Fox management, having seen the critical role that [[soccer]] programming had played in the growth of British satellite service [[BSkyB]], believed that sports, and specifically professional football, would be the engine that would turn Fox into a major network the quickest.\n\n===Early bids===\nTo this end, Fox had bid aggressively for football broadcast rights almost from the start. It notably passed on the [[United States Football League]], which had hoped to move to fall in [[1986 USFL season|1986]], the same time Fox was to debut, and was seeking a broadcast contract. In 1987, Fox's first full year on the air, [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] initially hedged on renewing its contract to carry ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' \u2013 then the league's crown-jewel program \u2013 as was in the middle of negotiations to reach a new contract, due to an increased expense of the rights.<ref>{{cite news|title=Budget Ax Stalks Monday Night Football|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/g/GooglePM/LA/lib00086,0EF50EC87AEC50BF.html|work=[[Daily News (Los Angeles)|Daily News]]|publisher=NewsBank|date=July 14, 1986}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Fox's Ambitious Plans a Big Deal|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/g/GooglePM/MH/lib00246,0EB3667E1AB1C8F9.html|newspaper=[[Miami Herald]]|publisher=NewsBank|date=January 18, 1987}}</ref> Fox made an offer to the National Football League to acquire the ''Monday Night Football'' contract<ref>{{cite news|title=The Decline and Fall of Monday Night Football|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/latimes/access/1085461062.html?dids=1085461062:1085461062&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:AI&type=historic&date=Sep+05%2C+1986&author=&pub=Los+Angeles+Times&desc=The+Decline+and+Fall+of+Monday+Night+Football&pqatl=google|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=September 5, 1986}}</ref> for the same amount ABC that had been paying to carry the package,<ref>{{cite news|title=Fox Network Wants the NFL|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/newsday/access/104290638.html?dids=104290638:104290638&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Jan+15%2C+1987&author=By+Ben+Kubasik&pub=Newsday+(Combined+editions)&desc=Fox+Network+Wants+the+NFL&pqatl=google|author=Ben Kubasik|newspaper=[[Newsday]]|date=January 15, 1987}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Second Look the Television Networks: Coping With Change|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/boston/access/59445005.html?dids=59445005:59445005&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Feb+16%2C+1987&author=Ed+Siegel%2C+Globe+Staff&pub=Boston+Globe+(pre-1997+Fulltext)&desc=SECOND+LOOK+THE+TELEVISION+NETWORKS%3A+COPING+WITH+CHANGE&pqatl=google|author=Ed Seigel|newspaper=[[Boston Globe]]|date=February 16, 1987}}</ref> about US$1.3 billion at the time.

The time now filled by ''Fox NFL'' on Sunday afternoons during the fall and winter months was formerly in the control of the stations themselves (and still is to some extent outside of the NFL season, particularly during weeks when no sports programming is scheduled at all by the network, as well as on non-doubleheader weeks during the season), which usually filled the timeslots with either syndicated television series (both first-run and off-network) and/or movie blocks. The Sunday afternoon timeslot in the spring is filled by ''[[Fox NASCAR]]''{{'s}} coverage of the [[NASCAR]] [[Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series|Monster Energy Cup Series]].\n\n===Fox outbids CBS for the NFC package===\nSix years after its first attempt, the league's television contracts for both conferences and for the [[NBC Sunday Night Football|Sunday]] and Monday [[prime time]] football packages came up for renewal again in 1993.\n\nMany expected that the NFL would receive less money than the $3.6 billion for four years that ABC, CBS, NBC, TNT, and ESPN had paid in 1990.<ref name=\"reedy20181227\">{{Cite news |url=https://apnews.com/9816ca0d0b3546ac92353c655d40cab8 |title=How Fox\u2019s 25 seasons of covering the NFL changed the game |last=Reedy |first=Joe |date=2018-12-27 |access-date=2018-12-27 |agency=Associated Press |language=en-US}}</ref> Fox wanted the NFL to build credibility for its network. Knowing that it would likely need to bid considerably more than the incumbent networks, Fox bid $1.58 billion to obtain a four-year contract for the broadcast rights to the [[National Football Conference]] (NFC), exceeding CBS's bid by more than $100 million per year. The NFC was considered the more desirable conference (as opposed to the [[American Football Conference]] (AFC), whose television package was being carried at the time by [[NFL on NBC|NBC]]) due to its presence in most of the largest U.S. markets, such as [[New York Giants|New York City]], [[Chicago Bears|Chicago]], [[Philadelphia Eagles|Philadelphia]], and [[Dallas Cowboys|Dallas]]-of which the Cowboys were gaining a national following in the 90's.<ref name=\"curtis20181213\">{{cite web |url=https://www.theringer.com/nfl/2018/12/13/18137938/nfl-fox-deal-rupert-murdoch-1993-john-madden-terry-bradshaw-howie-long-jimmy-johnson-cbs-nbc |title=The Great NFL Heist: How Fox Paid for and Changed Football Forever |last=Curtis |first=Bryan |date=2018-12-13 |website=The Ringer |access-date=2018-12-13}}</ref>\n\nDespite having a few successful shows like ''The X-Files'', Fox still lacked credibility among viewers.

The network already had offbeat hits such as ''The Simpsons'', ''Married... with Children'', and ''[[Beverly Hills, 90210]]'' on its schedule. However, Fox did not have a sports division up to that point, and its [[Fox News Channel|news division]] was a few years away from fruition (most Fox stations outside of a few owned by the network did not even produce their own news programming), and most Fox affiliates were often either full-power [[Ultra high frequency|UHF]] stations or [[low-power broadcasting|low-powered]] stations. In addition, there were some smaller markets that were not yet served by a local Fox affiliate; back in 1991, the [[Foxnet]] cable channel began operations to provide the network's programming to those areas until a new over-the-air affiliate was made available.\n\n====CBS personalities move to Fox====\n{{see also|1994\u20131996 United States broadcast TV realignment|Repercussions of the 1994\u20131996 United States broadcast TV realignment}}\nThe vast resources that [[Rupert Murdoch]] had allowed the network to grow quickly, primarily to the detriment of CBS. After bringing in [[David Hill (producer)|David Hill]] from Murdoch's U.K.-based [[Sky Sports]] to head-up the new Fox Sports division, Fox began luring over members of the [[CBS Sports]] staff, hiring longtime producer Ed Goren as Hill's second-in-command. Fox was also able to procure [[Pat Summerall]] and [[John Madden]] to be its lead broadcast team, a capacity they had been serving for CBS. [[Terry Bradshaw]], who was previously co-host of ''[[The NFL Today]]'', was added to serve as the pregame show's lead analyst. [[Dick Stockton]] and [[Matt Millen]] also came over from CBS and became the network's #2 broadcast team, while [[James Brown (sportscaster)|James Brown]], who had called play-by-play for CBS' game telecasts, was hired to be the studio host.{{r|curtis20181213}}\n\nFox then sought to raise its station profile as the start of its NFL contract came closer by approaching other broadcasters about switching their [[Very high frequency|VHF]] stations (channels 2 to 13) to the network from one of the other established networks. On May 23, 1994, News Corporation struck an alliance with New World Communications, a television and film [[production company]] that by now was a key station group with several VHF CBS affiliates in NFC markets in its portfolio, and wary of a CBS without football.<ref name=nytbusinessdigest>{{cite news|title=FOX WILL SIGN UP 12 NEW STATIONS; TAKES 8 FROM CBS|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/24/us/fox-will-sign-up-12-new-stations-takes-8-from-cbs.html?pagewanted=4|author=Bill Carter|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=May 24, 1994|accessdate=October 22, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Fox and the New World order. |url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC-IDX/94-OCR/BC-1994-05-30-Page-0006.pdf |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6XUViq8UE?url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC-IDX/94-OCR/BC-1994-05-30-Page-0006.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=April 2, 2015 |author=Geoffrey Foisie |page=6 |work=Broadcasting and Cable |date=May 30, 1994 |accessdate=February 13, 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Fox and the New World order.|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC-IDX/94-OCR/BC-1994-05-30-0008.pdf|author=Geoffrey Foisie|page=8|work=Broadcasting and Cable|date=May 30, 1994|accessdate=February 13, 2013}}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Through the deal, in which also Fox purchased a 20% interest in the company, nearly all of New World's stations (including several that the company was in the process of acquiring from [[Taft Broadcasting|Citicasters]] and [[Hearst Television|Argyle Communications]] at the time the deal was struck) switched en masse to Fox beginning that September and continuing through September 1996 as existing affiliation contracts with their previous network partners came to an end (network subsidiary [[Fox Television Stations]] bought New World Communications outright in July 1996<ref>{{cite news|last=Lowry|first=Brian|title=New World Vision : Murdoch's News Corp. to Buy Broadcast Group|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1996-07-18/business/fi-25271_1_rupert-murdoch-s-news-corp|accessdate=June 22, 2012|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=July 18, 1996}}</ref>).\n\nIn the summer of 1994, [[SF Broadcasting]] (a recently formed [[joint venture]] between Fox and [[Savoy Pictures]]) purchased four stations from Burnham Broadcasting, which also became Fox affiliates between September 1995 and January 1996. In the NFC markets affected by the deals, Fox gained VHF affiliates in eight primary markets ([[WAGA-TV|Atlanta]], [[KDFW|Dallas]], [[WJBK|Detroit]], [[WLUK-TV|Green Bay]], [[WVUE-DT|New Orleans]], [[KSAZ-TV|Phoenix]], [[KTVI|St. Louis]] and [[WTVT|Tampa]]) and three satellite markets ([[KTBC (TV)|Austin]], [[WGHP|Greensboro]] and [[WITI (TV)|Milwaukee]]), adding to the [[WNYW|four]] [[KTTV|that]] [[KTVU|the network had]] [[WTTG|before the deal]]. The new affiliates in St. Louis and Greensboro switched shortly before the [[St. Louis Rams|Rams]] relocated from Los Angeles and the [[Carolina Panthers]] began play with the 1995 preseason. Besides giving the network leverage in attracting new affiliates, the rights gave Fox many new viewers and a platform for advertising its other shows.\n\nFox's acquisition of the National Football Conference contract severely affected CBS, beyond losing a marquee sporting event and some of its key talent and production staff. Not only was it largely relegated to former Fox affiliates and lesser known [[Independent station (North America)|independent stations]] in the markets affected by Fox's affiliation agreement with New World, but CBS' older-skewing programming slate caused it to struggle further in the [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]], pushing it to third place, ahead of fourth-place Fox. CBS had hoped to replace the NFL with [[National Hockey League]] rights, but Fox then promptly outbid CBS for those as well; in addition, Fox took over the rights to [[Major League Baseball]] in 1996, after the cancellation of [[The Baseball Network]], which was a joint venture between NBC and ABC at the time and had replaced CBS two years prior. CBS began rebuilding itself after the network took the AFC television contract from [[NFL on NBC|NBC]] in 1998.\n\n===A brand new era===\nFox's acquisition of National Football League television rights was a watershed event not only for the network, but for the NFL as well. Not only was it the event that placed Fox on a par with the \"Big Three\" broadcast networks, but it also ushered in an era of growth for the NFL, which continues on largely to this day. While the heavy concentration of major cities in NFC markets \u2013 as opposed to the smaller markets generally served by the AFC \u2013 virtually guaranteed a substantial audience, its instant success has nonetheless been remarkable given the differences between Fox's coverage and the coverage provided by [[Monday Night Football|ABC]], CBS, [[ESPN Sunday Night Football|ESPN]], [[NFL on TNT|TNT]] and NBC up to that time.\n\n====\"Same Game, New Attitude\"====\nFox used the slogan \"Same Game, New Attitude\" to promote its new NFL package{{r|curtis20181213}} (it did the same for its new [[Major League Baseball]] coverage in 1996). The network's pre-game show, ''[[Fox NFL Sunday]]'' focused more on entertainment and less on in-depth discussion of [[American football strategy|game strategy]]. Fox's NFL coverage also introduced bolder and innovative graphics, for instance, the [[FoxBox (sports)|FoxBox]], a continuous on-screen time-and-score graphic that Hill had originally used on [[Sky Sports]]'s coverage of the [[Premier League]]. It also used [[parabolic microphone]]s to include the sounds of the stands and of the on-field action (including conversations and strategy outlines between coaches and players). These innovations were adopted by rival networks and helped to drive the development of further innovations such as the on-air display of [[1st & Ten (graphics system)|virtual first-down and scrimmage lines]].\n\n=====1990s=====\nIn {{nfly|1989}}, [[John Madden]], then of [[NFL on CBS|CBS]] awarded the first \"Turkey Leg Award\", for the [[NFL on Thanksgiving Day|Thanksgiving Day game]]'s most valuable player. Pursuant to its name, it was an actual cooked turkey leg, and players typically took a celebratory bite out of the leg for the cameras during post-game interviews. The gesture was seen mostly as a humorous gimmick relating to Madden's famous [[turducken|multi-legged turkey]],<ref name=\"Madden11232016\">{{cite news|title=John Madden talks Thanksgiving, his health, Raiders rise, 49ers fall, NFL TV ratings|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/2016/11/23/john-madden-talks-thanksgiving-his-health-raiders-rise-49ers-fall-nfl-tv-ratings/|first=Cam|last=Imnam|newspaper=The Mercury News|date=November 23, 2016|accessdate=November 27, 2016}}</ref> Madden brought the award to Fox in {{nfly|1994}}, and it continued through 2001. Because of the loose and informal nature of the award, at times it has been awarded to multiple players. On one occasion in 1994, it was given to players of both teams.\n\nThe Week 15, [[1995 NFL season|1995]] match-up between the [[1995 Arizona Cardinals season|Arizona Cardinals]] and the [[1995 San Diego Chargers season|San Diego Chargers]] was part of an experiment by Fox where [[Terry Bradshaw]] and [[Jimmy Johnson (American football coach)|Jimmy Johnson]] provided analysis throughout the game with no play-by-play.\n\nAt the end of the [[1996 NFL season|1996 season]], Fox broadcast its first ever Super Bowl. Super Bowl XXXI would be the first of three Super Bowls to be called by [[Pat Summerall]] and John Madden while with Fox (Super Bowls [[Super Bowl XXXIII|XXXIII]] and [[Super Bowl XXXVI|XXXVI]] being the others). The telecast ended up being the highest-rated program in the history of the then ten-year-old Fox network, and it currently ties [[Super Bowl XLII]] for the highest-rated program in the entire history of the network. Fox's broadcast was also the first Super Bowl to have a constant, live-updating graphic for the score, time and down & distance. The [[FoxBox (sports)|FoxBox]] was used also in [[Super Bowl XXXIII]], and the graphic positioned over live action has become the norm in virtually all sports broadcasts at the national and regional production levels.\n\nFollowing the [[1997 NFL season|1997 season]], [[Joe Buck]] did not call another NFL game on Fox until [[2001 NFL season|2001]]. For Fox's first two years of NFL coverage, Buck was paired with [[Tim Green]] on the fourth-tier team. And in 1997, Buck was teamed with [[Bill Maas]] on the fourth-tier team. Between the [[1998 NFL season|1998]]-[[2000 NFL season|2000]] seasons, Buck would often be assigned to working at ''Fox NFL Sunday'' studio for halftime coverage whenever the main pregame crew was on the road. Kevin Harlan left Fox after this season to join the ''[[NFL on CBS]]''. Harlan and Bill Maas anchored Fox's halftime coverage for Week 6, as the ''Fox NFL Sunday'' crew did the pregame show from [[Green Bay, Wisconsin|Green Bay]]'s [[Lambeau Field]].\n\nIn [[1998 NFL season|1998]], Fox had a broadcast of the [[1998 Washington Redskins season|Washington Redskins]]/[[1998 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] game scheduled for Week 16. On the day the game was supposed to be broadcast, [[President of the United States|President]] [[Bill Clinton]] was [[Impeachment of Bill Clinton|impeached]] by [[United States Congress|Congress]] and Fox broke into local programming to cover the events. The football game (called by [[Sam Rosen (sportscaster)|Sam Rosen]] and [[Jerry Glanville]]) began as scheduled and was shown in [[Split screen (video production)|split screen]]. Jerry Glanville left Fox after this season to join ''[[The NFL Today]]'' on CBS.\n\nFor Fox's coverage of Super Bowl XXXIII at the end of the 1998 season, the starting lineups were shown using a virtual TV. To TV viewers, it appeared as if the end zone opened up and a giant TV came up out of the ground. The virtual TV displayed video announcing the starting lineups.

Madden would soon become the first person to announce Super Bowls on different networks in consecutive years when he called [[Super Bowl XXXVII]] on ABC with Michaels.\n\nFox's telecast of [[Super Bowl XXXVI]] was presented in a [[480p]] [[Enhanced-definition television|enhanced-definition]] [[16:9|widescreen]] format marketed as \"Fox Widescreen\". While promoted as having better quality than [[standard-definition television|standard-definition]], and being the first U.S. sporting event produced in a widescreen format with the same production as the main feed for standard-definition viewers (rather than using a separate production for the widescreen feed), it was not true [[high-definition television|high definition]], but still matched the [[aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]] of HDTV sets.<ref>{{cite web|title=FOX Sports to Present Super Bowl XXXVI In FOX Widescreen|url=http://creativemac.digitalmedianet.com/articles/viewarticle.jsp?id=7144|work=CreativeMac|date=January 7, 2002|accessdate=March 28, 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120319202358/http://creativemac.digitalmedianet.com/articles/viewarticle.jsp?id=7144|archivedate=March 19, 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"fox-ws-hd\">{{cite web|title=Fox Widescreen is not HD!|url=http://hd.engadget.com/2006/07/13/fox-widescreen-is-not-hd/|author=Ben Drawbaugh|website=[[Engadget]]|publisher=AOL|date=July 13, 2006|access-date=August 18, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110809131004/http://hd.engadget.com/2006/07/13/fox-widescreen-is-not-hd/|archive-date=August 9, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> As previously alluded to, this was Summerall's 26th and final Super Bowl broadcast on television or radio. It was also the eighth and final Super Bowl telecast (and final NFL telecast of any kind) for the Summerall and Madden announcing team. The two had become the NFL's most famous broadcast duo since they were paired together in [[1981 NFL season|1981]] on [[NFL on CBS|CBS]].\n\nJoe Buck, [[Troy Aikman]], and [[Cris Collinsworth]] replaced Pat Summerall and John Madden as the number 1 announcing team. Summerall however, would continue to work for Fox in [[2002 NFL season|2002]], calling almost all [[2002 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas Cowboys]] games alongside [[Brian Baldinger]]. One notable exception was in Week 8, when Summerall called the Cowboys-[[2002 Seattle Seahawks season|Seattle]] game alongside [[Daryl Johnston]] and Baldinger worked the [[2002 Arizona Cardinals season|Arizona]]-[[2002 San Francisco 49ers season|San Francisco]] game alongside [[Kenny Albert]]. At this point, it would become common practice for Joe Buck to take time off from calling NFL games in order to cover postseason baseball for [[Fox Major League Baseball|Fox]].\n\nWhen John Madden left Fox after 2001, the network introduced a new award for their Thanksgiving Day telecast starting in 2002, named the \"Galloping Gobbler.\" It was represented by a small figurine of a cartoonish, silver [[domesticated turkey|turkey]] wearing a football helmet<ref name=\"Fox-GG\">{{cite news|url=http://www.foxsports.com/nfl/laces-out/galloping-gobbler-an-evolution-of-greatness-112112|title=Galloping Gobbler: An evolution of greatness|publisher=Fox Sports|work=Laces Out \u2013 Fox Blog|date=November 21, 2013|accessdate=December 2, 2014}}</ref> striking a [[Heisman Trophy|Heisman-like]] pose.<ref name=\"geek\">{{cite news|url=http://www.sportsgeekery.com/3815/nfl-thanksgiving-day-football-history-and-fun-facts/|title=NFL Thanksgiving Day Football History, Trivia, and Fun Facts|publisher=Sports Geekery|date=November 24, 2014|accessdate=December 2, 2014}}</ref> Much like [[Fox NFL Sunday#Cleatus the Fox Sports Robot|Cleatus]] and [[Fox NASCAR#Criticisms|Digger]], the original Galloping Gobbler trophy reflected Fox's irreverent mascots, and went through several iterations.<ref name=\"Fox-GG\"/> Unimpressed by its tackiness after having won four Turkey Legs in the 1990s, the inaugural winner, [[Emmitt Smith]], famously threw the 2002 award into a trash can.<ref name=\"Fox-GG\"/>\n\nFollowing the [[2004 NFL season|2004 season]], Cris Collinsworth left Fox Sports. After sitting out the [[2005 NFL season|2005 season]], he returned to [[NFL on NBC|NBC Sports]] for the [[2006 NFL season|2006 season]]. For the 2006 season (the first after [[James Brown (sportscaster)|James Brown]] left to return to CBS as host of ''The NFL Today''), Fox experimented with a traveling pre-game show, hosted by Joe Buck from the site of the game to which he was assigned. The halftime and postgame shows were hosted by [[Curt Menefee]]. During Week 14 of the regular season, [[Thom Brennaman]], [[Charles Davis (defensive back)|Charles Davis]] and [[Barry Alvarez]] took over the #4 team for Sam Rosen and [[Tim Ryan (American football, born 1967)|Tim Ryan]].\n\nDuring Weeks 6\u20138 of the [[2006 NFL season|2006 regular season]], [[Dick Stockton]] filled in for Joe Buck, during the MLB playoffs. And during Weeks 6\u20138 of that same regular season, Kenny Albert filled in for Stockton, who was filling in for Buck. During Weeks 6\u20138 of the [[2007 NFL season|2007 regular season]], Kenny Albert filled in for Buck, during the MLB playoffs. During Week 6 and 7 of the 2007 regular season, [[Matt Vasgersian]] filled in for Albert, who was filling in for Buck. During Week 7 of the 2007 regular season, [[Matt Devlin (sportscaster)|Matt Devlin]] filled in for Vasgersian, who was filling in Albert. And during Week 8 of the 2007 regular season, Thom Brennaman filled in for Albert, who was filling in for Buck.\n\nNovember 8, [[2009 NFL season|2009]] (Week 9) featured a special two-hour pregame show originating in [[Afghanistan]]. The regular ''Fox NFL Sunday crew'' hosted the pregame show; [[Chris Rose]] served as studio host and anchored in-game highlights. [[John Lynch (American football)|John Lynch]] and [[Trent Green]] served as studio analysts for the halftime and postgame reports.\n\n=====2010s=====\n[[2010 NFL season|2010]] was Chris Rose's final season calling NFL games for Fox until he departed for [[MLB Network]]. Rose was a part of the eighth-tier team with [[Ross Tucker]]. During Week 5 of the regular season, [[Chris Myers]] filled in for Dick Stockton, who was calling MLB playoffs for [[Major League Baseball on TBS|TBS]]. Myers also filled in for in for Rose during Weeks 11 and 13 of the regular season. At this point, Joe Buck, Troy Aikman, and [[Pam Oliver]] became Fox's longest-tenured broadcast team, surpassing the team of Pat Summerall and John Madden. During Weeks 6-8 of the regular season, Thom Brennaman filled in for Buck during the MLB playoffs. During Weeks 15-17 of the regular season Charles Davis filled in for [[Jim L. Mora|Jim Mora]], who accepted the head coaching job at [[UCLA Bruins football|UCLA Bruins]] in [[2012 UCLA Bruins football team|2012]].\n\nDuring Week 6 of the [[2012 NFL season|2012 regular season]], Thom Brennaman was set to call the [[2012 New York Giants season|New York Giants]] vs. [[2012 San Francisco 49ers season|San Francisco 49ers]] football game instead of Joe Buck, who was scheduled to call the [[2012 National League Championship Series|National League Championship Series]]. Sam Rosen was scheduled to fill in for Thom Brennaman while Brennaman filled in for Buck. However, [[Fox Sports (United States)|Fox Sports]] president Eric Shanks brought up the idea of a two sport, same-day [[Doubleheader (television)|doubleheader]] if both [[2012 San Francisco Giants season|San Francisco]] and [[2012 St. Louis Cardinals season|St. Louis]] won their divisional series. When St. Louis beat [[2012 Washington Nationals season|Washington]] on Friday night, Buck went to San Francisco instead of [[Washington, D.C.]] and called both the 49ers football game and the Giants baseball game.\n\nFox did not send its #2 team of Kenny Albert, Daryl Johnston, and [[Tony Siragusa]] to cover the [[2012\u201313 NFL playoffs#Divisional playoffs|playoffs in 2012]], marking the first time since Fox acquired NFL rights that they did this. Instead the #3 team of Thom Brennaman and [[Brian Billick]] were in the booth for the Divisional Playoffs, as they called the [[2012 Seattle Seahawks season|Seattle Seahawks]] at [[2012 Atlanta Falcons season|Atlanta Falcons]] match-up. Chris Myers joined the Brennaman/Billick/Laura Okmin crew during the NFC Playoffs.\n\nAfter the 2012 season, [[Ron Pitts]] left Fox Sports after being part of the NFL broadcast team for 18 years and joined ''[[Celebrity Page|OK!TV]]''. [[Kevin Burkhardt]] replaced him. The [[2013 NFL season|following year]], Burkhardt, John Lynch, and Pam Oliver and Chris Myers called the [[2013\u201314 NFL playoffs#Divisional Playoffs|Divisional Playoff game]] between the [[2013 New Orleans Saints season|New Orleans Saints]] and the [[2013 Seattle Seahawks season|Seattle Seahawks]]. [[Erin Andrews]] joined Pam Oliver as sideline reporter for Wild Card weekend, NFC Championship, Thanksgiving, and [[Super Bowl XLVIII]].\n\nMeanwhile, [[Brian Billick]] was not offered a contract extension with the ''NFL on Fox'' after his contract expired after the 2013 season. Tim Ryan left Fox after 2013 when he accepted the job as the [[List of San Francisco 49ers broadcasters|San Francisco 49ers]] radio color commentator. And [[Tom McCarthy (sportscaster)|Tom McCarthy]] left Fox after 2013 and joined rival CBS. [[David Diehl]] replaced Billick as Thom Brennaman's analyst, while [[Ronde Barber]] replaced Ryan as Chris Myers' analyst. For Week 7, [[Tim Brando]] replaced [[Mike Goldberg]] after Goldberg performed poorly during a Week 6 game and cursed out his critics on [[Twitter]].\n\nDuring Weeks 6\u20138 of the 2013 season, Thom Brennaman filled in for Joe Buck, Sam Rosen filled in for Kevin Burkhardt, and [[Charissa Thompson]] filled in for Erin Andrews; Joe Buck, Kevin Burkhardt, and Erin Andrews were all on ''Fox Major League Baseball'' playoff duty. Meanwhile, [[Justin Kutcher]] filled in for Thom Brennaman. During Week 13 of the 2013 season, Dick Stockton, [[Brady Quinn]], and Kristina Pink were assigned [[Fox College Football|college football]] responsibilities, leading to a makeshift #6 team. As the rotational broadcaster Brennaman was moved down to fill in for Stockton. He was joined by [[Donovan McNabb]] and Charissa Thompson. Kutcher once again filled in for Brennaman. In Week 15, Kutcher again filled in for Brennaman because this time, Brennaman had voice problems.\n\nIn [[2015 NFL season|2015]], Charles Davis replaces David Diehl as Thom Brennaman's analyst. Meanwhile, Sam Rosen replaced Mike Goldberg and Tim Brando on the #7 team. Kirk Morrison moved down to the #7 team and was joined by [[Chris Cooley]] and [[Matt Millen]] as rotating analysts. Laura Okmin and Tony Siragusa swapped broadcast teams as sideline reporters/analysts, joining the #3 and #4 teams, respectively. Holly Sonders joined the #3 and #5 team as a rotating sideline reporter. [[Danielle Trotta]] joined [[Peter Schrager]] as a rotating reporter for the #7 broadcast team. Brady Quinn moved down to the #8 team, where he was joined by his CFB broadcast partner [[Joe Davis (sportscaster)|Joe Davis]]. On September 27, 2015, [[Richard Deitsch]] of [[Sports Illustrated|SI.com]] reported that, \"in an effort to get Holly Sonders reps as an NFL sideline reporter\", Fox Sports management pulled various assignments they had originally given Laura Okmin and Jennifer Hale on the #3 and #5 teams, respectively, and reassigned them to Sonders. The 2015 season marked Tony Siragusa's final season with Fox.\n\nDuring Weeks 5\u20138 of the 2015 season, Sam Rosen filled in for Kevin Burkhardt while Burkhardt worked the studio shows for Fox's MLB Playoff coverage. During Week 5, Justin Kutcher filled in for Kenny Albert while Albert worked the [[2015 American League Division Series|American League Division Series]] between [[2015 Texas Rangers season|Texas]] and [[2015 Toronto Blue Jays season|Toronto]]. During Weeks 6 and 8 Thom Brennaman filled in for Joe Buck, Kutcher filled in for Thom Brennaman, and Peter Schrager filled in for Erin Andrews during the MLB Playoffs.\n\nDuring Week 5 of the [[2016 NFL season|2016 season]], Kenny Albert had been scheduled to work the [[2016 Los Angeles Dodgers season|Los Angeles]]-[[2016 Washington Redskins season|Washington]] [[2016 National League Division Series|National League Division Series]] series and the [[2016 Washington Redskins season|Redskins]]-[[2016 Baltimore Ravens season|Ravens]] game. Both events occurred 40 miles apart from Friday to Sunday. Rain postponed the Game 2 of the NLDS to Sunday and Fox kept Albert on baseball coverage, with Sam Rosen taking his place alongside Daryl Johnston. Sam Rosen remained with Daryl Johnston in Weeks 6\u20138, while Kenny Albert was elevated to the #2 team with John Lynch. The 2016 season was John Lynch's last with Fox as he leave to become the general manager of the [[San Francisco 49ers]]. During Week 8, [[Matt \"Money\" Smith|Matt Smith]] filled in for Sam Rosen on #7 broadcast team during the MLB Playoffs. Rosen was with the #2 team in [[NFL International Series|London]], filling in for Kevin Burkhardt. During Weeks 6\u20138, Thom Brennaman filled in for Joe Buck while the latter called the [[2016 National League Championship Series|NLCS]] and [[2016 World Series|World Series]]. Justin Kutcher took Brennaman's place on the #4 announcing crew.\n\nDuring Weeks 5\u20138 of the [[2017 NFL season|2017 season]], Kenny Albert filled in for Kevin Burkhardt while Burkhardt worked the studio shows for Fox's MLB Playoff coverage. During Weeks 5\u20138, Sam Rosen filled in for Kenny Albert while he was with the #2 team. During Weeks 6\u20138, Thom Brennaman, for the 9th straight year, filled in for Joe Buck while the latter called the [[2017 American League Championship Series|ALCS]] and [[2017 World Series|World Series]]. Either [[Dan Hellie]] or Justin Kutcher took Thom Brennaman's place on the #4 announcing crew. Originally, [[Jay Cutler]] was slated to join Kevin Burkhardt and Charles Davis. Cutler ended up coming out of retirement for 2017, signing with the [[2017 Miami Dolphins season|Miami Dolphins]] due to the injury of [[Ryan Tannehill]].\n\nAlso in 2017, Ronde Barber and Daryl Johnston switched broadcast teams; Barber joined Kenny Albert and Johnston joined Chris Myers. [[Chris Spielman]] became Thom Brennaman's permanent broadcast partner. However, he became Dan Hellie's temporary partner for Weeks 6 and 7 and Justin Kutcher's temporary partner for Week 8. David Diehl became Sam Rosen's permanent partner except for Week 14 when Brady Quinn joined Rosen and for Week 17 when Matt Millen joined him. [[Greg Jennings]] became Tim Brando's temporary partner for the [[2017 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|Buccaneers]]-[[2017 Green Bay Packers season|Packers]] game on Week 13. Meanwhile, [[Mark Schlereth]] joined Fox Sports this year and became Dick Stockton's broadcast partner.\n[[Mike Pereira]], who previously served as offsite rules analyst, moved to an on-site role with the lead broadcast team for select games. [[Dean Blandino]], who recently resigned from his title as VP of Officiating earlier in the year, replaced Pereira as rules analyst when Pereira was on those select games.\n\nDuring Week 8 of the [[2018 NFL season|2018 season]], for the first time, Thom Brennaman filled in for Kenny Albert as the number 3 team while Joe Buck did the [[2018 World Series|World Series]] from [[Dodger Stadium]], 5 miles away. Buck remained on ''[[Thursday Night Football]]'', going to [[Houston]] on the World Series' travel day from [[Boston]] to [[Los Angeles]], but he waived the opportunity for a same-day, two-sport doubleheader on Sunday over concerns about getting from one venue to the other in [[Transportation in Los Angeles|L.A.]] [[Traffic congestion|traffic]]. With Kristina Pink moving to a co-sideline reporter for ''Thursday Night Football'', the #3 team of Kenny Albert/Ronde Barber had rotating sideline reporters throughout the season.\n\n===Post-game show: ''The OT''===\nBeginning in [[2005 NFL season|2005]], Fox's post-game show was expanded to an hour-long slot (regularly scheduled at 7:30&nbsp;p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Time]]) and branded as ''The OT'' (a possibly intentional nod to the title of the Fox drama series ''[[The O.C.]]''), competing against NBC's primetime pregame ''[[Football Night in America]]''. The program, in addition to providing analysis of the day's NFL games, sends viewers to the remaining ongoing regional games after their main game ends (or meets the NFL's rules regarding a switch to a more compelling matchup, outside of home markets) until the end of the last game.\n\nFox had previously scheduled first-run sitcoms, the comedic video series ''[[The World's Funniest!]]'', and animated series in the 7:00&nbsp;p.m. hour during the NFL season, but these were often subjected to pre-emption (resulting in episodes being delayed by one week or more) due to overruns of late afternoon games into the hour, which impacted their ratings performance; as a result of the postgame show's expansion, the network generally delayed carriage of first-run programming during the first hour of Sunday prime time to midseason (one exception was the freshman sitcom ''[[Mulaney]]'' in 2014, which was pushed to the hour that November due to struggling ratings in its original 9:30 Eastern slot), primarily limited to [[burned off|burn-offs]] of already failed series.\n\n===Changes for 2006===\nAfter the [[2005 NFL season|2005]] season, James Brown left Fox to return to [[CBS Sports]], where he would become the host of the CBS network's NFL pregame show ''The NFL Today''. On August 16, [[2006 NFL season|2006]], after weeks of speculation, the network officially announced that [[Joe Buck]] would take over the role as host vacated by Brown. The move also resulted in the show switching from being broadcast from a permanent Los Angeles studio to a portable studio configuration, similar to the pregame show for ''[[NASCAR on Fox]]'', in which analysts [[Terry Bradshaw]], [[Howie Long]] and [[Jimmy Johnson (American football coach)|Jimmy Johnson]] joined Buck at the stadium site to which Buck is assigned as [[play-by-play]] announcer for one of that week's telecasts. [[Curt Menefee]] worked all halftime shows and all postgame shows on Sundays when no doubleheader was scheduled, also from the same game site with the same analysts. Menefee hosted ''Fox NFL Sunday'' during the several weeks in October when Buck was not available; during that time, Buck called [[Major League Baseball on Fox|Major League Baseball]] postseason games, including the [[World Series]]. The pregame shows on October 15, 22 and 29 were broadcast from the Los Angeles studios; the show returned to the road on November 5.\n\nIt was also announced that weather reporter Jillian Barberie (now [[Jillian Reynolds (TV personality)|Jillian Reynolds]]) would not return for the coming season, as Barberie wished to stay at home in Los Angeles with her family.<ref>{{cite news|title=PGA on the web: Something for office workers|url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/columnist/hiestand-tv/2006-08-16-hiestand-pga_x.htm|author=Michael Hiestand|work=[[USA Today]]|date=August 16, 2006|accessdate=2009-07-31}}</ref> Barberie did participate in at least one of the studio shows. During the 2006 season, [[Chris Rose]] provided [[voice-over|narrated]] updates highlighting other NFL games during the Fox broadcasts from the Los Angeles studio.\n\nOn November 17, [[2006 NFL season|2006]], a source told the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' that the final two pregame shows of the [[2006 NFL season|2006 season]] would take place in the Los Angeles studios, with Buck hosting and [[Dick Stockton]] taking Buck's place on play-by-play duties at the games alongside [[Troy Aikman]]. The source cited that declining [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]] no longer justified its high production costs, including [[security]] [[expenses]]. A Fox spokesman would only say that changes were being considered.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\n====Changes for 2007====\nAfter the 2006 NFL season, ''Fox NFL Sunday'' returned to the Los Angeles studio throughout the entire 2007 regular season and for the two weeks of that year's postseason.  Curt Menefee became the full-time host of the pregame show, while Joe Buck reverted to strictly handling play-by-play duties.\n\n===2010 Monday night special===\nFox presented a limited Monday night game between the [[2010 New York Giants season|New York Giants]] and [[2010 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota Vikings]] on December 13, [[2010 NFL season|2010]]. The game had been originally scheduled to be played on the afternoon on December 12, but due to the collapse of the roof of the [[Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome|Metrodome]] early that morning due to weight from heavy snowpack, the game was moved on short notice to [[Ford Field]] in [[Detroit]] as that facility already had their full television setup still in place after a [[2010 Green Bay Packers season|Packers]]\u2013[[2010 Detroit Lions season|Lions]] game. Fox Sports had kept their cameras on in the Metrodome overnight the night before the originally scheduled game day and captured the stadium roof collapse in full detail; the video of the early morning collapse, captured at multiple angles, aired on that day's edition of ''Fox NFL Sunday'' and quickly went [[viral video|viral]].\n\nThe game was only made available on the main Fox stations in the New York and [[Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul|Twin Cities]] media markets; owned-and-operated station [[WNYW]] and affiliate [[WXXA-TV]] aired the game in the New York City and [[Albany, New York|Albany]] television markets, while [[Minneapolis]]\u2013[[St. Paul, Minnesota|St. Paul]] owned-and-operated station [[KMSP-TV]], and affiliates [[KXLT-TV]] in [[Rochester, Minnesota|Rochester]] and [[KQDS-TV]] in [[Duluth, Minnesota]] carried the game for the Vikings' markets. The game was also carried on satellite provider [[DirecTV]] through its [[NFL Sunday Ticket]] package.\n\nCoincidentally, this was the first game since [[1992 NFL season|1992]] that [[Brett Favre]] did not start an NFL game, as he was placed on the inactive list due to a shoulder injury, ending his streak of 297 consecutive regular season games; [[Tarvaris Jackson]] started in his place and subsequently [[Joe Webb]] had his first ever down in an NFL game. In addition, it was the first ever regular-season Monday night game in Ford Field.\n\nThis was the first time that either CBS or Fox produced a Monday night game that would only be broadcast in the markets of the competing teams; a similar situation would later happen on November 24, 2014, when CBS televised a Monday night game between the [[New York Jets]] and the [[Buffalo Bills]] that was relocated from [[Ralph Wilson Stadium]] to Ford Field due to a [[November 2014 North American blizzard|major lake-effect snowstorm]] that affected [[Western New York]].\n\n===Long term contract extension, ''Thursday Night Football'' (2018\u20132022)===\nOn December 14, 2011, the NFL, along with Fox, [[NBC Sunday Night Football|NBC]] and [[NFL on CBS|CBS]], and [[Monday Night Football|ESPN]] announced that the league had extended rights deal with all three networks through the 2022 season. The three-network rights deal includes the continued yearly rotation of the Super Bowl between Fox, NBC and CBS, meaning that Fox would air Super Bowls [[Super Bowl XLVIII|XLVIII]] (2014), [[Super Bowl LI|LI]] (2017), [[Super Bowl LIV|LIV]] (2020), and [[Super Bowl LVII|LVII]] (2023).<ref>{{cite news|title=NFL extends broadcast agreements through 2022, generating billions|url=http://blog.chron.com/ultimatetexans/2011/12/nfl-extends-broadcast-agreements-through-2022-generating-billions/|author=David Barron|work=[[Houston Chronicle]]|date=December 14, 2011|accessdate=December 19, 2011}}</ref> The contract included a new \"cross-flexing\" policy introduced in [[2014 NFL season|2014]], under which a limited number of all-AFC games normally assigned to CBS may now be moved to Fox, and vice versa with NFC games.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/entertainment/tv/z-on-tv-blog/bs-sp-zontv-ravens-column-0907-20140904-story.html|title=Big changes in store for CBS' NFL coverage this season|last=Zurawik|first=David|work=Baltimore Sun|access-date=2018-01-31|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nOn January 31, 2018, the NFL announced that Fox had acquired the broadcast television rights to the ''[[Thursday Night Football]]'' package from 2018 through 2022.

The music was partially inspired by the opening theme of [[Tim Burton]]'s 1989 ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]'' film; Fox Sports president David Hill had heard the theme while waiting in line for a ''[[Batman]]'' ride at an amusement park in California, and suggested to creative director George Greenberg (who had recently defected to Fox from [[ESPN on ABC|ABC Sports]]) in a phone call that the overlying theme for Fox's NFL theme music should be \"Batman plays football\".

In particular, current Fox Sports president Eric Shanks believed that the special theme music it had previously used for post-season baseball was not upbeat enough, and that the change would \"[give] all of our sports sort of that marquee feel and it gives us a more upbeat way to come on the air.\" The change also resulted in the removal of the long-time ''[[Major League Baseball on Fox]]'' theme (also composed by Schreer).<ref name=deadspin-howwasborn/><ref name=aolnews-bullpen>{{cite web|title=FOX Goes to Musical Bullpen for MLB Playoffs |url=http://www.aolnews.com/2010/10/26/fox-goes-to-musical-bullpen-for-mlb-playoffs/ |work=AOL News |accessdate=February 5, 2014 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20120723044951/http://www.aolnews.com/2010/10/26/fox-goes-to-musical-bullpen-for-mlb-playoffs/ |archivedate=July 23, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In 2018-2019 ''[[Fox College Hoops]]'' started to use ''[[Roundball Rock]]'' (the [[John Tesh]] composition that is best known as the ''[[NBA on NBC]]'' theme from 1990 to 2002) for games on the FOX network, after previously sharing the CFB on FOX theme for [[Fox College Football|college football broadcasts]], which still use the latter theme.<ref>{{cite news|last=Curtis|first=Charles|title=Fox Sports is bringing John Tesh's iconic 'Roundball Rock' back to basketball broadcasts|url=https://ftw.usatoday.com/2018/12/fox-sports-roundball-rock-nba-on-nbc-theme-john-tesh-video|publisher=[[Gannett Company]]|newspaper=[[USA Today]]|language=en|date=December 7, 2018|access-date=March 11, 2019}}</ref>\n\nAs of September 27, 2018 starting with Fox's first ''Thursday Night Football'' broadcast, the ''NFL on Fox'' theme music is used on ''TNF'' games aired on Fox and NFL Network, mainly for the pregame and halftime studio show.\n\nSchreer's music for ''NFL on Fox'' was also used for the [[NFL on Sky Sports|NFL coverage]] on [[Sky Sports]] between 2013 and 2018.\n\n===In-game music===\nIn December [[2010 NFL season|2010]], Fox experimented with using an in-game soundtrack during a regional game between the [[2010 Arizona Cardinals season|Arizona Cardinals]] and [[2010 Carolina Panthers season|Carolina Panthers]].

Fox Sports president Eric Shanks revealed that ''[[CSI: Miami]]'' composer [[Jeff Cardoni]] had contributed music for the experiment, and saw potential in the concept, explaining that \"just like music in movies, you have to use it at the right times.

The basic design of the scoring bug, which was named the \"FoxBox\", mimicked the version used on Fox's MLB coverage. For Fox's coverage of [[Super Bowl XXXIII]] at the end of the [[1998 NFL season|1998 season]], the starting lineups were shown using a virtual television. To television viewers, the effect appeared as if the end zone opened up and a giant television screen rose from the ground. The virtual television display showed video announcing the starting lineups. The virtual television effect was provided by [[PVI Virtual Media Services]] using its L-VIS virtual graphics system.\n\n===2001\u20132002===\nFor the [[2001 NFL season|2001 season]], NFL telecasts began using the same graphics that were previously introduced on Fox's NASCAR and Major League Baseball coverage.  The graphics package was an updated version of the 1998 design, but the FoxBox changed from a compact bug to a banner spanning the top of the screen, and included a scrolling graphic displaying real-time scores of other games in progress. A simple black rectangle with a shaded translucent area spanned the top of the screen from left to right, displaying the abbreviations of both teams in white. The scores were shown in white boxes next to the team. The center showed the game clock in white, to its right was the quarter (\"1st QTR\", \"2nd QTR\", etc.), and to the right of the quarter was the play clock; the ''NFL on Fox'' logo was on the far right. First seen during [[Super Bowl XXXVI]] and used full-time for the [[2002 NFL season|2002]] season, the white scoring boxes were re-colored to yellow. This was also the last year that the score graphic used an effect in which a team's initials flashed in its two primary colors accompanied by percussive sound beats when that team scored (for example, when the [[2002 Green Bay Packers season|Green Bay Packers]] scored a touchdown during a Fox telecast, the \"GB\" initials and box would flash in green and gold for a few seconds as the six points for the TD were added, then again with the extra point). This banner was used for ''Major League Baseball on Fox'' broadcasts through most of the 2004 season.\n\n===2003\u20132005===\n[[File:NFL-on-FOX-2003.png|thumb|200px|''NFL on Fox'' logo used from [[2003 NFL season|2003]] to [[2005 NFL season|2005]].]]\nFor the [[2003 NFL season|2003 season]], Fox's NFL coverage debuted a new graphics package.\n\nInstead of being a large black rectangle consistently, the score banner alternated between a large black rectangle and several small, black parallelograms, and the shaded area above it was removed.  Team logos were now used, in place of their abbreviations.  During the [[2003 NFL playoffs]] however, the logos were removed and the team abbreviations were rendered again in white lettering in the team's main color.\n\nThe banner returned to a large black rectangle at the start of the [[2004 NFL season|2004 season]].  The team logos returned, this time looking more \"three-dimensional\" in appearance and with their respective abbreviations beside the logos.  Electronic eggcrate in the team's primary color was used whenever that certain team calls timeout, scores a touchdown, or a field goal. It would be shown in red whenever the team challenges a play. In addition during a touchdown or field goal, the right side of the banner would have a split flashing \"light\", then the words \"TOUCHDOWN or FIELD GOAL (team)\" in the same electronic lettering scrolling left.\n\nMidway through [[2004 NFL season|2004]], the team logos were once again replaced with the abbreviations. First seen on the [[Major League Baseball on Fox|network's Major League Baseball]] postseason broadcasts that year, this time, they were rendered in electronic eggcrate lettering in the team's main color. When team-specific information was displayed in the banner, such as the [[wikt:hang time|hang time]] of a punt or a touchdown, the abbreviation would revert to the team's logo. During the 2005 holiday season, for the Week 15 Saturday game (between the [[2005 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] and [[2005 New England Patriots season|New England Patriots]]), a new white banner, resembling a chrome finish (first introduced at the start of Fox's coverage of the [[2005 World Series]]) debuted, with animated snow accumulating on top with an animated snowplow periodically clearing the snow from the screen. The following week, the new banner was adopted for all games, however without the snow animation. The team abbreviations became white letters against the team's main color. This banner was used for ''Major League Baseball on Fox'' broadcasts through the [[2007 Major League Baseball season|2007 season]].\n\n===2006\u20132009===\n[[File:Nfl on fox.png|thumb|200px|''NFL on Fox'' logo used from [[2006 NFL season|2006]] to [[2013 NFL season|2013]].]]\nFox Sports again unveiled a new graphics package for its NFL coverage at the start of the [[2006 NFL season|2006 season]].  The score banner began featuring the real-time scores as a permanent fixture on the extreme right side, while the coloring of the banner changes to the colors of the team currently possessing the ball. During playoff games and games featured on days other than the network's traditional game broadcast days or holidays (such as the [[NFL on Thanksgiving Day|Thanksgiving Day]] AFC/NFC game), the scoring bar instead shows either the NFL Thanksgiving logo, the NFL Divisional Playoffs/NFC Championship logo, or a special banner with a message from Fox Sports observing whichever holiday falls during that week (for instance, [[confetti]] and a party horn with a traditional ''[[New Year's Day|Happy New Year]]'' message).\n\n[[File:NFL on FOX.png|thumb|200px|Alternate ''NFL on Fox'' logo used from 2003 to [[2013 NFL season|2013]].]]\nAt the beginning of the 2006 season, a virtual on-field graphic showing an arrow pointing towards the direction of advancement and the down/yardage information began to be used on all plays. This feature was then added by [[NFL on CBS|CBS]], [[NBC Sunday Night Football|NBC]], [[NFL Network]] (for its ''[[Run to the Playoffs]]'' game telecasts) and (beginning with the [[2008 NFL season|2008 season]]) [[Monday Night Football|ESPN]]. At the same time, the down/yardage information is also displayed on the scoring banner, resulting in duplicate presentation of the same information. The bar was also enhanced for [[High-definition television|high definition]] and is thinner than previous versions, with little translucency. The ''NFL on Fox'' logo was also repositioned to the far left instead of the far right. During high definition broadcasts, the area above the banner features a translucent slanting pattern going from left-to-right across the screen. During the 2006 preseason telecasts, the quarter was indicated by four illuminating buttons (the number of buttons that were lit indicated the quarter being played), but due to difficulties in visibility, the quarter returned to being numerically represented for the regular season. On the rare occasion during a game in which the field lines are not visible (such as those dealing with snow or rain), a small bug pops up on the bottom left side of the screen with the logo of the team that is currently in possession as well as text indicating where the ball is (e.g., Arizona-Own 41 Yard Line).\n\nBeginning on November 15, 2009 (Week 11 of the [[2009 NFL season|2009 season]]), scores from other ongoing NFL games that appear on the right side of the banner would have an arrow indicating which team was in possession of the ball; a red arrow indicated that the team is at the [[Red zone (gridiron football)|red zone]]. Fox's NFL telecasts were the only major telecasts of the league's games to not feature timeout indicators until the [[2010 NFL season|2010 season]], save for the number of timeouts that each team has on the right side of the banner.\n\n====December 31, 2006 San Francisco/Denver game====\nThere was one exception to this package for the 2006 season, as Fox had to revert to the then-current scoring banner and graphics package used by [[Fox Sports Networks|Fox Sports Net]] (and formerly the main one used by Fox Sports) for its final regular season game of the year, the [[2006 San Francisco 49ers season|San Francisco 49ers]] vs. the [[2006 Denver Broncos season|Denver Broncos]] on December 31, [[2006 NFL season|2006]], due to a [[Global storm activity of 2006#December 28 \u2013 January 1|blizzard (the second to occur in the span of a week)]] hitting [[Denver]], preventing the usual amount of equipment for Fox's NFL coverage to arrive before the game. [[FSN Rocky Mountain]] (the FSN network that served the Denver market at the time, since replaced by [[AT&T SportsNet Rocky Mountain]]) assisted in the production of the game on short notice by providing the graphical production and other production services. In addition, the \"[[1st & Ten (graphics system)|1st & Ten]]\" graphic lines denoting the [[line of scrimmage]] and [[Down (football)|first down line]] were unavailable for this broadcast. This graphic was also used in Week 5 of the 2007 season in a game between the [[2007 Arizona Cardinals season|Arizona Cardinals]] and [[2007 St. Louis Rams season|St. Louis Rams]].\n\n===2010\u20132013===\nA new graphics package for Fox's NFL telecasts debuted during an August 19, [[2010 NFL season|2010]] pre-season game, as the network began to broadcast its sports programming with graphics optimized for 16:9 displays rather than the [[4:3]] [[safe area (television)|safe area]], resulting in the network asking cable and satellite providers to comply and use the #10 [[Active Format Description]] code to send out over Fox programming, which displays 16:9 content in a [[letterboxing (filming)|letterboxed]] format on 4:3 screens (largely on the analog affiliate feed carried by the provider), in concert with [[Fox News Channel]] and its related news productions for the Fox network also switching to full widescreen presentation. This was promoted during that first game by the Fox broadcast team as giving a \"widescreen viewing experience\" to [[standard-definition television|standard definition]] viewers, using the usual examples of more video information on the screen to demonstrate the new presentation (such as two cheerleaders off to the side displayed in a widescreen shot, but cut out of a 4:3 shot).<ref>{{cite news|title=Fox Sports taking a wider view of football|url=http://www.jsonline.com/sports/102116644.html|newspaper=[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]]|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100905012943/http://www.jsonline.com/sports/102116644.html|archivedate=2010-09-05}}</ref>\n\nThe graphics package is an upgraded version of the 2006 design with a \"much more colorful 3D look\", implemented using a new infrastructure using products developed by [[Vizrt]], which was also rolled out to other Fox Sports networks in subsequent months.<ref>{{cite web|title=Fox Sports moves from Chyron to Vizrt|url=http://www.newscaststudio.com/blog/2010/08/25/fox-sports-moves-from-chyron-to-vizrt/|publisher=NewscastStudio|date=August 25, 2010|accessdate=August 17, 2012}}</ref> The score banner previously used was replaced by an unconventional FoxBox-styled layout, positioned in the top left corner of the screen, with team logos and scores on either side, lights indicating timeouts on the side rims, with the play clock and quarter positioned in the center. Initially, the [[play clock]] also appeared within the center area with 10 seconds remaining, sliding the time remaining in the quarter upward. However, the play clock indicator was soon moved to the bar sliding out of the bottom to show downage.\n\nDue to issues with some cable providers and Fox affiliates (particularly those carried by [[digital subchannel]]s or [[low-power broadcasting|low-power]] [[analog television|analog]] [[television station]]s) in implementing the AFD #10 widescreen mode, or for other broadcasters that still broadcast with content framed for 4:3 displays instead of defaulting to 16:9 like Fox (such as CBS and NBC, along with [[ESPN]] and [[NFL Network]] until they also switched to 16:9 with letterboxed SD feeds), feeds of Fox's NFL games have been offered with graphics positioned for 4:3 displays instead of 16:9, and in most cases, only one game per week was broadcast with 16:9 graphics.\n\nSmall tweaks were made for the [[2011 NFL season|2011 season]], including the timeout indicators counting upward instead of downward, and the possession indicator now appearing alongside the team that currently is in possession of the ball. Additionally, the scoreboard next to the Fox Sports bug for other ongoing NFL games was replaced by a traditional ticker; the bug was made slightly smaller and rounder as well. Special holiday animations also appeared with the banner package; digitally animated leaves fell on top of the FoxBox on [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]], while falling snow piles on top during the last two weeks of December in observance of the [[Christmas and holiday season]], with the timeout indicators being changed in the latter instance to resemble strings of [[Christmas lights]].\n\nAfter two years of using the unconventional layout, for [[2012 NFL season|2012]], a more traditional FoxBox was introduced; team abbreviations (in the team's primary color) are stacked on the left side of the box, with timeout lights positioned underneath each team abbreviation, and a possession indicator to the left of it. The clock/quarter indicator is on the right side. Down and distance pops out of the bottom, while the timeout/penalty/touchdown animation is the same as in the unconventional design of the previous two seasons. Also for the 2012 season, Fox began providing play-by-play commentary of all games in Spanish on its [[second audio program]] channel. In 2013, in observance of the [[Christmas holiday season|holiday season]], Christmas lights returned to the FoxBox along the sides of the graphic, but they no longer correspond to timeouts. When a team scores, calls a timeout or gets called on a penalty, the lights change from red, green and blue to the corresponding team's color for the duration of the graphic, before returning to the normal colors.\n\n===2014\u20132016===\nFor the [[2014 NFL season|2014 season]], the graphics were changed to match those that had previously been introduced on Fox Sports's Major League Baseball and NASCAR coverage. The graphics package itself is similar to the previous look, however with a more boxy appearance, and the fonts used are rounder and have less of an athletic appearance than previous packages used by Fox. The layout of the score box is essentially a mirror image of the already-introduced MLB graphic, except that the NFL version is on the top-left of the screen, while the baseball version was originally on the bottom-left (it was moved to the bottom-right beginning in 2016). Like the MLB graphic, the box has two components: a main box and a dynamic strip. The main box contains the team abbreviations, stacked on top of the team scores. The possession indicator is a line above the team holding the ball; timeout indicators, which are counting downward, are stacked next to the scores. This unconventional layout of displaying the scores (also used in 2010 and 2011) is only used for NFL coverage; college football and MLB coverage use the traditional layout with the team abbreviations to the left of the scores.\n\nThe dynamic strip normally shows the next down that will occur, such as \"3rd Down\". It changes to show down and distance and the play clock, and turns yellow if a flag is thrown. When a score occurs, the dynamic strip disappears and the main box changes to show the logo of the team scoring, along with the type of score (\"TOUCHDOWN\", \"FIELD GOAL\", \"SAFETY\"). For a penalty, the main box shows the logo of the offending team, while the dynamic strip turns yellow and displays the type of penalty. When a timeout is called, the dynamic strip turns to the color of the team taking the timeout and displays \"Timeout\", while the main box displays the team's logo over a neutral gray background. After a few seconds, the main box returns to the scores and a small gray box with the team logo appears next to the word \"Timeout\" in the dynamic strip.\n\nFor a review or a challenge, the dynamic strip moves from the bottom to the right side of the main box and turns red, displaying whether it is a challenge, an official review, or a scoring review. When the decision is announced, the strip expands to show the result of the review on a yellow background. After a few seconds, the strip shifts back to the bottom of the main box and if a timeout is charged on a lost challenge, the strip shows the team charged with the timeout.\n\nFor regular season games only, beginning with Week 3 of 2016, the record for each team was added to the box, making the team abbreviations of each team smaller.\n\nFox gradually worked elements of a new square-edged graphics package with thinner fonts into secondary situations during the 2016 season. This package (in white instead of black) was used for Fox's Super Bowl LI pregame, halftime, and post game shows, but the game broadcast itself continued to use the 2014 package. However, the translucent shading around the scoreboard was removed for the Super Bowl.\n\n===2017\u20132019===\nStarting on August 27, 2017, after three years of using the unconventional layout from the previous graphics package, a new, traditional score bar was introduced.  The score bug was moved from the top left to across the bottom of the screen and is now horizontal.  Additionally, team names are displayed instead of their abbreviations and the clock is located towards the right of the bug and the down and distance is displayed on the far right.  Also, timeout indicators are shown below the team names and the possession indicator, which was originally shown below the team's score (through Week 4 of the [[2017 NFL season]]), is now shown above the team's score. When showing stats or player info, the score bug briefly moves to the bottom left of the screen then returns to its previous position.  With this, all five of the NFL's broadcast partners (CBS, ESPN, Fox, NBC and NFL Network) now have score bars across the bottom of the screen, with Fox being the last of the five to make the switch.\n\nAs for the graphics package itself, it is an upgraded version of the 2014 design and eventually, it has rolled out on almost all of Fox Sports' properties, including Fox's [[Fox College Football|college football]] and basketball coverage on Fox and FS1, the [[2017 Major League Baseball season|2017 MLB postseason]] and on February 2018, ''[[Fox NASCAR|NASCAR on Fox]]''.\n\nFor NFL playoff games and ''[[Thursday Night Football]]'', which Fox picked up in 2018, the yellow-and-black \"Fox NFL\" logo on-screen and on graphics and transitions is replaced by a blue-and-white \"Fox\" or \"Fox|NFL Network\" logo respectively. In some transitions, it is instead replaced by the full \"TNF presented by Bud Light\" logo. Fox also produces NFL Network exclusives on non-Fox/NBC Thursdays, on some Sunday mornings, and on late-season Saturdays; these games replace the \"Fox NFL\" logo with an NFL Network logo on a black square, the size of the \"Fox NFL\" logo.\n\nFormer [[New England Patriots]] tight end [[Rob Gronkowski]] was hired by [[Fox Sports]] as an analyst for its NFL programming.<ref name=\":9\">{{Cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2019/10/rob-gronkowski-fox-sports-nfl-analystthursday-night-football-pregame-1202755145/|title=Rob Gronkowski Joins Fox Sports As NFL Analyst After Three Super Bowl Wins With Patriots|last=Pedersen|first=Erik|last2=Pedersen|first2=Erik|date=2019-10-08|website=Deadline|language=en|access-date=2019-10-09}}</ref> He debuted on October 10, 2019 for the network's ''NFL Thursday Pregame Show''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2019/10/08/sport/rob-gronkowski-fox-sports-trnd/index.html|title=Rob Gronkowski is back, but this time as an NFL analyst on FOX Sports|author=Allen Kim|website=CNN|access-date=2019-10-09}}</ref>\n\n===2020\u2013present===\nDuring [[Super Bowl LIV]], Fox introduced a new on-air appearance for its NFL and XFL broadcasts, replacing the previous rectangular appearance with a slanted motif. Some lower thirds incorporated use of fonts based on the teams' respective wordmark logos, and selected players were depicted in these and other graphics using stylized illustrations rather than traditional photos. The scoreboard was also changed to a more box-like appearance, showing only team logos, and with both teams positioned in opposing directions. Translucent strips were used to show quarterback statistics following each play.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sportsvideo.org/2020/02/02/live-from-super-bowl-liv-fox-sports-set-to-debut-new-graphics-look-for-big-game/|title=Live from Super Bowl LIV: Fox Sports Set to Debut New Graphics Look for Big Game|last=Kerschbaumer|first=Ken|website=Sports Video Group|language=en|access-date=February 3, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://awfulannouncing.com/fox/new-super-bowl-graphics-fox-scorebug-font-cartoons.html|title=Fox's new Super Bowl graphics include centered scorebug, italics, cartoons|date=2020-02-03|website=Awful Announcing|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-04}}</ref> The graphics carried over to [[XFL (2020)|XFL]] broadcasts the next week when the league re-launched.\n\n==Nielsen ratings==\n[[File:NFL on Fox booth at Candlestick Park 11-16-08.JPG|thumb|The ''NFL on Fox'' booth at [[Candlestick Park]] during a game on November 16, 2008.

The time now filled by ''Fox NFL'' on Sunday afternoons during the fall and winter months was formerly in the control of the stations themselves (and still is to some extent outside of the NFL season, particularly during weeks when no sports programming is scheduled at all by the network, as well as on non-doubleheader weeks during the season), which usually filled the timeslots with either syndicated television series (both first-run and off-network) and/or movie blocks.

The NFC was considered the more desirable conference (as opposed to the [[American Football Conference]] (AFC), whose television package was being carried at the time by [[NFL on NBC|NBC]]) due to its presence in most of the largest U.S. markets, such as [[New York Giants|New York City]], [[Chicago Bears|Chicago]], [[Philadelphia Eagles|Philadelphia]], and [[Dallas Cowboys|Dallas]]-of which the Cowboys were gaining a national following in the 90's.<ref name=\"curtis20181213\">{{cite web |url=https://www.theringer.com/nfl/2018/12/13/18137938/nfl-fox-deal-rupert-murdoch-1993-john-madden-terry-bradshaw-howie-long-jimmy-johnson-cbs-nbc |title=The Great NFL Heist: How Fox Paid for and Changed Football Forever |last=Curtis |first=Bryan |date=2018-12-13 |website=The Ringer |access-date=2018-12-13}}</ref>\n\nDespite having a few successful shows like ''The X-Files'', Fox still lacked credibility among viewers.

The network already had offbeat hits such as ''The Simpsons'', ''Married... with Children'', and ''[[Beverly Hills, 90210]]'' on its schedule. However, Fox did not have a sports division up to that point, and its [[Fox News Channel|news division]] was a few years away from fruition (most Fox stations outside of a few owned by the network did not even produce their own news programming), and most Fox affiliates were often either full-power [[Ultra high frequency|UHF]] stations or [[low-power broadcasting|low-powered]] stations. In addition, there were some smaller markets that were not yet served by a local Fox affiliate; back in 1991, the [[Foxnet]] cable channel began operations to provide the network's programming to those areas until a new over-the-air affiliate was made available.\n\n====CBS personalities move to Fox====\n{{see also|1994\u20131996 United States broadcast TV realignment|Repercussions of the 1994\u20131996 United States broadcast TV realignment}}\nThe vast resources that [[Rupert Murdoch]] had allowed the network to grow quickly, primarily to the detriment of CBS. After bringing in [[David Hill (producer)|David Hill]] from Murdoch's U.K.-based [[Sky Sports]] to head-up the new Fox Sports division, Fox began luring over members of the [[CBS Sports]] staff, hiring longtime producer Ed Goren as Hill's second-in-command. Fox was also able to procure [[Pat Summerall]] and [[John Madden]] to be its lead broadcast team, a capacity they had been serving for CBS. [[Terry Bradshaw]], who was previously co-host of ''[[The NFL Today]]'', was added to serve as the pregame show's lead analyst. [[Dick Stockton]] and [[Matt Millen]] also came over from CBS and became the network's #2 broadcast team, while [[James Brown (sportscaster)|James Brown]], who had called play-by-play for CBS' game telecasts, was hired to be the studio host.{{r|curtis20181213}}\n\nFox then sought to raise its station profile as the start of its NFL contract came closer by approaching other broadcasters about switching their [[Very high frequency|VHF]] stations (channels 2 to 13) to the network from one of the other established networks. On May 23, 1994, News Corporation struck an alliance with New World Communications, a television and film [[production company]] that by now was a key station group with several VHF CBS affiliates in NFC markets in its portfolio, and wary of a CBS without football.<ref name=nytbusinessdigest>{{cite news|title=FOX WILL SIGN UP 12 NEW STATIONS; TAKES 8 FROM CBS|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/05/24/us/fox-will-sign-up-12-new-stations-takes-8-from-cbs.html?pagewanted=4|author=Bill Carter|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=May 24, 1994|accessdate=October 22, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Fox and the New World order. |url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC-IDX/94-OCR/BC-1994-05-30-Page-0006.pdf |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/6XUViq8UE?url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC-IDX/94-OCR/BC-1994-05-30-Page-0006.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=April 2, 2015 |author=Geoffrey Foisie |page=6 |work=Broadcasting and Cable |date=May 30, 1994 |accessdate=February 13, 2013 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Fox and the New World order.|url=http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC-IDX/94-OCR/BC-1994-05-30-0008.pdf|author=Geoffrey Foisie|page=8|work=Broadcasting and Cable|date=May 30, 1994|accessdate=February 13, 2013}}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> Through the deal, in which also Fox purchased a 20% interest in the company, nearly all of New World's stations (including several that the company was in the process of acquiring from [[Taft Broadcasting|Citicasters]] and [[Hearst Television|Argyle Communications]] at the time the deal was struck) switched en masse to Fox beginning that September and continuing through September 1996 as existing affiliation contracts with their previous network partners came to an end (network subsidiary [[Fox Television Stations]] bought New World Communications outright in July 1996<ref>{{cite news|last=Lowry|first=Brian|title=New World Vision : Murdoch's News Corp. to Buy Broadcast Group|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1996-07-18/business/fi-25271_1_rupert-murdoch-s-news-corp|accessdate=June 22, 2012|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=July 18, 1996}}</ref>).\n\nIn the summer of 1994, [[SF Broadcasting]] (a recently formed [[joint venture]] between Fox and [[Savoy Pictures]]) purchased four stations from Burnham Broadcasting, which also became Fox affiliates between September 1995 and January 1996. In the NFC markets affected by the deals, Fox gained VHF affiliates in eight primary markets ([[WAGA-TV|Atlanta]], [[KDFW|Dallas]], [[WJBK|Detroit]], [[WLUK-TV|Green Bay]], [[WVUE-DT|New Orleans]], [[KSAZ-TV|Phoenix]], [[KTVI|St. Louis]] and [[WTVT|Tampa]]) and three satellite markets ([[KTBC (TV)|Austin]], [[WGHP|Greensboro]] and [[WITI (TV)|Milwaukee]]), adding to the [[WNYW|four]] [[KTTV|that]] [[KTVU|the network had]] [[WTTG|before the deal]]. The new affiliates in St. Louis and Greensboro switched shortly before the [[St. Louis Rams|Rams]] relocated from Los Angeles and the [[Carolina Panthers]] began play with the 1995 preseason. Besides giving the network leverage in attracting new affiliates, the rights gave Fox many new viewers and a platform for advertising its other shows.\n\nFox's acquisition of the National Football Conference contract severely affected CBS, beyond losing a marquee sporting event and some of its key talent and production staff. Not only was it largely relegated to former Fox affiliates and lesser known [[Independent station (North America)|independent stations]] in the markets affected by Fox's affiliation agreement with New World, but CBS' older-skewing programming slate caused it to struggle further in the [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]], pushing it to third place, ahead of fourth-place Fox. CBS had hoped to replace the NFL with [[National Hockey League]] rights, but Fox then promptly outbid CBS for those as well; in addition, Fox took over the rights to [[Major League Baseball]] in 1996, after the cancellation of [[The Baseball Network]], which was a joint venture between NBC and ABC at the time and had replaced CBS two years prior. CBS began rebuilding itself after the network took the AFC television contract from [[NFL on NBC|NBC]] in 1998.\n\n===A brand new era===\nFox's acquisition of National Football League television rights was a watershed event not only for the network, but for the NFL as well. Not only was it the event that placed Fox on a par with the \"Big Three\" broadcast networks, but it also ushered in an era of growth for the NFL, which continues on largely to this day. While the heavy concentration of major cities in NFC markets \u2013 as opposed to the smaller markets generally served by the AFC \u2013 virtually guaranteed a substantial audience, its instant success has nonetheless been remarkable given the differences between Fox's coverage and the coverage provided by [[Monday Night Football|ABC]], CBS, [[ESPN Sunday Night Football|ESPN]], [[NFL on TNT|TNT]] and NBC up to that time.\n\n====\"Same Game, New Attitude\"====\nFox used the slogan \"Same Game, New Attitude\" to promote its new NFL package{{r|curtis20181213}} (it did the same for its new [[Major League Baseball]] coverage in 1996). The network's pre-game show, ''[[Fox NFL Sunday]]'' focused more on entertainment and less on in-depth discussion of [[American football strategy|game strategy]]. Fox's NFL coverage also introduced bolder and innovative graphics, for instance, the [[FoxBox (sports)|FoxBox]], a continuous on-screen time-and-score graphic that Hill had originally used on [[Sky Sports]]'s coverage of the [[Premier League]]. It also used [[parabolic microphone]]s to include the sounds of the stands and of the on-field action (including conversations and strategy outlines between coaches and players). These innovations were adopted by rival networks and helped to drive the development of further innovations such as the on-air display of [[1st & Ten (graphics system)|virtual first-down and scrimmage lines]].\n\n=====1990s=====\nIn {{nfly|1989}}, [[John Madden]], then of [[NFL on CBS|CBS]] awarded the first \"Turkey Leg Award\", for the [[NFL on Thanksgiving Day|Thanksgiving Day game]]'s most valuable player. Pursuant to its name, it was an actual cooked turkey leg, and players typically took a celebratory bite out of the leg for the cameras during post-game interviews. The gesture was seen mostly as a humorous gimmick relating to Madden's famous [[turducken|multi-legged turkey]],<ref name=\"Madden11232016\">{{cite news|title=John Madden talks Thanksgiving, his health, Raiders rise, 49ers fall, NFL TV ratings|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/2016/11/23/john-madden-talks-thanksgiving-his-health-raiders-rise-49ers-fall-nfl-tv-ratings/|first=Cam|last=Imnam|newspaper=The Mercury News|date=November 23, 2016|accessdate=November 27, 2016}}</ref> Madden brought the award to Fox in {{nfly|1994}}, and it continued through 2001. Because of the loose and informal nature of the award, at times it has been awarded to multiple players. On one occasion in 1994, it was given to players of both teams.\n\nThe Week 15, [[1995 NFL season|1995]] match-up between the [[1995 Arizona Cardinals season|Arizona Cardinals]] and the [[1995 San Diego Chargers season|San Diego Chargers]] was part of an experiment by Fox where [[Terry Bradshaw]] and [[Jimmy Johnson (American football coach)|Jimmy Johnson]] provided analysis throughout the game with no play-by-play.\n\nAt the end of the [[1996 NFL season|1996 season]], Fox broadcast its first ever Super Bowl. Super Bowl XXXI would be the first of three Super Bowls to be called by [[Pat Summerall]] and John Madden while with Fox (Super Bowls [[Super Bowl XXXIII|XXXIII]] and [[Super Bowl XXXVI|XXXVI]] being the others). The telecast ended up being the highest-rated program in the history of the then ten-year-old Fox network, and it currently ties [[Super Bowl XLII]] for the highest-rated program in the entire history of the network. Fox's broadcast was also the first Super Bowl to have a constant, live-updating graphic for the score, time and down & distance. The [[FoxBox (sports)|FoxBox]] was used also in [[Super Bowl XXXIII]], and the graphic positioned over live action has become the norm in virtually all sports broadcasts at the national and regional production levels.\n\nFollowing the [[1997 NFL season|1997 season]], [[Joe Buck]] did not call another NFL game on Fox until [[2001 NFL season|2001]]. For Fox's first two years of NFL coverage, Buck was paired with [[Tim Green]] on the fourth-tier team. And in 1997, Buck was teamed with [[Bill Maas]] on the fourth-tier team. Between the [[1998 NFL season|1998]]-[[2000 NFL season|2000]] seasons, Buck would often be assigned to working at ''Fox NFL Sunday'' studio for halftime coverage whenever the main pregame crew was on the road. Kevin Harlan left Fox after this season to join the ''[[NFL on CBS]]''. Harlan and Bill Maas anchored Fox's halftime coverage for Week 6, as the ''Fox NFL Sunday'' crew did the pregame show from [[Green Bay, Wisconsin|Green Bay]]'s [[Lambeau Field]].\n\nIn [[1998 NFL season|1998]], Fox had a broadcast of the [[1998 Washington Redskins season|Washington Redskins]]/[[1998 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] game scheduled for Week 16. On the day the game was supposed to be broadcast, [[President of the United States|President]] [[Bill Clinton]] was [[Impeachment of Bill Clinton|impeached]] by [[United States Congress|Congress]] and Fox broke into local programming to cover the events. The football game (called by [[Sam Rosen (sportscaster)|Sam Rosen]] and [[Jerry Glanville]]) began as scheduled and was shown in [[Split screen (video production)|split screen]]. Jerry Glanville left Fox after this season to join ''[[The NFL Today]]'' on CBS.\n\nFor Fox's coverage of Super Bowl XXXIII at the end of the 1998 season, the starting lineups were shown using a virtual TV. To TV viewers, it appeared as if the end zone opened up and a giant TV came up out of the ground. The virtual TV displayed video announcing the starting lineups. The virtual TV effect was provided by [[PVI Virtual Media Services]] using their [[PVI Virtual Media Services|L-VIS]] virtual graphics system.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Anderson|first1=Karen|title=Super Bowl heats up with Frost|url=http://americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC/BC-1999/BC-1999-02-01.pdf|website=American Radio History|publisher=Broadcasting & Cable|accessdate=September 2, 2017|page=48|date=February 1, 1999}}</ref>\n\n=====2000s=====\n[[2001 NFL season|2001]] was the final year of commentating NFL games full-time for [[Pat Summerall]], as his retirement was announced earlier that year. 2001 was also [[John Madden]]'s last year of commentating on Fox, as he moved to [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] to commentate on ''[[Monday Night Football]]'' alongside [[Al Michaels]]. Madden would soon become the first person to announce Super Bowls on different networks in consecutive years when he called [[Super Bowl XXXVII]] on ABC with Michaels.\n\nFox's telecast of [[Super Bowl XXXVI]] was presented in a [[480p]] [[Enhanced-definition television|enhanced-definition]] [[16:9|widescreen]] format marketed as \"Fox Widescreen\". While promoted as having better quality than [[standard-definition television|standard-definition]], and being the first U.S. sporting event produced in a widescreen format with the same production as the main feed for standard-definition viewers (rather than using a separate production for the widescreen feed), it was not true [[high-definition television|high definition]], but still matched the [[aspect ratio (image)|aspect ratio]] of HDTV sets.<ref>{{cite web|title=FOX Sports to Present Super Bowl XXXVI In FOX Widescreen|url=http://creativemac.digitalmedianet.com/articles/viewarticle.jsp?id=7144|work=CreativeMac|date=January 7, 2002|accessdate=March 28, 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120319202358/http://creativemac.digitalmedianet.com/articles/viewarticle.jsp?id=7144|archivedate=March 19, 2012}}</ref><ref name=\"fox-ws-hd\">{{cite web|title=Fox Widescreen is not HD!|url=http://hd.engadget.com/2006/07/13/fox-widescreen-is-not-hd/|author=Ben Drawbaugh|website=[[Engadget]]|publisher=AOL|date=July 13, 2006|access-date=August 18, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110809131004/http://hd.engadget.com/2006/07/13/fox-widescreen-is-not-hd/|archive-date=August 9, 2011|url-status=dead}}</ref> As previously alluded to, this was Summerall's 26th and final Super Bowl broadcast on television or radio. It was also the eighth and final Super Bowl telecast (and final NFL telecast of any kind) for the Summerall and Madden announcing team. The two had become the NFL's most famous broadcast duo since they were paired together in [[1981 NFL season|1981]] on [[NFL on CBS|CBS]].\n\nJoe Buck, [[Troy Aikman]], and [[Cris Collinsworth]] replaced Pat Summerall and John Madden as the number 1 announcing team. Summerall however, would continue to work for Fox in [[2002 NFL season|2002]], calling almost all [[2002 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas Cowboys]] games alongside [[Brian Baldinger]]. One notable exception was in Week 8, when Summerall called the Cowboys-[[2002 Seattle Seahawks season|Seattle]] game alongside [[Daryl Johnston]] and Baldinger worked the [[2002 Arizona Cardinals season|Arizona]]-[[2002 San Francisco 49ers season|San Francisco]] game alongside [[Kenny Albert]]. At this point, it would become common practice for Joe Buck to take time off from calling NFL games in order to cover postseason baseball for [[Fox Major League Baseball|Fox]].\n\nWhen John Madden left Fox after 2001, the network introduced a new award for their Thanksgiving Day telecast starting in 2002, named the \"Galloping Gobbler.\" It was represented by a small figurine of a cartoonish, silver [[domesticated turkey|turkey]] wearing a football helmet<ref name=\"Fox-GG\">{{cite news|url=http://www.foxsports.com/nfl/laces-out/galloping-gobbler-an-evolution-of-greatness-112112|title=Galloping Gobbler: An evolution of greatness|publisher=Fox Sports|work=Laces Out \u2013 Fox Blog|date=November 21, 2013|accessdate=December 2, 2014}}</ref> striking a [[Heisman Trophy|Heisman-like]] pose.<ref name=\"geek\">{{cite news|url=http://www.sportsgeekery.com/3815/nfl-thanksgiving-day-football-history-and-fun-facts/|title=NFL Thanksgiving Day Football History, Trivia, and Fun Facts|publisher=Sports Geekery|date=November 24, 2014|accessdate=December 2, 2014}}</ref> Much like [[Fox NFL Sunday#Cleatus the Fox Sports Robot|Cleatus]] and [[Fox NASCAR#Criticisms|Digger]], the original Galloping Gobbler trophy reflected Fox's irreverent mascots, and went through several iterations.<ref name=\"Fox-GG\"/> Unimpressed by its tackiness after having won four Turkey Legs in the 1990s, the inaugural winner, [[Emmitt Smith]], famously threw the 2002 award into a trash can.<ref name=\"Fox-GG\"/>\n\nFollowing the [[2004 NFL season|2004 season]], Cris Collinsworth left Fox Sports. After sitting out the [[2005 NFL season|2005 season]], he returned to [[NFL on NBC|NBC Sports]] for the [[2006 NFL season|2006 season]]. For the 2006 season (the first after [[James Brown (sportscaster)|James Brown]] left to return to CBS as host of ''The NFL Today''), Fox experimented with a traveling pre-game show, hosted by Joe Buck from the site of the game to which he was assigned. The halftime and postgame shows were hosted by [[Curt Menefee]]. During Week 14 of the regular season, [[Thom Brennaman]], [[Charles Davis (defensive back)|Charles Davis]] and [[Barry Alvarez]] took over the #4 team for Sam Rosen and [[Tim Ryan (American football, born 1967)|Tim Ryan]].\n\nDuring Weeks 6\u20138 of the [[2006 NFL season|2006 regular season]], [[Dick Stockton]] filled in for Joe Buck, during the MLB playoffs. And during Weeks 6\u20138 of that same regular season, Kenny Albert filled in for Stockton, who was filling in for Buck. During Weeks 6\u20138 of the [[2007 NFL season|2007 regular season]], Kenny Albert filled in for Buck, during the MLB playoffs. During Week 6 and 7 of the 2007 regular season, [[Matt Vasgersian]] filled in for Albert, who was filling in for Buck. During Week 7 of the 2007 regular season, [[Matt Devlin (sportscaster)|Matt Devlin]] filled in for Vasgersian, who was filling in Albert. And during Week 8 of the 2007 regular season, Thom Brennaman filled in for Albert, who was filling in for Buck.\n\nNovember 8, [[2009 NFL season|2009]] (Week 9) featured a special two-hour pregame show originating in [[Afghanistan]]. The regular ''Fox NFL Sunday crew'' hosted the pregame show; [[Chris Rose]] served as studio host and anchored in-game highlights. [[John Lynch (American football)|John Lynch]] and [[Trent Green]] served as studio analysts for the halftime and postgame reports.\n\n=====2010s=====\n[[2010 NFL season|2010]] was Chris Rose's final season calling NFL games for Fox until he departed for [[MLB Network]]. Rose was a part of the eighth-tier team with [[Ross Tucker]]. During Week 5 of the regular season, [[Chris Myers]] filled in for Dick Stockton, who was calling MLB playoffs for [[Major League Baseball on TBS|TBS]]. Myers also filled in for in for Rose during Weeks 11 and 13 of the regular season. At this point, Joe Buck, Troy Aikman, and [[Pam Oliver]] became Fox's longest-tenured broadcast team, surpassing the team of Pat Summerall and John Madden. During Weeks 6-8 of the regular season, Thom Brennaman filled in for Buck during the MLB playoffs. During Weeks 15-17 of the regular season Charles Davis filled in for [[Jim L. Mora|Jim Mora]], who accepted the head coaching job at [[UCLA Bruins football|UCLA Bruins]] in [[2012 UCLA Bruins football team|2012]].\n\nDuring Week 6 of the [[2012 NFL season|2012 regular season]], Thom Brennaman was set to call the [[2012 New York Giants season|New York Giants]] vs. [[2012 San Francisco 49ers season|San Francisco 49ers]] football game instead of Joe Buck, who was scheduled to call the [[2012 National League Championship Series|National League Championship Series]]. Sam Rosen was scheduled to fill in for Thom Brennaman while Brennaman filled in for Buck. However, [[Fox Sports (United States)|Fox Sports]] president Eric Shanks brought up the idea of a two sport, same-day [[Doubleheader (television)|doubleheader]] if both [[2012 San Francisco Giants season|San Francisco]] and [[2012 St. Louis Cardinals season|St. Louis]] won their divisional series. When St. Louis beat [[2012 Washington Nationals season|Washington]] on Friday night, Buck went to San Francisco instead of [[Washington, D.C.]] and called both the 49ers football game and the Giants baseball game.\n\nFox did not send its #2 team of Kenny Albert, Daryl Johnston, and [[Tony Siragusa]] to cover the [[2012\u201313 NFL playoffs#Divisional playoffs|playoffs in 2012]], marking the first time since Fox acquired NFL rights that they did this. Instead the #3 team of Thom Brennaman and [[Brian Billick]] were in the booth for the Divisional Playoffs, as they called the [[2012 Seattle Seahawks season|Seattle Seahawks]] at [[2012 Atlanta Falcons season|Atlanta Falcons]] match-up. Chris Myers joined the Brennaman/Billick/Laura Okmin crew during the NFC Playoffs.\n\nAfter the 2012 season, [[Ron Pitts]] left Fox Sports after being part of the NFL broadcast team for 18 years and joined ''[[Celebrity Page|OK!TV]]''. [[Kevin Burkhardt]] replaced him. The [[2013 NFL season|following year]], Burkhardt, John Lynch, and Pam Oliver and Chris Myers called the [[2013\u201314 NFL playoffs#Divisional Playoffs|Divisional Playoff game]] between the [[2013 New Orleans Saints season|New Orleans Saints]] and the [[2013 Seattle Seahawks season|Seattle Seahawks]]. [[Erin Andrews]] joined Pam Oliver as sideline reporter for Wild Card weekend, NFC Championship, Thanksgiving, and [[Super Bowl XLVIII]].\n\nMeanwhile, [[Brian Billick]] was not offered a contract extension with the ''NFL on Fox'' after his contract expired after the 2013 season. Tim Ryan left Fox after 2013 when he accepted the job as the [[List of San Francisco 49ers broadcasters|San Francisco 49ers]] radio color commentator. And [[Tom McCarthy (sportscaster)|Tom McCarthy]] left Fox after 2013 and joined rival CBS. [[David Diehl]] replaced Billick as Thom Brennaman's analyst, while [[Ronde Barber]] replaced Ryan as Chris Myers' analyst. For Week 7, [[Tim Brando]] replaced [[Mike Goldberg]] after Goldberg performed poorly during a Week 6 game and cursed out his critics on [[Twitter]].\n\nDuring Weeks 6\u20138 of the 2013 season, Thom Brennaman filled in for Joe Buck, Sam Rosen filled in for Kevin Burkhardt, and [[Charissa Thompson]] filled in for Erin Andrews; Joe Buck, Kevin Burkhardt, and Erin Andrews were all on ''Fox Major League Baseball'' playoff duty. Meanwhile, [[Justin Kutcher]] filled in for Thom Brennaman. During Week 13 of the 2013 season, Dick Stockton, [[Brady Quinn]], and Kristina Pink were assigned [[Fox College Football|college football]] responsibilities, leading to a makeshift #6 team. As the rotational broadcaster Brennaman was moved down to fill in for Stockton. He was joined by [[Donovan McNabb]] and Charissa Thompson. Kutcher once again filled in for Brennaman. In Week 15, Kutcher again filled in for Brennaman because this time, Brennaman had voice problems.\n\nIn [[2015 NFL season|2015]], Charles Davis replaces David Diehl as Thom Brennaman's analyst. Meanwhile, Sam Rosen replaced Mike Goldberg and Tim Brando on the #7 team. Kirk Morrison moved down to the #7 team and was joined by [[Chris Cooley]] and [[Matt Millen]] as rotating analysts. Laura Okmin and Tony Siragusa swapped broadcast teams as sideline reporters/analysts, joining the #3 and #4 teams, respectively. Holly Sonders joined the #3 and #5 team as a rotating sideline reporter. [[Danielle Trotta]] joined [[Peter Schrager]] as a rotating reporter for the #7 broadcast team. Brady Quinn moved down to the #8 team, where he was joined by his CFB broadcast partner [[Joe Davis (sportscaster)|Joe Davis]]. On September 27, 2015, [[Richard Deitsch]] of [[Sports Illustrated|SI.com]] reported that, \"in an effort to get Holly Sonders reps as an NFL sideline reporter\", Fox Sports management pulled various assignments they had originally given Laura Okmin and Jennifer Hale on the #3 and #5 teams, respectively, and reassigned them to Sonders. The 2015 season marked Tony Siragusa's final season with Fox.\n\nDuring Weeks 5\u20138 of the 2015 season, Sam Rosen filled in for Kevin Burkhardt while Burkhardt worked the studio shows for Fox's MLB Playoff coverage. During Week 5, Justin Kutcher filled in for Kenny Albert while Albert worked the [[2015 American League Division Series|American League Division Series]] between [[2015 Texas Rangers season|Texas]] and [[2015 Toronto Blue Jays season|Toronto]]. During Weeks 6 and 8 Thom Brennaman filled in for Joe Buck, Kutcher filled in for Thom Brennaman, and Peter Schrager filled in for Erin Andrews during the MLB Playoffs.\n\nDuring Week 5 of the [[2016 NFL season|2016 season]], Kenny Albert had been scheduled to work the [[2016 Los Angeles Dodgers season|Los Angeles]]-[[2016 Washington Redskins season|Washington]] [[2016 National League Division Series|National League Division Series]] series and the [[2016 Washington Redskins season|Redskins]]-[[2016 Baltimore Ravens season|Ravens]] game. Both events occurred 40 miles apart from Friday to Sunday. Rain postponed the Game 2 of the NLDS to Sunday and Fox kept Albert on baseball coverage, with Sam Rosen taking his place alongside Daryl Johnston. Sam Rosen remained with Daryl Johnston in Weeks 6\u20138, while Kenny Albert was elevated to the #2 team with John Lynch. The 2016 season was John Lynch's last with Fox as he leave to become the general manager of the [[San Francisco 49ers]]. During Week 8, [[Matt \"Money\" Smith|Matt Smith]] filled in for Sam Rosen on #7 broadcast team during the MLB Playoffs. Rosen was with the #2 team in [[NFL International Series|London]], filling in for Kevin Burkhardt. During Weeks 6\u20138, Thom Brennaman filled in for Joe Buck while the latter called the [[2016 National League Championship Series|NLCS]] and [[2016 World Series|World Series]]. Justin Kutcher took Brennaman's place on the #4 announcing crew.\n\nDuring Weeks 5\u20138 of the [[2017 NFL season|2017 season]], Kenny Albert filled in for Kevin Burkhardt while Burkhardt worked the studio shows for Fox's MLB Playoff coverage. During Weeks 5\u20138, Sam Rosen filled in for Kenny Albert while he was with the #2 team. During Weeks 6\u20138, Thom Brennaman, for the 9th straight year, filled in for Joe Buck while the latter called the [[2017 American League Championship Series|ALCS]] and [[2017 World Series|World Series]]. Either [[Dan Hellie]] or Justin Kutcher took Thom Brennaman's place on the #4 announcing crew. Originally, [[Jay Cutler]] was slated to join Kevin Burkhardt and Charles Davis. Cutler ended up coming out of retirement for 2017, signing with the [[2017 Miami Dolphins season|Miami Dolphins]] due to the injury of [[Ryan Tannehill]].\n\nAlso in 2017, Ronde Barber and Daryl Johnston switched broadcast teams; Barber joined Kenny Albert and Johnston joined Chris Myers. [[Chris Spielman]] became Thom Brennaman's permanent broadcast partner. However, he became Dan Hellie's temporary partner for Weeks 6 and 7 and Justin Kutcher's temporary partner for Week 8. David Diehl became Sam Rosen's permanent partner except for Week 14 when Brady Quinn joined Rosen and for Week 17 when Matt Millen joined him. [[Greg Jennings]] became Tim Brando's temporary partner for the [[2017 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|Buccaneers]]-[[2017 Green Bay Packers season|Packers]] game on Week 13. Meanwhile, [[Mark Schlereth]] joined Fox Sports this year and became Dick Stockton's broadcast partner.\n[[Mike Pereira]], who previously served as offsite rules analyst, moved to an on-site role with the lead broadcast team for select games. [[Dean Blandino]], who recently resigned from his title as VP of Officiating earlier in the year, replaced Pereira as rules analyst when Pereira was on those select games.\n\nDuring Week 8 of the [[2018 NFL season|2018 season]], for the first time, Thom Brennaman filled in for Kenny Albert as the number 3 team while Joe Buck did the [[2018 World Series|World Series]] from [[Dodger Stadium]], 5 miles away. Buck remained on ''[[Thursday Night Football]]'', going to [[Houston]] on the World Series' travel day from [[Boston]] to [[Los Angeles]], but he waived the opportunity for a same-day, two-sport doubleheader on Sunday over concerns about getting from one venue to the other in [[Transportation in Los Angeles|L.A.]] [[Traffic congestion|traffic]]. With Kristina Pink moving to a co-sideline reporter for ''Thursday Night Football'', the #3 team of Kenny Albert/Ronde Barber had rotating sideline reporters throughout the season.\n\n===Post-game show: ''The OT''===\nBeginning in [[2005 NFL season|2005]], Fox's post-game show was expanded to an hour-long slot (regularly scheduled at 7:30&nbsp;p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Time]]) and branded as ''The OT'' (a possibly intentional nod to the title of the Fox drama series ''[[The O.C.]]''), competing against NBC's primetime pregame ''[[Football Night in America]]''. The program, in addition to providing analysis of the day's NFL games, sends viewers to the remaining ongoing regional games after their main game ends (or meets the NFL's rules regarding a switch to a more compelling matchup, outside of home markets) until the end of the last game.\n\nFox had previously scheduled first-run sitcoms, the comedic video series ''[[The World's Funniest!]]'', and animated series in the 7:00&nbsp;p.m. hour during the NFL season, but these were often subjected to pre-emption (resulting in episodes being delayed by one week or more) due to overruns of late afternoon games into the hour, which impacted their ratings performance; as a result of the postgame show's expansion, the network generally delayed carriage of first-run programming during the first hour of Sunday prime time to midseason (one exception was the freshman sitcom ''[[Mulaney]]'' in 2014, which was pushed to the hour that November due to struggling ratings in its original 9:30 Eastern slot), primarily limited to [[burned off|burn-offs]] of already failed series.\n\n===Changes for 2006===\nAfter the [[2005 NFL season|2005]] season, James Brown left Fox to return to [[CBS Sports]], where he would become the host of the CBS network's NFL pregame show ''The NFL Today''. On August 16, [[2006 NFL season|2006]], after weeks of speculation, the network officially announced that [[Joe Buck]] would take over the role as host vacated by Brown. The move also resulted in the show switching from being broadcast from a permanent Los Angeles studio to a portable studio configuration, similar to the pregame show for ''[[NASCAR on Fox]]'', in which analysts [[Terry Bradshaw]], [[Howie Long]] and [[Jimmy Johnson (American football coach)|Jimmy Johnson]] joined Buck at the stadium site to which Buck is assigned as [[play-by-play]] announcer for one of that week's telecasts. [[Curt Menefee]] worked all halftime shows and all postgame shows on Sundays when no doubleheader was scheduled, also from the same game site with the same analysts. Menefee hosted ''Fox NFL Sunday'' during the several weeks in October when Buck was not available; during that time, Buck called [[Major League Baseball on Fox|Major League Baseball]] postseason games, including the [[World Series]]. The pregame shows on October 15, 22 and 29 were broadcast from the Los Angeles studios; the show returned to the road on November 5.\n\nIt was also announced that weather reporter Jillian Barberie (now [[Jillian Reynolds (TV personality)|Jillian Reynolds]]) would not return for the coming season, as Barberie wished to stay at home in Los Angeles with her family.<ref>{{cite news|title=PGA on the web: Something for office workers|url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/columnist/hiestand-tv/2006-08-16-hiestand-pga_x.htm|author=Michael Hiestand|work=[[USA Today]]|date=August 16, 2006|accessdate=2009-07-31}}</ref> Barberie did participate in at least one of the studio shows. During the 2006 season, [[Chris Rose]] provided [[voice-over|narrated]] updates highlighting other NFL games during the Fox broadcasts from the Los Angeles studio.\n\nOn November 17, [[2006 NFL season|2006]], a source told the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' that the final two pregame shows of the [[2006 NFL season|2006 season]] would take place in the Los Angeles studios, with Buck hosting and [[Dick Stockton]] taking Buck's place on play-by-play duties at the games alongside [[Troy Aikman]]. The source cited that declining [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]] no longer justified its high production costs, including [[security]] [[expenses]]. A Fox spokesman would only say that changes were being considered.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\n====Changes for 2007====\nAfter the 2006 NFL season, ''Fox NFL Sunday'' returned to the Los Angeles studio throughout the entire 2007 regular season and for the two weeks of that year's postseason.  Curt Menefee became the full-time host of the pregame show, while Joe Buck reverted to strictly handling play-by-play duties.\n\n===2010 Monday night special===\nFox presented a limited Monday night game between the [[2010 New York Giants season|New York Giants]] and [[2010 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota Vikings]] on December 13, [[2010 NFL season|2010]]. The game had been originally scheduled to be played on the afternoon on December 12, but due to the collapse of the roof of the [[Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome|Metrodome]] early that morning due to weight from heavy snowpack, the game was moved on short notice to [[Ford Field]] in [[Detroit]] as that facility already had their full television setup still in place after a [[2010 Green Bay Packers season|Packers]]\u2013[[2010 Detroit Lions season|Lions]] game. Fox Sports had kept their cameras on in the Metrodome overnight the night before the originally scheduled game day and captured the stadium roof collapse in full detail; the video of the early morning collapse, captured at multiple angles, aired on that day's edition of ''Fox NFL Sunday'' and quickly went [[viral video|viral]].\n\nThe game was only made available on the main Fox stations in the New York and [[Minneapolis\u2013Saint Paul|Twin Cities]] media markets; owned-and-operated station [[WNYW]] and affiliate [[WXXA-TV]] aired the game in the New York City and [[Albany, New York|Albany]] television markets, while [[Minneapolis]]\u2013[[St. Paul, Minnesota|St. Paul]] owned-and-operated station [[KMSP-TV]], and affiliates [[KXLT-TV]] in [[Rochester, Minnesota|Rochester]] and [[KQDS-TV]] in [[Duluth, Minnesota]] carried the game for the Vikings' markets. The game was also carried on satellite provider [[DirecTV]] through its [[NFL Sunday Ticket]] package.\n\nCoincidentally, this was the first game since [[1992 NFL season|1992]] that [[Brett Favre]] did not start an NFL game, as he was placed on the inactive list due to a shoulder injury, ending his streak of 297 consecutive regular season games; [[Tarvaris Jackson]] started in his place and subsequently [[Joe Webb]] had his first ever down in an NFL game. In addition, it was the first ever regular-season Monday night game in Ford Field.\n\nThis was the first time that either CBS or Fox produced a Monday night game that would only be broadcast in the markets of the competing teams; a similar situation would later happen on November 24, 2014, when CBS televised a Monday night game between the [[New York Jets]] and the [[Buffalo Bills]] that was relocated from [[Ralph Wilson Stadium]] to Ford Field due to a [[November 2014 North American blizzard|major lake-effect snowstorm]] that affected [[Western New York]].\n\n===Long term contract extension, ''Thursday Night Football'' (2018\u20132022)===\nOn December 14, 2011, the NFL, along with Fox, [[NBC Sunday Night Football|NBC]] and [[NFL on CBS|CBS]], and [[Monday Night Football|ESPN]] announced that the league had extended rights deal with all three networks through the 2022 season. The three-network rights deal includes the continued yearly rotation of the Super Bowl between Fox, NBC and CBS, meaning that Fox would air Super Bowls [[Super Bowl XLVIII|XLVIII]] (2014), [[Super Bowl LI|LI]] (2017), [[Super Bowl LIV|LIV]] (2020), and [[Super Bowl LVII|LVII]] (2023).<ref>{{cite news|title=NFL extends broadcast agreements through 2022, generating billions|url=http://blog.chron.com/ultimatetexans/2011/12/nfl-extends-broadcast-agreements-through-2022-generating-billions/|author=David Barron|work=[[Houston Chronicle]]|date=December 14, 2011|accessdate=December 19, 2011}}</ref> The contract included a new \"cross-flexing\" policy introduced in [[2014 NFL season|2014]], under which a limited number of all-AFC games normally assigned to CBS may now be moved to Fox, and vice versa with NFC games.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/entertainment/tv/z-on-tv-blog/bs-sp-zontv-ravens-column-0907-20140904-story.html|title=Big changes in store for CBS' NFL coverage this season|last=Zurawik|first=David|work=Baltimore Sun|access-date=2018-01-31|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\nOn January 31, 2018, the NFL announced that Fox had acquired the broadcast television rights to the ''[[Thursday Night Football]]'' package from 2018 through 2022.

The music was partially inspired by the opening theme of [[Tim Burton]]'s 1989 ''[[Batman (1989 film)|Batman]]'' film; Fox Sports president David Hill had heard the theme while waiting in line for a ''[[Batman]]'' ride at an amusement park in California, and suggested to creative director George Greenberg (who had recently defected to Fox from [[ESPN on ABC|ABC Sports]]) in a phone call that the overlying theme for Fox's NFL theme music should be \"Batman plays football\". Greenberg would enlist Schreer to compose the theme, describing Hill's request as sounding like \"''Batman'' on steroids\". Schreer and his team pitched three separate songs to Greenberg and Hill, who then spliced them together into one for the final version.<ref name=deadspin-howwasborn>{{cite web|title=Batman On Steroids: How The NFL On Fox Theme Song Was Born|url=http://deadspin.com/batman-on-steroids-how-the-nfl-on-fox-theme-song-was-b-1481367234|work=[[Deadspin]]|accessdate=February 5, 2014}}</ref>\n\nBeginning at the [[2010 National League Championship Series]], the ''NFL on Fox'' theme became the official theme music for all Fox Sports broadcasts, regardless of sport. In particular, current Fox Sports president Eric Shanks believed that the special theme music it had previously used for post-season baseball was not upbeat enough, and that the change would \"[give] all of our sports sort of that marquee feel and it gives us a more upbeat way to come on the air.\" The change also resulted in the removal of the long-time ''[[Major League Baseball on Fox]]'' theme (also composed by Schreer).<ref name=deadspin-howwasborn/><ref name=aolnews-bullpen>{{cite web|title=FOX Goes to Musical Bullpen for MLB Playoffs |url=http://www.aolnews.com/2010/10/26/fox-goes-to-musical-bullpen-for-mlb-playoffs/ |work=AOL News |accessdate=February 5, 2014 |archiveurl=https://archive.today/20120723044951/http://www.aolnews.com/2010/10/26/fox-goes-to-musical-bullpen-for-mlb-playoffs/ |archivedate=July 23, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> In 2018-2019 ''[[Fox College Hoops]]'' started to use ''[[Roundball Rock]]'' (the [[John Tesh]] composition that is best known as the ''[[NBA on NBC]]'' theme from 1990 to 2002) for games on the FOX network, after previously sharing the CFB on FOX theme for [[Fox College Football|college football broadcasts]], which still use the latter theme.<ref>{{cite news|last=Curtis|first=Charles|title=Fox Sports is bringing John Tesh's iconic 'Roundball Rock' back to basketball broadcasts|url=https://ftw.usatoday.com/2018/12/fox-sports-roundball-rock-nba-on-nbc-theme-john-tesh-video|publisher=[[Gannett Company]]|newspaper=[[USA Today]]|language=en|date=December 7, 2018|access-date=March 11, 2019}}</ref>\n\nAs of September 27, 2018 starting with Fox's first ''Thursday Night Football'' broadcast, the ''NFL on Fox'' theme music is used on ''TNF'' games aired on Fox and NFL Network, mainly for the pregame and halftime studio show.\n\nSchreer's music for ''NFL on Fox'' was also used for the [[NFL on Sky Sports|NFL coverage]] on [[Sky Sports]] between 2013 and 2018.\n\n===In-game music===\nIn December [[2010 NFL season|2010]], Fox experimented with using an in-game soundtrack during a regional game between the [[2010 Arizona Cardinals season|Arizona Cardinals]] and [[2010 Carolina Panthers season|Carolina Panthers]]. The following week on December 16, Fox publicly announced that it would also feature it during a game on December 20 between the [[2010 San Francisco 49ers season|San Francisco 49ers]] and [[2010 Seattle Seahawks season|Seattle Seahawks]]. Fox Sports president Eric Shanks revealed that ''[[CSI: Miami]]'' composer [[Jeff Cardoni]] had contributed music for the experiment, and saw potential in the concept, explaining that \"just like music in movies, you have to use it at the right times. And imagine trying to score a movie the first time you're seeing it.\" The concept was met with mixed reaction; sports blogger [[Michael David Smith]] believed that the music was \"goofy\", distracting and added nothing to the game.<ref name=usatoday-ingamemusic>{{cite web|title=Coming soon to Fox NFL games: maestro?|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/columnist/hiestand-tv/2010-12-16-nfl-music-soundtrack_N.htm|work=USA Today|date=December 16, 2010|accessdate=February 5, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Musical soundtracks coming to NFL broadcasts|url=http://profootballtalk.nbcsports.com/2010/12/18/musical-soundtracks-coming-to-nfl-broadcasts/|author=Michael David Smith|work=ProFootballTalk|publisher=[[NBC Sports]]|date=December 18, 2010|accessdate=December 15, 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Digital on-screen graphics==\n{{main|FoxBox (sports)}}\nWhen its NFL telecasts debuted in the [[1994 NFL season|1994 season]], Fox's coverage featured the first \"[[Digital on-screen graphic|scoring bug]].\"<ref>{{cite web|title=The evolution of the NFL on Fox score bug|url=http://awfulannouncing.com/2014/the-evolution-of-the-nfl-on-fox-score-bug.html|author=Ben Koo|website=Awful Announcing|date=August 18, 2014}}</ref> Originally appearing as a transparent white half-capsule-shaped graphic in the upper left corner of the screen, it displayed the score and game clock throughout the entire telecast, a first for an NFL television broadcast.\n\n===1996\u20132000===\n[[File:NFL on Fox logo from 1998\u20132000.png|thumb|200px|''NFL on Fox'' logo used from [[1998 NFL season|1998]] to [[2002 NFL season|2002]].]]\nBy [[1996 NFL season|1996]], the graphic changed to a full-statistics panel, where down and distance, penalty, and key in-game statistics would pop in and out when necessary. The basic design of the scoring bug, which was named the \"FoxBox\", mimicked the version used on Fox's MLB coverage. For Fox's coverage of [[Super Bowl XXXIII]] at the end of the [[1998 NFL season|1998 season]], the starting lineups were shown using a virtual television. To television viewers, the effect appeared as if the end zone opened up and a giant television screen rose from the ground. The virtual television display showed video announcing the starting lineups. The virtual television effect was provided by [[PVI Virtual Media Services]] using its L-VIS virtual graphics system.\n\n===2001\u20132002===\nFor the [[2001 NFL season|2001 season]], NFL telecasts began using the same graphics that were previously introduced on Fox's NASCAR and Major League Baseball coverage.  The graphics package was an updated version of the 1998 design, but the FoxBox changed from a compact bug to a banner spanning the top of the screen, and included a scrolling graphic displaying real-time scores of other games in progress. A simple black rectangle with a shaded translucent area spanned the top of the screen from left to right, displaying the abbreviations of both teams in white. The scores were shown in white boxes next to the team. The center showed the game clock in white, to its right was the quarter (\"1st QTR\", \"2nd QTR\", etc.), and to the right of the quarter was the play clock; the ''NFL on Fox'' logo was on the far right. First seen during [[Super Bowl XXXVI]] and used full-time for the [[2002 NFL season|2002]] season, the white scoring boxes were re-colored to yellow. This was also the last year that the score graphic used an effect in which a team's initials flashed in its two primary colors accompanied by percussive sound beats when that team scored (for example, when the [[2002 Green Bay Packers season|Green Bay Packers]] scored a touchdown during a Fox telecast, the \"GB\" initials and box would flash in green and gold for a few seconds as the six points for the TD were added, then again with the extra point). This banner was used for ''Major League Baseball on Fox'' broadcasts through most of the 2004 season.\n\n===2003\u20132005===\n[[File:NFL-on-FOX-2003.png|thumb|200px|''NFL on Fox'' logo used from [[2003 NFL season|2003]] to [[2005 NFL season|2005]].]]\nFor the [[2003 NFL season|2003 season]], Fox's NFL coverage debuted a new graphics package.\n\nInstead of being a large black rectangle consistently, the score banner alternated between a large black rectangle and several small, black parallelograms, and the shaded area above it was removed.  Team logos were now used, in place of their abbreviations.  During the [[2003 NFL playoffs]] however, the logos were removed and the team abbreviations were rendered again in white lettering in the team's main color.\n\nThe banner returned to a large black rectangle at the start of the [[2004 NFL season|2004 season]].  The team logos returned, this time looking more \"three-dimensional\" in appearance and with their respective abbreviations beside the logos.  Electronic eggcrate in the team's primary color was used whenever that certain team calls timeout, scores a touchdown, or a field goal. It would be shown in red whenever the team challenges a play. In addition during a touchdown or field goal, the right side of the banner would have a split flashing \"light\", then the words \"TOUCHDOWN or FIELD GOAL (team)\" in the same electronic lettering scrolling left.\n\nMidway through [[2004 NFL season|2004]], the team logos were once again replaced with the abbreviations. First seen on the [[Major League Baseball on Fox|network's Major League Baseball]] postseason broadcasts that year, this time, they were rendered in electronic eggcrate lettering in the team's main color. When team-specific information was displayed in the banner, such as the [[wikt:hang time|hang time]] of a punt or a touchdown, the abbreviation would revert to the team's logo. During the 2005 holiday season, for the Week 15 Saturday game (between the [[2005 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] and [[2005 New England Patriots season|New England Patriots]]), a new white banner, resembling a chrome finish (first introduced at the start of Fox's coverage of the [[2005 World Series]]) debuted, with animated snow accumulating on top with an animated snowplow periodically clearing the snow from the screen. The following week, the new banner was adopted for all games, however without the snow animation. The team abbreviations became white letters against the team's main color. This banner was used for ''Major League Baseball on Fox'' broadcasts through the [[2007 Major League Baseball season|2007 season]].\n\n===2006\u20132009===\n[[File:Nfl on fox.png|thumb|200px|''NFL on Fox'' logo used from [[2006 NFL season|2006]] to [[2013 NFL season|2013]].]]\nFox Sports again unveiled a new graphics package for its NFL coverage at the start of the [[2006 NFL season|2006 season]].  The score banner began featuring the real-time scores as a permanent fixture on the extreme right side, while the coloring of the banner changes to the colors of the team currently possessing the ball. During playoff games and games featured on days other than the network's traditional game broadcast days or holidays (such as the [[NFL on Thanksgiving Day|Thanksgiving Day]] AFC/NFC game), the scoring bar instead shows either the NFL Thanksgiving logo, the NFL Divisional Playoffs/NFC Championship logo, or a special banner with a message from Fox Sports observing whichever holiday falls during that week (for instance, [[confetti]] and a party horn with a traditional ''[[New Year's Day|Happy New Year]]'' message).\n\n[[File:NFL on FOX.png|thumb|200px|Alternate ''NFL on Fox'' logo used from 2003 to [[2013 NFL season|2013]].]]\nAt the beginning of the 2006 season, a virtual on-field graphic showing an arrow pointing towards the direction of advancement and the down/yardage information began to be used on all plays. This feature was then added by [[NFL on CBS|CBS]], [[NBC Sunday Night Football|NBC]], [[NFL Network]] (for its ''[[Run to the Playoffs]]'' game telecasts) and (beginning with the [[2008 NFL season|2008 season]]) [[Monday Night Football|ESPN]]. At the same time, the down/yardage information is also displayed on the scoring banner, resulting in duplicate presentation of the same information. The bar was also enhanced for [[High-definition television|high definition]] and is thinner than previous versions, with little translucency. The ''NFL on Fox'' logo was also repositioned to the far left instead of the far right. During high definition broadcasts, the area above the banner features a translucent slanting pattern going from left-to-right across the screen. During the 2006 preseason telecasts, the quarter was indicated by four illuminating buttons (the number of buttons that were lit indicated the quarter being played), but due to difficulties in visibility, the quarter returned to being numerically represented for the regular season. On the rare occasion during a game in which the field lines are not visible (such as those dealing with snow or rain), a small bug pops up on the bottom left side of the screen with the logo of the team that is currently in possession as well as text indicating where the ball is (e.g., Arizona-Own 41 Yard Line).\n\nBeginning on November 15, 2009 (Week 11 of the [[2009 NFL season|2009 season]]), scores from other ongoing NFL games that appear on the right side of the banner would have an arrow indicating which team was in possession of the ball; a red arrow indicated that the team is at the [[Red zone (gridiron football)|red zone]]. Fox's NFL telecasts were the only major telecasts of the league's games to not feature timeout indicators until the [[2010 NFL season|2010 season]], save for the number of timeouts that each team has on the right side of the banner.\n\n====December 31, 2006 San Francisco/Denver game====\nThere was one exception to this package for the 2006 season, as Fox had to revert to the then-current scoring banner and graphics package used by [[Fox Sports Networks|Fox Sports Net]] (and formerly the main one used by Fox Sports) for its final regular season game of the year, the [[2006 San Francisco 49ers season|San Francisco 49ers]] vs. the [[2006 Denver Broncos season|Denver Broncos]] on December 31, [[2006 NFL season|2006]], due to a [[Global storm activity of 2006#December 28 \u2013 January 1|blizzard (the second to occur in the span of a week)]] hitting [[Denver]], preventing the usual amount of equipment for Fox's NFL coverage to arrive before the game. [[FSN Rocky Mountain]] (the FSN network that served the Denver market at the time, since replaced by [[AT&T SportsNet Rocky Mountain]]) assisted in the production of the game on short notice by providing the graphical production and other production services. In addition, the \"[[1st & Ten (graphics system)|1st & Ten]]\" graphic lines denoting the [[line of scrimmage]] and [[Down (football)|first down line]] were unavailable for this broadcast. This graphic was also used in Week 5 of the 2007 season in a game between the [[2007 Arizona Cardinals season|Arizona Cardinals]] and [[2007 St. Louis Rams season|St. Louis Rams]].\n\n===2010\u20132013===\nA new graphics package for Fox's NFL telecasts debuted during an August 19, [[2010 NFL season|2010]] pre-season game, as the network began to broadcast its sports programming with graphics optimized for 16:9 displays rather than the [[4:3]] [[safe area (television)|safe area]], resulting in the network asking cable and satellite providers to comply and use the #10 [[Active Format Description]] code to send out over Fox programming, which displays 16:9 content in a [[letterboxing (filming)|letterboxed]] format on 4:3 screens (largely on the analog affiliate feed carried by the provider), in concert with [[Fox News Channel]] and its related news productions for the Fox network also switching to full widescreen presentation. This was promoted during that first game by the Fox broadcast team as giving a \"widescreen viewing experience\" to [[standard-definition television|standard definition]] viewers, using the usual examples of more video information on the screen to demonstrate the new presentation (such as two cheerleaders off to the side displayed in a widescreen shot, but cut out of a 4:3 shot).<ref>{{cite news|title=Fox Sports taking a wider view of football|url=http://www.jsonline.com/sports/102116644.html|newspaper=[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]]|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100905012943/http://www.jsonline.com/sports/102116644.html|archivedate=2010-09-05}}</ref>\n\nThe graphics package is an upgraded version of the 2006 design with a \"much more colorful 3D look\", implemented using a new infrastructure using products developed by [[Vizrt]], which was also rolled out to other Fox Sports networks in subsequent months.<ref>{{cite web|title=Fox Sports moves from Chyron to Vizrt|url=http://www.newscaststudio.com/blog/2010/08/25/fox-sports-moves-from-chyron-to-vizrt/|publisher=NewscastStudio|date=August 25, 2010|accessdate=August 17, 2012}}</ref> The score banner previously used was replaced by an unconventional FoxBox-styled layout, positioned in the top left corner of the screen, with team logos and scores on either side, lights indicating timeouts on the side rims, with the play clock and quarter positioned in the center. Initially, the [[play clock]] also appeared within the center area with 10 seconds remaining, sliding the time remaining in the quarter upward. However, the play clock indicator was soon moved to the bar sliding out of the bottom to show downage.\n\nDue to issues with some cable providers and Fox affiliates (particularly those carried by [[digital subchannel]]s or [[low-power broadcasting|low-power]] [[analog television|analog]] [[television station]]s) in implementing the AFD #10 widescreen mode, or for other broadcasters that still broadcast with content framed for 4:3 displays instead of defaulting to 16:9 like Fox (such as CBS and NBC, along with [[ESPN]] and [[NFL Network]] until they also switched to 16:9 with letterboxed SD feeds), feeds of Fox's NFL games have been offered with graphics positioned for 4:3 displays instead of 16:9, and in most cases, only one game per week was broadcast with 16:9 graphics.\n\nSmall tweaks were made for the [[2011 NFL season|2011 season]], including the timeout indicators counting upward instead of downward, and the possession indicator now appearing alongside the team that currently is in possession of the ball. Additionally, the scoreboard next to the Fox Sports bug for other ongoing NFL games was replaced by a traditional ticker; the bug was made slightly smaller and rounder as well. Special holiday animations also appeared with the banner package; digitally animated leaves fell on top of the FoxBox on [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]], while falling snow piles on top during the last two weeks of December in observance of the [[Christmas and holiday season]], with the timeout indicators being changed in the latter instance to resemble strings of [[Christmas lights]].\n\nAfter two years of using the unconventional layout, for [[2012 NFL season|2012]], a more traditional FoxBox was introduced; team abbreviations (in the team's primary color) are stacked on the left side of the box, with timeout lights positioned underneath each team abbreviation, and a possession indicator to the left of it. The clock/quarter indicator is on the right side. Down and distance pops out of the bottom, while the timeout/penalty/touchdown animation is the same as in the unconventional design of the previous two seasons. Also for the 2012 season, Fox began providing play-by-play commentary of all games in Spanish on its [[second audio program]] channel. In 2013, in observance of the [[Christmas holiday season|holiday season]], Christmas lights returned to the FoxBox along the sides of the graphic, but they no longer correspond to timeouts. When a team scores, calls a timeout or gets called on a penalty, the lights change from red, green and blue to the corresponding team's color for the duration of the graphic, before returning to the normal colors.\n\n===2014\u20132016===\nFor the [[2014 NFL season|2014 season]], the graphics were changed to match those that had previously been introduced on Fox Sports's Major League Baseball and NASCAR coverage. The graphics package itself is similar to the previous look, however with a more boxy appearance, and the fonts used are rounder and have less of an athletic appearance than previous packages used by Fox. The layout of the score box is essentially a mirror image of the already-introduced MLB graphic, except that the NFL version is on the top-left of the screen, while the baseball version was originally on the bottom-left (it was moved to the bottom-right beginning in 2016). Like the MLB graphic, the box has two components: a main box and a dynamic strip. The main box contains the team abbreviations, stacked on top of the team scores. The possession indicator is a line above the team holding the ball; timeout indicators, which are counting downward, are stacked next to the scores. This unconventional layout of displaying the scores (also used in 2010 and 2011) is only used for NFL coverage; college football and MLB coverage use the traditional layout with the team abbreviations to the left of the scores.\n\nThe dynamic strip normally shows the next down that will occur, such as \"3rd Down\". It changes to show down and distance and the play clock, and turns yellow if a flag is thrown. When a score occurs, the dynamic strip disappears and the main box changes to show the logo of the team scoring, along with the type of score (\"TOUCHDOWN\", \"FIELD GOAL\", \"SAFETY\"). For a penalty, the main box shows the logo of the offending team, while the dynamic strip turns yellow and displays the type of penalty. When a timeout is called, the dynamic strip turns to the color of the team taking the timeout and displays \"Timeout\", while the main box displays the team's logo over a neutral gray background. After a few seconds, the main box returns to the scores and a small gray box with the team logo appears next to the word \"Timeout\" in the dynamic strip.\n\nFor a review or a challenge, the dynamic strip moves from the bottom to the right side of the main box and turns red, displaying whether it is a challenge, an official review, or a scoring review. When the decision is announced, the strip expands to show the result of the review on a yellow background. After a few seconds, the strip shifts back to the bottom of the main box and if a timeout is charged on a lost challenge, the strip shows the team charged with the timeout.\n\nFor regular season games only, beginning with Week 3 of 2016, the record for each team was added to the box, making the team abbreviations of each team smaller.\n\nFox gradually worked elements of a new square-edged graphics package with thinner fonts into secondary situations during the 2016 season. This package (in white instead of black) was used for Fox's Super Bowl LI pregame, halftime, and post game shows, but the game broadcast itself continued to use the 2014 package. However, the translucent shading around the scoreboard was removed for the Super Bowl.\n\n===2017\u20132020===\nStarting on August 27, 2017, after three years of using the unconventional layout from the previous graphics package, a new, traditional score bar was introduced.  The score bug was moved from the top left to across the bottom of the screen and is now horizontal.  Additionally, team names are displayed instead of their abbreviations and the clock is located towards the right of the bug and the down and distance is displayed on the far right.  Also, timeout indicators are shown below the team names and the possession indicator, which was originally shown below the team's score (through Week 4 of the [[2017 NFL season]]), is now shown above the team's score. When showing stats or player info, the score bug briefly moves to the bottom left of the screen then returns to its previous position.  With this, all five of the NFL's broadcast partners (CBS, ESPN, Fox, NBC and NFL Network) now have score bars across the bottom of the screen, with Fox being the last of the five to make the switch.\n\nAs for the graphics package itself, it is an upgraded version of the 2014 design and eventually, it has rolled out on almost all of Fox Sports' properties, including Fox's [[Fox College Football|college football]] and basketball coverage on Fox and FS1, the [[2017 Major League Baseball season|2017 MLB postseason]] and on February 2018, ''[[Fox NASCAR|NASCAR on Fox]]''.\n\nFor NFL playoff games and ''[[Thursday Night Football]]'', which Fox picked up in 2018, the yellow-and-black \"Fox NFL\" logo on-screen and on graphics and transitions is replaced by a blue-and-white \"Fox\" or \"Fox|NFL Network\" logo respectively. In some transitions, it is instead replaced by the full \"TNF presented by Bud Light\" logo. Fox also produces NFL Network exclusives on non-Fox/NBC Thursdays, on some Sunday mornings, and on late-season Saturdays; these games replace the \"Fox NFL\" logo with an NFL Network logo on a black square, the size of the \"Fox NFL\" logo.\n\nFormer [[New England Patriots]] tight end [[Rob Gronkowski]] was hired by [[Fox Sports]] as an analyst for its NFL programming.<ref name=\":9\">{{Cite web|url=https://deadline.com/2019/10/rob-gronkowski-fox-sports-nfl-analystthursday-night-football-pregame-1202755145/|title=Rob Gronkowski Joins Fox Sports As NFL Analyst After Three Super Bowl Wins With Patriots|last=Pedersen|first=Erik|last2=Pedersen|first2=Erik|date=2019-10-08|website=Deadline|language=en|access-date=2019-10-09}}</ref> He debuted on October 10, 2019 for the network's ''NFL Thursday Pregame Show''.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2019/10/08/sport/rob-gronkowski-fox-sports-trnd/index.html|title=Rob Gronkowski is back, but this time as an NFL analyst on FOX Sports|author=Allen Kim|website=CNN|access-date=2019-10-09}}</ref>\n\n===2020\u2013present===\nDuring [[Super Bowl LIV]], Fox introduced a new on-air appearance for its NFL and XFL broadcasts, replacing the previous rectangular appearance with a slanted motif. Some lower thirds incorporated use of fonts based on the teams' respective wordmark logos, and selected players were depicted in these and other graphics using stylized illustrations rather than traditional photos. The scoreboard was also changed to a more box-like appearance, showing only team logos, and with both teams positioned in opposing directions. Translucent strips were used to show quarterback statistics following each play.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sportsvideo.org/2020/02/02/live-from-super-bowl-liv-fox-sports-set-to-debut-new-graphics-look-for-big-game/|title=Live from Super Bowl LIV: Fox Sports Set to Debut New Graphics Look for Big Game|last=Kerschbaumer|first=Ken|website=Sports Video Group|language=en|access-date=February 3, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://awfulannouncing.com/fox/new-super-bowl-graphics-fox-scorebug-font-cartoons.html|title=Fox's new Super Bowl graphics include centered scorebug, italics, cartoons|date=2020-02-03|website=Awful Announcing|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-04}}</ref> The graphics carried over to [[XFL (2020)|XFL]] broadcasts the next week when the league re-launched.\n\n==Nielsen ratings==\n[[File:NFL on Fox booth at Candlestick Park 11-16-08.JPG|thumb|The ''NFL on Fox'' booth at [[Candlestick Park]] during a game on November 16, 2008.

As a result, with the help of Motilal Nehru he started an English daily the \"Leader\" in 1909, where he was Editor 1909\u20131911 and President 1911\u20131919.<ref name=\"maha\"/>\n\nIn 1910, Malaviyaji started the Hindi paper `Maryada'.<ref name=\"maha\"/>\n\nIn 1924, Malaviya along with the help of national leaders [[Lala Lajpat Rai]]  and [[M.

He soon earned huge respect as one of the most brilliant lawyers of the Allahabad High Court. He gave up his legal practice when he was at his pinnacle in 1911 on his 50th birthday so that he could serve the nation thereafter.\n\nAbout his legal career, Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru mentions of him \u2013 ''...a brilliant Civil Lawyer'' and Sir Mirza Ismail said \u2013 ''I have heard a great lawyer say that if Mr.Malaviya had so willed it, he would have been an ornament to the legal profession''.<ref name=bhu>{{cite web|url=http://www.bhu.ac.in/mahamana.htm|title=PANDIT MADAN MOHAN MALAVIYA.

The sessions court had sent to gallows 170 persons for the attack. However, Malaviya defended them in the Allahabad High Court and was able to get 155 persons saved from the gallows. The remaining 15 also were recommended for clemency by the High Court, whereafter their sentences were also commuted from death to life-imprisonment.  During these arguments, the then Chief Justice Honble Sir Grimwood Mears bowed thrice to Malaviya as a Mark of great appreciation for the sheer brilliance of his arguments.{{citation needed|reason=Inconsistent with Chauri Chaura case as detailed in wikipedia itself|date=December 2015}}\n\n==Banaras Hindu University==\nIn April 1911, [[Annie Besant]] met Malaviya and they decided to work for a common Hindu University in Varanasi.

Harrison College's Principal provided a monthly scholarship to Malaviya, whose family had been facing financial hardships, and he was able to complete his B.A. at the [[University of Calcutta]].\n\nAlthough he wanted to pursue an M.A. in Sanskrit, his family conditions did not allow it and his father wanted him to take his family profession of Bhagavat recital, thus in July 1884 Madan Mohan Malaviya started his career as an assistant master at the Govt High School in Allahabad.<ref name=\"indiapost\"/>\n\n==Political career==\n[[File:Mahatma Gandhi with Madan Mohan Malaviya.jpeg|thumb|Malaviya with Gandhi.]]\n\nIn December 1886, Malaviya attended the 2nd [[Indian National Congress]] session in [[Calcutta]] under chairmanship of [[Dadabhai Naoroji]], where he spoke on the issue of representation in Councils.

In order to follow the tradition of [[Sannyasa]] throughout his life, he pursued the avowed commitment to live on the society's support.

R. Ambedkar|Dr. Ambedkar]] (on behalf of the depressed classes among Hindus) and Malaviya (on behalf of the other Hindus). The agreement gave reserved seats for the depressed classes in the Provisional legislatures, within the general electorate and not by creating a separate electorate. Due to the pact, the depressed class received 148 seats in the legislature, instead of the 71 as allocated in the [[Communal Award]]  proposal of the [[United Kingdom|British]] Prime Minister [[Ramsay MacDonald]]. After the pact, the [[Communal Award]] was modified to include the terms as per the pacts.

As a result, with the help of Motilal Nehru he started an English daily the \"Leader\" in 1909, where he was Editor 1909\u20131911 and President 1911\u20131919.<ref name=\"maha\"/>\n\nIn 1910, Malaviyaji started the Hindi paper `Maryada'.<ref name=\"maha\"/>\n\nIn 1924, Malaviya along with the help of national leaders [[Lala Lajpat Rai]]  and [[M.

He soon earned huge respect as one of the most brilliant lawyers of the Allahabad High Court. He gave up his legal practice when he was at his pinnacle in 1911 on his 50th birthday so that he could serve the nation thereafter.\n\nAbout his legal career, Sir Tej Bahadur Sapru mentions of him \u2013 ''...a brilliant Civil Lawyer'' and Sir Mirza Ismail said \u2013 ''I have heard a great lawyer say that if Mr.Malaviya had so willed it, he would have been an ornament to the legal profession''.<ref name=bhu>{{cite web|url=http://www.bhu.ac.in/mahamana.htm|title=PANDIT MADAN MOHAN MALAVIYA.

The sessions court had sent to gallows 170 persons for the attack. However, Malaviya defended them in the Allahabad High Court and was able to get 155 persons saved from the gallows. The remaining 15 also were recommended for clemency by the High Court, whereafter their sentences were also commuted from death to life-imprisonment.  During these arguments, the then Chief Justice Honble Sir Grimwood Mears bowed thrice to Malaviya as a Mark of great appreciation for the sheer brilliance of his arguments.{{citation needed|reason=Inconsistent with Chauri Chaura case as detailed in wikipedia itself|date=December 2015}}\n\n==Banaras Hindu University==\nIn April 1911, [[Annie Besant]] met Malaviya and they decided to work for a common Hindu University in Varanasi.

{"title_page": "Second-order logic", "text_new": "In [[logic]] and [[mathematics]] '''second-order logic''' is an extension of [[first-order logic]], which itself is an extension of [[propositional logic]].<ref>Shapiro (1991) and Hinman (2005) give complete introductions to the subject, with full definitions.</ref> Second-order logic is in turn extended by [[higher-order logic]] and [[type theory]].\n\nFirst-order logic [[Quantification (logic)|quantifies]] only variables that range over individuals (elements of the [[domain of discourse]]); second-order logic, in addition, also quantifies over relations. For example, the second-order sentence <math>\\forall P\\,\\forall x (x \\in P \\lor x \\notin P)</math> says that for every unary relation (or [[Set (mathematics)|set]]) ''P'' of individuals, and every individual ''x'', either ''x'' is in ''P'' or it is not (this is the [[principle of bivalence]]). Second-order logic also includes quantification over sets, functions, and other variables as explained in the section ''[[#Syntax and fragments|Syntax and fragments]]''. Both first-order and second-order logic use the idea of a [[domain of discourse]] (often called simply the \"domain\" or the \"universe\"). The domain is a set over which individual elements may be quantified.\n\n==Syntax and fragments==\n{{anchor|fragments}}\nThe syntax of second-order logic tells which expressions are well formed [[formula (mathematical logic)|formulas]]. In addition to the [[First-order logic#Formation rules|syntax of first-order logic]], second-order logic includes many new '''sorts''' (sometimes called '''types''') of variables. These are:\n* A sort of variables that range over sets of individuals. If ''S'' is a variable of this sort and ''t'' is a first-order term then the expression ''t'' \u2208 ''S'' (also written ''S''(''t''), or ''St'' to save parentheses) is an [[atomic formula]]. Sets of individuals can also be viewed as [[unary relation]]s on the domain.\n* For each natural number ''k'' there is a sort of variables that ranges over all ''k''-ary relations on the individuals. If ''R'' is such a ''k''-ary relation variable and ''t''<sub>1</sub>,...,''t''<sub>''k''</sub> are first-order terms then the expression ''R''(''t''<sub>1</sub>,...,''t''<sub>''k''</sub>) is an atomic formula.\n* For each natural number ''k'' there is a sort of variables that ranges over all functions taking ''k'' elements of the domain and returning a single element of the domain. If ''f'' is such a ''k''-ary function variable and ''t''<sub>1</sub>,...,''t''<sub>''k''</sub> are first-order terms then the expression ''f''(''t''<sub>1</sub>,...,''t''<sub>''k''</sub>) is a first-order term.\nEach of the variables just defined may be universally and/or existentially quantified over, to build up formulas. Thus there are many kinds of quantifiers, two for each sort of variables. A '''sentence''' in second-order logic, as in first-order logic, is a well-formed formula with no free variables (of any sort).\n\nIt's possible to forgo the introduction of function variables in the definition given above (and some authors do this) because an ''n''-ary function variable can be represented by a relation variable of arity ''n''+1 and an appropriate formula for the uniqueness of the \"result\" in the ''n''+1 argument of the relation. (Shapiro 2000, p.&nbsp;63)\n\n'''[[Monadic second-order logic]]''' (MSO) is a restriction of second-order logic in which only quantification over unary relations (i.e. sets) is allowed. Quantification over functions, owing to the equivalence to relations as described above, is thus also not allowed. The second-order logic without these restrictions is sometimes called '''full second-order logic''' to distinguish it from the monadic version. Monadic second-order logic is particularly used in the context of [[Courcelle's theorem]], an algorithmic meta-theorem in [[graph theory]].\n\nJust as in first-order logic, second-order logic may include [[non-logical symbols]] in a particular second-order language. These are restricted, however, in that all terms that they form must be either first-order terms (which can be substituted for a first-order variable) or second-order terms (which can be substituted for a second-order variable of an appropriate sort).\n\nA formula in second-order logic is said to be of first-order (and sometimes denoted <math>\\Sigma^1_0</math> or <math>\\Pi^1_0</math>) if its quantifiers (which may be of either type) range only over variables of first order, although it may have free variables of second order. A <math>\\Sigma^1_1</math> (existential second-order) formula is one additionally having some existential quantifiers over second order variables, i.e. <math>\\exists R_0\\ldots\\exists R_m \\phi</math>, where <math>\\phi</math> is a first-order formula. The fragment of second order logic consisting only of existential second-order formulas is called '''existential second-order logic''' and abbreviated as ESO, as <math>\\Sigma^1_1</math>, or even as \u2203SO. The fragment of <math>\\Pi^1_1</math> formulas is defined dually, it is called universal second-order logic. More expressive fragments are defined for any ''k'' > 0 by mutual recursion: <math>\\Sigma^1_{k+1}</math> has the form <math>\\exists R_0\\ldots\\exists R_m \\phi</math>, where <math>\\phi</math> is a <math>\\Pi^1_k</math> formula, and similar, <math>\\Pi^1_{k+1}</math> has the form <math>\\forall R_0\\ldots\\forall R_m \\phi</math>, where <math>\\phi</math> is a <math>\\Sigma^1_k</math> formula. (See [[analytical hierarchy]] for the analogous construction of [[second-order arithmetic]].)\n\n==Semantics==\nThe semantics of second-order logic establish the meaning of each sentence. Unlike first-order logic, which has only one standard semantics, there are two different semantics that are commonly used for second-order logic: '''standard semantics''' and '''Henkin semantics'''. In each of these semantics, the interpretations of the first-order quantifiers and the logical connectives are the same as in first-order logic. Only the ranges of quantifiers over second-order variables differ in the two types of semantics [[#Vaananen2001|(V\u00e4\u00e4n\u00e4nen 2001)]].\n\nIn standard semantics, also called full semantics, the quantifiers range over ''all'' sets or functions of the appropriate sort. Thus once the domain of the first-order variables is established, the meaning of the remaining quantifiers is fixed. It is these semantics that give second-order logic its expressive power, and they will be assumed for the remainder of this article.\n\nIn Henkin semantics, each sort of second-order variable has a particular domain of its own to range over, which may be a proper subset of all sets or functions of that sort. [[Leon Henkin]] (1950) defined these semantics and proved that [[G\u00f6del's completeness theorem]] and [[compactness theorem]], which hold for first-order logic, carry over to second-order logic with Henkin semantics. This is because Henkin semantics are almost identical to many-sorted first-order semantics, where additional sorts of variables are added to simulate the new variables of second-order logic. Second-order logic with Henkin semantics is not more expressive than first-order logic. Henkin semantics are commonly used in the study of [[second-order arithmetic]].\n\nV\u00e4\u00e4n\u00e4nen [[#Vaananen2001|(2001)]] argued that the choice between Henkin models and full models for second-order logic is analogous to the choice between [[ZFC]] and ''[[Von Neumann universe|V]]'' as a basis for set theory: \"As with second-order logic, we cannot really choose whether we axiomatize mathematics using ''V'' or ZFC. The result is the same in both cases, as ZFC ''is'' the best attempt so far to use ''V'' as an axiomatization of mathematics.\"\n\n==Expressive power==\nSecond-order logic is more expressive than first-order logic. For example, if the domain is the set of all [[real number]]s, one can assert in first-order logic the existence of an additive inverse of each real number by writing \u2200''x'' \u2203''y'' (''x'' + ''y'' = 0) but one needs second-order logic to assert the [[Supremum|least-upper-bound]] property for sets of real numbers, which states that every bounded, nonempty set of real numbers has a [[supremum]]. If the domain is the set of all real numbers, the following second-order sentence (split over two lines) expresses the least upper bound property:\n: (&forall; A) ([{{color|#800000|(&exist; ''w'') (''w'' &isin; A)}} &and; {{color|#008000|(&exist; ''z'')(&forall; ''u'')(''u'' &isin; A &rarr; ''u'' &le; ''z'')}}] \n::&rarr; {{color|#0000BB|(&exist; ''x'')(&forall; ''y'')([(&forall; ''w'')(''w'' &isin; A &rarr; ''w'' &le; ''x'') &and; (&forall; ''u'')(''u'' &isin; A &rarr; ''u'' &le; ''y'')] &rarr; ''x'' &le; ''y'')}})\nThis formula is a direct formalization of \"every {{color|#800000|nonempty}}, {{color|#008000|bounded}} set A {{color|#0000BB|has a least upper bound}}.\" It can be shown that any [[ordered field]] that satisfies this property is isomorphic to the real number field. On the other hand, the set of first-order sentences valid in the reals has arbitrarily large models due to the compactness theorem. Thus the least-upper-bound property cannot be expressed by any set of sentences in first-order logic.  (In fact, every [[real-closed field]] satisfies the same first-order sentences in the signature <math>\\langle +,\\cdot,\\le\\rangle</math> as the real numbers.)\n\nIn second-order logic, it is possible to write formal sentences which say \"the domain is [[finite set|finite]]\" or \"the domain is of [[countable set|countable]] [[cardinality]].\" To say that the domain is finite, use the sentence that says that every [[surjective]] function from the domain to itself is [[injective]]. To say that the domain has countable cardinality, use the sentence that says that there is a [[bijection]] between every two infinite subsets of the domain. It follows from the [[compactness theorem]] and the [[upward L\u00f6wenheim\u2013Skolem theorem]] that it is not possible to characterize finiteness or countability, respectively, in first-order logic.\n\nCertain fragments of second order logic like ESO are also more expressive than first-order logic even though they are strictly less expressive than the full second-order logic. ESO also enjoys translation equivalence with some extensions of first-order logic which allow non-linear ordering of quantifier dependencies, like first-order logic extended with [[Henkin quantifier]]s, [[Hintikka]] and Sandu's [[independence-friendly logic]], and V\u00e4\u00e4n\u00e4nen's [[dependence logic]].\n\n==Deductive systems==\n\nA [[deductive system]] for a logic is a set of [[inference rules]] and logical axioms that determine which sequences of formulas constitute valid proofs. Several deductive systems can be used for second-order logic, although none can be complete for the standard semantics (see below). Each of these systems is [[soundness|sound]], which means any sentence they can be used to prove is logically valid in the appropriate semantics.\n\nThe weakest deductive system that can be used consists of a standard deductive system for first-order logic (such as [[natural deduction]]) augmented with substitution rules for second-order terms.<ref>Such a system is used without comment by Hinman (2005).</ref> This deductive system is commonly used in the study of [[second-order arithmetic]].\n\nThe deductive systems considered by Shapiro (1991) and Henkin (1950) add to the augmented first-order deductive scheme both comprehension axioms and choice axioms. These axioms are sound for standard second-order semantics. They are sound for Henkin semantics restricted to Henkin models satisfying the comprehension and choice axioms.<ref>These are the models originally studied by Henkin (1950).</ref>\n\n==Non-reducibility to first-order logic==\n\nOne might attempt to reduce the second-order theory of the real numbers, with full second-order semantics, to the first-order theory in the following way. First expand the domain from the set of all real numbers to a two-sorted domain, with the second sort containing all ''sets of'' real numbers. Add a new binary predicate to the language: the membership relation. Then sentences that were second-order become first-order, with the formerly second-order quantifiers ranging over the second sort instead. This reduction can be attempted in a one-sorted theory by adding unary predicates that tell whether an element is a number or a set, and taking the domain to be the union of the set of real numbers and the [[power set]] of the real numbers.\n\nBut notice that the domain was asserted to include '''''all''''' sets of real numbers. That requirement cannot be reduced to a first-order sentence, as the [[L\u00f6wenheim\u2013Skolem theorem]] shows. That theorem implies that there is some [[countably infinite]] subset of the real numbers, whose members we will call ''internal numbers'', and some countably infinite collection of sets of internal numbers, whose members we will call \"internal sets\", such that the domain consisting of internal numbers and internal sets satisfies exactly the same first-order sentences as are satisfied by the domain of real numbers and sets of real numbers. In particular, it satisfies a sort of least-upper-bound axiom that says, in effect:\n\n:Every nonempty ''internal'' set that has an ''internal'' upper bound has a least ''internal'' upper bound.\n\nCountability of the set of all internal numbers (in conjunction with the fact that those form a densely ordered set) implies that that set does not satisfy the full least-upper-bound axiom. Countability of the set of all ''internal'' sets implies that it is not the set of ''all'' subsets of the set of all ''internal'' numbers (since [[Cantor's theorem]] implies that the set of all subsets of a countably infinite set is an uncountably infinite set). This construction is closely related to [[Skolem's paradox]].\n\nThus the first-order theory of real numbers and sets of real numbers has many models, some of which are countable. The second-order theory of the real numbers has only one model, however.\nThis follows from the classical theorem that there is only one [[Archimedean property|Archimedean]] [[real number|complete ordered field]], along with the fact that all the axioms of an Archimedean complete ordered field are expressible in second-order logic. This shows that the second-order theory of the real numbers cannot be reduced to a first-order theory, in the sense that the second-order theory of the real numbers has only one model but the corresponding first-order theory has many models.\n\nThere are more extreme examples showing that second-order logic with standard semantics is more expressive than first-order logic. There is a finite second-order theory whose only model is the real numbers if the [[continuum hypothesis]] holds and which has no model if the continuum hypothesis does not hold (cf. Shapiro 2000, p.&nbsp;105). This theory consists of a finite theory characterizing the real numbers as a complete Archimedean ordered field plus an axiom saying that the domain is of the first uncountable cardinality. This example illustrates that the question of whether a sentence in second-order logic is consistent is extremely subtle.\n\nAdditional limitations of second order logic are described in the next section.\n\n==Metalogical results==\nIt is a corollary of [[G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorem]] that there is no deductive system (that is, no notion of ''provability'') for second-order formulas that simultaneously satisfies these three desired attributes:<ref>The proof of this corollary is that a sound, complete, and effective deduction system for standard semantics could be used to produce a [[recursively enumerable]] completion of [[Peano arithmetic]], which G\u00f6del's theorem shows cannot exist.</ref>\n\n* ([[Soundness]]) Every provable second-order sentence is universally valid, i.e., true in all domains under standard semantics.\n* ([[Completeness (logic)|Completeness]]) Every universally valid second-order formula, under standard semantics, is provable.\n* ([[Decidability (logic)|Effectiveness]]) There is a [[automated proof checking|proof-checking]] algorithm that can correctly decide whether a given sequence of symbols is a proof or not.\n\nThis corollary is sometimes expressed by saying that second-order logic does not admit a complete [[proof theory]]. In this respect second-order logic with standard semantics differs from first-order logic; [[W. V. Quine|Quine]] (1970, pp.&nbsp;90&ndash;91) pointed to the lack of a complete proof system as a reason for thinking of second-order logic as not ''logic'', properly speaking.\n\nAs mentioned above, Henkin proved that the standard deductive system for first-order logic is sound, complete, and effective for second-order logic with [[Higher-order logic|Henkin semantics]], and the deductive system with comprehension and choice principles is sound, complete, and effective for Henkin semantics using only models that satisfy these principles.\n\nThe [[compactness theorem]] and the [[L\u00f6wenheim\u2013Skolem theorem]] do not hold for full models of second-order logic. They do hold however for Henkin models. [[#Vaananen2001|(V\u00e4\u00e4n\u00e4nen 2001)]]\n\n==History and disputed value==\n\nPredicate logic was introduced to the mathematical community by [[Charles Sanders Peirce|C. S. Peirce]], who coined the term ''second-order logic'' and whose notation is most similar to the modern form (Putnam 1982). However, today most students of logic are more familiar with the works of [[Gottlob Frege|Frege]], who published his work several years prior to Peirce but whose works remained less known until [[Bertrand Russell]] and [[Alfred North Whitehead]] made them famous.  Frege used different variables to distinguish quantification over objects from quantification over properties and sets; but he did not see himself as doing two different kinds of logic.  After the discovery of [[Russell's paradox]] it was realized that something was wrong with his system.  Eventually logicians found that restricting Frege's logic in various ways\u2014to what is now called [[First-order predicate calculus|first-order logic]]\u2014eliminated this problem: sets and properties cannot be quantified over in first-order-logic alone.  The now-standard hierarchy of orders of logics dates from this time.\n\nIt was found that [[set theory]] could be formulated as an axiomatized system within the apparatus of first-order logic (at the cost of several kinds of [[completeness (logic)|completeness]], but nothing so bad as Russell's paradox), and this was done (see [[Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory]]), as sets are vital for [[mathematics]].  [[Arithmetic]], [[mereology]], and a variety of other powerful logical theories could be formulated axiomatically without appeal to any more logical apparatus than first-order quantification, and this, along with G\u00f6del and Skolem's adherence to first-order logic, led to a general decline in work in second (or any higher) order logic.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}\n\nThis rejection was actively advanced by some logicians, most notably [[W. V. Quine]].  Quine advanced the view{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} that in predicate-language sentences like ''Fx'' the \"''x''\" is to be thought of as a variable or name denoting an object and hence can be quantified over, as in \"For all things, it is the case that . . .\" but the \"''F''\" is to be thought of as an ''abbreviation'' for an incomplete sentence, not the name of an object (not even of an [[abstract object]] like a property).  For example, it might mean \" . . . is a dog.\"  But it makes no sense to think we can quantify over something like this. (Such a position is quite consistent with Frege's own arguments on the [[concept and object|concept-object]] distinction). So to use a predicate as a variable is to have it occupy the place of a name which only individual variables should occupy. This reasoning has been rejected by [[George Boolos]].\n\nIn recent years{{when|date=October 2017}} second-order logic has made something of a recovery, buoyed by Boolos' interpretation of second-order quantification as [[plural quantification]] over the same domain of objects as first-order quantification (Boolos 1984). Boolos furthermore points to the claimed [[nonfirstorderizability]] of sentences such as \"Some critics admire only each other\" and \"Some of Fianchetto's men went into the warehouse unaccompanied by anyone else\", which he argues can only be expressed by the full force of second-order quantification.  However, [[generalized quantifier|generalized quantification]] and partially ordered, or branching, quantification may suffice to express a certain class of purportedly nonfirstorderizable sentences as well and it does not appeal to second-order quantification.\n\n== Relation to computational complexity==\n{{anchor|Applications to complexity|relation to computational complexity}}\n{{main|SO (complexity)}}\nThe expressive power of various forms of second-order logic on finite structures is intimately tied to [[computational complexity theory]]. The field of [[descriptive complexity]] studies which computational [[complexity class]]es can be characterized by the power of the logic needed to express languages (sets of finite strings) in  them. A string ''w''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''w''<sub>1</sub>\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7''w<sub>n</sub>'' in a finite alphabet ''A'' can be represented by a finite structure with domain ''D''&nbsp;=&nbsp;{1,...,''n''}, unary predicates ''P<sub>a</sub>'' for each ''a''&nbsp;\u2208&nbsp;''A'', satisfied by those indices ''i'' such that ''w<sub>i</sub>''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''a'', and additional predicates which serve to uniquely identify which index is which (typically, one takes the graph of the successor function on ''D'' or the order relation <, possibly with other arithmetic predicates). Conversely, the table of any finite structure can be encoded by a finite string.\n\nThis identification leads to the following characterizations of variants of second-order logic over finite structures:\n* REG (the set of [[regular language]]s) is definable by monadic, second-order formulas ([[B\u00fcchi's theorem]], 1960)\n* [[NP (complexity)|NP]] is the set of languages definable by existential, second-order formulas ([[Fagin's theorem]], 1974).\n* [[co-NP]] is the set of languages definable by universal, second-order formulas.\n* [[PH (complexity)|PH]] is the set of languages definable by second-order formulas.\n* [[PSPACE]] is the set of languages definable by second-order formulas with an added [[transitive closure]] operator.\n* [[EXPTIME]] is the set of languages definable by second-order formulas with an added [[least fixed point]] operator.\nRelationships among these classes directly impact the relative expressiveness of the logics over finite structures; for example, if '''PH'''&nbsp;=&nbsp;'''PSPACE''', then adding a transitive closure operator to second-order logic would not make it any more expressive over finite structures.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Philosophy}}\n* [[First-order logic]]\n* [[Higher-order logic]]\n* [[L\u00f6wenheim number]]\n* [[Omega language]]\n* [[Second-order propositional logic]]\n\n==Notes==\n<references/>\n\n==References==\n* {{cite book\n | author=Andrews, Peter\n | year=2002\n | title=An Introduction to Mathematical Logic and Type Theory: To Truth Through Proof\n | edition =2nd\n | publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers}}\n*{{cite journal\n |doi = 10.2307/2026308\n |author = Boolos, George\n |year= 1984\n | title=To Be Is To Be a Value of a Variable (or to Be Some Values of Some Variables)\n | journal=Journal of Philosophy\n | volume=81\n |issue = 8\n |pages=430&ndash;50\n |jstor = 2026308}}.

For example, the second-order sentence <math>\\forall P\\,\\forall x (x \\in P \\lor x \\notin P)</math> says that for every unary relation (or [[Set (mathematics)|set]]) ''P'' of individuals, and every individual ''x'', either ''x'' is in ''P'' or it is not (this is the [[principle of bivalence]]). Second-order logic also includes quantification over sets, functions, and other variables as explained in the section ''[[#Syntax and fragments|Syntax and fragments]]''. Both first-order and second-order logic use the idea of a [[domain of discourse]] (often called simply the \"domain\" or the \"universe\"). The domain is a set over which individual elements may be quantified.\n\n==Syntax and fragments==\n{{anchor|fragments}}\nThe syntax of second-order logic tells which expressions are well formed [[formula (mathematical logic)|formulas]]. In addition to the [[First-order logic#Formation rules|syntax of first-order logic]], second-order logic includes many new '''sorts''' (sometimes called '''types''') of variables. These are:\n* A sort of variables that range over sets of individuals. If ''S'' is a variable of this sort and ''t'' is a first-order term then the expression ''t'' \u2208 ''S'' (also written ''S''(''t''), or ''St'' to save parentheses) is an [[atomic formula]]. Sets of individuals can also be viewed as [[unary relation]]s on the domain.\n* For each natural number ''k'' there is a sort of variables that ranges over all ''k''-ary relations on the individuals. If ''R'' is such a ''k''-ary relation variable and ''t''<sub>1</sub>,...,''t''<sub>''k''</sub> are first-order terms then the expression ''R''(''t''<sub>1</sub>,...,''t''<sub>''k''</sub>) is an atomic formula.\n* For each natural number ''k'' there is a sort of variables that ranges over all functions taking ''k'' elements of the domain and returning a single element of the domain. If ''f'' is such a ''k''-ary function variable and ''t''<sub>1</sub>,...,''t''<sub>''k''</sub> are first-order terms then the expression ''f''(''t''<sub>1</sub>,...,''t''<sub>''k''</sub>) is a first-order term.\nEach of the variables just defined may be universally and/or existentially quantified over, to build up formulas. Thus there are many kinds of quantifiers, two for each sort of variables. A '''sentence''' in second-order logic, as in first-order logic, is a well-formed formula with no free variables (of any sort).\n\nIt's possible to forgo the introduction of function variables in the definition given above (and some authors do this) because an ''n''-ary function variable can be represented by a relation variable of arity ''n''+1 and an appropriate formula for the uniqueness of the \"result\" in the ''n''+1 argument of the relation. (Shapiro 2000, p.&nbsp;63)\n\n'''[[Monadic second-order logic]]''' (MSO) is a restriction of second-order logic in which only quantification over unary relations (i.e. sets) is allowed. Quantification over functions, owing to the equivalence to relations as described above, is thus also not allowed. The second-order logic without these restrictions is sometimes called '''full second-order logic''' to distinguish it from the monadic version. Monadic second-order logic is particularly used in the context of [[Courcelle's theorem]], an algorithmic meta-theorem in [[graph theory]].\n\nJust as in first-order logic, second-order logic may include [[non-logical symbols]] in a particular second-order language. These are restricted, however, in that all terms that they form must be either first-order terms (which can be substituted for a first-order variable) or second-order terms (which can be substituted for a second-order variable of an appropriate sort).\n\nA formula in second-order logic is said to be of first-order (and sometimes denoted <math>\\Sigma^1_0</math> or <math>\\Pi^1_0</math>) if its quantifiers (which may be of either type) range only over variables of first order, although it may have free variables of second order. A <math>\\Sigma^1_1</math> (existential second-order) formula is one additionally having some existential quantifiers over second order variables, i.e. <math>\\exists R_0\\ldots\\exists R_m \\phi</math>, where <math>\\phi</math> is a first-order formula. The fragment of second order logic consisting only of existential second-order formulas is called '''existential second-order logic''' and abbreviated as ESO, as <math>\\Sigma^1_1</math>, or even as \u2203SO. The fragment of <math>\\Pi^1_1</math> formulas is defined dually, it is called universal second-order logic. More expressive fragments are defined for any ''k'' > 0 by mutual recursion: <math>\\Sigma^1_{k+1}</math> has the form <math>\\exists R_0\\ldots\\exists R_m \\phi</math>, where <math>\\phi</math> is a <math>\\Pi^1_k</math> formula, and similar, <math>\\Pi^1_{k+1}</math> has the form <math>\\forall R_0\\ldots\\forall R_m \\phi</math>, where <math>\\phi</math> is a <math>\\Sigma^1_k</math> formula. (See [[analytical hierarchy]] for the analogous construction of [[second-order arithmetic]].)\n\n==Semantics==\nThe semantics of second-order logic establish the meaning of each sentence. Unlike first-order logic, which has only one standard semantics, there are two different semantics that are commonly used for second-order logic: '''standard semantics''' and '''Henkin semantics'''. In each of these semantics, the interpretations of the first-order quantifiers and the logical connectives are the same as in first-order logic. Only the ranges of quantifiers over second-order variables differ in the two types of semantics [[#Vaananen2001|(V\u00e4\u00e4n\u00e4nen 2001)]].\n\nIn standard semantics, also called full semantics, the quantifiers range over ''all'' sets or functions of the appropriate sort. Thus once the domain of the first-order variables is established, the meaning of the remaining quantifiers is fixed. It is these semantics that give second-order logic its expressive power, and they will be assumed for the remainder of this article.\n\nIn Henkin semantics, each sort of second-order variable has a particular domain of its own to range over, which may be a proper subset of all sets or functions of that sort. [[Leon Henkin]] (1950) defined these semantics and proved that [[G\u00f6del's completeness theorem]] and [[compactness theorem]], which hold for first-order logic, carry over to second-order logic with Henkin semantics. This is because Henkin semantics are almost identical to many-sorted first-order semantics, where additional sorts of variables are added to simulate the new variables of second-order logic. Second-order logic with Henkin semantics is not more expressive than first-order logic. Henkin semantics are commonly used in the study of [[second-order arithmetic]].\n\nV\u00e4\u00e4n\u00e4nen [[#Vaananen2001|(2001)]] argued that the choice between Henkin models and full models for second-order logic is analogous to the choice between [[ZFC]] and ''[[Von Neumann universe|V]]'' as a basis for set theory: \"As with second-order logic, we cannot really choose whether we axiomatize mathematics using ''V'' or ZFC. The result is the same in both cases, as ZFC ''is'' the best attempt so far to use ''V'' as an axiomatization of mathematics.\"\n\n==Expressive power==\nSecond-order logic is more expressive than first-order logic. For example, if the domain is the set of all [[real number]]s, one can assert in first-order logic the existence of an additive inverse of each real number by writing \u2200''x'' \u2203''y'' (''x'' + ''y'' = 0) but one needs second-order logic to assert the [[Supremum|least-upper-bound]] property for sets of real numbers, which states that every bounded, nonempty set of real numbers has a [[supremum]]. If the domain is the set of all real numbers, the following second-order sentence (split over two lines) expresses the least upper bound property:\n: (&forall; A) ([{{color|#800000|(&exist; ''w'') (''w'' &isin; A)}} &and; {{color|#008000|(&exist; ''z'')(&forall; ''u'')(''u'' &isin; A &rarr; ''u'' &le; ''z'')}}] \n::&rarr; {{color|#0000BB|(&exist; ''x'')(&forall; ''y'')([(&forall; ''w'')(''w'' &isin; A &rarr; ''w'' &le; ''x'') &and; (&forall; ''u'')(''u'' &isin; A &rarr; ''u'' &le; ''y'')] &rarr; ''x'' &le; ''y'')}})\nThis formula is a direct formalization of \"every {{color|#800000|nonempty}}, {{color|#008000|bounded}} set A {{color|#0000BB|has a least upper bound}}.\" It can be shown that any [[ordered field]] that satisfies this property is isomorphic to the real number field. On the other hand, the set of first-order sentences valid in the reals has arbitrarily large models due to the compactness theorem. Thus the least-upper-bound property cannot be expressed by any set of sentences in first-order logic.  (In fact, every [[real-closed field]] satisfies the same first-order sentences in the signature <math>\\langle +,\\cdot,\\le\\rangle</math> as the real numbers.)\n\nIn second-order logic, it is possible to write formal sentences which say \"the domain is [[finite set|finite]]\" or \"the domain is of [[countable set|countable]] [[cardinality]].\" To say that the domain is finite, use the sentence that says that every [[surjective]] function from the domain to itself is [[injective]]. To say that the domain has countable cardinality, use the sentence that says that there is a [[bijection]] between every two infinite subsets of the domain. It follows from the [[compactness theorem]] and the [[upward L\u00f6wenheim\u2013Skolem theorem]] that it is not possible to characterize finiteness or countability, respectively, in first-order logic.\n\nCertain fragments of second order logic like ESO are also more expressive than first-order logic even though they are strictly less expressive than the full second-order logic. ESO also enjoys translation equivalence with some extensions of first-order logic which allow non-linear ordering of quantifier dependencies, like first-order logic extended with [[Henkin quantifier]]s, [[Hintikka]] and Sandu's [[independence-friendly logic]], and V\u00e4\u00e4n\u00e4nen's [[dependence logic]].\n\n==Deductive systems==\n\nA [[deductive system]] for a logic is a set of [[inference rules]] and logical axioms that determine which sequences of formulas constitute valid proofs. Several deductive systems can be used for second-order logic, although none can be complete for the standard semantics (see below). Each of these systems is [[soundness|sound]], which means any sentence they can be used to prove is logically valid in the appropriate semantics.\n\nThe weakest deductive system that can be used consists of a standard deductive system for first-order logic (such as [[natural deduction]]) augmented with substitution rules for second-order terms.<ref>Such a system is used without comment by Hinman (2005).</ref> This deductive system is commonly used in the study of [[second-order arithmetic]].\n\nThe deductive systems considered by Shapiro (1991) and Henkin (1950) add to the augmented first-order deductive scheme both comprehension axioms and choice axioms. These axioms are sound for standard second-order semantics. They are sound for Henkin semantics restricted to Henkin models satisfying the comprehension and choice axioms.<ref>These are the models originally studied by Henkin (1950).</ref>\n\n==Non-reducibility to first-order logic==\n\nOne might attempt to reduce the second-order theory of the real numbers, with full second-order semantics, to the first-order theory in the following way. First expand the domain from the set of all real numbers to a two-sorted domain, with the second sort containing all ''sets of'' real numbers. Add a new binary predicate to the language: the membership relation. Then sentences that were second-order become first-order, with the formerly second-order quantifiers ranging over the second sort instead. This reduction can be attempted in a one-sorted theory by adding unary predicates that tell whether an element is a number or a set, and taking the domain to be the union of the set of real numbers and the [[power set]] of the real numbers.\n\nBut notice that the domain was asserted to include '''''all''''' sets of real numbers. That requirement cannot be reduced to a first-order sentence, as the [[L\u00f6wenheim\u2013Skolem theorem]] shows. That theorem implies that there is some [[countably infinite]] subset of the real numbers, whose members we will call ''internal numbers'', and some countably infinite collection of sets of internal numbers, whose members we will call \"internal sets\", such that the domain consisting of internal numbers and internal sets satisfies exactly the same first-order sentences as are satisfied by the domain of real numbers and sets of real numbers. In particular, it satisfies a sort of least-upper-bound axiom that says, in effect:\n\n:Every nonempty ''internal'' set that has an ''internal'' upper bound has a least ''internal'' upper bound.\n\nCountability of the set of all internal numbers (in conjunction with the fact that those form a densely ordered set) implies that that set does not satisfy the full least-upper-bound axiom. Countability of the set of all ''internal'' sets implies that it is not the set of ''all'' subsets of the set of all ''internal'' numbers (since [[Cantor's theorem]] implies that the set of all subsets of a countably infinite set is an uncountably infinite set). This construction is closely related to [[Skolem's paradox]].\n\nThus the first-order theory of real numbers and sets of real numbers has many models, some of which are countable. The second-order theory of the real numbers has only one model, however.\nThis follows from the classical theorem that there is only one [[Archimedean property|Archimedean]] [[real number|complete ordered field]], along with the fact that all the axioms of an Archimedean complete ordered field are expressible in second-order logic. This shows that the second-order theory of the real numbers cannot be reduced to a first-order theory, in the sense that the second-order theory of the real numbers has only one model but the corresponding first-order theory has many models.\n\nThere are more extreme examples showing that second-order logic with standard semantics is more expressive than first-order logic. There is a finite second-order theory whose only model is the real numbers if the [[continuum hypothesis]] holds and which has no model if the continuum hypothesis does not hold (cf. Shapiro 2000, p.&nbsp;105). This theory consists of a finite theory characterizing the real numbers as a complete Archimedean ordered field plus an axiom saying that the domain is of the first uncountable cardinality. This example illustrates that the question of whether a sentence in second-order logic is consistent is extremely subtle.\n\nAdditional limitations of second order logic are described in the next section.\n\n==Metalogical results==\nIt is a corollary of [[G\u00f6del's incompleteness theorem]] that there is no deductive system (that is, no notion of ''provability'') for second-order formulas that simultaneously satisfies these three desired attributes:<ref>The proof of this corollary is that a sound, complete, and effective deduction system for standard semantics could be used to produce a [[recursively enumerable]] completion of [[Peano arithmetic]], which G\u00f6del's theorem shows cannot exist.</ref>\n\n* ([[Soundness]]) Every provable second-order sentence is universally valid, i.e., true in all domains under standard semantics.\n* ([[Completeness (logic)|Completeness]]) Every universally valid second-order formula, under standard semantics, is provable.\n* ([[Decidability (logic)|Effectiveness]]) There is a [[automated proof checking|proof-checking]] algorithm that can correctly decide whether a given sequence of symbols is a proof or not.\n\nThis corollary is sometimes expressed by saying that second-order logic does not admit a complete [[proof theory]]. In this respect second-order logic with standard semantics differs from first-order logic; [[W. V. Quine|Quine]] (1970, pp.&nbsp;90&ndash;91) pointed to the lack of a complete proof system as a reason for thinking of second-order logic as not ''logic'', properly speaking.\n\nAs mentioned above, Henkin proved that the standard deductive system for first-order logic is sound, complete, and effective for second-order logic with [[Higher-order logic|Henkin semantics]], and the deductive system with comprehension and choice principles is sound, complete, and effective for Henkin semantics using only models that satisfy these principles.\n\nThe [[compactness theorem]] and the [[L\u00f6wenheim\u2013Skolem theorem]] do not hold for full models of second-order logic. They do hold however for Henkin models. [[#Vaananen2001|(V\u00e4\u00e4n\u00e4nen 2001)]]\n\n==History and disputed value==\n\nPredicate logic was introduced to the mathematical community by [[Charles Sanders Peirce|C. S. Peirce]], who coined the term ''second-order logic'' and whose notation is most similar to the modern form (Putnam 1982). However, today most students of logic are more familiar with the works of [[Gottlob Frege|Frege]], who published his work several years prior to Peirce but whose works remained less known until [[Bertrand Russell]] and [[Alfred North Whitehead]] made them famous.  Frege used different variables to distinguish quantification over objects from quantification over properties and sets; but he did not see himself as doing two different kinds of logic.  After the discovery of [[Russell's paradox]] it was realized that something was wrong with his system.  Eventually logicians found that restricting Frege's logic in various ways\u2014to what is now called [[First-order predicate calculus|first-order logic]]\u2014eliminated this problem: sets and properties cannot be quantified over in first-order-logic alone.  The now-standard hierarchy of orders of logics dates from this time.\n\nIt was found that [[set theory]] could be formulated as an axiomatized system within the apparatus of first-order logic (at the cost of several kinds of [[completeness (logic)|completeness]], but nothing so bad as Russell's paradox), and this was done (see [[Zermelo\u2013Fraenkel set theory]]), as sets are vital for [[mathematics]].  [[Arithmetic]], [[mereology]], and a variety of other powerful logical theories could be formulated axiomatically without appeal to any more logical apparatus than first-order quantification, and this, along with G\u00f6del and Skolem's adherence to first-order logic, led to a general decline in work in second (or any higher) order logic.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}\n\nThis rejection was actively advanced by some logicians, most notably [[W. V. Quine]].  Quine advanced the view{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} that in predicate-language sentences like ''Fx'' the \"''x''\" is to be thought of as a variable or name denoting an object and hence can be quantified over, as in \"For all things, it is the case that . . .\" but the \"''F''\" is to be thought of as an ''abbreviation'' for an incomplete sentence, not the name of an object (not even of an [[abstract object]] like a property).  For example, it might mean \" . . . is a dog.\"  But it makes no sense to think we can quantify over something like this. (Such a position is quite consistent with Frege's own arguments on the [[concept and object|concept-object]] distinction). So to use a predicate as a variable is to have it occupy the place of a name which only individual variables should occupy. This reasoning has been rejected by Boolos.\n\nIn recent years{{when|date=October 2017}} second-order logic has made something of a recovery, buoyed by [[George Boolos]]'s interpretation of second-order quantification as [[plural quantification]] over the same domain of objects as first-order quantification (Boolos 1984).  Boolos furthermore points to the claimed [[nonfirstorderizability]] of sentences such as \"Some critics admire only each other\" and \"Some of Fianchetto's men went into the warehouse unaccompanied by anyone else\", which he argues can only be expressed by the full force of second-order quantification.  However, [[generalized quantifier|generalized quantification]] and partially ordered, or branching, quantification may suffice to express a certain class of purportedly nonfirstorderizable sentences as well and it does not appeal to second-order quantification.\n\n== Relation to computational complexity==\n{{anchor|Applications to complexity|relation to computational complexity}}\n{{main|SO (complexity)}}\nThe expressive power of various forms of second-order logic on finite structures is intimately tied to [[computational complexity theory]]. The field of [[descriptive complexity]] studies which computational [[complexity class]]es can be characterized by the power of the logic needed to express languages (sets of finite strings) in  them. A string ''w''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''w''<sub>1</sub>\u00b7\u00b7\u00b7''w<sub>n</sub>'' in a finite alphabet ''A'' can be represented by a finite structure with domain ''D''&nbsp;=&nbsp;{1,...,''n''}, unary predicates ''P<sub>a</sub>'' for each ''a''&nbsp;\u2208&nbsp;''A'', satisfied by those indices ''i'' such that ''w<sub>i</sub>''&nbsp;=&nbsp;''a'', and additional predicates which serve to uniquely identify which index is which (typically, one takes the graph of the successor function on ''D'' or the order relation <, possibly with other arithmetic predicates). Conversely, the table of any finite structure can be encoded by a finite string.\n\nThis identification leads to the following characterizations of variants of second-order logic over finite structures:\n* REG (the set of [[regular language]]s) is definable by monadic, second-order formulas ([[B\u00fcchi's theorem]], 1960)\n* [[NP (complexity)|NP]] is the set of languages definable by existential, second-order formulas ([[Fagin's theorem]], 1974).\n* [[co-NP]] is the set of languages definable by universal, second-order formulas.\n* [[PH (complexity)|PH]] is the set of languages definable by second-order formulas.\n* [[PSPACE]] is the set of languages definable by second-order formulas with an added [[transitive closure]] operator.\n* [[EXPTIME]] is the set of languages definable by second-order formulas with an added [[least fixed point]] operator.\nRelationships among these classes directly impact the relative expressiveness of the logics over finite structures; for example, if '''PH'''&nbsp;=&nbsp;'''PSPACE''', then adding a transitive closure operator to second-order logic would not make it any more expressive over finite structures.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Philosophy}}\n* [[First-order logic]]\n* [[Higher-order logic]]\n* [[L\u00f6wenheim number]]\n* [[Omega language]]\n* [[Second-order propositional logic]]\n\n==Notes==\n<references/>\n\n==References==\n* {{cite book\n | author=Andrews, Peter\n | year=2002\n | title=An Introduction to Mathematical Logic and Type Theory: To Truth Through Proof\n | edition =2nd\n | publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers}}\n*{{cite journal\n |doi = 10.2307/2026308\n |author = Boolos, George\n |year= 1984\n | title=To Be Is To Be a Value of a Variable (or to Be Some Values of Some Variables)\n | journal=Journal of Philosophy\n | volume=81\n |issue = 8\n |pages=430&ndash;50\n |jstor = 2026308}}.

His [[temple name]] was \"Taizu\" (\u592a\u7956) while his [[posthumous name]] was \"Emperor Gao\" (\u9ad8\u7687\u5e1d); \"Gaozu of Han\", derived from the ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'', is the common way of referring to this sovereign even though he was not accorded the temple name \"Gaozu\". Liu Bang was one of the few dynasty founders in Chinese history who was born in a peasant family.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Gaozu-emperor-of-Han-dynasty|title=Gaozu Emperor of Han Dynasty|last=|first=|date=|website= |publisher=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nPrior to coming to power, Liu Bang initially served for the [[Qin dynasty]] as a [[law enforcement officer]] in his home town [[Pei County]], within the [[Chu (state)|conquered state of Chu]].  With the [[Qin Shi Huang|First Emperor]]'s death and the Qin Empire's subsequent political chaos, Liu Bang renounced his [[civil service]] position and became an anti-Qin rebel leader.  He won the race against fellow rebel leader [[Xiang Yu]] to invade the [[Guanzhong|Qin heartland]] and forced the surrender of the [[Ziying|last Qin ruler]] in 206 BCE.\n\nAfter the fall of the Qin, Xiang Yu, as the ''de facto'' chief of the rebel forces, divided the former Qin Empire into the [[Eighteen Kingdoms]], and Liu Bang was forced to accept the poor and remote Bashu region (parts of present-day [[Sichuan]] and [[Chongqing]]) with the title \"'''King of Han'''\" ({{zh|t=\u6f22\u738b|p=H\u00e0n W\u00e1ng}}).  Within the year, Liu Bang broke out with his army and conquered the [[Three Qins]], starting a civil war known as the [[Chu\u2013Han Contention]] as various forces battled for supremacy over China.\n\nIn 202 BCE, Liu Bang emerged victorious following the [[Battle of Gaixia]], unified most of China under his control, and established the Han dynasty with himself as the founding emperor. During his reign, Liu Bang reduced taxes and [[corv\u00e9e]], promoted [[Confucianism]], and suppressed revolts by the lords of non-Liu [[vassal]] states, among many other actions.  He also initiated the policy of ''[[heqin]]'' to maintain a ''[[de jure]]'' peace between the Han Empire and the [[Xiongnu]] after losing the [[Battle of Baideng]] in 200 BCE.  He died in 195 BCE and was succeeded by his son, [[Emperor Hui of Han|Liu Ying]].\n\n==Birth and early life==\nIn imperial Han myth, Liu Bang was a descendant of the mythical [[Emperor Yao]], who descended from the [[Yellow Emperor]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4raAAgAAQBAJ&lpg=PP1&hl=en&pg=PA171#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Women and the family in Chinese history|author=Patricia Buckley Ebrey|editor=|year=2003|page=171|pages= |publisher=Psychology Press|volume=Volume 2 of Critical Asian scholarship|edition=illustrated|location=|isbn=0-415-28823-1|accessdate=22 March 2019}}</ref> It was a common practice among many ancient Chinese noble families to claim descent from the mythical Yellow Emperor, in order to proclaim [[Mandate of Heaven|divine ruling legitimacy]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MioRmEq2xHUC&pg=PA505&dq=huangdi+family+tree#v=onepage&q=huangdi%20family%20tree&f=false|title=The encyclopedia of Taoism, Volume 1|author=Fabrizio Pregadio|editor=Fabrizio Pregadio|year=2008 |page=505|pages=|publisher=Psychology Press|volume=|edition=ill ustrated|location=|isbn=0-7007-1200-3|accessdate=22 March 2019}}</ref>\n\nLiu Bang was born to a peasant family in Zhongyang Village (\u4e2d\u967d\u91cc), [[Feng County, Jiangsu|Feng Township]] (\u4e30\u9091), [[Pei County]] (\u6c9b\u7e23) in the state of [[Chu (state)|Chu]] during the late years of the [[Warring States period]].<ref name=\"Birthplace\"/> His parents' names were not recorded in history; they were simply referred to as \"[[Liu Taigong]]\" (\u5289\u592a\u516c; lit. \"Old Sir Liu\") and \"Liu Ao\" (\u5289\u5aaa;<ref>Note that the Chinese character \"\u5aaa\" (\u01ceo) was not the personal name of Liu's mother. It was used as a formal way of addressing an old woman at the time. See the [http://www.mdbg.net/chindict/chindict.php?page=chardict&cdcanoce=0&cdqchi=\u5aaadictionary definition of \u5aaa].</ref> lit. \"Old Madam Liu\"). According to legend, before Liu Bang's birth, his mother was caught in a rainstorm and took shelter under a bridge. At that moment, lightning struck and the sky darkened. Liu Bang's father went to fetch his wife home and saw a dragon hovering above her. She became pregnant and later gave birth to Liu Bang.<ref name=\"iub.edu\">[http://www.iub.edu/~g380/4.3-Rise-2010.pdf Translation] of Sima Qian's ''Shiji''.</ref>\n\nIt was subsequently recorded that the young Liu Bang was outspoken, charismatic and of great generosity and forbearance. However, he enjoyed loafing, disliked reading, showed no interest in farming and [[manual labour]] and frequently ran into trouble with the law, hence his father often called him a \"little rascal\" for his lazy lifestyle. Liu Bang persisted in his idling ways and depended on his brother's family for food and lodging. When he grew older, he became a good friend and live-in companion of a former [[Retainers in early China (social group)|retainer]] of [[Lord Xinling]] named Zhang Er ({{zh|t=\u5f35\u8033}}, ? \u2014 202 BCE), who, at the time, was the [[county magistrate|magistrate]] of the nearby [[Minquan County|Waihuang County]].\n\nAfter Qin conquered Chu, Zhang Er went into hiding, and Liu Bang returned to his own home town in Pei County.  Contrary to other claims, he did not take any civil service exam as it did not exist yet at that time. Instead, he was later recommended and appointed as the local [[sheriff]] (\u4ead\u9577) at Sishui Pavilion (\u6cd7\u6c34\u4ead) in [[Pei County]], through the aid and supervision of his close friends [[Xiao He]] and [[Cao Shen]], who worked at the county office and often helped cover up his delinquent behaviour.  He nevertheless forged close relationships with most of the local county bureaucrats, and earned himself a small reputation in the district.  Liu Bang was once sent for [[statute labour]] in the capital [[Xianyang]], and encountered the [[First Emperor]] going on an inspection tour around the nation.  Awed by the majestic sight of the royal convoy, he exclaimed, \"Alas, this is how a great man should be! (\u55df\u4e4e\uff0c\u5927\u4e08\u592b\u7576\u5982\u6b64\u4e5f)\"\n\nOne day, L\u00fc Wen (\u5442\u6587), a wealthy and influential [[gentry]] from [[Shan County|Shanfu County]], who had recently moved to Pei County, was putting on a feast to host the local elites.  [[Xiao He]], who was in charge of helping L\u00fc Wen collect gifts from the visitors, announced that \"those who do not offer more than 1,000 coins worth of gifts shall be seated outside the hall\".  Liu Bang went to the feast without bringing any money but said, \"I offer 10,000 coins.\"  L\u00fc Wen saw Liu Bang and was so impressed with him on first sight, that he immediately stood up and welcomed Liu into the hall to sit beside him, despite Xiao He telling him that Liu Bang was not being serious.  L\u00fc Wen chatted with Liu Bang, and said, \"I used to predict fortunes for many people but I have never before seen someone so exceptional like you.\"  He then offered his daughter [[Empress L\u00fc Zhi|L\u00fc Zhi]]'s hand in marriage to Liu Bang.  After they were wed, L\u00fc Zhi bore Liu Bang a son Liu Ying (the future [[Emperor Hui of Han|Emperor Hui]]) and a daughter (the future [[Princess Yuan of Lu]]).\n\n==Insurrection against the Qin dynasty==\n[[File:Qin Uprisings.png|thumb|Uprisings of Qin Dynasty. Liu Bang's campaign is shown in purple.]]\n[[File:Liu Bang.jpg|thumb|Liu Bang, in an illustration by Qing-dynasty artist Shangguan Zhou \u4e0a\u5b98\u5468 (1665\u20131749)]]\nLiu Bang had been tasked with escorting a group of convicts to [[Mount Li]] where they would be put to work to help build the [[Mausoleum of the First Qin Emperor|First Emperor's mausoleum]]. A few prisoners managed to escape during the journey. Liu Bang began to fear for his life as having convicts escape under one's care was, under the laws of the ruling [[Qin dynasty]], a capital offence. Realizing that to keep his life he'd have to flee, Liu Bang decided to release the remaining prisoners in his care. A few of these convicts were so grateful to be set free that they decided to join Liu Bang of their own accord.\n\nAccording to legend they encountered a gigantic white serpent which killed members of Liu Bang's group with its poisonous breath. It is said that while drunk, Liu Bang slew the serpent that night and later encountered an old woman weeping by the side of the road the next morning. When the men following Liu asked her why she was crying, she replied, \"My child, the White Emperor's son, has been slain by the son of the Red Emperor.\"  She then mysteriously disappeared. After hearing the old woman's strange words, Liu Bang's followers believed that he was destined to become a ruler in the future and became even more impressed with him. This event is known as the \"Uprising of the Slaying of the White Serpent\" ({{zh|t=\u65ac\u767d\u86c7\u8d77\u7fa9}}).<ref>{{cite web |last1=. |first1=\u4e09\u4e09\u4e24\u4e24 |title=\u5289\u90a6\u7684\u6210\u529f\u4e4b\u9053\uff0c\u70ba\u4ec0\u9ebc\u8d0f\u7684\u662f\u4ed6\uff1f |url=https://www.0-news.info/history/liubang-de-chenggong-zhi-dao/ |url=https://www.0-news.info/ |accessdate=21 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nLiu Bang and his followers took refuge on [[Mount Mangdang]] (in present-day [[Yongcheng]], [[Shangqiu]], [[Henan]]) and lived as outlaws in an abandoned stronghold. Liu had maintained secret contact with some of his old friends such as Xiao He and Cao Shen who still lived in Pei County. In 209&nbsp;BCE, two men named [[Chen Sheng]] and [[Wu Guang]] began the [[Dazexiang Uprising]] to overthrow the Qin dynasty. The magistrate of Pei County considered joining the rebellion as well and acting on the advice of both Xiao He and Cao Shen, he sent [[Fan Kuai]] (a relative of Liu Bang) to invite Liu and his followers back to Pei County to support him. However, he later decided against it and ended up denying Liu Bang entry into his lands. He also worried that Liu's friends Xiao He and Cao Shen might decide to open the gates for Liu now that he had been denied entry, so he set a plan in motion to kill them but Xiao and Cao managed to escape before it was put into action and eventually joined up with Liu and his entourage. While in Liu's company, Xiao came up with a plan to gain entry into the county and managed to convince Liu to take his advice. Liu Bang ordered his men to write letters, wrap them around their arrows and fire the arrows over the border and into the neighboring county from which they had been barred. In the letters they urged the local townsfolk to help him. The peasants responded to this call for aid by killing the magistrate and welcoming Liu back into Pei County. Liu Bang decided to style himself the \"Duke of Pei\" (\u6c9b\u516c) after this and became known to others by this title.\n\nIn 208 BCE, during the reign of [[Qin Er Shi]], the descendants of the former royal families who had ruled over the states of [[Yan (state)|Yan]], [[Zhao (state)|Zhao]], [[Qi (state)|Qi]] and [[Wei (state)|Wei]] rebelled against the Qin Empire in the hope of restoring their former kingdoms. All of which had been conquered by the Qin dynasty in [[Qin's wars of unification|a series of wars]] to unify China under one ruler (the later Qin Emperor) about two decades earlier. In the county of Wu (present-day [[Jiangsu]]), a commoner named [[Xiang Liang]] (whose father had been a general for the state of Chu during the wars of unification) began his own uprising and installed [[Emperor Yi of Chu|Xiong Xin]] as \"King Huai the Latter\" (\u695a\u5f8c\u61f7\u738b) on the throne of the former [[Chu (state)|Chu state]]. Liu Bang decided to join Xiang Liang's rebellion and served in Chu for some time. After Xiang Liang was killed in action at the Battle of Dingtao, King Huai II sent Xiang Liang's nephew [[Xiang Yu]] and minister [[Song Yi (Qin dynasty)|Song Yi]] to lead an army to reinforce the Zhao state, which was under attack by Qin forces.\n\nLiu Bang was later granted the title \"Marquis of Wu'an\" (\u6b66\u5b89\u4faf) by the king and tasked with leading an army which was to attack Qin. The king then promised that whoever entered [[Guanzhong]] (the heartland of the Qin state) first would receive the title \"King of Guanzhong\". In 206&nbsp;BCE, Liu Bang managed to beat Xiang Yu in the race to Guanzhong and arrived outside of the Qin capital. [[Ziying]] who would end up being the last ruler of the Qin dynasty, surrendered the capital city of [[Xianyang]] to Liu Bang's forces.  Liu issued strict orders to his men which forbade them from killing any innocent civilians or pillaging the city. Thanks to this, peace and stability were temporarily restored in Xianyang while Liu Bang's forces were stationed there. Liu's friend and confidante Xiao He ordered the collection of all the legal documents in the Qin palace and government facilities so they could be preserved and safely transported away.\n\n== Chu\u2013Han Contention ==\n{{Main|Chu\u2013Han Contention}}\n\n===Feast at Hong Gate===\n{{Main|Feast at Hong Gate}}\n[[File:Mural Painting of a Banquet Scene from the Han Dynasty Tomb of Ta-hu-t'ing.jpg|thumb|300px|A late [[Eastern Han]] (25\u2013220 AD) [[Chinese painting|Chinese tomb mural]] showing lively scenes of a banquet (yanyin \u5bb4\u98f2), dance and music (wuyue \u821e\u6a02), acrobatics (baixi \u767e\u620f), and wrestling (xiangbu \u76f8\u6251), [[c:Category:Dahuting Tomb murals|from the Dahuting Tomb]] (Chinese: \u6253\u864e\u4ead\u6f22\u5893, Pinyin: ''Dahuting Han mu''), on the southern bank of the [[Suihe River]] in [[Zhengzhou]], [[Henan province]], China (just west of [[Xi County, Henan|Xi County]])]]\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = 01 Wine vessel Western Han dynasty.jpg\n| width1 = 150\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Shanxi Museum 2009 Taiyuan 839.jpg\n| width2 = 182\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = '''Left:''' A [[jade]]-carved wine cup with [[relief]] decorations, [[Western Han]] (202 BCE \u2013 9 CE) <br>'''Right:''' a gilded bronze [[wine warmer]] with animalistic relief decorations, 26 BCE, [[Western Han]] period\n}}\n[[File:Met, female dancer, western han dynasty, 2nd century BC.JPG|thumb|upright|A [[Western Han]] female dancer in [[silk]] robes, 2nd century BC, [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]; [[Xiang Zhuang]] intended to assassinate Liu Bang by pretending to do a [[sword dance]]]]\n[[Xiang Yu]] was dissatisfied that Liu Bang had beat him in the race to [[Guanzhong]]. Instigated by his advisor [[Fan Zeng]] and Cao Wushang (\u66f9\u7121\u50b7), an informer from Liu Bang's camp, he decided to set a trap to kill Liu Bang.  He pretended to invite Liu Bang to a banquet, while secretly planning to assassinate Liu during the feast.  However, Xiang Yu's uncle, [[Xiang Bo]], was a close friend of Liu Bang's strategist [[Zhang Liang (Western Han)|Zhang Liang]], and managed to persuade his nephew to not personally order Liu Bang's execution on the feast.  Frustrated by Xiang Yu's indecisiveness, Fan Zeng then ordered Xiang Yu's cousin [[Xiang Zhuang]] to pretend performing a [[sword dance]] and use the opportunity to kill Liu Bang, but Xiang Bo volunteered to join the dance and blocked his nephew every time he thrust his sword towards Liu Bang.\n\nSeeing Liu Bang was in mortal danger, Zhang Liang sneaked outside and summoned Liu Bang's brother-in-law and personal bodyguard [[Fan Kuai]], who then crashed the party clad in full armor and scolded Xiang Yu for the sinister plot.  Embarrassed by Fan Kuai's accusation, Xiang Yu ordered the sword dance to stop and rewarded Fan Kuai for his bravery.  Liu Bang then pretended to go to the latrine and used the chance to escape Xiang Yu's camp unannounced.  He and his forces then evacuated from Xianyang and retreated west.  Xiang Yu led his forces into Xianyang, where they plundered and pillaged the city and burnt down the [[Epang Palace]].\n\n[[Records of the Grand Historian]] recounts an event during this conflict, an event omitted from the emperor's own biography but present in the biography of Xiang Yu, where he pushed his own children out of his carriage to lighten it in a desperate attempt to escape in a chase from Xiang Yu's men.{{sfnp|Watson|1958|pp=95\u201398}}\n\n===Conquest of the Three Qin===\nAfter occupying Xianyang, Xiang Yu proclaimed himself \"Hegemon-King of Western Chu\" and split the former Qin Empire into the [[Eighteen Kingdoms]]. The Guanzhong area, which was rightfully Liu Bang's per [[Emperor Yi of Chu|King Huai II]]'s earlier promise, was given by Xiang Yu to [[Three Qins|three former Qin generals]] instead. Liu Bang was relocated to [[Hanzhong]] in the remote Bashu region (in present-day [[Sichuan]]) and received the title \"King of Han\" (\u6f22\u738b). When a rebellion broke out in the [[Qi (state)|Qi kingdom]] in late 206&nbsp;BCE, Xiang Yu left Western Chu to suppress the revolt. Liu Bang used the opportunity to invade and conquer Guanzhong and then attack several Chu territories, including the capital Pengcheng (\u5f6d\u57ce; present-day [[Xuzhou]], [[Jiangsu]]).\n\n===Battle of Gaixia===\nFrom 206\u2013202&nbsp;BCE, Liu Bang engaged Xiang Yu in a power struggle \u2013 historically known as the [[Chu\u2013Han Contention]] \u2013 for supremacy over China, while simultaneously attacking and subjugating the other kingdoms. In 203&nbsp;BCE, Xiang Yu and Liu Bang came to an armistice, known as the Treaty of Hong Canal, which divided China into east and west along the Hong Canal under the Chu and Han regimes respectively. A few months later, Liu Bang renounced the treaty and attacked Xiang Yu again. In 202&nbsp;BCE, Xiang Yu lost to Liu Bang at the [[Battle of Gaixia]] and committed suicide, after which Chu surrendered to Han. Liu Bang had unified much of China under his control by then.\n\n==Establishment of the Han dynasty==\n[[File:Emperor gao of han c01s06i01.jpg|thumb|A portrait painting of Emperor Gao of Han (Liu Bang), from an 18th-century Qing Dynasty album of Chinese emperors' portraits.]]\nIn 202&nbsp;BCE, Liu Bang was enthroned as the emperor with support from his subjects even though he expressed reluctance to take the throne. He named his dynasty \"[[Han dynasty|Han]]\", and was historically known as \"Emperor Gaozu\" (or \"Emperor Gao\"). He established the capital in [[Luoyang]] (later moved to [[Chang'an]]) and instated his official spouse [[Empress L\u00fc Zhi|L\u00fc Zhi]] as the empress and their son [[Emperor Hui of Han|Liu Ying]] as the [[crown prince]].\n\nThe following year, Emperor Gaozu wanted to reward his subjects who had contributed to the founding of the Han Empire, but the process dragged on for a year because they could not agree on the distribution of the rewards. The emperor thought that [[Xiao He]]'s contributions were the greatest, so he awarded Xiao the title \"Marquis of Zan\" and gave him the largest amount of food stores. Some of the others expressed objections because they thought that Xiao was not directly involved in battle so his contributions should not be considered the greatest. Emperor Gaozu replied that Xiao He should receive the highest credit because he planned their overall strategy in the war against Xiang Yu. He named [[Cao Shen]] as the person who made the greatest contributions in battle and rewarded him and the others accordingly.\n\n==Reign==\n{{Further|Han dynasty}}\n\n===Reducing taxes and corv\u00e9e===\nEmperor Gaozu disbanded his armies and allowed the soldiers to return home. He gave an order stating that the people who remained in [[Guanzhong]] were exempted from taxes and [[corv\u00e9e]] for 12 years while those who returned to their respective native territories were exempted for six years and that the central government would provide for them for a year. He also granted freedom to those who had sold themselves into slavery to avoid hunger during the wars. In 195&nbsp;BCE, the emperor issued two decrees: the first officialised the lowering of taxes and corv\u00e9e; the second set the amount of tribute to be paid by the [[Kings of the Han dynasty|vassal kings]] to the imperial court in the 10th month of every year. The land tax on agricultural production was reduced to a rate of 1/15 of crop yield. He also privatised the coinage.\n\n===Emphasis on Confucianism===\nIn his early days, Emperor Gaozu disliked reading and scorned [[Confucianism]]. After becoming the emperor, he still held the same attitudes towards Confucianism as he did before until he encountered the scholar [[Lu Jia (Western Han)|Lu Jia]] (or Lu Gu). Lu Gu wrote a 12-volume book, ''Xinyu'' (\u65b0\u8a9e), which espoused the benefits of governing by moral virtue as opposed to using harsh and punitive laws (as it was under the Qin dynasty). Lu Gu read each volume to the emperor after he finished writing it. The emperor was deeply impressed. Under Emperor Gaozu's reign, Confucianism flourished and gradually replaced [[Legalism (philosophy)|Legalism]] (of Qin times) as the state ideology. Confucian scholars, including Lu Gu, were recruited to serve in the government. The emperor also reformed the legal system by relaxing some laws inherited from the Qin regime and reducing the severity of certain penalties. In 196&nbsp;BCE, after suppressing a rebellion by [[Ying Bu]], he passed by [[Shandong]], the birthplace of [[Confucius]], and personally prepared for a ceremony to pay respect to the philosopher.\n\n===Dispute over the succession===\nIn his later years, Emperor Gaozu favoured [[Concubine Qi]] and neglected [[Empress L\u00fc Zhi]]. He thought that [[Emperor Hui of Han|Liu Ying]], his heir apparent (born to the empress), was too weak to be a ruler. Thus, he had the intention of replacing Liu Ying with another son, [[Liu Ruyi]], who was born to Concubine Qi. L\u00fc Zhi became worried, so she asked [[Zhang Liang (Western Han)|Zhang Liang]] to help her son maintain his position. Zhang Liang recommended four reclusive wise men, the [[Four Whiteheads of Mount Shang]], to help Liu Ying.\n\nIn 195&nbsp;BCE as Emperor Gaozu's health started to worsen, he desired even more to replace Liu Ying with Liu Ruyi as the crown prince. Zhang Liang tried to dissuade him but was ignored, so he retired on the excuse that he was ill. [[Shusun Tong]] (the crown prince's tutor) and Zhou Chang also strongly objected to the emperor's decision to replace Liu Ying with Liu Ruyi. Zhou Chang said, \"I am not good in arguing, but I know this is not right. If Your Majesty deposes the Crown Prince, I won't follow your orders any more.\"<ref>(\u81e3\u53e3\u4e0d\u80fd\u8a00\uff0c\u7136\u81e3\u671f\u671f\u77e5\u5176\u4e0d\u53ef\u3002\u965b\u4e0b\u96d6\u6b32\u5ee2\u592a\u5b50\uff0c\u81e3\u671f\u671f\u4e0d\u5949\u8a54\u3002)</ref> Zhou Chang was outspoken but he had a stuttering problem, which made his speech very amusing. The emperor laughed. After that, the Four Haos of Mount Shang showed up in the court. Emperor Gaozu was surprised to see them because they had previously declined to join the civil service when he invited them. The four men promised to help Liu Ying in the future if he were to remain as the crown prince. The emperor was pleased to see that Liu Ying had their support so he dismissed the idea of changing his heir apparent.<ref name=\"Ch'en2014\">{{cite book|author=Chi-yen Ch'en|title=Hsun Yueh and the Mind of Late Han China: A Translation of the SHEN-CHIEN|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Sar_AwAAQBAJ&pg=PA171#v=onepage&q&f=false|date=14 July 2014|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-1-4008-5348-9|pages=171\u2013}}</ref>\n\n===Military campaigns===\n{{further|Kings of the Han dynasty|Battle of Baideng|Heqin}}\n[[File:Western Han soldiers.jpg|thumb|[[Horses in East Asian warfare|Cavalry soldiers]], painted [[Chinese ceramics|ceramic statues]], [[Western Han]] period, [[Hainan Provincial Museum]]]]\nAfter establishing the Han dynasty, Emperor Gaozu appointed princes and [[Kings of the Han dynasty|vassal kings]] to help him govern the Han Empire and gave each of them a piece of land. There were seven vassal kings who were not related to the imperial clan: [[Zang Tu]], the King of Yan; [[King Xin of Han|H\u00e1n Xin]], the King of H\u00e1n; [[Han Xin]], the King of Chu; [[Peng Yue]], the King of Liang; [[Ying Bu]], the King of Huainan; Zhang Er, the King of Zhao; [[Wu Rui (King of Changsha)|Wu Rui]], the King of Changsha. However, later, the emperor became worried that the vassal kings might rebel against him because they, after all, had no blood relations with him. Han Xin and Peng Yue were (falsely) accused of treason, arrested and executed along with their families. Ying Bu and Zang Tu rebelled against him but were defeated and killed. Only Wu Rui and Zhang Er were left.\n\nThe [[Xiongnu]] in the north had been a threat since the [[Qin dynasty]]. [[Qin Shi Huang]] had sent the general [[Meng Tian]] to oversee the defences on the Qin Empire's northern border and the construction of the [[Great Wall of China|Great Wall]] to repel the invaders. Meng Tian achieved success in deterring the Xiongnu from advancing beyond the border. However, after the Qin dynasty collapsed, the Xiongnu seized the opportunity to move south and raid the border again. In 201&nbsp;BCE, H\u00e1n Xin (King of H\u00e1n) defected to the Xiongnu leader, [[Modu Chanyu|Modu]]. In the following year, Emperor Gaozu led an army to attack the Xiongnu but was besieged and trapped by the enemy at the [[Battle of Baideng]]. Acting on [[Chen Ping (Han dynasty)|Chen Ping]]'s advice, he bribed Modu's wife with gifts and got her to ask her husband to withdraw his forces. Modu did so. After returning to the capital, Emperor Gaozu initiated the policy of ''[[heqin]]'', which involved sending noble ladies to marry the Xiongnu leaders and paying annual tribute to the Xiongnu in exchange for peace between the Han Empire and the Xiongnu.\n\n{{-}}\n\n==Death==\n[[File:Changling 1.jpg|thumb|Changling (\u9577\u9675), [[Chinese pyramids|the tomb]] of Emperor Gaozu in Xianyang, Shaanxi.]]\n\nEmperor Gaozu was wounded by a stray arrow during the campaign against [[Ying Bu]]. He became seriously ill and remained in his inner chambers for a long period of time and ordered his guards to deny entry to everyone who tried to visit him. After several days, [[Fan Kuai]] barged into the chambers to see the emperor and the other subjects followed behind him. They saw Emperor Gaozu lying on his bed and attended to by a [[eunuch]]. Fan Kuai said, \"How glorious it was when Your Majesty first led us to conquer the empire and how weary we are now. Your subjects are worried when they learn that Your Majesty is ill, but Your Majesty refuses to see us and prefers the company of a eunuch instead. Has Your Majesty forgotten the incident about [[Zhao Gao]]?\" The emperor laughed and got out of bed to meet his subjects.\n\nEmperor Gaozu's health deteriorated later so [[Empress L\u00fc Zhi]] hired a famous physician to heal him. When Emperor Gaozu enquired about his condition, the physician told him that his illness could be cured, but the emperor was displeased and he scolded the physician, \"Isn't it Heaven's will that I managed to conquer this empire in simple clothing and with nothing but a sword? My life is determined by Heaven. It is useless even if [[Bian Que]] is here!\" He refused to continue with the treatment and sent the physician away. Before his death, he said that [[Cao Shen]] could succeed [[Xiao He]] as the [[Chancellor (China)|chancellor]] after Xiao died, and that Wang Ling could succeed Cao Shen. He also said that Wang Ling might be too young to perform his duties so [[Chen Ping (Han dynasty)|Chen Ping]] could assist Wang, but Chen was also qualified to assume the responsibilities of a chancellor all by himself. He also named [[Zhou Bo]] as a possible candidate for the role of Grand Commandant. He died in Changle Palace (\u9577\u6a02\u5bae) on 1 June 195&nbsp;BCE and was succeeded by Liu Ying, who became historically known as [[Emperor Hui of Han|Emperor Hui]].\n\n== Song of the Great Wind ==\nThe ''Song of the Great Wind'' was a song composed by Liu Bang in 195&nbsp;BCE when he visited his hometown in [[Pei County]] after suppressing [[Ying Bu]]'s rebellion. He prepared a banquet and invited all his old friends and townsfolk to join him. After some drinks, Liu Bang played the [[guqin]] and sang the ''Song of the Great Wind''.<ref>{{in lang|zh}} [http://www.guoxue.com/art/ss000/hvsc001/dfg005.htm \u5927\u98ce\u6b4c]</ref>\n\n{| border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"\n|-\n| style=\"font-size:100%\" |\n'''\u300a\u5927\u98a8\u6b4c\u300b'''\n|\n'''Song of the Great Wind'''\n|-\n| style=\"font-size:100%\" |\n\u5927\u98a8\u8d77\u516e\u96f2\u98db\u63da\uff0c\n|\n''A great wind came forth,''<br />\n''the clouds rose on high''.\n|-\n| style=\"font-size:100%\" |\n\u5a01\u52a0\u6d77\u5167\u516e\u6b78\u6545\u9109\uff0c\n|\n''Now that my might rules all within the seas,''<br />\n''I have returned to my old village''.\n|-\n| style=\"font-size:100%\" |\n\u5b89\u5f97\u731b\u58eb\u516e\u5b88\u56db\u65b9\uff01\n|\n''Where will I find brave men''<br />\n''to guard the four corners of my land?''\n|}\n\n<ref>{{cite book| author = John Minford|author2=Joseph S.

His [[temple name]] was \"Taizu\" (\u592a\u7956) while his [[posthumous name]] was \"Emperor Gao\" (\u9ad8\u7687\u5e1d); \"Gaozu of Han\", derived from the ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]'', is the common way of referring to this sovereign even though he was not accorded the temple name \"Gaozu\". Liu Bang was one of the few dynasty founders in Chinese history who was born in a peasant family.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.britannica.com/biography/Gaozu-emperor-of-Han-dynasty|title=Gaozu Emperor of Han Dynasty|last=|first=|date=|website= |publisher=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nPrior to coming to power, Liu Bang initially served for the [[Qin dynasty]] as a [[law enforcement officer]] in his home town [[Pei County]], within the [[Chu (state)|conquered state of Chu]].  With the [[Qin Shi Huang|First Emperor]]'s death and the Qin Empire's subsequent political chaos, Liu Bang renounced his [[civil service]] position and became an anti-Qin rebel leader.  He won the race against fellow rebel leader [[Xiang Yu]] to invade the [[Guanzhong|Qin heartland]] and forced the surrender of the [[Ziying|last Qin ruler]] in 206 BCE.\n\nAfter the fall of the Qin, Xiang Yu, as the ''de facto'' chief of the rebel forces, divided the former Qin Empire into the [[Eighteen Kingdoms]], and Liu Bang was forced to accept the poor and remote Bashu region (parts of present-day [[Sichuan]] and [[Chongqing]]) with the title \"'''King of Han'''\" ({{zh|t=\u6f22\u738b|p=H\u00e0n W\u00e1ng}}).  Within the year, Liu Bang broke out with his army and conquered the [[Three Qins]], starting a civil war known as the [[Chu\u2013Han Contention]] as various forces battled for supremacy over China.\n\nIn 202 BCE, Liu Bang emerged victorious following the [[Battle of Gaixia]], unified most of China under his control, and established the Han dynasty with himself as the founding emperor. During his reign, Liu Bang reduced taxes and [[corv\u00e9e]], promoted [[Confucianism]], and suppressed revolts by the lords of non-Liu [[vassal]] states, among many other actions.  He also initiated the policy of ''[[heqin]]'' to maintain a ''[[de jure]]'' peace between the Han Empire and the [[Xiongnu]] after losing the [[Battle of Baideng]] in 200 BCE.  He died in 195 BCE and was succeeded by his son, [[Emperor Hui of Han|Liu Ying]].\n\n==Birth and early life==\nIn imperial Han myth, Liu Bang was a descendant of the mythical [[Emperor Yao]], who descended from the [[Yellow Emperor]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4raAAgAAQBAJ&lpg=PP1&hl=en&pg=PA171#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Women and the family in Chinese history|author=Patricia Buckley Ebrey|editor=|year=2003|page=171|pages= |publisher=Psychology Press|volume=Volume 2 of Critical Asian scholarship|edition=illustrated|location=|isbn=0-415-28823-1|accessdate=22 March 2019}}</ref> It was a common practice among many ancient Chinese noble families to claim descent from the mythical Yellow Emperor, in order to proclaim [[Mandate of Heaven|divine ruling legitimacy]].<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MioRmEq2xHUC&pg=PA505&dq=huangdi+family+tree#v=onepage&q=huangdi%20family%20tree&f=false|title=The encyclopedia of Taoism, Volume 1|author=Fabrizio Pregadio|editor=Fabrizio Pregadio|year=2008 |page=505|pages=|publisher=Psychology Press|volume=|edition=ill ustrated|location=|isbn=0-7007-1200-3|accessdate=22 March 2019}}</ref>\n\nLiu Bang was born to a peasant family in Zhongyang Village (\u4e2d\u967d\u91cc), [[Feng County, Jiangsu|Feng Township]] (\u4e30\u9091), [[Pei County]] (\u6c9b\u7e23) in the state of [[Chu (state)|Chu]] during the late years of the [[Warring States period]].<ref name=\"Birthplace\"/> His parents' names were not recorded in history; they were simply referred to as \"[[Liu Taigong]]\" (\u5289\u592a\u516c; lit. \"Old Sir Liu\") and \"Liu Ao\" (\u5289\u5aaa;<ref>Note that the Chinese character \"\u5aaa\" (\u01ceo) was not the personal name of Liu's mother.

According to legend, before Liu Bang's birth, his mother was caught in a rainstorm and took shelter under a bridge. At that moment, lightning struck and the sky darkened. Liu Bang's father went to fetch his wife home and saw a dragon hovering above her. She became pregnant and later gave birth to Liu Bang.<ref name=\"iub.edu\">[http://www.iub.edu/~g380/4.3-Rise-2010.pdf Translation] of Sima Qian's ''Shiji''.</ref>\n\nIt was subsequently recorded that the young Liu Bang was outspoken, charismatic and of great generosity and forbearance. However, he enjoyed loafing, disliked reading, showed no interest in farming and [[manual labour]] and frequently ran into trouble with the law, hence his father often called him a \"little rascal\" for his lazy lifestyle. Liu Bang persisted in his idling ways and depended on his brother's family for food and lodging. When he grew older, he became a good friend and live-in companion of a former [[Retainers in early China (social group)|retainer]] of [[Lord Xinling]] named Zhang Er ({{zh|t=\u5f35\u8033}}, ? \u2014 202 BCE), who, at the time, was the [[county magistrate|magistrate]] of the nearby [[Minquan County|Waihuang County]].\n\nAfter Qin conquered Chu, Zhang Er went into hiding, and Liu Bang returned to his own home town in Pei County.  Contrary to other claims, he did not take any civil service exam as it did not exist yet at that time. Instead, he was later recommended and appointed as the local [[sheriff]] (\u4ead\u9577) at Sishui Pavilion (\u6cd7\u6c34\u4ead) in [[Pei County]], through the aid and supervision of his close friends [[Xiao He]] and [[Cao Shen]], who worked at the county office and often helped cover up his delinquent behaviour.  He nevertheless forged close relationships with most of the local county bureaucrats, and earned himself a small reputation in the district.  Liu Bang was once sent for [[statute labour]] in the capital [[Xianyang]], and encountered the [[First Emperor]] going on an inspection tour around the nation.  Awed by the majestic sight of the royal convoy, he exclaimed, \"Alas, this is how a great man should be! (\u55df\u4e4e\uff0c\u5927\u4e08\u592b\u7576\u5982\u6b64\u4e5f)\"\n\nOne day, L\u00fc Wen (\u5442\u6587), a wealthy and influential [[gentry]] from [[Shan County|Shanfu County]], who had recently moved to Pei County, was putting on a feast to host the local elites.  [[Xiao He]], who was in charge of helping L\u00fc Wen collect gifts from the visitors, announced that \"those who do not offer more than 1,000 coins worth of gifts shall be seated outside the hall\".  Liu Bang went to the feast without bringing any money but said, \"I offer 10,000 coins.\"  L\u00fc Wen saw Liu Bang and was so impressed with him on first sight, that he immediately stood up and welcomed Liu into the hall to sit beside him, despite Xiao He telling him that Liu Bang was not being serious.  L\u00fc Wen chatted with Liu Bang, and said, \"I used to predict fortunes for many people but I have never before seen someone so exceptional like you.\"  He then offered his daughter [[Empress L\u00fc Zhi|L\u00fc Zhi]]'s hand in marriage to Liu Bang.  After they were wed, L\u00fc Zhi bore Liu Bang a son Liu Ying (the future [[Emperor Hui of Han|Emperor Hui]]) and a daughter (the future [[Princess Yuan of Lu]]).\n\n==Insurrection against the Qin dynasty==\n[[File:Qin Uprisings.png|thumb|Uprisings of Qin Dynasty. Liu Bang's campaign is shown in purple.]]\n[[File:Liu Bang.jpg|thumb|Liu Bang, in an illustration by Qing-dynasty artist Shangguan Zhou \u4e0a\u5b98\u5468 (1665\u20131749)]]\nLiu Bang had been tasked with escorting a group of convicts to [[Mount Li]] where they would be put to work to help build the [[Mausoleum of the First Qin Emperor|First Emperor's mausoleum]]. A few prisoners managed to escape during the journey. Liu Bang began to fear for his life as having convicts escape under one's care was, under the laws of the ruling [[Qin_dynasty|Qin dynasty]], a capital offence. Realizing that to keep his life he'd have to flee, Liu Bang decided to release the remaining prisoners in his care. A few of these convicts were so grateful to be set free that they decided to join Liu Bang of their own accord.\n\nAccording to legend they encountered a gigantic white serpent which killed members of Liu Bang's group with its poisonous breath. It is said that while drunk, Liu Bang slew the serpent that night and later encountered an old woman weeping by the side of the road the next morning. When the men following Liu asked her why she was crying, she replied, \"My child, the White Emperor's son, has been slain by the son of the Red Emperor.\"  She then mysteriously disappeared. After hearing the old woman's strange words, Liu Bang's followers believed that he was destined to become a ruler in the future and became even more impressed with him. This event is known as the \"Uprising of the Slaying of the White Serpent\" ({{zh|t=\u65ac\u767d\u86c7\u8d77\u7fa9}}).<ref>{{cite web |last1=. |first1=\u4e09\u4e09\u4e24\u4e24 |title=\u5289\u90a6\u7684\u6210\u529f\u4e4b\u9053\uff0c\u70ba\u4ec0\u9ebc\u8d0f\u7684\u662f\u4ed6\uff1f |url=https://www.0-news.info/history/liubang-de-chenggong-zhi-dao/ |url=https://www.0-news.info/ |accessdate=21 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nLiu Bang and his followers took refuge on [[Mount Mangdang]] (in present-day [[Yongcheng]], [[Shangqiu]], [[Henan]]) and lived as outlaws in an abandoned stronghold. Liu had maintained secret contact with some of his old friends such as Xiao He and Cao Shen who still lived in Pei County. In 209&nbsp;BCE, two men named [[Chen Sheng]] and [[Wu Guang]] began the [[Dazexiang Uprising]] to overthrow the Qin dynasty. The magistrate of Pei County considered joining the rebellion as well and acting on the advice of both Xiao He and Cao Shen, he sent [[Fan Kuai]] (a relative of Liu Bang) to invite Liu and his followers back to Pei County to support him. However, he later decided against it and ended up denying Liu Bang entry into his lands. He also worried that Liu's friends Xiao He and Cao Shen might decide to open the gates for Liu now that he had been denied entry, so he set a plan in motion to kill them but Xiao and Cao managed to escape before it was put into action and eventually joined up with Liu and his entourage. While in Liu's company, Xiao came up with a plan to gain entry into the county and managed to convince Liu to take his advice. Liu Bang ordered his men to write letters, wrap them around their arrows and fire the arrows over the border and into the neighboring county from which they had been barred. In the letters they urged the local townsfolk to help him. The peasants responded to this call for aid by killing the magistrate and welcoming Liu back into Pei County. Liu Bang decided to style himself the \"Duke of Pei\" (\u6c9b\u516c) after this and became known to others by this title.\n\nIn 208 BCE, during the reign of [[Qin Er Shi]], the descendants of the former royal families who had ruled over the states of [[Yan (state)|Yan]], [[Zhao (state)|Zhao]], [[Qi (state)|Qi]] and [[Wei (state)|Wei]] rebelled against the Qin Empire in the hope of restoring their former kingdoms. All of which had been conquered by the Qin dynasty in [[Qin's wars of unification|a series of wars]] to unify China under one ruler (the later Qin Emperor) about two decades earlier. In the county of Wu (present-day [[Jiangsu]]), a commoner named [[Xiang Liang]] (whose father had been a general for the state of Chu during the wars of unification) began his own uprising and installed [[Emperor Yi of Chu|Xiong Xin]] as \"King Huai the Latter\" (\u695a\u5f8c\u61f7\u738b) on the throne of the former [[Chu (state)|Chu state]]. Liu Bang decided to join Xiang Liang's rebellion and served in Chu for some time. After Xiang Liang was killed in action at the Battle of Dingtao, King Huai II sent Xiang Liang's nephew [[Xiang Yu]] and minister [[Song Yi (Qin dynasty)|Song Yi]] to lead an army to reinforce the Zhao state, which was under attack by Qin forces.\n\nLiu Bang was later granted the title \"Marquis of Wu'an\" (\u6b66\u5b89\u4faf) by the king and tasked with leading an army which was to attack Qin. The king then promised that whoever entered [[Guanzhong]] (the heartland of the Qin state) first would receive the title \"King of Guanzhong\". In 206&nbsp;BCE, Liu Bang managed to beat Xiang Yu in the race to Guanzhong and arrived outside of the Qin capital. [[Ziying]] who would end up being the last ruler of the Qin dynasty, surrendered the capital city of [[Xianyang]] to Liu Bang's forces.  Liu issued strict orders to his men which forbade them from killing any innocent civilians or pillaging the city. Thanks to this, peace and stability were temporarily restored in Xianyang while Liu Bang's forces were stationed there. Liu's friend and confidante Xiao He ordered the collection of all the legal documents in the Qin palace and government facilities so they could be preserved and safely transported away.\n\n== Chu\u2013Han Contention ==\n{{Main|Chu\u2013Han Contention}}\n\n===Feast at Hong Gate===\n{{Main|Feast at Hong Gate}}\n[[File:Mural Painting of a Banquet Scene from the Han Dynasty Tomb of Ta-hu-t'ing.jpg|thumb|300px|A late [[Eastern Han]] (25\u2013220 AD) [[Chinese painting|Chinese tomb mural]] showing lively scenes of a banquet (yanyin \u5bb4\u98f2), dance and music (wuyue \u821e\u6a02), acrobatics (baixi \u767e\u620f), and wrestling (xiangbu \u76f8\u6251), [[c:Category:Dahuting Tomb murals|from the Dahuting Tomb]] (Chinese: \u6253\u864e\u4ead\u6f22\u5893, Pinyin: ''Dahuting Han mu''), on the southern bank of the [[Suihe River]] in [[Zhengzhou]], [[Henan province]], China (just west of [[Xi County, Henan|Xi County]])]]\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = 01 Wine vessel Western Han dynasty.jpg\n| width1 = 150\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Shanxi Museum 2009 Taiyuan 839.jpg\n| width2 = 182\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = '''Left:''' A [[jade]]-carved wine cup with [[relief]] decorations, [[Western Han]] (202 BCE \u2013 9 CE) <br>'''Right:''' a gilded bronze [[wine warmer]] with animalistic relief decorations, 26 BCE, [[Western Han]] period\n}}\n[[File:Met, female dancer, western han dynasty, 2nd century BC.JPG|thumb|upright|A [[Western Han]] female dancer in [[silk]] robes, 2nd century BC, [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]; [[Xiang Zhuang]] intended to assassinate Liu Bang by pretending to do a [[sword dance]]]]\n[[Xiang Yu]] was dissatisfied that Liu Bang had beat him in the race to [[Guanzhong]]. Instigated by his advisor [[Fan Zeng]] and Cao Wushang (\u66f9\u7121\u50b7), an informer from Liu Bang's camp, he decided to set a trap to kill Liu Bang.  He pretended to invite Liu Bang to a banquet, while secretly planning to assassinate Liu during the feast.  However, Xiang Yu's uncle, [[Xiang Bo]], was a close friend of Liu Bang's strategist [[Zhang Liang (Western Han)|Zhang Liang]], and managed to persuade his nephew to not personally order Liu Bang's execution on the feast.  Frustrated by Xiang Yu's indecisiveness, Fan Zeng then ordered Xiang Yu's cousin [[Xiang Zhuang]] to pretend performing a [[sword dance]] and use the opportunity to kill Liu Bang, but Xiang Bo volunteered to join the dance and blocked his nephew every time he thrust his sword towards Liu Bang.\n\nSeeing Liu Bang was in mortal danger, Zhang Liang sneaked outside and summoned Liu Bang's brother-in-law and personal bodyguard [[Fan Kuai]], who then crashed the party clad in full armor and scolded Xiang Yu for the sinister plot.  Embarrassed by Fan Kuai's accusation, Xiang Yu ordered the sword dance to stop and rewarded Fan Kuai for his bravery.  Liu Bang then pretended to go to the latrine and used the chance to escape Xiang Yu's camp unannounced.  He and his forces then evacuated from Xianyang and retreated west.  Xiang Yu led his forces into Xianyang, where they plundered and pillaged the city and burnt down the [[Epang Palace]].\n\n[[Records of the Grand Historian]] recounts an event during this conflict, an event omitted from the emperor's own biography but present in the biography of Xiang Yu, where he pushed his own children out of his carriage to lighten it in a desperate attempt to escape in a chase from Xiang Yu's men.{{sfnp|Watson|1958|pp=95\u201398}}\n\n===Conquest of the Three Qin===\nAfter occupying Xianyang, Xiang Yu proclaimed himself \"Hegemon-King of Western Chu\" and split the former Qin Empire into the [[Eighteen Kingdoms]]. The Guanzhong area, which was rightfully Liu Bang's per [[Emperor Yi of Chu|King Huai II]]'s earlier promise, was given by Xiang Yu to [[Three Qins|three former Qin generals]] instead. Liu Bang was relocated to [[Hanzhong]] in the remote Bashu region (in present-day [[Sichuan]]) and received the title \"King of Han\" (\u6f22\u738b). When a rebellion broke out in the [[Qi (state)|Qi kingdom]] in late 206&nbsp;BCE, Xiang Yu left Western Chu to suppress the revolt. Liu Bang used the opportunity to invade and conquer Guanzhong and then attack several Chu territories, including the capital Pengcheng (\u5f6d\u57ce; present-day [[Xuzhou]], [[Jiangsu]]).\n\n===Battle of Gaixia===\nFrom 206\u2013202&nbsp;BCE, Liu Bang engaged Xiang Yu in a power struggle \u2013 historically known as the [[Chu\u2013Han Contention]] \u2013 for supremacy over China, while simultaneously attacking and subjugating the other kingdoms. In 203&nbsp;BCE, Xiang Yu and Liu Bang came to an armistice, known as the Treaty of Hong Canal, which divided China into east and west along the Hong Canal under the Chu and Han regimes respectively. A few months later, Liu Bang renounced the treaty and attacked Xiang Yu again. In 202&nbsp;BCE, Xiang Yu lost to Liu Bang at the [[Battle of Gaixia]] and committed suicide, after which Chu surrendered to Han. Liu Bang had unified much of China under his control by then.\n\n==Establishment of the Han dynasty==\n[[File:Emperor gao of han c01s06i01.jpg|thumb|A portrait painting of Emperor Gao of Han (Liu Bang), from an 18th-century Qing Dynasty album of Chinese emperors' portraits.]]\nIn 202&nbsp;BCE, Liu Bang was enthroned as the emperor with support from his subjects even though he expressed reluctance to take the throne. He named his dynasty \"[[Han dynasty|Han]]\", and was historically known as \"Emperor Gaozu\" (or \"Emperor Gao\"). He established the capital in [[Luoyang]] (later moved to [[Chang'an]]) and instated his official spouse [[Empress L\u00fc Zhi|L\u00fc Zhi]] as the empress and their son [[Emperor Hui of Han|Liu Ying]] as the [[crown prince]].\n\nThe following year, Emperor Gaozu wanted to reward his subjects who had contributed to the founding of the Han Empire, but the process dragged on for a year because they could not agree on the distribution of the rewards. The emperor thought that [[Xiao He]]'s contributions were the greatest, so he awarded Xiao the title \"Marquis of Zan\" and gave him the largest amount of food stores. Some of the others expressed objections because they thought that Xiao was not directly involved in battle so his contributions should not be considered the greatest. Emperor Gaozu replied that Xiao He should receive the highest credit because he planned their overall strategy in the war against Xiang Yu. He named [[Cao Shen]] as the person who made the greatest contributions in battle and rewarded him and the others accordingly.\n\n==Reign==\n{{Further|Han dynasty}}\n\n===Reducing taxes and corv\u00e9e===\nEmperor Gaozu disbanded his armies and allowed the soldiers to return home. He gave an order stating that the people who remained in [[Guanzhong]] were exempted from taxes and [[corv\u00e9e]] for 12 years while those who returned to their respective native territories were exempted for six years and that the central government would provide for them for a year. He also granted freedom to those who had sold themselves into slavery to avoid hunger during the wars. In 195&nbsp;BCE, the emperor issued two decrees: the first officialised the lowering of taxes and corv\u00e9e; the second set the amount of tribute to be paid by the [[Kings of the Han dynasty|vassal kings]] to the imperial court in the 10th month of every year. The land tax on agricultural production was reduced to a rate of 1/15 of crop yield. He also privatised the coinage.\n\n===Emphasis on Confucianism===\nIn his early days, Emperor Gaozu disliked reading and scorned [[Confucianism]]. After becoming the emperor, he still held the same attitudes towards Confucianism as he did before until he encountered the scholar [[Lu Jia (Western Han)|Lu Jia]] (or Lu Gu). Lu Gu wrote a 12-volume book, ''Xinyu'' (\u65b0\u8a9e), which espoused the benefits of governing by moral virtue as opposed to using harsh and punitive laws (as it was under the Qin dynasty). Lu Gu read each volume to the emperor after he finished writing it. The emperor was deeply impressed. Under Emperor Gaozu's reign, Confucianism flourished and gradually replaced [[Legalism (philosophy)|Legalism]] (of Qin times) as the state ideology. Confucian scholars, including Lu Gu, were recruited to serve in the government. The emperor also reformed the legal system by relaxing some laws inherited from the Qin regime and reducing the severity of certain penalties. In 196&nbsp;BCE, after suppressing a rebellion by [[Ying Bu]], he passed by [[Shandong]], the birthplace of [[Confucius]], and personally prepared for a ceremony to pay respect to the philosopher.\n\n===Dispute over the succession===\nIn his later years, Emperor Gaozu favoured [[Concubine Qi]] and neglected [[Empress L\u00fc Zhi]]. He thought that [[Emperor Hui of Han|Liu Ying]], his heir apparent (born to the empress), was too weak to be a ruler. Thus, he had the intention of replacing Liu Ying with another son, [[Liu Ruyi]], who was born to Concubine Qi. L\u00fc Zhi became worried, so she asked [[Zhang Liang (Western Han)|Zhang Liang]] to help her son maintain his position. Zhang Liang recommended four reclusive wise men, the [[Four Whiteheads of Mount Shang]], to help Liu Ying.\n\nIn 195&nbsp;BCE as Emperor Gaozu's health started to worsen, he desired even more to replace Liu Ying with Liu Ruyi as the crown prince. Zhang Liang tried to dissuade him but was ignored, so he retired on the excuse that he was ill. [[Shusun Tong]] (the crown prince's tutor) and Zhou Chang also strongly objected to the emperor's decision to replace Liu Ying with Liu Ruyi. Zhou Chang said, \"I am not good in arguing, but I know this is not right. If Your Majesty deposes the Crown Prince, I won't follow your orders any more.\"<ref>(\u81e3\u53e3\u4e0d\u80fd\u8a00\uff0c\u7136\u81e3\u671f\u671f\u77e5\u5176\u4e0d\u53ef\u3002\u965b\u4e0b\u96d6\u6b32\u5ee2\u592a\u5b50\uff0c\u81e3\u671f\u671f\u4e0d\u5949\u8a54\u3002)</ref> Zhou Chang was outspoken but he had a stuttering problem, which made his speech very amusing. The emperor laughed. After that, the Four Haos of Mount Shang showed up in the court. Emperor Gaozu was surprised to see them because they had previously declined to join the civil service when he invited them. The four men promised to help Liu Ying in the future if he were to remain as the crown prince. The emperor was pleased to see that Liu Ying had their support so he dismissed the idea of changing his heir apparent.<ref name=\"Ch'en2014\">{{cite book|author=Chi-yen Ch'en|title=Hsun Yueh and the Mind of Late Han China: A Translation of the SHEN-CHIEN|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Sar_AwAAQBAJ&pg=PA171#v=onepage&q&f=false|date=14 July 2014|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-1-4008-5348-9|pages=171\u2013}}</ref>\n\n===Military campaigns===\n{{further|Kings of the Han dynasty|Battle of Baideng|Heqin}}\n[[File:Western Han soldiers.jpg|thumb|[[Horses in East Asian warfare|Cavalry soldiers]], painted [[Chinese ceramics|ceramic statues]], [[Western Han]] period, [[Hainan Provincial Museum]]]]\nAfter establishing the Han dynasty, Emperor Gaozu appointed princes and [[Kings of the Han dynasty|vassal kings]] to help him govern the Han Empire and gave each of them a piece of land. There were seven vassal kings who were not related to the imperial clan: [[Zang Tu]], the King of Yan; [[King Xin of Han|H\u00e1n Xin]], the King of H\u00e1n; [[Han Xin]], the King of Chu; [[Peng Yue]], the King of Liang; [[Ying Bu]], the King of Huainan; Zhang Er, the King of Zhao; [[Wu Rui (King of Changsha)|Wu Rui]], the King of Changsha. However, later, the emperor became worried that the vassal kings might rebel against him because they, after all, had no blood relations with him. Han Xin and Peng Yue were (falsely) accused of treason, arrested and executed along with their families. Ying Bu and Zang Tu rebelled against him but were defeated and killed. Only Wu Rui and Zhang Er were left.\n\nThe [[Xiongnu]] in the north had been a threat since the [[Qin dynasty]]. [[Qin Shi Huang]] had sent the general [[Meng Tian]] to oversee the defences on the Qin Empire's northern border and the construction of the [[Great Wall of China|Great Wall]] to repel the invaders. Meng Tian achieved success in deterring the Xiongnu from advancing beyond the border. However, after the Qin dynasty collapsed, the Xiongnu seized the opportunity to move south and raid the border again. In 201&nbsp;BCE, H\u00e1n Xin (King of H\u00e1n) defected to the Xiongnu leader, [[Modu Chanyu|Modu]]. In the following year, Emperor Gaozu led an army to attack the Xiongnu but was besieged and trapped by the enemy at the [[Battle of Baideng]]. Acting on [[Chen Ping (Han dynasty)|Chen Ping]]'s advice, he bribed Modu's wife with gifts and got her to ask her husband to withdraw his forces. Modu did so. After returning to the capital, Emperor Gaozu initiated the policy of ''[[heqin]]'', which involved sending noble ladies to marry the Xiongnu leaders and paying annual tribute to the Xiongnu in exchange for peace between the Han Empire and the Xiongnu.\n\n{{-}}\n\n==Death==\n[[File:Changling 1.jpg|thumb|Changling (\u9577\u9675), [[Chinese pyramids|the tomb]] of Emperor Gaozu in Xianyang, Shaanxi.]]\n\nEmperor Gaozu was wounded by a stray arrow during the campaign against [[Ying Bu]]. He became seriously ill and remained in his inner chambers for a long period of time and ordered his guards to deny entry to everyone who tried to visit him. After several days, [[Fan Kuai]] barged into the chambers to see the emperor and the other subjects followed behind him. They saw Emperor Gaozu lying on his bed and attended to by a [[eunuch]]. Fan Kuai said, \"How glorious it was when Your Majesty first led us to conquer the empire and how weary we are now. Your subjects are worried when they learn that Your Majesty is ill, but Your Majesty refuses to see us and prefers the company of a eunuch instead. Has Your Majesty forgotten the incident about [[Zhao Gao]]?\" The emperor laughed and got out of bed to meet his subjects.\n\nEmperor Gaozu's health deteriorated later so [[Empress L\u00fc Zhi]] hired a famous physician to heal him. When Emperor Gaozu enquired about his condition, the physician told him that his illness could be cured, but the emperor was displeased and he scolded the physician, \"Isn't it Heaven's will that I managed to conquer this empire in simple clothing and with nothing but a sword? My life is determined by Heaven. It is useless even if [[Bian Que]] is here!\" He refused to continue with the treatment and sent the physician away. Before his death, he said that [[Cao Shen]] could succeed [[Xiao He]] as the [[Chancellor (China)|chancellor]] after Xiao died, and that Wang Ling could succeed Cao Shen. He also said that Wang Ling might be too young to perform his duties so [[Chen Ping (Han dynasty)|Chen Ping]] could assist Wang, but Chen was also qualified to assume the responsibilities of a chancellor all by himself. He also named [[Zhou Bo]] as a possible candidate for the role of Grand Commandant. He died in Changle Palace (\u9577\u6a02\u5bae) on 1 June 195&nbsp;BCE and was succeeded by Liu Ying, who became historically known as [[Emperor Hui of Han|Emperor Hui]].\n\n== Song of the Great Wind ==\nThe ''Song of the Great Wind'' was a song composed by Liu Bang in 195&nbsp;BCE when he visited his hometown in [[Pei County]] after suppressing [[Ying Bu]]'s rebellion. He prepared a banquet and invited all his old friends and townsfolk to join him. After some drinks, Liu Bang played the [[guqin]] and sang the ''Song of the Great Wind''.<ref>{{in lang|zh}} [http://www.guoxue.com/art/ss000/hvsc001/dfg005.htm \u5927\u98ce\u6b4c]</ref>\n\n{| border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"0\"\n|-\n| style=\"font-size:100%\" |\n'''\u300a\u5927\u98a8\u6b4c\u300b'''\n|\n'''Song of the Great Wind'''\n|-\n| style=\"font-size:100%\" |\n\u5927\u98a8\u8d77\u516e\u96f2\u98db\u63da\uff0c\n|\n''A great wind came forth,''<br />\n''the clouds rose on high''.\n|-\n| style=\"font-size:100%\" |\n\u5a01\u52a0\u6d77\u5167\u516e\u6b78\u6545\u9109\uff0c\n|\n''Now that my might rules all within the seas,''<br />\n''I have returned to my old village''.\n|-\n| style=\"font-size:100%\" |\n\u5b89\u5f97\u731b\u58eb\u516e\u5b88\u56db\u65b9\uff01\n|\n''Where will I find brave men''<br />\n''to guard the four corners of my land?''\n|}\n\n<ref>{{cite book| author = John Minford|author2=Joseph S.

WJW was the flagship of a six-station Ohio network that carried the games in 1947 and 1948, a precursor to the current [[Cleveland Indians Radio Network]]. However, the full games were often carried on WJW-FM, since the AM outlet did not have available air time due to its ABC network commitments. As a result, Cleveland became an FM hot bed, and more FM radio sets sold in Cleveland than in any other market in the country in 1948;<ref name=\"radio_encyclopedia\">{{cite book|author1=Van Tassel, David D. |author2=Grabowski, John J. |year=1996|title=The Encyclopedia of Cleveland History|publisher=Indiana University Press|location=Bloomington, IN|edition=2nd|isbn=978-0-25333-056-7}}</ref> a 14-station extension of the Indians Radio Network, The Standard Network, was soon established with WJW-FM as its flagship.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MewDAAAAMBAJ|title=Standard Net Begins Origination at WJW|last=|first=|date=1948-12-04|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|The Billboard]]|access-date=2019-12-16}}</ref>\n\nO'Neil sold WJW and WJW-FM to [[Storer Broadcasting]] on November 17, 1954.

Within two years, radio and television operations were consolidated at new studios at 1630 Euclid Avenue, near Playhouse Square, in a remodeled Georgian building that formerly housed the Esquire Theater.  WJW dropped its ABC Radio Network affiliation at the end of 1957 and became an independent station,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC/BC-1958/1958-01-20-BC.pdf|title=WSRS Becomes ABN's 303rd|last=|first=|date=January 20, 1958|work=[[Broadcasting & Cable|Broadcasting]]|access-date=December 23, 2019|url-status=live|page=82}}</ref> although the station later had a brief affiliation with [[NBC]] before becoming independent again.  By 1959, WJW broadcast with 10,000 watts daytime and 5,000 watts at night, which would last for the next forty years.\n\n====Alan Freed====\nA young disc jockey named [[Alan Freed]] joined WJW in 1951 from [[WAKR]] in [[Akron, Ohio|Akron]], [[Ohio]].  Shortly thereafter, Alan began making broadcasting history with his shows in which he was known as the \"Moondog.\" Freed played rhythm-and-blues music by black artists for a largely white teen-age audience. He is purported to have given the music the name by which it is known today &ndash; [[rock and roll]].\n\nIn addition to his radio program, Freed also organized local concerts by early rock artists, called the [[Moondog Coronation Ball]], which many consider to be the first rock concert in American history.  The concert on March 21, 1952 at the Cleveland Arena turned into a riot when far too many listeners filled the hall, causing Freed to apologize on the air the next day.\n\nFreed left WJW in September 1954 for [[WINS (AM)|WINS]] New York, but he had established WJW as the premier rock and roll outlet.<ref>{{cite web|year=2010|title=Alan Freed Biography|url=http://www.alanfreed.com/wp/biography/|work=AlanFreed.com|publisher=Judith Fisher Freed|accessdate=April 29, 2007}}</ref>\n\n====Pete \"Mad Daddy\" Myers====\nIn January 1958, Pete \"Mad Daddy\" Myers joined the station from [[WHLO|WHKK]] 640 AM in Akron.  His \"Mad Daddy\" persona later was adapted by [[Ernie Anderson]] for his \"[[Ghoulardi]]\" character on sister station [[WJW-TV]] in 1963.  Myers' show was heard nightly from 8 pm to 12:30 am.  Myers had a brief but meteoric career at WJW, lasting only until May 13, 1958, when he resigned to go to [[Metromedia]]'s [[WHK (AM)|WHK]] which was establishing itself as the new Top 40 powerhouse in Cleveland.\n\nWJW enforced a 90-day noncompete clause, and \"Mad Daddy\" could not be heard on WHK until August 10.  To keep his name in front of the public while he was off the air, Myers concocted a publicity stunt on June 14, 1958, parachuting from a Piper Cub 2200 feet over Lake Erie, and composing a poem on his way down.\n\nHe was fished out the waters shortly thereafter, and handed out copies of the 45 record \"Zorro\" to hundreds of fans who greeted him when he got to shore. Some initial reports of the stunt incorrectly stated that Myers did not survive the jump, but they were quickly revised.\n\n\"Mad Daddy\" reached the peak of his popularity at WHK, hosting record hops and live after-midnight shows dressed in a Dracula costume.  In July 1959 he moved to [[WHK (AM)|WHK]]'s sister station in New York, [[WBBR|WNEW]] 1130 AM, where \"Mad Daddy\" was not well received.  He played it straight as Pete Myers there until 1963, when he moved to [[WINS (AM)|WINS]] and resumed the \"Mad Daddy Show.\"  This show was syndicated to other stations until WINS changed format to all-news in 1965.\n\nAs again just Pete Myers, he returned to WNEW once more.  Myers lived until October 4, 1968, when he took his own life in New York City, shortly after he had been informed that his show was to be moved from afternoons to evenings at [[WBBR|WNEW]].<ref name=\"WJW archives\"/><ref>{{cite web|author=Hinkley, David|date=April 7, 2005|title=Man Out of Time: Mad Daddy|url=http://wnew1130.com/pete_myers.shtml|work=[[Daily News (New York)|New York Daily News]] via WNEW1130.com|publisher=WNEW1130.com|accessdate=January 1, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091015143451/http://www.wnew1130.com/pete_myers.shtml|archivedate=October 15, 2009}}</ref>\n\n====Later years====\nAfter losing both Freed and Myers in successive fashion, WJW turned to a young [[Casey Kasem]], then known on-air as \"Casey at the Mike\", for the evening shift.

Soon, however, the local new WKNR on-air hosts included the midday team of Greg Brinda and Kendall Lewis; Kenny Roda; [[Bruce Drennan]]; the late John Antus; Bob Karlovec; and Ken Silverstein.  The station's program director at the time was Steve Legurski, who had held the same post at {{nowrap|[[WHKW|WKNR (1220 AM)]]}} from 1999 to 2001.\n\nA series of budget cutbacks by Salem in January 2004 led to the dismissal of Brinda, Lewis, Silverstein, Legurski and several other staffers, with Micheal Luczak taking over as program director.  Bruce Drennan was reassigned to the midday slot, while [[ESPN Radio]]'s flagship program ''[[Mike and Mike in the Morning]]'' took Drennan's place.  Greg Brinda was then brought back to the station one week after his dismissal to do fill-in work and host several specialty shows, but wound up taking Drennan's slot following his sudden departure in October 2004.\n\nA number of divestures and format changes with other Salem-owned sports talk stations in the past few years (such as [[WDJO|WBOB]] in [[Cincinnati]] and [[KHHO]] in [[Tacoma, Washington|Tacoma]], which was [[Local marketing agreement|LMA]]'ed to [[Clear Channel Communications|Clear Channel]]) left WKNR the only remaining sports station in [[Salem Communications]]' portfolio.\n\nIn July 2006, ESPN Radio cancelled its affiliation with WKNR with a 90-day notice effective that October 8, following [[Beaver Dam, Wisconsin]]-based Good Karma Broadcasting's purchase of WABQ and new affiliation deal. With that change, WKNR then became the Cleveland affiliate for [[Fox Sports Radio]] that October,<ref>{{cite news\n |last         = Brown\n |first        = Roger\n |title        = With Rosburg, Browns are special\n |page         = 4\n |publisher    = [[The Plain Dealer]]\n |date         = 2006-10-06\n |url          = http://www.cleveland.com/sports/plaindealer/roger_brown/index.ssf?/base/sports/1160123448197870.xml&coll=2&thispage=4\n |accessdate   = 2006-10-08\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20110607121347/http://www.cleveland.com/sports/plaindealer/roger_brown/index.ssf?%2Fbase%2Fsports%2F1160123448197870.xml&coll=2&thispage=4\n |archive-date = 2011-06-07\n |url-status     = dead\n}}</ref> while WABQ relaunched as \"ESPN Radio 1540\" [[WWGK]].

WJW was the flagship of a six-station Ohio network that carried the games in 1947 and 1948, a precursor to the current [[Cleveland Indians Radio Network]]. However, the full games were often carried on WJW-FM, since the AM outlet did not have available air time due to its ABC network commitments. As a result, Cleveland became an FM hot bed, and more FM radio sets sold in Cleveland than in any other market in the country in 1948;<ref name=\"radio_encyclopedia\">{{cite book|author1=Van Tassel, David D. |author2=Grabowski, John J. |year=1996|title=The Encyclopedia of Cleveland History|publisher=Indiana University Press|location=Bloomington, IN|edition=2nd|isbn=978-0-25333-056-7}}</ref> a 14-station extension of the Indians Radio Network, The Standard Network, was soon established with WJW-FM as its flagship.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MewDAAAAMBAJ|title=Standard Net Begins Origination at WJW|last=|first=|date=1948-12-04|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|The Billboard]]|access-date=2019-12-16}}</ref>\n\nO'Neil sold WJW and WJW-FM to [[Storer Broadcasting]] on November 17, 1954.

Within two years, radio and television operations were consolidated at new studios at 1630 Euclid Avenue, near Playhouse Square, in a remodeled Georgian building that formerly housed the Esquire Theater.  WJW dropped its ABC Radio Network affiliation at the end of 1957 and became an independent station,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-BC/BC-1958/1958-01-20-BC.pdf|title=WSRS Becomes ABN's 303rd|last=|first=|date=January 20, 1958|work=[[Broadcasting & Cable|Broadcasting]]|access-date=December 23, 2019|url-status=live|page=82}}</ref> although the station later had a brief affiliation with [[NBC]] before becoming independent again.  By 1959, WJW broadcast with 10,000 watts daytime and 5,000 watts at night, which would last for the next forty years.\n\n====Alan Freed====\nA young disc jockey named [[Alan Freed]] joined WJW in 1951 from [[WAKR]] in [[Akron, Ohio|Akron]], [[Ohio]].  Shortly thereafter, Alan began making broadcasting history with his shows in which he was known as the \"Moondog.\" Freed played rhythm-and-blues music by black artists for a largely white teen-age audience. He is purported to have given the music the name by which it is known today &ndash; [[rock and roll]].\n\nIn addition to his radio program, Freed also organized local concerts by early rock artists, called the [[Moondog Coronation Ball]], which many consider to be the first rock concert in American history.  The concert on March 21, 1952 at the Cleveland Arena turned into a riot when far too many listeners filled the hall, causing Freed to apologize on the air the next day.\n\nFreed left WJW in September 1954 for [[WINS (AM)|WINS]] New York, but he had established WJW as the premier rock and roll outlet.<ref>{{cite web|year=2010|title=Alan Freed Biography|url=http://www.alanfreed.com/wp/biography/|work=AlanFreed.com|publisher=Judith Fisher Freed|accessdate=April 29, 2007}}</ref>\n\n====Pete \"Mad Daddy\" Myers====\nIn January 1958, Pete \"Mad Daddy\" Myers joined the station from [[WHLO|WHKK]] 640 AM in Akron.  His \"Mad Daddy\" persona later was adapted by [[Ernie Anderson]] for his \"[[Ghoulardi]]\" character on sister station [[WJW-TV]] in 1963.  Myers' show was heard nightly from 8 pm to 12:30 am.  Myers had a brief but meteoric career at WJW, lasting only until May 13, 1958, when he resigned to go to [[Metromedia]]'s [[WHK (AM)|WHK]] which was establishing itself as the new Top 40 powerhouse in Cleveland.\n\nWJW enforced a 90-day noncompete clause, and \"Mad Daddy\" could not be heard on WHK until August 10.  To keep his name in front of the public while he was off the air, Myers concocted a publicity stunt on June 14, 1958, parachuting from a Piper Cub 2200 feet over Lake Erie, and composing a poem on his way down.\n\nHe was fished out the waters shortly thereafter, and handed out copies of the 45 record \"Zorro\" to hundreds of fans who greeted him when he got to shore. Some initial reports of the stunt incorrectly stated that Myers did not survive the jump, but they were quickly revised.\n\n\"Mad Daddy\" reached the peak of his popularity at WHK, hosting record hops and live after-midnight shows dressed in a Dracula costume.  In July 1959 he moved to [[WHK (AM)|WHK]]'s sister station in New York, [[WBBR|WNEW]] 1130 AM, where \"Mad Daddy\" was not well received.  He played it straight as Pete Myers there until 1963, when he moved to [[WINS (AM)|WINS]] and resumed the \"Mad Daddy Show.\"  This show was syndicated to other stations until WINS changed format to all-news in 1965.\n\nAs again just Pete Myers, he returned to WNEW once more.  Myers lived until October 4, 1968, when he took his own life in New York City, shortly after he had been informed that his show was to be moved from afternoons to evenings at [[WBBR|WNEW]].<ref name=\"WJW archives\"/><ref>{{cite web|author=Hinkley, David|date=April 7, 2005|title=Man Out of Time: Mad Daddy|url=http://wnew1130.com/pete_myers.shtml|work=[[Daily News (New York)|New York Daily News]] via WNEW1130.com|publisher=WNEW1130.com|accessdate=January 1, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091015143451/http://www.wnew1130.com/pete_myers.shtml|archivedate=October 15, 2009}}</ref>\n\n====Later years====\nAfter losing both Freed and Myers in successive fashion, WJW turned to a young [[Casey Kasem]], then known on-air as \"Casey at the Mike\", for the evening shift.
