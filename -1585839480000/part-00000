The origin of the name ''Niger'', which originally applied only to the middle reaches of the Niger River, is uncertain. The word is likely an alteration of the [[Tuareg people|Tuareg]] name ''egerew <u>n-iger</u>ewen''  used by inhabitants along the middle reaches of the river around [[Timbuktu]] prior to 19th-century European colonialism.<ref>The Arabic name ''nahr al-anhur'' is a direct translation of the Tuareg.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=Niger |title=''Online Etymological Dictionary'' |publisher=Etymonline.com |date= |accessdate=28 July 2014}}</ref>\n\n== History ==\n{{Main|History of Nigeria|Timeline of Nigerian history}}\n[[File:Intricate bronze ceremonial pot, 9th century, Igbo-Ukwu, Nigeria.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|Ceremonial Igbo pot from 9th-century [[Igbo-Ukwu]]]]\n\n=== Early (1,500 BC \u2013 1500) ===\n{{Further|History of Nigeria before 1500}}\n[[File:Nok sculpture Louvre 70-1998-11-1.jpg|thumb|[[Nok]] sculpture, [[terracotta]]]]\nThe [[Nok culture|Nok civilisation]] of [[Northern Nigeria]] flourished between 1,500 BC and AD 200.

Cities in the area became regional centres in a broad network of trade routes that spanned western, central and northern Africa. In the 16th century, [[Portuguese explorers]] were the first Europeans to begin significant, direct trade with peoples of modern-day Nigeria, at the port they named [[Lagos]] and in [[Calabar]].

The Atlantic slave trade was engaged in by European companies until it was outlawed in 1807.  After that illegal smugglers purchased slaves along the coast by native slavers. Britain's [[West Africa Squadron]] sought to intercept the smugglers at sea. The rescued slaves were taken to [[Freetown]], a colony in West Africa originally established for the resettlement of freed slaves from Britain. Britain intervened in the Lagos Kingship power struggle by bombarding Lagos in 1851, deposing the slave trade friendly Oba Kosoko, helping to install the amenable Oba [[Akitoye]], and signing the [[Treaty Between Great Britain and Lagos, 1 January 1852|Treaty between Great Britain and Lagos]] on 1 January 1852. Britain annexed Lagos as a Crown Colony in August 1861 with the [[Lagos Treaty of Cession]]. British missionaries expanded their operations and travelled further inland.

The following year, it chartered the [[Royal Niger Company]] under the leadership of Sir [[George Taubman Goldie]]. In 1900 the company's territory came under the control of the British government, which moved to consolidate its hold over the area of modern Nigeria. On 1 January 1901, Nigeria became a British [[protectorate]], and part of the [[British Empire]], the foremost world power at the time. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the independent kingdoms of what would become Nigeria fought a number of conflicts against the British Empire's efforts to expand its territory. By war, the British conquered [[Benin Empire|Benin]] in 1897, and, in the [[Anglo-Aro War]] (1901\u20131902), defeated other opponents. The restraint or conquest of these states opened up the Niger area to British rule.  In 1914, the British formally united the Niger area as the ''Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria''. Administratively, Nigeria remained divided into the [[Northern Nigeria|Northern]] and [[Southern Nigeria Protectorate|Southern]] Protectorates and [[Lagos Colony]]. Inhabitants of the southern region sustained more interaction, economic and cultural, with the British and other Europeans owing to the coastal economy.<ref>Toyin Falola and Matthew M.

With the fall of oil prices during the [[1980s oil glut]] Nigeria struggled to keep up with its loan payments and eventually defaulted on its principal debt repayments, limiting repayment to the interest portion of the loans. Arrears and penalty interest accumulated on the unpaid principal, which increased the size of the debt. After negotiations by the Nigerian authorities, in October 2005 Nigeria and its [[Paris Club]] creditors reached an agreement under which Nigeria repurchased its debt at a discount of approximately 60%. Nigeria used part of its oil profits to pay the residual 40%, freeing up at least $1.15&nbsp;billion annually for poverty reduction programmes.

The French spoken in Nigeria may be mixed with some native languages but is mostly spoken like the French spoken in Benin. French may also be mixed with English as it is in Cameroon.\n\nThe major languages spoken in Nigeria represent three major families of [[languages of Africa]]: the majority are [[Niger\u2013Congo languages|Niger-Congo]] languages, such as [[Igbo language|Igbo]], [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]], [[Ijaw language|Ijaw]], [[Fulfulde]], [[Ogoni language|Ogoni]], and [[Edo language|Edo]]. [[Kanuri language|Kanuri]], spoken in the northeast, primarily in [[Borno State|Borno]] and [[Yobe State]], is part of the [[Nilo-Saharan]] family, and [[Hausa language|Hausa]] is an [[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic]] language.\n\nEven though most ethnic groups prefer to communicate in their own languages, English as the official language is widely used for education, business transactions and for official purposes. English as a first language is used only by a small minority of the country's urban elite, and it is not spoken at all in some rural areas. Hausa is the most widely spoken of the three main languages spoken in Nigeria itself.\n\nWith the majority of Nigeria's populace in the rural areas, the major languages of communication in the country remain indigenous languages. Some of the largest of these, notably Yoruba and Igbo, have derived standardised languages from a number of different dialects and are widely spoken by those ethnic groups. [[Nigerian Pidgin English]], often known simply as \"[[Pidgin]]\" or \"Broken\" (Broken English), is also a popular [[lingua franca]], though with varying regional influences on dialect and slang. The pidgin English or Nigerian English is widely spoken within the [[Niger Delta]] Regions, predominantly in [[Warri]], [[Sapele, Delta|Sapele]], [[Port Harcourt]], [[Agenebode]], [[Ewu]], and [[Benin City]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Multilingualism: A Nigerian Case Study |first=Efurosibina E. |last=Adegbija |publisher=Africa World Press |year=2003 |isbn=978-1-59221-173-9 |page=55 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=auI_WuBrWncC&pg=PA55 |location=Last paragraph |accessdate=26 December 2008}}</ref>\n\n===Religion===\n{{Main|Religion in Nigeria}}\n{{Pie chart\n|thumb = right\n|caption = Religion in Nigeria (2013)<ref name=\"Cia 19\">CIA Factbook : Nigeria [https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ni.html] (Retrieved 1 May 2019)</ref>\n\n|label1 = [[Islam]]\n|value1 = 51.6\n|color1 = Green\n|label2 = [[Christianity]]\n|value2 = 47\n|color2 = DodgerBlue\n|label3 = [[Traditional African religions]]\n|value3 = 1.4\n|color3 = White\n}}\n\nNigeria is a religiously diverse society, with [[Christianity]] and [[Islam]] being the most widely professed religions.

The Atlantic slave trade was engaged in by European companies until it was outlawed in 1807.  After that illegal smugglers purchased slaves along the coast by native slavers. Britain's [[West Africa Squadron]] sought to intercept the smugglers at sea. The rescued slaves were taken to [[Freetown]], a colony in West Africa originally established for the resettlement of freed slaves from Britain. Britain intervened in the Lagos Kingship power struggle by bombarding Lagos in 1851, deposing the slave trade friendly Oba Kosoko, helping to install the amenable Oba [[Akitoye]], and signing the [[Treaty Between Great Britain and Lagos, 1 January 1852|Treaty between Great Britain and Lagos]] on 1 January 1852. Britain annexed Lagos as a Crown Colony in August 1861 with the [[Lagos Treaty of Cession]]. British missionaries expanded their operations and travelled further inland.

The following year, it chartered the [[Royal Niger Company]] under the leadership of Sir [[George Taubman Goldie]]. In 1900 the company's territory came under the control of the British government, which moved to consolidate its hold over the area of modern Nigeria. On 1 January 1901, Nigeria became a British [[protectorate]], and part of the [[British Empire]], the foremost world power at the time. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, the independent kingdoms of what would become Nigeria fought a number of conflicts against the British Empire's efforts to expand its territory. By war, the British conquered [[Benin Empire|Benin]] in 1897, and, in the [[Anglo-Aro War]] (1901\u20131902), defeated other opponents. The restraint or conquest of these states opened up the Niger area to British rule.  In 1914, the British formally united the Niger area as the ''Colony and Protectorate of Nigeria''. Administratively, Nigeria remained divided into the [[Northern Nigeria|Northern]] and [[Southern Nigeria Protectorate|Southern]] Protectorates and [[Lagos Colony]]. Inhabitants of the southern region sustained more interaction, economic and cultural, with the British and other Europeans owing to the coastal economy.<ref>Toyin Falola and Matthew M.

With the fall of oil prices during the [[1980s oil glut]] Nigeria struggled to keep up with its loan payments and eventually defaulted on its principal debt repayments, limiting repayment to the interest portion of the loans. Arrears and penalty interest accumulated on the unpaid principal, which increased the size of the debt. After negotiations by the Nigerian authorities, in October 2005 Nigeria and its [[Paris Club]] creditors reached an agreement under which Nigeria repurchased its debt at a discount of approximately 60%. Nigeria used part of its oil profits to pay the residual 40%, freeing up at least $1.15&nbsp;billion annually for poverty reduction programmes. Nigeria made history in April 2006 by becoming the first African country to completely pay off its debt (estimated $30&nbsp;billion) owed to the Paris Club.\n\nNigeria is trying to reach the first of the [[Sustainable Development Goals]], which is to [[Ending poverty in all its forms everywhere|end poverty]] in all its forms by 2030.\n\n=== Agriculture ===\n{{Further|Agriculture in Nigeria}}\n[[File:Farm Ploughing, Kwara State, Nigeria.jpg|thumb|Farm ploughing in [[Kwara State]]]]\n{{As of|2010}}, about 30% of Nigerians are employed in agriculture.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nigerianstat.gov.ng/pages/download/41 |title=Labour Force Statistics, 2010 |publisher=Nigerian Bureau of Statistics |date=2010 |accessdate=22 June 2015 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150424153316/http://www.nigerianstat.gov.ng/pages/download/41 |archivedate=24 April 2015}}</ref> Agriculture used to be the principal foreign exchange earner of Nigeria.<ref>{{cite book |title=Democracy and Development in Africa |first=Claude |last=Ake |publisher=Brookings Institution Press |year=1996 |isbn=978-0-8157-0220-7 |page=48 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=bs5rTH7GClgC&pg=PA48 |accessdate=26 December 2008}}</ref>\n\nMajor crops include [[beans]], [[sesame]], [[cashew nuts]], [[cassava]], [[cocoa beans]], [[Bambara groundnut|groundnuts]], [[gum arabic]],  kolanut, [[maize]] (corn), [[melon]], [[millet]], [[palm kernel]]s, [[palm oil]], [[Plantain (cooking)|plantains]], [[rice]], [[rubber]], [[sorghum]], [[soybeans]] and [[Yam (vegetable)|yams]].<ref name=\"Nigeria agriculture\">{{cite web|url=http://www.nationsencyclopedia.com/Africa/Nigeria-AGRICULTURE.html|title=Agriculture \u2013 Nigeria \u2013 export, growth, area, crops, farming, sector|publisher=|accessdate=17 April 2015}}</ref> [[Cocoa bean|Cocoa]] is the leading non-oil foreign exchange earner.<ref name=\"Nigeria agriculture\"/> [[Rubber]] is the second-largest non-oil foreign exchange earner.<ref name=\"Nigeria agriculture\"/>\n\nPrior to the [[Nigerian civil war]], Nigeria was self-sufficient in food.<ref name=\"Nigeria agriculture\"/> Agriculture has failed to keep pace with Nigeria's rapid population growth, and Nigeria now relies upon food imports to sustain itself.<ref name=\"Nigeria agriculture\"/> The Nigerian government promoted the use of inorganic fertilizers in the 1970s.<ref name=\"pasquini\">{{cite journal|last=Pasquini|first=MW|last2=Alexander|first2=MJ|date=2005|title=Soil fertility management strategies on the Jos Plateau: the need for integrating 'empirical' and 'scientific' knowledge in agricultural development|journal=Geographical Journal|volume=171|issue=2|pages=112\u2013124|doi=10.1111/j.1475-4959.2005.00154.x}}</ref> In August 2019, Nigeria closed its border with Benin to stop rice smuggling into the country as part of efforts to boost the local production.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://af.reuters.com/article/topNews/idAFKCN1VJ0PH-OZATP|title=Nigeria closes part of border with Benin to check rice smuggling|date=29 August 2019|work=Reuters|access-date=29 August 2019|language=en}}</ref>\n\n\n=== Ecology ===\nNigeria is greatly endowed with numerous tree species of which the majority of them are native while few are exotic.

It was launched on 13 May 2007, aboard a Chinese [[Long March 3B]] [[carrier rocket]], from the [[Xichang Satellite Launch Centre]] in [[China]]. The spacecraft was operated by [[NigComSat]] and the Nigerian Space Agency, [[NASRDA]]. On 11 November 2008, NigComSat-1 failed in orbit after running out of power because of an anomaly in its solar array. It was based on the Chinese [[DFH-4]] [[satellite bus]], and carries a variety of [[transponder]]s: 4 [[C band (IEEE)|C-band]]; 14 [[Ku-band]]; 8 [[Ka-band]]; and 2 [[L-band]]. It was designed to provide coverage to many parts of Africa, and the Ka-band transponders would also cover Italy.\n\nOn 10 November 2008 (0900 GMT), the satellite was reportedly switched off for analysis and to avoid a possible collision with other satellites.

The official language of Nigeria, English, was chosen to facilitate the cultural and linguistic unity of the country, owing to the influence of [[Colonial Nigeria|British colonisation]] that ended in 1960.\n\nMany French speakers from surrounding countries have influenced the English spoken in the border regions of Nigeria and some Nigerian citizens have become fluent enough in French to work in the surrounding countries. The French spoken in Nigeria may be mixed with some native languages but is mostly spoken like the French spoken in Benin. French may also be mixed with English as it is in Cameroon.\n\nThe major languages spoken in Nigeria represent three major families of [[languages of Africa]]: the majority are [[Niger\u2013Congo languages|Niger-Congo]] languages, such as [[Igbo language|Igbo]], [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]], [[Ijaw language|Ijaw]], [[Fulfulde]], [[Ogoni language|Ogoni]], and [[Edo language|Edo]]. [[Kanuri language|Kanuri]], spoken in the northeast, primarily in [[Borno State|Borno]] and [[Yobe State]], is part of the [[Nilo-Saharan]] family, and [[Hausa language|Hausa]] is an [[Afroasiatic languages|Afroasiatic]] language.\n\nEven though most ethnic groups prefer to communicate in their own languages, English as the official language is widely used for education, business transactions and for official purposes. English as a first language is used only by a small minority of the country's urban elite, and it is not spoken at all in some rural areas. Hausa is the most widely spoken of the three main languages spoken in Nigeria itself.\n\nWith the majority of Nigeria's populace in the rural areas, the major languages of communication in the country remain indigenous languages. Some of the largest of these, notably Yoruba and Igbo, have derived standardised languages from a number of different dialects and are widely spoken by those ethnic groups.

Founded in 1995 in [[Cherry Hill, New Jersey|Cherry Hill]], it moved to its Somerdale location in 2012. It is today the largest brewery in New Jersey.\n\n==History==\nFlying Fish was established in 1995 as the world\u2019s first virtual [[microbrewery]], something novel that drew a lot of attention. Flying Fish sold their product completely over the internet and shipped it to the customers location. Capitalizing on this early notoriety, founder Gene Muller took Flying Fish into brick and mortar, constructing the first microbrewery in South Jersey. Following his success online, Muller partnered with Andrew Newell to help secure funding for a permanent establishment. While New Jersey once boasted more than 50 breweries, Flying Fish was the first new brewery built in Southern New Jersey in more than 50 years.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nAfter opening in 1996, Flying Fish hit financial trouble due to a \"craft brewing bubble\" that popped. Many of the craft breweries closed down due to lack of profit and over saturation of the market. With this level of competition, Muller recalls the time as very difficult to stay afloat.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://digital.hagley.org/Gene_Muller_1_29_16?solr_nav%5Bid%5D=e7f0aea79b436e9fbfce&solr_nav%5Bpage%5D=0&solr_nav%5Boffset%5D=1|title=Interview with Gene Muller, 2016 January 29 {{!}} Hagley Digital Archives|website=digital.hagley.org|access-date=2018-12-10}}</ref> Flying Fish was able to gain more funding so it could buy a larger volume of packaging, making their pricing more competitive in the market and was able to stay open.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nBusiness grew, and Flying Fish began to produce a range of beers year-round, along with a variety of seasonal specialties. Flying Fish beers are ten-time medal winners at the [[Great American Beer Festival]], the most of any New Jersey brewery. Success meant expansion, and in 2012, Flying Fish moved from Cherry Hill to its new facility in [[Somerdale, New Jersey|Somerdale]], making it the largest brewery built in the state since prohibition. The transition saw Flying Fish go from a 10,000 square ft. to 45,000 square ft. building and increase productivity from 20 barrels to 50 barrels at a time. However, due to new automation in the Somerdale location it has been able to brew three times the amount of beer in less time. The tasting room at Somerdale offers weekly one-off and barrel aged beers.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nOn November 9, Flying Fish announced that Gene Muller would be moving solely to the founder position of Flying Fish. In his stead Lou Romano became President, effective November 20, 2017. Romano, who began working in the beer business at age 16, came most recently from [[Oskar Blues Brewery]], where he served as National Sales Manager since 2013. Before that, Romano served in a variety of capacities, including Director of Marketing & Wholesaler Development, for [[Yuengling|D. G. Yuengling & Son]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://brewingindustryguide.com/flying-fish-brewing-announces-leadership-change/|title=Flying Fish Brewing Announces Leadership Change|website=Brewing Industry Guide|language=en|access-date=2018-12-10}}</ref>\n\n== Community and charity ==\nThis facility boasts many sustainability features, to increase water and energy conservation, to brew the award-winning beer in the most environmentally friendly way possible. In 2014 Flying Fish worked alongside the [[Conserve Wildlife Foundation of New Jersey]] in an effort to help educate locals about the [[Piping plover|Piping Plover]] \"Bahamas Project\" and showed a connection between The Bahamas and the U.S. for the endangered beach nesting bird species.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.conservewildlifenj.org/blog/tag/flying-fish-brewing-company/|title=Flying Fish Brewing Company \u00ab Conserve Wildlife Foundation of New Jersey|language=en-US|access-date=2018-12-10}}</ref>\n\nFlying Fish is also known for its ties to the community: each year, the company donates more than $100,000 in goods, services and merchandise to local nonprofit causes. Flying Fish also has partnered with Great American Brewery Runs, an organization that partners with local breweries to host festivals and charity runs. Flying Fish hosts the \"Flying Fish 5k\" at its Somerdale location.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.greatamericanbreweryruns.com/page/show/1278338-great-american-brewery-runs|title=Home|website=Great American Brewery Runs|language=en-us|access-date=2018-12-10}}</ref> In 2013, following the events of [[Hurricane Sandy]], Flying Fish crafted a new hybrid beer called \"Forever Unloved Sandy\" in which all proceeds went to charitable efforts to restore New Jersey.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://philly.thedrinknation.com/articles/read/9828-Flying-Fish-Brewing-to-Release-F-U-Sandy-Beer-for-Charity|title=Flying Fish Brewing to Release F.

The latter two are bottle-conditioned. Less available (often only in [[growler (beer)|growlers]] at the brewery) are Big Fish Barleywine, a Coffee Porter, Love Fish (a cherry-infused Belgian Abbey Dubbel available around [[Valentine's Day]]), Black Fish, and Imperial Espresso Porter. In January 2012, Flying Fish added Red Fish, a hoppy red ale, to its lineup.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nIn the summer of 2004, Flying Fish produced a blueberry flavored Abbey Dubbel available only in 1/6 kegs to recipients of the brewery's mailing list.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nFirst in the region to be featured at the [[Great British Beer Festival]], Flying Fish has also been featured at the [[Oregon Brewers Festival]] and [[Canada]]'s Biere de Mondial Festival and has also won several medals at both the Real Ale Festival in [[Chicago]] and the World Beer Championships.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\n===Exit series===\nIn 2009, Flying Fish began releasing a series of beers named after [[New Jersey Turnpike]] exits, each in styles intended to represent the part of the state served by that exit. New beers in the series are released at variable intervals, usually several months apart, with an extended hiatus as Flying Fish moved into their new facility in 2012. The inaugural release in the series honored the brewery's home exit, Exit 4, in March 2009.\n\nThe exit series has generated some controversy, as the NJ chapter of [[Mothers Against Drunk Driving|MADD]] has criticized the association of driving and alcohol.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+ Exit Series releases\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" data-sort-type=\"number\"| Exit\n! scope=\"col\"| Name\n! scope=\"col\" data-sort-type=\"isoDate\"| Release date\n|-\n| data-sort-value=\"4\"| Exit 4\n| American [[Tripel|Trippel]]\n| data-sort-value=\"2009-03-01\"| March 2009\n|-\n| data-sort-value=\"11\"| Exit 11\n| Hoppy American [[Wheat beer|Wheat]]\n| data-sort-value=\"2009-07-01\"| July 2009\n|-\n| data-sort-value=\"1\"| Exit 1\n| Bayshore [[Oyster Stout]]\n| data-sort-value=\"2009-10-01\"| October 2009<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thebarleyblog.com/2009/flying-fish-accounces-exit-1/|title=Flying Fish Accounces Exit 1 -

With this level of competition, Muller recalls the time as very difficult to stay afloat.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://digital.hagley.org/Gene_Muller_1_29_16?solr_nav%5Bid%5D=e7f0aea79b436e9fbfce&solr_nav%5Bpage%5D=0&solr_nav%5Boffset%5D=1|title=Interview with Gene Muller, 2016 January 29 {{!}} Hagley Digital Archives|website=digital.hagley.org|access-date=2018-12-10}}</ref> Flying Fish was able to gain more funding so it could buy a larger volume of packaging, making their pricing more competitive in the market and was able to stay open.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nBusiness grew, and Flying Fish began to produce a range of beers year-round, along with a variety of seasonal specialties. Flying Fish beers are ten-time medal winners at the [[Great American Beer Festival]], the most of any New Jersey brewery. Success meant expansion, and in 2012, Flying Fish moved from Cherry Hill to its new facility in [[Somerdale, New Jersey|Somerdale]], making it the largest brewery built in the state since prohibition. The transition saw Flying Fish go from a 10,000 square ft. to 45,000 square ft. building and increase productivity from 20 barrels to 50 barrels at a time. However, due to new automation in the Somerdale location it has been able to brew three times the amount of beer in less time. The tasting room at Somerdale offers weekly one-off and barrel aged beers.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nOn November 9, Flying Fish announced that Gene Muller would be moving solely to the founder position of Flying Fish. In his stead Lou Romano became President, effective November 20, 2017. Romano, who began working in the beer business at age 16, came most recently from [[Oskar Blues Brewery]], where he served as National Sales Manager since 2013. Before that, Romano served in a variety of capacities, including Director of Marketing & Wholesaler Development, for [[Yuengling|D. G. Yuengling & Son]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://brewingindustryguide.com/flying-fish-brewing-announces-leadership-change/|title=Flying Fish Brewing Announces Leadership Change|website=Brewing Industry Guide|language=en|access-date=2018-12-10}}</ref>\n\n== Community and charity ==\nThis facility boasts many sustainability features, to increase water and energy conservation, to brew the award-winning beer in the most environmentally friendly way possible. In 2014 Flying Fish worked alongside the [[Conserve Wildlife Foundation of New Jersey]] in an effort to help educate locals about the [[Piping plover|Piping Plover]] \"Bahamas Project\" and showed a connection between The Bahamas and the U.S. for the endangered beach nesting bird species.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.conservewildlifenj.org/blog/tag/flying-fish-brewing-company/|title=Flying Fish Brewing Company \u00ab Conserve Wildlife Foundation of New Jersey|language=en-US|access-date=2018-12-10}}</ref>\n\nFlying Fish is also known for its ties to the community: each year, the company donates more than $100,000 in goods, services and merchandise to local nonprofit causes. Flying Fish also has partnered with Great American Brewery Runs, an organization that partners with local breweries to host festivals and charity runs. Flying Fish hosts the \"Flying Fish 5k\" at its Somerdale location.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.greatamericanbreweryruns.com/page/show/1278338-great-american-brewery-runs|title=Home|website=Great American Brewery Runs|language=en-us|access-date=2018-12-10}}</ref> In 2013, following the events of [[Hurricane Sandy]], Flying Fish crafted a new hybrid beer called \"Forever Unloved Sandy\" in which all proceeds went to charitable efforts to restore New Jersey.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://philly.thedrinknation.com/articles/read/9828-Flying-Fish-Brewing-to-Release-F-U-Sandy-Beer-for-Charity|title=Flying Fish Brewing to Release F.

The latter two are bottle-conditioned. Less available (often only in [[growler (beer)|growlers]] at the brewery) are Big Fish Barleywine, a Coffee Porter, Love Fish (a cherry-infused Belgian Abbey Dubbel available around [[Valentine's Day]]), Black Fish, and Imperial Espresso Porter. In January 2012, Flying Fish added Red Fish, a hoppy red ale, to its lineup.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nIn the summer of 2004, Flying Fish produced a blueberry flavored Abbey Dubbel available only in 1/6 kegs to recipients of the brewery's mailing list.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\nFirst in the region to be featured at the [[Great British Beer Festival]], Flying Fish has also been featured at the [[Oregon Brewers Festival]] and [[Canada]]'s Biere de Mondial Festival and has also won several medals at both the Real Ale Festival in [[Chicago]] and the World Beer Championships.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\n===Exit series===\nIn 2009, Flying Fish began releasing a series of beers named after [[New Jersey Turnpike]] exits, each in styles intended to represent the part of the state served by that exit. New beers in the series are released at variable intervals, usually several months apart, with an extended hiatus as Flying Fish moved into their new facility in 2012. The inaugural release in the series honored the brewery's home exit, Exit 4, in March 2009.\n\nThe exit series has generated some controversy, as the NJ chapter of [[Mothers Against Drunk Driving|MADD]] has criticized the association of driving and alcohol.{{citation needed|date=December 2018}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|+ Exit Series releases\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" data-sort-type=\"number\"| Exit\n! scope=\"col\"| Name\n! scope=\"col\" data-sort-type=\"isoDate\"| Release date\n|-\n| data-sort-value=\"4\"| Exit 4\n| American [[Tripel|Trippel]]\n| data-sort-value=\"2009-03-01\"| March 2009\n|-\n| data-sort-value=\"11\"| Exit 11\n| Hoppy American [[Wheat beer|Wheat]]\n| data-sort-value=\"2009-07-01\"| July 2009\n|-\n| data-sort-value=\"1\"| Exit 1\n| Bayshore [[Oyster Stout]]\n| data-sort-value=\"2009-10-01\"| October 2009<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thebarleyblog.com/2009/flying-fish-accounces-exit-1/|title=Flying Fish Accounces Exit 1 -

Making use of twenty knives and two tape recorders, the artist played the [[Knife game|Russian game]], in which rhythmic knife jabs are aimed between the splayed fingers of one's hand. Each time she cut herself, she would pick up a new knife from the row of twenty she had set up, and record the operation. After cutting herself twenty times, she replayed the tape, listened to the sounds, and tried to repeat the same movements, attempting to replicate the mistakes, merging past and present. She set out to explore the physical and mental limitations of the body \u2013 the pain and the sounds of the stabbing; the double sounds from the history and the replication. With this piece, Abramovi\u0107 began to consider the state of consciousness of the performer. \"Once you enter into the performance state you can push your body to do things you absolutely could never normally do.\"<ref>Kaplan, 9</ref>\n\n===''Rhythm 5'', 1974===\nIn this performance, Abramovi\u0107 sought to re-evoke the energy of extreme bodily pain, using a large petroleum-drenched star, which the artist lit on fire at the start of the performance. Standing outside the star, Abramovi\u0107 cut her nails, toenails, and hair. When finished with each, she threw the clippings into the flames, creating a burst of light each time. Burning the communist five-pointed star represented a physical and mental purification, while also addressing the political traditions of her past. In the final act of purification, Abramovi\u0107 leapt across the flames into the center of the large star. At first, due to the light and smoke given off by the fire, the observing audience did not realize that the artist had lost consciousness from lack of oxygen inside the star. However, when the flames came very near to her body and she still remained inert, a doctor and others intervened and extricated her from the star.\n\nAbramovi\u0107 later commented upon this experience: \"I was very angry because I understood there is a physical limit. When you lose consciousness you can't be present, you can't perform.\"<ref>Daneri, 29</ref>\n\n===''Rhythm 2'', 1974===\nPrompted by her loss of consciousness during Rhythm 5, Abramovi\u0107 devised the two-part Rhythm 2 to incorporate a state of unconsciousness in a performance. She performed the work at the Gallery of Contemporary Art in Zagreb, in 1974. In Part I, which had a duration of 50 minutes, she ingested a medication she describes as 'given to patients who suffer from [[catatonia]], to force them to change the positions of their bodies.' The medication caused her muscles to contract violently, and she lost complete control over her body while remaining aware of what was going on. After a ten-minute break, she took a second medication 'given to schizophrenic patients with violent behavior disorders to calm them down.' The performance ended after five hours when the medication wore off.<ref>{{cite book |publisher=Manchester University Press |isbn=978-0-7190-8747-9 |pages=132\u2013144 |last1=Dezeuze |first1=Anna |last2=Ward, Frazer |title=The \"Do-It-Yourself\" Artwork: Participation from Fluxus to New Media |chapter=Marina Abramovic: Approaching zero |location=Manchester |date=2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |publisher=Charta |isbn=978-88-8158-175-7 |last1=Pejic |first1=Bojana |last2=Abramovic |first2=Marina |last3=McEvilley |first3=Thomas |last4=Stoos |first4=Toni |title=Marina Abramovic: Artist Body |location=Milano |date=July 2, 1998}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |edition=Second Printing  |publisher=The Museum of Modern Art, New York |isbn=978-0-87070-747-6 |last1=Danto |first1=Arthur |last2=Iles |first2=Chrissie |last3=Abramovic |first3=Marina |others=Klaus Biesenbach (ed.) |title=Marina Abramovic: The Artist is Present |location=New York |date=April 30, 2010}}</ref>\n\n===''Rhythm 4'', 1974===\nIn this piece, Abramovi\u0107 kneeled alone and naked in a room with a high-power industrial fan.

She assigned a passive role to herself, with the public being the force which would act on her. Abramovi\u0107 placed on a table 72 objects that people were allowed to use in any way that they chose; a sign informed them that they held no responsibility for any of their actions. Some of the objects could give pleasure, while others could be wielded to inflict pain, or to harm her. Among them were a rose, a feather, honey, a whip, olive oil, scissors, a scalpel, a gun and a single bullet. For six hours the artist allowed audience members to manipulate her body and actions without consequences. This tested how vulnerable and aggressive human subjects could be when actions have no social consequences.<ref name=\"demaria\" /> At first the audience did not do much and was extremely passive. However, as the realization began to set in that there was no limit to their actions, the piece became brutal. By the end of the performance, her body was stripped, attacked, and devalued into an image that Abramovi\u0107 described as the \"Madonna, mother, and whore.\"<ref name=\"demaria\" /> Additionally, markings of aggression were written on the artist's body. There were cuts on her neck made by audience members, and her clothes were cut off her body. With an initial determination to find out how the public acts with no consequences tied to their actions, she realized by the end that the public might very well have killed her for their own personal enjoyment.\n\nIn her works, Abramovi\u0107 affirms her identity through the perspective of others, however, more importantly by changing the roles of each player, the identity and nature of humanity at large is unraveled and showcased. By doing so, the individual experience morphs into a collective one and creates a powerful message.<ref name=\"demaria\" /> Abramovi\u0107's art also represents the objectification of the female body, as she remains motionless and allows spectators to do as they please with her body; the audience pushes the limits of what one would consider acceptable. By presenting her body as an object, she explores the elements of danger and physical exhaustion.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Demaria|first=Cristina|date=2016-07-25|title=The Performative Body of Marina Abramovi\u0107: Rerelating (in) Time and Space|url=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1350506804044464|journal=European Journal of Women's Studies|language=en|doi=10.1177/1350506804044464}}</ref>\n\nInitially, members of the audience reacted with caution and modesty, but as time passed (and the artist remained passive) people began to act more aggressively. As Abramovi\u0107 described it later: \"What I learned was that&nbsp;... if you leave it up to the audience, they can kill you.&nbsp;... I felt really violated: they cut up my clothes, stuck rose thorns in my stomach, one person aimed the gun at my head, and another took it away. It created an aggressive atmosphere. After exactly 6 hours, as planned, I stood up and started walking toward the audience. Everyone ran away, to escape an actual confrontation.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thetheatretimes.com/audience-to-be/|title=Audience To Be|date=2019-02-11|website=The Theatre Times|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-04}}</ref>\n\n===Works with Ulay (Uwe Laysiepen)===\n[[File:Abramovic Ulay.jpg|thumb|Marina Abramovi\u0107 and Uwe Laysiepen 1978]]\nIn 1976, after moving to Amsterdam, Abramovi\u0107 met the [[West Germany|West German]] performance artist [[Uwe Laysiepen]], who went by the single name Ulay. They began living and performing together that year. When Abramovi\u0107 and Ulay began their collaboration,<ref name=Garage/> the main concepts they explored were the ego and artistic identity. They created \"relation works\" characterized by constant movement, change, process and \"art vital\".<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|title=Theories and Documents of Contemporary Art, 2nd ed.|last=Stiles|first=Kristine|publisher=University of California Press|year=2012|isbn=|location=|pages=808\u2013809}}</ref> This was the beginning of a decade of influential collaborative work. Each performer was interested in the traditions of their cultural heritage and the individual's desire for ritual. Consequently, they decided to form a collective being called \"The Other\", and spoke of themselves as parts of a \"two-headed body\".<ref>Quoted in Green, 37</ref> They dressed and behaved like twins and created a relationship of complete trust. As they defined this phantom identity, their individual identities became less accessible. In an analysis of phantom artistic identities, Charles Green has noted that this allowed a deeper understanding of the artist as performer, for it revealed a way of \"having the artistic self-made available for self-scrutiny\".<ref>Green, 41</ref>\n\nThe work of Abramovi\u0107 and Ulay tested the physical limits of the body and explored male and female principles, psychic energy, [[transcendental meditation]] and [[nonverbal communication]].<ref name=\":3\" /> While some critics have explored the idea of a [[hermaphroditic]] state of being as a [[feminist]] statement, Abramovi\u0107 herself denies considering this as a conscious concept. Her body studies, she insists, have always been concerned primarily with the body as the unit of an individual, a tendency she traces to her parents' military pasts. Rather than concerning themselves with [[gender]] ideologies, Abramovi\u0107/Ulay explored extreme states of consciousness and their relationship to architectural space. They devised a series of works in which their bodies created additional spaces for audience interaction. In discussing this phase of her performance history, she has said: \"The main problem in this relationship was what to do with the two artists' egos. I had to find out how to put my ego down, as did he, to create something like a hermaphroditic state of being that we called the death self.\"<ref>Kaplan, 14</ref>\n*In ''Relation in Space'' (1976) they ran into each other repeatedly for an hour \u2013 mixing male and female energy into the third component called \"that self\".<ref name=Garage/>\n*''Relation in Movement'' (1977) had the pair driving their car inside of a museum for 365 laps; a black liquid oozed from the car, forming a kind of sculpture, each lap representing a year. (After 365 laps the idea was that they entered the New Millennium.)\n*In ''Relation in Time'' (1977) they sat back to back, tied together by their ponytails for sixteen hours. They then allowed the public to enter the room to see if they could use the energy of the public to push their limits even further.<ref name=\"uoregon1\">{{cite web|author=|url=https://blogs.uoregon.edu/marinaabramovic/category/ulayabramovic/ |title=Ulay/Abramovi\u0107 \u2013 Marina Abramovi\u0107 |publisher=Blogs.uoregon.edu |date=February 12, 2015 |accessdate=2017-03-10}}</ref>\n*To create ''[[Breathing in/breathing out|Breathing In/Breathing Out]]'' the two artists devised a piece in which they connected their mouths and took in each other's exhaled breaths until they had used up all of the available oxygen. Seventeen minutes after the beginning of the performance they both fell to the floor unconscious, their lungs having filled with carbon dioxide. This personal piece explored the idea of an individual's ability to absorb the life of another person, exchanging and destroying it.\n*In ''Imponderabilia'' (1977, reenacted in 2010) two performers of opposite sexes, both completely nude, stand in a narrow doorway. The public must squeeze between them in order to pass, and in doing so choose which one of them to face.<ref name=Garage/>\n*In ''AAA-AAA'' (1978) the two artists stood opposite each other and made long sounds with their mouths open. They gradually moved closer and closer, until they were eventually yelling directly into each other's mouths.<ref name=\"uoregon1\"/> This piece demonstrated their interest in endurance and duration.<ref name=\"uoregon1\"/>\n*In 1980, they performed ''[[Rest Energy (performance piece)|Rest Energy]],'' in an art exhibition in [[Dublin]], where both balanced each other on opposite sides of a drawn bow and arrow, with the arrow pointed at Abramovi\u0107's heart. With almost no effort, Ulay could easily kill Abramovi\u0107 with one finger. This seems to symbolize the dominance of men and what kind of upperhand they have in society over women. In addition, the handle of the bow is held by Abramovi\u0107 and is pointed at herself. The handle of the bow is the most significant part of a bow. This would be a whole different piece if it were a Ulay aiming a bow at an Abramovi\u0107, but by having her hold the bow, it is almost as if the she is supporting him while taking her own life.<ref name=Garage/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.phaidon.com/agenda/art/picture-galleries/2010/march/22/documenting-the-performance-art-of-marina-abramovi-in-pictures/?idx=9 |title=Documenting the performance art of Marina Abramovi\u0107 in pictures &#124; Art &#124; Agenda |publisher=Phaidon |date= |accessdate=2017-03-10}}</ref>\n\nBetween 1981 and 1987, the pair performed ''Nightsea Crossing'' in twenty-two performances. They sat silently across from each other in chairs for seven hours a day.<ref name=\"uoregon1\"/>\n\nIn 1988, after several years of tense relations, Abramovi\u0107 and Ulay decided to make a spiritual journey which would end their relationship. They each walked the Great Wall of China, in a piece called ''Lovers,'' starting from the two opposite ends and meeting in the middle. As Abramovi\u0107 described it: \"That walk became a complete personal drama. Ulay started from the [[Gobi Desert]] and I from the [[Yellow Sea]]. After each of us walked 2500&nbsp;km, we met in the middle and said good-bye.\"<ref name=\"Daneri, 35\">{{cite web|url=http://kickasstrips.com/2015/01/lovers-abramovic-ulay-walk-the-length-of-the-great-wall-of-china-from-opposite-ends-meet-in-the-middle-and-breakup/|title=Lovers Abramovi\u0107 & Ulay Walk the Length of the Great Wall of China from opposite ends, Meet in the Middle and BreakUp \u2013 Kickass Trips|date=January 14, 2015|language=en-US|access-date=2016-09-29}}</ref> She has said that she conceived this walk in a dream, and it provided what she thought was an appropriate, romantic ending to a relationship full of [[mysticism]], energy, and attraction. She later described the process: \"We needed a certain form of ending, after this huge distance walking towards each other. It is very human. It is in a way more dramatic, more like a film ending&nbsp;...

Each video is filmed with its own sound, creating an overlap. As the skeleton becomes cleaner, Abramovi\u0107 becomes covered in the grayish dirt that was once covering the skeleton. This three-hour performance is filled with metaphors of the Tibetan death rites that prepare disciples to become one with their own mortality. The piece consists of a three-piece series. ''Cleaning the Mirror'' #1 was performed at the [[Museum of Modern Art]], consisting of three hours. ''Cleaning the Mirror'' #2 consists of 90 minutes performed at Oxford University.

On seven consecutive nights for seven hours she recreated the works of five artists first performed in the '60s and '70s, in addition to re-performing her own ''Lips of Thomas'' and introducing a new performance on the last night. The performances were arduous, requiring both the physical and the mental concentration of the artist.  Included in Abramovi\u0107's performances were recreations of [[Gina Pane]]'s ''The Conditioning,'' which required lying on a bed frame suspended over a grid of lit candles, and of [[Vito Acconci]]'s 1972 performance in which the artist masturbated under the floorboards of a gallery as visitors walked overhead.

Tensions among visitors in line could have arisen from an understanding that for every minute each person in line spent with Abramovi\u0107, there would be that many fewer minutes in the day for those further back in line to spend with the artist. Due to the strenuous nature of sitting for hours at a time, art-enthusiasts have speculated as to whether Abramovi\u0107 wore an adult diaper to eliminate the need to move to urinate. Others have highlighted the movements she made in between sitters as a focus of analysis, as the only variations in the artist between sitters were when she would cry if a sitter cried and her moment of physical contact with Ulay, one of the earliest visitors to the exhibition. Abramovi\u0107 sat across from 1,545 sitters, including [[Klaus Biesenbach]], [[James Franco]], [[Lou Reed]], [[Alan Rickman]], [[Jemima Kirke]], [[Jennifer Carpenter]] and [[Bj\u00f6rk]]; sitters were asked not to touch or speak to the artist.

The public would enter the space and be asked to take off all of their clothes and give them to Abramovi\u0107. The individuals would then wait around as she would wash, dry and iron their clothes for them, and once she was done, she would give them back their clothing, and they could get dressed and then leave.

Making use of twenty knives and two tape recorders, the artist played the [[Knife game|Russian game]], in which rhythmic knife jabs are aimed between the splayed fingers of one's hand. Each time she cut herself, she would pick up a new knife from the row of twenty she had set up, and record the operation. After cutting herself twenty times, she replayed the tape, listened to the sounds, and tried to repeat the same movements, attempting to replicate the mistakes, merging past and present. She set out to explore the physical and mental limitations of the body \u2013 the pain and the sounds of the stabbing; the double sounds from the history and the replication. With this piece, Abramovi\u0107 began to consider the state of consciousness of the performer. \"Once you enter into the performance state you can push your body to do things you absolutely could never normally do.\"<ref>Kaplan, 9</ref>\n\n===''Rhythm 5'', 1974===\nIn this performance, Abramovi\u0107 sought to re-evoke the energy of extreme bodily pain, using a large petroleum-drenched star, which the artist lit on fire at the start of the performance. Standing outside the star, Abramovi\u0107 cut her nails, toenails, and hair. When finished with each, she threw the clippings into the flames, creating a burst of light each time. Burning the communist five-pointed star represented a physical and mental purification, while also addressing the political traditions of her past. In the final act of purification, Abramovi\u0107 leapt across the flames into the center of the large star. At first, due to the light and smoke given off by the fire, the observing audience did not realize that the artist had lost consciousness from lack of oxygen inside the star. However, when the flames came very near to her body and she still remained inert, a doctor and others intervened and extricated her from the star.\n\nAbramovi\u0107 later commented upon this experience: \"I was very angry because I understood there is a physical limit. When you lose consciousness you can't be present, you can't perform.\"<ref>Daneri, 29</ref>\n\n===''Rhythm 2'', 1974===\nPrompted by her loss of consciousness during Rhythm 5, Abramovi\u0107 devised the two-part Rhythm 2 to incorporate a state of unconsciousness in a performance. She performed the work at the Gallery of Contemporary Art in Zagreb, in 1974. In Part I, which had a duration of 50 minutes, she ingested a medication she describes as 'given to patients who suffer from [[catatonia]], to force them to change the positions of their bodies.' The medication caused her muscles to contract violently, and she lost complete control over her body while remaining aware of what was going on. After a ten-minute break, she took a second medication 'given to schizophrenic patients with violent behavior disorders to calm them down.' The performance ended after five hours when the medication wore off.<ref>{{cite book |publisher=Manchester University Press |isbn=978-0-7190-8747-9 |pages=132\u2013144 |last1=Dezeuze |first1=Anna |last2=Ward, Frazer |title=The \"Do-It-Yourself\" Artwork: Participation from Fluxus to New Media |chapter=Marina Abramovic: Approaching zero |location=Manchester |date=2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |publisher=Charta |isbn=978-88-8158-175-7 |last1=Pejic |first1=Bojana |last2=Abramovic |first2=Marina |last3=McEvilley |first3=Thomas |last4=Stoos |first4=Toni |title=Marina Abramovic: Artist Body |location=Milano |date=July 2, 1998}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |edition=Second Printing  |publisher=The Museum of Modern Art, New York |isbn=978-0-87070-747-6 |last1=Danto |first1=Arthur |last2=Iles |first2=Chrissie |last3=Abramovic |first3=Marina |others=Klaus Biesenbach (ed.) |title=Marina Abramovic: The Artist is Present |location=New York |date=April 30, 2010}}</ref>\n\n===''Rhythm 4'', 1974===\nIn this piece, Abramovi\u0107 kneeled alone and naked in a room with a high-power industrial fan.

She assigned a passive role to herself, with the public being the force which would act on her. Abramovi\u0107 placed on a table 72 objects that people were allowed to use in any way that they chose; a sign informed them that they held no responsibility for any of their actions. Some of the objects could give pleasure, while others could be wielded to inflict pain, or to harm her. Among them were a rose, a feather, honey, a whip, olive oil, scissors, a scalpel, a gun and a single bullet. For six hours the artist allowed audience members to manipulate her body and actions without consequences. This tested how vulnerable and aggressive human subjects could be when actions have no social consequences.<ref name=\"demaria\" /> At first the audience did not do much and was extremely passive. However, as the realization began to set in that there was no limit to their actions, the piece became brutal. By the end of the performance, her body was stripped, attacked, and devalued into an image that Abramovi\u0107 described as the \"Madonna, mother, and whore.\"<ref name=\"demaria\" /> Additionally, markings of aggression were written on the artist's body. There were cuts on her neck made by audience members, and her clothes were cut off her body. With an initial determination to find out how the public acts with no consequences tied to their actions, she realized by the end that the public might very well have killed her for their own personal enjoyment.\n\nIn her works, Abramovi\u0107 affirms her identity through the perspective of others, however, more importantly by changing the roles of each player, the identity and nature of humanity at large is unraveled and showcased. By doing so, the individual experience morphs into a collective one and creates a powerful message.<ref name=\"demaria\" /> Abramovi\u0107's art also represents the objectification of the female body, as she remains motionless and allows spectators to do as they please with her body; the audience pushes the limits of what one would consider acceptable. By presenting her body as an object, she explores the elements of danger and physical exhaustion.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Demaria|first=Cristina|date=2016-07-25|title=The Performative Body of Marina Abramovi\u0107: Rerelating (in) Time and Space|url=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1350506804044464|journal=European Journal of Women's Studies|language=en|doi=10.1177/1350506804044464}}</ref>\n\nInitially, members of the audience reacted with caution and modesty, but as time passed (and the artist remained passive) people began to act more aggressively. As Abramovi\u0107 described it later: \"What I learned was that&nbsp;... if you leave it up to the audience, they can kill you.&nbsp;... I felt really violated: they cut up my clothes, stuck rose thorns in my stomach, one person aimed the gun at my head, and another took it away. It created an aggressive atmosphere. After exactly 6 hours, as planned, I stood up and started walking toward the audience. Everyone ran away, to escape an actual confrontation.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thetheatretimes.com/audience-to-be/|title=Audience To Be|date=2019-02-11|website=The Theatre Times|language=en-US|access-date=2020-03-04}}</ref>\n\n===Works with Ulay (Uwe Laysiepen)===\n[[File:Abramovic Ulay.jpg|thumb|Marina Abramovi\u0107 and Uwe Laysiepen 1978]]\nIn 1976, after moving to Amsterdam, Abramovi\u0107 met the [[West Germany|West German]] performance artist [[Uwe Laysiepen]], who went by the single name Ulay. They began living and performing together that year. When Abramovi\u0107 and Ulay began their collaboration,<ref name=Garage/> the main concepts they explored were the ego and artistic identity. They created \"relation works\" characterized by constant movement, change, process and \"art vital\".<ref name=\":3\">{{Cite book|title=Theories and Documents of Contemporary Art, 2nd ed.|last=Stiles|first=Kristine|publisher=University of California Press|year=2012|isbn=|location=|pages=808\u2013809}}</ref> This was the beginning of a decade of influential collaborative work. Each performer was interested in the traditions of their cultural heritage and the individual's desire for ritual. Consequently, they decided to form a collective being called \"The Other\", and spoke of themselves as parts of a \"two-headed body\".<ref>Quoted in Green, 37</ref> They dressed and behaved like twins and created a relationship of complete trust. As they defined this phantom identity, their individual identities became less accessible. In an analysis of phantom artistic identities, Charles Green has noted that this allowed a deeper understanding of the artist as performer, for it revealed a way of \"having the artistic self-made available for self-scrutiny\".<ref>Green, 41</ref>\n\nThe work of Abramovi\u0107 and Ulay tested the physical limits of the body and explored male and female principles, psychic energy, [[transcendental meditation]] and [[nonverbal communication]].<ref name=\":3\" /> While some critics have explored the idea of a [[hermaphroditic]] state of being as a [[feminist]] statement, Abramovi\u0107 herself denies considering this as a conscious concept. Her body studies, she insists, have always been concerned primarily with the body as the unit of an individual, a tendency she traces to her parents' military pasts. Rather than concerning themselves with [[gender]] ideologies, Abramovi\u0107/Ulay explored extreme states of consciousness and their relationship to architectural space. They devised a series of works in which their bodies created additional spaces for audience interaction. In discussing this phase of her performance history, she has said: \"The main problem in this relationship was what to do with the two artists' egos. I had to find out how to put my ego down, as did he, to create something like a hermaphroditic state of being that we called the death self.\"<ref>Kaplan, 14</ref>\n*In ''Relation in Space'' (1976) they ran into each other repeatedly for an hour \u2013 mixing male and female energy into the third component called \"that self\".<ref name=Garage/>\n*''Relation in Movement'' (1977) had the pair driving their car inside of a museum for 365 laps; a black liquid oozed from the car, forming a kind of sculpture, each lap representing a year. (After 365 laps the idea was that they entered the New Millennium.)\n*In ''Relation in Time'' (1977) they sat back to back, tied together by their ponytails for sixteen hours. They then allowed the public to enter the room to see if they could use the energy of the public to push their limits even further.<ref name=\"uoregon1\">{{cite web|author=|url=https://blogs.uoregon.edu/marinaabramovic/category/ulayabramovic/ |title=Ulay/Abramovi\u0107 \u2013 Marina Abramovi\u0107 |publisher=Blogs.uoregon.edu |date=February 12, 2015 |accessdate=2017-03-10}}</ref>\n*To create ''[[Breathing in/breathing out|Breathing In/Breathing Out]]'' the two artists devised a piece in which they connected their mouths and took in each other's exhaled breaths until they had used up all of the available oxygen. Seventeen minutes after the beginning of the performance they both fell to the floor unconscious, their lungs having filled with carbon dioxide. This personal piece explored the idea of an individual's ability to absorb the life of another person, exchanging and destroying it.\n*In ''Imponderabilia'' (1977, reenacted in 2010) two performers of opposite sexes, both completely nude, stand in a narrow doorway. The public must squeeze between them in order to pass, and in doing so choose which one of them to face.<ref name=Garage/>\n*In ''AAA-AAA'' (1978) the two artists stood opposite each other and made long sounds with their mouths open. They gradually moved closer and closer, until they were eventually yelling directly into each other's mouths.<ref name=\"uoregon1\"/> This piece demonstrated their interest in endurance and duration.<ref name=\"uoregon1\"/>\n*In 1980, they performed ''[[Rest Energy (performance piece)|Rest Energy]],'' in an art exhibition in [[Dublin]], where both balanced each other on opposite sides of a drawn bow and arrow, with the arrow pointed at Abramovi\u0107's heart. With almost no effort, Ulay could easily kill Abramovi\u0107 with one finger. This seems to symbolize the dominance of men and what kind of upperhand they have in society over women. In addition, the handle of the bow is held by Abramovi\u0107 and is pointed at herself. The handle of the bow is the most significant part of a bow. This would be a whole different piece if it were a Ulay aiming a bow at an Abramovi\u0107, but by having her hold the bow, it is almost as if the she is supporting him while taking her own life.<ref name=Garage/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.phaidon.com/agenda/art/picture-galleries/2010/march/22/documenting-the-performance-art-of-marina-abramovi-in-pictures/?idx=9 |title=Documenting the performance art of Marina Abramovi\u0107 in pictures &#124; Art &#124; Agenda |publisher=Phaidon |date= |accessdate=2017-03-10}}</ref>\n\nBetween 1981 and 1987, the pair performed ''Nightsea Crossing'' in twenty-two performances. They sat silently across from each other in chairs for seven hours a day.<ref name=\"uoregon1\"/>\n\nIn 1988, after several years of tense relations, Abramovi\u0107 and Ulay decided to make a spiritual journey which would end their relationship. They each walked the Great Wall of China, in a piece called ''Lovers,'' starting from the two opposite ends and meeting in the middle. As Abramovi\u0107 described it: \"That walk became a complete personal drama. Ulay started from the [[Gobi Desert]] and I from the [[Yellow Sea]].

She later described the process: \"We needed a certain form of ending, after this huge distance walking towards each other. It is very human. It is in a way more dramatic, more like a film ending&nbsp;... Because in the end, you are really alone, whatever you do.\"<ref name=\"Daneri, 35\"/> She reported that during her walk she was reinterpreting her connection to the physical world and to nature.

Each video is filmed with its own sound, creating an overlap. As the skeleton becomes cleaner, Abramovi\u0107 becomes covered in the grayish dirt that was once covering the skeleton. This three-hour performance is filled with metaphors of the Tibetan death rites that prepare disciples to become one with their own mortality. The piece consists of a three-piece series. ''Cleaning the Mirror'' #1 was performed at the [[Museum of Modern Art]], consisting of three hours. ''Cleaning the Mirror'' #2 consists of 90 minutes performed at Oxford University.

The performances were arduous, requiring both the physical and the mental concentration of the artist.

Tensions among visitors in line could have arisen from an understanding that for every minute each person in line spent with Abramovi\u0107, there would be that many fewer minutes in the day for those further back in line to spend with the artist. Due to the strenuous nature of sitting for hours at a time, art-enthusiasts have speculated as to whether Abramovi\u0107 wore an adult diaper to eliminate the need to move to urinate. Others have highlighted the movements she made in between sitters as a focus of analysis, as the only variations in the artist between sitters were when she would cry if a sitter cried and her moment of physical contact with Ulay, one of the earliest visitors to the exhibition. Abramovi\u0107 sat across from 1,545 sitters, including [[Klaus Biesenbach]], [[James Franco]], [[Lou Reed]], [[Alan Rickman]], [[Jemima Kirke]], [[Jennifer Carpenter]] and [[Bj\u00f6rk]]; sitters were asked not to touch or speak to the artist.
