The WFP was formally established in 1963 by the FAO and the [[United Nations General Assembly]] on a three-year experimental basis. In 1965, the programme was extended to a continuing basis.\n\n===Goals and strategies===\n[[File:Armored vehicle from the UN World Food Program.JPG|thumb|A WFP armoured vehicle.]]\nThe WFP strives to eradicate [[hunger]] and [[malnutrition]], with the ultimate goal in mind of eliminating the need for food aid itself.\n\nThe objectives that the WFP hopes to achieve are to:<ref>{{cite web |last=WFP |title=Our Work |url=http://www.wfp.org/our-work |publisher=WFP |accessdate=2 November 2013}}</ref>\n\n# \"Save lives and protect livelihoods in emergencies\"\n# \"Support food security and nutrition and (re)build livelihoods in fragile settings and following emergencies\"\n# \"Reduce risk and enable people, communities and countries to meet their own food and nutrition needs\"\n# \"Reduce under-nutrition and break the inter-generational cycle of hunger\"\n# \"Zero Hunger in 2030\"\n\nWFP food aid is also directed to fight [[micronutrient]] deficiencies, reduce [[child mortality]], improve maternal health, and combat disease, including [[HIV]] and [[AIDS]].  Food-for-work programmes help promote environmental and economic stability and agricultural production.\n\n===Funding===\nThe WFP operations are funded by voluntary donations from governments of the world, corporations and private donors.

One of eleven sectoral coordination bodies, it was set by [[United Nations|UN]] [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]] resolution 46/182 in December 1991 and extended in the Humanitarian Reform of 2005, with new elements adopted to improve capacity, predictability, accountability, leadership and partnership.\n\nThe Logistics Cluster provides coordination and information management services to support operational decision-making and improve the predictability, timeliness and efficiency of humanitarian emergency responses. Where necessary, the Logistics Cluster also facilitates access to common [[logistics]] services. Due to its expertise in the field of [[Humanitarian Logistics|humanitarian logistics]], the World Food Programme (WFP) was chosen by the IASC as the lead agency for the Logistics Cluster. WFP hosts the Global Logistics Cluster support team in its headquarters in Rome.

Launched in September 2008, P4P assists [[smallholding]] farmers by offering them opportunities to access agricultural markets and to become competitive players in the marketplace. The project spanned across 20 countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America and trained 800,000 farmers in improved agricultural production, post-harvest handling, quality assurance, group marketing, agricultural finance, and contracting with the WFP. The project resulted in 366,000 metric tons of food produced and generated more than US$148 million in income for its smallholder farmers.<ref>[http://www.wfp.org/sites/default/files/P4P%20-%20Reflections%20on%20the%20pilot%2C%20February%202015.pdf Purchase for Progress: Reflections on the pilot, February 2015].

In fact, part of the response to the 2010 Haiti earthquake consisted of distributing food aid only to women as experience built up over almost five decades of working in emergency situations has demonstrated that giving food only to women helps to ensure that it is spread evenly among all household members. School-feeding and/or take-home ration programmes in 71 countries help students focus on their studies and encourage parents to send their children, especially girls, to school.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://docs.wfp.org/api/documents/3f66543adf5c482a95810d57a2b1518b/download/?_ga=2.212632660.1762357695.1495937773-1834641711.1495319110|title=Contributions to WFP: Comparative Figures and Five-Year Aggregate Ranking|last=|first=|date=2020-04-19|website=United Nations World Food Programme|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-04-21}}</ref>\n\n===Emergency Response Classifications===\nThe WFP has a system of classifications known as the Emergency Response Classifications designed for situations that require immediate response.\n\nThis response is activated under the following criteria:\n\n# When human suffering exists and domestic governments cannot respond adequately\n# The United Nations reputation is under scrutiny\n# When there is an obvious need for aid from the WFP\n\nThe Emergency Response Classifications are divided as follows, with emergency intensity increasing with each level:<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://documents.wfp.org/stellent/groups/public/documents/resources/wfp264770.pdf|title=WFP Emergency Response Classifications|date=8 May 2014|website=World Food Programme|access-date=8 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n* '''Level 1''' \u2013 Response is activated.

Auburn founded the [[Committee of 19]], which has not only led campus and community hunger awareness events but also developed a War on Hunger model for use on campuses across the country.\n\nThe WFP has launched a global advocacy and fundraising event called [[Walk the World]]. On one single day each year, hundreds of thousands of people in every time zone all over the world walk to call for the end of child hunger. In 2005, more than 200,000 people walked in 296 locations. In 2006, there were 760,000 participants in 118 countries all over the world. This event is part of the campaign to achieve the [[Millennium Development Goals]], specifically to halve the number of people who suffer from hunger and poverty by 2015.\n\nA growing number of grassroots global events and celebrations such as [[International Day of Peace]], [[World Party Day]] participants, and [[Peace One Day]] recommend the WFP on radio broadcasts as an immediate reach out action, putting help within reach of anyone with the information that a quarter feeds a child for a day.

The WFP was formally established in 1963 by the FAO and the [[United Nations General Assembly]] on a three-year experimental basis. In 1965, the programme was extended to a continuing basis.\n\n===Goals and strategies===\n[[File:Armored vehicle from the UN World Food Program.JPG|thumb|A WFP armoured vehicle.]]\nThe WFP strives to eradicate [[hunger]] and [[malnutrition]], with the ultimate goal in mind of eliminating the need for food aid itself.\n\nThe objectives that the WFP hopes to achieve are to:<ref>{{cite web |last=WFP |title=Our Work |url=http://www.wfp.org/our-work |publisher=WFP |accessdate=2 November 2013}}</ref>\n\n# \"Save lives and protect livelihoods in emergencies\"\n# \"Support food security and nutrition and (re)build livelihoods in fragile settings and following emergencies\"\n# \"Reduce risk and enable people, communities and countries to meet their own food and nutrition needs\"\n# \"Reduce under-nutrition and break the inter-generational cycle of hunger\"\n# \"Zero Hunger in 2030\"\n\nWFP food aid is also directed to fight [[micronutrient]] deficiencies, reduce [[child mortality]], improve maternal health, and combat disease, including [[HIV]] and [[AIDS]].  Food-for-work programmes help promote environmental and economic stability and agricultural production.\n\n===Funding===\nThe WFP operations are funded by voluntary donations from governments of the world, corporations and private donors.

One of eleven sectoral coordination bodies, it was set by [[United Nations|UN]] [[United Nations General Assembly|General Assembly]] resolution 46/182 in December 1991 and extended in the Humanitarian Reform of 2005, with new elements adopted to improve capacity, predictability, accountability, leadership and partnership.\n\nThe Logistics Cluster provides coordination and information management services to support operational decision-making and improve the predictability, timeliness and efficiency of humanitarian emergency responses. Where necessary, the Logistics Cluster also facilitates access to common [[logistics]] services. Due to its expertise in the field of [[Humanitarian Logistics|humanitarian logistics]], the World Food Programme (WFP) was chosen by the IASC as the lead agency for the Logistics Cluster. WFP hosts the Global Logistics Cluster support team in its headquarters in Rome. WFP also acts as a \u2018provider of last resort\u2019 offering common logistics services, when critical gaps hamper the humanitarian response.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://logcluster.org|title=Logistics Cluster|website=logcluster.org|language=en|access-date=2017-09-11}}</ref>\n\n==Activities==\n[[File:Un c-130 food delivery rumbek sudan.jpg|thumb|United Nations [[C-130 Hercules]] transports deliver food for the [[Rumbek]] region of southern [[Sudan]] (2004).]]\n\nIn 2013, the WFP reached 80.9 million people in 75 countries and provided 3.1 million tonnes of food,<ref>[http://publications.wfp.org/en/apr/2013/ The World Food Programme's Achievements in 2013].

Launched in September 2008, P4P assists [[smallholding]] farmers by offering them opportunities to access agricultural markets and to become competitive players in the marketplace. The project spanned across 20 countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America and trained 800,000 farmers in improved agricultural production, post-harvest handling, quality assurance, group marketing, agricultural finance, and contracting with the WFP. The project resulted in 366,000 metric tons of food produced and generated more than US$148 million in income for its smallholder farmers.<ref>[http://www.wfp.org/sites/default/files/P4P%20-%20Reflections%20on%20the%20pilot%2C%20February%202015.pdf Purchase for Progress: Reflections on the pilot, February 2015].

In fact, part of the response to the 2010 Haiti earthquake consisted of distributing food aid only to women as experience built up over almost five decades of working in emergency situations has demonstrated that giving food only to women helps to ensure that it is spread evenly among all household members.

Innovative ideas may be found from within WFP global staff, entrepreneurs, start-ups, companies and non-governmental organizations, and are invited to apply on a rolling basis, and through annual Innovation Challenges. Short-listed ideas may be invited to Innovation Bootcamps where innovation teams meet with professional facilitators, mentors and experts from a variety of disciplines in order to fine-tune their proposals and pitch their ideas to potential investors, business supports, and WFP operations. Successful innovations may qualify for financial support to develop the innovation, 3-6 month field testing in WFP's global operations, or scale-up support to expand proven concepts for regional or global impact. \n\nThe WFP Innovation Accelerator provides innovation services not only to WFP, but also other United Nations organizations, such as UNFPA, UNICEF, UNHCR; other non-profit or non-governmental organizations such as the [https://www.gatesfoundation.org/ Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation], the [https://humanitariangrandchallenge.org/ Humanitarian Grand Challenge], and [https://www.xprize.org/ XPRIZE]; and has partnered with various private sector companies such as [https://www.cargill.com/ Cargill], [http://www.google.com/ Google], [https://www.bcg.com/ BCG], and others.\n\nSuccessful innovations that came through the WFP Innovation Accelerator include: \n[https://innovation.wfp.org/project/h2grow-hydroponics H2Grow Hydroponics]: to grow food and animal fodder in extreme environments, using no soil and minimal water. \n[https://innovation.wfp.org/project/scope-coda SCOPE CODA]: Personal smartcards are issued to people which replace paper-based health records with digital records, and enable frontline workers track nutritional needs, and make informed decisions with real-time data. \n[https://innovation.wfp.org/project/empact EMPACT]: Digital skills training to prepare conflict-affected youth for the future of work, and enabling them to provide for themselves and their families. \n[https://sharethemeal.org ShareTheMeal]: WFP's first crowdfunding app, ShareTheMeal enables microdonations from mobile phones and its website, based on the estimation that it costs USD $0.50 to provide 1 meal.

Originally named Novonikolayevsk, it grew rapidly into a major transport, commercial and industrial hub. The city was ravaged by the [[Russian Civil War]] but recovered during the early [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] period, and gained its present name in 1926. Under [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]], Novosibirsk became one of the largest industrial centers of Siberia. Following the outbreak of the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Great Patriotic War]] the city hosted many factories relocated from European Russia.\n\nNovosibirsk is home to the headquarters of numerous Russian corporations, as well as the world-renowned [[Novosibirsk Zoo]].

The importance of the city further increased with the completion of the [[Turkestan\u2013Siberia Railway]] in the early 20th century.

In 1907, Novonikolayevsk, now with a population exceeding 47,000, was granted town status with full rights for self-government. During the pre-[[October Revolution|revolutionary]] period, the population of Novonikolayevsk reached 80,000.

In 1913, Novonikolayevsk became one of the first places in Russia to institute compulsory primary education.<ref name=all/>\n\nThe [[Russian Civil War]] took a toll on the city. Wartime epidemics, especially that of [[typhus]] and [[cholera]], claimed thousands of lives. In the course of the war, the Ob River Bridge was destroyed. For the first time in the city's history, the population of Novonikolayevsk began to decline. The Soviet Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies of Novonikolayevsk took control of the city in December 1917. In May 1918, the [[Czechoslovak Legion]] rose in opposition to the revolutionary government and, together with the [[White movement|White Guards]], captured Novonikolayevsk.

Several massive industrial facilities were created, including the 'Sibkombain' plant, specializing in the production of heavy mining equipment. Additionally a metal processing plant, a food processing plant, and other industrial enterprises and factories were built, as well as a new [[power station]]. The great [[Soviet famine of 1932\u201333]] resulted in more than 170,000 rural refugees seeking food and safety in Novosibirsk.

During this period the city also received more than 140,000 refugees.\n\nThe rapid growth of the city prompted the construction during the 1950s of a [[Novosibirsk Hydroelectric Station|hydroelectric power station]] with a capacity of 400 [[megawatt]]s,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.utopiasprings.com/instnovo.htm|title=Novosibirsk, Siberia, Russia History & Info|publisher=Utopiasprings.com|date=|accessdate=May 6, 2009}}</ref> necessitating the creation of a giant water reservoir, now known as the [[Novosibirsk Reservoir|Ob Sea]].

The Siberian Division of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] (formerly the [[Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union]]) has its headquarters in Akademgorodok, and the town hosts more than 35 research institutes and universities, among them [[Novosibirsk State University]], one of the top Russian schools in Natural Sciences and Mathematics. Although it possesses a fully autonomous infrastructure, Akademgorodok is administered by Novosibirsk.\n\nOn September 2, 1962, the population of Novosibirsk reached one million.

The reason for these temperatures is the absence of a nearby ocean, the [[Ural Mountains]] barring Atlantic air masses from reaching Siberia, and the lack of tall mountains at the north of Novosibirsk that could have held back freezing Arctic winds. In fact, Novosibirsk is the second-farthest substantially populated city from the ocean, the first being [[\u00dcr\u00fcmqi]] in China.\n\nThe climate is [[humid continental climate|humid continental]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]] ''Dfb''), with warm summers and bitterly cold winters. Novosibirsk is frequently cloudy in the winter due to the collision of Atlantic and Siberian air masses. Snow is frequent, falling on almost half of all winter days, but individual snowfalls are usually light. On average temperatures range in summer from {{convert|+15|C}} to {{convert|+26|C}} and in winter from {{convert|-20|C}} to {{convert|-12|C}}. However, winter temperatures can go as low as {{convert|-30|C}} to {{convert|-35|C}}, and summer temperatures can go as high as {{convert|+30|C}} to {{convert|+35|C}}.

Originally named Novonikolayevsk, it grew rapidly into a major transport, commercial and industrial hub. The city was ravaged by the [[Russian Civil War]] but recovered during the early [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] period, and gained its present name in 1926. Under [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]], Novosibirsk became one of the largest industrial centers of Siberia. Following the outbreak of the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Great Patriotic War]] the city hosted many factories relocated from European Russia.\n\nNovosibirsk is home to the headquarters of numerous Russian corporations, as well as the world-renowned [[Novosibirsk Zoo]].

The importance of the city further increased with the completion of the [[Turkestan\u2013Siberia Railway]] in the early 20th century.

In 1907, Novonikolayevsk, now with a population exceeding 47,000, was granted town status with full rights for self-government. During the pre-[[October Revolution|revolutionary]] period, the population of Novonikolayevsk reached 80,000.

In 1913, Novonikolayevsk became one of the first places in Russia to institute compulsory primary education.<ref name=all/>\n\nThe [[Russian Civil War]] took a toll on the city. Wartime epidemics, especially that of [[typhus]] and [[cholera]], claimed thousands of lives. In the course of the war, the Ob River Bridge was destroyed. For the first time in the city's history, the population of Novonikolayevsk began to decline. The Soviet Workers' and Soldiers' Deputies of Novonikolayevsk took control of the city in December 1917. In May 1918, the [[Czechoslovak Legion]] rose in opposition to the revolutionary government and, together with the [[White movement|White Guards]], captured Novonikolayevsk.

Several massive industrial facilities were created, including the 'Sibkombain' plant, specializing in the production of heavy mining equipment. Additionally a metal processing plant, a food processing plant, and other industrial enterprises and factories were built, as well as a new [[power station]]. The great [[Soviet famine of 1932\u201333]] resulted in more than 170,000 rural refugees seeking food and safety in Novosibirsk.

During this period the city also received more than 140,000 refugees.\n\nThe rapid growth of the city prompted the construction during the 1950s of a [[Novosibirsk Hydroelectric Station|hydroelectric power station]] with a capacity of 400 [[megawatt]]s,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.utopiasprings.com/instnovo.htm|title=Novosibirsk, Siberia, Russia History & Info|publisher=Utopiasprings.com|date=|accessdate=May 6, 2009}}</ref> necessitating the creation of a giant water reservoir, now known as the [[Novosibirsk Reservoir|Ob Sea]]. As a direct result of the station's construction, vast areas of fertile land were flooded as were relic pine woods in the area; additionally, the new open space created by the reservoir's surface caused average wind speeds to double, increasing the rate of [[erosion|soil erosion]].<ref name=all/>\n\nIn the 1950s, the Soviet Government directed that a center for scientific research be built in Novosibirsk, and in 1957 the multi-facility [[science|scientific]] [[research]] complex of [[Akademgorodok]] was constructed about {{convert|30|km|sp=us||abbr=on}} south of the city center. The Siberian Division of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]] (formerly the [[Academy of Sciences of the Soviet Union]]) has its headquarters in Akademgorodok, and the town hosts more than 35 research institutes and universities, among them [[Novosibirsk State University]], one of the top Russian schools in Natural Sciences and Mathematics. Although it possesses a fully autonomous infrastructure, Akademgorodok is administered by Novosibirsk.\n\nOn September 2, 1962, the population of Novosibirsk reached one million.

Some [[sorbus aucuparia|mountain ash]], [[crataegus monogyna|hawthorn]], [[spruce]], and [[fir]] are also present. European species of [[apple]], [[fraxinus|ash]], [[elm]], [[tilia|linden]], and [[oak]] have been successfully introduced.\n\n==Geography==\n===Location===\nThe city stands on the banks of the Ob River in the [[West Siberian Plain]]. To the south of the city lies the Priobskoye Plateau. The nearest major cities are [[Krasnoyarsk]], [[Omsk]] and [[Nur-Sultan]].\n[[File:\u0411\u0443\u0433\u0440\u0438\u043d\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u043c\u043e\u0441\u0442 \u041d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0441\u0438\u0431\u0438\u0440\u0441\u043a II.PNG|right|300px|thumb|[[Bugrinsky Bridge]] on the [[Ob River]]]]\n\n===Climate===\nThe climate in Novosibirsk is typical of Siberia, with dry winters and far-below-freezing winter temperatures. The reason for these temperatures is the absence of a nearby ocean, the [[Ural Mountains]] barring Atlantic air masses from reaching Siberia, and the lack of tall mountains at the north of Novosibirsk that could have held back freezing Arctic winds. In fact, Novosibirsk is the second-farthest substantially populated city from the ocean, the first being [[\u00dcr\u00fcmqi]] in China.\n\nThe climate is [[humid continental climate|humid continental]] ([[K\u00f6ppen climate classification|K\u00f6ppen]] ''Dfb''), with warm summers and bitterly cold winters. Novosibirsk is frequently cloudy in the winter due to the collision of Atlantic and Siberian air masses. Snow is frequent, falling on almost half of all winter days, but individual snowfalls are usually light. On average temperatures range in summer from {{convert|+15|C}} to {{convert|+26|C}} and in winter from {{convert|-20|C}} to {{convert|-12|C}}. However, winter temperatures can go as low as {{convert|-30|C}} to {{convert|-35|C}}, and summer temperatures can go as high as {{convert|+30|C}} to {{convert|+35|C}}. The difference between the highest- and lowest-recorded temperatures is {{convert|82|C-change|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nTravellers coming from countries with mild climates may find Novosibirsk's winter tough, but it may not be extraordinary for those from northern countries. At times, bitter cold may hold for some days, but temperatures of {{convert|-40|C}} and lower do not occur every year. In the springtime, streets and roads become dirty as a result of mud and melting snow, while the weather is still cold.\n\n{{Weather box\n|width=auto\n|location=Novosibirsk (1958\u20132019)\n|metric first=yes\n|single line=yes\n|Jan record high C=4.1\n|Feb record high C=5.1\n|Mar record high C=14.4\n|Apr record high C=30.7\n|May record high C=36.1\n|Jun record high C=36.6\n|Jul record high C=35.9\n|Aug record high C=35.7\n|Sep record high C=33.2\n|Oct record high C=27.2\n|Nov record high C=11.5\n|Dec record high C=4.8\n|year record high C=36.6\n|Jan high C=-12.1\n|Feb high C=-9.7\n|Mar high C=-1.9\n|Apr high C=8.1\n|May high C=18.8\n|Jun high C=23.4\n|Jul high C=25.4\n|Aug high C=22.8\n|Sep high C=16.0\n|Oct high C=7.6\n|Nov high C=-3.5\n|Dec high C = -9.9\n|year high C = 7.1\n| Jan mean C = -16.5\n| Feb mean C = -14.8\n| Mar mean C = -7.6\n| Apr mean C = 2.3\n| May mean C = 11.8\n| Jun mean C = 17.1\n| Jul mean C = 19.4\n| Aug mean C = 16.6\n| Sep mean C = 10.2\n| Oct mean C = 3.1\n| Nov mean C = -6.9\n| Dec mean C = -14.0\n|year mean C = 1.7\n|Jan low C = \u221220.9\n|Feb low C = \u221219.5\n|Mar low C = -12.8\n|Apr low C = -2.4\n|May low C = 5.6\n|Jun low C = 11.2\n|Jul low C = 13.8\n|Aug low C = 11.2\n|Sep low C = 5.6\n|Oct low C = -0.4\n|Nov low C = \u221210.3\n|Dec low C = \u221218.3\n|year low C = -3.1\n|Jan record low C = \u221246.2\n|Feb record low C = \u221246.3\n|Mar record low C = \u221236.4\n|Apr record low C = \u221229.1\n|May record low C = \u22128.6\n|Jun record low C = -2.2\n|Jul record low C = 1.5\n|Aug record low C = 0.0\n|Sep record low C = \u22126.9\n|Oct record low C = \u221226.4\n|Nov record low C = \u221240.0\n|Dec record low C = \u221245.7\n|year record low C = \u221246.3\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation mm = 25\n|Feb precipitation mm = 18\n|Mar precipitation mm = 17\n|Apr precipitation mm = 27\n|May precipitation mm = 34\n|Jun precipitation mm = 55\n|Jul precipitation mm = 66\n|Aug precipitation mm = 60\n|Sep precipitation mm = 43\n|Oct precipitation mm = 45\n|Nov precipitation mm = 37\n|Dec precipitation mm = 33\n|year precipitation mm = 460\n|Jan humidity = 82\n|Feb humidity = 81\n|Mar humidity = 77\n|Apr humidity = 65\n|May humidity = 58\n|Jun humidity = 66\n|Jul humidity = 73\n|Aug humidity = 75\n|Sep humidity = 75\n|Oct humidity = 78\n|Nov humidity = 83\n|Dec humidity = 83\n|year humidity = 75\n|Jan rain days = 1\n|Feb rain days = 1\n|Mar rain days = 2\n|Apr rain days = 8\n|May rain days = 13\n|Jun rain days = 14\n|Jul rain days = 14\n|Aug rain days = 14\n|Sep rain days = 16\n|Oct rain days = 12\n|Nov rain days = 5\n|Dec rain days = 1\n|year rain days = 101\n|Jan snow days = 23\n|Feb snow days = 19\n|Mar snow days = 15\n|Apr snow days = 9\n|May snow days = 3\n|Jun snow days = 0.1\n|Jul snow days = 0\n|Aug snow days = 0\n|Sep snow days = 1\n|Oct snow days = 11\n|Nov snow days = 20\n|Dec snow days = 25\n|year snow days = 126\n|Jan sun = 67\n|Feb sun = 107\n|Mar sun = 166\n|Apr sun = 213\n|May sun = 264\n|Jun sun = 302\n|Jul sun = 304\n|Aug sun = 245\n|Sep sun = 170\n|Oct sun = 100\n|Nov sun = 58\n|Dec sun = 45\n|year sun =\n|source 1 =Pogoda.ru.net<ref name = Pogoda >\n{{cite web\n|url = http://www.pogodaiklimat.ru/climate/29638.htm\n|title = Weather and Climate-The Climate of Novosibirsk\n|publisher = Weather and Climate\n|language = Russian\n|accessdate = May 5, 2016}}</ref>\n|source 2 = [[Danish Meteorological Institute]] (sun, 1931\u20131960)<ref name=DMI>{{cite web | last1 = Cappelen | first1 = John | last2 = Jensen | first2 = Jens | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130427173827/http://www.dmi.dk/dmi/tr01-17.pdf | archivedate = April 27, 2013 | url = http://www.dmi.dk/dmi/tr01-17.pdf | work = Climate Data for Selected Stations (1931-1960) | title = Rusland -

Along with the [[triple jump]], the two events that measure jumping for distance as a group are referred to as the \"horizontal jumps\". This event has a history in the [[Ancient Olympic Games]] and has been a modern Olympic event for men since the first Olympics in 1896 and for women since 1948.\n\n==Rules==\n[[File:Wind indicator in long jump area at TNT - Fortuna Meeting in Kladno 16June2010 118.jpg|thumb|An indicator of wind direction and a device for measuring wind speed (here +2.6&nbsp;m/s) along a run-up track.]]\nAt the elite level, competitors run down a runway (usually coated with the same [[All-weather running track|rubberized surface]] as running tracks, [[crumb rubber]] also [[vulcanized rubber]]\u2014known generally as an [[all-weather track]]) and jump as far as they can from a wooden board 20&nbsp;cm or 8&nbsp;inches wide that is built flush with the runway into a pit filled with finely ground gravel or sand. If the competitor starts the leap with any part of the foot past the foul line, the jump is declared a foul and no distance is recorded. A layer of [[plasticine]] is placed immediately after the board to detect this occurrence. An official (similar to a [[referee]]) will also watch the jump and make the determination. The competitor can initiate the jump from any point behind the foul line; however, the distance measured will always be perpendicular to the foul line to the nearest break in the sand caused by any part of the body or uniform. Therefore, it is in the best interest of the competitor to get as close to the foul line as possible. Competitors are allowed to place two marks along the side of the runway in order to assist them to jump accurately. At a lesser meet and facilities, the plasticine will likely not exist, the runway might be a different surface or jumpers may initiate their jump from a painted or taped mark on the runway. At a smaller meet, the number of attempts might also be limited to four or three.\n\nEach competitor has a set number of attempts. That would normally be three trials, with three additional jumps being awarded to the best 8 or 9 (depending on the number of lanes on the track at that facility, so the event is equatable to track events) competitors. All legal marks will be recorded but only the longest legal jump counts towards the results. The competitor with the longest legal jump (from either the trial or final rounds) at the end of competition is declared the winner. In the event of an exact tie, then comparing the next best jumps of the tied competitors will be used to determine place. In a large, multi-day elite competition (like the Olympics or [[IAAF World Championships in Athletics|World Championships]]), a set number of competitors will advance to the final round, determined in advance by the meet management. A set of 3 trial round jumps will be held in order to select those finalists. It is standard practice to allow at a minimum, one more competitor than the number of scoring positions to return to the final round, though 12 plus ties and automatic qualifying distances are also potential factors.

All events that occurred at the Olympic Games were initially supposed to act as a form of training for warfare. The long jump emerged probably because it mirrored the crossing of obstacles such as streams and ravines.<ref name=\"AOG_book\">{{cite book|author=Judith Swaddling|title=The Ancient Olympic Games|publisher=University of Texas Pres|isbn=0292777515|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/ancientolympicga00swad}}</ref> After investigating the surviving depictions of the ancient event it is believed that unlike the modern event, athletes were only allowed a short running start.<ref name=\"AOG_book\" /> The athletes carried a weight in each hand, which were called [[Halteres (ancient Greece)|halteres]] (between 1 and 4.5&nbsp;kg). These weights were swung forward as the athlete jumped in order to increase momentum. It was commonly believed that the jumper would throw the weights behind him in midair to increase his forward momentum; however, halteres were held throughout the duration of the jump. Swinging them down and back at the end of the jump would change the athlete's center of gravity and allow the athlete to stretch his legs outward, increasing his distance. The jump itself was made from the ''bater'' (\"that which is trod upon\"). It was most likely a simple board placed on the stadium track which was removed after the event. The jumpers would land in what was called a ''skamma'' (\"dug-up\" area). The idea that this was a pit full of sand is wrong. Sand in the jumping pit is a modern invention.<ref name=\"Stephen G. Miller 2004, p.66\">[[#Miller|Miller]], p. 66</ref> The ''skamma'' was simply a temporary area dug up for that occasion and not something that remained over time.\n\nThe long jump was considered one of the most difficult of the events held at the Games since a great deal of skill was required. Music was often played during the jump and Philostratus says that pipes at times would accompany the jump so as to provide a rhythm for the complex movements of the halteres by the athlete.<ref name=\"AOG_book\" /> Philostratus  is quoted as saying, \"The rules regard jumping as the most difficult of the competitions, and they allow the jumper to be given advantages in rhythm by the use of the flute, and in weight by the use of the halter.\"<ref>[[#Miller|Miller]], p. 67</ref> Most notable in the ancient sport was a man called [[Chionis of Sparta|Chionis]], who in the 656 BC Olympics staged a jump of 7.05&nbsp;metres (23&nbsp;feet and 1.7&nbsp;inches).<ref name=\"ancient_origins\">{{cite web | url = http://www.times-olympics.co.uk/communities/athletics/athleticsancient.html | archiveurl = https://archive.is/20070311052052/http://www.times-olympics.co.uk/communities/athletics/athleticsancient.html | archivedate = 11 March 2007 | title = Ancient Origins | accessdate = 29 October 2006 | publisher = The Times/The Sunday Times }}</ref>\n\nThere has been some argument by modern scholars over the long jump. Some have attempted to recreate it as a [[triple jump]]. The images provide the only evidence for the action so it is more well received that it was much like today's long jump. The main reason some want to call it a triple jump is the presence of a source that claims there once was a fifty-five ancient foot jump done by a man named Phayllos.<ref>[[#Miller|Miller]], p. 68</ref>\n\nThe long jump has been part of pewdiepie's life inception.

Speed in the run-up, or approach, and a high leap off the board are the fundamentals of success. Because speed is such an important factor of the approach, it is not surprising that many long jumpers also compete successfully in sprints. A classic example of this long jump / sprint doubling are performances by [[Carl Lewis]].\n\n===The approach===\nThe objective of the approach is to gradually accelerate to a maximum controlled speed at takeoff. The most important factor for the distance travelled by an object is its [[velocity]] at takeoff \u2013 both the speed and angle. Elite jumpers usually leave the ground at an angle of twenty degrees or less; therefore, it is more beneficial for a jumper to focus on the speed component of the jump. The greater the speed at takeoff, the longer the trajectory of the center of mass will be. The importance of a takeoff speed is a factor in the success of sprinters in this event.\n\nThe length of the approach is usually consistent distance for an athlete. Approaches can vary between 12 and 19 strides on the novice and intermediate levels, while at the elite level they are closer to between 20 and 22 strides. The exact distance and number of strides in an approach depends on the jumper's experience, sprinting technique, and conditioning level. Consistency in the approach is important as it is the competitor's objective to get as close to the front of the takeoff board as possible without crossing the line with any part of the foot.\n\nInconsistent approaches are a common problem in the event. As a result, the approach is usually practiced by athletes about 6\u20138 times per jumping session (see [[Long Jump#Training|Training]] below).\n\n===The last two strides===\nThe objective of the last two strides is to prepare the body for takeoff while conserving as much speed as possible.\n\nThe penultimate stride is longer than the last stride. The competitor begins to lower his or her center of gravity to prepare the body for the vertical impulse. The final stride is shorter because the body is beginning to raise the center of gravity in preparation for takeoff.\n\nThe last two strides are extremely important because they determine the velocity with which the competitor will enter the jump.\n\n===Takeoff===\n[[File:Long jump takeoff board.jpg|thumb|right|Takeoff board]]\nThe objective of the takeoff is to create a vertical impulse through the athlete's center of gravity while maintaining balance and control.\n\nThis phase is one of the most technical parts of the long jump. Jumpers must be conscious to place the foot flat on the ground, because jumping off either the heels or the toes negatively affects the jump. Taking off from the board heel-first has a braking effect, which decreases velocity and strains the joints. Jumping off the toes decreases stability, putting the leg at risk of buckling or collapsing from underneath the jumper. While concentrating on foot placement, the athlete must also work to maintain proper body position, keeping the torso upright and moving the hips forward and up to achieve the maximum distance from board contact to foot release.\n\nThere are four main styles of takeoff: the kick style, double-arm style, sprint takeoff, and the power sprint or bounding takeoff.\n\n====Kick====\nThe kick style takeoff is where the athlete actively cycles the leg before a full impulse has been directed into the board then landing into the pit. This requires great strength in the hamstrings. This causes the jumper to jump to large distances.\n\n====Double-arm====\nThe double-arm style of takeoff works by moving both arms in a vertical direction as the competitor takes off. This produces a high hip height and a large vertical impulse.\n\n====Sprint====\nThe sprint takeoff is the style most widely instructed by coaching staff. This is a classic single-arm action that resembles a jumper in full stride. It is an efficient takeoff style for maintaining velocity through takeoff.\n\n====Power sprint or bounding====\nThe power sprint takeoff, or bounding takeoff, is one of the more common elite styles. Very similar to the sprint style, the body resembles a sprinter in full stride. However, there is one major difference. The arm that pushes back on takeoff (the arm on the side of the takeoff leg) fully extends backward, rather than remaining at a bent position. This additional extension increases the impulse at takeoff.\n\nThe \"correct\" style of takeoff will vary from athlete to athlete.\n[[File:Jessica Ennis - long jump - 3.jpg|right|thumb|[[Heptathlon|Multi-eventer]] [[Jessica Ennis]] during a long jump, preparing to land]]\n\n===Action in the air and landing===\nThere are three major flight techniques for the long jump: the hang, the sail, and the hitch-kick. Each technique is to combat the forward rotation experienced from take-off but is basically down to preference from the athlete. It is important to note that once the body is airborne, there is nothing that the athlete can do to change the direction they are traveling and consequently where they are going to land in the pit. However, it can be argued that certain techniques influence an athlete's landing, which can affect the distance measured. For example, if an athlete lands feet first but falls back because they are not correctly balanced, a lower distance will be measured.\n\nIn the 1970s some jumpers used a forward somersault, including [[Tuariki Delamere]] who used it at the 1974 [[NCAA]] Championships, and who matched the jump of the current Olympic champion [[Randy Williams]]. The somersault jump has potential to produce longer jumps than other techniques because in the flip, no power is lost countering forward momentum, and it reduces wind resistance in the air.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Flip That Led To A Flap |author=Ron Reid |date=29 July 1974 |work=Sports Illustrated |url=https://www.si.com/vault/1974/07/29/616167/the-flip-that-led-to-a-flap |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203190409/http://si.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1088829/index.htm |archivedate=3 February 2014}}</ref> The front flip jump was subsequently banned due to fear of it being unsafe.\n\n==Training==\nThe long jump generally requires training in a variety of areas. These areas include: speed work, jumping, over distance running, weight training, plyometric training.\n\n===Speed work===\nSpeed work is essentially short distance speed training where the athlete would be running at top or near top speeds. The distances for this type of work would vary between indoor and outdoor season but are usually around 30\u201360 m for indoors and up to 100 m for outdoors.\n\n===Jumping===\nLong Jumpers tend to practice jumping 1\u20132 times a week. Approaches, or run-throughs, are repeated sometimes up to 6\u20138 times per session.\nShort approach jumps are common for jumpers to do, as it allows for them to work on specific technical aspects of their jumps in a controlled environment. Using equipment such as low hurdles and other obstacles are common in long jump training, as it helps the jumper maintain and hold phases of their jump. As a common rule, it is important for the jumper to engage in full approach jumps at least once a week, as it will prepare the jumper for competition.\n\n===Over-distance running===\nOver-distance running workouts helps the athlete jump a further distance than their set goal. For example, having a 100 m runner practice by running 200 m repeats on a track. This is specifically concentrated in the season when athletes are working on building [[endurance]]. Specific over-distance running workouts are performed 1\u20132 times a week. This is great for building sprint endurance, which is required in competitions where the athlete is sprinting down the runway 3\u20136 times. Typical workouts would include 5\u00d7150 m. Preseason workouts may be longer, including workouts like 6\u00d7300 m.\n\n===Weight training===\nDuring pre-season training and early in the competition season weight training tends to play a major role in the sport. It is customary for a long jumper to weight train up to 4 times a week, focusing mainly on quick movements involving the legs and trunk. Some athletes perform Olympic lifts in training. Athletes use low repetition and emphasize speed to maximize the strength increase while minimizing adding additional weight to their frame. Important lifts for a long jumper include the back squat, front squat, power cleans and hang cleans. The emphasis on these lifts should be on speed and explosive as those are crucial in the long jump take off phase.\n\n===Plyometrics===\n[[Plyometrics]], including running up and down stairs and hurdle bounding, can be incorporated into workouts, generally twice a week. This allows an athlete to work on agility and explosiveness. Other plyometric workouts that are common for long jumpers are box jumps. Boxes of various heights are set up spaced evenly apart and jumpers can proceed jumping onto them and off moving in a forward direction. They can vary the jumps from both legs to single jumps. Alternatively, they can set up the boxes in front of a high jump mat if allowed, and jump over a high jump bar onto the mat mimicking a landing phase of the jump. These plyometric workouts are typically performed at the end of a workout.\n\n===Bounding===\nBounding is any sort of continuous jumping or leaping. Bounding drills usually require single leg bounding, double-leg bounding, or some variation of the two. <!-- (commented out because this is not bounding, it is a different type of plyometrics) It can also include box drills or depth jumps.--> The focus of bounding drills is usually to spend as little time on the ground as possible and working on technical accuracy, fluidity, and jumping endurance and strength. Technically, bounding is part of plyometrics, as a form of a running exercise such as high knees and butt kicks.\n\n===Flexibility===\n[[Flexibility (anatomy)|Flexibility]] is an often forgotten{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} tool for long jumpers. Effective flexibility prevents injury, which can be important for high-impact events such as the long jump. It also helps the athlete sprint down the runway.\nHip and groin injuries are common for long jumpers who may neglect proper warm-up and stretching.\n\nHurdle mobility drills are a common way that jumpers improve flexibility. Common hurdle drills include setting up about 5\u20137 hurdles at appropriate heights and having athletes walk over them in a continuous fashion. Other variations of hurdle mobility drills are used as well, including hurdle skips.\nThis is a crucial part of a jumper's training since they perform most exercises for a very short period of time and often aren't aware of their form and technique.\nA common tool in many long jump workouts is the use of [[Video tape recording|video taping]]. This enables the athlete to go back and watch their own progress as well as letting the athlete compare their own footage to that of some of the world-class jumpers.\n\nTraining styles, duration, and intensity vary immensely from athlete to athlete and are based on the experience and strength of the athlete as well as on their coaching style.\n\n== Culture ==\n[[File:2003 Greece 10 Euro OS Long Jump front.jpg|thumb|[[Euro gold and silver commemorative coins (Greece)#2003 coinage|Long Jump commemorative coin]]]]\n\nTrack and field events have been selected as a main motif in numerous collectors' coins. One of the recent samples is the \u20ac10 Greek [[Euro gold and silver commemorative coins (Greece)#2003 coinage|Long Jump commemorative coin]], minted in 2003 to commemorate the [[2004 Summer Olympics]]. The obverse of the coin portrays a modern athlete at the moment he is touching the ground, while the ancient athlete in the background is shown while starting off his jump, as he is seen on a black-figure vase of the 5th century BC.\n\n==Records==\n[[File:50 a\u00f1os de M\u00e9xico 68 - 16.jpg|thumb|Sand pit where Bob Beamon set the 8.90 m record in Mexico City, Mexico.]]\nThe men's long jump world record has been held by just four individuals for the majority of time since the [[IAAF]] started to ratify records.  The first mark recognized by the [[IAAF]] in 1912, the 1901 performance by [[Peter O'Connor (athlete)|Peter O'Connor]], stood just short of 20 years (nine years as an IAAF record). After it was broken in 1921, the record changed hands six times until [[Jesse Owens]] set the record at the 1935 [[Big Ten Conference|Big Ten]] track meet in Ann Arbor, Michigan, of {{T&Fcalc|8.13}} that was not broken for 25 years and 2 months, until 1960, by [[Ralph Boston]]. Boston improved upon it and exchanged records with [[Igor Ter-Ovanesyan]] seven times over the next seven years.  At the [[1968 Summer Olympics]] [[Bob Beamon]] jumped {{convert|8.90|m|ftin|2|abbr=on}}, a jump not exceeded for 23 years, and which remains the second longest legal jump of all time; yet it has stood as the Olympic record for {{years ago|1968}} years. On 30 August 1991 [[Mike Powell (athlete)|Mike Powell]] of the United States set the current men's world record at the [[1991 World Championships in Athletics|World Championships]] in Tokyo.  It was in a [[1991 World Championships in Athletics \u2013 Men's long jump|dramatic showdown]] against [[Carl Lewis]], who also surpassed Beamon's record that day but with an aiding wind (thus not legal for record purposes).  Powell's record {{convert|8.95|m|ftin|2|abbr=on}} has now stood for over {{years ago|1991|08|30}} years.\n\nSome jumps over {{T&Fcalc|8.95}} have been officially recorded. {{T&Fcalc|8.99}} was recorded by Powell (wind-aided +4.4) set at high altitude in [[Sestriere]], Italy, in 1992. A potential world record of {{T&Fcalc|8.96}} was recorded by [[Iv\u00e1n Pedroso]],<ref>[http://www.iaaf.org/statistics/toplists/inout=o/age=n/season=0/sex=M/all=y/legal=A/disc=LJ/detail.html 100 Metres \u2013 men \u2013 senior \u2013 outdoor]. iaaf.org.

Retrieved on 2013-04-20.</ref> As mentioned above, Lewis jumped 8.91 m moments before Powell's record-breaking jump with the wind exceeding the maximum allowed.  This jump remains the longest ever not to win an Olympic or World Championship gold medal, or any competition in general.\n\nThe women's world record has seen more consistent improvement, though the current record has stood longer than any long jump record by men or women.  The longest to hold the record prior was by [[Fanny Blankers-Koen]] during [[World War II]]. who held it for 10 years.  There have been three occasions where the record was tied or improved upon twice in the same competition. The current world record for women is held by [[Galina Chistyakova]] of the former Soviet Union who leapt {{convert|7.52|m|ftin|2|abbr=on}} in [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]] on 11 June 1988, a mark that has stood for over {{years ago|1988|06|11}} years.\n\n==All-time top 25 long jumpers==\n{{see also|Men's long jump world record progression|Women's long jump world record progression}}\n\n===Men===\n* {{As of|2020|02|01}}.<ref name=AlltimeMO>[http://www.iaaf.org/records/toplists/jumps/long-jump/outdoor/men/senior Long Jump \u2013 men \u2013 senior \u2013 outdoor].

Along with the [[triple jump]], the two events that measure jumping for distance as a group are referred to as the \"horizontal jumps\". This event has a history in the [[Ancient Olympic Games]] and has been a modern Olympic event for men since the first Olympics in 1896 and for women since 1948.\n\n==Rules==\n[[File:Wind indicator in long jump area at TNT - Fortuna Meeting in Kladno 16June2010 118.jpg|thumb|An indicator of wind direction and a device for measuring wind speed (here +2.6&nbsp;m/s) along a run-up track.]]\nAt the elite level, competitors run down a runway (usually coated with the same [[All-weather running track|rubberized surface]] as running tracks, [[crumb rubber]] also [[vulcanized rubber]]\u2014known generally as an [[all-weather track]]) and jump as far as they can from a wooden board 20&nbsp;cm or 8&nbsp;inches wide that is built flush with the runway into a pit filled with finely ground gravel or sand. If the competitor starts the leap with any part of the foot past the foul line, the jump is declared a foul and no distance is recorded. A layer of [[plasticine]] is placed immediately after the board to detect this occurrence. An official (similar to a [[referee]]) will also watch the jump and make the determination. The competitor can initiate the jump from any point behind the foul line; however, the distance measured will always be perpendicular to the foul line to the nearest break in the sand caused by any part of the body or uniform. Therefore, it is in the best interest of the competitor to get as close to the foul line as possible. Competitors are allowed to place two marks along the side of the runway in order to assist them to jump accurately. At a lesser meet and facilities, the plasticine will likely not exist, the runway might be a different surface or jumpers may initiate their jump from a painted or taped mark on the runway. At a smaller meet, the number of attempts might also be limited to four or three.\n\nEach competitor has a set number of attempts. That would normally be three trials, with three additional jumps being awarded to the best 8 or 9 (depending on the number of lanes on the track at that facility, so the event is equatable to track events) competitors. All legal marks will be recorded but only the longest legal jump counts towards the results. The competitor with the longest legal jump (from either the trial or final rounds) at the end of competition is declared the winner. In the event of an exact tie, then comparing the next best jumps of the tied competitors will be used to determine place. In a large, multi-day elite competition (like the Olympics or [[IAAF World Championships in Athletics|World Championships]]), a set number of competitors will advance to the final round, determined in advance by the meet management. A set of 3 trial round jumps will be held in order to select those finalists. It is standard practice to allow at a minimum, one more competitor than the number of scoring positions to return to the final round, though 12 plus ties and automatic qualifying distances are also potential factors. (For specific rules and regulations in United States Track & Field see Rule 185).<ref name=\"usatf\">{{cite web| url = http://www.usatf.com/about/rules/2006/| title = USATF \u2013 2006 Competition Rules| accessdate = 29 October 2006| publisher = USA Track & Field }}\n:*See Rule 185 in [http://www.usatf.com/about/rules/2006/2006USATFRules_Article3.pdf ''Article III'']</ref>\n\nFor record purposes, the maximum accepted [[wind assistance]] is two metres per second (m/s) (4.5&nbsp;mph).\n\n==History==\n[[File:Long jump Ancient Greeece.jpg|thumb|The jumper on the left performs a distinctive [[Isometric exercise#Isometric presses as preparation for explosive power movements|isometric press]], primarily by applying downward pressure onto his bent rear leg.

All events that occurred at the Olympic Games were initially supposed to act as a form of training for warfare. The long jump emerged probably because it mirrored the crossing of obstacles such as streams and ravines.<ref name=\"AOG_book\">{{cite book|author=Judith Swaddling|title=The Ancient Olympic Games|publisher=University of Texas Pres|isbn=0292777515|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/ancientolympicga00swad}}</ref> After investigating the surviving depictions of the ancient event it is believed that unlike the modern event, athletes were only allowed a short running start.<ref name=\"AOG_book\" /> The athletes carried a weight in each hand, which were called [[Halteres (ancient Greece)|halteres]] (between 1 and 4.5&nbsp;kg). These weights were swung forward as the athlete jumped in order to increase momentum. It was commonly believed that the jumper would throw the weights behind him in midair to increase his forward momentum; however, halteres were held throughout the duration of the jump. Swinging them down and back at the end of the jump would change the athlete's center of gravity and allow the athlete to stretch his legs outward, increasing his distance. The jump itself was made from the ''bater'' (\"that which is trod upon\"). It was most likely a simple board placed on the stadium track which was removed after the event. The jumpers would land in what was called a ''skamma'' (\"dug-up\" area). The idea that this was a pit full of sand is wrong. Sand in the jumping pit is a modern invention.<ref name=\"Stephen G. Miller 2004, p.66\">[[#Miller|Miller]], p. 66</ref> The ''skamma'' was simply a temporary area dug up for that occasion and not something that remained over time.\n\nThe long jump was considered one of the most difficult of the events held at the Games since a great deal of skill was required. Music was often played during the jump and Philostratus says that pipes at times would accompany the jump so as to provide a rhythm for the complex movements of the halteres by the athlete.<ref name=\"AOG_book\" /> Philostratus  is quoted as saying, \"The rules regard jumping as the most difficult of the competitions, and they allow the jumper to be given advantages in rhythm by the use of the flute, and in weight by the use of the halter.\"<ref>[[#Miller|Miller]], p. 67</ref> Most notable in the ancient sport was a man called [[Chionis of Sparta|Chionis]], who in the 656 BC Olympics staged a jump of 7.05&nbsp;metres (23&nbsp;feet and 1.7&nbsp;inches).<ref name=\"ancient_origins\">{{cite web | url = http://www.times-olympics.co.uk/communities/athletics/athleticsancient.html | archiveurl = https://archive.is/20070311052052/http://www.times-olympics.co.uk/communities/athletics/athleticsancient.html | archivedate = 11 March 2007 | title = Ancient Origins | accessdate = 29 October 2006 | publisher = The Times/The Sunday Times }}</ref>\n\nThere has been some argument by modern scholars over the long jump. Some have attempted to recreate it as a [[triple jump]]. The images provide the only evidence for the action so it is more well received that it was much like today's long jump. The main reason some want to call it a triple jump is the presence of a source that claims there once was a fifty-five ancient foot jump done by a man named Phayllos.<ref>[[#Miller|Miller]], p. 68</ref>\n\nThe long jump has been part of modern Olympic competition since the inception of the [[Summer Olympic Games|Games]] in 1896. In 1914, Dr. Harry Eaton Stewart recommended the \"running broad jump\" as a standardized track and field event for women.<ref name=\"Tricard\">{{cite book | last = Tricard | first = Louise Mead | title = American Women's Track & Field: A History, 1895 Through 1980| date= 1 July 1996 | publisher = McFarland & Company | isbn = 0-7864-0219-9 | pages = 60\u201361}}</ref> However, it was not until 1948 that the women's long jump was added to the [[Athletics at the Olympics|Olympic athletics programme]].\n\n==Technique==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=August 2011}}\n[[File:Women heptathlon LJ French Athletics Championships 2013 t144221.jpg|thumbnail|upright=1.25|Emmanuelle Chazal competes in the women's heptathlon long jump final during the French Athletics Championships 2013 at [[Stade Charl\u00e9ty]] in Paris, 13 July 2013.]]\nThere are five main components of the long jump: the approach run, the last two strides, takeoff, action in the air, and landing. Speed in the run-up, or approach, and a high leap off the board are the fundamentals of success. Because speed is such an important factor of the approach, it is not surprising that many long jumpers also compete successfully in sprints. A classic example of this long jump / sprint doubling are performances by [[Carl Lewis]].\n\n===The approach===\nThe objective of the approach is to gradually accelerate to a maximum controlled speed at takeoff. The most important factor for the distance travelled by an object is its [[velocity]] at takeoff \u2013 both the speed and angle. Elite jumpers usually leave the ground at an angle of twenty degrees or less; therefore, it is more beneficial for a jumper to focus on the speed component of the jump. The greater the speed at takeoff, the longer the trajectory of the center of mass will be. The importance of a takeoff speed is a factor in the success of sprinters in this event.\n\nThe length of the approach is usually consistent distance for an athlete. Approaches can vary between 12 and 19 strides on the novice and intermediate levels, while at the elite level they are closer to between 20 and 22 strides. The exact distance and number of strides in an approach depends on the jumper's experience, sprinting technique, and conditioning level. Consistency in the approach is important as it is the competitor's objective to get as close to the front of the takeoff board as possible without crossing the line with any part of the foot.\n\nInconsistent approaches are a common problem in the event. As a result, the approach is usually practiced by athletes about 6\u20138 times per jumping session (see [[Long Jump#Training|Training]] below).\n\n===The last two strides===\nThe objective of the last two strides is to prepare the body for takeoff while conserving as much speed as possible.\n\nThe penultimate stride is longer than the last stride. The competitor begins to lower his or her center of gravity to prepare the body for the vertical impulse. The final stride is shorter because the body is beginning to raise the center of gravity in preparation for takeoff.\n\nThe last two strides are extremely important because they determine the velocity with which the competitor will enter the jump.\n\n===Takeoff===\n[[File:Long jump takeoff board.jpg|thumb|right|Takeoff board]]\nThe objective of the takeoff is to create a vertical impulse through the athlete's center of gravity while maintaining balance and control.\n\nThis phase is one of the most technical parts of the long jump. Jumpers must be conscious to place the foot flat on the ground, because jumping off either the heels or the toes negatively affects the jump. Taking off from the board heel-first has a braking effect, which decreases velocity and strains the joints. Jumping off the toes decreases stability, putting the leg at risk of buckling or collapsing from underneath the jumper. While concentrating on foot placement, the athlete must also work to maintain proper body position, keeping the torso upright and moving the hips forward and up to achieve the maximum distance from board contact to foot release.\n\nThere are four main styles of takeoff: the kick style, double-arm style, sprint takeoff, and the power sprint or bounding takeoff.\n\n====Kick====\nThe kick style takeoff is where the athlete actively cycles the leg before a full impulse has been directed into the board then landing into the pit. This requires great strength in the hamstrings. This causes the jumper to jump to large distances.\n\n====Double-arm====\nThe double-arm style of takeoff works by moving both arms in a vertical direction as the competitor takes off. This produces a high hip height and a large vertical impulse.\n\n====Sprint====\nThe sprint takeoff is the style most widely instructed by coaching staff. This is a classic single-arm action that resembles a jumper in full stride. It is an efficient takeoff style for maintaining velocity through takeoff.\n\n====Power sprint or bounding====\nThe power sprint takeoff, or bounding takeoff, is one of the more common elite styles. Very similar to the sprint style, the body resembles a sprinter in full stride. However, there is one major difference. The arm that pushes back on takeoff (the arm on the side of the takeoff leg) fully extends backward, rather than remaining at a bent position. This additional extension increases the impulse at takeoff.\n\nThe \"correct\" style of takeoff will vary from athlete to athlete.\n[[File:Jessica Ennis - long jump - 3.jpg|right|thumb|[[Heptathlon|Multi-eventer]] [[Jessica Ennis]] during a long jump, preparing to land]]\n\n===Action in the air and landing===\nThere are three major flight techniques for the long jump: the hang, the sail, and the hitch-kick. Each technique is to combat the forward rotation experienced from take-off but is basically down to preference from the athlete. It is important to note that once the body is airborne, there is nothing that the athlete can do to change the direction they are traveling and consequently where they are going to land in the pit. However, it can be argued that certain techniques influence an athlete's landing, which can affect the distance measured. For example, if an athlete lands feet first but falls back because they are not correctly balanced, a lower distance will be measured.\n\nIn the 1970s some jumpers used a forward somersault, including [[Tuariki Delamere]] who used it at the 1974 [[NCAA]] Championships, and who matched the jump of the current Olympic champion [[Randy Williams]]. The somersault jump has potential to produce longer jumps than other techniques because in the flip, no power is lost countering forward momentum, and it reduces wind resistance in the air.<ref>{{cite web |title=The Flip That Led To A Flap |author=Ron Reid |date=29 July 1974 |work=Sports Illustrated |url=https://www.si.com/vault/1974/07/29/616167/the-flip-that-led-to-a-flap |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203190409/http://si.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1088829/index.htm |archivedate=3 February 2014}}</ref> The front flip jump was subsequently banned due to fear of it being unsafe.\n\n==Training==\nThe long jump generally requires training in a variety of areas. These areas include: speed work, jumping, over distance running, weight training, plyometric training.\n\n===Speed work===\nSpeed work is essentially short distance speed training where the athlete would be running at top or near top speeds. The distances for this type of work would vary between indoor and outdoor season but are usually around 30\u201360 m for indoors and up to 100 m for outdoors.\n\n===Jumping===\nLong Jumpers tend to practice jumping 1\u20132 times a week. Approaches, or run-throughs, are repeated sometimes up to 6\u20138 times per session.\nShort approach jumps are common for jumpers to do, as it allows for them to work on specific technical aspects of their jumps in a controlled environment. Using equipment such as low hurdles and other obstacles are common in long jump training, as it helps the jumper maintain and hold phases of their jump. As a common rule, it is important for the jumper to engage in full approach jumps at least once a week, as it will prepare the jumper for competition.\n\n===Over-distance running===\nOver-distance running workouts helps the athlete jump a further distance than their set goal. For example, having a 100 m runner practice by running 200 m repeats on a track. This is specifically concentrated in the season when athletes are working on building [[endurance]]. Specific over-distance running workouts are performed 1\u20132 times a week. This is great for building sprint endurance, which is required in competitions where the athlete is sprinting down the runway 3\u20136 times. Typical workouts would include 5\u00d7150 m. Preseason workouts may be longer, including workouts like 6\u00d7300 m.\n\n===Weight training===\nDuring pre-season training and early in the competition season weight training tends to play a major role in the sport. It is customary for a long jumper to weight train up to 4 times a week, focusing mainly on quick movements involving the legs and trunk. Some athletes perform Olympic lifts in training. Athletes use low repetition and emphasize speed to maximize the strength increase while minimizing adding additional weight to their frame. Important lifts for a long jumper include the back squat, front squat, power cleans and hang cleans. The emphasis on these lifts should be on speed and explosive as those are crucial in the long jump take off phase.\n\n===Plyometrics===\n[[Plyometrics]], including running up and down stairs and hurdle bounding, can be incorporated into workouts, generally twice a week. This allows an athlete to work on agility and explosiveness. Other plyometric workouts that are common for long jumpers are box jumps. Boxes of various heights are set up spaced evenly apart and jumpers can proceed jumping onto them and off moving in a forward direction. They can vary the jumps from both legs to single jumps. Alternatively, they can set up the boxes in front of a high jump mat if allowed, and jump over a high jump bar onto the mat mimicking a landing phase of the jump. These plyometric workouts are typically performed at the end of a workout.\n\n===Bounding===\nBounding is any sort of continuous jumping or leaping. Bounding drills usually require single leg bounding, double-leg bounding, or some variation of the two. <!-- (commented out because this is not bounding, it is a different type of plyometrics) It can also include box drills or depth jumps.--> The focus of bounding drills is usually to spend as little time on the ground as possible and working on technical accuracy, fluidity, and jumping endurance and strength. Technically, bounding is part of plyometrics, as a form of a running exercise such as high knees and butt kicks.\n\n===Flexibility===\n[[Flexibility (anatomy)|Flexibility]] is an often forgotten{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} tool for long jumpers. Effective flexibility prevents injury, which can be important for high-impact events such as the long jump. It also helps the athlete sprint down the runway.\nHip and groin injuries are common for long jumpers who may neglect proper warm-up and stretching.\n\nHurdle mobility drills are a common way that jumpers improve flexibility. Common hurdle drills include setting up about 5\u20137 hurdles at appropriate heights and having athletes walk over them in a continuous fashion. Other variations of hurdle mobility drills are used as well, including hurdle skips.\nThis is a crucial part of a jumper's training since they perform most exercises for a very short period of time and often aren't aware of their form and technique.\nA common tool in many long jump workouts is the use of [[Video tape recording|video taping]]. This enables the athlete to go back and watch their own progress as well as letting the athlete compare their own footage to that of some of the world-class jumpers.\n\nTraining styles, duration, and intensity vary immensely from athlete to athlete and are based on the experience and strength of the athlete as well as on their coaching style.\n\n== Culture ==\n[[File:2003 Greece 10 Euro OS Long Jump front.jpg|thumb|[[Euro gold and silver commemorative coins (Greece)#2003 coinage|Long Jump commemorative coin]]]]\n\nTrack and field events have been selected as a main motif in numerous collectors' coins. One of the recent samples is the \u20ac10 Greek [[Euro gold and silver commemorative coins (Greece)#2003 coinage|Long Jump commemorative coin]], minted in 2003 to commemorate the [[2004 Summer Olympics]]. The obverse of the coin portrays a modern athlete at the moment he is touching the ground, while the ancient athlete in the background is shown while starting off his jump, as he is seen on a black-figure vase of the 5th century BC.\n\n==Records==\n[[File:50 a\u00f1os de M\u00e9xico 68 - 16.jpg|thumb|Sand pit where Bob Beamon set the 8.90 m record in Mexico City, Mexico.]]\nThe men's long jump world record has been held by just four individuals for the majority of time since the [[IAAF]] started to ratify records.  The first mark recognized by the [[IAAF]] in 1912, the 1901 performance by [[Peter O'Connor (athlete)|Peter O'Connor]], stood just short of 20 years (nine years as an IAAF record). After it was broken in 1921, the record changed hands six times until [[Jesse Owens]] set the record at the 1935 [[Big Ten Conference|Big Ten]] track meet in Ann Arbor, Michigan, of {{T&Fcalc|8.13}} that was not broken for 25 years and 2 months, until 1960, by [[Ralph Boston]]. Boston improved upon it and exchanged records with [[Igor Ter-Ovanesyan]] seven times over the next seven years.  At the [[1968 Summer Olympics]] [[Bob Beamon]] jumped {{convert|8.90|m|ftin|2|abbr=on}}, a jump not exceeded for 23 years, and which remains the second longest legal jump of all time; yet it has stood as the Olympic record for {{years ago|1968}} years. On 30 August 1991 [[Mike Powell (athlete)|Mike Powell]] of the United States set the current men's world record at the [[1991 World Championships in Athletics|World Championships]] in Tokyo.  It was in a [[1991 World Championships in Athletics \u2013 Men's long jump|dramatic showdown]] against [[Carl Lewis]], who also surpassed Beamon's record that day but with an aiding wind (thus not legal for record purposes).  Powell's record {{convert|8.95|m|ftin|2|abbr=on}} has now stood for over {{years ago|1991|08|30}} years.\n\nSome jumps over {{T&Fcalc|8.95}} have been officially recorded. {{T&Fcalc|8.99}} was recorded by Powell (wind-aided +4.4) set at high altitude in [[Sestriere]], Italy, in 1992.

This jump remains the longest ever not to win an Olympic or World Championship gold medal, or any competition in general.\n\nThe women's world record has seen more consistent improvement, though the current record has stood longer than any long jump record by men or women.  The longest to hold the record prior was by [[Fanny Blankers-Koen]] during [[World War II]]. who held it for 10 years.  There have been three occasions where the record was tied or improved upon twice in the same competition. The current world record for women is held by [[Galina Chistyakova]] of the former Soviet Union who leapt {{convert|7.52|m|ftin|2|abbr=on}} in [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]] on 11 June 1988, a mark that has stood for over {{years ago|1988|06|11}} years.\n\n==All-time top 25 long jumpers==\n{{see also|Men's long jump world record progression|Women's long jump world record progression}}\n\n===Men===\n* {{As of|2020|02|01}}.<ref name=AlltimeMO>[http://www.iaaf.org/records/toplists/jumps/long-jump/outdoor/men/senior Long Jump \u2013 men \u2013 senior \u2013 outdoor].

By 1554, the cash deficit for the year was calculated to be over 4.3&nbsp;million ducats, even after all tax receipts for the six ensuing years had been pledged and the proceeds spent in advance. Credit at this point began costing the crown 43 percent interest (largely financed by the [[Fugger]] and [[Welser]] banking families). By 1557 the crown was refusing payment from the Indies since even this was required for payment of the war effort (used in the offensive and Spanish victory at the battle of St. Quentin in August 1557).<ref>{{Cite book |last=Lynch |first=John |title=Spain Under the Habsburgs |publisher=New York University Press |year=1984 |isbn=0-8147-5010-9 |edition=2nd |location=New York |pages=62\u201363}}</ref>\n\nFrench finances during the war were mainly financed by the increase in the [[taille]] tax, as well as indirect taxes like the [[Gabelle of salt|gabelle]] and customs fees.

The [[Duchy of Milan]] and the [[Habsburg Netherlands]] were left in personal union to the King of Spain while continuing to be part of the Holy Roman Empire. With the end of the personal union of the Holy Roman Empire and Spain (\"Habsburg encirclement\"), France was open to peace talks. A truce was reached in Vaucelles around 1556, but it was broken shortly after. The condition of economic and religious turmoil in which the war resumed forced the parties to make peace in 1559.<ref>{{Cite book |last=Knecht |first=Robert Jean |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Catherine_De_Medici.html?id=qAojAQAAIAAJ |title=Catherine De' Medici |date=1998 |publisher=Longman |isbn=978-0-582-08242-7 |pages=54 |author-link=Robert Knecht}}</ref> \n\nBy the terms of the treaties, France ended military operations in the [[Spanish Netherlands]] and the [[Kingdom of Italy (Holy Roman Empire)#Imperial fiefs|Imperial fiefs of northern Italy]] bringing an end to most of the French occupation in Corsica, Tuscany and Piedmont. England and the Habsburgs, in exchange, ended their opposition to French occupation of the [[Pale of Calais]], the [[Three Bishoprics]], and a number of fortresses. For [[Spain]], despite no new gains and the restoration of some occupied territories to France, the peace was a positive result as it confirmed its control of the [[Habsburg Netherlands]], the [[Duchy of Milan]], and southern Italy (Sardinia, Naples, Sicily). [[Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor|Ferdinand I]] left the Three Bishoprics under French occupation, but the Netherlands and most of northern Italy remained part of the Holy Roman Empire in the form of imperial fiefs. Furthermore, his position of Holy Roman Emperor was recognized by the Pope who had refused to do so as long as the war between France and the Habsburgs continued. England fared poorly during the war, and the loss of its last stronghold on the continent damaged its reputation.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.tudorsociety.com/an-overview-of-the-results-of-the-treaty-of-cateau-cambresis-1569/ |title=An Overview of the Results of the Treaty of Cateau-Cambr\u00e9sis 1559 |last=Ridgway |first=Claire |date=2017-04-03 |website=The Tudor Society |df=dmy-all |access-date=2020-04-01}}</ref>\n\nAt the end of the conflict, Italy was therefore divided between [[viceroyalties]] of the Spanish Habsburgs in the south and [[Kingdom of Italy (Holy Roman Empire)|formal fiefs]] of the Austrian Habsburgs in the north. The imperial states were ruled by the [[Doria family|Doria]] in Genoa, the [[House of Medici|Medici]] in Tuscany, the Spanish Habsburgs in Milan, the [[House of Farnese|Farnese]] in Parma, the [[House of Este|Estensi]] in Modena, and an ''Italianized'' [[House of Savoy]] in Piedmont. The southern Kingdoms of Naples, Sicily and Sardinia were under direct rule of the Spanish Habsburgs.

The main ideologue of modern Religious Zionism was Rabbi [[Abraham Isaac Kook]], who justified Zionism according to [[Halakha|Jewish law]], and urged young religious Jews to support efforts to settle the land, and the secular [[Labour Zionist]]s to give more consideration to Judaism. Kook saw Zionism as a part of a divine scheme which would result in the resettlement of the Jewish people in its homeland. This would bring salvation (\"Geula\") to Jews, and then to the entire world. After world harmony is achieved by the refoundation of the Jewish homeland, the [[Messiah]] will come. Although this has not yet happened, Kook emphasized that it would take time, and that the ultimate redemption happens in stages, often not apparent while happening. In 1924, when Kook became the [[Ashkenazi]] [[Chief Rabbi]] of [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], he tried to reconcile Zionism with [[Orthodox Judaism]].\n\n== Ideology ==\n[[File:Jerusalem Day.jpg|thumb|Religious Zionists celebrating [[Jerusalem Day]]]]\nReligious Zionists believe that \"[[Eretz Israel|Eretz Yisrael]]\" (the Land of Israel) was promised to the ancient [[Israelites]] by [[God in Judaism|God]].  Furthermore, modern Jews have the obligation to possess and defend the land in ways that comport with the [[Torah]]'s high standards of justice.<ref>Novak, David.  [https://mosaicmagazine.com/response/politics-current-affairs/2020/01/what-unites-people-of-faith-across-religions-and-divides-them-from-others/ \"What Unites People of Faith across Religions, and Divides Them from Others.\"] ''Mosaic''.  23 January 2020.  23 January 2020.</ref> To generations of [[Jewish diaspora|diaspora Jews]], [[Jerusalem]] has been a symbol of the [[Holy Land]] and of their return to it, as promised by God in numerous [[Bible|Biblical prophecies]]. Despite this, many Jews did not embrace Zionism before the 1930s, and certain religious groups opposed it then, as some groups still do now, on the grounds that an attempt to re-establish Jewish rule in Israel by [[human agency]] was blasphemous. Hastening salvation and the coming of the Messiah was considered religiously forbidden, and Zionism was seen as a sign of disbelief in God's power, and therefore, a rebellion against God. Rabbi Kook developed a [[theology|theological]] answer to that claim, which gave Zionism a religious legitimation: \"Zionism was not merely a political movement by secular Jews. It was actually a tool of [[God]] to promote His divine scheme, and to initiate the return of the Jews to their homeland \u2013 the land He promised to [[Abraham]], [[Isaac]], and [[Jacob]]. God wants the [[children of Israel]] to return to their home in order to establish a Jewish sovereign state in which Jews could live according to the laws of [[Torah]] and [[Halakha]], and commit the [[Mitzvah|Mitzvot]] of Eretz Israel (these are religious commandments which can be performed only in the [[Land of Israel]]). Moreover, to cultivate the Land of Israel was a Mitzvah by itself, and it should be carried out. Therefore, settling [[Eretz Israel|Israel]] is an obligation of the religious Jews, and helping Zionism is actually following God's will.\"<ref>{{cite book |title=Torat Eretz Yisrael|first=David|last=Samson|author2=Tzvi Fishman |publisher=Torat Eretz Yisrael Publications|location=Jerusalem |year=1991}}</ref>\n\nReligious Jews also disapproved of the Zionists because many were secular Jews or [[atheist]]s, taking their cue from [[Marxism]]. [[Labour Zionism|Socialist Zionism]] envisaged the movement as a tool for building an advanced [[socialist]] society in the land of Israel, while solving the problem of [[antisemitism]]. The early [[kibbutz]] was a communal settlement that focused on national goals, unencumbered by religion and precepts of Jewish law such as [[kashrut]]. Socialist Zionists were one of the results of a long process of modernization within the Jewish communities of Europe, known as the [[Haskalah]], or Jewish Enlightenment. Rabbi Kook's answer was as follows:\n\n:''Secular Zionists may think they do it for political, national, or socialist reasons, but in fact \u2013 the actual reason for them coming to resettle in [[Eretz Israel|Israel]] is a religious Jewish spark (\"Nitzotz\") in their [[soul]], planted by God. Without their knowledge, they are contributing to the divine scheme and actually committing a great [[Mitzvah]].''\n\n:''The role of religious Zionists is to help them to establish a Jewish state and turn the religious spark in them into a great light. They should show them that the real source of Zionism and the longed-for Zion is [[Judaism]] and teach them [[Torah]] with love and kindness. In the end, they will understand that the laws of [[Torah]] are the key to true [[harmony]] and a [[socialist]] state (not in the [[Marxist]] [[Socialist mode of production|meaning]]) that will be a light for the [[goyim|nations]] and bring salvation to the world.''\n\n[[Shlomo Avineri]] explained the last part of Kook's answer: \"... and the end of those pioneers, who scout into the blindness of secularism and atheism, but the treasured light inside them leads them into the path of salvation \u2013 their end is that from doing Mitzva without purpose, they will do Mitzva with a purpose.\" (page 222, <sup>[[Religious Zionist Movement#References|1]]</sup>)\n\n== Organizations ==\n[[File:Bnei akiva logo.jpg|thumb|100px|left|[[Bnei Akiva]] youth movement, combining Torah and work]]\n\nThe first rabbis to support Zionism were [[Judah Alkalai|Yehuda Shlomo Alkalai]] and [[Zvi Hirsch Kalischer]]. They argued that the change in the status of [[Western Europe]]'s Jews following [[Jewish emancipation|emancipation]] was the first step toward redemption (\u05d2\u05d0\u05d5\u05dc\u05d4), and that, therefore, one must hasten the messianic salvation by a natural salvation \u2013 whose main pillars are the [[Kibbutz Galuyot]] (\"Gathering of the Exiles\"), the return to Eretz Israel, agricultural work (\u05e2\u05d1\u05d5\u05d3\u05ea \u05d0\u05d3\u05de\u05d4), and the revival of the everyday use of the [[Hebrew language]].\n\nThe [[Mizrachi (Religious Zionism)|Mizrachi]] organization was established in 1902 in [[Vilna]] at a world conference of Religious Zionists. It operates a [[Zionist youth movement|youth movement]], [[Bnei Akiva]], which was founded in 1929. Mizrachi believes that the [[Torah]] should be at the centre of [[Zionism]], a sentiment expressed in the Mizrachi Zionist slogan ''Am Yisrael B'Eretz Yisrael al pi Torat Yisrael'' (\"The people of Israel in the land of Israel according to the Torah of Israel\"). It also sees Jewish nationalism as a tool for achieving religious objectives. Mizrachi was the first official Religious Zionist party. It also built a network of religious schools that exist to this day.\n\nIn 1937-1948, the [[Religious Kibbutz Movement]] established three settlement blocs of three kibbutzim each. The first was in the [[Beit Shean]] Valley, the second was in the [[Hebron]] mountains south of [[Bethlehem]] (known as [[Gush Etzion]]), and the third was in the western [[Negev]]. Kibbutz [[Yavne]] was founded in the center of the country as the core of a fourth bloc that came into being after the establishment of the state.<ref>\"Settlement clustering on a socio-cultural basis: The bloc settlement policy of the Religious Kibbutz Movement in Palestine,\" Yossi Katz, ''Journal of Rural Studies'', vol. 11, no. 2, pp. 161\u2013171, 1995</ref>\n\n== Political parties ==\nThe [[Labor Movement]] wing of Religious Zionism, founded in 1921 under the Zionist slogan \"Torah va'Avodah\" (Torah and Labor), was called [[Hapoel HaMizrachi]]. It represented religiously traditional [[Labour Zionism|Labour Zionists]], both in Europe and in the Land of Israel, where it represented religious Jews in the [[Histadrut]]. In 1956, Mizrachi, Hapoel HaMizrachi, and other religious Zionists formed the [[National Religious Party]] to advance the rights of religious Zionist Jews in Israel.

The main ideologue of modern Religious Zionism was Rabbi [[Abraham Isaac Kook]], who justified Zionism according to [[Halakha|Jewish law]], and urged young religious Jews to support efforts to settle the land, and the secular [[Labour Zionist]]s to give more consideration to Judaism. Kook saw Zionism as a part of a divine scheme which would result in the resettlement of the Jewish people in its homeland. This would bring salvation (\"Geula\") to Jews, and then to the entire world. After world harmony is achieved by the refoundation of the Jewish homeland, the [[Messiah]] will come. Although this has not yet happened, Kook emphasized that it would take time, and that the ultimate redemption happens in stages, often not apparent while happening. In 1924, when Kook became the [[Ashkenazi]] [[Chief Rabbi]] of [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], he tried to reconcile Zionism with [[Orthodox Judaism]].\n\n== Ideology ==\n[[File:Jerusalem Day.jpg|thumb|Religious Zionists celebrating [[Jerusalem Day]]]]\nReligious Zionists believe that \"[[Eretz Israel|Eretz Yisrael]]\" (the Land of Israel) was promised to the ancient [[Israelites]] by [[God in Judaism|God]].  Furthermore, modern Jews have the obligation to possess and defend the land in ways that comport with the [[Torah]]'s high standards of justice.<ref>Novak, David.  [https://mosaicmagazine.com/response/politics-current-affairs/2020/01/what-unites-people-of-faith-across-religions-and-divides-them-from-others/ \"What Unites People of Faith across Religions, and Divides Them from Others.\"] ''Mosaic''.  23 January 2020.  23 January 2020.</ref> To generations of [[Jewish diaspora|diaspora Jews]], [[Jerusalem]] has been a symbol of the [[Holy Land]] and of their return to it, as promised by God in numerous [[Bible|Biblical prophecies]]. Despite this, many Jews did not embrace Zionism before the 1930s, and certain religious groups opposed it then, as some groups still do now, on the grounds that an attempt to re-establish Jewish rule in Israel by [[human agency]] was blasphemous. Hastening salvation and the coming of the Messiah was considered religiously forbidden, and Zionism was seen as a sign of disbelief in God's power, and therefore, a rebellion against God. Rabbi Kook developed a [[theology|theological]] answer to that claim, which gave Zionism a religious legitimation: \"Zionism was not merely a political movement by secular Jews. It was actually a tool of [[God]] to promote His divine scheme, and to initiate the return of the Jews to their homeland \u2013 the land He promised to [[Abraham]], [[Isaac]], and [[Jacob]]. God wants the [[children of Israel]] to return to their home in order to establish a Jewish sovereign state in which Jews could live according to the laws of [[Torah]] and [[Halakha]], and commit the [[Mitzvah|Mitzvot]] of Eretz Israel (these are religious commandments which can be performed only in the [[Land of Israel]]). Moreover, to cultivate the Land of Israel was a Mitzvah by itself, and it should be carried out. Therefore, settling [[Eretz Israel|Israel]] is an obligation of the religious Jews, and helping Zionism is actually following God's will.\"<ref>{{cite book |title=Torat Eretz Yisrael|first=David|last=Samson|author2=Tzvi Fishman |publisher=Torat Eretz Yisrael Publications|location=Jerusalem |year=1991}}</ref>\n\nReligious Jews also disapproved of the Zionists because many were secular Jews or [[atheist]]s, taking their cue from [[Marxism]]. [[Labour Zionism|Socialist Zionism]] envisaged the movement as a tool for building an advanced [[socialist]] society in the land of Israel, while solving the problem of [[antisemitism]]. The early [[kibbutz]] was a communal settlement that focused on national goals, unencumbered by religion and precepts of Jewish law such as [[kashrut]]. Socialist Zionists were one of the results of a long process of modernization within the Jewish communities of Europe, known as the [[Haskalah]], or Jewish Enlightenment. Rabbi Kook's answer was as follows:\n\n:''Secular Zionists may think they do it for political, national, or socialist reasons, but in fact \u2013 the actual reason for them coming to resettle in [[Eretz Israel|Israel]] is a religious Jewish spark (\"Nitzotz\") in their [[soul]], planted by God. Without their knowledge, they are contributing to the divine scheme and actually committing a great [[Mitzvah]].''\n\n:''The role of religious Zionists is to help them to establish a Jewish state and turn the religious spark in them into a great light. They should show them that the real source of Zionism and the longed-for Zion is [[Judaism]] and teach them [[Torah]] with love and kindness. In the end, they will understand that the laws of [[Torah]] are the key to true [[harmony]] and a [[socialist]] state (not in the [[Marxist]] [[Socialist mode of production|meaning]]) that will be a light for the [[goyim|nations]] and bring salvation to the world.''\n\n[[Shlomo Avineri]] explained the last part of Kook's answer: \"... and the end of those pioneers, who scout into the blindness of secularism and atheism, but the treasured light inside them leads them into the path of salvation \u2013 their end is that from doing Mitzva without purpose, they will do Mitzva with a purpose.\" (page 222, <sup>[[Religious Zionist Movement#References|1]]</sup>)\n\n== Organizations ==\n[[File:Bnei akiva logo.jpg|thumb|100px|left|[[Bnei Akiva]] youth movement, combining Torah and work]]\n\nThe first rabbis to support Zionism were [[Judah Alkalai|Yehuda Shlomo Alkalai]] and [[Zvi Hirsch Kalischer]]. They argued that the change in the status of [[Western Europe]]'s Jews following [[Jewish emancipation|emancipation]] was the first step toward redemption (\u05d2\u05d0\u05d5\u05dc\u05d4), and that, therefore, one must hasten the messianic salvation by a natural salvation \u2013 whose main pillars are the [[Kibbutz Galuyot]] (\"Gathering of the Exiles\"), the return to Eretz Israel, agricultural work (\u05e2\u05d1\u05d5\u05d3\u05ea \u05d0\u05d3\u05de\u05d4), and the revival of the everyday use of the [[Hebrew language]].\n\nThe [[Mizrachi (Religious Zionism)|Mizrachi]] organization was established in 1902 in [[Vilna]] at a world conference of Religious Zionists. It operates a [[Zionist youth movement|youth movement]], [[Bnei Akiva]], which was founded in 1929. Mizrachi believes that the [[Torah]] should be at the centre of [[Zionism]], a sentiment expressed in the Mizrachi Zionist slogan ''Am Yisrael B'Eretz Yisrael al pi Torat Yisrael'' (\"The people of Israel in the land of Israel according to the Torah of Israel\"). It also sees Jewish nationalism as a tool for achieving religious objectives. Mizrachi was the first official Religious Zionist party. It also built a network of religious schools that exist to this day.\n\nIn 1937-1948, the [[Religious Kibbutz Movement]] established three settlement blocs of three kibbutzim each. The first was in the [[Beit Shean]] Valley, the second was in the [[Hebron]] mountains south of [[Bethlehem]] (known as [[Gush Etzion]]), and the third was in the western [[Negev]]. Kibbutz [[Yavne]] was founded in the center of the country as the core of a fourth bloc that came into being after the establishment of the state.<ref>\"Settlement clustering on a socio-cultural basis: The bloc settlement policy of the Religious Kibbutz Movement in Palestine,\" Yossi Katz, ''Journal of Rural Studies'', vol. 11, no. 2, pp. 161\u2013171, 1995</ref>\n\n== Political parties ==\nThe [[Labor Movement]] wing of Religious Zionism, founded in 1921 under the Zionist slogan \"Torah va'Avodah\" (Torah and Labor), was called [[Hapoel HaMizrachi]]. It represented religiously traditional [[Labour Zionism|Labour Zionists]], both in Europe and in the Land of Israel, where it represented religious Jews in the [[Histadrut]]. In 1956, Mizrachi, Hapoel HaMizrachi, and other religious Zionists formed the [[National Religious Party]] to advance the rights of religious Zionist Jews in Israel. Other parties and groups affiliated with religious Zionism are [[Gush Emunim]], [[Tkuma (political party)|Tkuma]], and [[Meimad]]. [[Kahanism]], a radical branch of religious Zionism, was founded by Rabbi [[Meir Kahane]], whose party, [[Kach and Kahane Chai|Kach]], was eventually banned for [[racism]].

The resultant design was to become the G14 Class.<ref name=Bradley />{{page needed|date=October 2016}}\n\n== Construction history ==\n\nDrummond decided to continue his development of the 4-6-0 wheel arrangement in anticipation of further increases in speed and length of trains, a concept that had many advantages that would be incorporated onto his third design of this type.  A 175&nbsp;lbf/in\u00b2 saturated boiler, somewhat smaller than on the F13/E14 classes  was utilised to power the four-cylinder front end.<ref name=Bradley />{{page needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nThe new design was equipped with inside and outside sets of [[Walschaerts valve gear]], therefore reducing the mechanical complexity that had plagued his previous designs, and these powered 6' wheels.<ref name=Swift-460>Swift, Peter W. ''Railway Archive'' '''6''': pp. 3\u201324.</ref>  This factor also meant a slightly lighter axle-loading, compared to the mixed Stephenson/Walschaerts [[LSWR F13 class|F13 class]].  Large, single splashers were also implemented which covered the wheels, though these would prove troublesome in service.

The LSWR's immediate traffic needs could not be covered by the relatively unsuccessful [[LSWR E14 class|E14 class]] design of 1907 and the first Drummond 4-6-0, the [[LSWR F13 class|F13 class]] of 1905 had been withdrawn from the heavy passenger services they were designed to undertake, as they would not 'run' and were heavy on coal, water and man-hours in terms of upkeep.<ref name=Bradley />{{page needed|date=October 2016}}  However, the problem of continually accelerating timetables to the South Coast ports remained, and any further engines of the E14 class could not be relied upon to uphold the heavy passenger services alone.<ref name=Bradley />{{page needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nIt was once again clear that another 4-6-0 design was needed due to bolster the strength of heavy express passenger locomotives available to the LSWR's operating department.<ref name=Bradley />{{page needed|date=October 2016}}  Their proven ability to ply their trade at faster speeds, and their inherently better power-to-weight ratio on other lines meant that Drummond decided to persevere with the concept.<ref name=Bradley />{{page needed|date=October 2016}}  He also retained the four-cylinder layout.  The resultant design was to become the G14 Class.<ref name=Bradley />{{page needed|date=October 2016}}\n\n== Construction history ==\n\nDrummond decided to continue his development of the 4-6-0 wheel arrangement in anticipation of further increases in speed and length of trains, a concept that had many advantages that would be incorporated onto his third design of this type.  A 175&nbsp;lbf/in\u00b2 saturated boiler, somewhat smaller than on the F13/E14 classes  was utilised to power the four-cylinder front end.<ref name=Bradley />{{page needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nThe new design was equipped with inside and outside sets of [[Walschaerts valve gear]], therefore reducing the mechanical complexity that had plagued his previous designs, and these powered 6' wheels.<ref name=Swift-460>Swift, Peter W. ''Railway Archive'' '''6''': pp. 3\u201324.</ref>  This factor also meant a slightly lighter axle-loading, compared to the mixed Stephenson/Walschaerts [[LSWR F13 class|F13 class]].  Large, single splashers were also implemented which covered the wheels, though these would prove troublesome in service.  The Drummond 'watercart' eight-wheeled tender was utilised for the long journeys on the LSWR mainline.  Full-scale construction was undertaken at [[Nine Elms]], with the first of five G14s being outshopped in 1908.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Year!!Order!!Quantity!!LSWR numbers!!Notes\n|-\n|1908||<center>G14</center>||<center>5</center>||453\u2013457|| \n|-\n|}\n\n===Rebuilding under Maunsell===\n\nAfter a period of 17 years in both primary and secondary passenger duties, [[Richard Maunsell]], who became [[Chief Mechanical Engineer]] of the newly formed [[Southern Railway (UK)|Southern Railway]] in 1923, decided that as the class did not to conform with the general standardization of Southern locomotive classes it should be withdrawn.<ref name=Bradley />{{page needed|date=October 2016}}  The G14s were reduced to kits of parts, some of which may have been utilised in creating a further batch of [[LSWR N15 class|N15 (King Arthur Class)]] locomotives.<ref name=Haresnape>Haresnape (1977)</ref>{{page needed|date=October 2016}}\n\n== Livery and numbering ==\n\nUnder the LSWR, the G14s were outshopped in the LSWR Passenger Royal Green livery with purple-brown edging, creating panels of green.<ref name=Bradley />{{page needed|date=October 2016}} This was further lined in white and black with 'LSWR' in gilt on the tender tank sides.\n\nWhen transferred to [[Southern Railway (UK)|Southern Railway]] ownership after 1923, the locomotives were outshopped in Richard Maunsell's darker version of the LSWR livery.<ref name=Swift-N15>Swift, Peter (2006).

As an independent coeducational institution, it offers education to students of all nationalities, ranging from [[preschool]], students aged from 3 years, to [[high school]] grade 12 of the type K-12. It offers the [[International Baccalaureate]] and the Lebanese Baccalaureate programs as well as its own [[college prep]] program.\n\n== History ==\nThe school was founded by a small group of American parents from the [[American University of Beirut]], then known as the Syrian Protestant College, who wanted a school where their children could receive preparation for entrance into American universities. The small faculty school thrived and by 1920 had expanded from its original home on rue Bliss to a red-roofed house on rue Sidani. At this point, the [[American Presbyterian Mission]] joined the AUB in sponsorship of the school. It was at this point that the school was renamed to the American Community School. By the 1940s, the student body had grown to more than 900 primarily [[Western culture|Western]] children; the present building was built in 1949 with funds provided by [[ARAMCO]]. Today, students are primarily Lebanese, as with the university.\n\nThe school celebrated its Centennial on June 24, 2005, and in June 2011, ACS Beirut celebrated the graduation of its 100th graduating class.  Dr. George H. Damon, Jr. remained Headmaster of the school from 2003 till his retirement in 2013.<ref>{{cite web | title = Special dinner held recognizing Dr. George H.

The American High School Diploma program prepares students for admission to colleges and universities in the US. All graduates will earn the high school diploma. Additionally, ACS offers the International Baccalaureate diploma as well as the Lebanese Baccalaureate diploma. Each of these three diploma programs has a slightly different course of study, but only in selected grade levels. For the IB Diploma Program, the course of study is differentiated in the last two years of high school. For the Lebanese Baccalaureate, the course of study differs in grades 9 and 12. Otherwise, regardless of their diploma program, students are all exposed to an American curriculum characterized by the study of values that include openness, democracy, and creativity, as well as respect for all religions and gender equity.\n\n== Campus Facilities ==\n\nThe ACS campus is located within a short distance from the Mediterranean Sea and consists of five buildings.\n\nThe Lower School building consists of a library, computer center, auditorium, multipurpose hall, art room, as well as the Early Years and Elementary administrative wing. The Middle School building houses all Middle School classrooms, science laboratories, lego robotics lab, High School student services, counselors, infirmary, special support personnel, college counselor, and community service advisor, as well as the Upper Library and the Middle School computer center. The building has its own auditorium and music room and houses the School Cafeteria. The Upper School Building, also known as BD Building, consists of a bookstore, Community Lounge, Print Shop, IT Department, High School classrooms, and laboratories, as well as administrative offices. The gymnasium, built in the late 1950s, stood as an architectural landmark for decades and includes a basketball court, locker rooms, a dance studio, and a fitness center.  The faculty building was completed in April 2015. The first basement and ground floor host music rooms for elementary, middle, and high school divisions. Elementary language rooms and Grade 5 classrooms are located on first through the third floor. The residential part consists of 16 typical apartments starting on the 4th up to the 11th. The Head of School residence is located on the 12th and 13th floor with a rooftop that is used for social gatherings, as well as collecting solar energy to help become environmentally friendly.\n\n== Athletics ==\nACS Beirut is notable for its athletics program. The athletics program partakes in several sporting conferences, including [[CEESA]] and the Oasis Athletics Conference, along with locally held tournaments. The athletics department at ACS Beirut promotes a \"student-athlete\" relationship whereby the academic standing of a student is the prerequisite for a student's athletic standing. For this reason, if any students are in a state of academic probation, they are prohibited from playing sports, and in certain circumstances, prohibited from traveling with their team for international tournaments. \n\nThere are several awards presented to student-athletes at different levels in Middle School and High School. While all team members are presented with participation patches, four outstanding athletes are presented with four awards respectively. These awards, determined by the coach, are the [[Fighting Heart Award]], the Most Improved Player, Perfect Attendance Award, and Coach's Award. In a more holistic approach, there are three awards, the Spirit in Sports Award, Junior Knight Award, and Knight Award. The Spirit in Sports Award is presented to the athlete that displays outstanding school spirit, sportsmanship, and participation. The Junior Knight Award is presented to one male and one female from grades 9 and 10 who demonstrate outstanding dedication, skill, sportsmanship, and leadership. Likewise, the Knight Award is presented to one male and one female who demonstrate the same values described by the Junior Knight Award, however, it is presented to students from grades 11 and 12. Additionally, select seniors are recognized through two awards, The Blair Harcourt Award and the Farah Family Athletics and Leadership Award. The Blair Harcourt Award is presented to the senior with academic distinction, 3.3/4 GPA or higher, as well as athletic distinction, standing in parallel with the values of the Knight Award. The Farah Family Athletics and Leadership Award is presented to the senior who excels in the academic program at ACS Beirut, demonstrates leadership and commitment, and positively impacts the athletic and academic life at ACS Beirut.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.acs.edu.lb/uploaded/2017/ACS_Athlete_Handbook-Singles.pdf|title=ACS Athlete Handbook|last=|first=|date=|website=acs.edu.lb|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nAt the head of the Athletics Department of ACS Beirut is the athletics and activities director.

The Head of School residence is located on the 12th and 13th floor with a rooftop that is used for social gatherings, as well as collecting solar energy to help become environmentally friendly.\n\n== Athletics ==\nACS Beirut is notable for its athletics program. The athletics program partakes in several sporting conferences, including [[CEESA]] and the Oasis Athletics Conference, along with locally held tournaments. The athletics department at ACS Beirut promotes a \"student-athlete\" relationship whereby the academic standing of a student is the prerequisite for a student's athletic standing. For this reason, if any students are in a state of academic probation, they are prohibited from playing sports, and in certain circumstances, prohibited from traveling with their team for international tournaments. \n\nThere are several awards presented to student-athletes at different levels in Middle School and High School. While all team members are presented with participation patches, four outstanding athletes are presented with four awards respectively. These awards, determined by the coach, are the [[Fighting Heart Award]], the Most Improved Player, Perfect Attendance Award, and Coach's Award. In a more holistic approach, there are three awards, the Spirit in Sports Award, Junior Knight Award, and Knight Award. The Spirit in Sports Award is presented to the athlete that displays outstanding school spirit, sportsmanship, and participation. The Junior Knight Award is presented to one male and one female from grades 9 and 10 who demonstrate outstanding dedication, skill, sportsmanship, and leadership. Likewise, the Knight Award is presented to one male and one female who demonstrate the same values described by the Junior Knight Award, however, it is presented to students from grades 11 and 12. Additionally, select seniors are recognized through two awards, The Blair Harcourt Award and the Farah Family Athletics and Leadership Award. The Blair Harcourt Award is presented to the senior with academic distinction, 3.3/4 GPA or higher, as well as athletic distinction, standing in parallel with the values of the Knight Award. The Farah Family Athletics and Leadership Award is presented to the senior who excels in the academic program at ACS Beirut, demonstrates leadership and commitment, and positively impacts the athletic and academic life at ACS Beirut.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.acs.edu.lb/uploaded/2017/ACS_Athlete_Handbook-Singles.pdf|title=ACS Athlete Handbook|last=|first=|date=|website=acs.edu.lb|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nAt the head of the Athletics Department of ACS Beirut is the athletics and activities director.

It is closely related to the [[South Island robin]] (''P. australis''). It was first described by [[Walter Buller]] in 1872. The binomial commemorates the New Zealand botanist [[Henry H. Travers]] (1844\u20131928). Unlike its mainland counterparts, its flight capacity is somewhat reduced. Evolution in the absence of mammalian [[predator]]s made it vulnerable to [[introduced species]], such as cats and rats, and it became extinct on the main island of the Chatham group before 1871, being restricted to [[Little Mangere Island]] thereafter.<ref name=Falla>Falla, R.A.,Sibson, R.B. and Turbott, E.G., illustrated by Elaine Power. (1979) The new guide to the birds of New Zealand and outlying islands. Collins, Auckland.{{pn|date=April 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Discovery and taxonomy==\nThe first mention of the black robin in science was at a presentation given by [[William Travers (politician)|William Travers]] at the Wellington Philosophical Society in 1871. He presented the findings of his son, [[Henry Travers (naturalist)|Henry Travers]], who had visited the Chatham Islands to investigate their fauna. Although Henry Travers' notes on his visit were published the following year, it was the publication of [[Walter Buller]] a month later that is considered the species' official description.<ref>Butler (1992) p. 5</ref>\n\n==Description==\n[[File:Petroica traversi crop.png|thumb|left|Illustration by [[John Gerrard Keulemans]]]] \nThe black robin is a small, [[house sparrow|sparrow]]-sized bird measuring {{convert|10|\u2013|15|cm|in}}. Its plumage is almost entirely brownish-black, with a black bill and brownish-black yellow-soled feet.<ref name=Falla></ref>\n\nFemales are usually slightly smaller than males. Male songs are a simple phrase of 5 to 7 notes. Its call is a high-pitched single note. Their eyes are dark brown. Black robins moult between December and March.\n\n==Habitat==\n[[File:Mangere.jpg|thumb|Mangere Island (left) and Little Mangere Island (right)]]\nBlack robins live in low-altitude scrub forest remnants. They are entirely [[insectivorous]], feeding on the forest floor or on low branches, and preferring to nest in hollow trees and tree stumps. To shelter from the strong winds and rough seas around the islands, they spend a lot of time in the lower branches of the forest, or in flat areas with deep litter layers. They frequent woody vegetation under the canopies of trees such as [[akeake]].\n\n==Ecology and behaviour==\nBlack robins are territorial. Males will patrol and defend their areas. Females have been known to chase away other females. They make short flights from branch to branch and do not fly long distances.\n\n===Diet and feeding===\nBlack robins forage in the leaf litter on the ground for grubs, cockroaches, [[weta]], and worms. Black robins will hunt for food during the day and night and have good night vision.\n\n===Breeding===\nBlack robins will generally start to breed at two years of age. The female robin will make the nest, and while she lays and incubates the eggs, the male will feed the female for a rest.\n\nEggs are laid between early October and late December. A second clutch may be laid if the first is unsuccessful. The clutch size varies from one to three eggs, but two is typical. Eggs are creamy in colour with purple splotches. When the eggs are laid, the female will sit on them to keep them warm until they hatch, after about 18 days. Then both parents will help to feed the chicks. Young robins stay in the nest for about 23 days after hatching, but even after leaving the nest the parents will continue to feed them until they are about 65 days old. This period of parental care is longer than would normally be expected for a bird of this size. After leaving the nest, chicks often spend the first day or two on the ground learning to use their wings, and here they are exposed to predators.\n\n===Life expectancy===\nSurvivorship between 1980 and 1991 indicates a mean life expectancy of four years. \"[[Old Blue (black robin)|Old Blue]]\", the sole breeding female in 1980, lived for over 14 years. Some black robins can live from 6 to 13 years.\n\n==Conservation and distribution==\nThere are now around 250 black robins, but in 1980 only five survived on Little Mangere Island. They were saved from extinction by [[Don Merton]] and his [[New Zealand Wildlife Service|Wildlife Service]] team, and by \"Old Blue\", the last remaining fertile female. The remaining birds were moved to [[Mangere Island]]. The team increased the annual output of Old Blue (and later other females) by removing the first [[Clutch (eggs)|clutch]] every year and placing the eggs in the nest of the Chatham race of the [[tomtit]], a technique known as [[cross-fostering]]. The tomtits raised the first brood, and the black robins, having lost their eggs, relaid and raised another brood.<ref name=cemmick>{{cite book|last=Cemmick|first=David|title=Black Robin Country|year=1986|publisher=Hodder and Stoughton|location=Auckland|isbn=978-0-340-35826-9|pages=135|author2=Dick Veitch}}</ref>\n[[File:Petroica traversi (AM LB2068) (cropped).jpg|alt=Image of Petroica traversi nest from the collection of Auckland Museum|left|thumb|Petroica traversi nest from the collection of [[Auckland War Memorial Museum|Auckland Museum]]]]\nMany females laid eggs on the rims of nests where the eggs could not survive without help. Human conservationists pushed the eggs back into the nests where they were incubated and hatched successfully. The [[maladaptive]] [[gene]] causing this behaviour spread until over 50% of females laid rim eggs. Humans stopped pushing eggs back in time to prevent the gene spreading to all birds which could have made the birds dependent on humans indefinitely. After human intervention stopped, rim laying became less frequent, but 9% of birds still laid rim eggs as of 2011.
