The county borders [[Nevada]] and [[Oregon]].\n\nA large portion of Modoc County is [[federal land]]. Several federal agencies, including the [[United States Forest Service]], [[Bureau of Land Management]], [[National Park Service]], [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]], and the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service]], have employees assigned to the area, and their operations are a significant part of the area's economy and services.\n\nThe county's official slogans include \"The last best place\" and \"Where the West still lives\".\n\n==History==\nPrior to the arrival of Europeans in the region, varying cultures of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] inhabited the county for thousands of years. At the time of European encounter, the [[Modoc people|Modoc]] people lived in what is now northern California, near [[Lost River (California)|Lost River]] and [[Tule Lake]]. The county was named after them.<ref name=\"Hoover/Kyle\" />{{rp|216}} The  [[Achomawi|Achumawi]] (or Pit River Indians, for which the [[Pit River]] is named), and the [[Northern Paiute|Paiute]] also lived in the area.<ref name=\"Hoover/Kyle\" />{{rp|216}} To the north were the [[Klamath people|Klamath]] in present-day Oregon.\n\nThe first European explorers to visit Modoc County were the American [[John C. Fr\u00e9mont]] and his traveling party (including [[Kit Carson]]) in 1846, who had departed from [[Sutter's Fort]] near the confluence of the [[American River|American]] and [[Sacramento River]]s.  (This is where the city of [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]] lies today.)<ref name=\"Hoover/Kyle\" />{{rp|216}}\n\nThe northern boundary of California, and eventually Modoc County, had been established as the 42nd parallel since the time of Mexican possession.  In the absence of a reliable survey of the 120th meridian, the eastern boundary of northern California was a subject of contention before Modoc County formed. The [[Territory of Utah]] requested jurisdiction to the summit of the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]].  At the time, the [[Warner Mountains]] were believed to be a part of the Sierra Nevada, so this would have included [[Surprise Valley (Modoc County, California)|Surprise Valley]], but California denied the request.<ref name=\"Pease\">{{cite book | last = Pease | first = Robert W. | authorlink = | title = Modoc County; University of California Publications in Geography, Volume 17 | publisher = University of California Press | year = 1965 | location = Berkeley and Los Angeles| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B54iAQAAIAAJ |  isbn = }}</ref>{{rp|76\u201377}}\n\nIn 1856, the residents of [[Honey Lake Valley]] reckoned the 120th meridian to be west of their valley, placing them in Utah territory, and attempted to secede and form a territory they called [[Nataqua]].

Harassed by the Klamath, traditional competitors, a band of Modoc led by [[Captain Jack (Native American)|Captain Jack]] returned to California and the Tule Lake area.\n\nThe [[Modoc War]] (or [[Lava Beds War]]) of 1872-73 brought nationwide attention to the Modoc during the protracted battles.  From strong defensive positions in the [[lava tube]]s, 52 Modoc warriors held off hundreds of US Army forces, who called in artillery to help.<ref name=\"Hoover/Kyle\" />{{rp|218\u2013219}} Peace talks in 1873 stalled when the Modoc wanted their own reservation in California.  Warriors urged killing the peace commissioners, thinking that the Americans would then leave, and [[Captain Jack (Native American)|Captain Jack]] and others shot and killed General [[Edward Canby]] and Rev. Eleazer Thomas, and wounded others. More Army troops were called in to lay siege to Captain Jack's Stronghold.<ref name=CSMM>{{cite web |title=Modoc Wars, 1873-74|url=http://www.militarymuseum.org/Modoc1.html |year=2009 |website=|publisher=[[California State Military Museum]] |accessdate=21 July 2009}}</ref> Dissension arose, and some Modoc surrendered.  Finally, most were captured, and those responsible for the assassinations were tried and executed. More than 150 Modoc were transported to Indian Territory as prisoners of war.<ref name=\"Hoover/Kyle\" />{{rp|219}} The area has since been designated the [[Lava Beds National Monument]].\n\nSettlement of the county began in earnest in the 1870s, with the [[timber]], gold, agriculture, and [[railroad]] industries bringing most of the settlers into the area.  The county was a crossroads for the [[Applegate Trail|Lassen Applegate Trail]], which brought settlers north from [[Nevada]] to the [[Oregon Trail]] and south to trails leading into California's central valley.  Early settlers included the Dorris, Belli, Essex, Scherer, Trumbo, Flournoy, Polander, Rice and Campbell families.\n\nModoc County was formed when [[Newton Booth|Governor Newton Booth]] signed an Act of the California Legislature on February 17, 1874 after residents of the [[Surprise Valley (Modoc County, California)|Surprise Valley]] region lobbied for the creation of a new county from eastern [[Siskiyou County, California|Siskiyou County]] land.<ref name=\"Hoover/Kyle\" />{{rp|216}} The county residents considered naming the newly formed county after General [[Edward Canby]], who had been killed the year before at peace talks in an ambush by Modoc.  The idea of naming the county \"Summit\" was also considered, but the populace eventually settled on \"Modoc\"; the war was over and 153 of [[Captain Jack (Native American)|Captain Jack]]'s band had been transported to [[Indian Territory]] as prisoners.<ref name=ALCHA>{{cite web |title=Modoc County History |url=http://www.alturaschamber.org/history.htm |year=2009 |work=Alturas Chamber of Commerce |publisher=Modoc County Government |accessdate=21 July 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090617195609/http://www.alturaschamber.org/history.htm |archivedate=17 June 2009 }}</ref>\n\nThe Dorris Bridge post office opened in 1871,<ref name=CGN>{{California's Geographic Names|351}}</ref> was renamed Dorrisville in 1874; due to its central location, Dorrisville became the county seat when Modoc County formed that year, although both [[Adin, California|Adin]] and [[Cedarville, California|Cedarville]] were larger towns.<ref name=\"Pease\" />{{rp|84}}  In 1876, it was renamed Alturas, which means \"The Heights\" in Spanish.<ref name=gudde>{{cite book|first=Erwin|last=Gudde|author2=William Bright |title=California Place Names|year=2004|edition=Fourth|publisher=University of California Press|pages=10|isbn=0-520-24217-3}}</ref> The census of 1880 showed a population of 148.

[[Tule Lake War Relocation Center]] was the site of temporary exile for thousands of Japanese-American citizens, who lost most of their businesses and properties where they had formerly lived in coastal areas.

It is also (almost) the only rectangular county in California; there is a slight deviation around the [[Tule Lake National Wildlife Refuge]].\n\n[[File:MuleDeer ModocCounty.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[Mule deer]] in Modoc County]]\nThe county is very diverse geographically.  The northwestern edge of the county is dominated by the [[Medicine Lake Volcano|Medicine Lake]] Highlands, the largest [[shield volcano]] on the U.S. West Coast. The [[Lava Beds National Monument]] lies partly within the northwest corner of the County.  Also along the western edge of the county is the massive [[Glass Mountain lava flow]].  The southwestern corner of the county is a unique ecosystem of isolated hardwoods (oaks) and volcanic mountains with intermountain river valleys.\n\nThe northern half of the county is the [[Modoc Plateau]], a {{convert|1|mi|km|adj=on}} high expanse of lava flows, cinder cones, juniper flats, pine forests, and seasonal lakes, plus the alkaline [[Goose Lake (Oregon-California)|Goose Lake]].  Nearly 1 million acres (4,000&nbsp;km\u00b2) of the [[Modoc National Forest]] lie on the plateau between the Medicine Lake Highlands in the west and the [[Warner Mountains]] in the east.  The plateau supports large herds of [[mule deer]] (''Odocoileus hemionus''), [[Rocky Mountain Elk]] (''Cervus canadensis''), and [[pronghorn]] (''Antilocapra americana'').  There are also several herds of wild horses on the plateau.  The [[Clear Lake National Wildlife Refuge]] and [[Long Bell State Game Refuge]] are located on the plateau as well.  The Lost River watershed, which later drains into the [[Klamath River]] basin, drains the north part of the plateau, while southern watersheds either collect in basin reservoirs or flow into the large [[Big Sage Reservoir]], which sits in the center of the county, which later flows into the [[Pit River]].\n\nBelow the rim of the Plateau is [[Big Valley (Pit River)|Big Valley]] in the extreme southwest corner of the county, and the large [[Warm Springs Valley]] that forms the bottom of the [[Pit River]] watershed that runs through the county.  The north fork and south fork of the Pit River come together just south of Alturas.  The River collects hundreds of other small creeks as it flows south towards [[Lake Shasta]], where it joins the [[Sacramento River]] and drains into the [[San Francisco Bay]].\n\nThe eastern edge of the county is dominated by the [[Warner Mountains]].  The Pit River originates in this mountain range.  Hundreds of alpine lakes dot the range, all of which are fed by snow-melt and natural springs.  East of the Warner Range is [[Surprise Valley (Modoc County, California)|Surprise Valley]] and the western edge of the [[Great Basin]].\n\nHot Springs and lava caves are common to Modoc County.  There are some geothermal energy resources available in the county, though their viability is highly variable.  <!--tribal challenges to geothermal energy development in the Medicine Lake Highlands are on a site in [[Siskiyou County]]-->\n\nA great diversity of plants are found in Modoc County, since this is situated within the biodiverse [[California Floristic Province]]. Numerous native trees are found in the county including [[Garry Oak]] and [[Washoe Pine]] trees.<ref name=\"Hogan\">C.

The county borders [[Nevada]] and [[Oregon]].\n\nA large portion of Modoc County is [[federal land]]. Several federal agencies, including the [[United States Forest Service]], [[Bureau of Land Management]], [[National Park Service]], [[Bureau of Indian Affairs]], and the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service]], have employees assigned to the area, and their operations are a significant part of the area's economy and services.\n\nThe county's official slogans include \"The last best place\" and \"Where the West still lives\".\n\n==History==\nPrior to the arrival of Europeans in the region, varying cultures of [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] inhabited the county for thousands of years. At the time of European encounter, the [[Modoc people|Modoc]] people lived in what is now northern California, near [[Lost River (California)|Lost River]] and [[Tule Lake]]. The county was named after them.<ref name=\"Hoover/Kyle\" />{{rp|216}} The  [[Achomawi|Achumawi]] (or Pit River Indians, for which the [[Pit River]] is named), and the [[Northern Paiute|Paiute]] also lived in the area.<ref name=\"Hoover/Kyle\" />{{rp|216}} To the north were the [[Klamath people|Klamath]] in present-day Oregon.\n\nThe first European explorers to visit Modoc County were the American [[John C. Fr\u00e9mont]] and his traveling party (including [[Kit Carson]]) in 1846, who had departed from [[Sutter's Fort]] near the confluence of the [[American River|American]] and [[Sacramento River]]s.  (This is where the city of [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]] lies today.)<ref name=\"Hoover/Kyle\" />{{rp|216}}\n\nThe northern boundary of California, and eventually Modoc County, had been established as the 42nd parallel since the time of Mexican possession.  In the absence of a reliable survey of the 120th meridian, the eastern boundary of northern California was a subject of contention before Modoc County formed. The [[Territory of Utah]] requested jurisdiction to the summit of the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]].  At the time, the [[Warner Mountains]] were believed to be a part of the Sierra Nevada, so this would have included [[Surprise Valley (Modoc County, California)|Surprise Valley]], but California denied the request.<ref name=\"Pease\">{{cite book | last = Pease | first = Robert W. | authorlink = | title = Modoc County; University of California Publications in Geography, Volume 17 | publisher = University of California Press | year = 1965 | location = Berkeley and Los Angeles| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B54iAQAAIAAJ |  isbn = }}</ref>{{rp|76\u201377}}\n\nIn 1856, the residents of [[Honey Lake Valley]] reckoned the 120th meridian to be west of their valley, placing them in Utah territory, and attempted to secede and form a territory they called [[Nataqua]]. Nataqua would have included Modoc County.<ref name='Nataqua News'>{{cite news | first= | last= |authorlink= | title=Reprinted from a previous issue... | year=1997 | publisher=Thumbs Up Publishing | url =http://www.ectownusa.com/Nataqua/whatisnataqua.html | work =Nataqua News | pages = | accessdate = 2010-04-05 | language = }}</ref>  In 1858, the [[Territory of Nevada]], with its capital now in Carson City, successfully seceded from Utah, and assumed jurisdiction to the summit of the Sierra Nevada until the 120th meridian was surveyed in 1863.<ref name=\"Pease\" />{{rp|76\u201377}}\n\nAfter Nevada was granted statehood in 1864, the region of current Modoc County was placed within jurisdiction of [[Shasta County, California]], and [[Siskiyou County, California|Siskiyou County]] was, in turn, generated from [[Shasta County, California|Shasta County]] in 1852.<ref name=ALCHA />\n\nIncreasing traffic on the emigrant trail, unprovoked militia raids on innocent Modoc, and a cycle of retaliatory raids increased a cycle of violence between settlers and the tribes in the area.<ref name=\"Hoover/Kyle\">{{cite book|author1=Mildred Brooke Hoover|author2=Douglas E.

Harassed by the Klamath, traditional competitors, a band of Modoc led by [[Captain Jack (Native American)|Captain Jack]] returned to California and the Tule Lake area.\n\nThe [[Modoc War]] (or [[Lava Beds War]]) of 1872-73 brought nationwide attention to the Modoc during the protracted battles.  From strong defensive positions in the [[lava tube]]s, 52 Modoc warriors held off hundreds of US Army forces, who called in artillery to help.<ref name=\"Hoover/Kyle\" />{{rp|218\u2013219}} Peace talks in 1873 stalled when the Modoc wanted their own reservation in California.  Warriors urged killing the peace commissioners, thinking that the Americans would then leave, and [[Captain Jack (Native American)|Captain Jack]] and others shot and killed General [[Edward Canby]] and Rev. Eleazer Thomas, and wounded others. More Army troops were called in to lay siege to Captain Jack's Stronghold.<ref name=CSMM>{{cite web |title=Modoc Wars, 1873-74|url=http://www.militarymuseum.org/Modoc1.html |year=2009 |website=|publisher=[[California State Military Museum]] |accessdate=21 July 2009}}</ref> Dissension arose, and some Modoc surrendered.  Finally, most were captured, and those responsible for the assassinations were tried and executed. More than 150 Modoc were transported to Indian Territory as prisoners of war.<ref name=\"Hoover/Kyle\" />{{rp|219}} The area has since been designated the [[Lava Beds National Monument]].\n\nSettlement of the county began in earnest in the 1870s, with the [[timber]], gold, agriculture, and [[railroad]] industries bringing most of the settlers into the area.  The county was a crossroads for the [[Applegate Trail|Lassen Applegate Trail]], which brought settlers north from [[Nevada]] to the [[Oregon Trail]] and south to trails leading into California's central valley.  Early settlers included the Dorris, Belli, Essex, Scherer, Trumbo, Flournoy, Polander, Rice and Campbell families.\n\nModoc County was formed when [[Newton Booth|Governor Newton Booth]] signed an Act of the California Legislature on February 17, 1874 after residents of the [[Surprise Valley (Modoc County, California)|Surprise Valley]] region lobbied for the creation of a new county from eastern [[Siskiyou County, California|Siskiyou County]] land.<ref name=\"Hoover/Kyle\" />{{rp|216}} The county residents considered naming the newly formed county after General [[Edward Canby]], who had been killed the year before at peace talks in an ambush by Modoc.  The idea of naming the county \"Summit\" was also considered, but the populace eventually settled on \"Modoc\"; the war was over and 153 of [[Captain Jack (Native American)|Captain Jack]]'s band had been transported to [[Indian Territory]] as prisoners.<ref name=ALCHA>{{cite web |title=Modoc County History |url=http://www.alturaschamber.org/history.htm |year=2009 |work=Alturas Chamber of Commerce |publisher=Modoc County Government |accessdate=21 July 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090617195609/http://www.alturaschamber.org/history.htm |archivedate=17 June 2009 }}</ref>\n\nThe Dorris Bridge post office opened in 1871,<ref name=CGN>{{California's Geographic Names|351}}</ref> was renamed Dorrisville in 1874; due to its central location, Dorrisville became the county seat when Modoc County formed that year, although both [[Adin, California|Adin]] and [[Cedarville, California|Cedarville]] were larger towns.<ref name=\"Pease\" />{{rp|84}}  In 1876, it was renamed Alturas, which means \"The Heights\" in Spanish.<ref name=gudde>{{cite book|first=Erwin|last=Gudde|author2=William Bright |title=California Place Names|year=2004|edition=Fourth|publisher=University of California Press|pages=10|isbn=0-520-24217-3}}</ref> The census of 1880 showed a population of 148.

[[Tule Lake War Relocation Center]] was the site of temporary exile for thousands of Japanese-American citizens, who lost most of their businesses and properties where they had formerly lived in coastal areas.  A historical marker marks the site along [[California State Route 139|State Route 139]] in Newell.\n\nTule Lake was the largest of the \"segregation camps.\"  On November 8, 2005 [[Dianne Feinstein|Senator Dianne Feinstein]] called for the camp to be designated a [[National Historic Landmark]]. In December 2008 it was designated by President [[George W. Bush]] as one of nine sites to be part of the new [[World War II Valor in the Pacific National Monument]], now the [[Tule Lake National Monument]].\n\n==Geography==\nAccording to the [[U.S. Census Bureau]], the county has a total area of {{convert|4203|sqmi}}, of which {{convert|3918|sqmi}} is land and {{convert|286|sqmi}} (6.8%) is water.<ref name=\"GR1\">{{cite web|url=http://www2.census.gov/geo/docs/maps-data/data/gazetteer/counties_list_06.txt|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=September 28, 2015|date=August 22, 2012|title=2010 Census Gazetteer Files}}</ref>\n\nThere are 2.25 persons per square mile, making this one of the most sparsely populated counties in California. It is also (almost) the only rectangular county in California; there is a slight deviation around the [[Tule Lake National Wildlife Refuge]].\n\n[[File:MuleDeer ModocCounty.jpg|thumb|250px|right|[[Mule deer]] in Modoc County]]\nThe county is very diverse geographically.  The northwestern edge of the county is dominated by the [[Medicine Lake Volcano|Medicine Lake]] Highlands, the largest [[shield volcano]] on the U.S. West Coast. The [[Lava Beds National Monument]] lies partly within the northwest corner of the County.  Also along the western edge of the county is the massive [[Glass Mountain lava flow]].  The southwestern corner of the county is a unique ecosystem of isolated hardwoods (oaks) and volcanic mountains with intermountain river valleys.\n\nThe northern half of the county is the [[Modoc Plateau]], a {{convert|1|mi|km|adj=on}} high expanse of lava flows, cinder cones, juniper flats, pine forests, and seasonal lakes, plus the alkaline [[Goose Lake (Oregon-California)|Goose Lake]].  Nearly 1 million acres (4,000&nbsp;km\u00b2) of the [[Modoc National Forest]] lie on the plateau between the Medicine Lake Highlands in the west and the [[Warner Mountains]] in the east.  The plateau supports large herds of [[mule deer]] (''Odocoileus hemionus''), [[Rocky Mountain Elk]] (''Cervus canadensis''), and [[pronghorn]] (''Antilocapra americana'').  There are also several herds of wild horses on the plateau.  The [[Clear Lake National Wildlife Refuge]] and [[Long Bell State Game Refuge]] are located on the plateau as well.  The Lost River watershed, which later drains into the [[Klamath River]] basin, drains the north part of the plateau, while southern watersheds either collect in basin reservoirs or flow into the large [[Big Sage Reservoir]], which sits in the center of the county, which later flows into the [[Pit River]].\n\nBelow the rim of the Plateau is [[Big Valley (Pit River)|Big Valley]] in the extreme southwest corner of the county, and the large [[Warm Springs Valley]] that forms the bottom of the [[Pit River]] watershed that runs through the county.  The north fork and south fork of the Pit River come together just south of Alturas.  The River collects hundreds of other small creeks as it flows south towards [[Lake Shasta]], where it joins the [[Sacramento River]] and drains into the [[San Francisco Bay]].\n\nThe eastern edge of the county is dominated by the [[Warner Mountains]].  The Pit River originates in this mountain range.  Hundreds of alpine lakes dot the range, all of which are fed by snow-melt and natural springs.  East of the Warner Range is [[Surprise Valley (Modoc County, California)|Surprise Valley]] and the western edge of the [[Great Basin]].\n\nHot Springs and lava caves are common to Modoc County.  There are some geothermal energy resources available in the county, though their viability is highly variable.  <!--tribal challenges to geothermal energy development in the Medicine Lake Highlands are on a site in [[Siskiyou County]]-->\n\nA great diversity of plants are found in Modoc County, since this is situated within the biodiverse [[California Floristic Province]]. Numerous native trees are found in the county including [[Garry Oak]] and [[Washoe Pine]] trees.<ref name=\"Hogan\">C.

Armenian Cilicia}}</ref> Leo eagerly led his kingdom alongside the armies of the [[Third Crusade]] and provided the crusaders with provisions, guides, [[pack animal]]s and all manner of aid.<ref name='Kurkjian'/> Under his rule, Armenian power in Cilicia was at its apogee: his kingdom extended from [[Isauria]] to the [[Nur Mountains|Amanus Mountains]].<ref name='Nersessian'/>\n\nIn 1194\u20131195, when he was planning to receive the title of [[king]], he instituted [[Full communion|a union]] of the [[Holy See of Cilicia|Armenian church]] with [[Pope|Rome]].<ref name='Hardwicke'/> With the signing of the Act of Union, his [[coronation]] proceeded without delay.<ref name='Ghazarian'/> He was consecrated as king on 6 January 1198<ref name='Runciman'/> or 1199, in the Church of Holy Wisdom at [[Tarsus (city)|Tarsus]].<ref name='Ghazarian'/> His accession to the throne of Cilicia as its first Armenian monarch heralded into reality not merely an official end to Cilicia's shadowy umbilical connection to the [[Byzantine Empire]], but also a new era of ecclesiastical co-operation with the West.<ref name='Ghazarian'/> A skilled diplomat and wise politician, Leo established useful alliances with many of the contemporary rulers; he also gained the friendship and support of the [[Hospitallers]] and the [[Teutonic Knights]] by granting considerable territories to them.<ref name='Nersessian'/><ref name='Edwards'/>\n\nHe envisioned annexing the [[Principality of Antioch]] to his kingdom, thus reinforcing his authority along much of the northeastern [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] coastline.<ref name='Ghazarian'/> Levon first put this plan into action in 1194 by seizing the strategic fortress of [[Baghras]] after [[Saladin]], the Sultan of [[Egypt]] and [[Syria]],<ref name='Runciman'/> had abandoned it.<ref name='Ghazarian'/> His greatest triumph was achieved at the beginning of 1216 when at the head of his army he occupied [[Antioch]] and installed his grandnephew, [[Raymond-Roupen, Prince of Antioch|Raymond-Roupen]] as its head.<ref name='Ghazarian'/> Raymond-Roupen remained in power until Leo's death.<ref name='Ghazarian'/> The transforming of the Armenian [[Royal Household|court]], following the pattern of the Frankish courts, proceeded at a more rapid pace after Leo came to power.<ref name='Nersessian'/> Many of the old names of specific functions or the titles of dignitaries were replaced by [[Latin]] ones and the changes in nomenclature were often accompanied by changes in the character of these offices.<ref name='Nersessian'/>\n\nCommerce was greatly developed during the reign of Leo:<ref name='Nersessian'/> he granted charters regarding trade and commercial [[Privilege (legal ethics)|privilege]]s to [[Republic of Genoa|Genoa]], [[Republic of Venice|Venice]] and [[Republic of Pisa|Pisa]].<ref name='Ghazarian'/> These [[charters]] provided their holders with special [[tax exemption]]s in exchange for their merchandising trade.<ref name='Ghazarian'/> They encouraged the establishment of [[Italians|Italian]] merchant communities in Tarsus, [[Adana]] and [[Mamistra]], and became a large source of revenue for the growth and development of Cilician Armenia.<ref name='Ghazarian'/>\n\n==Early years==\nHe was the younger son of [[Stephen of Armenia|Stephen]], the third son of [[Leo I, Prince of Armenia|Leo I, lord of Armenian Cilicia]].<ref name='Cawley'/> His mother was [[Rita of Barbaron|Rita]], a daughter of [[Lords of Barbaron|Sempad, Lord of Barbaron]].<ref name='Cawley'/> Leo's father, who was on his way to attend a banquet given by the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] governor of [[Cilicia]], [[Andronicus Euphorbenus]],<ref name='Ghazarian'/> was murdered<ref name='Runciman'/> on  7 February 1165.<ref name='Cawley'/> Following their father's death, Leo and his elder brother Roupen lived with their maternal uncle, [[Lords of Barbaron|Pagouran]], lord of the fortress of [[Barbaron]], protecting the [[Cilician Gates]] pass in the [[Taurus Mountains]].<ref name='Ghazarian'/><ref name='Edwards'/>\n\nTheir paternal uncle, [[Mleh, Prince of Armenia|Mleh I, lord of Armenian Cilicia]] had made a host of enemies by his cruelties in his country, resulting in his assassination by his own soldiers in [[Kozan, Adana|the city of Sis]] in 1175.<ref name='Kurkjian'/> The seigneurs of Cilician Armenia elected Leo's brother, Roupen III to occupy the throne of the principality.<ref name='Kurkjian'/> In 1183, [[Hethum III of Lampron]], allied with Prince [[Bohemond III of Antioch]], began joint hostilities against Roupen III<ref name='Ghazarian'/> who sent Leo to surround Hethum's mountain lair.<ref name='Kurkjian'/> But Bohemond III, rushing to the aid of Hethum, treacherously made Roupen prisoner.<ref name='Kurkjian'/>\n\nHis brother's absence gave Leo the opportunity to put his sharp political skills to practice as the interim guardian of the [[Rubenids|Roupenian House]].<ref name='Ghazarian'/> Roupen's release required payment of a large ransom, and the submission of Adana and Mamistra as vassalages to Antioch.<ref name='Ghazarian'/> When Roupen returned from the captivity, he transferred the power to his brother, Leo (1187) and retired to the monastery of Trazarg.<ref name='Nersessian'/>\n\n==His rule==\n\n===Prince of Cilicia===\nThe menace of the recent alliance between the Byzantine Emperor [[Isaac II Angelos]] and [[Saladin]], and the more immediate threat of the [[Oghuz Turks|Turkomans]], led to a rapprochement between Leo and Bohemond III:<ref name='Nersessian'/> on his accession Leo sought an alliance with the prince of Antioch and recognized his suzerainty.<ref name='Runciman'/> Large bands of the nomad Turkomans had been crossing the northern borders, advancing almost as far as Sis and laying waste on all sides;<ref name='Nersessian'/> the two princes joined to beat off a Turcoman raid in 1187.<ref name='Runciman'/> Leo could muster only a small force, but he attacked them with such energy that he routed the bands, killed their leader, and pursued the fugitives as far as [[Sarventikar]], inflicting heavy losses on them.<ref name='Nersessian'/> Soon afterwards (between 3 February 1188/4 February 1189),<ref name='Cawley'/> Leo married [[Isabella (wife of Leo I of Armenia)|Isabella]], a niece of Bohemond III's wife [[Sybilla (wife of Bohemond III of Antioch)|Sibylla]].<ref name='Runciman'/>\n\nThe

Roustam himself being killed by [[St. George]], the whole [[Hagarenes|Hagarenian]] army then fled and dispersed; the Armenians pursued them and enriched themselves by the booty. The power of Leo thus increased, and being confident in his strength, he chased the Tadjiks [name used by Armenian chroniclers to designate the Saracens, particularly the Seljuks] and pursued the [[Turkic peoples|Turks]]; he conquered Isauria and came as far as [[Iconium]]; he captured [[Heraclea Cybistra|Heraclea]], and again gave it up for a large ransom; he blockaded [[Kayseri|Caesarea]], and had nearly taken it; he made a treaty with the [[Sultanate of R\u00fbm|Sultan of Iconium]], and received a large sum of money from him;

It was built as a modern [[planned city]] with high standards of urban planning. Environmental issues and future growth were taken into consideration from the early design stages. Large [[Open space reserve|greenspace]]s were incorporated into the city's layout and comprise 50% of the area within the city limits. The city was opened for residency in 1996.\n\n===Modi'in-Maccabim-Re'ut===\nIn 2003, the Israeli Interior Ministry unified Modi'in and Maccabim-Reut into a single city.\n\n==Population development==\n[[File:Modi'in 02006.JPG|thumb|180px|High-rise development in Modi'in]]\nModi'in has become a magnet for [[Jerusalem]] residents displeased with the capital's growing Haredi character.<ref name=\"haaretz.com\">{{cite web |url= http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/business/was-building-city-of-modi-in-a-mistake-1.249671 |title= Was building the city of Modi'in a mistake? - Business |author= |date= |work= haaretz.com}}</ref> Thousands of residents of [[Rosh HaAyin]], [[Lod]], and [[Ramla]] have also relocated to Modi'in.<ref name=\"haaretz.com\"/> In 2008, it was decided to cap the growth of Modi'in to allow for the development of Lod and Ramla.<ref name=\"haaretz.com\"/> The city was planned by the well-known architect [[Moshe Safdie]].\n\n==Territorial status controversy==\nIn 2012, the European Union reclassified the small part of Modi'in originally founded as the community of Maccabim as a [[Israeli settlements|West Bank settlement]] since it had been established in the [[Latrun salient]] [[no man's land]] according to the [[1949 Armistice Agreements|1949 Armistice Agreement]]. The effect of this redefinition was to deny the affected area (which is exclusively green-leaf residential) a range of preferential tax benefits that would normally be conceded on Israeli products exported to Europe.<ref name=\"Coren\">Ora Coren,\u2002 [http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/european-union-parts-of-modi-in-do-not-belong-to-israel-1.458222 'European Union: Parts of Modi'in Do Not Belong to Israel'], [[Haaretz]], 14  August 2012</ref> The decision was made to implement a 2010 ruling of the [[Court of Justice of the European Union]].<ref name=\"Coren\" /> The move sparked off a diplomatic controversy.\n\n==Socio-economic status==\nAccording to the Israel Central Bureau of Statistics, the city is rated at level 8 out of 10 on the scale of socio-economic development, with a high proportion of high school graduation, 76.5% (2006\u201307), and an average monthly income of 9,659 [[Israeli new shekel|NIS]], compared to a national average of 7,466 (2006).

Each side of the artery is a one-way street, and in between is a wide [[Greenway (landscape)|green space]], with [[linear park]]s, playgrounds, schools, and some small commercial centers. Short lateral stubs fed by [[continuous-flow intersection]] turn lanes allow drivers to traverse the green spaces and effect a U-turn onto the artery's opposite direction lanes. These stubs also serve as the entranceways for the schools and mini-malls, preventing parking traffic from blocking the high-speed, left lanes of the arteries. The right shoulders of most arteries do, however, allow parking, except in the pullouts for bus stops, next to fire hydrants, etc.\n\nThe city center is a large [[traffic circle]] punctuated by [[traffic light]]s. On the north side of the circle is the [[Modi'in Central Railway Station|central train station]], to the northeast is the Azrieli [[shopping mall]] (pictured), and to the west and south is the Anaba park (also pictured), which contains a small <!-- DON'T wikilink --> artificial lake <!-- redirects to \"reservoir,\" and this is NOT a reservoir --> used for recreational [[boating]]. The traffic circle straddles a major northeast\u2013southwest artery, HaHashmona'im Blvd., that connects to the southwest with [[Route 431 (Israel)|route 431]] (which has its eastern terminus in south Modi'in and extends west to [[Rishon LeZion]]), and to the northeast with [[Route 443 (Israel)|route 443]] (at Shilat Junction) providing connectivity to [[Jerusalem]] (southeast) and [[Lod]] (northwest).\n\nApproximately {{convert|5|km|0|abbr=in}} west-northwest of the city center is an industrial zone, and to the west (on route 431) is the Yishpro commercial center. The latter is also accessible via an additional Modi'in train station, [[Paatei Modi'in Railway Station|Paatei Modi'in]] ({{lang-he|\u05e4\u05d0\u05ea\u05d9 \u05de\u05d5\u05d3\u05d9\u05e2\u05d9\u05df}}, \"Modi'in outskirts\"). The industrial zone is also linked to route 443 via its own interchange, between Shilat Junction and the Maccabim Junction at the eastern side of the Ben Shemen [[Jewish National Fund|JNF]] forest. This keeps most of the commercial traffic out of the city proper, so that the two arteries between the city and its industrial zone (Emek HaEla and HaShdera Hamerkazit) carry primarily commuters rather than trucks.\n\nThe long-term projection of the Ministry of Housing is for the city to be home to 240,000 residents. However, plans approved thus far are for 120,000 residents.\n\n===Neighborhoods===\n[[File:Modiin Map 2011.png|thumb|Neighborhoods of Modi'in-Maccabim-Re'ut]]\n[[File:Parkmodi.JPG|thumb|Park Modi'in]]\n\n\u05d4\u05e9\u05d1\u05d8\u05d9\u05dd ''HaShvatim'' - The Tribes (North Buchman/Buchman) and \u05de\u05d5\u05e8\u05d9\u05d4 ''Moriah'' (South Buchman) are the most southern neighborhoods in the city. Most of the buildings in this neighborhood are ground-level private homes and condos. The streets of Shvatim are named after the [[The Twelve Tribes|tribes of Israel]], and the streets of Moriah are named after ancient historical Jewish figures. Moriah, the name of the southern neighborhood, is also a feminine name representing these women.\n\n\u05d4\u05e4\u05e8\u05d7\u05d9\u05dd ''HaPrachim'' - The Flowers (Miromi) is a small neighborhood in the city center. Located in HaPrachim is a commercial center, two primary schools and a secondary school. The neighborhood's streets are named after trees, flowers, and plants. At the northern part of the neighborhood there is a small compound where the streets are named after phrases from the [[Song of Songs]].\n\n\u05d4\u05e0\u05d7\u05dc\u05d9\u05dd ''HaNachlim'' - The Rivers (Safdie) and \u05de\u05e9\u05d5\u05d0\u05d4 ''Masuah'' - Beacon (Givat C) are located towards the west of the city, and were planned by architect [[Moshe Safdie]]. Located in these neighborhoods are five commercial centers, a secondary school and three primary schools. The central street names are named after valleys in Israel, and the side streets are named after Israeli rivers and streets. The name \"Masuah\" was selected in order to represent the neighborhood's high altitude. Within the area consisting of the streets named after rivers and streams is the \"Malibu\" area, which, as with other areas, is colloquially named after the contractor who designed the neighborhood.\n\n\u05d4\u05db\u05e8\u05de\u05d9\u05dd ''HaKramim'' - The Vineyards (Tsipor) is the northernmost neighborhood in Modi'in.  The streets are named after the Hebrew months. The name \"Kramim\" is in honor of the vineyards that were located where the neighborhood now stands before the city was founded.\n\n\u05d0\u05d1\u05e0\u05d9 \u05d7\u05df ''Avnei Chen'' - Precious Stones (Kaizer) is located towards the west of the city, and parts of it are still under construction. The main road is named \"Avnei Choshen\" and leads to the only retail under residential mixed use buildings in Modi'in.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} Other streets, in keeping with the neighborhood's name, are named for precious stones. The parks are connected through the center of the neighborhood and allow pedestrians to cross. A bike lane in the Emek Zvuloon street leads to the center of town.\n\n\u05d4\u05e0\u05d1\u05d9\u05d0\u05d9\u05dd ''HaNevi'im'' - The Prophets (Northern Shimshoni) and \u05d4\u05de\u05d2\u05d9\u05e0\u05d9\u05dd ''HaMeginim'' - The Defenders (Southern Shimshoni) are located towards the northwest of the city. Streets in HaNevi'im are named for the [[Prophets in Judaism|Prophets of Israel]], while HaMeginim's streets are named after [[general]]s and important battles in Israeli history. Located in the neighborhoods are three commercial centers, three primary schools, and one secondary school.\n\n\u05d4\u05e6\u05d9\u05e4\u05d5\u05e8\u05d9\u05dd ''HaTsiporim'' - The Birds (South Kaizer) is still being planned. Its streets will be named after different species of birds, and will be a relatively small neighborhood consisting of only seven streets.\n\n==Culture==\n[[File:PikiWiki Israel 8234 clture auditorium in modiin.jpg|thumb|right|Modi'in cultural auditorium]]\n\n==Sports==\n===Baseball===\nIn 2007, Modi'in was selected as one of the inaugural cities for the [[Israel Baseball League]]. The baseball team was named the [[Modi'in Miracle]], but did not play games in Modi'in as there is no baseball stadium there.\n\n===American Football===\nIn 2008, the Pioneers of the [[Israeli Football League]] (American Football) relocated to Modi'in. The Pioneers played all their home games in Modi'in. In their first year, the Modi'in \"Dancing Camel\" Pioneers won the IFL Championship. After an unsuccessful 2009\u201310 season, their second in Modi'in, the Pioneers relocated once again to Tel Aviv, where most of the team's players lived.\n\n==Transportation==\n[[File:ModBahn006.jpg|thumb|right|View towards Modi'in Central Railway Station and main commercial district]]\nModi'in-Maccabim-Re'ut is accessible by [[Route 431 (Israel)|Road 431]], [[Highway 3 (Israel)|Highway 3]] and [[Route 443 (Israel)|Road 443]].\n\nA [[Israel Railways]] line began operation on April 1, 2008 to a [[Modi'in Central Railway Station|large underground station in Modi'in]].

It was built as a modern [[planned city]] with high standards of urban planning. Environmental issues and future growth were taken into consideration from the early design stages. Large [[Open space reserve|greenspace]]s were incorporated into the city's layout and comprise 50% of the area within the city limits. The city was opened for residency in 1996.\n\n===Modi'in-Maccabim-Re'ut===\nIn 2003, the Israeli Interior Ministry unified Modi'in and Maccabim-Reut into a single city.\n\n==Population development==\n[[File:Modi'in 02006.JPG|thumb|180px|High-rise development in Modi'in]]\nModi'in has become a magnet for [[Jerusalem]] residents displeased with the capital's growing Haredi character.<ref name=\"haaretz.com\">{{cite web |url= http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/business/was-building-city-of-modi-in-a-mistake-1.249671 |title= Was building the city of Modi'in a mistake? - Business |author= |date= |work= haaretz.com}}</ref> Thousands of residents of [[Rosh HaAyin]], [[Lod]], and [[Ramla]] have also relocated to Modi'in.<ref name=\"haaretz.com\"/> In 2008, it was decided to cap the growth of Modi'in to allow for the development of Lod and Ramla.<ref name=\"haaretz.com\"/> The city was planned by the well-known architect [[Moshe Safdie]].\n\n==Territorial status controversy==\nIn 2012, the European Union reclassified the small part of Modi'in originally founded as the community of Maccabim as a [[Israeli settlements|West Bank settlement]] since it had been established in the [[Latrun salient]] [[no man's land]] according to the [[1949 Armistice Agreements|1949 Armistice Agreement]].

Each side of the artery is a one-way street, and in between is a wide [[Greenway (landscape)|green space]], with [[linear park]]s, playgrounds, schools, and some small commercial centers. Short lateral stubs fed by [[continuous-flow intersection]] turn lanes allow drivers to traverse the green spaces and effect a U-turn onto the artery's opposite direction lanes. These stubs also serve as the entranceways for the schools and mini-malls, preventing parking traffic from blocking the high-speed, left lanes of the arteries. The right shoulders of most arteries do, however, allow parking, except in the pullouts for bus stops, next to fire hydrants, etc.\n\nThe city center is a large [[traffic circle]] punctuated by [[traffic light]]s. On the north side of the circle is the [[Modi'in Central Railway Station|central train station]], to the northeast is the Azrieli [[shopping mall]] (pictured), and to the west and south is the Anaba park (also pictured), which contains a small <!-- DON'T wikilink --> artificial lake <!-- redirects to \"reservoir,\" and this is NOT a reservoir --> used for recreational [[boating]]. The traffic circle straddles a major northeast-southwest artery, HaHashmona'im Blvd., that connects to the southwest with [[Route 431 (Israel)|route 431]] (which has its eastern terminus in south Modi'in and extends west to [[Rishon LeZion]]), and to the northeast with [[Route 443 (Israel)|route 443]] (at Shilat Junction) providing connectivity to [[Jerusalem]] (southeast) and [[Lod]] (northwest).\n\nApproximately {{convert|5|km|0|abbr=in}} west-northwest of the city center is an industrial zone, and to the west (on route 431) is the Yishpro commercial center. The latter is also accessible via an additional Modi'in train station, [[Paatei Modi'in Railway Station|Paatei Modi'in]] ({{lang-he|\u05e4\u05d0\u05ea\u05d9 \u05de\u05d5\u05d3\u05d9\u05e2\u05d9\u05df}}, \"Modi'in outskirts\"). The industrial zone is also linked to route 443 via its own interchange, between Shilat Junction and the Maccabim Junction at the eastern side of the Ben Shemen [[Jewish National Fund|JNF]] forest. This keeps most of the commercial traffic out of the city proper, so that the two arteries between the city and its industrial zone (Emek HaEla and HaShdera Hamerkazit) carry primarily commuters rather than trucks.\n\nThe long-term projection of the Ministry of Housing is for the city to be home to 240,000 residents. However, plans approved thus far are for 120,000 residents.\n\n===Neighborhoods===\n[[File:Modiin Map 2011.png|thumb|Neighborhoods of Modi'in-Maccabim-Re'ut]]\n[[File:Parkmodi.JPG|thumb|Park Modi'in]]\n\n\u05d4\u05e9\u05d1\u05d8\u05d9\u05dd ''HaShvatim'' - The Tribes (North Buchman/Buchman) and \u05de\u05d5\u05e8\u05d9\u05d4 ''Moriah'' (South Buchman) are the most southern neighborhoods in the city. Most of the buildings in this neighborhood are ground-level private homes and condos. The streets of Shvatim are named after the [[The Twelve Tribes|tribes of Israel]], and the streets of Moriah are named after ancient historical Jewish figures. Moriah, the name of the southern neighborhood, is also a feminine name representing these women.\n\n\u05d4\u05e4\u05e8\u05d7\u05d9\u05dd ''HaPrachim'' - The Flowers (Miromi) is a small neighborhood in the city center. Located in HaPrachim is a commercial center, two primary schools and a secondary school. The neighborhood's streets are named after trees, flowers, and plants. At the northern part of the neighborhood there is a small compound where the streets are named after phrases from the [[Song of Songs]].\n\n\u05d4\u05e0\u05d7\u05dc\u05d9\u05dd ''HaNachlim'' - The Rivers (Safdie) and \u05de\u05e9\u05d5\u05d0\u05d4 ''Masuah'' - Beacon (Givat C) are located towards the west of the city, and were planned by architect [[Moshe Safdie]]. Located in these neighborhoods are five commercial centers, a secondary school and three primary schools. The central street names are named after valleys in Israel, and the side streets are named after Israeli rivers and streets. The name \"Masuah\" was selected in order to represent the neighborhood's high altitude. Within the area consisting of the streets named after rivers and streams is the \"Malibu\" area, which, as with other areas, is colloquially named after the contractor who designed the neighborhood.\n\n\u05d4\u05db\u05e8\u05de\u05d9\u05dd ''HaKramim'' - The Vineyards (Tsipor) is the northernmost neighborhood in Modi'in.  The streets are named after the Hebrew months. The name \"Kramim\" is in honor of the vineyards that were located where the neighborhood now stands before the city was founded.\n\n\u05d0\u05d1\u05e0\u05d9 \u05d7\u05df ''Avnei Chen'' - Precious Stones (Kaizer) is located towards the west of the city, and parts of it are still under construction. The main road is named \"Avnei Choshen\" and leads to the only retail under residential mixed use buildings in Modi'in.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}} Other streets, in keeping with the neighborhood's name, are named for precious stones. The parks are connected through the center of the neighborhood and allow pedestrians to cross. A bike lane in the Emek Zvuloon street leads to the center of town.\n\n\u05d4\u05e0\u05d1\u05d9\u05d0\u05d9\u05dd ''HaNevi'im'' - The Prophets (Northern Shimshoni) and \u05d4\u05de\u05d2\u05d9\u05e0\u05d9\u05dd ''HaMeginim'' - The Defenders (Southern Shimshoni) are located towards the northwest of the city. Streets in HaNevi'im are named for the [[Prophets in Judaism|Prophets of Israel]], while HaMeginim's streets are named after [[general]]s and important battles in Israeli history. Located in the neighborhoods are three commercial centers, three primary schools, and one secondary school.\n\n\u05d4\u05e6\u05d9\u05e4\u05d5\u05e8\u05d9\u05dd ''HaTsiporim'' - The Birds (South Kaizer) is still being planned. Its streets will be named after different species of birds, and will be a relatively small neighborhood consisting of only seven streets.\n\n==Culture==\n[[File:PikiWiki Israel 8234 clture auditorium in modiin.jpg|thumb|right|Modi'in cultural auditorium]]\n\n==Sports==\n===Baseball===\nIn 2007, Modi'in was selected as one of the inaugural cities for the [[Israel Baseball League]]. The baseball team was named the [[Modi'in Miracle]], but did not play games in Modi'in as there is no baseball stadium there.\n\n===American Football===\nIn 2008, the Pioneers of the [[Israeli Football League]] (American Football) relocated to Modi'in. The Pioneers played all their home games in Modi'in. In their first year, the Modi'in \"Dancing Camel\" Pioneers won the IFL Championship. After an unsuccessful 2009-10 season, their second in Modi'in, the Pioneers relocated once again to Tel Aviv, where most of the team's players lived.\n\n==Transportation==\n[[File:ModBahn006.jpg|thumb|right|View towards Modi'in Central Railway Station and main commercial district]]\nModi'in-Maccabim-Re'ut is accessible by [[Route 431 (Israel)|Road 431]], [[Highway 3 (Israel)|Highway 3]] and [[Route 443 (Israel)|Road 443]].\n\nA [[Israel Railways]] line began operation on April 1, 2008 to a [[Modi'in Central Railway Station|large underground station in Modi'in]].

They began performing occasionally in 2011, conducted a short [[Queen + Adam Lambert Tour 2012|European tour]] in 2012, and in 2014 announced a world tour, the [[Queen + Adam Lambert Tour 2014\u20132015]] with dates in North America, Australia, New Zealand, Asia, Europe and South America. In the summer of 2016, the group performed several dates as part of a festival tour in Europe and several dates in Asia. The next year, the group announced a second worldwide tour scheduled for 2017 and 2018 and later announced a short United Kingdom tour for 2020.\n\nJoining May, Taylor and Lambert are long-time Queen touring keyboardist [[Spike Edney]], bassist Neil Fairclough and percussionist Tyler Warren. Although there are currently no plans to release a studio album with this lineup, May and Taylor have stated that there is a possibility of the group recording original material.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ultimateclassicrock.com/queen-recording-adam-lambert/|title=Queen Hint at Recording New Material with Adam Lambert|work=Ultimate Classic Rock}}</ref>\n\n==Origin==\nQueen and Lambert first performed together in 2009 when Queen members Brian May and Roger Taylor appeared as guests on the [[American Idol (season 8)|eighth season of ''American Idol'']] on which Lambert was a contestant.

Although it was not actually shot in Modesto, the film portrayed the spirit of [[cruising (driving)|cruising]] and friendship on Modesto's 10th and 11th Streets in 1962, and inspired a revival of interest in 1950s pop culture, including the TV show ''[[Happy Days]]'' and its spin-offs.\n\nThe city's annual Architectural Festival honors Modesto's history as a testing ground for mid-century modern architecture during the 1940s and '50s. Modesto's mid-century buildings have been featured four times in Museum of Modern Art publications.\n\nThe Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index for 2011, which interviews 1,000 participants about their jobs, finances, physical health, emotional state of mind and communities, ranked Modesto 126 out of the 190 cities surveyed.<ref name=Gallup-Healthways>{{cite web|title=State of Well Being|url=http://www.well-beingindex.com/files/2012WBIrankings/CA_2011StateReport.pdf |publisher=Gallup-Healthways}}</ref> In December 2009, ''[[Forbes]]'' ranked Modesto 48th out of 100 among \"Best Bang-for-the-Buck Cities\".

When Modesto was founded in 1870, it was to be named Ralston after financier [[William C. Ralston]]. Ralston's modesty prompted him to ask that another name be found, and the town was named Modesto in recognition of his modesty.\n\nModesto's population was over 1,000 residents in 1884. With fields of grain, a nearby [[Tuolumne River]] for grain barges, and railroad traffic, the town grew. Irrigation water came from dams installed in the foothills, and irrigated fields of vegetables and fruit and nut trees flourished. By 1900, Modesto's population was over 4,500. During [[World War II]], the area provided canned goods, powdered milk, and eggs for the US [[Armed forces of the United States|armed forces]] and Allied forces. For the next few decades, Modesto's population grew about two percent per year to over 100,000 in 1980, and over 200,000 in 2001.\n\nThe city's official motto, \"Water Wealth Contentment Health,\" is emblazoned on the downtown [[Modesto Arch]], which is featured in local photographs and postcards. The motto was selected in a contest held in 1911, where the winner won $3 as his prize. (The original winner, \"Nobody's [[:wikt:get someone's goat|got Modesto's goat]]\",<ref>{{cite book|last=Hoover |first=Mildred Brooke|title=Historic Spots in California|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AYMPR6xAj50C&pg=PA521|year=2002|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=978-0-8047-7817-6|page=521}}</ref> was later declined by town officials.)

The McHenry family built the house in 1883 after the patriarch of the family, Oramil McHenry, left twenty thousand dollars in his will.<ref name=\":0\" /> The mansion was listed on the '''[[National Register of Historic Places]]''' (NRHP) in 1978.\n\n====Hawke Castle====\n{{main|Hawke Castle}}\nThe '''Hawke Castle''' is a historic residence built in 1929. It was influenced by the Norman architecture, and is now the property of George Thayer Real Estate.\n\n====Crow House====\nor the Walter B. Wood House, was originally located at 814 Twelfth Street. The house was originally owned by Walter Wood and was constructed in 1884 in the Italianate style. The house has been removed from its original location, and modern renovation of the house has compromised its '''NRHP''' designation.\n\n====Robert Walton House====\nThe '''Robert Walton House''' was constructed in 1957, as a development of Frank Lloyd Wright's New York Usonian Exhibition House concept.\n\n===Structures===\n\n====El Viejo Post Office====\nThe '''U. S. \"El Viejo\" Post Office''' is located on Twelfth and I Streets. Wall murals inside the post office were painted by [[Ray Boynton]], a Work Projects Administration artist. The post office was listed in the '''NRHP''' in 1983.\n\n====Dry Creek Bridge====\nThe '''Dry Creek Bridge''', formerly on State Route 132, was recommended eligible for its design. The bridge is a major example of John B. Leonard's bridge designs.\n\n====Southern Pacific Railroad Depot====\n{{main|Southern Pacific Railroad Depot (Modesto, California)}}\nThe '''Southern Pacific Railroad Depot''' was constructed in 1915 in the Mission style at the corner of J and Ninth Streets. The City of Modesto was established as a town by the Southern Pacific Railroad in 1870. The building has been restored and expanded as the City Transportation Center.\n\n==Transportation==\n[[File:Modesto California photo D Ramey Logan.jpg|thumb|375px|left| Aerial photo of City of Ceres, California]]\n\n===Rail===\nModesto is served by one of the busiest rail corridors in the country. The [[Amtrak]] ''[[San Joaquin (Amtrak)|San Joaquin]]'' makes eight daily stops on the route between [[Oakland, California|Oakland]] and [[Bakersfield]], and four stops daily on the route between [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]] and Bakersfield, at a [[Modesto station|station]] on the east edge of town.\n\n[[Altamont Corridor Express]] commuter rail is planned to recommence rail service to the Southern Pacific Railroad Depot in 2023.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Holland|first1=John|title=Expanded train service coming to Modesto, Merced; what it means for commuters|url=https://www.modbee.com/news/article209941964.html|accessdate=April 28, 2018|agency=Modesto Bee|date=April 27, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe large industrial region south and east of the city is served by the [[Modesto and Empire Traction Company]], a {{convert|5|mi|km|adj=on}} [[short-line railroad|short line]] railroad, with a web of industry tracks and many customers.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\nAt one time, Modesto was the operational center of the [[Tidewater Southern Railway]], which had its main line down the center of Ninth Street, a major north\u2013south street. A city [[local ordinance|ordinance]] passed by the city council kept [[electric power]] lines over this section of street activated long after the railroad had converted to steam power. In 2000, the last trains ran down Ninth Street. Now the railroad (owned by the [[Union Pacific Railroad]] since 1983) no longer passes through Modesto.\n\nModesto also is planned to be served by the future [[California High Speed Rail]].\n\n===Public transit===\nThree public transit systems serve Modesto: [[Modesto Area Express (MAX)]], [[Stanislaus Regional Transit|StaRT]], and the [[San Joaquin Regional Transit District]] along the northern edge of the city on McHenry Avenue. MAX is the local system with additional connections to the [[Altamont Corridor Express]] train station in [[Lathrop, California|Lathrop]] and the [[Dublin/Pleasanton (BART station)|Dublin/Pleasanton]] [[Bay Area Rapid Transit|BART]] station. MAX also provides a [[paratransit]] \"[[dial-a-ride]]\" service which specifically caters to seniors and the disabled. It is open to the general public only during certain times.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Modesto Area Express |url=http://www.modestoareaexpress.com/dar_information.htm |title=Dial-A-Ride Information}}</ref> StaRT connects Modesto to the county's other populated centers.\n\n===Air===\nModesto is served by the [[Modesto City-County Airport]] that lies east of [[California State Route 99]] within the city limits. [[SkyWest Airlines]] (operating as [[United Express]]) provided air service to [[San Francisco International Airport]], however commercial service stopped in June 2014.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.mantecabulletin.com/section/140/article/107180 |title=Modesto Airport passenger service ends Wednesday |accessdate=September 27, 2014 |date=June 2, 2014 |work=The Manteca Bulletin}}</ref> The airport is used for manufacturing and the shipping industries throughout California and the United States.\n\n===Highways and roads===\n[[Interstate 5]] and [[California State Route 99]] provide major highway access to Modesto.\n[[California State Route 132]] links the city to [[Interstate 580 (California)|Interstate 580]], providing commuter access to highways into the [[Bay Area]]. [[California State Route 108]] connects to [[Oakdale, California]] and east to the foothills. The city has added many roundabouts in an effort to ease traffic congestion within the town with varying degrees of success.\n\n== Geography ==\n\n=== Climate ===\nModesto has a semi-arid climate (''BSh'' in the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]]) It has mild winters with moderate rainfall and long, hot, dry summers. Average January temperatures range from 56&nbsp;\u00b0F (13&nbsp;\u00b0C) in the day to 40&nbsp;\u00b0F (4&nbsp;\u00b0C) at night. Most of the rainfall occurs during the winter and the annual total is 13.2&nbsp;inches (335&nbsp;mm). The city does not have a full storm sewer system, many streets flood during winter rain storms.\n\nAverage July temperatures range from 95&nbsp;\u00b0F (35&nbsp;\u00b0C) in the day to 63&nbsp;\u00b0F (17&nbsp;\u00b0C) at night. During the summer months there can be multiple days in a row with high temperatures exceeding 100&nbsp;\u00b0F (~38&nbsp;\u00b0C). This can pose health risks for people with weak constitutions or who ignore the dangers of heat stroke. Onshore breezes (locally known as the \"delta breeze\") moderate these high temperatures somewhat, with cooler air coming in after 8 or 9&nbsp;pm on summer nights.\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Modesto, California (1981\u20132010)\n|single line = Y\n|Jan record high F =  75\n|Feb record high F =  80\n|Mar record high F =  89\n|Apr record high F = 100\n|May record high F = 107\n|Jun record high F = 112\n|Jul record high F = 113\n|Aug record high F = 108\n|Sep record high F = 106\n|Oct record high F = 101\n|Nov record high F =  88\n|Dec record high F =  75\n|year record high F =113\n|Jan high F = 55.4\n|Feb high F = 62.8\n|Mar high F = 68.7\n|Apr high F = 74.7\n|May high F = 82.9\n|Jun high F = 89.9\n|Jul high F = 95.1\n|Aug high F = 93.6\n|Sep high F = 89.0\n|Oct high F = 79.0\n|Nov high F = 65.5\n|Dec high F = 55.6\n|year high F =76.0\n|Jan low F = 40.1\n|Feb low F = 43.2\n|Mar low F = 46.3\n|Apr low F = 49.3\n|May low F = 54.9\n|Jun low F = 59.8\n|Jul low F = 63.1\n|Aug low F = 62.3\n|Sep low F = 59.2\n|Oct low F = 52.6\n|Nov low F = 44.8\n|Dec low F = 39.8\n|year low F = 51.3\n|Jan record low F = 18\n|Feb record low F = 24\n|Mar record low F = 27\n|Apr record low F = 30\n|May record low F = 32\n|Jun record low F = 39\n|Jul record low F = 46\n|Aug record low F = 46\n|Sep record low F = 40\n|Oct record low F = 29\n|Nov record low F = 25\n|Dec record low F = 18\n|year record low F =18\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation inch = 2.61\n|Feb precipitation inch = 2.38\n|Mar precipitation inch = 2.04\n|Apr precipitation inch = 0.97\n|May precipitation inch = 0.63\n|Jun precipitation inch = 0.12\n|Jul precipitation inch = 0.00\n|Aug precipitation inch = 0.02\n|Sep precipitation inch = 0.26\n|Oct precipitation inch = 0.68\n|Nov precipitation inch = 1.36\n|Dec precipitation inch = 2.04\n|year precipitation inch=13.19\n|source 1 = NOAA<ref>[http://w2.weather.gov/climate/xmacis.php?wfo=sto NOWData \u2013 NOAA Online Weather Data] NOAA.

In Modesto there is also a small creek aptly named Dry Creek, which although badly polluted by agricultural runoff, is adjacent to several parks in Modesto. Most of the rivers and streams are otherwise not accessible to public use or view due to fences and private property rights. There are no public boat ramps or docks within the city limits. Although summertime brings high temperatures, swimming is prohibited by local ordinance in rivers, creeks, and the many irrigation canals. Rivers and lakes near [[Waterford, CA|Waterford]] are wide enough to be accessible for a [[kayak]], or small [[motorboat]], and there are several points of public access. This access was given as part of a government plan when [[hydroelectric power]] dams were installed upstream for valuable flood control, [[irrigation]], and [[electric power]] generation. The nearest large open [[seaport]] is the [[Port of Stockton]], used for oceangoing ships that transport goods, particularly cement, fertilizer, and agricultural products, from California to overseas.\n\n== Economy and infrastructure ==\n\n===Industry===\nModesto has a large agricultural industry which is based on the fertile farmland surrounding the city. Modesto is home to the largest winery in the world: [[E & J Gallo Winery]]. The Gallo Glass Company, a company of Gallo Winery, is the largest wine bottle manufacturing company in the world. The company provides thousands of office and manufacturing jobs to Stanislaus County residents. Other major privately owned companies based in Modesto include [[Foster Farms Dairy]], [[Royal Robbins]], international award winner Fiscalini Cheese, Sciabica Olive Oil, Acme Construction, Aderholt Specialty, and 511 Tactical (formerly a part of Royal Robbins, a United States brand of clothing consisting of [[uniform]]s and [[Military tactics|tactical]] equipment for military). A cannery downtown produces food which is usually shipped to [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]] and [[Fresno, California|Fresno]] for transfer to rail or ship. [[Ceres, California|Ceres]] has a few cereal and snack factories in the area.  There are several small steelworking companies in Modesto. In mid-2008, a number of road projects were being constructed, repaved or repaired, with an estimated total cost of nearly $120,000,000.\n\n===Principal employers===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! #\n!

The result was a comprehensive evaluation of alternative population and land use projections along with associated environmental impact analysis. Some of the environmental factors technically assessed were air quality, [[water quality]], [[environmental noise]], [[soil contamination]] and visual impacts.\n\nMuch of the soils in Modesto are classified as part of the Hanford series: (HbpA) fine [[sandy loam]], moderately deep over silt.<ref>{{cite book|author=Bureau of Soils|title=Soil survey of ...|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3-LwAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA81|year=1964|publisher=Dept. of Agriculture|page=81}}</ref> These soils are well-drained, moderately coarse-textured soils derived from [[alluvium]] from granitic rock. The Hanford soils are important for the production of a wide variety of irrigated orchard, field, and [[market garden|truck crops]].\n\nVicinity watercourses include the [[Stanislaus River]], the [[Tuolumne River]] and [[Dry Creek, Stanislaus County|Dry Creek]] empties into the Tuolumne River. Area groundwater, which is the principal source of water supply in the city,<ref>''Stanislaus County General Plan'' (1987)</ref> has been historically impaired in a fashion that is spatially variable. Water from the nearby Modesto Reservoir is now used to augment city water. In various parts of the city and its perimeter the following [[water pollutant]]s have occurred from time to time: [[nitrate]]s, [[dibromochloromethane]], [[Volatile Organic Compounds|volatile organics]], salinity, [[total dissolved solids]] and other [[pesticide]]s.<ref>John Torrey, Paul Awosika et al., ''Expanded initial study, Boulder Creek subdivision, Stanislaus County'', Earth Metrics, Report 7999: California State Clearinghouse, Sacramento, November 1989.</ref> Each of these contaminants is not present citywide.\n\nThe [[EPA]] rates air quality in Modesto as a 23 on a scale to 100 (higher is better), making Modesto an unhealthy place to live for those with breathing difficulties. This is based on ozone alert days and number of pollutants in the air. In May 2010, ''Forbes'' magazine, in association with the [[American Lung Association]], indicated that Modesto was one of the top 25 most polluted cities in the U.S.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/2010/04/28/polluted-cities-smog-lifestyle-health-american-lung-association-ozone_slide_2.html?partner=msnhealth |work=Forbes |title=List: Worst Cities For Ozone Pollution}}</ref>\n\n==Downtown revitalization==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2019}}\nAs of the 2000s, downtown Modesto (DOMO) has new attractions including the Gallo Center for the Arts and the new Downtown Plaza adjacent to Modesto Centre Plaza. Downtown Modesto has lost the Hotel Covell, the [[art deco]] Strand Theatre, and the Sears building.\n\nThe historic streets of 10th and 11th streets that were the original locations of the cruising featured in ''American Graffiti'' have been designated by the City of Modesto as the Historic Cruise Route. This is now a tourist walk with information about Modesto's music, car and Graffiti culture.\n\nIn 2014, the Walk of Fame was launched on the Historic Cruise Route with markers celebrating classic legends like George Lucas, [[Gene Winfield]] Bart Bartoni and others.\n\nClassic Community Murals was launched by Modesto magazine ModestoView and the Peer Recovery Art Center to create a series of large scale murals celebrating the Modesto Classic Graffiti heritage. Many of these are on the Cruise Route.\n\nNew business incentives have been created to enhance facades, signage, and permitting.  A promenade is being designed to create a special entertainment zone along the corridor between the Modesto Centre Plaza and the Gallo Center for the Arts and the adjacent core streets of 10th, 11th and J Streets.\n\n==Entertainment and culture==\nThe [[Modesto Nuts]] Minor League Baseball Club is a class A [[California League]]. The Nuts are the Single A affiliate of the [[Seattle Mariners]] and play 70 home games each season.\n\n[[Track and field]] competition includes the [[Modesto Relays]] named after meet director [[Tom Moore (track)|Tom Moore]] after his death. 30 [[List of world records in athletics|world records]] were set at the meet held at [[Modesto Junior College]].\n\nMusic festivals include SummerFest, the Downtown summer concert series, featuring [[Chris Isaak]], [[Hootie & the Blowfish]], [[The Doobie Brothers]] and [[Styx (band)|Styx]].\n\nX-Fest, deriving from its real name [[Xclamation Festival]], is a 21 and over music festival in downtown Modesto. Starting in 2000, X-Fest has evolved into a large outdoor event stretching 15 blocks and featuring the world's largest disco which covers four blocks on its own. In 2008 X-Fest featured 50 bands and a crowd of 15,000 people. Much of the profits end up in local non-profit charities. Some business owners and citizens of Modesto complain of rowdy and often drunk [[Mardi Gras]] atmosphere exhibited at X-fest. Events like these may have helped propel Modesto to be ranked, in Feb. 2010 by ''Men's Health'' magazine, as the 12th drunkest city in America, based on alcohol-related deaths, DUI and other arrests. The last X-fest occurred in Modesto in 2015.\n\nSummers are also marked by the revival of ''[[American Graffiti]]'', the 1973 film written and directed by Modesto native [[George Lucas]]. Lucas' film paid homage to teenage life in 1962 based on his own experiences growing up in the city of Modesto.

The [[farm-to-table]] movement plays a central role in Modesto living as in the Central Valley.\n\nFilmmaker [[George Lucas]], who was born in Modesto, graduated from [[Thomas Downey High School]] in 1962 and attended Modesto Junior College, immortalized the city in his award-winning 1973 film ''[[American Graffiti]]''. Although it was not actually shot in Modesto, the film portrayed the spirit of [[cruising (driving)|cruising]] and friendship on Modesto's 10th and 11th Streets in 1962, and inspired a revival of interest in 1950s pop culture, including the TV show ''[[Happy Days]]'' and its spin-offs.\n\nThe city's annual Architectural Festival honors Modesto's history as a testing ground for mid-century modern architecture during the 1940s and '50s. Modesto's mid-century buildings have been featured four times in Museum of Modern Art publications.\n\nThe Gallup-Healthways Well-Being Index for 2011, which interviews 1,000 participants about their jobs, finances, physical health, emotional state of mind and communities, ranked Modesto 126 out of the 190 cities surveyed.<ref name=Gallup-Healthways>{{cite web|title=State of Well Being|url=http://www.well-beingindex.com/files/2012WBIrankings/CA_2011StateReport.pdf |publisher=Gallup-Healthways}}</ref> In December 2009, ''[[Forbes]]'' ranked Modesto 48th out of 100 among \"Best Bang-for-the-Buck Cities\".

When Modesto was founded in 1870, it was to be named Ralston after financier [[William C. Ralston]]. Ralston's modesty prompted him to ask that another name be found, and the town was named Modesto in recognition of his modesty.\n\nModesto's population was over 1,000 residents in 1884. With fields of grain, a nearby [[Tuolumne River]] for grain barges, and railroad traffic, the town grew. Irrigation water came from dams installed in the foothills, and irrigated fields of vegetables and fruit and nut trees flourished. By 1900, Modesto's population was over 4,500. During [[World War II]], the area provided canned goods, powdered milk, and eggs for the US [[Armed forces of the United States|armed forces]] and Allied forces. For the next few decades, Modesto's population grew about two percent per year to over 100,000 in 1980, and over 200,000 in 2001.\n\nThe city's official motto, \"Water Wealth Contentment Health,\" is emblazoned on the downtown [[Modesto Arch]], which is featured in local photographs and postcards. The motto was selected in a contest held in 1911, where the winner won $3 as his prize. (The original winner, \"Nobody's [[:wikt:get someone's goat|got Modesto's goat]]\",<ref>{{cite book|last=Hoover |first=Mildred Brooke|title=Historic Spots in California|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AYMPR6xAj50C&pg=PA521|year=2002|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=978-0-8047-7817-6|page=521}}</ref> was later declined by town officials.)

The [[Amtrak]] ''[[San Joaquin (Amtrak)|San Joaquin]]'' makes eight daily stops on the route between [[Oakland, California|Oakland]] and [[Bakersfield]], and four stops daily on the route between [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]] and Bakersfield, at a [[Modesto station|station]] on the east edge of town.\n\n[[Altamont Corridor Express]] commuter rail is planned to recommence rail service to the Southern Pacific Railroad Depot in 2023.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Holland|first1=John|title=Expanded train service coming to Modesto, Merced; what it means for commuters|url=https://www.modbee.com/news/article209941964.html|accessdate=April 28, 2018|agency=Modesto Bee|date=April 27, 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe large industrial region south and east of the city is served by the [[Modesto and Empire Traction Company]], a {{convert|5|mi|km|adj=on}} [[short-line railroad|short line]] railroad, with a web of industry tracks and many customers.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}\n\nAt one time, Modesto was the operational center of the [[Tidewater Southern Railway]], which had its main line down the center of Ninth Street, a major north-south street. A city [[local ordinance|ordinance]] passed by the city council kept [[electric power]] lines over this section of street activated long after the railroad had converted to steam power. In 2000, the last trains ran down Ninth Street. Now the railroad (owned by the [[Union Pacific Railroad]] since 1983) no longer passes through Modesto.\n\nModesto also is planned to be served by the future [[California High Speed Rail]].\n\n===Public transit===\nThree public transit systems serve Modesto: [[Modesto Area Express (MAX)]], [[Stanislaus Regional Transit|StaRT]], and the [[San Joaquin Regional Transit District]] along the northern edge of the city on McHenry Avenue. MAX is the local system with additional connections to the [[Altamont Corridor Express]] train station in [[Lathrop, California|Lathrop]] and the [[Dublin/Pleasanton (BART station)|Dublin/Pleasanton]] [[Bay Area Rapid Transit|BART]] station. MAX also provides a [[paratransit]] \"[[dial-a-ride]]\" service which specifically caters to seniors and the disabled. It is open to the general public only during certain times.<ref>{{cite web|publisher=Modesto Area Express |url=http://www.modestoareaexpress.com/dar_information.htm |title=Dial-A-Ride Information}}</ref> StaRT connects Modesto to the county's other populated centers.\n\n===Air===\nModesto is served by the [[Modesto City-County Airport]] that lies east of [[California State Route 99]] within the city limits. [[SkyWest Airlines]] (operating as [[United Express]]) provided air service to [[San Francisco International Airport]], however commercial service stopped in June 2014.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.mantecabulletin.com/section/140/article/107180 |title=Modesto Airport passenger service ends Wednesday |accessdate=September 27, 2014 |date=June 2, 2014 |work=The Manteca Bulletin}}</ref> The airport is used for manufacturing and the shipping industries throughout California and the United States.\n\n===Highways and roads===\n[[Interstate 5]] and [[California State Route 99]] provide major highway access to Modesto.\n[[California State Route 132]] links the city to [[Interstate 580 (California)|Interstate 580]], providing commuter access to highways into the [[Bay Area]]. [[California State Route 108]] connects to [[Oakdale, California]] and east to the foothills. The city has added many roundabouts in an effort to ease traffic congestion within the town with varying degrees of success.\n\n== Geography ==\n\n=== Climate ===\nModesto has a semi-arid climate (''BSh'' in the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]]) It has mild winters with moderate rainfall and long, hot, dry summers. Average January temperatures range from 56&nbsp;\u00b0F (13&nbsp;\u00b0C) in the day to 40&nbsp;\u00b0F (4&nbsp;\u00b0C) at night. Most of the rainfall occurs during the winter and the annual total is 13.2&nbsp;inches (335&nbsp;mm). The city does not have a full storm sewer system, many streets flood during winter rain storms.\n\nAverage July temperatures range from 95&nbsp;\u00b0F (35&nbsp;\u00b0C) in the day to 63&nbsp;\u00b0F (17&nbsp;\u00b0C) at night. During the summer months there can be multiple days in a row with high temperatures exceeding 100&nbsp;\u00b0F (~38&nbsp;\u00b0C). This can pose health risks for people with weak constitutions or who ignore the dangers of heat stroke. Onshore breezes (locally known as the \"delta breeze\") moderate these high temperatures somewhat, with cooler air coming in after 8 or 9&nbsp;pm on summer nights.\n\n{{Weather box\n|location = Modesto, California (1981\u20132010)\n|single line = Y\n|Jan record high F =  75\n|Feb record high F =  80\n|Mar record high F =  89\n|Apr record high F = 100\n|May record high F = 107\n|Jun record high F = 112\n|Jul record high F = 113\n|Aug record high F = 108\n|Sep record high F = 106\n|Oct record high F = 101\n|Nov record high F =  88\n|Dec record high F =  75\n|year record high F =113\n|Jan high F = 55.4\n|Feb high F = 62.8\n|Mar high F = 68.7\n|Apr high F = 74.7\n|May high F = 82.9\n|Jun high F = 89.9\n|Jul high F = 95.1\n|Aug high F = 93.6\n|Sep high F = 89.0\n|Oct high F = 79.0\n|Nov high F = 65.5\n|Dec high F = 55.6\n|year high F =76.0\n|Jan low F = 40.1\n|Feb low F = 43.2\n|Mar low F = 46.3\n|Apr low F = 49.3\n|May low F = 54.9\n|Jun low F = 59.8\n|Jul low F = 63.1\n|Aug low F = 62.3\n|Sep low F = 59.2\n|Oct low F = 52.6\n|Nov low F = 44.8\n|Dec low F = 39.8\n|year low F = 51.3\n|Jan record low F = 18\n|Feb record low F = 24\n|Mar record low F = 27\n|Apr record low F = 30\n|May record low F = 32\n|Jun record low F = 39\n|Jul record low F = 46\n|Aug record low F = 46\n|Sep record low F = 40\n|Oct record low F = 29\n|Nov record low F = 25\n|Dec record low F = 18\n|year record low F =18\n|precipitation colour = green\n|Jan precipitation inch = 2.61\n|Feb precipitation inch = 2.38\n|Mar precipitation inch = 2.04\n|Apr precipitation inch = 0.97\n|May precipitation inch = 0.63\n|Jun precipitation inch = 0.12\n|Jul precipitation inch = 0.00\n|Aug precipitation inch = 0.02\n|Sep precipitation inch = 0.26\n|Oct precipitation inch = 0.68\n|Nov precipitation inch = 1.36\n|Dec precipitation inch = 2.04\n|year precipitation inch=13.19\n|source 1 = NOAA<ref>[http://w2.weather.gov/climate/xmacis.php?wfo=sto NOWData \u2013 NOAA Online Weather Data] NOAA.

In Modesto there is also a small creek aptly named Dry Creek, which although badly polluted by agricultural runoff, is adjacent to several parks in Modesto. Most of the rivers and streams are otherwise not accessible to public use or view due to fences and private property rights. There are no public boat ramps or docks within the city limits. Although summertime brings high temperatures, swimming is prohibited by local ordinance in rivers, creeks, and the many irrigation canals. Rivers and lakes near [[Waterford, CA|Waterford]] are wide enough to be accessible for a [[kayak]], or small [[motorboat]], and there are several points of public access. This access was given as part of a government plan when [[hydroelectric power]] dams were installed upstream for valuable flood control, [[irrigation]], and [[electric power]] generation. The nearest large open [[seaport]] is the [[Port of Stockton]], used for oceangoing ships that transport goods, particularly cement, fertilizer, and agricultural products, from California to overseas.\n\n== Economy and infrastructure ==\n\n===Industry===\nModesto has a large agricultural industry which is based on the fertile farmland surrounding the city. Modesto is home to the largest winery in the world: [[E & J Gallo Winery]]. The Gallo Glass Company, a company of Gallo Winery, is the largest wine bottle manufacturing company in the world. The company provides thousands of office and manufacturing jobs to Stanislaus County residents. Other major privately owned companies based in Modesto include [[Foster Farms Dairy]], [[Royal Robbins]], international award winner Fiscalini Cheese, Sciabica Olive Oil, Acme Construction, Aderholt Specialty, and 511 Tactical (formerly a part of Royal Robbins, a United States brand of clothing consisting of [[uniform]]s and [[Military tactics|tactical]] equipment for military). A cannery downtown produces food which is usually shipped to [[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]] and [[Fresno, California|Fresno]] for transfer to rail or ship. [[Ceres, California|Ceres]] has a few cereal and snack factories in the area.  There are several small steelworking companies in Modesto. In mid-2008, a number of road projects were being constructed, repaved or repaired, with an estimated total cost of nearly $120,000,000.\n\n===Principal employers===\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! #\n!

The result was a comprehensive evaluation of alternative population and land use projections along with associated environmental impact analysis. Some of the environmental factors technically assessed were air quality, [[water quality]], [[environmental noise]], [[soil contamination]] and visual impacts.\n\nMuch of the soils in Modesto are classified as part of the Hanford series: (HbpA) fine [[sandy loam]], moderately deep over silt.<ref>{{cite book|author=Bureau of Soils|title=Soil survey of ...|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3-LwAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA81|year=1964|publisher=Dept. of Agriculture|page=81}}</ref> These soils are well-drained, moderately coarse-textured soils derived from [[alluvium]] from granitic rock. The Hanford soils are important for the production of a wide variety of irrigated orchard, field, and [[market garden|truck crops]].\n\nVicinity watercourses include the [[Stanislaus River]], the [[Tuolumne River]] and [[Dry Creek, Stanislaus County|Dry Creek]] empties into the Tuolumne River. Area groundwater, which is the principal source of water supply in the city,<ref>''Stanislaus County General Plan'' (1987)</ref> has been historically impaired in a fashion that is spatially variable. Water from the nearby Modesto Reservoir is now used to augment city water. In various parts of the city and its perimeter the following [[water pollutant]]s have occurred from time to time: [[nitrate]]s, [[dibromochloromethane]], [[Volatile Organic Compounds|volatile organics]], salinity, [[total dissolved solids]] and other [[pesticide]]s.<ref>John Torrey, Paul Awosika et al., ''Expanded initial study, Boulder Creek subdivision, Stanislaus County'', Earth Metrics, Report 7999: California State Clearinghouse, Sacramento, November 1989.</ref> Each of these contaminants is not present citywide.\n\nThe [[EPA]] rates air quality in Modesto as a 23 on a scale to 100 (higher is better), making Modesto an unhealthy place to live for those with breathing difficulties. This is based on ozone alert days and number of pollutants in the air. In May 2010, ''Forbes'' magazine, in association with the [[American Lung Association]], indicated that Modesto was one of the top 25 most polluted cities in the U.S.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/2010/04/28/polluted-cities-smog-lifestyle-health-american-lung-association-ozone_slide_2.html?partner=msnhealth |work=Forbes |title=List: Worst Cities For Ozone Pollution}}</ref>\n\n==Downtown revitalization==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2019}}\nAs of the 2000s, downtown Modesto (DOMO) has new attractions including the Gallo Center for the Arts and the new Downtown Plaza adjacent to Modesto Centre Plaza. Downtown Modesto has lost the Hotel Covell, the [[art deco]] Strand Theatre, and the Sears building.\n\nThe historic streets of 10th and 11th streets that were the original locations of the cruising featured in ''American Graffiti'' have been designated by the City of Modesto as the Historic Cruise Route. This is now a tourist walk with information about Modesto's music, car and Graffiti culture.\n\nIn 2014, the Walk of Fame was launched on the Historic Cruise Route with markers celebrating classic legends like George Lucas, [[Gene Winfield]] Bart Bartoni and others.\n\nClassic Community Murals was launched by Modesto magazine ModestoView and the Peer Recovery Art Center to create a series of large scale murals celebrating the Modesto Classic Graffiti heritage. Many of these are on the Cruise Route.\n\nNew business incentives have been created to enhance facades, signage, and permitting.  A promenade is being designed to create a special entertainment zone along the corridor between the Modesto Centre Plaza and the Gallo Center for the Arts and the adjacent core streets of 10th, 11th and J Streets.\n\n==Entertainment and culture==\nThe [[Modesto Nuts]] Minor League Baseball Club is a class A [[California League]]. The Nuts are the Single A affiliate of the [[Seattle Mariners]] and play 70 home games each season.\n\n[[Track and field]] competition includes the [[Modesto Relays]] named after meet director [[Tom Moore (track)|Tom Moore]] after his death. 30 [[List of world records in athletics|world records]] were set at the meet held at [[Modesto Junior College]].\n\nMusic festivals include SummerFest, the Downtown summer concert series, featuring [[Chris Isaak]], [[Hootie & the Blowfish]], [[The Doobie Brothers]] and [[Styx (band)|Styx]].\n\nX-Fest, deriving from its real name [[Xclamation Festival]], is a 21 and over music festival in downtown Modesto. Starting in 2000, X-Fest has evolved into a large outdoor event stretching 15 blocks and featuring the world's largest disco which covers four blocks on its own. In 2008 X-Fest featured 50 bands and a crowd of 15,000 people. Much of the profits end up in local non-profit charities. Some business owners and citizens of Modesto complain of rowdy and often drunk [[Mardi Gras]] atmosphere exhibited at X-fest. Events like these may have helped propel Modesto to be ranked, in Feb. 2010 by ''Men's Health'' magazine, as the 12th drunkest city in America, based on alcohol-related deaths, DUI and other arrests. The last X-fest occurred in Modesto in 2015.\n\nSummers are also marked by the revival of ''[[American Graffiti]]'', the 1973 film written and directed by Modesto native [[George Lucas]]. Lucas' film paid homage to teenage life in 1962 based on his own experiences growing up in the city of Modesto. The city has realized the importance of its connection to the award-winning film, and the city is preparing new tourist attractions and events to welcome ''Graffiti'' tourists.  The Modesto Convention and Visitors bureau report that the leading request for information is ''American Graffiti''-related. The annual festival, Graffiti Summer, celebrates this event and lasts the entire month of June, attracting thousands of visitors and car enthusiasts along with hundreds of classic and [[antique cars]].\n\nDowntown Modesto has the Modesto Historic Cruise Route on 10th and 11th St, the Legends of the Cruise Walk of Fame, and the Classic Community Mural series of large scale art celebrating the American Graffiti history.  \n\nLocated in downtown Modesto is the State Theater with music acts and independent films.\n\nDowntown Modesto hosts a monthly Art Walk, with local artists displaying art for sale, artist demos, local gallery shows, in a multi-venue map self-guided tour.\n\n===Music and performing arts===\nThe [[Modesto Symphony Orchestra]], which finds its home at the Gallo Center, held their first performance when Modesto had a population of 17,000 in 1931 and continues to be a staple in the community.<ref>[http://www.modestosymphony.org/history.sj Modesto Symphony Official Web Site] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090405114442/http://www.modestosymphony.org/history.sj |date=April 5, 2009 }}</ref> Not to be outdone by the Symphony, MoBand (Modesto Band of Stanislaus County), established in 1919, is one of the oldest, continuously performing bands in the U.S.<ref>[http://www.modestoband.org/history.aspx MoBand Official Web Site] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090624144856/http://www.modestoband.org/history.aspx |date=June 24, 2009 }}</ref> The group performs a free 6-week summer concert-in-the-park series with its 130 volunteer musicians.\n\nModesto is also home to Townsend Opera, founded in 1983 by the late Modesto-born opera singer Buck Townsend, and Modesto Performing Arts, as well as the Gallo Center for the Arts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gallocenter.org |title=Gallo Center for the Arts}}</ref> Modesto is also home to the area's leading professional ballet company, Central West Ballet.\n\nThe Mexican culture and traditions are displayed by the Ballet Folklorico Group \"Casa Cultural Tradiciones\".
