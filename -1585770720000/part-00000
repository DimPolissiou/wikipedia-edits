The Second Great Awakening, which spread religion through revivals and emotional preaching, sparked a number of reform movements. Revivals were a key part of the movement and attracted hundreds of converts to new Protestant denominations. The Methodist Church used circuit riders to reach people in frontier locations. The Second Great Awakening led to a period of antebellum social reform and an emphasis on salvation by institutions. The outpouring of religious fervor and revival began in Kentucky and Tennessee in the 1790s and early 1800s among the Presbyterians, Methodists and Baptists. During the period, their American population was rapidly growing that the great leap westward characterized its territorial expansion. The awakening brought comfort in the face of uncertainty as a result of the socio-political changes in America.\n\nThis movement is typically regarded as less emotionally charged than the [[First Great Awakening]]. It led to the founding of several colleges, seminaries and mission societies. The Great Awakening notably altered the religious climate in the American colonies. Ordinary people were encouraged to make a personal connection with God, instead of relying on a minister. Newer denominations, such as Methodists and Baptists, grew quickly. While the movement unified the colonies and boosted church growth, experts say it also caused division among those who supported it and those who rejected it.\n\nHistorians named the Second Great Awakening in the context of the First Great Awakening of the 1730s and 1750s and of the [[Third Great Awakening]] of the late 1850s to early 1900s. The Second and Third Awakenings were part of a much larger Romantic religious movement that was sweeping across England, Scotland, and Germany.<ref>Christine Leigh Heyrman. \"[http://nationalhumanitiescenter.org/tserve/eighteen/ekeyinfo/grawaken.htm The First Great Awakening]\".

Each denomination had assets that allowed it to thrive on the frontier. The Methodists had an efficient organization that depended on itinerant ministers, known as \"[[Circuit rider (religious)|circuit riders]]\", who sought out people in remote frontier locations. The circuit riders came from among the common people, which helped them establish rapport with the frontier families they hoped to convert.\n\n===Theology===\n{{main|Postmillennialism}}\n[[Postmillennialist]] theology dominated American Protestantism in the first half of the 19th century. Postmillennialists believed that Christ will return to earth after the \"[[millennialism|Millennium]]\", which could entail either a literal 1,000 years or a figurative \"long period\" of peace and happiness. Christians thus had a duty to purify society in preparation for that return. This duty extended beyond American borders to include [[Christian Restorationism]]. George Fredrickson argues that Postmillennial theology \"was an impetus to the promotion of Progressive reforms, as historians have frequently pointed out.\"<ref name=\"Fredrickson\">George M.

These outdoor religious gatherings originated from field meetings and the [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[Presbyterian]]s' \"Holy Fairs\", which were brought to America in the mid-eighteenth century from [[Ireland]], [[Scotland]], and Britain's border counties. Most of the Scots-Irish immigrants before the [[American Revolutionary War]] settled in the backcountry of [[Pennsylvania]] and down the spine of the [[Appalachian Mountains]] in present-day [[Maryland]] and [[Virginia]], where Presbyterian emigrants and Baptists held large outdoor gatherings in the years prior to the war.

These often provided the first encounter for some settlers with organized religion, and they were important as social venues. The camp meeting was a religious service of several days' length with preachers. Settlers in thinly populated areas gathered at the camp meeting for fellowship as well as worship. The sheer exhilaration of participating in a religious revival with crowds of hundreds and perhaps thousands of people inspired the dancing, shouting, and singing associated with these events. The revivals also followed an arc of great emotional power, with an emphasis on the individual's sins and need to turn to Christ, and a sense of restoring personal salvation. This differed from the Calvinists' belief in predestination as outlined in the [[Westminster Confession of Faith]], which emphasized the inability of men to save themselves and decreed that the only way to be saved was by God's electing grace.<ref>{{cite web|author= |publisher=ushistory.org |title=Religious Transformation and the Second Great Awakening |work=U.S. History Online Textbook |url=http://www.ushistory.org/us/22c.asp |date=2018 |format=|accessdate=January 9, 2019}}</ref> Upon their return home, most converts joined or created small local churches, which grew rapidly.<ref>{{cite book | author =Dickson D.

The first informal camp meeting began in June, when people began camping on the grounds of the [[Red River Meeting House]]. Subsequent meetings followed at the nearby [[Gasper River|Gasper]] River and Muddy River congregations. All three of these congregations were under the ministry of James McGready. A year later, in August 1801, an even larger sacrament occasion that is generally considered to be America's first camp meeting was held at [[Cane Ridge, Kentucky|Cane Ridge]] in [[Bourbon County, Kentucky]], under [[Barton W. Stone]] (1772\u20131844) with numerous [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]], Baptist, and Methodist ministers participating in the services. The six-day gathering attracting perhaps as many as 20,000 people, although the exact number of attendees was not formally recorded. Due to the efforts of such leaders as Stone and [[Alexander Campbell (clergyman)|Alexander Campbell]] (1788\u20131866), the camp meeting revival spread religious enthusiasm and became a major mode of church expansion, especially for the Methodists and Baptists.<ref name=\"autogenerated2005\">Douglas Foster, et al., ''The Encyclopedia of the Stone-Campbell Movement'' (2005)</ref><ref name=Case3-4>{{cite book | author= Riley Case | title =Faith and Fury: Eli Farmer on the Frontier, 1794\u20131881 | publisher =Indiana Historical Society Press | series = | volume = | edition = | year =2018 | location =Indianapolis | pages =3 \u20134 | url = | isbn =9780871954299}}</ref> Presbyterians and Methodists initially worked together to host the early camp meetings, but the Presbyterians eventually became less involved because of the noise and often raucous activities that occurred during the protracted sessions.<ref name=Case3-4/>\n\nAs a result of the Revival of 1800, the [[Cumberland Presbyterian Church]] emerged in Kentucky and became a strong support of the revivalist movement.<ref>{{cite book | author=L.

Churches with roots in this movement include the [[Churches of Christ]], [[Christian Church (Disciples of Christ)]], and the [[Evangelical Christian Church in Canada]]. The congregations of these denomination were committed to individuals' achieving a personal relationship with Christ.<ref name=\"Sydney\"/>\n\n===Church membership soars===\n[[File:1839-meth.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.25|1839 Methodist camp meeting]]\nThe Methodist circuit riders and local Baptist preachers made enormous gains in increasing church membership. To a lesser extent the [[Presbyterians]] also gained members, particularly with the [[Cumberland Presbyterian Church]] in sparsely settled areas. As a result, the numerical strength of the Baptists and Methodists rose relative to that of the denominations dominant in the colonial period\u2014the Anglicans, Presbyterians, Congregationalists. Among the new denominations that grew from the religious ferment of the Second Great Awakening are the [[Churches of Christ]], [[Christian Church (Disciples of Christ)]], the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]], and the [[Evangelical Christian Church in Canada]].<ref name=\"Sydney\">Sydney E.

Converts were taught that to achieve salvation they needed not just to repent personal sin but also work for the moral perfection of society, which meant eradicating sin in all its forms. Thus, evangelical converts were leading figures in a variety of 19th century reform movements.<ref>Elizabeth J.Clapp, and Julie Roy Jeffrey, ed., Women, Dissent and Anti-slavery in Britain and America, 1790\u20131865, (Oxford; New York: Oxford University Press, 2011): 13\u201314</ref>\n\n[[Congregationalism in the United States|Congregationalists]] set up missionary societies to evangelize the western territory of the northern tier. Members of these groups acted as apostles for the faith, and also as educators and exponents of northeastern urban culture.

These organizations were primarily sponsored by affluent women. They did not stem entirely from the Second Great Awakening, but the revivalist doctrine and the expectation that one's conversion would lead to personal action accelerated the role of women's social benevolence work.{{sfnp|Lindley|1996|p=65}} Social activism influenced [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolition]] groups and supporters of the [[Temperance movement in the United States|Temperance movement]].

[[Richard Allen (bishop)|Richard Allen]], the other black attendee, was ordained by the Methodists in 1799, but his congregation of free African Americans in Philadelphia left the church there because of its discrimination. They founded the [[African Methodist Episcopal]] Church (AME) in Philadelphia. After first submitting to oversight by the established Methodist bishops, several AME congregations finally left to form the first independent African-American denomination in the United States in 1816. Soon after, the [[African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church]] (AME Zion) was founded as another denomination in New York City.\n\nEarly Baptist congregations were formed by slaves and free African Americans in South Carolina and Virginia. Especially in the Baptist Church, African Americans were welcomed as members and as preachers. By the early 19th century, independent African-American congregations numbered in the several hundreds in some cities of the South, such as [[Charleston, South Carolina]], and Richmond and [[Petersburg, Virginia]].<ref name = \"Raboteau\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=C3AQUK-6A2cC&pg=PA188 Albert J.

State legislatures{{which|date=October 2019}} passed laws requiring them always to have a white man present at their worship meetings.<ref name=\"Raboteau\" />\n\n==Women==\nWomen, who made up the majority of converts during the Awakening, played a crucial role in its development and focus. It is not clear why women converted in larger numbers than men. Various scholarly theories attribute the discrepancy to a reaction to the perceived sinfulness of youthful frivolity, an inherent greater sense of religiosity in women, a communal reaction to economic insecurity, or an assertion of the self in the face of patriarchal rule. Husbands, especially in the South, sometimes disapproved of their wives' conversion, forcing women to choose between submission to God or their spouses. Church membership and religious activity gave women peer support and place for meaningful activity outside the home, providing many women with communal identity and shared experiences.{{sfnp|Lindley|1996|pp=59\u201361}}\n\nDespite the predominance of women in the movement, they were not formally indoctrinated or given leading ministerial positions. However, women took other public roles; for example, relaying testimonials about their conversion experience, or assisting sinners (both male and female) through the conversion process. Leaders such as Charles Finney saw women's public prayer as a crucial aspect in preparing a community for revival and improving their efficacy in conversion.{{sfnp|Lindley|1996|pp=61\u201362}} Women also took crucial roles in the conversion and religious upbringing of children. During the period of revival, mothers were seen as the moral and spiritual foundation of the family, and were thus tasked with instructing children in matters of religion and ethics.{{sfnp|Ryan|1978|p=614}}\n\nThe greatest change in women's roles stemmed from participation in newly formalized missionary and reform societies. Women's prayer groups were an early and socially acceptable form of women's organization. In the 1830s, female moral reform societies rapidly spread across the North making it the first predominantly female social movement.<ref>\"Introduction\" in ''What Was the Appeal of Moral Reform to Antebellum Northern Women, 1835\u20131841?'', by Daniel Wright and Kathryn Kish Sklar.

In an effort to give sermons that would resonate with the congregation, ministers stressed Christ's humility and forgiveness, in what the historian Barbara Welter calls a \"feminization\" of Christianity.<ref>Barbara Welter, \"The Feminization of American Religion: 1800\u20131860,\" in ''Clio's Consciousness Raised'', edited by Mary S.

As a result, local churches saw their roles in society in purifying the world through the individuals to whom they could bring salvation, and through changes in the law and the creation of institutions. Interest in transforming the world was applied to mainstream political action, as temperance activists, antislavery advocates, and proponents of other variations of reform sought to implement their beliefs into national politics. While Protestant religion had previously played an important role on the American political scene, the Second Great Awakening strengthened the role it would play.<ref name=\"Timothy\" />\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Methodism|Calvinism|Latter Day Saint movement}}\n* [[Advent Christian Church]]\n* [[Christian revival]]\n* [[Christianity in the 19th century]]\n* [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]]\n* [[Cumberland Presbyterian Church]]\n* [[Ethnocultural politics in the United States]]\n* [[Holiness movement]]\n* [[Restoration Movement]]\n* [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Abzug, Robert H.

The Second Great Awakening, which spread religion through revivals and emotional preaching, sparked a number of reform movements. Revivals were a key part of the movement and attracted hundreds of converts to new Protestant denominations. The Methodist Church used circuit riders to reach people in frontier locations. The Second Great Awakening led to a period of antebellum social reform and an emphasis on salvation by institutions. The outpouring of religious fervor and revival began in Kentucky and Tennessee in the 1790s and early 1800s among the Presbyterians, Methodists and Baptists. During the period, their American population was rapidly growing that the great leap westward characterized its territorial expansion. The awakening brought comfort in the face of uncertainty as a result of the socio-political changes in America.\n\nThis movement is typically regarded as less emotionally charged than the [[First Great Awakening]]. It led to the founding of several colleges, seminaries and mission societies. The Great Awakening notably altered the religious climate in the American colonies. Ordinary people were encouraged to make a personal connection with God, instead of relying on a minister. Newer denominations, such as Methodists and Baptists, grew quickly. While the movement unified the colonies and boosted church growth, experts say it also caused division among those who supported it and those who rejected it.\n\nHistorians named the Second Great Awakening in the context of the First Great Awakening of the 1730s and 1750s and of the [[Third Great Awakening]] of the late 1850s to early 1900s. The Second and Third Awakenings were part of a much larger Romantic religious movement that was sweeping across England, Scotland, and Germany.<ref>Christine Leigh Heyrman. \"[http://nationalhumanitiescenter.org/tserve/eighteen/ekeyinfo/grawaken.htm The First Great Awakening]\".

Each denomination had assets that allowed it to thrive on the frontier. The Methodists had an efficient organization that depended on itinerant ministers, known as \"[[Circuit rider (religious)|circuit riders]]\", who sought out people in remote frontier locations. The circuit riders came from among the common people, which helped them establish rapport with the frontier families they hoped to convert.\n\n===Theology===\n{{main|Postmillennialism}}\n[[Postmillennialist]] theology dominated American Protestantism in the first half of the 19th century. Postmillennialists believed that Christ will return to earth after the \"[[millennialism|Millennium]]\", which could entail either a literal 1,000 years or a figurative \"long period\" of peace and happiness. Christians thus had a duty to purify society in preparation for that return. This duty extended beyond American borders to include [[Christian Restorationism]].

These often provided the first encounter for some settlers with organized religion, and they were important as social venues. The camp meeting was a religious service of several days' length with preachers. Settlers in thinly populated areas gathered at the camp meeting for fellowship as well as worship. The sheer exhilaration of participating in a religious revival with crowds of hundreds and perhaps thousands of people inspired the dancing, shouting, and singing associated with these events. The revivals also followed an arc of great emotional power, with an emphasis on the individual's sins and need to turn to Christ, and a sense of restoring personal salvation. This differed from the Calvinists' belief in predestination as outlined in the [[Westminster Confession of Faith]], which emphasized the inability of men to save themselves and decreed that the only way to be saved was by God's electing grace.<ref>{{cite web|author= |publisher=ushistory.org |title=Religious Transformation and the Second Great Awakening |work=U.S. History Online Textbook |url=http://www.ushistory.org/us/22c.asp |date=2018 |format=|accessdate=January 9, 2019}}</ref> Upon their return home, most converts joined or created small local churches, which grew rapidly.<ref>{{cite book | author =Dickson D.

These organizations were primarily sponsored by affluent women. They did not stem entirely from the Second Great Awakening, but the revivalist doctrine and the expectation that one's conversion would lead to personal action accelerated the role of women's social benevolence work.{{sfnp|Lindley|1996|p=65}} Social activism influenced [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolition]] groups and supporters of the [[Temperance movement in the United States|Temperance movement]].

Soon after, the [[African Methodist Episcopal Zion Church]] (AME Zion) was founded as another denomination in New York City.\n\nEarly Baptist congregations were formed by slaves and free African Americans in South Carolina and Virginia. Especially in the Baptist Church, African Americans were welcomed as members and as preachers. By the early 19th century, independent African-American congregations numbered in the several hundreds in some cities of the South, such as [[Charleston, South Carolina]], and Richmond and [[Petersburg, Virginia]].<ref name = \"Raboteau\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=C3AQUK-6A2cC&pg=PA188 Albert J.

It is not clear why women converted in larger numbers than men. Various scholarly theories attribute the discrepancy to a reaction to the perceived sinfulness of youthful frivolity, an inherent greater sense of religiosity in women, a communal reaction to economic insecurity, or an assertion of the self in the face of patriarchal rule. Husbands, especially in the South, sometimes disapproved of their wives' conversion, forcing women to choose between submission to God or their spouses. Church membership and religious activity gave women peer support and place for meaningful activity outside the home, providing many women with communal identity and shared experiences.{{sfnp|Lindley|1996|pp=59\u201361}}\n\nDespite the predominance of women in the movement, they were not formally indoctrinated or given leading ministerial positions. However, women took other public roles; for example, relaying testimonials about their conversion experience, or assisting sinners (both male and female) through the conversion process. Leaders such as Charles Finney saw women's public prayer as a crucial aspect in preparing a community for revival and improving their efficacy in conversion.{{sfnp|Lindley|1996|pp=61\u201362}} Women also took crucial roles in the conversion and religious upbringing of children. During the period of revival, mothers were seen as the moral and spiritual foundation of the family, and were thus tasked with instructing children in matters of religion and ethics.{{sfnp|Ryan|1978|p=614}}\n\nThe greatest change in women's roles stemmed from participation in newly formalized missionary and reform societies. Women's prayer groups were an early and socially acceptable form of women's organization. In the 1830s, female moral reform societies rapidly spread across the North making it the first predominantly female social movement.<ref>\"Introduction\" in ''What Was the Appeal of Moral Reform to Antebellum Northern Women, 1835\u20131841?'', by Daniel Wright and Kathryn Kish Sklar.

As a result, local churches saw their roles in society in purifying the world through the individuals to whom they could bring salvation, and through changes in the law and the creation of institutions. Interest in transforming the world was applied to mainstream political action, as temperance activists, antislavery advocates, and proponents of other variations of reform sought to implement their beliefs into national politics.

The interrelationship between photography and painting is a fundamental issue in contemporary Chinese art. This is because art during the post-Cultural Revolution era was dramatically affected by this interrelationship in many different ways, making it nearly impossible for photographers and oil painters to ignore. Other artists who were affected by this interrelationship and integrated it into their work included Chen Danqing, Hong Lei, Liu Zheng, Shi Chong, and Han Lei.<ref>Wu Hung, Making History: Contemporary Art</ref>\n\nLi was also heavily influenced by a book series known as the \"old photo craze\" (lao zhaopian re) published during [[contemporary China]]. The books were published by Shandong Pictorial Press, founded in 1994, and the first three issues became instant blockbusters in the mass book market. A total of three hundred thousand copies were printed of each of the three issues, and two hundred and forty thousand copies were printed for the fourth and final issue. These four issues were published within a single year from December 1996 to October 1997 and sold more than 1.2 million copies altogether. This made the series one of the most popular publications in post-Cultural Revolution China. This caused many artists, including Li, to become interested in representing history and memory during the post-Cultural Revolution era.<ref>Wu Hung, Making History: Contemporary Art</ref>\n\nThe use of photographs in artwork began in the early 80s with stressed and damaged photos from the Communist Revolution era. Then, during the mid to late 90s, artists used images to represent the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Sino-Japanese War]]. After this, experimental artists began using family photos to create \"private histories.\" This led to the use of contemporary art forms such as installation, video, and multi-media art. Since the 90's, there has been an effort to demonstrate photography's role in forging \"memory links\" between past and present. Some artists and photographers have gone from this to focusing more on the impermanence of the history and memory of the events displayed in the photographs.<ref>Wu Hung, Making History: Contemporary Art</ref>\n\nThese historic photos are familiar to millions of Chinese people. By incorporating photographs into artwork, artists are able to trigger the viewer's memory of the event being portrayed while simultaneously demonstrating their artistic talent and providing a new perspective.<ref>Wu Hung, Making History: Contemporary Art</ref>\n\nA documentary image can become \"a visual symbol, with a meaning extending far beyond the photograph's specific content.\" <ref>Wu Hung, Making History: Contemporary Art</ref>\n\n==Recent work==\nLi designed the poster for this year's (2012) [[Spoleto Festival USA]]. The festival involves musical and theatrical offerings. The poster, titled ''Beast'', was inspired by a photograph but was altered with Li's style of multiple layers of paint and sections. The work invites interpretation and was a unique choice for the show because the posters chosen in the past have traditionally been bold and brightly colored. The two abstract figures in the poster can be interpreted to be connected with the subject of the festival, as one of the opera productions \"Feng Yi Ting\" by Chinese composer Guo Wenging. The opera involves seduction and murder that ultimately saves an empire.<ref>[http://www.postandcourier.com/article/20120406/UNKNOWN/120409462&slId=5], Adam Parker, The Post and Courier, Friday, April 6, 2012, Spoleto Festival Unveils 'Subtle, Evocative' 2012 Poster</ref>\n\n==Exhibitions==\n===2011===\nLi's most recent exhibition was a solo exhibition at [[Pace Gallery]] in New York. It was Li's first U.S. solo show and included 11 large scale [[impasto]] oil paintings.<ref>[http://artasiapacific.com/Magazine/WebExclusives/RecentWorksLiSongsong], Irina Makarova, ArtAsiaPacific, Recent works, Li Songsong</ref>\n\n===2010===\n''Great Performances''\nThis exhibition provided a new perspective of contemporary Chinese art. Through various forms of art, including video, photography, installation, painting, etc., artists represented the uncertainty in the minds of the Chinese people over the rapid advancement and development of Chinese society. \"Role playing\", or the use of body language in art, became popular as the idea of self-identity began to develop further in China. Self-identity began to emerge in the 1990s. This is where the idea of performance art comes into play. Curator Leng Lin says, \"in such a compressed age, our 'performances' have been irrefutably passionate. 'Real' and 'surreal', it is a great performance.\" <ref>[http://www.artnet.com/artists/li%20songsong/], artnet, Li Songsong</ref>\n\nThis exhibition included his famous ''Pig Years'' painting (2010). This painting is 12 feet high completed with a variety of colors. It spans four separate panels, each with overlapping smaller panels, which are attached together by aluminum plates. The painting appears abstract up close, but comes together to reveal a pile of pigs when viewed from a distance.<ref>[http://artasiapacific.com/Magazine/WebExclusives/RecentWorksLiSongsong], Irina Makarova, ArtAsiaPacific, Recent works, Li Songsong</ref>\n\n===2009===\n''Abstract''\nThis was a solo exhibition at Pace Beijing. It included 16 paintings executed with Li's characteristic patchwork style and depicting dangerous situations involving planes. These include ''Peach Garden'' (2008), named after the Taipei Taoyuan (literally \"Peach Garden\"), showing a group of people crowded around an empty plane of a pilot who defected to Taiwan around the 1980s. A related piece, ''Betrayer'' (2008), depicts a pilot raising his hands in victory after landing. Finally, two other works, ''Oxygen Mask'' (2009) and ''Life Raft'' (2009), are both based on images taken from an airline safety brochure. These works collectively express the hidden dangers that come with the freedom of flight. ''Six Men'' (2008), depicting Japanese Kamikaze pilots, and ''Public Enemy'' (2008), loosely based on a newspaper photo of Yang Jia who allegedly killed several police officers after being accused and tortured over stealing a bicycle, were two other pieces included in the exhibit.\n\n''Red Storm'', Rijksmuseum Twenthe Museum voor oudeen moderne kunst, Enschede, Holland\n\n===2008===\n''Christian Dior & Chinese Artists'', Ullens Center for Contemporary Art, Beijing, China\n\n''The Revolution Continues'', Saatchi Gallery, London, UK\n\n''Encounters'', Pace Beijing, Beijing, China\n\n''New World Order'' \u2013 Contemporary Installation Art and Photography from China, Groningen Museum, Groningen, Holland\n\n''2D/3D Negotiating Visual Languages'', PKM Gallery, Beijing, China\n\n''Half-Life of a Dream'', Contemporary Chinese Art from the Logan Collection, San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, San Francisco, USA\n\n''Mahjong: Contemporary Chinese Art from the Sigg Collection'', The University of California, Berkeley Art Museum, Pacific Film Archive, Berkeley, USA\n\n===2007===\n''Altered, Stitched & Gathered'', P.S.1 Contemporary Art Center, New York\n\n''Mahjong - Chinesische Gegenwartskunst aus der Sammlung Sigg'', Museum der Moderne, Salzburg, Austria\n\n''Through the Painting'', 2nd Moscow Biennale, Moscow, Russia\n\n''Time Different - New Works from the Frank Cohen Collection'', Initial Access, Wolverhampton, Great Britain\n\n''Art from China - Collection Uli Sigg'', Centro Cultural Banco do Brazil, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\n\n===2006===\n''Hypnogenesis'', Galerie Urs Meile, Lucerne, Switzerland\n\n''Hypnogenesis'', Galerie Urs Meile, Beijing, China\n\n''CHINA NOW - Faszination einer Weltver\u00e4nderung'', Sammlung Essl, Klosterneuburg / Vienna, Austria\n\n''Mahjong - Chinesische Gegenwartskunst aus der Sammlung Sigg'', Hamburger Kunsthalle, Germany\n\n===2005===\n''PICTORIAL DNA made in China'', Galerie Urs Meile, Lucerne, Switzerland\n\n''Mahjong - Chinesische Gegenwartskunst aus der Sammlung Sigg'', Kunstmuseum Bern Switzerland\n\n''CHINA: as seen BY CONTEMPORARY CHINESE ARTISTS'', Spazio Oberdan, Milano, Italy\n\n===2004===\nReceived an honorable mention at the 4th China Contemporary Art Awards <ref>[http://www.artslant.com/global/artists/show/51819-li-songsong], ARTslanT, Li Songsong Biography</ref>\n\n''China's Photographic Painting'', China Art Season Gallery, Beijing\n\n''China und was mich sonst bewegt'', Galerie 99, Aschaffenburg\n\n''Solo exhibition'', Belgische Botschaft Beijing\n\n===2003===\n''Left Hand, Right Hand'', Deutsch-Chinesische Gemeinschaftsausstellung zeitgen\u00f6ssischer Kunst, 798 Space, Beijing\n3.\n\n''fade in'', Fotografie Ausstellung, 798 Art Space, Beijing\n\n===2002===\n''China Contempo'', Art Seasons Gallery, Singapore\n\n''Face to Face'', Chinese and Indian Contemporary Art, Shen Gallery, Singapore\n\n==See also==\n* [[P\u00e9kin Fine Arts]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\nImages, texts, biography and further information at the [http://www.saatchi-gallery.co.uk/artists/li_songsong.htm Saatchi Gallery]\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080915163551/http://www.88-mocca.org/#/artists/13#/artists/13 Li Songsong at 88MoCCA - The Museum of Chinese contemporary art on the web]\nImages of Li Songsong's work, biography and interview from [http://www.galerieursmeile.com/nav/top/artists/works/default.htm?view_ArtistItem_OID=50 Galerie Meile] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070816210610/http://www.galerieursmeile.com/nav/top/artists/works/default.htm?view_ArtistItem_OID=50 |date=16 August 2007 }}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Li, Songsong}}\n[[Category:Painters from Beijing]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:1973 births]]\n", "text_old": "'''Li Songsong''' (\u674e\u677e\u677e;

A total of three hundred thousand copies were printed of each of the three issues, and two hundred and forty thousand copies were printed for the fourth and final issue. These four issues were published within a single year from December 1996 to October 1997 and sold more than 1.2 million copies altogether. This made the series one of the most popular publications in post-Cultural Revolution China. This caused many artists, including Li, to become interested in representing history and memory during the post-Cultural Revolution era.<ref>Wu Hung, Making History: Contemporary Art</ref>\n\nThe use of photographs in artwork began in the early 80s with stressed and damaged photos from the Communist Revolution era. Then, during the mid to late 90s, artists used images to represent the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Sino-Japanese War]]. After this, experimental artists began using family photos to create \"private histories.\" This led to the use of contemporary art forms such as installation, video, and multi-media art. Since the 90's, there has been an effort to demonstrate photography's role in forging \"memory links\" between past and present. Some artists and photographers have gone from this to focusing more on the impermanence of the history and memory of the events displayed in the photographs.<ref>Wu Hung, Making History: Contemporary Art</ref>\n\nThese historic photos are familiar to millions of Chinese people. By incorporating photographs into artwork, artists are able to trigger the viewer's memory of the event being portrayed while simultaneously demonstrating their artistic talent and providing a new perspective.<ref>Wu Hung, Making History: Contemporary Art</ref>\n\nA documentary image can become \"a visual symbol, with a meaning extending far beyond the photograph's specific content.\" <ref>Wu Hung, Making History: Contemporary Art</ref>\n\n==Recent work==\nLi designed the poster for this year's (2012) [[Spoleto Festival USA]]. The festival involves musical and theatrical offerings. The poster, titled ''Beast'', was inspired by a photograph but was altered with Li's style of multiple layers of paint and sections. The work invites interpretation and was a unique choice for the show because the posters chosen in the past have traditionally been bold and brightly colored. The two abstract figures in the poster can be interpreted to be connected with the subject of the festival, as one of the opera productions \"Feng Yi Ting\" by Chinese composer Guo Wenging. The opera involves seduction and murder that ultimately saves an empire.<ref>[http://www.postandcourier.com/article/20120406/UNKNOWN/120409462&slId=5], Adam Parker, The Post and Courier, Friday, April 6, 2012, Spoleto Festival Unveils 'Subtle, Evocative' 2012 Poster</ref>\n\n==Exhibitions==\n===2011===\nLi's most recent exhibition was a solo exhibition at [[Pace Gallery]] in New York. It was Li's first U.S. solo show and included 11 large scale [[impasto]] oil paintings.<ref>[http://artasiapacific.com/Magazine/WebExclusives/RecentWorksLiSongsong], Irina Makarova, ArtAsiaPacific, Recent works, Li Songsong</ref>\n\n===2010===\n''Great Performances''\nThis exhibition provided a new perspective of contemporary Chinese art. Through various forms of art, including video, photography, installation, painting, etc., artists represented the uncertainty in the minds of the Chinese people over the rapid advancement and development of Chinese society. \"Role playing\", or the use of body language in art, became popular as the idea of self-identity began to develop further in China. Self-identity began to emerge in the 1990s. This is where the idea of performance art comes into play. Curator Leng Lin says, \"in such a compressed age, our 'performances' have been irrefutably passionate. 'Real' and 'surreal', it is a great performance.\" <ref>[http://www.artnet.com/artists/li%20songsong/], artnet, Li Songsong</ref>\n\nThis exhibition included his famous ''Pig Years'' painting (2010). This painting is 12 feet high completed with a variety of colors. It spans four separate panels, each with overlapping smaller panels, which are attached together by aluminum plates. The painting appears abstract up close, but comes together to reveal a pile of pigs when viewed from a distance.<ref>[http://artasiapacific.com/Magazine/WebExclusives/RecentWorksLiSongsong], Irina Makarova, ArtAsiaPacific, Recent works, Li Songsong</ref>\n\n===2009===\n''Abstract''\nThis was a solo exhibition at Pace Beijing. It included 16 paintings executed with Li's characteristic patchwork style and depicting dangerous situations involving planes. These include ''Peach Garden'' (2008), named after the Taipei Taoyuan (literally \"Peach Garden\"), showing a group of people crowded around an empty plane of a pilot who defected to Taiwan around the 1980s. A related piece, ''Betrayer'' (2008), depicts a pilot raising his hands in victory after landing. Finally, two other works, ''Oxygen Mask'' (2009) and ''Life Raft'' (2009), are both based on images taken from an airline safety brochure. These works collectively express the hidden dangers that come with the freedom of flight. ''Six Men'' (2008), depicting Japanese Kamikaze pilots, and ''Public Enemy'' (2008), loosely based on a newspaper photo of Yang Jia who allegedly killed several police officers after being accused and tortured over stealing a bicycle, were two other pieces included in the exhibit.\n\n''Red Storm'', Rijksmuseum Twenthe Museum voor oudeen moderne kunst, Enschede, Holland\n\n===2008===\n''Christian Dior & Chinese Artists'', Ullens Center for Contemporary Art, Beijing, China\n\n''The Revolution Continues'', Saatchi Gallery, London, UK\n\n''Encounters'', Pace Beijing, Beijing, China\n\n''New World Order'' \u2013 Contemporary Installation Art and Photography from China, Groningen Museum, Groningen, Holland\n\n''2D/3D Negotiating Visual Languages'', PKM Gallery, Beijing, China\n\n''Half-Life of a Dream'', Contemporary Chinese Art from the Logan Collection, San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, San Francisco, USA\n\n''Mahjong: Contemporary Chinese Art from the Sigg Collection'', The University of California, Berkeley Art Museum, Pacific Film Archive, Berkeley, USA\n\n===2007===\n''Altered, Stitched & Gathered'', P.S.1 Contemporary Art Center, New York\n\n''Mahjong - Chinesische Gegenwartskunst aus der Sammlung Sigg'', Museum der Moderne, Salzburg, Austria\n\n''Through the Painting'', 2nd Moscow Biennale, Moscow, Russia\n\n''Time Different - New Works from the Frank Cohen Collection'', Initial Access, Wolverhampton, Great Britain\n\n''Art from China - Collection Uli Sigg'', Centro Cultural Banco do Brazil, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil\n\n===2006===\n''Hypnogenesis'', Galerie Urs Meile, Lucerne, Switzerland\n\n''Hypnogenesis'', Galerie Urs Meile, Beijing, China\n\n''CHINA NOW - Faszination einer Weltver\u00e4nderung'', Sammlung Essl, Klosterneuburg / Vienna, Austria\n\n''Mahjong - Chinesische Gegenwartskunst aus der Sammlung Sigg'', Hamburger Kunsthalle, Germany\n\n===2005===\n''PICTORIAL DNA made in China'', Galerie Urs Meile, Lucerne, Switzerland\n\n''Mahjong - Chinesische Gegenwartskunst aus der Sammlung Sigg'', Kunstmuseum Bern Switzerland\n\n''CHINA: as seen BY CONTEMPORARY CHINESE ARTISTS'', Spazio Oberdan, Milano, Italy\n\n===2004===\nReceived an honorable mention at the 4th China Contemporary Art Awards <ref>[http://www.artslant.com/global/artists/show/51819-li-songsong], ARTslanT, Li Songsong Biography</ref>\n\n''China's Photographic Painting'', China Art Season Gallery, Beijing\n\n''China und was mich sonst bewegt'', Galerie 99, Aschaffenburg\n\n''Solo exhibition'', Belgische Botschaft Beijing\n\n===2003===\n''Left Hand, Right Hand'', Deutsch-Chinesische Gemeinschaftsausstellung zeitgen\u00f6ssischer Kunst, 798 Space, Beijing\n3.\n\n''fade in'', Fotografie Ausstellung, 798 Art Space, Beijing\n\n===2002===\n''China Contempo'', Art Seasons Gallery, Singapore\n\n''Face to Face'', Chinese and Indian Contemporary Art, Shen Gallery, Singapore\n\n==See also==\n* [[P\u00e9kin Fine Arts]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\nImages, texts, biography and further information at the [http://www.saatchi-gallery.co.uk/artists/li_songsong.htm Saatchi Gallery]\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20080915163551/http://www.88-mocca.org/#/artists/13#/artists/13 Li Songsong at 88MoCCA - The Museum of Chinese contemporary art on the web]\nImages of Li Songsong's work, biography and interview from [http://www.galerieursmeile.com/nav/top/artists/works/default.htm?view_ArtistItem_OID=50 Galerie Meile] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070816210610/http://www.galerieursmeile.com/nav/top/artists/works/default.htm?view_ArtistItem_OID=50 |date=16 August 2007 }}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Li, Songsong}}\n[[Category:Painters from Beijing]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:1973 births]]\n", "name_user": "Bellowhead678", "label": "safe", "comment": "Artsistic->Artistic -Fix a typo in one click", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Li_Songsong"}

These include subordinate greenish-grey, fine-grained [[sandstone]]s which are normally observed in fining upward cycles. The [[sandstone]]s vary in thickness from several metres to several tens of metres in some localities. [[Siltstone]]s are also found [[Interbedding|interbedded]] with the [[mudstone]] beds. The presence of these rocks reveal much about the past environment that they were deposited in. They were formed by [[sediment]]ary material being deposited in the [[Karoo Supergroup|Karoo Basin]] - a [[Back-arc region|retro-arc]] [[foreland basin]] - by vast, low-energy [[alluvial plain]]s flowing northwards from the south. The lowermost deposits are considered to be [[River delta|deltaic]] and grade laterally into the underlying [[Ecca Group]] deposits in its southern localities.
