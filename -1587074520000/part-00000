It can read and write over 200 [[image file formats]].\n\n==History==\nImageMagick was created in 1987 by John Cristy when working at [[DuPont]], to convert 24-bit images (16 million colors) to 8-bit images (256 colors), so they could be displayed on most screens. It was freely released in 1990 when DuPont agreed to transfer copyright to ''ImageMagick Studio LLC'', still currently the project maintainer organization.<ref name=\"history\" />\n\nIn May 2016, it was reported that ImageMagick had a vulnerability through which an attacker can execute arbitrary code on servers that use the application to edit user-uploaded images.<ref name=\"exploits-ars-technica\" /> Security experts including CloudFlare researchers observed actual use of the vulnerability in active hacking attempts.<ref name=\"exploits-cloudflare\" /> The security flaw was due to ImageMagick calling backend tools without first properly checking to ensure path and file names are free of improper shell commands.<ref name=\"exploits-register\" /> The vulnerability did not affect ImageMagick distributions that included a properly configured [[security policy]].\n\n==Features and capabilities==\nThe software mainly consists of a number of [[command-line interface]] utilities for manipulating images. ImageMagick does not have a robust [[graphical user interface]] to edit images as do [[Adobe Photoshop]] and [[GIMP]], but does include \u2013 for [[Unix-like]] [[operating system]]s \u2013 a basic native [[X Window]] [[graphical user interface|GUI]] (called IMDisplay) for rendering and manipulating images and [[Application programming interface|API]] libraries for many programming languages.\n\nExecute the following on Linux or UNIX to launch the GUI:<ref name=\"native-gui\" />\n\n:<code>$ display</code>\n\nOtherwise, images may be edited directly by various command-line parameters without launching a GUI at all. The program uses [[magic number (programming)|magic numbers]] to identify image [[file format]]s.\n\nFor a full list of supported formats, execute, on Linux or UNIX:\n\n:<code>$ identify -list format</code>\n\nA number of programs, such as [[Drupal]], [[MediaWiki]], [[phpBB]], and [[vBulletin]], can use ImageMagick to create image [[thumbnail]]s if installed. ImageMagick is also used by other programs, such as [[LyX]], for converting images.\n\nImageMagick has a fully integrated [[Perl]] [[Language binding|binding]] called PerlMagick,<ref name=\"perl-magick\" /> as well as many others: G2F (Ada), MagickCore (C), MagickWand (C), ChMagick (Ch), ImageMagickObject (COM+), Magick++ (C++), JMagick (Java), L-Magick (Lisp), NMagick (Neko/Haxe), MagickNet (.NET), PascalMagick (Pascal), MagickWand for PHP (PHP), IMagick (PHP), PythonMagick (Python), RMagick (Ruby), or TclMagick (Tcl/TK).\n\n===File format conversion===\nOne of the basic and thoroughly-implemented features of ImageMagick is its ability to efficiently and accurately convert images between different file formats (it uses the command <code>convert</code> to achieve this).\n\n===Color quantization===\nThe number of colors in an image can be reduced to an arbitrary number and this is done by weighing the most prominent color values present among the pixels of the image.\n\nA related capability is the [[posterization]] artistic effect, which also reduces the number of colors represented in an image. The difference between this and standard color quantization is that while in standard quantization the final palette is selected based upon a weighting of the prominence of existing colors in the image, posterization creates a palette of colors smoothly distributed across the spectrum represented in the image. Whereas with standard color quantization all of the final color values are ones that were in the original image, the color values in a posterized image may not have been present in the original image but are in between the original color values.\n\n===Dithering===\nA fine control is provided for the [[dither#Digital photography and image processing|dithering]] that occurs during color and shading alterations, including the ability to generate [[halftone]] dithering.\n\n===Liquid rescaling===\nIn 2008, support for [[seam carving|liquid rescaling]] was added.<ref name=\"changelog\" /> This feature allows, for example, [[aspect ratio (image)|rescaling]] 4:3 images into 16:9 images without distorting the image.\n\n===Artistic effects===\nImageMagick includes a variety of filters and features intended to create artistic effects:\n* Charcoal sketch transform\n* [[Posterization]]\n\n===OpenCL===\nImageMagick can use [[OpenCL]] to use an accelerated graphics card ([[GPU]]) for processing.<ref name=\"architecture\" />\n\n===Deep color===\nThe Q8 version supports up-to 8 bits-per-pixel component (8-bit grayscale, 24- or 32-bit RGB color). The Q16 version supports up-to 16 bits-per-pixel component (16-bit grayscale, up-to 48- or 64-bit RGB color).\n\n===Other===\nBelow are some other features of ImageMagick:\n* [[Data conversion|Format conversion]]: convert an image from one format to another (e.g. [[portable Network Graphics|PNG]] to [[JPEG]]).\n* Transform: resize, rotate, crop, flip or trim an image. (Applies these without [[generation loss]] on JPEG files, where possible.)\n* Transparency: render portions of an image invisible.\n* Draw: add shapes or text to an image.\n* Decorate: add a border or frame to an image.\n* Special effects: blur, sharpen, threshold, or tint an image.\n* Animation: assemble a [[Graphics Interchange Format|GIF]] animation file from a sequence of images.\n* Text & comments: insert descriptive or artistic text in an image.\n* Image identification: describe the format and attributes of an image.\n* Composite: overlap one image over another.\n* Montage: juxtapose image thumbnails on an image canvas.\n* Generalized pixel distortion: correct for, or induce image distortions including perspective.\n* Morphology of shapes: extract features, describe shapes and recognize patterns in images.\n* Motion picture support: read and write the common image formats used in digital film work.\n* Image calculator: apply a mathematical expression to an image or image channels.\n* [[Discrete Fourier transform]]: implements forward and inverse DFT.\n* Color management: accurate color management with color profiles or in lieu of \u2013 built-in [[gamma compression]] or expansion as demanded by the colorspace.\n* High-dynamic-range images: accurately represent the wide range of intensity levels found in real scenes ranging from the brightest direct sunlight to the deepest darkest shadows.\n* Encipher or decipher an image: convert ordinary images into unintelligible gibberish and back again.\n* Virtual pixel support: convenient access to pixels outside the image region.\n* Large image support: read, process, or write mega-, giga-, or tera-pixel image sizes.\n* Threads of execution support: ImageMagick is [[thread safe]] and most internal algorithms execute in parallel to take advantage of speed-ups offered by [[multi-core processor]] chips.\n* Heterogeneous distributed processing: certain algorithms are OpenCL-enabled to take advantage of speed-ups offered by executing in concert across heterogeneous platforms consisting of CPUs, GPUs, and other processors.\n* Distributed pixel cache: offload intermediate pixel storage to one or more remote servers.\n* ImageMagick on the [[iPhone]]: convert, edit, or compose images on your iOS computing device such as the iPhone or [[iPad]].\n\n==Distribution==\nImageMagick is [[cross-platform]], and runs on [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[Unix-like]] systems including [[Linux]], [[macOS]], [[iOS]], [[Android (operating system)|Android]], [[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]], and [[FreeBSD]]. The project's [[source code]] can be compiled for other systems, including [[AmigaOS 4|AmigaOS 4.0]] and [[MorphOS]]. It has been run under [[IRIX]].<ref name=\"api-install\" />\n\n==Related software==\n[[GraphicsMagick]] is a [[fork (software development)|fork]] of ImageMagick 5.5.2 made in 2002, emphasizing the cross-release stability of the programming [[application programming interface|API]] and command-line options. GraphicsMagick emerged as a result of irreconcilable differences in the developers' group.<ref name=\"mailing-list\" />\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Free and open-source software}}\n\n* [[DevIL]]\n* [[GD Graphics Library]]\n* [[Netpbm]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"history-quote\">{{cite web|url=https://www.imagemagick.org/script/history.php|title=History|website=ImageMagick|quote=...Dr. Pensak had to convince upper management at DuPont....Either way, ImageMagick would not be available today without DuPont transferring the copyright to ImageMagick Studio LLC.
