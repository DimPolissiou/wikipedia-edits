In the earliest Sumerian writings about them, which come from the Post-Akkadian period, the Anunnaki are the most powerful deities in the [[Pantheon (religion)|pantheon]], descendants of [[Anu|An]] and [[Ki (goddess)|Ki]], the god of the heavens and the goddess of earth, and their primary function is to [[Time and fate deities|decree the fate of Sumerians]].\n\nIn ''[[Inanna#Descent into the Underworld|Inanna's Descent into the Netherworld]]'', the Anunnaki are portrayed as seven judges who sit before the throne of [[Ereshkigal]] in the [[Ancient Mesopotamian Underworld|Underworld]]. Later Akkadian texts, such as the ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'', follow this portrayal. During the Old Babylonian period, the Anunnaki were believed to be the [[chthonic]] deities of the Underworld, while the gods of the heavens were known as the [[Igigi]]. The ancient [[Hittites]] identified the Anunnaki as the oldest generation of gods, who had been overthrown and banished to the Underworld by the younger gods. The Anunnaki have featured prominently in modern [[pseudoarchaeology|pseudoarchaeological]] works, such as the books of [[Zecharia Sitchin]].\n\n==Etymology==\n[[File:Mesopotamian - Cylinder Seal - Walters 42564 - Impression.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|[[Akkadian Empire|Akkad]]ian [[cylinder seal]] impression depicting a [[vegetation goddess]], possibly [[Ninhursag]], sitting on a throne surrounded by worshippers ({{circa|2350\u20132150}} BC)]]\n\nThe name ''Anunnaki'' is derived from [[Anu|An]],{{sfn|Leemings|2009|page=21}} the Sumerian god of the sky.{{sfn|Leemings|2009|page=21}} The name is variously written \"<sup>''[[determinative|d]]''</sup>a-nuna\", \"<sup>''d''</sup>a-nuna-ke<sub>4</sub>-ne\", or \"<sup>''d''</sup>a-nun-na\", meaning \"princely offspring\" or \"offspring of An\".{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=34}}\n\nThe Anunnaki were believed to be the offspring of [[Anu|An]] and his consort, the earth goddess [[Ki (goddess)|Ki]].{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=34}} [[Samuel Noah Kramer]] identifies Ki with the Sumerian mother goddess [[Ninhursag]], stating that they were originally the same figure.{{sfn|Kramer|1961|page=41}}{{sfn|Kramer|1963|page=122}} The oldest of the Anunnaki was [[Enlil]], the god of air{{sfn|Coleman|Davidson|2015|page=108}} and chief god of the Sumerian pantheon.{{sfn|Kramer|1983|pages=115\u2013121}} The Sumerians believed that, until Enlil was born, heaven and earth were inseparable.{{sfn|Kramer|1961|pages=72\u201373}} Then, Enlil cleaved heaven and earth in two{{sfn|Kramer|1961|pages=72\u201373}} and carried away the earth{{sfn|Kramer|1961|pages=72\u201375}} while his father An carried away the sky.{{sfn|Kramer|1961|pages=72\u201375}}\n\n==Worship and iconography==\nThe Anunnaki are chiefly mentioned in literary texts{{sfn|Leick|1998|page=8}} and very little evidence to support the existence of any cult of them has yet been unearthed.{{sfn|Leick|1998|page=8}}{{sfn|Falkenstein|1965|pages=127\u2013140}} This is likely due to the fact that each member of the Anunnaki had his or her own individual cult, separate from the others.{{sfn|Brisch|2016}} Similarly, no representations of the Anunnaki as a group have yet been discovered,{{sfn|Brisch|2016}} although a few depictions of its individual members have been identified.{{sfn|Brisch|2016}} Deities in ancient Mesopotamia were almost exclusively [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]].{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=93}} They were thought to possess extraordinary powers{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=93}} and were often envisioned as being of tremendous physical size.{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=93}} The deities typically wore ''melam'', an ambiguous substance which \"covered them in terrifying splendor\".{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|pages=93\u201394}} ''Melam'' could also be worn by heroes, kings, giants, and even demons.{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|pages=130\u2013131}} The effect that seeing a deity's ''melam'' has on a human is described as ''ni'', a word for the [[Paresthesia|physical tingling of the flesh]].{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=130}} Deities were almost always depicted wearing horned caps,{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=98}}{{sfn|Nemet-Nejat|1998|page=185}} consisting of up to seven superimposed pairs of ox-horns.{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=102}} They were also sometimes depicted wearing clothes with elaborate decorative gold and silver ornaments sewn into them.{{sfn|Nemet-Nejat|1998|page=185}}\n\nThe ancient Mesopotamians believed that their deities lived in [[Sumerian religion#Heaven|Heaven]],{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=94}} but that a god's statue was a physical embodiment of the god himself.{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=94}}{{sfn|Nemet-Nejat|1998|page=186}} As such, [[Cult image|cult statues]] were given constant care and attention{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=94}}{{sfn|Nemet-Nejat|1998|pages=186\u2013187}} and a set of priests were assigned to tend to them.{{sfn|Nemet-Nejat|1998|pages=186\u2013188}} These priests would clothe the statues{{sfn|Nemet-Nejat|1998|page=186}} and place feasts before them so they could \"eat\".{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=94}}{{sfn|Nemet-Nejat|1998|pages=186\u2013187}} A deity's [[Temple#Mesopotamian temples|temple]] was believed to be that deity's literal place of residence.{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=174}} The gods had boats, full-sized [[barge]]s which were normally stored inside their temples{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|pages=44\u201345}} and were used to transport their cult statues along waterways during various [[religious festival]]s.{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|pages=44\u201345}} The gods also had [[Chariot#Ancient Near East|chariots]], which were used for transporting their cult statues by land.{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=52}} Sometimes a deity's cult statue would be transported to the location of a battle so that the deity could watch the battle unfold.{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=52}} The major deities of the Mesopotamian pantheon, which included the Anunnaki, were believed to participate in the \"assembly of the gods\",{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=98}} through which the gods made all of their decisions.{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=98}} This assembly was seen as a divine counterpart to the [[History of democracy#Mesopotamia|semi-democratic legislative system]] that existed during the [[Third Dynasty of Ur]] ({{circa}} 2112 BC \u2014 {{circa}} 2004 BC).{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=98}}\n\n==Mythology==\n===Sumerian===\n[[File:Ea (Babilonian) - EnKi (Sumerian).jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Akkadian cylinder seal dating to {{circa|2300}} BC depicting the deities Inanna, Utu, and Enki, three members of the Anunnaki]]\n\nThe earliest known usages of the term ''Anunnaki'' come from inscriptions written during the reign of [[Gudea]] ({{circa}} 2144 \u2014 2124 BC) and the Third Dynasty of Ur. {{sfn|Leick|1998|page=8}}{{sfn|Brisch|2016}} In the earliest texts, the term is applied to the most powerful and important deities in the Sumerian pantheon: the descendants of the sky-god An.{{sfn|Leick|1998|page=8}}{{sfn|Katz|2003|page=403}}This group of deities probably included the \"seven gods who decree\":{{sfn|Kramer|1963|page=123}} An, Enlil, [[Enki]], [[Ninhursag]], [[Sin (mythology)|Nanna]], [[Utu]], and [[Inanna]].{{sfn|Kramer|1963|pages=122\u2013123}}\n\nAlthough certain deities are described as members of the Anunnaki, no complete list of the names of all the Anunnaki has survived{{sfn|Brisch|2016}} and they are usually only referred to as a cohesive group in literary texts.{{sfn|Leick|1998|page=8}}{{sfn|Brisch|2016}} Furthermore, Sumerian texts describe the Anunnaki inconsistently{{sfn|Brisch|2016}} and do not agree on how many Anunnaki there were, or what their divine function was.{{sfn|Leick|1998|page=8}}{{sfn|Brisch|2016}} Originally, the Anunnaki appear to have been heavenly deities with immense powers.{{sfn|Brisch|2016}} In the poem ''Enki and the World Order'', the Anunnaki \"do homage\" to Enki, sing hymns of praise in his honor, and \"take up their dwellings\" among the people of Sumer.{{sfn|Leick|1998|page=8}}{{sfn|Kramer|1963|page=180}} The same composition twice states that the Anunnaki \"decree the fates of mankind\".{{sfn|Leick|1998|page=8}}\n\nVirtually every major deity in the Sumerian pantheon was regarded as the patron of a specific city{{sfn|Nemet-Nejat|1998|page=179}} and was expected to protect that city's interests.{{sfn|Nemet-Nejat|1998|page=179}} The deity was believed to permanently reside within that city's temple.{{sfn|Nemet-Nejat|1998|page=187-189}} One text mentions as many as fifty Anunnaki associated with the city of [[Eridu]].{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=34}}{{sfn|Edzard|1965|pages=17\u2013140}} In ''[[Inanna#Descent into the Underworld|Inanna's Descent into the Netherworld]]'', there are only seven Anunnaki, who reside within the [[Kur|Underworld]] and serve as judges.{{sfn|Leick|1998|page=8}}{{sfn|Wolkstein|Kramer|1983|page=60}} [[Inanna]] stands trial before them for her attempt to take over the Underworld;{{sfn|Leick|1998|page=8}}{{sfn|Wolkstein|Kramer|1983|page=60}} they deem her guilty of [[hubris]] and condemn her to death.{{sfn|Wolkstein|Kramer|1983|page=60}}\n\nMajor deities in Sumerian mythology were associated with specific celestial bodies.{{sfn|Nemet-Nejat|1998|pages=201\u2013203}} Inanna was believed to be the planet [[Venus]].{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|pages=108\u2013109}}{{sfn|Nemet-Nejat|1998|page=203}} Utu was believed to be the sun.{{sfn|Nemet-Nejat|1998|page=203}}{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|pages=182\u2013184}} Nanna was the moon.{{sfn|Nemet-Nejat|1998|page=203}}{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=135}} An was identified with all the stars of the [[Celestial equator|equatorial sky]], Enlil with those of the [[Northern celestial hemisphere|northern sky]], and Enki with those of the [[Southern Celestial Hemisphere|southern sky]].{{sfn|Rogers|1998|page=13}} The path of Enlil's celestial orbit was a continuous, symmetrical circle around the [[Celestial pole|north celestial pole]],{{sfn|Levenda|2008|page=29}} but those of An and Enki were believed to intersect at various points.{{sfn|Levenda|2008|pages=29\u201330}}\n\n===Akkadian, Babylonian, and Assyrian===\n{{rquote|right|Reverence begets favour, sacrifice prolongs

In [[Inanna#Akkadian version|an abbreviated Akkadian version of ''Inanna's Descent'']] written in the early second millennium, [[Ereshkigal]], the queen of the Underworld, comments that she \"drink[s] water with the Anunnaki\".{{sfn|Dalley|1989|page=156}} Later in the same poem, Ereshkigal orders her servant [[Namtar]] to fetch the Anunnaki from Egalgina,{{sfn|Dalley|1989|page=159}} to \"decorate the threshold steps with coral\",{{sfn|Dalley|1989|page=159}} and to \"seat them on golden thrones\".{{sfn|Dalley|1989|page=159}}\n\nDuring the [[First Babylonian dynasty|Old Babylonian Period]] ({{circa}} 1830 BC \u2014 c. 1531 BC), a new set of deities known as the [[Igigi]] are introduced.{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=106}} The relationship between the Anunnaki and the Igigi is unclear.{{sfn|Brisch|2016}} On some occasions, the categories appear to be used synonymously,{{sfn|Leick|1998|page=8}}{{sfn|Brisch|2016}} but in other writings, such as ''The Poem of Erra'', there is a clear distinction between the two.{{sfn|Leick|1998|page=8}}{{sfn|Brisch|2016}} In the late Akkadian ''[[Atra-Hasis]]'' epic, the Igigi are the sixth generation of the gods who are forced to perform labor for the Anunnaki.{{sfn|Leick|1998|page=85}}{{sfn|Leick|2003|page=96}} After forty days, the Igigi rebel and the god [[Enki]], one of the Anunnaki, creates humans to replace them.{{sfn|Leick|1998|page=85}}{{sfn|Leick|2003|page=96}}\n\nFrom the [[Kassites|Middle Babylonian Period]] ({{circa}} 1592 \u2014 1155 BC) onward, the name ''Anunnaki'' was applied generally to the deities of the underworld;{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=34}} whereas the name ''Igigi'' was applied to the heavenly deities.{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=34}} During this period, the underworld deities [[Damkina]], [[Nergal]], and Mad\u0101nu are listed as the most powerful among the Anunnaki,{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=34}} alongside [[Marduk]], the [[national god]] of ancient Babylon.{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=34}}\n\nIn the standard Akkadian ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'' ({{circa}} 1200 BC) [[Utnapishtim]], the immortal survivor of the [[Flood myth|Great Flood]], describes the Anunnaki as seven judges of the Underworld, who set the land aflame as the storm approaches.{{sfn|Dalley|1989|pages=112}} Later, when the flood comes, [[Ishtar]] (the [[East Semitic]] equivalent to Inanna) and the Anunnaki mourn over the destruction of humanity.{{sfn|Leick|1998|page=8}}{{sfn|Dalley|1989|page=113}}\n\nIn the Babylonian ''[[En\u00fbma Eli\u0161]]'', Marduk assigns the Anunnaki their positions.{{sfn|Pritchard|2010|pages=33\u201334}} A late Babylonian version of the epic mentions 600 Anunnaki of the underworld,{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=34}} but only 300 Anunnaki of heaven,{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=34}} indicating the existence of a complex underworld [[cosmology]].{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=34}} In gratitude, the Anunnaki, the \"Great Gods\", build [[Esagila]], a \"splendid\" temple dedicated to Marduk, Ea, and Ellil.{{sfn|Pritchard|2010|page=34-35}} In the eighth-century BC ''Poem of Erra'', the Anunnaki are described as the brothers of the god Nergal{{sfn|Leick|1998|page=8}} and are depicted as antagonistic towards humanity.{{sfn|Leick|1998|page=8}}\n\nA badly damaged text from the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire|Neo-Assyrian Period]] (911 \u2014 612 BC) describes Marduk leading his army of Anunnaki into the sacred city of [[Nippur]] and causing a disturbance.{{sfn|Oshima|2010|page=145}} The disturbance causes a flood,{{sfn|Oshima|2010|page=145}} which forces the resident gods of Nippur to take shelter in the Eshumesha temple to [[Ninurta]].{{sfn|Oshima|2010|page=145}} Enlil is enraged at Marduk's transgression and orders the gods of Eshumesha to take Marduk and the other Anunnaki as prisoners.{{sfn|Oshima|2010|page=145}} The Anunnaki are captured,{{sfn|Oshima|2010|page=145}} but Marduk appoints his front-runner Mushteshirhablim to lead a

Eshumesha gods hear Nabu speak, they come out of their temple to search for him.{{sfn|Oshima|2010|page=146}} Marduk defeats the Eshumesha gods and takes 360 of them as prisoners of war, including Enlil himself.{{sfn|Oshima|2010|page=146}} Enlil protests that the Eshumesha gods are innocent,{{sfn|Oshima|2010|page=146}} so Marduk puts them on trial before the Anunnaki.{{sfn|Oshima|2010|page=146}} The text ends with a warning from Damkianna (another name for Ninhursag) to the gods and to humanity, pleading them not to repeat the war between the Anunnaki and the gods of Eshumesha.{{sfn|Oshima|2010|page=146}}\n\n===Hurrian and Hittite===\n[[File:Yazilikaya B 12erGruppe.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Ancient Hittite relief carving from [[Yaz\u0131l\u0131kaya]], a

In the earliest Sumerian writings about them, which come from the Post-Akkadian period, the Anunnaki are the most powerful deities in the [[Pantheon (religion)|pantheon]], descendants of [[Anu|An]] and [[Ki (goddess)|Ki]], the god of the heavens and the goddess of earth, and their primary function is to [[Time and fate deities|decree the fate of Sumerians]].\n\nIn ''[[Inanna#Descent into the Underworld|Inanna's Descent into the Netherworld]]'', the Anunnaki are portrayed as seven judges who sit before the throne of [[Ereshkigal]] in the [[Ancient Mesopotamian Underworld|Underworld]]. Later Akkadian texts, such as the ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'', follow this portrayal. During the Old Babylonian period, the Anunnaki were believed to be the [[chthonic]] deities of the Underworld, while the gods of the heavens were known as the [[Igigi]]. The ancient [[Hittites]] identified the Anunnaki as the oldest generation of gods, who had been overthrown and banished to the Underworld by the younger gods. The Anunnaki have featured prominently in modern [[pseudoarchaeology|pseudoarchaeological]] works, such as the books of [[Zecharia Sitchin]].\n\n==Etymology==\n[[File:Mesopotamian - Cylinder Seal -

variously written \"<sup>''[[determinative|d]]''</sup>a-nuna\", \"<sup>''d''</sup>a-nuna-ke<sub>4</sub>-ne\", or \"<sup>''d''</sup>a-nun-na\", meaning \"princely offspring\" or \"offspring of

likely due to the fact that each member of the Anunnaki had his or her own individual cult, separate from the others.{{sfn|Brisch|2016}} Similarly, no representations of the Anunnaki as a group have yet been discovered,{{sfn|Brisch|2016}} although a few depictions of its individual members have been identified.{{sfn|Brisch|2016}} Deities in ancient Mesopotamia were almost exclusively [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]].{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=93}} They were thought to possess extraordinary powers{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=93}} and were often envisioned as being of tremendous

religion#Heaven|Heaven]],{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=94}} but that a god's statue was a physical embodiment of the god himself.{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=94}}{{sfn|Nemet-Nejat|1998|page=186}} As such, [[Cult image|cult statues]] were given constant care and attention{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=94}}{{sfn|Nemet-Nejat|1998|pages=186\u2013187}} and a set of priests were assigned to tend to them.{{sfn|Nemet-Nejat|1998|pages=186\u2013188}} These priests would clothe the statues{{sfn|Nemet-Nejat|1998|page=186}} and place feasts before them so they could \"eat\".{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=94}}{{sfn|Nemet-Nejat|1998|pages=186\u2013187}} A deity's [[Temple#Mesopotamian temples|temple]] was believed to be that deity's literal place of

transport their cult statues along waterways during various [[religious festival]]s.{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|pages=44\u201345}} The gods also had [[Chariot#Ancient Near East|chariots]], which were used for transporting their cult statues by land.{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=52}} Sometimes a deity's cult statue would be transported to the location of a battle so that the deity could watch the battle unfold.{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=52}} The major deities of the Mesopotamian pantheon, which included the Anunnaki, were believed to participate in the \"assembly of the gods\",{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=98}} through which the gods made all of their decisions.{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=98}} This assembly was seen as a divine counterpart to the [[History of

descendants of the sky-god An.{{sfn|Leick|1998|page=8}}{{sfn|Katz|2003|page=403}}This group of deities probably included the \"seven gods who decree\":{{sfn|Kramer|1963|page=123}} An, Enlil, [[Enki]], [[Ninhursag]], [[Sin (mythology)|Nanna]], [[Utu]], and [[Inanna]].{{sfn|Kramer|1963|pages=122\u2013123}}\n\nAlthough certain deities are described as members of the Anunnaki, no complete list of the names of all the Anunnaki has survived{{sfn|Brisch|2016}} and they are usually only referred to as a cohesive group in literary texts.{{sfn|Leick|1998|page=8}}{{sfn|Brisch|2016}} Furthermore, Sumerian texts describe the Anunnaki inconsistently{{sfn|Brisch|2016}} and do not agree on how many Anunnaki there were, or what their divine function was.{{sfn|Leick|1998|page=8}}{{sfn|Brisch|2016}} Originally, the Anunnaki appear to have been heavenly deities with immense powers.{{sfn|Brisch|2016}} In the poem ''Enki and the World Order'', the Anunnaki \"do homage\" to Enki, sing hymns of praise in his honor, and \"take up their dwellings\" among the people of Sumer.{{sfn|Leick|1998|page=8}}{{sfn|Kramer|1963|page=180}} The same composition twice states that the Anunnaki \"decree the fates of mankind\".{{sfn|Leick|1998|page=8}}\n\nVirtually every major deity in the Sumerian pantheon was regarded as the patron of a specific city{{sfn|Nemet-Nejat|1998|page=179}} and was expected to protect that city's interests.{{sfn|Nemet-Nejat|1998|page=179}} The deity was believed to permanently reside within that city's temple.{{sfn|Nemet-Nejat|1998|page=187-189}} One text mentions as many as fifty Anunnaki associated with the city of [[Eridu]].{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=34}}{{sfn|Edzard|1965|pages=17\u2013140}} In ''[[Inanna#Descent into the Underworld|Inanna's Descent into the Netherworld]]'', there are only seven Anunnaki, who reside within the [[Kur|Underworld]] and serve as judges.{{sfn|Leick|1998|page=8}}{{sfn|Wolkstein|Kramer|1983|page=60}} [[Inanna]] stands trial before them for her attempt to take over the Underworld;{{sfn|Leick|1998|page=8}}{{sfn|Wolkstein|Kramer|1983|page=60}} they deem her guilty of [[hubris]] and condemn her to death.{{sfn|Wolkstein|Kramer|1983|page=60}}\n\nMajor deities in Sumerian mythology were associated with specific celestial bodies.{{sfn|Nemet-Nejat|1998|pages=201\u2013203}} Inanna was believed to be the planet [[Venus]].{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|pages=108\u2013109}}{{sfn|Nemet-Nejat|1998|page=203}} Utu was believed to be the sun.{{sfn|Nemet-Nejat|1998|page=203}}{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|pages=182\u2013184}} Nanna was the moon.{{sfn|Nemet-Nejat|1998|page=203}}{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=135}} An was identified with all the stars of the [[Celestial equator|equatorial sky]], Enlil with those of the [[Northern celestial hemisphere|northern sky]], and Enki with those of the [[Southern Celestial Hemisphere|southern sky]].{{sfn|Rogers|1998|page=13}} The path of Enlil's celestial orbit was a continuous, symmetrical circle around the [[Celestial pole|north celestial pole]],{{sfn|Levenda|2008|page=29}} but those of An and Enki were believed to intersect at various points.{{sfn|Levenda|2008|pages=29\u201330}}\n\n===Akkadian, Babylonian, and Assyrian===\n{{rquote|right|Reverence begets favour, sacrifice prolongs

In [[Inanna#Akkadian version|an abbreviated Akkadian version of ''Inanna's Descent'']] written in the early second millennium, [[Ereshkigal]], the queen of the Underworld, comments that she \"drink[s] water with the Anunnaki\".{{sfn|Dalley|1989|page=156}} Later in the same poem, Ereshkigal orders her servant [[Namtar]] to fetch the Anunnaki from Egalgina,{{sfn|Dalley|1989|page=159}} to \"decorate the threshold steps with coral\",{{sfn|Dalley|1989|page=159}} and to \"seat them on golden thrones\".{{sfn|Dalley|1989|page=159}}\n\nDuring the [[First Babylonian dynasty|Old Babylonian Period]] ({{circa}} 1830 BC \u2014 c. 1531 BC), a new set of deities known as the [[Igigi]] are introduced.{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=106}} The relationship between the Anunnaki and the Igigi is unclear.{{sfn|Brisch|2016}} On some occasions, the categories appear to be used synonymously,{{sfn|Leick|1998|page=8}}{{sfn|Brisch|2016}} but in other writings, such as ''The Poem of Erra'', there is a clear distinction between the two.{{sfn|Leick|1998|page=8}}{{sfn|Brisch|2016}} In the late Akkadian ''[[Atra-Hasis]]'' epic, the Igigi are the sixth generation of the gods who are forced to perform labor for the Anunnaki.{{sfn|Leick|1998|page=85}}{{sfn|Leick|2003|page=96}} After forty days, the Igigi rebel and the god [[Enki]], one of the Anunnaki, creates humans to replace them.{{sfn|Leick|1998|page=85}}{{sfn|Leick|2003|page=96}}\n\nFrom the [[Kassites|Middle Babylonian Period]] ({{circa}} 1592 \u2014 1155 BC) onward, the name ''Anunnaki'' was applied generally to the deities of the underworld;{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=34}} whereas the name ''Igigi'' was applied to the heavenly deities.{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=34}} During this period, the underworld deities [[Damkina]], [[Nergal]], and Mad\u0101nu are listed as the most powerful among the Anunnaki,{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=34}} alongside [[Marduk]], the [[national god]] of ancient Babylon.{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=34}}\n\nIn the standard Akkadian ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'' ({{circa}} 1200 BC) [[Utnapishtim]], the immortal survivor of the [[Flood myth|Great Flood]], describes the Anunnaki as seven judges of the Underworld, who set the land aflame as the storm approaches.{{sfn|Dalley|1989|pages=112}} Later, when the flood comes, [[Ishtar]] (the [[East Semitic]] equivalent to Inanna) and the Anunnaki mourn over the destruction of humanity.{{sfn|Leick|1998|page=8}}{{sfn|Dalley|1989|page=113}}\n\nIn the Babylonian ''[[En\u00fbma Eli\u0161]]'', Marduk assigns the Anunnaki their positions.{{sfn|Pritchard|2010|pages=33\u201334}} A late Babylonian version of the epic mentions 600 Anunnaki of the underworld,{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=34}} but only 300 Anunnaki of heaven,{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=34}} indicating the existence of a complex underworld [[cosmology]].{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=34}} In gratitude, the Anunnaki, the \"Great Gods\", build [[Esagila]], a \"splendid\" temple dedicated to Marduk, Ea, and Ellil.{{sfn|Pritchard|2010|page=34-35}} In the eighth-century BC ''Poem of Erra'', the Anunnaki are described as the brothers of the god Nergal{{sfn|Leick|1998|page=8}} and are depicted as antagonistic towards humanity.{{sfn|Leick|1998|page=8}}\n\nA badly damaged text from the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire|Neo-Assyrian Period]] (911 \u2014 612 BC) describes Marduk leading his army of Anunnaki into the sacred city of [[Nippur]] and causing a disturbance.{{sfn|Oshima|2010|page=145}} The disturbance causes a flood,{{sfn|Oshima|2010|page=145}} which forces the resident gods of Nippur to take shelter in the Eshumesha temple to [[Ninurta]].{{sfn|Oshima|2010|page=145}} Enlil is enraged at Marduk's transgression and orders the gods of Eshumesha to take Marduk and the other Anunnaki as prisoners.{{sfn|Oshima|2010|page=145}} The Anunnaki are captured,{{sfn|Oshima|2010|page=145}} but Marduk appoints his front-runner Mushteshirhablim to lead a

Eshumesha gods hear Nabu speak, they come out of their temple to search for him.{{sfn|Oshima|2010|page=146}} Marduk defeats the Eshumesha gods and takes 360 of them as prisoners of war, including Enlil himself.{{sfn|Oshima|2010|page=146}} Enlil protests that the Eshumesha gods are innocent,{{sfn|Oshima|2010|page=146}} so Marduk puts them on trial before the Anunnaki.{{sfn|Oshima|2010|page=146}} The text ends with a warning from Damkianna (another name for Ninhursag) to the gods and to humanity, pleading them not to repeat the war between the Anunnaki and the gods of Eshumesha.{{sfn|Oshima|2010|page=146}}\n\n===Hurrian and Hittite===\n[[File:Yazilikaya B 12erGruppe.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|Ancient Hittite relief carving from [[Yaz\u0131l\u0131kaya]], a

The Symbiotes bond with their hosts, creating a [[Symbiosis|symbiotic]] bond through which a single entity is created. They also are able to slightly alter their hosts' personalities, and/or memories by influencing their darkest desires and wants, along with amplifying their physical and emotional traits and personality, granting them super-human abilities. \n\nThe first and most well-known symbiote is [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]], who originally attached itself to Spider-Man during the [[Secret Wars|''Secret Wars'']] storyline, but after Spider-Man rejected it, Venom instead attached itself to [[Eddie Brock]], and together they became one of Spider-Man's [[Archenemy|archenemies]]; the Venom symbiote would go on to have numerous other hosts, some of them villains as well, such as [[Mac Gargan]], some heroes, such as [[Flash Thompson]] (who became Agent Venom). Other well-known symbiotes are [[Carnage (comics)|Carnage]], whose most common host is serial killer [[Cletus Kasady]], and [[Anti-Venom]].\n\nThe symbiotes have appeared in various media. Venom has been the most featured one, appearing as the main antagonist of ''[[Spider-Man 3]]'', and the titular protagonist and [[antihero]] of ''[[Venom (2018 film)|Venom]]''; the latter also featured other symbiotes, most notably [[Riot (comics)|Riot]], who served as the film's main antagonist. how MyBitCast symbiote\n\n== Publication history ==\nThe first appearance(s) of a symbiote occurs in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #252, ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'' #90, and ''[[Marvel Team-Up]]'' #141 (released concurrently in May 1984), in which [[Spider-Man]] brings one home to Earth after the [[Secret Wars]] (''Secret Wars'' #8, which was released months later, details of his first encounter with it).

When the [[Celestials]] began their vast plan to evolve the universe, Knull, seeing that his \"Kingdom\" was being touched, retaliated by constructing All-Black, the first symbiote, and cut a Celestial's head. Then, the other Celestials banished Knull along with the severed Celestial head deeper in the Void.

However, when a dragon-like composite went to the medieval Earth, [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] defeated it and destroyed the connection between Knull and the symbiotes. Upon Knull's severed connection to the symbiotes, the symbiote hive-mind began to explore notions of honor and nobility as they bonded to benevolent hosts. The symbiotes subsequently rebelled against their god, imprisoning him at the heart of an artificial planet in the [[Andromeda Galaxy]] they called Klyntar, which is their species name. Ashamed of their dark past, the symbiotes desired to spread and maintain peace throughout the Cosmos by seeking out worthy hosts from various species in order to create an organization of noble warriors.<ref name=Ve4/> However, these [[Altruism|altruistic]] goals were imperfect, as the Klyntar symbiotes could be corrupted by hosts with harmful chemical imbalances or problematic personality attributes, turning them into destructive parasites who would spread lies and disinformation about their own kind in order to make other peoples fear and hate the Klyntar species as a whole.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = [[Brian Michael Bendis]]|penciller = Valerio Schiti|inker = Valerio Schiti|title = Guardians of the Galaxy|volume = 3|issue = #23|date = 21 January 2015|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref>\n\nThe corrupted Klyntar became more widespread than their benevolent counterparts, establishing a spacefaring culture dedicated to infecting and overtaking whole planets and reestablishing the Imperium.

Venom after got \"purified\" wanted to keep his new offspring safe from people who would use it for bad things and wanted to make it a hero like itself instead of becoming another evil symbiote like [[Carnage (comics)|Carnage]] so gave birth to it in [[Alchemax]]. After the Venom symbiote was stolen from its first host Tel-Kar, the offspring bonded to Eddie so they would save Venom with the help of the [[Skrull]] Warbride M'Lanz. In the battle against Tel-Kar, Sleeper briefly bonds to M'Lanz and her and Eddie with Venom return to Earth where she leaves them. When Tel-Kar returned to Earth and tried to kill Eddie, Sleeper intervened and bonded with Tel-Kar, lobotomizing him in the process as revenge for what he had done to the Venom symbiote and Eddie. Despite Brock being dismayed by this, Sleeper bid him farewell and set out to explore the cosmos. \n|-\n| '''[[Erik Killmonger#Intergalactic Empire of Wakanda|N'Jadaka]]''' || ''[[Black Panther (comic book)|Black Panther]]'' Vol. 7 #4 (September 2018)\n|| After 2,000 years in the future, N'Jadaka \u2013 a man named after [[Erik Killmonger]]'s real name \u2013 and his team were exploring the other planets to expand the [[Wakanda]] Empire in the Galaxy and while exploring a planet they were attacked by the Between. He and his men were trying to survive until he encountered a symbiote. He bonded to the symbiote since they had hatred against the current Wakandan Emperor who send N'Jadaka to get killed and had made the symbiotes an endangered species. With its power, he killed the Shadow People and the Emperor and became the new ruler of Wakanda. Then he with the symbiote killed the current Avatar of [[Bast (comics)|Bast]] and became the new Avatar.\n|-\n| '''Magic Venom''' || ''Venom'' Vol. 4 #13 (June 2019) || During the ''[[War of the Realms]]'' event, after Eddie Brock was separated from Venom, he with his son Dylan are approached by one of [[Malekith the Accursed|Malekith]]'s War Witches. She gave Eddie one of the [[Elves (Marvel Comics)#Dark-Elves|Dark Elves]]' Dreamstone in hopes of recruiting Eddie into Malekith's army. The Dreamstone turned into an artificial symbiote similar to Venom, but without a mind of its own. Eddie eventually bonded the pieces of the suit to civilians in order to save them from the invasion.\n|-\n| '''Void Knight''' || ''[[Silver Surfer (comic book)|Silver Surfer]]: Black'' #2 (September 2019) || During a confrontation between Knull and the Silver Surfer, Knull infected the Surfer with his Abyss, turning him into his Void Knight. However, [[Ego (comics)|Ego]] freed the Silver Surfer from Knull's control, destroying the symbiote and allowing him to escape.\n|}\n\n== Other versions ==\n{{Further|Alternative versions of Venom}}\n\n=== Ultimate Marvel ===\nIn the [[Ultimate Marvel]] universe, the '''Venom suit''' is a man-made creation born of an experiment by [[Richard and Mary Parker#Ultimate Marvel|Richard Parker]] and [[List of Marvel Comics characters: B#Carl Brock|Edward Brock Sr.]] to develop a protoplasmic cure for severe illness, while [[Bolivar Trask#Ultimate Marvel|Bolivar Trask]] who was funding the research intended to weaponized it. It used Richard's Rna as the starting base for it, thus himself and [[Spider-Man (Ultimate Marvel character)|Peter]] are \"related\" to it. When bonding to a host, the organic matter that comprises the suit envelops the host, regardless of resistance, temporarily blinding it, before encasing itself in a hard, casing, similar to a [[pupa]]. When the host emerges, the suit then shifts its appearance and function to assist its host, such as creating eyes for it to see through, or tries to take it over, inducing a homicidal rage and attempting to feed itself if bonded with an incompatible host. When bonded with a host and forcibly removed, the suit leaves trace amounts of itself in their bloodstream, which attracts other samples of Venom to itself, and can overload Peter's spider-sense. In the video game ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (video game)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]'', absorbing the trace amounts in Peter's blood allowed Eddie to take complete control of the suit, gaining a greater ability to talk and a spider symbol on his chest.\n\nVenom's only known weakness is electricity, and larger amounts of the suit will need more electricity to kill, as varying amounts of the suit will be stunned or vaporized by electric shocks. This was first seen in ''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #38, when an electric wire got tangled around Venom's foot. An electrocution from live power-lines vaporised the smaller amount on Peter, while a similar amount disabled Eddie. Note in the video game ''Ultimate Spider-Man'', when [[Electro (Marvel Comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Electro]] electrocutes Venom during a cutscene, the suit is not affected by the shock like the live power-line did in the \"Venom\" arc. The suit can take the [[Shocker (comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Shocker]]'s vibro-shocks, and can protect its host from a bullet, who feels nothing more than a relaxing vibration. When worn by a host other than Richard's son Peter, the host is compelled to take the life energy of other human beings or else have their own be consumed by the suit instead. The original Spider-Man (Peter Parker) was able to control the suit to a greater extent than anyone because of his powers and because the suit was designed for his father.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer=Brian Michael Bendis|penciller=Mark Bagley|inker=Art Thibert and Rodney Ramos|colorist=Transparency Digital|letterer=VC's Chris Eliopoulos|editor=Ralph Macchio, Brian Smith, [[C.B.

In the conclusion of ''[[The Alien Costume]]'', Venom is defeated by Spider-Man and sent into space, however [[Dormammu]] and [[Baron Mordo]] divert the rocket allowing Venom back to Earth. When Venom fails to get a [[Stark Industries]] portal device for Mordo, they bond Venom's offspring whom Cletus Kasady coins the name Carnage and send him to help Venom. With help from [[Iron Man]], Eddie Brock willingly separates from Venom, after having a change of heart. When Carnage kidnaps [[Ashley Kafka]] whom Eddie is in love with Eddie rejoins with the symbiote and helps Spider-Man, Iron Man and [[War Machine (comics)|War Machine]]. When Carnage attempts to throw Kafka into limbo, the place between portals, Venom stops him and knocks them both into limbo, foiling Dormannu's plans for good. During the ''[[Spider Wars]]'' season finale, Carnage bonds with an alternate dejected Spider-Man to create [[Spider Carnage]].\n* In ''[[Spider-Man Unlimited]]'', Venom and Carnage are primary villains, who in the pilot episode board a shuttle piloted by [[John Jameson (comics)|John Jameson]] for [[Counter-Earth]] to start a new empire of Symbiotes. Here the symbiotes are more [[amorphous]] creatures that rely on stretching bodies then webbing, and are more exaggerated such as Carnage sporting spikes. The in-universe explanation is that the Symbiotes have bonded completely with their hosts, although under the Synoptic's guide Venom & Carnage learned their shapeshifting abilities (into liquid, etc.) as Spidey referred to that as \"new powers\". \n* Venom appears in ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man (TV series)|The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'', with Spider-Man's version voiced by [[Josh Keaton]], and Eddie Brock's version voiced by [[Benjamin Diskin]]. In the episode \"The Uncertainly Principle\", the Symbiote arrives on Earth by stowing away on the [[space shuttle]]. After being rejected by Spider-Man, it bonds with Eddie in the episode \"Intervention\", and is ultimately defeated in the episode \"Nature vs. Nurture\". Venom reappeared in the Season Two episodes \"First Steps\", \"Growing Pains\", and \"Identity Crisis\", where he attempts to expose Spider-Man's secret identity but his plans are foiled. Carnage was also set to appear in the third season.\n* The Venom, Carnage, and Anti-Venom Symbiotes appear in ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (TV series)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]''. Venom and Anti-Venom are created by Doctor Octopus for [[Oscorp]]. Venom was created by altering a sample of Spider-Man's DNA and Anti-Venom was created from the Venom sample used to counter and destroy the Venom Symbiote. The Carnage symbiote is created by Green Goblin and later recreated by [[Morbius, the Living Vampire|Michael Morbius]] of [[Hydra (comics)|HYDRA]] from the Venom symbiote he obtained.\n* In the ''[[Hulk and the Agents of S.M.A.S.H.]]'' episode \"The Venom Within\", Doctor Octopus creates \"Gamma Venom\" by having the Venom Symbiote combine with each members of the Agents of S.M.A.S.H. This version of the Venom Symbiote is destroyed by the Agents of S.M.A.S.H. and Spider-Man.\n* The Symbiotes appear in the animated ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (TV series)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'' series that debuted in 2015. Their origins are revealed in the three-part episode \"Symbiote War\" as originally coming from Klyntar who were altered by [[Thanos]] in his experiments on the mining planet, later revealed to be what remained of Groot's homeworld. The Exolons are also referenced inhabiting [[Wraith (Zak-Del)|Wraith]]'s body.\n* The Venom Symbiote appears in the animated ''[[Spider-Man (2017 TV series)|Spider-Man]]'' series, referred to as the V-252 during the first season before assuming the name Venom in the second season. In this series, Horizon High headmaster [[Max Modell]] acquires the symbiote from the space program in hopes of discovering a new element for the periodic table. The V-252 first appeared in the episode \"A Day in the Life\", in which [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]] steals the symbiote as a means to sell it to the black market, but Spider-Man recaptures and returns the V-252 to Horizon High. He briefly merged with Spider-Man from \"Sandman\" and \"Stark Expo\", and Flash Thompson during \"Venom\". In Season 2, the V-252 merges with Eddie Brock in \"Dead Man's Party\" but is incapacitated by an experimental sonic device in \"Venom Returns\". Venom is eventually reawakened by experimentation that ultimately alters his genealogy, enabling him to survive without the need for a host, yet is defeated by Spider-Man shortly after Otto Octavius undoes their body-swap in \"Superior\". In Season 3, subtitled ''Maximum Venom'', Venom sends an extension of himself to unleash a weapon that ultimately summons more symbiotes to Earth from his home planet in the two-part episode \"Web of Venom\".\n\n=== Film ===\n==== Sam Raimi film series ====\n{{Main|Spider-Man in film #Sam Raimi films}}\nThe [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]] symbiote appears in ''[[Spider-Man 3]]''. In this version, instead of brought to Earth in a human spaceship, it came from space after it landed on Earth inside a [[meteorite]]. The symbiote fused with the sleeping [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker / Spider-Man]]'s suit enhancing his powers, abilities and his anger. A small is studied and analyzed by [[Lizard (comics)|Curt Conners]]. After being rejected by Parker following the dark influence it had on him at the church when ringing the bell, the alien attaches to [[Eddie Brock]] ([[Topher Grace]]). Later, both are killed in an explosion at the climax. A spin-off film about Venom was planned after the release of ''Spider-Man 3'', but was cancelled.\n\n==== Marc Webb films ====\n{{Main|Spider-Man in film #Marc Webb films}}\nIn trailers for ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man 2]]'', the Venom symbiote appeared briefly among various elements of supervillain technology seen in the [[Gentleman (comics)|Gustav Fiers / The Gentleman]]'s agency.

The [[PlayStation 2]], [[PlayStation Portable]] and [[Wii]] versions of the game also feature the character [[Shriek (character)|Shriek]], whose powers come from a symbiote in this game which is also black in color. However, the symbiote only covers half of her body,\n* In ''[[Spider-Man: Web of Shadows]]'', Venom returns to New York. During a fight with Venom, the Symbiote suddenly reproduces and the spawn bonds with Spider-Man creating a replica of the Black Suit, but with considerably more Carnage-like abilities such as projecting bladed tentacles. Over the course of the game, Venom creates symbiote \"seed-pods\" in various locations around the city which absorb passing civilians and infect them with various types of symbiote ranging from '''Snatcher Symbiotes''' (the small black Symbiotes that drag unsuspecting victims to the \"seed-pods\"), '''Zombie Symbiotes''' (the weak white Symbiotes), '''Berserker Symbiotes''' (the red shiny Symbiotes), '''Grappler Symbiotes''' (black and red versions of the Berserkers), and '''Slasher Symbiotes''' (the white and pink Symbiotes). The Symbiotes even manage to infect [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]], [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)|Vulture]], [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]] and [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]]. Symbiote-Electro and Symbiote-Vulture go on to spawn other symbiotes with powers similar to their hosts resulting in '''Electrolings''' and '''Vulturelings'''. All are eventually defeated by Spider-Man and the symbiotes are separated from them.\n* In ''[[Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions]]'', the Ultimate Marvel version of Spider-Man in his symbiote suit is a playable character. [[Madame Web]] had restored the black suit as it provides this world's Peter Parker with additional abilities that he will require to succeed in his mission, while she uses her psychic abilities to prevent the suit attempting to take over his mind. However, Madame Web's abilities do not seem to be absolute, as Ultimate Spider-Man experiences occasional bouts of anger. Also, the Ultimate version of Carnage appears as the final boss in the Ultimate levels where it was granted the ability to reanimate its victims into symbiotic zombie-like creatures thanks to the powers of a fragment of the Tablet of Order and Chaos when S.H.I.E.L.D. are foolishly mixing the fragment with Carnage.\n* In ''[[Spider-Man: Edge of Time]]'', it is revealed that the brainwashed Anti-Venom is responsible for killing present-day [[Spider-Man]], altering the future of the ''[[Marvel 2099]]'' timeline and prompting [[Spider-Man 2099]] to tamper with the timeline further in order to save his predecessor's life and repair the timestream. In one of their battles, Anti-Venom, Doctor Octopus (who in the new timeline was never a villain, but still uses his trademark arms) and game exclusive villain Dr. Walker Sloan (the man from 2099 who tried to alter the timeline) are knocked into a portal and become '''Atrocity''' (vocal effects provided by [[Fred Tatasciore]]), a bloated version of Anti-Venom with tentacles. Both Atrocity and the future Peter Parker are defeated with the time resetting presumably separating Atrocity back into Walker Sloan, Anti-Venom, and Doctor Octopus.\n* Two versions of the black suit appear as an optional costume in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man (2012 video game)|The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' video game, based on its appearance in the ''Spider-Man 3'' film, and a modified version of Spider-Man's costume from ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' film. Backstory for the game also reveals that the game version of the Symbiote is based on a \"black goo\" recovered from space and that it is bonded with the game's version of the Scorpion. This is an allusion to the comics, where Mac Gargan briefly assumed the role of Venom.\n* In ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man 2]]'', a version of Venom exists in the secret [[Oscorp]] experiment run in [[Ravencroft]] called \"The Venom Project\", using [[nanites]] as a regenerating body armor. It is used on notorious serial killer Cletus Kasady, which transforms him into Carnage under the direction of [[Donald Menken]] and [[Kingpin (character)|Kingpin]].\n* Symbiote Scientists appear in ''[[Lego Marvel Super Heroes]]''.\n* Various Symbiote characters are featured in the mobile game ''[[Spider-Man Unlimited (video game)|Spider-Man Unlimited]]'' with the Symbiote World featured as a level.\n* Various Symbiotes appear in the [[Facebook]] game ''[[Marvel: Avengers Alliance]]'': [[Mac Gargan|Venom]], [[Flash Thompson|Agent Venom]], [[Eddie Brock|Anti-Venom]], [[Scream (comics)|Scream]] and [[Hybrid (Scott Washington)|Hybrid]].\n* Symbiotes \"connect together\" in a ''[[Marvel Puzzle Quest]]'' storyline. Besides Mac Gargan and Eddie Brock as Venom and Cletus Kasady's Carnage, there are four new Symbiotes: A green male named '''Carrier''', an orange female named '''Horror''', a teal teethy creature named '''Demolisher''', and a magenta dog-like creature named '''Mutation'''.\n* In ''[[Marvel Avengers Academy]]'', the symbiotes appear which were taken from their home planet by Oscorp. Spider-Man tried to save the symbiotes, but got bonded to them and then they tried to take over the Academy. They failed, but decided to remain on Earth.\n* The Symbiotes appears in ''[[Marvel vs. Capcom Infinite]]''. In the game's story, [[Jedah Dohma]] uses the [[Infinity Gems|Soul Stone]] to steal a million souls from Earth and feed them to a Giant Symbiote, planning to strengthen it and use it as a weapon against [[Ultron]] [[Sigma (Mega Man X)|Sigma]]. He gives pieces of the symbiotes to [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]][[Umbrella Corp|brella]] to bond the pieces to virus-infected subjects to stabilize them. In a battle against Jedah the heroes are successful, but then he unleashes the creature on the New Metro City. When [[Chris Redfield]] tries attacking it, he accidentally causes part of the symbiote to bond to Spider-Man, forcing the latter to fight against [[Frank West (Dead Rising)|Frank West]] and [[Mike Haggar]] against his will (though the symbiote is removed after Frank causes some car alarms to go off). The creature is unleashed on New Metro City, but is destroyed by the heroes using three of the Infinity Stones. Venom also appears as a playable character via [[downloadable content]].\n* In the 2018 ''[[Spider-Man (2018 video game)|Spider-Man]]'' video game, during a conversation between Spider-Man and [[Yuri Watanabe]], she quickly ask Spider-Man as a joke if he has a black and white suit indicating that Spider-Man at some point had a black suit but he got rid of it. In the post credit scene [[Norman Osborn]] goes into a secret lab inside his house where it shows his son [[Harry Osborn]], inside a chamber labeled G-35 with black web-like substance attached to his body. When Spider-Man looks through certain windows there is a few collectibles on a shelf, including a black suit Spider-Man figure.\n* In the 2014 fighting video game ''[[Marvel: Contest of Champions]]'', the '''Symbioids''' are symbiotes merged with the [[Super-Adaptoid|Adaptioids]]. Venom, Carnage and Agent Venom appear as playable characters. Also featured are also '''VenomPool''' (amalgamation of [[Deadpool]] and Venom), '''Venom the Duck''' (amalgamation of [[Howard the Duck]] and Venom) and '''Symbiote Supreme''' (amalgamation of [[Doctor Strange]] and Venom).\n\n=== Attractions ===\n* [[Scream (comics)|Scream]] appears as one of the villains in [[Universal Orlando]]'s [[Islands of Adventure]] ''[[The Amazing Adventures of Spider-Man]]'' ride.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n*[http://www.thevenomsite.com List of Venom Comics] at TheVenomSite.com\n*{{Marveldatabase|Klyntar_(Race)|Klyntar}}\n*[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/symbiotes/4060-56880/characters/ Symbiotes] at Comic Vine\n*[https://m.ign.com/articles/2018/10/19/venom-movie-marvels-most-powerful-symbiotes-ranked Marvel's most powerful symbiotes] at IGN\n*[https://screenrant.com/symbiotes-stronger-weaker-venom/ 16 Symbiotes More Powerful Than Venom (And 9 Weaker)] at Screenrant\n*[https://m.ranker.com/list/the-real-comic-book-origin-of-venom/stephanroget The Real Origin Story Of The Venom Symbiote Is Much More Complicated Than You Think] at Ranker\n\n{{Symbiote Family and Hosts}}\n{{Navboxes\n|title=Related topics to Symbiotes\n|list1=\n{{Spider-Man characters}}\n{{Eddie Brock}}\n{{Ultimate Spider-Man}}\n{{Skrull}}\n{{Guardians of the Galaxy}}\n{{Galactus}}\n{{Marvel Comics deities}}\n{{Avengers}}\n{{X-Men}}\n{{Goblin (Marvel Comics)}}\n{{S.H.I.E.L.D.}}\n{{Marvel Cosmic}}\n}}\n\n[[Category:Venom (Marvel Comics)]]\n[[Category:Fictional amorphous creatures]]\n[[Category:Fictional parasites and parasitoids]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Roger Stern]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Tom DeFalco]]\n[[Category:Characters created by David Michelinie]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Mike Zeck]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics alien species]]\n[[Category:Hive minds in fiction]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters who can duplicate themselves]]\n[[Category:Fictional superorganisms]]\n", "text_old": "{{for|uses of \"Symbiosis\" or \"Symbiont\"|Symbiosis (disambiguation)}}\n{{Short description|Fictional race in Marvel Comics}}\n{{Infobox comics species\n<!--Wikipedia:WikiProject Comics-->\n|species =Symbiote\n|image = Venom vs. carnage.jpg\n|imagesize = <!-- default 250 -->\n|caption = The two most enduring symbiotic characters, [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]] (right) and its offspring [[Carnage (comics)|Carnage]], battling each other in the cover of ''Venom vs. Carnage'' #1 (July 2004).

The Symbiotes bond with their hosts, creating a [[Symbiosis|symbiotic]] bond through which a single entity is created. They also are able to slightly alter their hosts' personalities, and/or memories by influencing their darkest desires and wants, along with amplifying their physical and emotional traits and personality, granting them super-human abilities. \n\nThe first and most well-known symbiote is [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]], who originally attached itself to Spider-Man during the [[Secret Wars|''Secret Wars'']] storyline, but after Spider-Man rejected it, Venom instead attached itself to [[Eddie Brock]], and together they became one of Spider-Man's [[Archenemy|archenemies]]; the Venom symbiote would go on to have numerous other hosts, some of them villains as well, such as [[Mac Gargan]], some heroes, such as [[Flash Thompson]] (who became Agent Venom). Other well-known symbiotes are [[Carnage (comics)|Carnage]], whose most common host is serial killer [[Cletus Kasady]], and [[Anti-Venom]].\n\nThe symbiotes have appeared in various media. Venom has been the most featured one, appearing as the main antagonist of ''[[Spider-Man 3]]'', and the titular protagonist and [[antihero]] of ''[[Venom (2018 film)|Venom]]''; the latter also featured other symbiotes, most notably [[Riot (comics)|Riot]], who served as the film's main antagonist.\n\n== Publication history ==\nThe first appearance(s) of a symbiote occurs in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #252, ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'' #90, and ''[[Marvel Team-Up]]'' #141 (released concurrently in May 1984), in which [[Spider-Man]] brings one home to Earth after the [[Secret Wars]] (''Secret Wars'' #8, which was released months later, details of his first encounter with it). The concept was created by a Marvel Comics reader,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2007/05/16/randy-schuellers-brush-with-comic-history/ |title=Comic Book Urban Legends Revealed Extra: Randy Schueller\u2019s Brush With Comic History &#124; Comics Should Be Good! | publisher=ComicBookResources.com |date=16 May 2007|access-date=2010-04-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190521201414/https://www.cbr.com/comic-book-urban-legends-revealed-extra-randy-schuellers-brush-with-comic-history/|archive-date=8 October 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> with the publisher purchasing the idea for $220. The original design was then modified by [[Mike Zeck]], becoming the Venom symbiote. The concept would be explored and used throughout multiple story lines, spin-off comics, and derivative projects.\n<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://m.ign.com/articles/2019/03/01/the-impact-of-venoms-grand-new-origin|title=The Impact of Venom's Grand New Origin|publisher=[[IGN]]|date=2 March 2019|access-date=2019-03-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190306111820/https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/03/01/the-impact-of-venoms-grand-new-origin|archive-date=6 March 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== Fictional history ==\nSymbiotes were originally created by an ancient malevolent primordial deity named [[Knull (comics)|Knull]]. When the [[Celestials]] began their vast plan to evolve the universe, Knull, seeing that his \"Kingdom\" was being touched, retaliated by constructing All-Black, the first symbiote, and cut a Celestial's head. Then, the other Celestials banished Knull along with the severed Celestial head deeper in the Void. After that, he started using the head with its Cosmic energies as a Forge for the symbiotes, where they got the weaknesses of sound and fire \u2013 the head would later become [[Knowhere]].<ref>{{cite web|url = https://twitter.com/Doncates/status/1022604840051109888|title = Yep!

However, when a dragon-like composite went to the medieval Earth, [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] defeated it and destroyed the connection between Knull and the symbiotes. Upon Knull's severed connection to the symbiotes, the symbiote hive-mind began to explore notions of honor and nobility as they bonded to benevolent hosts. The symbiotes subsequently rebelled against their god, imprisoning him at the heart of an artificial planet in the [[Andromeda Galaxy]] they called Klyntar, which is their species name. Ashamed of their dark past, the symbiotes desired to spread and maintain peace throughout the Cosmos by seeking out worthy hosts from various species in order to create an organization of noble warriors.<ref name=Ve4/> However, these [[Altruism|altruistic]] goals were imperfect, as the Klyntar symbiotes could be corrupted by hosts with harmful chemical imbalances or problematic personality attributes, turning them into destructive parasites who would spread lies and disinformation about their own kind in order to make other peoples fear and hate the Klyntar species as a whole.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer = [[Brian Michael Bendis]]|penciller = Valerio Schiti|inker = Valerio Schiti|title = Guardians of the Galaxy|volume = 3|issue = #23|date = 21 January 2015|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}</ref>\n\nThe corrupted Klyntar became more widespread than their benevolent counterparts, establishing a spacefaring culture dedicated to infecting and overtaking whole planets and reestablishing the Imperium. The corrupted Symbiotes forced their hosts to perform death-defying feats in order to feed off of the resulting surges of hormones like adrenaline and phenethylamine.

However, [[Ego (comics)|Ego]] freed the Silver Surfer from Knull's control, destroying the symbiote and allowing him to escape.\n|}\n\n== Other versions ==\n{{Further|Alternative versions of Venom}}\n\n=== Ultimate Marvel ===\nIn the [[Ultimate Marvel]] universe, the '''Venom suit''' is a man-made creation born of an experiment by [[Richard and Mary Parker#Ultimate Marvel|Richard Parker]] and [[List of Marvel Comics characters: B#Carl Brock|Edward Brock Sr.]] to develop a protoplasmic cure for severe illness, while [[Bolivar Trask#Ultimate Marvel|Bolivar Trask]] who was funding the research intended to weaponized it. It used Richard's Rna as the starting base for it, thus himself and [[Spider-Man (Ultimate Marvel character)|Peter]] are \"related\" to it. When bonding to a host, the organic matter that comprises the suit envelops the host, regardless of resistance, temporarily blinding it, before encasing itself in a hard, casing, similar to a [[pupa]]. When the host emerges, the suit then shifts its appearance and function to assist its host, such as creating eyes for it to see through, or tries to take it over, inducing a homicidal rage and attempting to feed itself if bonded with an incompatible host. When bonded with a host and forcibly removed, the suit leaves trace amounts of itself in their bloodstream, which attracts other samples of Venom to itself, and can overload Peter's spider-sense. In the video game ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (video game)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]'', absorbing the trace amounts in Peter's blood allowed Eddie to take complete control of the suit, gaining a greater ability to talk and a spider symbol on his chest.\n\nVenom's only known weakness is electricity, and larger amounts of the suit will need more electricity to kill, as varying amounts of the suit will be stunned or vaporized by electric shocks. This was first seen in ''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #38, when an electric wire got tangled around Venom's foot. An electrocution from live power-lines vaporised the smaller amount on Peter, while a similar amount disabled Eddie. Note in the video game ''Ultimate Spider-Man'', when [[Electro (Marvel Comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Electro]] electrocutes Venom during a cutscene, the suit is not affected by the shock like the live power-line did in the \"Venom\" arc. The suit can take the [[Shocker (comics)#Ultimate Marvel|Shocker]]'s vibro-shocks, and can protect its host from a bullet, who feels nothing more than a relaxing vibration. When worn by a host other than Richard's son Peter, the host is compelled to take the life energy of other human beings or else have their own be consumed by the suit instead. The original Spider-Man (Peter Parker) was able to control the suit to a greater extent than anyone because of his powers and because the suit was designed for his father.<ref>{{Cite comic|writer=Brian Michael Bendis|penciller=Mark Bagley|inker=Art Thibert and Rodney Ramos|colorist=Transparency Digital|letterer=VC's Chris Eliopoulos|editor=Ralph Macchio, Brian Smith, [[C.B.

In the conclusion of ''[[The Alien Costume]]'', Venom is defeated by Spider-Man and sent into space, however [[Dormammu]] and [[Baron Mordo]] divert the rocket allowing Venom back to Earth. When Venom fails to get a [[Stark Industries]] portal device for Mordo, they bond Venom's offspring whom Cletus Kasady coins the name Carnage and send him to help Venom. With help from [[Iron Man]], Eddie Brock willingly separates from Venom, after having a change of heart. When Carnage kidnaps [[Ashley Kafka]] whom Eddie is in love with Eddie rejoins with the symbiote and helps Spider-Man, Iron Man and [[War Machine (comics)|War Machine]]. When Carnage attempts to throw Kafka into limbo, the place between portals, Venom stops him and knocks them both into limbo, foiling Dormannu's plans for good. During the ''[[Spider Wars]]'' season finale, Carnage bonds with an alternate dejected Spider-Man to create [[Spider Carnage]].\n* In ''[[Spider-Man Unlimited]]'', Venom and Carnage are primary villains, who in the pilot episode board a shuttle piloted by [[John Jameson (comics)|John Jameson]] for [[Counter-Earth]] to start a new empire of Symbiotes. Here the symbiotes are more [[amorphous]] creatures that rely on stretching bodies then webbing, and are more exaggerated such as Carnage sporting spikes. The in-universe explanation is that the Symbiotes have bonded completely with their hosts, although under the Synoptic's guide Venom & Carnage learned their shapeshifting abilities (into liquid, etc.) as Spidey referred to that as \"new powers\". \n* Venom appears in ''[[The Spectacular Spider-Man (TV series)|The Spectacular Spider-Man]]'', with Spider-Man's version voiced by [[Josh Keaton]], and Eddie Brock's version voiced by [[Benjamin Diskin]]. In the episode \"The Uncertainly Principle\", the Symbiote arrives on Earth by stowing away on the [[space shuttle]]. After being rejected by Spider-Man, it bonds with Eddie in the episode \"Intervention\", and is ultimately defeated in the episode \"Nature vs. Nurture\". Venom reappeared in the Season Two episodes \"First Steps\", \"Growing Pains\", and \"Identity Crisis\", where he attempts to expose Spider-Man's secret identity but his plans are foiled. Carnage was also set to appear in the third season.\n* The Venom, Carnage, and Anti-Venom Symbiotes appear in ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (TV series)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]''. Venom and Anti-Venom are created by Doctor Octopus for [[Oscorp]]. Venom was created by altering a sample of Spider-Man's DNA and Anti-Venom was created from the Venom sample used to counter and destroy the Venom Symbiote. The Carnage symbiote is created by Green Goblin and later recreated by [[Morbius, the Living Vampire|Michael Morbius]] of [[Hydra (comics)|HYDRA]] from the Venom symbiote he obtained.\n* In the ''[[Hulk and the Agents of S.M.A.S.H.]]'' episode \"The Venom Within\", Doctor Octopus creates \"Gamma Venom\" by having the Venom Symbiote combine with each members of the Agents of S.M.A.S.H. This version of the Venom Symbiote is destroyed by the Agents of S.M.A.S.H. and Spider-Man.\n* The Symbiotes appear in the animated ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (TV series)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'' series that debuted in 2015. Their origins are revealed in the three-part episode \"Symbiote War\" as originally coming from Klyntar who were altered by [[Thanos]] in his experiments on the mining planet, later revealed to be what remained of Groot's homeworld. The Exolons are also referenced inhabiting [[Wraith (Zak-Del)|Wraith]]'s body.\n* The Venom Symbiote appears in the animated ''[[Spider-Man (2017 TV series)|Spider-Man]]'' series, referred to as the V-252 during the first season before assuming the name Venom in the second season. In this series, Horizon High headmaster [[Max Modell]] acquires the symbiote from the space program in hopes of discovering a new element for the periodic table. The V-252 first appeared in the episode \"A Day in the Life\", in which [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]] steals the symbiote as a means to sell it to the black market, but Spider-Man recaptures and returns the V-252 to Horizon High. He briefly merged with Spider-Man from \"Sandman\" and \"Stark Expo\", and Flash Thompson during \"Venom\". In Season 2, the V-252 merges with Eddie Brock in \"Dead Man's Party\" but is incapacitated by an experimental sonic device in \"Venom Returns\". Venom is eventually reawakened by experimentation that ultimately alters his genealogy, enabling him to survive without the need for a host, yet is defeated by Spider-Man shortly after Otto Octavius undoes their body-swap in \"Superior\". In Season 3, subtitled ''Maximum Venom'', Venom sends an extension of himself to unleash a weapon that ultimately summons more symbiotes to Earth from his home planet in the two-part episode \"Web of Venom\".\n\n=== Film ===\n==== Sam Raimi film series ====\n{{Main|Spider-Man in film #Sam Raimi films}}\nThe [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]] symbiote appears in ''[[Spider-Man 3]]''. In this version, instead of brought to Earth in a human spaceship, it came from space after it landed on Earth inside a [[meteorite]]. The symbiote fused with the sleeping [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker / Spider-Man]]'s suit enhancing his powers, abilities and his anger. A small is studied and analyzed by [[Lizard (comics)|Curt Conners]]. After being rejected by Parker following the dark influence it had on him at the church when ringing the bell, the alien attaches to [[Eddie Brock]] ([[Topher Grace]]). Later, both are killed in an explosion at the climax. A spin-off film about Venom was planned after the release of ''Spider-Man 3'', but was cancelled.\n\n==== Marc Webb films ====\n{{Main|Spider-Man in film #Marc Webb films}}\nIn trailers for ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man 2]]'', the Venom symbiote appeared briefly among various elements of supervillain technology seen in the [[Gentleman (comics)|Gustav Fiers / The Gentleman]]'s agency. In the final cut of the film the symbiote was replaced by the Rhino's armor as Richard Parker has a strong connection with Oscorp's Special Projects equipment used by many Spider-Man villains. Sony Pictures had plans to create a Spider-Man [[Shared fictional universe|cinematic universe]] with various spin-off films including a ''Venom'' film, but those plans were abandoned following the studio agreement reached with [[Marvel Studios]].\n\n==== Marvel Cinematic Universe ====\n* In ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'', the Exolons are referenced via the Exolon Monks, who serve [[Ronan the Accuser]].<ref>{{cite comic|writer=Mike O'Sullivan, Rob Bock, Anthoney Cotilletta, Pat Duke, Mike Fichera, Daron Jensen, Rob London, Chris McCarver, Jacob Rougemont and Stuart Vandal|penciller=Wellinton Alves, Simone Bianchi, Nick Bradshaw, Sal Buscema, John Byrne, Roberto Castro, Paul Catling, Jim Cheung, Gene Colan, Gabriele Dell'Otto, Steve Ditko, Andrea Di Vito, Jack Dudman, Anthony Francisco, Javier Garr\u00f3n, Adi Granov, Bob Hall, Scott Hepburn, Dave Johnson, Gil Kane, Jack Kirby, Nic Klein, Jos\u00e9 Ladr\u00f6nn, Bob Larkin, Aaron Lopresti, Jorge Lucas, Chris Marrinan, Francesco Mattina, Mike Mayhew, Steve McNiven, Gray Morrow, Rudy Nebres, Ariel Olivetti, Paul Pelletier, George P\u00e9rez, Keith Pollard, Olivier Pron, Joe Quinones and Humberto Ramos|title=Guidebook to the Marvel Cinematic Universe - Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy|issue=1|date=September 2016|editor=Mark D.

All the clones can be killed, but there is one \"prime clone\" with much more life. Defeating this clone is the only way to win.\n* In the 2000 video game ''[[Spider-Man (2000 video game)|Spider-Man]]'', the symbiotes become the more common enemy after the player rescues [[Mary Jane Watson|Mary Jane]] from Venom and heads back to the ''[[Daily Bugle]]''. The fastest way to kill these symbiotes is to find a fire-imbued web cartridge. It is revealed at the end of the game, that [[Doctor Octopus]] and Carnage planned to unleash the symbiotes on all of humanity and rule a new world order, but their plan is foiled by Spider-Man and Venom.\n* The symbiote family are major characters in the video game ''[[Venom/Spider-Man: Separation Anxiety]]''.\n* Venom appears as the final boss in ''[[Spider-Man: The Animated Series (video game)|Spider-Man: The Animated Series]]''.\n* Venom appears in the ''[[Ultimate Spider-Man (video game)|Ultimate Spider-Man]]'' video game (for Game Boy Advance) as a playable character and the final boss. Carnage also appears and serves as the game's penultimate boss.\n* Venom is a playable character in ''[[Marvel Nemesis: Rise of the Imperfects]]''.\n* In the ''[[Spider-Man 3 (video game)|Spider-Man 3]]'' video game, the black-suited Spider-Man is playable for a large portion of the game, until removing the symbiote, which attaches to Eddie Brock instead; Venom then serves as the game's final boss, where he is killed after being impaled on some steel bars, although it is possible that the symbiote survived. The [[PlayStation 2]], [[PlayStation Portable]] and [[Wii]] versions of the game also feature the character [[Shriek (character)|Shriek]], whose powers come from a symbiote in this game which is also black in color. However, the symbiote only covers half of her body,\n* In ''[[Spider-Man: Web of Shadows]]'', Venom returns to New York. During a fight with Venom, the Symbiote suddenly reproduces and the spawn bonds with Spider-Man creating a replica of the Black Suit, but with considerably more Carnage-like abilities such as projecting bladed tentacles. Over the course of the game, Venom creates symbiote \"seed-pods\" in various locations around the city which absorb passing civilians and infect them with various types of symbiote ranging from '''Snatcher Symbiotes''' (the small black Symbiotes that drag unsuspecting victims to the \"seed-pods\"), '''Zombie Symbiotes''' (the weak white Symbiotes), '''Berserker Symbiotes''' (the red shiny Symbiotes), '''Grappler Symbiotes''' (black and red versions of the Berserkers), and '''Slasher Symbiotes''' (the white and pink Symbiotes). The Symbiotes even manage to infect [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]], [[Vulture (Marvel Comics)|Vulture]], [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]] and [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]]. Symbiote-Electro and Symbiote-Vulture go on to spawn other symbiotes with powers similar to their hosts resulting in '''Electrolings''' and '''Vulturelings'''. All are eventually defeated by Spider-Man and the symbiotes are separated from them.\n* In ''[[Spider-Man: Shattered Dimensions]]'', the Ultimate Marvel version of Spider-Man in his symbiote suit is a playable character. [[Madame Web]] had restored the black suit as it provides this world's Peter Parker with additional abilities that he will require to succeed in his mission, while she uses her psychic abilities to prevent the suit attempting to take over his mind. However, Madame Web's abilities do not seem to be absolute, as Ultimate Spider-Man experiences occasional bouts of anger. Also, the Ultimate version of Carnage appears as the final boss in the Ultimate levels where it was granted the ability to reanimate its victims into symbiotic zombie-like creatures thanks to the powers of a fragment of the Tablet of Order and Chaos when S.H.I.E.L.D. are foolishly mixing the fragment with Carnage.\n* In ''[[Spider-Man: Edge of Time]]'', it is revealed that the brainwashed Anti-Venom is responsible for killing present-day [[Spider-Man]], altering the future of the ''[[Marvel 2099]]'' timeline and prompting [[Spider-Man 2099]] to tamper with the timeline further in order to save his predecessor's life and repair the timestream. In one of their battles, Anti-Venom, Doctor Octopus (who in the new timeline was never a villain, but still uses his trademark arms) and game exclusive villain Dr. Walker Sloan (the man from 2099 who tried to alter the timeline) are knocked into a portal and become '''Atrocity''' (vocal effects provided by [[Fred Tatasciore]]), a bloated version of Anti-Venom with tentacles. Both Atrocity and the future Peter Parker are defeated with the time resetting presumably separating Atrocity back into Walker Sloan, Anti-Venom, and Doctor Octopus.\n* Two versions of the black suit appear as an optional costume in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man (2012 video game)|The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' video game, based on its appearance in the ''Spider-Man 3'' film, and a modified version of Spider-Man's costume from ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' film. Backstory for the game also reveals that the game version of the Symbiote is based on a \"black goo\" recovered from space and that it is bonded with the game's version of the Scorpion. This is an allusion to the comics, where Mac Gargan briefly assumed the role of Venom.\n* In ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man 2]]'', a version of Venom exists in the secret [[Oscorp]] experiment run in [[Ravencroft]] called \"The Venom Project\", using [[nanites]] as a regenerating body armor. It is used on notorious serial killer Cletus Kasady, which transforms him into Carnage under the direction of [[Donald Menken]] and [[Kingpin (character)|Kingpin]].\n* Symbiote Scientists appear in ''[[Lego Marvel Super Heroes]]''.\n* Various Symbiote characters are featured in the mobile game ''[[Spider-Man Unlimited (video game)|Spider-Man Unlimited]]'' with the Symbiote World featured as a level.\n* Various Symbiotes appear in the [[Facebook]] game ''[[Marvel: Avengers Alliance]]'': [[Mac Gargan|Venom]], [[Flash Thompson|Agent Venom]], [[Eddie Brock|Anti-Venom]], [[Scream (comics)|Scream]] and [[Hybrid (Scott Washington)|Hybrid]].\n* Symbiotes \"connect together\" in a ''[[Marvel Puzzle Quest]]'' storyline. Besides Mac Gargan and Eddie Brock as Venom and Cletus Kasady's Carnage, there are four new Symbiotes: A green male named '''Carrier''', an orange female named '''Horror''', a teal teethy creature named '''Demolisher''', and a magenta dog-like creature named '''Mutation'''.\n* In ''[[Marvel Avengers Academy]]'', the symbiotes appear which were taken from their home planet by Oscorp. Spider-Man tried to save the symbiotes, but got bonded to them and then they tried to take over the Academy. They failed, but decided to remain on Earth.\n* The Symbiotes appears in ''[[Marvel vs. Capcom Infinite]]''. In the game's story, [[Jedah Dohma]] uses the [[Infinity Gems|Soul Stone]] to steal a million souls from Earth and feed them to a Giant Symbiote, planning to strengthen it and use it as a weapon against [[Ultron]] [[Sigma (Mega Man X)|Sigma]]. He gives pieces of the symbiotes to [[Advanced Idea Mechanics|A.I.M.]][[Umbrella Corp|brella]] to bond the pieces to virus-infected subjects to stabilize them. In a battle against Jedah the heroes are successful, but then he unleashes the creature on the New Metro City. When [[Chris Redfield]] tries attacking it, he accidentally causes part of the symbiote to bond to Spider-Man, forcing the latter to fight against [[Frank West (Dead Rising)|Frank West]] and [[Mike Haggar]] against his will (though the symbiote is removed after Frank causes some car alarms to go off). The creature is unleashed on New Metro City, but is destroyed by the heroes using three of the Infinity Stones. Venom also appears as a playable character via [[downloadable content]].\n* In the 2018 ''[[Spider-Man (2018 video game)|Spider-Man]]'' video game, during a conversation between Spider-Man and [[Yuri Watanabe]], she quickly ask Spider-Man as a joke if he has a black and white suit indicating that Spider-Man at some point had a black suit but he got rid of it. In the post credit scene [[Norman Osborn]] goes into a secret lab inside his house where it shows his son [[Harry Osborn]], inside a chamber labeled G-35 with black web-like substance attached to his body. When Spider-Man looks through certain windows there is a few collectibles on a shelf, including a black suit Spider-Man figure.\n* In the 2014 fighting video game ''[[Marvel: Contest of Champions]]'', the '''Symbioids''' are symbiotes merged with the [[Super-Adaptoid|Adaptioids]]. Venom, Carnage and Agent Venom appear as playable characters. Also featured are also '''VenomPool''' (amalgamation of [[Deadpool]] and Venom), '''Venom the Duck''' (amalgamation of [[Howard the Duck]] and Venom) and '''Symbiote Supreme''' (amalgamation of [[Doctor Strange]] and Venom).\n\n=== Attractions ===\n* [[Scream (comics)|Scream]] appears as one of the villains in [[Universal Orlando]]'s [[Islands of Adventure]] ''[[The Amazing Adventures of Spider-Man]]'' ride.\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n*[http://www.thevenomsite.com List of Venom Comics] at TheVenomSite.com\n*{{Marveldatabase|Klyntar_(Race)|Klyntar}}\n*[https://comicvine.gamespot.com/symbiotes/4060-56880/characters/ Symbiotes] at Comic Vine\n*[https://m.ign.com/articles/2018/10/19/venom-movie-marvels-most-powerful-symbiotes-ranked Marvel's most powerful symbiotes] at IGN\n*[https://screenrant.com/symbiotes-stronger-weaker-venom/ 16 Symbiotes More Powerful Than Venom (And 9 Weaker)] at Screenrant\n*[https://m.ranker.com/list/the-real-comic-book-origin-of-venom/stephanroget The Real Origin Story Of The Venom Symbiote Is Much More Complicated Than You Think] at Ranker\n\n{{Symbiote Family and Hosts}}\n{{Navboxes\n|title=Related topics to Symbiotes\n|list1=\n{{Spider-Man characters}}\n{{Eddie Brock}}\n{{Ultimate Spider-Man}}\n{{Skrull}}\n{{Guardians of the Galaxy}}\n{{Galactus}}\n{{Marvel Comics deities}}\n{{Avengers}}\n{{X-Men}}\n{{Goblin (Marvel Comics)}}\n{{S.H.I.E.L.D.}}\n{{Marvel Cosmic}}\n}}\n\n[[Category:Venom (Marvel Comics)]]\n[[Category:Fictional amorphous creatures]]\n[[Category:Fictional parasites and parasitoids]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Roger Stern]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Tom DeFalco]]\n[[Category:Characters created by David Michelinie]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Mike Zeck]]\n[[Category:Marvel Comics alien species]]\n[[Category:Hive minds in fiction]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters who can duplicate themselves]]\n[[Category:Fictional superorganisms]]\n", "name_user": "5.121.151.128", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symbiote_(comics)"}

London: [[George Newnes]], 1961, Vol.&nbsp;1, p.&nbsp;497.</ref> but the derivation of this name is uncertain. The traditional etymology is from the verb ''aperire'', \"to open\", in allusion to its being the season when trees and flowers begin to \"open\", which is supported by comparison with the modern Greek use of [[wikt:\u03ac\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9\u03be\u03b7#Greek|\u03ac\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9\u03be\u03b7]] (''\u00e1nixi'') (opening) for spring. Since some of the Roman months were named in honor of divinities, and as April was sacred to the goddess [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]], her [[Veneralia]] being held on the first day, it has been suggested that Aprilis was originally her month '''Aphrilis''', from her equivalent Greek goddess name [[Aphrodite]] (''Aphros''), or from the [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]] name ''[[Aphrodite|Apru]]''. [[Jacob Grimm]] suggests the name of a hypothetical god or hero, ''Aper'' or ''Aprus''.<ref>Jacob Grim ''Geschichte der deutschen Sprache''. Cap. \"Monate\"</ref>\n\nApril was the second month of the earliest [[Roman calendar]],<ref name=\"Chisholm1911\"/> before ''[[Ianuarius]]'' and ''[[Februarius]]'' were added by King [[Numa Pompilius]] about 700&nbsp;BC. It became the fourth month of the calendar year (the year when twelve months are displayed in order) during the time of the [[decemvirs]] about 450&nbsp;BC, when it also was given 29&nbsp;days. The 30th day was added during the reform of the calendar undertaken by [[Julius Caesar]] in the mid-40s&nbsp;BC, which produced the Julian calendar.\n\nThe [[Anglo-Saxons]] called April ''\u0113astre-mona\u00fe''. The [[Venerable Bede]] says in ''[[The Reckoning of Time]]'' that this month ''\u0113astre'' is the root of the word [[Easter]]. He further states that the month was named after a goddess ''[[Eostre]]'' whose feast was in that month. It is also attested by [[Einhard]] in his work, [[Vita Karoli Magni]].\n\n[[St George]]'s day is the twenty-third of the month; and [[St Mark]]'s Eve, with its superstition that the ghosts of those who are doomed to die within the year will be seen to pass into the church, falls on the twenty-fourth.<ref name=\"Chisholm1911\">{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=April|volume=2|page=230}}</ref>\n\nIn [[History of China|China]] the symbolic ploughing of the earth by the emperor and princes of the blood took place in their third month, which frequently corresponds to April.<ref name=\"Chisholm1911\"/> In Finnish April is ''huhtikuu'', meaning ''[[slash-and-burn]] moon'', when [[gymnosperm]]s for beat and burn clearing of farmland were felled.\n\nIn [[Slovene language|Slovene]], the most established traditional name is ''mali traven'', meaning the month when plants start growing. It was first written in 1466 in the [[\u0160kofja Loka manuscript]].<ref name=\"KoledarDPG2007\">{{cite journal|url=http://www.dobrova-polhovgradec.si/doc/priponke/koledar%20prir%2007%20zadnji.pdf |title=Koledar prireditev v letu 2007 in druge informacije ob\u010dine Dobrova\u2013Polhov Gradec |language=Slovenian |trans-title=The Calendar of Events and Other Information of the Municipality of Dobrova\u2013Polhov Gradec <!-- |issn=C505-5857 --> |publisher=Municipality of Dobrova-Polhov Gradec |year=2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102060918/http://www.dobrova-polhovgradec.si/doc/priponke/koledar%20prir%2007%20zadnji.pdf |archivedate=November 2, 2013 }}</ref>\n\nThe month Aprilis had 30&nbsp;days; [[Numa Pompilius]] made it 29&nbsp;days long; finally [[Julius Caesar]]\u2019s calendar reform made it again 30&nbsp;days long, which was not changed in the calendar revision of [[Julian calendar|Augustus Caesar]] in 8&nbsp;BC. Additionally in the Spanish colony, Las Islas Filipinas (now known as the Philippines), the month Aprilis had a significant meaning to the life of the natives as it was associated to the influence of the Chinese during the Spanish colonial period. The importance of this aspect to the lives of the natives was formerly associated to an event called \"Abril na Ikaw\" as it is closely linked to the famous trader, April Yu.\n\nIn [[Ancient Rome]], the festival of [[Cerealia]] was held for seven days from mid-to-late April, but exact dates are uncertain. [[Feriae Latinae]] was also held in April, with the date varying. Other ancient Roman observances include [[Veneralia]] (April 1), [[Megalesia]] (April 10\u201316), [[Fordicidia]] (April 15), [[Parilia]] (April 21), [[Vinalia|Vinalia Urbana]], [[Robigalia]], and [[Serapia]] were celebrated on (April 25). [[Floralia]] was held April 27 during the [[Roman Republic|Republican era]], or April 28 on the [[Julian calendar]], and lasted until May 3. However, these dates do not correspond to the modern [[Gregorian calendar]].\n\nThe [[Lyrids]] [[meteor shower]] appears on April 16 \u2013 April 26 each year, with the peak generally occurring on April 22. [[Eta Aquariids]] meteor shower also appears in April. It is visible from about April 21 to about May 20 each year with peak activity on or around May 6. The [[Pi Puppids]] appear on April 23, but only in years around the parent comet's [[perihelion]] date. The [[Virginids]] also shower at various dates in April.\n\nThe \"Days of April\" (''journ\u00e9es d'avril'') is a name appropriated in French history to a [[July Monarchy#April 1834 insurrections|series of insurrections]] at Lyons, Paris and elsewhere, against the government of [[Louis-Philippe of France|Louis Philippe]] in 1834, which led to violent repressive measures, and to a famous trial known as the ''proc\u00e8s d'avril''.<ref name=\"Chisholm1911\"/>\n\n==April symbols==\n*[[File:Irish diamond.JPG|alt=Diamond crystals|thumb|[[Diamond]] crystals]][[File:Diamond.jpg|alt=Faceted diamond|thumb|Faceted diamond]]April's [[Birthstones|birthstone]] is the [[diamond (gemstone)|diamond]].\n*[[File:Daisy ntgr.JPG|alt=Daisy flower|thumb|[[Bellis perennis|Daisy]] flower]][[File:Sweet Pea (27711557850).jpg|alt=Sweet pea|thumb|[[Sweet pea]]]]The [[Birthday#Birth flowers|birth flower]] is typically listed as either the [[Common Daisy|Daisy]] ''(Bellis perennis)'' or the [[Sweet pea|Sweet Pea]].<ref>Kipfer, Barbara Ann (1997) ''The Order of Things.''

London: [[George Newnes]], 1961, Vol.&nbsp;1, p.&nbsp;497.</ref> but the derivation of this name is uncertain. The traditional etymology is from the verb ''aperire'', \"to open\", in allusion to its being the season when trees and flowers begin to \"open\", which is supported by comparison with the modern Greek use of [[wikt:\u03ac\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9\u03be\u03b7#Greek|\u03ac\u03bd\u03bf\u03b9\u03be\u03b7]] (''\u00e1nixi'') (opening) for spring. Since some of the Roman months were named in honor of divinities, and as April was sacred to the goddess [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]], her [[Veneralia]] being held on the first day, it has been suggested that Aprilis was originally her month '''Aphrilis''', from her equivalent Greek goddess name [[Aphrodite]] (''Aphros''), or from the [[Etruscan language|Etruscan]] name ''[[Aphrodite|Apru]]''. [[Jacob Grimm]] suggests the name of a hypothetical god or hero, ''Aper'' or ''Aprus''.<ref>Jacob Grim ''Geschichte der deutschen Sprache''. Cap. \"Monate\"</ref>\n\nApril was the second month of the earliest [[Roman calendar]],<ref name=\"Chisholm1911\"/> before ''[[Ianuarius]]'' and ''[[Februarius]]'' were added by King [[Numa Pompilius]] about 700&nbsp;BC. It became the fourth month of the calendar year (the year when twelve months are displayed in order) during the time of the [[decemvirs]] about 450&nbsp;BC, when it also was given 29&nbsp;days. The 30th day was added during the reform of the calendar undertaken by [[Julius Caesar]] in the mid-40s&nbsp;BC, which produced the Julian calendar.\n\nThe [[Anglo-Saxons]] called April ''\u0113astre-mona\u00fe''. The [[Venerable Bede]] says in ''[[The Reckoning of Time]]'' that this month ''\u0113astre'' is the root of the word [[Easter]]. He further states that the month was named after a goddess ''[[Eostre]]'' whose feast was in that month. It is also attested by [[Einhard]] in his work, [[Vita Karoli Magni]].\n\n[[St George]]'s day is the twenty-third of the month; and [[St Mark]]'s Eve, with its superstition that the ghosts of those who are doomed to die within the year will be seen to pass into the church, falls on the twenty-fourth.<ref name=\"Chisholm1911\">{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=April|volume=2|page=230}}</ref>\n\nIn [[History of China|China]] the symbolic ploughing of the earth by the emperor and princes of the blood took place in their third month, which frequently corresponds to April.<ref name=\"Chisholm1911\"/> In Finnish April is ''huhtikuu'', meaning ''[[slash-and-burn]] moon'', when [[gymnosperm]]s for beat and burn clearing of farmland were felled.\n\nIn [[Slovene language|Slovene]], the most established traditional name is ''mali traven'', meaning the month when plants start growing. It was first written in 1466 in the [[\u0160kofja Loka manuscript]].<ref name=\"KoledarDPG2007\">{{cite journal|url=http://www.dobrova-polhovgradec.si/doc/priponke/koledar%20prir%2007%20zadnji.pdf |title=Koledar prireditev v letu 2007 in druge informacije ob\u010dine Dobrova\u2013Polhov Gradec |language=Slovenian |trans-title=The Calendar of Events and Other Information of the Municipality of Dobrova\u2013Polhov Gradec <!-- |issn=C505-5857 --> |publisher=Municipality of Dobrova-Polhov Gradec |year=2006 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102060918/http://www.dobrova-polhovgradec.si/doc/priponke/koledar%20prir%2007%20zadnji.pdf |archivedate=November 2, 2013 }}</ref>\n\nThe month Aprilis had 30&nbsp;days; [[Numa Pompilius]] made it 29&nbsp;days long; finally [[Julius Caesar]]\u2019s calendar reform made it again 30&nbsp;days long, which was not changed in the calendar revision of [[Julian calendar|Augustus Caesar]] in 8&nbsp;BC. Additionally in the Spanish colony, Las Islas Filipinas (now known as the Philippines), the month Aprilis had a significant meaning to the life of the natives as it was associated to the influence of the Chinese during the Spanish colonial period. The importance of this aspect to the lives of the natives was formerly associated to an event called \"Abril na Ikaw\" as it is closely linked to the famous trader, April Yu.\n\nIn [[Ancient Rome]], the festival of [[Cerealia]] was held for seven days from mid-to-late April, but exact dates are uncertain. [[Feriae Latinae]] was also held in April, with the date varying. Other ancient Roman observances include [[Veneralia]] (April 1), [[Megalesia]] (April 10\u201316), [[Fordicidia]] (April 15), [[Parilia]] (April 21), [[Vinalia|Vinalia Urbana]], [[Robigalia]], and [[Serapia]] were celebrated on (April 25). [[Floralia]] was held April 27 during the [[Roman Republic|Republican era]], or April 28 on the [[Julian calendar]], and lasted until May 3. However, these dates do not correspond to the modern [[Gregorian calendar]].\n\nThe [[Lyrids]] [[meteor shower]] appears on April 16 \u2013 April 26 each year, with the peak generally occurring on April 22. [[Eta Aquariids]] meteor shower also appears in April. It is visible from about April 21 to about May 20 each year with peak activity on or around May 6. The [[Pi Puppids]] appear on April 23, but only in years around the parent comet's [[perihelion]] date. The [[Virginids]] also shower at various dates in April.\n\nThe \"Days of April\" (''journ\u00e9es d'avril'') is a name appropriated in French history to a [[July Monarchy#April 1834 insurrections|series of insurrections]] at Lyons, Paris and elsewhere, against the government of [[Louis-Philippe of France|Louis Philippe]] in 1834, which led to violent repressive measures, and to a famous trial known as the ''proc\u00e8s d'avril''.<ref name=\"Chisholm1911\"/>\n\n==April symbols==\n*[[File:Irish diamond.JPG|alt=Diamond crystals|thumb|[[Diamond]] crystals]][[File:Diamond.jpg|alt=Faceted diamond|thumb|Faceted diamond]]April's [[Birthstones|birthstone]] is the [[diamond (gemstone)|diamond]].\n*[[File:Daisy ntgr.JPG|alt=Daisy flower|thumb|[[Bellis perennis|Daisy]] flower]][[File:Sweet Pea (27711557850).jpg|alt=Sweet pea|thumb|[[Sweet pea]]]]The [[Birthday#Birth flowers|birth flower]] is typically listed as either the [[Common Daisy|Daisy]] ''(Bellis perennis)'' or the [[Sweet pea|Sweet Pea]].<ref>Kipfer, Barbara Ann (1997) ''The Order of Things.''

Both [[proprioception]] and [[interoception]] allow individuals to be consciously aware of various sensations.<ref>{{Cite pmc=2680990}}</ref> [[Proprioception]] allows individuals and patients to focus on sensations in their muscles and joints, posture, and balance, while [[interoception]] is used to determine sensations of the internal organs, such as fluctuating heartbeat, respiration, lung pain, or satiety. Over-acute body-awareness, under-acute body-awareness, and distorted body-awareness are symptoms present in a variety of health disorders and conditions, such as [[obesity]], [[anorexia nervosa]], and chronic joint pain.<ref>Body Awareness in Anorexia Nervosa: Disturbances in \"Body Image\" and \"Satiety\"</ref> For example, a distorted perception of satiety present in a patient suffering from [[anorexia nervosa]]\n\n====Human development====\nBodily self-awareness in human development refers to one's awareness of their body as a physical object, with physical properties, that can interact with other objects. Tests have shown that at the age of only a few months old, toddlers are already aware of the relationship between the proprioceptive and visual information they receive.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Moore|first=Chris|last2=Mealiea|first2=Jennifer|last3=Garon|first3=Nancy|last4=Povinelli|first4=Daniel J.|date=2007-03-01|title=The Development of Body Self-Awareness|journal=Infancy|language=en|volume=11|issue=2|pages=157\u2013174|doi=10.1111/j.1532-7078.2007.tb00220.x|issn=1532-7078}}</ref> This is called first-person self-awareness.\n\nAt around 18 months old and later, children begin to develop reflective self-awareness, which is the next stage of bodily awareness and involves children recognizing themselves in reflections, mirrors, and pictures.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Brownell|first=Celia A.|last2=Zerwas|first2=Stephanie|last3=Ramani|first3=Geetha B.|date=2007-09-01|title=\"So Big\": The Development of Body Self-Awareness in Toddlers|journal=Child Development|language=en|volume=78|issue=5|pages=1426\u20131440|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.2007.01075.x|pmid=17883440|issn=1467-8624|pmc=3351035}}</ref> Children who have not obtained this stage of bodily self-awareness yet will tend to view reflections of themselves as other children and respond accordingly, as if they were looking at someone else face to face. In contrast, those who have reached this level of awareness will recognize that they see themselves, for instance seeing dirt on their face in the reflection and then touching their own face to wipe it off.\n\nSlightly after toddlers become reflectively self-aware, they begin to develop the ability to recognize their bodies as physical objects in time and space that interact and impact other objects. For instance, a toddler placed on a blanket, when asked to hand someone the blanket, will recognize that they need to get off it to be able to lift it.<ref name=\":1\" /> This is the final stage of body self-awareness and is called objective self-awareness.\n\n===Animals===\n[[File:NICO looks at himself.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[mirror test]] is a simple measure of self-awareness.]]\n{{see also|Animal consciousness|Mirror test}}\n\nStudies have been done mainly on [[primate]]s to test if self-awareness is present. [[Ape]]s, [[monkey]]s, [[elephant]]s, and [[dolphin]]s have been studied most frequently. The most relevant studies to this day that represent self-awareness in animals have been done on [[chimpanzee]]s, dolphins, and [[magpie]]s. Self-awareness in animals is tested through mirror self-recognition.\n\nAnimals that show mirror self-recognition undergo four stages:\n# social response,\n# physical mirror inspection,\n# repetitive mirror testing behavior, and\n# the mark test, which involves the animals spontaneously touching a mark on their body which would have been difficult to see without the mirror.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Plotnik |last2=Waal |last3=Reiss |first1=Joshua |first2=Frans |first3=Diana |title=Self recognition in an Asian elephant |journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the USA]] |doi=10.1073/pnas.0608062103 |pmid=17075063 |volume=103 |issue=45 |pages=17053\u201357 |year=2006 |pmc=1636577}}</ref>\n\n[[David DeGrazia]] states that there are three types of self-awareness in animals; the first being, bodily self-awareness. This sense of awareness allows animals to understand that they are different from the rest of the environment; it is also the reason why animals do not eat themselves. Bodily-awareness also includes [[proprioception]] and [[sensation (psychology)|sensation]]. The second type of self-awareness in animals is, social self-awareness. This type of awareness is seen in highly social animals and is the awareness that they have a role within themselves in order to survive. This type of awareness allows animals to interact with each other. The final type of self-awareness is introspective awareness. This awareness is responsible for animals to understand feelings, desires, and beliefs.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://escuelaycomunidad.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/De-Grazia-Self-Awareness-in-Animals.pdf |title=Self-awareness in animals}}</ref>\n\nThe [[mirror test|red-spot technique]] created and experimented by [[Gordon G.

In this technique, a red odorless spot is placed on an anesthetized primate's forehead. The spot is placed on the forehead so that it can only be seen through a mirror. Once the individual awakens, independent movements toward the spot after seeing their reflection in a mirror are observed. During the red-spot technique, after looking in the mirror, chimpanzees used their fingers to touch the red dot that was on their forehead and, after touching the red dot they would even smell their fingertips.<ref name=\"Reference 4\">{{cite journal |last1=Gallup Jr |first1=GG |last2=Anderson |first2=JR |last3=Shillito |first3=DJ |title=The mirror test.

Another prime example are elephants. Three elephants were exposed to large mirrors where experimenters studied the reaction when the elephants saw their reflection.

As a majority of birds are blind below the beak, Prior et al.<ref name=\"Reference 6\" /> marked the birds\u2019 neck with three different colors: red, yellow, and black (as an imitation, as magpies are originally black). When placed in front of a mirror, the birds with the red and yellow spots began scratching at their necks, signaling the understanding of something different being on their bodies. During one trial with a mirror and a mark, three out of the five magpies showed a minimum of one example of self-directed behavior. The magpies explored the mirror by moving toward it and looking behind it. One of the magpies, Harvey, during several trials would pick up objects, pose, do some wing-flapping, all in front of the mirror with the objects in his beak. This represents a sense of self-awareness; knowing what is going on within himself and in the present. The authors suggest that self-recognition in birds and mammals may be a case of [[convergent evolution]], where similar evolutionary pressures result in similar behaviors or traits, although they arrive at them via different routes.<ref name=\"PLoS Biology (DOI:10.1371/journal.pbio.0060202)\">{{cite journal |last=Alison |first=Motluk |title=Mirror test shows magpies aren't so bird-brained |journal=[[New Scientist]] |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn14552-mirror-test-shows-magpies-arent-so-birdbrained.html#.VHVdHf4tDIV |access-date=26 November 2014}}</ref>\n\nA few slight occurrences of behavior towards the magpie's own body happened in the trial with the black mark and the mirror.

This by simple reactions to specific situations which happens to benefit other individuals in the organism's natural environment. If self-awareness led to a necessity of an emotional empathy mechanism for altruism and egoism being default in its absence, that would have precluded [[evolution]] from a state without self-awareness to a self-aware state in all [[social animal]]s. The ability of the theory of evolution to explain self-awareness can be rescued by abandoning the hypothesis of self-awareness being a basis for cruelty.<ref>How the Body Shapes the Way We Think: A New View of Intelligence, Rolf Pfeifer, Josh Bongard October 2006</ref><ref>The Unpredictable Species: What Makes Humans Unique, Lieberman, P 2013</ref>\n\n==Psychology==\nSelf-awareness has been called \"arguably the most fundamental issue in psychology, from both a developmental and an evolutionary perspective.\"<ref name=\"Rochat 2003 717\u2013731\"/>\n\nSelf-awareness theory, developed by Duval and Wicklund in their 1972 landmark book ''A theory of objective self awareness'', states that when we focus our attention on ourselves, we evaluate and compare our current behavior to our internal standards and values.

It is \"the belief in one's capabilities to organize and execute the courses of action required to manage prospective situations.\" A person's belief in their ability to succeed sets the stage to how they think, behave and feel. Someone with a strong self-efficacy, for example, views challenges as mere tasks that must be overcome, and are not easily discouraged by setbacks. They are aware of their flaws and abilities and choose to utilize these qualities to the best of their ability. Someone with a weak sense of self-efficacy evades challenges and quickly feels discouraged by setbacks. They may not be aware of these negative reactions, and therefore do not always change their attitude. This concept is central to Bandura's social cognitive theory, \"which emphasizes the role of observational learning, social experience, and reciprocal determinism in the development of personality.\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Cherry|first1=Kendra|title=What is Self-efficacy?|url=http://psychology.about.com/od/theoriesofpersonality/a/self_efficacy.htm|website=psychology.about.com}}</ref>\n\n===Developmental stages===\nIndividuals become conscious of themselves through the development of self-awareness.<ref name=\"Rochat 2003 717\u2013731\">{{cite journal|last=Rochat|first=Philippe|title=Five levels of self-awareness as they unfold early in life|journal=Consciousness and Cognition|year=2003|volume=12|issue=4|pages=717\u2013731|url=http://psychology.emory.edu/cognition/rochat/Five%20levels%20.pdf|doi=10.1016/s1053-8100(03)00081-3|pmid=14656513}}</ref> This particular type of self-development pertains to becoming conscious of one's own body and mental state of mind including thoughts, actions, ideas, feelings and interactions with others.<ref name=\"Geangu 2008\">{{cite journal |last=Geangu|first=E.|title=Notes on Self-Awareness Development in Early Infancy|journal=Gognitie, Creier, Comportamente|year=2008|volume=12|issue=1|url=http://ns1.fidushost.ro/~devpsych/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/y4t7x_Geangu_ccc_mar2008.pdf}}</ref> \"Self-awareness does not occur suddenly through one particular behavior: it develops gradually through a succession of different behaviors all of which relate to the self.\"<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Bertenthal|first1=B.|author2=Fischer, K.

At this level the individual has a degree of zero self-awareness. This person is unaware of any mirror reflection or the mirror itself. They perceive the mirror as an extension of their environment. Level 0 can also be displayed when an adult frightens himself in a mirror mistaking his own reflection as another person just for a second.\n* Level 1: Differentiation. The individual realizes the mirror is able to reflect things. They see that what is in the mirror is different from what is surrounding them. At this level they can differentiate between their own movement in the mirror and the movement of the surrounding environment.\n* Level 2: Situation. At this point an individual can link the movements on the mirror to what is perceived within their own body. This is the first hint of self-exploration on a projected surface where what is visualized on the mirror is special to the self.\n* Level 3: Identification. This stage is characterized by the new ability to identify self: an individual can now see that what's in the mirror is not another person but actually them. It is seen when a child, instead of referring to the mirror while referring to themselves, refers to themselves while looking in the mirror.\n* Level 4: Permanence. Once an individual reaches this level they can identify the self beyond the present mirror imagery. They are able to identify the self in previous pictures looking different or younger. A \"permanent self\" is now experienced. \n* Level 5: Self-consciousness or \"meta\" self-awareness. At this level not only is the self seen from a first person view but it is realized that it is also seen from a third person's view. They begin to understand they can be in the mind of others. For instance, how they are seen from a public standpoint.<ref name=\"Rochat 2003 717\u2013731\"/>\n\n== Infancy and early childhood ==\nIt is to be kept in mind that as an infant comes into this world, they have no concept of what is around them, nor for the significance of others around them. It is throughout the first year that they gradually begin to acknowledge that their body is actually separate from that of their mother, and that they are an \"active, causal agent in space\". By the end of the first year, they additionally realize that their movement, as well, is separate from movement of the mother. That is a huge advance, yet they are still quite limited and cannot yet know what they look like, \"in the sense that the infant cannot recognize its own face\".<ref name=\":03\">{{cite book |editor1=Thomas D.

For example, in a study, an experimenter took a red marker and put a fairly large red dot (so it is visible by the infant) on the infant's nose, and placed them in front of a mirror. Prior to 15 months of age, the infant will not react to this, but after 15 months of age, they will either touch their nose, wondering what it is they have on their face, or point to it.

At this stage, a child begins to develop interests along with likes and dislikes.

For example, the preschooler will talk about the Los Angeles Lakers basketball team, and the New York Rangers hockey team, instead of the infant just stating that he likes sports. Furthermore, they will start to express certain preferences (e.g., Tod likes mac and cheese) and will start to identify certain possessions of theirs (e.g., Lara has a bird as a pet at home). At this age, the infant is in the stage [[Jean Piaget|Piaget]] names the ''[[Piaget's theory of cognitive development|pre operational]]'' stage of development. The infant is very inaccurate at judging themselves because they do not have much to go about. For example, an infant at this stage will not associate that they are strong with their ability to cross the jungle gym at their school, nor will they associate the fact that they can solve a math problem with their ability to count.<ref name=\":03\" />\n\n==Adolescence==\nOne becomes conscious of their emotions during [[adolescence]].

If consciousness is this \"thought\" which doubles all thoughts, then personal identity is only founded on the repeated act of consciousness: \"This may show us wherein personal identity consists: not in the identity of substance, but ... in the identity of consciousness.\"<ref name=\"What Is Self-Awareness\"/> For example, one may claim to be a [[reincarnation]] of Plato, therefore having the same soul. However, one would be the same [[person]] as Plato only if one had the same consciousness of Plato's thoughts and actions that he himself did. Therefore, self-identity is not based on the soul. One soul may have various personalities.\n\nLocke argues that self-identity is not founded either on the body or the substance, as the substance may change while the person remains the same. \"Animal identity is preserved in identity of life, and not of substance\", as the body of the animal grows and changes during its life.<ref name=\"What Is Self-Awareness\"/> describes a case of a prince and a cobbler in which the soul of the prince is transferred to the body of the cobbler and vice versa. The prince still views himself as a prince, though he no longer looks like one. This border-case leads to the problematic thought that since personal identity is based on consciousness, and that only oneself can be aware of his consciousness, exterior human judges may never know if they really are judging\u2014and punishing\u2014the same person, or simply the same body. Locke argues that one may be judged for the actions of one's body rather than one's soul, and only God knows how to correctly judge a man's actions.  Men also are only responsible for the acts of which they are conscious.

This theory suggests that this happens due to the behavioral inhibitory system which is responsible for self-preservation. This is the system that prevents human from self-harm like jumping out of a speeding bus or putting our hand on a hot stove. Once a dangerous situation is perceived then the behavioral inhibitory system kicks in and restrains our activities. \"For individuals with ASD, this inhibitory mechanism is so powerful, it operates on the least possible trigger and shows an over sensitivity to impending danger and possible threats.<ref name=\"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\"/> Some of these dangers may be perceived as being in the presence of strangers, or a loud noise from a radio. In these situations self-awareness can be compromised due to the desire of self preservation, which trumps social composure and proper interaction.\n \nThe Hobson hypothesis reports that autism begins in infancy due to the lack of cognitive and linguistic engagement which in turn results in impaired reflective self-awareness. In this study ten children with Asperger's Syndrome were examined using the Self-understanding Interview.

Self-awareness and knowledge is not something that can simply be taught through direct instruction. Instead, students acquire this knowledge by interacting with their environment.<ref name=\"legacy.uphs.upenn.edu\"/> Mirror understanding and its relation to the development of self leads to measurable increases in self-awareness in those with ASD. It also proves to be a highly engaging and highly preferred tool in understanding the developmental stages of self- awareness.\n \nThere have been many different theories and studies done on what degree of self-awareness is displayed among people with autism spectrum disorder. Scientists have done research about the various parts of the brain associated with understanding self and self-awareness. Studies have shown evidence of areas of the brain that are impacted by ASD. Other theories suggest that helping an individual learn more about themselves through Joint Activities, such as the Mirror Self Awareness Development may help teach positive self-awareness and growth. In helping to build self-awareness it is also possible to build self-esteem and self acceptance. This in turn can help to allow the individual with ASD to relate better to their environment and have better social interactions with others.\n\n===Schizophrenia===\n{{Main|Schizophrenia}}\nSchizophrenia is a chronic psychiatric illness characterized by excessive dopamine activity in the mesolimbic tract and insufficient dopamine activity in the mesocortical tract leading to symptoms of psychosis along with poor cognition in socialization. Under the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]], people with schizophrenia have a combination of positive, negative and psychomotor symptoms. These cognitive disturbances involve rare beliefs and/or thoughts of a distorted reality that creates an abnormal pattern of functioning for the patient. The cause of schizophrenia has a substantial genetic component [[polygene|involving many genes]]. While the [[heritability]] of schizophrenia has been found to be around 80%, only about 60% of sufferers report a positive [[Family history (medicine)|family history]] of the disorder, and ultimately the cause is thought to be a combination of genetic and environmental factors.<ref name=\"ODonovan_et_al_2003\">{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Donovan MC, Williams NM, Owen MJ | title = Recent advances in the genetics of schizophrenia | journal = Human Molecular Genetics | volume = 12 Spec No 2 | pages = R125\u201333 | date = October 2003 | pmid = 12952866 | doi = 10.1093/hmg/ddg302 | doi-access = free }}</ref> It is believed that the experience of stressful life events is an environmental factor that can trigger the onset of schizophrenia in individuals who already are at risk from genetics and age.<ref name=\"Life Events & Schizophrenia\">{{cite journal |title=Life events and schizophrenia: The \"triggering\" hypothesis |journal=[[Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica]] |date=2007-08-23 |last=Day |first=R. |volume=64 |issue=2 |doi= 10.1111/j.1600-0447.1981.tb00765.x |pages=97\u2013122|pmid=7032227 }}</ref> The level of self-awareness among patients with schizophrenia is a heavily studied topic.\n\nSchizophrenia as a disease state is characterized by severe cognitive dysfunction and it is uncertain to what extent patients are aware of this deficiency.

Results from this study (N=185) revealed large discrepancy in patients\u2019 assessment of their cognitive functioning relative to the assessment of their clinicians. Though it is impossible to access one's consciousness and truly understand what a schizophrenic believes, regardless in this study, patients were not aware of their cognitive dysfunctional reasoning. In the [[DSM-5]], to receive a diagnosis of schizophrenia, they must have two or more of the following symptoms in the duration of one month: delusions*, hallucinations*, disorganized speech*, grossly disorganized/catatonic behavior and negative symptoms (*these three symptoms above all other symptoms must be present to correctly diagnose a patient.) Sometimes these symptoms are very prominent and are treated with a combination of [[antipsychotics]] (i.e. haloperidol, loxapine), atypical antipsychotics (such as clozapine and risperdone) and psychosocial therapies that include family interventions and socials skills. When a patient is undergoing treatment and recovering from the disorder, the memory of their behavior is present in a diminutive amount; thus, self-awareness of diagnoses of schizophrenia after treatment is rare, as well as subsequent to onset and prevalence in the patient.\n\nThe above findings are further supported by a study conducted by Amador and colleagues.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Amador|author2=Lim|title=Assessment of insight in psychosis|journal=American Journal of Psychiatry|year=1993|volume=150|issue=6|pages=873\u2013879|doi=10.1176/ajp.150.6.873|pmid=8494061|citeseerx=10.1.1.457.5515}}</ref> The study suggests a correlation exists between patient insight, compliance, and disease progression. Investigators assess insight of illness was assessed via Scale to Assess Unawareness of Mental Disorder and was used along with rating of psychopathology, course of illness, and compliance with treatments in a sample of 43 patients. Patients with poor insight are less likely to be compliant with treatment and are more likely to have a poorer prognosis. Patients with hallucinations sometimes experience positive symptoms, which can include delusions of reference, thought insertion/withdrawal, thought broadcast, delusions of persecution, grandiosity, and many more. These psychoses skew the patient's perspectives of reality in ways in which they truly believe are really happening. For instance, a patient that is experiencing delusions of reference may believe while watching the weather forecast that when the weatherman says it will rain, he is really sending a message to the patient in which rain symbolizes a specific warning completely irrelevant to what the weather is. Another example would be thought broadcast, which is when a patient believes that everyone can hear their thoughts. These positive symptoms sometimes are so severe to where the schizophrenic believes that something is crawling on them or smelling something that is not there in reality. These strong hallucinations are intense and difficult to convince the patient that they do not exist outside of their cognitive beliefs, making it extremely difficult for a patient to understand and become self-aware that what they are experiencing is in fact not there.\n\nFurthermore, a study by Bedford and Davis<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Bedford|author2=Davis|title=Denial of illness in schizophrenia as a disturbance of self-reflection, self-perception and insight|journal=Schizophrenia Research|year=2013|doi=10.1016/j.schres.2013.07.006|volume=152|issue=1|pages=89\u201396|pmid=23890596}}</ref> (2013) was conducted to look at the association of denial vs. acceptance of multiple facets of schizophrenia (self-reflection, self-perception, and insight) and its effect on self-reflection (N=26). Study results suggest patients with increased disease denial have lower recollection for self-evaluated mental illnesses. To a great extent, disease denial creates a hardship for patients to undergo recovery because their feelings and sensations are intensely outstanding. But just as this and the above studies imply, a large proportion of schizophrenics do not have self-awareness of their illness for many factors and severity of reasoning of their diagnoses.\n\n===Bipolar disorder===\n{{Main|Bipolar disorder}}\nBipolar disorder is an illness that causes shifts in mood, energy, and ability to function. Self-awareness is crucial in those suffering from this disease, as they must be able to distinguish between feeling a certain way because of the disorder or because of separate issues. \"Personality, behavior, and dysfunction affect your bipolar disorder, so you must 'know' yourself in order to make the distinction.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bipolarinsights.com/?page_id=247 | title=Self Awareness | publisher=Bipolar Insights}}</ref> This disorder is a difficult one to diagnose, as self-awareness changes with mood. \"For instance, what might appear to you as confidence and clever ideas for a new business venture might be a pattern of grandiose thinking and manic behavior\".<ref>{{cite web|last1=Tartakovsky|first1=Margarita|title=Living with Bipolar Disorder|url=http://psychcentral.com/lib/living-with-bipolar-disorder/0001851|website=psychcentral.com|date=2016-05-17}}</ref> Issues occur between understanding irrationality in a mood swing and being completely wrapped in a manic episode, rationalizing that the exhibited behaviors are normal.\n\nIt is important to be able to distinguish what are symptoms of bipolar disorder and what is not.

In addition, vining plants have been shown to avoid coiling around themselves, due to chemical receptors in the plants' tendrils. Unique to plants, awareness of self means that the plant can recognise self, whereas all other known conceptions of self-awareness is the ability to recognise what is not self.\n\n===Recognition and rejection of self in plant reproduction===\nResearch by June B. Nasrallah discovered that the plant's pollination mechanism also serves as a mechanism against self-reproduction, which lays out the foundation of scientific evidence that plants could be considered as self-aware organisms. The SI (Self-incompatibility) mechanism in plants is unique in the sense that awareness of self derives from the capacity to recognise self, rather than non-self. The SI mechanism function depends primarily on the interaction between genes ''S''-locus receptor protein kinase (SRK) and ''S''-locus cysteine-rich protein gene (''SCR).''  In cases of self-pollination, SRK and SCR bind to activate SKR, Inhibiting pollen from fertilizing. In cases of cross-pollination, SRK and SCR do not bind and therefore SRK is not activated, causing the pollen to fertilise. In simple terms, the receptors either accept or reject the genes present in the pollen, and when the genes are from the same plant, the SI mechanism described above creates a reaction to prevent the pollen from fertilising.\n\n===Self-discrimination in the tendrils of the vine ''Cayratia japonica'' mediated by physiological connection===\nThe research by Yuya Fukano and Akira Yamawo provides a link between self-discrimination in vining plants and amongst other classifications where the mechanism discovery has already been established. It also contributes to the general foundation of evidence of self-discrimination mechanisms in plants. The article makes the claim that the biological self-discrimination mechanism that is present in both flowering plants and ascidians, are also present in vining plants.  They tested this hypothesis by doing touch tests with self neighbouring and non-self neighbouring pairs of plants. the test was performed by placing the sets of plants close enough for their tendrils to interact with one-another. Evidence of self-discrimination in above-ground plants is demonstrated in the results of the touch testing, which showed that in cases of connected self plants, severed self plants and non-self plants, the rate of tendril activity and likeliness to coil was higher among separated plants than those attached via rhizomes.\n\n==Theater==\n{{Main|Theater}}\nTheater also concerns itself with other awareness besides self-awareness.<!--needs clarification or citation \"Continuous, simultaneous, nonjudgemental and total perception of internal and external environment.\"--> There is a possible correlation between the experience of the theater audience and individual self-awareness. As actors and audiences must not \"break\" the [[fourth wall]] in order to maintain context, so individuals must not be aware of the artificial, or the constructed perception of his or her [[reality]]. This suggests that both self-awareness and the social constructs applied to others are artificial continuums just as theater is. Theatrical efforts such as ''[[Six Characters in Search of an Author]]'', or ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]'', construct yet another layer of the fourth wall, but they do not destroy the primary illusion.

As a majority of birds are blind below the beak, Prior et al.<ref name=\"Reference 6\" /> marked the birds\u2019 neck with three different colors: red, yellow, and black (as an imitation, as magpies are originally black). When placed in front of a mirror, the birds with the red and yellow spots began scratching at their necks, signaling the understanding of something different being on their bodies. During one trial with a mirror and a mark, three out of the five magpies showed a minimum of one example of self-directed behavior. The magpies explored the mirror by moving toward it and looking behind it. One of the magpies, Harvey, during several trials would pick up objects, pose, do some wing-flapping, all in front of the mirror with the objects in his beak. This represents a sense of self-awareness; knowing what is going on within himself and in the present. The authors suggest that self-recognition in birds and mammals may be a case of [[convergent evolution]], where similar evolutionary pressures result in similar behaviors or traits, although they arrive at them via different routes.<ref name=\"PLoS Biology (DOI:10.1371/journal.pbio.0060202)\">{{cite journal |last=Alison |first=Motluk |title=Mirror test shows magpies aren't so bird-brained |journal=[[New Scientist]] |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn14552-mirror-test-shows-magpies-arent-so-birdbrained.html#.VHVdHf4tDIV |access-date=26 November 2014}}</ref>\n\nA few slight occurrences of behavior towards the magpie's own body happened in the trial with the black mark and the mirror.

This by simple reactions to specific situations which happens to benefit other individuals in the organism's natural environment. If self-awareness led to a necessity of an emotional empathy mechanism for altruism and egoism being default in its absence, that would have precluded [[evolution]] from a state without self-awareness to a self-aware state in all [[social animal]]s. The ability of the theory of evolution to explain self-awareness can be rescued by abandoning the hypothesis of self-awareness being a basis for cruelty.<ref>How the Body Shapes the Way We Think: A New View of Intelligence, Rolf Pfeifer, Josh Bongard October 2006</ref><ref>The Unpredictable Species: What Makes Humans Unique, Lieberman, P 2013</ref>\n\n==Psychology==\nSelf-awareness has been called \"arguably the most fundamental issue in psychology, from both a developmental and an evolutionary perspective.\"<ref name=\"Rochat 2003 717\u2013731\"/>\n\nSelf-awareness theory, developed by Duval and Wicklund in their 1972 landmark book ''A theory of objective self awareness'', states that when we focus our attention on ourselves, we evaluate and compare our current behavior to our internal standards and values.

Someone with a strong self-efficacy, for example, views challenges as mere tasks that must be overcome, and are not easily discouraged by setbacks. They are aware of their flaws and abilities and choose to utilize these qualities to the best of their ability. Someone with a weak sense of self-efficacy evades challenges and quickly feels discouraged by setbacks.

At this level the individual has a degree of zero self-awareness. This person is unaware of any mirror reflection or the mirror itself. They perceive the mirror as an extension of their environment. Level 0 can also be displayed when an adult frightens himself in a mirror mistaking his own reflection as another person just for a second.\n* Level 1: Differentiation. The individual realizes the mirror is able to reflect things. They see that what is in the mirror is different from what is surrounding them. At this level they can differentiate between their own movement in the mirror and the movement of the surrounding environment.\n* Level 2: Situation. At this point an individual can link the movements on the mirror to what is perceived within their own body. This is the first hint of self-exploration on a projected surface where what is visualized on the mirror is special to the self.\n* Level 3: Identification. This stage is characterized by the new ability to identify self: an individual can now see that what's in the mirror is not another person but actually them. It is seen when a child, instead of referring to the mirror while referring to themselves, refers to themselves while looking in the mirror.\n* Level 4: Permanence. Once an individual reaches this level they can identify the self beyond the present mirror imagery. They are able to identify the self in previous pictures looking different or younger. A \"permanent self\" is now experienced. \n* Level 5: Self-consciousness or \"meta\" self-awareness. At this level not only is the self seen from a first person view but it is realized that it is also seen from a third person's view. They begin to understand they can be in the mind of others. For instance, how they are seen from a public standpoint.<ref name=\"Rochat 2003 717\u2013731\"/>\n\n== Infancy and early childhood ==\nIt is to be kept in mind that as an infant comes into this world, they have no concept of what is around them, nor for the significance of others around them. It is throughout the first year that they gradually begin to acknowledge that their body is actually separate from that of their mother, and that they are an \"active, causal agent in space\". By the end of the first year, they additionally realize that their movement, as well, is separate from movement of the mother. That is a huge advance, yet they are still quite limited and cannot yet know what they look like, \"in the sense that the infant cannot recognize its own face\".<ref name=\":03\">{{cite book |editor1=Thomas D.

For example, in a study, an experimenter took a red marker and put a fairly large red dot (so it is visible by the infant) on the infant's nose, and placed them in front of a mirror. Prior to 15 months of age, the infant will not react to this, but after 15 months of age, they will either touch their nose, wondering what it is they have on their face, or point to it. This indicates the appearance that they recognize that the image they see in the reflection of the [https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1111/j.1532-7078.2007.tb00220.x mirror] is themselves.

Evidently, it is not at the level of an adult or an adolescent, but as an infant moves to middle childhood and onwards to adolescence, they develop a higher level of self-awareness and self-description.<ref name=\":03\" />\n\nAs infants develop their senses, using multiple senses of in order to recognize what is around them, infants can become affected by something known as \"facial multi stimulation\".

At this stage, a child begins to develop interests along with likes and dislikes. This transition enables the awareness of an individual's past, present, and future to grow as conscious experiences are remembered more often.<ref name=\"Rochat 1998 102\u2013109\" /> As a preschooler, they begin to give much more specific details about things, instead of generalizing. For example, the preschooler will talk about the Los Angeles Lakers basketball team, and the New York Rangers hockey team, instead of the infant just stating that he likes sports. Furthermore, they will start to express certain preferences (e.g., Tod likes mac and cheese) and will start to identify certain possessions of theirs (e.g., Lara has a bird as a pet at home). At this age, the infant is in the stage [[Jean Piaget|Piaget]] names the ''[[Piaget's theory of cognitive development|pre operational]]'' stage of development. The infant is very inaccurate at judging themselves because they do not have much to go about. For example, an infant at this stage will not associate that they are strong with their ability to cross the jungle gym at their school, nor will they associate the fact that they can solve a math problem with their ability to count.<ref name=\":03\" />\n\n==Adolescence==\nOne becomes conscious of their emotions during [[adolescence]]. Most children are aware of emotions such as [[shame]], [[Guilt (emotion)|guilt]], [[pride]] and [[embarrassment]] by the age of two, but do not fully understand how those emotions affect their life.<ref name=Zeanah>{{cite book|last=Zeanah|first=Charles|title=Handbook of Infant Mental Health|year=2009|publisher=Guilford Press|location=New York}}</ref> By age 13, children become more in touch with these emotions and begin to apply them to their own lives. A study entitled \"The Construction of the Self\" found that many adolescents display happiness and self-confidence around friends, but hopelessness and anger around parents due to the fear of being a disappointment. Teenagers were also shown to feel intelligent and creative around teachers, and shy, uncomfortable and nervous around people they were not familiar with.<ref name=Harter>{{cite book|last=Harter|first=Susan|title=The Construction of the Self|url=https://archive.org/details/constructionofse00susa|url-access=registration|year=1999|publisher=Guilford Press}}</ref>\n\nIn adolescent development, the definition self-awareness also has a more complex emotional context due to the maturity of adolescents compared to those in the early childhood phase, and these elements can include but are not limited to self-image, self-concept, and self\u2013consciousness along many other traits that can relate to Rochat's final level of self awareness, however it is still a distinct concept within its own previous definition.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite journal|date=2015-05-05|title=Study on the Development of Self-awareness in Teenagers|journal=Procedia \u2013 Social and Behavioral Sciences|language=en|volume=180|pages=1656\u20131660|doi=10.1016/j.sbspro.2015.05.060|issn=1877-0428|last1=Sandu|first1=Cristina Marina|last2=P\u00e2ni\u015foar\u00e3|first2=Georgeta|last3=P\u00e2ni\u015foar\u00e3|first3=Ion Ovidiu|doi-access=free}}</ref> Social interactions mainly separate the element of self-awareness in adolescent rather than in childhood, as well as further developed emotional recognition skills in adolescents.

In chapter XXVII \"On Identity and Diversity\" of Locke's ''[[An Essay Concerning Human Understanding]]'' (1689) he conceptualized consciousness as the repeated self-identification of [[self (philosophy)|oneself]] through which [[moral responsibility]] could be attributed to the [[subject (philosophy)|subject]]\u2014and therefore punishment and [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]]iness justified, as critics such as [[Nietzsche]] would point out, affirming \"...the psychology of conscience is not 'the voice of God in man'; it is the instinct of cruelty ... expressed, for the first time, as one of the oldest and most indispensable elements in the foundation of culture.\"<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=RPib_YcrjG4C&printsec=titlepage&dq=On+the+genealogy+of+morals Ecce Homo by Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche] p. 117</ref><ref>Richard Schacht ''Nietzsche, Genealogy, Morality'', p. 244, University of California Press, 1994 {{ISBN|978-0-520-08318-9}}</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=A0-XN6_rXV0C&printsec=titlepage&dq=On+the+genealogy+of+moral...

If consciousness is this \"thought\" which doubles all thoughts, then personal identity is only founded on the repeated act of consciousness: \"This may show us wherein personal identity consists: not in the identity of substance, but ... in the identity of consciousness.\"<ref name=\"What Is Self-Awareness\"/> For example, one may claim to be a [[reincarnation]] of Plato, therefore having the same soul. However, one would be the same [[person]] as Plato only if one had the same consciousness of Plato's thoughts and actions that he himself did. Therefore, self-identity is not based on the soul. One soul may have various personalities.\n\nLocke argues that self-identity is not founded either on the body or the substance, as the substance may change while the person remains the same. \"Animal identity is preserved in identity of life, and not of substance\", as the body of the animal grows and changes during its life.<ref name=\"What Is Self-Awareness\"/> describes a case of a prince and a cobbler in which the soul of the prince is transferred to the body of the cobbler and vice versa. The prince still views himself as a prince, though he no longer looks like one. This border-case leads to the problematic thought that since personal identity is based on consciousness, and that only oneself can be aware of his consciousness, exterior human judges may never know if they really are judging\u2014and punishing\u2014the same person, or simply the same body. Locke argues that one may be judged for the actions of one's body rather than one's soul, and only God knows how to correctly judge a man's actions.  Men also are only responsible for the acts of which they are conscious. This forms the basis of the [[insanity defense]] which argues that one cannot be held accountable for acts in which they were [[unconsciousness|unconsciously]] irrational, or mentally ill<ref>Abraham S. Goldstein ''The Insanity Defense'', p. 9, Yale University Press, 1967 {{ISBN|978-0-300-00099-3}}</ref>\u2014 In reference to man's personality, Locke claims that \"whatever past actions it cannot reconcile or appropriate to that present self by consciousness, it can be no more concerned in it than if they had never been done: and to receive pleasure or pain, i.e. reward or punishment, on the account of any such action, is all one as to be made happy or miserable in its first being, without any demerit at all.\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Kendra|first1=Cherry|title=What Is Self-Awareness?|url=http://psychology.about.com/od/cognitivepsychology/fl/What-Is-Self-Awareness.htm|accessdate=26 November 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Disorders==\nThe medical term for not being aware of one's deficits is [[anosognosia]], or more commonly known as a lack of insight.

To understand the many effects of autism spectrum disorders on those afflicted have led many scientists to theorize what level of self-awareness occurs and in what degree. Research found that ASD can be associated with intellectual disability and difficulties in motor coordination and attention. It can also result in physical health issues as well, such as sleep and gastrointestinal disturbances. As a result of all those problems, individuals are literally unaware of themselves.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Autism|first1=Speaks|title=What Is Autism?

Scientists at the University of Cambridge have produced evidence that self-awareness is a main problem for people with ASD. Researchers used functional magnetic resonance scans (FMRI) to measure brain activity in volunteers being asked to make judgments about their own thoughts, opinions, preferences, as well as about someone else's. One area of the brain closely examined was the ventromedial pre-frontal cortex (vMPFC) which is known to be active when people think about themselves.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/12/091213214104.htm | title=How the autistic brain distinguishes oneself from others | date=December 14, 2009 | website=Science Daily}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Autismbrain.jpg|mediumpx|thumbnail|Major brain structures implicated in [[autism]].]]\nA study out of Stanford University has tried to map out brain circuits with understanding self-awareness in Autism Spectrum Disorders.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Uddin |first=Lucina |date=October 29, 2008 |title=Neural Basis of Self and Other Representation in Autism: An fMRI Study of Self-Face Recognition |journal=[[PLOS One]] |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0003526 |pmid=18958161 |pmc=2568959 |volume=3 |issue=10 |pages=e3526 |bibcode=2008PLoSO...3.3526U }}</ref> This study suggests that self-awareness is primarily lacking in social situations but when in private they are more self-aware and present.

This theory suggests that this happens due to the behavioral inhibitory system which is responsible for self-preservation. This is the system that prevents human from self-harm like jumping out of a speeding bus or putting our hand on a hot stove. Once a dangerous situation is perceived then the behavioral inhibitory system kicks in and restrains our activities. \"For individuals with ASD, this inhibitory mechanism is so powerful, it operates on the least possible trigger and shows an over sensitivity to impending danger and possible threats.<ref name=\"ncbi.nlm.nih.gov\"/> Some of these dangers may be perceived as being in the presence of strangers, or a loud noise from a radio. In these situations self-awareness can be compromised due to the desire of self preservation, which trumps social composure and proper interaction.\n \nThe Hobson hypothesis reports that autism begins in infancy due to the lack of cognitive and linguistic engagement which in turn results in impaired reflective self-awareness. In this study ten children with Asperger's Syndrome were examined using the Self-understanding Interview.  This interview was created by Damon and Hart and focuses on seven core areas or schemas that measure the capacity to think in increasingly difficult levels. This interview will estimate the level of self understanding present. \"The study showed that the Asperger group demonstrated impairment in the 'self-as-object' and 'self-as-subject' domains of the Self-understanding Interview, which supported Hobson's concept of an impaired capacity for self-awareness and self-reflection in people with ASD.\".<ref>{{cite journal| journal=J Autism Dev Disord | date=May 2012 | volume=42 | issue=5 | pages=697\u2013706 | doi=10.1007/s10803-011-1296-8 | title= Asperger through the looking glass: an exploratory study of self-understanding in people with Asperger's syndrome | author1=Jackson, P | author2=Skirrow, P | author3=Hare DJ | pmid=21647793}}</ref> Self-understanding is a self description in an individual's past, present and future.

Mirror Self Awareness Development (MSAD) activities were used as a four-step framework to measure increases in self-awareness in those with ASD. Self-awareness and knowledge is not something that can simply be taught through direct instruction. Instead, students acquire this knowledge by interacting with their environment.<ref name=\"legacy.uphs.upenn.edu\"/> Mirror understanding and its relation to the development of self leads to measurable increases in self-awareness in those with ASD. It also proves to be a highly engaging and highly preferred tool in understanding the developmental stages of self- awareness.\n \nThere have been many different theories and studies done on what degree of self-awareness is displayed among people with autism spectrum disorder. Scientists have done research about the various parts of the brain associated with understanding self and self-awareness. Studies have shown evidence of areas of the brain that are impacted by ASD. Other theories suggest that helping an individual learn more about themselves through Joint Activities, such as the Mirror Self Awareness Development may help teach positive self-awareness and growth. In helping to build self-awareness it is also possible to build self-esteem and self acceptance. This in turn can help to allow the individual with ASD to relate better to their environment and have better social interactions with others.\n\n===Schizophrenia===\n{{Main|Schizophrenia}}\nSchizophrenia is a chronic psychiatric illness characterized by excessive dopamine activity in the mesolimbic tract and insufficient dopamine activity in the mesocortical tract leading to symptoms of psychosis along with poor cognition in socialization. Under the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]], people with schizophrenia have a combination of positive, negative and psychomotor symptoms. These cognitive disturbances involve rare beliefs and/or thoughts of a distorted reality that creates an abnormal pattern of functioning for the patient. The cause of schizophrenia has a substantial genetic component [[polygene|involving many genes]]. While the [[heritability]] of schizophrenia has been found to be around 80%, only about 60% of sufferers report a positive [[Family history (medicine)|family history]] of the disorder, and ultimately the cause is thought to be a combination of genetic and environmental factors.<ref name=\"ODonovan_et_al_2003\">{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Donovan MC, Williams NM, Owen MJ | title = Recent advances in the genetics of schizophrenia | journal = Human Molecular Genetics | volume = 12 Spec No 2 | pages = R125\u201333 | date = October 2003 | pmid = 12952866 | doi = 10.1093/hmg/ddg302 | doi-access = free }}</ref> It is believed that the experience of stressful life events is an environmental factor that can trigger the onset of schizophrenia in individuals who already are at risk from genetics and age.<ref name=\"Life Events & Schizophrenia\">{{cite journal |title=Life events and schizophrenia: The \"triggering\" hypothesis |journal=[[Acta Psychiatrica Scandinavica]] |date=2007-08-23 |last=Day |first=R. |volume=64 |issue=2 |doi= 10.1111/j.1600-0447.1981.tb00765.x |pages=97\u2013122|pmid=7032227 }}</ref> The level of self-awareness among patients with schizophrenia is a heavily studied topic.\n\nSchizophrenia as a disease state is characterized by severe cognitive dysfunction and it is uncertain to what extent patients are aware of this deficiency. Medalia and Lim (2004) <ref>{{cite journal|last=Medalia|first=Amelia|title=Self-awareness of cognitive functioning in schizophrenia|journal=Schizophrenia Research|year=2004|volume=71|issue=2\u20133|pages=331\u2013338 |doi=10.1016/j.schres.2004.03.003 |pmid=15474903}}</ref> investigated patients\u2019 awareness of their cognitive deficit in the areas of attention, nonverbal memory, and verbal memory. Results from this study (N=185) revealed large discrepancy in patients\u2019 assessment of their cognitive functioning relative to the assessment of their clinicians. Though it is impossible to access one's consciousness and truly understand what a schizophrenic believes, regardless in this study, patients were not aware of their cognitive dysfunctional reasoning. In the [[DSM-5]], to receive a diagnosis of schizophrenia, they must have two or more of the following symptoms in the duration of one month: delusions*, hallucinations*, disorganized speech*, grossly disorganized/catatonic behavior and negative symptoms (*these three symptoms above all other symptoms must be present to correctly diagnose a patient.) Sometimes these symptoms are very prominent and are treated with a combination of [[antipsychotics]] (i.e. haloperidol, loxapine), atypical antipsychotics (such as clozapine and risperdone) and psychosocial therapies that include family interventions and socials skills. When a patient is undergoing treatment and recovering from the disorder, the memory of their behavior is present in a diminutive amount; thus, self-awareness of diagnoses of schizophrenia after treatment is rare, as well as subsequent to onset and prevalence in the patient.\n\nThe above findings are further supported by a study conducted by Amador and colleagues.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Amador|author2=Lim|title=Assessment of insight in psychosis|journal=American Journal of Psychiatry|year=1993|volume=150|issue=6|pages=873\u2013879|doi=10.1176/ajp.150.6.873|pmid=8494061|citeseerx=10.1.1.457.5515}}</ref> The study suggests a correlation exists between patient insight, compliance, and disease progression. Investigators assess insight of illness was assessed via Scale to Assess Unawareness of Mental Disorder and was used along with rating of psychopathology, course of illness, and compliance with treatments in a sample of 43 patients. Patients with poor insight are less likely to be compliant with treatment and are more likely to have a poorer prognosis. Patients with hallucinations sometimes experience positive symptoms, which can include delusions of reference, thought insertion/withdrawal, thought broadcast, delusions of persecution, grandiosity, and many more. These psychoses skew the patient's perspectives of reality in ways in which they truly believe are really happening. For instance, a patient that is experiencing delusions of reference may believe while watching the weather forecast that when the weatherman says it will rain, he is really sending a message to the patient in which rain symbolizes a specific warning completely irrelevant to what the weather is. Another example would be thought broadcast, which is when a patient believes that everyone can hear their thoughts. These positive symptoms sometimes are so severe to where the schizophrenic believes that something is crawling on them or smelling something that is not there in reality. These strong hallucinations are intense and difficult to convince the patient that they do not exist outside of their cognitive beliefs, making it extremely difficult for a patient to understand and become self-aware that what they are experiencing is in fact not there.\n\nFurthermore, a study by Bedford and Davis<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Bedford|author2=Davis|title=Denial of illness in schizophrenia as a disturbance of self-reflection, self-perception and insight|journal=Schizophrenia Research|year=2013|doi=10.1016/j.schres.2013.07.006|volume=152|issue=1|pages=89\u201396|pmid=23890596}}</ref> (2013) was conducted to look at the association of denial vs. acceptance of multiple facets of schizophrenia (self-reflection, self-perception, and insight) and its effect on self-reflection (N=26). Study results suggest patients with increased disease denial have lower recollection for self-evaluated mental illnesses. To a great extent, disease denial creates a hardship for patients to undergo recovery because their feelings and sensations are intensely outstanding. But just as this and the above studies imply, a large proportion of schizophrenics do not have self-awareness of their illness for many factors and severity of reasoning of their diagnoses.\n\n===Bipolar disorder===\n{{Main|Bipolar disorder}}\nBipolar disorder is an illness that causes shifts in mood, energy, and ability to function. Self-awareness is crucial in those suffering from this disease, as they must be able to distinguish between feeling a certain way because of the disorder or because of separate issues. \"Personality, behavior, and dysfunction affect your bipolar disorder, so you must 'know' yourself in order to make the distinction.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bipolarinsights.com/?page_id=247 | title=Self Awareness | publisher=Bipolar Insights}}</ref> This disorder is a difficult one to diagnose, as self-awareness changes with mood. \"For instance, what might appear to you as confidence and clever ideas for a new business venture might be a pattern of grandiose thinking and manic behavior\".<ref>{{cite web|last1=Tartakovsky|first1=Margarita|title=Living with Bipolar Disorder|url=http://psychcentral.com/lib/living-with-bipolar-disorder/0001851|website=psychcentral.com|date=2016-05-17}}</ref> Issues occur between understanding irrationality in a mood swing and being completely wrapped in a manic episode, rationalizing that the exhibited behaviors are normal.\n\nIt is important to be able to distinguish what are symptoms of bipolar disorder and what is not. A study done by Mathew et al. was done with the aim of \"examining the perceptions of illness in self and among other patients with bipolar disorder in remission\".<ref name=\"Mathew 462\u2013470\">{{Cite journal|last=Mathew|first=Anandit J.|last2=Samuel|first2=Beulah|last3=Jacob|first3=K.S.|title=Perceptions of Illness in Self and in Others Among Patients With Bipolar Disorder|journal=International Journal of Social Psychiatry|volume=56|issue=5|pages=462\u2013470|doi=10.1177/0020764009106621|pmid=19651694|year=2009}}</ref>\n\nThe study took place at the Department of Psychiatry, Christian Medical College, Vellore, India, which is a centre that specializes in the \"management of patients with mental and behavioural disorders\".<ref name=\"Mathew 462\u2013470\"/> Eighty two patients (thirty two female and fifty male) agreed to partake in the study. These patients met the \"[[ICD-10|International Classification of Diseases \u2013 10]] diagnostic criteria for a diagnosis of bipolar disorder I or II and were in remission\"<ref name=\"Mathew 462\u2013470\"/> and were put through a variety of baseline assessments before beginning the study. These baseline assessments included using a vignette, which was then used as an assessment tool during their follow-up. Patients were then randomly divided into two groups, one who would be following a \"structured educational intervention programme\" <ref name=\"Mathew 462\u2013470\"/>(experimental group), while the other would be following \"usual care\" (control group).\n\nThe study was based on an interview in which patients were asked an array of open-eded questions regarding topics such as \"perceived causes, consequences, severity and its effects on body, emotion, social network and home life, and on work, severity, possible course of action, help-seeking behaviour and the role of the doctor/healer\".<ref name=\"Mathew 462\u2013470\"/> The [[McNemar's test|McNemar test]] was then used to compare the patients perspective of the illness versus their explanation of the illness. The results of the study show that the beliefs that patients associated with their illness corresponds with the possible causes of the disorder,<ref name=\"Mathew 462\u2013470\"/> whereas \"studies done among patients during periods of active psychosis have recorded disagreement between their assessments of their own illness\".<ref>{{Cite journal|title=Use of psychopathology vignettes by patients with schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorder and by mental health professionals to judge patients' insight|journal=American Journal of Psychiatry|language=en|volume=150|issue=11|pages=1649\u20131653|doi=10.1176/ajp.150.11.1649|pmid=8214172|year=1993|last1=McEvoy|first1=J.

The claim that plants are capable of perceiving self lies in the evidence found that plants will not reproduce with themselves due to a gene selecting mechanism.  In addition, vining plants have been shown to avoid coiling around themselves, due to chemical receptors in the plants' tendrils. Unique to plants, awareness of self means that the plant can recognise self, whereas all other known conceptions of self-awareness is the ability to recognise what is not self.\n\n===Recognition and rejection of self in plant reproduction===\nResearch by June B. Nasrallah discovered that the plant's pollination mechanism also serves as a mechanism against self-reproduction, which lays out the foundation of scientific evidence that plants could be considered as self-aware organisms. The SI (Self-incompatibility) mechanism in plants is unique in the sense that awareness of self derives from the capacity to recognise self, rather than non-self. The SI mechanism function depends primarily on the interaction between genes ''S''-locus receptor protein kinase (SRK) and ''S''-locus cysteine-rich protein gene (''SCR).''  In cases of self-pollination, SRK and SCR bind to activate SKR, Inhibiting pollen from fertilizing. In cases of cross-pollination, SRK and SCR do not bind and therefor SRK is not activated, causing the pollen to fertilise. In simple terms, the receptors either accept or reject the genes present in the pollen, and when the genes are from the same plant, the SI mechanism described above creates a reaction to prevent the pollen from fertilising.\n\n===Self-discrimination in the tendrils of the vine ''Cayratia japonica'' mediated by physiological connection===\nThe research by Yuya Fukano and Akira Yamawo provides a link between self-discrimination in vining plants and amongst other classifications where the mechanism discovery has already been established. It also contributes to the general foundation of evidence of self-discrimination mechanisms in plants. The article makes the claim that the biological self-discrimination mechanism that is present in both flowering plants and ascidians, are also present in vining plants.  They tested this hypothesis by doing touch tests with self neighbouring and non-self neighbouring pairs of plants. the test was performed by placing the sets of plants close enough for their tendrils to interact with one-another. Evidence of self-discrimination in above-ground plants is demonstrated in the results of the touch testing, which showed that in cases of connected self plants, severed self plants and non-self plants, the rate of tendril activity and likeliness to coil was higher among separated plants than those attached via rhizomes.\n\n==Theater==\n{{Main|Theater}}\nTheater also concerns itself with other awareness besides self-awareness.<!--needs clarification or citation \"Continuous, simultaneous, nonjudgemental and total perception of internal and external environment.\"--> There is a possible correlation between the experience of the theater audience and individual self-awareness. As actors and audiences must not \"break\" the [[fourth wall]] in order to maintain context, so individuals must not be aware of the artificial, or the constructed perception of his or her [[reality]]. This suggests that both self-awareness and the social constructs applied to others are artificial continuums just as theater is. Theatrical efforts such as ''[[Six Characters in Search of an Author]]'', or ''[[The Wonderful Wizard of Oz]]'', construct yet another layer of the fourth wall, but they do not destroy the primary illusion.
