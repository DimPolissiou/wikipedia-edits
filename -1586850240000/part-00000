It lies on the southern border of the county, adjacent to [[Shoreline, Washington|Shoreline]] and [[Lynnwood, Washington|Lynnwood]], and is {{convert|13|mi|km}} to the north of downtown [[Seattle]]. As of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], the city had a population of 19,909 people.\n\nMountlake Terrace was founded in 1949 by suburban developers on the site of a disused airfield. Within five years, the community had grown to over 5,000 people and was [[Municipal incorporation|incorporated]] as a city in 1954 to provide municipal services. In recent decades, Mountlake Terrace has begun development of its own downtown with [[mixed-use development|mixed-use buildings]] and large employers in lieu of remaining a [[bedroom community]] for Seattle commuters. [[Interstate 5 in Washington|Interstate 5]] runs north\u2013south through the city and connects Mountlake Terrace to Seattle and [[Everett, Washington|Everett]].\n\n==History==\nThe site of Mountlake Terrace was thickly forested in the mid-Nineteenth Century and formed part of the traditional hunting-gathering areas of the [[Snohomish people]]. The area was obtained by the [[Port Gamble, Mill Town|Puget Mill Company]] in 1862. By 1900, most of the land in south Snohomish County had been logged. Pope & Talbot Company, the successor entity of the Puget Mill Company, subdivided the cut area into 10-acre plots, which were sold as \"chicken ranches.\" These plots were sold with moderate success to ranchers raising poultry, mink, and chinchilla. An interurban rail line between [[Tacoma, Washington]] and [[Everett, Washington]] was built in 1910, allowing easier access to the farms from throughout the region. Many of them failed during the [[Great Depression]], however, and the railroad was abandoned in 1939.<ref name=HistoryLink>{{cite web|url=http://www.historylink.org/index.cfm?DisplayPage=output.cfm&file_id=8576|title=Mountlake Terrace -- Thumbnail History|publisher=HistoryLink}}</ref>\n\nA portion of the area was used by the United States government during World War II as a [[Aerodrome|landing field]]. At the end of the war, the government ceased operation of the airfield. In 1949, developers Albert LaPierre and Jack Peterson.<ref name=HistoryLink />{{efn|Jack Peterson (1904-1996, Saskatchewan) arrived in Seattle in the late 1930s. Albert L. LaPierre (1907-1989) was an imaginative developer and organizer. In 1949, they bought land north of 244th Street SW and east of I-5, named it, platted it, and began building two-bedroom houses on (20'x30') concrete slabs. The houses were built on a type of assembly line; interior painting and landscaping were left to the purchasers. With demand for housing soaring, the houses sold faster than they could be built. Peterson-LaPierre bought more land and built larger houses, but kept their prices reasonable.}} bought the abandoned airstrip and began constructing cinder-block houses. They named their development \"Mountlake Terrace\" because from some parts of the property they could see both Mount Rainier and Lake Washington, and the old runway looked a little like a terrace.\n\n===Incorporation===\nIn 1954, over 5,000 people lived in the area between 244th and 216th Streets SW, and 48th and 68th Avenues W.<ref name=History>{{cite web|url=http://www.cityofmlt.com/forVisitors/communityProfile/history.htm|title=Mountlake Terrace History|publisher=City of Mountlake Terrace|access-date=2014-09-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150610091230/http://www.cityofmlt.com/forVisitors/communityProfile/history.htm|archive-date=2015-06-10|url-status=dead}}</ref> The existing infrastructure was overwhelmed by this unplanned growth. Some people waited a year for a party-line telephone, streets were unpaved, and household sanitation was provided by individual septic systems. The nearest police department was in Everett, 15 miles away. One resident, Patrick McMahan, became frustrated by these conditions, and organized the Mountlake Terrace Study Committee, which led a campaign to incorporate the community. The election held November 23, 1954 supported incorporation, 517 to 483. Voters chose a five-person city council in the same election. The council had its first meeting on November 24 and selected Gilbert \"Gil\" Geiser, a 35-year-old hardware store owner, as Mountlake Terrace's first mayor. Geiser had to lend the new city $5 so the incorporation papers could be filed. With the filing, on November 29, Mountlake Terrace officially became a third-class city.<ref name=HistoryLink /><ref name=History />\n\n===Early growth===\nMountlake Terrace's population doubled between 1950 and 1960 and then nearly doubled again by 1970. Small businesses flourished in two strip-mall-type shopping centers in the middle of the area, on land provided by the developers. The developers also donated land for several churches, including the parish of St. Pius X, which celebrated its first mass on June 22, 1955. The [[Fluke Corporation|John Fluke Corporation]] moved its electronics center from Seattle to Mountlake Terrace in 1959. In 1961 a bond issue was approved in a special election; it was used to build a City Hall.<ref name=HistoryLink /><ref>{{cite news |date=December 2014 |title=Mountlake Terrace Looking Back 60 Years & Beyond |url=http://www.cityofmlt.com/Archive/ViewFile/Item/2850 |work=City Happenings |publisher=City of Mountlake Terrace |accessdate=March 9, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Slowing of development===\nThe city had been first envisioned as an automobile-based [[Commuter town|bedroom community]], but subsequent leaders began to envision it as a \"stand-alone\" development with an economically vital downtown area. This effort was aided by the arrival of Fluke and the construction of the two strip malls and the City Hall.<ref name=History />  However, this development halted in the 1980s. [[Boeing]] suffered a significant business downturn, in which about 75% of plant workers in Everett lost their jobs; [[Alderwood Mall]] was opened in [[Lynnwood, Washington|Lynnwood]] which drew much of the area's business away from downtown; and in 1990 two arson fires in the city center caused significant destruction.<ref name=History />{{efn|A local resident, James Schmitt, confessed to setting a total of 13 fires, two in the 56th Avenue/232nd Street area. West Plaza was out of business for 20 months; East Plaza was permanently shut down, replaced with a gymnastics center.}} In 1981, Fluke moved its facility to Everett. The 1980 census showed that Mountlake Terrace's population had dropped by almost 5 percent in 10 years. The city budget was repeatedly trimmed, but Mountlake Terrace entered 1989 with a $1.3 million deficit.<ref name=HistoryLink />\n\n===Recent history===\n[[Image:Mountlake Terrace 236th&56th.JPG|thumb|right|Intersection of 236th St SW and 56th Ave W in downtown Mountlake Terrace.]]\nThe mid-2000s saw new construction on 56th Avenue, and in 2006 the city created a plan to revitalize the downtown area and encourage economic activity.<ref name=HistoryLink /><ref name=History />{{efn|The council approved design standards requiring that new developments be built with wide sidewalks, lots of windows, awnings, and interesting architectural details.}} As of 2013 the town's largest employer was [[Premera Blue Cross]], which employs some 3,000 people.<ref name=CAFR>[http://www.cityofmlt.com/cityServices/financesAndBudget/pdf/2013_CAFR.pdf City of Mountlake Terrace CAFR 2013] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140826120444/http://www.cityofmlt.com/cityServices/financesAndBudget/pdf/2013_CAFR.pdf |date=2014-08-26 }}</ref>\n\nA city-center plan adopted in February 2007 allows mixed-use buildings of up to seven stories in the central block and up to five stories in surrounding blocks.

It lies on the southern border of the county, adjacent to [[Shoreline, Washington|Shoreline]] and [[Lynnwood, Washington|Lynnwood]], and is {{convert|13|mi|km}} to the north of downtown [[Seattle]]. As of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], the city had a population of 19,909 people.\n\nMountlake Terrace was founded in 1949 by suburban developers on the site of a disused airfield. Within five years, the community had grown to over 5,000 people and was [[Municipal incorporation|incorporated]] as a city in 1954 to provide municipal services. In recent decades, Mountlake Terrace has begun development of its own downtown with [[mixed-use development|mixed-use buildings]] and large employers in lieu of remaining a [[bedroom community]] for Seattle commuters. [[Interstate 5 in Washington|Interstate 5]] runs north\u2013south through the city and connects Mountlake Terrace to Seattle and [[Everett, Washington|Everett]].\n\n==History==\nThe site of Mountlake Terrace was thickly forested in the mid-Nineteenth Century and formed part of the traditional hunting-gathering areas of the [[Snohomish people]]. The area was obtained by the [[Port Gamble, Mill Town|Puget Mill Company]] in 1862. By 1900, most of the land in south Snohomish County had been logged. Pope & Talbot Company, the successor entity of the Puget Mill Company, subdivided the cut area into 10-acre plots, which were sold as \"chicken ranches.\" These plots were sold with moderate success to ranchers raising poultry, mink, and chinchilla. An interurban rail line between [[Tacoma, Washington]] and [[Everett, Washington]] was built in 1910, allowing easier access to the farms from throughout the region. Many of them failed during the [[Great Depression]], however, and the railroad was abandoned in 1939.<ref name=HistoryLink>{{cite web|url=http://www.historylink.org/index.cfm?DisplayPage=output.cfm&file_id=8576|title=Mountlake Terrace -- Thumbnail History|publisher=HistoryLink}}</ref>\n\nA portion of the area was used by the United States government during World War II as a [[Aerodrome|landing field]]. At the end of the war, the government ceased operation of the airfield. In 1949, developers Albert LaPierre and Jack Peterson.<ref name=HistoryLink />{{efn|Jack Peterson (1904-1996, Saskatchewan) arrived in Seattle in the late 1930s. Albert L. LaPierre (1907-1989) was an imaginative developer and organizer. In 1949, they bought land north of 244th Street SW and east of I-5, named it, platted it, and began building two-bedroom houses on (20'x30') concrete slabs. The houses were built on a type of assembly line; interior painting and landscaping were left to the purchasers. With demand for housing soaring, the houses sold faster than they could be built. Peterson-LaPierre bought more land and built larger houses, but kept their prices reasonable.}} bought the abandoned airstrip and began constructing cinder-block houses. They named their development \"Mountlake Terrace\" because from some parts of the property they could see both Mount Rainier and Lake Washington, and the old runway looked a little like a terrace.\n\n===Incorporation===\nIn 1954, over 5,000 people lived in the area between 244th and 216th Streets SW, and 48th and 68th Avenues W.<ref name=History>{{cite web|url=http://www.cityofmlt.com/forVisitors/communityProfile/history.htm|title=Mountlake Terrace History|publisher=City of Mountlake Terrace|access-date=2014-09-19|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150610091230/http://www.cityofmlt.com/forVisitors/communityProfile/history.htm|archive-date=2015-06-10|url-status=dead}}</ref> The existing infrastructure was overwhelmed by this unplanned growth. Some people waited a year for a party-line telephone, streets were unpaved, and household sanitation was provided by individual septic systems. The nearest police department was in Everett, 15 miles away. One resident, Patrick McMahan, became frustrated by these conditions, and organized the Mountlake Terrace Study Committee, which led a campaign to incorporate the community. The election held November 23, 1954 supported incorporation, 517 to 483. Voters chose a five-person city council in the same election. The council had its first meeting on November 24 and selected Gilbert \"Gil\" Geiser, a 35-year-old hardware store owner, as Mountlake Terrace's first mayor. Geiser had to lend the new city $5 so the incorporation papers could be filed. With the filing, on November 29, Mountlake Terrace officially became a third-class city.<ref name=HistoryLink /><ref name=History />\n\n===Early growth===\nMountlake Terrace's population doubled between 1950 and 1960 and then nearly doubled again by 1970. Small businesses flourished in two strip-mall-type shopping centers in the middle of the area, on land provided by the developers. The developers also donated land for several churches, including the parish of St. Pius X, which celebrated its first mass on June 22, 1955. The [[Fluke Corporation|John Fluke Corporation]] moved its electronics center from Seattle to Mountlake Terrace in 1959. In 1961 a bond issue was approved in a special election; it was used to build a City Hall.<ref name=HistoryLink /><ref>{{cite news |date=December 2014 |title=Mountlake Terrace Looking Back 60 Years & Beyond |url=http://www.cityofmlt.com/Archive/ViewFile/Item/2850 |work=City Happenings |publisher=City of Mountlake Terrace |accessdate=March 9, 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Slowing of development===\nThe city had been first envisioned as an automobile-based [[Commuter town|bedroom community]], but subsequent leaders began to envision it as a \"stand-alone\" development with an economically vital downtown area. This effort was aided by the arrival of Fluke and the construction of the two strip malls and the City Hall.<ref name=History />  However, this development halted in the 1980s. [[Boeing]] suffered a significant business downturn, in which about 75% of plant workers in Everett lost their jobs; [[Alderwood Mall]] was opened in [[Lynnwood, Washington|Lynnwood]] which drew much of the area's business away from downtown; and in 1990 two arson fires in the city center caused significant destruction.<ref name=History />{{efn|A local resident, James Schmitt, confessed to setting a total of 13 fires, two in the 56th Avenue/232nd Street area. West Plaza was out of business for 20 months; East Plaza was permanently shut down, replaced with a gymnastics center.}} In 1981, Fluke moved its facility to Everett. The 1980 census showed that Mountlake Terrace's population had dropped by almost 5 percent in 10 years. The city budget was repeatedly trimmed, but Mountlake Terrace entered 1989 with a $1.3 million deficit.<ref name=HistoryLink />\n\n===Recent history===\n[[Image:Mountlake Terrace 236th&56th.JPG|thumb|right|Intersection of 236th St SW and 56th Ave W in downtown Mountlake Terrace.]]\nThe mid-2000s saw new construction on 56th Avenue, and in 2006 the city created a plan to revitalize the downtown area and encourage economic activity.<ref name=HistoryLink /><ref name=History />{{efn|The council approved design standards requiring that new developments be built with wide sidewalks, lots of windows, awnings, and interesting architectural details.}} As of 2013 the town's largest employer was [[Premera Blue Cross]], which employs some 3,000 people.<ref name=CAFR>[http://www.cityofmlt.com/cityServices/financesAndBudget/pdf/2013_CAFR.pdf City of Mountlake Terrace CAFR 2013] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140826120444/http://www.cityofmlt.com/cityServices/financesAndBudget/pdf/2013_CAFR.pdf |date=2014-08-26 }}</ref>\n\nA city-center plan adopted in February 2007 allows mixed-use buildings of up to seven stories in the central block and up to five stories in surrounding blocks.

Its setting is not [[Columbia University]] in New York City but a fictional university in [[Stockton, California]], which is based on San Francisco State College (later [[San Francisco State University]]).  [[Thunderclap Newman]]'s \"[[Something in the Air]]\" and numerous other rock songs are used on the [[soundtrack]].\n\n==Plot==\nSimon, a student at a fictional university in San Francisco is indifferent to the student protests around him, until walking in on a naked woman in his dormitory roommate's bed. While she quickly runs over to the toilets to dress, Simon protests to his roommate that their time should only be devoted to studying, so they can get good jobs and lots of money.\n\nComing back clothed, the woman refuses setting another date with the roommate because she'll be busy protesting. She explains the university's plan to construct a gymnasium in an [[African-American neighborhood]], thus causing conflict with the local African American population. She tells him that she and others plan to take over one of the university's buildings.\n\nSimon later experiences [[love at first sight]] with a female student and uses his photographer position in the college's journal to photograph her. Following her into the university building the students are taking over, he joins the takeover just by being there. She approaches him while he boringly fools around in the toilets. She says her name is Linda and asks him to rob a food store with her so the striking students can eat.\n\nIn a later student protest, Simon is arrested. He then tells Linda he is not a radical like her. He does not want to \"blow the college building\" after doing his best to be accepted into the school in the first place. Linda later claims she can't see someone who is not likewise dedicated to the movement. Nevertheless, she announces temporarily leaving college to decide for sure.\n\nIn the showers, the rightist jock George beats up Simon, who decides to take advantage of the situation and use his injuries from George to fake [[police brutality]]. Gaining fame, his friend tells him \"a white version of page 43\" of Simon's ''[[National Geographic Magazine|National Geographic]]'' looks for him.\n\nAlone in a filing room, a large breasted redhead with a tight sweater smiles at Simon. Seeing his injured lip, she puts his hands on her right breast and asks if it feels better now. She then takes off her sweater telling Simon \"did you know [[Lenin]] loved women with big breasts?\" After quick flashes of her breasts, Simon confirms liking them, but asks her if she saw ''[[The Graduate]]''. Replying no, she takes him between some filing cabinets and takes off his belt. To her surprise, Simon does not want people to see whatever it is she plans to do to with him. When asking her if she at least locked the door, she confirms unconvincingly and immediately opens up some filing cabinets to hide them. Simon is worried, but she promises him no one will know. She then says she will give him something a \"hero\" like him deserves, ducks down and gives him an off-screen [[Fellatio|blowjob]], zooming up on [[Che Guevara (photo)|Che Guevara's famous poster]] staring in the air in its implacable expression.\n\nAfter Linda returns, she announces her decision to be with Simon. They spend the rest of that day together \u2013 and implicitly the night. The following day, they make out in a park when a group of African-Americans approaches them. The anti-racism Caucasian rebels fear for their lives. One African-American drops Simon's camera to the ground and stomps on it, but the group then simply leaves. A furious Simon meets the strikers, saying those they help are no different than the cops and the establishment and questioning why they should help those who disrespect and even threaten him.\n\nSimon re-thinks his comparison, though, after visiting none other than George the \u2013 now leftist \u2013 jock in the hospital. George's leg is in a cast after rightist jocks beat him up while cops watched. Simon goes to personally warn the dean's secretary to call off the construction of the gymnasium or risk a war. A group of African American students then show up, proving Simon's previous [[generalization]] wrong.\n\nEventually, a [[SWAT]] team crushes the university building takeover in seconds with [[Riot control agent#Tear gas|tear gas]]. With the strikers all lying choking, the SWAT members pull out African Americans from the crowd and beat them up with [[Club (law enforcement)|police clubs]]. When the others protest, they get the same treatment.\n\nWith Linda being carried away kicking and screaming, Simon takes on a group of cops all by himself and segments of his happier times in college flash before the viewers' eyes.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Bruce Davison]]: Simon\n* [[Kim Darby]]: Linda\n* [[Bud Cort]]: Elliott\n* [[Murray MacLeod]]: George\n* Tom Foral: The Coach\n* [[Bob Balaban]]: Elliott\n* [[Greta Pope]]: Song Leader\n==Production==\n[[Clay Felker]], editor of ''New York'' magazine, showed producer [[Irwin Winkler]] a column James Kunen had written and told him it was going to be a book (it would be published in 1969). He read it and bought the film rights with partner Bob Chartoff. \"We thought it could create understanding - the schism was so great between the generations then,\" said Winkler. \"It was an important subject.

Horovitz pitched the movie to MGM saying it should be shot at Columbia. \"At the time, there was a student group that had shot a lot of black and white documentary footage of the strikes at Columbia,\" he said. \"I wanted to intercut this documentary footage with the fiction that I planned to write. \"<ref name=\"play\">{{cite web|url=http://blog.tvstoreonline.com/2014/11/screenwriterplaywright-israel-horovitz.html|date=November 2014|title=Interview with Israel Hororvitz|website=TV Store Online}}</ref>\n\nThe pitch was successful at MGM announced they would make it in May 1969.<ref>And Now the Strawberries of Wrath\nBy A.

''[[The New York Times]]''. 54.</ref> [[Gene Siskel]] of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' gave the film two-and-a-half stars out of four and called it \"a movie with its heart, if not always its intelligence, in the right place ... The major problem with the film is that during the period before Simon James, a 20-year old student at Western Pacific university, is radicalized, neither his life style as a member of the college crew, nor the political movement on campus is very interesting. Director Stuart Hagman [sic], in his first feature effort, substitutes overly enthusiastic camera techniques and popular music played against the San Francisco scenery for a more complete character definition.\"<ref>Siskel, Gene (June 30, 1970). \"Strawberry\".

Part IV, p. 14.</ref> Gary Arnold of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' stated that the violent climax \"would be absurd even if it were well staged, because Hagmann and Horowitz haven't earned their catharsis. There is something howlingly inappropriate about a movie that turns 'angry' after an hour-and-a-half of puppy love, puppy protest and the confectionary audio-visual style pioneered by '[[A Man and a Woman]]' and '[[The Graduate]].' It's difficult to forget that the script has been fundamentally negligible and incompetent.\"<ref>Arnold, Gary (June 26, 1970). \"Strawberry Statement\". ''[[The Washington Post]]''. D7.</ref> [[David Pirie]] of ''[[The Monthly Film Bulletin]]'' wrote, \"''The Strawberry Statement'' is certain to be attacked for its patchiness and for hollow commercial opportunism; but while students are being killed on university campuses in America, one can't help preferring its highly emotional, if faltering and uneven, tone to the slick reportage of a film like ''[[Medium Cool]]''.\"<ref>{{cite journal |last=Pirie |first=David |date=July 1970 |title=The Strawberry Statement |journal=[[The Monthly Film Bulletin]] |volume=37 |issue=438 |page=142 }}</ref>\n\nHorovitz says when he saw the film \"I was really upset with it.

I'm glad I got to write it.\"<ref name=\"play\"/>\n\nAs a snapshot of its time, the film has collected many present-day fans, as [[David Sterritt]] writes for ''[[Turner Classic Movies]]'':<blockquote>Leonard Quart expressed a more measured view in ''[[Cineaste (magazine)|Cineaste]]'', writing that while ''The Strawberry Statement'' is basically a \"shallow, pop version of the Sixties,\" it still provides \"a taste of the period's dreams and volatility.\" That's a reasonable take on the film, which is more accurate than it may seem at first glance, depicting an uncertain time when many aspiring rebels were motivated as much by romance and excitement as by principles and ideologies.

Its setting is not [[Columbia University]] in New York City but a fictional university in [[Stockton, California]], which is based on San Francisco State College (later [[San Francisco State University]]).  [[Thunderclap Newman]]'s \"[[Something in the Air]]\" and numerous other rock songs are used on the [[soundtrack]].\n\n==Plot==\nSimon, a student at a fictional university in San Francisco is indifferent to the student protests around him, until walking in on a naked woman in his dormitory roommate's bed.

Following her into the university building the students are taking over, he joins the takeover just by being there. She approaches him while he boringly fools around in the toilets. She says her name is Linda and asks him to rob a food store with her so the striking students can eat.\n\nIn a later student protest, Simon is arrested. He then tells Linda he is not a radical like her. He does not want to \"blow the college building\" after doing his best to be accepted into the school in the first place. Linda later claims she can't see someone who is not likewise dedicated to the movement. Nevertheless, she announces temporarily leaving college to decide for sure.\n\nIn the showers, the rightist jock George beats up Simon, who decides to take advantage of the situation and use his injuries from George to fake [[police brutality]].

''[[The New York Times]]''. 54.</ref> [[Gene Siskel]] of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' gave the film two-and-a-half stars out of four and called it \"a movie with its heart, if not always its intelligence, in the right place ... The major problem with the film is that during the period before Simon James, a 20-year old student at Western Pacific university, is radicalized, neither his life style as a member of the college crew, nor the political movement on campus is very interesting. Director Stuart Hagman [sic], in his first feature effort, substitutes overly enthusiastic camera techniques and popular music played against the San Francisco scenery for a more complete character definition.\"<ref>Siskel, Gene (June 30, 1970). \"Strawberry\". ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''. Section 2, p. 5.</ref> [[Charles Champlin]] of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' wrote, \"I found 'The Strawberry Statement' inconsistent and uneven, all too glossy and yet suddenly all too real and populated with children I have no trouble recognizing as my own. And it's the true measure of the film that we are all likely to remember its best moments: The moments when we are made to see the terrible and ironic costs of innocence and idealism.\"<ref>Champlin, Charles (July 16, 1970). \"'Strawberry' Looks at Truth\". ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''. Part IV, p. 14.</ref> Gary Arnold of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' stated that the violent climax \"would be absurd even if it were well staged, because Hagmann and Horowitz haven't earned their catharsis. There is something howlingly inappropriate about a movie that turns 'angry' after an hour-and-a-half of puppy love, puppy protest and the confectionary audio-visual style pioneered by '[[A Man and a Woman]]' and '[[The Graduate]].' It's difficult to forget that the script has been fundamentally negligible and incompetent.\"<ref>Arnold, Gary (June 26, 1970). \"Strawberry Statement\". ''[[The Washington Post]]''. D7.</ref> [[David Pirie]] of ''[[The Monthly Film Bulletin]]'' wrote, \"''The Strawberry Statement'' is certain to be attacked for its patchiness and for hollow commercial opportunism; but while students are being killed on university campuses in America, one can't help preferring its highly emotional, if faltering and uneven, tone to the slick reportage of a film like ''[[Medium Cool]]''.\"<ref>{{cite journal |last=Pirie |first=David |date=July 1970 |title=The Strawberry Statement |journal=[[The Monthly Film Bulletin]] |volume=37 |issue=438 |page=142 }}</ref>\n\nHorovitz says when he saw the film \"I was really upset with it.

Polymer chains are held together in these materials by relatively weak [[molecule |intermolecular bonds]], which permit the polymers to stretch in response to macroscopic stresses. [[Natural rubber]], [[neoprene rubber]], [[buna-s]] and [[buna-n]] are all examples of such elastomers.\n\n[[File:Polymer picture.svg|thumb|upright|(A) is an unstressed polymer; (B) is the same polymer under stress. When the stress is removed, it will return to the A configuration. (The dots represent cross-links)]]\n\nElastomers are usually [[thermoset]]s (requiring [[vulcanization]]) but may also be [[thermoplastic]] (see [[thermoplastic elastomer]]).  The long polymer chains [[cross-link]] during curing, i.e., vulcanizing. The molecular structure of elastomers can be imagined as a 'spaghetti and meatball' structure, with the meatballs signifying cross-links. The elasticity is derived from the ability of the long chains to reconfigure themselves to distribute an applied stress. The covalent cross-linkages ensure that the elastomer will return to its original configuration when the stress is removed. As a result of this extreme flexibility, elastomers can reversibly extend from 5\u2013700%, depending on the specific material. Without the cross-linkages or with short, uneasily reconfigured chains, the applied stress would result in a permanent deformation.\n\nTemperature effects are also present in the demonstrated elasticity of a polymer. Elastomers that have cooled to a glassy or crystalline phase will have less mobile chains, and consequentially less elasticity, than those manipulated at temperatures higher than the glass transition temperature of the polymer.\n\nIt is also possible for a polymer to exhibit elasticity that is not due to covalent cross-links, but instead for  [[Thermodynamic theory of polymer elasticity|thermodynamic reasons]].\n\n==Examples==\n'''Unsaturated rubbers''' that can be cured by sulfur [[vulcanization]]:\n\n* [[terpene|Natural polyisoprene]]: cis-1,4-polyisoprene [[natural rubber]] (NR) and trans-1,4-polyisoprene [[gutta-percha]]\n\n* Synthetic polyisoprene (IR for [[isoprene]] rubber)\n* [[Polybutadiene]] (BR for [[butadiene]] rubber)\n* [[Chloroprene]] rubber (CR), [[polychloroprene]], [[Neoprene]], Baypren etc.\n* [[Butyl rubber]] (copolymer of [[isobutylene]] and isoprene, IIR)\n** [[Halogenation|Halogenated]] butyl rubbers (chloro butyl rubber: CIIR; bromo butyl rubber: BIIR)\n* [[Styrene-butadiene]] Rubber (copolymer of [[styrene]] and butadiene, SBR)\n* [[Nitrile rubber]] (copolymer of butadiene and [[acrylonitrile]], NBR), also called [[Plastic#Synthetic rubber|Buna N rubbers]]\n** [[Hydrogenation|Hydrogenated]] Nitrile Rubbers (HNBR) Therban and Zetpol\n(Unsaturated rubbers can also be cured by non-sulfur vulcanization if desired.)\n\n'''Saturated rubbers''' that cannot be cured by sulfur vulcanization:\n* EPM ('''[[ethylene propylene rubber]]''', a copolymer of [[ethylene]] and [[propylene]]) and [[EPDM rubber]] ('''ethylene propylene diene rubber''', a terpolymer of ethylene, propylene and a [[diene]]-component)\n* [[Epichlorohydrin]] rubber (ECO)\n* Polyacrylic rubber (ACM, ABR)\n* [[Silicone rubber]] (SI, Q, VMQ)\n* [[Fluorosilicone]] Rubber (FVMQ)\n* [[Fluoroelastomer]]s ([[FKM]], and FEPM) [[Viton]], [[Tecnoflon]], Fluorel, [[Aflas]] and Dai-El\n* Perfluoroelastomers ([[FFKM]]) [[Tecnoflon]] PFR, [[Kalrez]], Chemraz, Perlast\n* [[Polyether block amide]]s (PEBA)\n* Chlorosulfonated polyethylene (CSM), (Hypalon)\n* [[Ethylene-vinyl acetate]] (EVA)\n\n\"The definitions are not authentic as the Rubber which is classified in World Customs Organisation Books in Chapter 40, where as the above definitions stating all rubber and different polymers in same chapter which is classified in Chapter 39 of the World Custom Organisation's Harmonised Commodity for Description and coding system.

Polymer chains are held together in these materials by relatively weak [[molecule |intermolecular bonds]], which permit the polymers to stretch in response to macroscopic stresses. [[Natural rubber]], [[neoprene rubber]], [[buna-s]] and [[buna-n]] are all examples of such elastomers.\n\n[[File:Polymer picture.svg|thumb|upright|(A) is an unstressed polymer; (B) is the same polymer under stress. When the stress is removed, it will return to the A configuration. (The dots represent cross-links)]]\n\nElastomers are usually [[thermoset]]s (requiring [[vulcanization]]) but may also be [[thermoplastic]] (see [[thermoplastic elastomer]]).  The long polymer chains [[cross-link]] during curing, i.e., vulcanizing. The molecular structure of elastomers can be imagined as a 'spaghetti and meatball' structure, with the meatballs signifying cross-links. The elasticity is derived from the ability of the long chains to reconfigure themselves to distribute an applied stress. The covalent cross-linkages ensure that the elastomer will return to its original configuration when the stress is removed. As a result of this extreme flexibility, elastomers can reversibly extend from 5\u2013700%, depending on the specific material. Without the cross-linkages or with short, uneasily reconfigured chains, the applied stress would result in a permanent deformation.\n\nTemperature effects are also present in the demonstrated elasticity of a polymer. Elastomers that have cooled to a glassy or crystalline phase will have less mobile chains, and consequentially less elasticity, than those manipulated at temperatures higher than the glass transition temperature of the polymer.\n\nIt is also possible for a polymer to exhibit elasticity that is not due to covalent cross-links, but instead for  [[Thermodynamic theory of polymer elasticity|thermodynamic reasons]].\n\n==Examples==\n'''Unsaturated rubbers''' that can be cured by sulfur [[vulcanization]]:* [[terpene|Natural polyisoprene]]: cis-1,4-polyisoprene [[natural rubber]] (NR) and trans-1,4-polyisoprene [[gutta-percha]]\n* Synthetic polyisoprene (IR for [[isoprene]] rubber)\n* [[Polybutadiene]] (BR for [[butadiene]] rubber)\n* [[Chloroprene]] rubber (CR), [[polychloroprene]], [[Neoprene]], Baypren etc.\n* [[Butyl rubber]] (copolymer of [[isobutylene]] and isoprene, IIR)\n** [[Halogenation|Halogenated]] butyl rubbers (chloro butyl rubber: CIIR; bromo butyl rubber: BIIR)\n* [[Styrene-butadiene]] Rubber (copolymer of [[styrene]] and butadiene, SBR)\n* [[Nitrile rubber]] (copolymer of butadiene and [[acrylonitrile]], NBR), also called [[Plastic#Synthetic rubber|Buna N rubbers]]\n** [[Hydrogenation|Hydrogenated]] Nitrile Rubbers (HNBR) Therban and Zetpol\n(Unsaturated rubbers can also be cured by non-sulfur vulcanization if desired.)\n\n'''Saturated rubbers''' that cannot be cured by sulfur vulcanization:\n* EPM ('''[[ethylene propylene rubber]]''', a copolymer of [[ethylene]] and [[propylene]]) and [[EPDM rubber]] ('''ethylene propylene diene rubber''', a terpolymer of ethylene, propylene and a [[diene]]-component)\n* [[Epichlorohydrin]] rubber (ECO)\n* Polyacrylic rubber (ACM, ABR)\n* [[Silicone rubber]] (SI, Q, VMQ)\n* [[Fluorosilicone]] Rubber (FVMQ)\n* [[Fluoroelastomer]]s ([[FKM]], and FEPM) [[Viton]], [[Tecnoflon]], Fluorel, [[Aflas]] and Dai-El\n* Perfluoroelastomers ([[FFKM]]) [[Tecnoflon]] PFR, [[Kalrez]], Chemraz, Perlast\n* [[Polyether block amide]]s (PEBA)\n* Chlorosulfonated polyethylene (CSM), (Hypalon)\n* [[Ethylene-vinyl acetate]] (EVA)\n\n\"The definitions are not authentic as the Rubber which is classified in World Customs Organisation Books in Chapter 40, where as the above definitions stating all rubber and different polymers in same chapter which is classified in Chapter 39 of the World Custom Organisation's Harmonised Commodity for Description and coding system.

She studied zoology at the [[University of Oxford]], gaining an MA.\n\n== Research and career ==\n\n=== Institute of Animal Genetics ===\nClayton joined the Institute of Animal Genetics (University of Edinburgh) in 1947 at a time of rapid expansion under the leadership of the biologist and polymath C.H. Waddington.<ref name=\"Truman2003\" /> She was one of the original group of scientists there during the 1950s that included notable figures such as [[Charlotte Auerbach]], [[Geoffrey Beale]], [[Douglas Scott Falconer]], [[Henrik Kacser]], Eric Lucey, Eric Reeve, and [[Alan Robertson (geneticist)|Alan Robertson]]. Waddington\u2019s initial solution to staff accommodation problems in Edinburgh was the acquisition of the nearby Mortonhall and an experiment in collegiate living, from which Eric Reeve\u2019s wife, the artist [[Edith Simon]] drew inspiration for her novel The Past Masters (titled House of Strangers in the USA).<ref>Simon, E.

The eye in general and in particular the abundant proteins of the [[eye lens]], which are termed [[crystallin]]s provided Clayton and her colleague DES Truman with an ideal system in which to investigate the link between [[gene expression]] and [[cell differentiation]] during [[embryonic development]]. The complexity of crystallin protein composition and expression were explored by early adoption of a wide range of innovative immunological,<ref>Clayton RM.

Surprisingly, embryonic chick retinal cells can also differentiate into lens cells under certain conditions when grown isolated in culture; a rare example of the [[transdifferentiation]] of one differentiated cell type into another, and a phenomenon that is thought to relate to the capacity of certain species to undergo [[lens regeneration]].

Rodent models and cell cultures were used to assess the potentially deleterious effects on foetal neural development of low-level exposure to pharmaceuticals and environmental contaminants during pregnancy.
