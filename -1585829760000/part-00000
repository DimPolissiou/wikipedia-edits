During the Celtic period it was one of the two administrative centres of the Cantiaci tribe. During the [[Roman conquest of Britain]] a decisive battle was fought at the Medway somewhere near Rochester.  The first bridge was subsequently constructed early in the Roman period.  During the later Roman period the settlement was walled in stone. [[\u00c6thelberht of Kent|King Ethelbert of Kent]] (560\u2013616) established a legal system which has been preserved in the 12th century ''[[Textus Roffensis]]''.  In AD 604 the bishopric and cathedral were founded.  During this period, from the recall of the legions until the [[Norman conquest]], Rochester was sacked at least twice and besieged on another occasion.\n\nThe [[Middle Ages|medieval period]] saw the building of the current cathedral (1080\u20131130, 1227 and 1343), the building of two castles and the establishment of a significant town.  Rochester Castle saw action in the sieges of 1215 and 1264. Its basic street plan was set out, constrained by the river, Watling Street, Rochester Priory and the [[Rochester Castle|castle]].\n\nRochester has produced two martyrs: [[John Fisher|St John Fisher]], executed by [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] for refusing to sanction the divorce of [[Catherine of Aragon]]; and [[Nicholas Ridley (martyr)|Bishop Nicholas Ridley]], executed by [[Mary I of England|Queen Mary]] for being an [[English Reformation]] [[protestant]].\n\nThe city was raided by the Dutch as part of the [[Second Anglo-Dutch War]].  The Dutch, commanded by [[de Ruijter|Admiral de Ruijter]], broke through the [[Coastal defence and fortification|chain]] at [[Upnor]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fortified-places.com/upnor.html|title=Fortified Places > Fortresses > Upnor Castle|website=www.fortified-places.com}}</ref> and sailed to Rochester Bridge capturing part of the English fleet and burning it.<ref name=Dutch>*The Dutch Raid, published by the City of Rochester Society 1998.</ref>\n\n[[File:Rochester Castle engraved by H.Adlard after G.F.Sargent. c1836 edited.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.2|Rochester Castle from across the [[River Medway|Medway]] (engraving, G.F. Sargent c. 1836)]]\n\n===Military history===\n{{further|The Nore}}\nRochester has for centuries been of great strategic importance through its position near the confluence of the [[River Thames|Thames]] and the [[River Medway|Medway]]. [[Rochester Castle]] was built to guard the river crossing, and the Royal Dockyard's establishment at [[Chatham, Kent|Chatham]] witnessed the beginning of the [[Royal Navy]]'s long period of supremacy. The town, as part of Medway, is surrounded by two circles of [[fortress]]es; the inner line built during the [[Napoleonic wars]] consists of [[Fort Clarence]], [[Fort Pitt, Kent|Fort Pitt]], [[Fort Amherst]] and [[Fort Gillingham]]. The outer line of [[Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Palmerston Forts]] was built during the 1860s in light of the report by the [[Royal Commission on the Defence of the United Kingdom]] and consists of [[Fort Borstal]], [[Fort Bridgewood]], [[Fort Luton]], and the [[Twydall|Twydall Redoubts]], with two additional forts on islands in the Medway, namely [[Fort Hoo]] and [[Fort Darnet]].\n\nDuring the [[First World War]] the [[Short Brothers]]' [[Fixed-wing aircraft|aircraft]] manufacturing company developed the first plane to launch a torpedo, the [[Short Type 184|Short Admiralty Type 184]], at its seaplane factory on the River Medway not far from Rochester Castle. In the intervening period between the 20th century World Wars the company established a world-wide reputation as a constructor of flying boats with aircraft such as the [[Short Singapore|Singapore]], [[Short Empire|Empire]] 'C'-Class and [[Short Sunderland|Sunderland]]. During the [[Second World War]], Shorts also designed and manufactured the first four-engined [[bomber]], the [[Short Stirling|Stirling]].\n\nThe [[UK]]'s decline in naval power and shipbuilding competitiveness led to the government decommissioning the RN Shipyard at Chatham in 1984, which led to the subsequent demise of much local maritime industry. Rochester and its neighbouring communities were hit hard by this and have experienced a painful adjustment to a [[post-industrial economy]], with much social deprivation and unemployment resulting. On the closure of Chatham Dockyard the area experienced an unprecedented surge in unemployment to 24%; this had dropped to 2.4% of the local population by 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-kent-26793760|title=Chatham Dockyard closure 'very positive for the area'|date=31 March 2014|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref>\n\n===Civic history and traditions===\nRochester was recognised as a City from 1211 to 1998. The City of Rochester's ancient status was unique, as it had no formal council or Charter Trustees nor a Mayor, instead having the office of Admiral of the River Medway '''hi'''''Italic text'', whose incumbent acted as ''de facto'' civic leader.<ref name=\"LondonGazette48875\">{{London Gazette|issue=48875|page=1173|date=28 January 1982}} Publishing Letters Patent dated 25 January 1982, text also available from [http://cityark.medway.gov.uk/ Medway Council archives website]</ref>\n\nSince Norman times Rochester had always governed land on the other side of the [[River Medway|Medway]] in [[Strood]], which was known as ''Strood [[Intra (disambiguation)|Intra]]''; before 1835 it was about {{convert|100|yards}} wide and stretched to Gun Lane. In the [[1835 Municipal Corporations Act]] the boundaries were extended to include more of Strood and Frindsbury, and part of Chatham known as ''Chatham Intra''.\n\nLike many of the mediaeval towns of England, Rochester had civic [[Freedom of the City|Freemen]] whose historic duties and rights were abolished by the [[Municipal Corporations Act 1835]]. However, the ''[[Guild]] of Free Fishers and Dredgers'' continues to the present day and retains rights, duties and responsibilities on the Medway, between Sheerness and Hawkwood Stone.<ref>[http://www.freemen-few.org.uk/UserControls/FCKEditor/.../ROCHESTER.doc ]{{dead link|date=July 2018}}</ref> This ancient corporate body convenes at the Admiralty Court whose [[Jury]] of Freemen is responsible for the conservancy of the River as enshrined in current legislation. The City Freedom can be obtained by residents after serving a period of \"servitude\", i.e. [[apprenticeship]] (traditionally seven years), before admission as a Freeman. The annual ceremonial [[beating the bounds|Beating of the Bounds]] by the River Medway takes place after the Admiralty Court, usually on the first Saturday of July.\n\n===Ecclesiastical parishes===\n[[File:Diocese of Rochester arms.svg|thumb|right|upright=0.5|Arms of diocese of Rochester]]{{for| parishes in the wider Rochester area |Strood#Churches|Frindsbury#The Church of All Saints}}\nThere were three medieval [[parish]]es: St Nicholas', [[St. Margaret's Church, Rochester|St Margaret's]] and St Clement's.

The two commonly cited origins of this name are that it either came from \"stronghold by the bridge(s)\"<ref name=Glover>The Place names of Kent.

In later times, the word ''[[caester|c\u00e6ster]]'' (=castle, from Latin ''castrum'') was added to the name and the city was called ''Robrivis C\u00e6ster''. [[Bede]] mentions the city in ca. 730 and calls it ''Hrofes c\u00e6ster'', mistaking its meaning as Hrofi's fortified camp. From this we get c. 730 Hrof\u00e6sc\u00e6stre, 811 Hrofescester, 1086 Rovescester, 1610 Rochester.<ref name=Glover/> The Latinised adjective 'Roffensis' refers to Rochester.<ref name=Kellys/><!-- Should be in history- but that is fairly full and should only be a synopsis of the main article-- see [[Wikipedia:WikiProject UK geography/How to write about settlements]] for guidance-->\n\n==History==\n{{main|History of Rochester, Kent}}\n\n[[File:Eastgate House, Rochester, Kent - geograph.org.uk - 1582490.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.95|Eastgate House, Rochester, Kent]]\nNeolithic remains have been found in the vicinity of Rochester; over time it has been variously occupied by [[Celts]], [[Ancient Rome|Romans]], [[Jutes]] and/or [[Saxons]]. During the Celtic period it was one of the two administrative centres of the Cantiaci tribe. During the [[Roman conquest of Britain]] a decisive battle was fought at the Medway somewhere near Rochester.  The first bridge was subsequently constructed early in the Roman period.  During the later Roman period the settlement was walled in stone. [[\u00c6thelberht of Kent|King Ethelbert of Kent]] (560\u2013616) established a legal system which has been preserved in the 12th century ''[[Textus Roffensis]]''.  In AD 604 the bishopric and cathedral were founded.  During this period, from the recall of the legions until the [[Norman conquest]], Rochester was sacked at least twice and besieged on another occasion.\n\nThe [[Middle Ages|medieval period]] saw the building of the current cathedral (1080\u20131130, 1227 and 1343), the building of two castles and the establishment of a significant town.  Rochester Castle saw action in the sieges of 1215 and 1264. Its basic street plan was set out, constrained by the river, Watling Street, Rochester Priory and the [[Rochester Castle|castle]].\n\nRochester has produced two martyrs: [[John Fisher|St John Fisher]], executed by [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]] for refusing to sanction the divorce of [[Catherine of Aragon]]; and [[Nicholas Ridley (martyr)|Bishop Nicholas Ridley]], executed by [[Mary I of England|Queen Mary]] for being an [[English Reformation]] [[protestant]].\n\nThe city was raided by the Dutch as part of the [[Second Anglo-Dutch War]].  The Dutch, commanded by [[de Ruijter|Admiral de Ruijter]], broke through the [[Coastal defence and fortification|chain]] at [[Upnor]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fortified-places.com/upnor.html|title=Fortified Places > Fortresses > Upnor Castle|website=www.fortified-places.com}}</ref> and sailed to Rochester Bridge capturing part of the English fleet and burning it.<ref name=Dutch>*The Dutch Raid, published by the City of Rochester Society 1998.</ref>\n\n[[File:Rochester Castle engraved by H.Adlard after G.F.Sargent. c1836 edited.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.2|Rochester Castle from across the [[River Medway|Medway]] (engraving, G.F. Sargent c. 1836)]]\n\n===Military history===\n{{further|The Nore}}\nRochester has for centuries been of great strategic importance through its position near the confluence of the [[River Thames|Thames]] and the [[River Medway|Medway]]. [[Rochester Castle]] was built to guard the river crossing, and the Royal Dockyard's establishment at [[Chatham, Kent|Chatham]] witnessed the beginning of the [[Royal Navy]]'s long period of supremacy. The town, as part of Medway, is surrounded by two circles of [[fortress]]es; the inner line built during the [[Napoleonic wars]] consists of [[Fort Clarence]], [[Fort Pitt, Kent|Fort Pitt]], [[Fort Amherst]] and [[Fort Gillingham]]. The outer line of [[Henry John Temple, 3rd Viscount Palmerston|Palmerston Forts]] was built during the 1860s in light of the report by the [[Royal Commission on the Defence of the United Kingdom]] and consists of [[Fort Borstal]], [[Fort Bridgewood]], [[Fort Luton]], and the [[Twydall|Twydall Redoubts]], with two additional forts on islands in the Medway, namely [[Fort Hoo]] and [[Fort Darnet]].\n\nDuring the [[First World War]] the [[Short Brothers]]' [[Fixed-wing aircraft|aircraft]] manufacturing company developed the first plane to launch a torpedo, the [[Short Type 184|Short Admiralty Type 184]], at its seaplane factory on the River Medway not far from Rochester Castle. In the intervening period between the 20th century World Wars the company established a world-wide reputation as a constructor of flying boats with aircraft such as the [[Short Singapore|Singapore]], [[Short Empire|Empire]] 'C'-Class and [[Short Sunderland|Sunderland]]. During the [[Second World War]], Shorts also designed and manufactured the first four-engined [[bomber]], the [[Short Stirling|Stirling]].\n\nThe [[UK]]'s decline in naval power and shipbuilding competitiveness led to the government decommissioning the RN Shipyard at Chatham in 1984, which led to the subsequent demise of much local maritime industry. Rochester and its neighbouring communities were hit hard by this and have experienced a painful adjustment to a [[post-industrial economy]], with much social deprivation and unemployment resulting. On the closure of Chatham Dockyard the area experienced an unprecedented surge in unemployment to 24%; this had dropped to 2.4% of the local population by 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-kent-26793760|title=Chatham Dockyard closure 'very positive for the area'|date=31 March 2014|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref>\n\n===Civic history and traditions===\nRochester was recognised as a City from 1211 to 1998. The City of Rochester's ancient status was unique, as it had no formal council or Charter Trustees nor a Mayor, instead having the office of Admiral of the River Medway, whose incumbent acted as ''de facto'' civic leader.<ref name=\"LondonGazette48875\">{{London Gazette|issue=48875|page=1173|date=28 January 1982}} Publishing Letters Patent dated 25 January 1982, text also available from [http://cityark.medway.gov.uk/ Medway Council archives website]</ref>\n\nSince Norman times Rochester had always governed land on the other side of the [[River Medway|Medway]] in [[Strood]], which was known as ''Strood [[Intra (disambiguation)|Intra]]''; before 1835 it was about {{convert|100|yards}} wide and stretched to Gun Lane. In the [[1835 Municipal Corporations Act]] the boundaries were extended to include more of Strood and Frindsbury, and part of Chatham known as ''Chatham Intra''.\n\nLike many of the mediaeval towns of England, Rochester had civic [[Freedom of the City|Freemen]] whose historic duties and rights were abolished by the [[Municipal Corporations Act 1835]]. However, the ''[[Guild]] of Free Fishers and Dredgers'' continues to the present day and retains rights, duties and responsibilities on the Medway, between Sheerness and Hawkwood Stone.<ref>[http://www.freemen-few.org.uk/UserControls/FCKEditor/.../ROCHESTER.doc ]{{dead link|date=July 2018}}</ref> This ancient corporate body convenes at the Admiralty Court whose [[Jury]] of Freemen is responsible for the conservancy of the River as enshrined in current legislation. The City Freedom can be obtained by residents after serving a period of \"servitude\", i.e. [[apprenticeship]] (traditionally seven years), before admission as a Freeman. The annual ceremonial [[beating the bounds|Beating of the Bounds]] by the River Medway takes place after the Admiralty Court, usually on the first Saturday of July.\n\n===Ecclesiastical parishes===\n[[File:Diocese of Rochester arms.svg|thumb|right|upright=0.5|Arms of diocese of Rochester]]{{for| parishes in the wider Rochester area |Strood#Churches|Frindsbury#The Church of All Saints}}\nThere were three medieval [[parish]]es: St Nicholas', [[St. Margaret's Church, Rochester|St Margaret's]] and St Clement's.  St Clement's was in Horsewash Lane until the last vicar died in 1538 when it was joined with St Nicholas' parish;  the church's last remaining foundations were finally removed when the railway was being constructed in the 1850s. [[St Nicholas' Church, Rochester|St Nicholas' Church]] was built in 1421 beside the [[Rochester Cathedral|cathedral]] to serve as a parish church for the citizens of Rochester.

The scene was filmed in front of a live audience at the [[Greek Theatre (Los Angeles)|Greek Theater]] in [[Los Angeles]], California.\n\n\"Shallow\" is a pivotal moment in ''A Star Is Born'', since it speaks about Ally and Jackson's conversations. Gaga wrote it from Ally's point of view with the self-aware lyrics asking each other if they are content being who they are.

Seeing the first trailer for the film, Ronson decided not to refine the track anymore and kept it as the final mix.

{"title_page": "Proto-Celtic language", "text_new": "{{short description|Ancestor of the Celtic languages}}\n{{Indo-European topics}}\n\nThe '''Proto-Celtic language''', also called '''Common Celtic''', is the partially [[reconstructed language|reconstructed ancestor language]] of all the known [[Celtic languages]]. Its [[lexis (linguistics)|lexis]], or vocabulary, can be confidently reconstructed on the basis of the [[comparative method]] of [[historical linguistics]], in the same manner as [[Proto-Indo-European]] or PIE, the ancient language which has been most thoroughly re-constructed. Proto-Celtic is a descendant of the Proto-Indo-European language and is itself the ancestor of the [[Celtic languages]] which are members of the modern [[Indo-European language family]], the most commonly spoken language family. Modern Celtic languages share common features with [[Italic languages]] that are unseen in other branches and according to one theory they may have formed an ancient [[Italo-Celtic]] branch. The duration of the cultures speaking Proto-Celtic was relatively brief compared to PIE\u2019s 2,000 years. The earliest archaeological culture that may justifiably be considered as Proto-Celtic is the Late Bronze Age [[Urnfield culture]] of [[Central Europe]] c.1300 BCE.<ref name=ChadCorc>{{cite book|last=Chadwick with Corcoran|first=Nora with J.X.W.P.|title=The Celts|year=1970|publisher=Penguin Books|pages=28\u201333}}</ref> By the Iron Age [[Hallstatt culture]] of around 800 BC these people had become fully [[Celts|Celtic]].<ref name=ChadCorc/>\n\nThe reconstruction of Proto-Celtic is currently being undertaken, by necessity relying on later iterations of Celtic languages. Although [[Continental Celtic]] presents much substantiation for Proto-Celtic\u2019s [[phonology]], and some for its [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], recorded material is too scanty to allow a secure reconstruction of [[syntax]], although some complete sentences are recorded in the Continental [[Gaulish language|Gaulish]] and [[Celtiberian language|Celtiberian]].  Therefore, the primary sources for reconstruction come from the [[Insular Celtic languages]] with the oldest [[literature]] found in [[Old Irish]]<ref>[https://www.britannica.com/art/Celtic-literature#ref42288 Celtic literature] at britannica.com, accessed 7 February 2018</ref> and [[Middle Welsh]],<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Rhys|first1=John|editor1-last=Evans|editor1-first=E.

Similar developments appear in Italic, but for the syllabic nasals *m\u0325, *n\u0325, the result is Proto-Italic *\u0259m, *\u0259n (> Latin ''em'' ~ ''im'', ''en'' ~ ''in'').\n* Word-initially, HR\u0325C > aRC\n* Before voiceless stops, CR\u0325HT > CRaT\n* CR\u0325HV > CaRHV\n* CR\u0325HC > CR\u0101C\n\n===Early Proto-Celtic===\n* Sequences of velar and *w merge into the labiovelars (it is uncertain if this preceded or followed the next change; that is, whether gw > b or gw > g\u02b7):\n** kw > k\u02b7\n** gw > g\u02b7\n** g\u02b0w > g\u02b7\u02b0\n* g\u02b7 > b\n* Aspirated stops lose their aspiration and merge with the voiced stops (except that this [[feeding order|counterfeeds]] the previous change, so *g\u02b7\u02b0 > *g\u02b7 doesn't result in a merger):\n** b\u02b0 > b\n** d\u02b0 > d\n** g\u02b0 > g\n** g\u02b7\u02b0 > g\u02b7\n* *e before a resonant and *a (but not *\u0101) becomes *a as well (eRa > aRa): *\u01f5\u02b0elH-ro > *gelaro > *galaro / *g\u00e9rH-no > *gerano > *garano (Joseph's rule).\n* Epenthetic *i is inserted after syllabic liquids when followed by a plosive:\n** l\u0325T > liT\n** r\u0325T > riT\n* Epenthetic *a is inserted before the remaining syllabic resonants:\n** m\u0325 > am\n** n\u0325 > an\n** l\u0325 > al\n** r\u0325 > ar\n* All remaining nonsyllabic laryngeals are lost.\n* \u0113 > \u012b\n* \u014d > \u016b in final syllables\n* Long vowels are shortened before a syllable-final resonant (V:RC > VRC); this also shortens long diphthongs.

So the Proto-Indo-European [[voiced consonant|voiced]] aspirated stops *{{PIE|''b\u02b0''}}, *{{PIE|''d\u02b0''}}, *{{PIE|''g\u02b0/\u01f5\u02b0''}} merged with *{{PIE|''b''}}, *{{PIE|''d''}}, *{{PIE|''g/\u01f5''}}. The voiced aspirate [[Labialized velar consonant|labiovelar]] *{{PIE|''g\u02b7\u02b0''}} did not merge with *{{PIE|''g\u02b7''}}, though: plain *{{PIE|''g\u02b7''}} became *{{PIE|''b''}} in Proto-Celtic, while aspirated *{{PIE|''g\u02b7\u02b0''}} became *{{PIE|''g\u02b7''}}. Thus, PIE *{{PIE|''g\u02b7en-''}} 'woman' became Old Irish ''ben'' and Old Welsh ''ben'', but PIE *{{PIE|''g\u02b7\u02b0n\u0325-''}} 'to kill, to wound' became Old Irish ''gonaid'' and Welsh ''gwanu''.\n\nProto-Indo-European *{{PIE|''p''}} was lost in Proto-Celtic, apparently going through the stages *{{PIE|''\u0278''}} (as in the table above) and *{{PIE|''h''}} (perhaps attested by the [[toponym]] [[Hercynian Forest|Hercynia]] if this is of Celtic origin) before being lost completely word-initially and between vowels. Adjacent to consonants, Proto-Celtic *{{PIE|''\u0278''}} underwent different changes: the [[consonant cluster|clusters]] *{{PIE|''\u0278s''}} and *{{PIE|''\u0278t''}} became *{{PIE|''xs''}} and *{{PIE|''xt''}} respectively already in Proto-Celtic. PIE *{{PIE|''sp-''}} became Old Irish ''s'' (lenited ''f-'', exactly as for PIE *{{PIE|''sw-''}}) and Brythonic ''f''; while {{harvnb|Schrijver|1995|p=348}} argues there was an intermediate stage *{{PIE|''s\u0278-''}} (in which *{{PIE|\u0278}} remained an independent phoneme until after Proto-Insular Celtic had diverged into Goidelic and Brythonic), {{harvnb|McCone|1996|pp=44\u201345}} finds it more economical to believe that *{{PIE|''sp-''}} remained unchanged in PC, that is, the change *{{PIE|''p''}} to *{{PIE|''\u0278''}} did not happen when *{{PIE|''s''}} preceded. (Similarly, [[Grimm's law]] did not apply to ''*p, t, k'' after *''s'' in [[Proto-Germanic language|Germanic]], and later the same exception occurred again in the [[High German consonant shift]].)\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!

Consequently, one finds Gaulish ''petuar[ios]'', [[Welsh language|Welsh]] ''pedwar'' \"four\", compared to [[Old Irish language|Old Irish]] ''cethair'' and [[Latin]] ''quattuor''. Insofar as this new {{IPA|/p/}} fills the space in the phoneme inventory which was lost by the disappearance of the equivalent stop in PIE, we may think of this as a [[chain shift]].\n\nThe terms '''P-Celtic''' and '''Q-Celtic''' are useful when we wish to group the Celtic languages according to the way they handle this one phoneme.  However a simple division into P- and Q-Celtic may be untenable, as it does not do justice to the evidence of the ancient [[Continental Celtic languages]]. The large number of unusual shared innovations among the [[Insular Celtic languages]] are often also presented as evidence against a P-Celtic ''vs'' Q-Celtic division, but they may instead reflect a common [[substratum]] influence from the pre-Celtic languages of Britain and Ireland,[http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/288/5469/1158], or simply continuing contact between the insular languages; in either case they would be irrelevant to Celtic language classification in the genetic sense.\n\nQ-Celtic languages may also have {{IPA|/p/}} in loan words, though in early borrowings from Welsh into Primitive Irish {{IPA|/k\u02b7/}} was used by sound substitution due to a lack of a {{IPA|/p/}} phoneme at the time:\n*Latin ''Patricius'' \"[[Saint Patrick]]\"' > Welsh > Primitive Irish {{sm|Qatrikias}} > Old Irish ''Cothrige'', later [[Saint Patrick|''P\u00e1draig'']];\n*Latin ''[[presbyter]]'' \"priest\" > early form of word seen in [[Old Welsh]] ''premter primter'' > Primitive Irish {{sm|qrimitir}} > Old Irish ''cruimther''.\nGaelic ''p\u00f3g'' \"kiss\" was a later borrowing (from the second word of the Latin phrase ''osculum pacis'' \"kiss of peace\") at a stage where ''p'' was borrowed directly as ''p'', without substituting ''c''.\n\n===Vowels===\nThe Proto-Celtic vowel system is highly comparable to that reconstructed for [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] by [[Antoine Meillet]]. The following [[monophthong]]s have been reconstructed:\n:{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:40%\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Type\n! colspan=\"2\" | [[Front vowel|Front]]\n! colspan=\"2\" | [[Central vowel|Central]]\n! colspan=\"2\" | [[Back vowel|Back]]\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! long\n! short\n! long\n! short\n! long\n! short\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!

Proto-Celtic is believed to have had nouns in three [[grammatical gender|genders]], three [[grammatical number|numbers]] and five to eight cases. The genders were the normal masculine, feminine and neuter, the three numbers were singular, plural and dual. The number of cases is a subject of contention:<ref>{{cite book |author=Pedersen, Holger |title=Vergleichende Grammatik der keltischen Sprachen, 2.

These cases were [[nominative]], [[vocative]], [[accusative]], [[dative]], [[genitive]], [[ablative]], [[locative]] and [[instrumental case|instrumental]].\n\nNouns fall into nine or so declensions, depending on the stem. There are *''o''-stems, *''\u0101''-stems, *''i''-stems, *''u''-stems, dental stems, velar stems, nasal stems, *''r''-stems and *''s''-stems.\n\n====*''o''-stem nouns====\n*''makk\u02b7os'' 'son' (masculine) ([[Old Irish]] ''mac'' ~ [[Welsh language|Welsh]], [[Cornish language|Cornish]] and [[Breton language|Breton]] ''mab'')\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!

Gaulish ''delgu'' \"I hold\", Old Irish ''tongu'' \"I swear\"\n* [[Imperative mood|imperative]] \u2014 seen in e.g. 3rd sg. Celtiberian ''usabituz'', Gaulish ''appisetu''\n* [[Subjunctive mood|subjunctive]] \u2014 seen in e.g. 3rd sg. Gaulish ''buetid'' \"may he be\", Celtiberian ''asekati''\nand four tenses:\n* [[Present tense|present]] \u2014 seen in e.g. Gaulish ''uedi\u00edu-mi'' \"I pray\", Celtiberian ''zizonti'' \"they sow\"\n* [[preterite]] \u2014 seen in e.g. 3rd sg. Gaulish ''sioxti'', Lepontic ''<small>K</small>ari<small>T</small>e''\n* [[imperfect]] \u2014 perhaps in Celtiberian ''kombalkez'', ''atibion''\n* [[Future tense|future]] \u2014 seen in e.g. 3rd sg. Gaulish ''bissiet'', Old Irish ''bieid'' \"he shall be\"\nA probable [[optative mood]] also features in Gaulish (''tixsintor'') and an [[infinitive]] (with a characteristic ending ''-unei'') in Celtiberian.<ref>Stefan Schumacher, ''Die keltischen Prim\u00e4rverben: Ein vergleichendes, etymologisches und morphologisches Lexikon'' (Innsbruck: Institut f\u00fcr Sprachen und Literaturen der Universit\u00e4t, 2004).</ref><ref>Pierre-Yves Lambert, ''La langue gauloise: Description linguistique, commentaire d'inscriptions choisies'' (Paris: Errance, revised ed. 2003).</ref>\n\nVerbs were formed by adding [[suffix]]es to a [[verb]]al [[Word stem|stem]].

Modern Celtic languages share common features with [[Italic languages]] that are unseen in other branches and according to one theory they may have formed an ancient [[Italo-Celtic]] branch. The duration of the cultures speaking Proto-Celtic was relatively brief compared to PIE\u2019s 2,000 years. The earliest archaeological culture that may justifiably be considered as Proto-Celtic is the Late Bronze Age [[Urnfield culture]] of [[Central Europe]] c.1300 BCE.<ref name=ChadCorc>{{cite book|last=Chadwick with Corcoran|first=Nora with J.X.W.P.|title=The Celts|year=1970|publisher=Penguin Books|pages=28\u201333}}</ref> By the Iron Age [[Hallstatt culture]] of around 800 BC these people had become fully [[Celts|Celtic]].<ref name=ChadCorc/>\n\nThe reconstruction of Proto-Celtic is currently being undertaken, by necessity relying on later iterations of Celtic languages. Although [[Continental Celtic]] presents much substantiation for Proto-Celtic\u2019s [[phonology]], and some for its [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], recorded material is too scanty to allow a secure reconstruction of [[syntax]], although some complete sentences are recorded in the Continental [[Gaulish language|Gaulish]] and [[Celtiberian language|Celtiberian]].

Thus, PIE *{{PIE|''g\u02b7en-''}} 'woman' became Old Irish ''ben'' and Old Welsh ''ben'', but PIE *{{PIE|''g\u02b7\u02b0n\u0325-''}} 'to kill, to wound' became Old Irish ''gonaid'' and Welsh ''gwanu''.\n\nProto-Indo-European *{{PIE|''p''}} was lost in Proto-Celtic, apparently going through the stages *{{PIE|''\u0278''}} (as in the table above) and *{{PIE|''h''}} (perhaps attested by the [[toponym]] [[Hercynian Forest|Hercynia]] if this is of Celtic origin) before being lost completely word-initially and between vowels. Adjacent to consonants, Proto-Celtic *{{PIE|''\u0278''}} underwent different changes: the [[consonant cluster|clusters]] *{{PIE|''\u0278s''}} and *{{PIE|''\u0278t''}} became *{{PIE|''xs''}} and *{{PIE|''xt''}} respectively already in Proto-Celtic. PIE *{{PIE|''sp-''}} became Old Irish ''s'' (lenited ''f-'', exactly as for PIE *{{PIE|''sw-''}}) and Brythonic ''f''; while {{harvnb|Schrijver|1995|p=348}} argues there was an intermediate stage *{{PIE|''s\u0278-''}} (in which *{{PIE|\u0278}} remained an independent phoneme until after Proto-Insular Celtic had diverged into Goidelic and Brythonic), {{harvnb|McCone|1996|pp=44\u201345}} finds it more economical to believe that *{{PIE|''sp-''}} remained unchanged in PC, that is, the change *{{PIE|''p''}} to *{{PIE|''\u0278''}} did not happen when *{{PIE|''s''}} preceded. (Similarly, [[Grimm's law]] did not apply to ''*p, t, k'' after *''s'' in [[Proto-Germanic language|Germanic]], and later the same exception occurred again in the [[High German consonant shift]].)\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n! Proto-Celtic\n! Old Irish\n! Welsh\n|-\n| *{{PIE|la\u0278s-}} > *{{PIE|laxs-}} 'shine'\n| ''las-aid''\n| ''llach-ar''\n|-\n| *{{PIE|se\u0278tam}} > *{{PIE|sextam}} 'seven'\n| ''secht''\n| ''saith''\n|-\n| *{{PIE|s\u0278eret-}} or *{{PIE|speret-}} 'heel'\n| ''seir''\n| ''ff\u00ear''\n|}\n\nIn [[Gaulish language|Gaulish]] and the [[Brythonic languages]], a new *{{PIE|''p''}} sound has arisen as a reflex of the Proto-Indo-European *{{PIE|''k\u02b7''}} phoneme. Consequently, one finds Gaulish ''petuar[ios]'', [[Welsh language|Welsh]] ''pedwar'' \"four\", compared to [[Old Irish language|Old Irish]] ''cethair'' and [[Latin]] ''quattuor''. Insofar as this new {{IPA|/p/}} fills the space in the phoneme inventory which was lost by the disappearance of the equivalent stop in PIE, we may think of this as a [[chain shift]].\n\nThe terms '''P-Celtic''' and '''Q-Celtic''' are useful when we wish to group the Celtic languages according to the way they handle this one phoneme.  However a simple division into P- and Q-Celtic may be untenable, as it does not do justice to the evidence of the ancient [[Continental Celtic languages]]. The large number of unusual shared innovations among the [[Insular Celtic languages]] are often also presented as evidence against a P-Celtic ''vs'' Q-Celtic division, but they may instead reflect a common [[substratum]] influence from the pre-Celtic languages of Britain and Ireland,[http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/288/5469/1158], or simply continuing contact between the insular languages; in either case they would be irrelevant to Celtic language classification in the genetic sense.\n\nQ-Celtic languages may also have {{IPA|/p/}} in loan words, though in early borrowings from Welsh into Primitive Irish {{IPA|/k\u02b7/}} was used by sound substitution due to a lack of a {{IPA|/p/}} phoneme at the time:\n*Latin ''Patricius'' \"[[Saint Patrick]]\"' > Welsh > Primitive Irish {{sm|Qatrikias}} > Old Irish ''Cothrige'', later [[Saint Patrick|''P\u00e1draig'']];\n*Latin ''[[presbyter]]'' \"priest\" > early form of word seen in [[Old Welsh]] ''premter primter'' > Primitive Irish {{sm|qrimitir}} > Old Irish ''cruimther''.\nGaelic ''p\u00f3g'' \"kiss\" was a later borrowing (from the second word of the Latin phrase ''osculum pacis'' \"kiss of peace\") at a stage where ''p'' was borrowed directly as ''p'', without substituting ''c''.\n\n===Vowels===\nThe Proto-Celtic vowel system is highly comparable to that reconstructed for [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] by [[Antoine Meillet]]. The following [[monophthong]]s have been reconstructed:\n:{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"width:40%\"\n! rowspan=\"2\" | Type\n! colspan=\"2\" | [[Front vowel|Front]]\n! colspan=\"2\" | [[Central vowel|Central]]\n! colspan=\"2\" | [[Back vowel|Back]]\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n! long\n! short\n! long\n! short\n! long\n! short\n|- style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!

Proto-Celtic is believed to have had nouns in three [[grammatical gender|genders]], three [[grammatical number|numbers]] and five to eight cases. The genders were the normal masculine, feminine and neuter, the three numbers were singular, plural and dual. The number of cases is a subject of contention:<ref>{{cite book |author=Pedersen, Holger |title=Vergleichende Grammatik der keltischen Sprachen, 2. Band, Bedeutungslehre (Wortlehre) |publisher=Vandenhoeck & Ruprecht |location=G\u00f6ttingen |year=1913 |isbn=978-3-525-26119-4 }}</ref> while Old Irish may have only five, the evidence from Continental Celtic is considered{{by whom|date=April 2011}} rather unambiguous despite appeals to archaic retentions or [[morphological leveling]]. These cases were [[nominative]], [[vocative]], [[accusative]], [[dative]], [[genitive]], [[ablative]], [[locative]] and [[instrumental case|instrumental]].\n\nNouns fall into nine or so declensions, depending on the stem. There are *''o''-stems, *''\u0101''-stems, *''i''-stems, *''u''-stems, dental stems, velar stems, nasal stems, *''r''-stems and *''s''-stems.\n\n====*''o''-stem nouns====\n*''makk\u02b7os'' 'son' (masculine) ([[Old Irish]] ''mac'' ~ [[Welsh language|Welsh]], [[Cornish language|Cornish]] and [[Breton language|Breton]] ''mab'')\n\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n!

Gaulish ''delgu'' \"I hold\", Old Irish ''tongu'' \"I swear\"\n* [[Imperative mood|imperative]] \u2014 seen in e.g. 3rd sg. Celtiberian ''usabituz'', Gaulish ''appisetu''\n* [[Subjunctive mood|subjunctive]] \u2014 seen in e.g. 3rd sg. Gaulish ''buetid'' \"may he be\", Celtiberian ''asekati''\nand four tenses:\n* [[Present tense|present]] \u2014 seen in e.g. Gaulish ''uedi\u00edu-mi'' \"I pray\", Celtiberian ''zizonti'' \"they sow\"\n* [[preterite]] \u2014 seen in e.g. 3rd sg. Gaulish ''sioxti'', Lepontic ''<small>K</small>ari<small>T</small>e''\n* [[imperfect]] \u2014 perhaps in Celtiberian ''kombalkez'', ''atibion''\n* [[Future tense|future]] \u2014 seen in e.g. 3rd sg.
