They emigrated to the United States via [[Liep\u0101ja|Libava]] (Liep\u0101ja, [[Latvia]]) and northern Germany. When they arrived, most settled in [[New York City|New York]], [[Philadelphia]], [[Boston]], and [[Baltimore]]. However, most of these first Belarusians were registered either as Russians (those who were Orthodox Christians) or as Poles (Roman Catholics). Most Belarusians who immigrated to the United States after [[World War I]] were political immigrants, mainly from western Europe and Poland. There were only several thousands of them. Very few Belarusians, mostly from Jewish-Belarusian families, came to the USA between the late 1930s and the end of 1941.<ref name=\"Belarusan Americans\"/>\n\nIn the post-World War II period, from 1948 to the early 1950s about 50,000 Belarusians immigrated to the United States; most of them left Europe for political reasons. These immigrants were former prisoners of war from the Polish and Soviet armies, persons who had worked in Germany as ''[[Ostarbeiters]]'' during the World War II, former \u00e9migr\u00e9s who left Belarus shortly after the war or in 1939 when the Soviets attacked Poland, refugees who had fled Belarus in 1943 or 1944, and defectors and dissidents after World War II. They came from many countries where they had settled after World War II. The majority of them came from West Germany and [[Austria]].

The [[USNS]] prefix identifies ''Comfort'' as a non-commissioned ship owned by the U.S. Navy and operationally crewed by civilians from the [[Military Sealift Command]] (MSC). A uniformed naval hospital staff and naval support staff is embarked when ''Comfort'' is deployed, said staffs consisting primarily of naval officers from the Navy's [[Medical Corps (United States Navy)|Medical Corps]], [[United States Navy Dental Corps|Dental Corps]], [[Navy Medical Service Corps|Medical Service Corps]], [[U.S. Navy Nurse Corps|Nurse Corps]], and [[Navy Chaplain Corps|Chaplain Corps]], and naval enlisted personnel from the [[Hospital Corpsman]] rating and various administrative and technical support ratings (e.g., [[Yeoman (United States Navy)|Yeoman]], [[Personnel Specialist (United States Navy)|Personnel Specialist]], [[Information Systems Technician (United States Navy)|Information Systems Technician]], [[Religious Program Specialist]], etc.).\n\nIn keeping with her status as a non-combatant vessel, naval personnel from the \"combat\" specialties are not assigned as regular crew or staff.

Operated by the [[Military Sealift Command]], ''Comfort'' provides rapid, flexible, and mobile medical and surgical services to support Marine Corps Air/Ground Task Forces deployed ashore, Army and Air Force units deployed ashore, and naval amphibious task forces and battle forces afloat. Secondarily, she provides mobile surgical hospital service for use by appropriate U.S. government agencies in disaster or humanitarian relief or limited humanitarian care incident to these missions or peacetime military operations.

More than 8,000 outpatients were seen, and 700 inpatients were admitted including four sailors injured in a high-pressure steam leak on {{USS|Iwo Jima|LPH-2|6}}. 337 surgical procedures were performed. Other notable benchmarks include: more than 2,100 safe helicopter activities; 7,000 prescriptions filled; 17,000 laboratory tests completed; 1,600 eyeglasses made; 800,000 meals served and 1,340 radiographic studies, including 141 [[CT scan]]s.\n{{-}}\n\n===Operation Sea Signal (1994)===\n{{Main|Operation Sea Signal}}\n''Comfort'' was ordered to activation to serve as migrant processing center for [[Haiti]]an migrants in 1994. During this mission, ''Comfort'' served as the first afloat migrant processing center. She set out for the Caribbean with a crew of 928 military and civilian personnel from various federal government and international agencies. On 16 June 1994 the first Haitian migrants were taken aboard. Over the months deployed, the population onboard swelled to 1,100. Shortly after, ''Comfort'' was ordered to discontinue processing and sailed for [[Guantanamo Bay Naval Base]], Cuba to drop off its remaining 400 migrants.\n{{-}}\n\n===Operation Uphold Democracy (1994)===\n{{Main|Operation Uphold Democracy}}\nOn 2 September 1994, ''Comfort'' was again directed to activate for an unprecedented second deployment.{{clarify|reason=no other hospital ship had been deployed twice?|date=April 2019}} ''Comfort'' was tasked to provide a 250-bed medically intensive patient capability for the 35,000 [[Cubans|Cuban]] and [[Haiti]]an migrants supported by Naval Station Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. ''Comfort'' departed Naval Base Norfolk, Virginia, with a specially configured crew of 566 personnel. Following the diplomatic agreement reached between the United States and [[Haiti]], ''Comfort'' took up a position off [[Port-au-Prince]] ready to receive casualties that might result from the transfer of U.S. and allied forces ashore. From 16 September through 2 October 1994, ''Comfort'' personnel provided both medical and surgical support to U.S. and allied forces ashore and afloat, emergency humanitarian care to injured Haitian citizens, and participated in various aspects of the Civil Affairs Program in an effort to aid the rebuilding effort of the local healthcare system.

''Comfort'' remained in the [[Persian Gulf]] for 56&nbsp;days providing expert medical care to wounded U.S. military personnel as well as injured [[Iraq]]i civilians and enemy prisoners of war. When ''Comfort'' returned to [[Baltimore]] on 12 June 2003, it marked the completion of a nearly six-month activation. During this time, the ship conducted more than 800 helicopter deck landings to bring aboard personnel, patients, and cargo. ''Comfort''{{'}}s Medical Treatment Facility had also performed 590 surgical procedures, transfused more than 600 units of blood, developed more than 8,000 radiographic images, and treated nearly 700 patients, including almost 200 Iraqi civilians and enemy prisoners of war.\n{{-}}\n[[File:FEMA - 16869 - Photograph by Win Henderson taken on 10-06-2005 in Louisiana.jpg|180px|left|thumb|''Comfort'' in [[New Orleans]] after Hurricane Katrina]]\n[[File:USNS Comfort (cropped).jpg|180px|right|thumb|''Comfort'' takes on supplies at [[Mayport, Florida]] en route to the [[Gulf Coast]] for victims of [[Hurricane Katrina]].]]\n\n===Hurricane Katrina (2005)===\n{{Main|Joint Task Force Katrina}}\n''Comfort'' deployed on 2 September 2005, after only a two-day preparation, to assist in Gulf Coast recovery efforts after the devastation of [[Hurricane Katrina]].

The missions objective was to offer valuable training to U.S. military personnel while promoting U.S. goodwill in the region. In all, the civilian and military medical team treated more than 98,000 patients, provided 386,000 patient encounters and performed 1,100 surgeries.\nThe embarked medical crew was made up of more than 500 military and [[non-governmental organization]] (Project Hope and Operation Smile) doctors, nurses, and healthcare professionals. Their primary focus was to support medical humanitarian assistance efforts ashore. A secondary mission was outpatient shipboard health service support.\nAlso supporting ''Comfort{{'}}s'' medical mission was a [[Seabee (US Navy)|SEABEE]] detachment from the East Coast-based Mobile Construction Battalion Maintenance Unit 202, which performed civic action repair and minor construction projects in the host countries. Also on the deployment was the U.S. Navy Showband from [[Norfolk, Virginia]], which performed in each port.\n''Comfort'' was operated and navigated by a crew of 68 civil service mariners (CIVMARS) from the U.S. Navy's Military Sealift Command (MSC).\nThis mission incorporated various non-government organizations and government agencies, such as Operation Smile, Project Hope, [[LDS Humanitarian Services]], the Atlanta Rotary Club, U.S. Air Force, U.S. Coast Guard, U.S. Army, U.S. Health and Human Services and the Canadian Armed Forces.\nPatient encounters included a single patient receiving multiple treatments, students in training sessions, and even veterinary care services.\nDentists and staff treated 25,000 patients, extracting 300 teeth, and performing 4,000 fillings, 7,000 sealings, and 20,000 fluoride applications.

''Comfort'' was positioned in proximity to [[Kuwait]], just off the coast of [[Saudi Arabia]] near [[Khafji]]. On 12 March 1991, ''Comfort'' was under way on her return trip home. She arrived in Baltimore on 15 April 1991. While deployed, ''Comfort'' traveled more than {{convert|30000|nmi|mi km|lk=in}} and consumed almost {{convert|3|e6U.S.gal|impgal L}} of fuel. More than 8,000 outpatients were seen, and 700 inpatients were admitted including four sailors injured in a high-pressure steam leak on {{USS|Iwo Jima|LPH-2|6}}. 337 surgical procedures were performed. Other notable benchmarks include: more than 2,100 safe helicopter activities; 7,000 prescriptions filled; 17,000 laboratory tests completed; 1,600 eyeglasses made; 800,000 meals served and 1,340 radiographic studies, including 141 [[CT scan]]s.\n{{-}}\n\n===Operation Sea Signal (1994)===\n{{Main|Operation Sea Signal}}\n''Comfort'' was ordered to activation to serve as migrant processing center for [[Haiti]]an migrants in 1994. During this mission, ''Comfort'' served as the first afloat migrant processing center. She set out for the Caribbean with a crew of 928 military and civilian personnel from various federal government and international agencies. On 16 June 1994 the first Haitian migrants were taken aboard. Over the months deployed, the population onboard swelled to 1,100. Shortly after, ''Comfort'' was ordered to discontinue processing and sailed for [[Guantanamo Bay Naval Base]], Cuba to drop off its remaining 400 migrants.\n{{-}}\n\n===Operation Uphold Democracy (1994)===\n{{Main|Operation Uphold Democracy}}\nOn 2 September 1994, ''Comfort'' was again directed to activate for an unprecedented second deployment.{{clarify|reason=no other hospital ship had been deployed twice?|date=April 2019}} ''Comfort'' was tasked to provide a 250-bed medically intensive patient capability for the 35,000 [[Cubans|Cuban]] and [[Haiti]]an migrants supported by Naval Station Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. ''Comfort'' departed Naval Base Norfolk, Virginia, with a specially configured crew of 566 personnel. Following the diplomatic agreement reached between the United States and [[Haiti]], ''Comfort'' took up a position off [[Port-au-Prince]] ready to receive casualties that might result from the transfer of U.S. and allied forces ashore. From 16 September through 2 October 1994, ''Comfort'' personnel provided both medical and surgical support to U.S. and allied forces ashore and afloat, emergency humanitarian care to injured Haitian citizens, and participated in various aspects of the Civil Affairs Program in an effort to aid the rebuilding effort of the local healthcare system. She returned to Norfolk on 14 October 1994.\n{{-}}\n[[Image:USNS Comfort Statue of Liberty.jpg|thumb|right|In 2001, ''Comfort'' passes the [[Statue of Liberty]] en route to Manhattan to provide assistance to victims of the [[September 11 attacks]] on the World Trade Center.]]\n\n===Operation Noble Eagle (2001)===\n{{Main|Operation Noble Eagle}}\n''Comfort'' was activated the afternoon of 11 September 2001, in response to the terrorist attack on the [[World Trade Center (1973\u20132001)|World Trade Center]] and sailed the next afternoon to serve as a 250-bed hospital facility at Pier 92 in midtown [[Manhattan]]. The ship arrived at Pier 92 in Manhattan at about 8:30&nbsp;p.m. 14 September. That evening a small number of relief workers arrived aboard the ship. As word about the ship spread, more workers began arriving over the next few days.

After stopping in [[Diego Garcia]] to embark additional medical personnel flown in from the National Naval Medical Center, the ship proceeded to the [[Persian Gulf]] to serve as an afloat trauma center in support of [[2003 invasion of Iraq|Operation Iraqi Freedom]]. ''Comfort'' remained in the [[Persian Gulf]] for 56&nbsp;days providing expert medical care to wounded U.S. military personnel as well as injured [[Iraq]]i civilians and enemy prisoners of war. When ''Comfort'' returned to [[Baltimore]] on 12 June 2003, it marked the completion of a nearly six-month activation. During this time, the ship conducted more than 800 helicopter deck landings to bring aboard personnel, patients, and cargo. ''Comfort''{{'}}s Medical Treatment Facility had also performed 590 surgical procedures, transfused more than 600 units of blood, developed more than 8,000 radiographic images, and treated nearly 700 patients, including almost 200 Iraqi civilians and enemy prisoners of war.\n{{-}}\n[[File:FEMA - 16869 - Photograph by Win Henderson taken on 10-06-2005 in Louisiana.jpg|180px|left|thumb|''Comfort'' in [[New Orleans]] after Hurricane Katrina]]\n[[File:USNS Comfort (cropped).jpg|180px|right|thumb|''Comfort'' takes on supplies at [[Mayport, Florida]] en route to the [[Gulf Coast]] for victims of [[Hurricane Katrina]].]]\n\n===Hurricane Katrina (2005)===\n{{Main|Joint Task Force Katrina}}\n''Comfort'' deployed on 2 September 2005, after only a two-day preparation, to assist in Gulf Coast recovery efforts after the devastation of [[Hurricane Katrina]].

Shortly afterwards, he set up the accountancy firm of Haughey, Boland & Company with Harry Boland, son of Fianna F\u00e1il Minister [[Gerald Boland]].\n\nOn 18 September 1951, he married [[Maureen Haughey|Maureen Lemass]], the daughter of the Fianna F\u00e1il Minister and future [[Taoiseach]] [[Se\u00e1n Lemass]], having been close to her since their days at UCD, where they first met.<ref name=\"IrTimes14June06\"/> They had four children together: Eimear, Conor, Ciar\u00e1n and [[Se\u00e1n Haughey|Se\u00e1n]].<ref name=IrTimes14June06/>\n\nAfter selling his house in [[Raheny]], in 1969, Haughey bought [[Abbeville, Dublin|Abbeville]], located at [[Kinsealy]], north [[County Dublin]], a historic house, once owned by [[Anglo-Irish]] politician [[John Beresford (statesman)|John Beresford]], for whom it had been extensively re-designed by the architect [[James Gandon]] in the late 18th century.

The constituency lines were redrawn under the [[Electoral (Amendment) Act 1974]], in an attempt to secure re-election for the sitting [[Fine Gael]]-[[Labour Party (Ireland)|Labour Party]] government in [[1977 Irish general election|the 1977 election]], when Haughey switched to representing [[Dublin Artane (D\u00e1il constituency)|Dublin Artane]]; but this constituency was abolished in 1981 and most of Haughey's electoral area was moved into the reformed [[Dublin North-Central (D\u00e1il constituency)|Dublin North-Central]] constituency, which he represented from 1981 until his retirement in 1992.\n\nHaughey obtained his first government position, that of Parliamentary Secretary to the [[Minister for Justice (Ireland)|Minister for Justice]], to his constituency colleague [[Oscar Traynor]] in 1960. It is unclear whether the choice was made by Lemass directly as [[Taoiseach]], or by the cabinet against his wishes.<ref>Lemass was Haughey's father-in-law as well as Taoiseach.</ref> Lemass had advised Haughey;\n<blockquote>''As Taoiseach it is my duty to offer you the post of parliamentary secretary, and as your father-in-law I am advising you not to take it.''<ref>T. Ryle Dwyer, ''Short Fellow: A Biography of Charles J. Haughey'' (Marino, 1995) p.31.</ref></blockquote>\nHaughey ignored Lemass's advice and accepted the offer. Although officially junior to Traynor, Haughey was the ''de facto'' Minister.<ref>Traynor, a Minister from \u00c9amon de Valera's era, was elderly and in poor health, and only nominally running the department.</ref> Haughey and Traynor clashed openly.\n\nHaughey came to epitomise the new style of politician \u2013 the \"men in the mohair suits\". He regularly socialised with other younger cabinet colleagues, such as [[Donogh O'Malley]] and [[Brian Lenihan Snr|Brian Lenihan]].<ref name=it-3/>\n<blockquote>''By day he impressed the D\u00e1il. By night he basked in the admiration of a fashionable audience in the Russell Hotel. There, or in Dublin's more expensive restaurants, the company included artists, musicians and entertainers, professionals, builders and business people.''\n''His companions, Lenihan and O'Malley, took mischievous delight in entertaining the Russell with tales of the Old Guard. O'Malley in turn entertained the company in Limerick's Brazen Head or Cruise's Hotel with accounts of the crowd in the Russell. On the wings of such tales Haughey's reputation spread.''</blockquote>\n\nHaughey's status by 1961 was such that Leader of the Opposition [[James Dillon (Fine Gael politician)|James Dillon]] complimented him lavishly on the floor of the D\u00e1il, remarking on his opponent's \"skill with which he has had recourse to his brief,\" as well as his \"extraordinary erudition\" and \"his exceptional and outstanding ability.\"<ref>T. Ryle Dwyer, ''Haughey's Forty Years of Controversy'' (2003), p.33.</ref>\n\n== Ministerial office ==\n\n===Minister for Justice===\nWhen Traynor retired in 1961, Haughey succeeded him as [[Minister for Justice and Equality|Minister for Justice]]. As such, he initiated an extensive scale of legislative reforms. He introduced new legislation including the Adoption Act; the Succession Act, which protected the inheritance rights of wives and children;<ref name=it-8>[http://www.irishtimes.com/focus/haughey/ITstories/story8.htm  'Irish solutions for Irish problems'] \u2013 ''The Irish Times'' obituary.</ref> the Criminal Justice Act, which severely restricted the application of capital punishment; and the Extradition Act, which virtually prevented extradition for IRA offences. Haughey also introduced the Special Military Courts which helped to defeat the [[Irish Republican Army (1922\u20131969)|Irish Republican Army]]'s [[Border Campaign (Irish Republican Army)|Border Campaign]].<ref name=it-3/>\n\n===Minister for Agriculture: 1966 Farmers' Strike===\nIn 1964, Lemass appointed Haughey as [[Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine|Minister for Agriculture]].<ref>The previous Minister for Agriculture, [[Patrick Smith (politician)|Paddy Smith]], had resigned over a policy dispute.</ref> Criticism was voiced from the [[Irish Farmers' Association|National Farmers Association]] (NFA) of the appointment of a non-rural person to the position, and there was increased antagonism from farmers towards the government. Haughey became embroiled in a series of controversies with the NFA and with another organisation, the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association (ICMSA).<ref name=it-3/> Twenty-seven ICMSA picketers outside [[Leinster House]], were arrested on 27 April 1966 under the ''[[Offences Against the State Act]]'', an act originally intended for use against the IRA. 78 were arrested the following day, and 80 a day later as the dispute escalated. The general public was supportive of the farmers, who were not in a position to hold a strike to air their grievances, and who were clearly only posing a problem to the Minister, rather than the state. The farmers then began a national solidarity campaign, and even farmers who supported Fianna F\u00e1il turned against the government. Haughey, who did not rely on rural voters, was under intense pressure from fearful members of his own party to negotiate a deal and reduce the tension. It was Haughey's first alienation of a significant voting block, and probably damaged him electorally in later years as many farmers remembered the events, known in folk memory as the \"Farmers' Strike\".\n\n===Minister for Finance and 1966 presidential election===\nHaughey was appointed by Fianna F\u00e1il to run President [[\u00c9amon de Valera]]'s re-election campaign for the [[1966 Irish presidential election|1966 presidential election]]. His interventions proved highly controversial. [[Fine Gael]] chose a comparatively young [[Teachta D\u00e1la|TD]] and [[barrister]], [[Tom O'Higgins]] (nephew of [[Kevin O'Higgins]]), to run against de Valera. Aware that de Valera's age (84) and almost total blindness might compare unfavourably to O'Higgins, whose campaign drew comparisons with the equally youthful [[US President]] [[John F. Kennedy]], Haughey launched what was seen as a political stroke. He insisted that it was beneath the presidency to actively campaign, meaning that de Valera would have a low profile. Therefore, in the interests of fairness the media was asked to give O'Higgins an equally low profile, ignoring his speeches and publicity campaign. The print media, both nationally and locally, ignored Haughey's suggestion. But the state-run [[Raidi\u00f3 Teilif\u00eds \u00c9ireann]], facing criticism from Lemass' government for being too radical in other areas, agreed and largely ignored the O'Higgins campaign.\n\nDe Valera got a high media profile from a different source, the fiftieth anniversary commemoration of the [[Easter Rising]], of which he was the most senior survivor. While O'Higgins's campaign was ignored by RT\u00c9, de Valera appeared in RT\u00c9 coverage of the Rising events regularly. To add further to de Valera's campaign, Haughey as Agriculture Minister arranged<ref name=dib>{{cite web|url=http://www.ria.ie/research/dib/new-entries/haughey--charles-james-(c-j-).aspx |title=Dictionary of Irish Biography \u2013 Haughey, Charles James (C.J.) |last1=Maume |first1=Patrick |website=[[Royal Irish Academy]] |accessdate=24 October 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029184744/http://www.ria.ie/research/dib/new-entries/haughey--charles-james-%28c-j-%29.aspx |archivedate=29 October 2013 }}</ref> for milk price increases to be given to farmers on the eve of polling, as a way of reducing farmer disquiet after they had effectively become an opposition movement to the government.\n\nThese tactics should have ensured an easy de Valera victory. Instead O'Higgins came within less than one percent of winning the vote. The President was re-elected by a narrow margin of ten thousand votes out of a total of nearly one million. De Valera came to distrust Haughey. De Valera's Minister for Foreign Affairs and lifelong political confidant [[Frank Aiken]] dismissed Haughey's political motives as being entirely selfish, and believed he was motivated to hold power for its own sake and not duty.\n\nIn 1966, the [[Taoiseach]] [[Se\u00e1n Lemass]] retired. Haughey declared his candidature to succeed Lemass in the consequent [[1966 Fianna F\u00e1il leadership election|leadership election]], and [[George Colley]] and [[Neil Blaney]] did likewise. As this meant that there were three strong candidates who held strong and divisive views on the future of the party, the party elders sought to find a compromise candidate. Lemass himself encouraged his [[Minister for Finance]] [[Jack Lynch]], to contest the party leadership, and encouraged Colley, Haughey and Blaney to withdraw in favour of Lynch, arguing that they would not win a contest against him. However, Colley refused the Taoiseach's request and insisted on remaining in the race, but he was defeated by Lynch. Upon Lynch's election as Taoiseach, Haughey was appointed Minister for Finance by Lynch, in a cabinet reshuffle, which indicated that Haughey's withdrawal was a gain at the expense of Colley. The inexpensive and socially inclusive initiatives that Haughey made caught the public imagination; these included popular decisions to introduce free travel on public transport for pensioners, subsidise electricity for pensioners, the granting of special tax concessions for the disabled and tax exemptions for artists. They increased Haughey's populist appeal and his support from certain elements in the media and artistic community.\n\nAs Minister for Finance, Haughey on two occasions arranged foreign currency loans for the government which he then arranged to be left on deposit in foreign countries ([[Germany]] and the [[United States]]), in the local currencies, instead of immediately changing the loans to [[Irish punt]]s and depositing them in the exchequer. These actions were unconstitutional, because it effectively meant that the Minister for Finance was making a currency speculation against his own currency. When this was challenged by the Comptroller and Auditor General [[Eugene Francis Suttle]], Haughey introduced a law to retrospectively legalise his actions. The debate was very short and the record shows no understanding of the issue by the Opposition Spokesperson for Finance, O'Higgins for Fine Gael and Tully for Labour. The legislation was passed on 26 November 1969.\n\n===Arms crisis===\n{{More citations needed section|date=March 2007}}\n{{Main|Arms Crisis}}\nThe late 1960s saw the old tensions boil over into an eruption of violence in [[Northern Ireland]]. Haughey was generally seen as coming from the pragmatist wing of the party, and was not believed to have strong opinions on the matter, despite having family links with [[Derry]]. Indeed, many presumed that he had a strong [[antipathy]] to [[physical force Irish republicanism]]; during his period as Minister for Justice he had followed a tough anti-IRA line, including using [[internment]] without trial against the IRA. The ''hawks'' in the cabinet were seen as [[Kevin Boland]] and [[Neil Blaney]], both sons of founding fathers in the party with strong [[Irish Republican Army|Old IRA]] pasts. Blaney was also a TD for [[Donegal (town)|Donegal]]; a staunchly [[Irish Republicanism|Republican]] area which bordered [[Derry]]. They were opposed by those described as the \"doves\" of the cabinet; [[T\u00e1naiste]] [[Erskine Hamilton Childers|Erskine Childers]], [[George Colley]] and [[Patrick Hillery]]. A fund of \u00a3100,000 was set up to give to the Nationalist people in the form of aid. Haughey, as Finance Minister would have a central role in the management of this fund.\n\nThere was general surprise when, in an incident known as the ''[[Arms Crisis]]'', Haughey, along with Blaney, was sacked from Lynch's cabinet amid allegations of the use of the funds to import arms for use by the [[Irish Republican Army (1922\u20131969)|IRA]]. The Garda [[Special Detective Unit|Special Branch]] informed the Minister for Justice [[M\u00edche\u00e1l \u00d3 M\u00f3r\u00e1in]] and Taoiseach Jack Lynch that a plot to import arms existed and included government members, however Lynch took no action until the Special Branch made Leader of the Opposition [[Liam Cosgrave]] aware of the plot. Cosgrave told Lynch he knew of the plot and would announce it in the D\u00e1il the next day if he didn't act. Lynch subsequently requested Haughey and Blaney to resign from cabinet. Both men refused, saying they did nothing illegal. Lynch then asked President de Valera to terminate their appointments as members of the government, a request that de Valera was required to grant by convention. Boland resigned in sympathy, while M\u00edche\u00e1l \u00d3 M\u00f3r\u00e1in was dismissed one day earlier in a preemptive strike to ensure a subservient Minister for Justice was in place when the crisis broke. Lynch chose government chief whip Desmond O'Malley for the role. Haughey and Blaney were subsequently tried in court along with an army Officer, Captain [[James Kelly (Irish Army officer)|James Kelly]], and [[Albert Luykx]], a former Flemish [[National Socialist]] and businessman, who allegedly used his contacts to buy the arms.<ref name=dib /><ref>{{cite book |last1=Dillon |first1=Martin |author-link1=Martin Dillon|year=2012|title=The Dirty War |url=https://books.google.com/?id=er3HfXL7CKQC&pg=PA20&lpg=PA20&dq=charles+haughey+neil+blaney+james+kelly+albert+luykx+trial#v=onepage&q=charles%20haughey%20neil%20blaney%20james%20kelly%20albert%20luykx%20trial&f=false |publisher=[[Random House]]|page=20|isbn=9781407074801 |accessdate=24 October 2013}}</ref> After trial all the accused were acquitted but many refused to recognise the verdict of the courts. Although cleared of wrongdoing, it looked as if Haughey's political career was finished. Blaney and Boland eventually resigned from Fianna F\u00e1il but Haughey remained. He spent his years on the backbenches \u2013 the wilderness years \u2013 building support within the grassroots of the party; during this time, he remained loyal to the party and served the leader, but after the debacle of the \"arms crises\" neither man trusted the other.\n\n==Leadership years==\n{{More citations needed section|date=February 2007}}\n\n=== Opposition to Jack Lynch ===\nIn 1975, Fianna F\u00e1il was in opposition and Haughey had achieved enough grassroots support to warrant a recall to [[Jack Lynch]]'s opposition front bench. Haughey was appointed Spokesman on Health and Social Welfare, a fairly minor portfolio at the time, but Haughey used the same imagination and skill he displayed in other positions to formulate innovative and far reaching policies. Two years later in 1977, Fianna F\u00e1il returned to power with a massive parliamentary majority in [[D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann]], having had a very populist campaign (spearhead by Colley and O'Malley) to abolish rates, vehicle tax and other extraordinary concessions, which were short-lived. Haughey returned to the [[Irish Government|cabinet]], after an absence of seven years as [[Minister for Health (Ireland)|Minister for Health]] and [[Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection|Social Welfare]].\n\nIn this position he continued the progressive policies he had shown earlier by, among others, beginning the first government anti-smoking campaigns and legalising contraception, previously banned. Following the finding by the [[Supreme Court of Ireland]], in McGee v The Attorney General, that there was a constitutional right to use contraceptives, he introduced The Family Planning Bill which proved to be highly controversial. The bill allowed a pharmacist to sell contraceptives on presentation of a medical prescription. Haughey called this bill \"[[an Irish solution to an Irish problem]]\". It is often stated that the recipient of the prescription had to be married, but the legislation did not include this requirement.\n\nIt was also during this period that Lynch began to lose his grip on the party, the economy faltered in the aftermath of energy crises{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} and the fallout from the giveaway concessions that had re-elected the government under Lynch, led to a succession race to succeed Lynch. As well as this a group of backbenchers began to lobby in support of Haughey. This group, known as the \"gang of five,\" consisted of [[Jackie Fahey]], [[Tom McEllistrim (1926\u20132000)|Tom McEllistrim]], [[Se\u00e1n Doherty (Roscommon politician)|Se\u00e1n Doherty]], [[Mark Killilea Jnr]] and [[Albert Reynolds]]. Haughey was also helped by the [[Teachta D\u00e1la|TD]] [[S\u00edle de Valera]]. The granddaughter of [[\u00c9amon de Valera]], she was highly critical of [[Jack Lynch]]'s policy regards to Northern Ireland. In a speech at the Liam Lynch commemoration at [[Fermoy]] on 9 September, de Valera made a series of thinly veiled attacks on Lynch.<ref name=\"autogenerated182\">Down Down Deeper and Down \u2013 Ireland in the 70's and 80's \u2013 Eamon Sweeney \u2013 pg 182</ref> Although Lynch quickly tried to impose party discipline, attempting to discipline her for opposing party policy at a parliamentary party meeting held at the 28th, de Valera correctly pointed out that she had not opposed the party policy regarding Northern Ireland which called for the declaration of the British intent to withdraw from Northern Ireland.<ref name=\"autogenerated182\"/> Lynch left for a trip to the United States on 7 November. On the same day the government lost two by-elections to [[Fine Gael]] in [[Cork (city)|Cork]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://electionsireland.org/result.cfm?election=1977B&cons=51%20&ref=101|title=21st Dail By Elections \u2013 Cork City First Preference Votes|publisher=ElectionsIreland.org|accessdate=28 December 2010}}</ref> and in [[Cork North-East (D\u00e1il constituency)|Cork North-East]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://electionsireland.org/result.cfm?election=1977B&cons=58&ref=102|title=21st Dail By Elections \u2013 Cork North-East First Preference Votes|publisher=ElectionsIreland.org|accessdate=28 December 2010}}</ref> During the trip Lynch claimed in an interview with the [[Washington Post]] that a five-kilometer air corridor between the border was agreed upon during the meeting with [[British Prime Minister]] [[Margaret Thatcher]], to enhance security co-operation.<ref>Ireland in the 20th Century \u2013 Tim Pat Coogan</ref><ref>Down Down Deeper and Down \u2013 Ireland in the 70's and 80's \u2013 Eamon Sweeney \u2013 pg 186</ref> This was something highly unsavoury to many in [[Fianna F\u00e1il]]. When Lynch returned he was questioned on this by a [[County Clare|Clare]] backbencher [[Bill Loughnane]], along with [[Tom McEllistrim (1926\u20132000)|Tom McEllistrim]] at a parliamentary party meeting.<ref>Down Down Deeper and Down \u2013 Ireland in the 70's and 80's \u2013 Eamon Sweeney \u2013 pg 186 -187</ref> Lynch stated that the British did not have permission to overfly the border. Afterwards Loughnane went public with the details of the meeting and accused Lynch of deliberately misleading the party. An attempt to remove the whip from Loughnane failed. At this stage Lynch's position had become untenable, with supporters of Haughey and George Colley caucusing opinion within the party.\n\nIn December 1979, Lynch announced his resignation as [[Taoiseach]] and leader of [[Fianna F\u00e1il]]. The [[1979 Fianna F\u00e1il leadership election|leadership contest]] that resulted was a two-horse race between Haughey and the [[T\u00e1naiste]], [[George Colley]]. Colley had the support of the entire cabinet, with the exception of [[Michael O'Kennedy]], and felt that this popularity would be reflected within the parliamentary party as a whole.\n\nHaughey on the other hand was distrusted by a number of his Cabinet colleagues, but was much more respected by new backbenchers who were worried about the safety of their D\u00e1il seats. When the vote was taken Haughey emerged as the victor by a margin of 44 votes to 38, a very clear division within the party. In a conciliatory gesture, Colley was re-appointed as [[T\u00e1naiste]] and had a veto over whom Haughey would appoint as Ministers for Justice and for Defence. This was due to his distrust of Haughey on security issues (because of the Arms Crisis). However, he was removed from the important position of Minister for Finance.\n\nNonetheless, on 11 December 1979, Charles Haughey was elected [[Taoiseach]] and leader of [[Fianna F\u00e1il]], almost a decade after the Arms Crisis nearly destroyed his political career. In 2010, a founder of the [[Saatchi & Saatchi]] advertising firm, said that Haughey had asked for 'a new image' similar to the one provided for [[Margaret Thatcher]] for the [[1979 United Kingdom general election|1979 general election]].<ref>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/ireland/article7017966.ece Haughey \u2018wanted a new image\u2019] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604184540/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/ireland/article7017966.ece |date=4 June 2011 }}</ref>\n\n===7th Taoiseach (1979\u20131981)===\nWhen Haughey came to power, the country was sinking into a deep economic crisis, following the [[1979 energy crisis]]. Haughey effectively acted as his own Minister for Finance, ignoring the views of his Minister. One of his first functions as Taoiseach was a televised address to the nation \u2013 only the third such address in the Republic's history \u2013 in which he outlined the bleak economic picture:<ref>[https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/haughey-1-14m-in-debt-went-on-tv-to-lecture-the-nation-on-overspending-1.1258709 Haughey, \u00a31.14m in debt, went on TV to lecture the nation on overspending],\n''[[Irish Times]]'', January 30, 1999</ref>\n\n{{cquote|I wish to talk to you this evening about the state of the nation's affairs and the picture I have to paint is not, unfortunately, a very cheerful one. The figures which are just now becoming available to us show one thing very clearly. '''As a community we are living away beyond our means'''. I don't mean that everyone in the community is living too well, clearly many are not and have barely enough to get by, but taking us all together we have been living at a rate which is simply not justified by the amount of goods and services we are producing. To make up the difference we have been borrowing enormous amounts of money, borrowing at a rate which just cannot continue. A few simple figures will make this very clear...we will just have to reorganise government spending so that we can only undertake those things we can afford... |14px|14px|Charles Haughey, 9 January 1980}}\n\nWhile Haughey had identified the problem with the economy, his actions made the problem worse. He increased public spending, which soon became out of control, and led to increases in borrowing and taxation at an unacceptable level. By 1981, Haughey was still reasonably popular and decided to call a general election. However, the timing of the election was thwarted twice by external events, in particular the [[hunger strike]]s of [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|IRA]] volunteers for political status. The [[Anti H-Block|Anti H-Block Committee]] announced that they would field abstentionist candidates which many predicted correctly would take Republican votes away from [[Fianna F\u00e1il]]. This coincided with the [[Stardust Disaster]], where a fire destroyed a night club in Haughey's constituency and claimed the lives of 48 young people; these caused Haughey to delay the Ard Fheis and the election. The [[1981 Irish general election|poll was eventually held in June]], much later than Haughey wanted. In the hope of winning an overall D\u00e1il majority Haughey's campaign took a populist line with regard to taxation, spending and Northern Ireland. The campaign was enhanced and hyped up by a live debate on [[Raidi\u00f3 Teilif\u00eds \u00c9ireann|RT\u00c9]] between Haughey and the Leader of the Opposition [[Garret FitzGerald]], of Fine Gael, over the major issues. On the day of the vote Fianna F\u00e1il won 45.5%, failing to secure a majority in the 166-seat D\u00e1il. A [[Fine Gael]]\u2013[[Labour Party (Ireland)|Labour Party]] coalition came to power, under FitzGerald and Haughey went into opposition.\n\nWithin days of his becoming Taoiseach, [[Allied Irish Banks]] forgave Haughey \u00a3400,000 of a \u00a31,000,000 debt. No reason was given for this. [[The Economist]] obituary on Haughey (24 June 2006) asserted that he had warned the bank \"I can be a very troublesome adversary\".\n\n===Opposition (1981\u20131982)===\nFitzGerald's government lasted until January 1982, when it collapsed due to a controversial budget which proposed the application of Value Added Tax to children's shoes, previously exempt. FitzGerald, no longer having a majority in the D\u00e1il, went to [[\u00c1ras an Uachtar\u00e1in]], to advise [[President of Ireland|President]] [[Patrick Hillery|Hillery]] to dissolve the D\u00e1il and call a general election. However, the night the government collapsed the Fianna F\u00e1il Front Bench issued a statement encouraging the President not to grant the dissolution and to allow Fianna F\u00e1il to form a government. Phone calls were also made to the President by [[Brian Lenihan Snr|Brian Lenihan]].<ref>This attempted contact with the President proved a major embarrassment to Lenihan subsequently in 1990.</ref> Haughey, on attempting to contact his former colleague, the President, and on failing to be put through to him, was reported to have threatened the President's [[aide de camp]] by telling him that he would be Taoiseach one day and when that happened, ''I intend to roast your fucking arse if you don't put me through immediately''.<ref>Finlay, Fergus ''Snakes and Ladders'' pub:New Island Books 1998. Haughey told the D\u00e1il that he never insulted an army officer and he never would. Lenihan in his subsequent account noted that no-one ever claimed Haughey had insulted an army officer but that he had threatened him, a subtle but important difference, and that Haughey never denied threatening the army officer, merely denied ever insulting an army officer.</ref> Hillery considered such pressure to be gross misconduct, and granted the dissolution.\n\nA biography of [[Patrick Hillery|Hillery]] blames Haughey for the sex scandal rumours which almost destroyed the presidency of Hillery in 1979.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/haughey-blamed-for-sex-smear-against-hillery-1573729.html|title=Haughey blamed for sex smear against Hillery|newspaper=[[Irish Independent]]|date=13 December 2008|accessdate=2 December 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Second term as Taoiseach (1982)===\nAfter the [[February 1982 Irish general election|February 1982 election]], when Haughey failed to win an overall majority again, questions were raised about his leadership. Some of Haughey's critics in the party suggested that an alternative candidate should stand as the party's nominee for [[Taoiseach]]. [[Desmond O'Malley]] emerged as the likely alternative candidate and was ready to challenge Haughey for the leadership. However, on the day of the vote O'Malley withdrew and Haughey went forward as the nominee. He engineered [[confidence and supply]] agreements with the Independent Socialist TD, [[Tony Gregory]] (in return for \u00a3100 million of investment in the Dublin North Inner City; a deal dubbed the Gregory Deal), the [[Independent Fianna F\u00e1il]] TD [[Neil Blaney]] and three [[Workers' Party of Ireland|Workers' Party]] TDs, which saw him return as Taoiseach for a second time.\n\nHaughey's second term was dominated by even more economic mismanagement, based on Haughey's policy of using government policy and money, in an effort to induce a sufficiently large share of the electorate to vote him his elusive 'overall majority' in the D\u00e1il. With Haughey and his supporters taking a dangerously populist line in every area of policy, and refusing to address serious shortcomings in the performance of the state, a growing minority in his own party were becoming increasingly concerned. The issue of his leadership cropped up again when in October the backbench TD, [[Charlie McCreevy]], put down a motion of no-confidence in Haughey. Desmond O'Malley disagreed with the timing but supported the hasty motion of no confidence all the same. O'Malley resigned from the cabinet prior to the vote as he was going to vote against Haughey. A campaign now started that was extremely vicious on the side of Haughey's supporters, with threats made to the careers of those who dissented from the leadership. After a marathon 15-hour party meeting, Haughey, who insisted on a roll-call as opposed to a secret ballot, and won the open ballot by 58 votes to 22. Not long after this, Haughey's government collapsed when the Workers' Party TD's and [[Tony Gregory]] withdrew their support for the government over a Fianna F\u00e1il policy document called \"The Way Forward,\" which would lead to massive spending cuts. Fianna F\u00e1il lost the [[November 1982 Irish general election|November 1982 election]] and FitzGerald once again returned as Taoiseach at the head of a Fine Gael-Labour coalition with a comfortable D\u00e1il majority. Haughey found himself back in opposition.\n\nDuring this tenure of Haughey, the [[GUBU|''GUBU'' Incidents]], involving the [[Attorney General of Ireland|Attorney General]] to his Government, occurred in Dublin. At a press-conference on the affair, Haughey was paraphrased as having described the affair as ''\"grotesque, unbelievable, bizarre and unprecedented\"'', from which journalist and former politician [[Conor Cruise O'Brien]] coined the term [[GUBU]].\n\n===Return to opposition (1982\u20131987)===\nHaughey's leadership came under scrutiny for a third time when a report linked Haughey with the [[Irish phone tapping scandal (1983)|phone tapping of political journalists]]. In spite of huge pressure Haughey refused to resign and survived yet another vote of no-confidence in early 1983, albeit with a smaller majority. Haughey's success was partly due to the death of the Fianna F\u00e1il TD [[Clement Coughlan]], a supporter of O'Malley. Haughey's supporters managed to have the meeting moved to the following week after the funeral, which gave him more time to manoeuver. Having failed three times to oust Haughey, most of his critics gave up and returned to normal politics.\n\nIn May 1984, the New-Ireland Forum Report was published. Haughey was involved in the drafting of this at the time he was in office and had agreed to potential scenarios for improving the political situation of Northern Ireland. However, on publication, Haughey rejected it and said the only possible solution was a United Ireland. This statement was criticised by the other leaders who forged the New-Ireland Forum, [[John Hume]], Garret FitzGerald and [[Dick Spring]]. Desmond O'Malley supported the Forum report and criticised Haughey's ambiguous position, accusing him of stifling debate. At a Fianna F\u00e1il Parliamentary Party meeting to discuss the report, the whip was removed from O'Malley, which meant he was no longer a Fianna F\u00e1il TD. Ironically, when Haughey returned to power he embraced the [[Anglo-Irish Agreement]] that had developed from the New Ireland Forum Report.\n\nIn early 1985, a bill was introduced by the Fine Gael-Labour government to liberalise the sale of contraceptives in the country. [[Fianna F\u00e1il]] in opposition opposed the bill. O'Malley supported it as a matter of principle rather than a political point to oppose for opposition's sake. On the day of the vote O'Malley spoke in the D\u00e1il chamber stated:\n\n<blockquote>\n ''But I do not believe that the interests of this State or our Constitution and of this Republic would be served by putting politics before conscience in regard to this .... I stand by the Republic and accordingly, I will not oppose this Bill.''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://historical-debates.oireachtas.ie/D/0356/D.0356.198502200003.html |title=D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann \u2013 Volume 356 |publisher=Oireachtas historical |date=20 February 1985 |accessdate=2 December 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607111737/http://historical-debates.oireachtas.ie/D/0356/D.0356.198502200003.html |archivedate= 7 June 2011 }}</ref></blockquote>\n\nHe abstained rather than vote with the government. Despite this Haughey moved against O'Malley and in February 1985, O'Malley was charged with \"conduct un-becoming\". At a Party meeting, even though O'Malley did not have the Party whip, he was expelled from the Fianna F\u00e1il organisation by 73 votes to 9 in roll-call vote. With [[George Colley]] dead, O'Malley expelled and other critics silenced, Haughey was finally in full control of Fianna F\u00e1il.\n\nO'Malley decided to form a new political party and 21 December 1985, Desmond O'Malley announced the formation of the [[Progressive Democrats]]. Several Fianna F\u00e1il TDs joined including [[Mary Harney]] and [[Bobby Molloy]].\n\nIn November 1985, the [[Anglo-Irish Agreement]] was signed between Garret FitzGerald and British Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]]. The agreement gave [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] a formal say in [[Northern Ireland]] and its affairs. As was the case with the New Ireland Forum Report, the Anglo-Irish Agreement was harshly criticised by Haughey, who said that he would re-negotiate it, if re-elected. FitzGerald called a general election for February 1987. The campaign was dominated by attacks on the government over severe cuts in the budget and the general mismanagement of the economy. When the results were counted Haughey had failed once again to win an overall majority for Fianna F\u00e1il. When it came to electing a Taoiseach in the D\u00e1il Haughey's position looked particularly volatile. When it came to a vote the Independent TD [[Tony Gregory]] voted against Fitzgerald but abstained on Haughey, seeing Haughey as the \"lesser of two evils\" (the reason for this was Gregory's opposition to the Anglo-Irish agreement as well as his personal dislike of Garrett Fitzgerald and Fine Gael). Haughey was elected Taoiseach on the casting vote of the [[Ceann Comhairle]].\n\n===Final term as Taoiseach (1987\u20131992)===\n{{More citations needed section|date=December 2006}}\nHaughey now headed a minority [[Fianna F\u00e1il]] government. [[Fine Gael]] under leader [[Alan Dukes]], made the unprecedented move, with its [[Tallaght strategy]], of supporting the government and voting for it when it came to introducing tough economic policies. The national debt had doubled under previous administrations, so the government introduced severe budget cuts in all departments. The taxation system was transformed to encourage enterprise and employment. One of the major schemes put forward, and one which would have enormous economic benefits for the country, was the establishment of the [[International Financial Services Centre]] (IFSC) in [[Dublin]].\n[[File:Rueda de prensa de Felipe Gonz\u00e1lez y el primer ministro de Irlanda.

The government lost the vote, which was seen as merely embarrassing, but Haughey, buoyed by opinion polls which indicated the possibility of winning an overall majority, called a general election for 15 June. [[Fianna F\u00e1il]] however ended up losing four seats and the possibility of forming another minority government looked slim. For the first time in history a nominee for [[Taoiseach]] failed to achieve a majority when a vote was taken in the D\u00e1il, on 29 June 1989.<ref name=IrishTimes27Feb2016a>{{cite news |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/1989-a-road-map-for-fine-gael-fianna-f%C3%A1il-deal-1.2550069|title=1989 a road map for Fine Gael-Fianna F\u00e1il deal|newspaper=The Irish Times|author=Stephen O'Byrnes| date=27 February 2016|accessdate=21 March 2017}}</ref> Constitutionally Haughey was obliged to resign, however he refused to, for a short period.

It was the first time that Fianna F\u00e1il had entered into a coalition, abandoning one of its \"core values\" in the overwhelming need to form a government.<ref name=rte-obituary/>\n\nHaughey in 1990 had more difficulties than successes. The first half of the year saw Haughey in a leading role as European statesman, when Ireland held the presidency of the [[European Community]], which rotated semi-annually between the member states of the [[European Union]]. Haughey supported [[German Reunification]] and during the extraordinary [[List of European Council meetings|Dublin Summit]], which he called for in April, he pressed this viewpoint forward.<ref>[http://aei.pitt.edu/1397/1/Dublin_april_1990.pdf The European Council, Dublin, 28 April 1990]</ref><ref>[http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_DOC-90-1_en.htm?locale=en European Commission, Press Release Database]</ref><ref>[http://www.irishtimes.com/news/germany-will-never-forget-ireland-s-help-1.658399 Germany Will Never Forget Ireland\u00b4s Help, ''Irish Times'']</ref><ref>European Commission, Ireland\u00b4s Previous Presidencies, {{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/ireland/how_the_eu_works/presidency/index_en.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-07-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150711144901/http://ec.europa.eu/ireland/how_the_eu_works/presidency/index_en.htm |archivedate=11 July 2015 |df=dmy }}</ref> He believed both [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] and [[Germany]] were similar in that both countries were divided. During a [[D\u00e1il]] debate on [[German Reunification]], Haughey stated \"I have expressed a personal view that coming as we do from a country which is also divided many of us would have sympathy with any wish of the people of the two German States for unification\".<ref>[http://debates.oireachtas.ie/dail/1989/12/13/00007.asp German Reunification, Houses of the Oireachtas, D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann]</ref>\n\nThe [[1990 Irish presidential election|Presidential election]] was disappointing for Haughey with Brian Lenihan, the [[T\u00e1naiste]], who was nominated as the party's candidate, being defeated by [[Mary Robinson]]. During the campaign the controversy over the phone calls made to the [[\u00c1ras an Uachtar\u00e1in]] in 1982, urging the then President not to dissolve the D\u00e1il resurfaced. Lenihan was accused of calling and attempting to influence the President, who as [[Head of State]] is above politics. The Progressive Democrats threatened to pull out of the coalition and support a Fine Gael no-confidence motion unless Haughey forced Lenihan out. Haughey tried to force Lenihan to resign, and sacked him when he refused to do so. Lenihan's dismissal damaged Haughey's standing in the Fianna F\u00e1il organisation.\n\nHaughey's grip on political power began to slip in the autumn of 1991. There was a series of resignations by chairmen of semi-state companies, followed by an open declaration by [[Minister for Finance (Ireland)|Minister for Finance]] [[Albert Reynolds]], that he had every intention of standing for the party leadership if Haughey resigned. Following a heated parliamentary party meeting, [[Se\u00e1n Power (politician)|Se\u00e1n Power]], one of Reynolds's supporters, put down a motion of no-confidence in Haughey. Reynolds and his supporters were sacked from the government by Haughey, who went on to win the no-confidence motion by 55 votes to 22.\n\n[[File:Plaque at former Hells Kitchen pub Castlerea (2018).jpg|thumb|Plaque at the [[Hells Kitchen Railway Museum]], [[Castlerea]].]]\nHaughey's victory was short-lived, as a series of political errors would lead to his demise as [[Taoiseach]]. Controversy erupted over the attempted appointment of [[Jim McDaid]] as Minister for Defence, which saw him resign from the post before he had been officially installed, under pressure from O'Malley. Worse was to follow when [[Se\u00e1n Doherty (Roscommon politician)|Se\u00e1n Doherty]], the man who as [[Minister for Justice and Equality|Minister for Justice]] had taken the blame for the [[Irish phone tapping scandal (1983)|phone-tapping scandal]] of the early 1980s, went on [[Raidi\u00f3 Teilif\u00eds \u00c9ireann|RT\u00c9]] television, and after ten years of insisting that Haughey knew nothing of the tapping, claimed that Haughey had known and authorised it.<ref name=rte-obituary/> Haughey denied this, but the [[Progressive Democrats]] members of the government stated that they could no longer continue in government with Haughey as Taoiseach. Haughey told Desmond O'Malley, the Progressive Democrats leader, that he intended to stand down shortly, but wanted to choose his own time of departure. O'Malley agreed to this and the government continued.\n\nOn 30 January 1992, Haughey resigned as leader of Fianna F\u00e1il at a parliamentary party meeting. He remained as [[Taoiseach]] until 11 February 1992, when he was succeeded by the former Finance Minister, [[Albert Reynolds]]. In his final address to the D\u00e1il he quoted [[Othello]], saying ''inter alia'' \"I have done the state some service, they know it, no more of that.\"  Haughey then returned to the backbenches before retiring from politics at the [[1992 Irish general election|1992 general election]]. His son, [[Se\u00e1n Haughey]], was elected at the election that followed, in his father's old constituency. Sean Haughey was appointed as a Junior Minister in the [[Department of Education and Skills (Ireland)|Department of Education and Science]] in December 2006.\n\n==Retirement, tribunals and scandal==\n{{Main|McCracken Tribunal|Moriarty Tribunal}}\n\n===Financial scandals===\nHaughey's personal wealth and extravagant lifestyle (he owned racehorses,<ref>Haughey's horse ''Flashing Steel'' won the [[Irish Grand National]] in 1995.</ref> a large motor sailing yacht ''Celtic Mist'', an [[Inishvickillane|Inishvickillane island]] and a [[James Gandon|Gandon]]-designed mansion) had long been a point of speculation.

The constituency lines were redrawn under the [[Electoral (Amendment) Act 1974]], in an attempt to secure re-election for the sitting [[Fine Gael]]-[[Labour Party (Ireland)|Labour Party]] government in [[1977 Irish general election|the 1977 election]], when Haughey switched to representing [[Dublin Artane (D\u00e1il constituency)|Dublin Artane]]; but this constituency was abolished in 1981 and most of Haughey's electoral area was moved into the reformed [[Dublin North-Central (D\u00e1il constituency)|Dublin North-Central]] constituency, which he represented from 1981 until his retirement in 1992.\n\nHaughey obtained his first government position, that of Parliamentary Secretary to the [[Minister for Justice (Ireland)|Minister for Justice]], to his constituency colleague [[Oscar Traynor]] in 1960. It is unclear whether the choice was made by Lemass directly as [[Taoiseach]], or by the cabinet against his wishes.<ref>Lemass was Haughey's father-in-law as well as Taoiseach.</ref> Lemass had advised Haughey;\n<blockquote>''As Taoiseach it is my duty to offer you the post of parliamentary secretary, and as your father-in-law I am advising you not to take it.''<ref>T. Ryle Dwyer, ''Short Fellow: A Biography of Charles J. Haughey'' (Marino, 1995) p.31.</ref></blockquote>\nHaughey ignored Lemass's advice and accepted the offer. Although officially junior to Traynor, Haughey was the ''de facto'' Minister.<ref>Traynor, a Minister from \u00c9amon de Valera's era, was elderly and in poor health, and only nominally running the department.</ref> Haughey and Traynor clashed openly.\n\nHaughey came to epitomise the new style of politician \u2013 the \"men in the mohair suits\". He regularly socialised with other younger cabinet colleagues, such as [[Donogh O'Malley]] and [[Brian Lenihan Snr|Brian Lenihan]].<ref name=it-3/>\n<blockquote>''By day he impressed the D\u00e1il. By night he basked in the admiration of a fashionable audience in the Russell Hotel. There, or in Dublin's more expensive restaurants, the company included artists, musicians and entertainers, professionals, builders and business people.''\n''His companions, Lenihan and O'Malley, took mischievous delight in entertaining the Russell with tales of the Old Guard. O'Malley in turn entertained the company in Limerick's Brazen Head or Cruise's Hotel with accounts of the crowd in the Russell. On the wings of such tales Haughey's reputation spread.''</blockquote>\n\nHaughey's status by 1961 was such that Leader of the Opposition [[James Dillon (Fine Gael politician)|James Dillon]] complimented him lavishly on the floor of the D\u00e1il, remarking on his opponent's \"skill with which he has had recourse to his brief,\" as well as his \"extraordinary erudition\" and \"his exceptional and outstanding ability.\"<ref>T.

As such, he initiated an extensive scale of legislative reforms. He introduced new legislation including the Adoption Act; the Succession Act, which protected the inheritance rights of wives and children;<ref name=it-8>[http://www.irishtimes.com/focus/haughey/ITstories/story8.htm  'Irish solutions for Irish problems'] \u2013 ''The Irish Times'' obituary.</ref> the Criminal Justice Act, which severely restricted the application of capital punishment; and the Extradition Act, which virtually prevented extradition for IRA offences. Haughey also introduced the Special Military Courts which helped to defeat the [[Irish Republican Army (1922\u20131969)|Irish Republican Army]]'s [[Border Campaign (Irish Republican Army)|Border Campaign]].<ref name=it-3/>\n\n===Minister for Agriculture: 1966 Farmers' Strike===\nIn 1964, Lemass appointed Haughey as [[Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine|Minister for Agriculture]].<ref>The previous Minister for Agriculture, [[Patrick Smith (politician)|Paddy Smith]], had resigned over a policy dispute.</ref> Criticism was voiced from the [[Irish Farmers' Association|National Farmers Association]] (NFA) of the appointment of a non-rural person to the position, and there was increased antagonism from farmers towards the government. Haughey became embroiled in a series of controversies with the NFA and with another organisation, the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers Association (ICMSA).<ref name=it-3/> Twenty-seven ICMSA picketers outside [[Leinster House]], were arrested on 27 April 1966 under the ''[[Offences Against the State Act]]'', an act originally intended for use against the IRA. 78 were arrested the following day, and 80 a day later as the dispute escalated. The general public was supportive of the farmers, who were not in a position to hold a strike to air their grievances, and who were clearly only posing a problem to the Minister, rather than the state. The farmers then began a national solidarity campaign, and even farmers who supported Fianna F\u00e1il turned against the government. Haughey, who did not rely on rural voters, was under intense pressure from fearful members of his own party to negotiate a deal and reduce the tension. It was Haughey's first alienation of a significant voting block, and probably damaged him electorally in later years as many farmers remembered the events, known in folk memory as the \"Farmers' Strike\".\n\n===Minister for Finance and 1966 presidential election===\nHaughey was appointed by Fianna F\u00e1il to run President [[\u00c9amon de Valera]]'s re-election campaign for the [[1966 Irish presidential election|1966 presidential election]]. His interventions proved highly controversial. [[Fine Gael]] chose a comparatively young [[Teachta D\u00e1la|TD]] and [[barrister]], [[Tom O'Higgins]] (nephew of [[Kevin O'Higgins]]), to run against de Valera. Aware that de Valera's age (84) and almost total blindness might compare unfavourably to O'Higgins, whose campaign drew comparisons with the equally youthful [[US President]] [[John F. Kennedy]], Haughey launched what was seen as a political stroke. He insisted that it was beneath the presidency to actively campaign, meaning that de Valera would have a low profile. Therefore, in the interests of fairness the media was asked to give O'Higgins an equally low profile, ignoring his speeches and publicity campaign. The print media, both nationally and locally, ignored Haughey's suggestion. But the state-run [[Raidi\u00f3 Teilif\u00eds \u00c9ireann]], facing criticism from Lemass' government for being too radical in other areas, agreed and largely ignored the O'Higgins campaign.\n\nDe Valera got a high media profile from a different source, the fiftieth anniversary commemoration of the [[Easter Rising]], of which he was the most senior survivor. While O'Higgins's campaign was ignored by RT\u00c9, de Valera appeared in RT\u00c9 coverage of the Rising events regularly. To add further to de Valera's campaign, Haughey as Agriculture Minister arranged<ref name=dib>{{cite web|url=http://www.ria.ie/research/dib/new-entries/haughey--charles-james-(c-j-).aspx |title=Dictionary of Irish Biography \u2013 Haughey, Charles James (C.J.) |last1=Maume |first1=Patrick |website=[[Royal Irish Academy]] |accessdate=24 October 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029184744/http://www.ria.ie/research/dib/new-entries/haughey--charles-james-%28c-j-%29.aspx |archivedate=29 October 2013 }}</ref> for milk price increases to be given to farmers on the eve of polling, as a way of reducing farmer disquiet after they had effectively become an opposition movement to the government.\n\nThese tactics should have ensured an easy de Valera victory. Instead O'Higgins came within less than one percent of winning the vote. The President was re-elected by a narrow margin of ten thousand votes out of a total of nearly one million. De Valera came to distrust Haughey. De Valera's Minister for Foreign Affairs and lifelong political confidant [[Frank Aiken]] dismissed Haughey's political motives as being entirely selfish, and believed he was motivated to hold power for its own sake and not duty.\n\nIn 1966, the [[Taoiseach]] [[Se\u00e1n Lemass]] retired. Haughey declared his candidature to succeed Lemass in the consequent [[1966 Fianna F\u00e1il leadership election|leadership election]], and [[George Colley]] and [[Neil Blaney]] did likewise. As this meant that there were three strong candidates who held strong and divisive views on the future of the party, the party elders sought to find a compromise candidate. Lemass himself encouraged his [[Minister for Finance]] [[Jack Lynch]], to contest the party leadership, and encouraged Colley, Haughey and Blaney to withdraw in favour of Lynch, arguing that they would not win a contest against him. However, Colley refused the Taoiseach's request and insisted on remaining in the race, but he was defeated by Lynch. Upon Lynch's election as Taoiseach, Haughey was appointed Minister for Finance by Lynch, in a cabinet reshuffle, which indicated that Haughey's withdrawal was a gain at the expense of Colley. The inexpensive and socially inclusive initiatives that Haughey made caught the public imagination; these included popular decisions to introduce free travel on public transport for pensioners, subsidise electricity for pensioners, the granting of special tax concessions for the disabled and tax exemptions for artists. They increased Haughey's populist appeal and his support from certain elements in the media and artistic community.\n\nAs Minister for Finance, Haughey on two occasions arranged foreign currency loans for the government which he then arranged to be left on deposit in foreign countries ([[Germany]] and the [[United States]]), in the local currencies, instead of immediately changing the loans to [[Irish punt]]s and depositing them in the exchequer. These actions were unconstitutional, because it effectively meant that the Minister for Finance was making a currency speculation against his own currency. When this was challenged by the Comptroller and Auditor General [[Eugene Francis Suttle]], Haughey introduced a law to retrospectively legalise his actions. The debate was very short and the record shows no understanding of the issue by the Opposition Spokesperson for Finance, O'Higgins for Fine Gael and Tully for Labour. The legislation was passed on 26 November 1969.\n\n===Arms crisis===\n{{More citations needed section|date=March 2007}}\n{{Main|Arms Crisis}}\nThe late 1960s saw the old tensions boil over into an eruption of violence in [[Northern Ireland]]. Haughey was generally seen as coming from the pragmatist wing of the party, and was not believed to have strong opinions on the matter, despite having family links with [[Derry]]. Indeed, many presumed that he had a strong [[antipathy]] to [[physical force Irish republicanism]]; during his period as Minister for Justice he had followed a tough anti-IRA line, including using [[internment]] without trial against the IRA. The ''hawks'' in the cabinet were seen as [[Kevin Boland]] and [[Neil Blaney]], both sons of founding fathers in the party with strong [[Irish Republican Army|Old IRA]] pasts. Blaney was also a TD for [[Donegal (town)|Donegal]]; a staunchly [[Irish Republicanism|Republican]] area which bordered [[Derry]]. They were opposed by those described as the \"doves\" of the cabinet; [[T\u00e1naiste]] [[Erskine Hamilton Childers|Erskine Childers]], [[George Colley]] and [[Patrick Hillery]]. A fund of \u00a3100,000 was set up to give to the Nationalist people in the form of aid. Haughey, as Finance Minister would have a central role in the management of this fund.\n\nThere was general surprise when, in an incident known as the ''[[Arms Crisis]]'', Haughey, along with Blaney, was sacked from Lynch's cabinet amid allegations of the use of the funds to import arms for use by the [[Irish Republican Army (1922\u20131969)|IRA]]. The Garda [[Special Detective Unit|Special Branch]] informed the Minister for Justice [[M\u00edche\u00e1l \u00d3 M\u00f3r\u00e1in]] and Taoiseach Jack Lynch that a plot to import arms existed and included government members, however Lynch took no action until the Special Branch made Leader of the Opposition [[Liam Cosgrave]] aware of the plot. Cosgrave told Lynch he knew of the plot and would announce it in the D\u00e1il the next day if he didn't act. Lynch subsequently requested Haughey and Blaney to resign from cabinet. Both men refused, saying they did nothing illegal. Lynch then asked President de Valera to terminate their appointments as members of the government, a request that de Valera was required to grant by convention. Boland resigned in sympathy, while M\u00edche\u00e1l \u00d3 M\u00f3r\u00e1in was dismissed one day earlier in a preemptive strike to ensure a subservient Minister for Justice was in place when the crisis broke. Lynch chose government chief whip Desmond O'Malley for the role. Haughey and Blaney were subsequently tried in court along with an army Officer, Captain [[James Kelly (Irish Army officer)|James Kelly]], and [[Albert Luykx]], a former Flemish [[National Socialist]] and businessman, who allegedly used his contacts to buy the arms.<ref name=dib /><ref>{{cite book |last1=Dillon |first1=Martin |author-link1=Martin Dillon|year=2012|title=The Dirty War |url=https://books.google.com/?id=er3HfXL7CKQC&pg=PA20&lpg=PA20&dq=charles+haughey+neil+blaney+james+kelly+albert+luykx+trial#v=onepage&q=charles%20haughey%20neil%20blaney%20james%20kelly%20albert%20luykx%20trial&f=false |publisher=[[Random House]]|page=20|isbn=9781407074801 |accessdate=24 October 2013}}</ref> After trial all the accused were acquitted but many refused to recognise the verdict of the courts. Although cleared of wrongdoing, it looked as if Haughey's political career was finished. Blaney and Boland eventually resigned from Fianna F\u00e1il but Haughey remained. He spent his years on the backbenches \u2013 the wilderness years \u2013 building support within the grassroots of the party; during this time, he remained loyal to the party and served the leader, but after the debacle of the \"arms crises\" neither man trusted the other.\n\n==Leadership years==\n{{More citations needed section|date=February 2007}}\n\n=== Opposition to Jack Lynch ===\nIn 1975, Fianna F\u00e1il was in opposition and Haughey had achieved enough grassroots support to warrant a recall to [[Jack Lynch]]'s opposition front bench. Haughey was appointed Spokesman on Health and Social Welfare, a fairly minor portfolio at the time, but Haughey used the same imagination and skill he displayed in other positions to formulate innovative and far reaching policies. Two years later in 1977, Fianna F\u00e1il returned to power with a massive parliamentary majority in [[D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann]], having had a very populist campaign (spearhead by Colley and O'Malley) to abolish rates, vehicle tax and other extraordinary concessions, which were short-lived. Haughey returned to the [[Irish Government|cabinet]], after an absence of seven years as [[Minister for Health (Ireland)|Minister for Health]] and [[Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection|Social Welfare]].\n\nIn this position he continued the progressive policies he had shown earlier by, among others, beginning the first government anti-smoking campaigns and legalising contraception, previously banned. Following the finding by the [[Supreme Court of Ireland]], in McGee v The Attorney General, that there was a constitutional right to use contraceptives, he introduced The Family Planning Bill which proved to be highly controversial. The bill allowed a pharmacist to sell contraceptives on presentation of a medical prescription. Haughey called this bill \"[[an Irish solution to an Irish problem]]\". It is often stated that the recipient of the prescription had to be married, but the legislation did not include this requirement.\n\nIt was also during this period that Lynch began to lose his grip on the party, the economy faltered in the aftermath of energy crises{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} and the fallout from the giveaway concessions that had re-elected the government under Lynch, led to a succession race to succeed Lynch. As well as this a group of backbenchers began to lobby in support of Haughey. This group, known as the \"gang of five,\" consisted of [[Jackie Fahey]], [[Tom McEllistrim (1926\u20132000)|Tom McEllistrim]], [[Se\u00e1n Doherty (Roscommon politician)|Se\u00e1n Doherty]], [[Mark Killilea Jnr]] and [[Albert Reynolds]]. Haughey was also helped by the [[Teachta D\u00e1la|TD]] [[S\u00edle de Valera]]. The granddaughter of [[\u00c9amon de Valera]], she was highly critical of [[Jack Lynch]]'s policy regards to Northern Ireland. In a speech at the Liam Lynch commemoration at [[Fermoy]] on 9 September, de Valera made a series of thinly veiled attacks on Lynch.<ref name=\"autogenerated182\">Down Down Deeper and Down \u2013 Ireland in the 70's and 80's \u2013 Eamon Sweeney \u2013 pg 182</ref> Although Lynch quickly tried to impose party discipline, attempting to discipline her for opposing party policy at a parliamentary party meeting held at the 28th, de Valera correctly pointed out that she had not opposed the party policy regarding Northern Ireland which called for the declaration of the British intent to withdraw from Northern Ireland.<ref name=\"autogenerated182\"/> Lynch left for a trip to the United States on 7 November. On the same day the government lost two by-elections to [[Fine Gael]] in [[Cork (city)|Cork]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://electionsireland.org/result.cfm?election=1977B&cons=51%20&ref=101|title=21st Dail By Elections \u2013 Cork City First Preference Votes|publisher=ElectionsIreland.org|accessdate=28 December 2010}}</ref> and in [[Cork North-East (D\u00e1il constituency)|Cork North-East]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://electionsireland.org/result.cfm?election=1977B&cons=58&ref=102|title=21st Dail By Elections \u2013 Cork North-East First Preference Votes|publisher=ElectionsIreland.org|accessdate=28 December 2010}}</ref> During the trip Lynch claimed in an interview with the [[Washington Post]] that a five-kilometer air corridor between the border was agreed upon during the meeting with [[British Prime Minister]] [[Margaret Thatcher]], to enhance security co-operation.<ref>Ireland in the 20th Century \u2013 Tim Pat Coogan</ref><ref>Down Down Deeper and Down \u2013 Ireland in the 70's and 80's \u2013 Eamon Sweeney \u2013 pg 186</ref> This was something highly unsavoury to many in [[Fianna F\u00e1il]]. When Lynch returned he was questioned on this by a [[County Clare|Clare]] backbencher [[Bill Loughnane]], along with [[Tom McEllistrim (1926\u20132000)|Tom McEllistrim]] at a parliamentary party meeting.<ref>Down Down Deeper and Down \u2013 Ireland in the 70's and 80's \u2013 Eamon Sweeney \u2013 pg 186 -187</ref> Lynch stated that the British did not have permission to overfly the border. Afterwards Loughnane went public with the details of the meeting and accused Lynch of deliberately misleading the party. An attempt to remove the whip from Loughnane failed. At this stage Lynch's position had become untenable, with supporters of Haughey and George Colley caucusing opinion within the party.\n\nIn December 1979, Lynch announced his resignation as [[Taoiseach]] and leader of [[Fianna F\u00e1il]]. The [[1979 Fianna F\u00e1il leadership election|leadership contest]] that resulted was a two-horse race between Haughey and the [[T\u00e1naiste]], [[George Colley]]. Colley had the support of the entire cabinet, with the exception of [[Michael O'Kennedy]], and felt that this popularity would be reflected within the parliamentary party as a whole.\n\nHaughey on the other hand was distrusted by a number of his Cabinet colleagues, but was much more respected by new backbenchers who were worried about the safety of their D\u00e1il seats. When the vote was taken Haughey emerged as the victor by a margin of 44 votes to 38, a very clear division within the party. In a conciliatory gesture, Colley was re-appointed as [[T\u00e1naiste]] and had a veto over whom Haughey would appoint as Ministers for Justice and for Defence. This was due to his distrust of Haughey on security issues (because of the Arms Crisis). However, he was removed from the important position of Minister for Finance.\n\nNonetheless, on 11 December 1979, Charles Haughey was elected [[Taoiseach]] and leader of [[Fianna F\u00e1il]], almost a decade after the Arms Crisis nearly destroyed his political career. In 2010, a founder of the [[Saatchi & Saatchi]] advertising firm, said that Haughey had asked for 'a new image' similar to the one provided for [[Margaret Thatcher]] for the [[1979 United Kingdom general election|1979 general election]].<ref>[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/ireland/article7017966.ece Haughey \u2018wanted a new image\u2019] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604184540/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/ireland/article7017966.ece |date=4 June 2011 }}</ref>\n\n===7th Taoiseach (1979\u20131981)===\nWhen Haughey came to power, the country was sinking into a deep economic crisis, following the [[1979 energy crisis]]. Haughey effectively acted as his own Minister for Finance, ignoring the views of his Minister. One of his first functions as Taoiseach was a televised address to the nation \u2013 only the third such address in the Republic's history \u2013 in which he outlined the bleak economic picture:<ref>[https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/haughey-1-14m-in-debt-went-on-tv-to-lecture-the-nation-on-overspending-1.1258709 Haughey, \u00a31.14m in debt, went on TV to lecture the nation on overspending],\n''[[Irish Times]]'', January 30, 1999</ref>\n\n{{cquote|I wish to talk to you this evening about the state of the nation's affairs and the picture I have to paint is not, unfortunately, a very cheerful one. The figures which are just now becoming available to us show one thing very clearly. '''As a community we are living away beyond our means'''. I don't mean that everyone in the community is living too well, clearly many are not and have barely enough to get by, but taking us all together we have been living at a rate which is simply not justified by the amount of goods and services we are producing. To make up the difference we have been borrowing enormous amounts of money, borrowing at a rate which just cannot continue. A few simple figures will make this very clear...we will just have to reorganise government spending so that we can only undertake those things we can afford... |14px|14px|Charles Haughey, 9 January 1980}}\n\nWhile Haughey had identified the problem with the economy, his actions made the problem worse. He increased public spending, which soon became out of control, and led to increases in borrowing and taxation at an unacceptable level. By 1981, Haughey was still reasonably popular and decided to call a general election. However, the timing of the election was thwarted twice by external events, in particular the [[hunger strike]]s of [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|IRA]] volunteers for political status. The [[Anti H-Block|Anti H-Block Committee]] announced that they would field abstentionist candidates which many predicted correctly would take Republican votes away from [[Fianna F\u00e1il]]. This coincided with the [[Stardust Disaster]], where a fire destroyed a night club in Haughey's constituency and claimed the lives of 48 young people; these caused Haughey to delay the Ard Fheis and the election. The [[1981 Irish general election|poll was eventually held in June]], much later than Haughey wanted. In the hope of winning an overall D\u00e1il majority Haughey's campaign took a populist line with regard to taxation, spending and Northern Ireland. The campaign was enhanced and hyped up by a live debate on [[Raidi\u00f3 Teilif\u00eds \u00c9ireann|RT\u00c9]] between Haughey and the Leader of the Opposition [[Garret FitzGerald]], of Fine Gael, over the major issues. On the day of the vote Fianna F\u00e1il won 45.5%, failing to secure a majority in the 166-seat D\u00e1il. A [[Fine Gael]]\u2013[[Labour Party (Ireland)|Labour Party]] coalition came to power, under FitzGerald and Haughey went into opposition.\n\nWithin days of his becoming Taoiseach, [[Allied Irish Banks]] forgave Haughey \u00a3400,000 of a \u00a31,000,000 debt. No reason was given for this. [[The Economist]] obituary on Haughey (24 June 2006) asserted that he had warned the bank \"I can be a very troublesome adversary\".\n\n===Opposition (1981\u20131982)===\nFitzGerald's government lasted until January 1982, when it collapsed due to a controversial budget which proposed the application of Value Added Tax to children's shoes, previously exempt.

However, the night the government collapsed the Fianna F\u00e1il Front Bench issued a statement encouraging the President not to grant the dissolution and to allow Fianna F\u00e1il to form a government. Phone calls were also made to the President by [[Brian Lenihan Snr|Brian Lenihan]].<ref>This attempted contact with the President proved a major embarrassment to Lenihan subsequently in 1990.</ref> Haughey, on attempting to contact his former colleague, the President, and on failing to be put through to him, was reported to have threatened the President's [[aide de camp]] by telling him that he would be Taoiseach one day and when that happened, ''I intend to roast your fucking arse if you don't put me through immediately''.<ref>Finlay, Fergus ''Snakes and Ladders'' pub:New Island Books 1998.

Some of Haughey's critics in the party suggested that an alternative candidate should stand as the party's nominee for [[Taoiseach]]. [[Desmond O'Malley]] emerged as the likely alternative candidate and was ready to challenge Haughey for the leadership. However, on the day of the vote O'Malley withdrew and Haughey went forward as the nominee. He engineered [[confidence and supply]] agreements with the Independent Socialist TD, [[Tony Gregory]] (in return for \u00a3100 million of investment in the Dublin North Inner City; a deal dubbed the Gregory Deal), the [[Independent Fianna F\u00e1il]] TD [[Neil Blaney]] and three [[Workers' Party of Ireland|Workers' Party]] TDs, which saw him return as Taoiseach for a second time.\n\nHaughey's second term was dominated by even more economic mismanagement, based on Haughey's policy of using government policy and money, in an effort to induce a sufficiently large share of the electorate to vote him his elusive 'overall majority' in the D\u00e1il. With Haughey and his supporters taking a dangerously populist line in every area of policy, and refusing to address serious shortcomings in the performance of the state, a growing minority in his own party were becoming increasingly concerned. The issue of his leadership cropped up again when in October the backbench TD, [[Charlie McCreevy]], put down a motion of no-confidence in Haughey. Desmond O'Malley disagreed with the timing but supported the hasty motion of no confidence all the same. O'Malley resigned from the cabinet prior to the vote as he was going to vote against Haughey. A campaign now started that was extremely vicious on the side of Haughey's supporters, with threats made to the careers of those who dissented from the leadership. After a marathon 15-hour party meeting, Haughey, who insisted on a roll-call as opposed to a secret ballot, and won the open ballot by 58 votes to 22. Not long after this, Haughey's government collapsed when the Workers' Party TD's and [[Tony Gregory]] withdrew their support for the government over a Fianna F\u00e1il policy document called \"The Way Forward,\" which would lead to massive spending cuts. Fianna F\u00e1il lost the [[November 1982 Irish general election|November 1982 election]] and FitzGerald once again returned as Taoiseach at the head of a Fine Gael-Labour coalition with a comfortable D\u00e1il majority. Haughey found himself back in opposition.\n\nDuring this tenure of Haughey, the [[GUBU|''GUBU'' Incidents]], involving the [[Attorney General of Ireland|Attorney General]] to his Government, occurred in Dublin. At a press-conference on the affair, Haughey was paraphrased as having described the affair as ''\"grotesque, unbelievable, bizarre and unprecedented\"'', from which journalist and former politician [[Conor Cruise O'Brien]] coined the term [[GUBU]].\n\n===Return to opposition (1982\u20131987)===\nHaughey's leadership came under scrutiny for a third time when a report linked Haughey with the [[Irish phone tapping scandal (1983)|phone tapping of political journalists]]. In spite of huge pressure Haughey refused to resign and survived yet another vote of no-confidence in early 1983, albeit with a smaller majority. Haughey's success was partly due to the death of the Fianna F\u00e1il TD [[Clement Coughlan]], a supporter of O'Malley. Haughey's supporters managed to have the meeting moved to the following week after the funeral, which gave him more time to manoeuver. Having failed three times to oust Haughey, most of his critics gave up and returned to normal politics.\n\nIn May 1984, the New-Ireland Forum Report was published. Haughey was involved in the drafting of this at the time he was in office and had agreed to potential scenarios for improving the political situation of Northern Ireland. However, on publication, Haughey rejected it and said the only possible solution was a United Ireland. This statement was criticised by the other leaders who forged the New-Ireland Forum, [[John Hume]], Garret FitzGerald and [[Dick Spring]]. Desmond O'Malley supported the Forum report and criticised Haughey's ambiguous position, accusing him of stifling debate. At a Fianna F\u00e1il Parliamentary Party meeting to discuss the report, the whip was removed from O'Malley, which meant he was no longer a Fianna F\u00e1il TD. Ironically, when Haughey returned to power he embraced the [[Anglo-Irish Agreement]] that had developed from the New Ireland Forum Report.\n\nIn early 1985, a bill was introduced by the Fine Gael-Labour government to liberalise the sale of contraceptives in the country. [[Fianna F\u00e1il]] in opposition opposed the bill. O'Malley supported it as a matter of principle rather than a political point to oppose for opposition's sake. On the day of the vote O'Malley spoke in the D\u00e1il chamber stated:\n\n<blockquote>\n ''But I do not believe that the interests of this State or our Constitution and of this Republic would be served by putting politics before conscience in regard to this .... I stand by the Republic and accordingly, I will not oppose this Bill.''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://historical-debates.oireachtas.ie/D/0356/D.0356.198502200003.html |title=D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann \u2013 Volume 356 |publisher=Oireachtas historical |date=20 February 1985 |accessdate=2 December 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607111737/http://historical-debates.oireachtas.ie/D/0356/D.0356.198502200003.html |archivedate= 7 June 2011 }}</ref></blockquote>\n\nHe abstained rather than vote with the government. Despite this Haughey moved against O'Malley and in February 1985, O'Malley was charged with \"conduct un-becoming\". At a Party meeting, even though O'Malley did not have the Party whip, he was expelled from the Fianna F\u00e1il organisation by 73 votes to 9 in roll-call vote. With [[George Colley]] dead, O'Malley expelled and other critics silenced, Haughey was finally in full control of Fianna F\u00e1il.\n\nO'Malley decided to form a new political party and 21 December 1985, Desmond O'Malley announced the formation of the [[Progressive Democrats]]. Several Fianna F\u00e1il TDs joined including [[Mary Harney]] and [[Bobby Molloy]].\n\nIn November 1985, the [[Anglo-Irish Agreement]] was signed between Garret FitzGerald and British Prime Minister [[Margaret Thatcher]]. The agreement gave [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] a formal say in [[Northern Ireland]] and its affairs. As was the case with the New Ireland Forum Report, the Anglo-Irish Agreement was harshly criticised by Haughey, who said that he would re-negotiate it, if re-elected. FitzGerald called a general election for February 1987. The campaign was dominated by attacks on the government over severe cuts in the budget and the general mismanagement of the economy. When the results were counted Haughey had failed once again to win an overall majority for Fianna F\u00e1il. When it came to electing a Taoiseach in the D\u00e1il Haughey's position looked particularly volatile. When it came to a vote the Independent TD [[Tony Gregory]] voted against Fitzgerald but abstained on Haughey, seeing Haughey as the \"lesser of two evils\" (the reason for this was Gregory's opposition to the Anglo-Irish agreement as well as his personal dislike of Garrett Fitzgerald and Fine Gael). Haughey was elected Taoiseach on the casting vote of the [[Ceann Comhairle]].\n\n===Final term as Taoiseach (1987\u20131992)===\n{{More citations needed section|date=December 2006}}\nHaughey now headed a minority [[Fianna F\u00e1il]] government. [[Fine Gael]] under leader [[Alan Dukes]], made the unprecedented move, with its [[Tallaght strategy]], of supporting the government and voting for it when it came to introducing tough economic policies. The national debt had doubled under previous administrations, so the government introduced severe budget cuts in all departments. The taxation system was transformed to encourage enterprise and employment. One of the major schemes put forward, and one which would have enormous economic benefits for the country, was the establishment of the [[International Financial Services Centre]] (IFSC) in [[Dublin]].\n[[File:Rueda de prensa de Felipe Gonz\u00e1lez y el primer ministro de Irlanda.

The government lost the vote, which was seen as merely embarrassing, but Haughey, buoyed by opinion polls which indicated the possibility of winning an overall majority, called a general election for 15 June. [[Fianna F\u00e1il]] however ended up losing four seats and the possibility of forming another minority government looked slim. For the first time in history a nominee for [[Taoiseach]] failed to achieve a majority when a vote was taken in the D\u00e1il, on 29 June 1989.<ref name=IrishTimes27Feb2016a>{{cite news |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/opinion/1989-a-road-map-for-fine-gael-fianna-f%C3%A1il-deal-1.2550069|title=1989 a road map for Fine Gael-Fianna F\u00e1il deal|newspaper=The Irish Times|author=Stephen O'Byrnes| date=27 February 2016|accessdate=21 March 2017}}</ref> Constitutionally Haughey was obliged to resign, however he refused to, for a short period. He eventually tendered his resignation to President [[Patrick Hillery|Hillery]] and remained on as Taoiseach, albeit in an acting capacity.<ref name=IrishTimes27Feb2016a/> A full 27 days after the election had taken place a coalition government was formed between Fianna F\u00e1il and the [[Progressive Democrats]]. It was the first time that Fianna F\u00e1il had entered into a coalition, abandoning one of its \"core values\" in the overwhelming need to form a government.<ref name=rte-obituary/>\n\nHaughey in 1990 had more difficulties than successes. The first half of the year saw Haughey in a leading role as European statesman, when Ireland held the presidency of the [[European Community]], which rotated semi-annually between the member states of the [[European Union]]. Haughey supported [[German Reunification]] and during the extraordinary [[List of European Council meetings|Dublin Summit]], which he called for in April, he pressed this viewpoint forward.<ref>[http://aei.pitt.edu/1397/1/Dublin_april_1990.pdf The European Council, Dublin, 28 April 1990]</ref><ref>[http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_DOC-90-1_en.htm?locale=en European Commission, Press Release Database]</ref><ref>[http://www.irishtimes.com/news/germany-will-never-forget-ireland-s-help-1.658399 Germany Will Never Forget Ireland\u00b4s Help, ''Irish Times'']</ref><ref>European Commission, Ireland\u00b4s Previous Presidencies, {{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/ireland/how_the_eu_works/presidency/index_en.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-07-08 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150711144901/http://ec.europa.eu/ireland/how_the_eu_works/presidency/index_en.htm |archivedate=11 July 2015 |df=dmy }}</ref> He believed both [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] and [[Germany]] were similar in that both countries were divided. During a [[D\u00e1il]] debate on [[German Reunification]], Haughey stated \"I have expressed a personal view that coming as we do from a country which is also divided many of us would have sympathy with any wish of the people of the two German States for unification\".<ref>[http://debates.oireachtas.ie/dail/1989/12/13/00007.asp German Reunification, Houses of the Oireachtas, D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann]</ref>\n\nThe [[1990 Irish presidential election|Presidential election]] was disappointing for Haughey with Brian Lenihan, the [[T\u00e1naiste]], who was nominated as the party's candidate, being defeated by [[Mary Robinson]]. During the campaign the controversy over the phone calls made to the [[\u00c1ras an Uachtar\u00e1in]] in 1982, urging the then President not to dissolve the D\u00e1il resurfaced. Lenihan was accused of calling and attempting to influence the President, who as [[Head of State]] is above politics. The Progressive Democrats threatened to pull out of the coalition and support a Fine Gael no-confidence motion unless Haughey forced Lenihan out. Haughey tried to force Lenihan to resign, and sacked him when he refused to do so. Lenihan's dismissal damaged Haughey's standing in the Fianna F\u00e1il organisation.\n\nHaughey's grip on political power began to slip in the autumn of 1991. There was a series of resignations by chairmen of semi-state companies, followed by an open declaration by [[Minister for Finance (Ireland)|Minister for Finance]] [[Albert Reynolds]], that he had every intention of standing for the party leadership if Haughey resigned. Following a heated parliamentary party meeting, [[Se\u00e1n Power (politician)|Se\u00e1n Power]], one of Reynolds's supporters, put down a motion of no-confidence in Haughey. Reynolds and his supporters were sacked from the government by Haughey, who went on to win the no-confidence motion by 55 votes to 22.\n\n[[File:Plaque at former Hells Kitchen pub Castlerea (2018).jpg|thumb|Plaque at the [[Hells Kitchen Railway Museum]], [[Castlerea]].]]\nHaughey's victory was short-lived, as a series of political errors would lead to his demise as [[Taoiseach]]. Controversy erupted over the attempted appointment of [[Jim McDaid]] as Minister for Defence, which saw him resign from the post before he had been officially installed, under pressure from O'Malley. Worse was to follow when [[Se\u00e1n Doherty (Roscommon politician)|Se\u00e1n Doherty]], the man who as [[Minister for Justice and Equality|Minister for Justice]] had taken the blame for the [[Irish phone tapping scandal (1983)|phone-tapping scandal]] of the early 1980s, went on [[Raidi\u00f3 Teilif\u00eds \u00c9ireann|RT\u00c9]] television, and after ten years of insisting that Haughey knew nothing of the tapping, claimed that Haughey had known and authorised it.<ref name=rte-obituary/> Haughey denied this, but the [[Progressive Democrats]] members of the government stated that they could no longer continue in government with Haughey as Taoiseach. Haughey told Desmond O'Malley, the Progressive Democrats leader, that he intended to stand down shortly, but wanted to choose his own time of departure. O'Malley agreed to this and the government continued.\n\nOn 30 January 1992, Haughey resigned as leader of Fianna F\u00e1il at a parliamentary party meeting. He remained as [[Taoiseach]] until 11 February 1992, when he was succeeded by the former Finance Minister, [[Albert Reynolds]]. In his final address to the D\u00e1il he quoted [[Othello]], saying ''inter alia'' \"I have done the state some service, they know it, no more of that.\"  Haughey then returned to the backbenches before retiring from politics at the [[1992 Irish general election|1992 general election]]. His son, [[Se\u00e1n Haughey]], was elected at the election that followed, in his father's old constituency. Sean Haughey was appointed as a Junior Minister in the [[Department of Education and Skills (Ireland)|Department of Education and Science]] in December 2006.\n\n==Retirement, tribunals and scandal==\n{{Main|McCracken Tribunal|Moriarty Tribunal}}\n\n===Financial scandals===\nHaughey's personal wealth and extravagant lifestyle (he owned racehorses,<ref>Haughey's horse ''Flashing Steel'' won the [[Irish Grand National]] in 1995.</ref> a large motor sailing yacht ''Celtic Mist'', an [[Inishvickillane|Inishvickillane island]] and a [[James Gandon|Gandon]]-designed mansion) had long been a point of speculation.

Some of the more prominent members of the association were [[George Granville Bradley]], Master of [[University College, Oxford|University College]], [[T. H. Green]], a prominent liberal philosopher and Fellow of [[Balliol College]], and [[Edward Stuart Talbot]], Warden of [[Keble College, Oxford|Keble College]]. Talbot insisted on a specifically [[Anglican]] institution, which was unacceptable to most of the other members. The two parties eventually split, and Talbot's group (the \"[[Christ Church, Oxford|Christ Church]] camp\") founded [[Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford|Lady Margaret Hall]], which opened its doors for students in 1879, the same year as Somerville did.{{sfn |Brockliss |2016 |p=374}}\n\nThus, in 1879, a second committee was formed to create a college \"in which no distinction will be made between students on the ground of their belonging to different religious denominations.\"{{efn|Originally LMH only admitted students who were practicing members of the [[Church of England]].{{sfn |Brockliss |2016 |p=374}}}}{{sfn |Batson |2008 |pp=22-23}} This committee was called the \"[[Balliol College, Oxford|Balliol]] camp\" and had close ties to the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]].{{sfn |Batson |2008 |p=21}}{{sfn |Adams |1996 |p=11}} This second committee included [[Sir Arthur Dyke Acland, 13th Baronet|A.

G. Vernon Harcourt]] and [[Mary Augusta Ward|Mary Ward]].{{sfn |Adams |1996 |p=11}} Other people who assisted in the founding were [[Anna Swanwick]] and [[Owen Roberts (educator)|Owen Roberts]].\n\nThis new effort resulted in the founding of ''Somerville Hall'', named after the then recently deceased Scottish mathematician and renowned scientific writer [[Mary Somerville]].{{sfn |Brockliss |2016 |p=374}} It was felt that the name would reflect the virtues of liberalism and academic success which the college wished to embody.{{sfn |Batson |2008 |p=23}} She was admired by the founders of the college as a scholar, as well as for her religious and political views, including her conviction that women should have equality in terms of suffrage and access to education.\n\n[[Madeleine Shaw-Lefevre]] was chosen as the first principal because, although not a well-known academic at the time, her background was felt to reflect the college's political stance.{{sfn |Batson |2008 |p=24}} Because of its status as both women's college and non-denominational institution, Somerville was widely regarded within Oxford as \"an eccentric and somewhat alarming institution.\"{{sfn |Batson |2008 |p=25}}\n\n[[File:Thomas Phillips - Mary Fairfax, Mrs William Somerville, 1780 - 1872.

Somerville appointed its first in-house tutor in 1892 and, by the end of the 1890s, female students were permitted to attend lectures in almost all colleges.{{sfn |Brockliss |2016 |p=375; 418}} In 1891 it became the first women's hall to introduce entrance exams and in 1894 the first of the five women's halls of residence to adopt the title of college (changing its name to Somerville College),{{sfn |Adams |1996 |p=47}} the first of them to appoint its own teaching staff, and the first to build [[Somerville College Library|a library]].{{sfn |Manuel |2013 |p=9}} In Oxford legend it soon became known as the \"[[bluestocking]] college\", its excellent examination results refuting the widespread belief that women were incapable of high academic achievement.{{sfn |Manuel |2013 |p=9}}\n\nIn the 1910s, Somerville became known for its support for the [[Women's suffrage in the United Kingdom|women's suffrage]] campaign.{{sfn |Adams |1996 |p=78}} In 1920, Oxford University allowed women to matriculate and therefore gain degrees.{{sfn |Batson |2008 |p=xv}} From the college's inception, all female students had to be chaperoned when in the presence of male students. The practice was abolished in 1925, although male visitors to the college were still subject to a curfew.{{sfn |Adams |1996 |p=215}} In the same year the college was granted its charter.\n\n===First World War===\nDuring the [[World War I|First World War]], Somerville College together with the [[Examination Schools]] and other Oxford buildings were requisitioned by the [[War Office]] to create the Third Southern General Hospital, a facility for the [[Royal Army Medical Corps]] to treat military casualties.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordhistory.org.uk/war/military_hospitals/|title=Military Hospitals|publisher=Oxford History|accessdate=22 July 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.some.ox.ac.uk/about-somerville/history/somerville-hospital-then-and-now/ |title=Somerville Hospital \u2013 Then and Now |access-date=27 August 2018 |publisher=Somerville College}}</ref> For the duration of the war, Somerville students relocated to [[Oriel College, Oxford|Oriel College]].{{sfn |Adams |1996 |p=78}} Because many male students had left Oxford to enlist in the military, Somerville was able to rent [[St Mary Hall, Oxford|St Mary Hall Quad]] which they bricked off from the rest of the college to segregate it from Oriel's remaining male students.{{sfn |Adams |1996 |p=89}} Many students and tutors were involved in work in World War I and some of them went to the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] in [[France]].\n\nNotable patients who stayed in Somerville include [[Robert Graves]] and [[Siegfried Sassoon]]. Sassoon arrived on 2 August 1916. Graves and Sassoon were both to reminisce of their time at Somerville Hospital: ''How unlike you to crib my idea of going to the Ladies' College at Oxford'', Sassoon wrote to Graves in 1917, and called it ''very much like Paradise''.<ref>{{cite book |last=Sassoon |first=Siegfried |authorlink=Siegfried Sassoon |date=1945 |title=Siegfried's Journey, 1916-1920 |page=5}}</ref> At Somerville College, Graves met his first love, a nurse and professional pianist called Marjorie.

Somerville remained a women's college until 1992, when its statutes were amended to permit male students and fellows; the first male fellows were appointed in 1993, and the first male students admitted in 1994.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/higher-education-blue-stockings-greet-blue-socks-somerville-college-oxford-is-preparing-to-admit-its-1505082.html |title=Higher Education: Blue stockings greet blue socks: Somerville College Oxford is preparing to admit its first men next year |first=Stephen |last=Pritchard |date=18 November 1993 |newspaper=[[The Independent]]}}</ref> Somerville became the second-to-last college (after [[St Hilda's College, Oxford|St Hilda's]]) to become coeducational.{{sfn |Brockliss |2016 |p=573}} A 50 per cent male/female gender balance has been maintained to this day, though without formal quotas.<ref name=laddism>[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/may/15/sexist-laddism-abuse-somerville-college-oxford How we are fighting sexist laddism and abuse at Somerville College, Oxford], Alice Prochaska, ''[[The Guardian]]'', 15 May 2015</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://public.tableau.com/views/UniversityofOxford-StudentStatistics/CollegeBreakdown?%3Aembed=y&%3Adisplay_count=yes&%3AshowTabs=y&%3AshowVizHome=no#3 |title=Student Statistics - Sex |publisher=University of Oxford |date=2017 |access-date=10 September 2018}}</ref>\n\n{{Quote|text=In the 1890s Somerville helped fashion the \"New Woman\"; a century later... the college has set itself the perhaps greater challenge of educating the \"New Man.\" |author=Pauline Adams, ''Somerville for Women'' (1996){{sfn |Adams |1996 |p=363}}}}\n\n==Buildings and grounds==\n[[File:Somerville College, Oxford - House.JPG|thumb|right|House seen from the Quad]]\nThe college and its main entrance, the Porters' Lodge, are located at the southern end of [[Woodstock Road, Oxford|Woodstock Road]], with [[Little Clarendon Street]] to the south, [[Walton Street]] to the west and the [[Radcliffe Observatory Quarter]] to the north. The front of the college runs between the [[Oxford Oratory]] and the [[Faculty of Philosophy, Oxford|Faculty of Philosophy]]. Somerville has buildings of various architectural styles, many of which bear the names of former principals of the college, located around one of Oxford's biggest [[quadrangle (architecture)|quads]]. Five buildings are [[listed building#England and Wales|Grade II]]-listed.\n\nA 2017 archaeological evaluation of the site shows that in the medieval period the area now occupied by Somerville lay in fields beyond the boundary of Oxford. There is evidence of 17th-century building and earthworks beneath the site, some of which almost certainly relates to the defensive network placed around the city by [[Cavalier|Royalists]] during the [[Wars of the Three Kingdoms|Civil War]]. There are also remains of some 19th-century buildings, including a stone-lined well.<ref name=hughes>{{cite web |url=http://www.some.ox.ac.uk/about-somerville/the-catherine-hughes-building/ |title=The Catherine Hughes Building |access-date=30 August 2018 |website=www.some.ox.ac.uk}}</ref>\n\n===Walton House===\n[[File:Walton House, Somerville College, Oxford.jpg|thumb|right|House seen from the east]]\nThe original building of Somerville Hall, Walton House (commonly called House) was built in 1826 and purchased from [[St John's College, Oxford|St John's College]] in 1880 amid fears that the men's colleges might, in the future, repossess the site for their own purposes.{{sfn |Batson |2008 |p=26}} The house could only accommodate seven of the twelve students who came up to Oxford in the first year.<ref name=\"british-history.ac.uk\">{{cite web |url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=63899#n43 |title=Somerville College \u2013 British History Online |website=british-history.ac.uk}}</ref> In 1881, Sir [[Thomas Graham Jackson]] was commissioned to build a new south wing which could accommodate eleven more students. In 1892, [[Walter Cave]] added a north wing and an extra storey. He also installed a gatehouse at the Woodstock Road entrance. In 1897/98, the Eleanor Smith Cottages were added, adjoining Walton House.{{sfn |Manuel |2013 |p=11}}\n\nToday House is home to only one or two students, and, until 2014, it housed the college bar. It also contains Green Hall, where guests to college are often greeted and in which prospective students are registered and wait for interviews; some of the college's paintings by [[Roger Fry]] are located here.<ref name=artuk /> Most of the administration of college, and the academic [[pigeon-hole messagebox|pigeon-holes]] are in House, as is the Mary Somerville Room, a reception room featuring paintings by Mary Somerville, [[George Romney (painter)|George Romney]] and [[George Frederic Watts]].<ref name=artuk />\n\n===Park===\n[[File:Park Building, Somerville College, Oxford University.jpg|thumb|right|Park Building]]\nOriginally known as West, due to its location within the college, the idea of building a second self-contained hall was inspired by [[Newnham College, Cambridge]]. The building was designed by [[Harry Wilkinson Moore]] and built in two stages. The 1885\u20131887 phase saw the construction of rooms for 18 students with their own dining-room, sitting rooms and vice-principal. This was a deliberate policy aimed at replicating the family environment that the women students had left.{{sfn |Manuel |2013 |p=11}} This arrangement had the effect of turning House and West into rivals.{{sfn |Manuel |2013 |p=12}} The second building stage (1888\u20131895) created two sets of tutors' rooms, a further 19 rooms and the West Lodge (now Park Lodge).<ref name=\"british-history.ac.uk\"/> In 2004 it was renamed Park in honour of [[Daphne Park]], the principal from 1980 to 1989.{{sfn |Manuel |2013 |p=12}}\n\nToday there are over 60 student and fellows' rooms within the building, as well as a music room and a computer room. Park is a Grade II-listed building.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://historicengland.org.uk/listing/the-list/list-entry/1369711 |title=SOMERVILLE COLLEGE, WEST BUILDING |access-date=16 September 2018 |website=[[Historic England]]}}</ref>\n\n===Library===\n{{Main|Somerville College Library}}\n[[File:Somerville College Library.jpg|thumb|right|[[Somerville College Library]]]]\nThe Grade II-listed library was designed by [[Basil Champneys]] in 1903 and opened by [[John Morley]] the following year. Specially for this opening, ''Demeter'' was written by [[Robert Bridges]] and performed for the first time. Somerville Library was the first purpose-built library in the women's colleges of the university. With some foresight it was deisgned to contain 60,000 volumes, although the college only possessed 6,000 when it was opened. It now holds around 120,000 items (95,000 on open shelves), making it one of the largest college libraries in the university.{{sfn |Manuel |2013 |p=16}}\n\n[[Amelia Edwards]], [[John Stuart Mill]], [[John Ruskin]] and [[Vera Brittain]] have been notable benefactors to the library.{{sfn |Manuel |2013 |p=16}} The library contains paintings by Mary Somerville, [[John Constable]], [[Maud Sumner]] and [[Patrick George]].<ref name=artuk />\n\nThe John Stuart Mill room contains what was Mill's personal library in London at the time of his death, with significant annotations in many of the books.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.some.ox.ac.uk/library-it/special-collections/john-stuart-mill-collection/ |title=John Stuart Mill Collection \u2013 Somerville College Oxford |publisher=University of Oxford |access-date=8 June 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe library dominates the north wing of the main quadrangle (having been designed to bring the college together) and is open 24 hours, with access to college-wide wifi, a group study room, and computing and printing facilities.

A. L. Fisher]], the Vice-Chancellor of the University and [[Gilbert Murray]].{{sfn|Manuel|2013|p=22}} Murray, whose translations of Greek drama were performed at Somerville in 1912 and 1946, supported Somerville in many ways, including endowing its first research fellowship. A fund was raised as a memorial to [[Agnes Catherine Maitland|Miss Maitland]], the principal of Somerville Hall (College from 1894) from 1889 to 1906, and this money was used to pay for the oak panelling in Hall. The panelling of the south wall was specially designed to frame the portrait of [[Mary Somerville]] by [[John Jackson (painter)|John Jackson]].{{sfn |Manuel |2013 |p=19}} The buildings were constructed on the site of an adjoining building gifted to Somerville by E. J. Forester in 1897 and bought from [[University College, Oxford|University]] and [[Balliol College, Oxford|Balliol]] Colleges for \u00a34,000 and \u00a31,400 respectively.<ref name=\"british-history.ac.uk\"/> There was difficulty in the construction of the buildings, which is now thought to have been the result of the outer limit of the Oxford city fortifications running under the site. In 1935, [[Percy Richard Morley Horder|Morley Horder]] reconstructed the archway which connected Maitland Hall and the south wing of Walton House, creating the Reading Room off the main hall and, in 1947, [[Andr\u00e9 Gide]] gave a lecture which filled not only both of these rooms, but the staircase and the quadrangle outside.{{sfn |Manuel |2013 |p=22}}\n\nSomerville's dining hall is the only Oxford dining hall where all the portraits show women.

In 1920, three houses (29, 31 and 33) were purchased by the college from the vicar of [[St Giles' Church, Oxford]], for the sum of \u00a31,300. The three properties were constructed in 1859 and had been rented by the college prior to their purchase. The adjoining ''Waggon and Horses'' was purchased from [[St John's College, Oxford]], in 1923. These buildings were demolished between 1932 and 1933 together with the old Gate House.\n\n[[Percy Richard Morley Horder|Morley Horder]] was commissioned to build a quadrangle which would fill the space left by the demolished structures, using a loan of \u00a312,000 from [[Christ Church, Oxford|Christ Church]]. The porters' lodge and a New Council Room were constructed at the entrance to the quad, which housed undergraduates and fellows.<ref name=\"british-history.ac.uk\"/> The coat of arms of Somerville and those of co-founder [[John Percival (bishop)|John Percival]], first principal [[Madeleine Shaw-Lefevre]] and Helen Darbishire were carved by Edmund Ware inside the quadrangle. The archway leading to Hall was reconstructed in 1938.\n\nOriginally this was called the East Quadrangle. It was opened in June 1934 by [[Edward Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax|Lord Halifax]], who called it \"a notable addition to buildings of varying styles\" (''varii generis aedificiia additamentum nobile'') in the [[Creweian Oration]] during the [[Encaenia]]. Darbishire was renamed in 1962 in honour of the principal of the college during its construction, [[Helen Darbishire]].{{sfn |Manuel |2013 |p=26}}\n\nToday Darbishire contains some 50 student rooms, along with tutors' offices, the college archive and a medical room.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> The offices of the [[Global Ocean Commission]], co-chaired by [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Figueres]], [[Trevor Manuel]] and [[David Miliband]], were situated in Darbishire as part of a partnership with Somerville from 2012 to 2016, when the organisation completed its work.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.globaloceancommission.org/about-the-commission/contact/ |title=contact \u2013 Somerville College Oxford |website=globaloceancommission.org}}</ref>\n\nDarbishire Quad is described on the opening page of ''[[Gaudy Night]]'' by alumna [[Dorothy L.

Some of the more prominent members of the association were [[George Granville Bradley]], Master of [[University College, Oxford|University College]], [[T. H. Green]], a prominent liberal philosopher and Fellow of [[Balliol College]], and [[Edward Stuart Talbot]], Warden of [[Keble College, Oxford|Keble College]]. Talbot insisted on a specifically [[Anglican]] institution, which was unacceptable to most of the other members. The two parties eventually split, and Talbot's group (the \"[[Christ Church, Oxford|Christ Church]] camp\") founded [[Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford|Lady Margaret Hall]], which opened its doors for students in 1879, the same year as Somerville did.{{sfn |Brockliss |2016 |p=374}}\n\nThus, in 1879, a second committee was formed to create a college \"in which no distinction will be made between students on the ground of their belonging to different religious denominations.\"{{efn|Originally LMH only admitted students who were practicing members of the [[Church of England]].{{sfn |Brockliss |2016 |p=374}}}}{{sfn |Batson |2008 |pp=22-23}} This committee was called the \"[[Balliol College, Oxford|Balliol]] camp\" and had close ties to the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]].{{sfn |Batson |2008 |p=21}}{{sfn |Adams |1996 |p=11}} This second committee included [[Sir Arthur Dyke Acland, 13th Baronet|A.

G. Vernon Harcourt]] and [[Mary Augusta Ward|Mary Ward]].{{sfn |Adams |1996 |p=11}} Other people who assisted in the founding were [[Anna Swanwick]] and [[Owen Roberts (educator)|Owen Roberts]].\n\nThis new effort resulted in the founding of ''Somerville Hall'', named after the then recently deceased Scottish mathematician and renowned scientific writer [[Mary Somerville]].{{sfn |Brockliss |2016 |p=374}} It was felt that the name would reflect the virtues of liberalism and academic success which the college wished to embody.{{sfn |Batson |2008 |p=23}} She was admired by the founders of the college as a scholar, as well as for her religious and political views, including her conviction that women should have equality in terms of suffrage and access to education.\n\n[[Madeleine Shaw-Lefevre]] was chosen as the first principal because, although not a well-known academic at the time, her background was felt to reflect the college's political stance.{{sfn |Batson |2008 |p=24}} Because of its status as both women's college and non-denominational institution, Somerville was widely regarded within Oxford as \"an eccentric and somewhat alarming institution.\"{{sfn |Batson |2008 |p=25}}\n\n[[File:Thomas Phillips - Mary Fairfax, Mrs William Somerville, 1780 - 1872.

Somerville appointed its first in-house tutor in 1892 and, by the end of the 1890s, female students were permitted to attend lectures in almost all colleges.{{sfn |Brockliss |2016 |p=375; 418}} In 1891 it became the first women's hall to introduce entrance exams and in 1894 the first of the five women's halls of residence to adopt the title of college (changing its name to Somerville College),{{sfn |Adams |1996 |p=47}} the first of them to appoint its own teaching staff, and the first to build [[Somerville College Library|a library]].{{sfn |Manuel |2013 |p=9}} In Oxford legend it soon became known as the \"[[bluestocking]] college\", its excellent examination results refuting the widespread belief that women were incapable of high academic achievement.{{sfn |Manuel |2013 |p=9}}\n\nIn the 1910s, Somerville became known for its support for the [[Women's suffrage in the United Kingdom|women's suffrage]] campaign.{{sfn |Adams |1996 |p=78}} In 1920, Oxford University allowed women to matriculate and therefore gain degrees.{{sfn |Batson |2008 |p=xv}} From the college's inception, all female students had to be chaperoned when in the presence of male students. The practice was abolished in 1925, although male visitors to the college were still subject to a curfew.{{sfn |Adams |1996 |p=215}} In the same year the college was granted its charter.\n\n===First World War===\nDuring the [[World War I|First World War]], Somerville College together with the [[Examination Schools]] and other Oxford buildings were requisitioned by the [[War Office]] to create the Third Southern General Hospital, a facility for the [[Royal Army Medical Corps]] to treat military casualties.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordhistory.org.uk/war/military_hospitals/|title=Military Hospitals|publisher=Oxford History|accessdate=22 July 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.some.ox.ac.uk/about-somerville/history/somerville-hospital-then-and-now/ |title=Somerville Hospital \u2013 Then and Now |access-date=27 August 2018 |publisher=Somerville College}}</ref> For the duration of the war, Somerville students relocated to [[Oriel College, Oxford|Oriel College]].{{sfn |Adams |1996 |p=78}} Because many male students had left Oxford to enlist in the military, Somerville was able to rent [[St Mary Hall, Oxford|St Mary Hall Quad]] which they bricked off from the rest of the college to segregate it from Oriel's remaining male students.{{sfn |Adams |1996 |p=89}} Many students and tutors were involved in work in World War I and some of them went to the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] in [[France]].\n\nNotable patients who stayed in Somerville include [[Robert Graves]] and [[Siegfried Sassoon]]. Sassoon arrived on 2 August 1916. Graves and Sassoon were both to reminisce of their time at Somerville Hospital: ''How unlike you to crib my idea of going to the Ladies' College at Oxford'', Sassoon wrote to Graves in 1917, and called it ''very much like Paradise''.<ref>{{cite book |last=Sassoon |first=Siegfried |authorlink=Siegfried Sassoon |date=1945 |title=Siegfried's Journey, 1916-1920 |page=5}}</ref> At Somerville College, Graves met his first love, a nurse and professional pianist called Marjorie.

Somerville remained a women's college until 1992, when its statutes were amended to permit male students and fellows; the first male fellows were appointed in 1993, and the first male students admitted in 1994.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/higher-education-blue-stockings-greet-blue-socks-somerville-college-oxford-is-preparing-to-admit-its-1505082.html |title=Higher Education: Blue stockings greet blue socks: Somerville College Oxford is preparing to admit its first men next year |first=Stephen |last=Pritchard |date=18 November 1993 |newspaper=[[The Independent]]}}</ref> Somerville became the second-to-last college (after [[St Hilda's College, Oxford|St Hilda's]]) to become coeducational.{{sfn |Brockliss |2016 |p=573}} A 50 per cent male/female gender balance has been maintained to this day, though without formal quotas.<ref name=laddism>[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2015/may/15/sexist-laddism-abuse-somerville-college-oxford How we are fighting sexist laddism and abuse at Somerville College, Oxford], Alice Prochaska, ''[[The Guardian]]'', 15 May 2015</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://public.tableau.com/views/UniversityofOxford-StudentStatistics/CollegeBreakdown?%3Aembed=y&%3Adisplay_count=yes&%3AshowTabs=y&%3AshowVizHome=no#3 |title=Student Statistics - Sex |publisher=University of Oxford |date=2017 |access-date=10 September 2018}}</ref>\n\n{{Quote|text=In the 1890s Somerville helped fashion the \"New Woman\"; a century later... the college has set itself the perhaps greater challenge of educating the \"New Man.\" |author=Pauline Adams, ''Somerville for Women'' (1996){{sfn |Adams |1996 |p=363}}}}\n\n==Buildings and grounds==\n[[File:Somerville College, Oxford - House.JPG|thumb|right|House seen from the Quad]]\nThe college and its main entrance, the Porters' Lodge, are located at the southern end of [[Woodstock Road, Oxford|Woodstock Road]], with [[Little Clarendon Street]] to the south, [[Walton Street]] to the west and the [[Radcliffe Observatory Quarter]] to the north.

The building was designed by [[Harry Wilkinson Moore]] and built in two stages. The 1885\u20131887 phase saw the construction of rooms for 18 students with their own dining-room, sitting rooms and vice-principal. This was a deliberate policy aimed at replicating the family environment that the women students had left.{{sfn |Manuel |2013 |p=11}} This arrangement had the effect of turning House and West into rivals.{{sfn |Manuel |2013 |p=12}} The second building stage (1888\u20131895) created two sets of tutors' rooms, a further 19 rooms and the West Lodge (now Park Lodge).<ref name=\"british-history.ac.uk\"/> In 2004 it was renamed Park in honour of [[Daphne Park]], the principal from 1980 to 1989.{{sfn |Manuel |2013 |p=12}}\n\nToday there are over 60 student and fellows' rooms within the building, as well as a music room and a computer room.

Specially for this opening, ''Demeter'' was written by [[Robert Bridges]] and performed for the first time. Somerville Library was the first purpose-built library in the women's colleges of the university. With some foresight it was deisgned to contain 60,000 volumes, although the college only possessed 6,000 when it was opened. It now holds around 120,000 items (95,000 on open shelves), making it one of the largest college libraries in the university.{{sfn |Manuel |2013 |p=16}}\n\n[[Amelia Edwards]], [[John Stuart Mill]], [[John Ruskin]] and [[Vera Brittain]] have been notable benefactors to the library.{{sfn |Manuel |2013 |p=16}} The library contains paintings by Mary Somerville, [[John Constable]], [[Maud Sumner]] and [[Patrick George]].<ref name=artuk />\n\nThe John Stuart Mill room contains what was Mill's personal library in London at the time of his death, with significant annotations in many of the books.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.some.ox.ac.uk/library-it/special-collections/john-stuart-mill-collection/ |title=John Stuart Mill Collection \u2013 Somerville College Oxford |publisher=University of Oxford |access-date=8 June 2016}}</ref>\n\nThe library dominates the north wing of the main quadrangle (having been designed to bring the college together) and is open 24 hours, with access to college-wide wifi, a group study room, and computing and printing facilities.

A. L. Fisher]], the Vice-Chancellor of the University and [[Gilbert Murray]].{{sfn|Manuel|2013|p=22}} Murray, whose translations of Greek drama were performed at Somerville in 1912 and 1946, supported Somerville in many ways, including endowing its first research fellowship. A fund was raised as a memorial to [[Agnes Catherine Maitland|Miss Maitland]], the principal of Somerville Hall (College from 1894) from 1889 to 1906, and this money was used to pay for the oak panelling in Hall. The panelling of the south wall was specially designed to frame the portrait of [[Mary Somerville]] by [[John Jackson (painter)|John Jackson]].{{sfn |Manuel |2013 |p=19}} The buildings were constructed on the site of an adjoining building gifted to Somerville by E.

In 1935, [[Percy Richard Morley Horder|Morley Horder]] reconstructed the archway which connected Maitland Hall and the south wing of Walton House, creating the Reading Room off the main hall and, in 1947, [[Andr\u00e9 Gide]] gave a lecture which filled not only both of these rooms, but the staircase and the quadrangle outside.{{sfn |Manuel |2013 |p=22}}\n\nSomerville's dining hall is the only Oxford dining hall where all the portraits show women.

In 1920, three houses (29, 31 and 33) were purchased by the college from the vicar of [[St Giles' Church, Oxford]], for the sum of \u00a31,300. The three properties were constructed in 1859 and had been rented by the college prior to their purchase. The adjoining ''Waggon and Horses'' was purchased from [[St John's College, Oxford]], in 1923. These buildings were demolished between 1932 and 1933 together with the old Gate House.\n\n[[Percy Richard Morley Horder|Morley Horder]] was commissioned to build a quadrangle which would fill the space left by the demolished structures, using a loan of \u00a312,000 from [[Christ Church, Oxford|Christ Church]]. The porters' lodge and a New Council Room were constructed at the entrance to the quad, which housed undergraduates and fellows.<ref name=\"british-history.ac.uk\"/> The coat of arms of Somerville and those of co-founder [[John Percival (bishop)|John Percival]], first principal [[Madeleine Shaw-Lefevre]] and Helen Darbishire were carved by Edmund Ware inside the quadrangle. The archway leading to Hall was reconstructed in 1938.\n\nOriginally this was called the East Quadrangle. It was opened in June 1934 by [[Edward Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax|Lord Halifax]], who called it \"a notable addition to buildings of varying styles\" (''varii generis aedificiia additamentum nobile'') in the [[Creweian Oration]] during the [[Encaenia]]. Darbishire was renamed in 1962 in honour of the principal of the college during its construction, [[Helen Darbishire]].{{sfn |Manuel |2013 |p=26}}\n\nToday Darbishire contains some 50 student rooms, along with tutors' offices, the college archive and a medical room.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> The offices of the [[Global Ocean Commission]], co-chaired by [[Jos\u00e9 Mar\u00eda Figueres]], [[Trevor Manuel]] and [[David Miliband]], were situated in Darbishire as part of a partnership with Somerville from 2012 to 2016, when the organisation completed its work.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.globaloceancommission.org/about-the-commission/contact/ |title=contact \u2013 Somerville College Oxford |website=globaloceancommission.org}}</ref>\n\nDarbishire Quad is described on the opening page of ''[[Gaudy Night]]'' by alumna [[Dorothy L.

The models in the H100 series differ mainly in [[hard drive]] storage capacity.  The players were succeeded by the [[iriver H300 series]].\n\n==Features==\n*Plays [[MP3]], [[Ogg Vorbis]], [[WAV]] and [[Windows Media Audio|WMA]] (non-[[Digital Rights Management|DRM]]) [[Audio format|format]] files\n*[[Analog signal|Analog]] and [[Digital data|digital]] [[Optical fiber|optical]] [[Line level|line]] in and out\n*Records from line in (analogue or optical), built-in or external [[microphone]] to WAV or MP3 format (supports [[Phantom power|powered]] or unpowered external microphones)\n*Built-in stereo [[FM radio]] [[Tuner (radio)|tuner]]\n*160&times;128 [[pixel]] [[greyscale]] [[LCD]] (4 shades of grey)\n*Wired [[Remote control|remote]] with 128\u00d764 pixel [[greyscale|black and white]] LCD, which can control any function of the DAP (same as iMP-550)\n*Built-in 1300 [[Milliampere-hour|mA\u00b7h]] [[Lithium ion polymer battery|Li-polymer]]  [[Battery (electricity)|battery]], advertised 16 hours playback time\n*[[USB]] 2.0, supports [[USB Mass Storage]] ([[drag and drop]] music transfers)\n*Upgradeable [[firmware]]\n*[[Motorola Coldfire]] [[Central processing unit|CPU]] at 120 [[MHz]] [http://www.rockbox.org/twiki/bin/view/Main/IriverHardwareComponents]\n* 16 [[Megabyte|MB]] RAM (H110, H115) or 32 MB RAM (H120, H140)\n\n==Upgrades==\n===Firmware===\nIt is possible to upgrade the [[firmware]] on H100 series players. These upgrades generally contain [[Software bug|bug]] fixes and new features. The latest official version of the H100 series firmware was <small>v</small>1.66.\n\n===Hard drive===\nThe H100 series is equipped with a 1.8&nbsp;inch (45&nbsp;mm) [[Hard disk drive#Form factors|form factor]] hard drive manufactured by [[Toshiba]]. Storage density has increased since their introduction, making it possible for users to replace the factory drives with higher capacity aftermarket models. Opening the case of the player voids the warranty. However, after the case has been opened the upgrade consists of simply unplugging the old drive and inserting the new one.\n\nAs of December 2005, the H120 can be upgraded with a 30GB single-platter drive (giving a 50% storage increase) and the H140 can be upgraded with an 60GB double-platter drive (giving a 50% storage increase). Due to differing physical sizes, the two drive types cannot be used interchangeably (i.e. a double-platter drive will not fit in an H120 casing).\n\nAs of 2008 The H140 can be upgraded using a [[Zero Insertion Force|ZIF]] to [[Parallel ATA|ATA]] conversion cable to take a larger capacity 1.8&nbsp;inch non ata hard disk drive. The 240GB MK2431GAH ZIF drive has been used in the H140 and the 160GB MK1634GAL ZIF drive has been used in the H120.\n\nAs of 2012, the H120 can be upgraded to a 120GB SSD drive using a 50Pin Series 1.8\" CF ATA SSD.\n\nAs of 2018, the H120 can be upgraded to a 128gb Micro SD drive using a 1.8\" IDE to SD adaptor.<ref>http://forums.rockbox.org/index.php?topic=51939.0</ref>\n\n===Battery===\nThe battery used in the H100 series is physically similar to the battery used in [[iPod]]s and other DAPs. It is possible to replace the factory battery with a higher capacity one (up to 2200 mA\u00b7h has been reported) for greatly increased playback time. In some instances the [[Electrical polarity|polarity]] of the battery leads must be reversed, and the installation process will void the warranty.\n\n===RTC (Real-time clock)===\nUsers have succeeded in adding an [[Real-time clock|RTC]] chip to the player's main circuit board, allowing the device to display the current date and time as well as adding alarm clock functionality, accurate filesystem timestamping and last.fm logging.
