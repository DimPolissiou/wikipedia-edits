A total of 94 students of the primary section of the Krishna English Medium School were burnt to death in their classroom as the thatched roof caught fire on 16 July 2004.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://in.rediff.com/news/2004/jul/16tn.htm |title=83 children killed in school fire in Kumbakonam |publisher=Rediff.com|date=17 July 2004|accessdate=30 November 2013 }}</ref>\n<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.hindu.com/2004/07/17/stories/2004071707570100.htm|newspaper=The Hindu|title=87 children die in school fire|date=17 July 2004|accessdate=30 November 2013 }}</ref> The accident was one of the four largest fire accidents and the largest school accident in Tamil Nadu's history, as well as the second largest school fire in India in terms of casualties.\n\nA committee set up under the retired Judge Sampath found out that the heavy casualties were due to the wrong tactics of the management to admit extra students to a primary school and mislead the authorities about the student-teacher ratio. The Chief Minister who visited the site ordered the withdrawal of the recognition of the three schools, prosecution of the school authorities and the correspondent, and the suspension of the Chief Educational Officer, the District Elementary Educational Officer, and the Assistant Elementary Educational Officer of the Thanjavur school district. A compensation of {{INR}} 1,000,000 was provided to the next of the kin of the deads, {{INR}} 25,000 to the severely injured, and {{INR}} 10,000 to other injured victims from the Chief Minister\u2019s Public Relief Fund. The district administration arranged another primary school in Natham village and accommodated 46 students under the Educational Guarantee Scheme of the government.\n\nThe state government constructed a memorial park near Palakarai, Kumbakonam in memory of the lost lives, opening on 6 June 2010. The government also allotted housing plots to 59 homeless parents of 89 deceased students.\n\nAfter a long delay, a trial began on 24 September 2012 in the Thanjavur district court. The case had 21 accused people and had 488 witnesses that included 18 children who survived the accident. The headmaster Prabharan and three others were charged. Charges were also filed against 17 others, including Pulavar Palanichamy, his wife and correspondent of the school Saraswati, three teachers, six officers of the Elementary Education Department, the Kumbakonam municipal commissioner, the town planning officer, and four assistants of the education department. On 30 July 2014, the court sentenced school founder Pulavar Palanichamy to life imprisonment and fined {{INR}} 51,65,700. Ten others, including school staff and officials from Kumbakonam and state education department, were sentenced to five years imprisonment. Eleven of those accused, including three teachers, were acquitted.\n\n==Background==\nThere were three schools namely, Sri Krishna Aided Primary School, Saraswathy Nursery and Primary School and Sri Krishna Girls High School, operating in the same building in Kasiraman street in Kumbakonam in the South Indian state of Tamil Nadu. The school was located amidst residential buildings, {{convert|15|m|ft|abbr=on}} away from the main road.<ref name=\"report103\">[[#report|Inquiry Commission report 2005]], p. 103</ref> The school had a small gate {{convert|4|ft|m|abbr=on}} wide, immediately beyond which the classrooms were located. The classrooms did not have any partition and at the end of the classrooms, there was a stage. On the northwest side of the stage was the noon meal kitchen and a cycle stand, both of which were thatched structures.<ref name=\"report107\">[[#report|Inquiry Commission report 2005]], p. 107</ref> The northern wing in the ground floor accommodated the Saraswathy Nursery and Primary School, which had six classes, one each for LKG, UKG, I, II, IV and V. There was another entrance to the school on the eastern side. \n\nThe buildings in the nursery and primary schools had no ventilation. Near the eastern entrance, there was a narrow staircase {{convert|4.5|ft|m|abbr=on}} wide leading to the first floor of the building. The layout of the first floor was similar to the ground floor where classes had no separation and exit was through a narrow collapsible door. The lower end of the class on the western side was connected to the noon meal kitchen thatched roof and the cycle stand roof, where the accident occurred. The Sri Krishna Girls High School had 179, Sri Krishna Aided Primary School had 477 and Saraswathy Nursery and Primary School had 126 students in its roles, totalling to 782 students. The second floor measured {{convert|62.5|ft|m|abbr=on}} * {{convert|13|ft|m|abbr=on}} and had classes for standards VI, VII, VIII and IX of the girls high school. The third floor had an open terrace having a water tank.<ref name=\"report111\">[[#report|Inquiry Commission report 2005]], p. 111-114</ref>\n\n==Accident==\nOn 16 July 2004, the fire tragedy occurred on thatched roof structure of the school. The school started at 9:15&nbsp;a.m. and during one of the breaks at 10:30&nbsp;a.m., one of the girls noticed the fire and alerted the teacher and the news spread to other classes.<ref name=\"report115\">[[#report|Inquiry Commission report 2005]], p. 115</ref> The fire sparked from the midday meal kitchen thatch and spread to the upper level, which also had thatched roofs and spread rapidly. The narrow staircase had sundry material, that prevented the exit of children. The staircase was also located close to the kitchen. The kitchen did not have gas stoves and fire logs were used for cooking. The school was overcrowded, having 900 children enrolled.<ref name=\"report115\"/><ref name=\"Teets103\">[[#Teets|Teets 2007]], p. 103-4</ref><ref>[[#Ramaswamy|Ramaswamy 2007]], p. 67</ref> The thatches and the supporting bamboo poles caught fire and fell on the children and also blocked the exit. \n\nThe fire service was informed at 11 a.m. and the personnel arrived in a few minutes. But since they were unprepared for such a large scale fire, the rescue services were not effective. The locals also helped by breaking the concrete window.<ref name=\"report115\" /> The injured children were admitted to the government hospital in Kumbakonam and some of them later got shifted to Thanjavur Medical College hospital. \n\n=== Victims ===\nThe deceased children were taken to the government hospital for postmortem. By the end of the day, 76 children were reported deceased and the district administration had handed over the bodies to the parents. The Collector of the district arranged for temporary wards in the government hospital for the parents to identify their children. The digging of graves went on until 2 a.m. The next morning with the help of additional diggers arranged by the district administration, that day 56 bodies were buried. \n\nOn 16 July, additional doctors arrived from [[Kilpauk Medical College]], JIPMER Medical College Hospital, C.M.C., [[Vellore]], [[Salem, Tamil Nadu|Salem]] and [[Coimbatore]] to treat the injured. The casualty numbers increased to 90, 89 of whom were identified and handed over to the parents. Some of the injured were shifted to private hospitals in [[Kumbakonam]], [[Madurai]] and [[Chennai]] as requested by parents. There were 65 who were still undergoing treatment on 16 July, although 4 of whom later died, making the total death toll rise to 94.<ref name=\"report116\" />\n\n==Investigation==\nThe state government deputed a committee under Justice K. Sampath to inquire into the circumstances and causes of the fire accident on 20 July 2004. The committee assumed office on 1 August 2004 and was constituted with expert members Dr Rani Kandhaswami (Former Principal, Lady Willington Institute of Advanced Studies in Education, Chennai), S.K. Saxena (Fire Officer, Madras Atomic Power Station, Kalpakkam), K. Vijayan (Clinical Psychologist, Institute of Mental Health, Chennai) and P.A. Annamalai (retired Head Master).<ref name=\"report1\">[[#report|Inquiry Commission report 2005]], pp. 1-2</ref>\n\nThe committee was given a timeline of four months but extended for four times and it could finally complete the investigation on 30th June 2005.\nThe investigations found out that the school was not inspected by the educational official for three years. The fire officials reported that the building laws were not followed as the school had a thatched kitchen and classroom roof, had no emergency exits and it was a \"death trap\".<ref name=\"Walsh51\">[[#Walsh|Walsh 2011]], pp. 51-52</ref><ref>[[#Banerjee|Banerjee 2006]], p. 298</ref> The schools have to follow minimum safety standards, the chapter IV on fire and safety of National Building Code of India 2005 and 14435:1997 states the code of practice of fire safety in educational institutions.<ref>[[#Walsh|Walsh 2011]], p. 57</ref> A public interest litigation was filed in the [[Supreme Court of India]] by Avinash Mehrotra quoting the accident and pleading protection of life and safety of school children across various other schools in India.<ref name=\"Walsh51\"/><ref>{{cite web|title=Avinash Mehrotra vs Union Of India & Ors. on 13 April, 2009|url=http://indiankanoon.org/doc/232115/|publisher=Indian Kanoon|last=D.|first=Bhandari|date=13 April 2009|accessdate=30 November 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe school teachers were not trained properly to handle the situation. The investigation revealed that the role of teachers was highly questionable. One view held that most of them found ways to escape themselves rather than saving the children as many came out unscathed. Some of the student eyewitnesses revealed that the teachers asked them to remain in the classes. However, some hold that the teachers tried their best to rescue the children and some of them asked the children to stay in the classes as they thought the fire was just the regular smoke from the kitchen.<ref name=\"Teets103\"/><ref name=\"report116\"/>\n\n[[File:Kumbakonam fire accident 1.jpg|thumb|Kumbakonam school fire|thumb|Kumbakonam school fire memorial located near Kaveri bridge|300px|left]]\nThe committee found that the major reason for the heavy casualty was the false tactics of the management to bring the other two school students to the aided primary school to mislead the inspecting authorities about the student-teacher ratio. The management was held responsible for the whole accident. The report pointed out that the teachers were not trained in disaster management and the prohibited thatch structure was close to the classrooms. It also stated that the schools had inadequate exit facilities and had no firefighting capabilities. Pulavar Palanichamy, the owner of the schools, was reported to have used his political clout and coalesced with the municipal and the revenue department officials getting the permits for the schools. Vijayalakshmi, the noon meal organizer and teacher of the English Medium School, was held accountable for not performing her duties of taking safety precautions. \n\nVasanthi, the head cook lit the oven in the absence of her assistant, Sivasankari, who usually lights it. There were contrasting reports on whether Sivasankari was present in the school during the event. The Tahsildar of Kumbakonam Taluk, Paramasivam, was reported \"dishonest\" for granting a license under the Tamil Nadu Public Buildings (Licensing) Act, 1965 to the school. The chartered engineer Jayachandran was also held dishonest of giving stability certificate to the building without visiting the school once. The additional assistant educational officer, Madhavan for allowing the school to run without recognition for 6 years. Sivaprakasam, the assistant elementary education officer, was held accountable for allowing Madhavan, who was not competent to allow a permit to the school. Balaji, the deputy education elementary officer was accused of carelessly passing the papers signed by Madhavan. The local health officer Dr Sivapunyam was accused of giving false sanitary certificate to the school. Annadurai, a friend of Pulavar Palanichamy was accounted for advising circumvention of rules. Pingapani, the deputy educational officer, who inspected the high school, did not show interest in learning that the same campus had a primary school acting beyond rules. The other officers who were earlier responsible for permitting the nursery school against the rules during 1999, namely, Shanmughavelu, Sethuramachandran, Chandrasekharan and Dr.Palanivelu. The Deputy elementary educational officer, Durairaj and assistant elementary educational officer, Balakrishnan, were held less culpable for knowing about the thatched structure and the exaggerated attendance, but not initiating any action.<ref name=\"report133\">[[#report|Inquiry Commission report 2005]], p. 133-138</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\n{{quote box\n| border=2px\n| align=right\n| bgcolor = Cornsilk\n| font = Times\n|width  = 30%\n| title=<u>Prayer for departed children of Kumbakonam</u>\n| halign=center\n| quote=<poem>\n\"Oh dear little ones!

The Chief Minister who visited the site ordered the withdrawal of the recognition of the three schools, prosecution of the school authorities and the correspondent, and the suspension of the Chief Educational Officer, the District Elementary Educational Officer, and the Assistant Elementary Educational Officer of the Thanjavur school district. A compensation of {{INR}} 1,000,000 was provided to the next of the kin of the deads, {{INR}} 25,000 to the severely injured, and {{INR}} 10,000 to other injured victims from the Chief Minister\u2019s Public Relief Fund. The district administration arranged another primary school in Natham village and accommodated 46 students under the Educational Guarantee Scheme of the government.\n\nThe state government constructed a memorial park near Palakarai, Kumbakonam in memory of the lost lives, opening on 6 June 2010. The government also allotted housing plots to 59 homeless parents of 89 deceased students.\n\nAfter a long delay, a trial began on 24 September 2012 in the Thanjavur district court. The case had 21 accused people and had 488 witnesses that included 18 children who survived the accident. The headmaster Prabharan and three others were charged. Charges were also filed against 17 others, including Pulavar Palanichamy, his wife and correspondent of the school Saraswati, three teachers, six officers of the Elementary Education Department, the Kumbakonam municipal commissioner, the town planning officer, and four assistants of the education department. On 30 July 2014, the court sentenced school founder Pulavar Palanichamy to life imprisonment and fined {{INR}} 51,65,700. Ten others, including school staff and officials from Kumbakonam and state education department, were sentenced to five years imprisonment. Eleven of those accused, including three teachers, were acquitted.\n\n==Background==\nThere were three schools namely, Sri Krishna Aided Primary School, Saraswathy Nursery and Primary School and Sri Krishna Girls High School, operating in the same building in Kasiraman street in Kumbakonam in the South Indian state of Tamil Nadu. The school was located amidst residential buildings, {{convert|15|m|ft|abbr=on}} away from the main road.<ref name=\"report103\">[[#report|Inquiry Commission report 2005]], p. 103</ref> The school had a small gate {{convert|4|ft|m|abbr=on}} wide, immediately beyond which the classrooms were located. The classrooms did not have any partition and at the end of the classrooms, there was a stage. On the northwest side of the stage was the noon meal kitchen and a cycle stand, both of which were thatched structures.<ref name=\"report107\">[[#report|Inquiry Commission report 2005]], p. 107</ref> The northern wing in the ground floor accommodated the Saraswathy Nursery and Primary School, which had six classes, one each for LKG, UKG, I, II, IV and V. There was another entrance to the school on the eastern side. \n\nThe buildings in the nursery and primary schools had no ventilation. Near the eastern entrance, there was a narrow staircase {{convert|4.5|ft|m|abbr=on}} wide leading to the first floor of the building. The layout of the first floor was similar to the ground floor where classes had no separation and exit was through a narrow collapsible door. The lower end of the class on the western side was connected to the noon meal kitchen thatched roof and the cycle stand roof, where the accident occurred. The Sri Krishna Girls High School had 179, Sri Krishna Aided Primary School had 477 and Saraswathy Nursery and Primary School had 126 students in its roles, totalling to 782 students. The second floor measured {{convert|62.5|ft|m|abbr=on}} * {{convert|13|ft|m|abbr=on}} and had classes for standards VI, VII, VIII and IX of the girls high school. The third floor had an open terrace having a water tank.<ref name=\"report111\">[[#report|Inquiry Commission report 2005]], p. 111-114</ref>\n\n==Accident==\nOn 16 July 2004, the fire tragedy occurred on thatched roof structure of the school. The school started at 9:15&nbsp;a.m. and during one of the breaks at 10:30&nbsp;a.m., one of the girls noticed the fire and alerted the teacher and the news spread to other classes.<ref name=\"report115\">[[#report|Inquiry Commission report 2005]], p. 115</ref> The fire sparked from the midday meal kitchen thatch and spread to the upper level, which also had thatched roofs and spread rapidly. The narrow staircase had sundry material, that prevented the exit of children. The staircase was also located close to the kitchen. The kitchen did not have gas stoves and fire logs were used for cooking. The school was overcrowded, having 900 children enrolled.<ref name=\"report115\"/><ref name=\"Teets103\">[[#Teets|Teets 2007]], p. 103-4</ref><ref>[[#Ramaswamy|Ramaswamy 2007]], p. 67</ref> The thatches and the supporting bamboo poles caught fire and fell on the children and also blocked the exit. \n\nThe fire service was informed at 11 a.m. and the personnel arrived in a few minutes. But since they were unprepared for such a large scale fire, the rescue services were not effective. The locals also helped by breaking the concrete window.<ref name=\"report115\" /> The injured children were admitted to the government hospital in Kumbakonam and some of them later got shifted to Thanjavur Medical College hospital. \n\n=== Victims ===\nThe deceased children were taken to the government hospital for postmortem. By the end of the day, 76 children were reported deceased and the district administration had handed over the bodies to the parents. The Collector of the district arranged for temporary wards in the government hospital for the parents to identify their children. The digging of graves went on until 2 a.m. The next morning with the help of additional diggers arranged by the district administration, that day 56 bodies were buried. \n\nOn 16 July, additional doctors arrived from [[Kilpauk Medical College]], JIPMER Medical College Hospital, C.M.C., [[Vellore]], [[Salem, Tamil Nadu|Salem]] and [[Coimbatore]] to treat the injured. The casualty numbers increased to 90, 89 of whom were identified and handed over to the parents. Some of the injured were shifted to private hospitals in [[Kumbakonam]], [[Madurai]] and [[Chennai]] as requested by parents. There were 65 who were still undergoing treatment on 16 July, although 4 of whom later died, making the total death toll rise to 94.<ref name=\"report116\" />\n\n==Investigation==\nThe state government deputed a committee under Justice K. Sampath to inquire into the circumstances and causes of the fire accident on 20 July 2004. The committee assumed office on 1 August 2004 and was constituted with expert members Dr Rani Kandhaswami (Former Principal, Lady Willington Institute of Advanced Studies in Education, Chennai), S.K. Saxena (Fire Officer, Madras Atomic Power Station, Kalpakkam), K. Vijayan (Clinical Psychologist, Institute of Mental Health, Chennai) and P.A. Annamalai (retired Head Master).<ref name=\"report1\">[[#report|Inquiry Commission report 2005]], pp. 1-2</ref>\n\nThe committee was given a timeline of four months but extended for four times and it could finally complete the investigation on 30th June 2005.\nThe investigations found out that the school was not inspected by the educational official for three years. The fire officials reported that the building laws were not followed as the school had a thatched kitchen and classroom roof, had no emergency exits and it was a \"death trap\".<ref name=\"Walsh51\">[[#Walsh|Walsh 2011]], pp. 51-52</ref><ref>[[#Banerjee|Banerjee 2006]], p. 298</ref> The schools have to follow minimum safety standards, the chapter IV on fire and safety of National Building Code of India 2005 and 14435:1997 states the code of practice of fire safety in educational institutions.<ref>[[#Walsh|Walsh 2011]], p. 57</ref> A public interest litigation was filed in the [[Supreme Court of India]] by Avinash Mehrotra quoting the accident and pleading protection of life and safety of school children across various other schools in India.<ref name=\"Walsh51\"/><ref>{{cite web|title=Avinash Mehrotra vs Union Of India & Ors. on 13 April, 2009|url=http://indiankanoon.org/doc/232115/|publisher=Indian Kanoon|last=D.|first=Bhandari|date=13 April 2009|accessdate=30 November 2013}}</ref>\n\nThe school teachers were not trained properly to handle the situation. The investigation revealed that the role of teachers was highly questionable. One view held that most of them found ways to escape themselves rather than saving the children as many came out unscathed. Some of the student eyewitnesses revealed that the teachers asked them to remain in the classes. However, some hold that the teachers tried their best to rescue the children and some of them asked the children to stay in the classes as they thought the fire was just the regular smoke from the kitchen.<ref name=\"Teets103\"/><ref name=\"report116\"/>\n\n[[File:Kumbakonam fire accident 1.jpg|thumb|Kumbakonam school fire|thumb|Kumbakonam school fire memorial located near Kaveri bridge|300px|left]]\nThe committee found that the major reason for the heavy casualty was the false tactics of the management to bring the other two school students to the aided primary school to mislead the inspecting authorities about the student-teacher ratio. The management was held responsible for the whole accident. The report pointed out that the teachers were not trained in disaster management and the prohibited thatch structure was close to the classrooms. It also stated that the schools had inadequate exit facilities and had no firefighting capabilities. Pulavar Palanichamy, the owner of the schools, was reported to have used his political clout and coalesced with the municipal and the revenue department officials getting the permits for the schools. Vijayalakshmi, the noon meal organizer and teacher of the English Medium School, was held accountable for not performing her duties of taking safety precautions. \n\nVasanthi, the head cook lit the oven in the absence of her assistant, Sivasankari, who usually lights it. There were contrasting reports on whether Sivasankari was present in the school during the event. The Tahsildar of Kumbakonam Taluk, Paramasivam, was reported \"dishonest\" for granting a license under the Tamil Nadu Public Buildings (Licensing) Act, 1965 to the school. The chartered engineer Jayachandran was also held dishonest of giving stability certificate to the building without visiting the school once. The additional assistant educational officer, Madhavan for allowing the school to run without recognition for 6 years. Sivaprakasam, the assistant elementary education officer, was held accountable for allowing Madhavan, who was not competent to allow a permit to the school. Balaji, the deputy education elementary officer was accused of carelessly passing the papers signed by Madhavan. The local health officer Dr Sivapunyam was accused of giving false sanitary certificate to the school. Annadurai, a friend of Pulavar Palanichamy was accounted for advising circumvention of rules. Pingapani, the deputy educational officer, who inspected the high school, did not show interest in learning that the same campus had a primary school acting beyond rules. The other officers who were earlier responsible for permitting the nursery school against the rules during 1999, namely, Shanmughavelu, Sethuramachandran, Chandrasekharan and Dr.Palanivelu. The Deputy elementary educational officer, Durairaj and assistant elementary educational officer, Balakrishnan, were held less culpable for knowing about the thatched structure and the exaggerated attendance, but not initiating any action.<ref name=\"report133\">[[#report|Inquiry Commission report 2005]], p. 133-138</ref>\n\n==Aftermath==\n{{quote box\n| border=2px\n| align=right\n| bgcolor = Cornsilk\n| font = Times\n|width  = 30%\n| title=<u>Prayer for departed children of Kumbakonam</u>\n| halign=center\n| quote=<poem>\n\"Oh dear little ones!

It was originally released in May 1979 by [[RCA Records]]. The third and final release of the [[Berlin Trilogy]], following ''[[Low (David Bowie album)|Low]]'' and ''[[\"Heroes\" (David Bowie album)|\"Heroes\"]]'' (both 1977), it was recorded in Switzerland and [[New York City]] with collaborator [[Brian Eno]] and producer [[Tony Visconti]]. Unlike Bowie's previous two albums, ''Lodger'' contained no instrumentals and a somewhat more pop-oriented style while experimenting with elements of [[world music]] and recording techniques inspired by Eno's [[Oblique Strategies]] cards.<ref name=\"Q\"/>\n\nThe album was not, by Bowie's standards, a major commercial success. Indifferently received by critics on its initial release, it is now widely considered to be among Bowie's most underrated albums.<ref name=\"Strange Fascination\">David Buckley (1999). ''Strange Fascination&nbsp;\u2013 David Bowie: The Definitive Story'': pp.335\u2013356</ref><ref name=\"The Complete David Bowie\">[[Nicholas Pegg]] (2000). ''The Complete David Bowie'': pp.310\u2013312</ref> It was accompanied by several singles, including the UK Top 10 hit \"[[Boys Keep Swinging]]\".\n\nIt is one of Bowie's most influential works, particularly to the 1990s [[Britpop]] movement, with two major Britpop bands, [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]], who named their 1996 number-one hit \"[[Don't Look Back in Anger]]\" after ''Lodger'''s \"[[Look Back in Anger (song)|Look Back in Anger]]\" and [[Blur (band)|Blur]], who used the same chord sequence as \"[[Fantastic Voyage (David Bowie song)|Fantastic Voyage]]\" and \"[[Boys Keep Swinging]]\" in their 1997 hit single \"[[M.O.R.]]\". The album has been reissued multiple times and was remastered in 2017 as part of the ''[[A New Career in a New Town (1977\u20131982)]]'' box set.\n\n==Recording and production==\nOriginally to be titled either ''Planned Accidents'' or ''Despite Straight Lines'',<ref name=\"The Complete David Bowie\"/> ''Lodger'' was largely recorded between legs of David Bowie's [[Isolar II \u2013 The 1978 World Tour|Isolar II Tour]] and featured the same musicians, along with [[Brian Eno]]. The recording sessions saw Bowie and Eno utilize techniques from Eno's [[Oblique Strategies]] cards.<ref name=\"Q\">{{cite web|last1=Graham|first1=Ben|title=30-Years On: David Bowie's Lodger Comes In From The Cold \u2013 Ben Graham, January 11th, 2016 00:35|url=http://thequietus.com/articles/03161-30-years-on-david-bowie-s-lodger-comes-in-from-the-cold|website=[[The Quietus]]|accessdate=6 December 2016}}</ref> Experiments on the album included using old tunes played backwards, employing identical chord sequences for different songs and having the musicians play unfamiliar instruments (as on \"[[Boys Keep Swinging]]\").<ref name=\"Q\"/> Lead guitar was played not by [[Robert Fripp]], as on ''\"Heroes\"'', but by Fripp's future [[King Crimson]] band member, [[Adrian Belew]], whom Bowie had \"poached\" while the guitarist was touring with [[Frank Zappa]]. Much of Belew's work on the album was composited from multiple takes played against backing tracks of which he had no prior knowledge, not even the key.<ref name=\"Strange Fascination\"/>\n\nEno felt that the trilogy had \"petered out\" by ''Lodger'',<ref name=\"MOJO 60 Years of Bowie\">Ian Gittins (2007). \"Art Decade\", ''[[Mojo (magazine)|MOJO]] 60 Years of Bowie'': pp.70\u201373</ref> and Belew also observed Eno's and Bowie's working relationship closing down: \"They didn't quarrel or anything uncivilised like that; they just didn't seem to have the spark that I imagine they might have had during the ''\"Heroes\"'' album.\"<ref name=\"Strange Fascination\"/> An early plan to continue the basic pattern of the previous records with one side of songs and the other instrumentals was dropped, Bowie instead adding lyrics that foreshadowed the more worldly concerns of his next album, ''[[Scary Monsters (And Super Creeps)]]''.<ref name=\"MOJO 60 Years of Bowie\"/>\n\n==Style and themes==\nThough missing the songs/instrumentals split that characterised ''Low'' and ''\"Heroes\"'', ''Lodger'' has been interpreted as dividing roughly into two major themes, that of travel (primarily side one) and critiques of Western civilisation (primarily side two).<ref name=\"Bowie: An Illustrated Record\">[[Roy Carr]] & [[Charles Shaar Murray]] (1981).

It was originally released in May 1979 by [[RCA Records]]. The third and final release of the [[Berlin Trilogy]], following ''[[Low (David Bowie album)|Low]]'' and ''[[\"Heroes\" (David Bowie album)|\"Heroes\"]]'' (both 1977), it was recorded in Switzerland and [[New York City]] with collaborator [[Brian Eno]] and producer [[Tony Visconti]]. Unlike Bowie's previous two albums, ''Lodger'' contained no instrumentals and a somewhat more pop-oriented style while experimenting with elements of [[world music]] and recording techniques inspired by Eno's [[Oblique Strategies]] cards.<ref name=\"Q\"/>\n\nThe album was not, by Bowie's standards, a major commercial success. Indifferently received by critics on its initial release, it is now widely considered to be among Bowie's most underrated albums.<ref name=\"Strange Fascination\">David Buckley (1999). ''Strange Fascination&nbsp;\u2013 David Bowie: The Definitive Story'': pp.335\u2013356</ref><ref name=\"The Complete David Bowie\">[[Nicholas Pegg]] (2000). ''The Complete David Bowie'': pp.310\u2013312</ref> It was accompanied by several singles, including the UK Top 10 hit \"[[Boys Keep Swinging]]\".\n\nIt is one of Bowie's most influential works, particularly to the 1990s [[Britpop]] movement, with two major Britpop bands, [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]], who named their 1996 number-one hit \"[[Don't Look Back in Anger]]\" after ''Lodger'''s \"[[Look Back in Anger (song)|Look Back in Anger]]\" and [[Blur (band)|Blur]], who used the same chord sequence as \"[[Fantastic Voyage (David Bowie song)|Fantastic Voyage]]\" and \"[[Boys Keep Swinging]]\" in their 1997 hit single \"[[M.O.R.]]\". The album has been reissued multiple times and was remastered in 2017 as part of the ''[[A New Career in a New Town (1977\u20131982)]]'' box set.\n\n==Recording and production==\nOriginally to be titled either ''Planned Accidents'' or ''Despite Straight Lines'',<ref name=\"The Complete David Bowie\"/> ''Lodger'' was largely recorded between legs of David Bowie's [[Isolar II \u2013 The 1978 World Tour|Isolar II Tour]] and featured the same musicians, along with [[Brian Eno]]. The recording sessions saw Bowie and Eno utilize techniques from Eno's [[Oblique Strategies]] cards.<ref name=\"Q\">{{cite web|last1=Graham|first1=Ben|title=30-Years On: David Bowie's Lodger Comes In From The Cold \u2013 Ben Graham, January 11th, 2016 00:35|url=http://thequietus.com/articles/03161-30-years-on-david-bowie-s-lodger-comes-in-from-the-cold|website=[[The Quietus]]|accessdate=6 December 2016}}</ref> Experiments on the album included using old tunes played backwards, employing identical chord sequences for different songs and having the musicians play unfamiliar instruments (as on \"[[Boys Keep Swinging]]\").<ref name=\"Q\"/> Lead guitar was played not by [[Robert Fripp]], as on ''\"Heroes\"'', but by Fripp's future [[King Crimson]] band member, [[Adrian Belew]], whom Bowie had \"poached\" while the guitarist was touring with [[Frank Zappa]]. Much of Belew's work on the album was composited from multiple takes played against backing tracks of which he had no prior knowledge, not even the key.<ref name=\"Strange Fascination\"/>\n\nEno felt that the trilogy had \"petered out\" by ''Lodger'',<ref name=\"MOJO 60 Years of Bowie\">Ian Gittins (2007). \"Art Decade\", ''[[Mojo (magazine)|MOJO]] 60 Years of Bowie'': pp.70\u201373</ref> and Belew also observed Eno's and Bowie's working relationship closing down: \"They didn't quarrel or anything uncivilised like that; they just didn't seem to have the spark that I imagine they might have had during the ''\"Heroes\"'' album.\"<ref name=\"Strange Fascination\"/> An early plan to continue the basic pattern of the previous records with one side of songs and the other instrumentals was dropped, Bowie instead adding lyrics that foreshadowed the more worldly concerns of his next album, ''[[Scary Monsters (And Super Creeps)]]''.<ref name=\"MOJO 60 Years of Bowie\"/>\n\n==Style and themes==\nThough missing the songs/instrumentals split that characterised ''Low'' and ''\"Heroes\"'', ''Lodger'' has been interpreted as dividing roughly into two major themes, that of travel (primarily side one) and critiques of Western civilisation (primarily side two).<ref name=\"Bowie: An Illustrated Record\">[[Roy Carr]] & [[Charles Shaar Murray]] (1981). ''Bowie: An Illustrated Record'': pp.102\u2013107</ref><ref name=\"The Complete David Bowie - Songs\">Nicholas Pegg (2000). Op Cit: pp.172\u2013173</ref> The final track on ''\"Heroes\"'', \"[[The Secret Life of Arabia]]\", anticipated the mock-exotic feel of ''Lodger''{{'}}s travel songs. \"African Night Flight\" was a tribute to the music and culture of the [[veld]], inspired by a trip to [[Kenya]] that he took with his then-small son [[Duncan Jones|Zowie]];<ref name=\"Loving the Alien\">Christopher Sandford (1996, 1997). ''Loving the Alien'': pp.177\u2013191</ref> its musical textures have been cited as presaging the popularity of [[world music]], Bowie considering it a forerunner of the sounds developed by Brian Eno and [[David Byrne]] for ''[[My Life in the Bush of Ghosts (album)|My Life in the Bush of Ghosts]]'' (1981).<ref name=\"Strange Fascination\"/><ref name=\"MOJO 60 Years of Bowie\"/> \"Move On\" was lyrically Bowie's ode to his own wanderlust, sonically his earlier classic \"[[All the Young Dudes]]\" played backwards.<ref name=\"Bowie: An Illustrated Record\"/> \"[[Yassassin]]\" was an unlikely [[reggae]] song with a [[Music of Turkey|Turkish]] flavour. \"Red Sails\" was inspired in part by the music of German band [[Neu!]], sharing Neu!'s distinctive \"[[motorik]]\" drum beat;<ref name=\"The Complete David Bowie - Songs\"/> for Bowie, it combined \"a German new music feel\" with \"a contemporary English mercenary-cum-swashbuckling [[Errol Flynn]]\" to produce \"a lovely cross-reference of cultures\".<ref name=\"Strange Fascination\"/> \"Red Sails\" has also be compared with [[Harmonia (band)|Harmonia's]] 1975 track \"Monza (Rauf und Runter)\".<ref>{{cite web|url= https://bowiesongs.wordpress.com/?s=red+sails |title= Pushing Ahead of the Dame |author= col1234 |accessdate= 11 June 2019}}</ref>\n\nOf the album's critiques, \"[[Boys Keep Swinging]]\", the first single, was seen by ''[[NME]]'' editors [[Roy Carr]] and [[Charles Shaar Murray]] partly as a witty riposte to the [[Village People]] but also, combined with its cross-dressing video clip, a comment on ideas of masculinity; musically it was notable for guitarist [[Carlos Alomar]] and drummer [[Dennis Davis]] in the unfamiliar roles of drummer and bass player, respectively.<ref name=\"Bowie: An Illustrated Record\"/> According to [[Tony Visconti]], the song featured the \"exact same chord changes and structure, even the same key\" as \"[[Fantastic Voyage (David Bowie song)|Fantastic Voyage]]\", Bowie's take on the possibility of [[Nuclear warfare|nuclear war]].<ref>Nicholas Pegg (2000). Op Cit: p.74</ref> The second single, \"[[DJ (David Bowie song)|DJ]]\", took a sardonic look at the world of the disc jockey. \"Repetition\", Bowie's exploration of the mind of an [[domestic violence|abusive partner]], was sung in a deliberately unemotional tone that highlighted the lyric and the unnatural slur of the bass guitar.<ref name=\"Bowie: An Illustrated Record\"/> \"Red Money\" added new words to a Bowie/Alomar tune that had originally appeared as \"Sister Midnight\", with lyrics by Bowie and [[Iggy Pop]], on the latter's album ''[[The Idiot (album)|The Idiot]]''.<ref name=\"The Complete David Bowie\"/>\n\n==Packaging==\nBowie collaborated with English pop artist [[Derek Boshier]] on the [[cover art|cover design]]. The original gatefold album sleeve featured a full-length shot of Bowie by photographer [[Brian Duffy (photographer)|Brian Duffy]] as an accident victim, heavily made up with an apparently broken nose. For effect, the image was deliberately of low resolution, taken with a [[Polaroid SX-70|Polaroid SX-70 type camera]]. The inside of the gatefold included pictures of [[Che Guevara]]'s corpse, [[Andrea Mantegna]]'s ''[[Lamentation of Christ (Mantegna)|Lamentation of Christ]]'' and Bowie being readied for the cover photo.<ref name=\"Bowie: An Illustrated Record\"/><ref>[http://www.derekboshier.com/gate/pages/bowie.html Derek Boshier Web Site]</ref> These images were not reproduced in the [[Rykodisc]] CD reissue in 1991.\n\n==Release and critical reception==\n{{Album ratings\n| rev1       = [[AllMusic]]\n| rev1Score  = {{Rating|4.5|5}}<ref name=\"allmusic\">{{cite web|last=Erlewine|first=Stephen Thomas|authorlink=Stephen Thomas Erlewine|title=Lodger \u2013 David Bowie|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/lodger-mw0000251982|website=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=29 March 2016}}</ref>\n| rev2       = ''[[Blender (magazine)|Blender]]''\n| rev2Score  = {{Rating|4|5}}<ref>{{cite journal|title=David Bowie Part 1: The 1960s and '70s|work=[[Blender (magazine)|Blender]]|issue=47|date=May 2006}}</ref>\n| rev3       = ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''\n| rev3Score  = {{Rating|2.5|4}}<ref>{{cite news|last=Kot|first=Greg|authorlink=Greg Kot|title=Bowie's Many Faces Are Profiled On Compact Disc|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1990-06-10/entertainment/9002170173_1_space-oddity-scary-monsters-ziggy-stardust|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|date=10 June 1990|accessdate=14 July 2016}}</ref>\n| rev4       = ''[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]''\n| rev4Score  = {{Rating|2|5}}<ref>{{cite book|chapter=David Bowie|title=[[Encyclopedia of Popular Music|The Encyclopedia of Popular Music]]|last=Larkin|first=Colin|authorlink=Colin Larkin (writer)|publisher=[[Omnibus Press]]|edition=5th concise|year=2011|isbn=0-85712-595-8}}</ref>\n| rev5       = ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]''\n| rev5score  = B+<ref>{{cite journal|last=Robbins|first=Ira|title=Lodger|url=http://www.ew.com/article/1991/11/01/lodger|work=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|date=1 November 1991|accessdate=14 July 2016}}</ref>\n| rev6       = ''[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]''\n| rev6Score  = 8.5/10<ref>{{cite web|last=Powell|first=Mike|title=David Bowie: Lodger|url=http://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21476-lodger/|work=[[Pitchfork (website)|Pitchfork]]|date=22 January 2015|accessdate=22 January 2015}}</ref>\n| rev7       = ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]''\n| rev7Score  = {{Rating|4|5}}<ref>{{cite journal|title=David Bowie: Lodger|work=[[Q (magazine)|Q]]|issue=61|date=October 1991}}</ref>\n| rev8       = ''[[The Rolling Stone Album Guide]]''\n| rev8Score  = {{Rating|5|5}}<ref>{{cite book|chapter=David Bowie|last=Sheffield|first=Rob|authorlink=Rob Sheffield|title=[[The Rolling Stone Album Guide|The New Rolling Stone Album Guide]]|editor1-last=Brackett|editor1-first=Nathan|editor2-last=Hoard|editor2-first=Christian|publisher=[[Simon & Schuster]]|edition=4th|year=2004|pages=[https://archive.org/details/newrollingstonea00brac/page/97 97\u201399]|isbn=0-7432-0169-8}}</ref>\n| rev9       = ''[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]''\n| rev9Score  = {{Rating|4|5}}<ref>{{cite journal|last=Dolan|first=Jon|title=How to Buy: David Bowie|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s5jfV6kXmTEC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA84|work=[[Spin (magazine)|Spin]]|volume=22|issue=7|date=July 2006|accessdate=14 July 2016|page=84}}</ref>\n| rev10      = ''[[The Village Voice]]''\n| rev10Score = A\u2212<ref name=\"CG\">{{cite news|last=Christgau|first=Robert|authorlink=Robert Christgau|title=Christgau's Consumer Guide|url=http://www.robertchristgau.com/xg/cg/cgv7-79.php|work=[[The Village Voice]]|date=30 July 1979|accessdate=18 July 2011}}</ref>\n}}\n''Lodger'' received relatively poor reviews on its original release, ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' calling it \"one of his weakest&nbsp;... scattered, a footnote to ''\"Heroes\"'', an act of marking time\",<ref>{{cite journal|last=Marcus|first=Greil|authorlink=Greil Marcus|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/albumreviews/lodger-19790809|title=Lodger|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=9 August 1979|accessdate=18 July 2011}}</ref> and ''[[Melody Maker]]'' finding it \"slightly faceless\".<ref name=\"The Complete David Bowie\"/> In ''[[Smash Hits]]'' the album was described as sounding like \"a ragbag of rejects from previous styles\" with \"only occasional flashes of genius\".<ref name=\"SmashHits\">{{cite journal|last=Starr|first=Red|title=Albums|journal=[[Smash Hits]]|issue=31 May \u2013 13 June 1979|page=25}}</ref> It was also criticised for having a thinner, muddier mix than Bowie's previous albums.<ref name=\"The Complete David Bowie\"/> [[Robert Christgau]] wrote favourably of the album in ''[[The Village Voice]]''.

GAA|Mayo]]. He lined out at left corner forward.\n\nMark began Dublin's leinster championship defence on the starting 15 and scored 1\u20130 in the process against Longford. He was dropped for Dublins next match against Laois.

Average approval time has been nine days slower for Trump appointees versus Obama's. Ten of 15 Cabinet agencies had no number two, several deputy secretaries were not nominated until after the Administration's 100-day mark, and some had not yet been nominated.<ref>Yourish, Karen, and Gregor Aisch, [https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/07/17/us/politics/trump-appointments.html \"The Top Jobs in Trump\u2019s Administration Are Mostly Vacant: Who\u2019s to Blame?\"], ''New York Times'', July 17, 2017.

The committee is said to be waiting for the administration to nominate individuals to fill two more vacancies at the commission before it holds the hearing, according to Senate aides and people familiar with the process,\" reported the ''Wall Street Journal''.<ref name=\"wsj01\"/>\n\nIn July 2017, the ''New York Times'' assessed the pace and reported that Trump had announced 36 percent of \"leadership positions below the secretary level\" compared with 78 percent by Obama over the same period. Average approval time has been nine days slower for Trump appointees versus Obama's. Ten of 15 Cabinet agencies had no number two, several deputy secretaries were not nominated until after the Administration's 100-day mark, and some had not yet been nominated.<ref>Yourish, Karen, and Gregor Aisch, [https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/07/17/us/politics/trump-appointments.html \"The Top Jobs in Trump\u2019s Administration Are Mostly Vacant: Who\u2019s to Blame?\"], ''New York Times'', July 17, 2017.
