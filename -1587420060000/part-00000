From Hazrat Syedna Abu Bakr Siddiq ra, the forefathers of Hazrat Pir Khaja Habib Ali Shah ra obtained the spiritual education (Tassawuf/Tariqat) and bestowed with Caliphat from their fathers and wali Allah (Sufi Saints)<ref>\"ABDULLAH\" book written by Moulvi Abul Fayaz Mohammed Anwaruddin Siddiqui ra (Anwar), Hyderabad, India</ref>\n{{Infobox person\n| name=Shah Deccan Qutub Kokan Pir Khaja Habib Ali Shah Chisti ul Quadri Naqshbandi\n| image =\n| caption   = \n| othername = Born as Habib Yarkhan Siddiqui  ra \"Habib\" (Pen Name)\n| title     =Shah-i-Deccan, Qutub-i-Konkan\n| birth_date  = Sunday, 20 Jamadi ul Thani 1236H, \n| birth_place = Hyderabad Deccan, India\n| death_date  = Thursday, 6th Dhul Hijjah 1323H, Khanqah Habibia Dockyard Road, Bombay, India, Buried on 10th Dhul Hijjah 1323H after salat Idd Al-Adha at Ahmed Bagh, now known as Katalmandi, Abids,  Hyderabad, Telangana State,  India.\n| \n}}\n\n==Early life==\nThe birth of Hazrat Khwaja Pir Habib Ali Shah ra was allegedly foretold by the Sheikh himself, who remarked that \"his\" son would be born in the home of Nawaab Ahmad Yar Khan ra (Mohi ud dowla IV). At this stage the mother of Khwaja Habib, Amatul Fatima ra was beyond child bearing age, but since the sheikh had spoken, they believed that [[Allah]] willed otherwise.\n\nIn a couplet in Diwan Habib, Hazrat Khaja Habib Ali Shah ra exhibited love for his Sheikh Mohammed Hafiz Ali Shah Khairabadi ra the parental nobility and worldly life.  In his discourses he explained that the love and respect for the Sheikh the spiritual master.\n\n'''''\"Kar Habib Apne Pidr aur na Madr pe Ghoooror, Ishq mein falan ibn falan haach hai haach\"'''''\n\nEnglish Translation of the Persian couplet:\n\n'''''\"On your ancestry Habib be not proud aught. In the path of love So-and-So, is naught, is naught\"'''''\n\nAs predicted by Hafiz Pir Dastagir ra 2 years later, a male child was born as the fourth child of Nawaab Ahmad Yar Khan ra, as family tradition who was named Habib Yar Khan ra. In [[Hagiography]] \"Tadhkiratul Habib\" (memorial of the beloved) by Hafiz Muhammed Fuzail Soofie Al Habibi ra, Durban, South Africa reported that at the time of the birth of Khwaja Habib ra,  a majzub stood at the door of the home in Kuch-e-Nasim Sultan (located near [[Machli Kaman]] near Charminar, Hyderabad, India) the palace of Nawab Ahmed Yar Khan ra (Mohi ud dowla IV), and pacing the floor in ecstasy repeatedly uttered ''\"Shaykh Paida Shud\" (English Translation: Sheikh has born).\"'' According to the science of [[Abjad]], the year of the birth of Hazrat Pir Khwaja Habib Ali Shah ra is '''\"Ya Sayyid Habib Ali Shah Chishti\"'''\n\nFour years later, the grand Sheikh Hafiz Mohammed Ali Shah Kharaibadi ra visited Hyderabad. He knowingly enquired from Nawab Ahmed Yar Khan ra, \"Well, well was not my child born at your home?\" Nawaab saab ra replied \"Yes\". Hafiz Pir Dastagir asked, \"Well have you named him\"? The Nawaab sahib ra replied in the affirmative. \"What have you named him?\" asked the Sheikh. The Nawaab sahib ra responded respectfully, \"Habib Yar Khan Bahadur\".     Sheikh Mohammed Hafiz Ali Shah (Hafiz Pir Dastagir) ra was very pleased and said, \"I have come to perform the Bismillah (Tasmi khani) ceremony of my son\".       On 23 Shawal 1240 AH at the age of four years four months and four days,  Hazrat Hafiz Pir Dastar ra proceeded with the [[Bismillah ceremony|Bismillah]] of the child and thereafter put the child on test.    A handful of gold coins and a handful of sweetmeats were placed in front of the child and he was asked by the Sheikh to choose that which he desired. The then child (Khwaja Habib ra) placed his hands on both and said, \"I will take both!\". Upon this Hazrat Hafiz Pir Dastagir ra smiled knowingly and declared, \"My child will choose spirituality over wealth, and will be a wealth of spirituality\"!.\n\nAfter the official Bismillah ceremony, Khwaja Habib imitated the actions of his beloved Sheikh by learning and memorizing the verses, meanings and ultimately the secrets of the [[Quran]].\n\n==Discipleship==\nKhaja Pir Habib Ali Shah became the disciple of Shaikh ul Islam Hafiz Sayed Khaja Mohammed Ali Shah Khairabadi Chishti, Quadri, Soharwardy, Naqshbandi (also known as Hafiz Pir Dastagir),  who was the Calipha of Khwaja Suleman Tawsawi of Punjab, India (Now in Pakistan).\n\n==Education and training==\nAt this tender age Khwaja Habib formally began the process of acquiring external as well as internal knowledge. By the age of six, Khwaja Habib would retire to the garden house, in a state of [[wudu]], facing [[qiblah]], covering his face with a cloth and would indulge in [[Muraqabah]], in total privacy. By the age of nine, Khwaja Habib made it a consistent practice to be in a state of wudu. The obvious signs of [[wilayah]] affected his parents and other family members.\n\nAn anecdote narrated by several of his family members and Caliphas: During Id, Khwaja habib's father would listen to the requests of his children as to what they desired as gifts (iddi) on the occasion of happiness/id. When it came to the turn of Khwaja Habib tears would roll down his eyes and he would weep and request \"My dear father, whenever you visit the Khanqah of my beloved Pir-o-Murshid (Sheikh){Hafiz Pir Dastagir ra}, grant me the privilege of accompanying you.\".\n\nAfter studying the Quran and the acquisition of the basic knowledge of Shariat, Hazrat Khwaja Habib Ali Shah ra  was formally initiated into Tariqa by Al Marifah Hafiz Mohammed Ali Shah (Hafiz Pir Dastagir ra) Khairabadi. Khwaja Habib took the bayath on the hands of his Pir at the age of sixteen years six months and eleven days on '''30 Moharram ul Haram 1252 H'''.   In one of the verses in Habibul Talibun Khwaja Habib explains the feelings As:\n\n'''''\"Hum ko Hafiz ki Gali ka woh taswur banddha, Showk Janat na raha bagh Irum bhool gaye\"'''''\n\nEnglish Translation of the Persian couplet:\n\n'''''\"In the thought of Hafiz's alley I was so lost, Desire for heaven, the Gardens of Irum I forgot\"'''''\n\nHazrat Khaja Pir Hafiz Habib Ali Shah ra in his own words reported by his Calipha Shah Mohammed Ibrahim Soofie Habibi ra (whose Dargah Shareef is at Ajmer Shareef India). Afer Bayat I persistently requested from my parents to send me to the Khanqah of my Sheikh Hazrat Hafiz Pir Dastagir ra, but would receive no response from them.    During that period a group of my spiritual brothers (Pir Bhai) was planning to visit the Sheikh in Khairabad.    I secretly sent a petitionary letter by the hand of Hazrat Mirza Sardar Baig Sahib  ra, who was also a calipha of Hazrat Mohammed Ali Shah Khairabadi ra (whose Dargah Shareef is in Aga Pura, Hyderbad, Telangana, India).\n\nWhen the entourage arrived in Khairabad, Hazrat Hafiz Mohammed Ali Shah (Hariz Pir Dastagir) ra was conducting a daily dars (lesson).   The entourage kissed his feet and musfah Hafiz Pir Dastagir ra adjourned the dars (class - lesson) and asked whether all was well.     Everyone responded in the affirmative, having completely forgotten about the letter in the excitement of their arrival at the Khanqah of their Pir.      Finally,  Hazrat Hafiz Mohammed Ali Shah (Hafiz Pir Dastagir) ra  himself was compelled to ask, '''\"Is there anything else? Is there no letter for me?\"'''      At that moment my letter came to mind and was presented to Hazrat Hafiz Pir Dastagir ra.      It is narrated that Hazrat Hafiz Pir Dastagir ra came forward, took the letter placed it on his head, held it to his chest, and wept profusely.      After a while Hazrat Hafiz Pir Dastagir ra regained his composure and opening his arms as if motioning to someone declared resolutely, '''\"I will call him here \"''' !    The highlights of this incident stated in the following verse by Hazrat Khwaja Pir Habib Ali Shah ra in his diwan shareef:\n\n'''''\"Shukr kya uska baja laya Habib Assi  - Ho gaya paesh nazar ye sag darban ka qat\"'''''\n\nEnglish Translation of the Persian couplet:\n\n'''''\"How can gratitude be shown by Habib the sinner. Before his eyes was presented the lowly servant's letter\"'''''\n\nThe letter was taken and placed by Hazrat Hafiz Mohammed Ali Shah (Pir Dastagir) ra in his chest pocket.\n\nHazrat Khwaja Pir Hafiz  Habib Ali Shah ra narrates in Diwan:\n\n'''''Naam sun ke wo Habib Ashiq Ka - Padh ke phir jaayb mein rakha Kagaz'''''\n\nEnglish Translation of the Persian couplet:\n\n'''''Hearing the name of Habib the lover, In his pocket he kept the letter.'''''\nHazrat Khwaja Pir Hafiz  Habib Ali Shah ra performed Hajj (in the year  ****** )\n\nHazrat Khwaja Pir Hafiz  Habib Ali Shah ra spent years in the presence of  Hazrat Khaja Hafiz Mohammed Ali Shah Kharaibadi ra, in order to learn and gain the spiritual benefits (manasik), ultimately he was bestowed with the vision by the karam of Allah.\n\n==Books taught in Khanqa  Habibia==\n\nHazrat Khwaja Pir Hafiz  Habib Ali Shah ra established a Khanqa (schools) in several cities of India.     He was the focal point for the people from various religions, caste, creeds, colours, languages.  They obtained his advise in spiritual development and understanding the Islam in right perspective.     He used to conduct classes of dars Quran and Hadis Nabawi.   Great attention was placed by him on the acquisition of knowledge of Sharia and of the intricate teachings of Tariqah.  Dars (Lessons) were not only given from the classical works of Awliay Allah such as \u201cFasusu Al Hikam\u201d, \u201cRuh Ar Arwah\u201d, \u201cMathanawi Shareef  Moualana Rome ra\u201d, \u201cJazb al Qulub\u201d, \u201cKash al Mahjoub of Hazrat Data Ganj Bakhsh ra\u201d, \u201cKashkol-e-Kalimi of Hazrat Shah Kaleem Ullah Shahanjebad wali ra\u201d and various other classical works, but some of his own books\u2019 such as Habib ul Talibun were specially included in sylabus of  the Khanqa teachings of universal brotherhood. \n\n==Poetry==\n\nHazrat Khwaja Pir Hafiz  Habib Ali Shah ra wrote poetry (Poem) in several languages:  Hindi, Urdu, Farsi (Persian), Kokani. His poetry of Hindi, Farsi and Urdu is still sung by Qawals across the globe.   His poetry (poem) contains hamd, naat, qasaad, homage to his Pir (Master) and other Sufi Saints of his order such as Shaikh Abdul Qadir Jilani ra and Khawajah Moinuddin Chishti ra.\n\nOne of his famous Urdu Couplet\n\n'''''\"Hamari Kuchi bhi Nathi Haqeeqat, Tumhare Dar se mili hain Izzat,'''''<br />\n'''Kharab hoone na dejo Sahib, Tumare dar ka bana huwa hunn\"'''\n\nEnglish translation:\n\n'''''\"We were nothing in reality, from your door we have attained dignity'''''<br />\n'''Sir, Let us not ruined, At your door we have been fashioned.\"'''\n\n==Books written==\n\nHazrat Khwaja Pir Hafiz  Habib Ali Shah ra authored 30+ books in different languages but now being translated in Urdu and English by his disciples.\n\nHe designed syllabus and methodology for the teachings in  Khanqas which are still practiced and admired.

At this stage the mother of Khwaja Habib, Amatul Fatima ra was beyond child bearing age, but since the sheikh had spoken, they believed that [[Allah]] willed otherwise.\n\nIn a couplet in Diwan Habib, Hazrat Khaja Habib Ali Shah ra exhibited love for his Sheikh Mohammed Hafiz Ali Shah Khairabadi ra the parental nobility and worldly life.  In his discourses he explained that the love and respect for the Sheikh the spiritual master.\n\n'''''\"Kar Habib Apne Pidr aur na Madr pe Ghoooror, Ishq mein falan ibn falan haach hai haach\"'''''\n\nEnglish Translation of the Persian couplet:\n\n'''''\"On your ancestry Habib be not proud aught. In the path of love So-and-So, is naught, is naught\"'''''\n\nAs predicted by Hafiz Pir Dastagir ra 2 years later, a male child was born as the fourth child of Nawaab Ahmad Yar Khan ra, as family tradition who was named Habib Yar Khan ra. In [[Hagiography]] \"Tadhkiratul Habib\" (memorial of the beloved) by Hafiz Muhammed Fuzail Soofie Al Habibi ra, Durban, South Africa reported that at the time of the birth of Khwaja Habib ra,  a majzub stood at the door of the home in Kuch-e-Nasim Sultan (located near [[Machli Kaman]] near Charminar, Hyderabad, India) the palace of Nawab Ahmed Yar Khan ra (Mohi ud dowla IV), and pacing the floor in ecstasy repeatedly uttered ''\"Shaykh Paida Shud\" (English Translation: Sheikh has born).\"'' According to the science of [[Abjad]], the year of the birth of Hazrat Pir Khwaja Habib Ali Shah ra is '''\"Ya Sayyid Habib Ali Shah Chishti\"'''\n\nFour years later, the grand Sheikh Hafiz Mohammed Ali Shah Kharaibadi ra visited Hyderabad. He knowingly enquired from Nawab Ahmed Yar Khan ra, \"Well, well was not my child born at your home?\" Nawaab saab ra replied \"Yes\". Hafiz Pir Dastagir asked, \"Well have you named him\"? The Nawaab sahib ra replied in the affirmative. \"What have you named him?\" asked the Sheikh. The Nawaab sahib ra responded respectfully, \"Habib Yar Khan Bahadur\".     Sheikh Mohammed Hafiz Ali Shah (Hafiz Pir Dastagir) ra was very pleased and said, \"I have come to perform the Bismillah (Tasmi khani) ceremony of my son\".       On 23 Shawal 1240 AH at the age of four years four months and four days,  Hazrat Hafiz Pir Dastar ra proceeded with the [[Bismillah ceremony|Bismillah]] of the child and thereafter put the child on test.    A handful of gold coins and a handful of sweetmeats were placed in front of the child and he was asked by the Sheikh to choose that which he desired. The then child (Khwaja Habib ra) placed his hands on both and said, \"I will take both!\". Upon this Hazrat Hafiz Pir Dastagir ra smiled knowingly and declared, \"My child will choose spirituality over wealth, and will be a wealth of spirituality\"!.\n\nAfter the official Bismillah ceremony, Khwaja Habib imitated the actions of his beloved Sheikh by learning and memorizing the verses, meanings and ultimately the secrets of the [[Quran]].\n\n==Discipleship==\nKhaja Pir Habib Ali Shah became the disciple of Shaikh ul Islam Hafiz Sayed Khaja Mohammed Ali Shah Khairabadi Chishti, Quadri, Soharwardy, Naqshbandi (also known as Hafiz Pir Dastagir),  who was the Calipha of Khwaja Suleman Tawsawi of Punjab, India (Now in Pakistan).\n\n==Education and training==\nAt this tender age Khwaja Habib formally began the process of acquiring external as well as internal knowledge. By the age of six, Khwaja Habib would retire to the garden house, in a state of [[wudu]], facing [[qiblah]], covering his face with a cloth and would indulge in [[Muraqabah]], in total privacy. By the age of nine, Khwaja Habib made it a consistent practice to be in a state of wudu. The obvious signs of [[wilayah]] affected his parents and other family members.\n\nAn anecdote narrated by several of his family members and Caliphas: During Id, Khwaja habib's father would listen to the requests of his children as to what they desired as gifts (iddi) on the occasion of happiness/id. When it came to the turn of Khwaja Habib tears would roll down his eyes and he would weep and request \"My dear father, whenever you visit the Khanqah of my beloved Pir-o-Murshid (Sheikh){Hafiz Pir Dastagir ra}, grant me the privilege of accompanying you.\".\n\nAfter studying the Quran and the acquisition of the basic knowledge of Shariat, Hazrat Khwaja Habib Ali Shah ra  was formally initiated into Tariqa by Al Marifah Hafiz Mohammed Ali Shah (Hafiz Pir Dastagir ra) Khairabadi. Khwaja Habib took the bayath on the hands of his Pir at the age of sixteen years six months and eleven days on '''30 Moharram ul Haram 1252 H'''.   In one of the verses in Habibul Talibun Khwaja Habib explains the feelings As:\n\n'''''\"Hum ko Hafiz ki Gali ka woh taswur banddha, Showk Janat na raha bagh Irum bhool gaye\"'''''\n\nEnglish Translation of the Persian couplet:\n\n'''''\"In the thought of Hafiz's alley I was so lost, Desire for heaven, the Gardens of Irum I forgot\"'''''\n\nHazrat Khaja Pir Hafiz Habib Ali Shah ra in his own words reported by his Calipha Shah Mohammed Ibrahim Soofie Habibi ra (whose Dargah Shareef is at Ajmer Shareef India). Afer Bayat I persistently requested from my parents to send me to the Khanqah of my Sheikh Hazrat Hafiz Pir Dastagir ra, but would receive no response from them.

The entourage kissed his feet and musfah Hafiz Pir Dastagir ra adjourned the dars (class - lesson) and asked whether all was well.     Everyone responded in the affirmative, having completely forgotten about the letter in the excitement of their arrival at the Khanqah of their Pir.      Finally,  Hazrat Hafiz Mohammed Ali Shah (Hafiz Pir Dastagir) ra  himself was compelled to ask, '''\"Is there anything else? Is there no letter for me?\"'''      At that moment my letter came to mind and was presented to Hazrat Hafiz Pir Dastagir ra.

The highlights of this incident stated in the following verse by Hazrat Khwaja Pir Habib Ali Shah ra in his diwan shareef:\n\n'''''\"Shukr kya uska baja laya Habib Assi  - Ho gaya paesh nazar ye sag darban ka qat\"'''''\n\nEnglish Translation of the Persian couplet:\n\n'''''\"How can gratitude be shown by Habib the sinner. Before his eyes was presented the lowly servant's letter\"'''''\n\nThe letter was taken and placed by Hazrat Hafiz Mohammed Ali Shah (Pir Dastagir) ra in his chest pocket.\n\nHazrat Khwaja Pir Hafiz  Habib Ali Shah ra narrates in Diwan:\n\n'''''Naam sun ke wo Habib Ashiq Ka - Padh ke phir jaayb mein rakha Kagaz'''''\n\nEnglish Translation of the Persian couplet:\n\n'''''Hearing the name of Habib the lover, In his pocket he kept the letter.'''''\nHazrat Khwaja Pir Hafiz  Habib Ali Shah ra performed Hajj (in the year  ****** )\n\nHazrat Khwaja Pir Hafiz  Habib Ali Shah ra spent years in the presence of  Hazrat Khaja Hafiz Mohammed Ali Shah Kharaibadi ra, in order to learn and gain the spiritual benefits (manasik), ultimately he was bestowed with the vision by the karam of Allah.\n\n==Books taught in Khanqa  Habibia==\n\nHazrat Khwaja Pir Hafiz  Habib Ali Shah ra established a Khanqa (schools) in several cities of India.

The family vacationed on the Pacific coast in [[Gearhart, Oregon]], where Beard was exposed to [[Pacific Northwest cuisine]].\n \nCommon ingredients of this cuisine are [[salmon]], [[shellfish]], and other fresh [[seafood]]; [[Game (food)|game]] meats such as [[moose]], [[elk]], or [[venison]]; [[mushroom]]s, [[Berry|berries]], small [[fruit]]s, [[potato]]es, [[kale]], and wild plants such as [[fiddleheads]] or young pushki (''[[Heracleum maximum]]'', or cow parsnip).\n\nBeard's earliest memory of food was at the 1905 [[Lewis and Clark Exposition]], when he was two years old. In his [[memoir]] he recalled:\n\n<blockquote>\nI was taken to the exposition two or three times. The thing that remained in my mind above all others\u2014I think it marked my life\u2014was watching [[Triscuit]]s and shredded wheat biscuits being made. Isn't that crazy? At two years old that memory was made. It intrigued the hell out of me.<ref>Beard, ''A James Beard Memoir'', pg. 25</ref></blockquote>\n\nAt age three Beard was bedridden with [[malaria]], and the illness gave him time to focus on the food prepared by his mother and their [[Chinese people|Chinese]] helper.<ref>Kamp, pg. 19</ref> According to Beard he was raised by Thema and Jue-Let, who instilled in him a passion for [[Chinese culture]].<ref>Beard, ''A James Beard Memoir'', pg. 20</ref> Beard reportedly \"attributes much of his upbringing to Jue-Let,\" whom he refers to as his Chinese godfather.<ref name=\"Saveur\">[http://www.saveur.com/james-beard-chinese-jue-let/ Dao, Dan Q. \"Who was Jue-Let, the Unknown Chinese Chef Who Raised James Beard?

Unlucky in the theater, he and friend Bill Rhodes capitalized on the [[cocktail party]] craze by opening Hors d'Oeuvre, Inc., a [[catering]] company. This led to lecturing, teaching, writing, and the publication of Beard's first cookbook in 1940: ''Hors D'Oeuvre and Canap\u00e9s'', a compilation of his catering recipes. According to fellow cooking enthusiast [[Julia Child]], this book put him on the culinary map.<ref name=\"childsvi\">Beard, ''James Beard Beard on Food'', pg. vi</ref> [[World War II]] rationing ended Beard's catering business. From August 1946 to May 1947, he hosted ''[[I Love to Eat]]'', a live television cooking show on NBC, beginning his ascent as an American food authority. According to Child, \"Through the years he gradually became not only the leading culinary figure in the country, but 'The Dean of American Cuisine'.\"<ref name=\"childsvi\"/>\n\nIn 1952, when [[Helen Evans Brown]] published her ''Helen Brown's West Coast Cook Book'', Beard wrote her a letter igniting a friendship that spanned until Brown's death. The two, along with her husband Phillip, developed a friendship which was both professional and personal. Beard and Brown became like siblings, admonishing and encouraging each other, as well as collaborating.<ref name=\"Ferrone (1995)\">{{cite book|ref=harv|last1=Ferrone|first1=John|chapter=Introduction|editor-last1=Beard|editor-first1=James|title=Love and Kisses and a Halo of Truffles: Letters from Helen Evans Brown|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=32nR9wP2wpoC&pg=PR8|edition=1|year=1995|publisher=Arcade Publishing|location=New York, New York|isbn=978-1-55970-318-5|pp=vii-xiv}}</ref>\nAccording to the James Beard Foundation website, \"In 1955, he established The James Beard Cooking School. He continued to teach cooking to men and women for the next thirty years, both at his own schools (in New York City and Seaside, Oregon), and around the country at women's clubs, other cooking schools, and civic groups. He was a tireless traveler, bringing his message of good food, honestly prepared with fresh, wholesome, American ingredients, to a country just becoming aware of its own culinary heritage.\"<ref>\"[http://www.jamesbeard.org/ James Beard Foundation Website]\". James Beard Foundation. Retrieved on July 19, 2010.</ref>\nBeard brought French cooking to the American middle and upper classes during the 1950s, appearing on TV as a cooking personality. David Kamp (who discusses Beard at length in his book, ''The United States of Arugula'') noted that Beard's was the first cooking show on TV.<ref>Kamp, pg. 55</ref> He compares [[Dione Lucas]]' cooking show and school with Beard's, noting that their prominence during the 1950s marked the emergence of a sophisticated, New York-based, nationally  and internationally known food culture.<ref>Kamp, pg. 57</ref> Kamp wrote, \"It was in this decade [the 1950s] that Beard made his name as ''James Beard'', the brand name, the face and belly of American gastronomy.\"<ref>Kamp, pg. 58</ref> He noted that Beard met [[Alice B. Toklas]] on a trip to Paris,<ref>Kamp, pg. 60</ref> indicative of the network of fellow food celebrities who would follow him during his life and carry on his legacy after his death.\n\nBeard made endorsement deals to promote products that he might not have otherwise used or suggested in his own cuisine, including [[Omaha Steaks]], [[French's]] Mustard, [[Green Giant]] Corn Niblets, [[Old Crow]] bourbon, [[Planters|Planters Peanuts]], [[Shasta (soft drink)|Shasta]] soft drinks, [[DuPont]] chemicals, and [[Lawry's and Adolph's|Adolph's Meat Tenderizer]]. According to Kamp, Beard later felt himself a \"gastronomic whore\" for doing so. Although he felt that mass-produced food that was neither fresh, local nor seasonal was a betrayal of his gastronomic beliefs, he needed the money for his cooking schools.<ref>Kamp, pg. 62</ref> According to Thomas McNamee, \"Beard, a man of stupendous appetites\u2014for food, sex, money, you name it\u2014stunned his subtler colleagues.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=McNamee|first=Thomas|title=The Man Who Changed the Way We Eat|url=https://archive.org/details/manwhochangedway0000mcna|url-access=registration|year=2012|publisher=Free Press, Div of Simon & Schuster|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-1-4391-9150-7|pages=[https://archive.org/details/manwhochangedway0000mcna/page/339 339]}}</ref> In 1981 Beard and friend [[Gael Greene]] founded [[Citymeals-on-Wheels]], which continues to help feed the homebound elderly in New York City.\n\n==Personal life==\n[[Julia Child]] summed up Beard's personal life:\n<blockquote>Beard was the quintessential American cook. Well-educated and well-traveled during his eighty-two years, he was familiar with many cuisines but he remained fundamentally American. He was a big man, over six feet tall, with a big belly, and huge hands.

In his [[memoir]] he recalled:\n\n<blockquote>\nI was taken to the exposition two or three times. The thing that remained in my mind above all others\u2014I think it marked my life\u2014was watching [[Triscuit]]s and shredded wheat biscuits being made. Isn't that crazy?

Unlucky in the theater, he and friend Bill Rhodes capitalized on the [[cocktail party]] craze by opening Hors d'Oeuvre, Inc., a [[catering]] company. This led to lecturing, teaching, writing, and the publication of Beard's first cookbook in 1940: ''Hors D'Oeuvre and Canap\u00e9s'', a compilation of his catering recipes. According to fellow cooking enthusiast [[Julia Child]], this book put him on the culinary map.<ref name=\"childsvi\">Beard, ''James Beard Beard on Food'', pg. vi</ref> [[World War II]] rationing ended Beard's catering business. From August 1946 to May 1947, he hosted ''[[I Love to Eat]]'', a live television cooking show on NBC, beginning his ascent as an American food authority.

It is distinguished by its irregular shape, its chaotic rotation, and its unexplained sponge-like appearance. It was the first non-[[hydrostatic equilibrium|round]] moon to be discovered.\n\n== Name ==\n\nThe moon is named after [[Hyperion (mythology)|Hyperion]], the [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]] god of watchfulness and observation \u2013 the elder brother of [[Cronus]], the Greek equivalent of [[Saturn (mythology)|Saturn]] \u2013 in [[Greek mythology]]. It is also designated '''Saturn&nbsp;VII'''. The adjectival form of the name is ''Hyperionian''.\n\nHyperion's discovery came shortly after [[John Herschel]] had suggested names for the seven previously known satellites of Saturn in his 1847 publication ''Results of Astronomical Observations made at the Cape of Good Hope''.<ref name=\"Lassell 1848 Observations\" /> [[William Lassell]], who saw Hyperion two days after [[William Cranch Bond|William Bond]], had already endorsed Herschel's naming scheme and suggested the name Hyperion in accordance with it.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n |author=W.

Hyperion has about 15% of the mass of [[Mimas (moon)|Mimas]], the least massive known ellipsoidal body. The largest [[Impact crater|crater]] on Hyperion is approximately {{convert|121.57|km|mi|abbr=on}} in diameter and {{convert|10.2|km|mi|abbr=on}} deep. A possible explanation for the irregular shape is that Hyperion is a fragment of a larger body that was broken up by a large impact in the distant past.<ref name=\"Matthews1992\">\n{{cite journal\n |author=R.A.J.

It is thought that Hyperion may be similar to a loosely accreted pile of rubble in its physical composition. However, unlike most of Saturn's moons, Hyperion has a low [[albedo]] (0.2\u20130.3), indicating that it is covered by at least a thin layer of dark material. This may be material from [[Phoebe (moon)|Phoebe]] (which is much darker) that got past [[Iapetus (moon)|Iapetus]]. Hyperion is [[red]]der than Phoebe and closely matches the color of the dark material on Iapetus.\n\nHyperion has a [[porosity]] of about 0.46.<ref name=\"Thomas2007\" />\n\n=== Surface features ===\n\n{{See also|List of geological features on Hyperion}}\n\n''[[Voyager 2]]'' passed through the Saturn system, but photographed Hyperion only from a distance. It discerned individual craters and an enormous ridge, but was not able to make out the texture of Hyperion's surface. Early images from the ''[[Cassini\u2013Huygens|Cassini]]'' orbiter suggested an unusual appearance, but it was not until ''Cassini'''s first targeted flyby of Hyperion on 25 September 2005 that Hyperion's oddness was revealed in full.\n\nHyperion's surface is covered with deep, sharp-edged [[impact crater|crater]]s that give it the appearance of a giant sponge. Dark material fills the bottom of each crater. The reddish substance contains long chains of [[carbon]] and [[hydrogen]] and appears very similar to material found on other Saturnian satellites, most notably [[Iapetus (moon)|Iapetus]]. Scientists attribute Hyperion's unusual, sponge-like appearance to the fact that it has an unusually low density for such a large object. Its low density makes Hyperion quite porous, with a weak surface gravity. These characteristics mean impactors tend to compress the surface, rather than excavating it, and most material that is blown off the surface never returns.<ref name='next2015'/>\n\nThe latest analyses of data obtained by ''Cassini'' during its flybys of Hyperion in 2005 and 2006 show that about 40 percent of it is empty space. It was suggested in July 2007 that this [[porosity]] allows craters to remain nearly unchanged over the eons. The new analyses also confirmed that Hyperion is composed mostly of water ice with very little rock.<ref>\n{{cite web\n |author=\n |title=Key to Giant Space Sponge Revealed\n |url=http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/070704_sponge_moon.html\n |work=[[Space.com]]\n |accessdate=October 26, 2007\n}}</ref>\n\n== Rotation ==\n[[File:Animation of Hyperion orbit around Saturn.gif|thumb|right|Animation of Hyperion's orbit.<br />{{legend2|RoyalBlue| Saturn}}{{\u00b7}}{{legend2| Magenta | Hyperion}}{{\u00b7}}{{legend2|Cyan|Titan}}]]\n[[File:Hyperion false color.jpg|190px|right|thumb|Hyperion with image processing to bring out details. Taken by the [[Cassini\u2013Huygens|''Cassini'']] space probe.]]\n\nThe ''[[Voyager 2]]'' images and subsequent ground-based [[Photometry (astronomy)|photometry]] indicated that Hyperion's rotation is [[Chaos theory|chaotic]], that is, its axis of rotation wobbles so much that its orientation in space is unpredictable.

These factors combine to restrict the set of conditions under which a stable rotation is possible. The 3:4 [[orbital resonance]] between Titan and Hyperion may also make a chaotic rotation more likely. The fact that its rotation is not locked probably accounts for the relative uniformity of Hyperion's surface, in contrast to many of [[Saturn's natural satellites|Saturn's other moons]], which have contrasting trailing and leading hemispheres.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n |first1 = J. | last1 = Wisdom | first2 = S.J. | last2 = Peale | first3 = F. | last3 = Mignard\n |date=1984\n |title=The chaotic rotation of Hyperion\n |journal=[[Icarus (journal)|Icarus]]\n |volume=58 |issue= 2|pages=137\u2013152\n |bibcode=1984Icar...58..137W\n |doi=10.1016/0019-1035(84)90032-0\n| citeseerx = 10.1.1.394.2728 }}</ref>\n\n== Exploration ==\n\nHyperion has been imaged several times from moderate distances by the [[Cassini\u2013Huygens|''Cassini'' orbiter]].

It is distinguished by its irregular shape, its chaotic rotation, and its unexplained sponge-like appearance. It was the first non-[[hydrostatic equilibrium|round]] moon to be discovered.\n\n== Name ==\n\nThe moon is named after [[Hyperion (mythology)|Hyperion]], the [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]] god of watchfulness and observation \u2013 the elder brother of [[Cronus]], the Greek equivalent of [[Saturn (mythology)|Saturn]] \u2013 in [[Greek mythology]]. It is also designated '''Saturn&nbsp;VII'''. The adjectival form of the name is ''Hyperionian''.\n\nHyperion's discovery came shortly after [[John Herschel]] had suggested names for the seven previously known satellites of Saturn in his 1847 publication ''Results of Astronomical Observations made at the Cape of Good Hope''.<ref name=\"Lassell 1848 Observations\" /> [[William Lassell]], who saw Hyperion two days after [[William Cranch Bond|William Bond]], had already endorsed Herschel's naming scheme and suggested the name Hyperion in accordance with it.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n |author=W.

Hyperion has about 15% of the mass of [[Mimas (moon)|Mimas]], the least massive known ellipsoidal body. The largest [[Impact crater|crater]] on Hyperion is approximately {{convert|121.57|km|mi|abbr=on}} in diameter and {{convert|10.2|km|mi|abbr=on}} deep. A possible explanation for the irregular shape is that Hyperion is a fragment of a larger body that was broken up by a large impact in the distant past.<ref name=\"Matthews1992\">\n{{cite journal\n |author=R.A.J.

It is thought that Hyperion may be similar to a loosely accreted pile of rubble in its physical composition. However, unlike most of Saturn's moons, Hyperion has a low [[albedo]] (0.2\u20130.3), indicating that it is covered by at least a thin layer of dark material. This may be material from [[Phoebe (moon)|Phoebe]] (which is much darker) that got past [[Iapetus (moon)|Iapetus]]. Hyperion is [[red]]der than Phoebe and closely matches the color of the dark material on Iapetus.\n\nHyperion has a [[porosity]] of about 0.46.<ref name=\"Thomas2007\" />\n\n=== Surface features ===\n\n{{See also|List of geological features on Hyperion}}\n\n''[[Voyager 2]]'' passed through the Saturn system, but photographed Hyperion only from a distance. It discerned individual craters and an enormous ridge, but was not able to make out the texture of Hyperion's surface. Early images from the ''[[Cassini\u2013Huygens|Cassini]]'' orbiter suggested an unusual appearance, but it was not until ''Cassini'''s first targeted flyby of Hyperion on 25 September 2005 that Hyperion's oddness was revealed in full.\n\nHyperion's surface is covered with deep, sharp-edged [[impact crater|crater]]s that give it the appearance of a giant sponge. Dark material fills the bottom of each crater. The reddish substance contains long chains of [[carbon]] and [[hydrogen]] and appears very similar to material found on other Saturnian satellites, most notably [[Iapetus (moon)|Iapetus]]. Scientists attribute Hyperion's unusual, sponge-like appearance to the fact that it has an unusually low density for such a large object. Its low density makes Hyperion quite porous, with a weak surface gravity. These characteristics mean impactors tend to compress the surface, rather than excavating it, and most material that is blown off the surface never returns.<ref name='next2015'/>\n\nThe latest analyses of data obtained by ''Cassini'' during its flybys of Hyperion in 2005 and 2006 show that about 40 percent of it is empty space. It was suggested in July 2007 that this [[porosity]] allows craters to remain nearly unchanged over the eons. The new analyses also confirmed that Hyperion is composed mostly of water ice with very little rock.<ref>\n{{cite web\n |author=\n |title=Key to Giant Space Sponge Revealed\n |url=http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/070704_sponge_moon.html\n |work=[[Space.com]]\n |accessdate=October 26, 2007\n}}</ref>\n\n== Rotation ==\n[[File:Animation of Hyperion orbit around Saturn.gif|thumb|right|Animation of Hyperion's orbit.<br />{{legend2|RoyalBlue| Saturn}}{{\u00b7}}{{legend2| Magenta | Hyperion}}{{\u00b7}}{{legend2|Cyan|Titan}}]]\n[[File:Hyperion false color.jpg|190px|right|thumb|Hyperion with image processing to bring out details. Taken by the [[Cassini\u2013Huygens|''Cassini'']] space probe.]]\n\nThe ''[[Voyager 2]]'' images and subsequent ground-based [[Photometry (astronomy)|photometry]] indicated that Hyperion's rotation is [[Chaos theory|chaotic]], that is, its axis of rotation wobbles so much that its orientation in space is unpredictable.

These factors combine to restrict the set of conditions under which a stable rotation is possible. The 3:4 [[orbital resonance]] between Titan and Hyperion may also make a chaotic rotation more likely. The fact that its rotation is not locked probably accounts for the relative uniformity of Hyperion's surface, in contrast to many of [[Saturn's natural satellites|Saturn's other moons]], which have contrasting trailing and leading hemispheres.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n |first1 = J. | last1 = Wisdom | first2 = S.J. | last2 = Peale | first3 = F. | last3 = Mignard\n |date=1984\n |title=The chaotic rotation of Hyperion\n |journal=[[Icarus (journal)|Icarus]]\n |volume=58 |issue= 2|pages=137\u2013152\n |bibcode=1984Icar...58..137W\n |doi=10.1016/0019-1035(84)90032-0\n| citeseerx = 10.1.1.394.2728 }}</ref>\n\n== Exploration ==\n\nHyperion has been imaged several times from moderate distances by the [[Cassini\u2013Huygens|''Cassini'' orbiter]].

To convince local communities, it set up meetings with residents and distributed leaflets advertising the change.

The goals of skip-stop service were to extend all trips to 242nd Street, to provide faster travel times for a majority of riders, and to improve service reliability through evenly loaded and spaced trains. During 1987 and 1988, analysis was conducted to determine various options for express service along the 1, including using the center express track. As part of the plan, express service was to operate weekdays between 6:30&nbsp;a.m. and 7 p.m.. Trips that ended at 137th Street were extended to 242nd Street, which eliminated the need for a significant reduction in service levels at local stops. The 125th Street station, which is located south of 137th Street, would have experienced a reduction in service. The location of all-stop stations and skip-stop stations was done to evenly distribute passengers between the 1 and the 9, and to accommodate reverse commuting patterns. Stops with ridership greater than 8,000 daily passengers were designated all-stop stations, while less patronized stops were served by either 1 or 9 trains. One change was made from the 1988 plan: due to community input 181st Street was added as an all-stop station. Express service was expected to save up to 2.5 minutes of travel time, while all-stop stations would see an additional 2.5 minute reduction in waiting time. This would save between six and nine minutes or a 19% travel time reduction. Running express service via the center track was dismissed since the track had not been designed for express service. The track south of 145th Street is not long enough to allow an express train to pass a local, resulting in merging delays at 103rd Street which would eliminate any time saved. In addition, the busiest stops on the route north of 96th Street would be bypassed without any time savings. Extending all-local service to 242nd Street or adding additional trains were dismissed since they would require additional subway cars, which were not available at the time.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.laguardiawagnerarchive.lagcc.cuny.edu/FileBrowser.aspx?LinkToFile=FILES_DOC/Koch_FILES/08.005.0000.0000268.05.PDF#undefined|title=#1 Broadway/7th Ave Line Skip-Stop Express Service|date=May 4, 1989|website=laguardiawagnerarchive.lagcc.cuny.edu|publisher=New York City Transit Authority|access-date=March 20, 2019}}</ref>\n\nOn July 28, 1989, the MTA Board approved a revised 1/9 skip-stop plan unanimously, with the plan scheduled to take effect on August 21, 1989.

Initially, there were two main service patterns south of 96th Street: a local service to [[South Ferry (Manhattan)|South Ferry]] in [[Manhattan]], and an express service to [[Brooklyn]]. The express service was discontinued in 1959. From 1989 to 2005, the 1 ran in a [[skip-stop]] service pattern during rush hours, with the [[9 (New York City Subway service)|9]] providing the complementary skip-stop service on the same route. The 1 and 9 trains were rerouted after the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001; although they had mostly resumed their normal route by 2002, the 1 train skipped the [[Cortlandt Street (IRT Broadway\u2013Seventh Avenue Line)|Cortlandt Street]] station until 2018.\n\n== Service history ==\n=== Early service ===\n<div class=\"thumb tleft\">\n{| width=\"80\"\n[[File:R12 IRT 1.svg|64px]]\n|-\n|<div class=\"thumbcaption\">Original [[R12 (New York City Subway car)|R12]] to [[R36 (New York City Subway car)|R36]] end rollsign</div>\n|}\n</div>\n\nWhen the New York City Subway [[Early history of the IRT subway|began operation]] between 1904 and 1908, one of the main service patterns was the West Side Branch, which the modern 1 train uses.

There was both local and express service with express trains using the express tracks south of [[96th Street (IRT Broadway\u2013Seventh Avenue Line)|96th Street]].

However, the agency settled on skip-stop service because the center track existed in two discontinuous segments, which would require complicated track-switching maneuvers to accommodate the express trains. Most passengers would not have to wait longer for a train: previously, one-third of 1 trains had terminated at 137th Street, but under the new service pattern, these trains would run the full route to 242nd Street instead.<ref name=\":02\" /> Previously, stations north of 137th Street were served by a train every 10 minutes.

To convince local communities, it set up meetings with residents and distributed leaflets advertising the change.

The goals of skip-stop service were to extend all trips to 242nd Street, to provide faster travel times for a majority of riders, and to improve service reliability through evenly loaded and spaced trains. During 1987 and 1988, analysis was conducted to determine various options for express service along the 1, including using the center express track. As part of the plan, express service was to operate weekdays between 6:30&nbsp;a.m. and 7 p.m.. Trips that ended at 137th Street were extended to 242nd Street, which eliminated the need for a significant reduction in service levels at local stops. The 125th Street station, which is located south of 137th Street, would have experienced a reduction in service. The location of all-stop stations and skip-stop stations was done to evenly distribute passengers between the 1 and the 9, and to accommodate reverse commuting patterns. Stops with ridership greater than 8,000 daily passengers were designated all-stop stations, while less patronized stops were served by either 1 or 9 trains. One change was made from the 1988 plan: due to community input 181st Street was added as an all-stop station. Express service was expected to save up to 2.5 minutes of travel time, while all-stop stations would see an additional 2.5 minute reduction in waiting time. This would save between six and nine minutes or a 19% travel time reduction. Running express service via the center track was dismissed since the track had not been designed for express service. The track south of 145th Street is not long enough to allow an express train to pass a local, resulting in merging delays at 103rd Street which would eliminate any time saved. In addition, the busiest stops on the route north of 96th Street would be bypassed without any time savings. Extending all-local service to 242nd Street or adding additional trains were dismissed since they would require additional subway cars, which were not available at the time.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.laguardiawagnerarchive.lagcc.cuny.edu/FileBrowser.aspx?LinkToFile=FILES_DOC/Koch_FILES/08.005.0000.0000268.05.PDF#undefined|title=#1 Broadway/7th Ave Line Skip-Stop Express Service|date=May 4, 1989|website=laguardiawagnerarchive.lagcc.cuny.edu|publisher=New York City Transit Authority|access-date=March 20, 2019}}</ref>\n\nOn July 28, 1989, the MTA Board approved a revised 1/9 skip-stop plan unanimously, with the plan scheduled to take effect on August 21, 1989.

Zhao is a career politician with extensive experience in the [[Communist Youth League]], and previously served as the party chief of [[Tangshan]], the executive vice governor of Hebei, and the [[deputy party chief]] of Hebei. Zhao was a controversial figure who was criticized for his role in the censorship of the ''Bingdian'' column of the Youth League's flagship newspaper, and for a massive project he undertook in [[Caofeidian]] that ended in failure.\n\n==Biography==\n\nZhao Yong was born in [[Yiyang]], [[Hunan]] in 1963. He attended Hunan Water Works and Hydroelectric College, earning a college diploma. He was assigned by the state to work in [[Li County, Hunan]], where he began working for a town administrative office. In 1985 he entered the department of civil affairs in Hunan province. In 1988 he entered [[Hunan University]] and earned a [[Master of Business Administration]]. In November 1991, he became deputy chief of the Hunan Communist Youth League (CYL) organization. In 1994 he entered the central organization of the CYL, eventually joining the CYL Secretariat; he served under CYL leaders [[Li Keqiang]] and [[Zhou Qiang]]. While at the Youth League he earned a doctorate in business administration at [[Renmin University of China]].\n\n===''Bingdian'' controversy===\n''Bingdian'' (\u51b0\u70b9) is a column published on the ''[[China Youth Daily]]'', the flagship newspaper of the Communist Youth League. While the column was popular with the newspaper's readership, some articles published on the column earned scorn from the [[Propaganda Department of the Communist Party of China]] and officials within the Youth League.  In July 2004, author and ''Youth Daily'' columnist Lu Yuegang published an article criticizing Zhao Yong alleging that Zhao had been unduly interfering in the contents of the column. The conflict between the newspaper publishers, Zhao Yong, and other authorities eventually led to the suspension of the column on the newspaper.<ref>[http://www.zaobao.com/special/report/politic/cnpol/story20111202-139424 \u8d75\u52c7\u8f9e\u4efb\u526f\u7701\u957f\u540e\u9996\u6b21\u4eae\u76f8]</ref>\n\n=== Caofeidian controversy===\nIn November 2005, the 42-year-old Zhao joined the Hebei [[provincial Party Standing Committee]], leaving the CYL organization. He first served as head of the provincial propaganda department, before being transferred to become party chief of [[Tangshan]]. During his stint as the top official of Tangshan, Zhao devoted his energy into massive development of the [[Caofeidian]] area of the city, trumpeting it as the \"number one project in the province.\" Zhao advocated for the creation of a 30 billion yuan \"start-up fund\" to develop the area, and said the area would attract over 300 billion yuan worth of investment. He also spearheaded plans to create an agricultural-commercial bank, the listing of Caofeidian assets on the public stock exchange, and organizing a state-directed Caofeidian investment company. In the end all projects failed to come to fruition and the Caofeidian investments were largely regarded as a failure; many local officials resigned due to the development project being unable to afford the tens of millions of yuan in daily interest accumulated on the debt.<ref>[http://hebei.news.163.com/13/0526/13/8VQAQS730279063H_4.html \u66f9\u5983\u7538\u5de5\u4e1a\u533a\u70c2\u5c3e\u4e25\u91cd \u6bcf\u65e5\u8d85\u5343\u4e07\u5de8\u503a\u903c\u5b98\u5458\u8f9e\u804c]</ref><ref name=duowei>{{cite news|title=\u56e2\u6d3e\u5931\u52bf\uff1f\u4f20\u8d75\u52c7\u9047\u654f\u611f\u95ee\u9898\u987f\u65f6\u9ed1\u8138|url=http://china.dwnews.com/news/2015-03-04/59639105.html|work=Duowei News|date=March 4, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Hebei leadership===\nThe Caofeidian project, however, did not sputter Zhao's political career. In October 2010, Zhao was named executive vice governor of Hebei, the second-highest ranked government executive position in the province; then a year later, was elevated to the even more prestigious position of Deputy Communist Party Secretary of Hebei province, overseeing party affairs and the provincial party school.<ref>[http://news.sina.com.cn/c/2011-11-28/150823538001.shtml \u6cb3\u5317\u7701\u5e38\u52a1\u526f\u7701\u957f\u8d75\u52c7\u8c03\u4efb\u7701\u59d4\u526f\u4e66\u8bb0]</ref>  During his vice governorship, Zhao suggested that the counties of Hebei province surrounding Beijing adopt an \"economic circle\" approach, powering off the economic growth in the capital region; it is not clear if his vision was implemented.<ref>[http://www.soufun.com/news/2011-04-13/4853657_all.html \u8d75\u52c7\u5c31\u6cb3\u5317\u7701\u5efa\u8bbe\u73af\u9996\u90fd\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5708\u7b54\u8bb0\u8005\u95ee]</ref>\n\nOn September 25, 2013, Zhao appeared on the CCTV program ''Point'' as part of a [[democratic life meeting]] held by the provincial party leadership. At the meeting, Hebei party chief [[Zhou Benshun]] said, \"Comrade Zhao Yong is a self-starter and is confident and enthusiastic, but he often does things in haste, and is too concerned about the scale and superficial showiness of his projects; this can lead to a departure from reality.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.ifeng.com/mainland/special/minzhushenghuohui/content-3/detail_2013_09/26/29880164_0.shtml|title=\u6cb3\u5317\u4e66\u8bb0\u6279\u8bc4\u526f\u4e66\u8bb0\uff1a\u5e72\u4e8b\u8fc7\u4e8e\u8ffd\u6c42\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u58f0\u52bf\u548c\u5f62\u5f0f|accessdate=2013-09-26|publisher=\u51e4\u51f0\u7f51}}</ref>\n\nAfter [[Ling Jihua]] was removed from office on corruption charges, Zhao, who was commonly associated with the Communist Youth League, was interviewed by the media about his thoughts on the matter.

Over a month later, it was announced that he would become the deputy director of the National Administration of Sports, a move interpreted as a demotion.

Zhao was a controversial figure who was criticized for his role in the censorship of the ''Bingdian'' column of the Youth League's flagship newspaper, and for a massive project he undertook in [[Caofeidian]] that ended in failure.\n\n==Biography==\n\nZhao Yong was born in [[Yiyang]], [[Hunan]] in 1963. He attended Hunan Water Works and Hydroelectric College, earning a college diploma. He was assigned by the state to work in [[Li County, Hunan]], where he began working for a town administrative office. In 1985 he entered the department of civil affairs in Hunan province. In 1988 he entered [[Hunan University]] and earned a [[Masters of Business Administration]]. In November 1991, he became deputy chief of the Hunan Communist Youth League (CYL) organization. In 1994 he entered the central organization of the CYL, eventually joining the CYL Secretariat; he served under CYL leaders [[Li Keqiang]] and [[Zhou Qiang]]. While at the Youth League he earned a doctorate in business administration at [[Renmin University of China]].\n\n===''Bingdian'' controversy===\n''Bingdian'' (\u51b0\u70b9) is a column published on the ''[[China Youth Daily]]'', the flagship newspaper of the Communist Youth League. While the column was popular with the newspaper's readership, some articles published on the column earned scorn from the [[Propaganda Department of the Communist Party of China]] and officials within the Youth League.  In July 2004, author and ''Youth Daily'' columnist Lu Yuegang published an article criticizing Zhao Yong alleging that Zhao had been unduly interfering in the contents of the column. The conflict between the newspaper publishers, Zhao Yong, and other authorities eventually led to the suspension of the column on the newspaper.<ref>[http://www.zaobao.com/special/report/politic/cnpol/story20111202-139424 \u8d75\u52c7\u8f9e\u4efb\u526f\u7701\u957f\u540e\u9996\u6b21\u4eae\u76f8]</ref>\n\n=== Caofeidian controversy===\nIn November 2005, the 42-year-old Zhao joined the Hebei [[provincial Party Standing Committee]], leaving the CYL organization. He first served as head of the provincial propaganda department, before being transferred to become party chief of [[Tangshan]]. During his stint as the top official of Tangshan, Zhao devoted his energy into massive development of the [[Caofeidian]] area of the city, trumpeting it as the \"number one project in the province.\" Zhao advocated for the creation of a 30 billion yuan \"start-up fund\" to develop the area, and said the area would attract over 300 billion yuan worth of investment. He also spearheaded plans to create an agricultural-commercial bank, the listing of Caofeidian assets on the public stock exchange, and organizing a state-directed Caofeidian investment company. In the end all projects failed to come to fruition and the Caofeidian investments were largely regarded as a failure; many local officials resigned due to the development project being unable to afford the tens of millions of yuan in daily interest accumulated on the debt.<ref>[http://hebei.news.163.com/13/0526/13/8VQAQS730279063H_4.html \u66f9\u5983\u7538\u5de5\u4e1a\u533a\u70c2\u5c3e\u4e25\u91cd \u6bcf\u65e5\u8d85\u5343\u4e07\u5de8\u503a\u903c\u5b98\u5458\u8f9e\u804c]</ref><ref name=duowei>{{cite news|title=\u56e2\u6d3e\u5931\u52bf\uff1f\u4f20\u8d75\u52c7\u9047\u654f\u611f\u95ee\u9898\u987f\u65f6\u9ed1\u8138|url=http://china.dwnews.com/news/2015-03-04/59639105.html|work=Duowei News|date=March 4, 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Hebei leadership===\nThe Caofeidian project, however, did not sputter Zhao's political career. In October 2010, Zhao was named executive vice governor of Hebei, the second-highest ranked government executive position in the province; then a year later, was elevated to the even more prestigious position of Deputy Communist Party Secretary of Hebei province, overseeing party affairs and the provincial party school.<ref>[http://news.sina.com.cn/c/2011-11-28/150823538001.shtml \u6cb3\u5317\u7701\u5e38\u52a1\u526f\u7701\u957f\u8d75\u52c7\u8c03\u4efb\u7701\u59d4\u526f\u4e66\u8bb0]</ref>  During his vice governorship, Zhao suggested that the counties of Hebei province surrounding Beijing adopt an \"economic circle\" approach, powering off the economic growth in the capital region; it is not clear if his vision was implemented.<ref>[http://www.soufun.com/news/2011-04-13/4853657_all.html \u8d75\u52c7\u5c31\u6cb3\u5317\u7701\u5efa\u8bbe\u73af\u9996\u90fd\u7ecf\u6d4e\u5708\u7b54\u8bb0\u8005\u95ee]</ref>\n\nOn September 25, 2013, Zhao appeared on the CCTV program ''Point'' as part of a [[democratic life meeting]] held by the provincial party leadership. At the meeting, Hebei party chief [[Zhou Benshun]] said, \"Comrade Zhao Yong is a self-starter and is confident and enthusiastic, but he often does things in haste, and is too concerned about the scale and superficial showiness of his projects; this can lead to a departure from reality.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.ifeng.com/mainland/special/minzhushenghuohui/content-3/detail_2013_09/26/29880164_0.shtml|title=\u6cb3\u5317\u4e66\u8bb0\u6279\u8bc4\u526f\u4e66\u8bb0\uff1a\u5e72\u4e8b\u8fc7\u4e8e\u8ffd\u6c42\u89c4\u6a21\u3001\u58f0\u52bf\u548c\u5f62\u5f0f|accessdate=2013-09-26|publisher=\u51e4\u51f0\u7f51}}</ref>\n\nAfter [[Ling Jihua]] was removed from office on corruption charges, Zhao, who was commonly associated with the Communist Youth League, was interviewed by the media about his thoughts on the matter. Zhao looked irritated when approached by journalists and said, \"don't interview me about this matter.\"<ref name=tuanpai>[http://news.creaders.net/china/2015/03/04/1499043.html \u542c\u5230\u56e2\u6d3e\u5931\u52bf \u8d75\u52c7\u987f\u65f6\u9ed1\u8138]</ref>\n\nZhao was relieved of his duties as Hebei deputy party chief in October 2016 without the phrase ''lingyou renyong'' (roughly, \"has been transferred to another assignment\") included in the announcement, prompting speculation about his fate. Over a month later, it was announced that he would become the deputy director of the National Administration of Sports, a move interpreted as a demotion.
