This in turn derives from [[:wikt:\u03b8\u03b5\u03cc\u03c2|\u03b8\u03b5\u03cc\u03c2]] (''theos''), meaning \"god\", and [[:wikt:\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03ad\u03c9|\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03ad\u03c9]] (''krateo''), meaning \"to rule\". Thus the meaning of the word in Greek was \"rule by god(s)\" or human [[incarnation]](s) of god(s).\n\nThe term was initially coined by [[Flavius Josephus]] in the first century A.D. to describe the characteristic government of the [[Jew]]s. Josephus argued that while mankind had developed many forms of rule, most could be subsumed under the following  three types: [[monarchy]], [[oligarchy]], and [[democracy]]. The government of the Jews, however, was unique. Josephus offered the term \"theocracy\" to describe this polity, ordained by Moses, in which God is sovereign and his word is law.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/2849/2849-h/2849-h.htm|title=Against Apion by Flavius Josephus, Book II, Chapter 17|work=gutenberg.org|date=October 2001}}</ref>\n\nJosephus' definition was widely accepted until the [[The Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] era, when the term started to collect more universalistic{{Clarify|date=April 2010}} and negative [[connotation]]s, especially in [[Hegel]]'s hands. The first recorded English use was in 1622, with the meaning \"sacerdotal government under divine inspiration\" (as in Biblical Israel before the rise of kings); the meaning \"priestly or religious body wielding political and civil power\" is recorded from 1825.\n\n==Synopsis==\n{{tone|section|date=December 2016}}\nIn some religions, the ruler, usually a king, was regarded as the chosen favorite of God (or gods) and could not be questioned, sometimes even being the descendant of or a god in their own right. Today, there is also a form of government where clerics have the power and the supreme leader could not be questioned in action. From the perspective of the theocratic government, \"God himself is recognized as the head\" of the state,<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14568a.htm Catholic Encyclopedia] \"A form of civil government in which God himself is recognized as the head.\"</ref> hence the term ''theocracy'', from the [[Koine Greek]] {{lang|grc|\u03b8\u03b5\u03bf\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03af\u03b1}} \"rule of God\", a term used by [[Josephus]] for the [[kingdoms of Israel and Judah]].<ref>English form the 17th century (''[[OED]]'').\nThe Greek term is explicitly coined by Josephus and isn't attested elsewhere in Ancient Greek; Josephus marks it as a [[nonce word|nonce]] coinage by calling it a \"strained expression\".\nW. Whiston tr. [[Josephus]], ''Against Apion'' ii. \u00a717 (1814) IV. 340: \"He [Moses] ordained our government to be what, by a strained expression, may be termed a Theocracy\", translating  {{lang|grc|\u1f61\u03c2 \u03b4'\u1f04\u03bd \u03c4\u03af\u03c2 \u03b5\u1f34\u03c0\u03bf\u03b9, \u03b2\u03b9\u03b1\u03c3\u03ac\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 \u03c4\u1f78\u03bd \u03bb\u03cc\u03b3\u03bf\u03bd, \u03b8\u03b5\u03bf\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03af\u03b1\u03bd}}\n</ref>\nTaken literally, ''theocracy'' means rule by God or gods and refers primarily to an internal \"rule of the heart\", especially in its biblical application. The common, generic use of the term, as defined above in terms of rule by a church or analogous religious leadership, would be more accurately described as an ''ecclesiocracy''.<ref>Stephen Palmquist, [http://www.hkbu.edu.hk/~ppp/bth ''Biblical Theocracy: A vision of the biblical foundations for a Christian political philosophy''] (Hong Kong: Philopsychy Press, 1993), introduced these more precise uses of the terms in arguing that theocracy (in this pure sense) is the only political system defended in the Bible. While Palmquist defends theocracy in this pure form as a viable (though \"non-political\") political system, he warns that what normally goes by this name is actually ecclesiocracy, the most dangerous of all political systems.</ref>\n\nIn a pure theocracy, the civil leader is believed to have a personal connection with the civilization's religion or belief. For example, [[Moses]] led the Israelites, and [[Muhammad]] led the early Muslims. There is a fine line between the tendency of appointing religious characters to run the state and having a religious-based government. According to the Holy Books, Prophet Joseph was offered an essential governmental role just because he was trustworthy, wise and knowledgeable (Quran 12: 54\u201355). As a result of the Prophet Joseph's knowledge and also due to his ethical and genuine efforts during a critical economic situation, the whole nation was rescued from a seven-year drought (Quran 12: 47\u201348).\n\nWhen religions have a \"holy book\", it is used as a direct message from God. Law proclaimed by the ruler is also considered a divine revelation, and hence the law of God. As to the Prophet Muhammad ruling, \"The first thirteen of the Prophet's twenty-three year career went on totally apolitical and non-violent. This attitude partly changed only after he had to flee from Mecca to Medina.This ''hijra'', or migration, would be a turning point in the Prophet's mission and would mark the very beginning of the Muslim calendar. Yet the Prophet did not establish a theocracy in Medina. Instead of a polity defined solely by Islam, he founded a territorial polity based on religious pluralism. This is evident in a document called the \u2019[[Constitution of Medina|Charter of Medina]]\u2019, which the Prophet signed with the leaders of the other community in the city.\"<ref>Akyol, Mustafa. ''Islam without extremes'' W.W.Norton, 2013, p. 56</ref>\n\nAccording to the Quran, Prophets were not after power or material resources. For example in surah 26 verses (109, 127, 145, 164, 180), the Koran repeatedly quotes from Prophets, [[Noah]], [[Hud (prophet)|Hud]], [[Salih]], [[Lut]], and [[Shu'aib]] that: \"I do not ask you for it any payment; my payment is only from the Lord of the worlds.\" While, in theocracy many aspects of the holy book are overshadowed by material powers. Due to be considered divine, the regime entitles itself to interpret verses to its own benefit and use them out of context for its political aims. An ecclesiocracy, on the other hand, is a situation where the religious leaders assume a leading role in the state, but do not claim that they are instruments of divine revelation.  For example, the [[prince-bishop]]s of the European Middle Ages, where the bishop was also the temporal ruler. Such a state may use the administrative hierarchy of the religion for its own administration, or it may have two \"arms\"\u2014administrators and clergy\u2014but with the state administrative hierarchy subordinate to the religious hierarchy. The papacy in the [[Papal States]] occupied a middle ground between theocracy and ecclesiocracy, since the pope did not claim he was a prophet who received revelation from God and translated it into civil law.\n\nReligiously endorsed monarchies fall between these two poles, according to the relative strengths of the religious and political organs.\n\nTheocracy is distinguished from other, secular forms of government that have a [[state religion]], or are influenced by theological or moral concepts, and monarchies held \"[[By the Grace of God]]\". In the most common usage of the term, some civil rulers are leaders of the dominant religion (e.g., the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] emperor as patron and defender of the official Church); the government proclaims it rules on behalf of God or a higher power, as specified by the local religion, and divine approval of government institutions and laws. These characteristics apply also to a [[Caesaropapism|caesaropapist]] regime. The Byzantine Empire however was not theocratic since the patriarch answered to the emperor, not vice versa; similarly in Tudor England the crown forced the church to break away from Rome so the royal (and, especially later, parliamentary) power could assume full control of the now [[Anglican Church|Anglican]] hierarchy and confiscate most church property and income.\n\nSecular governments can also co-exist with a state religion or delegate some aspects of civil law to religious communities. For example, in [[Israel]] marriage is governed by officially recognized religious bodies who each provide marriage services for their respected adherents, yet no form of civil marriage (free of religion, for atheists, for example) exists nor marriage by non-recognized minority religions.\n\n==Current theocracies==\n\n===Christian theocracies===\n{{Further|Christian state}}\n\n====Holy See (Vatican City)====\n{{Main|Politics of Vatican City}}\nFollowing the [[Capture of Rome]] on 20 September 1870, the [[Papal States]] including Rome with the [[Holy See|Vatican]] were annexed by the [[Kingdom of Italy]].

This in turn derives from [[:wikt:\u03b8\u03b5\u03cc\u03c2|\u03b8\u03b5\u03cc\u03c2]] (''theos''), meaning \"god\", and [[:wikt:\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03ad\u03c9|\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03ad\u03c9]] (''krateo''), meaning \"to rule\". Thus the meaning of the word in Greek was \"rule by god(s)\" or human [[incarnation]](s) of god(s).\n\nThe term was initially coined by [[Flavius Josephus]] in the first century A.D. to describe the characteristic government of the [[Jew]]s. Josephus argued that while mankind had developed many forms of rule, most could be subsumed under the following  three types: [[monarchy]], [[oligarchy]], and [[democracy]]. The government of the Jews, however, was unique. Josephus offered the term \"theocracy\" to describe this polity, ordained by Moses, in which God is sovereign and his word is law.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/2849/2849-h/2849-h.htm|title=Against Apion by Flavius Josephus, Book II, Chapter 17|work=gutenberg.org|date=October 2001}}</ref>\n\nJosephus' definition was widely accepted until the [[The Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] era, when the term started to collect more universalistic{{Clarify|date=April 2010}} and negative [[connotation]]s, especially in [[Hegel]]'s hands. The first recorded English use was in 1622, with the meaning \"sacerdotal government under divine inspiration\" (as in Biblical Israel before the rise of kings); the meaning \"priestly or religious body wielding political and civil power\" is recorded from 1825.\n\n==Synopsis==\n{{tone|section|date=December 2016}}\nIn some religions, the ruler, usually a king, was regarded as the chosen favorite of God (or gods) and could not be questioned, sometimes even being the descendant of or a god in their own right. Today, there is also a form of government where clerics have the power and the supreme leader could not be questioned in action. From the perspective of the theocratic government, \"God himself is recognized as the head\" of the state,<ref>[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/14568a.htm Catholic Encyclopedia] \"A form of civil government in which God himself is recognized as the head.\"</ref> hence the term ''theocracy'', from the [[Koine Greek]] {{lang|grc|\u03b8\u03b5\u03bf\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03af\u03b1}} \"rule of God\", a term used by [[Josephus]] for the [[kingdoms of Israel and Judah]].<ref>English form the 17th century (''[[OED]]'').\nThe Greek term is explicitly coined by Josephus and isn't attested elsewhere in Ancient Greek; Josephus marks it as a [[nonce word|nonce]] coinage by calling it a \"strained expression\".\nW. Whiston tr. [[Josephus]], ''Against Apion'' ii. \u00a717 (1814) IV. 340: \"He [Moses] ordained our government to be what, by a strained expression, may be termed a Theocracy\", translating  {{lang|grc|\u1f61\u03c2 \u03b4'\u1f04\u03bd \u03c4\u03af\u03c2 \u03b5\u1f34\u03c0\u03bf\u03b9, \u03b2\u03b9\u03b1\u03c3\u03ac\u03bc\u03b5\u03bd\u03bf\u03c2 \u03c4\u1f78\u03bd \u03bb\u03cc\u03b3\u03bf\u03bd, \u03b8\u03b5\u03bf\u03ba\u03c1\u03b1\u03c4\u03af\u03b1\u03bd}}\n</ref>\nTaken literally, ''theocracy'' means rule by God or gods and refers primarily to an internal \"rule of the heart\", especially in its biblical application. The common, generic use of the term, as defined above in terms of rule by a church or analogous religious leadership, would be more accurately described as an ''ecclesiocracy''.<ref>Stephen Palmquist, [http://www.hkbu.edu.hk/~ppp/bth ''Biblical Theocracy: A vision of the biblical foundations for a Christian political philosophy''] (Hong Kong: Philopsychy Press, 1993), introduced these more precise uses of the terms in arguing that theocracy (in this pure sense) is the only political system defended in the Bible. While Palmquist defends theocracy in this pure form as a viable (though \"non-political\") political system, he warns that what normally goes by this name is actually ecclesiocracy, the most dangerous of all political systems.</ref>\n\nIn a pure theocracy, the civil leader is believed to have a personal connection with the civilization's religion or belief. For example, [[Moses]] led the Israelites, and [[Muhammad]] led the early Muslims. There is a fine line between the tendency of appointing religious characters to run the state and having a religious-based government. According to the Holy Books, Prophet Joseph was offered an essential governmental role just because he was trustworthy, wise and knowledgeable (Quran 12: 54\u201355). As a result of the Prophet Joseph's knowledge and also due to his ethical and genuine efforts during a critical economic situation, the whole nation was rescued from a seven-year drought (Quran 12: 47\u201348).\n\nWhen religions have a \"holy book\", it is used as a direct message from God. Law proclaimed by the ruler is also considered a divine revelation, and hence the law of God. As to the Prophet Muhammad ruling, \"The first thirteen of the Prophet's twenty-three year career went on totally apolitical and non-violent. This attitude partly changed only after he had to flee from Mecca to Medina.This ''hijra'', or migration, would be a turning point in the Prophet's mission and would mark the very beginning of the Muslim calendar. Yet the Prophet did not establish a theocracy in Medina. Instead of a polity defined solely by Islam, he founded a territorial polity based on religious pluralism. This is evident in a document called the \u2019[[Constitution of Medina|Charter of Medina]]\u2019, which the Prophet signed with the leaders of the other community in the city.\"<ref>Akyol, Mustafa. ''Islam without extremes'' W.W.Norton, 2013, p. 56</ref>\n\nAccording to the Quran, Prophets were not after power or material resources. For example in surah 26 verses (109, 127, 145, 164, 180), the Koran repeatedly quotes from Prophets, [[Noah]], [[Hud (prophet)|Hud]], [[Salih]], [[Lut]], and [[Shu'aib]] that: \"I do not ask you for it any payment; my payment is only from the Lord of the worlds.\" While, in theocracy many aspects of the holy book are overshadowed by material powers. Due to be considered divine, the regime entitles itself to interpret verses to its own benefit and use them out of context for its political aims. An ecclesiocracy, on the other hand, is a situation where the religious leaders assume a leading role in the state, but do not claim that they are instruments of divine revelation.  For example, the [[prince-bishop]]s of the European Middle Ages, where the bishop was also the temporal ruler. Such a state may use the administrative hierarchy of the religion for its own administration, or it may have two \"arms\"\u2014administrators and clergy\u2014but with the state administrative hierarchy subordinate to the religious hierarchy. The papacy in the [[Papal States]] occupied a middle ground between theocracy and ecclesiocracy, since the pope did not claim he was a prophet who received revelation from God and translated it into civil law.\n\nReligiously endorsed monarchies fall between these two poles, according to the relative strengths of the religious and political organs.\n\nTheocracy is distinguished from other, secular forms of government that have a [[state religion]], or are influenced by theological or moral concepts, and monarchies held \"[[By the Grace of God]]\". In the most common usage of the term, some civil rulers are leaders of the dominant religion (e.g., the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] emperor as patron and defender of the official Church); the government proclaims it rules on behalf of God or a higher power, as specified by the local religion, and divine approval of government institutions and laws. These characteristics apply also to a [[Caesaropapism|caesaropapist]] regime. The Byzantine Empire however was not theocratic since the patriarch answered to the emperor, not vice versa; similarly in Tudor England the crown forced the church to break away from Rome so the royal (and, especially later, parliamentary) power could assume full control of the now [[Anglican Church|Anglican]] hierarchy and confiscate most church property and income.\n\nSecular governments can also co-exist with a state religion or delegate some aspects of civil law to religious communities. For example, in [[Israel]] marriage is governed by officially recognized religious bodies who each provide marriage services for their respected adherents, yet no form of civil marriage (free of religion, for atheists, for example) exists nor marriage by non-recognized minority religions.\n\n==Current theocracies==\n\n===Christian theocracies===\n{{Further|Christian state}}\n\n====Holy See (Vatican City)====\n{{Main|Politics of Vatican City}}\nFollowing the [[Capture of Rome]] on 20 September 1870, the [[Papal States]] including Rome with the [[Holy See|Vatican]] were annexed by the [[Kingdom of Italy]].

Pakistan first adopted the title under the constitution of 1956. Mauritania adopted it on 28 November 1958.

Despite having similar names the countries differ greatly in their governments and laws.\n\nThe term \"Islamic republic\" has come to mean several different things, some contradictory to others. To some Muslim religious leaders in the Middle East and Africa who advocate it, an Islamic republic is a [[Sovereign state|state]] under a particular [[Islam]]ic [[form of government]]. They see it as a compromise between a purely Islamic [[caliphate]] and secular nationalism and [[republicanism]]. In their conception of the Islamic republic, the [[penal code]] of the state is required to be compatible with some or all laws of [[Sharia]], and the state may not be a monarchy, as many Middle Eastern states are presently.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}\n\n===Central Tibetan Administration===\nThe [[Central Tibetan Administration]], colloquially known as the Tibetan government in exile, is a [[Tibetan exile]] organisation with a state-like internal structure.

However, from the first historical Emperor on, this was largely ceremonial and tradition quickly established it as a posthumous dignity, like the Roman institution. The situation before [[Qin Shi Huang Di]] is less clear.\n\nThe [[Shang dynasty]] essentially functioned as a theocracy, declaring the ruling family the sons of heaven and calling the chief sky god [[Shangdi]] after a word for their deceased ancestors.<ref name=wibla/> After their overthrow by the [[Zhou dynasty|Zhou]], the royal clan of Shang were not eliminated but instead moved to a ceremonial capital where they were charged to continue the performance of their rituals.\n\nThe titles combined by [[Shi Huangdi]] to form his new title of [[Chinese emperor|emperor]] were originally applied to [[Three Sovereigns|god-like beings]] who ordered the heavens and earth and to [[Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors|culture heroes]] credited with the invention of [[Five Grains|agriculture]], [[traditional Chinese clothing|clothing]], [[traditional Chinese music|music]], [[Chinese astrology|astrology]], &c.

The term properly refers to the head of a thearchy (a kingdom of gods), but the more accurate \"theocrat\" carries associations of a strong priesthood that would be generally inaccurate in describing imperial China. Others reserve the use of \"thearch\" to describe the legendary figures of Chinese prehistory while continuing to use \"emperor\" to describe historical rulers.<ref name=wibla>Nadeau, Randall L.

However the United States took control in 1848 and would not accept polygamy.

When the Mormons arrived in the valley of the [[Great Salt Lake]] in 1847, the [[Great Basin]] was still a part of Mexico and had no secular government. As a result, [[Brigham Young]] administered the region both spiritually and temporally through the highly organized and centralized [[Melchizedek priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|Melchizedek Priesthood]]. This original organization was based upon a concept called [[theodemocracy]], a governmental system combining Biblical theocracy with mid-19th-century American political ideals.<ref>John G.

The Mormons also petitioned Congress to have Deseret admitted into the Union as a state. However, under the [[Compromise of 1850]], [[Utah Territory]] was created and Brigham Young was appointed governor. In this situation, Young still stood as head of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) as well as Utah's secular government.\n\nAfter the abortive [[Utah War]] of 1857\u20131858, the replacement of Young by an outside Federal Territorial Governor, intense federal prosecution of LDS Church leaders, and the eventual resolution of controversies regarding [[plural marriage]], and accession by Utah to statehood, the apparent temporal aspects of LDS [[theodemocracy]] receded markedly.<ref>Luke Perry and Christopher Cronin, ''Mormons in American Politics: From Persecution to Power'' (ABC-CLIO, 2012)</ref>\n\n===Persia===\nDuring the [[Achaemenid Empire]], [[Zoroastrianism]] was the state religion and included formalized worship. The Persian kings were known to be pious Zoroastrians and also ruled with a Zoroastrian form of law called ''[[asha]]''. However, [[Cyrus the Great]], who founded the empire, avoided imposing the Zoroastrian faith on the inhabitants of conquered territory. Cyrus's kindness towards Jews has been cited{{citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=January 2016}} as sparking Zoroastrian influence on Judaism.\n\nUnder the Seleucids, Zoroastrianism became autonomous. During the [[Sassanid]] period, the [[Zoroastrian calendar]] was reformed, image-use in worship was banned, [[Fire Temples]] were increasingly built and intolerance towards other faiths prevailed.<ref>[http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/zoroastrian/history/persia_1.shtml Zoroastrianism under Persian rule] retrieved 5 January 2012</ref>\n\n===Florence under Savonarola===\nThe short reign (1494\u20131498) of [[Girolamo Savonarola]], a [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] priest, over the city of Florence had features of a theocracy.
