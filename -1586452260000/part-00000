In vitro studies have shown that nitazoxanide inhibits thymidylate synthase (TS), dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), and glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase (GARFT), all folate-dependent enzymes involved in the de novo biosynthesis of thymidine and purine nucleotides. Nitazoxanide is transported into cells by both the reduced folate carrier and membrane folate binding protein transport systems. Once in the cell, nitazoxanide is converted to polyglutamate forms by the enzyme folylpolyglutamate synthetase. The polyglutamate forms are retained in cells and are inhibitors of TS and GARFT. Polyglutamation is a time- and concentration-dependent process that occurs in tumor cells and, to a lesser extent, in normal tissues. Polyglutamated metabolites have an increased intracellular half-life resulting in prolonged drug action in malignant cells.\n\n<ref name=\"DrugBank Nitazoxanide\">{{cite web|title=Nitazoxanide|url=http://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00507|website=DrugBank|publisher=University of Alberta|accessdate=3 January 2016}}</ref>\n\n{{cite journal | pmid =  26258002 | doi=10.1007/s40475-015-0051-1 | pmc=4523694 | volume=2 | title=Drug Resistance in the Microaerophilic Parasite Giardia lamblia | year=2015 | journal=Curr Trop Med Rep | pages=128\u2013135  | last1 = Leitsch | first1 = D}} is a review that covers its antiprotazoal pharmacodynamics\n-->\n\n===Pharmacokinetics===\nFollowing oral administration, nitazoxanide is rapidly [[hydrolyzed]] to the pharmacologically active metabolite, [[tizoxanide]], which is 99% protein bound.<ref name=\"FDA Nitazoxanide\" /><ref name=\"pmid17888524\">{{cite journal |author=Korba BE |title=Nitazoxanide, tizoxanide and other thiazolides are potent inhibitors of hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus replication |journal=Antiviral Res. |volume=77 |issue=1 |pages=56\u201363 |date=January 2008 |pmid=17888524 |doi=10.1016/j.antiviral.2007.08.005 |name-list-format=vanc|author2=Montero AB |author3=Farrar K |display-authors=3 |last4=Gaye |first4=Karen |last5=Mukerjee |first5=Sampa |last6=Ayers |first6=Marc S. |last7=Rossignol |first7=Jean-Fran\u00e7ois}}</ref> Tizoxanide is then [[glucuronide conjugation|glucuronide conjugated]] into the active metabolite, [[tizoxanide glucuronide]].<ref name=\"FDA Nitazoxanide\" />  Peak plasma concentrations of the metabolites tizoxanide and tizoxanide glucuronide are observed 1\u20134&nbsp;hours after oral administration of nitazoxanide, whereas nitazoxanide itself is not detected in [[blood plasma]].<ref name=\"FDA Nitazoxanide\" />\n\nRoughly {{frac|2|3}} of an oral dose of nitazoxanide is excreted as its metabolites in feces, while the remainder of the dose excreted in urine.<ref name=\"FDA Nitazoxanide\" /> Tizoxanide is excreted in the [[urine]], [[bile]] and [[feces]].<ref name=\"FDA Nitazoxanide\" /> Tizoxanide glucuronide is excreted in urine and bile.<ref name=\"FDA Nitazoxanide\" />\n\n== Chemistry ==\n{{expand section|date=January 2016}}\nNitazoxanide is the prototype member of the [[thiazolide]]s, which is a [[drug class]] of structurally-related broad-spectrum [[antiparasitic]] compounds.<ref name=\"Thiazolides\" /> Nitazoxanide is a light yellow crystalline powder. It is poorly soluble in ethanol and practically insoluble in water.\n\n== History ==\nNitazoxanide was originally discovered in the 1980s by [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Rossignol]] at the [[Pasteur Institute]]. Initial studies demonstrated activity versus [[tapeworms]]. ''In vitro'' studies demonstrated much broader activity. Dr. Rossignol co-founded Romark Laboratories, with the goal of bringing nitazoxanide to market as an anti-parasitic drug. Initial studies in the USA were conducted in collaboration with Unimed Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ([[Marietta, GA]]) and focused on development of the drug for treatment of [[cryptosporidiosis]] in [[AIDS]]. Controlled trials began shortly after the advent of effective anti-retroviral therapies. The trials were abandoned due to poor enrollment and the FDA rejected an application based on uncontrolled studies.\n\nSubsequently, Romark launched a series of controlled trials. A placebo-controlled study of nitazoxanide in cryptosporidiosis demonstrated significant clinical improvement in adults and children with mild illness. Among malnourished children in Zambia with chronic cryptosporidiosis, a three-day course of therapy led to clinical and parasitologic improvement and improved survival. In Zambia and in a study conducted in Mexico, nitazoxanide was not successful in the treatment of cryptosporidiosis in advanced infection with human immunodeficiency virus at the doses used. However, it was effective in patients with higher CD4 counts. In treatment of giardiasis, nitazoxanide was superior to placebo and comparable to [[metronidazole]]. Nitazoxanide was successful in the treatment of metronidazole-resistant giardiasis. Studies have suggested efficacy in the treatment of [[cyclosporiasis]], [[isosporiasis]], and [[amebiasis]].<ref>{{cite journal | journal = Am. J. Trop. Med.

In vitro studies have shown that nitazoxanide inhibits thymidylate synthase (TS), dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), and glycinamide ribonucleotide formyltransferase (GARFT), all folate-dependent enzymes involved in the de novo biosynthesis of thymidine and purine nucleotides. Nitazoxanide is transported into cells by both the reduced folate carrier and membrane folate binding protein transport systems. Once in the cell, nitazoxanide is converted to polyglutamate forms by the enzyme folylpolyglutamate synthetase. The polyglutamate forms are retained in cells and are inhibitors of TS and GARFT. Polyglutamation is a time- and concentration-dependent process that occurs in tumor cells and, to a lesser extent, in normal tissues. Polyglutamated metabolites have an increased intracellular half-life resulting in prolonged drug action in malignant cells.\n\n<ref name=\"DrugBank Nitazoxanide\">{{cite web|title=Nitazoxanide|url=http://www.drugbank.ca/drugs/DB00507|website=DrugBank|publisher=University of Alberta|accessdate=3 January 2016}}</ref>\n\n{{cite journal | pmid =  26258002 | doi=10.1007/s40475-015-0051-1 | pmc=4523694 | volume=2 | title=Drug Resistance in the Microaerophilic Parasite Giardia lamblia | year=2015 | journal=Curr Trop Med Rep | pages=128\u2013135  | last1 = Leitsch | first1 = D}} is a review that covers its antiprotazoal pharmacodynamics\n-->\n\n===Pharmacokinetics===\nFollowing oral administration, nitazoxanide is rapidly [[hydrolyzed]] to the pharmacologically active metabolite, [[tizoxanide]], which is 99% protein bound.<ref name=\"FDA Nitazoxanide\" /><ref name=\"pmid17888524\">{{cite journal |author=Korba BE |title=Nitazoxanide, tizoxanide and other thiazolides are potent inhibitors of hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus replication |journal=Antiviral Res. |volume=77 |issue=1 |pages=56\u201363 |date=January 2008 |pmid=17888524 |doi=10.1016/j.antiviral.2007.08.005 |name-list-format=vanc|author2=Montero AB |author3=Farrar K |display-authors=3 |last4=Gaye |first4=Karen |last5=Mukerjee |first5=Sampa |last6=Ayers |first6=Marc S. |last7=Rossignol |first7=Jean-Fran\u00e7ois}}</ref> Tizoxanide is then [[glucuronide conjugation|glucuronide conjugated]] into the active metabolite, [[tizoxanide glucuronide]].<ref name=\"FDA Nitazoxanide\" />  Peak plasma concentrations of the metabolites tizoxanide and tizoxanide glucuronide are observed 1\u20134&nbsp;hours after oral administration of nitazoxanide, whereas nitazoxanide itself is not detected in [[blood plasma]].<ref name=\"FDA Nitazoxanide\" />\n\nRoughly {{frac|2|3}} of an oral dose of nitazoxanide is excreted as its metabolites in feces, while the remainder of the dose excreted in urine.<ref name=\"FDA Nitazoxanide\" /> Tizoxanide is excreted in the [[urine]], [[bile]] and [[feces]].<ref name=\"FDA Nitazoxanide\" /> Tizoxanide glucuronide is excreted in urine and bile.<ref name=\"FDA Nitazoxanide\" />\n\n== Chemistry ==\n{{expand section|date=January 2016}}\nNitazoxanide is the prototype member of the [[thiazolide]]s, which is a [[drug class]] of structurally-related broad-spectrum [[antiparasitic]] compounds.<ref name=\"Thiazolides\" /> Nitazoxanide is a light yellow crystalline powder. It is poorly soluble in ethanol and practically insoluble in water.\n\n== History ==\nNitazoxanide was originally discovered in the 1980s by [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Rossignol]] at the [[Pasteur Institute]]. Initial studies demonstrated activity versus [[tapeworms]]. ''In vitro'' studies demonstrated much broader activity. Dr. Rossignol co-founded Romark Laboratories, with the goal of bringing nitazoxanide to market as an anti-parasitic drug. Initial studies in the USA were conducted in collaboration with Unimed Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ([[Marietta, GA]]) and focused on development of the drug for treatment of [[cryptosporidiosis]] in [[AIDS]]. Controlled trials began shortly after the advent of effective anti-retroviral therapies. The trials were abandoned due to poor enrollment and the FDA rejected an application based on uncontrolled studies.\n\nSubsequently, Romark launched a series of controlled trials. A placebo-controlled study of nitazoxanide in cryptosporidiosis demonstrated significant clinical improvement in adults and children with mild illness. Among malnourished children in Zambia with chronic cryptosporidiosis, a three-day course of therapy led to clinical and parasitologic improvement and improved survival. In Zambia and in a study conducted in Mexico, nitazoxanide was not successful in the treatment of cryptosporidiosis in advanced infection with human immunodeficiency virus at the doses used. However, it was effective in patients with higher CD4 counts. In treatment of giardiasis, nitazoxanide was superior to placebo and comparable to [[metronidazole]]. Nitazoxanide was successful in the treatment of metronidazole-resistant giardiasis. Studies have suggested efficacy in the treatment of [[cyclosporiasis]], [[isosporiasis]], and [[amebiasis]].<ref>{{cite journal | journal = Am. J. Trop. Med.

After Tushan Rongrong knew his idea, she told him that Honghong often went to Shuangsheng Mountain(\u53cc\u751f\u5cf0) on that festival.

Yuechu was distressed after knowing the fact and left Tushan for 50 years.\n\nIn these years, the friendship between human beings and spirits became worse than before. Yuechu experienced something important and became much stronger. He became the host of Yiqi Taoist League. At that time, people still thought Tushan fox spirits often killed people. Only Yuechu and Wangquan Fugui knew the fact: the black fox spirits(\u9ed1\u72d0) broke the peace. Yuechu and Fugui talked about how to let people belive the fact.

Jin's Chunzhi Yangyan was so strong that Tushan couldn't fight against him. However, Dongfang Yuechu asked Tushan Honghong to use her hand through his heart and he kissed her immediately. Honghong got strong spirit power from that and finally Jin failed. After the attack. Yuechu used his diluted blood to wash her hands so that she was not afraid of Chunzhi Yangyan. Yuechu loved Honghong so much that he was ready to confess to her on Double Seventh Festival which day that Niulang and Zhinu meet each other every year in Chinese traditional legend. After Tushan Rongrong knew his idea, she told him that Honghong often went to Shuangsheng Mountain(\u53cc\u751f\u5cf0) on that festival. When Yuechu arrived there, he just saw Honghong walked into an icy cave and sat in front of a dead little Taoist body. Honghong knew he was nearby and said something to him on propose. Then Yuechu knew that she and Rongrong were caught by two Taoists when they were young. But while the elder one sleeping, the little one wanted to save these two fox spirits. Honghong remaineded of something that be told by an elder fox spirit, she just thought the little one would kill her so she uesd her hand through his heart but she understood his real motivation at that moment. The little Taoist told her his thoughts and died soon. Honghong was very guilty and it left a shadow in her heart. She couldn't do what she wanted even couldn't love others. Yuechu was distressed after knowing the fact and left Tushan for 50 years.\n\nIn these years, the friendship between human beings and spirits became worse than before. Yuechu experienced something important and became much stronger. He became the host of Yiqi Taoist League. At that time, people still thought Tushan fox spirits often killed people. Only Yuechu and Wangquan Fugui knew the fact: the black fox spirits(\u9ed1\u72d0) broke the peace. Yuechu and Fugui talked about how to let people belive the fact. Yuechu pretended to believe black fox spirits' plan and fight Honghong in order to lure black fox spirit to show up. But he knew the end clearly, it's a bet of his whole life. After fighting, the Queen of balck fox spirit showed up. Honghong finally realized his real idea and was moved. Yuechu left Tushan 50 years ago just wanted to achieve her dream, a dream about the peace between humans and spirits.

The Queen really wanted to get it, she seriously hurt Yuechu. But the magic item had been become Yuechu and Honghong's magic item of love continuation in their heart.

It was the first daytime soap opera produced by [[Aaron Spelling]], the chief of [[Spelling Television]] (Spelling had also produced several primetime soap operas, and was the executive producer of the 1991 film ''[[Soapdish]]'', a satirical look at daytime soap operas). Jonathan Levin, one of the show's consulting producers, commented on the change that a new soap opera brings to the lineup, and the tough process of a viewer getting to know a new soap: \"It is very difficult to change the loyalty of the daytime viewer, and we\u2019re talking about shows that have been on for 30 years. That's one of the reasons we\u2019re targeting young viewers \u2014 they\u2019re the most available and the most flexible in their viewing habits.\"<ref>[http://boards.soapoperanetwork.com/index.php?showtopic=25459&st=0 Levin comment]</ref>\n\nIn the process of making the show, Spelling liked the idea of naming it ''Never Say Goodbye'', as suggested by [[Viacom (2005\u2013present)|Viacom]] chairman [[Sumner Redstone]] during a dinner with Spelling, but later tests proved that the viewers were more drawn to the title ''Sunset Beach''. Upon its premiere, ''Sunset Beach'' was made part of the NBC Daytime programming block.  At first, the show was given a one-year deal, with 255 episodes to produce. The show was renewed again for another year, and then picked up in six-month intervals for its final year in 1999.\n\nBefore getting cancelled, the show was renewed twice, but it failed to grab the show's audience. Through its short existence, ''Sunset Beach'' remained in the daytime [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]] basement. However, during the ''Shockwave'' storyline, it received its best ratings and showed signs that it might move off the bottom. This spike proved to be brief and was not sustained.<ref>[[List of US daytime soap opera ratings|Nielsen Ratings]], ''Info on Nielsen Ratings''</ref>\n\n==Cast and crew==\n{{Main|List of Sunset Beach characters|List of Sunset Beach crew|List of Sunset Beach cast members}}\n[[Image:Cast01.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Cast circa 1997.<br />First row: Cole, Annie, Tim<br />Second row: Caitlin, Mark, Meg, Eddie<br />Third row: Tiffany, Ricardo, Paula, Ben, Vanessa, Michael, Sean]]\nWhen the show first aired, it started with 21 contract characters, of which 7 left the show during its first year and a half. The first actress to leave the series was [[Adrienne Frantz]]. Her character was recast with Jennifer Banko Stewart, but the change didn't work out, resulting in the character eventually being written out. [[Kelly Hu]] left the show in June 1997, due to her character not mixing well with the others. By the end of the year, when [[Meg Bennett]] took over as a new head writer, [[Leigh Taylor-Young]] and [[Laura Harring]] also left the series, followed by the exit of [[Nick Stabile]], whose character was written out in a serial killer storyline. [[Elizabeth Alley]] had a short stint in the role of Melinda Fall. The final original character to be written off was Eddie Connors, played by [[Peter Barton (actor)|Peter Barton]], who exited in mid-1998.\n\nThe remaining 14 original characters stayed on the show until its end, and three of those characters were recast during the three-year run. The first recast happened soon after the show started airing. The role of [[Cole Deschanel]] a male jewel thief, initially played by [[Ashley Hamilton]], was recast with [[Eddie Cibrian]]. In mid-1998, following contract disputes, [[Vanessa Dorman]] vacated the role of Cole's girlfriend, later wife [[Caitlin Deschanel]], and [[Kam Heskin]] was cast. The final recast was a temporary one. When [[Susan Ward]] left for a while to film a movie, [[Sydney Penny]] stepped in to replace her, with Ward later returning to play the character for the show's final few weeks. Shortly after the show premiered, [[Dominique Jennings]], [[V. P. Oliver]], and [[Russell Curry]] joined the cast. Oliver was let go in December 1997, and his character, Jimmy Harrison, was recast with a younger actor, [[Jeffery Wood]]. Both Jennings and Wood were written off by March 1999, exactly two years after the introduction of their characters.\n\nThe exits of many characters opened the doors to the introduction of new ones. [[Carol Potter (actress)|Carol Potter]] and [[John Martin (actor)|John Martin]], who had been recurring during the show's first year, were promoted to contract status, and the expansion of Meg's family also included the arrival of her sister [[Sara Cummings|Sara]]. The role was first played by then-unknown actress [[Lauren Woodland]], but she was fired two weeks later and replaced by [[Shawn Batten]], who played the role for the remainder of the series. Aside from Meg's family, [[Ricardo Torres (Sunset Beach)|Ricardo]] got his family expanded, including the introduction of his mother Carmen ([[Margarita Cordova]]), brother Antonio ([[Nick Kiriazis]]), and the sudden reappearance of his sister Maria ([[Christina Chambers]]), Ben Evans' presumed dead wife.\n\nThe teen scene was revived in 1998, when Bette's daughter Emily ([[Cristi Harris]]) arrived in town and fell in love with Sean, prompting Amy (Krissy Carlson) and Brad ([[Michael Strickland (actor)|Michael Strickland]]) to intervene. The final teen cast was Leo Deschanel, Cole's brother ([[David Mathiessen]]), but he was quickly written out. A long-time legend and Cole's father, A.J. Deschanel, was also cast in the form of [[Gordon Thomson (actor)|Gordon Thomson]], and a female jewel thief named Francesca ([[Lisa Guerrero]]) was added to the cast in mid-1998. However, Guerrero was written out in early 1999 since her character was killed by Gregory.\n\nIn 1999, the show cast only three contract roles, the first two being in March, when [[Tracy Melchior|Tracy Lindsey Melchior]] and [[Chase Parker]] stunned the soap with their sudden arrival in town. The final role to be cast on the show was the one played by [[Sean Kanan]] in late August. Things changed at the end of the year, when fan favorite [[Eddie Cibrian]] left the show to pursue a career in primetime. Several other cast members, including a few original ones, considered leaving, but the show's cancellation came before they could make a decision.\n\nDuring its three-year run, ''Sunset Beach'' was executive produced by [[Aaron Spelling]], [[E. Duke Vincent]], and [[Gary Tomlin]]. However, the head writing history was much different. [[Robert Guza Jr.]] was the first head writer (and also a co-creator), but he exited the show on October 21, 1997, when [[Meg Bennett]], who had been serving as Associate Head Writer was promoted as head writer as of October 22. Four months after being the sole head writer, Bennett received a co-head writer in the form of [[Christopher Whitesell]], on January 8, 1998. Bennett was dismissed during the summer of 1998 and her final episode aired October 5, 1998. She was replaced by [[Margaret DePriest]], who stayed with the show until its cancellation.\n\n==Storylines==\nStorylines in its nearly three-year run ranged from the traditional to the [[supernatural]]. One of the first storylines concerned an Internet romance. Kansas farm girl [[Meg Cummings]] discovered her fianc\u00e9, [[Tim Truman (Sunset Beach)|Tim Truman]], cheating on her on their wedding day. Meg had been talking online with SB, a man who lived in Sunset Beach, California. And after catching Tim with her maid of honor, Meg fled to Sunset Beach in search of SB, who turned out to be wealthy, widowed businessman [[Ben Evans (Sunset Beach)|Ben Evans]].\n\n{{quotation|When the moon rises early, just as the Santa Ana winds kicks up out of nowhere, and the sun is just dropping out of sight, whoever you meet at the far side of the pier, is who you're destined to be with. [[Elaine Stevens]] ''(the legend of Sunset Beach)''<ref name=\"TV.com\">{{cite news| title= Sunset Beach Season 1 Episode 1 |publisher=[[TV.com]]|accessdate=2008-06-16|url=http://www.tv.com/sunset-beach/episode-001/episode/299451/trivia.html#notes Legend of SuBe}}</ref>}}The first year of the show revolved around Meg's pursuit of Ben (including her briefly breaking into his house, stealing a journal she found there, and dressing up in his late wife's clothes), who was initially not interested in her, and the gradual development of a romance between them. A side plot showed the antagonistic relationship between Meg and [[Annie Douglas Richards|Annie Douglas]], Ben's longtime best friend. Meg hated Annie for being close to Ben and wanted to cut her out of his life; Annie hated Meg out of jealousy for her developing romance with Ben. Their problems reached a head with a physical fight in a hot tub. Meg's ex-fianc\u00e9 Tim Truman followed her to Sunset Beach to win her back, and ended up becoming Annie's ally and almost love interest. Once Meg and Annie had overcome their differences, Meg soon had a new problem when she began to suspect Ben was a murderer, although this plot line was developed to lead up to the Terror Island storyline. After the Terror Island/Derek storyline (see below) none of the issues raised were ever mentioned again.\n\nMeg and Ben became one of the show's first couples, along with jewel thief [[Cole Deschanel]] and local heiress [[Caitlin Richards Deschanel|Caitlin Richards]]. Cole slept with and impregnated both Caitlin and Caitlin's unhappy alcoholic mother [[Olivia Richards|Olivia]]. Olivia and her fiendish ex-husband, [[Gregory Richards|Gregory]], planned to steal Caitlin's baby and pass it off as Olivia's (telling Caitlin her baby had died) in order to break up Caitlin's relationship with Cole, who her parents disapproved of because of his criminal past. Caitlin lost the child in a car accident when she found out about her parents' horrible plan, and planned to fake the rest of her pregnancy and adopt a baby to pass off as her own, as she was worried her inability to have children (caused by the accident) would cause problems in her marriage to Cole. She enlisted the help of Annie, who was secretly trying to break up Olivia and Gregory, due to a term in her father's will that stated she would only get her inheritance if she wed Gregory (her father's way of breaking up his marriage to Olivia, who he had been having an affair with) Annie drugged Olivia and stole her baby, telling her the baby had been stillborn. Caitlin (unknowingly) raised her baby half-brother (who was also her step-son, having been fathered by her husband) until a grief-stricken Olivia discovered the truth. Olivia was eventually reunited with her son.\n\nWhen the show began, it was the only soap on the air featuring Asian-American characters, though they were written off before the end of the first year. The show also had daytime television's only African-American villainess, [[Virginia Harrison]], who schemed to break up [[lifeguard]] [[Michael Bourne]] and reporter [[Vanessa Hart]] so she could have Michael for herself.\n\n===Prominent storylines===\nIn one of the most outrageous storylines on the show, Virginia drugged Vanessa and, using a [[turkey baster]] and some stolen sperm, impregnated her with the child of [[Tyus Robinson]], to make it appear Vanessa had been unfaithful to Michael, who was [[Infertility|sterile]].\n\nThe show was known for other outrageous storylines, such as ''Terror Island'' in which several of the show's main characters were stranded on an island with a masked serial killer (whose costume bore a close resemblance to that of the killer from ''[[Scream (film series)|Scream]]'') intent on killing them, especially Meg. A handful of characters were killed by the maniac, mostly minor characters introduced as serial killer-fodder, but also one lead character, young runaway made good [[Mark Wolper]]. In his dying moments Mark pulled off the killer's mask and audiences were stunned to see Ben's face behind it. As it turned out, Ben had an evil twin, [[Derek Evans (Sunset Beach)|Derek]], who plagued Ben and Meg's lives off and on for the rest of the run of the show. Derek was killed after being shot in a struggle with Ben during the show's final weeks, following a long storyline where Derek kidnapped and impersonated his twin for months, sleeping with Ben's wife [[Maria Torres|Maria]] (having previously also slept with Meg).\n\n[[Maria Torres Evans]], who had wed Ben when she was still a teenager and he was barely in his twenties, had disappeared and been presumed drowned after a boating accident that took place some years prior to the start of the show. Ben was haunted by the terrible secret that he had caught her in bed with Derek (it was later revealed that Derek\u2014who had impersonated Ben to Maria, who was unaware Ben had a twin\u2014had not slept with Maria, as she had stabbed him with scissors when he tried to rape her). Ben's guilt and grief over Maria caused a shadow over his relationship with Meg from the beginning, which worsened when an amnesiac Maria came back from the dead at Ben and Meg's October 1998 wedding. Ben and Maria grew closer while he helped her to regain her memory, and once she did, Ben flip flopped between the two women for much of the rest of the show's run. During the show's last year a strange woman, Tess, turned up on his doorstep with a son she claimed was Ben and Maria's. After a positive paternity test they raised the child, [[Benjy Evans|Benjy]], together, causing even more problems for Meg, who left Ben and briefly started dating her sister's boyfriend, [[Casey Mitchum|Casey]]. Derek (who was also wrongfully presumed dead) returned to kidnap Ben again, and it was revealed he and Tess were Benjy's parents.\n\nAnother outrageous storyline was the earthquake/[[tsunami]] story, in which Sunset Beach was struck by a massive earthquake, trapping many characters \u2013 most of them each other's rival \u2013 together in life and death situations. While half the cast battled the disaster on land, the rest of the cast was on a pleasure cruise aboard a ship that was overturned \u2013 \u00e0 la ''[[The Poseidon Adventure (novel)|The Poseidon Adventure]]'' \u2013 by a tsunami created by the earthquake. This storyline was in many ways similar to the plot of ''The Poseidon Adventure''.\n\nThe tsunami storyline proved so popular that two weeks' worth of episodes were compiled and turned into an hour-long show that was included on NBC's lineup for one night in August 1998. The show took a [[supernatural]] turn for a while with some cursed jewels, stolen from a religious icon, that turned those who'd touched them into shriveled mummies. The story culminated on [[Christmas Eve]] with the return of the jewels to the Madonna just in time to prevent the deaths of several key characters.\n\nThe show also featured two murder mysteries in its run. The first was the murder of Annie's father Del Douglas by [[Elaine Stevens]]. Del had kidnapped Cole as a baby and convinced Elaine the child was dead). The second murder mystery involved the death of seductress and jewel thief [[Francesca Vargas]], whom just about everyone in town wanted dead. The twist in the Who Shot Francesca storyline and the killer was main antagonist character [[Gregory Richards]].\n\n===Cancellation===\nThe show was cancelled just before the third anniversary of its original air date. Most of the main characters were given happy endings.<ref>[http://www.tv.com/sunset-beach/episode-755/episode/469509/recap.html Final Episode Recap]</ref> Ben and Meg and Michael and Vanessa married in a double wedding. Casey and Sara got engaged, Cole and Caitlin were happy in their marriage, and Olivia was happily raising her children alone. Maria gave Ben a divorce so he could marry Meg and met a new man, Ross English. Maria also adopted Benjy, the little boy she had regarded as her own, and she and Ben planned to raise him together. The 'baddies' all got their comeuppances. Derek was accidentally shot and killed by Ben; his accomplice Tess went to jail, as did Gregory Richards (Francesca's real killer). Tim Truman, who though not a villain spent most of the three years causing problems for Ben and Meg, was murdered by Derek. Virginia remained in a mental hospital of the criminally insane, while reformed Annie also got a happy ending, finding love with relatively new character Jude.\n\nIn a twist ending, Meg appeared to wake up in [[Kansas]] and realize that the entire three years in Sunset Beach had been a dream \u2013 and the characters from the show were actually her friends and family in Kansas (a reference to ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'').{{Original research inline|date=August 2010}} However, at the last minute, Meg woke up in Sunset Beach and was in bed with Ben, the day after their wedding. Probably the dream was poking fun at how many writers use the sloppy ending of \"it was all a dream\" to bring a story to a close, as was done in stories such as ''[[Alice in Wonderland]]'' or more aptly, evoking the dream (9th) season of the prime-time soap, ''[[Dallas (1978 TV series)|Dallas]]''.\n\nThe show gained a cult following in the UK, doing especially well in the ratings for [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]], with some universities holding ''Sunset Beach'' parties where students would go dressed as their favorite character. Channel 5 tried to save the show when its cancellation was announced, offering partially to fund it and trying to get other networks involved, as had happened previously with ''[[Baywatch]]'', but NBC was not interested. It did buy NBC's other soap opera, ''[[Days of Our Lives]]'', to air in ''Sunset Beach''\u2019s place, even running promos during ''Sunset Beach''\u2019s final week, but the show failed to catch on and Channel 5 dropped ''Days'' approximately a year later.\n\nTo date, ''Sunset Beach'' is the last regularly-scheduled NBC network program to air at 12:00&nbsp;p.m. Some NBC affiliates did not air ''Sunset Beach'' at its scheduled time due to the affiliates' longstanding practice of airing local newscasts or other syndicated programming in the noon hour; this resulted in some affiliates airing the show in a different spot on their schedule while others did not air it at all. In some media markets (especially in [[WKBD-TV|Detroit]] and [[KTXH|Houston]], where [[Post-Newsweek Stations]], the owner of [[WDIV-TV|WDIV]] and [[KPRC-TV]] at the time, preempted it for its entire run), ''Sunset Beach'' aired on affiliates of other networks or independent stations. In most markets that did air the show at its regular time, its second half-hour went up against the first half-hour of ''[[The Young and the Restless]]'' on CBS and ''[[Port Charles]]'' on ABC. After the series ended, NBC returned the 12:00&nbsp;p.m. time slot to its affiliates.\n\n==International broadcasting==\n{{cleanup section|date=October 2011}}\n\nIn Australia, ''Sunset Beach'' aired on [[Network Ten]] from 1998 to 2000 in an early morning time slot.\n\nIn Bulgaria, ''Sunset Beach'' aired on [[Nova Television (Bulgaria)|Nova Television]] weekdays in 2001-2004 (all episodes), and on [[CBS Drama]] since January 2015.\n\nIn Canada, ''Sunset Beach'' aired at 3:00PM on independent station [[CHCH]] in Hamilton, Ontario; the show was broadcast the same day as NBC.<ref>{{Cite pressrelease|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19970103004725/http://www.chch.com/press/current/sunset.htm |title=\"Sunset Beach\" a sizzling new daytime drama from Aaron Spelling, premieres January 6, 1997 on CHCH-TV |date=December 24, 1996 |archivedate=January 3, 1997 |accessdate=March 16, 2012 |publisher=Niagara Television Limited|url=http://www.chch.com/press/current/sunset.htm }}</ref>\n\nIn Croatia, ''Sunset Beach'' aired on [[Croatian radio television|HRT1]] (all episodes) weekdays at 6.30pm from September 1998 to May 2001.\n\nIn France, ''Sunset Beach'' aired on [[Fox life|TF1]].\n\nIn Ireland, ''Sunset Beach'' aired on [[TV3 (Ireland)|TV3]] weekdays at 2.30pm from 20 September 1998 to August 2001 - all 755 episodes aired.

The show follows the loves and lives of the people living in the Orange County coastal area named Sunset Beach, on the coast of [[California]]. Although there is a town in California called [[Sunset Beach, California|Sunset Beach]], the show's beach scenes were shot on nearby [[Seal Beach]]. The show was co-produced by NBC and [[Spelling Television]].\n\n''Sunset Beach'' won two [[Daytime Emmy Awards]] and was nominated another eleven times. The show also received twenty-two nominations for various other awards.<ref>\"[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0118484/awards Emmy Awards]\" ''NBC'', URL last accessed 2008-06-16</ref>\n\n==Conception and development==\n''Sunset Beach'' was created in 1996, in an attempt to rebuild the [[NBC Daytime]] lineup and target the younger audience. It was the first daytime soap opera produced by [[Aaron Spelling]], the chief of [[Spelling Television]] (Spelling had also produced several primetime soap operas, and was the executive producer of the 1991 film ''[[Soapdish]]'', a satirical look at daytime soap operas). Jonathan Levin, one of the show's consulting producers, commented on the change that a new soap opera brings to the lineup, and the tough process of a viewer getting to know a new soap: \"It is very difficult to change the loyalty of the daytime viewer, and we\u2019re talking about shows that have been on for 30 years. That's one of the reasons we\u2019re targeting young viewers \u2014 they\u2019re the most available and the most flexible in their viewing habits.\"<ref>[http://boards.soapoperanetwork.com/index.php?showtopic=25459&st=0 Levin comment]</ref>\n\nIn the process of making the show, Spelling liked the idea of naming it ''Never Say Goodbye'', as suggested by [[Viacom (2005\u2013present)|Viacom]] chairman [[Sumner Redstone]] during a dinner with Spelling, but later tests proved that the viewers were more drawn to the title ''Sunset Beach''. Upon its premiere, ''Sunset Beach'' was made part of the NBC Daytime programming block.  At first, the show was given a one-year deal, with 255 episodes to produce. The show was renewed again for another year, and then picked up in six-month intervals for its final year in 1999.\n\nBefore getting cancelled, the show was renewed twice, but it failed to grab the show's audience. Through its short existence, ''Sunset Beach'' remained in the daytime [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]] basement. However, during the ''Shockwave'' storyline, it received its best ratings and showed signs that it might move off the bottom. This spike proved to be brief and was not sustained.<ref>[[List of US daytime soap opera ratings|Nielsen Ratings]], ''Info on Nielsen Ratings''</ref>\n\n==Cast and crew==\n{{Main|List of Sunset Beach characters|List of Sunset Beach crew|List of Sunset Beach cast members}}\n[[Image:Cast01.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Cast circa 1997.<br />First row: Cole, Annie, Tim<br />Second row: Caitlin, Mark, Meg, Eddie<br />Third row: Tiffany, Ricardo, Paula, Ben, Vanessa, Michael, Sean]]\nWhen the show first aired, it started with 21 contract characters, of which 7 left the show during its first year and a half. The first actress to leave the series was [[Adrienne Frantz]]. Her character was recast with Jennifer Banko Stewart, but the change didn't work out, resulting in the character eventually being written out. [[Kelly Hu]] left the show in June 1997, due to her character not mixing well with the others. By the end of the year, when [[Meg Bennett]] took over as a new head writer, [[Leigh Taylor-Young]] and [[Laura Harring]] also left the series, followed by the exit of [[Nick Stabile]], whose character was written out in a serial killer storyline. [[Elizabeth Alley]] had a short stint in the role of Melinda Fall. The final original character to be written off was Eddie Connors, played by [[Peter Barton (actor)|Peter Barton]], who exited in mid-1998.\n\nThe remaining 14 original characters stayed on the show until its end, and three of those characters were recast during the three-year run. The first recast happened soon after the show started airing. The role of [[Cole Deschanel]] a male jewel thief, initially played by [[Ashley Hamilton]], was recast with [[Eddie Cibrian]]. In mid-1998, following contract disputes, [[Vanessa Dorman]] vacated the role of Cole's girlfriend, later wife [[Caitlin Deschanel]], and [[Kam Heskin]] was cast. The final recast was a temporary one. When [[Susan Ward]] left for a while to film a movie, [[Sydney Penny]] stepped in to replace her, with Ward later returning to play the character for the show's final few weeks. Shortly after the show premiered, [[Dominique Jennings]], [[V. P. Oliver]], and [[Russell Curry]] joined the cast. Oliver was let go in December 1997, and his character, Jimmy Harrison, was recast with a younger actor, [[Jeffery Wood]]. Both Jennings and Wood were written off by March 1999, exactly two years after the introduction of their characters.\n\nThe exits of many characters opened the doors to the introduction of new ones. [[Carol Potter (actress)|Carol Potter]] and [[John Martin (actor)|John Martin]], who had been recurring during the show's first year, were promoted to contract status, and the expansion of Meg's family also included the arrival of her sister [[Sara Cummings|Sara]]. The role was first played by then-unknown actress [[Lauren Woodland]], but she was fired two weeks later and replaced by [[Shawn Batten]], who played the role for the remainder of the series. Aside from Meg's family, [[Ricardo Torres (Sunset Beach)|Ricardo]] got his family expanded, including the introduction of his mother Carmen ([[Margarita Cordova]]), brother Antonio ([[Nick Kiriazis]]), and the sudden reappearance of his sister Maria ([[Christina Chambers]]), Ben Evans' presumed dead wife.\n\nThe teen scene was revived in 1998, when Bette's daughter Emily ([[Cristi Harris]]) arrived in town and fell in love with Sean, prompting Amy (Krissy Carlson) and Brad ([[Michael Strickland (actor)|Michael Strickland]]) to intervene. The final teen cast was Leo Deschanel, Cole's brother ([[David Mathiessen]]), but he was quickly written out. A long-time legend and Cole's father, A.J. Deschanel, was also cast in the form of [[Gordon Thomson (actor)|Gordon Thomson]], and a female jewel thief named Francesca ([[Lisa Guerrero]]) was added to the cast in mid-1998. However, Guerrero was written out in early 1999 since her character was killed by Gregory.\n\nIn 1999, the show cast only three contract roles, the first two being in March, when [[Tracy Melchior|Tracy Lindsey Melchior]] and [[Chase Parker]] stunned the soap with their sudden arrival in town. The final role to be cast on the show was the one played by [[Sean Kanan]] in late August. Things changed at the end of the year, when fan favorite [[Eddie Cibrian]] left the show to pursue a career in primetime. Several other cast members, including a few original ones, considered leaving, but the show's cancellation came before they could make a decision.\n\nDuring its three-year run, ''Sunset Beach'' was executive produced by [[Aaron Spelling]], [[E. Duke Vincent]], and [[Gary Tomlin]]. However, the head writing history was much different. [[Robert Guza Jr.]] was the first head writer (and also a co-creator), but he exited the show on October 21, 1997, when [[Meg Bennett]], who had been serving as Associate Head Writer was promoted as head writer as of October 22. Four months after being the sole head writer, Bennett received a co-head writer in the form of [[Christopher Whitesell]], on January 8, 1998. Bennett was dismissed during the summer of 1998 and her final episode aired October 5, 1998. She was replaced by [[Margaret DePriest]], who stayed with the show until its cancellation.\n\n==Storylines==\nStorylines in its nearly three-year run ranged from the traditional to the [[supernatural]]. One of the first storylines concerned an Internet romance. Kansas farm girl [[Meg Cummings]] discovered her fianc\u00e9, [[Tim Truman (Sunset Beach)|Tim Truman]], cheating on her on their wedding day. Meg had been talking online with SB, a man who lived in Sunset Beach, California. And after catching Tim with her maid of honor, Meg fled to Sunset Beach in search of SB, who turned out to be wealthy, widowed businessman [[Ben Evans (Sunset Beach)|Ben Evans]].\n\n{{quotation|When the moon rises early, just as the Santa Ana winds kicks up out of nowhere, and the sun is just dropping out of sight, whoever you meet at the far side of the pier, is who you're destined to be with.

A side plot showed the antagonistic relationship between Meg and [[Annie Douglas Richards|Annie Douglas]], Ben's longtime best friend. Meg hated Annie for being close to Ben and wanted to cut her out of his life; Annie hated Meg out of jealousy for her developing romance with Ben. Their problems reached a head with a physical fight in a hot tub. Meg's ex-fianc\u00e9 Tim Truman followed her to Sunset Beach to win her back, and ended up becoming Annie's ally and almost love interest. Once Meg and Annie had overcome their differences, Meg soon had a new problem when she began to suspect Ben was a murderer, although this plot line was developed to lead up to the Terror Island storyline. After the Terror Island/Derek storyline (see below) none of the issues raised were ever mentioned again.\n\nMeg and Ben became one of the show's first couples, along with jewel thief [[Cole Deschanel]] and local heiress [[Caitlin Richards Deschanel|Caitlin Richards]]. Cole slept with and impregnated both Caitlin and Caitlin's unhappy alcoholic mother [[Olivia Richards|Olivia]]. Olivia and her fiendish ex-husband, [[Gregory Richards|Gregory]], planned to steal Caitlin's baby and pass it off as Olivia's (telling Caitlin her baby had died) in order to break up Caitlin's relationship with Cole, who her parents disapproved of because of his criminal past. Caitlin lost the child in a car accident when she found out about her parents' horrible plan, and planned to fake the rest of her pregnancy and adopt a baby to pass off as her own, as she was worried her inability to have children (caused by the accident) would cause problems in her marriage to Cole. She enlisted the help of Annie, who was secretly trying to break up Olivia and Gregory, due to a term in her father's will that stated she would only get her inheritance if she wed Gregory (her father's way of breaking up his marriage to Olivia, who he had been having an affair with) Annie drugged Olivia and stole her baby, telling her the baby had been stillborn. Caitlin (unknowingly) raised her baby half-brother (who was also her step-son, having been fathered by her husband) until a grief-stricken Olivia discovered the truth. Olivia was eventually reunited with her son.\n\nWhen the show began, it was the only soap on the air featuring Asian-American characters, though they were written off before the end of the first year. The show also had daytime television's only African-American villainess, [[Virginia Harrison]], who schemed to break up [[lifeguard]] [[Michael Bourne]] and reporter [[Vanessa Hart]] so she could have Michael for herself.\n\n===Prominent storylines===\nIn one of the most outrageous storylines on the show, Virginia drugged Vanessa and, using a [[turkey baster]] and some stolen sperm, impregnated her with the child of [[Tyus Robinson]], to make it appear Vanessa had been unfaithful to Michael, who was [[Infertility|sterile]].\n\nThe show was known for other outrageous storylines, such as ''Terror Island'' in which several of the show's main characters were stranded on an island with a masked serial killer (whose costume bore a close resemblance to that of the killer from ''[[Scream (film series)|Scream]]'') intent on killing them, especially Meg. A handful of characters were killed by the maniac, mostly minor characters introduced as serial killer-fodder, but also one lead character, young runaway made good [[Mark Wolper]]. In his dying moments Mark pulled off the killer's mask and audiences were stunned to see Ben's face behind it. As it turned out, Ben had an evil twin, [[Derek Evans (Sunset Beach)|Derek]], who plagued Ben and Meg's lives off and on for the rest of the run of the show. Derek was killed after being shot in a struggle with Ben during the show's final weeks, following a long storyline where Derek kidnapped and impersonated his twin for months, sleeping with Ben's wife [[Maria Torres|Maria]] (having previously also slept with Meg).\n\n[[Maria Torres Evans]], who had wed Ben when she was still a teenager and he was barely in his twenties, had disappeared and been presumed drowned after a boating accident that took place some years prior to the start of the show. Ben was haunted by the terrible secret that he had caught her in bed with Derek (it was later revealed that Derek\u2014who had impersonated Ben to Maria, who was unaware Ben had a twin\u2014had not slept with Maria, as she had stabbed him with scissors when he tried to rape her). Ben's guilt and grief over Maria caused a shadow over his relationship with Meg from the beginning, which worsened when an amnesiac Maria came back from the dead at Ben and Meg's October 1998 wedding. Ben and Maria grew closer while he helped her to regain her memory, and once she did, Ben flip flopped between the two women for much of the rest of the show's run. During the show's last year a strange woman, Tess, turned up on his doorstep with a son she claimed was Ben and Maria's. After a positive paternity test they raised the child, [[Benjy Evans|Benjy]], together, causing even more problems for Meg, who left Ben and briefly started dating her sister's boyfriend, [[Casey Mitchum|Casey]]. Derek (who was also wrongfully presumed dead) returned to kidnap Ben again, and it was revealed he and Tess were Benjy's parents.\n\nAnother outrageous storyline was the earthquake/[[tsunami]] story, in which Sunset Beach was struck by a massive earthquake, trapping many characters \u2013 most of them each other's rival \u2013 together in life and death situations. While half the cast battled the disaster on land, the rest of the cast was on a pleasure cruise aboard a ship that was overturned \u2013 \u00e0 la ''[[The Poseidon Adventure (novel)|The Poseidon Adventure]]'' \u2013 by a tsunami created by the earthquake. This storyline was in many ways similar to the plot of ''The Poseidon Adventure''.\n\nThe tsunami storyline proved so popular that two weeks' worth of episodes were compiled and turned into an hour-long show that was included on NBC's lineup for one night in August 1998. The show took a [[supernatural]] turn for a while with some cursed jewels, stolen from a religious icon, that turned those who'd touched them into shriveled mummies. The story culminated on [[Christmas Eve]] with the return of the jewels to the Madonna just in time to prevent the deaths of several key characters.\n\nThe show also featured two murder mysteries in its run. The first was the murder of Annie's father Del Douglas by [[Elaine Stevens]]. Del had kidnapped Cole as a baby and convinced Elaine the child was dead). The second murder mystery involved the death of seductress and jewel thief [[Francesca Vargas]], whom just about everyone in town wanted dead. The twist in the Who Shot Francesca storyline and the killer was main antagonist character [[Gregory Richards]].\n\n===Cancellation===\nThe show was cancelled just before the third anniversary of its original air date. Most of the main characters were given happy endings.<ref>[http://www.tv.com/sunset-beach/episode-755/episode/469509/recap.html Final Episode Recap]</ref> Ben and Meg and Michael and Vanessa married in a double wedding. Casey and Sara got engaged, Cole and Caitlin were happy in their marriage, and Olivia was happily raising her children alone. Maria gave Ben a divorce so he could marry Meg and met a new man, Ross English. Maria also adopted Benjy, the little boy she had regarded as her own, and she and Ben planned to raise him together. The 'baddies' all got their comeuppances. Derek was accidentally shot and killed by Ben; his accomplice Tess went to jail, as did Gregory Richards (Francesca's real killer). Tim Truman, who though not a villain spent most of the three years causing problems for Ben and Meg, was murdered by Derek. Virginia remained in a mental hospital of the criminally insane, while reformed Annie also got a happy ending, finding love with relatively new character Jude.\n\nIn a twist ending, Meg appeared to wake up in [[Kansas]] and realize that the entire three years in Sunset Beach had been a dream \u2013 and the characters from the show were actually her friends and family in Kansas (a reference to ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|The Wizard of Oz]]'').{{Original research inline|date=August 2010}} However, at the last minute, Meg woke up in Sunset Beach and was in bed with Ben, the day after their wedding. Probably the dream was poking fun at how many writers use the sloppy ending of \"it was all a dream\" to bring a story to a close, as was done in stories such as ''[[Alice in Wonderland]]'' or more aptly, evoking the dream (9th) season of the prime-time soap, ''[[Dallas (1978 TV series)|Dallas]]''.\n\nThe show gained a cult following in the UK, doing especially well in the ratings for [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]], with some universities holding ''Sunset Beach'' parties where students would go dressed as their favorite character. Channel 5 tried to save the show when its cancellation was announced, offering partially to fund it and trying to get other networks involved, as had happened previously with ''[[Baywatch]]'', but NBC was not interested. It did buy NBC's other soap opera, ''[[Days of Our Lives]]'', to air in ''Sunset Beach''\u2019s place, even running promos during ''Sunset Beach''\u2019s final week, but the show failed to catch on and Channel 5 dropped ''Days'' approximately a year later.\n\nTo date, ''Sunset Beach'' is the last regularly-scheduled NBC network program to air at 12:00&nbsp;p.m. Some NBC affiliates did not air ''Sunset Beach'' at its scheduled time due to the affiliates' longstanding practice of airing local newscasts or other syndicated programming in the noon hour; this resulted in some affiliates airing the show in a different spot on their schedule while others did not air it at all. In some media markets (especially in [[WKBD-TV|Detroit]] and [[KTXH|Houston]], where [[Post-Newsweek Stations]], the owner of [[WDIV-TV|WDIV]] and [[KPRC-TV]] at the time, preempted it for its entire run), ''Sunset Beach'' aired on affiliates of other networks or independent stations. In most markets that did air the show at its regular time, its second half-hour went up against the first half-hour of ''[[The Young and the Restless]]'' on CBS and ''[[Port Charles]]'' on ABC. After the series ended, NBC returned the 12:00&nbsp;p.m. time slot to its affiliates.\n\n==International broadcasting==\n{{cleanup section|date=October 2011}}\n\nIn Australia, ''Sunset Beach'' aired on [[Network Ten]] from 1998 to 2000 in an early morning time slot.\n\nIn Bulgaria, ''Sunset Beach'' aired on [[Nova Television (Bulgaria)|Nova Television]] weekdays in 2001-2004 (all episodes), and on [[CBS Drama]] since January 2015.\n\nIn Canada, ''Sunset Beach'' aired at 3:00PM on independent station [[CHCH]] in Hamilton, Ontario; the show was broadcast the same day as NBC.<ref>{{Cite pressrelease|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19970103004725/http://www.chch.com/press/current/sunset.htm |title=\"Sunset Beach\" a sizzling new daytime drama from Aaron Spelling, premieres January 6, 1997 on CHCH-TV |date=December 24, 1996 |archivedate=January 3, 1997 |accessdate=March 16, 2012 |publisher=Niagara Television Limited|url=http://www.chch.com/press/current/sunset.htm }}</ref>\n\nIn Croatia, ''Sunset Beach'' aired on [[Croatian radio television|HRT1]] (all episodes) weekdays at 6.30pm from September 1998 to May 2001.\n\nIn France, ''Sunset Beach'' aired on [[Fox life|TF1]].\n\nIn Ireland, ''Sunset Beach'' aired on [[TV3 (Ireland)|TV3]] weekdays at 2.30pm from 20 September 1998 to August 2001 - all 755 episodes aired.

Sara went on to develop a relationship with local lifeguard Casey Mitchum, and their relationship and her sibling rivalry with her sister (who at one point started an affair with Casey) made up the bulk of Sara's storylines, although she was also famous for her TV show-inspired fantasy sequences, which included spoofs of the opening titles for ''Friends'' and ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]''.\n\nOther notable guest appearances include [[Finola Hughes]] as Cole's ex-fianc\u00e9e Helena, [[Christopher Darden]] as Les Gordon, [[John O'Hurley]] as the host of ''Wheel of Misfortune'', [[Kim Alexis]] as a hotel maid, [[Jack Wagner (actor)|Jack Wagner]] as a thief named Jacques Dumont, and [[Barbara Mandrell]] as Casey's ill mother Alex Mitchum.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://www.facebook.com/pages/Sunset-Beach/103110746395508?fref=ts Sunset Beach] at [[Facebook]]\n*{{IMDb title|id=0118484|title=Sunset Beach}}\n*{{Tv.com show|sunset-beach|Sunset Beach}}\n*[https://sunsetbeachonline.com Sunset Beach Online - Website about the soap opera Sunset Beach ]\n*[http://antonio-gabi.xooit.com/index.php French forum about Antonio and Gabi's story \u2665 ]\n\n{{Sunset Beach (TV series)}}\n{{US daytime soaps}}\n{{Soap operas in the United Kingdom}}\n{{Aaron Spelling}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Sunset Beach (TV Series)}}\n[[Category:1997 American television series debuts]]\n[[Category:1999 American television series endings]]\n[[Category:1990s American drama television series]]\n[[Category:American television soap operas]]\n[[Category:English-language television programs]]\n[[Category:NBC original programming]]\n[[Category:Television series by Spelling Television]]\n[[Category:Television series by Universal Television]]\n[[Category:Television shows set in Orange County, California]]\n[[Category:NBC network soap operas]]\n", "name_user": "Deleu vasilii", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunset_Beach_(TV_series)"}

The main market forces that accelerated IPv4 address depletion included the rapidly growing number of Internet users, always-on devices, and mobile devices.\n\nThe anticipated shortage has been the driving factor in creating and adopting several new technologies, including [[network address translation]] (NAT), [[Classless Inter-Domain Routing]] (CIDR) in 1993, and IPv6 in 1998.<ref name=\"Murphy\"/> \n\nThe top-level exhaustion occurred on 31 January 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nro.net/news/ipv4-free-pool-depleted|title=Free Pool of IPv4 Address Space Depleted|last=Smith|first=Lucie|author2=Lipner, Ian|date=3 February 2011|publisher=[[Number Resource Organization]]|accessdate=3 February 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.icann.org/en/news/releases/release-03feb11-en.pdf |title=Available Pool of Unallocated IPv4 Internet Addresses Now Completely Emptied |publisher=ICANN |date=2011-02-03 |access-date=2016-09-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.icann.org/en/news/advisories/advisory-01feb11-en.pdf |title=Major Announcement Set on Dwindling Pool of Available IPv4 Internet Addresses |access-date=2016-09-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://mailman.nanog.org/pipermail/nanog/2011-February/032107.html |title=Five /8s allocated to RIRs \u2013 no unallocated IPv4 unicast /8s remain | author=ICANN, nanog mailing list}}</ref> All RIRs have exhausted their address pools, except those reserved for [[IPv6 transition]]; this occurred on 15 April 2011 for the Asia-Pacific ([[APNIC]]),<ref name=\"Huston\">{{cite web |last=Huston |first=Geoff |title=IPv4 Address Report, daily generated |url=http://www.potaroo.net/tools/ipv4/index.html |accessdate=16 January 2011}}</ref><ref name=\"APNIC\">{{cite web |url=http://www.apnic.net/publications/news/2011/delegation |title=Two /8s allocated to APNIC from IANA |publisher=APNIC |date=1 February 2010 |access-date=3 February 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807162237/http://www.apnic.net/publications/news/2011/delegation |archive-date=7 August 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref name=\"APNIC2\">{{cite web |url=http://www.apnic.net/publications/news/2011/final-8 |title=APNIC IPv4 Address Pool Reaches Final /8 |publisher=APNIC |date=15 April 2011 |access-date=15 April 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807162057/http://www.apnic.net/publications/news/2011/final-8 |archive-date=7 August 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> on 10 June 2014 for Latin America and the Caribbean ([[LACNIC]]),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nro.net/news/lacnic-enters-ipv4-exhaustion-phase|title=LACNIC Enters IPv4 Exhaustion Phase - The Number Resource Organization|publisher=|accessdate=10 September 2016}}</ref> on 24 September 2015 for North America ([[ARIN]]),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.arin.net/announcements/2015/20150924.html|title=ARIN IPv4 Free Pool Reaches Zero|publisher=American Registry for Internet Numbers|date=24 September 2015|accessdate=25 September 2015}}</ref> on 21 April 2017 for Africa ([[AfriNIC]]), and on 25 November 2019 for Europe, Middle East and Central Asia ([[RIPE NCC]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ripe.net/publications/news/about-ripe-ncc-and-ripe/the-ripe-ncc-has-run-out-of-ipv4-addresses|title=The RIPE NCC has run out of IPv4 Addresses|publisher=R\u00e9seaux IP Europ\u00e9ens Network Coordination Centre|date=25 November 2019|accessdate=25 November 2019}}</ref> These RIRs still allocate recovered addresses or addresses reserved for a special purpose. Individual ISPs still have pools of unassigned IP addresses, and could recycle addresses no longer needed by subscribers.\n\n==IP addressing==\nEvery node of an Internet Protocol (IP) network, such as a [[computer]], [[router (computing)|router]], or [[network printer]], is assigned an [[IP address]] for each network interface, used to locate and identify the node in communications with other nodes on the network. Internet Protocol version 4 provides 2<sup>32</sup> (4,294,967,296) addresses. However, large blocks of IPv4 addresses are reserved for special uses and are unavailable for public allocation.\n\nThe IPv4 addressing structure provides an insufficient number of publicly routable addresses to provide a distinct address to every Internet device or service. This problem has been mitigated for some time by changes in the address allocation and routing infrastructure of the Internet. The transition from [[classful network]] addressing to [[Classless Inter-Domain Routing]] delayed the exhaustion of addresses substantially. In addition, [[network address translation]] (NAT) permits Internet service providers and enterprises to masquerade private network address space with only one publicly routable IPv4 address on the Internet interface of a main Internet router, instead of allocating a public address to each network device.\n\n<ref></ref>==Address depletion==\nWhile the primary reason for IPv4 address exhaustion is insufficient capacity in the design of the original Internet infrastructure, several additional driving factors have aggravated the shortcomings. Each of them increased the demand on the limited supply of addresses, often in ways unanticipated by the original designers of the network.\n\n;Mobile devices: As IPv4 increasingly became the ''de facto'' standard for networked digital communication and the cost of embedding substantial computing power into hand-held devices dropped, mobile phones have become viable Internet hosts. New specifications of [[4G]] devices require IPv6 addressing.\n\n;Always-on connections: Throughout the 1990s, the predominant mode of consumer Internet access was [[Dial-up Internet access|telephone modem dial-up]]. The rapid increase in the number of the dial-up networks increased address consumption rates, although it was common that the modem pools, and as a result, the pool of assigned IP addresses, were shared amongst a large customer base. By 2007, however, [[broadband|broadband Internet access]] had begun to exceed 50% penetration in many markets.<ref>{{cite web|last=Ferguson |first=Tim |url=http://www.news.com/Broadband-adoption-passes-halfway-mark-in-U.S./2110-1034_3-6160422.html |title=Broadband adoption passes halfway mark in U.S. |publisher=CNET News.com |date=18 February 2007 |accessdate=10 November 2010}}</ref> Broadband connections are always active, as the gateway devices (routers, broadband modems) are rarely turned off, so that the address uptake by [[Internet service provider]]s continued at an accelerating pace.\n\n;Internet demographics: The developed world consists of hundreds of millions of households. In 1990, only a small fraction of these had Internet access. Just 15 years later, almost half of them had persistent broadband connections.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/1/pop/p25-1129.pdf |title=Projections of the Number of Households and Families in the United States: 1995 to 2010 |format=PDF |date=April 1996 |accessdate=10 November 2010}}</ref> The many new Internet users in countries such as China and India are also driving address exhaustion.\n\n;Inefficient address use: Organizations that obtained IP addresses in the 1980s were often allocated far more addresses than they actually required, because the initial [[classful network]] allocation method was inadequate to reflect reasonable usage. For example, large companies or universities were assigned class A address blocks with over 16&nbsp;million IPv4 addresses each, because the next smaller allocation unit, a class B block with 65,536 addresses, was too small for their intended deployments.\n\n:Many organizations continue to utilize public IP addresses for devices not accessible outside their local network. From a global address allocation viewpoint, this is inefficient in many cases, but scenarios exist where this is preferred in the organizational network implementation strategies.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\n:Due to inefficiencies caused by [[subnetwork|subnetting]], it is difficult to use all addresses in a block. The host-density ratio, as defined in RFC 3194, is a metric for utilization of IP address blocks, that is used in allocation policies.\n\n==Mitigation efforts==\nEfforts to delay address space exhaustion started with the recognition of the problem in the early 1990s, and the introduction of a number of stop-gap refinements to make the existing structure operate more efficiently, such as CIDR methods and strict usage-based allocation policies. \n\nThe [[Internet Engineering Task Force]] (IETF) created the Routing and Addressing Group (ROAD) in November 1991 to respond to the scalability problem caused by the [[classful network]] allocation system in place at the time.<ref>{{cite IETF |rfc=4632 |title=Classless Inter-domain Routing (CIDR): The Internet Address Assignment and Aggregation Plan}}</ref><ref name=\"Murphy\">{{cite book | title = IPv6 network administration |author1=Niall Richard Murphy |author2=David Malone | pages = xvii\u2013xix | publisher = O'Reilly Media, Inc. | year = 2005 | isbn = 0-596-00934-8 }}</ref> \n\nIPv6, the successor technology to IPv4, was designed to address this problem.

Nevertheless, customers are likely to require access to services on the IPv4 Internet. Several technologies have been developed for providing IPv4 service over an IPv6 access network.\n\nIn ISP-level IPv4 NAT, ISPs may implement IPv4 [[network address translation]] within their networks and assign private IPv4 addresses to customers. This approach may allow customers to keep using existing hardware. Some estimates for NAT argue that US ISPs have 5-10 times the number of IPs they need in order to service their existing customers.<ref name=\"TheWhir\">{{cite web |url=http://www.thewhir.com/blog/ipv4-stay-part-2-show-money |title=Why IPv4 is Here to Stay, Part 2: Show Me the Money |last1=Ramuglia |first1=Gabriel |date=16 February 2015 |website=The Web Host Industry Review  |access-date=27 February 2015}}</ref> This has been successfully implemented in some countries, e.g., Russia, where many broadband providers use [[carrier-grade NAT]], and offer publicly routable IPv4 address at an additional cost.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}\n\nHowever the allocation of private IPv4 addresses to customers may conflict with private IP allocations on the customer networks. Furthermore, some ISPs may have to divide their network into subnets to allow them to reuse private IPv4 addresses, complicating network administration. There are also concerns that features of consumer-grade NAT such as [[DMZ (computing)|DMZ]]s, [[STUN]], [[UPnP]] and [[application-level gateway]]s might not be available at the ISP level.  ISP-level NAT may result in multiple-level address translation which is likely to further complicate the use of technologies such as [[port forwarding]] used to run Internet [[Server (computing)|servers]] within private networks.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}\n\n[[NAT64]] translates IPv6 requests from clients to IPv4 requests. This avoids the need to provision any IPv4 addresses to clients and allows clients that only support IPv6 to access IPv4 resources. However this approach requires a DNS server with [[DNS64]] capability and cannot support IPv4-only client devices.\n\n[[DS-Lite]] (Dual-Stack Light) uses tunnels from the customer premises equipment to a network address translator at the ISP.<ref>RFC 6333 - Dual-Stack Lite Broadband Deployments Following IPv4 Exhaustion</ref> The consumer premises equipment encapsulates the IPv4 packets in an IPv6 wrapper and sends them to a host known as the ''AFTR element''. The AFTR element de-encapsulates the packets and performs network address translation before sending them to the public Internet. The NAT in the AFTR uses the IPv6 address of the client in its NAT mapping table. This means that different clients can use the same private IPv4 addresses, therefore avoiding the need for allocating private IPv4 IP addresses to customers or using multiple NATs.\n\n[[Address plus Port]] allows stateless sharing of public IP addresses based on TCP/UDP port numbers. Each node is allocated both an IPv4 address and a range of [[Port (computer networking)|port numbers]] to use. Other nodes may be allocated the same IPv4 address but a different range of ports. The technique avoids the need for stateful address translation mechanisms in the core of the network, thus leaving end users in control of their own address translation.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}\n\n==Long-term solution==\n[[IPv6 deployment|Deployment of IPv6]] is the standards-based solution to the IPv4 address shortage.<ref name=\"APNIC\"/> IPv6 is endorsed and implemented by all Internet technical standards bodies and network equipment vendors. It encompasses many design improvements, including the replacement of the 32-bit IPv4 address format with a 128-bit address which provides an addressing space without limitations for the foreseeable future. IPv6 has been in active production deployment since June 2006, after organized worldwide testing and evaluation in the [[6bone]] project ceased. Interoperability for hosts using only IPv4 protocols is implemented with a variety of [[IPv6 transition mechanisms]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of assigned /8 IPv4 address blocks]]\n* [[512K Day]] \u2013 an event in 2014, involving the exhaustion of the default allocation of hardware routing slots on many routers\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [//www.iana.org/assignments/ipv4-address-space/ipv4-address-space.xhtml Official current state of IPv4 /8 allocations, as maintained by IANA]\n* [//www.icann.org/en/news/announcements/announcement-2-10feb08-en.htm ICANN recovers Large Block of Internet Addresses (14.0.0.0/8)] 2008-02-10\n* [//www.icann.org/en/resources/policy/global-addressing/proposal-ipv4-report-29nov07-en.htm Global Policy Proposal for Remaining IPv4 Address Space \u2013 Background Report] 2008-09-08\n* [http://www.potaroo.net/tools/ipv4/ potaroo.net: IPv4 Address Report with countdown]\n* RIR IPv4 status: [//www.apnic.net/community/ipv4-exhaustion/graphical-information APNIC] [//www.ripe.net/internet-coordination/ipv4-exhaustion/ipv4-available-pool-graph RIPE]\n\n{{IPv6}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ipv4 Address Exhaustion}}\n[[Category:Hazards]]\n[[Category:Internet architecture]]\n[[Category:IPv4|Exhaustion]]\n[[Category:IP addresses|Exhaustion]]\n\n[[de:IPv6#Gr\u00fcnde f\u00fcr ein neues Internet-Protokoll]]\n", "text_old": "{{Short description|The depletion of the pool of unallocated IPv4 addresses.}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2015}}\n\n[[File:IPv4 exhaustion time line-en.svg|thumb|upright=2|IPv4 address exhaustion timeline]]\n\n'''IPv4 address exhaustion''' is the depletion of the pool of unallocated [[IPv4 address]]es.

The main market forces that accelerated IPv4 address depletion included the rapidly growing number of Internet users, always-on devices, and mobile devices.\n\nThe anticipated shortage has been the driving factor in creating and adopting several new technologies, including [[network address translation]] (NAT), [[Classless Inter-Domain Routing]] (CIDR) in 1993, and IPv6 in 1998.<ref name=\"Murphy\"/> \n\nThe top-level exhaustion occurred on 31 January 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nro.net/news/ipv4-free-pool-depleted|title=Free Pool of IPv4 Address Space Depleted|last=Smith|first=Lucie|author2=Lipner, Ian|date=3 February 2011|publisher=[[Number Resource Organization]]|accessdate=3 February 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.icann.org/en/news/releases/release-03feb11-en.pdf |title=Available Pool of Unallocated IPv4 Internet Addresses Now Completely Emptied |publisher=ICANN |date=2011-02-03 |access-date=2016-09-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.icann.org/en/news/advisories/advisory-01feb11-en.pdf |title=Major Announcement Set on Dwindling Pool of Available IPv4 Internet Addresses |access-date=2016-09-10}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://mailman.nanog.org/pipermail/nanog/2011-February/032107.html |title=Five /8s allocated to RIRs \u2013 no unallocated IPv4 unicast /8s remain | author=ICANN, nanog mailing list}}</ref> All RIRs have exhausted their address pools, except those reserved for [[IPv6 transition]]; this occurred on 15 April 2011 for the Asia-Pacific ([[APNIC]]),<ref name=\"Huston\">{{cite web |last=Huston |first=Geoff |title=IPv4 Address Report, daily generated |url=http://www.potaroo.net/tools/ipv4/index.html |accessdate=16 January 2011}}</ref><ref name=\"APNIC\">{{cite web |url=http://www.apnic.net/publications/news/2011/delegation |title=Two /8s allocated to APNIC from IANA |publisher=APNIC |date=1 February 2010 |access-date=3 February 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807162237/http://www.apnic.net/publications/news/2011/delegation |archive-date=7 August 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref name=\"APNIC2\">{{cite web |url=http://www.apnic.net/publications/news/2011/final-8 |title=APNIC IPv4 Address Pool Reaches Final /8 |publisher=APNIC |date=15 April 2011 |access-date=15 April 2011 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807162057/http://www.apnic.net/publications/news/2011/final-8 |archive-date=7 August 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> on 10 June 2014 for Latin America and the Caribbean ([[LACNIC]]),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nro.net/news/lacnic-enters-ipv4-exhaustion-phase|title=LACNIC Enters IPv4 Exhaustion Phase - The Number Resource Organization|publisher=|accessdate=10 September 2016}}</ref> on 24 September 2015 for North America ([[ARIN]]),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.arin.net/announcements/2015/20150924.html|title=ARIN IPv4 Free Pool Reaches Zero|publisher=American Registry for Internet Numbers|date=24 September 2015|accessdate=25 September 2015}}</ref> on 21 April 2017 for Africa ([[AfriNIC]]), and on 25 November 2019 for Europe, Middle East and Central Asia ([[RIPE NCC]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.ripe.net/publications/news/about-ripe-ncc-and-ripe/the-ripe-ncc-has-run-out-of-ipv4-addresses|title=The RIPE NCC has run out of IPv4 Addresses|publisher=R\u00e9seaux IP Europ\u00e9ens Network Coordination Centre|date=25 November 2019|accessdate=25 November 2019}}</ref> These RIRs still allocate recovered addresses or addresses reserved for a special purpose. Individual ISPs still have pools of unassigned IP addresses, and could recycle addresses no longer needed by subscribers.\n\n==IP addressing==\nEvery node of an Internet Protocol (IP) network, such as a [[computer]], [[router (computing)|router]], or [[network printer]], is assigned an [[IP address]] for each network interface, used to locate and identify the node in communications with other nodes on the network. Internet Protocol version 4 provides 2<sup>32</sup> (4,294,967,296) addresses. However, large blocks of IPv4 addresses are reserved for special uses and are unavailable for public allocation.\n\nThe IPv4 addressing structure provides an insufficient number of publicly routable addresses to provide a distinct address to every Internet device or service. This problem has been mitigated for some time by changes in the address allocation and routing infrastructure of the Internet. The transition from [[classful network]] addressing to [[Classless Inter-Domain Routing]] delayed the exhaustion of addresses substantially. In addition, [[network address translation]] (NAT) permits Internet service providers and enterprises to masquerade private network address space with only one publicly routable IPv4 address on the Internet interface of a main Internet router, instead of allocating a public address to each network device.\n\n==Address depletion==\nWhile the primary reason for IPv4 address exhaustion is insufficient capacity in the design of the original Internet infrastructure, several additional driving factors have aggravated the shortcomings. Each of them increased the demand on the limited supply of addresses, often in ways unanticipated by the original designers of the network.\n\n;Mobile devices: As IPv4 increasingly became the ''de facto'' standard for networked digital communication and the cost of embedding substantial computing power into hand-held devices dropped, mobile phones have become viable Internet hosts. New specifications of [[4G]] devices require IPv6 addressing.\n\n;Always-on connections: Throughout the 1990s, the predominant mode of consumer Internet access was [[Dial-up Internet access|telephone modem dial-up]]. The rapid increase in the number of the dial-up networks increased address consumption rates, although it was common that the modem pools, and as a result, the pool of assigned IP addresses, were shared amongst a large customer base. By 2007, however, [[broadband|broadband Internet access]] had begun to exceed 50% penetration in many markets.<ref>{{cite web|last=Ferguson |first=Tim |url=http://www.news.com/Broadband-adoption-passes-halfway-mark-in-U.S./2110-1034_3-6160422.html |title=Broadband adoption passes halfway mark in U.S. |publisher=CNET News.com |date=18 February 2007 |accessdate=10 November 2010}}</ref> Broadband connections are always active, as the gateway devices (routers, broadband modems) are rarely turned off, so that the address uptake by [[Internet service provider]]s continued at an accelerating pace.\n\n;Internet demographics: The developed world consists of hundreds of millions of households. In 1990, only a small fraction of these had Internet access. Just 15 years later, almost half of them had persistent broadband connections.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/1/pop/p25-1129.pdf |title=Projections of the Number of Households and Families in the United States: 1995 to 2010 |format=PDF |date=April 1996 |accessdate=10 November 2010}}</ref> The many new Internet users in countries such as China and India are also driving address exhaustion.\n\n;Inefficient address use: Organizations that obtained IP addresses in the 1980s were often allocated far more addresses than they actually required, because the initial [[classful network]] allocation method was inadequate to reflect reasonable usage. For example, large companies or universities were assigned class A address blocks with over 16&nbsp;million IPv4 addresses each, because the next smaller allocation unit, a class B block with 65,536 addresses, was too small for their intended deployments.\n\n:Many organizations continue to utilize public IP addresses for devices not accessible outside their local network. From a global address allocation viewpoint, this is inefficient in many cases, but scenarios exist where this is preferred in the organizational network implementation strategies.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}\n\n:Due to inefficiencies caused by [[subnetwork|subnetting]], it is difficult to use all addresses in a block. The host-density ratio, as defined in RFC 3194, is a metric for utilization of IP address blocks, that is used in allocation policies.\n\n==Mitigation efforts==\nEfforts to delay address space exhaustion started with the recognition of the problem in the early 1990s, and the introduction of a number of stop-gap refinements to make the existing structure operate more efficiently, such as CIDR methods and strict usage-based allocation policies. \n\nThe [[Internet Engineering Task Force]] (IETF) created the Routing and Addressing Group (ROAD) in November 1991 to respond to the scalability problem caused by the [[classful network]] allocation system in place at the time.<ref>{{cite IETF |rfc=4632 |title=Classless Inter-domain Routing (CIDR): The Internet Address Assignment and Aggregation Plan}}</ref><ref name=\"Murphy\">{{cite book | title = IPv6 network administration |author1=Niall Richard Murphy |author2=David Malone | pages = xvii\u2013xix | publisher = O'Reilly Media, Inc. | year = 2005 | isbn = 0-596-00934-8 }}</ref> \n\nIPv6, the successor technology to IPv4, was designed to address this problem.

Nevertheless, customers are likely to require access to services on the IPv4 Internet. Several technologies have been developed for providing IPv4 service over an IPv6 access network.\n\nIn ISP-level IPv4 NAT, ISPs may implement IPv4 [[network address translation]] within their networks and assign private IPv4 addresses to customers. This approach may allow customers to keep using existing hardware. Some estimates for NAT argue that US ISPs have 5-10 times the number of IPs they need in order to service their existing customers.<ref name=\"TheWhir\">{{cite web |url=http://www.thewhir.com/blog/ipv4-stay-part-2-show-money |title=Why IPv4 is Here to Stay, Part 2: Show Me the Money |last1=Ramuglia |first1=Gabriel |date=16 February 2015 |website=The Web Host Industry Review  |access-date=27 February 2015}}</ref> This has been successfully implemented in some countries, e.g., Russia, where many broadband providers use [[carrier-grade NAT]], and offer publicly routable IPv4 address at an additional cost.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}\n\nHowever the allocation of private IPv4 addresses to customers may conflict with private IP allocations on the customer networks. Furthermore, some ISPs may have to divide their network into subnets to allow them to reuse private IPv4 addresses, complicating network administration. There are also concerns that features of consumer-grade NAT such as [[DMZ (computing)|DMZ]]s, [[STUN]], [[UPnP]] and [[application-level gateway]]s might not be available at the ISP level.  ISP-level NAT may result in multiple-level address translation which is likely to further complicate the use of technologies such as [[port forwarding]] used to run Internet [[Server (computing)|servers]] within private networks.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}\n\n[[NAT64]] translates IPv6 requests from clients to IPv4 requests. This avoids the need to provision any IPv4 addresses to clients and allows clients that only support IPv6 to access IPv4 resources. However this approach requires a DNS server with [[DNS64]] capability and cannot support IPv4-only client devices.\n\n[[DS-Lite]] (Dual-Stack Light) uses tunnels from the customer premises equipment to a network address translator at the ISP.<ref>RFC 6333 - Dual-Stack Lite Broadband Deployments Following IPv4 Exhaustion</ref> The consumer premises equipment encapsulates the IPv4 packets in an IPv6 wrapper and sends them to a host known as the ''AFTR element''. The AFTR element de-encapsulates the packets and performs network address translation before sending them to the public Internet. The NAT in the AFTR uses the IPv6 address of the client in its NAT mapping table. This means that different clients can use the same private IPv4 addresses, therefore avoiding the need for allocating private IPv4 IP addresses to customers or using multiple NATs.\n\n[[Address plus Port]] allows stateless sharing of public IP addresses based on TCP/UDP port numbers. Each node is allocated both an IPv4 address and a range of [[Port (computer networking)|port numbers]] to use. Other nodes may be allocated the same IPv4 address but a different range of ports. The technique avoids the need for stateful address translation mechanisms in the core of the network, thus leaving end users in control of their own address translation.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}\n\n==Long-term solution==\n[[IPv6 deployment|Deployment of IPv6]] is the standards-based solution to the IPv4 address shortage.<ref name=\"APNIC\"/> IPv6 is endorsed and implemented by all Internet technical standards bodies and network equipment vendors. It encompasses many design improvements, including the replacement of the 32-bit IPv4 address format with a 128-bit address which provides an addressing space without limitations for the foreseeable future. IPv6 has been in active production deployment since June 2006, after organized worldwide testing and evaluation in the [[6bone]] project ceased. Interoperability for hosts using only IPv4 protocols is implemented with a variety of [[IPv6 transition mechanisms]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of assigned /8 IPv4 address blocks]]\n* [[512K Day]] \u2013 an event in 2014, involving the exhaustion of the default allocation of hardware routing slots on many routers\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [//www.iana.org/assignments/ipv4-address-space/ipv4-address-space.xhtml Official current state of IPv4 /8 allocations, as maintained by IANA]\n* [//www.icann.org/en/news/announcements/announcement-2-10feb08-en.htm ICANN recovers Large Block of Internet Addresses (14.0.0.0/8)] 2008-02-10\n* [//www.icann.org/en/resources/policy/global-addressing/proposal-ipv4-report-29nov07-en.htm Global Policy Proposal for Remaining IPv4 Address Space \u2013 Background Report] 2008-09-08\n* [http://www.potaroo.net/tools/ipv4/ potaroo.net: IPv4 Address Report with countdown]\n* RIR IPv4 status: [//www.apnic.net/community/ipv4-exhaustion/graphical-information APNIC] [//www.ripe.net/internet-coordination/ipv4-exhaustion/ipv4-available-pool-graph RIPE]\n\n{{IPv6}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Ipv4 Address Exhaustion}}\n[[Category:Hazards]]\n[[Category:Internet architecture]]\n[[Category:IPv4|Exhaustion]]\n[[Category:IP addresses|Exhaustion]]\n\n[[de:IPv6#Gr\u00fcnde f\u00fcr ein neues Internet-Protokoll]]\n", "name_user": "176.88.20.161", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eAddress depletion)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPv4_address_exhaustion"}
