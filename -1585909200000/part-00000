His father was the CEO of a prominent state-owned oil company and his mother hailed from a well-known [[Yugoslav Partisans|Partisan]] family, two of whose members were posthumously declared [[Righteous Among the Nations]] by [[Yad Vashem]] for saving [[Jews]] during [[The Holocaust]]. In the early 1990s, while he was still a teenager, Jeremi\u0107 and his parents were forced to leave Yugoslavia after falling out with the country's [[communism|communist]] government. Jeremi\u0107 graduated from [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] and [[Harvard University|Harvard]] in 1998 and 2003, respectively, and was active in several pro-democracy student movements during the 1990s. In the early 2000s, he joined what ''[[The New York Times]]'' deemed Serbia's \"most westward-leaning [[Government of Serbia|government]]\" as an advisor to [[President of Serbia|President]] [[Boris Tadi\u0107]]. In May 2007, while Tadi\u0107 was still in office, Jeremi\u0107 was appointed Minister of Foreign Affairs. During his tenure, he spearheaded Serbia's fervent opposition to [[Kosovo]]'s unilateral secession, Serbian authorities arrested a number of [[war crime]]s suspects and extradited them to the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]] in [[The Hague]], and there was a significant improvement in relations between Serbia and the West. In 2009, the [[European Union]] lifted all [[visa (document)|visa]] restrictions on citizens of Serbia, and in 2012, declared the country a [[Future enlargement of the European Union|candidate]] for membership.\n\nJeremi\u0107 remains the youngest person ever to have served as [[President of the United Nations General Assembly]], having been elected in 2012. His tenure saw [[State of Palestine|Palestine]] [[United Nations General Assembly resolution 67/19|granted]] non-member observer status in the General Assembly, the General Assembly's adoption of the [[Arms Trade Treaty]] (ATT), which aimed to regulate international [[conventional weapon]]s commerce, and the proclamation of 6 April as the International Day of Sport for Development and Peace.

In the early 1990s, while he was still a teenager, Jeremi\u0107 and his parents were forced to leave Yugoslavia after falling out with the country's [[communism|communist]] government. Jeremi\u0107 graduated from [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] and [[Harvard University|Harvard]] in 1998 and 2003, respectively, and was active in several pro-democracy student movements during the 1990s. In the early 2000s, he joined what ''[[The New York Times]]'' deemed Serbia's \"most westward-leaning [[Government of Serbia|government]]\" as an advisor to [[President of Serbia|President]] [[Boris Tadi\u0107]]. In May 2007, while Tadi\u0107 was still in office, Jeremi\u0107 was appointed Minister of Foreign Affairs. During his tenure, he spearheaded Serbia's fervent opposition to [[Kosovo]]'s unilateral secession, Serbian authorities arrested a number of [[war crime]]s suspects and extradited them to the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]] in [[The Hague]], and there was a significant improvement in relations between Serbia and the West. In 2009, the [[European Union]] lifted all [[visa (document)|visa]] restrictions on citizens of Serbia, and in 2012, declared the country a [[Future enlargement of the European Union|candidate]] for membership.\n\nJeremi\u0107 remains the youngest person ever to have served as [[President of the United Nations General Assembly]], having been elected in 2012. His tenure saw [[State of Palestine|Palestine]] [[United Nations General Assembly resolution 67/19|granted]] non-member observer status in the General Assembly, the General Assembly's adoption of the [[Arms Trade Treaty]] (ATT), which aimed to regulate international [[conventional weapon]]s commerce, and the proclamation of 6 April as the International Day of Sport for Development and Peace.

The daughter of a Christian bookbinder purchased from Brandeis povidl (plum jam) which she claimed had made her family ill; as her father coincidentally died a few days after eating it. The [[burgomaster]] of the city ordered the closure of Brandeis' store and imprisoned him, his wife, and son for selling poisonous food to Christians. Investigations by municipal authorities and the court of appeal in Prague revealed that the bookbinder had died of [[Tuberculosis|consumption]] and the charges were dismissed. Brandeis wrote a scroll which he called ''Shir HaMa'alot l'David'' (\"A [[Song of Ascents]] to David\"), to be read on 10 Adar, accompanied by a festive meal. He was freed from prison four days before Purim after the charges against him were proven to be false, and in celebration of his release, Jews from his city celebrated with povidl or plum hamantaschen.\n<ref>{{cite web |last1=Sacharin |first1=Emily |title=A Purim Classic: Sugar Cookie Hamantaschen |url=https://www.poppyandprune.com/2018/02/12/purim-classic-sugar-cookie-hamantaschen/ |website=Poppy and Prune |accessdate=15 March 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Purims, Special |url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/12450-purims-special#anchor26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304204004/http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/12450-purims-special#anchor26 |url-status=dead |archive-date=4 March 2016 |website=Jewish Encyclopedia |accessdate=15 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Vanilla pastry cream with chocolate chips===\n\n[[File:Hamantashen.jpg|thumb|right|Hamantash filled with vanilla pastry cream and chocolate chips prior to baking.]]\n\nIsraeli baker Uri Scheft offers hamantaschen filled with a vanilla [[custard|pastry cream]] and chocolate chips at Lehamim/Breads Bakery, his bakeries in [[Tel Aviv]] and [[New York City]].

The dough is generally prepared with flour, eggs, sugar, butter (or margarine or cooking oil), and a flavoring such as vanilla (or sometimes [[cocoa]], [[rose water]], or [[orange blossom water]] may be used); sometimes milk is used in the dough, and sometimes a leavener such as baking powder or baking soda is added as well.

The bottom and the top two corners of the dough are folded inward but do not fully enclose the filling, allowing it to remain visible. Sometimes hamantaschen may be frozen for a short period of time after shaping in order to prevent leakage of the filling. Then they are baked in an oven at medium heat for a short duration of time.

The daughter of a Christian bookbinder purchased from Brandeis povidl (plum jam) which she claimed had made her family ill; as her father coincidentally died a few days after eating it. The [[burgomaster]] of the city ordered the closure of Brandeis' store and imprisoned him, his wife, and son for selling poisonous food to Christians. Investigations by municipal authorities and the court of appeal in Prague revealed that the bookbinder had died of [[Tuberculosis|consumption]] and the charges were dismissed. Brandeis wrote a scroll which he called ''Shir HaMa'alot l'David'' (\"A [[Song of Ascents]] to David\"), to be read on 10 Adar, accompanied by a festive meal. He was freed from prison four days before Purim after the charges against him were proven to be false, and in celebration of his release, Jews from his city celebrated with povidl or plum hamantaschen.\n<ref>{{cite web |last1=Sacharin |first1=Emily |title=A Purim Classic: Sugar Cookie Hamantaschen |url=https://www.poppyandprune.com/2018/02/12/purim-classic-sugar-cookie-hamantaschen/ |website=Poppy and Prune |accessdate=15 March 2020}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Purims, Special |url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/12450-purims-special#anchor26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304204004/http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/12450-purims-special#anchor26 |url-status=dead |archive-date=4 March 2016 |website=Jewish Encyclopedia |accessdate=15 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Vanilla pastry cream with chocolate chips===\n\n[[File:Hamantashen.jpg|thumb|right|Hamantash filled with vanilla pastry cream and chocolate chips prior to baking.]]\n\nIsraeli baker Uri Scheft offers hamantaschen filled with a vanilla [[custard|pastry cream]] and chocolate chips at Lehamim/Breads Bakery, his bakeries in [[Tel Aviv]] and [[New York City]].

The dough is generally prepared with flour, eggs, sugar, butter (or margarine or cooking oil), and a flavoring such as vanilla (or sometimes [[cocoa]], [[rose water]], or [[orange blossom water]] may be used); sometimes milk is used in the dough, and sometimes a leavener such as baking powder or baking soda is added as well.

The bottom and the top two corners of the dough are folded inward but do not fully enclose the filling, allowing it to remain visible. Sometimes hamantaschen may be frozen for a short period of time after shaping in order to prevent leakage of the filling. Then they are baked in an oven at medium heat for a short duration of time.
