ACT 30 of 1992, by means of which the public education is ruled, in its article 137 stated that the Universidad Militar \u201cNueva Granada\u201d which provides higher education programs, shall continue ascribed to the corresponding entity - Ministry of National Defense - and shall work in accordance to its legal status - Special Administrative Unit - adjusting its academic regime to the terms of the aforementioned law.\n\nIn January 1984, the university moved to its present location in Bogot\u00e1, Colombia (carrera 11 No. 101-80), a strategic area of the city, where a financial center of prime importance emerges, as well as other entities of the defense sector.\n\nAs of March 2003, through ACT 805 of said year, the university modifies its legal status constituting itself as an autonomous university entity of a national order with a special organic regime, whose main goal deals with higher education geared to academically support the Military Forces, the National Police and the Defense Sector, and all its active or retired members, their families and the civilians in general.\n\n== Faculties and departments ==\n\n*'''Faculty of Engineering'''\n**[[Mechatronics Engineering]]\n**[[Civil Engineering]]\n**Multimedia Engineering\n**[[Telecommunication Engineering]]\n**[[Industrial Engineering]]\n**Electronics and Communications Technology\n*'''Faculty of Economic Sciences'''\n**[[Business Administration]]\n**[[Public accounting]]\n**Technology in Accounting and Tax\n**[[Economy]]\n*'''School of International Relations and Security Strategy'''\n**International Relations and Political Studies\n**Administration of Occupational Safety and Health\n*'''Faculty of Law'''\n**[[Law]]\n*'''Faculty of Medicine'''\n**Medicine and Health Sciences,\n**Premedical\n*'''Faculty of Science'''\n**Applied biology\n**Horticulture Technology,\n**Master of Applied Biology.\n*'''Faculty of education and Humanities'''\n**Bioetica clinical and social\n**Education\n**University teaching\n**Scientific research Metologia\n*'''Faculty of distance studies'''\n**Business Administration\n**Public accounting\n**International relations\n**Civil Engineering\n**Industrial Engineering\n\n== Campus ==\n\nIn 2005 New Granada Military University purchased a lot adjacent to the Hacienda Riogrande, areas for the construction of a campus for new generations of Colombians. With the75.5 acre campus is expected to become the third-largest in Latin America.\n\nApart from administrative buildings and schools which have own Auditorium, internet room, classrooms and cafeterias, contemplates the execution of special buildings which are inserted to the educational work of the University according to the requirements of each program and to the preferences of each student. These buildings include: Church, Sports Center, library, main auditorium, headquarters, Aquatics Center, gym, IMA (Institute military aeronautical), concha acoustic circuit athletic Stadium, pitch softball, treatment plant sewage treatment of groundwater, solid waste treatment plant, plant treatment of waters of the Bogot\u00e1 River, power plant, etc.)\n\n== Publications and media ==\n\nWith the goal of expanding and diversifying access to knowledge, the UMNG has their own publications, such as the Neogranadine newspaper,<ref name=Neogranadino>[http://www.umng.edu.co/www/section-2469.jsp#5559 Comunicaciones y prensa], P\u00e1gina Oficial.</ref> In addition to his own books and indexed journals that makes available to the public.<ref name=Publicaciones>[http://www.umng.edu.co/www/section-6242.jsp Cat\u00e1logo de Publicaciones UMNG], P\u00e1gina Oficial.</ref> The military University also has its own station transmitting via the Internet for public access, it can be heard on the http://radio.umng.edu.co/ website every day.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Colombia}}\n* [[List of universities in Colombia]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n<!--==References==-->\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.umng.edu.co/es/web/guest Universidad Militar Nueva Granada] official site {{in lang|es}}\n*[http://www.umng.edu.co/en/web/guest The University] official site (English)\n\n{{Universities in Colombia}}\n\n{{coord|4.68307|N|74.0419|W|source:kolossus-eswiki|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:Universities and colleges in Colombia]]\n", "name_user": "Ser Amantio di Nicolao", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eExternal links:add authority control", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nueva_Granada_Military_University"}

In the initial days of his reign, the control of the kingdom was in the hands of Mukammal Khan, an Ahmadnagar official and his son. Burhan converted to Shi'i Islam under the tutelage of Shah Tahir Husaini.{{cite book |last=Sohoni |first=Pushkar |editor-last=Roxburgh |editor-first=David J. |title=Seeing the Past - Envisioning Islamic Art and Architecture: Essays in Honor of Renata Holod  |publisher=Brill, Leiden |date=2014 |pages=110\u2013127 |chapter=Patterns of Faith: Mosque Typologies and sectarian affiliation in the kingdom of Ahmadnagar |isbn=9789004264021}} Burhan died in Ahmadnagar in 1553. He left six sons, of whom [[Hussain Nizam Shah I]] succeeded him. Hussain was a leading figurehead of the [[Deccan Sultanates]] during the [[Battle of Talikota]].\n\nAfter the death of Hussain in 1565, his minor son [[Murtaza Nizam Shah I]] ascended the throne. During his minority, his mother Khanzada Humayun Sultana ruled as a regent for several years. Murtaza Shah annexed [[Amravati Division|Berar]] in 1572. On his death in 1588, his son Miran Hussain ascended the throne. But his reign could last only a little more than ten months as he was poisoned to death. Ismail, a cousin of Miran Hussain was raised to the throne, but the actual power was in the hands of Jamal Khan, the leader of the Deccani/Habshi group in the court. Jamal Khan was killed in the battle of Rohankhed in 1591 and soon Ismail Shah was also captured and confined by his father Burhan, who ascended the throne as [[Burhan Nizam Shah II]]. But his sister [[Chand Bibi]] fought him. Winning the kingdom, Chand Bibi ascended the throne as regent for the new infant sultan, [[Bahadur Nizam Shah]]. She repulsed an invasion by the [[Mughal Empire]] with the reinforcements from the [[Bijapur Sultanate|Bijapur]] and [[Golconda Sultanate]]s. After the death of Chand Bibi in July 1600, Ahmadnagar was conquered by the Mughals and the Sultan was imprisoned.\n\n===Malik Ambar and the demise of the sultanate===\n[[File:Murtaza Nizam Shah II and Malik Ambar.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Murtaza Nizam Shah II with an Malik Ambar]]\nAlthough, Ahmadnagar city and its adjoining areas were occupied by the Mughals, an extensive part of the kingdom still remained in possession of the influential officials of the Nizam Shahi dynasty. [[Malik Ambar]] and other Ahmadnagar officials defied the Mughals and declared [[Murtaza Nizam Shah II]] as sultan in 1600 at a new capital [[Paranda]]. Malik Ambar became prime minister and ''Vakil-us-Saltanat'' of Ahmadnagar.<ref name=m>Majumdar, R.C. (ed.) (2007). ''The Mughul Empire'', Mumbai: Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, {{Listed Invalid ISBN|81-7276-407-1}}, pp.415\u201345</ref> Later, the capital was shifted first to Junnar and then to a new city Khadki (later [[Aurangabad, Maharashtra|Aurangabad]]).\n\nAfter the death of Malik Ambar in May 1626, his son Fath Khan surrendered to the Mughals in 1633 and handed over the young Nizam Shahi ruler Hussain Shah, who was sent as a prisoner to the fort of Gwalior. But soon, [[Shahaji]] with the assistance of  Bijapur, placed an infant scion of the Nizam Shahi dynasty, [[Murtaza Nizam Shah III]] on the throne and he became the regent. In 1636 [[Aurangzeb]], then Mughal viceroy of Deccan finally annexed the sultanate to the Mughal empire after defeating Shahaji.\n\n===Revenue System of Malik Ambar===\nThe revenue system introduced by Malik Ambar was based on the revenue system introduced in Northern India and some parts of Gujarat and Khandesh [[Subah (province)|subahs]] by Raja [[Todar Mal|Todarmal]]. Lands were classified as good or bad according to their fertility and he took a number of years to ascertain accurately the average yield of lands. He abolished the revenue farming. At first, revenue was fixed as two-fifths of the actual produce in kind, but later the cultivators were allowed to pay in cash equivalent to approximately one-third of the yield.

He left six sons, of whom [[Hussain Nizam Shah I]] succeeded him. Hussain was a leading figurehead of the [[Deccan Sultanates]] during the [[Battle of Talikota]].\n\nAfter the death of Hussain in 1565, his minor son [[Murtaza Nizam Shah I]] ascended the throne. During his minority, his mother Khanzada Humayun Sultana ruled as a regent for several years. Murtaza Shah annexed [[Amravati Division|Berar]] in 1572. On his death in 1588, his son Miran Hussain ascended the throne. But his reign could last only a little more than ten months as he was poisoned to death. Ismail, a cousin of Miran Hussain was raised to the throne, but the actual power was in the hands of Jamal Khan, the leader of the Deccani/Habshi group in the court. Jamal Khan was killed in the battle of Rohankhed in 1591 and soon Ismail Shah was also captured and confined by his father Burhan, who ascended the throne as [[Burhan Nizam Shah II]]. But his sister [[Chand Bibi]] fought him. Winning the kingdom, Chand Bibi ascended the throne as regent for the new infant sultan, [[Bahadur Nizam Shah]]. She repulsed an invasion by the [[Mughal Empire]] with the reinforcements from the [[Bijapur Sultanate|Bijapur]] and [[Golconda Sultanate]]s. After the death of Chand Bibi in July 1600, Ahmadnagar was conquered by the Mughals and the Sultan was imprisoned.\n\n===Malik Ambar and the demise of the sultanate===\n[[File:Murtaza Nizam Shah II and Malik Ambar.jpg|thumb|left|150px|Murtaza Nizam Shah II with an Malik Ambar]]\nAlthough, Ahmadnagar city and its adjoining areas were occupied by the Mughals, an extensive part of the kingdom still remained in possession of the influential officials of the Nizam Shahi dynasty. [[Malik Ambar]] and other Ahmadnagar officials defied the Mughals and declared [[Murtaza Nizam Shah II]] as sultan in 1600 at a new capital [[Paranda]]. Malik Ambar became prime minister and ''Vakil-us-Saltanat'' of Ahmadnagar.<ref name=m>Majumdar, R.C. (ed.) (2007). ''The Mughul Empire'', Mumbai: Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan, {{Listed Invalid ISBN|81-7276-407-1}}, pp.415\u201345</ref> Later, the capital was shifted first to Junnar and then to a new city Khadki (later [[Aurangabad, Maharashtra|Aurangabad]]).\n\nAfter the death of Malik Ambar in May 1626, his son Fath Khan surrendered to the Mughals in 1633 and handed over the young Nizam Shahi ruler Hussain Shah, who was sent as a prisoner to the fort of Gwalior. But soon, [[Shahaji]] with the assistance of  Bijapur, placed an infant scion of the Nizam Shahi dynasty, [[Murtaza Nizam Shah III]] on the throne and he became the regent. In 1636 [[Aurangzeb]], then Mughal viceroy of Deccan finally annexed the sultanate to the Mughal empire after defeating Shahaji.\n\n===Revenue System of Malik Ambar===\nThe revenue system introduced by Malik Ambar was based on the revenue system introduced in Northern India and some parts of Gujarat and Khandesh [[Subah (province)|subahs]] by Raja [[Todar Mal|Todarmal]]. Lands were classified as good or bad according to their fertility and he took a number of years to ascertain accurately the average yield of lands. He abolished the revenue farming. At first, revenue was fixed as two-fifths of the actual produce in kind, but later the cultivators were allowed to pay in cash equivalent to approximately one-third of the yield.
