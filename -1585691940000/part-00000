(During Milo\u0161evi\u0107's tenure as President of Serbia, the government of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was de facto subordinate to his government, with Milo\u0161evi\u0107 installing and forcing the removal of several Federal Presidents and Prime Ministers. However this changed after 1997 when Milo\u0161evi\u0107's last legal term as Serbian President ended and he became Federal President that year, in which Milo\u0161evi\u0107 entrenched the power of the Federal Presidency.)</ref> Milo\u0161evi\u0107 installed and forced the removal of several federal presidents (such as [[Dobrica \u0106osi\u0107]]) and prime ministers (such as [[Milan Pani\u0107]]).<ref name=\"Sabrina P. Ramet 2005. Pp. 61\"/> However, the Montenegrin government, initially enthusiastic supporters of Milo\u0161evi\u0107, started gradually distancing themselves from his policies. That culminated in regime change in 1996, when his former ally [[Milo \u0110ukanovi\u0107]] reversed his policies, became leader of Montenegro's ruling party and subsequently dismissed former Montenegrin leader [[Momir Bulatovi\u0107]], who remained loyal to the Milo\u0161evi\u0107 government. As Bulatovi\u0107 was given central positions in [[Belgrade]] from that time (as federal Prime Minister), \u0110ukanovi\u0107 continued to govern Montenegro and further isolated it from Serbia. Thus from 1996 to 2006 Montenegro and Serbia were only nominally part of the same country as governance at every feasible level was conducted locally, in Belgrade for Serbia and in [[Podgorica]] for Montenegro.\n\nAs a loose union or confederacy, Montenegro and Serbia were united only in certain realms, such as defense and sports. The two constituent republics functioned separately throughout the period of the Federal Republic, and continued to operate under separate economic policies, as well as using separate currencies (the [[euro]] was the only legal tender in Montenegro). On 21 May 2006, the [[2006 Montenegrin independence referendum|Montenegrin independence referendum]] was held, in which 55.5% of voters voted in favor of independence. The last vestiges of the former Yugoslavia, 88 years after its creation, came to an end upon Montenegro's formal declaration of independence on 3 June 2006, and [[Serbia]]'s formal declaration of independence on 5 June. After the dissolution, Serbia became the [[Succession of states|legal successor]] of the union, while the newly [[Montenegro|independent Montenegro]] re-applied for membership in international organisations.\n\n==Etymology==\nOfficially, the country was known as the \"Federal Republic of Yugoslavia\" (\u0421\u0430\u0432\u0435\u0437\u043d\u0430 \u0420\u0435\u043f\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u0408\u0443\u0433\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0458\u0430 / ''Savezna Republika Jugoslavija'') from 1992 to 2003, or \"Yugoslavia\" for short. The name ''Yugoslavia'', an Anglicised transcription of ''Jugoslavija'', is a composite word made up of ''jug'' ('yug') (with the 'j' pronounced like an English 'y') and ''slavija''. The [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] word ''jug'' means 'south', while ''slavija'' ('Slavia\") denotes a 'land of the [[Slavs]]'. Thus, a translation of \"''Jugoslavija''\" would be 'South-Slavia' or '[[South Slavs|South Slav]] Land'.\n\nEven when Serbia and Montenegro was known officially as the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (or Yugoslavia for short), some countries, such as the United States, had referred to it as ''Serbia and Montenegro''<ref name=\"Serbia and Montenegro\">1999 [[CIA]] [[World Factbook]]: [http://www.umsl.edu/services/govdocs/wofact99/265.htm Serbia and Montenegro]</ref> as their governments viewed its claim to Yugoslavia's successorship as illegitimate.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000816214535/http://www.cia.gov:80/cia/publications/factbook/sr.html|work=The World Factbook 1999|title=Serbia and Montenegro|date=16 August 2000|publisher=Central Intelligence Agency|location=Virginia}}</ref>\n\nThe 2003 constitution states that the name of the state was \"Serbia and Montenegro\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226024403/http://www.mfa.gov.rs/Facts/const_scg.pdf|title=Constitutional Charter of the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro|quote=The name of the state union shall be Serbia and Montenegro.|date=2003|access-date=26 February 2009}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{Main|Breakup of Yugoslavia}}\n\nWith the collapse of [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] during the 1990s, only the republics of [[Republic of Serbia (federal)|Serbia]] and [[Republic of Montenegro (federal)|Montenegro]] agreed to maintain the Yugoslav state, and established a new constitution for a new Yugoslavia in 1992. With the collapse of communism across Eastern Europe, the new state followed the wave of free market change. It abandoned communist symbolism: the [[red star]] was removed from the national flag, and the communist coat of arms was replaced by a white double-headed eagle with the arms of both Serbia and Montenegro within it. The new state also established the office of the [[President of Serbia and Montenegro|president]], held by a single person, initially appointed with the consent of the republics of Serbia and Montenegro until 1997 after which the president was democratically elected.\n\n===Foundation===\nWith the collapse of Yugoslavia and its institutions from 1991 to 1992, the issue of unity of the two republics remaining in the collapsing federation, Serbia, Montenegro, as well as Serb-majority territories in Croatia and Bosnia that wished to remain united, became an issue. In 1991 diplomatic talks chaired by Lord Carrington with the leaders of the six republics of the collapsing federation, resulted in all the republics except for Serbia agreeing that Yugoslavia had collapsed and that each republic should become an independent state. The Serbian government was surprised and outraged by Montenegro's decision in favor of terminating Yugoslavia, as the Bulatovic government had previously been closely allied with Milosevic's government in Serbia.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} Yugoslavia's collapse began in 1991 when [[Slovenia]], [[Croatia]], and [[North Macedonia|Macedonia]] declared independence.\n\nOn 26 December 1991, Serbia, Montenegro, and the Serb rebel-held territories in Croatia agreed that they would form a new \"third Yugoslavia\".<ref>Sabrina P.

This was due to the ongoing [[Yugoslav wars]] during the 1990s, which had prevented agreement being reached on the disposition of federal assets and liabilities, particularly the national debt. The Government of Yugoslavia supported Croatian and Bosnian Serbs in the [[Yugoslav wars|wars]] from 1992 to 1995. Because of that, the country was under economic and political sanctions, which resulted in economic disaster that forced thousands of its young citizens to emigrate from the country.\n\nIn a [[BBC]] documentary, called ''[[The Death of Yugoslavia]]'', and later in his testimony before the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]] during the [[trial of Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107]], Yugoslav official [[Borisav Jovi\u0107]] revealed that the Bosnian Serb army arose from the Yugoslav army forces in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. He claimed that he had realized that Bosnia and Herzegovina was about to be recognized by the international community, and since [[Yugoslav People's Army]] troops were still located there at that point, their presence on Bosnian territory could have led to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia being accused of aggression. To avoid this, he and Milo\u0161evi\u0107 decided to move all JNA soldiers originating from Serbia and Montenegro back into Serbia and Montenegro, and to move all JNA soldiers of Bosnian Serb descent to Bosnia and Herzegovina.<ref name=\"youtube1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5kD1FdxvIE|title=Bosnia: Who Lit the Fire?|publisher=YouTube|date=11 November 2007|accessdate=2010-08-26}}</ref> In this way, every Bosnian Serb was transferred from the Yugoslav army to what became the newly created Bosnian Serb army.

By 1998, simultaneously with Montenegrin Prime Minister [[Milo \u0110ukanovi\u0107]] coming out on top in the power struggle with Montenegrin President [[Momir Bulatovi\u0107]], the republic undertook a different [[economic policy]] by adopting the [[Deutsche Mark]] as its currency. During autumn 1999, following the Kosovo War and the NATO bombing campaign, \u0110ukanovi\u0107 (who by now firmly held power in Montenegro as Bulatovi\u0107 was completely squeezed out) drafted a document called ''Platforma za redefiniciju odnosa Crne Gore i Srbije'' (A platform for redefinition of relations within Montenegro and Serbia) calling for major changes in the division of governing responsibilities within FR Yugoslavia though still officially seeing Montenegro within a joint state with Serbia. Milo\u0161evi\u0107 did not respond to the platform, considering it unconstitutional. Political relations within the federal state became more and more strained, especially against the backdrop of the wave of assassinations against top figures from political, criminal, and state business circles in both republics ([[\u017deljko Ra\u017enatovi\u0107|\u017deljko \"Arkan\" Ra\u017enatovi\u0107]], [[Pavle Bulatovi\u0107]], [[\u017dika Petrovi\u0107]], and [[Goran \u017dugi\u0107]] as well as two attempts on the life of opposition politician [[Vuk Dra\u0161kovi\u0107]]). By October 2000 Milo\u0161evi\u0107 had lost power in Serbia. Contrary to expectation, \u0110ukanovi\u0107's response to the power change in Belgrade was not to further push the agenda outlined in his platform, but instead to suddenly start pushing for full independence, thus completely dropping the platform in the process. Subsequent governments of Montenegro carried out pro-independence policies, and political tensions with Serbia simmered despite political changes in Belgrade.\n\n====Kosovo War====\n{{Main|Kosovo War}}\n[[File:Zasto.jpg|thumb|The ''Za\u0161to?({{Lang-sr-Cyrl|\u0417\u0430\u0448\u0442\u043e}}'', \"Why?\") Monument, dedicated to the employees of the Radio Television of Serbia ([[Radio Television of Serbia|RTS]]) who were killed during NATO bombing of the RTS building in 1999]]\n\nWith Milo\u0161evi\u0107's second and last legal term as Serbian President expiring in 1997, he ran for, and was elected President of Yugoslavia in 1997. Upon taking office, Milo\u0161evi\u0107 gained direct control of the Yugoslav military and security forces, and directed them to engage Kosovar separatists. The conflict escalated from 1998 to 1999 and became known as the [[Kosovo War]].\n\n[[Military of Serbia and Montenegro|Yugoslav forces]] committed a series of atrocities in Kosovo. To prevent ethnic cleansing, the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO) under the leadership of the United States began an air campaign called [[Operation Allied Force]] against Yugoslav military forces and positions and suspected Serbian paramilitaries.<ref>{{cite book|last=Judah|title=The Serbs|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-15826-7}}</ref> The air attacks against Belgrade by NATO were the first attacks on the city since [[World War II]]. Some of the worst massacres against civilian Albanians by Serbian forces occurred after NATO started its bombing of Yugoslavia.

On 4 February 2003, the [[Parliament of Serbia and Montenegro|federal assembly of Yugoslavia]] created a loose [[state union]] or confederacy\u2014the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro, although Yugoslavia was still commonly used. A new [[Constitutional Charter of Serbia and Montenegro|constitutional charter]] was agreed to provide a framework for the governance of the country.\n\nOn Sunday, 21 May 2006, [[Montenegrins (ethnic group)|Montenegrins]] voted in an [[2006 Montenegrin independence referendum|independence referendum]], with 55.5% supporting independence. Fifty-five percent or more of affirmative votes were needed to dissolve the confederation and Yugoslavia. The turnout was 86.3% and 99.73% of the more than 477,000 votes cast were deemed valid.\n\nThe subsequent Montenegrin proclamation of independence on June 2006 and the Serbian proclamation of independence on 5 June ended the confederation of Yugoslavia and thus the last remaining vestiges of the former [[Yugoslavia]].\n\n==Politics==\n{{Main|Politics of Serbia and Montenegro}}\nThe Federal Assembly of the FRY (1992\u20132003) was composed of two chambers: the Council of Citizens and the Council of Republics. Whereas the Council of Citizens served as an ordinary assembly, representing the people of FRY, the Council of Republics was made equally by representatives from the federation's constituent republics, to ensure federal equality.\n\nThe status of leadership of the FRY president was unstable with no president lasting more than four years in office. The first president from 1992 to 1993 was [[Dobrica \u0106osi\u0107]], a former communist [[Yugoslav partisan]] during World War II and later one of the fringe contributors of the controversial [[Memorandum of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts]]. Despite being head of the country, \u0106osi\u0107 was forced out of office in 1993 due to his opposition to Serbian President [[Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107]]. \u0106osi\u0107 was replaced by [[Zoran Lili\u0107]] who served from 1993 to 1997, and then followed by Milo\u0161evi\u0107 becoming Yugoslav President in 1997 after his last legal term as Serbian president ended in 1997. The presidential election in 2000 was accused of being the result of vote fraud. Yugoslav citizens took to the streets and engaged in [[Overthrow of Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107|riots in Belgrade]] demanding that Milo\u0161evi\u0107 be removed from power. Shortly afterwards Milo\u0161evi\u0107 resigned and [[Vojislav Ko\u0161tunica]] took over as Yugoslav president and remained president until the state's reconstitution as the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro.\n\nFederal Prime Minister [[Milan Pani\u0107]] became frustrated with Milo\u0161evi\u0107's domineering behaviour during diplomatic talks in 1992, and told Milo\u0161evi\u0107 to \"shut up\" because Milo\u0161evi\u0107's position was officially subordinate to his position.<ref>James Gow.

Pp. 61\"/>\n\nAfter the federation was reconstituted as a state union, the new [[Parliament of Serbia and Montenegro|Assembly of the State Union]] was created. It was unicameral and was made up of 126 deputies, of which 91 were from Serbia and 35 were from Montenegro. The Assembly convened in the building of the old Federal Assembly of FRY, which now houses the [[National Assembly of Serbia]].\n\nIn 2003, after the constitutional changes and creation of the [[State Union of Serbia and Montenegro]], a new [[President of Serbia and Montenegro]] was elected. He was also president of the [[Council of Ministers of Serbia and Montenegro]].\n[[Svetozar Marovi\u0107]] was the first and last President of Serbia and Montenegro until its breakup in 2006.\n\n== Armed Forces of Serbia and Montenegro ==\nThe [[Armed Forces of Serbia and Montenegro]] ([[Serbian language|Serbian]]: \u0412\u043e\u0458\u0441\u043a\u0430 \u0421\u0440\u0431\u0438\u0458\u0435 \u0438 \u0426\u0440\u043d\u0435 \u0413\u043e\u0440\u0435/Vojska Srbije i Crne Gore; \u0412\u0421\u0426\u0413/VSCG) included ground forces with internal and border troops, [[Navy|naval forces]], [[Air force|air and air defense forces]], and [[civil defense]].

It had two autonomous provinces: [[Kosovo and Metohija]] in the south (with 30 municipalities), which was under the administration of [[UNMIK]] after 1999, and [[Vojvodina]] in the north (with 46 municipalities and 1 city). The territory between Kosovo and Vojvodina was called [[Central Serbia]]. Central Serbia was not an administrative division on its own and had no regional government of its own.\n\nIn addition, there were four cities: Belgrade, [[Ni\u0161]], [[Novi Sad]] and [[Kragujevac]], each having an assembly and budget of its own. The cities comprised several municipalities, divided into \"urban\" (in the city proper) and \"other\" (suburban). Competences of cities and their municipalities were divided.\n\nMunicipalities were gathered into [[Districts of Serbia|districts]], which are regional centres of state authority, but have no assemblies of their own; they present purely administrative divisions, and host various state institutions such as funds, office branches and courts. The Republic of Serbia was then and is still today divided into 29 districts (17 in Central Serbia, 7 in Vojvodina and 5 in Kosovo, which are now defunct), while the city of Belgrade presents a district of its own.\n\n===Montenegro===\nMontenegro was divided into [[Municipalities of Montenegro|21 municipalities]].\n\n==Geography==\n{{see also|Geography of Serbia|Geography of Montenegro}}\nSerbia and Montenegro had an area of 102,350 square kilometres (39,518&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi), with 199 kilometres (124&nbsp;mi) of coastline. The terrain of the two republics is extremely varied, with much of Serbia comprising plains and low hills (except in the more mountainous region of Kosovo and Metohija) and much of Montenegro consisting of high mountains. Serbia is entirely landlocked, with the coastline belonging to Montenegro. The climate is similarly varied. The north has a [[continental climate]] (cold winters and hot summers); the central region has a combination of a continental and [[Mediterranean climate]]; the southern region had an [[Adriatic sea|Adriatic climate]] along the coast, with inland regions experiencing hot, dry summers and autumns and relatively cold winters with heavy snowfall inland.\n\n[[Belgrade]], with its population of 1,574,050, is the largest city in the two nations: and the only one of significant size. The country's other principal cities were [[Novi Sad]], [[Ni\u0161]], [[Kragujevac]], [[Podgorica]], [[Subotica]], [[Pristina]], and [[Prizren]], each with populations of about 100,000\u2013250,000 people.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Main|Demographics of Serbia and Montenegro}}\n\nSerbia and Montenegro had more demographic variety than most other European countries. The three largest named nationalities were [[Serbs]] (62.3%), [[Albanians]] (16.6%) and [[Montenegrins (ethnic group)|Montenegrins]] (5%) according to the 1991 census. The country also had significant populations of [[Hungarians]], [[Yugoslavs]], [[Muslims by nationality|Muslims (ethnic group)]], [[Romani people|Roma]], [[Croats]], [[Bulgarians]], [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|Macedonians]], [[Romanians]], [[Vlachs of Serbia|Vlachs]] and others (under 1%). Most of the ethnic diversity was situated in the provinces of [[Kosovo]] and [[Vojvodina]], where smaller numbers of other minority groups could be found. The large [[Albania]]n population was chiefly concentrated in [[Kosovo]], with smaller populations in the [[Pre\u0161evo Valley]], and in the [[Ulcinj]] municipality. The ''Muslims'' (Slavic Muslims, including [[Bosniaks]]) population lived mostly in the [[Sand\u017eak|federal border region]] (mainly [[Novi Pazar]] in Serbia, and [[Ro\u017eaje]] in Montenegro).\n\n;Total Serbia-Montenegro \u2013 10,019,657\n* [[Republic of Serbia (federal)|Serbia]] (total): 9,396,411\n** Vojvodina: 2,116,725\n** Central Serbia: 5,479,686\n** Kosovo: 1,800,000\n* [[Republic of Montenegro (federal)|Montenegro]]: 623,246\n* Major cities (over 100,000 inhabitants) \u2013 2002 data (2003 for Podgorica):\n** [[Beograd]] (Belgrade): 1,280,639 (1,574,050 metro)\n** [[Novi Sad]]: 215,600 (298,139 metro)\n** [[Pristina]]: 200,000 (2002 estimate)\n** [[Ni\u0161]]: 173,390 (234,863 metro)\n** [[Kragujevac]]: 145,890 (175,182 metro)\n** [[Podgorica]]: 139,500 (169,000 metro)\n** [[Prizren]]: 121,000 (2002 estimate)\n** [[Subotica]]: 99,471 (147,758 metro)\n\nAccording to a 2004 estimate the State Union had 10,825,900 inhabitants.\n\nAccording to a July 2006 estimate, the State Union had 10,832,545 inhabitants.\n\n==Economy==\n{{Main|Economy of Serbia and Montenegro}}\nThe state suffered significantly economically due to the breakup of Yugoslavia and mismanagement of the economy, and an extended period of economic sanctions. In the early 1990s, the FRY suffered from [[hyperinflation]] of the Yugoslav dinar. By the mid-1990s, the FRY had overcome the inflation. Further damage to Yugoslavia's infrastructure and industry caused by the [[Kosovo War]] left the economy only half the size it was in 1990. Since the ousting of former Federal Yugoslav President [[Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107]] in October 2000, the [[Democratic Opposition of Serbia]] (DOS) coalition government has implemented stabilization measures and embarked on an aggressive market reform program. After renewing its membership in the [[International Monetary Fund]] in December 2000, Yugoslavia continued to reintegrate with other world nations by rejoining the [[World Bank]] and the [[European Bank for Reconstruction and Development]].\n<!--\nPLEASE REWRITE AND UPDATE THIS PART SO THAT IT IS APPLICABLE TO THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF YUGOSLAVIA.\nA World Bank-[[European Commission]] sponsored Donors' Conference held in June 2001 raised $1.3 billion for economic restructuring. An agreement rescheduling the country's $4.5 billion [[Paris Club]] government debts was concluded in November 2001; it will write off 66% of the debt; a similar debt relief agreement on its $2.8 billion [[London Club]] commercial debt has been reached in July 2004; 62% of the debt have been written off. -->\n\nThe smaller republic of [[Montenegro]] severed its economy from federal control and from Serbia during the Milo\u0161evi\u0107 era. Afterwards, the two republics had separate central banks whilst Montenegro began to use different currencies \u2013 it first adopted the [[Deutsch mark]], and continued to use it until the mark fell into disuse to be replaced by the [[euro]]. Serbia continued to use the Yugoslav Dinar, renaming it the ''[[Serbian dinar]]''.<!-- rewrite as part of history\nThe southern Serbian province of [[Kosovo]], while formally still part of Serbia (according to United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244), is moving toward local autonomy under the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo ([[UNMIK]]) and is dependent on the international community for financial and technical assistance. The euro is official currency, and UNMIK collects taxes and manages the budget. -->\n\nThe complexity of the FRY's political relationships, slow progress in privatisation, and stagnation in the European economy were detrimental to the economy. Arrangements with the IMF, especially requirements for fiscal discipline, were an important element in policy formation. Severe unemployment was a key political and economic problem. Corruption also presented a major problem, with a large [[black market]] and a high degree of criminal involvement in the formal economy.\n\n==Transport==\n[[File:Passport of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.jpg|thumb|upright|A Federal Republic of Yugoslavia passport]]\n\nSerbia, and in particular the valley of the [[Morava River, Serbia|Morava]] is often described as \"the crossroads between the [[Eastern world|East]] and the [[Western world|West]]\" \u2013 one of the primary reasons for its turbulent history.

[[European route E763|E763]]/[[European route E761|E761]] was the most important route connecting Serbia with Montenegro.\n\nThe [[Danube]], an important international waterway, flowed through Serbia.\n\nThe [[Port of Bar]] was the largest seaport located in Montenegro.\n\n==Holidays==\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|+<big>'''Holidays'''</big>\n|-\n! style=\"background: #efefef; border-bottom: 2px solid gray;\" | Date\n! style=\"background: #efefef; border-bottom: 2px solid gray;\" | Name\n! style=\"background: #efefef; border-bottom: 2px solid gray;\" | Notes\n|-\n| 1 January\n| [[New Year's Day]]\n| (non-working holiday)\n|-\n| 7 January\n| [[Eastern Orthodox|Orthodox]] [[Christmas]]\n| (non-working)\n|-\n| 27 January\n| [[Saint Sava]]'s feast Day \u2014 Day of Spirituality\n|\n|-\n| 27 April\n| [[Constitution Day]]\n|\n|-\n| 29 April\n| Orthodox [[Good Friday]]\n| Date for 2005 only\n|-\n| 1 May\n| Orthodox [[Easter]]\n| Date for 2005 only\n|-\n| 2 May\n| Orthodox [[Easter Monday]]\n| Date for 2005 only\n|-\n| 1 May\n| [[Labour Day]]\n| (non-working)\n|-\n| 9 May\n| [[Victory Day]]\n|\n|-\n| 28 June\n| [[Vidovdan]] ([[Martyr]]'s Day)\n| In memory of soldiers fallen at the [[Battle of Kosovo]]\n|}\n\n;Holidays celebrated only in Serbia\n* 15 February \u2013 Sretenje ([[National Day]], non-working)\n\n;Holidays celebrated only in Montenegro\n* 13 July \u2013 Statehood Day (non-working)\n\n==Proposed national flag and state anthem==\n[[File:Proposed flag of Serbia and Montenegro (2003).svg|thumb|2003 proposed flag for Serbia and Montenegro]]\n\nAfter the formation of Serbia and Montenegro, the Yugoslav tricolour was to be replaced by a new compromise flag.

Among the flag proposals, the popular choice was a flag with a shade of blue in between the Serbian tricolor and the Montenegrin tricolor of 1993 through 2004. The color shade Pantone 300C was perceived as the best choice.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031009024659/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/3170416.stm|title=Belgrade flag flap reveals identity crisis|work=BBC News|location=United Kingdom|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation|access-date=9 October 2003|date=7 October 2003|first=Matthew|last=Price}}</ref> However the parliament failed to vote on the proposal within the legal time-frame and the flag was not adopted. In 2004, Montenegro adopted a radically different flag, as its independence-leaning government sought to distance itself from Serbia. Proposals for a compromise flag were dropped after this and the Union of Serbia and Montenegro never adopted a flag.\n\nA similar fate befell the country's state anthem and coat-of-arms to be; the above-mentioned Article 23 also stipulated that a law determining the State Union's flag and anthem was to be passed by the end of 2003. The official proposal for a state anthem was a combination piece consisting of one verse of the former (now current) Serbian national anthem \"[[Bo\u017ee pravde]]\" followed by a verse of the Montenegrin folk song, \"[[Oj, svijetla majska zoro]]\". This proposal was dropped after some public opposition, notably by Serbian Patriarch [[Serbian Patriarch Pavle II|Pavle]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vreme.com/cms/view.php?id=387870|title=Nova drzavna himna: Boze zore|publisher=Vreme|accessdate=26 August 2010}}</ref> Another legal deadline passed and no state anthem was adopted. Serious proposals for the coat of arms were never put forward, probably because the coat of arms of the FRY, adopted in 1994 combining Serbian and Montenegrin heraldic elements, was considered adequate.\n\nThus, the State Union never officially adopted state symbols and continued to use the flag and national anthem of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia by inertia until its dissolution in 2006.\n\n==Sports==\n\n===Association football===\n{{Main|Football Association of Serbia and Montenegro}}\n\nFR Yugoslavia, later Serbia and Montenegro, was considered by [[FIFA]] and [[UEFA]] to be the only successor-state of Yugoslavia.<ref>[http://www.fss.rs/sr/savez/istorijat.html History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111227044239/http://www.fss.rs/sr/savez/istorijat.html |date=27 December 2011 }} at FSS official website, Retrieved 4 October 2012 {{in lang|sr}}</ref><ref name=\"FIFA\">[http://fifa.com/associations/association=srb/index.html Serbia] at [[FIFA]] official website</ref><ref>[http://www.uefa.com/under17/news/newsid=1610531.html News: Serbia] at [[UEFA]] official website, published 1 January 2011, Retrieved 4 October 2012</ref> Football was experiencing major success during the 1980s and early 1990s, however due to the imposed economic sanctions, the country was excluded from all international competitions between 1992 and 1996. After the sanctions were lifted, the national team qualified for two [[FIFA World Cup]]s\u2014in [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998]] as FR Yugoslavia and in [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006]] as Serbia and Montenegro. It also qualified for [[Euro 2000]].\n\nThe 1998 World Cup appearance in France was accompanied with plenty of expectation and quiet confidence as the team was considered to be one of the tournament's dark horses due to being stacked with proven world-class players such as 29-year-old [[Predrag Mijatovi\u0107]], 33-year-old [[Dragan Stojkovi\u0107]], 29-year-old [[Sini\u0161a Mihajlovi\u0107]], 28-year-old [[Vladimir Jugovi\u0107]], and 31-year-old [[Dejan Savi\u0107evi\u0107]], as well as emerging 19-year-old youngster [[Dejan Stankovi\u0107]], and tall 24-year-old target forwards [[Savo Milo\u0161evi\u0107]] and [[Darko Kova\u010devi\u0107]]. Another reason for heightened expectations was the fact this was the country's first major international appearance following the UN-imposed exile. However, the talented squad never managed to hit top gear\u2014although it did make it out of the group, it got eliminated by the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] via an injury-time goal in the round-of-16. Two years later at Euro 2000, virtually the same team again made it out of the group and was again eliminated out of the tournament by the Netherlands, this time convincingly 1\u20136 in the quarter finals.\n\nThe country was also represented at the [[Yugoslavia at the 1996 Summer Olympics|1996 Summer Olympic Games]], the [[Yugoslavia at the 2000 Summer Olympics|2000 Summer Olympic Games]], and the [[Serbia and Montenegro at the 2004 Summer Olympics|2004 Summer Olympic Games]].\n\nSerbia and Montenegro were represented by [[Serbia and Montenegro national football team|a single national team]] in the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]] tournament, despite having formally split just weeks prior to its start. The final squad was made up of players born in both Serbia and Montenegro.\n\nThey played their last ever international on 21 June 2006, a 3\u20132 loss to [[Ivory Coast national football team|Ivory Coast]]. Following the World Cup, this team has been inherited by Serbia, while a [[Montenegro national football team|new one]] was to be organized to represent Montenegro in future international competitions.\n\n===Basketball===\nThe [[Serbia and Montenegro national basketball team|senior men's basketball team]] dominated European and world basketball during the mid-to-late 1990s and early 2000s, with three [[EuroBasket]] titles ([[1995 EuroBasket|1995]], [[1997 EuroBasket|1997]], and [[2001 EuroBasket|2001]]), two [[FIBA World Cup]] titles ([[1998 FIBA World Championship|1998]] and [[2002 FIBA World Championship|2002]]), and a [[Basketball at the Summer Olympics|Summer Olympic Games]] silver medal ([[Basketball at the 1996 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's tournament|1996]]).\n\nThe national team started competing internationally in 1995, after a three-year exile, due to a UN trade embargo. During that time, FR Yugoslavia was not allowed to compete at the [[Basketball at the 1992 Summer Olympics|1992 Summer Olympics]] in [[Barcelona]], the [[1993 EuroBasket]], and also the [[1994 FIBA World Championship]], which was originally supposed to be hosted by [[Belgrade]], before being taken away from the city and moved to [[Toronto|Toronto, Canada]].\n\nAt the [[1995 EuroBasket]] in [[Athens]], its first international competition, the hungry and highly motivated FR Yugoslav team, which was led by head coach [[Du\u0161an Ivkovi\u0107]], featured a starting five full of world-class talent, with established European stars at positions [[point guard|one]] through [[power forward (basketball)|four]] \u2014 27-year-old [[Sa\u0161a \u0110or\u0111evi\u0107]], 25-year-old [[Predrag Danilovi\u0107]], 29-year-old [[\u017darko Paspalj]], 22-year-old [[Dejan Bodiroga]] \u2014 capped off with 27-year-old [[Vlade Divac]], the starting center for the [[LA Lakers]] at the [[center (basketball)|five]] position. With a bench that was just as capable \u2014 with experienced [[Zoran Sretenovi\u0107]] (the only player over 30 in the team), [[Sa\u0161a Obradovi\u0107]], talisman power forward [[Zoran Savi\u0107]], and up-and-coming young center [[\u017deljko Rebra\u010da]] \u2014 the team rampaged through its preliminary group, which featured medal contenders [[Greek national basketball team|Greece]] and [[Lithuania men's national basketball team|Lithuania]], with a 6\u20130 record. At the first direct elimination stage, the quarterfinals, FR Yugoslavia scored 104 points to destroy [[French national basketball team|France]], thus setting up a semifinal clash with the tournament hosts Greece. In the highly charged atmosphere of the [[O.A.C.A. Olympic Indoor Hall|OAKA Indoor Arena]], the FR Yugoslav team demonstrated its versatility, using defensive prowess in that game to pull off a famous eight-point win, in a tense, low-scoring 60\u201352 game. In the final, FR Yugoslavia played against the experienced Lithuanian team, which was led by basketball legend [[Arvydas Sabonis]], in addition to other world class players like [[\u0160ar\u016bnas Mar\u010diulionis]], [[Rimas Kurtinaitis]], and [[Valdemaras Chomi\u010dius]]. The final became a classic game of international basketball, with the crafty Yugoslavs prevailing, by a score of 96\u201390, behind \u0110or\u0111evi\u0107's 41 points.\n\nThey were represented by a single team at the [[2006 FIBA World Championship]] as well, even though tournament was played in mid/late-August and early-September of that year, and the Serbia\u2013Montenegro breakup had occurred in May. That team was also inherited by [[Serbia]] after the tournament, while [[Montenegro]] created a separate senior national basketball team afterwards, as well as their own national teams in all other team sports.\n\n==Entertainment==\nSerbia and Montenegro was represented in the [[Miss Earth 2006]] pageant by a single delegate, Dubravka Skoric.\n\nSerbia and Montenegro also participated in the [[Eurovision Song Contest]] on two occasions and in [[Junior Eurovision Song Contest 2005]] only on one occasion. The country debuted in the Eurovision Song Contest under the name Serbia and Montenegro in 2004, when [[\u017deljko Joksimovi\u0107]] got 2nd place. The next to follow was the Montenegrin boyband No Name. In 2006, the year of Montenegrin independence, the country Serbia and Montenegro did not have a representative due to the scandal in [[Evropesma#2006 event and controversy|Evropesma 2006]].\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Serbia}}\n* [[List of national border changes since World War I]]\n* [[Military of Serbia and Montenegro]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Sources==\n* {{Cite book|ref=harv|editor-last=Batakovi\u0107|editor-first=Du\u0161an T.|editor-link=Du\u0161an T.

However this changed after 1997 when Milo\u0161evi\u0107's last legal term as Serbian President ended and he became Federal President that year, in which Milo\u0161evi\u0107 entrenched the power of the Federal Presidency.)</ref> Milo\u0161evi\u0107 installed and forced the removal of several federal presidents (such as [[Dobrica \u0106osi\u0107]]) and prime ministers (such as [[Milan Pani\u0107]]).<ref name=\"Sabrina P. Ramet 2005. Pp. 61\"/> However, the Montenegrin government, initially enthusiastic supporters of Milo\u0161evi\u0107, started gradually distancing themselves from his policies. That culminated in regime change in 1996, when his former ally [[Milo \u0110ukanovi\u0107]] reversed his policies, became leader of Montenegro's ruling party and subsequently dismissed former Montenegrin leader [[Momir Bulatovi\u0107]], who remained loyal to the Milo\u0161evi\u0107 government. As Bulatovi\u0107 was given central positions in [[Belgrade]] from that time (as federal Prime Minister), \u0110ukanovi\u0107 continued to govern Montenegro and further isolated it from Serbia. Thus from 1996 to 2006 Montenegro and Serbia were only nominally part of the same country as governance at every feasible level was conducted locally, in Belgrade for Serbia and in [[Podgorica]] for Montenegro.\n\nAs a loose union or confederacy, Montenegro and Serbia were united only in certain realms, such as defense and sports. The two constituent republics functioned separately throughout the period of the Federal Republic, and continued to operate under separate economic policies, as well as using separate currencies (the [[euro]] was the only legal tender in Montenegro). On 21 May 2006, the [[2006 Montenegrin independence referendum|Montenegrin independence referendum]] was held, in which 55.5% of voters voted in favor of independence. The last vestiges of the former Yugoslavia, 88 years after its creation, came to an end upon Montenegro's formal declaration of independence on 3 June 2006, and [[Serbia]]'s formal declaration of independence on 5 June. After the dissolution, Serbia became the [[Succession of states|legal successor]] of the union, while the newly [[Montenegro|independent Montenegro]] re-applied for membership in international organisations.\n\n==Etymology==\nOfficially, the country was known as the \"Federal Republic of Yugoslavia\" (\u0421\u0430\u0432\u0435\u0437\u043d\u0430 \u0420\u0435\u043f\u0443\u0431\u043b\u0438\u043a\u0430 \u0408\u0443\u0433\u043e\u0441\u043b\u0430\u0432\u0438\u0458\u0430 / ''Savezna Republika Jugoslavija'') from 1992 to 2003, or \"Yugoslavia\" for short. The name ''Yugoslavia'', an Anglicised transcription of ''Jugoslavija'', is a composite word made up of ''jug'' ('yug') (with the 'j' pronounced like an English 'y') and ''slavija''. The [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] word ''jug'' means 'south', while ''slavija'' ('Slavia\") denotes a 'land of the [[Slavs]]'. Thus, a translation of \"''Jugoslavija''\" would be 'South-Slavia' or '[[South Slavs|South Slav]] Land'.\n\nEven when Serbia and Montenegro was known officially as the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (or Yugoslavia for short), some countries, such as the United States, had referred to it as ''Serbia and Montenegro''<ref name=\"Serbia and Montenegro\">1999 [[CIA]] [[World Factbook]]: [http://www.umsl.edu/services/govdocs/wofact99/265.htm Serbia and Montenegro]</ref> as their governments viewed its claim to Yugoslavia's successorship as illegitimate.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20000816214535/http://www.cia.gov:80/cia/publications/factbook/sr.html|work=The World Factbook 1999|title=Serbia and Montenegro|date=16 August 2000|publisher=Central Intelligence Agency|location=Virginia}}</ref>\n\nThe 2003 constitution states that the name of the state was \"Serbia and Montenegro\".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090226024403/http://www.mfa.gov.rs/Facts/const_scg.pdf|title=Constitutional Charter of the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro|quote=The name of the state union shall be Serbia and Montenegro.|date=2003|access-date=26 February 2009}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{Main|Breakup of Yugoslavia}}\n\nWith the collapse of [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] during the 1990s, only the republics of [[Republic of Serbia (federal)|Serbia]] and [[Republic of Montenegro (federal)|Montenegro]] agreed to maintain the Yugoslav state, and established a new constitution for a new Yugoslavia in 1992. With the collapse of communism across Eastern Europe, the new state followed the wave of free market change. It abandoned communist symbolism: the [[red star]] was removed from the national flag, and the communist coat of arms was replaced by a white double-headed eagle with the arms of both Serbia and Montenegro within it. The new state also established the office of the [[President of Serbia and Montenegro|president]], held by a single person, initially appointed with the consent of the republics of Serbia and Montenegro until 1997 after which the president was democratically elected.\n\n===Foundation===\nWith the collapse of Yugoslavia and its institutions from 1991 to 1992, the issue of unity of the two republics remaining in the collapsing federation, Serbia, Montenegro, as well as Serb-majority territories in Croatia and Bosnia that wished to remain united, became an issue. In 1991 diplomatic talks chaired by Lord Carrington with the leaders of the six republics of the collapsing federation, resulted in all the republics except for Serbia agreeing that Yugoslavia had collapsed and that each republic should become an independent state. The Serbian government was surprised and outraged by Montenegro's decision in favor of terminating Yugoslavia, as the Bulatovic government had previously been closely allied with Milosevic's government in Serbia.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}} Yugoslavia's collapse began in 1991 when [[Slovenia]], [[Croatia]], and [[North Macedonia|Macedonia]] declared independence.\n\nOn 26 December 1991, Serbia, Montenegro, and the Serb rebel-held territories in Croatia agreed that they would form a new \"third Yugoslavia\".<ref>Sabrina P.

This was due to the ongoing [[Yugoslav wars]] during the 1990s, which had prevented agreement being reached on the disposition of federal assets and liabilities, particularly the national debt. The Government of Yugoslavia supported Croatian and Bosnian Serbs in the [[Yugoslav wars|wars]] from 1992 to 1995. Because of that, the country was under economic and political sanctions, which resulted in economic disaster that forced thousands of its young citizens to emigrate from the country.\n\nIn a [[BBC]] documentary, called ''[[The Death of Yugoslavia]]'', and later in his testimony before the [[International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia]] during the [[trial of Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107]], Yugoslav official [[Borisav Jovi\u0107]] revealed that the Bosnian Serb army arose from the Yugoslav army forces in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. He claimed that he had realized that Bosnia and Herzegovina was about to be recognized by the international community, and since [[Yugoslav People's Army]] troops were still located there at that point, their presence on Bosnian territory could have led to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia being accused of aggression. To avoid this, he and Milo\u0161evi\u0107 decided to move all JNA soldiers originating from Serbia and Montenegro back into Serbia and Montenegro, and to move all JNA soldiers of Bosnian Serb descent to Bosnia and Herzegovina.<ref name=\"youtube1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i5kD1FdxvIE|title=Bosnia: Who Lit the Fire?|publisher=YouTube|date=11 November 2007|accessdate=2010-08-26}}</ref> In this way, every Bosnian Serb was transferred from the Yugoslav army to what became the newly created Bosnian Serb army.

By 1998, simultaneously with Montenegrin Prime Minister [[Milo \u0110ukanovi\u0107]] coming out on top in the power struggle with Montenegrin President [[Momir Bulatovi\u0107]], the republic undertook a different [[economic policy]] by adopting the [[Deutsche Mark]] as its currency. During autumn 1999, following the Kosovo War and the NATO bombing campaign, \u0110ukanovi\u0107 (who by now firmly held power in Montenegro as Bulatovi\u0107 was completely squeezed out) drafted a document called ''Platforma za redefiniciju odnosa Crne Gore i Srbije'' (A platform for redefinition of relations within Montenegro and Serbia) calling for major changes in the division of governing responsibilities within FR Yugoslavia though still officially seeing Montenegro within a joint state with Serbia. Milo\u0161evi\u0107 did not respond to the platform, considering it unconstitutional. Political relations within the federal state became more and more strained, especially against the backdrop of the wave of assassinations against top figures from political, criminal, and state business circles in both republics ([[\u017deljko Ra\u017enatovi\u0107|\u017deljko \"Arkan\" Ra\u017enatovi\u0107]], [[Pavle Bulatovi\u0107]], [[\u017dika Petrovi\u0107]], and [[Goran \u017dugi\u0107]] as well as two attempts on the life of opposition politician [[Vuk Dra\u0161kovi\u0107]]). By October 2000 Milo\u0161evi\u0107 had lost power in Serbia. Contrary to expectation, \u0110ukanovi\u0107's response to the power change in Belgrade was not to further push the agenda outlined in his platform, but instead to suddenly start pushing for full independence, thus completely dropping the platform in the process. Subsequent governments of Montenegro carried out pro-independence policies, and political tensions with Serbia simmered despite political changes in Belgrade.\n\n====Kosovo War====\n{{Main|Kosovo War}}\n[[File:Zasto.jpg|thumb|The ''Za\u0161to?({{Lang-sr-Cyrl|\u0417\u0430\u0448\u0442\u043e}}'', \"Why?\") Monument, dedicated to the employees of the Radio Television of Serbia ([[Radio Television of Serbia|RTS]]) who were killed during NATO bombing of the RTS building in 1999]]\n\nWith Milo\u0161evi\u0107's second and last legal term as Serbian President expiring in 1997, he ran for, and was elected President of Yugoslavia in 1997. Upon taking office, Milo\u0161evi\u0107 gained direct control of the Yugoslav military and security forces, and directed them to engage Kosovar separatists. The conflict escalated from 1998 to 1999 and became known as the [[Kosovo War]].\n\n[[Military of Serbia and Montenegro|Yugoslav forces]] committed a series of atrocities in Kosovo. To prevent ethnic cleansing, the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO) under the leadership of the United States began an air campaign called [[Operation Allied Force]] against Yugoslav military forces and positions and suspected Serbian paramilitaries.<ref>{{cite book|last=Judah|title=The Serbs|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=978-0-300-15826-7}}</ref> The air attacks against Belgrade by NATO were the first attacks on the city since [[World War II]]. Some of the worst massacres against civilian Albanians by Serbian forces occurred after NATO started its bombing of Yugoslavia.

On 4 February 2003, the [[Parliament of Serbia and Montenegro|federal assembly of Yugoslavia]] created a loose [[state union]] or confederacy\u2014the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro, although Yugoslavia was still commonly used. A new [[Constitutional Charter of Serbia and Montenegro|constitutional charter]] was agreed to provide a framework for the governance of the country.\n\nOn Sunday, 21 May 2006, [[Montenegrins (ethnic group)|Montenegrins]] voted in an [[2006 Montenegrin independence referendum|independence referendum]], with 55.5% supporting independence. Fifty-five percent or more of affirmative votes were needed to dissolve the confederation and Yugoslavia. The turnout was 86.3% and 99.73% of the more than 477,000 votes cast were deemed valid.\n\nThe subsequent Montenegrin proclamation of independence on June 2006 and the Serbian proclamation of independence on 5 June ended the confederation of Yugoslavia and thus the last remaining vestiges of the former [[Yugoslavia]].\n\n==Politics==\n{{Main|Politics of Serbia and Montenegro}}\nThe Federal Assembly of the FRY (1992\u20132003) was composed of two chambers: the Council of Citizens and the Council of Republics. Whereas the Council of Citizens served as an ordinary assembly, representing the people of FRY, the Council of Republics was made equally by representatives from the federation's constituent republics, to ensure federal equality.\n\nThe status of leadership of the FRY president was unstable with no president lasting more than four years in office. The first president from 1992 to 1993 was [[Dobrica \u0106osi\u0107]], a former communist [[Yugoslav partisan]] during World War II and later one of the fringe contributors of the controversial [[Memorandum of the Serbian Academy of Sciences and Arts]]. Despite being head of the country, \u0106osi\u0107 was forced out of office in 1993 due to his opposition to Serbian President [[Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107]]. \u0106osi\u0107 was replaced by [[Zoran Lili\u0107]] who served from 1993 to 1997, and then followed by Milo\u0161evi\u0107 becoming Yugoslav President in 1997 after his last legal term as Serbian president ended in 1997. The presidential election in 2000 was accused of being the result of vote fraud. Yugoslav citizens took to the streets and engaged in [[Overthrow of Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107|riots in Belgrade]] demanding that Milo\u0161evi\u0107 be removed from power. Shortly afterwards Milo\u0161evi\u0107 resigned and [[Vojislav Ko\u0161tunica]] took over as Yugoslav president and remained president until the state's reconstitution as the State Union of Serbia and Montenegro.\n\nFederal Prime Minister [[Milan Pani\u0107]] became frustrated with Milo\u0161evi\u0107's domineering behaviour during diplomatic talks in 1992, and told Milo\u0161evi\u0107 to \"shut up\" because Milo\u0161evi\u0107's position was officially subordinate to his position.<ref>James Gow.

Pp. 61\"/>\n\nAfter the federation was reconstituted as a state union, the new [[Parliament of Serbia and Montenegro|Assembly of the State Union]] was created. It was unicameral and was made up of 126 deputies, of which 91 were from Serbia and 35 were from Montenegro. The Assembly convened in the building of the old Federal Assembly of FRY, which now houses the [[National Assembly of Serbia]].\n\nIn 2003, after the constitutional changes and creation of the [[State Union of Serbia and Montenegro]], a new [[President of Serbia and Montenegro]] was elected. He was also president of the [[Council of Ministers of Serbia and Montenegro]].\n[[Svetozar Marovi\u0107]] was the first and last President of Serbia and Montenegro until its breakup in 2006.\n\n== Armed Forces of Serbia and Montenegro ==\nThe [[Armed Forces of Serbia and Montenegro]] ([[Serbian language|Serbian]]: \u0412\u043e\u0458\u0441\u043a\u0430 \u0421\u0440\u0431\u0438\u0458\u0435 \u0438 \u0426\u0440\u043d\u0435 \u0413\u043e\u0440\u0435/Vojska Srbije i Crne Gore; \u0412\u0421\u0426\u0413/VSCG) included ground forces with internal and border troops, [[Navy|naval forces]], [[Air force|air and air defense forces]], and [[civil defense]].

It had two autonomous provinces: [[Kosovo and Metohija]] in the south (with 30 municipalities), which was under the administration of [[UNMIK]] after 1999, and [[Vojvodina]] in the north (with 46 municipalities and 1 city). The territory between Kosovo and Vojvodina was called [[Central Serbia]]. Central Serbia was not an administrative division on its own and had no regional government of its own.\n\nIn addition, there were four cities: Belgrade, [[Ni\u0161]], [[Novi Sad]] and [[Kragujevac]], each having an assembly and budget of its own. The cities comprised several municipalities, divided into \"urban\" (in the city proper) and \"other\" (suburban). Competences of cities and their municipalities were divided.\n\nMunicipalities were gathered into [[Districts of Serbia|districts]], which are regional centres of state authority, but have no assemblies of their own; they present purely administrative divisions, and host various state institutions such as funds, office branches and courts. The Republic of Serbia was then and is still today divided into 29 districts (17 in Central Serbia, 7 in Vojvodina and 5 in Kosovo, which are now defunct), while the city of Belgrade presents a district of its own.\n\n===Montenegro===\nMontenegro was divided into [[Municipalities of Montenegro|21 municipalities]].\n\n==Geography==\n{{see also|Geography of Serbia|Geography of Montenegro}}\nSerbia and Montenegro had an area of 102,350 square kilometres (39,518&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi), with 199 kilometres (124&nbsp;mi) of coastline. The terrain of the two republics is extremely varied, with much of Serbia comprising plains and low hills (except in the more mountainous region of Kosovo and Metohija) and much of Montenegro consisting of high mountains. Serbia is entirely landlocked, with the coastline belonging to Montenegro. The climate is similarly varied. The north has a [[continental climate]] (cold winters and hot summers); the central region has a combination of a continental and [[Mediterranean climate]]; the southern region had an [[Adriatic sea|Adriatic climate]] along the coast, with inland regions experiencing hot, dry summers and autumns and relatively cold winters with heavy snowfall inland.\n\n[[Belgrade]], with its population of 1,574,050, is the largest city in the two nations: and the only one of significant size. The country's other principal cities were [[Novi Sad]], [[Ni\u0161]], [[Kragujevac]], [[Podgorica]], [[Subotica]], [[Pristina]], and [[Prizren]], each with populations of about 100,000\u2013250,000 people.\n\n==Demographics==\n{{Main|Demographics of Serbia and Montenegro}}\n\nSerbia and Montenegro had more demographic variety than most other European countries. The three largest named nationalities were [[Serbs]] (62.3%), [[Albanians]] (16.6%) and [[Montenegrins (ethnic group)|Montenegrins]] (5%) according to the 1991 census. The country also had significant populations of [[Hungarians]], [[Yugoslavs]], [[Muslims by nationality|Muslims (ethnic group)]], [[Romani people|Roma]], [[Croats]], [[Bulgarians]], [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|Macedonians]], [[Romanians]], [[Vlachs of Serbia|Vlachs]] and others (under 1%). Most of the ethnic diversity was situated in the provinces of [[Kosovo]] and [[Vojvodina]], where smaller numbers of other minority groups could be found. The large [[Albania]]n population was chiefly concentrated in [[Kosovo]], with smaller populations in the [[Pre\u0161evo Valley]], and in the [[Ulcinj]] municipality. The ''Muslims'' (Slavic Muslims, including [[Bosniaks]]) population lived mostly in the [[Sand\u017eak|federal border region]] (mainly [[Novi Pazar]] in Serbia, and [[Ro\u017eaje]] in Montenegro).\n\n;Total Serbia-Montenegro \u2013 10,019,657\n* [[Republic of Serbia (federal)|Serbia]] (total): 9,396,411\n** Vojvodina: 2,116,725\n** Central Serbia: 5,479,686\n** Kosovo: 1,800,000\n* [[Republic of Montenegro (federal)|Montenegro]]: 623,246\n* Major cities (over 100,000 inhabitants) \u2013 2002 data (2003 for Podgorica):\n** [[Beograd]] (Belgrade): 1,280,639 (1,574,050 metro)\n** [[Novi Sad]]: 215,600 (298,139 metro)\n** [[Pristina]]: 200,000 (2002 estimate)\n** [[Ni\u0161]]: 173,390 (234,863 metro)\n** [[Kragujevac]]: 145,890 (175,182 metro)\n** [[Podgorica]]: 139,500 (169,000 metro)\n** [[Prizren]]: 121,000 (2002 estimate)\n** [[Subotica]]: 99,471 (147,758 metro)\n\nAccording to a 2004 estimate the State Union had 10,825,900 inhabitants.\n\nAccording to a July 2006 estimate, the State Union had 10,832,545 inhabitants.\n\n==Economy==\n{{Main|Economy of Serbia and Montenegro}}\nThe state suffered significantly economically due to the breakup of Yugoslavia and mismanagement of the economy, and an extended period of economic sanctions. In the early 1990s, the FRY suffered from [[hyperinflation]] of the Yugoslav dinar. By the mid-1990s, the FRY had overcome the inflation. Further damage to Yugoslavia's infrastructure and industry caused by the [[Kosovo War]] left the economy only half the size it was in 1990. Since the ousting of former Federal Yugoslav President [[Slobodan Milo\u0161evi\u0107]] in October 2000, the [[Democratic Opposition of Serbia]] (DOS) coalition government has implemented stabilization measures and embarked on an aggressive market reform program. After renewing its membership in the [[International Monetary Fund]] in December 2000, Yugoslavia continued to reintegrate with other world nations by rejoining the [[World Bank]] and the [[European Bank for Reconstruction and Development]].\n<!--\nPLEASE REWRITE AND UPDATE THIS PART SO THAT IT IS APPLICABLE TO THE FEDERAL REPUBLIC OF YUGOSLAVIA.\nA World Bank-[[European Commission]] sponsored Donors' Conference held in June 2001 raised $1.3 billion for economic restructuring. An agreement rescheduling the country's $4.5 billion [[Paris Club]] government debts was concluded in November 2001; it will write off 66% of the debt; a similar debt relief agreement on its $2.8 billion [[London Club]] commercial debt has been reached in July 2004; 62% of the debt have been written off. -->\n\nThe smaller republic of [[Montenegro]] severed its economy from federal control and from Serbia during the Milo\u0161evi\u0107 era. Afterwards, the two republics had separate central banks whilst Montenegro began to use different currencies \u2013 it first adopted the [[Deutsch mark]], and continued to use it until the mark fell into disuse to be replaced by the [[euro]]. Serbia continued to use the Yugoslav Dinar, renaming it the ''[[Serbian dinar]]''.<!-- rewrite as part of history\nThe southern Serbian province of [[Kosovo]], while formally still part of Serbia (according to United Nations Security Council Resolution 1244), is moving toward local autonomy under the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo ([[UNMIK]]) and is dependent on the international community for financial and technical assistance. The euro is official currency, and UNMIK collects taxes and manages the budget. -->\n\nThe complexity of the FRY's political relationships, slow progress in privatisation, and stagnation in the European economy were detrimental to the economy. Arrangements with the IMF, especially requirements for fiscal discipline, were an important element in policy formation. Severe unemployment was a key political and economic problem. Corruption also presented a major problem, with a large [[black market]] and a high degree of criminal involvement in the formal economy.\n\n==Transport==\n[[File:Passport of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.jpg|thumb|upright|A Federal Republic of Yugoslavia passport]]\n\nSerbia, and in particular the valley of the [[Morava River, Serbia|Morava]] is often described as \"the crossroads between the [[Eastern world|East]] and the [[Western world|West]]\" \u2013 one of the primary reasons for its turbulent history. The valley is by far the easiest land route from continental Europe to Greece and [[Asia Minor]].\n\nMajor [[European route|international highways]] going through Serbia were [[European route E75|E75]] and [[European route E70|E70]]. [[European route E763|E763]]/[[European route E761|E761]] was the most important route connecting Serbia with Montenegro.\n\nThe [[Danube]], an important international waterway, flowed through Serbia.\n\nThe [[Port of Bar]] was the largest seaport located in Montenegro.\n\n==Holidays==\n{|class=\"wikitable\"\n|+<big>'''Holidays'''</big>\n|-\n! style=\"background: #efefef; border-bottom: 2px solid gray;\" | Date\n! style=\"background: #efefef; border-bottom: 2px solid gray;\" | Name\n! style=\"background: #efefef; border-bottom: 2px solid gray;\" | Notes\n|-\n| 1 January\n| [[New Year's Day]]\n| (non-working holiday)\n|-\n| 7 January\n| [[Eastern Orthodox|Orthodox]] [[Christmas]]\n| (non-working)\n|-\n| 27 January\n| [[Saint Sava]]'s feast Day \u2014 Day of Spirituality\n|\n|-\n| 27 April\n| [[Constitution Day]]\n|\n|-\n| 29 April\n| Orthodox [[Good Friday]]\n| Date for 2005 only\n|-\n| 1 May\n| Orthodox [[Easter]]\n| Date for 2005 only\n|-\n| 2 May\n| Orthodox [[Easter Monday]]\n| Date for 2005 only\n|-\n| 1 May\n| [[Labour Day]]\n| (non-working)\n|-\n| 9 May\n| [[Victory Day]]\n|\n|-\n| 28 June\n| [[Vidovdan]] ([[Martyr]]'s Day)\n| In memory of soldiers fallen at the [[Battle of Kosovo]]\n|}\n\n;Holidays celebrated only in Serbia\n* 15 February \u2013 Sretenje ([[National Day]], non-working)\n\n;Holidays celebrated only in Montenegro\n* 13 July \u2013 Statehood Day (non-working)\n\n==Proposed national flag and state anthem==\n[[File:Proposed flag of Serbia and Montenegro (2003).svg|thumb|2003 proposed flag for Serbia and Montenegro]]\n\nAfter the formation of Serbia and Montenegro, the Yugoslav tricolour was to be replaced by a new compromise flag. Article 23 of the Law for the implementation of the Constitutional Charter<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ssinf.sv.gov.yu/default.php?id=87&je= |title=Zakon o sprovo\u0111enju Ustavne povelje |accessdate=2007-07-12 |url-status=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929155125/http://www.ssinf.sv.gov.yu/default.php?id=87&je= |archivedate=29 September 2007 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> stated that a law specifying the new flag was to be passed within 60 days of the first session of the new joint parliament. Among the flag proposals, the popular choice was a flag with a shade of blue in between the Serbian tricolor and the Montenegrin tricolor of 1993 through 2004. The color shade Pantone 300C was perceived as the best choice.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031009024659/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/3170416.stm|title=Belgrade flag flap reveals identity crisis|work=BBC News|location=United Kingdom|publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation|access-date=9 October 2003|date=7 October 2003|first=Matthew|last=Price}}</ref> However the parliament failed to vote on the proposal within the legal time-frame and the flag was not adopted. In 2004, Montenegro adopted a radically different flag, as its independence-leaning government sought to distance itself from Serbia. Proposals for a compromise flag were dropped after this and the Union of Serbia and Montenegro never adopted a flag.\n\nA similar fate befell the country's state anthem and coat-of-arms to be; the above-mentioned Article 23 also stipulated that a law determining the State Union's flag and anthem was to be passed by the end of 2003. The official proposal for a state anthem was a combination piece consisting of one verse of the former (now current) Serbian national anthem \"[[Bo\u017ee pravde]]\" followed by a verse of the Montenegrin folk song, \"[[Oj, svijetla majska zoro]]\". This proposal was dropped after some public opposition, notably by Serbian Patriarch [[Serbian Patriarch Pavle II|Pavle]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vreme.com/cms/view.php?id=387870|title=Nova drzavna himna: Boze zore|publisher=Vreme|accessdate=26 August 2010}}</ref> Another legal deadline passed and no state anthem was adopted. Serious proposals for the coat of arms were never put forward, probably because the coat of arms of the FRY, adopted in 1994 combining Serbian and Montenegrin heraldic elements, was considered adequate.\n\nThus, the State Union never officially adopted state symbols and continued to use the flag and national anthem of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia by inertia until its dissolution in 2006.\n\n==Sports==\n\n===Association football===\n{{Main|Football Association of Serbia and Montenegro}}\n\nFR Yugoslavia, later Serbia and Montenegro, was considered by [[FIFA]] and [[UEFA]] to be the only successor-state of Yugoslavia.<ref>[http://www.fss.rs/sr/savez/istorijat.html History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111227044239/http://www.fss.rs/sr/savez/istorijat.html |date=27 December 2011 }} at FSS official website, Retrieved 4 October 2012 {{in lang|sr}}</ref><ref name=\"FIFA\">[http://fifa.com/associations/association=srb/index.html Serbia] at [[FIFA]] official website</ref><ref>[http://www.uefa.com/under17/news/newsid=1610531.html News: Serbia] at [[UEFA]] official website, published 1 January 2011, Retrieved 4 October 2012</ref> Football was experiencing major success during the 1980s and early 1990s, however due to the imposed economic sanctions, the country was excluded from all international competitions between 1992 and 1996. After the sanctions were lifted, the national team qualified for two [[FIFA World Cup]]s\u2014in [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998]] as FR Yugoslavia and in [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006]] as Serbia and Montenegro. It also qualified for [[Euro 2000]].\n\nThe 1998 World Cup appearance in France was accompanied with plenty of expectation and quiet confidence as the team was considered to be one of the tournament's dark horses due to being stacked with proven world-class players such as 29-year-old [[Predrag Mijatovi\u0107]], 33-year-old [[Dragan Stojkovi\u0107]], 29-year-old [[Sini\u0161a Mihajlovi\u0107]], 28-year-old [[Vladimir Jugovi\u0107]], and 31-year-old [[Dejan Savi\u0107evi\u0107]], as well as emerging 19-year-old youngster [[Dejan Stankovi\u0107]], and tall 24-year-old target forwards [[Savo Milo\u0161evi\u0107]] and [[Darko Kova\u010devi\u0107]]. Another reason for heightened expectations was the fact this was the country's first major international appearance following the UN-imposed exile. However, the talented squad never managed to hit top gear\u2014although it did make it out of the group, it got eliminated by the [[Netherlands national football team|Netherlands]] via an injury-time goal in the round-of-16. Two years later at Euro 2000, virtually the same team again made it out of the group and was again eliminated out of the tournament by the Netherlands, this time convincingly 1\u20136 in the quarter finals.\n\nThe country was also represented at the [[Yugoslavia at the 1996 Summer Olympics|1996 Summer Olympic Games]], the [[Yugoslavia at the 2000 Summer Olympics|2000 Summer Olympic Games]], and the [[Serbia and Montenegro at the 2004 Summer Olympics|2004 Summer Olympic Games]].\n\nSerbia and Montenegro were represented by [[Serbia and Montenegro national football team|a single national team]] in the [[2006 FIFA World Cup]] tournament, despite having formally split just weeks prior to its start. The final squad was made up of players born in both Serbia and Montenegro.\n\nThey played their last ever international on 21 June 2006, a 3\u20132 loss to [[Ivory Coast national football team|Ivory Coast]]. Following the World Cup, this team has been inherited by Serbia, while a [[Montenegro national football team|new one]] was to be organized to represent Montenegro in future international competitions.\n\n===Basketball===\nThe [[Serbia and Montenegro national basketball team|senior men's basketball team]] dominated European and world basketball during the mid-to-late 1990s and early 2000s, with three [[EuroBasket]] titles ([[1995 EuroBasket|1995]], [[1997 EuroBasket|1997]], and [[2001 EuroBasket|2001]]), two [[FIBA World Cup]] titles ([[1998 FIBA World Championship|1998]] and [[2002 FIBA World Championship|2002]]), and a [[Basketball at the Summer Olympics|Summer Olympic Games]] silver medal ([[Basketball at the 1996 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's tournament|1996]]).\n\nThe national team started competing internationally in 1995, after a three-year exile, due to a UN trade embargo. During that time, FR Yugoslavia was not allowed to compete at the [[Basketball at the 1992 Summer Olympics|1992 Summer Olympics]] in [[Barcelona]], the [[1993 EuroBasket]], and also the [[1994 FIBA World Championship]], which was originally supposed to be hosted by [[Belgrade]], before being taken away from the city and moved to [[Toronto|Toronto, Canada]].\n\nAt the [[1995 EuroBasket]] in [[Athens]], its first international competition, the hungry and highly motivated FR Yugoslav team, which was led by head coach [[Du\u0161an Ivkovi\u0107]], featured a starting five full of world-class talent, with established European stars at positions [[point guard|one]] through [[power forward (basketball)|four]] \u2014 27-year-old [[Sa\u0161a \u0110or\u0111evi\u0107]], 25-year-old [[Predrag Danilovi\u0107]], 29-year-old [[\u017darko Paspalj]], 22-year-old [[Dejan Bodiroga]] \u2014 capped off with 27-year-old [[Vlade Divac]], the starting center for the [[LA Lakers]] at the [[center (basketball)|five]] position. With a bench that was just as capable \u2014 with experienced [[Zoran Sretenovi\u0107]] (the only player over 30 in the team), [[Sa\u0161a Obradovi\u0107]], talisman power forward [[Zoran Savi\u0107]], and up-and-coming young center [[\u017deljko Rebra\u010da]] \u2014 the team rampaged through its preliminary group, which featured medal contenders [[Greek national basketball team|Greece]] and [[Lithuania men's national basketball team|Lithuania]], with a 6\u20130 record. At the first direct elimination stage, the quarterfinals, FR Yugoslavia scored 104 points to destroy [[French national basketball team|France]], thus setting up a semifinal clash with the tournament hosts Greece. In the highly charged atmosphere of the [[O.A.C.A. Olympic Indoor Hall|OAKA Indoor Arena]], the FR Yugoslav team demonstrated its versatility, using defensive prowess in that game to pull off a famous eight-point win, in a tense, low-scoring 60\u201352 game. In the final, FR Yugoslavia played against the experienced Lithuanian team, which was led by basketball legend [[Arvydas Sabonis]], in addition to other world class players like [[\u0160ar\u016bnas Mar\u010diulionis]], [[Rimas Kurtinaitis]], and [[Valdemaras Chomi\u010dius]]. The final became a classic game of international basketball, with the crafty Yugoslavs prevailing, by a score of 96\u201390, behind \u0110or\u0111evi\u0107's 41 points.\n\nThey were represented by a single team at the [[2006 FIBA World Championship]] as well, even though tournament was played in mid/late-August and early-September of that year, and the Serbia\u2013Montenegro breakup had occurred in May. That team was also inherited by [[Serbia]] after the tournament, while [[Montenegro]] created a separate senior national basketball team afterwards, as well as their own national teams in all other team sports.\n\n==Entertainment==\nSerbia and Montenegro was represented in the [[Miss Earth 2006]] pageant by a single delegate, Dubravka Skoric.\n\nSerbia and Montenegro also participated in the [[Eurovision Song Contest]] on two occasions and in [[Junior Eurovision Song Contest 2005]] only on one occasion. The country debuted in the Eurovision Song Contest under the name Serbia and Montenegro in 2004, when [[\u017deljko Joksimovi\u0107]] got 2nd place. The next to follow was the Montenegrin boyband No Name. In 2006, the year of Montenegrin independence, the country Serbia and Montenegro did not have a representative due to the scandal in [[Evropesma#2006 event and controversy|Evropesma 2006]].\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Serbia}}\n* [[List of national border changes since World War I]]\n* [[Military of Serbia and Montenegro]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Sources==\n* {{Cite book|ref=harv|editor-last=Batakovi\u0107|editor-first=Du\u0161an T.|editor-link=Du\u0161an T.

Buddhism can be traced back to before the formation of the Tibetan Empire. The region has a number of surviving Buddhist archaeological sites. These include the [[Manthal Buddha Rock]], a rock relief of the [[Buddha]] at the edge of the village (near Skardu) and the [[Sacred Rock of Hunza]]. Nearby are former sites of Buddhist shelters.\n\nBaltistan had Buddhist majority till the 15th century, before the arrival of Islam in this region. Since then most of the people converted to Islam, the presence of Buddhism in this region has now been limited to archeological sites, as the remaining  Buddhists of this region moved east to [[ladakh]] where Buddhism is the majority religion.\n\n==== Gandhara ====\nThe majority of people in [[Gandhara]], present-day Southern [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]] province, were Buddhist. Gandhara was largely [[Mahayana]] Buddhist, but also a stronghold of [[Vajrayana]] Buddhism. The [[Swat, Pakistan|Swat]] Valley, known in antiquity as Uddiyana, was a kingdom tributary to Gandhara. There are many archaeological sites from the Buddhist era in Swat. Buddhist scholar Kum\u0101ralabdha of the [[Ruins at Taxila|Taxila]] was comparable to [[Aryadeva]], [[A\u015bvagho\u1e63a]]<nowiki/>and [[Nagarjuna]].\n\n==== Uddiyana ====\nThe Buddhist sage [[Padmasambhava]] is said to have been born in a village near the present day town of Chakdara in [[Lower Dir District]], which was then a part of [[Oddiyana]]. Padmasambhava is known as Guru Rinpoche in Tibetan and it is he who introduced Vajrayana Buddhism in Tibet.\n\n==== Punjab region ====\nBuddhism was practiced in the [[Punjab region]], with many [[Buddhist monastery]] and [[stupa]] sites in the [[Taxila]] [[World Heritage Site]] locale. It was also practiced in the [[Sindh]] regions.\n\n==== Sindh ====\nBuddhist sites in Sindh are numerous but ill preserved and various stages of deterioration. Sites at [[Mansura (Brahmanabad)|Brahmanabad]] (Mansura Sanghar district, Buddhist stupa at [[Mohenjo-daro|mohen jo daro]], [[Siraj-ji-Takri|Sirah-ji-takri]] near Rohri, Sukkur, [[Kahu-Jo-Darro|Kahu Jo Daro]] at Mirpur Khas, Nawabshah, Sudheran jo Thul near Hyderabad, [[Thul Mir Rukan]] stupa, [[Thul Hairo Khan (Buddhist Stupa)|Thul Hairo Khan Stupa]] and Bhaleel Shah Thul square stupas (5th-7th century A.D) at [[Dadu District|Dadu]], Kot Bambhan Thul buddhist tower near Tando Muhammad Khan.

He is also a councillor for Chak number 75 DB, Union Council number 88. He also twice contested elections for the Punjab assembly.<ref name=\"thefridaytimes.com\"/>\n\n==Islam and Hinduism==\nGandhara remained a largely Hindu-Buddhist land until around 10th century CE, when [[Mahmud of Ghazni|Sultan Mahmud]] conquered the region and introduced [[Islam]]. There was settlement of Muslims and the emigration of Hindu-Buddhists.<ref>Ousel, M. (1997). Ancient india and indian civilization. Routledge.</ref>\n[[File:Thul Mir Rukan.jpg|thumb|Thul Mir Rukan stupa near Dadu, Sindh]]\nMost Buddhists in [[Punjab region|Punjab]], [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]] and [[Sindh]] were in process of converting to [[Hinduism]] from 600 CE onwards. Buddhism was practiced by the majority of the population of Sindh up to the [[Arab people|Arab]] conquest by the [[Umayyad Caliphate]] in 710 CE. These regions became predominantly [[Muslim]] during the rule of [[Delhi Sultanate]] and later the [[Mughal Empire]] due to the [[Dua|missionary]] [[Sufi]] saints whose [[dargah]]s (shrines) dot the landscape of [[Pakistan]] and the rest of [[South Asia]].\n\n== Pakistan Buddhist tourism ==\nIn March 2013, a group of around 20 Buddhist monks from South Korea made the journey to the monastery of Takht-e-Bahi, 170 kilometres (106 miles) from [[Islamabad]]. The monks defied appeals from Seoul to abandon their trip for safety reasons and were guarded by Pakistani security forces on their visit to the monastery, built of ochre-coloured stone and nestled on a mountainside. From around 1,000 years BC until the seventh century AD, northern Pakistan and parts of modern Afghanistan formed the Gandhara kingdom, where Greek and Buddhist customs mixed to create what became the Mahayana strand of the religion. The monk Marananta set out from what is now northwest Pakistan to cross China and spread Buddhism on the Korean peninsula during the fourth century. The authorities are even planning package tours for visitors from China, Japan, Singapore and South Korea, including trips to the Buddhist sites at Takht-e-Bahi, Swat, Peshawar and Taxila, near Islamabad.<ref>{{cite news|title=Pakistan hopes for Buddhist tourism boost|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/796713/pakistan-hopes-for-buddhist-tourism-boost|agency=Dawn News|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150120133732/http://www.dawn.com/news/796713/pakistan-hopes-for-buddhist-tourism-boost|archivedate=20 January 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n=== Takht-i-Bahi ===\n[[File:Takht-bhai-3.jpg|thumbnail|[[Takht-i-Bahi]]]]\nTakht means \u201cthrone\u201d and bahi, \u201cwater\u201d or \u201cspring\u201d in Persian/Urdu.

Buddhism can be traced back to before the formation of the Tibetan Empire. The region has a number of surviving Buddhist archaeological sites. These include the [[Manthal Buddha Rock]], a rock relief of the [[Buddha]] at the edge of the village (near Skardu) and the [[Sacred Rock of Hunza]]. Nearby are former sites of Buddhist shelters.\n\nBaltistan had Buddhist majority till the 15th century, before the arrival of Islam in this region.

It was also practiced in the [[Sindh]] regions.\n\n==== Sindh ====\nBuddhist sites in Sindh are numerous but ill preserved and various stages of deterioration.
