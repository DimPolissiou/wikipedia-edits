The team took the distance of 3 points on round 26, after the match against [[Associazione Calcio Liguria|Liguria]]. Following the result of Inter, Juventus lost its game against [[Trieste]] and not won the game of Liguria.

The second part of the season is opened with a massive score against [[Societ\u00e0 Sportiva Dilettantistica Lucchese 1905|Lucchese]]; on round 22 Juventus grabbed the club, then Inter retake the advantage by 2 points next sunday. The team took the distance of 3 points on round 26, after the match against [[Associazione Calcio Liguria|Liguria]]. Following the result of Inter, Juventus lost its game against [[Trieste]] and not won the game of Liguria. So, Ambrosiana remained over top in the last round with 39 points, followed by Juventus with 38 and Bologna. The squad clinched the title on final round, winning the match of [[Bari]]. \n\nWhen Ambrosiana beat Bari, Meazza scored five goals in a 9\u20132 victory. The next week he scored a hat-trick against Lucchese. Along with fellow Inter players Ferraris II, Ferrari, and Locatelli, Meazza was involved in the Azzurri set-up that wins the 1938 World Cup in Paris. Castellazzi with 33 years old became the youngest manager winning the scudetto, a record remained nowadays.\n\nA good performance of the club in Coppa Italia, only stopped by Juventus (0-2) in semifinals, champion of the trophy.

The song was released on August 29, 2019 ahead of the band's upcoming sixth album, but was confirmed by [[Tom DeLonge]] to not be the album's second single. The song was written by DeLonge, [[Ilan Rubin]], and Aaron Rubin.\n\n== Background ==\nMany months before its release, small portions of \"Kiss & Tell\" were originally used as promotional music for the band to tease the release of their previous single, [[Rebel Girl (Angels & Airwaves song)|Rebel Girl]], and the announcement of their 2019 North American Tour on their social media profiles. While it hadn't been confirmed as a song from the album yet, DeLonge briefly discussed the song in an interview with [[Rolling Stone]], feeling that it could have \"lived on the [[I-Empire|I''-Empire'']] and ''[[We Don't Need to Whisper|We Don\u2019t Need to Whisper]]'' records.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/tom-delonge-interview-ufo-footage-angels-airwaves-blink-182-843812/|title=Tom DeLonge on 'Scary' UFO Footage, Angels and Airwaves and Blink-182's Future|last=Doyle|first=Patrick|last2=Doyle|first2=Patrick|date=2019-06-04|website=Rolling Stone|language=en-US|access-date=2019-08-30}}</ref> The song's lyrics address doing something dangerous or something a person knows they shouldn't be doing, all while feeling nothing but excitement from their actions. DeLonge specifically cites [[The Beach Boys]] as his main influence, stating he \"wanted to create a sound that had electronic elements right alongside classic rock and pop punk melodic structures.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.altpress.com/news/angels-and-airwaves-kiss-and-tell/|title=Angels & Airwaves drop \"Kiss And Tell\" one day early|last=Shoemaker|first=Whitney|date=2019-08-29|website=Alternative Press|language=en-US|access-date=2019-08-30}}</ref>\n\n== Release and reception ==\nAngels & Airwaves announced the release of the song on their [[Instagram]] profile on August 27, 2019, with a promised release date three days later.

The song was released on August 29, 2019 ahead of the band's upcoming sixth album, but was confirmed by [[Tom DeLonge]] to not be the album's second single. The song was written by DeLonge, [[Ilan Rubin]], and Aaron Rubin.\n\n== Background ==\nMany months before its release, small portions of \"Kiss & Tell\" were originally used as promotional music for the band to tease the release of their previous single, [[Rebel Girl (Angels & Airwaves song)|Rebel Girl]], and the announcement of their 2019 North American Tour on their social media profiles. While it hadn't been confirmed as a song from the album yet, DeLonge briefly discussed the song in an interview with [[Rolling Stone]], feeling that it could have \"lived on the [[I-Empire|I''-Empire'']] and ''[[We Don't Need to Whisper|We Don\u2019t Need to Whisper]]'' records.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-features/tom-delonge-interview-ufo-footage-angels-airwaves-blink-182-843812/|title=Tom DeLonge on 'Scary' UFO Footage, Angels and Airwaves and Blink-182's Future|last=Doyle|first=Patrick|last2=Doyle|first2=Patrick|date=2019-06-04|website=Rolling Stone|language=en-US|access-date=2019-08-30}}</ref> The song's lyrics address doing something dangerous or something a person knows they shouldn't be doing, all while feeling nothing but excitement from their actions. DeLonge specifically cites [[The Beach Boys]] as his main influence, stating he \"wanted to create a sound that had electronic elements right alongside classic rock and pop punk melodic structures.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.altpress.com/news/angels-and-airwaves-kiss-and-tell/|title=Angels & Airwaves drop \"Kiss And Tell\" one day early|last=Shoemaker|first=Whitney|date=2019-08-29|website=Alternative Press|language=en-US|access-date=2019-08-30}}</ref>\n\n== Release and reception ==\nAngels & Airwaves announced the release of the song on their [[Instagram]] profile on August 27, 2019, with a promised release date three days later.
