Courses for a given language may be aimed at a specific audience: for instance, English may be learned as \"[[Public relations|PR]] English\" or \"Marketing English.\"\n\nIn August 2017, Babbel announced that it had partnered with [[Cambridge English Language Assessment]] to create a low-cost online English test.<ref>https://thepienews.com/news/cambridge-english-babbel-lowcost-test/</ref><ref>https://techcrunch.com/2017/08/15/babbel-teams-up-with-cambridge-english-to-launch-new-language-test/</ref> The  test assesses beginning and intermediate students' reading and listening skills (up to level B1 and above of the [[Common European Framework of Reference for Languages]]).

It is also a pun on the biblical [[Tower of Babel]]\u2014a gigantic [[ziggurat]] whose construction was interrupted when the worker' languages were made mutually unintelligible by God. The same motif was used in naming the Babel fish from Douglas Adams's ''Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy'', a symbiotic fish that serves as a universal translator. Babbel is also a [[homophone]] of the English verb \"[[wiktionary:babble|babble]].\"\n\n=== Campaigns ===\nBabbel's content marketing arm publishes a [[Online magazine|digital magazine]] with written and video content in seven different languages. The topics range from behind-the-scenes looks at how Babbel lessons are created to profiles of Babbel customers and language learning tips from the company's didactics team.

In two studies, Urbaniak and Kilmann found that women claimed to prefer \"Nice Todd\" over \"Neutral Todd\" and \"Jerk Todd\", relative to \"Michael\" even at differing levels of [[physical attractiveness]].

The \"nice guys finish last\" phrase is also said to be coined by American biologist [[Garrett Hardin]] to sum up the [[selfish gene theory]] of life and evolution. This was disputed by [[Richard Dawkins]], who wrote the book ''[[The Selfish Gene]]''. Dawkins was misinterpreted by many as confirming the \"nice guy finishing last\" view, but refuted the claims in the [[BBC]] documentary ''[[Nice Guys Finish First]]''.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nThe \"nice guys finish last\" view is that there is a discrepancy between women's stated preferences and their actual choices in men. In other words, women say that they want nice guys, but really go for men who are \"jerks\" or \"[[bad boy (archetype)|bad boys]]\" in the end. Stephan Desrochers claims, in a 1995 article in the journal ''Sex Roles'', that many \"sensitive\" men, based on personal experience, do not believe women actually want \"nice guys\".<ref name=\"Desrochers\">{{cite journal |last=Desrochers |first=Stephan |year=1995 |title=What types of men are most attractive and most repulsive to women |journal=Sex Roles |volume=32 |issue=5\u20136 |pages=375\u2013391 |doi=10.1007/BF01544603 }}</ref>\n\nAccording to McDaniel, popular culture and dating advice: \"...suggest that women claim they want a 'nice guy' because they believe that is what is expected of them when, in reality, they want the so-called 'challenge' that comes with dating a not-so-nice guy.\"<ref name=\"McDaniel\"/>\n\nUrbaniak & Kilmann write that:\n{{quote|\"Although women often portray themselves as wanting to date kind, sensitive, and emotionally expressive men, the nice guy stereotype contends that, when actually presented with a choice between such a 'nice guy' and an unkind, insensitive, emotionally-closed, 'macho man' or 'jerk,' they invariably reject the nice guy in favor of his 'so-called' macho competitor.\"<ref name=\"Urbaniak03\"/>}}\n\nAnother perspective is that women do want \"nice guys,\" at least when they are looking for a romantic relationship. Desrochers (1995) suggests that \"it still seems popular to believe that women in contemporary America prefer men who are 'sensitive,' or have feminine personality traits.\" Women have differing opinions about whether \"nice guys finish last\" sexually or not.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nHerold and [[Robin Milhausen|Milhausen]]<ref name=\"Herold99\">{{cite journal |last1= Herold |first1=Edward S. |last2= Milhausen |first2= Robin R. |year=1999 |title=Dating preferences of university women: an analysis of the nice guy stereotype. |journal= Journal of Sex & Marital Therapy|volume= 25|issue=4 |pages=333\u2013343 |doi= 10.1080/00926239908404010|pmid=10546171 | issn=0092-623X}}</ref> found that 56% of 165 university women claimed to agree with the statement: \"You may have heard the expression, 'Nice guys finish last.'

From said courting, the 'nice guy' may hope to form a romantic relationship or may be motivated by a simple desire to increase his sexual activity. The results of failure are often resentment toward women and/or society. The 'nice guy' is commonly said to be put by women \"into the [[friend zone]]\" who do not reciprocate his romantic or sexual interest. Third wave feminist interpretations tend to see this resentment as being based upon an assumption by men that they are entitled to sex and are therefore confused when they find that it is not forthcoming despite their supposed 'niceness'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.feministcritics.org/blog/2010/01/04/do-nice-guys-finish-last-rp/Do|title=Do 27% of Europeans say rape may be acceptable in some circumstances?|date=30 November 2016|accessdate=2018-03-11}}</ref> More male orientated interpretations claim that the resentment is down to the fact that society, and the vast majority of people in spoken conversation, claim to be attracted to traits such as honesty, integrity and kindness, when in reality more superficial considerations trigger attraction. According to this interpretation people who display wealth, good looks, dominance and confidence tend to succeed more in romance than do 'nice guys'.

The \"nice guys finish last\" phrase is also said to be coined by American biologist [[Garrett Hardin]] to sum up the [[selfish gene theory]] of life and evolution. This was disputed by [[Richard Dawkins]], who wrote the book ''[[The Selfish Gene]]''. Dawkins was misinterpreted by many as confirming the \"nice guy finishing last\" view, but refuted the claims in the [[BBC]] documentary ''[[Nice Guys Finish First]]''.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nThe \"nice guys finish last\" view is that there is a discrepancy between women's stated preferences and their actual choices in men. In other words, women say that they want nice guys, but really go for men who are \"jerks\" or \"[[bad boy (archetype)|bad boys]]\" in the end. Stephan Desrochers claims, in a 1995 article in the journal ''Sex Roles'', that many \"sensitive\" men, based on personal experience, do not believe women actually want \"nice guys\".<ref name=\"Desrochers\">{{cite journal |last=Desrochers |first=Stephan |year=1995 |title=What types of men are most attractive and most repulsive to women |journal=Sex Roles |volume=32 |issue=5\u20136 |pages=375\u2013391 |doi=10.1007/BF01544603 }}</ref>\n\nAccording to McDaniel, popular culture and dating advice: \"...suggest that women claim they want a 'nice guy' because they believe that is what is expected of them when, in reality, they want the so-called 'challenge' that comes with dating a not-so-nice guy.\"<ref name=\"McDaniel\"/>\n\nUrbaniak & Kilmann write that:\n{{quote|\"Although women often portray themselves as wanting to date kind, sensitive, and emotionally expressive men, the nice guy stereotype contends that, when actually presented with a choice between such a 'nice guy' and an unkind, insensitive, emotionally-closed, 'macho man' or 'jerk,' they invariably reject the nice guy in favor of his 'so-called' macho competitor.\"<ref name=\"Urbaniak03\"/>}}\n\nAnother perspective is that women do want \"nice guys,\" at least when they are looking for a romantic relationship. Desrochers (1995) suggests that \"it still seems popular to believe that women in contemporary America prefer men who are 'sensitive,' or have feminine personality traits.\" Women have differing opinions about whether \"nice guys finish last\" sexually or not.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}\n\nHerold and [[Robin Milhausen|Milhausen]]<ref name=\"Herold99\">{{cite journal |last1= Herold |first1=Edward S. |last2= Milhausen |first2= Robin R. |year=1999 |title=Dating preferences of university women: an analysis of the nice guy stereotype. |journal= Journal of Sex & Marital Therapy|volume= 25|issue=4 |pages=333\u2013343 |doi= 10.1080/00926239908404010|pmid=10546171 | issn=0092-623X}}</ref> found that 56% of 165 university women claimed to agree with the statement: \"You may have heard the expression, 'Nice guys finish last.' In terms of dating, and sex, do you think women are less likely to have sex with men who are 'nice' than men who are 'not nice'?\" A third view is that while \"nice guys\" may not be as successful at attracting women sexually, they may be sought after by women looking for long-term romantic relationships (however, \"nice guys need not lose all hope, with studies showing that while women like 'bad boys' for flings, they tend to settle down with more caring types\" \u2013 the \"bad boys\" tending to exhibit the [[dark triad]], i.e., \"the self-obsession of [[narcissism]], the impulsive, thrill-seeking and callous behaviour of the psychopath and the deceitful and exploitative nature of Machiavellianism\". It is a possibility that women leave to escape their circumstances of abuse, disease or pregnancy to seek a chance with the nice guy (they rejected previously), afterwards.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}\n\nHerold and Milhausen claim: \"While 'nice guys' may not be competitive in terms of numbers of sexual partners, they tend to be more successful with respect to longer-term, committed relationships.\"<ref name=\"Herold99\"/>\n\nAnother study indicates that \"for brief affairs, women tend to prefer a dominating, powerful and promiscuous man.\" Further evidence appears in a 2005 study in Prague: \"Since women can always get a man for a one-night stand, they gain an advantage if they find partners for child-rearing.\"<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2005/08/07/INGJ9E31DH1.DTL |work=The San Francisco Chronicle |title=Why women cheat / Birds stray the nest and so do many of our human females |first=Matt |last=Reynolds |date=7 August 2005}}</ref>\n\n===\"Nice Guy\" syndrome===\nThe terms \"Nice Guy\" and \"nice guy syndrome\" can be used to describe a man who views himself as a prototypical \"nice guy,\" but whose \"nice deeds\" are deemed to be solely motivated by a desire to court women. From said courting, the 'nice guy' may hope to form a romantic relationship or may be motivated by a simple desire to increase his sexual activity. The results of failure are often resentment toward women and/or society. The 'nice guy' is commonly said to be put by women \"into the [[friend zone]]\" who do not reciprocate his romantic or sexual interest. Third wave feminist interpretations tend to see this resentment as being based upon an assumption by men that they are entitled to sex and are therefore confused when they find that it is not forthcoming despite their supposed 'niceness'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.feministcritics.org/blog/2010/01/04/do-nice-guys-finish-last-rp/Do|title=Do 27% of Europeans say rape may be acceptable in some circumstances?|date=30 November 2016|accessdate=2018-03-11}}</ref> More male orientated interpretations claim that the resentment is down to the fact that society, and the vast majority of people in spoken conversation, claim to be attracted to traits such as honesty, integrity and kindness, when in reality more superficial considerations trigger attraction. According to this interpretation people who display wealth, good looks, dominance and confidence tend to succeed more in romance than do 'nice guys'. Nice guys are therefore resentful at the inconsistency between what people claim to be attracted to and by how they act in reality.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.feministe.us/blog/archives/2011/09/20/what-romantic-comedies-can-teach-us-about-ourselves/|title=What romantic comedies can teach us about ourselves \u2013 Feministe|website=www.feministe.us|accessdate=2018-03-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://community.feministing.com/2011/11/13/regarding-nice-guys-and-why-women-only-date-jerks-a-critique-of-a-masculine-victim-cult/|title=Regarding 'Nice Guys' and 'Why Women Only Date Jerks'- A Critique of a Masculine Victim-Cult|accessdate=2018-03-11}}</ref>\n\nIn early 2002, the web site [[Heartless Bitches International]] (HBI)<ref>{{cite book |last=Whittaker |first=Jason |title=The cyberspace handbook |publisher=Routledge |year=2004 |pages=186\u2013187 |isbn=978-0-415-16835-9 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ulp37hq8FKIC&pg=RA1-PA187 |accessdate=2009-11-21}}</ref> published several \"rants\" on the concept of the Nice Guy. The central theme was that a genuinely nice male is desirable, but that many Nice Guys are insecure men unwilling to articulate their romantic or sexual feelings directly. Instead, they choose to present themselves as their paramour's friend, and hang around, doing nice things for her in hopes that she will pick up on their desire for her. If she fails to read their secret feelings, Nice Guys become embittered and blame her for taking advantage of them and their niceness.
