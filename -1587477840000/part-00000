It is also significant because Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h left his [[Bah\u00e1\u02bc\u00ed pilgrimage#House of Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h, Baghdad|house in Baghdad]], which he designated the \"Most Great House\", to enter the Garden of Ridv\u00e1n. Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h compares this move from the Most Great House to the Garden of Ridv\u00e1n to [[Muhammad]]'s [[Hijra (Islam)|travel from]] [[Mecca]] to [[Medina]].\n\nFurthermore, during Bah\u00e1\u02bcu'll\u00e1h's first day in the garden, he made three further announcements: (1) abrogating [[religious war]], which was permitted under certain conditions in [[Islam]] and the B\u00e1b\u00ed faith; (2) that there would not be [[Bah\u00e1{{hamza}}\u00ed prophecies#The next Manifestation of God|another Manifestation of God]] for another 1,000 years; and (3) that all the [[Names of God#Bah\u00e1{{hamza}}\u00ed Faith|names of God]] were fully manifest in all things.<ref name=\"walbridge\" /> These statements appear in a text written some years after 1863, which has been included in the compilation ''[[Days of Remembrance]]'' (section 9).
