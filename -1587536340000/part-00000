Because of pollution and destruction of their natural habitat, along with segregation caused by caging, reproduction of wild pandas was severely limited. In the 1990s, however, several laws (including gun control and the removal of resident humans from the reserves) helped their chances of survival. With these renewed efforts and improved conservation methods, wild pandas have started to increase in numbers in some areas, though they still are classified as a [[rare species]].|date=March 2020}}\n\nIn 2006, scientists reported that the number of pandas living in the wild may have been underestimated at about 1,000. Previous population surveys had used conventional methods to estimate the size of the wild panda population, but using a new method that analyzes [[DNA]] from panda [[Feces|droppings]], scientists believe the wild population may be as large as 3,000.<ref name=\"Britannica Earth\"/> In 2006, there were 40 panda reserves in China, compared to just 13 reserves in 1998.<ref name=\"BBC_06-07\" /> As the species has been reclassified to \"vulnerable\" since 2016, the conservation efforts are thought to be working. Furthermore, in response to this reclassification, the [[State Forestry Administration of the People's Republic of China|State Forestry Administration of China]] announced that they would not accordingly lower the conservation level for panda, and would instead reinforce the conservation efforts.<ref>[http://www.forestry.gov.cn/main/195/content-902929.html The Panda is still endangered species, and the conservation efforts still need to be reinforced] ''State Forestry Administration of the People's Republic of China'' (in Chinese)</ref>\n\nThe giant panda is among the world's most adored and protected rare animals, and is one of the few in the world whose natural inhabitant status was able to gain a [[World Heritage Site|UNESCO World Heritage Site]] designation.

Because of pollution and destruction of their natural habitat, along with segregation caused by caging, reproduction of wild pandas was severely limited. In the 1990s, however, several laws (including gun control and the removal of resident humans from the reserves) helped their chances of survival. With these renewed efforts and improved conservation methods, wild pandas have started to increase in numbers in some areas, though they still are classified as a [[rare species]].|date=March 2020}}\n\nIn 2006, scientists reported that the number of pandas living in the wild may have been underestimated at about 1,000. Previous population surveys had used conventional methods to estimate the size of the wild panda population, but using a new method that analyzes [[DNA]] from panda [[Feces|droppings]], scientists believe the wild population may be as large as 3,000.<ref name=\"Britannica Earth\"/> In 2006, there were 40 panda reserves in China, compared to just 13 reserves in 1998.<ref name=\"BBC_06-07\" /> As the species has been reclassified to \"vulnerable\" since 2016, the conservation efforts are thought to be working.

The narrator relates two facts: (1) Noah became drunken and \"he was uncovered within his tent\", and (2) Ham \"saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brethren without\". Thus, these passages revolve around sexuality and the exposure of genitalia as compared with other Hebrew Bible texts, such as {{Bibleverse|Habakkuk|2:15|HE}} and {{Bibleverse|Lamentations|4:21|HE}}.<ref>Ellens & Rollins, 2004, p.53</ref>\n\nOther commentaries mention that seeing someone's nakedness could mean having sex with that person as quoted in {{Bibleverse|Leviticus|18:7-8|HE}} and {{Bibleverse|Leviticus|20:11|HE}}.

The [[Quran]] contains 43 references to Noah, or ''Nu\u1e25'', in 28 chapters, and the seventy-first chapter, [[Nuh (surah)|''S\u016brah N\u016b\u1e25'']] ({{lang-ar|\u0633\u0648\u0631\u0629 \u0646\u0648\u062d}}), is named after him. His life is also spoken of in the commentaries and in Islamic legends.\n\nNoah's narratives largely cover his preaching as well the story of the [[Flood myth|Deluge]]. Noah's narrative sets the prototype for many of the subsequent prophetic stories, which begin with the prophet warning his people and then the community rejecting the message and facing a punishment.\n\nNoah has several titles in Islam, based primarily on praise for him in the Quran, including \"True Messenger of God\" (XXVI: 107) and \"Grateful Servant of God\" (XVII: 3).<ref name=Skolnik287 >{{cite book|ref=harv|last1=Skolnik|first1=Fred|last2=Berenbaum|first2=Michael|title=Encyclopaedia Judaica|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JD0OAQAAMAAJ|year=2007|publisher=Macmillan Reference USA|isbn=978-0-02-865943-5|pages=287\u2013291}}</ref><ref name=\"Enc Islam\">{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Gibb|first=Hamilton Alexander Rosskeen|authorlink=Hamilton Alexander Rosskeen Gibb|title=The Encyclopaedia of Islam: NED-SAM|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OO4pAQAAMAAJ|year=1995|publisher=Brill|pages=108\u2013109}}</ref>\n\nThe Quran focuses on several instances from Noah's life more than others, and one of the most significant events is the Flood. God makes a [[covenant (biblical)|covenant]] with Noah just as he did with Abraham, [[Moses in Islam|Moses]], [[Jesus in Islam|Jesus]] and [[Muhammad in Islam|Muhammad]] later on (33:7). Noah is later reviled by his people and reproached by them for being a mere human messenger and not an angel (10:72\u201374). Moreover, the people mock Noah's words and call him a liar (7:62), and they even suggest that Noah is possessed by a devil when the prophet ceases to preach (54:9). Only the lowest in the community join Noah in believing in God's message (11:29), and Noah's narrative further describes him preaching both in private and public. Noah prays to God, \"Lord, leave not one single family of Infidels from the land: / For if thou leave them they will beguile thy servants and will beget only sinners, infidels.\"{{dead link|date=March 2017}}<ref>[https://http//www.quranbrowser.com/%20%22family 71:26\u201327 Rodwell 1876 version]{{dead link|date=March 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> The Quran narrates that Noah received a revelation to build an [[Noah's Ark|Ark]], after his people refused to believe in his message and hear the warning. The narrative goes on to describe that waters poured forth from the Heavens, destroying all the sinners. Even one of his sons disbelieved him, stayed behind, and was drowned. After the Flood ended, the Ark rested atop [[Mount Judi]] ({{cite quran|11|44|s=ns}}).\n[[File:Noah's ark and the deluge.JPG|thumb|Noah's ark and the deluge from Zubdat-al Tawarikh]]\nAlso, Islamic beliefs deny the idea of Noah being the first person to drink wine and experience the aftereffects of doing so.<ref name=Skolnik287 /><ref name = \"Enc Islam\"/>\n\n{{cite quran|29|14|s=ns}} states that Noah had been living among the people who he was sent to for 950 years when the flood started.\n{{quote|And, indeed, [in times long past] We sent forth Noah unto his people, and he dwelt among them a thousand years bar fifty; and then the floods overwhelmed them while they were still lost in evildoing.}}\n\nAccording to the [[Ahmadiyya]] understanding of the Quran, the period described in the Quran is the age of his [[Dispensation (period)|dispensation]], which extended until the time of [[Abraham in Islam|Ibrahim]] (Abraham, 950 years).

Noah was the subject of much elaboration in the literature of later Abrahamic religions, including the [[Quran]] ([[Surah]]s [[Sura 71|71]], [[Sura 7|7]], [[Sura 11|1]], and [[Sura 21|21]]).\n\n==Biblical account==\n[[File:Noah mosaic.JPG|thumb|right |12th-century Venetian [[mosaic]] depiction of Noah sending the dove]]\nThe primary account of Noah in the Bible is in the [[Book of Genesis]].\n\nNoah was the tenth of the Pre-Flood ([[Antediluvian]]) Patriarchs.

Harold Ellens|J. H. Ellens]] and W. G. Rollins address the narrative of {{Bibleverse||Genesis|9:18\u201327|HE}} that narrates the unconventional behavior that occurs between Noah and Ham. Because of its brevity and textual inconsistencies, it has been suggested that this narrative is a \"splinter from a more substantial tale\".<ref>Speiser, 1964, 62</ref><ref>T. A. Bergren. ''Biblical Figures Outside the Bible'', 2002, ({{ISBN|1563384116}}, {{ISBN|978-1-56338-411-0}}), p. 136</ref> A fuller account would explain what exactly Ham had done to his father, or why Noah directed a curse at [[Canaan (son of Ham)|Canaan]] for Ham's misdeed, or how Noah came to know what occurred. The narrator relates two facts: (1) Noah became drunken and \"he was uncovered within his tent\", and (2) Ham \"saw the nakedness of his father, and told his two brethren without\". Thus, these passages revolve around sexuality and the exposure of genitalia as compared with other Hebrew Bible texts, such as {{Bibleverse|Habakkuk|2:15|HE}} and {{Bibleverse|Lamentations|4:21|HE}}.<ref>Ellens & Rollins, 2004, p.53</ref>\n\nOther commentaries mention that seeing someone's nakedness could mean having sex with that person as quoted in {{Bibleverse|Leviticus|18:7-8|HE}} and {{Bibleverse|Leviticus|20:11|HE}}. From this interpretation, it can be deduced that Ham was guilty of engaging in incest and raping Noah.<ref>Levenson, 2004, 26</ref>\n\n===Table of nations===\n[[File:Noahsworld map.jpg|thumb|right|The dispersion of the descendants of Shem, Ham, and Japheth (map from the 1854 ''Historical Textbook and Atlas of Biblical Geography'')]]\n{{See also|Generations of Noah}}\n{{Bibleverse||Genesis|10|HE}} sets forth the descendants of Shem, Ham, and Japheth, from whom the nations branched out over the earth after the flood. Among Japheth\u2019s descendants were the maritime nations. (10:2\u20135) Ham\u2019s son [[Biblical Cush|Cush]] had a son named [[Nimrod]], who became the first man of might on earth, a mighty hunter, king in [[Babylon]] and the land of [[Shinar]].

(10:15\u201319) Among Shem\u2019s descendants was [[Eber]]. (10:21)\n\nThese genealogies differ structurally from those set out in Genesis 5 and 11. It has a segmented or treelike structure, going from one father to many offspring. It is strange that the table, which assumes that the population is distributed about the Earth, precedes the account of the [[Tower of Babel]], which says that all the population is in one place before it is dispersed.<ref>{{citation |last=Bandstra |first=B. |url=https://books.google.com/?id=vRY9mTUZKJcC&pg=PA67#v=onepage&q=%22table%20of%20nations%22%20noah&f=false |title=Reading the Old Testament: Introduction to the Hebrew Bible |publisher= Cengage Learning |year=2008 |pages= 67\u201368|isbn=978-0495391050 }}</ref>\n\n==Family tree==\n{{AdamtoNoah}}\n\n==Narrative analysis==\nAccording to the [[documentary hypothesis]], the first five books of the Bible ([[Pentateuch]]/[[Torah]]), including Genesis, were collated during the 5th century BC from four main sources, which themselves date from no earlier than the 10th century BC.

The few variations include the number of days of the deluge, the order of the birds, and the name of the mountain on which the ark rests.

The [[Quran]] contains 43 references to Noah, or ''Nu\u1e25'', in 28 chapters, and the seventy-first chapter, [[Nuh (surah)|''S\u016brah N\u016b\u1e25'']] ({{lang-ar|\u0633\u0648\u0631\u0629 \u0646\u0648\u062d}}), is named after him. His life is also spoken of in the commentaries and in Islamic legends.\n\nNoah's narratives largely cover his preaching as well the story of the [[Flood myth|Deluge]]. Noah's narrative sets the prototype for many of the subsequent prophetic stories, which begin with the prophet warning his people and then the community rejecting the message and facing a punishment.\n\nNoah has several titles in Islam, based primarily on praise for him in the Quran, including \"True Messenger of God\" (XXVI: 107) and \"Grateful Servant of God\" (XVII: 3).<ref name=Skolnik287 >{{cite book|ref=harv|last1=Skolnik|first1=Fred|last2=Berenbaum|first2=Michael|title=Encyclopaedia Judaica|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JD0OAQAAMAAJ|year=2007|publisher=Macmillan Reference USA|isbn=978-0-02-865943-5|pages=287\u2013291}}</ref><ref name=\"Enc Islam\">{{cite book|ref=harv|last=Gibb|first=Hamilton Alexander Rosskeen|authorlink=Hamilton Alexander Rosskeen Gibb|title=The Encyclopaedia of Islam: NED-SAM|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OO4pAQAAMAAJ|year=1995|publisher=Brill|pages=108\u2013109}}</ref>\n\nThe Quran focuses on several instances from Noah's life more than others, and one of the most significant events is the Flood.

Noah is later reviled by his people and reproached by them for being a mere human messenger and not an angel (10:72\u201374). Moreover, the people mock Noah's words and call him a liar (7:62), and they even suggest that Noah is possessed by a devil when the prophet ceases to preach (54:9). Only the lowest in the community join Noah in believing in God's message (11:29), and Noah's narrative further describes him preaching both in private and public.

During the game there was a scuffle involving Tennessee's Semeka Randall and Connecticut's Svetlana Abrosimova where Randall threw the ball down, hitting Abrosimova's head.

The Huskies advanced to their first Final Four since 1996 and beat Penn State in the semifinals, reaching the Lady Vols for the championship game in Auriemma's hometown of Philadelphia. Despite the two regular season meetings being close battles, UConn used tenacious defense and backdoor cuts to overwhelm Tennessee 71\u201352 for their second national championship.

Additionally, junior guard Caroline Doty would be out the entire season due to a third knee injury.  In an early test, UConn squeaked by #2 Baylor in their second game of the season. They powered their way through 8 more consecutive wins for their 88th straight victory, beating #10 Ohio State at Madison Square Garden. Their 89th win came at home against #20 Florida State to set the college basketball record for most consecutive wins, previously held by the UCLA men's team.

UConn trailed for the entire game and lost for the first time since their April 6, 2008 Final Four appearance (also against the Cardinal). The loss ended the highly publicized [[Basketball winning streaks|winning streak]], as well as their long held spot as the top ranked team in women's basketball which was taken over by Baylor. Connecticut recovered focus after the loss and got through the rest of the regular season undefeated, regaining the #1 ranking along the way after Baylor's loss to Texas Tech in February. They marched through the Big East tournament, including their 3rd victory of the year over Notre Dame in the Big East Tournament Championship Game.\n\nIn the NCAA tournament Final Four UConn met Notre Dame for the fourth time of the season, with the underdog Fighting Irish prevailing and ending UConn's bid for a third straight national championship. The keys to Notre Dame's success were the stellar performance of sophomore [[Skylar Diggins]] and the hot shooting (over 50 percent from the field, a first against UConn in its last 262 games), while UConn had a lack of support for Moore's 36 points.<ref>{{cite web|title=Irish shock UConn in semis|url=https://www.ncaa.com/news/basketball-women/article/2011-04-04/irish-shock-uconn-semis|publisher=NCAA.com|accessdate=13 April 2016}}</ref> Notre Dame went on to the National Championship Game, but were defeated by the Texas A&M Aggies.\n\nDuring 2010\u201311 season Maya Moore posted career highs in scoring (22.3 ppg), assists (4.1 apg) and steals (2.2 spg), sweeping all possible individual honors: she won her 2nd [[Naismith College Player of the Year]] award, her 3rd straight [[Wade Trophy]] (only player in history - freshmen are not eligible for this award), her 2nd [[Associated Press Women's College Basketball Player of the Year]] award, her 2nd [[USBWA Women's National Player of the Year]] award and her 2nd [[John R.

On February 28 she was enshrined in the [[Huskies of Honor]] (3rd time ever for an active player).\n\nMaya Moore was also a brilliant college student: she graduated with a 3.7 GPA, earning the [[Elite 88 Award]], and was named Cosida Academic All-America First-Team in 2009, 2010 and 2011, [[List of Women's Basketball Academic All-America Team Members of the Year|Cosida Academic All-America of the Year]] in 2010 and 2011 (1st player to ever repeat) and [[List of Academic All-America Team Members of the Year|All-sports Academic All-America of the Year]] in 2011.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Voepel|first1=Mechelle|title=UConn's Moore leaves incredible legacy|url=http://espn.go.com/ncw/tournament/2011/columns/story?id=6288546&columnist=voepel_mechelle|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=10 April 2016}}</ref>\n\nAfter graduation Maya Moore was selected by the [[Minnesota Lynx]] as the 1st overall pick in the 2011 WNBA draft (4th time for a Husky), also becoming the first female basketball player signed to the Jordan Brand.<ref>{{cite web|title=Maya Moore Becomes First Women's Basketball Player Signed To Jordan Brand|url=https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2011/5/18/2177846/maya-moore-jordan-brand-first-female-basketball-player|publisher=SBNation|accessdate=31 March 2016}}</ref>\n\n===The eye of the storm (2012)===\nThe 2011\u201312 season would inevitably be a new era after Maya Moore's graduation. Her absence and the loss of 6th-man Lorin Dixon left significant holes to fill in the roster. Geno Auriemma seemed to find the right pieces with a freshman class that included [[Kaleena Mosqueda-Lewis]], Brianna Banks and Kiah Stokes. Mosqueda-Lewis was another State Farm/WBCA High School Player of the Year for UConn,<ref name=KML>{{cite web|title=Kaleena Mosqueda-Lewis|url=http://espn.go.com/high-school/girls-basketball/recruiting/player/_/id/66471|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=26 November 2011}}</ref> Banks was a highly rated guard,<ref name=Banks>{{cite web|title=Brianna Banks|url=http://espn.go.com/high-school/girls-basketball/recruiting/player/_/id/73104|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=26 November 2011}}</ref> and Stokes, a 6'3 post player, was highly ranked as well. Other key players included sophomores [[Stefanie Dolson]] and [[Bria Hartley]], junior [[Kelly Faris]] and senior [[Tiffany Hayes]], who would be all selected in the WNBA drafts after graduation.\n\nEven if the Huskies were still a strong national contender, they were no longer viewed as a favorite to win it all. Two key rivals were the usual conference foe Notre Dame and the new rival Baylor, who had the nation's top player in [[Brittney Griner]]. In December Griner led #1 ranked Baylor against #2 UConn, scoring 25 points to go along with nine blocks. The 66\u201361 loss was UConn's first of the season, but not its last. Notre Dame, led by junior star [[Skylar Diggins-Smith|Skylar Diggins]], beat the Huskies twice in the regular season, but UConn was able to reverse the roles in the Big East Tournament Championship Game; the win was the school's 15th conference title, as well as the 800th career win for coach Geno Auriemma. Ultimately Notre Dame found its revenge with an upset win in the NCAA Tournament Final Four, ending the season with a 3\u20131 record against the Huskies, a record that would be repeated the following year.\n\n===Breanna Stewart era (2013\u20132016)===\n====2013 national championship====\n{{See also|2012\u201313 Connecticut Huskies women's basketball team}}\n[[File:2013 UConn Women's Basketball team at the White House.JPG|thumb|450 px|The 2013 UConn Women's Basketball team is greeted by President Obama at the White House]]\nThe 2012\u201313 season began with high hopes having UConn landed three highly ranked recruits: #1 overall [[Breanna Stewart]] from [[Cicero \u2013 North Syracuse High School]], forward [[Morgan Tuck]] and guard [[Moriah Jefferson]]. Their play was uneven during the regular season, where UConn went 27\u20133 with a loss to Baylor and a pair of losses to Notre Dame (including a three-overtime game in South Bend); in the Big East tournament UConn lost a third straight time to Notre Dame that delivered a last-minute comeback. In the NCAA tournament UConn key-players Stewart, [[Kaleena Mosqueda-Lewis]], [[Stefanie Dolson]] and senior [[Kelly Faris]] raised their level of play, and UConn easily advanced to the Final Four; in the semifinals they handily beat Notre Dame and in the finals they obtained a 93\u201360 win over Louisville, who had earlier upset Baylor, for a record tying eighth national championship.\n\nThe end of 2012\u201313 season saw the [[2010\u201313 Big East Conference realignment|breakup of the Big East Conference]]. First Pittsburgh, Syracuse and Notre Dame defected to the [[Atlantic Coast Conference]], with Louisville announcing later they would follow in 2014.  Then, the non-FBS football playing members of the Big East (Georgetown, Villanova, Providence, DePaul, Marquette, Seton Hall, St. John's), known colloquially as the \"[[2010\u201313 Big East Conference realignment#Catholic 7|Catholic 7]]\", left to form their own conference, taking the conference name with them.

UConn defeated 79\u201358 Notre Dame (hindered by the loss of one of their stars, [[Natalie Achonwa]], who had [[Anterior cruciate ligament injury|torn her ACL]] in the Elite Eight), to finish the season 40\u20130, tying Baylor for the most wins in a season and setting the new record for Championship with nine.<ref>{{cite web|title=Breanna Stewart, Stefanie Dolson lead UConn to record 9th title|url=http://espn.go.com/womens-college-basketball/recap?gameId=400551354|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=13 April 2016}}</ref> Breanna Stewart was named the AP Player of the year, only the third time in history a sophomore has won the honor.\n\n====2015 national championship====\n{{See also|2014\u201315 UConn Huskies women's basketball team}}\nThe 2014\u201315 regular season started with an overtime loss to Stanford in the second game of the season, ending a 47-games winning streak for UConn.

In the National Tournament, both Connecticut and Notre Dame were seeded first in their respective playoff brackets; each advanced to the Final Four held in Tampa, Florida. Connecticut defeated Maryland 81\u201358, while Notre Dame narrowly beat South Carolina, 66\u201365, in the semifinals.\n\nThe teams met again on April 7, 2015 in the national championship game.

At the time of her injury, she was only one point shy of Kerry Bascom's school scoring record. The next game, with Bascom's blessing, and assistance from friend and Villanova head coach [[Harry Perretta]], Auriemma arranged to have Sales, who was on crutches, score a basket and then allow Villanova to score a basket to start the game at 2\u20132.

Auriemma felt guilty that he put Sales through the ordeal and was angry that some columnists chose to fault her and not him.

High school All-Americans [[Swin Cash]], [[Tamika Williams]], [[Sue Bird]], [[Asjha Jones]], and Keirsten Walters were dubbed \"TASSK Force\" by Connecticut fans, using the players' initials. The class renewed hope of bringing more championships to Storrs after watching archrival Tennessee win three in a row.\n\nThe first season for the highly ranked class in 1998\u201399 was up and down and featured many injuries: Sue Bird tore her ACL and was lost for the season after only 10 games.\n\nIn the 1999 meeting at Gampel Pavilion, Tennessee prevailed again. During the game there was a scuffle involving Tennessee's Semeka Randall and Connecticut's Svetlana Abrosimova where Randall threw the ball down, hitting Abrosimova's head. UConn fans booed Randall the rest of the game and Tennessee fans later gave her the nickname \"Boo.\"<ref>{{cite web|title=Heckling Randall Aboo-boo|url=http://articles.courant.com/2000-02-02/sports/0002020122_1_uconn-fans-uconn-coach-geno-auriemma-penny-hardaway|publisher=Hartford Courant|accessdate=12 April 2016}}</ref> The 1998\u201399 season ended in the Sweet Sixteen round of the NCAA Tournament, where UConn lost 64\u201358 to Iowa State, falling short of reaching the Final Four for the third consecutive time.\n\n====2000 national championship====\n{{See also|1999\u20132000 Connecticut Huskies women's basketball team}}\nMotivated by the previous disappointing season, UConn came back in 1999\u20132000 with the clear goal of reaching the championship level again. Led by upperclassmen Shea Ralph, Kelly Schumacher, Svetlana Abrosimova and the TASS Force (the K was dropped when Keirsten Walters had to give up basketball due to knee problems), UConn went through the regular season with a 27\u20131 record, their only loss being a single-point defeat to Tennessee at home\u2014UConn had beaten Tennessee earlier in the season in Knoxville, and this was the first year the teams met twice. The Huskies advanced to their first Final Four since 1996 and beat Penn State in the semifinals, reaching the Lady Vols for the championship game in Auriemma's hometown of Philadelphia. Despite the two regular season meetings being close battles, UConn used tenacious defense and backdoor cuts to overwhelm Tennessee 71\u201352 for their second national championship. Connecticut's final season record was 36\u20131 and Shea Ralph was named the Final Four's [[NCAA Basketball Tournament Most Outstanding Player|MVP]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Simply the Best!|url=http://advance.uconn.edu/2000/000404/00040401.htm|publisher=UConn Advance|accessdate=12 April 2016}}</ref>\n\n===Diana Taurasi era (2001\u20132004)===\n[[File:Diana Taurasi Naismith Award 2004.jpg|thumb|Diana Taurasi Naismith Award]]\nAuriemma pulled off another huge recruiting coup when he convinced All-American guard [[Diana Taurasi]] to travel across country to attend Connecticut.

The only close game the Huskies played all year long was a win at Virginia Tech.\n\nUConn advanced to the Final Four and outscored rival Tennessee in the semifinals by 23 points. In front of a record-breaking crowd at the Alamodome in San Antonio, UConn defeated Oklahoma for the championship 82\u201370 to complete a perfect 39\u20130 season.

The win was even more special as the UConn men's basketball team won the men's national championship the previous night, marking the first time one University won both the men's and women's basketball championships in one season, a feat UConn repeated in 2014.\n\nIn her career at UConn, Taurasi led the team to four consecutive Final Fours and three straight national titles.

In the Championship Game UConn defeated Louisville 76\u201354 behind Charles' 25 points and 19 boards, ending the season with a perfect 39\u20130 record (with every victory by at least 10 points, a record of its own) and sixth national title.<ref>{{cite web|author=|url=http://espn.go.com/ncw/recap?gameId=294000063 |title=Louisville Cardinals vs. Connecticut Huskies - Recap - April 07, 2009 - ESPN |publisher=ESPN|date=2009-04-07 |accessdate=27 August 2014}}</ref>\n\n====2010 national championship: undefeated (39\u20130)====\n{{See also|2009\u201310 Connecticut Huskies women's basketball team}}\nFor the second consecutive year (and the sixth time in school history) UConn finished the regular season undefeated, with an average margin of victory of 35.9 points. During the regular season UConn played 11 games against ranked opponents (including 6 in the top ten) with an average margin of victory of 24. They dominated the Big East Tournament, winning the championship game 60\u201332. Throughout the regular season and the Big East Tournament, UConn's closest win was against Stanford, by 12 points.\n[[File:2010 WhiteHouse.jpg|thumb|450px|left|alt=Whitehouse ceremony commemorating 2010 NCAA National Champions Connecticut Huskies women's basketball team|2010 NCAA National Champions Connecticut Huskies at the White House]]\nLeading up to the Final Four in San Antonio, UConn dominated teams from Southern, Temple, Iowa State and Florida State. Maya Moore and Tina Charles played little more than half the minutes of every game, with Moore averaging one point per minute played, and the team outscoring its opponents by an average of 47 points. In the Final Four UConn was finally challenged by [[Baylor Lady Bears basketball|Baylor]] and the 6-foot-8 freshman [[Brittney Griner]];<ref>{{cite web|author=|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncw/recap?gameId=300940041 |title=Baylor Lady Bears vs. Connecticut Huskies - Recap - April 04, 2010 - ESPN |publisher=Sports.espn.go.com |date=2010-04-04 |accessdate=27 August 2014}}</ref> Baylor trailed 39\u201326 at halftime but UConn finally pulled away for a final score of 70\u201350.\n\nThe national championship game against Stanford was a completely different story. UConn started the game with its worst first half in school history by scoring only 12 points; only 11 teams in tournament history have been held to 12 points or less in the first half: three of them were against UConn teams, and two of them (Southern and Temple) just days earlier in the 2010 Tournament. Stanford itself only managed to score 20 points in the first half. Maya Moore gave UConn the lead (23\u201322) in the second half with a three-pointer and led the team on a scoring run of 30\u20136 that eventually secured the national championship with a final score of 53\u201347.<ref>{{cite web|author=|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/ncw/recap?gameId=300960041 |title=Stanford Cardinal vs. Connecticut Huskies - Recap - April 06, 2010 - ESPN |publisher=Sports.espn.go.com |date=2010-04-06 |accessdate=27 August 2014}}</ref> It was the only game in the Huskies' 78-game winning streak that was won by fewer than 10 points.

Maya Moore returned for her senior season after a summer with the U.S. National team, but UConn lost major contributors Tina Charles and Kalana Greene who graduated in 2010. Additionally, junior guard Caroline Doty would be out the entire season due to a third knee injury.  In an early test, UConn squeaked by #2 Baylor in their second game of the season. They powered their way through 8 more consecutive wins for their 88th straight victory, beating #10 Ohio State at Madison Square Garden. Their 89th win came at home against #20 Florida State to set the college basketball record for most consecutive wins, previously held by the UCLA men's team.  After a break in the schedule for the holidays, UConn traveled out west and beat the Pacific Tigers to stretch the streak to 90 games.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/ncw/topics/_/page/uconn-huskies-win-streak |title=Connecticut Huskies' 90-Game Win Streak - Women's College Basketball Topics - ESPN |publisher=Espn.go.com |date= |accessdate=10 April 2015}}</ref> That game, however, was largely a warm-up match for their biggest test of the season, a December 30 matchup at the powerhouse Stanford Cardinal. UConn trailed for the entire game and lost for the first time since their April 6, 2008 Final Four appearance (also against the Cardinal). The loss ended the highly publicized [[Basketball winning streaks|winning streak]], as well as their long held spot as the top ranked team in women's basketball which was taken over by Baylor. Connecticut recovered focus after the loss and got through the rest of the regular season undefeated, regaining the #1 ranking along the way after Baylor's loss to Texas Tech in February. They marched through the Big East tournament, including their 3rd victory of the year over Notre Dame in the Big East Tournament Championship Game.\n\nIn the NCAA tournament Final Four UConn met Notre Dame for the fourth time of the season, with the underdog Fighting Irish prevailing and ending UConn's bid for a third straight national championship. The keys to Notre Dame's success were the stellar performance of sophomore [[Skylar Diggins]] and the hot shooting (over 50 percent from the field, a first against UConn in its last 262 games), while UConn had a lack of support for Moore's 36 points.<ref>{{cite web|title=Irish shock UConn in semis|url=https://www.ncaa.com/news/basketball-women/article/2011-04-04/irish-shock-uconn-semis|publisher=NCAA.com|accessdate=13 April 2016}}</ref> Notre Dame went on to the National Championship Game, but were defeated by the Texas A&M Aggies.\n\nDuring 2010\u201311 season Maya Moore posted career highs in scoring (22.3 ppg), assists (4.1 apg) and steals (2.2 spg), sweeping all possible individual honors: she won her 2nd [[Naismith College Player of the Year]] award, her 3rd straight [[Wade Trophy]] (only player in history - freshmen are not eligible for this award), her 2nd [[Associated Press Women's College Basketball Player of the Year]] award, her 2nd [[USBWA Women's National Player of the Year]] award and her 2nd [[John R. Wooden Award]]; she was also voted Big East Player of The Year (3rd time) and a fourth straight unanimous First-Team All-American in WBCA, USBWA and AP polls (second player ever after Oklahoma's [[Courtney Paris]]).\n\nIn her amazing college career Maya Moore won 150 games and only lost 4, amassing a total 3036 points (1st Husky ever and 4th all-time in NCAA division I women's basketball), 1276 rebounds (2nd Husky ever), 310 steals (3rd Husky ever), 544 assists (6th Husky ever) and 204 blocks (4th Husky ever); she is the only women\u2019s basketball player in Division I history to record 2500 points, 1000 rebounds, 500 assists, 250 steals and 150 blocked shots.  On February 28 she was enshrined in the [[Huskies of Honor]] (3rd time ever for an active player).\n\nMaya Moore was also a brilliant college student: she graduated with a 3.7 GPA, earning the [[Elite 88 Award]], and was named Cosida Academic All-America First-Team in 2009, 2010 and 2011, [[List of Women's Basketball Academic All-America Team Members of the Year|Cosida Academic All-America of the Year]] in 2010 and 2011 (1st player to ever repeat) and [[List of Academic All-America Team Members of the Year|All-sports Academic All-America of the Year]] in 2011.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Voepel|first1=Mechelle|title=UConn's Moore leaves incredible legacy|url=http://espn.go.com/ncw/tournament/2011/columns/story?id=6288546&columnist=voepel_mechelle|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=10 April 2016}}</ref>\n\nAfter graduation Maya Moore was selected by the [[Minnesota Lynx]] as the 1st overall pick in the 2011 WNBA draft (4th time for a Husky), also becoming the first female basketball player signed to the Jordan Brand.<ref>{{cite web|title=Maya Moore Becomes First Women's Basketball Player Signed To Jordan Brand|url=https://www.sbnation.com/nba/2011/5/18/2177846/maya-moore-jordan-brand-first-female-basketball-player|publisher=SBNation|accessdate=31 March 2016}}</ref>\n\n===The eye of the storm (2012)===\nThe 2011\u201312 season would inevitably be a new era after Maya Moore's graduation. Her absence and the loss of 6th-man Lorin Dixon left significant holes to fill in the roster. Geno Auriemma seemed to find the right pieces with a freshman class that included [[Kaleena Mosqueda-Lewis]], Brianna Banks and Kiah Stokes. Mosqueda-Lewis was another State Farm/WBCA High School Player of the Year for UConn,<ref name=KML>{{cite web|title=Kaleena Mosqueda-Lewis|url=http://espn.go.com/high-school/girls-basketball/recruiting/player/_/id/66471|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=26 November 2011}}</ref> Banks was a highly rated guard,<ref name=Banks>{{cite web|title=Brianna Banks|url=http://espn.go.com/high-school/girls-basketball/recruiting/player/_/id/73104|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=26 November 2011}}</ref> and Stokes, a 6'3 post player, was highly ranked as well. Other key players included sophomores [[Stefanie Dolson]] and [[Bria Hartley]], junior [[Kelly Faris]] and senior [[Tiffany Hayes]], who would be all selected in the WNBA drafts after graduation.\n\nEven if the Huskies were still a strong national contender, they were no longer viewed as a favorite to win it all. Two key rivals were the usual conference foe Notre Dame and the new rival Baylor, who had the nation's top player in [[Brittney Griner]]. In December Griner led #1 ranked Baylor against #2 UConn, scoring 25 points to go along with nine blocks. The 66\u201361 loss was UConn's first of the season, but not its last. Notre Dame, led by junior star [[Skylar Diggins-Smith|Skylar Diggins]], beat the Huskies twice in the regular season, but UConn was able to reverse the roles in the Big East Tournament Championship Game; the win was the school's 15th conference title, as well as the 800th career win for coach Geno Auriemma. Ultimately Notre Dame found its revenge with an upset win in the NCAA Tournament Final Four, ending the season with a 3\u20131 record against the Huskies, a record that would be repeated the following year.\n\n===Breanna Stewart era (2013\u20132016)===\n====2013 national championship====\n{{See also|2012\u201313 Connecticut Huskies women's basketball team}}\n[[File:2013 UConn Women's Basketball team at the White House.JPG|thumb|450 px|The 2013 UConn Women's Basketball team is greeted by President Obama at the White House]]\nThe 2012\u201313 season began with high hopes having UConn landed three highly ranked recruits: #1 overall [[Breanna Stewart]] from [[Cicero \u2013 North Syracuse High School]], forward [[Morgan Tuck]] and guard [[Moriah Jefferson]]. Their play was uneven during the regular season, where UConn went 27\u20133 with a loss to Baylor and a pair of losses to Notre Dame (including a three-overtime game in South Bend); in the Big East tournament UConn lost a third straight time to Notre Dame that delivered a last-minute comeback. In the NCAA tournament UConn key-players Stewart, [[Kaleena Mosqueda-Lewis]], [[Stefanie Dolson]] and senior [[Kelly Faris]] raised their level of play, and UConn easily advanced to the Final Four; in the semifinals they handily beat Notre Dame and in the finals they obtained a 93\u201360 win over Louisville, who had earlier upset Baylor, for a record tying eighth national championship.\n\nThe end of 2012\u201313 season saw the [[2010\u201313 Big East Conference realignment|breakup of the Big East Conference]]. First Pittsburgh, Syracuse and Notre Dame defected to the [[Atlantic Coast Conference]], with Louisville announcing later they would follow in 2014.  Then, the non-FBS football playing members of the Big East (Georgetown, Villanova, Providence, DePaul, Marquette, Seton Hall, St. John's), known colloquially as the \"[[2010\u201313 Big East Conference realignment#Catholic 7|Catholic 7]]\", left to form their own conference, taking the conference name with them.

UConn defeated 79\u201358 Notre Dame (hindered by the loss of one of their stars, [[Natalie Achonwa]], who had [[Anterior cruciate ligament injury|torn her ACL]] in the Elite Eight), to finish the season 40\u20130, tying Baylor for the most wins in a season and setting the new record for Championship with nine.<ref>{{cite web|title=Breanna Stewart, Stefanie Dolson lead UConn to record 9th title|url=http://espn.go.com/womens-college-basketball/recap?gameId=400551354|publisher=ESPN|accessdate=13 April 2016}}</ref> Breanna Stewart was named the AP Player of the year, only the third time in history a sophomore has won the honor.\n\n====2015 national championship====\n{{See also|2014\u201315 UConn Huskies women's basketball team}}\nThe 2014\u201315 regular season started with an overtime loss to Stanford in the second game of the season, ending a 47-games winning streak for UConn. Led by juniors Stewart and Jefferson and senior [[Kaleena Mosqueda-Lewis]], UConn quickly recovered winning every other season game, including a 76\u201358 win against rival Notre Dame. In the National Tournament, both Connecticut and Notre Dame were seeded first in their respective playoff brackets; each advanced to the Final Four held in Tampa, Florida. Connecticut defeated Maryland 81\u201358, while Notre Dame narrowly beat South Carolina, 66\u201365, in the semifinals.\n\nThe teams met again on April 7, 2015 in the national championship game.

Writing for himself and three other judges, he stated:<blockquote>Dignity cannot exist without privacy. Both reside within the inalienable values of life, liberty and freedom which the Constitution has recognised. Privacy is the ultimate expression of the sanctity of the individual. It is a constitutional value which straddles across the spectrum of fundamental rights and protects for the individual a zone of choice and self-determination.<ref name=\":0\" /></blockquote>The judgment is also noteworthy for Justice Chandrachud\u2019s observations on sexual autonomy and privacy.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thewire.in/law/justice-chandrachud-judgment-right-to-privacy|title=Key Highlights of Justice Chandrachud's Judgment in the Right to Privacy Case|website=The Wire|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref> In 2013, a two judge Bench of the Supreme Court of India in [[Suresh Kumar Koushal v.

Justice Chandrachud referred to the decision as striking \u201ca discordant note which directly bears upon the evolution of the constitutional jurisprudence on the right to privacy.\u201d<ref name=\":0\" /> He observed that the decision was wrong as \u201cthe purpose of elevating certain rights to the stature of guaranteed fundamental rights is to insulate their exercise from the disdain of majorities, whether ''legislative or popular''.\u201d<ref name=\":0\" /> He concluded by disagreeing \u201cwith the manner in which Koushal has dealt with the privacy \u2013 dignity-based claims of LGBT persons\u201d<ref name=\":0\" /> and held that:<blockquote>The test of popular acceptance does not furnish a valid basis to disregard rights which are conferred with the sanctity of constitutional protection.\u00a0 Discrete and insular minorities face grave dangers of discrimination for the simple reason that their views, beliefs or way of life does not accord with the \u2018mainstream\u2019. Yet in a democratic constitution founded on the rule of law, their rights are as sacred as those conferred on other citizens to protect their freedoms and liberties.

It often involves the questioning and obliteration of parochial social mores which are antithetical to constitutional morality\u2026The ability to make choices within marriage and on every aspect concerning it is a facet of human liberty and dignity which the Constitution protects\u2026 Implicit in seeking to privilege the fidelity of women in a marriage, is the assumption that a woman contracts away her sexual agency when entering a marriage. That a woman, by marriage, consents in advance to sexual relations with her husband or to refrain from sexual relations outside marriage without the permission of her husband is offensive to liberty and dignity. Such a notion has no place in the constitutional order. Sexual autonomy constitutes an inviolable core of the dignity of every individual.<ref name=\":4\" /></blockquote>His concurring opinion was noticed for its emphasis on the sexual autonomy of women even within the bounds of a marital relationship.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.barandbench.com/news/marital-rape-debate-justice-dy-chandrachud-right-say-no-marriage|title=Marital Rape Debate: Justice DY Chandrachud on Right to say \u201cno\u201d after Marriage|last=Krishnan|first=Murali|website=Bar and Bench - Indian Legal news|language=en|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.businesstoday.in/current/economy-politics/husband-not-the-master-of-his-wife-supreme-court-scraps-150-year-old-law-made-adultery-crime/story/282918.html|title='Husband not the master of his wife': Supreme Court scraps 150-year-old law that made adultery a crime|website=www.businesstoday.in|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref> He held that:<blockquote>\u2026. in adjudicating on the rights of women, the Court is not taking on a paternalistic role and \u201cgranting\u201d rights.

Equally important is responsive, inclusive, participatory and representative decision making. Environmental governance is founded on the rule of law and emerges from the values of our Constitution. Where the health of the environment is key to preserving the right to life as a constitutionally recognized value under Article 21 of the Constitution, proper structures for environmental decision making find expression in the guarantee against arbitrary action and the affirmative duty of fair treatment under Article 14 of the Constitution.<ref name=\":8\" /></blockquote>Justice Chandrachud has also authored a judgment on the validity of grating ''ex post facto'' Environmental Clearances in Alembic Pharmaceuticals Ltd v Rohit Prajapati.<ref name=\":9\">{{Cite web|url=https://main.sci.gov.in/supremecourt/2016/2562/2562_2016_0_1501_21582_Judgement_01-Apr-2020.pdf|title=Alembic Judgment|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> The erstwhile Ministry of Environmental and Forests had issued an administrative circular in 2002 envisaging the grant of ''ex post facto'' clearances to those industries that had failed to comply with the mandatory EIA notification of 1994. The ex post facto clearances granted to a group of drug and pharmaceutical companies located in Gujarat were challenged. Justice Chandrachud set aside the administrative circular of 2002 and noted that the concept of ''ex post facto'' ECs derogates from the fundamental principles of the environmental rule of law. He noted that the grant of ''ex post facto'' ECs was contrary to both the precautionary principle as well as the principal of sustainable development.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.deccanherald.com/national/sc-penalises-three-pharma-cos-asks-to-pay-fine-of-rs-10-cr-each-820450.html|title=SC penalises three pharma cos, asks to pay fine of Rs 10 Cr each|date=2020-04-02|website=Deccan Herald|language=en|access-date=2020-04-21}}</ref> Justice Chandrachud noted that all the industries in question had made significant infrastructural investments.

Allowing for an ex post facto clearance would essentially condone the operation of industrial activities without the grant of an EC. In the absence of an EC, there would be no conditions that would safeguard the environment. Moreover, if the EC was to be ultimately refused, irreparable harm would have been caused to the environment. In either view of the matter, environment law cannot countenance the notion of an ex post facto clearance. This would be contrary to both the precautionary principle as well as the need for sustainable development.<ref name=\":9\" /></blockquote>\n\n=== Constitutional Judgments on Governance ===\n\n==== Ordinances ====\nJustice Chandrachud was a part of the seven-judge bench in Krishna Kumar Singh v.

This approach, with respect fails to notice the critical distinction between an enactment of a competent legislature and an ordinance.

The enduring rights theory attributes a degree of permanence to the power to promulgate ordinances in derogation of parliamentary control and supremacy.<ref name=\":10\" /></blockquote>He also observed that laying down ordinances before the Parliament is a mandatory constitutional obligation that cannot be bypassed.

It was observed that he had to follow the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers, except when the matter was related to police, public order and land. It was also held that by virtue of Article 239AA(4) of the Indian Constitution, the Lieutenant Governor could, in the case of any disagreement between the Delhi Government and the Lieutenant Governor, refer \u2018exceptional\u2019 matters to the President seeking his opinion. In such cases, the decision of the President would be final.

Justice Chandrachud emphasized on the obligation of the Lieutenant Governor to abide by the aid and advice of the Delhi Government and observed that the interpretation that aids the basic features of representative governance and the cabinet form of government should be adopted. He held:<blockquote>\u2026in defining the ambit of the constitutional powers entrusted to the Council of Ministers for the NCT and their relationship with Lieutenant Governor as a delegate of the President, the Court cannot be unmindful of the constitutional importance which has to be assigned to representative government. Representative government is a hallmark of a Constitution which is wedded to democracy for it is through a democratic form of governance that the aspirations of those who elect their representatives are met.</blockquote>\n\n==== The Floor test as a means of ensuring collective responsibility ====\nJustice Chandrachud authored a judgment with far reaching consequences in the political sphere in Shivraj Singh Chouhan. v. Speaker, Madhya Pradesh Legislative Assembly.<ref name=\":11\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.livelaw.in/pdf_upload/pdf_upload-373058.pdf|title=MP Floor test Judgment|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Justice Chandrachud held that the Governor\u2019s exercise of power to convene the legislative assembly for a floor test during an ongoing session of the assembly was \u201clegitimate to the purpose of ensuring that the norm of collective responsibility is duly preserved\u201d. He accepted the submission that the Governor commands the power to order a floor test if the Governor has \u2013 based on \u201cobjective material\u201d \u2013 reasons to believe that the government has lost its majority. Significantly, he noted that the power of the Governor is not unbridled in the following terms:<blockquote>Where the exercise of the discretion by the Governor to call a floor test is challenged before the court, it is not immune from judicial review. The court is entitled to determine whether in calling for the floor test, the Governor did so on the basis of objective material and reasons \u00a0which were relevant and germane to the exercise of the power. The exercise of such a power is not intended to destabilize or displace a democratically elected government accountable to the legislative assembly and collectively responsible to it.<ref name=\":11\" /></blockquote>In a first of its kind observation, Justice Chandrachud also noted the state of politics in the country and called for changes to strengthen the nature of the Indian democratic system in the following terms:<blockquote>The spectacle of rival political parties whisking away their political flock to safe destinations does little credit to the state our democratic politics. It is an unfortunate reflection of the confidence \u00a0which political parties hold in their own constituents and a reflection of what happens in the real world of the politics to lure away persons from rival camps\u2026 It is best that courts maintain an arm\u2019s length from the sordid tales of political life. In defining constitutional principle, however, this Court must be conscious of the position on the ground as admitted by Counsel of both sides and an effort has to be made to the extent possible to ensure that democratic values prevail.<ref name=\":11\" /></blockquote>\n\n=== Affirmative Action ===\nJustice Chandrachud has authored numerous judgments on affirmative action in India. Foremost amongst these is his judgment in B.K. Pavitra II v.

Justice Chandrachud held that the \u201cwithdrawal of civil benefits flowed as a logical result of the validation of a claim to belong to a group or category for whom the reservation is intended\u201d and that \u201cthe selection of ineligible persons is a manifestation of a systematic failure and has deleterious effects on good governance.\u201d Observing that the governing state legislation explicitly specified the consequences of relying upon a false caste certificate, the Court held that recourse to the inherent powers of the Supreme Court under Article 142 would not be justified. In the same vein, Justice Chandrachud observed that where there was a statutory bar to conferring benefits on the basis of a false certificate, administrative circulars and government resolutions, being subservient to legislative mandate, would not be permitted to cure the defect of a false caste certificate.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.livelaw.in/top-stories/appointment-secured-fraudulent-caste-certificates-void-ab-initio-153836|title=Appointment Secured On The Basis Of A Fraudulent Caste Certificate Is Void Ab Initio: SC [Read Order]|last=Kini|first=Ashok|date=2020-03-14|website=www.livelaw.in|language=en|access-date=2020-04-21}}</ref>\n\n=== Commercial and Insurance Law ===\nJustice Chandrachud has also authored opinions in several commercial disputes and emphasized the principles of certainty and objectivity in the area of commercial law. He rejected the challenge by Adani Gas Limited<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://main.sci.gov.in/supremecourt/2019/14043/14043_2019_8_1502_20635_Judgement_17-Feb-2020.pdf|title=Adani Judgment|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> to the grant of authorisations for the construction and operation of consumer gas distribution networks in the state of Tamil Nadu. The dispute concerned the alleged addition of certain bidding criteria ''after the last date for bidding''.\u00a0 In upholding the decisions taken by the Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board, Justice Chandrachud noted that the\u00a0 \u00a0additional criteria had only been proposed by the regulator as an agenda item, but was never subsequently adopted. He also observed that when a tender is challenged by a bidder, the dispute remains solely between the bidder and the regulator, and the regulator\u2019s treatment of other bids that have no bearing on the disputed bid cannot be used to allege a case of arbitrariness against the regulator\u2019s actions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.outlookindia.com/newsscroll/sc-dismisses-adani-gas-plea-against-piped-gas-distribution-award/1741786|title=SC dismisses Adani Gas'' plea against piped gas distribution award|website=https://www.outlookindia.com/|access-date=2020-04-21}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.financialexpress.com/industry/cgd-authorisation-supreme-court-dismisses-appeals-of-adani-gas-imc/1871031/|title=CGD authorisation: Supreme Court dismisses appeals of Adani Gas, IMC|date=2020-02-18|website=The Financial Express|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-21}}</ref>\n\nJustice Chandrachud also authored a judgment governing the liquidation of Super Bazar. The once-iconic Co-Operative Society had fallen on hard times and Writers and Publishers had won the bid to revive Super Bazar under a court regulated recovery scheme. However, an audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General of India found several accounting irregularities in the management of Super Bazar by Writers and Publishers. \u00a0Justice Chandrachud\u2019s judgment held that it would be against the first principles of insolvency if a resolution applicant were to be refunded their investment after a failed revival effort. His opinion directed that Super Bazar\u2019s assets be handed over to the official liquidator and disposed of in accordance with the statutory order of preferences.\n\n'''''Insurance Law'''''\n\nJustice Chandrachud has authored opinions regarding the interpretation of insurance contracts. In one such decision,<ref name=\":13\">{{Cite web|url=https://main.sci.gov.in/supremecourt/2016/25167/25167_2016_Judgement_24-Apr-2019.pdf|title=Insurance Judgment|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> a claim was filed by the wife of the deceased who while riding his motorcycle, experienced pain in the chest and shoulder, suffered a heart attack and fell from the motorcycle. Justice Chandrachud discussed extensively the jurisprudence on insurance law in various jurisdictions, dealt with the interpretation of the expressions \u2018accident\u2019, \u2018bodily injury\u2019 and \u2018outward, violent and visible means\u2019.

Justice Chandrachud noted that the system of adequate disclosures helps to narrow down the gap of information asymmetries between the parties and helps the insurers to assess their risk appetite. He held:<blockquote>Proposal forms are a significant part of the disclosure procedure and warrant accuracy of statements. Utmost care must be exercised in filling the proposal form. In a proposal form the applicant declares that she/he warrants truth. The contractual duty so imposed is such that any suppression, untruth or inaccuracy in the statement in the proposal form will be considered as a breach of the duty of good faith and will render the policy voidable by the insurer. The system of adequate disclosure helps buyers and sellers of insurance policies to meet at a common point and narrow down the gap of information asymmetries</blockquote>In a judgment reported in national media,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.barandbench.com/news/death-malaria-mosquito-bite-accident-supreme-court|title=Is Death due to Malaria from Mosquito Bite a Death due to Accident?

[[World Bank Chief Economist]] [[Paul Romer]] described Aadhaar as \u201cthe most sophisticated ID programme in the world\u201d. As the basis for the overarching system had been laid down in 2010, the Aadhaar system was subject to a wide range of orders by the Supreme Court between 2013 and 2019. The Act was challenged before the Supreme Court on numerous grounds, which included a charge of by passing the Upper House or Rajya Sabha by being passed as a Money Bill, of \u00a0creating a surveillance state, and creating a class of citizens which would be excluded from the class of beneficiaries.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.prsindia.org/theprsblog/overview-legal-issues-around-aadhaar|title=Overview of the Legal Issues around Aadhaar|date=2017-06-10|website=PRSIndia|language=en|access-date=2020-04-21}}</ref> Some groups also raised significant privacy concerns with the government database that held the biometric and personal information of every individual in the country.\n\nIn the judgment dated 28 September 2018, the Indian Supreme Court upheld that constitutional validity of the Act by a 4-1 majority, with Justice Chandrachud penning the sole dissent.

He held:<blockquote>The risks which the use of Aadhaar \u201cfor any purpose\u201d carries is that when it is linked with different databases (managed by the State or by private entities), the Aadhaar number becomes the central unifying feature that connects the cell phone with geo-location data, one\u2019s presence and movement with a bank account and income tax returns, food and lifestyle consumption with medical records. This starts a \u201ccausal link\u201d between information \u00a0which was usually unconnected and was considered trivial. Thus, <u>linking Aadhaar with different databases</u> carries the potential of being profiled into a system, which could be used for commercial purposes. It also carries the capability of influencing the behavioural patterns of individuals, by affecting their privacy and liberty. Profiling individuals could be used to create co-relations between human lives, which are generally unconnected\u2026 When Aadhaar is seeded into every database, ''it becomes a bridge across discreet data silos'', which allows anyone with access to this information to re-construct a profile of an individual\u2019s life.<ref name=\":15\" /></blockquote>At the time when the case was being heard before the Supreme Court, whistleblowers\u00a0had warned of the possible implications of the infrastructure in creating a surveillance state.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/aadhaar-is-mass-surveillance-system-will-lead-to-civil-death-for-indians-edward-snowden-1319121-2018-08-20|title=Aadhaar is mass surveillance system, will lead to civil death for Indians: Edward Snowden|last=DelhiAugust 20|first=India Today Tech New|last2=August 20|first2=2018UPDATED:|website=India Today|language=en|access-date=2020-04-21|last3=Ist|first3=2018 16:25}}</ref> Following the judgment, academicians documented the growth in state surveillance<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://jsis.washington.edu/news/the-aadhaar-card-cybersecurity-issues-with-indias-biometric-experiment/|title=The Aadhaar Card: Cybersecurity Issues with India's Biometric Experiment|date=2019-05-09|website=The Henry M.

He held that the absence of consent within the Act, the extent of information disclosed, the expansive scope of the term \u201cbiometrics\u201d, the burden placed upon the individual to update her own biometrics, and lack of access to the record, cumulatively constitute a serious infringement of privacy.<ref name=\":16\" />\n\n==== ''Proportionality'' ====\nJustice Chandrachud drew from academic literature as well as jurisprudence across national frontiers on the proportionality standard and held that the burden to justify that the method adopted lies on the state and it must be demonstrated that the chosen method is both necessary and the least intrusive manner of achieving the stated objective. Circumspect of the Aadhaar infrastructure in plugging loopholes in welfare leakages, he held that:<blockquote>The test of proportionality stipulates that the nature and extent of the State\u2019s interference with the exercise of a right (in this case, the rights to privacy, dignity, choice, and access to basic entitlements) must be proportionate to the goal it seeks to achieve (in this case, purported plugging of welfare leakage and better targeting\u2026 \u2026 by collecting identity information, the Aadhaar program treats every citizen as a potential criminal without even requiring the State to draw a reasonable belief that a citizen might be perpetrating a crime or an identity fraud. When the State is not required to have a reasonable belief and judicial determination to this effect, a program like Aadhaar, which infringes on the justifiable expectations of privacy of citizens flowing from the Constitution, is completely disproportionate to the objective sought to be achieved by the State\u2026 the state has failed to demonstrate that a less intrusive measure other than biometric authentication will not sub serve its purposes.<ref name=\":15\" /></blockquote>As part of his analysis, he noted the potential of the Aadhaar infrastructure to further bread inequality and the burden on the state to remedy any potential failings ''prior'' to the implementation of a nation wide infrastructure. He held:<blockquote>Technological error would result in authentication failures. The concerns raised by UIDAI ought to have been resolved before the implementation of the Aadhaar project. Poor connectivity in rural India was a major concern. The majority of the Indian population lives in rural areas. Even a small percentage of error results in a population of crores being affected. Denial of subsidies and benefits to them due to the infirmities of biometric technology is a threat to good governance and social parity\u2026 No failure rate in the provision of social welfare benefits can be regarded as acceptable. Basic entitlements in matters such as food grain, can brook no error. To deny food is to lead a family to destitution, malnutrition and even death.<ref name=\":15\" /></blockquote>\n\n==== ''Money Bill'' ====\nConsidered the \u2018heart\u2019 of his dissent,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ijlpp.com/the-aadhaar-judgment-legal-complications-of-a-money-bill/|title=THE AADHAAR JUDGMENT : LEGAL COMPLICATIONS OF A MONEY BILL|date=2018-10-23|website=THE INDIAN JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-21}}</ref> , Justice Chandrachud struck down of the entire Act as it was passed as a [[Money bill]]. Justice Chandrachud noted that while \u201cOrdinary bills can be passed only when they are agreed to by both Houses\u2026 the Constitution carves out a limited role for the Rajya Sabha in the passage of Money Bills.\u201d<ref name=\":15\" /> He noted that in the case of a Money Bill, the Rajya Sabha has no amending power, but merely the power to recommend changes \u00a0which are not binding on the Lok Sabha. In other words, any \u00a0change that the Rajya Sabha wishes to seek in the bill can be rejected in its entirety by the Lok Sabha.\n\nJustice Chandrachud proceeded by affirming that there is a degree of \u201cconstitutional trust\u201d that attaches to a certificate by the Speaker of the House certifying a bill as a Money Bill and is open to judicial review:<blockquote>The purpose of judicial review is to ensure that constitutional principles prevail in interpretation and governance. Institutions created by the Constitution are subject to its norms. No constitutional institution wields absolute power. No immunity has been attached to the certificate of the Speaker of the Lok Sabha from judicial review, for this reason\u2026 Constitutional \u00a0courts have been entrusted with the duty to scrutinize the exercise of power by public functionaries under the Constitution. No individual holding an institutional office created by the Constitution can act contrary to constitutional parameters... If our Constitution has to survive the vicissitudes of political aggrandisement and to face up to the prevailing cynicism about all constitutional institutions, notions of power and authority must give way to duties and compliance with the rule of law<ref name=\":15\" /></blockquote>Justice Chandrachud embarked on an analysis of the origins and rationale of bicameralism to conclude:<blockquote>Bicameralism, when entrenched as a principle in a constitutional democracy, acts as a check against the abuse of power by constitutional means or its use in an oppressive manner. As a subset of the constitutional principle of division of power, bicameralism is mainly a safeguard against the abuse of the constitutional and political process. A bicameral national parliament can hold the government accountable and can check or restrain the misuse of government power. Among its other roles is that of representing local state units, acting as a body of expert review, and providing representation for diverse socio-economic interests or ethno-cultural minorities.<ref name=\":15\" /></blockquote>After embarking on a comparative analysis of bicameralism across the world, Justice Chandrachud grounded Indian bicameralism in both a commitment to a federal polity as well as participative governance to hold that the Rajya Sabha is a \u201csymbol against majoritarianism\u201d.\n\nHe extensively analysed Article 110 of the Indian Constitution and emphasized that any bill within the ambit of Article 110 must contain \u201conly provisions\u201d dealing with the matter specified therein. Laying emphasis on the use of the words \u201cif\u201d and \u201conly\u201d within the provision, he cautioned that judges \u201ccannot rewrite the Constitution, particularly where it is contrary to both text, context and intent.\u201d He noted that to allow bills that traverse outside the scope of Article 110 to be passed as money Bills would have \u201cconsequences in terms of the nature of the Bill and the legislative participation of the Rajya Sabha,\u201d and \u201creduce bicameralism to an illusion.\u201d He held:<blockquote>A Bill, to be a Money Bill, must contain only provisions which fall within the ambit of the matters mentioned in Article 110\u2026The Lok Sabha cannot introduce and pass a legislative measure in the garb of a Money Bill, which could otherwise have been amended or rejected by the Rajya Sabha. Bicameralism is a founding value of our democracy. It is a part of the basic structure of the Constitution. Introduction and passing of a Bill as a Money Bill, which does not qualify to be a Money Bill under Article 110(1) of the Constitution, is plainly unconstitutional\u2026 Introducing the Aadhaar Act as a Money Bill has bypassed the constitutional authority of the Rajya Sabha. The passage of the Aadhaar Act as a Money Bill is an abuse of the constitutional process. It deprived the Rajya Sabha from altering the provisions of the Bill by carrying out amendments.. Superseding the authority of the Rajya Sabha is in conflict with the constitutional scheme and the legitimacy of democratic institutions. It constitutes a fraud on the Constitution\u2026 This debasement of a democratic institution cannot be allowed to pass. Institutions are crucial to democracy. Debasing them can only cause a peril to democratic structures.<ref name=\":15\" /></blockquote>One academician wrote shortly thereafter that Justice Chandrachud\u2019s reading of the constitutional provision and assessment of the Aadhaar Act upheld \u201cthe delicate balance of bicameralism\u201d which lies at the heart of India\u2019s parliamentary democracy\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://indconlawphil.wordpress.com/2018/10/01/the-aadhaar-judgment-and-the-constitution-iii-on-the-money-bill-guest-post/|title=The Aadhaar Judgment and the Constitution \u2013 III: On the Money Bill (Guest Post)|last=Bhatia|first=Gautam|date=2018-10-01|website=Indian Constitutional Law and Philosophy|language=en|access-date=2020-04-21}}</ref>\n\n==== ''Individual, State and Identity'' ====\nJustice Chandrachud\u2019s judgment also analysed the intersection between identity and individuals. The dissent was noted for the emphasis on the protection of individual identity. Emphasising on the plurality of identities of an individual, he observed that:<blockquote>Technologically, at this level, Aadhaar was to be a means of identification. Yet at another level, the Aadhaar project also offered itself as providing a documentary identity to persons who may not have possessed one at all... Identity includes the right to determine the forms through which identity is expressed and the right not to be identified. That concept is now \u201cflipped\u201d so that identification through identifiers becomes the only form of identity in the time of database governance. This involves a radical transformation in the position of the individual\u2026Identity is a plural concept. The Constitution also recognizes a multitude of identities through the plethora of rights that it safeguards. The technology deployed in the Aadhaar scheme reduces different constitutional identities into a single identity of a 12-digit number and infringes the right if an individual to identify himself/herself through a chosen means. Aadhaar is about identification and is an instrument which facilitates a prof of identity. It must not be allowed to obliterate constitutional identity.</blockquote>He analysed the intersection between law and technology and observed that the biometric technology \u201cwhich is the core of the Aadhaar programme is probabilistic in nature, leading to authentication failures.\u201d He observed that:<blockquote>Dignity and the rights of individuals cannot be made to depend on algorithms or probabilities.

Aadhaar is about identification and is an instrument which facilitates a proof of identity. It must not be allowed to obliterate constitutional identity\u2026From reading the judgments, in this case, Dr Chandrachud J, in my respectful view, demonstrated a greater sensitivity to the issues of privacy and freedom that is not as evident in the judgments of the majority of the other judges who delivered concurring judgments. His Lordship had a clear-eyed view of the dangers of a state or anyone having control over one\u2019s personal information and generally, I preferred his approach to the issue over that of the other judges\u2026 I must also say that in the application of the standard I prefer the reasoning of Dr Chandrachud J to that of the majority.</blockquote>One constitutional law expert observed<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://indconlawphil.wordpress.com/2019/04/13/the-afterlife-of-the-aadhaar-dissent-the-jamaican-supreme-court-strikes-down-a-national-biometric-identification-system/|title=The Afterlife of the Aadhaar Dissent: The Jamaican Supreme Court Strikes Down a National Biometric Identification System|last=Bhatia|first=Gautam|date=2019-04-13|website=Indian Constitutional Law and Philosophy|language=en|access-date=2020-04-21}}</ref> that:<blockquote>\u2026a dissent is not limited to a footnote in the judicial lore of a nation, waiting for the years to pass by until the \u201cintelligence of a future day\u201d dawns.

Noting deficiencies in the reasoning of the majority in the Aadhaar judgment and referring the question of law on Money Bills to a Bench of a higher strength, he stated:<blockquote>Upon an extensive examination of the matter, we notice that the majority in K.S.

It is clear to us that the majority dictum in K.S. Puttaswamy (Aadhaar-5) did not substantially discuss the effect of the word \u2018only\u2019 in Article 110(1) and offers little guidance on the repercussions of a finding when some of the provisions of an enactment passed as a \u201cMoney Bill\u201d do not conform to Article 110(1)(a) to (g)\u2026 Being a Bench of equal strength as that in K.S.

He stated:<blockquote>\u2026the employment of state machinery to curb dissent instils fear and creates a chilling atmosphere on free speech which violates the rule of law and detracts from the constitutional vision of a pluralist society\u2026The true test of a democracy is its ability to ensure the creation and protection of spaces where every individual can voice their opinion without the fear of retribution\u2026A state committed to the rule of law ensures that the state apparatus is not employed to curb legitimate and peaceful protest but to create spaces conducive for deliberation. Within the bounds of law, liberal democracies ensure that their citizens enjoy the right to express their views in every conceivable manner, including the right to protest and express dissent against prevailing laws. The blanket labelling of such dissent as \u2018anti-national\u2019 or \u2018anti-democratic\u2019 strikes at the heart of our commitment to the protection of constitutional values and the promotion of a deliberative democracy.</blockquote>In an impassioned appeal to pluralism and the celebration of diversity, he stated:<blockquote>The framers of the Constitution rejected the notion of a Hindu India and a Muslim India. They recognised only the Republic of India\u2026A united India is not one characterized by a single identity devoid of its rich plurality, both of cultures and of values. National unity denotes a shared culture of values and a commitment to the fundamental ideals of the Constitution in which all individuals are guaranteed not just the fundamental rights but also conditions for their free and safe exercise. Pluralism depicts not merely a commitment to the preservation of diversity, but a commitment to the fundamental postulates of individual and equal dignity. In this sense, pluralism furthers the basic postulates of the Constitution and nourishes and provides content to the goal of national unity...No single individual or institution can claim a monopoly over the idea of India\u2026what is of utmost relevance today is our ability and commitment to preserve, conserve and build on the rich pluralistic history we have inherited.</blockquote>The speech was reported <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.indialegallive.com/top-news-of-the-day/news/dissent-not-anti-national-says-justice-dy-chandrachud-89239|title=Dissent Not Anti-National excerpts/ Justice PD Desai Memorial Lecture 2020|last=Legal|first=India|date=2020-02-22|website=India Legal|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.outlookindia.com/newsscroll/blanket-labelling-of-dissent-as-antinational-hurts-ethos-of/1735088|title=Blanket labelling of dissent as anti-national hurts ethos of|website=https://www.outlookindia.com/|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://punemirror.indiatimes.com/news/india/dissent-a-safety-valve-justice-chandrachud/articleshow/74156371.cms|title=Dissent a safety valve: Justice Chandrachud|last=Feb 16|first=PTI {{!}} Updated:|last2=2020|website=Pune Mirror|language=en|access-date=2020-04-20|last3=Ist|first3=08:07}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.livelaw.in/top-stories/hindu-india-and-a-muslim-indiajustice-chandrachud-152796|title='The Framers of Constitution Rejected The Notion of a Hindu India And a Muslim India':Justice Chandrachud [Read Full Text Of Speech]|last=NETWORK|first=LIVELAW NEWS|date=2020-02-16|website=www.livelaw.in|language=en|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref> as a plea to protect the right to dissent in a free and democratic society.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070806180624/http://www.vmslaw.edu/sympo.htm Millennium laws For India Inc.---A symposium]\n* [http://lawcommissionofindia.nic.in/adr_conf/chandrachud3.pdf M E D I A T I O N \u2013 realizing the potential and designing. implementation strategies.]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070928170649/http://www.humanrightsinitiative.org/jc/papers/jc_2002/judges_papers/chandrachud_final.pdf First South Asian Regional Judicial Colloquium on Access to Justice]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070820184647/http://www.humanrightsinitiative.org/jc/papers/jc_2003/background_papers.htm CHRI: Judicial Colloquia Series on Access to Justice]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070702192624/http://www.interights.org/page.php?dir=News Justiciability of Economic, Social and Cultural Rights in the Pacific\u2014A judicial colloquium and workshop]\n* [http://www.allahabadhighcourt.in/service/judgeDetail.jsp?id=203|High Court of Judicature at Allahabad]\n\n{{Sitting Judges of the Supreme Court of India}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Chandrachud, Dhananjaya Y.}}\n[[Category:20th-century Indian judges]]\n[[Category:1959 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Faculty of Law, University of Delhi alumni]]\n[[Category:Harvard Law School alumni]]\n[[Category:Indian solicitors]]\n[[Category:Judges of the Mumbai High Court]]\n[[Category:St. Columba's School, Delhi alumni]]\n[[Category:Chief Justices of the Allahabad High Court]]\n[[Category:Justices of the Supreme Court of India]]\n[[Category:21st-century Indian judges]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Indian judge}}\n{{Use Indian English|date=August 2015}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2019}}\n{{Infobox officeholder\n| honorific-prefix    = Hon'ble Dr. Justice\n| name                = Dhananjaya Yeshwant Chandrachud\n| honorific-suffix    = \n| image               = File:Justice D.Y.

Writing for himself and three other judges, he stated:<blockquote>Dignity cannot exist without privacy. Both reside within the inalienable values of life, liberty and freedom which the Constitution has recognised. Privacy is the ultimate expression of the sanctity of the individual. It is a constitutional value which straddles across the spectrum of fundamental rights and protects for the individual a zone of choice and self-determination.<ref name=\":0\" /></blockquote>The judgment is also noteworthy for Justice Chandrachud\u2019s observations on sexual autonomy and privacy.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thewire.in/law/justice-chandrachud-judgment-right-to-privacy|title=Key Highlights of Justice Chandrachud's Judgment in the Right to Privacy Case|website=The Wire|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref> In 2013, a two judge Bench of the Supreme Court of India in [[Suresh Kumar Koushal v.

Justice Chandrachud referred to the decision as striking \u201ca discordant note which directly bears upon the evolution of the constitutional jurisprudence on the right to privacy.\u201d<ref name=\":0\" /> He observed that the decision was wrong as \u201cthe purpose of elevating certain rights to the stature of guaranteed fundamental rights is to insulate their exercise from the disdain of majorities, whether ''legislative or popular''.\u201d<ref name=\":0\" /> He concluded by disagreeing \u201cwith the manner in which Koushal has dealt with the privacy \u2013 dignity-based claims of LGBT persons\u201d<ref name=\":0\" /> and held that:<blockquote>The test of popular acceptance does not furnish a valid basis to disregard rights which are conferred with the sanctity of constitutional protection.\u00a0 Discrete and insular minorities face grave dangers of discrimination for the simple reason that their views, beliefs or way of life does not accord with the \u2018mainstream\u2019. Yet in a democratic constitution founded on the rule of law, their rights are as sacred as those conferred on other citizens to protect their freedoms and liberties.

He held that:<blockquote>Free speech cannot be gagged for fear of the mob\u2026Political freedoms impose a restraining influence on the state by carving out an area in which the state shall not interfere. Hence, these freedoms are perceived to impose obligations of restraint on the state. But, apart from imposing \u2018negative\u2019 restraints on the state these freedoms impose a positive mandate as well. In its capacity as a public authority enforcing the rule of law, the state must ensure that conditions in which these freedoms flourish are maintained.

A framework of environmental governance committed to the rule of law requires a regime which has effective, accountable and transparent institutions. Equally important is responsive, inclusive, participatory and representative decision making. Environmental governance is founded on the rule of law and emerges from the values of our Constitution.

The ex post facto clearances granted to a group of drug and pharmaceutical companies located in Gujarat were challenged. Justice Chandrachud set aside the administrative circular of 2002 and noted that the concept of ''ex post facto'' ECs derogates from the fundamental principles of the environmental rule of law. He noted that the grant of ''ex post facto'' ECs was contrary to both the precautionary principle as well as the principal of sustainable development.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.deccanherald.com/national/sc-penalises-three-pharma-cos-asks-to-pay-fine-of-rs-10-cr-each-820450.html|title=SC penalises three pharma cos, asks to pay fine of Rs 10 Cr each|date=2020-04-02|website=Deccan Herald|language=en|access-date=2020-04-21}}</ref> Justice Chandrachud noted that all the industries in question had made significant infrastructural investments.

Allowing for an ex post facto clearance would essentially condone the operation of industrial activities without the grant of an EC. In the absence of an EC, there would be no conditions that would safeguard the environment. Moreover, if the EC was to be ultimately refused, irreparable harm would have been caused to the environment. In either view of the matter, environment law cannot countenance the notion of an ex post facto clearance.

This approach, with respect fails to notice the critical distinction between an enactment of a competent legislature and an ordinance.

It was observed that he had to follow the aid and advice of the Council of Ministers, except when the matter was related to police, public order and land. It was also held that by virtue of Article 239AA(4) of the Indian Constitution, the Lieutenant Governor could, in the case of any disagreement between the Delhi Government and the Lieutenant Governor, refer \u2018exceptional\u2019 matters to the President seeking his opinion. In such cases, the decision of the President would be final.

Justice Chandrachud emphasized on the obligation of the Lieutenant Governor to abide by the aid and advice of the Delhi Government and observed that the interpretation that aids the basic features of representative governance and the cabinet form of government should be adopted. He held:<blockquote>\u2026in defining the ambit of the constitutional powers entrusted to the Council of Ministers for the NCT and their relationship with Lieutenant Governor as a delegate of the President, the Court cannot be unmindful of the constitutional importance which has to be assigned to representative government. Representative government is a hallmark of a Constitution which is wedded to democracy for it is through a democratic form of governance that the aspirations of those who elect their representatives are met.</blockquote>\n\n==== The Floor test as a means of ensuring collective responsibility ====\nJustice Chandrachud authored a judgment with far reaching consequences in the political sphere in Shivraj Singh Chouhan. v. Speaker, Madhya Pradesh Legislative Assembly.<ref name=\":11\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.livelaw.in/pdf_upload/pdf_upload-373058.pdf|title=MP Floor test Judgment|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Justice Chandrachud held that the Governor\u2019s exercise of power to convene the legislative assembly for a floor test during an ongoing session of the assembly was \u201clegitimate to the purpose of ensuring that the norm of collective responsibility is duly preserved\u201d. He accepted the submission that the Governor commands the power to order a floor test if the Governor has \u2013 based on \u201cobjective material\u201d \u2013 reasons to believe that the government has lost its majority. Significantly, he noted that the power of the Governor is not unbridled in the following terms:<blockquote>Where the exercise of the discretion by the Governor to call a floor test is challenged before the court, it is not immune from judicial review. The court is entitled to determine whether in calling for the floor test, the Governor did so on the basis of objective material and reasons \u00a0which were relevant and germane to the exercise of the power. The exercise of such a power is not intended to destabilize or displace a democratically elected government accountable to the legislative assembly and collectively responsible to it.<ref name=\":11\" /></blockquote>In a first of its kind observation, Justice Chandrachud also noted the state of politics in the country and called for changes to strengthen the nature of the Indian democratic system in the following terms:<blockquote>The spectacle of rival political parties whisking away their political flock to safe destinations does little credit to the state our democratic politics. It is an unfortunate reflection of the confidence \u00a0which political parties hold in their own constituents and a reflection of what happens in the real world of the politics to lure away persons from rival camps\u2026 It is best that courts maintain an arm\u2019s length from the sordid tales of political life. In defining constitutional principle, however, this Court must be conscious of the position on the ground as admitted by Counsel of both sides and an effort has to be made to the extent possible to ensure that democratic values prevail.<ref name=\":11\" /></blockquote>\n\n=== Affirmative Action ===\nJustice Chandrachud has authored numerous judgments on affirmative action in India.

Justice Chandrachud held that the \u201cwithdrawal of civil benefits flowed as a logical result of the validation of a claim to belong to a group or category for whom the reservation is intended\u201d and that \u201cthe selection of ineligible persons is a manifestation of a systematic failure and has deleterious effects on good governance.\u201d Observing that the governing state legislation explicitly specified the consequences of relying upon a false caste certificate, the Court held that recourse to the inherent powers of the Supreme Court under Article 142 would not be justified. In the same vein, Justice Chandrachud observed that where there was a statutory bar to conferring benefits on the basis of a false certificate, administrative circulars and government resolutions, being subservient to legislative mandate, would not be permitted to cure the defect of a false caste certificate.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.livelaw.in/top-stories/appointment-secured-fraudulent-caste-certificates-void-ab-initio-153836|title=Appointment Secured On The Basis Of A Fraudulent Caste Certificate Is Void Ab Initio: SC [Read Order]|last=Kini|first=Ashok|date=2020-03-14|website=www.livelaw.in|language=en|access-date=2020-04-21}}</ref>\n\n=== Commercial and Insurance Law ===\nJustice Chandrachud has also authored opinions in several commercial disputes and emphasized the principles of certainty and objectivity in the area of commercial law.

The dispute concerned the alleged addition of certain bidding criteria ''after the last date for bidding''.\u00a0 In upholding the decisions taken by the Petroleum and Natural Gas Regulatory Board, Justice Chandrachud noted that the\u00a0 \u00a0additional criteria had only been proposed by the regulator as an agenda item, but was never subsequently adopted. He also observed that when a tender is challenged by a bidder, the dispute remains solely between the bidder and the regulator, and the regulator\u2019s treatment of other bids that have no bearing on the disputed bid cannot be used to allege a case of arbitrariness against the regulator\u2019s actions.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.outlookindia.com/newsscroll/sc-dismisses-adani-gas-plea-against-piped-gas-distribution-award/1741786|title=SC dismisses Adani Gas'' plea against piped gas distribution award|website=https://www.outlookindia.com/|access-date=2020-04-21}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.financialexpress.com/industry/cgd-authorisation-supreme-court-dismisses-appeals-of-adani-gas-imc/1871031/|title=CGD authorisation: Supreme Court dismisses appeals of Adani Gas, IMC|date=2020-02-18|website=The Financial Express|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-21}}</ref>\n\nJustice Chandrachud also authored a judgment governing the liquidation of Super Bazar. The once-iconic Co-Operative Society had fallen on hard times and Writers and Publishers had won the bid to revive Super Bazar under a court regulated recovery scheme. However, an audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General of India found several accounting irregularities in the management of Super Bazar by Writers and Publishers. \u00a0Justice Chandrachud\u2019s judgment held that it would be against the first principles of insolvency if a resolution applicant were to be refunded their investment after a failed revival effort. His opinion directed that Super Bazar\u2019s assets be handed over to the official liquidator and disposed of in accordance with the statutory order of preferences.\n\n'''''Insurance Law'''''\n\nJustice Chandrachud has authored opinions regarding the interpretation of insurance contracts. In one such decision,<ref name=\":13\">{{Cite web|url=https://main.sci.gov.in/supremecourt/2016/25167/25167_2016_Judgement_24-Apr-2019.pdf|title=Insurance Judgment|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> a claim was filed by the wife of the deceased who while riding his motorcycle, experienced pain in the chest and shoulder, suffered a heart attack and fell from the motorcycle.

Justice Chandrachud noted that the system of adequate disclosures helps to narrow down the gap of information asymmetries between the parties and helps the insurers to assess their risk appetite. He held:<blockquote>Proposal forms are a significant part of the disclosure procedure and warrant accuracy of statements. Utmost care must be exercised in filling the proposal form. In a proposal form the applicant declares that she/he warrants truth. The contractual duty so imposed is such that any suppression, untruth or inaccuracy in the statement in the proposal form will be considered as a breach of the duty of good faith and will render the policy voidable by the insurer. The system of adequate disclosure helps buyers and sellers of insurance policies to meet at a common point and narrow down the gap of information asymmetries</blockquote>In a judgment reported in national media,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.barandbench.com/news/death-malaria-mosquito-bite-accident-supreme-court|title=Is Death due to Malaria from Mosquito Bite a Death due to Accident?

He referred to the World Health Organization\u2019s World Malaria Report 2018 and noted that in a country severely afflicted with Malaria, the mosquito bite was neither unexpected nor unforeseen and therefore, death caused by a mosquito bite would not be covered by the insurance policy.\n\n=== Others ===\nJustice Chandrachud has also authored judgments on access to justice and the commitment to a transparent judicial system.

He held:<blockquote>The risks which the use of Aadhaar \u201cfor any purpose\u201d carries is that when it is linked with different databases (managed by the State or by private entities), the Aadhaar number becomes the central unifying feature that connects the cell phone with geo-location data, one\u2019s presence and movement with a bank account and income tax returns, food and lifestyle consumption with medical records. This starts a \u201ccausal link\u201d between information \u00a0which was usually unconnected and was considered trivial. Thus, <u>linking Aadhaar with different databases</u> carries the potential of being profiled into a system, which could be used for commercial purposes. It also carries the capability of influencing the behavioural patterns of individuals, by affecting their privacy and liberty. Profiling individuals could be used to create co-relations between human lives, which are generally unconnected\u2026 When Aadhaar is seeded into every database, ''it becomes a bridge across discreet data silos'', which allows anyone with access to this information to re-construct a profile of an individual\u2019s life.<ref name=\":15\" /></blockquote>At the time when the case was being heard before the Supreme Court, whistleblowers\u00a0had warned of the possible implications of the infrastructure in creating a surveillance state.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.indiatoday.in/technology/news/story/aadhaar-is-mass-surveillance-system-will-lead-to-civil-death-for-indians-edward-snowden-1319121-2018-08-20|title=Aadhaar is mass surveillance system, will lead to civil death for Indians: Edward Snowden|last=DelhiAugust 20|first=India Today Tech New|last2=August 20|first2=2018UPDATED:|website=India Today|language=en|access-date=2020-04-21|last3=Ist|first3=2018 16:25}}</ref> Following the judgment, academicians documented the growth in state surveillance<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://jsis.washington.edu/news/the-aadhaar-card-cybersecurity-issues-with-indias-biometric-experiment/|title=The Aadhaar Card: Cybersecurity Issues with India's Biometric Experiment|date=2019-05-09|website=The Henry M.

He held that the absence of consent within the Act, the extent of information disclosed, the expansive scope of the term \u201cbiometrics\u201d, the burden placed upon the individual to update her own biometrics, and lack of access to the record, cumulatively constitute a serious infringement of privacy.<ref name=\":16\" />\n\n==== ''Proportionality'' ====\nJustice Chandrachud drew from academic literature as well as jurisprudence across national frontiers on the proportionality standard and held that the burden to justify that the method adopted lies on the state and it must be demonstrated that the chosen method is both necessary and the least intrusive manner of achieving the stated objective. Circumspect of the Aadhaar infrastructure in plugging loopholes in welfare leakages, he held that:<blockquote>The test of proportionality stipulates that the nature and extent of the State\u2019s interference with the exercise of a right (in this case, the rights to privacy, dignity, choice, and access to basic entitlements) must be proportionate to the goal it seeks to achieve (in this case, purported plugging of welfare leakage and better targeting\u2026 \u2026 by collecting identity information, the Aadhaar program treats every citizen as a potential criminal without even requiring the State to draw a reasonable belief that a citizen might be perpetrating a crime or an identity fraud. When the State is not required to have a reasonable belief and judicial determination to this effect, a program like Aadhaar, which infringes on the justifiable expectations of privacy of citizens flowing from the Constitution, is completely disproportionate to the objective sought to be achieved by the State\u2026 the state has failed to demonstrate that a less intrusive measure other than biometric authentication will not sub serve its purposes.<ref name=\":15\" /></blockquote>As part of his analysis, he noted the potential of the Aadhaar infrastructure to further bread inequality and the burden on the state to remedy any potential failings ''prior'' to the implementation of a nation wide infrastructure. He held:<blockquote>Technological error would result in authentication failures. The concerns raised by UIDAI ought to have been resolved before the implementation of the Aadhaar project. Poor connectivity in rural India was a major concern. The majority of the Indian population lives in rural areas. Even a small percentage of error results in a population of crores being affected. Denial of subsidies and benefits to them due to the infirmities of biometric technology is a threat to good governance and social parity\u2026 No failure rate in the provision of social welfare benefits can be regarded as acceptable. Basic entitlements in matters such as food grain, can brook no error. To deny food is to lead a family to destitution, malnutrition and even death.<ref name=\":15\" /></blockquote>\n\n==== ''Money Bill'' ====\nConsidered the \u2018heart\u2019 of his dissent,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://ijlpp.com/the-aadhaar-judgment-legal-complications-of-a-money-bill/|title=THE AADHAAR JUDGMENT : LEGAL COMPLICATIONS OF A MONEY BILL|date=2018-10-23|website=THE INDIAN JOURNAL OF LAW AND PUBLIC POLICY|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-21}}</ref> , Justice Chandrachud struck down of the entire Act as it was passed as a [[Money bill]]. Justice Chandrachud noted that while \u201cOrdinary bills can be passed only when they are agreed to by both Houses\u2026 the Constitution carves out a limited role for the Rajya Sabha in the passage of Money Bills.\u201d<ref name=\":15\" /> He noted that in the case of a Money Bill, the Rajya Sabha has no amending power, but merely the power to recommend changes \u00a0which are not binding on the Lok Sabha. In other words, any \u00a0change that the Rajya Sabha wishes to seek in the bill can be rejected in its entirety by the Lok Sabha.\n\nJustice Chandrachud proceeded by affirming that there is a degree of \u201cconstitutional trust\u201d that attaches to a certificate by the Speaker of the House certifying a bill as a Money Bill and is open to judicial review:<blockquote>The purpose of judicial review is to ensure that constitutional principles prevail in interpretation and governance. Institutions created by the Constitution are subject to its norms. No constitutional institution wields absolute power. No immunity has been attached to the certificate of the Speaker of the Lok Sabha from judicial review, for this reason\u2026 Constitutional \u00a0courts have been entrusted with the duty to scrutinize the exercise of power by public functionaries under the Constitution. No individual holding an institutional office created by the Constitution can act contrary to constitutional parameters... If our Constitution has to survive the vicissitudes of political aggrandisement and to face up to the prevailing cynicism about all constitutional institutions, notions of power and authority must give way to duties and compliance with the rule of law<ref name=\":15\" /></blockquote>Justice Chandrachud embarked on an analysis of the origins and rationale of bicameralism to conclude:<blockquote>Bicameralism, when entrenched as a principle in a constitutional democracy, acts as a check against the abuse of power by constitutional means or its use in an oppressive manner. As a subset of the constitutional principle of division of power, bicameralism is mainly a safeguard against the abuse of the constitutional and political process. A bicameral national parliament can hold the government accountable and can check or restrain the misuse of government power. Among its other roles is that of representing local state units, acting as a body of expert review, and providing representation for diverse socio-economic interests or ethno-cultural minorities.<ref name=\":15\" /></blockquote>After embarking on a comparative analysis of bicameralism across the world, Justice Chandrachud grounded Indian bicameralism in both a commitment to a federal polity as well as participative governance to hold that the Rajya Sabha is a \u201csymbol against majoritarianism\u201d.\n\nHe extensively analysed Article 110 of the Indian Constitution and emphasized that any bill within the ambit of Article 110 must contain \u201conly provisions\u201d dealing with the matter specified therein. Laying emphasis on the use of the words \u201cif\u201d and \u201conly\u201d within the provision, he cautioned that judges \u201ccannot rewrite the Constitution, particularly where it is contrary to both text, context and intent.\u201d He noted that to allow bills that traverse outside the scope of Article 110 to be passed as money Bills would have \u201cconsequences in terms of the nature of the Bill and the legislative participation of the Rajya Sabha,\u201d and \u201creduce bicameralism to an illusion.\u201d He held:<blockquote>A Bill, to be a Money Bill, must contain only provisions which fall within the ambit of the matters mentioned in Article 110\u2026The Lok Sabha cannot introduce and pass a legislative measure in the garb of a Money Bill, which could otherwise have been amended or rejected by the Rajya Sabha. Bicameralism is a founding value of our democracy. It is a part of the basic structure of the Constitution. Introduction and passing of a Bill as a Money Bill, which does not qualify to be a Money Bill under Article 110(1) of the Constitution, is plainly unconstitutional\u2026 Introducing the Aadhaar Act as a Money Bill has bypassed the constitutional authority of the Rajya Sabha. The passage of the Aadhaar Act as a Money Bill is an abuse of the constitutional process. It deprived the Rajya Sabha from altering the provisions of the Bill by carrying out amendments.. Superseding the authority of the Rajya Sabha is in conflict with the constitutional scheme and the legitimacy of democratic institutions. It constitutes a fraud on the Constitution\u2026 This debasement of a democratic institution cannot be allowed to pass. Institutions are crucial to democracy. Debasing them can only cause a peril to democratic structures.<ref name=\":15\" /></blockquote>One academician wrote shortly thereafter that Justice Chandrachud\u2019s reading of the constitutional provision and assessment of the Aadhaar Act upheld \u201cthe delicate balance of bicameralism\u201d which lies at the heart of India\u2019s parliamentary democracy\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://indconlawphil.wordpress.com/2018/10/01/the-aadhaar-judgment-and-the-constitution-iii-on-the-money-bill-guest-post/|title=The Aadhaar Judgment and the Constitution \u2013 III: On the Money Bill (Guest Post)|last=Bhatia|first=Gautam|date=2018-10-01|website=Indian Constitutional Law and Philosophy|language=en|access-date=2020-04-21}}</ref>\n\n==== ''Individual, State and Identity'' ====\nJustice Chandrachud\u2019s judgment also analysed the intersection between identity and individuals. The dissent was noted for the emphasis on the protection of individual identity. Emphasising on the plurality of identities of an individual, he observed that:<blockquote>Technologically, at this level, Aadhaar was to be a means of identification. Yet at another level, the Aadhaar project also offered itself as providing a documentary identity to persons who may not have possessed one at all... Identity includes the right to determine the forms through which identity is expressed and the right not to be identified. That concept is now \u201cflipped\u201d so that identification through identifiers becomes the only form of identity in the time of database governance. This involves a radical transformation in the position of the individual\u2026Identity is a plural concept. The Constitution also recognizes a multitude of identities through the plethora of rights that it safeguards. The technology deployed in the Aadhaar scheme reduces different constitutional identities into a single identity of a 12-digit number and infringes the right if an individual to identify himself/herself through a chosen means. Aadhaar is about identification and is an instrument which facilitates a prof of identity. It must not be allowed to obliterate constitutional identity.</blockquote>He analysed the intersection between law and technology and observed that the biometric technology \u201cwhich is the core of the Aadhaar programme is probabilistic in nature, leading to authentication failures.\u201d He observed that:<blockquote>Dignity and the rights of individuals cannot be made to depend on algorithms or probabilities. Constitutional guarantees cannot be subject to the vicissitudes of technology.</blockquote>\n\n==== Aftermath of the Dissent ====\nJustice Chandrachud\u2019s dissent has received academic analysis<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nationalheraldindia.com/india/aadhaar-verdict-justice-dy-chandrachud-hailed-for-historic-dissent|title=Justice DY Chandrachud\u2019s \u2018historic dissent\u2019 on Aadhaar verdict hailed|website=National Herald|language=en|access-date=2020-04-21}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://livewire.thewire.in/politics/chandrachud-dissent-aadhaar/|title=How Justice Chandrachud's Aadhaar Dissent Upholds the Spirit of the Indian Constitution|last=Tweet|last2=WhatsApp|date=2018-09-28|website=Live Wire|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-21}}</ref> and has led some scholars to write that the dissent ranks alongside the great dissents in the history of the Indian Supreme Court.

His Lordship had a clear-eyed view of the dangers of a state or anyone having control over one\u2019s personal information and generally, I preferred his approach to the issue over that of the other judges\u2026 I must also say that in the application of the standard I prefer the reasoning of Dr Chandrachud J to that of the majority.</blockquote>One constitutional law expert observed<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://indconlawphil.wordpress.com/2019/04/13/the-afterlife-of-the-aadhaar-dissent-the-jamaican-supreme-court-strikes-down-a-national-biometric-identification-system/|title=The Afterlife of the Aadhaar Dissent: The Jamaican Supreme Court Strikes Down a National Biometric Identification System|last=Bhatia|first=Gautam|date=2019-04-13|website=Indian Constitutional Law and Philosophy|language=en|access-date=2020-04-21}}</ref> that:<blockquote>\u2026a dissent is not limited to a footnote in the judicial lore of a nation, waiting for the years to pass by until the \u201cintelligence of a future day\u201d dawns.

Noting deficiencies in the reasoning of the majority in the Aadhaar judgment and referring the question of law on Money Bills to a Bench of a higher strength, he stated:<blockquote>Upon an extensive examination of the matter, we notice that the majority in K.S. Puttaswamy (Aadhaar-5) pronounced the nature of the impugned enactment without first delineating the scope of Article 110(1) and principles for interpretation or the repercussions of such process. It is clear to us that the majority dictum in K.S.

He stated:<blockquote>\u2026the employment of state machinery to curb dissent instils fear and creates a chilling atmosphere on free speech which violates the rule of law and detracts from the constitutional vision of a pluralist society\u2026The true test of a democracy is its ability to ensure the creation and protection of spaces where every individual can voice their opinion without the fear of retribution\u2026A state committed to the rule of law ensures that the state apparatus is not employed to curb legitimate and peaceful protest but to create spaces conducive for deliberation. Within the bounds of law, liberal democracies ensure that their citizens enjoy the right to express their views in every conceivable manner, including the right to protest and express dissent against prevailing laws. The blanket labelling of such dissent as \u2018anti-national\u2019 or \u2018anti-democratic\u2019 strikes at the heart of our commitment to the protection of constitutional values and the promotion of a deliberative democracy.</blockquote>In an impassioned appeal to pluralism and the celebration of diversity, he stated:<blockquote>The framers of the Constitution rejected the notion of a Hindu India and a Muslim India. They recognised only the Republic of India\u2026A united India is not one characterized by a single identity devoid of its rich plurality, both of cultures and of values. National unity denotes a shared culture of values and a commitment to the fundamental ideals of the Constitution in which all individuals are guaranteed not just the fundamental rights but also conditions for their free and safe exercise. Pluralism depicts not merely a commitment to the preservation of diversity, but a commitment to the fundamental postulates of individual and equal dignity. In this sense, pluralism furthers the basic postulates of the Constitution and nourishes and provides content to the goal of national unity...No single individual or institution can claim a monopoly over the idea of India\u2026what is of utmost relevance today is our ability and commitment to preserve, conserve and build on the rich pluralistic history we have inherited.</blockquote>The speech was reported <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.indialegallive.com/top-news-of-the-day/news/dissent-not-anti-national-says-justice-dy-chandrachud-89239|title=Dissent Not Anti-National excerpts/ Justice PD Desai Memorial Lecture 2020|last=Legal|first=India|date=2020-02-22|website=India Legal|language=en-US|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.outlookindia.com/newsscroll/blanket-labelling-of-dissent-as-antinational-hurts-ethos-of/1735088|title=Blanket labelling of dissent as anti-national hurts ethos of|website=https://www.outlookindia.com/|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://punemirror.indiatimes.com/news/india/dissent-a-safety-valve-justice-chandrachud/articleshow/74156371.cms|title=Dissent a safety valve: Justice Chandrachud|last=Feb 16|first=PTI {{!}} Updated:|last2=2020|website=Pune Mirror|language=en|access-date=2020-04-20|last3=Ist|first3=08:07}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.livelaw.in/top-stories/hindu-india-and-a-muslim-indiajustice-chandrachud-152796|title='The Framers of Constitution Rejected The Notion of a Hindu India And a Muslim India':Justice Chandrachud [Read Full Text Of Speech]|last=NETWORK|first=LIVELAW NEWS|date=2020-02-16|website=www.livelaw.in|language=en|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref> as a plea to protect the right to dissent in a free and democratic society.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070806180624/http://www.vmslaw.edu/sympo.htm Millennium laws For India Inc.---A symposium]\n* [http://lawcommissionofindia.nic.in/adr_conf/chandrachud3.pdf M E D I A T I O N \u2013 realizing the potential and designing. implementation strategies.]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070928170649/http://www.humanrightsinitiative.org/jc/papers/jc_2002/judges_papers/chandrachud_final.pdf First South Asian Regional Judicial Colloquium on Access to Justice]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070820184647/http://www.humanrightsinitiative.org/jc/papers/jc_2003/background_papers.htm CHRI: Judicial Colloquia Series on Access to Justice]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070702192624/http://www.interights.org/page.php?dir=News Justiciability of Economic, Social and Cultural Rights in the Pacific\u2014A judicial colloquium and workshop]\n* [http://www.allahabadhighcourt.in/service/judgeDetail.jsp?id=203|High Court of Judicature at Allahabad]\n\n{{Sitting Judges of the Supreme Court of India}}\n\n{{authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Chandrachud, Dhananjaya Y.}}\n[[Category:20th-century Indian judges]]\n[[Category:1959 births]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:Faculty of Law, University of Delhi alumni]]\n[[Category:Harvard Law School alumni]]\n[[Category:Indian solicitors]]\n[[Category:Judges of the Mumbai High Court]]\n[[Category:St. Columba's School, Delhi alumni]]\n[[Category:Chief Justices of the Allahabad High Court]]\n[[Category:Justices of the Supreme Court of India]]\n[[Category:21st-century Indian judges]]\n", "name_user": "Charmanderrulez", "label": "safe", "comment": "Minor grammatical changes in intro paragraphs", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhananjaya_Y._Chandrachud"}

Primary education commonly starts at four to five years old. Children typically enroll in a Junior Infant class at age four or five depending on parental wishes. Some schools enrollment policies have age four by a specific date minimum age requirements.\n\n====Pre-school====\n\nMost play schools in Ireland are in the private sector. Increasingly, children of working parents, who are below school age; attend a myriad of cr\u00e8ches, play-schools, Montessori schools, etc., which have sprung up in response to the changing needs of modern families. These operate as businesses and may charge often substantial childcare fees. Since 2009, in response to public demand for affordable childcare, children may receive two years free preschool the years prior to starting primary schools under the \"Early Childcare and Education Scheme\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/pre_school_education_and_childcare/early_childhood_care_and_education_scheme.html|title=Early Childhood Care and Education Scheme|first=|last=Citizensinformation.ie|website=citizensinformation.ie}}</ref>\n\nIrish language [[Na\u00edonra]]\u00ed are growing rapidly across Ireland.

The Leaving Certificate examinations take place directly after the end of Sixth Year, with the first exam being held on the Wednesday following the June public holiday (the first Monday in June).\n*Fifth Year (age 16\u201318 or age 15\u201317 if Transition Year is skipped)\n*Sixth Year (age 17\u201319 or age 16\u201318 if Transition Year is skipped)\n\nTo prepare students for the State examination in both the Senior (Leaving Certificate) and Junior (Junior Certificate) cycles, many schools hold Mock Examinations (also known as Pre-Certificate Examinations) around February each year. These \"mocks\" are not state examinations: independent companies provide the exam papers and marking schemes&nbsp;\u2013 and are therefore not mandatory across all schools.\n\n==Primary education==\nThe Primary School Curriculum (1999) is taught in all schools. The document is prepared by the [[National Council for Curriculum and Assessment]] and leaves to the church authorities (usually the [[Catholic Church]] but not universally) the formulation and implementation of the religious curriculum in the schools they control. The curriculum seeks to celebrate the uniqueness of the child:<ref>Chapter 1, [http://www.ncca.ie/eng/index.asp?docID=120 Primary School Curriculum] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070210233746/http://www.ncca.ie/eng/index.asp?docID=120 |date=10 February 2007 }}, NCCA, 1999</ref>\n\n:''...as it is expressed in each child's personality, intelligence and potential for development. It is designed to nurture the child in all dimensions of his or her life\u2014spiritual, moral, cognitive, emotional, imaginative, aesthetic, social and physical...''\n\nThe Primary Certificate Examination (1929\u20131967) was the terminal examination at this level until the first primary-school curriculum, ''Curaclam na Bunscoile'' (1971), was introduced, though informal standardised tests are still performed. The primary school system consists of eight years: Junior and Senior Infants, and First to Sixth Classes. Most children attend primary school between the ages of four and twelve although it is not compulsory until the age of six. A minority of children start school at three.\n\nVirtually all state-funded primary schools \u2014 almost 97 percent \u2014 are under church control. Irish law allows schools under church control to consider religion the main factor in admissions. Oversubscribed schools often choose to admit Catholics over non-Catholics, a situation that has created difficulty for non-Catholic families. The United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child in Geneva asked [[James Reilly (Irish politician)|James Reilly]], the [[Minister for Children and Youth Affairs|Minister for Children]] at that time, to explain the continuation of preferential access to state-funded schools on the basis of religion. He said that the laws probably needed to change, but noted it may take a referendum because the Irish constitution gives protections to religious institutions. The issue is most problematic in the Dublin area. A petition initiated by a Dublin attorney, Paddy Monahan, has received almost 20,000 signatures in favour of overturning the preference given to Catholic children. A recently formed advocacy group, Education Equality, is planning a legal challenge.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/22/world/europe/ireland-catholic-baptism-school.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&clickSource=story-heading&module=second-column-region&region=top-news&WT.nav=top-news Catholic Church\u2019s Hold on Schools at Issue in Changing Ireland] The New York Times, 21 January 2016</ref>\n\n===Types of school===\nPrimary education is generally completed at a [[National school (Ireland)|national school]], a [[multidenominational school]], a [[gaelscoil]] or a [[Preparatory school (UK)|preparatory school]].\n*[[National school (Ireland)|National school]]s date back to the introduction of state primary education in 1831.

The Irish language is the working language in these schools and they can now be found countrywide in English-speaking communities. They differ from Irish-language national schools in Irish-speaking regions in that most are under the patronage of a voluntary organisation, ''[[An Foras P\u00e1tr\u00fanachta na Scoileanna L\u00e1nGhaeilge Teo|Foras P\u00e1tr\u00fanachta na Scoileanna L\u00e1n-Ghaeilge]]'', rather than a diocesan patronage.<ref name=\"citizensinformation-ownership-primary-schools\"/> Approximately 6% of primary school children attend Gaelscoils and approximately 3% attend Gaelchol\u00e1ist\u00ed with 187 primary and post-primary schools across the country making it the fastest growing education sector.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}\n*[[Multidenominational school]]s are another innovation.

Most students attend and complete secondary education, with approximately 90% of school-leavers taking the terminal [[Test (assessment)|examination]], the [[Leaving Certificate Examination|Leaving Certificate]], at age 16\u201319 (in 6th Year at secondary school). Secondary education is generally completed at one of four types of school:<ref name=\"citizensinformation-types-secondary\">{{cite web\n| title = Choosing a post-primary school\n| publisher = [[Citizens Information Board]]\n| url = https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/primary_and_post_primary_education/going_to_post_primary_school/types_of_post_primary_school.html\n| accessdate = \n| date = 30 July 2018 \n}}</ref><ref name=\"Unesco\">{{cite web\n| title = Education Provision in Ireland\n| publisher = UNESCO International Board of Education | year = 2001\n| url = http://www.ibe.unesco.org/International/ICE/natrap/Ireland.pdf\n| accessdate = 7 September 2009\n}}</ref>\n* [[Voluntary secondary school]]s, or just \"secondary schools\", are owned and managed by religious communities or private organisations. The state funds 90% of teachers' salaries. With respect to other running costs, the vast majority of schools have 95% covered by the state with the balance being made up largely through voluntary contributions from pupils' families, while a minority of schools charge fees for pupils to attend and do not receive state subvention other than teachers' salaries. These schools cater for 57% of secondary pupils.\n* [[Vocational school]]s are owned and managed by [[Education and Training Board]]s, with 93% of their costs met by the state. These schools educate 28% of secondary pupils.\n* [[Comprehensive school]]s or [[Community school (Ireland)|community school]]s were established in the 1960s, often by amalgamating voluntary secondary and vocational schools. They are fully funded by the state and run by local boards of management. Nearly 15% of secondary pupils attend such schools.\n*[[Grinds|Grind schools]] are fee-paying privately run schools outside the state sector, who tend to run only the Senior Cycle curriculum for 5th and 6th Year students as well as a one-year repeat Leaving Certificate programme.\n\n[[Gaelchol\u00e1iste|Gaelchol\u00e1ist\u00ed]] are second-level schools (voluntary, vocational or comprehensive) located within English-speaking communities but in which the [[Irish language]] is used as the main medium of education. Approximately 3% of secondary students attend these schools.\n\nIn urban areas, there is considerable freedom in choosing the type of school the child will attend. The emphasis of the education system at second level is as much on breadth as on depth; the system attempts to prepare the individual for society and further education or work. This is similar to the [[Education in Scotland|education system in Scotland]]. Although in 2012, the [[Programme for International Student Assessment]] (Pisa) found Ireland to be 7th in reading and 20th in mathematics in a world survey at the age of 15.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-26249042|title=Pisa tests: Top 40 for maths and reading|date=2015-10-14|newspaper=BBC News|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-11-30}}</ref>\n\n=== Types of programme ===\nThe document ''Rules and Programme for Secondary Schools'' published by the Department of Education and Skills sets out the minimum standards of education required at this level. Examinations are overseen by the [[State Examinations Commission]]. Additional documents set out the standard in each element, module or subject.\n\n* The '''Junior Cycle''' builds on the education received at primary level and culminates with the [[Junior Certificate|Junior Certificate Examination]]. Students usually begin this at the age of 12 or 13. The Junior Certificate Examination is taken after three years of study and not before fourteen years of age. It consists of exams in English, Irish, Maths and Science (unless the student has an exemption in one of these) as well as a number of chosen subjects. This is typically a selection of subjects including Art, German, French, Spanish, Italian, Latin, Ancient Greek and Classical Studies, Music, Business Studies, Technology, Home Economics, Materials Technology (Woodwork, Metalwork), History, Geography, Civic Social and Political Education (CSPE), and Religious Education. The selection of optional and compulsory subjects varies from school to school.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.examinations.ie/index.php?l=en&mc=ca&sc=sc|title=State Examination Commission - Candidates|first=Ecom|last=Ireland|website=examinations.ie}}</ref> Most students take around ten examined subjects altogether. Other non-examined classes at Junior Cycle level include Physical Education and Social Personal and Health Education (SPHE).\n* '''[[Transition Year]]''' is a one-year informal course taken by an increasing number of students usually ages 15 or 16. The content of this is left to the school to model on the local needs. It is compulsory in some schools but optional in others. Some schools do not offer it. Students may attend structured classes, but do not cover material relevant to the Senior Cycle or the Leaving Certificate exams, and therefore students who choose not to do this year are in no way academically disadvantaged when entering the Senior Cycle. The range of activities in Transition Year or Fourth Year differs greatly from school to school, but many include activities such as work experience placements, project work, international trips or exchanges and excursions. Students may participate in courses such as creative writing, sailing, film-making, public speaking and so on, or enter competitions in science, fashion, motor sport and others that would normally be too time-consuming for a full-time student. Proponents{{who|date=March 2017}} of TY believe that it allows students an extra year to mature, engage in self-directed learning, explore career options and to choose subjects for senior cycle (the results of the Junior Certificate examination do not become available until midway through September, by which time students not taking Transition Year will already have chosen their classes and begun attending). Opponents believe that a year away from traditional study and the classroom environment can distract students and cause problems when they return to the Senior Cycle. They also believe that the activities undertaken in TY prevent some students from enrolling in this year, as they can be costly and most schools charge a fee of a few hundred euro to cover these activities.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n* The '''Senior Cycle''' builds on the junior cycle and culminates with the [[Irish Leaving Certificate|Leaving Certificate Examination]]. Students normally begin this aged 15\u201317 the year following the completion of the Junior Cycle or Transition Year. The Leaving Certificate Examination is taken after two years of study usually at the ages of 17-19.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nTherefore, a typical secondary school will consist of First to Third Year (with the Junior Certificate at the end of Third), the usually optional Transition Year (though compulsory in some schools), and Fifth and Sixth Year (with the Leaving Cert. at the end of Sixth).\n\nThe vast majority of students continue from lower level to senior level, with only 12.3% leaving after the Junior Certificate.

These \"mocks\" are not state examinations: independent companies provide the exam papers and marking schemes&nbsp;\u2013 and are therefore not mandatory across all schools.\n\n==Primary education==\nThe Primary School Curriculum (1999) is taught in all schools. The document is prepared by the [[National Council for Curriculum and Assessment]] and leaves to the church authorities (usually the [[Catholic Church]] but not universally) the formulation and implementation of the religious curriculum in the schools they control. The curriculum seeks to celebrate the uniqueness of the child:<ref>Chapter 1, [http://www.ncca.ie/eng/index.asp?docID=120 Primary School Curriculum] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070210233746/http://www.ncca.ie/eng/index.asp?docID=120 |date=10 February 2007 }}, NCCA, 1999</ref>\n\n:''...as it is expressed in each child's personality, intelligence and potential for development. It is designed to nurture the child in all dimensions of his or her life\u2014spiritual, moral, cognitive, emotional, imaginative, aesthetic, social and physical...''\n\nThe Primary Certificate Examination (1929\u20131967) was the terminal examination at this level until the first primary-school curriculum, ''Curaclam na Bunscoile'' (1971), was introduced, though informal standardised tests are still performed. The primary school system consists of eight years: Junior and Senior Infants, and First to Sixth Classes. Most children attend primary school between the ages of four and twelve although it is not compulsory until the age of six. A minority of children start school at three.\n\nVirtually all state-funded primary schools \u2014 almost 97 percent \u2014 are under church control. Irish law allows schools under church control to consider religion the main factor in admissions. Oversubscribed schools often choose to admit Catholics over non-Catholics, a situation that has created difficulty for non-Catholic families. The United Nations Committee on the Rights of the Child in Geneva asked [[James Reilly (Irish politician)|James Reilly]], the [[Minister for Children and Youth Affairs|Minister for Children]] at that time, to explain the continuation of preferential access to state-funded schools on the basis of religion. He said that the laws probably needed to change, but noted it may take a referendum because the Irish constitution gives protections to religious institutions. The issue is most problematic in the Dublin area. A petition initiated by a Dublin attorney, Paddy Monahan, has received almost 20,000 signatures in favour of overturning the preference given to Catholic children. A recently formed advocacy group, Education Equality, is planning a legal challenge.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/22/world/europe/ireland-catholic-baptism-school.html?hp&action=click&pgtype=Homepage&clickSource=story-heading&module=second-column-region&region=top-news&WT.nav=top-news Catholic Church\u2019s Hold on Schools at Issue in Changing Ireland] The New York Times, 21 January 2016</ref>\n\n===Types of school===\nPrimary education is generally completed at a [[National school (Ireland)|national school]], a [[multidenominational school]], a [[gaelscoil]] or a [[Preparatory school (UK)|preparatory school]].\n*[[National school (Ireland)|National school]]s date back to the introduction of state primary education in 1831.

The Irish language is the working language in these schools and they can now be found countrywide in English-speaking communities. They differ from Irish-language national schools in Irish-speaking regions in that most are under the patronage of a voluntary organisation, ''[[An Foras P\u00e1tr\u00fanachta na Scoileanna L\u00e1nGhaeilge Teo|Foras P\u00e1tr\u00fanachta na Scoileanna L\u00e1n-Ghaeilge]]'', rather than a diocesan patronage.<ref name=\"citizensinformation-ownership-primary-schools\"/> Approximately 6% of primary school children attend Gaelscoils and approximately 3% attend Gaelchol\u00e1ist\u00ed with 187 primary and post-primary schools across the country making it the fastest growing education sector.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}\n*[[Multidenominational school]]s are another innovation.

Most students attend and complete secondary education, with approximately 90% of school-leavers taking the terminal [[Test (assessment)|examination]], the [[Leaving Certificate Examination|Leaving Certificate]], at age 16\u201319 (in 6th Year at secondary school). Secondary education is generally completed at one of four types of school:<ref name=\"citizensinformation-types-secondary\">{{cite web\n| title = Choosing a post-primary school\n| publisher = [[ Citizens Information Board]]\n| url = https://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/education/primary_and_post_primary_education/going_to_post_primary_school/types_of_post_primary_school.html\n| accessdate = \n| date = 30 July 2018 \n}}</ref><ref name=\"Unesco\">{{cite web\n| title = Education Provision in Ireland\n| publisher = UNESCO International Board of Education | year = 2001\n| url = http://www.ibe.unesco.org/International/ICE/natrap/Ireland.pdf\n| accessdate = 7 September 2009\n}}</ref>\n* [[Voluntary secondary school]]s, or just \"secondary schools\", are owned and managed by religious communities or private organisations. The state funds 90% of teachers' salaries. With respect to other running costs, the vast majority of schools have 95% covered by the state with the balance being made up largely through voluntary contributions from pupils' families, while a minority of schools charge fees for pupils to attend and do not receive state subvention other than teachers' salaries. These schools cater for 57% of secondary pupils.\n* [[Vocational school]]s are owned and managed by [[Education and Training Board]]s, with 93% of their costs met by the state. These schools educate 28% of secondary pupils.\n* [[Comprehensive school]]s or [[Community school (Ireland)|community school]]s were established in the 1960s, often by amalgamating voluntary secondary and vocational schools. They are fully funded by the state and run by local boards of management. Nearly 15% of secondary pupils attend such schools.\n*[[Grinds|Grind schools]] are fee-paying privately run schools outside the state sector, who tend to run only the Senior Cycle curriculum for 5th and 6th Year students as well as a one-year repeat Leaving Certificate programme.\n\n[[Gaelchol\u00e1iste|Gaelchol\u00e1ist\u00ed]] are second-level schools (voluntary, vocational or comprehensive) located within English-speaking communities but in which the [[Irish language]] is used as the main medium of education. Approximately 3% of secondary students attend these schools.\n\nIn urban areas, there is considerable freedom in choosing the type of school the child will attend. The emphasis of the education system at second level is as much on breadth as on depth; the system attempts to prepare the individual for society and further education or work. This is similar to the [[Education in Scotland|education system in Scotland]]. Although in 2012, the [[Programme for International Student Assessment]] (Pisa) found Ireland to be 7th in reading and 20th in mathematics in a world survey at the age of 15.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-26249042|title=Pisa tests: Top 40 for maths and reading|date=2015-10-14|newspaper=BBC News|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-11-30}}</ref>\n\n=== Types of programme ===\nThe document ''Rules and Programme for Secondary Schools'' published by the Department of Education and Skills sets out the minimum standards of education required at this level. Examinations are overseen by the [[State Examinations Commission]]. Additional documents set out the standard in each element, module or subject.\n\n* The '''Junior Cycle''' builds on the education received at primary level and culminates with the [[Junior Certificate|Junior Certificate Examination]]. Students usually begin this at the age of 12 or 13. The Junior Certificate Examination is taken after three years of study and not before fourteen years of age. It consists of exams in English, Irish, Maths and Science (unless the student has an exemption in one of these) as well as a number of chosen subjects. This is typically a selection of subjects including Art, German, French, Spanish, Italian, Latin, Ancient Greek and Classical Studies, Music, Business Studies, Technology, Home Economics, Materials Technology (Woodwork, Metalwork), History, Geography, Civic Social and Political Education (CSPE), and Religious Education. The selection of optional and compulsory subjects varies from school to school.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.examinations.ie/index.php?l=en&mc=ca&sc=sc|title=State Examination Commission - Candidates|first=Ecom|last=Ireland|website=examinations.ie}}</ref> Most students take around ten examined subjects altogether. Other non-examined classes at Junior Cycle level include Physical Education and Social Personal and Health Education (SPHE).\n* '''[[Transition Year]]''' is a one-year informal course taken by an increasing number of students usually ages 15 or 16. The content of this is left to the school to model on the local needs. It is compulsory in some schools but optional in others. Some schools do not offer it. Students may attend structured classes, but do not cover material relevant to the Senior Cycle or the Leaving Certificate exams, and therefore students who choose not to do this year are in no way academically disadvantaged when entering the Senior Cycle. The range of activities in Transition Year or Fourth Year differs greatly from school to school, but many include activities such as work experience placements, project work, international trips or exchanges and excursions. Students may participate in courses such as creative writing, sailing, film-making, public speaking and so on, or enter competitions in science, fashion, motor sport and others that would normally be too time-consuming for a full-time student. Proponents{{who|date=March 2017}} of TY believe that it allows students an extra year to mature, engage in self-directed learning, explore career options and to choose subjects for senior cycle (the results of the Junior Certificate examination do not become available until midway through September, by which time students not taking Transition Year will already have chosen their classes and begun attending). Opponents believe that a year away from traditional study and the classroom environment can distract students and cause problems when they return to the Senior Cycle. They also believe that the activities undertaken in TY prevent some students from enrolling in this year, as they can be costly and most schools charge a fee of a few hundred euro to cover these activities.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n* The '''Senior Cycle''' builds on the junior cycle and culminates with the [[Irish Leaving Certificate|Leaving Certificate Examination]]. Students normally begin this aged 15\u201317 the year following the completion of the Junior Cycle or Transition Year. The Leaving Certificate Examination is taken after two years of study usually at the ages of 17-19.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}\n\nTherefore, a typical secondary school will consist of First to Third Year (with the Junior Certificate at the end of Third), the usually optional Transition Year (though compulsory in some schools), and Fifth and Sixth Year (with the Leaving Cert. at the end of Sixth).\n\nThe vast majority of students continue from lower level to senior level, with only 12.3% leaving after the Junior Certificate. This is lower than the EU average of 15.2%.<ref name=\"Measuring Ireland's Progress - 2007\">{{cite web|url=http://www.cso.ie/releasespublications/documents/other_releases/2007/progress2007/measuringirelandsprogress.pdf|title=Server Error 404 - CSO - Central Statistics Office|website=cso.ie}}</ref>\n\nIreland's secondary students rank above average in terms of academic performance in both the OECD and EU; having reading literacy, mathematical literacy and [[scientific literacy]] test scores better than average.
