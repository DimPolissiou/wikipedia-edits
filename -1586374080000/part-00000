He became a wealthy, well-connected lawyer, state prosecutor, Wilmington city attorney, legal counsel to Governor [[Mike Castle]], and political consultant, well known in Delaware's political community. In 1994, Capano was a partner at the Wilmington office of [[Saul Ewing Arnstein & Lehr|Saul Ewing LLP]] when he became involved with 28-year-old Anne Marie Fahey, the appointments secretary to then-Governor [[Tom Carper]]. Married with four daughters, Thomas Capano separated from his wife Kay the following year.<ref>''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, November 24, 1997. p. 25</ref>\n\n==Fahey's disappearance and investigation==\nAnne Marie Fahey, the scheduling secretary for Governor Carper, became involved with the married Capano in 1994. In September 1995, while still involved with Capano, Fahey began another relationship with Michael Scanlan.<ref name=\"trial\" />\n\nShe was last seen alive on Thursday, June 27, 1996, when she went to dinner with Capano in Philadelphia.  Fahey's family reported her missing on June 30, 1996. After an extensive investigation into her disappearance, the FBI joined in the investigation in July 1996, and a federal grand jury heard evidence for over a year.<ref name=\"trial\">Capano v. State, 781 A.2d 556, 582, 2001 WL 980939 (Del. 2001).</ref> Capano, the last known person to have seen her alive, was the primary suspect.  Capano was arrested for her murder in November 1997, over sixteen months after her disappearance. However, Fahey's body was never found, and prosecutors were unable to establish the cause or manner of Fahey's death.\n\nProsecutors alleged that Capano murdered Fahey at the house he rented and, with the assistance of his brother, Gerry, dumped her body in the [[Atlantic Ocean]]. Gerry Capano owned a boat and, when it was sold, its two [[anchor]]s were missing.  On November 8, 1997, Gerry was interviewed by detectives and told them that Thomas had borrowed the boat and admitted that he had murdered someone who was attempting to extort him. They went to [[Stone Harbor, New Jersey]], with a large cooler that contained Fahey's body{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}, sailed {{convert|62|mi|km}} out to sea, and pushed the cooler overboard. Gerry told police that Thomas shot the cooler in order to sink it, but that the cooler remained afloat in the water. Thomas then retrieved the cooler, removed the body, and wrapped the anchor chains around it. Thomas also asked Gerry to help dispose of a blood-stained sofa and carpet into a dumpster, which was managed by a third brother, Louis.  Thomas instructed Louis to empty the dumpsters outside of their regular schedule. The empty cooler was found on July 4, 1996, by a local fisherman.<ref>Meyer, Peter.

On January 17, 1999, the jury convicted Capano of first-degree murder and he was sentenced to death by lethal injection.\n\nIn January 2006, the [[Delaware Supreme Court]] affirmed Capano's conviction but remanded the case for sentencing because the death penalty was imposed by a non-unanimous jury verdict.

at the ''[[2012 Summer Olympics]]'' in [[London]], from 27 July to 12 August 2012. This was the nation's twenty-fourth appearance at the Summer Olympics; Norway did not take part in the [[1904 Summer Olympics]] in St. Louis and the [[1980 Summer Olympics]] in Moscow, due to the country's support for the [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|United States boycott]]. The [[Norwegian Olympic and Paralympic Committee and Confederation of Sports]] sent a total of 66 athletes to the Games, 34 men and 32 women, to compete in 14 sports. [[Handball at the 2012 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's tournament|Women's handball]] was the only team-based sport in which Norway was represented in these Olympic games. There was only a single competitor in badminton, mountain biking, diving, equestrian dressage, fencing and wrestling.\n\nThe Norwegian team featured past Olympic champions, three of them defending (javelin thrower [[Andreas Thorkildsen]], single sculls rower [[Olaf Tufte]], who competed at his fifth Olympics, and the women's national handball team, led by [[G\u00f8ril Snorroeggen]]). Archer [[B\u00e5rd Nesteng]] made his Olympic comeback in London after a twelve-year absence. Other notable Norwegian athletes featured Gambian-born sprinter [[Jaysuma Saidy Ndure]], who finished fourth in the world championships, breaststroke swimmer [[Sara Nordenstam]], who previously won bronze in Beijing, and sprint kayaker [[Mira Ver\u00e5s Larsen]], who was the nation's flag bearer at the opening ceremony.\n\nNorway left London with a total of 4 medals (2 gold, 1 silver, and 1 bronze), the lowest haul since [[1984 Summer Olympics|Los Angeles]]. Among the nation's medalists were [[Eirik Ver\u00e5s Larsen]], who recaptured his gold medal from [[2004 Summer Olympics|Athens]] in men's sprint kayaking,<ref>{{cite news|title=\u2018Kayak king\u2019 paddled to gold|url=http://www.newsinenglish.no/2012/08/08/kayak-king-paddled-his-way-to-gold/|publisher=Views and News from Norway|date=8 August 2012|accessdate=10 September 2012}}</ref> and [[Bartosz Piasecki]], who won Norway's first ever Olympic medal in fencing. The women's national handball team managed to defend its Olympic title from Beijing, after beating [[Montenegro women's national handball team|Montenegro]] in the final. Several Norwegian athletes, however, narrowly missed out of the medal standings, including defending champions Thorklidsen and Tufte, and middle-distance runner [[Henrik Ingebrigtsen]].\n\n==Medalists==\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size: 95%;\"\n|-\n!

The second Angevin Hungarian king, [[Louis I of Hungary|Louis the Great]] (1342\u20131382), led many successful military campaigns from Lithuania to Southern Italy (Kingdom of Naples), and was also [[King of Poland]] from 1370. After King Louis died without a male heir, the country was stabilized only when [[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|Sigismund of Luxembourg]] (1387\u20131437) succeeded to the throne, who in 1433 also became [[Holy Roman Emperor]].

During the rule of K\u00e1rolyi's pacifist cabinet, Hungary lost the control over approx. 75% of its former pre-WW1 territories (325 411&nbsp;km\u00b2) without fight and was subject to foreign occupation. The [[Little Entente]], sensing an opportunity, invaded the country from three sides\u2014Romania [[Hungarian-Romanian War|invaded]] [[Transylvania]], Czechoslovakia annexed [[Upper Hungary]] (today's Slovakia), and a joint [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serb]]-[[French Army|French]] coalition annexed [[Vojvodina]] and other southern regions. In March 1919, communists led by [[B\u00e9la Kun]] ousted the K\u00e1rolyi government and proclaimed the [[Hungarian Soviet Republic]] (''Tan\u00e1csk\u00f6zt\u00e1rsas\u00e1g''), followed by a thorough [[Red Terror (Hungary)|Red Terror]] campaign. Despite some successes on the Czechoslovak front, Kun's forces were ultimately unable to resist the Romanian invasion; by August 1919, Romanian troops occupied Budapest and ousted Kun.\n\n[[File:Portraits de Mikl\u00f3s Horthy.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Mikl\u00f3s Horthy]], Regent of the Kingdom of Hungary (1920\u20131944)]]\n\nIn November 1919, rightist forces led by former Austro-Hungarian admiral [[Mikl\u00f3s Horthy]] entered Budapest; exhausted by the war and its aftermath, the populace accepted Horthy's leadership. In January 1920, parliamentary elections were held and Horthy was proclaimed Regent of the reestablished [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920\u201346)|Kingdom of Hungary]], inaugurating the so-called \"Horthy era\" (''Horthy-kor''). The new government worked quickly to normalize foreign relations while turning a blind eye to a [[White Terror (Hungary)|White Terror]] that swept through the countryside; extrajudicial killings of suspected communists and Jews lasted well into 1920. On 4 June of that year, the [[Treaty of Trianon]] established new borders for Hungary.

Though free elections continued, Horthy's personality, and those of his personally selected prime ministers, dominated the political scene. The government's actions continued to drift right with the passage of antisemitic laws and, due to the continued isolation of the Little Entente, economic and then political gravitation toward [[Kingdom of Italy#Fascist regime (1922\u20131943)|Italy]] and [[Nazi Germany|Germany]]. The [[Great Depression]] further exacerbated the situation and the popularity of fascist politicians such as [[Gyula G\u00f6mb\u00f6s]] and [[Ferenc Sz\u00e1lasi]], promising economic and social recovery, rose.\n\nHorthy's nationalist agenda reached its apogee in 1938 and 1940, when the Nazis rewarded Hungary's staunchly pro-Germany foreign policy in the [[First Vienna Award|First]] and [[Second Vienna Award]]s, respectively, peacefully restoring ethnic-Hungarian-majority areas lost after Trianon.

His government's policies of militarization, industrialization, collectivization, and war compensation led to a severe decline in living standards. In imitation of Stalin's [[KGB]], the R\u00e1kosi government established a secret political police, the [[State Protection Authority|\u00c1VH]], to enforce the new regime.

The following political cooling saw the ascent of [[Imre Nagy]] to the premiership, and the growing interest of students and intellectuals in political life. Nagy promised market liberalization and political openness, while R\u00e1kosi opposed both vigorously. R\u00e1kosi eventually managed to discredit Nagy and replace him with the more hard-line [[Ern\u0151 Ger\u0151]]. Hungary joined the [[Warsaw Pact]] in May 1955, as societal dissatisfaction with the regime swelled. Following the firing on peaceful demonstrations by Soviet soldiers and secret police, and rallies throughout the country on 23 October 1956, protesters took to the streets in Budapest, initiating the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|1956 Revolution]]. In an effort to quell the chaos, Nagy returned as premier, promised free elections, and took Hungary out of the Warsaw Pact.\n\nThe violence nonetheless continued as revolutionary militias sprung up against the Soviet Army and the \u00c1VH; the roughly 3,000-strong resistance fought Soviet tanks using [[Molotov cocktail]]s and machine-pistols. Though the preponderance of the Soviets was immense, they suffered heavy losses, and by 30 October 1956 most Soviet troops had withdrawn from Budapest to garrison the countryside. For a time, the Soviet leadership was unsure how to respond to developments in Hungary, but eventually decided to intervene to prevent a destabilization of the Soviet bloc. On 4 November reinforcements of more than 150,000 troops and 2,500 tanks entered the country from the Soviet Union.<ref>Findley, Carter V., and John Rothney. ''Twentieth Century World''. sixth ed. Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 2006. 278.</ref> Nearly 20,000 Hungarians were killed resisting the intervention, while an additional 21,600 were imprisoned afterwards for political reasons. Some 13,000 were interned and 230 brought to trial and executed. Nagy was secretly tried, found guilty, sentenced to death and executed by hanging in June 1958. Because borders were briefly opened, nearly a quarter of a million people fled the country by the time the revolution was suppressed.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/6065398.stm \"Hungary's 1956 brain drain\"], BBC News, 23 October 2006</ref>\n\n==== K\u00e1d\u00e1r era 1956\u20131988 ====\n{{See also|Goulash Communism}}\n[[File:J\u00e1nos K\u00e1d\u00e1r 1962.jpg|thumb|upright|[[J\u00e1nos K\u00e1d\u00e1r]], General Secretary of MSZMP, the [[Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party]] (1956\u20131988)]]\n\nAfter a second, briefer period of Soviet military occupation, [[J\u00e1nos K\u00e1d\u00e1r]], Nagy's former Minister of State, was chosen by the Soviet leadership to head the new government and chair the new ruling [[Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party|Socialist Workers' Party]] (MSzMP). K\u00e1d\u00e1r quickly normalized the situation. In 1963, the government granted a general amnesty and released the majority of those imprisoned for their active participation in the uprising. K\u00e1d\u00e1r proclaimed a new policy line, according to which the people were no longer compelled to profess loyalty to the party if they tacitly accepted the Socialist regime as a fact of life. In many speeches, he described this as, \"Those who are not against us are with us.\" K\u00e1d\u00e1r introduced new planning priorities in the economy, such as allowing farmers significant plots of private land within the collective farm system (''h\u00e1zt\u00e1ji gazd\u00e1lkod\u00e1s''). The living standard rose as consumer good and food production took precedence over military production, which was reduced to one tenth of pre-revolutionary levels.\n\nIn 1968, the [[New Economic Mechanism]] (NEM) introduced free-market elements into socialist command economy. From the 1960s through the late 1980s, Hungary was often referred to as \"[[the happiest barrack]]\" within the [[Eastern bloc]].

Although the MSzMP began [[Hungarian Round Table Talks|Round Table Talks]] with various opposition groups in March 1989, the reburial of Imre Nagy as a revolutionary martyr that June is widely considered the symbolic end of communism in Hungary. Over 100,000 people attended the Budapest ceremony without any significant government interference, and many speakers openly called for Soviet troops to leave the country. Free elections were held [[1990 Hungarian parliamentary election|in May 1990]], and the [[Hungarian Democratic Forum]], a major conservative opposition group, was elected to the head of a coalition government. [[J\u00f3zsef Antall]] became the first democratically elected Prime Minister since World War II.\n\nWith the removal of state subsidies and rapid privatization in 1991, Hungary was affected by a severe economic recession. The Antall government's austerity measures proved unpopular, and the Communist Party's legal and political heir, the [[Hungarian Socialist Party|Socialist Party]], won the subsequent [[1994 Hungarian parliamentary election|1994 elections]]. This abrupt shift in the political landscape was repeated in [[1998 Hungarian parliamentary election|1998]] and [[2002 Hungarian parliamentary election|2002]]; each electoral cycle, the governing party was ousted and the erstwhile opposition elected. Like most other post-communist European states, however, Hungary broadly pursued an [[European integration|integrationist]] agenda, [[Enlargement of NATO|joining]] [[NATO]] in 1999 and the European Union [[2003 Hungarian European Union membership referendum|in 2004]]. As a NATO member, Hungary was involved in the [[Yugoslav Wars]].\n\nIn 2006, [[2006 protests in Hungary|major protests]] erupted after it was revealed that Prime Minister [[Ferenc Gyurcs\u00e1ny]] had claimed in [[\u0150sz\u00f6d speech|a private speech]] that [[Hungarian Socialist Party|his party]] \"lied\" to win the [[2006 Hungarian parliamentary election|recent elections]].

The Danube flows north\u2013south right through the center of contemporary Hungary, and the entire country lies within its [[drainage basin]].\n\n[[Transdanubia]], which stretches westward from the center of the country toward Austria, is a primarily hilly region with a terrain varied by low mountains. These include the very eastern stretch of the [[Alps]], ''[[Alpokalja]]'', in the west of the country, the [[Transdanubian Mountains]] in the central region of Transdanubia, and the [[Mecsek]] Mountains and [[Vill\u00e1ny Mountains]] in the south. The highest point of the area is the \u00cdrott-k\u0151 in the Alps, at {{convert|882|m|0}}. The [[Little Hungarian Plain]] (''Kisalf\u00f6ld'') is found in northern Transdanubia. [[Lake Balaton]] and [[Lake H\u00e9v\u00edz]], the largest lake in Central Europe and the largest thermal lake in the world, respectively, are in Transdanubia as well.\n\nThe ''Duna-Tisza k\u00f6ze'' and ''Tisz\u00e1nt\u00fal'' are characterized mainly by the [[Great Hungarian Plain]] (''Alf\u00f6ld''), which stretches across most of the eastern and southeastern areas of the country. To the north of the Plain are the foothills of the [[Carpathian Mountains|Carpathians]] in a wide band near the [[Slovakia]]n border.

According to popular opinion and many scientists, the country became drier in recent decades, as droughts have become quite common. Summers became hotter and winters became milder. For these reasons, snow has become much rarer than before. Popular opinion also states that the four-season system became a two-season system as spring and autumn are getting shorter and shorter, even vanishing some years. This supposed tendency unexpectedly was reversed in 2006 when Hungary's two main rivers, the [[Danube]] and the [[Tisza]], flooded at the same time.

The body is divided into county police departments which are also divided into regional and town police departments. The National Police also have subordinate agencies with nationwide jurisdiction, such as the \"Nemzeti Nyomoz\u00f3 Iroda\" (National Bureau of Investigation), a civilian police force specialised in investigating serious crimes, and the gendarmerie-like, militarised \"K\u00e9szenl\u00e9ti Rend\u0151rs\u00e9g\" (Stand-by Police) mainly dealing with riots and often reinforcing local police forces. Due to Hungary's accession to the [[Schengen Treaty]], the Police and Border Guards were merged into a single national corps, with the Border Guards becoming Police Officers.

Budapest, the capital, serves as an important hub for the [[Hungarian State Railways|Hungarian railway system]] (''M\u00c1V''). The capital is served by three large train stations called ''[[Eastern Railway Station (Budapest)|Keleti]]'' (Eastern), ''[[Western Railway Station (Budapest)|Nyugati]]'' (Western), and ''[[Southern Railway Station (Budapest)|D\u00e9li]]'' (Southern) ''p\u00e1lyaudvar''s.

The [[Budapest Metro]] is the second-oldest underground [[rapid transit|metro]] system in the world; its [[Line 1 (Budapest Metro)|Line 1]] dates from 1896. The system consists of four lines. A [[regional rail|commuter rail]] system, ''[[H\u00c9V]]'', operates in the Budapest metropolitan area.\nHungary has a total length of approximately {{convert|1314|km|2|abbr=on}} motorways ({{lang-hu|aut\u00f3p\u00e1lya}}). Motorway sections are being added to the existing network, which already connects many major economically important cities to the capital.\nThe most important port is Budapest. Other important ones include [[Duna\u00fajv\u00e1ros]] and [[Baja, Hungary|Baja]].\n\nThere are five international airports in Hungary: [[Budapest Liszt Ferenc International Airport|Budapest Liszt Ferenc]] (informally called \"Ferihegy\" after its previous name), [[Debrecen International Airport|Debrecen]], [[S\u00e1rmell\u00e9k International Airport|S\u00e1rmell\u00e9k]] (also called H\u00e9v\u00edz-Balaton Airport), [[Gy\u0151r-P\u00e9r International Airport|Gy\u0151r-P\u00e9r]], and [[P\u00e9cs-Pog\u00e1ny International Airport|P\u00e9cs-Pog\u00e1ny]].

Hungarian historiography identifies the foundation of the Hungarian state with [[Stephen I of Hungary|Stephen I's]] [[baptism]] and coronation with the [[Szentkorona|Holy Crown]] in A.D. 1000. Stephen promulgated [[Roman Catholicism]] as the state religion, and his successors were traditionally known as the [[Apostolic King]]s. The [[Catholic Church in Hungary]] remained strong through the centuries, and the [[Archbishop of Esztergom]] was granted extraordinary temporal privileges as [[prince-primate]] (''hercegpr\u00edm\u00e1s'') of Hungary. \n\nAlthough contemporary Hungary has no [[official religion]] and recognizes [[freedom of religion]] as a fundamental right, the Hungarian constitution \"recognizes Christianity's nation-building role\" in its preamble<ref>{{cite web|title=Magyarorsz\u00e1g Alapt\u00f6rv\u00e9nye|url=http://www.parlament.hu/irom39/02627/02627.pdf|website=Parlament.hu|publisher=Hungarian Parliament|accessdate=2 August 2014}}</ref> and in Article VII affirms that \"the state may cooperate with the churches for community goals.\"<ref>[https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/Hungary_2011.pdf Hungary's Constitution of 2011]</ref>\n\nDuring the initial stages of the [[Protestant Reformation]], most Hungarians took up, first, [[Lutheranism]], then [[Calvinism]] in the form of the [[Hungarian Reformed Church]]. In the second half of the 16th century, the [[Jesuits]] led a [[Counterreformation]] campaign and the population once again became predominantly Catholic. This campaign was only partially successful, however, and the (mainly Reformed) Hungarian nobility were able to secure freedom of worship for Christians. In practice this meant ''[[cuius regio, eius religio]]''; thus, most individual localities in Hungary are still identifiable as historically Catholic, Lutheran, or Reformed. The country's eastern regions, especially around [[Debrecen]] (the \"Calvinist Rome\"), remain almost completely [[Reformed]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reformatus.hu/mutat/6819/ |title=Facts and Statistics |publisher=Reformatus.hu |date=4 March 2013 |accessdate=26 March 2013}}</ref> a trait they share with historically contiguous [[Hungarians in Romania|ethnically Hungarian regions]] across the Romanian border. \n\n[[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christianity]] in Hungary is associated with the country's ethnic minorities:[[Armenians]], [[Bulgarians]], [[Greeks]], [[Romanians]], [[Rusyns]], [[Ukrainians]], and [[Serbs]].\n\nHistorically, Hungary was home to a significant Jewish community.

In contrast to Historicism, Hungarian Art Nouveau is based on the national architectural characteristics. Taking the eastern origins of the Hungarians into account, [[\u00d6d\u00f6n Lechner]] (1845\u20131914), the most important figure in Hungarian Art Nouveau, was initially inspired by Indian and Syrian architecture, and later by traditional Hungarian decorative designs. In this way, he created an original synthesis of architectural styles. By applying them to three-dimensional architectural elements, he produced a version of Art Nouveau that was specific to Hungary.\n\nTurning away from the style of Lechner, yet taking inspiration from his approach, the group of \"Young People\" (''Fiatalok''), which included [[K\u00e1roly K\u00f3s]] and Dezs\u00f6 Zrumeczky, were to use the characteristic structures and forms of traditional Hungarian architecture to achieve the same end.\n\n[[File:Museum of Applied Arts (Budapest).jpg|thumb|The [[Museum of Applied Arts (Budapest)|Museum of Applied Arts]], an [[Art Nouveau]] building designed by [[\u00d6d\u00f6n Lechner]]]]\n\nBesides the two principal styles, Budapest also displays local versions of trends originating from other European countries. The Sezession from [[Vienna]], the German [[Jugendstil]], Art Nouveau from Belgium and France, and the influence of English and Finnish architecture are all reflected in the buildings constructed at the turn of the 20th century. [[B\u00e9la Lajta]] initially adopted Lechner's style, subsequently drawing his inspiration from English and Finnish trends; after developing an interest in the [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] style, he finally arrived at modern architecture. [[Alad\u00e1r \u00c1rkay]] took almost the same route. [[Istv\u00e1n Medgyaszay]] developed his own style, which differed from Lechner's, using stylised traditional motifs to create decorative designs in concrete. In the sphere of applied arts, those chiefly responsible for promoting the spread of Art Nouveau were the School and Museum of Decorative Arts, which opened in 1896.\n\nForeigners have unexpectedly \"discovered\" that a significantly large portion of the citizens live in old and architecturally valuable buildings.

One of the greatest Hungarian composers, [[B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k]], was also among the most significant musicians of the 20th century.

Since then, however, the Hungarian music industry has begun to recover, producing successful performers in the fields of [[jazz]] such as trumpeter [[Rudolf Tomsits]], pianist-composer [[K\u00e1roly Binder]] and, in a modernized form of Hungarian folk, [[Ferenc Seb\u0151]] and [[M\u00e1rta Sebesty\u00e9n]].

Both are in Latin. These chronicles mix history with legends, so historically they are not always authentic. Another chronicle is the ''K\u00e9pes kr\u00f3nika'' (Illustrated Chronicle), which was written for [[Louis I of Hungary|Louis the Great]].\n[[File:K\u00e9pes Kr\u00f3nika 1360.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Chronicon Pictum]], a medieval illustrated chronicle from the 14th century]]\n[[Renaissance]] literature flourished under the reign of [[Matthias Corvinus of Hungary|King Matthias]] (1458\u20131490). [[Janus Pannonius]], although he wrote in Latin, counts as one of the most important persons in Hungarian literature, being the only significant Hungarian Humanist poet of the period. The first printing house was also founded during Matthias' reign, by [[Andr\u00e1s Hess]], in Buda. The first book printed in Hungary was the [[Chronica Hungarorum]].\nThe most important poets of the period was [[B\u00e1lint Balassi]] (1554\u20131594) and [[Nikola Zrinski|Mikl\u00f3s Zr\u00ednyi]] (1620\u20131664).\n\nBalassi's poetry shows medieval influences, his poems can be divided into three sections: love poems, war poems and religious poems. Zr\u00ednyi's most significant work, the epic ''[[Peril of Sziget|Szigeti veszedelem]]'' (\"Peril of Sziget\", written in 1648/49) is written in a fashion similar to the ''[[Iliad]]'', and recounts the heroic [[Battle of Szigetv\u00e1r]], where his great-grandfather died while defending the castle of Szigetv\u00e1r.\nAmong the religious literary works the most important is the Bible translation by [[G\u00e1sp\u00e1r K\u00e1roli]] (The second Hungarian Bible translation in the history), the Protestant pastor of [[G\u00f6nc]], in 1590. The translation is called the ''Bible of Vizsoly'', after the town where it was first published.

Although usually danced by young men, it can be also danced by older men. The dance is generally performed freestyle by one dancer at a time in front of a band. Women participate in the dance by standing in lines to the side, and singing or shouting verses while the men dance. Each man performs a number of points (dance phrases), typically four to eight without repetition. Each point consists of four parts, each lasting four counts. The first part is usually the same for everyone (there are only a few variations).\n\nIt was in the beginning of the 18th-century that the present style of Hungarian folk art took shape, incorporating both [[Renaissance]] and [[Baroque]] elements, depending on the area, as well as Persian [[Sassanide]] influences. Flowers and leaves, sometimes a bird or a spiral ornament, are the principal decorative themes. The most frequent ornament is a flower with a centerpiece resembling the eye of a peacock's feather.\n\nNearly all the manifestations of folk art practiced elsewhere in Europe also flourished among the [[hungarian people|Magyar]] peasantry at one time or another, their ceramics and textile being the most highly developed of all.\n\nThe finest achievements in their textile arts are the embroideries which vary from region to region. Those of [[Kalotaszeg]] in Transylvania are charming products of Oriental design, sewn chiefly in a single color&nbsp;\u2013 red, blue, or black. Soft in line, the embroideries are applied on altar cloths, pillow-cases and sheets.\n\nIn Hungary proper, S\u00e1rk\u00f6z in [[Transdanubia]] and the [[Mez\u0151k\u00f6vesd|Maty\u00f3f\u00f6ld]] in the [[Great Hungarian Plain]] produce the finest embroideries. In the [[Tolna (county)|S\u00e1rk\u00f6z]] region the women's caps show black and white designs as delicate as lace, and give evidence of the people's wonderfully subtle artistic feeling. The embroidery motifs applied to women's wear have also been transposed to tablecloths and runners suitable for modern use as wall decorations.\n\nThese vessels, made of black clay, reflect more than three hundred years of traditional Transdanubian folk patterns and shapes.

During the rule of K\u00e1rolyi's pacifist cabinet, Hungary lost the control over approx. 75% of its former pre-WW1 territories (325 411&nbsp;km\u00b2) without fight and was subject to foreign occupation. The [[Little Entente]], sensing an opportunity, invaded the country from three sides\u2014Romania [[Hungarian-Romanian War|invaded]] [[Transylvania]], Czechoslovakia annexed [[Upper Hungary]] (today's Slovakia), and a joint [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serb]]-[[French Army|French]] coalition annexed [[Vojvodina]] and other southern regions.

Though free elections continued, Horthy's personality, and those of his personally selected prime ministers, dominated the political scene. The government's actions continued to drift right with the passage of antisemitic laws and, due to the continued isolation of the Little Entente, economic and then political gravitation toward [[Kingdom of Italy#Fascist regime (1922\u20131943)|Italy]] and [[Nazi Germany|Germany]]. The [[Great Depression]] further exacerbated the situation and the popularity of fascist politicians such as [[Gyula G\u00f6mb\u00f6s]] and [[Ferenc Sz\u00e1lasi]], promising economic and social recovery, rose.\n\nHorthy's nationalist agenda reached its apogee in 1938 and 1940, when the Nazis rewarded Hungary's staunchly pro-Germany foreign policy in the [[First Vienna Award|First]] and [[Second Vienna Award]]s, respectively, peacefully restoring ethnic-Hungarian-majority areas lost after Trianon.

The Soviet leadership selected [[M\u00e1ty\u00e1s R\u00e1kosi]] to front the [[Stalinization]] of the country, and R\u00e1kosi ''de facto'' ruled Hungary from 1949 to 1956. His government's policies of militarization, industrialization, collectivization, and war compensation led to a severe decline in living standards. In imitation of Stalin's [[KGB]], the R\u00e1kosi government established a secret political police, the [[State Protection Authority|\u00c1VH]], to enforce the new regime. In the ensuing purges approximately 350,000 officials and intellectuals were imprisoned or executed from 1948 to 1956.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tamupress.com/product/First-Domino,4091.aspx |title=Granville/ frm |format=PDF |accessdate=20 September 2009}}</ref> Many freethinkers, democrats, and Horthy-era dignitaries were secretly arrested and extrajudicially interned in domestic and foreign [[Gulag]]s.

The following political cooling saw the ascent of [[Imre Nagy]] to the premiership, and the growing interest of students and intellectuals in political life. Nagy promised market liberalization and political openness, while R\u00e1kosi opposed both vigorously. R\u00e1kosi eventually managed to discredit Nagy and replace him with the more hard-line [[Ern\u0151 Ger\u0151]]. Hungary joined the [[Warsaw Pact]] in May 1955, as societal dissatisfaction with the regime swelled. Following the firing on peaceful demonstrations by Soviet soldiers and secret police, and rallies throughout the country on 23 October 1956, protesters took to the streets in Budapest, initiating the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|1956 Revolution]]. In an effort to quell the chaos, Nagy returned as premier, promised free elections, and took Hungary out of the Warsaw Pact.\n\nThe violence nonetheless continued as revolutionary militias sprung up against the Soviet Army and the \u00c1VH; the roughly 3,000-strong resistance fought Soviet tanks using [[Molotov cocktail]]s and machine-pistols. Though the preponderance of the Soviets was immense, they suffered heavy losses, and by 30 October 1956 most Soviet troops had withdrawn from Budapest to garrison the countryside. For a time, the Soviet leadership was unsure how to respond to developments in Hungary, but eventually decided to intervene to prevent a destabilization of the Soviet bloc. On 4 November reinforcements of more than 150,000 troops and 2,500 tanks entered the country from the Soviet Union.<ref>Findley, Carter V., and John Rothney. ''Twentieth Century World''. sixth ed. Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 2006. 278.</ref> Nearly 20,000 Hungarians were killed resisting the intervention, while an additional 21,600 were imprisoned afterwards for political reasons. Some 13,000 were interned and 230 brought to trial and executed. Nagy was secretly tried, found guilty, sentenced to death and executed by hanging in June 1958. Because borders were briefly opened, nearly a quarter of a million people fled the country by the time the revolution was suppressed.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/6065398.stm \"Hungary's 1956 brain drain\"], BBC News, 23 October 2006</ref>\n\n==== K\u00e1d\u00e1r era 1956\u20131988 ====\n{{See also|Goulash Communism}}\n[[File:J\u00e1nos K\u00e1d\u00e1r 1962.jpg|thumb|upright|[[J\u00e1nos K\u00e1d\u00e1r]], General Secretary of MSZMP, the [[Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party]] (1956\u20131988)]]\n\nAfter a second, briefer period of Soviet military occupation, [[J\u00e1nos K\u00e1d\u00e1r]], Nagy's former Minister of State, was chosen by the Soviet leadership to head the new government and chair the new ruling [[Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party|Socialist Workers' Party]] (MSzMP). K\u00e1d\u00e1r quickly normalized the situation. In 1963, the government granted a general amnesty and released the majority of those imprisoned for their active participation in the uprising. K\u00e1d\u00e1r proclaimed a new policy line, according to which the people were no longer compelled to profess loyalty to the party if they tacitly accepted the Socialist regime as a fact of life. In many speeches, he described this as, \"Those who are not against us are with us.\" K\u00e1d\u00e1r introduced new planning priorities in the economy, such as allowing farmers significant plots of private land within the collective farm system (''h\u00e1zt\u00e1ji gazd\u00e1lkod\u00e1s''). The living standard rose as consumer good and food production took precedence over military production, which was reduced to one tenth of pre-revolutionary levels.\n\nIn 1968, the [[New Economic Mechanism]] (NEM) introduced free-market elements into socialist command economy. From the 1960s through the late 1980s, Hungary was often referred to as \"[[the happiest barrack]]\" within the [[Eastern bloc]]. During the latter part of the Cold War Hungary's [[GDP per capita]] was fourth only to [[East Germany]], [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic|Czechoslovakia]], and the Soviet Union itself.<ref name=\"madison185\">*{{Cite book|last=Maddison|first=Angus |title=The world economy|publisher=OECD Publishing|year=2006|isbn=978-92-64-02261-4|page=185}}</ref> As a result of this relatively high standard of living, a more liberalized economy, a less censored press, and less restricted travel rights, Hungary was generally considered one of the more liberal countries in which to live in Central Europe during communism.

Although the MSzMP began [[Hungarian Round Table Talks|Round Table Talks]] with various opposition groups in March 1989, the reburial of Imre Nagy as a revolutionary martyr that June is widely considered the symbolic end of communism in Hungary. Over 100,000 people attended the Budapest ceremony without any significant government interference, and many speakers openly called for Soviet troops to leave the country. Free elections were held [[1990 Hungarian parliamentary election|in May 1990]], and the [[Hungarian Democratic Forum]], a major conservative opposition group, was elected to the head of a coalition government. [[J\u00f3zsef Antall]] became the first democratically elected Prime Minister since World War II.\n\nWith the removal of state subsidies and rapid privatization in 1991, Hungary was affected by a severe economic recession. The Antall government's austerity measures proved unpopular, and the Communist Party's legal and political heir, the [[Hungarian Socialist Party|Socialist Party]], won the subsequent [[1994 Hungarian parliamentary election|1994 elections]]. This abrupt shift in the political landscape was repeated in [[1998 Hungarian parliamentary election|1998]] and [[2002 Hungarian parliamentary election|2002]]; each electoral cycle, the governing party was ousted and the erstwhile opposition elected. Like most other post-communist European states, however, Hungary broadly pursued an [[European integration|integrationist]] agenda, [[Enlargement of NATO|joining]] [[NATO]] in 1999 and the European Union [[2003 Hungarian European Union membership referendum|in 2004]]. As a NATO member, Hungary was involved in the [[Yugoslav Wars]].\n\nIn 2006, [[2006 protests in Hungary|major protests]] erupted after it was revealed that Prime Minister [[Ferenc Gyurcs\u00e1ny]] had claimed in [[\u0150sz\u00f6d speech|a private speech]] that [[Hungarian Socialist Party|his party]] \"lied\" to win the [[2006 Hungarian parliamentary election|recent elections]].

The legislature consequently approved a [[Constitution of Hungary|new constitution]], among other sweeping governmental and legal changes.

Stephen promulgated [[Roman Catholicism]] as the state religion, and his successors were traditionally known as the [[Apostolic King]]s. The [[Catholic Church in Hungary]] remained strong through the centuries, and the [[Archbishop of Esztergom]] was granted extraordinary temporal privileges as [[prince-primate]] (''hercegpr\u00edm\u00e1s'') of Hungary. \n\nAlthough contemporary Hungary has no [[official religion]] and recognizes [[freedom of religion]] as a fundamental right, the Hungarian constitution \"recognizes Christianity's nation-building role\" in its preamble<ref>{{cite web|title=Magyarorsz\u00e1g Alapt\u00f6rv\u00e9nye|url=http://www.parlament.hu/irom39/02627/02627.pdf|website=Parlament.hu|publisher=Hungarian Parliament|accessdate=2 August 2014}}</ref> and in Article VII affirms that \"the state may cooperate with the churches for community goals.\"<ref>[https://www.constituteproject.org/constitution/Hungary_2011.pdf Hungary's Constitution of 2011]</ref>\n\nDuring the initial stages of the [[Protestant Reformation]], most Hungarians took up, first, [[Lutheranism]], then [[Calvinism]] in the form of the [[Hungarian Reformed Church]]. In the second half of the 16th century, the [[Jesuits]] led a [[Counterreformation]] campaign and the population once again became predominantly Catholic. This campaign was only partially successful, however, and the (mainly Reformed) Hungarian nobility were able to secure freedom of worship for Christians. In practice this meant ''[[cuius regio, eius religio]]''; thus, most individual localities in Hungary are still identifiable as historically Catholic, Lutheran, or Reformed. The country's eastern regions, especially around [[Debrecen]] (the \"Calvinist Rome\"), remain almost completely [[Reformed]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reformatus.hu/mutat/6819/ |title=Facts and Statistics |publisher=Reformatus.hu |date=4 March 2013 |accessdate=26 March 2013}}</ref> a trait they share with historically contiguous [[Hungarians in Romania|ethnically Hungarian regions]] across the Romanian border. \n\n[[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christianity]] in Hungary is associated with the country's ethnic minorities:[[Armenians]], [[Bulgarians]], [[Greeks]], [[Romanians]], [[Rusyns]], [[Ukrainians]], and [[Serbs]].\n\nHistorically, Hungary was home to a significant Jewish community.

In contrast to Historicism, Hungarian Art Nouveau is based on the national architectural characteristics. Taking the eastern origins of the Hungarians into account, [[\u00d6d\u00f6n Lechner]] (1845\u20131914), the most important figure in Hungarian Art Nouveau, was initially inspired by Indian and Syrian architecture, and later by traditional Hungarian decorative designs. In this way, he created an original synthesis of architectural styles. By applying them to three-dimensional architectural elements, he produced a version of Art Nouveau that was specific to Hungary.\n\nTurning away from the style of Lechner, yet taking inspiration from his approach, the group of \"Young People\" (''Fiatalok''), which included [[K\u00e1roly K\u00f3s]] and Dezs\u00f6 Zrumeczky, were to use the characteristic structures and forms of traditional Hungarian architecture to achieve the same end.\n\n[[File:Museum of Applied Arts (Budapest).jpg|thumb|The [[Museum of Applied Arts (Budapest)|Museum of Applied Arts]], an [[Art Nouveau]] building designed by [[\u00d6d\u00f6n Lechner]]]]\n\nBesides the two principal styles, Budapest also displays local versions of trends originating from other European countries. The Sezession from [[Vienna]], the German [[Jugendstil]], Art Nouveau from Belgium and France, and the influence of English and Finnish architecture are all reflected in the buildings constructed at the turn of the 20th century. [[B\u00e9la Lajta]] initially adopted Lechner's style, subsequently drawing his inspiration from English and Finnish trends; after developing an interest in the [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] style, he finally arrived at modern architecture. [[Alad\u00e1r \u00c1rkay]] took almost the same route. [[Istv\u00e1n Medgyaszay]] developed his own style, which differed from Lechner's, using stylised traditional motifs to create decorative designs in concrete. In the sphere of applied arts, those chiefly responsible for promoting the spread of Art Nouveau were the School and Museum of Decorative Arts, which opened in 1896.\n\nForeigners have unexpectedly \"discovered\" that a significantly large portion of the citizens live in old and architecturally valuable buildings.

Other renowned composers are [[Ern\u0151 Dohn\u00e1nyi|Dohn\u00e1nyi]], [[Franz Schmidt]], [[Zolt\u00e1n Kod\u00e1ly]], [[Gabriel von Wayditch]], [[Rudolf Wagner-R\u00e9geny]], [[L\u00e1szl\u00f3 Lajtha]], [[Franz Leh\u00e1r]], [[Imre K\u00e1lm\u00e1n]], [[S\u00e1ndor Veress]] and [[Mikl\u00f3s R\u00f3zsa|R\u00f3zsa]]. Hungarian traditional music tends to have a strong [[dactyl (poetry)|dactylic]] rhythm, as the language is invariably stressed on the first syllable of each word.\n\nHungary has renowned composers of contemporary classical music, [[Gy\u00f6rgy Ligeti]], [[Gy\u00f6rgy Kurt\u00e1g]], [[Peter E\u00f6tv\u00f6s|P\u00e9ter E\u00f6tv\u00f6s]], [[Zolt\u00e1n Kod\u00e1ly]] and [[Zolt\u00e1n Jeney]] among them. One of the greatest Hungarian composers, [[B\u00e9la Bart\u00f3k]], was also among the most significant musicians of the 20th century. His music was invigorated by the themes, modes, and rhythmic patterns of the Hungarian and neighboring folk music traditions he studied, which he synthesized with influences from his contemporaries into his own distinctive style.<ref>[http://mek.oszk.hu/02100/02172/html/index.html Szabolcsi] Although the Hungarian upper class has long had cultural and political connections with the rest of Europe, leading to an influx of European musical ideas, the rural peasants maintained their own traditions such that by the end of the 19th century Hungarian composers could draw on rural peasant music to (re)create a Hungarian classical style.

Since then, however, the Hungarian music industry has begun to recover, producing successful performers in the fields of [[jazz]] such as trumpeter [[Rudolf Tomsits]], pianist-composer [[K\u00e1roly Binder]] and, in a modernized form of Hungarian folk, [[Ferenc Seb\u0151]] and [[M\u00e1rta Sebesty\u00e9n]].

It is also the oldest surviving [[Uralic languages|Uralic]] poem.<br />\nAmong the first chronicles about Hungarian history were [[Gesta Hungarorum]] (\"Deeds of the Hungarians\") by the unknown author usually called ''Anonymus'', and [[Gesta Hunnorum et Hungarorum]] (\"Deeds of the Huns and the Hungarians\") by Simon K\u00e9zai. Both are in Latin. These chronicles mix history with legends, so historically they are not always authentic. Another chronicle is the ''K\u00e9pes kr\u00f3nika'' (Illustrated Chronicle), which was written for [[Louis I of Hungary|Louis the Great]].\n[[File:K\u00e9pes Kr\u00f3nika 1360.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Chronicon Pictum]], a medieval illustrated chronicle from the 14th century]]\n[[Renaissance]] literature flourished under the reign of [[Matthias Corvinus of Hungary|King Matthias]] (1458\u20131490). [[Janus Pannonius]], although he wrote in Latin, counts as one of the most important persons in Hungarian literature, being the only significant Hungarian Humanist poet of the period. The first printing house was also founded during Matthias' reign, by [[Andr\u00e1s Hess]], in Buda. The first book printed in Hungary was the [[Chronica Hungarorum]].\nThe most important poets of the period was [[B\u00e1lint Balassi]] (1554\u20131594) and [[Nikola Zrinski|Mikl\u00f3s Zr\u00ednyi]] (1620\u20131664).\n\nBalassi's poetry shows medieval influences, his poems can be divided into three sections: love poems, war poems and religious poems. Zr\u00ednyi's most significant work, the epic ''[[Peril of Sziget|Szigeti veszedelem]]'' (\"Peril of Sziget\", written in 1648/49) is written in a fashion similar to the ''[[Iliad]]'', and recounts the heroic [[Battle of Szigetv\u00e1r]], where his great-grandfather died while defending the castle of Szigetv\u00e1r.\nAmong the religious literary works the most important is the Bible translation by [[G\u00e1sp\u00e1r K\u00e1roli]] (The second Hungarian Bible translation in the history), the Protestant pastor of [[G\u00f6nc]], in 1590. The translation is called the ''Bible of Vizsoly'', after the town where it was first published.

The greatest poets of the time were [[Mih\u00e1ly Csokonai Vit\u00e9z]] and [[D\u00e1niel Berzsenyi]].\nThe greatest figure of the language reform was [[Ferenc Kazinczy]]. The [[Hungarian language]] became feasible for all type of scientific explanations from this time, and furthermore many new words were coined for describing new inventions.\n\n[[Hungarian literature]] has recently gained some renown outside the borders of Hungary (mostly through translations into German, French and English). Some modern Hungarian authors have become increasingly popular in Germany and Italy especially [[S\u00e1ndor M\u00e1rai]], [[P\u00e9ter Esterh\u00e1zy]], [[P\u00e9ter N\u00e1das]] and [[Imre Kert\u00e9sz]].

Unicum is a bitter, dark-coloured liqueur that can be drunk as an ap\u00e9ritif or after a meal, thus helping the digestion.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://zwackunicum.hu/en/markaink/unicum/|title= Unicum|publisher=[[Zwack]]}}</ref>\n\n=== Recreation ===\n[[File:H\u00e9v\u00edz.jpg|thumb|[[Lake H\u00e9v\u00edz]], the largest thermal lake in Europe]]\nHungary is a land of [[thermal]] water. A passion for spa culture and [[Hungarian history]] have been connected from the very beginning. Hungarian spas feature [[ancient Rome|Roman]], [[Greek architecture|Greek]], [[Architecture of Turkey|Turkish]], and northern country architectural elements.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.visitspas.eu/hungary/ |title=Hungary (Magyarorsz\u00e1g) \u2013 spa resorts & hotels |publisher=Visitspas.eu |accessdate=18 August 2012}}</ref>\n\nBecause of an advantageous geographical location, good quality thermal water can be found in great quantities on over 80% of Hungary's territory. Approximately 1,500 thermal springs can be found in Hungary (more than 100 just in the Capital area). There are approximately 450 public baths in Hungary.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.umvp.eu/english/about-hungary.html|title=New Hungary Rural Development Programme|website=Umvp.eu|access-date=23 January 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe [[ancient Rome|Romans]] heralded the first age of spas in Hungary. The remains of their bath complexes are still to be seen in [[\u00d3buda]]. Spa culture was revived during the [[Turkish Invasion]] and the thermal springs of [[Buda]] were used for the construction of a number of bathhouses, some of which such as ([[Kir\u00e1ly Baths]], [[Rudas Baths]]) are still functioning.\n\nIn the 19th century, the advancement in deep drilling and medical science provided the springboard for a further leap in bathing culture. Grand spas such as [[Gell\u00e9rt Baths]], Luk\u00e1cs Baths, [[Margaret Island]], and [[Sz\u00e9chenyi Medicinal Bath]] are a reflection of this resurgence in popularity. The Sz\u00e9chenyi Thermal Bath is the largest spa complex in Europe and it was the first thermal bath built in the Pest side of Budapest.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ticket.info.hu/en/program/baths-of-budapest/szechenyi-bath|title=Sz\u00e9chenyi Bath|publisher=Hung\u00e1ria Koncert Kft.|accessdate=13 July 2015|location=Budapest}}</ref> This building is a noted example of modern Renaissance style.

Cs\u00e1rd\u00e1s is the Hungarian name for the national dances, with Hungarian embroidered costumes and energetic music. From the men's intricate bootslapping dances to the ancient women's circle dances, Cs\u00e1rd\u00e1s demonstrates the infectious exuberance of the Hungarian folk dancing still celebrated in the villages.\n\n[[Verbunkos]] is a solo man's dance evolved from the recruiting performances of the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] army.\n\nThe [[Leg\u00e9nyes]] is a men's solo dance done by the ethnic Hungarian people living in the [[Kalotaszeg]] region of Transylvania. Although usually danced by young men, it can be also danced by older men. The dance is generally performed freestyle by one dancer at a time in front of a band. Women participate in the dance by standing in lines to the side, and singing or shouting verses while the men dance. Each man performs a number of points (dance phrases), typically four to eight without repetition. Each point consists of four parts, each lasting four counts. The first part is usually the same for everyone (there are only a few variations).\n\nIt was in the beginning of the 18th-century that the present style of Hungarian folk art took shape, incorporating both [[Renaissance]] and [[Baroque]] elements, depending on the area, as well as Persian [[Sassanide]] influences. Flowers and leaves, sometimes a bird or a spiral ornament, are the principal decorative themes. The most frequent ornament is a flower with a centerpiece resembling the eye of a peacock's feather.\n\nNearly all the manifestations of folk art practiced elsewhere in Europe also flourished among the [[hungarian people|Magyar]] peasantry at one time or another, their ceramics and textile being the most highly developed of all.\n\nThe finest achievements in their textile arts are the embroideries which vary from region to region. Those of [[Kalotaszeg]] in Transylvania are charming products of Oriental design, sewn chiefly in a single color&nbsp;\u2013 red, blue, or black. Soft in line, the embroideries are applied on altar cloths, pillow-cases and sheets.\n\nIn Hungary proper, S\u00e1rk\u00f6z in [[Transdanubia]] and the [[Mez\u0151k\u00f6vesd|Maty\u00f3f\u00f6ld]] in the [[Great Hungarian Plain]] produce the finest embroideries. In the [[Tolna (county)|S\u00e1rk\u00f6z]] region the women's caps show black and white designs as delicate as lace, and give evidence of the people's wonderfully subtle artistic feeling. The embroidery motifs applied to women's wear have also been transposed to tablecloths and runners suitable for modern use as wall decorations.\n\nThese vessels, made of black clay, reflect more than three hundred years of traditional Transdanubian folk patterns and shapes. No two are precisely alike, since all work is done by hand, including both the shaping and the decorating. The imprints are made by the thumb or a finger of the ceramist who makes the piece.\n\n=== Porcelain ===\n{{Main|Herend Porcelain|Zsolnay}}\nFounded in 1826, [[Herend Porcelain]] is one of the world's largest ceramic factories, specializing in luxury hand painted and gilded [[porcelain]]. In the mid-19th century it was purveyor to the [[Habsburg Dynasty]] and aristocratic customers throughout Europe. Many of its classic patterns are still in production. After the fall of communism in Hungary, the factory was privatised and is now 75% owned by its management and workers, exporting to over 60 countries of the world.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.herend.com/ |title=Herend Porcelain Manufactory Ltd |publisher=Herend.com |accessdate=20 September 2009}}</ref>\n\nZsolnay Porcelain Manufacture is a Hungarian manufacturer of porcelain, pottery, ceramics, tiles and stoneware. The company introduced the eosin glazing process and pyrogranite ceramics.\nThe Zsolnay factory was established by Mikl\u00f3s Zsolnay in [[P\u00e9cs]], Hungary, to produce stoneware and ceramics in 1853. In 1863, his son, [[Vilmos Zsolnay]] (1828\u20131900) joined the company and became its manager and director after several years. He led the factory to worldwide recognition by demonstrating its innovative products at world fairs and international exhibitions, including the 1873 World Fair in Vienna, then at the 1878 World Fair in Paris, where Zsolnay received a Grand Prix.\n\n=== Sport ===\n{{See also|Hungary at the Olympics}}\n[[File:Vaterpolo Hungary vs Italy semifinal game2.jpg|thumb|left|[[Hungary men's national water polo team]] is considered among the best in the world, holding the world record for Olympic golds and overall medals]]\n\n[[Hungary at the Olympics|Hungarian athletes]] have been successful contenders in the [[Olympic Games]], only ten countries have won more Olympic medals than Hungary, with a total of 498 medals ranking eighth in an [[all-time Olympic Games medal count]].
