The incident was recounted by recording engineer [[Geoff Emerick]] in his book ''Here, There, and Everywhere: My Life Recording the Music of The Beatles''.<ref>  {{cite book |last1=Emerick|first1=Geoff |last2=Massey|first2=Howard |title=Here, There, and Everywhere: My Life Recording the Music of The Beatles |publisher=Penguin|location=New York, NY |year=2006 |isbn=1-59240-179-1 |ref=harv|doi= }} Gotham Books, {{ISBN|1-59240-179-1}}</ref> According to Emerick, Lennon's wife [[Yoko Ono]] was in the recording studio and at one point helped herself to Harrison's box of McVitie's while the Beatles were in the control room listening to a playback of the song they'd just recorded. Harrison got angry at Ono, and his subsequent outburst caused Lennon to lose his temper in response.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WOk8TP8o018C&pg=PT309&lpg=PT309&dq=mcvities+digestive+george+john+beatles&source=bl&ots=zoO8XK2XSK&sig=Z3hgKUNcUjuZhanIjrqaYtD1J_U&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjS3unb_pvOAhUDyyYKHSjMBxgQ6AEIUjAI#v=onepage&q=mcvities+digestive+george+john+beatles&f=false|title=Here, There and Everywhere: My Life Recording the Music of the Beatles|first1=Geoff|last1=Emerick|first2=Howard|last2=Massey|date=16 March 2006|publisher=Penguin|accessdate=21 March 2018|via=Google Books}}</ref>\n\nChocolate digestives were the technical challenge to the bakers in [[The Great British Bake Off (series 3)#Episode 8: Biscuits|series 3, episode 8 of ''The Great British Bake Off'']].

Her father, Alexander Gross (originally Grosz), was a Hungarian Jewish immigrant and her mother, Isabella Crowley, an Irish-Italian Roman Catholic [[suffragette]], whose parents disapproved of the match.<ref>{{harvnb|Hartley|2002|p=17}}</ref>  Phyllis Gross was baptised a Roman Catholic.\n\nShe grew up with her older brother, the artist [[Anthony Gross]], in London and travelled all over Europe from an early age. Her father founded the [[cartographic]] company [[Geographia Ltd]],<ref>[http://www.georgeglazer.com/globes/globeref/globemakers.html#geographia Geographia Ltd. 20th Century London].</ref> which produced, among others, street maps of most British towns and although successful, eventually went bankrupt; Gross re-launched the company in the United States as the [[Geographia Map Company]] a few years later.\n\nHer parents had a very tense marriage which soon dissolved. Her mother remarried but died some years later in an asylum.\n\nPhyllis Gross was educated at [[Roedean School]], a private [[boarding school]] near [[Brighton]], which she had to leave when her father went bankrupt. She then became an English tutor in France, at a small school in [[F\u00e9camp]], [[Normandy]]. Later, she studied at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]], spending her first few months in Paris, sleeping rough before moving to a [[bedsit]] where she met the writer [[Vladimir Nabokov]].<ref>{{harvnb|Hartley|2002|p=156}}</ref> She started working as a shop assistant in a big department store, selling gloves.\n\nShe married Richard Pearsall, an artist friend of her brother.

Her father, Alexander Gross (originally Grosz), was a Hungarian Jewish immigrant and her mother, Isabella Crowley, an Irish-Italian Roman Catholic [[suffragette]], whose parents disapproved of the match.<ref>{{harvnb|Hartley|2002|p=17}}</ref>  Phyllis Gross was baptised a Roman Catholic.\n\nShe grew up with her older brother, the artist [[Anthony Gross]], in London and travelled all over Europe from an early age. Her father founded the [[cartographic]] company [[Geographia Ltd]],<ref>[http://www.georgeglazer.com/globes/globeref/globemakers.html#geographia Geographia Ltd. 20th Century London].</ref> which produced, among others, street maps of most British towns and although successful, eventually went bankrupt; Gross re-launched the company in the United States as the [[Geographia Map Company]] a few years later.\n\nHer parents had a very tense marriage which soon dissolved. Her mother remarried but died some years later in an asylum.\n\nPhyllis Gross was educated at [[Roedean School]], a private [[boarding school]] near [[Brighton]], which she had to leave when her father went bankrupt. She then became an English tutor in France, at a small school in [[F\u00e9camp]], [[Normandy]]. Later, she studied at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]], spending her first few months in Paris, sleeping rough before moving to a [[bedsit]] where she met the writer [[Vladimir Nabokov]].<ref>{{harvnb|Hartley|2002|p=156}}</ref> She started working as a shop assistant in a big department store, selling gloves.\n\nShe married Richard Pearsall, an artist friend of her brother.

{"title_page": "Oidor", "text_new": "An '''''oidor''''' ({{IPA-es|oj\u02c8\u00f0o\u027e}}) was a judge of the [[Audiencia Real|Royal ''Audiencias'' and ''Chanciller\u00edas'']], originally courts of [[Kingdom of Castile]], which became the highest organs of justice within the [[Spanish Empire]]. The term comes from the verb ''o\u00edr'', \"to hear,\" referring to the judge's obligation to listen to the parts of a judicial process, particularly during the phase of pleas.\n\n==Origins==\nThe [[Cortes Generales|Cortes of Alcal\u00e1]] of 1348 asked that King [[Henry II of Castile]]  publicly hear cases at least once or twice a week along with his advisors, because under medieval Castilian [[jurisprudence]] the king was to personally hear all cases that fell under his jurisdiction, but the caseload was becoming too great. The Cortes also asked the King to delegate some of his powers to his advisors, so that they \"could judge in his name.\"<ref>Alonso Romero, Mar\u00eda Paz, \"La Monarqu\u00eda castellana y su proyecci\u00f3n institucional (1230-1350)\u201d in ''Historia de Espa\u00f1a de Ram\u00f3n Men\u00e9ndez Pidal: tomo XIII.

(Madrid: Espasa-Calpe 1990), 558. {{ISBN|978-84-239-4815-4}}</ref> The documents of the Cortes of Alcal\u00e1 began to refer to these delegates as ''oidores'' and the new institution they formed as the ''[[Audiencia Real|audiencia]]''.  This early ''audiencia'' was still closely tied to the king's personal right to judge.<ref>33rd plea of the \"Cuaderno de Petici\u00f3nes\" of the Cortes of Le\u00f3n and Castile.</ref> In reviewing the cases before them, ''oidores'' relied on summaries prepared by court lawyers known as ''relatores''.<ref>Kellogg, Susan.

(University of Oklahoma Press, 2005), 10.</ref>\n\n==Spanish America and the Philippines==\nAs the [[Crown of Castile]] found its territories rapidly expanding half a world away during the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas]] and the [[Spanish East Indies|Spanish Philippines]], it found it necessary to grant its overseas ''oidores'' functions and powers, which in the mother country normally fell to other officials. Thus, the ''oidores'' of the overseas ''audiencias'' functioned not only as judges of the ''audiencia'', but also as magistrates overseeing the sale of the Holy Crusade [[indulgence]]s (''juez de la Santa Cruzada''), [[Mortgage loan|mortgages]] and [[ground rent]]s (''juez de censos''), [[probate]] issues (''juez de bienes de difuntos''), and [[legal separation]] (''oidor juez de casados''). In the ''audiencias'' in which the criminal judges (''alcaldes del crimen'') met as a separate chamber, as those of [[Mexico City]] and [[Lima]], it was not uncommon for one person to serve as both ''oidor'' (civil judge) and an ''alcalde del crimen''.

The Cortes also asked the King to delegate some of his powers to his advisors, so that they \"could judge in his name.\"<ref>Alonso Romero, Mar\u00eda Paz, \"La Monarqu\u00eda castellana y su proyecci\u00f3n institucional (1230-1350)\u201d in ''Historia de Espa\u00f1a de Ram\u00f3n Men\u00e9ndez Pidal: tomo XIII.

Thus, the ''oidores'' of the overseas ''audiencias'' functioned not only as judges of the ''audiencia'', but also as magistrates overseeing the sale of the Holy Crusade [[indulgence]]s (''juez de la Santa Cruzada''), [[Mortgage loan|mortgages]] and [[ground rent]]s (''juez de censos''), [[probate]] issues (''juez de bienes de difuntos''), and [[legal separation]] (''oidor juez de casados''). In the ''audiencias'' in which the criminal judges (''alcaldes del crimen'') met as a separate chamber, as those of [[Mexico City]] and [[Lima]], it was not uncommon for one person to serve as both ''oidor'' (civil judge) and an ''alcalde del crimen''.  Moreover, upon the death or incapacity of a [[governor]] or [[viceroy]], either the senior ''oidor'' (''oidor decano'') or the ''audiencia'' as a whole would serve as the interim governor or viceroy, depending on the specific [[Laws of the Indies|law of the territory]].\n\n==Marriage disputes==\nThe ''oidor de casados'' was a special type of judge that arose to deal with the de facto separation of many married couples during the colonization of the New World and the fact that many married men abandoned their lawful wives upon leaving Spain and entered into informal relationships with either [[Indigenous peoples|native]] or [[Ethnic groups in Europe|European]] women.

The Aswang is especially popular in Visayas, southern parts of Luzon, and parts of Mindanao.\n\n== Description and taxonomy ==\nAccording to Maximo Ramos, the term \"aswang\" can be thought of as an aggregate term for a multitude of Filipino supernatural creatures. These creatures can be organized into five categories that parallel creatures from Western traditions. These categories are the vampire, the self-segmenting viscera sucker, the weredog, the witch, and the ghoul.<ref name=\":4\">{{cite journal |last1=Ramos |first1=Maximo |title=The Aswang Syncrasy in Philippine Folklore |journal=Western Folklore |date=Oct 1969 |volume=28 |issue=4 |pages=238\u2013248 |jstor=1499218 |doi=10.2307/1499218 }}</ref>\n\n=== The vampire ===\nThe vampire aswang disguises itself in the shape of a beautiful woman. It shares its diet of blood with vampires of Western cultures. However, it differs by sucking blood using a proboscis-like tongue, rather than sharpened teeth. Furthermore, aswang do not live in tombs. Some live in forests far from human communities, but the aswang can infiltrate human society by means of marrying into a community, and either slowly draining their husband of blood, or else using it strictly as a hideout and leaving at night to raid other villages, thereby keeping their cover intact.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ramos |first1=Maximo |title=The Aswang Syncrasy in Philippine Folklore |journal=Western Folklore |date=Oct 1969 |volume=28 |issue=4 |pages=238\u2013239 |jstor=1499218 |doi=10.2307/1499218 }}</ref> One example of a vampire aswang is the Tagalog ''mandurugo'', said to live in the region of Capiz.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Bunson |first1=Matthew |title=The Vampire Encyclopedia |date=1993 |publisher=Gramercy Books |location=New York |page=169}}</ref>\n\n=== The viscera sucker ===\nThe viscera sucker is said to have a diet of internal organs, or the phlegmatic discharge of the sick. Like the vampire aswang, it consumes its food with its tongue, narrow and tubular, but not pointed like the vampire. By day, it takes the shape of an attractive, light-skinned, and long-haired woman. By night, it grows wings and segments itself, leaving behind its body from the waist downwards. It takes great care to hide its lower half, then flies in searches for victims. It is particularly attracted to the fetuses growing inside pregnant women. Viscera suckers are said to live in domiciles deep in the jungle, if not the trees themselves. But like the vampire aswang, most infiltrate human communities via marriage.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ramos |first1=Maximo |title=The Aswang Syncrasy in Philippine Folklore |journal=Western Folklore |date=Oct 1969 |volume=28 |issue=4 |pages=239\u2013242 |jstor=1499218 }}</ref>\n\n=== The weredog ===\nMaximo Ramos refers to this category as the weredog, though the creature does not necessarily transform into a dog. Ramos reasons that the werecreature of a given region is named after their most ferocious creature. As such, Europe has werewolves and India weretigers. The Philippines has no indigenous wolf population, thus making weredog the more appropriate term.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ramos |first1=Maximo |title=The Aswang Syncrasy in Philippine Folklore |journal=Western Folklore |date=Oct 1969 |volume=28 |issue=4 |page=242 |jstor=1499218 }}</ref> Like the previous aswang, the weredog infiltrates villages and turns into a creature by night, around midnight. The creature is most commonly a dog, but a cat or boar is also possible. The weredog then kills and eats people, particularly pregnant women on the road in the night, and do not let their long hair hang loose. (Doing so is said to protect against these aswang.) The weredog is said to develop a taste for human flesh by eating food spat on, or licked, by another weredog. (The same is said of the viscera sucker.) Unlike the previous aswang, the weredog does not infiltrate human communities through marriage, but as a traveler of some sort, such as a peddler or a construction labourer.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ramos |first1=Maximo |title=The Aswang Syncrasy in Philippine Folklore |journal=Western Folklore |date=Oct 1969 |volume=28 |issue=4 |pages=242\u2013244 |jstor=1499218 }}</ref>\n\n=== The witch ===\nWitch aswang are characterized by extreme vindictiveness, laying curses upon those who have crossed her by making certain objects, such as rice, bones, or insects, come out of the bodily orifices of the cursed. Witches have eyes that reflect images upside down, as well as elongated irises. They live in the outskirts of towns and villages.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ramos |first1=Maximo |title=The Aswang Syncrasy in Philippine Folklore |journal=Western Folklore |date=Oct 1969 |volume=28 |issue=4 |pages=244\u2013245 |jstor=1499218 }}</ref> Witches in the Philippines are feared, avoided and hated. Witches can become aswang, only if they have certain qualities that follow an aswang already. Then they can become an aswang, and by doing so their powers become stronger, stronger than the other witches as well. If an aswang is caught, they are to be immediately killed without question. Though with witches there is just complete avoidance by the people and people around them regard them with fear. Though if an incident were to happen near the witch's residence, then there is reason to turn to the witch to blame and punish.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The story of the aswang|last=Brioso, Amador F., Jr.|isbn=9789719482581|location=Mandaluyong|oclc=969973375|year = 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== The ghoul ===\nGhoul aswang are described as humanoid but generally hidden. Their diet consists of human corpses, they are carrion-eaters. Their nails and teeth are sharp and strong to help with the theft and consumption of the corpses. Their diet makes them smell rank and pungent. They gather in trees near cemeteries to exhume and consume the fresh burials.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ramos |first1=Maximo |title=The Aswang Syncrasy in Philippine Folklore |journal=Western Folklore |date=Oct 1969 |volume=28 |issue=4 |pages=245\u2013248 |jstor=1499218 }}</ref>\n\n== Behaviour ==\nAswangs commonly dwell at night in locations such as cemeteries and woods, as their powers are significantly, or sometimes totally, reduced during the daytime.<ref name=\"raul\">{{cite journal |last1=Pertierra |first1=Raul |title=Viscera-Suckers and Female Sociality: The Philippine Asuang |journal=Philippine Studies |date=1983 |volume=31 |issue=3 |pages=322 |jstor=42633556 }}</ref> However, despite being described as wild monsters that often live in the wilderness and outskirts of society, aswangs are also described as creatures that are capable of living within close proximity of or even within the confines of a village, leading to several reports of aswang attacks within large, populated towns and cities. Their ability to adapt and live within the urban and rural environments populated by humans while still maintaining their feral, monstrous nature is cited as a feature that distinguishes aswangs from most other monsters.<ref name=\"raul\"/> Aswangs also generally have a fear of light. Wakes were often brightly lit to ensure that aswang would not come to the funeral to steal and devour the corpse. They also have a disdain for noise, but rare occasions describe aswangs attending noisy parties.<ref name=\"raul\"/>\n\nAswangs are traditionally described as one-dimensional monsters and inherently evil by nature with no explicable motives beyond harming and devouring other creatures. Their overtly evil behaviour may be described as an inversion of traditional Filipino values.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Pertierra |first1=Raul |title=Viscera-Suckers and Female Sociality: The Philippine Asuang |journal=Philippine Studies |date=1983 |volume=31 |issue=3 |pages=324 |jstor=42633556 }}</ref> Traditional aswangs have no bias when selecting their prey and will not hesitate to target their own kin: an inversion of the traditional Filipino value of strong kinship and family closeness. Aswangs are described to be unclean and favor raw human meat to contrast the value of cleanliness and the cooked, spiced, and flavourful food found in traditional Filipino culture. The aswangs are also often described to be lewd in behaviour, with female aswangs often exposing their genitals to contrast values of traditional modesty.\n\n=== Countermeasures ===\nThere are several remedies and countermeasures to drive away or slay aswang. The different countermeasures often vary  depending on the cultural and symbolic significance of each tool. Holy objects, spices, salt, ash, the tail of a sting-ray, large crustaceans, vinegar, betel nut chew, and urine are all listed as tools for protection against aswang. The reversal of a ladder leading to the house was also said to be a countermeasure against aswang.<ref name=\"raul\"/>\n\nBecause aswang were believed to be the cause of miscarriages, countermeasures to drive aswang away and prevent them from prowling during childbirth were developed.  One method is for the husband of the child-bearing wife to remain under the house naked while furiously waving a sword.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Pertierra |first1=Raul |title=Viscera-Suckers and Female Sociality: The Philippine Asuang |journal=Philippine Studies |date=1983 |volume=31 |issue=3 |pages=323 |jstor=42633556 }}</ref> Sharp sticks or bolos should be inserted between the bamboos of the house floor to prevent aswangs from lurking under the house.  Additionally, sick people should not stay in houses with holes and are told not to groan in order not to attract aswang.<ref name=\"Lynch\">{{cite book |last=Lynch |first=Frank |date=1998 |title=The Aswang Inquiry |location=Quezon City |publisher=GCF Books |pages=1\u201331 }}</ref>\n\nThere is also a special anti-aswang oil that can be developed.<ref name=\"Lynch\"/> To make this oil, select a particular coconut and watch it grow. Pick it at twilight during a full moon when it is wet and gloomy; the breeze should also be chilly. To coconut should be grated and its juice must be squeezed out. Boil the mixture until it becomes oil. Recite secret prayers and throw all the waste into the ocean so that aswang cannot trace whoever made the oil. Once complete, the oil should be hung at the door of the house; it will boil when an aswang is near.\n\nThere are other methods of detecting aswang without the use of the special oil. Scratching noises heard from the ceiling of a house is often a sign of a nearby aswang. Aswangs in disguise can be detected by seeing if your reflection in the creature's eye is inverted.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Leach |first1=Maria |title=God Had a Dog: Folklore of the Dog |date=1961 |publisher=Rutgers University Press |page=169 |url=https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=XpkiAAAAMAAJ |accessdate=25 April 2020 |language=en}}</ref> Additionally, dogs, cats, and pigs with no tails are said to be aswangs in disguise. During holy masses, aswangs will also dodge attempt to dodge the blessings.<ref name=\"Lynch\"/>\n\nTo kill a witch aswang, a bolo knife can be used to strike the middle of the witch's back; if that area is not struck, the witch can lick its wounds to heal its injuries. After slaying an aswang with a bolo, the bolo must be planted under the ground. Firearms are not advised for killing aswangs and it is useless to stab and slash at an aswang while it is in the form of an animal. Magic prayers can be used to make the aswang vulnerable; while it is in this helpless state, its body must be cut into pieces. If the aswang is cut into two pieces, each piece must be separated and taken to opposite river banks.<ref name=\"Lynch\"/>\n\n== Origins and influences ==\nBecause of the archipelagic geography of the Philippines, and the primarily oral mode of inheriting and imparting narratives from the past for preservation or didactic purposes, stories about the aswang have evolved and adapted according to the locality in question.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nThe Aswang was born out of Philippine folklore, with stories of this terrifying creature dating back to at least the 16th century, when Spanish explorers created the first written record of monster. The explorers noted that of all the monsters in their folklore, the Aswang was the most feared by native people.<ref>{{Citation|last=Mythology.net|title=Aswang|date=2016-10-21|url=https://mythology.net/monsters/aswang/|access-date=2019-04-19}}</ref> \nOne of the most famous origins of the term aswang came from the aswang tradition in the Bicol region during the sixteenth century.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Lynch |first1=Frank |title=Ang Mga Aswang: A Bicol Belief |journal=Religious Belief and Behavior Series |date=1963 |volume=1 |page=55.84\u201388 }}</ref> The Bicolanos believed in the God named Gugurang, who was the good God that acted as the beneficent of their region, the defender and guardian of their homes, and their protector against the evil of the God Asuang. The God Asuang, however, was the evil God and rival, who attempted to always cause harm to Gugurang and found pleasure in doing so. Gugurang was always praised by the Bicolanos, and Asuang shunned and cursed.\n\nHowever, in another story, Gugurang is portrayed as a fire-wielding God who, if displeased with the humans, would cause [[Mt. Mayon]] to erupt.<ref>{{cite web |last1=The Aswang Project |title=Asuang & Gugurang |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHtYHrSef6Q |website=The Aswang Project |publisher=High Banks Entertainment Ltd. |accessdate=22 April 2019}}</ref> Asuang had no control over the people and became jealous of Gugurang's power. As Asuang begged for Gugurang's fire, Gugurang felt that Asuang was only trying to have fire to win the favor of the people, and the two began to argue for centuries. But Asuang was able to [[Theft of fire|steal fire]] by turning himself invisible and hiding the fire in a coconut shell. However, Asuang was unable to control the power and caused the entire world to catch flames. Gugurang followed the flames which led him to Asuang and take the fire back. He called the Gods to help him put out the fire with rain and take revenge on Asuang by making thunder and lightning to strike the mountains. The act brought upon all the evils and destruction in the land, which the people had never forgotten Asuang for.\n\n=== Home of the aswang ===\nAswang are most commonly associated with the province of [[Capiz]], which lies on the island of [[Panay]] at the [[Western Visayas]] region,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kyotoreview.org/issue-12/in-search-of-aswang-a-ghost-story-monster-and-sorcerer-in-philippine-society/|title=In Search of Aswang: A Ghost Story, Monster and Sorcerer in Philippine Society|website=Kyoto Review of Southeast Asia|language=en-US|access-date=2019-04-19}}</ref> so much so that Capiz has come to be dubbed as the creature's \"hometown\".<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://mythology.net/monsters/aswang/|title=Aswang - Mythical Creature from Philippine|last=Geller|first=Prof|date=2016-10-08|website=Mythology.net|language=en-US|access-date=2019-04-19}}</ref> In an April 29, 2019 documentary of ''[[Kapuso Mo, Jessica Soho]]'' (KMJS), aswang are also allegedly sighted in [[Himamaylan]], [[Negros Occidental]], which also lies at Western Visayas, where several residents have been reportedly terrorized by the appearance of the aswang at night.<ref name=kmjs>{{cite news |title=Kapuso Mo, Jessica Soho: Pagala-galang 'Yanggaw' sa Himamaylan, totoo nga ba? |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0zKoAFyHVQ |publisher=[[GMA News and Public Affairs]]|via=[[YouTube]]}} (10:29) Ang maaaring pinanggagalingan daw ng kababalaghan ang punong ito.

It shares its diet of blood with vampires of Western cultures. However, it differs by sucking blood using a proboscis-like tongue, rather than sharpened teeth. Furthermore, aswang do not live in tombs. Some live in forests far from human communities, but the aswang can infiltrate human society by means of marrying into a community, and either slowly draining their husband of blood, or else using it strictly as a hideout and leaving at night to raid other villages, thereby keeping their cover intact.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ramos |first1=Maximo |title=The Aswang Syncrasy in Philippine Folklore |journal=Western Folklore |date=Oct 1969 |volume=28 |issue=4 |pages=238\u2013239 |jstor=1499218 |doi=10.2307/1499218 }}</ref> One example of a vampire aswang is the Tagalog ''mandurugo'', said to live in the region of Capiz.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Bunson |first1=Matthew |title=The Vampire Encyclopedia |date=1993 |publisher=Gramercy Books |location=New York |page=169}}</ref>\n\n=== The viscera sucker ===\nThe viscera sucker is said to have a diet of internal organs, or the phlegmatic discharge of the sick. Like the vampire aswang, it consumes its food with its tongue, narrow and tubular, but not pointed like the vampire. By day, it takes the shape of an attractive, light-skinned, and long-haired woman. By night, it grows wings and segments itself, leaving behind its body from the waist downwards. It takes great care to hide its lower half, then flies in searches for victims. It is particularly attracted to the fetuses growing inside pregnant women. Viscera suckers are said to live in domiciles deep in the jungle, if not the trees themselves. But like the vampire aswang, most infiltrate human communities via marriage.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ramos |first1=Maximo |title=The Aswang Syncrasy in Philippine Folklore |journal=Western Folklore |date=Oct 1969 |volume=28 |issue=4 |pages=239\u2013242 |jstor=1499218 }}</ref>\n\n=== The weredog ===\nMaximo Ramos refers to this category as the weredog, though the creature does not necessarily transform into a dog. Ramos reasons that the werecreature of a given region is named after their most ferocious creature. As such, Europe has werewolves and India weretigers. The Philippines has no indigenous wolf population, thus making weredog the more appropriate term.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ramos |first1=Maximo |title=The Aswang Syncrasy in Philippine Folklore |journal=Western Folklore |date=Oct 1969 |volume=28 |issue=4 |page=242 |jstor=1499218 }}</ref> Like the previous aswang, the weredog infiltrates villages and turns into a creature by night, around midnight. The creature is most commonly a dog, but a cat or boar is also possible. The weredog then kills and eats people, particularly pregnant women on the road in the night, and do not let their long hair hang loose. (Doing so is said to protect against these aswang.) The weredog is said to develop a taste for human flesh by eating food spat on, or licked, by another weredog. (The same is said of the viscera sucker.) Unlike the previous aswang, the weredog does not infiltrate human communities through marriage, but as a traveler of some sort, such as a peddler or a construction labourer.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ramos |first1=Maximo |title=The Aswang Syncrasy in Philippine Folklore |journal=Western Folklore |date=Oct 1969 |volume=28 |issue=4 |pages=242\u2013244 |jstor=1499218 }}</ref>\n\n=== The witch ===\nWitch aswang are characterized by extreme vindictiveness, laying curses upon those who have crossed her by making certain objects, such as rice, bones, or insects, come out of the bodily orifices of the cursed. Witches have eyes that reflect images upside down, as well as elongated irises. They live in the outskirts of towns and villages.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ramos |first1=Maximo |title=The Aswang Syncrasy in Philippine Folklore |journal=Western Folklore |date=Oct 1969 |volume=28 |issue=4 |pages=244\u2013245 |jstor=1499218 }}</ref> Witches in the Philippines are feared, avoided and hated. Witches can become aswang, only if they have certain qualities that follow an aswang already. Then they can become an aswang, and by doing so their powers become stronger, stronger than the other witches as well. If an aswang is caught, they are to be immediately killed without question. Though with witches there is just complete avoidance by the people and people around them regard them with fear. Though if an incident were to happen near the witch's residence, then there is reason to turn to the witch to blame and punish.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The story of the aswang|last=Brioso, Amador F., Jr.|isbn=9789719482581|location=Mandaluyong|oclc=969973375|year = 2015}}</ref>\n\n=== The ghoul ===\nGhoul aswang are described as humanoid but generally hidden. Their diet consists of human corpses, they are carrion-eaters. Their nails and teeth are sharp and strong to help with the theft and consumption of the corpses. Their diet makes them smell rank and pungent. They gather in trees near cemeteries to exhume and consume the fresh burials.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Ramos |first1=Maximo |title=The Aswang Syncrasy in Philippine Folklore |journal=Western Folklore |date=Oct 1969 |volume=28 |issue=4 |pages=245\u2013248 |jstor=1499218 }}</ref>\n\n== Behaviour ==\nAswangs commonly dwell at night in locations such as cemeteries and woods, as their powers are significantly, or sometimes totally, reduced during the daytime.<ref name=\"raul\">{{cite journal |last1=Pertierra |first1=Raul |title=Viscera-Suckers and Female Sociality: The Philippine Asuang |journal=Philippine Studies |date=1983 |volume=31 |issue=3 |pages=322 |jstor=42633556 }}</ref> However, despite being described as wild monsters that often live in the wilderness and outskirts of society, aswangs are also described as creatures that are capable of living within close proximity of or even within the confines of a village, leading to several reports of aswang attacks within large, populated towns and cities. Their ability to adapt and live within the urban and rural environments populated by humans while still maintaining their feral, monstrous nature is cited as a feature that distinguishes aswangs from most other monsters.<ref name=\"raul\"/> Aswangs also generally have a fear of light. Wakes were often brightly lit to ensure that aswang would not come to the funeral to steal and devour the corpse. They also have a disdain for noise, but rare occasions describe aswangs attending noisy parties.<ref name=\"raul\"/>\n\nAswangs are traditionally described as one-dimensional monsters and inherently evil by nature with no explicable motives beyond harming and devouring other creatures. Their overtly evil behaviour may be described as an inversion of traditional Filipino values.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Pertierra |first1=Raul |title=Viscera-Suckers and Female Sociality: The Philippine Asuang |journal=Philippine Studies |date=1983 |volume=31 |issue=3 |pages=324 |jstor=42633556 }}</ref> Traditional aswangs have no bias when selecting their prey and will not hesitate to target their own kin: an inversion of the traditional Filipino value of strong kinship and family closeness. Aswangs are described to be unclean and favor raw human meat to contrast the value of cleanliness and the cooked, spiced, and flavourful food found in traditional Filipino culture. The aswangs are also often described to be lewd in behaviour, with female aswangs often exposing their genitals to contrast values of traditional modesty.\n\n=== Countermeasures ===\nThere are several remedies and countermeasures to drive away or slay aswang. The different countermeasures often vary  depending on the cultural and symbolic significance of each tool. Holy objects, spices, salt, ash, the tail of a sting-ray, large crustaceans, vinegar, betel nut chew, and urine are all listed as tools for protection against aswang. The reversal of a ladder leading to the house was also said to be a countermeasure against aswang.<ref name=\"raul\"/>\n\nBecause aswang were believed to be the cause of miscarriages, countermeasures to drive aswang away and prevent them from prowling during childbirth were developed.  One method is for the husband of the child-bearing wife to remain under the house naked while furiously waving a sword.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Pertierra |first1=Raul |title=Viscera-Suckers and Female Sociality: The Philippine Asuang |journal=Philippine Studies |date=1983 |volume=31 |issue=3 |pages=323 |jstor=42633556 }}</ref> Sharp sticks or bolos should be inserted between the bamboos of the house floor to prevent aswangs from lurking under the house.  Additionally, sick people should not stay in houses with holes and are told not to groan in order not to attract aswang.<ref name=\"Lynch\">{{cite book |last=Lynch |first=Frank |date=1998 |title=The Aswang Inquiry |location=Quezon City |publisher=GCF Books |pages=1\u201331 }}</ref>\n\nThere is also a special anti-aswang oil that can be developed.<ref name=\"Lynch\"/> To make this oil, select a particular coconut and watch it grow. Pick it at twilight during a full moon when it is wet and gloomy; the breeze should also be chilly. To coconut should be grated and its juice must be squeezed out. Boil the mixture until it becomes oil. Recite secret prayers and throw all the waste into the ocean so that aswang cannot trace whoever made the oil. Once complete, the oil should be hung at the door of the house; it will boil when an aswang is near.\n\nThere are other methods of detecting aswang without the use of the special oil. Scratching noises heard from the ceiling of a house is often a sign of a nearby aswang. Aswangs in disguise can be detected by seeing if your reflection in the creature's eye is inverted.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Leach |first1=Maria |title=God Had a Dog: Folklore of the Dog |date=1961 |publisher=Rutgers University Press |page=169 |url=https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=XpkiAAAAMAAJ |accessdate=25 April 2020 |language=en}}</ref> Additionally, dogs, cats, and pigs with no tails are said to be aswangs in disguise. During holy masses, aswangs will also dodge attempt to dodge the blessings.<ref name=\"Lynch\"/>\n\nTo kill a witch aswang, a bolo knife can be used to strike the middle of the witch's back; if that area is not struck, the witch can lick its wounds to heal its injuries. After slaying an aswang with a bolo, the bolo must be planted under the ground. Firearms are not advised for killing aswangs and it is useless to stab and slash at an aswang while it is in the form of an animal. Magic prayers can be used to make the aswang vulnerable; while it is in this helpless state, its body must be cut into pieces. If the aswang is cut into two pieces, each piece must be separated and taken to opposite river banks.<ref name=\"Lynch\"/>\n\n== Origins and influences ==\nBecause of the archipelagic geography of the Philippines, and the primarily oral mode of inheriting and imparting narratives from the past for preservation or didactic purposes, stories about the aswang have evolved and adapted according to the locality in question.<ref name=\":4\" />\n\nThe Aswang was born out of Philippine folklore, with stories of this terrifying creature dating back to at least the 16th century, when Spanish explorers created the first written record of monster. The explorers noted that of all the monsters in their folklore, the Aswang was the most feared by native people.<ref>{{Citation|last=Mythology.net|title=Aswang|date=2016-10-21|url=https://mythology.net/monsters/aswang/|access-date=2019-04-19}}</ref> \nOne of the most famous origins of the term aswang came from the aswang tradition in the Bicol region during the sixteenth century.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Lynch |first1=Frank |title=Ang Mga Aswang: A Bicol Belief |journal=Religious Belief and Behavior Series |date=1963 |volume=1 |page=55.84\u201388 }}</ref> The Bicolanos believed in the God named Gugurang, who was the good God that acted as the beneficent of their region, the defender and guardian of their homes, and their protector against the evil of the God Asuang. The God Asuang, however, was the evil God and rival, who attempted to always cause harm to Gugurang and found pleasure in doing so. Gugurang was always praised by the Bicolanos, and Asuang shunned and cursed.\n\nHowever, in another story, Gugurang is portrayed as a fire-wielding God who, if displeased with the humans, would cause [[Mt. Mayon]] to erupt.<ref>{{cite web |last1=The Aswang Project |title=Asuang & Gugurang |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nHtYHrSef6Q |website=The Aswang Project |publisher=High Banks Entertainment Ltd. |accessdate=22 April 2019}}</ref> Asuang had no control over the people and became jealous of Gugurang's power. As Asuang begged for Gugurang's fire, Gugurang felt that Asuang was only trying to have fire to win the favor of the people, and the two began to argue for centuries. But Asuang was able to [[Theft of fire|steal fire]] by turning himself invisible and hiding the fire in a coconut shell. However, Asuang was unable to control the power and caused the entire world to catch flames. Gugurang followed the flames which led him to Asuang and take the fire back. He called the Gods to help him put out the fire with rain and take revenge on Asuang by making thunder and lightning to strike the mountains. The act brought upon all the evils and destruction in the land, which the people had never forgotten Asuang for.\n\n=== Home of the aswang ===\nAswang are most commonly associated with the province of [[Capiz]], which lies on the island of [[Panay]] at the [[Western Visayas]] region,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kyotoreview.org/issue-12/in-search-of-aswang-a-ghost-story-monster-and-sorcerer-in-philippine-society/|title=In Search of Aswang: A Ghost Story, Monster and Sorcerer in Philippine Society|website=Kyoto Review of Southeast Asia|language=en-US|access-date=2019-04-19}}</ref> so much so that Capiz has come to be dubbed as the creature's \"hometown\".<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://mythology.net/monsters/aswang/|title=Aswang - Mythical Creature from Philippine|last=Geller|first=Prof|date=2016-10-08|website=Mythology.net|language=en-US|access-date=2019-04-19}}</ref> In an April 29, 2019 documentary of ''[[Kapuso Mo, Jessica Soho]]'' (KMJS), aswang are also allegedly sighted in [[Himamaylan]], [[Negros Occidental]], which also lies at Western Visayas, where several residents have been reportedly terrorized by the appearance of the aswang at night.<ref name=kmjs>{{cite news |title=Kapuso Mo, Jessica Soho: Pagala-galang 'Yanggaw' sa Himamaylan, totoo nga ba? |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d0zKoAFyHVQ |publisher=[[GMA News and Public Affairs]]|via=[[YouTube]]}} (10:29) Ang maaaring pinanggagalingan daw ng kababalaghan ang punong ito.
