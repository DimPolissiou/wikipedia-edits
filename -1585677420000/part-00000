'''9''' \u2013 via St. John's University School of Law.</ref>}}To truly understand the meaning of environmental racism, one must define each word. The term \u201cenvironment\u201d is a term that must be understood as it sets where everything takes place. The Environmental Justice Movement defines the environment as, \u201cWhere we live, work, play, learn and pray\u201d.<ref name=\"greenaction.org\">{{Cite web|url=http://greenaction.org/what-is-environmental-justice/|title=Environmental Justice & Environmental Racism \u2013 Greenaction for Health and Environmental Justice|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-24}}</ref> This definition by this movement demonstrates the broadness and multiple interacting levels that are at play here. There are large factions of people that all need equal access to work, recreation, education, religion, and safe neighborhoods to get the most out of their experience in their community. Environmental justice is what combats inequalities within these sectors. The Environmental Justice Movement explains that, \u201cEnvironmental Justice refers to those cultural norms and values, rules, regulations, behaviors, policies, and decisions to support sustainability, where all people can hold with confidence that their community and natural environment is safe and productive\u201d.<ref name=\"greenaction.org\"/> Citizens of every race and creed depend on being able to experience their cultures and values in a fair space. Environmental racism is a specific form of environmental injustice with which the underlying cause of said injustice is believed to be race-based. <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Fritz|first=Jan M.|date=1999|title=Searching for EnvironmentalJustice: National Stories,Global Possibilities|url=|journal=Social Justice|volume=26|pages=175|via=}}</ref>\n\nTrying to define environmental racism can be quite difficult. There are many different factors at play here. Different communities of people understand the different cross-scale interactions from different perspectives. This can make responding to crises challenging. Ryan Holifield from the Department of Geography at the University of Georgia argues that, \u201cWe must accept that people in different geographical, historical, political, and institutional contexts understand the terms differently. Instead of regarding the lack of universal definitions as a barrier to progress, however, we need to treat the breadth and multiplicity of interpretations as guides to more relevant and useful new research\u201d.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Holifield|first=Ryan|title=Defining Environmental Justice and Environmental Racism|date=2013-05-16|journal=Urban Geography|volume=22|pages=78\u201390|language=en|doi=10.2747/0272-3638.22.1.78|issn=0272-3638}}</ref> As Holifield suggests, these unique perspectives can be quite useful. There are so many different ideas present which can make coming up with solutions more feasible. With these large amounts of people to consider, communities of people are less likely to be left out since there is more representation. \n\nThere is also the consideration of the environmental justice movement coinciding with movements that benefit social justice. \u201cFor some persons race-based policies connect the environmental justice movement to social justice. Environmental issues afford us the opportunity to address many of the critical issues of the decade, including unemployment, community, and urban development, energy and defense policy, resource exploitation, public health, and self determination\u201d.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Westra|first=Laura|url=https://books.google.com/?id=uHPoATIWeZcC&pg=PR7&dq=policies+and+environmental+racism#v=onepage|title=Faces of Environmental Racism: Confronting Issues of Global Justice|last2=Lawson|first2=Bill|last3=Lawson|first3=Bill E.|last4=Wenz|first4=Peter S.|date=2001|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|isbn=978-0-7425-1249-8|language=en}}</ref>  These issues overlap and it gives people the opportunity to analyze what has been done and what needs to be accomplished in order to guarantee a brighter future for all people. \u00a0 \n\nThere are countless cases where citizens are not experiencing the equity of the environment. There are several different spatial levels where minorities have faced racism which keeps them pinned in difficult situations. \u201cThese are structural outcomes in so far as access, entitlements and life expectancy continue to be strongly shaped by people\u2019s racial identities. Most pertinently, the racial dimension of environmental inequality surfaces around the question of who has rights to environmental protection and who bears the burden of waste and pollution\u201d.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.amherst.edu/system/files/media/1304/race%252C%2520clas%252C%2520env%2520inequality.pdf|title=Race, Class and the Global Politics of Environmental Inequality|last=Newell|first=Peter|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> People's identities have fallen victim to structural racism and to factors out of their control. This is where environmental racism can rear its ugly head.\n\n== Climate Change and Environmental Racism ==\nAs the climate has changed progressively over the past several decades, there has been a collision between environmental racism and global climate change. The overlap of these two phenomena, many argue, has disproportionately affected different communities and populations throughout the world due to disparities in socio-economic status.<ref name=\":13\">{{Cite journal|last=Norgaard|first=Kari Marie|date=2012|title=Climate Denial and the Construction of Innocence: Reproducing Transnational Environmental Privilege in the Face of Climate Change|journal=Race, Gender & Class|volume=19|issue=1/2|pages=80\u2013103|jstor=43496861|issn=1082-8354}}</ref> This is especially true in the Global South where, for example, byproducts of global climate change such as increasingly frequent and severe landslides resulting from more heavy rainfall events in Quito, Ecuador force people to also deal with profound socio-economic ramifications like the destruction of their homes or even death.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Anguelovski|first=Isabelle|last2=Chu|first2=Eric|last3=Carmin|first3=JoAnn|date=July 2014|title=Variations in approaches to urban climate adaptation: Experiences and experimentation from the global South|journal=Global Environmental Change|language=en|volume=27|pages=156\u2013167|doi=10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2014.05.010}}</ref> Countries such as Ecuador often contribute relatively little to climate change in terms of metrics like carbon dioxide emissions but have far fewer resources to ward off the negative localized impacts of climate change. The argument is that places like these are made much more vulnerable than the main contributing countries, but not by their own doing. Some also claim a general attitude of apathy on the part of developed nations and the largest climate change contributors towards the disproportionate effects of their actions on those that contribute relatively much less.<ref name=\":13\" /> There may not be direct motives for actions that constitute environmental racism, but those citing environmental racism point to this alleged lack of accountability. Climate change in itself is not an actor directly targeting people of color throughout the world but when combined with the impacts of environmental racism, it acts as a multiplier for the total effect on the local socio-ecological system.\n\nWhile people living in the Global South have typically been impacted most by the effects of climate change, people of color in the Global North also face similar situations in several areas. The southeastern part of the United States has experienced a large amount of pollution and minority populations have been hit with the brunt of those impacts. \u201cToday, Louisiana\u2019s impoverished river communities are polluted by big oil and companies, creating the so-called \u201cCancer Alley\u201d. Pahokee, Florida, a town whose population is 56% African-American and 29% Hispanic, has had to confront the sugar industry, which polluted nearby Lake Okeechobee, endangering drinking water, fish safety, and property values. Paper mills have polluted Africatown, Alabama. Burlington Industries dumped cancer-causing PCBs in Cheraw, South Carolina. There's toxic coal ash in Uniontown, Alabama. The list goes on and on\u201d.<ref name=\"Bergman\">{{Cite news|last=Bergman|first=Megan Mayhew|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/mar/08/climate-changed-racism-environment-south|title='They chose us because we were rural and poor': when environmental racism and climate change collide|date=2019-03-08|work=The Guardian|access-date=2020-02-24|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}</ref> As explained, this list carries on to not only this region of the United States, but all across the country in various locations. \u201cAn estimated 70% of the country\u2019s contaminated waste sites are located near low-income housing, and an Associated Press analysis suggests 2 million people live within a mile of one of the 327 Superfund sites vulnerable to climate change-related flooding, most of them in low-income communities and communities of color\u201d.<ref name=\"Bergman\" />\n\nThe issues of climate change and communities that are in a danger zone are not limited to North America or the United States either. There are several communities around the world that face the same concern of industry and people who are dealing with its negative impacts in their areas. \u201ccommunities in Durban, South Africa to the plight of the Bay Area\u2019s Richmond communities, who live within a ring of five oil refineries, three chemical plants, eight Superfund sites, dozens of other toxic waste sites, highways, two rail yards, ports and marine terminals\u201d.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.goldmanprize.org/blog/environmental-racism-in-america-an-overview-of-the-environmental-justice-movement-and-the-role-of-race-in-environmental-policies/|title=Environmental Racism in America: An Overview of the Environmental Justice Movement and the Role of Race in Environmental Policies|date=2015-06-24|website=Goldman Environmental Foundation|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-24}}</ref> These are the concerns that various governments at different scales are having to confront.\n\nCommunities have already felt the impacts of industry and pollution. The future does not appear to be any brighter either. The global temperature has already risen and is expected to continue to do so. These communities that have already been burdened with health issues could expect to not experience protection as cities prepare to make changes to minimize carbon emissions and output. Grass root campaigns and climate justice movements have been a key voice for impoverished and minority groups. \u201cClimate justice focuses on local impacts and experience, inequitable vulnerabilities, the importance of community voice, and demands for community sovereignty and functioning\u201d.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Schlosberg|first=David|last2=Collins|first2=Lisette B.|date=2014|title=From environmental to climate justice: climate change and the discourse of environmental justice|journal=WIREs Climate Change|language=en|volume=5|issue=3|pages=359\u2013374|doi=10.1002/wcc.275|issn=1757-7799}}</ref> A focus on local impacts is vital for ensuring that all voices are heard and people can face the possible challenges of future climate change.\u00a0 \n\n== Background ==\nThe acknowledgement of environmental racism prompted the [[environmental justice]] social movement that began in the 1970s and 1980s in the United States.<ref>Melosi, Martin (1995). \"Equity, eco-racism and environmental history\".

Cheap land is sought by corporations and governmental bodies. Communities that cannot effectively resist and cannot access political power cannot negotiate just costs. Minimized socio-economic mobility cannot relocate. Lack of financial contribution also reduces the communities ability to act both physically and politically.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Park |first1=Rozelia |title=An Examination of International Environmental Racism Through the Lens of Transboundary Movement of Hazardous Wastes |journal=Indiana Journal of Global Legal Studies 659 (1998) |date=1998-04-01 |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=659\u2013709 |url=https://www.repository.law.indiana.edu/ijgls/vol5/iss2/14/|jstor=25691124}}</ref>\n\nChavis defined environmental racism in five categories: racial discrimination in defining environmental policies, discriminatory enforcement of regulations and laws, deliberate targeting of minority communities as hazardous waste dumping sites, official sanctioning of dangerous pollutants in minority communities, and exclusion of people of color from environmental leadership positions.<ref>Holifield, Ryan (2001). \"Defining Environmental Justice and Environmental Racism.\".

Accessed: November 20, 2011.</ref> Environmental CBA aims to provide policy solutions for intangible products such as clean air and water by measuring a consumer's willingness to pay for these goods. CBA contributes to environmental racism through the valuing of environmental resources based on their utility to society. The more someone is willing to pay for clean water or air financially benefits society more than when people are not willing to pay for these goods. This creates a burden on poor communities. Relocating toxic wastes is justified since they are not willing (or able) to pay as much as a wealthier area for a clean environment. The placement of toxic wastes near poor people lowers the property value of already cheap land. Since the decrease in property value is less than that of a cleaner and wealthier area, the monetary benefits to society are greater by dumping the toxic waste in a \"low-value\" area.<ref>Westra, Laura, and Bill E.

As a result of the Indian Removal Act of 1830, by 1850, all tribes east of the Mississippi had been removed to western lands, essentially confining them to \"lands that were too dry, remote, or barren to attract the attention of settlers and corporations\".<ref name=\"ibid\">{{cite journal|last1=Hooks|first1=Gregory|last2=Smith|first2=Chad L.|year=2004|title=The Treadmill of Destruction: National Sacrifice Areas and Native Americans|url=|journal=[[American Sociological Review]]|volume=69|issue=4|pages=558\u2013575|doi=10.1177/000312240406900405}}</ref>\n\nThere is evidence suggesting that Native Americans have undergone environmental racism from the actions of the United States military. Later, during World War II, military facilities were often located conterminous to reservations, leading to a situation in which \"a disproportionate number of the most dangerous military facilities are located near Native American lands\". A study analyzing the approximately 3,100 countries in the continental United States found that Native American lands are positively associated with the count of sites with unexploded ordnance deemed extremely dangerous.  The study also found that the risk assessment code (RAC) used to measure dangerousness of sites with unexploded ordnance can sometimes conceal how much of a threat these sites are to Native Americans. The hazard probability, or probability that a hazard will harm people or ecosystems, is sensitive to the proximity of public buildings such as schools and hospitals. These parameters neglect elements of tribal life such as subsistence consumption, ceremonial use of plants and animals, and low population densities.  Because these tribal-unique factors are not considered, Native American lands can often receive low-risk scores, despite threat to their way of life.  The hazard probability does not take Native Americans into account when considering the people or ecosystems that could be harmed. Locating military facilities coterminous to reservations lead to a situation in which \u201ca disproportionate number of the most dangerous military facilities are located near Native American lands\u201d.<ref name=\"ibid\" />\n\nMore recently, Native American lands have been used for waste disposal and illegal dumping by the US and multinational corporations.<ref name=\"Goldtooth, Tom 1995\">Goldtooth, Tom. \"Indigenous Nations: Summary of Sovereignty and Its Implications for Environmental Protection.\" Environmental justice issues, policies, and solutions.

The LES claimed to use an objective scientific method to select Louisiana as the \"best\" place to build the plant. In response to the selection, the communities of Homer, Forest Grove and Center Springs that are nearby the proposed site formed a group called Citizens against Nuclear Trash (CANT).

Finally after 8 years, on May 1, 1997, a three-judge panel of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission's Atomic Safety and Licensing Board made their final initial decision. The panel found that racial bias did play a role in the selection process.

Those in economically impoverished areas not only have to take on this responsibility, but there are numerous other challenges they face. Discrimination on the basis of gender, race, and class are all still present in South African culture. Because of this, women, who are the primary users of public resources in their work at home and for the community, are often excluded from any decision-making about control and access to public resources. The resulting energy poverty forces women to use sources of energy that are expensive and may be harmful both to their own health and that of the environment. Consequently, several renewable energy initiatives have emerged in South Africa specifically targeting these communities and women to correct this situation.<ref name=\":12\" />\n\n==Addressing environmental racism==\nEnvironmental Racism can be traced back around 500 years with the arrival of the Europeans and their displacement of Native Americans. \u00a0The [[Environmental justice|Environmental Justice Movement]], however, seems to be fairly recent having been rooted around the same time as the [[Civil rights movement|Civil Rights Movement]]. \u00a0The Civil Rights Movement influenced the mobilization of people by echoing the empowerment and concern associated with political action.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=R6rj8XMSjx4C&pg=PR11&dq=environmental+racism+outrage#v=onepage&q=environmental%20racism%20outrage&f=false|title=From the Ground Up: Environmental Racism and the Rise of the Environmental Justice Movement|last=Cole|first=Luke W.|last2=Foster|first2=Sheila R.|date=2001|publisher=NYU Press|isbn=9780814715376|language=en}}</ref> \u00a0Here is where the civil rights agenda and the environmental agenda met.

Procedural justice is a concept that dictates the use of fairness in the process of making decisions, especially when said decisions are being made in diplomatic situations such as the allocation of resources or the settling of disagreements. Procedural justice calls for a '''fair, transparent, impartial''' decision-making process with equal opportunity for all parties to voice their positions, opinions, and concerns.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cops.usdoj.gov/prodceduraljustice|title=PROCEDURAL JUSTICE {{!}} COPS OFFICE|website=cops.usdoj.gov|access-date=2020-03-17}}</ref> Rather than just focusing on the outcomes of agreements and the effects those outcomes have on affected populations and interest groups, procedural justice looks to involve all stakeholders throughout the process from planning through implementation. In terms of combating environmental racism, procedural justice helps to reduce the opportunities for powerful actors such as often-corrupt states or private entities to dictate the entire decision-making process and puts some power back into the hands of those who will be directly affected by the decisions being made.<ref name=\":15\" />\n\n=== Activism ===\nActivism efforts in the name of confronting environmental racism have taken several forms. One form involves activists organizing to perform collective demonstrations or protests, which can take place on a number of different levels from local to international.

However, despite President Bill Clinton's executive order 12898, there remains differences between policy and action that advocacy groups continue to address.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=White-Newsome|first=Jalonne Lynay|date=2016-07-02|title=A Policy Approach Toward Climate Justice|journal=The Black Scholar|language=en|volume=46|issue=3|pages=12\u201326|doi=10.1080/00064246.2016.1188353|issn=0006-4246}}</ref>\n\nWith time environmental justice and civil rights movements fused together and as a result environmental justice organizations stood up for more ethnic groups and this increased diversity within the organization. The fusion is very logical since the people who suffer the most are minority groups. One of the main environmental problems that minority groups suffer from is uncontrolled toxic wastes. The factor that initiated environmental justice is the relationship between the geography of minority groups and hazardous waste landfills.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://rdcu.be/bb1lL|title=Cities in the new millennium: Environmental justice, the spatialization of race, and combating anti-urbanism|website=rdcu.be|access-date=2018-11-26}}</ref>\n\n\n\nEfforts of activism have also been heavily influenced by women and the injustices they face from environmental racism. First, both environmental and women\u2019s activism are  intersectional issues. Women of different races, ethnicities, economic status, age, and gender are disproportionately affected by issues of environmental injustice. Additionally, the efforts made by women have historically been overlooked or challenged by efforts made by men, as the problems women face have been often avoided or ignored. One example still being seen today is the racism and its effects on indigenous peoples, specifically women. Winona LaDuke is one of many female activists working on environmental issues, in which she fights against injustices faced by indigenous communities. LaDuke was inducted into the National Women\u2019s Hall of Fame in 2007 for her continuous leadership towards justice. In 1994, LaDuke was nominated by Time magazine as one of America\u2019s fifty most promising leaders under forty years of age.  She was also awarded the Thomas Merton Award in 1996, and the Reebok Human Rights Award. LaDuke also founded The White Earth Land Recovery Project in 1989. The mission of the White Earth Land Recovery Project is to facilitate the recovery of the original land base of the White Earth Indian Reservation while preserving and restoring traditional practices of sound land stewardship, language fluency, community development, and strengthening spiritual and cultural heritage.\n\nWhen environmental racism became acknowledged in the US society, it stimulated the environmental justice social movement that gained wave throughout the 1970s and 1980s in the US. Historically, the term environmental racism has had ties with the environmental justice movement.\u00a0 However, this has changed with time to the extent it is believed to lack any associations with the movement. Grassroots organizations and campaigns have sprung up in response to this environmental racism with these groups mainly demanding the inclusion of minorities when it comes to policy making involving the environment. It is also worth noting that this concept is international despite being coined in the US. A perfect example is when the United States exported its hazardous wastes to the poor nations in the Global South because they knew that these countries had lax environmental regulations and safety practices. Marginalized communities are usually at risk of environmental racism because they resource and means to oppose the large companies that dump these dangerous wastes.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite journal|last=<!--editorial:no byline-->|date=2018|title=Environmental racism: time to tackle social injustice.|url=|journal=The Lancet Planetary Health|volume=2|issue=11|pages=e462|pmid=30396431|doi=10.1016/S2542-5196(18)30219-5}}</ref>\u00a0 As already stated, environmental racism is international, implying that it not only occurs in the United States.\n\n===Policies and international agreements===\nThe [[global waste trade|export of hazardous waste]] to third world countries is another growing concern. Between 1989 and 1994, an estimated 2,611 metric tons of hazardous waste was exported from Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries to non-OECD countries. Two international agreements were passed in response to the growing exportation of hazardous waste into their borders. The Organization of African Unity (OAU) was concerned that the Basel Convention adopted in March 1989 did not include a total ban on the trans-boundary movement on hazardous waste. In response to their concerns, on January 30, 1991, the Pan-African Conference on Environmental and Sustainable Development adopted the Bamako Convention banning the import of all hazardous waste into Africa and limiting their movement within the continent. In September 1995, the G-77 nations helped amend the Basel Convention to ban the export of all hazardous waste from industrial countries (mainly OECD countries and Lichtenstein) to other countries.<ref name=Bullard>{{cite web|last=Bullard |first=Robert |title=Confronting Environmental Racism in the Twenty-First Century |url=http://www.worlddialogue.org/content.php?id=179 |publisher=Global Dialogue |accessdate=November 19, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426041754/http://www.worlddialogue.org/content.php?id=179 |archivedate=April 26, 2012 }}</ref> A resolution was signed in 1988 by the Organization of African Unity (OAU) which declared toxic waste dumping to be a \u201ccrime against Africa and the African people\u201d.<ref name=\"Routledge\">{{Citation|chapter=The transboundary shipments of hazardous wastes|date=1998-04-23|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9780419218906|doi=10.4324/9780203476901.ch4|title=International Trade in Hazardous Wastes}}</ref> Soon after, the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) passed a resolution that allowed for penalties, such as life imprisonment, \u00a0to those who were caught dumping toxic wastes.<ref name=\"Routledge\"/>\n\nWith [[globalization]] and the increase in transnational agreements, introduce possibilities for cases of environmental racism.

This occurs because environmental justice is obviously aimed at creating safe, fair, and equal opportunity for communities and to ensure things like redlining do not occur. Robert Bullard's book Confronting Environmental Racism explains that, \u201cThe accumulation of toxic chemicals or \u2018intractable wastes\u2019; the intensification of ground, air, and water pollution generally; the growth in new diseases of affluence; the growth of urban and coastal high rise development; the dangers of nuclear plants and nuclear wastes; the growth in the nuclear arsenal; and the problem of global warming and the thinning of the ozone layer have posed increasing threats to human survival, safety, and well being\u201d.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Bullard|first=Robert D.|url=https://books.google.com/?id=yVr9lhrrTVwC&pg=PA1&dq=policies+and+environmental+racism#v=onepage|title=Confronting Environmental Racism: Voices from the Grassroots|date=1993|publisher=South End Press|isbn=978-0-89608-446-9|language=en}}</ref> With all of these unique elements in mind, there are serious ramifications for policy makers to consider when they make decisions. \n\nIn the United States, there has been some developing policies in various cities across the country. There has been a focus on municipality changes. \u201cLike state governments, municipalities can establish broad policies and programs with the purpose of furthering environmental justice, with a particular focus on land use policies\u201d.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nrdc.org/sites/default/files/local-policies-environmental-justice-national-scan-tishman-201902.pdf|title=LOCAL POLICIES FOR ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE: A NATIONAL SCAN|last=|first=|date=|website=The New School|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> These broad policies can achieve goals to get development started. Some cities and counties have taken advantage of environmental justice policies and applied it to the public health sector. \u201cIn Fulton County, Georgia, the Board of Commissioners voted to establish the Fulton County Environmental Justice Initiative in 2010. The county approved funding for an Environmental Health Planner position and began to collaborate with the Department of Health and Wellness on strategies to address public health issues using local tools (e.g., transportation, land use, solid waste disposal, water contamination, laws, ordinances, policies, and zoning)\u201d.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nrdc.org/sites/default/files/local-policies-environmental-justice-national-scan-tishman-201902.pdf|title=LOCAL POLICIES FOR ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE: A NATIONAL SCAN|last=|first=|date=|website=The New School|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> This is a solid step forward since many people who are trapped in poverty areas with high pollution are the most prone to contracting various health issues and concerns.

Charges of environmental racism can also prompt usages of civil rights legislation like the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] to prosecute [[environmental crime]]s in the areas in which racialized people live. Internationally, environmental racism can refer to the effects of the [[global waste trade]], like the negative health impact of the export of [[electronic waste in China|electronic waste to China]] from developed countries.\n\n== Definition ==\nThe term was coined by [[Benjamin Chavis]], previous executive director of the United Church of Christ (UCC) Commission for Racial Justice, addressing hazardous PCB waste in [[Warren County PCB Landfill|Warren County]], North Carolina.

'''9''' \u2013 via St. John's University School of Law.</ref>}}To truly understand the meaning of environmental racism, one must define each word. The term \u201cenvironment\u201d is a term that must be understood as it sets where everything takes place. The Environmental Justice Movement defines the environment as, \u201cWhere we live, work, play, learn and pray\u201d.<ref name=\"greenaction.org\">{{Cite web|url=http://greenaction.org/what-is-environmental-justice/|title=Environmental Justice & Environmental Racism \u2013 Greenaction for Health and Environmental Justice|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-24}}</ref> This definition by this movement demonstrates the broadness and multiple interacting levels that are at play here. There are large factions of people that all need equal access to work, recreation, education, religion, and safe neighborhoods to get the most out of their experience in their community. Environmental justice is what combats inequalities within these sectors. The Environmental Justice Movement explains that, \u201cEnvironmental Justice refers to those cultural norms and values, rules, regulations, behaviors, policies, and decisions to support sustainability, where all people can hold with confidence that their community and natural environment is safe and productive\u201d.<ref name=\"greenaction.org\"/> Citizens of every race and creed depend on being able to experience their cultures and values in a fair space. Environmental racism is a specific form of environmental injustice with which the underlying cause of said injustice is believed to be race-based. <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Fritz|first=Jan M.|date=1999|title=Searching for EnvironmentalJustice: National Stories,Global Possibilities|url=|journal=Social Justice|volume=26|pages=175|via=}}</ref>\n\nTrying to define environmental racism can be quite difficult. There are many different factors at play here. Different communities of people understand the different cross-scale interactions from different perspectives. This can make responding to crises challenging. Ryan Holifield from the Department of Geography at the University of Georgia argues that, \u201cWe must accept that people in different geographical, historical, political, and institutional contexts understand the terms differently. Instead of regarding the lack of universal definitions as a barrier to progress, however, we need to treat the breadth and multiplicity of interpretations as guides to more relevant and useful new research\u201d.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Holifield|first=Ryan|title=Defining Environmental Justice and Environmental Racism|date=2013-05-16|journal=Urban Geography|volume=22|pages=78\u201390|language=en|doi=10.2747/0272-3638.22.1.78|issn=0272-3638}}</ref> As Holifield suggests, these unique perspectives can be quite useful. There are so many different ideas present which can make coming up with solutions more feasible. With these large amounts of people to consider, communities of people are less likely to be left out since there is more representation. \n\nThere is also the consideration of the environmental justice movement coinciding with movements that benefit social justice. \u201cFor some persons race-based policies connect the environmental justice movement to social justice. Environmental issues afford us the opportunity to address many of the critical issues of the decade, including unemployment, community, and urban development, energy and defense policy, resource exploitation, public health, and self determination\u201d.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Westra|first=Laura|url=https://books.google.com/?id=uHPoATIWeZcC&pg=PR7&dq=policies+and+environmental+racism#v=onepage|title=Faces of Environmental Racism: Confronting Issues of Global Justice|last2=Lawson|first2=Bill|last3=Lawson|first3=Bill E.|last4=Wenz|first4=Peter S.|date=2001|publisher=Rowman & Littlefield|isbn=978-0-7425-1249-8|language=en}}</ref>  These issues overlap and it gives people the opportunity to analyze what has been done and what needs to be accomplished in order to guarantee a brighter future for all people. \u00a0 \n\nThere are countless cases where citizens are not experiencing the equity of the environment. There are several different spatial levels where minorities have faced racism which keeps them pinned in difficult situations. \u201cThese are structural outcomes in so far as access, entitlements and life expectancy continue to be strongly shaped by people\u2019s racial identities. Most pertinently, the racial dimension of environmental inequality surfaces around the question of who has rights to environmental protection and who bears the burden of waste and pollution\u201d.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.amherst.edu/system/files/media/1304/race%252C%2520clas%252C%2520env%2520inequality.pdf|title=Race, Class and the Global Politics of Environmental Inequality|last=Newell|first=Peter|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> People's identities have fallen victim to structural racism and to factors out of their control.

The overlap of these two phenomena, many argue, has disproportionately affected different communities and populations throughout the world due to disparities in socio-economic status.<ref name=\":13\">{{Cite journal|last=Norgaard|first=Kari Marie|date=2012|title=Climate Denial and the Construction of Innocence: Reproducing Transnational Environmental Privilege in the Face of Climate Change|journal=Race, Gender & Class|volume=19|issue=1/2|pages=80\u2013103|jstor=43496861|issn=1082-8354}}</ref> This is especially true in the Global South where, for example, byproducts of global climate change such as increasingly frequent and severe landslides resulting from more heavy rainfall events in Quito, Ecuador force people to also deal with profound socio-economic ramifications like the destruction of their homes or even death.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Anguelovski|first=Isabelle|last2=Chu|first2=Eric|last3=Carmin|first3=JoAnn|date=July 2014|title=Variations in approaches to urban climate adaptation: Experiences and experimentation from the global South|journal=Global Environmental Change|language=en|volume=27|pages=156\u2013167|doi=10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2014.05.010}}</ref> Countries such as Ecuador often contribute relatively little to climate change in terms of metrics like carbon dioxide emissions but have far fewer resources to ward off the negative localized impacts of climate change. The argument is that places like these are made much more vulnerable than the main contributing countries, but not by their own doing. Some also claim a general attitude of apathy on the part of developed nations and the largest climate change contributors towards the disproportionate effects of their actions on those that contribute relatively much less.<ref name=\":13\" /> There may not be direct motives for actions that constitute environmental racism, but those citing environmental racism point to this alleged lack of accountability. Climate change in itself is not an actor directly targeting people of color throughout the world but when combined with the impacts of environmental racism, it acts as a multiplier for the total effect on the local socio-ecological system.\n\nWhile people living in the Global South have typically been impacted most by the effects of climate change, people of color in the Global North also face similar situations in several areas. The southeastern part of the United States has experienced a large amount of pollution and minority populations have been hit with the brunt of those impacts. \u201cToday, Louisiana\u2019s impoverished river communities are polluted by big oil and companies, creating the so-called \u201cCancer Alley\u201d. Pahokee, Florida, a town whose population is 56% African-American and 29% Hispanic, has had to confront the sugar industry, which polluted nearby Lake Okeechobee, endangering drinking water, fish safety, and property values. Paper mills have polluted Africatown, Alabama. Burlington Industries dumped cancer-causing PCBs in Cheraw, South Carolina. There's toxic coal ash in Uniontown, Alabama.

Accessed: November 20, 2011.</ref> Environmental CBA aims to provide policy solutions for intangible products such as clean air and water by measuring a consumer's willingness to pay for these goods. CBA contributes to environmental racism through the valuing of environmental resources based on their utility to society. The more someone is willing to pay for clean water or air financially benefits society more than when people are not willing to pay for these goods. This creates a burden on poor communities. Relocating toxic wastes is justified since they are not willing (or able) to pay as much as a wealthier area for a clean environment. The placement of toxic wastes near poor people lowers the property value of already cheap land. Since the decrease in property value is less than that of a cleaner and wealthier area, the monetary benefits to society are greater by dumping the toxic waste in a \"low-value\" area.<ref>Westra, Laura, and Bill E.

Later, during World War II, military facilities were often located conterminous to reservations, leading to a situation in which \"a disproportionate number of the most dangerous military facilities are located near Native American lands\". A study analyzing the approximately 3,100 countries in the continental United States found that Native American lands are positively associated with the count of sites with unexploded ordnance deemed extremely dangerous.  The study also found that the risk assessment code (RAC) used to measure dangerousness of sites with unexploded ordnance can sometimes conceal how much of a threat these sites are to Native Americans. The hazard probability, or probability that a hazard will harm people or ecosystems, is sensitive to the proximity of public buildings such as schools and hospitals. These parameters neglect elements of tribal life such as subsistence consumption, ceremonial use of plants and animals, and low population densities.  Because these tribal-unique factors are not considered, Native American lands can often receive low-risk scores, despite threat to their way of life.  The hazard probability does not take Native Americans into account when considering the people or ecosystems that could be harmed. Locating military facilities coterminous to reservations lead to a situation in which \u201ca disproportionate number of the most dangerous military facilities are located near Native American lands\u201d.<ref name=\"ibid\" />\n\nMore recently, Native American lands have been used for waste disposal and illegal dumping by the US and multinational corporations.<ref name=\"Goldtooth, Tom 1995\">Goldtooth, Tom. \"Indigenous Nations: Summary of Sovereignty and Its Implications for Environmental Protection.\" Environmental justice issues, policies, and solutions.

Those in economically impoverished areas not only have to take on this responsibility, but there are numerous other challenges they face. Discrimination on the basis of gender, race, and class are all still present in South African culture. Because of this, women, who are the primary users of public resources in their work at home and for the community, are often excluded from any decision-making about control and access to public resources. The resulting energy poverty forces women to use sources of energy that are expensive and may be harmful both to their own health and that of the environment.

The movement gained traction with the help of Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, and Snapchat among other platforms. \u00a0Celebrities such as [[Shailene Woodley]], who advocated against the [[Keystone XL pipeline|Keystone XL Pipeline]], have shared their experiences including that of being arrested for protesting.

The US GAO study in response to the 1982 protests against the PCB landfill in Warren County was among the first groundbreaking studies that drew correlations between the racial and economic background of communities and the location of hazardous waste facilities. Their study, \"Siting of Hazardous Waste Landfills and Their Correlation with Racial and Economic Status of Surrounding Communities,\" revealed that \"three of the four commercial hazardous waste landfills in the Southeast United States were located in majority black communities.\" However, the study was limited in scope by only focusing on off-site hazardous waste landfills in the Southeastern United States.<ref name=\"autogenerated4\">Colquette and Robertson, 159.</ref> In response to this limitation the United Church of Christ Commission for Racial Justice, or CRJ, directed a comprehensive national study on demographic patterns associated with the location of hazardous waste sites.<ref name=\"autogenerated4\"/>\n\nThe CRJ national study conducted two examinations of areas surrounding commercial hazardous waste facilities and the location of uncontrolled toxic waste sites.<ref name=\"autogenerated4\"/> The first study examined the association between race and socio-economic status and the location of commercial hazardous waste treatment, storage, and disposal facilities.<ref name=\"autogenerated4\"/> After statistical analysis, the first study concluded that \"the percentage of community residents that belonged to a racial or ethnic group was a stronger predictor of the level of commercial hazardous waste activity than was household income, the value of the homes, the number of uncontrolled waste sites, or the estimated amount of hazardous wastes generated by industry\".<ref>Colquette and Robertson, 159-160.</ref> The second study examined the presence of uncontrolled toxic waste sites in ethnic and racial minority communities, and found that 3 out of every 5 African and Hispanic Americans lived in communities with uncontrolled waste sites.<ref>Colquette and Robertson, 159-161.</ref> Other studies like the 1987 \"Toxic Waste and Race in the United States\" by the Commission for Racial Justice found race to be the most influential variable in predicting where waste facilities were located.<ref name=\"Godsil\">{{cite journal|last=Godsil|first=Rachel D.|title=Remedying Environmental Racism|journal=[[Michigan Law Review]]|year=1991|volume=90|issue=2|pages=394\u2013395|doi=10.2307/1289559|jstor=1289559}}</ref>\n\nDeserting the Perpetrator - Victim Model of studying environmental justice issues, the Economic/Environmental Justice Model utilized a sharper lens to study the many complex factors, accompanied to race, that contributes to the act of environmental racism and injustice. Using this model the role of history and the overlapping of interest groups, stakeholders, and organizations are considered in case studies of environmental racism. For example, Lerner in ''Diamond: A struggle for Environmental Justice in Louisiana's Chemical Corridor'' <ref>{{Cite book|title=Diamond: A Struggle for Environmental Justice in Louisiana's Chemical Corridor (Urban and Industrial Environments)|last=Lerner|first=Steve|publisher=The MIT Press|year=2005|isbn=978-0-262-62204-2 |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|pages=}}</ref> not only revealed the role of race in the division of Diamond and Norco residents, but he also revealed the historical roles of the Shell Oil Company, the slave ancestry of Diamond residents, and of the history of white workers and families that were dependent upon the rewards of Shell. Involvement of outside organizations, such as the Bucket Brigade and Greenpeace, was also considered in the power that the Diamond community had when battling for environmental justice.\n\nIn wartimes, environmental racism can occur and are unearthed to the public through reports. Examining the [[Israeli\u2013Palestinian conflict|Israeli-Palestine conflict]], Friends of the Earth International's Environmental Nakba report brings attention to environmental racism that has occurred in the Gaza Strip. Some Israeli practices include cutting off three days of water supply to refugee Palestinians and destructing farms.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://edblogs.columbia.edu/scppx3335-001-2014-1/2014/04/02/beyond-the-us-borders-the-palestinian-israeli-case/#more-354|title=Beyond the US Borders: The Palestinian \u2013 Israeli Case {{!}} Environmental Leadership, Action and Ethics|website=edblogs.columbia.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-13}}</ref>\n\nBesides studies that point out cases of environmental racism, studies have also provided information on how to go about changing regulations and preventing environmental racism from happening. In a study by Daum, Stoler and Grant on e-waste management in Accra, Ghana, the importance of engaging with different fields and organizations such as recycling firms, communities, and scrap metal traders, to name a few are emphasized over adaptation strategies such as bans on burning and buy-back schemes that have not caused much effect on changing practices.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Daum|first=Kurt|last2=Stoler|first2=Justin|last3=Grant|first3=Richard J.|date=2017|title=Toward a More Sustainable Trajectory for E-Waste Policy: A Review of a Decade of E-Waste Research in Accra, Ghana|journal=International Journal of Environmental Research and Public Health|volume=14|issue=2|pages=135|doi=10.3390/ijerph14020135|issn=1661-7827|pmc=5334689|pmid=28146075}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=September 2013|title=Environmental Nakba|url=https://www.foei.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/06-foei-palestine-report-eng-lr.pdf|journal=Friends of the Earth International Report|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref>\n\nStudies have also shown that since environmental laws have become prominent in the U.S. as well as Europe so companies have moved their waste towards the global south. The Third World has less of a focus on environmental concerns and therefore are susceptible to more discriminatory practices. This has not stopped activism however it has limited the effects activism has on political restrictions. As these activists push on there are still companies destroying land in these countries with harmful chemicals that are cheaper to use.<ref name=\":15\">{{Cite journal | doi=10.1080/08941920802100721|title = Third World Environmental Justice| journal=Society & Natural Resources| volume=21| issue=7| pages=547\u2013555|year = 2008|last1 = Schroeder|first1 = Richard| last2=Martin| first2=Kevin St.| last3=Wilson| first3=Bradley| last4=Sen| first4=Debarati}}</ref>\n\n=== Procedural Justice ===\nCurrent political ideologies surrounding how to make right issues of environmental racism and environmental justice are shifting towards the idea of employing [[procedural justice]]. Procedural justice is a concept that dictates the use of fairness in the process of making decisions, especially when said decisions are being made in diplomatic situations such as the allocation of resources or the settling of disagreements. Procedural justice calls for a '''fair, transparent, impartial''' decision-making process with equal opportunity for all parties to voice their positions, opinions, and concerns.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cops.usdoj.gov/prodceduraljustice|title=PROCEDURAL JUSTICE {{!}} COPS OFFICE|website=cops.usdoj.gov|access-date=2020-03-17}}</ref> Rather than just focusing on the outcomes of agreements and the effects those outcomes have on affected populations and interest groups, procedural justice looks to involve all stakeholders throughout the process from planning through implementation. In terms of combating environmental racism, procedural justice helps to reduce the opportunities for powerful actors such as often-corrupt states or private entities to dictate the entire decision-making process and puts some power back into the hands of those who will be directly affected by the decisions being made.<ref name=\":15\" />\n\n=== Activism ===\nActivism efforts in the name of confronting environmental racism have taken several forms. One form involves activists organizing to perform collective demonstrations or protests, which can take place on a number of different levels from local to international. Additionally, in places where activists feel as though governmental solutions will work, organizations and individuals alike can pursue direct political action. In many cases, activists and organizations will form partnerships both regionally and internationally to gain more clout in pursuit of their goals.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Schroeder|first=Richard|last2=Martin|first2=Kevin St|last3=Wilson|first3=Bradley|last4=Sen|first4=Debarati|date=2008-07-15|title=Third World Environmental Justice|journal=Society & Natural Resources|volume=21|issue=7|pages=547\u2013555|doi=10.1080/08941920802100721|issn=0894-1920}}</ref>\n\nBefore the 1970s, communities of color recognized this reality and organized against it. For example, the [[Black Panther Party]] organized survival programs that confronted the inequitable distribution of trash in predominantly black neighborhoods.<ref>(1973). The Black Panther. Retrieved from http://www.itsabouttimebpp.com/Survival_Programs/pdf/Survival_Programs.pdf</ref> Similarly, the [[Young Lords]], a Puerto Rican revolutionary nationalist organization based in Chicago and New York City, protested pollution and toxic refuse present in their community via their Garbage Offensive program. These and other organizations also worked to confront the maldistribution of open spaces, toxic lead paint, and healthy food options.<ref name=\"Enck-Wanzer, D. 2010\">Enck-Wanzer, D. (2010). ''The Young Lords: A Reader''. New York: New York University Press</ref> They also offered health programs to those affected by preventable, environmentally induced diseases such as tuberculosis.<ref name=\"Enck-Wanzer, D. 2010\" />\nIn this way, these organizations serve as precursors to more pointed movements against environmental racism.\n\n[[Martin Luther King Jr.|Martin Luther King Jr]]. helped to bring light to the injustices done to many low-income neighborhoods and the working conditions of African-Americans. In the year before his assassination, [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] was in the midst of organizing a protest in Washington to create a bill to help the poor and homeless in the United States. After his assassination \u00a0and even with the push of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC), this bill would never come to pass.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.yahoo.com/news/martin-luther-king-jr---8-peaceful-protests-that-bolstered-civil-rights.html|title=Martin Luther King Jr.: 8 peaceful protests that bolstered civil rights|access-date=2018-10-16|language=en-US}}</ref> Latino ranch laborers composed by Cesar Chavez battled for working environment rights, including insurance from harmful pesticides in the homestead fields of California's San Joaquin Valley. In 1967, African-American understudies rioted in the streets of Houston to battle a city trash dump in their locale which had killed two kids. In 1968, occupants of West Harlem, in New York City, battled unsuccessfully against the siting of a sewage treatment plant in their neighborhood.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nrdc.org/stories/environmental-justice-movement|title=The Environmental Justice Movement|work=NRDC|access-date=2018-10-16|language=en}}</ref>\n\nOne approach in activism is promoting the development and manufacturing of renewable energy sources and the integration of health, economic and preparedness issues into climate policies. However, despite President Bill Clinton's executive order 12898, there remains differences between policy and action that advocacy groups continue to address.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=White-Newsome|first=Jalonne Lynay|date=2016-07-02|title=A Policy Approach Toward Climate Justice|journal=The Black Scholar|language=en|volume=46|issue=3|pages=12\u201326|doi=10.1080/00064246.2016.1188353|issn=0006-4246}}</ref>\n\nWith time environmental justice and civil rights movements fused together and as a result environmental justice organizations stood up for more ethnic groups and this increased diversity within the organization. The fusion is very logical since the people who suffer the most are minority groups. One of the main environmental problems that minority groups suffer from is uncontrolled toxic wastes. The factor that initiated environmental justice is the relationship between the geography of minority groups and hazardous waste landfills.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://rdcu.be/bb1lL|title=Cities in the new millennium: Environmental justice, the spatialization of race, and combating anti-urbanism|website=rdcu.be|access-date=2018-11-26}}</ref>\n\n\n\nEfforts of activism have also been heavily influenced by women and the injustices they face from environmental racism. First, both environmental and women\u2019s activism are  intersectional issues. Women of different races, ethnicities, economic status, age, and gender are disproportionately affected by issues of environmental injustice. Additionally, the efforts made by women have historically been overlooked or challenged by efforts made by men, as the problems women face have been often avoided or ignored. One example still being seen today is the racism and its effects on indigenous peoples, specifically women. Winona LaDuke is one of many female activists working on environmental issues, in which she fights against injustices faced by indigenous communities. LaDuke was inducted into the National Women\u2019s Hall of Fame in 2007 for her continuous leadership towards justice. In 1994, LaDuke was nominated by Time magazine as one of America\u2019s fifty most promising leaders under forty years of age.  She was also awarded the Thomas Merton Award in 1996, and the Reebok Human Rights Award. LaDuke also founded The White Earth Land Recovery Project in 1989. The mission of the White Earth Land Recovery Project is to facilitate the recovery of the original land base of the White Earth Indian Reservation while preserving and restoring traditional practices of sound land stewardship, language fluency, community development, and strengthening spiritual and cultural heritage.\n\nWhen environmental racism became acknowledged in the US society, it stimulated the environmental justice social movement that gained wave throughout the 1970s and 1980s in the US. Historically, the term environmental racism has had ties with the environmental justice movement.\u00a0 However, this has changed with time to the extent it is believed to lack any associations with the movement. Grassroots organizations and campaigns have sprung up in response to this environmental racism with these groups mainly demanding the inclusion of minorities when it comes to policy making involving the environment. It is also worth noting that this concept is international despite being coined in the US. A perfect example is when the United States exported its hazardous wastes to the poor nations in the Global South because they knew that these countries had lax environmental regulations and safety practices. Marginalized communities are usually at risk of environmental racism because they resource and means to oppose the large companies that dump these dangerous wastes.<ref name=\":7\">{{Cite journal|last=<!--editorial:no byline-->|date=2018|title=Environmental racism: time to tackle social injustice.|url=|journal=The Lancet Planetary Health|volume=2|issue=11|pages=e462|pmid=30396431|doi=10.1016/S2542-5196(18)30219-5}}</ref>\u00a0 As already stated, environmental racism is international, implying that it not only occurs in the United States.\n\n===Policies and international agreements===\nThe [[global waste trade|export of hazardous waste]] to third world countries is another growing concern. Between 1989 and 1994, an estimated 2,611 metric tons of hazardous waste was exported from Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries to non-OECD countries. Two international agreements were passed in response to the growing exportation of hazardous waste into their borders. The Organization of African Unity (OAU) was concerned that the Basel Convention adopted in March 1989 did not include a total ban on the trans-boundary movement on hazardous waste. In response to their concerns, on January 30, 1991, the Pan-African Conference on Environmental and Sustainable Development adopted the Bamako Convention banning the import of all hazardous waste into Africa and limiting their movement within the continent. In September 1995, the G-77 nations helped amend the Basel Convention to ban the export of all hazardous waste from industrial countries (mainly OECD countries and Lichtenstein) to other countries.<ref name=Bullard>{{cite web|last=Bullard |first=Robert |title=Confronting Environmental Racism in the Twenty-First Century |url=http://www.worlddialogue.org/content.php?id=179 |publisher=Global Dialogue |accessdate=November 19, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426041754/http://www.worlddialogue.org/content.php?id=179 |archivedate=April 26, 2012 }}</ref> A resolution was signed in 1988 by the Organization of African Unity (OAU) which declared toxic waste dumping to be a \u201ccrime against Africa and the African people\u201d.<ref name=\"Routledge\">{{Citation|chapter=The transboundary shipments of hazardous wastes|date=1998-04-23|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9780419218906|doi=10.4324/9780203476901.ch4|title=International Trade in Hazardous Wastes}}</ref> Soon after, the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) passed a resolution that allowed for penalties, such as life imprisonment, \u00a0to those who were caught dumping toxic wastes.<ref name=\"Routledge\"/>\n\nWith [[globalization]] and the increase in transnational agreements, introduce possibilities for cases of environmental racism. For example, the 1994 [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA) attracted US-owned factories to Mexico, where toxic waste was abandoned in the Colonia Chilpancingo community and was not cleaned up until activists called for the Mexican government to clean up the waste.<ref name=\":1\">{{cite journal|last=Mohai|first=Paul|author2=Pellow, David|author3=Roberts, J.

For example, the CRA was used in the 1994 lawsuit against the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transit Authority which failed to provide services for poor LA County residents.<ref name=\":6\" /> In Canada, progress is being made to address environmental racism (especially in Nova Scotia's [[Africville]] community) with the passing of Bill 111, An Act to Address Environmental Racism in the Nova Scotia Legislature.<ref name=\":6\" />\n\nIn response to fatal diesel pollution in the air around ports in Los Angeles and Long Beach in 2006, the San Pedro Bay Ports Clean Air Action Plan, or CAAP, was passed.<ref>Juan De Lara (2018) [https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/24694452.2017.1393328 \u201cThis Port Is Killing People\u201d]: Sustainability without Justice in the Neo-Keynesian Green City, Annals of the American Association of Geographers, 108:2, 538-548, {{DOI| 10.1080/24694452.2017.1393328}}</ref> The action plan was created to reduce pollution caused by ports; specifically, it demanded a 45% decrease in pollution once the proposal was put into action.<ref name=\"De Lara 2017, p. 540\">De Lara 2017, p. 540.</ref> Another layer of the plan's objective was to reduce negative environmental impacts from trucks with the initial plans for the Clean Truck Program (CTP), which intended to cut back on the use of shipping trucks from the docks and instead called for purer options like rail yards and warehouses that could hopefully improve the air quality.<ref name=\"De Lara 2017, p. 540\"/>\n\nEnvironmental justice movements have grown to become an important part of world summits. This issue is gathering attention and features a wide array of people, workers, and levels of society that are working together. \u201cThe issue of globalization is one of common concern to the environmental justice movement in many developing countries,\u201d says Michelle DePass, program officer of the Environmental Justice and Healthy Communities Program at the Ford Foundation. Concerns about globalization can bring together a wide range of stakeholders including workers, academics, and community leaders for whom increased industrial development is a common denominator\u201d.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Claudio|first=Luz|date=October 2007|title=Standing on Principle: The Global Push for Environmental Justice|journal=Environmental Health Perspectives|volume=115|issue=10|pages=A500\u2013A503|issn=0091-6765|pmc=2022674|pmid=17938719|doi=10.1289/ehp.115-a500}}</ref>\n\nMany policies can be expounded based on the state of human welfare. This occurs because environmental justice is obviously aimed at creating safe, fair, and equal opportunity for communities and to ensure things like redlining do not occur. Robert Bullard's book Confronting Environmental Racism explains that, \u201cThe accumulation of toxic chemicals or \u2018intractable wastes\u2019; the intensification of ground, air, and water pollution generally; the growth in new diseases of affluence; the growth of urban and coastal high rise development; the dangers of nuclear plants and nuclear wastes; the growth in the nuclear arsenal; and the problem of global warming and the thinning of the ozone layer have posed increasing threats to human survival, safety, and well being\u201d.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Bullard|first=Robert D.|url=https://books.google.com/?id=yVr9lhrrTVwC&pg=PA1&dq=policies+and+environmental+racism#v=onepage|title=Confronting Environmental Racism: Voices from the Grassroots|date=1993|publisher=South End Press|isbn=978-0-89608-446-9|language=en}}</ref> With all of these unique elements in mind, there are serious ramifications for policy makers to consider when they make decisions. \n\nIn the United States, there has been some developing policies in various cities across the country. There has been a focus on municipality changes. \u201cLike state governments, municipalities can establish broad policies and programs with the purpose of furthering environmental justice, with a particular focus on land use policies\u201d.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nrdc.org/sites/default/files/local-policies-environmental-justice-national-scan-tishman-201902.pdf|title=LOCAL POLICIES FOR ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE: A NATIONAL SCAN|last=|first=|date=|website=The New School|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> These broad policies can achieve goals to get development started. Some cities and counties have taken advantage of environmental justice policies and applied it to the public health sector. \u201cIn Fulton County, Georgia, the Board of Commissioners voted to establish the Fulton County Environmental Justice Initiative in 2010. The county approved funding for an Environmental Health Planner position and began to collaborate with the Department of Health and Wellness on strategies to address public health issues using local tools (e.g., transportation, land use, solid waste disposal, water contamination, laws, ordinances, policies, and zoning)\u201d.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nrdc.org/sites/default/files/local-policies-environmental-justice-national-scan-tishman-201902.pdf|title=LOCAL POLICIES FOR ENVIRONMENTAL JUSTICE: A NATIONAL SCAN|last=|first=|date=|website=The New School|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> This is a solid step forward since many people who are trapped in poverty areas with high pollution are the most prone to contracting various health issues and concerns. With spending geared towards public health, people are getting the attention they need to combat the problems that face their communities. \n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=22em}}\n* [[Antiziganism#Environmental struggles]]\n* [[Bhopal disaster]]\n* [[Cancer Alley]]\n* [[Climate change and poverty]]\n* [[Economic inequality]]\n* [[Eco-terrorism]]\n* [[Electronic waste]]\n* [[Environmental inequality in the United Kingdom]]\n* [[Environmental justice]]\n* [[Environmental policy of the United States]]\n* [[Environmental inequality in Europe]]\n* [[Internalized racism]] \n* [[NIMBY]]\n* [[Environmental dumping]]\n* [[Hawks Nest Tunnel Disaster]]\n* [[Health inequality and environmental influence]]\n* [[Public health problems in the Aral Sea region]]\n* [[Intergenerational equity]]\n* [[Planned shrinkage]]: the deliberate removal of city services from impoverished neighborhoods\n* [[Pollution in the United States#Environmental Discrimination]]\n* [[Race and health]]\n* [[Social inequality]]\n* [[Triangle of death (Italy)|Triangle of Death]]\n* [[Uranium mining and the Navajo people]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|colwidth=30em}}\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.epa.gov/oecaerth/environmentaljustice/ United States Environmental Protection Agency - Environmental Justice]\n* [http://www.ejnet.org/ej/ Environmental Justice and Environmental Racism]\n* [https://www.empathyworksfilms.net/future-projects] Marathon for Justice, 2016 - Film on Environmental Racism\n\n{{Environmental social science}}\n{{Racism topics}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Environmental Racism}}\n[[Category:Environmental controversies]]\n[[Category:Definition of racism controversy]]\n[[Category:Urban decay]]\n[[Category:Environmental justice| ]]\n[[Category:Environmental social science concepts]]\n[[Category:Environment and society]]\n", "name_user": "Rjwilmsi", "label": "safe", "comment": "Journal cites:, templated 4 journal cites", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Environmental_racism"}
