[[n-Butyllithium]] undergoes a [[Organolithium reagent|halogen-lithium exchange]] reaction with the bromide at {{convert|-78|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} to yield the intermediate '''c'''.

After quenching the reaction in a weakly acidic aqueous solution, a mixture of 1: 1 [[anomer]]s was obtained. It was then reacted with an excess of [[trimethylsilyl cyanide]] in dichloromethane at {{convert|-78|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} for 10 minutes. [[Trimethylsilyl triflate]] was added and reacts for one additional hour, and the mixture was quenched in an aqueous sodium hydrogen carbonate. A [[nitrile]] intermediate was obtained. The protective group, benzyl, was then removed with [[boron trichloride]] in dichloromethane at {{convert|-20|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}}. The excess of boron trichloride was quenched in a mixture of potassium carbonate and methanol. A benzyl-free intermediate was obtained.

Unlike many maritime patrol aircraft, which are typically conversions of civilian designs, the P-1 is a purpose-built maritime aircraft with no civil counterpart and was designed from the onset for the role. It has the distinction of being the first operational aircraft in the world to make use of a [[fly-by-light]] control system.\n\nThe P-1 has entered service with the [[Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force]] (JMSDF) as a replacement for the [[Lockheed P-3|P-3C Orion]]. On 26 March 2013, the JMSDF took delivery of the first two operational P-1 aircraft.<ref name=\"japantimes.co.jp\"/> Export customers are also being sought for the type as part of a general loosening of Japanese [[Japanese Arms Export Ban|military export restrictions]].\n\n==Development==\nObserving that its fleet of [[P-3C Orion|P-3C]] aircraft had been in service for some time, the JMSDF began searching for a replacement maritime patrol aircraft. Since other similar aircraft produced abroad did not meet the JMSDF's requirements, the development of a purpose-built indigenous aircraft became necessary. The Japanese Defense Agency (JDA) submitted the domestic development of a P-X maritime patrol aircraft as part of its April 2001 \u2013 March 2006 Five-Year Defense Plan.<ref name=\"skyhigh\">[http://www.khi.co.jp/scope/pdf_e/scope73.pdf \"Sky-High Expectations for Japan's P-X and C-X Aircraft.\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605233419/http://www.khi.co.jp/scope/pdf_e/scope73.pdf# |date=2011-06-05 }} ''Kawasaki Heavy Industries Scope Quarterly Newsletter'', No.73.

Unlike many maritime patrol aircraft, which are typically conversions of civilian designs, the P-1 is a purpose-built maritime aircraft with no civil counterpart and was designed from the onset for the role. It has the distinction of being the first operational aircraft in the world to make use of a [[fly-by-light]] control system.\n\nThe P-1 has entered service with the [[Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force]] (JMSDF) as a replacement for the [[Lockheed P-3|P-3C Orion]]. On 26 March 2013, the JMSDF took delivery of the first two operational P-1 aircraft.<ref name=\"japantimes.co.jp\"/> Export customers are also being sought for the type as part of a general loosening of Japanese [[Japanese Arms Export Ban|military export restrictions]].\n\n==Development==\nObserving that its fleet of [[P-3C Orion|P-3C]] aircraft had been in service for some time, the JMSDF began searching for a replacement maritime patrol aircraft. Since other similar aircraft produced abroad did not meet the JMSDF's requirements, the development of a purpose-built indigenous aircraft became necessary.
