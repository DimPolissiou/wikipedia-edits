Part of the [[Central Volcanic Zone]] of the Andes, it is a volcano collapse structure located at an altitude of {{convert|4670|m}} in a depression. The caldera is associated with a less well defined caldera to the south and several [[lava dome]]s.\n\nThe caldera has been active for the last eight million years and eruptions have created several [[ignimbrite]]s.{{efn|Ignimbrites are volcanic deposits that consist of [[pumice]] embedded in ash and crystals, and which are deposited by [[pyroclastic flow]]s.{{sfn|de Silva|Bailey|Mandt|Viramonte|2010|p=461}}}} A recent eruption occurred 73,000 years ago and formed the Campo de la Piedra P\u00f3mez ignimbrite layer. About 2,300 \u00b1 160 BCE,<ref name=GVP /> the largest volcanic eruption of the Central Andes with a [[volcanic explosivity index|VEI]] 7 occurred at Cerro Blanco, forming the most recent caldera as well as thick ignimbrite layers. Over {{convert|170|km3}} of [[tephra]] were erupted then. The volcano is dormant since then with some deformation and geothermal activity. A major future eruption would put local communities to the south at risk.\n\nThe volcano is also known for giant [[ripple marks]] that have formed on its ignimbrite fields. Persistent wind action on the ground has shifted gravel and sand, forming wave-like structures. These ripple marks have heights up to {{convert|1|m}} and are separated by distances up to {{convert|30|m}}. Unlike [[dune]]s, they do not migrate with the wind and are stationary.

Part of the [[Central Volcanic Zone]] of the Andes, it is a volcano collapse structure located at an altitude of {{convert|4670|m}} in a depression. The caldera is associated with a less well defined caldera to the south and several [[lava dome]]s.\n\nThe caldera has been active for the last eight million years and eruptions have created several [[ignimbrite]]s.{{efn|Ignimbrites are volcanic deposits that consist of [[pumice]] embedded in ash and crystals, and which are deposited by [[pyroclastic flow]]s.{{sfn|de Silva|Bailey|Mandt|Viramonte|2010|p=461}}}} A recent eruption occurred 73,000 years ago and formed the Campo de la Piedra P\u00f3mez ignimbrite layer. About 2,300 \u00b1 160 BCE,<ref name=GVP /> the largest volcanic eruption of the Central Andes with a [[volcanic explosivity index|VEI]] 7 occurred at Cerro Blanco, forming the most recent caldera as well as thick ignimbrite layers. Over {{convert|170|km3}} of [[tephra]] were erupted then. The volcano is dormant since then with some deformation and geothermal activity. A major future eruption would put local communities to the south at risk.\n\nThe volcano is also known for giant [[ripple marks]] that have formed on its ignimbrite fields. Persistent wind action on the ground has shifted gravel and sand, forming wave-like structures. These ripple marks have heights up to {{convert|1|m}} and are separated by distances up to {{convert|30|m}}. Unlike [[dune]]s, they do not migrate with the wind and are stationary. These ripple marks are among the most extreme on Earth and have been compared to [[Mars|Martian]] ripple marks by geologists.\n\n== Geography and geomorphology ==\n\nThe caldera lies at the southern margin of the Argentine [[Altiplano|Puna]]{{efn|The [[Altiplano]]-Puna is the second-largest [[high plateau]] on Earth after the [[Tibetan Plateau]] and consists of a number of [[mountain range]]s separated by valleys with [[closed drainage]].{{sfn|Montero L\u00f3pez|Hongn|Seggiaro|Marrett|2009|p=138}} }},{{sfn|Kay|Coira|Mpodozis|2006|p=499}} on the border between the [[Antofagasta de la Sierra Department]] and the [[Tinogasta Department]]{{sfn|Ratto|Rodr\u00edguez Gonz\u00e1lez|Basile|P\u00e9rez Torrado|2018|p=76}} in the [[Catamarca Province]] of Argentina.{{sfn|Fernandez-Turiel|Perez\u2013Torrado|Rodriguez-Gonzalez|Saavedra|2019|p=3}} [[Trail]]s run through the area,{{sfn|Milana|2009|p=343}} and there are abandoned [[mining]] operations.{{sfn|Milana|2009|p=344}} [[Provincial Route 34 (Catamarca)]] between [[Fiambal\u00e1]] and [[Antofagasta de la Sierra]] runs past Cerro Blanco.{{sfn|Montero L\u00f3pez|Hongn|Seggiaro|Marrett|2009|p=140}} The volcano is sometimes known as Cerro Blanco and sometimes as Robledo,{{sfn|Pritchard|Simons|2004|p=10}} with the latter name used by the [[Smithsonian Institution]].{{sfn|Brunori|Bignami|Stramondo|Bustos|2013|p=279}}\n\n=== Calderas and lava domes ===\n\nCerro Blanco lies at an elevation of {{convert|3500|-|4700|m}} and consists of four nested calderas{{sfn|Fernandez-Turiel|Perez\u2013Torrado|Rodriguez-Gonzalez|Saavedra|2019|pp=4-5}} with discontinuous borders,{{sfn|Seggiaro|Hongn|Castillo|Pereyra|2006|p=27}} fallout deposits, [[lava dome]]s{{sfn|Brunori|Bignami|Stramondo|Bustos|2013|p=281}} and [[pyroclastic]] deposits.{{sfn|Chiodi|Tassi|B\u00e1ez|Filipovich|2019|p=2}} The two inconspicuous El Ni\u00f1o and Pie de San Buenaventura calderas are nested in the northern part of the complex{{sfn|Fernandez-Turiel|Perez\u2013Torrado|Rodriguez-Gonzalez|Saavedra|2019|pp=4-5}} and form a {{convert|15|km}} wide depression.{{sfn|Montero L\u00f3pez|Hongn|Seggiaro|Marrett|2009|p=140}} Only their northern margins are recognizable in satellite images; their southern parts are filled with [[block and ash flow]]s from the southern calderas.

{"title_page": "Birmingham and Gloucester Railway", "text_new": "{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2017}}\n{{Use British English|date=January 2017}}\n\nThe '''Birmingham and Gloucester Railway''' (B&GR) was the first name of the railway linking the cities in its name and of the company which pioneered and developed it; the line opened in stages in 1840, using a terminus at Camp Hill in Birmingham. It linked with the [[Bristol and Gloucester Railway]] in Gloucester, but at first that company's line was [[Brunel gauge|broad gauge]], and Gloucester was a point of the necessary but inconvenient transhipment of goods and passengers onto {{Track gauge|uksg}} gauge that became the national standard.  Nearly all of the original main line remains active as a \"trunk\" route, also known as an arterial route or line.\n\nIts main line incorporated the [[Lickey Incline]] {{convert|2|mi|km}} of track climbing a 1-in-37 (2.7%) gradient, northbound (and descending in the other). The climb was a challenge or impediment for many of the heaviest loads and weaker engines during the era of steam traction.\n\nHaving attracted its own patronage, capital and accomplished fully functional transformation and employment of land, buildings, labour force and rolling stock in 1846, it was acquired by the Midland Railway.\n\n==First proposals==\n[[File:Brum&glos.png|thumb|The Birmingham and Gloucester Railway system in 1845]]The idea for a railway line between [[Bristol]] and [[Birmingham]] was put forward during the construction of the [[Stockton and Darlington Railway]]. 78,000 tons of goods were conveyed from Birmingham to Bristol annually, a journey that took nearly a week, and the cost of the journey was high. At a meeting in Bristol on 13 December 1824 subscriptions were taken for a proposed ''Bristol, Northern and Western Railway''.<ref name = long>P J Long and W V Awdry, ''The Birmingham and Gloucester Railway'', Alan Sutton Publishing, Gloucester, 1987, {{ISBN|0 86299 329 6}}</ref> Investors, among which wealthy venture capitalists, were enthusiasts of the scheme and before the fund promoters' prospectus meeting closed, all the 16,000 shares allocated to Bristol were taken up. A further 9,000 shares were created, the subscription fee and paying-up of which was allocated to other locations, and the total amounted to \u00a3{{frac|1|1|4}} million ({{Inflation|GBP|1250000|1824|r=-3|fmt=eq|cursign=\u00a3}}), in an era when cheap and plentiful labourers' and professional work would have enabled the construction of thousands of houses or road modifications (e.g. regular bridges) for such a sum. The company surveyed the route in 1825 but there was a [[Panic of 1826|financial crisis in 1826]] in which investors asked for the project to be suspended, which the company did.<ref name = maggs-bham>Colin Maggs, ''The Birmingham Gloucester Line'', Line One Publishing Limited, Cheltenham, 1986, {{ISBN|0-907036-10-4}}</ref><ref name = rake1>Herbert Rake, ''The South-western Extension of the Midland Railway: the Birmingham and Gloucester Railway: part 1'', in the Railway Magazine, February 1904</ref><ref name = barnes>E G Barnes, ''The Rise of the Midland Railway, 1844-1874'', George Allen & Unwin Ltd, London, Chapter 5</ref>\n\nIn 1832 the company advanced a new scheme; [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]] was asked to survey a cheap route between Birmingham and [[Gloucester]]. He avoided the barrier of the [[Lickey Hills]] and his maximum gradient would have been 1 in 300. This scheme too failed to make progress due to lack of funds.<ref name = long/><ref name = christiansen7>Rex Christiansen, ''A Regional History of the Railways of Great Britain: volume 7: the West Midlands'', David & Charles, Newton Abbot, 1973, {{ISBN|0 7153 6093 0}}</ref>\n\n==Birmingham and Gloucester Railway proposed==\nThe idea was revived when in 1834 [[William Moorsom|Captain W S Moorsom]] was engaged to survey a route; once again economy was considered to be essential, and his route avoided large towns thus lowered cost of the land. By-passed townspeople expressed disappointment and [[Cheltenham]] was particularly vocal. Moorsom modified his intended route to provide it a station, but that was not considered convenient for the centre of the town, and a branch line was proposed. When the B&GR promoters refused to contemplate the expense of that, [[Pearson Thompson]], a prominent Cheltenham resident and a member of the Gloucester Committee of the B&GR, offered to build it himself at his own expense.<ref name = long/>\n\nAround Birmingham local politics and geographic factors proved easier; a connection to the [[London and Birmingham Railway]] close to the nascent city was agreed, moreover, L&BR agreed to shared use of their [[Birmingham Curzon Street railway station (1838-1966)|Curzon Street station]] on payment of a toll. As well as giving a direct connection to London, and over the [[Grand Junction Railway]] to the north west of England, this avoided the expense of constructing a new terminus in the city.<ref name = long/>\n\nMoorsom estimated the cost of construction to be \u00a3920,000.<ref name = long/> Moorsom's route did climb the [[Lickey Ridge]] directly, involving a long climb. This was divided into two sections: {{frac|1|1|4}} miles at 1 in 54 worked by a 96&nbsp;hp stationary engine, and {{frac|1|1|4}} miles at 1 in 36 worked by a 121&nbsp;hp machine. there was also to be an inclined plane at Gloucester to reach a goods depot at the canal, and another at the connecting line to the L&BR in Birmingham, at 1 in 84.<ref name = long/>\n\nIn the 1836 session of Parliament, the [[Cheltenham and Great Western Union Railway]]'s plans were likewise considered, and between Gloucester and Cheltenham the two companies proposed almost identical routing. They came to an arrangement by which they would collaborate in the construction. The line between Gloucester and Cheltenham was to be divided, the Cheltenham end being built by the Birmingham company and the Gloucester end by the C&GWUR. Each would build one of the stations and both would have freedom to run over the whole line and use both the stations. The means of dealing with the complexity of the different gauges was not fully specified at first.<ref name = long/><ref name = maggs-c&gwur>Colin G Maggs, ''The Swindon to Gloucester Line'', Alan Sutton Publishing Limited, Stroud, 1991, {{ISBN|0 7509 0000 8}}, pages 6 to 31</ref>\n\nA functional plateway tramroad ran between the two: the [[Gloucester and Cheltenham Tramroad]]{{efn|In its authorising Act of Parliament the company was referred to as the Gloucester and Cheltenham Railway.}} that opened in 1810. As well as connecting the two, it had an important branch to quarries at Leckhampton, in the hills south of Cheltenham and terminus at the Gloucester docks. Stone for house building was in demand at the time. Acquisition of the tramroad was sought by the B&GR and the C&GWUR; its alignment was unsuitable for a main line railway but its dock trade and access were very attractive. The collaborative approach to building the new main line extended to the issue of acquiring the tramroad, and it was agreed to do so jointly, for the sum of \u00a335,000.<ref name = bick>David Bick, ''The Gloucester & Cheltenham Tramroad and the Leckhampton Quarry Lines'', Oakwood Press, Usk, second edition 1987, {{ISBN|0 85361 336 2}}</ref><ref name = long/>\n\n==Authorisation==\n[[File:Lickey bank.png|thumb|The Lickey Incline about 1845]]\nAt this stage the line was conceived as a toll railway (on which independent carriers would run trains, paying the B&GR a toll for that right). The railway received [[Royal Assent|final approval of its Parliamentary Act]] on 22 April 1836, with authorised capital of \u00a3950,000.<ref name = long/><ref name = rake1/><ref name = barnes/>\n\nOpinion among the Parliamentary Borough of [[Worcester]]'s elite and businesses was strong for a much closer line. To assuage fear of other railway company competition, the B&GR agreed to provide it a branch line, from Abbotswood in the county. Similarly [[Tewkesbury]] had to be pacified, with a branch line from [[Ashchurch]]. These were authorised by Act of 15 May 1837.{{efn|From Rake, part 1, page 146; Christiansen does not mention the date in either of the ''Regional History'' books (volume 7 and volume 13); Maggs gives 5 May in ''The Birmingham Gloucester Line''.}}<ref name = long/> for extensions to Worcester and Tewkesbury.<ref name = maggs-bham/><ref name = barnes/>\n\nConstruction had been delayed due to high prices and the difficulty of obtaining access to the land on the route, but in April 1837 it was started in earnest. However a group of shareholders cast doubt on Moorsom's ability and it was agreed that there would be a six-week delay while an eminent engineer reviewed the technical aspects of the proposed line. This was done by [[Joseph Locke]], and his report on the technical aspects, including the [[Lickey Incline]], was favourable.<ref name = long/>\n\nThe [[Cheltenham and Great Western Union Railway]] company had been short of money from the outset, chiefly due to its Parliamentary battle won with a rival to reach Cheltenham. In November 1837 it made clear it its easternmost part ([[Swindon]] to [[Cirencester]]) took total priority. Thus its agreement to lay the line between Cheltenham and Gloucester, on which the B&GR depend had banked, was put back. The B&GR were alarmed by this; if the C&GWUR were to become insolvent and their powers lapsed, the B&GR had no powers to form the line themselves.\n\nThe C&GWUR had a Bill before Parliament in the 1838 session, and it was mutually accepted that protective clauses for the B&GR could be inserted; power was given for the B&GR to build the line itself if the C&GWUR failed to do so by a date; each company would build and own one town station.<ref name = long/> The B&GR under these provisions soon built the line itself.\n\nBy August 1839 the Birmingham and Gloucester Railway had four locomotives, and 35 wagons had been delivered but an early opening that was anticipated was delayed by extremely bad weather.  The directors joined the first public passenger journey on part of the route on 1 June 1840; involving two round trips.<ref name = long/><ref name = barnes/>\n\n==Opening of the line==\nThe line was opened in stages; from Cheltenham to [[Bromsgrove]] was opened to the public without ceremony on 24 June 1840 for passenger traffic.

Three more of these were ordered. Norris's British agent persuaded the B&GR to purchase smaller \"Class B\" locomotives, and the prototype, ''England'', was trialled on the [[Grand Junction Railway]] (as the B&GR was not ready) in March 1839, and found to be non-compliant with the specification as to load haulage. Undeterred, the B&GR purchased six of the class B engines. A Class A Extra locomotive, ''Philadelphia'', was delivered at the end of May 1840; it had a sand box and water tub \"for wetting the rails to improve adhesion\".

The company noted as it would operate between the GWR at Bristol and at Standish (both crossing/ending on the [[Brunel gauge|broad gauge]]) it should make its line on the broad gauge, and this enabled it to use the GWR Temple Meads station at Bristol, and simplified the section between Standish and Gloucester, which otherwise would have needed to be built allowing [[Dual gauge|mixed (Dual) gauge]].<ref name = macdermot-1-1>E T MacDermot, ''History of the Great Western Railway: volume I: 1833 - 1863, part 1'', published by the Great Western Railway, London, 1927</ref><ref name = maggs-bristol>C G Maggs, ''The Bristol and Gloucester Railway and the Avon and Gloucestershire Railway'', The Oakwood Press, Witney, second edition 1992, {{ISBN|0-85361-435-0}}</ref>\n\nThe Bristol and Gloucester Railway opened for passenger traffic on 6 July 1844; it used a platform, intended for the C&GWUR, on the north side of the Birmingham and Gloucester Railway station there; the two lines crossed on the immediate approach to the stations.<ref name = maggs-glos>Colin G Maggs, ''Gloucestershire Railways'', Halsgrove (publisher), Wellington, 2010, {{ISBN|978 1 84114 913 4}}</ref>\n\n==Absorption by the Midland Railway==\n[[File:Camp Hill Station.jpg|thumb|Camp Hill station]]On 24 January 1845 the [[Great Western Railway]] offered to buy the two companies; this would have resulted in the broad gauge being extended to Birmingham; and was declined. [[John Ellis (businessman)|John Ellis]] of the [[Midland Railway]] encountered Edward Sturge and Joseph Gibbons while they were travelling to a second meeting with the GWR on 26 January. Ellis saw the opportunity and offered that his company would purchase the Gloucester companies, and offered to raise and spend 6% on their (own) capital of \u00a31.8 million if discussions with the GWR were inconclusive.

The disruption caused by the process of transferring goods from narrow (standard) gauge wagons to broad gauge influenced the Gauge Commission, who at the time were deliberating on recommendations to Parliament about the standardisation of the gauge in Great Britain. Of more immediate concern, the Midland Railway obtained authorisation by Act of 14 August 1848 to lay an independent narrow gauge track between Gloucester and Standish Junction (where the Cheltenham and Great Western Union Railway diverged), and to mix the gauge between Standish and Bristol. They ran their first narrow gauge train throughout on 29 May 1854.<ref name = maggs-bham/>\n\nFurther Norris locomotives were purchased, but they were crudely constructed and early replacement of fireboxes proved to be necessary. From February 1842 several were progressively converted to tank engines.<ref name = maggs-bham/>\n\n==Worcester==\nThe Birmingham and Gloucester Railway had, from the outset, implied a willingness to serve Worcester to respond to an outcry from the city over being bypassed. MPs and Peers objected to such a branch who had interests in or lobbying from its canals, the stagecoach sector and rival railways so that the early authorising Acts left such plans out.\n\nThe [[Oxford, Worcester and Wolverhampton Railway]] had been authorised on 4 August 1845; it was to be a broad gauge line, allied to the Great Western Railway. A national financial recession resulted in waylaid construction. Meanwhile, the Midland Railway was anxious to reach Worcester, and the two companies reached an agreement to lay narrow (standard) gauge track between a junction at Abbots Wood (Abbotswood) (on the B&GR main line) and Shrub Hill, a station for Worcester. The Midland Railway started operating a train service on 5 October 1850. There were five daily trains to Bristol and six to Birmingham; the Birmingham trains reversed at Abbots Wood Junction.<ref name = Boynton>John Boynton, ''The Oxford, Worcester and Wolverhampton Railway'', Mid England Books, Kidderminster, 2002, {{ISBN|0 954 0839 0 3}}</ref><ref name = christiansen13/><ref name = rake2>Herbert Rake, ''The Oxford, Worcester and Wolverhampton Railway'', (part 2) in the Railway Magazine, February 1913</ref>\n\nGough reports:\n<blockquote>The Midland worked the service on the short section between Abbot's Wood Jcn and Worcester from its commencement. When the loop to Stoke Works Jcn was completed the company began to divide its passenger trains and run one section direct and one via Worcester. The trains separated and rejoined at the two junctions. By 1855 the service on the original line consisted of two trains in each direction between Bromsgrove and Abbot's Wood, making connections with trains running via the loop. From 1 October 1855 these services were withdrawn, and all regular passenger trains ran via Worcester. Goods trains and excursion traffic continued to run via Dunhampstead [the original main line]. The Dunhampstead line was re-opened for regular traffic on 1 June 1880 to allow some through trains to by-pass Worcester, but the intermediate stations were not re-opened for passenger traffic.<ref name = gough/></blockquote>\n\n==The Direct Line at Landor Street Junction==\nThe Midland Railway had been formed by the amalgamation of the [[Birmingham and Derby Junction Railway]] with others. Both the B&DJR and the B&GR line turned westward to Curzon Street station and Landor Street, and in 1862 the Midland Railway obtained powers to construct a direct line between the two networks.\n\nThis was opened in the first half of 1864. From that time express passenger trains were run between Derby and Bristol over the direct line. Portions for Birmingham New Street station, by now opened as the main central station for the Midland Railway, were detached or attached at Saltley and Camp Hill.<ref name = christiansen7/>\n\n==Birmingham West Suburban Railway==\n{{main | Birmingham West Suburban Railway}}\nOn 3 April 1876 the Birmingham West Suburban Railway was opened, as a single line from the Midland Railway at Lifford to Granville Street canal wharf, near the centre of Birmingham. It was worked by the Midland Railway, who later acquired it. The line was intended as a suburban passenger line. A connection was made at Lifford to Kings Norton on the Birmingham and Gloucester main line, and the passenger trains from Granville Street ran to that place.\n\nIn 1881 an Act authorised an extension north-eastwards, so as to connect to New Street station in Birmingham. This was opened in 1885 and from that time express passenger trains between Bristol and Birmingham used the West Suburban line. This had the added advantage of entering New Street station from the west, enabling forward running on to the Midland Railway's Derby line without reversal.<ref name = christiansen7/>\n\n==Lifford Curve==\nIn 1892 a curve was installed at Lifford forming the third side of a triangle there, and enabling circular suburban passenger train operation.<ref name = christiansen7/>\n\n==Lickey bank engines==\n[[File:Lickey Bank geograph-2611010-by-Ben-Brooksbank.jpg|thumb|A train ascending the Lickey Incline, assisted in rear by a banking engine]]Banking on the Lickey incline remained an operational inconvenience throughout the years of steam traction. In 1920 a [[MR 0-10-0 Lickey Banker|four cylinder 0-10-0 locomotive]] was built specially of the purpose; no 2290, it was known informally as Big Bertha, in association with the German [[Big Bertha (howitzer)|heavy howitzer]] used during [[World War I]].

The backbone, Lickey route, carried the heaviest traffic by a moderate margin.  The second line overlapped on the use of an east-of-Gloucester stretch of track [[Gloucester to Newport Line|for the onward link to South Wales]]; the third was principally Welsh-related and would be circuitous and involve the Great Western's Severn Tunnel for the South West of England.  Concentration and rationalisation were sought at the time.  Diesel traction had rendered the Lickey incline a negligible problem so it was declared the general freight route from Spring 1965; heavy through freight shifted away from the Honeybourne route.<ref name = christiansen7/>\n\n==The present day==\n[[File:Bredon railway station 1892216 93cd0d95.jpg|thumb|right|View southward of [[Bredon railway station]] towards Cheltenham in 1960.]]\nThe line is an important part of the British railway network, forming a section of the Bristol to Birmingham main line.\n\nFrequent long-distance passenger services operate by [[CrossCountry]], part of [[Arriva UK Trains]]. The line is also an important freight route. [[London Midland]] operate the local passenger service from [[Hereford]] to [[Birmingham New Street]], which uses the line only closer to the latter (Stoke Works Junction to Kings Norton).\n\nA brief corollary known as former Birmingham West Suburban Railway is used by the majority of Birmingham New Street passenger trains; a few through trains use the original Camp Hill route for convenience in approaching or leaving that hub station at the east end rather than the west.\n\nMost of the freight traffic uses the Camp Hill route, which gives quick connectivity to the national network at Saltley.\n\nThe Tewkesbury branch closed in 1961 to passengers and completely in 1964.\n\n==Accidents and incidents==\nOn 10 November 1840, the boiler of locomotive ''Surprise'' exploded at [[Bromsgrove]].

It linked with the [[Bristol and Gloucester Railway]] in Gloucester, but at first that company's line was [[Brunel gauge|broad gauge]], and Gloucester was a point of the necessary but inconvenient transhipment of goods and passengers onto {{Track gauge|uksg}} gauge that became the national standard.  Nearly all of the original main line remains active as a \"trunk\" route, also known as an arterial route or line.\n\nIts main line incorporated the [[Lickey Incline]] {{convert|2|mi|km}} of track climbing a 1-in-37 (2.7%) gradient, northbound (and descending in the other). The climb was a challenge or impediment for many of the heaviest loads and weaker engines during the era of steam traction.\n\nHaving attracted its own patronage, capital and accomplished fully functional transformation and employment of land, buildings, labour force and rolling stock in 1846, it was acquired by the Midland Railway.\n\n==First proposals==\n[[File:Brum&glos.png|thumb|The Birmingham and Gloucester Railway system in 1845]]The idea for a railway line between [[Bristol]] and [[Birmingham]] was put forward during the construction of the [[Stockton and Darlington Railway]]. 78,000 tons of goods were conveyed from Birmingham to Bristol annually, a journey that took nearly a week, and the cost of the journey was high. At a meeting in Bristol on 13 December 1824 subscriptions were taken for a proposed ''Bristol, Northern and Western Railway''.<ref name = long>P J Long and W V Awdry, ''The Birmingham and Gloucester Railway'', Alan Sutton Publishing, Gloucester, 1987, {{ISBN|0 86299 329 6}}</ref> Investors, among which wealthy venture capitalists, were enthusiasts of the scheme and before the fund promoters' prospectus meeting closed, all the 16,000 shares allocated to Bristol were taken up. A further 9,000 shares were created, the subscription fee and paying-up of which was allocated to other locations, and the total amounted to \u00a3{{frac|1|1|4}} million ({{Inflation|GBP|1250000|1824|r=-3|fmt=eq|cursign=\u00a3}}), in an era when cheap and plentiful labourers' and professional work would have enabled the construction of thousands of houses or road modifications (e.g. regular bridges) for such a sum. The company surveyed the route in 1825 but there was a [[Panic of 1826|financial crisis in 1826]] in which investors asked for the project to be suspended, which the company did.<ref name = maggs-bham>Colin Maggs, ''The Birmingham Gloucester Line'', Line One Publishing Limited, Cheltenham, 1986, {{ISBN|0-907036-10-4}}</ref><ref name = rake1>Herbert Rake, ''The South-western Extension of the Midland Railway: the Birmingham and Gloucester Railway: part 1'', in the Railway Magazine, February 1904</ref><ref name = barnes>E G Barnes, ''The Rise of the Midland Railway, 1844-1874'', George Allen & Unwin Ltd, London, Chapter 5</ref>\n\nIn 1832 the company advanced a new scheme; [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel]] was asked to survey a cheap route between Birmingham and [[Gloucester]]. He avoided the barrier of the [[Lickey Hills]] and his maximum gradient would have been 1 in 300. This scheme too failed to make progress due to lack of funds.<ref name = long/><ref name = christiansen7>Rex Christiansen, ''A Regional History of the Railways of Great Britain: volume 7: the West Midlands'', David & Charles, Newton Abbot, 1973, {{ISBN|0 7153 6093 0}}</ref>\n\n==Birmingham and Gloucester Railway proposed==\nThe idea was revived when in 1834 [[William Moorsom|Captain W S Moorsom]] was engaged to survey a route; once again economy was considered to be essential, and his route avoided large towns thus lowered cost of the land. By-passed townspeople expressed disappointment and [[Cheltenham]] was particularly vocal. Moorsom modified his intended route to provide it a station, but that was not considered convenient for the centre of the town, and a branch line was proposed. When the B&GR promoters refused to contemplate the expense of that, [[Pearson Thompson]], a prominent Cheltenham resident and a member of the Gloucester Committee of the B&GR, offered to build it himself at his own expense.<ref name = long/>\n\nAround Birmingham local politics and geographic factors proved easier; a connection to the [[London and Birmingham Railway]] close to the nascent city was agreed, moreover, L&BR agreed to shared use of their [[Birmingham Curzon Street railway station (1838-1966)|Curzon Street station]] on payment of a toll. As well as giving a direct connection to London, and over the [[Grand Junction Railway]] to the north west of England, this avoided the expense of constructing a new terminus in the city.<ref name = long/>\n\nMoorsom estimated the cost of construction to be \u00a3920,000.<ref name = long/> Moorsom's route did climb the [[Lickey Ridge]] directly, involving a long climb.

They came to an arrangement by which they would collaborate in the construction. The line between Gloucester and Cheltenham was to be divided, the Cheltenham end being built by the Birmingham company and the Gloucester end by the C&GWUR. Each would build one of the stations and both would have freedom to run over the whole line and use both the stations.

Stone for house building was in demand at the time. Acquisition of the tramroad was sought by the B&GR and the C&GWUR; its alignment was unsuitable for a main line railway but its dock trade and access were very attractive. The collaborative approach to building the new main line extended to the issue of acquiring the tramroad, and it was agreed to do so jointly, for the sum of \u00a335,000.<ref name = bick>David Bick, ''The Gloucester & Cheltenham Tramroad and the Leckhampton Quarry Lines'', Oakwood Press, Usk, second edition 1987, {{ISBN|0 85361 336 2}}</ref><ref name = long/>\n\n==Authorisation==\n[[File:Lickey bank.png|thumb|The Lickey Incline about 1845]]\nAt this stage the line was conceived as a toll railway (on which independent carriers would run trains, paying the B&GR a toll for that right).

To assuage fear of other railway company competition, the B&GR agreed to provide it a branch line, from Abbotswood in the county. Similarly [[Tewkesbury]] had to be pacified, with a branch line from [[Ashchurch]]. These were authorised by Act of 15 May 1837.<ref group = note>From Rake, part 1, page 146; Christiansen does not mention the date in either of the ''Regional History'' books (volume 7 and volume 13); Maggs gives 5 May in ''The Birmingham Gloucester Line''.</ref><ref name = long/> for extensions to Worcester and Tewkesbury.<ref name = maggs-bham/><ref name = barnes/>\n\nConstruction had been delayed due to high prices and the difficulty of obtaining access to the land on the route, but in April 1837 it was started in earnest. However a group of shareholders cast doubt on Moorsom's ability and it was agreed that there would be a six-week delay while an eminent engineer reviewed the technical aspects of the proposed line. This was done by [[Joseph Locke]], and his report on the technical aspects, including the [[Lickey Incline]], was favourable.<ref name = long/>\n\nThe [[Cheltenham and Great Western Union Railway]] company had been short of money from the outset, chiefly due to its Parliamentary battle won with a rival to reach Cheltenham. In November 1837 it made clear it its easternmost part ([[Swindon]] to [[Cirencester]]) took total priority. Thus its agreement to lay the line between Cheltenham and Gloucester, on which the B&GR depend had banked, was put back. The B&GR were alarmed by this; if the C&GWUR were to become insolvent and their powers lapsed, the B&GR had no powers to form the line themselves.\n\nThe C&GWUR had a Bill before Parliament in the 1838 session, and it was mutually accepted that protective clauses for the B&GR could be inserted; power was given for the B&GR to build the line itself if the C&GWUR failed to do so by a date; each company would build and own one town station.<ref name = long/> The B&GR under these provisions soon built the line itself.\n\nBy August 1839 the Birmingham and Gloucester Railway had four locomotives, and 35 wagons had been delivered but an early opening that was anticipated was delayed by extremely bad weather.

The disruption caused by the process of transferring goods from narrow (standard) gauge wagons to broad gauge influenced the Gauge Commission, who at the time were deliberating on recommendations to Parliament about the standardisation of the gauge in Great Britain. Of more immediate concern, the Midland Railway obtained authorisation by Act of 14 August 1848 to lay an independent narrow gauge track between Gloucester and Standish Junction (where the Cheltenham and Great Western Union Railway diverged), and to mix the gauge between Standish and Bristol. They ran their first narrow gauge train throughout on 29 May 1854.<ref name = maggs-bham/>\n\nFurther Norris locomotives were purchased, but they were crudely constructed and early replacement of fireboxes proved to be necessary.

MPs and Peers objected to such a branch who had interests in or lobbying from its canals, the stagecoach sector and rival railways so that the early authorising Acts left such plans out.\n\nThe [[Oxford, Worcester and Wolverhampton Railway]] had been authorised on 4 August 1845; it was to be a broad gauge line, allied to the Great Western Railway. A national financial recession resulted in waylaid construction. Meanwhile, the Midland Railway was anxious to reach Worcester, and the two companies reached an agreement to lay narrow (standard) gauge track between a junction at Abbots Wood (Abbotswood) (on the B&GR main line) and Shrub Hill, a station for Worcester. The Midland Railway started operating a train service on 5 October 1850. There were five daily trains to Bristol and six to Birmingham; the Birmingham trains reversed at Abbots Wood Junction.<ref name = Boynton>John Boynton, ''The Oxford, Worcester and Wolverhampton Railway'', Mid England Books, Kidderminster, 2002, {{ISBN|0 954 0839 0 3}}</ref><ref name = christiansen13/><ref name = rake2>Herbert Rake, ''The Oxford, Worcester and Wolverhampton Railway'', (part 2) in the Railway Magazine, February 1913</ref>\n\nGough reports:\n<blockquote>The Midland worked the service on the short section between Abbot's Wood Jcn and Worcester from its commencement. When the loop to Stoke Works Jcn was completed the company began to divide its passenger trains and run one section direct and one via Worcester. The trains separated and rejoined at the two junctions. By 1855 the service on the original line consisted of two trains in each direction between Bromsgrove and Abbot's Wood, making connections with trains running via the loop. From 1 October 1855 these services were withdrawn, and all regular passenger trains ran via Worcester. Goods trains and excursion traffic continued to run via Dunhampstead [the original main line]. The Dunhampstead line was re-opened for regular traffic on 1 June 1880 to allow some through trains to by-pass Worcester, but the intermediate stations were not re-opened for passenger traffic.<ref name = gough/></blockquote>\n\n==The Direct Line at Landor Street Junction==\nThe Midland Railway had been formed by the amalgamation of the [[Birmingham and Derby Junction Railway]] with others. Both the B&DJR and the B&GR line turned westward to Curzon Street station and Landor Street, and in 1862 the Midland Railway obtained powers to construct a direct line between the two networks.\n\nThis was opened in the first half of 1864.

It was worked by the Midland Railway, who later acquired it. The line was intended as a suburban passenger line. A connection was made at Lifford to Kings Norton on the Birmingham and Gloucester main line, and the passenger trains from Granville Street ran to that place.\n\nIn 1881 an Act authorised an extension north-eastwards, so as to connect to New Street station in Birmingham. This was opened in 1885 and from that time express passenger trains between Bristol and Birmingham used the West Suburban line.

The backbone, Lickey route, carried the heaviest traffic by a moderate margin.  The second line overlapped on the use of an east-of-Gloucester stretch of track [[Gloucester to Newport Line|for the onward link to South Wales]]; the third was principally Welsh-related and would be circuitous and involve the Great Western's Severn Tunnel for the South West of England.  Concentration and rationalisation were sought at the time.

[[London Midland]] operate the local passenger service from [[Hereford]] to [[Birmingham New Street]], which uses the line only closer to the latter (Stoke Works Junction to Kings Norton).\n\nA brief corollary known as former Birmingham West Suburban Railway is used by the majority of Birmingham New Street passenger trains; a few through trains use the original Camp Hill route for convenience in approaching or leaving that hub station at the east end rather than the west.\n\nMost of the freight traffic uses the Camp Hill route, which gives quick connectivity to the national network at Saltley.\n\nThe Tewkesbury branch closed in 1961 to passengers and completely in 1964.\n\n==Accidents and incidents==\nOn 10 November 1840, the boiler of locomotive ''Surprise'' exploded at [[Bromsgrove]].

With only the early [[immunosuppressants]] and no long-term [[dialysis]], the female recipient survived nine months, long enough to return to work.\n\nReemtsma was brought up on a [[Navajo Nation|Navajo]] reservation in [[Arizona]], eventually moving to [[Utah]] and then graduating from [[Idaho State College]] in [[Pocatello]] in 1945. In the 1960s he was professor of surgery at [[Tulane University|Tulane University, Louisiana]] and he later became chairman of the Department of Surgery at the [[University of Utah]].\n\nReemtsma also developed the [[intra-aortic balloon pump]] to bridge the time to [[heart transplant]], and performed early research on [[pancreas|pancreatic]] [[islet cell transplantation]] for [[diabetes mellitus]]. In 1971, he was appointed chairman of the Department of Surgery at [[NewYork\u2013Presbyterian Hospital]] and [[Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons|Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons]], where he was involved in developing a multidisciplinary approach to transplant services, as well as advocating surgical repair and reconstruction as an alternative to radical excision.\n\n== Early life ==\nReemtsma was born in [[Madera, California]], on 5 December 1925, to the Presbyterian minister and missionary Henry and Pauline Reemtsma.

With only the early [[immunosuppressants]] and no long-term [[dialysis]], the female recipient survived nine months, long enough to return to work.\n\nReemtsma was brought up on a [[Navajo Nation|Navajo]] reservation in [[Arizona]], eventually moving to [[Utah]] and then graduating from [[Idaho State College]] in [[Pocatello]] in 1945. In the 1960s he was professor of surgery at [[Tulane University|Tulane University, Louisiana]] and he later became chairman of the Department of Surgery at the [[University of Utah]].\n\nReemtsma also developed the [[intra-aortic balloon pump]] to bridge the time to [[heart transplant]], and performed early research on [[pancreas|pancreatic]] [[islet cell transplantation]] for [[diabetes mellitus]]. In 1971, he was appointed chairman of the Department of Surgery at [[NewYork\u2013Presbyterian Hospital]] and [[Vagelos College of Physicians and Surgeons|Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons]], where he was involved in developing a multidisciplinary approach to transplant services, as well as advocating surgical repair and reconstruction as an alternative to radical excision.\n\n== Early life ==\nReemtsma was born in [[Madera, California]], on 5 December 1925, to the Presbyterian minister and missionary Henry and Pauline Reemtsma. He had one older sister, Carol, and from 1938 was raised on a Navajo reservation in Arizona when he attended a one-room school house which taught only to eighth grade.<ref name=\":DeAnda2015\">{{Cite journal|last=DeAnda|first=Abe|last2=Balsam|first2=Leora B.|date=October 2015|title=Historical perspectives of The American Association for Thoracic Surgery: Keith Reemtsma (1925&ndash;2000)|url=https://www.jtcvs.org/article/S0022-5223(14)00968-4/pdf|journal=The Journal of Thoracic and Cardiovascular Surgery|volume=150|issue=4|pages=762\u2013764|via=|doi=10.1016/j.jtcvs.2014.07.009|pmid=25135241|doi-access=free}}</ref>\n\nAs he progressed in his education, he moved from schools in [[Oklahoma]] to a Presbyterian boarding school in [[Mount Pleasant, Utah]], where he met his first wife to be, Ann Pierce.<ref name=\":DeAnda2015\"/> He attended [[Idaho State College]] as part of the [[United States Navy]] V-12 programme, where the federal government funded studies to participating colleges.

K. Rowling|J.K. Rowling]] and the sixth and penultimate novel in the ''[[Harry Potter]]'' series. Set during [[Harry Potter (character)|Harry Potter]]'s sixth year at [[Hogwarts]], the novel explores the past of Harry's nemesis, [[Lord Voldemort]], and Harry's preparations for the final battle against Voldemort alongside his headmaster and mentor [[Albus Dumbledore]].\n\nThe book was published in the United Kingdom by [[Bloomsbury Publishing|Bloomsbury]] and in the United States by [[Scholastic Corporation|Scholastic]] on 16 July 2005, as well as in several other countries. It sold nine million copies in the first 24&nbsp;hours after its release, a record that was eventually broken by its sequel, ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows]]''. There were many controversies before and after it was published, including the right to read copies delivered before the release date in Canada. Reception to the novel was generally positive, and it won several awards and honours, including the 2006 [[British Book of the Year]] award.\n\nReviewers noted that the book took on a darker tone than its predecessors, though it did contain some humour. Some considered the main themes to be love, death, trust, and redemption. The considerable character development of Harry and many other teenage characters also drew attention.\n\nThe [[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (film)|film adaptation]] of ''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'' was released 15 July 2009 by [[Warner Bros]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!--Please do not add extensive or in-universe content. It should be understandable to someone who knows absolutely nothing about Harry Potter-->\n\n[[Severus Snape]], a member of the [[Order of the Phoenix (organisation)|Order of the Phoenix]], meets with [[List of supporting Harry Potter characters#Narcissa Malfoy|Narcissa Malfoy]], [[Draco Malfoy|Draco]]'s mother, and her sister [[Death Eater#Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix Lestrange]], [[Lord Voldemort]]'s faithful supporter. Narcissa expresses her concern that her son might not survive a dangerous mission given him by [[Lord Voldemort]]. Bellatrix feels Snape will be of no help until he surprises her by making an [[Magic in Harry Potter#Unbreakable Vow|Unbreakable Vow]] with Narcissa, swearing on his life that he will protect and assist Draco in his mission.\n\n[[Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]] picks Harry up from his aunt and uncle's house, intending to escort him to [[Places in Harry Potter|the Burrow]], the home of Harry's best friend [[Ron Weasley|Ron]] and his large family. On the way, they make a detour to the temporary home of [[Hogwarts staff#Horace Slughorn|Horace Slughorn]], former [[Magic in Harry Potter#Potions|Potions]] teacher at [[Hogwarts]], and Harry unwittingly helps persuade Slughorn to return to teach. Harry and Dumbledore then proceed to the Burrow, where Hermione has already arrived.\n\nThe next morning, Harry, Ron, and Hermione get their [[Hogwarts#Subjects_and_teachers|O.W.L.]] exam results, along with lists of school supplies. Harry's letter reveals that he has been made captain of the Gryffindor [[Quidditch]] team. Later, Harry, [[Ron Weasley|Ron]], and [[Hermione Granger|Hermione]] follow Draco to [[Magic in Harry Potter#Dark Arts|Dark Arts]] artifacts supplier [[Places in Harry Potter#Borgin & Burkes|Borgin and Burke's]] in [[Places in Harry Potter#Knockturn Alley|Knockturn Alley]]. Harry is suspicious of Draco, who he believes has become a [[Death Eater]] following the arrest of his father [[Lucius Malfoy|Lucius]].\n\nOn the [[Hogwarts Express]], Harry discusses his suspicions of Draco's allegiance to Lord Voldemort, but Ron and Hermione are doubtful because of Harry's lack of evidence. Harry dons his [[Invisibility cloak (Harry Potter)|invisibility cloak]] and hides in the same carriage in which Malfoy is seated. He overhears Draco bragging to his friends about the mission Lord Voldemort has given him. However, Malfoy suspects someone else is in the carriage and discovers Harry was listening to his conversation. Malfoy petrifies Harry and breaks his nose out of rage. Harry cannot get out of the carriage, and he is worried the Hogwarts Express will depart before he can move again. To his relief, [[Nymphadora Tonks]]<!-- Please do not change this to Luna Lovegood. In the book (not the film), it is Tonks who finds Harry. --> finds Harry and escorts him to the castle during the opening feast.\n\nThe students return to school, where [[Dumbledore]] announces Snape will be teaching [[Magic in Harry Potter#Defence Against the Dark Arts|Defence Against the Dark Arts]]. Dumbledore also announces Horace Slughorn will resume his previous post as Potions master. Harry now excels in Potions, thanks to having received a used Potions textbook that once belonged to someone named \"The Half-Blood Prince,\" a mysterious former student who wrote numerous tips and spells in the book that sometimes contradict the written text. Harry uses this information to achieve superb results. During a class contest, The Half-Blood Prince's tips help Harry win a bottle of Felix Felicis, more commonly known as \"Liquid Luck.\" Though Harry's success pleases Slughorn, his newfound brilliance in potions angers Hermione, who feels he is not truly earning his grades and also does not trust the Half-Blood Prince.\n\nBelieving Harry needs to learn Voldemort's past to gain an advantage in a foretold battle, Dumbledore schedules regular meetings with Harry in his office. Dumbledore and Harry use Dumbledore's [[Magical objects in Harry Potter#Pensieve|Pensieve]] to look at the memories of those who have had direct contact with Voldemort. Harry learns about [[Lord Voldemort#Family|Voldemort's family]] and his foe's evolution into a murderer obsessed not only with power but with gaining eternal life. Dumbledore shows Harry a memory involving Slughorn conversing with a young Tom Riddle at Hogwarts. The memory has clearly been tampered with. Dumbledore sets Harry the task of convincing Slughorn to give him the true memory so Dumbledore can confirm his suspicions about Voldemort's rise to power and near-invincibility. \n\nMeanwhile, security tightens around the wizarding world now that everyone believes Voldemort has returned. Some people get murdered by Death Eaters. Harry finds several bits of proof that make him even more suspicious of Draco.\n\nA few months later, after receiving an invitation to the funeral for [[Aragog]] the [[Acromantula]], Harry uses an hour's dose of Felix Felicis and succeeds in retrieving Slughorn's unedited memory while at the funeral. Harry presents the memory to Dumbledore, and they watch it together. In it, Slughorn tells Riddle about the process of splitting one's soul and hiding it in several objects called [[Horcruxes]]. Only by committing a murder can a wizard turn an object into a Horcrux. Dumbledore tells Harry he suspects Voldemort has created six [[Horcruxes]], making himself virtually immortal by placing a piece of his soul in each one and keeping the seventh within his body. Dumbledore explains that, in order to destroy Voldemort, all the Horcruxes must first be destroyed. Two Horcruxes, Riddle's diary from [[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets]] and a ring belonging to Voldemort's grandfather [[Marvolo Gaunt]], have already been destroyed, but four others remain.\n\nAs Harry learns more about his great enemy, the love lives of the main characters become more active. Ron and Hermione grow closer together, but after learning from his sister [[Ginny Weasley|Ginny]] that Hermione had previously kissed [[Viktor Krum]], Ron is angered and shuns her. Harry attempts to repair things between the two but fails, resulting in Ron going out with [[Lavender Brown]] and making Hermione jealous. After Ron is nearly killed in an attempt on Dumbledore's life, he and Hermione reconcile. Ron and Lavender break up when Lavender sees the two of them walking out of the boys' dormitory together while Harry was under his father's [[Invisibility cloak (Harry Potter)|Invisibility Cloak]]. Harry develops deep feelings for Ginny but is reluctant to pursue her for most of the year because of his friendship with Ron. Following a wild Gryffindor [[Quidditch]] victory, Harry and Ginny finally strike up a relationship of which Ron reluctantly approves.\n\nNear the end of the year, Harry and Dumbledore journey to a remote cave far from Hogwarts to retrieve a suspected Horcrux, [[Magical objects in Harry Potter#Salazar Slytherin's Locket|Slytherin's locket]]. Dumbledore finds a secret passageway to a large, pitch-black underground lake, which Harry and Dumbledore cross in a small boat to an island at the centre. The locket is at the bottom of a basin on the island and can only be reached if someone drinks the potion concealing it. Harry aids Dumbledore, who drinks the potion, which causes him to experience vivid hallucinations and torturous pain. Though Dumbledore is severely weakened after finishing the potion, the two manage to fight off Voldemort's [[Inferi (Harry Potter)|Inferi]] that have been hiding in the lake. They take the locket and return to Hogwarts to find the [[Magic in Harry Potter#Dark Mark|Dark Mark]] hovering over the school's Astronomy Tower. Harry and Dumbledore ascend to the tower, where they are ambushed by Draco Malfoy, who is accompanied by Death Eaters he helped get inside Hogwarts. Dumbledore freezes Harry under his Invisibility Cloak with a freezing spell to keep him hidden. At the same time, Draco disarms Dumbledore and then threatens to kill him, which turns out to have been Draco's mission from Voldemort all along. Draco is unable to go through with it, and when Snape arrives, he kills Dumbledore instead. Harry ignores the battle raging in Hogwarts to pursue Dumbledore's killer. Snape successfully fights Harry off, and he reveals that he is the Half-Blood Prince before he, Draco, and the rest of the Death Eaters escape.\n\nAfter Dumbledore's funeral, Harry decides to break up with Ginny, saying she would be in danger should their relationship continue. Later, Harry finds out the locket is not the real Horcrux. The fake Horcrux contains a note from someone named \"[[Death Eater#Regulus Black|R.A.B.]]\". Harry is devastated by Dumbledore's death, and he tells his friends he will not return to Hogwarts. Instead, he says he will spend the next year searching out Voldemort's Horcruxes. Ron and Hermione insist on joining him in destroying Lord Voldemort for good.\n\n==Development==\n===Franchise===\n''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'' is the sixth book in the [[Harry Potter|Harry Potter series]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/cbbcnews/hi/newsid_6280000/newsid_6282500/6282542.stm|title=Book 6 \u2013 The Half-Blood Prince|publisher=CBBC Newsround|accessdate=23 March 2011|date=10 July 2007|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227001235/http://news.bbc.co.uk/cbbcnews/hi/newsid_6280000/newsid_6282500/6282542.stm|archivedate=27 February 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The first book in the series, ''[[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone]]'', was first published by Bloomsbury in 1997, with an initial print-run of 500 copies in hardback, 300 of which were distributed to libraries.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tomfolio.com/PublisherInfo/HarryPotter.asp |title=The Phenomenon of Harry Potter |last=Elisco |first=Lester |date=2000\u20132009 |publisher=TomFolio.com |accessdate=22 January 2009 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090412015849/http://www.tomfolio.com/PublisherInfo/HarryPotter.asp |archivedate=12 April 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> By the end of 1997, the UK edition won a [[National Book Award]] and a gold medal in the 9-&nbsp;to&nbsp;11-year-olds category of the [[Nestl\u00e9 Smarties Book Prize]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Knapp |first=N.F. |year=2003 |title=In Defense of Harry Potter: An Apologia |journal=School Libraries Worldwide |publisher=International Association of School Librarianship |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=78\u201391 |url=http://www.iasl-online.org/files/jan03-knapp.pdf |accessdate=14 May 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110309051050/http://www.iasl-online.org/files/jan03-knapp.pdf |archivedate=9 March 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The second book, ''[[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets]]'', was originally published in the UK on 2 July 1998 and in the US on 2 June 1999.<ref name=\"Harry Potter UK Release Dates\">{{cite news |url=https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/article/235354 |title=A Potter timeline for muggles |date=14 July 2007 |work=Toronto Star |accessdate=27 September 2008 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081220001353/http://www.thestar.com/entertainment/article/235354 |archivedate=20 December 2008 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref name=\"Harry Potter US&nbsp;\u2014 Scholastic\">{{cite web|url=http://www.scholastic.com/harrypotter/books/author/index.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070604101828/http://www.scholastic.com/harrypotter/books/author/index.htm|archivedate=4 June 2007 |title=Harry Potter: Meet J.K.

K. Rowling|J.K. Rowling]] and the sixth and penultimate novel in the ''[[Harry Potter]]'' series. Set during [[Harry Potter (character)|Harry Potter]]'s sixth year at [[Hogwarts]], the novel explores the past of Harry's nemesis, [[Lord Voldemort]], and Harry's preparations for the final battle against Voldemort alongside his headmaster and mentor [[Albus Dumbledore]].\n\nThe book was published in the United Kingdom by [[Bloomsbury Publishing|Bloomsbury]] and in the United States by [[Scholastic Corporation|Scholastic]] on 16 July 2005, as well as in several other countries. It sold nine million copies in the first 24&nbsp;hours after its release, a record that was eventually broken by its sequel, ''[[Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows]]''. There were many controversies before and after it was published, including the right to read copies delivered before the release date in Canada. Reception to the novel was generally positive, and it won several awards and honours, including the 2006 [[British Book of the Year]] award.\n\nReviewers noted that the book took on a darker tone than its predecessors, though it did contain some humour. Some considered the main themes to be love, death, trust, and redemption. The considerable character development of Harry and many other teenage characters also drew attention.\n\nThe [[Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince (film)|film adaptation]] of ''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'' was released 15 July 2009 by [[Warner Bros]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!--Please do not add extensive or in-universe content. It should be understandable to someone who knows absolutely nothing about Harry Potter-->\n\n[[Severus Snape]], a member of the [[Order of the Phoenix (organisation)|Order of the Phoenix]], meets with [[List of supporting Harry Potter characters#Narcissa Malfoy|Narcissa Malfoy]], [[Draco Malfoy|Draco]]'s mother, and her sister [[Death Eater#Bellatrix Lestrange|Bellatrix Lestrange]], [[Lord Voldemort]]'s faithful supporter. Narcissa expresses her concern that her son might not survive a dangerous mission given him by [[Lord Voldemort]]. Bellatrix feels Snape will be of no help until he surprises her by making an [[Magic in Harry Potter#Unbreakable Vow|Unbreakable Vow]] with Narcissa, swearing on his life that he will protect and assist Draco in his mission.\n\n[[Albus Dumbledore|Dumbledore]] picks Harry up from his aunt and uncle's house, intending to escort him to [[Places in Harry Potter|the Burrow]], the home of Harry's best friend [[Ron Weasley|Ron]] and his large family. On the way, they make a detour to the temporary home of [[Hogwarts staff#Horace Slughorn|Horace Slughorn]], former [[Magic in Harry Potter#Potions|Potions]] teacher at [[Hogwarts]], and Harry unwittingly helps persuade Slughorn to return to teach. Harry and Dumbledore then proceed to the Burrow, where Hermione has already arrived.\n\nThe next morning, Harry, Ron, and Hermione get their [[Hogwarts#Subjects_and_teachers|O.W.L.]] exam results, along with lists of school supplies. Harry's letter reveals that he has been made captain of the Gryffindor [[Quidditch]] team. Later, Harry, [[Ron Weasley|Ron]], and [[Hermione Granger|Hermione]] follow Draco to [[Magic in Harry Potter#Dark Arts|Dark Arts]] artifacts supplier [[Places in Harry Potter#Borgin & Burkes|Borgin and Burke's]] in [[Places in Harry Potter#Knockturn Alley|Knockturn Alley]]. Harry is suspicious of Draco, who he believes has become a [[Death Eater]] following the arrest of his father [[Lucius Malfoy|Lucius]].\n\nOn the [[Hogwarts Express]], Harry discusses his suspicions of Draco's allegiance to Lord Voldemort, but Ron and Hermione are doubtful because of Harry's lack of evidence. Harry dons his [[Invisibility cloak (Harry Potter)|invisibility cloak]] and hides in the same carriage in which Malfoy is seated. He overhears Draco bragging to his friends about the mission Lord Voldemort has given him. However, Malfoy suspects someone else is in the carriage and discovers Harry was listening to his conversation. Malfoy petrifies Harry and breaks his nose out of rage. Harry cannot get out of the carriage, and he is worried the Hogwarts Express will depart before he can move again. To his relief, [[Nymphadora Tonks]]<!-- Please do not change this to Luna Lovegood. In the book (not the film), it is Tonks who finds Harry. --> finds Harry and escorts him to the castle during the opening feast.\n\nThe students return to school, where [[Dumbledore]] announces Snape will be teaching [[Magic in Harry Potter#Defence Against the Dark Arts|Defence Against the Dark Arts]]. Dumbledore also announces Horace Slughorn will resume his previous post as Potions master. Harry now excels in Potions, thanks to having received a used Potions textbook that once belonged to someone named \"The Half-Blood Prince,\" a mysterious former student who wrote numerous tips and spells in the book that sometimes contradict the written text. Harry uses this information to achieve superb results. During a class contest, The Half-Blood Prince's tips help Harry win a bottle of Felix Felicis, more commonly known as \"Liquid Luck.\" Though Harry's success pleases Slughorn, his newfound brilliance in potions angers Hermione, who feels he is not truly earning his grades and also does not trust the Half-Blood Prince.\n\nBelieving Harry needs to learn Voldemort's past to gain an advantage in a foretold battle, Dumbledore schedules regular meetings with Harry in his office. Dumbledore and Harry use Dumbledore's [[Magical objects in Harry Potter#Pensieve|Pensieve]] to look at the memories of those who have had direct contact with Voldemort. Harry learns about [[Lord Voldemort#Family|Voldemort's family]] and his foe's evolution into a murderer obsessed not only with power but with gaining eternal life. Dumbledore shows Harry a memory involving Slughorn conversing with a young Tom Riddle at Hogwarts. The memory has clearly been tampered with. Dumbledore sets Harry the task of convincing Slughorn to give him the true memory so Dumbledore can confirm his suspicions about Voldemort's rise to power and near-invincibility. \n\nMeanwhile, security tightens around the wizarding world now that everyone believes Voldemort has returned. Some people get murdered by Death Eaters. Harry finds several bits of proof that make him even more suspicious of Draco.\n\nA few months later, after receiving an invitation to the funeral for [[Aragog]] the [[Acromantula]], Harry uses an hour's dose of Felix Felicis and succeeds in retrieving Slughorn's unedited memory while at the funeral. Harry presents the memory to Dumbledore, and they watch it together. In it, Slughorn tells Riddle about the process of splitting one's soul and hiding it in several objects called [[Horcruxes]]. Only by committing a murder can a wizard turn an object into a Horcrux. Dumbledore tells Harry he suspects Voldemort has created six [[Horcruxes]], making himself virtually immortal by placing a piece of his soul in each one and keeping the seventh within his body. Dumbledore explains that, in order to destroy Voldemort, all the Horcruxes must first be destroyed. Two Horcruxes, Riddle's diary from [[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets]] and a ring belonging to Voldemort's grandfather [[Marvolo Gaunt]], have already been destroyed, but four others remain.\n\nAs Harry learns more about his great enemy, the love lives of the main characters become more active. Ron and Hermione grow closer together, but after learning from his sister [[Ginny Weasley|Ginny]] that Hermione had previously kissed [[Viktor Krum]], Ron is angered and shuns her. Harry attempts to repair things between the two but fails, resulting in Ron going out with [[Lavender Brown]] and making Hermione jealous. After Ron is nearly killed in an attempt on Dumbledore's life, he and Hermione reconcile. Ron and Lavender break up when Lavender sees the two of them walking out of the boys' dormitory together while Harry was under his father's [[Invisibility cloak (Harry Potter)|Invisibility Cloak]]. Harry develops deep feelings for Ginny but is reluctant to pursue her for most of the year because of his friendship with Ron. Following a wild Gryffindor [[Quidditch]] victory, Harry and Ginny finally strike up a relationship of which Ron reluctantly approves.\n\nNear the end of the year, Harry and Dumbledore journey to a remote cave far from Hogwarts to retrieve a suspected Horcrux, [[Magical objects in Harry Potter#Salazar Slytherin's Locket|Slytherin's locket]]. Dumbledore finds a secret passageway to a large, pitch-black underground lake, which Harry and Dumbledore cross in a small boat to an island at the centre. The locket is at the bottom of a basin on the island and can only be reached if someone drinks the potion concealing it. Harry aids Dumbledore, who drinks the potion, which causes him to experience vivid hallucinations and torturous pain. Though Dumbledore is severely weakened after finishing the potion, the two manage to fight off Voldemort's [[Inferi (Harry Potter)|Inferi]] that have been hiding in the lake. They take the locket and return to Hogwarts to find the [[Magic in Harry Potter#Dark Mark|Dark Mark]] hovering over the school's Astronomy Tower. Harry and Dumbledore ascend to the tower, where they are ambushed by Draco Malfoy, who is accompanied by Death Eaters he helped get inside Hogwarts. Dumbledore freezes Harry under his Invisibility Cloak with a freezing spell to keep him hidden. At the same time, Draco disarms Dumbledore and then threatens to kill him, which turns out to have been Draco's mission from Voldemort all along. Draco is unable to go through with it, and when Snape arrives, he kills Dumbledore instead. Harry ignores the battle raging in Hogwarts to pursue Dumbledore's killer. Snape successfully fights Harry off, and he reveals that he is the Half-Blood Prince before he, Draco, and the rest of the Death Eaters escape.\n\nAfter Dumbledore's funeral, Harry decides to break up with Ginny, saying she would be in danger should their relationship continue. Later, Harry finds out the locket is not the real Horcrux. The fake Horcrux contains a note from someone named \"[[Death Eater#Regulus Black|R.A.B.]]\". Harry is devastated by Dumbledore's death, and he tells his friends he will not return to Hogwarts. Instead, he says he will spend the next year searching out Voldemort's Horcruxes. Ron and Hermione insist on joining him in destroying Lord Voldemort for good.\n\n==Development==\n===Franchise===\n''Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince'' is the sixth book in the [[Harry Potter|Harry Potter series]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/cbbcnews/hi/newsid_6280000/newsid_6282500/6282542.stm|title=Book 6 \u2013 The Half-Blood Prince|publisher=CBBC Newsround|accessdate=23 March 2011|date=10 July 2007|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227001235/http://news.bbc.co.uk/cbbcnews/hi/newsid_6280000/newsid_6282500/6282542.stm|archivedate=27 February 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The first book in the series, ''[[Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone]]'', was first published by Bloomsbury in 1997, with an initial print-run of 500 copies in hardback, 300 of which were distributed to libraries.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tomfolio.com/PublisherInfo/HarryPotter.asp |title=The Phenomenon of Harry Potter |last=Elisco |first=Lester |date=2000\u20132009 |publisher=TomFolio.com |accessdate=22 January 2009 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090412015849/http://www.tomfolio.com/PublisherInfo/HarryPotter.asp |archivedate=12 April 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> By the end of 1997, the UK edition won a [[National Book Award]] and a gold medal in the 9-&nbsp;to&nbsp;11-year-olds category of the [[Nestl\u00e9 Smarties Book Prize]].<ref>{{cite journal |last=Knapp |first=N.F. |year=2003 |title=In Defense of Harry Potter: An Apologia |journal=School Libraries Worldwide |publisher=International Association of School Librarianship |volume=9 |issue=1 |pages=78\u201391 |url=http://www.iasl-online.org/files/jan03-knapp.pdf |accessdate=14 May 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110309051050/http://www.iasl-online.org/files/jan03-knapp.pdf |archivedate=9 March 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The second book, ''[[Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets]]'', was originally published in the UK on 2 July 1998 and in the US on 2 June 1999.<ref name=\"Harry Potter UK Release Dates\">{{cite news |url=https://www.thestar.com/entertainment/article/235354 |title=A Potter timeline for muggles |date=14 July 2007 |work=Toronto Star |accessdate=27 September 2008 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081220001353/http://www.thestar.com/entertainment/article/235354 |archivedate=20 December 2008 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref name=\"Harry Potter US&nbsp;\u2014 Scholastic\">{{cite web|url=http://www.scholastic.com/harrypotter/books/author/index.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070604101828/http://www.scholastic.com/harrypotter/books/author/index.htm|archivedate=4 June 2007 |title=Harry Potter: Meet J.K.

It was certified Gold in the United States for selling combined sales and track-equivalent streams units of 500,000. The group's extended play, [[Better Together (EP)|''Better Together'']] peaked at number six on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] and number 18 in New Zealand, charting in both countries similar to the group's lead single. As part of the promotion for ''Better Together'', four other versions were released of the extended play, including an acoustic release, a Spanish-language acoustic and a standard Spanish-language translated version as well as a remix edition. The four former EPs were released in a 4-CD bundle titled ''Better Together: The Deluxe Edition'', directly from Fifth Harmony's official store; it also included a download code for the latter remix EP, as it was not available physically. In [[Walmart]] exclusively, the ''Juntos'' and ''Juntos Acoustic'' EPs were bundled together, while at [[Target Corporation|Target]], \"One Wish\" was included as a bonus track on the original version; meanwhile, the iTunes edition of the original EP included \"[[Me & My Girls]]\", which the group performed in 2013 as guests on the [[The X Factor (U.S. season 3)|third season]] of ''The X Factor'', and served as a promotional single for the EP.\n\nThe group's debut studio album, ''[[Reflection (Fifth Harmony album)|Reflection]]'' was released on February 2015, and debuted at number five on the ''Billboard 200''. Elsewhere, the album peaked within the top ten of Canada, Brazil and Spain while reaching the top thirty in ten additional countries. The lead single from the album, \"[[Boss (Fifth Harmony song)|Boss]]\", debuted at number 43 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100, earning the group their first top fifty entry. It also became the group's first single entry in the United Kingdom, charting at 21 as well as charting in the top forty of three additional countries. The following single, \"[[Sledgehammer (Fifth Harmony song)|Sledgehammer]]\" reached number 40, earning them their first top forty entry and made its first entry in the [[Adult Pop Songs]] chart, peaking at number 36. Since their release, both songs have been certified Platinum by the [[Recording Industry Association of America]]. The group's third and final single, \"[[Worth It]]\" featuring American rapper [[Kid Ink]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop-shop/6641998/fifth-harmony-worth-it-podcast-interview|title=Fifth Harmony Are 'Kind of Surprised' that 'Worth It' is Now Their Biggest Hit|work=Billboard|last=Lipshutz|first=Jason|date=July 24, 2015|accessdate=January 13, 2016}}</ref> debuted at number 82 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100, becoming a [[sleeper hit]] and staying in the charts for twenty-three weeks before peaking at number 12, earning Fifth Harmony their first top twenty entry in the United States.

Since its release, the song has been certified triple-platinum in the United States, double-platinum in Australia and Canada and platinum in five other countries.

It was subsequently released a month before the film's premiere date and used in both the trailer and the film. The following year, the group released their lead single from their sophomore studio album, ''[[7/27]]'', titled \"[[Work from Home]]\". The song would become the group's highest charting single, topping the charts in New Zealand, the Netherlands, and Brazil, and reaching the top ten in fourteen additional countries. In the United States, the song debuted at number 12 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100 before reaching its peak at number four after charting for thirteen weeks, beating the previous peak that was upheld by their single, \"Worth It\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/6898390/rihanna-hot-100-third-week-kelly-clarkson-top-10|title=Rihanna Tops Hot 100 for Third Week, Kelly Clarkson Debuts in Top 10|work=Billboard|date=March 7, 2016|accessdate=March 30, 2016|author=Trust, Gary}}</ref><ref name=\"US peak\">{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/chart-beat/7386139/drake-one-dance-hot-100-ariana-grande-dangerous|title=Drake's 'One Dance' Holds Atop Hot 100, Ariana Grande's 'Dangerous Woman' Returns to Top 10|work=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]|accessdate=June 1, 2016}}</ref> The song earned the group several certifications, including Diamond in Brazil and France, Quintuple Platinum in the US, Canada, and Australia, and Double Platinum in eight additional countries.

The film was adapted from the 1992 novel of the same name by [[Terry McMillan]]. [[Lela Rochon]], [[Loretta Devine]], [[Dennis Haysbert]], [[Michael Beach]], [[Gregory Hines]], [[Donald Faison]], and [[Mykelti Williamson]] rounded out the rest of the cast. The original music score was composed by [[Babyface (musician)|Kenneth \"Babyface\" Edmonds]]. The story centers on four women living in the [[Phoenix, Arizona]] area and their relationships with men and one another. All of them are \"holding their breath\" until the day they can feel comfortable in a committed relationship with a man.\n\n==Plot==\n''Waiting to Exhale'' is a story about four black women who are good friends: Savannah, Robin, Bernadine, and Gloria. The four women get together frequently to provide support, and to listen to each other vent about life and love. They all want to be in a couple but they all have difficulties finding a good man.\n\nSavannah \"'Vannah\" Jackson is a successful television producer who believes that one day her married lover will leave his wife for her. She later realizes he will never leave his wife, and that she must find her own man who will love her for who she really is.\n\nBernadine \"Bernie\" Harris had abandoned her own career dream of having a catering business\u2014instead she raised a family and supported her husband, who then announces he is leaving her for a white woman he works with.\n\nRobin Stokes is a high-powered executive, and the long-time mistress of married Russell. She has problems finding someone suitable after she dumps Russell.\n\nGloria \"Glo\" Matthews is a beauty salon owner and a single mother. Her ex-husband, who is also the father of her son, tells her he was always bisexual and now realizes he is actually gay. Gloria eventually falls in love with a new neighbor, Marvin King.\n\nThe situations all resolve themselves for the better. Savannah ends up dumping her married lover for good. Bernadine gets a large divorce settlement from her ex-husband. She finds love with a widowed father who is a [[civil rights]] [[Lawyer|attorney]] and who encourages Bernie to pursue her catering dream.\n\nRobin ends up pregnant by her married lover, but dumps him, and chooses to raise the baby on her own.\n\nGloria learns not to be so overprotective to her son. She lets him go on an \"[[Up With People]]\" trip to [[Spain]]. She apologizes to her neighbor for snapping at him when he suggested that she should let her son grow up and experience the world, and she finds love while learning to take care of herself rather than being overly self-sacrificing in her devotion to her son and her business.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Whitney Houston]] as Savannah \"Vannah\" Jackson. Savannah is a Successful local TV/Entertainment Producer who after few failed relationships, decides to move from Denver, Colorado to Phoenix, Arizona, where she is reunited with her College Bestfriend/Roommate, Bernadine. While trying to navigate a successful Production career, an aging mother, she dabbles into relationships including an on/off courtship with a married businessman, Kenneth, played by [[Dennis Haysbert]].\n* [[Angela Bassett]] as Bernadine \"Bernie\" Harris. Savannah and Bernadine have been best friends since [[college]]. She vents her anger on John by burning his clothes and car and selling the remainder of his personal items for $1 apiece.<ref>{{cite news|title= Breathing Easier: 'Waiting to Exhale' Role Has Given Lela Rochon's Career a Dose of Fresh Air|newspaper= [[The Los Angeles Times]]|date=1995-12-18|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1995-12-18/entertainment/ca-15267_1_angela-bassett|accessdate=2010-12-22|first=Gene|last=Seymour}}</ref>  \n* [[Lela Rochon]] as Robin Stokes.

The film was adapted from the 1992 novel of the same name by [[Terry McMillan]]. [[Lela Rochon]], [[Loretta Devine]], [[Dennis Haysbert]], [[Michael Beach]], [[Gregory Hines]], [[Donald Faison]], and [[Mykelti Williamson]] rounded out the rest of the cast. The original music score was composed by [[Babyface (musician)|Kenneth \"Babyface\" Edmonds]]. The story centers on four women living in the [[Phoenix, Arizona]] area and their relationships with men and one another. All of them are \"holding their breath\" until the day they can feel comfortable in a committed relationship with a man.\n\n==Plot==\n''Waiting to Exhale'' is a story about four black women who are good friends: Savannah, Robin, Bernadine, and Gloria. The four women get together frequently to provide support, and to listen to each other vent about life and love. They all want to be in a couple but they all have difficulties finding a good man.\n\nSavannah \"'Vannah\" Jackson is a successful television producer who believes that one day her married lover will leave his wife for her. She later realizes he will never leave his wife, and that she must find her own man who will love her for who she really is.\n\nBernadine \"Bernie\" Harris had abandoned her own career dream of having a catering business\u2014instead she raised a family and supported her husband, who then announces he is leaving her for a white woman he works with.\n\nRobin Stokes is a high-powered executive, and the long-time mistress of married Russell. She has problems finding someone suitable after she dumps Russell.\n\nGloria \"Glo\" Matthews is a beauty salon owner and a single mother. Her ex-husband, who is also the father of her son, tells her he was always bisexual and now realizes he is actually gay. Gloria eventually falls in love with a new neighbor, Marvin King.\n\nThe situations all resolve themselves for the better. Savannah ends up dumping her married lover for good. Bernadine gets a large divorce settlement from her ex-husband. She finds love with a widowed father who is a [[civil rights]] [[Lawyer|attorney]] and who encourages Bernie to pursue her catering dream.\n\nRobin ends up pregnant by her married lover, but dumps him, and chooses to raise the baby on her own.\n\nGloria learns not to be so overprotective to her son. She lets him go on an \"[[Up With People]]\" trip to [[Spain]]. She apologizes to her neighbor for snapping at him when he suggested that she should let her son grow up and experience the world, and she finds love while learning to take care of herself rather than being overly self-sacrificing in her devotion to her son and her business.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Whitney Houston]] as Savannah \"Vannah\" Jackson. Savannah is a Successful local TV/Entertainment Producer who after few failed relationships, decides to move from Denver, Colorado to Phoenix, Arizona, where she is reunited with her College Bestfriend/Roommate, Bernadine. While trying to navigate a successful Production career, an aging mother, she dabbles into relationships including an on/off courtship with a married businessman, Kenneth, played by [[Dennis Haysbert]].\n* [[Angela Bassett]] as Bernadine \"Bernie\" Harris. Savannah and Bernadine have been best friends since [[college]]. She vents her anger on John by burning his clothes and car and selling the remainder of his personal items for $1 apiece.<ref>{{cite news|title= Breathing Easier: 'Waiting to Exhale' Role Has Given Lela Rochon's Career a Dose of Fresh Air|newspaper= [[The Los Angeles Times]]|date=1995-12-18|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1995-12-18/entertainment/ca-15267_1_angela-bassett|accessdate=2010-12-22|first=Gene|last=Seymour}}</ref>  \n* [[Lela Rochon]] as Robin Stokes.
