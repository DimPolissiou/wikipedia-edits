His step-father later moved in and his younger brother Michael was born with [[muscular dystrophy]] (MD). He died in 2001, aged one, which greatly affected Frampton and the family. Frampton attended [[Northampton Academy]] and in 2011 went on to attend [[Northampton College]], where he studied a Level 3 [[Business and Technology Education Council|BTEC]] in Music Technology.\n\nSlowthai frequently [[truancy|skipped school]] during his years at Northampton Academy, often spending time at a nearby underground \u201crecording studio\u201d at his friend's house, only stopping when his mother was forced to attend a compulsory court hearing. After college, Slowthai had multiple miscellaneous short stints in employment - he worked as a [[labourer]] and at a clothes shop before being sacked for breach of contract after he gave his friends employee benefits. After his dismissal, he focused entirely on music, downloading a copy of [[FL Studio]] and releasing numerous singles and an extended play under Bone Soda.\n\n== Music career ==\nThe name Slowthai originates from his childhood nickname; slow ty due to his slow speech and drawled tone.{{citation needed}} In 2016, he released his first single titled Jiggle and went on to release a string of singles via SoundCloud that were later removed.{{citation needed}}\n\nIn 2017, Slowthai partnered up with indie record label Bone Soda to release his I WISH I KNEW EP, Murder and T N Biscuits.{{citation needed}} Later in the same year, Slowthai signed his recording contract with Method Records and since has released his RUNT EP and debut studio album, ''[[Nothing Great About Britain]]'' which charted at number 9 on the [[Official Charts Company|Official Charts]] on the week of release<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.officialcharts.com/search/albums/nothing-great-about-britain/|title=nothing great about britain &#124; full Official Chart History &#124; Official Charts Company|website=www.officialcharts.com}}</ref>.\n\nIn addition to being included in the [[BBC]]'s [[Sound of...|Sound of 2019]] poll<ref name=\"soundof2019\" /> and ''[[NME]]'''s NME 100 list,<ref name=\"nme\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/blogs/nme-radar/the-nme-100-essential-new-artists-for-2019-2426835|title=The NME 100: Essential new artists for 2019|last=Smith|first=Thomas|date=2019-01-08|website=NME|language=en-US|access-date=2019-04-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190401175930/https://www.nme.com/blogs/nme-radar/the-nme-100-essential-new-artists-for-2019-2426835|archive-date=2019-04-01|url-status=live}}</ref> Slowthai has also received acclaim from publications such as ''[[DIY (magazine)|DIY]]'', [[Vevo]] and ''[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]''<ref name=\"diy\" /><ref name=\"vevo\" /><ref name=\"metro\" /> as well as having his debut album nominated for a [[Mercury Prize|Mercury Music Prize]].\n\nSlowthai contributed additional vocals on the song \"What's Good\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/here-are-the-full-credits-for-tyler-the-creators-new-album-igor-kanye-solange-pharrell-more/|title=Here Are the Full Credits for Tyler, the Creator\u2019s New Album IGOR: Kanye, Solange, Pharrell, More|website=Pitchfork}}</ref> from [[Tyler, the Creator|Tyler, The Creator's]] album ''[[Igor (album)|Igor]]''.

The album was nominated for the [[Mercury Prize]]; at Slowthai\u2019s 2019 Mercury Prize ceremony performance, he held a fake severed head of British Prime Minister [[Boris Johnson]] on stage, generating much controversy.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://news.sky.com/story/rapper-slowthai-holds-up-fake-boris-johnson-head-on-stage-at-mercury-prize-ceremony-11814567|title=Rapper slowthai holds up fake Boris Johnson head on stage at Mercury Prize ceremony|website=Sky News|language=en|access-date=2019-09-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191206151253/https://news.sky.com/story/rapper-slowthai-holds-up-fake-boris-johnson-head-on-stage-at-mercury-prize-ceremony-11814567|archive-date=2019-12-06|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\n\n{{Section refimprove|date=February 2019}}\nSlowthai was born on 18 December 1994 in [[Northampton]] to a teenage mother of mixed [[Barbados|Bajan]] and [[Ireland|Irish]] descent, he was raised by his single mother in a council estate with his sister in the Lings area of Northampton. His step-father later moved in and his younger brother Michael was born with [[muscular dystrophy]] (MD). He died in 2001, aged one, which greatly affected Frampton and the family. Frampton attended [[Northampton Academy]] and in 2011 went on to attend [[Northampton College]], where he studied a Level 3 [[Business and Technology Education Council|BTEC]] in Music Technology.\n\nSlowthai frequently [[truancy|skipped school]] during his years at Northampton Academy, often spending time at a nearby underground \u201crecording studio\u201d at his friend's house, only stopping when his mother was forced to attend a compulsory court hearing. After college, Slowthai had multiple miscellaneous short stints in employment - he worked as a [[labourer]] and at a clothes shop before being sacked for breach of contract after he gave his friends employee benefits. After his dismissal, he focused entirely on music, downloading a copy of [[FL Studio]] and releasing numerous singles and an extended play under Bone Soda.\n\n== Music career ==\nThe name Slowthai originates from his childhood nickname; slow ty due to his slow speech and drawled tone.{{citation needed}} In 2016, he released his first single titled Jiggle and went on to release a string of singles via SoundCloud that were later removed.{{citation needed}}\n\nIn 2017, Slowthai partnered up with indie record label Bone Soda to release his I WISH I KNEW EP, Murder and T N Biscuits.{{citation needed}} Later in the same year, Slowthai signed his recording contract with Method Records and since has released his RUNT EP and debut studio album, ''[[Nothing Great About Britain]]'' which charted at number 9 on the [[Official Charts Company|Official Charts]] on the week of release<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.officialcharts.com/search/albums/nothing-great-about-britain/|title=nothing great about britain &#124; full Official Chart History &#124; Official Charts Company|website=www.officialcharts.com}}</ref>.\n\nIn addition to being included in the [[BBC]]'s [[Sound of...|Sound of 2019]] poll<ref name=\"soundof2019\" /> and ''[[NME]]'''s NME 100 list,<ref name=\"nme\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.nme.com/blogs/nme-radar/the-nme-100-essential-new-artists-for-2019-2426835|title=The NME 100: Essential new artists for 2019|last=Smith|first=Thomas|date=2019-01-08|website=NME|language=en-US|access-date=2019-04-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190401175930/https://www.nme.com/blogs/nme-radar/the-nme-100-essential-new-artists-for-2019-2426835|archive-date=2019-04-01|url-status=live}}</ref> Slowthai has also received acclaim from publications such as ''[[DIY (magazine)|DIY]]'', [[Vevo]] and ''[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]''<ref name=\"diy\" /><ref name=\"vevo\" /><ref name=\"metro\" /> as well as having his debut album nominated for a [[Mercury Prize|Mercury Music Prize]].\n\nSlowthai contributed additional vocals on the song \"What's Good\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://pitchfork.com/news/here-are-the-full-credits-for-tyler-the-creators-new-album-igor-kanye-solange-pharrell-more/|title=Here Are the Full Credits for Tyler, the Creator\u2019s New Album IGOR: Kanye, Solange, Pharrell, More|website=Pitchfork}}</ref> from [[Tyler, the Creator|Tyler, The Creator's]] album ''[[Igor (album)|Igor]]''.

[http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Videotelephony Videotelephony], McGraw-Hill, 2002. Retrieved from the FreeDictionary.com website, January 9, 2010</ref> A '''videophone''' is a [[telephone]] with a [[Display device|video display]], capable of simultaneous video and audio for communication between people in [[Real-time computing|real time]]. '''Videoconferencing''' implies the use of this technology for a group or organizational meeting rather than for individuals, in a '''videoconference'''.<ref name=\"Mulbach-1995c\">Mulbach et al, 1995. pg. 291.</ref> [[Telepresence]] may refer either to a high-quality videotelephony system (where the goal is to create the illusion that remote participants are in the same room) or to meetup technology, which goes beyond video into robotics (such as moving around the room or physically manipulating objects). Videoconferencing has also been called \"visual collaboration\" and is a type of [[groupware]].\n\nWhile development of video conferencing started in the late 19th century, the technology only became available to the public starting in the 1930s. These early demonstrations were installed at \"booths\" in post offices and shown at various world expositions. It took until 1970 for AT&T to launch the first true video conferencing system, wherein anyone could subscribe to the service and have the technology in their home or office. Videotelephony also included \"image phones\" which would exchange still images between units every few seconds over conventional [[plain old telephone service]] (POTS) lines, essentially the same as [[Slow-scan television|slow-scan TV]]. The development of advanced [[codec|video codecs]], more powerful [[CPU]]s, and high-bandwidth [[internet Protocol|Internet telecommunication services]] in the late 1990s allowed videophones to provide high quality low-cost colour service between users almost any place in the world where the Internet is available.\n\nAlthough not as widely used in everyday communications as audio-only and text communication, useful applications include [[sign language]] transmission for [[deaf]] and [[Speech disorder|speech-impaired]] people, [[distance education]], [[telemedicine]], and overcoming [[disability|mobility issues]]. It is also used in commercial and corporate settings to facilitate meetings and conferences, typically between parties that already have established relationships. [[News media]] organizations have begun to use desktop technologies like [[Skype]] to provide higher-quality audio than the celluar phone network, and video links at much lower cost than sending professional equipment or using a professional studio. More popular videotelephony technologies use the Internet rather than the traditional landline phone network, even accounting for modern digital packetized phone network protocols, and even though videotelephony software commonly runs on [[smartphones]].\n\n== History ==\n\n{{Main|History of videotelephony}}\n[[File:France in XXI Century. Correspondance cinema.jpg|thumb|Video telephony predicted to be in use by the year 2000, as envisioned in 1910 (artist's conception)]]\n[[Image:Bell telephone magazine (1922) (14756466975).jpg|thumb|Video telephone booth, 1930]]\n\nThe concept of videotelephony was first conceived in the late 1870s both in the United States and in Europe, although the basic sciences to permit its very earliest trials would take nearly a half century to be discovered.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} This was first embodied in the device which came to be known as the video telephone, or videophone, and it evolved from intensive research and experimentation in several telecommunication fields, notably [[electrical telegraphy]], [[telephony]], [[radio]], and [[television]].\n\nSimple analog videophone communication could be established as early as the invention of the [[television]]. Such an antecedent usually consisted of two [[closed-circuit television]] systems connected via [[Coaxial cable|coax cable]] or [[radio]]. An example of that was the German Reich Postzentralamt (post office) video telephone network serving Berlin and several German cities via coaxial cables between 1936 and 1940.<ref>\"German Postoffice To Use Television\u2013Telephone For Its Communication System\", (Associated Press) The Evening Independent, St. Petersburg, Fl, September 1, 1934</ref><ref>Peters, C. Brooks, \"Talks On 'See-Phone': Television Applied to German Telephones Enables Speakers to See Each Other{{nbsp}}...\", The New York Times, September 18, 1938</ref>\n\nThe development of video conferencing as a subscription service started in the latter half of the 1920s in the United Kingdom and the United States, spurred notably by [[John Logie Baird]] and [[Bell Labs|AT&T's Bell Labs]]. This occurred in part, at least with AT&T, to serve as an adjunct supplementing the use of the telephone. A number of organizations believed that videotelephony would be superior to plain voice communications. Attempts at using normal [[telephony]] networks to transmit slow-scan video, such as the first systems developed by [[AT&T Corporation]], first researched in the 1950s, failed mostly due to the poor picture quality and the lack of efficient video [[Video compression|compression]] techniques. \n\nThe first manned [[space flight]]s, [[NASA]] used two radio-frequency ([[UHF]] or [[VHF]]) video links, one in each direction. TV channels routinely use this type of videotelephony when reporting from distant locations. The news media were to become regular users of mobile links to [[satellite]]s using specially equipped trucks, and much later via special satellite videophones in a briefcase. This technique was very expensive, though, and could not be used for applications such as [[telemedicine]], [[distance education]], and business meetings. \n\nDecades of research and development culminated in the 1970 commercial launch of AT&T's Picturephone service, available in select cities. However, the system was a commercial failure, chiefly due to consumer apathy, high subscription costs, and lack of [[network effect]]\u2014with only a few hundred Picturephones in the world, users had extremely few contacts they could actually call, and [[interoperability]] with other videophone systems would not exist for decades. \n[[File:On Line System Videoconferencing FJCC 1968.jpg|thumb|Multiple user videoconferencing first being demonstrated with [[Stanford Research Institute]]'s [[NLS (computer system)|NLS computer technology]] (1968)]]\n\nVery expensive [[videoconferencing]] systems continued to evolve throughout the 1980s and 1990s. Proprietary equipment, software, and network requirements gave way to standards-based technologies that were available for anyone to purchase at a reasonable cost. Only in the late 20th century with the advent of powerful [[video codec]]s combined with high-speed [[Internet access|Internet broadband]] and [[Integrated Services Digital Network|ISDN]] service did videotelephony become a practical technology for regular use.\n\n=== Digital videotelephony ===\n\nPractical digital videotelephony was made possible only with advances in [[video compression]], due to the impractically high bandwidth requirements of [[uncompressed video]]. To achieve [[Video Graphics Array]] (VGA) quality video ([[480p]] resolution and [[256 colors]]) with raw uncompressed video, it would require a bandwidth of over 92{{nbsp}}[[Mbps]].<ref name=\"Belmudez\">{{cite book |last1=Belmudez |first1=Benjamin |title=Audiovisual Quality Assessment and Prediction for Videotelephony |date=2014 |publisher=Springer |isbn=9783319141664 |pages=11\u201313 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ULTzBQAAQBAJ}}</ref> The most important compression technique that enabled practical digital videotelephony and videoconferencing is the [[discrete cosine transform]] (DCT).<ref name=\"Belmudez\"/><ref name=\"Huang\">{{cite book |last1=Huang |first1=Hsiang-Cheh |last2=Fang |first2=Wai-Chi |title=Intelligent Multimedia Data Hiding: New Directions |date=2007 |publisher=Springer |isbn=9783540711698 |page=41 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=67W5BQAAQBAJ&pg=PA41}}</ref> The DCT, a form of [[lossy compression]], was conceived in 1972 by [[N.

During this time, there was also research into other forms of digital video and audio communication. Many of these technologies, such as the [[Media space]], are not as widely used today as videoconferencing but were still an important area of research.<ref>Robert Stults, Media Space, Xerox PARC, Palo Alto, CA, 1986.</ref><ref>Harrison, Steve.

In 1992 [[CU-SeeMe]] was developed at Cornell by Tim Dorcey et al.

In the present day standalone videophones and [[UMTS]] video-enabled [[mobile phone]]s are usually used on a person-to-person basis.\n\n'''Videoconferencing''' saw its earliest use with AT&T's Picturephone service in the early 1970s. Transmissions were analog over short distances, but converted to digital forms for longer calls, again using telephone transmission technology. Popular corporate video-conferencing systems in the present day have migrated almost exclusively to digital [[ISDN]] and [[Internet Protocol|IP]] transmission modes due to the need to convey the very large amounts of data generated by their cameras and microphones. These systems are often intended for use in conference mode, that is by many people in several different locations, all of whom can be viewed by every participant at each location.\n\n[[Telepresence]] systems are a newer, more advanced subset of videoconferencing systems, meant to allow higher degrees of video and audio fidelity. Such high-end systems are typically deployed in corporate settings.\n\n[[Mobile collaboration]] systems are another recent development, combining the use of video, audio, and on-screen drawing capabilities using newest generation [[Mobile device|hand-held electronic devices]] broadcasting over secure networks, enabling multi-party conferencing in real time, independent of location.\n\nA more recent technology encompassing these functions is TV cams. TV cams enable people to make video \"phone\" calls using video calling services, like Skype on their TV, without using a PC connection. TV cams are specially designed video cameras that feed images in real time to another TV camera or other compatible computing devices like smartphones, tablets and computers.\n\n''[[Webcam]]s'' are popular, relatively low cost devices which can provide live video and audio streams via [[personal computer]]s, and can be used with many [[List of video telecommunication services and product brands#Software Client brands|software clients]] for both video calls and videoconferencing.<ref name=\"books.google.com\">Solomon Negash, Michael E.

The earliest standalone models operated over either [[plain old telephone service]] (POTS) lines on the [[PSTN]] telephone networks or more expensive [[ISDN]] lines, while newer models have largely migrated to [[Internet protocol]] line service for higher image resolutions and sound quality. Quality of service for standalone videophones can vary from low to high;\n* Huddle room or all-in-one systems \u2014low to midrange cost, newer endpoint category based on standard videoconferencing systems, but defined by the camera, microphone(s), speakers, and codec contained in a single piece of hardware. Typically used in small to medium spaces where [[beamforming]] [[microphone array]]s located in the system are sufficient, in lieu of table or ceiling microphones in closer proximity to the in room participants. Quality of service is comparable to standard videoconferencing systems, varying from moderate to high. Some manufacturers' huddle room systems do not include the codec within the soundbar shaped unit, rather only camera, microphone, and speakers. These systems are usually still classified as huddle room systems, but, like webcams, rely on a USB connection to an external device, usually a PC, to process the video codec responsibilities. \n* [[Videoconferencing|Videoconferencing systems]]\u2014midrange cost, usually utilizing [[multipoint control unit]]s or other bridging services to allow multiple parties on a videoconference calls.

Sometimes it is simply not possible or practical to have face-to-face meetings with two or more people. Sometimes a telephone conversation or conference call is adequate. Other times, [[e-mail]] exchanges are adequate. However, videoconferencing adds another possible alternative, and can be considered when:\n* A live conversation is needed\n* Non-verbal (visual) information is an important component of the conversation\n* The parties of the conversation can't physically come to the same location\n* The expense or time of travel is a consideration\n\n[[Bill Gates]] said in 2001 that he used video conferencing \"three or four times a year\", because digital scheduling was difficult and \"if the overhead is super high, then you might as well just have a face-to-face meeting\".<ref name=\"millergates20010904\">{{Cite interview |last=Gates |first=Bill |interviewer=Michael J.

Some telepresence systems have cameras located in the screens that reduce the amount of [[parallax]] observed by the users. This issue is also being addressed through research that generates a synthetic image with eye contact using stereo reconstruction.<ref>Computer vision approaches to achieving eye contact appeared in the 1990s, such as [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=260136&coll=portal&dl=ACM&CFID=72199399&CFTOKEN=47661501 Teleconferencing Eye Contact Using a Virtual Camera], ACM CHI 1993.

This technique eliminates the need for special cameras or image processing.<ref>[http://www.google.com/patents?id=GqkaAAAAEBAJ&printsec=abstract&zoom=4#v=onepage Google Patent]</ref>\n* '''Appearance consciousness:''' A second psychological problem with videoconferencing is being on camera, with the video stream possibly even being recorded. The burden of presenting an acceptable on-screen appearance is not present in audio-only communication. Early studies by Alphonse Chapanis found that the addition of video actually impaired communication, possibly because of the consciousness of being on camera.<ref>{{cite journal| title=Studies in interactive communication II: The effects of four communication modes on the linguistic performance of teams during cooperative problem solving| last1=Chapanis| first1=A| last2=Ochsman| first2=R| last3=Parrish| first3=R| journal=Human Factors| year=1977| volume=19| issue=2| pages=101\u2013126| doi=10.1177/001872087701900201}}</ref>\n* '''Signal latency''': The information transport of digital signals in many steps need time. In a telecommunicated conversation, an increased [[latency (engineering)|latency]] (time lag) larger than about 150\u2013300 ms becomes noticeable and is soon observed as unnatural and distracting. Therefore, next to a stable large bandwidth, a small [[Internet Control Message Protocol|total round-trip time]] is another major technical requirement for the communication channel for interactive videoconferencing.<ref name=\"Percy\">Percy, Alan. [http://www.telephonyworld.com/training/brooktrout/iptel_latency_wp.html ''Understanding Latency''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514133416/http://www.telephonyworld.com/training/brooktrout/iptel_latency_wp.html |date=2013-05-14 }}</ref>\n* '''Bandwidth and quality of service''': In some countries it is difficult or expensive to get a high quality connection that is fast enough for good-quality video conferencing. Technologies such as [[ADSL]] are usually provided as two separate lines (for uplink/downlink) because each has limited upload speeds and cannot upload and download simultaneously at full speed. As Internet speeds increase higher quality and high definition video conferencing will become more readily available.\n* '''Complexity of systems''': Most users are not technical and want a simple interface. In hardware systems, an unplugged cord or a dead battery in a remote control is seen as failure, contributing to a perceived unreliability. Successful systems are backed by support teams who can pro-actively support and provide fast assistance when required.\n* '''Perceived lack of interoperability''': not all systems can readily interconnect, for example ISDN and IP systems require a gateway. Popular software solutions cannot easily connect to hardware systems. Some systems use different standards, features, and qualities which can require additional configuration when connecting to dissimilar systems. Free software systems circumvent this limitation by making it relatively easy for a single user to communicate over multiple incompatible platforms.\n* '''Expense of commercial systems''': well-designed [[telepresence]] systems require specially designed rooms which can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars to fit out their rooms with codecs, integration equipment (such as [[Multipoint Control Unit]]s), high fidelity sound systems, and furniture. Monthly charges may also be required for bridging services and high capacity broadband service.\n\nThese are some of the reasons many systems are often used for internal corporate use only, as they are less likely to result in lost sales. One alternative to companies lacking dedicated facilities is the [[List of video telecommunication services and product brands#Public videoconferencing facilities|rental of videoconferencing-equipped meeting rooms]] in cities around the world. Clients can book rooms and turn up for the meeting, with all technical aspects being prearranged and support being readily available if needed. The issue of eye-contact may be solved with advancing technology, including smartphones which have the screen and camera in essentially the same place. The ubiquity of [[smartphone]]s, [[tablet computer]]s, and computers with built-in audio and webcams in developed countries obviates the need to buy expensive hardware.\n\n== Technology ==\n\n{{more citations needed section|date=February 2013}}\n\n===Components and types===\n\n[[File:Polycom VSX 7000 with 2 video conferencing screens.JPG|thumb|'''Dual display''': An older [[Polycom VSX 7000]] system and camera used for videoconferencing, with two displays for simultaneous broadcast from separate locations]]\n[[File:Room220.jpg|thumb|Components of a [[Lifesize communications|LifeSize Communications]] Room 220 high-definition multipoint system]]\n[[File:GoogleHangoutsMeeting.jpg|thumb|A video conference meeting facilitated by [[Google Hangouts]]]]\n\nThe core technology used in a videotelephony system is digital compression of audio and video streams in real time. The hardware or [[software]] that performs compression is called a [[codec]] (coder/decoder). Compression rates of up to 1:500 can be achieved. The resulting digital stream of 1s and 0s is subdivided into labeled [[Packet (information technology)|packets]], which are then transmitted through a [[digital network]] of some kind (usually [[ISDN]] or [[Internet Protocol|IP]]).\n\nThe other components required for a videoconferencing system include:\n* '''Video input''': ([[Pan\u2013tilt\u2013zoom camera|PTZ]] / [[360-degree video|360\u00b0]] / [[Fisheye lens|Fisheye]]) [[video camera]], or [[webcam]]\n* '''Video output''': [[Computer display|computer monitor]], [[television]], or [[Video projector|projector]]\n* '''Audio input''': [[microphone]]s, CD/DVD player, cassette player, or any other source of PreAmp audio outlet.\n* '''Audio output''': usually [[loudspeaker]]s associated with the display device or telephone\n* '''Data transfer''': analog or digital telephone network, [[Local area network|LAN]], or [[Internet]]\n* '''Computer''': a data processing unit that ties together the other components, does the compressing and decompressing, and initiates and maintains the data linkage via the network.\n\nThere are basically two kinds of videoconferencing and videophone systems:\n\n# '''Dedicated systems''' have all required components packaged into a single piece of equipment, usually a console with a high quality [[remote control]]led video camera. These cameras can be controlled at a distance to pan left and right, tilt up and down, and zoom. They became known as PTZ cameras. The console contains all electrical interfaces, the control computer, and the software or hardware-based codec. Omnidirectional microphones are connected to the console, as well as a TV monitor with loudspeakers and/or a [[video projector]]. There are several types of dedicated videoconferencing devices:\n## Large group videoconferencing are built-in, large, expensive devices used for large rooms such as conference rooms and auditoriums.\n## Small group videoconferencing are either non-portable or portable, smaller, less expensive devices used for small meeting rooms.\n## Individual videoconferencing are usually portable devices, meant for single users, and have fixed cameras, microphones, and loudspeakers integrated into the console.\n# '''Desktop systems''' are add-ons (hardware boards or software codec) to normal PCs and laptops, transforming them into videoconferencing devices. A range of different cameras and microphones can be used with the codec, which contains the necessary codec and transmission interfaces. Most of the desktops systems work with the [[H.323]] standard.\n# '''WebRTC Platforms''' are video conferencing solutions that are not resident by using a software application but is available through the standard web browser. Solutions such as Adobe Connect and Cisco WebEX can be accessed by going to a URL sent by the meeting organizer and various degrees of security can be attached to the virtual \"room\". Often the user will be required to download a piece of software, called an \"Add In\" to enable the browser to access the local camera, microphone and establish a connection to the meeting. WebRTC technology doesn't require any software or Add On installation, instead a WebRTC compliant internet browser itself acts as a client to facilitate 1-to-1 and 1-to-many videoconferencing calls. Several enhanced flavours of WebRTC technology are being provided by Third Party vendors.\n\n=== Videoconferencing modes ===\n\nVideoconferencing systems use two methods to determine which video feed or feeds to display.\n\n''Continuous Presence'' simply displays all participants at the same time,<ref name=\"V&VCF\" /> usually with the exception that the viewer either does not see their own feed, or sees their own feed in miniature.\n\n''Voice-Activated Switch'' selectively chooses a feed to display at each endpoint, with the goal of showing the person who is currently speaking. This is done by choosing the feed (other than the viewer) which has the loudest audio input (perhaps with some filtering to avoid switching for very short-lived volume spikes). Often if no remote parties are currently speaking, the feed with the last speaker remains on the screen.\n\n=== Echo Cancellation ===\n\n[[echo cancellation|Acoustic echo cancellation]] (AEC) is a processing [[algorithm]] that uses the knowledge of audio output to monitor audio input and filter from it noises that echo back after some time delay. If unattended, these echoes can be re-amplified several times, leading to problems including:\n* The remote party hearing their own voice coming back at them (usually significantly delayed)\n# Strong [[reverberation]], which makes the voice channel useless\n# Howling created by feedback\n\nEcho cancellation is a processor-intensive task that usually works over a narrow range of sound delays.\n\n=== Bandwidth requirements ===\n\n[[File:Bildtelefon T-View 100.JPG|thumb|left|'''[[Deutsche Telekom]] T-View 100''' [[ISDN]]-type videophone meant for home offices and small businesses, with a lens cover which can be rotated upward for privacy]]\n{{See also|Broadband Internet access}}\n\nVideophones have historically employed a variety of transmission and reception bandwidths, which can be understood as data transmission speeds. The lower the transmission/reception bandwidth, the lower the data transfer rate, resulting in a progressively limited and poorer image quality (i.e. lower resolution and/or frame rate). Data transfer rates and live video image quality are related, but are also subject to other factors such as [[Video compression|data compression techniques]]. Some early videophones employed very low data transmission rates with a resulting poor video quality.\n\n''Broadband bandwidth'' is often called \"''high-speed''\", because it usually has a high rate of data transmission. In general, any connection of 256 kbit/s (0.256 Mbit/s) or greater is more concisely considered broadband Internet. The [[International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication Standardization Sector]] (ITU-T) recommendation [[I.113]] has defined broadband as a transmission capacity at 1.5 to 2{{nbsp}}Mbit/s. The [[Federal Communications Commission]] (United States) definition of broadband is 25 Mbit/s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/01/29/f-c-c-sharply-increases-definition-of-broadband/?_r=0 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-03-23 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906004513/http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/01/29/f-c-c-sharply-increases-definition-of-broadband/?_r=0 |archivedate=2015-09-06 }}</ref>\n\nCurrently, adequate video for some purposes becomes possible at data rates lower than the ITU-T broadband definition, with rates of 768 kbit/s and 384 kbit/s used for some video conferencing applications, and rates as low as 100 kbit/s used for videophones using [[H.264|H.264/MPEG-4 AVC]] compression protocols. The newer [[MPEG-4]] [[video compression|video]] and [[Audio data compression|audio compression]] format can deliver high-quality video at 2{{nbsp}}Mbit/s, which is at the low end of [[cable modem]] and [[Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line|ADSL]] broadband performance.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}\n\n=== Standards ===\n\n[[File:TANDBERG E20.jpg|thumb|The [[Tandberg E20]] is an example of a [[Session Initiation Protocol|SIP]]-only device. Such devices need to route calls through a Video Communication Server to be able to reach [[H.323]] systems, a process known as \"interworking\" (2009).]]\n\nThe [[International Telecommunications Union]] (ITU) has three umbrellas of standards for videoconferencing:\n* ITU [[H.320]] is known as the standard for [[public switched telephone network]]s (PSTN) or videoconferencing over integrated services digital networks. While still prevalent in Europe, [[ISDN]] was never widely adopted in the United States and Canada.{{citation needed|date= March 2011}}\n* ITU [[H.264]] [[Scalable Video Coding]] (SVC) is a compression standard that enables videoconferencing systems to achieve highly error resilient [[Internet Protocol]] (IP) video transmissions over the public Internet without quality-of-service enhanced lines.<ref>[http://www.vidyo.com/comparison_video.html SVC vs. H.264/AVC Error Resilience] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090810075550/http://www.vidyo.com/comparison_video.html |date=August 10, 2009 }}</ref> This standard has enabled wide scale deployment of high definition desktop videoconferencing and made possible new architectures,<ref>[http://www.vidyo.com/whitepaper_info.html SVC White Papers] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100104232909/http://www.vidyo.com/whitepaper_info.html |date=January 4, 2010 }}</ref> which reduces latency between the transmitting sources and receivers, resulting in more fluid communication without pauses. In addition, an attractive factor for IP videoconferencing is that it is easier to set up for use along with [[web conferencing]] and [[data collaboration]]. These combined technologies enable users to have a richer [[multimedia]] environment for live meetings, collaboration and presentations.\n* ITU [[ITU-T V-Series Recommendations|V.80]]: videoconferencing is generally compatibilized with [[H.324]] standard point-to-point videotelephony over regular (POTS) phone lines.\n\nThe [[Unified Communications Interoperability Forum]] (UCIF), a non-profit alliance between communications vendors, launched in May 2010. The organization's vision is to maximize the interoperability of UC based on existing standards. Founding members of UCIF include [[Hewlett-Packard|HP]], [[Microsoft]], [[Polycom]], [[Logitech]]/[[LifeSize|LifeSize Communications]], and [[Juniper Networks]].<ref>[http://blogs.technet.com/brettjo/archive/2010/05/19/unified-communications-interoperability-forum-ucif.aspx Unified Communications Interoperability Forum]</ref><ref>[https://www.pcworld.com/article/196640/collaboration_vendors_join_for_interoperability.html Collaboration Vendors Join for Interoperability]</ref>\n\n=== Call setup ===\n\nVideoconferencing in the late 20th century was limited to the [[H.323]] protocol (notably Cisco's [[Skinny Client Control Protocol|SCCP]] implementation was an exception), but newer videophones often use [[Session Initiation Protocol|SIP]], which is often easier to set up in home networking environments.<ref>\n\nRFC 4168, ''The Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) as a Transport for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)'', IETF, The Internet Society (2005)\n\n</ref> It is a text-based protocol, incorporating many elements of the [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol]] (HTTP) and the [[Simple Mail Transfer Protocol]] (SMTP).<ref>\n\n {{cite book\n | author = Johnston, Alan B.\n | year = 2004\n | title = SIP: Understanding the Session Initiation Protocol, Second Edition\n | publisher = Artech House\n | isbn = 978-1-58053-168-9}}\n\n</ref> H.323 is still used, but more commonly for business videoconferencing, while SIP is more commonly used in personal consumer videophones. A number of call-setup methods based on [[instant messaging]] protocols such as [[Skype]] also now provide video.\n\nAnother protocol used by videophones is [[H.324]], which mixes call setup and video compression. Videophones that work on regular phone lines typically use H.324, but the bandwidth is limited by the modem to around 33 kbit/s, limiting the video quality and frame rate. A slightly modified version of H.324 called [[3G-324M]] defined by [[3GPP]] is also used by some cellphones that allow video calls, typically for use only in [[UMTS]] networks.<ref name=\"IMTC\">\n\nIMTC.

It applied mostly to dedicated circuit-based switched network (point-to-point) connections of moderate or high bandwidth, such as through the medium-bandwidth [[ISDN]] digital phone protocol or a fractionated high bandwidth T1 lines.

Many in the industry have encountered both types of interface, and normally a graphical interface is encountered on a computer. User interfaces for conferencing have a number of different uses; they can be used for scheduling, setup, and making a videocall. Through the user interface the administrator is able to control the other three layers of the system.\n\nConference Control performs resource allocation, management, and routing. This layer along with the User Interface creates meetings (scheduled or unscheduled) or adds and removes participants from a conference.\n\nControl (Signaling) Plane contains the stacks that signal different endpoints to create a call and/or a conference. Signals can be, but aren't limited to, [[H.323]] and [[Session Initiation Protocol]] (SIP) Protocols. These signals control incoming and outgoing connections as well as session parameters.\n\nThe Media Plane controls the audio and video mixing and streaming. This layer manages Real-Time Transport Protocols, User Datagram Packets (UDP) and [[RTP Control Protocol|Real-Time Transport Control Protocol]] (RTCP). The RTP and UDP normally carry information such the payload type which is the type of codec, frame rate, video size, and many others. RTCP on the other hand acts as a quality control Protocol for detecting errors during streaming.<ref name=\"V&VCF\" />\n\n=== Multipoint videoconferencing ===\n\n{{Main|Multipoint Control Unit}}\n\nSimultaneous videoconferencing among three or more remote points is possible in a hardware-based system by means of a [[Multipoint Control Unit]] (MCU). This is a bridge that interconnects calls from several sources (in a similar way to the audio conference call). All parties call the MCU, or the MCU can also call the parties which are going to participate, in sequence. There are MCU bridges for IP and ISDN-based videoconferencing. There are MCUs which are pure software, and others which are a combination of hardware and software. An MCU is characterised according to the number of simultaneous calls it can handle, its ability to conduct transposing of data rates and protocols, and features such as Continuous Presence, in which multiple parties can be seen on-screen at once. MCUs can be stand-alone hardware devices, or they can be embedded into dedicated videoconferencing units.\n\nThe MCU consists of two logical components:\n# A single multipoint controller (MC), and\n# Multipoint Processors (MP), sometimes referred to as the mixer.\n\nThe MC controls the conferencing while it is active on the signaling plane, which is simply where the system manages conferencing creation, endpoint signaling and in-conferencing controls. This component negotiates parameters with every endpoint in the network and controls conferencing resources.\nWhile the MC controls resources and signaling negotiations, the MP operates on the media plane and receives media from each endpoint. The MP generates output streams from each endpoint and redirects the information to other endpoints in the conference.\n\nSome systems are capable of multipoint conferencing with no MCU, stand-alone, embedded or otherwise. These use a standards-based H.323 technique known as \"decentralized multipoint\", where each station in a multipoint call exchanges video and audio directly with the other stations with no central \"manager\" or other bottleneck. The advantages of this technique are that the video and audio will generally be of higher quality because they don't have to be relayed through a central point. Also, users can make ad-hoc multipoint calls without any concern for the availability or control of an MCU. This added convenience and quality comes at the expense of some increased network bandwidth, because every station must transmit to every other station directly.<ref name=\"V&VCF\" />\n\n=== Cloud-based video conferencing ===\n\nCloud-based video conferencing can be used without the hardware generally required by other video conferencing systems, and can be designed for use by [[Small and medium enterprises|SMEs]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-276065692.html |title=PDS and Vidtel Enable Affordable, Cloud-Based, Interoperable Video Conferencing for Southeast Michigan Businesses |publisher=Information Technology Newsweekly |accessdate=February 19, 2014 |date=December 27, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140611071132/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-276065692.html |archivedate=June 11, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> or larger international or multinational corporations like [[Facebook]].<ref name=Stair>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=iT4WAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA288&dq=cloud-based+video+conferencing#v=onepage&q=cloud-based%20video%20conferencing&f=false |page=288 |accessdate=February 19, 2014 |title=Principles of Information Systems |author=Ralph Stair and George Reynolds |publisher=Cengage Learning |year=2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160511201829/https://books.google.com/books?id=iT4WAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA288&dq=cloud-based+video+conferencing&hl=en&sa=X&ei=cAEFU_D2Je_wyAHsuIC4Aw&ved=0CFAQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=cloud-based%20video%20conferencing&f=false |archivedate=May 11, 2016 |isbn=978-1285414775 }}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.cio.com/article/746946/Facebook_CIO_Supports_Video_Calls_to_Preserve_Employee_Culture#undefined |date=January 30, 2014 |title=Facebook CIO Supports Video Calls to Preserve Employee Culture |author=Stacy Collett |magazine=[[CIO Magazine]] |accessdate=February 19, 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140213025348/http://www.cio.com/article/746946/Facebook_CIO_Supports_Video_Calls_to_Preserve_Employee_Culture#undefined |archivedate=February 13, 2014 }}</ref> Cloud-based systems can handle either 2D or 3D video broadcasting.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-330937061.html |accessdate=February 19, 2014 |title=\"Cloud-Based Interoperability Platform for Video Conferencing\" in Patent Application Approval Process |publisher=Politics & Government Week |date=May 23, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140611070857/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-330937061.html |archivedate=June 11, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Cloud-based systems can also implement mobile calls, VOIP, and other forms of video calling.

Consequently, personal videoconferencing systems based on a webcam, personal computer system, software compression, and broadband Internet connectivity have become progressively more affordable to the general public. Also, the hardware used for this technology has continued to improve in quality, and prices have dropped dramatically. The availability of freeware (often as part of [[chat program]]s) has made software based videoconferencing accessible to many.\n\nThe widest deployment of video telephony now occurs in [[mobile phone]]s. Nearly all mobile phones supporting [[UMTS]] networks can work as videophones using their internal cameras, and are able to make video calls wirelessly to other UMTS users in the same country or internationally.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} As of the second quarter of 2007, there are over 131 million UMTS users (and hence potential videophone users), on 134 networks in 59 countries.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} Mobile phones can also use broadband wireless Internet, whether through the cell phone network or over a local [[wifi]] connection, along with software-based videophone apps to make calls to any video-capable Internet user, whether mobile or fixed.\n\n[[Hearing impairment|Deaf, hard-of-hearing]], and [[mutism|mute]] individuals have a particular role in the development of affordable high-quality videotelephony as a means of communicating with each other in [[sign language]].

Journalists can participate on an international press conference from any location, without leaving their offices or countries. They need only be seated by a computer connected to the Internet in order to ask their questions.\n\nIn 2004, the [[International Monetary Fund]] introduced the Online Media Briefing Center, a password-protected site available only to professional journalists. The site enables the IMF to present press briefings globally and facilitates direct questions to briefers from the press. The site has been copied by other international organizations since its inception.

The United States and several other countries compensate companies to provide \"Video Relay Services\" (VRS). Telecommunication equipment can be used to talk to others via a sign language interpreter, who uses a conventional telephone at the same time to communicate with the deaf person's party. Video equipment is also used to do on-site sign language translation via [[Video Remote Interpreting]] (VRI). The relative low cost and widespread availability of [[3G]] [[mobile phone]] technology with video calling capabilities have given deaf and speech-impaired users a greater ability to communicate with the same ease as others. Some wireless operators have even started free sign language gateways.\n\nSign language interpretation services via VRS or by VRI are useful in the present day where one of the parties is [[deaf]], [[hard-of-hearing]], or [[Speech disorder|speech-impaired (mute)]]. In such cases the interpretation flow is normally within the same principal language, such as [[French Sign Language]] (LSF) to spoken French, [[Spanish Sign Language]] (LSE) to spoken Spanish, [[British Sign Language]] (BSL) to spoken English, and [[American Sign Language]] (ASL) also to spoken English (since BSL and ASL are completely distinct to each other), [[German Sign Language]] (DGS) to spoken German, and so on.\n\n[[Multilingual]] [[Interpreters#Sign language interpreting|sign language interpreter]]s, who can also translate as well across principal languages (such as a multilingual interpreter interpreting a call from a deaf person using ASL to reserve a hotel room at a hotel in the [[Dominican Republic]] whose staff speaks Spanish only, therefore the interpreter has to utilize ASL, spoken Spanish, and spoken English to facilitate the call for the deaf person), are also available, albeit less frequently. Such activities involve considerable mental processing efforts on the part of the translator, since sign languages are distinct [[natural language]]s with their own [[Linguistics|construction]], [[semantics]] and [[syntax]], different from the aural version of the same principal language.\n\nWith video interpreting, [[sign language]] interpreters work remotely with live [[video]] and [[Sound recording and reproduction|audio]] feeds, so that the interpreter can see the deaf or mute party, and converse with the hearing party, and vice versa. Much like [[telephone interpreting]], video interpreting can be used for situations in which no on-site [[Interpreters#Sign language interpreting|interpreters]] are available. However, video interpreting cannot be used for situations in which all parties are speaking via telephone alone. VRS and VRI interpretation requires all parties to have the [[List of video telecommunication services and product brands|necessary equipment]]. Some advanced equipment enables interpreters to control the video camera remotely, in order to [[Zoom lens|zoom]] in and out or to point the camera toward the party that is signing.\n\n== Descriptive names and terminology ==\n\n{{See also|List of video telecommunication services and product brands}}\n\nThe name \"videophone\" never became as standardized as its earlier counterpart \"telephone\", resulting in a variety of names and terms being used worldwide, and even within the same region or country.

[http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/Videotelephony Videotelephony], McGraw-Hill, 2002. Retrieved from the FreeDictionary.com website, January 9, 2010</ref> A '''videophone''' is a [[telephone]] with a [[Display device|video display]], capable of simultaneous video and audio for communication between people in [[Real-time computing|real time]]. '''Videoconferencing''' implies the use of this technology for a group or organizational meeting rather than for individuals, in a '''videoconference'''.<ref name=\"Mulbach-1995c\">Mulbach et al, 1995. pg. 291.</ref> [[Telepresence]] may refer either to a high-quality videotelephony system (where the goal is to create the illusion that remote participants are in the same room) or to meetup technology, which goes beyond video into robotics (such as moving around the room or physically manipulating objects). Videoconferencing has also been called \"visual collaboration\" and is a type of [[groupware]].\n\nWhile development of video conferencing started in the late 19th century, the technology only became available to the public starting in the 1930s. These early demonstrations were installed at \"booths\" in post offices and shown at various world expositions. It took until 1970 for AT&T to launch the first true video conferencing system, wherein anyone could subscribe to the service and have the technology in their home or office. Videotelephony also included \"image phones\" which would exchange still images between units every few seconds over conventional [[plain old telephone service]] (POTS) lines, essentially the same as [[Slow-scan television|slow-scan TV]]. The development of advanced [[codec|video codecs]], more powerful [[CPU]]s, and high-bandwidth [[internet Protocol|Internet telecommunication services]] in the late 1990s allowed videophones to provide high quality low-cost colour service between users almost any place in the world where the Internet is available.\n\nAlthough not as widely used in everyday communications as audio-only and text communication, useful applications include [[sign language]] transmission for [[deaf]] and [[Speech disorder|speech-impaired]] people, [[distance education]], [[telemedicine]], and overcoming [[disability|mobility issues]]. It is also used in commercial and corporate settings to facilitate meetings and conferences, typically between parties that already have established relationships. [[News media]] organizations have begun to use desktop technologies like [[Skype]] to provide higher-quality audio than the celluar phone network, and video links at much lower cost than sending professional equipment or using a professional studio. More popular videotelephony technologies use the Internet rather than the traditional landline phone network, even accounting for modern digital packetized phone network protocols, and even though videotelephony software commonly runs on [[smartphones]].\n\n== History ==\n\n{{Main|History of videotelephony}}\n[[File:France in XXI Century. Correspondance cinema.jpg|thumb|Video telephony predicted to be in use by the year 2000, as envisioned in 1910 (artist's conception)]]\n[[Image:Bell telephone magazine (1922) (14756466975).jpg|thumb|Video telephone booth, 1930]]\n\nThe concept of videotelephony was first conceived in the late 1870s both in the United States and in Europe, although the basic sciences to permit its very earliest trials would take nearly a half century to be discovered.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}} This was first embodied in the device which came to be known as the video telephone, or videophone, and it evolved from intensive research and experimentation in several telecommunication fields, notably [[electrical telegraphy]], [[telephony]], [[radio]], and [[television]].\n\nSimple analog videophone communication could be established as early as the invention of the [[television]]. Such an antecedent usually consisted of two [[closed-circuit television]] systems connected via [[Coaxial cable|coax cable]] or [[radio]]. An example of that was the German Reich Postzentralamt (post office) video telephone network serving Berlin and several German cities via coaxial cables between 1936 and 1940.<ref>\"German Postoffice To Use Television\u2013Telephone For Its Communication System\", (Associated Press) The Evening Independent, St. Petersburg, Fl, September 1, 1934</ref><ref>Peters, C. Brooks, \"Talks On 'See-Phone': Television Applied to German Telephones Enables Speakers to See Each Other{{nbsp}}...\", The New York Times, September 18, 1938</ref>\n\nThe development of video conferencing as a subscription service started in the latter half of the 1920s in the United Kingdom and the United States, spurred notably by [[John Logie Baird]] and [[Bell Labs|AT&T's Bell Labs]]. This occurred in part, at least with AT&T, to serve as an adjunct supplementing the use of the telephone. A number of organizations believed that videotelephony would be superior to plain voice communications. Attempts at using normal [[telephony]] networks to transmit slow-scan video, such as the first systems developed by [[AT&T Corporation]], first researched in the 1950s, failed mostly due to the poor picture quality and the lack of efficient video [[Video compression|compression]] techniques. \n\nThe first manned [[space flight]]s, [[NASA]] used two radio-frequency ([[UHF]] or [[VHF]]) video links, one in each direction. TV channels routinely use this type of videotelephony when reporting from distant locations. The news media were to become regular users of mobile links to [[satellite]]s using specially equipped trucks, and much later via special satellite videophones in a briefcase. This technique was very expensive, though, and could not be used for applications such as [[telemedicine]], [[distance education]], and business meetings. \n\nDecades of research and development culminated in the 1970 commercial launch of AT&T's Picturephone service, available in select cities. However, the system was a commercial failure, chiefly due to consumer apathy, high subscription costs, and lack of [[network effect]]\u2014with only a few hundred Picturephones in the world, users had extremely few contacts they could actually call, and [[interoperability]] with other videophone systems would not exist for decades. \n[[File:On Line System Videoconferencing FJCC 1968.jpg|thumb|Multiple user videoconferencing first being demonstrated with [[Stanford Research Institute]]'s [[NLS (computer system)|NLS computer technology]] (1968)]]\n\nVery expensive [[videoconferencing]] systems continued to evolve throughout the 1980s and 1990s. Proprietary equipment, software, and network requirements gave way to standards-based technologies that were available for anyone to purchase at a reasonable cost. Only in the late 20th century with the advent of powerful [[video codec]]s combined with high-speed [[Internet access|Internet broadband]] and [[Integrated Services Digital Network|ISDN]] service did videotelephony become a practical technology for regular use.\n\n=== Digital videotelephony ===\n\nPractical digital videotelephony was made possible only with advances in [[video compression]], due to the impractically high bandwidth requirements of [[uncompressed video]]. To achieve [[Video Graphics Array]] (VGA) quality video ([[480p]] resolution and [[256 colors]]) with raw uncompressed video, it would require a bandwidth of over 92{{nbsp}}[[Mbps]].<ref name=\"Belmudez\">{{cite book |last1=Belmudez |first1=Benjamin |title=Audiovisual Quality Assessment and Prediction for Videotelephony |date=2014 |publisher=Springer |isbn=9783319141664 |pages=11\u201313 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ULTzBQAAQBAJ}}</ref> The most important compression technique that enabled practical digital videotelephony and videoconferencing is the [[discrete cosine transform]] (DCT).<ref name=\"Belmudez\"/><ref name=\"Huang\">{{cite book |last1=Huang |first1=Hsiang-Cheh |last2=Fang |first2=Wai-Chi |title=Intelligent Multimedia Data Hiding: New Directions |date=2007 |publisher=Springer |isbn=9783540711698 |page=41 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=67W5BQAAQBAJ&pg=PA41}}</ref> The DCT, a form of [[lossy compression]], was conceived in 1972 by [[N.

During this time, there was also research into other forms of digital video and audio communication.

During the late 1930s the post offices of several European governments established public videophone services for person-to-person communications utilizing dual cable circuit telephone transmission technology. In the present day standalone videophones and [[UMTS]] video-enabled [[mobile phone]]s are usually used on a person-to-person basis.\n\n'''Videoconferencing''' saw its earliest use with AT&T's Picturephone service in the early 1970s. Transmissions were analog over short distances, but converted to digital forms for longer calls, again using telephone transmission technology. Popular corporate video-conferencing systems in the present day have migrated almost exclusively to digital [[ISDN]] and [[Internet Protocol|IP]] transmission modes due to the need to convey the very large amounts of data generated by their cameras and microphones. These systems are often intended for use in conference mode, that is by many people in several different locations, all of whom can be viewed by every participant at each location.\n\n[[Telepresence]] systems are a newer, more advanced subset of videoconferencing systems, meant to allow higher degrees of video and audio fidelity. Such high-end systems are typically deployed in corporate settings.\n\n[[Mobile collaboration]] systems are another recent development, combining the use of video, audio, and on-screen drawing capabilities using newest generation [[Mobile device|hand-held electronic devices]] broadcasting over secure networks, enabling multi-party conferencing in real time, independent of location.\n\nA more recent technology encompassing these functions is TV cams. TV cams enable people to make video \"phone\" calls using video calling services, like Skype on their TV, without using a PC connection. TV cams are specially designed video cameras that feed images in real time to another TV camera or other compatible computing devices like smartphones, tablets and computers.\n\n''[[Webcam]]s'' are popular, relatively low cost devices which can provide live video and audio streams via [[personal computer]]s, and can be used with many [[List of video telecommunication services and product brands#Software Client brands|software clients]] for both video calls and videoconferencing.<ref name=\"books.google.com\">Solomon Negash, Michael E.

The burden of presenting an acceptable on-screen appearance is not present in audio-only communication. Early studies by Alphonse Chapanis found that the addition of video actually impaired communication, possibly because of the consciousness of being on camera.<ref>{{cite journal| title=Studies in interactive communication II: The effects of four communication modes on the linguistic performance of teams during cooperative problem solving| last1=Chapanis| first1=A| last2=Ochsman| first2=R| last3=Parrish| first3=R| journal=Human Factors| year=1977| volume=19| issue=2| pages=101\u2013126| doi=10.1177/001872087701900201}}</ref>\n* '''Signal latency''': The information transport of digital signals in many steps need time. In a telecommunicated conversation, an increased [[latency (engineering)|latency]] (time lag) larger than about 150\u2013300 ms becomes noticeable and is soon observed as unnatural and distracting. Therefore, next to a stable large bandwidth, a small [[Internet Control Message Protocol|total round-trip time]] is another major technical requirement for the communication channel for interactive videoconferencing.<ref name=\"Percy\">Percy, Alan. [http://www.telephonyworld.com/training/brooktrout/iptel_latency_wp.html ''Understanding Latency''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514133416/http://www.telephonyworld.com/training/brooktrout/iptel_latency_wp.html |date=2013-05-14 }}</ref>\n* '''Bandwidth and quality of service''': In some countries it is difficult or expensive to get a high quality connection that is fast enough for good-quality video conferencing. Technologies such as [[ADSL]] are usually provided as two separate lines (for uplink/downlink) because each has limited upload speeds and cannot upload and download simultaneously at full speed. As Internet speeds increase higher quality and high definition video conferencing will become more readily available.\n* '''Complexity of systems''': Most users are not technical and want a simple interface. In hardware systems, an unplugged cord or a dead battery in a remote control is seen as failure, contributing to a perceived unreliability. Successful systems are backed by support teams who can pro-actively support and provide fast assistance when required.\n* '''Perceived lack of interoperability''': not all systems can readily interconnect, for example ISDN and IP systems require a gateway. Popular software solutions cannot easily connect to hardware systems. Some systems use different standards, features, and qualities which can require additional configuration when connecting to dissimilar systems. Free software systems circumvent this limitation by making it relatively easy for a single user to communicate over multiple incompatible platforms.\n* '''Expense of commercial systems''': well-designed [[telepresence]] systems require specially designed rooms which can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars to fit out their rooms with codecs, integration equipment (such as [[Multipoint Control Unit]]s), high fidelity sound systems, and furniture. Monthly charges may also be required for bridging services and high capacity broadband service.\n\nThese are some of the reasons many systems are often used for internal corporate use only, as they are less likely to result in lost sales. One alternative to companies lacking dedicated facilities is the [[List of video telecommunication services and product brands#Public videoconferencing facilities|rental of videoconferencing-equipped meeting rooms]] in cities around the world. Clients can book rooms and turn up for the meeting, with all technical aspects being prearranged and support being readily available if needed. The issue of eye-contact may be solved with advancing technology, including smartphones which have the screen and camera in essentially the same place. The ubiquity of [[smartphone]]s, [[tablet computer]]s, and computers with built-in audio and webcams in developed countries obviates the need to buy expensive hardware.\n\n== Technology ==\n\n{{more citations needed section|date=February 2013}}\n\n===Components and types===\n\n[[File:Polycom VSX 7000 with 2 video conferencing screens.JPG|thumb|'''Dual display''': An older [[Polycom VSX 7000]] system and camera used for videoconferencing, with two displays for simultaneous broadcast from separate locations]]\n[[File:Room220.jpg|thumb|Components of a [[Lifesize communications|LifeSize Communications]] Room 220 high-definition multipoint system]]\n[[File:GoogleHangoutsMeeting.jpg|thumb|A video conference meeting facilitated by [[Google Hangouts]]]]\n\nThe core technology used in a videotelephony system is digital compression of audio and video streams in real time. The hardware or [[software]] that performs compression is called a [[codec]] (coder/decoder). Compression rates of up to 1:500 can be achieved. The resulting digital stream of 1s and 0s is subdivided into labeled [[Packet (information technology)|packets]], which are then transmitted through a [[digital network]] of some kind (usually [[ISDN]] or [[Internet Protocol|IP]]).\n\nThe other components required for a videoconferencing system include:\n* '''Video input''': ([[Pan\u2013tilt\u2013zoom camera|PTZ]] / [[360-degree video|360\u00b0]] / [[Fisheye lens|Fisheye]]) [[video camera]], or [[webcam]]\n* '''Video output''': [[Computer display|computer monitor]], [[television]], or [[Video projector|projector]]\n* '''Audio input''': [[microphone]]s, CD/DVD player, cassette player, or any other source of PreAmp audio outlet.\n* '''Audio output''': usually [[loudspeaker]]s associated with the display device or telephone\n* '''Data transfer''': analog or digital telephone network, [[Local area network|LAN]], or [[Internet]]\n* '''Computer''': a data processing unit that ties together the other components, does the compressing and decompressing, and initiates and maintains the data linkage via the network.\n\nThere are basically two kinds of videoconferencing and videophone systems:\n\n# '''Dedicated systems''' have all required components packaged into a single piece of equipment, usually a console with a high quality [[remote control]]led video camera. These cameras can be controlled at a distance to pan left and right, tilt up and down, and zoom. They became known as PTZ cameras. The console contains all electrical interfaces, the control computer, and the software or hardware-based codec. Omnidirectional microphones are connected to the console, as well as a TV monitor with loudspeakers and/or a [[video projector]]. There are several types of dedicated videoconferencing devices:\n## Large group videoconferencing are built-in, large, expensive devices used for large rooms such as conference rooms and auditoriums.\n## Small group videoconferencing are either non-portable or portable, smaller, less expensive devices used for small meeting rooms.\n## Individual videoconferencing are usually portable devices, meant for single users, and have fixed cameras, microphones, and loudspeakers integrated into the console.\n# '''Desktop systems''' are add-ons (hardware boards or software codec) to normal PCs and laptops, transforming them into videoconferencing devices. A range of different cameras and microphones can be used with the codec, which contains the necessary codec and transmission interfaces. Most of the desktops systems work with the [[H.323]] standard.\n# '''WebRTC Platforms''' are video conferencing solutions that are not resident by using a software application but is available through the standard web browser. Solutions such as Adobe Connect and Cisco WebEX can be accessed by going to a URL sent by the meeting organizer and various degrees of security can be attached to the virtual \"room\". Often the user will be required to download a piece of software, called an \"Add In\" to enable the browser to access the local camera, microphone and establish a connection to the meeting. WebRTC technology doesn't require any software or Add On installation, instead a WebRTC compliant internet browser itself acts as a client to facilitate 1-to-1 and 1-to-many videoconferencing calls. Several enhanced flavours of WebRTC technology are being provided by Third Party vendors.\n\n=== Videoconferencing modes ===\n\nVideoconferencing systems use two methods to determine which video feed or feeds to display.\n\n''Continuous Presence'' simply displays all participants at the same time,<ref name=\"V&VCF\" /> usually with the exception that the viewer either does not see their own feed, or sees their own feed in miniature.\n\n''Voice-Activated Switch'' selectively chooses a feed to display at each endpoint, with the goal of showing the person who is currently speaking. This is done by choosing the feed (other than the viewer) which has the loudest audio input (perhaps with some filtering to avoid switching for very short-lived volume spikes). Often if no remote parties are currently speaking, the feed with the last speaker remains on the screen.\n\n=== Echo Cancellation ===\n\n[[echo cancellation|Acoustic echo cancellation]] (AEC) is a processing [[algorithm]] that uses the knowledge of audio output to monitor audio input and filter from it noises that echo back after some time delay. If unattended, these echoes can be re-amplified several times, leading to problems including:\n* The remote party hearing their own voice coming back at them (usually significantly delayed)\n# Strong [[reverberation]], which makes the voice channel useless\n# Howling created by feedback\n\nEcho cancellation is a processor-intensive task that usually works over a narrow range of sound delays.\n\n=== Bandwidth requirements ===\n\n[[File:Bildtelefon T-View 100.JPG|thumb|left|'''[[Deutsche Telekom]] T-View 100''' [[ISDN]]-type videophone meant for home offices and small businesses, with a lens cover which can be rotated upward for privacy]]\n{{See also|Broadband Internet access}}\n\nVideophones have historically employed a variety of transmission and reception bandwidths, which can be understood as data transmission speeds. The lower the transmission/reception bandwidth, the lower the data transfer rate, resulting in a progressively limited and poorer image quality (i.e. lower resolution and/or frame rate). Data transfer rates and live video image quality are related, but are also subject to other factors such as [[Video compression|data compression techniques]]. Some early videophones employed very low data transmission rates with a resulting poor video quality.\n\n''Broadband bandwidth'' is often called \"''high-speed''\", because it usually has a high rate of data transmission. In general, any connection of 256 kbit/s (0.256 Mbit/s) or greater is more concisely considered broadband Internet. The [[International Telecommunication Union Telecommunication Standardization Sector]] (ITU-T) recommendation [[I.113]] has defined broadband as a transmission capacity at 1.5 to 2{{nbsp}}Mbit/s. The [[Federal Communications Commission]] (United States) definition of broadband is 25 Mbit/s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/01/29/f-c-c-sharply-increases-definition-of-broadband/?_r=0 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-03-23 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906004513/http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/01/29/f-c-c-sharply-increases-definition-of-broadband/?_r=0 |archivedate=2015-09-06 }}</ref>\n\nCurrently, adequate video for some purposes becomes possible at data rates lower than the ITU-T broadband definition, with rates of 768 kbit/s and 384 kbit/s used for some video conferencing applications, and rates as low as 100 kbit/s used for videophones using [[H.264|H.264/MPEG-4 AVC]] compression protocols. The newer [[MPEG-4]] [[video compression|video]] and [[Audio data compression|audio compression]] format can deliver high-quality video at 2{{nbsp}}Mbit/s, which is at the low end of [[cable modem]] and [[Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line|ADSL]] broadband performance.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}\n\n=== Standards ===\n\n[[File:TANDBERG E20.jpg|thumb|The [[Tandberg E20]] is an example of a [[Session Initiation Protocol|SIP]]-only device. Such devices need to route calls through a Video Communication Server to be able to reach [[H.323]] systems, a process known as \"interworking\" (2009).]]\n\nThe [[International Telecommunications Union]] (ITU) has three umbrellas of standards for videoconferencing:\n* ITU [[H.320]] is known as the standard for [[public switched telephone network]]s (PSTN) or videoconferencing over integrated services digital networks. While still prevalent in Europe, [[ISDN]] was never widely adopted in the United States and Canada.{{citation needed|date= March 2011}}\n* ITU [[H.264]] [[Scalable Video Coding]] (SVC) is a compression standard that enables videoconferencing systems to achieve highly error resilient [[Internet Protocol]] (IP) video transmissions over the public Internet without quality-of-service enhanced lines.<ref>[http://www.vidyo.com/comparison_video.html SVC vs. H.264/AVC Error Resilience] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090810075550/http://www.vidyo.com/comparison_video.html |date=August 10, 2009 }}</ref> This standard has enabled wide scale deployment of high definition desktop videoconferencing and made possible new architectures,<ref>[http://www.vidyo.com/whitepaper_info.html SVC White Papers] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100104232909/http://www.vidyo.com/whitepaper_info.html |date=January 4, 2010 }}</ref> which reduces latency between the transmitting sources and receivers, resulting in more fluid communication without pauses. In addition, an attractive factor for IP videoconferencing is that it is easier to set up for use along with [[web conferencing]] and [[data collaboration]]. These combined technologies enable users to have a richer [[multimedia]] environment for live meetings, collaboration and presentations.\n* ITU [[ITU-T V-Series Recommendations|V.80]]: videoconferencing is generally compatibilized with [[H.324]] standard point-to-point videotelephony over regular (POTS) phone lines.\n\nThe [[Unified Communications Interoperability Forum]] (UCIF), a non-profit alliance between communications vendors, launched in May 2010. The organization's vision is to maximize the interoperability of UC based on existing standards. Founding members of UCIF include [[Hewlett-Packard|HP]], [[Microsoft]], [[Polycom]], [[Logitech]]/[[LifeSize|LifeSize Communications]], and [[Juniper Networks]].<ref>[http://blogs.technet.com/brettjo/archive/2010/05/19/unified-communications-interoperability-forum-ucif.aspx Unified Communications Interoperability Forum]</ref><ref>[https://www.pcworld.com/article/196640/collaboration_vendors_join_for_interoperability.html Collaboration Vendors Join for Interoperability]</ref>\n\n=== Call setup ===\n\nVideoconferencing in the late 20th century was limited to the [[H.323]] protocol (notably Cisco's [[Skinny Client Control Protocol|SCCP]] implementation was an exception), but newer videophones often use [[Session Initiation Protocol|SIP]], which is often easier to set up in home networking environments.<ref>\n\nRFC 4168, ''The Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) as a Transport for the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)'', IETF, The Internet Society (2005)\n\n</ref> It is a text-based protocol, incorporating many elements of the [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol]] (HTTP) and the [[Simple Mail Transfer Protocol]] (SMTP).<ref>\n\n {{cite book\n | author = Johnston, Alan B.\n | year = 2004\n | title = SIP: Understanding the Session Initiation Protocol, Second Edition\n | publisher = Artech House\n | isbn = 978-1-58053-168-9}}\n\n</ref> H.323 is still used, but more commonly for business videoconferencing, while SIP is more commonly used in personal consumer videophones. A number of call-setup methods based on [[instant messaging]] protocols such as [[Skype]] also now provide video.\n\nAnother protocol used by videophones is [[H.324]], which mixes call setup and video compression. Videophones that work on regular phone lines typically use H.324, but the bandwidth is limited by the modem to around 33 kbit/s, limiting the video quality and frame rate. A slightly modified version of H.324 called [[3G-324M]] defined by [[3GPP]] is also used by some cellphones that allow video calls, typically for use only in [[UMTS]] networks.<ref name=\"IMTC\">\n\nIMTC.

It applied mostly to dedicated circuit-based switched network (point-to-point) connections of moderate or high bandwidth, such as through the medium-bandwidth [[ISDN]] digital phone protocol or a fractionated high bandwidth T1 lines. Modern products based on H.320 standard usually support also H.323 standard.<ref>\n\n[http://www.eng.mu.edu/rehab/Rehab167/Mod3/teleconf/h320.htm Videoconferencing on the High End: H.320] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090516053309/http://www.eng.mu.edu/rehab/Rehab167/Mod3/teleconf/h320.htm |date=May 16, 2009 }} Retrieved on 2009-06-18.</ref>\n\nThe [[IAX2]] protocol also supports videophone calls natively, using the protocol's own capabilities to transport alternate media streams. A few hobbyists obtained the Nortel 1535 Color SIP Videophone cheaply in 2010 as surplus after [[Nortel]]'s bankruptcy and deployed the sets on the [[Asterisk (PBX)]] platform. While additional software is required to patch together multiple video feeds for conference calls or convert between dissimilar video standards, SIP calls between two identical handsets within the same PBX were relatively straightforward.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://nerdvittles.com/?p=703 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-01-19 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170608160915/http://nerdvittles.com/?p=703 |archivedate=2017-06-08 }}</ref>\n\n{{further|Video codec}}\n\n=== Conferencing layers ===\n\nThe components within a videoconferencing system can be divided up into several different layers: User Interface, Conference Control, Control or Signaling Plane, and Media Plane.\n\nVideoconferencing User Interfaces (VUI) can be either graphical or voice-responsive. Many in the industry have encountered both types of interface, and normally a graphical interface is encountered on a computer. User interfaces for conferencing have a number of different uses; they can be used for scheduling, setup, and making a videocall. Through the user interface the administrator is able to control the other three layers of the system.\n\nConference Control performs resource allocation, management, and routing. This layer along with the User Interface creates meetings (scheduled or unscheduled) or adds and removes participants from a conference.\n\nControl (Signaling) Plane contains the stacks that signal different endpoints to create a call and/or a conference. Signals can be, but aren't limited to, [[H.323]] and [[Session Initiation Protocol]] (SIP) Protocols. These signals control incoming and outgoing connections as well as session parameters.\n\nThe Media Plane controls the audio and video mixing and streaming. This layer manages Real-Time Transport Protocols, User Datagram Packets (UDP) and [[RTP Control Protocol|Real-Time Transport Control Protocol]] (RTCP). The RTP and UDP normally carry information such the payload type which is the type of codec, frame rate, video size, and many others. RTCP on the other hand acts as a quality control Protocol for detecting errors during streaming.<ref name=\"V&VCF\" />\n\n=== Multipoint videoconferencing ===\n\n{{Main|Multipoint Control Unit}}\n\nSimultaneous videoconferencing among three or more remote points is possible in a hardware-based system by means of a [[Multipoint Control Unit]] (MCU). This is a bridge that interconnects calls from several sources (in a similar way to the audio conference call). All parties call the MCU, or the MCU can also call the parties which are going to participate, in sequence. There are MCU bridges for IP and ISDN-based videoconferencing. There are MCUs which are pure software, and others which are a combination of hardware and software. An MCU is characterised according to the number of simultaneous calls it can handle, its ability to conduct transposing of data rates and protocols, and features such as Continuous Presence, in which multiple parties can be seen on-screen at once. MCUs can be stand-alone hardware devices, or they can be embedded into dedicated videoconferencing units.\n\nThe MCU consists of two logical components:\n# A single multipoint controller (MC), and\n# Multipoint Processors (MP), sometimes referred to as the mixer.\n\nThe MC controls the conferencing while it is active on the signaling plane, which is simply where the system manages conferencing creation, endpoint signaling and in-conferencing controls. This component negotiates parameters with every endpoint in the network and controls conferencing resources.\nWhile the MC controls resources and signaling negotiations, the MP operates on the media plane and receives media from each endpoint. The MP generates output streams from each endpoint and redirects the information to other endpoints in the conference.\n\nSome systems are capable of multipoint conferencing with no MCU, stand-alone, embedded or otherwise. These use a standards-based H.323 technique known as \"decentralized multipoint\", where each station in a multipoint call exchanges video and audio directly with the other stations with no central \"manager\" or other bottleneck. The advantages of this technique are that the video and audio will generally be of higher quality because they don't have to be relayed through a central point. Also, users can make ad-hoc multipoint calls without any concern for the availability or control of an MCU. This added convenience and quality comes at the expense of some increased network bandwidth, because every station must transmit to every other station directly.<ref name=\"V&VCF\" />\n\n=== Cloud-based video conferencing ===\n\nCloud-based video conferencing can be used without the hardware generally required by other video conferencing systems, and can be designed for use by [[Small and medium enterprises|SMEs]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-276065692.html |title=PDS and Vidtel Enable Affordable, Cloud-Based, Interoperable Video Conferencing for Southeast Michigan Businesses |publisher=Information Technology Newsweekly |accessdate=February 19, 2014 |date=December 27, 2011 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140611071132/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-276065692.html |archivedate=June 11, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> or larger international or multinational corporations like [[Facebook]].<ref name=Stair>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=iT4WAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA288&dq=cloud-based+video+conferencing#v=onepage&q=cloud-based%20video%20conferencing&f=false |page=288 |accessdate=February 19, 2014 |title=Principles of Information Systems |author=Ralph Stair and George Reynolds |publisher=Cengage Learning |year=2013 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160511201829/https://books.google.com/books?id=iT4WAAAAQBAJ&pg=PA288&dq=cloud-based+video+conferencing&hl=en&sa=X&ei=cAEFU_D2Je_wyAHsuIC4Aw&ved=0CFAQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&q=cloud-based%20video%20conferencing&f=false |archivedate=May 11, 2016 |isbn=978-1285414775 }}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |url=http://www.cio.com/article/746946/Facebook_CIO_Supports_Video_Calls_to_Preserve_Employee_Culture#undefined |date=January 30, 2014 |title=Facebook CIO Supports Video Calls to Preserve Employee Culture |author=Stacy Collett |magazine=[[CIO Magazine]] |accessdate=February 19, 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140213025348/http://www.cio.com/article/746946/Facebook_CIO_Supports_Video_Calls_to_Preserve_Employee_Culture#undefined |archivedate=February 13, 2014 }}</ref> Cloud-based systems can handle either 2D or 3D video broadcasting.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-330937061.html |accessdate=February 19, 2014 |title=\"Cloud-Based Interoperability Platform for Video Conferencing\" in Patent Application Approval Process |publisher=Politics & Government Week |date=May 23, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140611070857/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-330937061.html |archivedate=June 11, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Cloud-based systems can also implement mobile calls, VOIP, and other forms of video calling.

Consequently, personal videoconferencing systems based on a webcam, personal computer system, software compression, and broadband Internet connectivity have become progressively more affordable to the general public. Also, the hardware used for this technology has continued to improve in quality, and prices have dropped dramatically. The availability of freeware (often as part of [[chat program]]s) has made software based videoconferencing accessible to many.\n\nThe widest deployment of video telephony now occurs in [[mobile phone]]s. Nearly all mobile phones supporting [[UMTS]] networks can work as videophones using their internal cameras, and are able to make video calls wirelessly to other UMTS users in the same country or internationally.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} As of the second quarter of 2007, there are over 131 million UMTS users (and hence potential videophone users), on 134 networks in 59 countries.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} Mobile phones can also use broadband wireless Internet, whether through the cell phone network or over a local [[wifi]] connection, along with software-based videophone apps to make calls to any video-capable Internet user, whether mobile or fixed.\n\n[[Hearing impairment|Deaf, hard-of-hearing]], and [[mutism|mute]] individuals have a particular role in the development of affordable high-quality videotelephony as a means of communicating with each other in [[sign language]].

Journalists can participate on an international press conference from any location, without leaving their offices or countries. They need only be seated by a computer connected to the Internet in order to ask their questions.\n\nIn 2004, the [[International Monetary Fund]] introduced the Online Media Briefing Center, a password-protected site available only to professional journalists.

The United States and several other countries compensate companies to provide \"Video Relay Services\" (VRS). Telecommunication equipment can be used to talk to others via a sign language interpreter, who uses a conventional telephone at the same time to communicate with the deaf person's party. Video equipment is also used to do on-site sign language translation via [[Video Remote Interpreting]] (VRI). The relative low cost and widespread availability of [[3G]] [[mobile phone]] technology with video calling capabilities have given deaf and speech-impaired users a greater ability to communicate with the same ease as others. Some wireless operators have even started free sign language gateways.\n\nSign language interpretation services via VRS or by VRI are useful in the present day where one of the parties is [[deaf]], [[hard-of-hearing]], or [[Speech disorder|speech-impaired (mute)]]. In such cases the interpretation flow is normally within the same principal language, such as [[French Sign Language]] (LSF) to spoken French, [[Spanish Sign Language]] (LSE) to spoken Spanish, [[British Sign Language]] (BSL) to spoken English, and [[American Sign Language]] (ASL) also to spoken English (since BSL and ASL are completely distinct to each other), [[German Sign Language]] (DGS) to spoken German, and so on.\n\n[[Multilingual]] [[Interpreters#Sign language interpreting|sign language interpreter]]s, who can also translate as well across principal languages (such as a multilingual interpreter interpreting a call from a deaf person using ASL to reserve a hotel room at a hotel in the [[Dominican Republic]] whose staff speaks Spanish only, therefore the interpreter has to utilize ASL, spoken Spanish, and spoken English to facilitate the call for the deaf person), are also available, albeit less frequently. Such activities involve considerable mental processing efforts on the part of the translator, since sign languages are distinct [[natural language]]s with their own [[Linguistics|construction]], [[semantics]] and [[syntax]], different from the aural version of the same principal language.\n\nWith video interpreting, [[sign language]] interpreters work remotely with live [[video]] and [[Sound recording and reproduction|audio]] feeds, so that the interpreter can see the deaf or mute party, and converse with the hearing party, and vice versa. Much like [[telephone interpreting]], video interpreting can be used for situations in which no on-site [[Interpreters#Sign language interpreting|interpreters]] are available. However, video interpreting cannot be used for situations in which all parties are speaking via telephone alone. VRS and VRI interpretation requires all parties to have the [[List of video telecommunication services and product brands|necessary equipment]].

A ''videoconference'' (also known as a ''videoteleconference'') allows two or more locations to communicate via live, simultaneous two-way video and audio transmissions. This is often accomplished by the use of a [[multipoint control unit]] (a centralized distribution and call management system) or by a similar non-centralized multipoint capability embedded in each videoconferencing unit. Again, technology improvements have circumvented traditional definitions by allowing multiple party videoconferencing via web-based applications.<ref>\n\nLawson, Stephen.

Film director [[Stanley Kubrick]] strove for scientific accuracy, relying on interviews with scientists and engineers at [[Bell Labs]] in the United States. Dr. [[Lawrence Rabiner|Larry Rabiner]] of Bell Labs, discussing videophone research in the documentary ''2001: The Making of a Myth'', stated that in the mid- to late-1960s videophones \"...{{nbsp}}captured the imagination of the public and{{nbsp}}... of Mr. Kubrick and the people who reported to him\".

Additionally, TV programming increasingly utilized videophones to interview subjects of interest and to present live coverage by news correspondents, via the Internet or by satellite links. In the mass market media, the popular U.S. [[TV talk show]] hostess [[Oprah Winfrey]] incorporated videotelephony into her TV program on a regular basis from May 21, 2009, with an initial episode called ''Where the Skype Are You?'', as part of a marketing agreement with the Internet telecommunication company [[Skype]].<ref>\n\nPhil Wolff, [http://www.skypejournal.com/2009/05/why-oprah-skype-day-was-ineffective.html Why Oprah's Skype Day Was Ineffective: Tone And Skype], Skype Journal online, May 27, 2009.

In the course of their adventure they develop a more sympathetic relationship.\n\n==Reception==\n''[[Kirkus Reviews]]'' calls the book a \"satisfying adventure ... just what young readers would order if they had the imagination to dream it up themselves,\" and goes on to say that \"[t]hough the story lacks the intriguing psychological ambiguity of, say, [[Zilpha Keatley Snyder|Zilpha Snyder]]'s ghost stories, McKillip blends history, supernatural occurrences, and firm contemporary reality with a sure sense of drama and detail that brings all three worlds to simultaneous life.\"<ref>[https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/patricia-mckillip/the-house-on-parchment-street/ Review] in ''Kirkus Reviews'', Mar. 21, 1973.</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{Patricia A.

However, the University did not formally adopt its arms until 1975, and until then the design had sometimes been employed with reverse colors, a single crown, varying martlet designs, multiple mottos and/or a surrounding banner with the words ''Universitas Collegii McGill Monte Regio''. The current coat of arms used by the University was adopted by the Board of Governors in November 1975.\n\nIn 1956, Lord Lyon King-at-Arms of Edinburgh granted a posthumous coat of arms to James McGill. The same year, the coat of arms was also registered in the Public Register of all Arms and Bearings in Scotland.

Beneath the shield is a scroll containing the words ''Grandescunt Aucta Labore'' (\"By work all things increase and grow\"), which is the University's official motto.<ref name=Archives>{{cite web|url=http://www.archives.mcgill.ca/public/exhibits/installation/main/gallery-coarms.htm|title=The Gallery: Coat-of-Arms|publisher=McGill University Archives|accessdate=18 April 2020}}</ref> Nobbs' design was patented by the Garter King-at-Arms in [[London]], [[England]] in 1922, establishing the University's right to the arms. However, the University did not formally adopt its arms until 1975, and until then the design had sometimes been employed with reverse colors, a single crown, varying martlet designs, multiple mottos and/or a surrounding banner with the words ''Universitas Collegii McGill Monte Regio''. The current coat of arms used by the University was adopted by the Board of Governors in November 1975.\n\nIn 1956, Lord Lyon King-at-Arms of Edinburgh granted a posthumous coat of arms to James McGill. The same year, the coat of arms was also registered in the Public Register of all Arms and Bearings in Scotland. In 1992, the coat of arms was registered with the Chief Herald of Canada.<ref name=Archives /> The McGill University Secretariat governs the use of McGill's logos and branding, and has a policy to ensure their correct use.<ref name=Policy />\n[[File:McGill Athletics wordmark.png|thumb|right|McGill's official wordmark.]]\n\n===Wordmark===\nMcGill University's wordmark is the word \"McGill\" in a custom font derived from [[Garamond]].

The coat of arms in full colour would be printed in the following colours: PMS 485 for the martlets, PMS 871U for the gold book and PMS 877U for the silver crowns.<ref name=Policy /> The [[RGB]] value is R237, G27, B47 or [[Hexadecimal]] value #ed1b2f for electronic display.<ref name=VisualIdentity>{{cite web|url=https://www.mcgill.ca/visual-identity/visual-identity-guide#mcgilllogo|title=Visual System|publisher=McGill Visual Identity|accessdate=18 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n==MacDonald Campus coat of arms==\n[[File:McGillMacDonaldArms.png|thumb|The Macdonald Campus coat of arms.]]\nMcGill University's second campus, the [[Macdonald Campus]] has its own coat of arms, partly derived from the arms of [[William Christopher Macdonald|Sir William Macdonald]], who founded the campus, and also borrowing from McGill as a whole's coat of arms. The Macdonald Campus insignia comprises a shield with a scroll beneath it, like the University's coat of arms. The lower section of the shield contains a red arm holding a cross with two martlets on either side on top of a gold background, while the upper section contains an open book with the University's motto in between two gold clover leaves, all on a green background. The martlets and book are borrowed from the University's coat of arms, while the arm and cross are derived from the second quarter of Macdonald's arms. The clover leaves represent fertility and their three segments represent the three purposes of the campus, agriculture, food and service.<ref name=Macdonald>{{cite web|url=http://montrealflags.tripod.com/mcgill.html|title=MacDonald Campus Coat of Arms - Flags, Coats of Arms & Symbols from the Island of Montreal|publisher=Canadiana Vexillology & Heraldry Weblinks - Ben Koorengevel|accessdate=18 April 2020}}</ref> Underneath the shield is a scroll containing the words ''Mastery for Service''.\n\nThe MacDonald Campus coat of arms were originally designed in 1939 by Dr. W. Whitehead, and were subsequently redesigned in October 1978 by Dr. R.B. Buckland with assistance from J.
