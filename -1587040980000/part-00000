It was envisioned by [[Satish Ranjan Das]], a [[Kolkata]] lawyer, who prevised a school modelled on the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[public school (United Kingdom)|public school]], but conscious of Indian ambitions and desires. Although he died in 1928, he is considered the founder of the school. The school's first [[Head teacher|headmaster]] was [[Arthur Foot|Arthur E.

Every year in January and April, the school admits pupils aged 13 in Grade 7 (known as D-form) and aged 14 in Grade 8 (C-form) respectively. Boys take the [[IGCSE]] exam in Grade 10, and for the final two years can choose between [[Indian School Certificate]] or [[International Baccalaureate]] curriculum.

Every year in January and April, the school admits pupils aged 13 in Grade 7 (known as D-form) and aged 14 in Grade 8 (C-form) respectively. Boys take the [[IGCSE]] exam in Grade 10, and for the final two years can choose between [[Indian School Certificate]] or [[International Baccalaureate]] curriculum.
