Alcohol also appears to increase [[Metabolism|metabolic rate]] significantly, thus causing more calories to be burned rather than stored in the body as [[fat]] (Klesges ''et al.'', 1994). Other research has found consumption of [[sugar]] to decrease as consumption of alcohol increases.{{Citation needed|date=April 2007}}\n\nAccording to Dr. Kent Bunting, the research results do not necessarily mean that people who wish to lose weight should continue to consume alcohol because consumption is known to have an enhancing effect on appetite. Due to these discrepancies in findings, the relationship between alcohol and weight remains unresolved and requires further research.\n\nBiological and environmental factors are thought to contribute to alcoholism and obesity.<ref name=\"Alcohol Studies 2003\">UNC Bowles Center for Alcohol Studies. Alcoholism and Obesity: Overlapping Brain Pathways? Center Line. Vol 14, 2003.</ref> The physiologic commonalities between excessive eating and excessive alcohol drinking shed light on intervention strategies, such as pharmaceutical compounds that may help those who suffer from both.\nSome of the brain signaling proteins that mediate excessive eating and weight gain also mediate uncontrolled alcohol consumption.<ref name=\"Alcohol Studies 2003\"/> Some physiological substrates that underlie food intake and alcohol intake have been identified. Melanocortins, a group of signaling proteins, are found to be involved in both excessive food intake and alcohol intake.<ref>{{cite journal | author = Thiele  | display-authors = etal | year = 2004 | title = Overlapping Peptide Control of Alcohol Self-Administration and Feeding | url = | journal = Alcohol Clin Exp Res | volume = 28 | issue = 2| pages = 288\u2013294 | doi = 10.1097/01.alc.0000113777.87190.9c }}</ref>\n\nAlcohol may contribute to obesity.
