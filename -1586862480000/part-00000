The region saw many battles between the [[Continental Army]] and the Iroquois, and several treaties drawn up after the war ceded much of the land to settlers of European descent. It is largely rural with rugged terrain.\n\nUpstate New York was transformed by the opening of the [[Erie Canal]] in 1825, which greatly eased the movement of goods from the upper midwest, the cities along the [[Great Lakes]], and Upstate New York, to the port of New York City. As a result, Upstate became a hotbed for manufacturing, giving birth to such firms as [[General Electric]], [[IBM]], [[Kodak]], and [[Xerox]], and it welcomed a large influx of immigrants. Since the mid-20th century, American de-industrialization has contributed to economic and [[population decline]] Upstate,<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=OqjqvB4fDg4C&pg=PA115&dq=factors+decline+US+steel+industry&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwjbsKCt5fzJAhXCKyYKHb0WA5YQ6AEIJTAA#v=onepage&q&f=false Technology and Steel Industry Competitiveness: Chapter 4.

As a result, Upstate also supports a strong agricultural industry, and is notable for its milk and other [[dairy|dairy products]], its fruit production (especially [[apple]]s), and [[winemaking]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.osc.state.ny.us/reports/other/agriculture21-2010.pdf |format=PDF |title=The Role of Agriculture in the New York State Economy |website=Osc.state.ny.us |access-date=October 23, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170217075828/http://osc.state.ny.us/reports/other/agriculture21-2010.pdf |archive-date=February 17, 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Significant [[hydroelectric power]] is generated by plants on the [[Genesee River|Genesee]] and [[Niagara River]]s. The [[Catskill Mountains|Catskills]] supply New York City's water.  The region is home to several popular tourist and recreational destinations, including [[Niagara Falls]], the [[Adirondack Mountains|Adirondack]] and [[Catskill Mountains]], and the [[Finger Lakes]], the latter created by retreating [[glacier]]s.\n\nBecause of its geography, rivers have played a very important role in Upstate New York's history. All the above cities are on navigable or formerly navigable rivers or lakes. Until railroads arrived around 1850, New York ran on rivers: the [[Hudson River|Hudson]], its tributary the [[Mohawk River|Mohawk]], and to a lesser extent the [[Susquehanna River|Susquehanna]] and its tributary the [[Chemung River|Chemung]]. There was regular [[steamboat]] service along the Hudson River between New York City and Albany beginning in 1807, the first such regular service in the world. There was regular commercial and passenger transportation along the Mohawk in small boats until the Erie Canal opened. Utica, which is about as far as you can go on the Mohawk, was in the early nineteenth century a busy port and the economic capital of western New York. The Erie Canal was the biggest and most expensive engineering project in the world up to that date, and even if upstream speed was at first that of a mule, its economic importance was immense, and it transformed the state of New York.\n\n==Definition==\n[[File:Map of New York Highlighting New York City.svg|thumb|right|New York City is highlighted in red; \"Upstate\" refers to some or all of the area north and west of the city.]]\n[[File:Bear Mtn Bridge.jpg|thumb|The [[Bear Mountain Bridge]] across the [[Hudson River]], as seen from [[Bear Mountain (Hudson Highlands)|Bear Mountain]].

Most of New York State is characterized both by agricultural and forested rural communities, and by small and medium-sized cities and their surrounding suburbs located along major transportation corridors.  The state's major metropolitan areas outside of New York City are Buffalo, Rochester, Albany-Schenectady-Troy, and Syracuse, each of whose population exceeds 500,000.\n\nThe different regions of New York State are influenced by and have affinities with other adjacent regions.  Western New York has cultural and economic ties to the other [[Great Lakes region (North America)|Great Lakes states]] as well as [[Southern Ontario]].  The [[Capital District, New York|Capital District]], the Hudson Valley, the [[Mohawk Valley]] and the [[Plattsburgh (city), New York|Plattsburgh]] area have ties to [[New England]]. The North Country, the extreme northern portion of the state, also has strong cultural, economic, linguistic and familial ties to [[Quebec]] and [[Eastern Ontario]].  Thus, Plattsburgh has close ties to its neighbors in the Montreal area as well as Vermont.  Much of New York State receives television and radio broadcasts from Canada and there are often other cross-border ties, both historical and familial.  A similar relationship can be seen in Northern [[New England]].\n\nLinguistically, upstate New York from Western New York east to [[Utica, New York|Utica]] is part of the [[Inland Northern American English|Inland North]] region of American English dialectology, a region which includes Midwestern cities as far west as [[Chicago]] and [[Milwaukee]]. The Hudson and lower Mohawk Valley has more in common dialectologically with western New England and New York City.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ling.upenn.edu/~dinkin/GapHandout.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=October 5, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070925234304/http://www.ling.upenn.edu/~dinkin/GapHandout.pdf |archivedate=September 25, 2007 }}</ref>  The boundary between the use of the words ''pop'' and ''soda'' to refer to soft drinks, however, falls farther west than the edge of the Inland North, running just to around the city of Rochester: Buffalo and areas west of Rochester use ''pop'', like the rest of the Inland North to the west, whereas areas east of Rochester, like Syracuse and Binghamton, use ''soda'', like New England and New York City. In Ithaca and Elmira, the border is less clear, with some people having grown up with ''pop'' and some with ''soda''; however, current trends see Ithaca, at least, turning to mostly \"soda.\"\n\n[[File:Swami opening.jpg|thumb|Opening ceremony at [[Woodstock Festival|Woodstock]]]]\n\n[[Foodways]] indigenous to regions of Upstate New York include:\n* [[Buffalo wings]] and [[beef on weck sandwich]] (Buffalo)\n*the [[Robert C.

In 1969 the [[Woodstock Festival]] was held in [[Bethel, New York]], while in 1973 another [[Summer Jam at Watkins Glen|multiday festival]] was held at the [[Watkins Glen International Raceway]].\n\nSome literary, documentary and cinematic depictions of upstate present a sense of small town, simple lifestyles, such as ''[[It's a Wonderful Life]]'', set in a small upstate town (probably based on [[Seneca Falls, New York|Seneca Falls]]) in the 1940s.\n\n==Demographics==\n[[File:Census-2000-Data-Top-US-Ancestries-by-County.svg|thumb|right|Ancestries from across the United States]] \nThe population of New York State is 19,746,227, with 11,323,961 living in either New York City or Long Island,{{when|date=January 2019}} leaving 8,422,266 for the entire rest of the state.

Italian Americans are the largest ethnic group in [[Oneida County, New York|Oneida County]], [[Schenectady County, New York|Schenectady County]], as well as in some counties in the [[Hudson Valley]] that are closest to [[New York City]]. Irish Americans represent the largest ethnic group from the Capital District, Syracuse, Binghamton, and the rest of the Hudson Valley, though they also have large Italian American populations; Irish population is consistently above 15% in most of upstate New York (reaching over 20% in the upper Hudson Valley), compared to less than 8% in most of New York City.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.syracuse.com/news/index.ssf/2015/03/which_county_is_the_most_irish_in_new_york_state_list.html|title=Which county is the most Irish in New York state?

[[African Americans]], while not as numerous as in New York City, make up at least 25% of the residents in cities such as Buffalo, Rochester, Syracuse, and Albany.\n\nThere is also a significant presence of the indigenous [[Iroquois|Haudenosaunee]] or Six Nations in the region, who retain several reservations: the [[Seneca nation]] and [[Tonawanda Band of Seneca Indians]] in Western New York, the [[Onondaga nation]] south of Syracuse, the [[Oneida nation]] of Oneida County and the [[Mohawk nation]] in [[Franklin County, New York|Franklin County]]. Members of the Six Nations also live in the cities of Upstate New York.\n\n== Geography ==\n[[File:Whiteface Mountain from Lake Placid Airport.JPG|thumb|[[Whiteface Mountain]], in the [[Adirondack Mountains|Adirondacks]]]]\nThe headwaters of the [[Delaware River|Delaware]], [[Susquehanna River|Susquehanna]], Hudson, and [[Allegheny River|Allegheny]] rivers are located in the region. The region is characterized by the major mountain ranges, large lakes, and extensive forests.\n\n[[File:Canisteo valley 1453.JPG|left|thumb|Canisteo River Valley in the [[Allegheny Plateau]]]]\nThe [[Allegheny Plateau]] extends into west and central New York from the south. The Catskill Mountains lie in the southeastern part of the state, closer to New York City. The Catskills and the Allegheny Plateau are both part of the [[Appalachian Mountains]]. The northernmost part of the state contains the Adirondack Mountains, which are sometimes considered part of the Appalachians but are geologically separate, a southern extension of the [[Canadian Shield]].\n\nIn the more mountainous eastern part of Upstate New York, the valleys of the Hudson River and the [[Mohawk River]] were historically important travel corridors and remain so today. Western New York in the vicinity of Buffalo is very flat, as it was once the bottom of a glacial lake. The only \"hills\" in [[Niagara County, New York|Niagara County]] are the [[Niagara Escarpment]], which formed the [[Niagara Falls|Falls]].\n\nUpstate has a long shared border with Canadian province of [[Ontario]] divided by water; including the [[Lake Erie]], [[Niagara River]], [[Lake Ontario]] and the St. Lawrence River. It shares a land border with the province of [[Quebec]] in the northernmost part of the state.\n\nThe sizes of upstate counties and towns are generally larger in area and smaller in population, compared with the downstate region, although there are exceptions. The state's smallest county in population ([[Hamilton County, New York|Hamilton County]]) and largest county in area ([[St. Lawrence County, New York|St. Lawrence County]] on the state's northern border) are both in Upstate New York, while the largest in population ([[Kings County, New York|Kings County]]) and smallest in area ([[Manhattan|New York County]]) are both part of New York City.\n\n===Climate===\n[[File:NYlakeeffectsnow.png|thumb|left|upright=1.15|Average seasonal snowfall totals for areas subject to lake-effect snow in New York (in inches).<ref name=NWS_snowseason>{{cite web|title=Average Seasonal Snowfall Over the Eastern Great Lakes Region |url=http://www.erh.noaa.gov/er/buf/lakeffect/snowseason.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131210074031/http://www.erh.noaa.gov/er/buf/lakeffect/snowseason.html |archivedate=December 10, 2013 |url-status=dead |website=Erh.noaa.gov |author=NOAA's National Weather Service |accessdate=January 31, 2015}}</ref>]]Upstate New York is well known for its cold and snowy winters, particularly in comparison to the more temperate climate of downstate New York.

The conflict between the two peoples continued through the period of early European colonization, and the French, Dutch and English tended to ally with their trading partners among the indigenous peoples. The Haudenosaunee or [[Iroquois confederacy]] of the Five (later Six) Nations was a powerful force in its home territory. The Five Nations' territory extended from the Mohawk River Valley through the western part of the state and into current Pennsylvania. From this home base they also controlled at various times large swaths of additional territory throughout what is now the northeastern United States. The [[Guswhenta (Two Row Wampum Treaty)]], made with the Dutch government in 1613, codified relations between the Haudenosaunee and European colonizers, and formed the basis of subsequent treaties. In the mid-17th century, during the [[Beaver Wars]], the Iroquois were victorious and dominated the tribes of [[Neutral Nation|Neutral Indians]], [[Wenrohronon]] and the [[Erie (tribe)|Erie Indians]] in Western New York. (Survivors were mostly assimilated into the [[Seneca people]] of the Iroquois; some are believed to have escaped to South Carolina, where they merged with other Indian tribes.)\n\nThe region was important from the first days of both [[France|French]] and [[Netherlands|Dutch]] colonization In the seventeenth century.  The [[New Netherland]] colony encompassed the Hudson Valley from Manhattan island north to the confluence of the Hudson and Mohawk rivers, where [[Fort Orange]] (later Albany) was established in 1623. The fort at [[Schenectady, New York]] was built in 1661.  The upper Hudson Valley was the center of much of the colony's [[fur trade]], which was highly lucrative, serving a demand for furs in Europe.\n\nNorth and west of New Netherland, the French established trading posts along the St. Lawrence River and as far south as the shores of [[Onondaga Lake]]. They found both trading and proselytizing difficult among the Haudenosaunee, as [[Samuel de Champlain]] had alienated the Haudenosaunee during military forays from [[New France]].  In the 1640s, three [[Jesuit missions in North America#Missions|French Jesuit missionaries]] to New France \u2014St. [[Ren\u00e9 Goupil]], St. [[Isaac Jogues]], and St. [[Jean de Lalande]]\u2014were killed near the Mohawk village of Ossernenon, which was located at the confluence of the Schoharie and Mohawk rivers, where the modern town of [[Auriesville, New York|Auriesville]] was later developed. They are considered to be the first three [[List of American saints and beatified people|U.S. saints]].\n\nEngland seized New Netherland by force in 1664, renaming it New York.  The Dutch recaptured the colony nine years later, but ceded it to England under the [[Treaty of Westminster (1674)|Treaty of Westminster]] of 1674.\n\nIn the eighteenth century, the British consolidated their hold on the region.  [[Sir William Johnson, 1st Baronet|William Johnson]], a Scottish trader, established an estate in the Mohawk Valley, living among the Mohawk, learning their language, and forging an alliance with them. He was appointed as the British Indian agent to the Iroquois. The British also encouraged settlement in the Mohawk Valley by other Europeans, including [[German Palatines]] beginning in the 1720s.\n\nIn what became known as the [[Albany Congress]] in 1754, delegates from seven of the thirteen British North American colonies met at Albany to pursue a treaty with the powerful Mohawk. [[Benjamin Franklin]], a Pennsylvania delegate, proposed a plan for uniting the seven colonies that greatly exceeded the scope of the congress. The delegates spent most of their time debating this [[Albany Plan]] of union, one of the first attempts to form a union of the [[Thirteen Colonies|colonies]] \"under one government as far as might be necessary for defense and other general important purposes\".<ref>''The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin'', Second Edition.  Yale University Press, 1964. pp.209-210</ref>  The delegates approved an amended version, but the colonies rejected it.\n\nTo counter the French militarily, the British established forts along Lake Ontario and at portages between the Mohawk Valley and the adjacent Lake Champlain and Lake Ontario watersheds. The region became the area for many conflicts of the [[French and Indian War]], such as the [[Battle of Fort Oswego (1756)]] and the [[Siege of Fort William Henry]] (which was later depicted in the work of [[James Fenimore Cooper]]), during the [[Seven Years' War]].\n\nThe British conquered New France by 1760 with the fall of Quebec.  France formally ceded New France to the British in the [[Treaty of Paris of 1763]].  The same year, [[King George III]] issued the [[Royal Proclamation of 1763]], which established the western and northern boundary of the Province of New York at the limits of the Hudson, Mohawk and Delaware River watersheds.  The area between that boundary and the Great Lakes and Saint Lawrence River, including west of the Appalachian Mountains, was to be the \"[[Indian Reserve (1763)|Indian Reserve]].\"\n\n===American Revolution===\n\n[[File:Incident in cherry valley.jpg|thumb|[[Cherry Valley massacre]]]]\nBetween 1774 and 1783, deeply divided colonists waged civil war on each other directly and by proxy, through attacks such as the Seneca-led [[Cherry Valley massacre|Cherry Valley]] and the Mohawk-led [[Battle of Cobleskill|Cobleskill]] massacre.  In 1779, the [[Sullivan Expedition]], a campaign by the Continental Army ordered by General [[George Washington]], drove thousands of the Haudenosaunee from their villages, farms and lands in the region in an effort to both avenge and prevent such attacks.\n\nThe region was strategically important to the war plans of both the British and the Continental forces.  British efforts to divide the New England colonies from the rest led to battles including the [[Battle of Valcour Island]] and the [[Battle of Saratoga]], a significant turning point in the war.  While New York City remained in the hands of the British during most of the war, the upstate region was eventually dominated by the Colonial forces.  At the end of the war, the Continental Army was headquartered in Newburgh.  Uncertain that the Continental Congress would pay back wages, some Continental officers threatened an uprising in what became known as the [[Newburgh Conspiracy]].\n\n===Post-revolutionary period===\nAfter the American Revolution, the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] established the border between New York and [[British North America]]. The 45th Parallel became the border with Quebec or [[Lower Canada]].  The St. Lawrence River, Lake Ontario, the Niagara River and Lake Erie became the border with [[Upper Canada]].  Great Britain continued to occupy military installations along the American shores of the Great Lakes until 1794, including Fort Niagara at the mouth of the Niagara River and Fort Ontario at the mouth of the Oswego River.\n\nThe government of the new State of New York seized the property of New Yorkers who had remained loyal to the British crown.  Thousands emigrated to colonies that remained under British rule, such as Nova Scotia and the newly established Upper Canada (now [[Ontario]]).  Haudenosaunee who had fought with the British also fled.  The British Crown granted a large tract of land in Upper Canada to their Haudenosaunee allies, who established the [[Six Nations of the Grand River First Nation|Grand River]] settlement.\n\nIn the federal [[Treaty of Canandaigua]], the new United States recognized the title of the remaining Haudenosaunee to the land north and west of the Proclamation Line of 1763. Nevertheless, New York state officials and private land agents sought through the early 19th century to extinguish Indian title to these lands via non-Federally-sanctioned treaties, such as the [[Treaty of Big Tree]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oswego.edu/library2/archives/digitized_collections/granger/bigtree.html |title=Iroquois Bio |website=Oswego.edu |date= |accessdate=October 23, 2016}}</ref> The [[Treaties of Buffalo Creek]] were designed to finally remove the last of the native claims in Western New York as part of the federal [[Indian Removal]] program, but the purchaser failed to buy most of the land in time, and some of the tribes objected to their exclusion. Three of the four reservations remain in the region to this day; one of the reservations leased out their land to form the city of [[Salamanca (city), New York|Salamanca]], and the coexistence of the predominantly white city and the reservation has been a source of contention since the 1990s.\n\nBoth before and after the Revolution, boundary disputes with other colonies and their successor states also complicated American settlement. In conflict with [[New York Colony]]'s claims west of the Hudson Valley, which placed the entire region in the sprawling [[Albany County, New York|Albany County]], [[Pennsylvania Colony]] claimed much of the [[Southern Tier]] until 1774, while [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] claimed all of the region west of Massachusetts to the Great Lakes.\n\nThe Province of New York also claimed jurisdiction east to the Connecticut River.  To pursue this claim north of Connecticut and Massachusetts, New York granted lands to settlers in what is now Vermont at the same time that New Hampshire made grants of the same lands. When Vermont declared independence in 1777, the new Republic of Vermont recognized the New Hampshire grants over those of New York. New Yorkers who lost land in Vermont came to be known as the \"Vermont Sufferers\" and were granted new lands in 1788 in the Town of [[Bainbridge (town), New York|Bainbridge, New York]].\n\nThe dispute with Massachusetts over lands to the west of Massachusetts was settled in the 1786 [[Treaty of Hartford (1786)|Treaty of Hartford]] by dividing the rights to the land. The treaty granted sovereignty to the State of New York, but granted to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts the \"pre-emptive\" right to seek title to the land from the Haudenosaunee. The eastern boundary of the Massachusetts lands was thus known as the [[Preemption Line]]. This line runs from the Pennsylvania line due north to Lake Ontario, passing through Seneca Lake. The line was surveyed a second time due to initial errors.  The Commonwealth of Massachusetts sold this land in large tracts, including the [[Phelps and Gorham Purchase]] and the [[Holland Purchase]].\n\nMany of the settlers of what then became Central and Western New York came from the New England states. The [[Central New York Military Tract]], where many of the townships were given the names of classical military and literary figures by [[Robert Harpur]], was established to grant land to Revolutionary War veterans. Some of Northern New York was founded by the hundreds of Canadian exiles who had fought in the [[1st Canadian Regiment|First]] and [[2nd Canadian Regiment|Second Canadian Regiments]] of the [[Continental Army]], who were banished from Canada due to their rebellion against the Crown.\n\n===19th century===\n[[File:Battleofpburg.jpg|thumb|1816 engraving of the [[Battle of Plattsburgh]]]]\nBattles of the [[War of 1812]] (1812&ndash;1815) were fought on the [[Niagara Frontier]], in the [[Champlain Valley]], including the [[Battle of Plattsburgh]], in the [[St. Lawrence Valley]], and on [[Lake Ontario]], including the Battle of [[Sackets Harbor]].

Subsequently, it was discovered that at that point, the actual 45th parallel was three-quarters of a mile south of the surveyed line, putting the Fort, which became known as \"Fort Blunder\", in Canada. This was not resolved until 1842 with the [[Webster-Ashburton Treaty]], in which Great Britain and the United States decided to leave the border on the meandering line as surveyed.\n\n[[History of slavery in New York|Slavery]] existed in [[New Netherland]] and the [[Province of New York]]. New York was in the 1690s the largest importer of slaves among the American colonies. Slavery did not end with the [[American Revolution]], although [[John Jay]] introduced an emancipation bill into the State Assembly as early as 1777. [[Sojourner Truth]] was held as a slave in the [[Hudson Valley]] from the time she was born in 1797 until she escaped in 1826. Through efforts of the [[New York Manumission Society]] and others, New York began to adopt a policy of gradual emancipation in 1799. The law passed in 1817 that would finally emancipate slaves did not take effect for ten years, giving slaveowners an entire decade to sell their slaves away to other states. When the law finally took effect, the last 2,800 slaves in New York State were emancipated on July 4, 1827.\n\n[[File:Lockport bartlett color crop.jpg|left|thumb|[[Erie Canal]] at [[Lockport, New York]], in 1839]]\nAlthough routes for travel on foot and by canoe had existed across the region for hundreds of years, transportation of agricultural goods to market was expensive and slow.  Influenced by the canals being built in Britain, leading citizens of New York began to press for the construction of a canal across the state.  Governor [[DeWitt Clinton]] prevailed upon the legislature to charter and fund construction of a canal from Albany to Buffalo. Construction of the [[Erie Canal]] began in 1817 and was completed in 1825.  The canal allowed the area to become an important component of the 19th century industrial expansion in the United States. The canal also promoted trade with [[British North America]] and settlement of newer states in western territories. Later in the century the [[New York Central Railroad]] followed the \"water-level route\" from New York City to the Great Lakes, contributing to the industrialization of cities along its route.\n\nSeveral times in the nineteenth century, Upstate New York served as a staging area and refuge for Canadian rebels against Great Britain, as well as Irish-American invaders of Canada, straining British-American relations. In 1837 and 1838, in the aftermath of the [[Lower Canada Rebellion]], some [[French-speaking Quebecer|Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois]] rebels escaped south to the North Country, while on the [[Niagara Frontier]], events of the [[Upper Canada Rebellion]], also known as the [[Patriot War]], took place. In the late 1860s, some of the [[Fenian Raids]] were launched across the Niagara Frontier; [[Fenians]] also assembled in [[Malone (village), New York|Malone]].\n\nAlthough now largely discredited, the report of the 1905\u201307 [[Mills Commission]], charged with investigating the [[origins of baseball]], named [[Cooperstown]] as the place where [[baseball]] was invented in the 1830s or 1840s by [[Abner Doubleday]]. Cooperstown is the home of the [[National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum]]. (Modern research suggests that the game was actually developed in its modern form in New York City.)\n\nIn the pre-Civil War era, Upstate New York became a major center of radical [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] activity and was an important nexus of the [[Underground Railroad]]. Resistance to the [[Fugitive Slave Act]] was particularly heated in the region, as evidenced by such events as the [[Jerry Rescue]]. The American [[women's rights]] movement was also born in Upstate New York at this time. The [[Seneca Falls Convention]], the first women's rights convention, was held at [[Seneca Falls (village), New York|Seneca Falls]] in 1848.  The [[Rochester Women's Rights Convention of 1848|Rochester Convention]], the second such convention, was held two weeks later in [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]].\n\nThrough the nineteenth century, Upstate New York was a hotbed of religious revivalism. A number of sects, such as the [[Shakers]] and the [[Oneida Community]], established themselves in Upstate New York during that time. This led evangelist [[Charles Grandison Finney]] to coin the term the \"[[Burned-Over District]]\" for the region. Because of the comparative isolation of the region, many of the sects were non-conformist, and because of their non-traditional tenets they had numerous difficulties with government and other local people. The region is considered to be the cradle of [[Mormonism]], as well as the [[Women's Suffrage]] movement. The [[Mormon]]s, [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventists]] and [[Spiritualism (religious movement)|Spiritualists]] are the only 21st century survivors of the hundreds of sects created during this time; some more mainstream churches, such as the [[Wesleyan Church]] and [[Free Methodist Church]] (both offshoots of Methodism that originated in political disputes with the mainline [[Methodist Episcopal Church|Methodist church]]), also survive.\n\nIn the 19th century, extractive industries changed the landscape.  [[Potash]] was manufactured as the land was cleared for farming. [[Logging]] was rampant in the Adirondacks. [[Iron]] was mined in the Adirondacks and the North Country. By the 1870s, business leaders, concerned about the effect of deforestation on the water supply necessary to the Erie Canal, advocated for the creation of forest preserves in the Adirondacks and the Catskills. The [[Adirondack Park]] and [[Catskill Park]] were created and strengthened by a series of legislation between 1885 and 1894, when the \"[[Forever wild]]\" provision of the [[New York State Constitution]] was added.\n\n===20th century===\n[[File:Harvard Mark I.jpg|thumb|[[Harvard Mark I]], one of the earliest [[computer]]s, made by [[IBM]] in [[Endicott, New York|Endicott]]]]\nDuring the era immediately following World War II, Upstate reached what was probably its peak influence in the national economy. Major local corporations such as [[IBM]], [[General Electric]], [[Kodak]], [[Xerox]] and [[Carrier Corporation|Carrier]] had national success,  producing cutting-edge products for business, government and consumers, and leadership in corporate culture. The opening of the [[New York State Thruway]] in the mid-1950s gave the region superior access to other eastern markets. This regional advantage faded as many local firms relocated certain operations to other states, or downsized in the face of foreign competition, similar to events in other areas in the American [[Rust Belt]].\n\nSince the late 20th century, with the decline of manufacturing and its jobs, the area has generally suffered a net population loss, most heavily in Western New York.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} By contrast, many [[Amish]] and [[Mennonite]] families are recent arrivals to the area and have helped revive agriculture as part of the economy. Beginning in 1974, many Mennonite families moved to the [[Penn Yan]] area of [[Yates County, New York|Yates County]] from [[Lancaster County, Pennsylvania]], seeking cheaper farmland.  Amish communities have also been established in St. Lawrence, [[Montgomery County, New York|Montgomery]], [[Chautauqua County, New York|Chautauqua]] and [[Cattaraugus County, New York|Cattaraugus]] counties, and are making farming profitable.\n\nArtisans are reviving traditional specialty cheeses, and developing growing markets for their products, including shipping some items to the New York metropolitan market. A Greek-style yogurt, [[Chobani]], is being produced Upstate by a recent immigrant, who has expanded his operation nationally.\n\nAdditionally, Upstate New York continues to boast low crime rates, high educational prospects, and readily affordable daily essentials, earning Syracuse, Rochester, Albany, [[Schenectady, New York|Schenectady]], and Buffalo spots in the ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine list of top ten places to raise a family in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/2010/06/04/best-places-family-lifestyle-real-estate-cities-kids.html|title=America's Best Places To Raise A Family|first=Francesca|last=Levy|date=June 7, 2010|website=Forbes.com|accessdate=October 23, 2016}}</ref>\n\nFive of the six Iroquois nations have filed land claims against New York State (or have sought settlement of pending claims), based on late 18th-century treaties following the [[American Revolutionary War]] with the [[State of New York]] (which did not have constitutional authority to treat with American Indian nations) and the United States.\n\n==Economy==\n{{Expand section|date=October 2015}}\n{{main|Innovation and business in Upstate New York}}\n\n==Politics==\n{{main|Politics of Upstate New York}}\nOften attributed to the region's semi-rural to rural character, there is more [[Conservatism in the United States|conservatism]] in culture and politics than found in the more urban downstate area, and the region is the power base of the state's [[New York Republican State Committee|Republican Party]]. Upstate New York does however have several [[New York State Democratic Committee|Democratic]]-dominated counties, including [[Erie County, New York|Erie County]] (Buffalo), [[Monroe County, New York|Monroe County]] (Rochester), [[Onondaga County, New York|Onondaga County]] (Syracuse), [[Tompkins County, New York|Tompkins County]] (Ithaca), and [[Albany County, New York|Albany County]] (Albany).\n\nAs a whole, Upstate New York is roughly equally divided in federal elections between Democrats and Republicans. In [[U.S. presidential election, 2004, in New York|2004]], [[John Kerry]] defeated [[George W. Bush]] by fewer than 1,500 votes (1,553,246 votes to 1,551,971) in the Upstate Region.\n\n=== Relationship with New York City ===\n{{see also|Secession in New York#Upstate secession|label 1=Upstate secession}}\nNew York City is dependent on upstate for a variety of services; the latter is the source of the city's water supply via the [[Delaware Aqueduct]] and the [[Catskill Aqueduct]]; much of the city's electric power supply comes from state owned [[Niagara Falls hydroelectric generating plants|hydroelectric plants at Niagara Falls]] and the [[St. Lawrence River]]; and most of the state's prisons are upstate; hence the popular term \"being sent up the river\" (however, the term originally referred to [[Sing Sing]], which is \"up the Hudson River\" from New York City, but being in [[Ossining (town), New York|Ossining]] in [[Westchester County]] is still in the \"downstate\" region). Conversely, the operation of state facilities providing these services is an important part of the upstate economy.\n\n== Historic events ==\n<!--Keep in chronological order-->\n*[[Battle of Valcour Island]], 1776\n*[[Battle of Oriskany]], 1777\n*[[Battles of Saratoga]], turning point of the [[American Revolutionary War]], 1777\n*[[Cherry Valley massacre]], 1778\n*[[Sullivan Campaign]], 1779\n*[[Second Great Awakening]] in the [[burned-over district]], early 1800s\n*[[William Morgan (anti-Mason)|The Morgan Affair]], 1826\n*Publication of the [[Book of Mormon]], 1830\n*[[Seneca Falls Convention]], the first [[women's rights]] convention held in the United States, 1848\n*[[Jerry Rescue]], 1851\n*[[The Angola Horror|Angola Horror]] train wreck, 1867 <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.catskillarchive.com/rrextra/wkbkch02.Html |title=Notes on Railroad Accidents - 1879 |website=Catskillarchive.com |date=July 11, 2007 |accessdate=October 23, 2016}}</ref>\n*First execution via the [[electric chair]], in [[Auburn Prison]] in 1890\n*[[William McKinley assassination|Assassination of President William McKinley]] in Buffalo, 1901\n*Anarchist [[Leon Czolgosz]], McKinley's assassin, convicted at trial and electrocuted in [[Auburn Prison]], 1901\n*[[Split Rock, New York|Split Rock]] Explosion, 1918\n*[[Remington Rand strike of 1936\u20131937]]\n*[[Continental Charters Flight 44-2]], 1951\n*[[Allegheny Reservoir]] construction, 1961\u20131967\n*[[Northeast Blackout of 1965]]\n*[[Woodstock]] music festival, 1969\n*[[Attica Prison riot]], 1971\n*[[Hurricane Agnes]], 1972\n*Collapse of [[New York State Thruway]] bridge over [[Schoharie Creek]], 1987 <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eng.uab.edu/cee/faculty/ndelatte/case_studies_project/Schoharie.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=July 30, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061007211915/http://www.eng.uab.edu/cee/faculty/ndelatte/case_studies_project/Schoharie.htm |archivedate=October 7, 2006 }}</ref>\n*[[New York State Labor Day derechos]], 1998\n*[[Northeast Blackout of 2003]]\n*[[Continental Airlines Flight 3407]], 2009\n*[[Binghamton shootings]], 2009\n*[[Hurricane Irene (2011)|Hurricane Irene]], 2011\n*[[Tropical Storm Lee (2011)|Tropical Storm Lee]], 2011\n*[[Clinton Correctional Facility escape]], 2015\n\n===Journalists===\n*[[Gordon Ackerman]]\n*[[Samuel Hopkins Adams]], muckraker, born in [[Dunkirk, New York|Dunkirk]]\n*[[Wolf Blitzer]] was raised in [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]]\n*[[Amy Dickinson]], ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' advice columnist, who grew up on a dairy farm in [[Freeville, New York|Freeville]]\n*[[Frederick Douglass]] (1818&ndash;1895), editor and publisher of abolitionist newspapers: ''[[North Star (newspaper)|The North Star]]'', published in Rochester, ''Frederick Douglass Weekly'', ''Frederick Douglass' Paper'', ''Douglass' Monthly'' and ''New National Era''.\n*[[Ira Joe Fisher]], author and weatherman, who was born and raised in [[Little Valley (village), New York|Little Valley]]\n*[[Megyn Kelly]]\n*[[Verlyn Klinkenborg]], member of the ''[[New York Times]]'' editorial board; writer and farmer\n*[[Francis Mallison]] of [[Rome, New York|Rome]].

The region saw many battles between the [[Continental Army]] and the Iroquois, and several treaties drawn up after the war ceded much of the land to settlers of European descent. It is largely rural with rugged terrain.\n\nUpstate New York was transformed by the opening of the [[Erie Canal]] in 1825, which greatly eased the movement of goods from the upper midwest, the cities along the [[Great Lakes]], and Upstate New York, to the port of New York City. As a result, Upstate became a hotbed for manufacturing, giving birth to such firms as [[General Electric]], [[IBM]], [[Kodak]], and [[Xerox]], and it welcomed a large influx of immigrants.

The [[Catskill Mountains|Catskills]] supply New York City's water.  The region is home to several popular tourist and recreational destinations, including [[Niagara Falls]], the [[Adirondack Mountains|Adirondack]] and [[Catskill Mountains]], and the [[Finger Lakes]], the latter created by retreating [[glacier]]s.\n\nBecause of its geography, rivers have played a very important role in Upstate New York's history. All the above cities are on navigable or formerly navigable rivers or lakes. Until railroads arrived around 1850, New York ran on rivers: the [[Hudson River|Hudson]], its tributary the [[Mohawk River|Mohawk]], and to a lesser extent the [[Susquehanna River|Susquehanna]] and its tributary the [[Chemung River|Chemung]]. There was regular [[steamboat]] service along the Hudson River between New York City and Albany beginning in 1807, the first such regular service in the world. There was regular commercial and passenger transportation along the Mohawk in small boats until the Erie Canal opened. Utica, which is about as far as you can go on the Mohawk, was in the early nineteenth century a busy port and the economic capital of western New York. The Erie Canal was the biggest and most expensive engineering project in the world up to that date, and even if upstream speed was at first that of a mule, its economic importance was immense, and it transformed the state of New York.\n\n==Definition==\n[[File:Map of New York Highlighting New York City.svg|thumb|right|New York City is highlighted in red; \"Upstate\" refers to some or all of the area north and west of the city.]]\n[[File:Bear Mtn Bridge.jpg|thumb|The [[Bear Mountain Bridge]] across the [[Hudson River]], as seen from [[Bear Mountain (Hudson Highlands)|Bear Mountain]].

Most of New York State is characterized both by agricultural and forested rural communities, and by small and medium-sized cities and their surrounding suburbs located along major transportation corridors.  The state's major metropolitan areas outside of New York City are Buffalo, Rochester, Albany-Schenectady-Troy, and Syracuse, each of whose population exceeds 500,000.\n\nThe different regions of New York State are influenced by and have affinities with other adjacent regions.  Western New York has cultural and economic ties to the other [[Great Lakes region (North America)|Great Lakes states]] as well as [[Southern Ontario]].  The [[Capital District, New York|Capital District]], the Hudson Valley, the [[Mohawk Valley]] and the [[Plattsburgh (city), New York|Plattsburgh]] area have ties to [[New England]]. The North Country, the extreme northern portion of the state, also has strong cultural, economic, linguistic and familial ties to [[Quebec]] and [[Eastern Ontario]].  Thus, Plattsburgh has close ties to its neighbors in the Montreal area as well as Vermont.  Much of New York State receives television and radio broadcasts from Canada and there are often other cross-border ties, both historical and familial.  A similar relationship can be seen in Northern [[New England]].\n\nLinguistically, upstate New York from Western New York east to [[Utica, New York|Utica]] is part of the [[Inland Northern American English|Inland North]] region of American English dialectology, a region which includes Midwestern cities as far west as [[Chicago]] and [[Milwaukee]]. The Hudson and lower Mohawk Valley has more in common dialectologically with western New England and New York City.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ling.upenn.edu/~dinkin/GapHandout.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=October 5, 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070925234304/http://www.ling.upenn.edu/~dinkin/GapHandout.pdf |archivedate=September 25, 2007 }}</ref>  The boundary between the use of the words ''pop'' and ''soda'' to refer to soft drinks, however, falls farther west than the edge of the Inland North, running just to around the city of Rochester: Buffalo and areas west of Rochester use ''pop'', like the rest of the Inland North to the west, whereas areas east of Rochester, like Syracuse and Binghamton, use ''soda'', like New England and New York City. In Ithaca and Elmira, the border is less clear, with some people having grown up with ''pop'' and some with ''soda''; however, current trends see Ithaca, at least, turning to mostly \"soda.\"\n\n[[File:Swami opening.jpg|thumb|Opening ceremony at [[Woodstock Festival|Woodstock]]]]\n\n[[Foodways]] indigenous to regions of Upstate New York include:\n* [[Buffalo wings]] and [[beef on weck sandwich]] (Buffalo)\n*the [[Robert C.

In the center of the Finger Lakes region, [[Ithaca, New York|Ithaca]] is known for the Bo Burger, a cheeseburger with a fried egg on top.\n\nTwo of the most important [[rock festival]]s of the 20th century were held in Upstate New York. In 1969 the [[Woodstock Festival]] was held in [[Bethel, New York]], while in 1973 another [[Summer Jam at Watkins Glen|multiday festival]] was held at the [[Watkins Glen International Raceway]].\n\nSome literary, documentary and cinematic depictions of upstate present a sense of small town, simple lifestyles, such as ''[[It's a Wonderful Life]]'', set in a small upstate town (probably based on [[Seneca Falls, New York|Seneca Falls]]) in the 1940s.\n\n==Demographics==\n[[File:Census-2000-Data-Top-US-Ancestries-by-County.svg|thumb|right|Ancestries from across the United States]] \nThe population of New York State is 19,746,227, with 11,323,961 living in either New York City or Long Island,{{when|date=January 2019}} leaving 8,422,266 for the entire rest of the state. This means Upstate NY has a population density far lower than that of downstate. Upstate is typified by farmland and forest, many large lakes, and two (major) mountain ranges, with a few metro areas dotting the map.\nResidents of [[English Americans|English]] colonial ancestry are common, as well as [[German Americans|German]], [[Irish Americans|Irish]], and [[Italian Americans|Italian]], with most metropolitan counties having a similar number of residents from each group.  The North Country is heavily French Canadian. Italian Americans are the largest ethnic group in [[Oneida County, New York|Oneida County]], [[Schenectady County, New York|Schenectady County]], as well as in some counties in the [[Hudson Valley]] that are closest to [[New York City]]. Irish Americans represent the largest ethnic group from the Capital District, Syracuse, Binghamton, and the rest of the Hudson Valley, though they also have large Italian American populations; Irish population is consistently above 15% in most of upstate New York (reaching over 20% in the upper Hudson Valley), compared to less than 8% in most of New York City.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.syracuse.com/news/index.ssf/2015/03/which_county_is_the_most_irish_in_new_york_state_list.html|title=Which county is the most Irish in New York state?

[[African Americans]], while not as numerous as in New York City, make up at least 25% of the residents in cities such as Buffalo, Rochester, Syracuse, and Albany.\n\nThere is also a significant presence of the indigenous [[Iroquois|Haudenosaunee]] or Six Nations in the region, who retain several reservations: the [[Seneca nation]] and [[Tonawanda Band of Seneca Indians]] in Western New York, the [[Onondaga nation]] south of Syracuse, the [[Oneida nation]] of Oneida County and the [[Mohawk nation]] in [[Franklin County, New York|Franklin County]]. Members of the Six Nations also live in the cities of Upstate New York.\n\n== Geography ==\n[[File:Whiteface Mountain from Lake Placid Airport.JPG|thumb|[[Whiteface Mountain]], in the [[Adirondack Mountains|Adirondacks]]]]\nThe headwaters of the [[Delaware River|Delaware]], [[Susquehanna River|Susquehanna]], Hudson, and [[Allegheny River|Allegheny]] rivers are located in the region. The region is characterized by the major mountain ranges, large lakes, and extensive forests.\n\n[[File:Canisteo valley 1453.JPG|left|thumb|Canisteo River Valley in the [[Allegheny Plateau]]]]\nThe [[Allegheny Plateau]] extends into west and central New York from the south. The Catskill Mountains lie in the southeastern part of the state, closer to New York City. The Catskills and the Allegheny Plateau are both part of the [[Appalachian Mountains]]. The northernmost part of the state contains the Adirondack Mountains, which are sometimes considered part of the Appalachians but are geologically separate, a southern extension of the [[Canadian Shield]].\n\nIn the more mountainous eastern part of Upstate New York, the valleys of the Hudson River and the [[Mohawk River]] were historically important travel corridors and remain so today. Western New York in the vicinity of Buffalo is very flat, as it was once the bottom of a glacial lake. The only \"hills\" in [[Niagara County, New York|Niagara County]] are the [[Niagara Escarpment]], which formed the [[Niagara Falls|Falls]].\n\nUpstate has a long shared border with Canadian province of [[Ontario]] divided by water; including the [[Lake Erie]], [[Niagara River]], [[Lake Ontario]] and the St. Lawrence River. It shares a land border with the province of [[Quebec]] in the northernmost part of the state.\n\nThe sizes of upstate counties and towns are generally larger in area and smaller in population, compared with the downstate region, although there are exceptions. The state's smallest county in population ([[Hamilton County, New York|Hamilton County]]) and largest county in area ([[St. Lawrence County, New York|St. Lawrence County]] on the state's northern border) are both in Upstate New York, while the largest in population ([[Kings County, New York|Kings County]]) and smallest in area ([[Manhattan|New York County]]) are both part of New York City.\n\n===Climate===\n[[File:NYlakeeffectsnow.png|thumb|left|upright=1.15|Average seasonal snowfall totals for areas subject to lake-effect snow in New York (in inches).<ref name=NWS_snowseason>{{cite web|title=Average Seasonal Snowfall Over the Eastern Great Lakes Region |url=http://www.erh.noaa.gov/er/buf/lakeffect/snowseason.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131210074031/http://www.erh.noaa.gov/er/buf/lakeffect/snowseason.html |archivedate=December 10, 2013 |url-status=dead |website=Erh.noaa.gov |author=NOAA's National Weather Service |accessdate=January 31, 2015}}</ref>]]Upstate New York is well known for its cold and snowy winters, particularly in comparison to the more temperate climate of downstate New York.

The conflict between the two peoples continued through the period of early European colonization, and the French, Dutch and English tended to ally with their trading partners among the indigenous peoples. The Haudenosaunee or [[Iroquois confederacy]] of the Five (later Six) Nations was a powerful force in its home territory. The Five Nations' territory extended from the Mohawk River Valley through the western part of the state and into current Pennsylvania. From this home base they also controlled at various times large swaths of additional territory throughout what is now the northeastern United States. The [[Guswhenta (Two Row Wampum Treaty)]], made with the Dutch government in 1613, codified relations between the Haudenosaunee and European colonizers, and formed the basis of subsequent treaties. In the mid-17th century, during the [[Beaver Wars]], the Iroquois were victorious and dominated the tribes of [[Neutral Nation|Neutral Indians]], [[Wenrohronon]] and the [[Erie (tribe)|Erie Indians]] in Western New York. (Survivors were mostly assimilated into the [[Seneca people]] of the Iroquois; some are believed to have escaped to South Carolina, where they merged with other Indian tribes.)\n\nThe region was important from the first days of both [[France|French]] and [[Netherlands|Dutch]] colonization In the seventeenth century.  The [[New Netherland]] colony encompassed the Hudson Valley from Manhattan island north to the confluence of the Hudson and Mohawk rivers, where [[Fort Orange]] (later Albany) was established in 1623. The fort at [[Schenectady, New York]] was built in 1661.  The upper Hudson Valley was the center of much of the colony's [[fur trade]], which was highly lucrative, serving a demand for furs in Europe.\n\nNorth and west of New Netherland, the French established trading posts along the St. Lawrence River and as far south as the shores of [[Onondaga Lake]]. They found both trading and proselytizing difficult among the Haudenosaunee, as [[Samuel de Champlain]] had alienated the Haudenosaunee during military forays from [[New France]].  In the 1640s, three [[Jesuit missions in North America#Missions|French Jesuit missionaries]] to New France \u2014St. [[Ren\u00e9 Goupil]], St. [[Isaac Jogues]], and St. [[Jean de Lalande]]\u2014were killed near the Mohawk village of Ossernenon, which was located at the confluence of the Schoharie and Mohawk rivers, where the modern town of [[Auriesville, New York|Auriesville]] was later developed. They are considered to be the first three [[List of American saints and beatified people|U.S. saints]].\n\nEngland seized New Netherland by force in 1664, renaming it New York.  The Dutch recaptured the colony nine years later, but ceded it to England under the [[Treaty of Westminster (1674)|Treaty of Westminster]] of 1674.\n\nIn the eighteenth century, the British consolidated their hold on the region.  [[Sir William Johnson, 1st Baronet|William Johnson]], a Scottish trader, established an estate in the Mohawk Valley, living among the Mohawk, learning their language, and forging an alliance with them. He was appointed as the British Indian agent to the Iroquois. The British also encouraged settlement in the Mohawk Valley by other Europeans, including [[German Palatines]] beginning in the 1720s.\n\nIn what became known as the [[Albany Congress]] in 1754, delegates from seven of the thirteen British North American colonies met at Albany to pursue a treaty with the powerful Mohawk. [[Benjamin Franklin]], a Pennsylvania delegate, proposed a plan for uniting the seven colonies that greatly exceeded the scope of the congress. The delegates spent most of their time debating this [[Albany Plan]] of union, one of the first attempts to form a union of the [[Thirteen Colonies|colonies]] \"under one government as far as might be necessary for defense and other general important purposes\".<ref>''The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin'', Second Edition.  Yale University Press, 1964. pp.209-210</ref>  The delegates approved an amended version, but the colonies rejected it.\n\nTo counter the French militarily, the British established forts along Lake Ontario and at portages between the Mohawk Valley and the adjacent Lake Champlain and Lake Ontario watersheds. The region became the area for many conflicts of the [[French and Indian War]], such as the [[Battle of Fort Oswego (1756)]] and the [[Siege of Fort William Henry]] (which was later depicted in the work of [[James Fenimore Cooper]]), during the [[Seven Years' War]].\n\nThe British conquered New France by 1760 with the fall of Quebec.  France formally ceded New France to the British in the [[Treaty of Paris of 1763]].  The same year, [[King George III]] issued the [[Royal Proclamation of 1763]], which established the western and northern boundary of the Province of New York at the limits of the Hudson, Mohawk and Delaware River watersheds.  The area between that boundary and the Great Lakes and Saint Lawrence River, including west of the Appalachian Mountains, was to be the \"[[Indian Reserve (1763)|Indian Reserve]].\"\n\n===American Revolution===\n\n[[File:Incident in cherry valley.jpg|thumb|[[Cherry Valley massacre]]]]\nBetween 1774 and 1783, deeply divided colonists waged civil war on each other directly and by proxy, through attacks such as the Seneca-led [[Cherry Valley massacre|Cherry Valley]] and the Mohawk-led [[Battle of Cobleskill|Cobleskill]] massacre.  In 1779, the [[Sullivan Expedition]], a campaign by the Continental Army ordered by General [[George Washington]], drove thousands of the Haudenosaunee from their villages, farms and lands in the region in an effort to both avenge and prevent such attacks.\n\nThe region was strategically important to the war plans of both the British and the Continental forces.  British efforts to divide the New England colonies from the rest led to battles including the [[Battle of Valcour Island]] and the [[Battle of Saratoga]], a significant turning point in the war.  While New York City remained in the hands of the British during most of the war, the upstate region was eventually dominated by the Colonial forces.  At the end of the war, the Continental Army was headquartered in Newburgh.  Uncertain that the Continental Congress would pay back wages, some Continental officers threatened an uprising in what became known as the [[Newburgh Conspiracy]].\n\n===Post-revolutionary period===\nAfter the American Revolution, the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] established the border between New York and [[British North America]]. The 45th Parallel became the border with Quebec or [[Lower Canada]].  The St. Lawrence River, Lake Ontario, the Niagara River and Lake Erie became the border with [[Upper Canada]].  Great Britain continued to occupy military installations along the American shores of the Great Lakes until 1794, including Fort Niagara at the mouth of the Niagara River and Fort Ontario at the mouth of the Oswego River.\n\nThe government of the new State of New York seized the property of New Yorkers who had remained loyal to the British crown.  Thousands emigrated to colonies that remained under British rule, such as Nova Scotia and the newly established Upper Canada (now [[Ontario]]).  Haudenosaunee who had fought with the British also fled.  The British Crown granted a large tract of land in Upper Canada to their Haudenosaunee allies, who established the [[Six Nations of the Grand River First Nation|Grand River]] settlement.\n\nIn the federal [[Treaty of Canandaigua]], the new United States recognized the title of the remaining Haudenosaunee to the land north and west of the Proclamation Line of 1763. Nevertheless, New York state officials and private land agents sought through the early 19th century to extinguish Indian title to these lands via non-Federally-sanctioned treaties, such as the [[Treaty of Big Tree]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oswego.edu/library2/archives/digitized_collections/granger/bigtree.html |title=Iroquois Bio |website=Oswego.edu |date= |accessdate=October 23, 2016}}</ref> The [[Treaties of Buffalo Creek]] were designed to finally remove the last of the native claims in Western New York as part of the federal [[Indian Removal]] program, but the purchaser failed to buy most of the land in time, and some of the tribes objected to their exclusion. Three of the four reservations remain in the region to this day; one of the reservations leased out their land to form the city of [[Salamanca (city), New York|Salamanca]], and the coexistence of the predominantly white city and the reservation has been a source of contention since the 1990s.\n\nBoth before and after the Revolution, boundary disputes with other colonies and their successor states also complicated American settlement. In conflict with [[New York Colony]]'s claims west of the Hudson Valley, which placed the entire region in the sprawling [[Albany County, New York|Albany County]], [[Pennsylvania Colony]] claimed much of the [[Southern Tier]] until 1774, while [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]] claimed all of the region west of Massachusetts to the Great Lakes.\n\nThe Province of New York also claimed jurisdiction east to the Connecticut River.  To pursue this claim north of Connecticut and Massachusetts, New York granted lands to settlers in what is now Vermont at the same time that New Hampshire made grants of the same lands. When Vermont declared independence in 1777, the new Republic of Vermont recognized the New Hampshire grants over those of New York. New Yorkers who lost land in Vermont came to be known as the \"Vermont Sufferers\" and were granted new lands in 1788 in the Town of [[Bainbridge (town), New York|Bainbridge, New York]].\n\nThe dispute with Massachusetts over lands to the west of Massachusetts was settled in the 1786 [[Treaty of Hartford (1786)|Treaty of Hartford]] by dividing the rights to the land. The treaty granted sovereignty to the State of New York, but granted to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts the \"pre-emptive\" right to seek title to the land from the Haudenosaunee. The eastern boundary of the Massachusetts lands was thus known as the [[Preemption Line]]. This line runs from the Pennsylvania line due north to Lake Ontario, passing through Seneca Lake. The line was surveyed a second time due to initial errors.  The Commonwealth of Massachusetts sold this land in large tracts, including the [[Phelps and Gorham Purchase]] and the [[Holland Purchase]].\n\nMany of the settlers of what then became Central and Western New York came from the New England states. The [[Central New York Military Tract]], where many of the townships were given the names of classical military and literary figures by [[Robert Harpur]], was established to grant land to Revolutionary War veterans. Some of Northern New York was founded by the hundreds of Canadian exiles who had fought in the [[1st Canadian Regiment|First]] and [[2nd Canadian Regiment|Second Canadian Regiments]] of the [[Continental Army]], who were banished from Canada due to their rebellion against the Crown.\n\n===19th century===\n[[File:Battleofpburg.jpg|thumb|1816 engraving of the [[Battle of Plattsburgh]]]]\nBattles of the [[War of 1812]] (1812&ndash;1815) were fought on the [[Niagara Frontier]], in the [[Champlain Valley]], including the [[Battle of Plattsburgh]], in the [[St. Lawrence Valley]], and on [[Lake Ontario]], including the Battle of [[Sackets Harbor]]. The city of Buffalo was razed by the British as well.<ref name=\"Burning of Buffalo\">{{cite web|title=The Burning of Buffalo, NY|url=http://buffalonian.com/history/articles/1801-50/TheBurningofBuffalo.html|work=The Buffalonian|publisher=The People's History Coalition|accessdate=April 26, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130824075504/http://www.buffalonian.com/history/articles/1801-50/TheBurningofBuffalo.html|archive-date=August 24, 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>  After the war, the US Government began to construct [[Fort Montgomery (Lake Champlain)|Fort Montgomery]] just south of the border at [[Rouses Point]] on [[Lake Champlain]]. Subsequently, it was discovered that at that point, the actual 45th parallel was three-quarters of a mile south of the surveyed line, putting the Fort, which became known as \"Fort Blunder\", in Canada. This was not resolved until 1842 with the [[Webster-Ashburton Treaty]], in which Great Britain and the United States decided to leave the border on the meandering line as surveyed.\n\n[[History of slavery in New York|Slavery]] existed in [[New Netherland]] and the [[Province of New York]]. New York was in the 1690s the largest importer of slaves among the American colonies. Slavery did not end with the [[American Revolution]], although [[John Jay]] introduced an emancipation bill into the State Assembly as early as 1777. [[Sojourner Truth]] was held as a slave in the [[Hudson Valley]] from the time she was born in 1797 until she escaped in 1826. Through efforts of the [[New York Manumission Society]] and others, New York began to adopt a policy of gradual emancipation in 1799. The law passed in 1817 that would finally emancipate slaves did not take effect for ten years, giving slaveowners an entire decade to sell their slaves away to other states. When the law finally took effect, the last 2,800 slaves in New York State were emancipated on July 4, 1827.\n\n[[File:Lockport bartlett color crop.jpg|left|thumb|[[Erie Canal]] at [[Lockport, New York]], in 1839]]\nAlthough routes for travel on foot and by canoe had existed across the region for hundreds of years, transportation of agricultural goods to market was expensive and slow.  Influenced by the canals being built in Britain, leading citizens of New York began to press for the construction of a canal across the state.  Governor [[DeWitt Clinton]] prevailed upon the legislature to charter and fund construction of a canal from Albany to Buffalo. Construction of the [[Erie Canal]] began in 1817 and was completed in 1825.  The canal allowed the area to become an important component of the 19th century industrial expansion in the United States. The canal also promoted trade with [[British North America]] and settlement of newer states in western territories. Later in the century the [[New York Central Railroad]] followed the \"water-level route\" from New York City to the Great Lakes, contributing to the industrialization of cities along its route.\n\nSeveral times in the nineteenth century, Upstate New York served as a staging area and refuge for Canadian rebels against Great Britain, as well as Irish-American invaders of Canada, straining British-American relations. In 1837 and 1838, in the aftermath of the [[Lower Canada Rebellion]], some [[French-speaking Quebecer|Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois]] rebels escaped south to the North Country, while on the [[Niagara Frontier]], events of the [[Upper Canada Rebellion]], also known as the [[Patriot War]], took place. In the late 1860s, some of the [[Fenian Raids]] were launched across the Niagara Frontier; [[Fenians]] also assembled in [[Malone (village), New York|Malone]].\n\nAlthough now largely discredited, the report of the 1905\u201307 [[Mills Commission]], charged with investigating the [[origins of baseball]], named [[Cooperstown]] as the place where [[baseball]] was invented in the 1830s or 1840s by [[Abner Doubleday]]. Cooperstown is the home of the National [[Baseball Hall of Fame]] and Museum. (Modern research suggests that the game was actually developed in its modern form in New York City.)\n\nIn the pre-Civil War era, Upstate New York became a major center of radical [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] activity and was an important nexus of the [[Underground Railroad]]. Resistance to the [[Fugitive Slave Act]] was particularly heated in the region, as evidenced by such events as the [[Jerry Rescue]]. The American [[women's rights]] movement was also born in Upstate New York at this time. The [[Seneca Falls Convention]], the first women's rights convention, was held at [[Seneca Falls (village), New York|Seneca Falls]] in 1848.  The [[Rochester Women's Rights Convention of 1848|Rochester Convention]], the second such convention, was held two weeks later in [[Rochester, New York|Rochester]].\n\nThrough the nineteenth century, Upstate New York was a hotbed of religious revivalism. A number of sects, such as the [[Shakers]] and the [[Oneida Community]], established themselves in Upstate New York during that time. This led evangelist [[Charles Grandison Finney]] to coin the term the \"[[Burned-Over District]]\" for the region. Because of the comparative isolation of the region, many of the sects were non-conformist, and because of their non-traditional tenets they had numerous difficulties with government and other local people. The region is considered to be the cradle of [[Mormonism]], as well as the [[Women's Suffrage]] movement. The [[Mormon]]s, [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventists]] and [[Spiritualism (religious movement)|Spiritualists]] are the only 21st century survivors of the hundreds of sects created during this time; some more mainstream churches, such as the [[Wesleyan Church]] and [[Free Methodist Church]] (both offshoots of Methodism that originated in political disputes with the mainline [[Methodist Episcopal Church|Methodist church]]), also survive.\n\nIn the 19th century, extractive industries changed the landscape.  [[Potash]] was manufactured as the land was cleared for farming. [[Logging]] was rampant in the Adirondacks. [[Iron]] was mined in the Adirondacks and the North Country. By the 1870s, business leaders, concerned about the effect of deforestation on the water supply necessary to the Erie Canal, advocated for the creation of forest preserves in the Adirondacks and the Catskills. The [[Adirondack Park]] and [[Catskill Park]] were created and strengthened by a series of legislation between 1885 and 1894, when the \"[[Forever wild]]\" provision of the [[New York State Constitution]] was added.\n\n===20th century===\n[[File:Harvard Mark I.jpg|thumb|[[Harvard Mark I]], one of the earliest [[computer]]s, made by [[IBM]] in [[Endicott, New York|Endicott]]]]\nDuring the era immediately following World War II, Upstate reached what was probably its peak influence in the national economy. Major local corporations such as [[IBM]], [[General Electric]], [[Kodak]], [[Xerox]] and [[Carrier Corporation|Carrier]] had national success,  producing cutting-edge products for business, government and consumers, and leadership in corporate culture. The opening of the [[New York State Thruway]] in the mid-1950s gave the region superior access to other eastern markets. This regional advantage faded as many local firms relocated certain operations to other states, or downsized in the face of foreign competition, similar to events in other areas in the American [[Rust Belt]].\n\nSince the late 20th century, with the decline of manufacturing and its jobs, the area has generally suffered a net population loss, most heavily in Western New York.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} By contrast, many [[Amish]] and [[Mennonite]] families are recent arrivals to the area and have helped revive agriculture as part of the economy. Beginning in 1974, many Mennonite families moved to the [[Penn Yan]] area of [[Yates County, New York|Yates County]] from [[Lancaster County, Pennsylvania]], seeking cheaper farmland.  Amish communities have also been established in St. Lawrence, [[Montgomery County, New York|Montgomery]], [[Chautauqua County, New York|Chautauqua]] and [[Cattaraugus County, New York|Cattaraugus]] counties, and are making farming profitable.\n\nArtisans are reviving traditional specialty cheeses, and developing growing markets for their products, including shipping some items to the New York metropolitan market. A Greek-style yogurt, [[Chobani]], is being produced Upstate by a recent immigrant, who has expanded his operation nationally.\n\nAdditionally, Upstate New York continues to boast low crime rates, high educational prospects, and readily affordable daily essentials, earning Syracuse, Rochester, Albany, [[Schenectady, New York|Schenectady]], and Buffalo spots in the ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine list of top ten places to raise a family in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/2010/06/04/best-places-family-lifestyle-real-estate-cities-kids.html|title=America's Best Places To Raise A Family|first=Francesca|last=Levy|date=June 7, 2010|website=Forbes.com|accessdate=October 23, 2016}}</ref>\n\nFive of the six Iroquois nations have filed land claims against New York State (or have sought settlement of pending claims), based on late 18th-century treaties following the [[American Revolutionary War]] with the [[State of New York]] (which did not have constitutional authority to treat with American Indian nations) and the United States.\n\n==Economy==\n{{Expand section|date=October 2015}}\n{{main|Innovation and business in Upstate New York}}\n\n==Politics==\n{{main|Politics of Upstate New York}}\nOften attributed to the region's semi-rural to rural character, there is more [[Conservatism in the United States|conservatism]] in culture and politics than found in the more urban downstate area, and the region is the power base of the state's [[New York Republican State Committee|Republican Party]]. Upstate New York does however have several [[New York State Democratic Committee|Democratic]]-dominated counties, including [[Erie County, New York|Erie County]] (Buffalo), [[Monroe County, New York|Monroe County]] (Rochester), [[Onondaga County, New York|Onondaga County]] (Syracuse), [[Tompkins County, New York|Tompkins County]] (Ithaca), and [[Albany County, New York|Albany County]] (Albany).\n\nAs a whole, Upstate New York is roughly equally divided in federal elections between Democrats and Republicans. In [[U.S. presidential election, 2004, in New York|2004]], [[John Kerry]] defeated [[George W. Bush]] by fewer than 1,500 votes (1,553,246 votes to 1,551,971) in the Upstate Region.\n\n=== Relationship with New York City ===\n{{see also|Secession in New York#Upstate secession|label 1=Upstate secession}}\nNew York City is dependent on upstate for a variety of services; the latter is the source of the city's water supply via the [[Delaware Aqueduct]] and the [[Catskill Aqueduct]]; much of the city's electric power supply comes from state owned [[Niagara Falls hydroelectric generating plants|hydroelectric plants at Niagara Falls]] and the [[St. Lawrence River]]; and most of the state's prisons are upstate; hence the popular term \"being sent up the river\" (however, the term originally referred to [[Sing Sing]], which is \"up the Hudson River\" from New York City, but being in [[Ossining (town), New York|Ossining]] in [[Westchester County]] is still in the \"downstate\" region). Conversely, the operation of state facilities providing these services is an important part of the upstate economy.\n\n== Historic events ==\n<!--Keep in chronological order-->\n*[[Battle of Valcour Island]], 1776\n*[[Battle of Oriskany]], 1777\n*[[Battles of Saratoga]], turning point of the [[American Revolutionary War]], 1777\n*[[Cherry Valley massacre]], 1778\n*[[Sullivan Campaign]], 1779\n*[[Second Great Awakening]] in the [[burned-over district]], early 1800s\n*[[William Morgan (anti-Mason)|The Morgan Affair]], 1826\n*Publication of the [[Book of Mormon]], 1830\n*[[Seneca Falls Convention]], the first [[women's rights]] convention held in the United States, 1848\n*[[Jerry Rescue]], 1851\n*[[The Angola Horror|Angola Horror]] train wreck, 1867 <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.catskillarchive.com/rrextra/wkbkch02.Html |title=Notes on Railroad Accidents - 1879 |website=Catskillarchive.com |date=July 11, 2007 |accessdate=October 23, 2016}}</ref>\n*First execution via the [[electric chair]], in [[Auburn Prison]] in 1890\n*[[William McKinley assassination|Assassination of President William McKinley]] in Buffalo, 1901\n*Anarchist [[Leon Czolgosz]], McKinley's assassin, convicted at trial and electrocuted in [[Auburn Prison]], 1901\n*[[Split Rock, New York|Split Rock]] Explosion, 1918\n*[[Remington Rand strike of 1936\u20131937]]\n*[[Continental Charters Flight 44-2]], 1951\n*[[Allegheny Reservoir]] construction, 1961\u20131967\n*[[Northeast Blackout of 1965]]\n*[[Woodstock]] music festival, 1969\n*[[Attica Prison riot]], 1971\n*[[Hurricane Agnes]], 1972\n*Collapse of [[New York State Thruway]] bridge over [[Schoharie Creek]], 1987 <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eng.uab.edu/cee/faculty/ndelatte/case_studies_project/Schoharie.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=July 30, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061007211915/http://www.eng.uab.edu/cee/faculty/ndelatte/case_studies_project/Schoharie.htm |archivedate=October 7, 2006 }}</ref>\n*[[New York State Labor Day derechos]], 1998\n*[[Northeast Blackout of 2003]]\n*[[Continental Airlines Flight 3407]], 2009\n*[[Binghamton shootings]], 2009\n*[[Hurricane Irene (2011)|Hurricane Irene]], 2011\n*[[Tropical Storm Lee (2011)|Tropical Storm Lee]], 2011\n*[[Clinton Correctional Facility escape]], 2015\n\n===Journalists===\n*[[Gordon Ackerman]]\n*[[Samuel Hopkins Adams]], muckraker, born in [[Dunkirk, New York|Dunkirk]]\n*[[Wolf Blitzer]] was raised in [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]]\n*[[Amy Dickinson]], ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' advice columnist, who grew up on a dairy farm in [[Freeville, New York|Freeville]]\n*[[Frederick Douglass]] (1818&ndash;1895), editor and publisher of abolitionist newspapers: ''[[North Star (newspaper)|The North Star]]'', published in Rochester, ''Frederick Douglass Weekly'', ''Frederick Douglass' Paper'', ''Douglass' Monthly'' and ''New National Era''.\n*[[Ira Joe Fisher]], author and weatherman, who was born and raised in [[Little Valley (village), New York|Little Valley]]\n*[[Megyn Kelly]]\n*[[Verlyn Klinkenborg]], member of the ''[[New York Times]]'' editorial board; writer and farmer\n*[[Francis Mallison]] of [[Rome, New York|Rome]].

{"title_page": "Supervisor Call instruction", "text_new": "{{multiple issues|\n{{notability|date=September 2012}}\n{{more citations needed|date=September 2012}}\n}}\n\nA '''Supervisor Call instruction''' ('''SVC''') is a hardware [[Instruction (computer science)|instruction]] in the [[System/360]] family of [[IBM mainframe]] computers up to contemporary [[zSeries]] (as well as non-IBM mainframe computers such as the [[Amdahl Corporation|Amdahl]] 470V/5, 470V/6, 470V/7, 470V/8, 580, 5880, 5990M, and 5990A, and others; Univac [[UNIVAC Series 90|90/60]], 90/70 and 90/80, and possibly others; and the Fujitsu M180 (UP), and M200 (MP), and others) used to cause an interrupt to request a service from the [[operating system]].  The system routine providing the service is called an ''SVC routine''.  SVC is a specific implementation of a [[system call]].\n\n==Rationale==\nIBM mainframes in the System/360 and successor families operate in one of two states: ''problem state'' or ''supervisor state'' and in one of sixteen storage access keys (0 to 15). In ''problem state'', a large set of general purpose ''non-privileged'' instructions are available to a user program. In ''supervisor state'', system programs are additionally able to use a small set of ''privileged'' instructions which are generally intended for supervisory functions. These functions may affect other users, other processors, or the entire computer system. In storage key 0 a program is able to access all of storage.\nA program is only allowed to access specific supervisory functions after thorough authorization checking by the operating system: DEBCHK (SVC 117), TESTAUTH (SVC 119), and possibly additional tests. Programs which fail any of these tests are ABENDed, that is ''abnormally terminated'' and immediately cease processing. Some of these tests were not available in OS/360, but were added in [[OS/VS1]], [[OS/VS2 (SVS)|SVS]] or [[MVS/370]], but all were available in MVS/370 or subsequent releases, and are still available to this day.\n\nIn [[OS/VS1]], [[OS/VS2 (SVS)]], [[MVS/370]] and subsequent versions of the OS, the MODESET function (SVC 107) obviated the need for many user-written SVCs as this system SVC accommodated both changes in mode (problem state to supervisor state) and key (8-15 [ user ] to 0-7 [ system ] ) in a single operation, and many user-written SVCs were originally intended for simple mode and key changes, anyway, and subsequently the only special requirement was that the jobstep be APF authorized{{efn|Initially this meant that the jobstep program was linked with AC(1) and came from an authorized concatenation of libraries. TSO/E later added a facility for authorized TSO commands.}}{{efn|several system libraries were always implicitly part of the concatenation}} and that the MODESET-invoking program be resident in a concatenation of libraries all of which were identified as authorized, and this secure approach was completely under the installation's control. This approach generally simplified user controls over authorization, although some simple changes to the application were thereby required. In general, user installations favored this approach, and the overall reliability of the system was significantly improved thereby.\n\nAlthough mainframe applications are typically ''synchronous'' processes, the operating system itself is naturally ''asynchronous'', although the system also supports many processes which are naturally ''synchronous''.  When an application requests a system service which is naturally ''asynchronous'', such as input/output processing, a mechanism for synchronizing the application and the operating system must be employed. This essential mechanism is through functions which are built into the operating system, or are specifically supported by it, including: WAIT (temporarily halt application processing until an external event has occurred); POST (indicate occurrence of an external event so application processing may continue); and SYNCH (change system processing mode\u2014supervisor to user and system key to user key\u2014while preserving system integrity, and synchronously perform a function on behalf of the application, after which supervisor processing may continue).\n\nThe [[Supervisor Call instruction#OS/360 SVCs|OS/360 SVCs]] table below indicates the conditions under which these synchronizing facilities may be employed.\n\n==Implementation==\nSVC is a two byte instruction with the [[Opcode|operation code]] of 0A0x; the second byte, the ''SVC number'',  indicates the specific request.<ref>{{cite book|last=IBM Corporation|title=IBM System/360 Principles of Operation|pages=72|url=http://www.bitsavers.org/pdf/ibm/360/princOps/A22-6821-0_360PrincOps.pdf}}</ref>\n\nSVC invokes a supervisory function&mdash;usually implemented as a \"closed subroutine\" of the system's SVC [[interrupt handler]].  Information passed to and from the SVC routines is passed in [[Processor register|general purpose registers]] or in memory. \n    \nUnder IBM-developed operating systems, return from an SVC routine is, for type 2, 3 and 4 SVC routines, via an SVC 3 (EXIT) invocation, and for other SVC types by the privileged ''Load PSW'' (LPSW) instruction, and which is executed on behalf of the SVC routine by the control program's [[Scheduling (computing)#Dispatcher|dispatcher]]<!-- E.g., POST may require dispatch of a higher priority task --> or SVC interrupt handler.\n\nOn non-IBM developed operating systems such as [[MUSIC/SP]] developed by [[McGill University]] in Montreal, Canada for IBM mainframes, and for non-IBM mainframes, [[VS/9]], developed by Univac (from the [[Time Sharing Operating System|TSOS]] operating system for the [[RCA Spectra 70]] series computers) for the [[UNIVAC Series 90]] mainframe line, and the B800 operating system (also developed from the TSOS operating system) for [[Fujitsu]]'s mainfames, all use the LPSW instruction to exit from a Supervisor Call.\n\nIn MVS/370 and later incarnations of the OS, branch and link entry points are alternatives to SVC invocations for supervisor mode routines. \nIn MVS/SP V1R3 and later incarnations of the OS, Program  Call (PC) entries have augmented SVCs for invocations of many supervisory functions by both authorized and unauthorized programs; and some functions may only be invoked by branch or PC entries, e.g. [[Start Input/Output]].\n\nDifferent IBM operating systems have little compatibility in the specific codes used or in the supervisor services which may be invoked.  [[VM (operating system)|VM/370 and z/VM]] systems use the DIAG instruction in a similar manner, and leave SVC for the use by operating systems running in virtual machines.  Most OS/360 SVCs have been maintained for \"legacy\" programs, but some SVCs have been \"extended\" over the passage of time.\n\n==OS/360 and Successor System SVCs==\nIn OS/360 and successor systems SVC numbers 0 through approximately 127 are defined by IBM, and 255 downwards are available for use by an installation's systems programming staff. z/OS changed this to SVC numbers 0 through approximately 200 for IBM, and 255 downwards for the installation, as additional system services, primarily in support of encryption/decryption, were being implemented by IBM using SVCs. SVC routines must have module names in a specific format beginning with IGC.\n\nBy system design, the term \"disabled\" means disabled for all interruptions except for machine check interruptions in pre-MVS/370 systems, and with the \"local lock\" being held, but not \"disabled\" for any interruptions in MVS/370 and all later systems. The former is physical disablement, the latter is logical disablement, as an address space's \"local lock\" has the same impact within its address space as physical disablement, but it has no impact on other address spaces.\n\nOS/360 defined four types of SVC routines, called \"Type 1\" through \"Type 4\"; MVS/370 added an additional \"Type 6\", which is similar to \"Type 1\" except that the SVC routine is physically disabled. \"Type 5\" was neither defined nor implemented. The following information, part of a table for OS/360, augmented for MVS/370 and successor systems, gives an idea of the considerations involved in writing an SVC routine.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" \n|-\n!

OPEN also supports datasets which are to be operated on by a \"roll your own\" access method, such as those which are accessed using [[Execute Channel Program|EXCP]].\n*An example of Type 6 is SVC 107, MODESET, which obtains no locks, but is able to change system mode and system key, in accordance with passed parameters.\n\n==Security==\nOS/360 did not, in general, have any way of restricting the use of SVCs. Consequently, there were quite a number of unintentional system- and data-integrity exposures which were possible by employing certain sequences of SVCs and other instructions. It became common practice for curious users to attempt to discover these exposures, but some system programmers used these exposures rather than develop their own user-written SVCs.\n\nBeginning with MVS/370, IBM considered it a [[product defect]] if a system design error would allow an application program to enter supervisor state without authorization. They mandated that all IBM SVCs be protected to close all system- and data-integrity exposures. They \"guaranteed\" to close such exposures as these were discovered. By Release 3.7 of MVS/370 in 1977 nearly every such exposure had indeed been identified and closed, at the cost of 100,000 Authorized Program Analysis Reports (APARs) and related [[IBM Program temporary fix|Program temporary fixes]] (PTFs). This was a remarkable achievement, as system \"up time\" was thereafter measured in ''years'', rather than in ''days'' or even in ''hours''.\n\n==Notes==\n{{Notelist}}\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Supervisor Call Instruction}}\n[[Category:IBM mainframe operating systems]]\n[[Category:System calls]]\n", "text_old": "{{multiple issues|\n{{notability|date=September 2012}}\n{{more citations needed|date=September 2012}}\n}}\n\nA '''Supervisor Call instruction''' ('''SVC''') is a hardware [[Instruction (computer science)|instruction]] in the [[System/360]] family of [[IBM mainframe]] computers up to contemporary [[zSeries]] (as well as non-IBM mainframe computers such as the [[Amdahl Corporation|Amdahl]] 470V/5, 470V/6, 470V/7, 470V/8, 580, 5880, 5990M, and 5990A, and others; Univac [[UNIVAC Series 90|90/60]], 90/70 and 90/80, and possibly others; and the Fujitsu M180 (UP), and M200 (MP), and others) used to cause an interrupt to request a service from the [[operating system]].

The court, quoting the Supreme Court case ''[[Nken v. Holder]]'', made clear that \"a stay is not a matter of right, even if irreparable injury might otherwise result.\"<ref name=9th18>''Washington v. Trump'' No. 17-35105 (9th Circ.), slip op. at 18</ref> Because of this, the court needed to answer four questions under ''Nken'', with the first two being most important: \"(1) whether the stay applicant has made a strong showing that he is likely to succeed on the merits; (2) whether the applicant will be irreparably injured absent a stay; (3) whether issuance of the stay will substantially injure the other parties interested in the proceedings; and (4) where the public interest lies.\"<ref>''Washington v. Trump'' (9th Cir.) at 18 quoting {{ussc|name=Nken v. Holder|volume=556|page=418|pin=434|year=2009}}</ref><ref name=9th18 /> The court denied the stay as they found the federal government failed to prove the first two questions, and that the last two tip in favor of the plaintiffs, Washington and Minnesota.\n\nThe court ruled that the federal government is unlikely to succeed on the merits against Washington's due process claim. Though the court discussed Washington State's contention that the executive order violates the [[First Amendment]] prohibition on religious discrimination, they withheld ruling on that claim, as being unlikely to succeed against a due process claim is sufficient to fail the first question. The federal government did not provide evidence or argument as to why the executive order needed to be enacted immediately and thus a stay required.<ref>''Washington v. Trump'' (9th Cir.) at 26-27 (\"Despite the district court's and our own repeated invitations to explain the urgent need for the Executive Order to be placed immediately into effect, the [Federal] Government submitted no evidence to rebut the States' argument that the district court's order merely returned the nation temporarily to the position it has occupied for many previous years.\")</ref> In showing the federal government was unlikely to succeed on the merits against a due process claim, the court argued that it showed the States and their citizens would be irreparably harmed by a stay as \"the deprivation of constitutional rights 'unquestionably constitutes irreparable injury.'\"<ref>''Washington v. Trump'' (9th Cir.) at 28, quoting {{ussc|name=Elrod v. Burns|volume=427|page=347|pin=373|year=1976}}</ref> The court found that \"aspects of the public interest favor both sides\", but that in light of the prior three questions, \"these competing public inteterests do not justify a stay.\"<ref>''Washington v.

The court, quoting the Supreme Court case ''[[Nken v. Holder]]'', made clear that \"a stay is not a matter of right, even if irreparable injury might otherwise result.\"<ref name=9th18>''Washington v. Trump'' No. 17-35105 (9th Circ.), slip op. at 18</ref> Because of this, the court needed to answer four questions under ''Nken'', with the first two being most important: \"(1) whether the stay applicant has made a strong showing that he is likely to succeed on the merits; (2) whether the applicant will be irreparably injured absent a stay; (3) whether issuance of the stay will substantially injure the other parties interested in the proceedings; and (4) where the public interest lies.\"<ref>''Washington v. Trump'' (9th Cir.) at 18 quoting {{ussc|name=Nken v. Holder|volume=556|page=418|pin=434|year=2009}}</ref><ref name=9th18 /> The court denied the stay as they found the federal government failed to prove the first two questions, and that the last two tip in favor of the plaintiffs, Washington and Minnesota.\n\nThe court ruled that the federal government is unlikely to succeed on the merits against Washington's due process claim. Though the court discussed Washington State's contention that the executive order violates the [[First Amendment]] prohibition on religious discrimination, they withheld ruling on that claim, as being unlikely to succeed against a due process claim is sufficient to fail the first question. The federal government did not provide evidence or argument as to why the executive order needed to be enacted immediately and thus a stay required.<ref>''Washington v. Trump'' (9th Cir.) at 26-27 (\"Despite the district court's and our own repeated invitations to explain the urgent need for the Executive Order to be placed immediately into effect, the [Federal] Government submitted no evidence to rebut the States' argument that the district court's order merely returned the nation temporarily to the position it has occupied for many previous years.\")</ref> In showing the federal government was unlikely to succeed on the merits against a due process claim, the court argued that it showed the States and their citizens would be irreparably harmed by a stay as \"the deprivation of constitutional rights 'unquestionably constitutes irreparable injury.'\"<ref>''Washington v. Trump'' (9th Cir.) at 28, quoting {{ussc|name=Elrod v. Burns|volume=427|page=347|pin=373|year=1976}}</ref> The court found that \"aspects of the public interest favor both sides\", but that in light of the prior three questions, \"these competing public inteterests do not justify a stay.\"<ref>''Washington v. Trump'' (9th Cir.) at 28-29</ref>\n\n=== ''En banc'' proceedings ===\nThe day after the denial of stay, the 9th Circuit ordered the parties to submit supplemental briefs on whether the motion should be reheard ''[[en banc]]''.<ref>[http://cdn.ca9.uscourts.gov/datastore/general/2017/02/10/17-35105_Supplemental%20Briefing%20Order.pdf Supplemental briefing order], ''Washington v.

A group of seven men, led by the aged Markus, arrive at her house intent on robbing Marlina of her livestock and raping her. They demand to be fed dinner, and she takes the opportunity to poison most of the robbers with chicken soup and decapitate Markus. She burns Markus' musical instrument, a [[jungga]].\n\nIn the second act, The Journey, she hitches a ride on the local bus where she encounters the pregnant Novi, on the way to find her jealous husband Umbu before she delivers. They are joined by an old woman with a dowry payment of two horses on the way to her nephew's wedding. Along the way, two of the other robbers (including Franz) discover the deaths and chase after Marlina. They hijack the bus, but Marlina escapes with one of the horses. Along the way, Marlina is haunted by a headless apparition playing the jungga.\n\nIn the third act, The Confession, she arrives at the local police station and delivers a report of the robbery, rape, and her self-defense. The police accept the report but insist that they can't proceed for at least a month while they wait for funds to purchase rape test equipment. Marlina bonds with a young girl in a local [[warung]].\n\nIn the fourth act, The Birth, Novi finally finds Umbu. He, believing that a [[Breech birth|breech baby]] is a sign of infidelity, hits her and leaves her to be found by Franz, who threatens her into luring Marlina back to the house. The three meet at the house, and Novi's water breaks. She considers killing Franz, but takes pity on him. Franz reunites the head of Markus with his corpse and places him beside Marlina's mummified husband. While Novi cooks chicken soup for him under duress, he rapes Marlina and Novi decapitates him. She then gives birth. Marlina and Novi leave the house in the morning together with the child.\n\n==Cast==\n* Marsha Timothy as Marlina\n* Yoga Pratama as Franz\n* Egy Fedly as Markus\n* Dea Panendra as Novi\n\n==Reception==\nOn [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds an approval rating of 98% based on 42 reviews, and an [[average rating]] of 7.81/10.

A group of seven men, led by the aged Markus, arrive at her house intent on robbing Marlina of her livestock and raping her. They demand to be fed dinner, and she takes the opportunity to poison most of the robbers with chicken soup and decapitate Markus. She burns Markus' musical instrument, a [[jungga]].\n\nIn the second act, The Journey, she hitches a ride on the local bus where she encounters the pregnant Novi, on the way to find her jealous husband Umbu before she delivers. They are joined by an old woman with a dowry payment of two horses on the way to her nephew's wedding. Along the way, two of the other robbers (including Franz) discover the deaths and chase after Marlina. They hijack the bus, but Marlina escapes with one of the horses. Along the way, Marlina is haunted by a headless apparition playing the jungga.\n\nIn the third act, The Confession, she arrives at the local police station and delivers a report of the robbery, rape, and her self-defense. The police accept the report but insist that they can't proceed for at least a month while they wait for funds to purchase rape test equipment. Marlina bonds with a young girl in a local [[warung]].\n\nIn the fourth act, The Birth, Novi finally finds Umbu. He, believing that a [[Breech birth|breech baby]] is a sign of infidelity, hits her and leaves her to be found by Franz, who threatens her into luring Marlina back to the house. The three meet at the house, and Novi's water breaks. She considers killing Franz, but takes pity on him. Franz reunites the head of Markus with his corpse and places him beside Marlina's mummified husband. While Novi cooks chicken soup for him under duress, he rapes Marlina and Novi decapitates him. She then gives birth. Marlina and Novi leave the house in the morning together with the child.\n\n==Cast==\n* Marsha Timothy as Marlina\n* Yoga Pratama as Franz\n* Egy Fedly as Markus\n* Dea Panendra as Novi\n\n==Reception==\nOn [[review aggregator]] website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds an approval rating of 98% based on 42 reviews, and an [[average rating]] of 7.81/10.

We are committed to ensuring that all individuals affected by the executive orders, including those affected by the court orders, are being provided all rights afforded under the law.  We are also working closely with airline partners to prevent travelers who would not be granted entry under the executive orders from boarding international flights to the U.S. Therefore, we do not anticipate that further individuals traveling by air to the United States will be affected. As Secretary Kelly previously stated, in applying the provisions of the president's executive order, the entry of lawful permanent residents is in the national interest. Accordingly, absent significant derogatory information indicating a serious threat to public safety and welfare, lawful permanent resident status will be a dispositive factor in our case-by-case determinations.

Similarly, the majority of the court rejected challenges to \u00a71152(a)(1)(A) which bars discrimination on basis of nationality. According to Roberts, \u00a71182(f) defines the universe of non citizens and within that universe, \u00a71152(a)(1)(A) prohibits discrimination on basis of nationality. Lastly, the Court rejected Hawaii's challenge to the Constitution's establishment clause which prohibits favoring one religion over another. Roberts pointed out that even though five of the seven nations are Muslim Majority, by that fact alone \"does not support an inference of religious hostility, given that the policy covers just 8% of the world\u2019s Muslim population and is limited to countries that were previously designated by Congress or prior administrations as posing national security risks.\" Additionally, three Muslim Majority countries have since been dropped from the [[Executive Order 13769|original Travel Ban]] of January 2017. Additionally, there are waiver exemptions such as medical that people from banned nations are eligible for.

We are committed to ensuring that all individuals affected by the executive orders, including those affected by the court orders, are being provided all rights afforded under the law.  We are also working closely with airline partners to prevent travelers who would not be granted entry under the executive orders from boarding international flights to the U.S. Therefore, we do not anticipate that further individuals traveling by air to the United States will be affected. As Secretary Kelly previously stated, in applying the provisions of the president's executive order, the entry of lawful permanent residents is in the national interest. Accordingly, absent significant derogatory information indicating a serious threat to public safety and welfare, lawful permanent resident status will be a dispositive factor in our case-by-case determinations.

Similarly, the majority of the court rejected challenges to \u00a71152(a)(1)(A) which bars discrimination on basis of nationality. According to Roberts, \u00a71182(f) defines the universe of non citizens and within that universe, \u00a71152(a)(1)(A) prohibits discrimination on basis of nationality. Lastly, the Court rejected Hawaii's challenge to the Constitution's establishment clause which prohibits favoring one religion over another. Roberts pointed out that even though five of the seven nations are Muslim Majority, by that fact alone \"does not support an inference of religious hostility, given that the policy covers just 8% of the world\u2019s Muslim population and is limited to countries that were previously designated by Congress or prior administrations as posing national security risks.\" Additionally, three Muslim Majority countries have since been dropped from the [[Executive Order 13769|original Travel Ban]] of January 2017. Additionally, there are waiver exemptions such as medical that people from banned nations are eligible for.
