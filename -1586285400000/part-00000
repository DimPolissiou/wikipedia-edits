It is supported on the [[iPhone]], [[Apple Watch]], [[iPad]], and [[Macintosh|Mac]]. It digitizes and can replace a [[credit card|credit]] or [[debit card|debit]] card [[chip and PIN]] transaction at a contactless-capable [[point-of-sale terminal]]. Apple Pay does not require Apple Pay-specific [[contactless payment]] terminals; it works with any merchant that accepts contactless payments.<ref name=\"pocket-lint.com\">{{cite web|url=https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207957|title=Countries and regions that support Apple Pay|last=|first=|last2=|first2=|date=July 17, 2019|publisher=[[Apple Inc.|Apple]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=|df=mdy-all}}</ref> It is similar to contactless payments, with the addition of [[two-factor authentication]] via Touch ID, [[Face ID]], PIN, or passcode. Devices wirelessly communicate with point of sale systems using [[near field communication]] (NFC), with an embedded secure element (eSE) to securely store payment data and perform cryptographic functions, and Apple's [[Touch ID]] and [[Face ID]] for biometric authentication.\n\nOriginally launching in the United States, Apple Pay is available in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]], [[Brazil]], the [[United Arab Emirates]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Russia]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[China]], [[New Zealand]], [[Singapore]], [[Japan]], [[Taiwan]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Macau]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Belarus]], [[Montenegro]] and all countries in the [[European Economic Area|European Economic Area (EEA)]].<ref name=\"pocket-lint.com\" /> Apple Pay supports both international payment schemes\u2014such as [[American Express]], [[Visa Inc.|Visa]] (including [[Visa Electron|Electron]] and [[V Pay]]), [[Mastercard]] (including [[Maestro (debit card)|Maestro]]), and [[Discover Card|Discover]]\u2014as well as country-specific domestic payment schemes like China's [[UnionPay]], Japan's [[JCB Co., Ltd.|JCB]], France's [[Groupement des Cartes Bancaires CB|Cartes Bancaires]], Australia's [[eftpos]] and Saudi Arabia's [[Saudi Payments Network|mada]].

The use of CDCVM allows for the device itself to provide verification for the transaction and may not let the cardholder to sign a receipt or enter their PIN. Additionally, in certain markets which have a 'no verification contactless limit' using contactless cards (such as the \u00a330 limit in the United Kingdom and the C$100 limit in Canada), the use of CDCVM can enable merchants to accept transactions higher than these amounts using Apple Pay, providing their terminal software is updated to support the latest network contactless specifications.<ref>{{Cite news |url= https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202527 |title= Consumer Device Cardholder Verification Method |publisher=[[Apple Inc.|Apple]] |access-date= 2016-12-01 |df= mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n=== Express Transit or Express Travel ===\nSince iOS 12.3, supported credit and debit cards, as well as some [[stored-value card|stored-value transport cards]] (such as Shanghai & Beijing transit cards, [[Suica]], [[Metropolitan Transportation Authority|MTA]] and [[TriMet]]) can be used to pay for journeys on certain public transport networks without requiring the user to authenticate the payment with [[Touch ID]] or [[Face ID]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT209495|title=Use Express Transit with Apple Pay|publisher=[[Apple Inc.|Apple]] Support|access-date=2019-07-18}}</ref> Once a supported credit, debit or transit card is selected as a user's Express Transit/Travel card, the user can simply hold their device near the card reader, for example at ticket barriers, to initiate or complete payment for the journey.\n\nWithin iOS, the functionality is labelled as \"Express Transit\" in North America and \"Express Travel\" in most other English-speaking countries, because \"transit\" in most varieties of English has a narrower meaning of travelling through a jurisdiction or airport during a journey as opposed to travel or transport in general.\n\nOn iPhone XR, iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max and later, Express Transit/Travel cards can be used up to five hours on Power Reserve after the device has powered off due to a drained battery. The typical low-battery icon will display with \"Express Cards Available\" text appearing at the bottom of the display, letting users know that Express Transit/Travel is still available for usage.\n\nExpress mode is also available for contactless student ID cards stored in the Wallet app.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208965|title=Use student ID cards in Wallet on your iPhone or Apple Watch|publisher=[[Apple Inc.|Apple]] Support|access-date=2019-07-18}}</ref>\n\n=== Global acceptance ===\nApple Pay implements the Contactless [[EMV]] standards from the major payment card networks and should work at any merchant that supports contactless payments worldwide, regardless if they specifically advertise Apple Pay acceptance or if Apple Pay support is offered by card issuers in that country. However, due to provisioning differences between countries (and even between issuers), users may encounter acceptance issues when travelling to a different country. Some known issues include:\n* Canada, UK, and possibly other non-US-issued VISA cards only support EMV-mode transactions and not legacy magnetic stripe data emulation transactions. Some contactless terminals in the US do not support EMV-mode contactless transactions (even if they support EMV contact transactions), and therefore these visitors to the US will receive a 'Could Not Complete Payment' error on the iPhone screen and an error on the terminal when attempting to use Apple Pay.\n\n=== Apple Cash ===\n'''Apple Cash''', formerly '''Apple Pay Cash''', is a feature that allows the transfer of money from one user to another via [[iMessage]]. When a user receives a payment, the funds are deposited in the recipient's Apple Cash card, where it is available for immediate use at merchants that accept Discover. Alternatively, the user can choose to transfer the balance to a nominated bank account via [[wire transfer]]. Apple Cash is only available in the [[United States]].<ref>{{Cite news |url= https://www.macworld.com/article/3236545/ios/apple-pay-cash-guide-what-it-is-how-it-works-and-what-it-costs.html |title= Apple Pay Cash guide: What it is, how it works, and what it costs |work=[[Macworld]] |access-date= 2018-08-05 |df= mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url= https://www.forbes.com/sites/amitchowdhry/2017/12/19/how-to-use-apple-pay-cash/ |title= How To Use Apple Pay Cash |last= Chowdhry |first= Amit |work=[[Forbes]] |access-date= 2018-08-05 |df= mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n=== 2013 ===\nThe service was in preparation for \"a long time\", as Apple acquired startups, hired executives and filed patents related to payments.<ref name=\"The Verge: allows you\" /> Apple partnered with American Express, [[MasterCard]] and Visa. Their joint project began in January 2013, though they had discussed Apple's potential involvement for years. Their joint solution was a system where single-use digital tokens would replace the transfer of personal information.<ref name=\"NYT: Apple's Way\" /> A Visa executive said that 750 people at the company worked on the anonymized \"token\" system for a year, and the other partners had similar teams in collaboration.<ref name=\"The Verge: most revolutionary\" /> MasterCard began work on the project in 2013 and hoped that their joint work would become a \"standard for mobile payments\".<ref name=\"The Verge: most revolutionary\" /> The announcement of the service came at a time when MasterCard and Visa policy created strong incentives for upgrading to mobile payment-compatible point of sale systems.<ref name=\"The Verge: allows you\" /> Apple then approached several big banks in mid 2013 and did not divulge the names of the other banks. To maintain secrecy, JPMorgan set up a windowless \"war room\" where the majority of the sensitive work was done. Of their 300 people on the project, about 100 knew that the partner was Apple. Others close to the project did not know it was named \"Apple Pay\" until the announcement.

[[Softcard]].<ref name=\"The Verge: most revolutionary\"/> They noted that previous efforts did not solve customer inconvenience issues, and felt that Apple Pay potentially did.<ref name=\"The Verge: allows you\"/> ''[[The Verge]]''{{'s}} Adrianne Jeffries noted that mobile payment market fragmentation was partially due to Apple's refusal to enter the market. [[Bloomberg Businessweek|''BusinessWeek'']]'s Joshua Brustein added that Apple has a history of letting \"first movers fail\" with an early version of the service before releasing \"a more polished version of the same idea\".<ref name=\"The Verge: allows you\"/> ''The Verge''{{'s}} Dieter Bohn called Apple Pay the \"week's most revolutionary product\" and the announcement \"a classic Apple moment of simplification and integration\", and the partnership between payments services and Apple \"a rare piece of collaboration and agreement\". He predicted that the service's effect on the mobile payments industry would be similar to the [[iPhone]]'s effect on the [[smartphone]] industry.<ref name=\"The Verge: most revolutionary\"/> Nathaniel Popper of ''[[The New York Times]]'' referred to the banks' level of coordination with Apple as \"elaborate\" and indicative of mutual \"preparation and investment\".<ref name=\"NYT: Apple's Way\"/> Some analysts added that the service could reduce the standard credit card transaction fees over time, since fees traditionally cover [[credit card fraud]]. The banks were willing to work with Apple in the face of efforts like [[Bitcoin]] and the [[Merchant Customer Exchange]], which seeks to work around the card networks.<ref name=\"NYT: Apple's Way\"/>\n\nEarly reviews of the service regarded it as easy to use, but were not sure whether the service would become widely adopted.<ref name=\"The Verge: hands\"/><ref name=\"NYT: problem\"/> ''The Verge''{{'s}} [[Nilay Patel]] wrote that the product demo was \"remarkably smooth\" and \"a cohesive user experience\".<ref name=\"The Verge: hands\"/> Patel said the process took five to ten seconds at a retail card reader, and added that it may be less smooth at stores such as Walgreens, where cashiers prompt customers for loyalty cards and charity donations.<ref name=\"The Verge: hands\"/> ''The New York Times''{{'}} Neil Irwin wrote that Apple exaggerated the inconvenience of credit cards.

It is supported on the [[iPhone]], [[Apple Watch]], [[iPad]], and [[Macintosh|Mac]]. It digitizes and can replace a [[credit card|credit]] or [[debit card|debit]] card [[chip and PIN]] transaction at a contactless-capable [[point-of-sale terminal]]. Apple Pay does not require Apple Pay-specific [[contactless payment]] terminals; it works with any merchant that accepts contactless payments.<ref name=\"pocket-lint.com\">{{cite web|url=https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT207957|title=Countries and regions that support Apple Pay|last=|first=|last2=|first2=|date=July 17, 2019|publisher=[[Apple Inc.|Apple]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=|df=mdy-all}}</ref> It is similar to contactless payments, with the addition of [[two-factor authentication]] via Touch ID, [[Face ID]], PIN, or passcode. Devices wirelessly communicate with point of sale systems using [[near field communication]] (NFC), with an embedded secure element (eSE) to securely store payment data and perform cryptographic functions, and Apple's [[Touch ID]] and [[Face ID]] for biometric authentication.\n\nOriginally launching in the United States, Apple Pay is available in the [[United Kingdom]], [[Canada]], [[Australia]], [[Brazil]], the [[United Arab Emirates]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Russia]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[China]], [[New Zealand]], [[Singapore]], [[Japan]], [[Taiwan]], [[Hong Kong]], [[Macau]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Belarus]], [[Montenegro]] and all countries in the [[European Economic Area|European Economic Area (EEA)]].<ref name=\"pocket-lint.com\" /> Apple Pay supports both international payment schemes\u2014such as [[American Express]], [[Visa Inc.|Visa]] (including [[Visa Electron|Electron]] and [[V Pay]]), [[Mastercard]] (including [[Maestro (debit card)|Maestro]]), and [[Discover Card|Discover]]\u2014as well as country-specific domestic payment schemes like China's [[UnionPay]], Japan's [[JCB Co., Ltd.|JCB]], France's [[Groupement des Cartes Bancaires CB|Cartes Bancaires]], Australia's [[eftpos]] and Saudi Arabia's [[Saudi Payments Network|mada]].

The use of CDCVM allows for the device itself to provide verification for the transaction and may not let the cardholder to sign a receipt or enter their PIN. Additionally, in certain markets which have a 'no verification contactless limit' using contactless cards (such as the \u00a330 limit in the United Kingdom and the C$100 limit in Canada), the use of CDCVM can enable merchants to accept transactions higher than these amounts using Apple Pay, providing their terminal software is updated to support the latest network contactless specifications.<ref>{{Cite news |url= https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT202527 |title= Consumer Device Cardholder Verification Method |publisher=[[Apple Inc.|Apple]] |access-date= 2016-12-01 |df= mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n=== Express Transit or Express Travel ===\nSince iOS 12.3, supported credit and debit cards, as well as some [[stored-value card|stored-value transport cards]] (such as Shanghai & Beijing transit cards, [[Suica]], [[Metropolitan Transportation Authority|MTA]] and [[TriMet]]) can be used to pay for journeys on certain public transport networks without requiring the user to authenticate the payment with [[Touch ID]] or [[Face ID]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT209495|title=Use Express Transit with Apple Pay|publisher=[[Apple Inc.|Apple]] Support|access-date=2019-07-18}}</ref> Once a supported credit, debit or transit card is selected as a user's Express Transit/Travel card, the user can simply hold their device near the card reader, for example at ticket barriers, to initiate or complete payment for the journey.\n\nWithin iOS, the functionality is labelled as \"Express Transit\" in North America and \"Express Travel\" in most other English-speaking countries, because \"transit\" in most varieties of English has a narrower meaning of travelling through a jurisdiction or airport during a journey as opposed to travel or transport in general.\n\nOn iPhone XR, iPhone XS, iPhone XS Max and later, Express Transit/Travel cards can be used up to five hours on Power Reserve after the device has powered off due to a drained battery. The typical low-battery icon will display with \"Express Cards Available\" text appearing at the bottom of the display, letting users know that Express Transit/Travel is still available for usage.\n\nExpress mode is also available for contactless student ID cards stored in the Wallet app.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208965|title=Use student ID cards in Wallet on your iPhone or Apple Watch|publisher=[[Apple Inc.|Apple]] Support|access-date=2019-07-18}}</ref>\n\n=== Global acceptance ===\nApple Pay implements the Contactless [[EMV]] standards from the major payment card networks and should work at any merchant that supports contactless payments worldwide, regardless if they specifically advertise Apple Pay acceptance or if Apple Pay support is offered by card issuers in that country. However, due to provisioning differences between countries (and even between issuers), users may encounter acceptance issues when travelling to a different country. Some known issues include:\n* Canada, UK, and possibly other non-US-issued VISA cards only support EMV-mode transactions and not legacy magnetic stripe data emulation transactions. Some contactless terminals in the US do not support EMV-mode contactless transactions (even if they support EMV contact transactions), and therefore these visitors to the US will receive a 'Could Not Complete Payment' error on the iPhone screen and an error on the terminal when attempting to use Apple Pay.\n\n=== Apple Cash ===\n'''Apple Cash''', formerly '''Apple Pay Cash''', is a feature that allows the transfer of money from one user to another via [[iMessage]]. When a user receives a payment, the funds are deposited in the recipient's Apple Cash card, where it is available for immediate use at merchants that accept Discover. Alternatively, the user can choose to transfer the balance to a nominated bank account via [[wire transfer]]. Apple Cash is only available in the [[United States]].<ref>{{Cite news |url= https://www.macworld.com/article/3236545/ios/apple-pay-cash-guide-what-it-is-how-it-works-and-what-it-costs.html |title= Apple Pay Cash guide: What it is, how it works, and what it costs |work=[[Macworld]] |access-date= 2018-08-05 |df= mdy-all}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url= https://www.forbes.com/sites/amitchowdhry/2017/12/19/how-to-use-apple-pay-cash/ |title= How To Use Apple Pay Cash |last= Chowdhry |first= Amit |work=[[Forbes]] |access-date= 2018-08-05 |df= mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n=== 2013 ===\nThe service was in preparation for \"a long time\", as Apple acquired startups, hired executives and filed patents related to payments.<ref name=\"The Verge: allows you\" /> Apple partnered with American Express, [[MasterCard]] and Visa. Their joint project began in January 2013, though they had discussed Apple's potential involvement for years. Their joint solution was a system where single-use digital tokens would replace the transfer of personal information.<ref name=\"NYT: Apple's Way\" /> A Visa executive said that 750 people at the company worked on the anonymized \"token\" system for a year, and the other partners had similar teams in collaboration.<ref name=\"The Verge: most revolutionary\" /> MasterCard began work on the project in 2013 and hoped that their joint work would become a \"standard for mobile payments\".<ref name=\"The Verge: most revolutionary\" /> The announcement of the service came at a time when MasterCard and Visa policy created strong incentives for upgrading to mobile payment-compatible point of sale systems.<ref name=\"The Verge: allows you\" /> Apple then approached several big banks in mid 2013 and did not divulge the names of the other banks.

[[Softcard]].<ref name=\"The Verge: most revolutionary\"/> They noted that previous efforts did not solve customer inconvenience issues, and felt that Apple Pay potentially did.<ref name=\"The Verge: allows you\"/> ''[[The Verge]]''{{'s}} Adrianne Jeffries noted that mobile payment market fragmentation was partially due to Apple's refusal to enter the market. [[Bloomberg Businessweek|''BusinessWeek'']]'s Joshua Brustein added that Apple has a history of letting \"first movers fail\" with an early version of the service before releasing \"a more polished version of the same idea\".<ref name=\"The Verge: allows you\"/> ''The Verge''{{'s}} Dieter Bohn called Apple Pay the \"week's most revolutionary product\" and the announcement \"a classic Apple moment of simplification and integration\", and the partnership between payments services and Apple \"a rare piece of collaboration and agreement\". He predicted that the service's effect on the mobile payments industry would be similar to the [[iPhone]]'s effect on the [[smartphone]] industry.<ref name=\"The Verge: most revolutionary\"/> Nathaniel Popper of ''[[The New York Times]]'' referred to the banks' level of coordination with Apple as \"elaborate\" and indicative of mutual \"preparation and investment\".<ref name=\"NYT: Apple's Way\"/> Some analysts added that the service could reduce the standard credit card transaction fees over time, since fees traditionally cover [[credit card fraud]]. The banks were willing to work with Apple in the face of efforts like [[Bitcoin]] and the [[Merchant Customer Exchange]], which seeks to work around the card networks.<ref name=\"NYT: Apple's Way\"/>\n\nEarly reviews of the service regarded it as easy to use, but were not sure whether the service would become widely adopted.<ref name=\"The Verge: hands\"/><ref name=\"NYT: problem\"/> ''The Verge''{{'s}} [[Nilay Patel]] wrote that the product demo was \"remarkably smooth\" and \"a cohesive user experience\".<ref name=\"The Verge: hands\"/> Patel said the process took five to ten seconds at a retail card reader, and added that it may be less smooth at stores such as Walgreens, where cashiers prompt customers for loyalty cards and charity donations.<ref name=\"The Verge: hands\"/> ''The New York Times''{{'}} Neil Irwin wrote that Apple exaggerated the inconvenience of credit cards.
