The airport is named after [[Tribhuvan of Nepal|Tribhuvan Bir Bikram Shah]], the king of Nepal from 11 December 1911 to 13 March 1955. The airport is a sole international airport in Nepal, operating with a single runway, one domestic and an international terminal. TIA connects Nepal to more than 40 destinations in 17 countries. \n\nThe airport is a hub for two international airlines, [[Himalaya Airlines]] and the flag carrier, [[Nepal Airlines]]. Seasonally, [[Buddha Air]] also offers scheduled international flights to nearby Indian cities. About seventeen [[List of aircraft registration prefixes|9N-]] registered [[List of airlines of Nepal|domestic air operators]] maintain Kathmandu as their principal base of operation.<ref name=\"Report 2017\" /> The airport is considered as a starting point to [[Mount Everest]], with the several daily flights to [[Tenzing\u2013Hillary Airport|Lukla]]. A few airlines also offer Everest sightseeing flights out of Kathmandu. \n\nDue to severe traffic congestion and the airport running out of its maximum capacity, the government of Nepal has decided to perform a short-term expansion and construct more international airports, notably, [[Nijgadh International Airport]]. \n \nAs a result of the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]], [[ Nepal Government]] has suspended all international flights until 30 April 2020 and domestic flights until 15 April 2020. \n==History==\nThe airport site was a place where shepherds took their cattle to graze. The formal beginning of aviation in Nepal occurred in 1949, when a [[Beechcraft Bonanza]] carrying the Indian ambassador landed at Kathmandu Airport. The airport was originally referred as '''Gauchaur Airport.''' In Nepali, 'Gauchaur' refers to a place where cows graze.\n\nOn 20 February 1949, an Indian registered [[Douglas DC-3|Dakota DC-3]] commenced the first ever scheduled service, linking Kathmandu to [[Patna]], Calcutta (now: [[Kolkata]]) and [[Delhi]]. \n\nIn 1950, [[Tribhuvan of Nepal|King Tribhuvan]] gave an explicit support to [[Nepal Praja Parishad]] to overthrow the [[Rana dynasty]], and took a refuge at the Indian embassy. [[Gyanendra Bir Bikram Shah]], the four-year-old grandson of Tribhuvan was crowned a new king at the [[Hanuman Dhoka]]. On 10 November 1950, two Indian planes landed at Gauchaur Airport and carried the young king along with his grandfather Tribhuvan, to Delhi. After the [[Delhi Accord]], the Rana regime ended and King Tribhuvan landed at Gauchaur Airport as a [[Monarch]] as well as the [[Head of state]] on 18 February 1951, bringing the waves of democracy in Nepal. \n\nIn 1952, the scheduled domestic flights commenced to [[Gautam Buddha Airport|Bhairahawa]], [[Biratnagar Airport|Biratnagar]], [[Pokhara Airport|Pokhara]] and [[Simara Airport|Simara]]. \n\nOn 15 June 1955, the airport was officially inaugurated by [[Mahendra of Nepal|King Mahendra Bir Bikram Shah]]. The king renamed the airport as '''Tribhuvan Airport''' in the memory of his father. The airport was again renamed as '''Tribhuvan International Airport''' in 1964.\n\nIn 1957, the original grass runway 16/34 was re-laid in concrete. In 1964, the runway of {{convert|3700|ft|m|abbr=}}, was abandoned for newer {{convert|6600|ft|m}} runway 02/20. The runway was again extended from {{convert|6600|ft|m}} to {{convert|10000|ft|m}} with the joint effort of the [[Asian Development Bank]] (ADB) and the [[OPEC]] in 1975.<ref name=\"CAA Nepal\">{{cite web|url=http://www.caanepal.org.np/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=60&Itemid=38|title=Chronology|author=Administrator|publisher=|accessdate=3 January 2015}}</ref> The old runway 16/34 is now the Taxiway B. \n\nThe first jet aircraft to land at Tribhuvan was a [[Lufthansa]] [[Boeing 707]] in 1967.<ref name=\"CAA Nepal\" /> [[Nepal Airlines|Royal Nepal Airlines Corporation]] commenced jet operations at the airport in 1972 with [[Boeing 727]] aircraft.<ref name=\"CAA Nepal\" />\n\nIn May 2007, [[Austrian Airlines]] discontinued its flight to [[Vienna Airport|Vienna]], Nepal's last direct air link to Europe.<ref>\n \"Austrian bids farewell to the 737\", Airliner World, June 2013: p6</ref> In September 2013, [[Turkish Airlines]] launched direct flights from [[Istanbul]] to Kathmandu, re-establishing Nepal's connection with continental Europe.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.turkishairlines.com/en-int/flights-tickets/flights-destinations?departure=istanbul&continent=all&class=economy|title=International Flight Destinations & Special Offers \u2013 Turkish Airlines|author=Medyasoft (c) 2012|publisher=|accessdate=3 January 2015}}</ref>\n\n== Facilities ==\n\n=== Apron ===\nThe international apron at TIA can handle up to 9 aircraft, although only three can support [[Wide-body aircraft|wide-body]] category aircraft. There is also a bay at the eastern side of the airport that can hold two wide-body and two [[ATR 72]] or similar type of aircraft. The eastern bay is used solely to park disabled or non-operational airplanes. Two new international aprons are under-construction to the south of the existing aprons. \n\nThe aprons at the domestic terminal has been accommodating up to 35 aircraft, despite its allowable capacity of only 17.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kathmandupost.com/money/2017/11/19/poor-airport-infra-to-put-brakes-on-fleet-expansion|title=Poor airport infra to put brakes on fleet expansion|website=kathmandupost.com|language=English|access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref> The helipad at TIA can handle up to 17 helicopters. \n\n=== Runway === \nThe airport has a single {{convert|10,007|ft|m}} runway with a slope of 1.2% oriented at 02/20. The [[Asphalt|bitumen]] runway with the strength of [[Pavement classification number|PCN]] 54F/A/W/T has the markings of the centerline, edge, touchdown zone and the threshold. The runway is equipped with the high intensity centerline lights, bidirectional raised edge lights, the threshold lights and the runway end lights. [[Precision approach path indicator]] (PAPI) lights (3\u00b0) are installed as landing aids for the both runways 02/20. The runway has five intersections with the taxiways. The taxiway G runs parallel to the runway but it doesn't connect the thresholds.\n\n=== Aids to Navigation ===\nThere are two [[non-precision approach]] available at the Kathmandu Airport; VHF omnidirectional range along a distance measuring equipment ([[VOR/DME]]) and [[Area navigation|Random Area Navigation]] (RNAV/RNP). A high intensity {{Convert|870|m|ft|abbr=}} extended centerline lights are installed at the southern end of the airport to assist with the approach.\n\n=== Terminals ===\nThe airport has two public terminals, one for international and one for domestic traffic. It also has a terminal for VIP guests operated by the [[Government of Nepal]], where international state guests are welcomed. There are plans to construct a separate terminal for [[helicopter|helicopter transportation]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Separate helicopter terminal to be built at TIA |url=https://www.aviationnepal.com/separate-helicopter-terminal-to-be-built-at-tia/ |publisher=Aviation Nepal |accessdate=31 January 2019 |date=20 December 2018}}</ref>\n\n[[Radisson Hotels|Radisson Hotel Kathmandu]] operates an executive lounge for first and business class passengers for some airlines<ref>{{cite web|title=Airport Restaurant and Executive Lounge|url=https://www.radisson.com/rad/images/hotels/NEPKATHM/airport%20restaurant.pdf|publisher=Radisson|accessdate=1 April 2018}}</ref> and [[Thai Airways]] operates a lounge for its business-class passengers, as well as [[Star Alliance]] Gold card holders.<ref>{{cite web|title=Royal Orchid Lounge|url=https://www.thaiairways.com/en/exp_thai/Airport_Services/royal_orchid_lounges.page|publisher=Thai Airways|accessdate=1 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== Hangar ===\nNepal Airlines operates a large hangar between the international and domestic terminals.

The airport is named after [[Tribhuvan of Nepal|Tribhuvan Bir Bikram Shah]], the king of Nepal from 11 December 1911 to 13 March 1955. The airport is a sole international airport in Nepal, operating with a single runway, one domestic and an international terminal. TIA connects Nepal to more than 40 destinations in 17 countries. \n\nThe airport is a hub for two international airlines, [[Himalaya Airlines]] and the flag carrier, [[Nepal Airlines]]. Seasonally, [[Buddha Air]] also offers scheduled international flights to nearby Indian cities. About seventeen [[List of aircraft registration prefixes|9N-]] registered [[List of airlines of Nepal|domestic air operators]] maintain Kathmandu as their principal base of operation.<ref name=\"Report 2017\" /> The airport is considered as a starting point to [[Mount Everest]], with the several daily flights to [[Tenzing\u2013Hillary Airport|Lukla]]. A few airlines also offer Everest sightseeing flights out of Kathmandu. \n\nDue to severe traffic congestion and the airport running out of its maximum capacity, the government of Nepal has decided to perform a short-term expansion and construct more international airports, notably, [[Nijgadh International Airport]]. \n \nAs a result of the [[2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic]], [[ Nepal Government]] has suspended all international flights until 30 April 2020 and domestic flights until 15 April 2020. \n==History==\nThe airport site was a place where shepherds took their cattle to graze. The formal beginning of aviation in Nepal occurred in 1949, when a [[Beechcraft Bonanza]] carrying the Indian ambassador landed at Kathmandu Airport. The airport was originally referred as '''Gauchaur Airport.''' In Nepali, 'Gauchaur' refers to a place where cows graze.\n\nOn 20 February 1949, an Indian registered [[Douglas DC-3|Dakota DC-3]] commenced the first ever scheduled service, linking Kathmandu to [[Patna]], Calcutta (now: [[Kolkata]]) and [[Delhi]]. \n\nIn 1950, [[Tribhuvan of Nepal|King Tribhuvan]] gave an explicit support to [[Nepal Praja Parishad]] to overthrow the [[Rana dynasty]], and took a refuge at the Indian embassy. [[Gyanendra Bir Bikram Shah]], the four-year-old grandson of Tribhuvan was crowned a new king at the [[Hanuman Dhoka]]. On 10 November 1950, two Indian planes landed at Gauchaur Airport and carried the young king along with his grandfather Tribhuvan, to Delhi. After the [[Delhi Accord]], the Rana regime ended and King Tribhuvan landed at Gauchaur Airport as a [[Monarch]] as well as the [[Head of state]] on 18 February 1951, bringing the waves of democracy in Nepal. \n\nIn 1952, the scheduled domestic flights commenced to [[Gautam Buddha Airport|Bhairahawa]], [[Biratnagar Airport|Biratnagar]], [[Pokhara Airport|Pokhara]] and [[Simara Airport|Simara]]. \n\nOn 15 June 1955, the airport was officially inaugurated by [[Mahendra of Nepal|King Mahendra Bir Bikram Shah]]. The king renamed the airport as '''Tribhuvan Airport''' in the memory of his father. The airport was again renamed as '''Tribhuvan International Airport''' in 1964.\n\nIn 1957, the original grass runway 16/34 was re-laid in concrete. In 1964, the runway of {{convert|3700|ft|m|abbr=}}, was abandoned for newer {{convert|6600|ft|m}} runway 02/20. The runway was again extended from {{convert|6600|ft|m}} to {{convert|10000|ft|m}} with the joint effort of the [[Asian Development Bank]] (ADB) and the [[OPEC]] in 1975.<ref name=\"CAA Nepal\">{{cite web|url=http://www.caanepal.org.np/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=60&Itemid=38|title=Chronology|author=Administrator|publisher=|accessdate=3 January 2015}}</ref> The old runway 16/34 is now the Taxiway B. \n\nThe first jet aircraft to land at Tribhuvan was a [[Lufthansa]] [[Boeing 707]] in 1967.<ref name=\"CAA Nepal\" /> [[Nepal Airlines|Royal Nepal Airlines Corporation]] commenced jet operations at the airport in 1972 with [[Boeing 727]] aircraft.<ref name=\"CAA Nepal\" />\n\nIn May 2007, [[Austrian Airlines]] discontinued its flight to [[Vienna Airport|Vienna]], Nepal's last direct air link to Europe.<ref>\n \"Austrian bids farewell to the 737\", Airliner World, June 2013: p6</ref> In September 2013, [[Turkish Airlines]] launched direct flights from [[Istanbul]] to Kathmandu, re-establishing Nepal's connection with continental Europe.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.turkishairlines.com/en-int/flights-tickets/flights-destinations?departure=istanbul&continent=all&class=economy|title=International Flight Destinations & Special Offers \u2013 Turkish Airlines|author=Medyasoft (c) 2012|publisher=|accessdate=3 January 2015}}</ref>\n\n== Facilities ==\n\n=== Apron ===\nThe international apron at TIA can handle up to 9 aircrafts, although only three can support [[Wide-body aircraft|wide-body]] category aircrafts. There is also a bay at the eastern side of the airport that can hold two wide-body and two [[ATR 72]] or similar type of aircrafts. The eastern bay is used solely to park disabled or non-operational airplanes. Two new international aprons are under-construction to the south of the existing aprons. \n\nThe aprons at the domestic terminal has been accommodating up to 35 aircrafts, despite its allowable capacity of only 17.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://kathmandupost.com/money/2017/11/19/poor-airport-infra-to-put-brakes-on-fleet-expansion|title=Poor airport infra to put brakes on fleet expansion|website=kathmandupost.com|language=English|access-date=2020-04-11}}</ref> The helipad at TIA can handle up to 17 helicopters. \n\n=== Runway === \nThe airport has a single {{convert|10,007|ft|m}} runway with a slope of 1.2% oriented at 02/20. The [[Asphalt|bitumen]] runway with the strength of [[Pavement classification number|PCN]] 54F/A/W/T has the markings of the centerline, edge, touchdown zone and the threshold. The runway is equipped with the high intensity centerline lights, bidirectional raised edge lights, the threshold lights and the runway end lights. [[Precision approach path indicator]] (PAPI) lights (3\u00b0) are installed as landing aids for the both runways 02/20. The runway has five intersections with the taxiways. The taxiway G runs parallel to the runway but it doesn't connect the thresholds.\n\n=== Aids to Navigation ===\nThere are two [[non-precision approach]] available at the Kathmandu Airport; VHF omnidirectional range along a distance measuring equipment ([[VOR/DME]]) and [[Area navigation|Random Area Navigation]] (RNAV/RNP). A high intensity {{Convert|870|m|ft|abbr=}} extended centerline lights are installed at the southern end of the airport to assist with the approach.\n\n=== Terminals ===\nThe airport has two public terminals, one for international and one for domestic traffic. It also has a terminal for VIP guests operated by the [[Government of Nepal]], where international state guests are welcomed. There are plans to construct a separate terminal for [[helicopter|helicopter transportation]].<ref>{{cite web |title=Separate helicopter terminal to be built at TIA |url=https://www.aviationnepal.com/separate-helicopter-terminal-to-be-built-at-tia/ |publisher=Aviation Nepal |accessdate=31 January 2019 |date=20 December 2018}}</ref>\n\n[[Radisson Hotels|Radisson Hotel Kathmandu]] operates an executive lounge for first and business class passengers for some airlines<ref>{{cite web|title=Airport Restaurant and Executive Lounge|url=https://www.radisson.com/rad/images/hotels/NEPKATHM/airport%20restaurant.pdf|publisher=Radisson|accessdate=1 April 2018}}</ref> and [[Thai Airways]] operates a lounge for its business-class passengers, as well as [[Star Alliance]] Gold card holders.<ref>{{cite web|title=Royal Orchid Lounge|url=https://www.thaiairways.com/en/exp_thai/Airport_Services/royal_orchid_lounges.page|publisher=Thai Airways|accessdate=1 April 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== Hangar ===\nNepal Airlines operates a large hangar between the international and domestic terminals.

{"title_page": "System F", "text_new": "{{short description|Typed lambda calculus}}\n{{For|the electronic trance music artist|Ferry Corsten}}\n'''System F''', also known as the ('''Girard\u2013Reynolds''') '''polymorphic lambda calculus''' or the '''second-order lambda calculus''', is a [[typed lambda calculus]] that differs from the [[simply typed lambda calculus]] by the introduction of a mechanism of [[universal quantification]] over types. System F thus formalizes the notion of [[parametric polymorphism]] in [[programming language]]s, and forms a theoretical basis for languages such as [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]] and [[ML (programming language)|ML]]. System F was discovered independently by [[logician]] [[Jean-Yves Girard]] (1972) and [[computer scientist]] [[John C. Reynolds]] (1974).\n\nWhereas [[simply typed lambda calculus]] has variables ranging over terms, and binders for them, System F additionally has variables ranging over ''types'', and binders for them. As an example, the fact that the identity function can have any type of the form A\u2192 A would be formalized in System F as the judgment\n\n:<math>\\vdash \\Lambda\\alpha. \\lambda x^\\alpha.x: \\forall\\alpha.\\alpha \\to \\alpha</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\alpha</math> is a '''[[type variable]]'''.  The upper-case <math>\\Lambda</math> is traditionally used to denote type-level functions, as opposed to the lower-case <math>\\lambda</math> which is used for value-level functions. (The superscripted <math>\\alpha</math> means that the bound ''x'' is of type <math>\\alpha</math>; the expression after the colon is the type of the lambda expression preceding it.)\n\nAs a [[term rewriting system]], System F is [[Normalization property (lambda-calculus)|strongly normalizing]]. However, type inference in System F (without explicit type annotations) is undecidable. Under the [[Curry\u2013Howard isomorphism]], System F corresponds to the fragment of second-order [[intuitionistic logic]] that uses only universal quantification. System F can be seen as part of the [[lambda cube]], together with even more expressive typed lambda calculi, including those with [[dependent types]].\n\nAccording to Girard, the \"F\" in ''System F'' was picked by chance.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Girard|first=Jean-Yves|title=The system F of variable types, fifteen years later|journal=Theoretical Computer Science|volume=45|page=160|doi=10.1016/0304-3975(86)90044-7|quote=However, in [3] it was shown that the obvious rules of conversion for this system, called F by chance, were converging.|year=1986}}</ref>\n\n== Typing rules ==\n\nThe typing rules of System F are those of simply typed lambda calculus with the addition of the following:\n\n{| align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"9\"\n| align=\"center\" | <math>{\\frac{\\Gamma\\vdash M\\mathbin{:}\\forall\\alpha.\\sigma}{\\Gamma\\vdash M\\tau\\mathbin{:}\\sigma[\\tau/\\alpha]} }</math> (1)\n| align=\"center\" | <math>{\\frac{\\Gamma\\vdash M\\mathbin{:}\\sigma}{\\Gamma\\vdash\\lambda\\alpha.M\\mathbin{:}\\forall\\alpha\\mathbin{:}\\sigma}}</math> (2)\n|}\n\nwhere <math>\\sigma, \\tau</math> are types and <math>\\alpha</math> is a type variable. The first rule is that of application, and the second is that of abstraction.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cse.chalmers.se/research/group/logic/TypesSS05/Extra/lectnotes_vol1.pdf |title=Proofs of Programs and Formalisation of Mathematics |vauthors=Geuvers H, Nordstr\u00f6m B, Dowek G}}</ref>\n\n== Logic and predicates ==\nThe <math>\\scriptstyle \\mathsf{Boolean}</math> type is defined as:\n<math>\\scriptstyle\\forall\\alpha.\\alpha \\to \\alpha \\to \\alpha</math>, where <math>\\scriptstyle\\alpha</math> is a [[type variable]]. This means: <math>\\scriptstyle \\mathsf{Boolean}</math> is the type of all functions which take as input a type &alpha; and two expressions of type &alpha;, and produce as output an expression of type &alpha; (note that we consider <math>\\to</math> to be [[right-associative]].)\n\nThe following two definitions for the boolean values <math>\\scriptstyle\\mathbf{T}</math> and <math>\\scriptstyle\\mathbf{F}</math> are used, extending the definition of [[Church encoding#Church Booleans|Church booleans]]:\n\n: <math>\\mathbf{T} = \\Lambda\\alpha{.}\\lambda x^{\\alpha} \\lambda y^\\alpha{.}x</math> <!-- These didn't render without the {}-wrapped around the . -->\n: <math>\\mathbf{F} = \\Lambda\\alpha{.}\\lambda x^{\\alpha} \\lambda y^{\\alpha}{.}y</math>\n\n(Note that the above two functions require ''three'' &mdash; not two &mdash; arguments. The latter two should be lambda expressions, but the first one should be a type. This fact is reflected in the fact that the type of these expressions is <math>\\scriptstyle\\forall\\alpha.\\alpha \\to \\alpha \\to \\alpha</math>; the universal quantifier binding the &alpha; corresponds to the &Lambda; binding the alpha in the lambda expression itself. Also, note that <math>\\scriptstyle\\mathsf{Boolean}</math> is a convenient shorthand for <math>\\scriptstyle\\forall\\alpha.\\alpha \\to \\alpha \\to \\alpha</math>, but it is not a symbol of System F itself, but rather a \"meta-symbol\". Likewise, <math>\\scriptstyle \\mathbf{T}</math> and <math>\\scriptstyle \\mathbf{F}</math> are also \"meta-symbols\", convenient shorthands, of System F \"assemblies\" (in the [https://books.google.com/books?id=IL-SI67hjI4C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Nicolas+Bourbaki&source=bl&ots=nbfmxi9gJK&sig=4nPo8EFXrQYwAC2y0pD0uGv-EGY&hl=en&sa=X&ei=3sYBUOukIMLW2AX4t_inCw&ved=0CD8Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=Nicolas%20Bourbaki&f=false Bourbaki sense]); otherwise, if such functions could be named (within System F), then there would be no need for the lambda-expressive apparatus capable of defining functions anonymously and for the [[fixed-point combinator]], which works around that restriction.)\n\nThen, with these two <math>\\scriptstyle\\lambda</math>-terms, we can define some logic operators (which are of type <math>\\scriptstyle \\mathsf{Boolean} \\rightarrow \\mathsf{Boolean} \\rightarrow \\mathsf{Boolean}</math>):\n: <math>\\begin{align}\n\\mathrm{AND} &= \\lambda x^{\\mathsf{Boolean}} \\lambda y^{\\mathsf{Boolean}}{.} x y\\, \\mathbf{F}\\\\\n\\mathrm{OR}  &= \\lambda x^{\\mathsf{Boolean}} \\lambda y^{\\mathsf{Boolean}}{.} x \\mathbf{T}\\, y\\\\\n\\mathrm{NOT} &= \\lambda x^{\\mathsf{Boolean}}{.} x \\mathbf{F}\\, \\mathbf{T} \n\\end{align}</math>\n\nAs in Church encodings, there is no need for an <tt>IFTHENELSE</tt> function as one can just use raw <math>\\scriptstyle\\mathsf{Boolean}</math>-typed terms as decision functions.

System F thus formalizes the notion of [[parametric polymorphism]] in [[programming language]]s, and forms a theoretical basis for languages such as [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]] and [[ML (programming language)|ML]]. System F was discovered independently by [[logician]] [[Jean-Yves Girard]] (1972) and [[computer scientist]] [[John C. Reynolds]] (1974).\n\nWhereas [[simply typed lambda calculus]] has variables ranging over terms, and binders for them, System F additionally has variables ranging over ''types'', and binders for them. As an example, the fact that the identity function can have any type of the form A\u2192 A would be formalized in System F as the judgment\n\n:<math>\\vdash \\Lambda\\alpha. \\lambda x^\\alpha.x: \\forall\\alpha.\\alpha \\to \\alpha</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\alpha</math> is a '''[[type variable]]'''.  The upper-case <math>\\Lambda</math> is traditionally used to denote type-level functions, as opposed to the lower-case <math>\\lambda</math> which is used for value-level functions. (The superscripted <math>\\alpha</math> means that the bound ''x'' is of type <math>\\alpha</math>; the expression after the colon is the type of the lambda expression preceding it.)\n\nAs a [[term rewriting system]], System F is [[Normalization property (lambda-calculus)|strongly normalizing]]. However, type inference in System F (without explicit type annotations) is undecidable. Under the [[Curry\u2013Howard isomorphism]], System F corresponds to the fragment of second-order [[intuitionistic logic]] that uses only universal quantification. System F can be seen as part of the [[lambda cube]], together with even more expressive typed lambda calculi, including those with [[dependent types]].\n\nAccording to Girard, the \"F\" in ''System F'' was picked by chance.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Girard|first=Jean-Yves|title=The system F of variable types, fifteen years later|journal=Theoretical Computer Science|volume=45|page=160|doi=10.1016/0304-3975(86)90044-7|quote=However, in [3] it was shown that the obvious rules of conversion for this system, called F by chance, were converging.|year=1986}}</ref>\n\n== Typing rules ==\n\nThe typing rules of System F are those of simply typed lambda calculus with the addition of the following:\n\n{| align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"9\"\n| align=\"center\" | <math>{\\frac{\\Gamma\\vdash M\\mathbin{:}\\forall\\alpha.\\sigma}{\\Gamma\\vdash M\\tau\\mathbin{:}\\sigma[\\tau/\\alpha]} }</math> (1)\n| align=\"center\" | <math>{\\frac{\\Gamma\\vdash M\\mathbin{:}\\sigma}{\\Gamma\\vdash\\lambda\\alpha.M\\mathbin{:}\\forall\\alpha\\mathbin{:}\\sigma}}</math> (2)\n|}\n\nwhere <math>\\sigma, \\tau</math> are types and <math>\\alpha</math> is a type variable.

This means: <math>\\scriptstyle \\mathsf{Boolean}</math> is the type of all functions which take as input a type &alpha; and two expressions of type &alpha;, and produce as output an expression of type &alpha; (note that we consider <math>\\to</math> to be [[right-associative]].)\n\nThe following two definitions for the boolean values <math>\\scriptstyle\\mathbf{T}</math> and <math>\\scriptstyle\\mathbf{F}</math> are used, extending the definition of [[Church encoding#Church Booleans|Church booleans]]:\n\n: <math>\\mathbf{T} = \\Lambda\\alpha{.}\\lambda x^{\\alpha} \\lambda y^\\alpha{.}x</math> <!-- These didn't render without the {}-wrapped around the . -->\n: <math>\\mathbf{F} = \\Lambda\\alpha{.}\\lambda x^{\\alpha} \\lambda y^{\\alpha}{.}y</math>\n\n(Note that the above two functions require ''three'' &mdash; not two &mdash; arguments. The latter two should be lambda expressions, but the first one should be a type. This fact is reflected in the fact that the type of these expressions is <math>\\scriptstyle\\forall\\alpha.\\alpha \\to \\alpha \\to \\alpha</math>; the universal quantifier binding the &alpha; corresponds to the &Lambda; binding the alpha in the lambda expression itself. Also, note that <math>\\scriptstyle\\mathsf{Boolean}</math> is a convenient shorthand for <math>\\scriptstyle\\forall\\alpha.\\alpha \\to \\alpha \\to \\alpha</math>, but it is not a symbol of System F itself, but rather a \"meta-symbol\". Likewise, <math>\\scriptstyle \\mathbf{T}</math> and <math>\\scriptstyle \\mathbf{F}</math> are also \"meta-symbols\", convenient shorthands, of System F \"assemblies\" (in the [https://books.google.com/books?id=IL-SI67hjI4C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Nicolas+Bourbaki&source=bl&ots=nbfmxi9gJK&sig=4nPo8EFXrQYwAC2y0pD0uGv-EGY&hl=en&sa=X&ei=3sYBUOukIMLW2AX4t_inCw&ved=0CD8Q6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=Nicolas%20Bourbaki&f=false Bourbaki sense]); otherwise, if such functions could be named (within System F), then there would be no need for the lambda-expressive apparatus capable of defining functions anonymously and for the [[fixed-point combinator]], which works around that restriction.)\n\nThen, with these two <math>\\scriptstyle\\lambda</math>-terms, we can define some logic operators (which are of type <math>\\scriptstyle \\mathsf{Boolean} \\rightarrow \\mathsf{Boolean} \\rightarrow \\mathsf{Boolean}</math>):\n: <math>\\begin{align}\n\\mathrm{AND} &= \\lambda x^{\\mathsf{Boolean}} \\lambda y^{\\mathsf{Boolean}}{.} x y\\, \\mathbf{F}\\\\\n\\mathrm{OR}  &= \\lambda x^{\\mathsf{Boolean}} \\lambda y^{\\mathsf{Boolean}}{.} x \\mathbf{T}\\, y\\\\\n\\mathrm{NOT} &= \\lambda x^{\\mathsf{Boolean}}{.} x \\mathbf{F}\\, \\mathbf{T} \n\\end{align}</math>\n\nAs in Church encodings, there is no need for an <tt>IFTHENELSE</tt> function as one can just use raw <math>\\scriptstyle\\mathsf{Boolean}</math>-typed terms as decision functions. However, if one is requested:\n: <math>\\mathrm{IFTHENELSE} = \\Lambda \\alpha.\\lambda x^{\\mathsf{Boolean}}\\lambda y^{\\alpha}\\lambda z^{\\alpha}. x \\alpha y z </math>\nwill do.\nA ''predicate'' is a function which returns a <math>\\scriptstyle\\mathsf{Boolean}</math>-typed value.

System F<sub>\u03c9</sub> does not permit mappings from values to types ([[Dependent types]]), though it does permit mappings from values to values (<math>\\lambda</math> abstraction), mappings from types to values (<math>\\Lambda</math> abstraction, sometimes written <math>\\forall</math>) and mappings from types to types (<math>\\lambda</math> abstraction at the level of types)\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Existential types]] \u2014 the existentially quantified counterparts of universal types\n* [[System F-sub|System F<sub>&lt;:</sub>]] \u2014 extends system F with subtyping\n* [[System U]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n{{refbegin}}\n*{{cite conference\n  | first = Jean-Yves | last = Girard | authorlink = Jean-Yves Girard\n  | title = Une Extension de l'Interpretation de G\u00f6del \u00e0 l'Analyse, et son Application \u00e0 l'\u00c9limination des Coupures dans l'Analyse et la Th\u00e9orie des Types\n  | booktitle = Proceedings of the Second Scandinavian Logic Symposium\n  | date = 1971\n  | location = Amsterdam\n  | pages = 63\u201392\n  | doi = 10.1016/S0049-237X(08)70843-7\n  }}\n* {{citation\n | last = Girard | first = Jean-Yves\n | author-link = Jean-Yves Girard \n | year = 1972\n | title = Interpr\u00e9tation fonctionnelle et \u00e9limination des coupures de l'arithm\u00e9tique d'ordre sup\u00e9rieur\n | type = Ph.D. thesis\n | publisher = Universit\u00e9 Paris 7\n | language = French\n | ref = harv\n}}.\n*{{cite conference\n  | first = John | last = Reynolds | authorlink = John_C._Reynolds\n  | title = Towards a Theory of Type Structure\n  | date = 1974\n  | url = http://repository.cmu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=2289&context=compsci\n  }}\n*{{cite book |first=Jean-Yves |last=Girard |first2=Yves |last2=Lafont |first3=Paul |last3=Taylor |title=Proofs and Types |url=http://www.PaulTaylor.EU/stable/Proofs%2BTypes.html |date=1989 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-37181-0}}\n*{{cite conference |first=J.

Thus the mean value theorem says that given any chord of a smooth curve, we can find a point lying between the end-points of the chord such that the tangent at that point is parallel to the chord. The following proof illustrates this idea.\n\nDefine <math>g(x)=f(x)-rx</math> , where <math>r</math> is a constant. Since <math>f</math> is continuous on <math>[a,b]</math> and differentiable on <math>(a,b)</math> , the same is true for <math>g</math> . We now want to choose <math>r</math> so that <math>g</math> satisfies the conditions of [[Rolle's theorem]]. Namely\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}g(a)=g(b)&\\iff f(a)-ra=f(b)-rb\\\\ &\\iff r(b-a)=f(b)-f(a) \\\\&\\iff r=\\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}\\cdot\\end{align}</math>\n\nBy [[Rolle's theorem]], since <math>g</math> is differentiable and <math>g(a)=g(b)</math> , there is some <math>c</math> in <math>(a,b)</math> for which <math>g'(c)=0</math> , and it follows from the equality <math>g(x)=f(x)-rx</math> that,\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}&g'(x) = f'(x) -r \\\\& g'(c) = 0\\\\&g'(c) = f'(c) - r = 0 \\\\&\\Rightarrow f'(c) = r = \\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a} \\end{align}\n</math>\n\n==A simple application==\nAssume that ''f'' is a continuous, real-valued function, defined on an arbitrary interval ''I'' of the real line. If the derivative of ''f'' at every [[interior (topology)|interior point]] of the interval ''I'' exists and is zero, then ''f'' is [[constant function|constant]] in the interior.\n\n'''Proof:''' Assume the derivative of ''f'' at every [[interior (topology)|interior point]] of the interval ''I'' exists and is zero. Let (''a'', ''b'') be an arbitrary open interval in ''I''. By the mean value theorem, there exists a point ''c'' in (''a'',''b'') such that\n\n:<math>0=f'(c)=\\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{b-a}.</math>\n\nThis implies that ''f''(''a'') = ''f''(''b''). Thus, ''f'' is constant on the interior of ''I'' and thus is constant on ''I'' by continuity. (See below for a multivariable version of this result.)\n\n'''Remarks:''' \n* Only continuity of ''f'', not differentiability, is needed at the endpoints of the interval ''I''.  No hypothesis of continuity needs to be stated if ''I'' is an [[open interval]], since the existence of a derivative at a point implies the continuity at this point.  (See the section [[Derivative#Continuity and differentiability|continuity and differentiability]] of the article [[derivative]].)\n* The differentiability of ''f'' can be relaxed to [[one-sided derivatives|one-sided differentiability]], a proof given in the article on [[semi-differentiability]].\n\n==Cauchy's mean value theorem==<!-- This section is linked from [[Taylor's theorem]] -->\n'''Cauchy's mean value theorem''', also known as the '''extended mean value theorem''',<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ExtendedMean-ValueTheorem.html|title=Extended Mean-Value Theorem|last=W.|first=Weisstein, Eric|website=mathworld.wolfram.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-08}}</ref> is a generalization of the mean value theorem. It states: If functions ''f'' and ''g'' are both continuous on the closed interval [''a'', ''b''], and differentiable on the open interval (''a'', ''b''), then there exists some ''c'' \u2208 (''a'', ''b''), such that<ref name=\":0\" />\n[[Image:Cauchy.svg|right|thumb|260px|Geometrical meaning of Cauchy's theorem]]\n\n:<math>(f(b)-f(a))g'(c)=(g(b)-g(a))f'(c).</math>\n\nOf course, if {{nowrap|''g''(''a'') \u2260 ''g''(''b'')}} and if {{nowrap|''g\u2032''(''c'') \u2260 0}}, this is equivalent to:\n\n:<math>\\frac{f'(c)}{g'(c)}=\\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{g(b)-g(a)}.</math>\n\nGeometrically, this means that there is some [[tangent]] to the graph of the [[curve]]<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.math24.net/cauchys-mean-value-theorem/|title=Cauchy's Mean Value Theorem|work=Math24|access-date=2018-10-08|language=en-US}}</ref>\n\n:<math>\\begin{cases}[a,b] \\to \\mathbf{R}^2\\\\t\\mapsto (f(t),g(t))\\end{cases}</math>\n\nwhich is [[Parallel (geometry)|parallel]] to the line defined by the points (''f''(''a''), ''g''(''a'')) and (''f''(''b''), ''g''(''b'')). However Cauchy's theorem does not claim the existence of such a tangent in all cases where (''f''(''a''), ''g''(''a'')) and (''f''(''b''), ''g''(''b'')) are distinct points, since it might be satisfied only for some value ''c'' with {{nowrap|''f\u2032''(''c'') {{=}} ''g\u2032''(''c'') {{=}} 0}}, in other words a value for which the mentioned curve is [[Stationary point|stationary]]; in such points no tangent to the curve is likely to be defined at all. An example of this situation is the curve given by\n\n:<math>t\\mapsto(t^3,1-t^2),</math>\n\nwhich on the interval [\u22121, 1] goes from the point (\u22121, 0) to (1, 0), yet never has a horizontal tangent; however it has a stationary point (in fact a [[cusp (singularity)|cusp]]) at {{nowrap|''t'' {{=}} 0}}.\n\nCauchy's mean value theorem can be used to prove [[l'H\u00f4pital's rule]]. The mean value theorem is the special case of Cauchy's mean value theorem when {{nowrap|''g''(''t'') {{=}} ''t''}}.\n\n===Proof of Cauchy's mean value theorem===\nThe proof of Cauchy's mean value theorem is based on the same idea as the proof of the mean value theorem.\n\n* Suppose ''g''(''a'') \u2260 ''g''(''b''). Define ''h''(''x'') = ''f''(''x'') \u2212 ''rg''(''x''), where ''r'' is fixed in such a way that ''h''(''a'') = ''h''(''b''), namely\n:: <math>\\begin{align}h(a)=h(b)&\\iff f(a)-rg(a)=f(b)-rg(b)\\\\ &\\iff r (g(b)-g(a))=f(b)-f(a)\\\\ &\\iff r=\\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{g(b)-g(a)}.\\end{align}</math>\n:Since ''f'' and ''g'' are continuous on [''a'', ''b''] and differentiable on (''a'', ''b''), the same is true for ''h''. All in all, ''h'' satisfies the conditions of [[Rolle's theorem]]: consequently, there is some ''c'' in (''a'', ''b'') for which ''h\u2032''(''c'') = 0. Now using the definition of ''h'' we have:\n::<math>0=h'(c)=f'(c)-rg'(c) = f'(c)- \\left (\\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{g(b)-g(a)} \\right ) g'(c).</math>\n:Therefore:\n::<math>f'(c)= \\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{g(b)-g(a)} g'(c),</math>\n:which implies the result.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n* If ''g''(''a'') = ''g''(''b''), then, applying [[Rolle's theorem]] to ''g'', it follows that there exists ''c'' in (''a'', ''b'') for which ''g\u2032''(''c'') = 0. Using this choice of ''c'', Cauchy's mean value theorem (trivially) holds.\n\n==Generalization for determinants==\nAssume that <math>f, g,</math> and <math>h</math> are differentiable functions on <math>(a,b)</math> that are continuous on <math>[a,b]</math>. Define\n\n:<math> D(x)=\\left |\\begin{array}{ccc}f(x) & g(x)& h(x)\\\\ f(a) & g(a) & h(a)\\\\ f(b) & g(b)& h(b)\\end{array}\\right|</math>\n\nThere exists <math>c\\in(a,b)</math> such that <math> D'(c)=0</math>.\n\nNotice that\n:<math> D'(x)=\\left |\\begin{array}{ccc}f'(x) & g'(x)& h'(x)\\\\ f(a) & g(a) & h(a)\\\\ f(b) & g(b)& h(b)\\end{array}\\right|</math>\nand if we place <math>h(x)=1</math>, we get Cauchy's mean value theorem. If we place <math>h(x)=1</math> and <math>g(x)=x</math> we get '''Lagrange's mean value theorem'''.\n\nThe proof of the generalization is quite simple: each of <math>D(a)</math> and <math>D(b)</math> are determinants with two identical rows, hence <math>D(a)=D(b)=0</math>. The Rolle's theorem implies that there exists <math>c\\in (a,b)</math> such that <math>D'(c)=0</math>.\n\n== Mean value theorem in several variables ==\nThe mean value theorem generalizes to real functions of multiple variables. The trick is to use parametrization to create a real function of one variable, and then apply the one-variable theorem.\n\nLet <math>G</math> be an open convex subset of <math>\\R^n</math> , and let <math>f:G\\to\\R</math> be a differentiable function. Fix points <math>x,y\\in G</math> , and define <math>g(t)=f\\Big((1-t)x+ty\\Big)</math> . Since <math>g</math> is a differentiable function in one variable, the mean value theorem gives:\n\n:<math>g(1)-g(0)=g'(c)</math>\n\nfor some <math>c</math> between 0 and 1. But since <math>g(1)=f(y)</math> and <math>g(0)=f(x)</math> , computing <math>g'(c)</math> explicitly we have:\n\n:<math>f(y)-f(x)=\\nabla f\\Big((1-c)x+cy\\Big)\\cdot (y-x)</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\nabla</math> denotes a [[gradient]] and <math>\\cdot</math> a [[dot product]]. Note that this is an exact analog of the theorem in one variable (in the case <math>n=1</math> this ''is'' the theorem in one variable). By the [[Cauchy\u2013Schwarz inequality]], the equation gives the estimate:\n\n:<math>\\Bigg|f(y)-f(x)\\Bigg|\\le\\Bigg|\\nabla f\\Big((1-c)x+cy\\Big)\\Bigg|\\ \\Big|y - x\\Big|.</math>\n\nIn particular, when the partial derivatives of <math>f</math> are bounded, <math>f</math> is [[Lipschitz continuity|Lipschitz continuous]] (and therefore [[Uniform continuity|uniformly continuous]]). Note that <math>f</math> is not assumed to be continuously differentiable or continuous on the closure of <math>G</math> . However, in order to use the chain rule to compute <math> g' </math>, we really do need to know that <math>f</math> is differentiable on <math>G</math>; the existence of the <math> x </math> and <math> y </math> partial derivatives by itself is not sufficient for the theorem to be true {{clarify|date=March 2018| reason=Sufficient for what to be true?}}.\n\nAs an application of the above, we prove that <math>f</math> is constant if <math>G</math> is open and connected and every partial derivative of <math>f</math> is 0. Pick some point <math>x_0\\in G</math> , and let <math>g(x)=f(x)-f(x_0)</math> . We want to show <math>g(x)=0</math> for every <math>x\\in G</math> . For that, let <math>E=\\{x\\in G:g(x)=0\\}</math> . Then ''E'' is closed and nonempty. It is open too: for every <math>x\\in E</math> ,\n\n:<math>\\Big|g(y)\\Big|=\\Bigg|g(y)-g(x)\\Bigg|\\le (0)\\Big|y-x\\Big|=0</math>\n\nfor every <math>y</math> in some neighborhood of <math>x</math> . (Here, it is crucial that <math>x</math> and <math>y</math> are sufficiently close to each other.) Since <math>G</math> is connected, we conclude <math>E=G</math> .\n\nThe above arguments are made in a coordinate-free manner; hence, they generalize to the case when <math>G</math> is a subset of a Banach space.\n\n== Mean value theorem for vector-valued functions ==\nThere is no exact analog of the mean value theorem for vector-valued functions.\n\nIn ''Principles of Mathematical Analysis,'' [[Walter Rudin|Rudin]] gives an inequality which can be applied to many of the same situations to which the mean value theorem is applicable in the one dimensional case:<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/1979RudinW|title=Principles of Mathematical Analysis (3rd ed.)|last=Rudin|first=Walter|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=1976|isbn=978-0-07-054235-8|location=New York|pages=113|quote=|via=}}</ref>\n\n'''Theorem.'''  ''For a continuous vector-valued function <math>\\mathbf{f}:[a,b]\\to\\mathbb{R}^k</math> differentiable on <math>(a,b)</math>, there exists <math>x\\in(a,b)</math> such that <math>|\\mathbf{f}'(x)|\\geq\\frac{1}{b-a}|\\mathbf{f}(b)-\\mathbf{f}(a)| </math>.''\n\n[[Jean Dieudonn\u00e9]] in his classic treatise ''Foundations of Modern Analysis'' discards the mean value theorem and replaces it by mean inequality as the proof is not constructive and one cannot find the mean value and in applications one only needs mean inequality. [[Serge Lang]] in ''Analysis I ''uses the mean value theorem, in integral form, as an instant reflex but this use requires the continuity of the derivative. If one uses the [[Henstock\u2013Kurzweil integral]] one can have the mean value theorem in integral form without the additional assumption that derivative should be continuous as every derivative is Henstock\u2013Kurzweil integrable. The problem is roughly speaking the following: If ''f'' : ''U'' \u2192 '''R'''<sup>''m''</sup> is a differentiable function (where ''U'' \u2282 '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> is open) and if ''x'' + ''th'', ''x, h'' \u2208 '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>, ''t'' \u2208 [0, 1] is the line segment in question (lying inside ''U''), then one can apply the above parametrization procedure to each of the component functions ''f<sub>i</sub>'' (''i'' = 1, ..., ''m'') of ''f'' (in the above notation set ''y'' = ''x'' + ''h''). In doing so one finds points ''x'' + ''t<sub>i</sub>h'' on the line segment satisfying\n\n:<math>f_i(x+h) - f_i(x) = \\nabla f_i (x + t_ih) \\cdot h.</math>\n\nBut generally there will not be a ''single'' point ''x'' + ''t*h'' on the line segment satisfying\n\n:<math>f_i(x+h) - f_i(x) = \\nabla f_i (x + t^* h) \\cdot h.</math>\n\nfor all ''i'' ''simultaneously''. For example, define:\n\n:<math>\\begin{cases} f : [0, 2 \\pi] \\to \\mathbf{R}^2 \\\\ f(x) = (\\cos(x), \\sin(x)) \\end{cases}</math>\n\nThen <math>f(2\\pi) - f(0) = \\mathbf{0} \\in \\mathbf{R}^2</math>, but <math>f_1'(x)=-\\sin (x)</math> and <math>f_2'(x)=\\cos (x)</math> are never simultaneously zero as <math>x</math> ranges over <math>\\left[0, 2 \\pi\\right]</math>.\n\nHowever a certain type of generalization of the mean value theorem to vector-valued functions is obtained as follows: Let ''f'' be a continuously differentiable real-valued function defined on an open interval ''I'', and let ''x'' as well as ''x'' + ''h'' be points of ''I''. The mean value theorem in one variable tells us that there exists some ''t*'' between 0 and 1 such that\n\n:<math>f(x+h)-f(x) = f'(x+t^*h)\\cdot h.</math>\n\nOn the other hand, we have, by the [[fundamental theorem of calculus]] followed by a change of variables,\n\n:<math> f(x+h)-f(x) = \\int_x^{x+h} f'(u) \\, du = \\left (\\int_0^1 f'(x+th)\\,dt\\right)\\cdot h.</math>\n\nThus, the value ''f\u2032''(''x'' + ''t*h'') at the particular point ''t*'' has been replaced by the mean value\n\n:<math>\\int_0^1 f'(x+th)\\,dt.</math>\n\nThis last version can be generalized to vector valued functions:\n\n:'''Lemma 1.'''

Define ''h''(''x'') = ''f''(''x'') \u2212 ''rg''(''x''), where ''r'' is fixed in such a way that ''h''(''a'') = ''h''(''b''), namely\n:: <math>\\begin{align}h(a)=h(b)&\\iff f(a)-rg(a)=f(b)-rg(b)\\\\ &\\iff r (g(b)-g(a))=f(b)-f(a)\\\\ &\\iff r=\\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{g(b)-g(a)}.\\end{align}</math>\n:Since ''f'' and ''g'' are continuous on [''a'', ''b''] and differentiable on (''a'', ''b''), the same is true for ''h''. All in all, ''h'' satisfies the conditions of [[Rolle's theorem]]: consequently, there is some ''c'' in (''a'', ''b'') for which ''h\u2032''(''c'') = 0. Now using the definition of ''h'' we have:\n::<math>0=h'(c)=f'(c)-rg'(c) = f'(c)- \\left (\\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{g(b)-g(a)} \\right ) g'(c).</math>\n:Therefore:\n::<math>f'(c)= \\frac{f(b)-f(a)}{g(b)-g(a)} g'(c),</math>\n:which implies the result.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n* If ''g''(''a'') = ''g''(''b''), then, applying [[Rolle's theorem]] to ''g'', it follows that there exists ''c'' in (''a'', ''b'') for which ''g\u2032''(''c'') = 0. Using this choice of ''c'', Cauchy's mean value theorem (trivially) holds.\n\n==Generalization for determinants==\nAssume that <math>f, g,</math> and <math>h</math> are differentiable functions on <math>(a,b)</math> that are continuous on <math>[a,b]</math>. Define\n\n:<math> D(x)=\\left |\\begin{array}{ccc}f(x) & g(x)& h(x)\\\\ f(a) & g(a) & h(a)\\\\ f(b) & g(b)& h(b)\\end{array}\\right|</math>\n\nThere exists <math>c\\in(a,b)</math> such that <math> D'(c)=0</math>.\n\nNotice that\n:<math> D'(x)=\\left |\\begin{array}{ccc}f'(x) & g'(x)& h'(x)\\\\ f(a) & g(a) & h(a)\\\\ f(b) & g(b)& h(b)\\end{array}\\right|</math>\nand if we place <math>h(x)=1</math>, we get Cauchy's mean value theorem. If we place <math>h(x)=1</math> and <math>g(x)=x</math> we get '''Lagrange's mean value theorem'''.\n\nThe proof of the generalization is quite simple: each of <math>D(a)</math> and <math>D(b)</math> are determinants with two identical rows, hence <math>D(a)=D(b)=0</math>. The Rolle's theorem implies that there exists <math>c\\in (a,b)</math> such that <math>D'(c)=0</math>.\n\n== Mean value theorem in several variables ==\nThe mean value theorem generalizes to real functions of multiple variables. The trick is to use parametrization to create a real function of one variable, and then apply the one-variable theorem.\n\nLet <math>G</math> be an open convex subset of <math>\\R^n</math> , and let <math>f:G\\to\\R</math> be a differentiable function. Fix points <math>x,y\\in G</math> , and define <math>g(t)=f\\Big((1-t)x+ty\\Big)</math> . Since <math>g</math> is a differentiable function in one variable, the mean value theorem gives:\n\n:<math>g(1)-g(0)=g'(c)</math>\n\nfor some <math>c</math> between 0 and 1. But since <math>g(1)=f(y)</math> and <math>g(0)=f(x)</math> , computing <math>g'(c)</math> explicitly we have:\n\n:<math>f(y)-f(x)=\\nabla f\\Big((1-c)x+cy\\Big)\\cdot (y-x)</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\nabla</math> denotes a [[gradient]] and <math>\\cdot</math> a [[dot product]]. Note that this is an exact analog of the theorem in one variable (in the case <math>n=1</math> this ''is'' the theorem in one variable). By the [[Cauchy\u2013Schwarz inequality]], the equation gives the estimate:\n\n:<math>\\Bigg|f(y)-f(x)\\Bigg|\\le\\Bigg|\\nabla f\\Big((1-c)x+cy\\Big)\\Bigg|\\ \\Big|y - x\\Big|.</math>\n\nIn particular, when the partial derivatives of <math>f</math> are bounded, <math>f</math> is [[Lipschitz continuity|Lipschitz continuous]] (and therefore [[Uniform continuity|uniformly continuous]]). Note that <math>f</math> is not assumed to be continuously differentiable or continuous on the closure of <math>G</math> . However, in order to use the chain rule to compute <math> g' </math>, we really do need to know that <math>f</math> is differentiable on <math>G</math>; the existence of the <math> x </math> and <math> y </math> partial derivatives by itself is not sufficient for the theorem to be true {{clarify|date=March 2018| reason=Sufficient for what to be true?}}.\n\nAs an application of the above, we prove that <math>f</math> is constant if <math>G</math> is open and connected and every partial derivative of <math>f</math> is 0. Pick some point <math>x_0\\in G</math> , and let <math>g(x)=f(x)-f(x_0)</math> . We want to show <math>g(x)=0</math> for every <math>x\\in G</math> . For that, let <math>E=\\{x\\in G:g(x)=0\\}</math> . Then ''E'' is closed and nonempty. It is open too: for every <math>x\\in E</math> ,\n\n:<math>\\Big|g(y)\\Big|=\\Bigg|g(y)-g(x)\\Bigg|\\le (0)\\Big|y-x\\Big|=0</math>\n\nfor every <math>y</math> in some neighborhood of <math>x</math> . (Here, it is crucial that <math>x</math> and <math>y</math> are sufficiently close to each other.) Since <math>G</math> is connected, we conclude <math>E=G</math> .\n\nThe above arguments are made in a coordinate-free manner; hence, they generalize to the case when <math>G</math> is a subset of a Banach space.\n\n== Mean value theorem for vector-valued functions ==\nThere is no exact analog of the mean value theorem for vector-valued functions.\n\nIn ''Principles of Mathematical Analysis,'' [[Walter Rudin|Rudin]] gives an inequality which can be applied to many of the same situations to which the mean value theorem is applicable in the one dimensional case:<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/1979RudinW|title=Principles of Mathematical Analysis (3rd ed.)|last=Rudin|first=Walter|publisher=McGraw-Hill|year=1976|isbn=978-0-07-054235-8|location=New York|pages=113|quote=|via=}}</ref>\n\n'''Theorem.'''  ''For a continuous vector-valued function <math>\\mathbf{f}:[a,b]\\to\\mathbb{R}^k</math> differentiable on <math>(a,b)</math>, there exists <math>x\\in(a,b)</math> such that <math>|\\mathbf{f}'(x)|\\geq\\frac{1}{b-a}|\\mathbf{f}(b)-\\mathbf{f}(a)| </math>.''\n\n[[Jean Dieudonn\u00e9]] in his classic treatise ''Foundations of Modern Analysis'' discards the mean value theorem and replaces it by mean inequality as the proof is not constructive and one cannot find the mean value and in applications one only needs mean inequality. [[Serge Lang]] in ''Analysis I ''uses the mean value theorem, in integral form, as an instant reflex but this use requires the continuity of the derivative. If one uses the [[Henstock\u2013Kurzweil integral]] one can have the mean value theorem in integral form without the additional assumption that derivative should be continuous as every derivative is Henstock\u2013Kurzweil integrable. The problem is roughly speaking the following: If ''f'' : ''U'' \u2192 '''R'''<sup>''m''</sup> is a differentiable function (where ''U'' \u2282 '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> is open) and if ''x'' + ''th'', ''x, h'' \u2208 '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup>, ''t'' \u2208 [0, 1] is the line segment in question (lying inside ''U''), then one can apply the above parametrization procedure to each of the component functions ''f<sub>i</sub>'' (''i'' = 1, ..., ''m'') of ''f'' (in the above notation set ''y'' = ''x'' + ''h''). In doing so one finds points ''x'' + ''t<sub>i</sub>h'' on the line segment satisfying\n\n:<math>f_i(x+h) - f_i(x) = \\nabla f_i (x + t_ih) \\cdot h.</math>\n\nBut generally there will not be a ''single'' point ''x'' + ''t*h'' on the line segment satisfying\n\n:<math>f_i(x+h) - f_i(x) = \\nabla f_i (x + t^* h) \\cdot h.</math>\n\nfor all ''i'' ''simultaneously''. For example, define:\n\n:<math>\\begin{cases} f : [0, 2 \\pi] \\to \\mathbf{R}^2 \\\\ f(x) = (\\cos(x), \\sin(x)) \\end{cases}</math>\n\nThen <math>f(2\\pi) - f(0) = \\mathbf{0} \\in \\mathbf{R}^2</math>, but <math>f_1'(x)=-\\sin (x)</math> and <math>f_2'(x)=\\cos (x)</math> are never simultaneously zero as <math>x</math> ranges over <math>\\left[0, 2 \\pi\\right]</math>.\n\nHowever a certain type of generalization of the mean value theorem to vector-valued functions is obtained as follows: Let ''f'' be a continuously differentiable real-valued function defined on an open interval ''I'', and let ''x'' as well as ''x'' + ''h'' be points of ''I''. The mean value theorem in one variable tells us that there exists some ''t*'' between 0 and 1 such that\n\n:<math>f(x+h)-f(x) = f'(x+t^*h)\\cdot h.</math>\n\nOn the other hand, we have, by the [[fundamental theorem of calculus]] followed by a change of variables,\n\n:<math> f(x+h)-f(x) = \\int_x^{x+h} f'(u) \\, du = \\left (\\int_0^1 f'(x+th)\\,dt\\right)\\cdot h.</math>\n\nThus, the value ''f\u2032''(''x'' + ''t*h'') at the particular point ''t*'' has been replaced by the mean value\n\n:<math>\\int_0^1 f'(x+th)\\,dt.</math>\n\nThis last version can be generalized to vector valued functions:\n\n:'''Lemma 1.''' Let ''U'' \u2282 '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> be open, ''f'' : ''U'' \u2192 '''R'''<sup>''m''</sup> continuously differentiable, and ''x'' \u2208 ''U'', ''h'' \u2208 '''R'''<sup>''n''</sup> vectors such that the line segment ''x'' + ''th'',  0 \u2264 ''t'' \u2264 1 remains in ''U''. Then we have:\n::<math>f(x+h)-f(x) = \\left (\\int_0^1 Df(x+th)\\,dt\\right)\\cdot h,</math>\n:where ''Df'' denotes the [[Jacobian matrix]] of ''f'' and the integral of a matrix is to be understood componentwise.\n\n'''Proof.'''

providers in the country, Canadian law grants domestic broadcast stations the right to require that these signals be [[Simultaneous substitution|substituted with their own]] if they are carrying the same program in simulcast with a U.S. station (\"simsub\"). This policy is intended to help protect Canadian advertising revenue from being lost to viewers watching via U.S. feeds of a program. In 2016, as part of a larger series of regulatory reforms, the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]] (CRTC) banned the Super Bowl from being substituted under these circumstances, meaning that the telecast on [[CTV Television|CTV]]\u2014a simulcast of the U.S. telecast with Canadian advertising inserted, would co-exist with feeds of the game from U.S. network affiliates. The CRTC cited dissatisfaction surrounding the practice from Canadian viewers\u2014particularly the unavailability of the U.S. [[Super Bowl commercials|commercials]], which the CRTC cited as being an \"integral part\" of the game based on this reception, but also other technical problems caused by poorly implemented simsubs (such as reduced quality and missing content due to mistimed transitions back into the U.S. program feed).<ref name=gandm-bellappeal/><ref name=gandm-nomoresuperbowlsimsub>{{cite news|title=CRTC opens door for U.S. Super Bowl ads to air on Canadian TV|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/industry-news/marketing/crtc-opens-door-for-us-super-bowl-ads-to-air-on-canadian-tv/article22696212/|newspaper=[[The Globe and Mail]]|date=January 29, 2015|accessdate=January 29, 2015}}</ref><ref name=crtc-2015-25>{{cite web|title=Broadcasting Regulatory Policy CRTC 2015-25|url=http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/2015/2015-25.htm|publisher=Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission|accessdate=February 3, 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe NFL's Canadian rights holder [[Bell Media]], as well as the league itself, have displayed objections to the policy; Bell felt that the decision devalued its exclusive Canadian rights to the game, and violated Canada's [[Broadcasting Act (1991)|Broadcasting Act]], which forbids the \"making of regulations singling out a particular program or licensee.\"<ref name=gandm-bellappeal>{{cite news|title=Bell appeals CRTC decision to air U.S. Super Bowl commercials|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/bell-to-fight-crtc-ruling-on-super-bowl-simsub/article23244271/|accessdate=March 12, 2015|work=[[The Globe and Mail]]|location=Toronto|date=March 2, 2015}}</ref> On November 2, 2016, Bell was granted the right to challenge the ruling in the [[Federal Court of Appeal (Canada)|Federal Court of Appeal]].<ref name=\"gandm-bellwinappeal\">{{cite news|title=Bell wins right to appeal new Super Bowl ad policy|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/bell-wins-right-to-appeal-new-super-bowl-ad-policy/article32643801/|website=The Globe and Mail|accessdate=November 2, 2016}}</ref> Bell, the NFL, and government representatives from both Canada and the U.S., have lobbied the CRTC for the rule to be retracted.<ref name=\"bloomberg-blitzes\">{{cite web|title=NFL Blitzes Trudeau in Arcane Super Bowl Advertising Dispute|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-01-09/nfl-blitzes-trudeau-in-arcane-super-bowl-advertising-dispute|website=Bloomberg|accessdate=January 18, 2017}}</ref> However, court action on the ruling was not taken in time for the game, meaning that it was in effect for the first time during Super Bowl LI.<ref name=\"gandm-cdnratings\">{{cite news|title=Bell\u2019s Super Bowl ratings drop 39 per cent as CRTC ad policy takes effect|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/bells-super-bowl-ratings-drop-39-per-cent-as-ad-policy-takes-effect/article33919635/|website=The Globe and Mail|accessdate=February 7, 2017}}</ref> Bell Media cited the decision, among other factors, as justification for a planned series of layoffs it announced on January 31, 2017.<ref name=\"fp-belllayoffs17\">{{cite web|last1=Jackson|first1=Emily|title=Bell Media cites CRTC Super Bowl ad policy as a factor in latest round of layoffs|url=http://business.financialpost.com/fp-tech-desk/bell-media-cites-crtc-super-bowl-ad-policy-in-latest-round-of-layoffs|website=Financial Post|accessdate=February 1, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe simsub prohibition only applied to the game itself, and not pre-game or post-game programming (which was simulcast with Fox and subject to simsub).

The longest play from scrimmage was a 37-yard carry by Falcons running back [[Devonta Freeman]], which did not lead to any points, though it would be the longest run of the game for either team.\n\nOn the first play of the second quarter, New England's quarterback [[Tom Brady]] completed a 27-yard pass to wide receiver [[Julian Edelman]] on the Falcons 33-yard line. But on the next play, linebacker [[Deion Jones]] stripped the ball from running back [[LeGarrette Blount]]; the fumble was recovered by defensive back [[Robert Alford (American football)|Robert Alford]] on the 29-yard line. On the next two plays, [[Matt Ryan (American football)|Matt Ryan]] completed passes to [[Julio Jones]] for gains of 19 and 23 yards. Freeman ran the ball on the next three plays, covering the remaining 29 yards to the end zone, with the last carry being a 5-yard touchdown run that put Atlanta on the board with a 7\u20130 lead.\n\nNew England failed to get a first down on the series following the Freeman score, and the Falcons moved the ball 62 yards in five plays.

On 3rd-and-9, he threw a 19-yard touchdown pass to tight end [[Austin Hooper]], giving the Falcons a 14\u20130 lead.

The drive stalled at the Falcons 20-yard line, but [[Stephen Gostkowski]] successfully made a field goal with two seconds left on the clock to send the teams into their locker rooms with the score 21\u20133.\n\n===Second half===\n\nNew England had an early third quarter scoring opportunity when Edelman returned a punt 26 yards to the Patriots' 47-yard line, but they could not gain a first down on the drive. Following the Patriots' punt, the Falcons started their drive on their own 15-yard line; Ryan completed two long passes to wide receiver Taylor Gabriel for gains of 17 and 35 yards to bring the ball to the New England 28-yard line. Four plays later, Ryan finished the 85-yard drive with a 6-yard touchdown pass to running back [[Tevin Coleman]], giving the Falcons a 28\u20133 lead with 8:31 left in the quarter. On the next series, Brady led the Patriots 75 yards in 13 plays for a responding touchdown, completing five of seven passes for 43 yards, the biggest a 17-yard completion to [[Danny Amendola]] on 4th-and-3 from the New England 46-yard line. Brady also made a big play by helping his own cause, rushing for a 15-yard gain (which would be the longest rushing play by the Patriots on the day) on 3rd-and-8 from the Atlanta 35-yard line. Three subsequent carries by Blount moved the ball 15 yards to the 5-yard line, and then Brady threw the ball to White for a touchdown, but Gostkowski missed an extra point as the attempt struck the goalpost, thereby sending the score to 28\u20139.\n\nNew England then attempted an [[onside kick]], but the ball was recovered by Falcons linebacker [[LaRoy Reynolds]], and a penalty against Gostkowski for touching the ball before it went ten yards, gave Atlanta even better field position. Ryan completed a 9-yard pass to Hooper to the Patriots 32-yard-line, but on the next play, a holding penalty on Atlanta offensive lineman [[Jake Matthews (American football)|Jake Matthews]] pushed the team back ten yards. Then, after an incompletion, [[Trey Flowers]] and [[Kyle Van Noy]] shared a sack on Ryan that effectively forced the Falcons to punt on the first play of the fourth quarter.\n\n[[Matt Bosher]]'s 42-yard punt pinned the Patriots back on their own 13-yard line. Brady led the next drive down the field, completing three passes to wide receiver [[Malcolm Mitchell]] for 40 yards and one to Bennett for 25 to bring the ball to the Falcons 7-yard line. However, Brady was sacked twice by defensive tackle [[Grady Jarrett]] over the next three plays. The Patriots had to settle for a field goal, where Gostkowski attempted a 33-yard field goal, which was good, and it cut their deficit to two scores, 28\u201312, with less than 10 minutes left in the game. Atlanta had burned two of their three time outs on defense and equipment malfunction.\n\nOn the third play of Atlanta's ensuing drive, Freeman missed his blocking assignment on a New England blitz that allowed linebacker [[Dont'a Hightower]] to sack Ryan as he was winding up for a pass, resulting in a fumble that was recovered by defensive tackle [[Alan Branch]] on the Falcons 25-yard line. It was Ryan's first turnover in two months.<ref name=\"Gagnon\"/> New England soon cashed in their scoring opportunity, with Brady throwing a 6-yard touchdown pass to Amendola. Then White took a direct snap in for a two-point conversion to make the score 28\u201320 in favor of Atlanta with 5:56 left on the clock. The Patriots had run the same play for a two-point conversion with [[Kevin Faulk]] in their [[Super Bowl XXXVIII]] victory.\n\nOn the first play of Atlanta's next possession, Freeman caught a short pass from Ryan and ran it for a 39-yard gain, the longest play of the game for either team. Then on 2nd-and-9 from the Patriots 49-yard line, Ryan threw a deep pass to Jones, who made an acrobatic catch at the right sideline for a 27-yard gain, giving the Falcons a first down on the Patriots 22-yard line with 4:40 left on the clock and a chance for a late-game two-score lead that would have clinched the game.<ref>{{cite AV media|people=|date=February 5, 2017|title=Julio Jones Unreal Sideline Catch! \u2013 Patriots vs. Falcons \u2013 Super Bowl LI Highlights|medium=[[YouTube]]|language=English|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSirjCbbP1c|access-date=September 27, 2019|location=Houston|publisher=[[National Football League]]}}</ref> On the next play, Freeman ran for a 1-yard loss on a tackle by [[Devin McCourty]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Brooks|first=Bucky|title=Super Bowl LI explained: How Patriots pulled off epic comeback|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000784357/article/super-bowl-li-explained-how-patriots-pulled-off-epic-comeback|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=NFL.com|date=February 7, 2017|access-date=September 25, 2019}}</ref> Atlanta tried to pass the ball on second down, but Flowers sacked Ryan for a 12-yard loss on the Patriots 35-yard line. Ryan then completed a 9-yard pass to [[Mohamed Sanu]] on 3rd-and 23, but this was nullified due to an offensive holding penalty on Matthews. Now out of field goal range and faced with 3rd-and-33 from the New England 45-yard line, Ryan threw an incomplete pass, and the team was left with no good choice but to punt the ball to New England.<ref name=\"Gagnon\"/>\n\nBosher's 36-yard kick gave the Patriots the ball on their own 9-yard line with 3:30 left on the clock and two of their timeouts left. After two incompletions, Brady picked up a first down with a 16-yard pass to [[Chris Hogan (American football)|Chris Hogan]]. After an 11-yard pass to Mitchell, Brady threw a pass that was nearly intercepted by Alford. Instead, he batted the ball in the air, and it fell into the arms of Edelman, who made a diving catch as it bounced off Alford's shoe. Edelman just barely managed to get his hands under the ball before it hit the ground, securing the football for what would be ruled as a 23-yard pass completion. Atlanta challenged the on-field ruling, but referee [[Carl Cheffers]] announced that the call stood, and Atlanta was charged with their final timeout.<ref>{{cite AV media|people=|date=February 5, 2017|title=Julian Edelman Makes Ridiculous Catch! \u2013 Patriots vs. Falcons \u2013 Super Bowl LI Highlights|medium=[[YouTube]]|language=English|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SiUNdkIwzQ|access-date=September 27, 2019|location=Houston|publisher=[[National Football League]]}}</ref> Brady's next pass to Amendola gained 20 yards to the Falcons' 21-yard line as the clock ran down below the two-minute warning. Two more passes to White gained 20 yards and gave New England a first down at the 1-yard line. With 58 seconds left, White scored on a 1-yard touchdown run, and Brady completed a 2-point conversion pass to Amendola, tying the score at 28 points a piece, thereby coming back from a 25-point deficit.\n\nWith the hopes of winning their first championship on the line, Atlanta started their drive deep in their own end with just under a minute and no time outs. The Falcons failed to get in range to score a possible game-winning field goal and punted, with the Patriots fair catching the ball at their own 35-yard line. The Patriots considered, but ultimately declined, ending regulation on what would have been the first [[fair catch kick]] ever attempted in a Super Bowl.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.boston.com/sports/new-england-patriots/2017/02/06/bill-belichick-passed-up-an-opportunity-to-end-super-bowl-51-in-the-weirdest-possible-way|title=Bill Belichick passed up an opportunity to end Super Bowl 51 in the weirdest possible way|first=Nick|last=DeCosta-Klipa|work=The Boston Globe|date=February 7, 2017|accessdate=February 7, 2017}}</ref> Instead, New England attempted a fake [[quarterback kneel]] running play for [[Dion Lewis]], who gained several yards but failed to score, ending the fourth quarter and forcing the game into overtime, the first time this had happened in the Super Bowl era, and the first in the NFL title game since the [[1958 NFL Championship Game|1958 meeting]] between the [[1958 Baltimore Colts season|Baltimore Colts]] and the [[1958 New York Giants season|New York Giants]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bowden|first1=Mark|title=The Best Game Ever: Giants vs. Colts, 1958, and the Birth of the Modern NFL|date=2008|publisher=Atlantic Monthly Press|isbn=978-0-87113-988-7|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/bestgameevergian00bowd}}</ref>\n\n===Overtime===\nThe Patriots won the coin toss to start overtime, and elected to receive the ball. Starting at their 25-yard line after a touchback, Brady completed passes to White, Amendola, and Hogan for gains of 6, 14, and 18 yards, respectively. Then, after White was dropped for a 3-yard loss, Brady completed a 15-yard pass to Edelman to the Falcons 25-yard line.

[[Jimmy Garoppolo]] and [[Jacoby Brissett]] each started two games in Brady's place. After his suspension ended, Brady took back command of the offense and went on to earn his 12th [[2017 Pro Bowl|Pro Bowl]] selection, passing for 3,554 yards and 28 touchdowns, with only two interceptions, while his 112.2 passer rating ranked second in the NFL. The team's leading receiver was [[Julian Edelman]], who caught 98 passes for 1,106 yards and added 135 more returning punts. Wide receivers [[Chris Hogan (American football)|Chris Hogan]] (38 receptions for 680 yards) and [[Malcolm Mitchell]] (32 receptions for 401 yards) were also significant receiving threats. Gronkowski caught 25 passes for 540 yards before suffering a season-ending back injury in week 13. Tight end [[Martellus Bennett]] stepped up in his absence, hauling in 55 receptions for 701 yards and a team-leading seven touchdown catches. Running back [[LeGarrette Blount]] was the team's top rusher with 1,168 yards and a league-leading 18 touchdowns.

Linebacker [[Dont'a Hightower]] earned his first Pro Bowl selection and made the second All-Pro team, compiling 65 tackles and 2\u00bd sacks. Linebacker [[Rob Ninkovich]] also made a big impact, recording 34 tackles, two forced fumbles, and four sacks. In the secondary, cornerback [[Malcolm Butler]] led the team with four interceptions, while [[Logan Ryan]] led the team in tackles and intercepted two passes. Safety [[Devin McCourty]] ranked second on the team with 83 tackles and notched one interception while earning his third career Pro Bowl selection.

Nine-year veteran quarterback [[Matt Ryan (American football)|Matt Ryan]] earned the [[NFL MVP]] and the [[AP NFL Offensive Player of the Year Award]], as well as his fourth career Pro Bowl selection, leading the league in passer rating (117.1). While he ranked only ninth in completions (373), his passing yards (4,944) and touchdowns (38) both ranked second in the NFL. His favorite target was receiver [[Julio Jones]], who caught 83 passes for 1,409 yards (second in the NFL) and six touchdowns. But Ryan had plenty of other options, such as newly acquired wide receivers [[Mohamed Sanu]] (59 receptions for 653 yards) and [[Taylor Gabriel]] (35 receptions for 579 yards and six touchdowns). Pro Bowl running back [[Devonta Freeman]] was the team's leading rusher, with 1,078 yards, 11 touchdowns, and 4.8 yards per rush. He was also a superb receiver out of the backfield, catching 54 passes for 462 yards and two more scores. Running back [[Tevin Coleman]] was also a major asset on the ground and through the air, with 520 rushing yards, 31 receptions for 421 yards, and 11 total touchdowns. The Falcons also had an excellent special teams unit led by veteran kick returner [[Eric Weems]]. His 24 punt returns for 273 yards gave him the sixth highest return average in the NFL (11.4), and he added another 391 yards returning kickoffs. Pro Bowl kicker [[Matt Bryant]] led the league in scoring with 158 points, while also ranking third in field goal percentage (91.8%).<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2016/scoring.htm |title=2016 NFL Scoring Summary |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=December 28, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/years/2016/kicking.htm |title=2016 NFL Kicking & Punting |website=Pro-Football-Reference.com |language=en |access-date=December 28, 2017}}</ref> Atlanta's offensive line featured center [[Alex Mack]], who earned his fourth Pro Bowl selection.<ref name=\"pro-football-reference.com\">{{cite web|url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/atl/2016.htm|title=2016 Atlanta Falcons Statistics & Players - Pro-Football-Reference.com|publisher=}}</ref>\n\nThe Falcons defensive line was led by defensive ends [[Adrian Clayborn]], who recorded five sacks and a fumble recovery, and long-time veteran [[Dwight Freeney]], who ranks as the NFL's 18th all-time leader in sacks (122\u00bd).

providers in the country, Canadian law grants domestic broadcast stations the right to require that these signals be [[Simultaneous substitution|substituted with their own]] if they are carrying the same program in simulcast with a U.S. station (\"simsub\"). This policy is intended to help protect Canadian advertising revenue from being lost to viewers watching via U.S. feeds of a program. In 2016, as part of a larger series of regulatory reforms, the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]] (CRTC) banned the Super Bowl from being substituted under these circumstances, meaning that the telecast on [[CTV Television|CTV]]\u2014a simulcast of the U.S. telecast with Canadian advertising inserted, would co-exist with feeds of the game from U.S. network affiliates. The CRTC cited dissatisfaction surrounding the practice from Canadian viewers\u2014particularly the unavailability of the U.S. [[Super Bowl commercials|commercials]], which the CRTC cited as being an \"integral part\" of the game based on this reception, but also other technical problems caused by poorly implemented simsubs (such as reduced quality and missing content due to mistimed transitions back into the U.S. program feed).<ref name=gandm-bellappeal/><ref name=gandm-nomoresuperbowlsimsub>{{cite news|title=CRTC opens door for U.S. Super Bowl ads to air on Canadian TV|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/industry-news/marketing/crtc-opens-door-for-us-super-bowl-ads-to-air-on-canadian-tv/article22696212/|newspaper=[[The Globe and Mail]]|date=January 29, 2015|accessdate=January 29, 2015}}</ref><ref name=crtc-2015-25>{{cite web|title=Broadcasting Regulatory Policy CRTC 2015-25|url=http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/2015/2015-25.htm|publisher=Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission|accessdate=February 3, 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe NFL's Canadian rights holder [[Bell Media]], as well as the league itself, have displayed objections to the policy; Bell felt that the decision devalued its exclusive Canadian rights to the game, and violated Canada's [[Broadcasting Act (1991)|Broadcasting Act]], which forbids the \"making of regulations singling out a particular program or licensee.\"<ref name=gandm-bellappeal>{{cite news|title=Bell appeals CRTC decision to air U.S. Super Bowl commercials|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/bell-to-fight-crtc-ruling-on-super-bowl-simsub/article23244271/|accessdate=March 12, 2015|work=[[The Globe and Mail]]|location=Toronto|date=March 2, 2015}}</ref> On November 2, 2016, Bell was granted the right to challenge the ruling in the [[Federal Court of Appeal (Canada)|Federal Court of Appeal]].<ref name=\"gandm-bellwinappeal\">{{cite news|title=Bell wins right to appeal new Super Bowl ad policy|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/bell-wins-right-to-appeal-new-super-bowl-ad-policy/article32643801/|website=The Globe and Mail|accessdate=November 2, 2016}}</ref> Bell, the NFL, and government representatives from both Canada and the U.S., have lobbied the CRTC for the rule to be retracted.<ref name=\"bloomberg-blitzes\">{{cite web|title=NFL Blitzes Trudeau in Arcane Super Bowl Advertising Dispute|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-01-09/nfl-blitzes-trudeau-in-arcane-super-bowl-advertising-dispute|website=Bloomberg|accessdate=January 18, 2017}}</ref> However, court action on the ruling was not taken in time for the game, meaning that it was in effect for the first time during Super Bowl LI.<ref name=\"gandm-cdnratings\">{{cite news|title=Bell\u2019s Super Bowl ratings drop 39 per cent as CRTC ad policy takes effect|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/bells-super-bowl-ratings-drop-39-per-cent-as-ad-policy-takes-effect/article33919635/|website=The Globe and Mail|accessdate=February 7, 2017}}</ref> Bell Media cited the decision, among other factors, as justification for a planned series of layoffs it announced on January 31, 2017.<ref name=\"fp-belllayoffs17\">{{cite web|last1=Jackson|first1=Emily|title=Bell Media cites CRTC Super Bowl ad policy as a factor in latest round of layoffs|url=http://business.financialpost.com/fp-tech-desk/bell-media-cites-crtc-super-bowl-ad-policy-in-latest-round-of-layoffs|website=Financial Post|accessdate=February 1, 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe simsub prohibition only applied to the game itself, and not pre-game or post-game programming (which was simulcast with Fox and subject to simsub).

The longest play from scrimmage was a 37-yard carry by Falcons running back [[Devonta Freeman]], which did not lead to any points, though it would be the longest run of the game for either team.\n\nOn the first play of the second quarter, New England's quarterback [[Tom Brady]] completed a 27-yard pass to wide receiver [[Julian Edelman]] on the Falcons 33-yard line. But on the next play, linebacker [[Deion Jones]] stripped the ball from running back [[LeGarrette Blount]]; the fumble was recovered by defensive back [[Robert Alford (American football)|Robert Alford]] on the 29-yard line. On the next two plays, [[Matt Ryan (American football)|Matt Ryan]] completed passes to [[Julio Jones]] for gains of 19 and 23 yards. Freeman ran the ball on the next three plays, covering the remaining 29 yards to the end zone, with the last carry being a 5-yard touchdown run that put Atlanta on the board with a 7\u20130 lead.\n\nNew England failed to get a first down on the series following the Freeman score, and the Falcons moved the ball 62 yards in five plays. Ryan started the drive with a 24-yard completion to [[Taylor Gabriel]], then completed a pass to Jones for an 18-yard gain. On 3rd-and-9, he threw a 19-yard touchdown pass to tight end [[Austin Hooper]], giving the Falcons a 14\u20130 lead. It was the largest deficit Brady had ever faced in his seven Super Bowl appearances, and it would soon grow larger.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/B/BradTo00.htm|title=Tom Brady Stats - Pro-Football-Reference.com|publisher=}}</ref> New England responded with a drive to the Falcons 23, aided by three defensive holding penalties against the Atlanta defense, each one giving them a first down on a third down play. However, on 3rd-and-6, Brady threw a pass that was intercepted by Alford and returned 82 yards for a touchdown, increasing Atlanta's lead to 21\u20130. It was the first time in his career that Brady had thrown a pick-six (interception returned for a touchdown) in his 33 postseason games,<ref>{{cite web|title=Can't-Miss Play: Tom Brady's first-ever playoff pick six goes to Robert Alford|url=http://www.nfl.com/videos/nfl-cant-miss-plays/0ap3000000783470/Can-t-Miss-Play-Brady-s-first-playoff-pick-six|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=NFL.com/Videos|date=February 5, 2017|access-date=February 6, 2017}}</ref> and Alford's 82 yard return was the second longest interception return in Super Bowl history.<ref>{{cite web|title=Super Bowl Records: Individual - Interceptions|url=http://www.nfl.com/superbowl/records/superbowls/player/ints|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=SuperBowl.com|access-date=September 25, 2019}}</ref> Brady ultimately became the first quarterback to win a Super Bowl in which he threw a pick-six. Getting the ball back with 2:20 left in the second quarter, Brady completed a 15-yard pass to [[Martellus Bennett]], and then a short pass to running back [[James White (running back)|James White]], who took off for a 28-yard gain. The drive stalled at the Falcons 20-yard line, but [[Stephen Gostkowski]] successfully made a field goal with two seconds left on the clock to send the teams into their locker rooms with the score 21\u20133.\n\n===Second half===\n\nNew England had an early third quarter scoring opportunity when Edelman returned a punt 26 yards to the Patriots' 47-yard line, but they could not gain a first down on the drive. Following the Patriots' punt, the Falcons started their drive on their own 15-yard line; Ryan completed two long passes to wide receiver Taylor Gabriel for gains of 17 and 35 yards to bring the ball to the New England 28-yard line. Four plays later, Ryan finished the 85-yard drive with a 6-yard touchdown pass to running back [[Tevin Coleman]], giving the Falcons a 28\u20133 lead with 8:31 left in the quarter. On the next series, Brady led the Patriots 75 yards in 13 plays for a responding touchdown, completing five of seven passes for 43 yards, the biggest a 17-yard completion to [[Danny Amendola]] on 4th-and-3 from the New England 46-yard line. Brady also made a big play by helping his own cause, rushing for a 15-yard gain (which would be the longest rushing play by the Patriots on the day) on 3rd-and-8 from the Atlanta 35-yard line. Three subsequent carries by Blount moved the ball 15 yards to the 5-yard line, and then Brady threw the ball to White for a touchdown, but Gostkowski missed an extra point as the attempt struck the goalpost, thereby sending the score to 28\u20139.\n\nNew England then attempted an [[onside kick]], but the ball was recovered by Falcons linebacker [[LaRoy Reynolds]], and a penalty against Gostkowski for touching the ball before it went ten yards, gave Atlanta even better field position. Ryan completed a 9-yard pass to Hooper to the Patriots 32-yard-line, but on the next play, a holding penalty on Atlanta offensive lineman [[Jake Matthews (American football)|Jake Matthews]] pushed the team back ten yards. Then, after an incompletion, [[Trey Flowers]] and [[Kyle Van Noy]] shared a sack on Ryan that effectively forced the Falcons to punt on the first play of the fourth quarter.\n\n[[Matt Bosher]]'s 42-yard punt pinned the Patriots back on their own 13-yard line. Brady led the next drive down the field, completing three passes to wide receiver [[Malcolm Mitchell]] for 40 yards and one to Bennett for 25 to bring the ball to the Falcons 7-yard line. However, Brady was sacked twice by defensive tackle [[Grady Jarrett]] over the next three plays. The Patriots had to settle for a field goal, where Gostkowski attempted a 33-yard field goal, which was good, and it cut their deficit to two scores, 28\u201312, with less than 10 minutes left in the game. Atlanta had burned two of their three time outs on defense and equipment malfunction.\n\nOn the third play of Atlanta's ensuing drive, Freeman missed his blocking assignment on a New England blitz that allowed linebacker [[Dont'a Hightower]] to sack Ryan as he was winding up for a pass, resulting in a fumble that was recovered by defensive tackle [[Alan Branch]] on the Falcons 25-yard line. It was Ryan's first turnover in two months.<ref name=\"Gagnon\"/> New England soon cashed in their scoring opportunity, with Brady throwing a 6-yard touchdown pass to Amendola. Then White took a direct snap in for a two-point conversion to make the score 28\u201320 in favor of Atlanta with 5:56 left on the clock. The Patriots had run the same play for a two-point conversion with [[Kevin Faulk]] in their [[Super Bowl XXXVIII]] victory.\n\nOn the first play of Atlanta's next possession, Freeman caught a short pass from Ryan and ran it for a 39-yard gain, the longest play of the game for either team. Then on 2nd-and-9 from the Patriots 49-yard line, Ryan threw a deep pass to Jones, who made an acrobatic catch at the right sideline for a 27-yard gain, giving the Falcons a first down on the Patriots 22-yard line with 4:40 left on the clock and a chance for a late-game two-score lead that would have clinched the game.<ref>{{cite AV media|people=|date=February 5, 2017|title=Julio Jones Unreal Sideline Catch! \u2013 Patriots vs. Falcons \u2013 Super Bowl LI Highlights|medium=[[YouTube]]|language=English|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FSirjCbbP1c|access-date=September 27, 2019|location=Houston|publisher=[[National Football League]]}}</ref> On the next play, Freeman ran for a 1-yard loss on a tackle by [[Devin McCourty]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Brooks|first=Bucky|title=Super Bowl LI explained: How Patriots pulled off epic comeback|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000784357/article/super-bowl-li-explained-how-patriots-pulled-off-epic-comeback|publisher=NFL Enterprises, LLC|website=NFL.com|date=February 7, 2017|access-date=September 25, 2019}}</ref> Atlanta tried to pass the ball on second down, but Flowers sacked Ryan for a 12-yard loss on the Patriots 35-yard line. Ryan then completed a 9-yard pass to [[Mohamed Sanu]] on 3rd-and 23, but this was nullified due to an offensive holding penalty on Matthews. Now out of field goal range and faced with 3rd-and-33 from the New England 45-yard line, Ryan threw an incomplete pass, and the team was left with no good choice but to punt the ball to New England.<ref name=\"Gagnon\"/>\n\nBosher's 36-yard kick gave the Patriots the ball on their own 9-yard line with 3:30 left on the clock and two of their timeouts left. After two incompletions, Brady picked up a first down with a 16-yard pass to [[Chris Hogan (American football)|Chris Hogan]]. After an 11-yard pass to Mitchell, Brady threw a pass that was nearly intercepted by Alford. Instead, he batted the ball in the air, and it fell into the arms of Edelman, who made a diving catch as it bounced off Alford's shoe. Edelman just barely managed to get his hands under the ball before it hit the ground, securing the football for what would be ruled as a 23-yard pass completion. Atlanta challenged the on-field ruling, but referee [[Carl Cheffers]] announced that the call stood, and Atlanta was charged with their final timeout.<ref>{{cite AV media|people=|date=February 5, 2017|title=Julian Edelman Makes Ridiculous Catch! \u2013 Patriots vs. Falcons \u2013 Super Bowl LI Highlights|medium=[[YouTube]]|language=English|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4SiUNdkIwzQ|access-date=September 27, 2019|location=Houston|publisher=[[National Football League]]}}</ref> Brady's next pass to Amendola gained 20 yards to the Falcons' 21-yard line as the clock ran down below the two-minute warning. Two more passes to White gained 20 yards and gave New England a first down at the 1-yard line. With 58 seconds left, White scored on a 1-yard touchdown run, and Brady completed a 2-point conversion pass to Amendola, tying the score at 28 points a piece, thereby coming back from a 25-point deficit.\n\nWith the hopes of winning their first championship on the line, Atlanta started their drive deep in their own end with just under a minute and no time outs. The Falcons failed to get in range to score a possible game-winning field goal and punted, with the Patriots fair catching the ball at their own 35-yard line. The Patriots considered, but ultimately declined, ending regulation on what would have been the first [[fair catch kick]] ever attempted in a Super Bowl.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.boston.com/sports/new-england-patriots/2017/02/06/bill-belichick-passed-up-an-opportunity-to-end-super-bowl-51-in-the-weirdest-possible-way|title=Bill Belichick passed up an opportunity to end Super Bowl 51 in the weirdest possible way|first=Nick|last=DeCosta-Klipa|work=The Boston Globe|date=February 7, 2017|accessdate=February 7, 2017}}</ref> Instead, New England attempted a fake [[quarterback kneel]] running play for [[Dion Lewis]], who gained several yards but failed to score, ending the fourth quarter and forcing the game into overtime, the first time this had happened in the Super Bowl era, and the first in the NFL title game since the [[1958 NFL Championship Game|1958 meeting]] between the [[1958 Baltimore Colts season|Baltimore Colts]] and the [[1958 New York Giants season|New York Giants]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Bowden|first1=Mark|title=The Best Game Ever: Giants vs. Colts, 1958, and the Birth of the Modern NFL|date=2008|publisher=Atlantic Monthly Press|isbn=978-0-87113-988-7|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/bestgameevergian00bowd}}</ref>\n\n===Overtime===\nThe Patriots won the coin toss to start overtime, and elected to receive the ball.
