Several complaints have been made against him to the [[Canadian Broadcast Standards Council]] (CBSC). In a 1994 complaint to the CBSC, listeners alleged that Green had been rude and abusive to a caller who identified herself as a Christian. Although the CBSC determined that Green's conduct had contravened its guidelines on discrimination, it also decided that the station had responded appropriately, and the group did not prescribe any further action. In 2006 and 2008, the council censured Green for his treatment of a Muslim man who challenged Green on the way the radio show host portrays Islam.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2009/090206a.php|title=Archived copy|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101121203806/http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2009/090206a.php|archivedate=21 November 2010|accessdate=2010-11-30|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2006/061215.php|title=Archived copy|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008202250/http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2006/061215.php|archivedate=8 October 2011|accessdate=2009-08-07|df=dmy-all}}</ref>  In June 2017, there was controversy as to whether [[Indigo Books and Music]] had pulled Green's latest book, ''Amazing But True!'', from its bookshelves in stores in Canada.<ref>{{cite news|last=Johnston|first=Geoffrey|url=http://www.thewhig.com/2017/06/01/author-battles-censorship|title=Author battles 'censorship'|date=1 June 2017|newspaper=The Kingston Whig-Standard|accessdate=12 July 2017}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://www.facebook.com/lgreen.ca/ Lowell Green at Facebook]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20090212100107/http://cbsc.ca/english/decisions/1994/940604.php 1994 decision]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20111008202250/http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2006/061215.php 2006 decision]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20101121203806/http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2009/090206a.php 2009 decision]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Green, Lowell}}\n[[Category:1936 births]]\n[[Category:Canadian non-fiction writers]]\n[[Category:Canadian people of Irish descent]]\n[[Category:Canadian talk radio hosts]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:McGill University alumni]]\n[[Category:Ontario Liberal Party candidates in Ontario provincial elections]]\n[[Category:Writers from Ann Arbor, Michigan]]\n[[Category:Writers from Ottawa]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Canadian radio personality}}\n{{Use Canadian English|date=February 2013}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=July 2013}}\n{{Infobox presenter\n|name        = Lowell Green\n|alias       = \n|image       = Lowell Green.jpg|<nowiki>Lowell Green]]</nowiki>\n|image_size  = \n|caption     = \n|birth_name  = \n|birth_date  = {{Birth date and age|df=yes|1936|07|07}}\n|birth_place = [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]], [[USA]]\n|death_date  = \n|death_place = \n|show        = ''The Lowell Green Show''\n|station     = [[CFRA (AM)|CFRA]] Ottawa\n|timeslot    = Weekdays 10 am to 12pm\n|show2       = \n|station2    = \n|timeslot2   = \n|style       = [[Talk radio]]\n|country     = Canada\n|prevshow    = Greenline\n|website     = \n|spouse      = Deborah Green\n|awards      = }}\n\n'''Lowell Green''' (born 7 July 1936) is a Canadian radio personality, journalist, and author, best known as the host of ''The Lowell Green Show'', a conservative morning [[talk show]] that aired on the [[Ottawa]] [[Ontario]] radio station [[CFRA]].

Several complaints have been made against him to the [[Canadian Broadcast Standards Council]] (CBSC). In a 1994 complaint to the CBSC, listeners alleged that Green had been rude and abusive to a caller who identified herself as a Christian. Although the CBSC determined that Green's conduct had contravened its guidelines on discrimination, it also decided that the station had responded appropriately, and the group did not prescribe any further action. In 2006 and 2008, the council censured Green for his treatment of a Muslim man who challenged Green on the way the radio show host portrays Islam.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2009/090206a.php|title=Archived copy|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101121203806/http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2009/090206a.php|archivedate=21 November 2010|accessdate=2010-11-30|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2006/061215.php|title=Archived copy|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111008202250/http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2006/061215.php|archivedate=8 October 2011|accessdate=2009-08-07|df=dmy-all}}</ref>  In June 2017, there was controversy as to whether [[Indigo Books and Music]] had pulled Green's latest book, ''Amazing But True!'', from its bookshelves in stores in Canada.<ref>{{cite news|last=Johnston|first=Geoffrey|url=http://www.thewhig.com/2017/06/01/author-battles-censorship|title=Author battles 'censorship'|date=1 June 2017|newspaper=The Kingston Whig-Standard|accessdate=12 July 2017}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[https://www.facebook.com/lgreen.ca/ Lowell Green at Facebook]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20090212100107/http://cbsc.ca/english/decisions/1994/940604.php 1994 decision]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20111008202250/http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2006/061215.php 2006 decision]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20101121203806/http://www.cbsc.ca/english/decisions/2009/090206a.php 2009 decision]\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Green, Lowell}}\n[[Category:1936 births]]\n[[Category:Canadian non-fiction writers]]\n[[Category:Canadian people of Irish descent]]\n[[Category:Canadian talk radio hosts]]\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:McGill University alumni]]\n[[Category:Ontario Liberal Party candidates in Ontario provincial elections]]\n[[Category:Writers from Ann Arbor, Michigan]]\n[[Category:Writers from Ottawa]]\n", "name_user": "WildStar", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eAccomplishments", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lowell_Green"}

Within the [[Donald Duck universe]], the clan is related to the American [[Duck family (Disney)|Duck family]] through the marriage of Hortense McDuck and Quackmore Duck, [[Donald Duck|Donald]]'s parents.\n\nClan McDuck was created by American comic book author [[Carl Barks]], who also created the character of Scrooge McDuck. Barks' 1948 story \"[[The Old Castle's Secret]],\" in which Scrooge and his nephews search for hidden treasure in McDuck Castle, introduced the backstory of the clan. Other authors built on Barks' work, most notably [[Don Rosa]] in his 12-part comic saga ''[[The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck]]'' (1992\u201394) which introduced Scrooge's immediate family.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Literary origins ==\n{{Image frame|width=307|content=[[Image:Carl barks.jpg|150px]][[File:Don Rosa in Helsinki 2008.JPG|157px]]|caption=[[Carl Barks]] (left) and [[Don Rosa]] (right)|link=|align=right}}\n\nIn the early 1950s, Carl Barks was in his second decade of creating comic book stories starring Donald Duck and his various relatives. He had personally created several of the latter, including cousin [[Duck family (Disney)#Gladstone Gander|Gladstone Gander]] and uncle Scrooge McDuck, although the specific relationships between them were still uncertain. To better define these relationships, Barks created a version of the McDuck/Duck/Coot [[family tree]] for his own personal benefit, incidentally creating several additional characters.\n\nDuring his retirement, Barks' stories remained popular and gained him unexpected fame. Barks gave several interviews during which he answered questions about his stories and the characters he had created. In 1981, Barks described his personal version of Donald's family tree, which was used by amateur artist Mark Worden in drawing the family tree and including portraits of the characters mentioned. Worden's tree was first published in several [[fanzine]]s, and later in the Disney-licensed ''[[Carl Barks Library]]'', a ten-volume hardcover collection of Barks' stories in black-and-white.\n\nIn 1987, Don Rosa, a long-time fan of Carl Barks and a personal friend of Mark Worden, started creating his own stories featuring Scrooge McDuck. His stories contained numerous references to older stories by Barks as well as several original ideas. After several years he gained a fan base of his own. In the early 1990s, the [[Egmont Group]], the publishing house employing Rosa, offered him an ambitious assignment: he was to create the definitive version of Scrooge's biography and a family tree to accompany it. The project was intended to end decades of contradictions between stories which caused confusion to readers. The project was to become ''[[The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck]]''. The family tree accompanying it was first published in [[Norway]] on July 3, 1993.\n\nIn the process of working on Scrooge's biography, Rosa studied Barks' old stories in detail. Rosa made note of as many clues as he could of Scrooge's past given by Barks \u2013 which Rosa dubbed \"Barksian facts\" \u2013 and used them to write new stories. Despite the ambitious nature of the project, Rosa himself stressed in the introduction to the book \"...this version of Scrooge's life is not the 'official' version \u2013 there's no particular reason why I (or anyone else) should expect other Duck writers to adhere to my vision of Scrooge's history. As carefully and authentically as I sought to construct it, it was never intended to be anything but my personal telling of the life of Scrooge McDuck.\"<ref>{{cite book | last = Rosa | first = Don | authorlink = Don Rosa | title = [[The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck]]: Volume One | year = 2009 | publisher = [[Boom!

The nearest village is the fictional MacDuich. The castle usually appears in good condition considering its great age. However, in the Barks story \"Hound of the Whiskervilles\" (1960) the castle is in ruins.\n\nThe comics continuity does not establish when McDuck Castle was built, but it first appears (on the fictional timeline) in 946 when the [[Saxons]] laid siege to it. For many centuries the castle served as the home of the [[Scottish clan chief|clan chief]]. In 1675, the McDucks were run out of the castle due to the depredations of a \"monstrous [[Black dog (ghost)|devil dog]]\" in Dismal Downs, later discovered to be a plot by the rival Clan Whiskerville.<ref name=\"Last\">{{cite book\n| last1 = Rosa\n| first1 = Don\n| author-link1 = Don Rosa\n| year = 2009\n| chapter = [[The Last of the Clan McDuck]]\n| title = [[The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck]]\n| volume = 1\n| location = Los Angeles\n| publisher = [[Boom!

By 1885, only Fergus and Jake McDuck remain to pay the taxes, but their combined income is not enough, causing [[the Crown]] to auction it off.

This story would date the castle itself to about the 18th century. The Druids, seeking revenge on the McDucks for taking away their sacred meeting place, scared the clan away using trained phosphorescent hounds. Years later, Scrooge returns with Huey, Dewey, Louie, and Webby and uncovers the mystery. Scrooge befriends the Druids and partners with them to turn Castle McDuck into a tourist attraction. Scrooge plans to give a share of the profit to the Druids as [[Reparations (transitional justice)|reparations]] for desecrating their stone circle. The story is loosely based on the Barks story \"Hound of the Whiskervilles\", which was in turn loosely based on ''[[The Hound of the Baskervilles]]''.<ref>{{Cite episode| title =The Curse of Castle McDuck| episodelink=List of DuckTales episodes#Season 1 (1987\u20131988)| series =DuckTales| serieslink =DuckTales| date =19 October 1987| season =1| number =26}}</ref> In the [[DuckTales (2017 TV series)|2017 ''DuckTales'' series]], the castle is Clan McDuck's ancestral home, as in the comics, and is protected by the spirits of the McDuck ancestors buried there.

Other comic book authors have also used the castle, such as Andrew Galton, Dave Angus, and [[Vicar (cartoonist)|Vicar]] in ''The Crying Monster'' (1982). In the 1987 TV series ''[[DuckTales]]'', McDuck Castle appears in the episode [[List of DuckTales episodes#Season 1 (1987\u20131988)|\"The Curse of Castle McDuck\"]].

However, the coloring of the tartan was not Barks' decision but that of [[colorist]]s working for [[Dell Comics]], which first published the story; subsequent publications showed the tartan having differing colors.

A young King Khan Khan (2050 BC-1967 AD) sacked the city of Sagbad in 2033 BC, but Scrooge Shah and '''Prince Donduk''', his heir apparent, managed to escape. Khan Khan lost their tracks, but would much later locate their distant descendants. Scrooge Shah features in the story \"King Scrooge the First\" (1967) by [[Carl Barks]] and [[Tony Strobl]].\n\n==Postclassical McDucks ==\n=== Eider McDuck ===\n'''Sir Eider McDuck''' (880-946; from earlier Eider MacDuich) was the [[Scottish clan chief|chief]] of Clan McDuck during an [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] invasion in 946 (despite England and Scotland signing a peace treaty in 945).

That same year, Macbeth offered Quackly a treasure chest in exchange for his support in the ongoing war for the throne. Quackly agreed and served the king during the war, but became obsessed with protecting the treasure, eventually trapping himself inside the castle walls with it. Quackly and his treasure became a McDuck legend, and it is believed that his ghost continues to protect the treasure and the castle.<ref name=\"castle\"/>\n\nIn 1877, Quackly's ghost saves a young Scrooge McDuck from the Whiskervilles of Dismal Downs. Without revealing his true identity, he suggests to Scrooge that he travel to America and work for his Uncle Pothole, thus serving as the catalyst for all of Scrooge's adventures. In 1885, Quackly again tries to save Scrooge, but his action unintentionally brings about Scrooge's temporary death. In heaven, Quackly is reprimanded by his relatives for interfering in earthly events.<ref name=\"Rosa\"/><ref name=\"LoS1\"/> Quackly McDuck is first mentioned in ''The Old Castle's Secret'' (1948) by Carl Barks, and first appears in ''[[The Last of the Clan McDuck]]'' (1994) by Don Rosa.\n\n=== Murdoch McDuck ===\n'''Sir Murdoch McDuck''' (?-1066; from earlier Murdoch MacDuich) was a businessman who patented the longbow. Most notably in 1066, when the Normans invaded England, he had the latter sign a contract with him so they would have enough longbows to fight off the invaders. However, they did not have enough arrows as Sir Murdoch charged extra for them. He is also the last of the Dark Ages McDucks and the one who modernized their family name \"MacDuich\" to the more familiar \"McDuck\". He only appears in the unfinished sketch-only story \"The History of the Clan McDuck\" (written and drawn approx. in 1992 by Don Rosa, but not released until December 2011), which was meant to serve as a prologue to \"The Last of the Clan McDuck\" before it was scrapped.\n\nIn the [[DuckTales (2017 TV series)|2017 ''DuckTales'' series]] episode, \"The Secret(s) of Castle McDuck!\", Downy McDuck relates Murdoch's history (which remains intact) to [[Huey, Dewey, and Louie Duck]], and [[Webby Vanderquack]]. His longbow is later used as a clue that the boys use to uncover the mystery behind their mother, [[Della Duck|Della]]'s, disappearance.\n\n=== Stuft McDuck ===\n'''Sir Stuft McDuck''' (1110-1175) was a successful chief of Clan McDuck who oversaw a period of prosperity.<ref name=\"Rosa\"/>\n\n=== Roast McDuck ===\n'''Sir Roast McDuck''' (1159-1205) succeeded his father, Stuft McDuck, as clan chief, while Clan McDuck was one of the richest clans in Scotland. However, in 1189, Roast offered much of the clan's wealth to the king of Scotland, [[William the Lion]], after William asked for his help in paying tribute to [[Richard I of England]]. This act of patriotic generosity led to financial ruin for the clan. Aside from this imprudence, Roast is primarily remembered for his gluttony. In 1205, he raided the king's pantry and ate himself to death. Roast's memorial suit of armor displayed in Castle McDuck holds a knife and fork in its hands.<ref name=\"castle\"/><ref name=\"LoS1\">[[Don Rosa]]: \"The Last of the Clan McDuck\" (part 1 of ''[[The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck]]'').

He has a small speaking role in ''[[The Last of the Clan McDuck]]'' (1994), but makes his first appearance in ''[[The New Laird of Castle McDuck]]''.\n\nHis ghost makes a cameo appearance in the [[DuckTales (2017 TV series)|2017 ''DuckTales'' series]] episode, \"The Secret(s) of Castle McDuck!\"\n\n=== Swamphole McDuck ===\n'''Sir Swamphole McDuck''' (1190-1260)<ref>Sir Swamphole McDuck's life span is seen on his grave stone as 1161-1221 in the Carl Barks painting ''Dubious Doings at Dismal Downs''.</ref> succeeded his father, Roast McDuck, as clan chief and inherited its financial problems. In 1220, Swamphole sealed the dungeon of Castle McDuck, which he claimed was an attempt to decrease maintenance costs. He did, however, create secret passageways in the castle leading to the dungeons. (These passageways would later be useful during subsequent sieges.) After his death in 1260, Swamphole was not buried in the clan cemetery; rather, his skeleton was placed inside his memorial suit of armor, which was placed in Castle McDuck. Swamphole McDuck is first mentioned in ''The Old Castle's Secret'' by Carl Barks.<ref name=\"castle\"/> In ''[[The Old Castle's Other Secret or A Letter from Home]]'' (2004) by Don Rosa, it is revealed that Swamphole sealed the dungeons not to reduce maintenance costs, but to conceal a treasure.\n\nIn the [[DuckTales (2017 TV series)|2017 ''DuckTales'' series]] episode, \"The Secret(s) of Castle McDuck!\", he is stated to be a treasure hunter (like Scrooge) who constructed secret passageways underneath Castle McDuck and let loose a demon dog to protect his treasure. His ghost later appears to ward off said demon dog alongside the ghosts of several of his family members.\n\n=== Donald McDuck ===\n'''Sir Donald McDuck''', nicknamed \"'''[[Black Donald]]'''\" because of his foul temper, is said to have invented [[golf]], the [[hammer throw]], and the [[caber toss]] in 1440. His temper while playing golf resulted in [[James II of Scotland]] outlawing the sport. Black Donald is mentioned in \"The History of the Clan McDuck\" by Don Rosa.\n\nIn the [[DuckTales (2017 TV series)|2017 ''DuckTales'' series]] episode \"The Missing Links of Moorshire!\", Scrooge McDuck relates the story of how \"Black Donald\" McDuck invented golf and subsequently got it banned due to his temper to Dewey, Louie, and Webby before participating in a golf tournament in Scotland.\n\n=== Simon McDuck ===\n'''Sir Simon McDuck''' (1437-1509) was the treasurer of the [[Knights Templar]] and hid their treasure beneath McDuck Castle. He is mentioned in ''The Old Castle's Other Secret or A Letter from Home'' (2004) by Don Rosa.\n\nIn the [[DuckTales (2017 TV series)|2017 ''DuckTales'' series]] episode, \"The Secret(s) of Castle McDuck\", Scrooge McDuck states Simon was the \"accountant\" to the Knights Templar who had stolen and hidden their treasure somewhere underneath Castle McDuck, and he had returned to his father Fergus to reluctantly ask for his help in finding it since he knows where it is. His ghost appears later in the episode to stop a ghost hound from attacking Scrooge's grandnephews, Huey, Dewey, and Louie.\n\n== Early modern McDucks ==\n=== Malcolm McDuck ===\n'''Malcolm \"Matey\" McDuck''' (1530-1564?) was a McDuck relative who settled in [[England]] and is suggested to be a previous incarnation of Scrooge McDuck. Malcolm served in the [[Royal Navy|English Navy]], and in 1563 he became first mate of the frigate HMS ''Falcon Rover'', serving under Captain Loyal Hawk. The ''Falcon Rover'' raided Spanish targets in the [[Caribbean Sea]] between 1563 and 1564. Also serving on the ''Falcon Rover'' was the boatswain, [[Duck family (Disney)#Pintail Duck|Pintail Duck]], an ancestor of Donald Duck.\n\nMalcolm is said to have lost his life on 9 December 1564 when the Spanish fleet sunk the HMS ''Falcon Rover''.

Sometime after 1707, he became an associate of Scottish outlaw [[Rob Roy MacGregor]] who is characterized as a [[Gentleman thief|noble thief]] who would \"rob from the rich to give to the poor\". Locksley's alliance with MacGregor would come to an end after Locksley was unable to \"give to the poor\" after having robbed the rich. He is mentioned in ''The History of The Clan McDuck'' by Don Rosa. His name is derived from the English village of [[Loxley, South Yorkshire|Loxley]], the traditional birthplace of [[Robin Hood]].\n\n=== Hugh McDuck ===\n'''Captain Hugh \"Seafoam\" McDuck''' (1710-1776) was a McDuck relative who settled in [[Glasgow]] in 1727, as the clan had been driven from their ancestral home of Dismal Downs in 1675. Hugh turned to the sea for a living and became a successful merchant. He obtained his own ship, the ''Golden Goose'', and became known by the nickname \"Seafoam\".\n\nIn 1753, Seafoam McDuck signed a contract with [[List of Donald Duck universe characters#Chisel McSue|Swindle McSue]] to deliver a cargo of [[horseradish]] to [[Jamaica]]. But McSue sabotaged the ''Golden Goose'' and the ship sank before reaching Jamaica. Upon returning to Scotland, Seafoam McDuck learned that his contract with McSue contained fine print stating that if the shipment was not completed, McDuck would forfeit all his possessions to McSue. Seafoam escaped with nothing but the clothes on his back, a silver pocket watch, and the golden dentures in his mouth.<ref name=\"horseradish\">[[Carl Barks]]: Untitled Uncle Scrooge story, later known as \"The Horseradish Story\".

He appeared in Don Rosa's illustrated family tree, but has not appeared in any comic book stories. A 1960s story by [[Bob Gregory (comics)|Bob Gregory]] and [[Tony Strobl]] identifies Scrooge's grandfather as '''Titus McDuck'''.\n\nIn the [[DuckTales (2017 TV series)|2017 ''DuckTales'' series]] episode, \"The Secret(s) of Castle McDuck\", Dingus is revealed to have had an antagonistic relationship with his son, Fergus (not unlike that of the latter and his son, Scrooge). In fact, knowing he would seek out Simon McDuck's treasure, he left his son a note telling him to work hard and not accept hand-outs inside a hidden chamber underneath Castle McDuck.\n\n=== Molly Mallard ===\n'''Molly Mallard''' was the wife of Dingus McDuck and the mother of Angus, Fergus, and Jake McDuck. Her first and only appearance was in an illustrated family tree created by Don Rosa; she has not appeared in any stories. Coincidentally, her maiden name is the same as the title character of ''[[Darkwing Duck]].''<br>\n\nHer ghost makes a cameo appearance in the [[DuckTales (2017 TV series)|2017 ''DuckTales'' series]]' episode, \"The Secret(s) of Castle McDuck!\"\n\n=== Quagmire McDuck ===\n'''Quagmire McDuck''' was Dingus McDuck's brother and Scrooge McDuck's great uncle. He inherited a silver watch from his ancestor Hugh \"Seafoam\" McDuck and passed it on to his nephew Fergus. After his death, Quagmire's estate remained unclaimed. Quagmire appears in the Carl Barks story \"The Heirloom Watch\" (1955).<ref>[[Carl Barks]]: \"The Heirloom Watch\".

Around the time of the [[American Civil War]] (1861\u20131865) he became quite successful as a river boater. Soon after the end of the war in 1865 he and fellow river boater [[List of Donald Duck universe characters#Porker Hogg|Porker Hogg]] became the co-owners of Cornpone Gables, a [[plantations in the American South|Southern plantation]] that had gone bankrupt. The two were unable to settle their differences and they decided to have a riverboat race in 1870 to decide who would be the owner. Both riverboats sank. Porker had two more riverboats but Angus spent the next ten years as a professional card player.\n\nIn 1880, in a poker game with Porker, Angus won the rights to one of his rival's riverboats, named ''Dilly Dollar''. Porker soon lost his other riverboat to Blackheart Beagle and his sons, the first generation of the [[Beagle Boys]], a family of outlaws, and retired. Angus on the other hand hired his nephew [[Scrooge McDuck]] and a penniless inventor named [[Gyro Gearloose#Ratchet Gearloose|Ratchet Gearloose]] as his crew. Business wasn't going well and Angus decided to retire in 1882. He left his riverboat to his nephew and settled down in [[New Orleans]].<ref name=\"LoS2\"/>\n\nHe became the writer of a series of [[dime novel]]s under the title ''The Master of Mississippi'', based on a highly exaggerated description of his life. His dime novels became very popular and to have more material to add he occasionally traveled through the country.<ref name=\"Bluff\">[[Don Rosa]]: \"The Vigilante of Pizen Bluff\".

After the show's money is stolen by the [[Dalton Gang]], Angus rides out with Bill, Scrooge, [[P. T. Barnum]], [[Annie Oakley]], and [[Geronimo]] to stop the bandits.<ref name=\"Bluff\"/>\n\nAngus' exact date of death is unknown.\n\nIn 1955, Porker's nephew, Horseshoe Hogg, and Scrooge McDuck would bring their uncles' [[steamboat]]s back to the surface to finish the race for Cornpone Gables. Scrooge won, only to learn that 85 years of disuse made the mansion so fragile that he accidentally destroyed it with a sneeze.\n\nA character obviously based on Angus, but called \"Catfish\" McDuck and voiced by [[Peter Renaday]], appears in the 1987 ''[[DuckTales]]'' episode, \"Once Upon a Dime.\"\n\n=== Fergus McDuck ===\n'''Fergus McDuck''' (1835\u20131902<ref name=\"LoS9\">[[Don Rosa]]: \"The Billionaire of Dismal Downs\" (part 9 of ''[[The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck]]'').

As such he is a prominent character in ''[[The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck]]''.\n\nHe was born in [[Glasgow]] in 1835 to Dingus McDuck and Molly Mallard, who were both working as coal miners at the time. He spent most of his life as a mill worker.<ref name=\"Rosa\"/>\n\nAccording to a story by [[William Van Horn]], Fergus at some point had a short marriage with an unidentified woman, with whom he had the son [[Clan McDuck#Rumpus McFowl|Rumpus McFowl]].<ref>[[William Van Horn]]: \"Secrets\".

In 1877 he encouraged his son to work to have his own money. Scrooge's obvious intelligence, skill at hard work and ambition made his father believe that Scrooge would be able to restore Clan McDuck to its former glory.<ref name=\"LoS1\"/> In the story ''Of Ducks, Dimes, and Destinies'', it is revealed that Scrooge's Number One Dime came from Fergus, who gave it to the man who used it to pay Scrooge for shining his shoes.\n\nIn 1885 the Clan's hereditary lands would have been seized due to Fergus' inability to pay his taxes. But Scrooge spent his savings at the time ($10,000) to pay the taxes and become the new owner of their lands.<ref name=\"LoS5\">[[Don Rosa]]: \"The New Laird of Castle McDuck\" (part 5 of ''[[The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck]]'').

The family continued to work to pay for the taxes and Scrooge sent them most all of the money he earned while traveling. Fergus became a widower in 1897.\n\nScrooge became rich in the [[Klondike, Yukon|Klondike]] and returned to Scotland in 1902 as a billionaire. Scrooge's intention was originally to settle in Dismal Downs but he quickly changed his mind and decided to settle in the United States. He wanted to take his family with him. His sisters accepted but Fergus decided to stay. He died during the night, aged 72, and was re-united with his wife Downy and the rest of the McDuck Clan as his three children left Scotland.<ref name=\"LoS9\"/>\n\nIn [[Don Rosa]]'s ''The Old Castle's Other Secret or A Letter from Home'', it's revealed that Fergus tried to find the [[Knights Templar]] treasure hidden in the castle McDuck by one of his ancestors, a Knight himself. Even though Fergus decided not to tell Scrooge about the treasure, he learns about it through other ways and, like [[Clan McDuck#Matilda McDuck|Matilda McDuck]], thinks Fergus kept the secret from him because he disapproved of Scrooge. In the middle of their way to the treasure, Scrooge, Matilda and Scrooge's nephews find a letter from Fergus, who believed Scrooge would eventually find it, revealing the reason he hid the secret from Scrooge is that Scrooge would feel better building his own fortune instead of inheriting one.<ref>[[Don Rosa]]: \"A Letter From Home\". First published 2004 ([http://coa.inducks.org/story.php?c=D+2003-081 I.N.D.U.C.K.S. entry])</ref>\n\nFergus appears in the classic 1987 ''[[DuckTales]]'' episode, \"Once Upon a Dime\", which explores Scrooge's history. Here he is referred to as \"McPapa.\" Fergus' name and image are also present in the 2017 ''[[DuckTales (2017 TV series)|DuckTales]]'' series, which draws heavily from the comics. He later appears (voiced by [[Graham McTavish]]) in the episode, \"The Secret(s) of Castle McDuck!\", having survived to the present day due to Scrooge rebuilding Castle McDuck using magic stones that granted his parents (and possibly Scrooge himself) immortality. Scrooge and Fergus' relationship is initially tense, with the latter expressing apparent disapproval of the former; though in reality, he was upset because Scrooge hadn't been a part of his life. They later reconcile after Fergus reveals he was the one who gave Scrooge his Number One Dime, via Burt the Ditch Digger, in order to give him the gift of \"self-reliance\" since he couldn't afford to buy him a proper gift.\n\nIn the 1993 [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] game ''[[DuckTales 2]]'', Scrooge and his nephews found a piece of a treasure map that led to the lost treasure of a character named Fergus McDuck. However, this Fergus is not Scrooge's father but Scrooge's great-great-uncle.\n\n=== Downy O'Drake ===\n'''Downy McDuck''' (n\u00e9e '''O'Drake'''; 1840\u20131897) is Scrooge McDuck's mother. She was created by Don Rosa and first appears in ''[[The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck]]''. She is of [[Irish people|Irish]] origin and was born in 1840.<ref name=\"LoS9\"/>\n\nShe was a very devoted [[housewife]] and mother. She settled in Castle McDuck at Dismal Downs, Clan McDuck's old castle, along with her family in 1885. She died in 1897,<ref name=\"LoS9\"/> and was buried in the McDucks' cemetery.<ref name=\"LoS9\"/> She later appeared to her husband Fergus at his own passing, and together they joined various McDuck ancestors.\n\nDowny's image and name are also present in the 2017 incarnation of ''DuckTales'', usually alongside those of her husband. Alongside Fergus, she makes a physical appearance in the episode, \"The Secret(s) of Castle McDuck!\", voiced by [[Ashley Jensen]].\n\n=== Jake McDuck ===\n'''Jake McDuck''' (1832\u2013?) is Scrooge McDuck's uncle. He was mentioned in the story \"[[A Christmas for Shacktown]]\" (1952) by [[Carl Barks]], in which [[Donald Duck]] dresses up as Jake in an attempt to trick Scrooge into giving money to charity.\n\nThe character was later used by [[Don Rosa]], and appears in three of twelve original chapters of Rosa's ''[[The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck]]''. He lived in the same house as his brother [[Fergus McDuck]] and helped Fergus and his wife [[Downy O'Drake]] to raise their children.<ref name=\"LoS1\"/> He settled in McDuck castle along with his brother in 1885.<ref name=\"LoS5\"/> However, it appears that by 1902, Jake was no longer living there.\n\nAccording to Rosa's sketches and timelines, Jake was born in 1832<ref name=\"Rosa\"/> to [[coal]] miners [[Dingus McDuck]] and [[Molly Mallard]], and grew up to become a stockyard hand in Glasgow. His date of death is unknown, but it appears that both Scrooge and Donald believed him to be alive in 1952.\n\n== Modern McDucks (3rd generation)==\n=== Rumpus McFowl ===\n'''Rumpus McFowl''' was created by [[William Van Horn]] and introduced as a lazy and greedy cousin of [[Scrooge McDuck]]. It was soon revealed that he was in fact Scrooge's half-brother, born during his mother's brief marriage to Fergus McDuck.\n\n=== Scrooge McDuck ===\n{{main|Scrooge McDuck}}\n'''Scrooge McDuck''' (1867, according to Don Rosa) is the first child of Fergus and Downy McDuck and is the protagonist of most stories involving the Clan McDuck. He does not marry and has no offspring of his own, although he does come to maintain close relationships with his nephew [[Donald Duck]] and his grandnephews [[Huey, Dewey, and Louie|Huey, Dewey, and Louie Duck]].\n\n=== Gideon McDuck ===\n[[File:GideonMcDuck.png|thumb|right|Gideon represented in an Italian-made picture, holding a copy of \"The Cricket\" (''Il Grillo Parlante'')]]\n'''Gideon McDuck''' (''Gedeone de' Paperoni'' in original Italian) is [[Scrooge McDuck]]'s moralistic brother, and is a recurring character in Italian comic stories; in those stories, Gideon is the editor of the [[newspaper]] \"The County Conscience\",<ref name=\"Gideon\">[[Romano Scarpa]]: \"Paperino e i gamberi in salm\u00ec\". First published 1956 ([http://coa.inducks.org/story.php?c=I+TL++132-AP I.N.D.U.C.K.S. entry])</ref> the most credible newspaper in [[Duckburg]]. The newspaper is originally known as \"Il Grillo Parlante\", which is the Italian name of the [[Pinocchio]] character [[The Talking Cricket]] and its Disney version [[Jiminy Cricket]]; a statue of Jiminy is therefore present in Gideon's office. Gideon also has an antagonistic relationship with his brother Scrooge.\n\nThe character was created by [[Romano Scarpa]], and first appeared in the story \"Paperino e i gamberi in salm\u00ec\" (1956).<ref name=\"Gideon\"/> The character's debut story is the only one that was printed in the United States, as it was published in 2015 under the title \"Shellfish Motives\".\n\nGideon's existence is inconsistent with a statement made in [[Carl Barks]]'s \"The Old Castle's Secret\".<ref name=\"castle\"/> In this story, Scrooge states that he is the last of [[the Clan McDuck]], which would mean that he couldn't have a living sibling. However, Gideon is not the only living relative of Scrooge to carry the surname \"McDuck\", and therefore cause the same inconsistency with Barks's story; others include his sister Matilda and first cousin Douglas. In the American translation of \"Shellfish Motives\" Gideon is said to be younger than Scrooge, while the original version doesn't specify which one of them is younger.\n\n=== Matilda McDuck ===\n'''Matilda McDuck''' (born 1871) is one of Scrooge McDuck's two sisters. She was first mentioned in Carl Barks' 1950s sketch for a [[Duck family (Disney)|Duck family]] tree, where she was shown to have adopted [[Duck family (Disney)#Gladstone Gander|Gladstone Gander]].<ref name=\"barkstree\">[http://goofy313g.free.fr/calisota_online/trees/ducktrees/barks.html Carl Barks' Duck Family Trees]</ref> The Matilda McDuck character was dropped in Barks' 1991 Duck Family Tree sketch (where Gladstone Gander is the biological grandson of [[Duck family (Disney)#Grandma Duck|Grandma Duck]] and not related to Scrooge), but [[Don Rosa]] picked up the name, and used Matilda McDuck as a prominent character in ''[[The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck]]''.\n\nMatilda McDuck was born in [[Glasgow]], Scotland, in 1871 to [[Clan McDuck#Fergus McDuck|Fergus McDuck]] and [[Clan McDuck#Downy O'Drake|Downy O'Drake]].<ref name=\"Rosa\"/> She is the younger sister of Scrooge McDuck. She has a younger sister named Hortense.\n\nIn contrast to Scrooge and Hortense's fiery tempers, she usually had a calm demeanor. In 1902 Scrooge returned to Scotland and took both of his sisters with him to go to America.<ref name=\"LoS9\"/> When he established his base in [[Donald Duck universe#Duckburg|Duckburg]], [[Donald Duck universe#Calisota|Calisota]], United States he left Matilda and Hortense to run his empire from 1902 to 1930. In the meantime he traveled the world expanding his financial empire. In 1930, a conflict with Scrooge ended all relationships between him and his family, and his sisters are believed to have left Duckburg.<ref name=\"LoS11\">[[Don Rosa]]: \"The Richest Duck in the World\" (chapter 11 of ''[[The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck]]''). First published 1994 ([http://coa.inducks.org/story.php?c=D+93288 I.N.D.U.C.K.S. entry])</ref>\n\nIn the story ''The Old Castle's Other Secret or A Letter from Home'' (2004), Don Rosa used Matilda McDuck in a non-''Life and Times'' story for the first time. In this story, it is shown that she was hired by her nephew [[Donald Duck]] (son of Hortense) to tend the McDuck castle in Scotland. The story shows the reconciliation between Matilda and Scrooge. It is suggested that Donald deliberately set them up for a reunion. Unfortunately, he did not get the thanks he expected. This is the first time [[Huey, Dewey, and Louie]] met their great aunt. In that story, Scrooge returns to [[Clan McDuck#The seat of Clan McDuck|McDuck Castle]] for another treasure and learns from Matilda that his family already knew about the treasure but their father Fergus decided not to tell Scrooge about it. Both Scrooge and Matilda thought that was because of Fergus' disapproval of Scrooge's greedy ways but after finding a letter on the way for the treasure (hence the other title \"A Letter from Home\") they learn Fergus's real motive was that he thought Scrooge would feel better building his own fortune instead of simply inheriting one.\n\nMatilda, while trying to leave the castle, mentions Hortense. However, in the commentary in the American printing of the story, Don Rosa states that he was prevented from using Hortense because he would have had to explain why she had abandoned her family. So Hortense's fate remains a mystery. In the notes to the Danish publication of the story (Hall of Fame - Don Rosa Book 10), it is stated that the publisher decided that Hortense was \"officially dead\".\n\nMatilda is usually drawn with a flower on her hat, which loses a petal in each panel in which she appears.\n\nDon Rosa has suggested that Matilda McDuck could have married the well-known Disney character [[Ludwig Von Drake]].<ref>[[Don Rosa]]: \"How the Duck Family Tree was grown\" (1995). Article in ''[[Walt Disney's Comics and Stories|Walt Disney's Comics]]'' #600 There has been some debate as to whether there was such a marriage, and about whether it ended in Von Drake's death, or in divorce.</ref>\n\nA picture of Matilda appears in the [[DuckTales (2017 TV series)|2017 DuckTales series]] pilot episode, \"Woo-oo!\", as part of Webby's research on Scrooge's family.\n\n=== Hortense McDuck ===\n'''Hortense Duck''' (n\u00e9e ''McDuck''; b. 1876) was introduced as a relatively well-connected member of her family. A daughter-in-law to [[Duck family (Disney)#Grandma Duck|Grandma Duck]], a sister to Matilda McDuck and [[Scrooge McDuck]], wife to [[Duck family (Disney)#Quackmore Duck|Quackmore Duck]], sister-in-law of [[Duck family (Disney)#Goosetave Gander|Goosetave Gander]] and [[Duck family (Disney)#Daphne Duck|Daphne Duck]], aunt to [[Duck family (Disney)#Gladstone Gander|Gladstone Gander]], mother to [[Della Duck]] and [[Donald Duck]], and finally grandmother to [[Huey, Dewey, and Louie]].\n\nHortense was born in 1876 in [[Glasgow]], Scotland as the youngest child of Fergus McDuck and Downy O'Drake. In Barks' tree, her oldest brother was [[Scrooge McDuck]] and her older sister Matilda McDuck. Some non-Barks writers gave Scrooge two half-brothers, Rumpus McFowl and Gideon McDuck, though these do not appear in Barks' conception of the family. De' Paperoni is a twin of Scrooge in a story. Jake McDuck, her paternal uncle, was also living with them.\n\nHortense was born in a [[working class]] family living in relative poverty. In 1877 her ten-year-old brother Scrooge started working as a shoe polisher in an effort to help support his family. At the time Hortense was merely an infant sucking on her thumb. She observed from a distance with her father and sister while her brother earned the [[Donald Duck universe#Number one dime|number one dime]]. Scrooge would spend some of his leisure time with his younger sisters, and occasionally repaired their [[doll]]s. Otherwise Hortense spent most of her time clinging to her older sister.\n\nBy 1880, Scrooge came to realise that his earnings were not enough despite his hard work and efforts. He emigrated to the United States in hopes of earning his own fortune. He was hired as a [[cabin boy]] on a merchant ship heading to [[New Orleans]]. Scrooge noted that Hortense's \"Bye, Scroogey\" were her first spoken words. Before that, all she could say was \"glxblt\".\n\nFrom an early age it was obvious Hortense had a fairly nasty temper combined with considerable strength, and on at least one occasion (in The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck, Chapter 10) she has been called a spitfire. In 1882, Scrooge was hired as a [[cowboy]] by [[Murdo MacKenzie]]. To do this he had to ride Widow Maker, a mare who had already managed to dispose of five other cowboys. Scrooge soon managed to become her rider although he never really managed to tame her. He renamed the horse [[List of Donald Duck universe characters#Hortense (horse)|Hortense]] after his spirited six-year-old sister. The latter found this idea unflattering at best.\n\nIn 1885, the Clan McDuck's hereditary lands were in danger of being seized due to her father being unable to pay taxes. The lands also included Dismal Downs, the Clan's castle which had been abandoned since 1675. The Whiskervilles, traditional enemies of the McDucks since the 15th century, planned to gain ownership of the lands and were already trying to plunder the castle and its graveyard in search of old relics and treasure. Fergus and Jake guarded the Castle in order to stop them. Nine-year-old Hortense offered to help them and proved more effective in conflict than either of the elder McDucks. The Whiskervilles came to fear her.\n\nIn 1902 Scrooge McDuck returned to Scotland to fetch Hortense and their sister Matilda McDuck. When Scrooge established [[Donald Duck universe#Duckburg|Duckburg]], [[Donald Duck universe#Calisota|Calisota]] as his home base he started journeying the world trying to expand his financial empire. One of her proudest moments was when she single-handedly caused the entire [[United States Armed Forces|US military]] to flee Killmotor Hill armed only with a broom and her bad temper, much to the shame of the current president, [[Theodore Roosevelt]], and the fear of the soldiers. From 1902 until 1930, she and Matilda ran Scrooge's empire from his home base while he was away. During these years Hortense met her boyfriend, Quackmore Duck, whom she married in 1920. Later the same year she gave birth to twins. Her son was named Donald Duck and her daughter Della Duck. Of the two only the boy inherited his mother's temper. A fight with Scrooge in 1930 ended all relationships between Scrooge and his family and she retired.\n\nScrooge may have claimed that he is the last McDuck, as he is the only male left. Hortense and Matilda changed their names to Duck after marriage, so, technically, Scrooge is the last McDuck.\n\nHortense is mentioned and pictured in the ''[[DuckTales]]'' 2017 premier \"Woo-oo!\", where [[Webby Vanderquack]] cites her as a connecting link between the triplets and Scrooge.\n\n=== Douglas McDuck ===\n'''Douglas McDuck''' is a cousin of Scrooge who has appeared in several Danish Disney comic stories. He looks like Scrooge not only in appearance but also in temperament. He is so incredibly stingy that he considers Scrooge a spendthrift, often criticizing a frustrated Scrooge for not being \"McDuck-like\" enough. Douglas is, however, hopeless at finding and identifying gold; he generally lives a rustic life in mining country, locating only fool's gold and earning a modest living. In the story \"[http://coa.inducks.org/story.php?c=D+2002-107 Smarter Than The Toughies]\", Douglas was portrayed as being the uncle of Whitewater Duck.\n\n=== Moocher McDuck ===\n'''Moocher McDuck''' is the beggar cousin of Scrooge who appeared for the first time in the story \"[http://coa.inducks.org/story.php?c=S+70121 Too Many McDucks]\" by [[Tony Strobl]]. Moocher's look is very similar to Scrooge's, except for the fact that he wears tattered clothes, but unlike his very rich cousin, Moocher is a sweetheart. He was used in some Brazilian comic stories in the 1970s.\n\n==Other relatives==\n===Duck family===\n{{main|Duck family (Disney)}}\nThe '''Duck family''' are Scrooge's American relatives and include his nephew [[Donald Duck|Donald]], niece [[Della Duck|Della]] and grandnephews [[Huey, Dewey, and Louie]]. They are related through Hortense's marriage to Quackmore Duck, Donald's father.\n\n===Aunt Eider===\n'''Aunt Eider''' is the aunt of both Scrooge McDuck and [[John D. Rockerduck]]. The Italian story \"La Stella di Burbank\",<ref>[http://coa.inducks.org/story.php?c=S+AT++215-C Coa Inducks - Page to the comic story ''The star of Burbank'' (title translated from Italian reprint)]</ref> where she is portrayed as a myopic old woman who doesn't realize she needs to wear glasses, is presumably her first comic book appearance. But Aunt Eider appears wearing glasses in her next three comic book appearances. [[Dick Kinney]] wrote the last three comic stories where this character was used, and three famous cartoonists respectively drew those ones. Al Hubbard, [[Marco Rota]] and [[Giorgio Cavazzano]]. Neither of these stories was published in America. The story \"Most Helpful Aunt Eider\" is the only one where Aunt Eider doesn't meet her wealthy nephews. It's a [[Junior Woodchucks]] story.<ref>[http://coa.inducks.org/story.php?c=S+73228 Coa Inducks - Page to the comic story ''Most Helpful Aunt Eider'']</ref>\n\nSince there isn't any clue on how the tireless and slightly bossy Aunt Eider could be the aunt of both Scrooge and Rockerduck in the comic stories with her, some fans of this universe have invented their own explanations for this fact. It really seems she never had a surname, so she has been connected to Scrooge's family through his paternal grandmother, Molly Mallard, who would be an aunt of Eider. This wouldmake Eider a ''Mallard'' too, but, of course, this is not a widely accepted explanation at all.

Within the [[Donald Duck universe]], the clan is related to the American [[Duck family (Disney)|Duck family]] through the marriage of Hortense McDuck and Quackmore Duck, [[Donald Duck|Donald]]'s parents.\n\nClan McDuck was created by American comic book author [[Carl Barks]], who also created the character of Scrooge McDuck. Barks' 1948 story \"[[The Old Castle's Secret]],\" in which Scrooge and his nephews search for hidden treasure in McDuck Castle, introduced the backstory of the clan. Other authors built on Barks' work, most notably [[Don Rosa]] in his 12-part comic saga ''[[The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck]]'' (1992\u201394) which introduced Scrooge's immediate family.\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Literary origins ==\n{{Image frame|width=307|content=[[Image:Carl barks.jpg|150px]][[File:Don Rosa in Helsinki 2008.JPG|157px]]|caption=[[Carl Barks]] (left) and [[Don Rosa]] (right)|link=|align=right}}\n\nIn the early 1950s, Carl Barks was in his second decade of creating comic book stories starring Donald Duck and his various relatives. He had personally created several of the latter, including cousin [[Duck family (Disney)#Gladstone Gander|Gladstone Gander]] and uncle Scrooge McDuck, although the specific relationships between them were still uncertain. To better define these relationships, Barks created a version of the McDuck/Duck/Coot [[family tree]] for his own personal benefit, incidentally creating several additional characters.\n\nDuring his retirement, Barks' stories remained popular and gained him unexpected fame. Barks gave several interviews during which he answered questions about his stories and the characters he had created. In 1981, Barks described his personal version of Donald's family tree, which was used by amateur artist Mark Worden in drawing the family tree and including portraits of the characters mentioned. Worden's tree was first published in several [[fanzine]]s, and later in the Disney-licensed ''[[Carl Barks Library]]'', a ten-volume hardcover collection of Barks' stories in black-and-white.\n\nIn 1987, Don Rosa, a long-time fan of Carl Barks and a personal friend of Mark Worden, started creating his own stories featuring Scrooge McDuck. His stories contained numerous references to older stories by Barks as well as several original ideas. After several years he gained a fan base of his own. In the early 1990s, the [[Egmont Group]], the publishing house employing Rosa, offered him an ambitious assignment: he was to create the definitive version of Scrooge's biography and a family tree to accompany it. The project was intended to end decades of contradictions between stories which caused confusion to readers. The project was to become ''[[The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck]]''. The family tree accompanying it was first published in [[Norway]] on July 3, 1993.\n\nIn the process of working on Scrooge's biography, Rosa studied Barks' old stories in detail. Rosa made note of as many clues as he could of Scrooge's past given by Barks \u2013 which Rosa dubbed \"Barksian facts\" \u2013 and used them to write new stories. Despite the ambitious nature of the project, Rosa himself stressed in the introduction to the book \"...this version of Scrooge's life is not the 'official' version \u2013 there's no particular reason why I (or anyone else) should expect other Duck writers to adhere to my vision of Scrooge's history. As carefully and authentically as I sought to construct it, it was never intended to be anything but my personal telling of the life of Scrooge McDuck.\"<ref>{{cite book | last = Rosa | first = Don | authorlink = Don Rosa | title = [[The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck]]: Volume One | year = 2009 | publisher = [[Boom!

In 1885, Quackly again tries to save Scrooge, but his action unintentionally brings about Scrooge's temporary death. In heaven, Quackly is reprimanded by his relatives for interfering in earthly events.<ref name=\"Rosa\"/><ref name=\"LoS1\"/> Quackly McDuck is first mentioned in ''The Old Castle's Secret'' (1948) by Carl Barks, and first appears in ''[[The Last of the Clan McDuck]]'' (1994) by Don Rosa.\n\n=== Murdoch McDuck ===\n'''Sir Murdoch McDuck''' (?-1066; from earlier Murdoch MacDuich) was a businessman who patented the longbow. Most notably in 1066, when the Normans invaded England, he had the latter sign a contract with him so they would have enough longbows to fight off the invaders. However, they didn't have enough arrows as Sir Murdoch charged extra for them. He is also the last of the Dark Ages McDucks and the one who modernized their family name \"MacDuich\" to the more familiar \"McDuck\". He only appears in the unfinished sketch-only story \"The History of the Clan McDuck\" (written and drawn approx. in 1992 by Don Rosa, but not released until December 2011), which was meant to serve as a prologue to \"The Last of the Clan McDuck\" before it was scrapped.\n\nIn the [[DuckTales (2017 TV series)|2017 ''DuckTales'' series]] episode, \"The Secret(s) of Castle McDuck!\", Downy McDuck relates Murdoch's history (which remains intact) to Huey, Dewey, Louie, and Webby. His longbow is later used as a clue that the boys use to uncover the mystery behind their mother, Della's, disappearance.\n\n=== Stuft McDuck ===\n'''Sir Stuft McDuck''' (1110-1175) was a successful chief of Clan McDuck who oversaw a period of prosperity.<ref name=\"Rosa\"/>\n\n=== Roast McDuck ===\n'''Sir Roast McDuck''' (1159-1205) succeeded his father, Stuft McDuck, as clan chief, at which point Clan McDuck was one of the richest clans in Scotland. However, in 1189, Roast offered much of the clan's wealth to the king of Scotland, [[William the Lion]], after William asked for his help in paying tribute to [[Richard I of England]]. This act of patriotic generosity led to financial ruin for the clan. Aside from this imprudence, Roast is primarily remembered for his gluttony. In 1205 he raided the king's pantry and ate himself to death.

In 1220, Swamphole sealed the dungeon of Castle McDuck, stated as an attempt to decrease maintenance costs. He did, however, create secret passageways in the castle leading to the dungeons. (These passageways would later be useful during subsequent sieges.) After his death in 1260, Swamphole was not buried in the clan cemetery, rather, his skeleton was placed inside his memorial suit of armor which was placed in Castle McDuck. Swamphole McDuck is first mentioned in ''The Old Castle's Secret'' by Carl Barks.<ref name=\"castle\"/> In ''[[The Old Castle's Other Secret or A Letter from Home]]'' (2004) by Don Rosa, it is revealed that Swamphole sealed the dungeons not to reduce maintenance costs, but to conceal a treasure.\n\nIn the [[DuckTales (2017 TV series)|2017 ''DuckTales'' series]] episode, \"The Secret(s) of Castle McDuck!\", he is stated to be a treasure hunter (like Scrooge) who constructed secret passageways underneath Castle McDuck and let loose a demon dog to protect his treasure. His ghost later appears to ward off said demon dog alongside the ghosts of several of his family members.\n\n=== Donald McDuck ===\n'''Sir Donald McDuck''', nicknamed \"'''[[Black Donald]]'''\" because of his foul temper, is said to have invented [[golf]], the [[hammer throw]], and the [[caber toss]] in 1440. His temper while playing golf resulted in [[James II of Scotland]] outlawing the sport. Black Donald is mentioned in \"The History of the Clan McDuck\" by Don Rosa.\n\nIn the [[DuckTales (2017 TV series)|2017 ''DuckTales'' series]] episode \"The Missing Links of Moorshire!\", Scrooge McDuck relates the story of how \"Black Donald\" McDuck invented golf and subsequently got it banned due to his temper to Dewey, Louie, and Webby before participating in a golf tournament in Scotland.\n\n=== Simon McDuck ===\n'''Sir Simon McDuck''' (1437-1509) was the treasurer of the [[Knights Templar]] and hid their treasure beneath McDuck Castle. He is mentioned in ''The Old Castle's Other Secret or A Letter from Home'' (2004) by Don Rosa.\n\nIn the [[DuckTales (2017 TV series)|2017 ''DuckTales'' series]] episode, \"The Secret(s) of Castle McDuck\", Scrooge McDuck states Simon was the \"accountant\" to the Knights Templar who had stolen and hidden their treasure somewhere underneath Castle McDuck, and he had returned to his father Fergus to reluctantly ask for his help in finding it since he knows where it is. His ghost appears later in the episode to stop a ghost hound from attacking Scrooge's grandnephews, Huey, Dewey, and Louie.\n\n== Early modern McDucks ==\n=== Malcolm McDuck ===\n'''Malcolm \"Matey\" McDuck''' (1530-1564?) was a McDuck relative who settled in [[England]] and is suggested to be a previous incarnation of Scrooge McDuck. Malcolm served in the [[Royal Navy|English Navy]], and in 1563 he became first mate of the frigate HMS ''Falcon Rover'', serving under Captain Loyal Hawk. The ''Falcon Rover'' raided Spanish targets in the [[Caribbean Sea]] between 1563 and 1564. Also serving on the ''Falcon Rover'' was the boatswain, [[Duck family (Disney)#Pintail Duck|Pintail Duck]], an ancestor of Donald Duck.\n\nMalcolm is said to have lost his life on 9 December 1564 when the Spanish fleet sunk the HMS ''Falcon Rover''.

Sometime after 1707, he became an associate of Scottish outlaw [[Rob Roy MacGregor]] who is characterized as a [[Gentleman thief|noble thief]] who would \"rob from the rich to give to the poor\". Locksley's alliance with MacGregor would come to an end after Locksley was unable to \"give to the poor\" after having robbed the rich. He is mentioned in ''The History of The Clan McDuck'' by Don Rosa. His name is derived from the English village of [[Loxley, South Yorkshire|Loxley]], the traditional birthplace of [[Robin Hood]].\n\n=== Hugh McDuck ===\n'''Captain Hugh \"Seafoam\" McDuck''' (1710-1776) was a McDuck relative who settled in [[Glasgow]] in 1727, as the clan had been driven from their ancestral home of Dismal Downs in 1675. Hugh turned to the sea for a living and became a successful merchant. He obtained his own ship, the ''Golden Goose'', and became known by the nickname \"Seafoam\".\n\nIn 1753, Seafoam McDuck signed a contract with [[List of Donald Duck universe characters#Chisel McSue|Swindle McSue]] to deliver a cargo of [[horseradish]] to [[Jamaica]]. But McSue sabotaged the ''Golden Goose'' and the ship sank before reaching Jamaica. Upon returning to Scotland, Seafoam McDuck learned that his contract with McSue contained fine print stating that if the shipment was not completed, McDuck would forfeit all his possessions to McSue. Seafoam escaped with nothing but the clothes on his back, a silver pocket watch, and the golden dentures in his mouth.<ref name=\"horseradish\">[[Carl Barks]]: Untitled Uncle Scrooge story, later known as \"The Horseradish Story\".

In fact, knowing he would seek out Simon McDuck's treasure, he left his son a note telling him to work hard and not accept hand-outs inside a hidden chamber underneath Castle McDuck.\n\n=== Molly Mallard ===\n'''Molly Mallard''' was the wife of Dingus McDuck and the mother of Angus, Fergus, and Jake McDuck. Her first and only appearance was in an illustrated family tree created by Don Rosa; she has not appeared in any stories. Coincidentally, her maiden name is the same as the title character of ''[[Darkwing Duck]].''<br>\n\nHer ghost makes a cameo appearance in the [[DuckTales (2017 TV series)|2017 ''DuckTales'' series]]' episode, \"The Secret(s) of Castle McDuck!\"\n\n=== Quagmire McDuck ===\n'''Quagmire McDuck''' was Dingus McDuck's brother and Scrooge McDuck's great uncle.

Around the time of the [[American Civil War]] (1861\u20131865) he became quite successful as a river boater. Soon after the end of the war in 1865 he and fellow river boater [[List of Donald Duck universe characters#Porker Hogg|Porker Hogg]] became the co-owners of Cornpone Gables, a [[plantations in the American South|Southern plantation]] that had gone bankrupt. The two were unable to settle their differences and they decided to have a riverboat race in 1870 to decide who would be the owner. Both riverboats sank. Porker had two more riverboats but Angus spent the next ten years as a professional card player.\n\nIn 1880, in a poker game with Porker, Angus won the rights to one of his rival's riverboats, named ''Dilly Dollar''. Porker soon lost his other riverboat to Blackheart Beagle and his sons, the first generation of the [[Beagle Boys]], a family of outlaws, and retired. Angus on the other hand hired his nephew [[Scrooge McDuck]] and a penniless inventor named [[Gyro Gearloose#Ratchet Gearloose|Ratchet Gearloose]] as his crew. Business wasn't going well and Angus decided to retire in 1882. He left his riverboat to his nephew and settled down in [[New Orleans]].<ref name=\"LoS2\"/>\n\nHe became the writer of a series of [[dime novel]]s under the title ''The Master of Mississippi'', based on a highly exaggerated description of his life.

Scrooge won, only to learn that 85 years of disuse made the mansion so fragile that he accidentally destroyed it with a sneeze.\n\nA character obviously based on Angus, but called \"Catfish\" McDuck and voiced by [[Peter Renaday]], appears in the 1987 ''[[DuckTales]]'' episode, \"Once Upon a Dime.\"\n\n=== Fergus McDuck ===\n'''Fergus McDuck''' (1835\u20131902<ref name=\"LoS9\">[[Don Rosa]]: \"The Billionaire of Dismal Downs\" (part 9 of ''[[The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck]]'').

In 1877 he encouraged his son to work to have his own money. Scrooge's obvious intelligence, skill at hard work and ambition made his father believe that Scrooge would be able to restore Clan McDuck to its former glory.<ref name=\"LoS1\"/> In the story ''Of Ducks, Dimes, and Destinies'', it is revealed that Scrooge's Number One Dime came from Fergus, who gave it to the man who used it to pay Scrooge for shining his shoes.\n\nIn 1885 the Clan's hereditary lands would have been seized due to Fergus' inability to pay his taxes.

Scrooge's intention was originally to settle in Dismal Downs but he quickly changed his mind and decided to settle in the United States. He wanted to take his family with him.

He died during the night, aged 72, and was re-united with his wife Downy and the rest of the McDuck Clan as his three children left Scotland.<ref name=\"LoS9\"/>\n\nIn [[Don Rosa]]'s ''The Old Castle's Other Secret or A Letter from Home'', it's revealed that Fergus tried to find the [[Knights Templar]] treasure hidden in the castle McDuck by one of his ancestors, a Knight himself. Even though Fergus decided not to tell Scrooge about the treasure, he learns about it through other ways and, like [[Clan McDuck#Matilda McDuck|Matilda McDuck]], thinks Fergus kept the secret from him because he disapproved of Scrooge. In the middle of their way to the treasure, Scrooge, Matilda and Scrooge's nephews find a letter from Fergus, who believed Scrooge would eventually find it, revealing the reason he hid the secret from Scrooge is that Scrooge would feel better building his own fortune instead of inheriting one.<ref>[[Don Rosa]]: \"A Letter From Home\".

Here he is referred to as \"McPapa.\" Fergus' name and image are also present in the 2017 ''[[DuckTales (2017 TV series)|DuckTales]]'' series, which draws heavily from the comics. He later appears (voiced by [[Graham McTavish]]) in the episode, \"The Secret(s) of Castle McDuck!\", having survived to the present day due to Scrooge rebuilding Castle McDuck using magic stones that granted his parents (and possibly Scrooge himself) immortality. Scrooge and Fergus' relationship is initially tense, with the latter expressing apparent disapproval of the former; though in reality, he was upset because Scrooge hadn't been a part of his life. They later reconcile after Fergus reveals he was the one who gave Scrooge his Number One Dime, via Burt the Ditch Digger, in order to give him the gift of \"self-reliance\" since he couldn't afford to buy him a proper gift.\n\nIn the 1993 [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] game ''[[DuckTales 2]]'', Scrooge and his nephews found a piece of a treasure map that led to the lost treasure of a character named Fergus McDuck. However, this Fergus is not Scrooge's father but Scrooge's great-great-uncle.\n\n=== Downy O'Drake ===\n'''Downy McDuck''' (n\u00e9e '''O'Drake'''; 1840\u20131897) is Scrooge McDuck's mother.

Gideon also has an antagonistic relationship with his brother Scrooge.\n\nThe character was created by [[Romano Scarpa]], and first appeared in the story \"Paperino e i gamberi in salm\u00ec\" (1956).<ref name=\"Gideon\"/> The character's debut story is the only one that was printed in the United States, as it was published in 2015 under the title \"Shellfish Motives\".\n\nGideon's existence is inconsistent with a statement made in [[Carl Barks]]'s \"The Old Castle's Secret\".<ref name=\"castle\"/> In this story, Scrooge states that he is the last of [[the Clan McDuck]], which would mean that he couldn't have a living sibling. However, Gideon is not the only living relative of Scrooge to carry the surname \"McDuck\", and therefore cause the same inconsistency with Barks's story; others include his sister Matilda and first cousin Douglas. In the American translation of \"Shellfish Motives\" Gideon is said to be younger than Scrooge, while the original version doesn't specify which one of them is younger.\n\n=== Matilda McDuck ===\n'''Matilda McDuck''' (born 1871) is one of Scrooge McDuck's two sisters.

In this story, it is shown that she was hired by her nephew [[Donald Duck]] (son of Hortense) to tend the McDuck castle in Scotland. The story shows the reconciliation between Matilda and Scrooge. It is suggested that Donald deliberately set them up for a reunion. Unfortunately, he did not get the thanks he expected. This is the first time [[Huey, Dewey, and Louie]] met their great aunt. In that story, Scrooge returns to [[Clan McDuck#The seat of Clan McDuck|McDuck Castle]] for another treasure and learns from Matilda that his family already knew about the treasure but their father Fergus decided not to tell Scrooge about it. Both Scrooge and Matilda thought that was because of Fergus' disapproval of Scrooge's greedy ways but after finding a letter on the way for the treasure (hence the other title \"A Letter from Home\") they learn Fergus's real motive was that he thought Scrooge would feel better building his own fortune instead of simply inheriting one.\n\nMatilda, while trying to leave the castle, mentions Hortense. However, in the commentary in the American printing of the story, Don Rosa states that he was prevented from using Hortense because he would have had to explain why she had abandoned her family. So Hortense's fate remains a mystery. In the notes to the Danish publication of the story (Hall of Fame - Don Rosa Book 10), it is stated that the publisher decided that Hortense was \"officially dead\".\n\nMatilda is usually drawn with a flower on her hat, which loses a petal in each panel in which she appears.\n\nDon Rosa has suggested that Matilda McDuck could have married the well-known Disney character [[Ludwig Von Drake]].<ref>[[Don Rosa]]: \"How the Duck Family Tree was grown\" (1995).

A daughter-in-law to [[Duck family (Disney)#Grandma Duck|Grandma Duck]], a sister to Matilda McDuck and [[Scrooge McDuck]], wife to [[Duck family (Disney)#Quackmore Duck|Quackmore Duck]], sister-in-law of [[Duck family (Disney)#Goosetave Gander|Goosetave Gander]] and [[Duck family (Disney)#Daphne Duck|Daphne Duck]], aunt to [[Duck family (Disney)#Gladstone Gander|Gladstone Gander]], mother to [[Della Duck]] and [[Donald Duck]], and finally grandmother to [[Huey, Dewey, and Louie]].\n\nHortense was born in 1876 in [[Glasgow]], Scotland as the youngest child of Fergus McDuck and Downy O'Drake. In Barks' tree, her oldest brother was [[Scrooge McDuck]] and her older sister Matilda McDuck. Some non-Barks writers gave Scrooge two half-brothers, Rumpus McFowl and Gideon McDuck, though these do not appear in Barks' conception of the family. De' Paperoni is a twin of Scrooge in a story. Jake McDuck, her paternal uncle, was also living with them.\n\nHortense was born in a [[working class]] family living in relative poverty. In 1877 her ten-year-old brother Scrooge started working as a shoe polisher in an effort to help support his family. At the time Hortense was merely an infant sucking on her thumb. She observed from a distance with her father and sister while her brother earned the [[Donald Duck universe#Number one dime|number one dime]]. Scrooge would spend some of his leisure time with his younger sisters, and occasionally repaired their [[doll]]s. Otherwise Hortense spent most of her time clinging to her older sister.\n\nBy 1880, Scrooge came to realise that his earnings were not enough despite his hard work and efforts. He emigrated to the United States in hopes of earning his own fortune. He was hired as a [[cabin boy]] on a merchant ship heading to [[New Orleans]]. Scrooge noted that Hortense's \"Bye, Scroogey\" were her first spoken words. Before that, all she could say was \"glxblt\".\n\nFrom an early age it was obvious Hortense had a fairly nasty temper combined with considerable strength, and on at least one occasion (in The Life and Times of Scrooge McDuck, Chapter 10) she has been called a spitfire. In 1882, Scrooge was hired as a [[cowboy]] by [[Murdo MacKenzie]]. To do this he had to ride Widow Maker, a mare who had already managed to dispose of five other cowboys. Scrooge soon managed to become her rider although he never really managed to tame her. He renamed the horse [[List of Donald Duck universe characters#Hortense (horse)|Hortense]] after his spirited six-year-old sister. The latter found this idea unflattering at best.\n\nIn 1885, the Clan McDuck's hereditary lands were in danger of being seized due to her father being unable to pay taxes. The lands also included Dismal Downs, the Clan's castle which had been abandoned since 1675. The Whiskervilles, traditional enemies of the McDucks since the 15th century, planned to gain ownership of the lands and were already trying to plunder the castle and its graveyard in search of old relics and treasure. Fergus and Jake guarded the Castle in order to stop them. Nine-year-old Hortense offered to help them and proved more effective in conflict than either of the elder McDucks. The Whiskervilles came to fear her.\n\nIn 1902 Scrooge McDuck returned to Scotland to fetch Hortense and their sister Matilda McDuck. When Scrooge established [[Donald Duck universe#Duckburg|Duckburg]], [[Donald Duck universe#Calisota|Calisota]] as his home base he started journeying the world trying to expand his financial empire. One of her proudest moments was when she single-handedly caused the entire [[United States Armed Forces|US military]] to flee Killmotor Hill armed only with a broom and her bad temper, much to the shame of the current president, [[Theodore Roosevelt]], and the fear of the soldiers. From 1902 until 1930, she and Matilda ran Scrooge's empire from his home base while he was away. During these years Hortense met her boyfriend, Quackmore Duck, whom she married in 1920. Later the same year she gave birth to twins. Her son was named Donald Duck and her daughter Della Duck. Of the two only the boy inherited his mother's temper. A fight with Scrooge in 1930 ended all relationships between Scrooge and his family and she retired.\n\nScrooge may have claimed that he is the last McDuck, as he is the only male left. Hortense and Matilda changed their names to Duck after marriage, so, technically, Scrooge is the last McDuck.\n\nHortense is mentioned and pictured in the ''[[DuckTales]]'' 2017 premier \"Woo-oo!\", where [[Webby Vanderquack]] cites her as a connecting link between the triplets and Scrooge.\n\n=== Douglas McDuck ===\n'''Douglas McDuck''' is a cousin of Scrooge who has appeared in several Danish Disney comic stories. He looks like Scrooge not only in appearance but also in temperament. He is so incredibly stingy that he considers Scrooge a spendthrift, often criticizing a frustrated Scrooge for not being \"McDuck-like\" enough. Douglas is, however, hopeless at finding and identifying gold; he generally lives a rustic life in mining country, locating only fool's gold and earning a modest living. In the story \"[http://coa.inducks.org/story.php?c=D+2002-107 Smarter Than The Toughies]\", Douglas was portrayed as being the uncle of Whitewater Duck.\n\n=== Moocher McDuck ===\n'''Moocher McDuck''' is the beggar cousin of Scrooge who appeared for the first time in the story \"[http://coa.inducks.org/story.php?c=S+70121 Too Many McDucks]\" by [[Tony Strobl]]. Moocher's look is very similar to Scrooge's, except for the fact that he wears tattered clothes, but unlike his very rich cousin, Moocher is a sweetheart. He was used in some Brazilian comic stories in the 1970s.\n\n==Other relatives==\n===Duck family===\n{{main|Duck family (Disney)}}\nThe '''Duck family''' are Scrooge's American relatives and include his nephew [[Donald Duck|Donald]], niece [[Della Duck|Della]] and grandnephews [[Huey, Dewey, and Louie]]. They are related through Hortense's marriage to Quackmore Duck, Donald's father.\n\n===Aunt Eider===\n'''Aunt Eider''' is the aunt of both Scrooge McDuck and [[John D. Rockerduck]]. The Italian story \"La Stella di Burbank\",<ref>[http://coa.inducks.org/story.php?c=S+AT++215-C Coa Inducks - Page to the comic story ''The star of Burbank'' (title translated from Italian reprint)]</ref> where she is portrayed as a myopic old woman who doesn't realize she needs to wear glasses, is presumably her first comic book appearance. But Aunt Eider appears wearing glasses in her next three comic book appearances. [[Dick Kinney]] wrote the last three comic stories where this character was used, and three famous cartoonists respectively drew those ones. Al Hubbard, [[Marco Rota]] and [[Giorgio Cavazzano]]. Neither of these stories was published in America. The story \"Most Helpful Aunt Eider\" is the only one where Aunt Eider doesn't meet her wealthy nephews. It's a [[Junior Woodchucks]] story.<ref>[http://coa.inducks.org/story.php?c=S+73228 Coa Inducks - Page to the comic story ''Most Helpful Aunt Eider'']</ref>\n\nSince there isn't any clue on how the tireless and slightly bossy Aunt Eider could be the aunt of both Scrooge and Rockerduck in the comic stories with her, some fans of this universe have invented their own explanations for this fact. It really seems she never had a surname, so she has been connected to Scrooge's family through his paternal grandmother, Molly Mallard, who would be an aunt of Eider. This wouldmake Eider a ''Mallard'' too, but, of course, this is not a widely accepted explanation at all. According to this same invented explanation, Aunt Eider would be a sister of Rockerduck's mother.\n\nThe first version of Scrooge's grandmother, '''Nonna Jenny''', looks like Aunt Eider.<ref>[http://coa.inducks.org/creator.php?c=GBC&showScans=1 Coa Inducks - Page for Giovan Battista Carpi's Gallery]</ref> She was created by the Italian comic artists Guido Martina and Giovan Battista Carpi especially for the handbook ''I pensieri di Paperone'', first published in 1973.<ref>[http://www.furrymania.it/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=242:guido-martina-i-pensieri-di-paperone&catid=33&Itemid=158 'I Pensieri Di Paperone' di Guido Martina]</ref>\n\n===Ludwig Von Drake===\n{{main|Ludwig Von Drake}}\n'''Ludwig Von Drake''' is Donald Duck's uncle whose relationship has never been consistently described. Don Rosa fans have speculated that Ludwig is married to Matilda McDuck, but the Disney company has portrayed him as a bachelor.\n\n== In other languages ==\n*{{lang-ar|\u0639\u0634\u064a\u0631\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u0637}}, \"The Duck Clan\"\n*{{lang-bg|\u041c\u0430\u043a\u0434\u044a\u043a \u0441\u0435\u043c\u0435\u0439\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e\u0442\u043e}}, \"Family Makdak\"\n*{{lang-da|von And-Klanen}}\n*{{lang-nl|McDuck clan}}\n*{{lang-fi|MacAnkan Klaani}}\n*{{lang-fr|Le clan McPicsou}}\n*{{lang-de|Der Duck-Clan}}\n*{{lang-el|\u0393\u03b5\u03bd\u03b9\u03ac \u03c4\u03c9\u03bd \u039c\u03b1\u03ba \u039d\u03c4\u03b1\u03ba}}, \"The line of the Mac Ducks\"\n*{{Lang-is|\u00c6ttin A\u00f0al\u00f6nd}}, \"Family Aethal\u00f6nd\".
