A GWAS study will look at one disease, and then sequence the genome of many patients with that particular  disease to look for shared mutations in the genome. Mutations that are determined to be related to a disease by a GWAS study can then be used to diagnose that disease in future patients, by looking at their genome sequence to find that same mutation. The first GWAS, conducted in 2005, studied patients with [[age-related macular degeneration]] (ARMD).<ref name=four>{{cite journal|last=Haines|first=J.L.|title=Complement Factor H Variant Increases the Risk of Age-Related Macular Degeneration|journal=Science|date=April 15, 2005|volume=308|issue=5720|pages=419\u201321|doi=10.1126/science.1110359|pmid=15761120|bibcode=2005Sci...308..419H|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/930000cd89036622bddf8a62bb3b84deb58e97b5}}<!--|accessdate=April 26, 2014--></ref> It found two different mutations, each containing only a variation in only one nucleotide (called [[single nucleotide polymorphism]]s, or SNPs), which were associated with ARMD.

This approach uses the same sequencing technology to focus on the evaluation of disease risk, allowing the physician to initiate preventive treatment before the disease presents itself in their patient. For example, if it is found that a DNA mutation increases a person's risk of developing [[Type 2 Diabetes]], this individual can begin lifestyle changes that will lessen their chances of developing Type 2 Diabetes later in life.\n\n== Applications ==\n\nAdvances in personalised medicine will create a more unified treatment approach specific to the individual and their genome.

The Patent Office is currently reviewing a number of issues related to patent laws for personalised medicine, such as whether \u201cconfirmatory\u201d secondary genetic tests post initial diagnosis, can have full immunity from patent laws. Those who oppose patents argue that patents on DNA sequences are an impediment to ongoing research while proponents point to [[research exemption]] and stress that patents are necessary to entice and protect the financial investments required for commercial research and the development and advancement of services offered.<ref name=eighteen />\n\n===Reimbursement policies===\nReimbursement policies will have to be redefined to fit the changes that personalised medicine will bring to the healthcare system. Some of the factors that should be considered are the level of efficacy of various genetic tests in the general population, cost-effectiveness relative to benefits, how to deal with payment systems for extremely rare conditions, and how to redefine the insurance concept of \u201cshared risk\u201d to incorporate the effect of the newer concept of \u201cindividual risk factors\".<ref name=sixteen /> The study, ''Barriers to the Use of Personalized Medicine in Breast Cancer'', took two different diagnostic tests which are BRACAnalysis and Oncotype DX. These tests have over ten-day turnaround times which results in the tests failing and delays in treatments. Patients are not being reimbursed for these delays which results in tests not being ordered. Ultimately, this leads to patients having to pay out-of-pocket for treatments because insurance companies do not want to accept the risks involved.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Weldon|first=Christine B.|last2=Trosman|first2=Julia R.|last3=Gradishar|first3=William J.|last4=Benson|first4=Al B.|last5=Schink|first5=Julian C.|date=July 2012|title=Barriers to the Use of Personalized Medicine in Breast Cancer|journal=Journal of Oncology Practice|language=en|volume=8|issue=4|pages=e24\u2013e31|doi=10.1200/jop.2011.000448|issn=1554-7477|pmc=3396824|pmid=23180995}}</ref>\n\n===Patient privacy and confidentiality===\nPerhaps the most critical issue with the commercialization of personalised medicine is the protection of patients. One of the largest issues is the fear and potential consequences for patients who are predisposed after genetic testing or found to be non-responsive towards certain treatments. This includes the psychological effects on patients due to genetic testing results. The right of family members who do not directly consent is another issue, considering that genetic predispositions and risks are inheritable. The implications for certain ethnic groups and presence of a common allele would also have to be considered.<ref name=sixteen />  In 2008, the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) was passed in an effort to minimize the fear of patients participating in genetic research by ensuring that their genetic information will not be misused by employers or insurers.<ref name=sixteen /> On February 19, 2015 FDA issued a press release titled: \"FDA permits marketing of first direct-to-consumer genetic carrier test for Bloom syndrome.<ref name=\"one2\"/>\n\n==See also==\n{{col div|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Chemogenomics]]\n* [[Drug discovery]]\n* [[Elective genetic and genomic testing]]\n* [[Foundation Medicine]]\n* [[Next-generation sequencing]]\n* [[Personal genomics]]\n* [[Pharmacodiagnostic testing]]\n* [[Pharmacogenetics]]\n* [[Pharmacogenomics]]\n* [[Phenotypic screening]]\n{{colend}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{emerging technologies|topics=yes|biomed=yes}}\n{{Medicine}}\n{{Portal bar|Medicine}}\n\n[[Category:Biomarkers]]\n[[Category:Biotechnology]]\n[[Category:Chemical pathology]]\n[[Category:Medical signs]]\n[[Category:Medical models]]\n[[Category:Emerging technologies]]\n", "text_old": "{{Genetics sidebar}}\n'''Personalized medicine''', [[precision medicine]], or '''theranostics''' is a [[medical model]] that separates people into different groups\u2014with medical decisions, practices, interventions and/or products being tailored to the individual patient based on their predicted response or risk of disease.<ref name=\"AcMedSci\">{{cite techreport| title=Stratified, personalised or P4 medicine: a new direction for placing the patient at the centre of healthcare and health education |publisher=Academy of Medical Sciences |date=May 2015 |accessdate= 6 January 2016 |url=http://www.acmedsci.ac.uk/download.php?f=file&i=32644 }}</ref> The terms personalized medicine, precision medicine, '''stratified medicine''' and P4 medicine are used interchangeably to describe this concept<ref name=\"AcMedSci\" /><ref name=\"PHGdef\">{{cite web |title=Many names for one concept or many concepts in one name? |publisher=PHG Foundation |accessdate= 6 January 2015 |url=http://www.phgfoundation.org/file/13380}}</ref> though some authors and organisations use these expressions separately to indicate particular nuances.<ref name=\"PHGdef\" />\n\nWhile the tailoring of treatment to patients dates back at least to the time of [[Hippocrates]],<ref>{{cite journal |last=Egnew |first=Thomas |date=1 March 2009 |title=Suffering, Meaning, and Healing: Challenges of Contemporary Medicine |journal=Annals of Family Medicine |volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=170\u2013175 |doi=10.1370/afm.943 |pmid=19273873 |pmc=2653974 }}</ref> the term has risen in usage in recent years given the growth of new diagnostic and informatics approaches that provide understanding of the molecular basis of disease, particularly [[genomics]].

A GWAS study will look at one disease, and then sequence the genome of many patients with that particular  disease to look for shared mutations in the genome. Mutations that are determined to be related to a disease by a GWAS study can then be used to diagnose that disease in future patients, by looking at their genome sequence to find that same mutation. The first GWAS, conducted in 2005, studied patients with [[age-related macular degeneration]] (ARMD).<ref name=four>{{cite journal|last=Haines|first=J.L.|title=Complement Factor H Variant Increases the Risk of Age-Related Macular Degeneration|journal=Science|date=April 15, 2005|volume=308|issue=5720|pages=419\u201321|doi=10.1126/science.1110359|pmid=15761120|bibcode=2005Sci...308..419H|url=https://semanticscholar.org/paper/930000cd89036622bddf8a62bb3b84deb58e97b5}}<!--|accessdate=April 26, 2014--></ref> It found two different mutations, each containing only a variation in only one nucleotide (called [[single nucleotide polymorphism]]s, or SNPs), which were associated with ARMD.

This approach uses the same sequencing technology to focus on the evaluation of disease risk, allowing the physician to initiate preventive treatment before the disease presents itself in their patient. For example, if it is found that a DNA mutation increases a person's risk of developing [[Type 2 Diabetes]], this individual can begin lifestyle changes that will lessen their chances of developing Type 2 Diabetes later in life.\n\n== Applications ==\n\nAdvances in personalised medicine will create a more unified treatment approach specific to the individual and their genome.

An FDA report in October 2013 entitled, \u201c''Paving the Way for Personalized Medicine: FDA\u2019s role in a New Era of Medical Product Development'',\u201d in which they outlined steps they would have to take to integrate genetic and biomarker information for clinical use and drug development.<ref name=seventeen>{{cite web|title=Paving the Way for Personalized Medicine: FDA's Role in a New Era of Medical Product Development|url=https://www.fda.gov/downloads/scienceresearch/specialtopics/personalizedmedicine/ucm372421.pdf|publisher=U.S Food and Drug Administration|accessdate=April 26, 2014}}</ref>  They determined that they would have to develop specific regulatory science standards, research methods, reference material and other tools in order to incorporate personalised medicine into their current regulatory practices. For example, they are working on a \u201cgenomic reference library\u201d for regulatory agencies to compare and test the validity of different sequencing platforms in an effort to uphold reliability.<ref name=seventeen />\n\n===Intellectual property rights===\nAs with any innovation in medicine, investment and interest in personalised medicine is influenced by intellectual property rights.<ref name=sixteen />  There has been a lot of controversy regarding patent protection for diagnostic tools, genes, and biomarkers.<ref name=eighteen>{{cite web|title=Intellectual Property Issues Impacting the Future of Personalized Medicine|url=http://www.aipla.org/committees/committee_pages/Biotechnology/diagnostics/SharedDocuments/Personalized.Med.IP.docx|publisher=American Intellectual Property Law Association|accessdate=April 26, 2014}}{{dead link|date=November 2016}}</ref>  In June 2013, the U.S Supreme Court ruled that natural occurring genes cannot be patented, while \u201csynthetic DNA\u201d that is edited or artificially- created can still be patented. The Patent Office is currently reviewing a number of issues related to patent laws for personalised medicine, such as whether \u201cconfirmatory\u201d secondary genetic tests post initial diagnosis, can have full immunity from patent laws. Those who oppose patents argue that patents on DNA sequences are an impediment to ongoing research while proponents point to [[research exemption]] and stress that patents are necessary to entice and protect the financial investments required for commercial research and the development and advancement of services offered.<ref name=eighteen />\n\n===Reimbursement policies===\nReimbursement policies will have to be redefined to fit the changes that personalised medicine will bring to the healthcare system. Some of the factors that should be considered are the level of efficacy of various genetic tests in the general population, cost-effectiveness relative to benefits, how to deal with payment systems for extremely rare conditions, and how to redefine the insurance concept of \u201cshared risk\u201d to incorporate the effect of the newer concept of \u201cindividual risk factors\".<ref name=sixteen /> The study, ''Barriers to the Use of Personalized Medicine in Breast Cancer'', took two different diagnostic tests which are BRACAnalysis and Oncotype DX. These tests have over ten-day turnaround times which results in the tests failing and delays in treatments. Patients are not being reimbursed for these delays which results in tests not being ordered. Ultimately, this leads to patients having to pay out-of-pocket for treatments because insurance companies do not want to accept the risks involved.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Weldon|first=Christine B.|last2=Trosman|first2=Julia R.|last3=Gradishar|first3=William J.|last4=Benson|first4=Al B.|last5=Schink|first5=Julian C.|date=July 2012|title=Barriers to the Use of Personalized Medicine in Breast Cancer|journal=Journal of Oncology Practice|language=en|volume=8|issue=4|pages=e24\u2013e31|doi=10.1200/jop.2011.000448|issn=1554-7477|pmc=3396824|pmid=23180995}}</ref>\n\n===Patient privacy and confidentiality===\nPerhaps the most critical issue with the commercialization of personalised medicine is the protection of patients. One of the largest issues is the fear and potential consequences for patients who are predisposed after genetic testing or found to be non-responsive towards certain treatments. This includes the psychological effects on patients due to genetic testing results. The right of family members who do not directly consent is another issue, considering that genetic predispositions and risks are inheritable. The implications for certain ethnic groups and presence of a common allele would also have to be considered.<ref name=sixteen />  In 2008, the Genetic Information Nondiscrimination Act (GINA) was passed in an effort to minimize the fear of patients participating in genetic research by ensuring that their genetic information will not be misused by employers or insurers.<ref name=sixteen /> On February 19, 2015 FDA issued a press release titled: \"FDA permits marketing of first direct-to-consumer genetic carrier test for Bloom syndrome.<ref name=\"one2\"/>\n\n==See also==\n{{col div|colwidth=30em}}\n* [[Chemogenomics]]\n* [[Drug discovery]]\n* [[Elective genetic and genomic testing]]\n* [[Foundation Medicine]]\n* [[Next-generation sequencing]]\n* [[Personal genomics]]\n* [[Pharmacodiagnostic testing]]\n* [[Pharmacogenetics]]\n* [[Pharmacogenomics]]\n* [[Phenotypic screening]]\n{{colend}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n{{emerging technologies|topics=yes|biomed=yes}}\n{{Medicine}}\n{{Portal bar|Medicine}}\n\n[[Category:Biomarkers]]\n[[Category:Biotechnology]]\n[[Category:Chemical pathology]]\n[[Category:Medical signs]]\n[[Category:Medical models]]\n[[Category:Emerging technologies]]\n", "name_user": "Rjwilmsi", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eRespiratory proteomics:Journal cites:,", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personalized_medicine"}
