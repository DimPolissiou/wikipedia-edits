If {{nowrap|1=(''n'' \u2212 1)!}} were congruent to {{nowrap|1=\u22121 (mod ''n'')}} then it would also be congruent to \u22121 (mod ''q''). But (''n''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1)!&nbsp;\u2261&nbsp;0&nbsp;(mod&nbsp;''q'').\n\nIn fact, more is true. With the sole exception of 4, where 3!&nbsp;=&nbsp;6&nbsp;\u2261&nbsp;2&nbsp;(mod&nbsp;4), if ''n'' is composite then (''n''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1)! is congruent to 0 (mod&nbsp;''n''). The proof is divided into two cases: First, if ''n'' can be factored as the product of two unequal numbers, {{nowrap|1=''n'' = ''ab''}}, where 2&nbsp;\u2264&nbsp;''a'' < ''b''&nbsp;\u2264&nbsp;''n''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;2, then both ''a'' and ''b'' will appear in the product {{nowrap|1=1 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 ... \u00d7 (''n'' \u2212 1) = (''n'' \u2212 1)!}} and (''n''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1)! will be divisible by ''n''. If ''n'' has no such factorization, then it must be the square of some prime ''q'', ''q''&nbsp;>&nbsp;2. But then 2''q''&nbsp;<&nbsp;''q''<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;''n'', both ''q'' and 2''q'' will be factors of (''n''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1)!, and again ''n'' divides (''n''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1)!.\n\n===Prime modulus===\n\n; Elementary proof\n\nThe result is trivial when {{nowrap|1=''p'' = 2}}, so assume ''p'' is an odd prime, {{nowrap|1=''p'' \u2265 3}}. Since the residue classes (mod ''p'') are a field, every non-zero ''a'' has a unique multiplicative inverse, ''a''<sup>\u22121</sup>. [[Lagrange's theorem (number theory)|Lagrange's theorem]] implies that the only values of ''a'' for which {{nowrap|1=''a'' \u2261 ''a''<sup>\u22121</sup> (mod ''p'')}} are {{nowrap|1=''a'' \u2261 \u00b11 (mod ''p'')}} (because the congruence {{nowrap|1=''a''<sup>2</sup> \u2261 1}} can have at most two roots (mod ''p'')). Therefore, with the exception of \u00b11, the factors of {{nowrap|1=(''p'' \u2212 1)!}} can be arranged in unequal pairs,<ref>When ''n'' = 3, the only factors are \u00b11</ref> where the product of each pair is {{nowrap|1=\u2261 1 (mod ''p'')}}. This proves Wilson's theorem.\n\nFor example, if {{nowrap|1=''p'' = 11}},\n\n:<math>10! = [(1\\cdot10)]\\cdot[(2\\cdot6)(3\\cdot4)(5\\cdot9)(7\\cdot8)]  \\equiv [-1]\\cdot[1\\cdot1\\cdot1\\cdot1]  \\equiv -1 \\pmod{11}.</math>\n\n; Proof using Fermat's little theorem\n\nAgain, the result is trivial for ''p''&nbsp;=&nbsp;2, so suppose ''p'' is an odd prime, {{nowrap|1=''p'' \u2265  3}}. Consider the polynomial\n\n:<math>g(x)=(x-1)(x-2) \\cdots (x-(p-1)).</math>\n\n''g'' has degree {{nowrap|1=''p'' \u2212 1}}, leading term {{nowrap|1=''x''<sup>''p'' \u2212 1</sup>}}, and constant term {{nowrap|1=(''p'' \u2212 1)!}}. Its {{nowrap|1=''p'' \u2212 1}} roots are 1, 2, ..., {{nowrap|1=''p'' \u2212 1}}.\n\nNow consider\n\n:<math>h(x)=x^{p-1}-1.</math>\n\n''h'' also has degree {{nowrap|1=''p'' \u2212 1}} and leading term {{nowrap|1=''x''<sup>''p'' \u2212 1</sup>}}. Modulo ''p'',  [[Fermat's little theorem]] says it also has the same {{nowrap|1=''p'' \u2212 1}} roots, 1, 2, ..., {{nowrap|1=''p'' \u2212 1}}.\n\nFinally, consider\n:<math>f(x)=g(x)-h(x).</math>\n\n''f'' has degree at most ''p''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;2 (since the leading terms cancel), and modulo ''p'' also has the {{nowrap|1=''p'' \u2212 1}} roots 1, 2, ..., {{nowrap|1=''p'' \u2212 1}}. But Lagrange's theorem says it cannot have more than ''p''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;2 roots. Therefore, ''f'' must be identically zero (mod ''p''), so its constant term is {{nowrap|1=(''p'' \u2212 1)! + 1 \u2261 0 (mod ''p'')}}. This is Wilson's theorem.\n\n; Proof using the Sylow theorems\n\nIt is possible to deduce Wilson's theorem from a particular application of the [[Sylow theorems]]. Let ''p'' be a prime.

If {{nowrap|1=(''n'' \u2212 1)!}} were congruent to {{nowrap|1=\u22121 (mod ''n'')}} then it would also be congruent to \u22121 (mod ''q''). But (''n''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1)!&nbsp;\u2261&nbsp;0&nbsp;(mod&nbsp;''q'').\n\nIn fact, more is true. With the sole exception of 4, where 3!&nbsp;=&nbsp;6&nbsp;\u2261&nbsp;2&nbsp;(mod&nbsp;4), if ''n'' is composite then (''n''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1)! is congruent to 0 (mod&nbsp;''n''). The proof is divided into two cases: First, if ''n'' can be factored as the product of two unequal numbers, {{nowrap|1=''n'' = ''ab''}}, where 2&nbsp;\u2264&nbsp;''a'' < ''b''&nbsp;\u2264&nbsp;''n''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;2, then both ''a'' and ''b'' will appear in the product {{nowrap|1=1 \u00d7 2 \u00d7 ... \u00d7 (''n'' \u2212 1) = (''n'' \u2212 1)!}} and (''n''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1)! will be divisible by ''n''. If ''n'' has no such factorization, then it must be the square of some prime ''q'', ''q''&nbsp;>&nbsp;2. But then 2''q''&nbsp;<&nbsp;''q''<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;=&nbsp;''n'', both ''q'' and 2''q'' will be factors of (''n''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1)!, and again ''n'' divides (''n''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1)!.\n\n===Prime modulus===\n\n; Elementary proof\n\nThe result is trivial when {{nowrap|1=''p'' = 2}}, so assume ''p'' is an odd prime, {{nowrap|1=''p'' \u2265 3}}. Since the residue classes (mod ''p'') are a field, every non-zero ''a'' has a unique multiplicative inverse, ''a''<sup>\u22121</sup>. [[Lagrange's theorem (number theory)|Lagrange's theorem]] implies that the only values of ''a'' for which {{nowrap|1=''a'' \u2261 ''a''<sup>\u22121</sup> (mod ''p'')}} are {{nowrap|1=''a'' \u2261 \u00b11 (mod ''p'')}} (because the congruence {{nowrap|1=''a''<sup>2</sup> \u2261 1}} can have at most two roots (mod ''p'')). Therefore, with the exception of \u00b11, the factors of {{nowrap|1=(''p'' \u2212 1)!}} can be arranged in unequal pairs,<ref>When ''n'' = 3, the only factors are \u00b11</ref> where the product of each pair is {{nowrap|1=\u2261 1 (mod ''p'')}}. This proves Wilson's theorem.\n\nFor example, if {{nowrap|1=''p'' = 11}},\n\n:<math>10! = [(1\\cdot10)]\\cdot[(2\\cdot6)(3\\cdot4)(5\\cdot9)(7\\cdot8)]  \\equiv [-1]\\cdot[1\\cdot1\\cdot1\\cdot1]  \\equiv -1 \\pmod{11}.</math>\n\n; Proof using Fermat's little theorem\n\nAgain, the result is trivial for ''p''&nbsp;=&nbsp;2, so suppose ''p'' is an odd prime, {{nowrap|1=''p'' \u2265  3}}. Consider the polynomial\n\n:<math>g(x)=(x-1)(x-2) \\cdots (x-(p-1)).</math>\n\n''g'' has degree {{nowrap|1=''p'' \u2212 1}}, leading term {{nowrap|1=''x''<sup>''p'' \u2212 1</sup>}}, and constant term {{nowrap|1=(''p'' \u2212 1)!}}. Its {{nowrap|1=''p'' \u2212 1}} roots are 1, 2, ..., {{nowrap|1=''p'' \u2212 1}}.\n\nNow consider\n\n:<math>h(x)=x^{p-1}-1.</math>\n\n''h'' also has degree {{nowrap|1=''p'' \u2212 1}} and leading term {{nowrap|1=''x''<sup>''p'' \u2212 1</sup>}}. Modulo ''p'',  [[Fermat's little theorem]] says it also has the same {{nowrap|1=''p'' \u2212 1}} roots, 1, 2, ..., {{nowrap|1=''p'' \u2212 1}}.\n\nFinally, consider\n:<math>f(x)=g(x)-h(x).</math>\n\n''f'' has degree at most ''p''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;2 (since the leading terms cancel), and modulo ''p'' also has the {{nowrap|1=''p'' \u2212 1}} roots 1, 2, ..., {{nowrap|1=''p'' \u2212 1}}. But Lagrange's theorem says it cannot have more than ''p''&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;2 roots. Therefore, ''f'' must be identically zero (mod ''p''), so its constant term {{nowrap|1=(''p'' \u2212 1)! + 1 \u2261 0 (mod ''p'')}}. This is Wilson's theorem.\n\n; Proof using the Sylow theorems\n\nIt is possible to deduce Wilson's theorem from a particular application of the [[Sylow theorems]]. Let ''p'' be a prime. It is immediate to deduce that the [[symmetric group]] <math> S_p </math> has exactly <math>(p-1)!</math> elements of order ''p'', namely the ''p''-cycles <math> C_p </math>. On the other hand, each Sylow ''p''-subgroup in <math> S_p </math> is a copy of <math> C_p </math>. Hence it follows that the number of Sylow ''p''-subgroups is <math> n_p=(p-2)! </math>. The third Sylow theorem implies\n:<math>(p-2)! \\equiv 1 \\pmod p.</math>\nMultiplying both sides by {{nowrap|1=(''p'' \u2212 1)}} gives\n:<math>(p-1)! \\equiv p-1 \\equiv -1 \\pmod p,</math>\nthat is, the result.\n\n==Applications==\n\n===Primality tests===\nIn practice, Wilson's theorem is useless as a [[primality test]] because computing (''n'' \u2212 1)! modulo ''n'' for large ''n'' is [[Computational complexity theory|computationally complex]], and much faster primality tests are known (indeed, even [[trial division]] is considerably more efficient).\n\n===Quadratic residues===\nUsing Wilson's Theorem, for any odd prime {{nowrap|1=''p'' = 2''m'' + 1}}, we can rearrange the left hand side of\n\n:<math>1\\cdot 2\\cdots (p-1)\\ \\equiv\\ -1\\ \\pmod{p}</math>\n\nto obtain the equality\n\n:<math>1\\cdot(p-1)\\cdot 2\\cdot (p-2)\\cdots m\\cdot (p-m)\\ \\equiv\\ 1\\cdot (-1)\\cdot 2\\cdot (-2)\\cdots m\\cdot (-m)\\ \\equiv\\  -1 \\pmod{p}.</math>\n\nThis becomes\n\n:<math>\\prod_{j=1}^m\\ j^2\\ \\equiv(-1)^{m+1} \\pmod{p}</math>\n\nor\n\n:<math>(m!)^2 \\equiv(-1)^{m+1} \\pmod{p}.</math>\n\nWe can use this fact to prove part of a famous result: for any prime ''p'' such that [[Pythagorean prime|''p''&nbsp;\u2261&nbsp;1&nbsp;(mod&nbsp;4)]], the number (\u22121) is a square ([[quadratic residue]]) mod ''p''.

The properties of ceramics make fracturing an important inspection method.]]\n\nA ceramic material is an inorganic, non-metallic, often crystalline oxide, nitride or carbide material. Some elements, such as [[carbon]] or [[silicon]], may be considered ceramics. Ceramic materials are brittle, hard, strong in compression, and weak in [[shear stress|shearing]] and tension. They withstand chemical erosion that occurs in other materials subjected to acidic or caustic environments. Ceramics generally can withstand very high temperatures, ranging from 1,000&nbsp;\u00b0C to 1,600&nbsp;\u00b0C (1,800&nbsp;\u00b0F to 3,000&nbsp;\u00b0F). [[Glass]] is often not considered a ceramic because of its [[amorphous]] (noncrystalline) character. However, glassmaking involves several steps of the ceramic process, and its mechanical properties are similar to ceramic materials.\n\nTraditional ceramic raw materials include clay minerals such as [[kaolinite]], whereas more recent materials include aluminium oxide, more commonly known as [[alumina]]. The modern ceramic materials, which are classified as advanced ceramics, include [[silicon carbide]] and [[tungsten carbide]]. Both are valued for their abrasion resistance and hence find use in applications such as the wear plates of crushing equipment in mining operations. Advanced ceramics are also used in the medicine, electrical, electronics industries and body armor.\n\n===Crystalline ceramics===\nCrystalline ceramic materials are not amenable to a great range of processing. Methods for dealing with them tend to fall into one of two categories \u2013 either make the ceramic in the desired shape, by reaction ''in situ'', or by \"forming\" powders into the desired shape, and then [[sintering]] to form a solid body. [[Ceramic forming techniques]] include shaping by hand (sometimes including a rotation process called \"throwing\"), [[Slipcasting|slip casting]], [[tape casting]] (used for making very thin ceramic capacitors), [[injection molding]], dry pressing, and other variations. \n\n===Noncrystalline ceramics===\nNoncrystalline ceramics, being glass, tend to be formed from melts. The glass is shaped when either fully molten, by casting, or when in a state of toffee-like viscosity, by methods such as blowing into a mold. If later heat treatments cause this glass to become partly crystalline, the resulting material is known as a glass-ceramic, widely used as cook-tops and also as a glass composite material for nuclear waste disposal.\n\n==History==\nHuman beings appear to have been making their own ceramics for at least 26,000 years, subjecting clay and silica to intense heat to fuse and form ceramic materials. The earliest found so far were in southern central Europe, and were sculpted figures, not dishes.<ref>[https://depts.washington.edu/matseed/mse_resources/Webpage/Ceramics/ceramichistory.htm Ceramic History - Washington University]</ref> \n\nThe earliest known pottery was made by mixing animal products with clay, and baked in kilns at up to 800\u00b0 centigrade. While actual pottery fragments have been found up to 19,000 years old, it wasn't until about ten thousand years later that regular pottery became common. \n\nAn early people that spread across much of Europe is named after its use of pottery, the [[Corded Ware culture]]. These early [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] peoples decorated their pottery by wrapping it with rope while still wet. When the ceramics were fired, the rope burned off but left a decorative pattern of complex grooves in the surface.\n[[File:Museum_f\u00fcr_Vor-_und_Fr\u00fchgeschichte_Berlin_031.jpg | right|thumb|Corded-Ware culture pottery from 2,500 BC.]]\n\nThe invention of the [[wheel]] eventually led to the production of smoother, more even pottery using the wheel-forming technique, like the [[pottery wheel]]. \n\nEarly ceramics were porous, absorbing water easily. It became useful for more items with the discovery of [[Ceramic glaze|glazing]] techniques, coating pottery with silicon, bone ash, or other materials that could melt and reform into a glassy surface, making a vessel less pervious to water.\n\n===Archaeology===\nCeramic artifacts have an important role in archaeology for understanding the culture, technology and behavior of peoples of the past. They are among the most common artifacts to be found at an archaeological site, generally in the form of small fragments of broken pottery called [[sherd]]s. Processing of collected sherds can be consistent with two main types of analysis: technical and traditional.\n\nTraditional analysis involves sorting ceramic artifacts, sherds and larger fragments into specific types based on style, composition, manufacturing and morphology. By creating these typologies it is possible to distinguish between different cultural styles, the purpose of the ceramic and technological state of the people among other conclusions. In addition, by looking at stylistic changes of ceramics over time is it possible to separate (seriate) the ceramics into distinct diagnostic groups (assemblages). A comparison of ceramic artifacts with known dated assemblages allows for a chronological assignment of these pieces.<ref>Mississippi Valley Archaeological Center, [http://www.uwlax.edu/mvac/processarch/processarch/lab_ceramic.html Ceramic Analysis] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120603053406/http://www.uwlax.edu/mvac/processarch/processarch/lab_ceramic.html |date=June 3, 2012 }}, Retrieved 04-11-12</ref>\n\nThe technical approach to ceramic analysis involves a finer examination of the composition of ceramic artifacts and sherds to determine the source of the material and through this the possible manufacturing site. Key criteria are the composition of the clay and the [[Temper (pottery)|temper]] used in the manufacture of the article under study: temper is a material added to the clay during the initial production stage, and it is used to aid the subsequent drying process. Types of temper include shell pieces, granite fragments and ground sherd pieces called 'grog'. Temper is usually identified by microscopic examination of the temper material. Clay identification is determined by a process of refiring the ceramic, and assigning a color to it using Munsell Soil Color notation. By estimating both the clay and temper compositions, and locating a region where both are known to occur, an assignment of the material source can be made. From the source assignment of the artifact further investigations can be made into the site of manufacture.\n\n\n==Properties==\nThe physical properties of any ceramic substance are a direct result of its crystalline structure and chemical composition. [[Solid-state chemistry]] reveals the fundamental connection between microstructure and properties such as localized density variations, grain size distribution, type of porosity and second-phase content, which can all be correlated with ceramic properties such as mechanical strength \u03c3 by the Hall-Petch equation, [[hardness]], [[toughness]], [[dielectric constant]], and the [[optical]] properties exhibited by [[transparent materials]].\n\n[[Ceramography]] is the art and science of preparation, examination and evaluation of ceramic microstructures. Evaluation and characterization of ceramic microstructures is often implemented on similar spatial scales to that used commonly in the emerging field of nanotechnology: from tens of [[angstrom]]s (A) to tens of micrometers (\u00b5m). This is typically somewhere between the minimum wavelength of visible light and the resolution limit of the naked eye.\n\nThe microstructure includes most grains, secondary phases, grain boundaries, pores, micro-cracks, structural defects and hardness microindentions. Most bulk mechanical, optical, thermal, electrical and magnetic properties are significantly affected by the observed microstructure. The fabrication method and process conditions are generally indicated by the microstructure. The root cause of many ceramic failures is evident in the cleaved and polished microstructure. Physical properties which constitute the field of [[materials science]] and [[engineering]] include the following:\n\n===Mechanical properties===\n\n[[File:Ultra-thin separated (Carborundum) disk.jpg|thumb|Cutting disks made of [[silicon carbide]]]]\nMechanical properties are important in structural and building materials as well as textile fabrics. In modern [[materials science]], fracture mechanics is an important tool in improving the mechanical performance of materials and components. It applies the [[physics]] of [[stress (mechanics)|stress]] and [[Deformation (mechanics)|strain]], in particular the theories of [[Elasticity (physics)|elasticity]] and [[Plasticity (physics)|plasticity]], to the microscopic [[crystallographic defects]] found in real materials in order to predict the macroscopic mechanical failure of bodies. [[Fractography]] is widely used with fracture mechanics to understand the causes of failures and also verify the theoretical [[failure]] predictions with real life failures.\n\nCeramic materials are usually [[ionic bond|ionic]] or [[covalent]] bonded materials, and can be [[crystal]]line or [[amorphous solid|amorphous]]. A material held together by either type of bond will tend to [[Fracture#Brittle fracture|fracture]] before any [[plastic deformation]] takes place, which results in poor [[toughness]] in these materials. Additionally, because these materials tend to be porous, the [[porosity|pore]]s and other microscopic imperfections act as [[Stress concentration|stress concentrators]], decreasing the toughness further, and reducing the [[tensile strength]]. These combine to give [[catastrophic failure]]s, as opposed to the more ductile [[failure mode]]s of metals.\n\nThese materials do show [[plasticity (physics)|plastic deformation]]. However, because of the rigid structure of the crystalline materials, there are very few available [[slip system]]s for [[dislocation]]s to move, and so they deform very slowly. With the non-crystalline (glassy) materials, [[Viscosity|viscous]] flow is the dominant source of plastic deformation, and is also very slow. It is therefore neglected in many applications of ceramic materials.\n\nTo overcome the brittle behaviour, ceramic material development has introduced the class of [[ceramic matrix composite]] materials, in which ceramic fibers are embedded and with specific coatings are forming fiber bridges across any crack. This mechanism substantially increases the fracture toughness of such ceramics. Ceramic [[Disc brake|disc brakes]] are an example of using a ceramic matrix composite material manufactured with a specific process.\n\n==== Ice-templating for enhanced mechanical properties ====\nIf a ceramic will be subjected to substantial mechanical loading it can undergo a process called [[Freeze-casting|ice-templating]], which allows some control of the [[microstructure]] of the ceramic product and therefore some control of the mechanical properties. Ceramic engineers use this technique to tune the mechanical properties to their desired application. Specifically, [[Strength of materials|strength]] is increased when this technique is employed. Ice templating allows the creation of macroscopic pores in a unidirectional arrangement. The applications of this oxide strengthening technique are important for [[Solid oxide fuel cell|solid oxide fuel cells]] and [[Water purification|water filtration]] devices.{{clarify|reason=why is it important in these specific applications? why is it specifically an oxide strengthening technique?|date=December 2019}}{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\nTo process a sample through ice templating, an aqueous [[Colloid|colloidal suspension]] is prepared containing the dissolved ceramic powder evenly dispersed throughout the colloid,{{clarify|reason=is the powder in suspension or actually dissolved?|date=December 2019}} for example [[Yttria-stabilized zirconia]] (YSZ). The solution is then cooled from the bottom to the top on a platform that allows for unidirectional cooling. This forces [[ice]] crystals to grow in compliance to the unidirectional cooling, and these ice crystals force the dissolved YSZ particles to the solidification front of the solid-liquid interphase boundary, resulting in pure ice crystals lined up unidirectionally alongside concentrated pockets of colloidal particles. The sample is then simultaneously heated and the pressure is reduced enough to force the ice crystals to [[Sublimation (phase transition)|sublimate]] and the YSZ pockets begin to [[Annealing (metallurgy)|anneal]] together to form macroscopically aligned ceramic microstructures. The sample is then further [[Sintering|sintered]] to complete the [[evaporation]] of the residual water and the final consolidation of the ceramic microstructure.{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\nDuring ice-templating a few variables can be controlled to influence the pore size and morphology of the microstructure. These important variables are the initial solids loading of the colloid, the cooling rate, the sintering temperature and duration, and the use of certain additives which can influence the micro-structural morphology during the process. A good understanding of these parameters is essential to understanding the relationships between processing, microstructure, and mechanical properties of anisotropically porous materials.<ref>Seuba, Jordi, Silvain Deville, Christian Guizard, and Adam J. Stevenson (14 April 2016).

Retrieved 9 October 2019.</ref>\n\n===Electrical properties===\n\n====Semiconductors====\nSome ceramics are [[semiconductor]]s. Most of these are [[transition metal oxides]] that are II-VI semiconductors, such as [[zinc oxide]].\n\nWhile there are prospects of mass-producing blue [[LED]]s from zinc oxide, ceramicists are most interested in the electrical properties that show [[grain boundary]] effects.\n\nOne of the most widely used of these is the varistor. These are devices that exhibit the property that resistance drops sharply at a certain [[threshold voltage]]. Once the voltage across the device reaches the threshold, there is a [[Electrical breakdown|breakdown]] of the electrical structure in the vicinity of the grain boundaries, which results in its [[electrical resistance]] dropping from several megohms down to a few hundred [[Ohm (unit)|ohm]]s. The major advantage of these is that they can dissipate a lot of energy, and they self-reset \u2013 after the voltage across the device drops below the threshold, its resistance returns to being high.\n\nThis makes them ideal for [[Surge protector|surge-protection]] applications; as there is control over the threshold voltage and energy tolerance, they find use in all sorts of applications. The best demonstration of their ability can be found in [[electrical substation]]s, where they are employed to protect the infrastructure from [[lightning]] strikes. They have rapid response, are low maintenance, and do not appreciably degrade from use, making them virtually ideal devices for this application.\n\nSemiconducting ceramics are also employed as [[gas sensor]]s. When various gases are passed over a polycrystalline ceramic, its electrical resistance changes. With tuning to the possible gas mixtures, very inexpensive devices can be produced.\n\n====Superconductivity====\n[[File:Magnet 4.jpg|thumb|The [[Meissner effect]] demonstrated by levitating a magnet above a cuprate superconductor, which is cooled by [[liquid nitrogen]]]]\nUnder some conditions, such as extremely low temperature, some ceramics exhibit [[high-temperature superconductivity]].{{clarify|reason=contradictory: why is it high-temperature superconductivity if extremely low temperatures are required? In superconductivity high temperature means above 30 K|date=December 2019}} The reason for this is not understood, but there are two major families of superconducting ceramics.\n\n====Ferroelectricity and supersets====\n[[Piezoelectricity]], a link between electrical and mechanical response, is exhibited by a large number of ceramic materials, including the quartz used to [[crystal oscillator|measure time]] in watches and other electronics. Such devices use both properties of piezoelectrics, using electricity to produce a mechanical motion (powering the device) and then using this mechanical motion to produce electricity (generating a signal). The unit of time measured is the natural interval required for electricity to be converted into mechanical energy and back again.\n\nThe piezoelectric effect is generally stronger in materials that also exhibit [[pyroelectricity]], and all pyroelectric materials are also piezoelectric. These materials can be used to inter-convert between thermal, mechanical, or electrical energy; for instance, after synthesis in a furnace, a pyroelectric crystal allowed to cool under no applied stress generally builds up a static charge of thousands of volts. Such materials are used in [[motion sensor]]s, where the tiny rise in temperature from a warm body entering the room is enough to produce a measurable voltage in the crystal.\n\nIn turn, pyroelectricity is seen most strongly in materials which also display the [[ferroelectric effect]], in which a stable electric dipole can be oriented or reversed by applying an electrostatic field.  Pyroelectricity is also a necessary consequence of ferroelectricity. This can be used to store information in [[ferroelectric capacitor]]s, elements of [[ferroelectric RAM]].\n\nThe most common such materials are [[lead zirconate titanate]] and [[barium titanate]]. Aside from the uses mentioned above, their strong piezoelectric response is exploited in the design of high-frequency [[loudspeaker]]s, transducers for [[sonar]], and actuators for [[atomic force microscope|atomic force]] and [[scanning tunneling microscope]]s.\n\n====Positive thermal coefficient====\n[[File:Si3N4thruster.jpg|thumb|left|Silicon nitride rocket thruster. Left: Mounted in test stand. Right: Being tested with H<sub>2</sub>/O<sub>2</sub> propellants]]\nIncreases in temperature can cause grain boundaries to suddenly become insulating in some semiconducting ceramic materials, mostly mixtures of [[heavy metals|heavy metal]] [[titanate]]s. The critical transition temperature can be adjusted over a wide range by variations in chemistry. In such materials, current will pass through the material until [[joule heating]] brings it to the transition temperature, at which point the circuit will be broken and current flow will cease. Such ceramics are used as self-controlled heating elements in, for example, the rear-window defrost circuits of automobiles.\n\nAt the transition temperature, the material's [[dielectric]] response becomes theoretically infinite. While a lack of temperature control would rule out any practical use of the material near its critical temperature, the dielectric effect remains exceptionally strong even at much higher temperatures. Titanates with critical temperatures far below room temperature have become synonymous with \"ceramic\" in the context of ceramic capacitors for just this reason.\n\n===Optical properties===\n[[File:cermax.jpg|thumb|150px|Cermax xenon arc lamp with synthetic sapphire output window]]\n[[Optics|Optically transparent materials]] focus on the response of a material to incoming lightwaves of a range of wavelengths. [[Optical filter|Frequency selective optical filters]] can be utilized to alter or enhance the brightness and contrast of a digital image. Guided lightwave transmission via frequency selective [[waveguides]] involves the emerging field of fiber [[optics]] and the ability of certain glassy compositions as a [[transmission medium]] for a range of frequencies simultaneously ([[multi-mode optical fiber]]) with little or no [[Adjacent-channel interference|interference]] between competing [[wavelengths]] or frequencies. This [[resonant]] [[Normal mode|mode]] of [[energy]] and [[data transmission]] via electromagnetic (light) [[wave propagation]], though low powered, is virtually lossless. Optical waveguides are used as components in [[Integrated optical circuit]]s (e.g. [[light-emitting diodes]], LEDs) or as the transmission medium in local and long haul [[optical communication]] systems. Also of value to the emerging materials scientist is the sensitivity of materials to radiation in the thermal [[infrared]] (IR) portion of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]]. This heat-seeking ability is responsible for such diverse optical phenomena as [[Night-vision]] and IR [[luminescence]].\n\nThus, there is an increasing need in the [[military]] sector for high-strength, robust materials which have the capability to [[transmit]] [[light]] ([[electromagnetic waves]]) in the [[visible spectrum|visible]] (0.4 \u2013 0.7 micrometers) and mid-[[infrared]] (1 \u2013 5 micrometers) regions of the spectrum. These materials are needed for applications requiring [[transparency and translucency|transparent]] armor, including next-generation high-speed [[missile]]s and pods, as well as protection against improvised explosive devices (IED).\n\nIn the 1960s, scientists at General Electric (GE) discovered that under the right manufacturing conditions, some ceramics, especially [[aluminium oxide]] (alumina), could be made [[translucent]]. These translucent materials were transparent enough to be used for containing the electrical [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] generated in high-[[pressure]] [[sodium]] street lamps. During the past two decades, additional types of transparent ceramics have been developed for applications such as nose cones for [[heat-seeking]] [[missiles]], [[window]]s for fighter [[aircraft]], and [[scintillation counter]]s for computed [[tomography]] scanners.\n\nIn the early 1970s, Thomas Soules pioneered computer modeling of light transmission through translucent ceramic alumina. His model showed that microscopic [[porosity|pores]] in ceramic, mainly trapped at the junctions of microcrystalline [[Crystallite|grains]], caused light to [[scattering|scatter]] and prevented true transparency. The volume fraction of these microscopic pores had to be less than 1% for high-quality optical transmission.\n\nThis is basically a [[particle size (grain size)|particle size]] effect. [[Opacity (optics)|Opacity]] results from the [[incoherent scattering]] of light at surfaces and [[Interface (chemistry)|interfaces]]. In addition to pores, most of the interfaces in a typical metal or ceramic object are in the form of [[grain boundaries]] which separate tiny regions of crystalline order. When the size of the scattering center (or grain boundary) is reduced below the size of the wavelength of the light being scattered, the scattering no longer occurs to any significant extent.\n\nIn the formation of [[polycrystalline]] materials ([[metals]] and ceramics) the size of the [[crystalline]] grains is determined largely by the size of the crystalline [[wiktionary:Particles|particles]] present in the raw material during formation (or pressing) of the object. Moreover, the size of the [[grain boundaries]] scales directly with particle size. Thus a reduction of the original particle size below the [[wavelength]] of [[visible light]] (~ 0.5 micrometers for shortwave violet) eliminates any light [[scattering]], resulting in a [[transparency and translucency|transparent]] material.\n\nRecently{{When|date=March 2011}}, Japanese scientists have developed techniques to produce ceramic parts that rival the [[Transparency and translucency|transparency]] of traditional crystals (grown from a single seed) and exceed the [[fracture toughness]] of a single crystal.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} In particular, scientists at the Japanese firm Konoshima Ltd., a producer of ceramic construction materials and industrial chemicals, have been looking for markets for their transparent ceramics.\n\nLivermore researchers realized that these ceramics might greatly benefit high-powered [[lasers]] used in the National Ignition Facility (NIF) Programs Directorate.

Such plates are known commonly as [[Small Arms Protective Insert|small arms protective insert]]s, or SAPIs. Similar material is used to protect the [[Cockpit (aviation)|cockpits]] of some military airplanes, because of the low weight of the material.\n*Ceramics can be used in place of steel for [[ball bearing]]s. Their higher hardness means they are much less susceptible to wear and typically last for triple the lifetime of a steel part. They also deform less under load, meaning they have less contact with the bearing retainer walls and can roll faster. In very high speed applications, heat from [[friction]] during rolling can cause problems for metal bearings, which are reduced by the use of ceramics. Ceramics are also more chemically resistant and can be used in wet environments where steel bearings would rust. In some cases, their electricity-insulating properties may also be valuable in bearings. Two drawbacks to ceramic bearings are a significantly higher cost and susceptibility to damage under shock loads.\n*In the early 1980s, [[Toyota]] researched production of an [[adiabatic]] [[internal combustion engine|engine]] using ceramic components in the hot gas area. The ceramics would have allowed temperatures of over 3000&nbsp;\u00b0F (1650&nbsp;\u00b0C). The expected advantages would have been lighter materials and a smaller cooling system (or no need for one at all), leading to a major weight reduction. The expected increase of [[fuel efficiency]] of the engine (caused by the higher temperature, as shown by [[Carnot heat engine|Carnot's]] theorem) could not be verified experimentally; it was found that the heat transfer on the hot ceramic cylinder walls was higher than the transfer to a cooler metal wall as the cooler gas film on the metal surface works as a [[thermal insulator]]. Thus, despite all of these desirable properties, such engines have not succeeded in production because of costs for the ceramic components and the limited advantages. (Small imperfections in the ceramic material with its low [[fracture toughness]] lead to cracks, which can lead to potentially dangerous equipment failure.) Such engines are possible in laboratory settings, but mass production is not feasible with current technology. {{Citation needed|date=July 2009|reason=Where are any other references to Toyota's work?}}\n*Work is being done in developing ceramic parts for [[gas turbine]] [[heat engine|engines]]. Currently, even blades made of [[superalloy|advanced metal alloys]] used in the engines' hot section require cooling and careful limiting of operating temperatures. Turbine engines made with ceramics could operate more efficiently, giving aircraft greater range and payload for a set amount of fuel.\n*Recent advances have been made in ceramics which include [[bioceramic]]s, such as dental implants and synthetic bones. [[Hydroxyapatite]], the natural mineral component of bone, has been made synthetically from a number of biological and chemical sources and can be formed into ceramic materials. Orthopedic implants coated with these materials bond readily to bone and other tissues in the body without rejection or inflammatory reactions so are of great interest for gene delivery and [[tissue engineering]] scaffolds. Most hydroxyapatite ceramics are very porous and lack mechanical strength, and are used to coat metal orthopedic devices to aid in forming a bond to bone or as bone fillers. They are also used as fillers for orthopedic plastic screws to aid in reducing the inflammation and increase absorption of these plastic materials. Work is being done to make strong, fully dense nanocrystalline hydroxyapatite ceramic materials for orthopedic weight bearing devices, replacing foreign metal and plastic orthopedic materials with a synthetic, but naturally occurring, bone mineral. Ultimately, these ceramic materials may be used as bone replacements or with the incorporation of protein [[collagen]]s, synthetic bones.\n*Durable actinide-containing ceramic materials have many applications such as in nuclear fuels for burning excess Pu and in chemically-inert sources of alpha irradiation for power supply of unmanned space vehicles or to produce electricity for microelectronic devices. Both use and disposal of radioactive actinides require their immobilisation in a durable host material. Nuclear waste long-lived radionuclides such as actinides are immobilised using chemically-durable crystalline materials based on polycrystalline ceramics and large single crystals.<ref>B.E.

The properties of ceramics make fracturing an important inspection method.]]\n\nA ceramic material is an inorganic, non-metallic, often crystalline oxide, nitride or carbide material. Some elements, such as [[carbon]] or [[silicon]], may be considered ceramics. Ceramic materials are brittle, hard, strong in compression, and weak in [[shear stress|shearing]] and tension. They withstand chemical erosion that occurs in other materials subjected to acidic or caustic environments. Ceramics generally can withstand very high temperatures, ranging from 1,000&nbsp;\u00b0C to 1,600&nbsp;\u00b0C (1,800&nbsp;\u00b0F to 3,000&nbsp;\u00b0F). [[Glass]] is often not considered a ceramic because of its [[amorphous]] (noncrystalline) character. However, glassmaking involves several steps of the ceramic process, and its mechanical properties are similar to ceramic materials.\n\nTraditional ceramic raw materials include clay minerals such as [[kaolinite]], whereas more recent materials include aluminium oxide, more commonly known as [[alumina]]. The modern ceramic materials, which are classified as advanced ceramics, include [[silicon carbide]] and [[tungsten carbide]]. Both are valued for their abrasion resistance and hence find use in applications such as the wear plates of crushing equipment in mining operations. Advanced ceramics are also used in the medicine, electrical, electronics industries and body armor.\n\n===Crystalline ceramics===\nCrystalline ceramic materials are not amenable to a great range of processing. Methods for dealing with them tend to fall into one of two categories \u2013 either make the ceramic in the desired shape, by reaction ''in situ'', or by \"forming\" powders into the desired shape, and then [[sintering]] to form a solid body. [[Ceramic forming techniques]] include shaping by hand (sometimes including a rotation process called \"throwing\"), [[Slipcasting|slip casting]], [[tape casting]] (used for making very thin ceramic capacitors), [[injection molding]], dry pressing, and other variations. \n\n===Noncrystalline ceramics===\nNoncrystalline ceramics, being glass, tend to be formed from melts. The glass is shaped when either fully molten, by casting, or when in a state of toffee-like viscosity, by methods such as blowing into a mold. If later heat treatments cause this glass to become partly crystalline, the resulting material is known as a glass-ceramic, widely used as cook-tops and also as a glass composite material for nuclear waste disposal.\n\n==History==\nHuman beings appear to have been making their own ceramics for at least 26,000 years, subjecting clay and silica to intense heat to fuse and form ceramic materials. The earliest found so far were in southern central Europe, and were sculpted figures, not dishes.<ref>[https://depts.washington.edu/matseed/mse_resources/Webpage/Ceramics/ceramichistory.htm Ceramic History - Washington University]</ref> \n\nThe earliest known pottery was made by mixing animal products with clay, and baked in kilns at up to 800\u00b0 centigrade. While actual pottery fragments have been found up to 19,000 years old, it wasn't until about ten thousand years later that regular pottery became common. \n\nAn early people that spread across much of Europe is named after its use of pottery, the [[Corded Ware culture]]. These early [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] peoples decorated their pottery by wrapping it with rope while still wet. When the ceramics were fired, the rope burned off but left a decorative pattern of complex grooves in the surface.\n[[File:Museum_f\u00fcr_Vor-_und_Fr\u00fchgeschichte_Berlin_031.jpg | right|thumb|Corded-Ware culture pottery from 2,500 BC.]]\n\nThe invention of the [[wheel]] eventually led to the production of smoother, more even pottery using the wheel-forming technique, like the [[pottery wheel]]. \n\nEarly ceramics were porous, absorbing water easily. It became useful for more items with the discovery of [[glazing]] techniques, coating pottery with silicon, bone ash, or other materials that could melt and reform into a glassy surface, making a vessel less pervious to water.\n\n===Archaeology===\nCeramic artifacts have an important role in archaeology for understanding the culture, technology and behavior of peoples of the past. They are among the most common artifacts to be found at an archaeological site, generally in the form of small fragments of broken pottery called [[sherd]]s. Processing of collected sherds can be consistent with two main types of analysis: technical and traditional.\n\nTraditional analysis involves sorting ceramic artifacts, sherds and larger fragments into specific types based on style, composition, manufacturing and morphology. By creating these typologies it is possible to distinguish between different cultural styles, the purpose of the ceramic and technological state of the people among other conclusions. In addition, by looking at stylistic changes of ceramics over time is it possible to separate (seriate) the ceramics into distinct diagnostic groups (assemblages). A comparison of ceramic artifacts with known dated assemblages allows for a chronological assignment of these pieces.<ref>Mississippi Valley Archaeological Center, [http://www.uwlax.edu/mvac/processarch/processarch/lab_ceramic.html Ceramic Analysis] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120603053406/http://www.uwlax.edu/mvac/processarch/processarch/lab_ceramic.html |date=June 3, 2012 }}, Retrieved 04-11-12</ref>\n\nThe technical approach to ceramic analysis involves a finer examination of the composition of ceramic artifacts and sherds to determine the source of the material and through this the possible manufacturing site. Key criteria are the composition of the clay and the [[Temper (pottery)|temper]] used in the manufacture of the article under study: temper is a material added to the clay during the initial production stage, and it is used to aid the subsequent drying process. Types of temper include shell pieces, granite fragments and ground sherd pieces called 'grog'. Temper is usually identified by microscopic examination of the temper material. Clay identification is determined by a process of refiring the ceramic, and assigning a color to it using Munsell Soil Color notation. By estimating both the clay and temper compositions, and locating a region where both are known to occur, an assignment of the material source can be made. From the source assignment of the artifact further investigations can be made into the site of manufacture.\n\n\n==Properties==\nThe physical properties of any ceramic substance are a direct result of its crystalline structure and chemical composition. [[Solid-state chemistry]] reveals the fundamental connection between microstructure and properties such as localized density variations, grain size distribution, type of porosity and second-phase content, which can all be correlated with ceramic properties such as mechanical strength \u03c3 by the Hall-Petch equation, [[hardness]], [[toughness]], [[dielectric constant]], and the [[optical]] properties exhibited by [[transparent materials]].\n\n[[Ceramography]] is the art and science of preparation, examination and evaluation of ceramic microstructures. Evaluation and characterization of ceramic microstructures is often implemented on similar spatial scales to that used commonly in the emerging field of nanotechnology: from tens of [[angstrom]]s (A) to tens of micrometers (\u00b5m). This is typically somewhere between the minimum wavelength of visible light and the resolution limit of the naked eye.\n\nThe microstructure includes most grains, secondary phases, grain boundaries, pores, micro-cracks, structural defects and hardness microindentions. Most bulk mechanical, optical, thermal, electrical and magnetic properties are significantly affected by the observed microstructure. The fabrication method and process conditions are generally indicated by the microstructure. The root cause of many ceramic failures is evident in the cleaved and polished microstructure. Physical properties which constitute the field of [[materials science]] and [[engineering]] include the following:\n\n===Mechanical properties===\n\n[[File:Ultra-thin separated (Carborundum) disk.jpg|thumb|Cutting disks made of [[silicon carbide]]]]\nMechanical properties are important in structural and building materials as well as textile fabrics. In modern [[materials science]], fracture mechanics is an important tool in improving the mechanical performance of materials and components. It applies the [[physics]] of [[stress (mechanics)|stress]] and [[Deformation (mechanics)|strain]], in particular the theories of [[Elasticity (physics)|elasticity]] and [[Plasticity (physics)|plasticity]], to the microscopic [[crystallographic defects]] found in real materials in order to predict the macroscopic mechanical failure of bodies. [[Fractography]] is widely used with fracture mechanics to understand the causes of failures and also verify the theoretical [[failure]] predictions with real life failures.\n\nCeramic materials are usually [[ionic bond|ionic]] or [[covalent]] bonded materials, and can be [[crystal]]line or [[amorphous solid|amorphous]]. A material held together by either type of bond will tend to [[Fracture#Brittle fracture|fracture]] before any [[plastic deformation]] takes place, which results in poor [[toughness]] in these materials. Additionally, because these materials tend to be porous, the [[porosity|pore]]s and other microscopic imperfections act as [[Stress concentration|stress concentrators]], decreasing the toughness further, and reducing the [[tensile strength]]. These combine to give [[catastrophic failure]]s, as opposed to the more ductile [[failure mode]]s of metals.\n\nThese materials do show [[plasticity (physics)|plastic deformation]]. However, because of the rigid structure of the crystalline materials, there are very few available [[slip system]]s for [[dislocation]]s to move, and so they deform very slowly. With the non-crystalline (glassy) materials, [[Viscosity|viscous]] flow is the dominant source of plastic deformation, and is also very slow. It is therefore neglected in many applications of ceramic materials.\n\nTo overcome the brittle behaviour, ceramic material development has introduced the class of [[ceramic matrix composite]] materials, in which ceramic fibers are embedded and with specific coatings are forming fiber bridges across any crack. This mechanism substantially increases the fracture toughness of such ceramics. Ceramic [[Disc brake|disc brakes]] are an example of using a ceramic matrix composite material manufactured with a specific process.\n\n==== Ice-templating for enhanced mechanical properties ====\nIf a ceramic will be subjected to substantial mechanical loading it can undergo a process called [[Freeze-casting|ice-templating]], which allows some control of the [[microstructure]] of the ceramic product and therefore some control of the mechanical properties. Ceramic engineers use this technique to tune the mechanical properties to their desired application. Specifically, [[Strength of materials|strength]] is increased when this technique is employed. Ice templating allows the creation of macroscopic pores in a unidirectional arrangement. The applications of this oxide strengthening technique are important for [[Solid oxide fuel cell|solid oxide fuel cells]] and [[Water purification|water filtration]] devices.{{clarify|reason=why is it important in these specific applications? why is it specifically an oxide strengthening technique?|date=December 2019}}{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\nTo process a sample through ice templating, an aqueous [[Colloid|colloidal suspension]] is prepared containing the dissolved ceramic powder evenly dispersed throughout the colloid,{{clarify|reason=is the powder in suspension or actually dissolved?|date=December 2019}} for example [[Yttria-stabilized zirconia]] (YSZ). The solution is then cooled from the bottom to the top on a platform that allows for unidirectional cooling. This forces [[ice]] crystals to grow in compliance to the unidirectional cooling, and these ice crystals force the dissolved YSZ particles to the solidification front of the solid-liquid interphase boundary, resulting in pure ice crystals lined up unidirectionally alongside concentrated pockets of colloidal particles. The sample is then simultaneously heated and the pressure is reduced enough to force the ice crystals to [[Sublimation (phase transition)|sublimate]] and the YSZ pockets begin to [[Annealing (metallurgy)|anneal]] together to form macroscopically aligned ceramic microstructures. The sample is then further [[Sintering|sintered]] to complete the [[evaporation]] of the residual water and the final consolidation of the ceramic microstructure.{{cn|date=December 2019}}\n\nDuring ice-templating a few variables can be controlled to influence the pore size and morphology of the microstructure. These important variables are the initial solids loading of the colloid, the cooling rate, the sintering temperature and duration, and the use of certain additives which can influence the micro-structural morphology during the process. A good understanding of these parameters is essential to understanding the relationships between processing, microstructure, and mechanical properties of anisotropically porous materials.<ref>Seuba, Jordi, Silvain Deville, Christian Guizard, and Adam J. Stevenson (14 April 2016).

Retrieved 9 October 2019.</ref>\n\n===Electrical properties===\n\n====Semiconductors====\nSome ceramics are [[semiconductor]]s. Most of these are [[transition metal oxides]] that are II-VI semiconductors, such as [[zinc oxide]].\n\nWhile there are prospects of mass-producing blue [[LED]]s from zinc oxide, ceramicists are most interested in the electrical properties that show [[grain boundary]] effects.\n\nOne of the most widely used of these is the varistor. These are devices that exhibit the property that resistance drops sharply at a certain [[threshold voltage]]. Once the voltage across the device reaches the threshold, there is a [[Electrical breakdown|breakdown]] of the electrical structure in the vicinity of the grain boundaries, which results in its [[electrical resistance]] dropping from several megohms down to a few hundred [[Ohm (unit)|ohm]]s. The major advantage of these is that they can dissipate a lot of energy, and they self-reset \u2013 after the voltage across the device drops below the threshold, its resistance returns to being high.\n\nThis makes them ideal for [[Surge protector|surge-protection]] applications; as there is control over the threshold voltage and energy tolerance, they find use in all sorts of applications. The best demonstration of their ability can be found in [[electrical substation]]s, where they are employed to protect the infrastructure from [[lightning]] strikes. They have rapid response, are low maintenance, and do not appreciably degrade from use, making them virtually ideal devices for this application.\n\nSemiconducting ceramics are also employed as [[gas sensor]]s. When various gases are passed over a polycrystalline ceramic, its electrical resistance changes. With tuning to the possible gas mixtures, very inexpensive devices can be produced.\n\n====Superconductivity====\n[[File:Magnet 4.jpg|thumb|The [[Meissner effect]] demonstrated by levitating a magnet above a cuprate superconductor, which is cooled by [[liquid nitrogen]]]]\nUnder some conditions, such as extremely low temperature, some ceramics exhibit [[high-temperature superconductivity]].{{clarify|reason=contradictory: why is it high-temperature superconductivity if extremely low temperatures are required? In superconductivity high temperature means above 30 K|date=December 2019}} The reason for this is not understood, but there are two major families of superconducting ceramics.\n\n====Ferroelectricity and supersets====\n[[Piezoelectricity]], a link between electrical and mechanical response, is exhibited by a large number of ceramic materials, including the quartz used to [[crystal oscillator|measure time]] in watches and other electronics. Such devices use both properties of piezoelectrics, using electricity to produce a mechanical motion (powering the device) and then using this mechanical motion to produce electricity (generating a signal). The unit of time measured is the natural interval required for electricity to be converted into mechanical energy and back again.\n\nThe piezoelectric effect is generally stronger in materials that also exhibit [[pyroelectricity]], and all pyroelectric materials are also piezoelectric. These materials can be used to inter-convert between thermal, mechanical, or electrical energy; for instance, after synthesis in a furnace, a pyroelectric crystal allowed to cool under no applied stress generally builds up a static charge of thousands of volts. Such materials are used in [[motion sensor]]s, where the tiny rise in temperature from a warm body entering the room is enough to produce a measurable voltage in the crystal.\n\nIn turn, pyroelectricity is seen most strongly in materials which also display the [[ferroelectric effect]], in which a stable electric dipole can be oriented or reversed by applying an electrostatic field.  Pyroelectricity is also a necessary consequence of ferroelectricity. This can be used to store information in [[ferroelectric capacitor]]s, elements of [[ferroelectric RAM]].\n\nThe most common such materials are [[lead zirconate titanate]] and [[barium titanate]]. Aside from the uses mentioned above, their strong piezoelectric response is exploited in the design of high-frequency [[loudspeaker]]s, transducers for [[sonar]], and actuators for [[atomic force microscope|atomic force]] and [[scanning tunneling microscope]]s.\n\n====Positive thermal coefficient====\n[[File:Si3N4thruster.jpg|thumb|left|Silicon nitride rocket thruster. Left: Mounted in test stand. Right: Being tested with H<sub>2</sub>/O<sub>2</sub> propellants]]\nIncreases in temperature can cause grain boundaries to suddenly become insulating in some semiconducting ceramic materials, mostly mixtures of [[heavy metals|heavy metal]] [[titanate]]s. The critical transition temperature can be adjusted over a wide range by variations in chemistry. In such materials, current will pass through the material until [[joule heating]] brings it to the transition temperature, at which point the circuit will be broken and current flow will cease. Such ceramics are used as self-controlled heating elements in, for example, the rear-window defrost circuits of automobiles.\n\nAt the transition temperature, the material's [[dielectric]] response becomes theoretically infinite. While a lack of temperature control would rule out any practical use of the material near its critical temperature, the dielectric effect remains exceptionally strong even at much higher temperatures. Titanates with critical temperatures far below room temperature have become synonymous with \"ceramic\" in the context of ceramic capacitors for just this reason.\n\n===Optical properties===\n[[File:cermax.jpg|thumb|150px|Cermax xenon arc lamp with synthetic sapphire output window]]\n[[Optics|Optically transparent materials]] focus on the response of a material to incoming lightwaves of a range of wavelengths. [[Optical filter|Frequency selective optical filters]] can be utilized to alter or enhance the brightness and contrast of a digital image. Guided lightwave transmission via frequency selective [[waveguides]] involves the emerging field of fiber [[optics]] and the ability of certain glassy compositions as a [[transmission medium]] for a range of frequencies simultaneously ([[multi-mode optical fiber]]) with little or no [[Adjacent-channel interference|interference]] between competing [[wavelengths]] or frequencies. This [[resonant]] [[Normal mode|mode]] of [[energy]] and [[data transmission]] via electromagnetic (light) [[wave propagation]], though low powered, is virtually lossless. Optical waveguides are used as components in [[Integrated optical circuit]]s (e.g. [[light-emitting diodes]], LEDs) or as the transmission medium in local and long haul [[optical communication]] systems. Also of value to the emerging materials scientist is the sensitivity of materials to radiation in the thermal [[infrared]] (IR) portion of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]]. This heat-seeking ability is responsible for such diverse optical phenomena as [[Night-vision]] and IR [[luminescence]].\n\nThus, there is an increasing need in the [[military]] sector for high-strength, robust materials which have the capability to [[transmit]] [[light]] ([[electromagnetic waves]]) in the [[visible spectrum|visible]] (0.4 \u2013 0.7 micrometers) and mid-[[infrared]] (1 \u2013 5 micrometers) regions of the spectrum. These materials are needed for applications requiring [[transparency and translucency|transparent]] armor, including next-generation high-speed [[missile]]s and pods, as well as protection against improvised explosive devices (IED).\n\nIn the 1960s, scientists at General Electric (GE) discovered that under the right manufacturing conditions, some ceramics, especially [[aluminium oxide]] (alumina), could be made [[translucent]]. These translucent materials were transparent enough to be used for containing the electrical [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] generated in high-[[pressure]] [[sodium]] street lamps. During the past two decades, additional types of transparent ceramics have been developed for applications such as nose cones for [[heat-seeking]] [[missiles]], [[window]]s for fighter [[aircraft]], and [[scintillation counter]]s for computed [[tomography]] scanners.\n\nIn the early 1970s, Thomas Soules pioneered computer modeling of light transmission through translucent ceramic alumina. His model showed that microscopic [[porosity|pores]] in ceramic, mainly trapped at the junctions of microcrystalline [[Crystallite|grains]], caused light to [[scattering|scatter]] and prevented true transparency. The volume fraction of these microscopic pores had to be less than 1% for high-quality optical transmission.\n\nThis is basically a [[particle size (grain size)|particle size]] effect. [[Opacity (optics)|Opacity]] results from the [[incoherent scattering]] of light at surfaces and [[Interface (chemistry)|interfaces]]. In addition to pores, most of the interfaces in a typical metal or ceramic object are in the form of [[grain boundaries]] which separate tiny regions of crystalline order. When the size of the scattering center (or grain boundary) is reduced below the size of the wavelength of the light being scattered, the scattering no longer occurs to any significant extent.\n\nIn the formation of [[polycrystalline]] materials ([[metals]] and ceramics) the size of the [[crystalline]] grains is determined largely by the size of the crystalline [[wiktionary:Particles|particles]] present in the raw material during formation (or pressing) of the object. Moreover, the size of the [[grain boundaries]] scales directly with particle size. Thus a reduction of the original particle size below the [[wavelength]] of [[visible light]] (~ 0.5 micrometers for shortwave violet) eliminates any light [[scattering]], resulting in a [[transparency and translucency|transparent]] material.\n\nRecently{{When|date=March 2011}}, Japanese scientists have developed techniques to produce ceramic parts that rival the [[Transparency and translucency|transparency]] of traditional crystals (grown from a single seed) and exceed the [[fracture toughness]] of a single crystal.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}} In particular, scientists at the Japanese firm Konoshima Ltd., a producer of ceramic construction materials and industrial chemicals, have been looking for markets for their transparent ceramics.\n\nLivermore researchers realized that these ceramics might greatly benefit high-powered [[lasers]] used in the National Ignition Facility (NIF) Programs Directorate. In particular, a Livermore research team began to acquire advanced transparent ceramics from Konoshima to determine if they could meet the [[optical]] requirements needed for Livermore's Solid-State Heat Capacity Laser (SSHCL).{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://str.llnl.gov/content/pages/past-issues-pdfs/2006.04.pdf|title=Flexible Stress Sensing|last=Heller|first=Arnie|date=April 2006|website=Science and Technology Review|url-status=live}}</ref> Livermore researchers have also been testing applications of these materials for applications such as advanced drivers for laser-driven [[Nuclear fusion|fusion]] power plants.\n\n==Examples==\n[[File:Insulator.jpg|thumb|upright|Porcelain high-voltage insulator]]\n[[File:Bodyarmor.jpg|thumb|upright|Silicon carbide is used for inner plates of [[ballistic vest]]s]]\n[[File:BNcrucible.jpg|thumb|upright|Ceramic BN crucible]]\n\nA [[composite material]] of ceramic and [[metal]] is known as [[cermet]].\n\nOther ceramic materials, generally requiring greater purity in their make-up than those above, include forms of several chemical compounds, including:\n\n*[[Barium titanate]] (often mixed with [[strontium titanate]]) displays [[ferroelectricity]], meaning that its mechanical, electrical, and thermal responses are coupled to one another and also history-dependent.

Such plates are known commonly as [[Small Arms Protective Insert|small arms protective insert]]s, or SAPIs. Similar material is used to protect the [[Cockpit (aviation)|cockpits]] of some military airplanes, because of the low weight of the material.\n*Ceramics can be used in place of steel for [[ball bearing]]s. Their higher hardness means they are much less susceptible to wear and typically last for triple the lifetime of a steel part. They also deform less under load, meaning they have less contact with the bearing retainer walls and can roll faster. In very high speed applications, heat from [[friction]] during rolling can cause problems for metal bearings, which are reduced by the use of ceramics. Ceramics are also more chemically resistant and can be used in wet environments where steel bearings would rust. In some cases, their electricity-insulating properties may also be valuable in bearings. Two drawbacks to ceramic bearings are a significantly higher cost and susceptibility to damage under shock loads.\n*In the early 1980s, [[Toyota]] researched production of an [[adiabatic]] [[internal combustion engine|engine]] using ceramic components in the hot gas area. The ceramics would have allowed temperatures of over 3000&nbsp;\u00b0F (1650&nbsp;\u00b0C). The expected advantages would have been lighter materials and a smaller cooling system (or no need for one at all), leading to a major weight reduction. The expected increase of [[fuel efficiency]] of the engine (caused by the higher temperature, as shown by [[Carnot heat engine|Carnot's]] theorem) could not be verified experimentally; it was found that the heat transfer on the hot ceramic cylinder walls was higher than the transfer to a cooler metal wall as the cooler gas film on the metal surface works as a [[thermal insulator]]. Thus, despite all of these desirable properties, such engines have not succeeded in production because of costs for the ceramic components and the limited advantages. (Small imperfections in the ceramic material with its low [[fracture toughness]] lead to cracks, which can lead to potentially dangerous equipment failure.) Such engines are possible in laboratory settings, but mass production is not feasible with current technology. {{Citation needed|date=July 2009|reason=Where are any other references to Toyota's work?}}\n*Work is being done in developing ceramic parts for [[gas turbine]] [[heat engine|engines]]. Currently, even blades made of [[superalloy|advanced metal alloys]] used in the engines' hot section require cooling and careful limiting of operating temperatures. Turbine engines made with ceramics could operate more efficiently, giving aircraft greater range and payload for a set amount of fuel.\n*Recent advances have been made in ceramics which include [[bioceramic]]s, such as dental implants and synthetic bones. [[Hydroxyapatite]], the natural mineral component of bone, has been made synthetically from a number of biological and chemical sources and can be formed into ceramic materials. Orthopedic implants coated with these materials bond readily to bone and other tissues in the body without rejection or inflammatory reactions so are of great interest for gene delivery and [[tissue engineering]] scaffolds. Most hydroxyapatite ceramics are very porous and lack mechanical strength, and are used to coat metal orthopedic devices to aid in forming a bond to bone or as bone fillers. They are also used as fillers for orthopedic plastic screws to aid in reducing the inflammation and increase absorption of these plastic materials. Work is being done to make strong, fully dense nanocrystalline hydroxyapatite ceramic materials for orthopedic weight bearing devices, replacing foreign metal and plastic orthopedic materials with a synthetic, but naturally occurring, bone mineral. Ultimately, these ceramic materials may be used as bone replacements or with the incorporation of protein [[collagen]]s, synthetic bones.\n*Durable actinide-containing ceramic materials have many applications such as in nuclear fuels for burning excess Pu and in chemically-inert sources of alpha irradiation for power supply of unmanned space vehicles or to produce electricity for microelectronic devices. Both use and disposal of radioactive actinides require their immobilisation in a durable host material. Nuclear waste long-lived radionuclides such as actinides are immobilised using chemically-durable crystalline materials based on polycrystalline ceramics and large single crystals.<ref>B.E.

Completed in the 1710s, it forms a half-length group portrait, possibly the rarest case in Watteau's body of work, and has been given various interpretatons; some scholars believe it to be a depiction of [[commedia dell'arte masks]], while some others believe it to be a depiction of members of the [[Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise]]. Because of that, the painting has been known under a number of various titles; its traditional naming in Western scholarship, ''Coquettes qui pour voir'', is derived from anonymous verses which the painting was featured with in [[Jean de Jullienne]]'s [[Recueil Jullienne|four-volume collection]] of engravings after Watteau's works.  \n\nBy the middle of the 18th century, ''Coquettes'' belonged to {{ill|Louis-Antoine Crozat, Baron de Thiers|fr|Louis Antoine Crozat}}, a nephew of the Parisian merchant and art collector [[Pierre Crozat]]; after his death in 1770, the painting, along with a most part of the collection he owned, was acquired for [[Catherine II of Russia]] in 1772. Since then the painting was held among the Russian imperial family collections in the Hermitage and, after the 1850s, in the [[Gatchina Palace]]; in 1920, it was transitioned in the Winter Palace, where it currently remains as part of the Hermitage Museum permanent exhibition. In Russian literature, the painting is currently known as '''''Actors of the Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise'''''{{efn|{{lang-ru|\u00ab\u0410\u043a\u0442\u0451\u0440\u044b \u0444\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0446\u0443\u0437\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0442\u0435\u0430\u0442\u0440\u0430\u00bb}}; adopted into French as ''Acteurs de la Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise''<ref name=bordeaux1980/> or ''Les comediens fran\u00e7ais''.{{sfn|Zolotov|1985|p=98}}}}, following studies of Watteau's drawings that established a possible identity.\n\n==Description==\n===Composition===\n{{quote box|align=left|width=25%|quote=\"\u2026Watteau combines portraiture with a striking feeling for the picturesque.

The faces, showing fatigue, animation and faint anxiety, are illuminated by a mysterious theatrical light, the fantastic costumes shimmer with wine-pink tones against the black velvet of the masks.

To the right, an outwardly old man stands upon a stick and holds a mushroom hat, dressed in a skullcap. By the balustrade's other side, a young girl is shown in a light-colored striped dress with high standing collar, standing behind a black boy in green-striped clothes. Over the girl's shoulder, a man's head appears in a large motley beret. To the left side, a young woman turned to the right in profile, appears in a Polish-styled red dress and white chipper, leaning on the balustrade and holding a black mask in the right hand.{{sfn|Nemilova|1964|p=181}}\n\nDefects found on the panel include a restored crack to the right of the old man's cape; gaps in shadows, more importantly at the bottom edge and around the girl's head; chippings painted over the girl's left shoulder.{{sfn|Nemilova|1964|p=181}} An X-ray analysis published by Soviet scholars in 1973 revealed changes in the composition showing that in the early stages the woman at the left was bareheaded, wore a different costume, and had placed her mask on the balustrade. The several differences between the painting and the engraving, notably in the coiffure of the central female figure, are considered relating to the state of the painting, which has been somewhat damaged and restored in the past.{{sfnm|Zolotov|1973|1p=138|Nemilova|1982|2pp=130\u2013131|3a1=Grasselli|3a2=Rosenberg|3a3=Parmantier|3y=1984|3p=312}}\n\n<!--[[Donald Posner]] described ''Actors'' less successful in its idea and composition, while having beautiful painting of individual forms.{{sfn|Posner|1984|p=290}}-->\n\n===Identity of subjects===\n[[File:Henri Simon Thomassin - Coquettes qui pour voir galans au rendez-vous.jpg|thumb|The painting's traditional naming originates from {{Interlanguage link|Henri Simon Thomassin|lt=Henri Simon Thomassin's|fr}} engraving, executed for the ''Recueil Jullienne''.]]\nUntil the middle of the 20th century, sources and studies on Watteau variously defined the work's subject.

Completed in the 1710s, it forms a half-length group portrait, possibly the rarest case in Watteau's body of work, and has been given various interpretatons; some scholars believe it to be a depiction of [[commedia dell'arte masks]], while some others believe it to be a depiction of members of the [[Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise]]. Because of that, the painting has been known under a number of various titles; its traditional naming in Western scholarship, ''Coquettes qui pour voir'', is derived from anonymous verses which the painting was featured with in [[Jean de Jullienne]]'s [[Recueil Jullienne|four-volume collection]] of engravings after Watteau's works.  \n\nBy the middle of the 18th century, ''Coquettes'' belonged to {{ill|Louis-Antoine Crozat, Baron de Thiers|fr|Louis Antoine Crozat}}, a nephew of the Parisian merchant and art collector [[Pierre Crozat]]; after his death in 1770, the painting, along with a most part of the collection he owned, was acquired for [[Catherine II of Russia]] in 1772. Since then the painting was held among the Russian imperial family collections in the Hermitage and, after the 1850s, in the [[Gatchina Palace]]; in 1920, it was transitioned in the Winter Palace, where it currently remains as part of the Hermitage Museum permanent exhibition. In Russian literature, the painting is currently known as '''''Actors of the Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise'''''{{efn|{{lang-ru|\u00ab\u0410\u043a\u0442\u0451\u0440\u044b \u0444\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0446\u0443\u0437\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0433\u043e \u0442\u0435\u0430\u0442\u0440\u0430\u00bb}}; adopted into French as ''Acteurs de la Com\u00e9die-Fran\u00e7aise''<ref name=bordeaux1980/> or ''Les comediens fran\u00e7ais''.{{sfn|Zolotov|1985|p=98}}}}, following studies of Watteau's drawings that established a possible identity.\n\n==Description==\n===Composition===\n{{quote box|align=left|width=25%|quote=\"\u2026Watteau combines portraiture with a striking feeling for the picturesque. The rounded, resilient brushstrokes seem to have benn applied with the lightness of spontaneous improvisation, yet at the same time with a bold precision which only a mature master could command. The faces, showing fatigue, animation and faint anxiety, are illuminated by a mysterious theatrical light, the fantastic costumes shimmer with wine-pink tones against the black velvet of the masks.

To the right, an outwardly old man stands upon a stick and holds a mushroom hat, dressed in a skullcap. By the balustrade's other side, a young girl is shown in a light-colored striped dress with high standing collar, standing behind a black boy in green-striped clothes. Over the girl's shoulder, a man's head appears in a large motley beret. To the left side, a young woman turned to the right in profile, appears in a Polish-styled red dress and white chipper, leaning on the balustrade and holding a black mask in the right hand.{{sfn|Nemilova|1964|p=181}}\n\nDefects found on the panel include a restored crack to the right of the old man's cape; gaps in shadows, more importantly at the bottom edge and around the girl's head; chippings painted over the girl's left shoulder.{{sfn|Nemilova|1964|p=181}} An X-ray analysis published by Soviet scholars in 1973 revealed changes in the composition showing that in the early stages the woman at the left was bareheaded, wore a different costume, and had placed her mask on the balustrade. The several differences between the painting and the engraving, notably in the coiffure of the central female figure, are considered relating to the state of the painting, which has been somewhat damaged and restored in the past.{{sfnm|Zolotov|1973|1p=138|Nemilova|1982|2pp=130\u2013131|3a1=Grasselli|3a2=Rosenberg|3a3=Parmantier|3y=1984|3p=312}}\n\n<!--[[Donald Posner]] described ''Actors'' less successful in its idea and composition, while having beautiful painting of individual forms.{{sfn|Posner|1984|p=290}}-->\n\n===Identity of subjects===\n[[File:Henri Simon Thomassin - Coquettes qui pour voir galans au rendez-vous.jpg|thumb|The painting's traditional naming originates from {{Interlanguage link|Henri Simon Thomassin|lt=Henri Simon Thomassin's|fr}} engraving, executed for the ''Recueil Jullienne''.]]\nUntil the middle of the 20th century, sources and studies on Watteau variously defined the work's subject.

Eastern State's revolutionary system of incarceration, dubbed the \"Pennsylvania system\" or [[separate system]],  encouraged separate confinement as a form of rehabilitation. The warden was legally required to visit every inmate every day, and the overseers were mandated to see each inmate three times a day.\n\nThe Pennsylvania system was opposed contemporaneously by the [[Auburn system]] (also known as the New York system), which held that prisoners should be forced to work together in silence, and could be subjected to physical punishment ([[Sing Sing Correctional Facility|Sing Sing]] prison was an example of the Auburn system). Although the Auburn system was favored in the United States, Eastern State's radial floor plan and system of solitary confinement was the model for over 300 prisons worldwide.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nOriginally, inmates were housed in cells that could only be accessed by entering through a small exercise yard attached to the back of the prison; only a small portal, just large enough to pass meals, opened onto the cell blocks. This design proved impractical, and in the middle of construction, cells were constructed that allowed prisoners to enter and leave the cell blocks through metal doors that were covered by a heavy wooden door to filter out noise. The halls were designed to have the feel of a [[Church (building)|church]].<ref name=\"treasuresofpa.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.treasuresofpa.com/2009/11/esp |title=Eastern State Penitentiary \u2013 Treasures of Pennsylvania |website=Treasuresofpa.com |date=November 28, 2009 |accessdate=May 4, 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160403150355/http://www.treasuresofpa.com/2009/11/esp/ |archivedate=April 3, 2016 }}</ref>\n\nSome believe that the doors were small so prisoners would have a harder time getting out, minimizing an attack on an officer. Others have explained the small doors forced the prisoners to bow while entering their cell. This design is related to penance and ties to the religious inspiration of the prison. The cells were made of concrete with a single glass [[Skylight (window)|skylight]], representing the \"Eye of God\", suggesting to the prisoners that God was always watching them.<ref name=\"treasuresofpa.com\"/>\n\nOutside the cell was an individual area for exercise, enclosed by high walls so prisoners could not communicate. Exercise time for each prisoner was synchronized so no two prisoners next to each other would be out at the same time. Prisoners were allowed to garden and even keep pets in their exercise yards. When a prisoner left his cell, an accompanying guard would wrap a hood over his head to prevent him from being recognized by other prisoners.<ref name=\"treasuresofpa.com\"/>\n\nCell accommodations were advanced for their time, including a faucet with running water over a flush toilet, as well as curved pipes along part of one wall which served as central heating during the winter months where hot water would be run through the pipes to keep the cells reasonably heated. Toilets were remotely flushed twice a week by the guards of the cellblock.\n\n[[File:Eastern State Penitentiary, Two Story Hall.jpg|thumb|right|One of the two-story cell blocks in Eastern State Penitentiary]]\nThe original design of the building was for seven one-story cell blocks, but by the time cell block three was completed, the prison was already over capacity. All subsequent cell blocks had two floors. Toward the end, cell blocks 14 and 15 were hastily built due to overcrowding. They were built and designed by prisoners. Cell block 15 was for the worst behaved prisoners, and the guards were gated off from there entirely.\n\nInmates were punished with the \"individual-treatment system.\"  At the time this form of punishment was thought to be most effective.  They would be separated from others.<ref>Vaux, Richard, 1816-1895. \"Brief sketch of the origin and history of the State Penitentiary for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, at Philadelphia.\" 2010.</ref>\n\nIn 1924, Pennsylvania Governor [[Gifford Pinchot]] allegedly sentenced Pep \"The Cat-Murdering Dog\" (an actual dog) to a life sentence at Eastern State. Pep allegedly murdered the governor's wife's cherished cat. Prison records reflect that Pep was assigned an inmate number (no. C2559), which is seen in his mug shot. However, the reason for Pep's incarceration remains a subject of some debate. A contemporary newspaper article reported that the governor donated his own dog to the prison to increase inmate morale.<ref name=\"esp history\"/>\n\nOn April 3, 1945, a major escape was carried out by twelve inmates (including the infamous [[Willie Sutton]]), who over the course of a year managed to dig an undiscovered {{convert|97|ft|m|adj=on}} tunnel under the prison wall.  During renovations in the 1930s an additional 30 incomplete inmate-dug tunnels were discovered.\n\nIt was designated a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1965.<ref name=\"nhlsum\"/><ref name=\"nrhpinv2\">{{Cite journal|url={{NHLS url|id=66000680}}|title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory-Nomination: Eastern State Penintentiary|date=August 6, 1974 |format=PDF |author=Richard E.

Many prisoners and guards were transferred to [[State Correctional Institution - Graterford|Graterford Prison]], about {{convert|31|mi|km}} northwest of Eastern State. The City of Philadelphia purchased the property with the intention of redeveloping it. The site had several proposals, including a mall and a luxury apartment complex surrounded by the old prison walls.\n\nDuring the abandoned era (from closing until the late 80s) a \"forest\" grew in the cell blocks and outside within the walls. The prison also became home to many stray cats.\n\nIn 1988, the Eastern State Penitentiary Task Force successfully petitioned Mayor [[Wilson Goode]] to halt redevelopment. In 1994, Eastern State opened to the public for history tours.\n\n=== End of the solitary confinement system ===\n[[File:ESP-cell.jpg|thumb|250px|A typical cell in restored condition.]]\nThe solitary confinement system eventually collapsed due to overcrowding problems. By 1913, Eastern State officially abandoned the solitary system and operated as a congregate prison until it closed in 1970 (Eastern State was briefly used to house city inmates in 1971 after a riot at [[Holmesburg]] Prison).\n\n[[File:Al-capone-cell.jpg|thumb|250px|Al Capone's cell.]]\n[[File:Eastern State Penitentiary, Philadelphia, PA barber shop.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The remains of the barber shop.]]\n\nThe prison was one of the largest public-works projects of the early republic, and was a tourist destination in the 19th century.  Notable visitors included [[Charles Dickens]] and [[Alexis de Tocqueville]] while notable inmates included [[Willie Sutton]] and [[Al Capone]] in 1929. Visitors spoke with prisoners in their cells, proving that inmates were not isolated, though the prisoners themselves were not allowed to have any visits with family or friends during their stay.\n\nMost of the early prisoners were petty criminals incarcerated for various robbery and theft charges (muggers, pickpockets, purse-snatchers, burglars, etc.) and the first-time offenders often served two years.\n\nThe Penitentiary was intended not simply to punish, but to move the criminal toward spiritual reflection and change. While some have argued that the Pennsylvania system was [[Religious Society of Friends|Quaker]]-inspired, there is little evidence to support this; the organization that promoted Eastern State's creation, the Society for Alleviating the Miseries of Public Prisons (today's [[Pennsylvania Prison Society]]) was less than half Quaker, and was led for nearly fifty years by Philadelphia's Anglican bishop, [[William White (Bishop of Pennsylvania)|William White]]. Proponents of the system believed strongly that the criminals, exposed, in silence, to thoughts of their behavior and the ugliness of their crimes, would become genuinely penitent.\n\nIn reality, the guards and councilors of the facility designed a variety of physical and psychological torture regimens for various infractions, including dousing prisoners in freezing water outside during winter months, chaining their tongues to their wrists in a fashion such that struggling against the chains could cause the tongue to tear, strapping prisoners into chairs with tight leather restraints for days on end, and putting the worst behaved prisoners into a pit called \"The Hole\", an underground cellblock dug under cellblock 14 where they would have no light, no human contact, and little food for as long as two weeks.\n\n===Prison reform and rehabilitation===\n[[SCI Graterford]] opened in the 1920s after disturbances occurred at Eastern State; the Pennsylvania prison board opened Graterford to assume functions previously held by Eastern State.<ref>\"[https://web.archive.org/web/20180324042618/https://www.cor.pa.gov/Facilities/StatePrisons/Pages/Graterford.aspx SCI Graterford].\" [[Pennsylvania Department of Corrections]].

Retrieved on September 27, 2018.</ref>\n\nPrior to its closing in late 1969, Eastern State Penitentiary (then known as '''State Correctional Institution, Philadelphia''') had established a far reaching program of group therapy with the goal of having all inmates involved. From 1967, when the plan was initiated, the program appears to have been moderately successful as many inmates were involved in the groups which were voluntary. An interesting aspect was that the groups were led by two therapists, one from the psych or social work staff, and the second from the prison officer staff.<ref>Prison Manifesto. {{ISBN|0-9769715-0-X}}.

Eastern State Penitentiary: Crucible of Good Intentions. Philadelphia: Philadelphia Museum of Art, 1994.</ref> Its architectural significance first arose in 1821, when British architect [[John Haviland]] was chosen to design the building. Haviland found most of his inspiration for his plan for the penitentiary from prisons and asylums built beginning in the 1780s in England and Ireland.<ref name=\"penitentiary1994\"/> He gave the prison a neo-Gothic look to instill fear into those who thought of committing a crime.<ref name=\"DolanESP\">{{cite book | title=Eastern State Penitentiary | publisher=Arcadia Publications | author=Dolan, Francis X. | year=2007 | location=Charleston, SC}}</ref>\n\nThese complexes consist of cell wings radiating in a semi or full circle array from a center tower whence the prison could be kept under constant surveillance. The design for the penitentiary which Haviland devised became known as the hub-and-spoke plan which consisted of an octagonal center connected by corridors to seven radiating single-story cell blocks, each containing two ranges of large single cells\u20148 x 12 feet x 10 feet high- with hot water heating, a water tap, toilet, and individual exercise yards the same width as the cell.<ref name=\"penitentiary1994\"/>\n\nThere were rectangular openings in the cell wall through which food and work materials could be passed to the prisoner, as well as peepholes for guards to observe prisoners without being seen. To minimize the opportunities for communication between inmates Haviland designed a basic flush toilet for each cell with individual pipes leading to a central sewer which he hoped would prevent the sending of messages between adjacent cells.<ref name=\"penitentiary1994\"/>\n\nDespite his efforts, prisoners were still able to communicate with each other and the flushing system had to be redesigned several times. Haviland remarked that he chose the design to promote \"watching, convenience, economy, and ventilation\".<ref>Norman Johnson, Crucible of Good Intentions:35</ref> Once construction of the prison was completed in 1836, it could house 450 prisoners.<ref>Johnston, Norman. The Human Cage: A Brief History of Prison Architecture. New York: Walker and Company, 1973.</ref>\n\nHaviland completed the architecture of the Eastern state penitentiary in 1836. Each cell was lit only by a single lighting source from either skylights or windows, which was considered the \"Window of God\" or \"Eye of God\". The church viewed imprisonment, usually in isolation, as an instrument that would modify sinful or disruptive behavior. The time spent in prison would help inmates reflect on their crimes committed, giving them the mission for redemption.\n\n==Modern-day historic site==\n\nThe Eastern State Penitentiary operates as a museum and historic site, open year-round. Guided tours are offered during the winter, and during the warmer months, self-guided recorded tours with headphones are also available (narrated mainly by [[Steve Buscemi]], with former guards, wardens and prisoners also contributing). A scavenger hunt is available for children.\n\nVisitors are allowed to walk into several specially marked solitary confinement cells, but most of them remain off limits and filled with original rubble and debris from years of neglect. The city skyline of Philadelphia is visible from the prison courtyard, which still has the original baseball backstop and a chain link fence atop the \"outfield wall,\" the outer prison wall, to attempt to keep home run balls inside the grounds. There is also a camera located in the center guard tower, that lets visitors experience a correctional officer view of the prison.\n\nIn addition, Eastern State holds many special events throughout the year. Each July, there is a [[Bastille Day]] celebration, complete with a comedic reinterpretation of the storming of the Bastille and the tossing of thousands of [[Tastykake]]s from the towers,<ref>{{cite news|author=Dobrzynsky, Judith H.|title=For a Summer Getaway, A Model Prison|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=July 11, 2007|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F00E0D91039F932A25754C0A961958260&sec=travel&spon=&pagewanted=2M|accessdate=May 4, 2016}}</ref> accompanied by a cry of \"let them eat Tastykake!\" from an actor portraying Marie Antoinette.\n\nThe museum attracts close to 220,000 visitors each year.<ref name=\"Lussenhop\">{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-36163247|title=Inside decaying US prison, former inmates are guides|last=Lussenhop|first=Jessica|date=May 11, 2016|work=[[BBC Online]]|accessdate=May 11, 2016}}</ref>\n\nReligious murals in the prison chaplain's office, painted in 1955 by inmate Lester Smith, remain visible to guests despite damage from exposure to sunlight.<ref name=\"Lussenhop\" />\n\nThe tour ends with an exhibit titled \"Prisons Today: Questions in the Age of Mass Incarceration\" which informs guests about the US prison system today and its failings.<ref name=\"Lussenhop\" />\n\n===Restoration===\nThe facility was kept in \"[[arrested decay|preserved ruin]]\", meaning no significant renovation or restoration was attempted, until 1991, when [[The Pew Charitable Trusts]] provided funding so that stabilization and preservation efforts could begin.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.easternstate.org/learn/timeline |title=Timeline &#124; Eastern State Penitentiary |website=Easternstate.org |date=August 20, 1929 |accessdate=May 4, 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160425031932/http://www.easternstate.org/learn/timeline |archivedate=April 25, 2016 }}</ref>\n\n====Fundraising and projects====\n* '''Perimeter Lighting''': In 2001, the Perimeter Lighting project, funded by the Department of Community and Economic Development ($250,000), and the 2000 Halloween Fundraiser ($50,000) were completed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.easternstate.org/support/completed-projects/perimeter-lighting |title=Perimeter Lighting &#124; Eastern State Penitentiary |website=Easternstate.org |accessdate=May 4, 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160418124429/http://www.easternstate.org/support/completed-projects/perimeter-lighting |archivedate=April 18, 2016 }}</ref>\n* '''Rotunda and Links Roofing''': In 2002, the Rotunda and Links Roofing project, funded by [[National Trust for Historic Preservation|Save America's Treasures Award]] ($500,000), now defunded, the City of Philadelphia ($355,000), the Keystone Historic Preservation ($90,000), and the 2002 Halloween Fundraiser ($55,000) was completed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.easternstate.org/support/completed-projects/rotunda-and-links-roofing |title=Rotunda and Links Roofing &#124; Eastern State Penitentiary |website=Easternstate.org |accessdate=May 4, 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160418124241/http://www.easternstate.org/support/completed-projects/rotunda-and-links-roofing |archivedate=April 18, 2016 }}</ref>\n* '''Industrial Building Stabilization''': In 2003, the Industrial Building Stabilization project, funded by the Eastern State Penitentiary Board of Directors, Senator Vincent J.

They are scattered around cell block seven.\n* '''GTMO''' \u2013 A replica of a [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp]] cell was set up by artist William Cromar inside one of the cells.\n* '''Midway of Another Day''' \u2013 A metal [[sundial]] set up to show \"the passing of time\" by Michael Grothusen in the courtyard of cell block one.\n* '''I always wanted to go to [[Paris, France]]''' \u2013 Artist Alexa Hoyer set up three TVs, one in a cell, one in a hallway, and one in a shower room, showing seven decades of prison films.

The goal was to create photographs which are contemplative. By allowing the public to see the gradual effects of time upon specific places, growth and decay are recognized and explored as components that make Eastern State Penitentiary a more living space.\n[[File:Eastern State Penitentiary Purge Incomplete.jpg|thumb|right|Purge Incomplete, Mary Jo Bole's exhibit]]\n* '''Purge Incomplete''' \u2013 [[Mary Jo Bole]]'s exhibit explores the history of plumbing at the penitentiary.

Consisting of sculptural pieces made of resin, brass, and frosted glass, Bole's designs are modeled after John Haviland's original design for the plumbing at Eastern State Penitentiary. The exhibit includes views of the plumbing from the vantage point of those residing or working at the prison, including that of the prisoners, prison guards, and the manufacturers of the plumbing. Additionally, the exhibit showcases the sculptures as having both opaque and translucent factors, in which the translucent parts glow within the cells.\n\n==Cultural references==\n[[File:Gargoyle 2, Exterior of Eastern State Penitentiary, 2006.JPG|thumb|right | Fake gargoyle on the exterior of the Eastern State Penitentiary for the [[Halloween]]-themed \"Terror Behind the Walls\" haunted attraction]]\nDue to its ominous appearance, gloomy atmosphere, and long history, Eastern State has been used as a location for television programs and films about [[haunting]]s. [[Paranormal TV]] shows like ''[[Ghost Hunters (TV series)|Ghost Hunters]]'', ''[[Ghost Adventures]]'', [[BuzzFeed Unsolved]]<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHXLbp7x3MM</ref> and ''[[MTV's Fear]]'' explored the [[paranormal]] at Eastern State.

In the [[PlayStation 2]] game, ''[[The Suffering (game)|The Suffering]]'', players can find a video documentary of Eastern State Penitentary, one of the inspirations for the game.\n\nEastern State has also served as a location in several feature films. [[Terry Gilliam]]'s 1995 film ''[[12 Monkeys (film)|Twelve Monkeys]]'' used it as the setting for a mental hospital. The 1998 film [[Return to Paradise (1998 film)|''Return to Paradise'']] used it as a substitute for a prison in Malaysia.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0124595/locations?ref_=tt_dt_dt |website=IMDB |accessdate=July 12, 2018|title=Return to Paradise (1998) }}</ref>  The 2000 film ''[[Animal Factory]]'', directed by [[Steve Buscemi]] relied heavily on Eastern State in its portrayal of a prison in a state of advancing decay.

Eastern State's revolutionary system of incarceration, dubbed the \"Pennsylvania system\" or [[separate system]],  encouraged separate confinement as a form of rehabilitation. The warden was legally required to visit every inmate every day, and the overseers were mandated to see each inmate three times a day.\n\nThe Pennsylvania system was opposed contemporaneously by the [[Auburn system]] (also known as the New York system), which held that prisoners should be forced to work together in silence, and could be subjected to physical punishment ([[Sing Sing Correctional Facility|Sing Sing]] prison was an example of the Auburn system). Although the Auburn system was favored in the United States, Eastern State's radial floor plan and system of solitary confinement was the model for over 300 prisons worldwide.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}\n\nOriginally, inmates were housed in cells that could only be accessed by entering through a small exercise yard attached to the back of the prison; only a small portal, just large enough to pass meals, opened onto the cell blocks. This design proved impractical, and in the middle of construction, cells were constructed that allowed prisoners to enter and leave the cell blocks through metal doors that were covered by a heavy wooden door to filter out noise. The halls were designed to have the feel of a [[Church (building)|church]].<ref name=\"treasuresofpa.com\">{{cite web |url=http://www.treasuresofpa.com/2009/11/esp |title=Eastern State Penitentiary \u2013 Treasures of Pennsylvania |website=Treasuresofpa.com |date=November 28, 2009 |accessdate=May 4, 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160403150355/http://www.treasuresofpa.com/2009/11/esp/ |archivedate=April 3, 2016 }}</ref>\n\nSome believe that the doors were small so prisoners would have a harder time getting out, minimizing an attack on an officer. Others have explained the small doors forced the prisoners to bow while entering their cell. This design is related to penance and ties to the religious inspiration of the prison. The cells were made of concrete with a single glass [[Skylight (window)|skylight]], representing the \"Eye of God\", suggesting to the prisoners that God was always watching them.<ref name=\"treasuresofpa.com\"/>\n\nOutside the cell was an individual area for exercise, enclosed by high walls so prisoners could not communicate. Exercise time for each prisoner was synchronized so no two prisoners next to each other would be out at the same time. Prisoners were allowed to garden and even keep pets in their exercise yards. When a prisoner left his cell, an accompanying guard would wrap a hood over his head to prevent him from being recognized by other prisoners.<ref name=\"treasuresofpa.com\"/>\n\nCell accommodations were advanced for their time, including a faucet with running water over a flush toilet, as well as curved pipes along part of one wall which served as central heating during the winter months where hot water would be run through the pipes to keep the cells reasonably heated. Toilets were remotely flushed twice a week by the guards of the cellblock.\n\n[[File:Eastern State Penitentiary, Two Story Hall.jpg|thumb|right|One of the two-story cell blocks in Eastern State Penitentiary]]\nThe original design of the building was for seven one-story cell blocks, but by the time cell block three was completed, the prison was already over capacity. All subsequent cell blocks had two floors. Toward the end, cell blocks 14 and 15 were hastily built due to overcrowding. They were built and designed by prisoners. Cell block 15 was for the worst behaved prisoners, and the guards were gated off from there entirely.\n\nInmates were punished with the \"individual-treatment system.\"  At the time this form of punishment was thought to be most effective.  They would be separated from others.<ref>Vaux, Richard, 1816-1895. \"Brief sketch of the origin and history of the State Penitentiary for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania, at Philadelphia.\" 2010.</ref>\n\nIn 1924, Pennsylvania Governor [[Gifford Pinchot]] allegedly sentenced Pep \"The Cat-Murdering Dog\" (an actual dog) to a life sentence at Eastern State. Pep allegedly murdered the governor's wife's cherished cat. Prison records reflect that Pep was assigned an inmate number (no. C2559), which is seen in his mug shot. However, the reason for Pep's incarceration remains a subject of some debate. A contemporary newspaper article reported that the governor donated his own dog to the prison to increase inmate morale.<ref name=\"esp history\"/>\n\nOn April 3, 1945, a major escape was carried out by twelve inmates (including the infamous [[Willie Sutton]]), who over the course of a year managed to dig an undiscovered {{convert|97|ft|m|adj=on}} tunnel under the prison wall.  During renovations in the 1930s an additional 30 incomplete inmate-dug tunnels were discovered.\n\nIt was designated a [[National Historic Landmark]] in 1965.<ref name=\"nhlsum\"/><ref name=\"nrhpinv2\">{{Cite journal|url={{NHLS url|id=66000680}}|title=National Register of Historic Places Inventory-Nomination: Eastern State Penintentiary|date=August 6, 1974 |format=PDF |author=Richard E.

Many prisoners and guards were transferred to [[State Correctional Institution - Graterford|Graterford Prison]], about {{convert|31|mi|km}} northwest of Eastern State. The City of Philadelphia purchased the property with the intention of redeveloping it. The site had several proposals, including a mall and a luxury apartment complex surrounded by the old prison walls.\n\nDuring the abandoned era (from closing until the late 80s) a \"forest\" grew in the cell blocks and outside within the walls. The prison also became home to many stray cats.\n\nIn 1988, the Eastern State Penitentiary Task Force successfully petitioned Mayor [[Wilson Goode]] to halt redevelopment. In 1994, Eastern State opened to the public for history tours.\n\n=== End of the solitary confinement system ===\n[[File:ESP-cell.jpg|thumb|250px|A typical cell in restored condition.]]\nThe solitary confinement system eventually collapsed due to overcrowding problems. By 1913, Eastern State officially abandoned the solitary system and operated as a congregate prison until it closed in 1970 (Eastern State was briefly used to house city inmates in 1971 after a riot at [[Holmesburg]] Prison).\n\n[[File:Al-capone-cell.jpg|thumb|250px|Al Capone's cell.]]\n[[File:Eastern State Penitentiary, Philadelphia, PA barber shop.jpg|thumb|right|250px|The remains of the barber shop.]]\n\nThe prison was one of the largest public-works projects of the early republic, and was a tourist destination in the 19th century.  Notable visitors included [[Charles Dickens]] and [[Alexis de Tocqueville]] while notable inmates included [[Willie Sutton]] and [[Al Capone]] in 1929. Visitors spoke with prisoners in their cells, proving that inmates were not isolated, though the prisoners themselves were not allowed to have any visits with family or friends during their stay.\n\nMost of the early prisoners were petty criminals incarcerated for various robbery and theft charges (muggers, pickpockets, purse-snatchers, burglars, etc.) and the first-time offenders often served two years.\n\nThe Penitentiary was intended not simply to punish, but to move the criminal toward spiritual reflection and change. While some have argued that the Pennsylvania system was [[Religious Society of Friends|Quaker]]-inspired, there is little evidence to support this; the organization that promoted Eastern State's creation, the Society for Alleviating the Miseries of Public Prisons (today's [[Pennsylvania Prison Society]]) was less than half Quaker, and was led for nearly fifty years by Philadelphia's Anglican bishop, [[William White (Bishop of Pennsylvania)|William White]]. Proponents of the system believed strongly that the criminals, exposed, in silence, to thoughts of their behavior and the ugliness of their crimes, would become genuinely penitent.\n\nIn reality, the guards and councilors of the facility designed a variety of physical and psychological torture regimens for various infractions, including dousing prisoners in freezing water outside during winter months, chaining their tongues to their wrists in a fashion such that struggling against the chains could cause the tongue to tear, strapping prisoners into chairs with tight leather restraints for days on end, and putting the worst behaved prisoners into a pit called \"The Hole\", an underground cellblock dug under cellblock 14 where they would have no light, no human contact, and little food for as long as two weeks.\n\n===Prison reform and rehabilitation===\n[[SCI Graterford]] opened in the 1920s after disturbances occurred at Eastern State; the Pennsylvania prison board opened Graterford to assume functions previously held by Eastern State.<ref>\"[https://web.archive.org/web/20180324042618/https://www.cor.pa.gov/Facilities/StatePrisons/Pages/Graterford.aspx SCI Graterford].\" [[Pennsylvania Department of Corrections]].

Retrieved on September 27, 2018.</ref>\n\nPrior to its closing in late 1969, Eastern State Penitentiary (then known as '''State Correctional Institution, Philadelphia''') had established a far reaching program of group therapy with the goal of having all inmates involved. From 1967, when the plan was initiated, the program appears to have been moderately successful as many inmates were involved in the groups which were voluntary. An interesting aspect was that the groups were led by two therapists, one from the psych or social work staff, and the second from the prison officer staff.<ref>Prison Manifesto. {{ISBN|0-9769715-0-X}}.

Eastern State Penitentiary: Crucible of Good Intentions. Philadelphia: Philadelphia Museum of Art, 1994.</ref> Its architectural significance first arose in 1821, when British architect [[John Haviland]] was chosen to design the building. Haviland found most of his inspiration for his plan for the penitentiary from prisons and asylums built beginning in the 1780s in England and Ireland.<ref name=\"penitentiary1994\"/> He gave the prison a neo-Gothic look to instill fear into those who thought of committing a crime.<ref name=\"DolanESP\">{{cite book | title=Eastern State Penitentiary | publisher=Arcadia Publications | author=Dolan, Francis X. | year=2007 | location=Charleston, SC}}</ref>\n\nThese complexes consist of cell wings radiating in a semi or full circle array from a center tower whence the prison could be kept under constant surveillance. The design for the penitentiary which Haviland devised became known as the hub-and-spoke plan which consisted of an octagonal center connected by corridors to seven radiating single-story cell blocks, each containing two ranges of large single cells\u20148 x 12 feet x 10 feet high- with hot water heating, a water tap, toilet, and individual exercise yards the same width as the cell.<ref name=\"penitentiary1994\"/>\n\nThere were rectangular openings in the cell wall through which food and work materials could be passed to the prisoner, as well as peepholes for guards to observe prisoners without being seen. To minimize the opportunities for communication between inmates Haviland designed a basic flush toilet for each cell with individual pipes leading to a central sewer which he hoped would prevent the sending of messages between adjacent cells.<ref name=\"penitentiary1994\"/>\n\nDespite his efforts, prisoners were still able to communicate with each other and the flushing system had to be redesigned several times. Haviland remarked that he chose the design to promote \"watching, convenience, economy, and ventilation\".<ref>Norman Johnson, Crucible of Good Intentions:35</ref> Once construction of the prison was completed in 1836, it could house 450 prisoners.<ref>Johnston, Norman. The Human Cage: A Brief History of Prison Architecture. New York: Walker and Company, 1973.</ref>\n\nHaviland completed the architecture of the Eastern state penitentiary in 1836. Each cell was lit only by a single lighting source from either skylights or windows, which was considered the \"Window of God\" or \"Eye of God\". The church viewed imprisonment, usually in isolation, as an instrument that would modify sinful or disruptive behavior. The time spent in prison would help inmates reflect on their crimes committed, giving them the mission for redemption.\n\n==Modern-day historic site==\n\nThe Eastern State Penitentiary operates as a museum and historic site, open year-round. Guided tours are offered during the winter, and during the warmer months, self-guided recorded tours with headphones are also available (narrated mainly by [[Steve Buscemi]], with former guards, wardens and prisoners also contributing). A scavenger hunt is available for children.\n\nVisitors are allowed to walk into several specially marked solitary confinement cells, but most of them remain off limits and filled with original rubble and debris from years of neglect. The city skyline of Philadelphia is visible from the prison courtyard, which still has the original baseball backstop and a chain link fence atop the \"outfield wall,\" the outer prison wall, to attempt to keep home run balls inside the grounds. There is also a camera located in the center guard tower, that lets visitors experience a correctional officer view of the prison.\n\nIn addition, Eastern State holds many special events throughout the year. Each July, there is a [[Bastille Day]] celebration, complete with a comedic reinterpretation of the storming of the Bastille and the tossing of thousands of [[Tastykake]]s from the towers,<ref>{{cite news|author=Dobrzynsky, Judith H.|title=For a Summer Getaway, A Model Prison|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=July 11, 2007|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F00E0D91039F932A25754C0A961958260&sec=travel&spon=&pagewanted=2M|accessdate=May 4, 2016}}</ref> accompanied by a cry of \"let them eat Tastykake!\" from an actor portraying Marie Antoinette.\n\nThe museum attracts close to 220,000 visitors each year.<ref name=\"Lussenhop\">{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-36163247|title=Inside decaying US prison, former inmates are guides|last=Lussenhop|first=Jessica|date=May 11, 2016|work=[[BBC Online]]|accessdate=May 11, 2016}}</ref>\n\nReligious murals in the prison chaplain's office, painted in 1955 by inmate Lester Smith, remain visible to guests despite damage from exposure to sunlight.<ref name=\"Lussenhop\" />\n\nThe tour ends with an exhibit titled \"Prisons Today: Questions in the Age of Mass Incarceration\" which informs guests about the US prison system today and its failings.<ref name=\"Lussenhop\" />\n\n===Restoration===\nThe facility was kept in \"[[arrested decay|preserved ruin]]\", meaning no significant renovation or restoration was attempted, until 1991, when [[The Pew Charitable Trusts]] provided funding so that stabilization and preservation efforts could begin.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.easternstate.org/learn/timeline |title=Timeline &#124; Eastern State Penitentiary |website=Easternstate.org |date=August 20, 1929 |accessdate=May 4, 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160425031932/http://www.easternstate.org/learn/timeline |archivedate=April 25, 2016 }}</ref>\n\n====Fundraising and projects====\n* '''Perimeter Lighting''': In 2001, the Perimeter Lighting project, funded by the Department of Community and Economic Development ($250,000), and the 2000 Halloween Fundraiser ($50,000) were completed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.easternstate.org/support/completed-projects/perimeter-lighting |title=Perimeter Lighting &#124; Eastern State Penitentiary |website=Easternstate.org |accessdate=May 4, 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160418124429/http://www.easternstate.org/support/completed-projects/perimeter-lighting |archivedate=April 18, 2016 }}</ref>\n* '''Rotunda and Links Roofing''': In 2002, the Rotunda and Links Roofing project, funded by [[National Trust for Historic Preservation|Save America's Treasures Award]] ($500,000), now defunded, the City of Philadelphia ($355,000), the Keystone Historic Preservation ($90,000), and the 2002 Halloween Fundraiser ($55,000) was completed.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.easternstate.org/support/completed-projects/rotunda-and-links-roofing |title=Rotunda and Links Roofing &#124; Eastern State Penitentiary |website=Easternstate.org |accessdate=May 4, 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160418124241/http://www.easternstate.org/support/completed-projects/rotunda-and-links-roofing |archivedate=April 18, 2016 }}</ref>\n* '''Industrial Building Stabilization''': In 2003, the Industrial Building Stabilization project, funded by the Eastern State Penitentiary Board of Directors, Senator Vincent J.

When restoration began, the cats were captured and neutered, thus causing them eventually to die off. Artist Linda Brenner sculpted 39 cat sculptures, which surround the property. The sculptures were purposefully made of a material that slowly dissolves over time to represent the inevitable natural decay that faces all living things.\n* '''The End of the Tunnel''' \u2013 Hundreds of feet of red piping were installed by artist Dayton Castleman representing paths of escape routes used by prisoners.\n* '''Recollection Tableaux''' \u2013 Six [[diorama]]s were sculpted by artist Susan Hagen to represent important moments in the prison's history. They are scattered around cell block seven.\n* '''GTMO''' \u2013 A replica of a [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp]] cell was set up by artist William Cromar inside one of the cells.\n* '''Midway of Another Day''' \u2013 A metal [[sundial]] set up to show \"the passing of time\" by Michael Grothusen in the courtyard of cell block one.\n* '''I always wanted to go to [[Paris, France]]''' \u2013 Artist Alexa Hoyer set up three TVs, one in a cell, one in a hallway, and one in a shower room, showing seven decades of prison films. The title ''I always wanted to go to Paris, France'' is from a quotation from one of the film excerpts screened in the prisoner's cell.\n* '''Juxtaposition''' \u2013 Brothers Matthew and Jonathan Stemler divided cell #34 in cell block 11 horizontally. A grid at the ceiling supports a display of suspended plaster pieces along a single plane. Ground [[mica]] [[schist]] poured onto the floor softens the step and enhances the texture of the space, while a bench provides a vantage point in which to view and consider the overall effect of the piece.\n* '''My Glass House''' \u2013 An ongoing project set up by artist Judith Taylor by taking black and white pictures of natural [[habitat]] found in the prison's walls. The prints are then turned into glass, and replace the missing glass in the [[greenhouse]] in the courtyard of cell block one.\n* [[File:RYE 3600.jpg|thumb|Pictures of people killed by people incarcerated here]]'''Living Space''' \u2013 Created by Johanna Inman and Anna Norton, Living Space consists of five videos containing time-lapse photographs of the ways Eastern State Penitentiary is altered by the changes of weather and light. The artists put their cameras in places that make Eastern State Penitentiary unique to capture the subtle ways nature plays upon the structure of the building. The goal was to create photographs which are contemplative. By allowing the public to see the gradual effects of time upon specific places, growth and decay are recognized and explored as components that make Eastern State Penitentiary a more living space.\n[[File:Eastern State Penitentiary Purge Incomplete.jpg|thumb|right|Purge Incomplete, Mary Jo Bole's exhibit]]\n* '''Purge Incomplete''' \u2013 [[Mary Jo Bole]]'s exhibit explores the history of plumbing at the penitentiary. The building had running water before the White House did. Consisting of sculptural pieces made of resin, brass, and frosted glass, Bole's designs are modeled after John Haviland's original design for the plumbing at Eastern State Penitentiary. The exhibit includes views of the plumbing from the vantage point of those residing or working at the prison, including that of the prisoners, prison guards, and the manufacturers of the plumbing. Additionally, the exhibit showcases the sculptures as having both opaque and translucent factors, in which the translucent parts glow within the cells.\n\n==Cultural references==\n[[File:Gargoyle 2, Exterior of Eastern State Penitentiary, 2006.JPG|thumb|right | Fake gargoyle on the exterior of the Eastern State Penitentiary for the [[Halloween]]-themed \"Terror Behind the Walls\" haunted attraction]]\nDue to its ominous appearance, gloomy atmosphere, and long history, Eastern State has been used as a location for television programs and films about [[haunting]]s. [[Paranormal TV]] shows like ''[[Ghost Hunters (TV series)|Ghost Hunters]]'', ''[[Ghost Adventures]]'', [[BuzzFeed Unsolved]]<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XHXLbp7x3MM</ref> and ''[[MTV's Fear]]'' explored the [[paranormal]] at Eastern State. Eastern State was also used in an episode of ''[[Cold Case (TV series)|Cold Case]]'' titled \"The House\" which dealt with a murder after an inmate escape. For the show, the prison was renamed Northern State Penitentiary.\n\nOn June 1, 2007, ''[[Most Haunted Live!]]'' conducted and broadcast a paranormal investigation live (for the first time in the United States) from Eastern State Penitentiary for seven continuous hours hoping to come in contact with supernatural beings. Punk group the [[Dead Milkmen]] also filmed the music video for their song \"Punk Rock Girl\" in Eastern State. In the [[PlayStation 2]] game, ''[[The Suffering (game)|The Suffering]]'', players can find a video documentary of Eastern State Penitentary, one of the inspirations for the game.\n\nEastern State has also served as a location in several feature films. [[Terry Gilliam]]'s 1995 film ''[[12 Monkeys (film)|Twelve Monkeys]]'' used it as the setting for a mental hospital. The 1998 film [[Return to Paradise (1998 film)|''Return to Paradise'']] used it as a substitute for a prison in Malaysia.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0124595/locations?ref_=tt_dt_dt |website=IMDB |accessdate=July 12, 2018|title=Return to Paradise (1998) }}</ref>  The 2000 film ''[[Animal Factory]]'', directed by [[Steve Buscemi]] relied heavily on Eastern State in its portrayal of a prison in a state of advancing decay. In June 2008, [[Paramount Pictures]] used parts of Eastern State Penitentiary for the filming of ''[[Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen]]''.\n\nIn September 2008, the History Press released ''Eastern State Penitentiary: A History'', the only comprehensive history book currently in print about Eastern State. It was written by Paul Kahan, a historian and former tour guide, with the assistance of the site's education director; the book has a foreword written by the penitentiary's former social worker.\n\nIn 2012, the soundtrack to the film ''[[Alpha Girls]]'' was recorded in Eastern State Penitentiary by the band [[Southwork]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2178927/trivia|title=Alpha Girls (2013)|work=IMDb|accessdate=April 30, 2016}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of National Historic Landmarks in Philadelphia]]\n* [[National Register of Historic Places listings in North Philadelphia]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Portal|Philadelphia|Pennsylvania}}\n{{Commons category}}\n* Manion, Jen.
