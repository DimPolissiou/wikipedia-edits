He has lived and worked in Co Clare, Dublin, and apart from periods working in the USA, he has largely been based in [[Co Sligo]] since 1992.  In 2018 after 34 years he became an Irish Citizen.

He began to gain critical recognition in the early 2000s exhibiting work that tackled the traditionally conservative tradition of Irish [[Landscape painting]] through his particular approach of ''encounter painting'' to portray land and nature in the rural West of Ireland.<ref>[http://www.irishtimes.com/news/wild-views-from-a-truck-1.932463] - The Irish Times, article by [[Aidan Dunne]]</ref><ref>[http://www.nickmiller.ie/figure_to_ground/] - ''Figure to Ground'' at the RHA Gallery, Dublin (2003)</ref> The Mobile Studio enabled a highly productive 15 year period work<ref>[http://www.nickmiller.ie/truckscapes/] - ''[http://www.nickmiller.ie/truckscapes/ Truckscapes]'' Exhibited at the RHA Gallery, Dublin (2003), Limerick City Gallery (2007), Centre Culturel Irlandais, Paris (2008), and New York Studio School (2008)</ref> that explored Landscape through the interface of the artist with both culture and nature.

Miller took up residency in the Museum, spending time with McGuire's work studio contents and personal belongings. During the residency he made a series of  still life paintings of objects and the many stuffed birds that Mcguire was renowned for painting. McGuire had died not long after Miller settled in Dublin, in 1986. As a way to connect to the man, he had not met, but whose work Miller admired, he invited a number of McGuires sitters to come and sit for him in IMMA and talk about Edward, often over 30 years later. These included Theresa Browne, [[Garech Browne]], Wanda Ryan, and the poets [[Anthony Cronin]] and [[Paul Durcan]].

He has lived and worked in Co Clare, Dublin, and apart from periods working in the USA, he has largely been based in [[Co Sligo]] since 1992.  In 2018 after 34 years he became an Irish Citizen. He has become one of Ireland's leading contemporary painters. In recognition of his significant contribution to [[Irish Art]], he was elected to [[Aosd\u00e1na]] in 2001.\n\n== Exhibitions ==\nSignificant solo museum exhibitions of his work have taken place at the [[Irish Museum of Modern Art]] (''South African Works ''in 1994, and'' Nick Miller and the Studio of Edward McGuire''<ref>[https://imma.ie/whats-on/imma-collection-nick-miller-and-the-studio-of-edward-mcguire/] - Irish Museum of Modern Art - ''Nick Miller and the Studio of Edward McGuire'' | Nov 2015 - May 2016.</ref> in 2015-16) and, The [[Royal Hibernian Academy]], Dublin in 2003''(Figure To Ground)''; The [[Butler Gallery]] , Kilkenny Castle in 2004''(Genre)''; [[Limerick City Gallery of Art]] and [[Centre Culturel Irlandais]], Paris in 2007''(Truckscapes:Drawings)''. In 2008 he exhibited ''Truckscapes: Paintings'' at the gallery of the historic [[New York Studio School]].\n\n== Career ==\nIn 1997 he converted a Truck, a mobile British Telecom workshop, into a mobile studio, facilitating the artist to work on large scale paintings and drawings in the landscape, but protected from the elements. He began to gain critical recognition in the early 2000's exhibiting work that tackled the traditionally conservative tradition of Irish [[Landscape painting]] through his particular approach of ''encounter painting'' to portray land and nature in the rural West of Ireland.<ref>[http://www.irishtimes.com/news/wild-views-from-a-truck-1.932463] - The Irish Times, article by [[Aidan Dunne]]</ref><ref>[http://www.nickmiller.ie/figure_to_ground/] - ''Figure to Ground'' at the RHA Gallery, Dublin (2003)</ref> The Mobile Studio enabled a highly productive 15 year period work<ref>[http://www.nickmiller.ie/truckscapes/] - ''[http://www.nickmiller.ie/truckscapes/ Truckscapes]'' Exhibited at the RHA Gallery, Dublin (2003), Limerick City Gallery (2007), Centre Culturel Irlandais, Paris (2008), and New York Studio School (2008)</ref> that explored Landscape through the interface of the artist with both culture and nature.

Miller took up residency in the Museum, spending time with McGuire's work studio contents and personal belongings. During the residency he made a series of  still life paintings of objects and the many stuffed birds that Mcguire was renowned for painting. McGuire had died not long after Miller settled in Dublin, in 1986. As a way to connect to the man, he had not met, but whose work Miller admired, he invited a number of McGuires sitters to come and sit for him in IMMA and talk about Edward, often over 30 years later. These included Theresa Browne, [[Garech Browne]], Wanda Ryan, and the poets [[Anthony Cronin]] and [[Paul Durcan]]. The resulting exhibition at the museum: ''Nick Miller and the Studio of Edward McGuire'' (November 2016 -May 2016)<ref>[http://www.nickmiller.ie/edward-mcguire_studio/] - [http://www.nickmiller.ie/edward-mcguire_studio/ Official website] : - ''Nick Miller and the studio of Edward McGuire'', IMMA, Nov 2015-May 2016</ref> featured both artists' works on similar subjects, and an installation of McGuire's studio belongings with a film made by Miller about McGuire's renowned \"''Colour Dictionary''\"<ref>[https://imma.ie/whats-on/imma-collection-nick-miller-and-the-studio-of-edward-mcguire/] - IMMA Collection : ''[https://imma.ie/whats-on/imma-collection-nick-miller-and-the-studio-of-edward-mcguire/ Nick Miller and the studio of Edward McGuire]'', Irish Museum of Modern Art, Nov 2015-May 2016</ref><ref>[http://www.nickmiller.ie/resources/Reviews-PDFs/irishtimes_Miller_McGuire-web.pdf] - - ''[https://www.irishtimes.com/culture/art-and-design/visual-art/an-artistic-inheritance-that-pays-off-visual-art-round-up-1.2454646 An unusual artistic inheritance pays off]'', Aidan Dunne, The Irish Times, 3/12/15</ref>\n\nIn the same way that Miller attempts to reinvigorate traditions around landscape and portraiture, he continues to evolve the genre of the 'still life', often merging still life with portraiture.<ref>[https://imma.ie/collection/noreen-with-polaroid/] - ''Noreen with Polaroid'' is a 1994 work by Nick Miller, part of the IMMA Permanent Collection.</ref> In more recent years, since 2011 he began to return to painting elements of nature, flowers, weeds, branches and even seaweed, placed in a variety of vases.

Rarely, an [[enterolith]] may form.

Plain X-rays are insufficient to diagnose diverticular disease.\n* Contrast CT is the investigation of choice in acute episodes of diverticulitis and where complications exist.\n* [[Colonoscopy]] will show the diverticulum and rule out malignancy. A colonoscopy should be performed 4\u20136 weeks after an acute episode.\n* [[Lower gastrointestinal series|Barium enema]] is inferior to colonoscopy in terms of image quality and is usually only performed if the patient has strictures or an excessively tortuous sigmoid colon where colonoscopy is difficult or dangerous.\n* MRI provides a clear picture of the soft tissue of the abdomen, however its expense often outweighs the benefits when compared to contrast CT or colonoscopy.\n* There is no blood test for diverticulosis.\n\nIt is important to note that both barium enema and colonoscopy are contraindicated during acute episodes of diverticulitis, as the barium may leak out into the abdominal cavity, and colonoscopy can cause perforations of the bowel wall.\n\n==Management==\n\nMany people with diverticulosis have minimal to no symptoms, and do not require any specific treatment. Colonic stimulants should be avoided. Treatments, like some colon cleansers, that cause hard stools, constipation, and straining, are not recommended.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\n===Diet===\nA high-fiber diet and fiber supplements are advisable to prevent constipation.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Aldoori | first1 = WH | last2 = Giovannucci | first2 = EL | last3 = Rimm | first3 = EB | last4 = Wing | first4 = AL | last5 = Trichopoulos | first5 = DV | last6 = Willett | first6 = WC |displayauthors= 4 | title = A prospective study of diet and the risk of symptomatic diverticular disease in men | url = http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/60/5/757.abstract | journal = The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition | volume = 60 | issue = 5 | pages = 757\u201364 | year = 1994 | pmid = 7942584 | doi = 10.1093/ajcn/60.5.757 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Gear | first1 = JS | last2 = Ware | first2 = A | last3 = Fursdon | first3 = P | last4 = Mann | first4 = JI | last5 = Nolan | first5 = DJ | last6 = Brodribb | first6 = AJ | last7 = Vessey | first7 = MP |displayauthors= 4 | title = Symptomless diverticular disease and intake of dietary fibre | journal = Lancet | volume = 1 | issue = 8115 | pages = 511\u20134 | year = 1979 | pmid = 85104 | doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(79)90942-5}}</ref> The American Dietetic Association recommends 20\u201335&nbsp;grams each day.

They argued that the colonic muscles needed to contract strongly in order to transmit and expel the small stool associated with a fiber deficient diet.

He was convicted twice for a total of five murders.\n\n== Youth ==\nWillem van Eijk was born in 1941 in the small village of [[Korteraar]], [[South Holland]], then under the [[Reichskommissariat Niederlande|German occupation of the Netherlands]]. During his time at an elementary school in [[Ter Aar]], he was an outcast and referred to as \"{{lang|nl|Gekke Willempje}}\" ([[Dutch language|Dutch]] for \"crazy little Willem\"), something he later used to justify his actions. During this time of extreme bullying, Willem started to collect morbid items, such as dead bugs and frogs. He soon gained notoriety in his home village for his cruelty towards animals; especially dogs, cats, and ducks. Still a loner when attending high school, Van Eijk committed petty crimes. During this time he started to dream about raping and killing women.\n\n== Victims ==\n* '''Cora Mantel''' - In 1971 he picked up the 15-year-old Cora Mantel from [[Uithoorn]]. Having missed her bus ride home after meeting with her boyfriend in [[Amsterdam]], Van Eijk found her hitchhiking. He raped and strangled her with her own shawl, before dumping her body in a ditch near Uithoorn. Her body was found on 22 June 1971. Because on the morning of the murder she was to start her new job at a jewelry store in [[Aalsmeer]], the jeweler was, for a short period of time, a suspect.\n* '''Aaltje van der Plaat''' - On 19 August 1974 the lifeless body of 43-year-old Aaltje van der Plaat was found near a road inside a cornfield. She had suffered multiple stab wounds, her belly was ripped open, and her left nipple was cut off. Willem van Eijk lived in a houseboat named {{lang|nl|De Vrijheid}} (The Freedom) at the end of the road. Several witnesses had seen Van Eijk ride his [[moped]] on the evening the body was found, near the area where the body was found. The police arrested Van Eijk, and he immediately confessed to the murders of Cora and Aaltje.\n\nIn 1975, Van Eijk was sentenced to 18 years imprisonment and [[Involuntary commitment|TBS]]. The details of the murders, as revealed during the trial, were so astonishing to the public that several judiciary guards vomited. Psychiatric reports explained that Van Eijk had severe childhood trauma as a result of bullying and rejection by women. During his therapy at the [[FPC Dr. S. van Mesdag|Van Mesdagkliniek]], psychiatrists speculated that his deviant behavior was the result of brain damage sustained during his birth. In 1980, while still in remand, he married his penfriend Adri. In 1990 he was released and together they moved into a house in [[Harkstede]]. Psychiatrists believed that his relationship with Adri would prevent him from reoffending, but warned that subsequent female rejections could trigger a relapse. The relationship turned out to be a downward spiral for Van Eijk.\n\n* '''Antoanella Bertholda (Michelle) Fatol''' - In November 1993 in a ditch near the village [[Enumatil]] the corpse of a 23-year-old prostitute was found. It turned out to be Michelle Fatol. During sex Van Eijk strangled her with his bare hands.\n* '''Annelies Reinders''' - On 21 January 1995 the body of the 31-year-old prostitute Annelies Reinder was found in the [[Eemskanaal]] near [[Appingedam]].\n\nBetween his release and his second arrest there were eight prostitutes, and several other young women murdered in and around the area of Van Eijk's residence. In 1997, Van Eijk was a suspect for the murder of Anne de Ruyter de Wildt, and in 2000 for the [[murder of Marianne Vaatstra]]; however, DNA tests proved his innocence in these cases. Several years later both murderers of these two women were caught.\n\n* '''Sasja Schenker''' -  On 17 July 2001 the lifeless, naked body of the 34-year-old prostitute Sasja Schenker was found in the [[Slochterdiep]] near Harkstede. Her clothes were found several months later near Van Eijk's house. They were found to have been thrown into the canal in a plastic bag weighted with stones.\n\nBecause Schenker's clothes were found near Van Eijk's house, he became a prime suspect and on 12 November 2001, police arrested Van Eijk. He soon confessed to the murders of Michelle Fatol, Annelies Reinders, and Sasja Schenker. Police also suspected him of the murders of Shirley Hereijgers, Antoinette Bont, and Jolanda Meijer; however, Van Eijk did not confess to those, and there was no concrete evidence for his involvement. The ground around his house was excavated; however, there were no bodies found. As of 2013, Jolanda Meijer is still missing.\n\n=== Possible victims ===\nBetween 1993 and 2001, several other bodies were found. In 1995, the torso of 24-year-old prostitute Antoinette Bont was found in the [[Winschoterdiep]]. Other body parts were later found in a sports bag. Two years later, in 1997, the body of 19-year-old prostitute Shirley Hereijgers was found. Around the same time, Jolanda Meijer (35), Hereijger's friend and colleague also disappeared. Several other men were suspected of these killings, but all turned out to be innocent. Willem van Eijk never confessed to killing these women, however, it is publicly believed he is responsible {{Citation needed|date=June 2014}}.\n\n== Trial and sentence ==\nAt the start of the trial, Van Eijk was represented by lawyer Willem Anker, much to the astonishment of the relatives of Shirley Hereijgers, as Willem Anker also represented them. When Van Eijk was officially declared a suspect in murdering Shirley, Willem Anker dropped his client. After going through a series of other lawyers, Van Eijk was sentenced, on 7 November 2002, to life imprisonment for the murder of the last three victims. Van Eijk appealed, but the [[Supreme Court of the Netherlands]] upheld the ruling. Van Eijk several times requested clemency, which in the Netherlands can only be given by the head of state, and all of the requests were denied.\n\n==Death==\nIn July 2019 it was revealed van Eijk had died in prison on 19 June 2019.<ref>[https://www.rtlnieuws.nl/nieuws/nederland/artikel/4767576/seriemoordenaar-willem-van-eijk-beest-van-harkstede-overleden Seriemoordenaar Willem van Eijk ('Beest van Harkstede') overleden in gevangenis] - RTL Nieuws {{in lang|nl}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n* {{cite book |last=van der Zee|first=Sytze |authorlink= |title=Anatomie van een seriemoordenaar: een portret|url= |accessdate= |year=2006|publisher=De Bezige Bij|location=Amsterdam|isbn=90-234-1894-8|page= |pages=}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Eijk, Willem van}}\n[[Category:1941 births]]\n[[Category:2019 deaths]]\n[[Category:People from Nieuwkoop]]\n[[Category:Dutch serial killers]]\n[[Category:Male serial killers]]\n[[Category:Dutch rapists]]\n[[Category:Prisoners sentenced to life imprisonment by the Netherlands]]\n[[Category:Dutch prisoners sentenced to life imprisonment]]\n[[Category:Dutch people convicted of murder]]\n[[Category:People convicted of murder by the Netherlands]]\n[[Category:20th-century Dutch criminals]]\n[[Category:21st-century Dutch criminals]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox serial killer\n| name        = Willem van Eijk\n| image       = \n| caption     = \n| birthname   = Willem van Eijk\n| birth_date  = 13 August 1941\n| birth_place = [[Korteraar]] ([[Nieuwkoop]])\n| death_date  = {{death date and age |2019|6|19|1941|08|13|df=yes}}\n| death_place = [[Vught]], Netherlands\n| victims     = 5\n| country     = [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]]\n| beginyear   = 1971\n| endyear     = 2001\n| apprehended = 12 November 2001\n| sentence    = [[Life imprisonment]]\n}}\n\n'''Willem van Eijk''' (13 August 1941 \u2013 19 June 2019) was a convicted [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[serial killer]] known as '''\"Het Beest van Harkstede\"''' (The Beast of [[Harkstede]]).

In 1997, Van Eijk was a suspect for the murder of Anne de Ruyter de Wildt, and in 2000 for the [[murder of Marianne Vaatstra]]; however, DNA tests proved his innocence in these cases. Several years later both murderers of these two women were caught.\n\n* '''Sasja Schenker''' -  On 17 July 2001 the lifeless, naked body of the 34-year-old prostitute Sasja Schenker was found in the [[Slochterdiep]] near Harkstede. Her clothes were found several months later near Van Eijk's house. They were found to have been thrown into the canal in a plastic bag weighted with stones.\n\nBecause Schenker's clothes were found near Van Eijk's house, he became a prime suspect and on 12 November 2001, police arrested Van Eijk. He soon confessed to the murders of Michelle Fatol, Annelies Reinders, and Sasja Schenker. Police also suspected him of the murders of Shirley Hereijgers, Antoinnette Bont, and Jolanda Meijer; however, Van Eijk did not confess to those, and there was no concrete evidence for his involvement. The ground around his house was excavated; however, there were no bodies found. As of 2013, Jolanda Meijer is still missing.\n\n=== Possible victims ===\nBetween 1993 and 2001, several other bodies were found. In 1995, the torso of 24-year-old prostitute Antoinette Bont was found in the [[Winschoterdiep]]. Other body parts were later found in a sports bag. Two years later, in 1997, the body of 19-year-old prostitute Shirley Hereijgers was found. Around the same time, Jolanda Meijer (35), Hereijger's friend and colleague also disappeared. Several other men were suspected of these killings, but all turned out to be innocent. Willem van Eijk never confessed to killing these women, however, it is publicly believed he is responsible {{Citation needed|date=June 2014}}.\n\n== Trial and sentence ==\nAt the start of the trial, Van Eijk was represented by lawyer Willem Anker, much to the astonishment of the relatives of Shirley Hereijgers, as Willem Anker also represented them. When Van Eijk was officially declared a suspect in murdering Shirley, Willem Anker dropped his client. After going through a series of other lawyers, Van Eijk was sentenced, on 7 November 2002, to life imprisonment for the murder of the last three victims. Van Eijk appealed, but the [[Supreme Court of the Netherlands]] upheld the ruling. Van Eijk several times requested clemency, which in the Netherlands can only be given by the head of state, and all of the requests were denied.\n\n==Death==\nIn July 2019 it was revealed van Eijk had died in prison on 19 June 2019.<ref>[https://www.rtlnieuws.nl/nieuws/nederland/artikel/4767576/seriemoordenaar-willem-van-eijk-beest-van-harkstede-overleden Seriemoordenaar Willem van Eijk ('Beest van Harkstede') overleden in gevangenis] - RTL Nieuws {{in lang|nl}}</ref>\n\n== References ==\n* {{cite book |last=van der Zee|first=Sytze |authorlink= |title=Anatomie van een seriemoordenaar: een portret|url= |accessdate= |year=2006|publisher=De Bezige Bij|location=Amsterdam|isbn=90-234-1894-8|page= |pages=}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Eijk, Willem van}}\n[[Category:1941 births]]\n[[Category:2019 deaths]]\n[[Category:People from Nieuwkoop]]\n[[Category:Dutch serial killers]]\n[[Category:Male serial killers]]\n[[Category:Dutch rapists]]\n[[Category:Prisoners sentenced to life imprisonment by the Netherlands]]\n[[Category:Dutch prisoners sentenced to life imprisonment]]\n[[Category:Dutch people convicted of murder]]\n[[Category:People convicted of murder by the Netherlands]]\n[[Category:20th-century Dutch criminals]]\n[[Category:21st-century Dutch criminals]]\n", "name_user": "Bellowhead678", "label": "safe", "comment": "Antoinnette->Antoinette -Fix a typo in one click", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Willem_van_Eijk"}
