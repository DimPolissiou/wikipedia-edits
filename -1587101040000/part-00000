French troops had tried to quell nationalist protests in Syria at the continued occupation of the [[Levant]] by France. With heavy Syrian casualties, [[Winston Churchill]] opposed French action and sent British forces into Syria from [[Jordan]] with orders to fire on the French if necessary.<ref name=\"Luce\">{{cite book|last1=Luce|first1=Henry Robinson|title=Time, Volume 45|date=1945|publisher=Time Incorporated|pages=25\u201326|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=U-ELAQAAIAAJ&q=}}</ref>\n\nBritish armoured cars and troops then reached the Syrian capital [[Damascus]] following which the French were escorted and confined to their barracks.<ref name=\"Wall\">Wall p. 33</ref> With political pressure added the French ordered a ceasefire.<ref name=\"Bell\">Bell p.76</ref> The crisis almost brought Britain and France to the point of war.<ref>Dilks p. 150</ref><ref name=\"Fenby\">Fenby pp 42\u201347</ref>\n\n==Background==\n[[File:French Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon map en.svg|thumb|250px|Map of French Mandates \u2013 Syria and Lebanon]]\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, [[Ottoman Syria|Syria]] and [[Lebanon]] were two Arab states occupied a region known as the Levant and were part of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. After the [[Sinai and Palestine Campaign|Ottoman defeat]] there in [[World War I]] and as a result of the [[Treaty of Sevres]], they were then ruled under a [[French Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon|French mandate]] given by the [[League of Nations]] at the [[Paris Peace Conference (1919)|Paris Peace Conference]] in 1919.\n\nIn 1936 Syria [[Franco-Syrian Treaty of Independence|signed a treaty]] with France which provided Syrian independence. However, with the breakout of World War II this never happened as the French feared that [[Nazi Germany]] would capitalise if France relinquished its colonies in the Middle East. Riots thus broke out and the new President [[Hashim al-Atassi]] resigned. With the [[Battle of France|fall of France]] in 1940, Syria came under the control of [[Vichy France]] until the British and [[Free France|Free French]] occupied the country in the [[Syria\u2013Lebanon campaign]] in July 1941.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Mickelsen|first1=Martin L|title=Another Fashoda: the Anglo-Free French Conflict over the Levant, May-September, 1941|journal=Revue fran\u00e7aise d'histoire d'outre-mer|date=1976|volume=63|issue=230|pages=75\u2013100|url=http://www.persee.fr/doc/outre_0300-9513_1976_num_63_230_1895}}</ref> Syria proclaimed its independence again in 1941, but it was not until 1 January 1944 that it was recognised as an independent republic.

News of this provoked more nationalist protests in Damascus. On [[VE Day]] both countries saw huge protests in which some French nationals were attacked and killed. The French responded to these protests with threats of artillery and air strikes in an effort to stop the movement towards independence. Talks ceased immediately, and skirmishes took place between the Arabs and the French and [[Senegalese]] forces while Syrian and Lebanese soldiers deserted their French officers.<ref name=\"Lentz\">Lentz p. 730</ref>\n\n==Crisis==\nThe crisis began proper on May 19 when demonstrations in Damascus involved firing on the grounds of the French hospital; about a dozen people were injured but none were killed. The next day serious rioting broke out in [[Aleppo]] in which a number of French soldiers were killed and some injured. In retaliation General Oliva-Roget ordered his troops to open fire on demonstrators in Damascus.

Paget had a large force in the region at his disposal and threatened that he would be forced to intervene from the [[Emirate of Transjordan|Transjordan]] if the violence did not stop. Churchill agreed but needed the backing of the United States and the [[Soviet Union]] in which to send British troops against the French.<ref name=\"Thomas\"/>\n\nAt the same time the French [[Army of the Levant]] in the region had been severely weakened - nearly 70 percent of all officers and 40 percent of Syrian soldiers in the French army had deserted their posts and taken up arms with the Syrian rebels. In Hama two French aircraft were downed, while the commander of a French unit was ambushed and killed. In [[Hauran]] French troops were rounded up  disarmed - their weapons distributed to young men hoping to march towards Damascus to help the central government.{{sfn|Moubayed|2012|p=63}} The French then called in for reinforcements and were now using their air force to drop bombs on suspected areas of resistance. At the same time the Syrian Prime Minister [[Faris al-Khoury]] was at the founding conference of the [[United Nations]] in [[San Francisco]], presenting Syria's claim for independence and also ordered the fighting to stop. They were both backed by President [[Harry Truman]], who declared \"those French ought to be taken out and castrated\".<ref>Jonathan Fenby: ''The General.

This was ignored and Churchill the next day without waiting for a response from the Americans authorised Paget to invade.<ref name=\"Wall\"/>\n\nOn 1 June Paget ordered his force to invade Syria from Transjordan, with troops and tanks of the [[31st Indian Armoured Division]].<ref name=\"Brecher&Wilkenfeld\">Brecher & Wilkenfeld, pp. 420-21</ref> They struck towards Damascus with 'D' Squadron of the [[1st King's Dragoon Guards|Kings Dragoon Guards]] having rolled into [[Beirut]] from which they cut the communications of Oliva-Roget. Paget ordered Oliva-Roget to tell his men to cease fire, but the Frenchman said that he would not take orders from the British even though Paget was his superior officer and Commander of [[Middle East Command]]. Paget then advanced towards Damascus; eventually and having realised he was heavily outnumbered, Roget ordered his men back to their base near the coast. He was angry that the British had arrived only after he had \"restored order\". He told a Syrian journalist, ''You are replacing the easygoing French with the brutal British''.<ref name=\"Gaunson\">Gaunson pp. 178-79</ref> That night, with the Syrians killing any French or Senegalese troops they could find, the French were forced to accept the British escort back to the safety of their barracks at gunpoint.<ref name=\"Lentz\"/>\n[[File:Lieutenant-general B C T Paget Cb, Dso, Mc Art.IWMARTLD1253.jpg|180px|thumb|Sir Bernard Paget Commander of [[Middle East Command]]]]\n\nThe British then had to mop up any of the French that had still not returned to their barracks much to the cheers of the people of Damascus.<ref name=\"Luce\"/> The damage to the city was considerable - the Syrian parliament was a smouldering shell, a large area of the town had been destroyed by fire and the streets were pitted with shell holes.<ref name=\"Barr\"/>\n\nThe [[Manchester Guardian]] reported the event with patriotic delight:\n{{quotation|I marched into Damascus with the sailors\u2026while crowds of surprised Damascenes clapped their hands\u2026The people of Damascus hissed and booed the long line of British lorries, tanks and [[Bren gun carrier]]s taking French troops out of the city, escorted by British armoured cars.<ref name=\"Buruma\">Buruma p. 245</ref>}}\n\nOn 2 June De Gaulle realized nothing could be done and reluctantly arranged a ceasefire - Oliva-Roget was later sacked, but a furious row broke out between Britain and France.<ref name=\"Barr\"/>\n\n===Ceasefire & diplomacy===\nOnce Paget had taken control of Damascus he then imposed a curfew on all French citizens.

After the [[Sinai and Palestine Campaign|Ottoman defeat]] there in [[World War I]] and as a result of the [[Treaty of Sevres]], they were then ruled under a [[French Mandate for Syria and the Lebanon|French mandate]] given by the [[League of Nations]] at the [[Paris Peace Conference (1919)|Paris Peace Conference]] in 1919.\n\nIn 1936 Syria [[Franco-Syrian Treaty of Independence|signed a treaty]] with France which provided Syrian independence. However, with the breakout of World War II this never happened as the French feared that [[Nazi Germany]] would capitalise if France relinquished its colonies in the Middle East. Riots thus broke out and the new President [[Hashim al-Atassi]] resigned. With the [[Battle of France|fall of France]] in 1940, Syria came under the control of [[Vichy France]] until the British and [[Free France|Free French]] occupied the country in the [[Syria-Lebanon campaign]] in July 1941.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Mickelsen|first1=Martin L|title=Another Fashoda: the Anglo-Free French Conflict over the Levant, May-September, 1941|journal=Revue fran\u00e7aise d'histoire d'outre-mer|date=1976|volume=63|issue=230|pages=75\u2013100|url=http://www.persee.fr/doc/outre_0300-9513_1976_num_63_230_1895}}</ref> Syria proclaimed its independence again in 1941, but it was not until 1 January 1944 that it was recognised as an independent republic. For several months after both Lebanon and Syria had seen demonstrations against the French. With more and more French reinforcements having arrived, the demonstrations soon escalated.<ref name=\"PurnellHistory\">Masson, Philippe (1966) ''[[Purnell's History of the Second World War]]'': No. 119. \"France's Retreat from Empire\"</ref>\n\n[[Charles De Gaulle]] as head of the French [[Provisional Government of the French Republic|Provisional Government]] sent General Paul Beynet to establish an air base in Syria and a naval base in Lebanon in April 1945. News of this provoked more nationalist protests in Damascus. On [[VE Day]] both countries saw huge protests in which some French nationals were attacked and killed. The French responded to these protests with threats of artillery and air strikes in an effort to stop the movement towards independence. Talks ceased immediately, and skirmishes took place between the Arabs and the French and [[Senegalese]] forces while Syrian and Lebanese soldiers deserted their French officers.<ref name=\"Lentz\">Lentz p. 730</ref>\n\n==Crisis==\nThe crisis began proper on May 19 when demonstrations in Damascus involved firing on the grounds of the French hospital; about a dozen people were injured but none were killed. The next day serious rioting broke out in [[Aleppo]] in which a number of French soldiers were killed and some injured. In retaliation General Oliva-Roget ordered his troops to open fire on demonstrators in Damascus. Within several days the fighting escalated between Syrian youths and the French army in [[Hama]] and [[Homs]].<ref name=\"Thomas\">Thomas pp. 123-124</ref>\n[[File:Churchill De Gaulle HU 60057.jpg|thumb|220px|Winston Churchill and Charles De Gaulle in a meeting in 1944]]\n\nOn May 29 French troops stormed the [[Syrian parliament]] and tried to arrest the President [[Shukri al-Quwatli]] and the speaker [[Saadallah al-Jabiri]] but both managed to escape. The French burned, bombarded the building and then cut off Damascus's electricity. They also sealed off Syria's borders with Jordan, [[Iraq]] and the Lebanon. The French began shelling with artillery and mortars while colonial Senegalese troops were sent in, who committed acts of looting and wanton destruction.<ref name=\"Rogan\">Rogan pp. 244\u2013246</ref>\n\nQuwatli having managed to escape via a British armoured car sent an urgent request for intervention to Prime Minister Winston Churchill for British troops to intervene.{{sfn|Moubayed|2012|p=64}} Churchill said he would do what he could, but his relationship with Charles de Gaulle however was at this time at a low ebb following the visit to [[Paris]] the previous year in spite of his efforts to preserve French interests following the [[Yalta conference]].<ref name=\"Werth\">{{cite book|last1=Werth|first1=Alexander|title=De Gaulle: A Political Biography|date=1966|publisher=Simon and Schuster|page=[https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780671194147/page/186 186]|url=https://archive.org/details/isbn_9780671194147|url-access=registration}}</ref> In January Churchill told a colleague that he believed that de Gaulle was \"a great danger to peace and for Great Britain.

I am sure that in the long run no understanding will be reached with General de Gaulle\".<ref name=Fenby />\n\nGeneral [[Bernard Paget]], who was in charge of the British [[Ninth Army (United Kingdom)|Ninth Army]] reminded the French they fell under his command.<ref name=\"Barr\">Barr pp. 209-12</ref> De Gaulle had thought this ended with the war over in Europe but would actually terminate once the [[Pacific war]] had ended. Paget had a large force in the region at his disposal and threatened that he would be forced to intervene from the [[Emirate of Transjordan|Transjordan]] if the violence did not stop. Churchill agreed but needed the backing of the United States and the [[Soviet Union]] in which to send British troops against the French.<ref name=\"Thomas\"/>\n\nAt the same time the French [[Army of the Levant]] in the region had been severely weakened - nearly 70 percent of all officers and 40 percent of Syrian soldiers in the French army had deserted their posts and taken up arms with the Syrian rebels. In Hama two French aircraft were downed, while the commander of a French unit was ambushed and killed. In [[Hauran]] French troops were rounded up  disarmed - their weapons distributed to young men hoping to march towards Damascus to help the central government.{{sfn|Moubayed|2012|p=63}} The French then called in for reinforcements and were now using their air force to drop bombs on suspected areas of resistance. At the same time the Syrian Prime Minister [[Faris al-Khoury]] was at the founding conference of the [[United Nations]] in [[San Francisco]], presenting Syria's claim for independence and also ordered the fighting to stop. They were both backed by President [[Harry Truman]], who declared \"those French ought to be taken out and castrated\".<ref>Jonathan Fenby: ''The General. Charles de Gaulle and the France he Saved'', Skyhorse, New York 2012, p. 288.</ref>\n\n===British intervention===\nFinally, on 31 May, with news that the casualty toll had exceeded a thousand Syrians, Churchill sent de Gaulle a message saying, \"In order to avoid a collision between British and French forces, we request you immediately order French troops to cease fire and withdraw to their barracks\". This was ignored and Churchill the next day without waiting for a response from the Americans authorised Paget to invade.<ref name=\"Wall\"/>\n\nOn 1 June Paget ordered his force to invade Syria from Transjordan, with troops and tanks of the [[31st Indian Armoured Division]].<ref name=\"Brecher&Wilkenfeld\">Brecher & Wilkenfeld, pp. 420-21</ref> They struck towards Damascus with 'D' Squadron of the [[1st King's Dragoon Guards|Kings Dragoon Guards]] having rolled into [[Beirut]] from which they cut the communications of Oliva-Roget. Paget ordered Oliva-Roget to tell his men to cease fire, but the Frenchman said that he would not take orders from the British even though Paget was his superior officer and Commander of [[Middle East Command]]. Paget then advanced towards Damascus; eventually and having realised he was heavily outnumbered, Roget ordered his men back to their base near the coast. He was angry that the British had arrived only after he had \"restored order\". He told a Syrian journalist, ''You are replacing the easygoing French with the brutal British''.<ref name=\"Gaunson\">Gaunson pp. 178-79</ref> That night, with the Syrians killing any French or Senegalese troops they could find, the French were forced to accept the British escort back to the safety of their barracks at gunpoint.<ref name=\"Lentz\"/>\n[[File:Lieutenant-general B C T Paget Cb, Dso, Mc Art.IWMARTLD1253.jpg|180px|thumb|Sir Bernard Paget Commander of [[Middle East Command]]]]\n\nThe British then had to mop up any of the French that had still not returned to their barracks much to the cheers of the people of Damascus.<ref name=\"Luce\"/> The damage to the city was considerable - the Syrian parliament was a smouldering shell, a large area of the town had been destroyed by fire and the streets were pitted with shell holes.<ref name=\"Barr\"/>\n\nThe [[Manchester Guardian]] reported the event with patriotic delight:\n{{quotation|I marched into Damascus with the sailors\u2026while crowds of surprised Damascenes clapped their hands\u2026The people of Damascus hissed and booed the long line of British lorries, tanks and [[Bren gun carrier]]s taking French troops out of the city, escorted by British armoured cars.<ref name=\"Buruma\">Buruma p. 245</ref>}}\n\nOn 2 June De Gaulle realized nothing could be done and reluctantly arranged a ceasefire - Oliva-Roget was later sacked, but a furious row broke out between Britain and France.<ref name=\"Barr\"/>\n\n===Ceasefire & diplomacy===\nOnce Paget had taken control of Damascus he then imposed a curfew on all French citizens. French soldiers were kept in their barracks and were not allowed to shoot except in self-defence under the watchful eyes of British guns.

On 10 July ''Mannforce'', together with the 2nd [[Sherwood Foresters]], were called to [[Baniyas]] when the French opened fire on the town with mortars and machine guns. With control restored there Lieutenant Mann then took a party to the Turkish frontier to bring back the horses and French officers of their Cavalry unit, whose men had deserted. By this time order was restored in the majority of Syria.<ref name=\"kdg\"/>\n\nBeynet was furious and labelled the British measures as a ''stab in the back''. De Gaulle raged against 'Churchill's ultimatum' saying that; ''the whole thing stank of oil''.<ref name=Werth /> The [[List of ambassadors of the United Kingdom to France|British ambassador to France]] [[Duff Cooper]] was summoned by the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Development (France)|French foreign minister]] [[Georges Bidault]] saying ''whatever mistakes France had made she did not deserve such humiliation as this''.

For example: John said: \"I saw Mary today\". Quotations in oral speech are also signaled by special [[prosody (linguistics)|prosody]] in addition to quotative markers. In written text, quotations are signaled by quotation marks.<ref name=\"sdq bonami\">{{cite web |last1=Bonami |first1=Olivier |last2=Godard |first2=Dani\u00e8le |title=On the Syntax of Direct Quotation in French | date=2008 | url=https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-00751080/document |website=HAL |accessdate=10 April 2020}}</ref> Quotations are also used to present well-known statement parts that are explicitly attributed by [[citation]] to their original source; such statements are marked with ([[punctuation|punctuated]] with) [[quotation mark]]s.\n\nQuotations are often used as a literary device to represent someone's point of view. They are also widely used in spoken language when an interlocutor wishes to present a proposition that they have come to know via hearsay.\n\n\n==Quotations as a literary device==\nA quotation can also refer to the repeated use of units of any other form of expression, especially parts of artistic works: elements of a [[painting]], scenes from a [[film|movie]] or sections from a [[musical composition]].\n\n===Reasons for using quotations as a literary device===\nQuotations are used for a variety of reasons: to illuminate the meaning or to support the arguments of the work in which it is being quoted, to provide direct information about the work being quoted (whether in order to discuss it, positively or negatively), to pay homage to the original work or [[author]], to make the user of the quotation seem well-read, and/or to comply with copyright law.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.elc.edu/english-grammar-lesson-using-quotes/|title=English Grammar Lesson - Using Quotes! - ELC|date=2016-11-16|work=ELC - English Language Center|access-date=2017-10-24|language=en-US}}</ref> Quotations are also commonly printed as a means of inspiration and to invoke philosophical thoughts from the reader. Pragmatically speaking, quotations can also be used as language games (in the Wittgensteinian sense of the term) to manipulate social order and the structure of society.<ref>Capone, A., & Salmani Nodoushan, M. A. (2014). On indirect reports and language games: Evidence from Persian. Rivista Italiana di Filosofia del Linguaggio, 8(2), 26-42.</ref><ref>Salmani Nodoushan, M. A. (2015). The secret life of slurs from the perspective of reported speech. Rivista Italiana di Filosofia del Linguaggio, 9(2), 92-112.</ref>\n\n===Common quotation sources===\nFamous quotations are frequently collected in books that are sometimes called quotation dictionaries or treasuries.  Of these, ''[[Bartlett's Familiar Quotations]]'', ''[[The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations]]'', ''The [[Columbia University Press|Columbia]] Dictionary of Quotations'', ''[[The Yale Book of Quotations]]'' and ''The [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]] Book of Proverbs, Maxims, and Famous Phrases'' are considered among the most reliable and comprehensive sources.  Diaries and calendars often include quotations for entertainment or inspirational purposes, and small, dedicated sections in newspapers and weekly magazines\u2014with recent quotations by leading personalities on current topics\u2014have also become commonplace.\n\n===Misquotations===\n{{further|False attribution}}\n{{See also|List of movie misquotes}}\nMany quotations are routinely incorrect or attributed to the wrong authors, and quotations from obscure or unknown writers are often attributed to far more famous writers. Examples of this are [[Winston Churchill]], to whom many political quotations of uncertain origin are attributed, and [[Oscar Wilde]], to whom anonymous humorous quotations are sometimes attributed.<ref>See ''A Book of Misquotations'', edited by Elizabeth Knowles, Oxford University Press, 2006.</ref>\n\nThe ''Star Trek'' catchphrase \"[[Beam me up, Scotty]]\" did not appear in that form in the original series.

Instead, they convey the approximative meaning of such an utterance along with the way in which that utterance was produced. From a [[sociolinguistics|sociolinguistic]] perspective, a quotation in spoken discourse can therefore also be defined as \u201ca performance whereby speakers re-enact previous behaviour (speech/thought/sound/voice effect and gesture) while assuming the dramatic role of the original source of this reported behaviour\u201d.<ref name=\"buch\">{{cite book |last1=Buchstaller |first1=Isabelle |title=Quotatives: New Trends and Sociolinguistic Implications |date=2014 |publisher=Wiley Blackwell |isbn=9780470657188 |edition=1st}}</ref>\n\nTraditionally, quotations\u2014more specifically known as direct quotations<ref name=\"clark\" />\u2014have been distinguished from indirect quotations. Direct quotations differ from indirect quotations in that they are reported from the perspective of the experiencer, while indirect quotations are reported from the perspective of the reporting speaker (e.g. ''\"He said: 'I am leaving now'\u201d'' versus ''\"He said (that) he was leaving immediately\"''); are free in their syntactic form, while indirect quotations are subject to language-specific structural requirements (e.g. indirect quotations in many [[Indo-European languages]] are required to have the syntactic form of a [[Well-formedness|well-formed]] declarative [[dependent clause|subordinate clause]]); incorporate extralinguistic material and pragmatic markers, while indirect quotations do not. Crucially, direct quotations have a performative aspect (i.e. occur simultaneously with re-enactments of previous behaviours), which indirect quotations lack.<ref name=\"buch\" /><ref name=\"clark\">{{cite journal |last1=Clark |first1=Herbert |last2=Gerrig |first2=Richard |title=Quotations as Demonstrations |journal=Language |date=December 1990 |volume=66 |issue=4 |pages=764\u2013805 |doi=10.2307/414729 |jstor=414729 |url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Quotations-as-Demonstrations.-Clark-Gerrig/54571a1199be1954678338a879189359fab44182 |accessdate=14 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Reasons for using quotations in spoken discourse===\n\nQuotations are employed in spoken discourse for many reasons. They are often used by speakers to depict stories and events that have occurred in the past to other [[Interlocutor (linguistics)|interlocutors]]. The speaker does not necessarily have to have been an original participant in the story or event. Therefore, they can quote something that they did not hear firsthand. Quotations are also used to express thoughts that have never been uttered aloud prior to being quoted. For example, while telling a story, a speaker quotes inner thoughts that they had during a specific situation. Finally, speakers use quotations to propose future dialogue for participants in a situation that may take place in the future. For example, two friends talk about their 10-year high school reunion that will take place in the future and propose what they would say. While future dialogue can be proposed for a situation that will likely happen, it can also be based on a situation that will not actually take place. In the latter usage, the proposed dialogue only exists in the conversational context.<ref name=\"jessie\">{{cite journal |last1=Sams |first1=Jessie |title=Quoting the unspoken: An analysis of quotations in spoken discourse |journal=Journal of Pragmatics |date=November 2010 |volume=42 |issue=11 |pages=3147\u20133160 |doi=10.1016/j.pragma.2010.04.024 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378216610001220 |accessdate=11 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe quoted material is usually not a verbatim replication of an utterance that someone originally said. Instead, quotations in spoken discourse reproduce what a speaker wishes to communicate to their recipients; quotations demonstrate something that someone said, the manner in which that person said it, and the current speaker\u2019s feelings about what was said.<ref name=\"jessie\" /><ref name=\"clark\" /> In this way, quotations are an especially effective storytelling device; the speaker is able to give a voice to the protagonists in their stories themselves, which allows the speaker\u2019s audience to experience the situation in the way that the speaker themselves experienced it.<ref name=\"buch\" />\n\n===Form of quotation===\n\nIn most languages, quotations in spoken discourse are introduced by a verb of saying and a pronoun. For example, a quotation in English can be introduced by ''\u201cShe said\u201d''. In some languages, there is a discourse marker in addition to the verb of saying that functions as verbal quotation marks.<ref name=\"tracy\">{{cite book |authorlink1=Quotatives |editor1-last=Tracy |editor1-first=Karen |title=The international encyclopedia of language and social interaction |date=2015 |publisher=Wiley Blackwell |isbn=9781118611463 |pages=1272-1276}}</ref> For example, Japanese uses the quotative particle (a type of quotative marker) ''to'' along with the conjugated verb of saying ''itta'':\n\nGloss: TOP=Topic Marker DAT=Dative NOM=Nominative COM=complementizer\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| \u3086\u304d || \u306f || \u3042\u306a\u305f\u3000|| \u306b\u306f || \u5f7c\u5973 || \u304c || \u597d\u304d || \u3068 || \u8a00\u3063\u305f \u3002<ref name=\"tracy\"/>\n|-\n| Yuki || wa || anata|| ni wa || kanocho || ga || suki || '''to''' || '''itta''' .\n|-\n| Yuki|| TOP || you || DAT || her || NOM || like || COM || said\n|-\n| colspan=9|\"''Yuki said that you liked her.''\"\n|}\n\nVerbs of saying (also known as quotative verbs) and quotative particles, along with quotative evidentials, are different types of quotative markers, which signal quotations in utterances.<ref name=\"tracy\"/>\n\n====Quotative markers====\nQuotative markers are used to mark a section of an utterance as quoted speech (i.e. a quotation). In oral speech, quotative markers act as quotation marks and often include a verb of saying (e.g. ''say''). A quotative marker appears either before or after the reported speech or thought, depending on the syntax of the language.<ref name=\"tracy\"/> For example, compare English and Japanese:\n\n'''English:'''\n\nIn English, the quotative verb ''say'' occurs before the quotation:<ref name=\"tracy\"/>\n  She '''said''' \u201cWill you answer the phone, will you answer the phone\u201d<ref name=\"frederica\"> Frederica Barbieri. ''Quotative Use in American English'', Journal of English Linguistics, Vol. 33/No.3, September 2005.</ref>\n\nIn English, verbs such as ''be like'', ''go'', and ''be all'' are non-standard quotatives that are commonly used in colloquial speech.<ref name=\"tracy\"/> They are observed in the speech of young people not only in American English, but in English spoken in places like Glasgow, Scotland as well.<ref name=\"adfoolen\">{{cite book |authorlink1=New quotative markers in spoken discourse |editor1-last=Ahrenholz |editor1-first=Bernt |editor2-last=Bredel |editor2-first=Ursula |editor3-last=Klein |editor3-first=Wolfgang |editor4-last=Rost-Roth |editor4-first=Martina |editor5-last=Skiba |editor5-first=Romuald |title=Empirische Forschung und Theoriebildung |date=2008 |publisher=Peter Lang |location=Frankfurt am Main |isbn=978-3-631-56930-6 |pages=117-128}}</ref><ref name=\"frederica\"/> Though not semantically considered a verb of saying, they are used as verbs of saying.

Like ''to'' and ''iu'' (say),  ''to'' and ''omou'' occur after the quotation.\n\n\nIn addition to quotative markers, speakers also use prosodic shifts, pauses, pronominal choices, and tense to detect the occurrence and boundaries of quotations in spoken utterances.<ref name=\"tracy\"/>\n\n==== Spanish ====\n===== Quotative Verb =====\n\n===Syntax of quotation===\nDifferent versions of quotative verbs, particles, and evidentials can be used to express the same idea with varying nuances, often to frame how the primary speaker, or the person who is quoting, feels about a quotation. The syntax of quotations varies cross-linguistically. A primary speaker may use the tense and linguistic idiosyncrasies of the speech at the time it was uttered in a quotation, independent from the tense in the main clause in some languages, or use the same tense in both the main clause and quotation in other languages. They will also use [[coreference|coreferenced]] pronouns to the direct quotation's first-person subject in the main clause: She<sub>x</sub> said, \"I<sub>x</sub>...\"; they<sub>y</sub> said \"we<sub>y</sub> ...\" In many languages, the primary speaker may also attempt to quote an utterance in the same language the original speaker used, even if an interlocutor does not understand it; however, it is mainly context-dependent such as when telling stories.  <ref name=\"Evans Canonical\">{{cite book |last1=Evans |first1=Nicholas |title=Canonical Morphology and Syntax |date=2012 |publisher=Oxford University Press |chapter=Some problems in the typology of quotation: a canonical approach}}</ref><ref name=\"Klamer report\">{{cite journal |last1=Klamer |first1=Marian |title=How report verbs become quote markers and complementisers |journal=Lingua |date=2000 |volume=110 |issue=2 |pages=69\u201398 |doi=10.1016/S0024-3841(99)00032-7|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0024384199000327 | accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"DarcyA Review>{{cite journal |last1=D'Arcy |first1=Alexandra |title=Quotation and advances in understanding syntactic systems |journal=Annual Review of Linguistics |volume=1 |issue=1 |page=43-61 |doi=10.1146/annurev-linguist-030514-125220}}</ref>\n\n=====Quotative verbs=====\nQuotative verbs are lexical verbs that indicate the speech, thoughts, or perceptions of the original speaker.<ref name=\"Evans Canonical\"/><ref name=\"Klamer report\"/>\n\nQuotations can be introduced as the complement to a quotative verb or as the head phrase to an adjunct phrase containing a quotative verb in some languages like English and French.<ref name=\"sdq bonami\"/><ref name=\"DarcyA Review/>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! ||Quotation as complement || Quotation as head phrase adjunct <ref name=\"sdq bonami\"/>\n|-\n| English || Marie said, \u201cMy brother has arrived.\u201d || \u201cMy brother has arrived,\" as Marie said.\n|-\n| French || Marie a dit, \u201cMon fr\u00e8re est arriv\u00e9.\u201d || \u201cMon fr\u00e8re est arriv\u00e9,\" comme a dit Marie.\n|}\nEnglish also displays [[verb-second]] (V2) order vestige only in quotation contexts (quotative inversion), requiring the finite verb to appear in the second position of a clause. For example: \"No no no\" ''says'' Harry. <ref name=\"DarcyA Review/>\n\nDirect and indirect quotations are sometimes not distinguishable. Traditionally, English uses an overt complementizer ''that'' after a quotative verb to indicate indirect quotation, but it is also seen to prompt direct quotation in some English varieties like Indian English, Hong Kong English, and Kenyan English.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Hong Kong English || After the movie I just ''said that'' \"Oh Frank I cannot walk.\" <ref name=\"DarcyA Review\"/>\n|-\n| Indian English || Never a husband ''says that'' \"I'll make a cup of tea okay, you sit. I'll make a cup of tea.\"\n|-\n| Kenyan English || So Kabuwe Abuwe ''told'' us ''that'' \"If it is for wedding I am not going to contribute.\"\n|}\n\n=====Quotative particles=====\nQuotative or hearsay particles are grammatical markers equivalent to full lexical verbs with meanings of ''\"say, mention, tell, etc.\"'' In many languages, they are [[grammaticalization|grammaticalized]] to different extremes from their previously lexical form. Common patterns of grammaticalization trajectories include verb to complementizer in many African and Asian languages and verb to [[tense-aspect-mood]] markers primarily in African languages, but also in Australian languages and multiple other [[language family|language families]]. <ref name=\"DarcyA Review/><ref name=\"Matsui and Yamamoto\">{{cite journal |last1=Matsui |first1=Tomoko |last2=Yamamoto |first2=Taeko |title=Developing sensitivity to the sources of information: Early use of the Japanese quotative particles tte and to in mother\u2013child conversation |journal=Journal of Pragmatics |date=2013 |volume=59 |issue= |pages=5\u201325 |doi=10.1016/j.pragma.2013.06.008 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378216613001598|accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nJapanese, for example, uses a sentence-final quotative particle ''tte'' verbally to mean \"I heard (quote)\" with some uncertainty. In sentence-medial position, ''tte'' is sometimes regarded along with ''to'' to be either a quotative particle or complementizer meaning \"I heard (quote)\" with less uncertainty and often more knowledge of the origin of the quote.\n\nGloss: QP=Quotative Particle FP=Final Particle\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| \u660e\u65e5 || \u6674\u308c\u308b || -\u3063\u3066\u3000<ref name=\"Matsui and Yamamoto\" />\n|-\n| Ashita || hareru || ''tte''.\n|-\n| tomorrow || will-be-fine || QP\n|-\n| colspan=7|\"''It will be fine tomorrow, I heard.''\"\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| \u660e\u65e5 || \u6674\u308c\u308b || -\u3063\u3066/\u3068 || \u8a00\u3063\u3066\u305f\u3000||\u3000\u3088\u3000<ref name=\"Matsui and Yamamoto\" />\n|-\n| Ashita || hareru || ''tte''/''to'' || itteta || yo.\n|-\n| tomorrow || will-be-fine || QP || said || FP\n|-\n| colspan=7|\"''(X) said that it would be fine tomorrow.''\"\n|}\n\nVerbs of saying are highly restricted in Australian languages and almost always immediately proceed the complement verb. \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Diaries and calendars often include quotations for entertainment or inspirational purposes, and small, dedicated sections in newspapers and weekly magazines\u2014with recent quotations by leading personalities on current topics\u2014have also become commonplace.\n\n===Misquotations===\n{{further|False attribution}}\n{{See also|List of movie misquotes}}\nMany quotations are routinely incorrect or attributed to the wrong authors, and quotations from obscure or unknown writers are often attributed to far more famous writers. Examples of this are [[Winston Churchill]], to whom many political quotations of uncertain origin are attributed, and [[Oscar Wilde]], to whom anonymous humorous quotations are sometimes attributed.<ref>See ''A Book of Misquotations'', edited by Elizabeth Knowles, Oxford University Press, 2006.</ref>\n\nThe ''Star Trek'' catchphrase \"[[Beam me up, Scotty]]\" did not appear in that form in the original series. Other misquotations include \"[[Just the facts, ma'am]]\" (attributed to [[Jack Webb]]'s character of [[Joe Friday]] on ''[[Dragnet (series)|Dragnet]]''), \"Heavy lies the crown\" from Shakespeare's Play [[Henry IV, Part 2]], \"[[Sherlock Holmes#\"Elementary, my dear Watson\"|Elementary, my dear Watson]]\" (attributed to [[Sherlock Holmes]]; it was, however, said in the films ''[[The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes]]'' and ''[[The Return of Sherlock Holmes (1929 film)|The Return of Sherlock Holmes]]''), \"[[Luke, I am your father]]\" (attributed to [[Darth Vader]] in [[Star Wars]]), \"[[Casablanca (film)#Quotations|Play it again, Sam]]\" (attributed to Ilsa in ''[[Casablanca (film)#Quotations|Casablanca]]''), \"[[Do you feel lucky, punk?]]\" (attributed to [[Dirty Harry (character)|Harry Callahan]] in ''[[Dirty Harry]]'') and \"[[Stinking badges|We don't need no stinkin' badges!]]\" (attributed to Gold Hat in ''[[The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (film)|The Treasure of the Sierra Madre]]'').<ref>The Holmes phrase originated in a radio play.

Instead, they convey the approximative meaning of such an utterance along with the way in which that utterance was produced. From a [[sociolinguistics|sociolinguistic]] perspective, a quotation in spoken discourse can therefore also be defined as \u201ca performance whereby speakers re-enact previous behaviour (speech/thought/sound/voice effect and gesture) while assuming the dramatic role of the original source of this reported behaviour\u201d.<ref name=\"buch\">{{cite book |last1=Buchstaller |first1=Isabelle |title=Quotatives: New Trends and Sociolinguistic Implications |date=2014 |publisher=Wiley Blackwell |isbn=9780470657188 |edition=1st}}</ref>\n\nTraditionally, quotations\u2014more specifically known as direct quotations<ref name=\"clark\" />\u2014have been distinguished from indirect quotations. Direct quotations differ from indirect quotations in that they are reported from the perspective of the experiencer, while indirect quotations are reported from the perspective of the reporting speaker (e.g. ''\"He said: 'I am leaving now'\u201d'' versus ''\"He said (that) he was leaving immediately\"''); are free in their syntactic form, while indirect quotations are subject to language-specific structural requirements (e.g. indirect quotations in many [[Indo-European languages]] are required to have the syntactic form of a [[Well-formedness|well-formed]] declarative [[dependent clause|subordinate clause]]); incorporate extralinguistic material and pragmatic markers, while indirect quotations do not. Crucially, direct quotations have a performative aspect (i.e. occur simultaneously with re-enactments of previous behaviours), which indirect quotations lack.<ref name=\"buch\" /><ref name=\"clark\">{{cite journal |last1=Clark |first1=Herbert |last2=Gerrig |first2=Richard |title=Quotations as Demonstrations |journal=Language |date=December 1990 |volume=66 |issue=4 |pages=764\u2013805 |doi=10.2307/414729 |jstor=414729 |url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Quotations-as-Demonstrations.-Clark-Gerrig/54571a1199be1954678338a879189359fab44182 |accessdate=14 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Reasons for using quotations in spoken discourse===\n\nQuotations are employed in spoken discourse for many reasons. They are often used by speakers to depict stories and events that have occurred in the past to other [[Interlocutor (linguistics)|interlocutors]]. The speaker does not necessarily have to have been an original participant in the story or event. Therefore, they can quote something that they did not hear firsthand. Quotations are also used to express thoughts that have never been uttered aloud prior to being quoted. For example, while telling a story, a speaker quotes inner thoughts that they had during a specific situation. Finally, speakers use quotations to propose future dialogue for participants in a situation that may take place in the future. For example, two friends talk about their 10-year high school reunion that will take place in the future and propose what they would say. While future dialogue can be proposed for a situation that will likely happen, it can also be based on a situation that will not actually take place. In the latter usage, the proposed dialogue only exists in the conversational context.<ref name=\"jessie\">{{cite journal |last1=Sams |first1=Jessie |title=Quoting the unspoken: An analysis of quotations in spoken discourse |journal=Journal of Pragmatics |date=November 2010 |volume=42 |issue=11 |pages=3147\u20133160 |doi=10.1016/j.pragma.2010.04.024 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378216610001220 |accessdate=11 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe quoted material is usually not a verbatim replication of an utterance that someone originally said. Instead, quotations in spoken discourse reproduce what a speaker wishes to communicate to their recipients; quotations demonstrate something that someone said, the manner in which that person said it, and the current speaker\u2019s feelings about what was said.<ref name=\"jessie\" /><ref name=\"clark\" /> In this way, quotations are an especially effective storytelling device; the speaker is able to give a voice to the protagonists in their stories themselves, which allows the speaker\u2019s audience to experience the situation in the way that the speaker themselves experienced it.<ref name=\"buch\" />\n\n===Form of quotation===\n\nIn most languages, quotations in spoken discourse are introduced by a verb of saying and a pronoun. For example, a quotation in English can be introduced by ''\u201cShe said\u201d''. In some languages, there is a discourse marker in addition to the verb of saying that functions as verbal quotation marks.<ref name=\"tracy\">{{cite book |authorlink1=Quotatives |editor1-last=Tracy |editor1-first=Karen |title=The international encyclopedia of language and social interaction |date=2015 |publisher=Wiley Blackwell |isbn=9781118611463 |pages=1272-1276}}</ref> For example, Japanese uses the quotative particle (a type of quotative marker) ''to'' along with the conjugated verb of saying ''itta'':\n\nGloss: TOP=Topic Marker DAT=Dative NOM=Nominative COM=complementizer\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| \u3086\u304d || \u306f || \u3042\u306a\u305f\u3000|| \u306b\u306f || \u5f7c\u5973 || \u304c || \u597d\u304d || \u3068 || \u8a00\u3063\u305f \u3002<ref name=\"tracy\"/>\n|-\n| Yuki || wa || anata|| ni wa || kanocho || ga || suki || '''to''' || '''itta''' .\n|-\n| Yuki|| TOP || you || DAT || her || NOM || like || COM || said\n|-\n| colspan=9|\"''Yuki said that you liked her.''\"\n|}\n\nVerbs of saying (also known as quotative verbs) and quotative particles, along with quotative evidentials, are different types of quotative markers, which signal quotations in utterances.<ref name=\"tracy\"/>\n\n====Quotative markers====\nQuotative markers are used to mark a section of an utterance as quoted speech (i.e. a quotation). In oral speech, quotative markers act as quotation marks and often include a verb of saying (e.g. ''say''). A quotative marker appears either before or after the reported speech or thought, depending on the syntax of the language.<ref name=\"tracy\"/> For example, compare English and Japanese:\n\n'''English:'''\n\nIn English, the quotative verb ''say'' occurs before the quotation:<ref name=\"tracy\"/><ref name=\"frederica\"> Frederica Barbieri. ''Quotative Use in American English'', Journal of English Linguistics, Vol. 33/No.3, September 2005.</ref>\n  She '''said''' \u201cWill you answer the phone, will you answer the phone\u201d\n\nIn English, verbs such as ''be like'', ''go'', and ''be all'' are non-standard quotatives that are commonly used in colloquial speech.<ref name=\"tracy\"/> They are observed in the speech of young people not only in American English, but in English spoken in places like Glasgow, Scotland as well.<ref name=\"adfoolen\">{{cite book |authorlink1=New quotative markers in spoken discourse |editor1-last=Ahrenholz |editor1-first=Bernt |editor2-last=Bredel |editor2-first=Ursula |editor3-last=Klein |editor3-first=Wolfgang |editor4-last=Rost-Roth |editor4-first=Martina |editor5-last=Skiba |editor5-first=Romuald |title=Empirische Forschung und Theoriebildung |date=2008 |publisher=Peter Lang |location=Frankfurt am Main |isbn=978-3-631-56930-6 |pages=117-128}}</ref><ref name=\"frederica\"/> Though not semantically considered a verb of saying, they are used as verbs of saying.

Like ''to'' and ''iu'' (say),  ''to'' and ''omou'' occur after the quotation.\n\n\nIn addition to quotative markers, speakers also use prosodic shifts, pauses, pronominal choices, and tense to detect the occurrence and boundaries of quotations in spoken utterances.<ref name=\"tracy\"/>\n\n==== Spanish ====\n===== Quotative Verb =====\n\n===Syntax of quotation===\nDifferent versions of quotative verbs, particles, and evidentials can be used to express the same idea with varying nuances, often to frame how the primary speaker, or the person who is quoting, feels about a quotation. The syntax of quotations varies cross-linguistically. A primary speaker may use the tense and linguistic idiosyncrasies of the speech at the time it was uttered in a quotation, independent from the tense in the main clause in some languages, or use the same tense in both the main clause and quotation in other languages. They will also use [[coreference|coreferenced]] pronouns to the direct quotation's first-person subject in the main clause: She<sub>x</sub> said, \"I<sub>x</sub>...\"; they<sub>y</sub> said \"we<sub>y</sub> ...\" In many languages, the primary speaker may also attempt to quote an utterance in the same language the original speaker used, even if an interlocutor does not understand it; however, it is mainly context-dependent such as when telling stories.  <ref name=\"Evans Canonical\">{{cite book |last1=Evans |first1=Nicholas |title=Canonical Morphology and Syntax |date=2012 |publisher=Oxford University Press |chapter=Some problems in the typology of quotation: a canonical approach}}</ref><ref name=\"Klamer report\">{{cite journal |last1=Klamer |first1=Marian |title=How report verbs become quote markers and complementisers |journal=Lingua |date=2000 |volume=110 |issue=2 |pages=69\u201398 |doi=10.1016/S0024-3841(99)00032-7|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0024384199000327 | accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"DarcyA Review>{{cite journal |last1=D'Arcy |first1=Alexandra |title=Quotation and advances in understanding syntactic systems |journal=Annual Review of Linguistics |volume=1 |issue=1 |page=43-61 |doi=10.1146/annurev-linguist-030514-125220}}</ref>\n\n=====Quotative verbs=====\nQuotative verbs are lexical verbs that indicate the speech, thoughts, or perceptions of the original speaker.<ref name=\"Evans Canonical\"/><ref name=\"Klamer report\"/>\n\nQuotations can be introduced as the complement to a quotative verb or as the head phrase to an adjunct phrase containing a quotative verb in some languages like English and French.<ref name=\"sdq bonami\"/><ref name=\"DarcyA Review/>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! ||Quotation as complement || Quotation as head phrase adjunct <ref name=\"sdq bonami\"/>\n|-\n| English || Marie said, \u201cMy brother has arrived.\u201d || \u201cMy brother has arrived,\" as Marie said.\n|-\n| French || Marie a dit, \u201cMon fr\u00e8re est arriv\u00e9.\u201d || \u201cMon fr\u00e8re est arriv\u00e9,\" comme a dit Marie.\n|}\nEnglish also displays [[verb-second]] (V2) order vestige only in quotation contexts (quotative inversion), requiring the finite verb to appear in the second position of a clause. For example: \"No no no\" ''says'' Harry. <ref name=\"DarcyA Review/>\n\nDirect and indirect quotations are sometimes not distinguishable. Traditionally, English uses an overt complementizer ''that'' after a quotative verb to indicate indirect quotation, but it is also seen to prompt direct quotation in some English varieties like Indian English, Hong Kong English, and Kenyan English.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Hong Kong English || After the movie I just ''said that'' \"Oh Frank I cannot walk.\" <ref name=\"DarcyA Review\"/>\n|-\n| Indian English || Never a husband ''says that'' \"I'll make a cup of tea okay, you sit. I'll make a cup of tea.\"\n|-\n| Kenyan English || So Kabuwe Abuwe ''told'' us ''that'' \"If it is for wedding I am not going to contribute.\"\n|}\n\n=====Quotative particles=====\nQuotative or hearsay particles are grammatical markers equivalent to full lexical verbs with meanings of ''\"say, mention, tell, etc.\"'' In many languages, they are [[grammaticalization|grammaticalized]] to different extremes from their previously lexical form. Common patterns of grammaticalization trajectories include verb to complementizer in many African and Asian languages and verb to [[tense-aspect-mood]] markers primarily in African languages, but also in Australian languages and multiple other [[language family|language families]]. <ref name=\"DarcyA Review/><ref name=\"Matsui and Yamamoto\">{{cite journal |last1=Matsui |first1=Tomoko |last2=Yamamoto |first2=Taeko |title=Developing sensitivity to the sources of information: Early use of the Japanese quotative particles tte and to in mother\u2013child conversation |journal=Journal of Pragmatics |date=2013 |volume=59 |issue= |pages=5\u201325 |doi=10.1016/j.pragma.2013.06.008 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378216613001598|accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nJapanese, for example, uses a sentence-final quotative particle ''tte'' verbally to mean \"I heard (quote)\" with some uncertainty. In sentence-medial position, ''tte'' is sometimes regarded along with ''to'' to be either a quotative particle or complementizer meaning \"I heard (quote)\" with less uncertainty and often more knowledge of the origin of the quote.\n\nGloss: QP=Quotative Particle FP=Final Particle\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| \u660e\u65e5 || \u6674\u308c\u308b || -\u3063\u3066\u3000<ref name=\"Matsui and Yamamoto\" />\n|-\n| Ashita || hareru || ''tte''.\n|-\n| tomorrow || will-be-fine || QP\n|-\n| colspan=7|\"''It will be fine tomorrow, I heard.''\"\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| \u660e\u65e5 || \u6674\u308c\u308b || -\u3063\u3066/\u3068 || \u8a00\u3063\u3066\u305f\u3000||\u3000\u3088\u3000<ref name=\"Matsui and Yamamoto\" />\n|-\n| Ashita || hareru || ''tte''/''to'' || itteta || yo.\n|-\n| tomorrow || will-be-fine || QP || said || FP\n|-\n| colspan=7|\"''(X) said that it would be fine tomorrow.''\"\n|}\n\nVerbs of saying are highly restricted in Australian languages and almost always immediately proceed the complement verb. \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

To the east of the Greuthungi, living near the Don river, were the [[Alans]].\n\nWhen the [[Huns]] arrived in the European Steppe region in the 4th century, first the Alans were forced to join them, and then a large part of the Greuthungi. Alans and Goths became an important part of [[Attila]]'s forces, together with other eastern European peoples. Other Greuthungi, together with some Alans and Huns, crossed the [[Lower Danube]] to join a large group of Tervingi who had entered the [[Roman empire]] in 376. These peoples defeated an imperial army in the [[Battle of Adrianople]] in 378, and came to a settlement agreement within the Roman empire by 382. \n\nThe original tribal names of the Goths fell out of use within the empire. Many of the 382 settlers appear to have been an important component of the [[Visigoths]] who formed under [[Alaric I]]. Based upon interpretations of the ''Getica'' by the 6th century writer [[Jordanes]], although it never mentions the Greuthungi, the Greuthungi are more strongly associated with both the Gothic king [[Ermanaric]], and the later [[Amal dynasty]] who were among Attila's Goths. After the collapse of Attila's empire, the Amals founded the [[Ostrogothic]] kingdom in the Roman Balkans.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe root ''greut-'' is probably related to the [[Old English]] ''greot'', meaning \"gravel, grit, earth\", thus implying that the name refers to a geographical region where the Greuthungi lived.<ref>Sch\u00f6feld, ''W\u00f6rterbuch der altgermanischen personen- und v\u00f6lkernamen'', [https://archive.org/details/wrterbuchderaltg00schn/page/113/ p.113]</ref><ref>{{citation|first=Thomas S. |last=Burns |title=A History of the Ostrogoths |publication-place=Bloomington |publisher=Indiana University Press |year=1984 |page=30 |url=https://books.google.be/books?id=dw3FEpOUrRkC}}</ref> \n\nIt has therefore been argued, for example by [[Herwig Wolfram]], who agrees with the older position of [[Franz Altheim]], that this is supported by evidence that geographic descriptors were commonly used to distinguish people living north of the Black Sea both before and after Gothic settlement there.<ref name=\"Wolfram387n58\">{{harvtxt|Wolfram|1988|page=388 n58}}</ref>\n\nMore specifically, he argues that ''Greuthungi'' may indicate that they lived on gritty steppes or \"pebbly coasts\", and should be seen as contrasting with the Tervingi, whose name may be related to the English word \"tree\" and indicate a forest origin.<ref name=\"Wolfram25\">{{citation|first=Herwig |last=Wolfram |title=History of the Goths | translator-last =Dunlap | translator-first =Thomas J. |publication-place=Berkeley |publisher=University of California Press |year=1988 |page=25 |url=https://books.google.be/books?id=xsQxcJvaLjAC}}</ref> \n\nIt has also been proposed that the name ''Greuthungi'' has pre-Pontic Scandinavian origins.<ref name=\"Wolfram387n58\"/> Wolfram for example notes that J. Svennung for example, has proposed that it may mean \"rock people\", and refer to a rocky homeland west of the [[Geats|Gauts]] in what is today Sweden.<ref name=\"Wolfram387n58\"/> \n\nIt has also been noted by some scholars, starting with [[Karl M\u00fcllenhoff]] in the 19th century, that in a list of peoples living on the island of [[Scandza]], [[Jordanes]] listed \"Mixi, Evagre, and Otingis\" among those who \"live like wild animals in rocks hewn out like castles\".<ref name=chr>Latin and translation given at {{cite book|last=Christensen |first=Arne S\u00f8by|title=Cassiodorus, Jordanes and the History of the Goths: Studies in a Migration Myth |year=2002| location=Copenhagen|publisher=Museum Tusculanum Press |url=https://books.google.be/books?id=AcLDHOqOt4cC |ref=harv|pages=267-268}}</ref> M\u00fcllenhoff proposed that the last part referred to the Greutungi, but no consensus has arisen to explain all the terms.{{sfn|Christensen|2002|pages=296\u2013298}}\n\n==History==\n{{see|Ostrogoths#History}}\nAn unreliable later text, the ''[[Historia Augusta]]'' text for the Emperor [[Probus (emperor)|Probus]] (died 282), mentions the Greuthungi together with [[Vandals]] and [[Gepids]], who were supposedly settled in [[Thrace]] together with 100,000 [[Bastarnae]]. While the Bastarnae remained faithful, the other three peoples broke faith and were crushed by Probus.<ref>''Historia Augusta'', \"[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Historia_Augusta/Probus*.html Probus]\". See {{harvtxt|Christensen|2002|p=212}}.</ref> Still more doubtful, in the ''Historia Augusta'' article for Emperor [[Claudius Gothicus]] (reigned 268-270), the following list of \"[[Scythian]]\" peoples is given who had been conquered by the emperor when he earned his title \"Gothicus\": \"''peuci trutungi austorgoti uirtingi sigy pedes celtae etiam eruli''\". These words are traditionally edited by modern to include well-known peoples: \"''[[Peuci]], Grutungi, Austrogothi, Tervingi, Visi, Gipedes, [[Celts|Celtae]] etiam et [[Heruli|Eruli]]''\".{{sfn|Christensen|2002|pages=201\u2013205}}\n\nThe first event which can confidently be ascribed to the Greuthungi was much later, in the 369 campaign against the Goths by Emperor [[Valens]], in retribution for the support of the usurper [[Procopius (usurper)|Procopius]] (died 366). This was described by Ammianus writing in the 390s.<ref>Ammianus Marcellinus, ''Res Gestae'', [https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ammian/27*.html Book 27], 5.6.</ref> Valens crossed the Lower Danube at [[Noviodunum (castra)|Novidunum]] and went deep into Gothic territory where he came across the warlike people called the Greuthungi. Their apparent leader [[Athanaric]] who was, in this passage, described by Ammianus as their most powerful judge \"''iudicem potentissimum''\", was compelled to flee, and then make a peace agreement in the middle of the Danube, promising to never set foot on Roman soil. This same Athanaric is later described by Ammianus as a judge of the [[Tervingi]], raising questions about the nature of the distinction between the Tervingi and Greuthungi. Ammianus specifically describes the Greuthungi as Goths.{{sfn|Christensen|2002|page=212}}\n\nThe Greuthungi were next mentioned by Ammianus as defeated by the invading Huns in the early 370s.<ref>Ammianus Marcellinus, ''Res Gestae'', [https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ammian/31*.html Book 31].</ref> The Huns first plundered and recruited the Alans of the Don river (the classical Tanais) and then attacked the domain of the warlike monarch King Ermenric, who was apparently king of the Greuthungi, who eventually committed suicide. \n\n[[Jordanes]] in his history of the Goths, the ''[[Getica]]'', written about 551, does not mention the Greuthungi, but instead writes as if the [[Ostrogoths]] and [[Visigoths]] of the 5th and 6th centuries already existed in the 3rd and 4th centuries. Jordanes does on the other hand describe a single large Gothic empire until the late 4th-century, ruled by Ermanaric. In contrast, [[Ammianus Marcellinus]], himself writing in the late 4th-century, mentions Ermanaric as the Greuthungi leader, but implies that his kingdom was relatively small compared to the large empire described by Jordanes.<ref>Heather, Peter, 1998, ''The Goths,'' Blackwell, Malden, pp. 53-55.</ref><ref>Kulikowski, Michael, 2007, ''Rome's Gothic Wars'', Cambridge University Press: Cambridge, pp. 54-56, 111-112.</ref>\n\nThe defense against the Huns and Alans continued under a new king Vithimer, who also had Hunnic allies on his side. After he died, the defense was led by two generals Alatheus and Saphrax, while Videricus, Vithimer's son, was a boy. In the meantime, Athanaric, now described by Ammianus as leader of the Tervingi, first moved to the Greuthungi position at the Dniester to block the westward movement of the Huns but was defeated, and then moved his people into a more defensible position further west near the [[Carpathians]]. \n\nIn 376 a large part of the Tervingi were allowed to cross the [[Lower Danube]] entering the Roman Empire with weapons. As tensions rose, Alatheus and Saphrax also crossed with Greuthingi and their king Videricus, despite their requests for permission having been rejected. Athanaric, who was apparently with them before they crossed, moved instead to a mountainous and forested region called Caucalanda, forcing Sarmatians out of the area. Alans and Huns also crossed in 377. The displacement of the Goths into the Balkans peninsula led to the [[Gothic War (376\u2013382)|Gothic War of 376\u2013382]] during which the Greuthungi were allied with the Tervingi. Greuthungi cavalry contributed to the decisive Gothic victory at the [[Battle of Adrianople]] of 9 August 378. In 382 there a more lasting settlement agreement was made for the large number of Goths to settle peacefully in the Balkans and contribute to the Roman military. Unfortunately, the details of this agreement are now unclear.\n\nIn 380, some of the Greuthungi under Alatheus and Saphrax appear to have separated from the main force of the Tervingi, invading the [[Diocese of Pannonia]] in the Northern Balkans, but were defeated by Emperor [[Gratian]]. The outcome of this invasion is unclear, it is possible that they were defeated and dispersed by [[Gratian]], or that they reached a separate peace agreement and settled in Pannonia.<ref>[[Peter Heather]], ''The Fall of the Roman Empire. A New History of Rome and the Barbarians'' (2005),  183&ndash;185.</ref>\n\nSeveral sources report more Greuthungi who were still outside of the empire in 386, under a leader from outside the Empire named [[Odotheus]]. He gathered large forces north of the Lower Danube, including peoples from far away. He attempted to cross the river, but was massacred by a Roman general named [[Promotus]].{{sfn|Christensen|2002|pages=213\u2013216}}\n\nIt appears to be these Greuthungi who were then settled in [[Phrygia]] and rebelled in 399-400. They are referred in a poem by [[Claudian]] which describes the Ostrogoths and Greuthungi inhabiting that land together, and fighting for the Roman military, ready to be aroused by some small offense and return to their natural ways.<ref>Concerning the Phrygian Greuthungi:\n*Claudian, ''Against Eutropius'', [https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Claudian/In_Eutropium/2*.html#141A 2.141]\n*Commentary relevant to the Greutungi: {{harvtxt|Wolfram|1988|p=24, 387fn52}}, {{harvtxt|Christensen|2002|pages=216\u2013217}}\n*On the connection to the 386 Greuthungi see {{cite journal|last=Heather |first=Peter |title=The Anti-Scythian Tirade of Synesius' \"De Regno\"| journal=Phoenix| volume= 42 |issue=2 |year=1988| page=156|doi=10.2307/1088231 |jstor=1088231}}\n*On the dating of Claudian's poem see {{citation|title=Claudian's In Eutropium: Or, How, When, and Why to Slander a Eunuch |first=Jacqueline |last=Long |year=1996 |chapter=5 |url=https://books.google.be/books?id=E-U6CwAAQBAJ}}.</ref> The poem associates this rebellious squadron (''alae'') in Phrygia with the Roman general of Gothic background, [[Tribigild]]. Claudian uses the term Ostrogoth once, and in other references to this same group he more often calls them Greuthungi or \"[[Getae|Getic]]\" (an older word used for Goths generally in this period). [[Zosimus]] also mentions Tribigild and the barbarian forces based in Phrygia, and their rebellion against the eunuch [[Eutropius (consul)|Eutropius the consul]] (died 399). [[Gainas]], the aggrieved Gothic general sent to fight him, joined forces with him after the death of Eutropius. Zosimus believed that was conspiracy between the two Goths from the beginning.<ref>Zosimus, ''New History'', [https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/New_History/Book_the_Fifth Book 5].

To the east of the Greuthungi, living near the Don river, were the [[Alans]].\n\nWhen the [[Huns]] arrived in the European Steppe region in the 4th century, first the Alans were forced to join them, and then a large part of the Greuthungi. Alans and Goths became an important part of [[Attila]]'s forces, together with other eastern European peoples. Other Greuthungi, together with some Alans and Huns, crossed the [[Lower Danube]] to join a large group of Tervingi who had entered the [[Roman empire]] in 376. These peoples defeated an imperial army in the [[Battle of Adrianople]] in 378, and came to a settlement agreement within the Roman empire by 382. \n\nThe original tribal names of the Goths fell out of use within the empire. Many of the 382 settlers appear to have been an important component of the [[Visigoths]] who formed under [[Alaric I]]. Based upon interpretations of the ''Getica'' by the 6th century writer [[Jordanes]], although it never mentions the Greuthungi, the Greuthungi are more strongly associated with both the Gothic king [[Ermanaric]], and the later [[Amal dynasty]] who were among Attila's Goths. After the collapse of Attila's empire, the Amals founded the [[Ostrogothic]] kingdom in the Roman Balkans.\n\n==Etymology==\nThe root ''greut-'' is probably related to the [[Old English]] ''greot'', meaning \"gravel, grit, earth\", thus implying that the name refers to a geographical region where the Greuthungi lived.<ref>Sch\u00f6feld, ''W\u00f6rterbuch der altgermanischen personen- und v\u00f6lkernamen'', [https://archive.org/details/wrterbuchderaltg00schn/page/113/ p.113]</ref><ref>{{citation|first=Thomas S. |last=Burns |title=A History of the Ostrogoths |publication-place=Bloomington |publisher=Indiana University Press |year=1984 |page=30 |url=https://books.google.be/books?id=dw3FEpOUrRkC}}</ref> \n\nIt has therefore been argued, for example by [[Herwig Wolfram]], who agrees with the older position of [[Franz Altheim]], that this is supported by evidence that geographic descriptors were commonly used to distinguish people living north of the Black Sea both before and after Gothic settlement there.<ref name=\"Wolfram387n58\">{{harvtxt|Wolfram|1988|page=388 n58}}</ref>\n\nMore specifically, he argues that ''Greuthungi'' may indicate that they lived on gritty steppes or \"pebbly coasts\", and should be seen as contrasting with the Tervingi, whose name may be related to the English word \"tree\" and indicate a forest origin.<ref name=\"Wolfram25\">{{citation|first=Herwig |last=Wolfram |title=History of the Goths | translator-last =Dunlap | translator-first =Thomas J. |publication-place=Berkeley |publisher=University of California Press |year=1988 |page=25 |url=https://books.google.be/books?id=xsQxcJvaLjAC}}</ref> \n\nIt has also been proposed that the name ''Greuthungi'' has pre-Pontic Scandinavian origins.<ref name=\"Wolfram387n58\"/> Wolfram for example notes that J. Svennung for example, has proposed that it may mean \"rock people\", and refer to a rocky homeland west of the [[Geats|Gauts]] in what is today Sweden.<ref name=\"Wolfram387n58\"/> \n\nIt has also been noted by some scholars, starting with [[Karl M\u00fcllenhoff]] in the 19th century, that in a list of peoples living on the island of [[Scandza]], [[Jordanes]] listed \"Mixi, Evagre, and Otingis\" among those who \"live like wild animals in rocks hewn out like castles\".<ref name=chr>Latin and translation given at {{cite book|last=Christensen |first=Arne S\u00f8by|title=Cassiodorus, Jordanes and the History of the Goths: Studies in a Migration Myth |year=2002| location=Copenhagen|publisher=Museum Tusculanum Press |url=https://books.google.be/books?id=AcLDHOqOt4cC |ref=harv|pages=267-268}}</ref> M\u00fcllenhoff proposed that the last part referred to the Greutungi, but no consensus has arisen to explain all the terms.{{sfn|Christensen|2002|pages=296\u2013298}}\n\n==History==\n{{see|Ostrogoths#History}}\nAn unreliable later text, the ''[[Historia Augusta]]'' text for the Emperor [[Probus]] (died 282), mentions the Greuthungi together with [[Vandals]] and [[Gepids]], who were supposedly settled in [[Thrace]] together with 100,000 [[Bastarnae]]. While the Bastarnae remained faithful, the other three peoples broke faith and were crushed by Probus.<ref>''Historia Augusta'', \"[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Historia_Augusta/Probus*.html Probus]\". See {{harvtxt|Christensen|2002|p=212}}.</ref> Still more doubtful, in the ''Historia Augusta'' article for Emperor [[Claudius Gothicus]] (reigned 268-270), the following list of \"[[Scythian]]\" peoples is given who had been conquered by the emperor when he earned his title \"Gothicus\": \"''peuci trutungi austorgoti uirtingi sigy pedes celtae etiam eruli''\". These words are traditionally edited by modern to include well-known peoples: \"''[[Peuci]], Grutungi, Austrogothi, Tervingi, Visi, Gipedes, [[Celts|Celtae]] etiam et [[Heruli|Eruli]]''\".{{sfn|Christensen|2002|pages=201\u2013205}}\n\nThe first event which can confidently be ascribed to the Greuthungi was much later, in the 369 campaign against the Goths by Emperor [[Valens]], in retribution for the support of the usurper [[Procopius (usurper)|Procopius]] (died 366). This was described by Ammianus writing in the 390s.<ref>Ammianus Marcellinus, ''Res Gestae'', [https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ammian/27*.html Book 27], 5.6.</ref> Valens crossed the Lower Danube at [[Noviodunum (castra)|Novidunum]] and went deep into Gothic territory where he came across the warlike people called the Greuthungi. Their apparent leader [[Athanaric]] who was, in this passage, described by Ammianus as their most powerful judge \"''iudicem potentissimum''\", was compelled to flee, and then make a peace agreement in the middle of the Danube, promising to never set foot on Roman soil. This same Athanaric is later described by Ammianus as a judge of the [[Tervingi]], raising questions about the nature of the distinction between the Tervingi and Greuthungi. Ammianus specifically describes the Greuthungi as Goths.{{sfn|Christensen|2002|page=212}}\n\nThe Greuthungi were next mentioned by Ammianus as defeated by the invading Huns in the early 370s.<ref>Ammianus Marcellinus, ''Res Gestae'', [https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Ammian/31*.html Book 31].</ref> The Huns first plundered and recruited the Alans of the Don river (the classical Tanais) and then attacked the domain of the warlike monarch King Ermenric, who was apparently king of the Greuthungi, who eventually committed suicide. \n\n[[Jordanes]] in his history of the Goths, the ''[[Getica]]'', written about 551, does not mention the Greuthungi, but instead writes as if the [[Ostrogoths]] and [[Visigoths]] of the 5th and 6th centuries already existed in the 3rd and 4th centuries. Jordanes does on the other hand describe a single large Gothic empire until the late 4th-century, ruled by Ermanaric. In contrast, [[Ammianus Marcellinus]], himself writing in the late 4th-century, mentions Ermanaric as the Greuthungi leader, but implies that his kingdom was relatively small compared to the large empire described by Jordanes.<ref>Heather, Peter, 1998, ''The Goths,'' Blackwell, Malden, pp. 53-55.</ref><ref>Kulikowski, Michael, 2007, ''Rome's Gothic Wars'', Cambridge University Press: Cambridge, pp. 54-56, 111-112.</ref>\n\nThe defense against the Huns and Alans continued under a new king Vithimer, who also had Hunnic allies on his side. After he died, the defense was led by two generals Alatheus and Saphrax, while Videricus, Vithimer's son, was a boy. In the meantime, Athanaric, now described by Ammianus as leader of the Tervingi, first moved to the Greuthungi position at the Dniester to block the westward movement of the Huns but was defeated, and then moved his people into a more defensible position further west near the [[Carpathians]]. \n\nIn 376 a large part of the Tervingi were allowed to cross the [[Lower Danube]] entering the Roman Empire with weapons. As tensions rose, Alatheus and Saphrax also crossed with Greuthingi and their king Videricus, despite their requests for permission having been rejected. Athanaric, who was apparently with them before they crossed, moved instead to a mountainous and forested region called Caucalanda, forcing Sarmatians out of the area. Alans and Huns also crossed in 377. The displacement of the Goths into the Balkans peninsula led to the [[Gothic War (376\u2013382)|Gothic War of 376\u2013382]] during which the Greuthungi were allied with the Tervingi. Greuthungi cavalry contributed to the decisive Gothic victory at the [[Battle of Adrianople]] of 9 August 378. In 382 there a more lasting settlement agreement was made for the large number of Goths to settle peacefully in the Balkans and contribute to the Roman military. Unfortunately, the details of this agreement are now unclear.\n\nIn 380, some of the Greuthungi under Alatheus and Saphrax appear to have separated from the main force of the Tervingi, invading the [[Diocese of Pannonia]] in the Northern Balkans, but were defeated by Emperor [[Gratian]]. The outcome of this invasion is unclear, it is possible that they were defeated and dispersed by [[Gratian]], or that they reached a separate peace agreement and settled in Pannonia.<ref>[[Peter Heather]], ''The Fall of the Roman Empire. A New History of Rome and the Barbarians'' (2005),  183&ndash;185.</ref>\n\nSeveral sources report more Greuthungi who were still outside of the empire in 386, under a leader from outside the Empire named [[Odotheus]]. He gathered large forces north of the Lower Danube, including peoples from far away. He attempted to cross the river, but was massacred by a Roman general named [[Promotus]].{{sfn|Christensen|2002|pages=213\u2013216}}\n\nIt appears to be these Greuthungi who were then settled in [[Phrygia]] and rebelled in 399-400. They are referred in a poem by [[Claudian]] which describes the Ostrogoths and Greuthungi inhabiting that land together, and fighting for the Roman military, ready to be aroused by some small offense and return to their natural ways.<ref>Concerning the Phrygian Greuthungi:\n*Claudian, ''Against Eutropius'', [https://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Claudian/In_Eutropium/2*.html#141A 2.141]\n*Commentary relevant to the Greutungi: {{harvtxt|Wolfram|1988|p=24, 387fn52}}, {{harvtxt|Christensen|2002|pages=216\u2013217}}\n*On the connection to the 386 Greuthungi see {{cite journal|last=Heather |first=Peter |title=The Anti-Scythian Tirade of Synesius' \"De Regno\"| journal=Phoenix| volume= 42 |issue=2 |year=1988| page=156|doi=10.2307/1088231 |jstor=1088231}}\n*On the dating of Claudian's poem see {{citation|title=Claudian's In Eutropium: Or, How, When, and Why to Slander a Eunuch |first=Jacqueline |last=Long |year=1996 |chapter=5 |url=https://books.google.be/books?id=E-U6CwAAQBAJ}}.</ref> The poem associates this rebellious squadron (''alae'') in Phrygia with the Roman general of Gothic background, [[Tribigild]]. Claudian uses the term Ostrogoth once, and in other references to this same group he more often calls them Greuthungi or \"[[Getae|Getic]]\" (an older word used for Goths generally in this period). [[Zosimus]] also mentions Tribigild and the barbarian forces based in Phrygia, and their rebellion against the eunuch [[Eutropius (consul)|Eutropius the consul]] (died 399). [[Gainas]], the aggrieved Gothic general sent to fight him, joined forces with him after the death of Eutropius. Zosimus believed that was conspiracy between the two Goths from the beginning.<ref>Zosimus, ''New History'', [https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/New_History/Book_the_Fifth Book 5].

He staged massive [[Rosary]] rallies in key cities of the world and extensively utilized mass communication, helped by world-recognized celebrities of [[Hollywood, Los Angeles, California|Hollywood]] at that time, promoting his ministry of binding families through prayer under the Family Rosary. Peyton was a popular and charismatic figure in [[Latin America]] and the [[Philippines]], where he promoted the [[Rosary]] and was known for his strong [[Irish people|Irish]] accent.\n\nPeyton popularized the phrases \"[[The family that prays together stays together]]\" and \"A world at prayer is a world at peace\".\n\n[[Pope Francis]] furthered Peyton towards sainthood by confirming his [[heroic virtue]] and naming him as [[Venerable]] on December 18, 2017.\n\n==Early life==\nPeyton was born Patrick Joseph Peyton in [[Attymass]], [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]],<ref name=chc>[http://holycrosscongregation.org/holy-ones/servant-of-god-patrick-peyton/ \"Venerable Patrick Peyton\", Congregation of Holy Cross]</ref> to subsistence-farmers John and Mary Gillard Peyton. Peyton was the sixth in a deeply religious family of four girls and five boys living in a small cottage at a 14-acre (5.66&nbsp;hectares) stony farmland near the foot of the Ox Mountains. Later on, some members of the family migrated to the United States.\n\nPeyton was sent to his mother's relatives in [[Bonniconlon]] to study at a school run by Tadhg O\u2019Leary in Bofield. As a young man, Peyton was rebellious and had moments of defying authority, resulting in dropping out of school. Despite the youthful rebellion, he remained close to his family, and deeply religious.\n\nBy his teen years, he was contemplating a vocation to become a priest. Although religious recruiters such as the [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchins]] and the [[Congregation of the Most Holy Redeemer|Redemptorist]] fathers visited Carracastle in search of young men wanting to pursue the priesthood, Peyton concentrated on helping his family earn a living when their father became too ill to work the farm. Some of his elder sisters were already in America and were sending remittances to help the family left in Ireland. In 1927, his sisters sent word that Patrick and his older brother Thomas could sail to the United States and join them in [[Scranton, Pennsylvania]]. On May 13, 1928, the Peyton brothers set sail.\n\n==America==\nThe brothers arrived in [[New York City|New York]] after a 10-day trip, traveling by steerage. The two took the train from New York to [[Pennsylvania]] and lived at the home of their already married sister Beatrice, who was working as a housekeeper for [[Thomas J. Baldrige]], the state Attorney General. Peyton's sister Nellie had already spoken to [[Monsignor]] Paul Kelly of [[St. Peter's Cathedral (Scranton, Pennsylvania)|Saint Peter's Cathedral]] and mentioned Peyton's interest in pursuing a [[Seminary|priestly vocation]]. Monsignor Kelly told Nellie to bring her younger brother Patrick to the cathedral as soon as he arrived. By June 1928, with hard luck in finding a job, Peyton finally met Monsignor Kelly and was offered a job of becoming the cathedral's [[Sexton (office)|sexton]]. In the words of Peyton at that time, \"a sexton was just another name for a janitor''.\"''\n\nPeyton took the job with initial hesitation but his daily presence at the cathedral brought back the calling for a vocation and he finally decided to pursue the priesthood. Monsignor Kelly insisted that Peyton should complete his high school education prior to admission to the [[novitiate]].  He and his older brother Thomas both pursued their religious vocations while working at the cathedral. During the spring of 1929, Father Pat Dolan of the [[Congregation of Holy Cross]] came to the cathedral in Scranton in search of new seminarians. Peyton and his brother Thomas entered the minor seminary of the Congregation of Holy Cross in [[Notre Dame, Indiana]].<ref name=chc/>\n\nAfter completing their high school studies at the Holy Cross School in [[Notre Dame, Indiana]], Peyton was admitted to the Moreau Seminary within the [[University of Notre Dame]] in 1932, where he pursued a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree, and excelled in [[Philosophy]]. He credited Cornelius Hagerty, a professor of ethics, as the one who provided him with counseling. As a young seminarian, Peyton was attracted to become a Holy Cross Father, for the order's focus on the Holy Family and towards obedience and conscience.\n\n==Marian devotion==\n[[File:Bartolom\u00e9 Esteban Perez Murillo - Virgin and Child with a Rosary - WGA16360.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Peyton hosted a number of televised shows abroad promoting the [[Rosary]], where an image of [[Bartolom\u00e9 Esteban Murillo]]'s painting of the [[Our Lady of the Rosary]] was always present in the background. Oil on canvas. [[Museo del Prado]].]]\n\nIn October 1938, during Peyton's second year of theology at [[Catholic University of America]], he was diagnosed with tuberculosis. He was transferred back to Notre Dame to the Infirmary. Father Cornelius Hagerty was influential in this stage of Peyton's life, encouraging the young seminarian to seek the help of the Blessed Virgin Mary. The doctors discovered that the patches in his lungs disappeared.<ref name=chc/>\n\nHe immediately packed his bags and left for Washington, D.C., to complete his theology studies and take his final vows. On June 15, 1941, Peyton and his brother Thomas were ordained at the [[Basilica of the Sacred Heart, Notre Dame|Basilica of the Sacred Heart]] at the University of Notre Dame as members of the Congregation of Holy Cross.<ref>[http://www.ncregister.com/daily-news/the-enduring-legacy-of-now-venerable-father-patrick-peyton Pronechen, Joseph. \"The Enduring Legacy of Now-\u2018Venerable\u2019 Father Patrick Peyton\", ''National Catholic Register'', January 4, 2018]</ref>\n\n==Lifetime crusade==\n{{Main|Family Rosary Crusade|Family Theater}}\nPeyton was given very light duties following the completion of his theological studies. His first assignment was in [[Albany, New York]], as the chaplain of the [[Holy Cross Brothers]] of the Vincentian Institute. Peyton started sending letters to bishops, Catholic laity, and other groups promoting the importance of families praying the Rosary as the war raged on.\n\nUtilizing radio, [[films]], [[outdoor advertising]] and later television, with the help of celebrities, artists and advertising practitioners, Peyton was one of the first pioneers of evangelism using [[mass media]]. He would also pioneer in conducting public rallies to bring families to pledge to pray the Rosary as a unit. These Rosary rallies attended by millions would become the most significant event where Peyton could be best remembered.  According to historian Hugh Wilford, \"Peyton himself was deeply conscious of the political dimension of his mission, proudly proclaiming in a 1946 radio broadcast, 'The rosary is the offensive weapon that will destroy Communism\u2014the great evil that seeks to destroy the faith'\" <ref>{{cite journal |last1=GRIBBLE |first1=RICHARD  |date=2003 |title=Anti-Communism, Patrick Peyton, CSC and the C.I.A. |journal=Journal of Church and State |volume=45 |issue=3 |pages=535\u2013558 |doi= 10.1093/jcs/45.3.535|jstor=23920511 }}</ref>\n\nThese Rosary Crusades were duplicated in different dioceses with attendees growing in numbers, taking Peyton across the globe from [[Brussels, Belgium]], to [[Madrid, Spain]], across Asia to [[Manila, Philippines]], down south of the [[equator]] to New Zealand and [[Papua New Guinea]] and into several South American cities like [[Lima, Peru]], to [[Rio de Janeiro]] in [[Brazil]]. With the help of a non-Catholic advertising practitioner, Peyton would popularize the slogan, \"The family that prays together stays together.\"\n\n==Death and legacy==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:father patrick peyton rosary rally philippines.gif|left|thumb|350px|Peyton shaking hands with [[Filipinos]] who gathered for the Rosary Rally in [[Archdiocese of Manila|Manila]]. 1953]] -->\n\nWith the [[Cold War]] threatening a new world peace, Peyton's work in promoting prayer, was recognized by the Holy See. His efforts earned him the title ''\"The Rosary Priest\".''\n\nControversy hounded Peyton throughout his ministry as some accused him of being a front for American intelligence during his missions in Latin America. Peyton's Rosary Crusades in Latin America were funded and, to some extent, directed by the [[Central Intelligence Agency]], which was interested in combating leftist political movements in Latin America.  This came about through Peyton's connection to [[J. Peter Grace]], the great-grandson of the founder of [[W.R. Grace and Company]], a multinational corporation with interests in transport, [[sugar]], and mining in South America, whom Peyton had met in 1946 on a trans-Atlantic voyage.  Grace, who was involved with other [[CIA]] front operations as well, wrote to John Moore, the chair of the Business Advisory Council, and the two men approached [[Allen Dulles]].  Dulles later met with Grace in the White House office of Vice President [[Richard Nixon]], who expressed enthusiasm.  The CIA decided for several years where the crusades would take place, and CIA funds were expended in [[Chile]], [[Brazil]], [[Venezuela]], and [[Colombia]], until Peyton's provincial superior, Richard H. Sullivan, learned of the secret funding from [[Theodore Hesburgh]], the chair of the board of trustees of the [[University of Notre Dame]], in October 1964.  It took the [[Holy See|Vatican]] more than a year and a half to oblige Peyton to give up his CIA financing.<ref>Hugh Wilford, ''The Mighty Wurlitzer: How the CIA Played America'' [Cambridge and London: Harvard University Press, 2008], pp.&nbsp;182\u201396 .</ref> While the CIA determined the locations of the Crusades, it did not influence the content or Peyton's goal of promoting family prayer, the Rosary and devotion to the Blessed Mother.\n\nOthers accused Peyton of living an ostentatious lifestyle, living a life with Hollywood artists who volunteered their efforts in helping promote his mission. But Peyton maintained that he never solicited funds for his ministry, and the well-off were more than generous to voluntarily donate a portion of their wealth all in the name of the Blessed Mother.\n\nPeyton died peacefully on June 3, 1992, holding a rosary, in a small room at the Little Sisters of the Poor Jeanne Jugan Residence in [[San Pedro, California]]. His remains were brought to the Holy Cross Cemetery on the grounds of [[Stonehill College]] in [[Easton, Massachusetts]].\n\nBefore Peyton died, he continued to work on what was to be the last major Rosary Rally. On December 8, 1992 at the [[Rizal Park]] in [[Manila]], [[Philippines]], Manila Archbishop [[Jaime Cardinal Sin]] led the celebrations for the Golden Jubilee Celebration of the [[Family Rosary Crusade]]. Then the Archbishop of Los Angeles, [[Roger Cardinal Mahony]] was sent as [[Papal Legate]] on behalf of [[Pope John Paul II]]. Among [[Filipino people|Filipino]] Catholics, Peyton is remembered for his Sunday televised shows, where he promoted the [[Rosary]] and [[Marian devotion]] along with his famous slogan. Peyton also encouraged many businesses to start making and selling large amounts of Rosaries for distribution, which he gave freely to impoverished Filipinos living in the slums.\n\nPeyton's work continues today in his original Ministries, Family Rosary, Family Theater and Family Rosary International, and in the Father Patrick Peyton Family Institute.\n\n==Sainthood==\nCardinal [[Se\u00e1n Patrick O'Malley|Sean Patrick O\u2019Malley]] announced a formal declaration opening the cause for [[sainthood]] of Father Peyton on June 1, 2001, a few days after receiving approval from the Vatican's [[Congregation for the Causes of the Saints]]. The declaration paved the way for the process of determining Peyton's holiness and in the process earning the revered title of \"[[Servant of God]]\".\n\nThe [[Positio]] was sent to the C.C.S. in 2015 for assessment and theologians approved his cause on 1 June 2017. [[Pope Francis]] named him as [[Venerable]] on 18 December 2017.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n* {{Citation\n|last=Peyton, CSC\n|first=Patrick\n|title=All For Her: An Autobiography of Father Patrick Peyton, CSC\n|publisher=Family Theater Publications, Hollywood California\n|origyear=1967|year=1996\n|asin= B0006CCAGY\n|url=http://www.christian-pages.com/si/2353.html}}.\n* {{Citation\n|last=Shiel\n|first=Tom\n|title=Cardinal urges Christians to twitter\n|publisher=Irish Times\n|date=April 27, 2009\n|isbn=\n|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2009/0427/1224245444798.html\n}}.\n* {{Citation\n |last        = Matilla\n |first       = Dexter R.\n |title       = 'Rosary priest' to be honored with sculpture\n |publisher   = Philippines Daily Inquirer\n |date        = March 31, 2009\n |url         = http://showbizandstyle.inquirer.net/lifestyle/lifestyle/view/20090427-201593/Rosary-priest-to-be-honored-with-sculpture\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20090430075846/http://showbizandstyle.inquirer.net/lifestyle/lifestyle/view/20090427-201593/Rosary-priest-to-be-honored-with-sculpture\n |archivedate = April 30, 2009\n}}.\n* {{Citation\n|last=Bourke\n|first=Toni\n|title=Fr Peyton remembered at 100th anniversary celebrations\n|publisher=Mayo Advertiser\n|date=April 17, 2009\n|isbn=\n|url=http://www.advertiser.ie/mayo/article/11149\n}}.\n* {{Citation\n|last=Schworm\n|first=Peter\n|title=Dozens in Easton pray for canonization of the 'Rosary Priest'\n|work=Boston Globe\n|date=June 8, 2008\n|isbn=\n|url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2008/06/08/dozens_in_easton_pray_for_canonization_of_the_rosary_priest/\n}}.\n* {{Citation\n|last=Gribble\n|first=Richard\n|title=Anti-communism, Patrick Peyton, CSC and the C.I.A.(Congregation of Holy Cross)\n|publisher=Journal of Church and State/J.M.

But Peyton maintained that he never solicited funds for his ministry, and the well-off were more than generous to voluntarily donate a portion of their wealth all in the name of the Blessed Mother.\n\nPeyton died peacefully on June 3, 1992, holding a rosary, in a small room at the Little Sisters of the Poor Jeanne Jugan Residence in [[San Pedro, California]]. His remains were brought to the Holy Cross Cemetery on the grounds of [[Stonehill College]] in [[Easton, Massachusetts]].\n\nBefore Peyton died, he continued to work on what was to be the last major Rosary Rally. On December 8, 1992 at the [[Rizal Park]] in [[Manila]], [[Philippines]], Manila Archbishop [[Jaime Cardinal Sin]] led the celebrations for the Golden Jubilee Celebration of the [[Family Rosary Crusade]]. Then the Archbishop of Los Angeles, [[Roger Cardinal Mahony]] was sent as [[Papal Legate]] on behalf of [[Pope John Paul II]]. Among [[Filipino people|Filipino]] Catholics, Peyton is remembered for his Sunday televised shows, where he promoted the [[Rosary]] and [[Marian devotion]] along with his famous slogan. Peyton also encouraged many businesses to start making and selling large amounts of Rosaries for distribution, which he gave freely to impoverished Filipinos living in the slums.\n\nPeyton's work continues today in his original Ministries, Family Rosary, Family Theater and Family Rosary International, and in the Father Patrick Peyton Family Institute.\n\n==Sainthood==\nCardinal [[Se\u00e1n Patrick O'Malley|Sean Patrick O\u2019Malley]] announced a formal declaration opening the cause for [[sainthood]] of Father Peyton on June 1, 2001, a few days after receiving approval from the Vatican's [[Congregation for the Causes of the Saints]]. The declaration paved the way for the process of determining Peyton's holiness and in the process earning the revered title of \"[[Servant of God]]\".\n\nThe [[Positio]] was sent to the C.C.S. in 2015 for assessment and theologians approved his cause on 1 June 2017. [[Pope Francis]] named him as [[Venerable]] on 18 December 2017.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n* {{Citation\n|last=Peyton, CSC\n|first=Patrick\n|title=All For Her: An Autobiography of Father Patrick Peyton, CSC\n|publisher=Family Theater Publications, Hollywood California\n|origyear=1967|year=1996\n|asin= B0006CCAGY\n|url=http://www.christian-pages.com/si/2353.html}}.\n* {{Citation\n|last=Shiel\n|first=Tom\n|title=Cardinal urges Christians to twitter\n|publisher=Irish Times\n|date=April 27, 2009\n|isbn=\n|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2009/0427/1224245444798.html\n}}.\n* {{Citation\n |last        = Matilla\n |first       = Dexter R.\n |title       = 'Rosary priest' to be honored with sculpture\n |publisher   = Philippines Daily Inquirer\n |date        = March 31, 2009\n |url         = http://showbizandstyle.inquirer.net/lifestyle/lifestyle/view/20090427-201593/Rosary-priest-to-be-honored-with-sculpture\n |url-status     = dead\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20090430075846/http://showbizandstyle.inquirer.net/lifestyle/lifestyle/view/20090427-201593/Rosary-priest-to-be-honored-with-sculpture\n |archivedate = April 30, 2009\n}}.\n* {{Citation\n|last=Bourke\n|first=Toni\n|title=Fr Peyton remembered at 100th anniversary celebrations\n|publisher=Mayo Advertiser\n|date=April 17, 2009\n|isbn=\n|url=http://www.advertiser.ie/mayo/article/11149\n}}.\n* {{Citation\n|last=Schworm\n|first=Peter\n|title=Dozens in Easton pray for canonization of the 'Rosary Priest'\n|work=Boston Globe\n|date=June 8, 2008\n|isbn=\n|url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2008/06/08/dozens_in_easton_pray_for_canonization_of_the_rosary_priest/\n}}.\n* {{Citation\n|last=Gribble\n|first=Richard\n|title=Anti-communism, Patrick Peyton, CSC and the C.I.A.(Congregation of Holy Cross)\n|publisher=Journal of Church and State/J.M.

Citing a dissatisfaction with their post-college careers and the business practices of contemporary video game developers, they decided to create their own company dedicated to making [[free-to-play]] games that constantly evolved and developed through player feedback. Beck and Merill recruited ''Defense of the Ancients'' veteran [[Steve Feak|Steve \"Guinsoo\" Feak]], as well as several other experienced developers, to help them build and refine the game that would later become ''League of Legends''.

Gaining champion levels in matches allows players to unlock their champion's special abilities and augment them in a number of ways unique to each character. If a champion loses all their health, they are defeated but are automatically revived in their base after enough time passes. Players also begin each match with a low amount of gold, and can earn additional gold throughout the match in a variety of ways: by killing non-player characters known as minions and monsters; by killing or helping to kill enemy players; by destroying enemy structures; passively over time; and through unique item interactions or champion abilities. This gold can then be spent throughout the match to buy in-game items that further augment each champion's abilities and gameplay in a variety of ways. Champion experience, gold earned, and items bought are specific to each match and do not carry over to subsequent matches. Thus, all players begin each match on a more-or-less equal footing relative to their opposing team.\n\nAcross matches, players also earn rewards that are applied to their account. Player accounts begin at level one and progress onward with games played. Player level is separate from character level; both a level 30 account and a level 5 account would begin at character level 1 at the start of a new game. From 2009\u20132017, the maximum account level was 30, and as players progressed, they unlocked additional content and abilities. This system was reworked in November 2017, with the removal of the level 30 limit and removal of a Runes / Masteries system that gave in-game bonuses to players based on their account level.<ref>[https://nexus.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/2017/09/upcoming-changes-to-leveling-ip-rewards/ Upcoming Changes To Leveling, IP, & Rewards] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107021307/https://nexus.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/2017/09/upcoming-changes-to-leveling-ip-rewards/ |date=November 7, 2017}}.

These structures continually create weak non-player characters known as minions, which advance toward the enemy base along three paths: top, middle, and bottom lanes. Players compete to advance these waves of minions into the enemy base, which allows them to destroy enemy structures and ultimately win the match. Between lanes are neutral areas of the map known as the 'jungle', arrayed in four quadrants. A shallow river divides the map between the teams, but doesn't actually impede movement; all champions can wade through it no differently than dry land.\n\nEach team wishes to defend its own structures and destroy the other team's structures. These include:<ref>{{cite web |url=https://boosteria.org/guides/league-legends-objectives-guide |title=League of Legends Objectives guide: Priority and Timers |work=boosteria.org |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305005126/https://boosteria.org/guides/league-legends-objectives-guide |archivedate=March 5, 2016 }}</ref>\n* Turrets \u2013 Each lane is guarded by powerful defensive structures called turrets. Turrets deal exceptionally high damage and will attack enemy minions and players that approach them. Turrets prioritize enemy minions in their vicinity, but will immediately attack enemy players if they attack allied players. Thus, by advancing an allied minion wave into the range of a turret, a player can do damage to the structure without themselves being attacked. When destroyed, turrets provide gold and experience. Turrets that are destroyed are destroyed permanently for that match and will not respawn. Some turrets, depending on location, will regenerate health over time if they are damaged but not destroyed.\n* Inhibitor \u2013 Each lane contains one inhibitor. A lane's inhibitor can be attacked after a team has destroyed the three turrets guarding its lane. Destroying an inhibitor will cause the allied Nexus to spawn Super Minions, more powerful Minions that provide a buff to surrounding Minions. If destroyed, inhibitors will respawn after five minutes.\n* Nexus \u2013 Each team has a Nexus that can only be damaged once all the turrets in a lane, that lane's inhibitor and the Nexus turrets are destroyed. Destruction of the enemy team's Nexus ends the game.\n\nSome objectives are 'neutral', meaning that they will not attack champions who pass by, but champions can choose to fight them if they wish to gain a reward at the cost of having to fight for it. They include:\n* Jungle monsters \u2013 Neutral monsters spawn at various intervals in the Jungle, and provides players with gold, experience, and sometimes other rewards for killing them. They are the most common neutral objective.<!-- Please do not add details about red buff and blue buff and their bonuses and transferring them. General overview, not specific.  -->\n* Elemental Drakes/Elder Dragon \u2013 Elemental drakes are powerful monsters located in the bottom half of the river. All members of the team that kills the drake are provided with buffs that last the entire game and accrue cumulatively. The drakes are flavored after the [[Classical element|Four Elements]], with each drake granting a thematically appropriate buff.  After a rework in 2019, three random different elemental drakes will spawn, with new ones coming six minutes after the previous one is killed.  After the third drake, all future drakes will be of that elemental type; once a team has slain 4 dragons, they get a \"Dragon Soul\" buff, and future dragon spawns are The Elder Dragon, which when killed provides a stronger buff than an individual elemental drake.\n* Rift Herald \u2013 The Rift Herald is a powerful enemy located in the upper side of the River. Killing the Rift Herald allows it to be summoned again as a battering ram to attack enemy towers.  From 2016&ndash;2019, it would not respawn after it is killed; after a rework in November 2019, it can potentially respawn once.<ref name=\"rift_herald2017\">[http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/featured/midseason-2017 Rift Herald] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170706153609/http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/featured/midseason-2017 |date=July 6, 2017}}</ref>\n* Baron Nashor \u2013 Baron Nashor is the most powerful neutral enemy, located in the upper side of the River. It will spawn after twenty minutes, replacing the Rift Herald. All living members of the team that kills Baron Nashor are given a buff which makes nearby minions more powerful. Baron Nashor will respawn seven minutes after it is killed.\n\nMany of the details have changed over time; ''League'' is not a static game, with mechanics being both introduced and removed since launch in 2009.

Living members of the team that slays Vilemaw are granted a temporary bonus, similar to the one granted by Baron Nashor.

These points count down from an initial score of 200. The first team to reduce the other team to 0 points wins.

The tutorial is played on the Howling Abyss and is intended to teach new players the rules and gameplay of ''League''.\n* Co-op Vs. AI is available to new players after completing or opting out of the Tutorial. It is played on Summoner's Rift, Twisted Treeline, and (formerly) the Crystal Scar, and pits teams of human players against an opposing team of computer-controlled artificial intelligence champions.\n* Normal Matchmaking uses an automated matchmaking system to pair teams of similarly-skilled players against one another.\n* Ranked Matchmaking is available to players upon reaching account level 30. It uses a similar system as Normal Matchmaking; however, pre-made teams must be of comparable ELO strength, so expert players and weak players are not allowed to team together in Ranked. After playing 8 or more Ranked games, accounts are given a public \"rank\" that roughly correlates with their ELO ranking.\n* Custom Games allow players to play any map with any combination of player or AI teammates and opponents.\n\n''League of Legends'' also includes three ways teams may choose what champion they will play for a given match:\n* Blind Pick allows the two teams to select their champions simultaneously. The players only learn the champion selections of the opposing team when the match begins. It is available on Summoner's Rift, Twisted Treeline, and the Crystal Scar for Normal Matchmaking games and Co-op vs. AI, and for all modes in custom games.\n* Draft Pick allows each team to ban five champions each (a total of ten champions banned), removing them from the match. Teams then take turns selecting their champions while being able to see the selections of the other team. It is available on Summoner's Rift for matchmaking games, and for all modes in custom games.\n* Random Pick randomly assigns a champion to each player. Players accumulate re-rolls by playing multiple matches, which they can use to randomly select another champion for that match. It is available on Howling Abyss for ARAM (All Random All Mid) games, and for all modes in custom games.\n\n=== Champion types ===\nThere are currently 148 champions in ''League of Legends'' as of January 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/game-info/champions/|title=Champions {{!}} League of Legends|website=na.leagueoflegends.com|access-date=2020-01-11}}</ref> ''League'' divides its champion types up a number of ways. The most salient difference is the type of damage a champion deals; some champions deal largely physical damage, which is resisted by the armor stat, and other champions deal largely magic damage, which is resisted by the magic resistance stat. Some champions deal with a combination of both and can choose which to emphasize; some rare abilities deal 'true' damage which is not mitigable by either armor or magic resistance. Riot Games has classified all champions as one of six types to aid beginners. Not all champions perfectly fit their type, of course. The official Riot classifications are as follows:\n* Marksman: Marksmen, also known as \"AD (attack damage) Carries\", are ranged champions that usually deal physical damage. These champions deal sustained damage over time rather than in a short burst, and are usually the best at destroying objectives like enemy turrets or elemental drakes. They tend to have weak defense in exchange for their high, exponentially scaling damage.\n* Mage: Mages, sometimes known as \"AP (ability power) Carries\", are champions with powerful magic damage and control skills, but weak defense and low mobility. Mages are a diverse set of champions. Some emphasize killing single champions from range very quickly; some specialize in area of effect damage to multiple targets whilst surviving in the middle of a fight; some specialize in immense range to attack enemies safely from afar. Some others blend up to two of these attributes. \n* Slayer: A champion who specializes in killing another champion quickly, most usually within melee range. These champions tend to go after the enemy's AD/AP Carry and other 'squishy' champions, but tend to have weak defenses themselves if caught. They are distinguished by having excellent mobility which allows them to reach and strike at priority targets. Slayers are divided between ''Assassins'' that flank and infiltrate enemies to select one target for death before escaping, and ''Skirmishers'' that rely more on strong sustained damage like a Marksman and unique defensive tools to remain in the fray.\n* [[Tank (gaming)|Tank]]: Champions who are hard to kill and soak up damage for their team. In exchange, they usually deal less damage but can compensate with useful \"crowd control\" abilities to distract or disable enemies or force enemies to fight through them first before they can attack the \"carries\". Tanks are divided between ''Vanguards'' that lead the charge into fights by disabling multiple enemies at once, and ''Wardens'' that are more concerned with protecting their own allies from enemy attacks.\n* Fighter: Champions that blend the attributes of a damage dealer and tank, combining moderate survivability with respectable damage. A common designation for close-range melee fighters, since they need to be able to survive long enough to close in on their target. There are two types of Fighters: ''Juggernauts'' that are largely immobile but have more extreme damage and survivability, and ''Divers'' that have more robust target selection at the cost of some survivability. \n* Controller: Champions whose skills are meant to directly aid the rest of the team by providing healing, buffing allies, debuffing the enemy team, disabling single targets, or a combination of the above. Typically referred to as \"support\" champions, controllers are often paired with another champion in the early laning phase of the game and focus on aiding their partner and harassing enemy champions rather than earning gold by slaying minions. Many different types of champions can serve as the \"support\", but tanks, healers, and certain types of mages are most common. Supports are expected to pay the most attention to the map as a whole, placing wards which grant vision and watching for surprise enemy movements.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/developer-corner/3A5uuBw7-champion-subclass-list|title=Champion Subclass List|author=James \"Stattik\" Bach|date=January 2015}}</ref>\n\nItem choice plays an important role in the above and can shift the style of a champion. For example, if the champion Jarvan IV purchases all damage items, he functions something like an Assassin; he can kill enemies quickly but dies rapidly himself. If Jarvan buys all defensive items, he's a Tank focused on disruption and buffing his allies. Somewhere in-between, he's a Fighter. In the same way, champions like Morgana or and Lux can build item sets that are focused on high damage like a Mage, or item sets focused on disrupting enemies and aiding allies like a Controller. A handful of champions in the game offer unique playstyles that do not fit neatly into any particular class.\n\n=== Featured game modes ===\nRiot Games, starting in 2013, has released a number of special limited-time game modes. These special modes would usually be accessible for two weeks, then retired. In 2016, Riot announced that \"Rotating Games Mode\" would be a recurring event, so that every weekend a previously released game mode would be made accessible again for that weekend.<ref>[https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/210354503-Rotating-Game-Modes-FAQ ROTATING GAME MODES FAQ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220160741/https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/210354503-Rotating-Game-Modes-FAQ |date=December 20, 2016}}</ref> Game modes include Ultra Rapid Fire (URF) and All Random Ultra Rapid Fire (ARURF), Hexakill (Twisted Treeline), One For All (Summoner's Rift), Nemesis Draft, Nexus Blitz, Nexus Siege, Legend of the Poro King, Doom Bots of Doom, and Hunt of the Blood Moon, Ascension, One For All (Howling Abyss), Hexakill (Summoner's Rift), Black Market Brawlers, Definitely Not Dominion, and Snowdown Showdown.\n\nThe Ultra Rapid Fire (URF) mode was originally a 2014 [[April Fools' Day]] prank that proved so popular it became a proper rotating game mode; in URF, champion abilities have no resource cost and have their cooldowns reduced by 80%, double the normal cap of 40% that can be attained through items. Additionally, champions have increased movement speed, reduced healing, faster passive gold gain, and faster attacks.<ref>{{cite web |title=Riot Broke League Of Legends, And Fans Love It |url=http://kotaku.com/riot-broke-league-of-legends-and-fans-love-it-1557292936 |work=Kotaku |accessdate=April 3, 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140404073054/http://kotaku.com/riot-broke-league-of-legends-and-fans-love-it-1557292936 |archivedate=April 4, 2014 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=League of Legends Releases Ultra Rapid Fire Mode |url=http://ca.ign.com/articles/2014/04/01/league-of-legends-releases-ultra-rapid-fire-mode |work=IGN |accessdate=April 3, 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== {{anchor|Teamfight Tactics}}''Teamfight Tactics'' ===\n{{Main|Teamfight Tactics}}\n''Teamfight Tactics'' is an [[auto battler]] game mode implemented on June 26, 2019.<ref name=\"AutobattlerIGN\">{{cite web |last1=Gilroy |first1=Joab |title=An Introduction to Auto Chess, Teamfight Tactics and Dota Underlords |url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/07/04/a-guide-to-auto-chess-tft-league-of-legends-teamfight-tactics-dota-underlords |website=IGN |accessdate=July 10, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Ye |first1=Josh |title=Auto battlers started with Dota Auto Chess and now Valve and Riot Games are joining in |url=https://www.abacusnews.com/who-what/auto-battlers-started-dota-auto-chess-and-now-valve-and-riot-games-are-joining/article/3017888 |website=Abacus |accessdate=17 July 2019}}</ref> Based on the ''[[Dota 2]]'' mod ''[[Dota Auto Chess]]'', the mode centers around a battlefield consisting of hexagons, which players may take turns to strategically place champions onto a game board.

RP can be used to purchase champions, champion skins, ward skins, summoner icons, emotes, and certain multi-game boosts. An additional currency, Blue Essence (BE) (known as Influence Points from 2009\u20132017), is earned by playing the game and leveling up. ''League of Legends'' is free-to-play and all in-game purchases with a material effect on game-play may be acquired by either RP or BE. The final currency, Orange Essence (OE), can be used to unlock champion skins, ward skins, summoner icons, and emotes via the \"Hextech Crafting\".\n\n==Setting and lore==\n''League of Legends'' takes place in the fictional world of Runeterra. In Runeterra, the champions of ''League of Legends'' are a collection of heroes and villains who have a variety of backstories, often related to the political struggles of the various countries of the main continent of Valoran. Additionally, some champions are extraplanar and come from worlds other than Runeterra, but are visiting for their own purposes. These champions sometimes clash with each other, roughly reflected in the gameplay of ''League of Legends''.\n\nThe setting has gone through two phases: the \"original\" setting that was canon from 2009\u20132014, and the rebooted setting from 2014\u2013present.<ref name=\"exploringruneterra\">{{cite web |url=http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/creative-spotlight/dev-blog-exploring-runeterra |title=Dev Blog: Exploring Runeterra |last=Gnox |first=Tommy |date=September 4, 2014 |publisher=Riot Games |access-date=December 3, 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161206170736/http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/creative-spotlight/dev-blog-exploring-runeterra/ |archivedate=December 6, 2016 }}</ref> The original setting was very focused on justifying the exact mechanics of a game of ''League'' in the world of Runeterra. The MOBA predecessor to ''League'', ''[[Defense of the Ancients]]'', featured two warring sides with two separate hero rosters; however, in ''League'', any combination of champions was legal to create a team. To explain this, in the original setting, Valoran was functionally ruled by extremely powerful time mages who could intimidate the other nations into compliance with their whims. They created the \"Institute of War\", also known as the \"League of Legends\", to resolve disputes and act as something like an international sports league. In these disputes, \"Summoners\" (a.k.a. the game player) could control any of Runeterra's greatest heroes or villains in their struggles, thus justifying why a team of 5 characters who all hated each other might form. Additionally, these time mages would actually power-down the characters to \"level 1\" before each match to make things 'fair'; some character's backstories even involved them explicitly having their powers sealed by the Institute of War due to them being too powerful otherwise, such as the demigoddesses Kayle and Morgana. This explained why characters might participate in multiple matches and have to relearn the same skills each time. After a match, a \"Judgment\" would sometimes be handed down, with the winning Summoners able to give land and privileges to those they favored.\n\nThe narrative team at Riot eventually decided this setup was too constraining, and \"rebooted\" the story behind ''League of Legends'' in 2014.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://kotaku.com/league-of-legends-just-destroyed-its-lore-will-start-o-1630783950 |title=League Of Legends Just Destroyed Its Lore, Will Start Over |last=Plunkett |first=Luke |date=September 4, 2014 |website=Kotaku |access-date=December 3, 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161216134356/http://kotaku.com/league-of-legends-just-destroyed-its-lore-will-start-o-1630783950 |archivedate=December 16, 2016 }}</ref> In essence, the original story put too much emphasis on the faceless player stand-in Summoners and the Time Mages of the Institute; \"the very idea of all-powerful Summoners made Champions little more than puppets manipulated by godlike powers.\"<ref name=\"exploringruneterra\" /> Any interesting champions the Narrative team created were rendered as secondary, mere servants to the Summoners, unable to influence their own destiny. Many champion's lore did not give them reason to join the Institute, such as serial killer fire spirit Brand or void monster Rek'Sai. Riot wished to let champions take the center stage and have stories of their own, pursuing their own unique goals. For example, Riot has since released a plotline about a lost empire in the Shurima desert<ref>[http://kotaku.com/league-of-legends-takes-its-new-lore-for-a-test-drive-1633297077 http://kotaku.com/league-of-legends-takes-its-new-lore-for-a-test-drive-1633297077] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220041007/http://kotaku.com/league-of-legends-takes-its-new-lore-for-a-test-drive-1633297077 |date=December 20, 2016}}</ref> and a plotline about a clash between the pirate Gangplank and the pirate-hunter Miss Fortune in the city of Bilgewater,<ref>[http://kotaku.com/league-of-legends-just-killed-off-a-champion-1720995935 League Of Legends Just Killed Off A Champion] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220043825/http://kotaku.com/league-of-legends-just-killed-off-a-champion-1720995935 |date=December 20, 2016}}</ref> both of which were driven by the champions of League of Legends, not Summoners.

In each game mode, teams work together to achieve a victory condition, typically destroying the core building (called the Nexus) in the enemy team's base after bypassing a line of defensive structures called turrets, or towers.\n\nIn all game modes, players control characters called champions, chosen or assigned every match, who each have a set of unique abilities.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://gameinfo.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/game-info/champions/ |title=Champions : League of Legends |publisher=[[Riot Games]] |accessdate=February 25, 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140228160823/http://gameinfo.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/game-info/champions/ |archivedate=February 28, 2014 }}</ref> Champions begin every match at a low [[Experience point|level]],<!-- Not always level 1.--> and then gain experience over the course of the match to achieve a maximum level of 18. Gaining champion levels in matches allows players to unlock their champion's special abilities and augment them in a number of ways unique to each character. If a champion loses all their health, they are defeated but are automatically revived in their base after enough time passes. Players also begin each match with a low amount of gold, and can earn additional gold throughout the match in a variety of ways: by killing non-player characters known as minions and monsters; by killing or helping to kill enemy players; by destroying enemy structures; passively over time; and through unique item interactions or champion abilities. This gold can then be spent throughout the match to buy in-game items that further augment each champion's abilities and gameplay in a variety of ways. Champion experience, gold earned, and items bought are specific to each match and do not carry over to subsequent matches. Thus, all players begin each match on a more-or-less equal footing relative to their opposing team.\n\nAcross matches, players also earn rewards that are applied to their account. Player accounts begin at level one and progress onward with games played. Player level is separate from character level; both a level 30 account and a level 5 account would begin at character level 1 at the start of a new game. From 2009\u20132017, the maximum account level was 30, and as players progressed, they unlocked additional content and abilities. This system was reworked in November 2017, with the removal of the level 30 limit and removal of a Runes / Masteries system that gave in-game bonuses to players based on their account level.<ref>[https://nexus.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/2017/09/upcoming-changes-to-leveling-ip-rewards/ Upcoming Changes To Leveling, IP, & Rewards] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107021307/https://nexus.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/2017/09/upcoming-changes-to-leveling-ip-rewards/ |date=November 7, 2017}}.

In the past, two other maps were featured as well, although they have since been discontinued.  Each map has different terrain, objectives as well as varied summoner spells and items.\n\n====Summoner's Rift====\n[[File:Map of MOBA.svg|thumb|240px|A simplified representation of Summoner's Rift. The yellow paths are the \"lanes\" where endless waves of troops known as minions march; blue and red dots are the defensive turrets that defend the lanes. Not pictured are the two turrets that flank each Nexus \u2013 the ultimate goal of the game, which are within each team's base in their corner. The dotted black line is the river that divides the sides.]]\n\nSummoner's Rift is the most popular map in ''League of Legends''.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" /> On this map type, two teams of five players compete to destroy an enemy building called a Nexus, which is guarded by the enemy team and a number of defensive structures called turrets, or towers.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\">{{cite web |url=http://gameinfo.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/game-info/game-modes/summoners-rift/ |title=Summoner's Rift |work=leagueoflegends.com |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150905055218/http://gameinfo.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/game-info/game-modes/summoners-rift/ |archivedate=September 5, 2015 }}</ref> One nexus is located in each enemy base on opposite sides of the map, in the lower-left and upper-right hand corners. These structures continually create weak non-player characters known as minions, which advance toward the enemy base along three paths: top, middle, and bottom lanes. Players compete to advance these waves of minions into the enemy base, which allows them to destroy enemy structures and ultimately win the match. Between lanes are neutral areas of the map known as the 'jungle', arrayed in four quadrants. A shallow river divides the map between the teams, but doesn't actually impede movement; all champions can wade through it no differently than dry land.\n\nEach team wishes to defend its own structures and destroy the other team's structures. These include:<ref>{{cite web |url=https://boosteria.org/guides/league-legends-objectives-guide |title=League of Legends Objectives guide: Priority and Timers |work=boosteria.org |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305005126/https://boosteria.org/guides/league-legends-objectives-guide |archivedate=March 5, 2016 }}</ref>\n* Turrets \u2013 Each lane is guarded by powerful defensive structures called turrets. Turrets deal exceptionally high damage and will attack enemy minions and players that approach them. Turrets prioritize enemy minions in their vicinity, but will immediately attack enemy players if they attack allied players. Thus, by advancing an allied minion wave into the range of a turret, a player can do damage to the structure without themselves being attacked. When destroyed, turrets provide gold and experience. Turrets that are destroyed are destroyed permanently for that match and will not respawn. Some turrets, depending on location, will regenerate health over time if they are damaged but not destroyed.\n* Inhibitor \u2013 Each lane contains one inhibitor. A lane's inhibitor can be attacked after a team has destroyed the three turrets guarding its lane. Destroying an inhibitor will cause the allied Nexus to spawn Super Minions, more powerful Minions that provide a buff to surrounding Minions. If destroyed, inhibitors will respawn after five minutes.\n* Nexus \u2013 Each team has a Nexus that can only be damaged once all the turrets in a lane, that lane's inhibitor and the Nexus turrets are destroyed. Destruction of the enemy team's Nexus ends the game.\n\nSome objectives are 'neutral', meaning that they will not attack champions who pass by, but champions can choose to fight them if they wish to gain a reward at the cost of having to fight for it. They include:\n* Jungle monsters \u2013 Neutral monsters spawn at various intervals in the Jungle, and provides players with gold, experience, and sometimes other rewards for killing them. They are the most common neutral objective.<!-- Please do not add details about red buff and blue buff and their bonuses and transferring them. General overview, not specific.  -->\n* Elemental Drakes/Elder Dragon \u2013 Elemental drakes are powerful monsters located in the bottom half of the river. All members of the team that kills the drake are provided with buffs that last the entire game and accrue cumulatively. The drakes are flavored after the [[Classical element|Four Elements]], with each drake granting a thematically appropriate buff.  After a rework in 2019, three random different elemental drakes will spawn, with new ones coming six minutes after the previous one is killed.  After the third drake, all future drakes will be of that elemental type; once a team has slain 4 dragons, they get a \"Dragon Soul\" buff, and future dragon spawns are The Elder Dragon, which when killed provides a stronger buff than an individual elemental drake.\n* Rift Herald \u2013 The Rift Herald is a powerful enemy located in the upper side of the River. Killing the Rift Herald allows it to be summoned again as a battering ram to attack enemy towers.  From 2016&ndash;2019, it would not respawn after it is killed; after a rework in November 2019, it can potentially respawn once.<ref name=\"rift_herald2017\">[http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/featured/midseason-2017 Rift Herald] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170706153609/http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/featured/midseason-2017 |date=July 6, 2017}}</ref>\n* Baron Nashor \u2013 Baron Nashor is the most powerful neutral enemy, located in the upper side of the River. It will spawn after twenty minutes, replacing the Rift Herald. All living members of the team that kills Baron Nashor are given a buff which makes nearby minions more powerful. Baron Nashor will respawn seven minutes after it is killed.\n\nMany of the details have changed over time; ''League'' is not a static game, with mechanics being both introduced and removed since launch in 2009. For example, the Rift Herald was only added in 2016, and had its abilities reworked in 2017 and in late 2019;<ref>[https://na.leagueoflegends.com/na/site/2016-season-update/preseason.html 2016 Season Update] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171107020148/https://na.leagueoflegends.com/na/site/2016-season-update/preseason.html |date=November 7, 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"rift_herald2017\" /> Dragons gave gold rather than buffs from 2009\u20132014, and the dragons only became elementally flavored drakes in 2016; jungle monsters have been added and reworked; the length of time it took for inhibitors to respawn was 4 minutes rather than 5 minutes for a time; Baron Nashor gave a stronger buff to the statistics of champions but no buff to minions from 2009\u20132014; and so on.\n\n====Howling Abyss====\nThe Howling Abyss is used for \"ARAM\" (All Random All Mid) matches, and is five vs. five.<ref name=\"ReferenceB\" /> The difference between the Abyss and the other maps is that there is only a single narrow lane of turrets and an inhibitor and no neutral jungle area. Thus, rather than skirmishes and hidden movement, the Abyss focuses exclusively on large team-fights in the sole middle lane. Players cannot return to their allied base to replenish health and mana or purchase items unless they have been killed.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\" /> ARAM was launched as an official mode in September 2013.<ref name=\"escapistARAM\">[http://www.escapistmagazine.com/forums/read/7.406935-League-Of-Legends-All-Random-All-Mid-Mode-Gets-Official League Of Legends' \"All Random All Mid\" Mode Gets Official] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170629142319/http://www.escapistmagazine.com/forums/read/7.406935-League-Of-Legends-All-Random-All-Mid-Mode-Gets-Official |date=June 29, 2017}}</ref>\n\n====Twisted Treeline====\nIn the Twisted Treeline, two teams of three players compete to destroy the opposing team's Nexus, which is guarded enemy Towers.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\">{{cite web |url=http://gameinfo.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/game-info/game-modes/the-twisted-treeline/ |title=The Twisted Treeline |work=leagueoflegends.com |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150702044249/http://gameinfo.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/game-info/game-modes/the-twisted-treeline/ |archivedate=July 2, 2015 }}</ref> It is conceptually similar to Summoner's Rift, but smaller to account for three vs. three rather than five vs. five.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\" /> Rather than Summoner's Rift 3 lanes of turrets and 3 inhibitors, Twisted Treeline has only 2 lanes and 2 inhibitors, with the jungle in between. The other differences are the addition of two \"Altars\", control of which grants the occupying team a variety of bonuses, and the replacement of Baron Nashor with Vilemaw, an evil spider deity. Living members of the team that slays Vilemaw are granted a temporary bonus, similar to the one granted by Baron Nashor.  Riot Games retired the mode in November 2019, due to declining playership.<ref>[https://dotesports.com/league-of-legends/news/league-of-legends-twisted-treeline-will-be-retired-later-this-year League of Legends' Twisted Treeline will be retired later this year]</ref><ref name=\"tt-goodbye\" />\n\n====Crystal Scar====\nThe Crystal Scar was used for Dominion mode, a discontinued game format where teams of five players competed to capture control points and hold those points for the longest possible period of time.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://gameinfo.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/game-info/game-modes/the-crystal-scar |title=The Crystal Scar |work=leagueoflegends.com |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140125153342/http://gameinfo.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/game-info/game-modes/the-crystal-scar/ |archivedate=January 25, 2014 }}</ref> The map consists of a circle with 5 control points. Each team controls a base known as a fountain, located at the bottom left and right-hand corners of the map. Each team scores points by capturing and owning more objectives than the other team over time, which is then reduced from the other team's \"life\" total. These points count down from an initial score of 200. The first team to reduce the other team to 0 points wins. Dominion was launched on September 26, 2011 and was retired on February 22, 2016, although the Crystal Scar is used for certain other rotating formats, such as Ascension.<ref>[http://www.gamespot.com/articles/league-of-legends-dominion-mode-launches/1100-6336613/ League of Legends: Dominion mode launches] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170822014211/https://www.gamespot.com/articles/league-of-legends-dominion-mode-launches/1100-6336613/ |date=August 22, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/features/retiring-dominion |title=Retiring Dominion |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160316081135/http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/news/game-updates/features/retiring-dominion |archivedate=March 16, 2016 }}</ref>\n\n===Games types===\n''League of Legends'' includes several game types players can select.<ref name=\"gameinfo.na.leagueoflegends.com\" /><ref>{{cite web |url=https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752954-Matchmaking-Guide |title=Matchmaking Guide |work=Riot Games Support |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906181359/https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/201752954-Matchmaking-Guide |archivedate=September 6, 2015 |access-date=September 18, 2015 }}</ref>\n* The Tutorial is the first game type available to new players. The tutorial is played on the Howling Abyss and is intended to teach new players the rules and gameplay of ''League''.\n* Co-op Vs. AI is available to new players after completing or opting out of the Tutorial. It is played on Summoner's Rift, Twisted Treeline, and (formerly) the Crystal Scar, and pits teams of human players against an opposing team of computer-controlled artificial intelligence champions.\n* Normal Matchmaking uses an automated matchmaking system to pair teams of similarly-skilled players against one another.\n* Ranked Matchmaking is available to players upon reaching account level 30. It uses a similar system as Normal Matchmaking; however, pre-made teams must be of comparable ELO strength, so expert players and weak players are not allowed to team together in Ranked. After playing 8 or more Ranked games, accounts are given a public \"rank\" that roughly correlates with their ELO ranking.\n* Custom Games allow players to play any map with any combination of player or AI teammates and opponents.\n\n''League of Legends'' also includes three ways teams may choose what champion they will play for a given match:\n* Blind Pick allows the two teams to select their champions simultaneously. The players only learn the champion selections of the opposing team when the match begins. It is available on Summoner's Rift, Twisted Treeline, and the Crystal Scar for Normal Matchmaking games and Co-op vs. AI, and for all modes in custom games.\n* Draft Pick allows each team to ban five champions each (a total of ten champions banned), removing them from the match. Teams then take turns selecting their champions while being able to see the selections of the other team. It is available on Summoner's Rift for matchmaking games, and for all modes in custom games.\n* Random Pick randomly assigns a champion to each player. Players accumulate re-rolls by playing multiple matches, which they can use to randomly select another champion for that match. It is available on Howling Abyss for ARAM (All Random All Mid) games, and for all modes in custom games.\n\n=== Champion types ===\nThere are currently 148 champions in ''League of Legends'' as of January 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/game-info/champions/|title=Champions {{!}} League of Legends|website=na.leagueoflegends.com|access-date=2020-01-11}}</ref> ''League'' divides its champion types up a number of ways. The most salient difference is the type of damage a champion deals; some champions deal largely physical damage, which is resisted by the armor stat, and other champions deal largely magic damage, which is resisted by the magic resistance stat. Some champions deal with a combination of both and can choose which to emphasize; some rare abilities deal 'true' damage which is not mitigable by either armor or magic resistance. Riot Games has classified all champions as one of six types to aid beginners. Not all champions perfectly fit their type, of course. The official Riot classifications are as follows:\n* Marksman: Marksmen, also known as \"AD (attack damage) Carries\", are ranged champions that usually deal physical damage. These champions deal sustained damage over time rather than in a short burst, and are usually the best at destroying objectives like enemy turrets or elemental drakes. They tend to have weak defense in exchange for their high, exponentially scaling damage.\n* Mage: Mages, sometimes known as \"AP (ability power) Carries\", are champions with powerful magic damage and control skills, but weak defense and low mobility. Mages are a diverse set of champions. Some emphasize killing single champions from range very quickly; some specialize in area of effect damage to multiple targets whilst surviving in the middle of a fight; some specialize in immense range to attack enemies safely from afar. Some others blend up to two of these attributes. \n* Slayer: A champion who specializes in killing another champion quickly, most usually within melee range. These champions tend to go after the enemy's AD/AP Carry and other 'squishy' champions, but tend to have weak defenses themselves if caught. They are distinguished by having excellent mobility which allows them to reach and strike at priority targets. Slayers are divided between ''Assassins'' that flank and infiltrate enemies to select one target for death before escaping, and ''Skirmishers'' that rely more on strong sustained damage like a Marksman and unique defensive tools to remain in the fray.\n* [[Tank (gaming)|Tank]]: Champions who are hard to kill and soak up damage for their team. In exchange, they usually deal less damage but can compensate with useful \"crowd control\" abilities to distract or disable enemies or force enemies to fight through them first before they can attack the \"carries\". Tanks are divided between ''Vanguards'' that lead the charge into fights by disabling multiple enemies at once, and ''Wardens'' that are more concerned with protecting their own allies from enemy attacks.\n* Fighter: Champions that blend the attributes of a damage dealer and tank, combining moderate survivability with respectable damage. A common designation for close-range melee fighters, since they need to be able to survive long enough to close in on their target. There are two types of Fighters: ''Juggernauts'' that are largely immobile but have more extreme damage and survivability, and ''Divers'' that have more robust target selection at the cost of some survivability. \n* Controller: Champions whose skills are meant to directly aid the rest of the team by providing healing, buffing allies, debuffing the enemy team, disabling single targets, or a combination of the above. Typically referred to as \"support\" champions, controllers are often paired with another champion in the early laning phase of the game and focus on aiding their partner and harassing enemy champions rather than earning gold by slaying minions. Many different types of champions can serve as the \"support\", but tanks, healers, and certain types of mages are most common. Supports are expected to pay the most attention to the map as a whole, placing wards which grant vision and watching for surprise enemy movements.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://boards.na.leagueoflegends.com/en/c/developer-corner/3A5uuBw7-champion-subclass-list|title=Champion Subclass List|author=James \"Stattik\" Bach|date=January 2015}}</ref>\n\nItem choice plays an important role in the above and can shift the style of a champion. For example, if the champion Jarvan IV purchases all damage items, he functions something like an Assassin; he can kill enemies quickly but dies rapidly himself. If Jarvan buys all defensive items, he's a Tank focused on disruption and buffing his allies. Somewhere in-between, he's a Fighter. In the same way, champions like Morgana or and Lux can build item sets that are focused on high damage like a Mage, or item sets focused on disrupting enemies and aiding allies like a Controller. A handful of champions in the game offer unique playstyles that do not fit neatly into any particular class.\n\n=== Featured game modes ===\nRiot Games, starting in 2013, has released a number of special limited-time game modes. These special modes would usually be accessible for two weeks, then retired. In 2016, Riot announced that \"Rotating Games Mode\" would be a recurring event, so that every weekend a previously released game mode would be made accessible again for that weekend.<ref>[https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/210354503-Rotating-Game-Modes-FAQ ROTATING GAME MODES FAQ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220160741/https://support.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/articles/210354503-Rotating-Game-Modes-FAQ |date=December 20, 2016}}</ref> Game modes include Ultra Rapid Fire (URF) and All Random Ultra Rapid Fire (ARURF), Hexakill (Twisted Treeline), One For All (Summoner's Rift), Nemesis Draft, Nexus Blitz, Nexus Siege, Legend of the Poro King, Doom Bots of Doom, and Hunt of the Blood Moon, Ascension, One For All (Howling Abyss), Hexakill (Summoner's Rift), Black Market Brawlers, Definitely Not Dominion, and Snowdown Showdown.\n\nThe Ultra Rapid Fire (URF) mode was originally a 2014 [[April Fools' Day]] prank that proved so popular it became a proper rotating game mode; in URF, champion abilities have no resource cost and have their cooldowns reduced by 80%, double the normal cap of 40% that can be attained through items. Additionally, champions have increased movement speed, reduced healing, faster passive gold gain, and faster attacks.<ref>{{cite web |title=Riot Broke League Of Legends, And Fans Love It |url=http://kotaku.com/riot-broke-league-of-legends-and-fans-love-it-1557292936 |work=Kotaku |accessdate=April 3, 2014 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140404073054/http://kotaku.com/riot-broke-league-of-legends-and-fans-love-it-1557292936 |archivedate=April 4, 2014 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=League of Legends Releases Ultra Rapid Fire Mode |url=http://ca.ign.com/articles/2014/04/01/league-of-legends-releases-ultra-rapid-fire-mode |work=IGN |accessdate=April 3, 2014}}</ref>\n\n=== {{anchor|Teamfight Tactics}}''Teamfight Tactics'' ===\n{{Main|Teamfight Tactics}}\n''Teamfight Tactics'' is an [[auto battler]] game mode implemented on June 26, 2019.<ref name=\"AutobattlerIGN\">{{cite web |last1=Gilroy |first1=Joab |title=An Introduction to Auto Chess, Teamfight Tactics and Dota Underlords |url=https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/07/04/a-guide-to-auto-chess-tft-league-of-legends-teamfight-tactics-dota-underlords |website=IGN |accessdate=July 10, 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Ye |first1=Josh |title=Auto battlers started with Dota Auto Chess and now Valve and Riot Games are joining in |url=https://www.abacusnews.com/who-what/auto-battlers-started-dota-auto-chess-and-now-valve-and-riot-games-are-joining/article/3017888 |website=Abacus |accessdate=17 July 2019}}</ref> Based on the ''[[Dota 2]]'' mod ''[[Dota Auto Chess]]'', the mode centers around a battlefield consisting of hexagons, which players may take turns to strategically place champions onto a game board.

RP can be used to purchase champions, champion skins, ward skins, summoner icons, emotes, and certain multi-game boosts. An additional currency, Blue Essence (BE) (known as Influence Points from 2009\u20132017), is earned by playing the game and leveling up. ''League of Legends'' is free-to-play and all in-game purchases with a material effect on game-play may be acquired by either RP or BE. The final currency, Orange Essence (OE), can be used to unlock champion skins, ward skins, summoner icons, and emotes via the \"Hextech Crafting\".\n\n==Setting and lore==\n''League of Legends'' takes place in the fictional world of Runeterra. In Runeterra, the champions of ''League of Legends'' are a collection of heroes and villains who have a variety of backstories, often related to the political struggles of the various countries of the main continent of Valoran. Additionally, some champions are extraplanar and come from worlds other than Runeterra, but are visiting for their own purposes. These champions sometimes clash with each other, roughly reflected in the gameplay of ''League of Legends''.\n\nThe setting has gone through two phases: the \"original\" setting that was canon from 2009\u20132014, and the rebooted setting from 2014\u2013present.<ref name=\"exploringruneterra\">{{cite web |url=http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/creative-spotlight/dev-blog-exploring-runeterra |title=Dev Blog: Exploring Runeterra |last=Gnox |first=Tommy |date=September 4, 2014 |publisher=Riot Games |access-date=December 3, 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161206170736/http://na.leagueoflegends.com/en/creative-spotlight/dev-blog-exploring-runeterra/ |archivedate=December 6, 2016 }}</ref> The original setting was very focused on justifying the exact mechanics of a game of ''League'' in the world of Runeterra. The MOBA predecessor to ''League'', ''[[Defense of the Ancients]]'', featured two warring sides with two separate hero rosters; however, in ''League'', any combination of champions was legal to create a team. To explain this, in the original setting, Valoran was functionally ruled by extremely powerful time mages who could intimidate the other nations into compliance with their whims. They created the \"Institute of War\", also known as the \"League of Legends\", to resolve disputes and act as something like an international sports league. In these disputes, \"Summoners\" (a.k.a. the game player) could control any of Runeterra's greatest heroes or villains in their struggles, thus justifying why a team of 5 characters who all hated each other might form. Additionally, these time mages would actually power-down the characters to \"level 1\" before each match to make things 'fair'; some character's backstories even involved them explicitly having their powers sealed by the Institute of War due to them being too powerful otherwise, such as the demigoddesses Kayle and Morgana. This explained why characters might participate in multiple matches and have to relearn the same skills each time. After a match, a \"Judgment\" would sometimes be handed down, with the winning Summoners able to give land and privileges to those they favored.\n\nThe narrative team at Riot eventually decided this setup was too constraining, and \"rebooted\" the story behind ''League of Legends'' in 2014.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://kotaku.com/league-of-legends-just-destroyed-its-lore-will-start-o-1630783950 |title=League Of Legends Just Destroyed Its Lore, Will Start Over |last=Plunkett |first=Luke |date=September 4, 2014 |website=Kotaku |access-date=December 3, 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161216134356/http://kotaku.com/league-of-legends-just-destroyed-its-lore-will-start-o-1630783950 |archivedate=December 16, 2016 }}</ref> In essence, the original story put too much emphasis on the faceless player stand-in Summoners and the Time Mages of the Institute; \"the very idea of all-powerful Summoners made Champions little more than puppets manipulated by godlike powers.\"<ref name=\"exploringruneterra\" /> Any interesting champions the Narrative team created were rendered as secondary, mere servants to the Summoners, unable to influence their own destiny. Many champion's lore did not give them reason to join the Institute, such as serial killer fire spirit Brand or void monster Rek'Sai. Riot wished to let champions take the center stage and have stories of their own, pursuing their own unique goals. For example, Riot has since released a plotline about a lost empire in the Shurima desert<ref>[http://kotaku.com/league-of-legends-takes-its-new-lore-for-a-test-drive-1633297077 http://kotaku.com/league-of-legends-takes-its-new-lore-for-a-test-drive-1633297077] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220041007/http://kotaku.com/league-of-legends-takes-its-new-lore-for-a-test-drive-1633297077 |date=December 20, 2016}}</ref> and a plotline about a clash between the pirate Gangplank and the pirate-hunter Miss Fortune in the city of Bilgewater,<ref>[http://kotaku.com/league-of-legends-just-killed-off-a-champion-1720995935 League Of Legends Just Killed Off A Champion] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220043825/http://kotaku.com/league-of-legends-just-killed-off-a-champion-1720995935 |date=December 20, 2016}}</ref> both of which were driven by the champions of League of Legends, not Summoners.

However, the game's confusing launch was criticized: it was felt that the title was released too early, with some features missing and others to be removed. Finally, the reviewer noted that high level players in the game have \"little patience for newcomers\", though the reviewer believed that matchmaking (not implemented at the time of review) would solve the problem by matching players of similar level together.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://uk.pc.ign.com/articles/104/1042996p1.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091110061331/http://uk.pc.ign.com/articles/104/1042996p1.html |title=League of Legends Review |work=IGN |author=Butts, Steve |archivedate=November 10, 2009 |accessdate=May 23, 2010 |quote=The strategy elements are sound, and it can be fun to just pick a lane and start chewing through minions as you work your way towards enemy towers and champions. But sometimes it feels like League of Legends throws too much at the player, both in terms of the number of champions and the general confusion of the larger battles. While that's not enough to dampen your enthusiasm of the game, the vague status of the launch and the more-than-occasional hostility of the community just might.}}</ref>\n\nLeah B.
