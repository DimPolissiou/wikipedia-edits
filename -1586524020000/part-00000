The material she chooses to work with, some by noted authors, others self penned, is delivered in Parton's little girl-sounding vocals. Her sweet-flowing voice becomes more and more likeable on each cut, emitting a warm innocence. The delicate string and horn accompaniment adds to the breezy, more subtle country effect. And the strong guitar work, pedal steel included, doesn't distract from Parton's vocals. Parton's title track single, which she sang on the Rock Awards television broadcast, is a sure bet to crack the Hot 100.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=Billboard Magazine - October 15, 1977 |url=https://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Billboard/70s/1977/Billboard%201977-10-15.pdf |website=American Radio History |publisher=Billboard Magazine |accessdate=7 December 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn the October 22, 1977 issue, ''[[Cashbox (magazine)|Cashbox]]'' published a review saying, \"Dolly's winning ways have convinced more than a few former non-believers that country and western audiences have no right to a monopoly on this songbird's talents. With this album, Dolly takes a giant step into the pop mainstream with a spicy repertoire that features only an occasional banjo or pedal steel lick. But even those who have seen her perform will have to be at least mildly surprised at how naturally proficient Dolly is at jumping into a completely new bag.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=Cashbox Magazine - October 22, 1977 |url=https://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Cash-Box/70s/1977/CB-1977-10-22.pdf |website=American Radio History |publisher=Cashbox Magazine |accessdate=7 December 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Commercial performance==\nThe album peaked at No. 1 on the US ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Top Country Albums|Hot Country LPs]] chart and No. 20 on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart. In Canada, the album peaked at No. 12 on the ''[[RPM (magazine)|RPM]]'' Canadian Albums chart.\n\nThe album's first single, \"Here You Come Again\", was released in October 1977 and peaked at No. 1 on the US ''Billboard'' [[Hot Country Songs|Hot Country Singles]] chart, No. 3 on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and No. 2 on the US ''Billboard'' Easy Listening chart. In Canada, the single peaked at No. 1 on the ''RPM'' Canadian Country Singles chart, No. 7 on the ''RPM'' Canadian Singles chart and No. 1 on the ''RPM'' Canadian Easy Listening chart.

It would replace the original album version on all subsequent pressings of the album. \"Two Doors Down\" peaked at No. 19 on the US ''Billboard'' Hot 100 and No. 12 on the US ''Billboard'' Easy Listening chart. In Canada, the single peaked at No. 26 on the ''RPM'' Canadian Singles chart and No. 7 on the ''RPM'' Canadian Easy Listening chart. \"It's All Wrong, But It's All Right\" peaked at No. 1 on both the

The material she chooses to work with, some by noted authors, others self penned, is delivered in Parton's little girl-sounding vocals. Her sweet-flowing voice becomes more and more likeable on each cut, emitting a warm innocence. The delicate string and horn accompaniment adds to the breezy, more subtle country effect. And the strong guitar work, pedal steel included, doesn't distract from Parton's vocals. Parton's title track single, which she sang on the Rock Awards television broadcast, is a sure bet to crack the Hot 100.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=Billboard Magazine - October 15, 1977 |url=https://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Billboard/70s/1977/Billboard%201977-10-15.pdf |website=American Radio History |publisher=Billboard Magazine |accessdate=7 December 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn the October 22, 1977 issue, ''[[Cashbox (magazine)|Cashbox]]'' published a review saying, \"Dolly's winning ways have convinced more than a few former non-believers that country and western audiences have no right to a monopoly on this songbird's talents. With this album, Dolly takes a giant step into the pop mainstream with a spicy repertoire that features only an occasional banjo or pedal steel lick. But even those who have seen her perform will have to be at least mildly surprised at how naturally proficient Dolly is at jumping into a completely new bag.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=Cashbox Magazine - October 22, 1977 |url=https://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive-Cash-Box/70s/1977/CB-1977-10-22.pdf |website=American Radio History |publisher=Cashbox Magazine |accessdate=7 December 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Commercial performance==\nThe album peaked at No. 1 on the US ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Top Country Albums|Hot Country LPs]] chart and No. 20 on the US [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart. In Canada, the album peaked at No. 12 on the ''[[RPM (magazine)|RPM]]'' Canadian Albums chart.\n\nThe album's first single, \"Here You Come Again\", was released in October 1977 and peaked at No. 1 on the US ''Billboard'' [[Hot Country Songs|Hot Country Singles]] chart, No. 3 on the US [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] and No. 2 on the US ''Billboard'' Easy Listening chart. In Canada, the single peaked at No. 1 on the ''RPM'' Canadian Country Singles chart, No. 7 on the ''RPM'' Canadian Singles chart and No. 1 on the ''RPM'' Canadian Easy Listening chart. In Australia, the single peaked at No. 10 on the [[ARIA Charts|ARIA]] Top 100 Singles chart. The single also peaked a No. 75 on the [[Official Charts Company|OCC]] [[UK Singles Chart]].\n\nIn February 1978, \"Two Doors Down\" and \"It's All Wrong, But It's All Right\" were issued as a double A-side single, aimed at the pop and country charts respectively. The version of \"Two Doors Down\" issued on the single was recorded by Parton in January 1978 and features a more pop sound than the album version. It would replace the original album version on all subsequent pressings of the album. \"Two Doors Down\" peaked at No. 19 on the US ''Billboard'' Hot 100 and No. 12 on the US ''Billboard'' Easy Listening chart. In Canada, the single peaked at No. 26 on the ''RPM'' Canadian Singles chart and No. 7 on the ''RPM'' Canadian Easy Listening chart. \"It's All Wrong, But It's All Right\" peaked at No. 1 on both the US ''Billboard'' Hot Country Singles chart and the ''RPM'' Canadian Country Singles chart.\n\nIn April 1980, \"Me and Little Andy\" was released as a single in the UK and it did not chart.\n\n==Track

A member of the team that developed the first [[nuclear bomb]], he later became a leader in the [[nonproliferation]] movement. He also has a place in the [[history of video games]] for his 1958 creation of ''[[Tennis for Two]]'', the first interactive analog computer game and one of the first electronic games to use a graphical display.\n\n==Early life==\nHiginbotham was born in Bridgeport, Connecticut, and grew up in Caledonia, New York. His father was a minister in the Presbyterian Church. He earned his undergraduate degree from Williams College in 1932 and continued his studies at Cornell University. He worked on the radar system at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]] from 1941 to 1943.\n\n==Career==\n[[File:Tennis For Two in 1958.jpg|thumb|right|1958 exhibit of ''Tennis for Two'']]\n\nDuring [[World War II]], he worked at [[Los Alamos National Laboratory]] and headed the lab's electronics group in the later years of the war, where his team developed electronics for the first [[nuclear bomb]].<ref name=\"NYT\">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/11/15/obituaries/william-a-higinbotham-84-helped-build-first-atomic-bomb.html|title=William A.
