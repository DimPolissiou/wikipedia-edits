The Portuguese reached this area by sea in the mid-15th century and began to dominate overseas trade.\n\nIn 1588, the claimant to the [[List of Portuguese monarchs|Portuguese throne]], [[Ant\u00f3nio, Prior of Crato]], sold exclusive trade rights on the [[Gambia River]] to English merchants. [[Letters patent]] from [[Queen Elizabeth I]] confirmed the grant. In 1618, King [[James I of England]] granted a charter to an English company for trade with the Gambia and the [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]] (now [[Ghana]]). Between 1651 and 1661, some parts of the Gambia were under the rule of the [[Duchy of Courland and Semigallia]] belonging to [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]]\u2014modern-day [[Lithuania]]\u2014and were bought by Prince [[Jacob Kettler]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Yevstratyev|first=O|date=2018|title=Chronological Dating of the Duchy of Courland's Colonial Policy|url=https://www.lvi.lu.lv/lv/LVIZ_2018_files/3_numurs/O_Yevstratyev_Chronological_LVIZ_2018_3.pdf|journal=Latvijas V\u0113stures Instit\u016bta \u017durn\u0101ls|volume=3|pages=34\u201372|access-date=22 February 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190223074148/https://www.lvi.lu.lv/lv/LVIZ_2018_files/3_numurs/O_Yevstratyev_Chronological_LVIZ_2018_3.pdf|archive-date=23 February 2019|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nDuring the late 17th century and throughout the 18th century, the [[British Empire]] and the [[French colonial empire|French Empire]] struggled continually for political and commercial supremacy in the regions of the Senegal River and the Gambia River. The British Empire occupied the Gambia when an expedition led by [[Augustus Keppel, 1st Viscount Keppel|Augustus Keppel]] landed there following the [[Capture of Senegal]] in 1758. The 1783 [[Peace of Paris (1783)|First Treaty of Versailles]] gave Great Britain possession of the Gambia River, but the French retained a tiny enclave at [[Albreda]] on the river's north bank. This was finally ceded to the United Kingdom in 1856.\n\nAs many as three million people may have been taken as [[slavery|slaves]] from this general region during the three centuries that the [[transatlantic slave trade]] operated. It is not known how many people were taken as slaves by intertribal wars or Muslim traders before the transatlantic slave trade began. Most of those taken were sold by other Africans to Europeans: some were prisoners of intertribal wars; some were victims sold because of unpaid debts, and many others were simply victims of kidnapping.<ref>Park, Mungo ''Travels in the Interior of Africa'' [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/5305 v.

The Gambia became a [[British Crown colony]] called [[Gambia Colony and Protectorate|British Gambia]], divided for administrative purposes into the colony (city of Banjul and the surrounding area) and the protectorate (remainder of the territory). The Gambia received its own executive and legislative councils in 1901, and it gradually progressed toward self-government.

Shortly thereafter, the national government held a [[1965 Gambian republic referendum|referendum]] proposing that the country become a [[republic]].

Lieutenant [[Yahya A.J.J. Jammeh]], chairman of the AFPRC, became head of state. Jammeh was just 29 years old at the time of the coup. The AFPRC announced a transition plan to return to a democratic civilian government. The Provisional Independent Electoral Commission (PIEC) was established in 1996 to conduct national elections and transformed into the Independent Electoral Commission (IEC) in 1997 and became responsible for the registration of voters and for the conduct of elections and referendums.\n\nIn late 2001 and early 2002, The Gambia completed a full cycle of [[Gambian presidential election, 2001|presidential]], [[Gambian parliamentary election, 2002|legislative]], and local elections, which foreign observers{{Who|date=March 2016}} deemed free, fair, and transparent.

From 1965 to 1994, the country was ostensibly a multi-party [[liberal democracy]]. It was ruled by [[Dawda Jawara]] and his [[People's Progressive Party (Gambia)|People's Progressive Party]] (PPP). However, the country never experienced political turnover during this period and its commitment to succession by the ballot box was never tested.<ref>Edie, p. 162</ref> In 1994, a [[1994 Gambian coup d'\u00e9tat|military coup]] propelled a commission of military officers to power, known as the [[Armed Forces Provisional Ruling Council]] (AFPRC). After two years of direct rule, a new constitution was written and in 1996, the leader of the AFPRC, [[Yahya Jammeh]], was elected as President. He ruled in an authoritarian style until the [[Gambian presidential election, 2016|2016 election]], which was won by [[Adama Barrow]], backed by a coalition of opposition parties.\n\n=== Political history ===\nDuring the Jawara era, there were initially four political parties, the PPP, the [[United Party (Gambia)|United Party]] (UP), the [[Democratic Party (Gambia)|Democratic Party]] (DP), and the [[Muslim Congress Party]] (MCP). The 1960 constitution had established a [[House of Representatives of the Gambia|House of Representatives]], and in the [[Gambian legislative election, 1960|1960 election]] no party won a majority of seats. However, in 1961 the British Governor chose UP leader [[Pierre Sarr N'Jie]] to serve as the country's first head of government, in the form of a Chief Minister. This was an unpopular decision, and the [[Gambian legislative election, 1962|1962 election]] was notable as parties were able to appeal to ethnic and religious differences across The Gambia. The PPP won a majority, and formed a coalition with the [[Democratic Congress Alliance]] (DCA; a merger of the DP and MCP). They invited the UP to the coalition in 1963, but it left in 1965.<ref name=\":0\">Edie, pp. 162\u2013164</ref>\n\nThe UP was seen as the main opposition party, but it lost power from 1965 to 1970. In 1975, the [[National Convention Party (Gambia)|National Convention Party]] (NCP) was formed by [[Sheriff Mustapha Dibba]], and became the new main opposition party to the PPP's dominance.<ref name=\":0\" /> Both the PPP and NCP were ideologically similar, so in the 1980s a new opposition party emerged, in the form of the radical socialist [[People's Democratic Organisation for Independence and Socialism]] (PDOIS). However, between the 1966 and 1992 elections, the PPP was \"overwhelmingly dominant\", winning between 55% and 70% of the vote in each election and a large majority of seats continually.<ref>Edie, p. 165</ref>\n\nIn principle, competitive politics existed during the Jawara era, however, it was stated that there was in reality a \"one-party monopoly of state power centred around the dominant personality of Dawda Jawara.\" Civil society was limited post-independence, and opposition parties were weak and at the risk of being declared subversive. The opposition did not have equal access to resources, as the business class refused to finance them. The government had control over when they could make public announcements and press briefings, and there were also allegations of [[Electoral fraud|vote-buying]] and improprieties in the preparation of the [[Electoral roll|electoral register]]. A 1991 court challenge by the PDOIS against irregularities on the electoral register in Banjul was dismissed on a technicality.<ref>Edie, pp. 168\u2013170</ref>\n\nIn July 1994, a [[1994 Gambian coup d'\u00e9tat|bloodless military coup d'\u00e9tat]] brought an end to the Jawara era. The [[Armed Forces Provisional Ruling Council]] (AFPRC), led by [[Yahya Jammeh]], ruled dictatorially for two years. The council suspended the constitution, banned all political parties, and imposed a dusk-to-dawn curfew on the populace.<ref>Edie, p. 182</ref> A transition back to democracy occurred in 1996, and a new constitution was written, though the process was manipulated to benefit Jammeh.<ref name=\"Edie, p. 185\">Edie, p. 185</ref> In a 1996 referendum, 70% of voters approved the constitution, and in December 1996 Jammeh was elected as President. All but PDOIS of the pre-coup parties were banned, and former ministers were barred from public office.<ref>Edie, p. 186</ref>\n\nDuring Jammeh's rule, the opposition was again fragmented. An example was the infighting between members of the [[National Alliance for Democracy and Development]] (NADD) that was formed in 2005. Jammeh used the police forces to harass opposition members and parties. Jammeh was also accused of human rights abuses, especially towards human rights activists, civil society organisations, political opponents, and the media. Their fates included being sent into exile, harassment, arbitrary imprisonment, murder, and forced disappearance. Particular examples include the murder of journalist [[Deyda Hydara]] in 2004, a [[April 2000 Gambian student massacre|student massacre at a protest]] in 2000, public threats to kill human rights defenders in 2009, and public threats towards homosexuals in 2013. Furthermore, Jammeh made threats to the religious freedom of non-Muslims, used 'mercenary judges' to weaken the judiciary, and faced numerous accusations of election rigging.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=http://cddwestafrica.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/democratictransitioninthegambia.pdf|title=Democratic Transition in the Gambia: The Burden of Leadership and Consolidation|date=2017|website=Centre for Democracy and Development|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180615004701/http://cddwestafrica.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/democratictransitioninthegambia.pdf|archive-date=15 June 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn the [[Gambian presidential election, 2016|December 2016 presidential election]], Jammeh was beaten by [[Adama Barrow]], who was backed by a [[Coalition 2016|coalition of opposition parties]]. Jammeh's initial agreement to step down followed by a change of mind induced a [[2016\u201317 Gambian constitutional crisis|constitutional crisis]] that culminated in a [[ECOWAS military intervention in the Gambia|military intervention by ECOWAS forces]] in January 2017. Barrow pledged to serve at the head of a three-year transitional government.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/601994/Gambia_-_Pol_Opn_-_CPIN_-_v2_0.pdf|title=Gambia: Political opinion|date=March 2017|website=Home Office|page=14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180615033526/https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/601994/Gambia_-_Pol_Opn_-_CPIN_-_v2_0.pdf|archive-date=15 June 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The Nigerian [[Centre for Democracy and Development]] describe the challenges facing Barrow as needing to restore \"citizen's trust and confidence in the public sector\". They describe a \"fragile peace\" with tensions in rural areas between farmers and the larger communities. They also reported on tensions between ethnic groups developing. An example is that in February 2017, 51 supporters of Jammeh were arrested for harassing supporters of Barrow. Although his election was initially met with enthusiasm, the Centre notes that this has been dampened by Barrow's initial constitutional faux pas with his Vice President, the challenge of inclusion, and high expectations post-Jammeh.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Constitution ===\nThe Gambia has had a number of constitutions in its history. The two most significant are the 1970 constitution, which established The Gambia as a presidential republic, and the 1996 constitution, which served as a basis for Jammeh's rule and was kept following Barrow's victory in 2016. Jammeh manipulated the 1996 constitutional reform process to benefit himself. No reference was made to term limits, indicating Jammeh's preference to stay in power for an extended period of time.<ref name=\"Edie, p. 185\"/> According to the 1996 constitution, the President is the head of state, head of government, and commander-in-chief of the armed forces.

In terms of the civil service, they can appoint the Public Service Commission, the ombudsman, and the Independent Electoral Commission. The president is directly elected for five-year terms based on a simple majority of votes.

It maintained close relations with the United Kingdom, Senegal, and other African countries. The July 1994 coup strained The Gambia's relationship with Western powers, particularly the United States, which until 2002 suspended most non-humanitarian assistance in accordance with Section 508 of the [[Foreign Assistance Act]]. After 1995 President Jammeh established diplomatic relations with several additional countries, including [[Libya]] (suspended in 2010), and [[Cuba]].<ref name=\"bn\">[https://2009-2017.state.gov/r/pa/ei/bgn/5459.htm \"Background note: The Gambia\"] .

It originally consisted of the Gambia National Army (GNA), trained by the British, and Gambia National Gendarmerie (GNG), trained by the Senegalese. The GNG was merged into the police in 1992, and in 1997 Jammeh created a Gambia Navy (GN). Attempts to create a [[Gambian Air Force|Gambia Air Force]] in the mid 2000s ultimately fell through. In 2008, Jammeh created a National Republican Guard, composed of special forces units. The GNA has a strength of roughly 900, in two infantry battalions and an engineering company. It makes use of [[Ferret armoured car|Ferret]] and [[M8 Greyhound]] armoured cars. The GN is equipped with patrol vessels, and [[Taiwan]] donated a number of new vessels to the force in 2013.\n\nSince the GAF was formed in 1985, it has been active in UN and [[African Union]] peacekeeping missions. It has been classed as a Tier 2 peacekeeping contributor<ref name=\"BellamyWilliams\">Bellamy, Alex J. and Williams, Paul D.

It has since contributed troops to [[ECOMIL]], [[United Nations Mission in Liberia|UNMIL]], and [[United Nations\u2013African Union Mission in Darfur|UNAMID]]. Responsibility for the military has rested directly with the President since Jammeh seized power at the head of a [[1994 Gambian coup d'\u00e9tat|bloodless military coup in 1994]]. Jammeh also created the role of [[Chief of the Defence Staff (The Gambia)|Chief of the Defence Staff]], who is the senior military officer responsible for the day-to-day operations of the Gambia Armed Forces. Between 1958 and 1985, the Gambia did not have a military, but the Gambia Field Force existed as a paramilitary wing of the police. The military tradition of the Gambia can be traced to the [[Gambia Regiment]] of the [[British Army]], that existed from 1901 to 1958 and fought in [[World War I]] and [[World War II]]. In 2017, Gambia signed the UN treaty on the [[Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons|Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&mtdsg_no=XXVI-9&chapter=26&clang=_en |title=Chapter XXVI: Disarmament&nbsp;\u2013 No. 9 Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons |publisher=United Nations Treaty Collection |date=7 July 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe Gambia Armed Forces is and has been the recipient of a number of equipment and training agreements with other countries. In 1992, a contingent of Nigerian soldiers helped lead the GNA. Between 1991 and 2005, the Turkish armed forces helped train Gambian soldiers.

However, smaller Christian groups are present, such as [[Anglicanism|Anglicans]], [[Methodism|Methodists]], [[Baptists]], [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventists]], [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], and small evangelical denominations.<ref name=\"irfr07\"/>\n\nIt is unclear to what extent [[Traditional African religion|indigenous]] beliefs, such as the [[Serer religion]], continue to be practiced. Serer religion encompasses cosmology and a belief in a supreme deity called [[Roog]]. Some of its religious festivals include the ''[[Xooy]]'', ''Mbosseh'', and ''Randou Rande''. Each year, adherents to Serer religion make the annual pilgrimage to [[Kingdom of Sine|Sine]] in Senegal for the ''Xooy'' divination ceremony.<ref>Kalis, Simone (1997).

The national borders outline a narrow strip on either side of the River Gambia, a body of water that has played a vital part in the nation's destiny and is known locally simply as \"the River\". Without natural barriers, the Gambia has become home to most of the ethnic groups that are present throughout western Africa, especially those in Senegal.\n\nEuropeans also figure prominently in Gambian history because the River Gambia is navigable deep into the continent, a geographic feature that made this area one of the most profitable sites for the slave trade from the 15th through the 17th centuries. (It also made it strategic to the halt of this trade once it was outlawed in the 19th century.) Some of this history was popularised in the [[Alex Haley]] book and TV series ''[[Roots: The Saga of an American Family|Roots]]'', which was set in the Gambia.\n\n===Music===\n\n{{Further|Music of the Gambia}}\n\nThe music of the Gambia is closely linked musically with [[Music of Senegal|that of its neighbour, Senegal]], which surrounds its inland frontiers completely. It fuses popular Western music and dance, with ''[[sabar]]'', the traditional drumming and dance music of the [[Wolof people|Wolof]] and [[Serer people]].\n\n===Cuisine===\n\n{{Main|Gambian cuisine}}\n\nThe cuisine of the Gambia includes peanuts, rice, fish, meat, onions, tomatoes, cassava, chili peppers and oysters from the River Gambia that are harvested by women. In particular, [[Yassa (food)|yassa]] and [[domoda]] curries<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gambia.co.uk/blog/traditional-gambian-food-and-drink|title=Traditional food and drink in The Gambia|website=www.gambia.co.uk|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-02-20|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180221095929/https://www.gambia.co.uk/blog/traditional-gambian-food-and-drink|archive-date=21 February 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> are popular with locals and tourists.\n\n===Media===\n\nCritics have accused the government of restricting free speech.

The Gambia won two CAF U-17 championships one in 2005 when the country hosted, and 2009 in Algeria automatically qualifying for FIFA U-17 World Cup in Peru (2005) and Nigeria (2009) respectively. The U-20 also qualified for FIFA U-20 2007 in Canada.

The British Empire occupied the Gambia when an expedition led by [[Augustus Keppel, 1st Viscount Keppel|Augustus Keppel]] landed there following the [[Capture of Senegal]] in 1758. The 1783 [[Peace of Paris (1783)|First Treaty of Versailles]] gave Great Britain possession of the Gambia River, but the French retained a tiny enclave at [[Albreda]] on the river's north bank. This was finally ceded to the United Kingdom in 1856.\n\nAs many as three million people may have been taken as [[slavery|slaves]] from this general region during the three centuries that the [[transatlantic slave trade]] operated. It is not known how many people were taken as slaves by intertribal wars or Muslim traders before the transatlantic slave trade began. Most of those taken were sold by other Africans to Europeans: some were prisoners of intertribal wars; some were victims sold because of unpaid debts; and many others were simply victims of kidnapping.<ref>Park, Mungo ''Travels in the Interior of Africa'' [http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/5305 v.

From 1965 to 1994, the country was ostensibly a multi-party [[liberal democracy]]. It was ruled by [[Dawda Jawara]] and his [[People's Progressive Party (Gambia)|People's Progressive Party]] (PPP). However, the country never experienced political turnover during this period and its commitment to succession by the ballot box was never tested.<ref>Edie, p. 162</ref> In 1994, a [[1994 Gambian coup d'\u00e9tat|military coup]] propelled a commission of military officers to power, known as the [[Armed Forces Provisional Ruling Council]] (AFPRC). After two years of direct rule, a new constitution was written and in 1996, the leader of the AFPRC, [[Yahya Jammeh]], was elected as President. He ruled in an authoritarian style until the [[Gambian presidential election, 2016|2016 election]], which was won by [[Adama Barrow]], backed by a coalition of opposition parties.\n\n=== Political history ===\nDuring the Jawara era, there were initially four political parties, the PPP, the [[United Party (Gambia)|United Party]] (UP), the [[Democratic Party (Gambia)|Democratic Party]] (DP), and the [[Muslim Congress Party]] (MCP). The 1960 constitution had established a [[House of Representatives of the Gambia|House of Representatives]], and in the [[Gambian legislative election, 1960|1960 election]] no party won a majority of seats. However, in 1961 the British Governor chose UP leader [[Pierre Sarr N'Jie]] to serve as the country's first head of government, in the form of a Chief Minister. This was an unpopular decision, and the [[Gambian legislative election, 1962|1962 election]] was notable as parties were able to appeal to ethnic and religious differences across The Gambia. The PPP won a majority, and formed a coalition with the [[Democratic Congress Alliance]] (DCA; a merger of the DP and MCP). They invited the UP to the coalition in 1963, but it left in 1965.<ref name=\":0\">Edie, pp. 162\u2013164</ref>\n\nThe UP was seen as the main opposition party, but it lost power from 1965 to 1970. In 1975, the [[National Convention Party (Gambia)|National Convention Party]] (NCP) was formed by [[Sheriff Mustapha Dibba]], and became the new main opposition party to the PPP's dominance.<ref name=\":0\" /> Both the PPP and NCP were ideologically similar, so in the 1980s a new opposition party emerged, in the form of the radical socialist [[People's Democratic Organisation for Independence and Socialism]] (PDOIS). However, between the 1966 and 1992 elections, the PPP was \"overwhelmingly dominant\", winning between 55% and 70% of the vote in each election and a large majority of seats continually.<ref>Edie, p. 165</ref>\n\nIn principle, competitive politics existed during the Jawara era, however, it was stated that there was in reality a \"one-party monopoly of state power centred around the dominant personality of Dawda Jawara.\" Civil society was limited post-independence, and opposition parties were weak and at the risk of being declared subversive. The opposition did not have equal access to resources, as the business class refused to finance them. The government had control over when they could make public announcements and press briefings, and there were also allegations of [[Electoral fraud|vote-buying]] and improprieties in the preparation of the [[Electoral roll|electoral register]]. A 1991 court challenge by the PDOIS against irregularities on the electoral register in Banjul was dismissed on a technicality.<ref>Edie, pp. 168\u2013170</ref>\n\nIn July 1994, a [[1994 Gambian coup d'\u00e9tat|bloodless military coup d'\u00e9tat]] brought an end to the Jawara era. The [[Armed Forces Provisional Ruling Council]] (AFPRC), led by [[Yahya Jammeh]], ruled dictatorially for two years. The council suspended the constitution, banned all political parties, and imposed a dusk-to-dawn curfew on the populace.<ref>Edie, p. 182</ref> A transition back to democracy occurred in 1996, and a new constitution was written, though the process was manipulated to benefit Jammeh.<ref name=\"Edie, p. 185\">Edie, p. 185</ref> In a 1996 referendum, 70% of voters approved the constitution, and in December 1996 Jammeh was elected as President. All but PDOIS of the pre-coup parties were banned, and former ministers were barred from public office.<ref>Edie, p. 186</ref>\n\nDuring Jammeh's rule, the opposition was again fragmented. An example was the infighting between members of the [[National Alliance for Democracy and Development]] (NADD) that was formed in 2005. Jammeh used the police forces to harass opposition members and parties. Jammeh was also accused of human rights abuses, especially towards human rights activists, civil society organisations, political opponents, and the media.

They describe a \"fragile peace\" with tensions in rural areas between farmers and the larger communities. They also reported on tensions between ethnic groups developing. An example is that in February 2017, 51 supporters of Jammeh were arrested for harassing supporters of Barrow. Although his election was initially met with enthusiasm, the Centre notes that this has been dampened by Barrow's initial constitutional faux pas with his Vice President, the challenge of inclusion, and high expectations post-Jammeh.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Constitution ===\nThe Gambia has had a number of constitutions in its history. The two most significant are the 1970 constitution, which established The Gambia as a presidential republic, and the 1996 constitution, which served as a basis for Jammeh's rule and was kept following Barrow's victory in 2016. Jammeh manipulated the 1996 constitutional reform process to benefit himself. No reference was made to term limits, indicating Jammeh's preference to stay in power for an extended period of time.<ref name=\"Edie, p. 185\"/> According to the 1996 constitution, the President is the head of state, head of government, and commander-in-chief of the armed forces.

The office of Prime Minister was abolished in 1970. Total executive power is vested in the president. They can also appoint five members of the National Assembly, the judges of the superior courts, regional governors, and district chiefs. In terms of the civil service, they can appoint the Public Service Commission, the ombudsman, and the Independent Electoral Commission. The president is directly elected for five-year terms based on a simple majority of votes.

It maintained close relations with the United Kingdom, Senegal, and other African countries. The July 1994 coup strained The Gambia's relationship with Western powers, particularly the United States, which until 2002 suspended most non-humanitarian assistance in accordance with Section 508 of the [[Foreign Assistance Act]].

It originally consisted of the Gambia National Army (GNA), trained by the British, and Gambia National Gendarmerie (GNG), trained by the Senegalese. The GNG was merged into the police in 1992, and in 1997 Jammeh created a Gambia Navy (GN). Attempts to create a [[Gambian Air Force|Gambia Air Force]] in the mid 2000s ultimately fell through. In 2008, Jammeh created a National Republican Guard, composed of special forces units. The GNA has a strength of roughly 900, in two infantry battalions and an engineering company. It makes use of [[Ferret armoured car|Ferret]] and [[M8 Greyhound]] armoured cars. The GN is equipped with patrol vessels, and [[Taiwan]] donated a number of new vessels to the force in 2013.\n\nSince the GAF was formed in 1985, it has been active in UN and [[African Union]] peacekeeping missions. It has been classed as a Tier 2 peacekeeping contributor<ref name=\"BellamyWilliams\">Bellamy, Alex J. and Williams, Paul D.

It has since contributed troops to [[ECOMIL]], [[United Nations Mission in Liberia|UNMIL]], and [[United Nations\u2013African Union Mission in Darfur|UNAMID]]. Responsibility for the military has rested directly with the President since Jammeh seized power at the head of a [[1994 Gambian coup d'\u00e9tat|bloodless military coup in 1994]]. Jammeh also created the role of [[Chief of the Defence Staff (The Gambia)|Chief of the Defence Staff]], who is the senior military officer responsible for the day-to-day operations of the Gambia Armed Forces. Between 1958 and 1985, the Gambia did not have a military, but the Gambia Field Force existed as a paramilitary wing of the police. The military tradition of the Gambia can be traced to the [[Gambia Regiment]] of the [[British Army]], that existed from 1901 to 1958 and fought in [[World War I]] and [[World War II]]. In 2017, Gambia signed the UN treaty on the [[Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons|Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&mtdsg_no=XXVI-9&chapter=26&clang=_en |title=Chapter XXVI: Disarmament&nbsp;\u2013 No. 9 Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons |publisher=United Nations Treaty Collection |date=7 July 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe Gambia Armed Forces is and has been the recipient of a number of equipment and training agreements with other countries. In 1992, a contingent of Nigerian soldiers helped lead the GNA. Between 1991 and 2005, the Turkish armed forces helped train Gambian soldiers.

The national borders outline a narrow strip on either side of the River Gambia, a body of water that has played a vital part in the nation's destiny and is known locally simply as \"the River\". Without natural barriers, the Gambia has become home to most of the ethnic groups that are present throughout western Africa, especially those in Senegal.\n\nEuropeans also figure prominently in Gambian history because the River Gambia is navigable deep into the continent, a geographic feature that made this area one of the most profitable sites for the slave trade from the 15th through the 17th centuries. (It also made it strategic to the halt of this trade once it was outlawed in the 19th century.) Some of this history was popularised in the [[Alex Haley]] book and TV series ''[[Roots: The Saga of an American Family|Roots]]'', which was set in the Gambia.\n\n===Music===\n\n{{Further|Music of the Gambia}}\n\nThe music of the Gambia is closely linked musically with [[Music of Senegal|that of its neighbour, Senegal]], which surrounds its inland frontiers completely.

Cannell]] and [[Patrick Hasburgh]], the film follows two police officers who are forced to relive high school when they are assigned to go undercover as high school students to prevent the outbreak of a new synthetic drug and arrest its supplier.\n\nThe film was released theatrically on March 16, 2012 by [[Columbia Pictures]] and [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]],<ref name=\"mgm\" /> and grossed $201 million against a budget of $54.7 million. A sequel, titled ''[[22 Jump Street]]'', was released on June 13, 2014. A female-led spin-off is currently in development.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the plot summary should be 400-700 words. -->\nIn 2005, scholarly student Morton Schmidt and popular underachieving jock Greg Jenko miss their school prom; Schmidt being rejected by the girl he asked to be his date and Jenko being barred from attending due to failing grades. Seven years later, the duo meets again at the Police Academy and become friends and partners on bicycle patrol. They catch a break when they arrest Domingo, the leader of a [[Outlaw motorcycle club|one-percenter]] motorcycle gang, but are forced to release him after they failed to read him his [[Miranda warning|''Miranda'' rights]].\n\nThe duo are reassigned to a revived scheme from the 1980s, which specializes in infiltrating high schools. Captain Dickson assigns them to contain the spread of a synthetic drug called HFS (\"Holy Fucking Shit\") at Sagan High School. He gives them new identities and enrolls them as students, giving them class schedules fitting their previous academic performances; Jenko taking mostly arts and humanities, and Schmidt taking mostly science classes, but the duo mixes up their identities. Schmidt gets a lead on HFS from classmate Molly, and he and Jenko meet the school's main dealer, popular student Eric. The two take HFS in front of him to maintain their cover. After experiencing the drug's effects, the duo discovers that Schmidt's intelligence now makes him popular, while Jenko's lax attitude is frowned upon.\n\nEric takes a liking to Schmidt, who develops a romantic interest in Molly. Jenko becomes friends with the students in his [[AP Chemistry]] class and finds himself becoming more interested in geeky hobbies and academic pursuits. Schmidt and Jenko throw a party at Schmidt's parents' house, where they are living during the course of their assignment, and invite Eric. During the party, a fight breaks out between Schmidt, Jenko, and some party crashers. Schmidt wins the fight, solidifying his social status and gaining Eric's trust. Jenko's friends hack Eric's phone to enable them to listen in on his conversations.\n\nAt a party at Eric's house, using the phone hack, Jenko and his friends overhear information about an upcoming meeting between Eric and his supplier, but also catch Schmidt making disparaging comments about Jenko. The rift between the duo grows as their new school life intrudes upon their official police work. Schmidt and Jenko track Eric to a cash transaction with the distributors of HFS \u2013 the motorcycle gang from the park \u2013 and a chase ensues on the freeway. They return to school, argue, and eventually begin fighting, which disrupts the school play. They are expelled from school and fired from the Jump Street program.\n\nEric, stressed and terrified, recruits Schmidt and Jenko as security for a deal taking place at the school prom. While dressing for the prom, Schmidt and Jenko rekindle their friendship. At the prom, they discover that the supplier is the physical education teacher, Mr. Walters, who created the drug accidentally and started selling it to the students to supplement his teacher's salary. Having caught Eric smoking marijuana, he was able to persuade him into being his dealer.\n\nThe motorcycle gang arrives for the deal but Molly interrupts them and starts arguing with Schmidt. As a result, gang leader Domingo recognizes Schmidt and Jenko, and orders his men to kill them. Two of the gang members reveal themselves as undercover [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] agents Tom Hanson and Doug Penhall, and former members of the [[21 Jump Street]] program. In the ensuing gunfight, Hanson and Penhall are fatally wounded. Mr. Walters and Eric escape with the money and Molly as a hostage; the gang, Schmidt, and Jenko follow close behind. Jenko creates a homemade bomb and uses it to kill the gang. Mr. Walters shoots at Schmidt but Jenko takes the bullet to his arm, sparing Schmidt's life. In response, Schmidt shoots Mr. Walters, unintentionally severing his penis. As they arrest Mr. Walters and Eric in addition to successfully reading the former his Miranda rights, Schmidt and Jenko reconcile their relationship. Schmidt and Molly share a kiss.\n\nBoth officers are congratulated and reinstated in the Jump Street program as Dickson gives them a new assignment: infiltrating a college.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Jonah Hill]] as Officer Morton Schmidt, a socially awkward yet smart police officer.\n* [[Channing Tatum]] as Officer Greg Jenko, a slow-witted yet handsome cop.\n* [[Brie Larson]] as Molly Tracey, one of Eric's friends and Schmidt's love interest.\n* [[Dave Franco]] as Eric Molson, a student who is one of the H.F.S. dealers.\n* [[Rob Riggle]] as Mr. Walters, a physical education teacher.\n* [[DeRay Davis]] as Domingo, the leader of the One-Percenters.\n* [[Ice Cube]] as Captain Dickson, a coarse police captain who manages 21 Jump Street.\n* [[Chris Parnell]] as Mr. Gordon, a drama teacher.\n* [[Ellie Kemper]] as Ms. Griggs, a science teacher who has a sexual interest towards Jenko and doesn't know he is a cop.\n* [[Jake Johnson]] as Principal Dadier, the principal of Sagan High.\n* [[Nick Offerman]] as Deputy Chief Hardy.\n* [[Holly Robinson Peete]] as Officer Judy Hoffs.\n* [[Lindsey Broad]] as Lisa.\n* [[Johnny Simmons]] as Billiam Willing-ham, a Sagan High student who died due to H.F.S.\n* [[Spencer Boldman]] as French Samuels\n* [[Rye Rye]] as Jr. Jr.\n* [[Caroline Aaron]] as Annie Schmidt\n* [[Joe Chrest]] as David Schmidt\n* [[Dakota Johnson]] as Fugazy\n* [[Valerie Tian]] as Burns\n* [[Luis Da Silva]] as Luis\n* [[Johnny Depp]] (uncredited [[Cameo appearance|cameo]]) as Tom Hanson<ref name=\"johnny-cameo\">{{cite web|last1=Weinstein|first1=Joshua|title=Johnny Depp '21 Jump Street' Cameo Came With Conditions (Spoiler Alert)|url=https://www.thewrap.com/movies/column-post/johnny-depp-21-jump-street-cameo-came-condition-36376/|publisher=The Wrap|accessdate=5 October 2014}}</ref>\n* [[Peter DeLuise]] (uncredited cameo) as Doug Penhall<ref name=\"johnny-cameo\" />\n{{div col end}}\n\n==Production==\nIn May 2008, [[Sony Pictures]] confirmed that a [[film adaptation]] of the series was under development.

Cannell]] and [[Patrick Hasburgh]], the film follows two police officers who are forced to relive high school when they are assigned to go undercover as high school students to prevent the outbreak of a new synthetic drug and arrest its supplier.\n\nThe film was released theatrically on March 16, 2012 by [[Columbia Pictures]] and [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]],<ref name=\"mgm\" /> and grossed $201 million against a budget of $54.7 million. A sequel, titled ''[[22 Jump Street]]'', was released on June 13, 2014. A female-led spin-off is currently in development.\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, the plot summary should be 400-700 words. -->\nIn 2005, scholarly student Morton Schmidt and popular underachieving jock Greg Jenko miss their school prom; Schmidt being rejected by the girl he asked to be his date and Jenko being barred from attending due to failing grades. Seven years later, the duo meets again at the Police Academy and become friends and partners on bicycle patrol. They catch a break when they arrest Domingo, the leader of a [[Outlaw motorcycle club|one-percenter]] motorcycle gang, but are forced to release him after they failed to read him his [[Miranda warning|''Miranda'' rights]].\n\nThe duo are reassigned to a revived scheme from the 1980s, which specializes in infiltrating high schools. Captain Dickson assigns them to contain the spread of a synthetic drug called HFS (\"Holy Fucking Shit\") at Sagan High School. He gives them new identities and enrolls them as students, giving them class schedules fitting their previous academic performances; Jenko taking mostly arts and humanities, and Schmidt taking mostly science classes, but the duo mixes up their identities. Schmidt gets a lead on HFS from classmate Molly, and he and Jenko meet the school's main dealer, popular student Eric. The two take HFS in front of him to maintain their cover. After experiencing the drug's effects, the duo discovers that Schmidt's intelligence now makes him popular, while Jenko's lax attitude is frowned upon.\n\nEric takes a liking to Schmidt, who develops a romantic interest in Molly. Jenko becomes friends with the students in his [[AP Chemistry]] class and finds himself becoming more interested in geeky hobbies and academic pursuits. Schmidt and Jenko throw a party at Schmidt's parents' house, where they are living during the course of their assignment, and invite Eric. During the party, a fight breaks out between Schmidt, Jenko, and some party crashers. Schmidt wins the fight, solidifying his social status and gaining Eric's trust. Jenko's friends hack Eric's phone to enable them to listen in on his conversations.\n\nAt a party at Eric's house, using the phone hack, Jenko and his friends overhear information about an upcoming meeting between Eric and his supplier, but also catch Schmidt making disparaging comments about Jenko. The rift between the duo grows as their new school life intrudes upon their official police work. Schmidt and Jenko track Eric to a cash transaction with the distributors of HFS \u2013 the motorcycle gang from the park \u2013 and a chase ensues on the freeway. They return to school, argue, and eventually begin fighting, which disrupts the school play. They are expelled from school and fired from the Jump Street program.\n\nEric, stressed and terrified, recruits Schmidt and Jenko as security for a deal taking place at the school prom. While dressing for the prom, Schmidt and Jenko rekindle their friendship. At the prom, they discover that the supplier is the physical education teacher, Mr. Walters, who created the drug accidentally and started selling it to the students to supplement his teacher's salary. Having caught Eric smoking marijuana, he was able to persuade him into being his dealer.\n\nThe motorcycle gang arrives for the deal but Molly interrupts them and starts arguing with Schmidt. As a result, gang leader Domingo recognizes Schmidt and Jenko, and orders his men to kill them. Two of the gang members reveal themselves as undercover [[Drug Enforcement Administration|DEA]] agents Tom Hanson and Doug Penhall, and former members of the [[21 Jump Street]] program. In the ensuing gunfight, Hanson and Penhall are fatally wounded. Mr. Walters and Eric escape with the money and Molly as a hostage; the gang, Schmidt, and Jenko follow close behind. Jenko creates a homemade bomb and uses it to kill the gang. Mr. Walters shoots at Schmidt but Jenko takes the bullet to his arm, sparing Schmidt's life.

Also, some Sunni-accepted hadith are less favored by Shias; one example is that because of Aisha's opposition to Ali, hadiths narrated by Aisha are not given the same authority as those by other companions. Another example is hadith narrated by [[Abu Hurairah#Shi'a view|Abu Hurairah]], who is considered by Shias as the enemy of Ali. The Shia argument is that Abu Hurairah was only a Muslim four years of his life before Muhammad's death.

Nevertheless, apart from this domination there existed, firstly, throughout these nine centuries, Shia inclinations among many Sunnis of this land and, secondly, Twelver and Zaidi Shiism had prevalence in some parts of Iran. During this period, the Shia in Iran were nourished from [[Kufa]], [[Baghdad]] and later from [[Najaf]] and [[Al Hillah]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.al-islam.org/mot/iraqishiism/|title=Four Centuries of Influence of Iraqi Shiism on Pre-Safavid Iran|work=Al-Islam.org}}</ref> Shia were dominant in Tabaristan, [[Qom]], [[Kashan]], [[Avaj]] and [[Sabzevar]].

This spread of Shiism to the inner circles of the government enabled the Shia to withstand those who opposed them by relying upon the power of the caliphate.\n\nTwelvers came to Iran from Arab regions in the course of four stages. First, through the [[Asharis tribe]]{{Clarify|date=August 2013}} at the end of the 7th and during the 8th century. Second through the pupils of Sabzevar, and especially those of [[Al-Shaykh Al-Mufid]], who were from [[Rey, Iran|Rey]] and [[Sabzawar]] and resided in those cities. Third, through the school of Hillah under the leadership of [[Al-Hilli]] and his son [[Fakhr al-Muhaqqiqin]]. Fourth, through the scholars of [[Jabal Amel]] residing in that region, or in Iraq, during the 16th and 17th centuries who later migrated to Iran.<ref name=\"Jafarian2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.imamreza.net/eng/imamreza.php?print=589|title=A Study of the Migration of Shi'i Works from Arab Regions to Iran at the Early Safavid Era. -- Imam Reza (A.S.)

[[Hassan-i Sabbah]] conquered fortresses and captured [[Alamut]] in 1090. Nizaris used this fortress until the [[Mongols]] finally seized and destroyed it in 1256.\n\nAfter the Mongols and the fall of the Abbasids, the Sunni [[Ulama]] suffered greatly. In addition to the destruction of the caliphate there was no official Sunni school of law. Many libraries and madrasahs were destroyed and Sunni scholars migrated to other Islamic areas such as [[Anatolia]] and Egypt. In contrast, most Shia were largely unaffected as their center was not in Iran at this time. For the first time, the Shia could openly convert other Muslims to their movement.\n\nSeveral local Shia dynasties like the [[Marashi]] and Sarbadars were established during this time.

This campaign forced most the Shiites to disperse, with some fleeing south to Jabal Amel and some to the Bekaa, while a very small portion of them took on the practice of Taqiyya until the Ottomans came in 1517. Many Shias in the Levant were killed for their faith.

According to scholar [[Vali Nasr]], as the Muslim world was decolonialised and [[Arab nationalism]] lost its appeal, fundamentalism blossomed and reasserted the differences and conflicts between the two movements, particularly in the strict teachings of Sunni scholar [[Ibn Taymiyyah]].<ref name=nasr-2006-106>Nasr, Vali, ''The Shia Revival'', Norton, 2006, pp. 106\u201307</ref> The Iranian Islamic revolution changed the Shia\u2013Sunni power equation in Muslim countries \"from Lebanon to India\" arousing the traditionally subservient Shia to the alarm of traditionally dominant and very non-revolutionary Sunni.<ref name=nasr-2006-148>Nasr, Vali, ''The Shia Revival'', Norton, (2006), pp. 148\u201350</ref> \"Where Iranian revolutionaries saw Islamic revolutionary stirrings, Sunnis saw mostly Shia mischief and a threat to Sunni predominance.\"<ref>Nasr, Vali, ''The Shia Revival'', Norton, (2006), pp. 143\u201344</ref>\n\nAlthough the Iranian revolution's leader, [[Ayatollah Khomeini]], was very much in favor of Shia\u2013Sunni unity, he also challenged Saudi Arabia, in his view an \"unpopular and corrupt dictatorship\" and an \"American lackey\" ripe for revolution. In part because Saudi Arabia was the world's major international [[Islamism#Saudi Arabian funding|funder]] of Islamic schools, scholarships, and fellowships, this angered not only Saudi Arabia but its many fundamentalist allies and benefactors throughout the Arab world, according to Nasr.<ref name=\"Nasr, Vali 2006 p.143-4\">Nasr, Vali, ''The Shia Revival,'' Norton, (2006), pp. 143\u201344, 147\u201348, 150\u201351</ref>\n\nAnother effect noted by political scientist [[Gilles Kepel]], is that the initial attraction of the [[Islamic Revolution]] to Sunnis as well as Shia, and Khomeini's desire to export his revolution, motivated the Saudi establishment to shore up its \"religious legitimacy\" with more strictness in religion (and with jihad in Afghanistan) to compete with Iran's revolutionary ideology.<ref name=GKJTPI2002:137>[[#GKJTPI2002|Kepel, ''Jihad'', 2002]]: p. 137</ref> But doing so in Saudi meant a more anti-Shia policies because Saudi's own native Sunni school of Islam is [[Wahhabism]], which includes the prohibition of Shia Islam itself, as strict Wahhabis do not consider Shia to be Islamic. This new strictness was spread not only among Saudis in the kingdom but thousands of students and Saudi funded schools and international Islamist volunteers who came to training camps in Peshawar Pakistan in the 1980s to learn to fight jihad in Afghanistan and went home in the 1990s to fight jihad.

Ali Bhutto was Shia, Zia ul-Haq a Sunni.<ref>Nasr, Vali, ''The Shia Revival'', Norton, (2006), p. 89</ref>\n\n[[Zia-ul-Haq's Islamization]] that followed was resisted by Shia who saw it as \"Sunnification\" as the laws and regulations were based on Sunni ''[[fiqh]]''. In July 1980, 25,000 Shia protested the [[Islamization]] laws in the capital [[Islamabad]]. Further exacerbating the situation was the dislike between Shia leader Imam Khomeini and General Zia ul-Haq.<ref>Nasr, Vali, ''The Shia Revival'', Norton, (2006), pp. 161\u201362</ref>\n\nShia formed student associations and a Shia party, Sunni began to form sectarian militias recruited from Deobandi and [[Ahl al-Hadith]] madrasahs. Preaching against the Shia in Pakistan was cleric [[Israr Ahmed]]. Muhammad Manzour Numani, a senior Indian cleric with close ties to Saudi Arabia published a book entitled ''Iranian Revolution: Imam Khomeini and Shiism''. The book, which \"became the gospel of Deobandi militants\" in the 1980s, attacked Khomeini and argued the excesses of the Islamic revolution were proof that Shiism was not the doctrine of misguided brothers, but beyond the Islamic pale.<ref>Nasr, Vali, ''The Shia Revival,'' Norton, (2006), p. 164</ref>\n\nAnti-Shia groups in Pakistan include the [[Lashkar-e-Jhangvi]] and [[Sipah-e-Sahaba Pakistan]], offshoots of the [[Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam]] (JUI).

Also, some Sunni-accepted hadith are less favored by Shias; one example is that because of Aisha's opposition to Ali, hadiths narrated by Aisha are not given the same authority as those by other companions. Another example is hadith narrated by [[Abu Hurairah#Shi'a view|Abu Hurairah]], who is considered by Shias as the enemy of Ali. The Shia argument is that Abu Hurairah was only a Muslim four years of his life before Muhammad's death.

Nevertheless, apart from this domination there existed, firstly, throughout these nine centuries, Shia inclinations among many Sunnis of this land and, secondly, Twelver and Zaidi Shiism had prevalence in some parts of Iran. During this period, the Shia in Iran were nourished from [[Kufa]], [[Baghdad]] and later from [[Najaf]] and [[Al Hillah]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.al-islam.org/mot/iraqishiism/|title=Four Centuries of Influence of Iraqi Shiism on Pre-Safavid Iran|work=Al-Islam.org}}</ref> Shia were dominant in Tabaristan, [[Qom]], [[Kashan]], [[Avaj]] and [[Sabzevar]].

This spread of Shiism to the inner circles of the government enabled the Shia to withstand those who opposed them by relying upon the power of the caliphate.\n\nTwelvers came to Iran from Arab regions in the course of four stages. First, through the [[Asharis tribe]]{{Clarify|date=August 2013}} at the end of the 7th and during the 8th century. Second through the pupils of Sabzevar, and especially those of [[Al-Shaykh Al-Mufid]], who were from [[Rey, Iran|Rey]] and [[Sabzawar]] and resided in those cities. Third, through the school of Hillah under the leadership of [[Al-Hilli]] and his son [[Fakhr al-Muhaqqiqin]]. Fourth, through the scholars of [[Jabal Amel]] residing in that region, or in Iraq, during the 16th and 17th centuries who later migrated to Iran.<ref name=\"Jafarian2\">{{cite web|url=http://www.imamreza.net/eng/imamreza.php?print=589|title=A Study of the Migration of Shi'i Works from Arab Regions to Iran at the Early Safavid Era. -- Imam Reza (A.S.)

''d\u0101\u2018\u012b'') during the [[Fatimid Caliphate]] to Persia. When the Ismailis divided into two sects, [[Nizari]]s established their base in northern Persia. [[Hassan-i Sabbah]] conquered fortresses and captured [[Alamut]] in 1090. Nizaris used this fortress until the [[Mongols]] finally seized and destroyed it in 1256.\n\nAfter the Mongols and the fall of the Abbasids, the Sunni [[Ulama]] suffered greatly. In addition to the destruction of the caliphate there was no official Sunni school of law. Many libraries and madrasahs were destroyed and Sunni scholars migrated to other Islamic areas such as [[Anatolia]] and Egypt. In contrast, most Shia were largely unaffected as their center was not in Iran at this time. For the first time, the Shia could openly convert other Muslims to their movement.\n\nSeveral local Shia dynasties like the [[Marashi]] and Sarbadars were established during this time. The kings of the [[Kara Koyunlu]] dynasty ruled in [[Tabriz]] with a domain extending to [[Fars Province|Fars]] and [[Kerman]].

It was followed by the Mirdasid Shi'ite emirate in the 11th century, with both the emirates centered at Aleppo. \n\nThe general observations recorded by Muslim travellers passing through the Levant during the tenth and eleventh centuries, notably al-Maqdisi in his geographical works, \u201cThe best divisions in the knowledge of the regions\u201d, as well as Ibn Jubayr, indicate that Shia Muslims made up the majority of the populations of the regions of the Levant during this era, notably in the cities of Damascus, Tiberias, Nablus, Tyre, Homs and Jabal Amel. In addition to the account of [[Nasir Khusraw]] who visited [[Jerusalem]] in the year 1045 AD and reported: \"The population of Jerusalem is about 20,000, the populace being mostly Shi'a Muslims\". In  the 10th century the Nusayri faith started spreading in the area surrounding Aleppo, but in 1030 the Nusayris were kicked out of Aleppo and its missionaries forced to proselytize in what is today known as the Syrian coastal mountain region. The Nusayri faith was originally an extreme school of thought of Twelver Shia Islam that broke away later on. The Druze initially appeared sometime during the rule of Fatimid Caliph al-Hakim bi Amr Allah. \n\nHowever, during the era of the crusades, the swift advancements of the Crusader armies into the Levant forced lots of these Shias to abandon these places, with a large influx of Shias migrating from the area of modern-day Palestine especially from the Galilee to the area of modern-day Lebanon, specifically the south, during the Frankish rule after it had been left most likely thinly populated. Others were left to convert out of their faith especially during the Ayyubid rule given the likely disinterest of Shias in the affairs of the Franks. The Shiite population near what is now Aleppo became thin during the rule of Nur ad-Din Zengi, after many of them were forced to flee.\n\nWhen the Mongols captured Baghdad in 1258, many Sayed families and followers fled modern-day Iraq and Baghdad to the west in what is now modern-day Lebanon. These people settled in the northern coastal mountains of modern-day Lebanon, Keserwan specifically, which already housed a small community of Twelvers, Nusayris and probably Ismailis before the crusades. In 1305, the Mamelukes carried out a grand campaign to erase the Shiite dominance in the coastal mountains of Lebanon. This campaign forced most the Shiites to disperse, with some fleeing south to Jabal Amel and some to the Bekaa, while a very small portion of them took on the practice of Taqiyya until the Ottomans came in 1517.\nMany Shias in the Levant continued to be killed during this period for their faith. One of these was [[Muhammad Jamaluddin al-Makki al-Amili|Muhammad Ibn Makki]], called ''Shahid-i Awwal (the First Martyr)'', one of the great figures in Shia jurisprudence, who was killed in [[Damascus]] in 1384.<ref name=\"athir\"/> \n\n[[Shahab al-Din Suhrawardi]] was another eminent scholar, killed in [[Aleppo]] on charges of cultivating [[Batiniyya|Batini]] teachings and philosophy.<ref name=\"athir\"/>\n\n===India===\n{{Main|Islam in Asia}}\nSunni\u2013Shia clashes also occurred occasionally in the 20th century in India. There were many between 1904 and 1908. These clashes revolved around the public cursing of the first three caliphs by Shias and the praising of them by Sunnis. To put a stop to the violence, public demonstrations were banned in 1909 on the three most sensitive days: [[Day of Ashura|Ashura]], [[Arba'een|Chehlum]] and Ali's death on 21 Ramadan. Intercommunal violence resurfaced in 1935\u201336 and again in 1939 when many thousands of Sunni and Shias defied the ban on public demonstrations and took to the streets.<ref>Momen, Moojan, ''An Introduction to Shi'i Islam'', Yale University Press, 1985, p. 276</ref> Shia are estimated to be 21\u201335% of the Muslim population in South Asia, although the total number is difficult to estimate due to the intermingling between the two groups and practice of ''[[taqiyya]]'' by Shia.<ref>Momen, Moojan, ''An Introduction to Shi'i Islam'', Yale University Press, 1985, p. 277</ref>\n\nSunni razzias which came to be known as ''Taarajs'' virtually devastated the community.

According to scholar [[Vali Nasr]], as the Muslim world was decolonialised and [[Arab nationalism]] lost its appeal, fundamentalism blossomed and reasserted the differences and conflicts between the two movements, particularly in the strict teachings of Sunni scholar [[Ibn Taymiyyah]].<ref name=nasr-2006-106>Nasr, Vali, ''The Shia Revival'', Norton, 2006, pp. 106\u201307</ref> The Iranian Islamic revolution changed the Shia\u2013Sunni power equation in Muslim countries \"from Lebanon to India\" arousing the traditionally subservient Shia to the alarm of traditionally dominant and very non-revolutionary Sunni.<ref name=nasr-2006-148>Nasr, Vali, ''The Shia Revival'', Norton, (2006), pp. 148\u201350</ref> \"Where Iranian revolutionaries saw Islamic revolutionary stirrings, Sunnis saw mostly Shia mischief and a threat to Sunni predominance.\"<ref>Nasr, Vali, ''The Shia Revival'', Norton, (2006), pp. 143\u201344</ref>\n\nAlthough the Iranian revolution's leader, [[Ayatollah Khomeini]], was very much in favor of Shia\u2013Sunni unity, he also challenged Saudi Arabia, in his view an \"unpopular and corrupt dictatorship\" and an \"American lackey\" ripe for revolution. In part because Saudi Arabia was the world's major international [[Islamism#Saudi Arabian funding|funder]] of Islamic schools, scholarships, and fellowships, this angered not only Saudi Arabia but its many fundamentalist allies and benefactors throughout the Arab world, according to Nasr.<ref name=\"Nasr, Vali 2006 p.143-4\">Nasr, Vali, ''The Shia Revival,'' Norton, (2006), pp. 143\u201344, 147\u201348, 150\u201351</ref>\n\nAnother effect noted by political scientist [[Gilles Kepel]], is that the initial attraction of the [[Islamic Revolution]] to Sunnis as well as Shia, and Khomeini's desire to export his revolution, motivated the Saudi establishment to shore up its \"religious legitimacy\" with more strictness in religion (and with jihad in Afghanistan) to compete with Iran's revolutionary ideology.<ref name=GKJTPI2002:137>[[#GKJTPI2002|Kepel, ''Jihad'', 2002]]: p. 137</ref> But doing so in Saudi meant a more anti-Shia policies because Saudi's own native Sunni school of Islam is [[Wahhabism]], which includes the prohibition of Shia Islam itself, as strict Wahhabis do not consider Shia to be Islamic. This new strictness was spread not only among Saudis in the kingdom but thousands of students and Saudi funded schools and international Islamist volunteers who came to training camps in Peshawar Pakistan in the 1980s to learn to fight jihad in Afghanistan and went home in the 1990s to fight jihad.

Ali Bhutto was Shia, Zia ul-Haq a Sunni.<ref>Nasr, Vali, ''The Shia Revival'', Norton, (2006), p. 89</ref>\n\n[[Zia-ul-Haq's Islamization]] that followed was resisted by Shia who saw it as \"Sunnification\" as the laws and regulations were based on Sunni ''[[fiqh]]''. In July 1980, 25,000 Shia protested the [[Islamization]] laws in the capital [[Islamabad]]. Further exacerbating the situation was the dislike between Shia leader Imam Khomeini and General Zia ul-Haq.<ref>Nasr, Vali, ''The Shia Revival'', Norton, (2006), pp. 161\u201362</ref>\n\nShia formed student associations and a Shia party, Sunni began to form sectarian militias recruited from Deobandi and [[Ahl al-Hadith]] madrasahs. Preaching against the Shia in Pakistan was cleric [[Israr Ahmed]]. Muhammad Manzour Numani, a senior Indian cleric with close ties to Saudi Arabia published a book entitled ''Iranian Revolution: Imam Khomeini and Shiism''. The book, which \"became the gospel of Deobandi militants\" in the 1980s, attacked Khomeini and argued the excesses of the Islamic revolution were proof that Shiism was not the doctrine of misguided brothers, but beyond the Islamic pale.<ref>Nasr, Vali, ''The Shia Revival,'' Norton, (2006), p. 164</ref>\n\nAnti-Shia groups in Pakistan include the [[Lashkar-e-Jhangvi]] and [[Sipah-e-Sahaba Pakistan]], offshoots of the [[Jamiat Ulema-e-Islam]] (JUI).

Vaughan]] was hired to write a screenplay for [[Marvel Studios]] in May 2008, based on his comic book ''[[Runaways (comics)|Runaways]]''.<ref name=\"RunawaysMay2008\" /> In April 2010, Marvel hired [[Peter Sollett]] to direct the film,<ref name=\"SollettRunaways\" /> and a month later [[Drew Pearce]] signed on to write a new script.<ref name=\"PearceRunaways\" /> Development on the film was put on hold the following October,<ref name=\"RunawaysHold\" /> and Pearce explained in September 2013 that the ''Runaways'' film had been shelved due to the success of ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]''; the earliest the film could be made was for Phase Three of the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]].<ref name=\"PearceRunaways2\" /> In October 2014, after announcing Marvel's Phase Three films without ''Runaways'', Marvel Studios president [[Kevin Feige]] said the project was \"still an awesome script that exists in our script vault ... In our television and future film discussions, it's always one that we talk about, because we have a solid draft there. [But] we can't make them all.\"<ref name=\"Oct2014EventQA\" />\n\n[[Marvel Television]], based at [[ABC Studios]], was waiting for the right [[showrunner]] before moving forward with a television take on the characters. [[Josh Schwartz]] and [[Stephanie Savage]], whose company [[Fake Empire Productions]] had an overall deal with ABC, independently brought up the property during a general meeting with the studio,<ref name=\"TCAJul2017\" /><ref name=\"RunawaysHulu\" /> and, by August 2016, the pair had spent a year conversing with Marvel about turning ''Runaways'' into a television series. That month, it was announced that streaming service [[Hulu]] had ordered a pilot episode and scripts for a full season of ''Runaways'', to be co-produced by Marvel Television, [[ABC Studios#ABC Signature|ABC Signature Studios]], and Fake Empire Productions. Hulu was believed to already have \"an eye toward a full-season greenlight\".<ref name=\"RunawaysHulu\" /><ref name=\"RunawaysHuluVariety\" /> Executive producer [[Jeph Loeb]] felt \"it was an easy decision\" to have Hulu air the series over the other networks Marvel Television works with, because \"[w]e were very excited about the possibility of joining a network that was young and growing in the same way that when we went to [[Netflix]] when it was young and growing on the original side. It really feels like we're in the right place at the right time with the right show.\" Loeb and Marvel Television were also impressed by the success of Hulu's ''[[The Handmaid's Tale (TV series)|The Handmaid's Tale]]'', which helped further justify the decision.<ref name=\"WhyHulu\" /> Schwartz and Savage wrote the pilot, and serve as showrunners on the series, as well as executive producers alongside Loeb and Jim Chory.<ref name=\"RunawaysHulu\" /><ref name=\"RunawaysHuluVariety\" /> In May 2017, ''Runaways'' received a 10-episode series order from Hulu at their annual advertising [[Upfront (advertising)|upfront]] presentation.<ref name=\"SeriesOrder\" />\n\nFake Empire's Lis Rowinski produces the series,<ref name=\"RunawaysHulu\" /><ref name=\"RunawaysHuluVariety\" /> and Vaughan serves as an executive consultant.<ref name=\"CastAnnounce\" /> On this, Vaughan noted he \"did a little consulting early in the process\", but felt the series \"found the ideal 'foster parents' in Josh Schwartz and Stephanie Savage \u2026 [who] lovingly adapted [the comics] into a stylish drama that feels like contemporary Los Angeles\". He also praised the cast, crew and writers working on the series, and felt the pilot looked \"like an [[Adrian Alphona]] comic\", referring to the artist who worked with Vaughan when he created the characters.<ref name=\"VaughanMay2017\" /> Loeb said that it had been Schwartz and Savage who had asked that Vaughan be involved, and said that this was something that \"a lot of showrunners don't immediately gravitate towards\". In discussions with Vaughan, Marvel found that he \"really wanted to be involved and make sure that it was done, not just properly, but in a way that it would last 100 episodes\".<ref name=\"EPsColliderSet\" /> On January 8, 2018, Hulu renewed the series for a 13-episode second season.<ref name=\"RunawaysS2\" />\n\nOn March 24, 2019, Hulu renewed the series for a ten-episode third season.<ref name=\"RunawaysS3\" /> That November, it was announced the third season would be the final one for the series.<ref name=\"Cancelled\" />\n\n===Writing===\nSchwartz was a fan of the ''Runaways'' comic for some time, and introduced it to Savage, saying, \"When you're a teenager, everything feels like life and death, and the stakes in this story\u2014really felt like that.\" Loeb described the series as ''[[The O.C.]]'' of the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU),<ref name=\"TCAJul2017\" /> which Schwartz said meant \"treating the problems of teenagers as if they are adults\" and having the series \"feel true and authentic to the teenage experience, even in this heightened context\".<ref name=\"ShowrunnersIGNAug2017\" /> Loeb noted that it would deal with modern political issues by saying, \"This is a time when figures of authority are in question, and this is a story where teenagers are at that age where they see their parents as fallible and human. Just because someone is in charge, doesn't mean that they're here to do good.\"<ref name=\"TCAJul2017\" /> The producers did note that the series would explore the parents' perspective as well, with the pilot telling the story from the Runaways' perspective, and the second episode showing the same story from their parents'\u2014the [[Pride (comics)|Pride]]'s\u2014perspective, with the two stories converging midway through the first season.<ref name=\"TCAJul2017THR\" />\n\nSchwartz likened the tone of ''Runaways'' to that of the comics it was based on, calling it \"so distinct\", saying much of the tone Vaughn used when writing the comics overlapped with the tones Schwartz and Savage like to work in.<ref name=\"ShowrunnersIGNAug2017\" /> The pair were excited by the freedom given to them by Hulu over the usual broadcasters they were used to working with, such as allowing the children to swear in the show, not having set lengths for each episode, and being able to explore the parents' story; Hulu wanted \"something that felt broad and where we could push the envelope in places\". Schwartz described the series as a coming-of-age story and a family drama, with focus on the characters that can lead to long stretches of the series not featuring super powers, so \"if you didn't see the show title, you wouldn't know that you were in a Marvel show for long stretches ... That was our aesthetic starting place, but there are episodes where there's some good [Marvel] stuff.\"<ref name=\"EPsColliderSet\" />\n\nSpeaking to the second season, Schwartz felt the series would \"accelerate\" since the season would be following the kids on the run, saying, \"Our focus shifts to these kids and trying to survive in the streets\u2026 there's a greater sense of tension and momentum in keeping with where we are in this part of the story.\" He added that the kids' experience on the run would force them to grow up and make them confront and deal with adult themes quickly.<ref name=\"DeadlineTCA2018\" /> He added that the relationship between Nico and Karolina that began at the end of the first season would be \"the emotional core\" of the second.<ref name=\"NicoKarolinaS2Relationship\" /> As for the parents in the season, Schwartz described them as racing against the clock \"to find their kids before something catastrophic potentially could occur\".<ref name=\"DeadlineTCA2018\" /> Since the kids know about their powers, they are utilized more in the season. Additionally, the hostel the kids move into is a dilapidated mansion under [[Griffith Park]].<ref name=\"THRS2SetVisit\" />\n\nWith the third season being the final one of the series, \"the story [was] said to come to a natural ending point\".<ref name=\"Cancelled\" /> When crafting the season, Schwartz and Savage were unsure if the season would be the last for the series, so they \"wanted to ensure that the finale was as satisfying as possible\" and crafted it as if it was a series finale, while \"hav[ing] the potential for another story out there whether it\u2019s something that we get to see onscreen or something that lives on in the imagination of the audience.\" The final moments of the episode see Alex find a note from his future self, telling him to hide \"Mancha\" and to kill Nico; in the comics, [[Victor Mancha]] was the son of [[Ultron]] who would join the Runaways to become a hero, and Alex betrays his friends. Time travel elements are also featured in the final episode, something teased in the previous seasons, which Savage said was \"in the DNA of the comics so it was something that we wanted to honor\".<ref name=\"EWShowrunnersS3Ending\" />\n\n===Casting===\n[[File:Runaways cast at 2017 New York Comic Con.jpg|thumb|Cast of ''Runaways'' at the 2017 [[New York Comic Con]] (L-R:  [[Rhenzy Feliz]], [[Lyrica Okano]], [[Gregg Sulkin]], [[Virginia Gardner]] and [[Ariela Barer]])]]\nIn February 2017, Marvel announced the casting of the Runaways, with [[Rhenzy Feliz]] as [[Alex Wilder]], [[Lyrica Okano]] as [[Nico Minoru]], [[Virginia Gardner]] as [[Karolina Dean]], [[Ariela Barer]] as [[Gert Yorkes]], [[Gregg Sulkin]] as [[Chase Stein]], and [[Allegra Acosta]] as [[Molly Hayes|Molly Hernandez]].<ref name=\"CastAnnounce\" /> Shortly after, Marvel announced the casting of the Pride, with [[Ryan Sands]] as [[Geoffrey Wilder]], [[Angel Parker]] as Catherine Wilder, [[Brittany Ishibashi]] as [[Tina Minoru]], [[James Yaegashi]] as Robert Minoru, [[Kevin Weisman]] as Dale Yorkes, [[Brigid Brannagh]] as Stacey Yorkes, [[Annie Wersching]] as Leslie Dean, [[Kip Pardue]] as Frank Dean, [[James Marsters]] as Victor Stein, and [[Ever Carradine]] as Janet Stein.<ref name=\"PrideCastAnnounce\" /> Loeb praised casting director Patrick Rush, explaining that all of the series regulars for ''Runaways'' were the producers' first choice for the role. The majority of the children are portrayed by \"fresh faces\", which was an intentional choice.<ref name=\"EPsColliderSet\" /> By August 2017, [[Julian McMahon]] had been cast in the recurring role of Jonah.<ref name=\"McMahon\" /> He was promoted to series regular for the second season.<ref name=\"DeadlineS2Trailer\" />\n\nFor the second season, Schwartz noted that \"really popular, exciting characters\" from the comics would appear.<ref name=\"DeadlineTCA2018\" /> In October 2018, it was announced that Jan Luis Castellanos had joined the cast as [[Topher (comics)|Topher]].<ref name=\"Topher\" /> Clarissa Thibeaux was cast as [[Xavin]].<ref name=\"Xavin\"/>\n\nIn June 2019, [[Elizabeth Hurley]] was announced as cast in the role of [[Morgan le Fay (Marvel Comics)|Morgan le Fay]] for the third season.<ref name=\"HurleyCastS3\"/>\n\n===Filming===\nFilming on the pilot began by February 10, 2017,<ref name=\"FilmingStart2\" /> in Los Angeles,<ref name=\"FilmingStart\" /> under the [[working title]] ''Rugrats'',<ref name=\"WorkingTitle\" /> and concluded on March 3.<ref name=\"PilotFilmingEnd\" /> Director [[Brett Morgen]] was given free rein by Marvel and Hulu to establish the look of the series,<ref name=\"MorgenCollider\" /> and wanted to create a feel that was \"very grounded and authentic\".<ref name=\"EPsColliderSet\" /> He also looked to differentiate between the hand-held, gritty world of the Runaways and the more stylistic world of the Pride. He felt the latter could be explored more in the series moving forward, but was not available to direct any more episodes of the season.<ref name=\"MorgenCollider\" /> Following completion of the pilot and the show's pick-up to series, there was concern among the cast and crew that the impending writers' strike would prevent the series to move forward. However, the strike did not happen, and filming on the rest of the season began at the end of June, again in Los Angeles.<ref name=\"SulkinWizard\" /> Production on the season had concluded by October 21.<ref name=\"SeasonFilmingEnd\" />\n\nProduction on the second season began the week of April 23, 2018, again in Los Angeles under the working title ''Rugrats''.<ref name=\"SulkinS2Filming\" /><ref name=\"S2Filming\" /> Filming on the season continued until late September 2018.<ref name=\"S2Filming\" /><ref name=\"S2FilmingWrap\" /> Filming for the third season began on May 13, 2019.<ref name=\"S3Filming\" />\n\n===Music===\nIn May 2017, [[Siddhartha Khosla]] was hired to compose the music for the series.<ref name=\"Khosla\" /> Khosla said that, due to his history as a songwriter, his scoring process involves \"working on these song-stories and weaving them through different episodes\". He described the ''Runaways'' score as being \"completely synthesized\",<ref name=\"KhoslaJul2017\" /> utilizing analog synthesizers from the 1980s, specifically the [[Roland Juno-60]] and [[Oberheim Electronics]]' synths. Khosla compared the \"alternative feel\" of his score to [[Depeche Mode]], adding \"there is an element of rebellion, so sonically going for something that is a little bit outside the box, non-traditional, I felt was an appropriate approach. I feel like I'm making art on this show.\"<ref name=\"VarietyMusicAug2017\" /> [[Alex Patsavas]] serves as [[music supervisor]], having done so on all of Schwartz and Savage's previous series.<ref name=\"ShowrunnersIGNAug2017\" /> On January 12, 2018, a soundtrack from the first season consisting of 12 licensed tracks plus two by Khosla, was released digitally.<ref name=\"Soundtracks\" />\n\n{{Track listing\n| collapsed       = yes\n| headline        = ''Runaways (Original Soundtrack)''\n| total_length    = \n| extra_column    = Artist(s)\n\n| title1   = Runaways Theme\n| extra1   = [[Siddhartha Khosla]]\n| length1  = 1:13\n| title2   = May I Have This Dance\n| extra2   = [[Francis and the Lights]]\n| length2  = 2:53\n| title3   = Cane Shuga\n| extra3   = [[Glass Animals]]\n| length3  = 3:17\n| title4   = King Charles (Clean)\n| extra4   = [[Yungblud]]\n| length4  = 2:41\n| title5   = [[Drinkee]]\n| extra5   = [[Sofi Tukker]]\n| length5  = 4:59\n| title6   = [[Ocean Eyes (song)|Ocean Eyes (Blackbear Remix)]]\n| extra6   = [[Billie Eilish]]\n| length6  = 3:14\n| title7   = Beat Goes On\n| extra7   = Lizzy Land\n| length7  = 3:40\n| title8   = All My Heroes\n| extra8   = [[Bleachers (band)|Bleachers]]\n| length8  = 3:03\n| title9   = Antidote (Live Arrangement)\n| extra9   = [[Emily Wells]]\n| length9  = 5:43\n| title10  = Fuerza (feat.

The fact that they've found each other and they're going through this mystery together at the moment is what we're concerned about, not what [[Steve Rogers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Captain America]] is doing.\" The showrunners considered the series' connection to the MCU to be \"liberating\", as it allowed them to set the series in a universe where superheroics and fantasy are already established and do not need to be explained to the audience.<ref name=\"WrapMCU\" /> Schwartz said they  \"were very capable of telling the story that we wanted to tell independent of any of the other Marvel stories that are out there.\"<ref name=\"ShowrunnersIGNAug2017\" /> Initially, Loeb had said that there were no plans to crossover across networks with the similarly themed ''[[Cloak & Dagger (TV series)|Cloak & Dagger]]'' on [[Freeform (TV channel)|Freeform]], as Marvel wanted the series to find its footing before further connecting with other elements of the universe, though \"You'll see things that comment on each other; we try to touch base wherever we can... things that are happening in L.A. are not exactly going to be affecting what's happening in New Orleans [where ''Cloak & Dagger'' is set]...

Vaughan]] was hired to write a screenplay for [[Marvel Studios]] in May 2008, based on his comic book ''[[Runaways (comics)|Runaways]]''.<ref name=\"RunawaysMay2008\" /> In April 2010, Marvel hired [[Peter Sollett]] to direct the film,<ref name=\"SollettRunaways\" /> and a month later [[Drew Pearce]] signed on to write a new script.<ref name=\"PearceRunaways\" /> Development on the film was put on hold the following October,<ref name=\"RunawaysHold\" /> and Pearce explained in September 2013 that the ''Runaways'' film had been shelved due to the success of ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|The Avengers]]''; the earliest the film could be made was for Phase Three of the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]].<ref name=\"PearceRunaways2\" /> In October 2014, after announcing Marvel's Phase Three films without ''Runaways'', Marvel Studios president [[Kevin Feige]] said the project was \"still an awesome script that exists in our script vault ... In our television and future film discussions, it's always one that we talk about, because we have a solid draft there. [But] we can't make them all.\"<ref name=\"Oct2014EventQA\" />\n\n[[Marvel Television]], based at [[ABC Studios]], was waiting for the right [[showrunner]] before moving forward with a television take on the characters. [[Josh Schwartz]] and [[Stephanie Savage]], whose company [[Fake Empire Productions]] had an overall deal with ABC, independently brought up the property during a general meeting with the studio,<ref name=\"TCAJul2017\" /><ref name=\"RunawaysHulu\" /> and, by August 2016, the pair had spent a year conversing with Marvel about turning ''Runaways'' into a television series. That month, it was announced that streaming service [[Hulu]] had ordered a pilot episode and scripts for a full season of ''Runaways'', to be co-produced by Marvel Television, [[ABC Studios#ABC Signature|ABC Signature Studios]], and Fake Empire Productions. Hulu was believed to already have \"an eye toward a full-season greenlight\".<ref name=\"RunawaysHulu\" /><ref name=\"RunawaysHuluVariety\" /> Executive producer [[Jeph Loeb]] felt \"it was an easy decision\" to have Hulu air the series over the other networks Marvel Television works with, because \"[w]e were very excited about the possibility of joining a network that was young and growing in the same way that when we went to [[Netflix]] when it was young and growing on the original side. It really feels like we're in the right place at the right time with the right show.\" Loeb and Marvel Television were also impressed by the success of Hulu's ''[[The Handmaid's Tale (TV series)|The Handmaid's Tale]]'', which helped further justify the decision.<ref name=\"WhyHulu\" /> Schwartz and Savage wrote the pilot, and serve as showrunners on the series, as well as executive producers alongside Loeb and Jim Chory.<ref name=\"RunawaysHulu\" /><ref name=\"RunawaysHuluVariety\" /> In May 2017, ''Runaways'' received a 10-episode series order from Hulu at their annual advertising [[Upfront (advertising)|upfront]] presentation.<ref name=\"SeriesOrder\" />\n\nFake Empire's Lis Rowinski produces the series,<ref name=\"RunawaysHulu\" /><ref name=\"RunawaysHuluVariety\" /> and Vaughan serves as an executive consultant.<ref name=\"CastAnnounce\" /> On this, Vaughan noted he \"did a little consulting early in the process\", but felt the series \"found the ideal 'foster parents' in Josh Schwartz and Stephanie Savage \u2026 [who] lovingly adapted [the comics] into a stylish drama that feels like contemporary Los Angeles\". He also praised the cast, crew and writers working on the series, and felt the pilot looked \"like an [[Adrian Alphona]] comic\", referring to the artist who worked with Vaughan when he created the characters.<ref name=\"VaughanMay2017\" /> Loeb said that it had been Schwartz and Savage who had asked that Vaughan be involved, and said that this was something that \"a lot of showrunners don't immediately gravitate towards\". In discussions with Vaughan, Marvel found that he \"really wanted to be involved and make sure that it was done, not just properly, but in a way that it would last 100 episodes\".<ref name=\"EPsColliderSet\" /> On January 8, 2018, Hulu renewed the series for a 13-episode second season.<ref name=\"RunawaysS2\" />\n\nOn March 24, 2019, Hulu renewed the series for a ten-episode third season.<ref name=\"RunawaysS3\" /> That November, it was announced the third season would be the final one for the series.<ref name=\"Cancelled\" />\n\n===Writing===\nSchwartz was a fan of the ''Runaways'' comic for some time, and introduced it to Savage, saying, \"When you're a teenager, everything feels like life and death, and the stakes in this story\u2014really felt like that.\" Loeb described the series as ''[[The O.C.]]'' of the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]] (MCU),<ref name=\"TCAJul2017\" /> which Schwartz said meant \"treating the problems of teenagers as if they are adults\" and having the series \"feel true and authentic to the teenage experience, even in this heightened context\".<ref name=\"ShowrunnersIGNAug2017\" /> Loeb noted that it would deal with modern political issues by saying, \"This is a time when figures of authority are in question, and this is a story where teenagers are at that age where they see their parents as fallible and human. Just because someone is in charge, doesn't mean that they're here to do good.\"<ref name=\"TCAJul2017\" /> The producers did note that the series would explore the parents' perspective as well, with the pilot telling the story from the Runaways' perspective, and the second episode showing the same story from their parents'\u2014the [[Pride (comics)|Pride]]'s\u2014perspective, with the two stories converging midway through the first season.<ref name=\"TCAJul2017THR\" />\n\nSchwartz likened the tone of ''Runaways'' to that of the comics it was based on, calling it \"so distinct\", saying much of the tone Vaughn used when writing the comics overlapped with the tones Schwartz and Savage like to work in.<ref name=\"ShowrunnersIGNAug2017\" /> The pair were excited by the freedom given to them by Hulu over the usual broadcasters they were used to working with, such as allowing the children to swear in the show, not having set lengths for each episode, and being able to explore the parents' story; Hulu wanted \"something that felt broad and where we could push the envelope in places\". Schwartz described the series as a coming-of-age story and a family drama, with focus on the characters that can lead to long stretches of the series not featuring super powers, so \"if you didn't see the show title, you wouldn't know that you were in a Marvel show for long stretches ... That was our aesthetic starting place, but there are episodes where there's some good [Marvel] stuff.\"<ref name=\"EPsColliderSet\" />\n\nSpeaking to the second season, Schwartz felt the series would \"accelerate\" since the season would be following the kids on the run, saying, \"Our focus shifts to these kids and trying to survive in the streets\u2026 there's a greater sense of tension and momentum in keeping with where we are in this part of the story.\" He added that the kids' experience on the run would force them to grow up and make them confront and deal with adult themes quickly.<ref name=\"DeadlineTCA2018\" /> He added that the relationship between Nico and Karolina that began at the end of the first season would be \"the emotional core\" of the second.<ref name=\"NicoKarolinaS2Relationship\" /> As for the parents in the season, Schwartz described them as racing against the clock \"to find their kids before something catastrophic potentially could occur\".<ref name=\"DeadlineTCA2018\" /> Since the kids know about their powers, they are utilized more in the season. Additionally, the hostel the kids move into is a dilapidated mansion under [[Griffith Park]].<ref name=\"THRS2SetVisit\" />\n\nWith the third season being the final one of the series, \"the story [was] said to come to a natural ending point\".<ref name=\"Cancelled\" /> When crafting the season, Schwartz and Savage were unsure if the season would be the last for the series, so they \"wanted to ensure that the finale was as satisfying as possible\" and crafted it as if it was a series finale, while \"hav[ing] the potential for another story out there whether it\u2019s something that we get to see onscreen or something that lives on in the imagination of the audience.\" The final moments of the episode see Alex find a note from his future self, telling him to hide \"Mancha\" and to kill Nico; in the comics, [[Victor Mancha]] was the son of [[Ultron]] who would join the Runaways to become a hero, and Alex betrays his friends. Time travel elements are also featured in the final episode, something teased in the previous seasons, which Savage said was \"in the DNA of the comics so it was something that we wanted to honor\".<ref name=\"EWShowrunnersS3Ending\" />\n\n===Casting===\n[[File:Runaways cast at 2017 New York Comic Con.jpg|thumb|Cast of ''Runaways'' at the 2017 [[New York Comic Con]] (L-R:  [[Rhenzy Feliz]], [[Lyrica Okano]], [[Gregg Sulkin]], [[Virginia Gardner]] and [[Ariela Barer]])]]\nIn February 2017, Marvel announced the casting of the Runaways, with [[Rhenzy Feliz]] as [[Alex Wilder]], [[Lyrica Okano]] as [[Nico Minoru]], [[Virginia Gardner]] as [[Karolina Dean]], [[Ariela Barer]] as [[Gert Yorkes]], [[Gregg Sulkin]] as [[Chase Stein]], and [[Allegra Acosta]] as [[Molly Hayes|Molly Hernandez]].<ref name=\"CastAnnounce\" /> Shortly after, Marvel announced the casting of the Pride, with [[Ryan Sands]] as [[Geoffrey Wilder]], [[Angel Parker]] as Catherine Wilder, [[Brittany Ishibashi]] as [[Tina Minoru]], [[James Yaegashi]] as Robert Minoru, [[Kevin Weisman]] as Dale Yorkes, [[Brigid Brannagh]] as Stacey Yorkes, [[Annie Wersching]] as Leslie Dean, [[Kip Pardue]] as Frank Dean, [[James Marsters]] as Victor Stein, and [[Ever Carradine]] as Janet Stein.<ref name=\"PrideCastAnnounce\" /> Loeb praised casting director Patrick Rush, explaining that all of the series regulars for ''Runaways'' were the producers' first choice for the role. The majority of the children are portrayed by \"fresh faces\", which was an intentional choice.<ref name=\"EPsColliderSet\" /> By August 2017, [[Julian McMahon]] had been cast in the recurring role of Jonah.<ref name=\"McMahon\" /> He was promoted to series regular for the second season.<ref name=\"DeadlineS2Trailer\" />\n\nFor the second season, Schwartz noted that \"really popular, exciting characters\" from the comics would appear.<ref name=\"DeadlineTCA2018\" /> In October 2018, it was announced that Jan Luis Castellanos had joined the cast as [[Topher (comics)|Topher]].<ref name=\"Topher\" /> Clarissa Thibeaux was cast as [[Xavin]].<ref name=\"Xavin\"/>\n\nIn June 2019, [[Elizabeth Hurley]] was announced as cast in the role of [[Morgan le Fay (Marvel Comics)|Morgan le Fay]] for the third season.<ref name=\"HurleyCastS3\"/>\n\n===Filming===\nFilming on the pilot began by February 10, 2017,<ref name=\"FilmingStart2\" /> in Los Angeles,<ref name=\"FilmingStart\" /> under the [[working title]] ''Rugrats'',<ref name=\"WorkingTitle\" /> and concluded on March 3.<ref name=\"PilotFilmingEnd\" /> Director [[Brett Morgen]] was given free rein by Marvel and Hulu to establish the look of the series,<ref name=\"MorgenCollider\" /> and wanted to create a feel that was \"very grounded and authentic\".<ref name=\"EPsColliderSet\" /> He also looked to differentiate between the hand-held, gritty world of the Runaways and the more stylistic world of the Pride. He felt the latter could be explored more in the series moving forward, but was not available to direct any more episodes of the season.<ref name=\"MorgenCollider\" /> Following completion of the pilot and the show's pick-up to series, there was concern among the cast and crew that the impending writers' strike would prevent the series to move forward. However, the strike did not happen, and filming on the rest of the season began at the end of June, again in Los Angeles.<ref name=\"SulkinWizard\" /> Production on the season had concluded by October 21.<ref name=\"SeasonFilmingEnd\" />\n\nProduction on the second season began the week of April 23, 2018, again in Los Angeles under the working title ''Rugrats''.<ref name=\"SulkinS2Filming\" /><ref name=\"S2Filming\" /> Filming on the season continued until late September 2018.<ref name=\"S2Filming\" /><ref name=\"S2FilmingWrap\" /> Filming for the third season began on May 13, 2019.<ref name=\"S3Filming\" />\n\n===Music===\nIn May 2017, [[Siddhartha Khosla]] was hired to compose the music for the series.<ref name=\"Khosla\" /> Khosla said that, due to his history as a songwriter, his scoring process involves \"working on these song-stories and weaving them through different episodes\". He described the ''Runaways'' score as being \"completely synthesized\",<ref name=\"KhoslaJul2017\" /> utilizing analog synthesizers from the 1980s, specifically the [[Roland Juno-60]] and [[Oberheim Electronics]]' synths. Khosla compared the \"alternative feel\" of his score to [[Depeche Mode]], adding \"there is an element of rebellion, so sonically going for something that is a little bit outside the box, non-traditional, I felt was an appropriate approach. I feel like I'm making art on this show.\"<ref name=\"VarietyMusicAug2017\" /> [[Alex Patsavas]] serves as [[music supervisor]], having done so on all of Schwartz and Savage's previous series.<ref name=\"ShowrunnersIGNAug2017\" /> On January 12, 2018, a soundtrack from the first season consisting of 12 licensed tracks plus two by Khosla, was released digitally.<ref name=\"Soundtracks\" />\n\n{{Track listing\n| collapsed       = yes\n| headline        = ''Runaways (Original Soundtrack)''\n| total_length    = \n| extra_column    = Artist(s)\n\n| title1   = Runaways Theme\n| extra1   = [[Siddhartha Khosla]]\n| length1  = 1:13\n| title2   = May I Have This Dance\n| extra2   = [[Francis and the Lights]]\n| length2  = 2:53\n| title3   = Cane Shuga\n| extra3   = [[Glass Animals]]\n| length3  = 3:17\n| title4   = King Charles (Clean)\n| extra4   = [[Yungblud]]\n| length4  = 2:41\n| title5   = [[Drinkee]]\n| extra5   = [[Sofi Tukker]]\n| length5  = 4:59\n| title6   = [[Ocean Eyes (song)|Ocean Eyes (Blackbear Remix)]]\n| extra6   = [[Billie Eilish]]\n| length6  = 3:14\n| title7   = Beat Goes On\n| extra7   = Lizzy Land\n| length7  = 3:40\n| title8   = All My Heroes\n| extra8   = [[Bleachers (band)|Bleachers]]\n| length8  = 3:03\n| title9   = Antidote (Live Arrangement)\n| extra9   = [[Emily Wells]]\n| length9  = 5:43\n| title10  = Fuerza (feat.

The fact that they've found each other and they're going through this mystery together at the moment is what we're concerned about, not what [[Steve Rogers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)|Captain America]] is doing.\" The showrunners considered the series' connection to the MCU to be \"liberating\", as it allowed them to set the series in a universe where superheroics and fantasy are already established and do not need to be explained to the audience.<ref name=\"WrapMCU\" /> Schwartz said they  \"were very capable of telling the story that we wanted to tell independent of any of the other Marvel stories that are out there.\"<ref name=\"ShowrunnersIGNAug2017\" /> Initially, Loeb had said that there were no plans to crossover across networks with the similarly themed ''[[Cloak & Dagger (TV series)|Cloak & Dagger]]'' on [[Freeform (TV channel)|Freeform]], as Marvel wanted the series to find its footing before further connecting with other elements of the universe, though \"You'll see things that comment on each other; we try to touch base wherever we can... things that are happening in L.A. are not exactly going to be affecting what's happening in New Orleans [where ''Cloak & Dagger'' is set]...

It ran for eight seasons on the [[Nine Network]] before it was canceled in late 2004 due to declining ratings and the late timeslot [[Nine Network|Channel Nine]] gave the program. The series has also aired in 65 countries, including Canada, Denmark, Egypt, France, Gibraltar, Iran, Ireland, Belgium, Luxembourg, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Turkey, the United Kingdom, the United States and Papua New Guinea. \n\nInspired by true events, ''Stingers'' chronicled the cases of a deep undercover unit of the [[Victoria Police]]. The series also followed their personal lives, which sometimes became intertwined with their jobs. The show received average [[Australian television ratings|rating]]s during its debut season, but after some major changes, including intensive character development, the series became a success the following year. The original cast members include [[Peter Phelps]], Joe Petruzzi, [[Kate Kendall]], [[Ian Stenlake]], [[Anita Hegh]], and [[Jessica Napier]].

Also in attendance was cast member [[Jeremy Kewley]] who posted the following rundown of the discussion for the Stingers forum:\n\n{{cquote|''Stingers'' came about in a very fast manner. John Wild had to get the show from a concept 'jotted down on paper' into a television series in just 11 weeks and in an 8.30pm time slot!}}\n\nIt first began airing up towards the end of the year, on Monday nights. It was up against another new show on [[Seven Network|Channel Seven]], ''[[Ally McBeal]]'', and ''Stingers'' beat ''McBeal'' regularly for its first 11 weeks before it went on its Christmas ratings break. When both shows returned after the ratings break, ''McBeal'' began to win in the ratings quite comfortably, worrying Nine executives.\n\nAt this time Channel Nine and the producers had to work out how to win ratings back, and found that the reason why so many people preferred ''Ally McBeal'' over ''Stingers'' was because ''Stingers'' had a very rough, edgy and realistic feel to it, and that this did not appeal to women of all ages, who preferred the lightness of ''McBeal''. So ''Stingers'' was moved to Tuesday night. This helped a bit, but not enough. Channel Nine were thinking about canceling the show, but Nine owner [[Kerry Packer]] liked the show and suggested that they keep it on the air. Nine did, but moved it an hour later to 9.30pm Tuesdays, and ''Stingers'' started to find its audience (although this was still not a big one). It stayed at this timeslot until the end of 7th season which seemed to be predominately male middle class white collar workers between the ages of 30\u201355.\n\nBy the middle of the second season, ratings were still not spectacular enough and Channel Nine commissioned research which showed that women were not particularly interested in ''Stingers''. As women make up 50% of the audience the producers were told to make the first major change to ''Stingers'': make it more female-friendly. This led to the departure of Joe Petruzzi, making [[Anita Hegh]]'s character the boss of the Unit. This also led to another female character being introduced, undercover operative Danni Mayo, portrayed by [[Roxane Wilson]]. This led to the show becoming more 'lighter' to appeal to the female audiences. Soon after, humour was added to the show, in the form of [[Jeremy Kewley]]'s character, Bryan Gray. These changes worked well and ''Stingers'' steamed through Seasons 3, 4 and 5, but then [[Anita Hegh]] and [[Ian Stenlake]] decided to leave the show, causing another drastic change in the series.\n\nChannel Nine, on a nationwide cost-cutting drive, hinted at dropping the show because ''Stingers''' was considered too expensive; its budget had crept up from its original $440,000-per-episode cost, to around $480,000. They dropped a bombshell on the producers: shave around $130,000 every week from the budget or the show would have to cease production.  A huge ask, but everyone at ''Stingers'' was keen to keep going as everyone felt there were still life in the show and plenty of stories to tell.\n\nBy the start of the next season the budget was chopped down to $350,000 per episode. Shooting changed from six days per episode to five, stock changed from 16&nbsp;mm film to SP Betacam Videotape, the crew became smaller, and writers were given less time to write each episode. The location changed from the \"Crimplex\" (warehouse/studio/offices by the [[Yarra River]]) to the studios of Channel Nine in [[Richmond, Victoria|Richmond]]. Channel Nine spent money on a big new set (plus a new \"hospital ward\" set and a new \"pub/bar\" set) and justified the cost by making sure that most of the action on the show now took place inside the studio on the new sets, with a lot less time spent on locations, with less money spent on car chases, stunts and special effects.\n\nChannel Nine also wanted more \"star power\" in the show, so [[Gary Sweet]] was brought in as Luke Harris (and [[Roxane Wilson]] decided to leave), and [[Rebecca Gibney]] \u2013 now out of a job without ''[[Halifax f.p.]]'' \u2013 was cast for the first few episodes of the new season. Most of these major changes worked quite well, and most viewers at home would not have been too aware of the changes to the visual quality of the show (such as using tape instead of film).\n\nBut, as Executive Producer John Wild humorously pointed out, \"the ratings didn't change one point!\"  Channel Nine commissioned more surveys that told them the show needed to appeal to younger viewers. So two new characters were added, played by [[Daniel Frederiksen]] and [[Jacinta Stapleton]], and, John Wild said, \"and the ratings still didn't change one point!\"  Channel Nine insisted that still more star power was needed to lift the ratings, so [[Lisa Chappell]] (Logie winning ''[[McLeod's Daughters]]'' star) joined the cast. After still no improvement to the ratings, more star power was further added in guest roles with [[Bill Hunter (actor)|Bill Hunter]], [[Gigi Edgley]], [[Steve Bisley]], [[Tottie Goldsmith]].  No improvement still.\n\n''Stingers'' was then \"rested\" for a couple of weeks and replaced by repeats of ''[[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation]]'', and these repeats rated better than first-run episodes of ''Stingers'' (screening a repeat episode of ''CSI'' probably{{Vague|date=December 2007}} costs the network about $25,000 as opposed to a first-run episode of ''Stingers'' at $350,000).\n\nIt became clear what Nine would do: move ''Stingers'' to 10.30pm on a permanent basis and put higher-rating repeats of CSI on at 9.30 p.m. Channel Nine in Adelaide did not like this move and moved ''Stingers'' to 9:30 Monday nights, however this only lasted for five weeks before it was moved back to 10:30 on a Tuesday night; such a move to a later timeslot caused ''Stingers''\u2019 ratings to drop even lower, giving Nine reason to finally end the show. ''Stingers''\u2019 curse seemed to be that it always rated well, but it never rated spectacularly.\n\n==Plot==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2010}}\nInspired by true events, ''Stingers'' chronicled the cases of a deep undercover unit of the Victoria police. The series also followed their personal lives, which sometimes became intertwined with their jobs. The original unit was composed of Senior Detective Peter Church (whose real name was Mike Fischer) played by [[Peter Phelps]], Senior Detective Angie Piper ([[Kate Kendall]]), Constable Oscar Stone (whose real name was Cameron Pierce) played by [[Ian Stenlake]], Det-Sgt. Ellen 'Mac' Mackenzie ([[Anita Hegh]]) and Det-Sen Sgt. Bernie Rocca ([[Joe Petruzzi]]), who led the unit. Rocca was shot and left the unit in season two, and Mac became the new head.\n\nConstable Danni Mayo ([[Roxane Wilson]]) joined the unit in season three, while season five saw two casualties: Stone was killed while Mac ran away with a diamond robber. Detective Inspector Luke Harris ([[Gary Sweet]]) took over as head of the unit until the end of the series, and Danni quit the force after being enraged by him. Constable Christina Dichiera ([[Jacinta Stapleton]]) joined the unit in season six. Her real name is Felicity Matthews, but this was not known to the force, as she had a criminal history under that name. Senior Detective Leo Flynn ([[Daniel Frederiksen]]) joined in season seven.\n\nSeason eight saw the arrival of Detective Katherine Marks, who was revealed as Harris' daughter from his first marriage. The revelation also ended Harris and Angie's already shaky relationship, which had produced a son.\n\n== Episodes ==\n\n===Season One (1998&ndash;99)===\n\n{|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"width:100%; margin:auto;\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"background-color: #449DFB; color: #fffff;\" | Number<br />in series\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"background-color: #449DFB; color: #fffff;\" | Number<br />in season\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"background-color: #449DFB; color: #fffff;\" | Title\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"background-color: #449DFB; color: #fffff;\" | Original air date\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 1\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 1\n| Title           = Ratcatcher \n| OriginalAirDate   = {{Start date|1998|9|29|df=y}}\n| ShortSummary    = When a Homicide investigation into the disappearance of a teenage babysitter fails to reveal any useful evidence, Church and Angie go undercover to infiltrate a sinister criminal family.  \n| LineColor       = 449DFB\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 2\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 2\n| Title           = Hit Me \n| OriginalAirDate   = {{Start date|1998|10|6|df=y}}\n| ShortSummary    = Someone is looking to hire a hitman, so Church goes undercover.

It ran for eight seasons on the [[Nine Network]] before it was canceled in late 2004 due to declining ratings and the late timeslot [[Nine Network|Channel Nine]] gave the program. The series has also aired in 65 countries, including Canada, Denmark, Egypt, France, Gibraltar, Iran, Ireland, Belgium, Luxembourg, Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Turkey, the United Kingdom, the United States and Papua New Guinea. \n\nInspired by true events, ''Stingers'' chronicled the cases of a deep undercover unit of the [[Victoria Police]]. The series also followed their personal lives, which sometimes became intertwined with their jobs. The show received average [[Australian television ratings|rating]]s during its debut season, but after some major changes, including intensive character development, the series became a success the following year. The original cast members include [[Peter Phelps]], Joe Petruzzi, [[Kate Kendall]], [[Ian Stenlake]], [[Anita Hegh]], and [[Jessica Napier]]. Phelps and Kendall were the only actors to remain with the show for its entire run.\n\n==Cast==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2010}}\n* Senior Constable Peter Church \u2013 [[Peter Phelps]] (1998\u20132004, Ep 1 to 192)\n* (Detective) Constable Angie Piper \u2013 [[Kate Kendall]] (1998\u20132004, Ep 1 to 192)\n* Det-Sen Sgt.

Also in attendance was cast member [[Jeremy Kewley]] who posted the following rundown of the discussion for the Stingers forum:\n\n{{cquote|''Stingers'' came about in a very fast manner. John Wild had to get the show from a concept 'jotted down on paper' into a television series in just 11 weeks and in an 8.30pm time slot!}}\n\nIt first began airing up towards the end of the year, on Monday nights. It was up against another new show on [[Seven Network|Channel Seven]], ''[[Ally McBeal]]'', and ''Stingers'' beat ''McBeal'' regularly for its first 11 weeks before it went on its Christmas ratings break. When both shows returned after the ratings break, ''McBeal'' began to win in the ratings quite comfortably, worrying Nine executives.\n\nAt this time Channel Nine and the producers had to work out how to win ratings back, and found that the reason why so many people preferred ''Ally McBeal'' over ''Stingers'' was because ''Stingers'' had a very rough, edgy and realistic feel to it, and that this did not appeal to women of all ages, who preferred the lightness of ''McBeal''. So ''Stingers'' was moved to Tuesday night. This helped a bit, but not enough. Channel Nine were thinking about canceling the show, but Nine owner [[Kerry Packer]] liked the show and suggested that they keep it on the air. Nine did, but moved it an hour later to 9.30pm Tuesdays, and ''Stingers'' started to find its audience (although this was still not a big one). It stayed at this timeslot until the end of 7th season which seemed to be predominately male middle class white collar workers between the ages of 30\u201355.\n\nBy the middle of the second season, ratings were still not spectacular enough and Channel Nine commissioned research which showed that women were not particularly interested in ''Stingers''. As women make up 50% of the audience the producers were told to make the first major change to ''Stingers'': make it more female-friendly. This led to the departure of Joe Petruzzi, making [[Anita Hegh]]'s character the boss of the Unit. This also led to another female character being introduced, undercover operative Danni Mayo, portrayed by [[Roxane Wilson]]. This led to the show becoming more 'lighter' to appeal to the female audiences. Soon after, humour was added to the show, in the form of [[Jeremy Kewley]]'s character, Bryan Gray. These changes worked well and ''Stingers'' steamed through Seasons 3, 4 and 5, but then [[Anita Hegh]] and [[Ian Stenlake]] decided to leave the show, causing another drastic change in the series.\n\nChannel Nine, on a nationwide cost-cutting drive, hinted at dropping the show because ''Stingers''' was considered too expensive; its budget had crept up from its original $440,000-per-episode cost, to around $480,000. They dropped a bombshell on the producers: shave around $130,000 every week from the budget or the show would have to cease production.  A huge ask, but everyone at ''Stingers'' was keen to keep going as everyone felt there were still life in the show and plenty of stories to tell.\n\nBy the start of the next season the budget was chopped down to $350,000 per episode. Shooting changed from six days per episode to five, stock changed from 16&nbsp;mm film to SP Betacam Videotape, the crew became smaller, and writers were given less time to write each episode. The location changed from the \"Crimplex\" (warehouse/studio/offices by the [[Yarra River]]) to the studios of Channel Nine in [[Richmond, Victoria|Richmond]]. Channel Nine spent money on a big new set (plus a new \"hospital ward\" set and a new \"pub/bar\" set) and justified the cost by making sure that most of the action on the show now took place inside the studio on the new sets, with a lot less time spent on locations, with less money spent on car chases, stunts and special effects.\n\nChannel Nine also wanted more \"star power\" in the show, so [[Gary Sweet]] was brought in as Luke Harris (and [[Roxane Wilson]] decided to leave), and [[Rebecca Gibney]] \u2013 now out of a job without ''[[Halifax f.p.]]'' \u2013 was cast for the first few episodes of the new season. Most of these major changes worked quite well, and most viewers at home would not have been too aware of the changes to the visual quality of the show (such as using tape instead of film).\n\nBut, as Executive Producer John Wild humorously pointed out, \"the ratings didn't change one point!\"  Channel Nine commissioned more surveys that told them the show needed to appeal to younger viewers. So two new characters were added, played by [[Daniel Frederiksen]] and [[Jacinta Stapleton]], and, John Wild said, \"and the ratings still didn't change one point!\"  Channel Nine insisted that still more star power was needed to lift the ratings, so [[Lisa Chappell]] (Logie winning ''[[McLeod's Daughters]]'' star) joined the cast. After still no improvement to the ratings, more star power was further added in guest roles with [[Bill Hunter (actor)|Bill Hunter]], [[Gigi Edgley]], [[Steve Bisley]], [[Tottie Goldsmith]].  No improvement still.\n\n''Stingers'' was then \"rested\" for a couple of weeks and replaced by repeats of ''[[CSI: Crime Scene Investigation]]'', and these repeats rated better than first-run episodes of ''Stingers'' (screening a repeat episode of ''CSI'' probably{{Vague|date=December 2007}} costs the network about $25,000 as opposed to a first-run episode of ''Stingers'' at $350,000).\n\nIt became clear what Nine would do: move ''Stingers'' to 10.30pm on a permanent basis and put higher-rating repeats of CSI on at 9.30 p.m. Channel Nine in Adelaide did not like this move and moved ''Stingers'' to 9:30 Monday nights, however this only lasted for five weeks before it was moved back to 10:30 on a Tuesday night; such a move to a later timeslot caused ''Stingers''\u2019 ratings to drop even lower, giving Nine reason to finally end the show. ''Stingers''\u2019 curse seemed to be that it always rated well, but it never rated spectacularly.\n\n==Plot==\n{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2010}}\nInspired by true events, ''Stingers'' chronicled the cases of a deep undercover unit of the Victoria police. The series also followed their personal lives, which sometimes became intertwined with their jobs. The original unit was composed of Senior Detective Peter Church (whose real name was Mike Fischer) played by [[Peter Phelps]], Senior Detective Angie Piper ([[Kate Kendall]]), Constable Oscar Stone (whose real name was Cameron Pierce) played by [[Ian Stenlake]], Det-Sgt. Ellen 'Mac' Mackenzie ([[Anita Hegh]]) and Det-Sen Sgt. Bernie Rocca ([[Joe Petruzzi]]), who led the unit. Rocca was shot and left the unit in season two, and Mac became the new head.\n\nConstable Danni Mayo ([[Roxane Wilson]]) joined the unit in season three, while season five saw two casualties: Stone was killed while Mac ran away with a diamond robber. Detective Inspector Luke Harris ([[Gary Sweet]]) took over as head of the unit until the end of the series, and Danni quit the force after being enraged by him. Constable Christina Dichiera ([[Jacinta Stapleton]]) joined the unit in season six. Her real name is Felicity Matthews, but this was not known to the force, as she had a criminal history under that name. Senior Detective Leo Flynn ([[Daniel Frederiksen]]) joined in season seven.\n\nSeason eight saw the arrival of Detective Katherine Marks, who was revealed as Harris' daughter from his first marriage. The revelation also ended Harris and Angie's already shaky relationship, which had produced a son.\n\n== Episodes ==\n\n===Season One (1998&ndash;99)===\n\n{|class=\"wikitable plainrowheaders\" style=\"width:100%; margin:auto;\"\n|-\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"background-color: #449DFB; color: #fffff;\" | Number<br />in series\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"background-color: #449DFB; color: #fffff;\" | Number<br />in season\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"background-color: #449DFB; color: #fffff;\" | Title\n! scope=\"col\" style=\"background-color: #449DFB; color: #fffff;\" | Original air date\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 1\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 1\n| Title           = Ratcatcher \n| OriginalAirDate   = {{Start date|1998|9|29|df=y}}\n| ShortSummary    = When a Homicide investigation into the disappearance of a teenage babysitter fails to reveal any useful evidence, Church and Angie go undercover to infiltrate a sinister criminal family.  \n| LineColor       = 449DFB\n}}\n{{Episode list\n| EpisodeNumber   = 2\n| EpisodeNumber2  = 2\n| Title           = Hit Me \n| OriginalAirDate   = {{Start date|1998|10|6|df=y}}\n| ShortSummary    = Someone is looking to hire a hitman, so Church goes undercover.
