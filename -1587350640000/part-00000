It is patterned somewhat after the [[United Nations Security Council]]. The PSC is also the main pillar of the [[African Peace and Security Architecture]] (APSA), and works with other pillars of the APSA in order to promote \"peace, security and stability in Africa\" <ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://au.int/en/psc|title=The Peace & Security Council {{!}} African Union|website=au.int|access-date=2020-03-27}}</ref>. The specific goal of the Peace and Security Council (PSC) is the \"prevention, management and resolution of conflicts\" <ref name=\":0\" />. To achieve these goals, it involves subsidiary organizations such as the Military Staff Committee and the Committee of Experts. \n\nMembers are elected by the African Union Executive Council and endorsed by the Assembly of the African Union so as to reflect regional balance within [[Africa]], as well as a variety of other criteria, including capacity to contribute militarily and financially to the union, political will to do so, and effective diplomatic presence at [[Addis Ababa]] <ref name=\":0\" />. \n\nThe council is composed of fifteen countries, of which five are elected to three-year terms, and ten to two-year terms. Countries are immediately re-eligible upon the expiration of their terms.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Background ===\nIn the early 1990s, members of the [[Organisation of African Unity|Organization of African Unity]] (OAU), the predecessor to the [[African Union]] (AU), decided to abstain from active peacekeeping operations and focus instead on \"preventive diplomacy\"  <ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Williams|first=Paul D.|date=2009-11-12|title=The Peace and Security Council of the African Union: evaluating an embryonic international institution|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/s0022278x09990048|journal=The Journal of Modern African Studies|volume=47|issue=4|pages=603\u2013626|doi=10.1017/s0022278x09990048|issn=0022-278X}}</ref>. However, they reevaluated their stances after conflicts in [[Rwandan genocide|Rwanda]] and [[Burundian genocides|Burundi]] <ref name=\":1\" />.\n\nIn 1995, members of the OAU started to support the use of peacekeeping operations after a summit in Addis Ababa. However, the OAU still prioritized preventive diplomacy and believed that the [[United Nations]] should shoulder most of the responsibility for organizing peacekeeping operations <ref name=\":1\" />.\n\nLater conflicts in Africa were largely mediated by African institutions rather than the UN. For example, conflicts in [[Liberia]] and [[Sierra Leone]] were addressed by the [[Economic Community of West African States]]. Similarly, conflicts in [[Lesotho]] and the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Democratic Republic of Congo]] were addressed by the [[Southern African Development Community]] <ref name=\":1\" />.\n\nThese sub-regional organizations' large role in addressing regional conflicts led to a debate about the effectiveness of the OAU. Members specifically wished to reform the OAU's focus on consensus-based meetings rather than on-the-ground action, since some conflicts' actors were part of the meetings and could interfere with their judgement. Similarly, the large size of the OAU, its [[consensus decision-making]] and its lack of clear procedures both obstructed constructive debate <ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Powell|first=Kristiana|last2=Tieku|first2=Thomas Kwasi|date=2005|title=The African Union's New Security Agenda: Is Africa Closer to a Pax Pan-Africana?|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/40204092|journal=International Journal|volume=60|issue=4|pages=937\u2013952|doi=10.2307/40204092|issn=0020-7020}}</ref>.

It is patterned somewhat after the [[United Nations Security Council]]. The PSC is also the main pillar of the [[African Peace and Security Architecture]] (APSA), and works with other pillars of the APSA in order to promote \"peace, security and stability in Africa\" <ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=https://au.int/en/psc|title=The Peace & Security Council {{!}} African Union|website=au.int|access-date=2020-03-27}}</ref>. The specific goal of the Peace and Security Council (PSC) is the \"prevention, management and resolution of conflicts\" <ref name=\":0\" />. To achieve these goals, it involves subsidiary organizations such as the Military Staff Committee and the Committee of Experts. \n\nMembers are elected by the African Union Executive Council and endorsed by the Assembly of the African Union so as to reflect regional balance within [[Africa]], as well as a variety of other criteria, including capacity to contribute militarily and financially to the union, political will to do so, and effective diplomatic presence at [[Addis Ababa]] <ref name=\":0\" />. \n\nThe council is composed of fifteen countries, of which five are elected to three-year terms, and ten to two-year terms. Countries are immediately re-eligible upon the expiration of their terms.\n\n== History ==\n\n=== Background ===\nIn the early 1990s, members of the [[Organisation of African Unity|Organization of African Unity]] (OAU), the predecessor to the [[African Union]] (AU), decided to abstain from active peacekeeping operations and focus instead on \"preventive diplomacy\"  <ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Williams|first=Paul D.|date=2009-11-12|title=The Peace and Security Council of the African Union: evaluating an embryonic international institution|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1017/s0022278x09990048|journal=The Journal of Modern African Studies|volume=47|issue=4|pages=603\u2013626|doi=10.1017/s0022278x09990048|issn=0022-278X}}</ref>. However, they reevaluated their stances after conflicts in [[Rwandan genocide|Rwanda]] and [[Burundian genocides|Burundi]] <ref name=\":1\" />.\n\nIn 1995, members of the OAU started to support the use of peacekeeping operations after a summit in Addis Ababa. However, the OAU still prioritized preventive diplomacy and believed that the [[United Nations]] should shoulder most of the responsibility for organizing peacekeeping operations <ref name=\":1\" />.\n\nLater conflicts in Africa were largely mediated by African institutions rather than the UN. For example, conflicts in [[Liberia]] and [[Sierra Leone]] were addressed by the [[Economic Community of West African States]]. Similarly, conflicts in [[Lesotho]] and the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Democratic Republic of Congo]] were addressed by the [[Southern African Development Community]] <ref name=\":1\" />.\n\nThese sub-regional organizations' large role in addressing regional conflicts led to a debate about the effectiveness of the OAU. Members specifically wished to reform the OAU's focus on consensus-based meetings rather than on-the-ground action, since some conflicts' actors were part of the meetings and could interfere with their judgement. Similarly, the large size of the OAU, its [[consensus decision-making]] and its lack of clear procedures both obstructed constructive debate <ref name=\":1\" /><ref name=\":3\">{{Cite journal|last=Powell|first=Kristiana|last2=Tieku|first2=Thomas Kwasi|date=2005|title=The African Union's New Security Agenda: Is Africa Closer to a Pax Pan-Africana?|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/40204092|journal=International Journal|volume=60|issue=4|pages=937\u2013952|doi=10.2307/40204092|issn=0020-7020}}</ref>.

But a new crisis erupted in 2012-2013, when S\u00e9l\u00e9ka forces seized the capital Bangui.  In response, on 19 July 2013, the AU Peace and Security Council approved the deployment of MISCA. The transfer of authority between ECCAS/MICOPAX and the AU/MISCA mission took place on 19 December 2013.  The mission ended with the transfer of authority from MISCA to the UN mission MINUSCA on 15 September 2014.<ref>African Union, Peace and Security Council, https://au.int/en/organs/psc, accessed 31 January 2018.</ref>\n\n\n(11) [[Multinational Joint Task Force]] (MNJTF) \u2013 2015 to present\n\n\n(12)  Regional Protection Force - 2017 to present\n\nDuring July 2016 the AU agreed to a Regional Protection Force to bolster the UN mission in South Sudan, similar to the [[United Nations Force Intervention Brigade]] role with the MONUSCO mission in the Democratic Republic of the Congo<ref>Aglietti, S.
