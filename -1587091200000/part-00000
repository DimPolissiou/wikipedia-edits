generations of the iPhone use Apple's [[iOS]] mobile operating system software. The [[iPhone (1st generation)|first-generation iPhone]] was released on June 29, 2007, and multiple new hardware iterations with new iOS releases have been released since.\n\nThe [[user interface]] is built around the device's [[multi-touch]] screen, including a [[virtual keyboard]]. The iPhone has [[Wi-Fi]] and can connect to [[cellular network]]s. An iPhone can [[camera phone|take photos]], [[portable media player|play music]], send and receive [[email|emails]], [[web browser|browse the web]], send and receive [[text messaging|text messages]], record notes, perform mathematical calculations, and receive [[visual voicemail]]. [[video camera|Shooting video]] also became a standard feature with the [[iPhone 3GS]]. Other functionality, such as video games, reference works, and social networking, can be enabled by downloading [[mobile app]]s. {{As of|2017|1}}, Apple's [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]] contained more than 2.2&nbsp;million applications available for the iPhone.\n\nApple has released thirteen [[Comparison of Apple iPhone|generations]] of iPhone models, each accompanied by one of the thirteen major releases of the [[iOS]] operating system. The [[IPhone (1st generation)|first-generation iPhone]] was a [[GSM]] phone and established design precedents, such as a placement of certain buttons that has persisted throughout all releases to date. The first iPhone also set a screen size that was maintained for the next four iterations. The [[iPhone 3G]] added [[3G]] network support and was followed by the [[iPhone 3GS]] with improved hardware, the [[iPhone 4]] with a metal chassis, higher display resolution, and front-facing camera, and the [[iPhone 4S]] with improved hardware and the voice assistant [[Siri]]. The [[iPhone 5]] featured a taller, {{convert|4|in|mm}} display and Apple's newly introduced [[Lightning (connector)|Lightning connector]]. In 2013, Apple released the [[iPhone 5S]] with improved hardware and a [[Touch ID|fingerprint reader]] (marketed as 'Touch ID'), and the lower-cost [[iPhone 5C]], a version of the 5 with a plastic body, instead of metal one. The 5C was also available in many colors. They were followed by the larger [[iPhone 6|iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus]], with models featuring {{convert|4.7|and|5.5|in|mm|adj=on}} displays. The [[iPhone 6S]] was introduced the following year, which featured hardware upgrades and support for [[3D Touch|pressure-sensitive touch inputs]], as well as the [[iPhone SE (1st generation)|iPhone SE]]\u2014which featured hardware from the 6S but the smaller form factor of the 5S. In 2016, Apple unveiled the [[iPhone 7|iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus]], which add water resistance, improved system, and graphics performance, a new rear dual-camera setup on the Plus model, and new color options, while removing the 3.5&nbsp;mm headphone jack found on previous models. The [[iPhone 8|iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus]] were released in 2017, adding a glass back and an improved screen and camera. The [[iPhone X]] was released alongside the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus, with its highlights being a near bezel-less design, an improved camera, and a new facial recognition system, named [[Face ID]], but having no home button, and therefore, no [[Touch ID]]. In September 2018, Apple released 3 new iPhones, which are the [[iPhone XS]], an upgraded version of the since discontinued iPhone X, [[iPhone XS Max]], a larger variant with the series' biggest display {{as of|2018|lc=y}} and [[iPhone XR]], a lower-end version of the iPhone X. On September 10, 2019, Apple again released 3 new iPhones, which are [[iPhone 11 Pro]], [[iPhone 11 Pro Max]], and the lower-end [[iPhone 11]]. On April 15, 2020, Apple announced the second-generation [[iPhone SE (2nd generation)|iPhone SE]] as a successor to both the original iPhone SE and the iPhone 8, featuring hardware from the 11 and 11 Pro in a design nearly identical to the iPhone 8.\n\nThe first-generation iPhone was described as \"revolutionary\" and a \"game-changer\" for the mobile phone industry. Subsequent iterations of the iPhone have also garnered praise. The iPhone is one of the most widely used smartphones in the world, and its success has been credited with helping Apple become one of the world's [[List of public corporations by market capitalization|most valuable publicly traded companies]].\n\nAs of November 1, 2018, more than 2.2 billion iPhones had been sold.<ref name=\"Lifewire\"/>\n\n==History and

A CDMA-activated iPhone 4S usually has a carrier-approved roaming SIM preloaded in its SIM slot at the time of purchase that is used for roaming on certain carrier-approved international GSM networks only.

Starting with the iPhone 4, a primitive version of multitasking came into play. Users could double click the home button to select recently opened applications.<ref>applications</ref> However, the apps never ran in the background. Starting with iOS 7, though, apps can truly multitask, and each open application runs in the background when not in use, although most functionality is still available when making a call or listening to music. The home screen can be accessed by a hardware button below the screen on the iPhone 8 and earlier. iPhone X and later models require that you swipe up.\n\nThe original iPhone contained the following apps: Messages ([[Short Message Service|SMS]] and [[Multimedia Messaging Service|MMS]] messaging), Calendar, Photos, Camera, YouTube, Stocks, Maps ([[Google Maps]]), Weather, Voice Memos, Notes, Clock, Calculator, Settings and [[iTunes Store|iTunes (store)]]. The [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]] was introduced in iPhone OS 2 for the original iPhone and iPhone 3G. [[Compass]] was added in iPhone OS 3 for the iPhone 3GS. FaceTime and Game Center were added in iOS 4 and 4.1 respectively. In iOS 5, Reminders and Newsstand were added, and the iPod application was split into separate Music and Videos applications. iOS 6 added Passbook as well as a new version of Maps called Apple Maps that relies on data provided by TomTom as well as other sources, and YouTube no longer came as a pre-installed application starting from that version. iOS 7 introduced a modern flat design for the interface and added a motion-based parallax feature to give the device a quasi-3D effect. iOS 8 added Health app. iOS 9 replaced Newsstand and Passbook with [[Apple News|News]] and [[Apple Wallet|Wallet]]. iOS 10 introduces Home and dedicated a page on the home screen for the widgets. iOS 11 added Files. iOS 12 introduces Measure, an app that uses [[Augmented reality|AR]] technology to measure objects and things. It is available on devices with an [[Apple A9|A9]] chip or newer.\n\nDocked at the base of the screen, four icons for [[Mobile phone|Phone]], [[Email|Mail]], [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]] (Internet), and Music delineate the iPhone's main purposes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=306003|title=iPhone Applications|publisher=Apple Inc.|date=July 11, 2007|accessdate=November 4, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080311142319/http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=306003|archive-date=March 11, 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref> On January 15, 2008, Apple released software update 1.1.3, allowing users to create \"Web Clips\", home screen icons that resemble apps that open a user-defined page in Safari. After the update, iPhone users can rearrange and place icons (by holding down on any icon and moving it to the desired location once they start shaking) on up to nine other adjacent home screens, accessed by a horizontal swipe.<ref name=\"Update 1.1.3\">{{cite press release|url=https://www.apple.com/pr/library/2008/01/15iphone.html|title=Apple Enhances Revolutionary iPhone with Software Update|date=January 15, 2008|publisher=Apple Inc.|accessdate=December 13, 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081215230427/http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2008/01/15iphone.html|archivedate=December 15, 2008|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nUsers can also add and delete icons from the dock, which is the same on every home screen. The dock holds up to four icons and is located at the bottom section of the screen. Each home screen holds up to twenty icons for the [[iPhone (1st generation)|first-generation iPhone]], [[iPhone 3G|3G]], [[iPhone 4|4]] and [[iPhone 4S|4S]]; The [[iPhone 5]], [[iPhone 5C|5C]], [[iPhone 5S|5S]], and [[iPhone SE (1st generation)|SE (1st)]] hold up to twenty-four icons; while the [[iPhone 6]] and later iPhone models support up to twenty-eight icons. Users can delete Web Clips and third-party applications at any time and may select only certain applications for transfer from iTunes. Apple's default programs could only be removed since the iOS 10 update. The 3.0 update adds a system-wide search, known as [[Spotlight (software)#iOS|Spotlight]], to the left of the first home screen.<ref name=\"3.0 official\"/><ref name=\"3.0 Macworld\"/>\n\nAlmost all input is given through the touch screen, which understands complex gestures using [[multi-touch]]. The iPhone's [[interaction technique]]s enable the user to move the content up or down by a touch-drag motion of the finger. For example, zooming in and out of web pages and photos is done by placing two fingers on the screen and spreading them farther apart or bringing them closer together, a gesture known as \"[[pinching (technology)|pinching]]\".\n\nScrolling through a long list or menu is achieved by sliding a finger over the display from bottom to top, or vice versa to go back. In either case, the list moves as if it is pasted on the outer surface of a wheel, slowly decelerating as if affected by friction. In this way, the interface [[Physics engine|simulates the physics]] of a real object. Unlike previous scrollable views, in which the user pressed a \"down\" control to move the view \"downwards\", on iOS the user pushes ''upwards'', as if moving a \"plank of wood floating on the water\", creating the impression that the user is directly manipulating the content displayed on the screen.<ref name=\"Siracusa Frontier\">{{cite web|last1=Siracusa|first1=John|title=The Frontier|url=https://arstechnica.com/staff/2007/06/the-frontier/|website=Ars Technica|accessdate=August 1, 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"Apple's Mousetrap\">{{cite web|last1=Agger|first1=Michael|title=Apple's Mousetrap|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2011/09/apples_mousetrap.html|website=Slate|accessdate=August 1, 2017}}</ref>\n\nOther [[User-centered design|user-centered]] [[interactive design|interactive]] effects include horizontally sliding sub-selection, the vertically sliding keyboard and bookmarks menu, and widgets that turn around to allow settings to be configured on the other side. Menu bars are found at the top and bottom of the screen when necessary. Their options vary by program but always follow a consistent style motif. In menu hierarchies, a \"back\" button in the top-left corner of the screen displays the name of the parent folder.\n\n===Phone===\n[[File:IPhone calling screen.png|thumb|upright|When making a call, the iPhone presents a number of options, including [[FaceTime]] on supported models.

On December 18, 2012, IGB launched its own line of Android smartphones under the tradename to which it has exclusive rights in the local market.<ref name=reuters-2012/> In February 2013, the Brazilian Patent and Trademark Office (known as \"Instituto Nacional da Propriedade Industrial\") issued a ruling that Gradiente Eletr\u00f4nica, not Apple, owned the \"iPhone\" mark in Brazil. The \"iPhone\" term was registered by Gradiente in 2000, 7 years before Apple's release of its first iPhone. This decision came three months after Gradiente Eletr\u00f4nica launched a lower-cost smartphone using the iPhone brand.<ref>{{cite news|last=Vergara del Carril|first=Marcos|title=Apple is Fighting Back in Brazilian Courts to Get its iPhone Trademark|url=http://www.natlawreview.com/article/apple-fighting-back-brazilian-courts-to-get-its-iphone-trademark|accessdate=November 6, 2013|newspaper=[[National Law Review]]|date=October 11, 2013|author2=Sheppard, Mullin, Richter & Hampton LLP}}</ref>\n\nIn June 2014, Apple won, for the second time, the right to use the brand name in Brazil.

Apple later filed a trademark case at the Intellectual Property Office of the Philippines (IPOPHL) against Solid Broadband's MyPhone for \"confusingly similar\" to the iPhone and that it may likely \"deceive\" or \"cause confusion\" among consumers.\n\nApple lost the trademark battle to Solid Group in a 2015 decision made by IPO director Nathaniel Arevalo, who also reportedly said that it was unlikely that consumers would be confused between the \"iPhone\" and the \"MyPhone\". \"This is a case of a giant trying to claim more territory than what it is entitled to, to the great prejudice of a local 'Pinoy Phone' merchant who has managed to obtain a significant foothold in the mobile phone market through the marketing and sale of innovative products under a very distinctive trademark\",

generations of the iPhone use Apple's [[iOS]] mobile operating system software. The [[iPhone (1st generation)|first-generation iPhone]] was released on June 29, 2007, and multiple new hardware iterations with new iOS releases have been released since.\n\nThe [[user interface]] is built around the device's [[multi-touch]] screen, including a [[virtual keyboard]]. The iPhone has [[Wi-Fi]] and can connect to [[cellular network]]s. An iPhone can [[camera phone|take photos]], [[portable media player|play music]], send and receive [[email|emails]], [[web browser|browse the web]], send and receive [[text messaging|text messages]], record notes, perform mathematical calculations, and receive [[visual voicemail]]. [[video camera|Shooting video]] also became a standard feature with the [[iPhone 3GS]]. Other functionality, such as video games, reference works, and social networking, can be enabled by downloading [[mobile app]]s. {{As of|2017|1}}, Apple's [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]] contained more than 2.2&nbsp;million applications available for the iPhone.\n\nApple has released thirteen [[Comparison of Apple iPhone|generations]] of iPhone models, each accompanied by one of the thirteen major releases of the [[iOS]] operating system. The [[IPhone (1st generation)|first-generation iPhone]] was a [[GSM]] phone and established design precedents, such as a placement of certain buttons that has persisted throughout all releases to date. The first iPhone also set a screen size that was maintained for the next four iterations. The [[iPhone 3G]] added [[3G]] network support and was followed by the [[iPhone 3GS]] with improved hardware, the [[iPhone 4]] with a metal chassis, higher display resolution, and front-facing camera, and the [[iPhone 4S]] with improved hardware and the voice assistant [[Siri]]. The [[iPhone 5]] featured a taller, {{convert|4|in|mm}} display and Apple's newly introduced [[Lightning (connector)|Lightning connector]]. In 2013, Apple released the [[iPhone 5S]] with improved hardware and a [[Touch ID|fingerprint reader]] (marketed as 'Touch ID'), and the lower-cost [[iPhone 5C]], a version of the 5 with a plastic body, instead of metal one. The 5C was also available in many colors. They were followed by the larger [[iPhone 6|iPhone 6 and iPhone 6 Plus]], with models featuring {{convert|4.7|and|5.5|in|mm|adj=on}} displays. The [[iPhone 6S]] was introduced the following year, which featured hardware upgrades and support for [[3D Touch|pressure-sensitive touch inputs]], as well as the [[iPhone SE (1st generation)|iPhone SE]]\u2014which featured hardware from the 6S but the smaller form factor of the 5S. In 2016, Apple unveiled the [[iPhone 7|iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus]], which add water resistance, improved system, and graphics performance, a new rear dual-camera setup on the Plus model, and new color options, while removing the 3.5&nbsp;mm headphone jack found on previous models. The [[iPhone 8|iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus]] were released in 2017, adding a glass back and an improved screen and camera. The [[iPhone X]] was released alongside the iPhone 8 and iPhone 8 Plus, with its highlights being a near bezel-less design, an improved camera, and a new facial recognition system, named [[Face ID]], but having no home button, and therefore, no [[Touch ID]]. In September 2018, Apple released 3 new iPhones, which are the [[iPhone XS]], an upgraded version of the since discontinued iPhone X, [[iPhone XS Max]], a larger variant with the series' biggest display {{as of|2018|lc=y}} and [[iPhone XR]], a lower-end version of the iPhone X. On September 10, 2019, Apple again released 3 new iPhones, which are [[iPhone 11 Pro]], [[iPhone 11 Pro Max]], and the lower-end [[iPhone 11]]. On April 15, 2020, Apple announced the second-generation [[iPhone SE (2nd generation)|iPhone SE]] as a successor to both the original iPhone SE and the iPhone 8, featuring hardware from the 11 and 11 Pro in a design nearly identical to the iPhone 8.\n\nThe first-generation iPhone was described as \"revolutionary\" and a \"game-changer\" for the mobile phone industry. Subsequent iterations of the iPhone have also garnered praise. The iPhone is one of the most widely used smartphones in the world, and its success has been credited with helping Apple become one of the world's [[List of public corporations by market capitalization|most valuable publicly traded companies]].\n\nAs of November 1, 2018, more than 2.2 billion iPhones had been sold.<ref name=\"Lifewire\"/>\n\n==History and

Starting with iOS 7, though, apps can truly multitask, and each open application runs in the background when not in use, although most functionality is still available when making a call or listening to music. The home screen can be accessed by a hardware button below the screen on the iPhone 8 and earlier. iPhone X and later models require that you swipe up.\n\nThe original iPhone contained the following apps: Messages ([[Short Message Service|SMS]] and [[Multimedia Messaging Service|MMS]] messaging), Calendar, Photos, Camera, YouTube, Stocks, Maps ([[Google Maps]]), Weather, Voice Memos, Notes, Clock, Calculator, Settings and [[iTunes Store|iTunes (store)]]. The [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]] was introduced in iPhone OS 2 for the original iPhone and iPhone 3G. [[Compass]] was added in iPhone OS 3 for the iPhone 3GS. FaceTime and Game Center were added in iOS 4 and 4.1 respectively. In iOS 5, Reminders and Newsstand were added, and the iPod application was split into separate Music and Videos applications. iOS 6 added Passbook as well as a new version of Maps called Apple Maps that relies on data provided by TomTom as well as other sources, and YouTube no longer came as a pre-installed application starting from that version. iOS 7 introduced a modern flat design for the interface and added a motion-based parallax feature to give the device a quasi-3D effect. iOS 8 added Health app. iOS 9 replaced Newsstand and Passbook with [[Apple News|News]] and [[Apple Wallet|Wallet]]. iOS 10 introduces Home and dedicated a page on the home screen for the widgets. iOS 11 added Files. iOS 12 introduces Measure, an app that uses [[Augmented reality|AR]] technology to measure objects and things. It is available on devices with an [[Apple A9|A9]] chip or newer.\n\nDocked at the base of the screen, four icons for [[Mobile phone|Phone]], [[Email|Mail]], [[Safari (web browser)|Safari]] (Internet), and Music delineate the iPhone's main purposes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=306003|title=iPhone Applications|publisher=Apple Inc.|date=July 11, 2007|accessdate=November 4, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080311142319/http://docs.info.apple.com/article.html?artnum=306003|archive-date=March 11, 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref> On January 15, 2008, Apple released software update 1.1.3, allowing users to create \"Web Clips\", home screen icons that resemble apps that open a user-defined page in Safari. After the update, iPhone users can rearrange and place icons (by holding down on any icon and moving it to the desired location once they start shaking) on up to nine other adjacent home screens, accessed by a horizontal swipe.<ref name=\"Update 1.1.3\">{{cite press release|url=https://www.apple.com/pr/library/2008/01/15iphone.html|title=Apple Enhances Revolutionary iPhone with Software Update|date=January 15, 2008|publisher=Apple Inc.|accessdate=December 13, 2008|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081215230427/http://www.apple.com/pr/library/2008/01/15iphone.html|archivedate=December 15, 2008|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nUsers can also add and delete icons from the dock, which is the same on every home screen. The dock holds up to four icons and is located at the bottom section of the screen. Each home screen holds up to twenty icons for the [[iPhone (1st generation)|first-generation iPhone]], [[iPhone 3G|3G]], [[iPhone 4|4]] and [[iPhone 4S|4S]]; The [[iPhone 5]], [[iPhone 5C|5C]], [[iPhone 5S|5S]], and [[iPhone SE (1st generation)|SE (1st)]] hold up to twenty-four icons; while the [[iPhone 6]] and later iPhone models support up to twenty-eight icons. Users can delete Web Clips and third-party applications at any time and may select only certain applications for transfer from iTunes. Apple's default programs could only be removed since the iOS 10 update. The 3.0 update adds a system-wide search, known as [[Spotlight (software)#iOS|Spotlight]], to the left of the first home screen.<ref name=\"3.0 official\"/><ref name=\"3.0 Macworld\"/>\n\nAlmost all input is given through the touch screen, which understands complex gestures using [[multi-touch]]. The iPhone's [[interaction technique]]s enable the user to move the content up or down by a touch-drag motion of the finger. For example, zooming in and out of web pages and photos is done by placing two fingers on the screen and spreading them farther apart or bringing them closer together, a gesture known as \"[[pinching (technology)|pinching]]\".\n\nScrolling through a long list or menu is achieved by sliding a finger over the display from bottom to top, or vice versa to go back. In either case, the list moves as if it is pasted on the outer surface of a wheel, slowly decelerating as if affected by friction. In this way, the interface [[Physics engine|simulates the physics]] of a real object. Unlike previous scrollable views, in which the user pressed a \"down\" control to move the view \"downwards\", on iOS the user pushes ''upwards'', as if moving a \"plank of wood floating on the water\", creating the impression that the user is directly manipulating the content displayed on the screen.<ref name=\"Siracusa Frontier\">{{cite web|last1=Siracusa|first1=John|title=The Frontier|url=https://arstechnica.com/staff/2007/06/the-frontier/|website=Ars Technica|accessdate=August 1, 2017}}</ref><ref name=\"Apple's Mousetrap\">{{cite web|last1=Agger|first1=Michael|title=Apple's Mousetrap|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/technology/technology/2011/09/apples_mousetrap.html|website=Slate|accessdate=August 1, 2017}}</ref>\n\nOther [[User-centered design|user-centered]] [[interactive design|interactive]] effects include horizontally sliding sub-selection, the vertically sliding keyboard and bookmarks menu, and widgets that turn around to allow settings to be configured on the other side. Menu bars are found at the top and bottom of the screen when necessary. Their options vary by program but always follow a consistent style motif. In menu hierarchies, a \"back\" button in the top-left corner of the screen displays the name of the parent folder.\n\n===Phone===\n[[File:IPhone calling screen.png|thumb|upright|When making a call, the iPhone presents a number of options, including [[FaceTime]] on supported models. The screen is [[Proximity sensor|automatically disabled]] when held close to the face.]]\nThe iPhone allows audio [[conference call|conferencing]], call holding, call merging, [[caller ID]], and integration with other cellular network features and iPhone functions. For example, if music is playing when a call is received, the music fades out and fades back in when the call has ended.\n\nThe [[proximity sensor]] shuts off the screen and touch-sensitive circuitry when the iPhone is brought close to the face, both to save battery and prevent unintentional touches.

The user can reply with a message, or set a reminder to call them back at a later time.<ref>{{cite web|title=iOS 6 Preview|url=https://www.apple.com/ios/ios6/|publisher=Apple Inc.|accessdate=June 11, 2012}}</ref>\n\n===Multimedia===\nThe layout of the music library is similar to that of an [[iPod]]. The iPhone can sort its media library by songs, artists, albums, videos, [[playlist]]s, [[genre]]s, composers, [[podcast]]s, [[audiobook]]s, and [[Compilation album|compilations]]. Options are presented alphabetically, except in playlists, which retain their order from [[iTunes]]. The iPhone uses a large font that allows users plenty of room to touch their selection.\n\nUsers can rotate their device horizontally to [[Page orientation|landscape mode]] to access [[Cover Flow]]. Like on iTunes, this feature shows the different album covers in a scroll-through photo library. Scrolling is achieved by swiping a finger across the screen. Alternatively, headset controls can be used to pause, play, skip, and repeat tracks. On the iPhone 3GS, the volume can be changed with the included Apple Earphones, and the Voice Control feature can be used to identify a track, play songs in a playlist or by a specific artist, or create a [[Genius (iTunes)|Genius playlist]].<ref name=\"Voice_Control\"/>\n\nThe iPhone supports [[gapless playback]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1797 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080508053830/http://support.apple.com/kb/HT1797 |url-status=dead |archive-date=May 8, 2008 |title=What is Gapless Playback? |accessdate=May 13, 2008 |publisher=Apple Inc. |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Like the [[iPod classic#Fifth generation|fifth-generation iPods]] introduced in 2005, the iPhone can play [[digital video]], allowing users to watch TV shows and movies in [[widescreen]]. Double-tapping switches between widescreen and [[4:3|fullscreen]] video playback.\n\nThe iPhone allows users to purchase and download songs from the iTunes Store directly to their iPhone.

The user zooms in and out of photos by sliding two fingers further apart or closer together, much like Safari. The camera application also lets users view the camera roll, the pictures that have been taken with the iPhone's camera.

The user can choose to have a standard view or zoomed view. When the iPhone is placed in a standard view setting, the icons are normal size and the text remains the same. With a zoomed view option, the icons on the screen and the text become slightly larger. This enables the user to have a more customized appearance and it can potentially help some users read the screen easier.\n\nAssistiveTouch helps to adapt the [[Multi-touch|Multi-Touch]] screen of an iOS device to a user's unique physical needs. This can be of great assistance to those who have difficulty with some gestures, like pinch, one can make them accessible with just a tap of a finger. The user can create their own gestures and customize the layout of the AssistiveTouch menu. If the user has trouble pressing the Home button, it can be set so that it can be activated with an onscreen tap. Gestures, like rotate and shake, are available even when if the iOS device is mounted on a [[wheelchair]].<ref name=\"Accessibility \u2013 iOS \u2013 Apple\"/>\n\nGuided Access helps people with [[autism]] or other [[Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder|attention]] and [[Sensory processing disorder|sensory challenges]] stay focused on the task (or app) at hand. With Guided Access, a parent, teacher, or therapist can limit an iOS device to stay on one app by disabling the Home button and limit the amount of time spent in an app. The user can restrict access to the keyboard or touch input on certain areas of the screen.\n\nIn 2019 Apple began developing satellites so that the iPhone could skip wireless carriers.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Axon |first1=Samuel |title=Report: Apple is developing satellites so the iPhone can skip wireless carriers |url=https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2019/12/report-apple-is-developing-satellites-so-the-iphone-can-skip-wireless-carriers/?bxid=5be9fceb2ddf9c72dc8994b7&cndid=30462369 |website=Ars Technica |accessdate=26 December 2019 |language=en-us |date=20 December 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Models==\n{{See also|List of iOS devices#iPhone}}\n24 different iPhone models have been produced.

Police officers such as [[Rahul Sharma (Gujarat police)|Rahul Sharma]] that did not fall into line were transferred.{{sfn|Bunsha|2005|p=55}}  Togadia and VHP/BJP activists also interfered with the treatment of victims in hospitals, telling doctors whom to treat and whom to turn away.{{sfn|Bunsha|2005|p=94}}  Togadia hailed the conduct of the riots as the \"Hindutva laboratory\" and said that it will be replicated in Delhi.  \"A Hindu Rashtra can be expected in the next two years... We will change India's history and Pakistan's geography by then,\" he said.{{sfn|Bunsha|2005|pp=12,25}} In the December 2002 elections to the Gujarat Assembly, Togadia campaigned for BJP enthusiastically, addressing more than 100 rallies.<ref name=Modi/>\n\nAfter the December 2002 elections, however, Modi dropped Zadafia from his council of ministers, signaling to Togadia that his interference in government would not be welcome.  Modi's biographer Andy Marino states that, while Modi took the blame for the 2002 riots, he knew the culpability of Togadia and the VHP.  Togadia is reported to have complained after the elections that Modi was garnering all the \"credit\" for the riots whereas it was his men that did all the killing.{{sfn|Nag|2013|p=13}}{{sfn|Marino|2014|p=165}}  During his second term of office, Modi took action against VHP interests and activists, both out of his own initiative as well as due to pressure from the Supreme court. \nTogadia in turn ridiculed Modi's efforts to reach out to Muslims through his ''sadbhavana'' initiatives. The influence of Togadia and the VHP in Gujarat fell steeply.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nGordhan Zadaphia subsequently floated a new political party, Mahagujarat Janata Party (MJP) during the 2007 assembly elections in Gujarat, later merged into the [[Gujarat Parivartan Party]] (GPP) of former chief minister Keshubhai Patel. During the 2012 assembly elections, Togadia and VHP activists campaigned hard for the Gujarat Parivartan Party against the BJP.  Despite all efforts, Zadaphia and his whole team lost the 2012 elections.

The Manica province is divided into nine districts and 34 administrative regions.\n\n==History==\nThe province was the part of ancient [[Manica kingdom]].{{sfn|Briggs|2014|p=209}} In 8th century the province came under the control of Munhumutapa Empire and had commercial relations with Arab-Swahili traders in the coastal regions. Later it came under the Portuguese influence. The territory of the current province was part of the grant of the [[Mozambique Company]], established in 1891. With the reversal of the territory for direct Portuguese colonial administration in 1942, the \"District of Beira\" was established, which came to be known as the \"District of Manica and Sofala\" in 1947. On 5 August 1970 this district was divided into \"District Vila Pery\" (the old name of Chimoio) and \"District of Sofala\". During the period of the transitional government (7 September 1974 to 25 June 1975) the District of Vila Pery was renamed \"Province of Vila Pery\" and later to its present name.{{sfn|Derman|Kaarhus|2013|p=71}} In 2008, when the incumbent president of Zimbabwe, [[Robert Mugabe]] lost the first round of the presidential elections, violence broke out in the country.

It was arrogant to think we could build a mirror image of ourselves in foreign lands. [The boys\u2019 deaths] underscored the gap between our aims and reality. The two boys who perished were bystanders in this larger struggle. I was humbled and chastened by this experience. War is a miserable enterprise.

And that the environment serves the community, which means they need to make the decisions about it. In a recent controversy about a proposed dredging of an estuary, Hastie said: <blockquote>\"I believe in the sovereignty of local communities to make decisions about how they conserve and develop their environment. The Bindjareb people, the First Australians in my constituency, have long been custodians of the waterways\u2014for many generations back to the present. The Murray Mandurah community also shares this responsibility, and together we are all stewards of the beautiful Peel-Harvey Estuary, a body of water larger than Sydney Harbour, teeming with marine life and brimming with natural beauty. We, therefore, through our local governments, have sovereignty over this natural asset and should have a say about how development takes place. We're not antiprogress, but we are rightly cautious about development, as we are the ones most affected by it.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.openaustralia.org.au/debates/?id=2019-09-11.151.1&s=speaker:10843#g151.2|title=Peel-Harvey Estuary: 11 Sep 2019: House debates (OpenAustralia.org)|website=www.openaustralia.org.au|access-date=2019-12-18}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Personal life==\n[[File:AH with family (KN).jpg|thumb|Ruth and Andrew Hastie with their children in Mandurah, October 2018]]\nHastie met his wife Ruth in the summer of 2007 while he was studying at [[George Washington University]].

And that the environment serves the community, which means they need to make the decisions about it. In a recent controversy about a proposed dredging of an estuary, Hastie said: <blockquote>\"I believe in the sovereignty of local communities to make decisions about how they conserve and develop their environment. The Bindjareb people, the First Australians in my constituency, have long been custodians of the waterways\u2014for many generations back to the present. The Murray Mandurah community also shares this responsibility, and together we are all stewards of the beautiful Peel-Harvey Estuary, a body of water larger than Sydney Harbour, teeming with marine life and brimming with natural beauty. We, therefore, through our local governments, have sovereignty over this natural asset and should have a say about how development takes place.
