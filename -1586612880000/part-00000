The name derives from the section of Gasheads who stood in the Tote End terrace at Rovers' old home, [[Eastville Stadium]].\n\n== Players==\n{{updated|31 January 2020}}<ref>{{cite web |title=Bristol Rovers Squad |url=http://www.skysports.com/bristol-rovers-squad |publisher=Sky Sports |accessdate=27 August 2018}}</ref>\n\n=== Current squad ===\n{{fs start}}\n{{fs player|no=1  |nat=NED |pos=GK |name=[[Jordi van Stappershoef]]|other=}}\n{{fs player|no=2  |nat=ENG |pos=DF |name=[[Mark Little (footballer)|Mark Little]]|other=}}\n{{fs player|no=3  |nat=ENG |pos=DF |name=[[Tareiq Holmes-Dennis]]|other=}}\n{{fs player|no=4  |nat=ENG |pos=MF |name=[[Abu Ogogo]]|other=3rd Captain}}\n{{fs player|no=5  |nat=ENG |pos=DF |name=[[Tony Craig]]|other=Vice Captain}}\n{{fs player|no=6  |nat=ENG |pos=MF |name=[[Ed Upson]]|other=}}\n{{fs player|no=7  |nat=ENG |pos=MF |name=[[Liam Sercombe]]|other=}}\n{{fs player|no=8  |nat=ENG |pos=MF |name=[[Ollie Clarke]]|other=Captain}}\n{{fs player|no=9  |nat=ENG |pos=FW |name=[[Jonson Clarke-Harris]]}}\n{{fs player|no=11 |nat=ENG |pos=DF |name=[[Luke Leahy]]|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=14 |nat=ENG |pos=MF |name=[[Josh Ginnelly]]|other=on loan from [[Preston North End F.C.|Preston North End]]}}\n{{fs player|no=15 |nat=ENG |pos=DF |name=[[Alfie Kilgour]]|other=}}\n{{fs player|no=16 |nat=ENG |pos=DF |name=[[Tom Davies (footballer, born 1992)|Tom Davies]]|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=17 |nat=ENG|pos=FW|name=James Daly|other=}}\n{{fs mid}}\n{{fs player|no=18 |nat=SCO |pos=DF |name=[[Michael Kelly (footballer, born 1997)|Michael Kelly]]|other=}}\n{{fs player|no=20 |nat=SCO |pos=FW |name=[[Gavin Reilly]]|other=}}\n{{fs player|no=21 |nat=ENG |pos=GK|name=[[Jamal Blackman]]|other=on loan from [[Chelsea F.C.|Chelsea]]}}\n{{fs player|no=22 |nat=ENG |pos=DF|name=[[Josh Hare]]|other=}}\n{{fs player|no=23 |nat=ENG |pos=MF |name=[[Kyle Bennett (footballer)|Kyle Bennett]]|other=}}\n{{fs player|no=24 |nat=WAL |pos=DF |name=[[Rollin Menayese]]|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no=25 |nat=WAL|pos=DF|name=[[Cian Harries]]|other=}}\n{{fs player|no=26 |nat=ENG |pos=MF |name=[[Samuel Matthews (footballer)|Sam Matthews]]|other=}}\n{{fs player|no=27 |nat=ENG |pos=MF |name=[[Jayden Mitchell-Lawson]]|other=on loan from [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]]}}\n{{fs player|no=29 |nat=ENG|pos=FW|name=[[Timmy Abraham]]|other=on loan from [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]]}}\n{{fs player|no=32 |nat=FIN |pos=GK |name=[[Anssi Jaakkola]]|other=}}\n{{fs player|no=33 |nat=ENG |pos=MF |name=[[Alex Rodman]]|other=}}\n{{fs player|no=36 |nat=ENG |pos=MF |name=[[Cameron Hargreaves]]|other=}}\n{{fs player|no=39 |nat=IRL|pos=MF|name=[[Josh Barrett (footballer)|Josh Barrett]]|other=}}\n{{fs end}}\n\n====Development squad====\n{{fs start}}\n{{fs player|no=28 |nat=ENG |pos=MF |name=[[Lucas Tomlinson]]|other=}}\n{{fs player|no=31 |nat=MAR |pos=GK |name=[[Alexis Andr\u00e9 Jr.]]|other=}}\n{{fs player|no=34 |nat=ENG |pos=MF |name=Ben Morgan|other=}}\n{{fs player|no=35 |nat=WAL |pos=MF |name=[[Luca Hoole]]|other= }}\n{{fs player|no=41 |nat=ENG |pos=FW |name=Kieran Phillips|other=}}\n{{fs player|no=46 |nat=ENG |pos=MF |name=[[Zain Walker]]|other=}}\n{{fs player|no=47 |nat=ENG |pos=MF |name=[[Theo Widdrington]]|other=}}\n{{fs player|no=50 |nat=ENG |pos=MF |name=James Spruce|other=}}\n{{fs mid}}\n{{fs player|no= |nat=ENG |pos=GK |name=Liam Armstrong|other=}}\n{{fs player|no= |nat=WAL |pos=DF |name=Alfie Clarke|other=}}\n{{fs player|no= |nat=ENG |pos=DF |name=Harry Hodges|other=}}\n{{fs player|no= |nat=ENG |pos=MF |name=[[Connor Jones (footballer)|Connor Jones]]|other= }}\n{{fs player|no= |nat=ENG |pos=FW |name=Rhys Kavanagh|other=}}\n{{fs player|no= |nat=ENG |pos=MF |name=Lewis Leigh-Gilchrist|other=}}\n{{Fs player|no= |nat=ENG |pos=MF|name=Tom Mehew|other=}}\n{{fs end}}\n\n==== Out on loan ====\n{{fs start}}\n{{fs player|no=10 |nat=ENG |pos=FW |name=[[Tom Nichols (footballer)|Tom Nichols]]|other=on loan at [[Cheltenham Town F.C.|Cheltenham Town]]}}\n{{fs player|no=49 |nat=ENG |pos=FW |name=Harry Warwick|other=on loan at [[Dorchester Town F.C.|Dorchester Town]]}}\n{{fs player|no=64 |nat=WAL|pos=MF |name=Lewis Clutton|other=on loan at [[Salisbury F.C.|Salisbury]]}}\n{{fs player|no= |nat=ENG |pos=MF |name=[[Luke Russe]]|other=on loan at [[Chippenham Town F.C.|Chippenham Town]]}}\n{{fs end}}\n\n=== Notable former players ===\n{{For|a list of Bristol Rovers players who have made at least 100 league appearances|List of Bristol Rovers F.C. players}}\n{{For|a full list of all Bristol Rovers players to be capped at full international level|List of Bristol Rovers F.C. internationals}}\n{{For|a list of all Bristol Rovers players with articles on Wikipedia|Category:Bristol Rovers F.C. players}}\n\nThis is a list of the most noted former players at Bristol Rovers Football Club, stating the period that each player spent at the club, their nationality and their reason for being listed.

During the game the following day, Rovers were winning quite comfortably and the few Argyle supporters present began to leave early prompting a chorus of \"Goodnight Argyle\" from the Rovers supporters\u2014the tune stuck and ''Irene'' became the club song.<ref>Byrne & Jay (2003), p225</ref>\n\nAnother popular Bristol Rovers song is \"Tote End Boys\", which was written and sung by Ben Gunstone.

The merger with Cable-Tel meant that Bristol Rovers had a [[first team|senior squad]]. The club's name was changed to Bristol Academy W.F.C. in 2005 to reflect the increased investment from the [[South Gloucestershire and Stroud College|Bristol Academy of Sport]].

It has a [[masthead sloop]] rig, or an optional [[cutter (boat)|cutter]] or [[yawl]] rig, all with [[aluminum]] spars. It features a spooned [[raked stem]], a raised counter [[reverse transom]], a keel-mounted [[rudder]] controlled by an Edson [[Ship's wheel|wheel]] and a fixed modified long [[keel]], with a cutaway forefoot. A stub keel and [[centerboard]] was optional. It displaces {{convert|17580|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}} and carries {{convert|6500|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}} of lead ballast.<ref name=\"Data\"/><ref name=\"Sherwood\"/>\n\nThe boat has a draft of {{convert|5.40|ft|m|abbr=on}} with the standard long keel, while the centreboard-equipped version has a draft of {{convert|7.8|ft|m|abbr=on}} with the centreboard extended and {{convert|4.0|ft|m|abbr=on}} with it retracted, allowing operation in shallow water.<ref name=\"Data\"/>\n\nThe boat is fitted with a [[Universal Atomic 4]] {{convert|30|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} [[gasoline engine]] for docking and maneuvering, although a [[Westerbeke]] [[diesel engine]] was a factory option. The fuel tank holds {{convert|31|u.s.gal}} and the fresh water tank has a capacity of {{convert|130|u.s.gal}}.<ref name=\"Data\"/>\n\nThe design has sleeping accommodation for six people, with a double \"V\"-berth in the bow cabin, an \"U\"-shaped settee and dinette table on the port side of the main cabin that converts to a double berth. There is a straight settee, with a pipe berth above it, also in the main cabin. The [[Galley (kitchen)|galley]] is located on the port side, just forward of the [[companionway]] ladder. The galley is equipped with a three-burner alcohol-fired stove, an oven and a sink. A navigation station is opposite the galley, on the starboard side. The [[Head (watercraft)|head]] is located just aft of the bow cabin on the port side and includes a shower.<ref name=\"Sherwood\"/>\n\nThe bow cabin has a double-hinged hatch for ventilation, that can be opened facing forward or aft. There is also a [[dorade box]] on the forward deck.<ref name=\"Sherwood\"/>\n\nFor sailing the boat has two cockpit-mounted primary [[jib]] winches, plus two secondary ones, plus a jib [[halyard]] winch as standard equipment. [[Jiffy reefing]] and a bow-mounted [[anchor]] roller were also standard.<ref name=\"Sherwood\"/>\n\nThe design has a [[Performance Handicap Racing Fleet|PHRF]] racing average handicap of 166.<ref name=\"Sherwood\"/>\n\n==Operational history==\nIn a 1994 review Richard Sherwood wrote, \"the Bristol 40 is designed as a racer-cruiser. Many options, including a yawl rig, and several interior layouts are available for the owner who favors cruising. This boat, with its long bow and counter and full keel, is not for round-the-marker sailing, but it will do well on longer races.\"<ref name=\"Sherwood\"/>\n\nBob Pingel, writing in ''Sailing Magazine'' in 2011 noted, \"the boat sails quite well in moderate conditions, especially off the wind. The hull shape is designed for reaching and the 40 has won its class in the Marion to Bermuda race twice. Owners report that reefing early is the best way to deal with the initial tenderness and keep the boat on its lines.

It has a [[masthead sloop]] rig, or an optional [[cutter (boat)|cutter]] or [[yawl]] rig, all with [[aluminum]] spars. It features a spooned [[raked stem]], a raised counter [[reverse transom]], a keel-mounted [[rudder]] controlled by an Edson [[Ship's wheel|wheel]] and a fixed modified long [[keel]], with a cutaway forefoot. A stub keel and [[centerboard]] was optional. It displaces {{convert|17580|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}} and carries {{convert|6500|lb|kg|0|abbr=on}} of lead ballast.<ref name=\"Data\"/><ref name=\"Sherwood\"/>\n\nThe boat has a draft of {{convert|5.40|ft|m|abbr=on}} with the standard long keel, while the centreboard-equipped version has a draft of {{convert|7.8|ft|m|abbr=on}} with the centreboard extended and {{convert|4.0|ft|m|abbr=on}} with it retracted, allowing operation in shallow water.<ref name=\"Data\"/>\n\nThe boat is fitted with a [[Universal Atomic 4]] {{convert|30|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} [[gasoline engine]] for docking and maneuvering, although a [[Westerbeke]] [[diesel engine]] was a factory option. The fuel tank holds {{convert|31|u.s.gal}} and the fresh water tank has a capacity of {{convert|130|u.s.gal}}.<ref name=\"Data\"/>\n\nThe design has sleeping accommodation for six people, with a double \"V\"-berth in the bow cabin, an \"U\"-shaped settee and dinette table on the port side of the main cabin that converts to a double berth. There is a straight settee, with a pipe berth above it, also in the main cabin. The [[Galley (kitchen)|galley]] is located on the port side, just forward of the [[companionway]] ladder. The galley is equipped with a three-burner alcohol-fired stove, an oven and a sink. A navigation station is opposite the galley, on the starboard side. The [[Head (watercraft)|head]] is located just aft of the bow cabin on the port side and includes a shower.<ref name=\"Sherwood\"/>\n\nThe bow cabin has a double-hinged hatch for ventilation, that can be opened facing forward or aft. There is also a [[dorade box]] on the forward deck.<ref name=\"Sherwood\"/>\n\nFor sailing the boat has two cockpit-mounted primary [[jib]] winches, plus two secondary ones, plus a jib [[halyard]] winch as standard equipment. [[Jiffy reefing]] and a bow-mounted [[anchor]] roller were also standard.<ref name=\"Sherwood\"/>\n\nThe design has a [[Performance Handicap Racing Fleet|PHRF]] racing average handicap of 166.<ref name=\"Sherwood\"/>\n\n<!-- ==Operational history== -->\n==Operational history==\nIn a 1994 review Richard Sherwood wrote, \"the Bristol 40 is designed as a racer-cruiser. Many options, including a yawl rig, and several interior layouts are available for the owner who favors cruising. This boat, with its long bow and counter and full keel, is not for round-the-marker sailing, but it will do well on longer races.\"<ref name=\"Sherwood\"/>\n\nBob Pingel, writing in ''Sailing Magazine'' in 2011 noted, \"the boat sails quite well in moderate conditions, especially off the wind. The hull shape is designed for reaching and the 40 has won its class in the Marion to Bermuda race twice. Owners report that reefing early is the best way to deal with the initial tenderness and keep the boat on its lines. Upwind, the centerboard helps the boat track, and while it is not particularly close winded, it doesn't make a lot of leeway and the motion is soft.\" Of the optional yawl rig, he stated, \"A yawl was optional and I confess, as impractical as a yawl is, they sure are beautiful. The yawl, like the centerboard, was favored by the CCA rule because sail area aft of the rudder post was not counted in your rating. And there's no better place to mount a radar dome anyway.\"<ref name=\"Pingel\"/>\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of sailing boat types]]\n\n'''Similar sailboats'''\n*[[Baltic 40]]\n*[[Endeavour 40]]\n*[[Islander 40]]\n*[[Nordic 40]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n<!-- ==External links== -->\n[[Category:Keelboats]]\n[[Category:1970s sailboat type designs]]\n[[Category:Sailing yachts]]\n", "name_user": "Ahunt", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eDesign:removed commented out title - duplicate", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bristol_40"}

The most common early motif is the death's head, intended to represent the mortal remains of the deceased joined with he wings that would take their soul to heaven.<ref name=\"wb206\">Wenhworth Batignani (2003), p. 206</ref> The art reflects the simplistic artistry that the period strove towards, in a religious doctrine that eschewed decoration or embellishment of any kind.<ref>Garvan (1960), pp. 106-122</ref> \n\nCoffins, [[urn]]s and imagery of the Triumph of Death are common iconographical elemts, as are [[memento mori]] such as hourglasses, [[scythe]]s and symbols of the [[resurrection]] of Christ.<ref>Ludwig (2000), p. 82</ref> The simplicity of the designs is a direct reaction against old world imagery and burial practices and was intended to convey both faith and the fact that death was ever present for colonists at the time.<ref>Ludwig(2000), p. 52</ref> Later mid-18th imagery of [[cherubs]], [[urn]]s and [[willow tree]]s (symbolising earthly sorrows) are common, but not really puritan motifs.<ref name=\"wb206\" />\n\nThe region's [[funerary art]] comprises most of the earliest Western art extant in the modern United States, and provides an unique insight into the Puritan view of death. Although Puritans vehemently rejected Catholic imagery, their gravestones leave concrete evidence for their devotion to sculptural religious art.<ref>Prioli (1981), p. 328</ref> The primary objective of their funerary art was to extol the virtues of paradise and the transformation of the flesh to spirit. There was a distinct shift that emphasized the inappropriateness of scriptural art. The narrative style of England had changed to one of emblems. Puritans were adamantly against attributing human form to spiritual beings such as God, angels, or spirits, so iconography such as death was preferable and did not violate the second commandment.\n\n==Historical context==\n[[File:New England death Head (c).jpg|left|upright=1.4|thumb|Death's head, Boston MA]]\nThe earliest puritan graves were either unmarked, or had very simple greenstone [[headstone]]s with little order to their plotting,<ref name=\"G13\">Greene (2007), p. 13</ref> and no decorations or ornamentation to mark individual graves.<ref name=\"BGov\">\"[https://www.boston.gov/departments/parks-and-recreation/iconography-gravestones-burying-grounds Iconography of Gravestones at Burying Grounds]\". [[Boston City Hall]], October 25 2019. Retrieved April 11 2020</ref> This was in part because they wanted to avoid the worship of ancestors through stone images; according to writer Meg Greene \"burying grounds were simply places to deposit the remains of the dead\".<ref name=\"G13\" /> The inscriptions were brief, factual and typically carved with \"interruptive punctuation\" with a [[interpunct]] (raised period) between each word.<ref name=\"BGov\" />\n\nThe modern view of death and burial recoils from the use of coffins, skulls and bones that were typically seen on gravestones of the puritan period. The use of simplistic, line drawn imagery was a deliberate rejection of Catholic [[iconography]], a choice also reflected in the design of their churches, portrait paintings and [[stained glass]].<ref>Garvan (1960), p. 108</ref>\n\nThe gravestone carvings largely share a uniformity of detail. Full names, kinship, age at death and the year of death are always given, while the dating of placement of the stone itself is also present; typically the were commissioned and erected with a year of the burial.<ref name=\"d502\">Dethlefsen (1966) p. 502</ref> A significant number contain [[epitaphs]], the tone of which is often correlated with the severity or bleakness of the design.<ref name=\"d502\" /> In 1980, the historian Peter Benes described one such grave yard in Plymouth County in terms of \"menacing stares, impish smiles, and enigmatic facial contortions combine with totally abstract effigies to stop the modern viewer in his tracks, while revealing little of their significance\".<ref>Prioli (1980), p. 335</ref>\n\nPuritan grave art reflects a deliberate move away from the European [[Baroque|High Baroque]] type towards a more provincial [[folk art|folk style]].<ref>Ludwig (2000), p. 244</ref> In this it reflects a general move towards a more vernacular and direct mode of expression, but practically, the style allowed the production of  a far greater number of stylized headstones by removing the need for the carvers having deep workshop experience.<ref name=\"l249\" />\n\nAlthough the New England style was heavily influenced by contemporary or slightly earlier trends in rural England and Scotland,<ref name=\"l249\">Ludwig (2000), p. 249</ref> this was more in terms of iconography and symbols than style.<ref name=\"l258\">Ludwig (2000), p. 258</ref> New England art of the time did not use Biblical allegories, nor did show depictions of the [[Christian cross]].<ref name=\"l258\" />\n\n== Stonecarvers==\nThe craftsmen who designed and carved the headstones were not specialists, rather generalists who also worked as smiths, leather-workers or printers. They tended to produce for their locally area only, and there are no known [[journeyman]] or itinerant carvers producing across a wide geographical area. However, a large number of surviving examples share strong overall decorative traditions, which some variation between regions.<ref name=\"d502\" />\n\nRural carvers were especially preoccupied by economy of [[Line art|line]] and [[Geometry|geometric]] and, at times abstract, patterns, in a un-stylized \"primitive\"<ref name=\"r431\">Ludwig (2000), p.431</ref> approach that tended towards simplicity and naturalism. As the approach is not detectable in later American art, the historian Allan Ludwig described it as a \"half-finished experiment in form making. Its place...must therefore be described as one of quite isolation. Nothing of the older tradition remained after 1815 but the silence of a forgotten epoc.\"<ref name=\"r428\">Ludwig (2000), p.428</ref>\n\nHarriette Forbes, working with Ernest Caulfield, in Massachusetts during the 1920's, was the first to study, photograph and catalog the 16th century graves.<ref name=\"p328\">Prioli (1979/80), p.328</ref>\n\n==Iconography==\n=== Death's heads ===\n[[File:Elizabeth Hurd headstone (36088).jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Later example;gravestone of Elizabeth Hurd (d. 1779), Boston]]\nThe death's head is one of the earliest and most frequently occurring motif in the New England Puritan art. It is most common on older stones, typically the head is winged, and accompanied by engraved imagery such as hourglasses, bones and coffins.<ref name=\"d503\">Dethlefsen (1966) p. 503</ref> Though seemingly frightening to modern viewers, the image of a skull was less about dread in Puritan New England, and more an accepted part of the human life cycle. In their belief system, death was when the flesh passed away to make way for renewal in the afterlife.<ref name=\"l77\">Ludwig (2000), p. 77</ref> The skulls should be taken in context of puritan funeral rituals in total, and their approach to [[elegy|elegies]], funerals rites and [[sermon]]s.<ref>Prioli (1980) , p. 334</ref> Death is first a winged head, but with careful analysis of gravestones, there is a distinct transformation to the glorification of the soul. \n\nAnother depiction of death is a full skeletal body, typically holding a scythe or with the moon and sun in his hands, an image meant to instill the terrors of death. In the corners of a typical stone with this depiction are angels at the top and bats of the underworld at the bottom. The scythe is most often mid swing among flowers symbolizes the flowering of a man's life cut off by death and time.\n\nA winged death head generally symbolizes the triumph of death. A typical image has serrated teeth, \u201chole eyes,\u201d a thin elongated jaw, and a slash for a mouth. This image has been commonly used since Elizabethan times.\n\nLater, the death's head image became less stern and menacing. The figure become crowned, with the lower jaw eliminated, and serrations of teeth appear on the upper row, a characteristic carving of the mid-18th century. Particularly, the eyes become more animated\u2014almond shaped and with pupils\u2014seeming more soul-like than deathlike. Extra imagery such as foliage, grapes and vines, and hearts suggest new life through sacraments and resurrection. This transition cannot be clearly, or easily, seen through the gravestones. The changes are very minute and gradual leaving some stones with a disturbing image in between an empty skull and a lively soul.\n\n===Cherubs===\nMostly dating from after the mid 18th century, these gravestone engravings show a living human arched by wings.<ref name=\"d503\">Dethlefsen (1966) p. 503</ref>\n\n===Other iconographical motifs===\nContinuing the evolution of the winged death head to the glorification of the soul, Soul effigies comprise skull-like representations of the soul developed into soul effigies<ref name=\"l168\">Ludwig (2000), p. 168</ref> with distinctly human faces. Some are placed in an enclosing motif, such as a solar symbol or a tree. Others retain the angels wings commonly seen in the death head.<ref name=\"l168\" />\n\nThe Imps of Death are depicted as small evil [[demon]]s bearing the arrows of death are sometimes found on early 18th century New England gravestones. They are particularly associated with the [[Charlestown, Boston|Charlestown]] stone mason Joseph Lamson, who carved naked imps either [[pallbearer|pallbearing]] or adorned with imagery of death and decay such as [[scythe]]s, darts of death, or [[hourglass]]es.<ref name=\"l100\">Ludwig (2000), p. 100</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{refbegin}}\n* Benes, Peter; Montague Benes; Jane. \"Puritan Gravestone Art II\".

The most common early motif is the death's head, intended to represent the mortal remains of the deceased joined with he wings that would take their soul to heaven.<ref name=\"wb206\">Wenhworth Batignani (2003), p. 206</ref> The art reflects the simplistic artistry that the period strove towards, in a religious doctrine that eschewed decoration or embellishment of any kind.<ref>Garvan (1960), pp. 106-122</ref> \n\nCoffins, [[urn]]s and imagery of the Triumph of Death are common iconographical elemts, as are [[memento mori]] such as hourglasses, [[scythe]]s and symbols of the [[resurrection]] of Christ.<ref>Ludwig (2000), p. 82</ref> The simplicity of the designs is a direct reaction against old world imagery and burial practices and was intended to convey both faith and the fact that death was ever present for colonists at the time.<ref>Ludwig(2000), p. 52</ref> Later mid-18th imagery of [[cherubs]], [[urn]]s and [[willow tree]]s (symbolising earthly sorrows) are common, but not really puritan motifs.<ref name=\"wb206\" />\n\nThe region's [[funerary art]] comprises most of the earliest Western art extant in the modern United States, and provides an unique insight into the Puritan view of death. Although Puritans vehemently rejected Catholic imagery, their gravestones leave concrete evidence for their devotion to sculptural religious art.<ref>Prioli (1981), p. 328</ref> The primary objective of their funerary art was to extol the virtues of paradise and the transformation of the flesh to spirit. There was a distinct shift that emphasized the inappropriateness of scriptural art. The narrative style of England had changed to one of emblems. Puritans were adamantly against attributing human form to spiritual beings such as God, angels, or spirits, so iconography such as death was preferable and did not violate the second commandment.\n\n==Historical context==\n[[File:New England death Head (c).jpg|left|upright=1.4|thumb|Death's head, Boston MA]]\nThe earliest puritan graves were either unmarked, or had very simple greenstone [[headstone]]s with little order to their plotting,<ref name=\"G13\">Greene (2007), p. 13</ref> and no decorations or ornamentation to mark individual graves.<ref name=\"BGov\">\"[https://www.boston.gov/departments/parks-and-recreation/iconography-gravestones-burying-grounds Iconography of Gravestones at Burying Grounds]\". [[Boston City Hall]], October 25 2019. Retrieved April 11 2020</ref> This was in part because they wanted to avoid the worship of ancestors through stone images; according to writer Meg Greene \"burying grounds were simply places to deposit the remains of the dead\".<ref name=\"G13\" /> The inscriptions were brief, factual and typically carved with \"interruptive punctuation\" with a [[interpunct]] (raised period) between each word.<ref name=\"BGov\" />\n\nThe modern view of death and burial recoils from the use of coffins, skulls and bones that were typically seen on gravestones of the puritan period. The use of simplistic, line drawn imagery was a deliberate rejection of Catholic [[iconography]], a choice also reflected in the design of their churches, portrait paintings and [[stained glass]].<ref>Garvan (1960), p. 108</ref>\n\nThe gravestone carvings largely share a uniformity of detail. Full names, kinship, age at death and the year of death are always given, while the dating of placement of the stone itself is also present; typically the were commissioned and erected with a year of the burial.<ref name=\"d502\">Dethlefsen (1966) p. 502</ref> A significant number contain [[epitaphs]], the tone of which is often correlated with the severity or bleakness of the design.<ref name=\"d502\" /> In 1980, the historian Peter Benes described one such grave yard in Plymouth County in terms of \"menacing stares, impish smiles, and enigmatic facial contortions combine with totally abstract effigies to stop the modern viewer in his tracks, while revealing little of their significance\".<ref>Prioli (1980), p. 335</ref>\n\nPuritan grave art reflects a deliberate move away from the European [[Baroque|High Baroque]] type towards a more provincial [[folk art|folk style]].<ref>Ludwig (2000), p. 244</ref> In this it reflects a general move towards a more vernacular and direct mode of expression, but practically, the style allowed the production of  a far greater number of stylized headstones by removing the need for the carvers having deep workshop experience.<ref name=\"l249\" />\n\nAlthough the New England style was heavily influenced by contemporary or slightly earlier trends in rural England and Scotland,<ref name=\"l249\">Ludwig (2000), p. 249</ref> this was more in terms of iconography and symbols than style.<ref name=\"l258\">Ludwig (2000), p. 258</ref> New England art of the time did not use Biblical allegories, nor did show depictions of the [[Christian cross]].<ref name=\"l258\" />\n\n== Stonecarvers==\nThe craftsmen who designed and carved the headstones were not specialists, rather generalists who also worked as smiths, leather-workers or printers. They tended to produce for their locally area only, and there are no known [[journeyman]] or itinerant carvers producing across a wide geographical area. However, a large number of surviving examples share strong overall decorative traditions, which some variation between regions.<ref name=\"d502\" />\n\nRural carvers were especially preoccupied by economy of [[Line art|line]] and [[Geometry|geometric]] and, at times abstract, patterns, in a un-stylized \"primitive\"<ref name=\"r431\">Ludwig (2000), p.431</ref> approach that tended towards simplicity and naturalism. As the approach is not detectable in later American art, the historian Allan Ludwig described it as a \"half-finished experiment in form making. Its place...must therefore be described as one of quite isolation. Nothing of the older tradition remained after 1815 but the silence of a forgotten epoc.\"<ref name=\"r428\">Ludwig (2000), p.428</ref>\n\nHarriette Forbes, working with Ernest Caulfield, in Massachusetts during the 1920's, was the first to study, photograph and catalog the 16th century graves.<ref name=\"p328\">Prioli , p.328</ref>\n\n==Iconography==\n=== Death's heads ===\n[[File:Elizabeth Hurd headstone (36088).jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Later example;gravestone of Elizabeth Hurd (d. 1779), Boston]]\nThe death's head is one of the earliest and most frequently occurring motif in the New England Puritan art. It is most common on older stones, typically the head is winged, and accompanied by engraved imagery such as hourglasses, bones and coffins.<ref name=\"d503\">Dethlefsen (1966) p. 503</ref> Though seemingly frightening to modern viewers, the image of a skull was less about dread in Puritan New England, and more an accepted part of the human life cycle. In their belief system, death was when the flesh passed away to make way for renewal in the afterlife.<ref name=\"l77\">Ludwig (2000), p. 77</ref> The skulls should be taken in context of puritan funeral rituals in total, and their approach to [[elegy|elegies]], funerals rites and [[sermon]]s.<ref>Prioli (1980) , p. 334</ref> Death is first a winged head, but with careful analysis of gravestones, there is a distinct transformation to the glorification of the soul. \n\nAnother depiction of death is a full skeletal body, typically holding a scythe or with the moon and sun in his hands, an image meant to instill the terrors of death. In the corners of a typical stone with this depiction are angels at the top and bats of the underworld at the bottom. The scythe is most often mid swing among flowers symbolizes the flowering of a man's life cut off by death and time.\n\nA winged death head generally symbolizes the triumph of death. A typical image has serrated teeth, \u201chole eyes,\u201d a thin elongated jaw, and a slash for a mouth. This image has been commonly used since Elizabethan times.\n\nLater, the death's head image became less stern and menacing. The figure become crowned, with the lower jaw eliminated, and serrations of teeth appear on the upper row, a characteristic carving of the mid-18th century. Particularly, the eyes become more animated\u2014almond shaped and with pupils\u2014seeming more soul-like than deathlike. Extra imagery such as foliage, grapes and vines, and hearts suggest new life through sacraments and resurrection. This transition cannot be clearly, or easily, seen through the gravestones. The changes are very minute and gradual leaving some stones with a disturbing image in between an empty skull and a lively soul.\n\n===Cherubs===\nMostly dating from after the mid 18th century, these gravestone engravings show a living human arched by wings.<ref name=\"d503\">Dethlefsen (1966) p. 503</ref>\n\n===Other iconographical motifs===\nContinuing the evolution of the winged death head to the glorification of the soul, Soul effigies comprise skull-like representations of the soul developed into soul effigies<ref name=\"l168\">Ludwig (2000), p. 168</ref> with distinctly human faces. Some are placed in an enclosing motif, such as a solar symbol or a tree. Others retain the angels wings commonly seen in the death head.<ref name=\"l168\" />\n\nThe Imps of Death are depicted as small evil [[demon]]s bearing the arrows of death are sometimes found on early 18th century New England gravestones. They are particularly associated with the [[Charlestown, Boston|Charlestown]] stone mason Joseph Lamson, who carved naked imps either [[pallbearer|pallbearing]] or adorned with imagery of death and decay such as [[scythe]]s, darts of death, or [[hourglass]]es.<ref name=\"l100\">Ludwig (2000), p. 100</ref>\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Sources==\n{{refbegin}}\n* Benes, Peter; Montague Benes; Jane. \"Puritan Gravestone Art II\".
