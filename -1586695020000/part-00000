Between 1966 and 1973, Croce released five studio albums and numerous singles.\n\nHis first two albums were commercially unsuccessful, failing to chart or produce any hit singles. During this period, Croce took a series of odd jobs to pay bills while he  continued to write, record, and perform concerts. After forming a partnership with songwriter and guitarist [[Maury Muehleisen]], his fortunes turned in the early 1970s. His breakthrough came in 1972; his third album ''[[You Don't Mess Around with Jim]]'' produced three charting singles, including \"[[Time in a Bottle]]\", which reached No. 1 after his death. The follow-up album, ''[[Life and Times (Jim Croce album)|Life and Times]]'' contained the song \"[[Bad, Bad Leroy Brown]]\", which was the only No. 1 hit he had during his lifetime.\n\nOn September 20, 1973, the day before the lead single to his fifth album, ''[[I Got a Name]]'', was released, Croce, along with five others, was killed in a plane crash, at the height of his popularity. Croce's music continued to chart throughout the 1970s following his death. His wife, [[Ingrid Croce]], was his early songwriting partner and she continued to write and record after his death, and his son [[A. J.

He later said, \"We just ate what the people ate, lived in the woods, and played our songs. Of course they didn't speak English over there but if you mean what you're singing, people understand.\" On November 29, 1963, Croce met his future wife [[Ingrid Croce|Ingrid Jacobson]] at the [[Philadelphia Convention Hall]] during a [[hootenanny]], where he was judging a contest.\n\nCroce released his first album, [[Facets (album)|''Facets'']], in 1966, with 500 copies pressed. The album had been financed with a $500 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|500|1966}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}) wedding gift from Croce's parents, who set a condition that the money must be spent to make an album.

At first, their performances included songs by artists such as [[Ian & Sylvia]], [[Gordon Lightfoot]], [[Joan Baez]], and [[Arlo Guthrie]], but in time they began writing their own music. During this time, Croce got his first long-term gig at a suburban bar and [[steakhouse]] in [[Lima, Pennsylvania]], called The Riddle Paddock. His set list covered several genres, including blues, country, rock and roll, and folk.\n\nIn 1968, the Croces were encouraged by record producer [[Tommy West (producer)|Tommy West]] to move to [[New York City]].

But I'd rather do other things than get burned.\" His determination to be \"serious\" led to a job at a Philadelphia [[R&B]] AM radio station, [[WHAT (AM)|WHAT]], where he translated commercials into \"soul.\" \"I'd sell airtime to Bronco's Poolroom and then write the spot: \"You wanna be cool, and you wanna shoot pool ... ''dig it''.\"\n\nIn 1970, Croce met classically trained pianist-guitarist and singer-songwriter [[Maury Muehleisen]] from [[Trenton, New Jersey]], through producer Joe Salviuolo. Salviuolo and Croce had been friends when they studied at Villanova University, and Salviuolo had met Muehleisen when he was teaching at [[Rowan University|Glassboro State College]] in New Jersey. Salviuolo brought Croce and Muehleisen together at the [[production office]] of [[Tommy West (producer)|Tommy West]] and [[Terry Cashman]] in New York City. Croce at first backed Muehleisen on guitar,  but gradually their roles reversed, with Muehleisen adding a lead guitar to Croce's music.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\nWhen Jim Croce and Ingrid discovered they were going to have a child, Jim became more determined to make music his profession. He sent a cassette of his new songs to a friend and producer in New York City in the hope that he could get a record deal. When their son [[A. J. Croce|Adrian James (A.J.)]] was born in September 1971, Ingrid became a stay-at-home mom while Jim went on the road to promote his music.\n\nIn 1972, Croce signed a three-record contract with [[ABC Records]], releasing two albums, ''[[You Don't Mess Around with Jim]]'' and ''[[Life and Times (Jim Croce album)|Life and Times]]''. The singles \"[[You Don't Mess Around with Jim (song)|You Don't Mess Around with Jim]]\", \"[[Operator (That's Not the Way It Feels)]]\" and \"[[Time in a Bottle]]\" (which features in the movie, [[X-Men: Days of Future Past]]) all received airplay. Also that year, the Croce family moved to [[San Diego]], [[California]]. Croce began appearing on television, including his national debut on ''American Bandstand''<ref>americanbandstandperformerlist</ref> on August 12, ''The Tonight Show''<ref>johnnycarson.com</ref> on August 14 and ''The Dick Cavett Show'' on September 20 and 21.\n\nCroce began touring the United States with Muehleisen, performing in large coffee houses, on college campuses and at folk festivals. However, his financial situation was still bad. The record company had fronted him the money to record and much of his earnings went to pay back the advance. {{nowrap|In February 1973,}} Croce and Muehleisen travelled to [[Europe]], performing in [[London]], [[Paris]],  [[Amsterdam]], [[Monte Carlo]], [[Zurich]] and [[Dublin]] and receiving positive reviews. Croce made television appearances on ''[[The Midnight Special (TV series)|The Midnight Special]],'' which he co-hosted on {{nowrap|June 15}}, and ''The Helen Reddy Show'' on July 19. Croce's biggest single, \"[[Bad, Bad Leroy Brown]],\" reached Number 1 on the American charts in July.\n\nFrom July 16 through August 4, Croce and Muehleisen returned to London and performed on ''[[The Old Grey Whistle Test]],'' where they sang \"Lover's Cross\" and \"[[Workin' at the Car Wash Blues]]\" from their upcoming album ''[[I Got a Name]].'' Croce finished recording the album just a week before his death. While on tour, he grew increasingly homesick and decided to take a break from music and settle with Ingrid and A.J. when his ''Life and Times'' tour ended.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.jimcroce.com/articles/article-written-by-barry-weber.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120807083834/http://www.jimcroce.com/articles/article-written-by-barry-weber.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-08-07 |first=Bryan |last=Weber |title=Article |publisher=Jim Croce- The Official Site |date=2014 |accessdate=2014-04-11 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|first=Colin |last=Devenish |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/croces-lost-recordings-due-20030820 |title=Croce's Lost Recordings Due |publisher=Rolling Stone |date=2003-08-20 |accessdate=2014-04-11}}</ref> In a letter to Ingrid which arrived after his death, Croce told her he had decided to quit music and stick to writing short stories and movie scripts as a career and withdraw from {{nowrap|public life.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\" /><ref>Everitt, Richard:''Falling Stars: Air Crashes that Filled Rock and Roll Heaven'' (2004)</ref>}}\n\n== Death ==\nOn Thursday, September 20, 1973, during Croce's ''Life and Times'' tour and the day before his ABC single \"[[I Got a Name (song)|I Got a Name]]\" was released, Croce and all five others on board were killed when their chartered [[Beechcraft Model 18|Beechcraft E18S]] crashed into a tree during takeoff from the [[Natchitoches Regional Airport]] in [[Natchitoches, Louisiana]].

After forming a partnership with songwriter and guitarist [[Maury Muehleisen]], his fortunes turned in the early 1970s. His breakthrough came in 1972; his third album ''[[You Don't Mess Around with Jim]]'' produced three charting singles, including \"[[Time in a Bottle]]\", which reached No. 1 after his death. The follow-up album, ''[[Life and Times (Jim Croce album)|Life and Times]]'' contained the song \"[[Bad, Bad Leroy Brown]]\", which was the only No. 1 hit he had during his lifetime.\n\nOn September 20, 1973, the day before the lead single to his fifth album, ''[[I Got a Name]]'', was released, Croce, along with five others, was killed in a plane crash, at the height of his popularity. Croce's music continued to chart throughout the 1970s following his death. His wife, [[Ingrid Croce]], was his early songwriting partner and she continued to write and record after his death, and his son [[A. J. Croce]] himself became a singer-songwriter in the 1990s.\n\n==Early life==\nCroce was born January 10, 1943,<ref>{{cite news|url= https://www.upi.com/Top_News/2020/01/10/UPI-Almanac-for-Friday-Jan-10-2020/8011578535365/ |title= UPI Almanac for Friday, Jan. 10, 2020 |agency= [[United Press International]] | date= January 10, 2020|accessdate=February 1, 2020 |archivedate= January 11, 2020|archiveurl= http://archive.is/pMTJV|url-status=live|quote=\u2026 singer Jim Croce in 1943}}</ref> in [[South Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], to James Albert Croce and Flora Mary (Babusci) Croce, both [[Italian Americans]] from [[Trasacco]] and [[Balsorano]] in [[Abruzzo]] and [[Palermo]] in [[Sicily]].<ref name=\"KeningLimited1991\">{{cite book|author1=Dan Kening|author2=Publications International, Limited|author3=David O'Shea|author4=Jay Paris|title=Too Young to Die|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l_2quq0BXaoC|accessdate=August 19, 2011|date=June 1991|publisher=Publications International, Limited|page=37|isbn=978-0-88176-932-6}}</ref><ref>[https://www.geni.com/people/Jim-Croce/6000000070323228958 James Joseph Croce on Geni.com] James Albert Croce son of Pasquale Anthony Croce born May 14, 1888, in Trasacco (Abruzzo) and Carmella Croce born June 24, 1894, in Palermo (Sicily).

He later said, \"We just ate what the people ate, lived in the woods, and played our songs. Of course they didn't speak English over there but if you mean what you're singing, people understand.\" On November 29, 1963, Croce met his future wife [[Ingrid Croce|Ingrid Jacobson]] at the [[Philadelphia Convention Hall]] during a [[hootenanny]], where he was judging a contest.\n\nCroce released his first album, [[Facets (album)|''Facets'']], in 1966, with 500 copies pressed. The album had been financed with a $500 (${{formatnum:{{Inflation|US|500|1966}}}} in {{Inflation-year|US}} dollars{{inflation-fn|US}}) wedding gift from Croce's parents, who set a condition that the money must be spent to make an album.

During this time, Croce got his first long-term gig at a suburban bar and [[steakhouse]] in [[Lima, Pennsylvania]], called The Riddle Paddock.

Salviuolo and Croce had been friends when they studied at Villanova University, and Salviuolo had met Muehleisen when he was teaching at [[Rowan University|Glassboro State College]] in New Jersey. Salviuolo brought Croce and Muehleisen together at the [[production office]] of [[Tommy West (producer)|Tommy West]] and [[Terry Cashman]] in New York City. Croce at first backed Muehleisen on guitar,  but gradually their roles reversed, with Muehleisen adding a lead guitar to Croce's music.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}\n\nWhen Jim Croce and Ingrid discovered they were going to have a child, Jim became more determined to make music his profession. He sent a cassette of his new songs to a friend and producer in New York City in the hope that he could get a record deal. When their son [[A. J. Croce|Adrian James (A.J.)]] was born in September 1971, Ingrid became a stay-at-home mom while Jim went on the road to promote his music.\n\nIn 1972, Croce signed a three-record contract with [[ABC Records]], releasing two albums, ''[[You Don't Mess Around with Jim]]'' and ''[[Life and Times (Jim Croce album)|Life and Times]]''. The singles \"[[You Don't Mess Around with Jim (song)|You Don't Mess Around with Jim]]\", \"[[Operator (That's Not the Way It Feels)]]\" and \"[[Time in a Bottle]]\" (which features in the movie, [[X-Men: Days of Future Past]]) all received airplay. Also that year, the Croce family moved to [[San Diego]], [[California]]. Croce began appearing on television, including his national debut on ''American Bandstand''<ref>americanbandstandperformerlist</ref> on August 12, ''The Tonight Show''<ref>johnnycarson.com</ref> on August 14 and ''The Dick Cavett Show'' on September 20 and 21.\n\nCroce began touring the United States with Muehleisen, performing in large coffee houses, on college campuses and at folk festivals. However, his financial situation was still bad. The record company had fronted him the money to record and much of his earnings went to pay back the advance. {{nowrap|In February 1973,}} Croce and Muehleisen travelled to [[Europe]], performing in [[London]], [[Paris]],  [[Amsterdam]], [[Monte Carlo]], [[Zurich]] and [[Dublin]] and receiving positive reviews. Croce made television appearances on ''[[The Midnight Special (TV series)|The Midnight Special]],'' which he co-hosted on {{nowrap|June 15}}, and ''The Helen Reddy Show'' on July 19. Croce's biggest single, \"[[Bad, Bad Leroy Brown]],\" reached Number 1 on the American charts in July.\n\nFrom July 16 through August 4, Croce and Muehleisen returned to London and performed on ''[[The Old Grey Whistle Test]],'' where they sang \"Lover's Cross\" and \"[[Workin' at the Car Wash Blues]]\" from their upcoming album ''[[I Got a Name]].'' Croce finished recording the album just a week before his death.

The Tang dynasty, with its capital at [[Chang'an]] (today's [[Xi'an]]), the most populous city in the world at the time, is regarded by historians as a high point in Chinese civilization\u2014equal, or even superior, to the [[Han dynasty|Han period]]. The Tang period was considered the [[golden age]] of literature and art.\n[[File:Anonymous-Bodhisattva Leading the Way.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Tang painting from [[Dunhuang]]]]\n\nIn several areas developments during the Tang set the direction for many centuries to come.  This was especially so in pottery, with glazed plain wares in [[celadon]] green and whitish porcelaineous types brought to a high level, and exported on a considerable scale. In painting, the period saw the peak level of Buddhist painting, and the emergence of the [[landscape painting]] tradition known as ''[[shanshui]]'' (mountain-water) painting.\n\nTrading along the [[Silk Road]] of various products increased cultural diversity in small China cities.<ref name=BMA>{{cite book|last=[[Birmingham Museum of Art]]|title=Birmingham Museum of Art : guide to the collection|year=2010|publisher=Birmingham Museum of Art|location=[Birmingham, Ala]|isbn=978-1-904832-77-5|pages=24|url=http://artsbma.org}}</ref>  Stimulated by contact with [[India]] and the [[Middle East]], the empire saw a flowering of creativity in many fields. [[Buddhism]], originating in what is modern day [[India]] around the time of [[Confucius]], continued to flourish during the Tang period and was adopted by the imperial family, becoming thoroughly sinicized and a permanent part of Chinese traditional culture. [[Block printing]] made the written word available to vastly greater audiences.\n\nCulturally, the [[An Lushan Rebellion]] of 745-763 weakened the confidence of the elite,<ref>Sullivan, 145</ref> and brought an end to the lavish style of [[Tang dynasty tomb figures|tomb figures]], as well as reducing the outward-looking culture of the early Tang, that was receptive to foreign influences from further west in Asia.  The [[Great Anti-Buddhist Persecution]], in fact against all foreign religions, which reached its peak in 845, had a great impact on all the arts, but especially the visual arts, greatly reducing demand for artists.\n\n==Painting==\n{{Main|Tang dynasty painting}}\n[[Image:Tang-hores1.jpg|290px|thumb|right|''[[Night-Shining White]]'', a [[handscroll]] attributed to [[Han Gan]] (active 742\u2013756).]]\nA considerable amount of literary and documentary information about Tang painting has survived, but very few works, especially of the highest quality.  There is a good deal of biographical information and [[art criticism]], mostly from later periods such as the [[Ming dynasty]], several centuries after the Tang; the accuracy of this needs to be considered, and much of it was probably already based on seeing copies of the art, not originals.  With a very few exceptions, traditional attributions of particular scroll paintings to Tang masters are now regarded with suspicion by art historians. \n\nA walled-up cave in the [[Dunhuang]] (Mogao Caves) complex was discovered by [[Aurel Stein]], which contained a vast haul, mostly of Buddhist writings, but also some banners and paintings, making much the largest group of paintings on silk to survive.  These are now in the [[British Museum]] and elsewhere.  They are not of court quality, but show a variety of styles, including those with influences from further west.  As with sculpture, other survivals showing Tang style are in Japan, though the most important, at Nara, was very largely destroyed in a fire in 1949.<ref>Sullivan, 132-133</ref>\n\nThe rock-cut cave complexes and royal tombs also contain many wall-paintings; the paintings in the [[Qianling Mausoleum]] are the most important group of the latter, mostly now removed to a museum.  Not all the royal tombs have yet been opened.  Court painting mostly survives in what are certainly or arguably copies from much later, such as ''[[Emperor Taizong Receiving the Tibetan Envoy]]'', probably a later copy of the 7th century original by [[Yan Liben]], though the front section of the famous portrait of the [[Emperor Xuanzong of Tang|Emperor Xuanzong]]'s horse ''[[Night-Shining White]]'' is probably an original by [[Han Gan]] of 740\u2013760.<ref>Sullivan, 134-135</ref>  Yan Liben is an example of a famous painter who was also a very important official.\n\nMost Tang artists outlined figures with fine black lines and used brilliant color and elaborate detail filling in the outlines.  However, [[Wu Daozi]] used only black ink and freely painted brushstrokes to create ink paintings that were so exciting that crowds gathered to watch him work.  From his time on, ink paintings were no longer thought to be preliminary sketches or outlines to be filled in with color.  Instead, they were valued as finished works of art.\n\nThe Tang dynasty saw the maturity of the [[landscape painting]] tradition known as ''[[shanshui]]'' (mountain-water) painting, which became the most prestigious type of Chinese painting, especially when practiced by amateur [[scholar-official]] or \"literati\" painters in [[ink-wash painting]].  In these landscapes, usually monochromatic and sparse, the purpose was not to reproduce exactly the appearance of nature but rather to grasp an emotion or atmosphere so as to catch the \"rhythm\" of nature.\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\nImage:Xian 2006 6-21.jpg|Early [[T'ang dynasty|T'ang period]] palace maids, [[Shaanxi History Museum|Shensi History Museum]]\nImage:Court Ladies of the Tang.jpg|Tang court ladies, 706 AD, [[Qianling Mausoleum]]\nImage:Sui Wendi Tang.jpg|[[Emperor Wen of Sui]], attributed to [[Yan Liben]], 7th century\nImage:Central Asian Buddhist Monks.jpeg|Buddhist mural in the [[Bezeklik]] grottoes, 9th century\nImage:Tejaprabh\u0101 Buddha and the Five Planets by Chang Huai-hsing.jpg|\u201dTejaprabh\u0101 Buddha and the Five Planets\u201d, 897, [[British Museum]]\n</gallery>\n\n==Pottery==\n[[File:Joueuse de polo Tang Guimet 29101.jpg|thumb|[[Tang dynasty tomb figure|Ceramic tomb figure]] of a female polo player, before 750.]]\n[[Chinese ceramics]] saw many significant developments, including the first [[Chinese porcelain]] meeting both Western and Chinese definitions of [[porcelain]], in [[Ding ware]] and related types.

There were many bronze and wooden sculptures, whose style is best seen in the [[List of National Treasures of Japan (sculptures)|survivals in Japanese temples]]. [[Monumental sculpture]] in stone, and also terracotta, has survived at several complexes of rock-cut temples, of which the largest and most famous are the [[Longmen Grottoes]] and the [[Mogao Caves]] (at [[Dunhuang]]), both of which were at their peak of expansion during the Tang.

A rather different class and type of tomb sculpture is seen in the [[Six Steeds of Zhao Mausoleum|reliefs of the six favourite horses]] at the [[mausoleum]] of [[Emperor Taizong of Tang|Emperor Taizong]] (d. 649).

An exceptionally fine deposit is the collection in the [[T\u014ddai-ji]] in [[Nara, Nara|Nara]] in Japan of the personal goods of [[Emperor Sh\u014dmu]], given to the Buddhist shrine by his daughter [[Empress K\u014dmy\u014d]] after her father's death in 756.  As well as metalwork, paintings and calligraphy, this includes furniture, glass, lacquer and wood pieces such as musical instruments and board games.  Most is probably made in China, though some is Japanese and some from the Middle East.<ref>Sullivan, 139-140</ref>\n\nAnother important deposit was discovered in 1970 at [[Xi'an]] when the [[Hejia Village hoard]] was uncovered by construction. Placed into two large ceramic pots, 64 cm high, and a silver one, 25 cm high, this was a large collection of over a thousand objects, altogether representing a rather puzzling collection.  Several of them were gold or silver vessels and other objects of the highest quality, as well as [[hardstone carving]]s in [[jade]] and [[agate]], and gemstones.  It was probably hidden in a hurry during the An Lushan revolt, in which the Tang capital was taken more than once.  Many of the objects are imported, mostly from along the [[Silk Road]], especially [[Sogdia]], and others show Sogdian influence.<ref>Hansen, 152-157; Sullivan, 139</ref>  Two objects from the hoard (illustrated) are included on the very select official [[list of Chinese cultural relics forbidden to be exhibited abroad]].

The normal construction material for buildings other than towers, pagodas, and military works in the Tang was still wood, which does not survive very long if not maintained.<ref>Sullivan, 123-124</ref>  The [[rock-cut architecture]] of the famous surviving sites of course survives neglect far better, but the Chinese generally left the external facades of cave-temples unornamented, unlike the Indian equivalents at sites like the [[Ajanta Caves]].\n\nTwo large Tang [[pagoda]]s survive in the capital, now Xi'an, which otherwise has few remains dating back to the Tang. The oldest is the [[Giant Wild Goose Pagoda]], rebuilt in 704 in brick, and reduced in height after damage in the [[1556 Shaanxi earthquake]].  The [[Small Wild Goose Pagoda]] was also rebuilt in 704, but only lost a few metres in the earthquake.  Some Tang pagodas tried to reconcile the form with the Indian [[shikara]] temple tower, or even had a [[stupa]] as part of the superstructure; the Tah\u014dt\u014d at the [[Ishiyama-dera]] temple in Japan is a surviving later example, with a roof on top of the stupa.<ref>Sullivan, 125-126</ref> \n\nThe main hall of the relatively small rural [[Nanchan Temple]] has a main structure of wood.  Much of it appears to have survived from the original construction in 782, and it is recognised as the oldest wooden building in China.  The third oldest is the main hall of the nearby [[Foguang Temple]] of 857.<ref>Sullivan, 124</ref>\n\nBoth are studied for their ''[[dougong]]'' bracketing systems, joining the roof to the walls.  These complicated arrangements persisted until the end of traditional Chinese architecture, but are often considered to have reached a peak of elegance and harmony in the Song and Yuan dynasties, before becoming over-elaborate and fussy.  The Tang examples show an increase in complexity before the great periods, and the beginnings of the uplift at the edges of roof lines that was to grow stronger in later periods.  Once again, Japan has preserved rather more temple halls built in very similar styles (or in many cases has carefully rebuilt them as exact replicas over the centuries).<ref>Sullivan, 124-125</ref> \n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:ChinaTrip2005-110.jpg|[[Giant Wild Goose Pagoda]] in [[Xi'an]], 704\nFile:Xi'anwildgoosepagoda2.JPG|[[Small Wild Goose Pagoda]] in [[Xi'an]], 704\nImage:Jiudingta 2008 07 15 1.jpg|The [[Nine Pinnacle Pagoda]] of [[Shandong]], completed by 756 and crowned with an unusual set of miniature pagodas; it is also unique for its octagonal, rather than square, base plan.\nFile:Foguang Temple 8.JPG|The ''[[dougong]]'' bracketing system at [[Foguang Temple]], [[Mount Wutai]], [[Shanxi]], 857\n</gallery>\n\n==Music==\nThe first major well-documented flowering of Chinese music was for the [[Guqin|qin]] during the [[Tang dynasty]], though the qin is known to have been played since before the [[Han dynasty]].\n\nLate 20th century excavations of an intact tomb of the period revealed not only a number of instruments (including a spectacular concert bell set) but also inscribed tablets with playing instructions and musical scores for ensemble concerts, which are now heard again as played on reproduction instruments at the [[Hubei Provincial Museum]].\n\n==Opera==\n[[Chinese opera]] is generally dated back to the Tang dynasty with [[Emperor Xuanzong of Tang China|Emperor Xuanzong]] (712\u2013755), who founded the [[Pear Garden]], the first known opera troupe in China. The troupe mostly performed for the emperors' personal pleasure.\n\n==Poetry==\nThe [[Tang poetry|poetry of the Tang dynasty]] is perhaps the most highly-regarded poetic era in [[Chinese poetry]]. The ''[[Shi (poetry)|shi]]'', the classical form of poetry which had developed in the late Han dynasty, reached its zenith.  The [[anthology]] ''[[Three Hundred Tang Poems]]'', compiled much later, remains famous in China.\n\nDuring the Tang dynasty, poetry became popular, and writing poetry was considered a sign of learning. One of China's greatest poets was [[Li Bai|Li Po]], who wrote about ordinary people and about nature, which was a powerful force in Chinese art. One of Li Po's short poems, \"Waterfall at Lu-Shan\", shows how Li Po felt about nature.\n\n==Tang dynasty artists==\n* [[Bai Juyi]] (772\u2013846), [[List of Chinese language poets|poet]]\n* [[Zhou Fang (Tang dynasty)|Zhou Fang]] (730\u2013800), painter, also known as ''Zhou Jing Xuan'' and ''Zhong Lang''\n* [[Cui Hao (poet)|Cui Hao]], poet\n* [[Han Gan]] (718\u2013780), painter\n* [[Zhang Xuan]] (713\u2013755), painter\n* [[Du Fu]]  (712\u2013770), poet\n* [[Li Bai]] (701\u2013762), poet\n* [[Meng Haoran]] (689 or 691\u2013740), poet\n* [[Wang Wei (Tang dynasty)|Wang Wei]] (699\u2013759), poet, musician, painter\n* [[Wu Tao-Tzu]] (680\u2013740), famous for the [[mythology|myth]] of entering an art work\n* [[Zhang Jiuling]] (678\u2013740), poet\n\n==See also==\n* [[Chinese art]]\n*[[Qianling Mausoleum]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n{{commonscat|Art of the Tang Dynasty}}\n*[[Valerie Hansen|Hansen, Valerie]], ''The Silk Road: A New History'', 2015, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0190218428}}, 9780190218423, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=FDdRDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA152 google books]\n*[[Michael Sullivan (art historian)|Sullivan, Michael]], ''The Arts of China'', 1973, Sphere Books, {{ISBN|0351183345}} (revised edn of ''A Short History of Chinese Art'', 1967)\n*Vainker, S.J., ''Chinese Pottery and Porcelain'', 1991, British Museum Press, 9780714114705\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite book |author=Watt, James C.Y.| title=''China: dawn of a golden age, 200-750 AD'' | location=New York | publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art | year=2004 | isbn=1588391264|display-authors=etal | url=http://libmma.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p15324coll10/id/56691/rec/1}}\n\n{{Tang dynasty topics}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Tang dynasty art}}\n[[Category:Tang dynasty art|*]]\n[[Category:Architecture of China]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:Freer SacklerDSCF8036.JPG|thumb|350px|Silver wine cup, with birds and a rabbit amid scrolling plant forms.]]\n[[Image:Museum f\u00fcr Ostasiatische Kunst Dahlem Berlin Mai 2006 001.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Tang dynasty tomb figure]]]]\n\n'''Tang dynasty art''' ({{zh|t=\u5510\u671d\u85dd\u8853|s=\u5510\u671d\u827a\u672f}}) is [[Chinese art]] made during the [[Tang dynasty]] (618\u2013907).

The Tang period was considered the [[golden age]] of literature and art.\n[[File:Anonymous-Bodhisattva Leading the Way.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Tang painting from [[Dunhuang]]]]\n\nIn several areas developments during the Tang set the direction for many centuries to come.  This was especially so in pottery, with glazed plain wares in [[celadon]] green and whitish porcelaineous types brought to a high level, and exported on a considerable scale. In painting, the period saw the peak level of Buddhist painting, and the emergence of the [[landscape painting]] tradition known as ''[[shanshui]]'' (mountain-water) painting.\n\nTrading along the [[Silk Road]] of various products increased cultural diversity in small China cities.<ref name=BMA>{{cite book|last=[[Birmingham Museum of Art]]|title=Birmingham Museum of Art : guide to the collection|year=2010|publisher=Birmingham Museum of Art|location=[Birmingham, Ala]|isbn=978-1-904832-77-5|pages=24|url=http://artsbma.org}}</ref>  Stimulated by contact with [[India]] and the [[Middle East]], the empire saw a flowering of creativity in many fields. [[Buddhism]], originating in what is modern day [[India]] around the time of [[Confucius]], continued to flourish during the Tang period and was adopted by the imperial family, becoming thoroughly sinicized and a permanent part of Chinese traditional culture. [[Block printing]] made the written word available to vastly greater audiences.\n\nCulturally, the [[An Lushan Rebellion]] of 745-763 weakened the confidence of the elite,<ref>Sullivan, 145</ref> and brought an end to the lavish style of [[Tang dynasty tomb figures|tomb figures]], as well as reducing the outward-looking culture of the early Tang, that was receptive to foreign influences from further west in Asia.

There were many bronze and wooden sculptures, whose style is best seen in the [[List of National Treasures of Japan (sculptures)|survivals in Japanese temples]]. [[Monumental sculpture]] in stone, and also terracotta, has survived at several complexes of rock-cut temples, of which the largest and most famous are the [[Longmen Grottoes]] and the [[Mogao Caves]] (at [[Dunhuang]]), both of which were at their peak of expansion during the Tang.  The best combined \"the Indian feeling for solid, swelling form and the Chinese genius for expression in terms of linear rhythm ... to produce a style which was to become the basis of all later Buddhist sculpture in China.\"<ref>Sullivan, 126-127, 127 quoted</ref>\n\nThe tomb-figures are discussed above; though probably not treated very seriously as art by their producers, and sometimes rather sloppily made, and especially painted, they remain vigorous and effective as sculpture, especially when animals and foreigners are depicted, the latter with an element of caricature.  A rather different class and type of tomb sculpture is seen in the [[Six Steeds of Zhao Mausoleum|reliefs of the six favourite horses]] at the [[mausoleum]] of [[Emperor Taizong of Tang|Emperor Taizong]] (d. 649).  By tradition these were designed by the [[court painter]] [[Yan Liben]], and the relief is so flat and linear that it seems likely they were carved after drawings or paintings.<ref>Sullivan, 126</ref>\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:Ananda, Shanxi Province, China, Tang Dynasty, 8th century, marble - Royal Ontario Museum - DSC09817.JPG|Marble [[Ananda]], from Shanxi Province, one of [[Companion statues: Kashyapa and Ananda|a pair now in Canada]]\nFile:Maitreya-Tang Dynasty-side (cropped).JPG|[[Maitreya]], 2.4 metres high, from [[Longmen Grottoes]], [[Wu Zetian]] reign\nFile:TangBodhisattva.jpg|Tang dynasty [[bodhisattva]] statue missing its head and left arm\nFile:Guanyin (Tang China), Asian Art Museum (6016444483).jpg|Two [[Guanyin]] statues in [[gilt-bronze]]; only small bronze statues like this have survived.\nImage:Mourning attendant, Tang Dynasty.jpg|A limestone statue of a mourning attendant, 7th century\nImage:Mahayanabuddha.jpg|Seated Buddha statue in [[dry lacquer]] technique.\n</gallery>\n\n==Metalwork and decorative arts==\n[[File:Xian May 2007 113 (cropped).jpg|thumb|Carved [[agate]] drinking horn ([[Rhyton]]), from the [[Hejia Village hoard]]]]\nTang elite metalwork, surviving mostly in bronze or silver cups and mirrors, is often of superb quality, decorated using a variety of techniques, and often inlaid with gold and other metals.  An exceptionally fine deposit is the collection in the [[T\u014ddai-ji]] in [[Nara, Nara|Nara]] in Japan of the personal goods of [[Emperor Sh\u014dmu]], given to the Buddhist shrine by his daughter [[Empress K\u014dmy\u014d]] after her father's death in 756.  As well as metalwork, paintings and calligraphy, this includes furniture, glass, lacquer and wood pieces such as musical instruments and board games.  Most is probably made in China, though some is Japanese and some from the Middle East.<ref>Sullivan, 139-140</ref>\n\nAn other important deposit was discovered in 1970 at [[Xi'an]] when the [[Hejia Village hoard]] was uncovered by construction. Placed into two large ceramic pots, 64 cm high, and a silver one, 25 cm high, this was a large collection of over a thousand objects, altogether representing a rather puzzling collection.  Several of them were gold or silver vessels and other objects of the highest quality, as well as [[hardstone carving]]s in [[jade]] and [[agate]], and gemstones.  It was probably hidden in a hurry during the An Lushan revolt, in which the Tang capital was taken more than once.  Many of the objects are imported, mostly from along the [[Silk Road]], especially [[Sogdia]], and others show Sogdian influence.<ref>Hansen, 152-157; Sullivan, 139</ref>  Two objects from the hoard (illustrated) are included on the very select official [[list of Chinese cultural relics forbidden to be exhibited abroad]].  The hoard is now in the [[Shaanxi History Museum]].\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\nImage:Gilt hexagonal silver plate with a feilian beast pattern.jpg|Gilt hexagonal silver plate with a Fei Lian beast pattern\nImage:Jade dragon (Tang).jpg|[[Jade]]-carved dragon, Tang dynasty, [[Shanghai Museum]]\nFile:Mirror, lobed with a dragon and clouds, Tang dynasty, 7th-th century AD - Freer Gallery of Art - DSC05636.JPG|Mirror back with [[Chinese dragon|dragon]]\nFile:Mirror, square with floral medallion,plant sprays, birds, and insects, Tang dynasty, 7th-th century AD - Freer Gallery of Art - DSC05645.JPG|Mirror with floral medallion, plant sprays, birds, and insects, 7th century\nFile:Gilt silver jar with pattern of dancing horses.jpg|[[Silver-gilt]] ewer imitating a leather shape, from the [[Hejia Village hoard]]\n</gallery>\n\n==Architecture==\n[[File:Nanchan Temple 1.JPG|thumb|[[Nanchan Temple (Wutai)]], 782, the oldest wooden building in China.]]\nThere had been an enormous amount of building of Buddhist temples and monasteries, but in 845 these were all confiscated by the government, and the great majority destroyed. The normal construction material for buildings other than towers, pagodas, and military works in the Tang was still wood, which does not survive very long if not maintained.<ref>Sullivan, 123-124</ref>  The [[rock-cut architecture]] of the famous surviving sites of course survives neglect far better, but the Chinese generally left the external facades of cave-temples unornamented, unlike the Indian equivalents at sites like the [[Ajanta Caves]].\n\nTwo large Tang [[pagoda]]s survive in the capital, now Xi'an, which otherwise has few remains dating back to the Tang. The oldest is the [[Giant Wild Goose Pagoda]], rebuilt in 704 in brick, and reduced in height after damage in the [[1556 Shaanxi earthquake]].  The [[Small Wild Goose Pagoda]] was also rebuilt in 704, but only lost a few metres in the earthquake.  Some Tang pagodas tried to reconcile the form with the Indian [[shikara]] temple tower, or even had a [[stupa]] as part of the superstructure; the Tah\u014dt\u014d at the [[Ishiyama-dera]] temple in Japan is a surviving later example, with a roof on top of the stupa.<ref>Sullivan, 125-126</ref> \n\nThe main hall of the relatively small rural [[Nanchan Temple]] has a main structure of wood.  Much of it appears to have survived from the original construction in 782, and it is recognised as the oldest wooden building in China.  The third oldest is the main hall of the nearby [[Foguang Temple]] of 857.<ref>Sullivan, 124</ref>\n\nBoth are studied for their ''[[dougong]]'' bracketing systems, joining the roof to the walls.  These complicated arrangements persisted until the end of traditional Chinese architecture, but are often considered to have reached a peak of elegance and harmony in the Song and Yuan dynasties, before becoming over-elaborate and fussy.  The Tang examples show an increase in complexity before the great periods, and the beginnings of the uplift at the edges of roof lines that was to grow stronger in later periods.  Once again, Japan has preserved rather more temple halls built in very similar styles (or in many cases has carefully rebuilt them as exact replicas over the centuries).<ref>Sullivan, 124-125</ref> \n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:ChinaTrip2005-110.jpg|[[Giant Wild Goose Pagoda]] in [[Xi'an]], 704\nFile:Xi'anwildgoosepagoda2.JPG|[[Small Wild Goose Pagoda]] in [[Xi'an]], 704\nImage:Jiudingta 2008 07 15 1.jpg|The [[Nine Pinnacle Pagoda]] of [[Shandong]], completed by 756 and crowned with an unusual set of miniature pagodas; it is also unique for its octagonal, rather than square, base plan.\nFile:Foguang Temple 8.JPG|The ''[[dougong]]'' bracketing system at [[Foguang Temple]], [[Mount Wutai]], [[Shanxi]], 857\n</gallery>\n\n==Music==\nThe first major well-documented flowering of Chinese music was for the [[Guqin|qin]] during the [[Tang dynasty]], though the qin is known to have been played since before the [[Han dynasty]].\n\nLate 20th century excavations of an intact tomb of the period revealed not only a number of instruments (including a spectacular concert bell set) but also inscribed tablets with playing instructions and musical scores for ensemble concerts, which are now heard again as played on reproduction instruments at the [[Hubei Provincial Museum]].\n\n==Opera==\n[[Chinese opera]] is generally dated back to the Tang dynasty with [[Emperor Xuanzong of Tang China|Emperor Xuanzong]] (712\u2013755), who founded the [[Pear Garden]], the first known opera troupe in China. The troupe mostly performed for the emperors' personal pleasure.\n\n==Poetry==\nThe [[Tang poetry|poetry of the Tang dynasty]] is perhaps the most highly-regarded poetic era in [[Chinese poetry]]. The ''[[Shi (poetry)|shi]]'', the classical form of poetry which had developed in the late Han dynasty, reached its zenith.  The [[anthology]] ''[[Three Hundred Tang Poems]]'', compiled much later, remains famous in China.\n\nDuring the Tang dynasty, poetry became popular, and writing poetry was considered a sign of learning. One of China's greatest poets was [[Li Bai|Li Po]], who wrote about ordinary people and about nature, which was a powerful force in Chinese art. One of Li Po's short poems, \"Waterfall at Lu-Shan\", shows how Li Po felt about nature.\n\n==Tang dynasty artists==\n* [[Bai Juyi]] (772\u2013846), [[List of Chinese language poets|poet]]\n* [[Zhou Fang (Tang dynasty)|Zhou Fang]] (730\u2013800), painter, also known as ''Zhou Jing Xuan'' and ''Zhong Lang''\n* [[Cui Hao (poet)|Cui Hao]], poet\n* [[Han Gan]] (718\u2013780), painter\n* [[Zhang Xuan]] (713\u2013755), painter\n* [[Du Fu]]  (712\u2013770), poet\n* [[Li Bai]] (701\u2013762), poet\n* [[Meng Haoran]] (689 or 691\u2013740), poet\n* [[Wang Wei (Tang dynasty)|Wang Wei]] (699\u2013759), poet, musician, painter\n* [[Wu Tao-Tzu]] (680\u2013740), famous for the [[mythology|myth]] of entering an art work\n* [[Zhang Jiuling]] (678\u2013740), poet\n\n==See also==\n* [[Chinese art]]\n*[[Qianling Mausoleum]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==References==\n{{commonscat|Art of the Tang Dynasty}}\n*[[Valerie Hansen|Hansen, Valerie]], ''The Silk Road: A New History'', 2015, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0190218428}}, 9780190218423, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=FDdRDAAAQBAJ&pg=PA152 google books]\n*[[Michael Sullivan (art historian)|Sullivan, Michael]], ''The Arts of China'', 1973, Sphere Books, {{ISBN|0351183345}} (revised edn of ''A Short History of Chinese Art'', 1967)\n*Vainker, S.J., ''Chinese Pottery and Porcelain'', 1991, British Museum Press, 9780714114705\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite book |author=Watt, James C.Y.| title=''China: dawn of a golden age, 200-750 AD'' | location=New York | publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art | year=2004 | isbn=1588391264|display-authors=etal | url=http://libmma.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/compoundobject/collection/p15324coll10/id/56691/rec/1}}\n\n{{Tang dynasty topics}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Tang dynasty art}}\n[[Category:Tang dynasty art|*]]\n[[Category:Architecture of China]]\n", "name_user": "WereSpielChequers", "label": "safe", "comment": "Typo fixing, replaced: An other  \u2192 Another,typo(s) fixed: highly- \u2192 highly , 740-760 \u2192 740\u2013760", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tang_dynasty_art"}

She had warned a dying friend that he should be careful what he said on the phone as authorities could be listening. The jury judged it to be a \"slip of the tongue\", made in a moment of distress without criminal intent. In reply to a question by ABC journalist [[Rachael Kohn]], Rayner described the incident.\n<blockquote>''I was (falsely) accused of acting with the corrupt intention of perverting the course of justice, by visiting a long-term friend of mine who was dying in a hospice.
