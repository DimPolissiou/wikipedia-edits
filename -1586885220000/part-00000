Upon his election, he appointed [[Silvestre Bello III]] as Secretary of the Department of Labor and Employment, who considers making all companies put at least 80% of all employees under contract as per the president's orders. By the end of 2016, around 36000 workers have been regularized. Going into 2017, Duterte and Bello aimed for a new permanent policy that would end labor-only contractualization by the end of February, but Bello wound up not signing it. Instead he decided first for dialogue between the president and labor groups in order to get feedback. Eventually President Duterte met with the labor groups as Bello drafts a new Department Order that would stop labor contractualization. However, by March 16 Bello signs Department Order 174 which sets stricter guidelines on contractualization but doesn't immediately illegalize it. Duterte however continued his stand against contractualization, promising to sign an Executive Order against it. However, the Marawi crisis ends up postponing the signing. As of 2018, no Executive Order has been signed by President Duterte regarding the complete abolishment of contractualization. A rally was organized by labor groups on March 15, 2018 in protest against the president's delay of the EO. Eventually on May 1, Duterte signed an EO that would put an end to contractualization, although labor groups criticized the president for his actions since the one signed was not the draft agreed upon with them.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Tomacruz |first1=Sofia |title=TIMELINE: Duterte's promise to abolish endo |url=https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/iq/201468-duterte-endo-contractualization-promise-2016-to-2018 |website=Rappler |accessdate=9 July 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Land reform===\n{{Empty section|date=December 2019}}\n\n===Law and order===\nOn June 13, 2018, the [[Philippine National Police]] launched \"Oplan RODY\" or \"Rid the Streets of Drunkards and Youths\".

Upon his election, he appointed [[Silvestre Bello III]] as Secretary of the Department of Labor and Employment, who considers making all companies put at least 80% of all employees under contract as per the president's orders. By the end of 2016, around 36000 workers have been regularized. Going into 2017, Duterte and Bello aimed for a new permanent policy that would end labor-only contractualization by the end of February, but Bello wound up not signing it. Instead he decided first for dialogue between the president and labor groups in order to get feedback. Eventually President Duterte met with the labor groups as Bello drafts a new Department Order that would stop labor contractualization. However, by March 16 Bello signs Department Order 174 which sets stricter guidelines on contractualization but doesn't immediately illegalize it. Duterte however continued his stand against contractualization, promising to sign an Executive Order against it. However, the Marawi crisis ends up postponing the signing. As of 2018, no Executive Order has been signed by President Duterte regarding the complete abolishment of contractualization. A rally was organized by labor groups on March 15, 2018 in protest against the president's delay of the EO. Eventually on May 1, Duterte signed an EO that would put an end to contractualization, although labor groups criticized the president for his actions since the one signed was not the draft agreed upon with them.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Tomacruz |first1=Sofia |title=TIMELINE: Duterte's promise to abolish endo |url=https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/iq/201468-duterte-endo-contractualization-promise-2016-to-2018 |website=Rappler |accessdate=9 July 2018}}</ref>\n\n===Land reform===\n{{Empty section|date=December 2019}}\n\n===Law and order===\nOn June 13, 2018, the [[Philippine National Police]] launched \"Oplan RODY\" or \"Rid the Streets of Drunkards and Youths\".
