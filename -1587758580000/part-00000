He began studying piano at the age of five and studied under Boston piano teacher Margaret Chaloff, mother of jazz baritone saxophonist [[Serge Chaloff]], who taught him the \"Russian style\" of piano playing. At an early age he began improvising [[classical music]]. As a teenager he appeared in jazz clubs in the Boston area with [[Coleman Hawkins]], [[Vic Dickenson]], [[Chet Baker]], and Serge Chaloff.\n\nAfter graduating from [[Harvard University|Harvard]], he attended the [[Lenox School of Jazz|Lenox School of Music]] where he was associated with [[Ornette Coleman]], [[Don Cherry (jazz)|Don Cherry]], and [[Gary McFarland]].<ref>[http://www.factmag.com/2014/.../forgotten-classics-steve-kuhn-tranc...] {{dead link|date=March 2020}}</ref> The school's faculty included [[Bill Evans]], [[George Russell (composer)|George Russell]], [[Gunther Schuller]], and the members of the [[Modern Jazz Quartet]]. This allowed Kuhn to play, study, and create with some of the most forward-thinking innovators of jazz improvisation and composition; it culminated with his joining trumpeter [[Kenny Dorham]]'s group for an extended time and (briefly) [[John Coltrane]]'s quartet at New York's Jazz Gallery club.\n\nKuhn also has appeared with [[Stan Getz]], [[Art Farmer]], [[Oliver Nelson]], [[Gary McFarland]], [[Ron Carter]], [[Scott LaFaro]], [[Harvie Swartz]], vocalist [[Shelia Jordan]], [[Billy Drummond]], [[David Finck]], and [[Miroslav Vitous]]. From 1967 to 1971 Kuhn moved to [[Stockholm]], Sweden where he worked with his own trio throughout Europe. In 1971 Kuhn moved back to [[New York City]] and formed a [[quartet]] but continued doing European gigs and appearing at the [[Newport Jazz Festival]].\n\nIn his early years, Kuhn was known as an [[avant-garde jazz]] pianist. He was associated with bassist [[Steve Swallow]] and drummer [[Pete La Roca]] during the 1960s on several notable recordings: ''Three Waves'', under Kuhn's leadership; ''Basra'', under La Roca's leadership, which also featured [[Joe Henderson]]; and ''Sing Me Softly of the Blues'' under flugelhornist [[Art Farmer]]'s leadership. Also notable was Kuhn's inclusion in the quartet on the landmark recording ''Sound Pieces'' led by saxophonist, composer, and arranger Oliver Nelson and including Ron Carter on bass and [[Grady Tate]] on drums. Among other critically acclaimed recordings there was ''The October Suite'' composed by Gary McFarland for Kuhn and an ensemble which included strings, woodwinds, and reeds. The ''Promises Kept'' album features Kuhn's compositions, piano, and strings.\n\nFor decades, Steve Kuhn has led all-star trios that have included such players as bassists Ron Carter and David Finck, and drummers [[Al Foster]], [[Jack DeJohnette]], and [[Joey Baron]]. He has had several live recordings made in some of New York's leading jazz clubs. Kuhn is also the composer of the jazz standard \"The Saga of Harrison Crabfeathers\".\n\nOn June 25, 2019, ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'' listed Steve Kuhn among hundreds of artists whose material was destroyed in the [[2008 Universal fire]].<ref name=\"Rosen2\">{{cite web |last1=Rosen |first1=Jody |title=Here Are Hundreds More Artists Whose Tapes Were Destroyed in the UMG Fire |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/25/magazine/universal-music-fire-bands-list-umg.html |website=The New York Times |accessdate=28 June 2019 |date=25 June 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Discography==\n===As leader/co-leader===\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Year recorded\n!Title\n!Label\n!Notes\n|-\n|1963?\n|''[[The Country and Western Sound of Jazz Pianos]]''\n|Dauntless\n|With [[Toshiko Akiyoshi]] (piano, cello), [[Barry Galbraith]] (guitar), [[David Izenzon]] and John Neves (bass), [[Pete La Roca]] (drums)<ref name=\"disco\">{{cite web |last=Fitzgerald |first=Michael |date=May 13, 2013 |title=Steve Kuhn Discography |publisher= |url=https://jazzdiscography.com/Artists/Kuhn/sk-disc.php |website=jazzdiscography.com |accessdate=February 8, 2019}}</ref>\n|-\n|1966?\n|''Three Waves''\n|Contact\n|Trio, with [[Steve Swallow]] (bass), [[Pete La Roca]] (drums)<ref name=\"disco\" />\n|-\n|1966\n|''[[The October Suite]]''\n|[[Impulse!

He began studying piano at the age of five and studied under Boston piano teacher Margaret Chaloff, mother of jazz baritone saxophonist [[Serge Chaloff]], who taught him the \"Russian style\" of piano playing. At an early age he began improvising [[classical music]]. As a teenager he appeared in jazz clubs in the Boston area with [[Coleman Hawkins]], [[Vic Dickenson]], [[Chet Baker]], and Serge Chaloff.\n\nAfter graduating from [[Harvard University|Harvard]], he attended the [[Lenox School of Jazz|Lenox School of Music]] where he was associated with [[Ornette Coleman]], [[Don Cherry (jazz)|Don Cherry]], and [[Gary McFarland]].<ref>[http://www.factmag.com/2014/.../forgotten-classics-steve-kuhn-tranc...] {{dead link|date=March 2020}}</ref> The school's faculty included [[Bill Evans]], [[George Russell (composer)|George Russell]], [[Gunther Schuller]], and the members of the [[Modern Jazz Quartet]]. This allowed Kuhn to play, study, and create with some of the most forward-thinking innovators of jazz improvisation and composition; it culminated with his joining trumpeter [[Kenny Dorham]]'s group for an extended time and (briefly) [[John Coltrane]]'s quartet at New York's Jazz Gallery club.\n\nKuhn also has appeared with [[Stan Getz]], [[Art Farmer]], [[Oliver Nelson]], [[Gary McFarland]], [[Ron Carter]], [[Scott LaFaro]], [[Harvie Swartz]], vocalist [[Shelia Jordan]], [[Billy Drummond]], [[David Finck]], and [[Miroslav Vitous]]. From 1967 to 1971 Kuhn moved to [[Stockholm]], Sweden where he worked with his own trio throughout Europe. In 1971 Kuhn moved back to [[New York City]] and formed a [[quartet]] but continued doing European gigs and appearing at the [[Newport Jazz Festival]].\n\nIn his early years, Kuhn was known as an [[avant-garde jazz]] pianist. He was associated with bassist [[Steve Swallow]] and drummer [[Pete La Roca]] during the 1960s on several notable recordings: ''Three Waves'', under Kuhn's leadership; ''Basra'', under La Roca's leadership, which also featured [[Joe Henderson]]; and ''Sing Me Softly of the Blues'' under flugelhornist [[Art Farmer]]'s leadership. Also notable was Kuhn's inclusion in the quartet on the landmark recording ''Sound Pieces'' led by saxophonist, composer, and arranger Oliver Nelson and including Ron Carter on bass and [[Grady Tate]] on drums. Among other critically acclaimed recordings there was ''The October Suite'' composed by Gary McFarland for Kuhn and an ensemble which included strings, woodwinds, and reeds. The ''Promises Kept'' album features Kuhn's compositions, piano, and strings.\n\nFor decades, Steve Kuhn has led all-star trios that have included such players as bassists Ron Carter and David Finck, and drummers [[Al Foster]], [[Jack DeJohnette]], and [[Joey Baron]]. He has had several live recordings made in some of New York's leading jazz clubs. Kuhn is also the composer of the jazz standard \"The Saga of Harrison Crabfeathers\".\n\nOn June 25, 2019, ''[[The New York Times Magazine]]'' listed Steve Kuhn among hundreds of artists whose material was reportedly destroyed in the [[2008 Universal fire]].<ref name=\"Rosen2\">{{cite web |last1=Rosen |first1=Jody |title=Here Are Hundreds More Artists Whose Tapes Were Destroyed in the UMG Fire |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2019/06/25/magazine/universal-music-fire-bands-list-umg.html |website=The New York Times |accessdate=28 June 2019 |date=25 June 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Discography==\n===As leader/co-leader===\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n!Year recorded\n!Title\n!Label\n!Notes\n|-\n|1963?\n|''[[The Country and Western Sound of Jazz Pianos]]''\n|Dauntless\n|With [[Toshiko Akiyoshi]] (piano, cello), [[Barry Galbraith]] (guitar), [[David Izenzon]] and John Neves (bass), [[Pete La Roca]] (drums)<ref name=\"disco\">{{cite web |last=Fitzgerald |first=Michael |date=May 13, 2013 |title=Steve Kuhn Discography |publisher= |url=https://jazzdiscography.com/Artists/Kuhn/sk-disc.php |website=jazzdiscography.com |accessdate=February 8, 2019}}</ref>\n|-\n|1966?\n|''Three Waves''\n|Contact\n|Trio, with [[Steve Swallow]] (bass), [[Pete La Roca]] (drums)<ref name=\"disco\" />\n|-\n|1966\n|''[[The October Suite]]''\n|[[Impulse!

From this year forward, the appointment of particular Roman consuls was abandoned and the office was merged with that of Byzantine emperor. Thus, the consular year dating was abandoned in practice, even though it formally remained until the end of the 9th century. The denomination 542 for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the [[Anno Domini]] [[calendar era]] became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.\n\n== Events ==\n<onlyinclude>\n\n=== By place ===\n==== Byzantine Empire ====\n* [[Plague of Justinian]]: [[Bubonic plague]], spread from [[Egypt]], kills at least 230,000 in [[Constantinople]] (before counting stops), and perhaps two million or more in the rest of the empire. Emperor [[Justinian I]] contracts the disease but recovers.\n* [[Lazic War]] &ndash; Justinian I sends a Byzantine army (30,000 men) to [[Armenia]]. The [[Sassanid Empire|Persians]], severely outnumbered, are forced to retreat, but at [[Dvin (ancient city)|Dvin]] the [[Byzantine Greeks|Byzantines]] are defeated by a force of 4,000 men in an [[ambush]], and are completely routed.<ref name=\"farrokh3\">Farrokh 2007, p. 235</ref>\n\n==== Europe ====\n* Spring &ndash; [[Battle of Faventia]]: King [[Totila]] scatters with 5,000 men the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] forces near Faventia (modern [[Faenza]]), beginning the resurgence of [[Ostrogoths|Gothic]] resistance to the [[Gothic War (535\u2013554)|reconquest of Italy]].\n* [[Battle of Mucellium]]: Totila marches down into [[Tuscany]] and defeats the Byzantines at [[Florence]], in the valley of [[Mugello region|Mugello]]. He treats his prisoners well, and many are induced to join his [[banner]].\n* [[March]] &ndash; Totila bypasses [[Rome]] and begins his expedition in [[Southern Italy]].<ref>J.B. Bury, 1923. ''History of the later Roman Empire'', chapter XIX</ref> He captures [[Benevento|Beneventum]] and receives the submission of the provinces of [[Apulia]], [[Lucania]] and [[Calabria|Bruttium]].\n* [[Siege of Naples (542\u2013543)|Siege of Naples]]: Totila [[Siege|besiege]]s the city of [[Naples]] in [[Campania]]. A Byzantine relief force from [[Sicily]] is intercepted and almost destroyed by Gothic [[warship]]s.\n* King [[Childebert I]] and his brother [[Chlothar I]] invade [[Visigoth Kingdom|Visigothic Spain]]. They capture [[Pamplona]], but [[Zaragoza]] withstands a siege and the [[Franks]] retreat to [[Gaul]].

From this year forward, the appointment of particular Roman consuls was abandoned and the office was merged with that of Byzantine emperor. Thus, the consular year dating was abandoned in practice, even though it formally remained until the end of the 9th century. The denomination 542 for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the [[Anno Domini]] [[calendar era]] became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.\n\n== Events ==\n<onlyinclude>\n\n=== By place ===\n==== Byzantine Empire ====\n* [[Plague of Justinian]]: [[Bubonic plague]], spread from [[Egypt]], kills at least 230,000 in [[Constantinople]] (before counting stops), and perhaps two million or more in the rest of the empire.

He treats his prisoners well, and many are induced to join his [[banner]].\n* March &ndash; Totila bypasses [[Rome]] and begins his expedition in [[Southern Italy]].<ref>J.B. Bury, 1923.
