{"title_page": "Euclidean geometry", "text_new": "{{short description|Mathematical system attributed to Euclid}}\n{{redirect|Plane geometry}}\n[[File:Sanzio 01 Euclid.jpg|thumb|236px<!--(approx Sidebar/Infobox)-->|Detail from [[Raphael]]'s ''[[The School of Athens]]'' featuring a Greek mathematician \u2013&nbsp;perhaps representing [[Euclid]] or [[Archimedes]]&nbsp;\u2013 using a [[Compass (drafting)|compass]] to draw a geometric construction.]]\n{{General geometry |branches}}\n'''Euclidean geometry''' is a mathematical system attributed to [[Alexandria]]n [[Greek mathematics|Greek mathematician]] [[Euclid]], which he described in his textbook on [[geometry]]: the ''[[Euclid's Elements|Elements]]''. Euclid's method consists in assuming a small set of intuitively appealing [[axiom]]s, and deducing many other [[proposition]]s ([[theorem]]s) from these. Although many of Euclid's results had been stated by earlier mathematicians,<ref name = eves1_19>{{harvnb|Eves|1963|loc=p. 19}}</ref> Euclid was the first to show how these propositions could fit into a comprehensive [[deductive]] and [[logical system]].<ref>{{harvnb|Eves|1963|loc=p. 10}}</ref> The ''Elements'' begins with plane geometry, still taught in [[secondary school]] (high school) as the first [[axiomatic system]] and the first examples of [[Mathematical proof|formal proof]]. It goes on to the [[solid geometry]] of [[three dimensions]]. Much of the ''Elements'' states results of what are now called [[algebra]] and [[number theory]], explained in geometrical language.<ref name = eves1_19/>\n\nFor more than two thousand years, the adjective \"Euclidean\" was unnecessary because no other sort of geometry had been conceived. Euclid's axioms seemed so intuitively obvious (with the possible exception of the [[parallel postulate]]) that any theorem proved from them was deemed true in an absolute, often metaphysical, sense. Today, however, many other [[self-consistent]] [[non-Euclidean geometry|non-Euclidean geometries]] are known, the first ones having been discovered in the early 19th century. An implication of [[Albert Einstein]]'s theory of [[general relativity]] is that physical space itself is not Euclidean, and [[Three-dimensional space|Euclidean space]] is a good approximation for it only over short distances (relative to the strength of the  [[gravity|gravitational field]]).<ref>Misner, Thorne, and Wheeler (1973), p.&nbsp;47</ref>\n\nEuclidean geometry is an example of [[synthetic geometry]], in that it proceeds logically from axioms describing basic properties of geometric objects such as points and lines, to propositions about those objects, all without the use of [[coordinate system|coordinates]] to specify those objects. This is in contrast to [[analytic geometry]], which uses coordinates to translate geometric propositions into algebraic formulas.\n\n==The ''Elements''==\n{{main|Euclid's Elements}}\nThe ''Elements'' is mainly a systematization of earlier knowledge of geometry. Its improvement over earlier treatments was rapidly recognized, with the result that there was little interest in preserving the earlier ones, and they are now nearly all lost.\n\nThere are 13 books in the ''Elements'':\n\nBooks I\u2013IV and VI discuss plane geometry. Many results about plane figures are proved, for example \"In any triangle two angles taken together in any manner are less than two right angles.\" (Book 1 proposition 17) and the [[Pythagorean theorem]] \"In right angled triangles the square on the side subtending the right angle is equal to the squares on the sides containing the right angle.\" (Book I, proposition 47)\n\nBooks V and VII\u2013X deal with [[number theory]], with numbers treated geometrically as lengths of line segments or areas of regions. Notions such as [[prime numbers]] and [[rational number|rational]] and [[irrational number]]s are introduced. It is proved that there are infinitely many prime numbers.\n\nBooks XI\u2013XIII concern [[solid geometry]]. A typical result is the 1:3 ratio between the volume of a cone and a cylinder with the same height and base. The [[platonic solid]]s are constructed.\n\n===Axioms===\n[[File:Parallel postulate en.svg|thumb|The parallel postulate (Postulate 5): If two lines intersect a third in such a way that the sum of the inner angles on one side is less than two right angles, then the two lines inevitably must intersect each other on that side if extended far enough.]]\n\nEuclidean geometry is an [[axiomatic system]], in which all [[theorem|theorems]] (\"true statements\") are derived from a small number of simple axioms. Until the advent of [[non-Euclidean geometry]], these axioms were considered to be obviously true in the physical world, so that all the theorems would be equally true. However, Euclid's reasoning from assumptions to conclusions remains valid independent of their physical reality.<ref name=Wolfe>The assumptions of Euclid are discussed from a modern perspective in \n{{cite book |title=Introduction to Non-Euclidean Geometry |author=Harold E. Wolfe |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VPHn3MutWhQC&pg=PA9 |page=9 |isbn=1-4067-1852-1 |year=2007 |publisher=Mill Press}}\n</ref>\n\nNear the beginning of the first book of the ''Elements'', Euclid gives five [[axiom|postulates]] (axioms) for plane geometry, stated in terms of constructions (as translated by Thomas Heath):<ref>tr. Heath, pp. 195\u2013202.</ref>\n\n:Let the following be postulated:\n# To draw a [[line (geometry)|straight line]] from any [[point (geometry)|point]] to any point.\n# To produce (extend) a [[Line segment|finite straight line]] continuously in a straight line.\n# To describe a [[circle]] with any centre and distance (radius).\n# That all [[right angle]]s are equal to one another.\n# [The [[parallel postulate]]]: That, if a straight line falling on two straight lines make the interior angles on the same side less than two right angles, the two straight lines, if produced indefinitely, meet on that side on which the angles are less than two right angles.\n\nAlthough Euclid only explicitly asserts the existence of the constructed objects, in his reasoning they are implicitly assumed to be unique.\n\nThe ''Elements'' also include the following five \"common notions\":\n\n# Things that are equal to the same thing are also equal to one another (the [[Transitive property]] of a [[Euclidean relation]]).\n# If equals are added to equals, then the wholes are equal (Addition property of equality).\n# If equals are subtracted from equals, then the differences are equal (Subtraction property of equality).\n# Things that coincide with one another are equal to one another (Reflexive property).\n# The whole is greater than the part.\n\nModern scholars agree that Euclid's postulates do not provide the complete logical foundation that Euclid required for his presentation.<ref>{{citation|first=Gerard A.|last=Venema|title=Foundations of Geometry|year=2006|publisher=Prentice-Hall|page=8|isbn=978-0-13-143700-5}}</ref> Modern [[Foundations of geometry|treatments]] use more extensive and complete sets of axioms.\n\n===Parallel postulate===\n{{main|Parallel postulate}}\nTo the ancients, the parallel postulate seemed less obvious than the others. They aspired to create a system of absolutely certain propositions, and to them it seemed as if the parallel line postulate required proof from simpler statements. It is now known that such a proof is impossible, since one can construct consistent systems of geometry (obeying the other axioms) in which the parallel postulate is true, and others in which it is false.<ref>{{Citation|title=History of the Parallel Postulate|journal=The American Mathematical Monthly|volume=27|issue=1|pages=16\u201323|date=Jan 1920|author=Florence P. Lewis|doi=10.2307/2973238|publisher=The American Mathematical Monthly, Vol. 27, No. 1|postscript=.|jstor=2973238}}</ref> Euclid himself seems to have considered it as being qualitatively different from the others, as evidenced by the organization of the ''Elements'': his first 28 propositions are those that can be proved without it.\n\nMany alternative axioms can be formulated which are [[logical equivalence|logically equivalent]] to the parallel postulate (in the context of the other axioms). For example, [[Playfair's axiom]] states:\n\n:In a [[Plane (geometry)|plane]], through a point not on a given straight line, at most one line can be drawn that never meets the given line.\n\nThe \"at most\" clause is all that is needed since it can be proved from the remaining axioms that at least one parallel line exists.\n\n[[File:euclid-proof.svg|thumb|A proof from Euclid's ''Elements'' that, given a line segment, one may construct an equilateral triangle that includes the segment as one of its sides: an equilateral triangle \u0391\u0392\u0393 is made by drawing circles \u0394 and \u0395 centered on the points \u0391 and \u0392, and taking one intersection of the circles as the third vertex of the triangle.]]\n\n==Methods of proof==\nEuclidean Geometry is ''[[Constructive proof|constructive]]''. Postulates 1, 2, 3, and 5 assert the existence and uniqueness of certain geometric figures, and these assertions are of a constructive nature: that is, we are not only told that certain things exist, but are also given methods for creating them with no more than a [[compass and straightedge|compass and an unmarked straightedge]].<ref>Ball, p.&nbsp;56</ref> In this sense, Euclidean geometry is more concrete than many modern axiomatic systems such as [[set theory]], which often assert the existence of objects without saying how to construct them, or even assert the existence of objects that cannot be constructed within the theory.<ref name=set_theory>Within Euclid's assumptions, it is quite easy to give a formula for area of triangles and squares. However, in a more general context like set theory, it is not as easy to prove that the area of a square is the sum of areas of its pieces, for example. See [[Lebesgue measure]] and [[Banach\u2013Tarski paradox]].</ref> Strictly speaking, the lines on paper are ''[[Scientific modelling|models]]'' of the objects defined within the formal system, rather than instances of those objects. For example, a Euclidean straight line has no width, but any real drawn line will. Though nearly all modern mathematicians consider [[Existence theorem|nonconstructive methods]] just as sound as constructive ones, Euclid's constructive proofs often supplanted fallacious nonconstructive ones\u2014e.g., some of the Pythagoreans' proofs that involved irrational numbers, which usually required a statement such as \"Find the greatest common measure of ...\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Daniel Shanks|title=Solved and Unsolved Problems in Number Theory|year=2002|publisher=American Mathematical Society}}</ref>\n\nEuclid often used [[proof by contradiction]]. Euclidean geometry also allows the method of superposition, in which a figure is transferred to another point in space. For example, proposition I.4, side-angle-side congruence of triangles, is proved by moving one of the two triangles so that one of its sides coincides with the other triangle's equal side, and then proving that the other sides coincide as well. Some modern treatments add a sixth postulate, the rigidity of the triangle, which can be used as an alternative to superposition.<ref>Coxeter, p.&nbsp;5</ref>\n\n==System of measurement and arithmetic==\nEuclidean geometry has two fundamental types of measurements: [[angle]] and [[Euclidean distance|distance]]. The angle scale is absolute, and Euclid uses the [[right angle]] as his basic unit, so that, for example, a 45-[[degree (angle)|degree]] angle would be referred to as half of a right angle. The distance scale is relative; one arbitrarily picks a line segment with a certain nonzero length as the unit, and other distances are expressed in relation to it. Addition of distances is represented by a construction in which one line segment is copied onto the end of another line segment to extend its length, and similarly for subtraction.\n\nMeasurements of [[area (geometry)|area]] and [[volume]] are derived from distances. For example, a [[rectangle]] with a width of 3 and a length of 4 has an area that represents the product, 12. Because this geometrical interpretation of multiplication was limited to three dimensions, there was no direct way of interpreting the product of four or more numbers, and Euclid avoided such products, although they are implied, for example in the proof of book IX, proposition 20.\n\n[[File:Congruentie.svg|thumb|An example of congruence. The two figures on the left are congruent, while the third is [[Similarity (geometry)|similar]] to them. The last figure is neither. Congruences alter some properties, such as location and orientation, but leave others unchanged, like [[distance]] and [[angle]]s. The latter sort of properties are called [[invariant (mathematics)|invariant]]s and studying them is the essence of geometry.]]\nEuclid refers to a pair of lines, or a pair of planar or solid figures, as \"equal\" (\u1f34\u03c3\u03bf\u03c2) if their lengths, areas, or volumes are equal respectively, and similarly for angles. The stronger term \"[[congruence (geometry)|congruent]]\" refers to the idea that an entire figure is the same size and shape as another figure. Alternatively, two figures are congruent if one can be moved on top of the other so that it matches up with it exactly. (Flipping it over is allowed.) Thus, for example, a 2x6 rectangle and a 3x4 rectangle are equal but not congruent, and the letter R is congruent to its mirror image. Figures that would be congruent except for their differing sizes are referred to as [[similarity (geometry)|similar]]. [[corresponding sides and corresponding angles|Corresponding angles]] in a pair of similar shapes are congruent and [[corresponding sides]] are in proportion to each other.\n\n==Notation and terminology==\n\n===Naming of points and figures===\nPoints are customarily named using capital letters of the alphabet. Other figures, such as lines, triangles, or circles, are named by listing a sufficient number of points to pick them out unambiguously from the relevant figure, e.g., triangle ABC would typically be a triangle with vertices at points A, B, and C.\n\n=== Complementary and supplementary angles ===\nAngles whose sum is a right angle are called [[Complementary angles|complementary]]. Complementary angles are formed when a ray shares the same vertex and is pointed in a direction that is in between the two original rays that form the right angle. The number of rays in between the two original rays is infinite.\n\nAngles whose sum is a straight angle are [[Supplementary angles|supplementary]]. Supplementary angles are formed when a ray shares the same vertex and is pointed in a direction that is in between the two original rays that form the straight angle (180 degree angle). The number of rays in between the two original rays is infinite.\n\n=== Modern versions of Euclid's notation ===\nIn modern terminology, angles would normally be measured in [[degree (angle)|degree]]s or [[radian]]s.\n\nModern school textbooks often define separate figures called [[line (geometry)|line]]s (infinite), [[Line (mathematics)#Ray|rays]] (semi-infinite), and [[line segment]]s (of finite length). Euclid, rather than discussing a ray as an object that extends to infinity in one direction, would normally use locutions such as \"if the line is extended to a sufficient length,\" although he occasionally referred to \"infinite lines\". A \"line\" in Euclid could be either straight or curved, and he used the more specific term \"straight line\" when necessary.\n\n== Some important or well known results ==\n<gallery perrow=\"4\">\nFile:pons_asinorum_dzmanto.png|The ''[[pons asinorum]]'' or ''bridge of asses theorem''' states that in an isosceles triangle, \u03b1&nbsp;=&nbsp;\u03b2 and \u03b3&nbsp;=&nbsp;\u03b4.\nFile:Sum_of_angles_of_triangle_dzmanto.png|The ''triangle angle sum theorem'' states that the sum of the three angles of any triangle, in this case angles \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3, will always equal 180 degrees.\nFile:Pythagorean.svg|The ''[[Pythagorean theorem]]'' states that the sum of the areas of the two squares on the legs (''a'' and ''b'') of a right triangle equals the area of the square on the hypotenuse (''c'').\nFile:Thales' Theorem Simple.svg|''[[Thales' theorem]]'' states that if AC is a diameter, then the angle at B is a right angle.\n</gallery>\n\n===Pons Asinorum===\nThe [[pons asinorum]] (''bridge of asses'') states that ''in isosceles triangles the angles at the base equal one another, and, if the equal straight lines are produced further, then the angles under the base equal one another.''<ref>Euclid, book I, proposition 5, tr. Heath, p.&nbsp;251</ref> Its name may be attributed to its frequent role as the first real test in the ''Elements'' of the intelligence of the reader and as a bridge to the harder propositions that followed. It might also be so named because of the geometrical figure's resemblance to a steep bridge that only a sure-footed donkey could cross.<ref>Ignoring the alleged difficulty of Book I, Proposition 5, [[T. L. Heath|Sir Thomas L. Heath]] mentions another interpretation. This rests on the resemblance of the figure's lower straight lines to a steeply inclined bridge that could be crossed by an ass but not by a horse: \"But there is another view (as I have learnt lately) which is more complimentary to the ass. It is that, the figure of the proposition being like that of a trestle bridge, with a ramp at each end which is more practicable the flatter the figure is drawn, the bridge is such that, while a horse could not surmount the ramp, an ass could; in other words, the term is meant to refer to the sure-footedness of the ass rather than to any want of intelligence on his part.\" (in \"Excursis II,\" volume 1 of Heath's translation of ''The Thirteen Books of the Elements''.)</ref>\n\n===Congruence of triangles===\n[[File:Congruent triangles.svg|thumb|right|Congruence of triangles is determined by specifying two sides and the angle between them (SAS), two angles and the side between them (ASA) or two angles and a corresponding adjacent side (AAS). Specifying two sides and an adjacent angle (SSA), however, can yield two distinct possible triangles unless the angle specified is a right angle.]]\n\nTriangles are congruent if they have all three sides equal (SSS), two sides and the angle between them equal (SAS), or two angles and a side equal (ASA) (Book I, propositions 4, 8, and 26). Triangles with three equal angles (AAA) are similar, but not necessarily congruent. Also, triangles with two equal sides and an adjacent angle are not necessarily equal or congruent.\n\n===Triangle angle sum===\nThe sum of the angles of a triangle is equal to a straight angle (180 degrees).<ref>Euclid, book I, proposition 32</ref> This causes an equilateral triangle to have three interior angles of 60 degrees. Also, it causes every triangle to have at least two acute angles and up to one [[obtuse angle|obtuse]] or [[right angle]].\n\n===Pythagorean theorem===\nThe celebrated [[Pythagorean theorem]] (book I, proposition 47) states that in any right triangle, the area of the square whose side is the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the areas of the squares whose sides are the two legs (the two sides that meet at a right angle).\n\n===Thales' theorem===\n[[Thales' theorem]], named after [[Thales of Miletus]] states that if A, B, and C are points on a circle where the line AC is a diameter of the circle, then the angle ABC is a right angle. Cantor supposed that Thales proved his theorem by means of Euclid Book I, Prop. 32 after the manner of Euclid Book III, Prop. 31.<ref>Heath, p.&nbsp;135. [https://books.google.com/books?id=drnY3Vjix3kC&pg=PA135 Extract of page 135]</ref><ref>Heath, p.&nbsp;318</ref>\n\n===Scaling of area and volume===\nIn modern terminology, the area of a plane figure is proportional to the square of any of its linear dimensions, <math>A \\propto L^2</math>, and the volume of a solid to the cube, <math>V \\propto L^3</math>. Euclid proved these results in various special cases such as the area of a circle<ref>Euclid, book XII, proposition 2</ref> and the volume of a parallelepipedal solid.<ref>Euclid, book XI, proposition 33</ref> Euclid determined some, but not all, of the relevant constants of proportionality. E.g., it was his successor [[Archimedes]] who proved that a sphere has 2/3 the volume of the circumscribing cylinder.<ref>Ball, p.&nbsp;66</ref>\n\n==Applications==\n{{Expand section|date=March 2009}}\nBecause of Euclidean geometry's fundamental status in mathematics, it is impractical to give more than a representative sampling of applications here.\n\n<gallery perrow=\"3\">\nFile:us land survey officer.jpg|A surveyor uses a [[Dumpy level|level]]\nFile:Ambersweet oranges.jpg|[[Sphere packing]] applies to a stack of [[orange (fruit)|orange]]s.\nFile:Parabola with focus and arbitrary line.svg|A parabolic mirror brings parallel rays of light to a focus.\n</gallery>\n\nAs suggested by the etymology of the word, one of the earliest reasons for interest in geometry was [[surveying]],<ref>Ball, p.&nbsp;5</ref> and certain practical results from Euclidean geometry, such as the right-angle property of the 3-4-5 triangle, were used long before they were proved formally.<ref>Eves, vol. 1, p.&nbsp;5; Mlodinow, p.&nbsp;7</ref> The fundamental types of measurements in Euclidean geometry are distances and angles, both of which can be measured directly by a surveyor. Historically, distances were often measured by chains, such as [[Gunter's chain]], and angles using graduated circles and, later, the [[theodolite]].\n\nAn application of Euclidean solid geometry is the [[packing problem|determination of packing arrangements]], such as the problem of finding the most efficient [[sphere packing|packing of spheres]] in n dimensions. This problem has applications in [[error detection and correction]].\n\n[[Geometric optics]] uses Euclidean geometry to analyze the focusing of light by lenses and mirrors.\n\n<gallery perrow=\"3\">\nFile:Damascus Khan asad Pacha cropped.jpg|Geometry is used in art and architecture.\nFile:Water tower cropped.jpg|The water tower consists of a cone, a cylinder, and a hemisphere.

Design geometry typically consists of shapes bounded by planes, cylinders, cones, tori, etc. In the present day, CAD/CAM is essential in the design of almost everything, including cars, airplanes, ships, and smartphones. A few decades ago, sophisticated draftsmen learned some fairly advanced Euclidean geometry, including things like Pascal's theorem and Brianchon's theorem. But now they don't have to, because the geometric constructions are all done by CAD programs.\n\n<gallery>\nFile:Motor partsolutions.gif\n</gallery>\n\n==As a description of the structure of space==\nEuclid believed that his [[axioms]] were self-evident statements about physical reality.

Modern, more rigorous reformulations of the system<ref>e.g., Tarski (1951)</ref> typically aim for a cleaner separation of these issues. Interpreting Euclid's axioms in the spirit of this more modern approach, axioms 1-4 are consistent with either infinite or finite space (as in [[elliptic geometry]]), and all five axioms are consistent with a variety of topologies (e.g., a plane, a cylinder, or a [[torus]] for two-dimensional Euclidean geometry).\n\n==Later work==\n\n===Archimedes and Apollonius===\n[[File:Archimedes sphere and cylinder.svg|thumb|right|A sphere has 2/3 the volume and surface area of its circumscribing cylinder. A sphere and cylinder were placed on the tomb of Archimedes at his request.]]\n[[Archimedes]] (c. 287 BCE \u2013 c. 212 BCE), a colorful figure about whom many historical anecdotes are recorded, is remembered along with Euclid as one of the greatest of ancient mathematicians. Although the foundations of his work were put in place by Euclid, his work, unlike Euclid's, is believed to have been entirely original.<ref>Eves, p.&nbsp;27</ref> He proved equations for the volumes and areas of various figures in two and three dimensions, and enunciated the [[Archimedean property]] of finite numbers.\n\n[[Apollonius of Perga]] (c. 262 BCE \u2013 c. 190 BCE) is mainly known for his investigation of conic sections.\n\n[[File:Frans Hals - Portret van Ren\u00e9 Descartes.jpg|thumb|left|Ren\u00e9 Descartes. Portrait after [[Frans Hals]], 1648.]]\n\n===17th century: Descartes===\n[[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]] (1596\u20131650) developed [[analytic geometry]], an alternative method for formalizing geometry which focused on turning geometry into algebra.<ref>Ball, pp. 268ff</ref>\n\nIn this approach, a point on a plane is represented by its [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian]] (''x'', ''y'') coordinates, a line is represented by its equation, and so on.\n\nIn Euclid's original approach, the [[Pythagorean theorem]] follows from Euclid's axioms. In the Cartesian approach, the axioms are the axioms of algebra, and the equation expressing the Pythagorean theorem is then a definition of one of the terms in Euclid's axioms, which are now considered theorems.\n\nThe equation\n:<math>|PQ|=\\sqrt{(p_x-q_x)^2+(p_y-q_y)^2} \\, </math>\ndefining the distance between two points ''P'' = (''p<sub>x</sub>'', ''p<sub>y</sub>'') and ''Q'' = (''q<sub>x</sub>'', ''q<sub>y</sub>'') is then known as the ''Euclidean [[metric space|metric]]'', and other metrics define [[non-Euclidean geometry|non-Euclidean geometries]].\n\nIn terms of analytic geometry, the restriction of classical geometry to compass and straightedge constructions means a restriction to first- and second-order equations, e.g., ''y'' = 2''x'' + 1 (a line), or ''x''<sup>2</sup> + ''y''<sup>2</sup> = 7 (a circle).\n\nAlso in the 17th century, [[Girard Desargues]], motivated by the theory of [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]], introduced the concept of idealized points, lines, and planes at infinity. The result can be considered as a type of generalized geometry, [[projective geometry]], but it can also be used to produce proofs in ordinary Euclidean geometry in which the number of special cases is reduced.<ref>Eves (1963)</ref>\n\n[[File:Squaring the circle.svg|right|thumb|Squaring the circle: the areas of this square and this circle are equal. In 1882, it was proven that this figure cannot be constructed in a finite number of steps with an idealized [[compass and straightedge]].]]\n\n===18th century===\nGeometers of the 18th century struggled to define the boundaries of the Euclidean system. Many tried in vain to prove the fifth postulate from the first four. By 1763, at least 28 different proofs had been published, but all were found incorrect.<ref>Hofstadter 1979, p.&nbsp;91.</ref>\n\nLeading up to this period, geometers also tried to determine what constructions could be accomplished in Euclidean geometry. For example, the problem of [[trisecting an angle]] with a compass and straightedge is one that naturally occurs within the theory, since the axioms refer to constructive operations that can be carried out with those tools. However, centuries of efforts failed to find a solution to this problem, until [[Pierre Wantzel]] published a proof in 1837 that such a construction was impossible. Other constructions that were proved impossible include [[doubling the cube]] and [[squaring the circle]]. In the case of doubling the cube, the impossibility of the construction originates from the fact that the compass and straightedge method involve equations whose order is an integral power of two,<ref>Theorem 120, Elements of Abstract Algebra, Allan Clark, Dover, {{ISBN|0-486-64725-0}}</ref> while doubling a cube requires the solution of a third-order equation.\n\n[[Leonhard Euler|Euler]] discussed a generalization of Euclidean geometry called [[affine geometry]], which retains the fifth postulate unmodified while weakening postulates three and four in a way that eliminates the notions of angle (whence right triangles become meaningless) and of equality of length of line segments in general (whence circles become meaningless) while retaining the notions of parallelism as an equivalence relation between lines, and equality of length of parallel line segments (so line segments continue to have a midpoint).\n\n===19th century and non-Euclidean geometry===\nIn the early 19th century, [[Lazare Carnot|Carnot]] and [[August Ferdinand M\u00f6bius|M\u00f6bius]] systematically developed the use of signed angles and line segments as a way of simplifying and unifying results.<ref>Eves (1963), p.&nbsp;64</ref>\n\nThe century's most significant development in geometry occurred when, around 1830, [[J\u00e1nos Bolyai]] and [[Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky]] separately published work on [[non-Euclidean geometry]], in which the parallel postulate is not valid.<ref>Ball, p.&nbsp;485</ref> Since non-Euclidean geometry is provably relatively consistent with Euclidean geometry, the parallel postulate cannot be proved from the other postulates.\n\nIn the 19th century, it was also realized that Euclid's ten axioms and common notions do not suffice to prove all of the theorems stated in the ''Elements''. For example, Euclid assumed implicitly that any line contains at least two points, but this assumption cannot be proved from the other axioms, and therefore must be an axiom itself. The very first geometric proof in the ''Elements,'' shown in the figure above, is that any line segment is part of a triangle; Euclid constructs this in the usual way, by drawing circles around both endpoints and taking their intersection as the third [[wikt:vertex|vertex]]. His axioms, however, do not guarantee that the circles actually intersect, because they do not assert the geometrical property of continuity, which in Cartesian terms is equivalent to the [[Real number#Completeness|completeness]] property of the real numbers. Starting with [[Moritz Pasch]] in 1882, many improved axiomatic systems for geometry have been proposed, the best known being those of [[Hilbert's axioms|Hilbert]],<ref>* [[Howard Eves]], 1997 (1958).

In a 1919 test of the general theory of relativity, stars (marked with short horizontal lines) were photographed during a solar [[eclipse]]. The rays of starlight were bent by the Sun's gravity on their way to the earth. This is interpreted as evidence in favor of Einstein's prediction that gravity would cause deviations from Euclidean geometry.]]\n[[Albert Einstein|Einstein's]] theory of [[special relativity]] involves a four-dimensional [[space-time]], the [[Minkowski space]], which is [[non-Euclidean geometry|non-Euclidean]]. This shows that non-Euclidean geometries, which were introduced a few years earlier for showing that the [[parallel postulate]] cannot be proved, are also useful for describing the physical world.\n\nHowever, the three-dimensional \"space part\" of the Minkowski space remains the space of Euclidean geometry. This is not the case with [[general relativity]], for which the geometry of the space part of space-time is not Euclidean geometry.<ref>Misner, Thorne, and Wheeler (1973), p.&nbsp;191</ref> For example, if a triangle is constructed out of three rays of light, then in general the interior angles do not add up to 180 degrees due to gravity. A relatively weak gravitational field, such as the Earth's or the sun's, is represented by a metric that is approximately, but not exactly, Euclidean. Until the 20th century, there was no technology capable of detecting the deviations from Euclidean geometry, but Einstein predicted that such deviations would exist. They were later verified by observations such as the slight bending of starlight by the Sun during a solar eclipse in 1919, and such considerations are now an integral part of the software that runs the [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] system.<ref>Rizos, Chris.

However, he typically did not make such distinctions unless they were necessary. The postulates do not explicitly refer to infinite lines, although for example some commentators interpret postulate 3, existence of a circle with any radius, as implying that space is infinite.<ref name=\"Heath, p.&nbsp;200\"/>\n\nThe notion of [[infinitesimals|infinitesimal quantities]] had previously been discussed extensively by the [[Eleatic School]], but nobody had been able to put them on a firm logical basis, with paradoxes such as [[Zeno's paradox]] occurring that had not been resolved to universal satisfaction. Euclid used the [[method of exhaustion]] rather than infinitesimals.<ref>Ball, p.&nbsp;31</ref>\n\nLater ancient commentators, such as [[Proclus]] (410\u2013485 CE), treated many questions about infinity as issues demanding proof and, e.g., Proclus claimed to prove the infinite divisibility of a line, based on a proof by contradiction in which he considered the cases of even and odd numbers of points constituting it.<ref>Heath, p.&nbsp;268</ref>\n\nAt the turn of the 20th century, [[Otto Stolz]], [[Paul du Bois-Reymond]], [[Giuseppe Veronese]], and others produced controversial work on [[Archimedean property|non-Archimedean]] models of Euclidean geometry, in which the distance between two points may be infinite or infinitesimal, in the [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]\u2013[[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]] sense.<ref>Giuseppe Veronese, On Non-Archimedean Geometry, 1908.

Non-standard analysis.</ref>\n\n===Infinite processes===\nOne reason that the ancients treated the parallel postulate as less certain than the others is that verifying it physically would require us to inspect two lines to check that they never intersected, even at some very distant point, and this inspection could potentially take an infinite amount of time.<ref>For the assertion that this was the historical reason for the ancients considering the parallel postulate less obvious than the others, see Nagel and Newman 1958, p.&nbsp;9.</ref>\n\nThe modern formulation of [[proof by induction]] was not developed until the 17th century, but some later commentators consider it implicit in some of Euclid's proofs, e.g., the proof of the infinitude of primes.<ref>Cajori (1918), p.&nbsp;197</ref>\n\nSupposed paradoxes involving infinite series, such as [[Zeno's paradox]], predated Euclid.

Euclid's method consists in assuming a small set of intuitively appealing [[axiom]]s, and deducing many other [[proposition]]s ([[theorem]]s) from these. Although many of Euclid's results had been stated by earlier mathematicians,<ref name = eves1_19>{{harvnb|Eves|1963|loc=p. 19}}</ref> Euclid was the first to show how these propositions could fit into a comprehensive [[deductive]] and [[logical system]].<ref>{{harvnb|Eves|1963|loc=p. 10}}</ref> The ''Elements'' begins with plane geometry, still taught in [[secondary school]] (high school) as the first [[axiomatic system]] and the first examples of [[Mathematical proof|formal proof]]. It goes on to the [[solid geometry]] of [[three dimensions]]. Much of the ''Elements'' states results of what are now called [[algebra]] and [[number theory]], explained in geometrical language.<ref name = eves1_19/>\n\nFor more than two thousand years, the adjective \"Euclidean\" was unnecessary because no other sort of geometry had been conceived. Euclid's axioms seemed so intuitively obvious (with the possible exception of the [[parallel postulate]]) that any theorem proved from them was deemed true in an absolute, often metaphysical, sense. Today, however, many other [[self-consistent]] [[non-Euclidean geometry|non-Euclidean geometries]] are known, the first ones having been discovered in the early 19th century. An implication of [[Albert Einstein]]'s theory of [[general relativity]] is that physical space itself is not Euclidean, and [[Three-dimensional space|Euclidean space]] is a good approximation for it only over short distances (relative to the strength of the  [[gravity|gravitational field]]).<ref>Misner, Thorne, and Wheeler (1973), p.&nbsp;47</ref>\n\nEuclidean geometry is an example of [[synthetic geometry]], in that it proceeds logically from axioms describing basic properties of geometric objects such as points and lines, to propositions about those objects, all without the use of [[coordinate system|coordinates]] to specify those objects. This is in contrast to [[analytic geometry]], which uses coordinates to translate geometric propositions into algebraic formulas.\n\n==The ''Elements''==\n{{main|Euclid's Elements}}\nThe ''Elements'' is mainly a systematization of earlier knowledge of geometry. Its improvement over earlier treatments was rapidly recognized, with the result that there was little interest in preserving the earlier ones, and they are now nearly all lost.\n\nThere are 13 books in the ''Elements'':\n\nBooks I\u2013IV and VI discuss plane geometry. Many results about plane figures are proved, for example \"In any triangle two angles taken together in any manner are less than two right angles.\" (Book 1 proposition 17) and the [[Pythagorean theorem]] \"In right angled triangles the square on the side subtending the right angle is equal to the squares on the sides containing the right angle.\" (Book I, proposition 47)\n\nBooks V and VII\u2013X deal with [[number theory]], with numbers treated geometrically as lengths of line segments or areas of regions. Notions such as [[prime numbers]] and [[rational number|rational]] and [[irrational number]]s are introduced. It is proved that there are infinitely many prime numbers.\n\nBooks XI\u2013XIII concern [[solid geometry]]. A typical result is the 1:3 ratio between the volume of a cone and a cylinder with the same height and base. The [[platonic solid]]s are constructed.\n\n===Axioms===\n[[File:Parallel postulate en.svg|thumb|The parallel postulate (Postulate 5): If two lines intersect a third in such a way that the sum of the inner angles on one side is less than two right angles, then the two lines inevitably must intersect each other on that side if extended far enough.]]\n\nEuclidean geometry is an [[axiomatic system]], in which all [[theorem]]s (\"true statements\") are derived from a small number of simple axioms. Until the advent of [[non-Euclidean geometry]], these axioms were considered to be obviously true in the physical world, so that all the theorems would be equally true. However, Euclid's reasoning from assumptions to conclusions remains valid independent of their physical reality.<ref name=Wolfe>The assumptions of Euclid are discussed from a modern perspective in \n{{cite book |title=Introduction to Non-Euclidean Geometry |author=Harold E. Wolfe |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VPHn3MutWhQC&pg=PA9 |page=9 |isbn=1-4067-1852-1 |year=2007 |publisher=Mill Press}}\n</ref>\n\nNear the beginning of the first book of the ''Elements'', Euclid gives five [[postulate]]s (axioms) for plane geometry, stated in terms of constructions (as translated by Thomas Heath):<ref>tr. Heath, pp. 195\u2013202.</ref>\n\n:Let the following be postulated:\n# To draw a [[straight line]] from any [[Point (geometry)|point]] to any point.\n# To produce (extend) a [[Line segment|finite straight line]] continuously in a straight line.\n# To describe a [[circle]] with any centre and distance (radius).\n# That all [[right angle]]s are equal to one another.\n# [The [[parallel postulate]]]: That, if a straight line falling on two straight lines make the interior angles on the same side less than two right angles, the two straight lines, if produced indefinitely, meet on that side on which the angles are less than two right angles.\n\nAlthough Euclid only explicitly asserts the existence of the constructed objects, in his reasoning they are implicitly assumed to be unique.\n\nThe ''Elements'' also include the following five \"common notions\":\n\n# Things that are equal to the same thing are also equal to one another (the [[Transitive property]] of a [[Euclidean relation]]).\n# If equals are added to equals, then the wholes are equal (Addition property of equality).\n# If equals are subtracted from equals, then the differences are equal (Subtraction property of equality).\n# Things that coincide with one another are equal to one another (Reflexive property).\n# The whole is greater than the part.\n\nModern scholars agree that Euclid's postulates do not provide the complete logical foundation that Euclid required for his presentation.<ref>{{citation|first=Gerard A.|last=Venema|title=Foundations of Geometry|year=2006|publisher=Prentice-Hall|page=8|isbn=978-0-13-143700-5}}</ref> Modern [[Foundations of geometry|treatments]] use more extensive and complete sets of axioms.\n\n===Parallel postulate===\n{{main|Parallel postulate}}\nTo the ancients, the parallel postulate seemed less obvious than the others. They aspired to create a system of absolutely certain propositions, and to them it seemed as if the parallel line postulate required proof from simpler statements. It is now known that such a proof is impossible, since one can construct consistent systems of geometry (obeying the other axioms) in which the parallel postulate is true, and others in which it is false.<ref>{{Citation|title=History of the Parallel Postulate|journal=The American Mathematical Monthly|volume=27|issue=1|pages=16\u201323|date=Jan 1920|author=Florence P. Lewis|doi=10.2307/2973238|publisher=The American Mathematical Monthly, Vol. 27, No. 1|postscript=.|jstor=2973238}}</ref> Euclid himself seems to have considered it as being qualitatively different from the others, as evidenced by the organization of the ''Elements'': his first 28 propositions are those that can be proved without it.\n\nMany alternative axioms can be formulated which are [[logical equivalence|logically equivalent]] to the parallel postulate (in the context of the other axioms). For example, [[Playfair's axiom]] states:\n\n:In a [[Plane (geometry)|plane]], through a point not on a given straight line, at most one line can be drawn that never meets the given line.\n\nThe \"at most\" clause is all that is needed since it can be proved from the remaining axioms that at least one parallel line exists.\n\n[[File:euclid-proof.svg|thumb|A proof from Euclid's ''Elements'' that, given a line segment, one may construct an equilateral triangle that includes the segment as one of its sides: an equilateral triangle \u0391\u0392\u0393 is made by drawing circles \u0394 and \u0395 centered on the points \u0391 and \u0392, and taking one intersection of the circles as the third vertex of the triangle.]]\n\n==Methods of proof==\nEuclidean Geometry is ''[[Constructive proof|constructive]]''. Postulates 1, 2, 3, and 5 assert the existence and uniqueness of certain geometric figures, and these assertions are of a constructive nature: that is, we are not only told that certain things exist, but are also given methods for creating them with no more than a [[compass and straightedge|compass and an unmarked straightedge]].<ref>Ball, p.&nbsp;56</ref> In this sense, Euclidean geometry is more concrete than many modern axiomatic systems such as [[set theory]], which often assert the existence of objects without saying how to construct them, or even assert the existence of objects that cannot be constructed within the theory.<ref name=set_theory>Within Euclid's assumptions, it is quite easy to give a formula for area of triangles and squares. However, in a more general context like set theory, it is not as easy to prove that the area of a square is the sum of areas of its pieces, for example. See [[Lebesgue measure]] and [[Banach\u2013Tarski paradox]].</ref> Strictly speaking, the lines on paper are ''[[Scientific modelling|models]]'' of the objects defined within the formal system, rather than instances of those objects. For example, a Euclidean straight line has no width, but any real drawn line will. Though nearly all modern mathematicians consider [[Existence theorem|nonconstructive methods]] just as sound as constructive ones, Euclid's constructive proofs often supplanted fallacious nonconstructive ones\u2014e.g., some of the Pythagoreans' proofs that involved irrational numbers, which usually required a statement such as \"Find the greatest common measure of ...\"<ref>{{cite book|author=Daniel Shanks|title=Solved and Unsolved Problems in Number Theory|year=2002|publisher=American Mathematical Society}}</ref>\n\nEuclid often used [[proof by contradiction]]. Euclidean geometry also allows the method of superposition, in which a figure is transferred to another point in space. For example, proposition I.4, side-angle-side congruence of triangles, is proved by moving one of the two triangles so that one of its sides coincides with the other triangle's equal side, and then proving that the other sides coincide as well. Some modern treatments add a sixth postulate, the rigidity of the triangle, which can be used as an alternative to superposition.<ref>Coxeter, p.&nbsp;5</ref>\n\n==System of measurement and arithmetic==\nEuclidean geometry has two fundamental types of measurements: [[angle]] and [[Euclidean distance|distance]]. The angle scale is absolute, and Euclid uses the [[right angle]] as his basic unit, so that, for example, a 45-[[degree (angle)|degree]] angle would be referred to as half of a right angle. The distance scale is relative; one arbitrarily picks a line segment with a certain nonzero length as the unit, and other distances are expressed in relation to it. Addition of distances is represented by a construction in which one line segment is copied onto the end of another line segment to extend its length, and similarly for subtraction.\n\nMeasurements of [[area (geometry)|area]] and [[volume]] are derived from distances. For example, a [[rectangle]] with a width of 3 and a length of 4 has an area that represents the product, 12. Because this geometrical interpretation of multiplication was limited to three dimensions, there was no direct way of interpreting the product of four or more numbers, and Euclid avoided such products, although they are implied, for example in the proof of book IX, proposition 20.\n\n[[File:Congruentie.svg|thumb|An example of congruence. The two figures on the left are congruent, while the third is [[Similarity (geometry)|similar]] to them. The last figure is neither. Congruences alter some properties, such as location and orientation, but leave others unchanged, like [[distance]] and [[angle]]s. The latter sort of properties are called [[invariant (mathematics)|invariant]]s and studying them is the essence of geometry.]]\nEuclid refers to a pair of lines, or a pair of planar or solid figures, as \"equal\" (\u1f34\u03c3\u03bf\u03c2) if their lengths, areas, or volumes are equal respectively, and similarly for angles. The stronger term \"[[congruence (geometry)|congruent]]\" refers to the idea that an entire figure is the same size and shape as another figure. Alternatively, two figures are congruent if one can be moved on top of the other so that it matches up with it exactly. (Flipping it over is allowed.) Thus, for example, a 2x6 rectangle and a 3x4 rectangle are equal but not congruent, and the letter R is congruent to its mirror image. Figures that would be congruent except for their differing sizes are referred to as [[similarity (geometry)|similar]]. [[corresponding sides and corresponding angles|Corresponding angles]] in a pair of similar shapes are congruent and [[corresponding sides]] are in proportion to each other.\n\n==Notation and terminology==\n\n===Naming of points and figures===\nPoints are customarily named using capital letters of the alphabet. Other figures, such as lines, triangles, or circles, are named by listing a sufficient number of points to pick them out unambiguously from the relevant figure, e.g., triangle ABC would typically be a triangle with vertices at points A, B, and C.\n\n=== Complementary and supplementary angles ===\nAngles whose sum is a right angle are called [[Complementary angles|complementary]]. Complementary angles are formed when a ray shares the same vertex and is pointed in a direction that is in between the two original rays that form the right angle. The number of rays in between the two original rays is infinite.\n\nAngles whose sum is a straight angle are [[Supplementary angles|supplementary]]. Supplementary angles are formed when a ray shares the same vertex and is pointed in a direction that is in between the two original rays that form the straight angle (180 degree angle). The number of rays in between the two original rays is infinite.\n\n=== Modern versions of Euclid's notation ===\nIn modern terminology, angles would normally be measured in [[degree (angle)|degree]]s or [[radian]]s.\n\nModern school textbooks often define separate figures called [[line (geometry)|line]]s (infinite), [[Line (mathematics)#Ray|rays]] (semi-infinite), and [[line segment]]s (of finite length). Euclid, rather than discussing a ray as an object that extends to infinity in one direction, would normally use locutions such as \"if the line is extended to a sufficient length,\" although he occasionally referred to \"infinite lines\". A \"line\" in Euclid could be either straight or curved, and he used the more specific term \"straight line\" when necessary.\n\n== Some important or well known results ==\n<gallery perrow=\"4\">\nFile:pons_asinorum_dzmanto.png|The ''[[pons asinorum]]'' or ''bridge of asses theorem''' states that in an isosceles triangle, \u03b1&nbsp;=&nbsp;\u03b2 and \u03b3&nbsp;=&nbsp;\u03b4.\nFile:Sum_of_angles_of_triangle_dzmanto.png|The ''triangle angle sum theorem'' states that the sum of the three angles of any triangle, in this case angles \u03b1, \u03b2, and \u03b3, will always equal 180 degrees.\nFile:Pythagorean.svg|The ''[[Pythagorean theorem]]'' states that the sum of the areas of the two squares on the legs (''a'' and ''b'') of a right triangle equals the area of the square on the hypotenuse (''c'').\nFile:Thales' Theorem Simple.svg|''[[Thales' theorem]]'' states that if AC is a diameter, then the angle at B is a right angle.\n</gallery>\n\n===Pons Asinorum===\nThe [[pons asinorum]] (''bridge of asses'') states that ''in isosceles triangles the angles at the base equal one another, and, if the equal straight lines are produced further, then the angles under the base equal one another.''<ref>Euclid, book I, proposition 5, tr. Heath, p.&nbsp;251</ref> Its name may be attributed to its frequent role as the first real test in the ''Elements'' of the intelligence of the reader and as a bridge to the harder propositions that followed. It might also be so named because of the geometrical figure's resemblance to a steep bridge that only a sure-footed donkey could cross.<ref>Ignoring the alleged difficulty of Book I, Proposition 5, [[T. L. Heath|Sir Thomas L. Heath]] mentions another interpretation. This rests on the resemblance of the figure's lower straight lines to a steeply inclined bridge that could be crossed by an ass but not by a horse: \"But there is another view (as I have learnt lately) which is more complimentary to the ass. It is that, the figure of the proposition being like that of a trestle bridge, with a ramp at each end which is more practicable the flatter the figure is drawn, the bridge is such that, while a horse could not surmount the ramp, an ass could; in other words, the term is meant to refer to the sure-footedness of the ass rather than to any want of intelligence on his part.\" (in \"Excursis II,\" volume 1 of Heath's translation of ''The Thirteen Books of the Elements''.)</ref>\n\n===Congruence of triangles===\n[[File:Congruent triangles.svg|thumb|right|Congruence of triangles is determined by specifying two sides and the angle between them (SAS), two angles and the side between them (ASA) or two angles and a corresponding adjacent side (AAS). Specifying two sides and an adjacent angle (SSA), however, can yield two distinct possible triangles unless the angle specified is a right angle.]]\n\nTriangles are congruent if they have all three sides equal (SSS), two sides and the angle between them equal (SAS), or two angles and a side equal (ASA) (Book I, propositions 4, 8, and 26). Triangles with three equal angles (AAA) are similar, but not necessarily congruent. Also, triangles with two equal sides and an adjacent angle are not necessarily equal or congruent.\n\n===Triangle angle sum===\nThe sum of the angles of a triangle is equal to a straight angle (180 degrees).<ref>Euclid, book I, proposition 32</ref> This causes an equilateral triangle to have three interior angles of 60 degrees. Also, it causes every triangle to have at least two acute angles and up to one [[obtuse angle|obtuse]] or [[right angle]].\n\n===Pythagorean theorem===\nThe celebrated [[Pythagorean theorem]] (book I, proposition 47) states that in any right triangle, the area of the square whose side is the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the areas of the squares whose sides are the two legs (the two sides that meet at a right angle).\n\n===Thales' theorem===\n[[Thales' theorem]], named after [[Thales of Miletus]] states that if A, B, and C are points on a circle where the line AC is a diameter of the circle, then the angle ABC is a right angle. Cantor supposed that Thales proved his theorem by means of Euclid Book I, Prop. 32 after the manner of Euclid Book III, Prop. 31.<ref>Heath, p.&nbsp;135.

Euclid proved these results in various special cases such as the area of a circle<ref>Euclid, book XII, proposition 2</ref> and the volume of a parallelepipedal solid.<ref>Euclid, book XI, proposition 33</ref> Euclid determined some, but not all, of the relevant constants of proportionality. E.g., it was his successor [[Archimedes]] who proved that a sphere has 2/3 the volume of the circumscribing cylinder.<ref>Ball, p.&nbsp;66</ref>\n\n==Applications==\n{{Expand section|date=March 2009}}\nBecause of Euclidean geometry's fundamental status in mathematics, it is impractical to give more than a representative sampling of applications here.\n\n<gallery perrow=\"3\">\nFile:us land survey officer.jpg|A surveyor uses a [[Dumpy level|level]]\nFile:Ambersweet oranges.jpg|[[Sphere packing]] applies to a stack of [[orange (fruit)|orange]]s.\nFile:Parabola with focus and arbitrary line.svg|A parabolic mirror brings parallel rays of light to a focus.\n</gallery>\n\nAs suggested by the etymology of the word, one of the earliest reasons for interest in geometry was [[surveying]],<ref>Ball, p.&nbsp;5</ref> and certain practical results from Euclidean geometry, such as the right-angle property of the 3-4-5 triangle, were used long before they were proved formally.<ref>Eves, vol. 1, p.&nbsp;5; Mlodinow, p.&nbsp;7</ref> The fundamental types of measurements in Euclidean geometry are distances and angles, both of which can be measured directly by a surveyor.

Modern, more rigorous reformulations of the system<ref>e.g., Tarski (1951)</ref> typically aim for a cleaner separation of these issues. Interpreting Euclid's axioms in the spirit of this more modern approach, axioms 1-4 are consistent with either infinite or finite space (as in [[elliptic geometry]]), and all five axioms are consistent with a variety of topologies (e.g., a plane, a cylinder, or a [[torus]] for two-dimensional Euclidean geometry).\n\n==Later work==\n\n===Archimedes and Apollonius===\n[[File:Archimedes sphere and cylinder.svg|thumb|right|A sphere has 2/3 the volume and surface area of its circumscribing cylinder. A sphere and cylinder were placed on the tomb of Archimedes at his request.]]\n[[Archimedes]] (c. 287 BCE \u2013 c. 212 BCE), a colorful figure about whom many historical anecdotes are recorded, is remembered along with Euclid as one of the greatest of ancient mathematicians. Although the foundations of his work were put in place by Euclid, his work, unlike Euclid's, is believed to have been entirely original.<ref>Eves, p.&nbsp;27</ref> He proved equations for the volumes and areas of various figures in two and three dimensions, and enunciated the [[Archimedean property]] of finite numbers.\n\n[[Apollonius of Perga]] (c. 262 BCE \u2013 c. 190 BCE) is mainly known for his investigation of conic sections.\n\n[[File:Frans Hals - Portret van Ren\u00e9 Descartes.jpg|thumb|left|Ren\u00e9 Descartes. Portrait after [[Frans Hals]], 1648.]]\n\n===17th century: Descartes===\n[[Ren\u00e9 Descartes]] (1596\u20131650) developed [[analytic geometry]], an alternative method for formalizing geometry which focused on turning geometry into algebra.<ref>Ball, pp. 268ff</ref>\n\nIn this approach, a point on a plane is represented by its [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian]] (''x'', ''y'') coordinates, a line is represented by its equation, and so on.\n\nIn Euclid's original approach, the [[Pythagorean theorem]] follows from Euclid's axioms. In the Cartesian approach, the axioms are the axioms of algebra, and the equation expressing the Pythagorean theorem is then a definition of one of the terms in Euclid's axioms, which are now considered theorems.\n\nThe equation\n:<math>|PQ|=\\sqrt{(p_x-q_x)^2+(p_y-q_y)^2} \\, </math>\ndefining the distance between two points ''P'' = (''p<sub>x</sub>'', ''p<sub>y</sub>'') and ''Q'' = (''q<sub>x</sub>'', ''q<sub>y</sub>'') is then known as the ''Euclidean [[metric space|metric]]'', and other metrics define [[non-Euclidean geometry|non-Euclidean geometries]].\n\nIn terms of analytic geometry, the restriction of classical geometry to compass and straightedge constructions means a restriction to first- and second-order equations, e.g., ''y'' = 2''x'' + 1 (a line), or ''x''<sup>2</sup> + ''y''<sup>2</sup> = 7 (a circle).\n\nAlso in the 17th century, [[Girard Desargues]], motivated by the theory of [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]], introduced the concept of idealized points, lines, and planes at infinity. The result can be considered as a type of generalized geometry, [[projective geometry]], but it can also be used to produce proofs in ordinary Euclidean geometry in which the number of special cases is reduced.<ref>Eves (1963)</ref>\n\n[[File:Squaring the circle.svg|right|thumb|Squaring the circle: the areas of this square and this circle are equal. In 1882, it was proven that this figure cannot be constructed in a finite number of steps with an idealized [[compass and straightedge]].]]\n\n===18th century===\nGeometers of the 18th century struggled to define the boundaries of the Euclidean system. Many tried in vain to prove the fifth postulate from the first four. By 1763, at least 28 different proofs had been published, but all were found incorrect.<ref>Hofstadter 1979, p.&nbsp;91.</ref>\n\nLeading up to this period, geometers also tried to determine what constructions could be accomplished in Euclidean geometry. For example, the problem of [[trisecting an angle]] with a compass and straightedge is one that naturally occurs within the theory, since the axioms refer to constructive operations that can be carried out with those tools. However, centuries of efforts failed to find a solution to this problem, until [[Pierre Wantzel]] published a proof in 1837 that such a construction was impossible. Other constructions that were proved impossible include [[doubling the cube]] and [[squaring the circle]]. In the case of doubling the cube, the impossibility of the construction originates from the fact that the compass and straightedge method involve equations whose order is an integral power of two,<ref>Theorem 120, Elements of Abstract Algebra, Allan Clark, Dover, {{ISBN|0-486-64725-0}}</ref> while doubling a cube requires the solution of a third-order equation.\n\n[[Leonhard Euler|Euler]] discussed a generalization of Euclidean geometry called [[affine geometry]], which retains the fifth postulate unmodified while weakening postulates three and four in a way that eliminates the notions of angle (whence right triangles become meaningless) and of equality of length of line segments in general (whence circles become meaningless) while retaining the notions of parallelism as an equivalence relation between lines, and equality of length of parallel line segments (so line segments continue to have a midpoint).\n\n===19th century and non-Euclidean geometry===\nIn the early 19th century, [[Lazare Carnot|Carnot]] and [[August Ferdinand M\u00f6bius|M\u00f6bius]] systematically developed the use of signed angles and line segments as a way of simplifying and unifying results.<ref>Eves (1963), p.&nbsp;64</ref>\n\nThe century's most significant development in geometry occurred when, around 1830, [[J\u00e1nos Bolyai]] and [[Nikolai Ivanovich Lobachevsky]] separately published work on [[non-Euclidean geometry]], in which the parallel postulate is not valid.<ref>Ball, p.&nbsp;485</ref> Since non-Euclidean geometry is provably relatively consistent with Euclidean geometry, the parallel postulate cannot be proved from the other postulates.\n\nIn the 19th century, it was also realized that Euclid's ten axioms and common notions do not suffice to prove all of the theorems stated in the ''Elements''. For example, Euclid assumed implicitly that any line contains at least two points, but this assumption cannot be proved from the other axioms, and therefore must be an axiom itself. The very first geometric proof in the ''Elements,'' shown in the figure above, is that any line segment is part of a triangle; Euclid constructs this in the usual way, by drawing circles around both endpoints and taking their intersection as the third [[wikt:vertex|vertex]]. His axioms, however, do not guarantee that the circles actually intersect, because they do not assert the geometrical property of continuity, which in Cartesian terms is equivalent to the [[Real number#Completeness|completeness]] property of the real numbers. Starting with [[Moritz Pasch]] in 1882, many improved axiomatic systems for geometry have been proposed, the best known being those of [[Hilbert's axioms|Hilbert]],<ref>* [[Howard Eves]], 1997 (1958).

In a 1919 test of the general theory of relativity, stars (marked with short horizontal lines) were photographed during a solar [[eclipse]]. The rays of starlight were bent by the Sun's gravity on their way to the earth. This is interpreted as evidence in favor of Einstein's prediction that gravity would cause deviations from Euclidean geometry.]]\n[[Albert Einstein|Einstein's]] theory of [[special relativity]] involves a four-dimensional [[space-time]], the [[Minkowski space]], which is [[non-Euclidean geometry|non-Euclidean]]. This shows that non-Euclidean geometries, which were introduced a few years earlier for showing that the [[parallel postulate]] cannot be proved, are also useful for describing the physical world.\n\nHowever, the three-dimensional \"space part\" of the Minkowski space remains the space of Euclidean geometry. This is not the case with [[general relativity]], for which the geometry of the space part of space-time is not Euclidean geometry.<ref>Misner, Thorne, and Wheeler (1973), p.&nbsp;191</ref> For example, if a triangle is constructed out of three rays of light, then in general the interior angles do not add up to 180 degrees due to gravity. A relatively weak gravitational field, such as the Earth's or the sun's, is represented by a metric that is approximately, but not exactly, Euclidean. Until the 20th century, there was no technology capable of detecting the deviations from Euclidean geometry, but Einstein predicted that such deviations would exist. They were later verified by observations such as the slight bending of starlight by the Sun during a solar eclipse in 1919, and such considerations are now an integral part of the software that runs the [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] system.<ref>Rizos, Chris.

However, he typically did not make such distinctions unless they were necessary. The postulates do not explicitly refer to infinite lines, although for example some commentators interpret postulate 3, existence of a circle with any radius, as implying that space is infinite.<ref name=\"Heath, p.&nbsp;200\"/>\n\nThe notion of [[infinitesimals|infinitesimal quantities]] had previously been discussed extensively by the [[Eleatic School]], but nobody had been able to put them on a firm logical basis, with paradoxes such as [[Zeno's paradox]] occurring that had not been resolved to universal satisfaction. Euclid used the [[method of exhaustion]] rather than infinitesimals.<ref>Ball, p.&nbsp;31</ref>\n\nLater ancient commentators, such as [[Proclus]] (410\u2013485 CE), treated many questions about infinity as issues demanding proof and, e.g., Proclus claimed to prove the infinite divisibility of a line, based on a proof by contradiction in which he considered the cases of even and odd numbers of points constituting it.<ref>Heath, p.&nbsp;268</ref>\n\nAt the turn of the 20th century, [[Otto Stolz]], [[Paul du Bois-Reymond]], [[Giuseppe Veronese]], and others produced controversial work on [[Archimedean property|non-Archimedean]] models of Euclidean geometry, in which the distance between two points may be infinite or infinitesimal, in the [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]\u2013[[Gottfried Leibniz|Leibniz]] sense.<ref>Giuseppe Veronese, On Non-Archimedean Geometry, 1908.

Non-standard analysis.</ref>\n\n===Infinite processes===\nOne reason that the ancients treated the parallel postulate as less certain than the others is that verifying it physically would require us to inspect two lines to check that they never intersected, even at some very distant point, and this inspection could potentially take an infinite amount of time.<ref>For the assertion that this was the historical reason for the ancients considering the parallel postulate less obvious than the others, see Nagel and Newman 1958, p.&nbsp;9.</ref>\n\nThe modern formulation of [[proof by induction]] was not developed until the 17th century, but some later commentators consider it implicit in some of Euclid's proofs, e.g., the proof of the infinitude of primes.<ref>Cajori (1918), p.&nbsp;197</ref>\n\nSupposed paradoxes involving infinite series, such as [[Zeno's paradox]], predated Euclid.

Many assumed she was a witch and miser, who guarded a fortune, but who, nonetheless never missed mass (travelling long distances between mountains and valleys while huddling on the side-roads under her cape) and regularly panhandled in the streets. One day, after a long absence, the local villagers went to her humble cabana, where they discovered the body of the old woman within her cape and with a letter to the King. Presented with the letter and her cape, the King was surprised by the old woman's request to have him build a Church for the local people of her village. The King immediately ordered the cape destroyed, but was astonished to see gold coins falling from the cape. With the money he fulfilled the old woman's request from the rich bounty of her cape. From there the name ''Capa-Rica'' developed, for ''capa'' (''cape'') and ''rica'' (''rich''), which became associated with the region.<ref name=JFHistoria/>\n\nLegend suggests that, in 1800, the Costa da Caparica was the site for the ''Casa da Coroa'' (the first house of rock and limestone) which received its importance for a little-known fact.<ref name=JFHistoria/>  It was believed that King [[John VI of Portugal]] in 1824 had eaten a delicious seafood stew, and for that reason, he ordered that the royal coat-of-arms be raised on the local fountain. Similarly, the site was the supposed way-point on journeys involving Queen Maria II of Portugal and King Pedro V of Portugal and his Royal Consort, who travelled through the Costa de Caparica on unrelated trips.<ref name=JFHistoria/>\n\nThe territory was part of the parish of Caprica until 1926, before becoming an enclave [[Trafaria]] until 1949.<ref name=JFHistoria/>  The urban agglomeration was classified as a town on 9 July 1985, and elevated to the status of city on 9 December 2004.<ref name=JFHistoria/>\n\nIt was the only [[freguesia]] in [[Almada Municipality|Almada]] which has not suffered any changes with the administrative reform of 2013.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:2010-03-07 14 02 24 Portugal-Costa de Caparica.jpg|thumb|left|The coast near the mouth of the Tagus River]]\n[[File:Vista da Costa de Caparica.jpg|thumb|left|Condominiums and residences in the built-up portion of the parish]]\n[[File:Seine fishing in Portugal, at Praia da Sa\u00fade beach, Costa da Caparica (2).jpg|thumb|left|Seine fishing using two tractors and one fishing vessel (sunset 21:18) Praia da Sa\u00fade (in English, Beach of Health) Costa da Caparica, next to Almada at 15 kilometers of the Lisbon city in Portugal.]]\n\n===Physical geography===\nSituated on the occidental coast of the Peninsula of Set\u00fabal, the territory is the result of ocean receding, covering an area of 10.18&nbsp;km\u00b2 between the water and main escarpment. The space is one large beach resulting from progressive decline from the east to the sea. Its coastal extent represents the largest contiguous beach in Portugal, with an expanse of approximately 30 kilometres, from the left margin of the [[Tagus River]] to the estuary of Albufeira.<ref name=JFHistoria/>  Popular in the summer with tourists and local visitors, the beaches have suffered from erosion in recent years; several levels of Portuguese government have taken steps to reduce these patterns, but the erosion has continued at several of the beaches located closest to the mouth of the Tagus.<ref name=JFHistoria/>\n\n===Ecoregions/Protected areas===\nPortugal is bisected by geological and geomorphological landscapes of important interest, both for its scientific and natural appeal, such as the ''[[Costa da Caparica Fossil Cliff Protected Landscape]]'' ({{lang-pt|Paisagem Protegida da Arriba F\u00f3ssil da Costa da Caparica}}), a prehistoric beach landscape near Terras da Costa, that consist of intricately carved cliffs and erosional deposits, intersected by ravines and clifftops covered in vegetation.<ref name=JFHistoria/> Its relative proximity to urban development and sprawl, coupled with progressive deterioration resulted in the 22 May 1984 decree-law 168/84 that constituted the ''Paisagem Protegida'' with the hope of preserving the geomorphological characteristics and the natural communities that existed within the territory, promoting a balance between the biology and landscape.<ref name=JFHistoria/>  On 24 November 2008, in a Council of Ministers resolution (178/2008) provided a mechanism for safeguarding the resources and natural value, establishing a specific use and management strategy for the area.<ref name=JFHistoria/>\n\nAlthough the ''Arriba F\u00f3ssil'' is the dominant scenic element of the protected area (PPAFCC), within its limits is the Reserva Bot\u00e2nica da Mata Nacional dos Medos (Botanical Reserve of the National Game Preserve of Medos), also referred to as ''Pinhal do Rei'' (the ''King's Pineforest''), on which King [[John V of Portugal]] ordered the seeding of lands to reduce dune encroachment and deforestation. Also under the management of the PPAFCC, is the ''Mata das Dunas da Costa da Caparica e Trafaria'' (''Dunes Game Preserve of Costa da Caprica and Trafaria''), at the base of the beach; a 600 hectare area of forest, the ''Mata das Dunas'' is a natural forest still maintained.<ref name=JFHistoria/>\n\n====Camping====\nThe main parks and camping sites in the parish include:\n* Parque de Campismo Orbitur\n* Parque de Campismo da Costa Nova (Clube de Campismo de Lisboa)\n* Parque de Campismo INATEL Caparica\n* Praia da Sa\u00fade\n* Praia da Mata\n\n====Recreation====\n\nThe Almada Municipality on 26 June 2015 proclaimed [[Praia da Adi\u00e7a]] (<small>{{coord|38.554343| -9.188697|display=inline|format=dms}}</small>) a [[naturist]] beach.<ref name=\"osna_Port\">{{Cite web| title = Portugal has more naturist Beach\u00bb Naturists| author =| work = The Naturists| date = 17 July 2015| accessdate = 2015-07-18| url = http://osnaturistas.com/en/noticias/portugal-tem-mais-uma-praia-naturista/| quote =}}</ref>\n\n===Human geography===\n[[File:Caparica December 2011-8.jpg|thumb|The beach of Costa da Caparica]]\nAlthough designated a city, and its public administration vested in the civil parish of Costa da Caparica, the area consists of several integrated communities and localities, including S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o, Santo Ant\u00f3nio, Terras da Costa and Fonte da Telha.

Many assumed she was a witch and miser, who guarded a fortune, but who, nonetheless never missed mass (travelling long distances between mountains and valleys while huddling on the side-roads under her cape) and regularly panhandled in the streets. One day, after a long absence, the local villagers went to her humble cabana, where they discovered the body of the old woman within her cape and with a letter to the King. Presented with the letter and her cape, the King was surprised by the old woman's request to have him build a Church for the local people of her village. The King immediately ordered the cape destroyed, but was astonished to see gold coins falling from the cape. With the money he fulfilled the old woman's request from the rich bounty of her cape. From there the name ''Capa-Rica'' developed, for ''capa'' (''cape'') and ''rica'' (''rich''), which became associated with the region.<ref name=JFHistoria/>\n\nLegend suggests that, in 1800, the Costa da Caparica was the site for the ''Casa da Coroa'' (the first house of rock and limestone) which received its importance for a little-known fact.<ref name=JFHistoria/>  It was believed that King [[John VI of Portugal]] in 1824 had eaten a delicious seafood stew, and for that reason, he ordered that the royal coat-of-arms be raised on the local fountain. Similarly, the site was the supposed way-point on journeys involving Queen Maria II of Portugal and King Pedro V of Portugal and his Royal Consort, who travelled through the Costa de Caparica on unrelated trips.<ref name=JFHistoria/>\n\nThe territory was part of the parish of Caprica until 1926, before becoming an enclave [[Trafaria]] until 1949.<ref name=JFHistoria/>  The urban agglomeration was classified as a town on 9 July 1985, and elevated to the status of city on 9 December 2004.<ref name=JFHistoria/>\n\nIt was the only [[freguesia]] in [[Almada Municipality|Almada]] which has not suffered any changes with the administrative reform of 2013.\n\n==Geography==\n[[File:2010-03-07 14 02 24 Portugal-Costa de Caparica.jpg|thumb|left|The coast near the mouth of the Tagus River]]\n[[File:Vista da Costa de Caparica.jpg|thumb|left|Condominiums and residences in the built-up portion of the parish]]\n[[File:Seine fishing in Portugal, at Praia da Sa\u00fade beach, Costa da Caparica (2).jpg|thumb|left|Seine fishing using two tractors and one fishing vessel (sunset 21:18) Praia da Sa\u00fade (in English, Beach of Health) Costa da Caparica, next to Almada at 15 kilometers of the Lisbon city in Portugal.]]\n\n===Physical geography===\nSituated on the occidental coast of the Peninsula of Set\u00fabal, the territory is the result of ocean receding, covering an area of 10.18&nbsp;km\u00b2 between the water and main escarpment.

Also under the management of the PPAFCC, is the ''Mata das Dunas da Costa da Caparica e Trafaria'' (''Dunes Game Preserve of Costa da Caprica and Trafaria''), at the base of the beach; a 600 hectare area of forest, the ''Mata das Dunas'' is a natural forest still maintained.<ref name=JFHistoria/>\n\n====Camping====\nThe main parks and camping sites in the parish include:\n* Parque de Campismo Orbitur\n* Parque de Campismo da Costa Nova (Clube de Campismo de Lisboa)\n* Parque de Campismo INATEL Caparica\n* Praia da Sa\u00fade\n* Praia da Mata\n\n====Recreation====\n\nThe Almada Municipality on 26 June 2015 proclaimed [[Praia da Adi\u00e7a]] (<small>{{coord|38.554343| -9.188697|display=inline|format=dms}}</small>) a [[naturist]] beach.<ref name=\"osna_Port\">{{Cite web| title = Portugal has more naturist Beach\u00bb Naturists| author =| work = The Naturists| date = 17 July 2015| accessdate = 2015-07-18| url = http://osnaturistas.com/en/noticias/portugal-tem-mais-uma-praia-naturista/| quote =}}</ref>\n\n===Human geography===\n[[File:Caparica December 2011-8.jpg|thumb|The beach of Costa da Caparica]]\nAlthough designated a city, and its public administration vested in the civil parish of Costa da Caparica, the area consists of several integrated communities and localities, including S\u00e3o Jo\u00e3o, Santo Ant\u00f3nio, Terras da Costa and Fonte da Telha.

Some of the most notable recommendations of the Kalelkar commission were:\n#Undertaking caste-wise enumeration of population in the census of 1961;\n#Relating social backwardness of a class to its low position in the traditional caste hierarchy of Indian society;\n#Treating all women as a class as \"backward\";\n#Reservation of 70 per cent seats in all technical and professional institutions for qualified students of backward classes.\n#Reservation of vacancies in all government services and local bodies for other backward classes.\n\nThe commission in its final report recommended \"caste as the criteria\" to determine backwardness. However, the report was not accepted by the government, which feared that the backward classes excluded from the caste and communities selected by the commission might not be considered, and those in most need would be swamped by the multitudes, thus receiving insufficient attention.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n\n===Mandal Commission===\n{{main|Mandal Commission}}\n\n[[File:PopulationEstimations.jpg|thumb|600px|right|**NFHS Survey estimated only Hindu OBC population.

States which have already introduced reservation for OBC exceeding 27 per cent will not be affected by this recommendation. With this general recommendation the commission proposed the following overall scheme of reservation for OBC:\n\n# Candidates belonging to OBC recruited on the basis of merit in an open competition should not be adjusted against their reservation quota of 27 per cent.\n# The above reservation should also be made applicable to promotion quota at all levels.\n# Reserved quota remaining unfilled should be carried forward for a period of three years and de-reserved thereafter.\n# Relaxation in the upper age limit for direct recruitment should be extended to the candidates of OBC in the same manner as done in the case of [[scheduled castes and scheduled tribes]].\n# A roster system for each category of posts should be adopted by the concerned authorities in the same manner as presently done in respect of scheduled caste and scheduled tribe candidates.\n\nThese recommendations in total are applicable to all recruitment to public sector undertakings, both under the central and state governments as well as to nationalised banks. All private sector undertakings which have received financial assistance from the government in one form or other should also be obliged to recruit personnel on the aforesaid basis. All universities and affiliated colleges should also be covered by the above scheme of reservation. Although education is considered an important factor to bring a desired social change, \"educational reform\" was not within the terms of reference of this commission. To promote literacy the following measures were suggested:\n\n# An intensive time-bound programme for adult education should be launched in selected pockets with high concentration of OBC population.\n# Residential schools should be set up in these areas for backward class students to provide a climate specially conducive to serious studies. All facilities in these schools including board and lodging should be provided free of cost to attract students from poor and backward class homes.\n# Separate hostels for OBC students with above facilities will have to be provided.\n# Vocational training was considered imperative.\n# It was recommended that seats should be reserved for OBC students in all scientific, technical and professional institutions run by the central as well as state governments. The quantum of reservation should be the same as in the government services, i.e. 27 per cent.{{citation needed|date=October 2010}}\n\n===Sub-categorisation of OBCs===\nIn October 2017, President of India [[Ram Nath Kovind]] notified a five-member Commission headed by [[Delhi High Court]]'s former Chief Justice [[G.

Therefore, principally, the \"Creamy layer\" principle cannot be applied to STs and SCs, as SCs and STs are separate classes by themselves.\n# Preferably there should be a review after ten years to take note of the change of circumstances.\n# A graduation (not technical graduation) or professional course deemed to be educationally forward.\n# Principle of exclusion of [[Creamy layer]] applicable to OBC's.\n# The Central Government shall examine as to the desirability of fixing a cut off marks in respect of the candidates belonging to the Other Backward Classes (OBCs) to balance reservation with other societal interests and to maintain standards of excellence. This would ensure quality and merit would not suffer. If any seats remain vacant after adopting such norms they shall be filled up by candidates from general categories.\n# So far as determination of backward classes is concerned, a Notification should be issued by the Union of India. This can be done only after exclusion of the creamy layer for which necessary data must be obtained by the Central Government from the State Governments and Union Territories.

Some of the most notable recommendations of the Kalelkar commission were:\n#Undertaking caste-wise enumeration of population in the census of 1961;\n#Relating social backwardness of a class to its low position in the traditional caste hierarchy of Indian society;\n#Treating all women as a class as \"backward\";\n#Reservation of 70 per cent seats in all technical and professional institutions for qualified students of backward classes.\n#Reservation of vacancies in all government services and local bodies for other backward classes.\n\nThe commission in its final report recommended \"caste as the criteria\" to determine backwardness. However, the report was not accepted by the government, which feared that the backward classes excluded from the caste and communities selected by the commission might not be considered, and those in most need would be swamped by the multitudes, thus receiving insufficient attention.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}}\n\n===Mandal Commission===\n{{main|Mandal Commission}}\n\n[[File:PopulationEstimations.jpg|thumb|600px|right|**NFHS Survey estimated only Hindu OBC population.

States which have already introduced reservation for OBC exceeding 27 per cent will not be affected by this recommendation. With this general recommendation the commission proposed the following overall scheme of reservation for OBC:\n\n# Candidates belonging to OBC recruited on the basis of merit in an open competition should not be adjusted against their reservation quota of 27 per cent.\n# The above reservation should also be made applicable to promotion quota at all levels.\n# Reserved quota remaining unfilled should be carried forward for a period of three years and de-reserved thereafter.\n# Relaxation in the upper age limit for direct recruitment should be extended to the candidates of OBC in the same manner as done in the case of [[scheduled castes and scheduled tribes]].\n# A roster system for each category of posts should be adopted by the concerned authorities in the same manner as presently done in respect of scheduled caste and scheduled tribe candidates.\n\nThese recommendations in total are applicable to all recruitment to public sector undertakings, both under the central and state governments as well as to nationalised banks. All private sector undertakings which have received financial assistance from the government in one form or other should also be obliged to recruit personnel on the aforesaid basis. All universities and affiliated colleges should also be covered by the above scheme of reservation. Although education is considered an important factor to bring a desired social change, \"educational reform\" was not within the terms of reference of this commission. To promote literacy the following measures were suggested:\n\n# An intensive time-bound programme for adult education should be launched in selected pockets with high concentration of OBC population.\n# Residential schools should be set up in these areas for backward class students to provide a climate specially conducive to serious studies. All facilities in these schools including board and lodging should be provided free of cost to attract students from poor and backward class homes.\n# Separate hostels for OBC students with above facilities will have to be provided.\n# Vocational training was considered imperative.\n# It was recommended that seats should be reserved for OBC students in all scientific, technical and professional institutions run by the central as well as state governments.

The verdict produced mixed reactions from supporting and opposing quarters.\n\nSeveral criteria to identify the portion of the population comprising the \"creamy layer\" have been recommended, including the following:<ref name=telegraphcutoff>{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1080411/jsp/frontpage/story_9123781.jsp|title=New Cutoff for OBCs|date=11 April 2008|accessdate=2008-04-11|work=The Telegraph|location=Calcutta, India}}</ref>\n\n* Children of those with family income above {{INR}} 250,000 a year, and then {{INR}} 450,000 a year {{as of|lc=yes|2008|October}} and now {{INR}} 800,000 a year, should be considered creamy layer, and excluded from the reservation quota.\n* Children of doctors, engineers, chartered accountants, actors, consultants, media professionals, writers, bureaucrats, defence officers of colonel and equivalent rank or higher, high court and Supreme Court judges, and all central and state government Class A and B officials should be excluded.\n* The Court has requested Parliament to exclude the children of MPs and MLAs as well.\n\n===Supreme Court conclusions from Ashoka Kumar Thakur vs. Union of India===\n# The Constitution (Ninety-Third Amendment) Act, 2006 does not violate the \"basic structure\" of the Constitution so far as it relates to the state maintained institutions and aided educational institutions. Question whether the Constitution (Ninety-Third Amendment) Act, 2006 would be constitutionally valid or not so far as \"private unaided\" educational institutions are concerned, is left open to be decided in an appropriate case.\n# The \"[[Creamy layer]]\" principle is one of the parameters to identify backward classes. Therefore, principally, the \"Creamy layer\" principle cannot be applied to STs and SCs, as SCs and STs are separate classes by themselves.\n# Preferably there should be a review after ten years to take note of the change of circumstances.\n# A graduation (not technical graduation) or professional course deemed to be educationally forward.\n# Principle of exclusion of [[Creamy layer]] applicable to OBC's.\n# The Central Government shall examine as to the desirability of fixing a cut off marks in respect of the candidates belonging to the Other Backward Classes (OBCs) to balance reservation with other societal interests and to maintain standards of excellence. This would ensure quality and merit would not suffer. If any seats remain vacant after adopting such norms they shall be filled up by candidates from general categories.\n# So far as determination of backward classes is concerned, a Notification should be issued by the Union of India. This can be done only after exclusion of the creamy layer for which necessary data must be obtained by the Central Government from the State Governments and Union Territories. Such Notification is open to challenge on the ground of wrongful exclusion or inclusion. Norms must be fixed keeping in view the peculiar features in different States and Union Territories. There has to be proper identification of Other Backward Classes (OBCs). For identifying backward classes, the Commission set up pursuant to the directions of this Court in Indra Sawhney 1 has to work more effectively and not merely decide applications for inclusion or exclusion of castes.\n# The Parliament should fix a deadline by which time free and compulsory education will have reached every child. This must be done within six months, as the right to free and compulsory education is perhaps the most important of all the fundamental rights (Art.21 A). For without education, it becomes extremely difficult to exercise other fundamental rights.\n# If material is shown to the Central Government that the Institution deserves to be included in the Schedule (institutes which are excluded from reservations) of The Central Educational Institutions (Reservation in Admission) Act, 2006 (No. 5 of 2007), the Central Government must take an appropriate decision on the basis of materials placed and on examining the concerned issues as to whether Institution deserves to be included in the Schedule of the said act as provided in Sec 4 of the said act.\n# Held that the determination of SEBCs is done not solely based on caste and hence, the identification of SEBCs does not violate Article 15(1) of the Constitution.\n\n===Supreme Court scrapped Jat Reservations in Central OBCs list===\nIn March 2015, Supreme Court of India scrapped Jat Reservations saying that [[Jat people|Jats]] are not socially and economically backward in reference with [[National Commission for Backward Classes]]' (NCBC) opinion.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://scroll.in/article/714288/the-one-paragraph-from-the-supreme-courts-jat-quota-judgment-that-slams-competitive-backwardness|title=The one paragraph from the Supreme Court's Jat quota judgment that slams competitive backwardness|first=Rohan|last=Venkataramakrishnan|website=Scroll.in|accessdate=4 March 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://scroll.in/article/723177/why-is-the-media-outraging-against-obc-reservations-when-its-the-higher-castes-who-have-cornered-jobs|title=Why is the media outraging against OBC reservations when it's the higher castes who have cornered jobs?|first=Indrajit|last=Roy|website=Scroll.in|accessdate=4 March 2019}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://scroll.in/article/714430/the-daily-fix-supreme-court-reminds-india-that-the-third-word-in-obc-is-class-not-caste|title=The Daily Fix: Supreme Court reminds India that the third word in OBC is 'class' not 'caste'|first=Rohan|last=Venkataramakrishnan|website=Scroll.in|accessdate=4 March 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/jats-put-in-obc-as-per-constitutional-mandate-centre-to-sc/|title=Jats put in OBC as per Constitutional mandate: Centre to SC|date=5 April 2015}}</ref> Supreme Court judgement quashed the proposed inclusion of Jats in Central list of OBCs on the basis that Jats are already given OBC status in 9 States.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/verdict-on-scrapping-quota-for-jats/article7061406.ece|title=Centre moves Supreme Court seeking review of Jat quota verdict|first=Legal|last=Correspondent|date=2 April 2015|accessdate=4 March 2019|via=www.thehindu.com}}</ref> On 21 July 2015, Supreme Court rejected Centre's review plea for its verdict of quashing Jat reservation in OBCs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/OBC-status-for-Jats-SC-quashes-Centres-review-plea/articleshow/48160573.cms|title=OBC status for Jats: SC quashes Centre's review plea - Times of India|website=The Times of India|accessdate=4 March 2019}}</ref>\n\n==OBC Christians==\nThe [[Karnataka]] State Government has issued notification granting OBC reservation benefits to Brahmin Christian, Kuruba Christian, Madiga Christian, Akkasali Christian, Sudri Christian, Scheduled Caste converted to Christianity, Setty Balija Christian, Nekara Christian, Paravar Christian and Lambani Christian.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newindianexpress.com/states/karnataka/Caste-Census-to-Focus-on-Education-Economy/2015/01/06/article2605859.ece|title=Caste Census to Focus on Education, Economy}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Kerala]] government grants OBC reservation benefits to Latin Catholics, Anglo Indians and Nadar Christians included in South India United Church (SIUC).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.keralapsc.gov.in/index.php?option=com_content&id=338&Itemid=198|title=List of SCs - STs - OBCs &#124;
