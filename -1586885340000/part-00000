Dust invites his party members, Yunyun, the loli succubus, Vanir and Chris to the trip. After Dust's plans of using a magic item to make the girls fall for him failed and a squabble with the local Axis cultists, they all return from the trip only to find that everyone in Axel is suffering from the similar but more severe symptom that Keith and Taylor had. Deducing that something in the dungeon caused it, Dust and his party together with Yunyun and the loli succubus returned to the dungeon to solve the mystery.\n | Title           = Beyond the Distant

The [[4th Canadian (Armoured) Division]] attacked the German-held town of [[Friesoythe]] and one of its [[battalion]]s, [[Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada (Princess Louise's)|The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada]], captured it.\n\nDuring the fighting the battalion's commander was killed by a German soldier, but it was incorrectly rumoured that he had been killed by a civilian. Under this mistaken belief, the division's commander, [[Major General|Major-General]] [[Christopher Vokes]], ordered that the town be razed in [[Reprisal|retaliation]] and it was substantially destroyed. Twenty German civilians died in Friesoythe and the surrounding area during the two days of fighting and its aftermath. Similar, if usually less extreme, events occurred elsewhere in Germany as the Allies advanced in the closing weeks of the war.\n\nThe rubble of the town was used to fill craters in local roads to make them passable for the division's tanks and heavy vehicles. A few days earlier, the division had destroyed the centre of [[S\u00f6gel]] in another reprisal and also used the rubble to make the roads passable. Little official notice was taken of the incident and the [[Official History of the Canadian Army in the Second World War|Canadian Army official history]] glosses over it. It is covered in the regimental histories of the units involved and several accounts of the campaign. Forty years later, Vokes wrote in his autobiography that he had \"no great remorse over the elimination of Friesoythe\".\n\n==Context==\n===Allied tactics===\nBy September 1944, the [[Allies of World War II|Western Allies]] had reached [[Nazi Germany|Germany's]] western border,{{sfn|Ambrose|1997|p=117}} and by the end of October had [[Battle of Aachen|captured Aachen]], the first major German city to fall to them.{{sfn|Hastings|2004|pp=106\u2013107}} Over the following six months they overran much of western Germany. In November the [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force]] (SHAEF) publicly stated that the forces of the Western Allies would strictly adhere to international law in respect of their treatment of civilians.{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|p=256}} However, SHAEF's manual ''Combating the Guerrilla'' stated that there were circumstances where commanders could take \"stern measures\" against civilians as a [[reprisal|rapid response]] to guerrilla attacks, although this was in breach of the [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907|Hague Conventions]].{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|p=256}}\n\nThe frequency and nature of retaliatory actions differed between national contingents within the Western Allied forces.{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|p=257}} Following SHAEF's policy, [[United States Army]] forces destroyed German buildings on several occasions, sometimes entire villages, and took other measures against German civilians. French troops took a similar, if more rigorous, approach to that of the Americans.{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|pp=258\u2013259}} The British commanders disapproved of retaliations against civilians, and British troops carried out few reprisals.{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|p=257}}\n\nThe [[First Canadian Army]] served in the predominately British [[21st Army Group]], and more frequently retaliated against German civilians than the British.{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|p=257}} The commander of [[4th Canadian Division|4th&nbsp;Canadian (Armoured) Division]], Major-General [[Christopher Vokes]], believed that destroying property{{discuss}}<!--meaning buildings?  there are many kinds of property--> was the most appropriate way of responding to resistance by German civilians. The division carried out actions against German property more often than any other Canadian formation.{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|pp=258\u2013259}}\n\n[[Red Army|Soviet forces]] conducted retaliatory actions much more frequently than their Western Allies. The [[Soviet Union]]'s leadership was concerned about the threat of a [[Werwolf|Nazi resistance movement]], and Soviet forces killed, raped and imprisoned large numbers of local civilians and destroyed property following guerrilla attacks.{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|pp=268\u2013270}}\n\n===Allied attitudes===\n\nThe attitude towards the Germans throughout the Allied ranks was harsh. There was frustration at their continued resistance in a clearly hopeless cause, anger at the casualties they inflicted when the war was widely, and correctly, perceived to be almost over, and a general feeling that severe, even ruthless, treatment of German soldiers and civilians was justified.{{sfn|Atkinson|2015|p=597}} On 15&nbsp;April the British reached [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp]], where the inmates had been reduced to cannibalism.{{sfn|Atkinson|2015|p=599}} The historian [[Rick Atkinson]] wrote that \"the revelations of April&nbsp;... sparked enduring outrage\".{{sfn|Atkinson|2015|p=604}}\n\nThis was the case at all levels. An American officer wrote \"The attitude of higher command seemed to be that these people&nbsp;... should be made to feel the full significance of war and what their troops had done to other people.\"{{sfn|Hastings|2004|pp=493\u2013494}} The US general [[George Patton]] wrote in his diary \"In hundreds of villages&nbsp;... most of the houses are heaps of stone&nbsp;... I did most of it.\" When a [[sniper]] fired at one of his officers, he ordered several German houses to be burnt.{{sfn|Atkinson|2015|p=568}} When the commander of US [[3rd Armored Division (United States)|3rd Armored Division]] was killed in action {{convert|150|mi|km|disp=flip}} inside Germany on 30&nbsp;March, several villages were razed by his irate troops, captured wounded Germans were shot on the spot and at least 45&nbsp;Germans were executed after surrendering.{{sfn|Atkinson|2015|pp=581\u2013582}} An artillery officer wrote home in April \"we should fire about a thousand rounds into every [German] town. Do them good\".{{sfn|Atkinson|2015|p=598}} At least one British battalion refused to take [[Waffen-SS]] prisoners, shooting those who surrendered; an officer of the battalion blamed this on SS \"truculence\".{{sfn|Hastings|2004|p=499}} A British battalion commander summed up the risk-averse attitude within his unit: \"At this stage of the war, no one was very keen to earn medals.\"{{sfn|Hastings|2004|p=492}} A British pilot wrote: \"It seemed a stupid time to die.\"{{sfn|Hastings|2004|p=492}} A British [[corporal]] spoke for many when he wrote \"Why don't the silly bastards give up?\"{{sfn|Atkinson|2015|p=597}} Some divisions had suffered their last fatality by mid-April.{{sfn|Hastings|2004|p=500}} The historian [[Max Hastings]] wrote \"The final Anglo-American drive across Germany offered ... many foolish little battles which wasted men's lives\".{{sfn|Hastings|2004|p=491}}\n\n===Battle for S\u00f6gel===\n[[File:Moncel and Vokes.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|right|alt=Major-General Christopher Vokes in discussion with Brigadier Robert Moncel standing in a street in S\u00f6gel on 10&nbsp;April 1945|{{center|Major-General [[Christopher Vokes]] (right) with Brigadier [[Robert Moncel]] at S\u00f6gel on 10 April 1945.}}]]\nIn early April 1945 the 4th&nbsp;Canadian (Armoured) Division, as part of [[II&nbsp;Canadian Corps]], moved out of the eastern Netherlands in the wake of the Allied crossing of the [[Rhine]] in [[Operation Plunder]]. On 4&nbsp;April, [[Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada (Princess Louise's)|The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada]], part of the [[10th&nbsp;Canadian Infantry Brigade]], one of two [[brigades]] in the division,{{#tag:ref|The other battalions in the brigade were: [[The Lincoln and Welland Regiment]]; and [[The Algonquin Regiment]].{{sfn|Canadian Soldier|2019}}|group=Note}} made an assault crossing of the [[Ems (river)|Ems]] river and captured the town of [[Meppen]], suffering only one casualty. German prisoners included several 17-year-old youths with less than eight weeks of military experience.{{sfn|Stacey|1960|p=557}}\n\nThe division advanced a further {{convert|25|km}} to S\u00f6gel, which the 1st&nbsp;Battalion of [[Lake Superior Regiment|The Lake Superior Regiment (Motor)]]{{#tag:ref|The Lake Superior Regiment (Motor) was the infantry part of [[4th Canadian Armoured Brigade]] which also included: 21st Armoured Regiment ([[The Governor General's Foot Guards]]); 22nd&nbsp;Armoured Regiment ([[The Canadian Grenadier Guards]]); and 28th&nbsp;Armoured Regiment ([[The British Columbia Regiment]]).{{sfn|Canadian Soldier|2019}}|group=Note}} captured on 9&nbsp;April. The following day it repulsed several German counter-attacks before the town was declared cleared.{{sfn|Williams|1988|p=276}}{{sfn|Stacey|1960|p=558}} Some German civilians joined the fighting and were believed to have killed several Canadian soldiers. Vokes, believing the civilians needed to be taught a lesson, ordered the destruction of the centre of the town.{{sfn|Morton|2016|}} This was accomplished with several truckloads of dynamite. Vokes was aware that these actions violated the [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907|Hague Conventions]] and took care not to issue written instructions.{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|pp=258\u2013259}} Soldiers of the division started referring to Vokes as \"The Sod of S\u00f6gel\".{{sfn|Foster|2000|page=437}} The Canadian Army official history states: {{quote|Investigation established that German civilians had taken part in this fighting and had been responsible for the loss of Canadian lives.

The Argylls conducted a flanking night march and launched a dawn assault on 14&nbsp;April. The attack met only scattered resistance from a disorganized garrison, and the Argylls secured the town by 10:30. During the confused fighting, approximately 50&nbsp;German soldiers{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|p=257}} caught Wigle's tactical headquarters by surprise at around 08:30.

The [[4th Canadian (Armoured) Division]] attacked the German-held town of [[Friesoythe]] and one of its [[battalion]]s, [[Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada (Princess Louise's)|The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada]], captured it.\n\nDuring the fighting the battalion's commander was killed by a German soldier, but it was incorrectly rumoured that he had been killed by a civilian. Under this mistaken belief, the division's commander, [[Major General|Major-General]] [[Christopher Vokes]], ordered that the town be razed in [[Reprisal|retaliation]] and it was substantially destroyed. Twenty German civilians died in Friesoythe and the surrounding area during the two days of fighting and its aftermath. Similar, if usually less extreme, events occurred elsewhere in Germany as the Allies advanced in the closing weeks of the war.\n\nThe rubble of the town was used to fill craters in local roads to make them passable for the division's tanks and heavy vehicles. A few days earlier, the division had destroyed the centre of [[S\u00f6gel]] in another reprisal and also used the rubble to make the roads passable. Little official notice was taken of the incident and the [[Official History of the Canadian Army in the Second World War|Canadian Army official history]] glosses over it. It is covered in the regimental histories of the units involved and several accounts of the campaign. Forty years later, Vokes wrote in his autobiography that he had \"no great remorse over the elimination of Friesoythe\".\n\n==Context==\n===Allied tactics===\nBy September 1944, the [[Allies of World War II|Western Allies]] had reached [[Nazi Germany|Germany's]] western border,{{sfn|Ambrose|1997|p=117}} and by the end of October had [[Battle of Aachen|captured Aachen]], the first major German city to fall to them.{{sfn|Hastings|2004|pp=106\u2013107}} Over the following six months they overran much of western Germany. In November the [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force]] (SHAEF) publicly stated that the forces of the Western Allies would strictly adhere to international law in respect of their treatment of civilians.{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|p=256}} However, SHAEF's manual ''Combating the Guerrilla'' stated that there were circumstances where commanders could take \"stern measures\" against civilians as a [[reprisal|rapid response]] to guerrilla attacks, although this was in breach of the [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907|Hague Conventions]].{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|p=256}}\n\nThe frequency and nature of retaliatory actions differed between national contingents within the Western Allied forces.{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|p=257}} Following SHAEF's policy, [[United States Army]] forces destroyed German buildings on several occasions, sometimes entire villages, and took other measures against German civilians. French troops took a similar, if more rigorous, approach to that of the Americans.{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|pp=258\u2013259}} The British commanders disapproved of retaliations against civilians, and British troops carried out few reprisals.{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|p=257}}\n\nThe [[First Canadian Army]] served in the predominately British [[21st Army Group]], and more frequently retaliated against German civilians than the British.{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|p=257}} The commander of [[4th Canadian Division|4th&nbsp;Canadian (Armoured) Division]], Major-General [[Christopher Vokes]], believed that destroying property{{discuss}}<!--meaning buildings?  there are many kinds of property--> was the most appropriate way of responding to resistance by German civilians. The division carried out actions against German property more often than any other Canadian formation.{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|pp=258\u2013259}}\n\n[[Red Army|Soviet forces]] conducted retaliatory actions much more frequently than their Western Allies. The [[Soviet Union]]'s leadership was concerned about the threat of a [[Werwolf|Nazi resistance movement]], and Soviet forces killed, raped and imprisoned large numbers of local civilians and destroyed property following guerrilla attacks.{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|pp=268\u2013270}}\n\n===Allied attitudes===\n\nThe attitude towards the Germans throughout the Allied ranks was harsh. There was frustration at their continued resistance in a clearly hopeless cause, anger at the casualties they inflicted when the war was widely, and correctly, perceived to be almost over, and a general feeling that severe, even ruthless, treatment of German soldiers and civilians was justified.{{sfn|Atkinson|2015|p=597}} On 15&nbsp;April the British reached [[Bergen-Belsen concentration camp]], where the inmates had been reduced to cannibalism.{{sfn|Atkinson|2015|p=599}} The historian [[Rick Atkinson]] wrote that \"the revelations of April&nbsp;... sparked enduring outrage\".{{sfn|Atkinson|2015|p=604}}\n\nThis was the case at all levels. An American officer wrote \"The attitude of higher command seemed to be that these people&nbsp;... should be made to feel the full significance of war and what their troops had done to other people.\"{{sfn|Hastings|2004|pp=493\u2013494}} The US general [[George Patton]] wrote in his diary \"In hundreds of villages&nbsp;... most of the houses are heaps of stone&nbsp;... I did most of it.\" When a [[sniper]] fired at one of his officers, he ordered several German houses to be burnt.{{sfn|Atkinson|2015|p=568}} When the commander of US [[3rd Armored Division (United States)|3rd Armored Division]] was killed in action {{convert|150|mi|km|disp=flip}} inside Germany on 30&nbsp;March, several villages were razed by his irate troops, captured wounded Germans were shot on the spot and at least 45&nbsp;Germans were executed after surrendering.{{sfn|Atkinson|2015|pp=581\u2013582}} An artillery officer wrote home in April \"we should fire about a thousand rounds into every [German] town. Do them good\".{{sfn|Atkinson|2015|p=598}} At least one British battalion refused to take [[Waffen-SS]] prisoners, shooting those who surrendered; an officer of the battalion blamed this on SS \"truculence\".{{sfn|Hastings|2004|p=499}} A British battalion commander summed up the risk-averse attitude within his unit: \"At this stage of the war, no one was very keen to earn medals.\"{{sfn|Hastings|2004|p=492}} A British pilot wrote: \"It seemed a stupid time to die.\"{{sfn|Hastings|2004|p=492}} A British [[corporal]] spoke for many when he wrote \"Why don't the silly bastards give up?\"{{sfn|Atkinson|2015|p=597}} Some divisions had suffered their last fatality by mid-April.{{sfn|Hastings|2004|p=500}} The historian [[Max Hastings]] wrote \"The final Anglo-American drive across Germany offered ... many foolish little battles which wasted men's lives\".{{sfn|Hastings|2004|p=491}}\n\n===Battle for S\u00f6gel===\n[[File:Moncel and Vokes.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|right|alt=Major-General Christopher Vokes in discussion with Brigadier Robert Moncel standing in a street in S\u00f6gel on 10&nbsp;April 1945|{{center|Major-General [[Christopher Vokes]] (right) with Brigadier [[Robert Moncel]] at S\u00f6gel on 10 April 1945.}}]]\nIn early April 1945 the 4th&nbsp;Canadian (Armoured) Division, as part of [[II&nbsp;Canadian Corps]], moved out of the eastern Netherlands in the wake of the Allied crossing of the [[Rhine]] in [[Operation Plunder]]. On 4&nbsp;April, [[Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada (Princess Louise's)|The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders of Canada]], part of the [[10th&nbsp;Canadian Infantry Brigade]], one of two [[brigades]] in the division,{{#tag:ref|The other battalions in the brigade were: [[The Lincoln and Welland Regiment]]; and [[The Algonquin Regiment]].{{sfn|Canadian Soldier|2019}}|group=Note}} made an assault crossing of the [[Ems (river)|Ems]] river and captured the town of [[Meppen]], suffering only one casualty. German prisoners included several 17-year-old youths with less than eight weeks of military experience.{{sfn|Stacey|1960|p=557}}\n\nThe division advanced a further {{convert|25|km}} to S\u00f6gel, which the 1st&nbsp;Battalion of [[Lake Superior Regiment|The Lake Superior Regiment (Motor)]]{{#tag:ref|The Lake Superior Regiment (Motor) was the infantry part of [[4th Canadian Armoured Brigade]] which also included: 21st Armoured Regiment ([[The Governor General's Foot Guards]]); 22nd&nbsp;Armoured Regiment ([[The Canadian Grenadier Guards]]); and 28th&nbsp;Armoured Regiment ([[The British Columbia Regiment]]).{{sfn|Canadian Soldier|2019}}|group=Note}} captured on 9&nbsp;April. The following day it repulsed several German counter-attacks before the town was declared cleared.{{sfn|Williams|1988|p=276}}{{sfn|Stacey|1960|p=558}} Some German civilians joined the fighting and were believed to have killed several Canadian soldiers. Vokes, believing the civilians needed to be taught a lesson, ordered the destruction of the centre of the town.{{sfn|Morton|2016|}} This was accomplished with several truckloads of dynamite. Vokes was aware that these actions violated the [[Hague Conventions of 1899 and 1907|Hague Conventions]] and took care not to issue written instructions.{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|pp=258\u2013259}} Soldiers of the division started referring to Vokes as \"The Sod of S\u00f6gel\".{{sfn|Foster|2000|page=437}} The Canadian Army official history states: {{quote|Investigation established that German civilians had taken part in this fighting and had been responsible for the loss of Canadian lives. Accordingly, as a [[reprisal]] and a warning, several houses in the centre of S\u00f6gel were ordered destroyed by the engineers to provide rubble.{{sfn|Stacey|1960|p=558}}}}\n\n==Battle for Friesoythe==\n\nThe Canadian advance continued across the [[Westphalian Lowland]], reaching the outskirts of Friesoythe, a strategic crossroads, on 13&nbsp;April. As it was early spring, the ground was sodden and heavy vehicles could not operate off the main roads.{{sfn|Stacey|1960|p=558}} This made Friesoythe, {{convert|20|mi|km|disp=flip}} west of [[Oldenburg]], on the River [[Soeste]], a potential bottleneck. If the Germans were to hold it, the bulk of the Canadians would be unable to continue their advance.{{sfn|Zuehlke|2010|page=305}} Most of the population of 4,000 had evacuated to the countryside on 11\u201312 April.{{#tag:ref|The Friesoythe Amtsgericht, or District Court, was closed on 11&nbsp; April. If the District Court ceased to function on 11&nbsp;April 1945, the evacuation of the bulk of the civilian population probably took place between 11&nbsp;and 12&nbsp;April. This was clearly a German initiative.{{sfn|Cloppenburg|2003|pp=165, 189}}{{sfn|Brockhaus|1996|p=730}}|group=Note}} Several hundred paratroopers from Battalion Raabe of the German [[7th Parachute Division (Germany)|7th&nbsp;Parachute Division]] and anti-tank guns defended the town.{{sfn|Zuehlke|2010|page=305}}{{sfn|Sirluck|1945|}} The paratroopers repelled an attack by the Lake Superior Regiment, which suffered several killed and wounded; German casualties are unknown.{{sfn|Marsh|2015|}}\n\nVokes ordered the resumption of the attack by the 1st&nbsp;Battalion, The Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders (Princess Louise's), commanded by [[Lieutenant-colonel (Canada)|Lieutenant-Colonel]] Frederick Wigle. The Argylls conducted a flanking night march and launched a dawn assault on 14&nbsp;April. The attack met only scattered resistance from a disorganized garrison, and the Argylls secured the town by 10:30. During the confused fighting, approximately 50&nbsp;German soldiers{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|p=257}} caught Wigle's tactical headquarters by surprise at around 08:30. A firefight broke out, resulting in the death of Wigle and several other soldiers. A rumour circulated that a local civilian had shot Wigle.{{sfn|Zuehlke|2010|page=308}}{{sfn|A&SHC archive|1945}}{{sfn|Fraser|1996|p=431}}\n\n===Destruction of Friesoythe===\nVokes was furious when he heard of Wigle's death. He wrote in his autobiography that \"a first-rate officer of mine, for whom I had a special regard and affection, and in whom I had a particular professional interest because of his talent for command, was killed. Not merely killed, it was reported to me, but sniped in the back\". Vokes wrote, \"I summoned my {{Abbr|GSO1|general staff officer}}... 'Mac,' I roared at him, 'I'm going to raze that goddam town. Tell 'em we're going to level the fucking place. Get the people the hell out of their houses first.{{'\"}}{{sfn|Foster|2000|page=437}}{{sfn|Vokes|1985|pages=194\u2013195}} Vokes's [[Staff_(military)#British_and_Commonwealth_staff|GSO1 (head of the operations staff)]], Lieutenant-Colonel Mackenzie Robinson, obeyed but convinced him to not put this order in writing or issue a proclamation to the local civilians.{{sfn|Foster|2000|page=437}}{{sfn|Briddiscombe|1998|pp=259, 295}} Hastings writes that the earlier incident at S\u00f6gel contributed to Vokes's fury.{{sfn|Hastings|2004|p=500}}\n\nThe Argylls had spontaneously begun to burn Friesoythe in reprisal for the death of their commander.{{sfn|Fraser|1996|pp=435\u2013437}} After Vokes had issued his order, the town was systematically set on fire with [[flamethrowers]] mounted on [[Universal Carrier|Wasp Carriers]]. In the side streets, soldiers threw petrol containers into buildings and ignited them with [[White phosphorus munitions|phosphorus grenades]]. The attack continued for over eight hours and Friesoythe was almost totally destroyed.{{sfn|Zuehlke|2010|page=308}} As the commanding officer of the 1st&nbsp;Battalion, [[The Algonquin Regiment]] later wrote, \"the raging Highlanders cleared the remainder of that town as no town has been cleared for centuries, we venture to say\".{{sfn|Cassidy|1948|p=307}} The war diary of the 4th&nbsp;Canadian Armoured Brigade records, \"when darkness fell Friesoythe was a reasonable facsimile of Dante's Inferno\".{{sfn|Zuehlke|2010|page=309}}\n\nThe Canadian official history states that Friesoythe \"was set on fire in a mistaken reprisal\".{{sfn|Stacey|1960|p=722}} The rubble was used to reinforce the local roads for the division's tanks and heavy transport, which had been unable to move up due to the main roads near the town being badly cratered, and the smaller roads being inadequate to stand their weight.{{sfn|Rogers|1989|p=259}}{{sfn|Granatstein|2010|p=16}}\n\n===Civilian casualties and damage===\nDuring the fighting around Friesoythe and its aftermath, ten civilians from the town and another ten from the surrounding villages were killed.{{sfn|Stadt Friesoythe|2018}} There were reports of civilians lying dead in the streets.{{sfn|Zuehlke|2010|page=308}} According to one German assessment, 85\u201390 per cent of the town was destroyed during the reprisal.{{sfn|Cloppenburg|2003|p=189}} The {{Lang|de|Brockhaus Enzyklopaedie}} estimates the destruction to have been as high as 90 per cent.

In the 1960s and 1970s several high-rise buildings were built, located sporadically, mostly in the western side of [[Central London]] with some in the [[City of London]]. The first true \"skyscrapers\" to be built in London were the [[Tower 42|NatWest Tower]] (now called Tower 42) which was completed in 1980 in the City of London at {{convert|183|m|ft}} tall and [[One Canada Square]] which was completed in 1991 at {{convert|235|m|ft}} and formed the centrepiece of the [[Canary Wharf]] development.

The seven parties participating in the elections represented a broad spectrum of political ideologies.\" The general counsel of New York's [[Human Rights Commission]] described the election as \"free, fair and hotly contested.\" A study by the US [[Latin American Studies Association]] (LASA) concluded that the FSLN (Sandinista Front) \"did little more to take advantage of its incumbency than incumbent parties everywhere (including the U.S.) routinely do.\" However some people described the election as \"rigged\". According to a detailed study, since the 1984 election was for posts subordinate to the Sandinista Directorate, the elections were no more subject to approval by vote than the Central Committee of the Communist Party is in countries of the East Bloc.<ref>Martin Kriele, \u201cPower and Human Rights in Nicaragua,\u201d German Comments, April 1986, pp. 56\u20137, 63\u20137, a chapter excerpted from his Nicaragua: Das blutende Herz Amerikas (Piper, 1986).

Chamorro was supported by the US and a 14-party anti-Sandinista alliance known as the [[National Opposition Union]] (Uni\u00f3n Nacional Oppositora, UNO), an alliance that ranged from conservatives and liberals to communists.

In Ortega's concession speech the following day he vowed to keep \"ruling from below\" a reference to the power that the FSLN still wielded in various sectors. He also stressed his belief that the Sandinistas had the goal of bringing \"dignity\" to Latin America, and not necessarily to hold on to government posts. In 1991, Ortega claimed elections were \u201can instrument to reaffirm\u201d the FSLN's \u201cpolitical and ideological positions,\u201d and also \u201cconfront capitalism.\u201d{{sfn|Baltodano|2012|p=70}} However, the electoral loss led to pronounced divisions in the FSLN. Some members adopted more pragmatic positions, and sought to transform the FSLN into a modern social democratic party engaged in national reconciliation and class cooperation. Ortega and other party insiders found common ground with the radicals, who still promoted anti-imperialism and class conflict to achieve social change.<ref name=\"FSLNPostCollapse\" />\n\nPossible explanations for his loss include that the Nicaraguan people were disenchanted with the Ortega government as well as the fact that already in November 1989, the White House had announced that the economic embargo against Nicaragua would continue unless [[Violeta Chamorro]] won.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20130117074255/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1222025.html \"Bush Vows to End Embargo if Chamorro Wins\"], ''The Washington Post,'' November 9, 1989</ref> Also, there had been reports of intimidation from the side of the contras,<ref>{{cite report|publisher=Human Rights Watch|title=Human Rights Watch World Report 1989|chapter=Nicaragua|url=https://www.hrw.org/legacy/reports/1989/WR89/index.htm|date=1990|access-date=9 March 2016|chapter-url=https://www.hrw.org/legacy/reports/1989/WR89/Nicaragu.htm|quote=The policy of keeping the contras alive ... also has placed in jeopardy the holding of elections by encouraging contra attacks on the electoral process.

In these elections, a key issue was the allegation of corruption. In Ortega's last days as president, through a series of legislative acts known as \"The [[Pi\u00f1ata]]\", estates that had been seized by the Sandinista government (some valued at millions and even billions of US dollars) became the private property of various FSLN officials, including Ortega himself.<ref>{{Cite news|author=Shirley Christian |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/06/08/world/managua-journal-victor-s-lament-to-the-losers-belong-the-spoils.html |title=Managua Journal; Victor's Lament: To the Losers Belong the Spoils \u2013 New York Times |location=Nicaragua |publisher=Nytimes.com |date= 1991-06-08|accessdate=2014-08-18|newspaper=The New York Times }}</ref>\n\nIn the 1996 campaign, Ortega faced the Liberal Alliance (Alianza Liberal), headed by [[Arnoldo Alem\u00e1n|Arnoldo Aleman Lacayo]], a former mayor of Managua.

The controversial alliance of Nicaragua's two major parties is aimed at distributing power between the PLC and FSLN, and preventing other parties from rising. After sealing the agreement in January 2000, the two parties controlled the three key institutions of the state: the Comptroller General of the Republic, the [[Supreme Court of Justice (Nicaragua)|Supreme Court]], and the Supreme Electoral Council.<ref name=\"FSLNAdaptation\"/> ''\"El Pacto,\"'' as it is known in Nicaragua, is said to have personally benefited former presidents Ortega and Alem\u00e1n greatly, while constraining then-president Bola\u00f1os.

Once the main collective leadership body of the party, with nine members, the DN no longer met routinely, and only three historic members remained.

The seven parties participating in the elections represented a broad spectrum of political ideologies.\" The general counsel of New York's [[Human Rights Commission]] described the election as \"free, fair and hotly contested.\" A study by the US [[Latin American Studies Association]] (LASA) concluded that the FSLN (Sandinista Front) \"did little more to take advantage of its incumbency than incumbent parties everywhere (including the U.S.) routinely do.\" However some people described the election as \"rigged\". According to a detailed study, since the 1984 election was for posts subordinate to the Sandinista Directorate, the elections were no more subject to approval by vote than the Central Committee of the Communist Party is in countries of the East Bloc.<ref>Martin Kriele, \u201cPower and Human Rights in Nicaragua,\u201d German Comments, April 1986, pp. 56\u20137, 63\u20137, a chapter excerpted from his Nicaragua: Das blutende Herz Amerikas (Piper, 1986).

Chamorro was supported by the US and a 14-party anti-Sandinista alliance known as the [[National Opposition Union]] (Uni\u00f3n Nacional Oppositora, UNO), an alliance that ranged from conservatives and liberals to communists.

In Ortega's concession speech the following day he vowed to keep \"ruling from below\" a reference to the power that the FSLN still wielded in various sectors. He also stressed his belief that the Sandinistas had the goal of bringing \"dignity\" to Latin America, and not necessarily to hold on to government posts. In 1991, Ortega claimed elections were \u201can instrument to reaffirm\u201d the FSLN's \u201cpolitical and ideological positions,\u201d and also \u201cconfront capitalism.\u201d{{sfn|Baltodano|2012|p=70}} However, the electoral loss led to pronounced divisions in the FSLN. Some members adopted more pragmatic positions, and sought to transform the FSLN into a modern social democratic party engaged in national reconciliation and class cooperation. Ortega and other party insiders found common ground with the radicals, who still promoted anti-imperialism and class conflict to achieve social change.<ref name=\"FSLNPostCollapse\" />\n\nPossible explanations for his loss include that the Nicaraguan people were disenchanted with the Ortega government as well as the fact that already in November 1989, the White House had announced that the economic embargo against Nicaragua would continue unless [[Violeta Chamorro]] won.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20130117074255/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1222025.html \"Bush Vows to End Embargo if Chamorro Wins\"], ''The Washington Post,'' November 9, 1989</ref> Also, there had been reports of intimidation from the side of the contras,<ref>{{cite report|publisher=Human Rights Watch|title=Human Rights Watch World Report 1989|chapter=Nicaragua|url=https://www.hrw.org/legacy/reports/1989/WR89/index.htm|date=1990|access-date=9 March 2016|chapter-url=https://www.hrw.org/legacy/reports/1989/WR89/Nicaragu.htm|quote=The policy of keeping the contras alive ... also has placed in jeopardy the holding of elections by encouraging contra attacks on the electoral process.

In these elections, a key issue was the allegation of corruption. In Ortega's last days as president, through a series of legislative acts known as \"The [[Pi\u00f1ata]]\", estates that had been seized by the Sandinista government (some valued at millions and even billions of US dollars) became the private property of various FSLN officials, including Ortega himself.<ref>{{Cite news|author=Shirley Christian |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/06/08/world/managua-journal-victor-s-lament-to-the-losers-belong-the-spoils.html |title=Managua Journal; Victor's Lament: To the Losers Belong the Spoils \u2013 New York Times |location=Nicaragua |publisher=Nytimes.com |date= 1991-06-08|accessdate=2014-08-18|newspaper=The New York Times }}</ref>\n\nIn the 1996 campaign, Ortega faced the Liberal Alliance (Alianza Liberal), headed by [[Arnoldo Alem\u00e1n|Arnoldo Aleman Lacayo]], a former mayor of Managua.

The controversial alliance of Nicaragua's two major parties is aimed at distributing power between the PLC and FSLN, and preventing other parties from rising. After sealing the agreement in January 2000, the two parties controlled the three key institutions of the state: the Comptroller General of the Republic, the [[Supreme Court of Justice (Nicaragua)|Supreme Court]], and the Supreme Electoral Council.<ref name=\"FSLNAdaptation\"/> ''\"El Pacto,\"'' as it is known in Nicaragua, is said to have personally benefited former presidents Ortega and Alem\u00e1n greatly, while constraining then-president Bola\u00f1os.

Once the main collective leadership body of the party, with nine members, the DN no longer met routinely, and only three historic members remained.
