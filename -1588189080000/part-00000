While Kodak Black was not in the vehicle at the time, the FBI found weapons in the vehicle and detained a few of Kodak Black's crew members. Allegedly, the FBI attempted to enter the club in which Kodak Black was performing, but denied entry by the owner. [[TMZ]] stated it was \"unclear\" whether or not the bus was actually owned by Kodak Black. This came a week after his arrest at the US-Canada border. It was stated Kodak Black himself did not get in trouble with law enforcement.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Shifferaw |first1=Abel |title=FBI Raided Kodak Black's Tour Buses While Rapper Was Performing in Washington D.C. |url=https://www.complex.com/music/2019/04/kodak-black-tour-bus-reportedly-raided-by-cops-fbi-in-washington-dc |website=complex.com |publisher=Complex |accessdate=25 April 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Centeno |first1=Tony |title=BUS OUTSIDE KODAK BLACK SHOW RAIDED BY FBI: REPORT |url=https://www.xxlmag.com/news/2019/04/kodak-black-fbi-raid/ |website=xxxlmag.com |publisher=XXL Magazine |accessdate=25 April 2019}}</ref>\n\nOn May 11, 2019, while preparing to perform at [[Rolling Loud]] Miami, Kodak Black was arrested on firearm charges before he could perform.

He filed to use his $600,000 home as collateral for his $500,000 bond for the indictments and was granted the bond, being released. He reportedly faces up to 10 years in prison on the charges, and plead not guilty on May 15. Federal prosecutors, however, are attempting to revoke Kodak Black's bail, pointing to past violent crimes, such as a 2012 carjacking incident, and his possible connections to a shooting in March. The new arrest may also cause his bond in the 2016 South Carolina rape case to be revoked. Federal prosecutors stated that he is a danger to society due to his long history of criminal acts as well as his repeated violation of past probation rules. Kodak Black's lawyer stated that he voluntarily turned himself in upon hearing of a warrant, and is not a danger to society due to the crime being non-violent.<ref>{{cite web |title=Rapper Kodak Black pleads not guilty to weapons charges |url=https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/rapper-kodak-black-not-guilty-weapons-charges |website=foxnews.com |publisher=Fox News |accessdate=18 May 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Muhammad |first1=Latifah |title=Federal Prosecutors Reportedly Claim Kodak Black Is A Danger To Society |url=https://www.vibe.com/2019/05/prosecutors-kodak-black-danger-to-society |website=vibe.com |publisher=Vibe |accessdate=18 May 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Fitzgerald |first1=Trent |title=FEDERAL PROSECUTORS SAY KODAK BLACK NEEDS TO STAY IN JAIL: REPORT |url=https://www.xxlmag.com/news/2019/05/prosecutors-kodak-black-jail/ |website=xxlmag.com |publisher=XXL Magazine |accessdate=18 May 2019}}</ref> It was reported by [[TMZ]] on November 13, 2019 that Kodak Black had taken a [[plea bargain]] and had been sentenced to 46 months in prison, a drastically shorter sentence than the 96 months that the courts had been considering as the rapper had been involved in a fight while incarcerated that involved injury to a prison guard.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.tmz.com/2019/11/13/kodak-black-sentenced-46-months-prison-federal-gun-case/|title=Kodak Black Gets Nearly 4 Years in Prison in Federal Gun Case|website=TMZ|language=en|access-date=2019-11-13}}</ref>\n\nOn March 11, 2020, Kodak plead guilty to a firearms possession case he was charged with after being detained at the Canadian-American border with a glock.

This elite unit brings to bear all their talents, intellect, and technical expertise on major cases in order to keep New York and the country safe. Born into a multi-generational law enforcement family, Special Agent Maggie Bell commits deeply to the people she works with as well as those she protects. Her partner is Special Agent Omar Adom \"O.{{nbsp}}A.\" Zidan, a West Point graduate from Bushwick who spent two years undercover for the DEA before being cherry-picked by the FBI. Overseeing them is Special Agent in Charge Dana Mosier, who operates under intense pressure and has undeniable command authority. The team also includes Assistant Special Agent in Charge Jubal Valentine, the nerve center of the office whose ability to easily relate to and engage with both superiors and subordinates makes him a master motivator. Kristen Chazal is the team's most valued resource, a brilliant analyst recruited straight out of college who can piece together the big picture faster than anyone.

This elite unit brings to bear all their talents, intellect, and technical expertise on major cases in order to keep New York and the country safe. Born into a multi-generational law enforcement family, Special Agent Maggie Bell commits deeply to the people she works with as well as those she protects. Her partner is Special Agent Omar Adom \"O.{{nbsp}}A.\" Zidan, a West Point graduate from Bushwick who spent two years undercover for the DEA before being cherry-picked by the FBI. Overseeing them is Special Agent in Charge Dana Mosier, who operates under intense pressure and has undeniable command authority. The team also includes Assistant Special Agent in Charge Jubal Valentine, the nerve center of the office whose ability to easily relate to and engage with both superiors and subordinates makes him a master motivator. Kristen Chazal is the team's most valued resource, a brilliant analyst recruited straight out of college who can piece together the big picture faster than anyone.
