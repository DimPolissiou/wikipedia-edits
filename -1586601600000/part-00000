Though he enjoyed the experience of shooting the film, he opted not to sign a three-film contract when it was over.  After eschewing a career in film and theatre, Ostrum became reluctant to speak about his one starring role.  In 1990, he began an annual tradition of speaking to schoolchildren about the film, and he became a subject of interest again when the 2005 film ''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film)|Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]]'' was released to theaters.\n\nOstrum became interested in horses when he returned from shooting ''Willy Wonka'', and was particularly influenced by the veterinarian that tended to them.  Receiving his [[veterinary physician|Doctorate of Veterinary Medicine]] from [[Cornell University College of Veterinary Medicine]] in 1984, {{as of|2005|lc=yes}} Ostrum practiced and lived in [[Lowville (village), New York|Lowville, New York]] with his wife Loretta ({{n\u00e9e|Lepkowski}}), and two children: son, Leif, and daughter, Helenka.\n\n==Personal life==\nPeter Gardner<ref name=\"2011 I Want It Now\" /> Ostrum was born in [[Dallas]]<ref name=\"2005-07-18 MSNBC\" /><ref name=\"2006-01-03 DMN\" /> on November 1, 1957 to Dean Gardner Ostrum (1922\u20132014) and Sarepta Mabel {{nee|Pierpont}} (born 1922).

Two months later Ostrum was called to New York for a [[screen test]] where he sang \"[[My Country, 'Tis of Thee]]\",<ref name=\"2011 I Want It Now\" /> and a month after that he was contacted and given ten days to prepare to leave for filming.<ref name=\"avma20001101\">{{cite journal\n| date        = 2000-11-01\n| title       = Dr. Ostrum and the chocolate factory\n| journal     = Journal of the American Veterinary Medical Association\n| publisher   = [[American Veterinary Medical Association]]\n| location    = [[Schaumburg, Illinois]], U.S.\n| url         = http://www.avma.org/onlnews/javma/nov00/s110100g.asp\n| accessdate  = 2009-10-11\n| archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20120524221856/http://www.avma.org/onlnews/javma/nov00/s110100g.asp\n| archivedate = 2012-05-24\n| url-status    = dead\n}}</ref>  Ostrum left for [[Munich]] on August 10, 1970.<ref name=\"1996 GMMTB\" />\n\n{{quote box\n | quote  = Peter was a child who acted&mdash;he wasn't a [[child actor]].

Though he enjoyed the experience of shooting the film, he opted not to sign a three-film contract when it was over.  After eschewing a career in film and theatre, Ostrum became reluctant to speak about his one starring role.  In 1990, he began an annual tradition of speaking to schoolchildren about the film, and he became a subject of interest again when the 2005 film ''[[Charlie and the Chocolate Factory (film)|Charlie and the Chocolate Factory]]'' was released to theaters.\n\nOstrum became interested in horses when he returned from shooting ''Willy Wonka'', and was particularly influenced by the veterinarian that tended to them.

For instance, when a hammer is used to knock in a nail, we do not attend to the hammer in itself but are aware of it only as a \"ready-to-hand\" extension of ourselves to achieve a future result: the knocking in of the nail. The past (the existing or \"given\" hammer) is reduced to a future usefulness (the driven nail). ''Zuhanden'' (readiness-to-hand), in which the distinction between subject and object is blurred, is one of three modes of Being that Heidegger identified \u2013 the others being ''Vorhanden'' (presence-at-hand), for things that are there but that we don't interact with, and ''Dasein'' (human existence).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://compendium.kosawese.net/term/present-at-hand-vorhanden-and-ready-to-hand-zuhanden/|title=Present-at-hand (Vorhanden) and Ready-to-hand (Zuhanden) &#124; MANE Compendium}}</ref>\n\nHeidegger claimed philosophy and science since ancient Greece had reduced things to their presence, which was a superficial way of understanding them. One crucial source of this insight was Heidegger's reading of [[Franz Brentano]]'s treatise on Aristotle's manifold uses of the word \"being\", a work which provoked Heidegger to ask what kind of unity underlies this multiplicity of uses. Heidegger opens his magnum opus, ''Being and Time'', with a citation from [[Plato]]'s ''[[Sophist (dialogue)|Sophist]]''<ref>For a study on Heidegger's reading of the ''Sophist'' and his less central interest in Plato's ''Timaeus'' and its conception of ''space'' qua ''kh\u00f4ra'': see: [[Nader El-Bizri]], \"''On kai kh\u00f4ra'': Situating Heidegger between the ''Sophist'' and the ''Timaeus''\", ''Studia Phaenomenologica'', Vol. IV, Issue 1\u20132 (2004), pp. 73\u201398.  This study is also closely connected with an investigation of Heidegger's later reflections on 'dwelling' as set in: [[Nader El-Bizri]], 'Being at Home Among Things: Heidegger\u2019s Reflections on Dwelling', Environment, Space, Place 3 (2011), pp. 47\u201371.  Refer also to other aspects of this research under the section of 'Heidegger and Eastern Thought', and also the influence on architectural thinking in the main body of the text above</ref> indicating that Western philosophy has neglected Being because it was considered too obvious to question. Heidegger's intuition about the question of Being is thus a historical argument, which in his later work becomes his concern with the \"history of Being\", that is, the history of the forgetting of Being, which according to Heidegger requires that philosophy retrace its footsteps through a productive [[Heideggerian terminology|destruction]] of the history of philosophy.<ref>[[Edward Craig (philosopher)|Craig, E.]], ed., ''The Shorter Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (London / New York: Routledge, 2005), [https://books.google.com/books?id=Z_Z-AgAAQBAJ&pg=PA363 p. 363].</ref>{{rp|363}}\n\nThe second intuition animating Heidegger's philosophy derives from the influence of Husserl, a philosopher largely uninterested in questions of philosophical history. Rather, Husserl argued that all that philosophy could and should be is a description of experience (hence the phenomenological slogan, \"to the things themselves\"). But for Heidegger, this meant understanding that experience is [[world disclosure|always already situated in a world]] and in ways of being. Thus Husserl's understanding that all consciousness is \"[[intentionality|intentional]]\" (in the sense that it is always intended ''toward'' something, and is always \"about\" something) is transformed in Heidegger's philosophy, becoming the thought that all experience is grounded in Sorge, which means the anxiety or worrifulness arising out of concern about the future\u2014referring to the inner state of being as well as external causality of that being. Heidegger also employs two cognates of Sorge; Besorgen - provision of something for oneself or someone else, and Fursorge - solicitude or caring for another in need of help. This thicket of meaning around care/concern (Sorge) is the basis of Heidegger's \"existential analytic\", as he develops it in ''Being and Time''.<ref>{{cite book | last = Inwood | first = M. J. | title = A Heidegger dictionary | publisher = Blackwell Publishers | location = Malden, Mass | year = 2000 | isbn = 9780631190943 }}</ref> Heidegger argues that describing experience properly entails finding the being for whom such a description might matter. Heidegger thus conducts his description of experience with reference to \"''[[Dasein]]''\", the being for whom Being is a question. In everyday German, \"''Dasein''\" means \"existence.\" It is composed of \"''Da''\" (here/there) and \"''Sein''\" (being). ''Dasein'' is transformed in Heidegger's usage from its everyday meaning to refer, rather, to that being that is ''there'' in its world, that is, the being for whom being matters. In later publications Heidegger writes the term in hyphenated form as ''Da-sein'', thus emphasizing the distance from the word's ordinary usage.<ref>Powell, J., ''Heidegger's Contributions to Philosophy: Life and the Last God'' (New York: [[Continuum International Publishing Group]], 2007), [https://books.google.com/books?id=45rUAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA137 p. 137].</ref>\n\nIn ''Being and Time'', Heidegger criticized the abstract and metaphysical character of traditional ways of grasping human existence as rational animal, person, man, soul, spirit, or subject. ''Dasein'', then, is not intended as a way of conducting a [[philosophical anthropology]], but is rather understood by Heidegger to be the condition of possibility for anything ''like'' a philosophical anthropology.<ref>Jacques Derrida describes this in the following terms: \"We can see then that Dasein, though ''not'' man, is nevertheless ''nothing other'' than man.\" Jacques Derrida, \"The Ends of Man\", ''Margins of Philosophy'' (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1982), p. 127.</ref> ''Dasein'', according to Heidegger, ''is'' care.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Blair|first1=Michael|title=\"Heidegger and Aquinas on the Self as Substance\", in Postmodernism and Christian Philosophy edited by Roman Theodore Ciapalo|date=1997|publisher=Amer Maritain Assoc|location=Mishawaka IN|isbn=978-0813208817|pages=39\u201346|url=https://books.google.com/?id=rQneikLwaMoC&pg=PA39&dq=Dasein,+according+to+Heidegger,+is+care#v=onepage&q=Dasein%2C%20according%20to%20Heidegger%2C%20is%20care&f=false|accessdate=27 April 2017}}</ref> The world confronts ''Dasein'' with possibilities. It is not completely deterministic; ''Dasein'' has choices. But ''Dasein'' cannot choose not to face the possibilities presented by the world, including the inevitability of its own mortality. Heidegger in his existential analytic refers to this condition as being \"thrown into the world\", or \"[[thrownness]]\" (''Geworfenheit''). The need for ''Dasein'' to assume these possibilities, that is, the need to be responsible for one's own existence, is the basis of Heidegger's notions of authenticity and resoluteness\u2014that is, of those specific possibilities for ''Dasein'' which depend on escaping the \"vulgar\" temporality of calculation and of public life.\n\nThe marriage of these two observations depends on the fact that each of them is essentially concerned with time. That ''Dasein'' is thrown into an already existing world and thus into its mortal possibilities does not only mean that ''Dasein'' is an essentially temporal being; it also implies that the description of ''Dasein'' can only be carried out in terms inherited from the Western tradition itself. For Heidegger, unlike for Husserl, philosophical terminology could not be divorced from the history of the use of that terminology, and thus genuine philosophy could not avoid confronting questions of language and meaning. The existential analytic of ''Being and Time'' was thus always only a first step in Heidegger's philosophy, to be followed by the \"dismantling\" (''Destruktion'') of the history of philosophy, that is, a transformation of its language and meaning, that would have made of the existential analytic only a kind of \"limit case\" (in the sense in which special relativity is a limit case of general relativity).<ref>Feh\u00e9r, M., Kiss, O., & Ropolyi, L., ''Hermeneutics and Science'' ([[Berlin]]/[[Heidelberg]]: [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]], 1999), [https://books.google.com/books?id=cBL8CAAAQBAJ&pg=PA216 p. 216].</ref>{{rp|216}}\n\nThat Heidegger did not write this second part of ''Being and Time'', and that the existential analytic was left behind in the course of Heidegger's subsequent writings on the history of being, might be interpreted as a failure to conjugate his account of ''individual'' experience with his account of the vicissitudes of the ''collective'' human adventure that he understands the Western philosophical tradition to be. And this would in turn raise the question of whether this failure is due to a flaw in Heidegger's account of temporality, that is, of whether Heidegger was correct to oppose vulgar and authentic time.<ref>Cf.

For example, in 2011 [[Mark Wrathall]]<ref>Wrathall, Mark:  Heidegger and Unconcealment: Truth, Language, and History, Cambridge University Press, 2011</ref> argued that Heidegger pursued and refined the central notion of unconcealment throughout his life as a philosopher. Its importance and continuity in his thinking, Wrathall states, shows that he did not have a \"turn\". A reviewer of Wrathall's book stated: \"An ontology of unconcealment [...] means a description and analysis of the broad contexts in which entities show up as meaningful to us, as well as the conditions under which such contexts, or worlds, emerge and fade.\"<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://ndpr.nd.edu/news/heidegger-and-unconcealment-truth-language-and-history/|title=Review of Heidegger and Unconcealment: Truth, Language, and History|first=Stephan|last=K\u00e4ufer|date=2 July 2011|via=Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews}}</ref>\n\nHeidegger focuses less on the way in which the structures of being are revealed in everyday behavior, and more on the way in which behavior itself depends on a prior \"openness to being.\" The essence of being human is the maintenance of this openness. This \u2018openness to being' can be seen as a basic ability of humans. We experience the world of beings as containing things in which we have an interest or concern.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Wheeler |first1=Michael |title=Martin Heidegger |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2018/entries/heidegger/>. |website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher=Stanford University |accessdate=10 December 2019}}</ref> Heidegger contrasts this openness to the \"will to power\" of the modern human subject, which is one way of forgetting this originary openness.\n\nHeidegger understands the commencement of the history of Western philosophy as a brief period of authentic openness to being, during the time of the [[Pre-Socratic philosophy|pre-Socratics]], especially [[Anaximander]], [[Heraclitus]], and [[Parmenides]]. This was followed, according to Heidegger, by a long period increasingly dominated by the forgetting of this initial openness, a period which commences with [[Plato]], and which occurs in different ways throughout Western history.\n\nTwo recurring themes of Heidegger's later writings are poetry and technology. Heidegger sees poetry and technology as two contrasting ways of \"[[world disclosure|revealing]].\" Poetry reveals being in the way in which, if it is genuine poetry, it commences something new. Technology, on the other hand, when it gets going, inaugurates the world of the dichotomous subject and object, which modern philosophy commencing with Descartes also reveals. But with ''modern'' technology a new stage of revealing is reached, in which the subject-object distinction is overcome even in the \"material\" world of technology. The essence of modern technology is the conversion of the whole universe of beings into an undifferentiated \"standing reserve\" (''Bestand'') of energy available for any use to which humans choose to put it. Heidegger described the essence of modern technology as ''[[Gestell]]'', or \"enframing.\" He does not unequivocally condemn technology: while he acknowledges that modern technology contains grave dangers, Heidegger nevertheless also argues that it may constitute a chance for human beings to enter a new epoch in their relation to being.<ref>For new directions in thinking about Heidegger\u2019s reflections on the essence of modern technology in the context of 21st century considerations of spatiality and the human body against the unfolding of cybernetics, robotics, AI, see: [[Nader El-Bizri]], \u2018Phenomenology of Place and Space in our Epoch: Thinking along Heideggerian Pathways\u2019, in The Phenomenology of Real and Virtual Places, ed.

Heidegger was substantially influenced by [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine of Hippo]] and that ''Being and Time'' would not have been possible without the influence of Augustine's thought. Augustine's  ''[[Confessions (St. Augustine)|Confessions]]'' was particularly influential in shaping Heidegger's thought.<ref>See ''The Influence of Augustine on Heidegger: The Emergence of an Augustinian Phenomenology'', ed. Craig J. N. de Paulo (Lewiston: The Edwin Mellen Press, 2006.) and also ''Martin Heidegger's Interpretations of Augustine: Sein und Zeit und Ewigkeit'', ed. Frederick Van Fleteren (Lewiston: The Edwin Mellen Press, 2005.)</ref>\n\nAugustine viewed time as relative and subjective, and that being and time were bound up together.<ref>Augustine of Hippo (2008). ''Confessions''. Chadwick, Henry transl.

Although he later worked less on Aristotle, Heidegger recommended postponing reading Nietzsche, and to \"first study Aristotle for ten to fifteen years\".<ref>Heidegger, ''[[What is Called Thinking?]]'' (New York: Harper & Row, 1968), p. 73.</ref> In reading Aristotle, Heidegger increasingly contested the traditional Latin translation and scholastic interpretation of his thought. Particularly important (not least for its influence upon others, both in their interpretation of Aristotle and in rehabilitating a neo-Aristotelian \"practical philosophy\")<ref>Kelvin Knight, ''Aristotelian Philosophy: Ethics and Politics from Aristotle to MacIntyre'' (Cambridge: Polity Press, 2007). {{pages needed|date=March 2018}}</ref> was his radical reinterpretation of Book Six of Aristotle's ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'' and several books of the ''[[Metaphysics (Aristotle)|Metaphysics]]''.

Heidegger claimed to have revived the question of being, the question having been largely forgotten by the [[Metaphysics|metaphysical]] tradition extending from [[Plato]] to [[Descartes]], a forgetfulness extending to the [[Age of Enlightenment]] and then to modern science and technology. In pursuit of the retrieval of this question, Heidegger spent considerable time reflecting on [[Greek philosophy|ancient Greek thought]], in particular on Plato, [[Parmenides]], [[Heraclitus]], and Anaximander, as well as on the tragic playwright [[Sophocles]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://web.alfredstate.edu/library/Antigone/Antigone.The%20Ode%20on%20Man.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120611205518/http://web.alfredstate.edu/library/Antigone/Antigone.The%20Ode%20on%20Man.pdf|url-status=dead|title=The Ode on Man in Sophocles' Antigone|archivedate=June 11, 2012}}</ref>\n\n====Dilthey====\n[[File:Wilhelm Dilthey zZ seiner Verlobung.jpg|thumb|140px|Wilhelm Dilthey, the young Heidegger was influenced by Dilthey's works]]\nHeidegger's very early project of developing a \"hermeneutics of [[Facticity|factical]] life\" and his hermeneutical transformation of phenomenology was influenced in part by his reading of the works of [[Wilhelm Dilthey]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=ROCKMORE|first=Tom|year=2003|jstor=23955847|journal=Revue Internationale de Philosophie|volume=57|issue=226 (4)|pages=477\u2013494|title=Dilthey and Historical Reason}}</ref>\n\nOf the influence of Dilthey, [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]] writes the following: \"As far as Dilthey is concerned, we all know today what I have known for a long time: namely that it is a mistake to conclude on the basis of the citation in ''Being and Time'' that Dilthey was especially influential in the development of Heidegger's thinking in the mid-1920s. This dating of the influence is much too late.\" He adds that by the fall of 1923 it was plain that Heidegger felt \"the clear superiority of [[Paul Yorck von Wartenburg|Count Yorck]] over the famous scholar, Dilthey.\" Gadamer nevertheless makes clear that Dilthey's influence was important in helping the youthful Heidegger \"in distancing himself from the systematic ideal of Neo-Kantianism, as Heidegger acknowledges in ''Being and Time''.\"<ref>Hans-Georg Gadamer, \"Martin Heidegger's One Path\", in Theodore Kisiel & John van Buren (eds.), ''Reading Heidegger from the Start: Essays in His Earliest Thought'' (Albany: SUNY Press, 1994), pp. 22\u20134.</ref> Based on Heidegger's earliest lecture courses, in which Heidegger already engages Dilthey's thought prior to the period Gadamer mentions as \"too late\", scholars as diverse as [[Theodore Kisiel]] and [[David Farrell Krell]] have argued for the importance of Diltheyan concepts and strategies in the formation of Heidegger's thought.<ref>In ''The Genesis of Heidegger's Being and Time'' (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1993), Theodor Kisiel designates the first version of the project that culminates in ''Being and Time'', \"the Dilthey draft\" ([https://books.google.com/books?id=5HzJuF-69xQC&lpg=PP1&hl=de&pg=PA313 p. 313]). David Farrell Krell comments in ''Daimon Life: Heidegger and Life-Philosophy'' (Bloomington & Indianapolis: Indiana University Press, 1992) that \"Heidegger's project sprouts (in part, but in ''good'' part) from the soil of Dilthey's philosophy of factical-historical life\" (p. 35).</ref>\n\nEven though Gadamer's interpretation of Heidegger has been questioned, there is little doubt that Heidegger seized upon Dilthey's concept of hermeneutics. Heidegger's novel ideas about ontology required a ''gestalt'' formation, not merely a series of logical arguments, in order to demonstrate his fundamentally new paradigm of thinking, and the [[hermeneutic circle]] offered a new and powerful tool for the articulation and realization of these ideas.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Nelson|first1=Eric S.|title=\"Heidegger and Dilthey: Language, History, and Hermeneutics\", in Horizons of Authenticity in Phenomenology, Existentialism, and Moral Psychology, edited by Hans Pedersen and Megan Altman|date=2014|publisher=Springer|location=Dordrecht|isbn=978-9401794411|pages=109\u201328}}</ref>\n\n====Husserl====\n[[File:Edmund Husserl 1910s.jpg|thumb|140px|Edmund Husserl, the man who established the school of phenomenology]]\nThere is disagreement over the degree of influence that [[Edmund Husserl]] had on Heidegger's philosophical development, just as there is disagreement about the degree to which Heidegger's philosophy is grounded in [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]]. These disagreements centre upon how much of Husserlian phenomenology is contested by Heidegger, and how much this phenomenology in fact informs Heidegger's own understanding.\n\nOn the relation between the two figures, Gadamer wrote: \"When asked about phenomenology, Husserl was quite right to answer as he used to in the period directly after World War I: 'Phenomenology, that is me and Heidegger'.\" Nevertheless, Gadamer noted that Heidegger was no patient collaborator with Husserl, and that Heidegger's \"rash ascent to the top, the incomparable fascination he aroused, and his stormy temperament surely must have made Husserl, the patient one, as suspicious of Heidegger as he always had been of [[Max Scheler]]'s volcanic fire.\"<ref>Hans-Georg Gadamer, \"Martin Heidegger\u201475 Years\", ''Heidegger's Ways'' (Albany: SUNY Press, 1994), p. 18.</ref>\n\nRobert J. Dostal understood the importance of Husserl to be profound:\n<blockquote>Heidegger himself, who is supposed to have broken with Husserl, bases his hermeneutics on an account of time that not only parallels Husserl's account in many ways but seems to have been arrived at through the same phenomenological method as was used by Husserl.... The differences between Husserl and Heidegger are significant, but if we do not see how much it is the case that Husserlian phenomenology provides the framework for Heidegger's approach, we will not be able to appreciate the exact nature of Heidegger's project in ''Being and Time'' or why he left it unfinished.<ref>Robert J. Dostal, \"Time and Phenomenology in Husserl and Heidegger\", in Charles Guignon (ed.), ''The Cambridge Companion to Heidegger'' (Cambridge & New York: Cambridge University Press, 1993), p. 142.</ref></blockquote>\n\nDaniel O. Dahlstrom saw Heidegger's presentation of his work as a departure from Husserl as unfairly misrepresenting Husserl's own work. Dahlstrom concluded his consideration of the relation between Heidegger and Husserl as follows:\n\n<blockquote>Heidegger's silence about the stark similarities between his account of temporality and Husserl's investigation of internal time-consciousness contributes to a ''misrepresentation'' of Husserl's account of intentionality. Contrary to the criticisms Heidegger advances in his lectures, intentionality (and, by implication, the meaning of 'to be') in the final analysis is not construed by Husserl as sheer presence (be it the presence of a fact or object, act or event). Yet for all its \"dangerous closeness\" to what Heidegger understands by temporality, Husserl's account of internal time-consciousness does differ fundamentally. In Husserl's account the structure of protentions is accorded neither the finitude nor the primacy that Heidegger claims are central to the original future of ecstatic-horizonal temporality.<ref>Daniel O. Dahlstrom, \"Heidegger's Critique of Husserl\", in Theodore Kisiel & John van Buren (eds.), ''Reading Heidegger from the Start: Essays in His Earliest Thought'' (Albany: SUNY Press, 1994), p. 244.</ref></blockquote>\n\n====Kierkegaard====\n[[File:S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard (1813-1855) - (cropped).jpg|thumb|140px|S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard, considered to be the first existential philosopher]]\nHeideggerians regarded [[S\u00f8ren Kierkegaard]] as, by far, the greatest philosophical contributor to Heidegger's own existentialist concepts.<ref>Dreyfus, Hubert.

The lectures on Nietzsche focused on fragments posthumously published under the title ''[[The Will to Power (manuscript)|The Will to Power]]'', rather than on Nietzsche's published works. Heidegger read ''The Will to Power'' as the culminating expression of Western metaphysics, and the lectures are a kind of dialogue between the two thinkers.\n\nThe fundamental differences between the philosophical delineations of Heidegger and [[Adorno]] can be found in their contrasting views of H\u00f6lderlin's poetical works and to a lesser extent in their divergent views on [[German romanticism]] in general. For Heidegger, H\u00f6lderlin expressed the intuitive necessity of metaphysical concepts as a guide for ethical paradigms, devoid of reflection. Adorno, on the other hand, pointed to the dialectic reflection of historical situations, the sociological interpretations of future outcomes, and therefore opposed the liberating principles of intuitive concepts because they negatively surpassed the perception of societal realities.<ref>Oliver Garbrecht (1999).

Heidegger grants to H\u00f6lderlin a singular place within the history of being and the history of Germany, as a herald whose thought is yet to be \"heard\" in Germany or the West. Many of Heidegger's works from the 1930s onwards include meditations on lines from H\u00f6lderlin's poetry, and several of the lecture courses are devoted to the reading of a single poem (see, for example, ''[[H\u00f6lderlin's Hymn \"The Ister\"]]'').\n\n===Heidegger and Eastern thought===\nSome writers on Heidegger's work see possibilities within it for dialogue with traditions of thought outside of Western philosophy, particularly East Asian thinking.<ref>Ma, L., [https://books.google.com/books?id=2kyTAgAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover ''Heidegger on East-West Dialogue: Anticipating the Event''] (New York / London: [[Routledge]], 2008).</ref><ref>[[Harry Oldmeadow|Oldmeadow, H.]], ''Journeys East: 20th Century Western Encounters with Eastern Religious Traditions'' ([[Bloomington, Indiana|Bloomington]]: [[World Wisdom]], 2004), [https://books.google.com/books?id=vC1qAj6RbRQC&pg=PA351 pp. 351\u2013354].</ref>{{rp|351\u2013354}} Despite perceived differences between Eastern and Western philosophy, some of Heidegger's later work, particularly \"A Dialogue on Language between a Japanese and an Inquirer\", does show an interest in initiating such a dialogue.<ref>Heidegger, \"A Dialogue on Language between a Japanese and an Inquirer\", in ''On the Way to Language'' (New York: Harper & Row, 1971).</ref> Heidegger himself had contact with a number of leading Japanese intellectuals, including members of the [[Kyoto School]], notably [[Hajime Tanabe]] and [[Kuki Sh\u016bz\u014d]].

He asserts: \"The investigation concludes that Heidegger\u2019s work was significantly influenced by East Asian sources. It can be shown, moreover, that in particular instances Heidegger even appropriated wholesale and almost verbatim major ideas from the German translations of Daoist and Zen Buddhist classics. This clandestine textual appropriation of non-Western spirituality, the extent of which has gone undiscovered for so long, seems quite unparalleled, with far-reaching implications for our future interpretation of Heidegger\u2019s work.\"<ref>''Heidegger's hidden sources: East Asian influences on his work'' by Reinhard May, p.

It will in no way be denied that at the time I believed in such possibilities and for that reason renounced the actual vocation of thinking in favor of being effective in an official capacity.

Heidegger's predecessor as Rector formally notified Husserl of his \"enforced leave of absence\" on 14 April 1933.\n\nHeidegger became Rector of the University of Freiburg on 22 April 1933. The following week the national Reich law of 28 April 1933 replaced Reichskommissar Wagner's decree.  The Reich law required the firing of Jewish professors from German universities, including those, such as Husserl, who had converted to Christianity. The termination of the retired professor Husserl's academic privileges thus did not involve any specific action on Heidegger's part.<ref>[http://www.bostonreview.net/BR24.5/benhabib.html#5 Seyla Benhabib, ''The Personal is not the Political''] (October/November 1999 issue of Boston Review.)</ref>\n\nHeidegger had by then broken off contact with Husserl, other than through intermediaries.  Heidegger later claimed that his relationship with Husserl had already become strained after Husserl publicly \"settled accounts\" with Heidegger and [[Max Scheler]] in the early 1930s.<ref>Martin Heidegger, \"Der Spiegel Interview\", in G\u00fcnther Neske & Emil Kettering (eds.), ''Martin Heidegger and National Socialism: Questions and Answers'' (New York: Paragon House, 1990), p. 48.</ref>\n\nHeidegger did not attend his former mentor's cremation in 1938. In 1941, under pressure from publisher Max Niemeyer, Heidegger agreed to remove the dedication to Husserl from ''Being and Time'' (restored in post-war editions).<ref>R\u00fcdiger Safranski, ''Martin Heidegger: Between Good and Evil'' (Cambridge, Mass., & London: Harvard University Press, 1998), pp. 253\u20138.</ref>\n\nHeidegger's behavior towards Husserl has evoked controversy. Arendt initially suggested that Heidegger's behavior precipitated Husserl's death. She called Heidegger a \"potential murderer.\" However, she later recanted her accusation.<ref>[[Elzbieta Ettinger]],''Hannah Arendt \u2013 Martin Heidegger'', (New Haven, Conn., & London: Yale University Press, 1995), p. 37.</ref>\n\nIn 1939, only a year after Husserl's death, Heidegger wrote in his ''[[Black Notebooks]]'': \"The more original and inceptive the coming decisions and questions become, the more inaccessible will they remain to this [Jewish] 'race'. Thus, Husserl\u2019s step toward phenomenological observation, and his rejection of psychological explanations and historiological reckoning of opinions, are of enduring importance\u2014yet it never reaches into the domains of essential decisions\",<ref>GA 96: 46-47 (from \u00dcberlegungen XII, 24) (1939?)</ref> seeming to imply that Husserl's philosophy was limited purely because he was Jewish.\n\n===Post-rectorate period===\nAfter the failure of Heidegger's rectorship, he withdrew from most political activity, but remained a member of the [[Nazi Party]].\n\nIn a 1935 lecture, later published in 1953 as part of the book ''[[Introduction to Metaphysics (Heidegger)|Introduction to Metaphysics]]'', Heidegger refers to the \"inner truth and greatness\" of the National Socialist movement (''die innere Wahrheit und Gr\u00f6\u00dfe dieser Bewegung''), but he then adds a qualifying statement in parentheses: \"namely, the confrontation of planetary technology and modern humanity\" (''n\u00e4mlich die Begegnung der planetarisch bestimmten Technik und des neuzeitlichen Menschen''). However, it subsequently transpired that this qualification had not been made during the original lecture, although Heidegger claimed that it had been. This has led scholars to argue that Heidegger still supported the Nazi party in 1935 but that he did not want to admit this after the war, and so he attempted to silently correct his earlier statement.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Habermas | first1 = J\u00fcrgen | authorlink = J\u00fcrgen Habermas | year = 1989 | title = Work and ''Weltanschauung'': the Heidegger Controversy from a German Perspective | url = | journal = [[Critical Inquiry]] | volume = 15 | issue = 2| pages = 452\u201354 | doi = 10.1086/448492 }} See also [[J.

For instance, in a 1942 lecture, published posthumously, Heidegger said of recent German classics scholarship:\n\n<blockquote>In the majority of \"research results,\" the Greeks appear as pure National Socialists. This overenthusiasm on the part of academics seems not even to notice that with such \"results\" it does National Socialism and its historical uniqueness no service at all, not that it needs this anyhow.<ref>Heidegger, ''[[H\u00f6lderlin's Hymn \"The Ister\"]]'' (Bloomington & Indianapolis: [[Indiana University Press]], 1996), [https://books.google.com/books?id=zINZfjUWXoEC&lpg=PP1&pg=PA79 pp. 79\u201380].</ref></blockquote>\n\nAn important witness to Heidegger's continued allegiance to National Socialism during the post-rectorship period is his former student [[Karl L\u00f6with]], who met Heidegger in 1936 while Heidegger was visiting Rome. In an account set down in 1940 (though not intended for publication), L\u00f6with recalled that Heidegger wore a swastika pin to their meeting, though Heidegger knew that L\u00f6with was Jewish. L\u00f6with also recalled that Heidegger \"left no doubt about his faith in [[Hitler]]\", and stated that his support for National Socialism was in agreement with the essence of his philosophy.<ref>Karl L\u00f6with, \"My last meeting with Heidegger in Rome\", in R.

Heidegger's former lover [[Hannah Arendt|Arendt]] spoke on his behalf at this hearing, while [[Karl Jaspers|Jaspers]] spoke against him. He was charged on four counts, dismissed from the university and declared a \"follower\" (''[[Mitl\u00e4ufer]]'') of Nazism.<ref name=\"Thomas Sheehan\"/> Heidegger was forbidden to teach between 1945 and 1951. One consequence of this teaching ban was that Heidegger began to engage far more in the French philosophical scene.<ref>[[Dominique Janicaud]], ''Heidegger en France'' vol. 1 (Paris: Albin Michel, 2001).</ref>\n\nIn his postwar thinking, Heidegger distanced himself from Nazism, but his critical comments about Nazism seem \"scandalous\" to some since they tend to equate the Nazi war atrocities with other inhumane practices related to [[Rationalization (sociology)|rationalisation]] and [[industrialisation]], including the treatment of animals by [[factory farming]]. For instance in a lecture delivered at Bremen in 1949, Heidegger said: \"Agriculture is now a motorized food industry, the same thing in its essence as the production of corpses in the gas chambers and the extermination camps, the same thing as blockades and the reduction of countries to famine, the same thing as the manufacture of hydrogen bombs.\"<ref name=\"Thomas Sheehan\"/>\n\nIn 1967 Heidegger met with the Jewish poet [[Paul Celan]], a concentration camp survivor. Celan visited Heidegger at his country retreat and wrote an enigmatic poem about the meeting, which some interpret as Celan's wish for Heidegger to apologize for his behavior during the Nazi era.<ref>{{Cite journal\n| doi = 10.2307/488241\n| issn = 0094-033X\n| issue = 53\n| pages = 3\u201318\n| last = Anderson\n| first = Mark M.\n| title = The \"Impossibility of Poetry\": Celan and Heidegger in France\n| journal = New German Critique\n| date = 1991-04-01\n| jstor=488241\n}}</ref>\n\n===''Der Spiegel'' interview===\nOn 23 September 1966, Heidegger was interviewed by [[Rudolf Augstein]] and [[Georg Wolff (journalist)|Georg Wolff]] for ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' magazine, in which he agreed to discuss his political past provided that the interview be published posthumously.

Second, he admitted that he saw an \"awakening\" (''Aufbruch'') which might help to find a \"new national and social approach,\" but said that he changed his mind about this in 1934, largely prompted by the violence of the [[Night of the Long Knives]].\n\nIn his interview Heidegger defended as [[double-speak]] his 1935 lecture describing the \"inner truth and greatness of this movement.\" He affirmed that Nazi informants who observed his lectures would understand that by \"movement\" he meant National Socialism. However, Heidegger asserted that his dedicated students would know this statement was no eulogy for the [[Nazi Party]]. Rather, he meant it as he expressed it in the parenthetical clarification later added to ''Introduction to Metaphysics'' (1953), namely, \"the confrontation of planetary technology and modern humanity.\"\n\nThe eyewitness account of L\u00f6with from 1940 contradicts the account given in the ''Der Spiegel'' interview in two ways: that he did not make any decisive break with National Socialism in 1934, and that Heidegger was willing to entertain more profound relations between his philosophy and political involvement. The ''Der Spiegel'' interviewers did not bring up Heidegger's 1949 quotation comparing the industrialization of agriculture to the extermination camps.

He influenced [[Jean Beaufret]], [[:fr:Fran\u00e7ois F\u00e9dier|Fran\u00e7ois F\u00e9dier]], [[Dominique Janicaud]], [[Jean-Luc Marion]], [[:fr:Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Courtine|Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Courtine]] and others.\n\n===Existentialism and pre-war influence===\nHeidegger's influence on French philosophy began in the 1930s, when ''Being and Time'', \"What is Metaphysics?\" and other Heideggerian texts were read by Jean-Paul Sartre and other existentialists, as well as by thinkers such as [[Alexandre Koj\u00e8ve]], [[Georges Bataille]] and [[Emmanuel Levinas]].<ref>On the history of the French translation of Heidegger's \"What is Metaphysics?\", and on its importance to the French intellectual scene, cf. Denis Hollier, \"Plenty of Nothing\", in Hollier (ed.), ''A New History of French Literature'' (Cambridge, Massachusetts, Harvard University Press, 1989), pp. 894\u2013900.</ref> Because Heidegger's discussion of ontology (the study of being) is rooted in an analysis of the mode of existence of individual human beings (''Da-sein'', or there-being), his work has often been associated with existentialism. The influence of Heidegger on Sartre's ''[[Being and Nothingness]]'' (1943) is marked, but Heidegger felt that Sartre had misread his work, as he argued in later texts such as the \"[[Letter on Humanism]]\". In that text, intended for a French audience, Heidegger explained this misreading in the following terms:\n\n<blockquote>Sartre's key proposition about the priority of ''existentia'' over ''essentia''  [that is, Sartre's statement that \"existence precedes essence\"] does, however, justify using the name \"existentialism\" as an appropriate title for a philosophy of this sort. But the basic tenet of \"existentialism\" has nothing at all in common with the statement from ''Being and Time'' [that \"the 'essence' of Dasein lies in its existence\"]\u2014apart from the fact that in ''Being and Time'' no statement about the relation of ''essentia'' and ''existentia'' can yet be expressed, since there it is still a question of preparing something precursory.<ref>Heidegger, \"Letter on Humanism\". ''Pathmarks'' (Cambridge & New York: Cambridge University Press, 1998), pp. 250\u20131.</ref></blockquote>\n\n\"Letter on 'Humanism'\" is often seen as a direct response to Sartre's 1945 lecture \"[[Existentialism Is a Humanism]]\". Aside from merely disputing readings of his own work, however, in the \"Letter on Humanism\" Heidegger asserts that \"Every humanism is either grounded in a metaphysics or is itself made to be the ground of one.\"  Heidegger's largest issue with Sartre's existential humanism is that, while it does make a humanistic 'move' in privileging existence over essence, \"the reversal of a metaphysical statement remains a metaphysical statement.\" From this point onward in his thought, Heidegger attempted to think beyond metaphysics to a place where the articulation of the fundamental questions of ontology were fundamentally possible: only from this point can we restore (that is, re-give [redonner]) any possible meaning to the word \"humanism\".\n\n===Post-war forays into France===\nAfter the war, Heidegger was banned from university teaching for a period on account of his support of Nazism while serving as Rector of Freiburg University.<ref>{{cite book | last = Ott | first = Hugo | title = Martin Heidegger : a political life | publisher = HarperCollinsPublishers BasicBooks | location = Hammersmith, London New York, N.Y | year = 1993 | page = 214ff | isbn = 0465028985 }}</ref> He developed a number of contacts in France, where his work continued to be taught, and a number of French students visited him at [[Todtnauberg]] (see, for example, [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Lyotard]]'s brief account in ''Heidegger and \"the Jews\"'', which discusses a Franco-German conference held in Freiburg in 1947, one step toward bringing together French and German students).{{Citation needed|reason=I was unable to track down a source for this.|date=July 2019}} Heidegger subsequently made several visits to France, and made efforts to keep abreast of developments in French philosophy by way of correspondence with [[Jean Beaufret]], an early French translator of Heidegger, and with Lucien Braun.\n\n===Derrida and deconstruction===\n[[Deconstruction]] came to Heidegger's attention in 1967 by way of Lucien Braun's recommendation of [[Jacques Derrida]]'s work ([[Hans-Georg Gadamer]] was present at an initial discussion and indicated to Heidegger that Derrida's work came to his attention by way of an assistant). Heidegger expressed interest in meeting Derrida personally after the latter sent him some of his work. There was discussion of a meeting in 1972, but this failed to take place.<ref>Krell, David Farrell. \"Troubled Brows: Heidegger\u2019s Black Notebooks, 1942\u20131948.\" Research in Phenomenology 46, no. 2 (2016): 309-335.</ref> Heidegger's interest in Derrida is said by Braun to have been considerable (as is evident in two letters, of September 29, 1967 and May 16, 1972, from Heidegger to Braun). Braun also brought to Heidegger's attention the work of [[Michel Foucault]]. Foucault's relation to Heidegger is a matter of considerable difficulty; Foucault acknowledged Heidegger as a philosopher whom he read but never wrote about. (For more on this see ''Penser \u00e0 Strasbourg,'' Jacques Derrida, et al., which includes reproductions of both letters and an account by Braun, \"\u00c0 mi-chemin entre Heidegger et Derrida\").\n\nDerrida attempted to displace the understanding of Heidegger's work that had been prevalent in France from the period of the ban against Heidegger teaching in German universities, which amounted to an almost wholesale rejection of the influence of [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] and existentialist terms. In Derrida's view, deconstruction is a tradition inherited via Heidegger (the French term \"d\u00e9construction\" is a term coined to translate Heidegger's use of the words \"Destruktion\"\u2014literally \"destruction\"\u2014and \"Abbau\"\u2014more literally \"de-building\"). According to Derrida, Sartre's interpretation of Dasein and other key Heideggerian concerns is overly psychologistic, anthropocentric, and misses the historicality central to ''Dasein'' in ''Being and Time''.\n\n===The Far\u00edas debate===\n[[Jacques Derrida]], [[Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe]], and [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Lyotard]], among others, all engaged in debate and disagreement about the relation between Heidegger's philosophy and his Nazi politics. These debates included the question of whether it was possible to do without Heidegger's philosophy, a position which Derrida in particular rejected. Forums where these debates took place include the proceedings of the first conference dedicated to Derrida's work, published as \"Les Fins de l'homme \u00e0 partir du travail de Jacques Derrida: colloque de Cerisy, 23 juillet-2 ao\u00fbt 1980\", Derrida's \"Feu la cendre/cio' che resta del fuoco\", and the studies on [[Paul Celan]] by Lacoue-Labarthe and Derrida which shortly preceded the detailed studies of Heidegger's politics published in and after 1987.\n\nWhen in 1987 [[V\u00edctor Far\u00edas]] published his book ''Heidegger et le nazisme'', this debate was taken up by many others, some of whom were inclined to disparage so-called \"deconstructionists\" for their association with Heidegger's philosophy. Derrida and others not only continued to defend the importance of reading Heidegger, but attacked Far\u00edas on the grounds of poor scholarship and for what they saw as the sensationalism of his approach. Not all scholars agreed with this negative assessment: [[Richard Rorty]], for example, declared that \"[Far\u00edas'] book includes more concrete information relevant to Heidegger's relations with the Nazis than anything else available, and it is an excellent antidote to the evasive apologetics that are still being published.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.temple.edu/tempress/titles/618_reg_print.html|title=Richard Rorty, review of ''Heidegger and Nazism'' in the New Republic, quoted on the Temple University Press promotional page for ''Heidegger and Nazism''}}</ref>\n\n===Bernard Stiegler===\nMore recently, Heidegger's thought has influenced the work of the French philosopher [[Bernard Stiegler]]. This is evident even from the title of Stiegler's multi-volume ''magnum opus'', ''La technique et le temps'' (volume one translated into English as ''[[Technics and Time, 1|Technics and Time, 1: The Fault of Epimetheus]]'').<ref>Bernard Stiegler,'' Technics and Time, 1: The Fault of Epimetheus'' (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1998), part 2.</ref> Stiegler offers an original reading of Heidegger, arguing that there can be no access to \"originary temporality\" other than via material, that is, technical, supports, and that Heidegger recognised this in the form of his account of world historicality, yet in the end suppressed that fact. Stiegler understands the existential analytic of ''Being and Time'' as an account of psychic [[individuation]], and his later \"history of being\" as an account of collective individuation. He understands many of the problems of Heidegger's philosophy and politics as the consequence of Heidegger's inability to integrate the two.\n\n===Giorgio Agamben===\nHeidegger has been very influential on the work of the Italian philosopher [[Giorgio Agamben]]. Agamben attended seminars in France led by Heidegger in the late 1960s.<ref>Durantaye, Leland de la. (2009). Giorgio Agamben. A Critical Introduction. Stanford: Stanford University Press.</ref>\n\n==Criticism==\nHeidegger's influence upon 20th century [[continental philosophy]] is unquestioned and has produced a variety of critical responses.{{Citation needed|reason=Unquestioned?|date=July 2019}}\n\n===Early criticisms===\nAccording to Husserl, ''Being and Time'' claimed to deal with ontology but only did so in the first few pages of the book. Having nothing further to contribute to an ontology independent of human existence, Heidegger changed the topic to ''Dasein''. Whereas Heidegger argued that the question of human existence is central to the pursuit of the question of being, Husserl criticized this as reducing phenomenology to \"philosophical anthropology\" and offering an abstract and incorrect portrait of the human being.<ref>See Edmund Husserl, ''Psychological and transcendental phenomenology and the confrontation with Heidegger (1927\u20131931)'' (Dordrecht: Kluwer, 1997).</ref>\n\nThe [[Neo-Kantian]] [[Ernst Cassirer]] and Heidegger engaged in an influential debate located in [[Davos]] in 1929, concerning the significance of Kantian notions of freedom and rationality (see [[Cassirer\u2013Heidegger debate]]). Whereas Cassirer defended the role of rationality in [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], Heidegger argued for the priority of the imagination.\n\nDilthey's student [[Georg Misch]] wrote the first extended critical appropriation of Heidegger in ''Lebensphilosophie und Ph\u00e4nomenologie. Eine Auseinandersetzung der Diltheyschen Richtung mit Heidegger und Husserl'', Leipzig 1930 (3rd ed. Stuttgart 1964).\n\n===The [[Young Hegelian]]s and critical theory===\n[[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]]-influenced Marxist thinkers, especially [[Gy\u00f6rgy Luk\u00e1cs]] and the [[Frankfurt School]], associated the style and content of Heidegger's thought with German irrationalism and criticized its political implications.<ref>[[Tom Rockmore|Rockmore, T.]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=feWlC4ioGTYC&printsec=frontcover ''On Heidegger's Nazism and Philosophy''] (Berkeley, Los Angeles, London: [[University of California Press]], 1992), pp. 57, 75, 149, 258.</ref>\n\nInitially members of the Frankfurt School were positively disposed to Heidegger, becoming more critical at the beginning of the 1930s. Heidegger's student Herbert Marcuse became associated with the Frankfurt School. Initially striving for a synthesis between Hegelian Marxism and Heidegger's phenomenology, Marcuse later rejected Heidegger's thought for its \"false concreteness\" and \"revolutionary conservativism.\" [[Theodor Adorno]] wrote an extended critique of the ideological character of Heidegger's early and later use of language in the ''Jargon of Authenticity''. Contemporary social theorists associated with the Frankfurt School have remained largely critical of Heidegger's works and influence. In particular, [[J\u00fcrgen Habermas]] admonishes the influence of Heidegger on recent French philosophy in his polemic against \"postmodernism\" in ''[[The Philosophical Discourse of Modernity]]'' (1985). However, work by philosopher and critical theorist [[Nikolas Kompridis]] tries to show that Heidegger's insights into [[world disclosure]] are badly misunderstood and mishandled by Habermas, and are of vital importance for critical theory, offering an important way of [[reflective disclosure|renewing that tradition]].<ref>Nikolas Kompridis, ''Critique and Disclosure: Critical Theory between Past and Future'' MIT Press, 2006.{{page needed|date=April 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/09672550500169125 |title=Disclosing Possibility: The Past and Future of Critical Theory1 |journal=International Journal of Philosophical Studies |volume=13 |issue=3 |pages=325\u201351 |year=2005 |last1=Kompridis |first1=Nikolas }}</ref>\n\n===Reception by analytic and Anglo-American philosophy===\nCriticism of Heidegger's philosophy has also come from [[analytic philosophy]], beginning with [[logical positivism]]. In \"The Elimination of Metaphysics Through Logical Analysis of Language\" (1932), [[Rudolf Carnap]] accused Heidegger of offering an \"illusory\" ontology, criticizing him for committing the fallacy of [[Reification (fallacy)|reification]] and for wrongly dismissing the logical treatment of language which, according to Carnap, can only lead to writing \"nonsensical pseudo-propositions.\"\n\nThe British logical positivist [[A. J. Ayer]] was strongly critical of Heidegger's philosophy. In Ayer's view, Heidegger proposed vast, overarching theories regarding existence, which are completely unverifiable through empirical demonstration and logical analysis. For Ayer, this sort of philosophy was a poisonous strain in modern thought. He considered Heidegger to be the worst example of such philosophy, which Ayer believed to be entirely useless.\n\n[[Bertrand Russell]] considered Heidegger an [[obscurantist]], writing, \n<blockquote>Highly eccentric in its terminology, his philosophy is extremely obscure. One cannot help suspecting that language is here running riot. An interesting point in his speculations is the insistence that nothingness is something positive. As with much else in Existentialism, this is a psychological observation made to pass for logic.<ref>{{cite book|last = Russell|first = Bertrand|authorlink = Bertrand Russell|title = Wisdom of the West|publisher = Crescent Books|year = 1989|page = 303|isbn = 978-0-517-69041-3}}</ref></blockquote>\nThis quote expresses the sentiments of many 20th-century analytic philosophers concerning Heidegger.<ref>{{cite book|title=Heidegger: An Introduction|first=Richard|last=Polt|date=7 January 1999|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn = 978-0801485640}}</ref>\n\n[[Roger Scruton]] stated that:  \"His major work ''Being and Time'' is formidably difficult\u2014unless it is utter nonsense, in which case it is laughably easy. I am not sure how to judge it, and have read no commentator who even begins to make sense of it\".<ref>Jeff Collins, ''Introducing Heidegger'' (Thriplow, Cambridge: Icon Books, 1998), p. 7.</ref>\n\nThe analytic tradition values clarity of expression. Heidegger, however, has on occasion appeared to take an opposing view, stating for example:\n\n<blockquote>those in the crossing must in the end know what is mistaken by all urging for intelligibility: that every thinking of being, all philosophy, can ''never'' be confirmed by \"facts,\" i.e., by beings. Making itself intelligible is suicide for philosophy. Those who idolize \"facts\" never notice that their idols only shine in a borrowed light. They are also meant not to notice this; for thereupon they would have to be at a loss and therefore useless. But idolizers and idols are used wherever gods are in flight and so announce ''their'' nearness.<ref name=\"MartinHeidegger\">Martin Heidegger, ''Contributions to Philosophy (From Enowning)'' (Bloomington & Indianapolis: Indiana University Press, 1999), p. 307.</ref></blockquote>\n\nApart from the charge of [[obscurantism]], other analytic philosophers considered the actual content of Heidegger's work to be either faulty and meaningless, vapid or uninteresting. However, not all analytic philosophers have been as hostile. [[Gilbert Ryle]] wrote a critical yet positive review of ''Being and Time''. [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] made a remark recorded by [[Friedrich Waismann]]: \"To be sure, I can imagine what Heidegger means by being and anxiety\"<ref>''Wittgenstein and the Vienna Circle: Conversations Recorded by Friedrich Waismann'', Basil Blackwell, Oxford, 1979, p. 68</ref> which has been construed by some commentators<ref>James Luchte, \u2018Under the Aspect of Time (\"sub specie temporis\"): Heidegger, Wittgenstein, and the Place of the Nothing,\u2019 Philosophy Today, Volume 53, Number 2, 2009.</ref> as sympathetic to Heidegger's philosophical approach. These positive and negative analytic evaluations have been collected in Michael Murray (ed.), ''Heidegger and Modern Philosophy: Critical Essays'' (Yale University Press, 1978). Heidegger's reputation within English-language philosophy has slightly improved in philosophical terms in some part through the efforts of [[Hubert Dreyfus]], [[Richard Rorty]], and a recent generation of analytically oriented phenomenology scholars. Pragmatist Rorty claimed that Heidegger's approach to philosophy in the first half of his career has much in common with that of the latter-day Ludwig Wittgenstein. Nevertheless, Rorty asserted that what Heidegger had constructed in his writings was a myth of being rather than an account of it.<ref>Jeff Collins, ''Introducing Heidegger'' (Thriplow, Cambridge: Icon Books, 1998), p. 170.</ref>\n\n===Contemporary European reception===\nAlthough Heidegger is considered by many observers to be one of the most influential philosophers of the 20th century,<ref>{{cite book |last1=Honderich |first1=Ted |title=Oxford Companion to Philosophy |url=https://archive.org/details/oxfordcompaniont00hond |url-access=registration |date=1995 |publisher=Oxford |isbn=978-0-19-926479-7 |page=[https://archive.org/details/oxfordcompaniont00hond/page/375 375] |edition=Second}}</ref> aspects of his work have been criticised by those who nevertheless acknowledge this influence, such as [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]] and [[Jacques Derrida]]. Some questions raised about Heidegger's philosophy include the priority of ontology, the status of animals, the nature of the religious, Heidegger's supposed neglect of ethics (Levinas), the body ([[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]]), sexual difference ([[Luce Irigaray]]), or space ([[Peter Sloterdijk]]).<ref>Elden, S., ''Sloterdijk Now'' (Cambridge: [[Polity Press]], 2012), [https://books.google.cz/books?id=AU5_Vd-O4e4C&pg=PA85#v=onepage&q&f=false pp. 85\u201388].</ref>{{rp|85\u201388}}\n\nLevinas was deeply influenced by Heidegger, and yet became one of his fiercest critics, contrasting the infinity of the good beyond being with the immanence and totality of ontology. Levinas also condemned Heidegger's involvement with National Socialism, stating: \"One can forgive many Germans, but there are some Germans it is difficult to forgive. It is difficult to forgive Heidegger.\"<ref>Emmanuel Levinas, ''Nine Talmudic Readings'' (Indiana University Press, 1990), p. xxv, translated by Annette Aronowicz</ref>\n\nHeidegger's defenders, notably Arendt, see his support for Nazism as arguably a personal \" 'error' \" (a word which Arendt placed in quotation marks when referring to Heidegger's Nazi-era politics).<ref>Hannah Arendt, ''Martin Heidegger At 80'', New York Review of Books, 17/6, (Oct. 21, 1971), 50\u201354; repr. in ''Heidegger and Modern Philosophy'' ed.

For instance, when a hammer is used to knock in a nail, we do not attend to the hammer in itself but are aware of it only as a \"ready-to-hand\" extension of ourselves to achieve a future result: the knocking in of the nail. The past (the existing or \"given\" hammer) is reduced to a future usefulness (the driven nail). ''Zuhanden'' (readiness-to-hand), in which the distinction between subject and object is blurred, is one of three modes of Being that Heidegger identified \u2013 the others being ''Vorhanden'' (presence-at-hand), for things that are there but that we don't interact with, and ''Dasein'' (human existence).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://compendium.kosawese.net/term/present-at-hand-vorhanden-and-ready-to-hand-zuhanden/|title=Present-at-hand (Vorhanden) and Ready-to-hand (Zuhanden) &#124; MANE Compendium}}</ref>\n\nHeidegger claimed philosophy and science since ancient Greece had reduced things to their presence, which was a superficial way of understanding them. One crucial source of this insight was Heidegger's reading of [[Franz Brentano]]'s treatise on Aristotle's manifold uses of the word \"being\", a work which provoked Heidegger to ask what kind of unity underlies this multiplicity of uses. Heidegger opens his magnum opus, ''Being and Time'', with a citation from [[Plato]]'s ''[[Sophist (dialogue)|Sophist]]''<ref>For a study on Heidegger's reading of the ''Sophist'' and his less central interest in Plato's ''Timaeus'' and its conception of ''space'' qua ''kh\u00f4ra'': see: [[Nader El-Bizri]], \"''On kai kh\u00f4ra'': Situating Heidegger between the ''Sophist'' and the ''Timaeus''\", ''Studia Phaenomenologica'', Vol. IV, Issue 1\u20132 (2004), pp. 73\u201398.  This study is also closely connected with an investigation of Heidegger's later reflections on 'dwelling' as set in: [[Nader El-Bizri]], 'Being at Home Among Things: Heidegger\u2019s Reflections on Dwelling', Environment, Space, Place 3 (2011), pp. 47\u201371.  Refer also to other aspects of this research under the section of 'Heidegger and Eastern Thought', and also the influence on architectural thinking in the main body of the text above</ref> indicating that Western philosophy has neglected Being because it was considered too obvious to question. Heidegger's intuition about the question of Being is thus a historical argument, which in his later work becomes his concern with the \"history of Being\", that is, the history of the forgetting of Being, which according to Heidegger requires that philosophy retrace its footsteps through a productive [[Heideggerian terminology|destruction]] of the history of philosophy.<ref>[[Edward Craig (philosopher)|Craig, E.]], ed., ''The Shorter Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (London / New York: Routledge, 2005), [https://books.google.com/books?id=Z_Z-AgAAQBAJ&pg=PA363 p. 363].</ref>{{rp|363}}\n\nThe second intuition animating Heidegger's philosophy derives from the influence of Husserl, a philosopher largely uninterested in questions of philosophical history. Rather, Husserl argued that all that philosophy could and should be is a description of experience (hence the phenomenological slogan, \"to the things themselves\"). But for Heidegger, this meant understanding that experience is [[world disclosure|always already situated in a world]] and in ways of being. Thus Husserl's understanding that all consciousness is \"[[intentionality|intentional]]\" (in the sense that it is always intended ''toward'' something, and is always \"about\" something) is transformed in Heidegger's philosophy, becoming the thought that all experience is grounded in Sorge, which means the anxiety or worrifulness arising out of concern about the future\u2014referring to the inner state of being as well as external causality of that being. Heidegger also employs two cognates of Sorge; Besorgen - provision of something for oneself or someone else, and Fursorge - solicitude or caring for another in need of help. This thicket of meaning around care/concern (Sorge) is the basis of Heidegger's \"existential analytic\", as he develops it in ''Being and Time''.<ref>{{cite book | last = Inwood | first = M. J. | title = A Heidegger dictionary | publisher = Blackwell Publishers | location = Malden, Mass | year = 2000 | isbn = 9780631190943 }}</ref> Heidegger argues that describing experience properly entails finding the being for whom such a description might matter. Heidegger thus conducts his description of experience with reference to \"''[[Dasein]]''\", the being for whom Being is a question. In everyday German, \"''Dasein''\" means \"existence.\" It is composed of \"''Da''\" (here/there) and \"''Sein''\" (being). ''Dasein'' is transformed in Heidegger's usage from its everyday meaning to refer, rather, to that being that is ''there'' in its world, that is, the being for whom being matters. In later publications Heidegger writes the term in hyphenated form as ''Da-sein'', thus emphasizing the distance from the word's ordinary usage.<ref>Powell, J., ''Heidegger's Contributions to Philosophy: Life and the Last God'' (New York: [[Continuum International Publishing Group]], 2007), [https://books.google.com/books?id=45rUAwAAQBAJ&pg=PA137 p. 137].</ref>\n\nIn ''Being and Time'', Heidegger criticized the abstract and metaphysical character of traditional ways of grasping human existence as rational animal, person, man, soul, spirit, or subject. ''Dasein'', then, is not intended as a way of conducting a [[philosophical anthropology]], but is rather understood by Heidegger to be the condition of possibility for anything ''like'' a philosophical anthropology.<ref>Jacques Derrida describes this in the following terms: \"We can see then that Dasein, though ''not'' man, is nevertheless ''nothing other'' than man.\" Jacques Derrida, \"The Ends of Man\", ''Margins of Philosophy'' (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1982), p. 127.</ref> ''Dasein'', according to Heidegger, ''is'' care.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Blair|first1=Michael|title=\"Heidegger and Aquinas on the Self as Substance\", in Postmodernism and Christian Philosophy edited by Roman Theodore Ciapalo|date=1997|publisher=Amer Maritain Assoc|location=Mishawaka IN|isbn=978-0813208817|pages=39\u201346|url=https://books.google.com/?id=rQneikLwaMoC&pg=PA39&dq=Dasein,+according+to+Heidegger,+is+care#v=onepage&q=Dasein%2C%20according%20to%20Heidegger%2C%20is%20care&f=false|accessdate=27 April 2017}}</ref> The world confronts ''Dasein'' with possibilities. It is not completely deterministic; ''Dasein'' has choices. But ''Dasein'' cannot choose not to face the possibilities presented by the world, including the inevitability of its own mortality. Heidegger in his existential analytic refers to this condition as being \"thrown into the world\", or \"[[thrownness]]\" (''Geworfenheit''). The need for ''Dasein'' to assume these possibilities, that is, the need to be responsible for one's own existence, is the basis of Heidegger's notions of authenticity and resoluteness\u2014that is, of those specific possibilities for ''Dasein'' which depend on escaping the \"vulgar\" temporality of calculation and of public life.\n\nThe marriage of these two observations depends on the fact that each of them is essentially concerned with time. That ''Dasein'' is thrown into an already existing world and thus into its mortal possibilities does not only mean that ''Dasein'' is an essentially temporal being; it also implies that the description of ''Dasein'' can only be carried out in terms inherited from the Western tradition itself. For Heidegger, unlike for Husserl, philosophical terminology could not be divorced from the history of the use of that terminology, and thus genuine philosophy could not avoid confronting questions of language and meaning. The existential analytic of ''Being and Time'' was thus always only a first step in Heidegger's philosophy, to be followed by the \"dismantling\" (''Destruktion'') of the history of philosophy, that is, a transformation of its language and meaning, that would have made of the existential analytic only a kind of \"limit case\" (in the sense in which special relativity is a limit case of general relativity).<ref>Feh\u00e9r, M., Kiss, O., & Ropolyi, L., ''Hermeneutics and Science'' ([[Berlin]]/[[Heidelberg]]: [[Springer Science+Business Media|Springer]], 1999), [https://books.google.com/books?id=cBL8CAAAQBAJ&pg=PA216 p. 216].</ref>{{rp|216}}\n\nThat Heidegger did not write this second part of ''Being and Time'', and that the existential analytic was left behind in the course of Heidegger's subsequent writings on the history of being, might be interpreted as a failure to conjugate his account of ''individual'' experience with his account of the vicissitudes of the ''collective'' human adventure that he understands the Western philosophical tradition to be.

Its importance and continuity in his thinking, Wrathall states, shows that he did not have a \"turn\". A reviewer of Wrathall's book stated: \"An ontology of unconcealment [...] means a description and analysis of the broad contexts in which entities show up as meaningful to us, as well as the conditions under which such contexts, or worlds, emerge and fade.\"<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://ndpr.nd.edu/news/heidegger-and-unconcealment-truth-language-and-history/|title=Review of Heidegger and Unconcealment: Truth, Language, and History|first=Stephan|last=K\u00e4ufer|date=2 July 2011|via=Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews}}</ref>\n\nHeidegger focuses less on the way in which the structures of being are revealed in everyday behavior, and more on the way in which behavior itself depends on a prior \"openness to being.\" The essence of being human is the maintenance of this openness. This \u2018openness to being' can be seen as a basic ability of humans. We experience the world of beings as containing things in which we have an interest or concern.<ref>{{cite web |last1=Wheeler |first1=Michael |title=Martin Heidegger |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2018/entries/heidegger/>. |website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher=Stanford University |accessdate=10 December 2019}}</ref> Heidegger contrasts this openness to the \"will to power\" of the modern human subject, which is one way of forgetting this originary openness.\n\nHeidegger understands the commencement of the history of Western philosophy as a brief period of authentic openness to being, during the time of the [[Pre-Socratic philosophy|pre-Socratics]], especially [[Anaximander]], [[Heraclitus]], and [[Parmenides]]. This was followed, according to Heidegger, by a long period increasingly dominated by the forgetting of this initial openness, a period which commences with [[Plato]], and which occurs in different ways throughout Western history.\n\nTwo recurring themes of Heidegger's later writings are poetry and technology. Heidegger sees poetry and technology as two contrasting ways of \"[[world disclosure|revealing]].\" Poetry reveals being in the way in which, if it is genuine poetry, it commences something new. Technology, on the other hand, when it gets going, inaugurates the world of the dichotomous subject and object, which modern philosophy commencing with Descartes also reveals. But with ''modern'' technology a new stage of revealing is reached, in which the subject-object distinction is overcome even in the \"material\" world of technology. The essence of modern technology is the conversion of the whole universe of beings into an undifferentiated \"standing reserve\" (''Bestand'') of energy available for any use to which humans choose to put it. Heidegger described the essence of modern technology as ''[[Gestell]]'', or \"enframing.\" He does not unequivocally condemn technology: while he acknowledges that modern technology contains grave dangers, Heidegger nevertheless also argues that it may constitute a chance for human beings to enter a new epoch in their relation to being.<ref>For new directions in thinking about Heidegger\u2019s reflections on the essence of modern technology in the context of 21st century considerations of spatiality and the human body against the unfolding of cybernetics, robotics, AI, see: [[Nader El-Bizri]], \u2018Phenomenology of Place and Space in our Epoch: Thinking along Heideggerian Pathways\u2019, in The Phenomenology of Real and Virtual Places, ed.

Heidegger was substantially influenced by [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine of Hippo]] and that ''Being and Time'' would not have been possible without the influence of Augustine's thought. Augustine's  ''[[Confessions (St. Augustine)|Confessions]]'' was particularly influential in shaping Heidegger's thought.<ref>See ''The Influence of Augustine on Heidegger: The Emergence of an Augustinian Phenomenology'', ed.

In pursuit of the retrieval of this question, Heidegger spent considerable time reflecting on [[Greek philosophy|ancient Greek thought]], in particular on Plato, [[Parmenides]], [[Heraclitus]], and Anaximander, as well as on the tragic playwright [[Sophocles]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://web.alfredstate.edu/library/Antigone/Antigone.The%20Ode%20on%20Man.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120611205518/http://web.alfredstate.edu/library/Antigone/Antigone.The%20Ode%20on%20Man.pdf|url-status=dead|title=The Ode on Man in Sophocles' Antigone|archivedate=June 11, 2012}}</ref>\n\n====Dilthey====\n[[File:Wilhelm Dilthey zZ seiner Verlobung.jpg|thumb|140px|Wilhelm Dilthey, the young Heidegger was influenced by Dilthey's works]]\nHeidegger's very early project of developing a \"hermeneutics of [[Facticity|factical]] life\" and his hermeneutical transformation of phenomenology was influenced in part by his reading of the works of [[Wilhelm Dilthey]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=ROCKMORE|first=Tom|year=2003|jstor=23955847|journal=Revue Internationale de Philosophie|volume=57|issue=226 (4)|pages=477\u2013494|title=Dilthey and Historical Reason}}</ref>\n\nOf the influence of Dilthey, [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]] writes the following: \"As far as Dilthey is concerned, we all know today what I have known for a long time: namely that it is a mistake to conclude on the basis of the citation in ''Being and Time'' that Dilthey was especially influential in the development of Heidegger's thinking in the mid-1920s. This dating of the influence is much too late.\" He adds that by the fall of 1923 it was plain that Heidegger felt \"the clear superiority of [[Paul Yorck von Wartenburg|Count Yorck]] over the famous scholar, Dilthey.\" Gadamer nevertheless makes clear that Dilthey's influence was important in helping the youthful Heidegger \"in distancing himself from the systematic ideal of Neo-Kantianism, as Heidegger acknowledges in ''Being and Time''.\"<ref>Hans-Georg Gadamer, \"Martin Heidegger's One Path\", in Theodore Kisiel & John van Buren (eds.), ''Reading Heidegger from the Start: Essays in His Earliest Thought'' (Albany: SUNY Press, 1994), pp. 22\u20134.</ref> Based on Heidegger's earliest lecture courses, in which Heidegger already engages Dilthey's thought prior to the period Gadamer mentions as \"too late\", scholars as diverse as [[Theodore Kisiel]] and [[David Farrell Krell]] have argued for the importance of Diltheyan concepts and strategies in the formation of Heidegger's thought.<ref>In ''The Genesis of Heidegger's Being and Time'' (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1993), Theodor Kisiel designates the first version of the project that culminates in ''Being and Time'', \"the Dilthey draft\" ([https://books.google.com/books?id=5HzJuF-69xQC&lpg=PP1&hl=de&pg=PA313 p. 313]). David Farrell Krell comments in ''Daimon Life: Heidegger and Life-Philosophy'' (Bloomington & Indianapolis: Indiana University Press, 1992) that \"Heidegger's project sprouts (in part, but in ''good'' part) from the soil of Dilthey's philosophy of factical-historical life\" (p. 35).</ref>\n\nEven though Gadamer's interpretation of Heidegger has been questioned, there is little doubt that Heidegger seized upon Dilthey's concept of hermeneutics. Heidegger's novel ideas about ontology required a ''gestalt'' formation, not merely a series of logical arguments, in order to demonstrate his fundamentally new paradigm of thinking, and the [[hermeneutic circle]] offered a new and powerful tool for the articulation and realization of these ideas.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Nelson|first1=Eric S.|title=\"Heidegger and Dilthey: Language, History, and Hermeneutics\", in Horizons of Authenticity in Phenomenology, Existentialism, and Moral Psychology, edited by Hans Pedersen and Megan Altman|date=2014|publisher=Springer|location=Dordrecht|isbn=978-9401794411|pages=109\u201328}}</ref>\n\n====Husserl====\n[[File:Edmund Husserl 1910s.jpg|thumb|140px|Edmund Husserl, the man who established the school of phenomenology]]\nThere is disagreement over the degree of influence that [[Edmund Husserl]] had on Heidegger's philosophical development, just as there is disagreement about the degree to which Heidegger's philosophy is grounded in [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]]. These disagreements centre upon how much of Husserlian phenomenology is contested by Heidegger, and how much this phenomenology in fact informs Heidegger's own understanding.\n\nOn the relation between the two figures, Gadamer wrote: \"When asked about phenomenology, Husserl was quite right to answer as he used to in the period directly after World War I: 'Phenomenology, that is me and Heidegger'.\" Nevertheless, Gadamer noted that Heidegger was no patient collaborator with Husserl, and that Heidegger's \"rash ascent to the top, the incomparable fascination he aroused, and his stormy temperament surely must have made Husserl, the patient one, as suspicious of Heidegger as he always had been of [[Max Scheler]]'s volcanic fire.\"<ref>Hans-Georg Gadamer, \"Martin Heidegger\u201475 Years\", ''Heidegger's Ways'' (Albany: SUNY Press, 1994), p. 18.</ref>\n\nRobert J. Dostal understood the importance of Husserl to be profound:\n<blockquote>Heidegger himself, who is supposed to have broken with Husserl, bases his hermeneutics on an account of time that not only parallels Husserl's account in many ways but seems to have been arrived at through the same phenomenological method as was used by Husserl.... The differences between Husserl and Heidegger are significant, but if we do not see how much it is the case that Husserlian phenomenology provides the framework for Heidegger's approach, we will not be able to appreciate the exact nature of Heidegger's project in ''Being and Time'' or why he left it unfinished.<ref>Robert J. Dostal, \"Time and Phenomenology in Husserl and Heidegger\", in Charles Guignon (ed.), ''The Cambridge Companion to Heidegger'' (Cambridge & New York: Cambridge University Press, 1993), p. 142.</ref></blockquote>\n\nDaniel O. Dahlstrom saw Heidegger's presentation of his work as a departure from Husserl as unfairly misrepresenting Husserl's own work. Dahlstrom concluded his consideration of the relation between Heidegger and Husserl as follows:\n\n<blockquote>Heidegger's silence about the stark similarities between his account of temporality and Husserl's investigation of internal time-consciousness contributes to a ''misrepresentation'' of Husserl's account of intentionality. Contrary to the criticisms Heidegger advances in his lectures, intentionality (and, by implication, the meaning of 'to be') in the final analysis is not construed by Husserl as sheer presence (be it the presence of a fact or object, act or event). Yet for all its \"dangerous closeness\" to what Heidegger understands by temporality, Husserl's account of internal time-consciousness does differ fundamentally. In Husserl's account the structure of protentions is accorded neither the finitude nor the primacy that Heidegger claims are central to the original future of ecstatic-horizonal temporality.<ref>Daniel O.

The lectures on Nietzsche focused on fragments posthumously published under the title ''[[The Will to Power (manuscript)|The Will to Power]]'', rather than on Nietzsche's published works. Heidegger read ''The Will to Power'' as the culminating expression of Western metaphysics, and the lectures are a kind of dialogue between the two thinkers.\n\nThe fundamental differences between the philosophical delineations of Heidegger and [[Adorno]] can be found in their contrasting views of H\u00f6lderlin's poetical works and to a lesser extent in their divergent views on [[German romanticism]] in general. For Heidegger, H\u00f6lderlin expressed the intuitive necessity of metaphysical concepts as a guide for ethical paradigms, devoid of reflection. Adorno, on the other hand, pointed to the dialectic reflection of historical situations, the sociological interpretations of future outcomes, and therefore opposed the liberating principles of intuitive concepts because they negatively surpassed the perception of societal realities.<ref>Oliver Garbrecht (1999).

Max Niemeyer Verlag T\u00fcbingen. {{ISBN|3-484-70029-7}}.</ref>\n\nThis is also the case for the lecture courses devoted to the poetry of Friedrich H\u00f6lderlin, which became an increasingly central focus of Heidegger's work and thought. Heidegger grants to H\u00f6lderlin a singular place within the history of being and the history of Germany, as a herald whose thought is yet to be \"heard\" in Germany or the West. Many of Heidegger's works from the 1930s onwards include meditations on lines from H\u00f6lderlin's poetry, and several of the lecture courses are devoted to the reading of a single poem (see, for example, ''[[H\u00f6lderlin's Hymn \"The Ister\"]]'').\n\n===Heidegger and Eastern thought===\nSome writers on Heidegger's work see possibilities within it for dialogue with traditions of thought outside of Western philosophy, particularly East Asian thinking.{{Citation needed|date=July 2019}} Despite perceived differences between Eastern and Western philosophy, some of Heidegger's later work, particularly \"A Dialogue on Language between a Japanese and an Inquirer\", does show an interest in initiating such a dialogue.<ref>Heidegger, \"A Dialogue on Language between a Japanese and an Inquirer\", in ''On the Way to Language'' (New York: Harper & Row, 1971).</ref> Heidegger himself had contact with a number of leading Japanese intellectuals, including members of the [[Kyoto School]], notably [[Hajime Tanabe]] and [[Kuki Sh\u016bz\u014d]].

London and Philadelphia: Harper & Row</ref> May sees great influence of Taoism and Japanese scholars in Heidegger's work, although this influence is not acknowledged by the author. He asserts: \"The investigation concludes that Heidegger\u2019s work was significantly influenced by East Asian sources. It can be shown, moreover, that in particular instances Heidegger even appropriated wholesale and almost verbatim major ideas from the German translations of Daoist and Zen Buddhist classics. This clandestine textual appropriation of non-Western spirituality, the extent of which has gone undiscovered for so long, seems quite unparalleled, with far-reaching implications for our future interpretation of Heidegger\u2019s work.\"<ref>''Heidegger's hidden sources: East Asian influences on his work'' by Reinhard May, p.

Heidegger's predecessor as Rector formally notified Husserl of his \"enforced leave of absence\" on 14 April 1933.\n\nHeidegger became Rector of the University of Freiburg on 22 April 1933. The following week the national Reich law of 28 April 1933 replaced Reichskommissar Wagner's decree.  The Reich law required the firing of Jewish professors from German universities, including those, such as Husserl, who had converted to Christianity. The termination of the retired professor Husserl's academic privileges thus did not involve any specific action on Heidegger's part.<ref>[http://www.bostonreview.net/BR24.5/benhabib.html#5 Seyla Benhabib, ''The Personal is not the Political''] (October/November 1999 issue of Boston Review.)</ref>\n\nHeidegger had by then broken off contact with Husserl, other than through intermediaries.

Arendt initially suggested that Heidegger's behavior precipitated Husserl's death. She called Heidegger a \"potential murderer.\" However, she later recanted her accusation.<ref>[[Elzbieta Ettinger]],''Hannah Arendt \u2013 Martin Heidegger'', (New Haven, Conn., & London: Yale University Press, 1995), p. 37.</ref>\n\nIn 1939, only a year after Husserl's death, Heidegger wrote in his ''[[Black Notebooks]]'': \"The more original and inceptive the coming decisions and questions become, the more inaccessible will they remain to this [Jewish] 'race'.

However, it subsequently transpired that this qualification had not been made during the original lecture, although Heidegger claimed that it had been. This has led scholars to argue that Heidegger still supported the Nazi party in 1935 but that he did not want to admit this after the war, and so he attempted to silently correct his earlier statement.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Habermas | first1 = J\u00fcrgen | authorlink = J\u00fcrgen Habermas | year = 1989 | title = Work and ''Weltanschauung'': the Heidegger Controversy from a German Perspective | url = | journal = [[Critical Inquiry]] | volume = 15 | issue = 2| pages = 452\u201354 | doi = 10.1086/448492 }} See also [[J.

In an account set down in 1940 (though not intended for publication), L\u00f6with recalled that Heidegger wore a swastika pin to their meeting, though Heidegger knew that L\u00f6with was Jewish.

For instance in a lecture delivered at Bremen in 1949, Heidegger said: \"Agriculture is now a motorized food industry, the same thing in its essence as the production of corpses in the gas chambers and the extermination camps, the same thing as blockades and the reduction of countries to famine, the same thing as the manufacture of hydrogen bombs.\"<ref name=\"Thomas Sheehan\"/>\n\nIn 1967 Heidegger met with the Jewish poet [[Paul Celan]], a concentration camp survivor. Celan visited Heidegger at his country retreat and wrote an enigmatic poem about the meeting, which some interpret as Celan's wish for Heidegger to apologize for his behavior during the Nazi era.<ref>{{Cite journal\n| doi = 10.2307/488241\n| issn = 0094-033X\n| issue = 53\n| pages = 3\u201318\n| last = Anderson\n| first = Mark M.\n| title = The \"Impossibility of Poetry\": Celan and Heidegger in France\n| journal = New German Critique\n| date = 1991-04-01\n| jstor=488241\n}}</ref>\n\n===''Der Spiegel'' interview===\nOn 23 September 1966, Heidegger was interviewed by [[Rudolf Augstein]] and [[Georg Wolff (journalist)|Georg Wolff]] for ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' magazine, in which he agreed to discuss his political past provided that the interview be published posthumously.

Second, he admitted that he saw an \"awakening\" (''Aufbruch'') which might help to find a \"new national and social approach,\" but said that he changed his mind about this in 1934, largely prompted by the violence of the [[Night of the Long Knives]].\n\nIn his interview Heidegger defended as [[double-speak]] his 1935 lecture describing the \"inner truth and greatness of this movement.\" He affirmed that Nazi informants who observed his lectures would understand that by \"movement\" he meant National Socialism. However, Heidegger asserted that his dedicated students would know this statement was no eulogy for the [[Nazi Party]]. Rather, he meant it as he expressed it in the parenthetical clarification later added to ''Introduction to Metaphysics'' (1953), namely, \"the confrontation of planetary technology and modern humanity.\"\n\nThe eyewitness account of L\u00f6with from 1940 contradicts the account given in the ''Der Spiegel'' interview in two ways: that he did not make any decisive break with National Socialism in 1934, and that Heidegger was willing to entertain more profound relations between his philosophy and political involvement. The ''Der Spiegel'' interviewers did not bring up Heidegger's 1949 quotation comparing the industrialization of agriculture to the extermination camps.

He influenced [[Jean Beaufret]], [[:fr:Fran\u00e7ois F\u00e9dier|Fran\u00e7ois F\u00e9dier]], [[Dominique Janicaud]], [[Jean-Luc Marion]], [[:fr:Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Courtine|Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Courtine]] and others.\n\n===Existentialism and pre-war influence===\nHeidegger's influence on French philosophy began in the 1930s, when ''Being and Time'', \"What is Metaphysics?\" and other Heideggerian texts were read by Jean-Paul Sartre and other existentialists, as well as by thinkers such as [[Alexandre Koj\u00e8ve]], [[Georges Bataille]] and [[Emmanuel Levinas]].<ref>On the history of the French translation of Heidegger's \"What is Metaphysics?\", and on its importance to the French intellectual scene, cf. Denis Hollier, \"Plenty of Nothing\", in Hollier (ed.), ''A New History of French Literature'' (Cambridge, Massachusetts, Harvard University Press, 1989), pp. 894\u2013900.</ref> Because Heidegger's discussion of ontology (the study of being) is rooted in an analysis of the mode of existence of individual human beings (''Da-sein'', or there-being), his work has often been associated with existentialism. The influence of Heidegger on Sartre's ''[[Being and Nothingness]]'' (1943) is marked, but Heidegger felt that Sartre had misread his work, as he argued in later texts such as the \"[[Letter on Humanism]]\". In that text, intended for a French audience, Heidegger explained this misreading in the following terms:\n\n<blockquote>Sartre's key proposition about the priority of ''existentia'' over ''essentia''  [that is, Sartre's statement that \"existence precedes essence\"] does, however, justify using the name \"existentialism\" as an appropriate title for a philosophy of this sort. But the basic tenet of \"existentialism\" has nothing at all in common with the statement from ''Being and Time'' [that \"the 'essence' of Dasein lies in its existence\"]\u2014apart from the fact that in ''Being and Time'' no statement about the relation of ''essentia'' and ''existentia'' can yet be expressed, since there it is still a question of preparing something precursory.<ref>Heidegger, \"Letter on Humanism\". ''Pathmarks'' (Cambridge & New York: Cambridge University Press, 1998), pp. 250\u20131.</ref></blockquote>\n\n\"Letter on 'Humanism'\" is often seen as a direct response to Sartre's 1945 lecture \"[[Existentialism Is a Humanism]]\". Aside from merely disputing readings of his own work, however, in the \"Letter on Humanism\" Heidegger asserts that \"Every humanism is either grounded in a metaphysics or is itself made to be the ground of one.\"  Heidegger's largest issue with Sartre's existential humanism is that, while it does make a humanistic 'move' in privileging existence over essence, \"the reversal of a metaphysical statement remains a metaphysical statement.\" From this point onward in his thought, Heidegger attempted to think beyond metaphysics to a place where the articulation of the fundamental questions of ontology were fundamentally possible: only from this point can we restore (that is, re-give [redonner]) any possible meaning to the word \"humanism\".\n\n===Post-war forays into France===\nAfter the war, Heidegger was banned from university teaching for a period on account of his support of Nazism while serving as Rector of Freiburg University.<ref>{{cite book | last = Ott | first = Hugo | title = Martin Heidegger : a political life | publisher = HarperCollinsPublishers BasicBooks | location = Hammersmith, London New York, N.Y | year = 1993 | page = 214ff | isbn = 0465028985 }}</ref> He developed a number of contacts in France, where his work continued to be taught, and a number of French students visited him at [[Todtnauberg]] (see, for example, [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Lyotard]]'s brief account in ''Heidegger and \"the Jews\"'', which discusses a Franco-German conference held in Freiburg in 1947, one step toward bringing together French and German students).{{Citation needed|reason=I was unable to track down a source for this.|date=July 2019}} Heidegger subsequently made several visits to France, and made efforts to keep abreast of developments in French philosophy by way of correspondence with [[Jean Beaufret]], an early French translator of Heidegger, and with Lucien Braun.\n\n===Derrida and deconstruction===\n[[Deconstruction]] came to Heidegger's attention in 1967 by way of Lucien Braun's recommendation of [[Jacques Derrida]]'s work ([[Hans-Georg Gadamer]] was present at an initial discussion and indicated to Heidegger that Derrida's work came to his attention by way of an assistant). Heidegger expressed interest in meeting Derrida personally after the latter sent him some of his work. There was discussion of a meeting in 1972, but this failed to take place.<ref>Krell, David Farrell. \"Troubled Brows: Heidegger\u2019s Black Notebooks, 1942\u20131948.\" Research in Phenomenology 46, no. 2 (2016): 309-335.</ref> Heidegger's interest in Derrida is said by Braun to have been considerable (as is evident in two letters, of September 29, 1967 and May 16, 1972, from Heidegger to Braun). Braun also brought to Heidegger's attention the work of [[Michel Foucault]]. Foucault's relation to Heidegger is a matter of considerable difficulty; Foucault acknowledged Heidegger as a philosopher whom he read but never wrote about. (For more on this see ''Penser \u00e0 Strasbourg,'' Jacques Derrida, et al., which includes reproductions of both letters and an account by Braun, \"\u00c0 mi-chemin entre Heidegger et Derrida\").\n\nDerrida attempted to displace the understanding of Heidegger's work that had been prevalent in France from the period of the ban against Heidegger teaching in German universities, which amounted to an almost wholesale rejection of the influence of [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] and existentialist terms. In Derrida's view, deconstruction is a tradition inherited via Heidegger (the French term \"d\u00e9construction\" is a term coined to translate Heidegger's use of the words \"Destruktion\"\u2014literally \"destruction\"\u2014and \"Abbau\"\u2014more literally \"de-building\"). According to Derrida, Sartre's interpretation of Dasein and other key Heideggerian concerns is overly psychologistic, anthropocentric, and misses the historicality central to ''Dasein'' in ''Being and Time''.\n\n===The Far\u00edas debate===\n[[Jacques Derrida]], [[Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe]], and [[Jean-Fran\u00e7ois Lyotard]], among others, all engaged in debate and disagreement about the relation between Heidegger's philosophy and his Nazi politics. These debates included the question of whether it was possible to do without Heidegger's philosophy, a position which Derrida in particular rejected. Forums where these debates took place include the proceedings of the first conference dedicated to Derrida's work, published as \"Les Fins de l'homme \u00e0 partir du travail de Jacques Derrida: colloque de Cerisy, 23 juillet-2 ao\u00fbt 1980\", Derrida's \"Feu la cendre/cio' che resta del fuoco\", and the studies on [[Paul Celan]] by Lacoue-Labarthe and Derrida which shortly preceded the detailed studies of Heidegger's politics published in and after 1987.\n\nWhen in 1987 [[V\u00edctor Far\u00edas]] published his book ''Heidegger et le nazisme'', this debate was taken up by many others, some of whom were inclined to disparage so-called \"deconstructionists\" for their association with Heidegger's philosophy. Derrida and others not only continued to defend the importance of reading Heidegger, but attacked Far\u00edas on the grounds of poor scholarship and for what they saw as the sensationalism of his approach. Not all scholars agreed with this negative assessment: [[Richard Rorty]], for example, declared that \"[Far\u00edas'] book includes more concrete information relevant to Heidegger's relations with the Nazis than anything else available, and it is an excellent antidote to the evasive apologetics that are still being published.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.temple.edu/tempress/titles/618_reg_print.html|title=Richard Rorty, review of ''Heidegger and Nazism'' in the New Republic, quoted on the Temple University Press promotional page for ''Heidegger and Nazism''}}</ref>\n\n===Bernard Stiegler===\nMore recently, Heidegger's thought has influenced the work of the French philosopher [[Bernard Stiegler]]. This is evident even from the title of Stiegler's multi-volume ''magnum opus'', ''La technique et le temps'' (volume one translated into English as ''[[Technics and Time, 1|Technics and Time, 1: The Fault of Epimetheus]]'').<ref>Bernard Stiegler,'' Technics and Time, 1: The Fault of Epimetheus'' (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1998), part 2.</ref> Stiegler offers an original reading of Heidegger, arguing that there can be no access to \"originary temporality\" other than via material, that is, technical, supports, and that Heidegger recognised this in the form of his account of world historicality, yet in the end suppressed that fact. Stiegler understands the existential analytic of ''Being and Time'' as an account of psychic [[individuation]], and his later \"history of being\" as an account of collective individuation. He understands many of the problems of Heidegger's philosophy and politics as the consequence of Heidegger's inability to integrate the two.\n\n===Giorgio Agamben===\nHeidegger has been very influential on the work of the Italian philosopher [[Giorgio Agamben]]. Agamben attended seminars in France led by Heidegger in the late 1960s.<ref>Durantaye, Leland de la. (2009). Giorgio Agamben. A Critical Introduction. Stanford: Stanford University Press.</ref>\n\n==Criticism==\nHeidegger's influence upon 20th century [[continental philosophy]] is unquestioned and has produced a variety of critical responses.{{Citation needed|reason=Unquestioned?|date=July 2019}}\n\n===Early criticisms===\nAccording to Husserl, ''Being and Time'' claimed to deal with ontology but only did so in the first few pages of the book. Having nothing further to contribute to an ontology independent of human existence, Heidegger changed the topic to ''Dasein''. Whereas Heidegger argued that the question of human existence is central to the pursuit of the question of being, Husserl criticized this as reducing phenomenology to \"philosophical anthropology\" and offering an abstract and incorrect portrait of the human being.<ref>See Edmund Husserl, ''Psychological and transcendental phenomenology and the confrontation with Heidegger (1927\u20131931)'' (Dordrecht: Kluwer, 1997).</ref>\n\nThe [[Neo-Kantian]] [[Ernst Cassirer]] and Heidegger engaged in an influential debate located in [[Davos]] in 1929, concerning the significance of Kantian notions of freedom and rationality (see [[Cassirer\u2013Heidegger debate]]). Whereas Cassirer defended the role of rationality in [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], Heidegger argued for the priority of the imagination.\n\nDilthey's student [[Georg Misch]] wrote the first extended critical appropriation of Heidegger in ''Lebensphilosophie und Ph\u00e4nomenologie. Eine Auseinandersetzung der Diltheyschen Richtung mit Heidegger und Husserl'', Leipzig 1930 (3rd ed. Stuttgart 1964).\n\n===The [[Young Hegelian]]s and critical theory===\n[[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]]-influenced Marxist thinkers, especially [[Gy\u00f6rgy Luk\u00e1cs]] and the [[Frankfurt School]], associated the style and content of Heidegger's thought with German irrationalism and criticized its political implications.<ref>[[Tom Rockmore|Rockmore, T.]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=feWlC4ioGTYC&printsec=frontcover ''On Heidegger's Nazism and Philosophy''] (Berkeley, Los Angeles, London: [[University of California Press]], 1992), pp. 57, 75, 149, 258.</ref>\n\nInitially members of the Frankfurt School were positively disposed to Heidegger, becoming more critical at the beginning of the 1930s. Heidegger's student Herbert Marcuse became associated with the Frankfurt School. Initially striving for a synthesis between Hegelian Marxism and Heidegger's phenomenology, Marcuse later rejected Heidegger's thought for its \"false concreteness\" and \"revolutionary conservativism.\" [[Theodor Adorno]] wrote an extended critique of the ideological character of Heidegger's early and later use of language in the ''Jargon of Authenticity''. Contemporary social theorists associated with the Frankfurt School have remained largely critical of Heidegger's works and influence. In particular, [[J\u00fcrgen Habermas]] admonishes the influence of Heidegger on recent French philosophy in his polemic against \"postmodernism\" in ''[[The Philosophical Discourse of Modernity]]'' (1985). However, work by philosopher and critical theorist [[Nikolas Kompridis]] tries to show that Heidegger's insights into [[world disclosure]] are badly misunderstood and mishandled by Habermas, and are of vital importance for critical theory, offering an important way of [[reflective disclosure|renewing that tradition]].<ref>Nikolas Kompridis, ''Critique and Disclosure: Critical Theory between Past and Future'' MIT Press, 2006.{{page needed|date=April 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/09672550500169125 |title=Disclosing Possibility: The Past and Future of Critical Theory1 |journal=International Journal of Philosophical Studies |volume=13 |issue=3 |pages=325\u201351 |year=2005 |last1=Kompridis |first1=Nikolas }}</ref>\n\n===Reception by analytic and Anglo-American philosophy===\nCriticism of Heidegger's philosophy has also come from [[analytic philosophy]], beginning with [[logical positivism]]. In \"The Elimination of Metaphysics Through Logical Analysis of Language\" (1932), [[Rudolf Carnap]] accused Heidegger of offering an \"illusory\" ontology, criticizing him for committing the fallacy of [[Reification (fallacy)|reification]] and for wrongly dismissing the logical treatment of language which, according to Carnap, can only lead to writing \"nonsensical pseudo-propositions.\"\n\nThe British logical positivist [[A. J. Ayer]] was strongly critical of Heidegger's philosophy. In Ayer's view, Heidegger proposed vast, overarching theories regarding existence, which are completely unverifiable through empirical demonstration and logical analysis. For Ayer, this sort of philosophy was a poisonous strain in modern thought. He considered Heidegger to be the worst example of such philosophy, which Ayer believed to be entirely useless.\n\n[[Bertrand Russell]] considered Heidegger an [[obscurantist]], writing, \n<blockquote>Highly eccentric in its terminology, his philosophy is extremely obscure. One cannot help suspecting that language is here running riot. An interesting point in his speculations is the insistence that nothingness is something positive. As with much else in Existentialism, this is a psychological observation made to pass for logic.<ref>{{cite book|last = Russell|first = Bertrand|authorlink = Bertrand Russell|title = Wisdom of the West|publisher = Crescent Books|year = 1989|page = 303|isbn = 978-0-517-69041-3}}</ref></blockquote>\nThis quote expresses the sentiments of many 20th-century analytic philosophers concerning Heidegger.<ref>{{cite book|title=Heidegger: An Introduction|first=Richard|last=Polt|date=7 January 1999|publisher=Cornell University Press|isbn = 978-0801485640}}</ref>\n\n[[Roger Scruton]] stated that:  \"His major work ''Being and Time'' is formidably difficult\u2014unless it is utter nonsense, in which case it is laughably easy. I am not sure how to judge it, and have read no commentator who even begins to make sense of it\".<ref>Jeff Collins, ''Introducing Heidegger'' (Thriplow, Cambridge: Icon Books, 1998), p. 7.</ref>\n\nThe analytic tradition values clarity of expression. Heidegger, however, has on occasion appeared to take an opposing view, stating for example:\n\n<blockquote>those in the crossing must in the end know what is mistaken by all urging for intelligibility: that every thinking of being, all philosophy, can ''never'' be confirmed by \"facts,\" i.e., by beings. Making itself intelligible is suicide for philosophy. Those who idolize \"facts\" never notice that their idols only shine in a borrowed light. They are also meant not to notice this; for thereupon they would have to be at a loss and therefore useless. But idolizers and idols are used wherever gods are in flight and so announce ''their'' nearness.<ref name=\"MartinHeidegger\">Martin Heidegger, ''Contributions to Philosophy (From Enowning)'' (Bloomington & Indianapolis: Indiana University Press, 1999), p. 307.</ref></blockquote>\n\nApart from the charge of [[obscurantism]], other analytic philosophers considered the actual content of Heidegger's work to be either faulty and meaningless, vapid or uninteresting. However, not all analytic philosophers have been as hostile. [[Gilbert Ryle]] wrote a critical yet positive review of ''Being and Time''. [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] made a remark recorded by [[Friedrich Waismann]]: \"To be sure, I can imagine what Heidegger means by being and anxiety\"<ref>''Wittgenstein and the Vienna Circle: Conversations Recorded by Friedrich Waismann'', Basil Blackwell, Oxford, 1979, p. 68</ref> which has been construed by some commentators<ref>James Luchte, \u2018Under the Aspect of Time (\"sub specie temporis\"): Heidegger, Wittgenstein, and the Place of the Nothing,\u2019 Philosophy Today, Volume 53, Number 2, 2009.</ref> as sympathetic to Heidegger's philosophical approach. These positive and negative analytic evaluations have been collected in Michael Murray (ed.), ''Heidegger and Modern Philosophy: Critical Essays'' (Yale University Press, 1978). Heidegger's reputation within English-language philosophy has slightly improved in philosophical terms in some part through the efforts of [[Hubert Dreyfus]], [[Richard Rorty]], and a recent generation of analytically oriented phenomenology scholars. Pragmatist Rorty claimed that Heidegger's approach to philosophy in the first half of his career has much in common with that of the latter-day Ludwig Wittgenstein. Nevertheless, Rorty asserted that what Heidegger had constructed in his writings was a myth of being rather than an account of it.<ref>Jeff Collins, ''Introducing Heidegger'' (Thriplow, Cambridge: Icon Books, 1998), p. 170.</ref>\n\n===Contemporary European reception===\nAlthough Heidegger is considered by many observers to be one of the most influential philosophers of the 20th century,<ref>{{cite book |last1=Honderich |first1=Ted |title=Oxford Companion to Philosophy |url=https://archive.org/details/oxfordcompaniont00hond |url-access=registration |date=1995 |publisher=Oxford |isbn=978-0-19-926479-7 |page=[https://archive.org/details/oxfordcompaniont00hond/page/375 375] |edition=Second}}</ref> aspects of his work have been criticised by those who nevertheless acknowledge this influence, such as [[Hans-Georg Gadamer]] and [[Jacques Derrida]]. Some questions raised about Heidegger's philosophy include the priority of ontology, the status of animals, the nature of the religious, Heidegger's supposed neglect of ethics (Levinas), the body ([[Maurice Merleau-Ponty]]), sexual difference ([[Luce Irigaray]]), or space ([[Peter Sloterdijk]]).<ref>Elden, S., ''Sloterdijk Now'' (Cambridge: [[Polity Press]], 2012), [https://books.google.cz/books?id=AU5_Vd-O4e4C&pg=PA85#v=onepage&q&f=false pp. 85\u201388].</ref>{{rp|85\u201388}}\n\nLevinas was deeply influenced by Heidegger, and yet became one of his fiercest critics, contrasting the infinity of the good beyond being with the immanence and totality of ontology. Levinas also condemned Heidegger's involvement with National Socialism, stating: \"One can forgive many Germans, but there are some Germans it is difficult to forgive. It is difficult to forgive Heidegger.\"<ref>Emmanuel Levinas, ''Nine Talmudic Readings'' (Indiana University Press, 1990), p. xxv, translated by Annette Aronowicz</ref>\n\nHeidegger's defenders, notably Arendt, see his support for Nazism as arguably a personal \" 'error' \" (a word which Arendt placed in quotation marks when referring to Heidegger's Nazi-era politics).<ref>Hannah Arendt, ''Martin Heidegger At 80'', New York Review of Books, 17/6, (Oct. 21, 1971), 50\u201354; repr. in ''Heidegger and Modern Philosophy'' ed.

Because they were minted to the official specifications of the 5 francs coin, they were nevertheless circulated ''de facto''.<ref>[http://www.swissmint.ch/d/downloads/aktuell/FAQ-de.pdf Swissmint FAQ], p. 9, citing ''Revue Suisse de Numismatique'', 1894, p. 56.</ref>\nAfter 1885, the federal mint was dissuaded from minting these semi-official coins on the part of the [[Latin Monetary Union]]. After the demise of the Monetary Union, the Swiss federal mint issued two further Sch\u00fctzentaler, in 1934 and 1939.\n\nIn a somewhat wider sense, the term ''Sch\u00fctzentaler'' is extended to non-official silver [[commemorative coins]] of thaler size, minted privately for the federal festivals between 1890 and 1929 and from 1949 to present, as well as for numerous [[cantons of Switzerland|cantonal]] festivals. \n\nMost shooting thaler designs depict strongly cantonal or patriotic themes, such as historical military leaders or [[heraldry]]. The 1851 coin minted by Geneva and the 1855 coin minted by the Swiss federal mint for the [[Solothurn]] cantonal festival of 1855 are identical in design to their regular  [[Circulation (currency)|circulating]] counterparts.\n\nThe entire series can be distinguished from the much more varied genre of shooting medals (''Sch\u00fctzenmedaillen'') by their adherence  to the specifications of circulating coinage (with the exception of the three cantonal speciments, the [[Swiss 5 francs coin]]). All but the [[Stans]] (1861) and [[St. Gallen]] (1874) issues are denominated. \nMany nineteenth-century issues were also struck in various other metals besides silver, including gold and [[white metal]], in small quantities. \n\n== History ==\n\n[[File:Fribourg1934shootingthaler.jpg|thumb|right|240px|alt=At left, the obverse of the silver-colored thaler, featuring a standing soldier looking left, a rifle in his right hand, surrounded by the inscription TIR FEDERAL FRIBOURG 1934.

no coins denominated as thalers were officially issued within the Swiss Confederation, many coins measuring between 30 and 40&nbsp;millimeters have been given the name unofficially due to the similarity in size to German and Austrian thalers.<ref name=twentytwo>Krause, p. 10</ref>\n\n== Shooting medals ==\n\nThe first shooting [[medal]]s were struck in honor of the Officers' Shoot held in [[Langenthal, Switzerland|Langenthal]], Bern, in 1822.<ref name=twentythree>Krause, p. 11</ref> They can usually be distinguished from shooting thalers by their lack of denomination and difference in weight and often composition, though there is evidence that many of thaler-size did circulate amongst the legal tender coins of Switzerland.<ref name=twentytwo/> Shooting medals were minted in a variety of metals, including silver, [[bronze]], goldene and white metal.<ref name=twentythree/>\n\n== Other countries ==\n\nThough not considered shooting thalers, some other [[Culture of Europe|European]] coin-issuing entities have minted coins to honor or promote shooting festivals that took place within their territory. Examples include the [[States of Germany|German States]] of [[Baden]],<ref>Krause & Mishler, p. 355</ref> [[Bremen]],<ref>Krause & Mishler, p. 373</ref> [[Frankfurt am Main]]<ref>Krause & Mishler, p. 383</ref> and [[Hanover]],<ref>Bruce, p. 155</ref> as well as the Swiss canton of [[Vaud]].<ref name=\"vaud\"/>\n\n== See also ==\n\n{{Portal|Numismatics|Money}}\n\n*[[Swiss franc]]\n*[[Coins of the Swiss franc]] \u2013 Currently minted Swiss coins.\n* [[1804 dollar]] \u2013 The Class II 1804 Dollar was struck over an 1857 Bern shooting thaler.\n\n== References ==\n\n{{Reflist|colwidth=25em}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n*Bruce, Colin R.

After the demise of the Monetary Union, the Swiss federal mint issued two further Sch\u00fctzentaler, in 1934 and 1939.\n\nIn a somewhat wider sense, the term ''Sch\u00fctzentaler'' is extended to non-official silver [[commemorative coins]] of thaler size, minted privately for the federal festivals between 1890 and 1929 and from 1949 to present, as well as for numerous [[cantons of Switzerland|cantonal]] festivals. \n\nMost shooting thaler designs depict strongly cantonal or patriotic themes, such as historical military leaders or [[heraldry]]. The 1851 coin minted by Geneva and the 1855 coin minted by the Swiss federal mint for the [[Solothurn]] cantonal festival of 1855 are identical in design to their regular  [[Circulation (currency)|circulating]] counterparts.\n\nThe entire series can be distinguished from the much more varied genre of shooting medals (''Sch\u00fctzenmedaillen'') by their adherence  to the specifications of circulating coinage (with the exception of the three cantonal speciments, the [[Swiss 5 francs coin]]). All but the [[Stans]] (1861) and [[St. Gallen]] (1874) issues are denominated. \nMany nineteenth-century issues were also struck in various other metals besides silver, including gold and [[white metal]], in small quantities. \n\n== History ==\n\n[[File:Fribourg1934shootingthaler.jpg|thumb|right|240px|alt=At left, the obverse of the silver-colored thaler, featuring a standing soldier looking left, a rifle in his right hand, surrounded by the inscription TIR FEDERAL FRIBOURG 1934.

All of these pieces, as well as the 1855 [[Solothurn]] issue, were strictly legal tender.<ref name=\"one\">Bruce, p. 455</ref> Nineteenth-century Confederation shooting thaler issues were minted to legal fineness, and were thus allowed to bear the denomination of five [[Swiss franc|francs]].<ref name=\"one\"/> Beginning in 1865, Switzerland became a member of the [[Latin Monetary Union]].<ref name=\"two\">[[Peter Kenen|Kenen, Peter B.]] & Meade, Ellen E.

no coins denominated as thalers were officially issued within the Swiss Confederation, many coins measuring between 30 and 40&nbsp;millimeters have been given the name unofficially due to the similarity in size to German and Austrian thalers.<ref name=twentytwo>Krause, p. 10</ref>\n\n== Shooting medals ==\n\nThe first shooting [[medal]]s were struck in honor of the Officers' Shoot held in [[Langenthal, Switzerland|Langenthal]], Bern, in 1822.<ref name=twentythree>Krause, p. 11</ref> They can usually be distinguished from shooting thalers by their lack of denomination and difference in weight and often composition, though there is evidence that many of thaler-size did circulate amongst the legal tender coins of Switzerland.<ref name=twentytwo/> Shooting medals were minted in a variety of metals, including silver, [[bronze]], goldene and white metal.<ref name=twentythree/>\n\n== Other countries ==\n\nThough not considered shooting thalers, some other [[Culture of Europe|European]] coin-issuing entities have minted coins to honor or promote shooting festivals that took place within their territory. Examples include the [[States of Germany|German States]] of [[Baden]],<ref>Krause & Mishler, p. 355</ref> [[Bremen]],<ref>Krause & Mishler, p. 373</ref> [[Frankfurt am Main]]<ref>Krause & Mishler, p. 383</ref> and [[Hanover]],<ref>Bruce, p. 155</ref> as well as the Swiss canton of [[Vaud]].<ref name=\"vaud\"/>\n\n== See also ==\n\n{{Portal|Numismatics|Money}}\n\n*[[Swiss franc]]\n*[[Coins of the Swiss franc]] \u2013 Currently minted Swiss coins.\n* [[1804 dollar]] \u2013 The Class II 1804 Dollar was struck over an 1857 Bern shooting thaler.\n\n== References ==\n\n{{Reflist|colwidth=25em}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n\n*Bruce, Colin R.

At the [[United Kingdom Census 2011|2011 Census]], its population was 91,544<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/LeadKeyFigures.do?a=7&b=6275109&c=Gosport&d=13&e=62&g=6429974&i=1001x1003x1032x1004&m=0&r=1&s=1428339590873&enc=1 |title=Area: Gosport (Local Authority): Key Figures for 2011 Census: Key Statistics |work=[[Neighbourhood Statistics]] |publisher=[[Office for National Statistics]] |accessdate=6 April 2015}}</ref> It is situated on a [[peninsula]] on the western side of [[Portsmouth Harbour]], opposite the city of [[Portsmouth]], to which it is linked by the [[Gosport Ferry]]. Gosport lies south-east of Fareham, to which it is linked by a [[South East Hampshire Bus Rapid Transit|Bus Rapid Transit]] route and the [[A32 road|A32]]. Until the last quarter of the 20th century, Gosport was a major naval town associated with the defence and supply infrastructure of [[HMNB Portsmouth|Her Majesty's Naval Base (HMNB) Portsmouth]]. As such over the years extensive fortifications were created.\n\nThe town is still home to {{HMS|Sultan|establishment|6}} and a [[DM Gosport|Naval Armament Supply Facility]], as well as a Helicopter Repair base. The Town area of the Borough, including Newtown, consists of the town centre, Stoke Road shopping area, Walpole Park, Royal Clarence Yard and three modern marinas: Royal Clarence, Gosport Marina and Haslar Marina. As part of the ''Renaissance of Portsmouth Harbour'' [[Millennium Commission|Millennium]] project, a large sundial, known as the Millennium Timespace, was installed on the harbour front in 2000.\n\n==Name==\nThough there are multiple theories which point towards the etymology of Gosport, it is widely purported to derive its name from \"goose\". An alternative etymology of \"gorse\" (from the bushes growing on local heathland) is not supported by the regional name for the plant, \"furze\". A third theory, claiming a derivation from \"God's Port\" is believed to be a 19th-century invention. This is, however, the slogan of Gosport as demonstrated on its emblem. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www3.hants.gov.uk/gdc/gosport-dc-local-studies/local-history-online/place-names-of-gosport.htm |last=Eley |first=Philip |title=The Place Names of Gosport, an unofficial portrayal |work=Hantsweb |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081007203501/http://www3.hants.gov.uk/gdc/gosport-dc-local-studies/local-history-online/place-names-of-gosport.htm |archivedate=7 October 2008}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe [[Rowner]] area of the peninsula was settled by the [[Anglo-Saxon England|Anglo-Saxon]]s, and is mentioned in the ''[[Anglo Saxon Chronicle]]'' as Rughenor (\"rough bank or slope\"). Both Rowner and [[Alverstoke]], the name coming from the point where the River Alver entered [[the Solent]] at [[Stokes Bay]], were included in the [[Domesday Book]]. [[Rowner]] was the earliest known settlement of the peninsula, with many [[Prehistoric Britain#Mesolithic|Mesolithic]] finds and a hunting camp being found, and [[tumuli]] on the peninsula investigated. [[Bronze Age]] items found in a 1960s construction in {{HMS|Sultan|establishment|6}} included a hoard of axe heads and torcs. A three-celled dwelling unearthed during construction of the Rowner naval Estate in the 1970s points to a settled landscape. Next to the River Alver which passes the southern and western edge of Rowner is a [[Norman England|Norman]] motte and bailey, the first fortification of the peninsula, giving a vantage point over the Solent, [[Stokes Bay]], [[Lee-on-the-Solent]] and the [[Isle of Wight]]. The former Rowner naval married quarters estate, now mostly demolished, and HMS ''Sultan'' were built on a former military airfield, known first as [[RAF Gosport]] and later as HMS ''Siskin'', which gives its name to the local infant and junior schools. The barracks at [[Browndown Battery|Browndown (Stokes Bay)]] were used in the ITV series ''[[Bad Lads' Army]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.localhistories.org/gosport.html |last=Lambert |first=Tim |title=A Brief History of Gosport |work=A World History Encyclopedia |accessdate= }}</ref>\n\n== Politics ==\nThe district is currently run by the Gosport Borough Council. Following the 2018 Borough Council elections, the political structure of the Council is as follows:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Party\n!Seats\n|-\n|Conservative\n|18\n|-\n|Liberal Democrat\n|14\n|-\n|Labour\n|2\n|}\n\n[[Caroline Dinenage]] currently serves as the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] Member of Parliament for Gosport, and has done so since 2010, after gaining a 48.0% majority vote in the [[2010 United Kingdom general election|2010 General Election]].\n\n==Naval and military==\nUntil the last quarter of the 20th century, Gosport was a major naval town associated with the defence and supply infrastructure of [[HMNB Portsmouth|Her Majesty's Naval Base (HMNB) Portsmouth]]. As such over the years extensive fortifications were created.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gosportsociety.co.uk/towndefences.htm |title=The Gosport Town Defences |website=Gosport Society |accessdate=13 September 2017}}</ref> The first fortifications were in 1678 during the reign on Charles II. These consisted of two forts, Fort James and Fort Charles, and a series of bastions and double ditches to encircle the town, known as the Gosport Lines. During the Georgian period in 1751 and 1752 they were rebuilt, enlarged and extended. Further additions were made in response to the French invasion threat of 1779. By 1860, the Gosport Lines had 58 guns. No.1 Bastion, for example, had mounted 14 guns in brick lined emplacements firing over the parapet. The 1859 Royal Commission on the Defences of the United Kingdom proposed the completion of [[Palmerston Forts, Portsmouth|a line of forts]] to protect the outer approach to Gosport town, making the earlier defences redundant. However, they were retained to constrain any expansion of the town towards the new line of forts. From the 1890s road widening meant some parts of the ramparts and gates were demolished. Further sections were demolished in the 1920s and 1960s. Today, the little that remain are protected ancient monuments.\n\nThe town is still home to {{HMS|Sultan|establishment|6}} and a [[DM Gosport|Naval Armament Supply Facility]] as well as a Helicopter Repair base; however, Gosport's naval history is very long, and the town has several buildings of historic interest as well as connections with many people who became famous. Most of the former naval and military installations have closed since the [[Second World War]], leaving empty sites and buildings. In response to this, museums have opened, and many of the fortifications and installations (such as [[Fort Brockhurst]], [[Priddy's Hard]] (formerly an [[Royal Naval Armaments Depot|Armament Depot]], now the [[Explosion!

The visit lasted several months and during this time some of the members of the crew contracted cholera and were admitted to Haslar Hospital for treatment, where most of them died. In addition, some other sailors died because of training accidents. In total 26 died and were laid to rest in the grounds of Haslar. At the turn of the 20th century the bodies were exhumed and transferred to the R.N. Military Cemetery, Clayhall Road, in [[Alverstoke]].\n\n====Preparations for the D Day Landings====\n[[File:Allied Preparations For D-day H39000.jpg|thumb|Sherman tanks of the 13th/18th Hussars, embarking onto LCT-610, 3 June 1944]]\nIn the first week of June 1944, tanks, scout cars and wheeled vehicles of the [[Sherbrooke Hussars|Sherbrooke Fusilier Regiment]], [[Canadian Army]] loaded [[Landing craft tank]]s in Gosport. Convoys of vehicles had been carefully concealed from German discovery in the areas further inland, and in daylight on 3 June moved through Titchfield and [[Stubbington]] to G3 Hard on the Gosport waterfront. There, the [[M4 Sherman]] tanks were backed into position in preparation for the Channel crossing. The initial plan was for the invasion to begin on 5 June, but bad weather, with the various vessels riding at anchor off Calshot in the Solent, delayed the plans by one day.<ref>{{cite book |last=Jackson |first=LtCol HM |year=1958 |title=The Sherbrooke Regiment (12th Armoured Regiment) |place= |publisher=privately published |page= }}{{page needed|date=April 2015}}</ref>\n\n====Gallery of historic buildings====\n\n=====Naval=====\n<gallery>\nFile:Royal Naval Hospital Haslar - geograph.org.uk - 593470.jpg|Royal Naval Hospital, Haslar\nFile:St Vincent's College - geograph.org.uk - 1327446.jpg|Forton Barracks (Royal Marine Light Infantry; later [[HMS St Vincent (Gosport shore establishment)|HMS ''St Vincent'']])\nFile:Haslar Road - geograph.org.uk - 877388.jpg|[[Haslar]] Gunboat Yard and Admiralty Experimental Works (perimeter wall)\nFile:Gate to Clarence Yard - geograph.org.uk - 510.jpg|Gate to the Royal Clarence [[Victualling Yard]]\nFile:St Clarence Yard Gate Maintenance.jpg|Gate to the Royal Clarence Victualling Yards under Maintenance, 2019.\nFile:Priddy's Hard Building 2019.jpg|Offices & Storehouse, [[Royal Naval Armaments Depot]], [[Priddy's Hard]] (2019)\n</gallery>\n\n=====Military=====\n<gallery>\nFile:Fort Blockhouse 03.jpg|[[Fort Blockhouse]]\nFile:Moat around Fort Brockhurst (1) - geograph.org.uk - 1038063.jpg|[[Fort Brockhurst]], moat\nFile:Fort Grange-Gosport - geograph.org.uk - 704885.jpg|[[Fort Grange]]\nFile:Fort Rowner-Gosport - geograph.org.uk - 704877.jpg|[[Fort Rowner]], entrance\nFile:St.Georges Barracks - Gosport - geograph.org.uk - 814259.jpg|St George Barracks (Infantry)\nFile:Gosport Barracks geograph-4115962-by-Ben-Brooksbank.jpg|St George Barracks, guardhouse\n</gallery>\n\n==Geography==\nThe Town area of the Borough, including Newtown, consists of the town centre, Stoke Road shopping area, Walpole Park, Royal Clarence Yard and three modern marinas: Royal Clarence, Gosport Marina and Haslar Marina.\n\nSouth of the centre is Haslar Creek, which flows into Portsmouth Harbour near the harbour mouth. The lowest part of Haslar Creek is called Haslar Lake; at its western end, the creek splits into two branches. These are called Workhouse Lake (the northern branch) and Stoke Lake (the southern branch). South East of Stoke Lake and along Gilkicker Point is the area of Clayhall.\n\nWest, Northwest and South of Stoke Lake is the district and village of [[Alverstoke]]. To the west of which is Browndown, where the River Alver flows into The Solent at Stokes Bay. Further west from Browndown point is the district of [[Lee-on-the-Solent]] with the former RNAS ''Daedalus'' which is now home to a hovercraft museum and several marine related businesses, and CEMAST College (Fareham College). It is also used as a base for glider clubs, light aeroplanes, [[Her Majesty's Coastguard|HM Coastguard]] heliport and police aircraft.\n\nIn the west of Gosport is the naval base HMS ''Sultan''. West of HMS ''Sultan'' is the district of Rowner which includes Alver Village.\n\nThere are several districts north, northwest and west of the town centre. These include areas that extend to the inland areas of the peninsula, [[Hardway, Hampshire|Hardway]] (including Priddy's Hard and [[Forton Lake]]) Elson, Brockhurst, Bridgemary and Rowner. Hoeford (A32 Gosport Road) is the most northwesterly area within Gosport, and ends at the boundary with the [[Borough of Fareham]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gosport.gov.uk/onlinemaps/ |title=Online maps |publisher=Gosport.gov.uk |accessdate=29 May 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Climate==\nThe climate of Gosport is milder than that of the surrounding areas, winter frosts being light and short-lived and snow quite rare. Temperatures rarely drop much below freezing, because the peninsula has water to the south and east. Portsdown Hill also protects the town from the cold northerly winds during the winter months. Located on the south coast, Gosport also receives more sunshine per annum than most of the UK. The average maximum temperature in January is 8C with the average minimum being 3C. The average maximum temperature in July is 21C, with the average minimum being 14C. The record high temperature is 32C and record low is -9C.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.tutiempo.net/en/Climate/SOLENT_M_R_S_C/38740.htm |title=Climate Solent M.R.S.C. |work=World Weather |publisher=TuTiempo.net |accessdate=}}</ref><ref>[[Portsmouth|Gosport climate information adapted from Portsmouth climate information.

The [[Gosport Ferry]] provides quick access to [[Portsmouth Harbour railway station]], terminus of the [[Portsmouth Direct Line]] to [[London]]. Due to heavy traffic (see below) this ferry is very well used. At one time the Gosport Ferry Company operated steam ferries, until the arrival in 1966 of two identical (and then very modern) diesel ferries, named ''Gosport Queen'' and ''Portsmouth Queen''. In 1971 a third ferry called ''Solent Enterprise'' joined the fleet. She was a slightly larger, more luxurious version of the \"Queens\". The company now operates two new modern ferries along with the two 1966 veterans. The first was built in 2001 and is named ''Spirit of Gosport''. After the retirement of the ''Solent Enterprise'' in 2003, a second modern and slightly larger ferry was added to the fleet and was named the ''Spirit of Portsmouth''. All ferries have been able to carry cycles and motorcycles.\n\nGosport received its railway before Portsmouth, but it closed to passengers in 1953. In 1841 a railway opened between the [[London and Southampton Railway]] at {{rws|Eastleigh}} via {{rws|Fareham}} to Gosport, where a [[terminal station|terminus]] was built to an [[Italianate]] design of Sir [[William Tite]]. [[Gosport railway station]] was intended to serve Portsmouth across the water, but was sited at Gosport away from the harbour because the railway company was not allowed to breach either the [[Hilsea Lines]], defences at the northern end of [[Portsea Island]] protecting [[Portsmouth]], or the Gosport Lines protecting depots such as Royal Clarence Yard.\n\nAn extension to Royal Clarence Yard was opened in 1846, and branch lines to [[Stokes Bay]] (open from 1863 to 1915), and to [[Lee-on-the-Solent]] (open to passengers 1894 to 1931). Due to declining traffic, the connection to Fareham was closed for passenger services in 1953 and to freight traffic in 1969, although trains to the armament depot in Frater ran until the late 1970s.\n\nThe trackbed of the former Gosport \u2013 Fareham railway is now an exclusive fast bus route and cycle lane. Tite's station building has been retained for its historical and architectural value and has been converted into a small number of residential properties and offices. The main gate in Spring Garden Lane has been opened up for vehicle access. A further development of six terraced homes has been built at the north western end of the site linking with George Street.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hermitage-housing.co.uk/page.asp?id=349 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120802023136/http://www.hermitage-housing.co.uk/page.asp?id=349 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2 August 2012 |title=Gosport Railway |publisher=[[The Guinness Partnership|Hermitage Housing Association]]}}</ref>\n\nBeing a peninsula town without a railway system, Gosport relies heavily upon the major [[A32 road]] in and out of the town. Plans existed in the 1970s to widen the road to accommodate expected increases in traffic flow, but this did not take place. In the early 1990s a computerised system controlling traffic lights along the route was installed to improve the rate of flow of traffic but this failed to work and had to be switched off since it could not cope with the traffic volumes. Now, in the 21st century, the A32 is much the same as it was thirty years ago{{when|date=August 2019}} and the traffic using it has increased to such an extent that the journey time to the nearby M27, about {{convert|5|mi|0}}, can routinely take anything from 45 minutes and often longer at peak times between 07:30 & 09:00 and 16:00 & 18:30.\n\nThe station site was linked with the [[South Hampshire Rapid Transit]] scheme, which would have made use of the former railway route. However, due to Government refusal to fund the scheme, it was formally abandoned in November 2006.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hants.gov.uk/press/2006/pr3190.html |title=Tram scheme to be formally abandoned |publisher=Hantsweb |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070112031656/http://www.hants.gov.uk/press/2006/pr3190.html |archivedate=12 January 2007 }}</ref> During 2010, construction started on the same route to provide a rapid bus route between the Holbrook area of Gosport and the town of Fareham. Now completed, regular service buses between Gosport and Fareham divert onto the new route avoiding lengthy queues on the A32 and speeding up commuting time between the towns for bus passengers.\n\n==Present day==\n[[File:Forton Bridge 2019.jpg|thumb|Forton Lake Millennium Bridge 2019]]\n\nThe [[United Kingdom Census 2001|2001 Census]] recorded 54,854 people in Gosport of working age between the ages of 16 and 74.

({{IPAc-en|\u02c8|\u0261|\u0252|s|p|\u0254\u0259r|t}} {{respell|GOS|port}}) is a town in [[Hampshire]] on the south coast of the United Kingdom. At the [[United Kingdom Census 2011|2011 Census]], its population was 91,544<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.neighbourhood.statistics.gov.uk/dissemination/LeadKeyFigures.do?a=7&b=6275109&c=Gosport&d=13&e=62&g=6429974&i=1001x1003x1032x1004&m=0&r=1&s=1428339590873&enc=1 |title=Area: Gosport (Local Authority): Key Figures for 2011 Census: Key Statistics |work=[[Neighbourhood Statistics]] |publisher=[[Office for National Statistics]] |accessdate=6 April 2015}}</ref> It is situated on a [[peninsula]] on the western side of [[Portsmouth Harbour]], opposite the city of [[Portsmouth]], to which it is linked by the [[Gosport Ferry]]. Gosport lies south-east of Fareham, to which it is linked by a [[South East Hampshire Bus Rapid Transit|Bus Rapid Transit]] route and the [[A32 road|A32]]. Until the last quarter of the 20th century, Gosport was a major naval town associated with the defence and supply infrastructure of [[HMNB Portsmouth|Her Majesty's Naval Base (HMNB) Portsmouth]]. As such over the years extensive fortifications were created.\n\nThe town is still home to {{HMS|Sultan|establishment|6}} and a [[DM Gosport|Naval Armament Supply Facility]], as well as a Helicopter Repair base. The Town area of the Borough, including Newtown, consists of the town centre, Stoke Road shopping area, Walpole Park, Royal Clarence Yard and three modern marinas: Royal Clarence, Gosport Marina and Haslar Marina. As part of the ''Renaissance of Portsmouth Harbour'' [[Millennium Commission|Millennium]] project, a large sundial, known as the Millennium Timespace, was installed on the harbour front in 2000.\n\n==Name==\nThough there are multiple theories which point towards the etymology of Gosport, it is widely purported to derive its name from \"goose\". An alternative etymology of \"gorse\" (from the bushes growing on local heathland) is not supported by the regional name for the plant, \"furze\". A third theory, claiming a derivation from \"God's Port\" is believed to be a 19th-century invention. This is, however, the slogan of Gosport as demonstrated on its emblem. <ref>{{cite web |url=http://www3.hants.gov.uk/gdc/gosport-dc-local-studies/local-history-online/place-names-of-gosport.htm |last=Eley |first=Philip |title=The Place Names of Gosport, an unofficial portrayal |work=Hantsweb |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081007203501/http://www3.hants.gov.uk/gdc/gosport-dc-local-studies/local-history-online/place-names-of-gosport.htm |archivedate=7 October 2008}}</ref>\n\n==History==\nThe [[Rowner]] area of the peninsula was settled by the [[Anglo-Saxon England|Anglo-Saxon]]s, and is mentioned in the ''[[Anglo Saxon Chronicle]]'' as Rughenor (\"rough bank or slope\"). Both Rowner and [[Alverstoke]], the name coming from the point where the River Alver entered [[the Solent]] at [[Stokes Bay]], were included in the [[Domesday Book]]. [[Rowner]] was the earliest known settlement of the peninsula, with many [[Prehistoric Britain#Mesolithic|Mesolithic]] finds and a hunting camp being found, and [[tumuli]] on the peninsula investigated. [[Bronze Age]] items found in a 1960s construction in {{HMS|Sultan|establishment|6}} included a hoard of axe heads and torcs. A three-celled dwelling unearthed during construction of the Rowner naval Estate in the 1970s points to a settled landscape. Next to the River Alver which passes the southern and western edge of Rowner is a [[Norman England|Norman]] motte and bailey, the first fortification of the peninsula, giving a vantage point over the Solent, [[Stokes Bay]], [[Lee-on-the-Solent]] and the [[Isle of Wight]]. The former Rowner naval married quarters estate, now mostly demolished, and HMS ''Sultan'' were built on a former military airfield, known first as [[RAF Gosport]] and later as HMS ''Siskin'', which gives its name to the local infant and junior schools. The barracks at [[Browndown Battery|Browndown (Stokes Bay)]] were used in the ITV series ''[[Bad Lads' Army]]''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.localhistories.org/gosport.html |last=Lambert |first=Tim |title=A Brief History of Gosport |work=A World History Encyclopedia |accessdate= }}</ref>\n\n== Politics ==\nThe district is currently run by the Gosport Borough Council. Following the 2018 Borough Council elections, the political structure of the Council is as follows:\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+\n!Party\n!Seats\n|-\n|Conservative\n|18\n|-\n|Liberal Democrat\n|14\n|-\n|Labour\n|2\n|}\n\n[[Caroline Dinenage]] currently serves as the [[Conservative Party]] Member of Parliament for Gosport, and has done so since 2010, after gaining a 48.0% majority vote in the [[2010 General Election]].\n\n==Naval and military==\nUntil the last quarter of the 20th century, Gosport was a major naval town associated with the defence and supply infrastructure of [[HMNB Portsmouth|Her Majesty's Naval Base (HMNB) Portsmouth]]. As such over the years extensive fortifications were created.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.gosportsociety.co.uk/towndefences.htm |title=The Gosport Town Defences |website=Gosport Society |accessdate=13 September 2017}}</ref> The first fortifications were in 1678 during the reign on Charles II. These consisted of two forts, Fort James and Fort Charles, and a series of bastions and double ditches to encircle the town, known as the Gosport Lines. During the Georgian period in 1751 and 1752 they were rebuilt, enlarged and extended. Further additions were made in response to the French invasion threat of 1779. By 1860, the Gosport Lines had 58 guns. No.1 Bastion, for example, had mounted 14 guns in brick lined emplacements firing over the parapet. The 1859 Royal Commission on the Defences of the United Kingdom proposed the completion of [[Palmerston Forts, Portsmouth|a line of forts]] to protect the outer approach to Gosport town, making the earlier defences redundant. However, they were retained to constrain any expansion of the town towards the new line of forts. From the 1890s road widening meant some parts of the ramparts and gates were demolished. Further sections were demolished in the 1920s and 1960s. Today, the little that remain are protected ancient monuments.\n\nThe town is still home to {{HMS|Sultan|establishment|6}} and a [[DM Gosport|Naval Armament Supply Facility]] as well as a Helicopter Repair base; however, Gosport's naval history is very long, and the town has several buildings of historic interest as well as connections with many people who became famous. Most of the former naval and military installations have closed since the [[Second World War]], leaving empty sites and buildings. In response to this, museums have opened, and many of the fortifications and installations (such as [[Fort Brockhurst]], [[Priddy's Hard]] (formerly an [[Royal Naval Armaments Depot|Armament Depot]], now the [[Explosion! Museum of Naval Firepower]]) and the [[Royal Navy Submarine Museum]] in Haslar Road) have been opened to the public as tourism and heritage sites. One of the more recent additions is the Diving Museum<ref>{{cite web |title=The Diving Museum |url=http://www.divingmuseum.co.uk |accessdate=2 April 2018}}</ref> at [[Stokes Bay Lines|No 2 Battery at Stokes Bay]] which is bidding to become the National Diving Museum for the British Isles.\n\nSeveral sites have also been redeveloped to provide housing, including the New [[Barracks]] (opened 1859, renamed St George Barracks in 1947, having served as HMS ''St George'' during the Second World War; closed 1991),<ref>{{cite web |title=New Barracks |url=https://www.gosportsociety.co.uk/newbarracks.htm |website=Gosport Society |accessdate=22 September 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161012070951/https://www.gosportsociety.co.uk/newbarracks.htm |archive-date=12 October 2016 |url-status=dead }}</ref> the [[Royal Clarence Yard|Royal Clarence]] [[Victualling Yard]] (opened 1828 on the site of an earlier [[Victualling Commissioners|victualling]] facility, closed 1992) and [[Royal Hospital Haslar]] (formerly the last military hospital of the UK: opened as a [[Royal Naval Hospital]] in 1753, later served other armed forces personnel and latterly the wider community of Gosport; closed as a military hospital in March 2007, the [[National Health Service|NHS]] withdrew in 2009 and the hospital closed). [[Forton Barracks]] (opened 1811, closed 1923, re-opened as {{HMS|St Vincent|Gosport shore establishment|6}} in 1923, closed 1969)<ref>{{cite web |title=Forton Barracks |url=https://www.gosportsociety.co.uk/fortonbarracks.htm |website=Gosport Society |accessdate=22 September 2016}}</ref> was part-demolished and is now [[St Vincent College]].\n\nThere has also been extensive redevelopment of the harbour area as a marina.\n\n====Graves of Turkish sailors 1850\u201351====\nIn November 1850, two ships of the Ottoman Navy, ''Mirat-\u0131 Zafer'' and ''Sirag-i Bahri Birik'', anchored off the Hardway near Gosport. The visit lasted several months and during this time some of the members of the crew contracted cholera and were admitted to Haslar Hospital for treatment, where most of them died. In addition, some other sailors died because of training accidents. In total 26 died and were laid to rest in the grounds of Haslar. At the turn of the 20th century the bodies were exhumed and transferred to the R.N. Military Cemetery, Clayhall Road, in [[Alverstoke]].\n\n====Preparations for the D Day Landings====\n[[File:Allied Preparations For D-day H39000.jpg|thumb|Sherman tanks of the 13th/18th Hussars, embarking onto LCT-610, 3 June 1944]]\nIn the first week of June 1944, tanks, scout cars and wheeled vehicles of the [[Sherbrooke Hussars|Sherbrooke Fusilier Regiment]], [[Canadian Army]] loaded [[Landing craft tank]]s in Gosport. Convoys of vehicles had been carefully concealed from German discovery in the areas further inland, and in daylight on 3 June moved through Titchfield and [[Stubbington]] to G3 Hard on the Gosport waterfront. There, the [[M4 Sherman]] tanks were backed into position in preparation for the Channel crossing. The initial plan was for the invasion to begin on 5 June, but bad weather, with the various vessels riding at anchor off Calshot in the Solent, delayed the plans by one day.<ref>{{cite book |last=Jackson |first=LtCol HM |year=1958 |title=The Sherbrooke Regiment (12th Armoured Regiment) |place= |publisher=privately published |page= }}{{page needed|date=April 2015}}</ref>\n\n====Gallery of historic buildings====\n\n=====Naval=====\n<gallery>\nFile:Royal Naval Hospital Haslar - geograph.org.uk - 593470.jpg|Royal Naval Hospital, Haslar\nFile:St Vincent's College - geograph.org.uk - 1327446.jpg|Forton Barracks (Royal Marine Light Infantry; later [[HMS St Vincent (Gosport shore establishment)|HMS ''St Vincent'']])\nFile:Haslar Road - geograph.org.uk - 877388.jpg|[[Haslar]] Gunboat Yard and Admiralty Experimental Works (perimeter wall)\nFile:Gate to Clarence Yard - geograph.org.uk - 510.jpg|Gate to the Royal Clarence [[Victualling Yard]]\nFile:St Clarence Yard Gate Maintenance.jpg|Gate to the Royal Clarence Victualling Yards under Maintenance, 2019.\nFile:Priddy's Hard Building 2019.jpg|Offices & Storehouse, [[Royal Naval Armaments Depot]], [[Priddy's Hard]] (2019)\n</gallery>\n\n=====Military=====\n<gallery>\nFile:Fort Blockhouse 03.jpg|[[Fort Blockhouse]]\nFile:Moat around Fort Brockhurst (1) - geograph.org.uk - 1038063.jpg|[[Fort Brockhurst]], moat\nFile:Fort Grange-Gosport - geograph.org.uk - 704885.jpg|[[Fort Grange]]\nFile:Fort Rowner-Gosport - geograph.org.uk - 704877.jpg|[[Fort Rowner]], entrance\nFile:St.Georges Barracks - Gosport - geograph.org.uk - 814259.jpg|St George Barracks (Infantry)\nFile:Gosport Barracks geograph-4115962-by-Ben-Brooksbank.jpg|St George Barracks, guardhouse\n</gallery>\n\n==Geography==\nThe Town area of the Borough, including Newtown, consists of the town centre, Stoke Road shopping area, Walpole Park, Royal Clarence Yard and three modern marinas: Royal Clarence, Gosport Marina and Haslar Marina.\n\nSouth of the centre is Haslar Creek, which flows into Portsmouth Harbour near the harbour mouth. The lowest part of Haslar Creek is called Haslar Lake; at its western end, the creek splits into two branches. These are called Workhouse Lake (the northern branch) and Stoke Lake (the southern branch). South East of Stoke Lake and along Gilkicker Point is the area of Clayhall.\n\nWest, Northwest and South of Stoke Lake is the district and village of [[Alverstoke]]. To the west of which is Browndown, where the River Alver flows into The Solent at Stokes Bay. Further west from Browndown point is the district of [[Lee-on-the-Solent]] with the former RNAS ''Daedalus'' which is now home to a hovercraft museum and several marine related businesses, and CEMAST College (Fareham College). It is also used as a base for glider clubs, light aeroplanes, [[Her Majesty's Coastguard|HM Coastguard]] heliport and police aircraft.\n\nIn the west of Gosport is the naval base HMS ''Sultan''. West of HMS ''Sultan'' is the district of Rowner which includes Alver Village.\n\nThere are several districts north, northwest and west of the town centre. These include areas that extend to the inland areas of the peninsula, [[Hardway, Hampshire|Hardway]] (including Priddy's Hard and [[Forton Lake]]) Elson, Brockhurst, Bridgemary and Rowner. Hoeford (A32 Gosport Road) is the most northwesterly area within Gosport, and ends at the boundary with the Borough of [[Borough of Fareham|Fareham]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gosport.gov.uk/onlinemaps/ |title=Online maps |publisher=Gosport.gov.uk |accessdate=29 May 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Climate==\nThe climate of Gosport is milder than that of the surrounding areas, winter frosts being light and short-lived and snow quite rare. Temperatures rarely drop much below freezing, because the peninsula has water to the south and east. Portsdown Hill also protects the town from the cold northerly winds during the winter months. Located on the south coast, Gosport also receives more sunshine per annum than most of the UK. The average maximum temperature in January is 8C with the average minimum being 3C. The average maximum temperature in July is 21C, with the average minimum being 14C. The record high temperature is 32C and record low is -9C.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.tutiempo.net/en/Climate/SOLENT_M_R_S_C/38740.htm |title=Climate Solent M.R.S.C. |work=World Weather |publisher=TuTiempo.net |accessdate=}}</ref><ref>[[Portsmouth|Gosport climate information adapted from Portsmouth climate information.

The [[Gosport Ferry]] provides quick access to [[Portsmouth Harbour railway station]], terminus of the [[Portsmouth Direct Line]] to [[London]]. Due to heavy traffic (see below) this ferry is very well used. At one time the Gosport Ferry Company operated steam ferries, until the arrival in 1966 of two identical (and then very modern) diesel ferries, named ''Gosport Queen'' and ''Portsmouth Queen''. In 1971 a third ferry called ''Solent Enterprise'' joined the fleet. She was a slightly larger, more luxurious version of the \"Queens\". The company now operates two new modern ferries along with the two 1966 veterans. The first was built in 2001 and is named ''Spirit of Gosport''. After the retirement of the ''Solent Enterprise'' in 2003, a second modern and slightly larger ferry was added to the fleet and was named the ''Spirit of Portsmouth''. All ferries have been able to carry cycles and motorcycles.\n\nGosport received its railway before Portsmouth, but it closed to passengers in 1953. In 1841 a railway opened between the [[London and Southampton Railway]] at {{rws|Eastleigh}} via {{rws|Fareham}} to Gosport, where a [[terminal station|terminus]] was built to an [[Italianate]] design of Sir [[William Tite]]. [[Gosport railway station]] was intended to serve Portsmouth across the water, but was sited at Gosport away from the harbour because the railway company was not allowed to breach either the [[Hilsea Lines]], defences at the northern end of [[Portsea Island]] protecting [[Portsmouth]], or the Gosport Lines protecting depots such as Royal Clarence Yard.\n\nAn extension to Royal Clarence Yard was opened in 1846, and branch lines to [[Stokes Bay]] (open from 1863 to 1915), and to [[Lee-on-the-Solent]] (open to passengers 1894 to 1931). Due to declining traffic, the connection to Fareham was closed for passenger services in 1953 and to freight traffic in 1969, although trains to the armament depot in Frater ran until the late 1970s.\n\nThe trackbed of the former Gosport \u2013 Fareham railway is now an exclusive fast bus route and cycle lane. Tite's station building has been retained for its historical and architectural value and has been converted into a small number of residential properties and offices. The main gate in Spring Garden Lane has been opened up for vehicle access. A further development of six terraced homes has been built at the north western end of the site linking with George Street.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hermitage-housing.co.uk/page.asp?id=349 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120802023136/http://www.hermitage-housing.co.uk/page.asp?id=349 |url-status=dead |archive-date=2 August 2012 |title=Gosport Railway |publisher=[[The Guinness Partnership|Hermitage Housing Association]]}}</ref>\n\nBeing a peninsula town without a railway system, Gosport relies heavily upon the major [[A32 road]] in and out of the town. Plans existed in the 1970s to widen the road to accommodate expected increases in traffic flow, but this did not take place. In the early 1990s a computerised system controlling traffic lights along the route was installed to improve the rate of flow of traffic but this failed to work and had to be switched off since it could not cope with the traffic volumes. Now, in the 21st century, the A32 is much the same as it was thirty years ago{{when|date=August 2019}} and the traffic using it has increased to such an extent that the journey time to the nearby M27, about {{convert|5|mi|0}}, can routinely take anything from 45 minutes and often longer at peak times between 07:30 & 09:00 and 16:00 & 18:30.\n\nThe station site was linked with the [[South Hampshire Rapid Transit]] scheme, which would have made use of the former railway route.

The [[United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee]] (USOPC) is the [[National Olympic Committee]] for the United States.\n\nAmerican athletes have won a total of 2,522 medals (1,022 of them gold) at the [[Summer Olympic Games]] and another 305 at the [[Winter Olympic Games]], making the United States the most prolific medal-winning nation in the history of the Olympics. The US is ranked first in the all-time medal table even if [[All-time Olympic Games medal table#Combined total|all the incarnations of Russia and Germany are combined]], leading the second-placed Russians by 402 gold and 917 total medals. These achievements are even more impressive considering the fact that the American Olympic team remains the only in the world to receive no government funding.<ref>https://www.teamusa.org/about-the-usoc</ref>\n\nThe United States made its Olympic debut in 1896, when [[Athens]] hosted the very first [[1896 Summer Olympics|edition]] of the modern games. The nation performed inconsistently in the pre-[[World War I|WW1]] period primarily due to fielding considerably less athletes than hosting countries, with the exception being the [[1904 Summer Olympics|1904 Olympics]] in [[St. Louis]], [[Missouri]], where the US achieved its greatest medal haul in history, a record that still stands today. In the [[interwar period]], America enjoyed its most successful spell, topping both gold and total medal counts at four straight Summer Games, before falling short in [[1936 Summer Olympics|1936]], when [[Berlin]] hosted the games, and [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] used the event to push its political agenda. The next Olympics were held only in [[1948 Summer Olympics|1948]] when [[World War II|WW2]] hostilities ended. By this time, Germany was no longer a competitor to the US, with its places being taken by the [[Soviet Union at the Olympics|Soviet Union]], which went even further than the Germans and used the Olympics with a specific goal of pushing its ideological agenda. The Soviets clearly wanted to overtake the United States as a leading Olympic power and used any means they deemed necessary, including the use of professional athletes, something that was prohibited back then, and running a comprehensive state-sponsored doping program. The USSR ultimately achieved its goal, and after 20 years of fierce competition, it utterly thrashed America at the [[1972 Summer Olympics]] in [[Munich]]. After that, the US would not top a medal table in a non-boycotted games until [[1996 Summer Olympics]], five years after the USSR [[Fall of the Soviet Union|collapsed]]. The 1970s and 1980s, therefore, became a dark moment for American Olympic teams, as they significantly fell behind not only the Soviet Union, but also [[East Germany at the Olympics|East Germany]], USSR's [[satellite state]]. The only bright spot was the [[1984 Summer Olympics|1984 Games]] in [[Los Angeles]] where the United States set a record for most gold medals won in a single Olympics, 83, primarily due to the [[1984 Summer Olympics boycott|Soviet-led boycott]]. In the 1990s the situation started improving, and the US returned to the leading positions in the Summer Olympics, topping the medal table five times since 1992 and placing second on two occasions. \n\n== Hosted Games ==\nThe United States has hosted the Games on '''eight''' occasions, more than any other nation, and is planning to host the '''ninth''':\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The hosts, on the other hand, had 169 athletes competing and won 46 medals. The American team did its best, but managed to grab only 20 medals, being dwarfed by an enormous Greek team. However, the United States managed to get the most gold medals, 11, edging Greece that secured 10 golds. That allowed Team USA to finish first in the gold medal tally. [[James Brendan Connolly|James Connolly]] became the first modern Olympic champion by winning the [[Athletics at the 1896 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's triple jump|triple jump]], and [[Thomas Burke (athlete)|Thomas Burke]] grabbed three gold medals in various track events, assuming the title of the most successful athlete of the 1896 Games.<ref>https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/countries/USA/summer/1896/</ref>\n\n[[File:Margaret-abbott-gold-medal-1900-golf.jpg|thumb|left|[[Margaret Abbott]] competing in golf]]\nAt the [[1900 Summer Olympics|1900 Paris Olympics]], the US team featured 75 athletes, a significant increase compared to 1896, but still considerably less than the French hosts that fielded 720 competitors. The most notable of all American participants was [[Margaret Abbott]] who became the first female American Olympic champion by winning the [[Golf at the 1900 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's individual|women's golf]]. The vast majority of American medals were won in the sport of [[Athletics at the 1900 Summer Olympics|athletics]] where US athletes clinched 16 gold and 39 medals overall. Team USA won only 8 medals outside of track, four of them in golf. Overall, France dominated the medal standings, winning 29 gold and 112 total medals. The United States ranked second with 19 and 48, respectively, showing great efficiency, despite having significantly less athletes.<ref>https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/countries/USA/summer/1900/</ref>\n\n[[File:Francis Field 1904.jpg|thumb|[[Francis Olympic Field]] of [[Washington University in St. Louis]], site of the [[1904 Summer Olympics|1904 Olympics Games]]]]\nThe [[1904 Summer Olympics]] in [[St. Louis]], [[Missouri]] were the first ever Olympic Games held outside of Europe.\n\n===Interwar period (1920\u20131936)===\n\n===Cold War era (1948\u20131992)===\n[[File:Bob Mathias 1952.jpg|200px|left|thumb|[[Bob Mathias]] became the star of the [[1948 Summer Olympics|1948 London games]] by winning the [[Athletics at the 1948 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's decathlon|decathlon]] event at the age of 17. He would go on to repeat this feat at the [[Athletics at the 1952 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's decathlon|1952 Olympics]] in [[Helsinki]], setting a new world record.]]\nThe [[1948 Summer Olympics|1948 London Olympics]] marked the first time that the newly communist countries, that were occupied by the [[Soviet Union]] after [[World War Two|WW2]], competed in the games. The Soviets themselves declined to compete, sending only observers, after a long hesitation that saw Soviet leader [[Joseph Stalin]] demanding guarantees from his sports officials that the USSR would beat the US in the medal standings. The Soviet officials told him that chances were 50/50, and Stalin ultimately rejected the idea of competing in 1948. With its newest political rival absent, the United States comfortably dominated the games, winning 38 gold and 84 total medals, 22 gold and 40 total medals more than the runner-up [[Sweden at the 1948 Summer Olympics|Sweden]]. The most medals were won in track and field, 27, and swimming, 15. The [[1948 United States men's Olympic basketball team|US basketball team]] won its second consecutive gold medal, defeating [[France men's national basketball team|France]] in the final, 65\u201321.<ref>https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/countries/USA/summer/1948/</ref>\n\n[[File:USA-USSR.jpg|200px|right|thumb|Gold medal game in basketball at the [[Basketball at the 1952 Summer Olympics|1952 Olympics]] between the [[United States men's national basketball team|US]] and the [[Soviet Union men's national basketball team|USSR]]. The Americans won, 36-25.]]\nIn [[1952 Summer Olympics|1952]], [[Helsinki]] saw the Soviets sending a team for the first time. This was a beginning of a new era, as the Soviet Union would go on to dominate the Olympics for the next four decades. The Soviets viewed the Olympics as international battlefield, where they can achieve their political goals by winning medals, thus proving their system\u2019s superiority.<ref>http://blogs.bu.edu/guidedhistory/russia-and-its-empires/tyler-benson/</ref><ref>www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP80-00810A005600130009-0.pdf</ref> The Soviet authorities also significantly bent the amateur rules, that were in place at the time, by providing state-funding to their athletes who trained full-time and, unlike American self-financed amateurs, were ''[[de facto]]'' professionals. That would start a significant controversy, that will result in the amateur rules being abolished, though only in the 1990s, after the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]], meaning that the Soviets benefited from those rules throughout their Olympic history.<ref>http://www.processhistory.org/redihan-1952-olympics/</ref> The United States still topped the medal count at these games, winning 40 gold and 76 total medals, 22 gold and 5 total medals more than the [[Soviet Union at the 1952 Summer Olympics|Soviets]] who finished second. American athletes won 31 medals in track and field, their most successful sport. [[1952 United States men's Olympic basketball team|US basketball team]] won its third consecutive gold, twice defeating the Soviets in the process, American boxers won all five finals they entered, and American weightlifters edged their Soviet rivals 4 to 3 in terms of gold medals, with the two nations sweeping all seven events in the sport.<ref>https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/countries/USA/summer/1952/</ref>\n\n[[File:Bobby Morrow with wife 1956.jpg|200px|right|thumb|[[Bobby Morrow]] won gold in 100 meters, 200 meters, and 4x100 meters relay (track and field) at the [[Athletics at the 1956 Summer Olympics|1956 Summer Olympics]] in [[Melbourne]].]]\n[[Melbourne]] hosted the Olympics in [[1956 Summer Olympics|1956]]. There were calls for the expulsion of the Soviet Union following their [[Soviet invasion of Hungary|invasion of Hungary]], but the [[International Olympic Committee]] decided not to pursue any action. As a result, some nations boycotted the games in protest of the Soviets' presence, and the Hungarians themselves became engaged in a violent brawl with their Soviet counterparts in a water polo game, an event that was instantly called [[Blood in the Water match|Blood in the Water]]. The US performance at the games was relatively successful, though it was getting harder and harder to compete with the Soviet machine. As a result, the Americans earned 32 gold and 78 total medals (second place in the medal standings), 5 gold and 24 total medals less than the first-placed Soviets. The US contingent was particularly successful in track and field, where American athletes amassed 31 medals. On the other hand, the US won only 2 golds in swimming, being unable to stop the Australian domination of the swimming events at these games. In weightlifting, the Americans and Soviets once again won all seven events, once again with a 4 to 3 ratio in favor of the US team. In boxing, the Soviets won 3 golds, while the Americans only managed to win two events. However, it was gymnastics where the USSR achieved its greatest success, winning 11 out of 17 events and guaranteeing the first place in the medal rankings. The [[1956 United States men's Olympic basketball team|US basketball team]] won its fourth consecutive gold, beating the Soviets in the final game, 89\u201355.<ref>https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/countries/USA/summer/1956/</ref>\n\n[[File:Giuseppina leone.jpg|260px|left|thumb|[[Wilma Rudolph]] became the first woman in history to sweep 100 meters, 200 meters, and 4x100 meters relay at the [[Athletics at the 1960 Summer Olympics|1960 Rome Games]].]]\nThe [[1960 Summer Olympics|1960 Rome Olympics]] saw the Americans losing their grip on their traditionally successful sports, such as track and field and weightlifting. On the other hand, boxing, swimming (where the Americans won 9 gold medals, while being controversially denied gold in the [[Swimming at the 1960 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's 100 metre freestyle|100 meters freestyle]], despite showing the best time), and wrestling produced unexpectedly good results, which somewhat helped to compensate for what was lost in other sports. In track and field, the Soviets won 11 golds, only one less that the Americans. It is worth mentioning that the US team encountered many problems throughout the meet, such as a controversial disqualification of their gold medal winning [[Athletics at the 1960 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's 4 \u00d7 100 metres relay|men's 4x100 relay team]]. In weightlifting, the Soviets, with the help of their state-of-the-art doping program, won five out of seven events, leaving the US with only one gold. 10 Soviet golds in gymnastics didn't surprise anyone, as the nation had always been a gymnastics powerhouse, but it did mean that the Soviets beat the Americans in the medal standings for the second straight summer games. The [[1960 United States men's Olympic basketball team|US basketball team]], however, met the pre-tournament expectations and won its fifth consecutive gold medal, a noble feat, given that they had to compete against veteran pros from the USSR. The final result, 43 gold and 103 total medals for the Soviets to 34 gold and 71 total medals for the Americans, showed that America was no longer a leading force in Olympic competition.<ref>https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/countries/USA/summer/1960/</ref>\n\n[[File:Don Schollander 1964.jpg|200px|left|thumb|[[Don Schollander]] won 4 golds in swimming at the [[Swimming at the 1964 Summer Olympics|1964 games]] in [[Tokyo]], the largest individual medal haul in a single Olympics since [[Jesse Owens]] in 1936.]]\nThere was some redemption for the US at the [[1964 Summer Olympics]] in [[Tokyo]], as the nation returned to the top of the [[1964 Summer Olympics medal table|gold medal count]] for the first time since 1952. Particularly successful was the US swimming team that won 13 out of available 18 golds and shattered 9 world records. In track and field, the Americans also improved on their 1960 performance, winning 14 gold and 24 total medals, while the Soviets left Japan with 5 gold and 18 total medals, a significant downturn compared to their 1960 results. The Soviets, however, continued to dominate Olympic weightlifting, and, with the American program falling apart, the USSR produced four golds and three silvers. The Soviet Union hoped to replicate that success in gymnastics and wrestling, the sports that, together with weightlifting, were strongly associated with their athletic prowess. However, they encountered a zealous resistance from the Japanese, who used their [[home advantage|home-field advantage]] to stun the Soviets, beating them five to three in wrestling golds, and winning five gymnastics championships to their four. Thus, Japan had a major influence on the US\u2013USSR medals race, and most certainly helped the Americans edge their biggest rivals, while also managing to produce its best ever medal output and finishing in third place. For the Americans, despite their dismal performance in boxing where they achieved only one gold, the 1964 Olympics were a definite success, with the nation winning 36 gold and 90 total medals compared to the Soviet tally of 30 gold and 96 total medals. Therefore, the US topped the gold medal count, finishing second in the total medal count, while the USSR topped the total medal count, finishing second in the gold medal count. The [[1964 United States men's Olympic basketball team|US basketball team]] won its sixth consecutive gold, beating the Soviets in the final, 73\u201359.<ref>https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/countries/USA/summer/1964/</ref>\n\n[[File:Bob Beamon 1968.jpg|200px|right|thumb|There were many historic achievements at the [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968 Mexico City Olympics]] but, perhaps, the most significant among them was [[Bob Beamon]]'s performance in the [[Athletics at the 1968 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's long jump|long jump]], where he improved the world record by 55 cm.]]\nThe [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968 Mexico Olympics]] became the most successful summer games for the US in the post-war era. American athletes amassed 45 gold and 107 total medals, 16 gold and 16 total medals more than the second-placed Soviets. The US swimming team dominated the competition, winning a staggering 51 medals and sweeping the podium on five occasions. The Americans also managed to medal in every single of 29 swimming events, thus achieving a unique feat. The US track and field team pulled off a stellar performance as well with 15 gold and 28 total medals. Overall, swimming and athletics accounted for more than 70% of all US medals, and ensured the first place in the medal table for the Americans, their second consecutive first-place finish in terms of gold medals, and their first finish at the top of the overall medal table since 1952. In other sports, however, the performance of American athletes was less convincing. The US weightlifting team continued to fade away, winning just one medal (compared to 7 in 1956), American boxers won 7 medals, though only two of them gold, US divers won 6 medals, and the men's volleyball team managed to stun the defending champions from the Soviet Union, beating them in five sets, but still finished out of medals; Soviets ultimately won gold, with their lone loss being to the US. In gymnastics, Japan continued to frustrate the Soviets, once again surpassing them in the medal standings. Last but not least, the [[1968 United States men's Olympic basketball team|US basketball team]] won its seventh consecutive gold medal, a feat not matched by any other Olympic team in ball sports. Very few would have assumed that this was the last time that the US finished first in the medal table in a fully attended Summer Olympics until 1996 (the Americans would top the medal standings in 1984 with the Soviet Union and its satellites boycotting).<ref>https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/countries/USA/summer/1968/</ref>\n\nThe [[1972 Summer Olympics|Munich Olympics]] saw the Soviet Union begin its streak of topping the medal count at five consecutive summer games in which they participated (1972\u20131992, though in 1992 they would compete as the ''[[Unified Team at the 1992 Summer Olympics|Unified Team]]'' as the USSR [[Fall of the Soviet Union|dissolved]] half a year prior to the games, and the newly independent countries decided to compete together). The sporting nature of the event was largely overshadowed by the [[Munich massacre]] in the second week, in which eleven [[Israel]]i [[Israel at the 1972 Summer Olympics|athletes and coaches]] and a West German police officer at Olympic village were killed by [[Black September Organization|Black September]] terrorists. There were multiple calls to cancel the games after the terrorist attack, but the IOC declined. From a sporting standpoint, these games were one of the most controversial in history, with many accusing the organizing committee of anti-Americanism and trying to appease the Soviet Union and East Germany. Indeed, these were one the strangest Olympics ever for American athletes. US world record holders in the [[Athletics at the 1972 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's 100 metres|100 meters]] were given the wrong starting time and were unable to compete in the event, thus paving the way for a Soviet to win. In swimming, the US gold medal winner in the [[Swimming at the 1972 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's 400 metre freestyle|400 meters freestyle]] was stripped of his medal for using his prescription asthma medication, also depriving him of a chance at multiple medals. US boxers complained that they were judged unfairly in the bouts against their communist counterparts. In shooting, a US athlete initially won the [[Shooting at the 1972 Summer Olympics \u2013 Mixed 50 metre rifle, prone|50 meters rifle]] only to be relegated to silver after a \"review\". Finally, in the most controversial event of the games, and one of the most controversial events of all time, the [[1972 United States men's Olympic basketball team|US basketball team]] was denied gold after apparently winning the final match against the Soviet Union. The final three seconds of the game were replayed three times until the Soviets came out on top. The Americans did not accept the silver medals, believing that they were robbed. This was the first US loss in Olympic basketball history and it ended the Americans' 63-game winning streak in Olympic basketball. In general, the US team greatly underperformed at these games, winning only 6 gold medals in track and field to the East Germans' 8 and Soviets' 9, though the Americans still won the most total medals, 22. In boxing, the Cubans and Soviets dominated, winning three and two championships, respectively, while the US won only one gold and four medals overall (compared to the Soviets' two and Cubans' five). In diving, the Americans won three medals; in soccer, the USSR and GDR fixed a bronze medal game, playing a tie, so both teams received bronze; in gymnastics, the Soviets edged their old rivals Japan to top the medal count; in weightlifting, the Soviets and Bulgarians won three golds each; in wrestling, the US team surprised with three golds in freestyle, yet the Soviets still dwarfed their medal tally with nine golds in freestyle and greco-roman (14\u20136 in total medals). In water polo, the Americans struck bronze, tying the eventual gold medalists the Soviet Union in the final round. Swimming was the only sport where the American team did not disappoint, winning 17 gold and 43 total medals, a good result, but still less than four years earlier. American women dominated swimming for the last time until 1992, as by 1976 they would be overtaken by East German [[Doping in East Germany|dopers]].<ref>https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/countries/USA/summer/1972/</ref>\n\nThe Eastern Bloc utterly dominated the [[1976 Summer Olympics|1976 Montreal Olympics]], with seven communist countries placing in the top ten of the medal table. The United States team was relegated to a third place in the medal standings for the first time in its history, courtesy of Soviet and East German doping systems and their use of professional athletes. This was the Olympics of contrasts: the US men's swimming team, despite a generally dismal showing of the delegation, completely obliterated their sport, sweeping 12 gold and 27 total medals in the 13 events that were on the program and shattering 11 world records in the process (this was arguably the most dominant performance of any swimming team in history),<ref>https://www.indystar.com/story/sports/2016/07/31/docs-boys-story-dominant-us-swim-team-1976/87614856/</ref> while the US women's swimming team, on the other hand, fell victim to the unbeatable East German dopers. They still managed to win a gold medal, in a shocking upset against East Germans in the [[Swimming at the 1976 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's 4 \u00d7 100 metre freestyle relay|4x100 freestyle relay]]. The event was held on the last day of the swimming program, and the American women were risking to get shut out of gold for the first time in the US Olympic history. The victory was somewhat overlooked at the time, but since the early 1990s, when the crimes of the Soviet Bloc started to unravel, their gold medal is often considered to be one of the most improbable and heroic upsets of all time.<ref>https://www.dailynews.com/2016/06/04/40-years-later-story-of-us-east-german-olympic-swimmers-can-be-told-best-in-the-last-gold/</ref> In track and field, both the US men's and women's team were overwhelmed by East Germans who, as their Soviet masters expected, stole away a bulk of medals from the US in its signature sports, thus allowing the Soviets to win the medal table virtually unchallenged. The US boxing team surprised everyone, advancing to six gold medal bouts and winning five of them, drawing parallels to a stellar 1952 team that also took 5 golds. The achievement was even more momentous due to the fact that the American boxers were significantly younger and less experienced than their Cuban and Soviet counterparts.<ref>https://www.espn.com/boxing/story/_/id/15293108/1976-us-olympic-boxing-team-celebrate-40-year-reunion-boxing-hall-fame-banquet-champions</ref> In other sports, US divers won 5 medals, including two golds; the US equestrian team took home 4 medals; American shooters won three medals, including a historic silver by a woman in the [[Shooting at the 1976 Summer Olympics \u2013 Mixed 50 metre rifle three positions|mixed 50 meters rifle three positions]]; US freestyle wrestlers advanced to four gold medal bouts, yet won only one of them (all four were against the Soviets), concluding the meet with 6 medals overall. The [[1976 United States men's Olympic basketball team|US men's basketball team]] reclaimed the gold medal, while the [[United States women's national basketball team|women's team]] won a surprising silver, being ranked no higher than sixth prior to the start of the tournament. The Soviets and East Germans were unstoppable in canoeing, gymnastics, rowing, weightlifting and wrestling, going 1\u20132 in the medal standings (49 gold and 125 total medals for the Soviets, and 40 gold and 90 total medals for East Germans). The US won medals in 14 sports, finishing third with 34 gold and 94 total medals. The most successful day for the Americans was July 31st when they won 8 gold and 18 total medals.<ref>https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/countries/USA/summer/1976/</ref>\n\nThe [[1980 Summer Olympics]] marked another first for the United States, as the nation led by far the largest and most significant [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|boycott]] in the Olympic history. The boycott was motivated by the [[1979 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]], as well as by flagrant human rights violations in the USSR, and the regime's [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitic]] policies.<ref>U. Tulli, \"Bringing Human Rights In: The Campaign Against the 1980 Moscow Olympic Games and the Origins of the Nexus Between Human Rights and the Olympic Games\", in The International Journal of the History of Sport, Vol.33, Issue 16 (2016-2017) https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09523367.2017.1315104</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://2001-2009.state.gov/r/pa/ho/time/qfp/104481.htm|title=The Olympic Boycott, 1980|work=U.S. Department of State Archive}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/packages/html/sports/year_in_sports/01.20.html|title=The President Said Nyet|work=The New York Times|author=Smith, Terence|date=January 20, 1980}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.csmonitor.com/1980/0415/041531.html|title=How the Russians break the Olympic rules|publisher=[[The Christian Science Monitor]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/14/sports/olympics/soviet-doping-plan-russia-rio-games.html?_r=0|title=The Soviet Doping Plan: Document Reveals Illicit Approach to '84 Olympics|work=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref> The Soviet state-run media ridiculed the Americans as sore losers who couldn't get over the fact that they were no longer a perennial Olympic power, and simply didn't want to be embarrassed by the Soviets who would thrash them in the medal count. Indeed, all medal predictions pointed to an inevitable Soviet victory with 55\u201360 gold medals. East Germans were forecast to win 40\u201345 gold medals, while the Americans would wind up in third place with 30\u201335 golds. However, the world will never know what would have happened, as the United States and 65 other countries chose not to attend the Moscow Games, leaving them with the smallest attendance since 1956. Predictably, the great majority of the medals were taken by the [[Soviet Union at the 1980 Summer Olympics|host country]] and [[East Germany at the 1980 Summer Olympics|East Germany]] in what was the most skewed medal tally since [[1904 Summer Olympics|1904]].<ref>Moscow 1980 Olympic Games. Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online Library Edition: http://www.library.ebonline.com/eb/article-9098213</ref> The Soviets amassed 80 gold (all-time record) and 195 total (second-best result after the US in 1904) medals in their anticlimactic performance.<ref>https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/summer/1980/</ref>\n\nIn [[1984 Summer Olympics|1984]], [[Los Angeles]] witnessed what was considered a retaliatory boycott by the Soviets and their satellites, although the Soviets cited security concerns and \"chauvinistic sentiments and an anti-Soviet hysteria being whipped up in the United States.\" However, no threat to Eastern Bloc athletes was ever discovered, and the athletes from the Eastern Bloc country that did attend the 1984 games in Los Angeles&mdash;Romania&mdash;encountered no problems, and in fact were widely cheered above all other visiting nations at the Opening Ceremonies when they marched into the Coliseum (Romania ended up finishing third in overall medal count at the Games). The move by the Soviets left many \"dumbfounded\", as it was expected that they would try to thrash the US on their soil, thus achieving a significant propaganda victory. The forecasts again heavily favored the Soviet Union, with the Soviet athletes being expected to rack up 60\u201365 gold medals compared to 35\u201345 by the second-placed Americans. That didn't happen. Furthermore, despite the Soviet boycott, a record 140 nations (including China that participated for the first time since 1952) attended the games.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jimrome.com/2017/11/15/bryan-fogel-talks-1984-summer-olympics-boycott-on-the-jim-rome-podcast/|website=jimrome.com|title=Bryan Fogel talks 1984 Summer Olympics boycott on The Jim Rome Podcast|access-date=November 23, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171122112500/http://jimrome.com/2017/11/15/bryan-fogel-talks-1984-summer-olympics-boycott-on-the-jim-rome-podcast/|archive-date=November 22, 2017|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nThere were fears that the Soviet Union would boycott the [[1988 Summer Olympics]] in [[Seoul]] as well because [[South Korea]] had no diplomatic relations with the USSR, which recognised and supported only [[North Korea]]. However, the policies of [[Perestroika]] that were initiated by [[Mikhail Gorbachev|Gorbachev]] in 1985 led to the Soviet participation in the games. [[Cuba at the Summer Olympics|Cuba]], clearly not understanding such a betrayal, decided to boycott the Olympics on its own, impacting the boxing field as a result. The Soviet Union was steadily moving towards its ultimate [[Collapse of the Soviet Union|collapse]] but its sporting empire was still in its prime. The Soviets and their close allies from East Germany utterly dominated the games, winning 55 and 37 gold medals respectively (132 and 102 total medals). \n\nDuring the [[Cold War]] period The Americans did their best to challenge the Soviets, but the playing field wasn't level. The Soviet athletes were funded by the state and trained full-time, while the US strictly obeyed the amateur rules and its athletes were primarily self-financed students who were significantly younger and less experienced than the Soviet veterans. In addition to that, the Soviets developed a state-sponsored doping system, and supplied performance-enhancing drugs to the vast majority of their athletes.<ref>https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/14/sports/olympics/soviet-doping-plan-russia-rio-games.html</ref> Furthermore, they heavily invested in the development of a similar system in their satellite nation, [[East Germany at the Olympics|East Germany]], with a specific goal of making East Germans highly competitive in swimming and track and field, so that they can reduce the number of medals the Americans win in their signature sports. Unfortunately for the US, the Soviet strategy worked, and the gap between the USSR and US widened every four years until the collapse of the Soviet Union. In 1972, the Soviets won 50 gold and 99 total medals to the Americans' 33 and 94; in 1976, the USSR amassed 49 gold and 125 total medals to the Americans' 34 and 94; 1980 Olympics were boycotted by the US and its allies, the Soviets retaliated in 1984 by boycotting the LA Olympics together with their satellites; finally, in 1988, the USSR won 55 gold and 132 total medals to the Americans' 36 and 94 (the US finished third at those games, losing even to the East Germans). In 1992, the Soviets still fielded a team despite the dissolution of their state, yet the margin of their victory over the Americans became narrower: 45 gold and 112 total medals to the Americans' 37 and 108. By 1996, every former Soviet republic formed its own [[National Olympic Committee]], and the countries participated as independent nations, with Russia assuming the Soviet place in the IOC and inheriting Soviet achievements as by far the largest of the former Soviet republics. So, in 1996, the Americans finally managed to return to the top spot in the medal rankings, winning 44 gold and 101 total medals compared to 26 gold and 63 total medals won by the second-placed Russians, thanks to the partial abolition of the amateur rules in the early 1990s (the American athletes still weren't state-sponsored, unlike their foreign counterparts, but they were now eligible for prize money and sponsorships). They were still disadvantaged by these rules in those sports where they weren't abolished (i.e. boxing, baseball, where Cubans continued to field state-sponsored pros against American amateurs), but the situation started improving.\n\n===Modern period (1994\u2013present)===\n{{Expand section|date=February 2020}}\n\n==Amateurism and professionalism==\nThe exclusion of professionals caused several controversies throughout the history of the modern Olympics. The [[1912 Summer Olympics|1912 Olympic]] [[pentathlon]] and [[decathlon]] champion [[Jim Thorpe]] was stripped of his medals when it was discovered that he had played semi-professional baseball before the Olympics. His medals were posthumously restored by the [[International Olympic Committee|IOC]] in 1983 on compassionate grounds.<ref>{{cite web |title=Jim Thorpe Biography |publisher=Biography.com |url=http://www.biography.com/search/article.do?id=9507017 |accessdate=9 February 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe advent of the state-sponsored \"full-time amateur athlete\" of the [[Eastern Bloc]] countries eroded the ideology of the pure [[amateur sports#Olympics|amateur]], as it put the self-financed amateurs of the Western countries at a disadvantage. The [[Soviet Union at the Olympics|Soviet Union]] entered teams of athletes who were all nominally students, soldiers, or working in a profession, but all of whom were in reality paid by the state to train on a full-time basis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.bu.edu/guidedhistory/russia-and-its-empires/tyler-benson/|title=The Role of Sports in The Soviet Union - Guided History|website=blogs.bu.edu}}</ref><ref name=\"cia.gov\">{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP80-00810A005600130009-0.pdf |title=Info |website=www.cia.gov }}</ref><ref name=\"cia.gov\"/> The situation greatly disadvantaged American athletes, and was a major factor in the decline of American medal hauls in the 1970s and 1980s. As a result, the Olympics shifted away from [[Amateur sports|amateurism]], as envisioned by [[Pierre de Coubertin]], to allowing participation of [[professional athlete]]s, but only in the 1990s, after the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]] and its influence within the [[International Olympic Committee]].\n\n==Russia\u2013United States rivalry==\n[[Russia]] (in all its incarnations) and the [[United States]] have won more Olympic medals than any other nation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.statista.com/statistics/262864/all-time-summer-olympics-medals-table/|title=All-time Summer Olympics medals table 1896-2016 &#124; Statistic|website=Statista}}</ref> Russia topped the [[All-time Olympic Games medal table|overall medal count]] at 7 Summer Olympics and 9 Winter Olympics, while the United States placed first at 17 Summer Olympics and 1 Winter Olympics.

The U.S. men's team was considered a favorite in the run-up to the 1972 Games. Since the first Olympic basketball tournament at the [[Basketball at the 1936 Summer Olympics|1936 Olympics]] in [[Berlin]], the Americans haven't lost a single game, winning seven consecutive gold medals in a dominating fashion. Their record reached an unprecedented 63-0 before the final game. Since the [[Basketball at the 1952 Summer Olympics|1952 tournament]] the Soviet team challenged the Americans, winning silver in 1952, [[Basketball at the 1956 Summer Olympics|1956]], [[Basketball at the 1960 Summer Olympics|1960]], [[Basketball at the 1964 Summer Olympics|1964]] and bronze in [[Basketball at the 1968 Summer Olympics|1968]]. Outside of the Olympics, the Soviets had already defeated the U.S. team in the [[FIBA World Cup|World Championship]] play. However, the Americans never sent their best collegiate players to that tournament. \n\nIt is important to note that the Olympics strictly prohibited any involvement of professional athletes at the time. The Soviet Union and other [[Eastern Bloc]] countries used that rule to their advantage, listing all its top players as soldiers or workers what allowed them to breach the amateur rules. Western experts classified these athletes as professionals.<ref name=\"a1972\">{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/classic/s/Classic_1972_usa_ussr_gold_medal_hoop.html|title=Classic 1972 USA vs. USSR Basketball game|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=August 6, 2004|accessdate=April 13, 2009}}</ref> On the other hand, leading American players were unable to play in the Olympics as they were officially professional and played in the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]]. That disadvantage hadn't prevented the Americans from winning the first seven Olympic basketball tournaments without a single defeat.\n\nThe confrontation of the Soviet Union and United States on the [[basketball court]] was deeply connected to the confrontation on the political front. Many American viewers assumed that 1972 Games were openly [[Anti-Americanism|anti-American]].<ref name=espn1>''By Frank Saraceno''.

[http://www.la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/JSH/JSH2002/JSH2903/jsh2903ag.pdf \u00ab03 Seconds From Gold\u00bb (2002).] \u00abJournal of Sports History\u00bb (vol 29, issue 3, page 518\u2014522) // la84foundation.org</ref>\n\nThe [[1972 United States men's Olympic basketball team|United States team]] was the youngest in history. American players usually participated in the Olympics once before turning pro, and the U.S. team always had new players every four years. The 1972 team didn't have a clear leader. A rising star [[Bill Walton]] declined an invitation to participate. Nevertheless, the team was heavily favored featuring such players as [[Doug Collins (basketball)|Doug Collins]] or [[Tommy Burleson]] (the tallest player among all teams).\n\nThe young American team was confronted by a veteran Soviet team, featuring stars [[Sergei Belov]], [[Modestas Paulauskas]], and [[Alexander Belov]]. The players had played together for more than seven years. For [[Gennadi Volnov]] it was the fourth Olympic appearance.\n\nThe Soviets performed strongly at the beginning, winning the first half 26:21. The Soviets kept the Americans 4\u20138 points behind during the first half.\n\nIn the second half Soviets targeted [[Dwight Jones (basketball)|Dwight Jones]], as they considered him the leader of the U.S. team. On the 28th minute he was provoked by [[Mikheil Korkia]] and responded. Both players were sent off. The Soviets were satisfied, as they deemed Korkia less significant for them than Jones for the Americans. The next minute Alexander Belov hit [[Jim Brewer (basketball)|Jim Brewer]] during the free-throw, and Brewer was unable to continue playing. According to the Americans, the referees did not notice the foul.\n\nWith 10 minutes left, the Soviets increased their lead to 10 points. After that Americans finally started to press the Soviets. It helped them to cut the deficit to 1 point. Soviet players started to feel nervous. With less than a minute left, [[Doug Collins (basketball)|Doug Collins]] stole a Soviet pass at halfcourt and was fouled hard by [[Zurab Sakandelidze]] as he drove toward the basket, being knocked down into the basket stanchion. With three seconds remaining on the game clock, Collins was awarded two free throws and sank the first to tie the score at 49. Just as Collins lifted the ball to begin his shooting motion in attempting the second free throw, the horn from the scorer's table sounded, marking the beginning of a chain of events that left the game's final three seconds mired in controversy. Although the unexpected sound of the horn caused lead referee [[Renato Righetto]] to turn away from the free throw attempt and look over to the scorer's table, play was not stopped. Collins never broke his shooting motion and continued with his second free throw, scoring to put the U.S. ahead by a score of 50:49. Immediately following Collins' free throws, the Soviets inbounded the ball and failed to score. Soviet coaches claimed that they had requested a timeout before Collins' foul shots. The referees ordered the clock reset to three seconds and the game's final seconds replayed. The horn sounded as a length-of-the-court Soviet pass was being released from the inbounding player, the pass missed its mark, and the American players began celebrating. Nevertheless, final three seconds were replayed for a third time. This time, the Soviets' [[Alexander Belov]] and the USA's [[Kevin Joyce (basketball)|Kevin Joyce]] and [[James Forbes (basketball)|Jim Forbes]] went up for the pass, and Belov caught the long pass from Ivan Edeshko near the American basket. Belov then laid the ball in for the winning points as the buzzer sounded.\n\nThe Americans regained the basketball crown in [[Basketball at the 1976 Summer Olympics|1976]], but their ability to stay competitive with college players against seasoned professionals from the Soviet Union was decreasing. In [[Basketball at the 1988 Summer Olympics|1988]], the Soviets beat the United States once again, eliminating them in the semifinals. That game was a turning point in international basketball, as [[FIBA]] officials started to realize that amateur rules were extremely unfair. In 1989, NBA players were finally allowed in the Olympics.\n\n===Ice hockey===\n{{see also|Miracle on Ice}}\n[[File:TeamUSA1980 stamp.png|thumb|upright|alt=Beige postage stamp featuring a brightly colored hockey player|Paraguayan stamp featuring U.S. vs USSR matchup.]]\nThe 1980 hockey game between the U.S. and USSR was dubbed the \"[[Miracle on Ice]]\", when American college players defeated the heavily favored seasoned professionals from the [[Soviet Union national ice hockey team|Soviet Union]] on the way to a gold medal at the [[Ice hockey at the 1980 Winter Olympics|Winter Olympics]] in [[Lake Placid, New York|Lake Placid]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. The Soviet Union had won the gold medal in five of the six previous Winter Olympic Games, and were the favorites to win once more. Though ice hockey is not a major sport in most areas of the United States, the \"Miracle\" is often listed as one of the all-time greatest American sporting achievements. The U.S. also won the gold medal in the [[Ice hockey at the 1960 Winter Olympics|1960 Games]] at [[Squaw Valley, Placer County, California|Squaw Valley]], [[California]], defeating the Soviet Union, [[Canada men's national ice hockey team|Canada]], [[Czechoslovakia men's national ice hockey team|Czechoslovakia]], and [[Sweden men's national ice hockey team|Sweden]] along the way. However, since this victory is not as well known as the 1980 win, it has come to be known as the \"Forgotten Miracle\".<ref>{{cite web|last=Burnside|first=Scott|title=Hockey's miracle before the 'Miracle'|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/olympics/winter/2010/icehockey/columns/story?columnist=burnside_scott&id=4897805|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=February 8, 2010|accessdate=October 7, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The Morning Skate: The Forgotten Miracle of 1960|url=http://slapshot.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/12/11/the-morning-skate-the-forgotten-miracle-of-1960/|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=December 11, 2009|accessdate=October 7, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe U.S. and the Soviet Union next met at the Olympics in [[Ice hockey at the 1988 Winter Olympics|1988]]. As in 1980, the Soviets were represented by their star-studded veterans, while the Americans fielded a team of college players. The Soviets won the encounter 7\u20135 and went on to win the gold medal, while the U.S. placed seventh.\n\nThe two teams met again at the [[Ice hockey at the 1992 Winter Olympics|1992 Olympics]] in a semi-final match. There, the Unified Team (the successor to the Soviet Union) won 5\u20132. While some stars had left the Soviet Union to play in the NHL, the Unified Team still boasted many veterans from their domestic professional league, while the Americans were represented primarily by college players. The Unified Team eventually won the gold medal, while the U.S. placed fourth.\n\nThe U.S. and Russia (the successor to the Unified Team) met twice at the [[1996 World Cup of Hockey]]. The Americans won both games 5-2 en route to the tournament championship.\n\nThe U.S., coached by Herb Brooks, and Russia, coached by [[Viacheslav Fetisov|Slava Fetisov]], met twice in the [[Ice hockey at the 2002 Winter Olympics|2002 Winter Olympics]] in Salt Lake City, which included a 2\u20132 round-robin draw and a 3\u20132 semi-final win for the Americans. The semi-final match was played 22 years to the day after the \"Miracle on Ice\" game.<ref name=\"sportsillustrated.cnn.com\"/> The U.S. eventually won silver, while Russia won bronze.\n\nThe two teams met in the quarterfinals of the [[2004 World Cup of Hockey]], with the U.S. earning a decisive 5-3 victory.\n\nThe U.S. and Russia played each other in a round-robin game at the [[Ice hockey at the 2014 Winter Olympics|2014 Winter Olympics]] in Sochi. The game was tied 2\u20132 after overtime before the Americans prevailed in an eight-round shootout, with [[T.J. Oshie]] scoring on 4 of 6 attempts for the United States. The match has been dubbed by some as the \"Marathon on Ice\" due to its length.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.teamusa.org:443/Road-to-Sochi-2014/Features/2014/February/15/Team-USA-Beats-Russia-In-Marathon-On-Ice|title=Team USA Beats Russia In 'Marathon On Ice'|website=Team USA}}</ref> Both teams, however, failed to medal; the Americans finished fourth (losing in the semis to Canada and to Finland in the bronze medal game), while the Russians placed fifth (losing to Finland in the quarterfinals).\n\n==See also==\n*[[United States at the Summer Olympics]]\n*[[United States at the Winter Olympics]]\n*[[List of United States Olympic medalists]]\n*[[United States at the Paralympics]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{cite web |title=United States of America |publisher=International Olympic Committee |url=http://www.olympic.org/united-states-of-america }}\n* {{IOC medals|NOC=USA}}\n* {{cite web |title=Olympic Medal Winners |publisher=International Olympic Committee |url=http://www.olympic.org/athletes?search=1&countryname=united%20states%20of%20america }}\n* {{cite web |title=United States |publisher=Sports-Reference.com |url=https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/countries/USA }}\n\n{{country at games navbox|United States|Olympics}}\n{{Nations at the Olympics}}\n{{National sports teams of the United States}}\n{{Sport in the United States}}\n\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:United States At The Olympics}}\n[[Category:United States at the Olympics| ]]\n[[Category:National sports teams of the United States]]\n", "text_old": "{{infobox country at games\n| NOC = USA\n| NOCname = [[United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee]]\n| games = Olympics\n| year = \n| flagcaption = [[Flag of the United States]]\n| oldcode = \n| website = \n| location = \n| competitors = \n| sports = \n| flagbearer = \n| rank = 1\n| gold = 1127\n| silver = 907\n| bronze = 793\n| officials = \n| appearances = \n| app_begin_year = \n| app_end_year = \n| summerappearances = {{Team appearances list|team=United States|competition=Summer Olympics|begin_year=|end_year= }}\n| winterappearances = {{Team appearances list|team=United States|competition=Winter Olympics|begin_year=|end_year= }}\n| seealso = [[United States at the 1906 Intercalated Games|1906]] Intercalated Games\n}}\n{{See also|United States at the Summer Olympics|United States at the Winter Olympics}}\nThe '''[[United States|United States of America]]''' (USA) has sent athletes to every celebration of the modern [[Olympic Games]] with the exception of the [[1980 Summer Olympics]], during which it led a [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|boycott]] to protest the [[Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]]. The [[United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee]] (USOPC) is the [[National Olympic Committee]] for the United States.\n\nAmerican athletes have won a total of 2,522 medals (1,022 of them gold) at the [[Summer Olympic Games]] and another 305 at the [[Winter Olympic Games]], making the United States the most prolific medal-winning nation in the history of the Olympics. The US is ranked first in the all-time medal table even if [[All-time Olympic Games medal table#Combined total|all the incarnations of Russia and Germany are combined]], leading the second-placed Russians by 402 gold and 917 total medals. These achievements are even more impressive considering the fact that the American Olympic team remains the only in the world to receive no government funding.<ref>https://www.teamusa.org/about-the-usoc</ref>\n\nThe United States made its Olympic debut in 1896, when [[Athens]] hosted the very first [[1896 Summer Olympics|edition]] of the modern games. The nation performed inconsistently in the pre-[[World War I|WW1]] period primarily due to fielding considerably less athletes than hosting countries, with the exception being the [[1904 Summer Olympics|1904 Olympics]] in [[St. Louis]], [[Missouri]], where the US achieved its greatest medal haul in history, a record that still stands today. In the [[interwar period]], America enjoyed its most successful spell, topping both gold and total medal counts at four straight Summer Games, before falling short in [[1936 Summer Olympics|1936]], when [[Berlin]] hosted the games, and [[Nazi Germany|Germany]] used the event to push its political agenda. The next Olympics were held only in [[1948 Summer Olympics|1948]] when [[World War II|WW2]] hostilities ended. By this time, Germany was no longer a competitor to the US, with its places being taken by the [[Soviet Union at the Olympics|Soviet Union]], which went even further than the Germans and used the Olympics with a specific goal of pushing its ideological agenda. The Soviets clearly wanted to overtake the United States as a leading Olympic power and used any means they deemed necessary, including the use of professional athletes, something that was prohibited back then, and running a comprehensive state-sponsored doping program. The USSR ultimately achieved its goal, and after 20 years of fierce competition, it utterly thrashed America at the [[1972 Summer Olympics]] in [[Munich]]. After that, the US would not top a medal table in a non-boycotted games until [[1996 Summer Olympics]], five years after the USSR [[Fall of the Soviet Union|collapsed]]. The 1970s and 1980s, therefore, became a dark moment for American Olympic teams, as they significantly fell behind not only the Soviet Union, but also [[East Germany at the Olympics|East Germany]], USSR' [[satellite state]]. The only bright spot was the [[1984 Summer Olympics|1984 Games]] in [[Los Angeles]] where the United States set a record for most gold medals won in a single Olympics, 83, primarily due to the [[1984 Summer Olympics boycott|Soviet-led boycott]]. In the 1990s the situation started improving, and the US returned to the leading positions in the Summer Olympics, topping the medal table five times since 1992 and placing second on two occasions. \n\n== Hosted Games ==\nThe United States has hosted the Games on '''eight''' occasions, more than any other nation, and is planning to host the '''ninth''':\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The hosts, on the other hand, had 169 athletes competing and won 46 medals. The American team did its best, but managed to grab only 20 medals, being dwarfed by an enormous Greek team. However, the United States managed to get the most gold medals, 11, edging Greece that secured 10 golds. That allowed Team USA to finish first in the gold medal tally. [[James Brendan Connolly|James Connolly]] became the first modern Olympic champion by winning the [[Athletics at the 1896 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's triple jump|triple jump]], and [[Thomas Burke (athlete)|Thomas Burke]] grabbed three gold medals in various track events, assuming the title of the most successful athlete of the 1896 Games.<ref>https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/countries/USA/summer/1896/</ref>\n\n[[File:Margaret-abbott-gold-medal-1900-golf.jpg|thumb|left|[[Margaret Abbott]] competing in golf]]\nAt the [[1900 Summer Olympics|1900 Paris Olympics]], the US team featured 75 athletes, a significant increase compared to 1896, but still considerably less than the French hosts that fielded 720 competitors. The most notable of all American participants was [[Margaret Abbott]] who became the first female American Olympic champion by winning the [[Golf at the 1900 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's individual|women's golf]]. The vast majority of American medals were won in the sport of [[Athletics at the 1900 Summer Olympics|athletics]] where US athletes clinched 16 gold and 39 medals overall. Team USA won only 8 medals outside of track, four of them in golf. Overall, France dominated the medal standings, winning 29 gold and 112 total medals. The United States ranked second with 19 and 48, respectively, showing great efficiency, despite having significantly less athletes.<ref>https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/countries/USA/summer/1900/</ref>\n\n[[File:Francis Field 1904.jpg|thumb|[[Francis Olympic Field]] of [[Washington University in St. Louis]], site of the [[1904 Summer Olympics|1904 Olympics Games]]]]\nThe [[1904 Summer Olympics]] in [[St. Louis]], [[Missouri]] were the first ever Olympic Games held outside of Europe.\n\n===Interwar period (1920\u20131936)===\n\n===Cold War era (1948\u20131992)===\n[[File:Bob Mathias 1952.jpg|200px|left|thumb|[[Bob Mathias]] became the star of the [[1948 Summer Olympics|1948 London games]] by winning the [[Athletics at the 1948 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's decathlon|decathlon]] event at the age of 17. He would go on to repeat this feat at the [[Athletics at the 1952 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's decathlon|1952 Olympics]] in [[Helsinki]], setting a new world record.]]\nThe [[1948 Summer Olympics|1948 London Olympics]] marked the first time that the newly communist countries, that were occupied by the [[Soviet Union]] after [[World War Two|WW2]], competed in the games. The Soviets themselves declined to compete, sending only observers, after a long hesitation that saw Soviet leader [[Joseph Stalin]] demanding guarantees from his sports officials that the USSR would beat the US in the medal standings. The Soviet officials told him that chances were 50/50, and Stalin ultimately rejected the idea of competing in 1948. With its newest political rival absent, the United States comfortably dominated the games, winning 38 gold and 84 total medals, 22 gold and 40 total medals more than the runner-up [[Sweden at the 1948 Summer Olympics|Sweden]]. The most medals were won in track and field, 27, and swimming, 15. The [[1948 United States men's Olympic basketball team|US basketball team]] won its second consecutive gold medal, defeating [[France men's national basketball team|France]] in the final, 65\u201321.<ref>https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/countries/USA/summer/1948/</ref>\n\n[[File:USA-USSR.jpg|200px|right|thumb|Gold medal game in basketball at the [[Basketball at the 1952 Summer Olympics|1952 Olympics]] between the [[United States men's national basketball team|US]] and the [[Soviet Union men's national basketball team|USSR]]. The Americans won, 36-25.]]\nIn [[1952 Summer Olympics|1952]], [[Helsinki]] saw the Soviets sending a team for the first time. This was a beginning of a new era, as the Soviet Union would go on to dominate the Olympics for the next four decades. The Soviets viewed the Olympics as international battlefield, where they can achieve their political goals by winning medals, thus proving their system\u2019s superiority.<ref>http://blogs.bu.edu/guidedhistory/russia-and-its-empires/tyler-benson/</ref><ref>www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP80-00810A005600130009-0.pdf</ref> The Soviet authorities also significantly bent the amateur rules, that were in place at the time, by providing state-funding to their athletes who trained full-time and, unlike American self-financed amateurs, were ''[[de facto]]'' professionals. That would start a significant controversy, that will result in the amateur rules being abolished, though only in the 1990s, after the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]], meaning that the Soviets benefited from those rules throughout their Olympic history.<ref>http://www.processhistory.org/redihan-1952-olympics/</ref> The United States still topped the medal count at these games, winning 40 gold and 76 total medals, 22 gold and 5 total medals more than the [[Soviet Union at the 1952 Summer Olympics|Soviets]] who finished second. American athletes won 31 medals in track and field, their most successful sport. [[1952 United States men's Olympic basketball team|US basketball team]] won its third consecutive gold, twice defeating the Soviets in the process, American boxers won all five finals they entered, and American weightlifters edged their Soviet rivals 4 to 3 in terms of gold medals, with the two nations sweeping all seven events in the sport.<ref>https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/countries/USA/summer/1952/</ref>\n\n[[File:Bobby Morrow with wife 1956.jpg|200px|right|thumb|[[Bobby Morrow]] won gold in 100 meters, 200 meters, and 4x100 meters relay (track and field) at the [[Athletics at the 1956 Summer Olympics|1956 Summer Olympics]] in [[Melbourne]].]]\n[[Melbourne]] hosted the Olympics in [[1956 Summer Olympics|1956]]. There were calls for the expulsion of the Soviet Union following their [[Soviet invasion of Hungary|invasion of Hungary]], but the [[International Olympic Committee]] decided not to pursue any action. As a result, some nations boycotted the games in protest of the Soviets' presence, and the Hungarians themselves became engaged in a violent brawl with their Soviet counterparts in a water polo game, an event that was instantly called [[Blood in the Water match|Blood in the Water]]. The US performance at the games was relatively successful, though it was getting harder and harder to compete with the Soviet machine. As a result, the Americans earned 32 gold and 78 total medals (second place in the medal standings), 5 gold and 24 total medals less than the first-placed Soviets. The US contingent was particularly successful in track and field, where American athletes amassed 31 medals. On the other hand, the US won only 2 golds in swimming, being unable to stop the Australian domination of the swimming events at these games. In weightlifting, the Americans and Soviets once again won all seven events, once again with a 4 to 3 ratio in favor of the US team. In boxing, the Soviets won 3 golds, while the Americans only managed to win two events. However, it was gymnastics where the USSR achieved its greatest success, winning 11 out of 17 events and guaranteeing the first place in the medal rankings. The [[1956 United States men's Olympic basketball team|US basketball team]] won its fourth consecutive gold, beating the Soviets in the final game, 89\u201355.<ref>https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/countries/USA/summer/1956/</ref>\n\n[[File:Giuseppina leone.jpg|260px|left|thumb|[[Wilma Rudolph]] became the first woman in history to sweep 100 meters, 200 meters, and 4x100 meters relay at the [[Athletics at the 1960 Summer Olympics|1960 Rome Games]].]]\nThe [[1960 Summer Olympics|1960 Rome Olympics]] saw the Americans losing their grip on their traditionally successful sports, such as track and field and weightlifting. On the other hand, boxing, swimming (where the Americans won 9 gold medals, while being controversially denied gold in the [[Swimming at the 1960 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's 100 metre freestyle|100 meters freestyle]], despite showing the best time), and wrestling produced unexpectedly good results, which somewhat helped to compensate for what was lost in other sports. In track and field, the Soviets won 11 golds, only one less that the Americans. It is worth mentioning that the US team encountered many problems throughout the meet, such as a controversial disqualification of their gold medal winning [[Athletics at the 1960 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's 4 \u00d7 100 metres relay|men's 4x100 relay team]]. In weightlifting, the Soviets, with the help of their state-of-the-art doping program, won five out of seven events, leaving the US with only one gold. 10 Soviet golds in gymnastics didn't surprise anyone, as the nation had always been a gymnastics powerhouse, but it did mean that the Soviets beat the Americans in the medal standings for the second straight summer games. The [[1960 United States men's Olympic basketball team|US basketball team]], however, met the pre-tournament expectations and won its fifth consecutive gold medal, a noble feat, given that they had to compete against veteran pros from the USSR. The final result, 43 gold and 103 total medals for the Soviets to 34 gold and 71 total medals for the Americans, showed that America was no longer a leading force in Olympic competition.<ref>https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/countries/USA/summer/1960/</ref>\n\n[[File:Don Schollander 1964.jpg|200px|left|thumb|[[Don Schollander]] won 4 golds in swimming at the [[Swimming at the 1964 Summer Olympics|1964 games]] in [[Tokyo]], the largest individual medal haul in a single Olympics since [[Jesse Owens]] in 1936.]]\nThere was some redemption for the US at the [[1964 Summer Olympics]] in [[Tokyo]], as the nation returned to the top of the [[1964 Summer Olympics medal table|gold medal count]] for the first time since 1952. Particularly successful was the US swimming team that won 13 out of available 18 golds and shattered 9 world records. In track and field, the Americans also improved on their 1960 performance, winning 14 gold and 24 total medals, while the Soviets left Japan with 5 gold and 18 total medals, a significant downturn compared to their 1960 results. The Soviets, however, continued to dominate Olympic weightlifting, and, with the American program falling apart, the USSR produced four golds and three silvers. The Soviet Union hoped to replicate that success in gymnastics and wrestling, the sports that, together with weightlifting, were strongly associated with their athletic prowess. However, they encountered a zealous resistance from the Japanese, who used their [[home advantage|home-field advantage]] to stun the Soviets, beating them five to three in wrestling golds, and winning five gymnastics championships to their four. Thus, Japan had a major influence on the US\u2013USSR medals race, and most certainly helped the Americans edge their biggest rivals, while also managing to produce its best ever medal output and finishing in third place. For the Americans, despite their dismal performance in boxing where they achieved only one gold, the 1964 Olympics were a definite success, with the nation winning 36 gold and 90 total medals compared to the Soviet tally of 30 gold and 96 total medals. Therefore, the US topped the gold medal count, finishing second in the total medal count, while the USSR topped the total medal count, finishing second in the gold medal count. The [[1964 United States men's Olympic basketball team|US basketball team]] won its sixth consecutive gold, beating the Soviets in the final, 73\u201359.<ref>https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/countries/USA/summer/1964/</ref>\n\n[[File:Bob Beamon 1968.jpg|200px|right|thumb|There were many historic achievements at the [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968 Mexico City Olympics]] but, perhaps, the most significant among them was [[Bob Beamon]]'s performance in the [[Athletics at the 1968 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's long jump|long jump]], where he improved the world record by 55 cm.]]\nThe [[1968 Summer Olympics|1968 Mexico Olympics]] became the most successful summer games for the US in the post-war era. American athletes amassed 45 gold and 107 total medals, 16 gold and 16 total medals more than the second-placed Soviets. The US swimming team dominated the competition, winning a staggering 51 medals and sweeping the podium on five occasions. The Americans also managed to medal in every single of 29 swimming events, thus achieving a unique feat. The US track and field team pulled off a stellar performance as well with 15 gold and 28 total medals. Overall, swimming and athletics accounted for more than 70% of all US medals, and ensured the first place in the medal table for the Americans, their second consecutive first-place finish in terms of gold medals, and their first finish at the top of the overall medal table since 1952. In other sports, however, the performance of American athletes was less convincing. The US weightlifting team continued to fade away, winning just one medal (compared to 7 in 1956), American boxers won 7 medals, though only two of them gold, US divers won 6 medals, and the men's volleyball team managed to stun the defending champions from the Soviet Union, beating them in five sets, but still finished out of medals; Soviets ultimately won gold, with their lone loss being to the US. In gymnastics, Japan continued to frustrate the Soviets, once again surpassing them in the medal standings. Last but not least, the [[1968 United States men's Olympic basketball team|US basketball team]] won its seventh consecutive gold medal, a feat not matched by any other Olympic team in ball sports. Very few would have assumed that this was the last time that the US finished first in the medal table in a fully attended Summer Olympics until 1996 (the Americans would top the medal standings in 1984 with the Soviet Union and its satellites boycotting).<ref>https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/countries/USA/summer/1968/</ref>\n\nThe [[1972 Summer Olympics|Munich Olympics]] saw the Soviet Union begin its streak of topping the medal count at five consecutive summer games in which they participated (1972\u20131992, though in 1992 they would compete as the ''[[Unified Team at the 1992 Summer Olympics|Unified Team]]'' as the USSR [[Fall of the Soviet Union|dissolved]] half a year prior to the games, and the newly independent countries decided to compete together). The sporting nature of the event was largely overshadowed by the [[Munich massacre]] in the second week, in which eleven [[Israel]]i [[Israel at the 1972 Summer Olympics|athletes and coaches]] and a West German police officer at Olympic village were killed by [[Black September Organization|Black September]] terrorists. There were multiple calls to cancel the games after the terrorist attack, but the IOC declined. From a sporting standpoint, these games were one of the most controversial in history, with many accusing the organizing committee of anti-Americanism and trying to appease the Soviet Union and East Germany. Indeed, these were one the strangest Olympics ever for American athletes. US world record holders in the [[Athletics at the 1972 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's 100 metres|100 meters]] were given the wrong starting time and were unable to compete in the event, thus paving the way for a Soviet to win. In swimming, the US gold medal winner in the [[Swimming at the 1972 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's 400 metre freestyle|400 meters freestyle]] was stripped of his medal for using his prescription asthma medication, also depriving him of a chance at multiple medals. US boxers complained that they were judged unfairly in the bouts against their communist counterparts. In shooting, a US athlete initially won the [[Shooting at the 1972 Summer Olympics \u2013 Mixed 50 metre rifle, prone|50 meters rifle]] only to be relegated to silver after a \"review\". Finally, in the most controversial event of the games, and one of the most controversial events of all time, the [[1972 United States men's Olympic basketball team|US basketball team]] was denied gold after apparently winning the final match against the Soviet Union. The final three seconds of the game were replayed three times until the Soviets came out on top. The Americans did not accept the silver medals, believing that they were robbed. This was the first US loss in Olympic basketball history and it ended the Americans' 63-game winning streak in Olympic basketball. In general, the US team greatly underperformed at these games, winning only 6 gold medals in track and field to the East Germans' 8 and Soviets' 9, though the Americans still won the most total medals, 22. In boxing, the Cubans and Soviets dominated, winning three and two championships, respectively, while the US won only one gold and four medals overall (compared to the Soviets' two and Cubans' five). In diving, the Americans won three medals; in soccer, the USSR and GDR fixed a bronze medal game, playing a tie, so both teams received bronze; in gymnastics, the Soviets edged their old rivals Japan to top the medal count; in weightlifting, the Soviets and Bulgarians won three golds each; in wrestling, the US team surprised with three golds in freestyle, yet the Soviets still dwarfed their medal tally with nine golds in freestyle and greco-roman (14\u20136 in total medals). In water polo, the Americans struck bronze, tying the eventual gold medalists the Soviet Union in the final round. Swimming was the only sport where the American team did not disappoint, winning 17 gold and 43 total medals, a good result, but still less than four years earlier. American women dominated swimming for the last time until 1992, as by 1976 they would be overtaken by East German [[Doping in East Germany|dopers]].<ref>https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/countries/USA/summer/1972/</ref>\n\nThe Eastern Bloc utterly dominated the [[1976 Summer Olympics|1976 Montreal Olympics]], with seven communist countries placing in the top ten of the medal table. The United States team was relegated to a third place in the medal standings for the first time in its history, courtesy of Soviet and East German doping systems and their use of professional athletes. This was the Olympics of contrasts: the US men's swimming team, despite a generally dismal showing of the delegation, completely obliterated their sport, sweeping 12 gold and 27 total medals in the 13 events that were on the program and shattering 11 world records in the process (this was arguably the most dominant performance of any swimming team in history),<ref>https://www.indystar.com/story/sports/2016/07/31/docs-boys-story-dominant-us-swim-team-1976/87614856/</ref> while the US women's swimming team, on the other hand, fell victim to the unbeatable East German dopers. They still managed to win a gold medal, in a shocking upset against East Germans in the [[Swimming at the 1976 Summer Olympics \u2013 Women's 4 \u00d7 100 metre freestyle relay|4x100 freestyle relay]]. The event was held on the last day of the swimming program, and the American women were risking to get shut out of gold for the first time in the US Olympic history. The victory was somewhat overlooked at the time, but since the early 1990s, when the crimes of the Soviet Bloc started to unravel, their gold medal is often considered to be one of the most improbable and heroic upsets of all time.<ref>https://www.dailynews.com/2016/06/04/40-years-later-story-of-us-east-german-olympic-swimmers-can-be-told-best-in-the-last-gold/</ref> In track and field, both the US men's and women's team were overwhelmed by East Germans who, as their Soviet masters expected, stole away a bulk of medals from the US in its signature sports, thus allowing the Soviets to win the medal table virtually unchallenged. The US boxing team surprised everyone, advancing to six gold medal bouts and winning five of them, drawing parallels to a stellar 1952 team that also took 5 golds. The achievement was even more momentous due to the fact that the American boxers were significantly younger and less experienced than their Cuban and Soviet counterparts.<ref>https://www.espn.com/boxing/story/_/id/15293108/1976-us-olympic-boxing-team-celebrate-40-year-reunion-boxing-hall-fame-banquet-champions</ref> In other sports, US divers won 5 medals, including two golds; the US equestrian team took home 4 medals; American shooters won three medals, including a historic silver by a woman in the [[Shooting at the 1976 Summer Olympics \u2013 Mixed 50 metre rifle three positions|mixed 50 meters rifle three positions]]; US freestyle wrestlers advanced to four gold medal bouts, yet won only one of them (all four were against the Soviets), concluding the meet with 6 medals overall. The [[1976 United States men's Olympic basketball team|US men's basketball team]] reclaimed the gold medal, while the [[United States women's national basketball team|women's team]] won a surprising silver, being ranked no higher than sixth prior to the start of the tournament. The Soviets and East Germans were unstoppable in canoeing, gymnastics, rowing, weightlifting and wrestling, going 1\u20132 in the medal standings (49 gold and 125 total medals for the Soviets, and 40 gold and 90 total medals for East Germans). The US won medals in 14 sports, finishing third with 34 gold and 94 total medals. The most successful day for the Americans was July 31st when they won 8 gold and 18 total medals.<ref>https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/countries/USA/summer/1976/</ref>\n\nThe [[1980 Summer Olympics]] marked another first for the United States, as the nation led by far the largest and most significant [[1980 Summer Olympics boycott|boycott]] in the Olympic history. The boycott was motivated by the [[1979 Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]], as well as by flagrant human rights violations in the USSR, and the regime's [[Antisemitism|anti-Semitic]] policies.<ref>U. Tulli, \"Bringing Human Rights In: The Campaign Against the 1980 Moscow Olympic Games and the Origins of the Nexus Between Human Rights and the Olympic Games\", in The International Journal of the History of Sport, Vol.33, Issue 16 (2016-2017) https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/09523367.2017.1315104</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://2001-2009.state.gov/r/pa/ho/time/qfp/104481.htm|title=The Olympic Boycott, 1980|work=U.S. Department of State Archive}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/packages/html/sports/year_in_sports/01.20.html|title=The President Said Nyet|work=The New York Times|author=Smith, Terence|date=January 20, 1980}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.csmonitor.com/1980/0415/041531.html|title=How the Russians break the Olympic rules|publisher=[[The Christian Science Monitor]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/14/sports/olympics/soviet-doping-plan-russia-rio-games.html?_r=0|title=The Soviet Doping Plan: Document Reveals Illicit Approach to '84 Olympics|work=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref> The Soviet state-run media ridiculed the Americans as sore losers who couldn't get over the fact that they were no longer a perennial Olympic power, and simply didn't want to be embarrassed by the Soviets who would thrash them in the medal count. Indeed, all medal predictions pointed to an inevitable Soviet victory with 55\u201360 gold medals. East Germans were forecast to win 40\u201345 gold medals, while the Americans would wind up in third place with 30\u201335 golds. However, the world will never know what would have happened, as the United States and 65 other countries chose not to attend the Moscow Games, leaving them with the smallest attendance since 1956. Predictably, the great majority of the medals were taken by the [[Soviet Union at the 1980 Summer Olympics|host country]] and [[East Germany at the 1980 Summer Olympics|East Germany]] in what was the most skewed medal tally since [[1904 Summer Olympics|1904]].<ref>Moscow 1980 Olympic Games. Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica Online Library Edition: http://www.library.ebonline.com/eb/article-9098213</ref> The Soviets amassed 80 gold (all-time record) and 195 total (second-best result after the US in 1904) medals in their anticlimactic performance.<ref>https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/summer/1980/</ref>\n\nIn [[1984 Summer Olympics|1984]], [[Los Angeles]] witnessed what was considered a retaliatory boycott by the Soviets and their satellites, although the Soviets cited security concerns and \"chauvinistic sentiments and an anti-Soviet hysteria being whipped up in the United States.\" However, no threat to Eastern Bloc athletes was ever discovered, and the athletes from the Eastern Bloc country that did attend the 1984 games in Los Angeles&mdash;Romania&mdash;encountered no problems, and in fact were widely cheered above all other visiting nations at the Opening Ceremonies when they marched into the Coliseum (Romania ended up finishing third in overall medal count at the Games). The move by the Soviets left many \"dumbfounded\", as it was expected that they would try to thrash the US on their soil, thus achieving a significant propaganda victory. The forecasts again heavily favored the Soviet Union, with the Soviet athletes being expected to rack up 60\u201365 gold medals compared to 35\u201345 by the second-placed Americans. That didn't happen. Furthermore, despite the Soviet boycott, a record 140 nations (including China that participated for the first time since 1952) attended the games.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://jimrome.com/2017/11/15/bryan-fogel-talks-1984-summer-olympics-boycott-on-the-jim-rome-podcast/|website=jimrome.com|title=Bryan Fogel talks 1984 Summer Olympics boycott on The Jim Rome Podcast|access-date=November 23, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171122112500/http://jimrome.com/2017/11/15/bryan-fogel-talks-1984-summer-olympics-boycott-on-the-jim-rome-podcast/|archive-date=November 22, 2017|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nThere were fears that the Soviet Union would boycott the [[1988 Summer Olympics]] in [[Seoul]] as well because [[South Korea]] had no diplomatic relations with the USSR, which recognised and supported only [[North Korea]]. However, the policies of [[Perestroika]] that were initiated by [[Mikhail Gorbachev|Gorbachev]] in 1985 led to the Soviet participation in the games. [[Cuba at the Summer Olympics|Cuba]], clearly not understanding such a betrayal, decided to boycott the Olympics on its own, impacting the boxing field as a result. The Soviet Union was steadily moving towards its ultimate [[Collapse of the Soviet Union|collapse]] but its sporting empire was still in its prime. The Soviets and their close allies from East Germany utterly dominated the games, winning 55 and 37 gold medals respectively (132 and 102 total medals). \n\nDuring the [[Cold War]] period The Americans did their best to challenge the Soviets, but the playing field wasn't level. The Soviet athletes were funded by the state and trained full-time, while the US strictly obeyed the amateur rules and its athletes were primarily self-financed students who were significantly younger and less experienced than the Soviet veterans. In addition to that, the Soviets developed a state-sponsored doping system, and supplied performance-enhancing drugs to the vast majority of their athletes.<ref>https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/14/sports/olympics/soviet-doping-plan-russia-rio-games.html</ref> Furthermore, they heavily invested in the development of a similar system in their satellite nation, [[East Germany at the Olympics|East Germany]], with a specific goal of making East Germans highly competitive in swimming and track and field, so that they can reduce the number of medals the Americans win in their signature sports. Unfortunately for the US, the Soviet strategy worked, and the gap between the USSR and US widened every four years until the collapse of the Soviet Union. In 1972, the Soviets won 50 gold and 99 total medals to the Americans' 33 and 94; in 1976, the USSR amassed 49 gold and 125 total medals to the Americans' 34 and 94; 1980 Olympics were boycotted by the US and its allies, the Soviets retaliated in 1984 by boycotting the LA Olympics together with their satellites; finally, in 1988, the USSR won 55 gold and 132 total medals to the Americans' 36 and 94 (the US finished third at those games, losing even to the East Germans). In 1992, the Soviets still fielded a team despite the dissolution of their state, yet the margin of their victory over the Americans became narrower: 45 gold and 112 total medals to the Americans' 37 and 108. By 1996, every former Soviet republic formed its own [[National Olympic Committee]], and the countries participated as independent nations, with Russia assuming the Soviet place in the IOC and inheriting Soviet achievements as by far the largest of the former Soviet republics. So, in 1996, the Americans finally managed to return to the top spot in the medal rankings, winning 44 gold and 101 total medals compared to 26 gold and 63 total medals won by the second-placed Russians, thanks to the partial abolition of the amateur rules in the early 1990s (the American athletes still weren't state-sponsored, unlike their foreign counterparts, but they were now eligible for prize money and sponsorships). They were still disadvantaged by these rules in those sports where they weren't abolished (i.e. boxing, baseball, where Cubans continued to field state-sponsored pros against American amateurs), but the situation started improving.\n\n===Modern period (1994\u2013present)===\n{{Expand section|date=February 2020}}\n\n==Amateurism and professionalism==\nThe exclusion of professionals caused several controversies throughout the history of the modern Olympics. The [[1912 Summer Olympics|1912 Olympic]] [[pentathlon]] and [[decathlon]] champion [[Jim Thorpe]] was stripped of his medals when it was discovered that he had played semi-professional baseball before the Olympics. His medals were posthumously restored by the [[International Olympic Committee|IOC]] in 1983 on compassionate grounds.<ref>{{cite web |title=Jim Thorpe Biography |publisher=Biography.com |url=http://www.biography.com/search/article.do?id=9507017 |accessdate=9 February 2009}}</ref>\n\nThe advent of the state-sponsored \"full-time amateur athlete\" of the [[Eastern Bloc]] countries eroded the ideology of the pure [[amateur sports#Olympics|amateur]], as it put the self-financed amateurs of the Western countries at a disadvantage. The [[Soviet Union at the Olympics|Soviet Union]] entered teams of athletes who were all nominally students, soldiers, or working in a profession, but all of whom were in reality paid by the state to train on a full-time basis.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.bu.edu/guidedhistory/russia-and-its-empires/tyler-benson/|title=The Role of Sports in The Soviet Union - Guided History|website=blogs.bu.edu}}</ref><ref name=\"cia.gov\">{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/readingroom/docs/CIA-RDP80-00810A005600130009-0.pdf |title=Info |website=www.cia.gov }}</ref><ref name=\"cia.gov\"/> The situation greatly disadvantaged American athletes, and was a major factor in the decline of American medal hauls in the 1970s and 1980s. As a result, the Olympics shifted away from [[Amateur sports|amateurism]], as envisioned by [[Pierre de Coubertin]], to allowing participation of [[professional athlete]]s, but only in the 1990s, after the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]] and its influence within the [[International Olympic Committee]].\n\n==Russia\u2013United States rivalry==\n[[Russia]] (in all its incarnations) and the [[United States]] have won more Olympic medals than any other nation.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.statista.com/statistics/262864/all-time-summer-olympics-medals-table/|title=All-time Summer Olympics medals table 1896-2016 &#124; Statistic|website=Statista}}</ref> Russia topped the [[All-time Olympic Games medal table|overall medal count]] at 7 Summer Olympics and 9 Winter Olympics, while the United States placed first at 17 Summer Olympics and 1 Winter Olympics.

The U.S. men's team was considered a favorite in the run-up to the 1972 Games. Since the first Olympic basketball tournament at the [[Basketball at the 1936 Summer Olympics|1936 Olympics]] in [[Berlin]], the Americans haven't lost a single game, winning seven consecutive gold medals in a dominating fashion. Their record reached an unprecedented 63-0 before the final game. Since the [[Basketball at the 1952 Summer Olympics|1952 tournament]] the Soviet team challenged the Americans, winning silver in 1952, [[Basketball at the 1956 Summer Olympics|1956]], [[Basketball at the 1960 Summer Olympics|1960]], [[Basketball at the 1964 Summer Olympics|1964]] and bronze in [[Basketball at the 1968 Summer Olympics|1968]]. Outside of the Olympics, the Soviets had already defeated the U.S. team in the [[FIBA World Cup|World Championship]] play. However, the Americans never sent their best collegiate players to that tournament. \n\nIt is important to note that the Olympics strictly prohibited any involvement of professional athletes at the time. The Soviet Union and other [[Eastern Bloc]] countries used that rule to their advantage, listing all its top players as soldiers or workers what allowed them to breach the amateur rules. Western experts classified these athletes as professionals.<ref name=\"a1972\">{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/classic/s/Classic_1972_usa_ussr_gold_medal_hoop.html|title=Classic 1972 USA vs. USSR Basketball game|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=August 6, 2004|accessdate=April 13, 2009}}</ref> On the other hand, leading American players were unable to play in the Olympics as they were officially professional and played in the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]]. That disadvantage hadn't prevented the Americans from winning the first seven Olympic basketball tournaments without a single defeat.\n\nThe confrontation of the Soviet Union and United States on the [[basketball court]] was deeply connected to the confrontation on the political front. Many American viewers assumed that 1972 Games were openly [[Anti-Americanism|anti-American]].<ref name=espn1>''By Frank Saraceno''.

[http://www.la84foundation.org/SportsLibrary/JSH/JSH2002/JSH2903/jsh2903ag.pdf \u00ab03 Seconds From Gold\u00bb (2002).] \u00abJournal of Sports History\u00bb (vol 29, issue 3, page 518\u2014522) // la84foundation.org</ref>\n\nThe [[1972 United States men's Olympic basketball team|United States team]] was the youngest in history. American players usually participated in the Olympics once before turning pro, and the U.S. team always had new players every four years. The 1972 team didn't have a clear leader. A rising star [[Bill Walton]] declined an invitation to participate. Nevertheless, the team was heavily favored featuring such players as [[Doug Collins (basketball)|Doug Collins]] or [[Tommy Burleson]] (the tallest player among all teams).\n\nThe young American team was confronted by a veteran Soviet team, featuring stars [[Sergei Belov]], [[Modestas Paulauskas]], and [[Alexander Belov]]. The players had played together for more than seven years. For [[Gennadi Volnov]] it was the fourth Olympic appearance.\n\nThe Soviets performed strongly at the beginning, winning the first half 26:21. The Soviets kept the Americans 4\u20138 points behind during the first half.\n\nIn the second half Soviets targeted [[Dwight Jones (basketball)|Dwight Jones]], as they considered him the leader of the U.S. team. On the 28th minute he was provoked by [[Mikheil Korkia]] and responded. Both players were sent off. The Soviets were satisfied, as they deemed Korkia less significant for them than Jones for the Americans. The next minute Alexander Belov hit [[Jim Brewer (basketball)|Jim Brewer]] during the free-throw, and Brewer was unable to continue playing. According to the Americans, the referees did not notice the foul.\n\nWith 10 minutes left, the Soviets increased their lead to 10 points. After that Americans finally started to press the Soviets. It helped them to cut the deficit to 1 point. Soviet players started to feel nervous. With less than a minute left, [[Doug Collins (basketball)|Doug Collins]] stole a Soviet pass at halfcourt and was fouled hard by [[Zurab Sakandelidze]] as he drove toward the basket, being knocked down into the basket stanchion. With three seconds remaining on the game clock, Collins was awarded two free throws and sank the first to tie the score at 49. Just as Collins lifted the ball to begin his shooting motion in attempting the second free throw, the horn from the scorer's table sounded, marking the beginning of a chain of events that left the game's final three seconds mired in controversy. Although the unexpected sound of the horn caused lead referee [[Renato Righetto]] to turn away from the free throw attempt and look over to the scorer's table, play was not stopped. Collins never broke his shooting motion and continued with his second free throw, scoring to put the U.S. ahead by a score of 50:49. Immediately following Collins' free throws, the Soviets inbounded the ball and failed to score. Soviet coaches claimed that they had requested a timeout before Collins' foul shots. The referees ordered the clock reset to three seconds and the game's final seconds replayed. The horn sounded as a length-of-the-court Soviet pass was being released from the inbounding player, the pass missed its mark, and the American players began celebrating. Nevertheless, final three seconds were replayed for a third time. This time, the Soviets' [[Alexander Belov]] and the USA's [[Kevin Joyce (basketball)|Kevin Joyce]] and [[James Forbes (basketball)|Jim Forbes]] went up for the pass, and Belov caught the long pass from Ivan Edeshko near the American basket. Belov then laid the ball in for the winning points as the buzzer sounded.\n\nThe Americans regained the basketball crown in [[Basketball at the 1976 Summer Olympics|1976]], but their ability to stay competitive with college players against seasoned professionals from the Soviet Union was decreasing. In [[Basketball at the 1988 Summer Olympics|1988]], the Soviets beat the United States once again, eliminating them in the semifinals. That game was a turning point in international basketball, as [[FIBA]] officials started to realize that amateur rules were extremely unfair. In 1989, NBA players were finally allowed in the Olympics.\n\n===Ice hockey===\n{{see also|Miracle on Ice}}\n[[File:TeamUSA1980 stamp.png|thumb|upright|alt=Beige postage stamp featuring a brightly colored hockey player|Paraguayan stamp featuring U.S. vs USSR matchup.]]\nThe 1980 hockey game between the U.S. and USSR was dubbed the \"[[Miracle on Ice]]\", when American college players defeated the heavily favored seasoned professionals from the [[Soviet Union national ice hockey team|Soviet Union]] on the way to a gold medal at the [[Ice hockey at the 1980 Winter Olympics|Winter Olympics]] in [[Lake Placid, New York|Lake Placid]], [[New York (state)|New York]]. The Soviet Union had won the gold medal in five of the six previous Winter Olympic Games, and were the favorites to win once more. Though ice hockey is not a major sport in most areas of the United States, the \"Miracle\" is often listed as one of the all-time greatest American sporting achievements. The U.S. also won the gold medal in the [[Ice hockey at the 1960 Winter Olympics|1960 Games]] at [[Squaw Valley, Placer County, California|Squaw Valley]], [[California]], defeating the Soviet Union, [[Canada men's national ice hockey team|Canada]], [[Czechoslovakia men's national ice hockey team|Czechoslovakia]], and [[Sweden men's national ice hockey team|Sweden]] along the way. However, since this victory is not as well known as the 1980 win, it has come to be known as the \"Forgotten Miracle\".<ref>{{cite web|last=Burnside|first=Scott|title=Hockey's miracle before the 'Miracle'|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/olympics/winter/2010/icehockey/columns/story?columnist=burnside_scott&id=4897805|publisher=[[ESPN]]|date=February 8, 2010|accessdate=October 7, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=The Morning Skate: The Forgotten Miracle of 1960|url=http://slapshot.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/12/11/the-morning-skate-the-forgotten-miracle-of-1960/|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=December 11, 2009|accessdate=October 7, 2011}}</ref>\n\nThe U.S. and the Soviet Union next met at the Olympics in [[Ice hockey at the 1988 Winter Olympics|1988]]. As in 1980, the Soviets were represented by their star-studded veterans, while the Americans fielded a team of college players. The Soviets won the encounter 7\u20135 and went on to win the gold medal, while the U.S. placed seventh.\n\nThe two teams met again at the [[Ice hockey at the 1992 Winter Olympics|1992 Olympics]] in a semi-final match. There, the Unified Team (the successor to the Soviet Union) won 5\u20132. While some stars had left the Soviet Union to play in the NHL, the Unified Team still boasted many veterans from their domestic professional league, while the Americans were represented primarily by college players. The Unified Team eventually won the gold medal, while the U.S. placed fourth.\n\nThe U.S. and Russia (the successor to the Unified Team) met twice at the [[1996 World Cup of Hockey]]. The Americans won both games 5-2 en route to the tournament championship.\n\nThe U.S., coached by Herb Brooks, and Russia, coached by [[Viacheslav Fetisov|Slava Fetisov]], met twice in the [[Ice hockey at the 2002 Winter Olympics|2002 Winter Olympics]] in Salt Lake City, which included a 2\u20132 round-robin draw and a 3\u20132 semi-final win for the Americans. The semi-final match was played 22 years to the day after the \"Miracle on Ice\" game.<ref name=\"sportsillustrated.cnn.com\"/> The U.S. eventually won silver, while Russia won bronze.\n\nThe two teams met in the quarterfinals of the [[2004 World Cup of Hockey]], with the U.S. earning a decisive 5-3 victory.\n\nThe U.S. and Russia played each other in a round-robin game at the [[Ice hockey at the 2014 Winter Olympics|2014 Winter Olympics]] in Sochi. The game was tied 2\u20132 after overtime before the Americans prevailed in an eight-round shootout, with [[T.J. Oshie]] scoring on 4 of 6 attempts for the United States.

The insulation properties depend on bubbles of gas enclosed within the material, which reduce its ability to [[Conduction (heat)|conduct heat]]. The bubbles also give the wetsuit a low [[density]], providing buoyancy in water.\n\n[[Hugh Bradner]], a [[University of California, Berkeley]], physicist invented the modern wetsuit in 1952. Wetsuits became available in the mid-1950s and evolved as the relatively fragile foamed neoprene was first backed, and later sandwiched, with thin sheets of tougher material such as nylon or later [[spandex|spandex (also known as lycra)]]. Improvements in the way joints in the wetsuit were made by gluing, taping and blindstitching, helped the suit to remain waterproof and reduce ''flushing'', the replacement of water trapped between suit and body by cold water from the outside.<ref name=wetsuitswork /> Further improvements in the seals at the neck, wrists, ankles and zippers produced a suit known as a \"semi-dry\".\n\nDifferent types of wetsuit are made for different uses and for different temperatures.<ref name=Williams2003 /> Suits range from a thin (2&nbsp;mm or less) \"shortie\", covering just the torso, to a full 8&nbsp;mm semi-dry, usually complemented by neoprene boots, gloves and hood.\n\nThe difference between a wetsuit and a [[dry suit]] is that a wetsuit allows water to enter the suit, while dry suits are designed to prevent water from entering, thus keeping the undergarments dry and preserving their insulating effectiveness.  Wetsuits can give adequate protection in warm to moderately cold waters. Dry suits are typically more expensive and more complex to don but can be used where protection from low temperatures or contaminated water is needed.<ref name=Barsky />\n\n==Uses==\nWetsuits are used for thermal insulation for activities where the user is likely to be immersed in water, or frequently doused with heavy spray, often approaching from near-horizontal directions, where normal wet-weather clothing is unlikely to keep the water out.\nActivities include [[underwater diving]], [[sailing]], [[Lifeboat (rescue)|sea rescue]] operations, [[surfing]], [[river rafting]], [[whitewater kayaking]] and in some circumstances, endurance swimming.\n<gallery mode=packed>\nFile:Decompression Dive-Preparation.JPG|alt=Two scuba divers in one-piece wetsuits and full scuba gear sitting in a boat, preparing to dive.

Nitrogen, like most gases, has very low [[thermal conductivity]] compared to water or to solids,<ref group=\"note\">Nitrogen has a thermal conductivity of 0.024&nbsp;Wm<sup>\u22121</sup>K<sup>\u22121</sup>, the same as air \u2013 {{cite web |url=http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/thermal-conductivity-d_429.html |title=Thermal conductivity of some common materials |year=2005 |publisher=The Engineering ToolBox |accessdate=August 12, 2009}}</ref> and the small and enclosed nature of the gas bubbles minimizes heat transport through the gas by convection in the same way that cloth fabrics or feathers insulate by reducing convection of enclosed air spaces. The result is that the gas filled cavities restrict heat transfer to mostly conduction, which is partly through bubbles of entrapped gas, thereby greatly reducing heat transfer from the body (or from the layer of warmed water trapped between the body and the wetsuit) to the colder water surrounding the wetsuit.\n\nUncompressed foam neoprene has a typical thermal conductivity in the region of 0.054&nbsp;Wm<sup>\u22121</sup>K<sup>\u22121</sup>, which produces about twice the heat loss of still air, or one-tenth the loss of water. However at a depth of about {{convert|15|m|ft|-1}} of water, the thickness of the neoprene will be halved and its conductivity will be increased by about 50%, allowing heat to be lost at three times the rate at the surface.<ref name=\"Bardy2005\" />\n\nA wetsuit must have a snug fit to work efficiently when immersed; too loose a fit, particularly at the openings (wrists, ankles, neck and overlaps) will allow cold water from the outside to enter when the wearer moves.<ref name=wetsuitswork/> Flexible seals at the suit cuffs aid in preventing heat loss in this fashion. The elasticity of the foamed neoprene and surface textiles allow enough stretch for many people to effectively wear off-the-shelf sizes, but others have to have their suits custom fitted to get a good fit that is not too tight for comfort and safety.\n\nFoamed neoprene is very buoyant, helping swimmers to stay afloat, and for this reason divers need to carry [[Diving weighting system|extra weight]] based on the volume of their suit to achieve neutral [[buoyancy]] near the surface.<ref name=Williams2003/> However, the suit loses thermal protection as the bubbles in the neoprene are compressed at depth<ref name=Monji1989 /><ref group=\"note\">Non-foamed solid neoprene has a thermal conductivity between 0.15&nbsp;Wm<sup>\u22121</sup>K<sup>\u22121</sup> and 0.45&nbsp;Wm<sup>\u22121</sup>K<sup>\u22121</sup> depending on type, not very different from water \u2013 {{cite web |url=http://physics.info/conduction/ |title=Conduction |first=Glenn |last=Elert |year=2008 |work=The Physics Hypertextbook |accessdate=April 27, 2014}}</ref> Buoyancy is also reduced by compression, and scuba divers can correct this  by inflating the [[Buoyancy compensator (diving)|buoyancy compensator]].\n\n=== Semi-dry suits ===\n[[File:MutaSemistagnaCernieraFodera.jpg|thumb|alt=Detail of the zipper of a semi-dry wetsuit, showing one end of an open zipper and the neoprene flaps that cover it on the inside and outside of the suit to protect the zipper, improve comfort, and reduce leakage through the closed zip.|Detail showing zipper attachment, internal flap and cover flap of semi-dry suit]]<!--illustrates a detail described in the text quite well-->\nSemi-dry suits are effectively a wetsuit with reasonably effective seals at wrist, neck, ankles and zipper. The seals limit the amount of water entering and leaving the suit when the wearer moves in the water. The wearer gets wet in a semi-dry suit but the water that enters is soon warmed up and does not leave the suit readily, so the wearer remains warm. The trapped layer of water does not add significantly to the suit's insulating ability. Any residual water circulation past the seals still causes heat loss. Semi-dry suits are cheap and simple compared to dry suits. They are usually made from thick Neoprene, which provides good thermal protection at shallow depth, but lose buoyancy and thermal protection as the gas bubbles in the Neoprene compress at depth. Semi-dry suits can come in various configurations including a one-piece full-body suit or two pieces, made of 'long johns' and a separate 'jacket'.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}<!--for two-piece semi-dry suits--> The zipper is commonly across the shoulders on the back, but other arrangements have been used.

In this case, the water would quickly reach skin temperature and the air in the fabric would continue to act as the thermal insulation to keep it that way. In the popular mind, the layer of water between skin and suit has been credited with providing the insulation. However, Bradner clearly understood that the suit did not need to be wet because it was not the water that provided the insulation but rather the gas in the suit fabric.<ref name=sfc /><ref name=times /> He initially sent his ideas to Lauriston C. \"Larry\" Marshall who was involved in a U.S. Navy/National Research Council Panel on Underwater Swimmers.<ref name=Rainey /> However, it was [[Willard Bascom]], an engineer at the [[Scripps Institution of Oceanography]] in [[La Jolla, California]], who suggested neoprene as a feasible material to Bradner.<ref name=times/>\n\nHowever, Bradner and Bascom were not overly interested in profiting from their design and were unable to successfully market a version to the public.<ref name=times/> They attempted to patent their neoprene wetsuit design, but their application was rejected because the design was viewed as too similar to a [[flight suit]].<ref name=times/> The [[United States Navy]] also turned down Bradner's and Bascom's offer to supply its swimmers and frogmen with the new wetsuits due to concerns that the gas in the neoprene component of the suits might make it easier for naval divers to be detected by underwater [[sonar]].<ref name=times/> The first written documentation of Bradner's invention was in a letter to Marshall, dated June 21, 1951.<ref name=Rainey/>\n\n[[Jack O'Neill (businessman)|Jack O'Neill]] started using closed-cell neoprene foam which was shown to him by his bodysurfing friend, Harry Hind, who knew of it as an insulating material in his laboratory work.{{citation needed|date=May 2010|reason=this text replaced differing content, albeit weakly sourced}} After experimenting with the material and finding it superior to other insulating foams, O'Neill founded the successful wetsuit manufacturing company called [[O'Neill (brand)|''O'Neill'']] in a San Francisco garage in 1952, later relocating to Santa Cruz, California<ref name=santacruzwetsuits /> in 1959 with the motto \"It's Always Summer on the Inside\".<ref name=\"surfline\" /><ref name=\"O'Neill\" /> Bob and [[Bill Meistrell]], from [[Manhattan Beach, California]], also started experimenting with [[neoprene]] around 1953.

This type of suit required extra caution while pulling it on because the raw foam-rubber by itself is both fragile and sticky against bare skin. Stretching and pulling excessively easily caused these suits to be torn in half. This was somewhat remedied by thoroughly powdering the suit and the diver's body with [[talc]] to help the rubber slide on more easily.\n\nBacking materials first arrived in the form of nylon sheeting applied to one side of the neoprene. This allowed a swimmer to pull on the suit relatively easily since the tough nylon took most of the strain of pulling on the suit, but the suit still had the black sheet rubber exposed on the outside and the nylon was very stiff and rigid, limiting flexibility. A small strip reversed with the rubber against the skin could help provide a sealing surface to keep water out around the neck, wrists, and ankles.\n\nIn the early 1960s, the British Dunlop Sports Company brought out its yellow Aquafort neoprene wetsuit, whose high visibility was designed to improve diver safety. However, the line was discontinued after a short while and wetsuits reverted to their black uniformity. The colorful wetsuits seen today first arrived in the 1970s when double-backed neoprene was developed. In this material the foam-rubber is sandwiched between two protective fabric outer layers, greatly increasing the tear-resistance. An external layer also meant that decorative colors, logos, and patterns could be made with panels and strips sewn into various shapes. This change from bare flat black rubber to full color took off in the 1980s with brilliant fluorescent colors common on many suits.\n\n===Improvements in suit assembly===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2009}}\nThe first suits used traditional sewing methods to simply overlap two strips of rubber and sew them together. In a rubber wetsuit this does not work well for a number of reasons, the main one being that punching holes straight through both layers of foam for the thread opens up passages for water to flow in and out of the suit. The second problem is that the stretching of the foam tended to enlarge the needle holes when the suit was worn. This meant that a wetsuit could be very cold all along the seams of the suit. And although the sewn edge did hold the two pieces together, it could also act as a [[perforation|perforated]] tear edge, making the suit easier to tear along the seams when putting it on and taking it off.\n\nWhen nylon-backed neoprene appeared, the problem of the needle weakening the foam was solved, but still the needle holes leaked water along the seams.\n\n====Seam taping====\nTo deal with all these early sewing problems, taping of seams was developed. The tape is a strong nylon cloth with a very thin but solid waterproof rubber backing. The tape is applied across the seam and bonded either with a [[chemical solvent]] or with a hot rolling heat-sealer to melt the tape into the neoprene.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\nWith this technology, the suit could be sewn and then taped, and the tape would cover the sewing holes as well as providing some extra strength to prevent tearing along the needle holes.\n\nWhen colorful double-backed designer suits started appearing, taping moved primarily to the inside of the suit because the tape was usually very wide, jagged, black, and ugly, and was hidden within the suit and out of sight.\n\nMany 1960s and 1970s wetsuits were black with visible yellow seam taping. The yellow made the divers more easily seen in dark low-visibility water. To avoid this problem{{clarify|reason=which problem?|date=November 2018}} O'Neill fabricators developed a seam-tape which combined a thin nylon layer with a polyester hemming tape. Applied over the interior of the glued & sewn seam, then anneal bonded with a hand held teflon heating iron produced a seam that was both securely sealed and much stronger.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\n====Seam gluing====\nAnother alternative to sewing was to glue the edges of the suit together. This created a smooth, flat surface that did not necessarily need taping, but unfortunately, raw foam glued to foam is not a strong bond and still prone to tearing.\n\nMost early wetsuits were fabricated completely by hand, which could lead to sizing errors in the cutting of the foam sheeting. If the cut edges did not align correctly or the gluing was not done well, there might still be water leakage along the seam.\n\nInitially, suits could be found as being sewn only, glued only, taped only, then also sewn and taped, or glued and taped, or perhaps all three.\n\n====Blindstitch revolution====\nSometime after nylon-backed neoprene appeared, the [[Overlock|blind stitch]] method was developed. A blindstitch sewing machine uses a curved needle, which does not go all the way through the neoprene but just shallowly dips in behind the fabric backing, crosses the glue line, and emerges from the surface on the same side of the neoprene.<ref name=wetsuitswork/> This is similar to the [[overlock]] stitching used for teeshirts and other garments made from knitted fabrics.\n\nThe curved needle allows the fabric backing to be sewn together without punching a hole completely through the neoprene, and thereby eliminating the water-leakage holes along the seam. Blindstitch seams also lay flat, butting up the edge of one sheet against another, allowing the material to lay flatter and closer to the skin. For these reasons blindstitching rapidly became the primary method of sewing wetsuits together, with other methods now used mainly for [[decorative]] or [[Fashion|stylistic]] purposes.\n\n===Further advances in suit design===\nHighly [[elasticity (physics)|elastic]] fabrics such as [[spandex|spandex (also known as lycra)]] have mostly replaced raw nylon backing, since the nylon by itself cannot be stretched and makes the neoprene very stiff. Incorporating Lycra into the backing permits a large amount of stretching that does not damage the suit, and allowed suits to become closer fitting.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\nAfter the development of double-backed neoprene, singled-backed neoprene still had its uses for various specific purposes. For example, a thin strip of single-backed wrapped around the leg, neck, and wrist openings of the suit creates a seal that greatly reduces the flushing of water in and out of the suit as the person's body moves. But since the strip is very narrow, it does not drag on the skin of the wearer and thus makes the suit easy to put on and remove. The strip can also be fitted with the smooth side out and folded under to form a seal with a small length of smooth surface against the skin.\n\nAs wetsuit manufacturers continued to design suits, they found ways that the materials could be further optimized and customized. The O'Neill Animal Skin  created in 1974 by then Director of Marketing,  E.J. Armstrong,  was one of the first designs combining a turtle-neck based on the popular Sealsuit  with a flexible lightweight YKK horizontal zipper across the back shoulders similar in concept to the inflatable watertight Supersuit (developed by [[Jack O'Neill (businessman)|Jack O'Neill]] in the late 1960s). The Animal Skin eventually evolved molded rubber patterns bonded onto the exterior of the neoprene sheeting ( a technique E.J. Armstrong perfected for application of the moulded raised rubber Supersuit logo to replace the standard flat decals ). This has been carried on as stylized reinforcing pads of rubber on the knees and elbows to protect the suit from wear, and allows logos to be directly bonded onto raw sheet rubber. Additionally, the Animal Skin's looser fit allowed for the use of a supplemental vest in extreme conditions.\n\nIn the early 1970s [[Gul (watersports)|Gul Wetsuits]] pioneered the one-piece wetsuit named as the steamer. Its name was given because of the steam given off from the suit once taken off allowing heat and water held inside to escape. Today one-piece wetsuits are still sometimes referred to as 'Steamers'.<ref name=\"Gul\" />\n\nIn recent years, manufacturers have experimented by combining various materials with neoprene for additional warmth or flexibility of their suits. These include, but are not limited to, [[spandex]], and [[wool]].\n\nPrecision [[Computer Aided Manufacturing|computer-controlled]] cutting and assembly methods, such as [[Water jet cutter|water-jet cutting]], have allowed ever greater levels of seam precision, permitting designers to use many small individual strips of different colors while still keeping the suit free of bulging and ripples from improper cutting and sewing. Further innovations in CAD (Computer Aided Design) technology allow precision cutting for custom-fit wetsuits.\n\n===Return of single-backed neoprene===\nAs wetsuits continued to evolve, their use was explored in other sports such as open-water swimming and [[triathlons]]. Although double-backed neoprene is strong, the cloth surface is relatively rough and creates a large amount of [[Fluid resistance|drag]] in the water, slowing down the swimmer. A single-backed suit has a [[hydrodynamics|smoother exterior surface which causes less drag]].<ref name=wetsuitswork/> With the advances of elastic Lycra backings and blindstitching, single-backed neoprene suits could be made that outperformed the early versions from the 1970s. Other developments in single-backed wetsuits include the suits designed for [[free-diving]] and [[spearfishing]]. Single lined neoprene is more flexible than double lined. To achieve flexibility and low bulk for a given warmth of suit, they are unlined inside, and the slightly porous raw surface of the neoprene adheres closely to the skin and reduces flushing of the suit. The lined outer surface may be printed with [[camouflage]] patterns for spearfishing and is more resistant to damage while in use.<ref name=\"Ninepin 2016\" />\n\nSome triathlon wetsuits go further, and use rubber-molding and texturing methods to roughen up the surface of the suit on the forearms, to increase forward drag and help pull the swimmer forwards through the water. Extremely thin 1&nbsp;mm neoprene is also often used in the under-arm area, to decrease stretch resistance and reduce strain on the swimmer when they extend their arms out over their head.\n\nWetsuits used for [[caving]] are often single-backed with a textured surface known as \"sharkskin\" which is a thin layer where the neoprene is less expanded. This makes it more [[Wear#Abrasive wear|abrasion]] resistant for squeezing between rocks and doesn't get torn in the way that fabric does.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\nAnother reason to eliminate the external textile backing is to reduce water retention which can increase [[evaporative cooling]] and [[wind chill]] in suits used mainly out of the water.<ref name=\"Ninepin 2016\" />\n\n==Types==\n[[File:Wetsuit tunic with hood and pockets P7100008.JPG|thumb|alt=Sleeveless tunic in thin but abrasion resistant neoprene, with integral hood, two cargo pochets on the sides of the thighs, cross-chest zip closure, front pocket on the torso and opening for access to a dry-suit inflation valve. The tunic is suitable for wearing over most one-piece wetsuits for extra insulation, but mainly to support the cargo pockets and hood.   |Hooded tunic with cargo pockets]]\nDifferent shapes of wetsuit are available, in order of coverage:\n* A sleeveless '''vest''', covering only the torso, provides minimal coverage. Some include an attached hood. These are not usually intended to be worn alone, but as an extra layer over or under a longer wetsuit.\n* A hooded tunic, covering the torso and head, with short legs and either short or no sleeves, is generally intended to be worn over a full suit, and has a zip closure. It may be fitted with pockets for transporting accessories.\n* A '''jacket''' covers the torso and arms, with little to no coverage for the legs. Some jackets have short legs like a shorty, others feature leg holes similar to a woman's [[swimsuit]]. A third style, the '''beavertail''' or [[bodysuit]], has a flap which passes through the crotch and attaches at the front with clips, toggles or velcro [[fastener]]s.  It is worn with (over) or without a long john or trousers. A jacket may include an integral hood, and may have a full or partial front zipper.\n* A '''spring suit'''{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}<!--for spring suit--> covers the torso and has short or long sleeves and short legs.\n* '''[[Trousers]]''' cover the lower torso and legs.\n* A '''short john''', '''shorty''' covers the torso and legs to the knee only; does not have sleeves and is a short legged version of the long john.\n* A '''long john''', '''johnny''', '''johnny suit''', or '''farmer john/jane''' (depending on the gender the suit is designed for) covers the torso and legs only; it resembles a [[bib overall]], hence the nickname.\n* A '''full suit''' or '''steamer'''<ref name=\"steamer\" /> covers the torso and the full length of the arms and legs. Some versions come with sleeves the length of a standard t-shirt and known as a short-sleeved steamer.\n\nSome suits are arranged in two parts; the jacket and long johns can be worn separately in mild conditions or worn together to provide two layers of insulation around the torso in cold conditions. Typically, two-piece cold water wetsuits have 10 to 14&nbsp;mm of material around the torso and 5 to 7&nbsp;mm for the extremities.\n\n===Thickness===\nWetsuits are available in different thicknesses depending on the conditions for which they are intended.<ref name=Williams2003/> The thicker the suit, the warmer it will keep the wearer, but the more it will restrict movement. Because wetsuits offer significant protection from [[jellyfish]], [[coral]], sunburn and other hazards, many divers opt to wear a thin suit which provides minimal insulation (often called a \"[[bodysuit]]\") even when the water is warm enough to comfortably forego insulating garments.<ref name=Williams2003/> A thick suit will restrict mobility, and as the thickness is increased the suit may become impractical, depending on the application. This is one reason why [[dry suit]]s may be preferable for some applications. A wetsuit is normally specified in terms of its [[wikt:thickness|thickness]] and style. For instance, a wetsuit with a [[torso]] thickness of 5&nbsp;mm and a [[limb (anatomy)|limb]] thickness of 3&nbsp;mm will be described as a \"5/3\". With new technologies the neoprene is getting more flexible. Modern 4/3 wetsuits, for instance, may feel as flexible as a 3/2 of only a few years ago. Some suits have extra layers added for key areas such as the lower back. Improved flexibility may come at the cost of greater compressibility, which reduces insulation at depth, but this is only important for diving.\n\n===Surface finish===\nFoam neoprene used for wetsuits is always closed cell, in that the gas bubbles are mostly not connected to each other inside the neoprene. This is necessary to prevent water absorption, and the gas bubbles do most of the insulation. Thick sheets of neoprene are foamed inside a mould, and the surfaces in contact with the mould take on the inverse texture of the mould surfaces. In the early days of wetsuits this was often a diamond pattern or similar, but can also be slick and smooth for low drag and quick drying. The cut surfaces of the foam have a slightly porous mat finish as the cutting process passes through a large number of bubbles, leaving what is called an open cell surface finish, but the bulk of the foam remains closed cell. The open cell finish is the most stretchy and the least tear resistant. It is relatively form fitting and comfortable on the skin, but the porosity encourages bacterial growth if not well washed after use, and the foam surface does not slide freely against skin.<ref name=\"Ninepin 2016\" />\n\nThe cut surfaces are usually bonded to a nylon knit fabric, which provides much greater tear resistance, at the expense of some loss of flexibility. This fabric can be bonded to one or both surfaces in various combinations of weight and colour, and can be thin and relatively smooth and fragile, or thicker and stronger and less stretchy. Fabric lined on one side only is more flexible than double lined.<ref name=\"Ninepin 2016\" />\n\nA specialized kind of wetsuit, with a very smooth (and somewhat delicate) outer surface known as ''smoothskin'', which is the original outer surface of the foamed neoprene block from which the sheets are cut, is used for long distance swimming, triathlon competitive apnoea and bluewater spearfishing. These are designed to maximize the mobility of the limbs while providing both warmth and buoyancy, but the surface is delicate and easily damaged. The slick surface also dries quickly and is least affected by wind chill when out of the water.<ref name=wetsuitswork/><ref name=\"Ninepin 2016\" />\n\nBoth smoothskin and fabric lined surfaces can be printed to produce colour patterns such as camouflage designs, which may give spearfishermen and combat divers an advantage.<ref name=\"Ninepin 2016\" />\n\n===Closures===\nZippers are often used for closure or for providing a close fit at the wrists and ankles, but they also provide leakage points for water. \nJackets may have a full or partial front zipper, or none at all. Full body suits may have a vertical back zipper, a cross-shoulder zipper or a vertical front zipper. Each of these arrangements has some advantages and some disadvantages: \n*The front zipper is easy to operate, but the suit may be difficult to remove from the shoulders without assistance, and the zip is uncomfortable for lying on a surfboard. It is relatively inflexible and placed over a part of the body where a lot of flexibility is desirable. The top of the closure will leak to some extent. The top end of the zip may be easily opened for comfort when the wearer is warm, but the zip may also press into the throat, which can be uncomfortable.\n*Cross shoulder zipper can be made relatively watertight as it has no free ends, and is therefore used in semi-dry wetsuits. It is difficult to operate for the wearer and relatively highly stressed at the shoulders due to arm movement. The zip is also relatively vulnerable to damage from diving harnesses.\n*Cross chest zipper has similar advantages to cross shoulder, but is easy to reach.\n*Vertical back zippers are possibly the most common arrangement as they can be operated with a lanyard. They are relatively comfortable for most applications, the suit is easy to remove, and they place the zipper directly over the spine, which though flexible in bending, does not change much in length. The top of the closure will leak to some extent.\n\n===Sizing and fit===\n\nWetsuits that fit too tightly can cause difficulty breathing or even [[Heart failure|acute cardiac failure]],<ref name=Williams2003/> and a loose fit allows considerable flushing which reduces effectiveness of insulation, so a proper fit is important. The quality of fit is most important for diving as this is where the thickest suits are used and the heat loss is potentially greatest. A diving wetsuit should touch the skin over as much of the body that it covers as comfortably possible, both when the wearer is relaxed and when exercising. This is difficult to achieve and the details of style and cut can affect the quality of fit. Gaps where the suit does not touch the skin will vary in volume as the diver moves and this is a major cause of flushing.\n\nWetsuits are made in several standard adult sizes and for children. Custom fitted suits are produced by many manufacturers to provide a better fit for people for whom a well fitting off-the shelf suit is not available.\n\n==Accessories==\n[[File:Hard soled neoprene wetsuit boots P7100005.jpg|thumb|alt=A pair of wetsuit boots showing hard soles and reinforcement in high-wear areas at the toe and heel, and side zipper closure with a thin neoprene gusset behind the zipper to reduce leakage.|Hard soled wetsuit boots with zip fasteners]]\n\nUsually a wetsuit has no covering for the feet, hands or head, and the diver must wear separate neoprene [[Wetsuit boot|booties]], gloves and hood for additional insulation and environmental protection.  Other accessories to the basic suit include pockets for holding small items and equipment, and knee-pads, to protect the knee area from abrasion and tearing, usually used by working divers. Suits may have abrasion protection pads in other areas depending on the application.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\n===Hoods===\nUsing '''hoods''': in the [[human body temperature|thermal balance of the human body]], the heat loss over the head is at least 20% of the whole balance{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}. Thus, for the sake of thermal protection of the diver, wearing a well-fitting hood is useful, even at fairly moderate water temperatures. Hoods have been reported to cause [[claustrophobia]]<ref name=Williams2003/> in a minority of users, sometimes due to poor fit. The hood should not fit too tightly round the neck. Flushing in the neck area can be reduced by using a hood attached to the top part of the suit, or by having sufficient overlap between the hood and the top part of the suit to constrain flow between the two parts. This can be achieved by tucking a circular flap at the base of the neck of the hood under the top of the suit before closing the zip, or by having a high neck on the suit.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\n===Boots===\n[[Image:WetsuitBootPair.jpg|thumb|right|A pair of zippered wetsuit boots. Note the reinforced sole for protection.]]\nWetsuit boots are worn for various purposes, and may be worn with or without a wetsuit.\n\n====Thermal protection====\nIn many water sports such as [[scuba diving]], [[surfing]], [[kayaking]], [[windsurfing]], [[sailing]] and even [[fishing]], bootees may be worn to keep the feet warm in the same way that a wetsuit would. Insulation is proportional to thickness and thus to how cold the water which the user can tolerate; it may be above or below the standard of 5\u20136&nbsp;mm of [[neoprene]]. In warmer climates where the thermal qualities of the bootee are not so important, a bootee with a thickness of 2\u20133.5&nbsp;mm is common. The leg of the bootee may have a [[zipper]] down one side or may be tightened with a [[velcro]] strap. Where boots are worn with a wetsuit they are usually tucked under the leg of the suit for streamlining, to help hold the zip closed, and to keep foreign objects out.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\n====Foot protection====\nA bootee usually has a reinforced [[Sole (shoe)|sole]] for walking. Typically, this is a solid rubber compound that is thicker and tougher than the neoprene used for the upper part of the bootee but is still flexible. The reinforced sole provides the wearer with some protection and grip when walking across shingle, coral and other rough surfaces.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\n===For scuba diving===\nFor [[scuba diving]] the sole of the bootee should not be so thick that the diver cannot get a [[swimfin|fin]] on over it. Divers wearing bootees use fins with a foot part larger than needed with bare feet. Divers in warm water who do not wear a diving suit sometimes wear bootees so they can wear bigger fins. Diving bootees are typically intended for wear with open-heeled fins, held on by a strap, and usually do not fit into full-footed fins. Neoprene socks may be used with full-footed fins, either to prevent chafing and blisters, or for warmth.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\n====For surfing====\nFor [[surfing]], [[windsurfing]], [[kitesurfing]] and similar sports, bootees are typically worn where the weather is so cold that the surfer would lose some degree of functionality in the feet. The bootee should not restrict the ability of a surfer to grip the board with the toes in the desired manner. Split-toe bootees allow for some improvement in this functionality.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} Reef walkers are small bootees that are only as high as the ankle and generally only 2 to 3.5mm thick. They are designed to allow surfers to get out to waves that break at coral reefs or at rocky beaches.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\n====For kayaking====\nSeveral styles of wetsuit boots are commonly used for [[kayaking]]. Short-cut boots are frequently used in warmer conditions where the boots help give grip and foot protection while launching and portaging. In cold conditions longer wetsuit boots may be used with a [[drysuit]] where they are worn over the rubber drysuit socks.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\n===Gloves===\n[[File:Guanti.jpg|thumb|alt=A pair of neoprene wetsuit gloves|Neoprene wetsuit gloves]]\n{{expand section|date=February 2017}}\nWetsuit gloves are worn to keep the hands warm and to protect the skin while working. They are available in a range of thicknesses. Thicker gloves reduce manual dexterity and limit feel.<ref name=\"Williams2003\" /> Wetsuit gloves are also commonly worn with dry suits. Some divers cut the fingertips of the gloves off on the fingers most used for delicate work like operating the controls on a camera housing.\n\n==See also==\n* {{annotated link|Dry suit}}\n* {{annotated link|Rash guard}}\n* [[Glossary of surfing]]\n\n==Notes==\n\n{{Reflist|group=\"note\"}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n\n<ref name=sfc>{{Best Dive Computer |first=Ukasha |last=Taylor|title=Best Wetsuites For Scuba Diving, UC's inventor of wetsuit, dies |url=https://www.bestdivecomputer.com/best-wetsuits-for-diving |work=San Francisco Chronicle |date=May 11, 2008 |accessdate=May 23, 2008}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Bardy2005\">{{cite journal |last1=Bardy |first1=Erik |last2=Mollendorf |first2=Joseph |last3=Pendergast |first3=David |title=Thermal conductivity and compressive strain of foam neoprene insulation under hydrostatic pressure |journal=Journal of Physics D: Applied Physics |date=October 21, 2005 |volume=38 |issue=20 |pages=3832\u20133840 |doi=10.1088/0022-3727/38/20/009 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Barsky>{{cite journal |author1=Barsky, Steven M |author2=Long, Dick |author3=Stinton, Bob |title=Dry Suit Diving: A Guide to Diving Dry |year=2006 |isbn=0-9674305-6-9 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X8q9ZjJvkH8C |accessdate=2017-06-27 |publisher=Hammerhead Press |location=Ventura, Calif.}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Clark\">{{cite book |author=Robert A.

The insulation properties depend on bubbles of gas enclosed within the material, which reduce its ability to [[Conduction (heat)|conduct heat]]. The bubbles also give the wetsuit a low [[density]], providing buoyancy in water.\n\n[[Hugh Bradner]], a [[University of California, Berkeley]], physicist invented the modern wetsuit in 1952. Wetsuits became available in the mid-1950s and evolved as the relatively fragile foamed neoprene was first backed, and later sandwiched, with thin sheets of tougher material such as nylon or later [[spandex|spandex (also known as lycra)]]. Improvements in the way joints in the wetsuit were made by gluing, taping and blindstitching, helped the suit to remain waterproof and reduce ''flushing'', the replacement of water trapped between suit and body by cold water from the outside.<ref name=wetsuitswork /> Further improvements in the seals at the neck, wrists, ankles and zippers produced a suit known as a \"semi-dry\".\n\nDifferent types of wetsuit are made for different uses and for different temperatures.<ref name=Williams2003 /> Suits range from a thin (2&nbsp;mm or less) \"shortie\", covering just the torso, to a full 8&nbsp;mm semi-dry, usually complemented by neoprene boots, gloves and hood.\n\nThe difference between a wetsuit and a [[dry suit]] is that a wetsuit allows water to enter the suit, while dry suits are designed to prevent water from entering, thus keeping the undergarments dry and preserving their insulating effectiveness.

Nitrogen, like most gases, has very low [[thermal conductivity]] compared to water or to solids,<ref group=\"note\">Nitrogen has a thermal conductivity of 0.024&nbsp;Wm<sup>\u22121</sup>K<sup>\u22121</sup>, the same as air \u2013 {{cite web |url=http://www.engineeringtoolbox.com/thermal-conductivity-d_429.html |title=Thermal conductivity of some common materials |year=2005 |publisher=The Engineering ToolBox |accessdate=August 12, 2009}}</ref> and the small and enclosed nature of the gas bubbles minimizes heat transport through the gas by convection in the same way that cloth fabrics or feathers insulate by reducing convection of enclosed air spaces. The result is that the gas filled cavities restrict heat transfer to mostly conduction, which is partly through bubbles of entrapped gas, thereby greatly reducing heat transfer from the body (or from the layer of warmed water trapped between the body and the wetsuit) to the colder water surrounding the wetsuit.\n\nUncompressed foam neoprene has a typical thermal conductivity in the region of 0.054&nbsp;Wm<sup>\u22121</sup>K<sup>\u22121</sup>, which produces about twice the heat loss of still air, or one-tenth the loss of water. However at a depth of about {{convert|15|m|ft|-1}} of water, the thickness of the neoprene will be halved and its conductivity will be increased by about 50%, allowing heat to be lost at three times the rate at the surface.<ref name=\"Bardy2005\" />\n\nA wetsuit must have a snug fit to work efficiently when immersed; too loose a fit, particularly at the openings (wrists, ankles, neck and overlaps) will allow cold water from the outside to enter when the wearer moves.<ref name=wetsuitswork/> Flexible seals at the suit cuffs aid in preventing heat loss in this fashion. The elasticity of the foamed neoprene and surface textiles allow enough stretch for many people to effectively wear off-the-shelf sizes, but others have to have their suits custom fitted to get a good fit that is not too tight for comfort and safety.\n\nFoamed neoprene is very buoyant, helping swimmers to stay afloat, and for this reason divers need to carry [[Diving weighting system|extra weight]] based on the volume of their suit to achieve neutral [[buoyancy]] near the surface.<ref name=Williams2003/> However, the suit loses thermal protection as the bubbles in the neoprene are compressed at depth<ref name=Monji1989 /><ref group=\"note\">Non-foamed solid neoprene has a thermal conductivity between 0.15&nbsp;Wm<sup>\u22121</sup>K<sup>\u22121</sup> and 0.45&nbsp;Wm<sup>\u22121</sup>K<sup>\u22121</sup> depending on type, not very different from water \u2013 {{cite web |url=http://physics.info/conduction/ |title=Conduction |first=Glenn |last=Elert |year=2008 |work=The Physics Hypertextbook |accessdate=April 27, 2014}}</ref> Buoyancy is also reduced by compression, and scuba divers can correct this  by inflating the [[Buoyancy compensator (diving)|buoyancy compensator]].\n\n=== Semi-dry suits ===\n[[File:MutaSemistagnaCernieraFodera.jpg|thumb|alt=Detail of the zipper of a semi-dry wetsuit, showing one end of an open zipper and the neoprene flaps that cover it on the inside and outside of the suit to protect the zipper, improve comfort, and reduce leakage through the closed zip.|Detail showing zipper attachment, internal flap and cover flap of semi-dry suit]]<!--illustrates a detail described in the text quite well-->\nSemi-dry suits are effectively a wetsuit with reasonably effective seals at wrist, neck, ankles and zipper. The seals limit the amount of water entering and leaving the suit when the wearer moves in the water. The wearer gets wet in a semi-dry suit but the water that enters is soon warmed up and does not leave the suit readily, so the wearer remains warm. The trapped layer of water does not add significantly to the suit's insulating ability. Any residual water circulation past the seals still causes heat loss. Semi-dry suits are cheap and simple compared to dry suits. They are usually made from thick Neoprene, which provides good thermal protection at shallow depth, but lose buoyancy and thermal protection as the gas bubbles in the Neoprene compress at depth. Semi-dry suits can come in various configurations including a one-piece full-body suit or two pieces, made of 'long johns' and a separate 'jacket'.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}<!--for two-piece semi-dry suits--> The zipper is commonly across the shoulders on the back, but other arrangements have been used.

In this case, the water would quickly reach skin temperature and the air in the fabric would continue to act as the thermal insulation to keep it that way. In the popular mind, the layer of water between skin and suit has been credited with providing the insulation. However, Bradner clearly understood that the suit did not need to be wet because it was not the water that provided the insulation but rather the gas in the suit fabric.<ref name=sfc /><ref name=times /> He initially sent his ideas to Lauriston C. \"Larry\" Marshall who was involved in a U.S. Navy/National Research Council Panel on Underwater Swimmers.<ref name=Rainey /> However, it was [[Willard Bascom]], an engineer at the [[Scripps Institution of Oceanography]] in [[La Jolla, California]], who suggested neoprene as a feasible material to Bradner.<ref name=times/>\n\nHowever, Bradner and Bascom were not overly interested in profiting from their design and were unable to successfully market a version to the public.<ref name=times/> They attempted to patent their neoprene wetsuit design, but their application was rejected because the design was viewed as too similar to a [[flight suit]].<ref name=times/> The [[United States Navy]] also turned down Bradner's and Bascom's offer to supply its swimmers and frogmen with the new wetsuits due to concerns that the gas in the neoprene component of the suits might make it easier for naval divers to be detected by underwater [[sonar]].<ref name=times/> The first written documentation of Bradner's invention was in a letter to Marshall, dated June 21, 1951.<ref name=Rainey/>\n\n[[Jack O'Neill (businessman)|Jack O'Neill]] started using closed-cell neoprene foam which was shown to him by his bodysurfing friend, Harry Hind, who knew of it as an insulating material in his laboratory work.{{citation needed|date=May 2010|reason=this text replaced differing content, albeit weakly sourced}} After experimenting with the material and finding it superior to other insulating foams, O'Neill founded the successful wetsuit manufacturing company called [[O'Neill (brand)|''O'Neill'']] in a San Francisco garage in 1952, later relocating to Santa Cruz, California<ref name=santacruzwetsuits /> in 1959 with the motto \"It's Always Summer on the Inside\".<ref name=\"surfline\" /><ref name=\"O'Neill\" /> Bob and [[Bill Meistrell]], from [[Manhattan Beach, California]], also started experimenting with [[neoprene]] around 1953.

This type of suit required extra caution while pulling it on because the raw foam-rubber by itself is both fragile and sticky against bare skin. Stretching and pulling excessively easily caused these suits to be torn in half. This was somewhat remedied by thoroughly powdering the suit and the diver's body with [[talc]] to help the rubber slide on more easily.\n\nBacking materials first arrived in the form of nylon sheeting applied to one side of the neoprene. This allowed a swimmer to pull on the suit relatively easily since the tough nylon took most of the strain of pulling on the suit, but the suit still had the black sheet rubber exposed on the outside and the nylon was very stiff and rigid, limiting flexibility. A small strip reversed with the rubber against the skin could help provide a sealing surface to keep water out around the neck, wrists, and ankles.\n\nIn the early 1960s, the British Dunlop Sports Company brought out its yellow Aquafort neoprene wetsuit, whose high visibility was designed to improve diver safety. However, the line was discontinued after a short while and wetsuits reverted to their black uniformity. The colorful wetsuits seen today first arrived in the 1970s when double-backed neoprene was developed. In this material the foam-rubber is sandwiched between two protective fabric outer layers, greatly increasing the tear-resistance. An external layer also meant that decorative colors, logos, and patterns could be made with panels and strips sewn into various shapes. This change from bare flat black rubber to full color took off in the 1980s with brilliant fluorescent colors common on many suits.\n\n===Improvements in suit assembly===\n{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2009}}\nThe first suits used traditional sewing methods to simply overlap two strips of rubber and sew them together. In a rubber wetsuit this does not work well for a number of reasons, the main one being that punching holes straight through both layers of foam for the thread opens up passages for water to flow in and out of the suit. The second problem is that the stretching of the foam tended to enlarge the needle holes when the suit was worn. This meant that a wetsuit could be very cold all along the seams of the suit. And although the sewn edge did hold the two pieces together, it could also act as a [[perforation|perforated]] tear edge, making the suit easier to tear along the seams when putting it on and taking it off.\n\nWhen nylon-backed neoprene appeared, the problem of the needle weakening the foam was solved, but still the needle holes leaked water along the seams.\n\n====Seam taping====\nTo deal with all these early sewing problems, taping of seams was developed. The tape is a strong nylon cloth with a very thin but solid waterproof rubber backing. The tape is applied across the seam and bonded either with a [[chemical solvent]] or with a hot rolling heat-sealer to melt the tape into the neoprene.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\nWith this technology, the suit could be sewn and then taped, and the tape would cover the sewing holes as well as providing some extra strength to prevent tearing along the needle holes.\n\nWhen colorful double-backed designer suits started appearing, taping moved primarily to the inside of the suit because the tape was usually very wide, jagged, black, and ugly, and was hidden within the suit and out of sight.\n\nMany 1960s and 1970s wetsuits were black with visible yellow seam taping. The yellow made the divers more easily seen in dark low-visibility water. To avoid this problem{{clarify|reason=which problem?|date=November 2018}} O'Neill fabricators developed a seam-tape which combined a thin nylon layer with a polyester hemming tape. Applied over the interior of the glued & sewn seam, then anneal bonded with a hand held teflon heating iron produced a seam that was both securely sealed and much stronger.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\n====Seam gluing====\nAnother alternative to sewing was to glue the edges of the suit together. This created a smooth, flat surface that did not necessarily need taping, but unfortunately, raw foam glued to foam is not a strong bond and still prone to tearing.\n\nMost early wetsuits were fabricated completely by hand, which could lead to sizing errors in the cutting of the foam sheeting. If the cut edges did not align correctly or the gluing was not done well, there might still be water leakage along the seam.\n\nInitially, suits could be found as being sewn only, glued only, taped only, then also sewn and taped, or glued and taped, or perhaps all three.\n\n====Blindstitch revolution====\nSometime after nylon-backed neoprene appeared, the [[Overlock|blind stitch]] method was developed. A blindstitch sewing machine uses a curved needle, which does not go all the way through the neoprene but just shallowly dips in behind the fabric backing, crosses the glue line, and emerges from the surface on the same side of the neoprene.<ref name=wetsuitswork/> This is similar to the [[overlock]] stitching used for teeshirts and other garments made from knitted fabrics.\n\nThe curved needle allows the fabric backing to be sewn together without punching a hole completely through the neoprene, and thereby eliminating the water-leakage holes along the seam. Blindstitch seams also lay flat, butting up the edge of one sheet against another, allowing the material to lay flatter and closer to the skin. For these reasons blindstitching rapidly became the primary method of sewing wetsuits together, with other methods now used mainly for [[decorative]] or [[Fashion|stylistic]] purposes.\n\n===Further advances in suit design===\nHighly [[elasticity (physics)|elastic]] fabrics such as [[spandex|spandex (also known as lycra)]] have mostly replaced raw nylon backing, since the nylon by itself cannot be stretched and makes the neoprene very stiff. Incorporating Lycra into the backing permits a large amount of stretching that does not damage the suit, and allowed suits to become closer fitting.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\nAfter the development of double-backed neoprene, singled-backed neoprene still had its uses for various specific purposes. For example, a thin strip of single-backed wrapped around the leg, neck, and wrist openings of the suit creates a seal that greatly reduces the flushing of water in and out of the suit as the person's body moves. But since the strip is very narrow, it does not drag on the skin of the wearer and thus makes the suit easy to put on and remove. The strip can also be fitted with the smooth side out and folded under to form a seal with a small length of smooth surface against the skin.\n\nAs wetsuit manufacturers continued to design suits, they found ways that the materials could be further optimized and customized. The O'Neill Animal Skin  created in 1974 by then Director of Marketing,  E.J. Armstrong,  was one of the first designs combining a turtle-neck based on the popular Sealsuit  with a flexible lightweight YKK horizontal zipper across the back shoulders similar in concept to the inflatable watertight Supersuit (developed by [[Jack O'Neill (businessman)|Jack O'Neill]] in the late 1960s). The Animal Skin eventually evolved molded rubber patterns bonded onto the exterior of the neoprene sheeting ( a technique E.J. Armstrong perfected for application of the moulded raised rubber Supersuit logo to replace the standard flat decals ). This has been carried on as stylized reinforcing pads of rubber on the knees and elbows to protect the suit from wear, and allows logos to be directly bonded onto raw sheet rubber. Additionally, the Animal Skin's looser fit allowed for the use of a supplemental vest in extreme conditions.\n\nIn the early 1970s [[Gul (watersports)|Gul Wetsuits]] pioneered the one-piece wetsuit named as the steamer. Its name was given because of the steam given off from the suit once taken off allowing heat and water held inside to escape. Today one-piece wetsuits are still sometimes referred to as 'Steamers'.<ref name=\"Gul\" />\n\nIn recent years, manufacturers have experimented by combining various materials with neoprene for additional warmth or flexibility of their suits. These include, but are not limited to, [[spandex]], and [[wool]].\n\nPrecision [[Computer Aided Manufacturing|computer-controlled]] cutting and assembly methods, such as [[Water jet cutter|water-jet cutting]], have allowed ever greater levels of seam precision, permitting designers to use many small individual strips of different colors while still keeping the suit free of bulging and ripples from improper cutting and sewing. Further innovations in CAD (Computer Aided Design) technology allow precision cutting for custom-fit wetsuits.\n\n===Return of single-backed neoprene===\nAs wetsuits continued to evolve, their use was explored in other sports such as open-water swimming and [[triathlons]]. Although double-backed neoprene is strong, the cloth surface is relatively rough and creates a large amount of [[Fluid resistance|drag]] in the water, slowing down the swimmer. A single-backed suit has a [[hydrodynamics|smoother exterior surface which causes less drag]].<ref name=wetsuitswork/> With the advances of elastic Lycra backings and blindstitching, single-backed neoprene suits could be made that outperformed the early versions from the 1970s. Other developments in single-backed wetsuits include the suits designed for [[free-diving]] and [[spearfishing]]. Single lined neoprene is more flexible than double lined. To achieve flexibility and low bulk for a given warmth of suit, they are unlined inside, and the slightly porous raw surface of the neoprene adheres closely to the skin and reduces flushing of the suit. The lined outer surface may be printed with [[camouflage]] patterns for spearfishing and is more resistant to damage while in use.<ref name=\"Ninepin 2016\" />\n\nSome triathlon wetsuits go further, and use rubber-molding and texturing methods to roughen up the surface of the suit on the forearms, to increase forward drag and help pull the swimmer forwards through the water. Extremely thin 1&nbsp;mm neoprene is also often used in the under-arm area, to decrease stretch resistance and reduce strain on the swimmer when they extend their arms out over their head.\n\nWetsuits used for [[caving]] are often single-backed with a textured surface known as \"sharkskin\" which is a thin layer where the neoprene is less expanded. This makes it more [[Wear#Abrasive wear|abrasion]] resistant for squeezing between rocks and doesn't get torn in the way that fabric does.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}\n\nAnother reason to eliminate the external textile backing is to reduce water retention which can increase [[evaporative cooling]] and [[wind chill]] in suits used mainly out of the water.<ref name=\"Ninepin 2016\" />\n\n==Types==\n[[File:Wetsuit tunic with hood and pockets P7100008.JPG|thumb|alt=Sleeveless tunic in thin but abrasion resistant neoprene, with integral hood, two cargo pochets on the sides of the thighs, cross-chest zip closure, front pocket on the torso and opening for access to a dry-suit inflation valve. The tunic is suitable for wearing over most one-piece wetsuits for extra insulation, but mainly to support the cargo pockets and hood.   |Hooded tunic with cargo pockets]]\nDifferent shapes of wetsuit are available, in order of coverage:\n* A sleeveless '''vest''', covering only the torso, provides minimal coverage. Some include an attached hood. These are not usually intended to be worn alone, but as an extra layer over or under a longer wetsuit.\n* A hooded tunic, covering the torso and head, with short legs and either short or no sleeves, is generally intended to be worn over a full suit, and has a zip closure. It may be fitted with pockets for transporting accessories.\n* A '''jacket''' covers the torso and arms, with little to no coverage for the legs. Some jackets have short legs like a shorty, others feature leg holes similar to a woman's [[swimsuit]]. A third style, the '''beavertail''' or [[bodysuit]], has a flap which passes through the crotch and attaches at the front with clips, toggles or velcro [[fastener]]s.  It is worn with (over) or without a long john or trousers. A jacket may include an integral hood, and may have a full or partial front zipper.\n* A '''spring suit'''{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}<!--for spring suit--> covers the torso and has short or long sleeves and short legs.\n* '''[[Trousers]]''' cover the lower torso and legs.\n* A '''short john''', '''shorty''' covers the torso and legs to the knee only; does not have sleeves and is a short legged version of the long john.\n* A '''long john''', '''johnny''', '''johnny suit''', or '''farmer john/jane''' (depending on the gender the suit is designed for) covers the torso and legs only; it resembles a [[bib overall]], hence the nickname.\n* A '''full suit''' or '''steamer'''<ref name=\"steamer\" /> covers the torso and the full length of the arms and legs. Some versions come with sleeves the length of a standard t-shirt and known as a short-sleeved steamer.\n\nSome suits are arranged in two parts; the jacket and long johns can be worn separately in mild conditions or worn together to provide two layers of insulation around the torso in cold conditions. Typically, two-piece cold water wetsuits have 10 to 14&nbsp;mm of material around the torso and 5 to 7&nbsp;mm for the extremities.\n\n===Thickness===\nWetsuits are available in different thicknesses depending on the conditions for which they are intended.<ref name=Williams2003/> The thicker the suit, the warmer it will keep the wearer, but the more it will restrict movement. Because wetsuits offer significant protection from [[jellyfish]], [[coral]], sunburn and other hazards, many divers opt to wear a thin suit which provides minimal insulation (often called a \"[[bodysuit]]\") even when the water is warm enough to comfortably forego insulating garments.<ref name=Williams2003/> A thick suit will restrict mobility, and as the thickness is increased the suit may become impractical, depending on the application. This is one reason why [[dry suit]]s may be preferable for some applications. A wetsuit is normally specified in terms of its [[wikt:thickness|thickness]] and style. For instance, a wetsuit with a [[torso]] thickness of 5&nbsp;mm and a [[limb (anatomy)|limb]] thickness of 3&nbsp;mm will be described as a \"5/3\". With new technologies the neoprene is getting more flexible. Modern 4/3 wetsuits, for instance, may feel as flexible as a 3/2 of only a few years ago. Some suits have extra layers added for key areas such as the lower back. Improved flexibility may come at the cost of greater compressibility, which reduces insulation at depth, but this is only important for diving.\n\n===Surface finish===\nFoam neoprene used for wetsuits is always closed cell, in that the gas bubbles are mostly not connected to each other inside the neoprene. This is necessary to prevent water absorption, and the gas bubbles do most of the insulation. Thick sheets of neoprene are foamed inside a mould, and the surfaces in contact with the mould take on the inverse texture of the mould surfaces. In the early days of wetsuits this was often a diamond pattern or similar, but can also be slick and smooth for low drag and quick drying. The cut surfaces of the foam have a slightly porous mat finish as the cutting process passes through a large number of bubbles, leaving what is called an open cell surface finish, but the bulk of the foam remains closed cell. The open cell finish is the most stretchy and the least tear resistant. It is relatively form fitting and comfortable on the skin, but the porosity encourages bacterial growth if not well washed after use, and the foam surface does not slide freely against skin.<ref name=\"Ninepin 2016\" />\n\nThe cut surfaces are usually bonded to a nylon knit fabric, which provides much greater tear resistance, at the expense of some loss of flexibility. This fabric can be bonded to one or both surfaces in various combinations of weight and colour, and can be thin and relatively smooth and fragile, or thicker and stronger and less stretchy. Fabric lined on one side only is more flexible than double lined.<ref name=\"Ninepin 2016\" />\n\nA specialized kind of wetsuit, with a very smooth (and somewhat delicate) outer surface known as ''smoothskin'', which is the original outer surface of the foamed neoprene block from which the sheets are cut, is used for long distance swimming, triathlon competitive apnoea and bluewater spearfishing. These are designed to maximize the mobility of the limbs while providing both warmth and buoyancy, but the surface is delicate and easily damaged. The slick surface also dries quickly and is least affected by wind chill when out of the water.<ref name=wetsuitswork/><ref name=\"Ninepin 2016\" />\n\nBoth smoothskin and fabric lined surfaces can be printed to produce colour patterns such as camouflage designs, which may give spearfishermen and combat divers an advantage.<ref name=\"Ninepin 2016\" />\n\n===Closures===\nZippers are often used for closure or for providing a close fit at the wrists and ankles, but they also provide leakage points for water. \nJackets may have a full or partial front zipper, or none at all. Full body suits may have a vertical back zipper, a cross-shoulder zipper or a vertical front zipper. Each of these arrangements has some advantages and some disadvantages: \n*The front zipper is easy to operate, but the suit may be difficult to remove from the shoulders without assistance, and the zip is uncomfortable for lying on a surfboard. It is relatively inflexible and placed over a part of the body where a lot of flexibility is desirable. The top of the closure will leak to some extent. The top end of the zip may be easily opened for comfort when the wearer is warm, but the zip may also press into the throat, which can be uncomfortable.\n*Cross shoulder zipper can be made relatively watertight as it has no free ends, and is therefore used in semi-dry wetsuits. It is difficult to operate for the wearer and relatively highly stressed at the shoulders due to arm movement. The zip is also relatively vulnerable to damage from diving harnesses.\n*Cross chest zipper has similar advantages to cross shoulder, but is easy to reach.\n*Vertical back zippers are possibly the most common arrangement as they can be operated with a lanyard. They are relatively comfortable for most applications, the suit is easy to remove, and they place the zipper directly over the spine, which though flexible in bending, does not change much in length. The top of the closure will leak to some extent.\n\n===Sizing and fit===\n\nWetsuits that fit too tightly can cause difficulty breathing or even [[Heart failure|acute cardiac failure]],<ref name=Williams2003/> and a loose fit allows considerable flushing which reduces effectiveness of insulation, so a proper fit is important. The quality of fit is most important for diving as this is where the thickest suits are used and the heat loss is potentially greatest. A diving wetsuit should touch the skin over as much of the body that it covers as comfortably possible, both when the wearer is relaxed and when exercising. This is difficult to achieve and the details of style and cut can affect the quality of fit. Gaps where the suit does not touch the skin will vary in volume as the diver moves and this is a major cause of flushing.\n\nWetsuits are made in several standard adult sizes and for children. Custom fitted suits are produced by many manufacturers to provide a better fit for people for whom a well fitting off-the shelf suit is not available.\n\n==Accessories==\n[[File:Hard soled neoprene wetsuit boots P7100005.jpg|thumb|alt=A pair of wetsuit boots showing hard soles and reinforcement in high-wear areas at the toe and heel, and side zipper closure with a thin neoprene gusset behind the zipper to reduce leakage.|Hard soled wetsuit boots with zip fasteners]]\n\nUsually a wetsuit has no covering for the feet, hands or head, and the diver must wear separate neoprene [[Wetsuit boot|booties]], gloves and hood for additional insulation and environmental protection.  Other accessories to the basic suit include pockets for holding small items and equipment, and knee-pads, to protect the knee area from abrasion and tearing, usually used by working divers. Suits may have abrasion protection pads in other areas depending on the application.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\n===Hoods===\nUsing '''hoods''': in the [[human body temperature|thermal balance of the human body]], the heat loss over the head is at least 20% of the whole balance{{citation needed|date=April 2012}}. Thus, for the sake of thermal protection of the diver, wearing a well-fitting hood is useful, even at fairly moderate water temperatures. Hoods have been reported to cause [[claustrophobia]]<ref name=Williams2003/> in a minority of users, sometimes due to poor fit. The hood should not fit too tightly round the neck. Flushing in the neck area can be reduced by using a hood attached to the top part of the suit, or by having sufficient overlap between the hood and the top part of the suit to constrain flow between the two parts. This can be achieved by tucking a circular flap at the base of the neck of the hood under the top of the suit before closing the zip, or by having a high neck on the suit.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\n===Boots===\n[[Image:WetsuitBootPair.jpg|thumb|right|A pair of zippered wetsuit boots. Note the reinforced sole for protection.]]\nWetsuit boots are worn for various purposes, and may be worn with or without a wetsuit.\n\n====Thermal protection====\nIn many water sports such as [[scuba diving]], [[surfing]], [[kayaking]], [[windsurfing]], [[sailing]] and even [[fishing]], bootees may be worn to keep the feet warm in the same way that a wetsuit would. Insulation is proportional to thickness and thus to how cold the water which the user can tolerate; it may be above or below the standard of 5\u20136&nbsp;mm of [[neoprene]]. In warmer climates where the thermal qualities of the bootee are not so important, a bootee with a thickness of 2\u20133.5&nbsp;mm is common. The leg of the bootee may have a [[zipper]] down one side or may be tightened with a [[velcro]] strap. Where boots are worn with a wetsuit they are usually tucked under the leg of the suit for streamlining, to help hold the zip closed, and to keep foreign objects out.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\n====Foot protection====\nA bootee usually has a reinforced [[Sole (shoe)|sole]] for walking. Typically, this is a solid rubber compound that is thicker and tougher than the neoprene used for the upper part of the bootee but is still flexible. The reinforced sole provides the wearer with some protection and grip when walking across shingle, coral and other rough surfaces.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\n===For scuba diving===\nFor [[scuba diving]] the sole of the bootee should not be so thick that the diver cannot get a [[swimfin|fin]] on over it. Divers wearing bootees use fins with a foot part larger than needed with bare feet. Divers in warm water who do not wear a diving suit sometimes wear bootees so they can wear bigger fins. Diving bootees are typically intended for wear with open-heeled fins, held on by a strap, and usually do not fit into full-footed fins. Neoprene socks may be used with full-footed fins, either to prevent chafing and blisters, or for warmth.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\n====For surfing====\nFor [[surfing]], [[windsurfing]], [[kitesurfing]] and similar sports, bootees are typically worn where the weather is so cold that the surfer would lose some degree of functionality in the feet. The bootee should not restrict the ability of a surfer to grip the board with the toes in the desired manner. Split-toe bootees allow for some improvement in this functionality.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}} Reef walkers are small bootees that are only as high as the ankle and generally only 2 to 3.5mm thick. They are designed to allow surfers to get out to waves that break at coral reefs or at rocky beaches.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\n====For kayaking====\nSeveral styles of wetsuit boots are commonly used for [[kayaking]]. Short-cut boots are frequently used in warmer conditions where the boots help give grip and foot protection while launching and portaging. In cold conditions longer wetsuit boots may be used with a [[drysuit]] where they are worn over the rubber drysuit socks.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}\n\n===Gloves===\n[[File:Guanti.jpg|thumb|alt=A pair of neoprene wetsuit gloves|Neoprene wetsuit gloves]]\n{{expand section|date=February 2017}}\nWetsuit gloves are worn to keep the hands warm and to protect the skin while working. They are available in a range of thicknesses. Thicker gloves reduce manual dexterity and limit feel.<ref name=\"Williams2003\" /> Wetsuit gloves are also commonly worn with dry suits. Some divers cut the fingertips of the gloves off on the fingers most used for delicate work like operating the controls on a camera housing.\n\n==See also==\n* {{annotated link|Dry suit}}\n* {{annotated link|Rash guard}}\n* [[Glossary of surfing]]\n\n==Notes==\n\n{{Reflist|group=\"note\"}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|refs=\n\n<ref name=\"Bardy2005\">{{cite journal |last1=Bardy |first1=Erik |last2=Mollendorf |first2=Joseph |last3=Pendergast |first3=David |title=Thermal conductivity and compressive strain of foam neoprene insulation under hydrostatic pressure |journal=Journal of Physics D: Applied Physics |date=October 21, 2005 |volume=38 |issue=20 |pages=3832\u20133840 |doi=10.1088/0022-3727/38/20/009 }}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Barsky>{{cite journal |author1=Barsky, Steven M |author2=Long, Dick |author3=Stinton, Bob |title=Dry Suit Diving: A Guide to Diving Dry |year=2006 |isbn=0-9674305-6-9 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X8q9ZjJvkH8C |accessdate=2017-06-27 |publisher=Hammerhead Press |location=Ventura, Calif.}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Clark\">{{cite book |author=Robert A.
