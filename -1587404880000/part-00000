The advent of civilization allowed the [[domestication of animals]] such as chickens, sheep, rabbits, pigs and cattle. This eventually led to their use in meat production on an industrial scale with the aid of [[slaughterhouse]]s.\n\nMeat is mainly composed of water, [[protein]], and [[fat]]. It is edible raw, but is normally eaten after it has been cooked and seasoned or processed in a variety of ways. Unprocessed meat will [[Meat spoilage|spoil or rot]] within hours or days as a result of infection with and decomposition by [[bacteria]] and [[Fungus|fungi]].\n\nMeat is important in economy and culture, even though its mass production and consumption has been determined to pose risks for human health and the environment. Many religions have rules about which meat may or may not be eaten.

The word ''mete'' also exists in [[Old Frisian]] (and to a lesser extent, modern [[West Frisian language|West Frisian]]) to denote important food, differentiating it from ''swiets'' (sweets) and ''dierfied'' (animal feed).\n\nMost often, ''meat'' refers to [[skeletal muscle]] and associated [[fat]] and other tissues, but it may also describe other edible tissues such as [[offal]].<ref name=\"Lawrie\" />{{rp|1}} ''Meat'' is sometimes also used in a more restrictive sense to mean the flesh of [[mammal]]ian species (pigs, cattle, lambs, etc.) raised and prepared for human consumption, to the exclusion of [[Fish as food|fish]], other [[seafood]], [[entomophagy|insects]], [[poultry]], or other animals.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/meat|title=Meat definition and meaning {{!}} Collins English Dictionary|website=www.collinsdictionary.com|language=en|access-date=June 16, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170712041548/https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/meat|archive-date=July 12, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"Definition of MEAT\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/meat|title=Definition of MEAT|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|access-date=June 16, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180319025828/https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/meat|archive-date=March 19, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn the context of food, ''meat'' can also refer to \"the edible part of something as distinguished from its covering (such as a husk or shell)\", for example, ''coconut meat''.<ref name=\"Definition of MEAT\"/>\n\n== History ==\n===Hunting and farming===\n{{See also|History of agriculture}}\n[[Paleontology|Paleontological]] evidence suggests that meat constituted a substantial proportion of the diet of the earliest humans.<ref name=\"Lawrie\" />{{rp|2}} Early [[hunter-gatherer]]s depended on the organized hunting of large animals such as [[bison]] and [[deer]].<ref name=\"Lawrie\" />{{rp|2}}\n\nThe [[domestication]] of animals, of which we have evidence dating back to the end of the [[last glacial period]] (c. 10,000 BCE),<ref name=\"Lawrie\" />{{rp|2}} allowed the systematic production of meat and the [[animal husbandry|breeding]] of animals with a view to improving meat production.<ref name=\"Lawrie\" />{{rp|2}} Animals that are now principal sources of meat were domesticated in conjunction with the development of early civilizations:\n[[File:Lamb meat.jpg|thumb|right|A typical shoulder cut of [[Lamb and mutton|lamb]]]]\n* [[Sheep]], originating from western Asia, were domesticated with the help of dogs prior to the establishment of settled [[agriculture]], likely as early as the 8th millennium BCE.<ref name=\"Lawrie\" />{{rp|3}} Several breeds of sheep were established in ancient [[Mesopotamia]] and [[ancient Egypt|Egypt]] by 3500\u20133000 BCE.<ref name=\"Lawrie\" />{{rp|3}} Today, more than 200 [[List of sheep breeds|sheep-breeds]] exist.\n* [[Cattle]] were domesticated in Mesopotamia after settled agriculture was established about 5000 BCE,<ref name=\"Lawrie\" />{{rp|5}} and several breeds were established by 2500 BCE.<ref name=\"Lawrie\" />{{rp|6}} Modern domesticated cattle fall into the groups ''[[Cattle|Bos taurus]]'' (European cattle) and ''[[Zebu|Bos taurus indicus]]'' (zebu), both descended from the now-extinct [[aurochs]].<ref name=\"Lawrie\" />{{rp|5}} The breeding of [[beef cattle]], cattle optimized for meat production as opposed to animals best suited for work or dairy purposes, began in the middle of the 18th century.<ref name=\"Lawrie\" />{{rp|7}}\n[[File:Hereford bull large.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Hereford (cattle)|Hereford]] bull, a breed of cattle frequently used in beef production.]]\n* [[Domestic pig]]s, which are descended from [[wild boar]]s, are known to have existed about 2500 BCE in modern-day Hungary and in [[Troy]]; earlier pottery from [[Tell es-Sultan]] (Jericho) and Egypt depicts wild pigs.<ref name=\"Lawrie\" />{{rp|8}} [[Pork]] sausages and [[ham]]s were of great commercial importance in [[Greco-Roman world|Greco-Roman]] times.<ref name=\"Lawrie\" />{{rp|8}} Pigs continue to be bred intensively as they are being optimized to produce meat best suited for specific meat products.<ref name=\"Lawrie\" />{{rp|9}}\n\n[[File:Dog meat at Gyeongdong Market.jpg|thumb|Dog meat sold at [[Gyeongdong Market]], Seoul, South Korea]]{{World laws on killing dogs for consumption}}\nOther animals are or have been raised or hunted for their flesh.

[[Plato]]'s ''[[Republic]]'' has [[Socrates]] describe the ideal state as vegetarian. [[Pythagoras]] believed that humans and animals were equal and therefore disapproved of meat consumption, as did [[Plutarch]], whereas [[Zeno of Elea|Zeno]] and [[Epicurus]] were [[vegetarian]] but allowed meat-eating in their philosophy.{{r|Buscemi|p=10}} Conversely, [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]'' assert that animals, as inferior beings, exist to serve humans, including as food. [[Augustine]] drew on Aristotle to argue that the universe's natural hierarchy allows humans to eat animals, and animals to eat plants.{{r|Buscemi|p=10}} [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] philosophers were likewise divided. [[Descartes]] wrote that animals are merely animated machines, and [[Kant]] considered them inferior beings for lack of discernment; means rather than ends.{{r|Buscemi|p=11}} But [[Voltaire]] and [[Rousseau]] disagreed. The latter argued that meat-eating is a social rather than a natural act, because children are not interested in meat.{{r|Buscemi|p=11}}\n\nLater philosophers examined the changing practices of eating meat in the [[modern age]] as part of a process of detachment from animals as living beings. [[Norbert Elias]], for instance, noted that in medieval times cooked animals were brought to the table whole, but that since the [[Renaissance]] only the edible parts are served, which are no longer recognizably part of an animal.{{r|Buscemi|p=12}} Modern eaters, according to [[:fr:No\u00eblie Vialles|No\u00eblie Vialles]], demand an \"[[Ellipsis (linguistics)|ellipsis]]\" between meat and dead animals; for instance, calves' eyes are no longer considered a delicacy as in the Middle Ages, but provoke disgust.{{r|Buscemi|p=12}} Even in the English language, distinctions emerged between animals and their meat, such as between [[cattle]] and [[beef]], [[pig]]s and [[pork]].{{r|Buscemi|p=12}} [[Fernand Braudel]] wrote that since the European diet of the 15th and 16th century was particularly heavy in meat, European [[colonialism]] helped export meat-eating across the globe, as colonized peoples took up the culinary habits of their colonizers, which they associated with wealth and power.{{r|Buscemi|p=15}}\n\n== Consumption ==\n{{further|List of countries by meat consumption per capita|List of countries by meat consumption}}{{Bar chart|title=Number of Land Animals Killed for Meat in 2013<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/QL|title=FAOSTAT|website=www.fao.org|access-date=2019-10-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170511194947/http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/QL|archive-date=May 11, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>|float=right|label_type=Animals|data_type=Number Killed|bar_width=20|width_units=em|data_max=61171973510|label1=Chickens|data1=61171973510|label2=Ducks|data2=2887594480|label3=Pigs|data3=1451856889|label4=Rabbits|data4=1171578000|label5=Geese|data5=687147000|label6=Turkeys|data6=618086890|label7=Sheep|data7=536742256|label8=Goats|data8=438320370|label9=Cattle|data9=298799160|label10=Rodents|data10=70371000|label11=Pigeons and other birds|data11=59656000|label12=Buffalo|data12=25798819|label13=Horses|data13=4863367|label14=Donkeys and mules|data14=3478300|label15=Camels and other camelids|data15=3298266}}Meat consumption varies worldwide, depending on cultural or religious preferences, as well as economic conditions.

Multiple asexual reproduction of animals bearing desirable traits is anticipated,<ref name=\"Lawrie\" />{{rp|22}} although this is not yet practical on a commercial scale.\n\n=== Environment ===\nHeat regulation in [[livestock]] is of great economic significance, because mammals attempt to maintain a constant optimal body temperature. Low temperatures tend to prolong animal development and high temperatures tend to retard it.<ref name=\"Lawrie\" />{{rp|22}} Depending on their size, body shape and insulation through tissue and fur, some animals have a relatively narrow zone of temperature tolerance and others (e.g. cattle) a broad one.<ref name=\"Lawrie\" />{{rp|23}} Static [[magnetic field]]s, for reasons still unknown, also retard animal development.<ref name=\"Lawrie\" />{{rp|23}}\n\n=== Nutrition ===\nThe quality and quantity of usable meat depends on the animal's ''plane of nutrition'', i.e., whether it is over- or underfed. Scientists disagree about how exactly the plane of nutrition influences carcass composition.<ref name=\"Lawrie\" />{{rp|25}}\n\nThe composition of the diet, especially the amount of protein provided, is also an important factor regulating animal growth.<ref name=\"Lawrie\" />{{rp|26}}  [[Ruminant]]s, which may digest [[cellulose]], are better adapted to poor-quality diets, but their ruminal microorganisms degrade high-quality protein if supplied in excess.<ref name=\"Lawrie\" />{{rp|27}} Because producing high-quality protein animal feed is expensive (see also ''[[Meat#Environmental impact|Environmental impact]]'' below), several techniques are employed or experimented with to ensure maximum utilization of protein. These include the treatment of feed with [[Formaldehyde|formalin]] to protect [[amino acid]]s during their passage through the [[rumen]], the recycling of [[manure]] by feeding it back to cattle mixed with feed concentrates, or the partial conversion of [[petroleum]] [[hydrocarbon]]s to protein through microbial action.<ref name=\"Lawrie\" />{{rp|30}}\n\nIn plant feed, environmental factors influence the availability of crucial [[nutrient]]s or [[micronutrient]]s, a lack or excess of which can cause a great many ailments.<ref name=\"Lawrie\" />{{rp|29}} In Australia, for instance, where the soil contains limited [[phosphate]], cattle are being fed additional phosphate to increase the efficiency of beef production.<ref name=\"Lawrie\" />{{rp|28}} Also in Australia, cattle and sheep in certain areas were often found losing their appetite and dying in the midst of rich pasture; this was at length found to be a result of [[cobalt]] deficiency in the soil.<ref name=\"Lawrie\" />{{rp|29}} Plant [[toxin]]s are also a risk to grazing animals; for instance, [[sodium fluoroacetate]], found in some African and Australian plants, kills by disrupting the [[cellular metabolism]].<ref name=\"Lawrie\" />{{rp|29}} Certain man-made [[pollutant]]s such as [[methylmercury]] and some [[pesticide]] residues present a particular hazard due to their tendency to [[Bioaccumulation|bioaccumulate]] in meat, potentially poisoning consumers.<ref name=\"Lawrie\" />{{rp|30}}\n\n=== Human intervention ===\nMeat producers may seek to improve the [[fertility]] of female animals through the administration of [[Gonadotropic cell|gonadotrophic]] or [[ovulation]]-inducing [[hormone]]s.<ref name=\"Lawrie\" />{{rp|31}} In pig production, [[Domestic pig|sow]] infertility is a common problem \u2014 possibly due to excessive fatness.<ref name=\"Lawrie\" />{{rp|32}} No methods currently exist to augment the fertility of male animals.<ref name=\"Lawrie\" />{{rp|32}} [[Artificial insemination]] is now routinely used to produce animals of the best possible genetic quality, and the efficiency of this method is improved through the administration of hormones that synchronize the ovulation cycles within groups of females.<ref name=\"Lawrie\" />{{rp|33}}\n\n[[Growth hormone]]s, particularly [[Anabolism|anabolic]] agents such as [[steroid]]s, are used in some countries to accelerate muscle growth in animals.<ref name=\"Lawrie\" />{{rp|33}} This practice has given rise to the [[beef hormone controversy]], an international trade dispute. It may also decrease the tenderness of meat, although research on this is inconclusive,<ref name=\"Lawrie\" />{{rp|35}} and have other effects on the composition of the muscle flesh.<ref name=\"Lawrie\" />{{rp|36ff}} Where [[castration]] is used to improve control over male animals, its side effects are also counteracted by the administration of hormones.<ref name=\"Lawrie\" />{{rp|33}}\n\n[[Sedative]]s may be administered to animals to counteract stress factors and increase weight gain.<ref name=\"Lawrie\" />{{rp|39}} The feeding of [[antibiotics]] to certain animals has been shown to improve growth rates also.<ref name=\"Lawrie\" />{{rp|39}} This practice is particularly prevalent in the USA, but has been banned in the [[European Union|EU]], partly because it causes [[antimicrobial resistance]] in [[pathogen]]ic microorganisms.<ref name=\"Lawrie\" />{{rp|39}}\n\n== Biochemical composition ==\nNumerous aspects of the biochemical composition of meat vary in complex ways depending on the species, breed, sex, age, plane of nutrition, training and exercise of the animal, as well as on the anatomical location of the musculature involved.<ref name=\"Lawrie\" />{{rp|94\u2013126}} Even between animals of the same litter and sex there are considerable differences in such parameters as the percentage of intramuscular fat.<ref name=\"Lawrie\" />{{rp|126}}\n\n=== Main constituents ===\nAdult mammalian [[muscle]] flesh consists of roughly 75 percent water, 19 percent protein, 2.5 percent intramuscular fat, 1.2 percent [[carbohydrate]]s and 2.3 percent other soluble non-protein substances. These include [[nitrogen]]ous compounds, such as [[amino acid]]s, and inorganic substances such as minerals.<ref name=\"Lawrie\" />{{rp|76}}\n\nMuscle proteins are either soluble in water ([[sarcoplasm]]ic proteins, about 11.5 percent of total muscle mass) or in concentrated salt solutions ([[myofibril]]lar proteins, about 5.5 percent of mass).<ref name=\"Lawrie\" />{{rp|75}} There are several hundred sarcoplasmic proteins.<ref name=\"Lawrie\" />{{rp|77}} Most of them \u2013 the glycolytic [[enzyme]]s \u2013 are involved in the [[Glycolysis|glycolytic pathway]], i.e., the conversion of stored energy into muscle power.<ref name=\"Lawrie\" />{{rp|78}} The two most abundant myofibrillar proteins, [[myosin]] and [[actin]],<ref name=\"Lawrie\" />{{rp|79}} are responsible for the muscle's overall structure. The remaining protein mass consists of [[connective tissue]] ([[collagen]] and [[elastin]]) as well as [[organelle]] tissue.<ref name=\"Lawrie\" />{{rp|79}}\n\nFat in meat can be either [[adipose tissue]], used by the animal to store energy and consisting of \"true fats\" ([[ester]]s of [[glycerol]] with [[fatty acid]]s),<ref name=\"Lawrie\" />{{rp|82}} or intramuscular fat, which contains considerable quantities of [[phospholipid]]s and of [[Saponification|unsaponifiable]] constituents such as [[cholesterol]].<ref name=\"Lawrie\" />{{rp|82}}\n\n=== Red and white ===\n[[File:Blade steak.jpg|thumb|Blade steaks are an example of \"red\" meat]]\nMeat can be broadly classified as \"red\" or \"white\" depending on the concentration of [[myoglobin]] in muscle fibre. When myoglobin is exposed to [[oxygen]], reddish oxymyoglobin develops, making myoglobin-rich meat appear red. The redness of meat depends on species, animal age, and fibre type: [[Red meat]] contains more narrow muscle fibres that tend to operate over long periods without rest,<ref name=\"Lawrie\" />{{rp|93}} while [[white meat]] contains more broad fibres that tend to work in short fast bursts.<ref name=\"Lawrie\" />{{rp|93}}\n\nGenerally, the meat of adult mammals such as [[beef|cows]], [[Lamb and mutton|sheep]], and [[horse meat|horses]] is considered red, while [[Chicken as food|chicken]] and [[Turkey meat|turkey]] breast meat is considered white.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.fitday.com/fitness-articles/nutrition/healthy-eating/white-meat-vs-red-meat.html|title=White Meat vs. Red Meat / Nutrition / Healthy Eating|access-date=April 25, 2017|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170505011359/http://www.fitday.com/fitness-articles/nutrition/healthy-eating/white-meat-vs-red-meat.html|archive-date=May 5, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== Nutritional information ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; margin-left:1em;\"\n|+'''Typical nutritional content of <br />110&nbsp;grams (4&nbsp;oz or .25&nbsp;lb) of meat'''\n|-\n! style=\"background:#aaf; text-align:center;\"| '''Source'''\n! style=\"background:#ddf; text-align:center;\"| '''[[Calorie]]s'''\n! style=\"background:#ddf; text-align:center;\"| '''[[Protein]]'''\n! style=\"background:#ddf; text-align:center;\"| '''[[Carbohydrate|Carbs]]'''\n! style=\"background:#ddf; text-align:center;\"| '''[[Fat]]'''\n|-\n! style=\"background:#ccf; text-align:left;\"| Fish\n| style=\"background:#fff; text-align:center;\"| 110\u2013140\n| style=\"background:#fff; text-align:center;\"| 20\u201325&nbsp;g\n| style=\"background:#fff; text-align:center;\"| 0&nbsp;g\n| style=\"background:#fff; text-align:center;\"| 1\u20135&nbsp;g\n|-\n! style=\"background:#ccf; text-align:left;\"| Chicken breast\n| style=\"background:#fff; text-align:center;\"| 160\n| style=\"background:#fff; text-align:center;\"| 28&nbsp;g\n| style=\"background:#fff; text-align:center;\"| 0&nbsp;g\n| style=\"background:#fff; text-align:center;\"| 7&nbsp;g\n|-\n! style=\"background:#ccf; text-align:left;\"| Lamb\n| style=\"background:#fff; text-align:center;\"| 250\n| style=\"background:#fff; text-align:center;\"| 30&nbsp;g\n| style=\"background:#fff; text-align:center;\"| 0&nbsp;g\n| style=\"background:#fff; text-align:center;\"| 14&nbsp;g\n|-\n! style=\"background:#ccf; text-align:left;\"| Steak (beef top round)\n| style=\"background:#fff; text-align:center;\"| 210\n| style=\"background:#fff; text-align:center;\"| 36&nbsp;g\n| style=\"background:#fff; text-align:center;\"| 0&nbsp;g\n| style=\"background:#fff; text-align:center;\"| 7&nbsp;g\n|-\n! style=\"background:#ccf; text-align:left;\"| Steak (beef T-bone)\n| style=\"background:#fff; text-align:center;\"| 450\n| style=\"background:#fff; text-align:center;\"| 25&nbsp;g\n| style=\"background:#fff; text-align:center;\"| 0&nbsp;g\n| style=\"background:#fff; text-align:center;\"| 35&nbsp;g\n|-\n! style=\"background:#ccf; text-align:left;\"| Dog (various cuts)<ref>Ann Yong-Geun [http://wolf.ok.ac.kr/~annyg/report/r2.htm \"Dog Meat Foods in Korea\"] {{Webarchive|url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20071007160723/http://wolf.ok.ac.kr/~annyg/report/r2.htm|date=2007-10-07}}, Table 4.

Wild animals such as [[deer]] are typically leaner than farm animals, leading those concerned about fat content to choose [[game (food)|game]] such as [[venison]]. Decades of breeding meat animals for fatness is being reversed by consumer demand for meat with less fat. The fatty deposits that exist with the muscle fibers in meats soften meat when it is cooked and improve the flavor through chemical changes initiated through heat that allow the protein and fat molecules to interact. The fat, when cooked with meat, also makes the meat seem juicier. The nutritional contribution of the fat is mainly calories as opposed to protein. As fat content rises, the meat's contribution to nutrition declines. In addition, there is [[cholesterol]] associated with fat surrounding the meat. The cholesterol is a lipid associated with the kind of saturated fat found in meat. The increase in meat consumption after 1960 is associated with, though not definitively the cause of, significant imbalances of fat and cholesterol in the human diet.<ref>Horowitz, Roger. \"Putting Meat on the American Table: Taste, Technology, Transformation\" The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2005 p. 4.</ref>\n\nThe table in this section compares the nutritional content of several types of meat. While each kind of meat has about the same content of protein and carbohydrates, there is a very wide range of fat content.\n\n\n== Production ==\n{{Main|Meat industry|Meat packing industry|Animal slaughter|Slaughterhouse|Butchery}}\n{{See also|Fishing industry}}\nMeat is produced by killing an animal and cutting flesh out of it. These procedures are called [[Animal slaughter|slaughter]] and [[butchery]], respectively. There is ongoing research into producing [[In vitro meat|meat ''in vitro'']]; that is, outside of animals.\n\nNote:  The following sections deal primarily with the commercialized process of domestic meat production. Certain points would not apply if one is hunting for meat or raising animals on a homestead. \n\n=== Transport ===\nUpon reaching a predetermined age or weight, livestock are usually transported ''en masse'' to the slaughterhouse. Depending on its length and circumstances, this may exert stress and injuries on the animals, and some may die ''en route''.<ref name=\"Lawrie\" />{{rp|129}} Unnecessary stress in transport may adversely affect the quality of the meat.<ref name=\"Lawrie\" />{{rp|129}} In particular, the muscles of stressed animals are low in water and [[glycogen]], and their [[pH]] fails to attain acidic values, all of which results in poor meat quality.<ref name=\"Lawrie\" />{{rp|130}} Consequently, and also due to campaigning by [[animal welfare]] groups, laws and industry practices in several countries tend to become more restrictive with respect to the duration and other circumstances of livestock transports.\n\n=== Slaughter ===\n{{see also|Animal slaughter|Labor rights in American meatpacking industry|Meat industry}}\nAnimals are usually slaughtered by being first [[stunned]] and then [[exsanguination|exsanguinated]] (bled out). Death results from the one or the other procedure, depending on the methods employed. Stunning can be effected through [[asphyxia]]ting the animals with [[carbon dioxide]], shooting them with a [[gun]] or a [[captive bolt pistol]], or shocking them with electric current.<ref name=\"Lawrie\" />{{rp|134ff}} In most forms of [[ritual slaughter]], stunning is not allowed.\n\nDraining as much blood as possible from the carcass is necessary because blood causes the meat to have an unappealing appearance and is a breeding ground for microorganisms.<ref name=\"Lawrie\" />{{rp|1340}} The exsanguination is accomplished by severing the [[carotid artery]] and the [[jugular vein]] in cattle and sheep, and the [[anterior vena cava]] in pigs.<ref name=\"Lawrie\" />{{rp|137}}\n \t\nThe act of slaughtering animals for meat, or of raising or transporting animals for slaughter, may

Spoilage is caused by the practically unavoidable infection and subsequent [[decomposition]] of meat by [[bacteria]] and [[Fungus|fungi]], which are borne by the animal itself, by the people handling the meat, and by their implements. Meat can be kept edible for a much longer time \u2013 though not indefinitely \u2013 if proper [[hygiene]] is observed during production and processing, and if appropriate [[food safety]], [[food preservation]] and [[food storage]] procedures are applied. Without the application of [[preservative]]s and stabilizers, the fats in meat may also begin to rapidly decompose after cooking or processing, leading to an objectionable taste known as [[warmed over flavor]].\n\n== Methods of preparation{{anchor|Processed meat}} ==\n[[File:Hanging Meat at a Street Fair 2.JPG|thumb|A spit [[barbecue]] at a street fair in New York City's [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]].]]\n[[File:Porksmoke1.jpg|thumb|Pork ribs being smoked]]\nFresh meat can be cooked for immediate consumption, or be processed, that is, treated for longer-term [[Food preservation|preservation]] and later consumption, possibly after further preparation. Fresh meat cuts or processed cuts may produce iridescence, commonly thought to be due to spoilage but actually caused by structural coloration and [[diffraction]] of the light.<ref name=foods>{{cite journal | date=November 2013 | author=Martinez-Hurtado, J L | title=Iridescence in Meat Caused by Surface Gratings | journal=Foods | volume=2 | pages=499\u2013506 |doi=10.3390/foods2040499 | issue=4| hdl=10149/597186 | pmc=5302279 | pmid=28239133}}</ref> A common additive to processed meats for both preservation and the prevention of discoloration is [[sodium nitrite]].

It may be ground then formed into patties (as [[hamburger]]s or croquettes), loaves, or [[sausage]]s, or used in loose form (as in \"sloppy joe\" or [[Bolognese sauce]]).\n\nSome meat is cured by [[smoking (food)|smoking]], which is the process of [[seasoning|flavoring]], [[cooking]], or [[food preservation|preserving]] [[food]] by exposing it to the [[smoke]] from burning or smoldering plant materials, most often [[wood]].

Other kinds of meat are [[marinade|marinated]] and [[barbecue]]d, or simply boiled, [[roasting|roasted]], or [[frying|fried]].\n\nMeat is generally eaten cooked, but many recipes call for raw beef, veal or fish ([[tartare]]).

The advent of civilization allowed the [[domestication of animals]] such as chickens, sheep, rabbits, pigs and cattle. This eventually led to their use in meat production on an industrial scale with the aid of [[slaughterhouse]]s.\n\nMeat is mainly composed of water, [[protein]], and [[fat]]. It is edible raw, but is normally eaten after it has been cooked and seasoned or processed in a variety of ways. Unprocessed meat will [[Meat spoilage|spoil or rot]] within hours or days as a result of infection with and decomposition by [[bacteria]] and [[Fungus|fungi]].\n\nMeat is important in economy and culture, even though its mass production and consumption has been determined to pose risks for human health and the environment. Many religions have rules about which meat may or may not be eaten.

The term is related to ''mad'' in [[Danish language|Danish]], ''mat'' in [[Swedish language|Swedish]] and [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], and ''matur'' in [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] and [[Faroese language|Faroese]], which also mean 'food'. The word ''mete'' also exists in [[Old Frisian]] (and to a lesser extent, modern [[West Frisian language|West Frisian]]) to denote important food, differentiating it from ''swiets'' (sweets) and ''dierfied'' (animal feed).\n\nMost often, ''meat'' refers to [[skeletal muscle]] and associated [[fat]] and other tissues, but it may also describe other edible tissues such as [[offal]].<ref name=\"Lawrie\" />{{rp|1}} ''Meat'' is sometimes also used in a more restrictive sense to mean the flesh of [[mammal]]ian species (pigs, cattle, lambs, etc.) raised and prepared for human consumption, to the exclusion of [[Fish as food|fish]], other [[seafood]], [[entomophagy|insects]], [[poultry]], or other animals.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/meat|title=Meat definition and meaning {{!}} Collins English Dictionary|website=www.collinsdictionary.com|language=en|access-date=June 16, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170712041548/https://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/meat|archive-date=July 12, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref><ref name=\"Definition of MEAT\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/meat|title=Definition of MEAT|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|access-date=June 16, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180319025828/https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/meat|archive-date=March 19, 2018|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nIn the context of food, ''meat'' can also refer to \"the edible part of something as distinguished from its covering (such as a husk or shell)\", for example, ''coconut meat''.<ref name=\"Definition of MEAT\"/>\n\n== History ==\n===Hunting and farming===\n{{See also|History of agriculture}}\n[[Paleontology|Paleontological]] evidence suggests that meat constituted a substantial proportion of the diet of the earliest humans.<ref name=\"Lawrie\" />{{rp|2}} Early [[hunter-gatherer]]s depended on the organized hunting of large animals such as [[bison]] and [[deer]].<ref name=\"Lawrie\" />{{rp|2}}\n\nThe [[domestication]] of animals, of which we have evidence dating back to the end of the [[last glacial period]] (c. 10,000 BCE),<ref name=\"Lawrie\" />{{rp|2}} allowed the systematic production of meat and the [[animal husbandry|breeding]] of animals with a view to improving meat production.<ref name=\"Lawrie\" />{{rp|2}} Animals that are now principal sources of meat were domesticated in conjunction with the development of early civilizations:\n[[File:Lamb meat.jpg|thumb|right|A typical shoulder cut of [[Lamb and mutton|lamb]]]]\n* [[Sheep]], originating from western Asia, were domesticated with the help of dogs prior to the establishment of settled [[agriculture]], likely as early as the 8th millennium BCE.<ref name=\"Lawrie\" />{{rp|3}} Several breeds of sheep were established in ancient [[Mesopotamia]] and [[ancient Egypt|Egypt]] by 3500\u20133000 BCE.<ref name=\"Lawrie\" />{{rp|3}} Today, more than 200 [[List of sheep breeds|sheep-breeds]] exist.\n* [[Cattle]] were domesticated in Mesopotamia after settled agriculture was established about 5000 BCE,<ref name=\"Lawrie\" />{{rp|5}} and several breeds were established by 2500 BCE.<ref name=\"Lawrie\" />{{rp|6}} Modern domesticated cattle fall into the groups ''[[Cattle|Bos taurus]]'' (European cattle) and ''[[Zebu|Bos taurus indicus]]'' (zebu), both descended from the now-extinct [[aurochs]].<ref name=\"Lawrie\" />{{rp|5}} The breeding of [[beef cattle]], cattle optimized for meat production as opposed to animals best suited for work or dairy purposes, began in the middle of the 18th century.<ref name=\"Lawrie\" />{{rp|7}}\n[[File:Hereford bull large.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Hereford (cattle)|Hereford]] bull, a breed of cattle frequently used in beef production.]]\n* [[Domestic pig]]s, which are descended from [[wild boar]]s, are known to have existed about 2500 BCE in modern-day Hungary and in [[Troy]]; earlier pottery from [[Tell es-Sultan]] (Jericho) and Egypt depicts wild pigs.<ref name=\"Lawrie\" />{{rp|8}} [[Pork]] sausages and [[ham]]s were of great commercial importance in [[Greco-Roman world|Greco-Roman]] times.<ref name=\"Lawrie\" />{{rp|8}} Pigs continue to be bred intensively as they are being optimized to produce meat best suited for specific meat products.<ref name=\"Lawrie\" />{{rp|9}}\n\n[[File:Dog meat at Gyeongdong Market.jpg|thumb|Dog meat sold at [[Gyeongdong Market]], Seoul, South Korea]]{{World laws on killing dogs for consumption}}\nOther animals are or have been raised or hunted for their flesh.

[[Plato]]'s ''[[Republic]]'' has [[Socrates]] describe the ideal state as vegetarian. [[Pythagoras]] believed that humans and animals were equal and therefore disapproved of meat consumption, as did [[Plutarch]], whereas [[Zeno of Elea|Zeno]] and [[Epicurus]] were [[vegetarian]] but allowed meat-eating in their philosophy.{{r|Buscemi|p=10}} Conversely, [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Politics (Aristotle)|Politics]]'' assert that animals, as inferior beings, exist to serve humans, including as food. [[Augustine]] drew on Aristotle to argue that the universe's natural hierarchy allows humans to eat animals, and animals to eat plants.{{r|Buscemi|p=10}} [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] philosophers were likewise divided. [[Descartes]] wrote that animals are merely animated machines, and [[Kant]] considered them inferior beings for lack of discernment; means rather than ends.{{r|Buscemi|p=11}} But [[Voltaire]] and [[Rousseau]] disagreed. The latter argued that meat-eating is a social rather than a natural act, because children are not interested in meat.{{r|Buscemi|p=11}}\n\nLater philosophers examined the changing practices of eating meat in the [[modern age]] as part of a process of detachment from animals as living beings. [[Norbert Elias]], for instance, noted that in medieval times cooked animals were brought to the table whole, but that since the [[Renaissance]] only the edible parts are served, which are no longer recognizably part of an animal.{{r|Buscemi|p=12}} Modern eaters, according to [[:fr:No\u00eblie Vialles|No\u00eblie Vialles]], demand an \"[[Ellipsis (linguistics)|ellipsis]]\" between meat and dead animals; for instance, calves' eyes are no longer considered a delicacy as in the Middle Ages, but provoke disgust.{{r|Buscemi|p=12}} Even in the English language, distinctions emerged between animals and their meat, such as between [[cattle]] and [[beef]], [[pig]]s and [[pork]].{{r|Buscemi|p=12}} [[Fernand Braudel]] wrote that since the European diet of the 15th and 16th century was particularly heavy in meat, European [[colonialism]] helped export meat-eating across the globe, as colonized peoples took up the culinary habits of their colonizers, which they associated with wealth and power.{{r|Buscemi|p=15}}\n\n== Consumption ==\n{{further|List of countries by meat consumption per capita|List of countries by meat consumption}}{{Bar chart|title=Number of Land Animals Killed for Meat in 2013<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/QL|title=FAOSTAT|website=www.fao.org|access-date=2019-10-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170511194947/http://www.fao.org/faostat/en/#data/QL|archive-date=May 11, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>|float=right|label_type=Animals|data_type=Number Killed|bar_width=20|width_units=em|data_max=61171973510|label1=Chickens|data1=61171973510|label2=Ducks|data2=2887594480|label3=Pigs|data3=1451856889|label4=Rabbits|data4=1171578000|label5=Geese|data5=687147000|label6=Turkeys|data6=618086890|label7=Sheep|data7=536742256|label8=Goats|data8=438320370|label9=Cattle|data9=298799160|label10=Rodents|data10=70371000|label11=Pigeons and other birds|data11=59656000|label12=Buffalo|data12=25798819|label13=Horses|data13=4863367|label14=Donkeys and mules|data14=3478300|label15=Camels and other camelids|data15=3298266}}Meat consumption varies worldwide, depending on cultural or religious preferences, as well as economic conditions.

Multiple asexual reproduction of animals bearing desirable traits is anticipated,<ref name=\"Lawrie\" />{{rp|22}} although this is not yet practical on a commercial scale.\n\n=== Environment ===\nHeat regulation in [[livestock]] is of great economic significance, because mammals attempt to maintain a constant optimal body temperature. Low temperatures tend to prolong animal development and high temperatures tend to retard it.<ref name=\"Lawrie\" />{{rp|22}} Depending on their size, body shape and insulation through tissue and fur, some animals have a relatively narrow zone of temperature tolerance and others (e.g. cattle) a broad one.<ref name=\"Lawrie\" />{{rp|23}} Static [[magnetic field]]s, for reasons still unknown, also retard animal development.<ref name=\"Lawrie\" />{{rp|23}}\n\n=== Nutrition ===\nThe quality and quantity of usable meat depends on the animal's ''plane of nutrition'', i.e., whether it is over- or underfed. Scientists disagree about how exactly the plane of nutrition influences carcass composition.<ref name=\"Lawrie\" />{{rp|25}}\n\nThe composition of the diet, especially the amount of protein provided, is also an important factor regulating animal growth.<ref name=\"Lawrie\" />{{rp|26}}  [[Ruminant]]s, which may digest [[cellulose]], are better adapted to poor-quality diets, but their ruminal microorganisms degrade high-quality protein if supplied in excess.<ref name=\"Lawrie\" />{{rp|27}} Because producing high-quality protein animal feed is expensive (see also ''[[Meat#Environmental impact|Environmental impact]]'' below), several techniques are employed or experimented with to ensure maximum utilization of protein. These include the treatment of feed with [[Formaldehyde|formalin]] to protect [[amino acid]]s during their passage through the [[rumen]], the recycling of [[manure]] by feeding it back to cattle mixed with feed concentrates, or the partial conversion of [[petroleum]] [[hydrocarbon]]s to protein through microbial action.<ref name=\"Lawrie\" />{{rp|30}}\n\nIn plant feed, environmental factors influence the availability of crucial [[nutrient]]s or [[micronutrient]]s, a lack or excess of which can cause a great many ailments.<ref name=\"Lawrie\" />{{rp|29}} In Australia, for instance, where the soil contains limited [[phosphate]], cattle are being fed additional phosphate to increase the efficiency of beef production.<ref name=\"Lawrie\" />{{rp|28}} Also in Australia, cattle and sheep in certain areas were often found losing their appetite and dying in the midst of rich pasture; this was at length found to be a result of [[cobalt]] deficiency in the soil.<ref name=\"Lawrie\" />{{rp|29}} Plant [[toxin]]s are also a risk to grazing animals; for instance, [[sodium fluoroacetate]], found in some African and Australian plants, kills by disrupting the [[cellular metabolism]].<ref name=\"Lawrie\" />{{rp|29}} Certain man-made [[pollutant]]s such as [[methylmercury]] and some [[pesticide]] residues present a particular hazard due to their tendency to [[Bioaccumulation|bioaccumulate]] in meat, potentially poisoning consumers.<ref name=\"Lawrie\" />{{rp|30}}\n\n=== Human intervention ===\nMeat producers may seek to improve the [[fertility]] of female animals through the administration of [[Gonadotropic cell|gonadotrophic]] or [[ovulation]]-inducing [[hormone]]s.<ref name=\"Lawrie\" />{{rp|31}} In pig production, [[Domestic pig|sow]] infertility is a common problem \u2014 possibly due to excessive fatness.<ref name=\"Lawrie\" />{{rp|32}} No methods currently exist to augment the fertility of male animals.<ref name=\"Lawrie\" />{{rp|32}} [[Artificial insemination]] is now routinely used to produce animals of the best possible genetic quality, and the efficiency of this method is improved through the administration of hormones that synchronize the ovulation cycles within groups of females.<ref name=\"Lawrie\" />{{rp|33}}\n\n[[Growth hormone]]s, particularly [[Anabolism|anabolic]] agents such as [[steroid]]s, are used in some countries to accelerate muscle growth in animals.<ref name=\"Lawrie\" />{{rp|33}} This practice has given rise to the [[beef hormone controversy]], an international trade dispute. It may also decrease the tenderness of meat, although research on this is inconclusive,<ref name=\"Lawrie\" />{{rp|35}} and have other effects on the composition of the muscle flesh.<ref name=\"Lawrie\" />{{rp|36ff}} Where [[castration]] is used to improve control over male animals, its side effects are also counteracted by the administration of hormones.<ref name=\"Lawrie\" />{{rp|33}}\n\n[[Sedative]]s may be administered to animals to counteract stress factors and increase weight gain.<ref name=\"Lawrie\" />{{rp|39}} The feeding of [[antibiotics]] to certain animals has been shown to improve growth rates also.<ref name=\"Lawrie\" />{{rp|39}} This practice is particularly prevalent in the USA, but has been banned in the [[European Union|EU]], partly because it causes [[antimicrobial resistance]] in [[pathogen]]ic microorganisms.<ref name=\"Lawrie\" />{{rp|39}}\n\n== Biochemical composition ==\nNumerous aspects of the biochemical composition of meat vary in complex ways depending on the species, breed, sex, age, plane of nutrition, training and exercise of the animal, as well as on the anatomical location of the musculature involved.<ref name=\"Lawrie\" />{{rp|94\u2013126}} Even between animals of the same litter and sex there are considerable differences in such parameters as the percentage of intramuscular fat.<ref name=\"Lawrie\" />{{rp|126}}\n\n=== Main constituents ===\nAdult mammalian [[muscle]] flesh consists of roughly 75 percent water, 19 percent protein, 2.5 percent intramuscular fat, 1.2 percent [[carbohydrate]]s and 2.3 percent other soluble non-protein substances. These include [[nitrogen]]ous compounds, such as [[amino acid]]s, and inorganic substances such as minerals.<ref name=\"Lawrie\" />{{rp|76}}\n\nMuscle proteins are either soluble in water ([[sarcoplasm]]ic proteins, about 11.5 percent of total muscle mass) or in concentrated salt solutions ([[myofibril]]lar proteins, about 5.5 percent of mass).<ref name=\"Lawrie\" />{{rp|75}} There are several hundred sarcoplasmic proteins.<ref name=\"Lawrie\" />{{rp|77}} Most of them \u2013 the glycolytic [[enzyme]]s \u2013 are involved in the [[Glycolysis|glycolytic pathway]], i.e., the conversion of stored energy into muscle power.<ref name=\"Lawrie\" />{{rp|78}} The two most abundant myofibrillar proteins, [[myosin]] and [[actin]],<ref name=\"Lawrie\" />{{rp|79}} are responsible for the muscle's overall structure. The remaining protein mass consists of [[connective tissue]] ([[collagen]] and [[elastin]]) as well as [[organelle]] tissue.<ref name=\"Lawrie\" />{{rp|79}}\n\nFat in meat can be either [[adipose tissue]], used by the animal to store energy and consisting of \"true fats\" ([[ester]]s of [[glycerol]] with [[fatty acid]]s),<ref name=\"Lawrie\" />{{rp|82}} or intramuscular fat, which contains considerable quantities of [[phospholipid]]s and of [[Saponification|unsaponifiable]] constituents such as [[cholesterol]].<ref name=\"Lawrie\" />{{rp|82}}\n\n=== Red and white ===\n[[File:Blade steak.jpg|thumb|Blade steaks are an example of \"red\" meat]]\nMeat can be broadly classified as \"red\" or \"white\" depending on the concentration of [[myoglobin]] in muscle fibre. When myoglobin is exposed to [[oxygen]], reddish oxymyoglobin develops, making myoglobin-rich meat appear red. The redness of meat depends on species, animal age, and fibre type: [[Red meat]] contains more narrow muscle fibres that tend to operate over long periods without rest,<ref name=\"Lawrie\" />{{rp|93}} while [[white meat]] contains more broad fibres that tend to work in short fast bursts.<ref name=\"Lawrie\" />{{rp|93}}\n\nGenerally, the meat of adult mammals such as [[beef|cows]], [[Lamb and mutton|sheep]], and [[horse meat|horses]] is considered red, while [[Chicken as food|chicken]] and [[Turkey meat|turkey]] breast meat is considered white.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.fitday.com/fitness-articles/nutrition/healthy-eating/white-meat-vs-red-meat.html|title=White Meat vs. Red Meat / Nutrition / Healthy Eating|access-date=April 25, 2017|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170505011359/http://www.fitday.com/fitness-articles/nutrition/healthy-eating/white-meat-vs-red-meat.html|archive-date=May 5, 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== Nutritional information ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"float:right; margin-left:1em;\"\n|+'''Typical nutritional content of <br />110&nbsp;grams (4&nbsp;oz or .25&nbsp;lb) of meat'''\n|-\n! style=\"background:#aaf; text-align:center;\"| '''Source'''\n! style=\"background:#ddf; text-align:center;\"| '''[[Calorie]]s'''\n! style=\"background:#ddf; text-align:center;\"| '''[[Protein]]'''\n! style=\"background:#ddf; text-align:center;\"| '''[[Carbohydrate|Carbs]]'''\n! style=\"background:#ddf; text-align:center;\"| '''[[Fat]]'''\n|-\n! style=\"background:#ccf; text-align:left;\"| Fish\n| style=\"background:#fff; text-align:center;\"| 110\u2013140\n| style=\"background:#fff; text-align:center;\"| 20\u201325&nbsp;g\n| style=\"background:#fff; text-align:center;\"| 0&nbsp;g\n| style=\"background:#fff; text-align:center;\"| 1\u20135&nbsp;g\n|-\n! style=\"background:#ccf; text-align:left;\"| Chicken breast\n| style=\"background:#fff; text-align:center;\"| 160\n| style=\"background:#fff; text-align:center;\"| 28&nbsp;g\n| style=\"background:#fff; text-align:center;\"| 0&nbsp;g\n| style=\"background:#fff; text-align:center;\"| 7&nbsp;g\n|-\n! style=\"background:#ccf; text-align:left;\"| Lamb\n| style=\"background:#fff; text-align:center;\"| 250\n| style=\"background:#fff; text-align:center;\"| 30&nbsp;g\n| style=\"background:#fff; text-align:center;\"| 0&nbsp;g\n| style=\"background:#fff; text-align:center;\"| 14&nbsp;g\n|-\n! style=\"background:#ccf; text-align:left;\"| Steak (beef top round)\n| style=\"background:#fff; text-align:center;\"| 210\n| style=\"background:#fff; text-align:center;\"| 36&nbsp;g\n| style=\"background:#fff; text-align:center;\"| 0&nbsp;g\n| style=\"background:#fff; text-align:center;\"| 7&nbsp;g\n|-\n! style=\"background:#ccf; text-align:left;\"| Steak (beef T-bone)\n| style=\"background:#fff; text-align:center;\"| 450\n| style=\"background:#fff; text-align:center;\"| 25&nbsp;g\n| style=\"background:#fff; text-align:center;\"| 0&nbsp;g\n| style=\"background:#fff; text-align:center;\"| 35&nbsp;g\n|-\n! style=\"background:#ccf; text-align:left;\"| Dog (various cuts)<ref>Ann Yong-Geun [http://wolf.ok.ac.kr/~annyg/report/r2.htm \"Dog Meat Foods in Korea\"] {{Webarchive|url=http://archive.wikiwix.com/cache/20071007160723/http://wolf.ok.ac.kr/~annyg/report/r2.htm|date=2007-10-07}}, Table 4.

Wild animals such as [[deer]] are typically leaner than farm animals, leading those concerned about fat content to choose [[game (food)|game]] such as [[venison]]. Decades of breeding meat animals for fatness is being reversed by consumer demand for meat with less fat. The fatty deposits that exist with the muscle fibers in meats soften meat when it is cooked and improve the flavor through chemical changes initiated through heat that allow the protein and fat molecules to interact. The fat, when cooked with meat, also makes the meat seem juicier. The nutritional contribution of the fat is mainly calories as opposed to protein. As fat content rises, the meat's contribution to nutrition declines. In addition, there is [[cholesterol]] associated with fat surrounding the meat. The cholesterol is a lipid associated with the kind of saturated fat found in meat. The increase in meat consumption after 1960 is associated with, though not definitively the cause of, significant imbalances of fat and cholesterol in the human diet.<ref>Horowitz, Roger. \"Putting Meat on the American Table: Taste, Technology, Transformation\" The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2005 p. 4.</ref>\n\nThe table in this section compares the nutritional content of several types of meat. While each kind of meat has about the same content of protein and carbohydrates, there is a very wide range of fat content.\n\n\n== Production ==\n{{Main|Meat industry|Meat packing industry|Animal slaughter|Slaughterhouse|Butchery}}\n{{See also|Fishing industry}}\nMeat is produced by killing an animal and cutting flesh out of it. These procedures are called [[Animal slaughter|slaughter]] and [[butchery]], respectively. There is ongoing research into producing [[In vitro meat|meat ''in vitro'']]; that is, outside of animals.\n\n=== Transport ===\nUpon reaching a predetermined age or weight, livestock are usually transported ''en masse'' to the slaughterhouse. Depending on its length and circumstances, this may exert stress and injuries on the animals, and some may die ''en route''.<ref name=\"Lawrie\" />{{rp|129}} Unnecessary stress in transport may adversely affect the quality of the meat.<ref name=\"Lawrie\" />{{rp|129}} In particular, the muscles of stressed animals are low in water and [[glycogen]], and their [[pH]] fails to attain acidic values, all of which results in poor meat quality.<ref name=\"Lawrie\" />{{rp|130}} Consequently, and also due to campaigning by [[animal welfare]] groups, laws and industry practices in several countries tend to become more restrictive with respect to the duration and other circumstances of livestock transports.\n\n=== Slaughter ===\n{{see also|Animal slaughter|Labor rights in American meatpacking industry|Meat industry}}\nAnimals are usually slaughtered by being first [[stunned]] and then [[exsanguination|exsanguinated]] (bled out). Death results from the one or the other procedure, depending on the methods employed. Stunning can be effected through [[asphyxia]]ting the animals with [[carbon dioxide]], shooting them with a [[gun]] or a [[captive bolt pistol]], or shocking them with electric current.<ref name=\"Lawrie\" />{{rp|134ff}} In most forms of [[ritual slaughter]], stunning is not allowed.\n\nDraining as much blood as possible from the carcass is necessary because blood causes the meat to have an unappealing appearance and is a breeding ground for microorganisms.<ref name=\"Lawrie\" />{{rp|1340}} The exsanguination is accomplished by severing the [[carotid artery]] and the [[jugular vein]] in cattle and sheep, and the [[anterior vena cava]] in pigs.<ref name=\"Lawrie\" />{{rp|137}}\n \t\nThe act of slaughtering animals for meat, or of raising or transporting animals for slaughter, may

Spoilage is caused by the practically unavoidable infection and subsequent [[decomposition]] of meat by [[bacteria]] and [[Fungus|fungi]], which are borne by the animal itself, by the people handling the meat, and by their implements. Meat can be kept edible for a much longer time \u2013 though not indefinitely \u2013 if proper [[hygiene]] is observed during production and processing, and if appropriate [[food safety]], [[food preservation]] and [[food storage]] procedures are applied. Without the application of [[preservative]]s and stabilizers, the fats in meat may also begin to rapidly decompose after cooking or processing, leading to an objectionable taste known as [[warmed over flavor]].\n\n== Methods of preparation{{anchor|Processed meat}} ==\n[[File:Hanging Meat at a Street Fair 2.JPG|thumb|A spit [[barbecue]] at a street fair in New York City's [[East Village, Manhattan|East Village]].]]\n[[File:Porksmoke1.jpg|thumb|Pork ribs being smoked]]\nFresh meat can be cooked for immediate consumption, or be processed, that is, treated for longer-term [[Food preservation|preservation]] and later consumption, possibly after further preparation. Fresh meat cuts or processed cuts may produce iridescence, commonly thought to be due to spoilage but actually caused by structural coloration and [[diffraction]] of the light.<ref name=foods>{{cite journal | date=November 2013 | author=Martinez-Hurtado, J L | title=Iridescence in Meat Caused by Surface Gratings | journal=Foods | volume=2 | pages=499\u2013506 |doi=10.3390/foods2040499 | issue=4| hdl=10149/597186 | pmc=5302279 | pmid=28239133}}</ref> A common additive to processed meats for both preservation and the prevention of discoloration is [[sodium nitrite]].

It may be ground then formed into patties (as [[hamburger]]s or croquettes), loaves, or [[sausage]]s, or used in loose form (as in \"sloppy joe\" or [[Bolognese sauce]]).\n\nSome meat is cured by [[smoking (food)|smoking]], which is the process of [[seasoning|flavoring]], [[cooking]], or [[food preservation|preserving]] [[food]] by exposing it to the [[smoke]] from burning or smoldering plant materials, most often [[wood]].

Other kinds of meat are [[marinade|marinated]] and [[barbecue]]d, or simply boiled, [[roasting|roasted]], or [[frying|fried]].\n\nMeat is generally eaten cooked, but many recipes call for raw beef, veal or fish ([[tartare]]).

Each band member tried out for the vocalist spot but it was thought that no one could sing well enough. In 1981 Dark Spot entered the battle of the band competition in Fremantle with an original song penned by Duncan Andrews with Andrews on vocals and bass.

Rogers Media also owns 52 radio stations and several television properties, including [[terrestrial television]] stations and [[cable television]] channels.\n\n==History==\nRogers Media was created in 1994 after the acquisition of [[Maclean-Hunter]] properties to manage all television station and specialty channels, radio stations and publishing assets. The division is split into two areas:\n\n*Broadcasting (television and radio)\n*Publishing (magazines and directories)\n\nRogers Media holds Rogers Communications' radio and television broadcasting operations, as well as the consumer and trade publishing operations, other television properties and notably the [[Toronto Blue Jays]] and [[Rogers Centre]]. Rogers Media also produces content and conducts e-commerce over the Internet relating to many of its individual broadcasting and publishing properties.\n\nThe group has 52 radio stations across Canada (as of 2015), 44 FM and 8 AM radio stations, thus making Rogers Media the third-largest radio broadcaster behind [[Bell Media]] and [[Newcap Radio]], the latter absorbed into the [[Stingray Group]]); both the [[Citytv]] and [[Omni Television]] networks consisting of 10 television stations. The division also operates specialty channels, including [[Sportsnet]], [[OLN]] and [[G4 (Canada)|G4]], and also owns an interest in the [[pay-per-view]] service [[Viewers Choice]]. Through Sportsnet, Rogers Media also holds 50% ownership in Dome Productions, a mobile production and distribution joint venture that is a leader in high-definition television (HDTV) production and broadcasting in Canada.\n\nRogers Media's publishing group publishes several consumer magazines and trade and professional publications and directories in Canada.\n\n==Operations==\n{{main|List of assets owned by Rogers Communications}}\n\n===Broadcasting===\nRogers Broadcasting Limited operates 52 Canadian radio stations, (44 FM and 8 AM radio stations) including formerly three (now two) FM stations launched in the Maritimes in October 2005; [[Omni Television]], which operates five multicultural television stations (two in Ontario, two in Alberta, and one in British Columbia); [[Citytv]]; which operates 7 stations in Toronto, Winnipeg, Calgary, Edmonton, Vancouver, Montreal and Saskatchewan (cable-only) with 3 privately owned affiliates in Prince George, Kamloops, and Medicine Hat; [[Sportsnet]], a specialty sports television service licensed to provide regional sports programming across Canada; [[The Shopping Channel]], Canada's only nationally televised shopping service, [[The Biography Channel (Canada)|The Biography Channel Canada]], acquired outright in August 2006 when Rogers bought out the 40% stake owned by Calgary's Shaw Communications and A&E Television Networks' 20% ownership.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.shoprogers.com/investorrelations/rogers_media.asp?shopperID=QPPF8GKRFXM98K9D6F1MFKBU47SNBAP9 |title=Investor Relations |access-date=20 August 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928035807/http://www.shoprogers.com/investorrelations/rogers_media.asp?shopperID=QPPF8GKRFXM98K9D6F1MFKBU47SNBAP9 |archive-date=28 September 2007 |work=Rogers Communications Inc.}}</ref> and a majority and managing interest in [[G4 Canada]], a technology themed digital channel.  Rogers has returned to Canada's third-largest radio broadcaster behind [[Bell Media]] and [[Newcap Radio]].\n\nRogers also was a partner in [[DTour]] and [[Viewers Choice]]. Rogers also is a non-managing partner in [[OLN]], although on November 16, 2007, it was announced that Rogers would be acquiring 100% interest in the service from the remaining interest holders, CTVglobemedia and Comcast.\n\nSome of the better-known [[Rogers Radio|Rogers radio stations]] are CHFI Toronto ([[Canada]]'s most-listened to radio station), Kiss 92.5, CJCL Toronto (The FAN 590), CFTR Toronto (680 News), and various stations operating under the Jack FM brand. In summer 2006, Rogers acquired five stations from OK Radio in Alberta and, with regulatory approval, will be operating in Edmonton, Fort McMurray and Grande Prairie. Existing clusters of stations are in Vancouver-Victoria-Whistler, Calgary-Lethbridge, Winnipeg, Toronto, Ottawa, Kitchener and Halifax-Moncton-Saint John, NB.\n\nIn 2007, Rogers entered a tentative deal to purchase the [[CTV Two|A Channel]] stations, [[CKX-TV]], [[Access Alberta]], [[Canadian Learning Television]] and [[SexTV: The Channel]] from [[CHUM Limited]], as part of the latter company's pending takeover by [[CTVglobemedia]].  On June 8, 2007, the CRTC approved the [[CTVglobemedia|CTV]] transaction of CHUM, but it added a condition that CTV must divest itself of Citytv rather than A-Channel, effectively voiding the deal. On June 12, it was announced that Rogers had made a new offer of $375 million for the Citytv stations. On June 28, Rogers further offered to sell the two religious-licensed Omni stations in Winnipeg and Vancouver as part of the Citytv deal, although the company stated that it intended to retain the multilingual-licensed Omni stations. That same year, Rogers also applied to the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]] (CRTC) to acquire a 20 per cent interest in [[CP24]], a local news channel in Toronto which shares the same staff and resources from [[CITY-DT|Citytv Toronto]]. Both stations were previously owned by CHUM Limited, but CTVglobemedia retained ownership of CP24 following the CRTC's approval of the CHUM purchase.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/2007/n2007-12.htm#18 |title=ARCHIVED - Broadcasting Notice of Public Hearing CRTC 2007-12 |publisher=[[Government of Canada]] |work=[[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]] |date=31 August 2007 |access-date=6 April 2018}}</ref> In early December, CTV withdrew the application and announced that Rogers Media and CTVgm had come to a deal in which Rogers waived their 20 per cent stake.
