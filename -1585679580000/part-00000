The bomb was fastened on the dog and detonated upon contact with the target, killing the animal. Whereas in the first program, the dog was trained to locate a specific target, this task was simplified to find any enemy tank. Dogs were trained by being kept hungry and their food was placed under tanks. The tanks were at first left standing still, then they had their engines running, which was further combined with sporadic blank-shot gunfire and other battle-related distractions. This routine aimed to teach the dogs to run under the tanks in battlefield situations.<ref name=rus2/>\n\nEach dog was fitted with a {{convert|10|\u2013|12|kg|lb|adj=on}} mine carried in two canvas pouches adjusted individually to each dog. The mine had a safety pin which was removed right before the deployment; each mine carried no markings and was not supposed to be disarmed. A wooden lever extended out of a pouch to about {{convert|20|cm|in}} in height. When the dog dived under the tank, the lever struck the bottom of the tank and detonated the charge. Because the underparts of the [[chassis]] were the most vulnerable area of these vehicles, it was hoped the explosion would disable the vehicle.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ordatamines.maic.jmu.edu/displaydata.aspx?OrDataId=5609 |title=General Specifications |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071021200611/http://ordatamines.maic.jmu.edu/displaydata.aspx?OrDataId=5609 |archivedate=21 October 2007 |df=dmy }}</ref><ref name=Zalgoa43/>\n\n==Deployment by the Soviet Union==\n[[File:F ww2 sov16.jpg|thumb|right|280px|Military parade on [[Red Square]], Moscow, 1 May 1938]]\nThe use of anti-tank dogs was escalated during 1941 and 1942, when every effort was made by the Red Army to stop the German advance at the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front of World War II]]. In that period, the dog training schools were mostly focused on producing anti-tank dogs. About 40,000 dogs were deployed for various tasks in the Red Army.<ref name=axis>{{cite web|url=http://community-2.webtv.net/Hahn-50thAP-K9/K9History21/ |title=Our Allies...The Soviet Union and Their Use Of War Dogs |accessdate=8 August 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120905041258/http://community-2.webtv.net/Hahn-50thAP-K9/K9History21 |archivedate=5 September 2012 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\nThe first group of anti-tank dogs arrived at the frontline at the end of the summer of 1941 and included 30 dogs and 40 trainers. Their deployment revealed some serious problems. In order to save fuel and ammunition, dogs had been trained on tanks which stood still and did not fire their guns. In the field, the dogs refused to dive under moving tanks. Some persistent dogs ran near the tanks, waiting for them to stop but were shot in the process. Gunfire from the tanks scared away many of the dogs. They would run back to the trenches and often detonated the charge upon jumping in, killing Soviet soldiers. To prevent that, the returning dogs had to be shot, often by their controllers and this made the trainers unwilling to work with new dogs. Some went so far as to say that the army did not stop with sacrificing people to the war and went on to slaughter dogs too; those who openly criticized the program were persecuted by \"special departments\" (military counterintelligence).<ref name=rus2/> Out of the first group of 30 dogs, only four managed to detonate their bombs near the German tanks, inflicting an unknown amount of damage. Six exploded upon returning to the Soviet trenches, killing and injuring soldiers.<ref name=rus2/> Three dogs were shot by German troops and taken away, despite furious attempts by the Soviets to prevent this, which provided examples of the detonation mechanism to the Germans. A captured German officer later reported that they learned of the anti-tank dog design from the killed animals, and considered the program desperate and inefficient. A German propaganda campaign sought to discredit the Red Army, saying that Soviet soldiers refuse to fight and send dogs instead.<ref name=rus2/>\n\nAnother serious training mistake was revealed later; the Soviets used their own [[diesel engine]] tanks to train the dogs rather than German tanks which had [[gasoline]] engines.<ref name=Zalgoa43/> As the dogs relied on their acute sense of smell, the dogs sought out familiar Soviet tanks instead of strange-smelling German tanks.<ref name=Bishop205/> This effectively meant that the Soviets had trained the dogs to sabotage their own army.\n\nThe efficiency of using anti-tank dogs in World War II remains uncertain. There are claims by the Soviet sources that around 300 German tanks were damaged by Soviet anti-tank dogs.<ref name=rus1/> This claim was considered propaganda by many Russian historians who believed it was meant to justify the dog training program.<ref name=rus2/> There are, however, documented claims of individual successes of the program, with the number of damaged tanks usually being within a dozen.<ref name=rus1/><ref name=axis/> For example, at the front of the 160th Infantry Division near [[Hlukhiv]], six dogs had damaged five German tanks; near the airport of [[Battle of Stalingrad|Stalingrad]], anti-tank dogs destroyed 13 tanks. At the [[Battle of Kursk]], 16 dogs disabled 12 German tanks which had broken through the Soviet lines of defence near Tamarovka, Bykovo.<ref name=Zalgoa43>{{cite book |last=Zaloga |first=Steve |title=The Red Army of the Great Patriotic War, 1941\u201345 |publisher=Osprey Publishing |date=1989|location=Oxford, United Kingdom |page=43|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P7YiBBfGqrAC&pg=PA43|isbn=978-0-85045-939-5}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|authors=\u0411\u0438\u0440\u044e\u043a\u043e\u0432 \u0413\u0440\u0438\u0433\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0439 \u0424\u0435\u0434\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447 (Biryukov G.

An armored vehicle's top-mounted machine gun proved ineffective due to the relatively small size of the attackers as the dogs were too low to the ground and because of the dogs' speed and the difficulty in spotting them. Consequently, every German soldier received orders to shoot any dog in combat areas.<ref name=Zalgoa43/><ref name=Bishop205>{{cite book |last=Bishop |first=Chris |title=The Encyclopedia of Weapons of World War II: The Comprehensive Guide to Over 1,500 Weapons Systems, Including Tanks, Small Arms, Warplanes, Artillery, Ships and Submarines |publisher=Sterling Publishing Company, Inc. |date=2002 |location=New York City |page=205|isbn=978-1-58663-762-0}}</ref>\n\nAfter 1942, the use of anti-tank dogs by the Red Army rapidly declined, and training schools were redirected to producing the more needed mine-seeking and delivery dogs.

The aim was for a dog to run into a bunker carrying a bomb, which would then be detonated by a timer. Dogs in this secret program were trained at [[Fort Belvoir]]. The dogs, called \"demolition wolves\", were taught to run to a bunker, enter it, and sit while waiting for a simulated explosion. Each dog carried a bomb strapped to its body in canvas pouches, as with the Russian method. The program was terminated on 17 December 1943 out of safety concerns. During the training, dogs often returned to the senders without entering the bunker or waiting there for supposed period of time which would have caused friendly casualties in a live fire situation. It was feared that in the actual battle, dogs would return much more often, scared by enemy fire. Attempts to continue the program in 1944 and 1945 failed.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V6U537SjE7oC&pg=PA91|pages=89\u201391|title=War Dogs: A History of Loyalty and Heroism|author=Michael G.

The bomb was fastened on the dog and detonated upon contact with the target, killing the animal. Whereas in the first program, the dog was trained to locate a specific target, this task was simplified to find any enemy tank. Dogs were trained by being kept hungry and their food was placed under tanks. The tanks were at first left standing still, then they had their engines running, which was further combined with sporadic blank-shot gunfire and other battle-related distractions. This routine aimed to teach the dogs to run under the tanks in battlefield situations.<ref name=rus2/>\n\nEach dog was fitted with a {{convert|10|\u2013|12|kg|lb|adj=on}} mine carried in two canvas pouches adjusted individually to each dog. The mine had a safety pin which was removed right before the deployment; each mine carried no markings and was not supposed to be disarmed. A wooden lever extended out of a pouch to about {{convert|20|cm|in}} in height. When the dog dived under the tank, the lever struck the bottom of the tank and detonated the charge. Because the underparts of the [[chassis]] were the most vulnerable area of these vehicles, it was hoped the explosion would disable the vehicle.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ordatamines.maic.jmu.edu/displaydata.aspx?OrDataId=5609 |title=General Specifications |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071021200611/http://ordatamines.maic.jmu.edu/displaydata.aspx?OrDataId=5609 |archivedate=21 October 2007 |df=dmy }}</ref><ref name=Zalgoa43/>\n\n==Deployment by the Soviet Union==\n[[File:F ww2 sov16.jpg|thumb|right|280px|Military parade on [[Red Square]], Moscow, 1 May 1938]]\nThe use of anti-tank dogs was escalated during 1941 and 1942, when every effort was made by the Red Army to stop the German advance at the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front of World War II]]. In that period, the dog training schools were mostly focused on producing anti-tank dogs. About 40,000 dogs were deployed for various tasks in the Red Army.<ref name=axis>{{cite web|url=http://community-2.webtv.net/Hahn-50thAP-K9/K9History21/ |title=Our Allies...The Soviet Union and Their Use Of War Dogs |accessdate=8 August 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120905041258/http://community-2.webtv.net/Hahn-50thAP-K9/K9History21 |archivedate=5 September 2012 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n\nThe first group of anti-tank dogs arrived at the frontline at the end of the summer of 1941 and included 30 dogs and 40 trainers. Their deployment revealed some serious problems. In order to save fuel and ammunition, dogs had been trained on tanks which stood still and did not fire their guns. In the field, the dogs refused to dive under moving tanks. Some persistent dogs ran near the tanks, waiting for them to stop but were shot in the process. Gunfire from the tanks scared away many of the dogs. They would run back to the trenches and often detonated the charge upon jumping in, killing Soviet soldiers. To prevent that, the returning dogs had to be shot, often by their controllers and this made the trainers unwilling to work with new dogs. Some went so far as to say that the army did not stop with sacrificing people to the war and went on to slaughter dogs too; those who openly criticized the program were persecuted by \"special departments\" (military counterintelligence).<ref name=rus2/> Out of the first group of 30 dogs, only four managed to detonate their bombs near the German tanks, inflicting an unknown amount of damage. Six exploded upon returning to the Soviet trenches, killing and injuring soldiers.<ref name=rus2/> Three dogs were shot by German troops and taken away, despite furious attempts by the Soviets to prevent this, which provided examples of the detonation mechanism to the Germans. A captured German officer later reported that they learned of the anti-tank dog design from the killed animals, and considered the program desperate and inefficient. A German propaganda campaign sought to discredit the Red Army, saying that Soviet soldiers refuse to fight and send dogs instead.<ref name=rus2/>\n\nAnother serious training mistake was revealed later; the Soviets used their own [[diesel engine]] tanks to train the dogs rather than German tanks which had [[gasoline]] engines.<ref name=Zalgoa43/> As the dogs relied on their acute sense of smell, the dogs sought out familiar Soviet tanks instead of strange-smelling German tanks.<ref name=Bishop205/> This effectively meant that the Soviets had trained the dogs to sabotage their own army.\n\nThe efficiency of using anti-tank dogs in World War II remains uncertain. There are claims by the Soviet sources that around 300 German tanks were damaged by Soviet anti-tank dogs.<ref name=rus1/> This claim was questioned by Russian historians as propaganda, trying to justify the dog training program.<ref name=rus2/> There are however documented claims of individual successes of the program, with the number of damaged tanks usually being within a dozen.<ref name=rus1/><ref name=axis/> For example, at the front of the 160th Infantry Division near [[Hlukhiv]], six dogs had damaged five German tanks; near the airport of [[Battle of Stalingrad|Stalingrad]], anti-tank dogs destroyed 13 tanks. At the [[Battle of Kursk]], 16 dogs disabled 12 German tanks which had broken through the Soviet lines of defence near Tamarovka, Bykovo.<ref name=Zalgoa43>{{cite book |last=Zaloga |first=Steve |title=The Red Army of the Great Patriotic War, 1941\u201345 |publisher=Osprey Publishing |date=1989|location=Oxford, United Kingdom |page=43|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P7YiBBfGqrAC&pg=PA43|isbn=978-0-85045-939-5}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|authors=\u0411\u0438\u0440\u044e\u043a\u043e\u0432 \u0413\u0440\u0438\u0433\u043e\u0440\u0438\u0439 \u0424\u0435\u0434\u043e\u0440\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447 (Biryukov G.

An armored vehicle's top-mounted machine gun proved ineffective due to the relatively small size of the attackers as the dogs were too low to the ground and because of the dogs' speed and the difficulty in spotting them. Consequently, every German soldier received orders to shoot any dog in combat areas.<ref name=Zalgoa43/><ref name=Bishop205>{{cite book |last=Bishop |first=Chris |title=The Encyclopedia of Weapons of World War II: The Comprehensive Guide to Over 1,500 Weapons Systems, Including Tanks, Small Arms, Warplanes, Artillery, Ships and Submarines |publisher=Sterling Publishing Company, Inc. |date=2002 |location=New York City |page=205|isbn=978-1-58663-762-0}}</ref>\n\nAfter 1942, the use of anti-tank dogs by the Red Army rapidly declined, and training schools were redirected to producing the more needed mine-seeking and delivery dogs.

The aim was for a dog to run into a bunker carrying a bomb, which would then be detonated by a timer. Dogs in this secret program were trained at [[Fort Belvoir]]. The dogs, called \"demolition wolves\", were taught to run to a bunker, enter it, and sit while waiting for a simulated explosion. Each dog carried a bomb strapped to its body in canvas pouches, as with the Russian method. The program was terminated on 17 December 1943 out of safety concerns. During the training, dogs often returned to the senders without entering the bunker or waiting there for supposed period of time which would have caused friendly casualties in a live fire situation. It was feared that in the actual battle, dogs would return much more often, scared by enemy fire. Attempts to continue the program in 1944 and 1945 failed.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V6U537SjE7oC&pg=PA91|pages=89\u201391|title=War Dogs: A History of Loyalty and Heroism|author=Michael G.

It was active from 1942 to 1976 under the Commander of the [[Fifth Naval District]], based in [[Norfolk, Virginia]].\n\nLocated on the appropriated campus of the [[Tome School]] for boys, the training center sat between various important naval centers of [[World War II]]: about {{convert|35|mi|km}} northeast of [[Baltimore, Maryland]], and {{convert|75|mi|km}} from Washington, D.C., and [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]]. It was reached via [[Maryland Route 222]], about halfway between [[U.S. Route 1 in Maryland|US&nbsp;1]] and [[U.S. Route 40 in Maryland|US&nbsp;40]]. \n\n==History==\n===Origin===\nPresident [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] personally approved the site, which was seized from the [[Tome School]] by Congressional order. Roosevelt also chose the name to honor Commodore [[William Bainbridge]], who commanded the [[frigate]] [[USS Constitution|''Constitution'']] when it defeated the British frigate [[HMS Java (1811)|HMS ''Java'']] during the [[War of 1812]]. \n\nThe campus was expanded by government purchase from {{convert|330|acre|km2}} to {{convert|1132|acre|km2}}. More than five hundred new buildings were built, some designed by [[Eggers & Higgins]].\n\n===World War II===\n====Recruit training====\nThe center was activated on 1 October 1942, and the first batch of recruits arrived 10 days later to begin \"boot camp\" training. They came in busloads from transportation collection points at [[Havre de Grace, Maryland|Havre de Grace]] and [[Perryville, Maryland]]. The recruits were given a battery of tests to determine their educational and skill levels, then trained in ordnance and gunnery, seamanship, fire fighting, physical training, and military drill.\n\nRecruits were trained in shipboard duties aboard the [[USS Commodore (401B)|R.T.S. ''Commodore'']], a 200-foot \"ship\" built on dry land. The trainer was equipped with  deck guns, a [[pilot house]], [[davit]]s with [[whaleboat]]s, and mooring lines fastened to earth-bound [[bollard]]s, so that crew members could learn casting off [[hawser]]s and other lines connecting the ship to its dock.\n\nHalfway through boot camp, recruits had a \"service week\", which generally included kitchen duty, peeling potatoes, mopping, picking up cigarette butts, etc. Recruits with desirable skills, such as typing, could end up on an office typewriter rather than in a kitchen. One winter, recruits were sent to shovel snow off roads to a largely rural area near Colora and Rising Sun.{{cn|date=February 2014}}<!---probably needs deletion. Sounds like trivia-->\n\nBy the end of World War II, the center had trained 244,277 recruits who transferred to various ships and stations throughout the world.\n\n====Non-recruit training====\nUSNTC Bainbridge also trained new boot camp graduates and other sailors in technical and other skills. During World War II, a total of 24,484 sailors completed various programs under the direction of the Service School Command<ref>[http://www.ibiblio.net/hyperwar/USN/ref/USN-Act/MD.html United States Naval Facilities World War II]</ref>.These included:\n[[File:Building Overtaken.jpg|alt=A panoramic image showing a large \"H-shaped\" building overtaken by nature due to Bainbridge's abandoning.|thumb|A panoramic image showing a large \"H-shaped\" building being overtaken by nature due to Bainbridge's abandoning. ]]\n[[File:Workshop Brick Making.jpg|alt=A brick-making workshop that has been left to rot.|thumb|A brick-making workshop that has been left to rot.]]\n\n* Coast Guard School\n* Rockefeller Research Unit (Report to Naval Training Station).\n* Stewards Mates' School Roll\n*[[Naval Academy Preparatory School]], founded in 1943.\n* Naval Hospital\n* Hospital Corps School\n* Naval Training School (Radio)\n* Naval Training School (Fire Controlmen)\n* Fire Fighters School\n* Naval Training School (Electrical)\n* Naval Training School (Physical Instructors)\n* Naval Training School (Instructors)\n* Naval Training School (Sound Motion Picture Technician)\n* Fire Fighters Training Unit\n* Naval Training School (Motion Picture Operators)\n* Naval Training School (Recruit Instructors \u2013 C)\n\n===First deactivation===\nAfter the war ended, the center continued limited operations until 30 June 1947, when it was first inactivated as a Navy training center. The sole remaining training activity on campus was the Naval Academy Prep School. A maintenance staff remained active to protect the buildings from weather and other damage. \n\n===Reactivation ===\nIn mid-1950, with the advent of the [[Korean War]] crisis, plans were made to reactivate the center, and it was officially reopened on 1 February 1951, when Captain Robert Hall Smith took overall command.\n\nDespite the care of the maintenance staff, the buildings were in severe disrepair. A contract was awarded to Consolidated Engineering Company of [[Baltimore, Maryland]]. The necessary renovations and road work were accomplished ahead of schedule, and the center reopened its gates for recruits on 5 April 1951.\n\nInitially, the center admitted 500 recruits per week, but the rate soon doubled.

It was active from 1942 to 1976 under the Commander of the [[Fifth Naval District]], based in [[Norfolk, Virginia]].\n\nLocated on the appropriated campus of the [[Tome School]] for boys, the training center sat between various important naval centers of [[World War II]]: about {{convert|35|mi|km}} northeast of [[Baltimore, Maryland]], and {{convert|75|mi|km}} from Washington, D.C., and [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]]. It was reached via [[Maryland Route 222]], about halfway between [[U.S. Route 1 in Maryland|US&nbsp;1]] and [[U.S. Route 40 in Maryland|US&nbsp;40]]. \n\n==History==\n===Origin===\nPresident [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]] personally approved the site, which was seized from the [[Tome School]] by Congressional order. Roosevelt also chose the name to honor Commodore [[William Bainbridge]], who commanded the [[frigate]] [[USS Constitution|''Constitution'']] when it defeated the British frigate [[HMS Java (1811)|HMS ''Java'']] during the [[War of 1812]]. \n\nThe campus was expanded by government purchase from {{convert|330|acre|km2}} to {{convert|1132|acre|km2}}. More than five hundred new buildings were built, some designed by [[Eggers & Higgins]].\n\n===World War II===\n====Recruit training====\nThe center was activated on 1 October 1942, and the first batch of recruits arrived 10 days later to begin \"boot camp\" training. They came in busloads from transportation collection points at [[Havre de Grace, Maryland|Havre de Grace]] and [[Perryville, Maryland]]. The recruits were given a battery of tests to determine their educational and skill levels, then trained in ordnance and gunnery, seamanship, fire fighting, physical training, and military drill.\n\nRecruits were trained in shipboard duties aboard the [[USS Commodore (401B)|R.T.S. ''Commodore'']], a 200-foot \"ship\" built on dry land. The trainer was equipped with  deck guns, a [[pilot house]], [[davit]]s with [[whaleboat]]s, and mooring lines fastened to earth-bound [[bollard]]s, so that crew members could learn casting off [[hawser]]s and other lines connecting the ship to its dock.\n\nHalfway through boot camp, recruits had a \"service week\", which generally included kitchen duty, peeling potatoes, mopping, picking up cigarette butts, etc. Recruits with desirable skills, such as typing, could end up on an office typewriter rather than in a kitchen. One winter, recruits were sent to shovel snow off roads to a largely rural area near Colora and Rising Sun.{{cn|date=February 2014}}<!---probably needs deletion. Sounds like trivia-->\n\nBy the end of World War II, the center had trained 244,277 recruits who transferred to various ships and stations throughout the world.\n\n====Non-recruit training====\nUSNTC Bainbridge also trained new boot camp graduates and other sailors in technical and other skills. During World War II, a total of 24,484 sailors completed various programs under the direction of the Service School Command<ref>[http://www.ibiblio.net/hyperwar/USN/ref/USN-Act/MD.html United States Naval Facilities World War II]</ref>.These included:\n[[File:Building Overtaken.jpg|alt=A panoramic image showing a large \"H-shaped\" building overtaken by nature due to Bainbridge's abandoning.|thumb|A panoramic image showing a large \"H-shaped\" building being overtaken by nature due to Bainbridge's abandoning. ]]\n[[File:Workshop Brick Making.jpg|alt=A brick-making workshop that has been left to rot.|thumb|A brick-making workshop that has been left to rot.]]\n\n* Coast Guard School\n* Rockefeller Research Unit (Report to Naval Training Station).\n* Stewards Mates' School Roll\n*[[Naval Academy Preparatory School]], founded in 1943.\n* Naval Hospital\n* Hospital Corps School\n* Naval Training School (Radio)\n* Naval Training School (Fire Controlmen)\n* Fire Fighters School\n* Naval Training School (Electrical)\n* Naval Training School (Physical Instructors)\n* Naval Training School (Instructors)\n* Naval Training School (Sound Motion Picture Technician)\n* Fire Fighters Training Unit\n* Naval Training School (Motion Picture Operators)\n* Naval Training School (Recruit Instructors \u2013 C)\n\n===First deactivation===\nAfter the war ended, the center continued limited operations until 30 June 1947, when it was first inactivated as a Navy training center. The sole remaining training activity on campus was the Naval Academy Prep School. A maintenance staff remained active to protect the buildings from weather and other damage. \n\n===Reactivation ===\nIn mid-1950, with the advent of the [[Korean War]] crisis, plans were made to reactivate the center, and it was officially reopened on 1 February 1951, when Captain Robert Hall Smith took overall command.\n\nDespite the care of the maintenance staff, the buildings were in severe disrepair. A contract was awarded to Consolidated Engineering Company of [[Baltimore, Maryland]]. The necessary renovations and road work were accomplished ahead of schedule, and the center reopened its gates for recruits on 5 April 1951.\n\nInitially, the center admitted 500 recruits per week, but the rate soon doubled.

Before the band's split, Dappy signed a contract with [[Takeover Entertainment|Takeover Entertainment Ltd]] that confirmed that if the band ever split or went on hiatus, he would continue as a solo artist. His first taste of solo stardom came as a guest artist on label-mate [[Kwasi Danquah III|Tinchy Stryder]]'s single \"Spaceship\", which was released in June 2011. While deciding upon his debut solo single, Dappy was contacted by Def Jam, asking him what he would like done with the demos of a track N-Dubz had recorded whilst under the label, which remained unreleased. Dappy decided to re-record the track, \"[[No Regrets (Dappy song)|No Regrets]]\", and release it as his debut solo effort. Featuring a cameo appearance from band-mate Fazer, \"No Regrets\" took the charts by storm, peaking at #1 in the UK and Scotland, and at #8 in Ireland.\n\nFollowing the success of \"No Regrets\", Dappy claimed during an interview that: \"With my solo stuff, I really want to earn the respect of an older audience.

''The Independent'' wrote, \"His lyrics combine jealousy with anger: 'You got too much to lose / You're in a great position... You wouldn't last a minute where I'm from / You'd go missing / So appreciate what you got / 'cos I'm still wishing.'

''The Independent'' wrote, \"His lyrics combine jealousy with anger: 'You got too much to lose / You're in a great position... You wouldn't last a minute where I'm from / You'd go missing / So appreciate what you got / 'cos I'm still wishing.' And then he grabs the rich kid by his coat, pulls him toward him, and punches him in the face. The silent boy falls instantly to the pavement ...

The FMLA is administered by the [[Wage and Hour Division]] of the [[United States Department of Labor]].\n\nThe FMLA allows eligible employees to take up to 12 work weeks of unpaid leave during any 12-month period to care for a new child, care for a seriously ill family member, or recover from a serious illness. The FMLA covers both public- and private-sector employees, but certain categories of employees, including elected officials and highly compensated employees, are excluded from the law or face certain limitations. In order to be eligible for FMLA leave, an employee must have worked for the employer for at least 12 months, have worked at least 1,250 hours over the past 12 months, and work for an employer with at least fifty employees. Several states have passed laws providing additional family and medical leave protections for workers.\n\n==Background==\n\nPrior to the [[1992 United States presidential election|1992 presidential election]], a family medical leave act had been vetoed twice by President [[George H. W. Bush]].<ref>{{cite book|last1=Wilentz|first1=Sean|title=The Age of Reagan|date=2008|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=978-0-06-074480-9|pp=[https://archive.org/details/ageofreaganhisto00wile/page/327 327\u2013328]|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/ageofreaganhisto00wile/page/327}}</ref> After [[Bill Clinton]] won the 1992 election, a law protecting family medical leave became one of his major first-term domestic priorities. Rapid growth in the workforce, including a large number of women joining, suggested a necessary federal regulation that would support the working class who desired to raise a family and/or required time off for illness related situations.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=46777|title=William J.

Employees must have worked over 12 months and 1250 hours in the last year (around 25 hours a week). However, employees \"at which such employer employs less than 50 employees if the total number of employees employed by that employer within 75 miles of that worksite is less than 50.\"<ref>29 USC \u00a72611(2)</ref> A worksite includes a public agency, including schools and state, local, and federal employers. The 50 employee threshold does not apply to public agency employees and local educational agencies. There are special hours rules for certain airline employees.<ref>{{cite news|title=Family and Medical Leave Act Airline Flight Crew Technical Amendments|url=http://www.dol.gov/whd/fmla/airline.htm#.UMkHuIPAdBM}}</ref>\n\nEmployees must give notice of 30 days to employers if birth or adoption is \"foreseeable\",<ref>29 USC \u00a72612(e)</ref> and for serious health conditions if practicable. Treatments should be arranged \"so as not to disrupt unduly the operations of the employer\" according to medical advice.<ref>29 USC \u00a72612(e)(2)</ref>\n\nAlong with the 30 day notice, there are also other requirements to be made when seeking the FMLA rights. If an employee wants to leave the first time using ones FMLA rights, the person must first claim the Family and Medical Leave Act.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/leave-administration/fact-sheets/family-and-medical-leave/|title=Family and Medical Leave for Federal Employees|website=U.S. Office of Personnel Management|access-date=2019-07-03}}</ref> In the case that an employee were to leave again under the FMLA act, the same process must proceed.<ref name=\"FS28\">{{cite web |title=Fact Sheet #28: The Family and Medical Leave Act |url=https://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/whdfs28.pdf |website=U.S. Department of Labor |accessdate=21 August 2019 |date=2012}}</ref>\n\nWith the release of employees, there is a [[certification]] as well. The absence of an employee due to the conditions he or she may have may require a certification as proof of the verification of absence.<ref name=\"FS28\" /> In order to certify the leave of an employee, the employer may ask for other requirements. An example of these requirements are requiring multiple medical opinions. All of these prerequisites are at the employer's [[expense]]. There are also certain rules that may apply to those who work at local education [[Institution|agencies]].<ref name=\"FS28\" />\n\n===Rights during leave===\nEmployees can have up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave for child birth, adoption, to care for a close relative in poor health, or because of an employee's own poor health.<ref>29 USC \u00a72512(a)(2) and on adoption, see ''[[Kelley v Crosfield Catalysts]]'' 135 F2d 1202 (7th Circuit 1998) The same rules for federal employees were codified in 5 USC \u00a7\u00a76381\u20136387.</ref> In full, the purposes for leave are:\n* to care for a new child, whether for the birth, the adoption, or placement of a child in foster care;\n* to care for a seriously ill family member (spouse, son, daughter, or parent) (Note: Son/daughter has been clarified by the Department of Labor to mean a child under the age of 18 or a child over the age of 18 with a mental or physical disability as defined by the Americans With Disabilities Act, which excludes, among other conditions, pregnancy and post-partum recovery from childbirth);<ref>{{cite news|title=DoL Opinion|url=http://www.dol.gov/WHD/opinion/fmla/prior2002/FMLA-51.htm}}</ref>\n* to recover from a worker's own serious illness;\n* to care for an injured service member in the family; or\n* to address qualifying exigencies arising out of a family member's deployment.\n* twenty-six workweeks of leave during a single 12-month period to care for a covered servicemember with a serious injury or illness if the eligible employee is the servicemember's spouse, son, daughter, parent, or next of kin (military caregiver leave).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dol.gov/whd/fmla/ |title=Family and Medical Leave Act \u2013 Wage and Hour Division (WHD) \u2013 U.S. Department of Labor |publisher=Dol.gov |date= |accessdate=2014-08-06}}</ref>\n\nChild care leave should be taken in one lump, unless an employer agrees otherwise.<ref>29 USC \u00a72612(a)(2)</ref> If a father and mother have the same employer, they must share their leave, in effect halving each person's rights, if the employer so chooses.<ref>29 USC \u00a72612(f) \u201cthe aggregate number of workweeks of leave to which both may be entitled may be limited to 12 workweeks\u201d</ref>\n\nEmployers must provide benefits during the unpaid leave.<ref>29 USC \u00a72614(c).

Originally the Department of Labor had a penalty to make employers notify employees that this might happen. However, five judges in the [[US Supreme Court]] in ''[[Ragsdale v Wolverine World Wide, Inc]]'' held that the statute precluded the right of the Department of Labor to do so. Four dissenting judges would have held that nothing prevented the rule, and it was the Department of Labor's job to enforce the law.<ref>[http://www.worldlii.org/us/cases/federal/USSC/2002/557.html 535 US 81] (2002)</ref>\n\n===Right to return to job===\nAfter unpaid leave, an employee generally has the right to return to their job, except for employees who are in the top 10% of highest paid and the employer can argue refusal \"is necessary to prevent substantial and grievous economic injury to the operations of the employer.\"<ref>29 USC \u00a72614(b).

They argue that employers will engage in subtle discrimination against women in the hiring process, discrimination which is much less obvious to detect than [[pregnancy discrimination]] against the already hired. Throughout history, gender discrimination towards women was common; certain laws were placed that would restrict a woman's option in choosing a working position, as well as, how many hours she could work<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Anthony|first=Deborah J.|year=2008|title=The Hidden Harms of the Family and Medical Leave Act: Gender-Neutral Versus Gender-Equal|url=http://digitalcommons.wcl.american.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1044&context=jgspl|journal=Gender, Social Policy & the Law|volume=16|pages=4|via=Digital Commons}}</ref> ei. Employers  Supporters counter that the act, in contrast to the Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978, is aimed at both women and men, and is part of an overall strategy to encourage both men and women to take family-related leave.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.dol.gov/general/topic/benefits-leave/fmla|title=FMLA (Family & Medical Leave)|date=2015-12-09|work=United States Department of Labor|access-date=2017-04-05|language=en}}</ref> However, this is based on the assumption that men will take advantage of the opportunity of unpaid leave at comparable rates to women. According to Grossman, there is no basis for this assumption upon the inception of the legislation and no evidence has been found today to support this assumption. Therefore, the employer incentive to prefer male employees is preserved despite the equal opportunity for both sexes to take leave.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Grossman|first=Joanna|date=20 April 2004|title=Job Security Without Equality: The Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993|journal=Journal of Law and Policy|volume=15|issue=17|pages=17\u201363 |url=https://openscholarship.wustl.edu/law_journal_law_policy/vol15/iss1/3}}</ref>\n\nMoreover, the FMLA is much less comprehensive than Western European leave policies. Namely, the United States is the only industrialized country without paid leave for parents. The following table illustrates the lack of provisions offered in the United States as compared to that of other industrialized countries. For instance, all Western European nations have maternity paid leave and over half have paternity and sick child care paid leave, while the United States has no paid leave.<ref name=\"Pyle 2003\">{{cite journal |last1=Pyle |first1=Jean L. |last2=Pelletier |first2=Marianne S. |title=Family and medical leave act: unresolved issues |journal=New Solutions |date=1 March 2003 |volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=353\u201384 |doi=10.2190/7K3G-MW4M-6J7X-U4EV |pmid=17208739}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n!Maternity\n!Paternity\n!Sick Child (over 3 years)\n!Sick Spouse/Parent\n!Own Illness\n|-\n|United States\n|{{ya}}\n|{{na}}\n|{{na}}\n|{{na}}\n|{{na}}\n|-\n|Austria\n|{{ya}}\n|{{CNone|{{steady}}}} \n|{{ya}}\n|{{ya}}\n|{{ya}}\n|-\n|Belgium\n|{{ya}}\n|{{ya}}\n|{{ya}}\n|{{na}}\n|{{ya}}\n|-\n|Denmark\n|{{ya}}\n|{{ya}}\n|{{ya}}\n|{{ya}}\n|{{ya}}\n|-\n|Finland\n|{{ya}}\n|{{ya}}\n|{{ya}}\n|{{na}}\n|{{ya}}\n|-\n|France\n|{{ya}}\n|{{ya}}\n|{{ya}}\n|{{CNone|{{steady}}}} \n|{{ya}}\n|-\n|Germany\n|{{ya}}\n|{{CNone|{{steady}}}} \n|{{ya}}\n|{{ya}}\n|{{ya}}\n|-\n|Greece\n|{{ya}}\n|{{CNone|{{steady}}}} \n|{{na}}\n|{{na}}\n|{{ya}}\n|-\n|Ireland\n|{{ya}}\n|{{CNone|{{steady}}}} \n|{{na}}\n|{{ya}}\n|{{ya}}\n|-\n|Italy\n|{{ya}}\n|{{CNone|{{steady}}}} \n|{{ya}}\n|{{ya}}\n|{{ya}}\n|-\n|Luxembourg\n|{{ya}}\n|{{ya}}\n|{{ya}}\n|{{ya}}\n|{{ya}}\n|-\n|Netherlands\n|{{ya}}\n|{{CNone|{{steady}}}} \n|{{na}}\n|{{CNone|{{steady}}}} \n|{{ya}}\n|-\n|Portugal\n|{{ya}}\n|{{ya}}\n|{{na}}\n|{{CNone|{{steady}}}} \n|{{ya}}\n|-\n|Spain\n|{{ya}}\n|{{ya}}\n|{{na}}\n|{{na}}\n|{{ya}}\n|-\n|Sweden\n|{{ya}}\n|{{ya}}\n|{{ya}}\n|{{ya}}\n|{{ya}}\n|-\n|United Kingdom\n|{{ya}}\n|{{na}}\n|{{na}}\n|{{na}}\n|{{ya}}\n|}\n<nowiki>*</nowiki>{{aye}} = available, {{nay}} = not available, {{steady}}  = not applicable<ref name=\"Pyle 2003\" />\n\nAdditionally, workplace fairness has been questioned under the Act. For instance, any woman-specific benefits provided by the legislation were considered special treatment and thus unacceptable, and ignoring the idea that women may have a greater share of burden of caregiving in reality. In retort, supporters may argue that creating such legislation that recognizes the female's greater role in child care,  stereotype would be reinforced.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Anthony|last2=Deborah|date=2008|title=The Hidden Harms of the Family and Medical Leave Act: Gender Neutral versus Gender Equal|journal=Journal of Gender Social Policy and the Law|volume=16|issue=4}}</ref>\n\nThe success of the implementation of the policy is also controversial because it is questioned whether the policy is actually going to those who need the benefits.

The FMLA is administered by the [[Wage and Hour Division]] of the [[United States Department of Labor]].\n\nThe FMLA allows eligible employees to take up to 12 work weeks of unpaid leave during any 12-month period to care for a new child, care for a seriously ill family member, or recover from a serious illness. The FMLA covers both public- and private-sector employees, but certain categories of employees, including elected officials and highly compensated employees, are excluded from the law or face certain limitations. In order to be eligible for FMLA leave, an employee must have worked for the employer for at least 12 months, have worked at least 1,250 hours over the past 12 months, and work for an employer with at least fifty employees. Several states have passed laws providing additional family and medical leave protections for workers.\n\n==Background==\n\nPrior to the [[1992 United States presidential election|1992 presidential election]], a family medical leave act had been vetoed twice by President [[George H. W.

Rapid growth in the workforce, including a large number of women joining, suggested a necessary federal regulation that would support the working class who desired to raise a family and/or required time off for illness related situations.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=46777|title=William J.

If an employee wants to leave the first time using ones FMLA rights, the person must first claim the Family and Medical Leave Act.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/leave-administration/fact-sheets/family-and-medical-leave/|title=Family and Medical Leave for Federal Employees|website=U.S. Office of Personnel Management|access-date=2019-07-03}}</ref> In the case that an employee were to leave again under the FMLA act, the same process must proceed.<ref name=\"FS28\">{{cite web |title=Fact Sheet #28: The Family and Medical Leave Act |url=https://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/whdfs28.pdf |website=U.S. Department of Labor |accessdate=21 August 2019 |date=2012}}</ref>\n\nWith the release of employees, there is a [[certification]] as well.

However, five judges in the [[US Supreme Court]] in ''[[Ragsdale v Wolverine World Wide, Inc]]'' held that the statute precluded the right of the Department of Labor to do so. Four dissenting judges would have held that nothing prevented the rule, and it was the Department of Labor's job to enforce the law.<ref>[http://www.worldlii.org/us/cases/federal/USSC/2002/557.html 535 US 81] (2002)</ref>\n\n===Right to return to job===\nAfter unpaid leave, an employee generally has the right to return to their job, except for employees who are in the top 10% of highest paid and the employer can argue refusal \"is necessary to prevent substantial and grievous economic injury to the operations of the employer.\"<ref>29 USC \u00a72614(b).

In June 2007, the Department of Labor estimated that of 141.7 million workers in the United States, 94.4 million worked at FMLA-covered worksites, and 76.1 million were eligible for FMLA leave. Only eight to 17.1 percent of covered, eligible workers (or between 6.1 million and 13.0 million workers) took FMLA leave in 2005.<ref>\"Family and Medical Leave Act Regulations: A Report on the Department of Labor\u2019s Request for Information.\" 28 June 2007.

Chatterji and Markowitz <ref>Chatterji, P. and Markowitz, S. 2005. \"Does the Length of Maternity Leave Affect Mental Health.\" ''Southern Economic Journal''. 72(1):16\u201341.</ref> also found an association between longer lengths of maternity leave and lesser incidence of [[Depression (mood)|depression]] among mothers.\n\nDespite the lack of rights to leave, there is no right to free [[child care]] or [[day care]]. This has encouraged several proposals to create a public system of free child care, or for the government to subsidize parents' costs.<ref>e.g. D Paquette, 'The enormous ambition of Hillary Clinton's child-care plan' (May 12, 2016) [https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/05/12/the-enormous-ambition-of-hillary-clintons-child-care-plan/ The Washington Post]</ref>\n\n==Controversy==\nCritics of the act have suggested that by mandating various forms of leave that are used more often by female than male employees, the Act, like the Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978, makes women more expensive to employ than men. They argue that employers will engage in subtle discrimination against women in the hiring process, discrimination which is much less obvious to detect than [[pregnancy discrimination]] against the already hired. Throughout history, gender discrimination towards women was common; certain laws were placed that would restrict a woman's option in choosing a working position, as well as, how many hours she could work<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Anthony|first=Deborah J.|year=2008|title=The Hidden Harms of the Family and Medical Leave Act: Gender-Neutral Versus Gender-Equal|url=http://digitalcommons.wcl.american.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1044&context=jgspl|journal=Gender, Social Policy & the Law|volume=16|pages=4|via=Digital Commons}}</ref> ei. Employers  Supporters counter that the act, in contrast to the Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978, is aimed at both women and men, and is part of an overall strategy to encourage both men and women to take family-related leave.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.dol.gov/general/topic/benefits-leave/fmla|title=FMLA (Family & Medical Leave)|date=2015-12-09|work=United States Department of Labor|access-date=2017-04-05|language=en}}</ref> However, this is based on the assumption that men will take advantage of the opportunity of unpaid leave at comparable rates to women. According to Grossman, there is no basis for this assumption upon the inception of the legislation and no evidence has been found today to support this assumption. Therefore, the employer incentive to prefer male employees is preserved despite the equal opportunity for both sexes to take leave.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Grossman|first=Joanna|date=20 April 2004|title=Job Security Without Equality: The Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993|journal=Journal of Law and Policy|volume=15|issue=17|pages=17\u201363 |url=https://openscholarship.wustl.edu/law_journal_law_policy/vol15/iss1/3}}</ref>\n\nMoreover, the FMLA is much less comprehensive than Western European leave policies. Namely, the United States is the only industrialized country without paid leave for parents. The following table illustrates the lack of provisions offered in the United States as compared to that of other industrialized countries. For instance, all Western European nations have maternity paid leave and over half have paternity and sick child care paid leave, while the United States has no paid leave.<ref name=\"Pyle 2003\">{{cite journal |last1=Pyle |first1=Jean L. |last2=Pelletier |first2=Marianne S. |title=Family and medical leave act: unresolved issues |journal=New Solutions |date=1 March 2003 |volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=353\u201384 |doi=10.2190/7K3G-MW4M-6J7X-U4EV |pmid=17208739}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!\n!Maternity\n!Paternity\n!Sick Child (over 3 years)\n!Sick Spouse/Parent\n!Own Illness\n|-\n|United States\n|{{ya}}\n|{{na}}\n|{{na}}\n|{{na}}\n|{{na}}\n|-\n|Austria\n|{{ya}}\n|{{CNone|{{steady}}}} \n|{{ya}}\n|{{ya}}\n|{{ya}}\n|-\n|Belgium\n|{{ya}}\n|{{ya}}\n|{{ya}}\n|{{na}}\n|{{ya}}\n|-\n|Denmark\n|{{ya}}\n|{{ya}}\n|{{ya}}\n|{{ya}}\n|{{ya}}\n|-\n|Finland\n|{{ya}}\n|{{ya}}\n|{{ya}}\n|{{na}}\n|{{ya}}\n|-\n|France\n|{{ya}}\n|{{ya}}\n|{{ya}}\n|{{CNone|{{steady}}}} \n|{{ya}}\n|-\n|Germany\n|{{ya}}\n|{{CNone|{{steady}}}} \n|{{ya}}\n|{{ya}}\n|{{ya}}\n|-\n|Greece\n|{{ya}}\n|{{CNone|{{steady}}}} \n|{{na}}\n|{{na}}\n|{{ya}}\n|-\n|Ireland\n|{{ya}}\n|{{CNone|{{steady}}}} \n|{{na}}\n|{{ya}}\n|{{ya}}\n|-\n|Italy\n|{{ya}}\n|{{CNone|{{steady}}}} \n|{{ya}}\n|{{ya}}\n|{{ya}}\n|-\n|Luxembourg\n|{{ya}}\n|{{ya}}\n|{{ya}}\n|{{ya}}\n|{{ya}}\n|-\n|Netherlands\n|{{ya}}\n|{{CNone|{{steady}}}} \n|{{na}}\n|{{CNone|{{steady}}}} \n|{{ya}}\n|-\n|Portugal\n|{{ya}}\n|{{ya}}\n|{{na}}\n|{{CNone|{{steady}}}} \n|{{ya}}\n|-\n|Spain\n|{{ya}}\n|{{ya}}\n|{{na}}\n|{{na}}\n|{{ya}}\n|-\n|Sweden\n|{{ya}}\n|{{ya}}\n|{{ya}}\n|{{ya}}\n|{{ya}}\n|-\n|United Kingdom\n|{{ya}}\n|{{na}}\n|{{na}}\n|{{na}}\n|{{ya}}\n|}\n<nowiki>*</nowiki>{{aye}} = available, {{nay}} = not available, {{steady}}  = not applicable<ref name=\"Pyle 2003\" />\n\nAdditionally, workplace fairness has been questioned under the Act. For instance, any woman-specific benefits provided by the legislation were considered special treatment and thus unacceptable, and ignoring the idea that women may have a greater share of burden of caregiving in reality. In retort, supporters may argue that creating such legislation that recognizes the female's greater role in child care,  stereotype would be reinforced.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Anthony|last2=Deborah|date=2008|title=The Hidden Harms of the Family and Medical Leave Act: Gender Neutral versus Gender Equal|journal=Journal of Gender Social Policy and the Law|volume=16|issue=4}}</ref>\n\nThe success of the implementation of the policy is also controversial because it is questioned whether the policy is actually going to those who need the benefits.

The Bills hoped to improve on their 6\u201310 record from the [[2009 Buffalo Bills season|2009]] season, and attempt to make the playoffs for the first time since [[1999 Buffalo Bills season|1999]]. The Bills had the 9th pick in the first round of the [[2010 NFL Draft]] selecting [[C. J. Spiller]], a [[running back]] from [[Clemson Tigers football|Clemson]]. This season marks the first 0\u20138 start since [[1984 Buffalo Bills season|1984]], in which they finished 2-14. They were eliminated from playoff contention in Week 12, extending their playoff drought to 11 seasons. Despite the poor start, Buffalo became largely competitive after the bye in Week 9. Their next four losses were by only three points each, all to teams that made the playoffs that year\u2014Baltimore, Kansas City, Chicago and Pittsburgh (three of these losses went to overtime). The Bills eventually won four of their final eight games, which carried over into a strong start to the [[2011 Buffalo Bills season|2011 season]]. The 2010 season was marked by the emergence of wide receiver [[Stevie Johnson]], who gained 1,073 receiving yards and [[nose tackle]] [[Kyle Williams (defensive tackle)|Kyle Williams]], an [[All-Pro]] in 2010 who gained status as an elite defensive tackle.<ref>[http://espn.go.com/blog/afceast/post/_/id/29870/afc-easts-best-no-11-kyle-williams ESPN: AFC East's Best \u2013 #11]</ref><ref>[http://www.profootballfocus.com/blog/2011/05/22/kyle-williams-beast/ Pro Football Focus \u2013 Kyle Williams: Beast]</ref><ref>[http://views.washingtonpost.com/theleague/smarterstats/2010/12/week-13-nfl-preview.html Washington Post \u2013 Week 13 NFL preview]</ref>\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Offseason==\nThe Bills had fired head coach [[Dick Jauron]] after Week 10 of the 2009 season; he had been replaced on an interim basis by defensive coordinator [[Perry Fewell]]. The remainder of the Jauron coaching staff was released at the end of the year, including Fewell. Former [[Dallas Cowboys]] and [[Georgia Tech Yellowjackets football|Georgia Tech]] head coach [[Chan Gailey]] was hired as the Bills' new head coach and [[Buddy Nix]] had taken over as general manager after a two-year vacancy in the position. (Current team CEO Russ Brandon had handled GM responsibilities.) Gailey installed the [[3-4 defense]] (although the team would play in a [[4-3 defense|4\u20133]] on certain downs) <ref>[http://www.footballoutsiders.com/four-downs/2011/four-downs-afc-east Football Outsiders: Four Downs \u2013 AFC East]</ref> and the \"[[Pistol offense|Pistol]]\" offensive formation. [[George Edwards (American football)|George Edwards]] was named defensive coordinator, and though Gailey stated he would call the offensive plays, [[Curtis Modkins]] was named the nominal offensive coordinator. On February 18, 2010, starting right tackle [[Brad Butler]] announced his retirement from professional football. Butler suffered a season ending (ultimately a career ending) knee injury vs. the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] in week 2 of the 2009 season. The Bills held an open competition for the starting [[quarterback]] position between [[Trent Edwards]], [[Ryan Fitzpatrick]] and [[Brian Brohm]] during training camp. Edwards was named starter prior to the first preseason game, but was released from the team after two poor performances. Fitzpatrick took over in Week 3 and, in 13 games, became the first Bills quarterback to throw for 3,000 passing yards in a season since [[J. P. Losman]] in [[2006 Buffalo Bills season|2006]].<ref>[https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/buf/2010.htm Pro Football Reference \u2013 2010 Buffalo Bills]</ref><ref>[https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/buf/2006.htm}]</ref>\n\n===2010 Draft===\n{{main|2010 NFL Draft}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:auto;\"\n|+ 2010 Buffalo Bills Draft Selections\n!

This was followed by QB [[Kellen Clemens]] scrambling 10&nbsp;yards for a touchdown, then with RB [[John Conner (American football)|John Conner]] getting a 16-yard TD run.\n\nWith the loss, the Bills finish with a 4\u201312 record.\n\n{{AmFootballScoreSummaryStart|VisitorName=Bills|HomeName=Jets|state=collapsed}}\n{{AmFootballScoreSummaryEntry\n| Quarter=1\n| Time=4:58\n| Team=Jets\n| DrivePlays=12\n| DriveLength=79\n| DriveTime=7:30\n| Type=FG\n| yards=28\n| Kicker=[[Nick Folk]]\n| Visitor=0\n| Home=3\n}}\n{{AmFootballScoreSummaryEntry\n| Quarter=2\n| Time=9:07\n| Team=Jets\n| DrivePlays=\n| DriveLength=\n| DriveTime=\n| Type=IntTD\n| Def=[[Maurice Cole]]\n| yards=35\n| kickresult=good\n| Kicker=Nick Folk\n| 2pt type=run/pass\n| 2pt result=good/failed/incomplete\n| Visitor=0\n| Home=10\n}}\n{{AmFootballScoreSummaryEntry\n| Quarter=2\n| Time=0:15\n| Team=Jets\n| DrivePlays=8\n| DriveLength=59\n| DriveTime=1:45\n| Type=RecTD\n| Receiver=[[Santonio Holmes]]\n| QB=[[Mark Brunell]]\n| yards=17\n| kickresult=good\n| Kicker=Nick Folk\n| 2pt type=run/pass\n| 2pt result=good/failed/incomplete\n| Visitor=0\n| Home=17\n}}\n{{AmFootballScoreSummaryEntry\n| Quarter=3\n| Time=13:06\n| Team=Bills\n| DrivePlays=\n| DriveLength=\n| DriveTime=\n| Type=IntTD\n| Def=[[Jairus Byrd]]\n| yards=37\n| kickresult= good\n| Kicker=[[Rian Lindell]]\n| 2pt type=run/pass\n| 2pt result=good/failed/incomplete\n| Visitor=7\n| Home=17\n}}\n{{AmFootballScoreSummaryEntry\n| Quarter=3\n| Time=6:41\n| Team=Jets\n| DrivePlays=2\n| DriveLength=58\n| DriveTime=0:46\n| Type=RecTD\n| Receiver=[[Braylon Edwards]]\n| QB=Mark Brunell\n| yards=52\n| kickresult= good\n| Kicker=Nick Folk\n| 2pt type=run/pass\n| 2pt result=good/failed/incomplete\n| Visitor=7\n| Home=24\n}}\n{{AmFootballScoreSummaryEntry\n| Quarter=4\n| Time=9:18\n| Team=Jets\n| DrivePlays=5\n| DriveLength=27\n| DriveTime=2:31\n| Type=RushTD\n| Runner=[[Kellen Clemens]]\n| yards=10\n| kickresult= good\n| Kicker=Nick Folk\n| 2pt type=run/pass\n| 2pt result=good/failed/incomplete\n| Visitor=7\n| Home=31\n}}\n{{AmFootballScoreSummaryEntry\n| Quarter=4\n| Time=6:45\n| Team=Jets\n| DrivePlays=5\n| DriveLength=34\n| DriveTime=2:17\n| Type=RushTD\n| Runner=[[John Conner (American football)|John Conner]]\n| yards=16\n| kickresult=good\n| Kicker=Nick Folk\n| 2pt type=run/pass\n| 2pt result=good/failed/incomplete\n| Visitor=7\n| Home=38\n}}\n{{AmFootballScoreSummaryEnd|Visitor=7|Home=38}}\n\n==References==\n{{Commons category|2010 Buffalo Bills season}}\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Buffalo Bills}}\n{{Buffalo Bills seasons}}\n{{2010 NFL season by team}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:2010 Buffalo Bills Season}}\n[[Category:2010 National Football League season by team|Buffalo]]\n[[Category:Buffalo Bills seasons]]\n[[Category:Bills Toronto Series]]\n[[Category:2010 in sports in New York (state)|Buffalo Bills]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|51st season in franchise history}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=November 2013}}\n{{Infobox NFL season\n| logo =\n| team = Buffalo Bills\n| year = 2010\n| record = 4\u201312 <!-- Do not add zero ties -->\n| division_place = 4th [[AFC East]]\n| coach = [[Chan Gailey]]\n| general manager = [[Buddy Nix]]\n| owner = [[Ralph Wilson]]\n| stadium = [[Ralph Wilson Stadium]]<br />[[Rogers Centre]] (Week 9)\n| playoffs = ''did not qualify ''\n| pro bowlers = DT [[Kyle Williams (defensive tackle)|Kyle Williams]] \n| uniform =\n| shortnavlink    = Bills seasons\n}}\nThe '''2010 Buffalo Bills season''' was the team's 41st season in the [[National Football League]] and their 51st overall. It was Buffalo's first season with [[Buddy Nix]] in the role of general manager and head coach [[Chan Gailey]]. The Bills hoped to improve on their 6\u201310 record from the [[2009 Buffalo Bills season|2009]] season, and attempt to make the playoffs for the first time since [[1999 Buffalo Bills season|1999]], the longest standing playoff drought in the NFL. The Bills had the 9th pick in the first round of the [[2010 NFL Draft]] selecting [[C. J. Spiller]], a [[running back]] from [[Clemson Tigers football|Clemson]]. This season marks the first 0\u20138 start since [[1984 Buffalo Bills season|1984]], in which they finished 2-14. They were eliminated from playoff contention in Week 12, extending their playoff drought to 11 seasons. Despite the poor start, Buffalo became largely competitive after the bye in Week 9. Their next four losses were by only three points each, all to teams that made the playoffs that year\u2014Baltimore, Kansas City, Chicago and Pittsburgh (three of these losses went to overtime). The Bills eventually won four of their final eight games, which carried over into a strong start to the [[2011 Buffalo Bills season|2011 season]]. The 2010 season was marked by the emergence of wide receiver [[Stevie Johnson]], who gained 1,073 receiving yards and [[nose tackle]] [[Kyle Williams (defensive tackle)|Kyle Williams]], an [[All-Pro]] in 2010 who gained status as an elite defensive tackle.<ref>[http://espn.go.com/blog/afceast/post/_/id/29870/afc-easts-best-no-11-kyle-williams ESPN: AFC East's Best \u2013 #11]</ref><ref>[http://www.profootballfocus.com/blog/2011/05/22/kyle-williams-beast/ Pro Football Focus \u2013 Kyle Williams: Beast]</ref><ref>[http://views.washingtonpost.com/theleague/smarterstats/2010/12/week-13-nfl-preview.html Washington Post \u2013 Week 13 NFL preview]</ref>\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n==Offseason==\nThe Bills had fired head coach [[Dick Jauron]] after Week 10 of the 2009 season; he had been replaced on an interim basis by defensive coordinator [[Perry Fewell]]. The remainder of the Jauron coaching staff was released at the end of the year, including Fewell. Former [[Dallas Cowboys]] and [[Georgia Tech Yellowjackets football|Georgia Tech]] head coach [[Chan Gailey]] was hired as the Bills' new head coach and [[Buddy Nix]] had taken over as general manager after a two-year vacancy in the position. (Current team CEO Russ Brandon had handled GM responsibilities.) Gailey installed the [[3-4 defense]] (although the team would play in a [[4-3 defense|4\u20133]] on certain downs) <ref>[http://www.footballoutsiders.com/four-downs/2011/four-downs-afc-east Football Outsiders: Four Downs \u2013 AFC East]</ref> and the \"[[Pistol offense|Pistol]]\" offensive formation. [[George Edwards (American football)|George Edwards]] was named defensive coordinator, and though Gailey stated he would call the offensive plays, [[Curtis Modkins]] was named the nominal offensive coordinator. On February 18, 2010, starting right tackle [[Brad Butler]] announced his retirement from professional football. Butler suffered a season ending (ultimately a career ending) knee injury vs. the [[Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] in week 2 of the 2009 season. The Bills held an open competition for the starting [[quarterback]] position between [[Trent Edwards]], [[Ryan Fitzpatrick]] and [[Brian Brohm]] during training camp. Edwards was named starter prior to the first preseason game, but was released from the team after two poor performances. Fitzpatrick took over in Week 3 and, in 13 games, became the first Bills quarterback to throw for 3,000 passing yards in a season since [[J. P. Losman]] in [[2006 Buffalo Bills season|2006]].<ref>[https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/buf/2010.htm Pro Football Reference \u2013 2010 Buffalo Bills]</ref><ref>[https://www.pro-football-reference.com/teams/buf/2006.htm}]</ref>\n\n===2010 Draft===\n{{main|2010 NFL Draft}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin:auto;\"\n|+ 2010 Buffalo Bills Draft Selections\n!
