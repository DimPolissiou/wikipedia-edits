He was featured as [[Ward Cleaver]] in the movie version of ''[[Leave It to Beaver (film)|Leave It to Beaver]]'' and famous baseball broadcaster [[Mel Allen]] in ''[[61*]]''. In 1994, he starred in the film ''[[Terminal Velocity (film)|Terminal Velocity]]'' as an aggressive Russian mafia villain.\n\nIn television, along with a starring role on the TV series ''[[Family Law (TV series)|Family Law]]'', and recurring roles on ''[[North Shore (TV series)|North Shore]]'', ''[[Veronica's Closet]]'', ''[[Good Advice (TV series)|Good Advice]]'', and ''[[Harry's Law]]'', McDonald has also made guest appearances on ''[[Cheers]]'', ''[[Riptide (American TV series)|Riptide]]'', ''[[Knight Rider (1982 TV series)|Knight Rider]]'', ''[[The Sopranos]]'', ''[[Psych]]'', both the [[The Twilight Zone (1985 TV series)|1985]] and the [[The Twilight Zone (2002 TV series)|2002]] versions of ''[[The Twilight Zone]]'', ''[[Home Improvement (TV series)|Home Improvement]]'', ''[[Las Vegas (TV series)|Las Vegas]]'', the [[Law & Order (franchise)|''Law & Order'' franchise]], ''[[Stargate Universe]]'', and ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' as Lt.

He also voiced [[Jor-El]] in ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'' and subsequently an older version of [[Superman]] in ''[[Batman Beyond]]''. He has recalled great affection for these roles, saying that he enjoyed them because he was (and continues to be) such a fan of Superman and because they were in such contrast to the less than sympathetic onscreen roles for which he is known.

In 2009, McDonald also lent his voice talents in the [[Thomas Nelson (publisher)|Thomas Nelson]] audio Bible production known as ''The Word of Promise''.

He was featured as [[Ward Cleaver]] in the movie version of ''[[Leave It to Beaver (film)|Leave It to Beaver]]'' and famous baseball broadcaster [[Mel Allen]] in ''[[61*]]''. In 1994, he starred in the film ''[[Terminal Velocity (film)|Terminal Velocity]]'' as an aggressive Russian mafia villain.\n\nIn television, along with a starring role on the TV series ''[[Family Law (TV series)|Family Law]]'', and recurring roles on ''[[North Shore (TV series)|North Shore]]'', ''[[Veronica's Closet]]'', ''[[Good Advice (TV series)|Good Advice]]'', and ''[[Harry's Law]]'', McDonald has also made guest appearances on ''[[Cheers]]'', ''[[Riptide (American TV series)|Riptide]]'', ''[[Knight Rider (1982 TV series)|Knight Rider]]'', ''[[The Sopranos]]'', ''[[Psych]]'', both the [[The Twilight Zone (1985 TV series)|1985]] and the [[The Twilight Zone (2002 TV series)|2002]] versions of ''[[The Twilight Zone]]'', ''[[Home Improvement (TV series)|Home Improvement]]'', ''[[Las Vegas (TV series)|Las Vegas]]'', the [[Law & Order (franchise)|''Law & Order'' franchise]], ''[[Stargate Universe]]'', and ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' as Lt.

He also voiced [[Jor-El]] in ''[[Superman: The Animated Series]]'' and subsequently an older version of [[Superman]] in ''[[Batman Beyond]]''.

This can be a common method of entry for many trained police officers who are conducting warranted searches, and the \"macho\" concept of kicking in doors has frequently been glamorized on various police procedural television shows. Kicking in a locked door is also sometimes attempted or performed by neighbors and ordinary passers-by who witness an emergency situation such as a house that is on fire (though the first step should always be to call [[emergency services]]) in order to ensure that everyone is out of the house or to notify/assist anyone who is not. Kicking in doors is less commonly used in burglary attempts since the process requires a great deal of energy and makes a lot of noise.\n\n==Types==\n=== Mechanical ===\n[[File:2 ram hit.jpg|right|thumb|upright|A battering ram is used to breach a training door]]\nMechanical breaching can be minimally destructive, through the use of [[lock picking|lock picks]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://householdprof.com/best-door-knobs-buyers-guide/|title=Door Knobs in 2019 Guide and Review|last=Haris|first=Hofelner|date=2019-12-05|website=Household Professor|language=en-US|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2019-12-07}}</ref> This method is relatively slow and requires a trained operator, but does not damage the lock or door. Using specialized tools (i.e.: [[A-tool]], [[K-tool]]), a lock cylinder can also be quickly dismantled and unlocked without removing it from the door; this method also allows the door to be closed and re-locked. Mechanical breaching also includes hydraulic breaching, which uses a special hydraulic ram to overcome the lock. The hydraulic ram may be powered manually, pneumatically, or electrically. More dynamic methods (kinetic breaching) use force to break the lock or door. The common methods are to use a lever, such as a [[Halligan bar]] or [[Crowbar (tool)|crowbar]], or to use a tool to concentrate a large amount of force on the door, such as a [[sledgehammer]], [[hydraulic jack]], or [[battering ram]].<ref name=trmag>{{cite journal |url=http://www.hendonpub.com/publications/tacticalresponse/forcedentry.aspx |title=Action Target\u2019s Tactical Breach Door |author=Don Munson |journal=Tactical Response Magazine}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.firerescue1.com/fire-products/Emergency-Response-Tools/articles/288215-Back-to-Basics-Forcible-Entry/ |title=Back to Basics: Forcible Entry |last1=LaFemina |first1=Fred |website=FireRescue1 |access-date=11 September 2016 |quote=}}</ref>\n\n=== Ballistic ===\n[[File:Ballistic breach fm3-06-11fig3-26.gif|thumb|left|Suggested target locations for breaching a door at the latch (left) and the hinges (right)]]\nBallistic breaching uses a projectile weapon to breach an opening. Weapons used can range from small arms to the 120&nbsp;mm cannon of a [[main battle tank]] with a [[high explosive anti tank|HEAT]] round, which will breach most obstacles easily, though the force involved may violate the [[rules of engagement]].<ref name=fm7-8>{{cite book |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/policy/army/fm/7-8/ch6.htm |title=FM 7-8 INFANTRY RIFLE PLATOON AND SQUAD |author=US Army}} Chapter 6, Urban Operations</ref> A less damaging ballistic breach needs to destroy either the latch and lock, or the hinges of the door, and the ideal choice for this is the [[shotgun]]. While in theory other [[firearm]]s can be used, [[handgun]]s are usually underpowered<ref>See [[List of MythBusters special episodes#Special 9 \u2014 \"Mega Movie Myths 2 Hour Special\"|Mythbusters Special 9]]</ref> and [[rifle]]s are less effective than the shotgun and pose a far higher risk of ricochet and collateral injury.<ref name=fm7-8 /> Most shotgun ammunition can be used for breaching, though the risk of injury varies with type. Of the available shotgun ammunition, [[shotgun slug]]s pose the highest risk, as they will retain significant energy to cause lethal wounds well after they have penetrated the door. Buckshot is far safer and [[birdshot]] even more so, as the multiple small projectiles disperse quickly after penetration, reducing the chances of causing a lethal wound. The safest option is a frangible round such as the TESAR or [[Hatton round]], which turns to dust upon penetrating the door, and disperses completely upon exit.<ref name=fm />\n\nBreaching a door with the fewest shots possible both is faster and reduces the chance of collateral damage. Attacking the latch and lock is easiest, as it requires fewer shots and is easiest to target, whereas attacking the hinges requires more shots, and the hinges may be hidden from the outside. Careful aim is required; shots to the lock side are fired at a point halfway between the lock or handle and the door frame in order to hit the bolt holding the door shut. According to US urban warfare doctrine, the breaching operation is performed with the muzzle in contact with the door, or as close as possible, and angled downwards at a 45 degree angle. This process provides the best chance of hitting the desired point, while minimizing risk to occupants of the room being breached. Muzzle attachments are available on some specialized breaching shotguns to facilitate this operation, by holding the barrel securely in place while providing a slight standoff to allow powder gases to escape.<ref name=fm /><ref>The {{cite web |url=http://www.mossberg.com/images/Mossberg_Guns/930/New/54125.jpg |title=Mossberg 500 Tactical Cruiser |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080216043932/http://www.mossberg.com/images/Mossberg_Guns/930/New/54125.jpg |archive-date=2008-02-16 |df= }}is equipped with a standoff door breaching barrel</ref>\n\nMagazine capacity and operating mechanism are also important considerations in a breaching shotgun, because to quickly breach a door requires the ability to quickly fire multiple shots. For a breach on the latch side, US doctrine calls for two shots to be fired, and then an attempt made to open the door. If the door cannot be opened, the process would need to be quickly repeated. If the hinges must be breached, then doctrine calls for a total of three shots, one per hinge followed by an attempt to open the door.<ref name=fm />\n\n=== Hydraulic ===\nHydraulic breaching has many added values comparing to the other methods of breaching, Hydraulic tools enable a use of large force with a high work rate, relatively high level of controlling the breaching results. However, the hydraulic tools today are very big in size and weight, with limited maneuvering capabilities and are normally used by [[Firefighter|Fire fighters]] and [[Search and rescue|Rescue teams]]. [[Special forces|Military and Police Special Forces]] in dense areas will normally use tactical breaching systems which are electro-hydraulic gear  as [https://santactical.com/ SAN Ltd], this solution enables the operator to have a low footprint system in weight and design which\u00a0keeps the end user fatigue while the breaching operation is conducted by one operator behind a secured location,it will also allowing to  obtain powerful set of tools that can break into any structure in top speed while utilizing the \"surprise element\".\n\n=== Explosive ===\nExplosive breaching can be the fastest method, though it is also the most dangerous, to both the breachers and the room occupants. Depending on the situation, explosive breaching is potentially slower than a ballistic breach due to the large standoff required when using explosives, if there is no cover available.<ref name=fm7-8 /> Breaching can be performed with a specially formed breaching charge placed in contact with the door, or with various standoff breaching devices, such as specialized [[rifle grenade]]s like the [[SIMON breach grenade]].<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.ausa.org/publications/armymagazine/archive/2007/4/Documents/SA_0407.pdf |date=April 2007 |title=M100 Grenade Rifle Entry Munition |author=Scott R.

{"title_page": "Grand pensionary", "text_new": "{{short description|Political office}}\n{{no footnotes|date=August 2019}}__NOTOC__\nThe '''grand pensionary''' ({{lang-nl|raadpensionaris}}) was the most important Dutch official during the time of the [[Dutch Republic]]. [[De jure|In theory]], a grand pensionary was merely a civil servant of the Estates of the dominant province, the [[County of Holland]], among the Seven United Provinces. [[De facto|In practice]], the grand pensionary of Holland was the political leader of the entire Dutch Republic when there was no [[stadtholder]] at the centre of power.\n\nThe position of the grand pensionary is not easily expressed in modern political terms and is sometimes compared to that of a [[prime minister]]. Fundamental differences are that a ''raadpensionaris'' had no fellow ministers and no head of state above him.\n\n==Etymology==\nIts Dutch name, {{lang|nl|raadpensionaris}}, can be literally translated as \"councillor pensionary\". A pensionary in general was a lawyer paid by a city council to advise them on a permanent basis. Because of the regular payments he was a ''pensionarius'' in mediaeval [[Latin]]. Such a person was called a ''stadsadvocaat'' in the Dutch language. The [[States of Holland|States of Holland and West-Friesland]] had a pensionary who was a council member, a ''raad'', himself. He was, therefore, ''Raedt ende Pensionaris'' in seventeenth-century Dutch, which later was simplified to ''raadpensionaris'' or ''raadspensionaris''. French diplomats referred to the ''raadpensionaris'' of Holland as the ''Grand-pensionnaire'', to discern him from comparable officials in Dutch provinces of lesser importance. This embellishment was not used by the Dutch themselves. In English the French was translated as \"Grand Pensionary\". The Estates of the province of [[Zeeland|Zealand]] also had a ''raadpensionaris'', which also could be referred to as a Grand Pensionary. The provinces of [[Groningen (province)|Groningen]] and [[Gelderland]] had a simple ''pensionaris''. The provinces of [[Utrecht (province)|Utrecht]] and [[Friesland]] had a ''landsadvocaat'' (lawyer of the homeland). \n\n== History ==\nThe office started in 1619 and replaced the title of [[Land's Advocate of Holland|land's advocate]]. If the position of stadtholder of Holland was filled, then the grand pensionary was often the second leader of the Republic. Being the ''raadpensionaris'' of Holland, the grand pensionary acted as the chairman of States of Holland. He was appointed by the Estates but could also instantly be fired by the Estates. The city council of [[Dordrecht|Dort]], which was seen as the oldest city of Holland, had the right to nominate a new grand pensionary.\n\nSessions of the Estates were ruled by a procedure that was very different from that of modern parliaments. No votes were held on some proposal and there was no round of debates. The grand pensionary controlled the agenda. He introduced a subject and then invited the members to state their opinions, which was done in a fixed order, reflecting the dates the cities they represented had been given [[city right]]s. At the end, the grand pensionary summarised each of the statements of the delegates, with an implicit conclusion about what collective decision had been made by this. This way, if he was a competent man, he could control the entire decision-making process, especially as one of his duties was to represent the ten members of the nobility delegates\u2014the {{lang|nl|[[ridderschap]]}}\u2014in their absence and phrase the single opinion they as a body had the right to express. The office existed because all delegates of the States were, although ranked according to ancient feudal hierarchy, still basically equal and none among them could thus act as a head.\n\nThe grand pensionary also took care of the total correspondence of the Estates. He thus handled communications with lower administrative bodies, the other provinces of the Republic, the [[States General of the Netherlands]], and foreign powers. This means his function combined elements of the duties performed by modern ministers of internal and foreign affairs. Letters to the Estates could be read by all the members. Therefore messages of a more secretive nature were sent to the grand pensionary personally. Large parts of the correspondence of the various grand pensionaries have been preserved, forming an important source of information for later historians. The diplomatic contacts of the Republic were in principle managed by the States General. However, they were ill equipped to receive and entertain envoys with the pomposity needed in the seventeenth century to avoid offending foreign rulers. In practice, this was delegated to the court of the stadtholder of Holland, who also resided at The Hague. When no stadtholder was appointed, the grand pensionary received envoys.\n\nThe [[Batavian Republic]] of 1795 first abolished the office but in the last year of the [[Batavian Commonwealth]], 1805\u20131806, the title had to be reinstituted on orders of [[Napoleon]] as part of a number of measures to strengthen the executive power; [[Rutger Jan Schimmelpenninck]] thus functioned for a short time as the last grand pensionary. He officially functioned as a president of the entire Republic, not just of Holland. In June 1806, [[Carel de Vos van Steenwijk]] was for two weeks acting grand pensionary as part of a transitional arrangement.\n\nThe most famous and significant grand pensionary was [[Johan de Witt]], who held the office between 1653 and 1672. [[Johan van Oldenbarnevelt]], who played a crucial role in the Dutch struggle for independence equalled him in influence, though he held the position when it was still called land's advocate.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of Grand Pensionaries]]\n\n== References ==\n* {{cite book|last = Brouwer|first = M.|date = 2008|title = Governance and Innovation|location = New York|publisher = Routledge|isbn = 9780415437059|ref = harv}}\n* {{cite book|last = Rowen|first = H.

When no stadtholder was appointed, the grand pensionary received envoys.\n\nThe [[Batavian Republic]] of 1795 first abolished the office but in the last year of the [[Batavian Commonwealth]], 1805\u20131806, the title had to be reinstituted on orders of [[Napoleon]] as part of a number of measures to strengthen the executive power; [[Rutger Jan Schimmelpenninck]] thus functioned for a short time as the last grand pensionary. He officially functioned as a president of the entire Republic, not just of Holland. In June 1806, [[Carel de Vos van Steenwijk]] was for two weeks acting grand pensionary as part of a transitional arrangement.\n\nThe most famous and significant grand pensionary was [[Johan de Witt]], who held the office between 1653 and 1672. [[Johan van Oldenbarnevelt]], who played a crucial role in the Dutch struggle for independence equalled him in influence, though he held the position when it was still called land's advocate.\n\n== See also ==\n* [[List of Grand Pensionaries]]\n\n== References ==\n* {{cite book|last = Brouwer|first = M.|date = 2008|title = Governance and Innovation|location = New York|publisher = Routledge|isbn = 9780415437059|ref = harv}}\n* {{cite book|last = Rowen|first = H.

It is a [[List of modernized retellings of old stories|modern adaptation]] of [[George Bernard Shaw]]'s play ''[[Pygmalion (play)|Pygmalion]]'' and [[George Cukor]]'s 1964 film ''[[My Fair Lady (film)|My Fair Lady]]''. It was one of the most popular [[teen film]]s of the late 1990s and reached No. 1 at the box office in its first week of release.<ref name=\"mojo\" />\n\n== Plot ==\nZackary Siler ([[Freddie Prinze Jr.]]) is the big man on campus at his [[Southern California]] [[high school]]. His popular and narcissistic girlfriend, Taylor Vaughan ([[Jodi Lyn O'Keefe]]), ditches him for a crude reality TV star from ''[[The Real World]]'', Brock Hudson ([[Matthew Lillard]]), whom she met on Spring Break in Florida. Zack consoles himself, claiming that Taylor is replaceable by any girl in the school. Zack's friend, Dean Sampson, Jr. ([[Paul Walker]]), disagrees and challenges him to a bet on whether Zack can turn any random girl into the Prom Queen within six weeks. Dean chooses Laney Boggs ([[Rachael Leigh Cook]]), a dorky, solitary, unpopular art student.\n\nZack attempts to befriend Laney, but fails utterly, as she pointedly ignores his advances and walks away. Zack's sister Mac ([[Anna Paquin]]) encourages him to try again, and make a proper effort to get to learn what Laney is interested in and cares about. Zack approaches Laney again at her workplace and with the help of Laney's childhood friend, Jesse Jackson ([[Elden Henson]]) convinces her to give him a chance. Laney takes him to a small theater lounge where she will be performing. Intending to deter him, Laney has Zack called on stage to perform. Zack manages to improvise a show with the [[Hacky Sack]] he happens to carry in his pocket. Laney is impressed by the performance, but rejects him again after he attempts to charm her.\n\nZack befriends her brother, Simon ([[Kieran Culkin]]), and in an attempt to stop this, Laney agrees to go to the beach with him once. Dean unexpectedly shows up with the popular crowd, and Laney gets a chance to know them all. Preston ([[Dul\u00e9 Hill]]) invites them to a party at his house that night. Laney pretends to be busy but Zack persuades her go, and enlists his sister to give her a makeover, transforming her and revealing her true beauty. At Preston's, Taylor is embarrassed by Brock and jealous of Laney, who she publicly humiliates and bringing her to tears. Outside Zack consoles Laney, telling her that by opening up to people there will be some bad with the good.\n\nNewly popular, Laney is surprised to be nominated for Prom Queen and competes with Taylor for the crown. Zack and Laney begin to genuinely fall for each other; Taylor is humiliated when Brock ends their relationship, as he is leaving for [[Road Rules: All Stars]]. Dean begins to show an interest in Laney, aggravating Zack. Dean tries to invite Laney to prom, but she refuses. After falling out with Zack, Dean deliberately tells Laney about the bet and she forces a confession from Zack in public. Humiliated, Laney refuses to see Zack again.\n\nUnable to reconcile with Laney, Zack takes his sister to the prom, while Taylor arrives alone, thinking that Zack is still interested in her despite his refusal of her advances. A disheartened Laney reluctantly dresses up after some persuasion from her father Wayne ([[Kevin Pollak]]) and goes to the dance with Dean after he shows up at her house in a tuxedo to invite her again to be his prom date.\n\nAt the prom, after a dance scene presided over by the school's resident DJ ([[Usher (entertainer)|Usher Raymond]]), Mac meets Jesse and they become friends. In the bathroom Dean boasts that he is succeeding in seducing Laney and has rented a hotel room with intention of having sex with her. Jesse overhears, and tries to tell Mac and they rush to warn Zack. Taylor is crowned Prom Queen with just over half the votes. Laney is magnanimous, as she believes the right person won, and leaves the prom with Dean. Zack attempts to intervene but is too late and loses track of them.\n\nLaney returns home, to find her father and Simon waiting up for her, and Zack is there waiting too. Laney explains how she fought off Dean's advances by deafening him with an [[Air horn#Portable or personal air horns|air horn]]. Zack confesses his true feelings to Laney, and asks for forgiveness as well as the chance to further their relationship, which she grants and the two officially become a couple. Laney tells Zack that she is considering art school after graduation, and Zack jokingly tells her that she has inspired him to pursue a career in performance art. After they dance and kiss, Laney asks Zack about the bet, and Zack responds that he will honor the terms.\n\nAt the graduation ceremony, it is revealed, that Zack must appear nude on stage. Zack is wearing only a graduation cap and strategically carrying a [[soccer ball]] to cover himself. Zack takes the stage, Laney catches the soccer ball and reacts with a smile, as the students applaud.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Freddie Prinze, Jr.]] as Zachary \"Zack\" Siler\n* [[Rachael Leigh Cook]] as Laney Boggs\n* [[Paul Walker]] as Dean Sampson, Jr.\n* [[Matthew Lillard]] as Brock Hudson\n* [[Jodi Lyn O'Keefe]] as Taylor Vaughan\n* [[Kevin Pollak]] as Wayne Boggs\n* [[Usher (entertainer)|Usher Raymond]] as Campus DJ\n* [[Lil' Kim|Kimberly \"Lil' Kim\" Jones]] as Alex Chason Sawyer\n* [[Anna Paquin]] as Mackenzie \"Mac\" Siler\n* [[Kieran Culkin]] as Simon Boggs\n* [[Elden Henson]] as Jesse Jackson\n* [[Sarah Michelle Gellar]] as Girl in Cafeteria (''uncredited'')<ref name=\"Greco\" /><ref name=\"Macatee\" />{{efn|Named in the credits under ''The Producers Wish To Thank'', subsection ''They're All That''.}}\n* [[Gabrielle Union]] as Katarina \"Katie\" Darlingson\n* [[Dul\u00e9 Hill]] as Preston\n* [[Tamara Mello]] as Chandler\n* [[Clea DuVall]] as Misty\n* [[Tim Matheson]] as Harlan Siler\n* [[Alexis Arquette]] as Mitch\n* [[Chris Owen (actor)|Chris Owen]] as Derek Funkhouser Rutley\n* [[Vanessa Lee Chester]] as Melissa's Friend\n* [[Milo Ventimiglia]] as Soccer Player\n* [[Takbir Bashir]] as Rapper\n* [[Brandon Mychal Smith]] as JV Cleaning Boy\n* [[Flex Alexander]] as Kadeem\n* [[Debbi Morgan]] as Laney's Art Teacher\n* [[Carlos Jacott]] as Prom Photographer\n* [[Michael Milhoan]] as Principal Stickley\n* [[Patricia Charbonneau]] as Lois Siler\n* Katharine Towne as Savannah\n}}\n\n== Production ==\n{{Anchor|Casting}}\nThe film had an impressive ensemble cast of up-and-coming actors, including Kieran Culkin, Oscar winner Anna Paquin, musician Usher Raymond, Gabrielle Union in her film debut, Dul\u00e9 Hill and [[Lil' Kim]].

It was one of the most popular [[teen film]]s of the late 1990s and reached No. 1 at the box office in its first week of release.<ref name=\"mojo\" />\n\n== Plot ==\nZackary Siler ([[Freddie Prinze Jr.]]) is the big man on campus at his [[Southern California]] [[high school]]. His popular and narcissistic girlfriend, Taylor Vaughan ([[Jodi Lyn O'Keefe]]), ditches him for a crude reality TV star from ''[[The Real World]]'', Brock Hudson ([[Matthew Lillard]]), whom she met on Spring Break in Florida. Zack consoles himself, claiming that Taylor is replaceable by any girl in the school. Zack's friend, Dean Sampson, Jr. ([[Paul Walker]]), disagrees and challenges him to a bet on whether Zack can turn any random girl into the Prom Queen within six weeks. Dean chooses Laney Boggs ([[Rachael Leigh Cook]]), a dorky, solitary, unpopular art student.\n\nZack attempts to befriend Laney, but fails utterly, as she pointedly ignores his advances and walks away. Zack's sister Mac ([[Anna Paquin]]) encourages him to try again, and make a proper effort to get to learn what Laney is interested in and cares about. Zack approaches Laney again at her workplace and with the help of Laney's childhood friend, Jesse Jackson ([[Elden Henson]]) convinces her to give him a chance. Laney takes him to a small theater lounge where she will be performing. Intending to deter him, Laney has Zack called on stage to perform. Zack manages to improvise a show with the [[Hacky Sack]] he happens to carry in his pocket. Laney is impressed by the performance, but rejects him again after he attempts to charm her.\n\nZack befriends her brother, Simon ([[Kieran Culkin]]), and in an attempt to stop this, Laney agrees to go to the beach with him once. Dean unexpectedly shows up with the popular crowd, and Laney gets a chance to know them all. Preston ([[Dul\u00e9 Hill]]) invites them to a party at his house that night. Laney pretends to be busy but Zack persuades her go, and enlists his sister to give her a makeover, transforming her and revealing her true beauty. At Preston's, Taylor is embarrassed by Brock and jealous of Laney, who she publicly humiliates and bringing her to tears. Outside Zack consoles Laney, telling her that by opening up to people there will be some bad with the good.\n\nNewly popular, Laney is surprised to be nominated for Prom Queen and competes with Taylor for the crown. Zack and Laney begin to genuinely fall for each other; Taylor is humiliated when Brock ends their relationship, as he is leaving for [[Road Rules: All Stars]]. Dean begins to show an interest in Laney, aggravating Zack. Dean tries to invite Laney to prom, but she refuses. After falling out with Zack, Dean deliberately tells Laney about the bet and she forces a confession from Zack in public. Humiliated, Laney refuses to see Zack again.\n\nUnable to reconcile with Laney, Zack takes his sister to the prom, while Taylor arrives alone, thinking that Zack is still interested in her despite his refusal of her advances. A disheartened Laney reluctantly dresses up after some persuasion from her father Wayne ([[Kevin Pollak]]) and goes to the dance with Dean after he shows up at her house in a tuxedo to invite her again to be his prom date.\n\nAt the prom, after a dance scene presided over by the school's resident DJ ([[Usher (entertainer)|Usher Raymond]]), Mac meets Jesse and they become friends. In the bathroom Dean boasts that he is succeeding in seducing Laney and has rented a hotel room with intention of having sex with her. Jesse overhears, and tries to tell Mac and they rush to warn Zack. Taylor is crowned Prom Queen with 54% the votes. Laney is magnanimous, as she believes the right person won, and leaves the prom with Dean. Zack attempts to intervene but is too late and loses track of them.\n\nLaney returns home, to find her father and Simon waiting up for her, and Zack is there waiting too. Laney explains how she fought off Dean's advances by deafening him with an [[Air horn#Portable or personal air horns|air horn]]. Zack confesses his true feelings to Laney, and asks for forgiveness as well as the chance to further their relationship, which she grants and the two officially become a couple. Laney tells Zack that she is considering art school after graduation, and Zack jokingly tells her that she has inspired him to pursue a career in performance art. After they dance and kiss, Laney asks Zack about the bet, and Zack responds that he will honor the terms.\n\nAt the graduation ceremony, it is revealed, that Zack must appear nude on stage. Zack is wearing only a graduation cap and strategically carrying a [[soccer ball]] to cover himself. Zack takes the stage, Laney catches the soccer ball and reacts with a smile, as the students applaud.\n\n== Cast ==\n{{Cast listing|\n* [[Freddie Prinze, Jr.]] as Zachary \"Zack\" Siler\n* [[Rachael Leigh Cook]] as Laney Boggs\n* [[Paul Walker]] as Dean Sampson, Jr.\n* [[Matthew Lillard]] as Brock Hudson\n* [[Jodi Lyn O'Keefe]] as Taylor Vaughan\n* [[Kevin Pollak]] as Wayne Boggs\n* [[Usher (entertainer)|Usher Raymond]] as Campus DJ\n* [[Lil' Kim|Kimberly \"Lil' Kim\" Jones]] as Alex Chason Sawyer\n* [[Anna Paquin]] as Mackenzie \"Mac\" Siler\n* [[Kieran Culkin]] as Simon Boggs\n* [[Elden Henson]] as Jesse Jackson\n* [[Sarah Michelle Gellar]] as Girl in Cafeteria (''uncredited'')<ref name=\"Greco\" /><ref name=\"Macatee\" />{{efn|Named in the credits under ''The Producers Wish To Thank'', subsection ''They're All That''.}}\n* [[Gabrielle Union]] as Katarina \"Katie\" Darlingson\n* [[Dul\u00e9 Hill]] as Preston\n* [[Tamara Mello]] as Chandler\n* [[Clea DuVall]] as Misty\n* [[Tim Matheson]] as Harlan Siler\n* [[Alexis Arquette]] as Mitch\n* [[Chris Owen (actor)|Chris Owen]] as Derek Funkhouser Rutley\n* [[Vanessa Lee Chester]] as Melissa's Friend\n* [[Milo Ventimiglia]] as Soccer Player\n* [[Takbir Bashir]] as Rapper\n* [[Brandon Mychal Smith]] as JV Cleaning Boy\n* [[Flex Alexander]] as Kadeem\n* [[Debbi Morgan]] as Laney's Art Teacher\n* [[Carlos Jacott]] as Prom Photographer\n* [[Michael Milhoan]] as Principal Stickley\n* [[Patricia Charbonneau]] as Lois Siler\n* Katharine Towne as Savannah\n}}\n\n== Production ==\n{{Anchor|Casting}}\nThe film had an impressive ensemble cast of up-and-coming actors, including Kieran Culkin, Oscar winner Anna Paquin, musician Usher Raymond, Gabrielle Union in her film debut, Dul\u00e9 Hill and [[Lil' Kim]].

During [[World War II]], he also served as Minister of Justice (October 1940 \u2013 October 1942) and Minister of Public Education (October 1942 \u2013 September 1944) in addition, as part of the [[Belgian government in exile]].

On June 15 the Belgian cabinet decided to continue the war in Britain but did not carry out its decision. Instead it followed the French government to Bordeaux. In a cabinet meeting on June 18, the three ministers expressed the desire to flee to London to continue the war: [[Camille Gutt]], Albert de Vleeschauwer and [[Marcel-Henri Jaspar]]. Jaspar left for London that very day, without the consent of his colleagues and was officially thrown out of the cabinet.\n\nOn 18 June 1940, the Belgian government issued a decree that gave de Vleeschauwer full legislative and executive power to manage the Congo as administrator-general.<ref name=\"Vanthemsche2012\">{{cite book|author=Guy Vanthemsche|title=Belgium and the Congo, 1885\u20131980|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ImNjdlBHzukC&pg=PA123|accessdate=10 August 2013|date=30 April 2012|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-19421-1|page=123}}</ref> The decree also stated that if the minister was unable to fulfill his office, that power would be passed on to the governor-general, [[Pierre Ryckmans (Governor-General)|Pierre Ryckmans]].

Vanlangenhove had refused to return to Brussels and had been given an unspecified mission by Spaak, with the rank of ambassador. On their arrival in Lisbon they send a telegram to all the heads of Belgian Diplomatic Missions and to the Governor-General of the Congo, announcing that a legally mandated member of the government was out of reach of the enemy and that their loyalty remained to the official government. On receipt of this message the Belgian ambassador in London, [[Emile de Cartier de Marchienne]], warned de Vleeschauwer that Jaspar, together with [[Camille Huysmans]], chairman of the Socialist International, was attempting to establish his own \"free\" government in London. De Vleeschauwer flew to London on July 4, where he was received by [[E. F. L. Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax|Lord Halifax]] (5 July) and by [[Winston Churchill]] (8 July) and offered them the full support of the Belgian Congo, provided they refuse to back Jaspar's initiative.

He succeeded in persuading Pierlot and Spaak. Gutt, already intending to leave and already with the required visa, accompanied de Vleeschauwer back to London, where they arrived on 8 August. Pierlot and Spaak returned to Vichy to convince their colleagues to resign. After succeeding at a last cabinet meeting (25 August), the two ministers left France on 27 August. They will reached London 22 October after escaping from their confinement in Barcelona. On 31 October, the four ministers held their first cabinet meeting in London.\n\nDe Vleeschauwer traveled to the Congo in December 1940, returning in March 1941. At this time the decision is taken to commit Congolese troops to the British [[East African Campaign (World War II)|campaign against the Italians in Abyssinia]]. They left Congo for the Sudan in March, from where they entered [[Ethiopian Empire|Abyssinia]] and took the towns of [[Asosa]] and Sa\u00efo in May. A medical unit also participated in the Madagascan landings and fighting in Burma. In May 1942 De Vleeschauwer made a second trip to Congo. The American government started its [[Manhattan project]] also in 1942 and conducted negotiations concerning the supply of uranium from the main Congolese mining company ''[[Union Mini\u00e8re du Haut Katanga]]''. These were only finalized on the day the Belgian government returned to Brussels on 8 September 1944.<ref name=\"J.E.Helmreich\">{{cite book|author=J. E.

When his party gained a majority in the elections of 1949, he entered the first [[Gaston Eyskens]] cabinet as Minister of the Interior. The succeeding government led by [[Jean Duvieusart]] failed in its attempt to restore the King to his throne and resigned after settling for an abdication in favour of his son [[Baudouin of Belgium|Baudouin]] (August 1950). De Vleeschauwer joins the government one last time (Eyskens  II) in June 1958. This cabinet granted independence to Congo in July 1960. The political turmoil that followed became fatal to De Vleeschauwer. A Belgian court case unexpectedly connected him to a [[Kinshasha|L\u00e9opoldville]] bankruptcy dating back to 1956. De Vleeschauwer resigned in November 1960 and had to wait till May 1964 before he was cleared of all the charges brought against him.\n\n== Honours ==\n* '''1947''' : Medal for Merit Awarded by President of the United States [[Medal for Merit]].\n* '''1949''' : Knight grand Cross in the [[Royal Order of the Lion]].<ref name=\"Odis\">{{cite web|url=http://www.odis.be/lnk/PS_3230|title=ODIS|website=www.odis.be}}</ref>\n* '''1954''' : Knight grand Cross in the [[Order of the Crown (Belgium)|Order of the Crown]].<ref name=\"Odis\" />\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{cite book|last1=Govaerts|first1=Bert|title=Ik alleen!

He was Minister of the Colonies from March 1938 to February 1945 (briefly interrupted in 1939). During [[World War II]], he also served as Minister of Justice (October 1940 \u2013 October 1942) and Minister of Public Education (October 1942 \u2013 September 1944) in addition, as part of the [[Belgian government in exile]]. After the war he served as Minister of the Interior from 1949\u201350 and Minister of Agriculture from 1958\u201360.\n\n==Early career==\nAlbert de Vleeschauwer joined the [[Belgian Army]] straight from school in 1916. After  the war he took both a law degree and a degree in philosophy  at the [[Catholic University of Leuven (1834\u20131968)|University of Louvain]]. He became a lawyer in 1924 and also joined the research department of the [[Boerenbond]], the Catholic Farmers' Union. In 1926 he became its head and in 1928 was appointed lecturer at the University\u2019s Agricultural Department. He served as chef de cabinet to Hendrik Baels, the Minister of Agriculture, in 1929\u20131930 and began his political career in 1932 when he was elected member of parliament for Leuven. He had an outspoken Christian democrat profile as one of the founders of the ''Katholieke Vlaamsche Volkspartij'' in 1936 .<ref name=\"Govaerts2012\">{{cite book|author=Bert Govaerts|title=Ik Alleen |publisher=Houteketiet|isbn=978-90-8924-209-9|page=122}}</ref> In May 1938 he joins [[Paul-Henri Spaak]]\u2019s tripartite coalition government, replacing his colleague Edmond Rubens after the latter\u2019s unexpected death.\n\n==Second World War==\nAfter the [[Battle of Belgium|German invasion of Belgium]] in May 1940, the most of the Belgian government fled to [[Paris]] and [[Limoges]] while the Colonial Ministry went straight to [[Bordeaux]]. On June 15 the Belgian cabinet decided to continue the war in Britain but did not carry out its decision. Instead it followed the French government to Bordeaux. In a cabinet meeting on June 18, the three ministers expressed the desire to flee to London to continue the war: [[Camille Gutt]], Albert de Vleeschauwer and [[Marcel-Henri Jaspar]]. Jaspar left for London that very day, without the consent of his colleagues and was officially thrown out of the cabinet.\n\nOn 18 June 1940, the Belgian government issued a decree that gave de Vleeschauwer full legislative and executive power to manage the Congo as administrator-general.<ref name=\"Vanthemsche2012\">{{cite book|author=Guy Vanthemsche|title=Belgium and the Congo, 1885\u20131980|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ImNjdlBHzukC&pg=PA123|accessdate=10 August 2013|date=30 April 2012|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-19421-1|page=123}}</ref> The decree also stated that if the minister was unable to fulfill his office, that power would be passed on to the governor-general, [[Pierre Ryckmans (Governor-General)|Pierre Ryckmans]].

Vanlangenhove had refused to return to Brussels and had been given an unspecified mission by Spaak, with the rank of ambassador. On their arrival in Lisbon they send a telegram to all the heads of Belgian Diplomatic Missions and to the Governor-General of the Congo, announcing that a legally mandated member of the government was out of reach of the enemy and that their loyalty remained to the official government. On receipt of this message the Belgian ambassador in London, [[Emile de Cartier de Marchienne]], warned de Vleeschauwer that Jaspar, together with [[Camille Huysmans]], chairman of the Socialist International, was attempting to establish his own \"free\" government in London. De Vleeschauwer flew to London on July 4, where he was received by [[E. F. L. Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax|Lord Halifax]] (5 July) and by [[Winston Churchill]] (8 July) and offered them the full support of the Belgian Congo, provided they refuse to back Jaspar's initiative.

Her mother named her Francine after a French musician. Her father, a farmworker, was an abusive alcoholic. Her mother, she later said, told her that \"you did what was best for your husband.\" At age 16, Francine left high school to marry James \"Mickey\" Hughes. They had four children.<ref name=\"wapo\"/> \n\n==Abuse== \nAlthough she had moved out after their divorce was finalized in April 1971,<ref name=\"burnbed\">{{Cite book|title=The Burning Bed|last=McNulty|first=Faith|publisher=Harcourt Brace Jovanovich|year=1980|isbn=0-15-114981-X|location=New York|pages=[https://archive.org/details/burningbed00mcnu/page/97 97]|quote=|via=|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/burningbed00mcnu/page/97}}</ref> Mickey had moved back in with her after he was involved in a serious car accident that summer.{{sfn|McNulty|1980|p=99-105}} Francine later testified in court that although she was reluctant to have him return to the home, she felt she could not refuse as she did not want to \"hurt him more...than he already had been\", referring to the severity of his injuries from the accident.{{sfn|McNulty|1980|p=244}} \n\nThe abuse persisted and escalated in the years after Mickey's recovery,{{sfn|McNulty|1980|p=244}} and he regularly beat her, destroyed furniture and killed his daughter's kitten.<ref name=\"wapo\"/> Francine felt that she could not remove Mickey from the home or move out herself, fearing that he would kill her.{{sfn|McNulty|1980|p=131}} She obtained her GED and, in 1976, enrolled in a secretarial course in an effort to retain some independence.{{sfn|McNulty|1980|p=131}}{{sfn|McNulty|1980|p=147}}\n\n==Crime and trial==\nOn the day of the fire, March 9, 1977, Francine returned from her secretarial course in the afternoon and found Mickey intoxicated and irate.{{sfn|McNulty|1980|p=164}} He refused to allow her to make food for their four children, and berated her for some time about quitting school, which she refused to agree to, even after Mickey forced her to burn her schoolbooks.{{sfn|McNulty|1980|p=168-9}} He began to physically assault her. The police came and spoke to the pair, but left after refusing to arrest Mickey as he had not assaulted her in front of them.{{sfn|McNulty|1980|p=171}} However, a police officer would later testify that Hughes had warned her that \"it was all over\" for her because she had called the police.<ref name=\"wapo\"/>\n\nFrancine again attempted to make dinner for herself and the children, but Mickey became irate and swept the food onto the floor. He forced Francine to the floor by bending her arm behind her back and made her clean the mess with her hands. When she was finished, he dumped out the trash can on the floor and forced her to clean it again.{{sfn|McNulty|1980|p=172}} Finally, he forced her to agree to quit secretarial school{{sfn|McNulty|1980|p=173}} and burn her textbooks.<ref name=\"wapo\"/>\n\nAfter he forced Francine to cook his dinner, he raped her. She suffered through this last assault until he finally fell into a drunken slumber.<ref>http://www-pub.naz.edu/~lyovano6/index.htm\n</ref> However, she decided to wait for her youngest child Dana to return home. When he did not return after some time, Francine decided to burn the house down to prevent her from returning to her life with Mickey again.{{sfn|McNulty|1980|p=176}} \n\nShe told the three children to put on their coats and wait in the car. She then poured [[gasoline]] around Mickey's bed and lit the gasoline. The resulting fire consumed the home. In the meantime, with her children in the car, Francine drove to the police station so she could confess to the killing.{{sfn|McNulty|1980|p=176-178}} \n\nAfter a trial in [[Lansing, Michigan]], Francine was found [[Insanity defense|not guilty by reason of temporary insanity]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE5D7133DF932A05751C1A96F948260&sec=&spon=&&scp=3|title= The Final Self-Defense|last=Carpenter|first=Teresa|date=December 31, 1989|work=[[The New York Times]]}}</ref> Both the prosecution and the defense agreed that Francine's plight was sympathetic.{{sfn|McNulty|1980|p=232}} However, no jurors have ever confirmed publicly whether that was a factor in their decision. The concept of [[jury nullification]] may apply here.\n\n==Later years==\nIn 1980, Hughes married Robert Wilson, a country musician,<ref name=\"wapo\" /> and became a nurse. She was an [[LPN]] and worked at several nursing homes. After retiring, she sat with the elderly and taught a nursing class. She died in [[Leighton, Alabama]], on March 22, 2017, from complications of pneumonia that she developed in late 2016.
