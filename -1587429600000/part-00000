He was subsequently selected with the 18th overall pick in the [[2010 NBA draft]] by the [[Oklahoma City Thunder]], but was traded to the [[Los Angeles Clippers]]. In his first season, he averaged 6.7 points and 3.6 assists and started 25 games. As a result, he was named to the [[NBA All-Rookie Second Team]]. In his second season, due to the Clippers' acquisition of [[Chris Paul]], he played only an average of 11 minutes per game, with only one start, and his stats dropped. In fact, during that season, he ended up being assigned to the Clippers' [[NBA Development League]] affiliate team, the [[Bakersfield Jam]]. However, during his third season, his statistics ended up rising in spite of still being behind Chris Paul for most of the games that he played. Bledsoe also participated in the 2013 All-Star Game's [[Slam Dunk Contest]].\n\n===Phoenix Suns (2013\u20132017)===\n\n====2013\u201314 season====\nOn July 10, 2013, Bledsoe was traded to the [[Phoenix Suns]] alongside teammate [[Caron Butler]] in a three-way trade with the L.A.

In his second game with the Suns, Bledsoe hit his first ever game-winning shot in an 87-84 home victory over the [[Utah Jazz]]. Before the November 19, 2013, game against the [[Sacramento Kings]], Bledsoe's shin collided with teammate [[P. J. Tucker]] during practice. He would miss six games before returning with 17 points, 6 rebounds, and 3 steals in a 112-101 victory against the Jazz on November 29, 2013. Bledsoe gained a career-high 28 points in a 116-107 victory against the [[Sacramento Kings]] on December 13, 2013. Bledsoe also got his first double-double with the Suns by scoring 16 points, grabbing 11 rebounds, and putting up 7 assists in a blowout 117-90 victory over the [[Los Angeles Lakers]] on December 23, 2013.\n\nDuring the third quarter of the Suns' last game of 2013 against the Clippers, Bledsoe injured his left shin. What began as a shin injury eventually turned into a meniscus injury that would leave him sidelined for nearly two and a half months. His injury was a leading factor in the Suns signing former player [[Leandro Barbosa]] back onto the team for the rest of that season. Bledsoe returned to action on March 12, 2014 against the [[Cleveland Cavaliers]].<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20131122034806/http://www.nba.com/games/20140312/CLEPHX/gameinfo.html Notebook: Cavaliers 110, Suns 101]</ref> He started for the Suns again and racked up 17 points and 10 rebounds two days later in an 87-80 victory against the [[Boston Celtics]].

He was subsequently selected with the 18th overall pick in the [[2010 NBA draft]] by the [[Oklahoma City Thunder]], but was traded to the [[Los Angeles Clippers]]. In his first season, he averaged 6.7 points and 3.6 assists and started 25 games. As a result, he was named to the [[NBA All-Rookie Second Team]]. In his second season, due to the Clippers' acquisition of [[Chris Paul]], he played only an average of 11 minutes per game, with only one start, and his stats dropped. In fact, during that season, he ended up being assigned to the Clippers' [[NBA Development League]] affiliate team, the [[Bakersfield Jam]]. However, during his third season, his statistics ended up rising in spite of still being behind Chris Paul for most of the games that he played. Bledsoe also participated in the 2013 All-Star Game's [[Slam Dunk Contest]].\n\n===Phoenix Suns (2013\u20132017)===\n\n====2013\u201314 season====\nOn July 10, 2013, Bledsoe was traded to the [[Phoenix Suns]] alongside teammate [[Caron Butler]] in a three-way trade with the L.A.

In his second game with the Suns, Bledsoe hit his first ever game-winning shot in an 87-84 home victory over the [[Utah Jazz]]. Before the November 19, 2013, game against the [[Sacramento Kings]], Bledsoe's shin collided with teammate [[P. J. Tucker]] during practice. He would miss six games before returning with 17 points, 6 rebounds, and 3 steals in a 112-101 victory against the Jazz on November 29, 2013. Bledsoe gained a career-high 28 points in a 116-107 victory against the [[Sacramento Kings]] on December 13, 2013. Bledsoe also got his first double-double with the Suns by scoring 16 points, grabbing 11 rebounds, and putting up 7 assists in a blowout 117-90 victory over the [[Los Angeles Lakers]] on December 23, 2013.\n\nDuring the third quarter of the Suns' last game of 2013 against the Clippers, Bledsoe injured his left shin. What began as a shin injury eventually turned into a meniscus injury that would leave him sidelined for nearly two and a half months.

Unfortunately, since head writers [[Christopher Whitesell]] and [[Gary Tomlin]] were replaced by Josh Griffith and Dena Higley, with their material starting to air in mid-August, Paul has appeared only a handful of times, and the frontburner storyline involving him, Sonny, Will and Derrick was axed by the new regime, which involved the killing of the gay legacy character Will, which led to a huge backlash from fans right before the show's 50th anniversary.<small>[Citation needed:July 2019]</small>\n|-\n|[[List of Spartacus (TV series) characters#Nasir|Nasir]] || [[Pana Hema Taylor]] || ''[[Spartacus (TV series)|Spartacus]]'' ||<small>[Citation needed:July 2019]</small>\n|-\n|Neil || ____ || ''[[Days of Our Lives]]'' ||<small>[Citation needed:July 2019]</small>\n|-\n|[[Steve Newlin]] || [[Michael McMillian]] || ''[[True Blood]]'' ||<small>[Citation needed:July 2019]</small>\n|-\n|[[Smashie and Nicey|Dave Nice]] || [[Harry Enfield]] || ''[[Harry Enfield's Television Programme]]'' || <ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2010/oct/09/harry-enfield-paul-whitehouse 'We're like Preston and Chantelle!'

In season 4, while trying to identify murder victim Mariana Wallace, Rusty meets her brother Gustavo \"Gus\" Wallace who becomes romantically interested in him. After initially resisting Gus' advances due to distance and his fears of Gus no longer liking him if they date, Rusty enters into a relationship with Gus. Despite this, Rusty is shown to be uncomfortable with being gay, shying away from holding Gus' hand in public which causes them some problems. In \"Off the Wagon\", Rusty tells Gus he loves him for the first time and intends to spend his life with Gus, something that Gus reciprocates.<small>[Citation needed:July 2019]</small>\n|-\n|Ben || [[Bradley Cooper]] <br> [[Adam Scott (actor)|Adam Scott]] || ''[[Wet Hot American Summer: First Day of Camp]]'' <br> ''[[Wet Hot American Summer: Ten Years Later]]'' || <small>[Citation needed:July 2019]</small>\n|-\n|Jack Benjamin || [[Sebastian Stan]] || ''[[Kings (U.S. TV series)|Kings]]'' ||<small>[Citation needed:July 2019]</small>\n|-\n|Dr. Oliver Berg || Laurence Penry-Jones || ''[[Doctors (2000 TV series)|Doctors]]'' ||<small>[Citation needed:July 2019]</small>\n|-\n|Sol Bergstein || [[Sam Waterston]] || ''[[Grace and Frankie]]'' ||<small>[Citation needed:July 2019]</small>\n|-\n|Henry Best || [[Vincent Franklin]] || ''[[Cucumber (TV series)|Cucumber]]'' <br> ''[[Banana (TV series)|Banana]]'' ||<small>[Citation needed:July 2019]</small>\n|-\n|Ida Best || [[Bob the Drag Queen|Caldwell Tidicue]] || ''[[Tales of the City (2019 miniseries)|Tales of the City]]'' || Ida is a drag queen. <small>[Citation needed:July 2019]</small>\n|-\n|[[Marco Bianco (EastEnders)|Marco Bianco]] || [[Bart Ruspoli]] || ''[[EastEnders]]'' ||<small>[Citation needed:July 2019]</small>\n|-\n|Erol Birkan || [[Fahri Yard\u0131m]] || ''[[Dogs of Berlin (TV series)|Dogs of Berlin]]'' ||  <small>[Citation needed:July 2019]</small>\n|-\n|Kyle Bishop || [[Andy Mientus]] || ''[[Smash (U.S. TV series)|Smash]]'' ||<small>[Citation needed:July 2019]</small>\n|-\n|Stuart Bixby || [[Derek Jacobi]] || ''[[Vicious (TV series)|Vicious]]'' || Stuart and Freddie Thornhill have been together for almost 50 years.<ref name=Viciousweta>{{cite web|last1=Baugher|first1=Lacy|title='Vicious' Finale Special to Air This Summer on PBS|url=https://blogs.weta.org/tellyvisions/2016/05/18/vicious-finale-special-air-summer-pbs|website=[[WETA-TV]]|date=May 18, 2016}}</ref>\n|-\n|Eric Black || ____ || ''[[Judging Amy]]'' ||<small>[Citation needed:July 2019]</small>\n|-\n|Billie Blaikie || [[Alan Cumming]] || ''[[The L Word]]'' ||<small>[Citation needed:July 2019]</small>\n|-\n|Larry Blaisdell || ____ || ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'' ||<small>[Citation needed:July 2019]</small>\n|-\n|Richie Blake || [[Spencer McLaren]] || ''[[The Secret Life of Us]]'' ||<small>[Citation needed:July 2019]</small>\n|-\n|Helen Blakemore || ____ || ''[[Water Rats (TV series)|Water Rats]]'' ||<small>[Citation needed:July 2019]</small>\n|-\n|Stanford Blatch || [[Willie Garson]] || ''[[Sex and the City]]'' ||<small>[Citation needed:July 2019]</small>\n|-\n|[[Max Blum]] || [[Adam Pally]] || ''[[Happy Endings (TV series)|Happy Endings]]'' || He had an important relationship with Grant during the series.<small>[Citation needed:July 2019]</small>\n|-\n|Dr. Simon Bond || [[David Sturzaker]] || ''[[Doctors (2000 TV series)|Doctors]]'' ||<small>[Citation needed:July 2019]</small>\n|-\n|Brad Bottig || Brock Ciarlelli || ''[[The Middle (TV series)|The Middle]]'' || Hinted heavily that he was gay during season 1-6.

Unfortunately, since head writers [[Christopher Whitesell]] and [[Gary Tomlin]] were replaced by Josh Griffith and Dena Higley, with their material starting to air in mid-August, Paul has appeared only a handful of times, and the frontburner storyline involving him, Sonny, Will and Derrick was axed by the new regime, which involved the killing of the gay legacy character Will, which led to a huge backlash from fans right before the show's 50th anniversary.<small>[Citation needed:July 2019]</small>\n|-\n|[[List of Spartacus (TV series) characters#Nasir|Nasir]] || [[Pana Hema Taylor]] || ''[[Spartacus (TV series)|Spartacus]]'' ||<small>[Citation needed:July 2019]</small>\n|-\n|Neil || ____ || ''[[Days of Our Lives]]'' ||<small>[Citation needed:July 2019]</small>\n|-\n|[[Steve Newlin]] || [[Michael McMillian]] || ''[[True Blood]]'' ||<small>[Citation needed:July 2019]</small>\n|-\n|[[Smashie and Nicey|Dave Nice]] || [[Harry Enfield]] || ''[[Harry Enfield's Television Programme]]'' || <ref>[https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2010/oct/09/harry-enfield-paul-whitehouse 'We're like Preston and Chantelle!'

He is currently the men's basketball coach at [[Purdue University]], having held that position since 2005. Before Purdue, Painter held coaching positions at Southern Illinois, Eastern Illinois, Barton College, and Washington & Jefferson College.\n\nPainter runs a motion offense that has consistently been one of the top five offenses in recent years.\n\nPainter's teams are also known for their \"stout, stingy, defense\" and their \"overwhelming offense\". Since 2016, Painter's teams have ranked 19th, 24th, 2nd, and 4th in offensive efficiency. Additionally, 7 of Painter's teams have ranked in the top 35 in defensive efficiency.\n\nWith Painter at the helm, Purdue teams have reached the NCAA Tournament eleven times, with five Sweet Sixteen appearances and one Elite Eight appearance. Painter also reached the NCAA Tournament in his one season at Southern Illinois, giving him a total of twelve tournament appearances in only fifteen years coaching.\n\nMatt Painter has coached a total of nine NBA players in his tenure at Purdue University.\n\n==Playing career==\nMatt Painter was born in [[Fort Wayne, Indiana]], and attended [[Delta High School (Muncie, Indiana)|Delta High School]], about 60 miles south in [[Muncie, Indiana]]. He played basketball for former basketball coach and athletic director, Stan Daugherty. He attended [[Purdue University]] as an undergraduate. He played four seasons as a [[Purdue Boilermakers|Boilermakers]] [[point guard]] under head coach [[Gene Keady]] and assistants [[Bruce Weber (basketball)|Bruce Weber]], and [[Steve Lavin]]. He helped lead the Boilermakers to three [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA Tournaments]] and one [[National Invitation Tournament|NIT]] appearance. He was teammates with [[Jimmy Oliver]], [[Steve Scheffler]] and [[Glenn Robinson]]. He started 50 of the 109 games in which he appeared and helped his team to a 75-45 overall record. In his senior season, he was selected as a team captain and was named an All-[[Big Ten Conference|Big Ten]] Honorable Mention. Painter finished his career averaging 4.5 points-per-game and totaling 276 assists.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! College !!

In the 1994-95 season, Barton finished with 13 wins and 13 losses.  Painter then moved to [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] as an assistant coach at [[Eastern Illinois Panthers|Eastern Illinois]] of the [[Ohio Valley Conference]], where he also received his master's degree.\n\n===Southern Illinois===\nAfter three years at Eastern Illinois, he moved to [[Southern Illinois Salukis men's basketball|Southern Illinois]] in 1998 as an assistant to head coach [[Bruce Weber (coach)|Bruce Weber]]. Painter was previously acquainted with him while Weber was an assistant coach at Purdue during Painter's playing days. Weber and Painter quickly turned a team that had a losing record the previous season into a successful team. Painter helped lead the Salukis to the [[National Invitational Tournament|NIT]] in 2000 and twice to the NCAA Tournament the following seasons while an assistant coach. In the 2001\u201302 season, they qualified for the [[2002 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|NCAA Tournament]] and ended their season in the Sweet Sixteen with a loss to [[Connecticut Huskies men's basketball|UConn]]. That year, SIU beat well-established programs such as [[Georgia Bulldogs men's basketball|Georgia]] and [[Texas Tech Red Raiders men's basketball|Texas Tech]]. In 2003, Weber's and Painter's Salukis were featured on [[Music Television|MTV]]'s special ''True Life: I Am a College Baller''.\n\nAfter serving as an assistant coach for five seasons at SIU, Matt Painter stepped into his first [[NCAA Division I]] head coaching position after Bruce Weber took the head coaching job at [[Illinois Fighting Illini men's basketball|Illinois]] for the 2003\u201304 season. Leading the Salukis to a 25\u20135 record and a berth in the [[2004 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|2004 NCAA Tournament]], the team was ranked as high as #15 in the nation by the [[AP poll]] during the season. Painter was named the 2003-2004 [[Missouri Valley Conference]] Coach of the Year.\n\n===Purdue===\n====2004\u201305 season====\nIn 2004, Painter was recruited by Purdue as the replacement for retiring head coach [[Gene Keady]]. He signed a six-year contract as the new [[Purdue Boilermakers men's basketball]] coach. As part of a planned transition, Painter was named the associate head coach for the 2004\u201305 season. He joined former teammate [[Cuonzo Martin]] (now head coach at [[Missouri Tigers men's basketball|University of Missouri]]) on the coaching staff. With key players out with injuries, suspensions and transfers, Purdue finished the season with a 7\u201321 record, the most losses in the program's history in a season.\n\n====2005\u201306 season====\nAt the start of the 2005\u201306 season, Painter took over for Keady as the head coach at his [[alma mater]] and became the second former Purdue player to become the head coach since Ray Eddy (1950\u20131965). In his first season in that role, despite the absences of injured starters, [[David Teague (basketball)|David Teague]] and [[Carl Landry]], and only playing with seven scholarship players, they finished with a 9-19 record. Painter's first Purdue squad as a head coach came up with wins against eventual NCAA Tournament qualifier [[Wisconsin Badgers men's basketball|Wisconsin]] and #23 [[Michigan Wolverines men's basketball|Michigan]].\n\n====2006\u201307 season====\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:painter .jpg|thumb|right|300px|An animated Painter at head coach at Purdue]] -->\nIn his second season as head coach, the team had high hopes for an NCAA berth. Both [[power forward (basketball)|power forward]] [[Carl Landry]] and [[shooting guard]] [[David Teague (basketball)|David Teague]] returned to the lineup after injuries, combining an average of about 34 points and 15 rebounds per game. Painter's Boilermakers finished the non-conference season with an 11-3 record, which included wins over previously unbeaten and top 25 schools [[Virginia Cavaliers men's basketball|Virginia]] and [[Missouri Tigers men's basketball|Missouri]]. They headed deep into the regular season without a road win. The team had also not won a road game in the two prior seasons during which Painter was part of the Boilermaker's bench. That 29 road-game losing streak ended on February 3, 2007, when Purdue beat [[Penn State Nittany Lions men's basketball|Penn State]] at the [[Bryce Jordan Center]]. After winning seven of their last ten conference games during the regular season and setting a single-season school record for most home wins at 16 in [[Mackey Arena]], Painter and his Boilermakers finished the regular season with a 9-7 conference record. They received a 5th seed in the Big Ten Tournament and were knocked out in the semifinals when they lost to a [[Greg Oden]]-led [[Ohio State Buckeyes men's basketball|Ohio State]] team. Purdue was invited to the [[2007 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|2007 NCAA Tournament]], Painter's second appearance as a head coach, and received a 9 seed. The team's opening round opponent was [[Lute Olson]]'s [[Arizona Wildcats men's basketball|Arizona]]. After beating the Wildcats, Purdue fell to [[Billy Donovan]]'s number one seeded and defending/eventual national champions, [[Florida Gators men's basketball|Florida]]. With +13 wins from the previous season, it was the biggest win-margin turnaround in the program's history.\n\n====2007\u201308 season====\nComing off one of the program's biggest single season improvements, Painter returned only one senior on the roster with 6 newcomers. Painter achieved notable recruiting success, signing one of the top five recruiting classes in the nation for 2007, all coming from the state of Indiana. Painter started at least three freshmen in every game at the start of the '07-'08 season, making it the youngest starting line-up in the nation. His \"[[baby boilers]]\" finished the non-conference season with a 9-4 record, which included a win against [[Rick Pitino]]'s #22 ranked [[Louisville Cardinals men's basketball|Louisville]], as well as a loss to [[Wofford College|Wofford]], their only home loss of the season. During an eleven-game winning streak in conference play, they swept the season series with the conference champion #8 Wisconsin and had a home win against #9 [[Michigan State Spartans men's basketball|Michigan State]]. It was the first back-to-back wins versus top ten teams in school history. Their winning streak was ended when they lost to in-state rival, #14 [[Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball|Indiana]]. Painter and his Boilers finished the regular season in 2nd place with a 15-3 record.  During the regular season and into the conference tournament, Purdue was ranked as high as #15 in both polls. Painter's team entered the Big Ten Tournament with the #2 seed. They lost in the quarterfinals to the 10th seeded Illinois. They were invited to the [[2008 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|2008 NCAA Tournament]] and given a #6 seed. They beat [[Baylor Bears men's basketball|Baylor]] in the first round, giving Purdue its 10th straight first round win in the tournament. They lost in the second round to a senior-led [[Xavier Musketeers men's basketball|Xavier]] team. Matt was eventually named the [[Big Ten Conference Men's Basketball Coach of the Year|Big Ten Conference Coach of the Year]]. The Boilers finished the season with a 25-9 record.\n\n====2008\u201309 season====\nPainter's Boilermakers began the [[2008-09 Purdue Boilermakers men's basketball team|2008-2009]] season with an [[ESPN]]/[[USA Today]] Poll rank at #10 and an [[AP Top 25]] #11 ranking. They had five returning starters from the prior season, including [[Chris Kramer]], the conference's defensive player of the year and two all-conference selections in [[E'Twaun Moore]] and [[Robbie Hummel]]. Painter's Boilers opened the season with a 5\u20130 record. In the first game of the season, his team set the school record for fewest turnovers in a game, only committing three, against [[University of Detroit Mercy|Detroit]] on November 14, 2008. With a #9 ranking, Purdue had their first losses of the season back-to-back in overtime to #13 ranked [[Oklahoma Sooners men's basketball|Oklahoma]] in the [[NIT Season Tip-Off]] championship game and a 16-point home loss against #4 [[Duke Blue Devils men's basketball|Duke]]. They finished the pre-season with an 11-2 record, which included a win against #22 [[Davidson Wildcats men's basketball|Davidson]]. Purdue finished third in conference play, including a season-sweep by Illinois and splitting the season meetings with conference title winners, Michigan State. Near the end of the regular season, Matt was selected as one of ten candidates for the [[Henry Iba Award]], which goes to the nation's best coach of the year. With a much healthier Robbie Hummel in the lineup, they entered the [[2009 Big Ten Conference Men's Basketball Tournament|Big Ten Tournament]] with the #3 seed, beating Ohio State in the finals, giving Purdue its first conference tournament championship in school history. Throughout the tournament, Painter's team averaged 16 assists and less than six turnovers in three games. Matt Painter led his team to a third straight [[2009 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|NCAA Tournament]] appearance with a #5 seed, the team's highest seed in 10 years. They beat [[Northern Iowa]] from the [[Missouri Valley Conference|MVC]] in the first round, becoming the program's 11th straight first round win dating back to 1994. After beating [[Washington Huskies men's basketball|Washington]] in the Second Round, Purdue reached their first [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|Sweet Sixteen]] in 9 years, eventually losing to [[Jim Calhoun]]'s [[Hasheem Thabeet]]-led [[Connecticut Huskies men's basketball|UConn]]. Painter's team finished the season with a 27\u201310 record, the most games played in a season in its program's history. Despite beginning his Purdue head coaching position coming off a prior 7-win season, Matt surpassed Gene Keady's first four season's (1981\u20131985) win total of 82 in his first four (2005\u20132009) with 83 victories.\n\n=====U19 USA Championships Team=====\nOn May 12, 2009, Matt Painter accepted an assistant coach position for the 2009 USA Basketball U19 World Championships team. Along with current head coach and former fellow assistant, [[Chris Lowery]], at [[Southern Illinois Salukis men's basketball|Southern Illinois]], he served under [[Pittsburgh Panthers men's basketball|Pittsburgh]] head coach, [[Jamie Dixon]]. Painter helped lead the team to a 9-0 record with a 22.2 point win margin, while winning the gold after beating [[Greece]].\n\n====2009\u201310 season====\n[[File:Matt Painter Purdue.jpg|thumb|right|Painter coaching on the sideline]]\nMatt Painter and his team began the [[2009\u201310 Purdue Boilermakers men's basketball team|2009\u201310]] season with a 14\u20130 record, which tied the [[1993\u201394 Boilermakers men's basketball team|1993\u201394 team]] for the best start in the program's history. He returned his entire regular starting five, including three all-conference selections in [[JaJuan Johnson]], E'Twaun Moore, and Robbie Hummel. Painter started his fifth season at Purdue with his team receiving a preseason 7th overall ranking by both the Associated Press and Coaches Polls, the program's highest in 22 years. Coach Painter led his top ten ranked team to the 2009 [[Paradise Jam Tournament]] championship against [[Bruce Pearl]]'s #10 [[Tennessee Volunteers men's basketball|Tennessee]], followed by the preseason close with a home win over #6 [[West Virginia Mountaineers men's basketball|West Virginia]] and a 12-0 record against non-conference opponents. On January 28, 2010, Matt won his 100th game as Purdue's head coach against [[Wisconsin Badgers men's basketball|Wisconsin]], becoming the fourth fastest to reach the mark behind former Purdue coaches [[Ward Lambert]], [[George King (basketball, born 1928)|George King]], and [[Gene Keady]]. Deep into the regular conference season, Matt Painter got his first career road wins against #10 [[Michigan State Spartans men's basketball|Michigan State]] in [[East Lansing, Michigan|East Lansing]] and #9 [[Ohio State Buckeyes men's basketball|Ohio State]] in [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]], leaving Purdue as the only team in the nation to go 4\u20130 against top ten teams. With a ten-game winning streak in conference play, Purdue received a #3 ranking in both polls, giving Painter his highest ranking as both a player and head coach, while being the program's highest in sixteen years. After losing All-Conference starter Robbie Hummel to an [[Anterior cruciate ligament|ACL]] injury, Painter pushed his junior/senior-led team in the last three conference games (2\u20131), culminating with a 14\u20134 conference record and a share of the Big Ten title, the program's first in fourteen years. At the end of the regular season, Matt Painter was named the coaches' pick for [[Big Ten Conference Men's Basketball Coach of the Year|Big Ten Conference Coach of the Year]], his second time being honored with the title since arriving at Purdue. After beating [[Siena Saints men's basketball|Siena]] in the First Round of the [[2010 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|NCAA Tournament]] and [[Texas A&M]] in the Second Round with a 4 seed, Painter has led Purdue to consecutive Sweet Sixteen appearances and currently has an overall 6-4 record in NCAA Tournament games after losing to Duke. Finishing with a 29\u20136 record, it tied for most wins in a season in school history.\n\n====2010\u201311 season====\nComing off the most wins in a four-year span in school history with 102 (2007\u20132010), Matt Painter and his Boiler squad returned two All-American candidates (JaJuan Johnson, E'Twaun Moore), its primary point guard ([[Lewis Jackson (basketball player)|Lewis Jackson]]), and an All-Conference freshman (Kelsey Barlow). ESPN's [[Andy Katz]] selected Purdue as the preseason No. 1-ranked team for the [[2010-11 Purdue Boilermakers men's basketball team|2011]] season, while [[Fox Sports (USA)|Fox Sports]] selected them as the No. 4 favorite.<ref>http://msn.foxsports.com/cbk/gallery/Goodman-Your-2010-11-NCAA--top-25#sport=CBK&photo=11110047</ref> These predictions came premature as fellow All-American candidate, Robbie Hummel, re-tore his ACL during practice, preventing him from playing his senior season. Joining the sidelines was Painter's latest addition to his bench staff, Mike Jackson, a former [[Michigan Wolverines men's basketball|Michigan]] assistant coach. In preseason play, Painter's team began the season ranked as high as eighth in the nation and fell as low as 22nd following a loss to [[2011\u201312 Richmond Spiders men's basketball team|Richmond]] in the [[Chicago Invitational Challenge|Chicago Invitational]] finals. Painter's Boilers went undefeated at home on the season for the first time in 42 years (16\u20130). They tied series with ranked [[2011\u201312 Wisconsin Badgers men's basketball team|Wisconsin]], [[Minnesota Golden Gophers men's basketball|Minnesota]], and the top-ranked team in the nation, [[2011\u201312 Ohio State Buckeyes men's basketball team|Ohio State]]. No. 6 Purdue finished second in the [[2010\u201311 Big Ten Conference men's basketball season|Big Ten Conference]] with a 14\u20134 record, while finishing the regular season 26\u20138 overall. At the conclusion of the regular season, Painter was named [[Big Ten Conference Men's Basketball Coach of the Year|Big Ten Conference Coach of the Year]] for the third time in four seasons. Painter received his highest [[2011 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|NCAA Tournament]] seeding as a coach, with No. 13-ranked Purdue being named a No. 3 seed in the Tournament. They defeated [[2010\u201311 Saint Peter's Peacocks basketball team|Saint Peter's]] in the First Round, but were upset by Final Four-bound No. 11 seed [[2010\u201311 VCU Rams men's basketball team|VCU]] the Second Round.\n\n=====Connection to Missouri vacancy=====\nOn March 30, 2011, it was reported that Painter might accept the [[Missouri Tigers men's basketball|University of Missouri]] head coaching position. However, after the initial reports surfaced, Purdue announced that Painter had accepted a new eight-year deal to remain with the school.<ref name=\"Purdue, Painter Agree To New Eight-Year Contract\">{{cite web | url=http://www.purduesports.com/sports/m-baskbl/spec-rel/033011aab.html | title=Painter signs new deal | accessdate=March 30, 2011}}</ref>\n\n====2011\u201312 season====\nAfter losing All-American seniors in JaJuan Johnson and E'Twaun Moore to graduation and the [[NBA]], Painter returned a handful of experienced role players and Preseason First Team All-Big Ten forward Robbie Hummel, who returned from a second ACL injury. His Boiler squad began the [[2011-12 Purdue Boilermakers men's basketball team|2012]] season unranked for the first time in four seasons. Joining him on the bench were two new assistant coaches in [[Micah Shrewsberry]], who was part of the coaching staff that guided [[Butler Bulldogs men's basketball|Butler]] to consecutive NCAA Finals, and [[Greg Gary (basketball)|Greg Gary]], who previously assisted at [[Duquesne Dukes men's basketball|Duquesne]], [[South Florida Bulls men's basketball|South Florida]], [[Miami Hurricanes men's basketball|Miami]], and [[Tulane Green Wave men's basketball|Tulane]]. On November 11, Painter's squad opened the season beating [[Northern Illinois Huskies|Northern Illinois]] by 62 points, the program's highest win margin since 1911. Painter's team received its first loss of the season against No. 15-ranked [[Alabama Crimson Tide men's basketball|Alabama]] in the [[Puerto Rico Tip-Off]] title game. Their second loss of the season came on the road against No. 11-ranked [[2011\u201312 Xavier Musketeers men's basketball team|Xavier]], a game where Painter's squad forced a season-high 22 turnovers and was up by 19 points in the second half. On December 17 at [[Conseco Fieldhouse]], his team was upset by [[2011\u201312 Butler Bulldogs men's basketball team|Butler]] after losing a 15-point lead, losing by two. Closing the preseason with a 10\u20133 record and a 3\u20132 start in conference play, Purdue owned the fifth longest home winning streak in the nation at 27 before losing to [[2011\u201312 Wisconsin Badgers men's basketball team|Wisconsin]]. Against [[2011\u201312 Illinois Fighting Illini men's basketball team|Illinois]] on New Year's Eve, Painter received his 150th win at Purdue and his 175th career win as a head coach. Three times in conference play, Painter's squad committed a school-record three turnovers in a game, losing all three, which included a three-point loss in a road game against No. 3 [[2011\u201312 Ohio State Buckeyes men's basketball team|Ohio State]]. Painter got his first win against a ranked team on the season beating No. 11 [[2011\u201312 Michigan Wolverines men's basketball team|Michigan]] on the road by 14 points, giving Michigan their only home loss on the season. His squad led the nation in fewest turnovers, committing just 8.9 per game (7.6 in conference play) while averaging a \u20134.6 turnover margin against opponents. With the 20th win on the season against [[2011\u201312 Penn State Nittany Lions basketball team|Penn State]] on February 29, Painter gave Purdue its sixth consecutive 20-win season, tying a program record with Gene Keady's mid-1980s mark. Purdue ended the [[2011\u201312 Big Ten Conference men's basketball season|Big Ten season]] at 10\u20138 in conference play (sixth) and stood at 21\u201312 overall after the [[2012 Big Ten Conference Men's Basketball Tournament|Big Ten Tournament]]. On March 11, the Boilermakers received an at-large bid as the No. 10 seed in the Midwest region of the [[2012 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|NCAA Tournament]]. In the first round of the Tournament, Purdue beat No. 7 seed [[2011\u201312 Saint Mary's Gaels men's basketball team|Saint Mary's]] 72\u201369, their 14th straight First Round victory, the longest current streak at that time. In the Second Round, Purdue lost to No. 2 [[2011\u201312 Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball team|Kansas]] 63\u201360. Purdue ended the season 22\u201313, their sixth straight year with 22 or more wins.\n\n====2012\u201313 season====\nPainter began the [[2012-13 Purdue Boilermakers men's basketball team|2013]] season after losing three senior starters from the previous season including All-American [[Robbie Hummel]] and point guard [[Lewis Jackson (basketball, born 1989)|Lewis Jackson]]. Also leaving the program were would-be seniors in shooting guard John Hart (transferred to [[IUPUI Jaguars men's basketball|IUPUI]]) and suspended guard/forward Kelsey Barlow (transferred to [[UIC Flames men's basketball|UIC]]). Painter's raw and young squad began the season with a 2\u20133 record, losing their season opener for the first time during the Painter-era. Purdue went on to lose games to [[2012\u201313 Villanova Wildcats men's basketball team|Villanova]] and [[2012\u201313 Oregon State Beavers men's basketball team|Oregon State]] at [[Madison Square Garden]] in the [[2K Sports Classic]]. The Boilers finished 7\u20136 in non-conference play. In [[2012\u201313 Big Ten Conference men's basketball season|Big Ten play]], Painter consistently started at least three freshmen, which included a B1G-All Freshman [[A. J. Hammons]] and Ronnie Johnson. Painter's squad made improvement towards the end of the season, after going through much inconsistency, getting wins at No. 7 [[2012\u201313 Wisconsin Badgers men's basketball team|Wisconsin]], a near upset against of No. 7 [[2012\u201313 Michigan Wolverines men's basketball team|Michigan]], and a blowout win against Minnesota, Painter's 200th career win. Finishing seventh in conference play with an 8\u201310 record, Purdue lost to [[2012\u201313 Nebraska Cornhuskers men's basketball team|Nebraska]] in the first round of the [[2013 Big Ten Conference Men's Basketball Tournament|Big Ten Tournament]]. Purdue accepted a bid to the [[2013 College Basketball Invitational|CBI]], where they defeated [[Western Illinois]] before losing to [[Santa Clara Broncos|Santa Clara]] and finishing with a 16\u201318 overall record.\n\n====2013\u201314 season====\nIn his [[2013\u201314 Purdue Boilermakers men's basketball team|ninth season]] at Purdue, the Boilermakers started well, finishing the non-conference slate at 10\u20133.  However, the Boilers struggled in [[2013\u201314 Big Ten Conference men's basketball season|Big Ten play]] despite winning three of their first five games in conference. The Boilers would lose 11 of their last 13 regular season games to finish last in the league with a 5\u201313 record. A loss in the first round of the [[2014 Big Ten Conference Men's Basketball Tournament|Big Ten Tournament]] to No. 24 [[2013\u201314 Ohio State Buckeyes men's basketball team|Ohio State]] left Purdue with a 15\u201317 overall record and without a postseason.\n\n====2014\u201315 season====\nIn his 10th season as Purdue's head coach, Painter brought in three contributing freshman, including the tallest player in the program's history, 7'2\" Isaac Haas.  With an 8\u20135 non-conference record that included a blowout loss to a ranked [[2014\u201315 Notre Dame Fighting Irish men's basketball team|Notre Dame]] and home losses to [[2014\u201315 North Florida Ospreys men's basketball team|North Florida]] and [[2014\u201315 Gardner\u2013Webb Runnin' Bulldogs men's basketball team|Gardner Webb]], Painter was viewed by many as being on the hot seat. With the play of juniors A. J. Hammons and Rapheal Davis and the additional lift of transfer senior point guard John Octeus, [[2014\u201315 Purdue Boilermakers men's basketball team|Painter's squad]] turned things around in conference play. They finished third in conference with a 12\u20136 record after being predicted to finish near the bottom of the league. They defeated three ranked teams in a four-game stretch with home wins against No. 25 [[2014\u201315 Iowa Hawkeyes men's basketball team|Iowa]], No. 20 [[2014\u201315 Ohio State Buckeyes men's basketball team|Ohio State]], and No. 21 [[2014\u201315 Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball team|Indiana]]. During this time, Painter received his 100th Big Ten win and reached a personal 9\u20138 winning record against in-state rivals Indiana with a season sweep. A loss in the semifinals of the [[2015 Big Ten Conference Men's Basketball Tournament|Big Ten Tournament]] to No. 6 [[2014\u201315 Wisconsin Badgers men's basketball team|Wisconsin]] preceded an at-large bid to the [[2015 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|NCAA Tournament]]. The trip marked Painter's eighth appearance as a head coach. The No. 9-seeded Boilers would fall in overtime to the No. 8-seeded [[2014\u201315 Cincinnati Bearcats men's basketball team|Cincinnati]] in the First Round. They finished with a 21\u201313 overall record on the season.\n\n====2015\u201316 season====\nPainter accomplished a first in his coaching career by landing a five-star recruit in 2015 [[Indiana Mr. Basketball]] [[Caleb Swanigan]], who switched his commitment from Michigan State to Purdue. Painter led the [[2015\u201316 Purdue Boilermakers men's basketball team|team]] to a 26\u20139 overall record. The team maintained an AP Top 25 ranking throughout their entire season, but showed inconsistency. The team boasted victories over conference heavyweights [[2015\u201316 Michigan State Spartans men's basketball team|Michigan State]], [[2015\u201316 Maryland Terrapins men's basketball team|Maryland]], and [[2015\u201316 Wisconsin Badgers men's basketball team|Wisconsin]]. In the Big Ten Tournament, the fell four points shy of the championship losing to Michigan State. The team's inconsistency continued as they fell to 12-seeded [[2015\u201316 Little Rock Trojans men's basketball team|Arkansas-Little Rock]] in the First Round of the [[2017 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|NCAA Tournament]].\n\nSenior center [[A. J. Hammons]] was selected as a finalist for the [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar Award]] for best center, and was selected as Big Ten Defensive Player of the Year, succeeding Purdue teammate and 2015 recipient Raphael Davis.\n\n==== 2016\u201317 season ====\n[[2016\u201317 Purdue Boilermakers men's basketball team|Purdue]] was ranked in the top-25 throughout the entire season, the second consecutive season to boast that accomplishment. They won their 23rd [[2016\u201317 Big Ten Conference men's basketball season|Big Ten Conference]] regular season championship and first outright title in 21 years (1996) by finishing the season with a 25\u20136 record, 14\u20134 in conference. This was the Boilermakers best record and first conference championship since [[2009\u201310 Purdue Boilermakers men's basketball team|2010]]. They ended the year by winning 10 out of their last 12 games. Sophomore forward [[Caleb Swanigan]] was named [[Big Ten Conference Men's Basketball Player of the Year|Big Ten Player of the Year]] in a unanimous vote, the first Purdue player to win that award since [[JaJuan Johnson]]. They lost in their first game in the [[2017 Big Ten Conference Men's Basketball Tournament|Big Ten Tournament]] by the streaking [[2016\u201317 Michigan Wolverines men's basketball team|Michigan]] who went on to win the championship. They received an at-large bid to the [[2017 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|NCAA Tournament]] as a No. 4 seed in where they defeated [[2016\u201317 Vermont Catamounts men's basketball team|Vermont]] and [[2016\u201317 Iowa State Cyclones men's basketball team|Iowa State]] to advance to the Sweet Sixteen where they were routed, 98-66, by the #1 seed [[2016\u201317 Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball team|Kansas]].\n\n==== 2017\u201318 season ====\nPurdue came into the season off of a [[Sweet Sixteen (basketball)|Sweet Sixteen]] appearance, accompanied by being the reigning [[Big Ten Conference men's basketball regular season champions]], making expectations for the season. However, with the departure of [[Caleb Swanigan]], the future was left uncertain. In the 2017\u20132018 season, Purdue, led by seniors Vince Edwards, Isaac Haas, PJ Thompson, Dakota Mathias and sophomore Carsen Edwards, spent several weeks at #3 while being on a program record and nation-leading 19-game winning streak. During that time, the Boilers led the nation in scoring margin, points per game, three-point shooting, and was one of only two teams with a top 3 ranking in both offensive and defensive efficiency. Purdue missed out on a consecutive B1G title after losing to Wisconsin, finishing 2nd in the conference at 15\u20133. The Boilers were seeded 3rd in the Big Ten Tournament, where they beat Rutgers and Penn State to reach the Big Ten Tournament Championship for the second time in three years. They faced a familiar opponent in Michigan, whom they had already faced two other times throughout that season, Purdue winning both meetings. However, Michigan beat Purdue 75\u201366 to become Big Ten Tournament Champions for the second straight season.\n\nPurdue was seeded 2nd in the East Region of the 2018 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament, their highest seed in recent history. In the first round, they faced Cal State Fullerton Titans, winning 74\u201348. However, many Purdue fan's hearts broke in the second half of the game, as senior Center Isaac Haas fell on his elbow as he fought for a rebound, and broke his elbow as he hit the ground, ending his Purdue Basketball career. Purdue's second-round game was against Butler Bulldogs, whom Purdue had already played earlier in the season. The Boilers would win the game on a last second shot by Dakota Mathias, winning 76\u201373 to advance to the Sweet Sixteen for the second straight season. In the Sweet Sixteen, Purdue faced the third seeded Texas Tech Red Raiders. The Boilers would go on to lose in disappointing fashion 65\u201378, ending their season with 30 wins, the most wins in program history.\n\n==== 2018\u201319 season ====\nIn 2019, Purdue was seeded 3rd in the South Region of the 2019 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament, after another strong season. In the first round, they defeated a 26\u20138 Old Dominion team that was coming off a Conference USA championship for a 61\u201348 win. In the second round, they handedly defeated #6 seed Villanova, sending the defending champs home early after an 87\u201361 victory, and advancing to their third straight Sweet Sixteen under Matt Painter. The Boilermakers ran into their first real test with the #2 Tennessee Volunteers. After a back and forth contest that included 17 lead changes and needed overtime to be decided, Purdue came out victorious, beating the Vols 99\u201394 to reach their first Elite Eight in nearly 20 years. In the Elite Eight, Purdue faced the #1 seeded Virginia Cavaliers in what would be another back and forth thriller. After several lead changes throughout the game, Purdue led 70\u201367 with 5.9 seconds left and looked to be headed to their first Final Four since 1980 when Virginia's Ty Jerome missed the second free throw of two. Virginia was able to come up with the offensive rebound however, and after chasing down the loose ball, Mamadi Diakite nailed a Hail Mary - type jumpshot at the buzzer to send the game to overtime. The Boilers were once again looking towards the big dance, leading 75\u201374 with 43 seconds to go, but Virginia was able to hold Purdue scoreless the rest of overtime and prevailed 80\u201375, ending the Boilermakers season with 26 wins and their first Elite Eight appearance since 2000.\n\n==NBA players coached==\n* [[Carsen Edwards]] (33rd, [[2019 NBA Draft]])\n* [[Vincent Edwards (basketball)|Vincent Edwards]] (52nd, [[2018 NBA Draft]])\n* [[Caleb Swanigan]] (26th, [[2017 NBA Draft]])\n* [[A.

Happy Birthday].\" ''The Garrett Clipper'': August 26, 2012. p. 5.</ref> is an American basketball coach and former player. He is currently the men's basketball coach at [[Purdue University]], having held that position since 2005. Before Purdue, Painter held coaching positions at Southern Illinois, Eastern Illinois, Barton College, and Washington & Jefferson College.\n\nPainter runs a motion offense that has consistently been one of the top five offenses in recent years.\n\nPainter's teams are also known for their \"stout, stingy, defense\" and their \"overwhelming offense\". Since 2016, Painter's teams have ranked 19th, 24th, 2nd, and 4th in offensive efficiency. Additionally, 7 of Painter's teams have ranked in the top 35 in defensive efficiency.\n\nWith Painter at the helm, Purdue teams have reached the NCAA Tournament eleven times, with five Sweet Sixteen appearances and one Elite Eight appearance. Painter also reached the NCAA Tournament in his one season at Southern Illinois, giving him a total of twelve tournament appearances in only fifteen years coaching.\n\nMatt Painter has coached a total of nine NBA players in his tenure at Purdue University.\n\n==Playing career==\nMatt Painter was born in [[Fort Wayne, Indiana]], and attended [[Delta High School (Muncie, Indiana)|Delta High School]], about 60 miles south in [[Muncie, Indiana]]. He played basketball for former basketball coach and athletic director, Stan Daugherty. He attended [[Purdue University]] as an undergraduate. He played four seasons as a [[Purdue Boilermakers|Boilermakers]] [[point guard]] under head coach [[Gene Keady]] and assistants [[Bruce Weber (basketball)|Bruce Weber]], and [[Steve Lavin]]. He helped lead the Boilermakers to three [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|NCAA Tournaments]] and one [[National Invitation Tournament|NIT]] appearance. He was teammates with [[Jimmy Oliver]], [[Steve Scheffler]] and [[Glenn Robinson]]. He started 50 of the 109 games in which he appeared and helped his team to a 75-45 overall record. In his senior season, he was selected as a team captain and was named an All-[[Big Ten Conference|Big Ten]] Honorable Mention. Painter finished his career averaging 4.5 points-per-game and totaling 276 assists.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! College !!

In the 1994-95 season, Barton finished with 13 wins and 13 losses.  Painter then moved to [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] as an assistant coach at [[Eastern Illinois Panthers|Eastern Illinois]] of the [[Ohio Valley Conference]], where he also received his master's degree.\n\n===Southern Illinois===\nAfter three years at Eastern Illinois, he moved to [[Southern Illinois Salukis men's basketball|Southern Illinois]] in 1998 as an assistant to head coach [[Bruce Weber (coach)|Bruce Weber]]. Painter was previously acquainted with him while Weber was an assistant coach at Purdue during Painter's playing days. Weber and Painter quickly turned a team that had a losing record the previous season into a successful team. Painter helped lead the Salukis to the [[National Invitational Tournament|NIT]] in 2000 and twice to the NCAA Tournament the following seasons while an assistant coach. In the 2001\u201302 season, they qualified for the [[2002 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|NCAA Tournament]] and ended their season in the Sweet Sixteen with a loss to [[Connecticut Huskies men's basketball|UConn]]. That year, SIU beat well-established programs such as [[Georgia Bulldogs men's basketball|Georgia]] and [[Texas Tech Red Raiders men's basketball|Texas Tech]]. In 2003, Weber's and Painter's Salukis were featured on [[Music Television|MTV]]'s special ''True Life: I Am a College Baller''.\n\nAfter serving as an assistant coach for five seasons at SIU, Matt Painter stepped into his first [[NCAA Division I]] head coaching position after Bruce Weber took the head coaching job at [[Illinois Fighting Illini men's basketball|Illinois]] for the 2003\u201304 season. Leading the Salukis to a 25\u20135 record and a berth in the [[2004 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|2004 NCAA Tournament]], the team was ranked as high as #15 in the nation by the [[AP poll]] during the season. Painter was named the 2003-2004 [[Missouri Valley Conference]] Coach of the Year.\n\n===Purdue===\n====2004\u201305 season====\nIn 2004, Painter was recruited by Purdue as the replacement for retiring head coach [[Gene Keady]]. He signed a six-year contract as the new [[Purdue Boilermakers men's basketball]] coach. As part of a planned transition, Painter was named the associate head coach for the 2004\u201305 season. He joined former teammate [[Cuonzo Martin]] (now head coach at [[Missouri Tigers men's basketball|University of Missouri]]) on the coaching staff. With key players out with injuries, suspensions and transfers, Purdue finished the season with a 7\u201321 record, the most losses in the program's history in a season.\n\n====2005\u201306 season====\nAt the start of the 2005\u201306 season, Painter took over for Keady as the head coach at his [[alma mater]] and became the second former Purdue player to become the head coach since Ray Eddy (1950\u20131965). In his first season in that role, despite the absences of injured starters, [[David Teague (basketball)|David Teague]] and [[Carl Landry]], and only playing with seven scholarship players, they finished with a 9-19 record. Painter's first Purdue squad as a head coach came up with wins against eventual NCAA Tournament qualifier [[Wisconsin Badgers men's basketball|Wisconsin]] and #23 [[Michigan Wolverines men's basketball|Michigan]].\n\n====2006\u201307 season====\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:painter .jpg|thumb|right|300px|An animated Painter at head coach at Purdue]] -->\nIn his second season as head coach, the team had high hopes for an NCAA berth. Both [[power forward (basketball)|power forward]] [[Carl Landry]] and [[shooting guard]] [[David Teague (basketball)|David Teague]] returned to the lineup after injuries, combining an average of about 34 points and 15 rebounds per game. Painter's Boilermakers finished the non-conference season with an 11-3 record, which included wins over previously unbeaten and top 25 schools [[Virginia Cavaliers men's basketball|Virginia]] and [[Missouri Tigers men's basketball|Missouri]]. They headed deep into the regular season without a road win. The team had also not won a road game in the two prior seasons during which Painter was part of the Boilermaker's bench. That 29 road-game losing streak ended on February 3, 2007, when Purdue beat [[Penn State Nittany Lions men's basketball|Penn State]] at the [[Bryce Jordan Center]]. After winning seven of their last ten conference games during the regular season and setting a single-season school record for most home wins at 16 in [[Mackey Arena]], Painter and his Boilermakers finished the regular season with a 9-7 conference record. They received a 5th seed in the Big Ten Tournament and were knocked out in the semifinals when they lost to a [[Greg Oden]]-led [[Ohio State Buckeyes men's basketball|Ohio State]] team. Purdue was invited to the [[2007 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|2007 NCAA Tournament]], Painter's second appearance as a head coach, and received a 9 seed. The team's opening round opponent was [[Lute Olson]]'s [[Arizona Wildcats men's basketball|Arizona]]. After beating the Wildcats, Purdue fell to [[Billy Donovan]]'s number one seeded and defending/eventual national champions, [[Florida Gators men's basketball|Florida]]. With +13 wins from the previous season, it was the biggest win-margin turnaround in the program's history.\n\n====2007\u201308 season====\nComing off one of the program's biggest single season improvements, Painter returned only one senior on the roster with 6 newcomers. Painter achieved notable recruiting success, signing one of the top five recruiting classes in the nation for 2007, all coming from the state of Indiana. Painter started at least three freshmen in every game at the start of the '07-'08 season, making it the youngest starting line-up in the nation. His \"[[baby boilers]]\" finished the non-conference season with a 9-4 record, which included a win against [[Rick Pitino]]'s #22 ranked [[Louisville Cardinals men's basketball|Louisville]], as well as a loss to [[Wofford College|Wofford]], their only home loss of the season. During an eleven-game winning streak in conference play, they swept the season series with the conference champion #8 Wisconsin and had a home win against #9 [[Michigan State Spartans men's basketball|Michigan State]]. It was the first back-to-back wins versus top ten teams in school history. Their winning streak was ended when they lost to in-state rival, #14 [[Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball|Indiana]]. Painter and his Boilers finished the regular season in 2nd place with a 15-3 record.  During the regular season and into the conference tournament, Purdue was ranked as high as #15 in both polls. Painter's team entered the Big Ten Tournament with the #2 seed. They lost in the quarterfinals to the 10th seeded Illinois. They were invited to the [[2008 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|2008 NCAA Tournament]] and given a #6 seed. They beat [[Baylor Bears men's basketball|Baylor]] in the first round, giving Purdue its 10th straight first round win in the tournament. They lost in the second round to a senior-led [[Xavier Musketeers men's basketball|Xavier]] team. Matt was eventually named the [[Big Ten Conference Men's Basketball Coach of the Year|Big Ten Conference Coach of the Year]]. The Boilers finished the season with a 25-9 record.\n\n====2008\u201309 season====\nPainter's Boilermakers began the [[2008-09 Purdue Boilermakers men's basketball team|2008-2009]] season with an [[ESPN]]/[[USA Today]] Poll rank at #10 and an [[AP Top 25]] #11 ranking. They had five returning starters from the prior season, including [[Chris Kramer]], the conference's defensive player of the year and two all-conference selections in [[E'Twaun Moore]] and [[Robbie Hummel]]. Painter's Boilers opened the season with a 5\u20130 record. In the first game of the season, his team set the school record for fewest turnovers in a game, only committing three, against [[University of Detroit Mercy|Detroit]] on November 14, 2008. With a #9 ranking, Purdue had their first losses of the season back-to-back in overtime to #13 ranked [[Oklahoma Sooners men's basketball|Oklahoma]] in the [[NIT Season Tip-Off]] championship game and a 16-point home loss against #4 [[Duke Blue Devils men's basketball|Duke]]. They finished the pre-season with an 11-2 record, which included a win against #22 [[Davidson Wildcats men's basketball|Davidson]]. Purdue finished third in conference play, including a season-sweep by Illinois and splitting the season meetings with conference title winners, Michigan State. Near the end of the regular season, Matt was selected as one of ten candidates for the [[Henry Iba Award]], which goes to the nation's best coach of the year. With a much healthier Robbie Hummel in the lineup, they entered the [[2009 Big Ten Conference Men's Basketball Tournament|Big Ten Tournament]] with the #3 seed, beating Ohio State in the finals, giving Purdue its first conference tournament championship in school history. Throughout the tournament, Painter's team averaged 16 assists and less than six turnovers in three games. Matt Painter led his team to a third straight [[2009 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|NCAA Tournament]] appearance with a #5 seed, the team's highest seed in 10 years. They beat [[Northern Iowa]] from the [[Missouri Valley Conference|MVC]] in the first round, becoming the program's 11th straight first round win dating back to 1994. After beating [[Washington Huskies men's basketball|Washington]] in the Second Round, Purdue reached their first [[NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Championship|Sweet Sixteen]] in 9 years, eventually losing to [[Jim Calhoun]]'s [[Hasheem Thabeet]]-led [[Connecticut Huskies men's basketball|UConn]]. Painter's team finished the season with a 27\u201310 record, the most games played in a season in its program's history. Despite beginning his Purdue head coaching position coming off a prior 7-win season, Matt surpassed Gene Keady's first four season's (1981\u20131985) win total of 82 in his first four (2005\u20132009) with 83 victories.\n\n=====U19 USA Championships Team=====\nOn May 12, 2009, Matt Painter accepted an assistant coach position for the 2009 USA Basketball U19 World Championships team. Along with current head coach and former fellow assistant, [[Chris Lowery]], at [[Southern Illinois Salukis men's basketball|Southern Illinois]], he served under [[Pittsburgh Panthers men's basketball|Pittsburgh]] head coach, [[Jamie Dixon]]. Painter helped lead the team to a 9-0 record with a 22.2 point win margin, while winning the gold after beating [[Greece]].\n\n====2009\u201310 season====\n[[File:Matt Painter Purdue.jpg|thumb|right|Painter coaching on the sideline]]\nMatt Painter and his team began the [[2009\u201310 Purdue Boilermakers men's basketball team|2009\u201310]] season with a 14\u20130 record, which tied the [[1993\u201394 Boilermakers men's basketball team|1993\u201394 team]] for the best start in the program's history. He returned his entire regular starting five, including three all-conference selections in [[JaJuan Johnson]], E'Twaun Moore, and Robbie Hummel. Painter started his fifth season at Purdue with his team receiving a preseason 7th overall ranking by both the Associated Press and Coaches Polls, the program's highest in 22 years. Coach Painter led his top ten ranked team to the 2009 [[Paradise Jam Tournament]] championship against [[Bruce Pearl]]'s #10 [[Tennessee Volunteers men's basketball|Tennessee]], followed by the preseason close with a home win over #6 [[West Virginia Mountaineers men's basketball|West Virginia]] and a 12-0 record against non-conference opponents. On January 28, 2010, Matt won his 100th game as Purdue's head coach against [[Wisconsin Badgers men's basketball|Wisconsin]], becoming the fourth fastest to reach the mark behind former Purdue coaches [[Ward Lambert]], [[George King (basketball, born 1928)|George King]], and [[Gene Keady]]. Deep into the regular conference season, Matt Painter got his first career road wins against #10 [[Michigan State Spartans men's basketball|Michigan State]] in [[East Lansing, Michigan|East Lansing]] and #9 [[Ohio State Buckeyes men's basketball|Ohio State]] in [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]], leaving Purdue as the only team in the nation to go 4\u20130 against top ten teams. With a ten-game winning streak in conference play, Purdue received a #3 ranking in both polls, giving Painter his highest ranking as both a player and head coach, while being the program's highest in sixteen years. After losing All-Conference starter Robbie Hummel to an [[Anterior cruciate ligament|ACL]] injury, Painter pushed his junior/senior-led team in the last three conference games (2\u20131), culminating with a 14\u20134 conference record and a share of the Big Ten title, the program's first in fourteen years. At the end of the regular season, Matt Painter was named the coaches' pick for [[Big Ten Conference Men's Basketball Coach of the Year|Big Ten Conference Coach of the Year]], his second time being honored with the title since arriving at Purdue. After beating [[Siena Saints men's basketball|Siena]] in the First Round of the [[2010 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament|NCAA Tournament]] and [[Texas A&M]] in the Second Round with a 4 seed, Painter has led Purdue to consecutive Sweet Sixteen appearances and currently has an overall 6-4 record in NCAA Tournament games after losing to Duke. Finishing with a 29\u20136 record, it tied for most wins in a season in school history.\n\n====2010\u201311 season====\nComing off the most wins in a four-year span in school history with 102 (2007\u20132010), Matt Painter and his Boiler squad returned two All-American candidates (JaJuan Johnson, E'Twaun Moore), its primary point guard ([[Lewis Jackson (basketball player)|Lewis Jackson]]), and an All-Conference freshman (Kelsey Barlow). ESPN's [[Andy Katz]] selected Purdue as the preseason No. 1-ranked team for the [[2010-11 Purdue Boilermakers men's basketball team|2011]] season, while [[Fox Sports (USA)|Fox Sports]] selected them as the No. 4 favorite.<ref>http://msn.foxsports.com/cbk/gallery/Goodman-Your-2010-11-NCAA--top-25#sport=CBK&photo=11110047</ref> These predictions came premature as fellow All-American candidate, Robbie Hummel, re-tore his ACL during practice, preventing him from playing his senior season. Joining the sidelines was Painter's latest addition to his bench staff, Mike Jackson, a former [[Michigan Wolverines men's basketball|Michigan]] assistant coach. In preseason play, Painter's team began the season ranked as high as eighth in the nation and fell as low as 22nd following a loss to [[2011\u201312 Richmond Spiders men's basketball team|Richmond]] in the [[Chicago Invitational Challenge|Chicago Invitational]] finals. Painter's Boilers went undefeated at home on the season for the first time in 42 years (16\u20130). They tied series with ranked [[2011\u201312 Wisconsin Badgers men's basketball team|Wisconsin]], [[Minnesota Golden Gophers men's basketball|Minnesota]], and the top-ranked team in the nation, [[2011\u201312 Ohio State Buckeyes men's basketball team|Ohio State]]. No. 6 Purdue finished second in the [[2010\u201311 Big Ten Conference men's basketball season|Big Ten Conference]] with a 14\u20134 record, while finishing the regular season 26\u20138 overall. At the conclusion of the regular season, Painter was named [[Big Ten Conference Men's Basketball Coach of the Year|Big Ten Conference Coach of the Year]] for the third time in four seasons. Painter received his highest [[2011 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|NCAA Tournament]] seeding as a coach, with No. 13-ranked Purdue being named a No. 3 seed in the Tournament. They defeated [[2010\u201311 Saint Peter's Peacocks basketball team|Saint Peter's]] in the First Round, but were upset by Final Four-bound No. 11 seed [[2010\u201311 VCU Rams men's basketball team|VCU]] the Second Round.\n\n=====Connection to Missouri vacancy=====\nOn March 30, 2011, it was reported that Painter might accept the [[Missouri Tigers men's basketball|University of Missouri]] head coaching position. However, after the initial reports surfaced, Purdue announced that Painter had accepted a new eight-year deal to remain with the school.<ref name=\"Purdue, Painter Agree To New Eight-Year Contract\">{{cite web | url=http://www.purduesports.com/sports/m-baskbl/spec-rel/033011aab.html | title=Painter signs new deal | accessdate=March 30, 2011}}</ref>\n\n====2011\u201312 season====\nAfter losing All-American seniors in JaJuan Johnson and E'Twaun Moore to graduation and the [[NBA]], Painter returned a handful of experienced role players and Preseason First Team All-Big Ten forward Robbie Hummel, who returned from a second ACL injury. His Boiler squad began the [[2011-12 Purdue Boilermakers men's basketball team|2012]] season unranked for the first time in four seasons. Joining him on the bench were two new assistant coaches in [[Micah Shrewsberry]], who was part of the coaching staff that guided [[Butler Bulldogs men's basketball|Butler]] to consecutive NCAA Finals, and [[Greg Gary (basketball)|Greg Gary]], who previously assisted at [[Duquesne Dukes men's basketball|Duquesne]], [[South Florida Bulls men's basketball|South Florida]], [[Miami Hurricanes men's basketball|Miami]], and [[Tulane Green Wave men's basketball|Tulane]]. On November 11, Painter's squad opened the season beating [[Northern Illinois Huskies|Northern Illinois]] by 62 points, the program's highest win margin since 1911. Painter's team received its first loss of the season against No. 15-ranked [[Alabama Crimson Tide men's basketball|Alabama]] in the [[Puerto Rico Tip-Off]] title game. Their second loss of the season came on the road against No. 11-ranked [[2011\u201312 Xavier Musketeers men's basketball team|Xavier]], a game where Painter's squad forced a season-high 22 turnovers and was up by 19 points in the second half. On December 17 at [[Conseco Fieldhouse]], his team was upset by [[2011\u201312 Butler Bulldogs men's basketball team|Butler]] after losing a 15-point lead, losing by two. Closing the preseason with a 10\u20133 record and a 3\u20132 start in conference play, Purdue owned the fifth longest home winning streak in the nation at 27 before losing to [[2011\u201312 Wisconsin Badgers men's basketball team|Wisconsin]]. Against [[2011\u201312 Illinois Fighting Illini men's basketball team|Illinois]] on New Year's Eve, Painter received his 150th win at Purdue and his 175th career win as a head coach. Three times in conference play, Painter's squad committed a school-record three turnovers in a game, losing all three, which included a three-point loss in a road game against No. 3 [[2011\u201312 Ohio State Buckeyes men's basketball team|Ohio State]]. Painter got his first win against a ranked team on the season beating No. 11 [[2011\u201312 Michigan Wolverines men's basketball team|Michigan]] on the road by 14 points, giving Michigan their only home loss on the season. His squad led the nation in fewest turnovers, committing just 8.9 per game (7.6 in conference play) while averaging a \u20134.6 turnover margin against opponents. With the 20th win on the season against [[2011\u201312 Penn State Nittany Lions basketball team|Penn State]] on February 29, Painter gave Purdue its sixth consecutive 20-win season, tying a program record with Gene Keady's mid-1980s mark. Purdue ended the [[2011\u201312 Big Ten Conference men's basketball season|Big Ten season]] at 10\u20138 in conference play (sixth) and stood at 21\u201312 overall after the [[2012 Big Ten Conference Men's Basketball Tournament|Big Ten Tournament]]. On March 11, the Boilermakers received an at-large bid as the No. 10 seed in the Midwest region of the [[2012 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|NCAA Tournament]]. In the first round of the Tournament, Purdue beat No. 7 seed [[2011\u201312 Saint Mary's Gaels men's basketball team|Saint Mary's]] 72\u201369, their 14th straight First Round victory, the longest current streak at that time. In the Second Round, Purdue lost to No. 2 [[2011\u201312 Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball team|Kansas]] 63\u201360. Purdue ended the season 22\u201313, their sixth straight year with 22 or more wins.\n\n====2012\u201313 season====\nPainter began the [[2012-13 Purdue Boilermakers men's basketball team|2013]] season after losing three senior starters from the previous season including All-American [[Robbie Hummel]] and point guard [[Lewis Jackson (basketball, born 1989)|Lewis Jackson]]. Also leaving the program were would-be seniors in shooting guard John Hart (transferred to [[IUPUI Jaguars men's basketball|IUPUI]]) and suspended guard/forward Kelsey Barlow (transferred to [[UIC Flames men's basketball|UIC]]). Painter's raw and young squad began the season with a 2\u20133 record, losing their season opener for the first time during the Painter-era. Purdue went on to lose games to [[2012\u201313 Villanova Wildcats men's basketball team|Villanova]] and [[2012\u201313 Oregon State Beavers men's basketball team|Oregon State]] at [[Madison Square Garden]] in the [[2K Sports Classic]]. The Boilers finished 7\u20136 in non-conference play. In [[2012\u201313 Big Ten Conference men's basketball season|Big Ten play]], Painter consistently started at least three freshmen, which included a B1G-All Freshman [[A. J. Hammons]] and Ronnie Johnson. Painter's squad made improvement towards the end of the season, after going through much inconsistency, getting wins at No. 7 [[2012\u201313 Wisconsin Badgers men's basketball team|Wisconsin]], a near upset against of No. 7 [[2012\u201313 Michigan Wolverines men's basketball team|Michigan]], and a blowout win against Minnesota, Painter's 200th career win. Finishing seventh in conference play with an 8\u201310 record, Purdue lost to [[2012\u201313 Nebraska Cornhuskers men's basketball team|Nebraska]] in the first round of the [[2013 Big Ten Conference Men's Basketball Tournament|Big Ten Tournament]]. Purdue accepted a bid to the [[2013 College Basketball Invitational|CBI]], where they defeated [[Western Illinois]] before losing to [[Santa Clara Broncos|Santa Clara]] and finishing with a 16\u201318 overall record.\n\n====2013\u201314 season====\nIn his [[2013\u201314 Purdue Boilermakers men's basketball team|ninth season]] at Purdue, the Boilermakers started well, finishing the non-conference slate at 10\u20133.  However, the Boilers struggled in [[2013\u201314 Big Ten Conference men's basketball season|Big Ten play]] despite winning three of their first five games in conference. The Boilers would lose 11 of their last 13 regular season games to finish last in the league with a 5\u201313 record. A loss in the first round of the [[2014 Big Ten Conference Men's Basketball Tournament|Big Ten Tournament]] to No. 24 [[2013\u201314 Ohio State Buckeyes men's basketball team|Ohio State]] left Purdue with a 15\u201317 overall record and without a postseason.\n\n====2014\u201315 season====\nIn his 10th season as Purdue's head coach, Painter brought in three contributing freshman, including the tallest player in the program's history, 7'2\" Isaac Haas.  With an 8\u20135 non-conference record that included a blowout loss to a ranked [[2014\u201315 Notre Dame Fighting Irish men's basketball team|Notre Dame]] and home losses to [[2014\u201315 North Florida Ospreys men's basketball team|North Florida]] and [[2014\u201315 Gardner\u2013Webb Runnin' Bulldogs men's basketball team|Gardner Webb]], Painter was viewed by many as being on the hot seat. With the play of juniors A. J. Hammons and Rapheal Davis and the additional lift of transfer senior point guard John Octeus, [[2014\u201315 Purdue Boilermakers men's basketball team|Painter's squad]] turned things around in conference play. They finished third in conference with a 12\u20136 record after being predicted to finish near the bottom of the league. They defeated three ranked teams in a four-game stretch with home wins against No. 25 [[2014\u201315 Iowa Hawkeyes men's basketball team|Iowa]], No. 20 [[2014\u201315 Ohio State Buckeyes men's basketball team|Ohio State]], and No. 21 [[2014\u201315 Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball team|Indiana]]. During this time, Painter received his 100th Big Ten win and reached a personal 9\u20138 winning record against in-state rivals Indiana with a season sweep. A loss in the semifinals of the [[2015 Big Ten Conference Men's Basketball Tournament|Big Ten Tournament]] to No. 6 [[2014\u201315 Wisconsin Badgers men's basketball team|Wisconsin]] preceded an at-large bid to the [[2015 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|NCAA Tournament]]. The trip marked Painter's eighth appearance as a head coach. The No. 9-seeded Boilers would fall in overtime to the No. 8-seeded [[2014\u201315 Cincinnati Bearcats men's basketball team|Cincinnati]] in the First Round. They finished with a 21\u201313 overall record on the season.\n\n====2015\u201316 season====\nPainter accomplished a first in his coaching career by landing a five-star recruit in 2015 [[Indiana Mr. Basketball]] [[Caleb Swanigan]], who switched his commitment from Michigan State to Purdue. Painter led the [[2015\u201316 Purdue Boilermakers men's basketball team|team]] to a 26\u20139 overall record. The team maintained an AP Top 25 ranking throughout their entire season, but showed inconsistency. The team boasted victories over conference heavyweights [[2015\u201316 Michigan State Spartans men's basketball team|Michigan State]], [[2015\u201316 Maryland Terrapins men's basketball team|Maryland]], and [[2015\u201316 Wisconsin Badgers men's basketball team|Wisconsin]]. In the Big Ten Tournament, the fell four points shy of the championship losing to Michigan State. The team's inconsistency continued as they fell to 12-seeded [[2015\u201316 Little Rock Trojans men's basketball team|Arkansas-Little Rock]] in the First Round of the [[2017 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|NCAA Tournament]].\n\nSenior center [[A. J. Hammons]] was selected as a finalist for the [[Kareem Abdul-Jabbar Award]] for best center, and was selected as Big Ten Defensive Player of the Year, succeeding Purdue teammate and 2015 recipient Raphael Davis.\n\n==== 2016\u201317 season ====\n[[2016\u201317 Purdue Boilermakers men's basketball team|Purdue]] was ranked in the top-25 throughout the entire season, the second consecutive season to boast that accomplishment. They won their 23rd [[2016\u201317 Big Ten Conference men's basketball season|Big Ten Conference]] regular season championship and first outright title in 21 years (1996) by finishing the season with a 25\u20136 record, 14\u20134 in conference. This was the Boilermakers best record and first conference championship since [[2009\u201310 Purdue Boilermakers men's basketball team|2010]]. They ended the year by winning 10 out of their last 12 games. Sophomore forward [[Caleb Swanigan]] was named [[Big Ten Conference Men's Basketball Player of the Year|Big Ten Player of the Year]] in a unanimous vote, the first Purdue player to win that award since [[JaJuan Johnson]]. They lost in their first game in the [[2017 Big Ten Conference Men's Basketball Tournament|Big Ten Tournament]] by the streaking [[2016\u201317 Michigan Wolverines men's basketball team|Michigan]] who went on to win the championship. They received an at-large bid to the [[2017 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament|NCAA Tournament]] as a No. 4 seed in where they defeated [[2016\u201317 Vermont Catamounts men's basketball team|Vermont]] and [[2016\u201317 Iowa State Cyclones men's basketball team|Iowa State]] to advance to the Sweet Sixteen where they were routed, 98-66, by the #1 seed [[2016\u201317 Kansas Jayhawks men's basketball team|Kansas]].\n\n==== 2017\u201318 season ====\nPurdue came into the season off of a [[Sweet Sixteen (basketball)|Sweet Sixteen]] appearance, accompanied by being the reigning [[Big Ten Conference men's basketball regular season champions]], making expectations for the season. However, with the departure of [[Caleb Swanigan]], the future was left uncertain. In the 2017\u20132018 season, Purdue, led by seniors Vince Edwards, Isaac Haas, PJ Thompson, Dakota Mathias and sophomore Carsen Edwards, spent several weeks at #3 while being on a program record and nation-leading 19-game winning streak. During that time, the Boilers led the nation in scoring margin, points per game, three-point shooting, and was one of only two teams with a top 3 ranking in both offensive and defensive efficiency. Purdue missed out on a consecutive B1G title after losing to Wisconsin, finishing 2nd in the conference at 15\u20133. The Boilers were seeded 3rd in the Big Ten Tournament, where they beat Rutgers and Penn State to reach the Big Ten Tournament Championship for the second time in three years. They faced a familiar opponent in Michigan, whom they had already faced two other times throughout that season, Purdue winning both meetings. However, Michigan beat Purdue 75\u201366 to become Big Ten Tournament Champions for the second straight season.\n\nPurdue was seeded 2nd in the East Region of the 2018 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament, their highest seed in recent history. In the first round, they faced Cal State Fullerton Titans, winning 74\u201348. However, many Purdue fan's hearts broke in the second half of the game, as senior Center Isaac Haas fell on his elbow as he fought for a rebound, and broke his elbow as he hit the ground, ending his Purdue Basketball career. Purdue's second-round game was against Butler Bulldogs, whom Purdue had already played earlier in the season. The Boilers would win the game on a last second shot by Dakota Mathias, winning 76\u201373 to advance to the Sweet Sixteen for the second straight season. In the Sweet Sixteen, Purdue faced the third seeded Texas Tech Red Raiders. The Boilers would go on to lose in disappointing fashion 65\u201378, ending their season with 30 wins, the most wins in program history.\n\n==== 2018\u201319 season ====\nIn 2019, Purdue was seeded 3rd in the South Region of the 2019 NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Tournament, after another strong season. In the first round, they defeated a 26\u20138 Old Dominion team that was coming off a Conference USA championship for a 61\u201348 win. In the second round, they handedly defeated #6 seed Villanova, sending the defending champs home early after an 87\u201361 victory, and advancing to their third straight Sweet Sixteen under Matt Painter. The Boilermakers ran into their first real test with the #2 Tennessee Volunteers. After a back and forth contest that included 17 lead changes and needed overtime to be decided, Purdue came out victorious, beating the Vols 99\u201394 to reach their first Elite Eight in nearly 20 years. In the Elite Eight, Purdue faced the #1 seeded Virginia Cavaliers in what would be another back and forth thriller. After several lead changes throughout the game, Purdue led 70\u201367 with 5.9 seconds left and looked to be headed to their first Final Four since 1980 when Virginia's Ty Jerome missed the second free throw of two. Virginia was able to come up with the offensive rebound however, and after chasing down the loose ball, Mamadi Diakite nailed a Hail Mary - type jumpshot at the buzzer to send the game to overtime. The Boilers were once again looking towards the big dance, leading 75\u201374 with 43 seconds to go, but Virginia was able to hold Purdue scoreless the rest of overtime and prevailed 80\u201375, ending the Boilermakers season with 26 wins and their first Elite Eight appearance since 2000.\n\n==NBA players coached==\n* [[Carsen Edwards]] (33rd, [[2019 NBA Draft]])\n* [[Vincent Edwards (basketball)|Vincent Edwards]] (52nd, [[2018 NBA Draft]])\n* [[Caleb Swanigan]] (26th, [[2017 NBA Draft]])\n* [[A.

It covers [[Tr\u00f8ndelag]] county in [[Central Norway]] and its cathedral city is [[Trondheim]], which houses the well-known [[Nidaros Cathedral]].  The diocese is divided into 10 [[deanery|deaneries]] ''(prosti)''.  Since 10 September 2017, the Bishop of Nidaros is [[Herborg Finnset]] who took over from the Bishop [[Tor Singsaas]] who retired.  The [[Preses (Church of Norway)|Bishop Preses]] is also based at the [[Nidaros Cathedral]] and serves as the dean of the [[Nidaros domprosti]] (deanery) in [[Trondheim]]. \n\n==History==\nThe diocese of Nidaros was established in 1068. It originally covered the (modern) counties of [[Tr\u00f8ndelag]], [[Nordland]], [[Troms]], and [[Finnmark]], along with the regions of [[Nordm\u00f8re]] and [[Romsdal]] (in [[M\u00f8re og Romsdal]] county) and [[H\u00e4rjedalen]] (in [[Sweden]]), and also the northern part of [[\u00d8sterdalen]] ([[Tynset]], [[Tolga, Norway|Tolga]], and [[Os, Hedmark|Os]]). The region of [[Sunnm\u00f8re]] (in [[M\u00f8re og Romsdal]]) was transferred from [[Diocese of Bj\u00f8rgvin]] to the new [[Archdiocese of Nidaros]] some time after 1152 \u2013 to secure it more income.\n\nThe northern part of \u00d8sterdalen was transferred to the [[Diocese of Oslo]] some time after 1537.

The region of Sunnm\u00f8re was transferred (back) from Nidaros to the Diocese of Bj\u00f8rgvin in 1622. The provinces of J\u00e4mtland and H\u00e4rjedalen were lost to [[Sweden]] in 1645. [[Northern Norway]] was established as a diocese of its own in 1804 (formally first in 1844). The parish of [[Innset, S\u00f8r-Tr\u00f8ndelag|Innset]] was transferred from [[Diocese of Hamar]] to Nidaros in 1966.

Adaptations to wheelchair tires are another example; widening the tires enables wheelchair users to move over soft surfaces, such as deep snow on ski hills, and sandy beaches.\n\nAssistive technology and adaptive technology have a key role in developing the means for people with disabilities to live more independently, and to more fully participate in mainstream society. In order to have access to assistive or adaptive technology, however, educating the public and even legislating requirements to incorporate this technology have been necessary.\n\n==Employment==\n[[File:Usda hiring applicants with disabilities.jpg|thumb|upright|William P.

Workers in Western countries fare relatively well, having access to more services and training as well as legal protections against employment discrimination.

This translates into an earnings gap where individuals with disabilities earn about 25 percent less of what workers without disabilities earn. Among occupations with 100,000 or more people, dishwashers had the highest disability rate (14.3%), followed by refuse and recyclable material collectors (12.7%), personal care aides (11.9%), and janitors and building cleaners (11.8%).

Although employment for workers with disabilities is higher in the public sector due to hiring programs targeting persons with disabilities, regulations currently restrict types of work available to persons with disabilities:\n\"Disability-specific employment reservations are limited to the public sector and a large number of the reserved positions continue to be vacant despite nearly two decades of enactment of the PWD Act\".<ref name=\"dsq-sds\" />\n\nExpenses related to adaptive or assistive technology required to participate in the workforce may be tax deductible expenses for individuals with a medical practitioner's prescription in some jurisdictions.\n\n===Disability Management===\nDisability Management (DM) is a specialized area of [[human resources]], to support efforts by employers to better integrate and retain workers with disabilities. Some workplaces have policies in place to provide \"reasonable accommodation\" for employees with disabilities, however, many do not. In some jurisdictions, employers may have legal requirements to end [[ableism|discrimination against persons with disabilities]].\n\nIt has been noted by researchers that where accommodations are in place for employees with disabilities, these frequently apply to individuals with \"pre-determined or apparent disabilities as determined by national social protection or Equality Authorities\",<ref name=\"Geisen165\">{{cite book|author1=Geisen, Thomas |author2=Henry George Harder|title=Disability Management and Workplace Integration: International Research Findings|year=2011|publisher=Gower Publishing|isbn=9781409418887|pages=165}}</ref> which include persons with pre-existing conditions who receive an official disability designation. One of the biggest challenges for employers is in developing policies and practises to manage employees who develop disabilities during the course of employment. Even where these exist, they tend to focus on workplace injuries, overlooking job retention challenges faced by employees who acquire a non-occupation injury or illness. Protecting employability is a factor that can help close the unemployment gap for persons with disabilities.<ref name=\"Geisen165\" />\n\n===Meeting and conference access===\nMeetings and conferences should consider the needs of all of their participants.

Such an approach neglects the influence of interventions in the transport system on broader and often conflicting economic, social and environmental goals. Accessibility based planning defines accessibility as the amount of services and jobs people can access within a certain travel time, considering one or more modes of transport such as walking, cycling, driving or public transport.\nUsing this definition accessibility does not only relate to the qualities of the transport system (e.g. travel speed, time or costs), but also to the qualities of the land use system (e.g. densities and mixes of opportunities). It thus provides planners with the possibility to understand interdependencies between transport and land use development. Accessibility planning opens the floor to a more normative approach to transportation planning involving different actors.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.plan4sustainabletravel.org/key_themes/accessibility_key_features/|title=Planning for Sustainable Travel - Key Themes - Accessibility of Key Facilities|website=plan4sustainabletravel.org|access-date=2018-07-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180208070132/http://www.plan4sustainabletravel.org/key_themes/accessibility_key_features/|archive-date=2018-02-08|url-status=dead}}</ref> For politicians, citizens and firms it might be easier to discuss the quality of access to education, services and markets than it is to discuss the inefficiencies of the transport system itself. Accessibility is also defined as \"the potential for interaction\".\n\n===Accessibility instruments===\nGenerally since the 1960s, accessibility instruments have been developed for a multitude of contexts and scopes. These instruments have their focus on origins and on destinations, they measure access through time, distance or cost and focus on different modes of transportation and geographical scales. Accessibility instruments are thus able to show what are the best accessible places or opportunities within a city or region, considering one or more specific modes of transportation, timeslots and target groups. In addition to this, the maps, which are produced as the instrument output, are considered as considerably useful when assessing the effects of new developments in a city. The first ever first large scale compendium of accessibility instruments was developed in 2012, under the framework of Cost Action TU1002, and is available.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.accessibilityplanning.eu/accessibility-instruments-2/|title=Accessibility Instruments|website=accessibilityplanning.eu}}</ref>\n\n===Potentials of accessibility in planning practice===\nDespite the high potential of accessibility in integrating the different components of urban planning, such as land use and transportation and the large number of accessibility instruments available in the research literature, the latter are not widely used to support urban planning practices.<ref>{{cite book |title=Accessibility Instruments for Planning Practice|date=June 2012|publisher=COST Office|isbn=978-989-20-3210-8 |author1=Angela Hull |author2=Cec\u00edlia Silva |author3=Luca Bertolini |url=http://www.accessibilityplanning.eu/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/COST-Report-1-FINAL.pdf}}</ref> By keeping the accessibility language out of the practice level, older paradigms resist the more informed and people-centred approaches.\nFocusing on the link between research and practice, the Cost Action TU1002 <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tut.fi/edge/?page_id=182|title=COST Action TU1002 {{!}} EDGE|website=tut.fi|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-02}}</ref> seeks to find out why accessibility instruments are not more often used in urban planning practice and reflects on how to reduce such implementation gap in planning practice. The existence of accessibility instruments is fairly acknowledged, but practitioners do not appear to have found them useful or usable enough for addressing the tasks of sustainable urban management.\nThis Cost Action TU1002 is bringing together developers of accessibility instruments all over Europe and Australia to work with land use and transportation planning practitioners to explore how these instruments can play a more supportive role in enhancing accessibility in European cities and beyond. So far, 24 Accessibility Instruments have been gathered, analysed and described so as to understand in detail their characteristics, planning issues addressed and specific purposes, according to the developers\u2019 view. In turn, these instruments are being tested in a series of workshops with multidisciplinary teams of practitioners around Europe addressing the issue of usability from the practitioners\u2019 viewpoint. In doing so, it is expected that the additional knowledge on the potential of accessibility instruments for urban planning practice will have beneficial impacts on urban quality and decision making on urban land use patterns.\n\n==Transportation==\n{{for|the metric of transport connectivity for planning purposes|Accessibility (transport)}}\n[[File:Curitiba 10 2006 04 RIT.jpg|alt=ramps lowered from the side of a bus are level with the station's high platform|thumb|Accessibility to all [[autobus|buses]] is provided in [[Curitiba]]'s [[Rede Integrada de Transporte|public transport]] system, [[Brazil]].]]\n[[File:\u53f0\u5317\u8eca\u7ad9\u7121\u969c\u7919\u96fb\u68af.jpg|thumb|An [[elevator]] at [[Taipei Railway Station]] allowing for wheelchair access.]]\n[[File:Taxi wheelchair.jpg|thumb|A wheelchair accessible [[taxi]] with a rear ramp, [[Tokyo Motor Show]] 2009.]]\n[[File:Protram205 ramp.JPG|thumb|[[Wheelchair ramp|Wheelchair-access ramp]] in [[Protram 205 WrAs]] tram.]]\nProviding mobility to people with disabilities includes changes for public facilities like gently sloping paths of travel for people with wheelchairs and difficulty walking up stairs, or audio announcements for the blind; dedicated services like [[paratransit]]; and adaptations to personal vehicles.\n\n===Adapted automobiles for persons with disabilities===\n{{See also|Adapted automobile}}\nAutomobile accessibility also refers to ease of use by disabled people. Automobiles, whether a car or a van, can be adapted for a range of physical disabilities. Foot pedals can be raised, or replaced with hand-controlled devices. Wheelchair hoists, lifts or ramps may be customized according to the needs of the driver. [[Ergonomic]] adaptations, such as a lumbar support cushion, may also be needed.<ref>{{cite book|last=Dimond|first=Bridget C.|title=Legal Aspects of Physiotherapy|year=2009|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=9781405176156|pages=[https://archive.org/details/legalaspectsofph0000dimo/page/263 263]|url=https://archive.org/details/legalaspectsofph0000dimo/page/263}}</ref>\n\nGenerally, the more limiting the disability, the more expensive the adaptation needed for the vehicle. Financial assistance is available through some organizations, such as [[Motability]] in the United Kingdom, which requires a contribution by the prospective vehicle owner. Motability makes vehicles available for purchase or lease.<ref>{{cite book|last=Dimond|first=Bridget C.|title=Legal Aspects of Occupational Therapy|year=2011|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=9781444348163|pages=n.p}}</ref>\n\nWhen an employee with a disability requires an adapted car for work use, the employee does not have to pay for a \"[[reasonable accommodation|reasonable adjustment]]\" in the United Kingdom; if the employer is unable to pay the cost, assistance is offered by government programs.<ref>{{cite book|last=Disability Rights Commission|title=Disability Discrimination Act 1995: Code of Practice; Employment and Occupation|year=2004|publisher=The Stationery Office|isbn=9780117034198|pages=5}}</ref>\n\n===Low floor===\n{{redirect|Low floor|more details|Low-floor bus|and|Low-floor tram}}\nA significant development in transportation, and [[public transport]] in particular, to achieve accessibility, is the move to \"low-floor\" vehicles. In a low-floor vehicle, access to part or all of the passenger cabin is unobstructed from one or more entrances by the presence of steps, enabling easier access for the infirm or people with [[Baby transport|push chairs]]. A further aspect may be that the entrance and corridors are wide enough to accommodate a wheelchair. Low-floor vehicles have been developed for [[bus]]es, [[trolleybus]]es and [[trams]].\n\nA low floor in the vehicular sense is normally combined in a conceptual meaning with normal pedestrian access from a standard [[Curb (road)|kerb (curb)]] height. However, the accessibility of a low-floor vehicle can also be utilised from slightly raising portions of kerb at [[bus stop]]s, or through use of level boarding [[bus rapid transit]] stations or tram stops.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.itdp.org/library/standards-and-guides/the-bus-rapid-transit-standard/what-is-brt/|title=What is BRT? - Institute for Transportation and Development Policy|work=Institute for Transportation and Development Policy|access-date=2018-07-02|language=en-US}}</ref> The combination of access from a kerb was the technological development of the 1990s, as step-free interior layouts for buses had existed in some cases for decades, with entrance steps being introduced as chassis designs and overall height regulations changed.\n\nLow-floor buses may also be designed with special height adjustment controls that permit a stationary bus to temporarily lower itself to ground level, permitting wheelchair access. This is referred to as a [[kneeling bus]].\n\nAt [[rapid transit]] systems, vehicles generally have floors in the same height as the platforms but the stations are often underground or elevated, so accessibility there isn't a question of providing low-floor vehicles, but providing a step-free access from street level to the platforms (generally by [[elevator]]s, which are somewhat restricted to disabled passengers only, so that the step-free access isn't obstructed by healthy people taking advantage).\n\n===Accessibility planning for transportation in the United Kingdom===\nIn the [[United Kingdom]], local transport authorities are responsible for checking that all people who live within their area can access essential opportunities and services, and where gaps in provision are identified the local authorities are responsible for organizing changes to make new connections. These requirements are defined in the UK Community Planning Acts legislation<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://theknowledgeexchangeblog.com/2017/01/25/community-planning-in-the-devolved-uk/|title=Community planning in the devolved UK|date=2017-01-25|work=The Knowledge Exchange Blog|access-date=2018-07-02|language=en-US}}</ref> and more detailed guidance has been issued by the [[Department for Transport]] for each [[Local authority#England|local authority]]. This includes the requirement to produce an Accessibility Plan under Community Planning legislation and to incorporate this within their [[Local Transport Plan]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.plymouth.gov.uk/parkingandtravel/transportplansandprojects/localtransportplan|title=Local Transport Plan {{!}} PLYMOUTH.GOV.UK|website=plymouth.gov.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-07-02}}</ref> An Accessibility Plan sets out how each local authority plans to improve access to employment, learning, health care, food shops and other services of local importance, particularly for disadvantaged groups and areas. Accessibility targets are defined in the accessibility plans, these are often the distance or time to access services by different modes of transport including walking, cycling and public transport.\n\nAccessibility Planning was introduced as a result of the report \"Making the Connections: Final Report on Transport and Social Exclusion\".<ref>Office of the Deputy Prime Minister&nbsp;\u2013 Social Exclusion Unit: \"[http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/media/cabinetoffice/social_exclusion_task_force/assets/publications_1997_to_2006/making_transport_2003.pdf Making the Connections: Final Report on Transport and Social Exclusion] {{Webarchive|url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20100907154242/http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/media/cabinetoffice/social_exclusion_task_force/assets/publications_1997_to_2006/making_transport_2003.pdf |date=2010-09-07 }}\". February 2003.</ref> This report was the result of research carried out by the [[Social exclusion|Social Exclusion]] Unit. The United Kingdom also has a \"code of practice\" for making train and stations accessible: \"Accessible Train and Station Design for Disabled People: A Code of Practice\".<ref>Department of Transport & Transport Scotland: \"[http://www.dft.gov.uk/transportforyou/access/rail/railstations/accessiblestationdesigns/cop.pdf Accessible Train and Station Design for Disabled People: A Code of Practice]\". July 2008.</ref> This code of practice was first published in 2002 with the objective of compliance to Section 71B of the Railways Act 1993,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1993/43/section/71B|title=Railways Act 1993|website=legislation.gov.uk|language=en|others=Expert Participation|access-date=2018-07-02}}</ref> and revised after a public consultation period in 2008.\n\nMaking public services fully accessible to the public has led to some technological innovations. [[Public announcement]] systems using [[audio induction loop]] technology can broadcast announcements directly into the hearing aid of anyone with a hearing impairment, making them useful in such public places as auditoriums and train stations. Australia's government has supported the creation of the [[National Public Toilet Map]], to enable users to locate public toilet facilities throughout the country.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://toiletmap.gov.au/|title=National Public Toilet Map - Home|last=Map|first=National Public Toilet|website=toiletmap.gov.au|language=en|access-date=2018-07-02}}</ref> [[GPS]] is also included as a feature. The service assists people with continence issues, which is estimated to be up to 18% of the population, including the elderly and families with young children.\n\n====Accessibility in urban design====\nAccessibility modifications to conventional urban environments has become common in recent decades. The use of a [[curb cut]], or [[kassel kerb]], to enable wheelchair or walker movement between sidewalk and street level is found in most major cities of wealthy countries. The creation of priority parking spaces and of [[disabled parking permit]]s has made them a standard feature of urban environments. Features that assist people with visual impairments include [[braille]] signs and [[tactile paving]] to allow a user with a cane to easily identify stairways, train platforms, and similar areas that could pose a physical danger to anyone who has a visual impairment.\n\nUrban design features that may appear to be simple conveniences for persons without disabilities are often essential to anyone who has a disability. The loss of these features presents a significant barrier. For example, sometimes a lack of prompt snow-clearing on sidewalks of major Canadian city streets means that wheelchair and walker users cannot reach pedestrian crossing buttons on crosswalk posts, due to snow bank accumulation around the posts, making the crossing buttons inaccessible. Public services must take into account the need to maintain accessibility features in the urban environment.\n\n==Housing==\n{{Further|Accessible housing}}\nMost existing and new housing, even in the wealthiest nations, lack basic accessibility features unless the designated, immediate occupant of a home currently has a disability. However, there are some initiatives to change typical residential practices so that new homes incorporate basic access features such as zero-step entries and door widths adequate for wheelchairs to pass through. [[Occupational Therapist]]s are a professional group skilled in the assessment and making of recommendations to improve access to homes.<ref>Occupational therapy research on assistive technology and physical environmental issues: A literature review, Fange et al. (2006), Canadian Journal of Occupational Therapy</ref> They are involved in both the adaptation of existing housing to improve accessibility,<ref>Changes in accessibility and usability in housing: an exploration of the housing adaptation process (2005), Fange and Iwarsson, Occupational Therapy International</ref> and in the design of future housing.<ref>Accessibility and usability in housing: construct validity and implications for research and practice (2003), Fange and Iwarsson, Disability and Rehabilitation</ref>\n\nThe broad concept of [[Universal design]] is relevant to housing, as it is to all aspects of the built environment. Furthermore, a [[Visitability]] movement<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wbdg.org/resources/visitability|title=Visitability {{!}} WBDG Whole Building Design Guide|website=wbdg.org|language=en|access-date=2018-07-02}}</ref> begun by grass roots disability advocates in the 1980s focuses specifically on changing construction practices in new housing. This movement, a network of interested people working in their locales, works on educating, passing laws, and spurring voluntary home access initiatives with the intention that basic access become a routine part of new home construction.\n\n===Accessibility and 'ageing in place'===\nAccessibility in the design of housing and household devices has become more prominent in recent decades due to a rapidly ageing population in developed countries.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.disabled-world.com/disability/accessibility/homes/|title=Accessible Home Design: Information & Ideas|work=Disabled World|access-date=2018-07-02|language=en-US}}</ref> Ageing seniors may wish to continue living independently, but the ageing process naturally increases the disabilities that a senior citizen will experience. A growing trend is the desire for many senior citizens to 'age in place', living as independently as possible for as long as possible. Accessibility modifications that allow ageing in place are becoming more common. Housing may even be designed to incorporate accessibility modifications that can be made throughout the life cycle of the residents.\n\n==Voting==\n\nUnder the [[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]], states parties are bound to assure accessible [[election]]s, [[voting]], and voting procedures. In 2018, the United Nations [[Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]] issued an opinion that all polling stations should be fully accessible. At the [[European Court of Human Rights]], there are currently two ongoing cases about the accessibility of polling places and voting procedures. They were brought against [[Slovenia]] by two voters and the [[Slovenian Disability Rights Association]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://english.sta.si/2717030/disabled-take-slovenia-to-human-rights-court-over-polling-stations-accessibility|title=STA: Disabled take Slovenia to Human Rights Court over polling stations accessibility|website=english.sta.si|access-date=2020-01-14}}</ref> As of January 2020, the cases, called Toplak v.

Access to the technology is restricted to those who can afford it, but it has become more widespread in Western countries in recent years. For those who use it, it provides the ability to access information and services by minimizing the barriers of distance and cost as well as the accessibility and usability of the interface. In many countries this has led to initiatives, laws and/or regulations that aim toward providing universal access to the internet and to phone systems at reasonable cost to citizens.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.w3.org/WAI/users/browsing.html |title=Better Web Browsing: Tips for Customizing Your Computer|publisher=World Wide Web Consortium}}</ref>\n\nA major advantage of advanced technology is its flexibility. Some technologies can be used at home, in the workplace, and in school, expanding the ability of the user to participate in various spheres of daily life. [[Augmentative and alternative communication]] technology is one such area of IT progress. It includes inventions such as [[speech-generating device]]s, [[Teletypewriter]] devices, adaptive pointing devices to replace computer mouse devices, and many others. They can be adapted to create accessibility to a range of tasks, and may be suitable for different kinds of disability.\n\nThe following impairments are some of the disabilities that affect communications and technology access, as well as many other life activities:\n* [[communication disorder]]s;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://health.nih.gov/topic/SpeechCommunicationDisorders|title=Speech and Communication Disorders|publisher=National Institutes of Health}}</ref>\n* [[hearing impairment]]s;<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/hearingdisordersanddeafness.html|title=Hearing Disorders and Deafness|publisher=National Library of Medicine}}</ref>\n* [[visual impairment]]s;<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/visionimpairmentandblindness.html|title=Visual Impairment and Blindness|publisher=National Library of Medicine}}</ref>\n* [[mobility impairment]]s;\n* a [[learning disability]] or impairment in mental functioning.\n\nEach kind of disability requires a different kind of accommodation, and this may require analysis by a medical specialist, an educational specialist or a job analysis when the impairment requires accommodation.\n* [[Job analysis]]<ref>{{cite journal|pmc=2538128|title=Pre-employment and periodical health examinations, job analysis and placement of workers| pmid=13276805|volume=13|issue=4|year=1955|journal=Bull.

Quadriplegics have the most profound disability, and the voice operated wheel chair technology was first developed in 1977 to provide increased mobility. The original version replaced the joystick system with a module that recognized 8 commands. Many other technology accommodation improvements have evolved from this initial development.<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=849131|title=Voice Operated Wheelchair| volume=58|issue=4|date=April 1977|journal=Arch Phys Med Rehabil|pages=169\u201375|last1=Clark|first1=J. A.|last2=Roemer|first2=R. B.}}</ref>\n\nMissing arms and fingers interferes with the use of a keyboard and pointing device (mouse). This can be one of the most devastating types of handicap, and technology has made great improvements in this area during the last 20 years. Speech recognition devices and software can improve technology access.\n\n====Communication (including speech) impairments====\nA communication disorder interferes with the ability to produce clearly understandable speech. There can be many different causes, such as nerve degeneration, muscle degeneration, stroke, and vocal cord injury. The modern method to deal with speaking disabilities has been to provide a text interface for a speech synthesizer for complete vocal disability. This can be a great improvement for people that have been limited to the use of a throat vibrator to produce speech since the 1960s.\n\n====Hearing impairment====\nAn individual satisfies the definition of hearing disabled when hearing loss is about 30&nbsp;dB for a single frequency, but this is not always perceptible as a handicap.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.hear-it.org/Defining-hearing-loss|title=Definition of hearing loss \u2013 Mild, Moderate, Severe & Profound - hear-it.org|access-date=2018-07-02}}</ref> For example, loss of sensitivity in one ear interferes with sound localization (directional hearing), which can interfere with communication in a crowd. This is often recognized when certain words are confused during normal conversation. This can interfere with voice-only interfaces, like automated customer service telephone systems, because it is sometimes difficult to increase the volume and repeat the message.\n\nMild to moderate hearing loss may be accommodated with a hearing aid that amplifies ambient sounds. Portable devices with speed recognition that can produce text can reduce problems associated with understanding conversation. This kind of hearing loss is relatively common, and this often grows worse with age.\n\nThe modern method to deal with profound hearing disability is the Internet using email or word processing applications. The [[telecommunications device for the deaf]] (TDD) became available in the form of the [[Teleprinter|teletype]] (TTY) during the 1960s. These devices consist of a keyboard, display and modem that connects two or more of these devices using a dedicated wire or plain old telephone service.\n\n====Visual impairments====\nA wide range of technology products are available to deal with visual impairment. This includes screen magnification for monitors, screen-reading technology for computers and small screen devices, mouse-over speech synthesis browsing, braille displays, braille printers, braille cameras, voice-operated phones, and tablets.\n\nOne emerging product that will make ordinary computer displays available for the blind is the refreshable tactile display, which is very different from a conventional braille display. This provides a raised surface corresponding to the bright and dim spots on a conventional display. An example is the Touch Sight Camera for the Blind.\n\n[[Speech Synthesis Markup Language]] ''(V1.0 Released 7 September 2004<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-speech-synthesis-20040907/|title=Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) Version 1.0|website=w3.org}}</ref>)'' and [[Speech Recognition Grammar Specification]] ''(V1.0 released 16 March 2004<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.w3.org/TR/speech-grammar/|title=Speech Recognition Grammar Specification Version 1.0|website=w3.org}}</ref>)'' are relatively recent technologies intended to standardize communication interfaces using Augmented [[Backus\u2013Naur form|BNF]] Form and [[XML]] Form. These technologies assist visual impairments and physical impairment by providing interactive access to web content without the need to visually observe the content. While these technologies provides access for visually impaired individuals, the primary benefactor has been automated systems that replace live human customer service representatives that handle telephone calls.\n\n===Web accessibility===\n{{See also |Web accessibility}}\n\n====International standards and guidelines====\nThere have been a few major movements to coordinate a set of guidelines for accessibility for the [[World Wide Web|web]]. The first and most well known is The [[Web Accessibility Initiative]] (WAI), which is part of the World Wide Web Consortium ([[W3C]]). This organization developed the [[Web Content Accessibility Guidelines]] (WCAG) 1.0 and 2.0 which explain how to make Web content accessible to everyone, including people with disabilities. Web \"content\" generally refers to the information in a Web page or Web application, including text, images, forms, and sounds. (More specific definitions are available in the WCAG documents.)<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.w3.org/WAI/gettingstarted/Overview.html |title=WAI Resources on Introducing Web Accessibility | publisher=[[W3C]] | work=[[Web Accessibility Initiative]] | accessdate=18 June 2014 }}</ref>\n\nThe WCAG is separated into three levels of compliance, A, AA and AAA. Each level requires a stricter set of conformance guidelines, such as different versions of [[HTML]] (Transitional vs Strict) and other techniques that need to be incorporated into coding before accomplishing validation. Online tools allow users to submit their website and automatically run it through the WCAG guidelines and produce a report, stating whether or not they conform to each level of compliance. [[Adobe Dreamweaver]] also offers plugins which allow web developers to test these guidelines on their work from within the program.\n\nThe [[ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 36#WG 7 Culture.2C Language.2C and Human Functioning Activities|ISO/IEC JTC1 SC36 WG7]] 24751 Individualized Adaptability and Accessibility in e-learning, education and training series is freely available and made of 3 parts: Individualized Adaptability and Accessibility in e-learning, education and training, Standards inventory and Guidance on user needs mapping.\n\nAnother source of web accessibility guidance comes from the [[US government]]. In response to [[Rehabilitation Act of 1973#Section 508|Section 508 of the US Rehabilitation Act]], the Access Board developed standards to which U.S. federal agencies must comply in order to make their sites accessible. The U.S. General Services Administration has developed a website where one can take online training courses for free to learn about these rules.<ref>Section 508: [http://www.section508.gov/index.cfm?FuseAction=Content&ID=5 508 Training].</ref>\n\n====Web accessibility features====\nExamples of accessibility features include:\n\n* [[Web Accessibility Initiative|WAI]]-AA compliance with the [[Web Content Accessibility Guidelines|WAI's WCAG]]\n* [[Semantic HTML|Semantic]] Web markup\n* (X)HTML Validation from the W3C for the pages content\n* CSS Validation from the W3C for the pages layout\n* Compliance with all guidelines from Section 508 of the US Rehabilitation Act\n* A high contrast version of the site for individuals with low vision, and a low contrast (yellow or blue) version of the site for individuals with dyslexia\n* Alternative media for any multimedia used on the site (video, flash, audio, etc.)\n* Simple and consistent navigation\n* Device independent\n\nWhile WCAG provides much technical information for use by web designers, coders and editors, ''BS 8878:2010 Web accessibility \u2013 Code of Practice''<ref>[http://www.hassellinclusion.com/bs8878/ BS 8878:2010 Web accessibility \u2013 Code of Practice].</ref> has been introduced, initially in the UK, to help site owners and product managers to understand the importance of accessibility. It includes advice on the business case behind accessibility, and how organisations might usefully update their policies and production processes to embed accessibility in their business-as-usual. On 28 May 2019, BS 8878 was superseded by ''ISO 30071-1'',<ref>[https://www.hassellinclusion.com/iso-30071-1/ ISO 30071-1].</ref> the international Standard that built on BS 8878 and expanded it for international use.\n\nAnother useful idea is for websites to include a web accessibility statement on the site. Initially introduced in PAS 78,<ref>[http://www.equalityhumanrights.com/footer/accessibility-statement/general-web-accessibility-guidance/ PAS 78].</ref> the best practice for web accessibility statements has been updated in BS 8878<ref>[http://www.hassellinclusion.com/bs8878/ BS 8878].</ref> to emphasise the inclusion of: information on how disabled and elderly people could get a better experience of using the website by using assistive technologies or accessibility settings of browsers and operating systems (linking to \"BBC My Web My Way\"<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/accessibility/ BBC My Web My Way], [[BBC]], UK.</ref> can be useful here); information on what accessibility features the site's creators have included, and if there are any user needs which the site doesn't currently support (for example, descriptive video to allow blind people to access the information in videos more easily); and contact details for disabled people to be able to use to let the site creators know if they have any problems in using the site. While validations against WCAG, and other accessibility badges can also be included, they should be put lower down the statement, as most disabled people still do not understand these technical terms.<ref>[http://www.hassellinclusion.com/accessibility/ Example of an accessibility statement written by the lead-author of BS 8878].</ref>\n\n==Education and accessibility for students==\n[[File:Vietnam phusical therapy school orphanage.jpg|thumb|upright|A teacher helps her student at an orphanage in central [[Vietnam]]. The orphanage caters to many abandoned and disabled children \u2013 through education and communication programs they are able to have a life that would otherwise not be possible.]]\n[[File:Latrine ramp school.jpg|thumb|Construction of a ramp for a school latrine in Ukunda, Kenya, making the school building more accessible to students with disabilities.]]\nEqual access to education for students with disabilities is supported in some countries by legislation. It is still challenging for some students with disabilities to fully participate in mainstream education settings, but many adaptive technologies and assistive programs are making improvements. In India, the [[Medical Council of India]] has now passed the directives to all the medical institutions to make them accessible to persons with disabilities. This happened due to a petition by Dr Satendra Singh founder of [[Infinite Ability]].<ref>{{cite news|title=MCI asks all medical institutions to be 'accessible'|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/mci-asks-all-medical-institutions-to-be-accessible/article4628862.ece|accessdate=21 April 2013|newspaper=The Hindu|date=18 April 2013}}</ref>\n\nStudents with a physical or mental impairment or learning disability may require note-taking assistance, which may be provided by a business offering such services, as with tutoring services. Talking books in the form of talking textbooks are available in Canadian secondary and post-secondary schools. Also, students may require adaptive technology to access computers and the Internet. These may be tax-exempt expenses in some jurisdictions with a medical prescription.\n\n===Test accessibility===\nTest accessibility is defined as the extent to which a test and its constituent item set eliminates barriers and permits the test-taker to demonstrate his or her knowledge of the tested content.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} Test accessibility involves an interaction between features of the test and individual test-taker characteristics.\n\nWith the passage of the [[No Child Left Behind Act]] of 2001 in the United States,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.edweek.org/ew/section/multimedia/no-child-left-behind-overview-definition-summary.html|title=No Child Left Behind Overview: Definitions, Requirements, Criticisms, and More|work=Education Week|access-date=2018-07-02|language=en-US}}</ref> student accountability in essential content areas such as reading, mathematics, and science has become a major area of focus in educational reform.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www2.ed.gov/nclb/overview/intro/execsumm.html|title=Executive Summary of the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001|date=2007-11-20|website=www2.ed.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-07-02}}</ref> As a result, test developers have needed to create tests to ensure all students, including those with special needs (e.g., students identified with disabilities), are given the opportunity to demonstrate the extent to which they have mastered the content measured on state assessments. Currently, states are permitted to develop two different types of tests in addition to the standard grade-level assessments to target students with special needs. First, the alternate assessment may be used to report proficiency for up to 1% of students in a state. Second, new regulations permit the use of alternate assessments based on modified academic achievement standards to report proficiency for up to 2% of students in a state.\n\nTo ensure these new tests generate results that permit valid inferences about student performance, they must be accessible to as many individuals as possible. The Test Accessibility and Modification Inventory (TAMI)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://peabody.vanderbilt.edu/tami.xml |title=Peabody College of Education and Human Development &#124; Vanderbilt University |publisher=Peabody.vanderbilt.edu |date=2012-07-30 |accessdate=2012-08-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927114520/http://peabody.vanderbilt.edu/tami.xml |archive-date=2011-09-27 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and its companion evaluation tool, the Accessibility Rating Matrix (ARM), were designed to facilitate the evaluation of tests and test items with a focus on enhancing their accessibility. Both instruments integrate principles of accessibility theory and were guided by research on universal design, assessment accessibility, cognitive load theory, and research on item-writing and test development.

Workers in Western countries fare relatively well, having access to more services and training as well as legal protections against employment discrimination.

This translates into an earnings gap where individuals with disabilities earn about 25 percent less of what workers without disabilities earn. Among occupations with 100,000 or more people, dishwashers had the highest disability rate (14.3%), followed by refuse and recyclable material collectors (12.7%), personal care aides (11.9%), and janitors and building cleaners (11.8%).

Some workplaces have policies in place to provide \"reasonable accommodation\" for employees with disabilities, however, many do not. In some jurisdictions, employers may have legal requirements to end [[ableism|discrimination against persons with disabilities]].\n\nIt has been noted by researchers that where accommodations are in place for employees with disabilities, these frequently apply to individuals with \"pre-determined or apparent disabilities as determined by national social protection or Equality Authorities\",<ref name=\"Geisen165\">{{cite book|author1=Geisen, Thomas |author2=Henry George Harder|title=Disability Management and Workplace Integration: International Research Findings|year=2011|publisher=Gower Publishing|isbn=9781409418887|pages=165}}</ref> which include persons with pre-existing conditions who receive an official disability designation. One of the biggest challenges for employers is in developing policies and practises to manage employees who develop disabilities during the course of employment. Even where these exist, they tend to focus on workplace injuries, overlooking job retention challenges faced by employees who acquire a non-occupation injury or illness.

Such an approach neglects the influence of interventions in the transport system on broader and often conflicting economic, social and environmental goals. Accessibility based planning defines accessibility as the amount of services and jobs people can access within a certain travel time, considering one or more modes of transport such as walking, cycling, driving or public transport.\nUsing this definition accessibility does not only relate to the qualities of the transport system (e.g. travel speed, time or costs), but also to the qualities of the land use system (e.g. densities and mixes of opportunities). It thus provides planners with the possibility to understand interdependencies between transport and land use development. Accessibility planning opens the floor to a more normative approach to transportation planning involving different actors.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.plan4sustainabletravel.org/key_themes/accessibility_key_features/|title=Planning for Sustainable Travel - Key Themes - Accessibility of Key Facilities|website=plan4sustainabletravel.org|access-date=2018-07-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180208070132/http://www.plan4sustainabletravel.org/key_themes/accessibility_key_features/|archive-date=2018-02-08|url-status=dead}}</ref> For politicians, citizens and firms it might be easier to discuss the quality of access to education, services and markets than it is to discuss the inefficiencies of the transport system itself. Accessibility is also defined as \"the potential for interaction\".\n\n===Accessibility instruments===\nGenerally since the 1960s, accessibility instruments have been developed for a multitude of contexts and scopes. These instruments have their focus on origins and on destinations, they measure access through time, distance or cost and focus on different modes of transportation and geographical scales. Accessibility instruments are thus able to show what are the best accessible places or opportunities within a city or region, considering one or more specific modes of transportation, timeslots and target groups. In addition to this, the maps, which are produced as the instrument output, are considered as considerably useful when assessing the effects of new developments in a city. The first ever first large scale compendium of accessibility instruments was developed in 2012, under the framework of Cost Action TU1002, and is available.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.accessibilityplanning.eu/accessibility-instruments-2/|title=Accessibility Instruments|website=accessibilityplanning.eu}}</ref>\n\n===Potentials of accessibility in planning practice===\nDespite the high potential of accessibility in integrating the different components of urban planning, such as land use and transportation and the large number of accessibility instruments available in the research literature, the latter are not widely used to support urban planning practices.<ref>{{cite book |title=Accessibility Instruments for Planning Practice|date=June 2012|publisher=COST Office|isbn=978-989-20-3210-8 |author1=Angela Hull |author2=Cec\u00edlia Silva |author3=Luca Bertolini |url=http://www.accessibilityplanning.eu/wp-content/uploads/2012/10/COST-Report-1-FINAL.pdf}}</ref> By keeping the accessibility language out of the practice level, older paradigms resist the more informed and people-centred approaches.\nFocusing on the link between research and practice, the Cost Action TU1002 <ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.tut.fi/edge/?page_id=182|title=COST Action TU1002 {{!}} EDGE|website=tut.fi|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-02}}</ref> seeks to find out why accessibility instruments are not more often used in urban planning practice and reflects on how to reduce such implementation gap in planning practice. The existence of accessibility instruments is fairly acknowledged, but practitioners do not appear to have found them useful or usable enough for addressing the tasks of sustainable urban management.\nThis Cost Action TU1002 is bringing together developers of accessibility instruments all over Europe and Australia to work with land use and transportation planning practitioners to explore how these instruments can play a more supportive role in enhancing accessibility in European cities and beyond. So far, 24 Accessibility Instruments have been gathered, analysed and described so as to understand in detail their characteristics, planning issues addressed and specific purposes, according to the developers\u2019 view. In turn, these instruments are being tested in a series of workshops with multidisciplinary teams of practitioners around Europe addressing the issue of usability from the practitioners\u2019 viewpoint. In doing so, it is expected that the additional knowledge on the potential of accessibility instruments for urban planning practice will have beneficial impacts on urban quality and decision making on urban land use patterns.\n\n==Transportation==\n{{for|the metric of transport connectivity for planning purposes|Accessibility (transport)}}\n[[File:Curitiba 10 2006 04 RIT.jpg|alt=ramps lowered from the side of a bus are level with the station's high platform|thumb|Accessibility to all [[autobus|buses]] is provided in [[Curitiba]]'s [[Rede Integrada de Transporte|public transport]] system, [[Brazil]].]]\n[[File:\u53f0\u5317\u8eca\u7ad9\u7121\u969c\u7919\u96fb\u68af.jpg|thumb|An [[elevator]] at [[Taipei Railway Station]] allowing for wheelchair access.]]\n[[File:Taxi wheelchair.jpg|thumb|A wheelchair accessible [[taxi]] with a rear ramp, [[Tokyo Motor Show]] 2009.]]\n[[File:Protram205 ramp.JPG|thumb|[[Wheelchair ramp|Wheelchair-access ramp]] in [[Protram 205 WrAs]] tram.]]\nProviding mobility to people with disabilities includes changes for public facilities like gently sloping paths of travel for people with wheelchairs and difficulty walking up stairs, or audio announcements for the blind; dedicated services like [[paratransit]]; and adaptations to personal vehicles.\n\n===Adapted automobiles for persons with disabilities===\n{{See also|Adapted automobile}}\nAutomobile accessibility also refers to ease of use by disabled people.

[[Ergonomic]] adaptations, such as a lumbar support cushion, may also be needed.<ref>{{cite book|last=Dimond|first=Bridget C.|title=Legal Aspects of Physiotherapy|year=2009|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=9781405176156|pages=[https://archive.org/details/legalaspectsofph0000dimo/page/263 263]|url=https://archive.org/details/legalaspectsofph0000dimo/page/263}}</ref>\n\nGenerally, the more limiting the disability, the more expensive the adaptation needed for the vehicle. Financial assistance is available through some organizations, such as [[Motability]] in the United Kingdom, which requires a contribution by the prospective vehicle owner. Motability makes vehicles available for purchase or lease.<ref>{{cite book|last=Dimond|first=Bridget C.|title=Legal Aspects of Occupational Therapy|year=2011|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=9781444348163|pages=n.p}}</ref>\n\nWhen an employee with a disability requires an adapted car for work use, the employee does not have to pay for a \"[[reasonable accommodation|reasonable adjustment]]\" in the United Kingdom; if the employer is unable to pay the cost, assistance is offered by government programs.<ref>{{cite book|last=Disability Rights Commission|title=Disability Discrimination Act 1995: Code of Practice; Employment and Occupation|year=2004|publisher=The Stationery Office|isbn=9780117034198|pages=5}}</ref>\n\n===Low floor===\n{{redirect|Low floor|more details|Low-floor bus|and|Low-floor tram}}\nA significant development in transportation, and [[public transport]] in particular, to achieve accessibility, is the move to \"low-floor\" vehicles. In a low-floor vehicle, access to part or all of the passenger cabin is unobstructed from one or more entrances by the presence of steps, enabling easier access for the infirm or people with [[Baby transport|push chairs]]. A further aspect may be that the entrance and corridors are wide enough to accommodate a wheelchair. Low-floor vehicles have been developed for [[bus]]es, [[trolleybus]]es and [[trams]].\n\nA low floor in the vehicular sense is normally combined in a conceptual meaning with normal pedestrian access from a standard [[Curb (road)|kerb (curb)]] height. However, the accessibility of a low-floor vehicle can also be utilised from slightly raising portions of kerb at [[bus stop]]s, or through use of level boarding [[bus rapid transit]] stations or tram stops.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.itdp.org/library/standards-and-guides/the-bus-rapid-transit-standard/what-is-brt/|title=What is BRT? - Institute for Transportation and Development Policy|work=Institute for Transportation and Development Policy|access-date=2018-07-02|language=en-US}}</ref> The combination of access from a kerb was the technological development of the 1990s, as step-free interior layouts for buses had existed in some cases for decades, with entrance steps being introduced as chassis designs and overall height regulations changed.\n\nLow-floor buses may also be designed with special height adjustment controls that permit a stationary bus to temporarily lower itself to ground level, permitting wheelchair access. This is referred to as a [[kneeling bus]].\n\nAt [[rapid transit]] systems, vehicles generally have floors in the same height as the platforms but the stations are often underground or elevated, so accessibility there isn't a question of providing low-floor vehicles, but providing a step-free access from street level to the platforms (generally by [[elevator]]s, which are somewhat restricted to disabled passengers only, so that the step-free access isn't obstructed by healthy people taking advantage).\n\n===Accessibility planning for transportation in the United Kingdom===\nIn the [[United Kingdom]], local transport authorities are responsible for checking that all people who live within their area can access essential opportunities and services, and where gaps in provision are identified the local authorities are responsible for organizing changes to make new connections. These requirements are defined in the UK Community Planning Acts legislation<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://theknowledgeexchangeblog.com/2017/01/25/community-planning-in-the-devolved-uk/|title=Community planning in the devolved UK|date=2017-01-25|work=The Knowledge Exchange Blog|access-date=2018-07-02|language=en-US}}</ref> and more detailed guidance has been issued by the [[Department for Transport]] for each [[Local authority#England|local authority]]. This includes the requirement to produce an Accessibility Plan under Community Planning legislation and to incorporate this within their [[Local Transport Plan]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.plymouth.gov.uk/parkingandtravel/transportplansandprojects/localtransportplan|title=Local Transport Plan {{!}} PLYMOUTH.GOV.UK|website=plymouth.gov.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-07-02}}</ref> An Accessibility Plan sets out how each local authority plans to improve access to employment, learning, health care, food shops and other services of local importance, particularly for disadvantaged groups and areas. Accessibility targets are defined in the accessibility plans, these are often the distance or time to access services by different modes of transport including walking, cycling and public transport.\n\nAccessibility Planning was introduced as a result of the report \"Making the Connections: Final Report on Transport and Social Exclusion\".<ref>Office of the Deputy Prime Minister&nbsp;\u2013 Social Exclusion Unit: \"[http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/media/cabinetoffice/social_exclusion_task_force/assets/publications_1997_to_2006/making_transport_2003.pdf Making the Connections: Final Report on Transport and Social Exclusion] {{Webarchive|url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20100907154242/http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/media/cabinetoffice/social_exclusion_task_force/assets/publications_1997_to_2006/making_transport_2003.pdf |date=2010-09-07 }}\". February 2003.</ref> This report was the result of research carried out by the [[Social exclusion|Social Exclusion]] Unit. The United Kingdom also has a \"code of practice\" for making train and stations accessible: \"Accessible Train and Station Design for Disabled People: A Code of Practice\".<ref>Department of Transport & Transport Scotland: \"[http://www.dft.gov.uk/transportforyou/access/rail/railstations/accessiblestationdesigns/cop.pdf Accessible Train and Station Design for Disabled People: A Code of Practice]\". July 2008.</ref> This code of practice was first published in 2002 with the objective of compliance to Section 71B of the Railways Act 1993,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1993/43/section/71B|title=Railways Act 1993|website=legislation.gov.uk|language=en|others=Expert Participation|access-date=2018-07-02}}</ref> and revised after a public consultation period in 2008.\n\nMaking public services fully accessible to the public has led to some technological innovations. [[Public announcement]] systems using [[audio induction loop]] technology can broadcast announcements directly into the hearing aid of anyone with a hearing impairment, making them useful in such public places as auditoriums and train stations. Australia's government has supported the creation of the [[National Public Toilet Map]], to enable users to locate public toilet facilities throughout the country.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://toiletmap.gov.au/|title=National Public Toilet Map - Home|last=Map|first=National Public Toilet|website=toiletmap.gov.au|language=en|access-date=2018-07-02}}</ref> [[GPS]] is also included as a feature. The service assists people with continence issues, which is estimated to be up to 18% of the population, including the elderly and families with young children.\n\n====Accessibility in urban design====\nAccessibility modifications to conventional urban environments has become common in recent decades. The use of a [[curb cut]], or [[kassel kerb]], to enable wheelchair or walker movement between sidewalk and street level is found in most major cities of wealthy countries. The creation of priority parking spaces and of [[disabled parking permit]]s has made them a standard feature of urban environments. Features that assist people with visual impairments include [[braille]] signs and [[tactile paving]] to allow a user with a cane to easily identify stairways, train platforms, and similar areas that could pose a physical danger to anyone who has a visual impairment.\n\nUrban design features that may appear to be simple conveniences for persons without disabilities are often essential to anyone who has a disability. The loss of these features presents a significant barrier. For example, sometimes a lack of prompt snow-clearing on sidewalks of major Canadian city streets means that wheelchair and walker users cannot reach pedestrian crossing buttons on crosswalk posts, due to snow bank accumulation around the posts, making the crossing buttons inaccessible. Public services must take into account the need to maintain accessibility features in the urban environment.\n\n==Housing==\n{{Further|Accessible housing}}\nMost existing and new housing, even in the wealthiest nations, lack basic accessibility features unless the designated, immediate occupant of a home currently has a disability. However, there are some initiatives to change typical residential practices so that new homes incorporate basic access features such as zero-step entries and door widths adequate for wheelchairs to pass through. [[Occupational Therapist]]s are a professional group skilled in the assessment and making of recommendations to improve access to homes.<ref>Occupational therapy research on assistive technology and physical environmental issues: A literature review, Fange et al. (2006), Canadian Journal of Occupational Therapy</ref> They are involved in both the adaptation of existing housing to improve accessibility,<ref>Changes in accessibility and usability in housing: an exploration of the housing adaptation process (2005), Fange and Iwarsson, Occupational Therapy International</ref> and in the design of future housing.<ref>Accessibility and usability in housing: construct validity and implications for research and practice (2003), Fange and Iwarsson, Disability and Rehabilitation</ref>\n\nThe broad concept of [[Universal design]] is relevant to housing, as it is to all aspects of the built environment. Furthermore, a [[Visitability]] movement<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.wbdg.org/resources/visitability|title=Visitability {{!}} WBDG Whole Building Design Guide|website=wbdg.org|language=en|access-date=2018-07-02}}</ref> begun by grass roots disability advocates in the 1980s focuses specifically on changing construction practices in new housing. This movement, a network of interested people working in their locales, works on educating, passing laws, and spurring voluntary home access initiatives with the intention that basic access become a routine part of new home construction.\n\n===Accessibility and 'ageing in place'===\nAccessibility in the design of housing and household devices has become more prominent in recent decades due to a rapidly ageing population in developed countries.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.disabled-world.com/disability/accessibility/homes/|title=Accessible Home Design: Information & Ideas|work=Disabled World|access-date=2018-07-02|language=en-US}}</ref> Ageing seniors may wish to continue living independently, but the ageing process naturally increases the disabilities that a senior citizen will experience. A growing trend is the desire for many senior citizens to 'age in place', living as independently as possible for as long as possible. Accessibility modifications that allow ageing in place are becoming more common. Housing may even be designed to incorporate accessibility modifications that can be made throughout the life cycle of the residents.\n\n==Voting==\n\nUnder the [[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]], states parties are bound to assure accessible [[election]]s, [[voting]], and voting procedures. In 2018, the United Nations [[Committee on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]] issued an opinion that all polling stations should be fully accessible. At the [[European Court of Human Rights]], there are currently two ongoing cases about the accessibility of polling places and voting procedures. They were brought against [[Slovenia]] by two voters and the [[Slovenian Disability Rights Association]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://english.sta.si/2717030/disabled-take-slovenia-to-human-rights-court-over-polling-stations-accessibility|title=STA: Disabled take Slovenia to Human Rights Court over polling stations accessibility|website=english.sta.si|access-date=2020-01-14}}</ref> As of January 2020, the cases, called Toplak v.

Access to the technology is restricted to those who can afford it, but it has become more widespread in Western countries in recent years. For those who use it, it provides the ability to access information and services by minimizing the barriers of distance and cost as well as the accessibility and usability of the interface. In many countries this has led to initiatives, laws and/or regulations that aim toward providing universal access to the internet and to phone systems at reasonable cost to citizens.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.w3.org/WAI/users/browsing.html |title=Better Web Browsing: Tips for Customizing Your Computer|publisher=World Wide Web Consortium}}</ref>\n\nA major advantage of advanced technology is its flexibility. Some technologies can be used at home, in the workplace, and in school, expanding the ability of the user to participate in various spheres of daily life. [[Augmentative and alternative communication]] technology is one such area of IT progress. It includes inventions such as [[speech-generating device]]s, [[Teletypewriter]] devices, adaptive pointing devices to replace computer mouse devices, and many others. They can be adapted to create accessibility to a range of tasks, and may be suitable for different kinds of disability.\n\nThe following impairments are some of the disabilities that affect communications and technology access, as well as many other life activities:\n* [[communication disorder]]s;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://health.nih.gov/topic/SpeechCommunicationDisorders|title=Speech and Communication Disorders|publisher=National Institutes of Health}}</ref>\n* [[hearing impairment]]s;<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/hearingdisordersanddeafness.html|title=Hearing Disorders and Deafness|publisher=National Library of Medicine}}</ref>\n* [[visual impairment]]s;<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/visionimpairmentandblindness.html|title=Visual Impairment and Blindness|publisher=National Library of Medicine}}</ref>\n* [[mobility impairment]]s;\n* a [[learning disability]] or impairment in mental functioning.\n\nEach kind of disability requires a different kind of accommodation, and this may require analysis by a medical specialist, an educational specialist or a job analysis when the impairment requires accommodation.\n* [[Job analysis]]<ref>{{cite journal|pmc=2538128|title=Pre-employment and periodical health examinations, job analysis and placement of workers| pmid=13276805|volume=13|issue=4|year=1955|journal=Bull.

Quadriplegics have the most profound disability, and the voice operated wheel chair technology was first developed in 1977 to provide increased mobility. The original version replaced the joystick system with a module that recognized 8 commands. Many other technology accommodation improvements have evolved from this initial development.<ref>{{cite journal|pmid=849131|title=Voice Operated Wheelchair| volume=58|issue=4|date=April 1977|journal=Arch Phys Med Rehabil|pages=169\u201375|last1=Clark|first1=J. A.|last2=Roemer|first2=R. B.}}</ref>\n\nMissing arms and fingers interferes with the use of a keyboard and pointing device (mouse). This can be one of the most devastating types of handicap, and technology has made great improvements in this area during the last 20 years. Speech recognition devices and software can improve technology access.\n\n====Communication (including speech) impairments====\nA communication disorder interferes with the ability to produce clearly understandable speech. There can be many different causes, such as nerve degeneration, muscle degeneration, stroke, and vocal cord injury. The modern method to deal with speaking disabilities has been to provide a text interface for a speech synthesizer for complete vocal disability. This can be a great improvement for people that have been limited to the use of a throat vibrator to produce speech since the 1960s.\n\n====Hearing impairment====\nAn individual satisfies the definition of hearing disabled when hearing loss is about 30&nbsp;dB for a single frequency, but this is not always perceptible as a handicap.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.hear-it.org/Defining-hearing-loss|title=Definition of hearing loss \u2013 Mild, Moderate, Severe & Profound - hear-it.org|access-date=2018-07-02}}</ref> For example, loss of sensitivity in one ear interferes with sound localization (directional hearing), which can interfere with communication in a crowd. This is often recognized when certain words are confused during normal conversation. This can interfere with voice-only interfaces, like automated customer service telephone systems, because it is sometimes difficult to increase the volume and repeat the message.\n\nMild to moderate hearing loss may be accommodated with a hearing aid that amplifies ambient sounds. Portable devices with speed recognition that can produce text can reduce problems associated with understanding conversation. This kind of hearing loss is relatively common, and this often grows worse with age.\n\nThe modern method to deal with profound hearing disability is the Internet using email or word processing applications. The [[telecommunications device for the deaf]] (TDD) became available in the form of the [[Teleprinter|teletype]] (TTY) during the 1960s. These devices consist of a keyboard, display and modem that connects two or more of these devices using a dedicated wire or plain old telephone service.\n\n====Visual impairments====\nA wide range of technology products are available to deal with visual impairment. This includes screen magnification for monitors, screen-reading technology for computers and small screen devices, mouse-over speech synthesis browsing, braille displays, braille printers, braille cameras, voice-operated phones, and tablets.\n\nOne emerging product that will make ordinary computer displays available for the blind is the refreshable tactile display, which is very different from a conventional braille display. This provides a raised surface corresponding to the bright and dim spots on a conventional display. An example is the Touch Sight Camera for the Blind.\n\n[[Speech Synthesis Markup Language]] ''(V1.0 Released 7 September 2004<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-speech-synthesis-20040907/|title=Speech Synthesis Markup Language (SSML) Version 1.0|website=w3.org}}</ref>)'' and [[Speech Recognition Grammar Specification]] ''(V1.0 released 16 March 2004<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.w3.org/TR/speech-grammar/|title=Speech Recognition Grammar Specification Version 1.0|website=w3.org}}</ref>)'' are relatively recent technologies intended to standardize communication interfaces using Augmented [[Backus\u2013Naur form|BNF]] Form and [[XML]] Form. These technologies assist visual impairments and physical impairment by providing interactive access to web content without the need to visually observe the content. While these technologies provides access for visually impaired individuals, the primary benefactor has been automated systems that replace live human customer service representatives that handle telephone calls.\n\n===Web accessibility===\n{{See also |Web accessibility}}\n\n====International standards and guidelines====\nThere have been a few major movements to coordinate a set of guidelines for accessibility for the [[World Wide Web|web]]. The first and most well known is The [[Web Accessibility Initiative]] (WAI), which is part of the World Wide Web Consortium ([[W3C]]). This organization developed the [[Web Content Accessibility Guidelines]] (WCAG) 1.0 and 2.0 which explain how to make Web content accessible to everyone, including people with disabilities. Web \"content\" generally refers to the information in a Web page or Web application, including text, images, forms, and sounds. (More specific definitions are available in the WCAG documents.)<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.w3.org/WAI/gettingstarted/Overview.html |title=WAI Resources on Introducing Web Accessibility | publisher=[[W3C]] | work=[[Web Accessibility Initiative]] | accessdate=18 June 2014 }}</ref>\n\nThe WCAG is separated into three levels of compliance, A, AA and AAA. Each level requires a stricter set of conformance guidelines, such as different versions of [[HTML]] (Transitional vs Strict) and other techniques that need to be incorporated into coding before accomplishing validation. Online tools allow users to submit their website and automatically run it through the WCAG guidelines and produce a report, stating whether or not they conform to each level of compliance. [[Adobe Dreamweaver]] also offers plugins which allow web developers to test these guidelines on their work from within the program.\n\nThe [[ISO/IEC JTC 1/SC 36#WG 7 Culture.2C Language.2C and Human Functioning Activities|ISO/IEC JTC1 SC36 WG7]] 24751 Individualized Adaptability and Accessibility in e-learning, education and training series is freely available and made of 3 parts: Individualized Adaptability and Accessibility in e-learning, education and training, Standards inventory and Guidance on user needs mapping.\n\nAnother source of web accessibility guidance comes from the [[US government]]. In response to [[Rehabilitation Act of 1973#Section 508|Section 508 of the US Rehabilitation Act]], the Access Board developed standards to which U.S. federal agencies must comply in order to make their sites accessible. The U.S. General Services Administration has developed a website where one can take online training courses for free to learn about these rules.<ref>Section 508: [http://www.section508.gov/index.cfm?FuseAction=Content&ID=5 508 Training].</ref>\n\n====Web accessibility features====\nExamples of accessibility features include:\n\n* [[Web Accessibility Initiative|WAI]]-AA compliance with the [[Web Content Accessibility Guidelines|WAI's WCAG]]\n* [[Semantic HTML|Semantic]] Web markup\n* (X)HTML Validation from the W3C for the pages content\n* CSS Validation from the W3C for the pages layout\n* Compliance with all guidelines from Section 508 of the US Rehabilitation Act\n* A high contrast version of the site for individuals with low vision, and a low contrast (yellow or blue) version of the site for individuals with dyslexia\n* Alternative media for any multimedia used on the site (video, flash, audio, etc.)\n* Simple and consistent navigation\n* Device independent\n\nWhile WCAG provides much technical information for use by web designers, coders and editors, ''BS 8878:2010 Web accessibility \u2013 Code of Practice''<ref>[http://www.hassellinclusion.com/bs8878/ BS 8878:2010 Web accessibility \u2013 Code of Practice].</ref> has been introduced, initially in the UK, to help site owners and product managers to understand the importance of accessibility. It includes advice on the business case behind accessibility, and how organisations might usefully update their policies and production processes to embed accessibility in their business-as-usual. On 28 May 2019, BS 8878 was superseded by ''ISO 30071-1'',<ref>[https://www.hassellinclusion.com/iso-30071-1/ ISO 30071-1].</ref> the international Standard that built on BS 8878 and expanded it for international use.\n\nAnother useful idea is for websites to include a web accessibility statement on the site. Initially introduced in PAS 78,<ref>[http://www.equalityhumanrights.com/footer/accessibility-statement/general-web-accessibility-guidance/ PAS 78].</ref> the best practice for web accessibility statements has been updated in BS 8878<ref>[http://www.hassellinclusion.com/bs8878/ BS 8878].</ref> to emphasise the inclusion of: information on how disabled and elderly people could get a better experience of using the website by using assistive technologies or accessibility settings of browsers and operating systems (linking to \"BBC My Web My Way\"<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/accessibility/ BBC My Web My Way], [[BBC]], UK.</ref> can be useful here); information on what accessibility features the site's creators have included, and if there are any user needs which the site doesn't currently support (for example, descriptive video to allow blind people to access the information in videos more easily); and contact details for disabled people to be able to use to let the site creators know if they have any problems in using the site. While validations against WCAG, and other accessibility badges can also be included, they should be put lower down the statement, as most disabled people still do not understand these technical terms.<ref>[http://www.hassellinclusion.com/accessibility/ Example of an accessibility statement written by the lead-author of BS 8878].</ref>\n\n==Education and accessibility for students==\n[[File:Vietnam phusical therapy school orphanage.jpg|thumb|upright|A teacher helps her student at an orphanage in central [[Vietnam]]. The orphanage caters to many abandoned and disabled children \u2013 through education and communication programs they are able to have a life that would otherwise not be possible.]]\n[[File:Latrine ramp school.jpg|thumb|Construction of a ramp for a school latrine in Ukunda, Kenya, making the school building more accessible to students with disabilities.]]\nEqual access to education for students with disabilities is supported in some countries by legislation. It is still challenging for some students with disabilities to fully participate in mainstream education settings, but many adaptive technologies and assistive programs are making improvements. In India, the [[Medical Council of India]] has now passed the directives to all the medical institutions to make them accessible to persons with disabilities. This happened due to a petition by Dr Satendra Singh founder of [[Infinite Ability]].<ref>{{cite news|title=MCI asks all medical institutions to be 'accessible'|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/mci-asks-all-medical-institutions-to-be-accessible/article4628862.ece|accessdate=21 April 2013|newspaper=The Hindu|date=18 April 2013}}</ref>\n\nStudents with a physical or mental impairment or learning disability may require note-taking assistance, which may be provided by a business offering such services, as with tutoring services. Talking books in the form of talking textbooks are available in Canadian secondary and post-secondary schools. Also, students may require adaptive technology to access computers and the Internet. These may be tax-exempt expenses in some jurisdictions with a medical prescription.\n\n===Test accessibility===\nTest accessibility is defined as the extent to which a test and its constituent item set eliminates barriers and permits the test-taker to demonstrate his or her knowledge of the tested content.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} Test accessibility involves an interaction between features of the test and individual test-taker characteristics.\n\nWith the passage of the [[No Child Left Behind Act]] of 2001 in the United States,<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.edweek.org/ew/section/multimedia/no-child-left-behind-overview-definition-summary.html|title=No Child Left Behind Overview: Definitions, Requirements, Criticisms, and More|work=Education Week|access-date=2018-07-02|language=en-US}}</ref> student accountability in essential content areas such as reading, mathematics, and science has become a major area of focus in educational reform.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www2.ed.gov/nclb/overview/intro/execsumm.html|title=Executive Summary of the No Child Left Behind Act of 2001|date=2007-11-20|website=www2.ed.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-07-02}}</ref> As a result, test developers have needed to create tests to ensure all students, including those with special needs (e.g., students identified with disabilities), are given the opportunity to demonstrate the extent to which they have mastered the content measured on state assessments. Currently, states are permitted to develop two different types of tests in addition to the standard grade-level assessments to target students with special needs. First, the alternate assessment may be used to report proficiency for up to 1% of students in a state. Second, new regulations permit the use of alternate assessments based on modified academic achievement standards to report proficiency for up to 2% of students in a state.\n\nTo ensure these new tests generate results that permit valid inferences about student performance, they must be accessible to as many individuals as possible. The Test Accessibility and Modification Inventory (TAMI)<ref>{{cite web |url=http://peabody.vanderbilt.edu/tami.xml |title=Peabody College of Education and Human Development &#124; Vanderbilt University |publisher=Peabody.vanderbilt.edu |date=2012-07-30 |accessdate=2012-08-13 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927114520/http://peabody.vanderbilt.edu/tami.xml |archive-date=2011-09-27 |url-status=dead }}</ref> and its companion evaluation tool, the Accessibility Rating Matrix (ARM), were designed to facilitate the evaluation of tests and test items with a focus on enhancing their accessibility. Both instruments integrate principles of accessibility theory and were guided by research on universal design, assessment accessibility, cognitive load theory, and research on item-writing and test development.

In 1983, he briefly joined [[the Party Boys]] for a tour of eastern Australia and their live album, ''[[Greatest Hits (of Other People)|Greatest Hits (Of Other People)]]'' (1983), before resuming his solo career. Australian rock music historian [[Ian McFarlane]] described Clapton as \"one of the most important Australian songwriters of the 1970s.\" On 12 October 1999, Clapton was inducted into the [[Australian Recording Industry Association]] (ARIA) [[ARIA Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]]. On 1 August 2014 Clapton published his memoirs, ''The Best Years of Our Lives''.\n\n== Career ==\n===Early Years===\n\nRichard Clapton's birth year and name are both elusive. In a 2002 interview with ''[[The Age]]''{{'}}s Warwick McFadyen, he described himself as being 50-something.<ref name=\"McFadyen\"/> An article in ''[[Who (magazine)|Who]]'' magazine (1996) gives his birth year as 1951,<ref name=\"Tulich\"/> while Ian McFarlane's ''[[Encyclopedia of Australian Rock and Pop]]'' (1999) has 1949.<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/> When the artist changed his birth name<!-- Actual birth name has not yet been found in a reliable source. See infobox note and talkpage for false candidates. --> in the mid-1960s, he used the last names of two of his music heroes, [[Keith Richards]] and [[Eric Clapton]].<ref name=\"Browne\"/>\n\nClapton's mother was a night nurse at a Sydney hospital and his Australian-Chinese father was a surgeon\u2014they had a volatile relationship and divorced when Clapton was two years old.<ref name=\"McFadyen\"/> During his childhood, Clapton had no contact with his father and lived with his mother, who had mental health problems.<ref name=\"Browne\"/> She would periodically place him in care until she committed suicide when he was aged ten.<ref name=\"Browne\"/> Clapton met his father at her funeral and was subsequently enrolled in a Sydney boarding school, [[Trinity Grammar School (New South Wales)|Trinity Grammar]], at [[Summer Hill, New South Wales|Summer Hill]].<ref name=\"Browne\"/> As an adolescent he listened to the [[Rolling Stones]] and [[Bob Dylan]], and was given his first electric guitar by a school friend's father.<ref name=\"Thompson\"/> He cites [[Richard Wherrett]]\u2014his house master and English teacher at Trinity who later became a theatre director\u2014as an early mentor.<ref name=\"Kruger\"/>\n\nIn 1965 Clapton formed Darktown Strutters with Ross Andreasen, Mick Bradley, Will Fowler, Dennis Hunter, Ross Lamonde and Ian Peepman.<ref name=\"Holmgren\"/> He left school in his final year without completing his mathematics examination.<ref name=\"Thompson\"/> He played guitar while training as a commercial artist in the 1960s.<ref name=\"Nimmervoll\"/> He raised enough money to board ship, in 1967, to London where he played with three locals in a pre-punk group. This was followed by a group with four North Americans who were raided by the police for [[marijuana]] importing.<ref name=\"McFadyen\"/> His visa had expired and he moved to Germany, where he played in a band, Bitch; he worked solo in folk clubs and on streets busking.<ref name=\"Nimmervoll\"/> Clapton, as guitarist and vocalist, was a member of Sopwith Camel (not the United States band of [[Sopwith Camel (band)|same name]]), with Burghard Rausch on drums and Michael G\u00fcnther on bass guitar (both members of [[krautrock]] group [[Agitation Free]]).<ref name=\"Thompson\"/><ref name=\"Agitation\"/> Clapton emerged in the early 1970s as a singer-songwriter in the \"troubadour\" style of [[Neil Young]] and [[Jackson Browne]].\n\n=== 1972\u201374: Debut album: ''Prussian Blue'' ===\n\nIn 1972, Clapton returned to Australia and signed a publishing deal with Essex Music and a recording deal with Infinity Records, a subsidiary of [[Festival Records (Australia)|Festival Records]]. His debut single, \"Last Train to Marseilles\", was released in October of that year. Clapton was backed by [[Red McKelvie]] on guitar (ex-[[The Flying Circus (band)|The Flying Circus]]), Kenny Kitching on pedal steel, [[John Capek]] on piano (ex-[[Carson (band)|Carson]]) with John Bois on bass guitar and Tony Bolton on drums, both from Country Radio (see [[Greg Quill]]). At the end of the year he briefly joined a [[jazz fusion|jazz-rock]] group, [[Sun 1972|Sun]], for six weeks into early 1973\u2014he replaced their previous lead singer, [[Ren\u00e9e Geyer]].<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/><ref name=\"Nimmervoll\"/>\n\nClapton's debut solo album, ''[[Prussian Blue (album)|Prussian Blue]]'', appeared in November 1973\u2014it included \"Last Train to Marseilles\" from a year earlier\u2014and was produced by [[Richard Batchens]] ([[Blackfeather]], [[Sherbet (band)|Sherbet]]). Two more singles were issued, \"All the Prodigal Children\" in October and \"I Wanna Be a Survivor\" in July 1974. On \"Hardly Know Myself\" and \"I Wanna Be a Survivor\" Clapton was backed by [[the La De Das]], with other tracks variously featuring McKelvie, Glenn Cardier on guitar, [[Russell Dunlop]] on drums, [[Mike Perjanik]] on organ, Trevor Wilson and Mike Lawler on bass guitar and Ian Bloxham on percussion.<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/>\n\nAccording to rock historian, Noel McGrath, the album suffered from lack of radio exposure\u2014Australian commercial pop radio was overtaken by a local version of the [[Drake-Chenault]] \"More Music\" format\u2014with a drastically restricted play list shutting out many Australian performers. Garry Raffaele of ''[[The Canberra Times]]'' observed, \"[he] sounds as though he's involved with the real issues of our time \u2014 pollution, man's inhumanity to those who share Spaceship Earth with him, communication difficulties. He writes of these things but his words are not likely to convince anybody. It's the simplistic trap again.\"<ref name=\"Raffaele\"/>\n\nDue to grass-roots support, ''Prussian Blue'', sold steadily and four years later it was still selling 200-500 copies per week.<ref name=\"McGrath\"/> Critics praised his album, which contained songs written while in Europe and Festival kept him on their books.<ref name=\"Nimmervoll\"/> He described the title track in [[Rolling Stone Australia|''Rolling Stone'' Australia]] as, \"the only song I ever contrived\" and \"came about when I was going through my 'wanna-write-me-a-masterpiece' stage, which everyone goes through.\" It took, \"six weeks getting all the right clever rhymes and all.\"<ref name=\"clapton/ref\" />\n\n=== 1975\u201377: ''Girls on the Avenue'' to ''Main Street Jive'' ===\n\nClapton's commercial breakthrough came with his single, \"[[Girls on the Avenue (song)|Girls on the Avenue]]\", issued in January 1975. Although Festival had little faith in the song\u2014initially releasing it as the B-side of \"Travelling Down the Castlereagh\"\u2014it was picked up by radio and reached No.&nbsp;4 on the Australian [[Kent Music Report]] Singles Chart in March.<ref name=\"Kent\"/> According to Clapton:<ref name=\"Jenkins\"/><blockquote>\"Not only did I not feel that 'Girls on the Avenue' was the perfect song, but Festival Records rejected that song six times. They'd say to me, 'What's the chorus, is it \"Don't you slip\" or \"Friday night ...\"?' I don't know! Why does a song have to have a hook or a chorus? You either like the song or you don't!\"</blockquote>\n\nThe song was written about his observations of women from and around the Avenue, [[Rose Bay, New South Wales|Rose Bay]], although it was seen as a [[paean]] to prostitutes by the record label, radio commentators and the prostitutes themselves.<ref name=\"Nimmervoll\"/> According to Clapton, it took half an hour to write.<ref name=\"clapton/ref\"/> He said the only real money he ever made out of \"Girls on the Avenue\" was when it became available \"on one of those bargain ''Explosive Hits'' ([[compilation album|compilations]]) and they sell about 400,000 each time.\"<ref name=\"clapton/ref\" /> According to him, in 1976, there were three cover versions of it: one by [[Mike McGear]], another by ex-[[Fairport Convention]] member, [[Trevor Lucas]], and an obscure Greek version.<ref name=\"clapton/ref\" />\n\nThe album, ''[[Girls on the Avenue]]'', also produced by Batchens appeared in April 1975. For touring and session work, he formed the Richard Clapton Band with John Carr on guitar, Ken Firth on bass guitar, Ace Follington on drums, McKelvie on guitar, and Tony Slavich on keyboards.<ref name=\"Holmgren\"/> The album cover depicted Clapton with three women\u2014one was a prostitute.<ref name=\"Nimmervoll\"/> Other tracks dealt with similar themes to his debut album. Because of the commercial nature of the song, he was accused of [[selling out]] by deliberately writing a commercial song, a claim he refuted.<ref name=\"clapton/ref\" /> A second single, \"Down the Road\", was released in June but did not chart.<ref name=\"Kent\"/>\n\nClapton moved to Melbourne to write new material for his third album, ''[[Main Street Jive]]'', which released in July 1976, again produced by Batchens.<ref name=\"Holmgren\"/><ref name=\"Nimmervoll\"/> He contributed six tracks to the film soundtrack for ''[[Highway One (film)|Highway One]]'' (1976).<ref name=\"Holmgren\"/> It provided the single, \"Capricorn Dancer\", which reached No.&nbsp;40 in early 1977 and remains a concert staple.<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/><ref name=\"Kent\"/> Other contributors to the soundtrack, produced and engineered by Batchens, were [[the Dingoes]], Bilgola Bop Band, [[Skyhooks (band)|Skyhooks]] and [[Ol' 55 (band)|Ol' 55]] with one track each.<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/><ref name=\"Holmgren\"/> Clapton toured Europe at the end of 1976 with his band including Slavich, Michael Hegerty on bass guitar (ex-[[Stars (Australian band)|Stars]]), Kirk Lorange on lead guitar and Jim Penson on drums (ex-Blackfeather).<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/><ref name=\"Holmgren\"/>\n\n=== 1977\u201379: ''Goodbye Tiger'' ===\n\nThe song, \"Goodbye Tiger\", was written after Clapton and his friend were in Sydney to see [[Hunter S. Thompson]].<ref name=\"ODonnell\"/> The singer-songwriter was referred to as \"Tiger\" by \"[his] 'beat poet' buddies.\"<ref name=\"ODonnell\"/> They got drunk and the [[binge drinking|binge]] continued as he got on a flight to Germany before crashing out at a friend's place in [[Frankfurt]].<ref name=\"ODonnell\"/> Clapton described how it was the only time he had ever written a song and not gone back to change something, \"It seemed like it had been the end of our innocence or something.\"<ref name=\"worst/ref\"/> He was later snowed in at a resort in [[Denmark]]. He said there was a [[blizzard]] and they were trapped, \"but we had enough beer so it didn't really matter\". It was there he wrote the bulk of what became his fourth studio album, ''[[Goodbye Tiger]]''.<ref name=\"worst/ref\" />\n\nIt was released in August 1977 and was acclaimed by McFarlane as \"his most celebrated work, an album full of rich, melodic and accessible rock with a distinctly Australian flavour. It established Clapton's reputation as one of the most important Australian songwriters of the 1970s.\"<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/> It reached No.&nbsp;11 on the albums chart in November 1977.<ref name=\"Kent\"/> It was the final album he recorded for Infinity Records and produced by Batchens. Many Clapton fans regard the melancholic record as his masterpiece: it included two of his popular tracks, the anthem, \"Deep Water\", which reached No.&nbsp;43 in November and \"Down in the Lucky Country\" released in January 1978.<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/><ref name=\"Kent\"/>\n\nHis backing band for ''Goodybe Tiger'' was: Hegerty, Lorange, Gunther Gorman on guitar, Diane McLennan on backing vocals, Cleis Pearce on viola (ex-[[MacKenzie Theory]]) and Greg Sheehan on drums (ex-Blackfeather, MacKenzie Theory). Additional musicians included Tony Ansell on keyboards, Tony Buchanan on saxophone and Penson.<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/><ref name=\"Holmgren\"/> Australian rock music historian, Chris Spencer, cites the album as one of his favourites, \"[It] represents one of the pinnacles of Australian rock music. Clapton, essentially a singer-songwriter, working within the security of numerous band line-ups, wrote his best lyrics on this album. He never reached the same heights again, particularly with his melodies, visions and observations of urban Australia.\"<ref name=\"Spencer\"/>\n\nClapton said working on the album was the worst year of his life, \"but I guess that's the record I will always be remembered for.\"<ref name=\"worst/ref\" /> During 1978 he toured nationally with Ansell, Hegerty, Lorange, McLennan and Sheehan.<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/> Late in that year he travelled to Los Angeles to record his fifth studio album, ''[[Hearts on the Nightline]]''. Released in April 1979, it was produced by Dallas Smith for the Interfusion label on Festival.<ref name=\"Holmgren\"/> The album peaked at No.&nbsp;17 but failed to attract international attention, it was supported by a 75-date national tour.\n\n=== 1980s: ''Dark Spaces'' to ''Glory Road'' ===\n\nClapton returned to Sydney in 1980 to record and produce his sixth studio album, ''[[Dark Spaces]]'' (August 1980).<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/><ref name=\"Holmgren\"/> His session musicians included Ansell, [[Andrew Durant (musician)|Andrew Durant]] on rhythm guitar (Stars), Clive Harrison on bass guitar (ex-Kush, Avalanche), Mark Moffatt on lead guitar and Kerry Jacobsen on drums ([[Dragon (band)|Dragon]]). It peaked in the top&nbsp;30 and was dedicated to Durant who had died of cancer in May, before its release. Members of Stars, and various artists including Clapton, performed at the Andrew Durant Memorial Concert in August, which was released as a live double-album in February 1981.<ref name=\"Holmgren\"/><ref name=\"McFStars\"/> During the decade he consolidated his career, working with other artists and as a record producer. In May of that year he produced the third single, \"[[The Loved One (song)|The Loved One]]\", for [[New wave music|new wave]] band, [[INXS]], which was recorded at Studios 301 in Sydney.<ref name=\"Burn\"/><ref name=\"BandRoadChronology1\"/> It was a cover of a 1966 song by [[the Loved Ones]] and peaked in the Top&nbsp;20.<ref name=\"Kent\"/> In July\u2013August, he produced their second album ''[[Underneath the Colours]]'', which reached the Top&nbsp;20 after its October release.<ref name=\"Holmgren\"/><ref name=h3g3/>\n\nIn 1982 Clapton signed with WEA and the [[Mark Opitz]]-produced, ''[[The Great Escape (Richard Clapton album)|The Great Escape]]'' (March 1982), had contributions from members of [[Cold Chisel]] and INXS.<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/><ref name=\"Holmgren\"/> The album, which peaked at No.&nbsp;8 in March, provided three singles. The hard-rocking \"[[I Am an Island (song)|I Am an Island]]\", with Cold Chisel's [[Ian Moss]] on guitar and [[Jimmy Barnes]] on backing vocals, reached the top&nbsp;20. Two other singles, \"Spellbound\" (April) and \"The Best Years of Our Lives\" (September) did not chart in the top&nbsp;50. In May, WEA released a compilation album, ''The Very Best of Richard Clapton'', which reached No.&nbsp;18 with ''The Great Escape'' still in the top&nbsp;20.<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/><ref name=\"Kent\"/>\n\nIn 1983 Clapton joined [[the Party Boys]], replacing [[James Reyne]] ([[Australian Crawl]]) on lead vocals, the live album ''[[Greatest Hits (of Other People)|Greatest Hits (Of Other People)]]'' and a single, \"[[I Fought the Law]]\"\u2014a cover of the [[Sonny Curtis]] song\u2014resulted from an extensive tour of the east coast of Australia. Clapton left that band to re-focus on his solo career and was replaced on vocals by [[Graeme Strachan|Shirley Strachan]] (ex-Skyhooks).<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/>\n\nIn September 1984 he released his eighth studio album, ''[[Solidarity (Richard Clapton album)|Solidarity]]'', on [[Mushroom Records]] which was produced by Opitz, [[Ricky Fataar]], Tim Kramer and Moffatt.<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/><ref name=\"Holmgren\"/> For the album he used [[Graham Bidstrup]] on drums (ex-[[The Angels (Australian band)|The Angels]], the Party Boys), James Black on keyboards (ex-[[Mondo Rock]]), [[Kevin Borich]] on guitar (ex-La De Das, the Party Boys), Fataar on drums, Allan Mansfield on keyboards (Dragon), Graham Thompson on bass guitar (ex-Stars), and backing vocals from Mary Bradfield, [[Venetta Fields]] and [[Mark Williams (singer)|Mark Williams]]. Clapton and Borich released a duet single, \"Spirit of Sydney\", in 1986.<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/>\n\nClapton rejoined WEA in 1987 for his ninth album, ''[[Glory Road (Richard Clapton album)|Glory Road]]'', released in October, and its three singles, which were produced by [[Jon Farriss]] of INXS as a return favour for the production of ''Underneath the Colours''. A live album, ''[[The Best Years of Our Lives (Richard Clapton album)|The Best Years of Our Lives]]'' was recorded on 16 April 1989 and released in September. His band were Hegerty, Lorange, Moffatt on guitar, Jeff Bartolomei on keyboards, Ben Butler on guitar, and Steve Sowerby on drums.<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/> The album peaked in the top&nbsp;30 on the [[Australian Recording Industry Association]] (ARIA) [[ARIA Charts|Albums Chart]].<ref name=\"AusCharts\"/>\n\n=== 1990s-2010: Continued success and ARIA Hall of Fame ===\n\nClapton was without a recording contract from 1989 to 1992 and had four changes of management until he signed with [[Sony Music Entertainment|Sony Music]]/[[Columbia Records]] for the release of ''Distant Thunder'' in May 1993.<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/> It provided four singles and was produced by Clapton.<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/><ref name=\"Holmgren\"/> It charted in the top&nbsp;40 but no single reached the top&nbsp;50 on ARIA's Singles Chart. His second album for Sony, ''Angeltown'' appeared in May 1996 with a single, \"Dixieland\", in March\u2014neither reached their respective top&nbsp;50 charts.<ref name=\"AusCharts\"/> In October 1999 Clapton released a compilation ''[[Richard Clapton \u2013 The Definitive Anthology]]'', which peaked in the top&nbsp;30.<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/><ref name=\"AusCharts\"/> The album was released to coincide with his [[ARIA Hall of Fame]] induction at the [[ARIA Music Awards of 1999]] alongside [[Jimmy Little]].<ref name=\"ARIA1999\"/>\n\nClapton spent four years writing and recording his twelfth studio album, ''Diamond Mine'', at his home studio, a process he described as the most creatively liberating experience of his recording career. It was released in May 2004\u2014eight years after his previous studio album\u2014but did not chart.<ref name=\"AusCharts\"/> On his 2006 album, ''Rewired'', also recorded in the home studio, Clapton provided \"unplugged\" or [[acoustic music|acoustic]] versions of his early songs.\n\nClapton had appeared on ''[[Countdown (Australian TV series)|Countdown]]''\u2014an Australian pop music show on national broadcaster, [[ABC Television|ABC-TV]]\u2014during the late 1970s and early 1980s. He toured with other artists in the [[Countdown Spectacular]] two series of concerts in Australia between late-August and early-September 2007. He sang three of his songs, including the crowd favourite, \"Girls on the Avenue\".\n\nIn 2008 on [[Australia Day]] (26 January) Clapton performed at [[Parliament House, Canberra]]. To celebrate 35 years of recording, Clapton held a one-off concert at the Sydney [[State Theatre (Sydney)|State Theatre]] on 28 June. The event included a line-up of Australian musicians who had played with him including Jon Farriss from INXS. The performance was recorded for a live album, ''Live at the State Theatre'', which was released in October.\n\nClapton showcases his 1977 album, ''Goodbye Tiger'', at that same venue in September 2009. The first concert sold out in less than an hour and a second was added. The entire album was performed as well as an eclectic mix of old and new tracks played in the second set. On the second night Clapton and band were joined by Moss (Cold Chisel) who played a rendition of \"I Am an Island\". Clapton inducted one of his favourite bands, [[the Dingoes]] into the ARIA Hall of Fame on 29 August [[ARIA Music Awards of 2009|2009]]. Clapton's portrait by Alexander McKenzie was a [[Archibald Prize 2009 finalists|finalist in the 2009]] [[Archibald Prize]].<ref name=\"Archibald\"/> In October 2010, ''Goodbye Tiger'' was listed at No.&nbsp;15 in the book, ''[[100 Best Australian Albums]]''.<ref name=\"ODonnell\"/>\n\n===2010-present: Later years===\nIn August 2012 Clapton's first studio album in eight years, ''Harlequin Nights'', was issued on his own label and distributed by [[MGM Distribution|MGM]].<ref name=\"Harlequin 1\"/> He was assisted on the album by Danny Spencer on guitar, who also co-wrote some tracks.<ref name=\"Harlequin 1\"/> ''[[The Australian]]''{{'}}s reviewer noted that Clapton \"hasn't lost his touch as a songwriter\" as the album \"veers between the heady optimism of opening track 'Sunny Side Up' and the poignant autumnal reflection of the beautiful 'Blue Skies'\" while Clapton is a \"troubadour buffeted by uncertain winds and still searching for answers in songs such as the epic 'Vapour Trails' but pushing on regardless in the folksy 'Run Like a River'\".<ref name=\"Harlequin 1\"/> \n\nIn August 2014, a retrospective album titled ''[[Best Years 1974\u20132014|Best Years 1974\u20132014: The 40th Anniversary Collection]]'' was released and peaked at number 36 on the ARIA Charts.\n\nHe issued his fifteenth studio album, ''House of Orange'', in April 2016, which was recorded in Nashville with Moffatt co-producing.<ref name=\"Hunter\"/><ref name=\"Cashmere 0416\"/> Brooke Hunter of ''girl.com.au'' noticed, \"Working with [Moffatt] in the U.S. has put a country \u2013 soul twang into [Clapton]'s band that spills out into classics like 'Deep Water\", 'The Best Years of Our Lives\", 'Goodbye Tiger' and so many other songs that have made [him] a national treasure.\"<ref name=\"Hunter\"/>\n\n== Personal life ==\n\nClapton's mother was a nurse who died when he was ten; his father was a doctor who died in c. 2004.<ref name=\"Browne\"/> Clapton has [[Pterygium (conjunctiva)|pterygiums]] and his eye surgeon recommended he wear dark glasses.<ref name=\"Thompson\"/> Clapton met Susie, a fashion model, in the mid-1980s.<ref name=\"Thompson\"/> They married and had a set of twins.<ref name=\"Tulich\"/><ref name=\"Browne\"/> In March 2008 he appeared on ABC-TV's ''[[Talking Heads (Australian TV series)|Talking Heads]]'' where he told [[Peter Thompson (broadcaster)|Peter Thompson]] about his early life.<ref name=\"Thompson\"/> He described the impact of his mother's erratic lifestyle prior to her suicide when he was ten; he then met his father for the first time and was enrolled in a private boarding school: \"My mother was sort of the antithesis of my father, because she had always aspired to... more the Bohemian artistic side of life\" and \"it was a bit of a shock when my father came to collect me... we just never got on. It was a fiery clash from the very start. My father obviously wanted me to become a doctor or some similar sort of career\".<ref name=\"Thompson\"/>\n\nClapton started writing his autobiography in mid-2010, which he hoped would appear later that year.<ref name=\"Moran\"/> He told Moran of ''The Sunday Telegraph'', \"I have no regrets about anything in my life. It has been a very colourful ride. I don't want to homogenise and pasteurise this book because I don't have any regrets about anything I've done in my life\".<ref name=\"Moran\"/> Clapton and Susie were divorced by July 2012.<ref name=\"Cashmere 0712\"/> He told [[Paul Cashmere]] of ''Noise11.com'', \"I went through a really miserable divorce ... I wrote a couple of songs like 'Over the Borderline' which was a last ditch attempt to make amends with my ex-wife. The divorce got very long and drawn out. It went on for about five years which is just absurd\".<ref name=\"Cashmere 0712\"/>\n\nOn 1 August 2014 Clapton published his memoirs, ''The Best Years of Our Lives'', via [[Allen & Unwin]].<ref name=\"NLA Best Years\"/> ''[[The Observer (Gladstone)|The Observer]]''{{'}}s Tammy Lewis felt, \"[it] begins from the late 60s and continues to 1990, as he was forced to keep the word limit down... it continues to touch on intrigue, excitement and some rather PG related stories.\"<ref name=\"Lewis\"/> James Rose of ''Daily Review'', observed, \"He writes vernacular very well.

In 1983, he briefly joined [[the Party Boys]] for a tour of eastern Australia and their live album, ''[[Greatest Hits (of Other People)|Greatest Hits (Of Other People)]]'' (1983), before resuming his solo career. Australian rock music historian [[Ian McFarlane]] described Clapton as \"one of the most important Australian songwriters of the 1970s.\" On 12 October 1999, Clapton was inducted into the [[Australian Recording Industry Association]] (ARIA) [[ARIA Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]]. On 1 August 2014 Clapton published his memoirs, ''The Best Years of Our Lives''.\n\n== Career ==\n===Early Years===\n\nRichard Clapton's birth year and name are both elusive. In a 2002 interview with ''[[The Age]]''{{'}}s Warwick McFadyen, he described himself as being 50-something.<ref name=\"McFadyen\"/> An article in ''[[Who (magazine)|Who]]'' magazine (1996) gives his birth year as 1951,<ref name=\"Tulich\"/> while Ian McFarlane's ''[[Encyclopedia of Australian Rock and Pop]]'' (1999) has 1949.<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/> When the artist changed his birth name<!-- Actual birth name has not yet been found in a reliable source. See infobox note and talkpage for false candidates. --> in the mid-1960s, he used the last names of two of his music heroes, [[Keith Richards]] and [[Eric Clapton]].<ref name=\"Browne\"/>\n\nClapton's mother was a night nurse at a Sydney hospital and his Australian-Chinese father was a surgeon\u2014they had a volatile relationship and divorced when Clapton was two years old.<ref name=\"McFadyen\"/> During his childhood, Clapton had no contact with his father and lived with his mother, who had mental health problems.<ref name=\"Browne\"/> She would periodically place him in care until she committed suicide when he was aged ten.<ref name=\"Browne\"/> Clapton met his father at her funeral and was subsequently enrolled in a Sydney boarding school, [[Trinity Grammar School (New South Wales)|Trinity Grammar]], at [[Summer Hill, New South Wales|Summer Hill]].<ref name=\"Browne\"/> As an adolescent he listened to the [[Rolling Stones]] and [[Bob Dylan]], and was given his first electric guitar by a school friend's father.<ref name=\"Thompson\"/> He cites [[Richard Wherrett]]\u2014his house master and English teacher at Trinity who later became a theatre director\u2014as an early mentor.<ref name=\"Kruger\"/>\n\nIn 1965 Clapton formed Darktown Strutters with Ross Andreasen, Mick Bradley, Will Fowler, Dennis Hunter, Ross Lamonde and Ian Peepman.<ref name=\"Holmgren\"/> He left school in his final year without completing his mathematics examination.<ref name=\"Thompson\"/> He played guitar while training as a commercial artist in the 1960s.<ref name=\"Nimmervoll\"/> He raised enough money to board ship, in 1967, to London where he played with three locals in a pre-punk group. This was followed by a group with four North Americans who were raided by the police for [[marijuana]] importing.<ref name=\"McFadyen\"/> His visa had expired and he moved to Germany, where he played in a band, Bitch; he worked solo in folk clubs and on streets busking.<ref name=\"Nimmervoll\"/> Clapton, as guitarist and vocalist, was a member of Sopwith Camel (not the United States band of [[Sopwith Camel (band)|same name]]), with Burghard Rausch on drums and Michael G\u00fcnther on bass guitar (both members of [[krautrock]] group [[Agitation Free]]).<ref name=\"Thompson\"/><ref name=\"Agitation\"/> Clapton emerged in the early 1970s as a singer-songwriter in the \"troubadour\" style of [[Neil Young]] and [[Jackson Browne]].\n\n=== 1972\u201374: Debut album: ''Prussian Blue'' ===\n\nIn 1972, Clapton returned to Australia and signed a publishing deal with Essex Music and a recording deal with Infinity Records, a subsidiary of [[Festival Records (Australia)|Festival Records]]. His debut single, \"Last Train to Marseilles\", was released in October of that year. Clapton was backed by [[Red McKelvie]] on guitar (ex-[[The Flying Circus (band)|The Flying Circus]]), Kenny Kitching on pedal steel, [[John Capek]] on piano (ex-[[Carson (band)|Carson]]) with John Bois on bass guitar and Tony Bolton on drums, both from Country Radio (see [[Greg Quill]]). At the end of the year he briefly joined a [[jazz fusion|jazz-rock]] group, [[Sun 1972|Sun]], for six weeks into early 1973\u2014he replaced their previous lead singer, [[Ren\u00e9e Geyer]].<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/><ref name=\"Nimmervoll\"/>\n\nClapton's debut solo album, ''[[Prussian Blue (album)|Prussian Blue]]'', appeared in November 1973\u2014it included \"Last Train to Marseilles\" from a year earlier\u2014and was produced by [[Richard Batchens]] ([[Blackfeather]], [[Sherbet (band)|Sherbet]]). Two more singles were issued, \"All the Prodigal Children\" in October and \"I Wanna Be a Survivor\" in July 1974. On \"Hardly Know Myself\" and \"I Wanna Be a Survivor\" Clapton was backed by [[the La De Das]], with other tracks variously featuring McKelvie, Glenn Cardier on guitar, [[Russell Dunlop]] on drums, [[Mike Perjanik]] on organ, Trevor Wilson and Mike Lawler on bass guitar and Ian Bloxham on percussion.<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/>\n\nAccording to rock historian, Noel McGrath, the album suffered from lack of radio exposure\u2014Australian commercial pop radio was overtaken by a local version of the [[Drake-Chenault]] \"More Music\" format\u2014with a drastically restricted play list shutting out many Australian performers. Garry Raffaele of ''[[The Canberra Times]]'' observed, \"[he] sounds as though he's involved with the real issues of our time \u2014 pollution, man's inhumanity to those who share Spaceship Earth with him, communication difficulties. He writes of these things but his words are not likely to convince anybody. It's the simplistic trap again.\"<ref name=\"Raffaele\"/>\n\nDue to grass-roots support, ''Prussian Blue'', sold steadily and four years later it was still selling 200-500 copies per week.<ref name=\"McGrath\"/> Critics praised his album, which contained songs written while in Europe and Festival kept him on their books.<ref name=\"Nimmervoll\"/> He described the title track in [[Rolling Stone Australia|''Rolling Stone'' Australia]] as, \"the only song I ever contrived\" and \"came about when I was going through my 'wanna-write-me-a-masterpiece' stage, which everyone goes through.\" It took, \"six weeks getting all the right clever rhymes and all.\"<ref name=\"clapton/ref\" />\n\n=== 1975\u201377: ''Girls on the Avenue'' to ''Main Street Jive'' ===\n\nClapton's commercial breakthrough came with his single, \"[[Girls on the Avenue (song)|Girls on the Avenue]]\", issued in January 1975. Although Festival had little faith in the song\u2014initially releasing it as the B-side of \"Travelling Down the Castlereagh\"\u2014it was picked up by radio and reached No.&nbsp;4 on the Australian [[Kent Music Report]] Singles Chart in March.<ref name=\"Kent\"/> According to Clapton:<ref name=\"Jenkins\"/><blockquote>\"Not only did I not feel that 'Girls on the Avenue' was the perfect song, but Festival Records rejected that song six times. They'd say to me, 'What's the chorus, is it \"Don't you slip\" or \"Friday night ...\"?' I don't know! Why does a song have to have a hook or a chorus? You either like the song or you don't!\"</blockquote>\n\nThe song was written about his observations of women from and around the Avenue, [[Rose Bay, New South Wales|Rose Bay]], although it was seen as a [[paean]] to prostitutes by the record label, radio commentators and the prostitutes themselves.<ref name=\"Nimmervoll\"/> According to Clapton, it took half an hour to write.<ref name=\"clapton/ref\"/> He said the only real money he ever made out of \"Girls on the Avenue\" was when it became available \"on one of those bargain ''Explosive Hits'' ([[compilation album|compilations]]) and they sell about 400,000 each time.\"<ref name=\"clapton/ref\" /> According to him, in 1976, there were three cover versions of it: one by [[Mike McGear]], another by ex-[[Fairport Convention]] member, [[Trevor Lucas]], and an obscure Greek version.<ref name=\"clapton/ref\" />\n\nThe album, ''[[Girls on the Avenue]]'', also produced by Batchens appeared in April 1975. For touring and session work, he formed the Richard Clapton Band with John Carr on guitar, Ken Firth on bass guitar, Ace Follington on drums, McKelvie on guitar, and Tony Slavich on keyboards.<ref name=\"Holmgren\"/> The album cover depicted Clapton with three women\u2014one was a prostitute.<ref name=\"Nimmervoll\"/> Other tracks dealt with similar themes to his debut album. Because of the commercial nature of the song, he was accused of [[selling out]] by deliberately writing a commercial song, a claim he refuted.<ref name=\"clapton/ref\" /> A second single, \"Down the Road\", was released in June but did not chart.<ref name=\"Kent\"/>\n\nClapton moved to Melbourne to write new material for his third album, ''[[Main Street Jive]]'', which released in July 1976, again produced by Batchens.<ref name=\"Holmgren\"/><ref name=\"Nimmervoll\"/> He contributed six tracks to the film soundtrack for ''[[Highway One (film)|Highway One]]'' (1976).<ref name=\"Holmgren\"/> It provided the single, \"Capricorn Dancer\", which reached No.&nbsp;40 in early 1977 and remains a concert staple.<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/><ref name=\"Kent\"/> Other contributors to the soundtrack, produced and engineered by Batchens, were [[the Dingoes]], Bilgola Bop Band, [[Skyhooks (band)|Skyhooks]] and [[Ol' 55 (band)|Ol' 55]] with one track each.<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/><ref name=\"Holmgren\"/> Clapton toured Europe at the end of 1976 with his band including Slavich, Michael Hegerty on bass guitar (ex-[[Stars (Australian band)|Stars]]), Kirk Lorange on lead guitar and Jim Penson on drums (ex-Blackfeather).<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/><ref name=\"Holmgren\"/>\n\n=== 1977\u201379: ''Goodbye Tiger'' ===\n\nThe song, \"Goodbye Tiger\", was written after Clapton and his friend were in Sydney to see [[Hunter S. Thompson]].<ref name=\"ODonnell\"/> The singer-songwriter was referred to as \"Tiger\" by \"[his] 'beat poet' buddies.\"<ref name=\"ODonnell\"/> They got drunk and the [[binge drinking|binge]] continued as he got on a flight to Germany before crashing out at a friend's place in [[Frankfurt]].<ref name=\"ODonnell\"/> Clapton described how it was the only time he had ever written a song and not gone back to change something, \"It seemed like it had been the end of our innocence or something.\"<ref name=\"worst/ref\"/> He was later snowed in at a resort in [[Denmark]]. He said there was a [[blizzard]] and they were trapped, \"but we had enough beer so it didn't really matter\". It was there he wrote the bulk of what became his fourth studio album, ''[[Goodbye Tiger]]''.<ref name=\"worst/ref\" />\n\nIt was released in August 1977 and was acclaimed by McFarlane as \"his most celebrated work, an album full of rich, melodic and accessible rock with a distinctly Australian flavour. It established Clapton's reputation as one of the most important Australian songwriters of the 1970s.\"<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/> It reached No.&nbsp;11 on the albums chart in November 1977.<ref name=\"Kent\"/> It was the final album he recorded for Infinity Records and produced by Batchens. Many Clapton fans regard the melancholic record as his masterpiece: it included two of his popular tracks, the anthem, \"Deep Water\", which reached No.&nbsp;43 in November and \"Down in the Lucky Country\" released in January 1978.<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/><ref name=\"Kent\"/>\n\nHis backing band for ''Goodybe Tiger'' was: Hegerty, Lorange, Gunther Gorman on guitar, Diane McLennan on backing vocals, Cleis Pearce on viola (ex-[[MacKenzie Theory]]) and Greg Sheehan on drums (ex-Blackfeather, MacKenzie Theory). Additional musicians included Tony Ansell on keyboards, Tony Buchanan on saxophone and Penson.<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/><ref name=\"Holmgren\"/> Australian rock music historian, Chris Spencer, cites the album as one of his favourites, \"[It] represents one of the pinnacles of Australian rock music. Clapton, essentially a singer-songwriter, working within the security of numerous band line-ups, wrote his best lyrics on this album. He never reached the same heights again, particularly with his melodies, visions and observations of urban Australia.\"<ref name=\"Spencer\"/>\n\nClapton said working on the album was the worst year of his life, \"but I guess that's the record I will always be remembered for.\"<ref name=\"worst/ref\" /> During 1978 he toured nationally with Ansell, Hegerty, Lorange, McLennan and Sheehan.<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/> Late in that year he travelled to Los Angeles to record his fifth studio album, ''[[Hearts on the Nightline]]''. Released in April 1979, it was produced by Dallas Smith for the Interfusion label on Festival.<ref name=\"Holmgren\"/> The album peaked at No.&nbsp;17 but failed to attract international attention, it was supported by a 75-date national tour.\n\n=== 1980s: ''Dark Spaces'' to ''Glory Road'' ===\n\nClapton returned to Sydney in 1980 to record and produce his sixth studio album, ''[[Dark Spaces]]'' (August 1980).<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/><ref name=\"Holmgren\"/> His session musicians included Ansell, [[Andrew Durant (musician)|Andrew Durant]] on rhythm guitar (Stars), Clive Harrison on bass guitar (ex-Kush, Avalanche), Mark Moffatt on lead guitar and Kerry Jacobsen on drums ([[Dragon (band)|Dragon]]). It peaked in the top&nbsp;30 and was dedicated to Durant who had died of cancer in May, before its release. Members of Stars, and various artists including Clapton, performed at the Andrew Durant Memorial Concert in August, which was released as a live double-album in February 1981.<ref name=\"Holmgren\"/><ref name=\"McFStars\"/> During the decade he consolidated his career, working with other artists and as a record producer. In May of that year he produced the third single, \"[[The Loved One (song)|The Loved One]]\", for [[New wave music|new wave]] band, [[INXS]], which was recorded at Studios 301 in Sydney.<ref name=\"Burn\"/><ref name=\"BandRoadChronology1\"/> It was a cover of a 1966 song by [[the Loved Ones]] and peaked in the Top&nbsp;20.<ref name=\"Kent\"/> In July\u2013August, he produced their second album ''[[Underneath the Colours]]'', which reached the Top&nbsp;20 after its October release.<ref name=\"Holmgren\"/><ref name=h3g3/>\n\nIn 1982 Clapton signed with WEA and the [[Mark Opitz]]-produced, ''[[The Great Escape (Richard Clapton album)|The Great Escape]]'' (March 1982), had contributions from members of [[Cold Chisel]] and INXS.<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/><ref name=\"Holmgren\"/> The album, which peaked at No.&nbsp;8 in March, provided three singles. The hard-rocking \"[[I Am an Island (song)|I Am an Island]]\", with Cold Chisel's [[Ian Moss]] on guitar and [[Jimmy Barnes]] on backing vocals, reached the top&nbsp;20. Two other singles, \"Spellbound\" (April) and \"The Best Years of Our Lives\" (September) did not chart in the top&nbsp;50. In May, WEA released a compilation album, ''The Very Best of Richard Clapton'', which reached No.&nbsp;18 with ''The Great Escape'' still in the top&nbsp;20.<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/><ref name=\"Kent\"/>\n\nIn 1983 Clapton joined [[the Party Boys]], replacing [[James Reyne]] ([[Australian Crawl]]) on lead vocals, the live album ''[[Greatest Hits (of Other People)|Greatest Hits (Of Other People)]]'' and a single, \"[[I Fought the Law]]\"\u2014a cover of the [[Sonny Curtis]] song\u2014resulted from an extensive tour of the east coast of Australia. Clapton left that band to re-focus on his solo career and was replaced on vocals by [[Graeme Strachan|Shirley Strachan]] (ex-Skyhooks).<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/>\n\nIn September 1984 he released his eighth studio album, ''[[Solidarity (Richard Clapton album)|Solidarity]]'', on [[Mushroom Records]] which was produced by Opitz, [[Ricky Fataar]], Tim Kramer and Moffatt.<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/><ref name=\"Holmgren\"/> For the album he used [[Graham Bidstrup]] on drums (ex-[[The Angels (Australian band)|The Angels]], the Party Boys), James Black on keyboards (ex-[[Mondo Rock]]), [[Kevin Borich]] on guitar (ex-La De Das, the Party Boys), Fataar on drums, Allan Mansfield on keyboards (Dragon), Graham Thompson on bass guitar (ex-Stars), and backing vocals from Mary Bradfield, [[Venetta Fields]] and [[Mark Williams (singer)|Mark Williams]]. Clapton and Borich released a duet single, \"Spirit of Sydney\", in 1986.<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/>\n\nClapton rejoined WEA in 1987 for his ninth album, ''[[Glory Road (Richard Clapton album)|Glory Road]]'', released in October, and its three singles, which were produced by [[Jon Farriss]] of INXS as a return favour for the production of ''Underneath the Colours''. A live album, ''[[The Best Years of Our Lives (Richard Clapton album)|The Best Years of Our Lives]]'' was recorded on 16 April 1989 and released in September. His band were Hegerty, Lorange, Moffatt on guitar, Jeff Bartolomei on keyboards, Ben Butler on guitar, and Steve Sowerby on drums.<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/> The album peaked in the top&nbsp;30 on the [[Australian Recording Industry Association]] (ARIA) [[ARIA Charts|Albums Chart]].<ref name=\"AusCharts\"/>\n\n=== 1990s-2010: Continued success and ARIA Hall of Fame ===\n\nClapton was without a recording contract from 1989 to 1992 and had four changes of management until he signed with [[Sony Music Entertainment|Sony Music]]/[[Columbia Records]] for the release of ''Distant Thunder'' in May 1993.<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/> It provided four singles and was produced by Clapton.<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/><ref name=\"Holmgren\"/> It charted in the top&nbsp;40 but no single reached the top&nbsp;50 on ARIA's Singles Chart. His second album for Sony, ''Angeltown'' appeared in May 1996 with a single, \"Dixieland\", in March\u2014neither reached their respective top&nbsp;50 charts.<ref name=\"AusCharts\"/> In October 1999 Clapton released a compilation ''[[Richard Clapton \u2013 The Definitive Anthology]]'', which peaked in the top&nbsp;30.<ref name=\"McFarlane\"/><ref name=\"AusCharts\"/> The album was released to coincide with his [[ARIA Hall of Fame]] induction at the [[ARIA Music Awards of 1999]] alongside [[Jimmy Little]].<ref name=\"ARIA1999\"/>\n\nClapton spent four years writing and recording his twelfth studio album, ''Diamond Mine'', at his home studio, a process he described as the most creatively liberating experience of his recording career. It was released in May 2004\u2014eight years after his previous studio album\u2014but did not chart.<ref name=\"AusCharts\"/> On his 2006 album, ''Rewired'', also recorded in the home studio, Clapton provided \"unplugged\" or [[acoustic music|acoustic]] versions of his early songs.\n\nClapton had appeared on ''[[Countdown (Australian TV series)|Countdown]]''\u2014an Australian pop music show on national broadcaster, [[ABC Television|ABC-TV]]\u2014during the late 1970s and early 1980s. He toured with other artists in the [[Countdown Spectacular]] two series of concerts in Australia between late-August and early-September 2007. He sang three of his songs, including the crowd favourite, \"Girls on the Avenue\".\n\nIn 2008 on [[Australia Day]] (26 January) Clapton performed at [[Parliament House, Canberra]]. To celebrate 35 years of recording, Clapton held a one-off concert at the Sydney [[State Theatre (Sydney)|State Theatre]] on 28 June. The event included a line-up of Australian musicians who had played with him including Jon Farriss from INXS. The performance was recorded for a live album, ''Live at the State Theatre'', which was released in October.\n\nClapton showcases his 1977 album, ''Goodbye Tiger'', at that same venue in September 2009. The first concert sold out in less than an hour and a second was added. The entire album was performed as well as an eclectic mix of old and new tracks played in the second set. On the second night Clapton and band were joined by Moss (Cold Chisel) who played a rendition of \"I Am an Island\". Clapton inducted one of his favourite bands, [[the Dingoes]] into the ARIA Hall of Fame on 29 August [[ARIA Music Awards of 2009|2009]]. Clapton's portrait by Alexander McKenzie was a [[Archibald Prize 2009 finalists|finalist in the 2009]] [[Archibald Prize]].<ref name=\"Archibald\"/> In October 2010, ''Goodbye Tiger'' was listed at No.&nbsp;15 in the book, ''[[100 Best Australian Albums]]''.<ref name=\"ODonnell\"/>\n\n===2010-present: Later years===\nIn August 2012 Clapton's first studio album in eight years, ''Harlequin Nights'', was issued on his own label and distributed by [[MGM Distribution|MGM]].<ref name=\"Harlequin 1\"/> He was assisted on the album by Danny Spencer on guitar, who also co-wrote some tracks.<ref name=\"Harlequin 1\"/> ''[[The Australian]]''{{'}}s reviewer noted that Clapton \"hasn't lost his touch as a songwriter\" as the album \"veers between the heady optimism of opening track 'Sunny Side Up' and the poignant autumnal reflection of the beautiful 'Blue Skies'\" while Clapton is a \"troubadour buffeted by uncertain winds and still searching for answers in songs such as the epic 'Vapour Trails' but pushing on regardless in the folksy 'Run Like a River'\".<ref name=\"Harlequin 1\"/> \n\nIn August 2014, a retrospective album titled ''[[Best Years 1974\u20132014|Best Years 1974\u20132014: The 40th Anniversary Collection]]'' was released and peaked at number 36 on the ARIA Charts.\n\nHe issued his fifteen studio album, ''House of Orange'', in April 2016, which was recorded in Nashville with Moffatt co-producing.<ref name=\"Hunter\"/><ref name=\"Cashmere 0416\"/> Brooke Hunter of ''girl.com.au'' noticed, \"Working with [Moffatt] in the U.S. has put a country \u2013 soul twang into [Clapton]'s band that spills out into classics like 'Deep Water\", 'The Best Years of Our Lives\", 'Goodbye Tiger' and so many other songs that have made [him] a national treasure.\"<ref name=\"Hunter\"/>\n\n== Personal life ==\n\nClapton's mother was a nurse who died when he was ten; his father was a doctor who died in c. 2004.<ref name=\"Browne\"/> Clapton has [[Pterygium (conjunctiva)|pterygiums]] and his eye surgeon recommended he wear dark glasses.<ref name=\"Thompson\"/> Clapton met Susie, a fashion model, in the mid-1980s.<ref name=\"Thompson\"/> They married and had a set of twins.<ref name=\"Tulich\"/><ref name=\"Browne\"/> In March 2008 he appeared on ABC-TV's ''[[Talking Heads (Australian TV series)|Talking Heads]]'' where he told [[Peter Thompson (broadcaster)|Peter Thompson]] about his early life.<ref name=\"Thompson\"/> He described the impact of his mother's erratic lifestyle prior to her suicide when he was ten; he then met his father for the first time and was enrolled in a private boarding school: \"My mother was sort of the antithesis of my father, because she had always aspired to... more the Bohemian artistic side of life\" and \"it was a bit of a shock when my father came to collect me... we just never got on. It was a fiery clash from the very start. My father obviously wanted me to become a doctor or some similar sort of career\".<ref name=\"Thompson\"/>\n\nClapton started writing his autobiography in mid-2010, which he hoped would appear later that year.<ref name=\"Moran\"/> He told Moran of ''The Sunday Telegraph'', \"I have no regrets about anything in my life. It has been a very colourful ride. I don't want to homogenise and pasteurise this book because I don't have any regrets about anything I've done in my life\".<ref name=\"Moran\"/> Clapton and Susie were divorced by July 2012.<ref name=\"Cashmere 0712\"/> He told [[Paul Cashmere]] of ''Noise11.com'', \"I went through a really miserable divorce ... I wrote a couple of songs like 'Over the Borderline' which was a last ditch attempt to make amends with my ex-wife. The divorce got very long and drawn out. It went on for about five years which is just absurd\".<ref name=\"Cashmere 0712\"/>\n\nOn 1 August 2014 Clapton published his memoirs, ''The Best Years of Our Lives'', via [[Allen & Unwin]].<ref name=\"NLA Best Years\"/> ''[[The Observer (Gladstone)|The Observer]]''{{'}}s Tammy Lewis felt, \"[it] begins from the late 60s and continues to 1990, as he was forced to keep the word limit down... it continues to touch on intrigue, excitement and some rather PG related stories.\"<ref name=\"Lewis\"/> James Rose of ''Daily Review'', observed, \"He writes vernacular very well. Lot\u2019s of swearing and sexual exploits (mostly others, less his own).

It is located 4 km to the east of [[downtown Ottawa]] in the [[Eastway Gardens]] neighbourhood and serves inter-city trains connecting to [[Toronto]], [[Kingston, Ontario|Kingston]] and [[Montreal]] on Via Rail's [[Qu\u00e9bec City\u2013Windsor Corridor (Via Rail)|Corridor]] Route. \n\nOttawa station is connected to the [[O-Train]] light rail system at [[Tremblay station]]. It was previously served by [[OC Transpo]] buses at a [[Transitway (Ottawa)|Transitway]] station known as Train Station before light rail service commenced on September 14, 2019.\n\n==Location==\n\nOttawa station is located at '''200 [[Tremblay Road]]''', which lies directly south of [[Ontario Highway 417]] (known locally as the ''Queensway'') near Exit 117 and east of [[Riverside Drive (Ottawa)|Riverside Drive (Regional Road 19)]] in an industrial park area. Its main entrance faces north to Tremblay Road. \n\nSouth of the station building, trains call at 5 low-level [[island platform]]s and 6 tracks. The platforms are connected to the main building by an underground walkway that is accessed by a circular ramp and escalators. The tracks are bordered on the south by Terminal Avenue.\n\n[[RCGT Park]], a minor-league baseball stadium is located north of both Tremblay Road and Highway 417 and is accessible by the Max Keeping Pedestrian Bridge. The station is also within the vicinity of a number of big box stores, including the Ottawa Train Yards shopping complex south of Terminal Avenue. (However there is no pedestrian bridge over the tracks, so this can only be accessed on foot or by car via Belfast Road.) An office complex of the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] is located to the north east of the station, across the highway cloverleaf and next to the [[Rideau River]].\n\n==Structure==\n\nOttawa station is an international style building composed of exposed cantilevered [[Truss#Vierendeel truss|Vierendeel trusses]] supported by massive concrete [[Pier (architecture)|piers]]. This creates a spacious [[open plan]] interior with a powerful roofline. The station's walls are a non-loadbearing glass skin and extend through the open steel trusses to the roof deck. None of the interior walls extend above the lower chords of the trusses, allowing for an uninterrupted view of the roof structure.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706192640/http://www.orsa.ca/resources/gallery/details.asp?id=18\"|title=Ottawa Train Station  |author=Ottawa Regional Society of Architects |date= |website=www.orsa.ca}}</ref>\n\nInside, an expansive waiting area features a circular ticket office and a descending circular ramp leading to the far [[railway platform|platforms]].\n\n==History==\nThe station was designed by [[John B. Parkin|John B. Parkin & Associates]] and was built in 1966. It won a [[Governor General's Award|Massey Medal]] for architecture in 1967.

It is located 4 km to the east of [[downtown Ottawa]] in the [[Eastway Gardens]] neighbourhood and serves inter-city trains connecting to [[Toronto]], [[Kingston, Ontario|Kingston]] and [[Montreal]] on Via Rail's [[Qu\u00e9bec City\u2013Windsor Corridor (Via Rail)|Corridor]] Route. \n\nOttawa station is connected to the [[O-Train]] light rail system at [[Tremblay station]]. It was previously served by [[OC Transpo]] buses at a [[Transitway (Ottawa)|Transitway]] station known as Train Station before light rail service commenced on September 14, 2019.\n\n==Location==\n\nOttawa station is located at '''200 [[Tremblay Road]]''', which lies directly south of [[Ontario Highway 417]] (known locally as the ''Queensway'') near Exit 117 and east of [[Riverside Drive (Ottawa)|Riverside Drive (Regional Road 19)]] in an industrial park area. Its main entrance faces north to Tremblay Road. To the south of the station building are the 5 [[island platform]]s and 6 tracks bordering on Terminal Avenue. \n\n[[RCGT Park]], a minor-league baseball stadium is located north of both Tremblay Road and Highway 417 and is accessible by the Max Keeping Pedestrian Bridge. The station is also within the vicinity of a number of big box stores, including the Ottawa Train Yards shopping complex south of Terminal Avenue. (However there is no pedestrian bridge over the tracks, so this can only be accessed on foot or by car via Belfast Road.) An office complex of the [[Royal Canadian Mounted Police]] is located to the north east of the station, across the highway cloverleaf and next to the [[Rideau River]].\n\n==Structure==\n\nOttawa station is an international style building composed of exposed cantilevered [[Truss#Vierendeel truss|Vierendeel trusses]] supported by massive concrete [[Pier (architecture)|piers]]. This creates a spacious [[open plan]] interior with a powerful roofline. The station's walls are a non-loadbearing glass skin and extend through the open steel trusses to the roof deck. None of the interior walls extend above the lower chords of the trusses, allowing for an uninterrupted view of the roof structure.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706192640/http://www.orsa.ca/resources/gallery/details.asp?id=18\"|title=Ottawa Train Station  |author=Ottawa Regional Society of Architects |date= |website=www.orsa.ca}}</ref>\n\nInside, an expansive waiting area features a circular ticket office and a descending circular ramp leading to the far [[railway platform|platforms]].\n\n==History==\nThe station was designed by [[John B. Parkin|John B. Parkin & Associates]] and was built in 1966. It won a [[Governor General's Award|Massey Medal]] for architecture in 1967.

Bumpus]] hired Clark, who was known for his skill in animal sculpture. While working in the employ of John Rowley, Clark sketched animals at the [[Central Park Zoo]] and the [[Bronx Zoo]]. Bumpus wanted to develop a staff at the AMNH capable of producing the realistic, natural displays{{Sfn|Duignan|Gann|1987|p=213}} that [[Carl Akeley]] had created as Chief Taxidermist at the [[Field Museum]] from 1896 to 1909.{{Sfn|Field Museum|nd}} Akeley was considered to be the \"father of modern taxidermy\".{{Sfn|Field Museum|nd}} He was persuaded to mentor Clark and they became lifelong friends as well as colleagues.{{Sfn|Clark|1966|p=151}}{{Sfn|Duignan|Gann|1987|p=213}}\n\n{{quote|Akeley had developed a new lifelike taxidermy method in which the animal's musculature was sculpted over the skeleton.

Clark and Akeley both had great talent; they loved nature, art, and working on all things mechanical ... Clark returned to the AMNH and kept in constant communication with Akeley, adopting Akeley's taxidermy method of sculpting animals bodies, creating mannequins, and adding skin.|''Peabody Museum of Natural History 20''10 }}\n\nIn 1926, with Carl Akeley's untimely death, Clark took on the leadership role in terms of the AMNH's projects including the construction of the diorama halls, the Vernay Asiatic Hall, the Akeley African Hall, the Birds of the World and Ocean Life halls.{{Sfn|Yale Peabody Museum of Natural History|2010}}{{Sfn|National Museum of Wildlife Art|nd}} He was co-director of the Morden-Clark Asiatic expedition and for a number of years he was with Akeley in Africa. As an expert taxidermist he was responsible for some of the most notable groups that are on display in New York. He was also a sculptor and made some distinguished studies of wild animals.{{Sfn|West|1931}}\n\nIn 1934, eight years after Akeley's death, his influence was still strongly felt at the AMNH, where he was considered to be a diorama expert. Clark, [[Henry Fairfield Osborn]] and [[William R. Leigh]] were \"transforming the museum exhibits\" in the early 1930s.{{Sfn|Yale Peabody Museum of Natural History|2010}} Others included [[Francis Lee Jaques]], Robert Rockwell, [[Belmore Brown]], [[Carl Rungius]], and [[Hanson Puthuff]].{{Sfn|Yale Peabody Museum of Natural History|2010}}\n\nIn 1966 Clark published the book ''Good Hunting: Fifty Years of Collecting and Preparing Habitat Groups for the American Museum''.{{Sfn|Clark|1966|p=151}}\n\n== Dugmore-Clark safari ==\n\nClark's friend [[Arthur Radclyffe Dugmore]] was planning a photo-safari in November 1908 to photograph big game in advance of the President's much-publicized 1909-1910 [[Smithsonian\u2013Roosevelt African Expedition]]. Clark offered to join Dugmore as his bodyguard, although he had never fired a rifle in his life.{{Sfn|Yale Peabody Museum of Natural History|2010}}\n\n{{quote|The Dugmore-Clark safari was full of adventure and close scrapes photographing charging rhinos and lions prowling in the night. There was an impetuous and dangerous buffalo hunt in swamps with high grass and no visibility or cover. At another point, Clark fell ten feet into an elephant trap and miraculously missed sharp, poisoned bamboo stakes on the way down. It seems lucky indeed that Clark and Dugmore survived this first bold encounter with Africa.|''Peabody Museum of Natural History 2010''}}\n\nThe Dugmore-Clark safari overlapped with the former president's safari on several occasions. Dugmore returned to the United States in the late spring of 1909 and Clark stayed on for another six months spending time with Akeley and through him, Roosevelt.{{Sfn|Duignan|Gann|1987|p=213}}\n\n==Boy Scouts recognition==\nClark was a former president of the [[Campfire Club of America]] and in 1927, the [[Boy Scouts of America]] made Clark an ''Honorary Scout'', a new category of Scout created that same year.

Bumpus]] hired Clark, who was known for his skill in animal sculpture. While working in the employ of John Rowley, Clark sketched animals at the [[Central Park Zoo]] and the [[Bronx Zoo]]. Bumpus wanted to develop a staff at the AMNH capable of producing the realistic, natural displays{{Sfn|Duignan|Gann|1987|p=213}} that [[Carl Akeley]] had created as Chief Taxidermist at the [[Field Museum]] from 1896 to 1909.{{Sfn|Field Museum|nd}} Akeley was considered to be the \"father of modern taxidermy\".{{Sfn|Field Museum|nd}} He was persuaded to mentor Clark and they became lifelong friends as well as colleagues.{{Sfn|Clark|1966|p=151}}{{Sfn|Duignan|Gann|1987|p=213}}\n\n{{quote|Akeley had developed a new lifelike taxidermy method in which the animal's musculature was sculpted over the skeleton. A lightweight mannequin was then cast from the sculpted body and the tanned skin adhered to it. Clark and Akeley both had great talent; they loved nature, art, and working on all things mechanical ... Clark returned to the AMNH and kept in constant communication with Akeley, adopting Akeley's taxidermy method of sculpting animals bodies, creating mannequins, and adding skin.|''Peabody Museum of Natural History 20''10 }}\n\nIn 1926, with Carl Akeley's untimely death, Clark took on the leadership role in terms of the AMNH's projects including the construction of the diorama halls, the Vernay Asiatic Hall, the Akeley African Hall, the Birds of the World and Ocean Life halls.{{Sfn|Yale Peabody Museum of Natural History|2010}}{{Sfn|National Museum of Wildlife Art|nd}} He was co-director of the Morden-Clark Asiatic expedition and for a number of years he was with Akeley in Africa. As an expert taxidermist he was responsible for some of the most notable groups that are on display in New York. He was also a sculptor and made some distinguished studies of wild animals.{{Sfn|West|1931}}\n\nIn 1934, eight years after Akeley's death, his influence was still strongly felt at the AMNH, where he was considered to be a diorama expert. Clark, [[Henry Fairfield Osborn]] and [[William R. Leigh]] were \"transforming the museum exhibits\" in the early 1930s.{{Sfn|Yale Peabody Museum of Natural History|2010}} Others included [[Francis Lee Jaques]], Robert Rockwell, [[Belmore Brown]], [[Carl Rungius]], and [[Hanson Puthuff]].{{Sfn|Yale Peabody Museum of Natural History|2010}}\n\nIn 1966 Clark published the book ''Good Hunting: Fifty Years of Collecting and Preparing Habitat Groups for the American Museum''.{{Sfn|Clark|1966|p=151}}\n\n== Dugmore-Clark safari ==\n\nClark's friend [[Arthur Radclyffe Dugmore]] was planning a photo-safari in November 1908 to photograph big game in advance of the President's much-publicized 1909-1910 [[Smithsonian\u2013Roosevelt African Expedition]]. Clark offered to join Dugmore as his bodyguard, although he had never fired a rifle in his life.{{Sfn|Yale Peabody Museum of Natural History|2010}}\n\n{{quote|The Dugmore-Clark safari was full of adventure and close scrapes photographing charging rhinos and lions prowling in the night. There was an impetuous and dangerous buffalo hunt in swamps with high grass and no visibility or cover. At another point, Clark fell ten feet into an elephant trap and miraculously missed sharp, poisoned bamboo stakes on the way down. It seems lucky indeed that Clark and Dugmore survived this first bold encounter with Africa.|''Peabody Museum of Natural History 2010''}}\n\nThe Dugmore-Clark safari overlapped with the former president's safari on several occasions. Dugmore returned to the United States in the late spring of 1909 and Clark stayed on for another six months spending time with Akeley and through him, Roosevelt.{{Sfn|Duignan|Gann|1987|p=213}}\n\n==Boy Scouts recognition==\nClark was a former president of the [[Campfire Club of America]] and in 1927, the [[Boy Scouts of America]] made Clark an ''Honorary Scout'', a new category of Scout created that same year. This distinction was given to \"American citizens whose achievements in outdoor activity, exploration and worthwhile adventure are of such an exceptional character as to capture the imagination of boys ...\". The other eighteen who were awarded this distinction were [[Roy Chapman Andrews]]; [[Robert Bartlett (explorer)|Robert Bartlett]]; [[Frederick Russell Burnham]]; [[Richard E.
