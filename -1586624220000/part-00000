Both clans were very proud of the purity of their royal blood and had practised this tradition of inter-marriage since ancient times. For example, [[\u015buddhodana|Suddhodana's]] paternal aunt was married to the Koliyan ruler [[A\u00f1jana]]. Their daughters, [[Mayadevi|Mahamaya]] and [[Mahaprajapati|Mahapajapati Gotami]], were married to [[\u015auddhodana]], the chief of the [[Shakya|Sakyans]]. Similarly, [[Yashodhara]], daughter of [[Suppabuddha]], who was [[A\u00f1jana]]'s son, was married to the Sakyan prince, [[Gautama Buddha]]. Thus, the two royal families were related by marriage bonds between maternal and paternal cousins since ancient times. In spite of such close blood-ties, there would be occasional rifts between the two royal families, which sometimes turned into open hostility.\n\n=== Early ===\nRecords of Koli people exist from at least the 15th century, when rulers in the present-day Gujarat region noted their chieftains as being marauding robbers and [[dacoit]]s.

In 1650, kolis revolted against sultan [[Aurangzeb]] because of [[Jizya]] taxes on [[Zamindar]]s. It was a big turning point in the history of kolis because after this Rebellion, kolis were highly reputed in the [[Maratha Navy]], [[Maratha Army]] and [[Maratha Empire]]. This Rebellion was a good and big chance for [[Maratha emperors|Maratha Emporer]] the [[Shivaji]] to shake the aurangzeb. In 1650, kolis revolted under their koli chief ''Khemi Sarnaik'' with the supportive words of shivaji maharaj. firstly Sarnaik assembled the other koli [[Nayak (title)|Naiks]] to end the mughal rule and promised them to end the rule in only first rebellion. In the starting of revolt, kolis under Sarnaik shaked the sultan Aurangzeb but latter they were hunted by lacks of mughal soldiers. Sarnaik sought the help from shivaji maharaj but kolis were not helped by maratha emporer. The ''Khemi Sarnaik'' was killed by mughal commander thereafter the family members also were killed by the order of aurangzeb and then the kolis of same clan as Sarnaik were searched and killed. The end of koli rebellion was very haunted, thousands of the kolis were captured and taken to [[Junnar]] to the mughal [[Faujdar]] where their heads were cutoff at a one place. But latter sultan Aurangzeb erected an monument at the heads of kolis named ''<nowiki/>'Koli Chabutra''' and Jiziya tax was stopped. After this, kolis were received high positions in maratha empire such as ''Kanhoji Angre'' who was admiral of maratha navy, ''Tanaji Malusare'', a commander in maratha army and ''Suryaji Malusare, Kondaji Ramji Shelar and Lai Patil'' were notable personalities from martha army and navy.<ref name=\":10\" /><ref name=\":11\" /><ref name=\":0\" />\n\nin the later part of [[18th century]], the ''Khant Kolis'' rebelled against [[Muslims|Muslim]] rule in [[Junagadh State]] whose ruler was faujdar of mughals. The kolis of [[Junagadh]] revolted under a khant koli named ''Mansa Khant'' who shaked the junagadh government and muslim ruler. The [[Nawab]] of junagadh was unable to prevent the khant kolis. Mansa khant captured the [[Uparkot Fort]] from nawab. After this occurance, nawab sought the help from [[Rajput]] ruler of [[Gondal State]] and the British government to put down the kolis thereafter combined forces of the british, junagadh and gondal attacked the uparkot fort and burnt the koli rebellion.<ref name=\":14\" /><ref name=\":15\" />\n\nThe kolis continued to their fight, a similar rebellion also mentioned in the pages of history of maharashtra. In 1761, kolis of [[Sahyadri]] revolted against [[Nizam of Hyderabad]]. A storming party of kolis under their chiefs ''Gamaji Bhangre and Kheroji Pattikar'' captured the [[Trimbak|Trimbak Fort]] from [[Hyderabad State]] and annexed the fort in maratha Empire. It shows the contributions of kolis in the standing of maratha empire thereafter both of the koli chiefs were rewarded with the grants of a large sum of money and many villages with the titles of [[Deshmukh]] and [[Patil (title)|Patil]] by [[Peshwa]].<ref name=\":11\" /><ref>{{Cite book|last=The Executive Editor And Secretary|first=Gazetteers Department|url=http://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.7537|title=Maharastra State Gazetteers Ahmednagar District|date=1976}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cultural.maharashtra.gov.in/english/gazetteer/Ahmadnagar/people_castes.html|title=Maharashtra government|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nAt the beginning of [[19th century]] in 1803, there was a koli rebellion against [[East India Company]] in [[Kheda district]]. The british officials declared the dharala kolis most turbulent and predatory tribe of india. They kolis of kheda didn't obey the rules of British government and plundered the villages and towns in British territory and claimed a costmary right to plunder the villages like their forfathers. The district magistrate informed the officials that plundering right in not new to kolis it is a traditional way of collecting the tax from villages from ancient time of kolis. In 1808, koli chiefs such as ''Koli Thakors and Koli Patels'' started the invading the villages and stealing the crops and other possessions mostly in the [[Dholka Taluka]] and neighboring villages of british Territory with the groups of the hundreds of the armed kolis without any difficulties. On February 1808, one of the koli named ''Bachur Khokani'' was captured and imprisoned but on 20 February, fifty kolis attacked the jail and released the rebel Khokani by killing the police officers in the battle. Thereafter, british official ''R. Holford'' made a plane to raised a army of non-koli locals for [[East India Company|EIC]] to prevent the koli rebels. In 1810, a large number of koli rebels were captured and convicted to the crim against company. The kolis were taken to the [[Prince of Wales Islands]] ([[Penang]]) in the recommendation of judge ''H. W. Riggle'' of british cutchery but some rebels were imprisoned in local jails. A group of koli rebels numbering five hundred under ''Koli Bachur Khokani'' attacked the jails and released the rebels it was most daring event in the [[History of Gujarat]]. Again kolis ravaged the dholka and british stationed the more army but no control on kolis. The company sought the help from [[Baroda State]] of [[Gaekwad dynasty|Gaekwads]] but not able to prevent the rebels so company forced the non-koli local chiefs but there was no goid result. In 1824, the [[Ahmedabad]] magistrate ''A. Crawford'' suggested the company to take the possessions of koli chiefs ([[Thakur (title)|Thakors]]) because of involving or supporting the/in koli rebellion. But nobody of the koli chiefs were feared thereafter company used the military against koli chieftains and burnt down their villages and this strategy became more useful for company. The idea of destroying the villages of ''A. Crawford'' didn't prevent the kolis from challenging the company rule but kolis became more turbulent and continued to the rebellion. In 1830, ''Crawford'' made policies for kolis but koli chieftains not seems to be improved but always ready to plunder but in 1840 kolis involved in agriculture.<ref name=\":17\" />\n\nAfter the muslim rule, kolis ravaged the [[British Raj]] in [[British India]]. Here is a historical rebellion of kolis which was led by a koli [[Bhagat]] named [[Govindas Ramdas]] who was a worshiper of lord [[Rama]] and [[Krishna]].

Both clans were very proud of the purity of their royal blood and had practised this tradition of inter-marriage since ancient times. For example, [[\u015buddhodana|Suddhodana's]] paternal aunt was married to the Koliyan ruler [[A\u00f1jana]]. Their daughters, [[Mayadevi|Mahamaya]] and [[Mahaprajapati|Mahapajapati Gotami]], were married to [[\u015auddhodana]], the chief of the [[Shakya|Sakyans]]. Similarly, [[Yashodhara]], daughter of [[Suppabuddha]], who was [[A\u00f1jana]]'s son, was married to the Sakyan prince, [[Gautama Buddha]]. Thus, the two royal families were related by marriage bonds between maternal and paternal cousins since ancient times. In spite of such close blood-ties, there would be occasional rifts between the two royal families, which sometimes turned into open hostility.\n\n=== Early ===\nRecords of Koli people exist from at least the 15th century, when rulers in the present-day Gujarat region noted their chieftains as being marauding robbers and [[dacoit]]s. According to the historical anthropology [[Susan Bayly]] of [[University of Cambridge]] states that this is the [[Kshatriya]] of [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]] and uppar [[India]]. Until tye 1940, kolis were considered as criminal stocks and mostly used for police and military by rulers and authorities.

In 1650, kolis revolted against sultan [[Aurangzeb]] because of [[Jizya]] taxes on [[Zamindar]]s. It was a big turning point in the history of kolis because after this Rebellion, kolis were highly reputed in the [[Maratha Navy]], [[Maratha Army]] and [[Maratha Empire]]. This Rebellion was a good and big chance for [[Maratha emperors|Maratha Emporer]] the [[Shivaji]] to shake the aurangzeb. In 1650, kolis revolted under their koli chief ''Khemi Sarnaik'' with the supportive words of shivaji maharaj. firstly Sarnaik assembled the other koli [[Nayak (title)|Naiks]] to end the mughal rule and promised them to end the rule in only first rebellion. In the starting of revolt, kolis under Sarnaik shaked the sultan Aurangzeb but latter they were hunted by lacks of mughal soldiers. Sarnaik sought the help from shivaji maharaj but kolis were not helped by maratha emporer. The ''Khemi Sarnaik'' was killed by mughal commander thereafter the family members also were killed by the order of aurangzeb and then the kolis of same clan as Sarnaik were searched and killed. The end of koli rebellion was very haunted, thousands of the kolis were captured and taken to [[Junnar]] to the mughal [[Faujdar]] where their heads were cutoff at a one place. But latter sultan Aurangzeb erected an monument at the heads of kolis named ''<nowiki/>'Koli Chabutra''' and Jiziya tax was stopped. After this, kolis were received high positions in maratha empire such as ''Kanhoji Angre'' who was admiral of maratha navy, ''Tanaji Malusare'', a commander in maratha army and ''Suryaji Malusare, Kondaji Ramji Shelar and Lai Patil'' were notable personalities from martha army and navy.<ref name=\":10\" /><ref name=\":11\" /><ref name=\":0\" />\n\nin the later part of [[18th century]], the ''Khant Kolis'' rebelled against [[Muslims|Muslim]] rule in [[Junagadh State]] whose ruler was faujdar of mughals. The kolis of [[Junagadh]] revolted under a khant koli named ''Mansa Khant'' who shaked the junagadh government and muslim ruler. The [[Nawab]] of junagadh was unable to prevent the khant kolis. Mansa khant captured the [[Uparkot Fort]] from nawab. After this occurance, nawab sought the help from [[Rajput]] ruler of [[Gondal State]] and the British government to put down the kolis thereafter combined forces of the british, junagadh and gondal attacked the uparkot fort and burnt the koli rebellion.<ref name=\":14\" /><ref name=\":15\" />\n\nThe kolis continued to their fight, a similar rebellion also mentioned in the pages of history of maharashtra. In 1761, kolis of [[Sahyadri]] revolted against [[Nizam of Hyderabad]]. A storming party of kolis under their chiefs ''Gamaji Bhangre and Kheroji Pattikar'' captured the [[Trimbak|Trimbak Fort]] from [[Hyderabad State]] and annexed the fort in maratha Empire. It shows the contributions of kolis in the standing of maratha empire thereafter both of the koli chiefs were rewarded with the grants of a large sum of money and many villages with the titles of [[Deshmukh]] and [[Patil (title)|Patil]] by [[Peshwa]].<ref name=\":11\" /><ref>{{Cite book|last=The Executive Editor And Secretary|first=Gazetteers Department|url=http://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.7537|title=Maharastra State Gazetteers Ahmednagar District|date=1976}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cultural.maharashtra.gov.in/english/gazetteer/Ahmadnagar/people_castes.html|title=Maharashtra government|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\nAt the beginning of [[19th century]] in 1803, there was a koli rebellion against [[East India Company]] in [[Kheda district]]. The british officials declared the dharala kolis most turbulent and predatory tribe of india. They kolis of kheda didn't obey the rules of British government and plundered the villages and towns in British territory and claimed a costmary right to plunder the villages like their forfathers. The district magistrate informed the officials that plundering right in not new to kolis it is a traditional way of collecting the tax from villages from ancient time of kolis. In 1808, koli chiefs such as ''Koli Thakors and Koli Patels'' started the invading the villages and stealing the crops and other possessions mostly in the [[Dholka Taluka]] and neighboring villages of british Territory with the groups of the hundreds of the armed kolis without any difficulties. On February 1808, one of the koli named ''Bachur Khokani'' was captured and imprisoned but on 20 February, fifty kolis attacked the jail and released the rebel Khokani by killing the police officers in the battle. Thereafter, british official ''R. Holford'' made a plane to raised a army of non-koli locals for [[East India Company|EIC]] to prevent the koli rebels. In 1810, a large number of koli rebels were captured and convicted to the crim against company. The kolis were taken to the [[Prince of Wales Islands]] ([[Penang]]) in the recommendation of judge ''H. W. Riggle'' of british cutchery but some rebels were imprisoned in local jails. A group of koli rebels numbering five hundred under ''Koli Bachur Khokani'' attacked the jails and released the rebels it was most daring event in the [[History of Gujarat]]. Again kolis ravaged the dholka and british stationed the more army but no control on kolis. The company sought the help from [[Baroda State]] of [[Gaekwad dynasty|Gaekwads]] but not able to prevent the rebels so company forced the non-koli local chiefs but there was no goid result. In 1824, the [[Ahmedabad]] magistrate ''A. Crawford'' suggested the company to take the possessions of koli chiefs ([[Thakur (title)|Thakors]]) because of involving or supporting the/in koli rebellion. But nobody of the koli chiefs were feared thereafter company used the military against koli chieftains and burnt down their villages and this strategy became more useful for company. The idea of destroying the villages of ''A. Crawford'' didn't prevent the kolis from challenging the company rule but kolis became more turbulent and continued to the rebellion. In 1830, ''Crawford'' made policies for kolis but koli chieftains not seems to be improved but always ready to plunder but in 1840 kolis involved in agriculture.<ref name=\":17\" />\n\nAfter the muslim rule, kolis ravaged the [[British Raj]] in [[British India]]. Here is a historical rebellion of kolis which was led by a koli [[Bhagat]] named [[Govindas Ramdas]] who was a worshiper of lord [[Rama]] and [[Krishna]]. He led his followers (most of them were kolis) against british government. He declared the end of british rule in india and declined to obey the orders. On 17 march 1826, Bhagat marched to the [[Thasra]] near [[Dakor]]e with armed kolis. There were no difficulties for rebels and ''Govindas Ramdas'' proclaimed himself as ruler (''Koli Thakor)'' of Thasra. <ref name=\":17\">{{Cite book|last=Chaturvedi|first=Vinayak|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=MzPlZSOjCpsC&pg=PA90&redir_esc=y#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Peasant Pasts: History and Memory in Western India|date=2007|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-25076-5|language=en}}</ref> he led the kolis 1826 to 1830 as a ruler.<ref name=\":16\" />\n\nDuring the ''Great [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]],'' the kolis of [[Nashik district]] in [[Maharashtra]] rebelled in the ''Petty Princely State Of [[Peint]]'' also spelled ''Penth and Peth .'' peint was a [[Jagir]]'' '' of twenty four vilages and ruled by koli king ''Bhagvant Rao'' also knowns as ''Bhargav Rav .''<ref>{{Cite book|last=Deshpande|first=Arvind M.|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=79sS_w_bOQYC&pg=PA154&lpg=PA154&dq=Koli+Raja+Peint&source=bl&ots=Vf7J9ivfZy&sig=ACfU3U3qQfAfE5epilPBBXeDIE0DOCmSvQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwit3crjnt_oAhU9H7cAHd_1AcYQ6AEwDnoECAgQAQ#v=onepage&q=Koli%20Raja%20Peint&f=false|title=John Briggs in Maharashtra: A Study of District Administration Under Early British Rule|date=1987|publisher=Mittal Publications|language=en}}</ref> the rebellion was raised by it's koli chief, queen and her [[Dewan|Diwan]]'' '' in the lead of ''Bhagojee Naik and Bhow Patel Malekar'' (both koli) to collapse the british rule.

Each question is designed to ask about symptoms of obsessive compulsive behavior, though the exact breakdown of questions is unknown{{how|date=December 2018}}. For each question, children rate the degree to which the question applies on a scale of 0-4. Based on research, this assessment has been found to be statistically [[Validity (statistics)|valid]] and [[Reliability (statistics)|reliable]],<ref>{{cite journal|last2=Storch|first2=EA|last3=Merlo|first3=LJ|last4=Ricketts|first4=ED|last5=Geffken|first5=GR|last6=Goodman|first6=WK|last7=Murphy|first7=TK|date=December 2008|title=Convergent and discriminant validity of the Children's Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale-Symptom Checklist.|journal=Journal of Anxiety Disorders|volume=22|issue=8|pages=1369\u201376|doi=10.1016/j.janxdis.2008.01.017|pmid=18329843|last1=Gallant|first1=J}}</ref> but not necessarily helpful.\n\n=== Other versions ===\nThe CY-BOCS has been adapted into several self- and parent-report versions, designed to be completed by parent and child working together, although most have not been psychometrically validated. However, these versions still ask the child to rate the severity of their obsessive compulsive behaviors and the degree to which each has been impairing. While this measure has been found to be useful in a clinic setting, scores and interpretations are taken with a grain of salt, given the lack of validation.<ref name=\"PiacentiniEtAl2007\">{{cite book|title=Cognitive-Behavioral Treatment of Childhood OCD: It's Only a False Alarm Therapist Guide|last2=Langley|first2=A|last3=Roblek|first3=T|date=2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195310511|last1=Piacentini|first1=J}}</ref>\n\nAnother version, which is parent-focused, is similar to the original CY-BOCS and is administered to both parent and child by the clinician. This version was distributed by [[Solvay S.A.|Solvay Pharmaceuticals]] in the late 1990s, creating an association between the measure and a number of pharmaceutical groups that has caused it to be avoided by most clinicians.

The Treaty of Friendship and protected state status ended in 1970 under arrangements established prior to her death by the third monarch, Queen [[Salote Tupou III|S\u0101lote]].\n\nAn unspoken agreement of the treaty that was common in British Protectorate states was a new British monopoly on Tonga's thriving vanilla industry, and their small deposits of minerals.\n\nOn 18 May 1900, to discourage German advances,<ref>http://www.britannica.com/place/Tonga/History</ref> the [[Kingdom of Tonga]] became a [[British protectorates|Protected State]] with the United Kingdom under a Treaty of Friendship signed by [[George Tupou II]] after European settlers and rival Tongan chiefs attempted to overthrow him.<ref>http://famousdaily.com/history/tonga-protectorate-uk.html</ref><ref>http://www.infoplease.com/country/tonga.html</ref> \nForeign affairs of the Kingdom of Tonga were conducted through the British [[Consul (representative)|Consul]]. The United Kingdom had veto power over foreign policies and finances of the Kingdom of Tonga.<ref>http://www.britannica.com/place/Tonga/History</ref>\n\nTonga was affected by the [[1918 flu pandemic]], with 1,800 Tongans killed, around eight per cent of the residents.<ref>{{Cite book | first = George C. | last = Kohn | title = Encyclopedia of plague and pestilence: from ancient times to the present | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=tzRwRmb09rgC&pg=PA363 | publisher = Infobase Publishing | year = 2008 | page = 363 | isbn = 0-8160-6935-2}}\n</ref>\n\nFor most of the 20th century [[Tonga]] was quiet, inward-looking, and somewhat isolated from developments elsewhere in the world. Tonga's complex social structure is essentially broken into three tiers: the [[King of Tonga|king]], the nobles, and the commoners. Between the nobles and commoners are Matapule, sometimes called \"talking chiefs,\" who are associated with the king or a noble and who may or may not hold estates. Obligations and responsibilities are reciprocal, and although the nobility are able to extract favors from people living on their estates, they likewise must extend favors to their people.

The Treaty of Friendship and protected state status ended in 1970 under arrangements established prior to her death by the third monarch, Queen [[Salote Tupou III|S\u0101lote]].\n\nAn unspoken agreement of the treaty that was common in British Protectorate states was a new British monopoly on Tonga's thriving vanilla industry, and their small deposits of minerals.\n\nOn 18 May 1900, to discourage German advances,<ref>http://www.britannica.com/place/Tonga/History</ref> the [[Kingdom of Tonga]] became a [[British protectorates|Protected State]] with the United Kingdom under a Treaty of Friendship signed by [[George Tupou II]] after European settlers and rival Tongan chiefs attempted to overthrow him.<ref>http://famousdaily.com/history/tonga-protectorate-uk.html</ref><ref>http://www.infoplease.com/country/tonga.html</ref> \nForeign affairs of the Kingdom of Tonga were conducted though the British [[Consul (representative)|Consul]]. The United Kingdom had veto power over foreign policies and finances of the Kingdom of Tonga.<ref>http://www.britannica.com/place/Tonga/History</ref>\n\nTonga was affected by the [[1918 flu pandemic]], with 1,800 Tongans killed, around eight per cent of the residents.<ref>{{Cite book | first = George C. | last = Kohn | title = Encyclopedia of plague and pestilence: from ancient times to the present | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=tzRwRmb09rgC&pg=PA363 | publisher = Infobase Publishing | year = 2008 | page = 363 | isbn = 0-8160-6935-2}}\n</ref>\n\nFor most of the 20th century [[Tonga]] was quiet, inward-looking, and somewhat isolated from developments elsewhere in the world. Tonga's complex social structure is essentially broken into three tiers: the [[King of Tonga|king]], the nobles, and the commoners. Between the nobles and commoners are Matapule, sometimes called \"talking chiefs,\" who are associated with the king or a noble and who may or may not hold estates. Obligations and responsibilities are reciprocal, and although the nobility are able to extract favors from people living on their estates, they likewise must extend favors to their people. Status and rank play a powerful role in personal relationships, even within families.\n\nOn 4 June 1970, protected state status of the Kingdom of Tonga ended.

The book represents an imagined exhibit, curated by Ann Marie Pena, at the imagined gallery the Road at the Top of the World Museum.

Finally, when the book was released in 2014 Williamson did her first gallery in nearly seven years. The exhibit, entitled \u201cI Could See Everything\u201d was shown at Mulherin + Pollard in New York City\u2019s Lower East Side. \n\n== Exhibitions<ref name=\":13\" />==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The movie was produced by Julia Rosenberg of January Films, the photography and images were done by Lee Towndrow and the music was by Steve Kado. <ref name=\":6\" /> The film was first previewed at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]] in 2008.<ref name=\":6\" /><ref name=\":7\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.margauxwilliamson.com/teenager-hamlet|title=Teenager Hamlet|last=(n.a)|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> Later in 2010, there was a DVD version that was released with Canada\u2019s KRK Media.<ref name=\":7\" /> Additionally, in 2012 the Art Gallery of Ontario previewed a different version. <ref name=\":7\" /> A final screening happened in 2013 at Brooklyn\u2019s Union Docs.\n==== \"I Could See Everything\" ====\nIn 2007, after major exhibitions in [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[Los Angeles]] Williamson decided to stop exhibiting her work in galleries in order to see, \u201cwhere the paintings would go when I gave them all the time in the world\u201d .<ref name=\":8\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.vogue.com/article/margaux-williamson-mulherin-pollard-paintings|title=Margaux Williamson Imagines Her Paintings in a Museum at the Top of the World|last=Force|first=Thessaly|date=May 8, 2014|website=VOGUE|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> In 2009, Williamson was the artist in residence at the [https://kiac.ca/ Klondike Institute for Arts & Culture] in the [[Yukon|Yukon,]] which is where she first came up with the idea for her book \u201cI Could See Everything\u201d.<ref name=\":3\" /> Rather than exhibiting her work in a real gallery, Williamson decided to publish an imaginary exhibit catalogue. The book represents an imagined exhibit, curated by Ann Marie Pena, at the imagined gallery the Road at the Top of the World Museum. The museum is supposedly located in [[Dawson City]], Yukon, and the title was inspired by Alaska\u2019s [[Top of the World Highway|Yukon Highway 9]] or the \u201cTop of the World Highway\u201d.\n \nIn order to focus and work on the paintings which would eventually be featured in the book, Williamson moved to the Yukon for an extended period of time. <ref name=\":8\" /> The book\u2019s title \u201cI Could See Everything\u201d refers to the limitations and opportunities provided by working in the extreme solitude of the Yukon, \u201cI was picturing working away in the studio in the Yukon, seeing the world through the Internet, newspapers, books\u2014trying to see what the world looked like in that way\". <ref name=\":8\" /> This influence of popular culture can be seen in works such as \u201cI saw the whole universe (Scarlett Johansson in Versace)\u201d. The \u201cexhibition\u201d included 46 paintings, most of which are oil on wood and featured, \u201cstill lifes, heads, hands, torsos and prone figures\u201d. <ref name=\":1\" /> The book features five different \u201cgalleries\u201d which all feature an accompanying essay by Williamson\u2019s friends, collaborators, and authors such as Leanne Shapton and Chris Kraus.\n \nThe process of creating this exhibit / book took Margaux almost six years. Finally, when the book was released in 2014 Williamson did her first gallery in nearly seven years. The exhibit, entitled \u201cI Could See Everything\u201d was shown at Mulherin + Pollard in New York City\u2019s Lower East Side. \n\n== Exhibitions<ref name=\":13\" />==\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

After her residency, she again returned to the Yukon while she was working on her film \u201cTeenager Hamlet\u201d. <ref name=\":10\">{{Cite web|url=https://uniondocs.org/auto-mechanic-ulysses-and-teenager-hamlet-with-margaux-williamson/|title=Auto Mechanic Ulysses and Teenager Hamlet with Margaux Williamson|last=Bugge|first=Maja|date=April 9, 2013|website=UNDO|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref> There, without a computer or real access to the outside world, she was able to rewrite and finalize the film\u2019s script.<ref name=\":10\" />\n\n=== Art Gallery of Ontario ===\nWilliamson was the second artist in residency at the Art Gallery of Ontario from January 2012 to March 2012. Williamson spent eight weeks in the Anne Lind Studio, where she studied and examined concepts including, \u201cavoidance, conflict, compromise and the notion of establishing a sense of place\".  <ref name=\":11\">{{Cite web|url=https://ago.ca/artist-in-residence/margaux-williamson|title=Artist-in-Residence - Margaux Williamson|website=Art Gallery of Ontario|language=en|access-date=2020-03-21}}</ref> Williamson examined these four concepts through videos and painting. During her residency, one of the works Williamson created was \u201cHow to Act in Real Life\u201d a new and still on-going performance art series. <ref name=\":11\" /> This work was a collaboration with Sheila Heti, it was a public and performance piece where Williamson instructed Heti on how \u201cto act in the real world\u201d . <ref name=\":11\" /> Williamson and Heti would act out this performance in a circle like setting, which was open to the audience  to join and interact in. Another piece of work Williamson showcased was a series of \u201creal art of tv\u201d, called \u201cBack to the World\u201d. The screening of this piece took place between 3pm and midnight. Williamson once again engaged with her audience, this time by inviting them to bring their own sleeping bags and pillows to the showing. <ref name=\":11\" /> Other programs Williamson developed during her residency were Teenager Hamlet, I\u2019m a Very Sexy Baby and a  performance by Tomboyfriend.<ref name=\":11\" />\n== Awards ==\nIn April 2013, Partners in Art won the MOCCA Award ([[Museum of Contemporary Art]]), it was a $25,000 prize.<ref name=\":12\">{{Cite web|url=https://partnersinart.ca/projects/mocca-award-commissioned-videos/|title=MOCA Award: Commissioned Videos|website=Partners in Art|language=en|access-date=2020-03-21}}</ref>  The award recognizes an individual's achievements in the visual art realm.
