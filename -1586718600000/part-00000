{"title_page": "Winkler test for dissolved oxygen", "text_new": "The '''Winkler test''' is used to determine the concentration of [[dissolved oxygen]] in water samples. Dissolved oxygen (D.O.) is widely used in water quality studies and routine operation of water reclamation facilities to analyze its level of [[oxygen saturation]].\n\nIn the test, an excess of manganese(II) salt, iodide (I<sup>\u2212</sup>) and hydroxide (OH<sup>\u2212</sup>) ions are added to a water sample causing a white [[precipitate]] of Mn(OH)<sub>2</sub> to form.  This precipitate is then oxidized by the [[oxygen]] that is present in the water sample into a brown [[manganese]]-containing precipitate with manganese in a more highly-oxidized state (either Mn(III) or Mn(IV)).\n\nIn the next step, a strong acid (either [[hydrochloric acid]] or [[sulfuric acid]]) is added to acidify the solution.  The brown precipitate then converts the iodide ion (I<sup>\u2212</sup>) to [[iodine]].  The amount of dissolved oxygen is directly proportional to the titration of iodine with a [[thiosulfate]] solution.<ref name=\"Numako\">{{cite journal |author=Chiya Numako and Izumi Nakai |title= XAFS studies of some precipitation and coloration reaction used in analytical chemistry |journal =Physica B: Condensed Matter |volume=208\u2013209 |pages=387\u2013388 |year=1995 | doi=10.1016/0921-4526(94)00706-2 |bibcode=1995PhyB..208..387N }}</ref>  Today, the method is effectively used as its colorimetric modification, where the trivalent manganese produced on acidifying the brown suspension is directly reacted with [[EDTA]] to give a pink color.<ref>A.

Quim., 1963, 5, 15</ref> As manganese is the only common metal giving a color reaction with EDTA, it has the added effect of masking other metals as colorless complexes.\n\n==History==\nThe test was originally developed by Ludwig Wilhelm Winkler, in later literature referred to as [[Lajos Winkler]], while working at Budapest University on his doctoral dissertation in 1888.<ref>{{cite journal | author = [[Lajos Winkler]] | title = Die Bestimmung des in Wasser Gel\u00f6sten Sauerstoffes | journal = Berichte der Deutschen Chemischen Gesellschaft | year = 1888 | volume = 21 | issue = 2 | pages = 2843\u20132855 | url = http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k90715s/f46.chemindefer | doi = 10.1002/cber.188802102122}}</ref> The amount of dissolved oxygen is a measure of the biological activity of the water masses. [[Phytoplankton]] and macroalgae present in the water mass-produce oxygen by way of [[photosynthesis]].  [[Bacteria]] and eukaryotic organisms (zooplankton,fish) consume this oxygen through [[cellular respiration]]. The result of these two mechanisms determines the concentration of dissolved oxygen, which in turn indicates the production of biomass. The difference between the physical concentration of oxygen in the water (or the theoretical concentration if there were no living organisms) and the actual concentration of oxygen is called the biochemical demand in oxygen. The Winkler test is often controversial as it is not 100% accurate and the oxygen levels may fluctuate from test to test despite using the same constant sample.\n\n==Chemical processes==\n\nIn the first step, [[manganese(II) sulphate]] (at 48% of the total volume) is added to an environmental water sample.  Next, [[potassium iodide]] (15% in [[potassium hydroxide]] 70%) is added to create a pinkish-brown precipitate.  In the alkaline solution, dissolved oxygen will oxidize manganese(II) ions to the [[tetravalent]] state.\n\n: 2 Mn<sup>2+</sup><sub>(aq)</sub>+ O<sub>2(aq)</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>(l)</sub>  \u2192 2 MnO(OH)<sub>2(s)</sub>\n\nMn has been oxidised to 4+, and MnO(OH)<sub>2</sub> appears as a brown precipitate.  There is some uncertainty about whether the oxidised manganese is tetravalent or [[Electron shell|trivalent]]. Some sources claim that Mn(OH)<sub>3</sub> is the brown precipitate, but hydrated MnO<sub>2</sub> may also give the brown colour.\n\n: 4 Mn(OH)<sub>2</sub>(s) + O<sub>2</sub>(aq) + 2 H<sub>2</sub>O \u2192 4 Mn(OH)<sub>3</sub>(s)\n\nThe second part of the Winkler test reduces (acidifies) the solution.  The precipitate will dissolve back into solution as the H<sup>+</sup> reacts with the O<sup>2\u2212</sup> and OH<sup>\u2212</sup> to form water.\n\n: MnO(OH)<sub>2(s)</sub> +4H<sup>+</sup><sub>(aq)</sub> \u2192 Mn<sup>4+</sup><sub>(aq)</sub> + 3 H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>(l)</sub>\n\nThe acid facilitates the conversion by the brown, Manganese-containing precipitate of the Iodide ion into elemental Iodine.\n\nThe Mn(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub> formed by the acid converts the iodide ions into [[iodine]], itself being reduced back to manganese(II) ions in an acidic medium.\n\n: Mn(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub> + 2 I<sup>\u2212</sup>(aq) \u2192  Mn<sup>2+</sup>(aq) + I<sub>2</sub>(aq) + 2 SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2\u2212</sup>(aq)\n\nThiosulfate  is used, with a starch indicator, to [[titrate]] the iodine.\n\n: 2 S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub><sup>2\u2212</sup>(aq) + I<sub>2</sub> \u2192 S<sub>4</sub>O<sub>6</sub><sup>2\u2212</sup>(aq) + 2 I<sup>\u2212</sup>(aq)\n\n==Analysis==\n\nFrom the above [[stoichiometric]] equations, we can find that:\n\n:1 mole of O<sub>2</sub> \u2192 2 moles of MnO(OH)<sub>2</sub> \u2192 2 mole of I<sub>2</sub> \u2192 4 mole of  S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub><sup>2\u2212</sup>\n\nTherefore, after determining the number of moles of iodine produced, we can work out the number of moles of oxygen molecules present in the original water sample. The oxygen content is usually presented in milligrams per liter (mg/L).\n\n==Limitations==\n\nThe success of this method is critically dependent upon the manner in which the sample is manipulated. At all stages, steps must be taken to ensure that oxygen is neither introduced to nor lost from the sample. Furthermore, the water sample must be free of any [[Solution|solutes]] that will [[oxidize]] or [[redox|reduce]] iodine.\n\nInstrumental methods for measurement of dissolved oxygen have widely supplanted the routine use of the Winkler test, although the test is still used to check instrument calibration.\n\n==BOD<sub>5</sub>==\n\nTo determine five-day [[biochemical oxygen demand]] (BOD<sub>5</sub>), several dilutions of a sample are analyzed for dissolved oxygen before and after a five-day incubation period at 20&nbsp;\u00b0C in the dark. In some cases, bacteria are used to provide a standardized community to uptake oxygen while consuming the organic matter in the sample; these bacteria are known as \"seed\". The difference in DO and the dilution factor are used to calculated BOD<sub>5</sub>. The resulting number (usually reported in parts per million or milligrams per liter) is useful in determining the relative organic strength of sewage or other polluted waters.\n\nThe BOD<sub>5</sub> test is an example of analysis that determines classes of materials in a sample.\n\n==Winkler bottle==\n\nA Winkler bottle is a piece of [[laboratory glassware]] specifically made for carrying out the Winkler test.  These bottles have conical tops and a close fitting stopper to aid in the exclusion of air bubbles when the top is sealed.  This is important because oxygen in trapped air would be included in the measurement and would affect the accuracy of the test.<ref>Whitney King, [http://web.colby.edu/colbyatsea/2011/02/11/winkler-titrations-measuring-dissolved-oxygen/ \"Winkler titrations \u2013 measuring dissolved oxygen\"], ''Colby at Sea'', 11 February 2011, retrieved and [https://www.webcitation.org/695OXDEfl archived] 11 July 2012.</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Wikibooks|School Science|Winkler test for dissolved oxygen}}\n* Moran, Joseph M.; Morgan, Michael D., & Wiersma, James H.

Dissolved oxygen (D.O.) is widely used in water quality studies and routine operation of water reclamation facilities to analyze its level of [[oxygen saturation]].\n\nIn the test, an excess of manganese(II) salt, iodide (I<sup>\u2212</sup>) and hydroxide (OH<sup>\u2212</sup>) ions are added to a water sample causing a white [[precipitate]] of Mn(OH)<sub>2</sub> to form.  This precipitate is then oxidized by the [[oxygen]] that is present in the water sample into a brown [[manganese]]-containing precipitate with manganese in a more highly-oxidized state (either Mn(III) or Mn(IV)).\n\nIn the next step, a strong acid (either [[hydrochloric acid]] or [[sulfuric acid]]) is added to acidify the solution.  The brown precipitate then converts the iodide ion (I<sup>\u2212</sup>) to [[iodine]].  The amount of dissolved oxygen is directly proportional to the titration of iodine with a [[thiosulfate]] solution.<ref name=\"Numako\">{{cite journal |author=Chiya Numako and Izumi Nakai |title= XAFS studies of some precipitation and coloration reaction used in analytical chemistry |journal =Physica B: Condensed Matter |volume=208\u2013209 |pages=387\u2013388 |year=1995 | doi=10.1016/0921-4526(94)00706-2 |bibcode=1995PhyB..208..387N }}</ref>  Today, the method is effectively used as its colorimetric modification, where the trivalent manganese produced on acidifying the brown suspension is directly reacted with [[EDTA]] to give a pink color.<ref>A.

Quim., 1963, 5, 15</ref> As manganese is the only common metal giving a color reaction with EDTA, it has the added effect of masking other metals as colorless complexes.\n\n==History==\nThe test was originally developed by Ludwig Wilhelm Winkler, in later literature referred to as [[Lajos Winkler]], while working at Budapest University on his doctoral dissertation in 1888.<ref>{{cite journal | author = [[Lajos Winkler]] | title = Die Bestimmung des in Wasser Gel\u00f6sten Sauerstoffes | journal = Berichte der Deutschen Chemischen Gesellschaft | year = 1888 | volume = 21 | issue = 2 | pages = 2843\u20132855 | url = http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k90715s/f46.chemindefer | doi = 10.1002/cber.188802102122}}</ref> The amount of dissolved oxygen is a measure of the biological activity of the water masses. [[Phytoplankton]] and macroalgae present in the water mass-produce oxygen by way of [[photosynthesis]].  [[Bacteria]] and eukaryotic organisms (zooplankton,fish) consume this oxygen through [[cellular respiration]]. The result of these two mechanisms determines the concentration of dissolved oxygen, which in turn indicates the production of biomass. The difference between the physical concentration of oxygen in the water (or the theoretical concentration if there were no living organisms) and the actual concentration of oxygen is called the biochemical demand in oxygen. The Winkler test is often controversial as it is not 100% accurate and the oxygen levels may fluctuate from test to test despite using the same constant sample.\n\n==Chemical processes==\n\nIn the first step, [[manganese(II) sulphate]] (at 48% of the total volume) is added to an environmental water sample.  Next, [[potassium iodide]] (15% in [[potassium hydroxide]] 70%) is added to create a pinkish-brown precipitate.  In the alkaline solution, dissolved oxygen will oxidize manganese(II) ions to the [[tetravalent]] state.\n\n: 2 Mn<sup>+</sup><sub>(aq)</sub>+ O<sub>2(aq)</sub> + H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>(l)</sub>  \u2192 2 MnO(OH)<sub>2(s)</sub>\n\nMn has been oxidised to 4+, and MnO(OH)<sub>2</sub> appears as a brown precipitate.  There is some uncertainty about whether the oxidised manganese is tetravalent or [[Electron shell|trivalent]]. Some sources claim that Mn(OH)<sub>3</sub> is the brown precipitate, but hydrated MnO<sub>2</sub> may also give the brown colour.\n\n: 4 Mn(OH)<sub>2</sub>(s) + O<sub>2</sub>(aq) + 2 H<sub>2</sub>O \u2192 4 Mn(OH)<sub>3</sub>(s)\n\nThe second part of the Winkler test reduces (acidifies) the solution.  The precipitate will dissolve back into solution as the H<sup>+</sup> reacts with the O<sup>2\u2212</sup> and OH<sup>\u2212</sup> to form water.\n\n: MnO(OH)<sub>2(s)</sub> +4H<sup>+</sup><sub>(aq)</sub> \u2192 Mn<sup>4+</sup><sub>(aq)</sub> + 3 H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>(l)</sub>\n\nThe acid facilitates the conversion by the brown, Manganese-containing precipitate of the Iodide ion into elemental Iodine.\n\nThe Mn(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub> formed by the acid converts the iodide ions into [[iodine]], itself being reduced back to manganese(II) ions in an acidic medium.\n\n: Mn(SO<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub> + 2 I<sup>\u2212</sup>(aq) \u2192  Mn<sup>2+</sup>(aq) + I<sub>2</sub>(aq) + 2 SO<sub>4</sub><sup>2\u2212</sup>(aq)\n\nThiosulfate  is used, with a starch indicator, to [[titrate]] the iodine.\n\n: 2 S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub><sup>2\u2212</sup>(aq) + I<sub>2</sub> \u2192 S<sub>4</sub>O<sub>6</sub><sup>2\u2212</sup>(aq) + 2 I<sup>\u2212</sup>(aq)\n\n==Analysis==\n\nFrom the above [[stoichiometric]] equations, we can find that:\n\n:1 mole of O<sub>2</sub> \u2192 2 moles of MnO(OH)<sub>2</sub> \u2192 2 mole of I<sub>2</sub> \u2192 4 mole of  S<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub><sup>2\u2212</sup>\n\nTherefore, after determining the number of moles of iodine produced, we can work out the number of moles of oxygen molecules present in the original water sample. The oxygen content is usually presented in milligrams per liter (mg/L).\n\n==Limitations==\n\nThe success of this method is critically dependent upon the manner in which the sample is manipulated. At all stages, steps must be taken to ensure that oxygen is neither introduced to nor lost from the sample. Furthermore, the water sample must be free of any [[Solution|solutes]] that will [[oxidize]] or [[redox|reduce]] iodine.\n\nInstrumental methods for measurement of dissolved oxygen have widely supplanted the routine use of the Winkler test, although the test is still used to check instrument calibration.\n\n==BOD<sub>5</sub>==\n\nTo determine five-day [[biochemical oxygen demand]] (BOD<sub>5</sub>), several dilutions of a sample are analyzed for dissolved oxygen before and after a five-day incubation period at 20&nbsp;\u00b0C in the dark. In some cases, bacteria are used to provide a standardized community to uptake oxygen while consuming the organic matter in the sample; these bacteria are known as \"seed\". The difference in DO and the dilution factor are used to calculated BOD<sub>5</sub>. The resulting number (usually reported in parts per million or milligrams per liter) is useful in determining the relative organic strength of sewage or other polluted waters.\n\nThe BOD<sub>5</sub> test is an example of analysis that determines classes of materials in a sample.\n\n==Winkler bottle==\n\nA Winkler bottle is a piece of [[laboratory glassware]] specifically made for carrying out the Winkler test.  These bottles have conical tops and a close fitting stopper to aid in the exclusion of air bubbles when the top is sealed.  This is important because oxygen in trapped air would be included in the measurement and would affect the accuracy of the test.<ref>Whitney King, [http://web.colby.edu/colbyatsea/2011/02/11/winkler-titrations-measuring-dissolved-oxygen/ \"Winkler titrations \u2013 measuring dissolved oxygen\"], ''Colby at Sea'', 11 February 2011, retrieved and [https://www.webcitation.org/695OXDEfl archived] 11 July 2012.</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n{{Wikibooks|School Science|Winkler test for dissolved oxygen}}\n* Moran, Joseph M.; Morgan, Michael D., & Wiersma, James H.

Whatever the status and rights of the concubine, they were always inferior to those of the wife, and typically neither she nor her children had rights of inheritance. [[Courtesan|Especially]] among royalty and nobility, the woman in such relationships was commonly described as a [[Mistress (lover)|mistress]]. The children of such relationships were counted as [[illegitimate]] and in some societies were barred from inheriting the father's title or estates, even in the absence of legitimate heirs.\n\n==In Asia==\nConcubinage was highly popular before the early 20th century all over [[East Asia]]. The main function of concubinage was producing additional heirs, as well as bringing males pleasure. Children of concubines had lower rights in account to inheritance, which was regulated by the [[Dishu system]].\n\n=== Mongols ===\nPolygyny and concubinage were very common in Mongol society especially for powerful Mongol men.

The standard Chinese term translated as \"concubine\" was ''qi\u00e8'' {{lang|zh|\u59be}}, a term that has been used since ancient times, which means \"concubine; I, your servant (deprecating self reference)\". Concubinage resembled marriage in that concubines were recognized sexual partners of a man and were expected to bear children for him. Unofficial concubines ({{zh|t=\u5a62\u59be|p=b\u00ec qi\u00e8}}) were of lower status, and their children were considered illegitimate. The English term concubine is also used for what the Chinese refer to as ''p\u00ednf\u0113i'' ({{zh|t=\u5b2a\u5983}}), or \"consorts of emperors\", an official position often carrying a very high rank.<ref>Patricia Buckley Ebrey (2002): ''Women and the Family in Chinese History''.

From the [[Han dynasty#Eastern Han|Eastern Han]] period (AD 25\u2013220) onward, the number of concubines a man could have was limited by law.

It became permissible to promote a concubine to wife, if the original wife had died and the concubine was the mother of the only surviving sons. Moreover, the prohibition against forcing a widow to remarry was extended to widowed concubines. During this period tablets for concubine-mothers seem to have been more commonly placed in family ancestral altars, and genealogies of some lineages listed concubine-mothers.<ref name=\"Ebrey 2002: 60\"/>\n\nImperial concubines, kept by emperors in the [[Forbidden City]], had [[ranks of imperial consorts in China|different ranks]] and were traditionally guarded by [[eunuch]]s to ensure that they could not be impregnated by anyone but the emperor.<ref name=\"Concubines of Ancient China\"/> In [[Ming dynasty|Ming China]] (1368\u20131644) there was an official system to select concubines for the emperor.

If the concubine was a commoner, a messenger was sent with betrothal money or a note for exemption of tax to ask for her parents' acceptance. Even though the woman would not be a legal wife, a situation normally considered a demotion, many wealthy merchants believed that being the concubine of a samurai was superior to being the legal wife of a commoner. When a merchant's daughter married a samurai, her family's money erased the samurai's debts, and the samurai's social status improved the standing of the merchant family. If a samurai's commoner concubine gave birth to a son, the son could inherit his father's social status.\n\nConcubines sometimes wielded significant influence. [[Nene (aristocrat)|Nene]], wife of Toyotomi Hideyoshi, was known to overrule her husband's decisions at times and [[Yodo-dono]], his concubine, became the ''de facto'' master of Osaka castle and the Toyotomi clan after Hideyoshi's death.\n\n===Korea===\n[[Joseon]] monarchs had a harem which contained concubines of different ranks. [[Empress Myeongseong]] managed to have sons, preventing sons of concubines getting power.\n\nChildren of concubines often had lower value in account of marriage. A daughter of concubine could not marry a wife-born son of the same class. For example, [[Jang Nok-su]] was a concubine-born daughter of a mayor, who was initially married to a slave-servant, and later became a high-ranking concubine of [[Yeonsangun]].\n\n== Vikings ==\n[[Polygyny]] was common among [[Vikings]], rich and powerful Viking men tended to have many wives and concubines. Viking men would often buy or [[Bride kidnapping|capture women]] and make them into their wives or concubines.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Karras|first=Ruth Mazo|date=1990|title=Concubinage and Slavery in the Viking Age|journal=Scandinavian Studies|volume=62|issue=2|pages=141\u2013162|issn=0036-5637|jstor=40919117}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Poser|first=Charles M.|date=1994|title=The dissemination of multiple sclerosis: A Viking saga?

A man could have many wives and concubines. Legally, any children born to a concubine were considered to be the children of the wife she was under. [[Sarah]] had to get [[Ishmael]] out of her house because legally Ishmael would always be the first born son even though [[Isaac]] was her natural child.\nThe concubine may not have commanded the exact amount of respect as the wife. In the [[Levitical]] rules on sexual relations, the Hebrew word that is commonly translated as \"wife\" is distinct from the Hebrew word that means \"concubine\". However, on at least one other occasion the term is used to refer to a woman who is not a wife{{snd}} specifically, the handmaiden of Jacob's wife.<ref>{{bibleverse||Genesis|30:4|}}</ref> In the Levitical code, sexual intercourse between a man and a wife of a different man was forbidden and punishable by death for both persons involved.<ref>{{bibleverse||Leviticus|20:10|}}</ref><ref>{{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|22:22|}}</ref> Since it was regarded as the highest blessing to have many children, wives often gave their maids to their husbands if they were barren, as in the cases of [[Sarah]] and [[Hagar (Bible)|Hagar]], and [[Rachel]] and [[Bilhah]]. The children of the concubine often had equal rights with those of the wife;<ref name=\"JewEncPil\" /> for example, King [[Abimelech (Judges)|Abimelech]] was the son of [[Gideon]] and his concubine.<ref>{{bibleverse||Judges|8:31|}}</ref> Later biblical figures such as Gideon, and [[Solomon]] had concubines in addition to many childbearing wives. For example, the [[Books of Kings]] say that Solomon had 700 wives and 300 concubines.<ref>{{bibleverse|1|Kings|11:1\u20133}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Fiddlerandtaborer.png|thumb|Illustration from the [[Morgan Bible]] of the [[Benjamite]]s taking women of [[Shiloh (biblical city)|Shiloh]] as concubines.]]\nThe account of the unnamed Levite in Judges 19\u201320<ref>{{bibleverse||Judges|19|NRVS}}, {{bibleverse||Judges|20|NRSV}}</ref> shows that the taking of concubines was not the exclusive preserve of kings or patriarchs in Israel during the time of the Judges, and that the rape of a concubine was completely unacceptable to the Israelite nation and led to a [[civil war]]. In the story, the Levite appears to be an ordinary member of the tribe, whose concubine was a woman from Bethlehem in Judah. This woman was unfaithful, and eventually abandoned him to return to her paternal household. However, after four months, the Levite, referred to as her husband, decided to travel to her father's house to persuade his concubine to return. She is amenable to returning with him, and the father-in-law is very welcoming. The father-in-law convinces the Levite to remain several additional days, until the party leaves behind schedule in the late evening. The group pass up a nearby non-Israelite town to arrive very late in the city of Gibeah, which is in the land of the Benjaminites. The group sit around the town square, waiting for a local to invite them in for the evening, as was the custom for travelers. A local old man invites them to stay in his home, offering them [[guest right]] by washing their feet and offering them food. A band of wicked townsmen attack the house and demand the host send out the Levite man so they can have sex with him. The host offers to send out his virgin daughter as well as the Levite's concubine for them to rape, to avoid breaking guest right towards the Levite. Eventually, to ensure his own safety and that of his host, the Levite gives the men his concubine, who is raped and abused through the night, until she is left collapsed against the front door at dawn. In the morning, the Levite finds her when he tries to leave. When she fails to respond to her husband's order to get up, most likely because she is dead, the Levite places her on his donkey and continues home. Once home, he dismembers her body and distributes the 12 parts throughout the nation of Israel. The Israelites gather to learn why they were sent such grisly gifts, and are told of the sadistic rape of his concubine by the Levite. The crime is considered outrageous by the Israelite tribesmen, who then wreak total retribution on the men of Gibeah, as well as the surrounding tribe of Benjamin when they support the Gibeans, killing them without mercy and burning all their towns. The inhabitants of (the town of) Jabesh Gilead are then slaughtered as a punishment for not joining the eleven tribes in their war against the Benjaminites, and their four hundred unmarried daughters given in [[forced marriage]] to the six hundred Benjamite survivors. Finally, the two hundred Benjaminite survivors who still have no wives are granted a [[raptio|mass marriage by abduction]] by the other tribes.\n\n====In modern Judaism====\nIn Judaism, concubines are referred to by the Hebrew term [[pilegesh]] ({{lang-he|\u05e4\u05d9\u05dc\u05d2\u05e9}}).

Indeed, such thinkers argued that commoners may not engage in any type of [[human sexuality|sexual relations]] outside of a marriage.\n\nMaimonides was not the first Jewish thinker to criticise concubinage. For example, [[Leviticus Rabbah]] severely condemns the custom.<ref>''Leviticus Rabbah'', 25</ref> Other Jewish thinkers, such as [[Nahmanides]], [[Samuel ben Uri Shraga Phoebus]], and [[Jacob Emden]], strongly objected to the idea that concubines should be forbidden.\n\nIn the [[Modern Hebrew|Hebrew]] of the contemporary [[Israel|State of Israel]], ''pilegesh'' is often used as the equivalent of the English word \"[[Mistress (lover)|mistress]]\"\u2014i.e., the female partner in extramarital relations\u2014regardless of legal recognition. Attempts have been initiated to popularise ''pilegesh'' as a form of premarital, non-marital or extramarital relationship (which, according to the perspective of the enacting person(s), is permitted by [[Halakha|Jewish law]]).<ref>{{cite news |title=Kosher sex without marriage |url=http://www.jpost.com/Jewish-World/Jewish-Features/Kosher-sex-without-marriage |newspaper=The Jerusalem Post |date=16 March 2006 |author=Matthew Wagner |accessdate=13 June 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140503230106/http://www.jpost.com/Jewish-World/Jewish-Features/Kosher-sex-without-marriage |archive-date=3 May 2014 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>Adam Dickter, \"ISO: Kosher Concubine\", ''New York Jewish Week'', December 2006</ref><ref>[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-4826676.html Suzanne Glass, \"The Concubine Connection\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.li/20130103033314/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-4826676.html |date=3 January 2013 }}, ''The Independent'', London 20 October 1996</ref>\n\n===In Islam and Arab world===\n{{main|Ma malakat aymanukum}}\n{{See also|Sexual slavery in Islam}}\n{{POV section|date=August 2014}}\n[[File:V.M.

Since the Qur'an applies the term \"believers\" to men and women alike, and since the term azwaj (\"spouses\"), too, denotes both the male and the female partners in marriage, there is no reason for attributing to the phrase aw ma malakat aymanuhum the meaning of \"their female slaves\"; and since, on the other hand, it is out of the question that female and male slaves could have been referred to here, it is obvious that this phrase does not relate to slaves at all, but has the same meaning as in\u00a04:24- namely, \"those whom they rightfully possess through wedlock\" (see note [26] on\u00a04:24) - with the significant difference that in the present context this expression relates to both husbands and wives, who \"rightfully possess\" one another by virtue of marriage. On the basis of this interpretation, the particle aw which precedes this clause does not denote an alternative (\"or\") but is, rather, in the nature of an explanatory amplification, more or less analgous to the phrase \"in other words\" or \"that is\", thus giving to the whole sentence the meaning, \"...save with their spouses - that is, those whom they rightfully possess [through wedlock]...\", etc. (Cf. a similar construction 25:62 - \"for him who has the will to take thought - that is [lit., \"or\"], has the will to be grateful\".)\u201c}}</ref> which was not considered prostitution, and was very common during the [[Arab slave trade]] throughout the Middle Ages and [[early modern period]], when women and girls from the [[Caucasus]], [[Africa]], [[Central Asia]] and [[Europe]] were captured and served as [[concubine]]s in the [[harem]]s of the [[Arab World]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/history/slavery_7.shtml|title=BBC \u2013 Religions \u2013 Islam: Slavery in Islam|accessdate=11 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090521234122/http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/history/slavery_7.shtml|archive-date=21 May 2009|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> [[Ibn Battuta]] tells us several times that he was given or purchased female slaves.<ref>[http://www.sfusd.k12.ca.us/schwww/sch618/Ibn_Battuta/Slavery.html Insights into the concept of Slavery] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091122171200/http://www.sfusd.k12.ca.us/schwww/sch618/ibn_battuta/Slavery.html |date=2009-11-22 }}.

Whatever the status and rights of the concubine, they were always inferior to those of the wife, and typically neither she nor her children had rights of inheritance. [[Courtesan|Especially]] among royalty and nobility, the woman in such relationships was commonly described as a [[Mistress (lover)|mistress]]. The children of such relationships were counted as [[illegitimate]] and in some societies were barred from inheriting the father's title or estates, even in the absence of legitimate heirs.\n\n==In Asia==\nConcubinage was highly popular before the early 20th century all over [[East Asia]]. The main function of concubinage was producing additional heirs, as well as bringing males pleasure. Children of concubines had lower rights in account to inheritance, which was regulated by the [[Dishu system]].\n\n=== Mongols ===\nPolygyny and concubinage were very common in Mongol society especially for powerful Mongol men. [[Genghis Khan]], [[\u00d6gedei Khan]], [[Jochi]], [[Tolui]], and [[Kublai Khan]] (among others) all had many wives and concubines.\n\nGenghis Khan frequently acquired wives and concubines from empires and societies that he had conquered, these women were often princesses or queens that were [[Bride kidnapping|taken captive]] or gifted to him.<ref name=\":02\">{{Cite book|last=Broadbridge|first=Anne F.|url=https://books.google.com/?id=RHOFDwAAQBAJ&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=Women and the Making of the Mongol Empire|date=2018-07-18|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-108-63662-9|location=|pages=74, 92|language=en}}</ref> Genghis Khan's most famous concubine was [[M\u00f6ge Khatun]], according to the Persian historian [[Ata-Malik Juvayni]] she was \"given to Chinggis Khan by a chief of the [[Bakran tribe|Bakrin tribe]], and he loved her very much.\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=McClynn|first1=Frank|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RBZpCQAAQBAJ&pg=PT117|title=Genghis Khan: His Conquests, His Empire, His Legacy|date=14 July 2015|publisher=Hachette Books|isbn=978-0306823961|page=117}}</ref> After Genghis Khan died, M\u00f6ge Khatun became a wife of \u00d6gedei Khan. \u00d6gedei also favored her as a wife, and she frequently accompanied him on his [[Hunting|hunting expeditions]].<ref name=\"denicola\">{{cite book|last1=De Nicola|first1=Bruno|title=Women in Mongol Iran: The Khatuns, 1206-1335|date=2017|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|page=68}}</ref>\n\n===China===\n{{See also|Women in ancient and imperial China}}\n[[File:Hua-Qing-Chi-Yang-Gui-Fei.jpg|alt=|thumb|289x289px|Statue of [[Yang Guifei]] (719-756), the favoured concubine of Emperor [[Tang Xuanzong]] of [[China]].]]\n[[File:The Fourth Concubine of Hexing.jpg|thumb|upright|Portrait of a concubine, by Chinese painter [[Lam Qua]], 1864]]\nIn China, successful men often had concubines until the practice was outlawed when the [[Communist Party of China]] came to power in 1949. The standard Chinese term translated as \"concubine\" was ''qi\u00e8'' {{lang|zh|\u59be}}, a term that has been used since ancient times, which means \"concubine; I, your servant (deprecating self reference)\". Concubinage resembled marriage in that concubines were recognized sexual partners of a man and were expected to bear children for him. Unofficial concubines ({{zh|t=\u5a62\u59be|p=b\u00ec qi\u00e8}}) were of lower status, and their children were considered illegitimate. The English term concubine is also used for what the Chinese refer to as ''p\u00ednf\u0113i'' ({{zh|t=\u5b2a\u5983}}), or \"consorts of emperors\", an official position often carrying a very high rank.<ref>Patricia Buckley Ebrey (2002): ''Women and the Family in Chinese History''.

From the [[Han dynasty#Eastern Han|Eastern Han]] period (AD 25\u2013220) onward, the number of concubines a man could have was limited by law. The higher rank and the more noble identity a man possessed, the more concubines he was permitted to have.<ref>Shi Fengyi \u53f2\u51e4\u4eea (1987): Zhongguo gudai hunyin yu jiating \u4e2d\u56fd\u53e4\u4ee3\u5a5a\u59fb\u4e0e\u5bb6\u5ead ''Marriage and Family in Ancient China''.

In the ''[[Book of Rites]]'' chapter on \"The Pattern of the Family\" ({{zh|t=\u5167\u5247}}) it says, \u201cIf there were betrothal rites, she became a wife; and if she went without these, a concubine.\u201d<ref>{{cite book|url=http://ctext.org/liji/nei-ze#n9964|title=Nei Ze|accessdate=11 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304051012/http://ctext.org/liji/nei-ze#n9964|archive-date=4 March 2016|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Wives brought a [[dowry]] to a relationship, but concubines did not.

Although a concubine could produce heirs, her children would be inferior in social status to a wife's children, although they were of higher status than illegitimate children.

It became permissible to promote a concubine to wife, if the original wife had died and the concubine was the mother of the only surviving sons. Moreover, the prohibition against forcing a widow to remarry was extended to widowed concubines. During this period tablets for concubine-mothers seem to have been more commonly placed in family ancestral altars, and genealogies of some lineages listed concubine-mothers.<ref name=\"Ebrey 2002: 60\"/>\n\nImperial concubines, kept by emperors in the [[Forbidden City]], had [[ranks of imperial consorts in China|different ranks]] and were traditionally guarded by [[eunuch]]s to ensure that they could not be impregnated by anyone but the emperor.<ref name=\"Concubines of Ancient China\"/> In [[Ming dynasty|Ming China]] (1368\u20131644) there was an official system to select concubines for the emperor. The age of the candidates ranged mainly from 14 to 16. Virtues, behavior, character, appearance and body condition were the selection criteria.<ref>Qiu Zhonglin(Chung-lin Ch'iu)\u90b1\u4ef2\u9e9f:\"Mingdai linxuan Houfei jiqi guizhi\" \u660e\u4ee3\u9074\u9078\u5f8c\u5983\u53ca\u5176\u898f\u5236 (The Imperial Concubine Selection System during the Ming Dynasty).

Lady Yehenara, otherwise known as [[Empress Dowager Cixi]], was arguably one of the most successful concubines in Chinese history. Cixi first entered the court as a concubine to [[Xianfeng Emperor]] and gave birth to his only surviving son, who later became [[Tongzhi Emperor]].

In many cases, taking a concubine was akin to a marriage. Kidnapping a concubine, although common in fiction, would have been shameful, if not criminal. If the concubine was a commoner, a messenger was sent with betrothal money or a note for exemption of tax to ask for her parents' acceptance. Even though the woman would not be a legal wife, a situation normally considered a demotion, many wealthy merchants believed that being the concubine of a samurai was superior to being the legal wife of a commoner. When a merchant's daughter married a samurai, her family's money erased the samurai's debts, and the samurai's social status improved the standing of the merchant family. If a samurai's commoner concubine gave birth to a son, the son could inherit his father's social status.\n\nConcubines sometimes wielded significant influence. [[Nene (aristocrat)|Nene]], wife of Toyotomi Hideyoshi, was known to overrule her husband's decisions at times and [[Yodo-dono]], his concubine, became the ''de facto'' master of Osaka castle and the Toyotomi clan after Hideyoshi's death.\n\n===Korea===\n[[Joseon]] monarchs had a harem which contained concubines of different ranks. [[Empress Myeongseong]] managed to have sons, preventing sons of concubines getting power.\n\nChildren of concubines often had lower value in account of marriage. A daughter of concubine could not marry a wife-born son of the same class. For example, [[Jang Nok-su]] was a concubine-born daughter of a mayor, who was initially married to a slave-servant, and later became a high-ranking concubine of [[Yeonsangun]].\n\n== Vikings ==\n[[Polygyny]] was common among [[Vikings]], rich and powerful Viking men tended to have many wives and concubines. Viking men would often buy or [[Bride kidnapping|capture women]] and make them into their wives or concubines.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Karras|first=Ruth Mazo|date=1990|title=Concubinage and Slavery in the Viking Age|journal=Scandinavian Studies|volume=62|issue=2|pages=141\u2013162|issn=0036-5637|jstor=40919117}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Poser|first=Charles M.|date=1994|title=The dissemination of multiple sclerosis: A Viking saga?

A man could have many wives and concubines. Legally, any children born to a concubine were considered to be the children of the wife she was under. [[Sarah]] had to get [[Ishmael]] out of her house because legally Ishmael would always be the first born son even though [[Isaac]] was her natural child.\nThe concubine may not have commanded the exact amount of respect as the wife. In the [[Levitical]] rules on sexual relations, the Hebrew word that is commonly translated as \"wife\" is distinct from the Hebrew word that means \"concubine\". However, on at least one other occasion the term is used to refer to a woman who is not a wife{{snd}} specifically, the handmaiden of Jacob's wife.<ref>{{bibleverse||Genesis|30:4|}}</ref> In the Levitical code, sexual intercourse between a man and a wife of a different man was forbidden and punishable by death for both persons involved.<ref>{{bibleverse||Leviticus|20:10|}}</ref><ref>{{bibleverse||Deuteronomy|22:22|}}</ref> Since it was regarded as the highest blessing to have many children, wives often gave their maids to their husbands if they were barren, as in the cases of [[Sarah]] and [[Hagar (Bible)|Hagar]], and [[Rachel]] and [[Bilhah]]. The children of the concubine often had equal rights with those of the wife;<ref name=\"JewEncPil\" /> for example, King [[Abimelech (Judges)|Abimelech]] was the son of [[Gideon]] and his concubine.<ref>{{bibleverse||Judges|8:31|}}</ref> Later biblical figures such as Gideon, and [[Solomon]] had concubines in addition to many childbearing wives. For example, the [[Books of Kings]] say that Solomon had 700 wives and 300 concubines.<ref>{{bibleverse|1|Kings|11:1\u20133}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Fiddlerandtaborer.png|thumb|Illustration from the [[Morgan Bible]] of the [[Benjamite]]s taking women of [[Shiloh (biblical city)|Shiloh]] as concubines.]]\nThe account of the unnamed Levite in Judges 19\u201320<ref>{{bibleverse||Judges|19|NRVS}}, {{bibleverse||Judges|20|NRSV}}</ref> shows that the taking of concubines was not the exclusive preserve of kings or patriarchs in Israel during the time of the Judges, and that the rape of a concubine was completely unacceptable to the Israelite nation and led to a [[civil war]]. In the story, the Levite appears to be an ordinary member of the tribe, whose concubine was a woman from Bethlehem in Judah. This woman was unfaithful, and eventually abandoned him to return to her paternal household. However, after four months, the Levite, referred to as her husband, decided to travel to her father's house to persuade his concubine to return. She is amenable to returning with him, and the father-in-law is very welcoming. The father-in-law convinces the Levite to remain several additional days, until the party leaves behind schedule in the late evening. The group pass up a nearby non-Israelite town to arrive very late in the city of Gibeah, which is in the land of the Benjaminites. The group sit around the town square, waiting for a local to invite them in for the evening, as was the custom for travelers. A local old man invites them to stay in his home, offering them [[guest right]] by washing their feet and offering them food. A band of wicked townsmen attack the house and demand the host send out the Levite man so they can have sex with him. The host offers to send out his virgin daughter as well as the Levite's concubine for them to rape, to avoid breaking guest right towards the Levite. Eventually, to ensure his own safety and that of his host, the Levite gives the men his concubine, who is raped and abused through the night, until she is left collapsed against the front door at dawn. In the morning, the Levite finds her when he tries to leave. When she fails to respond to her husband's order to get up, most likely because she is dead, the Levite places her on his donkey and continues home. Once home, he dismembers her body and distributes the 12 parts throughout the nation of Israel. The Israelites gather to learn why they were sent such grisly gifts, and are told of the sadistic rape of his concubine by the Levite. The crime is considered outrageous by the Israelite tribesmen, who then wreak total retribution on the men of Gibeah, as well as the surrounding tribe of Benjamin when they support the Gibeans, killing them without mercy and burning all their towns. The inhabitants of (the town of) Jabesh Gilead are then slaughtered as a punishment for not joining the eleven tribes in their war against the Benjaminites, and their four hundred unmarried daughters given in [[forced marriage]] to the six hundred Benjamite survivors. Finally, the two hundred Benjaminite survivors who still have no wives are granted a [[raptio|mass marriage by abduction]] by the other tribes.\n\n====In modern Judaism====\nIn Judaism, concubines are referred to by the Hebrew term [[pilegesh]] ({{lang-he|\u05e4\u05d9\u05dc\u05d2\u05e9}}). The term is a loanword from [[Ancient Greek]] {{lang|grc|\u03c0\u03b1\u03bb\u03bb\u03b1\u03ba\u03af\u03c2}},<ref>Michael Lieb, Milton and the culture of violence, p.274, Cornell University Press, 1994</ref><ref>Agendas for the study of Midrash in the twenty-first century, Marc Lee Raphael, p.136, Dept. of Religion, College of William and Mary, 1999</ref><ref>Nicholas Clapp, Sheba: Through the Desert in Search of the Legendary Queen, p.297, Houghton Mifflin, 2002</ref> meaning \"a mistress staying in house\".\n\nAccording to the [[Talmud|Babylonian Talmud]],<ref name=\"JewEncPil\" /> the difference between a concubine and a legitimate wife was that the latter received a [[ketubah]] and [[Jewish wedding|her marriage]] (''nissu'in'') was preceded by an [[erusin]] (\"formal betrothal\"), which was not the case for a concubine.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/12148-pilegesh|title=PILEGESH (Hebrew, ; comp.

Indeed, such thinkers argued that commoners may not engage in any type of [[human sexuality|sexual relations]] outside of a marriage.\n\nMaimonides was not the first Jewish thinker to criticise concubinage. For example, [[Leviticus Rabbah]] severely condemns the custom.<ref>''Leviticus Rabbah'', 25</ref> Other Jewish thinkers, such as [[Nahmanides]], [[Samuel ben Uri Shraga Phoebus]], and [[Jacob Emden]], strongly objected to the idea that concubines should be forbidden.\n\nIn the [[Modern Hebrew|Hebrew]] of the contemporary [[Israel|State of Israel]], ''pilegesh'' is often used as the equivalent of the English word \"[[Mistress (lover)|mistress]]\"\u2014i.e., the female partner in extramarital relations\u2014regardless of legal recognition. Attempts have been initiated to popularise ''pilegesh'' as a form of premarital, non-marital or extramarital relationship (which, according to the perspective of the enacting person(s), is permitted by [[Halakha|Jewish law]]).<ref>{{cite news |title=Kosher sex without marriage |url=http://www.jpost.com/Jewish-World/Jewish-Features/Kosher-sex-without-marriage |newspaper=The Jerusalem Post |date=16 March 2006 |author=Matthew Wagner |accessdate=13 June 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140503230106/http://www.jpost.com/Jewish-World/Jewish-Features/Kosher-sex-without-marriage |archive-date=3 May 2014 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>Adam Dickter, \"ISO: Kosher Concubine\", ''New York Jewish Week'', December 2006</ref><ref>[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-4826676.html Suzanne Glass, \"The Concubine Connection\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.li/20130103033314/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-4826676.html |date=3 January 2013 }}, ''The Independent'', London 20 October 1996</ref>\n\n===In Islam and Arab world===\n{{main|Ma malakat aymanukum}}\n{{See also|Sexual slavery in Islam}}\n{{POV section|date=August 2014}}\n[[File:V.M.

Most of the commentators assume unquestioningly that this relates to female slaves, and that the particle aw (\"or\") denotes a permissible alternative. This conventional interpretation is, in my opinion inadmissible inasmuch as it is based on the assumption that sexual intercourse with one's female slave is permitted without marriage: an assumption which is contradicted by the Qur'an itself (see\u00a04:3, {24}, {25} and\u00a024:32, with the corresponding notes). Nor is this the only objection to the above-mentioned interpretation. Since the Qur'an applies the term \"believers\" to men and women alike, and since the term azwaj (\"spouses\"), too, denotes both the male and the female partners in marriage, there is no reason for attributing to the phrase aw ma malakat aymanuhum the meaning of \"their female slaves\"; and since, on the other hand, it is out of the question that female and male slaves could have been referred to here, it is obvious that this phrase does not relate to slaves at all, but has the same meaning as in\u00a04:24- namely, \"those whom they rightfully possess through wedlock\" (see note [26] on\u00a04:24) - with the significant difference that in the present context this expression relates to both husbands and wives, who \"rightfully possess\" one another by virtue of marriage. On the basis of this interpretation, the particle aw which precedes this clause does not denote an alternative (\"or\") but is, rather, in the nature of an explanatory amplification, more or less analgous to the phrase \"in other words\" or \"that is\", thus giving to the whole sentence the meaning, \"...save with their spouses - that is, those whom they rightfully possess [through wedlock]...\", etc. (Cf. a similar construction 25:62 - \"for him who has the will to take thought - that is [lit., \"or\"], has the will to be grateful\".)\u201c}}</ref> which was not considered prostitution, and was very common during the [[Arab slave trade]] throughout the Middle Ages and [[early modern period]], when women and girls from the [[Caucasus]], [[Africa]], [[Central Asia]] and [[Europe]] were captured and served as [[concubine]]s in the [[harem]]s of the [[Arab World]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/history/slavery_7.shtml|title=BBC \u2013 Religions \u2013 Islam: Slavery in Islam|accessdate=11 December 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090521234122/http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/history/slavery_7.shtml|archive-date=21 May 2009|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> [[Ibn Battuta]] tells us several times that he was given or purchased female slaves.<ref>[http://www.sfusd.k12.ca.us/schwww/sch618/Ibn_Battuta/Slavery.html Insights into the concept of Slavery] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091122171200/http://www.sfusd.k12.ca.us/schwww/sch618/ibn_battuta/Slavery.html |date=2009-11-22 }}.
