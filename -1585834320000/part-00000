Once the slideshow is over, a victorious and smiling Shakira runs on stage waving at fans (with a firework rain at the back of the stadiums for the Latin American dates), opening the setlist with an [[Electronic dance music|EDM]] medley of her 1995 breakthrough hits \"[[Estoy Aqu\u00ed]]\" and \"[[\u00bfD\u00f3nde Est\u00e1s Coraz\u00f3n?]].\" She plays a synth keyboard in between the songs and a confetti shower explodes once the second song of medley is played. The costumes of this act are designed by [[Balmain (fashion house)|Balmain]], [[Brian Lichtenberg]], and Black Majesty. After the \"memorabilia medley,\" an intermission comes: Shakira is seen sitting on a rock chair with chains around her; the entertainer starts dancing, chest pumping and hair whipping, to finally succeed in breaking the chains, and her 2009 hit \"[[She Wolf (Shakira song)|She Wolf]]\" begins. After its second chorus, she plays again the synth keyboard and walks through the catwalk right to the B-stage, asking to the women in the crowd to howl \u00e0 la \"She-wolf style.\" The concert continues with a rockified version of her 2000 hit \"Si Te Vas\" (a traditional feature for most of her stage tours), what is followed by two recent ''[[El Dorado (Shakira album)|El Dorado]]'' singles: \"[[Nada (Shakira song)|Nada]]\" and \"[[Perro Fiel]];\" the latter as a [[Mashup (music)|mash-up]] with another [[Nicky Jam]]'s single, \"[[El Perd\u00f3n]].\" The two artists (him on background) sing both songs of mash-up, and pyrotechnique effects appear throughout this number. In sequence, she introduces her band, and they play a [[Rhythm and Blues|R&B]] version of her English-speaking 2002 tune \"[[Underneath Your Clothes]].\" A slightly edited version of \"[[Me Enamor\u00e9 (Shakira song)|Me Enamor\u00e9]]\" comes after. Then, the Latin songwriter takes an electric guitar to play her 1998 rock hit \"[[Inevitable (song)|Inevitable]].\" The act ends with 2016 megahit \"[[Chantaje]],\" where [[Maluma (singer)|Maluma]] appears for a moment in the central screen.\n\nWith the first costume change, an \"Interlude of the Gods\" is presented, recreating in [[animated cartoon|animation]] the story of the creation of universe according to the [[Pre-Columbian era|Pre-Columbian]] Andean traditions (specifically from the mythology of the [[Muisca]] civilization, who populated part of what is nowadays Colombian territory - this is the same people from whom arose the [[El Dorado]] legend), being narrated by an indigenous child, as excerpts of her 2008 single \"[[Despedida (Shakira song)|Despedida]]\" are heard. The little child finishes its tale with the story of the birth of the Mother Goddess, [[Bachu\u00e9]], who was in charge to populate the Earth. Shakira, as in a Bachu\u00e9 embodiment, returns to stage wearing a golden belly dancing attire with her back to the crowd and a mask on the back of her head; all costume pieces are designed by Laurel Dewitt. Right after this dance personification, she executes her signature belly dancing and sings the Sahara Mix of her 2001 smash hit \"[[Whenever, Wherever]]\" (that previously served as the encore act for her [[Tour of the Mongoose]]); in the halfway, one more belly dance break is done, this in a very similar way of the one happened during \"[[Ojos As\u00ed]]\" at her [[The Sun Comes Out World Tour|immediately previous tour]].\n\nSeconding this one-song act, an \"Underwater interlude\" is shown as a backdrop consisting of outtake scenes of Shakira's underwater videos shot for \"[[Trap (Shakira song)|Trap]]\" music clip, along with her disserting about the meaning of life. The third act comes out when Cuban percussionist Albert Men\u00e9ndez, a longtime contributor of her band, plays a piano, and Shakira is spotted at a corner of stage singing her 1998 ballad \"[[T\u00fa (song)|T\u00fa]]\" (in its most known ''[[MTV Unplugged (Shakira album)|MTV Unplugged]]'' live incarnation, but missing second verse and chorus), whilst dressed up with black outfits designed by fashion houses [[Agent Provocateur]] and Koral, alongside with chain bracelets by Elena Staun and a long avantgarde jacket by Israeli fashionist Liona Taragan. Following this up, \"[[Amarillo (Shakira song)|Amarillo]]\" comes, with her playing a drawing-decorated acoustic guitar, which is raised at the end of song, revealing a picture of her partner, the Spanish football player [[Gerard Piqu\u00e9]], along with their 2 sons, Milan and Sasha. She takes off the Taragan jacket soon as her smash hit duet with [[Alejandro Sanz]], \"[[La Tortura]],\" starts. Both Sanz (in-off) and Men\u00e9ndez do the male lyrics. Soon, Shakira brings most part of her band to the B-stage to join her to perform altogether an early tune of hers, \"[[Antolog\u00eda (song)|Antolog\u00eda]],\" in a reminder of the same song rendition at selected dates of the [[Oral Fixation Tour]]. When it is over, the band returns to their original places, while she has a short talk to her drummer Brendan Buckley, that leads to 2014 hit \"[[Can't Remember to Forget You]],\" in a new [[reggae music|reggae]] arrangement. Towards its final, the song turns into a heavier rock version as Shakira plays frenzily the drums, in company of [[Rihanna]] singing part of chorus on the sidescreens. This section ends thereafter with a [[merengue music|merengue]] medley of two ''[[Sale El Sol]]'' hits, \"[[Loca (Shakira song)|Loca]]\" and \"[[Rabiosa (song)|Rabiosa]].\"\n\nAs Shakira leaves the stage, an instrumental-only violin version interlude of her 2016 comeback hit, \"[[La Bicicleta]],\" is played by band member Caitlin Evanson, while the other musicians play characteristic samples of [[Queen (band)|Queen]]'s worldwide  hit \"[[We Will Rock You]].\" Four big drums are put in the front of main stage (one for each musicist but the bassist), and Shakira goes back, wearing a red and yellow (signing colors shared by the flags of [[Colombia]] and [[Spain]], besides [[Catalonia]]) ostrich skirt, designed by Hawaiian clothing line Iheartpolynesia, to dance and sing a medley of her [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] hits \"[[Dare (La La La)|La La La (Brazil 2014)]]\" (2014) and \"[[Waka Waka (This Time for Africa)|Waka Waka]]\" (2010).\n\nFor the encore, there is an \"Education Interlude:\" a [[short movie]] to raise awareness for children who are deprived of any kind of education, portraiting the daily fight of kids around the world in the most underprivileged areas putting maximum efforts to receive education. As it ends, Shakira arrives to a small round stage located in the middle of the crowd in a gold dress and sings a shortened version of \"Toneladas\" (being this song removed on both Istanbul and Bsharri nights - same happened to \"Antolog\u00eda\"); after that, she removes her golden dress to reveal a pink Colombian dress (being both outfits designed by [[Barranquilla]]-born stylist Juan Carlos Obando), and runs through the crowd greeting and  hugging her fans, returning to the main stage to perform her 2006 [[Billboard Hot 100]] chart topper \"[[Hips Don't Lie]];\" closing the concert, she tells the audience about her hometown roots and does an [[a cappella]] snippet of \"La Bicicleta,\" which is succeeded by a full length, full band accompanied version of the duet with fellow Colombian [[Carlos Vives]], who has also his presence on the circular screens. As Shakira says goodbye to the audience, colorful confetti showers explode as an extra thanks to fans (firework shows were added for this part during the Latin American concerts too).\n\n==Critical reception==\n\n===Europe & Asia=== \n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Shakira in Estadio Azteca.png|thumb|right|Shakira performing on stage in [[Estadio Azteca]], [[Mexico City, Mexico]], where she sold out 2 nights in the stadium, becoming the third artist in history only after [[Gloria Estefan]] and [[Michael Jackson]]]] -->\nThe tour received general to universal acclaim.

Once the slideshow is over, a victorious and smiling Shakira runs on stage waving at fans (with a firework rain at the back of the stadiums for the Latin American dates), opening the setlist with an [[Electronic dance music|EDM]] medley of her 1995 breakthrough hits \"[[Estoy Aqu\u00ed]]\" and \"[[\u00bfD\u00f3nde Est\u00e1s Coraz\u00f3n?]].\" She plays a synth keyboard in between the songs and a confetti shower explodes once the second song of medley is played. The costumes of this act are designed by [[Balmain (fashion house)|Balmain]], [[Brian Lichtenberg]], and Black Majesty. After the \"memorabilia medley,\" an intermission comes: Shakira is seen sitting on a rock chair with chains around her; the entertainer starts dancing, chest pumping and hair whipping, to finally succeed in breaking the chains, and her 2009 hit \"[[She Wolf (Shakira song)|She Wolf]]\" begins. After its second chorus, she plays again the synth keyboard and walks through the catwalk right to the B-stage, asking to the women in the crowd to howl \u00e0 la \"She-wolf style.\" The concert continues with a rockified version of her 2000 hit \"Si Te Vas\" (a traditional feature for most of her stage tours), what is followed by two recent ''[[El Dorado (Shakira album)|El Dorado]]'' singles: \"[[Nada (Shakira song)|Nada]]\" and \"[[Perro Fiel]];\" the latter as a [[Mashup (music)|mash-up]] with another [[Nicky Jam]]'s single, \"[[El Perd\u00f3n]].\" The two artists (him on background) sing both songs of mash-up, and pyrotechnique effects appear throughout this number. In sequence, she introduces her band, and they play a [[Rhythm and Blues|R&B]] version of her English-speaking 2002 tune \"[[Underneath Your Clothes]].\" A slightly edited version of \"[[Me Enamor\u00e9 (Shakira song)|Me Enamor\u00e9]]\" comes after. Then, the Latin songwriter takes an electric guitar to play her 1998 rock hit \"[[Inevitable (song)|Inevitable]].\" The act ends with 2016 megahit \"[[Chantaje]],\" where [[Maluma (singer)|Maluma]] appears for a moment in the central screen.\n\nWith the first costume change, an \"Interlude of the Gods\" is presented, recreating in [[animated cartoon|animation]] the story of the creation of universe according to the [[Pre-Columbian era|Pre-Columbian]] Andean traditions (specifically from the mythology of the [[Muisca]] civilization, who populated part of what is nowadays Colombian territory - this is the same people from whom arose the [[El Dorado]] legend), being narrated by an indigenous child, as excerpts of her 2008 single \"[[Despedida (Shakira song)|Despedida]]\" are heard. The little child finishes its tale with the story of the birth of the Mother Goddess, [[Bachu\u00e9]], who was in charge to populate the Earth. Shakira, as in a Bachu\u00e9 embodiment, returns to stage wearing a golden belly dancing attire with her back to the crowd and a mask on the back of her head; all costume pieces are designed by Laurel Dewitt. Right after this dance personification, she executes her signature belly dancing and sings the Sahara Mix of her 2001 smash hit \"[[Whenever, Wherever]]\" (that previously served as the encore act for her [[Tour of the Mongoose]]); in the halfway, one more belly dance break is done, this in a very similar way of the one happened during \"[[Ojos As\u00ed]]\" at her [[The Sun Comes Out World Tour|immediately previous tour]].\n\nSeconding this one-song act, an \"Underwater interlude\" is shown as a backdrop consisting of outtake scenes of Shakira's underwater videos shot for \"[[Trap (Shakira song)|Trap]]\" music clip, along with her disserting about the meaning of life. The third act comes out when Cuban percussionist Albert Men\u00e9ndez, a longtime contributor of her band, plays a piano, and Shakira is spotted at a corner of stage singing her 1998 ballad \"[[T\u00fa (song)|T\u00fa]]\" (in its most known ''[[MTV Unplugged (Shakira album)|MTV Unplugged]]'' live incarnation, but missing second verse and chorus), whilst dressed up with black outfits designed by fashion houses [[Agent Provocateur]] and Koral, alongside with chain bracelets by Elena Staun and a long avantgarde jacket by Israeli fashionist Liona Taragan. Following this up, \"[[Amarillo (Shakira song)|Amarillo]]\" comes, with her playing a drawing-decorated acoustic guitar, which is raised at the end of song, revealing a picture of her partner, the Spanish football player [[Gerard Piqu\u00e9]], along with their 2 sons, Milan and Sasha. She takes off the Taragan jacket soon as her smash hit duet with [[Alejandro Sanz]], \"[[La Tortura]],\" starts. Both Sanz (in-off) and Men\u00e9ndez do the male lyrics. Soon, Shakira brings most part of her band to the B-stage to join her to perform altogether an early tune of hers, \"[[Antolog\u00eda (song)|Antolog\u00eda]],\" in a reminder of the same song rendition at selected dates of the [[Oral Fixation Tour]]. When it is over, the band returns to their original places, while she has a short talk to her drummer Brendan Buckley, that leads to 2014 hit \"[[Can't Remember to Forget You]],\" in a new [[reggae music|reggae]] arrangement. Towards its final, the song turns into a heavier rock version as Shakira plays frenzily the drums, in company of [[Rihanna]] singing part of chorus on the sidescreens. This section ends thereafter with a [[merengue music|merengue]] medley of two ''[[Sale El Sol]]'' hits, \"[[Loca (Shakira song)|Loca]]\" and \"[[Rabiosa (song)|Rabiosa]].\"\n\nAs Shakira leaves the stage, an instrumental-only violin version interlude of her 2016 comeback hit, \"[[La Bicicleta]],\" is played by band member Caitlin Evanson, while the other musicians play characteristic samples of [[Queen (band)|Queen]]'s worldwide  hit \"[[We Will Rock You]].\" Four big drums are put in the front of main stage (one for each musicist but the bassist), and Shakira goes back, wearing a red and yellow (signing colors shared by the flags of [[Colombia]] and [[Spain]], besides [[Catalonia]]) ostrich skirt, designed by Hawaiian clothing line Iheartpolynesia, to dance and sing a medley of her [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]] hits \"[[Dare (La La La)|La La La (Brazil 2014)]]\" (2014) and \"[[Waka Waka (This Time for Africa)|Waka Waka]]\" (2010).\n\nFor the encore, there is an \"Education Interlude:\" a [[short movie]] to raise awareness for children who are deprived of any kind of education, portraiting the daily fight of kids around the world in the most underprivileged areas putting maximum efforts to receive education. As it ends, Shakira arrives to a small round stage located in the middle of the crowd in a gold dress and sings a shortened version of \"Toneladas\" (being this song removed on both Istanbul and Bsharri nights - same happened to \"Antolog\u00eda\"); after that, she removes her golden dress to reveal a pink Colombian dress (being both outfits designed by [[Barranquilla]]-born stylist Juan Carlos Obando), and runs through the crowd greeting and  hugging her fans, returning to the main stage to perform her 2006 [[Billboard Hot 100]] chart topper \"[[Hips Don't Lie]];\" closing the concert, she tells the audience about her hometown roots and does an [[a cappella]] snippet of \"La Bicicleta,\" which is succeeded by a full length, full band accompanied version of the duet with fellow Colombian [[Carlos Vives]], who has also his presence on the circular screens. As Shakira says goodbye to the audience, colorful confetti showers explode as an extra thanks to fans (firework shows were added for this part during the Latin American concerts too).\n\n==Critical reception==\n\n===Europe & Asia=== \n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Shakira in Estadio Azteca.png|thumb|right|Shakira performing on stage in [[Estadio Azteca]], [[Mexico City, Mexico]], where she sold out 2 nights in the stadium, becoming the third artist in history only after [[Gloria Estefan]] and [[Michael Jackson]]]] -->\nThe tour received general to universal acclaim.

Structurally, netrin  resembles the extracellular matrix protein [[laminin]].\n\nNetrins are [[chemotropism|chemotropic]]; a growing [[axon]] will either move towards or away from a higher concentration of netrin. Though the detailed mechanism of [[axon guidance]] is not fully understood, it is known that netrin attraction is mediated through [[UNC-40/DCC]] cell surface [[cell surface receptor|receptor]]s and repulsion is mediated through [[UNC-5]] receptors. Netrins also act as [[growth factors]], encouraging cell growth activities in target cells. Mice deficient in netrin fail to form the [[hippocampal comissure]] or the [[corpus callosum]].\n\nA proposed [[Scientific modelling|model]] for netrin activity in the [[spinal column]] of developing human [[embryos]] is that netrins are released by the [[floor plate]] and then are picked up by receptor proteins embedded in the [[growth cones]] of axons belonging to neurons in the developing spinal column. The bodies of these neurons remain stationary while the axons follow a path defined by netrins, eventually connecting to neurons inside the embryonic brain by developing [[synapses]]. Research supports that new axons tend to follow previously traced pathways, rather than being guided by netrins or related chemotropic factors.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0092-8674(94)90421-9 |title=Netrins are diffusible chemotropic factors for commissural axons in the embryonic spinal cord |year=1994 |last1=Kennedy |first1=Timothy E. |last2=Serafini |first2=Tito |last3=De La Torre |first3=Jos\u00e9r. |last4=Tessier-Lavigne |first4=Marc |journal=Cell |volume=78 |issue=3 |pages=425\u201335 |pmid=8062385}}</ref>\n\n==Discovery==\nNetrin was first described in the nematode ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans]]'' in 1990, and named UNC-6, according to standard ''C. elegans'' naming protocol.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/0896-6273(90)90444-K |title=The unc-5, unc-6, and unc-40 genes guide circumferential migrations of pioneer axons and mesodermal cells on the epidermis in C.

Expressed in the midline of all animals possessing [[bilateral symmetry]], they can act as long or short range signals during [[neurogenesis]]. In order to carry out their functions, netrins interact with specific receptors: [[Deleted in Colorectal Cancer|DCC]] or [[UNC-5]], depending on whether they are trying to attract or repel neurons, respectively.\n\nThere is a high degree of conservation in the secondary structure of netrins, which has several domains which are homologous with laminin at the amino terminal end. The C-terminal domain is where most of the variation is found between species and contains different amino acids which allow interaction with specific proteins in extracellular matrix or on cell the surface.

Mice with mutations in the netrin-1 gene were observed to be lacking in forebrain and spinal cord commissural axons.\n\nNetrin-3 is different from other netrins. While expressed during development of the peripheral nervous system in the motor, sensory and sympathetic neurons, it is very limited in the central nervous system.<ref name=\"Barallobre\"/> Studies with netrin-3 have noticed a reduced ability to bind with DCC when compared with netrin-1. This suggests that it mainly operates through other receptors.\n\nNetrins-G are secreted but remain bound to the extracellular surface of the cell membrane through [[Glycophosphatidylinositol]] (GPI). They are expressed predominantly in the central nervous system in places such as the [[thalamus]] and mitral cells of the [[olfactory bulb]].<ref name=\"Barallobre\"/> They do not bind to DCC or UNC-5 and instead bind to ligand NGL-1, which results in an intracellular transduction cascade. The two versions, netrin-G1 and netrin-G2, are found only in vertebrates. It is believed that they evolved independently of other netrins in order to facilitate the construction of the brain.\n\n===Netrin receptors===\nDCC and [[UNC-5]] proteins mediate netrin-1 responses. The UNC-5 protein is mainly involved in signaling repulsion. DCC, which is implicated in attraction, can also serve as a co-factor in repulsion signaling when far away from the source of netrin-1. DCC is highly expressed in the central nervous system and associated with the [[basal lamina]] of epithelial cells. In the absence of netrin-1, these receptors are known to induce [[apoptosis]].<ref name=\"Barallobre\"/>\n\n==Axonal guidance==\n[[Growth cones]] that are located at the end of developing axons during embryogenesis are responsible for the elongation of the axon during [[neural migration|migration]]. Elongation occurs in response to both tropic and atropic factors present in the surrounding environment. Netrins are one such tropic factor secreted by axonal target cells that function as a crucial axonal guidance protein in both vertebrate and invertebrate organisms. Studies in multiple organisms including, mice, rats, chicks, the nematode ''Caenorhabditis elegans'', the fruit fly ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'' and the zebrafish ''[[Danio rerio]]'' have indicated that secreted netrins are bifunctional, meaning that they can act as either attractants or repellants in directing axonal extension. In addition, many studies have characterized netrins as both short and long range cues, acting in the immediate or distant vicinity of their source cell (the axonal target cell).<ref name=\"Dickson 2002\"/>\n\n===Attraction===\nStudies of [[central nervous system]] (CNS) development in chick and rodent models have identified the netrin-1 protein as a particularly important vertebrate axonal guidance cue. Most significantly, it was observed that the specialized cells of the [[floor plate]] located at the ventral midline of the embryonic brain secrete netrin-1, which resulted in a protein gradient. This gradient is most concentrated at the ventral midline and becomes increasingly diffuse as you move dorsally. Additional research in netrin deficient mice found that when netrin associates with the [[Deleted in Colorectal Cancer]] (DCC) receptor on the axonal growth cone an attractant response is initiated. This was further supported by an observed absence of ventral commissure (i.e. [[corpus callosum]]) development in mice lacking either netrin-1 or DCC. Similar results were observed in experiments with the netrin-1 homolog UNC-6 discovered in ''C. elegans''<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1242/dev.068841 |title=UNC-6/netrin and its receptors UNC-5 and UNC-40/DCC modulate growth cone protrusion in vivo in C.

As additional axons reach the midline, the temporal and spatial expression of UNC-6 becomes increasing restricted, indicating that after a more general dorsal-ventral guidance of axons, UNC-6 is further involved in directing axons to more specific locations.<ref name=\"raj\"/><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1101/cshperspect.a001941 |title=Signaling from Axon Guidance Receptors |year=2010 |last1=Bashaw |first1=G.

In all three pathways netrin-1 is observed to cause the [[homodimerization]] of DCC that begins the chemoattraction cascade. In the first pathway, the focal adhesion kinase [[focal adhesion kinase|(FAK)]] is bound to DCC and both undergo tyrosine phosphorylation upon netrin-1 binding that induces the recruitment and phosphorylation of [[Src (gene)|Src]] and [[Fyn]], which is hypothesized to lead to an increase in second messengers [[Rac1]] and [[Cdc42]] thereby promoting growth cone extension. In a second possible pathway, phosphatidylinositol transfer protein \u03b1 (PITP) binds to phosphorylated DCC which induces phospholipase C [[Phospholipase C|(PLC)]] to increase the ratio of [[cyclic adenosine monophosphate|cAMP]] to [[cyclic guanosine monophosphate|cGMP]]. This increase of cAMP relative to cGMP  activates L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels as well as [[transient receptor potential channels]] (TRPC's) causing an influx of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Evidence suggests that this increased calcium is responsible for the activation of  Rho GTPases, Cdc42 Rac1 and the nuclear transcription factor [[NFAT]] which can all initiate growth cone extension. Additional studies have also shown that netrin-induced signaling between DCC downstream targets NcK, and [[Wiskott\u2013Aldrich syndrome]] protein WASP trigger Rac1 and Cdc42 and subsequently axonal growth.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.biocel.2008.03.014 |title=Netrin-1: Diversity in development |year=2009 |last1=Bradford |first1=Danakai |last2=Cole |first2=Stacey J. |last3=Cooper |first3=Helen M. |journal=The International Journal of Biochemistry & Cell Biology |volume=41 |issue=3 |pages=487}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4963-03.2004 |title=Netrin-1 and Semaphorin 3A Promote or Inhibit Cortical Axon Branching, Respectively, by Reorganization of the Cytoskeleton |year=2004 |last1=Dent |first1=E.

In the same ventral midline gradient discussed above, netrin-1 acts as a [[Chemorepulsion|chemorepellant]] for axons of the trochlear motor neurons, thus directing their growth dorsally (away from the ventral midline). Antibody inhibition of DCC in embryonic ''[[Xenopus]]'' spinal cord inhibited both attraction and repulsion in vitro. Likewise, multiple defects were observed in ''C. elegans'' unc-40 mutants; however, errors in migration patterns were more profoundly affected by mutations in the unc-5 gene, indicating that binding of the netrin-1 homologue UNC-6 to the UNC-5 receptor alone can repel axonal growth. In both vertebrate and invertebrate systems, short range [[chemorepulsion]] in which the concentration of netrins is high, seems to primarily occur via the UNC-5 receptor, while long range repulsive effects at more diffuse concentrations require coordination between DCC (UNC-40 in ''C.elegans'') and UNC-5.<ref name=\"raj\"/><ref>{{cite journal |first1=Andrew A. |last1=Jarjour |first2=Colleen |last2=Manitt |first3=Simon W. |last3=Moore |first4=Katherine M. |last4=Thompson |first5=Sung-Joo |last5=Yuh |first6=Timothy E. |last6=Kennedy |title=Netrin-1 Is a Chemorepellent for Oligodendrocyte Precursor Cells in the Embryonic Spinal Cord |journal=The Journal of Neuroscience |pmid=12736344 |url=http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=12736344 |year=2003 |volume=23 |issue=9 |pages=3735\u201344}}</ref>\n\nIt is currently hypothesized that long range chemorepulsion involves initiation of the [[Arachidonic acid]] pathway upon netrin-1 interaction with the DCC/UNC-5 complex.  This pathway increases the intracellular levels of 12-HPETE (12-Hydroperoxy-5, 8, 10, 14-Eicosatetraenoic Acid), which induces cGMP signaling and subsequently causes a decrease in the cAMP/cGMP ratio. Reducing this ratio inhibits calcium conductance through the [[L-type calcium channels]] (LCC) and ultimately results in growth cone repulsion though a possible activation of [[RHOA|Ras homolog gene family, member A (RhoA)]].  A similar RhoA-mediated mechanism is proposed for short range chemorepulsion whereby netrin-1 binding to UNC-5 homodimers alone induces tyrosine phosphorylation requiring FAK and Src, which as a result activates RhoA. An additional mechanism proposes that binding of the tyrosine phosphatase [[PTPN11|Shp2]] to the netrin-1/UNC-5 complex may also trigger chemorepulsion through RhoA.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/nature01751 |title=Cyclic AMP/GMP-dependent modulation of Ca2+ channels sets the polarity of nerve growth-cone turning |year=2003 |last1=Nishiyama |first1=Makoto |last2=Hoshino |first2=Akemi |last3=Tsai |first3=Lily |last4=Henley |first4=John R. |last5=Goshima |first5=Yoshio |last6=Tessier-Lavigne |first6=Marc |last7=Poo |first7=Mu-Ming |authorlink7=Mu-ming Poo |last8=Hong |first8=Kyonsoo |journal=Nature |volume=423 |issue=6943 |pages=990\u20135 |pmid=12827203|bibcode=2003Natur.423..990N }}</ref>\n\n==Glial and mesodermal guidance==\nMany studies have shown that [[netrin-1]], UNC-40, UNC-6, and UNC-5 are involved in the migration of [[glia]] during [[embryogenesis]].<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/cr.2010.7 |title=Netrin-1 signaling mediates NO-induced glial precursor migration and accumulation |year=2010 |last1=Chen |first1=Hongwei |last2=Wei |first2=Qiang |last3=Zhang |first3=Jing |last4=Xu |first4=Chuangkun |last5=Tan |first5=Tao |last6=Ji |first6=Weizhi |journal=Cell Research |volume=20 |issue=2 |pages=238\u201341 |pmid=20084084}}</ref><ref name= \"von hilchem\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1242/dev.042853 |title=Netrins guide migration of distinct glial cells in the Drosophila embryo |year=2010 |last1=Von Hilchen |first1=C.

It has also been shown that certain receptors become down-regulated in this process. The netrin receptors DCC and UNC5H are responsible for [[Apoptosis#Mitochondrial regulation|apoptotic regulation]].  The absence of netrin 1 is responsible for apoptosis, while the presence of netrin 1 leads to an inhibition of the [[apoptotic pathway]].  This pathway is unique and independent of the mitochondrial and [[Fas receptor|death receptor]] pathways that lead to controlled cell death. This has been observed in the human colon epithelium, where higher levels of natural cell death at the upper portion of the villi correlated with a smaller gradient of netrin-1. This linked the role of netrin with tissue death and growth.  Tumor suppressor [[p53]] is responsible for the expression of netrin-1, implying that netrin may be the pathway through which p53 regulates the [[cell cycle]].

Though the detailed mechanism of [[axon guidance]] is not fully understood, it is known that netrin attraction is mediated through [[UNC-40/DCC]] cell surface [[cell surface receptor|receptor]]s and repulsion is mediated through [[UNC-5]] receptors. Netrins also act as [[growth factors]], encouraging cell growth activities in target cells. Mice deficient in netrin fail to form the [[hippocampal comissure]] or the [[corpus callosum]].\n\nA proposed [[Scientific modelling|model]] for netrin activity in the [[spinal column]] of developing human [[embryos]] is that netrins are released by the [[floor plate]] and then are picked up by receptor proteins embedded in the [[growth cones]] of axons belonging to neurons in the developing spinal column. The bodies of these neurons remain stationary while the axons follow a path defined by netrins, eventually connecting to neurons inside the embryonic brain by developing [[synapses]].

Expressed in the midline of all animals possessing [[bilateral symmetry]], they can act as long or short range signals during [[neurogenesis]]. In order to carry out their functions, netrins interact with specific receptors: [[Deleted in Colorectal Cancer|DCC]] or [[UNC-5]], depending on whether they are trying to attract or repel neurons, respectively.\n\nThere is a high degree of conservation in the secondary structure of netrins, which has several domains which are homologous with laminin at the amino terminal end. The C-terminal domain is where most of the variation is found between species and contains different amino acids which allow interaction with specific proteins in extracellular matrix or on cell the surface. The differences in terms of structure and function have led to the identifications of several different types of netrins including netrin-1, netrin-3, and netrins-G.<ref name=\"Dickson 2002\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.1072165 |title=Molecular Mechanisms of Axon Guidance |year=2002 |last1=Dickson |first1=B.

Mice with mutations in the netrin-1 gene were observed to be lacking in forebrain and spinal cord commissural axons.\n\nNetrin-3 is different from other netrins. While expressed during development of the peripheral nervous system in the motor, sensory and sympathetic neurons, it is very limited in the central nervous system.<ref name=\"Barallobre\"/> Studies with netrin-3 have noticed a reduced ability to bind with DCC when compared with netrin-1. This suggests that it mainly operates through other receptors.\n\nNetrins-G are secreted but remain bound to the extracellular surface of the cell membrane through [[Glycophosphatidylinositol]] (GPI). They are expressed predominantly in the central nervous system in places such as the [[thalamus]] and mitral cells of the [[olfactory bulb]].<ref name=\"Barallobre\"/> They do not bind to DCC or UNC-5 and instead bind to ligand NGL-1, which results in an intracellular transduction cascade. The two versions, netrin-G1 and netrin-G2, are found only in vertebrates. It is believed that they evolved independently of other netrins in order to facilitate the construction of the brain.\n\n===Netrin receptors===\nDCC and [[UNC-5]] proteins mediate netrin-1 responses. The UNC-5 protein is mainly involved in signaling repulsion. DCC, which is implicated in attraction, can also serve as a co-factor in repulsion signaling when far away from the source of netrin-1. DCC is highly expressed in the central nervous system and associated with the [[basal lamina]] of epithelial cells. In the absence of netrin-1, these receptors are known to induce [[apoptosis]].<ref name=\"Barallobre\"/>\n\n==Axonal guidance==\n[[Growth cones]] that are located at the end of developing axons during embryogenesis are responsible for the elongation of the axon during [[neural migration|migration]]. Elongation occurs in response to both tropic and atropic factors present in the surrounding environment. Netrins are one such tropic factor secreted by axonal target cells that function as a crucial axonal guidance protein in both vertebrate and invertebrate organisms. Studies in multiple organisms including, mice, rats, chicks, the nematode ''Caenorhabditis elegans'', the fruit fly ''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'' and the zebrafish ''[[Danio rerio]]'' have indicated that secreted netrins are bifunctional, meaning that they can act as either attractants or repellants in directing axonal extension. In addition, many studies have characterized netrins as both short and long range cues, acting in the immediate or distant vicinity of their source cell (the axonal target cell).<ref name=\"Dickson 2002\"/>\n\n===Attraction===\nStudies of [[central nervous system]] (CNS) development in chick and rodent models have identified the netrin-1 protein as a particularly important vertebrate axonal guidance cue. Most significantly, it was observed that the specialized cells of the [[floor plate]] located at the ventral midline of the embryonic brain secrete netrin-1, which resulted in a protein gradient. This gradient is most concentrated at the ventral midline and becomes increasingly diffuse as you move dorsally. Additional research in netrin deficient mice found that when netrin associates with the [[Deleted in Colorectal Cancer]] (DCC) receptor on the axonal growth cone an attractant response is initiated. This was further supported by an observed absence of ventral commissure (i.e. [[corpus callosum]]) development in mice lacking either netrin-1 or DCC. Similar results were observed in experiments with the netrin-1 homolog UNC-6 discovered in ''C. elegans''<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1242/dev.068841 |title=UNC-6/netrin and its receptors UNC-5 and UNC-40/DCC modulate growth cone protrusion in vivo in C.

As additional axons reach the midline, the temporal and spatial expression of UNC-6 becomes increasing restricted, indicating that after a more general dorsal-ventral guidance of axons, UNC-6 is further involved in directing axons to more specific locations.<ref name=\"raj\"/><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1101/cshperspect.a001941 |title=Signaling from Axon Guidance Receptors |year=2010 |last1=Bashaw |first1=G.

In all three pathways netrin-1 is observed to cause the [[homodimerization]] of DCC that begins the chemoattraction cascade. In the first pathway, the focal adhesion kinase [[focal adhesion kinase|(FAK)]] is bound to DCC and both undergo tyrosine phosphorylation upon netrin-1 binding that induces the recruitment and phosphorylation of [[Src (gene)|Src]] and [[Fyn]], which is hypothesized to lead to an increase in second messengers [[Rac1]] and [[Cdc42]] thereby promoting growth cone extension. In a second possible pathway, phosphatidylinositol transfer protein \u03b1 (PITP) binds to phosphorylated DCC which induces phospholipase C [[Phospholipase C|(PLC)]] to increase the ratio of [[cyclic adenosine monophosphate|cAMP]] to [[cyclic guanosine monophosphate|cGMP]]. This increase of cAMP relative to cGMP  activates L-type Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels as well as [[transient receptor potential channels]] (TRPC's) causing an influx of extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>. Evidence suggests that this increased calcium is responsible for the activation of  Rho GTPases, Cdc42 Rac1 and the nuclear transcription factor [[NFAT]] which can all initiate growth cone extension. Additional studies have also shown that netrin-induced signaling between DCC downstream targets NcK, and [[Wiskott\u2013Aldrich syndrome]] protein WASP trigger Rac1 and Cdc42 and subsequently axonal growth.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.biocel.2008.03.014 |title=Netrin-1: Diversity in development |year=2009 |last1=Bradford |first1=Danakai |last2=Cole |first2=Stacey J. |last3=Cooper |first3=Helen M. |journal=The International Journal of Biochemistry & Cell Biology |volume=41 |issue=3 |pages=487}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.4963-03.2004 |title=Netrin-1 and Semaphorin 3A Promote or Inhibit Cortical Axon Branching, Respectively, by Reorganization of the Cytoskeleton |year=2004 |last1=Dent |first1=E.

In the same ventral midline gradient discussed above, netrin-1 acts as a [[Chemorepulsion|chemorepellant]] for axons of the trochlear motor neurons, thus directing their growth dorsally (away from the ventral midline). Antibody inhibition of DCC in embryonic ''[[Xenopus]]'' spinal cord inhibited both attraction and repulsion in vitro. Likewise, multiple defects were observed in ''C. elegans'' unc-40 mutants; however, errors in migration patterns were more profoundly affected by mutations in the unc-5 gene, indicating that binding of the netrin-1 homologue UNC-6 to the UNC-5 receptor alone can repel axonal growth. In both vertebrate and invertebrate systems, short range [[chemorepulsion]] in which the concentration of netrins is high, seems to primarily occur via the UNC-5 receptor, while long range repulsive effects at more diffuse concentrations require coordination between DCC (UNC-40 in ''C.elegans'') and UNC-5.<ref name=\"raj\"/><ref>{{cite journal |first1=Andrew A. |last1=Jarjour |first2=Colleen |last2=Manitt |first3=Simon W. |last3=Moore |first4=Katherine M. |last4=Thompson |first5=Sung-Joo |last5=Yuh |first6=Timothy E. |last6=Kennedy |title=Netrin-1 Is a Chemorepellent for Oligodendrocyte Precursor Cells in the Embryonic Spinal Cord |journal=The Journal of Neuroscience |pmid=12736344 |url=http://www.jneurosci.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&pmid=12736344 |year=2003 |volume=23 |issue=9 |pages=3735\u201344}}</ref>\n\nIt is currently hypothesized that long range chemorepulsion involves initiation of the [[Arachidonic acid]] pathway upon netrin-1 interaction with the DCC/UNC-5 complex.  This pathway increases the intracellular levels of 12-HPETE (12-Hydroperoxy-5, 8, 10, 14-Eicosatetraenoic Acid), which induces cGMP signaling and subsequently causes a decrease in the cAMP/cGMP ratio. Reducing this ratio inhibits calcium conductance through the [[L-type calcium channels]] (LCC) and ultimately results in growth cone repulsion though a possible activation of [[RHOA|Ras homolog gene family, member A (RhoA)]].  A similar RhoA-mediated mechanism is proposed for short range chemorepulsion whereby netrin-1 binding to UNC-5 homodimers alone induces tyrosine phosphorylation requiring FAK and Src, which as a result activates RhoA. An additional mechanism proposes that binding of the tyrosine phosphatase [[PTPN11|Shp2]] to the netrin-1/UNC-5 complex may also trigger chemorepulsion through RhoA.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/nature01751 |title=Cyclic AMP/GMP-dependent modulation of Ca2+ channels sets the polarity of nerve growth-cone turning |year=2003 |last1=Nishiyama |first1=Makoto |last2=Hoshino |first2=Akemi |last3=Tsai |first3=Lily |last4=Henley |first4=John R. |last5=Goshima |first5=Yoshio |last6=Tessier-Lavigne |first6=Marc |last7=Poo |first7=Mu-Ming |authorlink7=Mu-ming Poo |last8=Hong |first8=Kyonsoo |journal=Nature |volume=423 |issue=6943 |pages=990\u20135 |pmid=12827203|bibcode=2003Natur.423..990N }}</ref>\n\n==Glial and mesodermal guidance==\nMany studies have shown that [[netrin-1]], UNC-40, UNC-6, and UNC-5 are involved in the migration of [[glia]] during [[embryogenesis]].<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/cr.2010.7 |title=Netrin-1 signaling mediates NO-induced glial precursor migration and accumulation |year=2010 |last1=Chen |first1=Hongwei |last2=Wei |first2=Qiang |last3=Zhang |first3=Jing |last4=Xu |first4=Chuangkun |last5=Tan |first5=Tao |last6=Ji |first6=Weizhi |journal=Cell Research |volume=20 |issue=2 |pages=238\u201341 |pmid=20084084}}</ref><ref name= \"von hilchem\">{{cite journal |doi=10.1242/dev.042853 |title=Netrins guide migration of distinct glial cells in the Drosophila embryo |year=2010 |last1=Von Hilchen |first1=C.

Little is known of the mechanism controlling the inhibition or attraction of these stem cells.<ref name=\"karen\"/><ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1073/pnas.0703240104 |title=Adult spinal cord progenitor cells are repelled by netrin-1 in the embryonic and injured adult spinal cord |year=2007 |last1=Petit |first1=Audrey |last2=Sellers |first2=Drew L. |last3=Liebl |first3=Daniel J. |last4=Tessier-Lavigne |first4=Marc |last5=Kennedy |first5=Timothy E. |last6=Horner |first6=Philip J. |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences |volume=104 |issue=45 |pages=17837\u201342 |jstor=25450329 |bibcode=2007PNAS..10417837P |pmid=17978191 |pmc=2077035}}</ref>\n\n===Cancer regulation and disease markers===\nIn various human cancers, it has been shown that netrin becomes over-expressed. It has also been shown that certain receptors become down-regulated in this process. The netrin receptors DCC and UNC5H are responsible for [[Apoptosis#Mitochondrial regulation|apoptotic regulation]].  The absence of netrin 1 is responsible for apoptosis, while the presence of netrin 1 leads to an inhibition of the [[apoptotic pathway]].  This pathway is unique and independent of the mitochondrial and [[Fas receptor|death receptor]] pathways that lead to controlled cell death. This has been observed in the human colon epithelium, where higher levels of natural cell death at the upper portion of the villi correlated with a smaller gradient of netrin-1. This linked the role of netrin with tissue death and growth.  Tumor suppressor [[p53]] is responsible for the expression of netrin-1, implying that netrin may be the pathway through which p53 regulates the [[cell cycle]]. Because netrin is so influential in the regulation of cell death, the gene which codes for netrin (''NTN1'') is considered to be an [[oncogene]].<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/nrc1504 |title=Netrin-1 and its receptors in tumorigenesis |year=2004 |last1=Arakawa |first1=Hirofumi |journal=Nature Reviews Cancer |volume=4 |issue=12 |pages=978\u201387 |pmid=15573119}}</ref>\n\nBecause netrin-1 has been found to be upregulated in tumors, recent research has attempted to identify netrin-1 as a [[biomarker]] for the onset of cancer in the human body. It was found that netrin can be found at above-normal levels in the blood plasma of patients who are positive for renal, liver, prostate, meningioma of brain, pituitary adenoma, glioblastoma and breast cancer.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.3109/1354750X.2010.541564 |title=Plasma netrin-1 is a diagnostic biomarker of human cancers |year=2011 |last1=Ramesh |first1=Ganesan |last2=Berg |first2=Arthur |last3=Jayakumar |first3=Calpurnia |journal=Biomarkers |volume=16 |issue=2 |pages=172\u201380 |pmid=21303223 |pmc=3143477}}</ref>\n\n==Continued research on netrin==\nThere are still many unanswered questions regarding the netrin family of molecules.  It is still uncertain what role vertebrate homologues of UNC-5 play in [[chemorepulsion]]. Although much is known about the expression of netrin during development, little is yet known about its regulation in later development in the brain. Netrin knockout mice show that there is much to learn about the many roles of netrin in axonal guidance.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0960-9822(06)00007-8 |title=Axon guidance: Netrin receptors are revealed |year=1997 |last1=Guthrie |first1=Sarah |journal=Current Biology |volume=7 |pages=R6\u20139 |pmid=9072174 |issue=1}}</ref>\n\nAnother important line of current research targets netrin as a treatment for various diseases, including cancer, [[myocardial infarction]], and [[Alzheimer's Disease]].

Initially, it seemed that Rifaat was going to be put on trial and even faced a questioning that was broadcast on television. However, it is believed that Hafez's daughter [[Bushra al-Assad|Bushra]] actually saved her uncle by convincing her father that purging him would disgrace the family and might cause tensions not only in the Assad family, but with the Makhlouf family as well (since Rifaat is also married to a woman from that family, who are also the second most prevalent Alawite family, dominating the leadership of the security services behind the Assads).<ref name=\"mideastmonitor\">[http://www.mideastmonitor.org/issues/0609/0609_5.htm Dossier: Bushra Assad (September-October 2006)<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721161959/http://www.mideastmonitor.org/issues/0609/0609_5.htm |date=21 July 2011 }}</ref> In what at first seemed a compromise, Rifaat was made vice-president with responsibility for security affairs, but this proved a wholly nominal post. Command of the 'Defense Companies', which was trimmed down to an Armoured Division size, was transferred to another officer, and ultimately the entire unit was disbanded and absorbed into other units, like the 4th Mechanized Division, the Republican Guard, and the Airborne Special Forces Division. Rifaat was then sent to the [[Soviet Union]] on \"an open-ended working visit\".

However, the [[1999 Latakia protests|1999 crackdown]], involving armed clashes in [[Lattakia]], destroyed much of his remaining network in Syria; large numbers of Rifaat's supporters were arrested. This was seen as tied to the issue of succession, with Rifaat having begun to position himself to succeed the ailing Hafez, who in his turn sought to eliminate all potential competition for his designated successor, his son [[Bashar al-Assad]].\n\nIn France, Rifaat has loudly protested against the succession of Bashar to the post of [[President of Syria|president]], claiming that he himself embodies the \"only constitutional legality\" (as vice president, alleging his dismissal was unconstitutional). He has made threatening remarks about planning to return to Syria at a time of his choosing to assume \"his responsibilities and fulfill the will of the people\", and that while he will rule benevolently and democratically, he will do so with \"the power of the people and the army\" behind him.\n\n== Groups and organizations ==\n\nRifaat's son Sumer is the head of a minor pan-Arab TV channel, the [[Arab News Network]] (ANN), which functions as his father's political mouthpiece.

Abdullah was married to a sister of Rifaat's wife, and Rifaat has on occasions\u2014even after his public estrangement from the rulers in Syria\u2014been invited to Saudi Arabia, with pictures of him and the royal family displayed in the state-controlled press.\n\nIt is claimed that Rifaat is reputed to have turned even to [[Israel]] asking for assistance, and that he has initiated contacts with exiled representatives of the Muslim Brotherhood.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} After the [[Iraq War]], there were press reports that he had started talks with US government representatives on helping to form a coalition with other anti-Assad groups to provide an alternative Syrian leadership, on the model of the [[Iraqi National Congress]]. Rifaat has held a meeting with the former [[Iraq]]i [[Prime Minister of Iraq|Prime Minister]] [[Ayad Allawi]]. [[Yossef Bodansky]], the director of the US [[Congressional Task Force on Terrorism and Unconventional Warfare]], has stated that Rifaat enjoys support from both America and [[Saudi Arabia]]; he has been featured in the Saudi press as visiting the royal family in 2007. The Bashar government remains wary of his intentions and carefully monitors his activities.\n\nRifaat was mentioned by the influential American think tank [[Stratfor]] as a possible suspect for the 2005 bombing that killed [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] ex-prime minister [[Rafiq Hariri]] and the string of attacks that has struck [[Beirut]] after the subsequent Syrian withdrawal. The goal would be to destabilize the Syrian government. However, there has been no mention of Rifaat in the [[United Nations]] [[Mehlis report]]s on the crime.\n\nIn 2010, Rifaat was living in [[Mayfair]], [[London]].<ref name=tel8571164>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/syria/8571164/Syrias-Butcher-of-Hama-living-in-10-million-Mayfair-townhouse.html|title=Syria's 'Butcher of Hama' living in \u00a310 million Mayfair townhouse|date=12 June 2011|work=Telegraph|accessdate=20 April 2015|location=London|first=Gordon|last=Rayner}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/commentators/fisk/robert-fisk-freedom-democracy-and-human-rights-in-syria-2080463.html|title=Robert Fisk: Freedom, democracy and human rights in Syria|work=The Independent|accessdate=20 April 2015|location=London|date=16 September 2010}}</ref> {{As of|2011}} he is living in [[Avenue Foch]], [[Paris]],<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2100180,00.html|title=The Syrian Leader's Exiled Uncle Vows to Topple the Regime \u2013 TIME|date=24 November 2011|work=Time|accessdate=20 April 2015}}</ref> while trying to sell off his real estate properties.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/syria/8811097/Syria-Assad-family-selling-off-overseas-property-empire.html|title=Syria: Assad family 'selling off overseas property empire'|author=Nabila Ramdani|date=6 October 2011|work=Telegraph|accessdate=20 April 2015|location=London}}</ref>\n\n[[Ion Mihai Pacepa]], a general in the [[Securitate|security forces]] of [[Socialist Republic of Romania|Communist Romania]] who defected to the U.S. in 1978, claimed that Rifaat al-Assad was recruited by Romanian intelligence during the Cold War.

Command of the 'Defense Companies', which was trimmed down to an Armoured Division size, was transferred to another officer, and ultimately the entire unit was disbanded and absorbed into other units, like the 4th Mechanized Division, the Republican Guard, and the Airborne Special Forces Division. Rifaat was then sent to the [[Soviet Union]] on \"an open-ended working visit\". His closest supporters and others who had failed to prove their loyalty to Hafez were purged from the army and Baath Party in the years that followed.

However, the [[1999 Latakia protests|1999 crackdown]], involving armed clashes in [[Lattakia]], destroyed much of his remaining network in Syria; large numbers of Rifaat's supporters were arrested. This was seen as tied to the issue of succession, with Rifaat having begun to position himself to succeed the ailing Hafez, who in his turn sought to eliminate all potential competition for his designated successor, his son [[Bashar al-Assad]].\n\nIn France, Rifaat has loudly protested against the succession of Bashar to the post of [[President of Syria|president]], claiming that he himself embodies the \"only constitutional legality\" (as vice president, alleging his dismissal was unconstitutional). He has made threatening remarks about planning to return to Syria at a time of his choosing to assume \"his responsibilities and fulfill the will of the people\", and that while he will rule benevolently and democratically, he will do so with \"the power of the people and the army\" behind him.\n\n== Groups and organizations ==\n\nRifaat's son Sumer is the head of a minor pan-Arab TV channel, the [[Arab News Network]] (ANN), which functions as his father's political mouthpiece. He also claims to run a political party, of uncertain fortunes. Rifaat himself heads the United National Group (''al-tajammu` al-qawmi al-muwahhid''), which is another political party or alliance; it is known to have self-professed members among Rifaat's fellow exiles from Syria, but neither can be considered an active organization,{{cn|date=February 2020}} even if they will regularly release statements in favor of Rifaat's return to Syria and protesting president [[Bashar al-Assad]]. Further, Rifaat founded the [[Arab Democratic Party (Lebanon)|Arab Democratic Party]] in [[Lebanon]] in the early 1970s, a small [[Alawite]] sectarian/political group in [[Lebanon]], which during the [[Lebanese Civil War]] acted as an armed militia loyal to the Syrian government (through Rifaat).<ref>\"Rifaat founded the Red Knights in northern Lebanon in the early 1970s and they were eventually instrumental in helping Yasser Arafat to slip by sea to Tripoli in 1983...\"{{cite web|url=http://www.naharnet.com/domino/tn/NewsDesk.nsf/story/47F6806256DBA8F8C225705D002ECDDA?OpenDocument |title=Archived copy |accessdate=27 September 2007 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927064551/http://www.naharnet.com/domino/tn/NewsDesk.nsf/story/47F6806256DBA8F8C225705D002ECDDA?OpenDocument |archivedate=27 September 2007 }}</ref> [[Ali Eid]] the general secretary of the party today, supports the Syrian president Bashar Al-Assad.{{fact|date=March 2020}}\n\n== Distinctions ==\n\n{{Clear}}\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:left;\"\n|-\n! style=\"width:90px;\" | Ribbon\n! style=\"width:250px;\" | Distinction\n! style=\"width:120px;\" | Country\n! style=\"width:100px;\" | Date\n! style=\"width:100px;\" | Location\n! style=\"width:250px;\" | Notes\n!

[[Yossef Bodansky]], the director of the US [[Congressional Task Force on Terrorism and Unconventional Warfare]], has stated that Rifaat enjoys support from both America and [[Saudi Arabia]]; he has been featured in the Saudi press as visiting the royal family in 2007. The Bashar government remains wary of his intentions and carefully monitors his activities.\n\nRifaat was mentioned by the influential American think tank [[Stratfor]] as a possible suspect for the 2005 bombing that killed [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] ex-prime minister [[Rafiq Hariri]] and the string of attacks that has struck [[Beirut]] after the subsequent Syrian withdrawal. The goal would be to destabilize the Syrian government.

The infamous English pirate Thomas Bartholomew Red ([[Walter Matthau]]), known as Captain Red, and his ship's teenage cabin boy Jean-Baptiste (Cris Campion), nicknamed \"[[French people|Frog]]\", are lost on a raft without supplies in the ocean. Luckily, Captain Red and Frog are picked up by ''Neptune'', a Spanish galleon en route to Spain. Thrown into the brig, Red and Frog meet the ship's cook Boomako ([[Olu Jacobs]]), imprisoned after being accused of poisoning the ''Neptune's'' captain Linares ([[Ferdy Mayne]]) in a supposed attempt at stealing the golden throne, loot from the Aztec King Capatec Anahuac, that is being secretly transported in the galleon's hold. Captain Red becomes obsessed with capturing the throne for himself. Meanwhile, Frog falls in love with Maria-Dolores ([[Charlotte Lewis]]), the niece of Maracaibo's governor, who is travelling on the ''Neptune'' as a passenger.\n\nCaptain Linares dies and the command of the ship is taken over by his ruthless and ambitious first mate, lieutenant Don Alfonso de la Torr\u00e9 ([[Damien Thomas]]) who is also in love with Maria-Dolores, though she does not reciprocate his feelings. Red and Frog, put to work along with ''Neptune's'' crew, make an attempt at instigating a mutiny. In response, Don Alfonso has them sentenced to death along with a few other mutineers. However, Captain Red devises a plan that allows them to avoid execution and use the ensuing confusion to launch an open rebellion, which proves successful when most of the crew members rally against their masters. After the battle, Frog gains Maria-Dolores' interest when he saves her from an attempted rape, killing one of his fellow mutineers in the process.\n\nPutting himself in command of the ''Neptune'', Captain Red directs the ship to a pirate cove, led by Dutch ([[Roy Kinnear]]), a merchant and old associate of Red. Meeting his former crewmates, Captain Red throws a party and imprisons Don Alfonso and his officers. However, one of Dutch's hostages releases them while the pirates are partying. Don Alfonso and his men return to the ''Neptune'' and retake the ship, sailing away with the golden throne in the morning. Using the money he has gained from Dutch, Captain Red purchases an old brig and pursues the ''Neptune'' to Maracaibo.\n\nAt night, Captain Red, Frog, and Boomako sneak into the governor's residence with Maria-Dolores as their hostage. Red plans to use her as a bargaining chip and force her wealthy uncle to exchange her for the golden throne. Although the governor proves to be unsympathetic for his niece's fate, he becomes more cooperative after Captain Red tortures him instead, finding out that he is suffering from [[Gout|podagra]]. As Red demands, the governor provides him with a document that entitles him to confiscate the golden throne, posing as the governor's secret messenger. However, Red and Frog fail to carry the throne out of the bay and are later captured by Don Alfonso, who puts them in prison. Maria-Dolores visits them in their cell. She reveals her feelings toward Jean-Baptiste as the two embrace and share a kiss. Maria-Dolores returns to the ''Neptune'', which soon sets off to Spain again, with Don Alfonso promoted to captain.\n\nThe pirates, informed by Boomako of what has happened, assault the prison the following night, releasing Red and Frog. Captain Red pursues the ''Neptune'' and launches an assault on the galleon. Red sinks his own ship, making retreat impossible, and secretly orders Boomako to prepare a boat in order to make off with the golden throne. In the heat of battle, Frog finds Maria-Dolores and duels with Don Alfonso over her. However, in the end, he remains loyal to Captain Red, abandoning the fight with Don Alfonso in order to aid his leader in capturing the throne. With the ''Neptune'' burning and beyond repair, her remaining crew and passengers flee on the boat, while Red, Frog, and Boomako make off in one of their own with the golden throne in their possession. With Maria-Dolores out of his reach now, a furious Frog throws insults at Don Alfonso, who tries to shoot him in retaliation. However, Maria-Dolores intervenes desperately, disrupting his aim, and Boomako is shot dead instead. Red and Frog then leave the scene, abandoning their surviving crewmates in the water.\n\nThe last scene from the film mirrors the first one, with Red and Frog finding themselves alone on a small boat in the open ocean once again.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Walter Matthau]] as Captain Thomas Bartholomew Red\n* Cris Campion as Jean-Baptiste/The Frog\n* [[Charlotte Lewis]] as Mar\u00eda-Dolores de la Jenya de la Calde\n* [[Roy Kinnear]] as Dutch\n* [[Roger Ashton-Griffiths]] as Moonhead\n* [[Damien Thomas]] as Don Alfonso de Salamanca de la Torre\n* [[Olu Jacobs]] as Boomako\n* [[Ferdy Mayne]] as Captain Linares\n* [[David Kelly (actor)|David Kelly]] as Surgeon\n* Anthony Peck, [[Anthony Dawson]], Richard Dieux, and Jacques Maury as Spanish officers\n* [[Jos\u00e9 Santamar\u00eda|Jose Santamaria]] as Master at Arms\n* [[Robert Dorning]] as Commander of Marines\n* Luc Jamati as Pepito Gonzalez\n* [[Emilio Fern\u00e1ndez]] as Angelito\n* [[Wladyslaw Komar|Wladislaw Komar]] as Jesus\n\n==Development==\nRiding on the success of the highly acclaimed ''[[Chinatown (1974 film)|Chinatown]]'', [[Roman Polanski]] began to write a screenplay for a swashbuckling adventure film called ''Pirates'' alongside his regular collaborator, Gerard Brach.<ref>Polanski: Laughing But With an Edge By Kenneth Turan.

The infamous English pirate Thomas Bartholomew Red ([[Walter Matthau]]), known as Captain Red, and his ship's teenage cabin boy Jean-Baptiste (Cris Campion), nicknamed \"[[French people|Frog]]\", are lost on a raft without supplies in the ocean. Luckily, Captain Red and Frog are picked up by ''Neptune'', a Spanish galleon en route to Spain. Thrown into the brig, Red and Frog meet the ship's cook Boomako ([[Olu Jacobs]]), imprisoned after being accused of poisoning the ''Neptune's'' captain Linares ([[Ferdy Mayne]]) in a supposed attempt at stealing the golden throne, loot from the Aztec King Capatec Anahuac, that is being secretly transported in the galleon's hold. Captain Red becomes obsessed with capturing the throne for himself. Meanwhile, Frog falls in love with Maria-Dolores ([[Charlotte Lewis]]), the niece of Maracaibo's governor, who is travelling on the ''Neptune'' as a passenger.\n\nCaptain Linares dies and the command of the ship is taken over by his ruthless and ambitious first mate, lieutenant Don Alfonso de la Torr\u00e9 ([[Damien Thomas]]) who is also in love with Maria-Dolores, though she does not reciprocate his feelings. Red and Frog, put to work along with ''Neptune's'' crew, make an attempt at instigating a mutiny. In response, Don Alfonso has them sentenced to death along with a few other mutineers. However, Captain Red devises a plan that allows them to avoid execution and use the ensuing confusion to launch an open rebellion, which proves successful when most of the crew members rally against their masters. After the battle, Frog gains Maria-Dolores' interest when he saves her from an attempted rape, killing one of his fellow mutineers in the process.\n\nPutting himself in command of the ''Neptune'', Captain Red directs the ship to a pirate cove, led by Dutch ([[Roy Kinnear]]), a merchant and old associate of Red. Meeting his former crewmates, Captain Red throws a party and imprisons Don Alfonso and his officers. However, one of Dutch's hostages releases them while the pirates are partying. Don Alfonso and his men return to the ''Neptune'' and retake the ship, sailing away with the golden throne in the morning. Using the money he has gained from Dutch, Captain Red purchases an old brig and pursues the ''Neptune'' to Maracaibo.\n\nAt night, Captain Red, Frog, and Boomako sneak into the governor's residence with Maria-Dolores as their hostage. Red plans to use her as a bargaining chip and force her wealthy uncle to exchange her for the golden throne. Although the governor proves to be unsympathetic for his niece's fate, he becomes more cooperative after Captain Red tortures him instead, finding out that he is suffering from [[Gout|podagra]]. As Red demands, the governor provides him with a document that entitles him to confiscate the golden throne, posing as the governor's secret messenger. However, Red and Frog fail to carry the throne out of the bay and are later captured by Don Alfonso, who puts them in prison. Maria-Dolores visits them in their cell. She reveals her feelings toward Jean-Baptiste as the two embrace and share a kiss. Maria-Dolores returns to the ''Neptune'', which soon sets off to Spain again, with Don Alfonso promoted to captain.\n\nThe pirates, informed by Boomako of what has happened, assault the prison the following night, releasing Red and Frog. Captain Red pursues the ''Neptune'' and launches an assault on the galleon. Red sinks his own ship, making retreat impossible, and secretly orders Boomako to prepare a boat in order to make off with the golden throne. In the heat of battle, Frog finds Maria-Dolores and duels with Don Alfonso over her. However, in the end, he remains loyal to Captain Red, abandoning the fight with Don Alfonso in order to aid his leader in capturing the throne. With the ''Neptune'' burning and beyond repair, her remaining crew and passengers flee on the boat, while Red, Frog, and Boomako make off in one of their own with the golden throne in their possession. With Maria-Dolores out of his reach now, a furious Frog throws insults at Don Alfonso, who tries to shoot him in retaliation. However, Maria-Dolores intervenes desperately, disrupting his aim, and Boomako is shot dead instead. Red and Frog then leave the scene, abandoning their surviving crewmates in the water.\n\nThe last scene from the film mirrors the first one, with Red and Frog finding themselves alone on a small boat in the open ocean once again.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Walter Matthau]] as Captain Thomas Bartholomew Red\n* Cris Campion as Jean-Baptiste/The Frog\n* [[Charlotte Lewis]] as Mar\u00eda-Dolores de la Jenya de la Calde\n* [[Roy Kinnear]] as Dutch\n* [[Roger Ashton-Griffiths]] as Moonhead\n* [[Damien Thomas]] as Don Alfonso de Salamanca de la Torre\n* [[Olu Jacobs]] as Boomako\n* [[Ferdy Mayne]] as Captain Linares\n* [[David Kelly (actor)|David Kelly]] as Surgeon\n* Anthony Peck, [[Anthony Dawson]], Richard Dieux, and Jacques Maury as Spanish officers\n* [[Jos\u00e9 Santamar\u00eda|Jose Santamaria]] as Master at Arms\n* [[Robert Dorning]] as Commander of Marines\n* Luc Jamati as Pepito Gonzalez\n* [[Emilio Fern\u00e1ndez]] as Angelito\n* [[Wladyslaw Komar|Wladislaw Komar]] as Jesus\n\n==Production==\n===Development===\nRiding on the success of the highly acclaimed ''[[Chinatown (1974 film)|Chinatown]]'', [[Roman Polanski]] began to write a screenplay for a swashbuckling adventure film called ''Pirates'' alongside his regular collaborator, Gerard Brach.<ref>Polanski: Laughing But With an Edge By Kenneth Turan.
