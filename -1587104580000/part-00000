He is best known for his foreign policy of [[appeasement]], and in particular for his signing of the [[Munich Agreement]] on 30 September 1938, conceding the German-speaking [[Sudetenland]] region of [[Czechoslovakia]] to [[Nazi Germany|Germany]]. Following the [[German invasion of Poland]] on 1 September 1939, which marked the [[beginning of World War II]], Chamberlain announced the declaration of war on Germany two days later and led Great Britain through the [[Phoney War|first eight months]] of the war until his resignation as prime minister on 10 May 1940.\n\nAfter working in business and local government, and after a short spell as [[Director of National Service]] in 1916 and 1917, Chamberlain followed his father, [[Joseph Chamberlain]], and older half-brother, [[Austen Chamberlain]], in becoming a Member of Parliament in the [[1918 United Kingdom general election|1918 general election]] for the new [[Birmingham Ladywood (UK Parliament constituency)#Elections in the 1910s|Birmingham Ladywood]] division at the age of 49. He declined a junior ministerial position, remaining a [[backbencher]] until 1922. He was rapidly promoted in 1923 to [[Secretary of State for Health|Minister of Health]] and then [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]]. After a short-lived [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]]-led government, he returned as Minister of Health, introducing a range of reform measures from 1924 to 1929. He was appointed Chancellor of the Exchequer in the [[UK National Government|National Government]] in 1931.\n\nChamberlain succeeded [[Stanley Baldwin]] as prime minister on 28 May 1937. His premiership was dominated by the question of policy towards an increasingly aggressive Germany, and his actions at Munich were widely popular among the British at the time. In response to [[Hitler]]'s continued aggression, Chamberlain pledged Great Britain to defend Poland's independence if the latter were attacked, an alliance that brought his country into war after the German invasion of Poland. The [[Norwegian Campaign|failure of Allied forces]] to prevent the German invasion of Norway caused the House of Commons to hold the historic [[Norway Debate]] in May 1940. Chamberlain's conduct of the war was heavily criticised by members of all parties and, in a vote of confidence, his government's majority was greatly reduced. Accepting that a national government supported by all the main parties was essential, Chamberlain resigned the premiership because the Labour and [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] parties would not serve under his leadership. Although he still led the Conservative Party, he was succeeded as prime minister by his colleague [[Winston Churchill]]. Until ill health forced him to resign on 22 September 1940, Chamberlain was an important member of the [[Churchill war ministry|war cabinet]] as [[Lord President of the Council]], heading the government in Churchill's absence. Chamberlain died at 71 on 9 November 1940 of cancer, six months after leaving the premiership.\n\nChamberlain's reputation remains controversial among historians, the initial high regard for him being entirely eroded by books such as ''[[Guilty Men]]'', published in July 1940, which blamed Chamberlain and his associates for the Munich accord and for allegedly failing to prepare the country for war. Most historians in the generation following Chamberlain's death held similar views, led by Churchill in ''[[The Second World War (book series)|The Gathering Storm]]''. Some later historians have taken a more favourable perspective of Chamberlain and his policies, citing government papers released under the [[Thirty-year rule|Thirty Year Rule]] and arguing that going to war with Germany in 1938 would have been disastrous as the UK was unprepared. Nonetheless, Chamberlain is still [[Historical rankings of Prime Ministers of the United Kingdom|unfavourably ranked]] amongst British Prime Ministers.<ref>{{cite book |first=Paul |last=Strangio |title=Understanding Prime-Ministerial Performance: Comparative Perspectives |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kMu2nAZmMbEC&pg=PA226 |year=2013 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=978-0-19-966642-3 |pages=224, 226 |display-authors=etal |accessdate=14 August 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160617080346/https://books.google.com/books?id=kMu2nAZmMbEC&pg=PA226 |archive-date=17 June 2016 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Early life and political career (1869\u20131918) ==\n{{main|Rise of Neville Chamberlain}}\n\n=== Childhood and businessman ===\n[[File:Jchamberlain-achamberlain.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=Joseph Chamberlain and Austen Chamberlain, 1892|[[Joseph Chamberlain]] (seated) and [[Austen Chamberlain]], 1892]]\nChamberlain was born on 18 March 1869 in a house called Southbourne in the [[Edgbaston]] district of [[Birmingham]].{{sfn|Crozier|2004\u201309}} He was the only son of the second marriage of [[Joseph Chamberlain]], who later became [[List of Lord Mayors of Birmingham|Mayor of Birmingham]] and a Cabinet minister.

In 1906, as Governor of Birmingham's General Hospital, and along with \"no more than fifteen\" other dignitaries, Chamberlain became a founding member of the national United Hospitals Committee of the [[British Medical Association]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/44042799/|title=The United Hospitals Conference of Great Britain and Ireland|work=The Times|date=7 December 1906|page=8|accessdate=25 February 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140301111428/http://www.newspapers.com/newspage/44042799/|archive-date=1 March 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> {{sfn|Self|2006|p=31}}\n\nAt forty, Chamberlain was expecting to remain a bachelor, but in 1910 he fell in love with [[Anne Chamberlain|Anne Cole]], a recent connection by marriage, and married her the following year.{{sfn|Self|2006|pp=33\u201335}} They met through his Aunt Lilian, the Canadian-born widow of [[Joseph Chamberlain]]'s brother Herbert, who in 1907 had married Anne Cole's uncle [[Alfred Clayton Cole]], a director of the [[Bank of England]].{{sfn|Dilks|1984|pp=115\u2013116}}\n\nShe encouraged and supported his entry into local politics and was to be his constant companion, helper, and trusted colleague, fully sharing his interests in housing and other political and social activities after his election as an MP.

During the \"[[1900 United Kingdom general election|Khaki election]]\" of 1900 he made speeches in support of Joseph Chamberlain's [[Liberal Unionist Party|Liberal Unionists]]. The Liberal Unionists were allied with the Conservatives and later merged with them{{sfn|Smart|2010|p=39}} under the name \"Unionist Party\", which in 1925 became known as the \"Conservative and Unionist Party\".

The start of the [[First World War]] in 1914 prevented implementation of his plans.{{sfn|Self|2006|p=41}} In 1915, Chamberlain became [[Lord Mayor of Birmingham]].

As a Lord Mayor in wartime, Chamberlain had a huge burden of work and he insisted that his councillors and officials work equally hard.{{sfn|Self|2006|pp=42\u201343}} He halved the Lord Mayor's expense allowance and cut back on the number of civic functions expected of the incumbent.{{sfn|Smart|2010|p=62}} In 1915, Chamberlain was appointed a member of the Central Control Board on liquor traffic.<ref name=www>{{cite book|title=Who Was Who, 1929\u20131940|year=1949|publisher=A and C Black|page=235}}</ref>\n\nIn December 1916, Prime Minister [[David Lloyd George]] offered Chamberlain the new position of [[Director of National Service]], with responsibility for co-ordinating [[conscription]] and ensuring that essential war industries were able to function with sufficient workforces.{{sfn|Smart|2010|p=67}} His tenure was marked by conflict with Lloyd George; in August 1917, having received little support from the Prime Minister, Chamberlain resigned.{{sfn|Smart|2010|pp=77\u201379}} The relationship between Chamberlain and Lloyd George would, thereafter, be one of mutual hatred.{{sfn|Smart|2010|p=70}}\n\nChamberlain decided to stand for the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]],{{sfn|Self|2006|p=68}} and was adopted as Unionist candidate for [[Birmingham Ladywood (UK Parliament constituency)|Birmingham Ladywood]].{{sfn|Dilks|1984|p=262}} After the war ended, [[1918 United Kingdom general election|a general election]] was called almost immediately.{{sfn|Dilks|1984|p=262}} The campaign in this constituency was notable because his Liberal Party opponent was [[Margery Corbett Ashby|Mrs Margery Corbett Ashby]], one of the seventeen women candidates who stood for Parliament at the first election at which women were eligible to do so. Chamberlain reacted to this intervention by being one of the few male candidates to specifically target women voters deploying his wife, issuing a special leaflet headed \"A word to the Ladies\" and holding two meetings in the afternoon.<ref>[http://www.brewinbooks.com/taking_on_the_men Hallam, David J.A.

When Law resigned as party leader, Austen Chamberlain took his place as head of the Unionists in Parliament.{{sfn|Smart|2010|pp=94\u201395}} Unionist leaders were willing to fight the [[1922 United Kingdom general election|1922 election]] in coalition with the Lloyd George Liberals, but on 19 October, Unionist MPs held [[Carlton Club meeting, 19 October 1922|a meeting]] at which they voted to fight the election as a single party. Lloyd George resigned, as did Austen Chamberlain, and Law was recalled from retirement to lead the Unionists as Prime Minister.{{sfn|Smart|2010|p=96}}\n\nMany high-ranking Unionists refused to serve under Law to the benefit of Chamberlain, who rose over the course of ten months from backbencher to Chancellor of the Exchequer.{{sfn|Self|2006|p=87}} Law initially appointed Chamberlain [[Postmaster General of the United Kingdom|Postmaster General]]{{sfn|Self|2006|pp=87\u201388}} and Chamberlain was sworn of the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]].<ref name=kellys>{{cite book|title=Kelly's Handbook to the Titled, Landed and Official Classes 1940|publisher=Kelly's|page=433}}</ref> When Sir [[Arthur Griffith-Boscawen]], the Minister of Health, lost his seat in the 1922 election and was defeated in a by-election in March 1923 by future [[Home Secretary]] [[James Chuter Ede]], Law offered the position to Chamberlain.{{sfn|Self|2006|p=89}} Two months later, Law was diagnosed with advanced, terminal [[throat cancer]]. He immediately resigned and was replaced by Chancellor of the Exchequer [[Stanley Baldwin]]. In August 1923, Baldwin promoted Chamberlain to the position of Chancellor of the Exchequer.{{sfn|Smart|2010|pp=106\u201307}}\n\nChamberlain served only five months in the office before the Conservatives were defeated in the [[1923 United Kingdom general election|1923 general election]]. [[Ramsay MacDonald]] became the first Labour Prime Minister, but his government fell within months, necessitating [[1924 United Kingdom general election|another general election]]. By a margin of only 77 votes, Chamberlain narrowly defeated the Labour candidate, [[Oswald Mosley]], who later led the [[British Union of Fascists]].{{sfn|Macklin|2006|pp=24\u201325}} Believing he would lose if he stood again in Birmingham Ladywood, Chamberlain arranged to be adopted for [[Birmingham Edgbaston (UK Parliament constituency)|Birmingham Edgbaston]], the district of the city where he was born and which was a much safer seat, which he would hold for the rest of his life.{{sfn|Self|2006|p=103}} The Unionists won the election, but Chamberlain declined to serve again as Chancellor, preferring his former position as Minister of Health.{{sfn|Dutton|2001|p=14}}\n\nWithin two weeks of his appointment as Minister of Health, Chamberlain presented the Cabinet with an agenda containing 25 pieces of legislation he hoped to see enacted. Before he left office in 1929, 21 of the 25 bills had passed into law.{{sfn|Self|2006|p=106}} Chamberlain sought the abolition of the elected [[Poor Law]] [[Boards of Guardians]] which administered relief\u2014and which in some areas were responsible for [[rates (tax)|rates]]. Many of the Boards were controlled by Labour, and such Boards had defied the government by distributing relief funds to the able-bodied unemployed.{{sfn|Self|2006|pp=116\u201318}} In 1929, Chamberlain initiated the [[Local Government Act 1929]] to abolish the Poor Law boards entirely. Chamberlain spoke in the Commons for two and a half hours on the [[second reading]] of the Bill, and when he concluded he was applauded by all parties. The Bill passed into law.{{sfn|Smart|2010|pp=139\u201340}}\n\nThough Chamberlain struck a conciliatory note during the [[UK General Strike of 1926|1926 General Strike]], in general he had poor relations with the Labour opposition. Future Labour Prime Minister [[Clement Attlee]] complained that Chamberlain \"always treated us like dirt,\" and in April 1927 Chamberlain wrote: \"More and more do I feel an utter contempt for their lamentable ''stupidity''.\"{{sfn|Self|2006|p=115}} His poor relations with the Labour Party later played a major part in his downfall as Prime Minister.{{sfn|Self|2006|p=429}}\n\n=== Opposition and second term as Chancellor ===\nBaldwin called [[1929 United Kingdom general election|a general election]] for 30 May 1929, resulting in a [[hung parliament]] with Labour holding the most seats. Baldwin and his government resigned and Labour, under MacDonald, again took office.{{sfn|Dilks|1984|pp=584\u201386}} In 1931, the MacDonald government faced a serious crisis as the [[May Report]] revealed that the budget was unbalanced, with an expected shortfall of \u00a3120&nbsp;million.

Joseph Chamberlain had advocated a similar policy, \"[[Imperial Preference]]\";{{sfn|Self|2006|p=163}} Neville Chamberlain laid his bill before the House of Commons on 4 February 1932,{{sfn|Self|2006|pp=165\u201366}} and concluded his address by noting the appropriateness of his seeking to enact his father's proposal. At the end of the speech, Sir Austen Chamberlain walked down from the backbenches and shook his brother's hand.{{sfn|Dutton|2001|p=17}} The [[Import Duties Act 1932]] passed Parliament easily.{{sfn|Smart|2010|p=173}}\n\nChamberlain presented his first budget in April 1932. He maintained the severe budget cuts that had been agreed at the inception of the National Government.{{sfn|Macklin|2006|p=32}} Interest on the war debt was a major cost. Chamberlain reduced the annual interest rate on [[War bond#United Kingdom|most of Britain's war debt]] from 5% to 3.5%. Between 1932 and 1938, Chamberlain halved the percentage of the budget devoted to interest on the war debt.{{sfn|Smart|2010|p=174}}\n\n====War debt====\nChamberlain hoped that a cancellation of the war debt owed to the United States could be negotiated. In June 1933, Britain hosted the [[London Economic Conference|World Monetary and Economic Conference]], which came to nothing as US President [[Franklin D.

During the campaign, deputy Labour leader [[Arthur Greenwood]] had attacked Chamberlain for spending money on rearmament, saying that the rearmament policy was \"the merest scaremongering; disgraceful in a statesman of Mr Chamberlain's responsible position, to suggest that more millions of money needed to be spent on armaments.\"{{sfn|Dutton|2001|p=40}}\n\n====Role in the abdication crisis====\nChamberlain is believed to have had a significant role in the 1936 [[Edward VIII abdication crisis|abdication crisis]].

At 68 he was the second-oldest person in the 20th century (behind Sir [[Henry Campbell-Bannerman]]) to become Prime Minister for the first time,{{sfn|Self|2006|p=261}} and was widely seen as a caretaker who would lead the Conservative Party until the next election and then step down in favour of a younger man, with Foreign Secretary [[Anthony Eden]] a likely candidate. From the start of Chamberlain's premiership a number of would-be successors were rumoured to be jockeying for position.{{sfn|Smart|2010|pp=224\u201325}}\n\nChamberlain had disliked what he considered to be the overly sentimental attitude of both Baldwin and MacDonald on Cabinet appointments and reshuffles. Although he had worked closely with the [[President of the Board of Trade]], [[Walter Runciman, 1st Viscount Runciman of Doxford|Walter Runciman]], on the tariff issue, Chamberlain dismissed him from his post, instead offering him the token position of [[Lord Privy Seal]], which an angry Runciman declined. Chamberlain thought Runciman, a member of the [[Liberal National Party (UK, 1931)|Liberal National Party]], to be lazy.{{sfn|Self|2006|p=261}} Soon after taking office Chamberlain instructed his ministers to prepare two-year policy programmes. These reports were to be integrated with the intent of co-ordinating the passage of legislation through the current Parliament, the term of which was to expire in November 1940.{{sfn|Self|2006|p=264}}\n\nAt the time of his succession Chamberlain's personality was not well known to the public, though he had made annual budget broadcasts for six years. According to Chamberlain biographer Robert Self, these appeared relaxed and modern, showing an ability to speak directly to the camera.{{sfn|Self|2006|p=261}} Chamberlain had few friends among his parliamentary colleagues; an attempt by his [[Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Prime Minister|Parliamentary Private Secretary]], Lord Dunglass (later Prime Minister himself as [[Alec Douglas-Home]]), to bring him to the Commons Smoking Room to socialise with colleagues ended in embarrassing silence.{{sfn|Faber|2008|p=171}} Chamberlain compensated for these shortcomings by devising the most sophisticated [[spin doctor|press management system]] employed by a Prime Minister up to that time, with officials at [[10 Downing Street|Number 10]], led by his chief of press George Steward, convincing members of the press that they were colleagues sharing power and insider knowledge, and should espouse the government line.{{sfn|Faber|2008|p=172}}\n\n=== Domestic policy ===\n[[File:INF3-46 Neville Chamberlain Artist Wooding.jpg|thumb|right|Caricature of Chamberlain, {{circa|1940}}]]\nChamberlain saw his elevation to the premiership as the final glory in a career as a domestic reformer, not realising that he would be remembered for foreign policy decisions.{{sfn|Macklin|2006|p=48}} One reason he sought the settlement of European issues was the hope it would allow him to concentrate on domestic affairs.{{sfn|Macklin|2006|p=52}}\n\nSoon after attaining the premiership, Chamberlain obtained passage of the [[Factories Act 1937]]. This Act was aimed at bettering working conditions in factories, and placed limits on the working hours of women and children.{{sfn|Macklin|2006|p=158}} In 1938, Parliament enacted the [[Coal Act 1938]], which allowed for nationalisation of coal deposits. Another major law passed that year was the [[Holidays with Pay Act 1938]].{{sfn|Macklin|2006|p=158}} Though the Act only recommended that employers give workers a week off with pay, it led to a great expansion of [[holiday camp]]s and other leisure accommodation for the working classes.{{sfn|Dawson|2006}} The Housing Act 1938 provided subsidies aimed at encouraging [[slum clearance]] and maintained [[rent control]].{{sfn|Macklin|2006|p=158}} Chamberlain's plans for the reform of local government were shelved because of the outbreak of war in 1939. Likewise, the raising of the school-leaving age to 15, scheduled for implementation on 1 September 1939, did not go into effect.{{sfn|Taylor|1965|p=406}}\n\n=== Relations with Ireland ===\nRelations between the United Kingdom and the [[Irish Free State]] had been strained since the 1932 appointment of [[\u00c9amon de Valera]] as [[President of the Executive Council of the Irish Free State|President of the Executive Council]]. The [[Anglo-Irish Trade War]], sparked by the withholding of money that Ireland had agreed to pay the United Kingdom, had caused economic losses on both sides, and the two nations were anxious for a settlement. The de Valera government also sought to sever the remaining ties between Ireland and the UK, such as ending the King's status as Irish Head of State. As Chancellor, Chamberlain had taken a hard-line stance against concessions to the Irish, but as premier sought a settlement with Ireland, being persuaded that the strained ties were affecting relations with other Dominions.{{sfn|Self|2006|pp=298\u201399}}\n\nTalks had been suspended under Baldwin in 1936 but resumed in November 1937. De Valera sought not only to alter the constitutional status of Ireland, but to overturn other aspects of the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]], most notably the issue of [[Partition of Ireland|partition]], as well as obtaining full control of the three \"[[Treaty Ports (Ireland)|Treaty Ports]]\" which had remained in British control. Britain, on the other hand, wished to retain the Treaty Ports, at least in time of war, and to obtain the money that Ireland had agreed to pay.{{sfn|Self|2006|pp=298\u201399}}\n\nThe Irish proved very tough negotiators, so much so that Chamberlain complained that one of de Valera's offers had \"presented United Kingdom ministers with a three-leafed shamrock, none of the leaves of which had any advantages for the UK.\"{{sfn|Self|2006|pp=298\u201399}} With the talks facing deadlock, Chamberlain made the Irish a final offer in March 1938 which acceded to many Irish positions, though he was confident that he had \"only given up the small things,\" and the agreements were signed on 25 April 1938.{{sfn|Self|2006|pp=298\u201399}} The issue of partition was not resolved, but the Irish agreed to pay \u00a310&nbsp;million to the British. There was no provision in the treaties for British access to the Treaty Ports in time of war, but Chamberlain accepted de Valera's oral assurance that in the event of war the British would have access.{{sfn|Self|2006|pp=298\u201399}} Conservative backbencher [[Winston Churchill]] attacked the agreements in Parliament for surrendering the Treaty Ports, which he described as the \"sentinel towers of the Western Approaches\".{{sfn|Self|2006|pp=298\u201399}} When war came, de Valera denied Britain access to the Treaty Ports under [[Irish neutrality]].{{sfn|Self|2006|pp=298\u201399}} Churchill railed against these treaties in ''[[The Second World War (book series)|The Gathering Storm]]'', stating that he \"never saw the House of Commons more completely misled\" and that \"members were made to feel very differently about it when our existence hung in the balance during the [[Battle of the Atlantic]].\"{{sfn|Macklin|2006|p=64}} Chamberlain believed that the Treaty Ports were unusable if Ireland was hostile, and deemed their loss worthwhile to assure friendly relations with Dublin.{{sfn|Taylor|1965|p=406}}\n\n=== European policy ===\n{{main|European foreign policy of the Chamberlain ministry}}\n\n==== Early days (May 1937 \u2013 March 1938) ====\nChamberlain sought to conciliate Germany and make the Nazi state a partner in a stable Europe.{{sfn|Smart|2010|p=225}} He believed Germany could be satisfied by the restoration of some of her colonies, and during the [[Remilitarization of the Rhineland|Rhineland crisis]] of March 1936 he had stated that \"if we were in sight of an all-round settlement the British government ought to consider the question\" of restoration of colonies.{{sfn|Self|2006|p=279}}\n\nThe new Prime Minister's attempts to secure such a settlement were frustrated because Germany was in no hurry to talk to Britain. Foreign Minister [[Konstantin von Neurath]] was supposed to visit Britain in July 1937 but cancelled his visit.{{sfn|Smart|2010|p=225}} [[E. F. L. Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax|Lord Halifax]], the [[Lord President of the Council]], visited Germany privately in November and met Hitler and other German officials. Both Chamberlain and British Ambassador to Germany [[Nevile Henderson]] pronounced the visit a success.{{sfn|Smart|2010|p=226}} Foreign Office officials complained that the Halifax visit made it appear Britain was too eager for talks, and the Foreign Secretary, [[Anthony Eden]], felt that he had been bypassed.{{sfn|Smart|2010|pp=225\u201326}}\n\nChamberlain also bypassed Eden while the Foreign Secretary was on holiday by opening direct talks with Italy, an international pariah for its [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War|invasion and conquest]] of [[Ethiopia]].{{sfn|Self|2006|pp=273\u201374}} At a Cabinet meeting on 8 September 1937, Chamberlain indicated that he saw \"the lessening of the tension between this country and Italy as a very valuable contribution toward the pacification and appeasement of Europe\" which would \"weaken the [[Axis powers|Rome\u2013Berlin axis]].\"{{sfn|Self|2006|p=274}} The Prime Minister also set up a private line of communication with the Italian \"Duce\" [[Benito Mussolini]] through the Italian Ambassador, Count [[Dino Grandi]].{{sfn|Smart|2010|pp=228\u201329}}\n\nIn February 1938, Hitler began to press the Austrian government to accept \"[[Anschluss|Anschlu\u00df]],\" or union between Germany and Austria. Chamberlain believed that it was essential to cement relations with Italy in the hope that an Anglo\u2013Italian alliance would forestall Hitler from imposing his rule over Austria. Eden believed that Chamberlain was being too hasty in talking with Italy and holding out the prospect of ''[[de jure]]'' recognition of Italy's conquest of Ethiopia. Chamberlain concluded that Eden would have to accept his policy or resign.{{sfn|Smart|2010|pp=230\u201332}} The Cabinet heard both men out but unanimously decided for Chamberlain, and despite efforts by other Cabinet members to prevent it, Eden resigned from office.{{sfn|Self|2006|p=286}} In later years, Eden tried to portray his resignation as a stand against appeasement (Churchill described him in ''[[The Second World War (book series)|The Second World War]]'' as \"one strong young figure standing up against long, dismal, drawling tides of drift and surrender\"){{sfn|Faber|2008|p=103}} but many ministers{{sfn|Self|2006|p=286}} and MPs believed there was no issue at stake worth resignation.{{sfn|Smart|2010|p=232}} Chamberlain appointed Lord Halifax as Foreign Secretary in Eden's place.{{sfn|Smart|2010|p=232}}\n\n==== Road to Munich (March 1938 \u2013 September 1938) ====\nIn March 1938 Austria became a part of Germany in the \"Anschlu\u00df\". Though the beleaguered Austrians requested help from Britain, none was forthcoming.{{sfn|Self|2006|p=304}} Britain did send Berlin a strong note of protest.{{sfn|Faber|2008|p=148}} In addressing the Cabinet shortly after German forces crossed the border, Chamberlain placed blame on both Germany and Austria.{{sfn|Self|2006|p=304}} Chamberlain noted,\n\n{{quote\n| It is perfectly evident now that force is the only argument Germany understands and that \"collective security\" cannot offer any prospect of preventing such events until it can show a visible force of overwhelming strength backed by the determination to use it.&nbsp;... Heaven knows I don't want to get back to alliances but if Germany continues to behave as she has done lately she may drive us to it.{{sfn|Self|2006|p=304}}\n}}\n\nOn 14 March, the day after the \"Anschlu\u00df,\" Chamberlain addressed the House of Commons and strongly condemned the methods used by the Germans in the takeover of Austria. Chamberlain's address met with the approval of the House.{{sfn|Faber|2008|p=148}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-H12967, M\u00fcnchener Abkommen, Chamberlain.jpg|thumb|left|Chamberlain arrives in Munich, September 1938]]\nWith Austria absorbed by Germany, attention turned to Hitler's obvious next target, the [[Sudetenland]] region of Czechoslovakia. With three million ethnic Germans, the Sudetenland represented the largest German population outside the \"Reich\"{{sfn|Self|2006|p=302}} and Hitler began to call for the union of the region with Germany.{{sfn|Faber|2008|p=156}} Britain had no military obligations toward Czechoslovakia,{{sfn|Smart|2010|p=237}} but France and Czechoslovakia had a mutual assistance pact{{sfn|Self|2006|p=304}} and both the French and Czechoslovaks also had an alliance with the Soviet Union. After the fall of Austria, the Cabinet's Foreign Policy Committee considered seeking a \"grand alliance\" to thwart Germany or, alternatively, an assurance to France of assistance if the French went to war. Instead, the committee chose to advocate that Czechoslovakia be urged to make the best terms it could with Germany.{{sfn|Faber|2008|pp=159\u201360}} The full Cabinet agreed with the committee's recommendation, influenced by a report from the chiefs of staff stating that there was little that Britain could do to help the Czechs in the event of a German invasion.{{sfn|Faber|2008|pp=159\u201360}} Chamberlain reported to an amenable House that he was unwilling to limit his government's discretion by giving commitments.{{sfn|Faber|2008|p=160}}\n\nBritain and Italy signed an agreement in April 1938. In exchange for ''[[de jure]]'' recognition of Italy's Ethiopian conquest, Italy agreed to withdraw some Italian \"volunteers\" from the Nationalist (pro-[[Francisco Franco|Franco]]) side of the [[Spanish Civil War]]. By this point, the Nationalists strongly had the upper hand in that conflict, and they completed their victory the following year.{{sfn|Smart|2010|p=234}} Later that month, the new French Prime Minister, [[\u00c9douard Daladier]], came to London for talks with Chamberlain, and agreed to follow the British position on Czechoslovakia.{{sfn|Faber|2008|p=162}}\n\nIn May, Czech border guards shot two Sudeten German farmers who were trying to cross the border from Germany into Czechoslovakia without stopping for border controls. This incident caused unrest among the Sudeten Germans, and Germany was then said to be moving troops to the border. In response to the report, Prague moved troops to the German border. Halifax sent a note to Germany warning that if France intervened in the crisis on Czechoslovakia's behalf, Britain might support France. Tensions appeared to calm, and Chamberlain and Halifax were applauded for their \"masterly\" handling of the crisis.{{sfn|Self|2006|p=304}} Though it was not known at the time, it later became clear that Germany had had no plans for a May invasion of Czechoslovakia.{{sfn|Self|2006|p=304}} Nonetheless, the Chamberlain government received strong and almost unanimous support from the British press.{{sfn|Faber|2008|p=189}}\n\nNegotiations between the Czech government and the Sudeten Germans dragged on through mid-1938.{{sfn|Faber|2008|pp=202\u201303}} They achieved little result; Sudeten leader [[Konrad Henlein]] was under private instructions from Hitler not to reach an agreement. On 3 August, Walter Runciman (by now Lord Runciman) travelled to Prague as a [[Runciman Mission|mediator]] sent by the British government.{{sfn|Faber|2008|pp=199\u2013200}} Over the next two weeks, Runciman met separately with Henlein, Czechoslovak President [[Edvard Bene\u0161]], and other leaders, but made no progress.{{sfn|Faber|2008|pp=211\u201314}} On 30 August. Chamberlain met his Cabinet and Ambassador Henderson and secured their backing\u2014with only [[First Lord of the Admiralty]] [[Duff Cooper]] dissenting against Chamberlain's policy to pressure Czechoslovakia into making concessions, on the ground that Britain was then in no position to back up any threat to go to war.{{sfn|Faber|2008|pp=230\u201334}}\n\nChamberlain realised that Hitler would likely signal his intentions in his 12 September speech at the annual [[Nuremberg Rally]], and so the Prime Minister discussed with his advisors how to respond if war seemed likely. In consultation with his close advisor Sir [[Horace Wilson (civil servant)|Horace Wilson]], Chamberlain set out \"Plan Z\". If war seemed inevitable, Chamberlain would fly to Germany to negotiate directly with Hitler.{{sfn|Self|2006|p=308}}\n\n==== September 1938: Munich ====\n\n==== Preliminary meetings ====\nLord Runciman continued his work, attempting to pressure the Czechoslovak government into concessions. On 7 September there was an altercation involving Sudeten members of the Czechoslovak parliament in the North Moravian city of [[Ostrava]] (''M\u00e4hrisch-Ostrau'' in German). The Germans made considerable propaganda out of the incident, though the Prague government tried to conciliate them by dismissing Czech police who had been involved. As the tempest grew, Runciman concluded that there was no point in attempting further negotiations until after Hitler's speech. The mission never resumed.{{sfn|Faber|2008|pp=244\u201346}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-H12486, Vorbereitung M\u00fcnchener Abkommen, Chamberlain auf dem Flugplatz Oberwiesenfeld.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|alt=British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain and German Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop, 1938|Chamberlain (centre, hat and umbrella in hands) walks with German Foreign Minister [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]] (right) as the Prime Minister leaves for home after the Berchtesgaden meeting, 16 September 1938.

Thousands gathered outside 10 Downing Street on the night of the speech. At last Hitler addressed his wildly enthusiastic followers:\n\n{{quote\n| The condition of the Sudeten Germans is indescribable. It is sought to annihilate them. As human beings they are oppressed and scandalously treated in an intolerable fashion&nbsp;... The depriving of these people of their rights must come to an end.&nbsp;... I have stated that the \"Reich\" would not tolerate any further oppression of these three and a half million Germans, and I would ask the statesmen of foreign countries to be convinced that this is no mere form of words.{{sfn|Faber|2008|pp=263\u201366}}\n}}\n\nThe following morning, 13 September, Chamberlain and the Cabinet were informed by Secret Service sources that all German embassies had been told that Germany would invade Czechoslovakia on 25 September.{{sfn|Faber|2008|p=277}} Convinced that the French would not fight (Daladier was privately proposing a three-Power summit to settle the Sudeten question), Chamberlain decided to implement \"Plan Z\" and sent a message to Hitler that he was willing to come to Germany to negotiate. Hitler accepted and Chamberlain flew to Germany on the morning of 15 September; this was the first time, excepting a short jaunt at an industrial fair, that Chamberlain had ever flown. Chamberlain flew to Munich and then travelled by rail to Hitler's retreat at [[Berchtesgaden]].{{sfn|Self|2006|pp=310\u201312}}\n\nThe face to face meeting lasted about three hours. Hitler demanded the annexation of the Sudetenland, and through questioning him, Chamberlain was able to obtain assurances that Hitler had no designs on the remainder of Czechoslovakia or on the areas in Eastern Europe which had German minorities. After the meeting Chamberlain returned to London, believing that he had obtained a breathing space during which agreement could be reached and the peace preserved.{{sfn|Self|2006|pp=312\u201314}} Under the proposals made at Berchtesgaden the Sudetenland would be annexed by Germany if a plebiscite in the Sudetenland favoured it. Czechoslovakia would receive international guarantees of its independence which would replace existing treaty obligations\u2014principally the French pledge to the Czechoslovaks.{{sfn|Smart|2010|p=242}} The French agreed to the requirements. Under considerable pressure the Czechoslovaks also agreed, causing the Czechoslovak government to fall.{{sfn|Faber|2008|pp=319\u201324}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-H12751, Godesberg, Vorbereitung M\u00fcnchener Abkommen.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|alt=Chamberlain and Hitler leave the Bad Godesberg meeting, 1938|Chamberlain (left) and Hitler leave the Bad Godesberg meeting, 23 September 1938.]]\n\nChamberlain flew back to Germany, meeting Hitler in [[Bad Godesberg]] on 22 September.{{sfn|Self|2006|p=316}} Hitler brushed aside the proposals of the previous meeting, saying \"that won't do any more\".{{sfn|Self|2006|p=316}} Hitler demanded immediate occupation of the Sudetenland and that Polish and Hungarian territorial claims on Czechoslovakia be addressed. Chamberlain objected strenuously, telling Hitler that he had worked to bring the French and Czechoslovaks into line with Germany's demands, so much so that he had been accused of giving in to dictators and had been booed on his departure that morning. Hitler was unmoved.{{sfn|Self|2006|p=316}}\n\nThat evening, Chamberlain told Lord Halifax that the \"meeting with Herr Hitler had been most unsatisfactory\".{{sfn|Faber|2008|p=334}} The following day, Hitler kept Chamberlain waiting until mid-afternoon, when he sent a five-page letter, in German, outlining the demands he had made orally the previous day. Chamberlain replied by offering to act as an intermediary with the Czechoslovaks, and suggested that Hitler put his demands in a memorandum which could be circulated to the French and Czechoslovaks.{{sfn|Faber|2008|p=337}}\n\nThe leaders met again late on the evening of 23 September\u2014a meeting which stretched into the early morning hours. Hitler demanded that fleeing Czechs in the zones to be occupied take nothing with them. He extended his deadline for occupation of the Sudetenland to 1 October\u2014the date he had long before secretly set for the invasion of Czechoslovakia. The meeting ended amicably, with Chamberlain confiding to Hitler his hopes they would be able to work out other problems in Europe in the same spirit. Hitler hinted that the Sudetenland fulfilled his territorial ambitions in Europe. Chamberlain flew back to London, saying \"It is up to the Czechs now.\"{{sfn|Faber|2008|pp=340\u201342}}\n\n==== Munich conference ====\nHitler's proposals met with resistance not only from the French and Czechoslovaks, but also from some members of Chamberlain's cabinet. With no agreement in sight, war seemed inevitable.{{sfn|Self|2006|pp=318\u201320}} The Prime Minister issued a press statement calling on Germany to abandon the threat of force in exchange for British help in obtaining the concessions it sought.{{sfn|Self|2006|p=321}} On the evening of 27 September, Chamberlain addressed the nation by radio, and after thanking those who wrote to him, stated:\n\n{{quote\n| How horrible, fantastic, incredible it is that we should be digging trenches and trying on gas-masks here because of a quarrel in a far-away country between people of whom we know nothing. It seems still more impossible that a quarrel that has already been settled in principle should be the subject of war.{{sfn|Faber|2008|pp=375\u201376}}\n}}\n\nOn 28 September, Chamberlain called on Hitler to invite him to Germany again to seek a solution through a summit involving the British, French, Germans, and Italians.{{sfn|Faber|2008|p=382}} Hitler replied favourably, and word of this response came to Chamberlain as he was winding up a speech in [[1935 United Kingdom general election|the House of Commons]] which sat in gloomy anticipation of war. Chamberlain informed the House of this in his speech.{{sfn|Self|2006|p=323}} The response was a passionate demonstration, with members cheering Chamberlain wildly. Even diplomats in the galleries applauded. Lord Dunglass later commented, \"There were a lot of appeasers in Parliament that day.\"{{sfn|Self|2006|p=323}}\n\nOn the morning of 29 September Chamberlain left [[Heston Aerodrome]] (to the east of today's [[Heathrow Airport]]) for his third and final visit to Germany.{{sfn|Self|2006|p=324}} On arrival in Munich the British delegation was taken directly to the [[Hochschule f\u00fcr Musik und Theater M\u00fcnchen|''F\u00fchrerbau'']], where Daladier, [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini]], and Hitler soon arrived. The four leaders and their translators held an informal meeting; Hitler said that he intended to invade Czechoslovakia on 1 October. Mussolini distributed a proposal similar to Hitler's Bad Godesberg terms. In reality, the proposal had been drafted by German officials and transmitted to Rome the previous day. The four leaders debated the draft and Chamberlain raised the question of compensation for the Czechoslovak government and citizens, but Hitler refused to consider this.{{sfn|Faber|2008|pp=403\u201307}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-R69173, M\u00fcnchener Abkommen, Staatschefs.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|left|alt=Chamberlain, Daladier, Hitler, Mussolini, and Italian Foreign Minister Count Ciano as they prepared to sign the Munich Agreement|From left to right, Chamberlain, Daladier, Hitler, Mussolini and Italian Foreign Minister Count [[Galeazzo Ciano]] as they prepare to sign the [[Munich Agreement]]]]\n\nThe leaders were joined by advisors after lunch, and hours were spent on long discussions of each clause of the \"Italian\" draft agreement. Late that evening the British and French left for their hotels, saying that they had to seek advice from their respective capitals. Meanwhile, the Germans and Italians enjoyed the feast which Hitler had intended for all the participants. During this break, Chamberlain advisor [[Horace Wilson (civil servant)|Sir Horace Wilson]] met with the Czechoslovaks; he informed them of the draft agreement and asked which districts were particularly important to them.{{sfn|Faber|2008|pp=407\u201310}} The conference resumed at about 10&nbsp;pm and was mostly in the hands of a small drafting committee. At 1:30&nbsp;am the [[Munich Agreement]] was ready for signing, though the signing ceremony was delayed when Hitler discovered that the ornate inkwell on his desk was empty.{{sfn|Faber|2008|pp=410\u201311}}\n\nChamberlain and Daladier returned to their hotel and informed the Czechoslovaks of the agreement. The two Prime Ministers urged quick acceptance by the Czechoslovaks of the agreement, since the evacuation by the Czechs was to begin the following day. At 12:30&nbsp;pm the Czechoslovak government in Prague objected to the decision but agreed to its terms.{{sfn|Faber|2008|pp=413\u201314}}\n\n==== Aftermath and reception ====\n[[File:MunichAgreement.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|alt=A large crowd on an airfield; British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain presents an assurance from German Chancellor Adolf Hitler.|Neville Chamberlain holds the paper signed by both Hitler and himself on his return from [[Munich]] to [[Heston Aerodrome]].]]\n{{listen\n| filename = Another talk with the German Chancellor, Herr Hitler.ogg\n| title = Chamberlain's return to Britain after Munich\n| description = Neville Chamberlain speaks to the crowd upon arrival at Heston Aerodrome, 30 September 1938.\n}}\n\nBefore leaving the \"''F\u00fchrerbau'',\" Chamberlain requested a private conference with Hitler. Hitler agreed, and the two met at Hitler's apartment in the city later that morning. Chamberlain urged restraint in the implementation of the agreement and requested that the Germans not bomb Prague if the Czechs resisted, to which Hitler seemed agreeable. Chamberlain took from his pocket a paper headed \"Anglo\u2013German Agreement,\" which contained three paragraphs, including a statement that the two nations considered the Munich Agreement \"symbolic of the desire of our two peoples never to go to war again.\" According to Chamberlain, Hitler interjected \"''Ja! Ja!''\" (\"Yes! Yes!\") as the Prime Minister read it.{{sfn|Self|2006|pp=324\u201325}} The two men signed the paper then and there. When, later that day, German Foreign Minister [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]] remonstrated with Hitler for signing it, the F\u00fchrer replied, \"Oh, don't take it so seriously. That piece of paper is of no further significance whatever.\"{{sfn|Faber|2008|p=417}} Chamberlain, on the other hand, patted his breast pocket when he returned to his hotel for lunch and said, \"I've got it!\"{{sfn|Self|2006|p=325}} Word leaked of the outcome of the meetings before Chamberlain's return, causing delight among many in London but gloom for Churchill and his supporters.{{sfn|Faber|2008|pp=417\u201318}}\n\nChamberlain returned to London in triumph. Large crowds mobbed Heston, where he was met by the [[Lord Chamberlain]], [[George Villiers, 6th Earl of Clarendon|the Earl of Clarendon]], who gave him a letter from [[George VI|King George VI]] assuring him of the Empire's lasting gratitude and urging him to come straight to Buckingham Palace to report.{{sfn|Faber|2008|p=5}} The streets were so packed with cheering people that it took Chamberlain an hour and a half to journey the nine miles (14&nbsp;km) from Heston to the Palace. After reporting to the King, Chamberlain and his wife appeared on the Palace balcony with the King and [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother|Queen]]. He then went to Downing Street; both the street and the front hall of Number 10 were packed.{{sfn|Faber|2008|pp=5\u20137}} As he headed upstairs to address the crowd from a first-floor window, someone called to him, \"Neville, go up to the window and say 'peace for our time'.\"{{efn|name=Peace in our time}} Chamberlain turned around and responded, \"No, I don't do that sort of thing.\"{{sfn|Faber|2008|pp=5\u20137}} Nevertheless, in his statement to the crowd, Chamberlain recalled the words of his predecessor, [[Benjamin Disraeli]], upon the latter's return from the [[Congress of Berlin]]:{{efn|name=Disraeli peace}}\n\n{{quote\n| My good friends, this is the second time there has come back from Germany to Downing Street peace with honour.

Though Cooper opened by setting forth the reasons for his resignation{{sfn|Self|2006|p=330}} and Churchill spoke harshly against the pact, no Conservative voted against the government. Only between 20 and 30 abstained, including Churchill, Eden, Cooper, and [[Harold Macmillan]].{{sfn|Faber|2008|pp=424\u201325}}\n\n=== Path to war (October 1938 \u2013 August 1939) ===\nIn the aftermath of Munich, Chamberlain continued to pursue a course of cautious rearmament. He told the Cabinet in early October 1938, \"<nowiki>[I]</nowiki>t would be madness for the country to stop rearming until we were convinced that other countries would act in the same way. For the time being, therefore, we should relax no particle of effort until our deficiencies had been made good.\"{{sfn|Self|2006|p=333}} Later in October, he resisted calls to put industry on a war footing, convinced that such an action would show Hitler that the Prime Minister had decided to abandon Munich.{{sfn|Self|2006|p=333}} Chamberlain hoped that the understanding he had signed with Hitler at Munich would lead toward a general settlement of European disputes, but Hitler expressed no public interest in following up on the accord.{{sfn|Smart|2010|p=249}} Having considered a general election immediately following Munich,{{sfn|Self|2006|pp=334\u201335}} Chamberlain instead [[Cabinet shuffle|reshuffled his Cabinet]].{{sfn|Smart|2010|p=250}} By the end of the year, public concerns caused Chamberlain to conclude that \"to get rid of this uneasy and disgruntled House of Commons by a General Election\" would be \"suicidal\".{{sfn|Self|2006|p=341}}\n\nDespite Hitler's relative quietness as the \"Reich\" absorbed the Sudetenland, foreign policy concerns continued to preoccupy Chamberlain. He made trips to Paris and Rome, hoping to persuade the French to hasten their rearmament and Mussolini to be a positive influence on Hitler.{{sfn|Smart|2010|pp=250\u201351}} Several of his Cabinet members, led by Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax, began to draw away from the appeasement policy. Halifax was by now convinced that Munich, though \"better than a European war,\" had been \"a horrid business and humiliating\".{{sfn|Self|2006|p=339}} Public revulsion over the pogrom of ''[[Kristallnacht]]'' on 9 November 1938 made any attempt at a \"rapprochement\" with Hitler unacceptable, though Chamberlain did not abandon his hopes.{{sfn|Self|2006|pp=344\u201345}}\n\nStill hoping for reconciliation with Germany, Chamberlain made a major speech in Birmingham on 28 January 1939, in which he expressed his desire for international peace, and had an advance copy sent to Hitler at Berchtesgaden. Hitler seemed to respond; in his \"[[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]]\" speech on 30 January 1939, he stated that he wanted a \"long peace\".{{sfn|Self|2006|pp=345\u201346}} Chamberlain was confident that improvements in British defence since Munich would bring the dictator to the bargaining table.{{sfn|Self|2006|pp=345\u201346}} This belief was reinforced by a German official's conciliatory speech welcoming Ambassador Henderson back to Berlin after an absence for medical treatment in Britain. Chamberlain responded with a speech in [[Blackburn]] on 22 February hoping that the nations would resolve their differences through trade, and was gratified when his comments were printed in German newspapers.{{sfn|Self|2006|p=347}} With matters appearing to improve, Chamberlain's rule over the House of Commons was firm and he was convinced the government would \"romp home\" in a late 1939 election.{{sfn|Self|2006|p=348}}\n\nOn 15 March 1939, Germany invaded the Czech provinces of Bohemia and Moravia, including Prague. Though Chamberlain's initial parliamentary response was, according to biographer Nick Smart, \"feeble,\" within 48&nbsp;hours he had spoken more forcefully against the German aggression.{{sfn|Smart|2010|p=254}} In another Birmingham speech, on 17 March, Chamberlain warned that \"no greater mistake could be made than to suppose that because it believes war to be a senseless and cruel thing the nation has so lost its fibre that it will not take part to the utmost of its power in resisting such a challenge if it were ever made.\"{{sfn|Self|2006|pp=352\u201353}} The Prime Minister questioned whether the invasion of Czechoslovakia was \"the end of an old adventure, or the beginning of a new\" and whether it was \"a step in the direction of an attempt to dominate the world by force.\"{{sfn|Dutton|2001|p=58}} [[Secretary of State for the Colonies|Colonial Secretary]] [[Malcolm MacDonald]] said, \"whereas the Prime Minister was once a strong advocate of peace, he has now definitely swung around to the war point of view.\"{{sfn|Self|2006|p=353}} This speech was met with widespread approval in Britain and recruitment for the armed services increased considerably.{{sfn|Courcy|1940|p=98}}\n\nChamberlain set out to build an interlocking series of defence pacts among the remaining European countries as a means of deterring Hitler from war.{{sfn|Self|2006|p=354}} He sought an agreement among Britain, France, the USSR, and Poland, whereby the first three would go to the assistance of Poland if her independence were threatened, but Polish mistrust of the Soviet Union caused those negotiations to fail.{{sfn|Self|2006|p=354}} Instead, on 31 March 1939, Chamberlain informed an approving House of Commons of [[Anglo-Polish military alliance|British and]] [[Franco-Polish military alliance|French guarantees]] that they would lend Poland all possible aid in the event of any action which threatened Polish independence.{{sfn|Self|2006|p=357}} In the ensuing debate, Eden stated that the nation was now united behind the government.{{sfn|Dutton|2001|pp=58\u201359}} Even Churchill and Lloyd George praised Chamberlain's government for issuing the guarantee to Poland.{{sfn|Self|2006|p=358}}\n\nThe Prime Minister took other steps to deter Hitler from aggression. He doubled the size of the [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]], created a [[Ministry of Supply]] to expedite the provision of equipment to the armed forces, and instituted peacetime conscription.{{sfn|Smart|2010|p=255}} The [[Italian invasion of Albania]] on 7 April 1939 led to guarantees being given to Greece and Romania.{{sfn|Self|2006|pp=358\u201359}} On 17 June 1939, [[Handley Page]] received an order for 200 [[Handley Page Hampden|Hampden]] twin-engined medium bombers, and by 3 September 1939, the chain of radar stations girdling the British coast was fully operational.<ref>{{cite book|last=Philpott|first=Ian M.|title=The Royal Air Force: An Encyclopedia of the Inter-War Years.

Much of his Cabinet favoured such an alliance, and when Poland withdrew her objection to an Anglo\u2013Soviet alliance, Chamberlain had little choice but to proceed. The talks with Soviet Foreign Minister [[Vyacheslav Molotov]], to which Britain sent only a low-level delegation, dragged on over several months and eventually foundered on 14 August 1939 when Poland and Romania refused to allow Soviet troops to be stationed on their territories. A week after the failure of these talks, the Soviet Union and Germany signed the [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact]], committing the countries to non-aggression toward each other.{{sfn|Self|2006|pp=367\u201369}} A secret agreement divided up Poland in the event of war.{{sfn|Halsall|1997}} Chamberlain had disregarded rumours of a Soviet\u2013German \"rapprochement\" and was dismissive of the publicly announced pact, stating that it in no way affected British obligations toward Poland.{{sfn|Self|2006|p=369}} On 23 August 1939, Chamberlain had Henderson deliver a letter to Hitler telling him that Britain was fully prepared to comply with its obligations to Poland.{{sfn|Smart|2010|p=261}} Hitler instructed his generals to prepare for [[Fall Weiss (1939)|an invasion of Poland]], telling them, \"Our enemies are small worms.

The British Cabinet met late that morning and issued a warning to Germany that unless it withdrew from Polish territory Britain would carry out its obligations to Poland. When the House of Commons met at 6:00&nbsp;pm, Chamberlain and Labour deputy leader [[Arthur Greenwood]] (deputising for the sick Clement Attlee) entered the chamber to loud cheers. Chamberlain spoke emotionally, laying the blame for the conflict on Hitler.{{sfn|Self|2006|p=378}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1939/sep/01/british-note-to-germany|title=BRITISH NOTE TO GERMANY.

French Foreign Minister [[Georges Bonnet]] stated that France could do nothing until its parliament met on the evening of 2 September. Bonnet was trying to rally support for a Munich-style summit proposed by the Italians to be held on 5 September. The British Cabinet demanded that Hitler be given an ultimatum at once, and if troops were not withdrawn by the end of 2 September, that war be declared forthwith. Chamberlain and Halifax were convinced by Bonnet's pleas from Paris that France needed more time for mobilisation and evacuation, and postponed the expiry of the ultimatum (which had in fact not yet been served).{{sfn|Self|2006|pp=378\u201379}} Chamberlain's lengthy statement to the House of Commons made no mention of an ultimatum, and the House received it badly. When Greenwood rose to \"speak for the working classes,\" Conservative backbencher [[Leo Amery]] urged him, \"Speak for England, Arthur,\" implying that the Prime Minister was not doing so.{{sfn|Smart|2010|p=263}} Chamberlain replied that telephone difficulties were making it hard to communicate with Paris and tried to dispel fears that the French were weakening. He had little success; too many members knew of Bonnet's efforts. National Labour MP and diarist [[Harold Nicolson]] later wrote, \"In those few minutes he flung away his reputation.\"{{sfn|Self|2006|p=380}} The seeming delay gave rise to fears that Chamberlain would again seek a settlement with Hitler.{{sfn|Dutton|2001|p=59}} Chamberlain's last peacetime Cabinet met at 11:30 that night, with a thunderstorm raging outside, and determined that the ultimatum would be presented in Berlin at nine o'clock the following morning\u2014to expire two hours later, before the House of Commons convened at noon.{{sfn|Self|2006|p=380}} At 11:15&nbsp;am, Chamberlain addressed the nation by radio, stating that the United Kingdom was at war with Germany:\n\n{{quote\n| I am speaking to you from the cabinet room at 10 Downing Street. This morning the British ambassador in Berlin handed the German government a final note stating that unless we heard from them by 11 o'clock that they were prepared at once to withdraw their troops from Poland, a state of war would exist between us. I have to tell you now that no such undertaking has been received, and that consequently this country is at war with Germany.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/sep/06/second-world-war-declaration-chamberlain|title=Neville Chamberlain's declaration of war}}</ref>&nbsp;...

And against them I am certain that the right will prevail.{{sfn|Feiling|1970|p=416}}\n}}\n\nThat afternoon Chamberlain addressed the House of Commons' first Sunday session in over 120 years. He spoke to a quiet House in a statement which even opponents termed \"restrained and therefore effective\":\n\n{{quote\n| Everything that I have worked for, everything that I have hoped for, everything that I have believed in during my public life has crashed into ruins.

Chamberlain also gave Eden a government post ([[Secretary of State for the Dominions|Dominions Secretary]]) but not a seat in the small War Cabinet. The new First Lord proved to be a difficult Cabinet colleague, deluging the Prime Minister with a sea of lengthy memos. Chamberlain castigated Churchill for sending so many memos, as the two met in War Cabinet every day.{{sfn|Self|2006|pp=386\u201387}} Chamberlain suspected, correctly as it proved after the war, that \"these letters are for the purpose of quotation in the Book that he will write hereafter.\"{{sfn|Self|2006|pp=387\u201388}} Chamberlain was also able to deter some of Churchill's more extreme plans, such as [[Operation Catherine]], which would have sent three heavily armoured battleships into the [[Baltic Sea]] with an aircraft carrier and other support vessels as a means of stopping shipments of iron ore to Germany.{{sfn|Smart|2010|p=269}} With the naval war the only significant front involving the British in the early months of the conflict, the First Lord's obvious desire to wage a ruthless, victorious war established him as a leader-in-waiting in the public consciousness and among parliamentary colleagues.{{sfn|Smart|2010|p=265}}\n\nWith little land action in the west, the initial months of the war were dubbed the \"Bore War,\" later renamed the \"[[Phoney War]]\" by journalists.{{sfn|Self|2006|p=383}} Chamberlain, in common with most Allied officials and generals, felt the war could be won relatively quickly by keeping economic pressure on Germany through a blockade while continuing rearmament.{{sfn|Smart|2010|p=268}} The Prime Minister was reluctant to go too far in altering the British economy. The government submitted an emergency war budget about which Chamberlain stated, \"the only thing that matters is to win the war, though we may go bankrupt in the process.\"{{sfn|Self|2006|p=390}} Government expenditures rose by little more than the rate of inflation between September 1939 and March 1940.{{sfn|Self|2006|p=390}} Despite these difficulties, Chamberlain still enjoyed approval ratings as high as 68%{{sfn|Self|2006|p=391}} and almost 60% in April 1940.{{sfn|Dutton|2001|p=61}}\n\n==== Downfall ====\nIn early 1940 [[Plan R 4|the Allies approved]] a naval campaign designed to seize the northern part of Norway, a neutral country, including the key port of [[Narvik]], and possibly also to seize the iron mines at [[G\u00e4llivare]] in northern Sweden, from which Germany obtained much of its iron ore.{{sfn|Smart|2010|p=273}} As the Baltic froze in winter, the iron ore was then sent south by ship from Narvik. The Allies planned to begin by [[Operation Wilfred|mining Norwegian waters]], thus provoking a German reaction in Norway, and then would occupy much of the country. Unforeseen by the Allies, Germany had also planned to occupy Norway, and on 9 April German troops occupied Denmark and began an [[Operation Weser\u00fcbung|invasion of Norway]]. German forces quickly overran much of the country.{{sfn|Self|2006|pp=415\u201316}} The Allies sent troops to Norway, but they met with little success, and on 26 April the War Cabinet ordered a withdrawal.{{sfn|Self|2006|pp=415\u201316}} The Prime Minister's opponents decided to turn the [[adjournment debate]] for the [[Whitsun]] recess into a challenge to Chamberlain, who soon heard about the plan.

The initial speeches, including Chamberlain's, were nondescript, but Admiral of the Fleet [[Roger Keyes, 1st Baron Keyes|Sir Roger Keyes]], member for [[Portsmouth North (UK Parliament constituency)|Portsmouth North]], in full uniform, delivered a withering attack on the conduct of the Norway campaign, though he excluded Churchill from criticism. [[Leo Amery]] then delivered a speech which he concluded by echoing [[Oliver Cromwell]]'s words on dissolving the [[Long Parliament]]: \"You have sat here too long for any good you are doing. Depart, I say, and let us have done with you. In the name of God, go!\"{{sfn|Self|2006|p=423}} When Labour announced that they would call for a division of the House of Commons, Chamberlain called upon his \"friends\u2014and I still have some friends in this House\u2014to support the Government tonight.\"{{sfn|Self|2006|pp=424\u201325}} Because the use of the word \"friends\" was a conventional term to refer to party colleagues, and, according to biographer Robert Self, many MPs took it that way, it was an \"error of judgment\" for Chamberlain to refer to party loyalty \"when the gravity of the war situation required national unity.\"{{sfn|Self|2006|p=425}} Lloyd George joined the attackers, and Churchill concluded the debate with a vigorous speech in support of the government.{{sfn|Self|2006|p=425}} When the division took place, the government, which had a normal majority of over 200, prevailed by only 81, with 38&nbsp;MPs in receipt of the government whip voting against it, with between 20 and 25 abstaining.{{sfn|Self|2006|p=426}}\n\nChamberlain spent much of 9 May in meetings with his Cabinet colleagues. Many Conservative MPs, even those who had voted against the government, indicated on 9 May and in the days following that they did not wish Chamberlain to depart but rather would seek to reconstruct his government.{{sfn|Dutton|2001|pp=63\u201364}} Chamberlain decided that he would resign unless the Labour Party was willing to join his government, and so he met with Attlee later that day. Attlee was unwilling, but agreed to consult his National Executive then meeting in [[Bournemouth]]. Chamberlain favoured Halifax as the next Prime Minister, but Halifax proved reluctant to press his own claims, and Churchill emerged as the choice. The following day, Germany invaded the [[Low Countries]] and Chamberlain considered remaining in office. Attlee confirmed that Labour would not serve under Chamberlain, though they were willing to serve under someone else. Accordingly, Chamberlain went to Buckingham Palace to resign and advise the King to send for Churchill.{{sfn|Self|2006|pp=428\u201330}} Churchill later expressed gratitude to Chamberlain for not advising the King to send for Halifax, who would have commanded the support of most government MPs.{{sfn|Dutton|2001|p=118}} In a resignation broadcast that evening, Chamberlain told the nation,\n\n{{listen\n| filename = Chamberlain resignation.ogg\n| title = Neville Chamberlain resigns\n| description = Neville Chamberlain speaks to the nation following his resignation as Prime Minister, 10 May 1940.\n}}\n\n{{quote\n| For the hour has now come when we are to be put to the test, as the innocent people of Holland, Belgium, and France are being tested already.

Instead, he accepted the post of [[Lord President of the Council]] with a seat in the shrunken five-member War Cabinet.{{sfn|Self|2006|p=432}} When Chamberlain entered the House of Commons on 13 May 1940, for the first time since his resignation, \"MPs lost their heads, they shouted, they cheered, they waved their order papers, and his reception was a regular ovation.\"{{sfn|Self|2006|p=432}} The House received Churchill coolly;{{sfn|Self|2006|p=432}} some of his great speeches to the chamber, such as \"[[We shall fight on the beaches]],\" met with only half-hearted enthusiasm.{{sfn|Self|2006|p=433}}\n\nChamberlain's fall from power left him deeply depressed; he wrote, \"Few men can have known such a reversal of fortune in so short a time.\"{{sfn|Smart|2010|p=279}} He especially regretted the loss of [[Chequers]] as \"a place where I have been so happy,\" though after a farewell visit there by the Chamberlains on 19 June, he wrote, \"I am content now that I have done that, and shall put Chequers out of my mind.\"{{sfn|Self|2006|p=435}} As Lord President, Chamberlain assumed vast responsibilities over domestic issues and chaired the War Cabinet during Churchill's many absences.{{sfn|Self|2006|p=435}} Attlee later remembered him as \"free from any of the rancour he might have felt against us. He worked very hard and well: a good chairman, a good committeeman, always very businesslike.\"{{sfn|Macklin|2006|p=90}} As chairman of the [[Lord President's Committee]], he exerted great influence over the wartime economy.{{sfn|Self|2006|p=436}} Halifax reported to the War Cabinet on 26 May 1940, with the [[Low Countries]] conquered and French Prime Minister [[Paul Reynaud]] warning that France might have to sign an armistice, that diplomatic contacts with a still-neutral Italy offered the possibility of a negotiated peace. Halifax urged following up and seeing if a worthwhile offer could be obtained. The [[May 1940 War Cabinet Crisis|battle over the course of action within the War Cabinet]] lasted three days; Chamberlain's statement on the final day, that there was unlikely to be an acceptable offer and that the matter should not be pursued at that time, helped persuade the War Cabinet to reject negotiations.{{sfn|Self|2006|pp=435\u201336}}\n\n[[File:David Lloyd George.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=David Lloyd George|[[David Lloyd George]], [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] 1916\u201322, whose contempt for Chamberlain was reciprocated]]\n\nTwice in May 1940, Churchill broached the subject of bringing Lloyd George into the government. Each time, Chamberlain indicated that due to their longtime antipathy he would immediately retire if Lloyd George were appointed a minister. Churchill did not appoint Lloyd George, but brought up the subject with Chamberlain again early in June. This time, Chamberlain agreed to Lloyd George's appointment provided Lloyd George gave a personal assurance to put aside the feud.  Lloyd George declined to serve in Churchill's government.{{sfn|Self|2006|pp=440\u201342}}\n\nChamberlain worked to bring his Conservative Party in line behind Churchill, working with the [[Chief Whip]], [[David Margesson]], to overcome members' suspicions and dislikes of the Prime Minister. On 4 July, after the [[Attack on Mers-el-K\u00e9bir|British attack on the French fleet]], Churchill entered the chamber to a great cheer from Conservative MPs orchestrated by the two, and the Prime Minister was almost overcome with emotion at the first cheer he had received from his own party's benches since May.{{sfn|Self|2006|p=433}} Churchill returned the loyalty, refusing to consider Labour and Liberal attempts to expel Chamberlain from the government.{{sfn|Self|2006|p=436}} When criticisms of Chamberlain appeared in the press, and when Chamberlain learned that Labour intended to use an upcoming secret session of Parliament as a platform to attack him, he told Churchill that he could only defend himself by attacking Labour. The Prime Minister intervened with the Labour Party and the press and the criticism ceased, according to Chamberlain, \"like turning off a tap\".{{sfn|Self|2006|pp=439\u201341}}\n\nIn July 1940, a polemic titled ''[[Guilty Men]]'' was released by \"Cato\"\u2014a pseudonym for three journalists (future Labour leader [[Michael Foot]], former Liberal MP [[Frank Owen (politician)|Frank Owen]], and the Conservative [[Peter Howard (journalist)|Peter Howard]]). It attacked the record of the National Government, alleging that it had failed to prepare adequately for war. It called for the removal of Chamberlain and other ministers who had allegedly contributed to the British disasters of the early part of the war. The short book sold more than 200,000 copies, many of which were passed from hand-to-hand, and went into 27 editions in the first few months, despite not being carried by several major bookshops.{{sfn|Dutton|2001|p=74}} According to historian David Dutton, \"its impact upon Chamberlain's reputation, both among the general public and within the academic world, was profound indeed.\"{{sfn|Dutton|2001|pp=71\u201372}}\n\nChamberlain had long enjoyed excellent health, except for occasional attacks of gout,{{sfn|Dutton|2001|p=18}} but by July 1940 he was in almost constant pain. He sought treatment, and later that month entered hospital for surgery. Surgeons discovered that he was suffering from terminal [[Colorectal cancer|bowel cancer]], but they concealed it from him, instead telling him that he would not require further surgery.{{sfn|Self|2006|pp=442\u201343}} Chamberlain resumed work in mid-August. He returned to his office on 9 September, but renewed pain, compounded by the night-time bombing of London which forced him to go to an air raid shelter and denied him rest, sapped his energy, and he left London for the last time on 19 September, returning to [[Highfield Park, Heckfield|Highfield Park]] in [[Heckfield]].{{sfn|Self|2006|pp=443\u201344}} Chamberlain offered his resignation to Churchill on 22 September 1940. The Prime Minister was initially reluctant to accept, but as both men realised that Chamberlain would never return to work, Churchill finally allowed him to resign. The Prime Minister asked if Chamberlain would accept the highest order of British chivalry, the [[Order of the Garter]], of which his brother had been a member. Chamberlain refused, saying he would \"prefer to die plain 'Mr Chamberlain' like my father before me, unadorned by any title.\"{{sfn|Self|2006|p=445}}\n\nIn the short time remaining to him, Chamberlain was angered by the \"short, cold and for the most part depreciatory\"<!-- That's how he spells it Comment: According to [[MOS:QUOTE]] it doesn't matter how he spells it, but \"depreciatory\" is correct anyway. --> press comments on his retirement, according to him written \"without the slightest sign of sympathy for the man or even any comprehension that there may be a human tragedy in the background.\"{{sfn|Self|2006|p=445}} The King and Queen drove down from [[Windsor Castle|Windsor]] to visit the dying man on 14 October.{{sfn|Self|2006|p=446}} Chamberlain received hundreds of sympathetic letters from friends and supporters. He wrote to [[John Simon, 1st Viscount Simon|John Simon]], who had served as Chancellor of the Exchequer in Chamberlain's government:\n\n{{quote\n| <nowiki>[I]</nowiki>t was the hope of doing something to improve the conditions of life for the poorer people that brought me at past middle life into politics, and it is some satisfaction to me that I was able to carry out some part of my ambition even though its permanency may be challenged by the destruction of war. For the rest I regret nothing that I have done & I can see nothing undone that I ought to have done. I am therefore content to accept the fate that has so suddenly overtaken me.{{sfn|Self|2006|p=446}}\n}}\n\n== Death ==\nChamberlain died of [[bowel cancer]] on 9 November 1940 at the age of 71. A funeral service took place at [[Westminster Abbey]] (due to wartime security concerns, the date and time were not widely publicised). After cremation, his ashes were interred in the Abbey next to those of [[Bonar Law]].{{sfn|Self|2006|pp=447\u201348}} Churchill eulogised Chamberlain in the House of Commons three days after his death:\n\n{{quote\n| Whatever else history may or may not say about these terrible, tremendous years, we can be sure that Neville Chamberlain acted with perfect sincerity according to his lights and strove to the utmost of his capacity and authority, which were powerful, to save the world from the awful, devastating struggle in which we are now engaged. This alone will stand him in good stead as far as what is called the verdict of history is concerned.{{sfn|Self|2006|p=447}}\n}}\n\nThough some Chamberlain supporters found Churchill's oratory to be [[Damn with faint praise|faint praise]] of the late Prime Minister,{{sfn|Self|2006|pp=446\u201347}} Churchill added less publicly, \"Whatever shall I do without poor Neville? I was relying on him to look after the Home Front for me.\"{{sfn|Self|2006|p=439}} Amongst others who paid tribute to Chamberlain in the Commons and in the [[House of Lords]] on 12 November 1940 were Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax (1st Earl of Halifax, Edward Wood), the Leader of the Labour Party, Clement Attlee, and the Liberal Party leader and Air Minister, Sir [[Archibald Sinclair]]. Lloyd George, the only former Prime Minister remaining in the Commons, had been expected to speak, but absented himself from the proceedings.{{sfn|Daniell|1940}} Ever close to his family, the executors of Chamberlain's will were his cousins, [[Wilfred Byng Kenrick]] and [[Martineau family|Sir Wilfrid Martineau]], both of whom, like Chamberlain, were [[Lord Mayor]]s of Birmingham.<ref>{{cite web|last=Gazette|first=London|title=The Right Honourable Arthur Neville Chamberlain|url=http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/35383/supplements/7145/page.pdf|work=Will probate instruction/information of Neville Chamberlain, Page 7145 \u2013 16th December, 1941|publisher=London Gazette|accessdate=13 March 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140312214651/http://www.london-gazette.co.uk/issues/35383/supplements/7145/page.pdf|archive-date=12 March 2014|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n== Legacy and reputation ==\n[[File:Nevilleplaque.jpg|thumb|alt=Round blue plaque on a brick wall.

I do not feel the opposite view&nbsp;... has a chance of survival. Even if nothing further were to be published giving the true inside story of the past two years I should not fear the historian's verdict.{{sfn|Self|2006|p=449}}\n}}\n\n''Guilty Men'' was not the only Second World War tract that damaged Chamberlain's reputation. ''We Were Not All Wrong'', published in 1941, took a similar tack to ''Guilty Men'', arguing that Liberal and Labour MPs, and a small number of Conservatives, had fought against Chamberlain's appeasement policies. The author, Liberal MP [[Geoffrey Mander]], had voted against conscription in 1939.{{sfn|Dutton|2001|p=116}} Another polemic against Conservative policies was ''Why Not Trust the Tories''<!-- No question mark in title --> (1944, written by \"Gracchus\", who was later revealed to be future Labour minister [[Aneurin Bevan]]), which castigated the Conservatives for the foreign policy decisions of Baldwin and Chamberlain. Though a few Conservatives offered their own versions of events, most notably MP [[Quintin Hogg, Baron Hailsham of St Marylebone|Quintin Hogg]] in his 1945 ''[[The Left was Never Right]]'', by the end of the war, there was a very strong public belief that Chamberlain was culpable for serious diplomatic and military misjudgements that had nearly caused Britain's defeat.{{sfn|Dutton|2001|pp=76\u201380}}\n\nChamberlain's reputation was devastated by these attacks from the left. In 1948, with the publication of ''The Gathering Storm'', the first volume of Churchill's six-volume set, ''[[The Second World War (book series)|The Second World War]]'', Chamberlain sustained an even more serious assault from the right. While Churchill stated privately, \"this is not history, this is my case\", his series was still hugely influential.{{sfn|Dutton|2001|pp=105\u201306}} Churchill depicted Chamberlain as well-meaning but weak, blind to the threat posed by Hitler, and oblivious to the fact that (according to Churchill) Hitler could have been removed from power by a grand coalition of European states. Churchill suggested that the year's delay between Munich and war worsened Britain's position, and criticised Chamberlain for both peacetime and wartime decisions.{{sfn|Dutton|2001|pp=108\u201309}} In the years following the publication of Churchill's books, few historians questioned his judgment.{{sfn|Dutton|2001|p=106}}\n\n[[Anne Chamberlain]], the former premier's widow, suggested that Churchill's work was filled with matters that \"are not real misstatements that could easily be corrected, but wholesale omissions and assumptions that certain things are now recognised as facts which actually have no such position\".{{sfn|Dutton|2001|p=107}}\n\nMany of Chamberlain's family letters and his extensive personal papers were bequeathed by his family in 1974 to the Birmingham University Archives.<ref>{{cite web|title=XNC \u2013 Papers of Neville Chamberlain. 1.

The same year, [[A. J. P. Taylor]], in his ''[[The Origins of the Second World War]]'', found that Chamberlain had adequately rearmed Britain for defence (though a rearmament designed to defeat Germany would have taken massive additional resources) and described Munich as \"a triumph for all that was best and most enlightened in British life&nbsp;... <nowiki>[and]</nowiki> for those who had courageously denounced the harshness and short-sightedness of Versailles\".{{sfn|Dutton|2001|pp=143\u201344}}\n\nThe adoption of the \"[[thirty-year rule]]\" in 1967 made available many of the papers of the Chamberlain government over the subsequent three years, helping to explain why Chamberlain acted as he did.{{sfn|Dutton|2001|p=181}} The resultant works greatly fuelled the revisionist school, although they also included books that strongly criticised Chamberlain, such as [[Keith Middlemas]]'s 1972 ''Diplomacy of Illusion'' (which portrayed Chamberlain as a seasoned politician with strategic blindness when it came to Germany). Released papers indicated that, contrary to claims made in ''Guilty Men'', Chamberlain had neither ignored the advice of the Foreign Office nor had he disregarded and run roughshod over his Cabinet.{{sfn|Dutton|2001|pp=157\u201361}} Other released papers showed that Chamberlain had considered seeking a grand coalition amongst European governments like that later advocated by Churchill, but had rejected it on the ground that the division of Europe into two camps would make war more, not less likely.{{sfn|Dutton|2001|pp=162\u201364}} They also showed that Chamberlain had been advised that the Dominions, pursuing independent foreign policies under the [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]], had indicated that Chamberlain could not depend on their help in the event of a Continental war.{{sfn|Dutton|2001|pp=167\u201368}} The Chiefs of Staff report, which indicated that Britain could not forcibly prevent Germany from conquering Czechoslovakia, was first publicly known at this time.{{sfn|Dutton|2001|p=172}}\nIn reaction to the revisionist school of thought regarding Chamberlain a post-revisionist school emerged beginning in the 1990s, using the released papers to justify the initial conclusions of ''Guilty Men''. Oxford historian [[R. A. C. Parker]] argued that Chamberlain could have forged a close alliance with France after the ''[[Anschlu\u00df]]'', in early 1938, and begun a policy of containment of Germany under the auspices of the [[League of Nations]]. While many revisionist writers had suggested that Chamberlain had had few or no choices in his actions, Parker argued that Chamberlain and his colleagues had chosen appeasement over other viable policies.{{sfn|Dutton|2001|pp=182\u201384}} In his two volumes, ''Chamberlain and Appeasement'' (1993) and ''Churchill and Appeasement'' (2000), Parker stated that Chamberlain, due to his \"powerful, obstinate personality\" and his skill in debate, caused Britain to embrace appeasement instead of effective deterrence.{{sfn|Macklin|2006|pp=106\u201307}} Parker also suggested that had Churchill held high office in the second half of the 1930s Churchill would have built a series of alliances which would have deterred Hitler, and perhaps would have caused Hitler's domestic opponents to procure his removal.{{sfn|Macklin|2006|pp=106\u201307}}\n\nDutton observes that Chamberlain's reputation, for good or ill, will probably always be closely tied to evaluation of his policy toward Germany:\n\n{{quote\n| Whatever else may be said of Chamberlain's public life his reputation will in the last resort depend upon assessments of this moment <nowiki>[Munich] and this policy [appeasement].</nowiki> This was the case when he left office in 1940 and it remains so sixty years later.

[[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] politician who served as [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]] from May 1937 to May 1940. He is best known for his foreign policy of [[appeasement]], and in particular for his signing of the [[Munich Agreement]] on 30 September 1938, conceding the German-speaking [[Sudetenland]] region of [[Czechoslovakia]] to [[Nazi Germany|Germany]]. Following the [[German invasion of Poland]] on 1 September 1939, which marked the [[beginning of World War II]], Chamberlain announced the declaration of war on Germany two days later and led Great Britain through the [[Phoney War|first eight months]] of the war until his resignation as prime minister on 10 May 1940.\n\nAfter working in business and local government, and after a short spell as [[Director of National Service]] in 1916 and 1917, Chamberlain followed his father, [[Joseph Chamberlain]], and older half-brother, [[Austen Chamberlain]], in becoming a Member of Parliament in the [[1918 United Kingdom general election|1918 general election]] for the new [[Birmingham Ladywood (UK Parliament constituency)#Elections in the 1910s|Birmingham Ladywood]] division at the age of 49. He declined a junior ministerial position, remaining a [[backbencher]] until 1922. He was rapidly promoted in 1923 to [[Secretary of State for Health|Minister of Health]] and then [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]]. After a short-lived [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]]-led government, he returned as Minister of Health, introducing a range of reform measures from 1924 to 1929. He was appointed Chancellor of the Exchequer in the [[UK National Government|National Government]] in 1931.\n\nChamberlain succeeded [[Stanley Baldwin]] as prime minister on 28 May 1937. His premiership was dominated by the question of policy towards an increasingly aggressive Germany, and his actions at Munich were widely popular among the British at the time. In response to [[Hitler]]'s continued aggression, Chamberlain pledged Great Britain to defend Poland's independence if the latter were attacked, an alliance that brought his country into war after the German invasion of Poland. The [[Norwegian Campaign|failure of Allied forces]] to prevent the German invasion of Norway caused the House of Commons to hold the historic [[Norway Debate]] in May 1940. Chamberlain's conduct of the war was heavily criticised by members of all parties and, in a vote of confidence, his government's majority was greatly reduced. Accepting that a national government supported by all the main parties was essential, Chamberlain resigned the premiership because the Labour and [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] parties would not serve under his leadership. Although he still led the Conservative Party, he was succeeded as prime minister by his colleague [[Winston Churchill]]. Until ill health forced him to resign on 22 September 1940, Chamberlain was an important member of the [[Churchill war ministry|war cabinet]] as [[Lord President of the Council]], heading the government in Churchill's absence. Chamberlain died at 71 on 9 November 1940 of cancer, six months after leaving the premiership.\n\nChamberlain's reputation remains controversial among historians, the initial high regard for him being entirely eroded by books such as ''[[Guilty Men]]'', published in July 1940, which blamed Chamberlain and his associates for the Munich accord and for allegedly failing to prepare the country for war. Most historians in the generation following Chamberlain's death held similar views, led by Churchill in ''[[The Second World War (book series)|The Gathering Storm]]''. Some later historians have taken a more favourable perspective of Chamberlain and his policies, citing government papers released under the [[Thirty-year rule|Thirty Year Rule]] and arguing that going to war with Germany in 1938 would have been disastrous as the UK was unprepared. Nonetheless, Chamberlain is still [[Historical rankings of Prime Ministers of the United Kingdom|unfavourably ranked]] amongst British Prime Ministers.<ref>{{cite book |first=Paul |last=Strangio |title=Understanding Prime-Ministerial Performance: Comparative Perspectives |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kMu2nAZmMbEC&pg=PA226 |year=2013 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=978-0-19-966642-3 |pages=224, 226 |display-authors=etal |accessdate=14 August 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160617080346/https://books.google.com/books?id=kMu2nAZmMbEC&pg=PA226 |archive-date=17 June 2016 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Early life and political career (1869\u20131918) ==\n{{main|Rise of Neville Chamberlain}}\n\n=== Childhood and businessman ===\n[[File:Jchamberlain-achamberlain.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=Joseph Chamberlain and Austen Chamberlain, 1892|[[Joseph Chamberlain]] (seated) and [[Austen Chamberlain]], 1892]]\nChamberlain was born on 18 March 1869 in a house called Southbourne in the [[Edgbaston]] district of [[Birmingham]].{{sfn|Crozier|2004\u201309}} He was the only son of the second marriage of [[Joseph Chamberlain]], who later became [[List of Lord Mayors of Birmingham|Mayor of Birmingham]] and a Cabinet minister.

As a Lord Mayor in wartime, Chamberlain had a huge burden of work and he insisted that his councillors and officials work equally hard.{{sfn|Self|2006|pp=42\u201343}} He halved the Lord Mayor's expense allowance and cut back on the number of civic functions expected of the incumbent.{{sfn|Smart|2010|p=62}} In 1915, Chamberlain was appointed a member of the Central Control Board on liquor traffic.<ref name=www>{{cite book|title=Who Was Who, 1929\u20131940|year=1949|publisher=A and C Black|page=235}}</ref>\n\nIn December 1916, Prime Minister [[David Lloyd George]] offered Chamberlain the new position of [[Director of National Service]], with responsibility for co-ordinating [[conscription]] and ensuring that essential war industries were able to function with sufficient workforces.{{sfn|Smart|2010|p=67}} His tenure was marked by conflict with Lloyd George; in August 1917, having received little support from the Prime Minister, Chamberlain resigned.{{sfn|Smart|2010|pp=77\u201379}} The relationship between Chamberlain and Lloyd George would, thereafter, be one of mutual hatred.{{sfn|Smart|2010|p=70}}\n\nChamberlain decided to stand for the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]],{{sfn|Self|2006|p=68}} and was adopted as Unionist candidate for [[Birmingham Ladywood (UK Parliament constituency)|Birmingham Ladywood]].{{sfn|Dilks|1984|p=262}} After the war ended, [[1918 United Kingdom general election|a general election]] was called almost immediately.{{sfn|Dilks|1984|p=262}} The campaign in this constituency was notable because his Liberal Party opponent was [[Margery Corbett Ashby|Mrs Margery Corbett Ashby]], one of the seventeen women candidates who stood for Parliament at the first election at which women were eligible to do so. Chamberlain reacted to this intervention by being one of the few male candidates to specifically target women voters deploying his wife, issuing a special leaflet headed \"A word to the Ladies\" and holding two meetings in the afternoon.<ref>[http://www.brewinbooks.com/taking_on_the_men Hallam, David J.A.

When Law resigned as party leader, Austen Chamberlain took his place as head of the Unionists in Parliament.{{sfn|Smart|2010|pp=94\u201395}} Unionist leaders were willing to fight the [[1922 United Kingdom general election|1922 election]] in coalition with the Lloyd George Liberals, but on 19 October, Unionist MPs held [[Carlton Club meeting, 19 October 1922|a meeting]] at which they voted to fight the election as a single party. Lloyd George resigned, as did Austen Chamberlain, and Law was recalled from retirement to lead the Unionists as Prime Minister.{{sfn|Smart|2010|p=96}}\n\nMany high-ranking Unionists refused to serve under Law to the benefit of Chamberlain, who rose over the course of ten months from backbencher to Chancellor of the Exchequer.{{sfn|Self|2006|p=87}} Law initially appointed Chamberlain [[Postmaster General of the United Kingdom|Postmaster General]]{{sfn|Self|2006|pp=87\u201388}} and Chamberlain was sworn of the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]].<ref name=kellys>{{cite book|title=Kelly's Handbook to the Titled, Landed and Official Classes 1940|publisher=Kelly's|page=433}}</ref> When Sir [[Arthur Griffith-Boscawen]], the Minister of Health, lost his seat in the 1922 election and was defeated in a by-election in March 1923 by future [[Home Secretary]] [[James Chuter Ede]], Law offered the position to Chamberlain.{{sfn|Self|2006|p=89}} Two months later, Law was diagnosed with advanced, terminal [[throat cancer]]. He immediately resigned and was replaced by Chancellor of the Exchequer [[Stanley Baldwin]]. In August 1923, Baldwin promoted Chamberlain to the position of Chancellor of the Exchequer.{{sfn|Smart|2010|pp=106\u201307}}\n\nChamberlain served only five months in the office before the Conservatives were defeated in the [[1923 United Kingdom general election|1923 general election]]. [[Ramsay MacDonald]] became the first Labour Prime Minister, but his government fell within months, necessitating [[1924 United Kingdom general election|another general election]]. By a margin of only 77 votes, Chamberlain narrowly defeated the Labour candidate, [[Oswald Mosley]], who later led the [[British Union of Fascists]].{{sfn|Macklin|2006|pp=24\u201325}} Believing he would lose if he stood again in Birmingham Ladywood, Chamberlain arranged to be adopted for [[Birmingham Edgbaston (UK Parliament constituency)|Birmingham Edgbaston]], the district of the city where he was born and which was a much safer seat, which he would hold for the rest of his life.{{sfn|Self|2006|p=103}} The Unionists won the election, but Chamberlain declined to serve again as Chancellor, preferring his former position as Minister of Health.{{sfn|Dutton|2001|p=14}}\n\nWithin two weeks of his appointment as Minister of Health, Chamberlain presented the Cabinet with an agenda containing 25 pieces of legislation he hoped to see enacted. Before he left office in 1929, 21 of the 25 bills had passed into law.{{sfn|Self|2006|p=106}} Chamberlain sought the abolition of the elected [[Poor Law]] [[Boards of Guardians]] which administered relief\u2014and which in some areas were responsible for [[rates (tax)|rates]]. Many of the Boards were controlled by Labour, and such Boards had defied the government by distributing relief funds to the able-bodied unemployed.{{sfn|Self|2006|pp=116\u201318}} In 1929, Chamberlain initiated the [[Local Government Act 1929]] to abolish the Poor Law boards entirely. Chamberlain spoke in the Commons for two and a half hours on the [[second reading]] of the Bill, and when he concluded he was applauded by all parties. The Bill passed into law.{{sfn|Smart|2010|pp=139\u201340}}\n\nThough Chamberlain struck a conciliatory note during the [[UK General Strike of 1926|1926 General Strike]], in general he had poor relations with the Labour opposition. Future Labour Prime Minister [[Clement Attlee]] complained that Chamberlain \"always treated us like dirt,\" and in April 1927 Chamberlain wrote: \"More and more do I feel an utter contempt for their lamentable ''stupidity''.\"{{sfn|Self|2006|p=115}} His poor relations with the Labour Party later played a major part in his downfall as Prime Minister.{{sfn|Self|2006|p=429}}\n\n=== Opposition and second term as Chancellor ===\nBaldwin called [[1929 United Kingdom general election|a general election]] for 30 May 1929, resulting in a [[hung parliament]] with Labour holding the most seats. Baldwin and his government resigned and Labour, under MacDonald, again took office.{{sfn|Dilks|1984|pp=584\u201386}} In 1931, the MacDonald government faced a serious crisis as the [[May Report]] revealed that the budget was unbalanced, with an expected shortfall of \u00a3120&nbsp;million. The Labour government resigned on 24 August, and MacDonald formed a [[National Government (1931)|National Government]] supported by most Conservative MPs.{{sfn|Smart|2010|pp=160\u201362}} Chamberlain once again returned to the Ministry of Health.{{sfn|Self|2006|p=161}}\n\nAfter the [[1931 United Kingdom general election|1931 general election]], in which supporters of the National Government (mostly Conservatives) won an overwhelming victory, MacDonald designated Chamberlain as Chancellor of the Exchequer.{{sfn|Self|2006|pp=161\u201362}} Chamberlain proposed a 10% tariff on foreign goods and lower or no tariffs on goods from the colonies and the [[Dominions]]. Joseph Chamberlain had advocated a similar policy, \"[[Imperial Preference]]\";{{sfn|Self|2006|p=163}} Neville Chamberlain laid his bill before the House of Commons on 4 February 1932,{{sfn|Self|2006|pp=165\u201366}} and concluded his address by noting the appropriateness of his seeking to enact his father's proposal. At the end of the speech, Sir Austen Chamberlain walked down from the backbenches and shook his brother's hand.{{sfn|Dutton|2001|p=17}} The [[Import Duties Act 1932]] passed Parliament easily.{{sfn|Smart|2010|p=173}}\n\nChamberlain presented his first budget in April 1932. He maintained the severe budget cuts that had been agreed at the inception of the National Government.{{sfn|Macklin|2006|p=32}} Interest on the war debt was a major cost. Chamberlain reduced the annual interest rate on [[War bond#United Kingdom|most of Britain's war debt]] from 5% to 3.5%. Between 1932 and 1938, Chamberlain halved the percentage of the budget devoted to interest on the war debt.{{sfn|Smart|2010|p=174}}\n\n====War debt====\nChamberlain hoped that a cancellation of the war debt owed to the United States could be negotiated. In June 1933, Britain hosted the [[London Economic Conference|World Monetary and Economic Conference]], which came to nothing as US President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] sent word that he would not consider any war [[debt relief|debt cancellation]].{{sfn|Smart|2010|p=174}} By 1934, Chamberlain was able to declare a budget surplus and reverse many of the cuts in unemployment compensation and civil servant salaries he had made after taking office. He told the Commons, \"We have now finished the story of ''[[Bleak House]]'' and are sitting down this afternoon to enjoy the first chapter of ''[[Great Expectations]]''.\"{{sfn|Dutton|2001|p=17}}\n\n====Welfare spending====\nThe Unemployed Assistance Board (UAB, established by the [[Unemployment Act 1934]]) was largely Chamberlain's creation, and he wished to see the issue of unemployment assistance removed from party political argument.<ref name=\"Bruce1968\">{{cite book|author=Maurice Bruce|title=The coming of the Welfare State|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PCy6AAAAIAAJ|year=1968|publisher=Batsford|page=370|access-date=14 August 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160624170034/https://books.google.com/books?id=PCy6AAAAIAAJ|archive-date=24 June 2016|url-status=live}}</ref> Moreover, Chamberlain \"saw the importance of 'providing some interest in life for the large numbers of men never likely to get work', and out of this realisation was to come the responsibility of the UAB for the 'welfare', not merely the maintenance, of the unemployed.\"<ref>Bruce, p. 371.</ref>\n\n====Defence spending====\nDefence spending had been heavily cut in Chamberlain's early budgets.{{sfn|Macklin|2006|p=36}} By 1935, faced with a resurgent Germany under Hitler's leadership (see [[German re-armament]]), he was convinced of the need for rearmament.{{sfn|Dutton|2001|p=18}} Chamberlain especially urged the strengthening of the [[Royal Air Force]], realising that Britain's historical bulwark, the [[English Channel]], was no defence against air power.{{sfn|Macklin|2006|pp=36\u201342}}\n\nIn 1935, MacDonald stood down as Prime Minister, and Baldwin became Prime Minister for the third time.{{sfn|Smart|2010|pp=199\u2013200}} In the [[1935 United Kingdom general election|1935 general election]], the Conservative-dominated National Government lost 90&nbsp;seats from its massive 1931 majority, but still retained an overwhelming majority of 255 in the House of Commons. During the campaign, deputy Labour leader [[Arthur Greenwood]] had attacked Chamberlain for spending money on rearmament, saying that the rearmament policy was \"the merest scaremongering; disgraceful in a statesman of Mr Chamberlain's responsible position, to suggest that more millions of money needed to be spent on armaments.\"{{sfn|Dutton|2001|p=40}}\n\n====Role in the abdication crisis====\nChamberlain is believed to have had a significant role in the 1936 [[Edward VIII abdication crisis|abdication crisis]]. He wrote in his diary that [[Wallis Simpson]], Edward VIII's intended wife, was \"an entirely unscrupulous woman who is not in love with the King but is exploiting him for her own purposes.

On 28 May, two weeks after the Coronation, Baldwin resigned, advising the King to send for Chamberlain.{{sfn|Macklin|2006|pp=44\u201345}} Austen did not live to see his brother's final \"climb&nbsp;... to the top of the greasy pole,\"{{efn|name=greasy pole}} having died two months earlier.{{sfn|Smart|1999|p=148}}\n\n== Premiership (1937\u20131940) ==\n<!-- linked from redirects [[Premiership of Neville Chamberlain]], [[Prime ministership of Neville Chamberlain]] -->\n{{further|National Government (1937\u20131939)|Chamberlain war ministry}}\n[[File:Neville Chamberlain.jpg|thumb|right|Chamberlain as prime minister]]\nUpon his accession Chamberlain considered calling a general election, but with three and a half years remaining in the current Parliament's term he decided to wait. At 68 he was the second-oldest person in the 20th century (behind Sir [[Henry Campbell-Bannerman]]) to become Prime Minister for the first time,{{sfn|Self|2006|p=261}} and was widely seen as a caretaker who would lead the Conservative Party until the next election and then step down in favour of a younger man, with Foreign Secretary [[Anthony Eden]] a likely candidate. From the start of Chamberlain's premiership a number of would-be successors were rumoured to be jockeying for position.{{sfn|Smart|2010|pp=224\u201325}}\n\nChamberlain had disliked what he considered to be the overly sentimental attitude of both Baldwin and MacDonald on Cabinet appointments and reshuffles. Although he had worked closely with the [[President of the Board of Trade]], [[Walter Runciman, 1st Viscount Runciman of Doxford|Walter Runciman]], on the tariff issue, Chamberlain dismissed him from his post, instead offering him the token position of [[Lord Privy Seal]], which an angry Runciman declined. Chamberlain thought Runciman, a member of the [[Liberal National Party (UK, 1931)|Liberal National Party]], to be lazy.{{sfn|Self|2006|p=261}} Soon after taking office Chamberlain instructed his ministers to prepare two-year policy programmes. These reports were to be integrated with the intent of co-ordinating the passage of legislation through the current Parliament, the term of which was to expire in November 1940.{{sfn|Self|2006|p=264}}\n\nAt the time of his succession Chamberlain's personality was not well known to the public, though he had made annual budget broadcasts for six years. According to Chamberlain biographer Robert Self, these appeared relaxed and modern, showing an ability to speak directly to the camera.{{sfn|Self|2006|p=261}} Chamberlain had few friends among his parliamentary colleagues; an attempt by his [[Parliamentary Private Secretary to the Prime Minister|Parliamentary Private Secretary]], Lord Dunglass (later Prime Minister himself as [[Alec Douglas-Home]]), to bring him to the Commons Smoking Room to socialise with colleagues ended in embarrassing silence.{{sfn|Faber|2008|p=171}} Chamberlain compensated for these shortcomings by devising the most sophisticated [[spin doctor|press management system]] employed by a Prime Minister up to that time, with officials at [[10 Downing Street|Number 10]], led by his chief of press George Steward, convincing members of the press that they were colleagues sharing power and insider knowledge, and should espouse the government line.{{sfn|Faber|2008|p=172}}\n\n=== Domestic policy ===\n[[File:INF3-46 Neville Chamberlain Artist Wooding.jpg|thumb|right|Caricature of Chamberlain, {{circa|1940}}]]\nChamberlain saw his elevation to the premiership as the final glory in a career as a domestic reformer, not realising that he would be remembered for foreign policy decisions.{{sfn|Macklin|2006|p=48}} One reason he sought the settlement of European issues was the hope it would allow him to concentrate on domestic affairs.{{sfn|Macklin|2006|p=52}}\n\nSoon after attaining the premiership, Chamberlain obtained passage of the [[Factories Act 1937]]. This Act was aimed at bettering working conditions in factories, and placed limits on the working hours of women and children.{{sfn|Macklin|2006|p=158}} In 1938, Parliament enacted the [[Coal Act 1938]], which allowed for nationalisation of coal deposits. Another major law passed that year was the [[Holidays with Pay Act 1938]].{{sfn|Macklin|2006|p=158}} Though the Act only recommended that employers give workers a week off with pay, it led to a great expansion of [[holiday camp]]s and other leisure accommodation for the working classes.{{sfn|Dawson|2006}} The Housing Act 1938 provided subsidies aimed at encouraging [[slum clearance]] and maintained [[rent control]].{{sfn|Macklin|2006|p=158}} Chamberlain's plans for the reform of local government were shelved because of the outbreak of war in 1939. Likewise, the raising of the school-leaving age to 15, scheduled for implementation on 1 September 1939, did not go into effect.{{sfn|Taylor|1965|p=406}}\n\n=== Relations with Ireland ===\nRelations between the United Kingdom and the [[Irish Free State]] had been strained since the 1932 appointment of [[\u00c9amon de Valera]] as [[President of the Executive Council of the Irish Free State|President of the Executive Council]]. The [[Anglo-Irish Trade War]], sparked by the withholding of money that Ireland had agreed to pay the United Kingdom, had caused economic losses on both sides, and the two nations were anxious for a settlement. The de Valera government also sought to sever the remaining ties between Ireland and the UK, such as ending the King's status as Irish Head of State. As Chancellor, Chamberlain had taken a hard-line stance against concessions to the Irish, but as premier sought a settlement with Ireland, being persuaded that the strained ties were affecting relations with other Dominions.{{sfn|Self|2006|pp=298\u201399}}\n\nTalks had been suspended under Baldwin in 1936 but resumed in November 1937. De Valera sought not only to alter the constitutional status of Ireland, but to overturn other aspects of the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]], most notably the issue of [[Partition of Ireland|partition]], as well as obtaining full control of the three \"[[Treaty Ports (Ireland)|Treaty Ports]]\" which had remained in British control.

Chamberlain believed that it was essential to cement relations with Italy in the hope that an Anglo\u2013Italian alliance would forestall Hitler from imposing his rule over Austria.

With three million ethnic Germans, the Sudetenland represented the largest German population outside the \"Reich\"{{sfn|Self|2006|p=302}} and Hitler began to call for the union of the region with Germany.{{sfn|Faber|2008|p=156}} Britain had no military obligations toward Czechoslovakia,{{sfn|Smart|2010|p=237}} but France and Czechoslovakia had a mutual assistance pact{{sfn|Self|2006|p=304}} and both the French and Czechoslovaks also had an alliance with the Soviet Union. After the fall of Austria, the Cabinet's Foreign Policy Committee considered seeking a \"grand alliance\" to thwart Germany or, alternatively, an assurance to France of assistance if the French went to war. Instead, the committee chose to advocate that Czechoslovakia be urged to make the best terms it could with Germany.{{sfn|Faber|2008|pp=159\u201360}} The full Cabinet agreed with the committee's recommendation, influenced by a report from the chiefs of staff stating that there was little that Britain could do to help the Czechs in the event of a German invasion.{{sfn|Faber|2008|pp=159\u201360}} Chamberlain reported to an amenable House that he was unwilling to limit his government's discretion by giving commitments.{{sfn|Faber|2008|p=160}}\n\nBritain and Italy signed an agreement in April 1938. In exchange for ''[[de jure]]'' recognition of Italy's Ethiopian conquest, Italy agreed to withdraw some Italian \"volunteers\" from the Nationalist (pro-[[Francisco Franco|Franco]]) side of the [[Spanish Civil War]]. By this point, the Nationalists strongly had the upper hand in that conflict, and they completed their victory the following year.{{sfn|Smart|2010|p=234}} Later that month, the new French Prime Minister, [[\u00c9douard Daladier]], came to London for talks with Chamberlain, and agreed to follow the British position on Czechoslovakia.{{sfn|Faber|2008|p=162}}\n\nIn May, Czech border guards shot two Sudeten German farmers who were trying to cross the border from Germany into Czechoslovakia without stopping for border controls. This incident caused unrest among the Sudeten Germans, and Germany was then said to be moving troops to the border. In response to the report, Prague moved troops to the German border. Halifax sent a note to Germany warning that if France intervened in the crisis on Czechoslovakia's behalf, Britain might support France. Tensions appeared to calm, and Chamberlain and Halifax were applauded for their \"masterly\" handling of the crisis.{{sfn|Self|2006|p=304}} Though it was not known at the time, it later became clear that Germany had had no plans for a May invasion of Czechoslovakia.{{sfn|Self|2006|p=304}} Nonetheless, the Chamberlain government received strong and almost unanimous support from the British press.{{sfn|Faber|2008|p=189}}\n\nNegotiations between the Czech government and the Sudeten Germans dragged on through mid-1938.{{sfn|Faber|2008|pp=202\u201303}} They achieved little result; Sudeten leader [[Konrad Henlein]] was under private instructions from Hitler not to reach an agreement. On 3 August, Walter Runciman (by now Lord Runciman) travelled to Prague as a [[Runciman Mission|mediator]] sent by the British government.{{sfn|Faber|2008|pp=199\u2013200}} Over the next two weeks, Runciman met separately with Henlein, Czechoslovak President [[Edvard Bene\u0161]], and other leaders, but made no progress.{{sfn|Faber|2008|pp=211\u201314}} On 30 August. Chamberlain met his Cabinet and Ambassador Henderson and secured their backing\u2014with only [[First Lord of the Admiralty]] [[Duff Cooper]] dissenting against Chamberlain's policy to pressure Czechoslovakia into making concessions, on the ground that Britain was then in no position to back up any threat to go to war.{{sfn|Faber|2008|pp=230\u201334}}\n\nChamberlain realised that Hitler would likely signal his intentions in his 12 September speech at the annual [[Nuremberg Rally]], and so the Prime Minister discussed with his advisors how to respond if war seemed likely. In consultation with his close advisor Sir [[Horace Wilson (civil servant)|Horace Wilson]], Chamberlain set out \"Plan Z\". If war seemed inevitable, Chamberlain would fly to Germany to negotiate directly with Hitler.{{sfn|Self|2006|p=308}}\n\n==== September 1938: Munich ====\n\n==== Preliminary meetings ====\nLord Runciman continued his work, attempting to pressure the Czechoslovak government into concessions. On 7 September there was an altercation involving Sudeten members of the Czechoslovak parliament in the North Moravian city of [[Ostrava]] (''M\u00e4hrisch-Ostrau'' in German). The Germans made considerable propaganda out of the incident, though the Prague government tried to conciliate them by dismissing Czech police who had been involved. As the tempest grew, Runciman concluded that there was no point in attempting further negotiations until after Hitler's speech. The mission never resumed.{{sfn|Faber|2008|pp=244\u201346}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-H12486, Vorbereitung M\u00fcnchener Abkommen, Chamberlain auf dem Flugplatz Oberwiesenfeld.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|alt=British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain and German Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop, 1938|Chamberlain (centre, hat and umbrella in hands) walks with German Foreign Minister [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]] (right) as the Prime Minister leaves for home after the Berchtesgaden meeting, 16 September 1938.

Thousands gathered outside 10 Downing Street on the night of the speech. At last Hitler addressed his wildly enthusiastic followers:\n\n{{quote\n| The condition of the Sudeten Germans is indescribable. It is sought to annihilate them. As human beings they are oppressed and scandalously treated in an intolerable fashion&nbsp;... The depriving of these people of their rights must come to an end.&nbsp;...

Hitler accepted and Chamberlain flew to Germany on the morning of 15 September; this was the first time, excepting a short jaunt at an industrial fair, that Chamberlain had ever flown. Chamberlain flew to Munich and then travelled by rail to Hitler's retreat at [[Berchtesgaden]].{{sfn|Self|2006|pp=310\u201312}}\n\nThe face to face meeting lasted about three hours. Hitler demanded the annexation of the Sudetenland, and through questioning him, Chamberlain was able to obtain assurances that Hitler had no designs on the remainder of Czechoslovakia or on the areas in Eastern Europe which had German minorities. After the meeting Chamberlain returned to London, believing that he had obtained a breathing space during which agreement could be reached and the peace preserved.{{sfn|Self|2006|pp=312\u201314}} Under the proposals made at Berchtesgaden the Sudetenland would be annexed by Germany if a plebiscite in the Sudetenland favoured it. Czechoslovakia would receive international guarantees of its independence which would replace existing treaty obligations\u2014principally the French pledge to the Czechoslovaks.{{sfn|Smart|2010|p=242}} The French agreed to the requirements. Under considerable pressure the Czechoslovaks also agreed, causing the Czechoslovak government to fall.{{sfn|Faber|2008|pp=319\u201324}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-H12751, Godesberg, Vorbereitung M\u00fcnchener Abkommen.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.2|alt=Chamberlain and Hitler leave the Bad Godesberg meeting, 1938|Chamberlain (left) and Hitler leave the Bad Godesberg meeting, 23 September 1938.]]\n\nChamberlain flew back to Germany, meeting Hitler in [[Bad Godesberg]] on 22 September.{{sfn|Self|2006|p=316}} Hitler brushed aside the proposals of the previous meeting, saying \"that won't do any more\".{{sfn|Self|2006|p=316}} Hitler demanded immediate occupation of the Sudetenland and that Polish and Hungarian territorial claims on Czechoslovakia be addressed. Chamberlain objected strenuously, telling Hitler that he had worked to bring the French and Czechoslovaks into line with Germany's demands, so much so that he had been accused of giving in to dictators and had been booed on his departure that morning. Hitler was unmoved.{{sfn|Self|2006|p=316}}\n\nThat evening, Chamberlain told Lord Halifax that the \"meeting with Herr Hitler had been most unsatisfactory\".{{sfn|Faber|2008|p=334}} The following day, Hitler kept Chamberlain waiting until mid-afternoon, when he sent a five-page letter, in German, outlining the demands he had made orally the previous day. Chamberlain replied by offering to act as an intermediary with the Czechoslovaks, and suggested that Hitler put his demands in a memorandum which could be circulated to the French and Czechoslovaks.{{sfn|Faber|2008|p=337}}\n\nThe leaders met again late on the evening of 23 September\u2014a meeting which stretched into the early morning hours. Hitler demanded that fleeing Czechs in the zones to be occupied take nothing with them. He extended his deadline for occupation of the Sudetenland to 1 October\u2014the date he had long before secretly set for the invasion of Czechoslovakia. The meeting ended amicably, with Chamberlain confiding to Hitler his hopes they would be able to work out other problems in Europe in the same spirit. Hitler hinted that the Sudetenland fulfilled his territorial ambitions in Europe. Chamberlain flew back to London, saying \"It is up to the Czechs now.\"{{sfn|Faber|2008|pp=340\u201342}}\n\n==== Munich conference ====\nHitler's proposals met with resistance not only from the French and Czechoslovaks, but also from some members of Chamberlain's cabinet. With no agreement in sight, war seemed inevitable.{{sfn|Self|2006|pp=318\u201320}} The Prime Minister issued a press statement calling on Germany to abandon the threat of force in exchange for British help in obtaining the concessions it sought.{{sfn|Self|2006|p=321}} On the evening of 27 September, Chamberlain addressed the nation by radio, and after thanking those who wrote to him, stated:\n\n{{quote\n| How horrible, fantastic, incredible it is that we should be digging trenches and trying on gas-masks here because of a quarrel in a far-away country between people of whom we know nothing. It seems still more impossible that a quarrel that has already been settled in principle should be the subject of war.{{sfn|Faber|2008|pp=375\u201376}}\n}}\n\nOn 28 September, Chamberlain called on Hitler to invite him to Germany again to seek a solution through a summit involving the British, French, Germans, and Italians.{{sfn|Faber|2008|p=382}} Hitler replied favourably, and word of this response came to Chamberlain as he was winding up a speech in [[1935 United Kingdom general election|the House of Commons]] which sat in gloomy anticipation of war. Chamberlain informed the House of this in his speech.{{sfn|Self|2006|p=323}} The response was a passionate demonstration, with members cheering Chamberlain wildly. Even diplomats in the galleries applauded. Lord Dunglass later commented, \"There were a lot of appeasers in Parliament that day.\"{{sfn|Self|2006|p=323}}\n\nOn the morning of 29 September Chamberlain left [[Heston Aerodrome]] (to the east of today's [[Heathrow Airport]]) for his third and final visit to Germany.{{sfn|Self|2006|p=324}} On arrival in Munich the British delegation was taken directly to the [[Hochschule f\u00fcr Musik und Theater M\u00fcnchen|''F\u00fchrerbau'']], where Daladier, [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini]], and Hitler soon arrived. The four leaders and their translators held an informal meeting; Hitler said that he intended to invade Czechoslovakia on 1 October. Mussolini distributed a proposal similar to Hitler's Bad Godesberg terms. In reality, the proposal had been drafted by German officials and transmitted to Rome the previous day. The four leaders debated the draft and Chamberlain raised the question of compensation for the Czechoslovak government and citizens, but Hitler refused to consider this.{{sfn|Faber|2008|pp=403\u201307}}\n\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-R69173, M\u00fcnchener Abkommen, Staatschefs.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|left|alt=Chamberlain, Daladier, Hitler, Mussolini, and Italian Foreign Minister Count Ciano as they prepared to sign the Munich Agreement|From left to right, Chamberlain, Daladier, Hitler, Mussolini and Italian Foreign Minister Count [[Galeazzo Ciano]] as they prepare to sign the [[Munich Agreement]]]]\n\nThe leaders were joined by advisors after lunch, and hours were spent on long discussions of each clause of the \"Italian\" draft agreement. Late that evening the British and French left for their hotels, saying that they had to seek advice from their respective capitals. Meanwhile, the Germans and Italians enjoyed the feast which Hitler had intended for all the participants. During this break, Chamberlain advisor [[Horace Wilson (civil servant)|Sir Horace Wilson]] met with the Czechoslovaks; he informed them of the draft agreement and asked which districts were particularly important to them.{{sfn|Faber|2008|pp=407\u201310}} The conference resumed at about 10&nbsp;pm and was mostly in the hands of a small drafting committee.

The two Prime Ministers urged quick acceptance by the Czechoslovaks of the agreement, since the evacuation by the Czechs was to begin the following day.

Hitler agreed, and the two met at Hitler's apartment in the city later that morning. Chamberlain urged restraint in the implementation of the agreement and requested that the Germans not bomb Prague if the Czechs resisted, to which Hitler seemed agreeable. Chamberlain took from his pocket a paper headed \"Anglo\u2013German Agreement,\" which contained three paragraphs, including a statement that the two nations considered the Munich Agreement \"symbolic of the desire of our two peoples never to go to war again.\" According to Chamberlain, Hitler interjected \"''Ja! Ja!''\" (\"Yes! Yes!\") as the Prime Minister read it.{{sfn|Self|2006|pp=324\u201325}} The two men signed the paper then and there. When, later that day, German Foreign Minister [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]] remonstrated with Hitler for signing it, the F\u00fchrer replied, \"Oh, don't take it so seriously.

Large crowds mobbed Heston, where he was met by the [[Lord Chamberlain]], [[George Villiers, 6th Earl of Clarendon|the Earl of Clarendon]], who gave him a letter from [[George VI|King George VI]] assuring him of the Empire's lasting gratitude and urging him to come straight to Buckingham Palace to report.{{sfn|Faber|2008|p=5}} The streets were so packed with cheering people that it took Chamberlain an hour and a half to journey the nine miles (14&nbsp;km) from Heston to the Palace. After reporting to the King, Chamberlain and his wife appeared on the Palace balcony with the King and [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother|Queen]]. He then went to Downing Street; both the street and the front hall of Number 10 were packed.{{sfn|Faber|2008|pp=5\u20137}} As he headed upstairs to address the crowd from a first-floor window, someone called to him, \"Neville, go up to the window and say 'peace for our time'.\"{{efn|name=Peace in our time}} Chamberlain turned around and responded, \"No, I don't do that sort of thing.\"{{sfn|Faber|2008|pp=5\u20137}} Nevertheless, in his statement to the crowd, Chamberlain recalled the words of his predecessor, [[Benjamin Disraeli]], upon the latter's return from the [[Congress of Berlin]]:{{efn|name=Disraeli peace}}\n\n{{quote\n| My good friends, this is the second time there has come back from Germany to Downing Street peace with honour.

Though Cooper opened by setting forth the reasons for his resignation{{sfn|Self|2006|p=330}} and Churchill spoke harshly against the pact, no Conservative voted against the government.

He told the Cabinet in early October 1938, \"<nowiki>[I]</nowiki>t would be madness for the country to stop rearming until we were convinced that other countries would act in the same way. For the time being, therefore, we should relax no particle of effort until our deficiencies had been made good.\"{{sfn|Self|2006|p=333}} Later in October, he resisted calls to put industry on a war footing, convinced that such an action would show Hitler that the Prime Minister had decided to abandon Munich.{{sfn|Self|2006|p=333}} Chamberlain hoped that the understanding he had signed with Hitler at Munich would lead toward a general settlement of European disputes, but Hitler expressed no public interest in following up on the accord.{{sfn|Smart|2010|p=249}} Having considered a general election immediately following Munich,{{sfn|Self|2006|pp=334\u201335}} Chamberlain instead [[Cabinet shuffle|reshuffled his Cabinet]].{{sfn|Smart|2010|p=250}} By the end of the year, public concerns caused Chamberlain to conclude that \"to get rid of this uneasy and disgruntled House of Commons by a General Election\" would be \"suicidal\".{{sfn|Self|2006|p=341}}\n\nDespite Hitler's relative quietness as the \"Reich\" absorbed the Sudetenland, foreign policy concerns continued to preoccupy Chamberlain. He made trips to Paris and Rome, hoping to persuade the French to hasten their rearmament and Mussolini to be a positive influence on Hitler.{{sfn|Smart|2010|pp=250\u201351}} Several of his Cabinet members, led by Foreign Secretary Lord Halifax, began to draw away from the appeasement policy. Halifax was by now convinced that Munich, though \"better than a European war,\" had been \"a horrid business and humiliating\".{{sfn|Self|2006|p=339}} Public revulsion over the pogrom of ''[[Kristallnacht]]'' on 9 November 1938 made any attempt at a \"rapprochement\" with Hitler unacceptable, though Chamberlain did not abandon his hopes.{{sfn|Self|2006|pp=344\u201345}}\n\nStill hoping for reconciliation with Germany, Chamberlain made a major speech in Birmingham on 28 January 1939, in which he expressed his desire for international peace, and had an advance copy sent to Hitler at Berchtesgaden. Hitler seemed to respond; in his \"[[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]]\" speech on 30 January 1939, he stated that he wanted a \"long peace\".{{sfn|Self|2006|pp=345\u201346}} Chamberlain was confident that improvements in British defence since Munich would bring the dictator to the bargaining table.{{sfn|Self|2006|pp=345\u201346}} This belief was reinforced by a German official's conciliatory speech welcoming Ambassador Henderson back to Berlin after an absence for medical treatment in Britain. Chamberlain responded with a speech in [[Blackburn]] on 22 February hoping that the nations would resolve their differences through trade, and was gratified when his comments were printed in German newspapers.{{sfn|Self|2006|p=347}} With matters appearing to improve, Chamberlain's rule over the House of Commons was firm and he was convinced the government would \"romp home\" in a late 1939 election.{{sfn|Self|2006|p=348}}\n\nOn 15 March 1939, Germany invaded the Czech provinces of Bohemia and Moravia, including Prague. Though Chamberlain's initial parliamentary response was, according to biographer Nick Smart, \"feeble,\" within 48&nbsp;hours he had spoken more forcefully against the German aggression.{{sfn|Smart|2010|p=254}} In another Birmingham speech, on 17 March, Chamberlain warned that \"no greater mistake could be made than to suppose that because it believes war to be a senseless and cruel thing the nation has so lost its fibre that it will not take part to the utmost of its power in resisting such a challenge if it were ever made.\"{{sfn|Self|2006|pp=352\u201353}} The Prime Minister questioned whether the invasion of Czechoslovakia was \"the end of an old adventure, or the beginning of a new\" and whether it was \"a step in the direction of an attempt to dominate the world by force.\"{{sfn|Dutton|2001|p=58}} [[Secretary of State for the Colonies|Colonial Secretary]] [[Malcolm MacDonald]] said, \"whereas the Prime Minister was once a strong advocate of peace, he has now definitely swung around to the war point of view.\"{{sfn|Self|2006|p=353}} This speech was met with widespread approval in Britain and recruitment for the armed services increased considerably.{{sfn|Courcy|1940|p=98}}\n\nChamberlain set out to build an interlocking series of defence pacts among the remaining European countries as a means of deterring Hitler from war.{{sfn|Self|2006|p=354}} He sought an agreement among Britain, France, the USSR, and Poland, whereby the first three would go to the assistance of Poland if her independence were threatened, but Polish mistrust of the Soviet Union caused those negotiations to fail.{{sfn|Self|2006|p=354}} Instead, on 31 March 1939, Chamberlain informed an approving House of Commons of [[Anglo-Polish military alliance|British and]] [[Franco-Polish military alliance|French guarantees]] that they would lend Poland all possible aid in the event of any action which threatened Polish independence.{{sfn|Self|2006|p=357}} In the ensuing debate, Eden stated that the nation was now united behind the government.{{sfn|Dutton|2001|pp=58\u201359}} Even Churchill and Lloyd George praised Chamberlain's government for issuing the guarantee to Poland.{{sfn|Self|2006|p=358}}\n\nThe Prime Minister took other steps to deter Hitler from aggression.

Much of his Cabinet favoured such an alliance, and when Poland withdrew her objection to an Anglo\u2013Soviet alliance, Chamberlain had little choice but to proceed. The talks with Soviet Foreign Minister [[Vyacheslav Molotov]], to which Britain sent only a low-level delegation, dragged on over several months and eventually foundered on 14 August 1939 when Poland and Romania refused to allow Soviet troops to be stationed on their territories. A week after the failure of these talks, the Soviet Union and Germany signed the [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact]], committing the countries to non-aggression toward each other.{{sfn|Self|2006|pp=367\u201369}} A secret agreement divided up Poland in the event of war.{{sfn|Halsall|1997}} Chamberlain had disregarded rumours of a Soviet\u2013German \"rapprochement\" and was dismissive of the publicly announced pact, stating that it in no way affected British obligations toward Poland.{{sfn|Self|2006|p=369}} On 23 August 1939, Chamberlain had Henderson deliver a letter to Hitler telling him that Britain was fully prepared to comply with its obligations to Poland.{{sfn|Smart|2010|p=261}} Hitler instructed his generals to prepare for [[Fall Weiss (1939)|an invasion of Poland]], telling them, \"Our enemies are small worms.

The British Cabinet met late that morning and issued a warning to Germany that unless it withdrew from Polish territory Britain would carry out its obligations to Poland. When the House of Commons met at 6:00&nbsp;pm, Chamberlain and Labour deputy leader [[Arthur Greenwood]] (deputising for the sick Clement Attlee) entered the chamber to loud cheers. Chamberlain spoke emotionally, laying the blame for the conflict on Hitler.{{sfn|Self|2006|p=378}}<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1939/sep/01/british-note-to-germany|title=BRITISH NOTE TO GERMANY.

French Foreign Minister [[Georges Bonnet]] stated that France could do nothing until its parliament met on the evening of 2 September. Bonnet was trying to rally support for a Munich-style summit proposed by the Italians to be held on 5 September. The British Cabinet demanded that Hitler be given an ultimatum at once, and if troops were not withdrawn by the end of 2 September, that war be declared forthwith. Chamberlain and Halifax were convinced by Bonnet's pleas from Paris that France needed more time for mobilisation and evacuation, and postponed the expiry of the ultimatum (which had in fact not yet been served).{{sfn|Self|2006|pp=378\u201379}} Chamberlain's lengthy statement to the House of Commons made no mention of an ultimatum, and the House received it badly. When Greenwood rose to \"speak for the working classes,\" Conservative backbencher [[Leo Amery]] urged him, \"Speak for England, Arthur,\" implying that the Prime Minister was not doing so.{{sfn|Smart|2010|p=263}} Chamberlain replied that telephone difficulties were making it hard to communicate with Paris and tried to dispel fears that the French were weakening. He had little success; too many members knew of Bonnet's efforts. National Labour MP and diarist [[Harold Nicolson]] later wrote, \"In those few minutes he flung away his reputation.\"{{sfn|Self|2006|p=380}} The seeming delay gave rise to fears that Chamberlain would again seek a settlement with Hitler.{{sfn|Dutton|2001|p=59}} Chamberlain's last peacetime Cabinet met at 11:30 that night, with a thunderstorm raging outside, and determined that the ultimatum would be presented in Berlin at nine o'clock the following morning\u2014to expire two hours later, before the House of Commons convened at noon.{{sfn|Self|2006|p=380}} At 11:15&nbsp;am, Chamberlain addressed the nation by radio, stating that the United Kingdom was at war with Germany:\n\n{{quote\n| I am speaking to you from the cabinet room at 10 Downing Street. This morning the British ambassador in Berlin handed the German government a final note stating that unless we heard from them by 11 o'clock that they were prepared at once to withdraw their troops from Poland, a state of war would exist between us.

And against them I am certain that the right will prevail.{{sfn|Feiling|1970|p=416}}\n}}\n\nThat afternoon Chamberlain addressed the House of Commons' first Sunday session in over 120 years. He spoke to a quiet House in a statement which even opponents termed \"restrained and therefore effective\":\n\n{{quote\n| Everything that I have worked for, everything that I have hoped for, everything that I have believed in during my public life has crashed into ruins.

Chamberlain also gave Eden a government post ([[Secretary of State for the Dominions|Dominions Secretary]]) but not a seat in the small War Cabinet. The new First Lord proved to be a difficult Cabinet colleague, deluging the Prime Minister with a sea of lengthy memos. Chamberlain castigated Churchill for sending so many memos, as the two met in War Cabinet every day.{{sfn|Self|2006|pp=386\u201387}} Chamberlain suspected, correctly as it proved after the war, that \"these letters are for the purpose of quotation in the Book that he will write hereafter.\"{{sfn|Self|2006|pp=387\u201388}} Chamberlain was also able to deter some of Churchill's more extreme plans, such as [[Operation Catherine]], which would have sent three heavily armoured battleships into the [[Baltic Sea]] with an aircraft carrier and other support vessels as a means of stopping shipments of iron ore to Germany.{{sfn|Smart|2010|p=269}} With the naval war the only significant front involving the British in the early months of the conflict, the First Lord's obvious desire to wage a ruthless, victorious war established him as a leader-in-waiting in the public consciousness and among parliamentary colleagues.{{sfn|Smart|2010|p=265}}\n\nWith little land action in the west, the initial months of the war were dubbed the \"Bore War,\" later renamed the \"[[Phoney War]]\" by journalists.{{sfn|Self|2006|p=383}} Chamberlain, in common with most Allied officials and generals, felt the war could be won relatively quickly by keeping economic pressure on Germany through a blockade while continuing rearmament.{{sfn|Smart|2010|p=268}} The Prime Minister was reluctant to go too far in altering the British economy. The government submitted an emergency war budget about which Chamberlain stated, \"the only thing that matters is to win the war, though we may go bankrupt in the process.\"{{sfn|Self|2006|p=390}} Government expenditures rose by little more than the rate of inflation between September 1939 and March 1940.{{sfn|Self|2006|p=390}} Despite these difficulties, Chamberlain still enjoyed approval ratings as high as 68%{{sfn|Self|2006|p=391}} and almost 60% in April 1940.{{sfn|Dutton|2001|p=61}}\n\n==== Downfall ====\nIn early 1940 [[Plan R 4|the Allies approved]] a naval campaign designed to seize the northern part of Norway, a neutral country, including the key port of [[Narvik]], and possibly also to seize the iron mines at [[G\u00e4llivare]] in northern Sweden, from which Germany obtained much of its iron ore.{{sfn|Smart|2010|p=273}} As the Baltic froze in winter, the iron ore was then sent south by ship from Narvik. The Allies planned to begin by [[Operation Wilfred|mining Norwegian waters]], thus provoking a German reaction in Norway, and then would occupy much of the country. Unforeseen by the Allies, Germany had also planned to occupy Norway, and on 9 April German troops occupied Denmark and began an [[Operation Weser\u00fcbung|invasion of Norway]]. German forces quickly overran much of the country.{{sfn|Self|2006|pp=415\u201316}} The Allies sent troops to Norway, but they met with little success, and on 26 April the War Cabinet ordered a withdrawal.{{sfn|Self|2006|pp=415\u201316}} The Prime Minister's opponents decided to turn the [[adjournment debate]] for the [[Whitsun]] recess into a challenge to Chamberlain, who soon heard about the plan.

The initial speeches, including Chamberlain's, were nondescript, but Admiral of the Fleet Sir [[Roger Keyes, 1st Baron Keyes|Roger Keyes]], member for [[Portsmouth North (UK Parliament constituency)|Portsmouth North]], in full uniform, delivered a withering attack on the conduct of the Norway campaign, though he excluded Churchill from criticism. [[Leo Amery]] then delivered a speech which he concluded by echoing [[Oliver Cromwell]]'s words on dissolving the [[Long Parliament]]: \"You have sat here too long for any good you are doing. Depart, I say, and let us have done with you. In the name of God, go!\"{{sfn|Self|2006|p=423}} When Labour announced that they would call for a division of the House of Commons, Chamberlain called upon his \"friends\u2014and I still have some friends in this House\u2014to support the Government tonight.\"{{sfn|Self|2006|pp=424\u201325}} Because the use of the word \"friends\" was a conventional term to refer to party colleagues, and, according to biographer Robert Self, many MPs took it that way, it was an \"error of judgment\" for Chamberlain to refer to party loyalty \"when the gravity of the war situation required national unity.\"{{sfn|Self|2006|p=425}} Lloyd George joined the attackers, and Churchill concluded the debate with a vigorous speech in support of the government.{{sfn|Self|2006|p=425}} When the division took place, the government, which had a normal majority of over 200, prevailed by only 81, with 38&nbsp;MPs in receipt of the government whip voting against it, with between 20 and 25 abstaining.{{sfn|Self|2006|p=426}}\n\nChamberlain spent much of 9 May in meetings with his Cabinet colleagues. Many Conservative MPs, even those who had voted against the government, indicated on 9 May and in the days following that they did not wish Chamberlain to depart but rather would seek to reconstruct his government.{{sfn|Dutton|2001|pp=63\u201364}} Chamberlain decided that he would resign unless the Labour Party was willing to join his government, and so he met with Attlee later that day. Attlee was unwilling, but agreed to consult his National Executive then meeting in [[Bournemouth]]. Chamberlain favoured Halifax as the next Prime Minister, but Halifax proved reluctant to press his own claims, and Churchill emerged as the choice. The following day, Germany invaded the [[Low Countries]] and Chamberlain considered remaining in office. Attlee confirmed that Labour would not serve under Chamberlain, though they were willing to serve under someone else. Accordingly, Chamberlain went to Buckingham Palace to resign and advise the King to send for Churchill.{{sfn|Self|2006|pp=428\u201330}} Churchill later expressed gratitude to Chamberlain for not advising the King to send for Halifax, who would have commanded the support of most government MPs.{{sfn|Dutton|2001|p=118}} In a resignation broadcast that evening, Chamberlain told the nation,\n\n{{listen\n| filename = Chamberlain resignation.ogg\n| title = Neville Chamberlain resigns\n| description = Neville Chamberlain speaks to the nation following his resignation as Prime Minister, 10 May 1940.\n}}\n\n{{quote\n| For the hour has now come when we are to be put to the test, as the innocent people of Holland, Belgium, and France are being tested already.

Instead, he accepted the post of [[Lord President of the Council]] with a seat in the shrunken five-member War Cabinet.{{sfn|Self|2006|p=432}} When Chamberlain entered the House of Commons on 13 May 1940, for the first time since his resignation, \"MPs lost their heads, they shouted, they cheered, they waved their order papers, and his reception was a regular ovation.\"{{sfn|Self|2006|p=432}} The House received Churchill coolly;{{sfn|Self|2006|p=432}} some of his great speeches to the chamber, such as \"[[We shall fight on the beaches]],\" met with only half-hearted enthusiasm.{{sfn|Self|2006|p=433}}\n\nChamberlain's fall from power left him deeply depressed; he wrote, \"Few men can have known such a reversal of fortune in so short a time.\"{{sfn|Smart|2010|p=279}} He especially regretted the loss of [[Chequers]] as \"a place where I have been so happy,\" though after a farewell visit there by the Chamberlains on 19 June, he wrote, \"I am content now that I have done that, and shall put Chequers out of my mind.\"{{sfn|Self|2006|p=435}} As Lord President, Chamberlain assumed vast responsibilities over domestic issues and chaired the War Cabinet during Churchill's many absences.{{sfn|Self|2006|p=435}} Attlee later remembered him as \"free from any of the rancour he might have felt against us. He worked very hard and well: a good chairman, a good committeeman, always very businesslike.\"{{sfn|Macklin|2006|p=90}} As chairman of the [[Lord President's Committee]], he exerted great influence over the wartime economy.{{sfn|Self|2006|p=436}} Halifax reported to the War Cabinet on 26 May 1940, with the [[Low Countries]] conquered and French Prime Minister [[Paul Reynaud]] warning that France might have to sign an armistice, that diplomatic contacts with a still-neutral Italy offered the possibility of a negotiated peace. Halifax urged following up and seeing if a worthwhile offer could be obtained. The [[May 1940 War Cabinet Crisis|battle over the course of action within the War Cabinet]] lasted three days; Chamberlain's statement on the final day, that there was unlikely to be an acceptable offer and that the matter should not be pursued at that time, helped persuade the War Cabinet to reject negotiations.{{sfn|Self|2006|pp=435\u201336}}\n\n[[File:David Lloyd George.jpg|thumb|upright|alt=David Lloyd George|[[David Lloyd George]], [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]] 1916\u201322, whose contempt for Chamberlain was reciprocated]]\n\nTwice in May 1940, Churchill broached the subject of bringing Lloyd George into the government. Each time, Chamberlain indicated that due to their longtime antipathy he would immediately retire if Lloyd George were appointed a minister. Churchill did not appoint Lloyd George, but brought up the subject with Chamberlain again early in June. This time, Chamberlain agreed to Lloyd George's appointment provided Lloyd George gave a personal assurance to put aside the feud.  Lloyd George declined to serve in Churchill's government.{{sfn|Self|2006|pp=440\u201342}}\n\nChamberlain worked to bring his Conservative Party in line behind Churchill, working with the [[Chief Whip]], [[David Margesson]], to overcome members' suspicions and dislikes of the Prime Minister. On 4 July, after the [[Attack on Mers-el-K\u00e9bir|British attack on the French fleet]], Churchill entered the chamber to a great cheer from Conservative MPs orchestrated by the two, and the Prime Minister was almost overcome with emotion at the first cheer he had received from his own party's benches since May.{{sfn|Self|2006|p=433}} Churchill returned the loyalty, refusing to consider Labour and Liberal attempts to expel Chamberlain from the government.{{sfn|Self|2006|p=436}} When criticisms of Chamberlain appeared in the press, and when Chamberlain learned that Labour intended to use an upcoming secret session of Parliament as a platform to attack him, he told Churchill that he could only defend himself by attacking Labour. The Prime Minister intervened with the Labour Party and the press and the criticism ceased, according to Chamberlain, \"like turning off a tap\".{{sfn|Self|2006|pp=439\u201341}}\n\nIn July 1940, a polemic titled ''[[Guilty Men]]'' was released by \"Cato\"\u2014a pseudonym for three journalists (future Labour leader [[Michael Foot]], former Liberal MP [[Frank Owen (politician)|Frank Owen]], and the Conservative [[Peter Howard (journalist)|Peter Howard]]). It attacked the record of the National Government, alleging that it had failed to prepare adequately for war. It called for the removal of Chamberlain and other ministers who had allegedly contributed to the British disasters of the early part of the war. The short book sold more than 200,000 copies, many of which were passed from hand-to-hand, and went into 27 editions in the first few months, despite not being carried by several major bookshops.{{sfn|Dutton|2001|p=74}} According to historian David Dutton, \"its impact upon Chamberlain's reputation, both among the general public and within the academic world, was profound indeed.\"{{sfn|Dutton|2001|pp=71\u201372}}\n\nChamberlain had long enjoyed excellent health, except for occasional attacks of gout,{{sfn|Dutton|2001|p=18}} but by July 1940 he was in almost constant pain. He sought treatment, and later that month entered hospital for surgery. Surgeons discovered that he was suffering from terminal [[Colorectal cancer|bowel cancer]], but they concealed it from him, instead telling him that he would not require further surgery.{{sfn|Self|2006|pp=442\u201343}} Chamberlain resumed work in mid-August. He returned to his office on 9 September, but renewed pain, compounded by the night-time bombing of London which forced him to go to an air raid shelter and denied him rest, sapped his energy, and he left London for the last time on 19 September, returning to [[Highfield Park, Heckfield|Highfield Park]] in [[Heckfield]].{{sfn|Self|2006|pp=443\u201344}} Chamberlain offered his resignation to Churchill on 22 September 1940. The Prime Minister was initially reluctant to accept, but as both men realised that Chamberlain would never return to work, Churchill finally allowed him to resign. The Prime Minister asked if Chamberlain would accept the highest order of British chivalry, the [[Order of the Garter]], of which his brother had been a member. Chamberlain refused, saying he would \"prefer to die plain 'Mr Chamberlain' like my father before me, unadorned by any title.\"{{sfn|Self|2006|p=445}}\n\nIn the short time remaining to him, Chamberlain was angered by the \"short, cold and for the most part depreciatory\"<!-- That's how he spells it Comment: According to [[MOS:QUOTE]] it doesn't matter how he spells it, but \"depreciatory\" is correct anyway. --> press comments on his retirement, according to him written \"without the slightest sign of sympathy for the man or even any comprehension that there may be a human tragedy in the background.\"{{sfn|Self|2006|p=445}} The King and Queen drove down from [[Windsor Castle|Windsor]] to visit the dying man on 14 October.{{sfn|Self|2006|p=446}} Chamberlain received hundreds of sympathetic letters from friends and supporters.

I do not feel the opposite view&nbsp;... has a chance of survival. Even if nothing further were to be published giving the true inside story of the past two years I should not fear the historian's verdict.{{sfn|Self|2006|p=449}}\n}}\n\n''Guilty Men'' was not the only Second World War tract that damaged Chamberlain's reputation. ''We Were Not All Wrong'', published in 1941, took a similar tack to ''Guilty Men'', arguing that Liberal and Labour MPs, and a small number of Conservatives, had fought against Chamberlain's appeasement policies. The author, Liberal MP [[Geoffrey Mander]], had voted against conscription in 1939.{{sfn|Dutton|2001|p=116}} Another polemic against Conservative policies was ''Why Not Trust the Tories''<!-- No question mark in title --> (1944, written by \"Gracchus\", who was later revealed to be future Labour minister [[Aneurin Bevan]]), which castigated the Conservatives for the foreign policy decisions of Baldwin and Chamberlain. Though a few Conservatives offered their own versions of events, most notably MP [[Quintin Hogg, Baron Hailsham of St Marylebone|Quintin Hogg]] in his 1945 ''[[The Left was Never Right]]'', by the end of the war, there was a very strong public belief that Chamberlain was culpable for serious diplomatic and military misjudgements that had nearly caused Britain's defeat.{{sfn|Dutton|2001|pp=76\u201380}}\n\nChamberlain's reputation was devastated by these attacks from the left. In 1948, with the publication of ''The Gathering Storm'', the first volume of Churchill's six-volume set, ''[[The Second World War (book series)|The Second World War]]'', Chamberlain sustained an even more serious assault from the right. While Churchill stated privately, \"this is not history, this is my case\", his series was still hugely influential.{{sfn|Dutton|2001|pp=105\u201306}} Churchill depicted Chamberlain as well-meaning but weak, blind to the threat posed by Hitler, and oblivious to the fact that (according to Churchill) Hitler could have been removed from power by a grand coalition of European states. Churchill suggested that the year's delay between Munich and war worsened Britain's position, and criticised Chamberlain for both peacetime and wartime decisions.{{sfn|Dutton|2001|pp=108\u201309}} In the years following the publication of Churchill's books, few historians questioned his judgment.{{sfn|Dutton|2001|p=106}}\n\n[[Anne Chamberlain]], the former premier's widow, suggested that Churchill's work was filled with matters that \"are not real misstatements that could easily be corrected, but wholesale omissions and assumptions that certain things are now recognised as facts which actually have no such position\".{{sfn|Dutton|2001|p=107}}\n\nMany of Chamberlain's family letters and his extensive personal papers were bequeathed by his family in 1974 to the Birmingham University Archives.<ref>{{cite web|title=XNC \u2013 Papers of Neville Chamberlain. 1.

The same year, [[A. J. P. Taylor]], in his ''[[The Origins of the Second World War]]'', found that Chamberlain had adequately rearmed Britain for defence (though a rearmament designed to defeat Germany would have taken massive additional resources) and described Munich as \"a triumph for all that was best and most enlightened in British life&nbsp;... <nowiki>[and]</nowiki> for those who had courageously denounced the harshness and short-sightedness of Versailles\".{{sfn|Dutton|2001|pp=143\u201344}}\n\nThe adoption of the \"[[thirty-year rule]]\" in 1967 made available many of the papers of the Chamberlain government over the subsequent three years, helping to explain why Chamberlain acted as he did.{{sfn|Dutton|2001|p=181}} The resultant works greatly fuelled the revisionist school, although they also included books that strongly criticised Chamberlain, such as [[Keith Middlemas]]'s 1972 ''Diplomacy of Illusion'' (which portrayed Chamberlain as a seasoned politician with strategic blindness when it came to Germany). Released papers indicated that, contrary to claims made in ''Guilty Men'', Chamberlain had neither ignored the advice of the Foreign Office nor had he disregarded and run roughshod over his Cabinet.{{sfn|Dutton|2001|pp=157\u201361}} Other released papers showed that Chamberlain had considered seeking a grand coalition amongst European governments like that later advocated by Churchill, but had rejected it on the ground that the division of Europe into two camps would make war more, not less likely.{{sfn|Dutton|2001|pp=162\u201364}} They also showed that Chamberlain had been advised that the Dominions, pursuing independent foreign policies under the [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]], had indicated that Chamberlain could not depend on their help in the event of a Continental war.{{sfn|Dutton|2001|pp=167\u201368}} The Chiefs of Staff report, which indicated that Britain could not forcibly prevent Germany from conquering Czechoslovakia, was first publicly known at this time.{{sfn|Dutton|2001|p=172}}\nIn reaction to the revisionist school of thought regarding Chamberlain a post-revisionist school emerged beginning in the 1990s, using the released papers to justify the initial conclusions of ''Guilty Men''. Oxford historian [[R. A. C. Parker]] argued that Chamberlain could have forged a close alliance with France after the ''[[Anschlu\u00df]]'', in early 1938, and begun a policy of containment of Germany under the auspices of the [[League of Nations]]. While many revisionist writers had suggested that Chamberlain had had few or no choices in his actions, Parker argued that Chamberlain and his colleagues had chosen appeasement over other viable policies.{{sfn|Dutton|2001|pp=182\u201384}} In his two volumes, ''Chamberlain and Appeasement'' (1993) and ''Churchill and Appeasement'' (2000), Parker stated that Chamberlain, due to his \"powerful, obstinate personality\" and his skill in debate, caused Britain to embrace appeasement instead of effective deterrence.{{sfn|Macklin|2006|pp=106\u201307}} Parker also suggested that had Churchill held high office in the second half of the 1930s Churchill would have built a series of alliances which would have deterred Hitler, and perhaps would have caused Hitler's domestic opponents to procure his removal.{{sfn|Macklin|2006|pp=106\u201307}}\n\nDutton observes that Chamberlain's reputation, for good or ill, will probably always be closely tied to evaluation of his policy toward Germany:\n\n{{quote\n| Whatever else may be said of Chamberlain's public life his reputation will in the last resort depend upon assessments of this moment <nowiki>[Munich] and this policy [appeasement].</nowiki> This was the case when he left office in 1940 and it remains so sixty years later. To expect otherwise is rather like hoping that [[Pontius Pilate]] will one day be judged as a successful provincial administrator of the Roman Empire.{{sfn|Dutton|2001|p=7}}\n}}\n\n== Honours ==\n\n=== Academic honours ===\n* [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] (FRS) \u2013 1938<ref name=www />{{sfn|Hadley|1941}}\n* [[Oxford University]] \u2013 [[Doctor of Civil Law|DCL]]<ref name=kellys />\n* [[Cambridge University]] \u2013 LLD<ref name=kellys />\n* [[Birmingham University]] \u2013 LLD<ref name=kellys />\n* [[Bristol University]] \u2013 LLD<ref name=kellys />\n* [[Leeds University]] \u2013 LLD<ref name=kellys />\n* [[Reading University]] \u2013 DLitt<ref name=kellys />\n\n=== Freedoms ===\n* Honorary Freedom [[City of Birmingham]]<ref name=dnb>{{cite book|title=Dictionary of National Biography 1931\u20131940|last=Wickham Legg (Editor)|first=L.G.|year=1949|page=163}}</ref>\n* Honorary Freedom [[City of London]] \u2013 conferred 1940 but died before acceptance, the scroll being presented to his widow in 1941<ref name=dnb />\n\n=== Honorary military appointments ===\n* 1939: Honorary Air Commodore, No 916 (County of Warwick) Balloon Squadron, [[Auxiliary Air Force]]<ref name=kellys />\n\n== Parliamentary election results ==\n{{Neville Chamberlain Parliamentary election results}}\n\n== Notes ==\n'''Explanatory notes'''\n{{notes\n| notes =\n{{efn\n| name = plantation lose\n| Joseph Chamberlain's loss is equivalent to {{nowrap|\u00a329.1 million}} if measured as ''per capita'' gross domestic product; {{nowrap|\u00a34.2 million}} if measured as an RPI equivalent.

In the extreme west, Mayan civilization flourished for hundreds of years. The dominant and most well-known and well-studied state within Honduras' borders was in [[Cop\u00e1n]], which was located in a mainly non-Maya area, or on the frontier between Maya and non-Maya areas. Cop\u00e1n declined with other Lowland centres during the conflagrations of the [[Classic Maya collapse|Terminal Classic]] in the 9th century. The Maya of this civilization survive in western Honduras as the [[Ch'orti' people|Ch'orti']], isolated from their Choltian linguistic peers to the west.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n|title=Language Contact, Inherited Similarity and Social Difference: The story of linguistic interaction in the Maya lowlands\n|author=Danny Law\n|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company\n|date=15 June 2014\n|page=105\n}}\n</ref>\n\nHowever, Cop\u00e1n represents only a fraction of Honduran pre-Columbian history.

Many regions in the north of Honduras never fell to the Spanish, notably the [[Mosquito Coast|Miskito Kingdom]]. After the Spanish conquest, Honduras became part of Spain's vast empire in the New World within the [[Captaincy General of Guatemala|Kingdom of Guatemala]]. Trujillo and [[Gracias a Dios Department|Gracias]] were the first city-capitals. The Spanish ruled the region for approximately three centuries.\n\n===Spanish Honduras (1524\u20131821)===\nHonduras was organized as a province of the [[Captaincy General of Guatemala|Kingdom of Guatemala]] and the capital was fixed, first at Trujillo on the Atlantic coast, and later at [[Comayagua]], and finally at [[Tegucigalpa]] in the central part of the country.\n\n[[Silver mining]] was a key factor in the Spanish conquest and settlement of Honduras.<ref name=Newson1>{{cite journal\n|last=Newson\n|first=Linda\n|title=Labour in the Colonial Mining Industry of Honduras\n|date=October 1982 |volume=39\n|journal=The Americas\n|doi=10.2307/981334\n|issue=2\n|pages=185\u2013203\n|jstor=981334\n}}</ref> Initially the mines were worked by local people through the [[encomienda]] system, but as disease and resistance made this option less available, slaves from other parts of Central America were brought in.

They managed to found a few towns along the coast, at [[Puerto Cort\u00e9s|Puerto Caballos]] and Trujillo in particular, but failed to conquer the eastern portion of the region and many pockets of independent indigenous people as well. The [[Mosquito Coast|Miskito Kingdom]] in the northeast was particularly effective at resisting conquest. The Miskito Kingdom found support from northern European privateers, pirates and especially the British formerly English colony of [[Jamaica]], which placed much of the area under its protection after 1740.\n\n[[File:Exterior Fuerte de Omoa Honduras.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|The [[Battle of San Fernando de Omoa|Fortaleza de San Fernando de Omoa]] was built by the Spanish to protect the coast of Honduras from English pirates.]]\n\n===Independence (1821)===\nHonduras gained independence from Spain in 1821 and was a part of the [[First Mexican Empire]] until 1823, when it became part of the [[United Provinces of Central America]]. It has been an independent republic and has held regular elections since 1838. In the 1840s and 1850s Honduras participated in several failed attempts at Central American unity, such as the Confederation of Central America (1842\u20131845), the covenant of Guatemala (1842), the Diet of Sonsonate (1846), the Diet of Nacaome (1847) and National Representation in Central America (1849\u20131852). Although Honduras eventually adopted the name Republic of Honduras, the unionist ideal never waned, and Honduras was one of the Central American countries that pushed the hardest for a policy of regional unity.\n\n[[Neoliberal]] policies favoring [[international trade]] and investment began in the 1870s, and soon foreign interests became involved, first in shipping from the north coast, especially tropical fruit and most notably bananas, and then in building railroads. In 1888, a projected railroad line from the Caribbean coast to the capital, [[Tegucigalpa]], ran out of money when it reached [[San Pedro Sula]]. As a result, San Pedro grew into the nation's primary industrial center and second-largest city. [[Comayagua]] was the capital of Honduras until 1880, when the capital moved to Tegucigalpa.\n\nSince independence, nearly 300 small internal rebellions and civil wars have occurred in the country, including some changes of r\u00e9gime.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\n===20th century and the role of American companies===\n{{Seealso|Banana Wars}}\nIn the late nineteenth century, Honduras granted land and substantial exemptions to several US-based fruit and infrastructure companies in return for developing the country's northern regions. Thousands of workers came to the north coast as a result to work in [[Banana production in Honduras|banana plantations]] and other businesses that grew up around the export industry. Banana-exporting companies, dominated until 1930 by the [[Cuyamel Fruit Company]], as well as the [[United Fruit Company]], and [[Standard Fruit Company]], built an [[enclave economy]] in northern Honduras, controlling [[infrastructure]] and creating self-sufficient, tax-exempt sectors that contributed relatively little to economic growth.

Larger population centers generally have modernized water treatment and distribution systems, but water quality is often poor because of lack of proper maintenance and treatment. Rural areas generally have basic drinking water systems with limited capacity for water treatment. Many urban areas have sewer systems in place to collect wastewater, but proper treatment of wastewater is rare. In rural areas sanitary facilities are generally limited to latrines and basic septic pits.\n\nWater and sanitation services were historically provided by the {{Interlanguage link multi|Servicio Aut\u00f3nomo de Alcantarillas y Aqueductos|es}} (SANAA). In 2003, the government enacted a new \"water law\" which called for the [[decentralization]] of water services. Under the 2003 law, local communities have both the right and the responsibility to own, operate, and control their own drinking water and wastewater systems. Since this law passed, many communities have joined together to address water and sanitation issues on a regional basis.\n\nMany national and international non-government organizations have a history of working on water and sanitation projects in Honduras.

There are Protestant seminaries. The Catholic Church, still the only \"church\" that is recognized, is also thriving in the number of schools, hospitals, and pastoral institutions (including its own medical school) that it operates. Its [[archbishop]], [[\u00d3scar Rodr\u00edguez Maradiaga|\u00d3scar Andr\u00e9s Rodriguez Maradiaga]], is also very popular, both with the government, other churches, and in his own church.

There are also dishes from the [[Garifuna people]]. [[Coconut]] and coconut milk are featured in both sweet and savory dishes. Regional specialties include fried [[Fish (food)|fish]], [[tamale]]s, [[carne asada]] and [[baleada]]s.\n\nOther popular dishes include: meat roasted with [[chismol]] and [[carne asada]], chicken with rice and corn, and fried fish with pickled onions and jalape\u00f1os. Some of the ways seafood and some meats are prepared in coastal areas and in the [[Bay Islands Department|Bay Islands]] involve [[coconut]] milk.\n\nThe soups Hondurans enjoy include [[bean]] soup, mondongo soup ([[tripe]] soup), [[seafood]] soups and [[beef]] soups. Generally these soups are served mixed with [[plantain (cooking)|plantains]], [[cassava|yuca]], and cabbage, and served with [[Maize|corn]] [[tortilla]]s.\n\nOther typical dishes are the montucas or corn [[tamale]]s, stuffed tortillas, and tamales wrapped in [[Plantain (cooking)|plantain]] leaves. Honduran typical dishes also include an abundant selection of tropical fruits such as [[papaya]], [[pineapple]], [[plum]], [[sapote]], [[passion fruit]] and bananas which are prepared in many ways while they are still green.\n\n=== Media ===\n{{Further|Media of Honduras}}\nAt least half of Honduran households have at least one television. Public television has a far smaller role than in most other countries. Honduras' main newspapers are [[La Prensa (Honduras)|La Prensa]], [[El Heraldo (Tegucigalpa)|El Heraldo]], [[La Tribuna (Honduras)|La Tribuna]] and Diario Tiempo. The official newspaper is {{Interlanguage link multi|La Gaceta (Honduras)|es|3=La Gaceta}}.\n\n=== Music ===\n{{Further|Music of Honduras}}\n\n[[Punta]] is the main music of Honduras, with other sounds such as Caribbean salsa, [[merengue music|merengue]], reggae, and [[reggaeton]] all widely heard, especially in the north, and Mexican [[ranchera]]s heard in the rural interior of the country.\n\n===Celebrations===\n{{Further|Public holidays in Honduras}}\n\n[[File:Saw dust carpet Comayagua Honduras (1).jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Sawdust carpet]]s of [[Comayagua]] during [[Easter]] celebrations]]\nSome of Honduras' national holidays include Honduras Independence Day on 15 September and Children's Day or D\u00eda del Ni\u00f1o, which is celebrated in homes, schools and churches on 10 September; on this day, children receive presents and have parties similar to Christmas or birthday celebrations. Some neighborhoods have pi\u00f1atas on the street.

Each band wears different colors and features cheerleaders. Fiesta Catracha takes place this same day: typical Honduran foods such as [[bean]]s, [[tamale]]s, baleadas, [[cassava]] with [[chicharr\u00f3n]], and [[tortilla]]s are offered.\n\nOn Christmas Eve people reunite with their families and close friends to have dinner, then give out presents at midnight. In some cities fireworks are seen and heard at midnight. On New Year's Eve there is food and \"cohetes\", fireworks and festivities. Birthdays are also great events, and include pi\u00f1atas filled with candies and surprises for the children.\n\n[[La Ceiba Carnival]] is celebrated in [[La Ceiba]], a city located in the north coast, in the second half of May to celebrate the day of the city's patron saint [[Saint Isidore]]. People from all over the world come for one week of festivities. Every night there is a little carnaval (carnavalito) in a neighborhood. On Saturday there is a big parade with floats and displays with people from many countries. This celebration is also accompanied by the Milk Fair, where many Hondurans come to show off their farm products and animals.\n\n===National symbols===\n[[File:Ara macao - two at Lowry Park Zoo.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|The national bird, ''[[Ara macao]]'']]\nThe [[flag of Honduras]] is composed of three equal horizontal stripes. The blue upper and lower stripes represent the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea. The central stripe is white. It contains five blue stars representing the five states of the [[Federal Republic of Central America|Central American Union]]. The middle star represents Honduras, located in the center of the Central American Union.\n\nThe coat of arms was established in 1945. It is an equilateral triangle, at the base is a volcano between three castles, over which is a rainbow and the sun shining. The triangle is placed on an area that symbolizes being bathed by both seas. Around all of this an oval containing in golden lettering: \"Republic of Honduras, Free, Sovereign and Independent\".\n\nThe \"[[National Anthem of Honduras]]\" is a result of a contest carried out in 1914 during the presidency of [[Manuel Bonilla]]. In the end, it was the poet [[Augusto Coello]] that ended up writing the anthem, with German-born Honduran composer [[Carlos Hartling]] writing the music. The anthem was officially adopted on 15 November 1915, during the presidency of {{Interlanguage link multi|Alberto de Jes\u00fas Membre\u00f1o|es|3=Alberto Membre\u00f1o}}. The anthem is composed of a choir and seven stroonduran.{{clarify|date=June 2016}}\n\nThe national flower is the famous orchid, ''[[Rhyncholaelia]] digbyana'' (formerly known as ''Brassavola digbyana''), which replaced the rose in 1969. The change of the national flower was carried out during the administration of general [[Oswaldo L\u00f3pez Arellano]], thinking that ''Brassavola digbyana'' \"is an indigenous plant of Honduras; having this flower exceptional characteristics of beauty, vigor and distinction\", as the decree dictates it.\n\nThe national tree of Honduras was declared in 1928 to be simply \"the Pine that appears symbolically in our [[Coat of Arms]]\" (''el Pino que figura simb\u00f3licamente en nuestro Escudo''),<ref>Acuerdo No. 429, 14 de mayo de 1928.</ref> even though [[pine]]s comprise a [[genus]] and not a [[species]], and even though legally there's no specification as for what kind of pine should appear in the coat of arms ''either''. Because of its commonality in the country, the ''[[Pinus oocarpa]]'' species has become since then the species most strongly associated as the national tree, but legally it is not so. Another species associated as the national tree is the ''[[Pinus caribaea]]''.\n\nThe national mammal is the [[white-tailed deer]] (''Odocoileus virginianus''), which was adopted as a measure to avoid excessive depredation.{{clarify|date=July 2016}} It is one of two species of deer that live in Honduras.\nThe national bird of Honduras is the [[scarlet macaw]] (''Ara macao''). This bird was much valued by the pre-Columbian civilizations of Honduras.\n\n===Folklore===\nLegends and fairy tales are paramount in Honduran culture. [[Lluvia de Peces]] (Rain of Fish) is an example of this. The legends of El [[Cadejo]] and [[La Llorona]] are also popular.\n\n===Sports===\n[[File:Estadio_Olimpico_Metropolitano_de_San_Pedro_Sula_2017_04.jpg|thumb|Football is a very popular sport in Honduras.

In the extreme west, Mayan civilization flourished for hundreds of years. The dominant and most well-known and well-studied state within Honduras' borders was in [[Cop\u00e1n]], which was located in a mainly non-Maya area, or on the frontier between Maya and non-Maya areas. Cop\u00e1n declined with other Lowland centres during the conflagrations of the [[Classic Maya collapse|Terminal Classic]] in the 9th century. The Maya of this civilization survive in western Honduras as the [[Ch'orti' people|Ch'orti']], isolated from their Choltian linguistic peers to the west.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n|title=Language Contact, Inherited Similarity and Social Difference: The story of linguistic interaction in the Maya lowlands\n|author=Danny Law\n|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company\n|date=15 June 2014\n|page=105\n}}\n</ref>\n\nHowever, Cop\u00e1n represents only a fraction of Honduran pre-Columbian history.

Many regions in the north of Honduras never fell to the Spanish, notably the [[Mosquito Coast|Miskito Kingdom]]. After the Spanish conquest, Honduras became part of Spain's vast empire in the New World within the [[Captaincy General of Guatemala|Kingdom of Guatemala]]. Trujillo and [[Gracias a Dios Department|Gracias]] were the first city-capitals. The Spanish ruled the region for approximately three centuries.\n\n===Spanish Honduras (1524\u20131821)===\nHonduras was organized as a province of the [[Captaincy General of Guatemala|Kingdom of Guatemala]] and the capital was fixed, first at Trujillo on the Atlantic coast, and later at [[Comayagua]], and finally at [[Tegucigalpa]] in the central part of the country.\n\n[[Silver mining]] was a key factor in the Spanish conquest and settlement of Honduras.<ref name=Newson1>{{cite journal\n|last=Newson\n|first=Linda\n|title=Labour in the Colonial Mining Industry of Honduras\n|date=October 1982 |volume=39\n|journal=The Americas\n|doi=10.2307/981334\n|issue=2\n|pages=185\u2013203\n|jstor=981334\n}}</ref> Initially the mines were worked by local people through the [[encomienda]] system, but as disease and resistance made this option less available, slaves from other parts of Central America were brought in.

They managed to found a few towns along the coast, at [[Puerto Cort\u00e9s|Puerto Caballos]] and Trujillo in particular, but failed to conquer the eastern portion of the region and many pockets of independent indigenous people as well. The [[Mosquito Coast|Miskito Kingdom]] in the northeast was particularly effective at resisting conquest. The Miskito Kingdom found support from northern European privateers, pirates and especially the British formerly English colony of [[Jamaica]], which placed much of the area under its protection after 1740.\n\n[[File:Exterior Fuerte de Omoa Honduras.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|The [[Battle of San Fernando de Omoa|Fortaleza de San Fernando de Omoa]] was built by the Spanish to protect the coast of Honduras from English pirates.]]\n\n===Independence (1821)===\nHonduras gained independence from Spain in 1821 and was a part of the [[First Mexican Empire]] until 1823, when it became part of the [[United Provinces of Central America]]. It has been an independent republic and has held regular elections since 1838. In the 1840s and 1850s Honduras participated in several failed attempts at Central American unity, such as the Confederation of Central America (1842\u20131845), the covenant of Guatemala (1842), the Diet of Sonsonate (1846), the Diet of Nacaome (1847) and National Representation in Central America (1849\u20131852). Although Honduras eventually adopted the name Republic of Honduras, the unionist ideal never waned, and Honduras was one of the Central American countries that pushed the hardest for a policy of regional unity.\n\n[[Neoliberal]] policies favoring [[international trade]] and investment began in the 1870s, and soon foreign interests became involved, first in shipping from the north coast, especially tropical fruit and most notably bananas, and then in building railroads. In 1888, a projected railroad line from the Caribbean coast to the capital, [[Tegucigalpa]], ran out of money when it reached [[San Pedro Sula]]. As a result, San Pedro grew into the nation's primary industrial center and second-largest city. [[Comayagua]] was the capital of Honduras until 1880, when the capital moved to Tegucigalpa.\n\nSince independence, nearly 300 small internal rebellions and civil wars have occurred in the country, including some changes of r\u00e9gime.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}\n\n===20th century and the role of American companies===\n{{Seealso|Banana Wars}}\nIn the late nineteenth century, Honduras granted land and substantial exemptions to several US-based fruit and infrastructure companies in return for developing the country's northern regions. Thousands of workers came to the north coast as a result to work in [[Banana production in Honduras|banana plantations]] and other businesses that grew up around the export industry. Banana-exporting companies, dominated until 1930 by the [[Cuyamel Fruit Company]], as well as the [[United Fruit Company]], and [[Standard Fruit Company]], built an [[enclave economy]] in northern Honduras, controlling [[infrastructure]] and creating self-sufficient, tax-exempt sectors that contributed relatively little to economic growth.

There are also dishes from the [[Garifuna people]]. [[Coconut]] and coconut milk are featured in both sweet and savory dishes. Regional specialties include fried [[Fish (food)|fish]], [[tamale]]s, [[carne asada]] and [[baleada]]s.\n\nOther popular dishes include: meat roasted with [[chismol]] and [[carne asada]], chicken with rice and corn, and fried fish with pickled onions and jalape\u00f1os. Some of the ways seafood and some meats are prepared in coastal areas and in the [[Bay Islands Department|Bay Islands]] involve [[coconut]] milk.\n\nThe soups Hondurans enjoy include [[bean]] soup, mondongo soup ([[tripe]] soup), [[seafood]] soups and [[beef]] soups. Generally these soups are served mixed with [[plantain (cooking)|plantains]], [[cassava|yuca]], and cabbage, and served with [[Maize|corn]] [[tortilla]]s.\n\nOther typical dishes are the montucas or corn [[tamale]]s, stuffed tortillas, and tamales wrapped in [[Plantain (cooking)|plantain]] leaves. Honduran typical dishes also include an abundant selection of tropical fruits such as [[papaya]], [[pineapple]], [[plum]], [[sapote]], [[passion fruit]] and bananas which are prepared in many ways while they are still green.\n\n=== Media ===\n{{Further|Media of Honduras}}\nAt least half of Honduran households have at least one television. Public television has a far smaller role than in most other countries. Honduras' main newspapers are [[La Prensa (Honduras)|La Prensa]], [[El Heraldo (Tegucigalpa)|El Heraldo]], [[La Tribuna (Honduras)|La Tribuna]] and Diario Tiempo. The official newspaper is {{Interlanguage link multi|La Gaceta (Honduras)|es|3=La Gaceta}}.\n\n=== Music ===\n{{Further|Music of Honduras}}\n\n[[Punta]] is the main music of Honduras, with other sounds such as Caribbean salsa, [[merengue music|merengue]], reggae, and [[reggaeton]] all widely heard, especially in the north, and Mexican [[ranchera]]s heard in the rural interior of the country.\n\n===Celebrations===\n{{Further|Public holidays in Honduras}}\n\n[[File:Saw dust carpet Comayagua Honduras (1).jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|[[Sawdust carpet]]s of [[Comayagua]] during [[Easter]] celebrations]]\nSome of Honduras' national holidays include Honduras Independence Day on 15 September and Children's Day or D\u00eda del Ni\u00f1o, which is celebrated in homes, schools and churches on 10 September; on this day, children receive presents and have parties similar to Christmas or birthday celebrations. Some neighborhoods have pi\u00f1atas on the street. Other holidays are Easter, [[Maundy Thursday]], [[Good Friday]], Day of the Soldier (3 October to celebrate the birth of [[Francisco Moraz\u00e1n]]), Christmas, El Dia de [[Lempira (Lenca ruler)|Lempira]] on 20 July,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.marrder.com/htw/jun99/cultural.htm |title=Honduras This Week Online June 1999 |publisher=Marrder.com |date=9 December 1991 |accessdate=27 June 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110117130102/http://www.marrder.com/htw/jun99/cultural.htm |archivedate=17 January 2011}}</ref> and New Year's Eve.\n\nHonduras Independence Day festivities start early in the morning with marching bands. Each band wears different colors and features cheerleaders. Fiesta Catracha takes place this same day: typical Honduran foods such as [[bean]]s, [[tamale]]s, baleadas, [[cassava]] with [[chicharr\u00f3n]], and [[tortilla]]s are offered.\n\nOn Christmas Eve people reunite with their families and close friends to have dinner, then give out presents at midnight. In some cities fireworks are seen and heard at midnight. On New Year's Eve there is food and \"cohetes\", fireworks and festivities. Birthdays are also great events, and include pi\u00f1atas filled with candies and surprises for the children.\n\n[[La Ceiba Carnival]] is celebrated in [[La Ceiba]], a city located in the north coast, in the second half of May to celebrate the day of the city's patron saint [[Saint Isidore]]. People from all over the world come for one week of festivities. Every night there is a little carnaval (carnavalito) in a neighborhood. On Saturday there is a big parade with floats and displays with people from many countries. This celebration is also accompanied by the Milk Fair, where many Hondurans come to show off their farm products and animals.\n\n===National symbols===\n[[File:Ara macao - two at Lowry Park Zoo.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|The national bird, ''[[Ara macao]]'']]\nThe [[flag of Honduras]] is composed of three equal horizontal stripes. The blue upper and lower stripes represent the Pacific Ocean and the Caribbean Sea. The central stripe is white. It contains five blue stars representing the five states of the [[Federal Republic of Central America|Central American Union]]. The middle star represents Honduras, located in the center of the Central American Union.\n\nThe coat of arms was established in 1945. It is an equilateral triangle, at the base is a volcano between three castles, over which is a rainbow and the sun shining. The triangle is placed on an area that symbolizes being bathed by both seas. Around all of this an oval containing in golden lettering: \"Republic of Honduras, Free, Sovereign and Independent\".\n\nThe \"[[National Anthem of Honduras]]\" is a result of a contest carried out in 1914 during the presidency of [[Manuel Bonilla]]. In the end, it was the poet [[Augusto Coello]] that ended up writing the anthem, with German-born Honduran composer [[Carlos Hartling]] writing the music. The anthem was officially adopted on 15 November 1915, during the presidency of {{Interlanguage link multi|Alberto de Jes\u00fas Membre\u00f1o|es|3=Alberto Membre\u00f1o}}. The anthem is composed of a choir and seven stroonduran.{{clarify|date=June 2016}}\n\nThe national flower is the famous orchid, ''[[Rhyncholaelia]] digbyana'' (formerly known as ''Brassavola digbyana''), which replaced the rose in 1969. The change of the national flower was carried out during the administration of general [[Oswaldo L\u00f3pez Arellano]], thinking that ''Brassavola digbyana'' \"is an indigenous plant of Honduras; having this flower exceptional characteristics of beauty, vigor and distinction\", as the decree dictates it.\n\nThe national tree of Honduras was declared in 1928 to be simply \"the Pine that appears symbolically in our [[Coat of Arms]]\" (''el Pino que figura simb\u00f3licamente en nuestro Escudo''),<ref>Acuerdo No. 429, 14 de mayo de 1928.</ref> even though [[pine]]s comprise a [[genus]] and not a [[species]], and even though legally there's no specification as for what kind of pine should appear in the coat of arms ''either''. Because of its commonality in the country, the ''[[Pinus oocarpa]]'' species has become since then the species most strongly associated as the national tree, but legally it is not so. Another species associated as the national tree is the ''[[Pinus caribaea]]''.\n\nThe national mammal is the [[white-tailed deer]] (''Odocoileus virginianus''), which was adopted as a measure to avoid excessive depredation.{{clarify|date=July 2016}} It is one of two species of deer that live in Honduras.\nThe national bird of Honduras is the [[scarlet macaw]] (''Ara macao''). This bird was much valued by the pre-Columbian civilizations of Honduras.\n\n===Folklore===\nLegends and fairy tales are paramount in Honduran culture. [[Lluvia de Peces]] (Rain of Fish) is an example of this. The legends of El [[Cadejo]] and [[La Llorona]] are also popular.\n\n===Sports===\n[[File:Estadio_Olimpico_Metropolitano_de_San_Pedro_Sula_2017_04.jpg|thumb|Football is a very popular sport in Honduras. [[Estadio Ol\u00edmpico Metropolitano]] in [[San Pedro Sula]].]]\nThe major sports in Honduras are football, basketball, rugby, volleyball and cycling, with smaller followings for athletics, softball and handball.

The film is a [[live-action]] reimagining or retelling of [[Walt Disney]]'s [[Dumbo|1941 animated film of the same name]], which was based on the novel by Helen Aberson and Harold Pearl. The film stars [[Colin Farrell]], [[Michael Keaton]], [[Danny DeVito]], [[Eva Green]] and [[Alan Arkin]]. The story follows a family that works at a failing [[Circus|traveling circus]] as they encounter a baby elephant with extremely large ears who is capable of flying.\n\nPlans for a live-action film adaptation of ''Dumbo'' were announced in 2014, and Burton was confirmed as director in March 2015. Much of the cast signed on in March 2017 and [[principal photography]] began in July 2017 in England, lasting until November. It was the first of four live-action (or photo-realistically [[Computer-generated imagery|computer-generated]]) remakes of prior traditionally-animated films that Disney released in 2019, along with ''[[Aladdin (2019 film)|Aladdin]]'', ''[[The Lion King (2019 film)|The Lion King]]'', and ''[[Lady and the Tramp (2019 film)|Lady and the Tramp]]''.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2468374/dumbo-has-screened-see-the-early-reactions|title=Dumbo Has Screened, See The Early Reactions|date=2019-03-14|website=CINEMABLEND|access-date=2019-04-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190321142320/https://www.cinemablend.com/news/2468374/dumbo-has-screened-see-the-early-reactions|archive-date=March 21, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://screenrant.com/disney-upcoming-movies-live-action-animation-remakes/|title=All The Live-Action Disney Remakes In Development|last=Fuller|first=Becky|date=March 28, 2019|website=Screen Rant|access-date=April 1, 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190401061227/https://screenrant.com/disney-upcoming-movies-live-action-animation-remakes/|archive-date=April 1, 2019|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n''Dumbo'' premiered in [[Los Angeles]] on March 11, 2019, and was theatrically released in the United States on March 29, 2019.

The circus has run into financial troubles and Medici had to sell the circus' [[horse]]s after Holt's wife and co-performer, Annie, died from the [[Spanish flu|Spanish flu outbreak]], so Medici reassigns Holt as the caretaker for the circus' pregnant [[Asian elephant]] \"Mrs. Jumbo\". Mrs. Jumbo gives birth to a calf with unusually large ears and Medici orders Holt to hide the ears before allowing the public to see the calf.\n\nHowever, the calf accidentally reveals his ears in his debut performance in [[Joplin, Missouri]], and the crowd laugh and mockingly names the calf \"Dumbo\" while pelting him with peanuts and other objects. Mrs. Jumbo, horrified and enraged by her son's mistreatment, rampages into the ring, causing extensive damage and accidentally collapsing the [[wikt:big top|big top]], which results in the death of abusive handler Rufus. Afterwards, to prevent a public relations problem, Medici resorts to selling Mrs. Jumbo. Holt's son and daughter, Joe and Milly Farrier, comfort Dumbo and discover that he can fly by flapping his ears. The children also discover that feathers are the key to Dumbo's willingness to fly.\n\nIn another performance, Dumbo plays the role of a firefighter clown to put out a fire with water sprayed from his trunk, but the performance goes awry, and Dumbo is trapped on a high platform surrounded by flames. Milly delivers a feather to Dumbo, giving him the confidence to fly. The audience is astounded when Dumbo flies and word of his talent begins to spread. V. A. Vandevere, the entrepreneur and owner of a [[Bohemian style|bohemian]] amusement park called Dreamland in [[New York City]], approaches Medici and proposes a collaboration; Medici would become Vandevere's partner and the Medici Brothers' Circus' troupe would be employed to perform at Dreamland.\n\nLater, Vandevere demands that Dumbo should fly with French [[trapeze]] artist, Colette Marchant. Colette and Dumbo's debut performance at Dreamland goes awry with Dumbo nearly falling off a high platform leading to him trumpeting in alarm since there is no safety net. Dumbo hears his mother's call in response and realizes that his mother is in an exhibit (Nightmare Island) elsewhere in Dreamland. Dumbo flies out of the circus ring, reuniting with his mother, much to the disappointment of the audience. Fearing that Mrs. Jumbo may become a distraction to him and ruin his reputation, Vandevere orders her to be terminated. Vandevere also fires all the Medici performers from Dreamland.\n\nWhen Holt and the rest of the Medici troupe learn that Vandevere intends to kill Dumbo's mother and it's no longer safe for the two elephants to live with them, they resolve to set both her and Dumbo free. The circus performers utilize their various talents to break Mrs. Jumbo out of her enclosure while Holt and Colette guide Dumbo to fly out of the circus. Vandevere attempts to stop them, but starts a [[electrical fire|fire]] triggered by the mismanagement of Dreamland's electricity system, which spreads and destroys the park.\n\nAfter Dumbo saves Holt and his family from the fire, Holt, Colette, the kids, and the troupe bring Dumbo and his mother to the harbor, where they board a ship back to their native home in India. Afterwards, the renamed Medici Family Circus is re-established and flourishes with Colette as the newest troupe member, Milly as host of a science lecture exhibit, performers dressed as animals in line with the circus's new policy of not [[Circus#Animal acts|using wild animals in captivity for entertainment]]. Vandevere is arrested and tried for misconduct. \n\nMeanwhile, Dumbo and his mother reunite with a herd of wild elephants who applaud their newest members as he flies with joy for their future to come.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Colin Farrell by Gage Skidmore.jpg|right|upright=0.75|thumb|Colin Farrell stars as the film's protagonist for director Tim Burton.

The film is a [[live-action]] reimagining or retelling of [[Walt Disney]]'s [[Dumbo|1941 animated film of the same name]], which was based on the novel by Helen Aberson and Harold Pearl. The film stars [[Colin Farrell]], [[Michael Keaton]], [[Danny DeVito]], [[Eva Green]] and [[Alan Arkin]]. The story follows a family that works at a failing [[Circus|traveling circus]] as they encounter a baby elephant with extremely large ears who is capable of flying.\n\nPlans for a live-action film adaptation of ''Dumbo'' were announced in 2014, and Burton was confirmed as director in March 2015.

The circus has run into financial troubles and Medici had to sell the circus' [[horse]]s after Holt's wife and co-performer, Annie, died from the [[Spanish flu|Spanish flu outbreak]], so Medici reassigns Holt as the caretaker for the circus' pregnant [[Asian elephant]] \"Mrs. Jumbo\". Mrs. Jumbo gives birth to a calf with unusually large ears and Medici orders Holt to hide the ears before allowing the public to see the calf.\n\nHowever, the calf accidentally reveals his ears in his debut performance in [[Joplin, Missouri]], and the crowd laugh and mockingly names the calf \"Dumbo\" while pelting him with peanuts and other objects. Mrs. Jumbo, horrified and enraged by her son's mistreatment, rampages into the ring, causing extensive damage and accidentally collapsing the [[wikt:big top|big top]], which results in the death of abusive handler Rufus. Afterwards, to prevent a public relations problem, Medici resorts to selling Mrs. Jumbo. Holt's son and daughter, Joe and Milly Farrier, comfort Dumbo and discover that he can fly by flapping his ears. The children also discover that feathers are the key to Dumbo's willingness to fly.\n\nIn another performance, Dumbo plays the role of a firefighter clown to put out a fire with water sprayed from his trunk, but the performance goes awry, and Dumbo is trapped on a high platform surrounded by flames. Milly delivers a feather to Dumbo, giving him the confidence to fly. The audience is astounded when Dumbo flies and word of his talent begins to spread. V. A. Vandevere, the entrepreneur and owner of a [[Bohemian style|bohemian]] amusement park called Dreamland in [[New York City]], approaches Medici and proposes a collaboration; Medici would become Vandevere's partner and the Medici Brothers' Circus' troupe would be employed to perform at Dreamland.\n\nLater, Vandevere demands that Dumbo should fly with French [[trapeze]] artist, Colette Marchant. Colette and Dumbo's debut performance at Dreamland goes awry with Dumbo nearly falling off a high platform leading to him trumpeting in alarm since there is no safety net. Dumbo hears his mother's call in response and realizes that his mother is in an exhibit (Nightmare Island) elsewhere in Dreamland. Dumbo flies out of the circus ring, reuniting with his mother, much to the disappointment of the audience. Fearing that Mrs. Jumbo may become a distraction to him and ruin his reputation, Vandevere orders her to be terminated. Vandevere also fires all the Medici performers from Dreamland.\n\nWhen Holt and the rest of the Medici troupe learn that Vandevere intends to kill Dumbo's mother and it's no longer safe for the two elephants to live with them, they resolve to set both her and Dumbo free. The circus performers utilize their various talents to break Mrs. Jumbo out of her enclosure while Holt and Colette guide Dumbo to fly out of the circus. Vandevere attempts to stop them, but starts a [[electrical fire|fire]] triggered by the mismanagement of Dreamland's electricity system, which spreads and destroys the park.\n\nAfter Dumbo saves Holt and his family from the fire, Holt, Colette, the kids, and the troupe bring Dumbo and his mother to the harbor, where they board a ship back to their native home in India. Afterwards, the renamed Medici Family Circus is re-established and flourishes with Colette as the newest troupe member, Milly as host of a science lecture exhibit, performers dressed as animals in line with the circus's new policy of not [[Circus#Animal acts|using wild animals in captivity for entertainment]]. Vandevere is arrested and tried for misconduct. \n\nMeanwhile, Dumbo and his mother reunite with a herd of wild elephants who applaud their newest members as he flies with joy for their future to come.\n\n==Cast==\n[[File:Colin Farrell by Gage Skidmore.jpg|right|upright=0.75|thumb|Colin Farrell stars as the film's protagonist for director Tim Burton.

{"title_page": "Constituent (linguistics)", "text_new": "In [[syntax|syntactic]] analysis, a '''constituent''' is a word or a group of words that functions as a single unit within a hierarchical structure. The constituent structure of sentences is identified using ''tests for constituents''.<ref>Osborne (2018) provides a detailed and comprehensive discussion of tests for constituents, having surveyed dozens of textbooks on the topic. Osborne's article is available here: [http://www.ludjournal.org/index.php?journal=LUD&page=article&op=view&path%5B%5D=59 Tests for constituents: What they really reveal about the nature of syntactic structure]. See also Osborne (2019: 2-6, 73-94).</ref>  These tests apply to a portion of a sentence, and  the results provide evidence about the constituent structure of the sentence. Many constituents are [[phrase]]s. A phrase is a sequence of one or more words (in some theories two or more) built around a [[head (linguistics)|head]] lexical item and working as a unit within a sentence. A word sequence is shown to be a phrase/constituent if it exhibits one or more of the behaviors discussed below. The analysis of constituent structure is associated mainly with [[phrase structure grammar]]s, although [[dependency grammar]]s also allow sentence structure to be broken down into constituent parts.\n\nConstituency tests can be grouped in one of two ways, namely in terms of how widely used they are (i.e. their relative frequency) or in terms of which constituent they test for.\n\n==Tests grouped by how commonly they are used in English==\nTests for constituents are diagnostics used to identify sentence structure. There are numerous tests for constituents that are commonly used to identify the constituents of English sentences. 15 of the most commonly used tests are listed next: 1) [[coordination (linguistics)|coordination]] (conjunction), 2) pro-form substitution (replacement), 3) [[topicalization]] (fronting), 4) ''do-so''-substitution, 5) ''one''-substitution, 6) [[answer ellipsis]] (question test), 7) [[Cleft sentence|clefting]], 8) VP-ellipsis, 9) pseudoclefting, 10) passivization, 11) omission (deletion), 12) intrusion, 13) wh-fronting, 14) general substitution, 15) [[right node raising]] (RNR).\n\nThe order in which these 15 tests are listed here corresponds to the frequency of use, coordination being the most frequently used of the 15 tests and RNR being the least frequently used. A general word of caution is warranted when employing these tests, since they often deliver contradictory results. The tests are merely rough-and-ready tools that grammarians employ to reveal clues about syntactic structure. Some syntacticians even arrange the tests on a scale of reliability, with less-reliable tests treated as useful to confirm constituency though not sufficient on their own. Failing to pass a single test does not mean that the test string is not a constituent, and conversely, passing a single test does not necessarily mean the test string is a constituent. It is best to apply as many tests as possible to a given string in order to prove or to rule out its status as a constituent.\n\nThe 15 tests are introduced, discussed, and illustrated below mainly relying on the same one sentence:<ref>This one sentence has been adapted slightly from Radford 1988:91. Radford uses this sentence to introduce and illustrate sentence structure and tests for constituents that identify this structure.</ref>\n\n::'''Drunks could put off the customers'''.\n\nBy restricting the introduction and discussion of the tests for constituents below mainly to this one sentence, it becomes possible to compare the results of the tests. To aid the discussion and illustrations of the constituent structure of this sentence, the following two sentence diagrams are employed (D = determiner, N = noun, NP = noun phrase, Pa = particle, S = sentence, V = Verb,  VP = verb phrase): \n \n[[File:Competing sentence diagrams.png|Two potential analyses of constituent structure|500px]]\n\nThese diagrams show two potential analyses of the constituent structure of the sentence. A given node in a tree diagram is understood as marking a constituent, that is, a constituent is understood as corresponding to a given node and everything that that node exhaustively dominates. Hence the first tree, which shows the constituent structure according to [[dependency grammar]], marks the following words and word combinations as constituents: ''Drunks'', ''off'', ''the'', ''the customers'', and ''put off the customers''.<ref>Two prominent sources on dependency grammar are Tesni\u00e8re (1959) and \u00c1gel, et al. (2003/2006).</ref> The second tree, which shows the constituent structure according to [[phrase structure|phrase structure grammar]], marks the following words and word combinations as constituents: ''Drunks'', ''could'', ''put'', ''off'', ''the'', ''customers'', ''the customers'', ''put off the customers'', and ''could put off the customers''. The analyses in these two tree diagrams provide orientation for the discussion of tests for constituents that now follows.\n\n===Coordination===\nThe [[coordination (linguistics)|coordination]] test assumes that only constituents can be coordinated, i.e., joined by means of a coordinator such as ''and'', ''or'', or ''but'':<ref>For examples of coordination used as a test for constituent structure, see Baker 1978:269\u201376; Radford 1981:59\u201360; Atkinson et al. 1982:172\u20133; Radford 1988:75\u20138; Akmajian et al. 1990:152\u20133; Borsley 1991:25\u201330; Cowper 1992:34\u20137; Napoli 1993:159\u201361; Ouhalla 1994:17; Radford 1997:104\u20137; Burton\u2013Roberts 1997:66\u201370; Haegeman and Gu\u00e9ron 1999:27; Fromkin 2000:160\u20132; Lasnik 2000:11; Lobeck 2000:61\u20133; B\u00f6rjars and Burridge 2001:27\u201331; Huddleston and Pullum 2002:1348\u20139; van Valin 2001:113\u20134; Poole 2002:31\u20132; Adger 2003:125\u20136; Sag et al. 2003:30; Radford 2004:70\u20131; Kroeger 2005:91, 218\u20139; Tallerman 2005:144\u20136; Haegeman 2006:89\u201392; Payne 2006:162; Kim and Sells 2008:22; Carnie 2010:115\u20136, 125; Quirk et al. 2010:46\u20137; Sobin 2011:31\u20132; Carnie 2013:99\u2013100; Sportiche et al. 2014:62\u20138; M\u00fcller 2016:10, 16\u20137</ref> The next examples demonstrate that coordination identifies individual words as constituents:\n\n::Drunks could put off the customers.\n::(a) ['''Drunks'''] and [bums] could put off the customers.\n::(b) Drunks ['''could'''] and [would] put off the customers.\n::(c) Drunks could ['''put off'''] and [drive away] the customers.\n::(d) Drunks could put off the ['''customers'''] and [neighbors].\n\nThe square brackets mark the conjuncts of the coordinate structures. Based on these data, one might assume that ''drunks'', ''could'', ''put off'', and ''customers'' are constituents in the test sentence because these strings can be coordinated with ''bums'', ''would'', ''drive away'', and ''neighbors'', respectively. Coordination also identifies multi-word strings as constituents:\n\n::(e) Drunks could put off ['''the customers'''] and [the neighbors].\n::(f) Drunks could ['''put off the customers'''] and [drive away the neighbors].\n::(g) Drunks ['''could put off the customers'''] and [would drive away the neighbors].\n\nThese data suggest that ''the customers'',  ''put off the customers'', and ''could put off the customers'' are constituents in the test sentence.\n\nExamples such as (a-g) are not controversial insofar as many theories of sentence structure readily view the strings tested in sentences (a-g) as constituents. However, additional data are problematic, since they suggest that certain strings are also constituents even though most theories of syntax do not acknowledge them as such, e.g.\n\n::(h) Drunks ['''could put off'''] and [would really annoy] the customers. \n::(i) Drunks could ['''put off these'''] and [piss off those] customers. \n::(j) ['''Drunks could'''], and [they probably would], put off the customers.\n\nThese data suggest that ''could put off'', ''put off these'', and ''Drunks could'' are constituents in the test sentence. Most theories of syntax reject the notion that these strings are constituents, though. Data such as (h-j) are sometimes addressed in terms of the [[right node raising]] (RNR) mechanism.\n\nThe problem for the coordination test represented by examples (h-j) is compounded when one looks beyond the test sentence, for one quickly finds that coordination suggests that a wide range of strings are constituents that most theories of syntax do not acknowledge as such, e.g.\n\n::(k) Sam leaves ['''from home on Tuesday'''] and [from work on Wednesday].\n::(l) Sam leaves ['''from home on Tuesday on his bicycle'''] and [from work on Wednesday in his car].\n::(m) Sam leaves ['''from home on Tuesday'''], and [from work].\n\nThe strings ''from home on Tuesday'' and ''from home on Tuesday on his bicycle'' are not viewed as constituents in most theories of syntax, and concerning sentence (m), it is very difficult there to even discern how one should delimit the conjuncts of the coordinate structure. The coordinate structures in (k-l) are sometimes characterized in terms of non-constituent conjuncts (NCC), and the instance of coordination in sentence (m) is sometimes discussed in terms of stripping and/or [[gapping]].\n\nDue to the difficulties suggested with examples (h-m), many grammarians view coordination skeptically regarding its value as a test for constituents. The discussion of the other tests for constituents below reveals that this skepticism is warranted, since coordination identifies many more strings as constituents than the other tests for constituents.<ref>The problems with coordination as a test for constituent structure have been pointed out in numerous places in the literature. See for instance Baker 1989:425; McCawley 1998:63; Adger 2003:125; Payne 2006:162; Kim and Sells 2008:22; Carnie 2010:21; Carnie 2013:100; Sportiche et al. 2014:66; M\u00fcller 2016:16-7.</ref>\n\n===Proform substitution (replacement)===\n[[Proform]] substitution, or replacement, involves replacing the test string with the appropriate proform (e.g. pronoun, pro-verb, pro-adjective, etc.). Substitution normally involves using a definite proform like ''it'', ''he'', ''there'', ''here'', etc. in place of a phrase or a clause. If such a change yields a grammatical sentence where the general structure has not been altered, then the test string is likely a constituent:<ref>For examples of pro-form substitution used as a test for constituents, see Allerton 1979:113\u20134; Radford 1981:63\u20136; Atkinson et al 1982:173\u20134; Radford 1988:78\u201381, 98\u20139; Thomas 1993:10\u201312; Napoli 1993:168; Ouhalla 1994:19; Radford 1997:109; Haegeman and Gu\u00e9ron 1999:46; Fromkin 2000:155\u20138; Lasnik 2000:9\u201310; Lobeck 2000:53\u20137; B\u00f6rjars and Burridge 2001:24\u20135; van Valin 2001: 111\u20132; Poole 2002:29\u201331; Adger 2003:63; Radford 2004:71; Tallerman 2005:140\u20132; Haegeman 2006:74\u20139; Moravcsik 2006:123; Kim and Sells 2008:21\u20132; Culicover 2009:81; Carnie 2010:19\u201320; Quirk et al. 2010:75\u20137; Miller 2011:54\u20135; Sobin 2011:32; Carnie 2013:98; Denham and Lobeck 2013:262\u20135; Sportiche et al. 2014:50; M\u00fcller 2016:8.</ref>\n\n::Drunks could put off the customers.\n::(a) '''They''' could put off the customers. (''They = '''Drunks''''')\n::(b) Drunks could put '''them''' off. (''them = '''the customers'''''; note that shifting of ''them'' and ''off'' has occurred here.)\n::(c) Drunks could '''do it'''. (''do it = '''put off the customers''''')\n\nThese examples suggest that ''Drunks'', ''the customers'', and ''put off the customers'' in the test sentence are constituents. An important aspect of the proform test is the fact that it fails to identify most subphrasal strings as constituents, e.g.\n\n::(d) *Drunks '''do so/it''' put off the customers (''do so/it = could'')\n::(e) *Drunks could '''do so/it''' off the customers (''do so/it = put'')\n::(f) *Drunks could put '''so/it''' the customers (''so/it = off'')\n::(g) *Drunks could put off the '''them'''. (''them = customers'')\n\nThese examples suggest that the individual words ''could'', ''put'', ''off'', and ''customers'' should not be viewed as constituents. This suggestion is of course controversial, since most theories of syntax assume that individual words are constituents by default. The conclusion one can reach based on such examples, however, is that proform substitution using a definite proform identifies phrasal constituents only; it fails to identify sub-phrasal strings as constituents.\n\n===Topicalization (fronting)===\n[[Topicalization]] involves moving the test string to the front of the sentence. It is a simple movement operation.<ref>For examples of topicalization used as a test for constituents, see Allerton 1979:114; Atkinson et al. 1982:171\u20132; Radford 1988:95; Borsley 1991:24; Haegeman 1991:27; Napoli 1993:422; Ouhalla 1994:20; Burton\u2013Roberts 1997:17\u20138; Haegeman and Gu\u00e9ron 1999:46; Fromkin 2000:151; Lasnik 2000:10; Lobeck 2000:47\u20139; B\u00f6rjars and Burridge 2001:26; van Valin 2001:112; Poole 2002:32; Adger 2003:65; Sag et al. 2003:33; Radford 2004:72; Kroeger 2005:31; Downing and Locke 2006:10; Haegeman 2006:79; Payne 2006:160; Culicover 2009:84; Quirk et al. 2010:51; Miller 2011:55; Sobin 2011:31; Sportiche et al. 2014:68; M\u00fcller 2016:10.</ref> Many instances of topicalization seem only marginally acceptable when taken out of context. Hence to suggest a context, an instance of topicalization can be preceded by ''...and'' and a modal adverb can be added as well (e.g. ''certainly''):\n\n::Drunks could put off the customers.\n::(a) ...and '''the customers''', drunks certainly could put off.\n::(b) ...and '''put off the customers''', drunks certainly could.\n\nThese examples suggest that ''the customers'' and ''put off the customers'' are constituents in the test sentence. Topicalization is like many of the other tests in that it identifies phrasal constituents only. When the test sequence is a sub-phrasal string, topicalization fails:\n\n::(c) *...and '''customers''', drunks certainly could put off the.\n::(d) *...and '''could''', drunks certainly put off the customers.\n::(e) *...and '''put''', drunks certainly could off the customers.\n::(f) *...and '''off''', drunks certainly could put the customers.\n::(g) *...and '''the''', drunks certainly could put off customers.\n\nThese examples demonstrate that ''customers'', ''could'', ''put'', ''off'', and ''the'' fail the topicalization test. Since these strings are all sub-phrasal, one can conclude that topicalization is unable to identify sub-phrasal strings as constituents.\n\n===''Do-so''-substitution===\n''Do-so''-substitution is a test that substitutes a form of ''do so'' (''does so'', ''did so'', ''done so'', ''doing so'') into the test sentence for the target string. This test is widely used to probe the structure of strings containing verbs (because ''do'' is a verb).<ref>For examples of the use of ''do-so''-substitution as a test for constituents, see Baker 1978:261\u20138; Aarts and Aarts 1982:56, Atkinson et al. 1982:174; Borsley 1991:63; Haegeman 1991:79\u201382; Cowper 1992:31; Napoli 1993:423\u20135; Burton\u2013Roberts 1997:104\u20137; Haegeman and Gu\u00e9ron 1999:74; Fromkin 2000:156\u20137; van Valin 2001:123, 127; Poole 2002:41\u20133; Tallerman 2005:130\u20131, 141; Haegeman 2006:75\u20136; Payne 2006:162; Culicover 2009:81; Carnie 2010:115\u20136; Quirk et al. 2010:76, 82; Miller 2011:54\u20135; Sobin 2011:33; Carnie 2013:169\u201370; Denham and Lobeck 2013:265; Sportiche et al. 2014:61.</ref> The test is limited in its applicability, though, precisely because it is only applicable to strings containing verbs:\n\n::Drunks could put off the customers.\n::(a) Drunks could '''do so'''. (''do so = '''put off the customers''''')\n::(b) Drunks '''do so'''. (''do so \u2260 '''could put off the customers''''')\n\nThe 'a' example suggests that ''put off the customers'' is a constituent in the test sentence, whereas the b example fails to suggest that ''could put off the customers'' is a constituent, for ''do so'' cannot include the meaning of the modal verb ''could''. To illustrate more completely how the ''do so'' test is employed, another test sentence is now used, one that contains two post-verbal adjunct phrases:\n\n::We met them in the pub because we had time.   \n::(c) We '''did so''' in the pub because we had time. (''did so = '''met them''''')\n::(d) We '''did so''' because we had time. (''did so = '''met them in the pub''''')\n::(e) We '''did so'''. (''did so = '''met them in the pub because we had time''''')\n\nThese data suggest that ''met them'', ''met them in the pub'', and ''met them in the pub because we had time'' are constituents in the test sentence. Taken together, such examples seem to motivate a structure for the test sentence that has a left-branching verb phrase, because only a left-branching verb phrase can view each of the indicated strings as a constituent. There is a problem with this sort of reasoning, however, as the next example illustrates:\n\n::(f) We '''did so''' in the pub. (''did so = '''met them because we had time''''')\n\nIn this case, ''did so'' appears to stand in for the discontinuous word combination consisting of ''met them'' and ''because we had time''. Such a discontinuous combination of words cannot be construed as a constituent. That such an interpretation of ''did so'' is indeed possible is seen in a fuller sentence such as ''You met them in the cafe because you had time, and we did so in the pub''. In this case, the preferred reading of ''did so'' is that it indeed simultaneously stands in for both ''met them'' and ''because we had time''.\n\n===''One''-substitution===\nThe ''one''-substitution test replaces the test string with the indefinite pronoun ''one'' or ''ones''.<ref>For examples of ''one''-substitution used as a test for constituents, see Baker 1978:327\u201340, 413\u201325; Radford 1981:92, 96\u2013100; Aarts and Aarts 1982:57; Haegeman 1991: 26, 88\u20139; Cowper 1992:26; Napoli 1993:423\u20135; Burton\u2013Roberts 1997:182\u20139; McCawley 1998:183; Haegeman and Gu\u00e9ron 1999:75\u20136; Fromkin 2000: 157\u20138; van Valin 2001:122, 126, 128, Poole 2002:37\u20139; Adger 2003:63; Radford 2004:37; Kroeger 2005:97\u20138; Tallerman 2005:150; Haegeman 2006:109; Carnie 2010:114\u20135; Quirk et al. 2010:75; Carnie 2013:166\u20137; Sportiche et al. 2014:52, 57, 60.</ref> If the result is acceptable, then the test string is deemed a constituent. Since ''one'' is a type of pronoun, ''one''-substitution is only of value when probing the structure of noun phrases. In this regard, the test sentence from above is expanded in order to better illustrate the manner in which one-substitution is generally employed:\n\n::Drunks could put off the loyal customers around here who we rely on.\n::(a) Drunks could put off the loyal '''ones''' around here who we rely on. (ones = '''''customers''''')\n::(b) Drunks could put off the '''ones''' around here who we rely on. (''ones = '''loyal customers''''')\n::(c) Drunks could put off the loyal '''ones''' who we rely on. (''ones = '''customers around here''''')\n::(d) Drunks could put off the '''ones''' who we rely on. (''ones = '''loyal customers around here''''')\n::(e) Drunks could put off the loyal '''ones'''. (''ones = '''customers around here who we rely on''''')\n\nThese examples suggest that ''customers'', ''loyal customers'', ''customers around here'', ''loyal customers around here'', and ''customers around here who we rely on'' are constituents in the test sentence. Some have pointed to a problem associated with the ''one''-substitution in this area, however. This problem is that it is impossible to produce a single constituent structure of the noun phrase ''the loyal customers around here who we rely on'' that could simultaneous view all of the indicated strings as constituents.<ref>Concerning the inability of a single constituent structure to simultaneously acknowledge all of the strings that ''one''-substitution suggests are constituents, see Cowper 1992:30, Napoli 1993: 425, Burton-Roberts 1997: 187, and Carnie 2013: 190\u20132.</ref> Another problem that has been pointed out concerning the ''one''-substitution as a test for constituents is the fact that it at times suggests that non-string word combinations are constituents,<ref>The fact that one-substitution at times suggests that non-string word combinations are constituents is illustrated and discussed by Culicover and Jackendoff 2005:136\u20139 and Goldberg and Michaelis 2017:4\u20136.</ref> e.g.\n\n::(f) Drunks would put off the '''ones''' around here. (''ones = '''loyal customers who we rely on''')\n\nThe word combination consisting of both ''loyal customers'' and ''who we rely on'' is discontinuous in the test sentence, a fact that should motivate one to generally question the value of ''one''-substitution as a test for constituents.\n\n===Answer fragments (answer ellipsis, question test, standalone test)===\nThe answer fragment test involves forming a question that contains a single wh-word (e.g. ''who'', ''what'', ''where'', etc.). If the test string can then appear alone as the answer to such a question, then it is likely a constituent in the test sentence:<ref>For examples of answer fragments used as a test for constituents, see Brown and Miller 1980:25; Radford 1981:72, 92; Radford 1988:91; Burton\u2013Roberts 1997:15\u20138; Radford 1997:107; B\u00f6rjars and Burridge 2001:25; Kroeger 2005:31; Tallerman 2005:125; Downing and Locke 2006:10; Haegeman 2006:82; Moravcsik 2006:123; Herbst and Sch\u00fcler 2008:6\u20137; Kim and Sells 2008:20; Carnie 2010:18; Sobin 2011:31; Carnie 2013:98.</ref>\n\n::Drunks could put off the customers.\n::(a) Who could put off the customers? - '''Drunks'''.\n::(b) Who could drunks put off? - '''The customers'''.\n::(c) What would drunks do? - '''Put off the customers'''.\n\nThese examples suggest that ''Drunks'', ''the customers'', and ''put off the customers'' are constituents in the test sentence. The answer fragment test is like most of the other tests for constituents in that it does not identify sub-phrasal strings as constituents:\n\n::(d) What about putting off the customers? - *'''Could'''.\n::(e) What could drunks do about the customers? - *'''Put'''.\n::(f) *What could drunks do about putting the customers? - *'''Off'''.\n::(g) *Who could drunks put off the? - *'''Customers'''.\n\nThese answer fragments are all grammatically unacceptable, suggesting that ''could'', ''put'', ''off'', and ''customers'' are not constituents. Note as well that the latter two questions themselves are ungrammatical. It is apparently often impossible to form the question in a way that could successfully elicit the indicated strings as answer fragments. The conclusion, then, is that the answer fragment test is like most of the other tests in that it fails to identify sub-phrasal strings as constituents.\n\n===Clefting===\n[[Clefting]] involves placing the test string X within the structure beginning with ''It is/was'': ''It was X that...''.<ref>For examples of clefting used as a test for constituents, see Brown and Miller 1980:25; Radford 1981:109\u201310; Aarts and Aarts 1982:97\u20138; Akmajian et al. 1990:150; Borsley 1991:23; Napoli 1993:148; McCawley 1998:64; Haegeman and Gu\u00e9ron 1999:49; B\u00f6rjars and Burridge 2001:27; Adger 2003:67; Sag et al. 2003:33; Tallerman 2005:127; Downing and Locke 2006:10; Haegeman 2006:85; Kim and Sells 2008:19; Carnie 2013: 98; Sportiche et al. 2014:70.</ref> The test string appears as the pivot of the cleft sentence:\n\n::Drunks could put off the customers.\n::(a) It is '''drunks''' that could put off the customers.\n::(b) It is '''the customers''' that drunks could put off.\n::(c) ??It is '''put off the customers''' that drunks could do.\n\nThese examples suggest that ''Drunks'' and ''the customers'' are constituents in the test sentence. Example c is of dubious acceptability, suggesting that ''put off the customers'' may not be constituent in the test string. Clefting is like most of the other tests for constituents in that it fails to identify most individual words as constituents:\n\n::(d) *It is '''could''' that drunks put off the customers.\n::(e) *It is '''put''' that drunks could off the customers.\n::(f) *It is '''off''' that drunks could put the customers.\n::(g) *It is '''the''' that drunks could put off customers. \n::(h) *It is '''customers''' that drunks could put off the.\n\nThe examples suggests that the each of the individual words ''could'', ''put'', ''off'', ''the'', and ''customers'' are not constituents, contrary to what most theories of syntax assume. In this respect, clefting is like many of the other tests for constituents in that it only succeeds at identifying certain phrasal strings as constituents.\n\n===VP-ellipsis (verb phrase ellipsis)===\nThe VP-ellipsis test checks to see which strings containing one or more predicative elements (usually verbs) can be elided from a sentence. Strings that can be elided are deemed constituents:<ref>For examples of VP-ellipsis used to test constituent structure, see Radford 1981:67, 1988:101; Napoli 1993:424; Ouhalla 1994:20; Radford 1997:110; McCawley 1998:67; Fromkin 2000:158; Adger 2003:65; Kroeger 2005:82; Tallerman 2005:141; Haegeman 2006:84\u20135; Payne 2006:163; Culicover 2009:80; Denham and Lobeck 2013:273\u20134; Sportiche et al. 2014:58\u201360.</ref> The symbol \u2205 is used in the following examples to mark the position of ellipsis:\n\n::Beggars could immediately put off the customers when they arrive, and \n::(a) *drunks could immediately also \u2205 the customers when they arrive. (\u2205 = '''put off''')\n::(b) ?drunks could immediately also \u2205 when they arrive. (\u2205 = '''put off the customers''') \n::(c) drunks could also \u2205 when they arrive. (\u2205 = '''immediately put off the customers''')\n::(d) drunks could immediately also \u2205. (\u2205 = '''put off the customers when they arrive''')\n::(e) drunks could also \u2205. (\u2205 = '''immediately put off the customers when they arrive''')\n\nThese examples suggest that ''put off'' is not a constituent in the test sentence, but that ''immediately put off the customers'', ''put off the customers when they arrive'', and ''immediately put off the customers when they arrive'' are constituents. Concerning the string ''put off the customers'' in (b), marginal acceptability makes it difficult to draw a conclusion about ''put off the customers''.\n\nThere are various difficulties associated with this test. The first of these is that it can identify too many constituents, such as in this case here where it is impossible to produce a single constituent structure that could simultaneously view each of the three acceptable examples (c-e) as having elided a constituent. Another problem is that the test can at times suggest that a discontinuous word combination is a constituent, e.g.:\n\n::(f) Frank will help tomorrow in the office, and Susan will \u2205 today. (\u2205 = '''help...in the office''')\n\nIn this case, it appears as though the elided material corresponds to the discontinuous word combination including ''help'' and ''in the office''.\n\n===Pseudoclefting===\nPseudoclefting is similar to clefting in that it puts emphasis on a certain phrase in a sentence. There are two variants of the pseudocleft test. One variant inserts the test string X in a sentence starting with a free relative clause: ''What.....is/are X''; the other variant inserts X at the start of the sentence followed by the ''it/are'' and then the free relative clause: ''X is/are what/who...'' Only the latter of these two variants is illustrated here.<ref>For examples of pseudoclefting used as a test for constituents, see Brown and Miller 1980:25; Aarts and Aarts 1982:98; Borsley 1991:24; Napoli 1993:168; McCawley 1998:64; Haegeman and Gu\u00e9ron 1999:50; Kroeger 2005:82; Downing and Locke 2006:10; Haegeman 2006:88; Payne 2006:160; Culicover 2009:89; Miller 2011:56; Carnie 2013:99; Sportiche et al. 2014:71.</ref>\n\n::Drunks would put off the customers.\n::(a) '''Drunks''' are who could put off the customers.\n::(b) '''The customers''' are who drunks could put off.\n::(c) '''Put off the customers''' is what drunks could do.\n\nThese examples suggest that ''Drunks'', ''the customers'', and ''put off the customers'' are constituents in the test sentence. Pseudoclefting fails to identify most individual words as constituents:\n\n::(d) *'''Could''' is what drunks put off the customers.\n::(e) *'''Put''' is what drunks could off the customers.\n::(f) *'''Off''' is what drunks could put the customers.\n::(g) *'''The''' is who drunks could put off customers.\n::(h) *'''Customers''' is who drunks could put of the.\n\nThe pseudoclefting test is hence like most of the other tests insofar as it identifies phrasal strings as constituents, but does not suggest that sub-phrasal strings are constituents.\n\n===Passivization===\nPassivization involves changing an active sentence to a passive sentence, or vice versa. The [[Object (grammar)|object]] of the active sentence is changed to the [[Subject (grammar)|subject]] of the corresponding passive sentence:<ref>For examples of passivization used as a test for constituents, see Brown and Miller 1980:25; Borsley 1991:24; Thomas 1993:10; Lobeck 2000:49\u201350; Downing and Locke 2006:10; Carnie 2010:21; Sobin 2011:30; Carnie 2013:99; Denham and Lobeck 2013:277.</ref>\n\n::(a) '''Drunks''' could put off '''the customers'''.\n::(b) '''The customers''' could be put off by '''drunks'''.\n\nThe fact that sentence (b), the passive sentence, is acceptable, suggests that ''Drunks'' and ''the customers'' are constituents in sentence (a). The passivization test used in this manner is only capable of identifying subject and object words, phrases, and clauses as constituents. It does not help identify other phrasal or sub-phrasal strings as constituents. In this respect, the value of passivization as test for constituents is very limited.\n\n===Omission (deletion)===\nOmission checks whether the target string can be omitted without influencing the grammaticality of the sentence. In most cases, local and temporal adverbials, attributive modifiers, and optional complements can be safely omitted and thus qualify as constituents.<ref>For examples of omission used as a test for constituents, see Allerton 1979: 113\u20139; Aarts and Aarts 1982: 60\u20131, 65\u20137; Burton\u2013Roberts 1997: 14\u20135; B\u00f6rjars and Burridge 2001: 33\u20134; Payne 2006: 163\u20135; Carnie 2010: 19; Hudson 2010: 147; Quirk et al. 2010: 41, 51, 61; Miller 2011: 54; Sobin 2011: 33).</ref>\n\n::Drunks could put off the customers.\n::(a) Drunks could put off customers. ('''''the''''' has been omitted.)\n\nThis sentence suggests that the definite article ''the'' is a constituent in the test sentence. Regarding the test sentence, however, the omission test is very limited in its ability to identify constituents, since the strings that one wants to check do not appear optionally. Therefore, the test sentence is adapted to better illustrate the omission test:\n\n::The '''obnoxious''' drunks could '''immediately''' put off the customers '''when they arrive'''.\n::(b) The drunks could immediately put off the customers when they arrive. ('''''obnoxious''''' has been successfully omitted.)\n::(c) The obnoxious drunks could put off the customers when they arrive. ('''''immediately''''' has been successfully omitted.)\n::(d) The obnoxious drunks could put off the customers. ('''''when they arrive''''' has been successfully omitted.)\n\nThe ability to omit ''obnoxious'', ''immediately'', and ''when they arrive'' suggests that these strings are constituents in the test sentence. Omission used in this manner is of limited applicability, since it is incapable of identifying any constituent that appears obligatorily. Hence there are many target strings that most accounts of sentence structure take to be constituents but that fail the omission test because these constituents appear obligatorily, such as subject phrases.\n\n===Intrusion===\nIntrusion probes sentence structure by having an adverb \"intrude\" into parts of the sentence. The idea is that the strings on either side of the adverb are constituents.<ref>For examples of intrusion used as a test for constituents, see Radford 1981:60\u20132; 1988:93; McCawley 1998:68\u201370; Fromkin 2000:147\u201351; B\u00f6rjars and Burridge 2001:34; Huddleston and Pullum 2002:21; Moravcsik 2006:123; Payne 2006:162.</ref>\n\n::Drunks could put off the customers.\n::(a) Drunks '''definitely''' could put off the customers.\n::(b) Drunks could '''definitely''' put off the customers.\n::(c) *Drunks could put '''definitely''' off the customers.\n::(d) *Drunks could put off '''definitely''' the customers.\n::(e) *Drunks could put off the '''definitely''' customers.\n\nExample (a) suggests that ''Drunks'' and ''could put off the customers'' are constituents. Example (b) suggests that ''Drunks could'' and ''put off the customers'' are constituents. The combination of (a) and (b) suggest in addition that ''could'' is a constituent. Sentence (c) suggests that ''Drunks could put'' and ''off the customers'' are not constituents. Example (d) suggests that ''Drunks could put off'' and ''the customers'' are not constituents. And example (e) suggests that ''Drunks could put off the'' and ''customers'' are not constituents.\n\nThose that employ the intrusion test usually use a modal adverb like ''definitely''. This aspect of the test is problematic, though, since the results of the test can vary based upon the choice of adverb. For instance, manner adverbs distribute differently than modal adverbs and will hence suggest a distinct constituent structure from that suggested by modal adverbs.\n\n===Wh-fronting===\nWh-fronting checks to see if the test string can be fronted as a wh-word.<ref>For examples of wh-fronting used as a test for constituents, see Radford 1981:108; Haegeman 1991:28; Haegeman and Gu\u00e9ron 1999:46\u20137; Lobeck 2000:57\u20139; Payne 2006:160; Culicover 2009:90\u20131; Denham and Lobeck 2013:279\u201381; Sportiche et al. 2014:58\u201360; M\u00fcller 2016:9.</ref> This test is similar to the answer fragment test insofar it employs just the first half of that test, disregarding the potential answer to the question.\n\n::Drunks would put off the customers.\n::(a) '''Who''' would put off the customers? (''Who \u2194 '''Drunks''''')\n::(b) '''Who''' would drunks put off? (''Who \u2194 '''the customers''''')\n::(c) '''What''' would drunks do? (''What...do \u2194 '''put off the customers''''')\n\nThese examples suggest that ''Drunks'', ''the customers'', and ''put off the customers'' are constituents in the test sentence. Wh-fronting is like a number of the other tests in that it fails to identify many subphrasal strings as constituents:\n\n::(d) *'''Do what''' drunks put off the customers? (''Do what \u2194 '''would''''')\n::(e) *'''Do what''' drunks would off the customers? (''Do what \u2194 '''put''''')\n::(f) *'''What''' would drunks put the customers? (''What \u2194 '''off''''')\n::(g) *'''What''' would drunks put off customers? (''What \u2194 '''the''''')\n::(h) *'''Who''' would drunks put off the? (''Who \u2194 '''customers''''')\n\nThese examples demonstrate a lack of evidence for viewing the individual words ''would'', ''put'', ''off'', ''the'', and ''customers'' as constituents.\n\n===General substitution===\nThe general substitution test replaces the test string with some other word or phrase.<ref>For examples of the general substitution test, see Allerton 1979: 113; Brown and Miller 1980: 38; Aarts and Aarts 1982: 11; Radford 1988: 89\u201391; Moravcsik 2006: 123\u20134; Culicover 2009: 37; Quirk et al. 2010: 41; M\u00fcller 2016: 7\u20138.</ref> It is similar to proform substitution, the only difference being that the replacement word or phrase is not a proform, e.g. \n::Drunks could put off the customers.\n::(a) '''Beggars''' could put off the customers. (Beggars \u2194 '''Drunks''')\n::(b) Drunks could put off '''our guests'''. (our guests \u2194 '''the customers''')\n::(c) Drunks '''would''' put off the customers. (would \u2194 '''could''')\nThese examples suggest that the strings ''Drunks'', ''the customers'', and ''could'' are constituents in the test sentence. There is a major problem with this test, for it is easily possible to find a replacement word for strings that the other tests suggest are clearly not constituents, e.g. \n::(d) Drunks '''piss''' off the customers. (piss \u2194 '''could put''')\n::(e) '''Beggars''' put off the customers. (Beggars \u2194 '''Drunks could''')\n::(f) Drunks '''like''' customers. (like \u2194 '''could put off the''')\nThese examples suggest that ''could put'', ''Drunks could'', and ''could put of the'' are constituents in the test sentence. This is contrary to what the other tests reveal and to what most theories of sentence structure assume. The value of general substitution as test for constituents is therefore suspect. It is like the coordination test in that it suggests that too many strings are constituents.\n\n===Right node raising (RNR)===\n[[Right node raising]], abbreviated as RNR, is a test that isolates the test string on the right side of a coordinate structure.<ref>For examples of RNR used as test for constituents, see Radford 1988: 77\u20138, 97; Radford 1997: 106; McCawley 1998: 60\u20131; Haegeman and Gu\u00e9ron 1999: 52, 77; Sportiche et al. 2014: 67\u20138.</ref> The assumption is that only constituents can be shared by the conjuncts of a coordinate structure, e.g.\n::Drunks could put off the customers.\n::(a) [Drunks] and [beggars] '''could put off the customers'''.\n::(b) [Drunks could], and [they probably would], '''put off the customers'''. \n::(c) [Drunks could approach] and [they would then put off] '''the customers'''.\nThese examples suggest that ''could put off the customers'', ''put off the customers'', and ''the customers'' are constituents in the test sentence. There are two problems with the RNR diagnostic as a test for constituents. The first is that it is limited in its applicability, since it is only capable of identifying strings as constituents if they appear on the right side of the test sentence. The second is that it can suggest strings to be constituents that most of the other tests suggest are not constituents. To illustrate this point, a different example must be used:\n::Frank has given his bicycle to us to use if need be. \n::(d) [Frank has offered], and [Susan has already loaned], '''their bicycles to us to use if need be'''. \n::(e) [Frank has offered his bicycle] and [Susan has already loaned her bicycle] '''to us to use if need be'''.\n::(f) [Frank has offered his bicycle to us] and [Susan has already loaned her bicycle to us] '''to use if need be'''.\nThese examples suggest that ''their bicycles (his bicycle) to us to use if need be'', ''to us to use if need be'', and ''to use if need be'' are constituents in the test sentence. Most theories of syntax do not view these strings as constituents, and more importantly, most of the other tests suggest that they are not constituents.\nIn short, these tests are not taken for granted because a constituent may pass one test and fail to pass many others. We need to consult our intuitive thinking when judging the constituency of any set of words.\n@shams\n\n==Tests grouped in terms of how they test for the constituent ==\nConstituency tests can be organized into three broad categories to manipulate sentence structure, namely substitution, displacement, and deletion. Substitution tests include: general substitution, coordination, proform substitution, VP substitution (with do so), and NP substitution (with one). Displacement tests include: topicalization, clefting, pseudo-clefting, wh-fronting, right node raising, passivization, and intrusion. Deletion tests include: ellipsis and answer-fragments. Consider the following example:<blockquote>''Dogs will always chase cats.''</blockquote>In this sentence, dogs and cats are nouns, will is a modal verb, always is an adverb, and chase is a main verb. This sentence contains a transitive verb, which takes two arguments; the doer of the action, called the agent, and the recipient, called the theme.\n\n=== Substitution tests ===\nSubstitution tests evaluate constituency by replacing a relevant word, or string of words, with another constituent of the same category. The substitutions of interest replace a substring with a word, where that word plays the same kind of role in the sentence as the original sub-string did. \n\n==== Coordination ====\nCoordination is a type of substitution test that tests for constituency. Using and, or, and but are the simplest ways to tell that natural language is recursive. If a string S can be coordinated with a word, or phrase of the same type, then S is hypothesized to be a constituent.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Sportiche, Dominique.|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/861536792|title=An introduction to syntactic analysis and theory|others=Koopman, Hilda Judith., Stabler, Edward P.|isbn=978-1-118-47048-0|location=Hoboken|oclc=861536792}}</ref> Consider the following examples:\n\n# [<sub>DP</sub> '''Dogs and eagles'''] will always chase cats.\n# Dogs will always chase [<sub>DP</sub> '''cats or birds'''].\n# Dogs will [<sub>AdvP</sub> '''always and only'''] chase cats.\n# Dogs [<sub>TP</sub> '''will and should'''] always chase cats.\n# Dogs will always [<sub>VP</sub> '''chase and bite'''] cats.\n# Dogs will always chase cats [<sub>PP</sub> '''down the hill and to the store'''].\n# Dogs will always chase cats [<sub>CP</sub> '''if they are playful and if they are sociable'''].\n\nHowever, the sentences become ungrammatical when the sequences of words coordinated are not of the same syntactic category.\n\n8. * Dogs will always [<sub>VP</sub> '''chase cats and down the hill'''].\n\nFrom the diagnostics, it can be determined that only constituents of the same syntactic category can be coordinated. The ill-formed sentence is marked with an asterisk, since down the hill is a PP, whereas cats is an NP, and therefore is not compliant with this test.\n\n==== '''Do so substitution''' ====\nDo so substitution is a type of substitution test that tests for constituency by replacing a VP with do so. If a string S can be substituted for do so, then S is hypothesized to be a VP constituent. Consider the following examples:\n\n# Dogs will [always chase cats], and eagles will [<sub>VP</sub> '''do so'''] too.\n# Dogs will always [chase cats], but eagles will never [<sub>VP</sub> '''do so'''].\n\nHowever, the sentences become ungrammatical when the words do so are replaced by for a non-VP.\n\n3. * Dogs will always chase [<sub>DP</sub> '''do so'''].\n\nFrom the diagnostics, we know that by using the test we can determine which sequences of words are VP constituents. The first two sentences substitute do so for different VPs. In the first example, do so replaces the entire VP, but in the second, do so replaces the verb and excludes the adverb. The ill-formed sentence is marked with an asterisk, since cats is an DP, and therefore not compliant with this test.\n\n==== '''One substitution''' ====\nOne substitution is a type of Substitution test that tests for constituency by replacing the indefinite pronoun one for an NP. If a string S can be replaced by one, then S is hypothesized to be a NP constituent. Consider the following examples:\n\n1. Dogs will always chase that black [<sub>NP</sub> '''one'''].\n\n2. This [<sub>NP</sub> '''one'''] will always chase cats.\n\nHowever, the sentences become ungrammatical one is replaced with a non-NP.\n\n3. # [<sub>NP</sub> '''One'''] will always chase cats. \n\n4. * Dogs [<sub>NP</sub> '''one'''] always chase cats.\n\n5. * Dogs will always [<sub>NP</sub> '''one'''] cats.\n\nFrom the diagnostics, we know that the indefinite pronoun one must replace an NP. The ill-formed sentences are marked with an asterisk, since VPs and TPs are not compliant with this test. The third example is marked with a hashtag, signifying its grammatical well-formedness but inappropriate context. Here, one can refer to any living thing, but the meaning dogs can never be recovered.\n\n=== Displacement tests ===\nDisplacement tests include: topicalization, clefting, pseudo-clefting, wh-fronting, right node raising, passivization, and intrusion.\n\n=== Deletion tests ===\nDeletion tests include ellipsis and answer-fragments.\n\n==Other languages==\nA word of caution is warranted concerning the tests for constituents as just discussed above. These tests are found in textbooks on linguistics and syntax that are written mainly with the syntax of English in mind, and the examples that are discussed are mainly from English. The tests may or may not be valid and useful when probing the constituent structure of other languages. Ideally, a battery of tests for constituents can and should be developed for each language, catered to the idiosyncrasies of the language at hand.\n\n==Competing theories==\nConstituent structure analyses of sentences are a central concern for theories of syntax. The one theory can produce an analysis of constituent structure that is quite unlike the next. This point is evident with the two tree diagrams above of the sentence ''Drunks could put off the customers'', where the dependency grammar analysis of constituent structure looks very much unlike the phrase structure analysis. The crucial difference across the two analyses is that the phrase structure analysis views every individual word as a constituent by default, whereas the dependency grammar analysis sees only those individual words as constituents that do not dominate other words. Phrase structure grammars therefore acknowledge many more constituents than dependency grammars.\n\nA second example further illustrates this point (D = determiner, N = noun, NP = noun phrase, Pa = particle, S = sentence, V = Verb, V' = verb-bar, VP = verb phrase):\n\n[[File:Constituents (linguistics) picture 1.png|500px]]\n\nThe dependency grammar tree shows five words and word combinations as constituents: ''who'', ''these'', ''us'', ''these diagrams'', and ''show us''. The phrase structure tree, in contrast, shows nine words and word combinations as constituents: ''what'', ''do'', ''these'', ''diagrams'', ''show'', ''us'', ''these diagrams'', ''show us'', and ''do these diagrams show us''. The two diagrams thus disagree concerning the status of ''do'', ''diagrams'', ''show'',  and ''do these diagrams show us'', the phrase structure diagram showing them as constituents and the dependency grammar diagram showing them as non-constituents. To determine which analysis is more plausible, one turns to the tests for constituents discussed above.<ref>For a comparison of these two competing views of constituent structure, see Osborne (2019:73-94).</ref>\n\nWithin phrase structure grammars, views about of constituent structure can also vary significantly. Many modern phrase structure grammars assume that syntactic branching is always binary, that is, each greater constituent is necessarily broken down into two lesser constituents. More dated phrase structures analyses are, however, more likely to allow n-ary branching, that is, each greater constituent can be broken down into one, two, or more lesser constituents. The next two trees illustrate the distinction (Aux = auxiliary verb, AuxP = auxiliary verb phrase, Aux' = Aux-bar, D = determiner, N = noun, NP = noun phrase, P = preposition, PP = prepositional phrase, Pa = particle, S = sentence, t = trace, V = Verb, V' = verb-bar, VP = verb phrase):\n\n[[File:Constituent (linguistics) 3.png|500px]]\n\nThe details in the second diagram here not crucial to the point at hand. This point is that the all branching there is strictly binary, whereas in the first tree diagram ternary branching is present twice, for the AuxP and for the VP. Observe in this regard that strictly binary branching analyses increase the number of (overt) constituents to what is possible. The word combinations ''have sent many things to us'' and ''many things to us'' are shown as constituents in the second tree diagram but not in the first. Which of these two analyses is better is again at least in part a matter of what the tests for constituents can reveal.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Catena (linguistics)]]\n*[[Finite verb]]\n*[[Non-finite verb]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*Adger, D. 2003.

The constituent structure of sentences is identified using ''tests for constituents''.<ref>Osborne (2018) provides a detailed and comprehensive discussion of tests for constituents, having surveyed dozens of textbooks on the topic. Osborne's article is available here: [http://www.ludjournal.org/index.php?journal=LUD&page=article&op=view&path%5B%5D=59 Tests for constituents: What they really reveal about the nature of syntactic structure]. See also Osborne (2019: 2-6, 73-94).</ref>  These tests apply to a portion of a sentence, and  the results provide evidence about the constituent structure of the sentence. Many constituents are [[phrase]]s. A phrase is a sequence of one or more words (in some theories two or more) built around a [[head (linguistics)|head]] lexical item and working as a unit within a sentence. A word sequence is shown to be a phrase/constituent if it exhibits one or more of the behaviors discussed below. The analysis of constituent structure is associated mainly with [[phrase structure grammar]]s, although [[dependency grammar]]s also allow sentence structure to be broken down into constituent parts.\n\nConstituency tests can be grouped in one of two ways, namely in terms of how widely used they are (i.e. their relative frequency) or in terms of which constituent they test for.\n\n==Tests grouped by how commonly they are used in English==\nTests for constituents are diagnostics used to identify sentence structure. There are numerous tests for constituents that are commonly used to identify the constituents of English sentences. 15 of the most commonly used tests are listed next: 1) [[coordination (linguistics)|coordination]] (conjunction), 2) pro-form substitution (replacement), 3) [[topicalization]] (fronting), 4) ''do-so''-substitution, 5) ''one''-substitution, 6) [[answer ellipsis]] (question test), 7) [[Cleft sentence|clefting]], 8) VP-ellipsis, 9) pseudoclefting, 10) passivization, 11) omission (deletion), 12) intrusion, 13) wh-fronting, 14) general substitution, 15) [[right node raising]] (RNR).\n\nThe order in which these 15 tests are listed here corresponds to the frequency of use, coordination being the most frequently used of the 15 tests and RNR being the least frequently used. A general word of caution is warranted when employing these tests, since they often deliver contradictory results. The tests are merely rough-and-ready tools that grammarians employ to reveal clues about syntactic structure. Some syntacticians even arrange the tests on a scale of reliability, with less-reliable tests treated as useful to confirm constituency though not sufficient on their own. Failing to pass a single test does not mean that the test string is not a constituent, and conversely, passing a single test does not necessarily mean the test string is a constituent. It is best to apply as many tests as possible to a given string in order to prove or to rule out its status as a constituent.\n\nThe 15 tests are introduced, discussed, and illustrated below mainly relying on the same one sentence:<ref>This one sentence has been adapted slightly from Radford 1988:91. Radford uses this sentence to introduce and illustrate sentence structure and tests for constituents that identify this structure.</ref>\n\n::'''Drunks could put off the customers'''.\n\nBy restricting the introduction and discussion of the tests for constituents below mainly to this one sentence, it becomes possible to compare the results of the tests. To aid the discussion and illustrations of the constituent structure of this sentence, the following two sentence diagrams are employed (D = determiner, N = noun, NP = noun phrase, Pa = particle, S = sentence, V = Verb,  VP = verb phrase): \n \n[[File:Competing sentence diagrams.png|Two potential analyses of constituent structure|500px]]\n\nThese diagrams show two potential analyses of the constituent structure of the sentence. A given node in a tree diagram is understood as marking a constituent, that is, a constituent is understood as corresponding to a given node and everything that that node exhaustively dominates. Hence the first tree, which shows the constituent structure according to [[dependency grammar]], marks the following words and word combinations as constituents: ''Drunks'', ''off'', ''the'', ''the customers'', and ''put off the customers''.<ref>Two prominent sources on dependency grammar are Tesni\u00e8re (1959) and \u00c1gel, et al. (2003/2006).</ref> The second tree, which shows the constituent structure according to [[phrase structure|phrase structure grammar]], marks the following words and word combinations as constituents: ''Drunks'', ''could'', ''put'', ''off'', ''the'', ''customers'', ''the customers'', ''put off the customers'', and ''could put off the customers''. The analyses in these two tree diagrams provide orientation for the discussion of tests for constituents that now follows.\n\n===Coordination===\nThe [[coordination (linguistics)|coordination]] test assumes that only constituents can be coordinated, i.e., joined by means of a coordinator such as ''and'', ''or'', or ''but'':<ref>For examples of coordination used as a test for constituent structure, see Baker 1978:269\u201376; Radford 1981:59\u201360; Atkinson et al. 1982:172\u20133; Radford 1988:75\u20138; Akmajian et al. 1990:152\u20133; Borsley 1991:25\u201330; Cowper 1992:34\u20137; Napoli 1993:159\u201361; Ouhalla 1994:17; Radford 1997:104\u20137; Burton\u2013Roberts 1997:66\u201370; Haegeman and Gu\u00e9ron 1999:27; Fromkin 2000:160\u20132; Lasnik 2000:11; Lobeck 2000:61\u20133; B\u00f6rjars and Burridge 2001:27\u201331; Huddleston and Pullum 2002:1348\u20139; van Valin 2001:113\u20134; Poole 2002:31\u20132; Adger 2003:125\u20136; Sag et al. 2003:30; Radford 2004:70\u20131; Kroeger 2005:91, 218\u20139; Tallerman 2005:144\u20136; Haegeman 2006:89\u201392; Payne 2006:162; Kim and Sells 2008:22; Carnie 2010:115\u20136, 125; Quirk et al. 2010:46\u20137; Sobin 2011:31\u20132; Carnie 2013:99\u2013100; Sportiche et al. 2014:62\u20138; M\u00fcller 2016:10, 16\u20137</ref> The next examples demonstrate that coordination identifies individual words as constituents:\n\n::Drunks could put off the customers.\n::(a) ['''Drunks'''] and [bums] could put off the customers.\n::(b) Drunks ['''could'''] and [would] put off the customers.\n::(c) Drunks could ['''put off'''] and [drive away] the customers.\n::(d) Drunks could put off the ['''customers'''] and [neighbors].\n\nThe square brackets mark the conjuncts of the coordinate structures. Based on these data, one might assume that ''drunks'', ''could'', ''put off'', and ''customers'' are constituents in the test sentence because these strings can be coordinated with ''bums'', ''would'', ''drive away'', and ''neighbors'', respectively. Coordination also identifies multi-word strings as constituents:\n\n::(e) Drunks could put off ['''the customers'''] and [the neighbors].\n::(f) Drunks could ['''put off the customers'''] and [drive away the neighbors].\n::(g) Drunks ['''could put off the customers'''] and [would drive away the neighbors].\n\nThese data suggest that ''the customers'',  ''put off the customers'', and ''could put off the customers'' are constituents in the test sentence.\n\nExamples such as (a-g) are not controversial insofar as many theories of sentence structure readily view the strings tested in sentences (a-g) as constituents. However, additional data are problematic, since they suggest that certain strings are also constituents even though most theories of syntax do not acknowledge them as such, e.g.\n\n::(h) Drunks ['''could put off'''] and [would really annoy] the customers. \n::(i) Drunks could ['''put off these'''] and [piss off those] customers. \n::(j) ['''Drunks could'''], and [they probably would], put off the customers.\n\nThese data suggest that ''could put off'', ''put off these'', and ''Drunks could'' are constituents in the test sentence. Most theories of syntax reject the notion that these strings are constituents, though. Data such as (h-j) are sometimes addressed in terms of the [[right node raising]] (RNR) mechanism.\n\nThe problem for the coordination test represented by examples (h-j) is compounded when one looks beyond the test sentence, for one quickly finds that coordination suggests that a wide range of strings are constituents that most theories of syntax do not acknowledge as such, e.g.\n\n::(k) Sam leaves ['''from home on Tuesday'''] and [from work on Wednesday].\n::(l) Sam leaves ['''from home on Tuesday on his bicycle'''] and [from work on Wednesday in his car].\n::(m) Sam leaves ['''from home on Tuesday'''], and [from work].\n\nThe strings ''from home on Tuesday'' and ''from home on Tuesday on his bicycle'' are not viewed as constituents in most theories of syntax, and concerning sentence (m), it is very difficult there to even discern how one should delimit the conjuncts of the coordinate structure. The coordinate structures in (k-l) are sometimes characterized in terms of non-constituent conjuncts (NCC), and the instance of coordination in sentence (m) is sometimes discussed in terms of stripping and/or [[gapping]].\n\nDue to the difficulties suggested with examples (h-m), many grammarians view coordination skeptically regarding its value as a test for constituents. The discussion of the other tests for constituents below reveals that this skepticism is warranted, since coordination identifies many more strings as constituents than the other tests for constituents.<ref>The problems with coordination as a test for constituent structure have been pointed out in numerous places in the literature.

Substitution normally involves using a definite proform like ''it'', ''he'', ''there'', ''here'', etc. in place of a phrase or a clause. If such a change yields a grammatical sentence where the general structure has not been altered, then the test string is likely a constituent:<ref>For examples of pro-form substitution used as a test for constituents, see Allerton 1979:113\u20134; Radford 1981:63\u20136; Atkinson et al 1982:173\u20134; Radford 1988:78\u201381, 98\u20139; Thomas 1993:10\u201312; Napoli 1993:168; Ouhalla 1994:19; Radford 1997:109; Haegeman and Gu\u00e9ron 1999:46; Fromkin 2000:155\u20138; Lasnik 2000:9\u201310; Lobeck 2000:53\u20137; B\u00f6rjars and Burridge 2001:24\u20135; van Valin 2001: 111\u20132; Poole 2002:29\u201331; Adger 2003:63; Radford 2004:71; Tallerman 2005:140\u20132; Haegeman 2006:74\u20139; Moravcsik 2006:123; Kim and Sells 2008:21\u20132; Culicover 2009:81; Carnie 2010:19\u201320; Quirk et al. 2010:75\u20137; Miller 2011:54\u20135; Sobin 2011:32; Carnie 2013:98; Denham and Lobeck 2013:262\u20135; Sportiche et al. 2014:50; M\u00fcller 2016:8.</ref>\n\n::Drunks could put off the customers.\n::(a) '''They''' could put off the customers. (''They = '''Drunks''''')\n::(b) Drunks could put '''them''' off. (''them = '''the customers'''''; note that shifting of ''them'' and ''off'' has occurred here.)\n::(c) Drunks could '''do it'''. (''do it = '''put off the customers''''')\n\nThese examples suggest that ''Drunks'', ''the customers'', and ''put off the customers'' in the test sentence are constituents. An important aspect of the proform test is the fact that it fails to identify most subphrasal strings as constituents, e.g.\n\n::(d) *Drunks '''do so/it''' put off the customers (''do so/it = could'')\n::(e) *Drunks could '''do so/it''' off the customers (''do so/it = put'')\n::(f) *Drunks could put '''so/it''' the customers (''so/it = off'')\n::(g) *Drunks could put off the '''them'''. (''them = customers'')\n\nThese examples suggest that the individual words ''could'', ''put'', ''off'', and ''customers'' should not be viewed as constituents. This suggestion is of course controversial, since most theories of syntax assume that individual words are constituents by default. The conclusion one can reach based on such examples, however, is that proform substitution using a definite proform identifies phrasal constituents only; it fails to identify sub-phrasal strings as constituents.\n\n===Topicalization (fronting)===\n[[Topicalization]] involves moving the test string to the front of the sentence. It is a simple movement operation.<ref>For examples of topicalization used as a test for constituents, see Allerton 1979:114; Atkinson et al. 1982:171\u20132; Radford 1988:95; Borsley 1991:24; Haegeman 1991:27; Napoli 1993:422; Ouhalla 1994:20; Burton\u2013Roberts 1997:17\u20138; Haegeman and Gu\u00e9ron 1999:46; Fromkin 2000:151; Lasnik 2000:10; Lobeck 2000:47\u20139; B\u00f6rjars and Burridge 2001:26; van Valin 2001:112; Poole 2002:32; Adger 2003:65; Sag et al. 2003:33; Radford 2004:72; Kroeger 2005:31; Downing and Locke 2006:10; Haegeman 2006:79; Payne 2006:160; Culicover 2009:84; Quirk et al. 2010:51; Miller 2011:55; Sobin 2011:31; Sportiche et al. 2014:68; M\u00fcller 2016:10.</ref> Many instances of topicalization seem only marginally acceptable when taken out of context. Hence to suggest a context, an instance of topicalization can be preceded by ''...and'' and a modal adverb can be added as well (e.g. ''certainly''):\n\n::Drunks could put off the customers.\n::(a) ...and '''the customers''', drunks certainly could put off.\n::(b) ...and '''put off the customers''', drunks certainly could.\n\nThese examples suggest that ''the customers'' and ''put off the customers'' are constituents in the test sentence. Topicalization is like many of the other tests in that it identifies phrasal constituents only. When the test sequence is a sub-phrasal string, topicalization fails:\n\n::(c) *...and '''customers''', drunks certainly could put off the.\n::(d) *...and '''could''', drunks certainly put off the customers.\n::(e) *...and '''put''', drunks certainly could off the customers.\n::(f) *...and '''off''', drunks certainly could put the customers.\n::(g) *...and '''the''', drunks certainly could put off customers.\n\nThese examples demonstrate that ''customers'', ''could'', ''put'', ''off'', and ''the'' fail the topicalization test. Since these strings are all sub-phrasal, one can conclude that topicalization is unable to identify sub-phrasal strings as constituents.\n\n===''Do-so''-substitution===\n''Do-so''-substitution is a test that substitutes a form of ''do so'' (''does so'', ''did so'', ''done so'', ''doing so'') into the test sentence for the target string. This test is widely used to probe the structure of strings containing verbs (because ''do'' is a verb).<ref>For examples of the use of ''do-so''-substitution as a test for constituents, see Baker 1978:261\u20138; Aarts and Aarts 1982:56, Atkinson et al. 1982:174; Borsley 1991:63; Haegeman 1991:79\u201382; Cowper 1992:31; Napoli 1993:423\u20135; Burton\u2013Roberts 1997:104\u20137; Haegeman and Gu\u00e9ron 1999:74; Fromkin 2000:156\u20137; van Valin 2001:123, 127; Poole 2002:41\u20133; Tallerman 2005:130\u20131, 141; Haegeman 2006:75\u20136; Payne 2006:162; Culicover 2009:81; Carnie 2010:115\u20136; Quirk et al. 2010:76, 82; Miller 2011:54\u20135; Sobin 2011:33; Carnie 2013:169\u201370; Denham and Lobeck 2013:265; Sportiche et al. 2014:61.</ref> The test is limited in its applicability, though, precisely because it is only applicable to strings containing verbs:\n\n::Drunks could put off the customers.\n::(a) Drunks could '''do so'''. (''do so = '''put off the customers''''')\n::(b) Drunks '''do so'''. (''do so \u2260 '''could put off the customers''''')\n\nThe 'a' example suggests that ''put off the customers'' is a constituent in the test sentence, whereas the b example fails to suggest that ''could put off the customers'' is a constituent, for ''do so'' cannot include the meaning of the modal verb ''could''. To illustrate more completely how the ''do so'' test is employed, another test sentence is now used, one that contains two post-verbal adjunct phrases:\n\n::We met them in the pub because we had time.   \n::(c) We '''did so''' in the pub because we had time. (''did so = '''met them''''')\n::(d) We '''did so''' because we had time. (''did so = '''met them in the pub''''')\n::(e) We '''did so'''. (''did so = '''met them in the pub because we had time''''')\n\nThese data suggest that ''met them'', ''met them in the pub'', and ''met them in the pub because we had time'' are constituents in the test sentence. Taken together, such examples seem to motivate a structure for the test sentence that has a left-branching verb phrase, because only a left-branching verb phrase can view each of the indicated strings as a constituent. There is a problem with this sort of reasoning, however, as the next example illustrates:\n\n::(f) We '''did so''' in the pub. (''did so = '''met them because we had time''''')\n\nIn this case, ''did so'' appears to stand in for the discontinuous word combination consisting of ''met them'' and ''because we had time''. Such a discontinuous combination of words cannot be construed as a constituent. That such an interpretation of ''did so'' is indeed possible is seen in a fuller sentence such as ''You met them in the cafe because you had time, and we did so in the pub''. In this case, the preferred reading of ''did so'' is that it indeed simultaneously stands in for both ''met them'' and ''because we had time''.\n\n===''One''-substitution===\nThe ''one''-substitution test replaces the test string with the indefinite pronoun ''one'' or ''ones''.<ref>For examples of ''one''-substitution used as a test for constituents, see Baker 1978:327\u201340, 413\u201325; Radford 1981:92, 96\u2013100; Aarts and Aarts 1982:57; Haegeman 1991: 26, 88\u20139; Cowper 1992:26; Napoli 1993:423\u20135; Burton\u2013Roberts 1997:182\u20139; McCawley 1998:183; Haegeman and Gu\u00e9ron 1999:75\u20136; Fromkin 2000: 157\u20138; van Valin 2001:122, 126, 128, Poole 2002:37\u20139; Adger 2003:63; Radford 2004:37; Kroeger 2005:97\u20138; Tallerman 2005:150; Haegeman 2006:109; Carnie 2010:114\u20135; Quirk et al. 2010:75; Carnie 2013:166\u20137; Sportiche et al. 2014:52, 57, 60.</ref> If the result is acceptable, then the test string is deemed a constituent. Since ''one'' is a type of pronoun, ''one''-substitution is only of value when probing the structure of noun phrases. In this regard, the test sentence from above is expanded in order to better illustrate the manner in which one-substitution is generally employed:\n\n::Drunks could put off the loyal customers around here who we rely on.\n::(a) Drunks could put off the loyal '''ones''' around here who we rely on. (ones = '''''customers''''')\n::(b) Drunks could put off the '''ones''' around here who we rely on. (''ones = '''loyal customers''''')\n::(c) Drunks could put off the loyal '''ones''' who we rely on. (''ones = '''customers around here''''')\n::(d) Drunks could put off the '''ones''' who we rely on. (''ones = '''loyal customers around here''''')\n::(e) Drunks could put off the loyal '''ones'''. (''ones = '''customers around here who we rely on''''')\n\nThese examples suggest that ''customers'', ''loyal customers'', ''customers around here'', ''loyal customers around here'', and ''customers around here who we rely on'' are constituents in the test sentence. Some have pointed to a problem associated with the ''one''-substitution in this area, however. This problem is that it is impossible to produce a single constituent structure of the noun phrase ''the loyal customers around here who we rely on'' that could simultaneous view all of the indicated strings as constituents.<ref>Concerning the inability of a single constituent structure to simultaneously acknowledge all of the strings that ''one''-substitution suggests are constituents, see Cowper 1992:30, Napoli 1993: 425, Burton-Roberts 1997: 187, and Carnie 2013: 190\u20132.</ref> Another problem that has been pointed out concerning the ''one''-substitution as a test for constituents is the fact that it at times suggests that non-string word combinations are constituents,<ref>The fact that one-substitution at times suggests that non-string word combinations are constituents is illustrated and discussed by Culicover and Jackendoff 2005:136\u20139 and Goldberg and Michaelis 2017:4\u20136.</ref> e.g.\n\n::(f) Drunks would put off the '''ones''' around here. (''ones = '''loyal customers who we rely on''')\n\nThe word combination consisting of both ''loyal customers'' and ''who we rely on'' is discontinuous in the test sentence, a fact that should motivate one to generally question the value of ''one''-substitution as a test for constituents.\n\n===Answer fragments (answer ellipsis, question test, standalone test)===\nThe answer fragment test involves forming a question that contains a single wh-word (e.g. ''who'', ''what'', ''where'', etc.). If the test string can then appear alone as the answer to such a question, then it is likely a constituent in the test sentence:<ref>For examples of answer fragments used as a test for constituents, see Brown and Miller 1980:25; Radford 1981:72, 92; Radford 1988:91; Burton\u2013Roberts 1997:15\u20138; Radford 1997:107; B\u00f6rjars and Burridge 2001:25; Kroeger 2005:31; Tallerman 2005:125; Downing and Locke 2006:10; Haegeman 2006:82; Moravcsik 2006:123; Herbst and Sch\u00fcler 2008:6\u20137; Kim and Sells 2008:20; Carnie 2010:18; Sobin 2011:31; Carnie 2013:98.</ref>\n\n::Drunks could put off the customers.\n::(a) Who could put off the customers? - '''Drunks'''.\n::(b) Who could drunks put off? - '''The customers'''.\n::(c) What would drunks do? - '''Put off the customers'''.\n\nThese examples suggest that ''Drunks'', ''the customers'', and ''put off the customers'' are constituents in the test sentence. The answer fragment test is like most of the other tests for constituents in that it does not identify sub-phrasal strings as constituents:\n\n::(d) What about putting off the customers? - *'''Could'''.\n::(e) What could drunks do about the customers? - *'''Put'''.\n::(f) *What could drunks do about putting the customers? - *'''Off'''.\n::(g) *Who could drunks put off the? - *'''Customers'''.\n\nThese answer fragments are all grammatically unacceptable, suggesting that ''could'', ''put'', ''off'', and ''customers'' are not constituents. Note as well that the latter two questions themselves are ungrammatical. It is apparently often impossible to form the question in a way that could successfully elicit the indicated strings as answer fragments. The conclusion, then, is that the answer fragment test is like most of the other tests in that it fails to identify sub-phrasal strings as constituents.\n\n===Clefting===\n[[Clefting]] involves placing the test string X within the structure beginning with ''It is/was'': ''It was X that...''.<ref>For examples of clefting used as a test for constituents, see Brown and Miller 1980:25; Radford 1981:109\u201310; Aarts and Aarts 1982:97\u20138; Akmajian et al. 1990:150; Borsley 1991:23; Napoli 1993:148; McCawley 1998:64; Haegeman and Gu\u00e9ron 1999:49; B\u00f6rjars and Burridge 2001:27; Adger 2003:67; Sag et al. 2003:33; Tallerman 2005:127; Downing and Locke 2006:10; Haegeman 2006:85; Kim and Sells 2008:19; Carnie 2013: 98; Sportiche et al. 2014:70.</ref> The test string appears as the pivot of the cleft sentence:\n\n::Drunks could put off the customers.\n::(a) It is '''drunks''' that could put off the customers.\n::(b) It is '''the customers''' that drunks could put off.\n::(c) ??It is '''put off the customers''' that drunks could do.\n\nThese examples suggest that ''Drunks'' and ''the customers'' are constituents in the test sentence. Example c is of dubious acceptability, suggesting that ''put off the customers'' may not be constituent in the test string. Clefting is like most of the other tests for constituents in that it fails to identify most individual words as constituents:\n\n::(d) *It is '''could''' that drunks put off the customers.\n::(e) *It is '''put''' that drunks could off the customers.\n::(f) *It is '''off''' that drunks could put the customers.\n::(g) *It is '''the''' that drunks could put off customers. \n::(h) *It is '''customers''' that drunks could put off the.\n\nThe examples suggests that the each of the individual words ''could'', ''put'', ''off'', ''the'', and ''customers'' are not constituents, contrary to what most theories of syntax assume. In this respect, clefting is like many of the other tests for constituents in that it only succeeds at identifying certain phrasal strings as constituents.\n\n===VP-ellipsis (verb phrase ellipsis)===\nThe VP-ellipsis test checks to see which strings containing one or more predicative elements (usually verbs) can be elided from a sentence. Strings that can be elided are deemed constituents:<ref>For examples of VP-ellipsis used to test constituent structure, see Radford 1981:67, 1988:101; Napoli 1993:424; Ouhalla 1994:20; Radford 1997:110; McCawley 1998:67; Fromkin 2000:158; Adger 2003:65; Kroeger 2005:82; Tallerman 2005:141; Haegeman 2006:84\u20135; Payne 2006:163; Culicover 2009:80; Denham and Lobeck 2013:273\u20134; Sportiche et al. 2014:58\u201360.</ref> The symbol \u2205 is used in the following examples to mark the position of ellipsis:\n\n::Beggars could immediately put off the customers when they arrive, and \n::(a) *drunks could immediately also \u2205 the customers when they arrive. (\u2205 = '''put off''')\n::(b) ?drunks could immediately also \u2205 when they arrive. (\u2205 = '''put off the customers''') \n::(c) drunks could also \u2205 when they arrive. (\u2205 = '''immediately put off the customers''')\n::(d) drunks could immediately also \u2205. (\u2205 = '''put off the customers when they arrive''')\n::(e) drunks could also \u2205. (\u2205 = '''immediately put off the customers when they arrive''')\n\nThese examples suggest that ''put off'' is not a constituent in the test sentence, but that ''immediately put off the customers'', ''put off the customers when they arrive'', and ''immediately put off the customers when they arrive'' are constituents. Concerning the string ''put off the customers'' in (b), marginal acceptability makes it difficult to draw a conclusion about ''put off the customers''.\n\nThere are various difficulties associated with this test. The first of these is that it can identify too many constituents, such as in this case here where it is impossible to produce a single constituent structure that could simultaneously view each of the three acceptable examples (c-e) as having elided a constituent. Another problem is that the test can at times suggest that a discontinuous word combination is a constituent, e.g.:\n\n::(f) Frank will help tomorrow in the office, and Susan will \u2205 today. (\u2205 = '''help...in the office''')\n\nIn this case, it appears as though the elided material corresponds to the discontinuous word combination including ''help'' and ''in the office''.\n\n===Pseudoclefting===\nPseudoclefting is similar to clefting in that it puts emphasis on a certain phrase in a sentence. There are two variants of the pseudocleft test. One variant inserts the test string X in a sentence starting with a free relative clause: ''What.....is/are X''; the other variant inserts X at the start of the sentence followed by the ''it/are'' and then the free relative clause: ''X is/are what/who...'' Only the latter of these two variants is illustrated here.<ref>For examples of pseudoclefting used as a test for constituents, see Brown and Miller 1980:25; Aarts and Aarts 1982:98; Borsley 1991:24; Napoli 1993:168; McCawley 1998:64; Haegeman and Gu\u00e9ron 1999:50; Kroeger 2005:82; Downing and Locke 2006:10; Haegeman 2006:88; Payne 2006:160; Culicover 2009:89; Miller 2011:56; Carnie 2013:99; Sportiche et al. 2014:71.</ref>\n\n::Drunks would put off the customers.\n::(a) '''Drunks''' are who could put off the customers.\n::(b) '''The customers''' are who drunks could put off.\n::(c) '''Put off the customers''' is what drunks could do.\n\nThese examples suggest that ''Drunks'', ''the customers'', and ''put off the customers'' are constituents in the test sentence. Pseudoclefting fails to identify most individual words as constituents:\n\n::(d) *'''Could''' is what drunks put off the customers.\n::(e) *'''Put''' is what drunks could off the customers.\n::(f) *'''Off''' is what drunks could put the customers.\n::(g) *'''The''' is who drunks could put off customers.\n::(h) *'''Customers''' is who drunks could put of the.\n\nThe pseudoclefting test is hence like most of the other tests insofar as it identifies phrasal strings as constituents, but does not suggest that sub-phrasal strings are constituents.\n\n===Passivization===\nPassivization involves changing an active sentence to a passive sentence, or vice versa. The [[Object (grammar)|object]] of the active sentence is changed to the [[Subject (grammar)|subject]] of the corresponding passive sentence:<ref>For examples of passivization used as a test for constituents, see Brown and Miller 1980:25; Borsley 1991:24; Thomas 1993:10; Lobeck 2000:49\u201350; Downing and Locke 2006:10; Carnie 2010:21; Sobin 2011:30; Carnie 2013:99; Denham and Lobeck 2013:277.</ref>\n\n::(a) '''Drunks''' could put off '''the customers'''.\n::(b) '''The customers''' could be put off by '''drunks'''.\n\nThe fact that sentence (b), the passive sentence, is acceptable, suggests that ''Drunks'' and ''the customers'' are constituents in sentence (a). The passivization test used in this manner is only capable of identifying subject and object words, phrases, and clauses as constituents. It does not help identify other phrasal or sub-phrasal strings as constituents. In this respect, the value of passivization as test for constituents is very limited.\n\n===Omission (deletion)===\nOmission checks whether the target string can be omitted without influencing the grammaticality of the sentence. In most cases, local and temporal adverbials, attributive modifiers, and optional complements can be safely omitted and thus qualify as constituents.<ref>For examples of omission used as a test for constituents, see Allerton 1979: 113\u20139; Aarts and Aarts 1982: 60\u20131, 65\u20137; Burton\u2013Roberts 1997: 14\u20135; B\u00f6rjars and Burridge 2001: 33\u20134; Payne 2006: 163\u20135; Carnie 2010: 19; Hudson 2010: 147; Quirk et al. 2010: 41, 51, 61; Miller 2011: 54; Sobin 2011: 33).</ref>\n\n::Drunks could put off the customers.\n::(a) Drunks could put off customers. ('''''the''''' has been omitted.)\n\nThis sentence suggests that the definite article ''the'' is a constituent in the test sentence. Regarding the test sentence, however, the omission test is very limited in its ability to identify constituents, since the strings that one wants to check do not appear optionally. Therefore, the test sentence is adapted to better illustrate the omission test:\n\n::The '''obnoxious''' drunks could '''immediately''' put off the customers '''when they arrive'''.\n::(b) The drunks could immediately put off the customers when they arrive. ('''''obnoxious''''' has been successfully omitted.)\n::(c) The obnoxious drunks could put off the customers when they arrive. ('''''immediately''''' has been successfully omitted.)\n::(d) The obnoxious drunks could put off the customers. ('''''when they arrive''''' has been successfully omitted.)\n\nThe ability to omit ''obnoxious'', ''immediately'', and ''when they arrive'' suggests that these strings are constituents in the test sentence. Omission used in this manner is of limited applicability, since it is incapable of identifying any constituent that appears obligatorily. Hence there are many target strings that most accounts of sentence structure take to be constituents but that fail the omission test because these constituents appear obligatorily, such as subject phrases.\n\n===Intrusion===\nIntrusion probes sentence structure by having an adverb \"intrude\" into parts of the sentence. The idea is that the strings on either side of the adverb are constituents.<ref>For examples of intrusion used as a test for constituents, see Radford 1981:60\u20132; 1988:93; McCawley 1998:68\u201370; Fromkin 2000:147\u201351; B\u00f6rjars and Burridge 2001:34; Huddleston and Pullum 2002:21; Moravcsik 2006:123; Payne 2006:162.</ref>\n\n::Drunks could put off the customers.\n::(a) Drunks '''definitely''' could put off the customers.\n::(b) Drunks could '''definitely''' put off the customers.\n::(c) *Drunks could put '''definitely''' off the customers.\n::(d) *Drunks could put off '''definitely''' the customers.\n::(e) *Drunks could put off the '''definitely''' customers.\n\nExample (a) suggests that ''Drunks'' and ''could put off the customers'' are constituents. Example (b) suggests that ''Drunks could'' and ''put off the customers'' are constituents. The combination of (a) and (b) suggest in addition that ''could'' is a constituent. Sentence (c) suggests that ''Drunks could put'' and ''off the customers'' are not constituents. Example (d) suggests that ''Drunks could put off'' and ''the customers'' are not constituents. And example (e) suggests that ''Drunks could put off the'' and ''customers'' are not constituents.\n\nThose that employ the intrusion test usually use a modal adverb like ''definitely''. This aspect of the test is problematic, though, since the results of the test can vary based upon the choice of adverb. For instance, manner adverbs distribute differently than modal adverbs and will hence suggest a distinct constituent structure from that suggested by modal adverbs.\n\n===Wh-fronting===\nWh-fronting checks to see if the test string can be fronted as a wh-word.<ref>For examples of wh-fronting used as a test for constituents, see Radford 1981:108; Haegeman 1991:28; Haegeman and Gu\u00e9ron 1999:46\u20137; Lobeck 2000:57\u20139; Payne 2006:160; Culicover 2009:90\u20131; Denham and Lobeck 2013:279\u201381; Sportiche et al. 2014:58\u201360; M\u00fcller 2016:9.</ref> This test is similar to the answer fragment test insofar it employs just the first half of that test, disregarding the potential answer to the question.\n\n::Drunks would put off the customers.\n::(a) '''Who''' would put off the customers? (''Who \u2194 '''Drunks''''')\n::(b) '''Who''' would drunks put off? (''Who \u2194 '''the customers''''')\n::(c) '''What''' would drunks do? (''What...do \u2194 '''put off the customers''''')\n\nThese examples suggest that ''Drunks'', ''the customers'', and ''put off the customers'' are constituents in the test sentence. Wh-fronting is like a number of the other tests in that it fails to identify many subphrasal strings as constituents:\n\n::(d) *'''Do what''' drunks put off the customers? (''Do what \u2194 '''would''''')\n::(e) *'''Do what''' drunks would off the customers? (''Do what \u2194 '''put''''')\n::(f) *'''What''' would drunks put the customers? (''What \u2194 '''off''''')\n::(g) *'''What''' would drunks put off customers? (''What \u2194 '''the''''')\n::(h) *'''Who''' would drunks put off the? (''Who \u2194 '''customers''''')\n\nThese examples demonstrate a lack of evidence for viewing the individual words ''would'', ''put'', ''off'', ''the'', and ''customers'' as constituents.\n\n===General substitution===\nThe general substitution test replaces the test string with some other word or phrase.<ref>For examples of the general substitution test, see Allerton 1979: 113; Brown and Miller 1980: 38; Aarts and Aarts 1982: 11; Radford 1988: 89\u201391; Moravcsik 2006: 123\u20134; Culicover 2009: 37; Quirk et al. 2010: 41; M\u00fcller 2016: 7\u20138.</ref> It is similar to proform substitution, the only difference being that the replacement word or phrase is not a proform, e.g. \n::Drunks could put off the customers.\n::(a) '''Beggars''' could put off the customers. (Beggars \u2194 '''Drunks''')\n::(b) Drunks could put off '''our guests'''. (our guests \u2194 '''the customers''')\n::(c) Drunks '''would''' put off the customers. (would \u2194 '''could''')\nThese examples suggest that the strings ''Drunks'', ''the customers'', and ''could'' are constituents in the test sentence. There is a major problem with this test, for it is easily possible to find a replacement word for strings that the other tests suggest are clearly not constituents, e.g. \n::(d) Drunks '''piss''' off the customers. (piss \u2194 '''could put''')\n::(e) '''Beggars''' put off the customers. (Beggars \u2194 '''Drunks could''')\n::(f) Drunks '''like''' customers. (like \u2194 '''could put off the''')\nThese examples suggest that ''could put'', ''Drunks could'', and ''could put of the'' are constituents in the test sentence. This is contrary to what the other tests reveal and to what most theories of sentence structure assume. The value of general substitution as test for constituents is therefore suspect. It is like the coordination test in that it suggests that too many strings are constituents.\n\n===Right node raising (RNR)===\n[[Right node raising]], abbreviated as RNR, is a test that isolates the test string on the right side of a coordinate structure.<ref>For examples of RNR used as test for constituents, see Radford 1988: 77\u20138, 97; Radford 1997: 106; McCawley 1998: 60\u20131; Haegeman and Gu\u00e9ron 1999: 52, 77; Sportiche et al. 2014: 67\u20138.</ref> The assumption is that only constituents can be shared by the conjuncts of a coordinate structure, e.g.\n::Drunks could put off the customers.\n::(a) [Drunks] and [beggars] '''could put off the customers'''.\n::(b) [Drunks could], and [they probably would], '''put off the customers'''. \n::(c) [Drunks could approach] and [they would then put off] '''the customers'''.\nThese examples suggest that ''could put off the customers'', ''put off the customers'', and ''the customers'' are constituents in the test sentence. There are two problems with the RNR diagnostic as a test for constituents. The first is that it is limited in its applicability, since it is only capable of identifying strings as constituents if they appear on the right side of the test sentence. The second is that it can suggest strings to be constituents that most of the other tests suggest are not constituents. To illustrate this point, a different example must be used:\n::Frank has given his bicycle to us to use if need be. \n::(d) [Frank has offered], and [Susan has already loaned], '''their bicycles to us to use if need be'''. \n::(e) [Frank has offered his bicycle] and [Susan has already loaned her bicycle] '''to us to use if need be'''.\n::(f) [Frank has offered his bicycle to us] and [Susan has already loaned her bicycle to us] '''to use if need be'''.\nThese examples suggest that ''their bicycles (his bicycle) to us to use if need be'', ''to us to use if need be'', and ''to use if need be'' are constituents in the test sentence. Most theories of syntax do not view these strings as constituents, and more importantly, most of the other tests suggest that they are not constituents.\nIn short, these tests are not taken for granted because a constituent may pass one test and fail to pass many others. We need to consult our intuitive thinking when judging the constituency of any set of words.\n@shams\n\n==Tests grouped in terms of how they test for the constituent ==\nConstituency tests can be organized into three broad categories to manipulate sentence structure, namely substitution, displacement, and deletion. Substitution tests include: general substitution, coordination, proform substitution, VP substitution (with do so), and NP substitution (with one). Displacement tests include: topicalization, clefting, pseudo-clefting, wh-fronting, right node raising, passivization, and intrusion. Deletion tests include: ellipsis and answer-fragments. Consider the following example:<blockquote>''Dogs will always chase cats.''</blockquote>In this sentence, dogs and cats are nouns, will is a modal verb, always is an adverb, and chase is a main verb. This sentence contains a transitive verb, which takes two arguments; the doer of the action, called the agent, and the recipient, called the theme.\n\n=== Substitution tests ===\nSubstitution tests evaluate constituency by replacing a relevant word, or string of words, with another constituent of the same category. The substitutions of interest replace a substring with a word, where that word plays the same kind of role in the sentence as the original sub-string did. \n\n==== Coordination ====\nCoordination is a type of substitution test that tests for constituency. Using and, or, and but are the simplest ways to tell that natural language is recursive. If a string S can be coordinated with a word, or phrase of the same type, then S is hypothesized to be a constituent.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Sportiche, Dominique.|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/861536792|title=An introduction to syntactic analysis and theory|others=Koopman, Hilda Judith., Stabler, Edward P.|isbn=978-1-118-47048-0|location=Hoboken|oclc=861536792}}</ref> Consider the following examples:\n\n# [<sub>DP</sub> '''Dogs and eagles'''] will always chase cats.\n# Dogs will always chase [<sub>DP</sub> '''cats or birds'''].\n# Dogs will [<sub>AdvP</sub> '''always and only'''] chase cats.\n# Dogs [<sub>TP</sub> '''will and should'''] always chase cats.\n# Dogs will always [<sub>VP</sub> '''chase and bite'''] cats.\n# Dogs will always chase cats [<sub>PP</sub> '''down the hill and to the store'''].\n# Dogs will always chase cats [<sub>CP</sub> '''if they are playful and if they are sociable'''].\n\nHowever, the sentences become ungrammatical when the sequences of words coordinated are not of the same syntactic category.\n\n8. * Dogs will always [<sub>VP</sub> '''chase cats and down the hill'''].\n\nFrom the diagnostics, it can be determined that only constituents of the same syntactic category can be coordinated. The ill-formed sentence is marked with an asterisk, since down the hill is a PP, whereas cats is an NP, and therefore is not compliant with this test.\n\n==== '''Do so substitution''' ====\nDo so substitution is a type of substitution test that tests for constituency by replacing a VP with do so. If a string S can be substituted for do so, then S is hypothesized to be a VP constituent. Consider the following examples:\n\n# Dogs will [always chase cats], and eagles will [<sub>VP</sub> '''do so'''] too.\n# Dogs will always [chase cats], but eagles will never [<sub>VP</sub> '''do so'''].\n\nHowever, the sentences become ungrammatical when the words do so are replaced by for a non-VP.\n\n3. * Dogs will always chase [<sub>DP</sub> '''do so'''].\n\nFrom the diagnostics, we know that by using the test we can determine which sequences of words are VP constituents. The first two sentences substitute do so for different VPs. In the first example, do so replaces the entire VP, but in the second, do so replaces the verb and excludes the adverb. The ill-formed sentence is marked with an asterisk, since cats is an DP, and therefore not compliant with this test.\n\n'''One substitution'''\n\nOne substitution is a type of Substitution test that tests for constituency by replacing the indefinite pronoun one for an NP. If a string S can be replaced by one, then S is hypothesized to be a NP constituent. Consider the following examples:\n\n1. Dogs will always chase that black [<sub>NP</sub> '''one'''].\n\n2. This [<sub>NP</sub> '''one'''] will always chase cats.\n\nHowever, the sentences become ungrammatical one is replaced with a non-NP.\n\n3. # [<sub>NP</sub> '''One'''] will always chase cats. \n\n4. * Dogs [<sub>NP</sub> '''one'''] always chase cats.\n\n5. * Dogs will always [<sub>NP</sub> '''one'''] cats.\n\nFrom the diagnostics, we know that the indefinite pronoun one must replace an NP. The ill-formed sentences are marked with an asterisk, since VPs and TPs are not compliant with this test. The third example is marked with a hashtag, signifying its grammatical well-formedness but inappropriate context. Here, one can refer to any living thing, but the meaning dogs can never be recovered.\n\n=== Displacement tests ===\nDisplacement tests include: topicalization, clefting, pseudo-clefting, wh-fronting, right node raising, passivization, and intrusion.\n\n=== Deletion tests ===\nDeletion tests include ellipsis and answer-fragments.\n\n==Other languages==\nA word of caution is warranted concerning the tests for constituents as just discussed above. These tests are found in textbooks on linguistics and syntax that are written mainly with the syntax of English in mind, and the examples that are discussed are mainly from English. The tests may or may not be valid and useful when probing the constituent structure of other languages. Ideally, a battery of tests for constituents can and should be developed for each language, catered to the idiosyncrasies of the language at hand.\n\n==Competing theories==\nConstituent structure analyses of sentences are a central concern for theories of syntax. The one theory can produce an analysis of constituent structure that is quite unlike the next. This point is evident with the two tree diagrams above of the sentence ''Drunks could put off the customers'', where the dependency grammar analysis of constituent structure looks very much unlike the phrase structure analysis. The crucial difference across the two analyses is that the phrase structure analysis views every individual word as a constituent by default, whereas the dependency grammar analysis sees only those individual words as constituents that do not dominate other words. Phrase structure grammars therefore acknowledge many more constituents than dependency grammars.\n\nA second example further illustrates this point (D = determiner, N = noun, NP = noun phrase, Pa = particle, S = sentence, V = Verb, V' = verb-bar, VP = verb phrase):\n\n[[File:Constituents (linguistics) picture 1.png|500px]]\n\nThe dependency grammar tree shows five words and word combinations as constituents: ''who'', ''these'', ''us'', ''these diagrams'', and ''show us''. The phrase structure tree, in contrast, shows nine words and word combinations as constituents: ''what'', ''do'', ''these'', ''diagrams'', ''show'', ''us'', ''these diagrams'', ''show us'', and ''do these diagrams show us''. The two diagrams thus disagree concerning the status of ''do'', ''diagrams'', ''show'',  and ''do these diagrams show us'', the phrase structure diagram showing them as constituents and the dependency grammar diagram showing them as non-constituents. To determine which analysis is more plausible, one turns to the tests for constituents discussed above.<ref>For a comparison of these two competing views of constituent structure, see Osborne (2019:73-94).</ref>\n\nWithin phrase structure grammars, views about of constituent structure can also vary significantly. Many modern phrase structure grammars assume that syntactic branching is always binary, that is, each greater constituent is necessarily broken down into two lesser constituents. More dated phrase structures analyses are, however, more likely to allow n-ary branching, that is, each greater constituent can be broken down into one, two, or more lesser constituents. The next two trees illustrate the distinction (Aux = auxiliary verb, AuxP = auxiliary verb phrase, Aux' = Aux-bar, D = determiner, N = noun, NP = noun phrase, P = preposition, PP = prepositional phrase, Pa = particle, S = sentence, t = trace, V = Verb, V' = verb-bar, VP = verb phrase):\n\n[[File:Constituent (linguistics) 3.png|500px]]\n\nThe details in the second diagram here not crucial to the point at hand. This point is that the all branching there is strictly binary, whereas in the first tree diagram ternary branching is present twice, for the AuxP and for the VP. Observe in this regard that strictly binary branching analyses increase the number of (overt) constituents to what is possible. The word combinations ''have sent many things to us'' and ''many things to us'' are shown as constituents in the second tree diagram but not in the first. Which of these two analyses is better is again at least in part a matter of what the tests for constituents can reveal.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Catena (linguistics)]]\n*[[Finite verb]]\n*[[Non-finite verb]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==References==\n{{div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*Adger, D. 2003.
