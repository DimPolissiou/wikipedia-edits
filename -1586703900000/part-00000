The most prominent of these was the Matranga family,<ref name=\"Devico\">{{Harvnb|DeVico|2007|p=153}}</ref> a gang run by relatives of Charles Matranga, founder of the [[New Orleans crime family]]. Their legitimate business was fruit vending.

Its first leader was Orsario \"Sam\" Matranga, who started leading the family around 1905. Sam's relatives Salvatore Matranga, Pietro \"Peter\" Matranga, and Antonio \"Tony\" Matranga were other members of the gang.\n\nWhen prominent Black Hand leader [[Joseph Ardizzone]] was involved in a dispute with George Maisano, a member of the Matranga gang, they both went to Joseph Cuccia to mediate the dispute.

On September 25, 1906 Cuccia was shot and killed, allegedly by Tony Matranga. With both Ardizzone and Cuccia gone, the Matrangas became the dominant criminal force in Italian Plaza community. To expand their power they began cooperating with the police. Giving up information on their enemies and receiving immunity for most of their crimes, the Matrangas were able to expand their power and influence.

He has a romantic relationship with Angel Aasirvatham, a [[physiotherapy|physiotherapist]] who comically refuses to marry any groom at the last minute due to their love. He has a running feud with a rival don named Daniel. One night, Daniel attacks Michael and his close friend Kathir, who is the coach of the [[Tamil Nadu]] women's [[association football|football]] team. Kathir suffers spinal injuries during the attack, due to which he is paralyzed for a year. To allow the women's football team to take part in the upcoming National Championship in [[Delhi]], Kathir requests to the Tamil Nadu Football Federation to replace him with his former teammate named \"Bigil\", who is none other than Michael. The story then shifts to Michael's past as a football player.\n\nSeven years earlier, Michael was an aspiring footballer and contributed to victories for the Tamil Nadu football team along with Kathir. His father was Rayappan, a don who had a feud with a rival don named Alex, who was Daniel's father. Rayappan encouraged his son's passion for football as he did not want him to end up as a criminal like him. When Michael was unable to make it to the [[India national football team|Indian football team]] due to Rayappan's criminal record, Rayappan personally took up the matter with the [[All India Football Federation]] president J. K. Sharma and forcefully ensured Sharma to include Michael and Kathir in the Indian team probable list. But despite Rayappan's efforts, Michael's football career was cut short as he witnessed Rayappan being killed by Alex and Daniel, just when he was about to leave for Delhi to attend the selection trial for the Indian football team. Michael then killed Alex in front of Daniel, thereby taking revenge for Rayappan's death, and stayed back in Chennai to become the new leader of his father's gang.\n\nIn the present day, Michael accepts Kathir's request to coach the women's football team and leaves for Delhi with the team, with Angel also accompanying them as team physiotherapist. However, due to his criminal background, the girls refuse to cooperate with him, even blaming him for the team's opening loss to [[Manipur]] in the National Championship and requesting the Federation to have him removed. Dejected, Michael gives his resignation to Sharma, but he soon realises that Sharma is targeting him in revenge for the humiliation that he had faced at the hands of Rayappan to allow him into the Indian football team. Sharma sends armed assailants to attack Michael; however, Michael subdues the assailants and withdraws his resignation. He convinces the girls to support him and starts training them hard with the sole focus of winning the Championship. He even manages to bring back two former key players to boost the team's strength: Gayathri, a [[Tamil Brahmin|Brahmin]] girl who had to quit playing football after she was married to a conservative family; and Anitha, who went into depression and refused to leave her room after a man [[acid attack|threw acid]] on her face as she spurned his advances. Despite Sharma trying to rig the team's next match against [[Haryana]] so that they will be eliminated and sent home, they manage to beat Haryana and win all their remaining matches, eventually qualifying for the Final at Chennai, where they are to play Manipur again.\n\nOn the eve of the Final, one of the team's players, Vembu, is kidnapped and forcefully injected with [[cocaine]] by Daniel, who is hired by Sharma in order to sabotage the team's chances of winning the Championship. Though she recovers, she is unable to play in the final as she would fail the dope test. The team's captain, Thendral, is also kidnapped by Daniel, who attempts to forcefully inject cocaine on her as well; however, Michael manages to rescue her. Michael proceeds to kill Daniel once and for all, but when he sees Daniel's young son, he changes his mind and spares Daniel, as he does not want the young boy's future to end up like him by seeing his father die. The next day, Tamil Nadu plays the Final against Manipur without Vembu. The match turns out to be a thriller with Tamil Nadu winning the Championship through a [[Penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty shootout]]. Michael and the team dedicate their success to Kathir, who is watching the match from the dugout in a wheelchair.\n\nDuring the [[Closing credits|credits]], Michael gets Sharma framed for drug possession, leading to Sharma's arrest in [[Malaysia]], where he is on a holiday.

He has a romantic relationship with Angel Aasirvatham, a [[physiotherapy|physiotherapist]] who comically refuses to marry any groom at the last minute due to their love. He has a running feud with a rival don named Daniel. One night, Daniel attacks Michael and his close friend Kathir, who is the coach of the [[Tamil Nadu]] women's [[association football|football]] team. Kathir suffers spinal injuries during the attack, due to which he is paralyzed for a year. To allow the women's football team to take part in the upcoming National Championship in [[Delhi]], Kathir requests to the Tamil Nadu Football Federation to replace him with his former teammate named \"Bigil\", who is none other than Michael. The story then shifts to Michael's past as a football player.\n\nSeven years earlier, Michael was an aspiring footballer and contributed to victories for the Tamil Nadu football team along with Kathir. His father was Rayappan, a don who had a feud with a rival don named Alex, who was Daniel's father. Rayappan encouraged his son's passion for football as he did not want him to end up as a criminal like him. When Michael was unable to make it to the [[India national football team|Indian football team]] due to Rayappan's criminal record, Rayappan personally took up the matter with the [[All India Football Federation]] president J. K. Sharma and forcefully ensured Sharma to include Michael and Kathir in the Indian team probable list. But despite Rayappan's efforts, Michael's football career was cut short as he witnessed Rayappan being killed by Alex and Daniel, just when he was about to leave for Delhi to attend the selection trial for the Indian football team. Michael then killed Alex in front of Daniel, thereby taking revenge for Rayappan's death, and stayed back in Chennai to become the new leader of his father's gang.\n\nIn the present day, Michael accepts Kathir's request to coach the women's football team and leaves for Delhi with the team, with Angel also accompanying them as team physiotherapist. However, due to his criminal background, the girls refuse to cooperate with him, even blaming him for the team's opening loss to [[Manipur]] in the National Championship and requesting the Federation to have him removed. Dejected, Michael gives his resignation to Sharma, but he soon realises that Sharma is targeting him in revenge for the humiliation that he had faced at the hands of Rayappan to allow him into the Indian football team. Sharma sends armed assailants to attack Michael; however, Michael subdues the assailants and withdraws his resignation. He convinces the girls to support him and starts training them hard with the sole focus of winning the Championship. He even manages to bring back two former key players to boost the team's strength: Gayathri, a [[Tamil Brahmin|Brahmin]] girl who had to quit playing football after she was married to a conservative family; and Anitha, who went into depression and refused to leave her room after a man [[acid attack|threw acid]] on her face as she spurned his advances. Despite Sharma trying to rig the team's next match against [[Haryana]] so that they will be eliminated and sent home, they manage to beat Haryana and win all their remaining matches, eventually qualifying for the Final at Chennai, where they are to play Manipur again.\n\nOn the eve of the Final, one of the team's players, Vembu, is kidnapped and forcefully injected with [[cocaine]] by Daniel, who is hired by Sharma in order to sabotage the team's chances of winning the Championship. Though she recovers, she is unable to play in the final as she would fail the dope test. The team's captain, Thendral, is also kidnapped by Daniel, who attempts to forcefully inject cocaine on her as well; however, Michael manages to rescue her. Michael proceeds to kill Daniel once and for all, but when he sees Daniel's young son, he changes his mind and spares Daniel, as he does not want the young boy's future to end up like him by seeing his father die. The next day, Tamil Nadu plays the Final against Manipur without Vembu. The match turns out to be a thriller with Tamil Nadu winning the Championship through a [[Penalty shoot-out (association football)|penalty shootout]]. Michael and the team dedicate their success to Kathir, who is watching the match from the dugout in a wheelchair.\n\nDuring the [[Closing credits|credits]], Michael gets Sharma framed for drug possession, leading to Sharma's arrest in [[Malaysia]], where he is on a holiday.

The monastery's central village was Pomuk (now [[Nepomuk]]).

As a result, Jan became recognized as a local legendary religious-figure [[John of Nepomuk|\"Jan Nepomuck\u00fd\" or \"John of Nepomuk,\"]] leading to [[Pilgrim|pilgrimage]] and his later [[sainthood]].\n\nOn the hill between Pomuk and the monastery, [[Hussites|Hussite]] forces created a fort in 1419 which became [[Zelen\u00e1 Hora Castle]] in 1424.

The very first, possibly from the whole parish, might have been Jan \"John\" Duban (1820-1897) and his family who moved to [[Madison County, Illinois|Illinois side]] of the [[St. Louis]] area around 1851. Given that [[Czech Americans|American Czechs]] were a significant minority, most of his children married people of [[Germanic peoples|German]] descent. Afterwards, immigration increased with the foundation of [[Norddeutscher Lloyd]] in 1857 through which a majority of Mysl\u00edv's immigrants traveled by ship from [[Bremen]] to [[Baltimore]].\n\nDuban was followed by the Tichacek family several years later (no known connection between the two). The Tichacek's temporarily lived in Mysl\u00edv where one of their sons Alois was born in 1857. Shortly afterwards, they also moved to St. Louis. Immigration slowed for a time in the 1860's because of the [[American Civil War]] in which Duban served in the [[Union Army]]. Within a couple years after the war ended, people from Mysl\u00edv poured in waves through the port of [[Baltimore]]. Many of those who settled in Baltimore nested in [[Little Bohemia (Baltimore, Maryland)|Little Bohemia]] and were early participants of the [[St. Wenceslaus Church, Baltimore|St. Wenceslaus Church]]. The Brozik and Zeman families moved to [[Iowa]]. Josefa Silovska, who married in Baltimore, was brought to [[Oklahoma City]] by her husband during the [[Land Rush of 1889]]. Frantiska Protivova's family and the Sevcik's moved to [[Minnesota]]. The Zoubkova sisters moved to [[Cook County, Illinois]] and [[Ohio]].  Some of the Nocar's moved to [[Nebraska]], [[Wisconsin]], and [[Washington (state)|Washington]].

The washing of the feathers was then closed by doders, when they were singing, feasting and dancing. In the carnival time, villagers disguised in masquerade would run around, representing a traditional shaggy laufra, a masked figure walking at the head of the procession, a running Jew with a punch on his back, a photographer or a mare.\n\nGod's punishment for wasting food and goods was widely believed and money would be spent carefully so as to not be condemned for scandalism. People in the village and in the city counted every issued tailor. So, for example, the bark for tannery was peeled from the trees that had been slaughtered during the sap, and the peeled peeling consisted of borders for paper mills. The woodcutters used the brush and the skins at home by cutting them into small pieces and tied them in haggles. These were then settled on the walls throughout the summer. Wads, dry lands and stumps have served as (today one would say excellent ecological) fuel throughout the winter.\n\n== Notable Residents ==\nPetr Vodi\u010dka (1856 - 1911) - teacher\n\nHe was a native of Ro\u017emit\u00e1l pod T\u0159em\u0161\u00ednem, where his father was a miller. He attended a primary school. Later his family moved to Prague, where he attended the main school in Sm\u00edchov and later the grammar school in Mal\u00e1 Strana, then moved to the industrial school in Sm\u00edchov and finally to a real German school in the Old Town of Prague. He then completed his education at the ck Czech Institute for Teacher Education in Prague. In 1877 he was appointed interim administrator of the school in Lu\u017eenice near Doma\u017elice. At the beginning of the school year 1879 he was appointed a definitive teacher at a three-class school in Kolinec. Three years later, he was appointed head teacher in Myslov, where he spent the rest of his life. He died of a stroke visiting his brother in P\u00edsek in 1911.\n\n[[:cs:Ladislav Stehl\u00edk|Ladislav Stehl\u00edk (1908 - 1987)]] - poet, writer\n\nHe was born on 26 June 1908 in house number 36 in [[B\u011bl\u010dice]], lying between [[Blatn\u00e1]] and B\u0159eznice. It is a landscape full of ponds, forests, meadows and intact natural corners inviting for thought. He spent his childhood in this region. His whole life is permeated with the memory of this early period, which is primarily associated with boy's fun, pasture work and the entire cycle of village life. It was during his childhood that he began to fully perceive the beauty of nature, the awareness of home, and to foster an understanding of the poor, rural people.\n\nIn his native town of B\u011bl\u010dice Ladislav Stehl\u00edk attended elementary school, then attended a secondary school in Blatn\u00e1. He spent his childhood joyfully and happily in B\u011bl\u010dice. He did not grow up in a wealthy family, so he and his siblings helped his parents to the farm. Most of all, he liked work on pasture. It was not just work for him, but also fun. As a cowherd boy, he tasted the smell of potato-baked potatoes, kid's games and other pleasures that rural life provided him with in the unspoilt nature.\n\nIn 1924 -1928 he studied at the Teaching Institute in P\u0159\u00edbram. Here he met many of his friends. After graduation, Ladislav began working as a teacher. He first taught at elementary schools around his birthplace, in Leletice, Hud\u010dice and Koupi. From May 1930 until the liberation in 1945, ie for fifteen years, he worked as a teacher in the village of \u0160umava at the elementary school in Mysl\u00edv, Klatovy.\n\nLadislav Stehl\u00edk's Mysl\u00edv stay inspired him to write six poetry collections. This secluded rural environment did not isolate him from cultural events: he contributed to various magazines, collaborated on editing the P\u0159\u00edbram Proceedings Dr\u00faza and constantly maintained friendly and social relations with many important artistic personalities of South and South-Western Bohemia, Podbrdy, Pilsen and Prague. Most, however, gravitated to Pilsen. This became the center of regional poets during Stehl\u00edk's stay in Thinking. Here he often met with his artistic friends and discussed with them cultural events and art.\n\nHis friends, whom he had among the simple rural people and the artists, then visited him at home in Myslov. These included Josef and Karel \u010capek, Jan \u010carek, Franti\u0161ek Halas, Josef Hora, Franti\u0161ek Ka\u0161par, V\u00edt\u011bzslav Nezval, Jaroslav Seifert and Karel Vok\u00e1\u010d, as well as translators Pavel Eisner, V\u00e1clav Pol\u00edvka, Vlastimil Rada, Vojt\u011bch Sedl\u00e1\u010dek, V\u00e1clav \u0160p\u00e1la.\n\nIn 1945, Ladislav Stehl\u00edk and his family moved to Prague, an apartment in Vinohrady, which was left to him by Franti\u0161ek Halas. He refused the offered positions at the Ministry of Information and the Ministry of Education modestly and continued to pursue his teaching profession.

The very first, possibly from the whole parish, might have been Jan \"John\" Duban (1820-1897) and his family who moved to [[Madison County, Illinois|Illinois side]] of the [[St. Louis]] area around 1851. Given that [[Czech Americans|American Czechs]] were a significant minority, most of his children married people of [[Germanic peoples|German]] descent. Afterwards, immigration increased with the foundation of [[Norddeutscher Lloyd]] in 1857 through which a majority of Mysl\u00edv's immigrants traveled by ship from [[Bremen]] to [[Baltimore]].\n\nDuban was followed by the Tichacek family several years later (no known connection between the two). The Tichacek's temporarily lived in Mysl\u00edv where one of their sons Alois was born in 1857. Shortly afterwards, they also moved to St. Louis. Immigration slowed for a time in the 1860's because of the [[American Civil War]] in which Duban served in the [[Union Army]]. Within a couple years after the war ended, people from Mysl\u00edv poured in waves through the port of [[Baltimore]]. Many of those who settled in Baltimore nested in [[Little Bohemia (Baltimore, Maryland)|Little Bohemia]] and were early participants of the [[St. Wenceslaus Church, Baltimore|St. Wenceslaus Church]]. The Brozik and Zeman families moved to [[Iowa]]. Josefa Silovska, who married in Baltimore, was brought to [[Oklahoma City]] by her husband during the [[Land Rush of 1889]].

The washing of the feathers was then closed by doders, when they were singing, feasting and dancing. In the carnival time, villagers disguised in masquerade would run around, representing a traditional shaggy laufra, a masked figure walking at the head of the procession, a running Jew with a punch on his back, a photographer or a mare.\n\nGod's punishment for wasting food and goods was widely believed and money would be spent carefully so as to not be condemned for scandalism. People in the village and in the city counted every issued tailor. So, for example, the bark for tannery was peeled from the trees that had been slaughtered during the sap, and the peeled peeling consisted of borders for paper mills. The woodcutters used the brush and the skins at home by cutting them into small pieces and tied them in haggles. These were then settled on the walls throughout the summer. Wads, dry lands and stumps have served as (today one would say excellent ecological) fuel throughout the winter.\n\n== Notable Residents ==\nPetr Vodi\u010dka (1856 - 1911) - teacher\n\nHe was a native of Ro\u017emit\u00e1l pod T\u0159em\u0161\u00ednem, where his father was a miller. He attended a primary school. Later his family moved to Prague, where he attended the main school in Sm\u00edchov and later the grammar school in Mal\u00e1 Strana, then moved to the industrial school in Sm\u00edchov and finally to a real German school in the Old Town of Prague. He then completed his education at the ck Czech Institute for Teacher Education in Prague. In 1877 he was appointed interim administrator of the school in Lu\u017eenice near Doma\u017elice. At the beginning of the school year 1879 he was appointed a definitive teacher at a three-class school in Kolinec. Three years later, he was appointed head teacher in Myslov, where he spent the rest of his life. He died of a stroke visiting his brother in P\u00edsek in 1911.\n\n[[:cs:Ladislav Stehl\u00edk|Ladislav Stehl\u00edk (1908 - 1987)]] - poet, writer\n\nHe was born on 26 June 1908 in house number 36 in [[B\u011bl\u010dice]], lying between [[Blatn\u00e1]] and B\u0159eznice. It is a landscape full of ponds, forests, meadows and intact natural corners inviting for thought. He spent his childhood in this region. His whole life is permeated with the memory of this early period, which is primarily associated with boy's fun, pasture work and the entire cycle of village life. It was during his childhood that he began to fully perceive the beauty of nature, the awareness of home, and to foster an understanding of the poor, rural people.\n\nIn his native town of B\u011bl\u010dice Ladislav Stehl\u00edk attended elementary school, then attended a secondary school in Blatn\u00e1. He spent his childhood joyfully and happily in B\u011bl\u010dice. He did not grow up in a wealthy family, so he and his siblings helped his parents to the farm. Most of all, he liked work on pasture. It was not just work for him, but also fun. As a cowherd boy, he tasted the smell of potato-baked potatoes, kid's games and other pleasures that rural life provided him with in the unspoilt nature.\n\nIn 1924 -1928 he studied at the Teaching Institute in P\u0159\u00edbram. Here he met many of his friends. After graduation, Ladislav began working as a teacher. He first taught at elementary schools around his birthplace, in Leletice, Hud\u010dice and Koupi. From May 1930 until the liberation in 1945, ie for fifteen years, he worked as a teacher in the village of \u0160umava at the elementary school in Mysl\u00edv, Klatovy.\n\nLadislav Stehl\u00edk's Mysl\u00edv stay inspired him to write six poetry collections. This secluded rural environment did not isolate him from cultural events: he contributed to various magazines, collaborated on editing the P\u0159\u00edbram Proceedings Dr\u00faza and constantly maintained friendly and social relations with many important artistic personalities of South and South-Western Bohemia, Podbrdy, Pilsen and Prague. Most, however, gravitated to Pilsen. This became the center of regional poets during Stehl\u00edk's stay in Thinking. Here he often met with his artistic friends and discussed with them cultural events and art.\n\nHis friends, whom he had among the simple rural people and the artists, then visited him at home in Myslov. These included Josef and Karel \u010capek, Jan \u010carek, Franti\u0161ek Halas, Josef Hora, Franti\u0161ek Ka\u0161par, V\u00edt\u011bzslav Nezval, Jaroslav Seifert and Karel Vok\u00e1\u010d, as well as translators Pavel Eisner, V\u00e1clav Pol\u00edvka, Vlastimil Rada, Vojt\u011bch Sedl\u00e1\u010dek, V\u00e1clav \u0160p\u00e1la.\n\nIn 1945, Ladislav Stehl\u00edk and his family moved to Prague, an apartment in Vinohrady, which was left to him by Franti\u0161ek Halas. He refused the offered positions at the Ministry of Information and the Ministry of Education modestly and continued to pursue his teaching profession. He taught gradually at three Sm\u00edchov schools until 1966, when he retired and continued to pursue literary work.\n\nIn 1968, on the anniversary of his 60th birthday, he was awarded the title of Merited Artist. He died on September 11, 1987 in Prague and at his request was buried in his native B\u011bl\u010dice. The grave of Ladislav Stehl\u00edk is decorated with a bust by sculptor B\u0159etislav Benda.\n\nBlanka Stehl\u00edkov\u00e1 (1933) - historian\n\nArt historian, journalist PhDr. Blanka Stehl\u00edkov\u00e1 Csc.

A French priest, by the name Louis-Joseph D'Herbomez, from the [[Oblates of Mary Immaculate]], became the first Vicar Apostolic of the newly formed territory. He was soon ordained [[Titular Bishop]] of [[Miletopolis]] in 1864 and served the Catholic community until his death in 1890.\n\nOn 2 September 1890, the pre-diocesan Apostolic Vicariate of British Columbia becomes the '''Diocese of New Westminster'''. Another Oblate of Mary Immaculate French Bishop, Pierre-Paul Durieu, took over the responsibilities and served the community until his death in 1899.\n\nOn 1894.07.27, during his tenure, the US [[Territory of Alaska]] was lost in the creation of the [[Apostolic Prefecture of Alaska]].\n\nAnother French Bishop, Augustin Dontenwill, took governance of the Diocese of New Westminster in 1899 and served the community until he resigned, to become the [[Superior General]] of the Oblates of Mary Immaculate, in 1908. Under his tenure the Holy Rosary Church was commissioned.\n\n=== Under the Archdiocese of Victoria ===\nIn 1903, the Diocese of Vancouver Island was elevated to [[Archdiocese of Vancouver Island]] and in 1904, it was renamed as the [[Archdiocese of Victoria]]. A German-born Bishop, Bertram Orth, was appointed Archbishop in 1903 and lead the Archdiocese of Victoria and its suffrages until he resigned in 1908.\n\nOn 19 September 1908, the Diocese of New Westminster was elevated to the '''Metropolitan Archdiocese of Vancouver'''<ref name=\"vatican.va\"/> and in October, 1908, the Archdiocese of Victoria was lowered to the Diocese of Victoria. Father Alexander MacDonald, of [[Nova Scotia]], was quickly appointed and ordained Bishop of Victoria.\n\n=== The Canadian Bishops ===\nFor just over one year the Archdiocese of Vancouver had no bishop until Neil McNeil, Bishop of St. George\u2019s, [[Newfoundland]], became the first appointed Canadian Archbishop of Vancouver on 19 January 1910. His tenure was short, as he then went on to become the Archbishop of Toronto on 10 April 1912.\n\nAugust, 1912, Timothy Casey, Bishop of Saint John in America, [[New Brunswick]], becomes the 5th Archbishop of Vancouver. In 1914, what is now called World War I broke out and Archbishop Casey had to battle hard financial times for the Archdiocese. Under his governance, Holy Rosary Church became a Cathedral. He served his community until his death on October 1931.\n\n=== The \"Iron Duke\" years ===\nAugust 1928, a priest from St. John, New Brunswick, became Coadjutor Archbishop of Vancouver and on 5 October 1931, Bishop William Mark Duke became Archbishop of Vancouver. In his 32 years of service to his community Archbishop Duke had to deal with the [[Great Depression]] of the [[Dirty Thirties]] and later [[World War II]]. His strict disciplinarian beliefs and financial management of the Archdiocese earned him the title \u201cIron Duke\u201d. The legacy that was left behind when Archbishop William Mark Duke retired in March 1964 is impressive. He helped establish St. Mark\u2019s College at the University of British Columbia, 2 Catholic high schools, 1 non-diocese Catholic high school, 22 Catholic elementary schools and 3 Catholic hospitals including many new parishes in the diocese alone.\n\nDuring his tenure the archbishopric lost territory twice, to establish [[suffragan]] sees : on 1936.02.22 the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Nelson|Diocese of Nelson]] was erected and on 1945.12.22 the Diocese of Kamloops. These new diocese helped erect a new high school, new elementary schools & parishes.: Lost territory to establish Diocese of Nelson\n\nThe bishop of Nelson, Martin Michael Johnston, became Coadjutor Archbishop of Vancouver, in 1954, to assist Archbishop Duke during the last 10 years of governance. Bishop Johnston became Archbishop of Vancouver on 1964 and retired in 1969. During Archbishop Johnston tenure, the Vicariate of Prince Rupert was elevated to Diocese of Prince George, in 1967.\n\n=== Project Advance years ===\nAuxiliary Bishop [[James Carney (bishop)|James Carney]] became Archbishop of Vancouver in 1969. Carney became the first Vancouver-born bishop to be appointed to the Archdiocese. During his tenure Carney saw the need to rebuild many of the parishes, schools and hospitals that were showing their age. Project Advance was introduced into the community that required the parishes to raise funds. These funds went back into the community to help rebuild their parishes & schools and also to build new facilities, like Archbishop Carney Regional Secondary School, which was built in the archbishop's honour after he died in 1990.\n\nIt enjoyed a Papal visit from [[Pope John Paul II]] in August 1984.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.gcatholic.org/dioceses/diocese/vanc0.htm|title=Archdiocese of Vancouver, Canada|work=GCatholic|access-date=2018-03-19}}</ref>\n\n=== Archdiocesan synod ===\nThe archdiocese concluded a nine-year [[synod#Synods|synod]] in December 2006.  Lay and religious representatives from every parish, Catholic school, religious community, the local seminary, and Catholic organizations took part, as well as non-Catholic observers who were invited to the process.\n\nAlthough it formally ran from October 2002 to October 2003, extensive preparation went into the synod as far back as 1998 during the period leading up to the Great Jubilee of the Year 2000. The synod\u2019s aim was to bring the Church of Vancouver into the 21st century, from the \u201cmaintenance\u201d mode it was in to more of a mission-driven model, as former Archbishop Emeritus [[Adam Exner]], OMI, put it.\n\nOn December 3, 2006, at Holy Rosary Cathedral, Archbishop [[Raymond Roussin]] officially declared the synod closed, officially setting in motion the initiatives proposed.\n\nAccording to the archdiocesan newspaper ''The B.C. Catholic'', the first 20 declarations from the synod were to come into effect almost immediately. \"Among the highlights are initiatives to encourage pastors to delegate more duties to the laity, to promote the faith formation of teachers, to initiate an adult faith formation strategy, to establish an office and vicar for evangelization, and to initiate a support group for priests.\"\n\n=== Current Situation ===\nThe archdiocese is now working in a significant infrastructure upgrade. This includes seismic upgrades to many churches and schools.<ref>{{cite web|title=Infrastructure Renewal Project Brief|url=http://rcav.org/infrastructure-renewal-project-brief/|website=Archdiocese of Vancouver}}</ref> The Archdiocese of Vancouver is considered to be among the most conservative of Canada.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Todd|first1=Douglas|title=Contrasting two B.C.

A French priest, by the name Louis-Joseph D'Herbomez, from the [[Oblates of Mary Immaculate]], became the first Vicar Apostolic of the newly formed territory. He was soon ordained [[Titular Bishop]] of [[Miletopolis]] in 1864 and served the Catholic community until his death in 1890.\n\nOn 2 September 1890, the pre-diocesan Apostolic Vicariate of British Columbia becomes the '''Diocese of New Westminster'''. Another Oblate of Mary Immaculate French Bishop, Pierre-Paul Durieu, took over the responsibilities and served the community until his death in 1899.\n\nOn 1894.07.27, during his tenure, the US [[Territory of Alaska]] was lost in the creation of the [[Apostolic Prefecture of Alaska]].\n\nAnother French Bishop, Augustin Dontenwill, took governance of the Diocese of New Westminster in 1899 and served the community until he resigned, to become the [[Superior General]] of the Oblates of Mary Immaculate, in 1908. Under his tenure the Holy Rosary Church was commissioned.\n\n=== Under the Archdiocese of Victoria ===\nIn 1903, the Diocese of Vancouver Island was elevated to [[Archdiocese of Vancouver Island]] and in 1904, it was renamed as the [[Archdiocese of Victoria]]. A German-born Bishop, Bertram Orth, was appointed Archbishop in 1903 and lead the Archdiocese of Victoria and its suffrages until he resigned in 1908.\n\nOn 19 September 1908, the Diocese of New Westminster was elevated to the '''Metropolitan Archdiocese of Vancouver'''<ref name=\"vatican.va\"/> and in October, 1908, the Archdiocese of Victoria was lowered to the Diocese of Victoria. Father Alexander MacDonald, of [[Nova Scotia]], was quickly appointed and ordained Bishop of Victoria.\n\n=== The Canadian Bishops ===\nFor just over one year the Archdiocese of Vancouver had no bishop until Neil McNeil, Bishop of St. George\u2019s, [[Newfoundland]], became the first appointed Canadian Archbishop of Vancouver on 19 January 1910. His tenure was short, as he then went on to become the Archbishop of Toronto on 10 April 1912.\n\nAugust, 1912, Timothy Casey, Bishop of Saint John in America, [[New Brunswick]], becomes the 5th Archbishop of Vancouver. In 1914, what is now called World War I broke out and Archbishop Casey had to battle hard financial times for the Archdiocese. Under his governance, Holy Rosary Church became a Cathedral. He served his community until his death on October 1931.\n\n=== The \"Iron Duke\" years ===\nAugust 1928, a priest from St. John, New Brunswick, became Coadjutor Archbishop of Vancouver and on 5 October 1931, Bishop William Mark Duke became Archbishop of Vancouver. In his 32 years of service to his community Archbishop Duke had to deal with the [[Great Depression]] of the [[Dirty Thirties]] and later [[World War II]]. His strict disciplinarian beliefs and financial management of the Archdiocese earned him the title \u201cIron Duke\u201d. The legacy that was left behind when Archbishop William Mark Duke retired in March 1964 is impressive. He helped establish St. Mark\u2019s College at the University of British Columbia, 2 Catholic high schools, 1 non-diocese Catholic high school, 22 Catholic elementary schools and 3 Catholic hospitals including many new parishes in the diocese alone.\n\nDuring his tenure the archbishopric lost territory twice, to establish [[suffragan]] sees : on 1936.02.22 the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Nelson|Diocese of Nelson]] was erected and on 1945.12.22 the Diocese of Kamloops. These new diocese helped erect a new high school, new elementary schools & parishes.: Lost territory to establish Diocese of Nelson\n\nThe bishop of Nelson, Martin Michael Johnston, became Coadjutor Archbishop of Vancouver, in 1954, to assist Archbishop Duke during the last 10 years of governance. Bishop Johnston became Archbishop of Vancouver on 1964 and retired in 1969. During Archbishop Johnston tenure, the Vicariate of Prince Rupert was elevated to Diocese of Prince George, in 1967.\n\n=== Project Advance years ===\nAuxiliary Bishop [[James Carney (bishop)|James Carney]] became Archbishop of Vancouver in 1969. Carney became the first Vancouver-born bishop to be appointed to the Archdiocese. During his tenure Carney saw the need to rebuild many of the parishes, schools and hospitals that were showing their age. Project Advance was introduced into the community that required the parishes to raise funds. These funds went back into the community to help rebuild their parishes & schools and also to build new facilities, like Archbishop Carney Regional Secondary School, which was built in the archbishop's honour after he died in 1990.\n\nIt enjoyed a Papal visit from [[Pope John Paul II]] in August 1984.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.gcatholic.org/dioceses/diocese/vanc0.htm|title=Archdiocese of Vancouver, Canada|work=GCatholic|access-date=2018-03-19}}</ref>\n\n=== Archdiocesan synod ===\nThe archdiocese concluded a nine-year [[synod#Synods|synod]] in December 2006.  Lay and religious representatives from every parish, Catholic school, religious community, the local seminary, and Catholic organizations took part, as well as non-Catholic observers who were invited to the process.\n\nAlthough it formally ran from October 2002 to October 2003, extensive preparation went into the synod as far back as 1998 during the period leading up to the Great Jubilee of the Year 2000. The synod\u2019s aim was to bring the Church of Vancouver into the 21st century, from the \u201cmaintenance\u201d mode it was in to more of a mission-driven model, as former Archbishop Emeritus [[Adam Exner]], OMI, put it.\n\nOn December 3, 2006, at Holy Rosary Cathedral, Archbishop [[Raymond Roussin]] officially declared the synod closed, officially setting in motion the initiatives proposed.\n\nAccording to the archdiocesan newspaper ''The B.C. Catholic'', the first 20 declarations from the synod were to come into effect almost immediately. \"Among the highlights are initiatives to encourage pastors to delegate more duties to the laity, to promote the faith formation of teachers, to initiate an adult faith formation strategy, to establish an office and vicar for evangelization, and to initiate a support group for priests.\"\n\n=== Current Situation ===\nThe archdiocese is now working in a significant infrastructure upgrade. This includes seismic upgrades to many churches and schools.<ref>{{cite web|title=Infrastructure Renewal Project Brief|url=http://rcav.org/infrastructure-renewal-project-brief/|website=Archdiocese of Vancouver}}</ref> The Archdiocese of Vancouver is considered to be among the most conservative of Canada.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Todd|first1=Douglas|title=Contrasting two B.C.

On the escutcheon it is depicted as casting a net into the ocean referencing [[Matthew 4]]:18-19:<blockquote>''\"As he walked by the Sea of Galilee, he saw two brothers, Simon who is called Peter and Andrew his brother, casting a net into the sea; for they were fishermen.

Two men, '''Vladyslav Volkovich''' (\u0412\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0438\u0441\u043b\u0430\u0432 \u0412\u043e\u043b\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447) and '''Volodymyr Kondratenko''' (\u0412\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043c\u0438\u0440 \u041a\u043e\u043d\u0434\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043d\u043a\u043e) were arrested and charged with 16 murders. Most victims were shot with a [[.22]] sporting rifle and stabbed or [[bludgeoned]] with a wide variety of weapons ranging from stitching awls to bricks and iron bars. The killers claimed that they began the murder spree in order to prepare themselves for an eventual career as contract killers, practicing on the homeless, and continued killing for profit and for fun. Kondratenko committed suicide in prison during the trial. Volkovich was found guilty and sentenced to life in prison.\n\n==Murders==\n\nOn June 18, 1996, a 44-year-old factory worker named Yevheniy Osechkin was found dead near the [[Karavaevi Dachi railway station]] in Kiev. An anonymous tipster called the police and claimed that someone was just shot with a silenced pistol. However forensics uncovered that the victim was actually shot with a .22 round (a single shell casing was recovered), and stabbed multiple times. The tipster was never located. Investigation quickly determined that Osechkin, a factory worker, had no enemies, and robbery was ruled out as a motive as Osechkin still had the salary he received the day of the murder on his person.\n\nInvestigators then began looking at other murders in the area, and found that some months earlier a homeless man had been shot with a .22 rifle and stabbed in the same area, just 100 meters away from the spot where Osechkin was murdered.\nInvestigators began canvassing the area, and set up surveillance at the train station. Some people that raised the suspicion of the investigators were arrested, but all had alibis for the time of the murders.\n\nTwo weeks later a well-known local doctor named Oleksandr Yehorov was shot and killed in his car in broad daylight. Some witnesses to the murder were located, who provided a description of a suspect described as a lone man of about 30 years of age.\n\nLess than an hour after Yehorov's murder, another male victim was found several blocks away, again shot with a .22 rifle and stabbed. Description of a man seen loitering in the area matched the suspect in the Yehorov and the Osechkin murders. Fingerprints were also recovered from both scenes.\n\nHowever, no match was found for the fingerprints in any databases, and the description offered few leads. The investigation stalled until another murder was reported two weeks later. The new victim was a man named Oleksandr Shpack. Prior to the murder he was at a birthday party with his girlfriend. After getting drunk, Shpack got into an argument with two men who crashed the party. All four then left the party. Shpack was found shot and stabbed a short time later. Shpack's girlfriend provided a description of the two men, which matched the earlier murders. She also remembered that one of the men was named Volodymyr.\n\n===More victims===\n\nOn September 4, another male victim was found in the streets, shot in the head and the chest with a .22 rifle and stabbed. Shell casings found at the scene tied it with the earlier murders. However, the victim was never identified and no witnesses came forward. The investigation stalled again.\n\nOn September 28 at about 10:30 PM, another male victim aged 35 to 40, this time a man named Petr Gromov, was found shot in his vehicle, a [[AvtoVAZ|VAZ-2106]]. After being shot twice in the head, Gromov was stabbed multiple times. The killers pushed the body out of the car and tried to drive away, but the shots broke a window and punctured the roof, and the killers abandoned the vehicle less than a block away, apparently concerned that the damage would draw unwanted attention.\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Sotzialistichna Street.jpg|right|thumb|Sotzialistychna Street, location of the Bykov and Hromov murders.]] -->\nInvestigators were now convinced that they were dealing with a pair of serial killers who targeted men in mid-to-late 30s. Local [[militsia]] (police) was instructed to arrest anyone matching the description on sight. Canvassing apartments near the Hromov murder scene, they located a woman who claimed to recognize one of the suspects as a man named Volodymyr who lived nearby. Police put the building she pointed out under surveillance. Surveillance located an unlocked door in the building, and there was a dead body inside the apartment, also shot and stabbed. The victim was identified as Oleksandr Bykov. His death was estimated to have occurred on September 23. Several unlit matches had been stuck between the door and the frame, which fell out when the door was opened. Investigators surmised that these were markers left by the killers to determine whether the door had been opened in case they ever returned. The apartment was put under constant surveillance, and a man matching the description was seen to approach the building three days later. Unfortunately something spooked him, and the investigators lost the man when he ran into a nearby marketplace.\n\n===Capture===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Kondratenko's Police Sketch.jpg|left|thumb|Kondratenko's Police Sketch.]] -->\nBy this time, five more murders had been tied to the .22 killings, with a total of 11 known victims. Investigators suspected that there had been some others. Desperate for leads, the investigators pored over older reports. Crime scene photographs from the Bykov crime scene contained the images of a person matching a suspect's description. The man volunteered to assist the police in search for clues and gave them his name. He was identified as Volodymyr Dmytrovych Kondratenko. However, the investigators did not have his address. Continued surveillance on a Sotzialistychna Street block where the Bykov and Gromov murders took place quickly located Kondratenko loitering with another man who also matched a suspect's description. The second man was later identified as Vladyslav Volkovych. By the time the information was sent up the chain and the two men were ordered detained, the pair claimed one final victim, an unidentified woman they struck and killed while driving drunk at a high rate of speed in a stolen [[AvtoVAZ|VAZ-2102]]. The car was stolen in preparation for a burglary of a commercial warehouse, where they also planned to murder the lone guard.\n\nOnce detained, the men quickly confessed to over 20 murders, as well as numerous robberies, carjackings, and burglaries.<ref name=\"duo\">{{cite news|url=http://www.podrobnosti.com.ua/projects/vovremya/2003/06/02/62096.html|title=Serial Killer Duo|date=June 2, 2003|publisher=Podrobnosti|accessdate=2009-01-04}}</ref>\n\n===Findings===\n\nThe reasons behind Kondratenko's assistance in the Bykov investigation were quickly uncovered. Apparently Kondratenko had been friends with Bykov for years, and also had an affair with Bykov's wife. Bykov also reportedly owned a pistol that Kondratenko wanted for himself. After the murder he continued to see the victim's wife, and drove her to the morgue and appointments with investigators, ostensibly helping her to look for her husband's killer, all in order to continue their affair.\n\nThe killers' MO was also explained, shedding light on the reasons why most witnesses only saw one killer with most victims. By the time the men began killing drivers for their cars, Volkovich would hitch-hike, and ask the drivers to go to an address to pick up a \"friend with a box\". The waiting friend would be Kondratenko, and the box would contain their .22 [[TOZ rifle|TOZ-16]] sporting rifle. Kondratenko would immediately shoot the driver, and Volkovich would stab him at the same time. They had apparently murdered at least 7 men for their cars, most of which they later sold.\n\n===Trial===\n\nThe case quickly went to trial. Two more co-conspirators were identified. Andriy Tymoshyn, a former Senior Customs Inspector, was charged with one of the murders and the subsequent auto theft. Serhiy Tretiachenko, a delivery driver, was charged with assisting Kondratenko with attempted auto theft in a murder / burglary scheme that was cut short by the arrest. Two main suspects, Volkovich and Kondratenko, had confessed to over 20 murders, but many of their earlier victims who had been homeless were never located. The two men were charged with only 16 of the murders.\n\nDays after the trial began, Kondratenko overdosed on prescription medication and died while in police custody. His death was ruled a suicide. After his death, Volkovich attempted to change his testimony to paint Kondratenko as the only trigger man in all of the murders. Tymoshyn also changed his testimony, claiming that he was unaware that the other men planned to kill their victim, and simply went along to rob a taxi driver. Kondratenko had earlier stated that Tymoshyn had offered them a price to kill that particular victim, who was apparently in conflict with the inspector.\n\nAfter a lengthy trial, all three living suspects were found guilty in August 2000. Volkovich received the sentence of [[life imprisonment]], as the death penalty had been abolished in Ukraine.<ref name=\"duo\"/><ref name=\"seven\">{{cite news|url=http://www.segodnya.ua/oldarchive/c2256713004f33f5c225690e00485b8e.html|title=Fine, Seven Murders are Mine|date=July 1, 2000|publisher=[[Segodnya]]|accessdate=2009-01-04}}</ref><ref name=\"dangerous\">{{cite news|url=http://www.segodnya.ua/oldarchive/d1ed0871c90c9696c22567b5004c126a.html|title=Kiev's most dangerous killer in no rush to go to court|date=July 22, 1999|publisher=[[Segodnya]]|accessdate=2009-01-04}}</ref>\n\n==Suspects==\n{{unsourced section|date=March 2016}}\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Vladislav Volkovich.jpg|right|thumb|Vladyslav Volkovich during questioning.]] -->\nAccording to a psychological profile prepared by the prosecution, Kondratenko had been a model child until he started school, when a constant physical abuse by his father began to take its toll. Kondratenko was initially a good student, but his perfectionist father would severely beat him for any grade below a 5 or Excellent. Kondratenko's personality quickly changed; first he'd get on his knees and beg his teachers not to give him lower grades, but quickly stopped and became shy and withdrawn. After graduation Kondratenko's father, a construction worker, forced his son to go into an architectural college. Kondratenko dropped out after one semester, and at the age of 18 was drafted into the [[Soviet Army]].\n\nArmy service was reportedly hard on Kondratenko, who was frequently injured, once receiving a serious concussion after falling from a tank. He was also constantly abused in the atmosphere of rampant [[hazing]] ([[dedovshchina]]). He was discharged after the compulsory service, and reported back home in civilian clothes, instantly inviting a beating from his father for not being in uniform. Kondratenko planned to go back to school, but came down with a severe case of [[jaundice]] which left permanent disfiguring marks on his face. Kondratenko was so unhappy with his appearance that he refused to go outside for months. He was eventually committed to a psychiatric institution by his parents, but after some time was deemed sane and released. Unable to find a job, and continuing to stay at home most of the time, the conflict between Kondratenko and his father continued to grow. Kondratenko knew that he needed to move out, and in order to move out, he needed money.\n\nVladyslav Volkovich, according to prosecution, had \"an even less interesting background than Kondratenko\". He was reportedly a twin, growing up in an uneventful household with no reported instances of abuse or aggression. Growing up in poverty, Volkovich was always preoccupied with appearances and looking for ways to make money, but did not want a full-time job. He made friends with Kondratenko and the two men often discussed various ways of making money, as well as various philosophical concepts, eventually deciding that \"there is no such thing as morals or honor in this world\".\n\n==Motivation==\n\nThe two men discussed becoming contract killers, thinking that this would be a perfect job for them. They also discussed killing some of their friends for more immediate financial gain. However they did not know how to look for contract work, and were unsure they'd be able to kill a friend on the first try, so they decided to practice on the homeless. They reportedly killed at least five before risking to attack a more dangerous target. They eventually settled on attacking car owners; owning a personal vehicle was a considerable luxury and a sign of wealth in the former Soviet Union of the early 1990s. However the killers admitted that they did not have much luck killing random car owners, as most of them had little if any money on them, and taking and later selling their cars was difficult. By this time however both men admitted that they enjoyed the act of killing by itself, and continued to kill even if it didn't bring financial gain.\n\nSpeaking of their victims at trial, Volkovich stated that \"they were nothing to me, not people, just items in a list\". He then added that murders became like a drug to him. \"They made me feel like a superman\", he said. The only victim he expressed any regret over was their last, the woman he had accidentally hit while drunk driving, and the pair's only known female victim.<ref name=\"loser\">{{cite news|url=http://www.segodnya.ua/oldarchive/c2256713004f33f5c225691900441f62.html|title=Serial Killer: Superman or Loser|date=September 7, 2000|publisher=[[Segodnya]]|accessdate=2009-01-04}}</ref><ref name=\"advocate\">{{cite news|url=http://www.segodnya.ua/oldarchive/c2256713004f33f5c225692e004417bf.html|title=Interview with Devil's Advocate|date=August 2, 2000|publisher=[[Segodnya]]|accessdate=2009-01-04}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[Dnepropetrovsk maniacs]], two Ukrainian serial killers who also worked in a group, occasionally robbing their victims.\n* [[Thrill killing]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n[[Category:1960s births]]\n[[Category:1997 deaths]]\n[[Category:Criminal duos]]\n[[Category:Male serial killers]]\n[[Category:Serial killers who committed suicide in prison custody]]\n[[Category:Ukrainian serial killers]]\n", "text_old": "{{More sources|date=March 2009}}\n{{Infobox serial killer\n| name=Nighttime Killers\n| image=\n| image_size=200px\n| caption=Volodymyr Kondratenko\n| birthname=Vladislav Volkovich<br />Volodymyr Kondratenko\n| alias=The Nighttime Killers \n| birth_date=ca. 1967\n| birth_place=[[Kiev]], [[Ukrainian SSR]], [[Soviet Union]]\n| death_date=Kondratenko:<br />May 31, 1997\n| cause=Suicide\n| victims=16\n| country=[[Ukraine]]\n| states=\n| beginyear=1991\n| endyear=1996\n| apprehended=1996\n| penalty=Volkovich:<br />[[Life imprisonment]]\n}}\nThe '''Nighttime Killers''' (\u041d\u0456\u0447\u043d\u0438\u0439 \u0421\u0435\u0440\u0456\u0439\u043d\u0438\u043a) is the media [[epithet]] for the killers responsible for a string of brutal murders in [[Kiev]], [[Ukraine]] between 1991 and 1997. Two men, '''Vladyslav Volkovich''' (\u0412\u043b\u0430\u0434\u0438\u0441\u043b\u0430\u0432 \u0412\u043e\u043b\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0438\u0447) and '''Volodymyr Kondratenko''' (\u0412\u043e\u043b\u043e\u0434\u0438\u043c\u0438\u0440 \u041a\u043e\u043d\u0434\u0440\u0430\u0442\u0435\u043d\u043a\u043e) were arrested and charged with 16 murders. Most victims were shot with a [[.22]] sporting rifle and stabbed or [[bludgeoned]] with a wide variety of weapons ranging from stitching awls to bricks and iron bars. The killers claimed that they began the murder spree in order to prepare themselves for an eventual career as contract killers, practicing on the homeless, and continued killing for profit and for fun. Kondratenko committed suicide in prison during the trial. Volkovich was found guilty and sentenced to life in prison.\n\n==Murders==\n\nOn June 18, 1996, a 44-year-old factory worker named Yevheniy Osechkin was found dead near the [[Karavaevi Dachi railway station]] in Kiev. An anonymous tipster called the police and claimed that someone was just shot with a silenced pistol. However forensics uncovered that the victim was actually shot with a .22 round (a single shell casing was recovered), and stabbed multiple times. The tipster was never located. Investigation quickly determined that Osechkin, a factory worker, had no enemies, and robbery was ruled out as a motive as Osechkin still had the salary he received the day of the murder on his person.\n\nInvestigators then began looking at other murders in the area, and found that some months earlier a homeless man had been shot with a .22 rifle and stabbed in the same area, just 100 meters away from the spot where Osechkin was murdered.\nInvestigators began canvassing the area, and set up surveillance at the train station. Some people that raised the suspicion of the investigators were arrested, but all had alibis for the time of the murders.\n\nTwo weeks later a well-known local doctor named Oleksandr Yehorov was shot and killed in his car in broad daylight. Some witnesses to the murder were located, who provided a description of a suspect described as a lone man of about 30 years of age.\n\nLess than an hour after Yehorov's murder, another male victim was found several blocks away, again shot with a .22 rifle and stabbed. Description of a man seen loitering in the area matched the suspect in the Yehorov and the Osechkin murders. Fingerprints were also recovered from both scenes.\n\nHowever, no match was found for the fingerprints in any databases, and the description offered few leads. The investigation stalled until another murder was reported two weeks later. The new victim was a man named Oleksandr Shpack. Prior to the murder he was at a birthday party with his girlfriend. After getting drunk, Shpack got into an argument with two men who crashed the party. All four then left the party. Shpack was found shot and stabbed a short time later. Shpack's girlfriend provided a description of the two men, which matched the earlier murders. She also remembered that one of the men was named Volodymyr.\n\n===More victims===\n\nOn September 4, another male victim was found in the streets, shot in the head and the chest with a .22 rifle and stabbed. Shell casings found at the scene tied it with the earlier murders. However, the victim was never identified and no witnesses came forward. The investigation stalled again.\n\nOn September 28 at about 10:30 PM, another male victim aged 35 to 40, this time a man named Petr Gromov, was found shot in his vehicle, a [[AvtoVAZ|VAZ-2106]]. After being shot twice in the head, Gromov was stabbed multiple times. The killers pushed the body out of the car and tried to drive away, but the shots broke a window and punctured the roof, and the killers abandoned the vehicle less than a block away, apparently concerned that the damage would draw unwanted attention.\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Sotzialistichna Street.jpg|right|thumb|Sotzialistychna Street, location of the Bykov and Hromov murders.]] -->\nInvestigators were now convinced that they were dealing with a pair of serial killers who targeted men in mid-to-late 30s. Local [[militsia]] (police) was instructed to arrest anyone matching the description on sight. Canvassing apartments near the Hromov murder scene, they located a woman who claimed to recognize one of the suspects as a man named Volodymyr who lived nearby. Police put the building she pointed out under surveillance. Surveillance located an unlocked door in the building, and there was a dead body inside the apartment, also shot and stabbed. The victim was identified as Oleksandr Bykov. His death was estimated to have occurred on September 23. Several unlit matches had been stuck between the door and the frame, which fell out when the door was opened. Investigators surmised that these were markers left by the killers to determine whether the door had been opened in case they ever returned. The apartment was put under constant surveillance, and a man matching the description was seen to approach the building three days later. Unfortunately something spooked him, and the investigators lost the man when he ran into a nearby marketplace.\n\n===Capture===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Kondratenko's Police Sketch.jpg|left|thumb|Kondratenko's Police Sketch.]] -->\nBy this time, five more murders had been tied to the .22 killings, with a total of 11 known victims. Investigators suspected that there had been some others. Desperate for leads, the investigators pored over older reports. Crime scene photographs from the Bykov crime scene contained the images of a person matching a suspect's description. The man volunteered to assist the police in search for clues and gave them his name. He was identified as Volodymyr Dmytrovych Kondratenko. However, the investigators did not have his address. Continued surveillance on a Sotzialistychna Street block where the Bykov and Gromov murders took place quickly located Kondratenko loitering with another man who also matched a suspect's description. The second man was later identified as Vladyslav Volkovych. By the time the information was sent up the chain and the two men were ordered detained, the pair claimed one final victim, an unidentified woman they struck and killed while driving drunk at a high rate of speed in a stolen [[AvtoVAZ|VAZ-2102]]. The car was stolen in preparation for a burglary of a commercial warehouse, where they also planned to murder the lone guard.\n\nOnce detained, the men quickly confessed to over 20 murders, as well as numerous robberies, carjackings, and burglaries.<ref name=\"duo\">{{cite news|url=http://www.podrobnosti.com.ua/projects/vovremya/2003/06/02/62096.html|title=Serial Killer Duo|date=June 2, 2003|publisher=Podrobnosti|accessdate=2009-01-04}}</ref>\n\n===Findings===\n\nThe reasons behind Kondratenko's assistance in the Bykov investigation were quickly uncovered.

It is one of three secondary titles in WWE, along with the [[WWE Intercontinental Championship]] on [[Raw (WWE brand)|Raw]] and the [[NXT North American Championship]] on [[NXT (WWE brand)|NXT]]. The current champion is [[Andrade Cien Almas|Andrade]],  who is in his first reign.\n\nThe championship was established on January 1, 1975, as the version of the [[NWA United States Heavyweight Championship]] that was defended in [[Jim Crockett Promotions]], and later assumed by [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW), which eventually seceded from the [[National Wrestling Alliance]] (NWA). [[Harley Race]] was the inaugural champion. After WCW was purchased by the then-[[World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF) in 2001, the then-WCW United States Championship was defended in the WWF until it was unified with the Intercontinental Championship at that year's [[Survivor Series (2001)|Survivor Series]]. After the [[WWE brand extension|2002 brand extension]] and the promotion being [[History of WWE#World Wrestling Entertainment|renamed to WWE]], the championship was reactivated as the WWE United States Championship in July 2003 as a secondary title of the SmackDown brand. In 2019, NXT was promoted as WWE's third major brand, adding their North American Championship as a third secondary title for WWE. The U.S. championship has switched between brands over the years, usually as a result of the [[WWE Draft]]; the [[2019 WWE Superstar Shake-up|2019 Superstar Shake-up]] moved the title to Raw.\n\nOf the WWE's currently active championships, the United States Championship is the only one that was not originated in the promotion. It is the second oldest active title in the company, behind the [[WWE Championship]] (1963), but the third longest-tenured championship, behind the WWE and Intercontinental Championships (1979), as the WWE has only owned the U.S. title since 2001.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Harley race.jpg|thumb|upright|The inaugural champion was [[Harley Race]]]]\nThe United States Championship began as a regional championship called the NWA United States Heavyweight Championship, one of several versions of the title allowed in different territories under the [[National Wrestling Alliance]] (NWA) bylaws. It was created by and defended in [[Jim Crockett Promotions|Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling]] (MACW) run by [[Jim Crockett Jr.]] Introduced on January 1, 1975, [[Harley Race]] became the inaugural champion.<ref name= \"US Title history\"/> The title quickly replaced the [[NWA Mid-Atlantic Heavyweight Championship]] as the top singles title in the promotion. While the NWA recognized only one [[NWA World Heavyweight Championship|World Heavyweight Champion]], there was no single undisputed United States Champion as a number of NWA regional promotions recognized their own version of the title and champion. That changed, however, in January 1981; the NWA territory based in [[San Francisco]] folded, which was the last remaining promotion outside the Mid-Atlantic territory that recognized its own United States Champion, leaving the Mid-Atlantic version as the only remaining United States Championship.\n\nThe title remained the primary championship within the Mid-Atlantic territory until 1986 when Crockett gained control of the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. The United States title then became the secondary championship of the promotion. After [[Ted Turner]] bought the company and renamed it [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW) in November 1988, the title continued to be used and recognized as secondary to the World Championship. WCW began to pull itself away from the NWA, demonstrated by the company changing the name of the title to the WCW United States Heavyweight Championship in January 1991.\n\nOn the April 6, 1991, episode of ''[[WCW Saturday Night#World Championship Wrestling TV series (1982-1992)|World Championship Wrestling]]'', Nikita Koloff destroyed the classic 1980s United States Heavyweight Championship belt during a post-match brawl with Lex Luger, who was in his fourth reign as champion. Koloff, who claimed to be the true champion, knocked Luger unconscious by striking him with the title belt and then repeatedly smashed the championship belt into a ringpost. Luger would appear without a physical championship belt, and later became the first to wear a newly designed belt, which was used up through WCW's closing in March 2001, after being purchased by rival promotion, the then-[[WWE|World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF). This version of the United States Heavyweight Championship would also be used during the WWF's [[The Invasion (professional wrestling)|Invasion]] storyline. As part of the WWF's purchase of WCW, the United States Heavyweight Championship became WWF property and during the \"invasion\" period, it was defended and referred to as the WCW United States Championship on WWF shows. At that year's [[Survivor Series (2001)|Survivor Series]], the title was [[Championship unification|unified]] with the then-[[WWF Intercontinental Championship]] when United States Champion [[Edge (wrestler)|Edge]] defeated Intercontinental Champion [[Test (wrestler)|Test]], becoming the new Intercontinental Champion. The United States Championship was subsequently deactivated.\n\nIn July 2003, a year after the [[WWE brand extension|first brand extension]] went into effect in the promotion now renamed World Wrestling Entertainment (WWE), the title was reactivated as the WWE United States Championship by then-[[Professional wrestling authority figures#General Managers 2|SmackDown! General Manager]] [[Stephanie McMahon]] and with a completely new belt design. It was commissioned to be a secondary championship for the [[SmackDown (WWE brand)|SmackDown!]] brand, making the championship the only from WCW to be reactivated as a WWE title, though the second to become a WWE branded title as the [[WCW Cruiserweight Championship]] had also become a WWE title, but it was not deactivated and reactivated; it instead replaced the [[WWF Light Heavyweight Championship]]. After the retirements of the Cruiserweight Championship in 2007, the [[ECW Championship]] in February 2010 (which was reactivated in 2006 for the [[ECW (WWE brand)|ECW]] brand), and the [[WWE Women's Championship (1956\u20132010)|original Women's Championship]] in September 2010, the U.S. title became WWE's only active title to not have originated in the promotion. [[Eddie Guerrero]] became the first champion after its reactivation by winning a tournament at that year's [[Vengeance (2003)|Vengeance]], defeating [[Chris Benoit]] in the final match. This was done shortly after the Intercontinental Championship was recommissioned by the [[Raw (WWE brand)|Raw]] brand, making the title its equal counterpart. The first brand extension ended on August 29, 2011, allowing the United States Championship, as well as all other titles, to be defended on both ''[[WWE Raw|Raw]]'' and ''[[WWE SmackDown|SmackDown]]''. In August 2014, the United States Championship belt, along with all other pre-existing championship belts in WWE at the time, received a minor update, replacing the long-standing scratch logo with WWE's new logo originally used for the [[WWE Network]]. While most other titles have since been redesigned to feature customizable side plates in lieu of a nameplate, the U.S. title has maintained the same belt design since 2003 (minus the minor logo update) and is the only championship belt with a nameplate, which also makes it the oldest belt design currently used in the company (the Raw and SmackDown tag titles are the only other titles that have not been updated to have customizable side plates).\n\nIn 2015, WWE introduced an updated version of its [[Grand Slam (professional wrestling)|Grand Slam Championship]], and the United States Championship became officially recognized as a component of the re-established honor. In August at that year's [[SummerSlam (2015)|SummerSlam]], United States Champion [[John Cena]] faced [[WWE Championship|WWE World Heavyweight Champion]] [[Seth Rollins]] in a [[Professional wrestling match types#Winner Takes All match|Winner Takes All match]], which Rollins ultimately won to become the first wrestler to hold the WWE World Heavyweight Championship and United States Championship simultaneously. Rollins held both titles until Cena defeated Rollins in his rematch for the title at [[Night of Champions (2015)|Night of Champions]] the following month.\n\nIn July 2016, WWE reintroduced the brand extension; during the [[2016 WWE draft|draft]], United States Champion [[Alexander Rusev|Rusev]] was drafted to the Raw brand.<ref name=\"2016WWEdraft\">{{cite web|title=2016 WWE Draft results: WWE officially ushers in New Era|url=http://www.wwe.com/2016-wwe-draft-results|publisher=WWE|accessdate=July 19, 2016}}</ref> Days later, he successfully defended the title against SmackDown draftee [[Zack Ryder]] at [[Battleground (2016)|Battleground]], keeping the title exclusive to Raw.<ref name=\"BG16\">{{cite web|last=Caldwell|first=James|title=7/24 WWE Battleground Results \u2013 CALDWELL'S Complete Report|url=http://www.pwtorch.com/site/2016/07/24/jcbattlegroundppvreport/|publisher=Pro Wrestling Torch|date=July 24, 2016|accessdate=July 24, 2016}}</ref> On April 11, 2017, United States Champion [[Kevin Owens]], along with the title, moved to SmackDown as a result of that year's [[2017 WWE Superstar Shake-up|Superstar Shake-up]].

It is one of three secondary titles in WWE, along with the [[WWE Intercontinental Championship]] on [[Raw (WWE brand)|Raw]] and the [[NXT North American Championship]] on [[NXT (WWE brand)|NXT]]. The current champion is [[Andrade Cien Almas|Andrade]],  who is in his first reign.\n\nThe championship was established on January 1, 1975, as the version of the [[NWA United States Heavyweight Championship]] that was defended in [[Jim Crockett Promotions]], and later assumed by [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW), which eventually seceded from the [[National Wrestling Alliance]] (NWA). [[Harley Race]] was the inaugural champion. After WCW was purchased by the then-[[World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF) in 2001, the then-WCW United States Championship was defended in the WWF until it was unified with the Intercontinental Championship at that year's [[Survivor Series (2001)|Survivor Series]]. After the [[WWE brand extension|2002 brand extension]] and the promotion being [[History of WWE#World Wrestling Entertainment|renamed to WWE]], the championship was reactivated as the WWE United States Championship in July 2003 as a secondary title of the SmackDown brand. In 2019, NXT was promoted as WWE's third major brand, adding their North American Championship as a third secondary title for WWE. The U.S. championship has switched between brands over the years, usually as a result of the [[WWE Draft]]; the [[2019 WWE Superstar Shake-up|2019 Superstar Shake-up]] moved the title to Raw.\n\nOf the WWE's currently active championships, the United States Championship is the only one that was not originated in the promotion. It is the second oldest active title in the company, behind the [[WWE Championship]] (1963), but the third longest-tenured championship, behind the WWE and Intercontinental Championships (1979), as the WWE has only owned the U.S. title since 2001.\n\n== History ==\n[[File:Harley race.jpg|thumb|upright|The inaugural champion was [[Harley Race]]]]\nThe United States Championship began as a regional championship called the NWA United States Heavyweight Championship, one of several versions of the title allowed in different territories under the [[National Wrestling Alliance]] (NWA) bylaws. It was created by and defended in [[Jim Crockett Promotions|Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling]] (MACW) run by [[Jim Crockett Jr.]] Introduced on January 1, 1975, [[Harley Race]] became the inaugural champion.<ref name= \"US Title history\"/> The title quickly replaced the [[NWA Mid-Atlantic Heavyweight Championship]] as the top singles title in the promotion. While the NWA recognized only one [[NWA World Heavyweight Championship|World Heavyweight Champion]], there was no single undisputed United States Champion as a number of NWA regional promotions recognized their own version of the title and champion. That changed, however, in January 1981; the NWA territory based in [[San Francisco]] folded, which was the last remaining promotion outside the Mid-Atlantic territory that recognized its own United States Champion, leaving the Mid-Atlantic version as the only remaining United States Championship.\n\nThe title remained the primary championship within the Mid-Atlantic territory until 1986 when Crockett gained control of the NWA World Heavyweight Championship. The United States title then became the secondary championship of the promotion. After [[Ted Turner]] bought the company and renamed it [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW) in November 1988, the title continued to be used and recognized as secondary to the World Championship. WCW began to pull itself away from the NWA, demonstrated by the company changing the name of the title to the WCW United States Heavyweight Championship in January 1991.\n\nOn the April 6, 1991, episode of ''[[WCW Saturday Night#World Championship Wrestling TV series (1982-1992)|World Championship Wrestling]]'', Nikita Koloff destroyed the classic 1980s United States Heavyweight Championship belt during a post-match brawl with Lex Luger, who was in his fourth reign as champion.

The name was first mentioned in the charter of 825 of Selvin. A further instance may be seen in the Plea Rolls of the Common Pleas, as Wambeleye.<ref>aalt.law.uh.edu; http://aalt.law.uh.edu/E3/CP40no357/aCP40no357mm1toEnd/IMG_7441.htm; third entry, line 3, \"apud Wambeleye\"; in 1349</ref>\n\n===Development===\nThe village of Wembley grew up on the hill by the clearing with the [[Harrow Road]] south of it. Much of the surrounding area remained wooded. In 1547 there were but six houses in Wembley. Though small, it was one of the wealthiest parts of Harrow. At the dissolution of the monasteries in 1543, the manor of Wembley fell to Richard Andrews and [[Sir Leonard Chamberlain|Leonard Chamberlain]], who sold it to Richard Page, Esq., of [[Harrow on the Hill]], the same year.\n\nThe Page family continued as lords of the manor of Wembley for several centuries and eventually commissioned [[Humphry Repton]] (1752\u20131818) the landscape gardener to design what is now [[Wembley Park]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=45423|title=Harrow on the Hill \u2013 British History Online}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=22466|title=Harrow, including Pinner : Manors \u2013 British History Online}}</ref> Wembley Park thus derived its name from Repton's habit of referring to the areas he designed as \"parks\".\n\nThere was a mill on Wembley Hill by 1673. In 1837, the [[London and Birmingham Railway]] (now part of the [[West Coast Main Line]]) was opened from [[Euston railway station|London Euston]] through Wembley to [[Hemel Hempstead railway station|Hemel Hempstead]], and completed to [[Birmingham Curzon Street railway station (1838-1966)|Birmingham Curzon Street]] the following year. The changing names of the local station demonstrated the increasing importance of the 'Wembley' name. 'Sudbury' station opened in 1845, renamed as 'Sudbury and Wembley' in 1882, renamed as 'Wembley for Sudbury' in 1910, renamed as 'Wembley Central' in 1948, at the time of the [[1948 Summer Olympics|Olympic Games]].\n\nTo modernise the service, a new [[Watford DC Line]] was built alongside the main lines and [[Bakerloo line]] trains, and electric trains to [[Broad Street railway station (London)|Broad Street]] started in 1917. Electric trains to London Euston began running in 1922. Since 1917, there have been six platforms at what is now Wembley Central station. In 1880, the [[Metropolitan Railway]] opened its line from [[Baker Street tube station|Baker Street]] through the eastern side of Wembley, but only built a station, [[Wembley Park tube station|Wembley Park]], in 1894. There are now three physically separate services, the [[London to Aylesbury Line]], the [[Metropolitan line]], and the [[Jubilee line]]. Only the latter two services have platforms at Wembley Park station.\n\nIn November 1905, the [[Great Central Railway]] (now, in this section, part of the [[Chiltern Main Line]]) opened a new route for fast expresses that by-passed the congested Metropolitan Railway tracks. It ran between [[Neasden Junction]], south of Wembley, and Northolt Junction, west of London, where a new joint main line with the [[Great Western Railway]] began. Local passenger services from [[Marylebone railway station|London Marylebone]] were added from March 1906, when new stations were opened, including 'Wembley Hill', next to what later became the site of Wembley Stadium \u2013 the national stadium of English sport \u2013 which opened for the [[1923 FA Cup Final|FA Cup Final]] of April 1923, remaining open for 77 years until it closed for reconstruction in October 2000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wembleystadium.com/gloriouspast/historyintroduction|title=404 - Page not found - wembleystadium.com|last=TheFA|access-date=9 October 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101017232053/http://www.wembleystadium.com/GloriousPast/historyIntroduction|archive-date=17 October 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref> After a long planning and redevelopment process dogged by a series of funding problems and construction delays, the new stadium finally opened its doors in March 2007.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/6459415.stm | work=BBC News | title=Doors finally open at new Wembley | date=17 March 2007}}</ref>\n\nWembley Hill station was renamed 'Wembley Complex' in May 1978, before getting its present name of '[[Wembley Stadium railway station|Wembley Stadium]]' in May 1987.<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Mitchell |first1=Vic |last2=Smith |first2=Keith |title=Marylebone to Rickmansworth |series=Midland Main Lines |date=February 2005 |publisher=Middleton Press |location=Midhurst |isbn=1-904474-49-7 |chapter=Figure 51 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:GB British Empire Exhibition Postage Stamps.jpg|thumb|British Empire Exhibition postage stamps]]\n\nThe area around the current Wembley Stadium was the location of the [[British Empire Exhibition]]<ref>[http://disused-rlys.fotopic.net/p49262227.html Photograph of exhibition site]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>[http://disused-rlys.fotopic.net/p49002875.html Map of exhibition site]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>[http://www.tribuneindia.com/2004/20040905/spectrum/art.htm Sunday Tribune of India (newspaper)] Article on exhibition (2004)</ref> of 1924\u20131925.<ref>[http://www.britishpathe.com/record.php?id=75167 British Pathe (agency)] Film of British Empire Exhibition, reel one</ref><ref>[http://www.britishpathe.com/record.php?id=75168 British Pathe (agency)] Film of British Empire Exhibition, reel two</ref><ref>[http://www.britishpathe.com/record.php?id=75169 British Pathe (agency)] Film of British Empire Exhibition, reel three</ref><ref>[http://www.britishpathe.com/record.php?id=75170 British Pathe (agency)] Film of British Empire Exhibition, reel four</ref> Until the 2000s, remnants of the many [[reinforced concrete]] buildings, including the [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|original Wembley Stadium]], remained, but nearly all have now been removed, to make way for redevelopment.\n\nWembley, in common with much of northwest London, had an extensive manufacturing industry, but much of it closed in the 1980s. Factories in the area included Glacier Metals (bearings), Wolf Power Tools, Sunbeam Electrical Appliances, Griffin & George (laboratory equipment) and GEC (whose research laboratories, opened in 1923, were one of the first of their type in the United Kingdom<ref>{{cite book |last1=Clayton |first1=Robert |last2=Algar |first2=Joan |title=The GEC Research Laboratories 1919\u20131984 |publisher=Peter Peregrinus | year=1989 |isbn=0-86341-146-0}}</ref>).\n\n[[File:Central Square, Wembley - geograph.org.uk - 216341.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Central Square under redevelopment in 2006]]\n[[File:High Road, Wembley (2) - geograph.org.uk - 216337.jpg|thumb|left|High Road, near the local station, looking east in 2006]]\nThe retail centre of Wembley (the High Road and north end of Ealing Road) has suffered from chronic traffic congestion and from the opening of neighbouring purpose-built shopping centres, first [[Brent Cross]] in the early 1970s and later the [[Harrow, London|Harrow]] and [[Ealing Broadway]] Shopping Centres. During the 1960s, rebuilding of Wembley Central station, a block of flats, an open-plan shopping plaza, and a car park were constructed on a concrete raft over the railway.\n\nThe shopping plaza suffered slow decline and was therefore poorly maintained. Eventually in the 2000s, plans were approved to completely regenerate the place, carried out by construction company St. Modwen. The first phase, including construction of eighty-five homes, reconstruction of the plaza as a new [[public square]] and opening of new retail units including a [[TK Maxx]], was completed in 2009.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.brentbrain.org.uk/brain/brainzones.nsf/nsgnews/NT00056C82 | title=Public square reopens in Wembley Central|last=Brent Resource and Information Network (BRAIN)|publisher=Brent Council|accessdate=25 October 2009}}</ref><ref>https://www.stmodwen.co.uk/new-public-square-launched-at-wembley-central/</ref> The rest was completed in 2015 after nine years' time, with additional retail and housing units.<ref>https://www.mylondon.news/news/business/wembley-central-invites-you-fun-filled-8912022</ref> The local [[Argos (retailer)|Argos]] store also moved to a new space in the redeveloped area. Extensive redevelopment has also occurred separately in the [[Wembley Park]] area (around the stadium), about a mile northeast from Wembley town centre.\n\nMost of the rest of Wembley's housing consists of inter-war semi-detached houses and terraces and of modern apartment blocks, with a significant minority of detached housing.\n\nThere also used to be a [[British Army]] recruitment centre off the High Road in Wembley. This centre came under attack by an [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|IRA]] bomb in 1990 resulting in the death of a soldier and injuries to four people (see [[1990 Wembley bombing]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/257998235/|title=The Observer from London,  on June 3, 1990 \u00b7 3}}</ref>\n\n==Governance==\n[[File:cmglee_London_Wembley_aerial.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of Wembley and its stadium]]\nWembley formed part of the large ancient parish of [[Harrow on the Hill]] in the [[Gore (hundred)|Gore]] hundred of [[Middlesex]]. In 1894 Wembley was split from Harrow, creating a new parish and [[Urban district (Great Britain and Ireland)|urban district]]. It included [[Alperton]], [[Preston, London|Preston]], [[North Wembley]], [[South Kenton]], [[Tokyngton]], [[Sudbury, London|Sudbury]], [[Wembley Park]] and [[Northwick Park]]. The urban district included the neighbouring parish of [[Kingsbury, London|Kingsbury]] until 1901 and again from 1934.\n\nIn 1937 it was incorporated as the [[Municipal Borough of Wembley]]. The fire brigade headquarters of [[Middlesex County Council]] were located on Harrow Road and is now a fire station of the [[London Fire Brigade]]. [[Brent Town Hall|Wembley Town Hall]] on Forty Lane, built in 1938, became [[Brent Town Hall]] when the municipal boroughs of Wembley and [[Municipal Borough of Willesden|Willesden]] were amalgamated in 1965 to form the [[London Borough of Brent]] and transferred to [[Greater London]]. Since the 2010 elections, Brent Council has been controlled by the Labour Party.\n\nWembley falls within the UK Parliament constituency of [[Brent North (UK Parliament constituency)|Brent North]] and the London Assembly constituency of [[Brent and Harrow (London Assembly constituency)|Brent and Harrow]].\n\n==Geography==\nUntil the nineteenth century, Wembley was rural and the sector retains a number of green spaces. These include Barham Park (10.5 hectares) in Sudbury Town, King Edward VII Park, established in 1914 behind the High Road (10.5 hectares), and Sudbury Green.  Less managed spaces include Fryent Country Park, Barn Hill (19.87 hectares), and Vale Farm sports ground (30 hectares). Brent River Park / Tokyngton Recreation Ground (20.26 hectares) has recently been restored, returning the river to a more natural course.\n\nNearby Sudbury Golf Course backs onto the [[Grand Union Canal]], with its towpath running into central London. Sudbury Squash and Tennis Club has outdoor tennis courts, an indoor squash court, and a clubhouse. Wembley is a short distance away from the [[Brent Reservoir|Welsh Harp]] reservoir and open space, created in the early 19th century by damming the [[River Brent]] to provide water for the [[Grand Union Canal]].\n\nThe area is identified in the [[Mayor of London]]'s [[London Plan]] as one of thirty-five major centres in Greater London.<ref name=London_plan_f08>{{cite web|url=http://www.london.gov.uk/thelondonplan/docs/londonplan08.pdf | author=[[Mayor of London]] | publisher=[[Greater London Authority]] | title=London Plan (Consolidated with Alterations since 2004) |date=February 2008 }}</ref>\n\nWembley is made up of six wards: [[Wembley Central (ward)|Wembley Central]], [[Alperton]], [[Tokyngton]], Barnhill, [[Preston, London|Preston]] and [[Sudbury, London|Sudbury]].

Unlike typical British [[high street]]s however, Wembley lacks a town centre network or pedestrianised high streets, with almost all commercial high street businesses located along a 1000-yard stretch of road (High Road).

Much of the surrounding area remained wooded. In 1547 there were but six houses in Wembley. Though small, it was one of the wealthiest parts of Harrow. At the dissolution of the monasteries in 1543, the manor of Wembley fell to Richard Andrews and [[Sir Leonard Chamberlain|Leonard Chamberlain]], who sold it to Richard Page, Esq., of [[Harrow on the Hill]], the same year.\n\nThe Page family continued as lords of the manor of Wembley for several centuries and eventually commissioned [[Humphry Repton]] (1752\u20131818) the landscape gardener to design what is now [[Wembley Park]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=45423|title=Harrow on the Hill \u2013 British History Online}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=22466|title=Harrow, including Pinner : Manors \u2013 British History Online}}</ref> Wembley Park thus derived its name from Repton's habit of referring to the areas he designed as \"parks\".\n\nThere was a mill on Wembley Hill by 1673. In 1837, the [[London and Birmingham Railway]] (now part of the [[West Coast Main Line]]) was opened from [[Euston railway station|London Euston]] through Wembley to [[Hemel Hempstead railway station|Hemel Hempstead]], and completed to [[Birmingham Curzon Street railway station (1838-1966)|Birmingham Curzon Street]] the following year. The changing names of the local station demonstrated the increasing importance of the 'Wembley' name. 'Sudbury' station opened in 1845, renamed as 'Sudbury and Wembley' in 1882, renamed as 'Wembley for Sudbury' in 1910, renamed as 'Wembley Central' in 1948, at the time of the [[1948 Summer Olympics|Olympic Games]].\n\nTo modernise the service, a new [[Watford DC Line]] was built alongside the main lines and [[Bakerloo line]] trains, and electric trains to [[Broad Street railway station (London)|Broad Street]] started in 1917. Electric trains to London Euston began running in 1922. Since 1917, there have been six platforms at what is now Wembley Central station. In 1880, the [[Metropolitan Railway]] opened its line from [[Baker Street tube station|Baker Street]] through the eastern side of Wembley, but only built a station, [[Wembley Park tube station|Wembley Park]], in 1894. There are now three physically separate services, the [[London to Aylesbury Line]], the [[Metropolitan line]], and the [[Jubilee line]]. Only the latter two services have platforms at Wembley Park station.\n\nIn November 1905, the [[Great Central Railway]] (now, in this section, part of the [[Chiltern Main Line]]) opened a new route for fast expresses that by-passed the congested Metropolitan Railway tracks. It ran between [[Neasden Junction]], south of Wembley, and Northolt Junction, west of London, where a new joint main line with the [[Great Western Railway]] began. Local passenger services from [[Marylebone railway station|London Marylebone]] were added from March 1906, when new stations were opened, including 'Wembley Hill', next to what later became the site of Wembley Stadium \u2013 the national stadium of English sport \u2013 which opened for the [[1923 FA Cup Final|FA Cup Final]] of April 1923, remaining open for 77 years until it closed for reconstruction in October 2000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wembleystadium.com/gloriouspast/historyintroduction|title=404 - Page not found - wembleystadium.com|last=TheFA|access-date=9 October 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101017232053/http://www.wembleystadium.com/GloriousPast/historyIntroduction|archive-date=17 October 2010|url-status=dead}}</ref> After a long planning and redevelopment process dogged by a series of funding problems and construction delays, the new stadium finally opened its doors in March 2007.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/london/6459415.stm | work=BBC News | title=Doors finally open at new Wembley | date=17 March 2007}}</ref>\n\nWembley Hill station was renamed 'Wembley Complex' in May 1978, before getting its present name of '[[Wembley Stadium railway station|Wembley Stadium]]' in May 1987.<ref>{{Cite book|last1=Mitchell |first1=Vic |last2=Smith |first2=Keith |title=Marylebone to Rickmansworth |series=Midland Main Lines |date=February 2005 |publisher=Middleton Press |location=Midhurst |isbn=1-904474-49-7 |chapter=Figure 51 }}</ref>\n\n[[File:GB British Empire Exhibition Postage Stamps.jpg|thumb|British Empire Exhibition postage stamps]]\n\nThe area around the current Wembley Stadium was the location of the [[British Empire Exhibition]]<ref>[http://disused-rlys.fotopic.net/p49262227.html Photograph of exhibition site]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>[http://disused-rlys.fotopic.net/p49002875.html Map of exhibition site]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>[http://www.tribuneindia.com/2004/20040905/spectrum/art.htm Sunday Tribune of India (newspaper)] Article on exhibition (2004)</ref> of 1924\u20131925.<ref>[http://www.britishpathe.com/record.php?id=75167 British Pathe (agency)] Film of British Empire Exhibition, reel one</ref><ref>[http://www.britishpathe.com/record.php?id=75168 British Pathe (agency)] Film of British Empire Exhibition, reel two</ref><ref>[http://www.britishpathe.com/record.php?id=75169 British Pathe (agency)] Film of British Empire Exhibition, reel three</ref><ref>[http://www.britishpathe.com/record.php?id=75170 British Pathe (agency)] Film of British Empire Exhibition, reel four</ref> Until the 2000s, remnants of the many [[reinforced concrete]] buildings, including the [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|original Wembley Stadium]], remained, but nearly all have now been removed, to make way for redevelopment.\n\nWembley, in common with much of northwest London, had an extensive manufacturing industry, but much of it closed in the 1980s.

During the 1960s, rebuilding of Wembley Central station, a block of flats, an open-plan shopping plaza, and a car park were constructed on a concrete raft over the railway.\n\nThe shopping plaza suffered slow decline and was therefore poorly maintained. Eventually in the 2000s, plans were approved to completely regenerate the place, carried out by construction company St. Modwen. The first phase, including construction of eighty-five homes, reconstruction of the plaza as a new [[public square]] and opening of new retail units including a [[TK Maxx]], was completed in 2009.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.brentbrain.org.uk/brain/brainzones.nsf/nsgnews/NT00056C82 | title=Public square reopens in Wembley Central|last=Brent Resource and Information Network (BRAIN)|publisher=Brent Council|accessdate=25 October 2009}}</ref><ref>https://www.stmodwen.co.uk/new-public-square-launched-at-wembley-central/</ref> The rest was completed in 2015 after nine years' time, with additional retail and housing units.<ref>https://www.mylondon.news/news/business/wembley-central-invites-you-fun-filled-8912022</ref> The local [[Argos (retailer)|Argos]] store also moved to a new space in the redeveloped area. Extensive redevelopment has also occurred separately in the [[Wembley Park]] area (around the stadium), about a mile northeast from Wembley town centre.\n\nMost of the rest of Wembley's housing consists of inter-war semi-detached houses and terraces and of modern apartment blocks, with a significant minority of detached housing.\n\nThere also used to be a [[British Army]] recruitment centre off the High Road in Wembley. This centre came under attack by an [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|IRA]] bomb in 1990 resulting in the death of a soldier and injuries to four people (see [[1990 Wembley bombing]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newspapers.com/newspage/257998235/|title=The Observer from London,  on June 3, 1990 \u00b7 3}}</ref>\n\n==Governance==\n[[File:cmglee_London_Wembley_aerial.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of Wembley and its stadium]]\nWembley formed part of the large ancient parish of [[Harrow on the Hill]] in the [[Gore (hundred)|Gore]] hundred of [[Middlesex]]. In 1894 Wembley was split from Harrow, creating a new parish and [[Urban district (Great Britain and Ireland)|urban district]]. It included [[Alperton]], [[Preston, London|Preston]], [[North Wembley]], [[South Kenton]], [[Tokyngton]], [[Sudbury, London|Sudbury]], [[Wembley Park]] and [[Northwick Park]]. The urban district included the neighbouring parish of [[Kingsbury, London|Kingsbury]] until 1901 and again from 1934.\n\nIn 1937 it was incorporated as the [[Municipal Borough of Wembley]]. The fire brigade headquarters of [[Middlesex County Council]] were located on Harrow Road and is now a fire station of the [[London Fire Brigade]]. [[Brent Town Hall|Wembley Town Hall]] on Forty Lane, built in 1938, became [[Brent Town Hall]] when the municipal boroughs of Wembley and [[Municipal Borough of Willesden|Willesden]] were amalgamated in 1965 to form the [[London Borough of Brent]] and transferred to [[Greater London]]. Since the 2010 elections, Brent Council has been controlled by the Labour Party.\n\nWembley falls within the UK Parliament constituency of [[Brent North (UK Parliament constituency)|Brent North]] and the London Assembly constituency of [[Brent and Harrow (London Assembly constituency)|Brent and Harrow]].\n\n==Geography==\nUntil the nineteenth century, Wembley was rural and the sector retains a number of green spaces. These include Barham Park (10.5 hectares) in Sudbury Town, King Edward VII Park, established in 1914 behind the High Road (10.5 hectares), and Sudbury Green.  Less managed spaces include Fryent Country Park, Barn Hill (19.87 hectares), and Vale Farm sports ground (30 hectares). Brent River Park / Tokyngton Recreation Ground (20.26 hectares) has recently been restored, returning the river to a more natural course.\n\nNearby Sudbury Golf Course backs onto the [[Grand Union Canal]], with its towpath running into central London. Sudbury Squash and Tennis Club has outdoor tennis courts, an indoor squash court, and a clubhouse. Wembley is a short distance away from the [[Brent Reservoir|Welsh Harp]] reservoir and open space, created in the early 19th century by damming the [[River Brent]] to provide water for the [[Grand Union Canal]].\n\nThe area is identified in the [[Mayor of London]]'s [[London Plan]] as one of thirty-five major centres in Greater London.<ref name=London_plan_f08>{{cite web|url=http://www.london.gov.uk/thelondonplan/docs/londonplan08.pdf | author=[[Mayor of London]] | publisher=[[Greater London Authority]] | title=London Plan (Consolidated with Alterations since 2004) |date=February 2008 }}</ref>\n\nWembley is made up of six wards: [[Wembley Central (ward)|Wembley Central]], [[Alperton]], [[Tokyngton]], Barnhill, [[Preston, London|Preston]] and [[Sudbury, London|Sudbury]].

Unlike typical British [[high street]]s however, Wembley lacks a town centre network or pedestrianised high streets, with almost all commercial high street businesses located along a 1000-yard stretch of road (High Road). In 1971 the High Road was seen as being the 11th best place to shop in London. However, it had fallen to 24th place by 1987.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.brent.gov.uk/media/387392/Wembley.pdf|title=Places in Brent Wembley and Tokyngton|last=Barres-Baker|first=M.C.|website=|access-date=2016-07-03}}</ref> Ealing Road remains important as a centre of South Asian jewellery and gold shops,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/2764476/Rallying-to-the-gold-standard.html|title=Rallying to the gold standard|access-date=2016-07-03}}</ref> attracting people from as far afield as [[Leicester]], but otherwise the focus of shopping has shifted north and east to the more recent development of [[London Designer Outlet]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.londondesigneroutlet.com/whats-on/in-wembley-park|title=Enjoy more things to do in Wembley Park / London Designer Outlet|website=www.londondesigneroutlet.com|access-date=2016-07-03}}</ref> in [[Wembley Park]], which is part of the Stadium's complex and also includes a fully pedestrianised street near the Stadium.

The cathedral, dedicated to the [[Assumption of the Virgin Mary]],  is the seat of the [[bishop of Padua]]. The church building, first erected as seat of a bishop of the diocese in the 4th century, has undergone major reconstructions over the centuries.\n\n==History==\nThe present church is the third structure built on the same site. The first cathedra was erected after the [[Edict of Milan]] in 313 and destroyed by an earthquake on 3 January 1117. It was rebuilt in [[Romanesque architecture|Romanesque]] style: the appearance of that medieval church can be seen in the frescoes by [[Giusto de' Menabuoi]] in the adjoining [[baptistery]]. The current building dates from a reconstruction during the sixteenth century. While in the past the design was attributed to [[Michelangelo]], it was performed rather by [[Andrea della Valle]] and [[Agostino Righetto]], and has much in common with earlier Paduan churches. Construction began on the new [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]] building in 1551 and went on for two centuries, being completed in 1754, yet leaving the fa\u00e7ade unfinished.\n\nThe Cathedral Basilica of Santa Maria Assunta is dedicated to the Assumption of Mary, and has the dignity of [[minor basilica]].<ref>http://www.gcatholic.org/churches/italy/0091.htm Basilica Cattedrale di S.

A pillar of stone surmounted by a cross marks its location in the current churchyard. During a restoration (ca 462 or 602) the [[Episcopal see]] of Patavium was joined to that of Santa Maria. Bishop Tricidio restored the cathedral in 620 and it was again rebuilt between 899-900 due to a fire. In 1075 the Bishop Olderico consecrated the new cathedral on the ruins of the previous church. For this last step construction, later historians suppose that the facade was located to the east, with a confession and a crypt under the apse where bishop Tricidio is buried.  His tombstone was discovered during the excavation of the foundations. This basilica collapsed during the 3 January 1117 earthquake.<ref name=wiki-it/>\n\nExcavation and research by the Chair of Medieval Archeology at the University of Padua between 2011 and 2012 has expanded knowledge of the entire area around the Episcopal Palace, the Cathedral, and the Baptistery. In the north-east corner of the churchyard, they found the base of a tower with a square plan (10x10 metres; 33x33 ft.) Romanesque style from between the 10th and 12th century.  The excavations found the foundations of buildings from between the ninth and eleventh century.  North of the baptistery are a series of mosaic pavements from the fourth and the fifth centuries.  Among the finds are: a sarcophagus in stone for relics, a Lacerta altar dating from the fifth or sixth century, fragments of liturgical furnishings from various eras, graves (56 individuals), and traces of home workshops from the [[Longobard]] age.<ref name=wiki-it/>\n\n===The cathedral of Macillo===\n[[File:Padova duomo presbiterio.jpg|thumb|Presbytery of Padua Cathedral]]As a result of the earthquake of 1117, a new cathedral was erected by architect Macillo, it is not clear whether on the ruins of the cathedral of Olderico or to a new location; it opens onto a piazza and churchyard.

Inside the nave the aisles were divided by columns and pillars, alternative in the [[Ottonian]] tradition. In 1227 the campanile was rebuilt.  Bishop Stephen from Carrara promoted some restoration and embellishment of the vaults (1399 and 1400).<ref name=wiki-it/>\n\n===The new cathedral===\nBishop Peter Barozzi wanted to modernize the church with the construction of a new, great presbytery. <!-- second way et structure romanae ecclesiae Saint Peter, the project by Bernardo Rossellino for the choir of St. Peter's Basilica. -->The first stone was blessed and placed in the foundation 6 May 1522 by Cardinal Francis Pisani, who with the Canons and the prebendati funded the reconstruction. The project continued over two centuries. On 2 January 1551 the chapter of canons approved the model for the presbytery by [[Michelangelo Buonarroti]] to replace that of [[Jacopo Sansovino]]. The design of Michelangelo was completed within the next few decades. The presbytery was inaugurated by Bishop Federico Cornaro on 14 April 1582. Cornaro had to remove the old medieval bell tower initiated by Cardinal Pisani. The old facade was extended and adorned. Toward 1635 the construction of the right arm of the transept was begun and in 1693 the left side.  The remains of the old cathedral were gradually removed and the new nave, designed by [[Gerolamo Frigimelica]] and [[Francesco Maria Preti]], as well as Giambattista Novello, built on the same site. The cathedral was consecrated on 25 August  1754 by [[Cardinal Carlo Rezzonico]]. It was then designated a [[minor basilica]]. Construction of the dome began in 1756 under the direction of John Glory and Giorgio Massari.<ref name=wiki-it/>\n\n==Exterior==\n[[File:Abside Cattedrale Padova.jpg|thumb|Apse, dome and bell tower of the Cathedral of Padua.]] The Basilica of Santa Maria Assunta stands between the episcopal palace and the Baptistery. It is a [[Latin cross]] with three bays and an octagonal dome. The dome of the Glory is covered in lead. Two [[sacristies]] adjoin the presbytery, one for the Canons and the other for the Prebendati. Between the Prebendati sacristy and the transept is the bell tower. The side doors open onto a small courtyard for the presbytery and onto the Via Duomo, by the carriage entrance to the Episcopal palace. On the bell tower is a plaque from the Roman era that mentions the Gens Fabia of Veio, a title in the history of Padua from 49 B.C.<ref name=wiki-it/>\nThe facade onto which open the three portals is incomplete.

In the second chapel, the altarpiece depicts the ''Martyrdom of San Lorenzo'' by [[Alessandro Galvano]]. The chapel of San Lorenzo Giustiniani has an altarpiece commissioned by Bishop Nicholas Antonio Giustiniani to honor his ancestor. The bishop is buried in the chapel. The white marble statue (1788) was sculpted by Felice Chiereghin. The altarpiece depicting the ''Virgin and saints'' is attributed to [[Alessandro Varotari]] \"the Padovanino\". The walls' epigraphs and the remains of episcopalian funerary monuments belonged to the Macilliana cathedral. From 1809, behind the altar, hidden by a marble slab, is the body of San Leolino bishop of Padua, previously venerated in the church of San Leolino in Pr\u00e0 della Valle. At the next altar is a modern representation of the Sacred Heart (R. Mulata), replacing ''San Carlo Borromeo in prayer'' by [[Giovanni Battista Bissoni]] which was removed to the [[Basilica of Saint Anthony of Padua]].
