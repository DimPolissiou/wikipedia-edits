As the vesicle acidifies, ''B. pseudomallei'' uses its [[Bacterial secretion system#Type III secretion system (T3SS or TTSS)|Type 3 secretion system]] (T3SS) to inject effector proteins into the host cell, disrupting the vesicle and allowing the bacteria to escape into the host [[cytoplasm]].<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Within the host cytoplasm, the bacteria evade being killed by host [[autophagy]] using various T3SS effector proteins, including BopA.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> The bacteria replicate in the host cytoplasm.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\nInside the host cell, the bacteria move by inducing the polymerization of host [[actin]] behind them, propelling the bacteria forward.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> This actin-mediated motility is accomplished with the [[Secretion#Type V secretion system .28T5SS.29|autotransporter]] BimA which interacts with actin at the tail-end of the bacterium.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Propelled by actin, the bacteria push against the host membrane, creating protusions that extend into neighbouring cells. These protrusions cause neighboring cells to fuse, leading to the formation of [[multinucleated giant cells]] (MNGCs). When MNGCs lyse, they form plaques (a central clear area with a ring of fused cells) which provide shelter for the bacteria for further replication or [[latent infection]]. This same process in infected neurons can allow bacteria to travel through nerve roots in the spinal cord and brain, leading to [[encephalomyelitis|inflammation of the brain and spinal cord]].<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Besides spreading from cell to cell, the bacteria can also spread through the blood stream, causing sepsis. The bacteria can survive in [[antigen-presenting cell]]s and [[dendritic cell]]s. Thus, these cells acts as vehicles that transport the bacteria into the lymphatic system, causing widespread dissemination of the bacteria in the human body.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\nWhile ''B. pseudomallei'' can survive in phagocytic cells, these cells can kill ''B. pseudomallei'' by several mechanisms. Macrophages activated by [[interferon gamma]] (IFN) have improved killing of ''B. pseudomallei'' via the production of [[Nitric oxide synthase#iNOS|inducible nitric oxide synthase]].<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Acidification of the endosome and degradation of the bacteria is also possible, however the bacterial capsule and LPS makes ''B. pseudomallei'' resistant to lysosomal degradation. Once ''B. pseudomallei'' escapes into the host cytosol it can be recognized by [[pattern recognition receptor]]s such as [[NOD-like receptor]]s, triggering formation of the [[inflammasome]] and activation of [[caspase 1]], which induces death of the host cell by [[pyroptosis]] and further activation of the immune system.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Several systemic host defenses also contribute to the immune response. ''B. pseudomallei'' triggers both the [[complement system]] and [[coagulation cascade]], however the thick bacterial capsule prevents deposition of the [[complement membrane attack complex]].<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\nAdditional elements of the immune system are activated by host [[toll-like receptor]]s such as TLR2, TLR4, and TLR5 that recognize the [[pathogen-associated molecular pattern|conserved piece]]s of the bacteria such as LPS and flagella. This activation results in the production of [[cytokine]]s such as [[Interleukin 1 beta]] (IL-1\u03b2) and [[Interleukin 18]] (IL-18).<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>  IL-18 increases IFN production through [[natural killer cell]]s while IL-1beta reduces the IFN production. These immune molecules drive the recruitment of other immune cells such as [[neutrophil]]s, [[dendritic cell]]s, [[B cell]]s, and [[T cell]]s to the site of infection.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> T cells seem to be particularly important for controlling ''B. pseudomallei''; T cell numbers are increased in survivors, and low T cell numbers is associated with a high risk of death from melioidosis.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Despite this, HIV infection is not a risk factor for melioidosis. Although macrophages show deregulated [[cytokine]] responses in individuals with HIV infection, bacterial internalization and intracellular killing are still effective.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> People infected with ''B. pseudomallei'' do develop antibodies against the bacteria, and people that live in endemic areas tend to have antibodies in their blood that recognize ''B. pseudomallei''. However, the effectiveness of these antibodies at preventing melioidosis is unclear.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\n''B. pseudomallei'' can remain latent in the human body from 19 to 29 years until it is reactivated during human [[immunosuppression]] or stress response.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> However, the site of bacteria during latent infection and the mechanism by which they avoid immune recognition for years are both unclear.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Amongst mechanisms suggested are: residing in the nucleus of the cell to prevent being digested, entering a stage of slower growth, antibiotic resistance, and genetic adaption to the host environment.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> [[Granuloma]]s (containing neutrophils, macrophages, lymphocytes, and multinucleated giant cells) formed at the infection site in melioidosis have been associated with latent infection in humans.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\n==Diagnosis==\n[[File:Bps close.JPG|thumb|upright=1.3|Appearance of ''B. pseudomallei'' colonies on Ashdown's medium after four days of incubation.]]\n[[File:Immunofluorescent-stained sample of guinea pig tissue leads to positive diagnosis of melioidosis.png|thumb|upright=1.3|Immunofluorescent microscopy showing the presence of ''B. pseudomallei''.]]\n[[File:Latex agglutination test positive for melioidosis.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Left most slide showing positive latex agglutination for melioidosis.]]\n\nBacterial culture is the definitive diagnosis of melioidosis. ''B. pseudomallei'' is never part of human flora. Therefore, any growth of the bacteria is diagnostic of melioidosis. Blood cultures are the most common samples for diagnosis, as bacteria can be detected in the blood in 50 to 60% of melioidosis cases. Other samples such as throat, rectal swabs, pus from abscesses, and sputum can also be used for culture. When bacteria do not grow from people strongly suspected of having melioidosis, repeated cultures should be taken as subsequent cultures can become positive.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> ''B. pseudomallei'' can be grown on sheep blood agar, [[MacConkey agar]], [[Ashdown's medium]] (containing [[gentamicin]]),<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> or Ashdown's broth (containing [[colistin]]).<ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/> Agar plates for melioidosis should be incubated at 37&nbsp;\u00b0C (98.6&nbsp;\u00b0F) in air <ref name=\"Yi 2014\"/> and inspected daily for four days. On the agar plates, ''B. pseudomallei'' forms creamy, [[Hemolysis (microbiology)|non-haemolytic]], colonies after 2 days of incubation. After 4 days of incubation, colonies appear dry and wrinkled.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Colonies of ''B. pseudomallei'' that are grown on Francis medium (a modification of Ashdown medium with gentamicin concentration increased to 8&nbsp;mg/L) are yellow. For laboratories located outside endemic areas, ''Burkholderia cepacia'' selective agar or ''Pseudomonas'' selective agar can be used if Ashdown's medium is not available.<ref name=\"Yi 2014\"/> It is important not misinterpret the bacterial growth as ''[[Pseudomonas]]'' or ''[[Bacillus]]'' spp. Other biochemical screening tools can also be used for detecting ''B. pseudomallei'', including the [[analytical profile index|API 20NE or 20E biochemical kit]] combined with Gram stain, [[oxidase test]], typical growth characteristics, and resistance to certain antibiotics of the bacteria.<ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/> Molecular methods such as 16S rDNA probes and [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) can also be used to detect ''B. pseudomallei'' in culture, but they are only available in research and reference laboratories.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\nGeneral blood tests in people with melioidosis show low white blood cell counts (indicates infection), raised liver enzymes, increased [[bilirubin]] levels (indicates liver dysfunction), and raised urea and creatinine levels (indicates kidney dysfunction).<ref name=\"Allen C 2005\"/> [[Hypoglycemia|Low blood glucose]] and [[acidosis]] predicts a poorer prognosis in those with melioidosis.<ref name=\"Allen C 2005\"/> However, other tests such as [[C-reactive protein]] and [[procalcitonin]] levels are not reliable in predicting the severity of melioidosis infection.<ref name=\"Allen C 2005\"/>\n\nBy microscopy, ''B. pseudomallei'' is seen as [[Gram stain|gram-negative]] and rod-shaped, with a bipolar staining similar in appearance to a safety pin. Bacteria can sometimes be seen directly in clinical samples from infected people; however, identification by light microscopy is neither [[Sensitivity and specificity|specific]] nor [[Sensitivity and specificity|sensitive]]. [[Immunofluorescence microscopy]] is highly specific for detecting bacteria directly from clinical specimens, but has less than 50% sensitivity.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/><ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/> A lateral flow immunoassay has been developed but not extensively evaluated.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/><ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/> An increasing number of laboratories use [[Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization]] (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry to identify the bacteria accurately.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/><ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/>\n\n[[serology|Serological test]]s such as indirect [[haemagglutination assay|haemagglutination]] have been used to detect the presence of antibodies against ''B. pseudomallei''. However, different groups of people have widely different levels of antibodies, so interpretation of these tests depends on location. In Australia, less than 5% of people have ''B. pseudomallei'' antibodies, so the presence of even relatively low amounts of antibody is unusual and could suggest melioidosis. In Thailand, many people have antibodies against ''B. pseudomallei'' so only a relatively high amount of antibody in the blood suggests melioidosis.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/><ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/> Thailand also uses [[Direct fluorescent antibody|direct immunofluorescent antibody test]] (IFAT) and latex agglutination.  In IFAT, both ''B. pseudomallei'' antigen and ''B. thailandensis'' can be used to quantify the amount of antibodies produced against the bacteria. Therefore, the results have to be interpreted with caution as there could be a false-positive reaction if someone is previously exposed to non-pathogenic ''B. thailandensis''.<ref name=\"Yi 2014\"/> [[Latex agglutination]] is useful in screening for suspected ''B. pseudomallei'' colonies.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> A commercial [[ELISA]] kit for melioidosis appears to perform well.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Limmathurotsakul D, Chantratita N, Teerawattanasook N, et al |title= Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay for the Diagnosis of Melioidosis: Better Than We Thought|journal=Clinical Infectious Diseases|year=2011|volume=52|issue=8|pages=1024&ndash;1028|pmid=21460318|doi=10.1093/cid/cir080|pmc=3070030}}</ref> but no ELISA test has yet been clinically validated as a diagnostic tool.<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Peacock SJ, Cheng AC, Currie BJ, Dance DA|title=The Use of Positive Serological Tests as Evidence of Exposure to ''Burkholderia pseudomallei''|journal=American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene|year=2011|volume=84|issue=6|pages= 1021&ndash;1022|pmid=21633045|doi=10.4269/ajtmh.2011.11-0114a| pmc=3110358}}</ref>\n\nIt is not possible to diagnose melioidosis on imaging studies alone<ref name=\"Lim2010\">{{cite journal|vauthors=Lim KS, Chong VH |title=Radiological manifestations of melioidosis|journal=Clinical Radiology|year=2010|volume=65|issue=1|pmid=20103424|pages=66&ndash;72|doi=10.1016/j.crad.2009.08.008}}</ref> (such as [[X-rays]], ultrasound, and CT scans),<ref name=\"Yi 2014\"/><ref name=\"Lim2010\"/> but imaging is routinely performed to assess the extent of disease spread.<ref name=\"Muttarak2008\">{{cite journal|vauthors=Muttarak M, Peh WC, Euathrongchit J, Lin SE, Tan AG, Lerttumnongtum P, Sivasomboon C |title=Spectrum of imaging findings in melioidosis|journal= British Journal of Radiology|year=2008|pmid=19098086|volume=82|issue=978|pages=514\u2013521|doi=10.1259/bjr/15785231}}</ref> Imaging of the abdomen using CT scans or ultrasound is recommended routinely, as abscesses may not be clinically apparent and may coexist with disease elsewhere.

They subsequently developed melioidosis pneumonia. Involvement of lymph nodes in the [[mediastinum]] can occur in pneumonia caused by melioidosis. Animal studies have also shown that inhalation is associated with a high rate of death.<ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/>\n\n==Pathogenesis==\n''B. pseudomallei'' has the ability to infect various types of cells and to evade human immune responses.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Bacteria first enter at a break in the skin or [[mucous membrane]] and replicate in the epithelial cells.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> From there, they use [[flagella]]r motility to spread and infect various cell types. In the blood stream, the bacteria can infect both [[phagocyte]]s and non-phagocytes. ''B. pseudomallei'' use their flagella to move near [[Host (biology)|host]] cells, then attach to the cells using various adhesion proteins, including the [[type IV pilus]] protein PilA as well as adhesion proteins BoaA and BoaB. Additionally, adhesion of the bacteria partially depends on the presence of the host protein [[Coagulation factor II receptor|Protease-activated receptor-1]] which is present on the surface of [[endothelial cell]]s, [[platelet]]s, and [[monocyte]]s.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Once bound, the bacteria enter host cells through [[endocytosis]], ending up inside an endocytic [[Vesicle (biology and chemistry)|vesicle]]. As the vesicle acidifies, ''B. pseudomallei'' uses its [[Bacterial secretion system#Type III secretion system (T3SS or TTSS)|Type 3 secretion system]] (T3SS) to inject effector proteins into the host cell, disrupting the vesicle and allowing the bacteria to escape into the host [[cytoplasm]].<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Within the host cytoplasm, the bacteria evade being killed by host [[autophagy]] using various T3SS effector proteins, including BopA.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> The bacteria replicate in the host cytoplasm.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\nInside the host cell, the bacteria move by inducing the polymerization of host [[actin]] behind them, propelling the bacteria forward.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> This actin-mediated motility is accomplished with the [[Secretion#Type V secretion system .28T5SS.29|autotransporter]] BimA which interacts with actin at the tail-end of the bacterium.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Propelled by actin, the bacteria push against the host membrane, creating protusions that extend into neighbouring cells. These protrusions cause neighboring cells to fuse, leading to the formation of [[multinucleated giant cells]] (MNGCs). When MNGCs lyse, they form plaques (a central clear area with a ring of fused cells) which provide shelter for the bacteria for further replication or [[latent infection]]. This same process in infected neurons can allow bacteria to travel through nerve roots in the spinal cord and brain, leading to [[encephalomyelitis|inflammation of the brain and spinal cord]].<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Besides spreading from cell to cell, the bacteria can also spread through the blood stream, causing sepsis. The bacteria can survive in [[antigen-presenting cell]]s and [[dendritic cell]]s. Thus, these cells acts as vehicles that transport the bacteria into the lymphatic system, causing widespread dissemination of the bacteria in the human body.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\nWhile ''B. pseudomallei'' can survive in phagocytic cells, these cells can kill ''B. pseudomallei'' by several mechanisms. Macrophages activated by [[interferon gamma]] (IFN) have improved killing of ''B. pseudomallei'' via the production of [[Nitric oxide synthase#iNOS|inducible nitric oxide synthase]].<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Acidification of the endosome and degradation of the bacteria is also possible, however the bacterial capsule and LPS makes ''B. pseudomallei'' resistant to lysosomal degradation. Once ''B. pseudomallei'' escapes into the host cytosol it can be recognized by [[pattern recognition receptor]]s such as [[NOD-like receptor]]s, triggering formation of the [[inflammasome]] and activation of [[caspase 1]], which induces death of the host cell by [[pyroptosis]] and further activation of the immune system.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Several systemic host defenses also contribute to the immune response. ''B. pseudomallei'' triggers both the [[complement system]] and [[coagulation cascade]], however the thick bacterial capsule prevents deposition of the [[complement membrane attack complex]].<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\nAdditional elements of the immune system are activated by host [[toll-like receptor]]s such as TLR2, TLR4, and TLR5 that recognize the [[pathogen-associated molecular pattern|conserved piece]]s of the bacteria such as LPS and flagella. This activation results in the production of [[cytokine]]s such as [[Interleukin 1 beta]] (IL-1\u03b2) and [[Interleukin 18]] (IL-18).<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>  IL-18 increases IFN production through [[natural killer cell]]s while IL-1beta reduces the IFN production. These immune molecules drive the recruitment of other immune cells such as [[neutrophil]]s, [[dendritic cell]]s, [[B cell]]s, and [[T cell]]s to the site of infection.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> T cells seem to be particularly important for controlling ''B. pseudomallei''; T cell numbers are increased in survivors, and low T cell numbers is associated with a high risk of death from melioidosis.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Despite this, HIV infection is not a risk factor for melioidosis. Although macrophages show deregulated [[cytokine]] responses in individuals with HIV infection, bacterial internalization and intracellular killing are still effective.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> People infected with ''B. pseudomallei'' do develop antibodies against the bacteria, and people that live in endemic areas tend to have antibodies in their blood that recognize ''B. pseudomallei''. However, the effectiveness of these antibodies at preventing melioidosis is unclear.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\n''B. pseudomallei'' can remain latent in the human body from 19 to 29 years until it is reactivated during human [[immunosuppression]] or stress response.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> However, the site of bacteria during latent infection and the mechanism by which they avoid immune recognition for years are both unclear.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Amongst mechanisms suggested are: residing in the nucleus of the cell to prevent being digested, entering a stage of slower growth, antibiotic resistance, and genetic adaption to the host environment.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> [[Granuloma]]s (containing neutrophils, macrophages, lymphocytes, and multinucleated giant cells) formed at the infection site in melioidosis have been associated with latent infection in humans.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\n==Diagnosis==\n[[File:Bps close.JPG|thumb|upright=1.3|Appearance of ''B. pseudomallei'' colonies on Ashdown's medium after four days of incubation.]]\n[[File:Immunofluorescent-stained sample of guinea pig tissue leads to positive diagnosis of melioidosis.png|thumb|upright=1.3|Immunofluorescent microscopy showing the presence of ''B. pseudomallei''.]]\n[[File:Latex agglutination test positive for melioidosis.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|Left most slide showing positive latex agglutination for melioidosis.]]\n\nBacterial culture is the definitive diagnosis of melioidosis. ''B. pseudomallei'' is never part of human flora. Therefore, any growth of the bacteria is diagnostic of melioidosis. Blood cultures are the most common samples for diagnosis, as bacteria can be detected in the blood in 50 to 60% of melioidosis cases. Other samples such as throat, rectal swabs, pus from abscesses, and sputum can also be used for culture. When bacteria do not grow from people strongly suspected of having melioidosis, repeated cultures should be taken as subsequent cultures can become positive.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> ''B. pseudomallei'' can be grown on sheep blood agar, [[MacConkey agar]], [[Ashdown's medium]] (containing [[gentamicin]]),<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> or Ashdown's broth (containing [[colistin]]).<ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/> Agar plates for melioidosis should be incubated at 37&nbsp;\u00b0C (98.6&nbsp;\u00b0F) in air <ref name=\"Yi 2014\"/> and inspected daily for four days. On the agar plates, ''B. pseudomallei'' forms creamy, [[Hemolysis (microbiology)|non-haemolytic]], colonies after 2 days of incubation. After 4 days of incubation, colonies appear dry and wrinkled.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Colonies of ''B. pseudomallei'' that are grown on Francis medium (a modification of Ashdown medium with gentamicin concentration increased to 8&nbsp;mg/L) are yellow. For laboratories located outside endemic areas, ''Burkholderia cepacia'' selective agar or ''Pseudomonas'' selective agar can be used if Ashdown's medium is not available.<ref name=\"Yi 2014\"/> It is important not misinterpret the bacterial growth as ''[[Pseudomonas]]'' or ''[[Bacillus]]'' spp. Other biochemical screening tools can also be used for detecting ''B. pseudomallei'', including the [[analytical profile index|API 20NE or 20E biochemical kit]] combined with Gram stain, [[oxidase test]], typical growth characteristics, and resistance to certain antibiotics of the bacteria.<ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/> Molecular methods such as 16S rDNA probes and [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) can also be used to detect ''B. pseudomallei'' in culture, but they are only available in research and reference laboratories.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\nGeneral blood tests in people with melioidosis show low white blood cell counts (indicates infection), raised liver enzymes, increased [[bilirubin]] levels (indicates liver dysfunction), and raised urea and creatinine levels (indicates kidney dysfunction).<ref name=\"Allen C 2005\"/> [[Hypoglycemia|Low blood glucose]] and [[acidosis]] predicts a poorer prognosis in those with melioidosis.<ref name=\"Allen C 2005\"/> However, other tests such as [[C-reactive protein]] and [[procalcitonin]] levels are not reliable in predicting the severity of melioidosis infection.<ref name=\"Allen C 2005\"/>\n\nBy microscopy, ''B. pseudomallei'' is seen as [[Gram stain|gram-negative]] and rod-shaped, with a bipolar staining similar in appearance to a safety pin. Bacteria can sometimes be seen directly in clinical samples from infected people; however, identification by light microscopy is neither [[Sensitivity and specificity|specific]] nor [[Sensitivity and specificity|sensitive]]. [[Immunofluorescence microscopy]] is highly specific for detecting bacteria directly from clinical specimens, but has less than 50% sensitivity.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/><ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/> A lateral flow immunoassay has been developed but not extensively evaluated.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/><ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/> An increasing number of laboratories use [[Matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization]] (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry to identify the bacteria accurately.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/><ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/>\n\n[[serology|Serological test]]s such as indirect [[haemagglutination assay|haemagglutination]] have been used to detect the presence of antibodies against ''B. pseudomallei''. However, different groups of people have widely different levels of antibodies, so interpretation of these tests depends on location. In Australia, less than 5% of people have ''B. pseudomallei'' antibodies, so the presence of even relatively low amounts of antibody is unusual and could suggest melioidosis. In Thailand, many people have antibodies against ''B. pseudomallei'' so only a relatively high amount of antibody in the blood suggests melioidosis.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/><ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/> Thailand also uses [[Direct fluorescent antibody|direct immunofluorescent antibody test]] (IFAT) and latex agglutination.  In IFAT, both ''B. pseudomallei'' antigen and ''B. thailandensis'' can be used to quantify the amount of antibodies produced against the bacteria. Therefore, the results have to be interpreted with caution as there could be a false-positive reaction if someone is previously exposed to non-pathogenic ''B. thailandensis''.<ref name=\"Yi 2014\"/> [[Latex agglutination]] is useful in screening for suspected ''B. pseudomallei'' colonies.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> A commercial [[ELISA]] kit for melioidosis appears to perform well.<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Limmathurotsakul D, Chantratita N, Teerawattanasook N, et al |title= Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay for the Diagnosis of Melioidosis: Better Than We Thought|journal=Clinical Infectious Diseases|year=2011|volume=52|issue=8|pages=1024&ndash;1028|pmid=21460318|doi=10.1093/cid/cir080|pmc=3070030}}</ref> but no ELISA test has yet been clinically validated as a diagnostic tool.<ref>{{cite journal|vauthors=Peacock SJ, Cheng AC, Currie BJ, Dance DA|title=The Use of Positive Serological Tests as Evidence of Exposure to ''Burkholderia pseudomallei''|journal=American Journal of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene|year=2011|volume=84|issue=6|pages= 1021&ndash;1022|pmid=21633045|doi=10.4269/ajtmh.2011.11-0114a| pmc=3110358}}</ref>\n\nIt is not possible to diagnose melioidosis on imaging studies alone<ref name=\"Lim2010\">{{cite journal|vauthors=Lim KS, Chong VH |title=Radiological manifestations of melioidosis|journal=Clinical Radiology|year=2010|volume=65|issue=1|pmid=20103424|pages=66&ndash;72|doi=10.1016/j.crad.2009.08.008}}</ref> (such as [[X-rays]], ultrasound, and CT scans),<ref name=\"Yi 2014\"/><ref name=\"Lim2010\"/> but imaging is routinely performed to assess the extent of disease spread.<ref name=\"Muttarak2008\">{{cite journal|vauthors=Muttarak M, Peh WC, Euathrongchit J, Lin SE, Tan AG, Lerttumnongtum P, Sivasomboon C |title=Spectrum of imaging findings in melioidosis|journal= British Journal of Radiology|year=2008|pmid=19098086|volume=82|issue=978|pages=514\u2013521|doi=10.1259/bjr/15785231}}</ref> Imaging of the abdomen using CT scans or ultrasound is recommended routinely, as abscesses may not be clinically apparent and may coexist with disease elsewhere.

Those who are at high risk of contact with the bacteria should wear protective gear (such as boots and gloves) during work.

There are no differences between using cefoperazone/sulbactam or ceftazidime to treat melioidosis as both show similar death rates and disease progression following treatment.<ref name=\"Yi 2014\"/> For those with kidney impairment, the dosage of ceftazidime, meropenem, and co-trimoxazole should be lowered.<ref name=\"Currie 2015\"/> Once the clinical condition improved, meropenem can be switched back to ceftazidime.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\n===Eradication phase===\nFollowing the treatment of the acute disease, eradication (or maintenance) treatment with [[co-trimoxazole]] is the drug of choice and should be used for at least 3 months. For those with neurological melioidosis and [[osteomyelitis]], drugs should be given for more than 6 months. Co-amoxiclav and [[doxycycline]] are drugs of second choice. Co-trimoxazole should not be used in those with [[glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase]] deficiency as it can cause [[haemolytic anemia]]. Other side effects such as rash, [[hyperkalemia]], renal dysfunction, and gastrointestinal symptoms should prompt the reduction of co-trimoxazole doses.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> [[Chloramphenicol]] is no longer routinely recommended for this purpose.

Meanwhile, in Thailand, co-amoxiclav is the drug of choice for children and pregnant women. However, ''B. pseudomallei'' often acquires resistance when this drug is used.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> The dosing regimen for co-trimoxazole (trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole) in eradication phase is 6/30&nbsp;mg/kg, up to maximum 240/1200&nbsp;mg in children, 240/1200&nbsp;mg in adults weighing 40 to 60&nbsp;kg, and 320/1600&nbsp;mg in adults weighing more than 60&nbsp;kg, taken orally every 12 hours. In children, co-trimoxazole is taken together with [[folic acid]] (0.1&nbsp;mg/kg up to 5&nbsp;mg in children). There are also cases where melioidosis is successfully treated with co-trimoxazole for 3 months without going through intensive therapy provided that there is only skin manifestations without involvement of internal organs or sepsis.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Resistance to cotrimoxazole is rare in Australia.<ref name=\"Yi 2014\"/>\n\n===Surgery===\nSurgical drainage is indicated for single, large abscesses in the liver, muscle, and prostate. However, for multiple abscesses in the liver, spleen, and kidney, surgical drainage may not be possible or necessary. For septic arthritis, [[arthrotomy]] washout and drainage is required. Surgical [[debridement]] may be necessary. For those with [[mycotic aneurysm]], urgent surgery is required for prosthetic vascular grafts. Life-long therapy with co-trimoxazole may be needed for those with prosthetic vascular grafts. Other abscesses rarely need to be drained because the majority of them can resolve with antibiotic treatment.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> In Australia, prostate abscess may require routine imaging and drainage.<ref name=\"Allen C 2005\"/>\n\n===Others===\nImmunomodulating therapies such as [[granulocyte colony-stimulating factor]], [[Interleukin 7]], and anti-PDI ([[programmed cell death]]) could be useful in melioidosis treatment especially for those with septic shock. This is because these drugs could help to boost the human body immune function against the bacteria.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\n==Prognosis==\nIn well-resourced settings, where the disease can be detected and treated early, the risk of death is 10%. In resource-poor settings, the risk of death from the disease is more than 40%.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/>\n\nFor those with incomplete treatment, reppearance of symptoms after a period of disease [[cure|remission]] (\"[[recrudescence]]\") can occur. Then, hospital admission is needed for intravenous antibiotics. For those who have completed treatment successfully, recurrence can also occur due to recrudescence or new melioidosis infection. With better therapies, the recrudescence rate has reduced from 10% to 5%. New infection is now more common than recrudescence.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/> Risk factors of recrudescence include severity of disease (patients with positive blood cultures or multifocal disease have a higher risk of relapse), choice of antibiotic for eradication therapy (doxycycline monotherapy and fluoroquinolone therapy are not as effective), poor compliance with eradication therapy and duration of eradication therapy less than 8 weeks.<ref name=\"Joost 2018\"/><ref name=\"Direk2006\"/><ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Chaowagul W, Suputtamongkol Y, Dance DA, Rajchanuvong A, Pattara-arechachai J, White NJ | year=1993 | title=Relapse in melioidosis: incidence and risk factors | journal=Journal of Infectious Diseases | volume=168 | pages=1181&ndash;1185 | pmid=8228352 | issue=5 | doi=10.1093/infdis/168.5.1181}}</ref>\n\nUnderlying medical conditions such as diabetes mellitus, chronic kidney disease, and cancer can worsen the long-term survival and disability of those who recover from infection.

{"title_page": "Piano Variations (Copland)", "text_new": "{{No footnotes|date=April 2017}}\nThe '''Piano Variations''' of [[United States|American]] [[composer]] [[Aaron Copland]] were written for [[piano solo]] from January to October 1930. They were dedicated to American writer and literary critic [[Gerald Sykes]] (c. 1904\u20131984) {{harv|Anon.|1984}}, and were originally published in 1932 by Cos Cob Press, which merged with Arrow Music Press in 1938 and was taken over by [[Boosey & Hawkes]] in 1956. The approximate performance time is 11 minutes.\n\n==Background==\nThe Piano Variations were a product of Copland's second-style period, also called the abstract period, which comprised only instrumental (non-vocal) compositions. During this time, the composer moved away from the jazzy idioms he experimented with in the 1920s and started working more in the direction of [[absolute music]]. The influence of composition pedagogue [[Nadia Boulanger]], with whom Copland studied in Paris at [[the Fontainebleau School of Music]] for Americans, is prevalent in the formal style, logic, patterns, and attention to detail in the Piano Variations and other works in this period.\n\nCopland stated that he worked on the [[variation (music)|variations]] individually without an agenda for fitting them together or sequencing them, which seems to contradict the piece's highly ordered construction and seemingly inevitable development. Copland acknowledged this contradiction but maintained that, in fact, \"One fine day when the time was right, the order of the variations fell into place\" {{harv|Butterworth|1985|loc=203}}. Copland had ambitious plans for this \"serious piano piece\"\u2014the first of three including the Piano Variations (1930), the Piano Sonata (1939\u201341), and the Piano Fantasy (1957); he worked painstakingly and thought at epic proportions, saying he \"should like to call them like [[Bach]] did the ''[[Goldberg Variations]]''\u2014but thus far haven't been able to think up a good one\" {{harv|Perlis|2002|loc=62}}.\n\n==Transcription as Orchestral Variations (1957)==\n\nCopland transcribed the Piano Variations for orchestra in 1957 after a commission from the [[Louisville Orchestra]]. These Orchestral Variations were premiered the following year under conductor [[Robert Whitney (conductor)|Robert Whitney]]. Copland regarded the \"lean, percussive and rather harmonically severe\" quality of the piano {{harv|Johnson|2005}} as essential to the Piano Variations in 1930, but after 27 years, reinvented the work to take advantage of a full orchestral palette. The Orchestral Variations offer a new perspective on the work, focusing instead on the contrasts of its multifarious moods and colors.\n\nThe Orchestral Variations are scored for the following instrumentation.\n\n{{col-begin}}\n{{col-break}}\n;[[Woodwind]]s:\n:2 [[Western concert flute|flute]]s (both doubling [[piccolo]])\n:[[Oboe]]\n:[[English horn]]\n:2 B-flat [[clarinet]]s (2nd doubling [[bass clarinet]])\n:2 [[bassoon]]s\n;[[Brass instrument|Brass]]:\n:4 [[French horn|horn]]s in F\n:2 [[trumpet]]s in B-flat\n:3 [[trombone]]s\n:[[Tuba]]\n\n;[[Harp]]\n;[[String section|Strings]]\n{{col-break}}\n;[[Percussion]]:\n:[[Timpani]]\n\n:2 Percussionists playing:\n::[[Snare drum]]\n::[[Tenor drum]]\n::[[Bass drum]]\n::[[Bongo drums]]\n::[[Conga drum]]\n::[[Cymbal]]s\n::[[Tam-tam]]\n::[[Woodblock (instrument)|Wood block]]\n::[[Glockenspiel]]\n::[[Xylophone]]\n::[[Tubular bell]]s\n::[[Antique cymbal]]s\n::[[Cow bell]]\n{{col-end}}\n\n==Reception==\nCopland regarded pianist [[Walter Gieseking]] very highly for his refined tone and subtle coloration, especially in the performance of [[Debussy]], and insisted that no one else could give a satisfactory premiere of his masterpiece. Unfortunately, Gieseking (who had performed in the premiere of the piano trio ''Vitebsk'' in New York in 1929) turned down Copland's request for a premiere due to the piece's \"crude dissonances\" and \"severity of style\" {{harv|Pollack|1999|loc=151, 561}}. Copland thus premiered the piece himself at a [[League of Composers]] Concert in New York on January 4, 1931.\n\nThe Piano Variations were praised in some esoteric circles, but the public was generally courteous but lukewarm in its reception. The work was variously described as new, strange, dissonant, stark, bare, and disconcerting. Critic [[Paul Rosenfeld]] contemplated its \"flinty, metallic sonorities.\"{{Cite quote|date=October 2011}} American composer [[Marc Blitzstein]] called it \"Lithic.\"{{Cite quote|date=October 2011}} The cold, hard tone of Copland's playing at the premiere, far from that of a concert pianist, lent a sharper edge to an already austere work. [[Leonard Bernstein]] later reported that he adored the piece, which was \"hard as nails,\" and also used it at parties to \"empty the room, guaranteed, in two minutes.\" It was to him a \"synonym for modern music\u2014so prophetic, harsh and wonderful, and so full of modern feeling and thinking\" {{harv|Greenfield, March, and Layton|1996|loc=103}}.\n\nDespite the wide spectrum of opinion, the Piano Variations were immediately recognized for their originality and made a lasting impression. The New York ''Herald Tribune'' reported that, in the piece, Copland \"sardonically thumbed his nose at all those esthetic attributes which have hitherto been considered essential to the creation of music\" {{harv|Sales and Steinberg|2001|loc=47}}. The work is now regarded{{by whom|date=October 2011}} as one of the most significant in contemporary piano literature.\n\nDancer-choreographer [[Martha Graham]] requested permission to choreograph a solo piece on the Piano Variations. With Copland's consent, she produced ''Dithyrambic'', an evocation of [[Dionysus]] that was received with the highest enthusiasm {{harv|Pollack|1999|loc=154}}. Copland admitted to being \"utterly astonished that anyone could consider this kind of music suitable for dance&nbsp;... although her choreography was considered as complex and abstruse as my music\" {{harv|Soares|1992|loc=104}}.\n\n==The Variations==\n\n===Overview===\nUnlike a traditional theme and variations, Copland's Piano Variations are not episodic {{harv|Rapp|1949|loc=81}}. They are continuously played through, in an undisrupted development of the seven-note \"row\" in the theme from which Copland builds the rest of the piece, \"in what I hope is a consistently logical way\" {{harv|Copland|2004|loc=354}}. All of the content can be traced back to this or transpositions of this seven-note [[motif (music)|motif]], suggesting the [[serialism|serialist]] techniques of [[Schoenberg]]. The concision, rigor, and lack of ornamentation have been compared to that of the style of [[Anton Webern]] {{harv|Oja|2000|loc=246}}. The [[Consonance and dissonance|dissonances]] (ubiquitous minor seconds, major sevenths and ninths) are precisely chosen for their degree of \"shock value\". While working on the Piano Variations, Copland cultivated a tautness and clarity of form and texture that became a precursor to the style of his other works.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}\n\nCopland also experimented with the potential of the physical instrument, as he did with [[microtones]] on the stringed instruments in ''[[Vitebsk (Copland)|Vitebsk]]''. In the Piano Variations, some notes are held down silently while pitches selected from their [[overtone series]] are struck, which produces an effect of ringing resonances without hammering the tones directly.\n\nAnother prominent characteristic is the piece's rhythmic irregularity. The meters change constantly within an essentially 4/4 framework.\n\n==References==\n* {{wikicite|ref={{harvid|Anon.|1984}}|reference=Anon. 1984. \"[https://www.nytimes.com/1984/07/16/obituaries/gerald-sykes-80-dies-was-author-and-critic.html Gerald Sykes, 80, Dies; Was Author and Critic]\".

However, some other villages have already discontinued the lottery, and rumors are spreading that a village farther north is considering doing likewise.\n\nThe lottery preparations start the night before, with coal merchant Mr. Summers and postmaster Mr. Graves drawing up a list of all the extended families in town and preparing a set of paper slips, one per family; all are blank, except for one later revealed to be marked with a [[Black Spot (Treasure Island)|black dot]]. The slips are folded and placed in a black wooden box, which in turn is stored in a safe at Mr. Summers' office until the lottery is scheduled to begin. Over the years, the box has become battered and discolored and has been stored in various places around town when not in use. \n\nOn the morning of the lottery, the townspeople gather shortly before 10&nbsp;a.m. in order to have everything done in time for lunch. First, the heads of the extended families each draw one slip from the box, but wait to unfold them until all the slips have been drawn. Bill Hutchinson gets the marked slip, meaning that his family has been chosen. His wife Tessie protests that Mr. Summers rushed him through the drawing, but the other townspeople dismiss her complaint. Since the Hutchinson family consists of only one household, a second drawing to choose one household within the family is skipped.\n\nFor the final drawing, one slip is placed in the box for each member of the household{{snd}} Bill, Tessie, and their three children. Each of the five draws a slip, and Tessie gets the marked one. The townspeople stone her, as she screams about the unfairness of the lottery, and the slips blow away in the wind.\n\n==Themes==\nOne of the major ideas of \"The Lottery\" is that of a [[scapegoat]]. The act of [[stoning]] someone to death yearly purges the town of the bad and allows for the good. This is hinted in the references to agriculture.\n\nThe story also speaks of mob psychology and the idea that people can [[irrationality|abandon reason]] and act cruelly if they are part of a [[Crowd psychology|large group of people behaving in the same manner]].

During the peak of the lottery fever in Springfield, news anchor Kent Brockman announces on television that people hoping to get tips on how to win the jackpot have borrowed every available copy of [[Shirley Jackson]]'s book ''The Lottery'' at the local library. One of them is [[Homer Simpson|Homer]], who throws the book into the fireplace after Brockman reveals that \"Of course, the book does not contain any hints on how to win the lottery. It is, rather, a chilling tale of conformity gone mad.\"<ref name=\"Murphy\">{{cite book |last1=Murphy |first1=Bernice M. |title=Shirley Jackson: Essays on the Literary Legacy |date=2005 |publisher=[[McFarland & Company]]|location=Jefferson|isbn=9780786423125|page=1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sZIjIB0JA4MC&pg=PA1&dq=%22Dog+of+Death%22++simpsons#v=onepage&q=%22Dog%20of%20Death%22%20%20simpsons&f=false |accessdate=23 August 2017 |chapter=Introduction: 'Do You Know Who I Am?', Reconsidering Shirley Jackson}}</ref> In her book ''Shirley Jackson: Essays on the Literary Legacy'', Bernice Murphy comments that this scene displays some of the most contradictory things about Jackson: \"It says a lot about the visibility of Jackson's most notorious tale that more than 50 years after its initial creation it is still famous enough to warrant a mention in the world's most famous sitcom. The fact that Springfield's citizenry also miss the point of Jackson's story completely ... can perhaps be seen as an indication of a more general misrepresentation of Jackson and her work.\"<ref name=\"Murphy\"/><br><br>\n\nIn \"Arbitrary Condemnation and Sanctioned Violence in Shirley Jackson's 'The Lottery'\" (December 2004), Patrick J. Shields suggests there is a connection between the death penalty and \"The Lottery\" when writing:\n{{quote|Though these ritual executions seem to have the support of the entire community and have been carried out for as long as everyone can seem to remember, a doubt seems to linger. Mrs. Adams tells us, \"Some places have already quit the lotteries\" (S. Jackson, 1999, p.77). On another level, we as readers feel quite uncomfortable observing such blind obedience to tradition among the villagers. And further, we as readers may be likely to make a connection as we witness modern day executions and realize that there is arbitrariness in these instances as well... It is hard for some to imagine abolition of [[capital punishment]] in our culture. They equate abolition with undermining law and morality. But it is precisely law and morality that are being undermined by the arbitrary condemnation of capital punishment.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Shields |first1=Patrick J. |title=Arbitrary Condemnation and Sanctioned Violence in Shirley Jackson's \"The Lottery\" |journal=Contemporary Justice Review |date=December 2004 |volume=7 |issue=4 |pages=411-419}}</ref> }}\n\n==Dramatizations==\n{{More citations needed|section|date=August 2017}}\nIn addition to numerous reprints in magazines, anthologies and textbooks, \"The Lottery\" has been adapted for radio, live television, a 1953 ballet, films in 1969 and 1997, a TV movie, an opera, and a one-act play by Thomas Martin.\n\n===1951 radio version===\nA radio adaptation by [[NBC]] was broadcast March 14, 1951, as an episode of the anthology series ''[[NBC Presents: Short Story]]''.

Stears studied at Harrow College of Art and Southall Technical School before working as a draughtsman with the Air Ministry.\n\nHe served as a dispatch rider during his [[National Service]], then joined a firm of architects where he was able to utilise his passion for model-making by constructing scale models of building projects for clients.<ref name=\"Obituary\">[https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/obituary-john-stears-1107368.html \"Obituary: John Stears\"].
