By combining both these mediums, Gabellone created the basis for his synthesis of the [[Surrealism|surreal]], the [[Contemporary art|contemporary]] and the [[baroque]]<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Surreal and the Natural, Giuseppe Gabellone|last=Bonami|first=Francesco|publisher=Edizioni Charta, Milan, and Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago|year=2002|isbn=|location=|pages=13}}</ref>.\n\nThe work of Giuseppe Gabellone is characterized by strict formal research and constant experimentation with different mediums and their idioms and materials, resulting in an analytic reflection on the use of space. Since the beginning of the 2000\u2019s, he has been investigating different types of wall sculpture, reinterpreting traditional Italian low relief. The work investigates the dialectics between two and three dimensions, and between representation and ornament<ref>{{Cite book|title=Sanguine, Luc Tuymans on Baroque|last=Tuymans|first=Luc|publisher=Fondazione Prada|year=2018|isbn=|location=Milano|pages=}}</ref>. \n\nGabellone\u2019s work is irregular in its appearance and of unknown origin<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Surreal and the Natural, Giuseppe Gabellone|last=Bonami|first=Francesco|publisher=Edizioni Charta, Milan, and Museum of Contemporary Art, Chicago|year=2002|isbn=|location=|pages=11}}</ref>, reinforcing the particularity of his production.

He was known especially for his war poetry, but also wrote novels, short stories and children's fiction (including the Hartwarp books). Pudney also wrote broad-ranging non-fiction, often commissioned, which served as his primary source of income. \n\n==Education and Early Career==\nJohn Pudney was born at [[Langley, Berkshire|Langley Marish]], the only son of Henry William Pudney (a farmer and countryman) and Mabel Sleigh Pudney. He was educated at [[Gresham's School]], [[Holt, Norfolk|Holt]], where he encountered [[W. H. Auden]], [[Benjamin Britten]], and [[Humphrey Spender]]. He left school in 1925 at the age of sixteen, and spent several years working as an estate agent and studying to become a surveyor. However, he began contributing articles to the [[News Chronicle|News Chronicle]] at the same time, also writing short stories and channelling his love of the countryside into verse. <ref name=dnb>[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/31573Roger Lubbock, \u2018Pudney, John Sleigh (1909\u20131977)\u2019, rev. Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, May 2006]</ref> At this time he was one of a group of young writers (including [[Dylan Thomas]], [[George Barker (poet)|George Barker]] and [[David Gascoyne]]) who gathered about the well-known bookshop at No 4, Parton Street, near London's [[Red Lion Square]], run by David Archer.<ref>[https://www.penpushermagazine.co.uk/magazine/issues/article/215/ Goodall, Anna. 'Parton Street Bookshop' in ''Pen Pusher'']</ref> Pudney also wrote for [[The Listener]], and as a producer at the BBC, where he produced the radio play ''Hadrian's Wall'' with text by Auden and music by Britten, which was broadcast from Newcastle on 25 November 1937.<ref>[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=IMFZ8a8aNHUC&pg=PT116&lpg=PT116&dq=John+Pudney+Benjamin+Britten&source=bl&ots=MUhRGApbmp&sig=ACfU3U2b1caNszL8RMuBi3jjBlRlW4z0Lw&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwi8-c67k8zoAhUJesAKHRsaDzIQ6AEwCXoECAsQOA#v=onepage&q=John%20Pudney%20Benjamin%20Britten&f=false Warden, C.

''London Writing of the 1930s'' (2018) p 88](</ref>\n\n==War Poetry==\nHis first collection of verse, ''Spring Encounter'', was published in 1933 by [[Methuen Publishing|Methuen]], gaining the attention of [[Lady Ottoline Morrell]], who became a supporter. During the 1930s he moved on from journalism and poetry to publishing novels and collections of short stories.

The complete rules are published as the [http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/official_info/official_rules/foreword.jsp Official Baseball Rules at MLB.com], the official web site of [[Major League Baseball]] in the United States and Canada. The rules are also published in book form in North America by the ''[[Sporting News]]''. Many amateur and youth leagues use the \"OBR\" with only a few modifications for safety.\n\nOther slightly modified versions of the \"Official Baseball Rules\" are used in competitions operated by the [[International Baseball Federation]] (IBAF), including the [[Baseball at the Summer Olympics|Olympics]] and the [[Baseball World Cup|World Cup]], most leagues outside North America (such as Japan's [[Nippon Professional Baseball]]), and youth baseball organizations such as [[Little League]], [[PONY League]], and [[Cal Ripken, Sr. Collegiate Baseball League|Cal Ripken League]].\n\nThe baseball rulebook of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA), aside from governing the games of that organization's members, is also used by several other competitions involving college-aged players.\n\nU.S. high school and high school-age baseball is governed by the rules of the [[National Federation of State High School Associations]] (NFHS).\n\n==Differences and evolution==\n\nFor the origins of the game, see [[rounders]], a game originating in England and Ireland. Unlike many other sports, the Official Baseball Rules have remained mainly static during the modern era of the game.  Many baseball players, fans, and administrators view the rules and traditions of professional baseball as time-tested and nearly sacrosanct.\n\nThis was not the case during baseball's early days, particularly in the late 19th century, when rules changed almost yearly, often significantly.  The game as we know it today really only began to take shape in the late 1880s, and even after that, many significant rule changes were made during the rest of that century.\n\nIn 1857, under the [[Knickerbocker Rules]] which governed until 1872, the current 9-inning format was adopted, replacing the previous rule that the first team to score 21 runs won.  The next year called strikes were recognized, and a batter was out if a ball, fair or foul, was caught on the fly or after one bounce. In 1867, the batter had the right to call for a high or low pitch, to be determined by the umpire.\n\nThe [[National League]] formed in 1876.  Its rules changed almost yearly for the next quarter century.  In 1880, a batter was out if the catcher caught the third strike; otherwise, the batter got four strikes.  Before 1883, pitchers were required to deliver pitches with their hand below their hips; in that year, the rule was changed to allow shoulder-high deliveries.  Until 1887, batters could call for either a high or low pitch, and the strike zone was either above or below the waist.  In 1885, the rules changed, until 1893, to allow bats to be flat on one side; beginning in 1893, they had to be round.  In 1887, the rules  changed so that batters could no longer call for a pitch; and the strike zone was defined as from the shoulders to the knees.  During this period, the pitcher's mound was much closer to home plate, foul balls were not counted as strikes, batters got four strikes, and the number of \"called balls\" resulting in a walk\u2014which initially included strikes and foul balls- went from 9 to 8 to 7 to 6 to 5 and, in 1889, to 4.  In that same year, the number of strikes went from 4 to 3.  In 1887, a rule was adopted for that year only counting walks as hits, which played havoc with statistics.  In 1892, the 154 game schedule was adopted.  In 1893, the pitcher's mound was moved from 50 to 60.5 feet from home plate.  In 1894, foul bunts were made strikes, and the [[infield fly rule]] was adopted with one out.  In 1895, foul tips were made strikes, but not foul balls.  In 1898, the first modern balk rule was adopted, as well as the modern rule for recognizing stolen bases.  In 1901, the infield fly rule was extended to apply when there were no outs.\n\nBecause of the frequent and often radical rule changes during this early period, the \"modern era\" is generally considered to have begun in 1901, when the [[American League]] was also formed.\n\nSome significant rule changes continued in the first quarter of the 20th century but were much less frequent.  In 1903, the American League adopted the foul strike rule.  In 1907, the sacrifice fly rule was adopted.  In 1910, cork centers were added to balls.  In 1925, the minimum distance for a home run was made 250 feet.\n\nAfter that, the rules remained virtually static for decades.  In 1961, the 162-game schedule was adopted.  In 1969, the pitcher's mound dropped five inches and the strike zone reduced:  from the armpits to the top of the knees.  In 1973, the American League adopted the [[designated hitter]] rule\u2014rejected to this day by the National League.  This was probably the most controversial rule change in baseball's history and is still subject to lively debate.  Also controversial when adopted was the later introduction of [[interleague play]].  The most recent significant rule changes, banning the use of steroids and other performance-enhancing substances, have had widespread support as protecting the integrity of the game.  The use of steroids by many players over the last two decades has called into question records for both hitting and pitching.\n\n==Gameplay==\n\n===General structure===\n[[Image:Baseball diamond.svg|thumb|right|Diagram of a [[baseball diamond]]]]\n\nBaseball is played between two teams with nine players in the field from the team that is not batting at that point (the batting team would have one batter in play at \"home plate\" on the field). On a [[baseball field]], the game is under the authority of several umpires. There are usually four umpires in major league games; up to six (and as few as one) may officiate depending on the league and the importance of the game. There are three ''[[base (baseball)|bases]]''. Numbered [[counterclockwise]], first, second, and third bases are cushions (sometimes informally referred to as ''bags'') shaped as 15&nbsp;in (38&nbsp;cm) squares which are raised a short distance above the ground; together with [[home plate]], the fourth \"base\", they form a square with sides of 90&nbsp;ft (27.4&nbsp;m) called the diamond.  Home plate is a pentagonal rubber slab 17&nbsp;in (43.2&nbsp;cm) wide. The playing field is divided into three main sections:\n*The infield, containing the four bases, is for general defensive purposes bounded by the foul lines and within the grass line (see figure).\n*The outfield is the grassed area beyond the infield grass line between the foul lines, and bounded by a wall or fence.\n*Foul territory is the entire area outside the foul lines.\n\n<!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:Pat-Burrell.jpg|thumb|[[Pat Burrell]] of the [[Philadelphia Phillies]] warms up in the '''On-deck circle''' as his teammate enters the '''batter's box''' (see diagram).]] -->\nThe pitcher's mound is located in the center of the infield. It is an 18&nbsp;ft (5.5&nbsp;m) diameter mound of dirt no higher than 10&nbsp;in (25.4&nbsp;cm). Near the center of the mound is the pitching rubber, a rubber slab positioned 60&nbsp;ft&nbsp;6&nbsp;in (18.4&nbsp;m) from home plate. The pitcher must have one foot on the rubber at the start of every pitch to a batter, but the pitcher may leave the mound area once the ball is released.\n\nAt the college/professional level, baseball is played in nine [[inning]]s in which each team gets one turn to [[#Batting|bat]] and tries to score ''[[run (baseball)|runs]]'' while the other pitches and defends in the field. High school baseball plays seven innings and [[Little League]] uses six-inning games. An inning is broken up into two halves in which the away team bats in the top (first) half, and the home team bats in the bottom (second) half. In baseball, the defense always has the ball\u2014a fact that differentiates it from most other team sports. The teams switch every time the defending team gets three players of the batting team ''[[out (baseball)|out]]''. The winner is the team with the most runs after nine innings. If the home team is ahead after the top of the ninth, play does not continue into the bottom half. When this happens, an X is put on the scoreboard for the home team's score in the ninth inning. In the case of a tie, additional innings are played until one team comes out ahead at the end of an inning. If the home team takes the lead anytime during the bottom of the ninth or of any inning after that, play stops and the home team is declared the winner. This is known as a walk-off.\n\n[[Image:Baseball swing.jpg|thumb|left|A batter follows through after swinging at a pitched ball.]]\nThe basic contest is always between the ''[[pitcher]]'' for the fielding team and a ''[[Batter (baseball)|batter]]''. The pitcher throws\u2014''[[pitch (baseball)|pitches]]''\u2014the ball towards home plate, where the ''[[catcher]]'' for the fielding team waits (in a crouched stance) to receive it. Behind the catcher stands the home plate umpire. The batter stands in one of the [[batter's box]]es and tries to hit the ball with a bat. The pitcher must keep one foot in contact with the top or front of the pitcher's rubber\u2014a 24\u00d76&nbsp;in (61\u00d715&nbsp;cm) plate located atop the pitcher's mound\u2014during the entire pitch, so he can only take one step backward and one forward in delivering the ball. The catcher's job is to receive any pitches that the batter does not hit and to \"call\" the game by a series of hand movements that signal to the pitcher what pitch to throw and where. The catcher also usually signals the desired location of the ball within the strike zone and \"sets up\" behind the plate or holds his glove up in the desired location as a target.  The catcher's role becomes more crucial depending on how the game is going, and how the pitcher responds to a given situation. Each pitch begins a new ''play'', which might consist of nothing more than the pitch itself.\n\nEach half-inning, the goal of the defending team is to get three members of the other team out. A player who is out must leave the field and wait for his next turn [[at bat]]. There are many ways to get batters and baserunners out; some of the most common are catching a batted ball [[in flight|in the air]], [[tag out]]s, [[force play|force outs]], and [[strikeout]]s. After the fielding team has put out three players from the opposing team, that half of the inning is over and the team in the field and the team at bat switch places; there is no upper limit to the number that may bat in rotation before three outs are recorded. Going through the entire order in an inning is referred to as \"batting around\" and it is indicative of a high-scoring inning. A complete inning consists of each opposing side having a turn (three outs) on offense.\n\nThe goal of the team at bat is to score more runs than the opposition; a player may do so by batting, then [[baserunning|becoming a baserunner]], touching all the bases in order (via one or more plays), and finally touching home plate. A player may also become a baserunner by being inserted as a [[Pinch runner|pinch-runner]]. To that end, the goal of each batter is to enable [[#Baserunning|baserunners]] to score or to become a baserunner himself. The batter attempts to hit the ball into [[fair territory]]\u2014between the baselines\u2014in such a way that the defending players cannot get them or the baserunners out. In general, the pitcher attempts to prevent this by pitching the ball in such a way that the batter cannot hit it cleanly or, ideally, at all.\n\nA baserunner who has successfully touched home plate without being retired (called out) after touching all previous bases  scores a ''[[run (baseball statistics)|run]]''. In an enclosed field, a [[fair ball]] hit over the fence on the fly is an automatic ''[[home run]]'', which entitles the batter and all runners to touch all the bases and score. On a field with foul poles, a ball that hits a pole is also a home run. A home run hit with all bases occupied ('[[bases loaded]]') is called a ''grand slam''.\n\n===Fielding team===<!-- This section is linked from [[Terry Puhl]] -->\n{{see also|Baseball positions|Baseball positioning}}\n\nThe squad in the field is the defensive team; they attempt to prevent the baserunners from scoring. There are nine defensive positions, but only two have a mandatory location (pitcher and catcher). The locations of the other seven fielders are not specified by the rules, except that at the moment the pitch is delivered, they must be positioned in fair territory and not in the space between the pitcher and the catcher. These fielders often shift their [[baseball positioning|positioning]] in response to specific batters or game situations, and they may exchange positions with one another at any time.\n\nThe nine positions most commonly used (with the number scorekeepers use) are: pitcher (1), catcher (2), first baseman (3), second baseman (4), third baseman (5), shortstop (6), left fielder (7), center fielder (8), and right fielder (9). Note that, in rare cases, teams may use dramatically differing schemes, such as switching an outfielder for an infielder. The numbering convention was established by [[Henry Chadwick (baseball writer)|Henry Chadwick]]. The reason the shortstop seems out of order has to do with the way fielders positioned themselves in the early years of the game. Each position is weighted on the [[defensive spectrum]] in terms of difficulty. The most difficult position is the catcher, while the least difficult is first base. Designated hitter, while on the scale, is not part of the defense at all. Pitchers, while part of the active defense, are so specialized in their role that they usually make only routine plays.\n\n====The battery====\nThe ''[[battery (baseball)|battery]]'' is composed of the ''[[pitcher]]'', who stands on the rubber of the mound, which is also known as the pitching plate, and the ''[[catcher]]'', who squats behind home plate. These are the two fielders who always deal directly with the batter on every pitch, hence the term \"battery\", coined by [[Henry Chadwick (baseball writer)|Henry Chadwick]] and later reinforced by the implied comparison to [[artillery]] fire.\n\nThe pitcher's main role is to [[pitch (baseball)|pitch]] the ball toward home plate with the goal of getting the batter [[out (baseball)|out]]. Pitchers also play defense by fielding batted balls, [[Covering a base|covering bases]] (for a potential [[tag out]] or [[force play|force out]] on an approaching runner), or backing up throws. The catcher's main role is to receive the pitch if the batter does not hit it. Together with the pitcher and coaches, the catcher plots game strategy by suggesting different pitches and by shifting the starting positions of the other fielders. Catchers are also responsible for defense in the area near home plate (such as [[Uncaught third strike|dropped third strikes]] and [[wild pitch]]es) or baserunning plays, most commonly when an opposing player attempts to [[Stolen base|steal a base]]. Due to the exceptional difficulty of the position, catchers are universally valued for their defensive prowess as opposed to their ability to hit.\n\n====The infielders====\nThe four infielders are the ''[[first baseman]]'', ''[[second baseman]]'', ''[[shortstop]]'', and ''[[third baseman]]''. Originally the first, second and third basemen played very near their respective bases, and the shortstop generally played \"in\" (hence the term), covering the area between second, third, and the pitchers box, or wherever the game situation required. As the game evolved, the fielding positions changed to the now-familiar \"umbrella\", with the first and third baseman generally positioned a short distance toward second base from their bases, the second baseman to the right side of second base standing farther away from the base than any other infielder, and the shortstop playing to the left of second base, as seen from the batter's perspective.\n\nThe [[first baseman]]'s job consists largely of making plays at first base on [[ground ball]]s hit to the other [[infielder]]s. When an infielder picks up a ball from the ground hit by the [[Batter (baseball)|batter]], he must throw it to the first baseman who must catch the ball and maintain contact with the base before the batter gets to it for the batter to be out. The need to do this quickly often requires the first baseman to stretch one of his legs to touch first base while catching the ball simultaneously. The first baseman must be able to catch the ball very well and usually wears a specially designed [[Baseball glove|mitt]]. The first baseman fields balls hit near first base. The first baseman also has to receive throws from the pitcher in order to tag runners out who have reached base safely. The position is less physically challenging than the other positions, but there is still a lot of skill involved. Infielders don't always make good throws to first base, so it is the first baseman's job to field any ball thrown toward him cleanly. Older players who can no longer fulfill the demands of their original positions also often become first basemen.\n\nThe second baseman covers the area to the first-base side of second base and provides backup for the first baseman in [[bunt (baseball)|bunt]] situations. He also is a cut-off for the [[outfield]]. The cut-off provides an intermediary between an outfielder and the infield so that the outfielder does not have to throw the entire distance if they've been forced to field the ball near the outer edge of the outfield. The shortstop fills the critical gap between second and third bases\u2014where right-handed batters generally hit ground balls\u2014and also covers second or third base and the near part of [[left field]]. This player is also a cut-off for the outfield. This position is the most demanding defensively, so a good shortstop doesn't need to necessarily be a good batter, though this has changed in modern times. The third baseman's primary requirement is a strong throwing arm, in order to make the long throw across the infield to the first baseman. Quick [[reaction time]] is also important for third basemen, as they tend to see more sharply-hit balls than do the other infielders, thus the nickname for third base as the \"hot corner\".  Also, because there are far more right-handed hitters than lefties, there are more ground balls hit to the left side of the infield due to the natural motion of the batter's swing.\n\n====The outfielders====\nThe three outfielders, ''[[left fielder]]'', ''[[center fielder]]'', and ''[[right fielder]]'', are so named from the [[catcher]]'s perspective looking out onto the field. The [[right fielder]] generally has the strongest arm of all the [[outfielder]]s due to the need to make throws on runners attempting to take [[Third baseman|third base]]. The [[center fielder]] has more territory to cover than the corner [[outfielder]]s, so this player must be quick and agile with a strong arm to throw balls into the [[Infielder|infield]]; as with the [[shortstop]], teams tend to emphasize defense at this position. Also, the [[center fielder]] is considered the [[outfield]] leader, and left- and right-fielders often cede to his direction when fielding [[Batted ball|fly ball]]s. Of all outfielders, the ''[[left fielder]]'' often has the weakest arm, as they generally do not need to throw the ball as far in order to prevent the advance of any baserunners. The left fielder still requires good fielding and catching skills, and tends to receive more balls than the right fielder due to the fact that right-handed hitters, who are much more common, tend to \"pull\" the ball into left field. Each outfielder runs to \"back up\" a nearby outfielder who attempts to field a ball hit near both their positions. Outfielders also run to back up infielders on batted balls and thrown balls, including pick-off attempts from the [[pitcher]] or from the [[catcher]].\n\n====Defensive strategy====\n\n=====Pitching=====\n[[Image:baseball pitching motion 2004.jpg|thumb|left|The typical motion of a right-handed pitcher]]\n{{main|Pitcher}}\n\nEffective pitching is critical to a baseball team, as pitching is the key for the defensive team to retire batters and to prevent runners from getting on base. A full game usually involves over one hundred pitches thrown by each team. However, most pitchers begin to tire before they reach this point. In previous eras, pitchers would often throw up to four complete games (all nine innings) in a week. With new advances in medical research and thus a better understanding of how the human body functions and tires out, starting pitchers tend more often to throw fractions of a game (typically six or seven innings, depending on their performance) about every five days (though a few complete games do still occur each year).\n\nA single game often requires multiple pitchers, including the [[starting pitcher]] and [[relief pitcher]](s). Pitchers are substituted for one another like any other player (see above), and the rules do not limit the number of pitchers that can be used in a game; the only limiting factor is the size of the squad, naturally. In general, starting pitchers are not used in relief situations except sometimes during the post-season when every game is vital. If a game runs into many extra innings, a team may well empty its [[bullpen]]. If it then becomes necessary to use a \"position player\" as a pitcher, major league teams generally have certain players designated as emergency relief pitchers, to avoid the embarrassment of using a less skillful player. In baseball's early years, squads were smaller, and relief pitchers were relatively uncommon, with the starter normally remaining for the entire game unless he was either thoroughly ineffective or became injured; today, with a much greater emphasis on pitch count, over the course of a single game each team will frequently use from two to five pitchers. In the [[2005 American League Championship Series|2005]] [[American League Championship Series|ALCS]], all four of the [[Chicago White Sox]] victories were complete games by the starters, a highly noteworthy event in the modern game.\n\nWhile delivering the ball, the pitcher has a great arsenal at his disposal in the variation of location, velocity, movement, and arm location (see [[list of baseball pitches|types of pitches]]). Most pitchers attempt to master two or three types of pitches; some pitchers throw up to 6 types of pitches with varying degrees of control. Common pitches include a [[fastball]], which is the ball thrown at high speed; a [[curveball]], which is made to curve by rotation imparted by the pitcher; a [[change-up]], which seeks to mimic the delivery of a fastball but arrives at significantly lower velocity; a [[Split Finger Fastball#Split-finger fastball|splitfinger fastball]], which attempts to mimic the delivery of a fastball, but has slight topspin rotation allowing the baseball to sink as it approaches the batter due to the position of the index finger and middle finger being \"split\" on the baseball; a [[Slider (baseball)|slider]], which is made to curve laterally by rotation imparted by the pitcher; a [[knuckleball]], which is held either by the knuckles closest to the nails or by the nails themselves allowing the pitcher to throw a baseball with little or no spin on the ball allowing the baseball to move in any direction; a [[Vulcan changeup]], which seeks to mimic the delivery of a fastball but arrives at a significant lower velocity due to the pitcher holding the baseball with the middle and ring fingers slightly apart; a [[circle changeup]], which is held in the palm of the hand with the index finger curled around the side of the baseball, allowing the pitcher to mimic the delivery of a fastball but arrives at a significantly lower velocity.\n\nTo illustrate pitching strategy, consider the \"fastball/change-up\" combination: The average major-league pitcher can throw a fastball around 90 miles per hour (145&nbsp;km/h), and a few pitchers have even exceeded {{convert|100|mph}} . The change-up is thrown somewhere between {{convert|75|to|85|mph}} . Since the batter's timing is critical to hitting a pitch, a batter swinging to hit what looks like a fastball, would be terribly fooled (swing and miss, hopefully) when the pitch turns out to be a much slower change-up.\n\nSome pitchers choose to throw using the '[[Submarine (baseball)|submarine style]],' a very efficient sidearm or near-underhand motion. Pitchers with a submarine delivery are often very difficult to hit because of the angle and movement of the ball once released. [[Walter Johnson]], who threw one of the fastest fastballs in the history of the game, threw sidearm (though not submarine) rather than a normal overhand. True underhanded pitching is permitted in Major League Baseball. However, it is difficult to generate enough velocity and movement with the underhand motion. Among modern Major League pitchers, [[Chad Bradford]] had the closest to an underhand delivery, with his knuckles sometimes scraping the ground. However, he is still usually considered a \"submarine\" pitcher.\n\n=====Fielding strategy=====\n[[Image:West Side Park 1906 World Series.JPG|thumb|left|[[1906 World Series]], infielders playing \"in\" for the expected bunt and the possible play at the plate with the [[bases loaded]], the same strategy 112 years ago as now.]]\n\nOnly the pitcher's and catcher's locations are fixed, and then only at the beginning of each pitch. Thus, the players on the field move around as needed to defend against scoring a run. Many variations of this are possible, as location depends upon the situation. Circumstances such as the number of outs, the count (balls and strikes) on the batter, the number and speed of runners, the ability of the fielders, the ability of the pitcher, the type of pitch thrown, the tendencies of the hitter, and the inning cause the fielders to move to more strategic locations on the field. Common defensive strategies include: playing for the bunt, trying to prevent a [[stolen base]], moving to a shallow position to throw out a runner at home, playing at \"[[double play]] depth\", and moving fielders to locations where hitters are most likely to hit the ball.\n{{clear}}\n\n===Batting team===\n\n====Batters and runners====\nThe ultimate goal of the team at bat is to score runs. To accomplish this task, the team at bat successively (in a predetermined order called a ''lineup'' or ''[[batting order (baseball)|batting order]]'') sends its nine players to the batter's box (adjacent to home plate) where they become batters. (Each team sets its batting lineup at the beginning of the game. Changes to the lineup are tightly limited by the rules of baseball and must be communicated to the umpires, who have the substitutions announced for the opposing team and fans. See [[#Substitutions|Substitutions]] below.)\n\nA batter's turn at the plate is called a ''[[plate appearance]]''. Batters can advance to first base safely in one of seven methods: a [[Hit (baseball)|base-hit]] (abbreviated 'H') or [[Base on balls|walk]] ('BB' for base-on-balls) are by far the most common; being [[Hit by pitch|hit-by-the-pitch]] ('HBP'), reaching by [[Error (baseball)|error]] ('E') or [[fielder's choice]] ('FC') are less common; and somewhat rarely a player may reach base by virtue of [[Interference (baseball)|interference]] ('I') or a [[passed ball]] ('PB') on a [[strike-out]], where the player is allowed to run and reach base safely if he can. When the batter hits a fair ball, he must run to first base, and may continue or stop at any base unless he is put out. A successful hit occurs when the batter reaches a base: reaching only first base is a ''single''; reaching second base, a ''double''; third base, a ''triple''; and a hit that allows the batter to touch all bases in order on the same play is a [[home run]]\u2014whether the ball is hit over the fence does not matter (if the ball is not hit over the fence and the batter touches all bases, it is usually referred to as an \"inside-the-park home run\"). Once a runner is held to a base, he may attempt to advance at any time, but is not required to do so unless the batter or another runner displaces him (called a force play). A batter always drops his bat when running the bases; otherwise, the bat would slow him down and could give rise to a call of interference if it were to contact the ball or a fielder. However, if a batter hits the ball, and the batter or the dropped bat touches the ball, it is considered a dead ball.\n\nDepending on the way the ball comes off the bat, the play has different names. A batted ball is called a fly ball if it is hit in the air in an upward arc, such that a fielder might be able to catch it before it hits the ground. A batted ball is called a ''[[ground ball]]'' if it hits the ground within the infield before it can be caught, often due to being hit in a downward trajectory. Several different names are used to describe fly balls, depending on their trajectory. A ball hit high in the air and seemingly almost straight up is called a \"pop-up\". A ball hit forcefully in a fast-moving and seemingly almost straight-line trajectory is called a ''[[line drive]]''. A \"shallow\" fly ball, hit with just enough force to possibly land between the infielders and the outfielders, is often call a \"blooper\". A \"deep\" fly ball is hit with enough force to approach and possibly clear the outfield fence.\n\nWhen a ball is hit outside the foul lines, it is a ''foul ball'', requiring the batter and all runners to return to their respective bases, whether it is caught or not. Additionally, if a ground ball or a bunted ball lands in foul territory and the ball rolls back into bounds before reaching either first or third bases without being touched by either a fielder or a runner, then said ball is considered fair.\n\nOnce the batter and any existing runners have all stopped at a base or been put out, the ball is returned to the pitcher, and the next batter comes to the plate. After the opposing team bats in its own order and three more outs are recorded, the first team's batting order will continue again from where it left off.\n\nWhen a runner reaches home plate, he scores a run and is no longer a base runner. He must leave the playing area until his spot in the order comes up again. A runner may only circle the bases once per plate appearance and thus can score no more than a single run.\nIn the American, Pacific, and both Cuban leagues, there is a tenth player, a designated hitter, who bats for the pitcher.\n\n====Batting====\n{{main|Batting (baseball)}}\nEach [[plate appearance]] consists of a series of pitches, in which the [[pitcher]] throws the ball towards home plate while a batter is standing in the [[batter's box]] (either right or left). With each pitch, the batter must decide whether to swing the bat at the ball in an attempt to hit it. The pitches arrive quickly, so the [[Reaction time|decision to swing]] must be made in less than a tenth of a second, based on whether the ball is hittable and in the ''[[strike zone]]'', a region defined by the area directly above home plate and between the hollow beneath the batter's knee and the midpoint between the top of the shoulders and the top of the uniform pants. In addition to swinging at the ball, a batter who wishes to put the ball in play may hold his bat over home plate and attempt to tap a pitch lightly; this is called a [[bunt (baseball)|bunt]]. Good bunting technique has been described as \"catching the ball with the bat.\"\n\nOn any pitch, if the batter swings at the ball and misses, he is charged with a ''[[strike (baseball statistics)|strike]]''. If the batter does not swing, the home plate [[umpire (baseball)|umpire]] judges whether the ball passed through the strike zone. If the ball, or any part of it, passed through the zone, it is ruled a strike; otherwise, it is called a ''[[ball (baseball statistics)|ball]]''. The number of balls and strikes thrown to the current batter is known as the [[count (baseball)|count]]; the count is always given balls first (except in Japan, where it is reversed), then strikes (such as 3\u20132 or \"three and two\", also known as a \"full count\", which would be 3 balls and 2 strikes).\n\nIf the batter swings and makes contact with the ball, but does not put it in play in fair territory\u2014a ''[[foul ball]]''\u2014he is charged with an additional strike, except when there are already two strikes. Thus, a foul ball with two strikes leaves the count unchanged. (However, a noted exception to this rule is that a ball bunted foul with two strikes is a strikeout.) If a pitch is batted foul or fair and a member of the defensive team is able to catch it, before the ball strikes the ground, the batter is declared out. In the event that a bat deflects the ball sharply and directly back toward the catcher's box, it is a ''[[foul tip]]''. If a ball ruled as a foul tip is caught, with two strikes in the count,  it is considered a counted third strike and an out; if not initially caught by the catcher, it remains a foul ball with two strikes.\n\nWhen three strikes occur on a batter, it is a ''[[strikeout]]'' and the batter is automatically out unless the pitch is not caught by the catcher or if the pitch bounces before it is caught. It is then ruled an [[uncaught third strike]], an exception to the third strike rule: If the catcher drops the third strike, the batter is permitted to attempt to advance to first base if there are two outs in the inning or if it is unoccupied. In this case, the batter is not out (although the pitcher is awarded a strikeout). The catcher can try to get the batter out by tagging him with the ball or throwing the ball to first base to put him out. (See [[Doug Eddings|Doug Eddings (2005 ALCS)]] and [[Mickey Owen|Mickey Owen (1941 World Series)]] for famous examples of dropped third strikes that dramatically altered the course of post-season series.)\n\nOn the fourth [[ball (baseball statistics)|ball]], it is called a walk, and the batter becomes a runner, and is entitled to advance to first base without risk of being put out, called a ''[[base on balls]]'' or a ''walk'' (abbreviated BB). If a pitch touches the batter (or the batter's clothes), the umpire declares a ''[[hit by pitch]]'' (abbreviated HBP) and the batter is awarded first base, unless the umpire determines that the ball was in the strike zone when it hit the batter, or that the batter did not attempt to avoid being hit.  In practice, neither exception is ever called unless the batter obviously tries to get hit by the pitch; even standing still in the box will virtually always be overlooked, and the batter awarded first.  In addition, if the batter swings at a pitch that hits him, it counts as a strike.  If the catcher's mitt, catcher's mask, or any part of the catcher comes in contact with the batter and/or the batter's bat as the batter is attempting to hit a pitch, the batter is awarded first base, ruled \"catcher's interference\".\n\n====Baserunning====\n{{main|Baserunning}}\nOnce a batter becomes a runner and reaches first base safely, he is said to be \"on\" that base until he attempts to advance to the next base, until he is put out, or until the half-inning ends. In order to be safe a runner must beat the ball to the bag. When two or more runners are on the basepaths, the runner farther along is called a ''lead runner'' or a ''preceding runner''; any other runner is called a ''trailing runner'' or a ''following runner''. Runners on second or third base are considered to be in ''scoring position'' since ordinary hits, even singles, will often allow them to score.\n\nA runner legally touching a base is \"[[Safe (baseball)|safe]]\"\u2014in most situations he may not be put out. Runners may attempt to advance from base to base at any time (except when the [[dead ball (baseball)|ball is dead]]).  A runner that must attempt to advance is [[force play|forced]] , when all previous bases are occupied and a batted ball that touches the ground is a fair ball. The runner forced to advance toward the next base is considered \"forced out\" if a fielder holding the baseball touches the intended base before the baserunner arrives. When a batted ball is hit in the air, i.e., a ''fly ball'', and caught by the defending team, runners must return and \"retouch\" the base they occupied at the [[time of pitch|time of the pitch]]. The common name for this requirement is ''[[tag up|tagging up]].'' If the runner retouches the origin base at any time after the fly ball is first touched by a fielder, he may attempt to advance to the next base or bases at his own risk. The penalty for failing to retouch (if the defensive team notices this) is that the advancing runner can be put out on a live appeal in which the defensive team player with the ball touches the base from which that runner departed prematurely. If a runner tagged up and tries to run to the next base in sequence, they are deemed out if tagged by an infielder at any point before reaching the base or the ball arrives at the base ahead of the runner. However, if the runner is not forced to run to the next base in sequence, they are not deemed out until they are tagged.  This often leads to a runner being trapped between two or more infielders trying to tag them before reaching any base: a situation known as being \"caught in no-man's-land\".\n\nOnly one runner may occupy a base at a time; if two runners are touching a base at once, the trailing runner is [[in jeopardy]] and will be out if [[tag out|tagged]]. However, if the trail runner reached the base having been forced there, it is the lead runner who will be out when tagged for failing to reach his [[force base]]. Either such occurrence is very rare. Thus, after a play, at most three runners may be on the basepaths, one on each base\u2014first, second, and third. When three runners are on base, this is called ''bases loaded''.\n\n[[Image:Baseball pick-off attempt.jpg|thumb|right|Pick-off attempt on runner (in red) at first base]]\n\nBaserunners may attempt to advance, or [[stolen base|steal a base]], while the pitcher is preparing to make a pitch, while he is making a pitch, or while waiting for a return throw from the catcher after a pitch. The pitcher, in lieu of delivering the pitch, may try to prevent this by throwing the ball to one of the infielders in order to tag the runner; if successful, it is called a ''pick-off''. He may also, as part of a planned sequence, throw a pitch well outside and high of the strike zone to his catcher who is waiting for it upright there, and is thus better prepared to throw out a runner trying to steal; this sequence is called a \"pitchout.\" If the runner attempts to steal the next base but is tagged out before reaching it safely, he is ''caught stealing''. An illegal attempt by the pitcher to deceive a runner, among other pitching violations, is called a [[balk]], allowing all runners to advance one base without risk of being put out.\n\nAnother fundamental tenet of the rules of baseball is that a runner who was initially ruled out can subsequently be ruled safe, but once a runner is ruled safe he cannot be called out on the same play, unless he overruns the base. For example, if a baserunner steals second base, beating the throw, an umpire might make the quick call of safe, but if the runner then slides beyond the base and is tagged before he can retreat to it the umpire has the right to change the call. A runner initially called out can be subsequently ruled safe if the fielder putting the runner out drops the ball (on either a tag or force play), pulls his foot off the base (in the case of a force play), or otherwise illegally [[Obstruction (baseball)|obstructs]] a runner from reaching a base that he otherwise would have reached safely.\n\n====Batting and base running strategy====\nThe goal of each batter is to become a base runner himself (by a [[hit (baseball)|base hit]], a [[base on balls]], being [[hit by pitch|hit by the pitch]], a [[error (baseball)|fielding error]], or [[fielder's choice]]) or to help move other base runners along (by another [[hit (baseball)|base hit]], a [[sacrifice bunt]], [[sacrifice fly]], or [[hit and run (baseball)|hit and run]]).\n\nBatters attempt to \"read\" pitchers through pre-game preparation by studying the tendencies of pitchers and by talking to other batters that previously faced the pitcher. While batting, batters attempt to \"read\" pitches by looking for clues that the pitcher or catcher reveal. These clues (also referred to as \"tipping pitches\") include movements of the pitcher's arms, shoulders, body, etc., or the positioning of the catcher's feet and glove. Batters can attempt to \"read\" the spin of a ball early in the pitch to anticipate its trajectory.\n\nBatters also remain keenly aware of the count during their at bat. The count is considered to be in the batter's favor when there are more balls than strikes (e.g., two balls and no strikes). This puts pressure on the pitcher to throw a strike to avoid a walk so the batter is more likely to get an easier pitch to hit and can look for a particular pitch in a particular zone or take a riskier or bigger swing. The count is considered to be in the pitcher's favor when there are fewer balls than strikes (e.g., no balls and two strikes). This gives the pitcher more freedom to try enticing the batter to swing at a pitch outside the strike zone or throwing a pitch that is harder to control (e.g. a [[curve ball|curve]], [[Slider (baseball)|slider]] or [[split-finger fastball|splitter]]), but that is also harder to hit. Thus the batter will take a more protective swing.\n\nA major strategy in batting at competitive levels of baseball is patient hitting. An example of patient hitting is when a batter has a zero strike count, the batter will almost always look for his perfect pitch. One strike hitting is very similar to no strike hitting and the batter usually is still looking for a good pitch to hit. Two strike hitting, the strategy is changed where the batter will protect the plate by fouling off pitches until the batter is able to find a pitch to hit. This style of hitting allows the hitter to look for a good pitch to hit, and makes the pitcher throw more pitches so that he will tire out faster. This is critical if the batting team is facing a very skilled pitcher who, if allowed to, will take over the game with his ability to get batters to do what he wants them to do.\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Baseball slide.jpg|thumb|right|A third base coach (left) signals from the [[coach's box]] for the runner to [[slide (baseball)|slide]] head first into 3rd base]] -->\nIn general, base running is a tactical part of the game requiring good judgment by runners (and their coaches) to assess the risk in attempting to advance. During [[tag out|tag]] plays, a good [[slide (baseball)|slide]] can affect the outcome of the play. Managers will sometimes simultaneously send a runner and require the batter to swing (a [[hit and run (baseball)|hit-and-run]] play) in an attempt to advance runners. On a hit-and-run play the batter will often try to hit to the opposite field (the opposite of the natural tendency for the right-handed hitter to pull the ball to left field and vice versa).  Hitting to the opposite field will likely find an opening in the infield vacated by the fielder covering second base.  This is because coverage of second base against a steal is best achieved by whichever fielder is closer to second base, the shortstop or the second baseman; and such positioning is aimed at defending against the natural tendency of the hitter.\n\nTypically, the first and second batters are [[contact hitter]]s, who try to make contact with the ball to put it in play, and then run fast to reach base. The third batter is generally the best all-around hitter on the team, who tries to help baserunners to score runs, and if possible to reach base himself. The fourth batter is the [[cleanup hitter]], and is often a [[power hitter]], who tries to hit home runs.\n\nThe fifth and sixth batters often help baserunners to score runs. They often \"sacrifice\" his [[at-bat]]. This can be done by [[sacrifice bunt|bunting]] the ball, hitting a [[sacrifice fly|fly ball]] far enough in the air that a baserunner can advance after the catch, or simply making contact with the ball on a hit-and-run play.\n\nDuring the course of play many offensive and defensive players run close to each other, and during tag plays, the defensive player must touch the offensive player. Although baseball is considered a non-contact sport, a runner may be allowed to make potentially dangerous contact with a fielder as part of an attempt to reach base, unless that fielder is fielding a batted ball. (Noted exceptions to the dangerous contact rule are found throughout amateur competitions, including youth leagues, high school, and college baseball.) A good slide is often more advantageous than such contact, and \"malicious\" contact by runners is typically prohibited as offensive [[interference (baseball)|interference]]. The most common occurrence of contact of this nature is at home plate between the runner and the catcher, as the catcher is well padded and locked into position that completely blocks home plate from the runner, and the runner will often try to knock the ball out of the catcher's hand by running him over. Since the catcher is seen (symbolically and literally) as the last line of defense, it seems natural that the more physical play happens here.\n\n===Innings and determining a winner===\nAn ''[[inning]]'' consists of each team having one turn in the field and one turn to hit, with the visiting team batting before the home team. A standard game lasts nine innings, although some leagues (such as high school baseball and [[Little League]]) play fewer. Most high school games last seven innings, and Little League has six innings. A single game between two teams during NCAA competition is nine innings. A doubleheader in NCAA competition may be two seven inning games, two nine inning games, or one nine inning game and one seven inning game between the same teams.  The team with the most runs at the end of the game wins. If the home team is ahead when the middle of the last inning is reached, it is declared the winner, and the last half-inning is not played. If the home team is trailing or tied in the last scheduled inning (or in an extra inning, see below) and they score to take the lead, the game ends as soon as the winning run touches home plate; however, if the last batter hits a home run to win the game, he and any runners on base are all permitted to score.\n\nIf both teams have scored the same number of runs at the end of a regular-length game, a [[tie (draw)|tie]] is avoided by the addition of [[extra innings]]. As many innings as necessary are played until one team has the lead at the end of an inning. Thus, the home team always has a chance to respond if the visiting team scores in the top half of the inning; this gives the home team a small tactical advantage. In theory, a baseball game could go on forever; in practice, however, they eventually end. In addition to that rule, a game might theoretically end if both the home and away team were to run out of players to substitute (see Substitutions, below). In Major League Baseball, the longest game played was a 26-inning affair between the [[Brooklyn Robins]] and [[Boston Braves (baseball)|Boston Braves]] on May 1, 1920. The game, called on account of darkness, ended in a 1\u20131 tie. Two [[minor league baseball|minor-league]] teams, the [[Pawtucket Red Sox]] and [[Rochester Red Wings]], played a [[longest professional baseball game|33-inning game]] in 1981.\n\nIn Major League Baseball, games end with tie scores only in rare cases when conditions make it impossible to continue play. A tie game does not count as a game in the standings\u2014a 2008 rule change made all tie games suspended unless and until not needed for the sake of determining playoff teams, and no longer replayed; however, though undecided, and not factored in the championship standings and the playoff reckoning, a tie game goes on the record and player and team statistics from it are counted. Inclement weather may also shorten games, but at least five innings must be played for the game to be considered official; four-and-a-half innings are enough if the home team is ahead. Previously, [[curfew]]s and the absence of adequate lighting caused more ties and shortened games\u2014now, games interrupted from ending in such circumstances are, at least initially, suspended. Also, with more modern playing surfaces better able to handle light rains, the process for calling or shortening a game due to weather has changed; it is more common than in the past to delay a game as much as two hours before a cancellation; also, a delay usually does not occur anymore until the rain is moderate-to-heavy and/or there is standing water on some part of the playing field.\n\nIn Japan's Nippon Professional Baseball, if the score remains tied after nine innings, up to three extra innings may be played (6 in the playoffs) before the game is called a tie. Since 2011 only regular season games have a 3-hour, 30-minute time limit. Some youth or amateur leagues will end a game early if one team is ahead by ten or more runs, a practice officially known as the \"runs ahead rule\" (sometimes referred to as a \"[[mercy rule]]\" or \"slaughter rule\"). Rarely, a game can also be won or lost by [[forfeit (baseball)|forfeit]].\n\nThere is a short break between each half-inning during which the new defensive team takes the field and the pitcher warms up. An existing pitcher is permitted five warm-up pitches and a new pitcher is permitted eight warm-up pitches.  The starting pitcher is permitted eight warm-up pitches to begin the game. Traditionally, the break between the top half and the bottom half of the seventh inning is known as the [[seventh-inning stretch]]. During the \"stretch\", fans in the United States often sing the chorus of ''[[Take Me Out to the Ball Game]]''.  However, since the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], ''[[God Bless America]]'' has often been added to it, especially at games in New York City and Washington, D.C., as well as during the [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star Game]] and the [[Major League Baseball postseason|postseason]].  In Atlanta and Baltimore it has been a tradition since 1974 to play \"Thank God I'm A Country Boy\" after \"[[Take Me Out To The Ballgame]]\" during the seventh-inning stretch. At Boston's [[Fenway Park]], a tradition has brought the singing of \"[[Sweet Caroline]]\" in the middle of the eighth inning.\n\n===Substitutions===\n{{Tone|section|date=April 2015}}\nEach team is allowed to substitute for any player at any time the ball is dead. A batter who replaces another batter is referred to as a ''[[pinch hitter (baseball)|pinch hitter]]''; similarly, a ''[[pinch runner (baseball)|pinch runner]]'' may be used as a replacement for a baserunner. Any player who replaces another player between innings, or while the team is in the field, is known as a \"defensive replacement\". A replacement pitcher is called a [[relief pitcher]].\n\nAny replacement is a permanent substitution; the replaced player may not return to the game under any circumstances. Thus, a pitcher that has been removed from the game and replaced by a relief pitcher cannot return to pitch later in the game, and any batter who is replaced by a pinch-hitter cannot take the field in the following inning (or even bat again if his turn comes up again in the same inning). Note however, that two players can switch defensive positions at any time, and both can still stay in the game\u2014because neither has actually been <u>removed</u> from the game.  This means that in at least one case, a pitcher switched positions with an outfielder in the middle of the game, with the outfielder becoming a relief pitcher ... then later in the game, the players switched back. This meant that in practical terms, the starting pitcher was relieved by another pitcher, but then came back to relieve the relief pitcher.  This game took place on September 28, 1952: the players in question were starting pitcher [[Harvey Haddix]], who moved to the outfield to make way for outfielder-turned relief pitcher [[Stan Musial]], then switched back to pitcher after Musial had faced one batter.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/SLN/SLN195209280.shtml |title=Archived copy |access-date=2018-03-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170924184319/https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/SLN/SLN195209280.shtml |archive-date=2017-09-24 |url-status=live }}</ref>  Note that this did not violate baseball's permanent substitution rule in any way, as at no time did either player leave the game.\n\nThis \"permanent substitution\" rule is in contrast to some other sports, such as basketball, hockey and American football, that practice \"free substitution\". In some cases, if the defensive manager responds to the entrance of a pinch-hitter by bringing in a new pitcher, the pinch-hitter may be replaced by another pinch-hitter without having even come to the plate, in which case the first pinch-hitter is considered to have entered the game and is ineligible to do so later.  However, the defensive manager may not replace a pitcher who has not pitched to at least one batter, except in case of injury. The reentry of a replaced player into the game is a violation of the permanent substitution rule; if the defense has more than nine players on the field at any time, the umpire must determine who is the tenth player, and that player is ejected from the game.\n\nMany [[amateur]] leagues allow a starting player who was removed to return to the game in the same position in the batting order under a re-entry rule. Youth leagues often allow free and open substitution to encourage player participation.\n\n====Pitchers as batters, and the designated hitter====\nPitching is a specialized skill, particularly in the collegiate and professional ranks; so most pitchers are relatively poor hitters, or, those who were skilled batsmen are simply unable to adequately hone their hitting skills to be comparable to everyday position players.  As a result, unless keeping a given pitcher in the game is a higher priority than the prospect of immediate offense, it is common to substitute for a pitcher when he is due to bat. This pinch hitter is typically then replaced by a relief pitcher when the team returns to the field on defense.\n\nA more complicated tactic is the [[Double switch (baseball)|double switch]], in which a pitching change is accompanied by the simultaneous replacement of another fielder.  If the pitcher is due to bat soon, and the outgoing fielder batted recently, the new pitcher will take the outgoing fielder's place in the batting order, thus delaying his next time at bat.  A common variation on this involves the introduction of a player who has just pinch hit (or pinch run for the pinch hitter) into the defensive alignment; unless this player becomes his team's next pitcher, another field player departs the game, and the new pitcher then assumes that player's place in the batting order.\n\nMany leagues allow [[designated hitter]]s, notably [[Major League Baseball]]'s [[American League]] (which instituted the Designated Hitter in 1973 to boost offensive output). A designated hitter (or DH) is a player whose sole purpose is to hit when it would normally be the pitcher's turn (or, in some leagues, if the pitcher is a good batter, another weaker batter). This is not considered a substitution, but rather a position, albeit a purely offensive one. A designated hitter does not play in the field on defense and may remain in the game regardless of changes in pitchers. If the designated hitter is moved to a fielding position, the team loses the DH, and the fielder whose position was taken by the former DH is replaced by the pitcher, who assumes that player's position in the hitting lineup.\n\nThe use of the designated hitter, which reduces the need for complicated strategy such as the double-switch, is opposed by many baseball traditionalists.  Nevertheless, it is used today at most levels of baseball in the United States and abroad. [[Major League Baseball]]'s [[National League]] is the most prominent league that still requires pitchers to bat.\n\n===Rosters===\nThe number of players on a major league roster is dictated by the labor agreements worked out between players and management. According to the current{{when|date=December 2012}}<!-- \"current\" is vague \u2013 when did teams start using the 25 man roster? --> rules, a team may have a maximum of 25 men on a roster from Opening Day until August 31. Beginning in the 2012 season, a major league team is allowed to carry a 26th man on its roster when playing the second game of a double-header that was scheduled at least 48 hours in advance.\n\nAfter August 31, during the regular season teams may call up additional personnel to the active roster, up to a maximum of 40 players. This number is seldom actually approached, however, with most teams' September rosters peaking at around 30 players.\n\nIn the postseason, rosters are fixed at 25 men.  Until 2007, teams could not replace players on their playoff rosters in the event of an injury and had to play out the series shorthanded.  Starting in 2007, an injured player could be placed on the disabled list and replaced by another player who was not included on the initial 25-man roster, but the injured player becomes available for the next round of the playoffs should his team advance.\n\n===Pace of play===\nRule changes have been implemented at different levels of baseball to quicken the [[pace of play]]. In college baseball, the [[Southeastern Conference]] experimented with a 20-second [[pitch clock]] during the 2010 season,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/gameon/post/2010/05/pitch-clock-for-baseball-experiment-begins-in-sec/1|title=Pitch clock for baseball?

The complete rules are published as the [http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/official_info/official_rules/foreword.jsp Official Baseball Rules at MLB.com], the official web site of [[Major League Baseball]] in the United States and Canada. The rules are also published in book form in North America by the ''[[Sporting News]]''. Many amateur and youth leagues use the \"OBR\" with only a few modifications for safety.\n\nOther slightly modified versions of the \"Official Baseball Rules\" are used in competitions operated by the [[International Baseball Federation]] (IBAF), including the [[Baseball at the Summer Olympics|Olympics]] and the [[Baseball World Cup|World Cup]], most leagues outside North America (such as Japan's [[Nippon Professional Baseball]]), and youth baseball organizations such as [[Little League]], [[PONY League]], and [[Cal Ripken, Sr. Collegiate Baseball League|Cal Ripken League]].\n\nThe baseball rulebook of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association]] (NCAA), aside from governing the games of that organization's members, is also used by several other competitions involving college-aged players.\n\nU.S. high school and high school-age baseball is governed by the rules of the [[National Federation of State High School Associations]] (NFHS).\n\n==Differences and evolution==\n\nFor the origins of the game, see [[rounders]], a game originating in England and Ireland. Unlike many other sports, the Official Baseball Rules have remained mainly static during the modern era of the game.  Many baseball players, fans, and administrators view the rules and traditions of professional baseball as time-tested and nearly sacrosanct.\n\nThis was not the case during baseball's early days, particularly in the late 19th century, when rules changed almost yearly, often significantly.  The game as we know it today really only began to take shape in the late 1880s, and even after that, many significant rule changes were made during the rest of that century.\n\nIn 1857, under the [[Knickerbocker Rules]] which governed until 1872, the current 9-inning format was adopted, replacing the previous rule that the first team to score 21 runs won.  The next year called strikes were recognized, and a batter was out if a ball, fair or foul, was caught on the fly or after one bounce. In 1867, the batter had the right to call for a high or low pitch, to be determined by the umpire.\n\nThe [[National League]] formed in 1876.  Its rules changed almost yearly for the next quarter century.  In 1880, a batter was out if the catcher caught the third strike; otherwise, the batter got four strikes.  Before 1883, pitchers were required to deliver pitches with their hand below their hips; in that year, the rule was changed to allow shoulder-high deliveries.  Until 1887, batters could call for either a high or low pitch, and the strike zone was either above or below the waist.  In 1885, the rules changed, until 1893, to allow bats to be flat on one side; beginning in 1893, they had to be round.  In 1887, the rules  changed so that batters could no longer call for a pitch; and the strike zone was defined as from the shoulders to the knees.  During this period, the pitcher's mound was much closer to home plate, foul balls were not counted as strikes, batters got four strikes, and the number of \"called balls\" resulting in a walk\u2014which initially included strikes and foul balls- went from 9 to 8 to 7 to 6 to 5 and, in 1889, to 4.  In that same year, the number of strikes went from 4 to 3.  In 1887, a rule was adopted for that year only counting walks as hits, which played havoc with statistics.  In 1892, the 154 game schedule was adopted.  In 1893, the pitcher's mound was moved from 50 to 60.5 feet from home plate.  In 1894, foul bunts were made strikes, and the [[infield fly rule]] was adopted with one out.  In 1895, foul tips were made strikes, but not foul balls.  In 1898, the first modern balk rule was adopted, as well as the modern rule for recognizing stolen bases.  In 1901, the infield fly rule was extended to apply when there were no outs.\n\nBecause of the frequent and often radical rule changes during this early period, the \"modern era\" is generally considered to have begun in 1901, when the [[American League]] was also formed.\n\nSome significant rule changes continued in the first quarter of the 20th century but were much less frequent.  In 1903, the American League adopted the foul strike rule.  In 1907, the sacrifice fly rule was adopted.  In 1910, cork centers were added to balls.  In 1925, the minimum distance for a home run was made 250 feet.\n\nAfter that, the rules remained virtually static for decades.  In 1961, the 162-game schedule was adopted.  In 1969, the pitcher's mound dropped five inches and the strike zone reduced:  from the armpits to the top of the knees.  In 1973, the American League adopted the [[designated hitter]] rule\u2014rejected to this day by the National League.  This was probably the most controversial rule change in baseball's history and is still subject to lively debate.  Also controversial when adopted was the later introduction of [[interleague play]].  The most recent significant rule changes, banning the use of steroids and other performance-enhancing substances, have had widespread support as protecting the integrity of the game.  The use of steroids by many players over the last two decades has called into question records for both hitting and pitching.\n\n==Gameplay==\n\n===General structure===\n[[Image:Baseball diamond.svg|thumb|right|Diagram of a [[baseball diamond]]]]\n\nBaseball is played between two teams with nine players in the field from the team that is not batting at that point (the batting team would have one batter in play at \"home plate\" on the field). On a [[baseball field]], the game is under the authority of several umpires. There are usually four umpires in major league games; up to six (and as few as one) may officiate depending on the league and the importance of the game. There are three ''[[base (baseball)|bases]]''. Numbered [[counterclockwise]], first, second, and third bases are cushions (sometimes informally referred to as ''bags'') shaped as 15&nbsp;in (38&nbsp;cm) squares which are raised a short distance above the ground; together with [[home plate]], the fourth \"base\", they form a square with sides of 90&nbsp;ft (27.4&nbsp;m) called the diamond.  Home plate is a pentagonal rubber slab 17&nbsp;in (43.2&nbsp;cm) wide. The playing field is divided into three main sections:\n*The infield, containing the four bases, is for general defensive purposes bounded by the foul lines and within the grass line (see figure).\n*The outfield is the grassed area beyond the infield grass line between the foul lines, and bounded by a wall or fence.\n*Foul territory is the entire area outside the foul lines.\n\n<!--  Commented out because image was deleted: [[Image:Pat-Burrell.jpg|thumb|[[Pat Burrell]] of the [[Philadelphia Phillies]] warms up in the '''On-deck circle''' as his teammate enters the '''batter's box''' (see diagram).]] -->\nThe pitcher's mound is located in the center of the infield. It is an 18&nbsp;ft (5.5&nbsp;m) diameter mound of dirt no higher than 10&nbsp;in (25.4&nbsp;cm). Near the center of the mound is the pitching rubber, a rubber slab positioned 60&nbsp;ft&nbsp;6&nbsp;in (18.4&nbsp;m) from home plate. The pitcher must have one foot on the rubber at the start of every pitch to a batter, but the pitcher may leave the mound area once the ball is released.\n\nAt the college/professional level, baseball is played in nine [[inning]]s in which each team gets one turn to [[#Batting|bat]] and tries to score ''[[run (baseball)|runs]]'' while the other pitches and defends in the field. High school baseball plays seven innings and [[Little League]] uses six-inning games. An inning is broken up into two halves in which the away team bats in the top (first) half, and the home team bats in the bottom (second) half. In baseball, the defense always has the ball\u2014a fact that differentiates it from most other team sports. The teams switch every time the defending team gets three players of the batting team ''[[out (baseball)|out]]''. The winner is the team with the most runs after nine innings. If the home team is ahead after the top of the ninth, play does not continue into the bottom half. When this happens, an X is put on the scoreboard for the home team's score in the ninth inning. In the case of a tie, additional innings are played until one team comes out ahead at the end of an inning. If the home team takes the lead anytime during the bottom of the ninth or of any inning after that, play stops and the home team is declared the winner. This is known as a walk-off.\n\n[[Image:Baseball swing.jpg|thumb|left|A batter follows through after swinging at a pitched ball.]]\nThe basic contest is always between the ''[[pitcher]]'' for the fielding team and a ''[[Batter (baseball)|batter]]''. The pitcher throws\u2014''[[pitch (baseball)|pitches]]''\u2014the ball towards home plate, where the ''[[catcher]]'' for the fielding team waits (in a crouched stance) to receive it. Behind the catcher stands the home plate umpire. The batter stands in one of the [[batter's box]]es and tries to hit the ball with a bat. The pitcher must keep one foot in contact with the top or front of the pitcher's rubber\u2014a 24\u00d76&nbsp;in (61\u00d715&nbsp;cm) plate located atop the pitcher's mound\u2014during the entire pitch, so he can only take one step backward and one forward in delivering the ball. The catcher's job is to receive any pitches that the batter does not hit and to \"call\" the game by a series of hand movements that signal to the pitcher what pitch to throw and where. The catcher also usually signals the desired location of the ball within the strike zone and \"sets up\" behind the plate or holds his glove up in the desired location as a target.  The catcher's role becomes more crucial depending on how the game is going, and how the pitcher responds to a given situation. Each pitch begins a new ''play'', which might consist of nothing more than the pitch itself.\n\nEach half-inning, the goal of the defending team is to get three members of the other team out. A player who is out must leave the field and wait for his next turn [[at bat]]. There are many ways to get batters and baserunners out; some of the most common are catching a batted ball [[in flight|in the air]], [[tag out]]s, [[force play|force outs]], and [[strikeout]]s. After the fielding team has put out three players from the opposing team, that half of the inning is over and the team in the field and the team at bat switch places; there is no upper limit to the number that may bat in rotation before three outs are recorded. Going through the entire order in an inning is referred to as \"batting around\" and it is indicative of a high-scoring inning. A complete inning consists of each opposing side having a turn (three outs) on offense.\n\nThe goal of the team at bat is to score more runs than the opposition; a player may do so by batting, then [[baserunning|becoming a baserunner]], touching all the bases in order (via one or more plays), and finally touching home plate. A player may also become a baserunner by being inserted as a [[Pinch runner|pinch-runner]]. To that end, the goal of each batter is to enable [[#Baserunning|baserunners]] to score or to become a baserunner himself. The batter attempts to hit the ball into [[fair territory]]\u2014between the baselines\u2014in such a way that the defending players cannot get them or the baserunners out. In general, the pitcher attempts to prevent this by pitching the ball in such a way that the batter cannot hit it cleanly or, ideally, at all.\n\nA baserunner who has successfully touched home plate without being retired (called out) after touching all previous bases  scores a ''[[run (baseball statistics)|run]]''. In an enclosed field, a [[fair ball]] hit over the fence on the fly is an automatic ''[[home run]]'', which entitles the batter and all runners to touch all the bases and score. On a field with foul poles, a ball that hits a pole is also a home run. A home run hit with all bases occupied ('[[bases loaded]]') is called a ''grand slam''.\n\n===Fielding team===<!-- This section is linked from [[Terry Puhl]] -->\n{{see also|Baseball positions|Baseball positioning}}\n\nThe squad in the field is the defensive team; they attempt to prevent the baserunners from scoring. There are nine defensive positions, but only two have a mandatory location (pitcher and catcher). The locations of the other seven fielders are not specified by the rules, except that at the moment the pitch is delivered, they must be positioned in fair territory and not in the space between the pitcher and the catcher. These fielders often shift their [[baseball positioning|positioning]] in response to specific batters or game situations, and they may exchange positions with one another at any time.\n\nThe nine positions most commonly used (with the number scorekeepers use) are: pitcher (1), catcher (2), first baseman (3), second baseman (4), third baseman (5), shortstop (6), left fielder (7), center fielder (8), and right fielder (9). Note that, in rare cases, teams may use dramatically differing schemes, such as switching an outfielder for an infielder. The numbering convention was established by [[Henry Chadwick (baseball writer)|Henry Chadwick]]. The reason the shortstop seems out of order has to do with the way fielders positioned themselves in the early years of the game. Each position is weighted on the [[defensive spectrum]] in terms of difficulty. The most difficult position is the catcher, while the least difficult is first base. Designated hitter, while on the scale, is not part of the defense at all. Pitchers, while part of the active defense, are so specialized in their role that they usually make only routine plays.\n\n====The battery====\nThe ''[[battery (baseball)|battery]]'' is composed of the ''[[pitcher]]'', who stands on the rubber of the mound, which is also known as the pitching plate, and the ''[[catcher]]'', who squats behind home plate. These are the two fielders who always deal directly with the batter on every pitch, hence the term \"battery\", coined by [[Henry Chadwick (baseball writer)|Henry Chadwick]] and later reinforced by the implied comparison to [[artillery]] fire.\n\nThe pitcher's main role is to [[pitch (baseball)|pitch]] the ball toward home plate with the goal of getting the batter [[out (baseball)|out]]. Pitchers also play defense by fielding batted balls, [[Covering a base|covering bases]] (for a potential [[tag out]] or [[force play|force out]] on an approaching runner), or backing up throws. The catcher's main role is to receive the pitch if the batter does not hit it. Together with the pitcher and coaches, the catcher plots game strategy by suggesting different pitches and by shifting the starting positions of the other fielders. Catchers are also responsible for defense in the area near home plate (such as [[Uncaught third strike|dropped third strikes]] and [[wild pitch]]es) or baserunning plays, most commonly when an opposing player attempts to [[Stolen base|steal a base]]. Due to the exceptional difficulty of the position, catchers are universally valued for their defensive prowess as opposed to their ability to hit.\n\n====The infielders====\nThe four infielders are the ''[[first baseman]]'', ''[[second baseman]]'', ''[[shortstop]]'', and ''[[third baseman]]''. Originally the first, second and third basemen played very near their respective bases, and the shortstop generally played \"in\" (hence the term), covering the area between second, third, and the pitchers box, or wherever the game situation required. As the game evolved, the fielding positions changed to the now-familiar \"umbrella\", with the first and third baseman generally positioned a short distance toward second base from their bases, the second baseman to the right side of second base standing farther away from the base than any other infielder, and the shortstop playing to the left of second base, as seen from the batter's perspective.\n\nThe [[first baseman]]'s job consists largely of making plays at first base on [[ground ball]]s hit to the other [[infielder]]s. When an infielder picks up a ball from the ground hit by the [[Batter (baseball)|batter]], he must throw it to the first baseman who must catch the ball and maintain contact with the base before the batter gets to it for the batter to be out. The need to do this quickly often requires the first baseman to stretch one of his legs to touch first base while catching the ball simultaneously. The first baseman must be able to catch the ball very well and usually wears a specially designed [[Baseball glove|mitt]]. The first baseman fields balls hit near first base. The first baseman also has to receive throws from the pitcher in order to tag runners out who have reached base safely. The position is less physically challenging than the other positions, but there is still a lot of skill involved. Infielders don't always make good throws to first base, so it is the first baseman's job to field any ball thrown toward him cleanly. Older players who can no longer fulfill the demands of their original positions also often become first basemen.\n\nThe second baseman covers the area to the first-base side of second base and provides backup for the first baseman in [[bunt (baseball)|bunt]] situations. He also is a cut-off for the [[outfield]]. The cut-off provides an intermediary between an outfielder and the infield so that the outfielder does not have to throw the entire distance if they've been forced to field the ball near the outer edge of the outfield. The shortstop fills the critical gap between second and third bases\u2014where right-handed batters generally hit ground balls\u2014and also covers second or third base and the near part of [[left field]]. This player is also a cut-off for the outfield. This position is the most demanding defensively, so a good shortstop doesn't need to necessarily be a good batter, though this has changed in modern times. The third baseman's primary requirement is a strong throwing arm, in order to make the long throw across the infield to the first baseman. Quick [[reaction time]] is also important for third basemen, as they tend to see more sharply-hit balls than do the other infielders, thus the nickname for third base as the \"hot corner\".  Also, because there are far more right-handed hitters than lefties, there are more ground balls hit to the left side of the infield due to the natural motion of the batter's swing.\n\n====The outfielders====\nThe three outfielders, ''[[left fielder]]'', ''[[center fielder]]'', and ''[[right fielder]]'', are so named from the [[catcher]]'s perspective looking out onto the field. The [[right fielder]] generally has the strongest arm of all the [[outfielder]]s due to the need to make throws on runners attempting to take [[Third baseman|third base]]. The [[center fielder]] has more territory to cover than the corner [[outfielder]]s, so this player must be quick and agile with a strong arm to throw balls into the [[Infielder|infield]]; as with the [[shortstop]], teams tend to emphasize defense at this position. Also, the [[center fielder]] is considered the [[outfield]] leader, and left- and right-fielders often cede to his direction when fielding [[Batted ball|fly ball]]s. Of all outfielders, the ''[[left fielder]]'' often has the weakest arm, as they generally do not need to throw the ball as far in order to prevent the advance of any baserunners. The left fielder still requires good fielding and catching skills, and tends to receive more balls than the right fielder due to the fact that right-handed hitters, who are much more common, tend to \"pull\" the ball into left field. Each outfielder runs to \"back up\" a nearby outfielder who attempts to field a ball hit near both their positions. Outfielders also run to back up infielders on batted balls and thrown balls, including pick-off attempts from the [[pitcher]] or from the [[catcher]].\n\n====Defensive strategy====\n\n=====Pitching=====\n[[Image:baseball pitching motion 2004.jpg|thumb|left|The typical motion of a right-handed pitcher]]\n{{main|Pitcher}}\n\nEffective pitching is critical to a baseball team, as pitching is the key for the defensive team to retire batters and to prevent runners from getting on base. A full game usually involves over one hundred pitches thrown by each team. However, most pitchers begin to tire before they reach this point. In previous eras, pitchers would often throw up to four complete games (all nine innings) in a week. With new advances in medical research and thus a better understanding of how the human body functions and tires out, starting pitchers tend more often to throw fractions of a game (typically six or seven innings, depending on their performance) about every five days (though a few complete games do still occur each year).\n\nA single game often requires multiple pitchers, including the [[starting pitcher]] and [[relief pitcher]](s). Pitchers are substituted for one another like any other player (see above), and the rules do not limit the number of pitchers that can be used in a game; the only limiting factor is the size of the squad, naturally. In general, starting pitchers are not used in relief situations except sometimes during the post-season when every game is vital. If a game runs into many extra innings, a team may well empty its [[bullpen]]. If it then becomes necessary to use a \"position player\" as a pitcher, major league teams generally have certain players designated as emergency relief pitchers, to avoid the embarrassment of using a less skillful player. In baseball's early years, squads were smaller, and relief pitchers were relatively uncommon, with the starter normally remaining for the entire game unless he was either thoroughly ineffective or became injured; today, with a much greater emphasis on pitch count, over the course of a single game each team will frequently use from two to five pitchers. In the [[2005 American League Championship Series|2005]] [[American League Championship Series|ALCS]], all four of the [[Chicago White Sox]] victories were complete games by the starters, a highly noteworthy event in the modern game.\n\nWhile delivering the ball, the pitcher has a great arsenal at his disposal in the variation of location, velocity, movement, and arm location (see [[list of baseball pitches|types of pitches]]). Most pitchers attempt to master two or three types of pitches; some pitchers throw up to 6 types of pitches with varying degrees of control. Common pitches include a [[fastball]], which is the ball thrown at high speed; a [[curveball]], which is made to curve by rotation imparted by the pitcher; a [[change-up]], which seeks to mimic the delivery of a fastball but arrives at significantly lower velocity; a [[Split Finger Fastball#Split-finger fastball|splitfinger fastball]], which attempts to mimic the delivery of a fastball, but has slight topspin rotation allowing the baseball to sink as it approaches the batter due to the position of the index finger and middle finger being \"split\" on the baseball; a [[Slider (baseball)|slider]], which is made to curve laterally by rotation imparted by the pitcher; a [[knuckleball]], which is held either by the knuckles closest to the nails or by the nails themselves allowing the pitcher to throw a baseball with little or no spin on the ball allowing the baseball to move in any direction; a [[Vulcan changeup]], which seeks to mimic the delivery of a fastball but arrives at a significant lower velocity due to the pitcher holding the baseball with the middle and ring fingers slightly apart; a [[circle changeup]], which is held in the palm of the hand with the index finger curled around the side of the baseball, allowing the pitcher to mimic the delivery of a fastball but arrives at a significantly lower velocity.\n\nTo illustrate pitching strategy, consider the \"fastball/change-up\" combination: The average major-league pitcher can throw a fastball around 90 miles per hour (145&nbsp;km/h), and a few pitchers have even exceeded {{convert|100|mph}} . The change-up is thrown somewhere between {{convert|75|to|85|mph}} . Since the batter's timing is critical to hitting a pitch, a batter swinging to hit what looks like a fastball, would be terribly fooled (swing and miss, hopefully) when the pitch turns out to be a much slower change-up.\n\nSome pitchers choose to throw using the '[[Submarine (baseball)|submarine style]],' a very efficient sidearm or near-underhand motion. Pitchers with a submarine delivery are often very difficult to hit because of the angle and movement of the ball once released. [[Walter Johnson]], who threw one of the fastest fastballs in the history of the game, threw sidearm (though not submarine) rather than a normal overhand. True underhanded pitching is permitted in Major League Baseball. However, it is difficult to generate enough velocity and movement with the underhand motion. Among modern Major League pitchers, [[Chad Bradford]] had the closest to an underhand delivery, with his knuckles sometimes scraping the ground. However, he is still usually considered a \"submarine\" pitcher.\n\n=====Fielding strategy=====\n[[Image:West Side Park 1906 World Series.JPG|thumb|left|[[1906 World Series]], infielders playing \"in\" for the expected bunt and the possible play at the plate with the [[bases loaded]], the same strategy 112 years ago as now.]]\n\nOnly the pitcher's and catcher's locations are fixed, and then only at the beginning of each pitch. Thus, the players on the field move around as needed to defend against scoring a run. Many variations of this are possible, as location depends upon the situation. Circumstances such as the number of outs, the count (balls and strikes) on the batter, the number and speed of runners, the ability of the fielders, the ability of the pitcher, the type of pitch thrown, the tendencies of the hitter, and the inning cause the fielders to move to more strategic locations on the field. Common defensive strategies include: playing for the bunt, trying to prevent a [[stolen base]], moving to a shallow position to throw out a runner at home, playing at \"[[double play]] depth\", and moving fielders to locations where hitters are most likely to hit the ball.\n{{clear}}\n\n===Batting team===\n\n====Batters and runners====\nThe ultimate goal of the team at bat is to score runs. To accomplish this task, the team at bat successively (in a predetermined order called a ''lineup'' or ''[[batting order (baseball)|batting order]]'') sends its nine players to the batter's box (adjacent to home plate) where they become batters. (Each team sets its batting lineup at the beginning of the game. Changes to the lineup are tightly limited by the rules of baseball and must be communicated to the umpires, who have the substitutions announced for the opposing team and fans. See [[#Substitutions|Substitutions]] below.)\n\nA batter's turn at the plate is called a ''[[plate appearance]]''. Batters can advance to first base safely in one of seven methods: a [[Hit (baseball)|base-hit]] (abbreviated 'H') or [[Base on balls|walk]] ('BB' for base-on-balls) are by far the most common; being [[Hit by pitch|hit-by-the-pitch]] ('HBP'), reaching by [[Error (baseball)|error]] ('E') or [[fielder's choice]] ('FC') are less common; and somewhat rarely a player may reach base by virtue of [[Interference (baseball)|interference]] ('I') or a [[passed ball]] ('PB') on a [[strike-out]], where the player is allowed to run and reach base safely if he can. When the batter hits a fair ball, he must run to first base, and may continue or stop at any base unless he is put out. A successful hit occurs when the batter reaches a base: reaching only first base is a ''single''; reaching second base, a ''double''; third base, a ''triple''; and a hit that allows the batter to touch all bases in order on the same play is a [[home run]]\u2014whether the ball is hit over the fence does not matter (if the ball is not hit over the fence and the batter touches all bases, it is usually referred to as an \"inside-the-park home run\"). Once a runner is held to a base, he may attempt to advance at any time, but is not required to do so unless the batter or another runner displaces him (called a force play). A batter always drops his bat when running the bases; otherwise, the bat would slow him down and could give rise to a call of interference if it were to contact the ball or a fielder. However, if a batter hits the ball, and the batter or the dropped bat touches the ball, it is considered a dead ball.\n\nDepending on the way the ball comes off the bat, the play has different names. A batted ball is called a fly ball if it is hit in the air in an upward arc, such that a fielder might be able to catch it before it hits the ground. A batted ball is called a ''[[ground ball]]'' if it hits the ground within the infield before it can be caught, often due to being hit in a downward trajectory. Several different names are used to describe fly balls, depending on their trajectory. A ball hit high in the air and seemingly almost straight up is called a \"pop-up\". A ball hit forcefully in a fast-moving and seemingly almost straight-line trajectory is called a ''[[line drive]]''. A \"shallow\" fly ball, hit with just enough force to possibly land between the infielders and the outfielders, is often call a \"blooper\". A \"deep\" fly ball is hit with enough force to approach and possibly clear the outfield fence.\n\nWhen a ball is hit outside the foul lines, it is a ''foul ball'', requiring the batter and all runners to return to their respective bases, whether it is caught or not. Additionally, if a ground ball or a bunted ball lands in foul territory and the ball rolls back into bounds before reaching either first or third bases without being touched by either a fielder or a runner, then said ball is considered fair.\n\nOnce the batter and any existing runners have all stopped at a base or been put out, the ball is returned to the pitcher, and the next batter comes to the plate. After the opposing team bats in its own order and three more outs are recorded, the first team's batting order will continue again from where it left off.\n\nWhen a runner reaches home plate, he scores a run and is no longer a base runner. He must leave the playing area until his spot in the order comes up again. A runner may only circle the bases once per plate appearance and thus can score no more than a single run.\nIn the American, Pacific, and both Cuban leagues, there is a tenth player, a designated hitter, who bats for the pitcher.\n\n====Batting====\n{{main|Batting (baseball)}}\nEach [[plate appearance]] consists of a series of pitches, in which the [[pitcher]] throws the ball towards home plate while a batter is standing in the [[batter's box]] (either right or left). With each pitch, the batter must decide whether to swing the bat at the ball in an attempt to hit it. The pitches arrive quickly, so the [[Reaction time|decision to swing]] must be made in less than a tenth of a second, based on whether the ball is hittable and in the ''[[strike zone]]'', a region defined by the area directly above home plate and between the hollow beneath the batter's knee and the midpoint between the top of the shoulders and the top of the uniform pants. In addition to swinging at the ball, a batter who wishes to put the ball in play may hold his bat over home plate and attempt to tap a pitch lightly; this is called a [[bunt (baseball)|bunt]]. Good bunting technique has been described as \"catching the ball with the bat.\"\n\nOn any pitch, if the batter swings at the ball and misses, he is charged with a ''[[strike (baseball statistics)|strike]]''. If the batter does not swing, the home plate [[umpire (baseball)|umpire]] judges whether the ball passed through the strike zone. If the ball, or any part of it, passed through the zone, it is ruled a strike; otherwise, it is called a ''[[ball (baseball statistics)|ball]]''. The number of balls and strikes thrown to the current batter is known as the [[count (baseball)|count]]; the count is always given balls first (except in Japan, where it is reversed), then strikes (such as 3\u20132 or \"three and two\", also known as a \"full count\", which would be 3 balls and 2 strikes).\n\nIf the batter swings and makes contact with the ball, but does not put it in play in fair territory\u2014a ''[[foul ball]]''\u2014he is charged with an additional strike, except when there are already two strikes. Thus, a foul ball with two strikes leaves the count unchanged. (However, a noted exception to this rule is that a ball bunted foul with two strikes is a strikeout.) If a pitch is batted foul or fair and a member of the defensive team is able to catch it, before the ball strikes the ground, the batter is declared out. In the event that a bat deflects the ball sharply and directly back toward the catcher's box, it is a ''[[foul tip]]''. If a ball ruled as a foul tip is caught, with two strikes in the count,  it is considered a counted third strike and an out; if not initially caught by the catcher, it remains a foul ball with two strikes.\n\nWhen three strikes occur on a batter, it is a ''[[strikeout]]'' and the batter is automatically out unless the pitch is not caught by the catcher or if the pitch bounces before it is caught. It is then ruled an [[uncaught third strike]], an exception to the third strike rule: If the catcher drops the third strike, the batter is permitted to attempt to advance to first base if there are two outs in the inning or if it is unoccupied. In this case, the batter is not out (although the pitcher is awarded a strikeout). The catcher can try to get the batter out by tagging him with the ball or throwing the ball to first base to put him out. (See [[Doug Eddings|Doug Eddings (2005 ALCS)]] and [[Mickey Owen|Mickey Owen (1941 World Series)]] for famous examples of dropped third strikes that dramatically altered the course of post-season series.)\n\nOn the fourth [[ball (baseball statistics)|ball]], it is called a walk, and the batter becomes a runner, and is entitled to advance to first base without risk of being put out, called a ''[[base on balls]]'' or a ''walk'' (abbreviated BB). If a pitch touches the batter (or the batter's clothes), the umpire declares a ''[[hit by pitch]]'' (abbreviated HBP) and the batter is awarded first base, unless the umpire determines that the ball was in the strike zone when it hit the batter, or that the batter did not attempt to avoid being hit.  In practice, neither exception is ever called unless the batter obviously tries to get hit by the pitch; even standing still in the box will virtually always be overlooked, and the batter awarded first.  In addition, if the batter swings at a pitch that hits him, it counts as a strike.  If the catcher's mitt, catcher's mask, or any part of the catcher comes in contact with the batter and/or the batter's bat as the batter is attempting to hit a pitch, the batter is awarded first base, ruled \"catcher's interference\".\n\n====Baserunning====\n{{main|Baserunning}}\nOnce a batter becomes a runner and reaches first base safely, he is said to be \"on\" that base until he attempts to advance to the next base, until he is put out, or until the half-inning ends. In order to be safe a runner must beat the ball to the bag. When two or more runners are on the basepaths, the runner farther along is called a ''lead runner'' or a ''preceding runner''; any other runner is called a ''trailing runner'' or a ''following runner''. Runners on second or third base are considered to be in ''scoring position'' since ordinary hits, even singles, will often allow them to score.\n\nA runner legally touching a base is \"[[Safe (baseball)|safe]]\"\u2014in most situations he may not be put out. Runners may attempt to advance from base to base at any time (except when the [[dead ball (baseball)|ball is dead]]).  A runner that must attempt to advance is [[force play|forced]] , when all previous bases are occupied and a batted ball that touches the ground is a fair ball. The runner forced to advance toward the next base is considered \"forced out\" if a fielder holding the baseball touches the intended base before the baserunner arrives. When a batted ball is hit in the air, i.e., a ''fly ball'', and caught by the defending team, runners must return and \"retouch\" the base they occupied at the [[time of pitch|time of the pitch]]. The common name for this requirement is ''[[tag up|tagging up]].'' If the runner retouches the origin base at any time after the fly ball is first touched by a fielder, he may attempt to advance to the next base or bases at his own risk. The penalty for failing to retouch (if the defensive team notices this) is that the advancing runner can be put out on a live appeal in which the defensive team player with the ball touches the base from which that runner departed prematurely. If a runner tagged up and tries to run to the next base in sequence, they are deemed out if tagged by an infielder at any point before reaching the base or the ball arrives at the base ahead of the runner. However, if the runner is not forced to run to the next base in sequence, they are not deemed out until they are tagged.  This often leads to a runner being trapped between two or more infielders trying to tag them before reaching any base: a situation known as being \"caught in no-man's-land\".\n\nOnly one runner may occupy a base at a time; if two runners are touching a base at once, the trailing runner is [[in jeopardy]] and will be out if [[tag out|tagged]]. However, if the trail runner reached the base having been forced there, it is the lead runner who will be out when tagged for failing to reach his [[force base]]. Either such occurrence is very rare. Thus, after a play, at most three runners may be on the basepaths, one on each base\u2014first, second, and third. When three runners are on base, this is called ''bases loaded''.\n\n[[Image:Baseball pick-off attempt.jpg|thumb|right|Pick-off attempt on runner (in red) at first base]]\n\nBaserunners may attempt to advance, or [[stolen base|steal a base]], while the pitcher is preparing to make a pitch, while he is making a pitch, or while waiting for a return throw from the catcher after a pitch. The pitcher, in lieu of delivering the pitch, may try to prevent this by throwing the ball to one of the infielders in order to tag the runner; if successful, it is called a ''pick-off''. He may also, as part of a planned sequence, throw a pitch well outside and high of the strike zone to his catcher who is waiting for it upright there, and is thus better prepared to throw out a runner trying to steal; this sequence is called a \"pitchout.\" If the runner attempts to steal the next base but is tagged out before reaching it safely, he is ''caught stealing''. An illegal attempt by the pitcher to deceive a runner, among other pitching violations, is called a [[balk]], allowing all runners to advance one base without risk of being put out.\n\nAnother fundamental tenet of the rules of baseball is that a runner who was initially ruled out can subsequently be ruled safe, but once a runner is ruled safe he cannot be called out on the same play, unless he overruns the base. For example, if a baserunner steals second base, beating the throw, an umpire might make the quick call of safe, but if the runner then slides beyond the base and is tagged before he can retreat to it the umpire has the right to change the call. A runner initially called out can be subsequently ruled safe if the fielder putting the runner out drops the ball (on either a tag or force play), pulls his foot off the base (in the case of a force play), or otherwise illegally [[Obstruction (baseball)|obstructs]] a runner from reaching a base that he otherwise would have reached safely.\n\n====Batting and base running strategy====\nThe goal of each batter is to become a base runner himself (by a [[hit (baseball)|base hit]], a [[base on balls]], being [[hit by pitch|hit by the pitch]], a [[error (baseball)|fielding error]], or [[fielder's choice]]) or to help move other base runners along (by another [[hit (baseball)|base hit]], a [[sacrifice bunt]], [[sacrifice fly]], or [[hit and run (baseball)|hit and run]]).\n\nBatters attempt to \"read\" pitchers through pre-game preparation by studying the tendencies of pitchers and by talking to other batters that previously faced the pitcher. While batting, batters attempt to \"read\" pitches by looking for clues that the pitcher or catcher reveal. These clues (also referred to as \"tipping pitches\") include movements of the pitcher's arms, shoulders, body, etc., or the positioning of the catcher's feet and glove. Batters can attempt to \"read\" the spin of a ball early in the pitch to anticipate its trajectory.\n\nBatters also remain keenly aware of the count during their at bat. The count is considered to be in the batter's favor when there are more balls than strikes (e.g., two balls and no strikes). This puts pressure on the pitcher to throw a strike to avoid a walk so the batter is more likely to get an easier pitch to hit and can look for a particular pitch in a particular zone or take a riskier or bigger swing. The count is considered to be in the pitcher's favor when there are fewer balls than strikes (e.g., no balls and two strikes). This gives the pitcher more freedom to try enticing the batter to swing at a pitch outside the strike zone or throwing a pitch that is harder to control (e.g. a [[curve ball|curve]], [[Slider (baseball)|slider]] or [[split-finger fastball|splitter]]), but that is also harder to hit. Thus the batter will take a more protective swing.\n\nA major strategy in batting at competitive levels of baseball is patient hitting. An example of patient hitting is when a batter has a zero strike count, the batter will almost always look for his perfect pitch. One strike hitting is very similar to no strike hitting and the batter usually is still looking for a good pitch to hit. Two strike hitting, the strategy is changed where the batter will protect the plate by fouling off pitches until the batter is able to find a pitch to hit. This style of hitting allows the hitter to look for a good pitch to hit, and makes the pitcher throw more pitches so that he will tire out faster. This is critical if the batting team is facing a very skilled pitcher who, if allowed to, will take over the game with his ability to get batters to do what he wants them to do.\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Baseball slide.jpg|thumb|right|A third base coach (left) signals from the [[coach's box]] for the runner to [[slide (baseball)|slide]] head first into 3rd base]] -->\nIn general, base running is a tactical part of the game requiring good judgment by runners (and their coaches) to assess the risk in attempting to advance. During [[tag out|tag]] plays, a good [[slide (baseball)|slide]] can affect the outcome of the play. Managers will sometimes simultaneously send a runner and require the batter to swing (a [[hit and run (baseball)|hit-and-run]] play) in an attempt to advance runners. On a hit-and-run play the batter will often try to hit to the opposite field (the opposite of the natural tendency for the right-handed hitter to pull the ball to left field and vice versa).  Hitting to the opposite field will likely find an opening in the infield vacated by the fielder covering second base.  This is because coverage of second base against a steal is best achieved by whichever fielder is closer to second base, the shortstop or the second baseman; and such positioning is aimed at defending against the natural tendency of the hitter.\n\nTypically, the first and second batters are [[contact hitter]]s, who try to make contact with the ball to put it in play, and then run fast to reach base. The third batter is generally the best all-around hitter on the team, who tries to help baserunners to score runs, and if possible to reach base himself. The fourth batter is the [[cleanup hitter]], and is often a [[power hitter]], who tries to hit home runs.\n\nThe fifth and sixth batters often help baserunners to score runs. They often \"sacrifice\" his [[at-bat]]. This can be done by [[sacrifice bunt|bunting]] the ball, hitting a [[sacrifice fly|fly ball]] far enough in the air that a baserunner can advance after the catch, or simply making contact with the ball on a hit-and-run play.\n\nDuring the course of play many offensive and defensive players run close to each other, and during tag plays, the defensive player must touch the offensive player. Although baseball is considered a non-contact sport, a runner may be allowed to make potentially dangerous contact with a fielder as part of an attempt to reach base, unless that fielder is fielding a batted ball. (Noted exceptions to the dangerous contact rule are found throughout amateur competitions, including youth leagues, high school, and college baseball.) A good slide is often more advantageous than such contact, and \"malicious\" contact by runners is typically prohibited as offensive [[interference (baseball)|interference]]. The most common occurrence of contact of this nature is at home plate between the runner and the catcher, as the catcher is well padded and locked into position that completely blocks home plate from the runner, and the runner will often try to knock the ball out of the catcher's hand by running him over. Since the catcher is seen (symbolically and literally) as the last line of defense, it seems natural that the more physical play happens here.\n\n===Innings and determining a winner===\nAn ''[[inning]]'' consists of each team having one turn in the field and one turn to hit, with the visiting team batting before the home team. A standard game lasts nine innings, although some leagues (such as high school baseball and [[Little League]]) play fewer. Most high school games last seven innings, and Little League has six innings. A single game between two teams during NCAA competition is nine innings. A doubleheader in NCAA competition may be two seven inning games, two nine inning games, or one nine inning game and one seven inning game between the same teams.  The team with the most runs at the end of the game wins. If the home team is ahead when the middle of the last inning is reached, it is declared the winner, and the last half-inning is not played. If the home team is trailing or tied in the last scheduled inning (or in an extra inning, see below) and they score to take the lead, the game ends as soon as the winning run touches home plate; however, if the last batter hits a home run to win the game, he and any runners on base are all permitted to score.\n\nIf both teams have scored the same number of runs at the end of a regular-length game, a [[tie (draw)|tie]] is avoided by the addition of [[extra innings]]. As many innings as necessary are played until one team has the lead at the end of an inning. Thus, the home team always has a chance to respond if the visiting team scores in the top half of the inning; this gives the home team a small tactical advantage. In theory, a baseball game could go on forever; in practice, however, they eventually end. In addition to that rule, a game might theoretically end if both the home and away team were to run out of players to substitute (see Substitutions, below). In Major League Baseball, the longest game played was a 26-inning affair between the [[Brooklyn Robins]] and [[Boston Braves (baseball)|Boston Braves]] on May 1, 1920. The game, called on account of darkness, ended in a 1\u20131 tie. Two [[minor league baseball|minor-league]] teams, the [[Pawtucket Red Sox]] and [[Rochester Red Wings]], played a [[longest professional baseball game|33-inning game]] in 1981.\n\nIn Major League Baseball, games end with tie scores only in rare cases when conditions make it impossible to continue play. A tie game does not count as a game in the standings\u2014a 2008 rule change made all tie games suspended unless and until not needed for the sake of determining playoff teams, and no longer replayed; however, though undecided, and not factored in the championship standings and the playoff reckoning, a tie game goes on the record and player and team statistics from it are counted. Inclement weather may also shorten games, but at least five innings must be played for the game to be considered official; four-and-a-half innings are enough if the home team is ahead. Previously, [[curfew]]s and the absence of adequate lighting caused more ties and shortened games\u2014now, games interrupted from ending in such circumstances are, at least initially, suspended. Also, with more modern playing surfaces better able to handle light rains, the process for calling or shortening a game due to weather has changed; it is more common than in the past to delay a game as much as two hours before a cancellation; also, a delay usually does not occur anymore until the rain is moderate-to-heavy and/or there is standing water on some part of the playing field.\n\nIn Japan's Nippon Professional Baseball, if the score remains tied after nine innings, up to three extra innings may be played (6 in the playoffs) before the game is called a tie. Since 2011 only regular season games have a 3-hour, 30-minute time limit. Some youth or amateur leagues will end a game early if one team is ahead by ten or more runs, a practice officially known as the \"runs ahead rule\" (sometimes referred to as a \"[[mercy rule]]\" or \"slaughter rule\"). Rarely, a game can also be won or lost by [[forfeit (baseball)|forfeit]].\n\nThere is a short break between each half-inning during which the new defensive team takes the field and the pitcher warms up. An existing pitcher is permitted five warm-up pitches and a new pitcher is permitted eight warm-up pitches.  The starting pitcher is permitted eight warm-up pitches to begin the game. Traditionally, the break between the top half and the bottom half of the seventh inning is known as the [[seventh-inning stretch]]. During the \"stretch\", fans in the United States often sing the chorus of ''[[Take Me Out to the Ball Game]]''.  However, since the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], ''[[God Bless America]]'' has often been added to it, especially at games in New York City and Washington, D.C., as well as during the [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star Game]] and the [[Major League Baseball postseason|postseason]].  In Atlanta and Baltimore it has been a tradition since 1974 to play \"Thank God I'm A Country Boy\" after \"[[Take Me Out To The Ballgame]]\" during the seventh-inning stretch. At Boston's [[Fenway Park]], a tradition has brought the singing of \"[[Sweet Caroline]]\" in the middle of the eighth inning.\n\n===Substitutions===\n{{Tone|section|date=April 2015}}\nEach team is allowed to substitute for any player at any time the ball is dead. A batter who replaces another batter is referred to as a ''[[pinch hitter (baseball)|pinch hitter]]''; similarly, a ''[[pinch runner (baseball)|pinch runner]]'' may be used as a replacement for a baserunner. Any player who replaces another player between innings, or while the team is in the field, is known as a \"defensive replacement\". A replacement pitcher is called a [[relief pitcher]].\n\nAny replacement is a permanent substitution; the replaced player may not return to the game under any circumstances. Thus, a pitcher that has been removed from the game and replaced by a relief pitcher cannot return to pitch later in the game, and any batter who is replaced by a pinch-hitter cannot take the field in the following inning (or even bat again if his turn comes up again in the same inning). Note however, that two players can switch defensive positions at any time, and both can still stay in the game\u2014because neither has actually been <u>removed</u> from the game.  This means that in at least one case, a pitcher switched positions with an outfielder in the middle of the game, with the outfielder becoming a relief pitcher ... then later in the game, the players switched back. This meant that in practical terms, the starting pitcher was relieved by another pitcher, but then came back to relieve the relief pitcher.  This game took place on September 28, 1952: the players in question were starting pitcher [[Harvey Haddix]], who moved to the outfield to make way for outfielder-turned relief pitcher [[Stan Musial]], then switched back to pitcher after Musial had faced one batter.<ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/SLN/SLN195209280.shtml |title=Archived copy |access-date=2018-03-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170924184319/https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/SLN/SLN195209280.shtml |archive-date=2017-09-24 |url-status=live }}</ref>  Note that this did not violate baseball's permanent substitution rule in any way, as at no time did either player leave the game.\n\nThis \"permanent substitution\" rule is in contrast to some other sports, such as basketball, hockey and American football, that practice \"free substitution\". In some cases, if the defensive manager responds to the entrance of a pinch-hitter by bringing in a new pitcher, the pinch-hitter may be replaced by another pinch-hitter without having even come to the plate, in which case the first pinch-hitter is considered to have entered the game and is ineligible to do so later.  However, the defensive manager may not replace a pitcher who has not pitched to at least one batter, except in case of injury. The reentry of a replaced player into the game is a violation of the permanent substitution rule; if the defense has more than nine players on the field at any time, the umpire must determine who is the tenth player, and that player is ejected from the game.\n\nMany [[amateur]] leagues allow a starting player who was removed to return to the game in the same position in the batting order under a re-entry rule. Youth leagues often allow free and open substitution to encourage player participation.\n\n====Pitchers as batters, and the designated hitter====\nPitching is a specialized skill, particularly in the collegiate and professional ranks; so most pitchers are relatively poor hitters, or, those who were skilled batsmen are simply unable to adequately hone their hitting skills to be comparable to everyday position players.  As a result, unless keeping a given pitcher in the game is a higher priority than the prospect of immediate offense, it is common to substitute for a pitcher when he is due to bat. This pinch hitter is typically then replaced by a relief pitcher when the team returns to the field on defense.\n\nA more complicated tactic is the [[Double switch (baseball)|double switch]], in which a pitching change is accompanied by the simultaneous replacement of another fielder.  If the pitcher is due to bat soon, and the outgoing fielder batted recently, the new pitcher will take the outgoing fielder's place in the batting order, thus delaying his next time at bat.  A common variation on this involves the introduction of a player who has just pinch hit (or pinch run for the pinch hitter) into the defensive alignment; unless this player becomes his team's next pitcher, another field player departs the game, and the new pitcher then assumes that player's place in the batting order.\n\nMany leagues allow [[designated hitter]]s, notably [[Major League Baseball]]'s [[American League]] (which instituted the Designated Hitter in 1973 to boost offensive output). A designated hitter (or DH) is a player whose sole purpose is to hit when it would normally be the pitcher's turn (or, in some leagues, if the pitcher is a good batter, another weaker batter). This is not considered a substitution, but rather a position, albeit a purely offensive one. A designated hitter does not play in the field on defense and may remain in the game regardless of changes in pitchers. If the designated hitter is moved to a fielding position, the team loses the DH, and the fielder whose position was taken by the former DH is replaced by the pitcher, who assumes that player's position in the hitting lineup.\n\nThe use of the designated hitter, which reduces the need for complicated strategy such as the double-switch, is opposed by many baseball traditionalists.  Nevertheless, it is used today at most levels of baseball in the United States and abroad. [[Major League Baseball]]'s [[National League]] is the most prominent league that still requires pitchers to bat.\n\n===Rosters===\nThe number of players on a major league roster is dictated by the labor agreements worked out between players and management. According to the current{{when|date=December 2012}}<!-- \"current\" is vague \u2013 when did teams start using the 25 man roster? --> rules, a team may have a maximum of 25 men on a roster from Opening Day until August 31. Beginning in the 2012 season, a major league team is allowed to carry a 26th man on its roster when playing the second game of a double-header that was scheduled at least 48 hours in advance.\n\nAfter August 31, during the regular season teams may call up additional personnel to the active roster, up to a maximum of 40 players. This number is seldom actually approached, however, with most teams' September rosters peaking at around 30 players.\n\nIn the postseason, rosters are fixed at 25 men.  Until 2007, teams could not replace players on their playoff rosters in the event of an injury and had to play out the series shorthanded.  Starting in 2007, an injured player could be placed on the disabled list and replaced by another player who was not included on the initial 25-man roster, but the injured player becomes available for the next round of the playoffs should his team advance.\n\n===Pace of play===\nRule changes have been implemented at different levels of baseball to quicken the [[pace of play]]. In college baseball, the [[Southeastern Conference]] experimented with a 20-second [[pitch clock]] during the 2010 season,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/gameon/post/2010/05/pitch-clock-for-baseball-experiment-begins-in-sec/1|title=Pitch clock for baseball?

The sacred mountain, close to Nice, in the Alpes Maritimes and part of the [[Mercantour National Park]], currently being included in the UNESCO world heritage list.  For thousands of years, from the Stone Age all the way to the Iron Age, the first inhabitants of Europe were climbing all the way to the top of Mount Bego along the Canyons of the Valley of the Roya river starting from the Mediterranean Sea. They have recorded their early expressions of observing nature in more than thirty thousand graffiti on the stones of the [[Vall\u00e9e des Merveilles]]. The Belvederois remained as anonymous inhabitants of this part of Ligurie (Liguria) living on the fringes of the sacred mountain. There are some vestiges of their ancient fortifications for example there is evidence of a part of a fort behind the church, which can be considered as the prehistoric beginnings of the actual village.[[File:\u041f\u043e\u0440\u0442\u0440\u0435\u0442 \u041a\u043e\u0440\u043d\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0438 \u0421\u0430\u043b\u043e\u043d\u0438\u043d\u044b.jpg|thumb|left|100px|Cornelia Salonina took the waters nearby.]]\n\n===The Gauls===\nIn 500 BC the Gauls infiltrated the Ligurian coast and arrived in the mountains around. The inhabitants of Massalia (Marseilles) founded colonies along the coast: Antibes, Monaco, Nice. Farmers spread inland raising vines and olives without however reducing the independence of the mountain dwellers\n\n===The Romans===\nThe Romans crossed the Alps Maritimes to secure a passage to Nice & Marseilles and to fight in Spain. In 125 BC they annexed the inland areas to found the Roman province of Provence followed by the Alpine regions as far as Tyrol. Belvedere was occupied and noble Romans of Cimez (Nice) who spent summers in Belvedere and developed the thermal baths at the nearby mountain village of [[:fr:Berthemont-les-Bains|Berthemont-les-Bains]].

The first of the Counts who would dominate the region during the Middle Ages]]. In the 5th century, the Germans finally overwhelmed the Western Roman Empire. They disputed Provence with the [[Visigoths]], then the [[Ostrogoths]] installed themselves, followed by the [[Lombards]] and finally the [[Franks|Francs]], who organised and administered the region and repulsed the raiding [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanids]](Arabs) in the 7th & 8th centuries, whose attacks penetrating as far as the Vesubie.\n\n===Under the Counts of Provence===\nAt the dawn of the millennium Belvedere was part the kingdom of Burgundy.[[Rudolph II of Burgundy|Rudolf II]] (880\u2013937), was ruler of Upper Burgundy (912\u2013937), Lower Burgundy (Provence) (933\u2013937) and also ruled Italy for nearly four years (923\u2013926) during the chaotic period at the end of the [[Carolingian dynasty|Carolingian]] era. However, in 926 the Italian nobility turned against him and requested that [[Hugh of Italy|Hugh of Arles]],Comte d'Arles, the effective ruler of Provence (or Lower Burgundy), rule them instead. Rudolf returned to Upper Burgundy to protect himself, assuring Hugh's coronation as King of Italy in the process. The Counts would dominate the region until 1388, effectively for the duration of the Middle Ages. It was the feudal era with a lord or Seigneur for each village, but most areas maintained their autonomy and Luceram, Utelle and Saint Martin Vesubie, like Belvedere, administered themselves. After the death of Queen Jeanne (1382), Amadeus VII Count of Savoy, Aosta and Maurienne, the Red Earl, taking advantage of the subsequent war of succession in Provence negotiated the succession of Nice to Savoy with Baron Jean Grimaldi Bueil, who was seneschal of Provence and commander of the garrison defending Nice. Ruined by war, the inhabitants of Nice and the countries aligned themselves with the policy of John Grimaldi and accepted the protection of the House of Savoy through the Treaty of Saint Pons, known as the Revocation of Nice to Savoy.[[File:Western Europe Utrecht Treaty.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Western Europe|Western Europe's]] borders after the Treaties of Utrecht, which took Bevedere into the Kingdom of Sardinia.]]\n\n===The Princes of Savoy===\nThe Princes of Savoy were French by race and language and Belvedere remained a French village. But for the majority of the period from 1388 until 1713 the successors of the Red Earl, Amedee VII, successively allied themselves with enemies of France. As a result, the \"Pays Nicois\" was crossed by hostile armies and subjected to incessant devastation, particularly following the battles between Charles V and Francis 1st (1494\u20131547).\nThis unhappy situation continued off and on until after the war of Spanish Succession when at the Treaty of Utrecht (1713)  Louis XIV of France and Philip V of Spain, on the one hand, met representatives of Queen Anne of Great Britain, the Duke of Savoy, and the United Provinces on the other and divided up Spain's European empire. Savoy received Sicily and parts of the Duchy of Milan, while Charles VI (the Holy Roman Emperor and Archduke of Austria, received the Spanish Netherlands, the Kingdom of Naples, Sardinia, and the bulk of the Duchy of Milan. \nThen in 1723, or in 1720 according to the international law the crown of Sardinia was awarded by the Treaty of The Hague to King Victor Amadeus II of Savoy to compensate him for the loss of the crown of Sicily to Austria, enabling him to retain the title of king. Besides Sardinia, the new kingdom with its capital in Turin included Savoy, Piedmont, and Nice with the result that Belvedere from now on was part of the Kingdom of Sardinia which included Savoy, Piedmont, the Comte de Nice and Sardinia and thus it remained until 1860.\n\n===Under the Sardinian Regime===\nDuring this period Belvedere lived under a foreign flag: however, the Pays Nicois benefited from the general peace and progress. The beautiful countryside, mild climate, and verdant agriculture attracted, all along the coast, rich residents which benefited many of the villages. Cultural life developed, but villages like Belvedere stayed isolated and life remained primitive without passable roads or commerce. Belvedere, like its neighbours, retreated into itself and in effect formed a little independent republic. The French Revolution of 1789 brought a disruption, which the people supported without getting any benefits from it.\n\n===The Revolution and a return to France===\nSituated just over the frontier of France, from which it was separated by the Var & the Esteron, the Nicoise region became a refuge and place of conspiracies for the French \u00e9migr\u00e9s: nobles, royal officers & priests who hoped to re-establish the royal family in France. \nA French army crossed the Var in September 1792 and freed the country from the Comte de Nice. Many of the inhabitants, who were secret Francophiles and partisans of the republic welcomed the return to France. This would be the beginning of a bloody confrontation with the Austro-Sardinian armies, which pillaged and caused havoc in many of the villages in the hills and valleys like Belv\u00e9d\u00e8re.\n\nIn The high valleys of the Gordolasque and the Vesubie, the most important battles unfolded, interrupted only by winter and the difficulties of communication. Belvedere was occupied, requisitioned, bombarded, taken and retaken by the French and Austro-Sards alternatively.\n\n''\u2026\u2026..in the case of Belvedere.  On 2 March 1793,[[Army of Italy (France)|General Brunet]] republican troops based in Saint-Julien, assaulted the village: \"the soldiers quickly climbed the escalad\u00e8rent terraces, planted with olive trees that made them immune artillery fire and musketry\"  the Sardinian troops were forced to retreat hastily to Saint-Blaise, Saint-Martin, the Col de fenestration and even Entracque.  With Belvedere, the whole valley V\u00e9subie who fell into the hands of Republicans.  The success only lasted 6 months.  In September 1793, the village suffered violent attacks from the Col de Raus; the redoubts of Saint-Julien, Vesca Del Cairo and Saint-Sauveur was the scene of fierce battles.  On September 8, Belvedere fell again, and it was not until April 1794, with the V\u00e9subie, the village was retaken\"''  <ref>Site officiel de l' Association MONT agne et Patrimoines ( AMONT )</ref>\n\nThe fall of [[Robespierre]] brought the fighting to an end in May 1794, but the comt\u00e9 de Nice was back in French hands. After the Austrians lost at Mondovi, which was fought on 21 April 1796 between the French army of Napoleon Bonaparte and the army of the Kingdom of Sardinia-Piedmont. The French won the battle and quickly forced King Victor Amadeus III to sue for peace.  The Sardinians capitulated and at the treaty of Turin on 15 May 1796, Savoy and the comt\u00e9 de Nice were returned to France. Belvedere was back in France.\n\n===Under the 1st Empire===\n The empire was accepted by Plebiscite. The Nice Arrondissement voted yes by 3,488 to 2 nos, while Puget Theniers had 2,818 yes to 3 no votes. The department was enriched by the addition of the arrondissement of San Remo ( Saorge, La Brigue, Perinaldo, Taggia, Ventimille and Bordighera)[[File:Bataille de Magenta.jpg|300px|left|thumb|The Battle of Magenta in 1859 led to the return of the Comte de Nice to France on condition of a favourable plebiscite]]In Belvedere the Raynardi family was en-nobled.

Capt in Regiment de Nice 1795, was created Baron of the Empire in 1810 and after the restoration created Marechal in 1816. \nThe peace that reigned there favoured peace and prosperity, but many of Belvederois men went to die on the battlefields of Europe\n\n===Return of the Sardinians===\nNapoleon was defeated in 1815, the Sardinians represented by Victor Emmanuel 1st restored the ancient regime. However, the republican experience had borne fruits. Everywhere voices were raised claiming more liberty and reattachment to France. Victor Emmanuel dreamed of a united Italy and appealed to Napoleon III. Too weak to take on Austria the King of Piedmont allied with France to declare war in 1859.[[File:Tramway sur le pont du Martinet \u00e0 Lantosque.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[:fr:Tramways des Alpes-Maritimes|The tramway from Plan du Var to Saint-Martin-Vesubie]], which ran from 1909 to 1929 and transformed access from Belvedere to the coast]]The Austrians were definitively beaten at Vaincue at [[Battle of Magenta|The Battle of Magenta]]  on 4 June 1859 during the Second Italian War of Independence, resulting in a French-Sardinian victory under Napoleon III against the Austrians under Marshal Ferencz Gyulai. The Franco-Piedmontese coalition consisted in overwhelming majority of French troops (1,100 Piedmontese and 58,000 French). Their victory can, therefore, be considered as mostly a French victory. The French wanted to obtain what the Belvederois and the other inhabitants of the comte de Nice and wished for so long.\n\n===The empire strikes back===\nBy the treaty of Turin on 24 March 1860 the King of Piedmont ceded to Napoleon III Savoy and the Comte de Nice on condition of a favourable plebiscite. On 15 April there was a triumphant result for France. Of 89 communes, 79 replied unanimously in 10 only where there some nos. On 14 June the Sardinian flag was replaced by the French. Belvedere retrieved its nationality, lost in 1713, found in 1794, lost again in 1815 and retrieved definitively in 1860. There was one shadow, which was not removed until victory in WWII. Several communes in the high vesubie remained an Italian enclave for another 87 years until 1947 as a hunting reserve for his majesty the king of Italy. There is no war, which does not leave sad souvenirs. The Communes of  Saint Sauveur, Isola, Rimplas, Valdeblore, Saint MartinVesubie and Belvedere were part of the Southern side of a remarkable line of frontier forts of 1860.  Belvedere had to accept the loss of territory of all of the north part of the Gordolasque valley from the Cascade du ray between the Cime de la Valette and the Celle du south Capelet. This territory was reserved for royal hunts until it was submitted by the Italians in 1947 and re-established under the title of the Commune of Belvedere.

On 10 April 1945 the [[:fr:1re division fran\u00e7aise libre|French 1st free French division]] (MFO) (BIMP), Pacific marine infantry battalion units and mechanized elements of the 1st Regiment fusiliers sailors, supported by artillery and aviation, launched an assault on German positions from the South. After a difficult fight, the Mille Fourches fort fell on 11 April, followed by Forca and Caval. Finally on the 12th, the redoubt of Three Communes was taken by a tank supported by five volunteer soldiers. At the end of a perilous ascent, Corporal C\u00e9saire Le Mercier, a Breton belonging to the 1st BIMP made it into the fort and emerged with 38 prisoners. The entire German front collapsed on 24 April 1945.\nHundreds of soldiers from both sides lost their lives in this battle (273 killed, wounded 644), one of the last on French territory. It allowed French troops to continue to Piedmont following the orders of General de Gaulle's who wished to occupy territory with a view to obtaining border changes in future peace negotiations. This French attitude led to tensions and hostilities with the American allies, who were keen to prevent the dismemberment of the Italian territories by vengeful victors. Belv\u00e9d\u00e8re was at one point evacuated and then reoccupied.\n\n===The definitive return to France===\nOn 19 February 1947 the \"Big Four\" victors signed a peace treaty with Italy finally exorcising the Fascist regime. The relevant Communes regained their territory. Tende and Brigue returned to France.

The sacred mountain, close to Nice, in the Alpes Maritimes and part of the [[Mercantour National Park]], currently being included in the UNESCO world heritage list.  For thousands of years, from the Stone Age all the way to the Iron Age, the first inhabitants of Europe were climbing all the way to the top of Mount Bego along the Canyons of the Valley of the Roya river starting from the Mediterranean Sea. They have recorded their early expressions of observing nature in more than thirty thousand graffiti on the stones of the [[Vall\u00e9e des Merveilles]]. The Belvederois remained an anonymous inhabitants of this part of Ligurie (Liguria) living on the fringes of the sacred mountain. There are some  vestiges of their ancient fortifications for example there is evidence of a part of a fort behind the church, which can be considered as the prehistoric beginnings of the actual village.[[File:\u041f\u043e\u0440\u0442\u0440\u0435\u0442 \u041a\u043e\u0440\u043d\u0435\u043b\u0438\u0438 \u0421\u0430\u043b\u043e\u043d\u0438\u043d\u044b.jpg|thumb|left|100px|Cornelia Salonina took the waters nearby.]]\n\n===The Gauls===\nIn 500 BC the Gauls infiltrated the Ligurian coast and arrived in the mountains around . The inhabitants of Massalia (Marseilles) founded colonies along the coast: Antibes, Monaco, Nice. Farmers spread inland raising vines and olives without however reducing the independence of the mountain dwellers\n\n===The Romans===\nThe Romans crossed the Alps Maritimes to secure a passage to Nice & Marseilles and to fight in Spain. In 125 BC they annexed the inland areas to found the Roman province of Provence followed by the Alpine regions as far as Tyrol. Belvedere was occupied and noble Romans of Cimez (Nice) who spent summers in Belvedere and developed the thermal baths at the nearby mountain village of [[:fr:Berthemont-les-Bains|Berthemont-les-Bains]].

The first of the Counts who would dominate the Region during the Middle Ages.]]In the 5th century the Germans finally overwhelmed the Western Roman Empire. They disputed Provence with the [[Visigoths]], then the [[Ostrogoths]] installed themselves, followed by the [[Lombards]] and finally the [[Franks|Francs]], who organised and  administered the region and repulsed the raiding [[Sassanid Empire|Sassanids]](Arabs) in the 7th & 8th centuries,whose attacks penetrating as far as the Vesubie.\n\n===Under the Counts of Provence===\nAt the dawn of the millennium Belvedere was part the kingdom of Burgundy.[[Rudolph II of Burgundy|Rudolf II]] (880-937), was ruler of Upper Burgundy (912\u2013937), Lower Burgundy (Provence) (933\u2013937) and also ruled Italy for nearly four years (923-926) during the chaotic period at the end of the [[Carolingian dynasty|Carolingian]] era. However, in 926 the Italian nobility turned against him and requested that [[Hugh of Italy|Hugh of Arles]],Comte d'Arles, the effective ruler of Provence (or Lower Burgundy), rule them instead. Rudolf returned to Upper Burgundy to protect himself, assuring Hugh's coronation as King of Italy in the process. The Counts would dominate the region until 1388, effectively for the duration of  the Middle Ages. It was the feudal era with a lord or Seigneur for each village, but most areas maintained their autonomy and Luceram, Utelle and Saint Martin Vesubie, like Belvedere, administered themselves. After the death of Queen Jeanne (1382), Amadeus VII Count of Savoy, Aosta and Maurienne, the Red Earl, taking advantage of the subsequent war of succession in Provence negotiated the succession of Nice to Savoy with Baron Jean Grimaldi Bueil, who was seneschal of Provence and commander of the garrison defending Nice. Ruined by war, the inhabitants of Nice and the countries aligned themselves with the policy of John Grimaldi and accepted the protection of the House of Savoy through the Treaty of Saint Pons, known as the Revocation of Nice to Savoy.[[File:Western Europe Utrecht Treaty.jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Western Europe|Western Europe's]] borders after the Treaties of Utrecht, which took Bevedere into the Kingdom of Sardinia.]]\n\n===The Princes of Savoy===\nThe Princes of Savoy were French by race and language and Belvedere remained a French village. But for the majority of the period from 1388 until 1713 the successors of the Red Earl, Amedee VII, successively allied themselves with enemies of France. As a result, the \"Pays Nicois\" was crossed by hostile armies and subjected to incessant devastation, particularly following the battles between Charles V and Francis 1st (1494\u20131547) .\nThis unhappy  situation continued off and on until after the war of Spanish Succession when  at the Treaty of Utrecht (1713)  Louis XIV of France and Philip V of Spain on the one hand met representatives of Queen Anne of Great Britain, the Duke of Savoy, and the United Provinces on the other and divided up Spain's European empire. Savoy received Sicily and parts of the Duchy of Milan, while Charles VI (the Holy Roman Emperor and Archduke of Austria, received the Spanish Netherlands, the Kingdom of Naples, Sardinia, and the bulk of the Duchy of Milan. \nThen in 1723, or in 1720 according to the international law the crown of Sardinia was awarded by the Treaty of The Hague to King Victor Amadeus II of Savoy to compensate him for the loss of the crown of Sicily to Austria, enabling him to retain the title of king. Besides Sardinia, the new kingdom with its capital in Turin included Savoy, Piedmont, and Nice with the result that Belvedere from now on was part of the Kingdom of Sardinia which included Savoy, Piedmont, the Comte de Nice and Sardinia and thus it remained until 1860.\n\n===Under the Sardinian Regime===\nDuring this period Belvedere lived under a foreign flag: however the Pays Nicois benefited from the general peace and progress. The beautiful countryside, mild climate and verdant agriculture, attracted, all along the coast, rich residents which benefited many of the villages. Cultural life developed, but villages like Belvedere stayed isolated and life remained primitive without passable roads or commerce. Belvedere, like its neighbours, retreated into itself and in effect formed a little independent republic. The French Revolution of 1789 brought a disruption, which the people supported without getting any benefits from it.\n\n===The Revolution and a return to France===\nSituated just over the frontier of France, from which it was separated  by the Var & the Esteron, the Nicoise region became a refuge and place of conspiracies for the French \u00e9migr\u00e9s: nobles, royal officers & priests who hoped to re-establish the royal family in France. \nA French army crossed the Var in September 1792 and freed the country from the Comte de Nice. Many of the inhabitants, who were secret Francophiles and partisans of the republic welcomed the return to France. This would be the beginning of a bloody confrontation with the Austro-Sardinian armies, which pillaged and caused havoc in many of the villages in the hills and valleys like Belv\u00e9d\u00e8re.\n\nIn The high valleys of the Gordolasque and the Vesubie, the most important battles unfolded, interrupted only by winter and the difficulties of communication. Belvedere was occupied, requisitioned, bombarded, taken and retaken by the French and Austro-Sards alternatively.\n\n''\u2026\u2026..in the case of Belvedere.  On 2 March 1793,[[Army of Italy (France)|General Brunet]] republican troops based in Saint-Julien, assaulted the village: \"the soldiers quickly climbed the escalad\u00e8rent terraces, planted with olive trees that made them immune artillery fire and musketry\"  the Sardinian troops were forced to retreat hastily to Saint-Blaise, Saint-Martin, the Col de fenestration and even Entracque.  With Belvedere, the whole valley V\u00e9subie who fell into the hands of Republicans.  The success only lasted 6 months.  In September 1793, the village suffered violent attacks from the Col de Raus; the redoubts of Saint-Julien, Vesca Del Cairo and Saint-Sauveur was the scene of fierce battles.  On September 8, Belvedere fell again, and it was not until April 1794, with the V\u00e9subie, the village was retaken\"''  <ref>Site officiel de l' Association MONT agne et Patrimoines ( AMONT )</ref>\n\nThe fall of [[Robespierre]] brought the fighting to an end in May 1794, but the comt\u00e9 de Nice was back in French hands. After the Austrians lost at Mondovi, which was fought on 21 April 1796 between the French army of Napoleon Bonaparte and the army of the Kingdom of Sardinia-Piedmont. The French won the battle and quickly forced King Victor Amadeus III to sue for peace.  The Sardinians capitulated and at the treaty of Turin on 15 May 1796, Savoy and the comt\u00e9 de Nice were returned to France. Belvedere was back in France.\n\n===Under the 1st Empire===\n The empire was accepted by Plebiscite. The Nice Arrondissement voted yes by 3,488 to 2 nos, while Puget Theniers had 2,818 yes to 3 no votes. The department was enriched by the addition of the arrondissement of San Remo ( Saorge, La Brigue, Perinaldo, Taggia, Ventimille and Bordighera)[[File:Bataille de Magenta.jpg|300px|left|thumb|The Battle of Magenta in 1859 led to the return of the Comte de Nice to France on condition of a favourable plebiscite]]In Belvedere the Raynardi family was en-nobled.

However the republican experience had borne fruits. Everywhere voices were raised claiming more liberty and reattachment to France. Victor Emmanuel dreamed of a united Italy and appealed to Napoleon III. Too weak to take on Austria the King of Piedmont allied with France to declare war in 1859.[[File:Tramway sur le pont du Martinet \u00e0 Lantosque.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[:fr:Tramways des Alpes-Maritimes|The tramway from Plan du Var to Saint-Martin-Vesubie]], which ran from 1909 to 1929 and transformed access from Belvedere to the coast]]The Austrians were definitively beaten at Vaincue at [[Battle of Magenta|The Battle of Magenta]]  on 4 June 1859 during the Second Italian War of Independence, resulting in a French-Sardinian victory under Napoleon III against the Austrians under Marshal Ferencz Gyulai. The Franco-Piedmontese coalition consisted in overwhelming majority of French troops (1100 Piedmontese and 58.000 French). Their victory can therefore be considered as mostly a French victory.The French wanted to obtain what the Belvederois and the other inhabitants of the comte de Nice and wished for so long.\n\n===The empire strikes back===\nBy the treaty of Turin on 24 March 1860 the King of Piedmont ceded to Napoleon III Savoy and the Comte de Nice on condition of a favourable plebiscite. On 15 April there was a triumphant result for France. Of 89 communes, 79 replied unanimously in 10 only where there some nos. On 14 June the Sardinian flag was replaced by the French. Belvedere retrieved its nationality, lost in 1713, found in 1794, lost again in 1815 and retrieved definitively in 1860. There was one shadow, which was not removed until victory in WWII. Several communes in the high vesubie remained an Italian enclave for another 87 years until 1947 as a hunting reserve for his majesty the king of ItalyThere is no war, which does not leave sad souvenirs. The Communes of  Saint Sauveur, Isola, Rimplas, Valdeblore, Saint MartinVesubie and Belvedere were part of the Southern side of a remarkable line of frontier forts of 1860.  Belvedere had to accept the loss of territory of all of the north part of the Gordolasque valley from the Cascade du ray between the Cime de la Valette and the Celle du south Capelet. This territory was reserved for royal hunts until it was submitted by the Italians in 1947 and re-established under the title of the Commune of Belvedere.

Their occupation only was terminated by the final defeat of the German army.[[File:Old tank at authion.JPG|right|thumb|300px|Remnants of war still in evidence over 50 years after the battle on [[:fr:Massif de l'Authion|the Massif de l'Authion]] above Belv\u00e9d\u00e8re]] In the spring of 1945 the Authion massif above Belv\u00e9d\u00e8re was occupied by the [[:fr:34e division d'infanterie (Allemagne)|34th DI]] and troops of German mountain brigade in a network of fortifications: Forca (2078 m), Three Communes redoubt (2080 m),  Plan Caval (1932 m) and fort Mille Fourches (2042 m). On 10 April 1945 the [[:fr:1re division fran\u00e7aise libre|French 1st free French division]] (MFO) (BIMP), Pacific marine infantry battalion units and mechanized elements of the 1st Regiment fusiliers sailors, supported by artillery and aviation, launched an assault on German positions from the South. After a difficult fight the Mille Fourches fort fell on 11 April, followed by Forca and Caval. Finally on the 12th, the redoubt of Three Communes was taken by a tank supported by five volunteer soldiers. At the end of a perilous ascent, Corporal C\u00e9saire Le Mercier, a Breton belonging to the 1st BIMP made it into the fort and emerged with 38 prisoners. The entire German front collapsed on 24 April 1945.\nHundreds of soldiers from both sides lost their lives in this battle (273 killed, wounded 644), one of the last on French territory. It allowed French troops to continue to Piedmont following the orders of General de Gaulle's who wished to occupy territory with a view to obtaining border changes in future peace negotiations. This French attitude led to tensions and hostilities with the American allies, who were keen to prevent the dismemberment of the Italian territories by vengeful victors. Belv\u00e9d\u00e8re was at one point evacuated and then reoccupied.\n\n===The definitive return to France===\nOn 19 February 1947 the \"Big Four\" victors signed a peace treaty with Italy finally exorcising the Fascist regime.

Korean cuisine has evolved through centuries of social and political change. Originating from ancient [[Prehistoric Korea|agricultural and nomadic traditions]] in Korea and southern [[Manchuria]], Korean cuisine has evolved through a complex interaction of the natural environment and different cultural trends.<ref name=\"han-style.com\"/><ref name=\"Korean Cuisine\">{{cite web|url=http://100.naver.com/100.nhn?docid=186015 |title=Korean Cuisine (\ud55c\uad6d\uc694\ub9ac \u97d3\u570b\u6599\u7406)|publisher=[[Naver]] / [[Doosan Encyclopedia]]|language=Korean|accessdate=2009-03-28}}</ref>\n\nKorean cuisine is largely based on [[rice]], [[vegetable]]s, and (at least in the South) [[meat]]s. Traditional Korean meals are named for the number of [[side dish]]es (\ubc18\ucc2c; \u98ef\u994c; ''[[banchan]]'') that accompany [[steaming|steam-cooked]] short-grain rice. [[Kimchi]] is served at nearly every meal. Commonly used ingredients include [[sesame oil]], ''[[doenjang]]'' ([[fermented bean paste]]), [[Korean soy sauce|soy sauce]], salt, garlic, ginger, ''[[gochukaru|gochutgaru]]'' ([[chili pepper|pepper]] flakes), ''[[gochujang]]'' (fermented red chili paste) and [[napa cabbage]].\n\nIngredients and dishes vary by province. Many regional dishes have become national, and dishes that were once regional have proliferated in different variations across the country. [[Korean royal court cuisine]] once brought all of the unique regional specialties together for the royal family. Foods are regulated by Korean cultural [[etiquette]].\n\n==Food==\n===Grains===\n[[File:Korea-Icheon-Dolsotbap-Cooked rice in a stone pot-01.jpg|thumb|alt=Cooked rice sprinkled with four pieces of dried grape and cooked three chestnut in a black stone pot|''Dolsotbap'', cooked rice in a stone pot (''[[dolsot]]'')]][[Grain]]s have been one of the most important staples of the Korean diet. Early myths of the foundations of various kingdoms in Korea center on grains. One foundation myth relates to [[Jumong]], who received [[barley]] seeds from two [[dove]]s sent by his mother after establishing the kingdom of [[Goguryeo]].<ref>Yi Kyubo, 1-9.</ref> Yet another myth speaks of the three founding deities of [[Jeju-do|Jeju Island]], who were to be wed to the three princesses of [[Tamna]]; the deities brought seeds of five grains which were the first seeds planted, which in turn became the first instance of farming.<ref>Kory\u01d2sa, 57, 53b-54b.</ref>\n\nDuring the pre-modern era, grains such as barley and millet were the main staples. They were supplemented by wheat, [[sorghum]], and [[buckwheat]]. Rice is not an indigenous crop to Korea and millet was likely the preferred grain before rice was cultivated. Rice became the grain of choice during the Three Kingdoms period, particularly in the [[Silla]] and [[Baekje]] Kingdoms in the southern regions of the peninsula. Rice was such an important commodity in Silla that it was used to pay taxes. The [[Sino-Korean vocabulary|Sino-Korean]] word for \"tax\" is a compound character that uses the character for the rice plant. The preference for rice escalated into the [[Joseon period]], when new methods of cultivation and new varieties emerged that would help increase production.<ref name=\"Pettid3\">Pettid, 33.</ref>\n\nAs rice was prohibitively expensive when it first came to Korea, the grain was likely mixed with other grains to \"stretch\" the rice; this is still done in dishes such as ''boribap'' (rice with barley) and ''[[kongbap]]'' (rice with beans).<ref name=\"Joins\">{{cite news |url=http://article.joins.com/article/article.asp?total_id=2685876 |title=The reason why kongbap changed to boribap (\ucf69\uc0ac\uc5f0) |newspaper=[[JoongAng Ilbo]] |author=Yu Ji-sang (\uc720\uc9c0\uc0c1) |language=Korean |accessdate=2009-03-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090126133718/http://article.joins.com/article/article.asp?total_id=2685876 |archivedate=2009-01-26 }}</ref> White rice, which is rice with the bran removed, has been the preferred form of rice since its introduction into the cuisine. The most traditional method of cooking the rice has been to cook it in an iron pot called a ''sot'' (\uc1a5) or ''musoe sot'' (\ubb34\uc1e0\uc1a5). This method of rice cookery dates back to at least the [[Goryeo period]], and these pots have even been found in tombs from the Silla period. The ''sot'' is still used today, much in the same manner as it was in the past centuries.<ref name=\"Pettid4\">Pettid, 34.</ref>\n\nRice is used to make a number of items, outside of the traditional bowl of plain white rice. It is commonly ground into a flour and used to make rice cakes called ''[[tteok]]'' in over two hundred varieties. It is also cooked down into a [[congee]] (''juk'') or [[gruel]] (''mieum'') and mixed with other grains, meat, or seafood.

A porridge made with azuki beans, called ''[[patjuk]]'', is commonly eaten during the winter season. On [[Dongzhi Festival|Dongjinal]], a Korean traditional holiday which falls on December 22, Korean people eat ''donji patjuk'', which contains ''saealsim'' (\uc0c8\uc54c\uc2ec), a ball made from glutinous rice flour.

Fermented condiments include ''[[ganjang]]'', ''[[doenjang]]'', ''[[gochujang]]'' and vinegars. Nonfermented condiments or spices include red pepper, black pepper, cordifolia, mustard, chinensis, garlic, onion, ginger, leek, and scallion (spring onion).<ref>Shin, Dong Hwa \"Korean Traditional Food: Status, Prospects, and Vision for Globalization\" Chonbuk National University, 2004</ref>\n\n===Gochujang===\n[[Gochujang]] can be found in many writings. Some of the writings are the ''Mankiyoram'', ''The Three States'', the ''Nonggawolryeongga'', the ''Gijaejapgi'', and the ''Hyangyak-jipsongbang''. The ''Hyangyak-jipsongbang'', which dates back to around 1433 during the Chosun Dynasty, is one of the oldest writings mentioning gochujang.\n\nGochujang is a fermented bean paste that has red pepper powder, soybean powder and rice flour added to it to create a spicy paste. It typically can be added to most dishes. Gochujang can be used as a seasoning and sometimes as a dipping sauce.\n\nMany variations come from ''jang'', fermented bean paste. Some variations can include [[doenjang]] (soybean and brine), [[kanjang]] (soybeans, water, and salt), [[chogochujang]] (gochujang and vinegar), and [[jeotgal]] (mixture of other jangs and seafoods).\n\nVegetables such as cucumbers, carrots, and cabbage use gochujang as a dip. Gochujang is a common seasoning for foods such as Korean barbecue including pork and beef. One popular snack food that is very commonly eaten with gochujang is bibimbap. [[Bibimbap]] includes rice, spinach, radish, bean sprouts. Sometimes beef is added to bibimbap. Another popular dish including gochujang is [[tteokbokki]].\n\nGochujang was used to revitalize people who were sick with colds or exhaustion during the Chosun Period. There have been some studies that show that red peppers fight obesity and diabetes. Gochujang is also added to many foods so that there can be additional nutritional value with each meal.<ref>Kim, S., Chung, K. R., Yang, H., & Kwon, D. Y.

Ancient records indicate rearing of [[livestock]] began on a small scale during the Three Kingdoms period. Meat was consumed roasted or in soups or stews during this period. Those who lived closer to the oceans were able to complement their diet with more fish, while those who lived in the interior had a diet containing more meat.<ref>Pettid, 58.</ref>\n\n====Beef====\n[[File:Korean barbeque-Yangnyeom galbi-01.jpg|thumb|Marinated [[galbi]] before grilling'']]\n[[Beef]] is the most prized of all, with the cattle holding an important cultural role in the Korean home. Beef is prepared in numerous ways today, including roasting, grilling (''[[Gui (food)|gui]]'') or boiling in [[guk|soups]]. Beef can also be dried into ''[[yukpo]]'', a type of ''[[po (food)|po]]'', as with seafood, called ''[[eopo]]''.<ref>Pettid, 60.</ref>\n\nThe cattle were valuable draught animals, often seen as equal to human servants, or in some cases, members of the family. Cattle were also given their own holiday during the first 'cow' day of the [[Korean New Year|lunar New Year]]. The importance of cattle does not suggest Koreans ate an abundance of beef, however, as the cattle were valued as [[Pack animal|beasts of burden]] and slaughtering one would create dire issues in farming the land. Pork and seafood were consumed more regularly for this reason. The Buddhist ruling class of the Goryeo period forbade the consumption of beef. The [[Mongol]]s dispensed with the ban of beef during the 13th century, and they promoted the production of beef cattle. This increased production continued into the Joseon period, when the government encouraged both increased quantities and quality of beef.<ref>Pettid, 59-60.</ref> Only in the latter part of the 20th century has beef become regular table fare.\n\n====Chicken====\n[[Chicken (food)|Chicken]] has played an important role as a protein in Korean history, evidenced by a number of myths. One myth tells of the birth of [[Kim Alji]], founder of the [[Kim (Korean name)#Gyeongju|Kim family]] of [[Gyeongju]] being announced by the cry of a white chicken. As the birth of a clan's founder is always announced by an animal with preternatural qualities, this myth speaks to the importance of chicken in Korean culture. Chicken is often served roasted or braised with vegetables or in soups. All parts of the chicken are used in Korean cuisine, including the [[gizzard]], [[liver]], and feet. Young chickens are braised with [[ginseng]] and other ingredients in medicinal soups eaten during the summer months to combat heat called ''[[samgyetang]]''. The feet of the chicken, called ''dakbal'' (\ub2ed\ubc1c), are often roasted and covered with hot and spicy ''[[gochujang]]''-based sauce and served as an ''[[anju (food)|anju]]'', or side dish, to accompany [[Korean alcoholic beverages|alcoholic beverages]], especially ''[[soju]]''.<ref name=\"Pettid, 62\"/><ref>Yu Jisang (\uc720\uc9c0\uc0c1)</ref>\n\n====Pork====\n[[File:Korean barbeque-Samgyeopsal-06.jpg|thumb|''[[Samgyeopsal]]'']]\n[[Pork]] has also been another important land-based protein for Korea. Records indicate pork has been a part of the Korean diet back to antiquity, similar to beef.<ref>Pettid, 61.</ref>\n\nA number of foods have been avoided while eating pork, including [[Chinese bellflower]] (''doraji'', \ub3c4\ub77c\uc9c0) and [[lotus root]] (''yeonn ppuri'', \uc5f0\ubfcc\ub9ac), as the combinations have been thought to cause diarrhea. All parts of the pig are used in Korean cuisine, including the head, intestines, liver, kidney and other internal organs. Koreans utilize these parts in a variety of cooking methods including steaming, stewing, boiling and smoking.<ref name=\"Pettid, 62\">Pettid, 62.</ref> Koreans especially like to eat grilled pork belly, which is called ''[[samgyeopsal]]'' (\uc0bc\uacb9\uc0b4, \u4e09--).<ref name=\"Pettid, 62\" />\n\n====Fish and seafood====\n{{see also|List of Korean dishes#Fish-based dishes|Jeotgal}}\n[[File:Korean.cuisine-Ganjang gejang and banchan-01.jpg|thumb|A bowl of ''[[gejang]]'', marinated crabs in soy sauce and plates of various ''[[banchan]]'' (small side dishes)]]\n[[Fish (food)|Fish]] and [[shellfish]] have been a major part of Korean cuisine because of the oceans bordering the peninsula. Evidence from the 12th century illustrates commoners consumed a diet mostly of fish and shellfish, such as [[Shrimp (food)|shrimp]], [[clam]]s, [[oyster]]s, [[abalone]], and [[Cobitidae|loach]], while [[sheep]] and hogs were reserved for the upper class.<ref name=\"Pettid5\">Pettid, 63.</ref>\n\nBoth fresh and saltwater fish are popular, and are served raw, grilled, broiled, dried or served in soups and stews. Common grilled fish include [[Mackerel (food)|mackerel]], [[hairtail]], [[Sciaenidae|croaker]] and [[Pacific herring]]. Smaller fish, shrimp, squid, mollusks and countless other seafood can be salted and fermented as ''[[jeotgal]]''. Fish can also be grilled either whole or in fillets as [[banchan]]. Fish is often dried naturally to prolong storing periods and enable shipping over long distances. Fish commonly dried include [[yellow corvina]], [[Anchovy (food)|anchovies]] (''myeolchi'') and [[Sciaenidae|croaker]].<ref name=\"Pettid5\"/> Dried anchovies, along with kelp, form the basis of common soup stocks.<ref>Marks, 8.</ref>\n\nShellfish is widely eaten in all different types of preparation.

The main dishes are made from grains such as ''bap'' (a bowl of rice), ''[[Rice congee|juk]]'' (porridge), and ''[[Korean noodles|guksu]]'' (noodles).\n\nMany Korean ''banchan'' rely on fermentation for flavor and preservation, resulting in a tangy, salty, and spicy taste. Certain regions are especially associated with some dishes (for example, the city of [[Jeonju]] with ''[[bibimbap]]'') either as a place of origin or for a famous regional variety. Restaurants will often use these famous names on their signs or menus (i.e. \"[[Suwon]] galbi\").\n\n===Soups and stews===\n{{see also|List of Korean dishes#Soups and stews}}\n[[File:Korean.food-Tteok.mandu.guk-01.jpg|thumb|''[[Tteokguk]]'', soup made with ''[[tteok]]'', rice cake]]\n[[Soup]]s are a common part of any Korean meal. Unlike other cultures, in Korean culture, soup is served as part of the main course rather than at the beginning or the end of the meal, as an accompaniment to rice along with other [[banchan]]. Soups known as ''[[guk]]'' are often made with meats, shellfish and vegetables. Soups can be made into more formal soups known as ''[[tang (food)|tang]]'', often served as the main dish of the meal. ''[[Jjigae]]'' are a thicker, heavier seasoned soups or stews.<ref>Pettid, 56.</ref>\n\nSome popular types of soups are:\n* ''[[Malgeunguk]]'' (\ub9d1\uc740\uad6d), are flavored with ''[[ganjang]]''.

Some versions of this soup may also use the beef head and intestines. The only seasoning generally used in the soup is salt.\n* ''[[Naengguk]]'' (\ub0c9\uad6d), which are cold soups generally eaten during the summer months to cool the diner. A light hand is usually used in the seasoning of these soups usually using ''[[ganjang]]'' and [[sesame oil]].<ref>Pettid, 57.</ref>\n*Shin-Son-Ro (or Koo-Ja Tang), the name of it came from its special cook pot with chimney for burning charcoal.

The top-selling domestic beers (the Korean term for beer being ''maekju'') are [[lager]]s, which differ from Western beers in that they are brewed from rice, rather than barley. Consequently, Korean beers are lighter, sweeter and have less head than their Western counterparts. The [[South Korean beer]] market is dominated by the two major breweries: [[Hite Brewery|Hite]] and [[Oriental Brewery|OB]].

''[[Dasik]]'', literally \"eatery for tea\", is made by kneading rice flour, honey, and various types of flour from nuts, herbs, sesame, or jujubes. ''[[Jeonggwa]]'', or ''jeongwa'', is made by boiling fruits, plant roots and seeds in honey, [[yeot|mullyeot]] (''\ubb3c\uc5ff'', liquid candy) or sugar.

Each person was given a table in traditional dining setting.]]\n[[File:Korean chopsticks and spoon-Sujeo-01.jpg|thumb|160px|Korean [[chopsticks]] and [[spoon]] made of [[stainless steel]].]]\nDining etiquette in Korea can be traced back to the [[Confucian]] philosophies of the Joseon period. Guidebooks, such as ''[[Sasojeol]]'' (\u58eb\u5c0f\u7bc0, ''Elementary Etiquette for Scholar Families''), written in 1775 by Yi Deokmu (\uc774\ub355\ubb34; \u674e\u5fb7\u61cb), comment on the dining etiquette for the period. Suggestions include items such as \"when you see a fat cow, goat, pig, or chicken, do not immediately speak of slaughtering, cooking or eating it\",<ref name=\"Quote1\">Yi T\u01d2ngmu 62.</ref> \"when you are having a meal with others, do not speak of smelly or dirty things, such as boils or [[diarrhea]],\"<ref name=\"Quote1\"/>  \"when eating a meal, neither eat so slowly as to appear to be eating against your will nor so fast as if to be taking someone else's food. Do not throw chopsticks on the table. Spoons should not touch plates, making a clashing sound\",<ref name=\"Quote1\"/> among many other recommendations which emphasized proper [[table etiquette]].\n\nOther than the etiquette mentioned above, blowing one's nose when having a meal is considered an inappropriate act as well. Such act should be avoided.\n\nThe eldest male at the table was always served first, and was commonly served in the men's quarters by the women of the house.  Women usually dined in a separate portion of the house after the men were served. The eldest men or women always ate before the younger family members. The meal was usually quiet, as conversation was discouraged during meals. In modern times, these rules have become lax, as families usually dine together now and use the time to converse. Of the remaining elements of this decorum, one is that the younger members of the table should not pick up their [[chopsticks]] or start eating before the elders of the table or guests and should not finish eating before the elders or guests finish eating.<ref name=\"etiquette1\">Pettid, 159.</ref><ref name=\"Jang et al. 2005, p.102\">Jang et al. (2005, p.102).</ref>\n\nIn Korea, unlike in other East Asian cuisines such as [[Chinese cuisine|Chinese]] and [[Japanese cuisine|Japanese]], the rice or soup bowl is not lifted from the table when eating from it. This is due to the fact that each diner is given a metal spoon along with the chopsticks known collectively as [[sujeo]]. The use of the spoon for eating rice and soups is expected. There are rules which reflect the decorum of sharing communal side dishes; rules include not picking through the dishes for certain items while leaving others, and the spoon used should be clean, because usually diners put their spoons in the same serving bowl on the table. Diners should also cover their mouths when using a [[toothpick]] after the meal.<ref name=\"etiquette1\"/><ref name=\"Jang et al. 2005, p.102\"/>\n\nThe table setup is important as well, and individual place settings, moving from the diner's left should be as follows: rice bowl, spoon, then chopsticks. Hot foods are set to the right side of the table, with the cold foods to the left. Soup must remain on the right side of the diner along with [[stew]]s. Vegetables remain on the left along with the rice, and [[kimchi]] is set to the back while sauces remain in the front.<ref name=\"etiquette1\"/>\n\n===Drinking===\nThe manner of drinking [[Soju|alcoholic drinks]] while dining is significant in [[Drinking culture of Korea|Korean dining etiquette]]. Each diner is expected to face away from the [[Korean Confucianism|eldest male]] and cover his mouth when drinking alcohol.\nAccording to Hyang Eum Ju Rye (\ud5a5\uc74c\uc8fc\ub840; \u9115\u98ee\u9152\u79ae), the drinking etiquette established in [[Choseon Dynasty]], it is impolite for a king and his vassal, a father and his son, or a teacher and his student to drink face to face. Also, a guest should not refuse the first drink offered by host, and in the most formal situations, the diner should politely twice refuse a drink offered by the eldest male or a host. When the host offers for the third time, then finally the guest can receive it. If the guest refuses three times, drink is not to be offered any more.<ref>Jeong, H. (2011).

During the Mumun period, people grew millet, barley, wheat, legumes and rice, and continued to hunt and fish. Archaeological remains point to development of fermented beans during this period, and cultural contact with nomadic cultures to the north facilitated domestication of animals.\n\n===Three Kingdoms period===\n[[File:Goguryeo-Gakjeochong-Inner life.jpg|thumb|In a mural of ''[[Gakjeochong]]'' (\uac01\uc800\ucd1d \"Tombs of [[Ssireum|Wrestlers]]\"),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.koreanculture.org/06about_korea/symbols/24ssireum.htm |title=Ssireum |publisher=Korean Overseas Information Service |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081221142538/http://www.koreanculture.org/06about_korea/symbols/24ssireum.htm |archivedate=2008-12-21 }}</ref> a [[Goguryeo]] tomb built around the 5th century shows a Goguryeo nobleman having a meal with two ladies.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://100.nate.com/dicsearch/pimage.html?s=&i=244844002&en=244844&p_i=&a_i=&e=1 |title=Gakjeochong (\uac01\uc800\ucd1d \u89d2\u62b5\u585a) |publisher=[[Nate (web portal)|Nate]] /[[EncyKorea]] |language=Korean |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110610052233/http://100.nate.com/dicsearch/pimage.html?s=&i=244844002&en=244844&p_i=&a_i=&e=1 |archivedate=2011-06-10 }}</ref>]]\n\nThe [[Three Kingdoms of Korea|Three Kingdoms]] period (57 BCE&nbsp;\u2013 668 CE) was one of rapid cultural evolution. The kingdom of [[Goguryeo]] (37 BCE&nbsp;\u2013 668 CE) was located in the northern part of the peninsula along much of modern-day [[Manchuria]]. The second kingdom, [[Baekje]] (18 BCE&nbsp;\u2013 660 CE), was in the southwestern portion of the peninsula, and the third, [[Silla]] (57 BCE&nbsp;\u2013 935 CE), was located at the southeastern portion of the peninsula. Each region had its own distinct set of cultural practices and foods. For example, Baekje was known for cold foods and fermented foods like ''[[kimchi]]''. The spread of [[Buddhism]] and [[Confucianism]] through cultural exchanges with China during the fourth century CE began to change the distinct cultures of Korea.<ref name=\"Pettid1\">Pettid, 13.</ref>\n\n===Goryeo period===\n[[File:Spoon of Injong.jpg|thumb|right|220px| [[Silver]] [[spoon]] and [[chopsticks]] entombed with [[Injong of Goryeo|King Injong]] in 1146]]\nDuring the latter Goryeo period, the [[Mongols]] invaded Goryeo in the 13th century. Some traditional foods found today in Korea have their origins during this period. The dumpling dish, ''[[mandu (food)|mandu]]'', grilled meat dishes, [[Korean noodles|noodle dishes]], and the use of seasonings such as black pepper, all have their roots in this period.<ref>{{Harvnb|Pettid|2008}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=wzJ7_WcLJSwC&pg=PA15&hl=en#v=onepage&q&f=false p.15]</ref>\n\n===Joseon period===\nAgricultural innovations were significant and widespread during this period, such as the invention of the rain gauge during the 15th century. During 1429, the government began publishing books on agriculture and farming techniques, which included ''[[Nongsa jikseol]]'' (literally \"Straight Talk on Farming\"), an agricultural book compiled under [[King Sejong]].<ref name=\"National Assembly\">King Sejong's Humanism, from [[National Assembly of the Republic of Korea]]</ref><ref>Pettid, 17.</ref><ref>[[The Academy of Korean Studies]]\n</ref>\n\nA series of invasions in the earlier half of the Joseon caused a dynamic shift in the culture during the second half of the period. Groups of ''[[silhak]]'' (\"practical learning\") scholars began to emphasize the importance of looking outside the country for innovation and technology to help improve the agricultural systems. Crops traded by Europeans from the [[New World]] began to appear, acquired through trade with China, Japan, Europe, and the [[Philippines]]; these crops included corn, sweet potatoes, chili peppers, tomatoes, peanuts, and [[Squash (plant)|squash]]. Potatoes and sweet potatoes were particularly favored as they grew in soils and on terrains that were previously unused.<ref>Pettid, 18-19.</ref>\n\nGovernment further developed agriculture through technology and lower taxation. Complex [[irrigation system]]s built by government allowed peasant farmers to produce larger crop volumes and produce crops not only for sustenance but also as [[cash crop]]s. Reduced taxation of the peasantry also furthered the expanded commerce through increasing periodic markets, usually held every five days. One thousand such markets existed in the 19th century, and were communal centers for economic trade and entertainment.<ref>Pettid, 18.</ref>\n\nThe end of the Joseon period was marked by consistent encouragement to trade with the Western world, China and Japan. In the 1860s, trade agreements pushed by the Japanese government led the [[Joseon Dynasty]] to open its trade ports with the west, and to numerous treaties with the United States, Britain, France, and other Western countries.<ref>Pettid, 19.</ref>\n\nThe opening of Korea to the Western world brought further exchange of culture and food. Western missionaries introduced new ingredients and dishes to Korea. Joseon elites were introduced to these new foods by way of foreigners who attended the royal court as advisers or physicians. This period also saw the introduction of various seasonings imported from Japan via western traders and alcoholic drinks from China.<ref>Pettid, 163.</ref>\n\n===Colonial period to Modern period===\n[[File:Korean.food-Budaejjigae-01.jpg|thumb|alt=A spicy stew in a pot|''[[Budae jjigae]]'', a spicy stew originated during the Korean War.]]\n[[File:Korean chicken dish in Sydney, Australia.JPG|thumb|Korean chicken dish (Jjimdak) in Sydney, Australia]]\n\nJapan colonized [[Korean peninsula]] from 1910 to 1945. Many of the agricultural systems were taken over by the Japanese to support Japan's food supply. Land changes resulting from the Japanese occupation included combining small farms into large-scale farms, which led to larger yields. Rice production increased during this period to support the Japanese Empire's war efforts. Many Koreans, in turn, increased the production of other grains for their own consumption.<ref name=\"Pettid2\">Pettid, 19-20.</ref>\n\nMeals during the Japanese occupation were quite varied. Koreans usually ate two meals a day during the cold seasons, and three during the warm seasons. For the lower classes, satiety, rather than quality, was most important. Those in even lower economic levels were likely to enjoy only a single bowl of white rice ''each year'', while the remainder of the year was filled with cheaper grains, such as [[millet]] and [[barley]].<ref>Pettid, 29,163.</ref> For the Korean middle and upper classes during the occupation, things were quite different. Western foods began emerging in the Korean diet, such as white bread and commercially produced staples such as precooked noodles. The Japanese occupational period ended after the defeat of Japan during [[World War II]].<ref>Pettid, 20.</ref>\n\nThe country remained in a state of turmoil through the [[Korean War]] (1950\u20131953) and the [[Cold War]], which separated the country into [[North Korea]] and [[South Korea]]. Both of these periods continued the limited food provisions for Koreans,<ref name=\"Pettid2\"/> and the stew called ''[[budae jjigae]]'', which makes use of inexpensive meats such as sausage and [[Spam (food)|Spam]], originated during this period.\n\n[[File:Koreatown NY Food.JPG|thumb|Korean restaurant dishes in Koreatown, New York City]]\n\nAt this point, the history of North and South Korea sharply diverged.  In the 1960s under President [[Park Chung-hee]], industrialization began to give South Korea the economic and cultural power it holds in the global economy today. Agriculture was increased through use of commercial fertilizers and modern farming equipment. In the 1970s, food shortages began to lessen. Consumption of instant and processed foods increased, as did the overall quality of foods. [[Livestock]] and dairy production was increased during the 1970s through the increase of commercial dairies and mechanized farms.<ref>Pettid, 164-165.</ref> The consumption of pork and beef increased vastly in the 1970s. Per-capita consumption of meat was 3.6&nbsp;kg in 1961 and 11&nbsp;kg by 1979. The result of this increased meat consumption brought about the rise of ''[[bulgogi]]'' restaurants, which gave the middle class of South Korea the ability to enjoy meat regularly. Meat eating continued to rise, reaching 40&nbsp;kg in 1997, with fish consumption at 49.5&nbsp;kg in 1998. Rice consumption continually decreased through these years, with 128&nbsp;kg consumed per person in 1985 to 106&nbsp;kg in 1995 and 83&nbsp;kg in 2003. The decrease in rice consumption has been accompanied by an increase in the consumption of bread and noodles.<ref>Pettid, 166.</ref>\n\n==Royal court cuisine==\n{{main|Korean royal court cuisine}}\n{{see also|List of Korean dishes#Royal court dishes}}\n\n[[File:Anapji Pond-Gyeongju-Korea-2006-09.jpg|thumb|[[Anapji Lake]] in [[Gyeongju]], the capital of [[Silla|Silla Kingdom]].]]\n\nCollectively known as ''gungjung eumsik'' during the pre-modern era, the foods of the royal palace were reflective of the opulent nature of the past rulers of the Korean peninsula. This nature is evidenced in examples as far back as the [[Silla]] kingdom, where a man-made lake ([[Anapji Lake]], located in [[Gyeongju]]), was created with multiple pavilions and halls for the sole purpose of opulent [[banquet]]s, and a spring fed channel, [[Poseokjeong]], was created for the singular purpose of setting wine cups afloat while they wrote poems.<ref>Pettid, 129</ref>\n\nReflecting the regionalism of the kingdoms and bordering countries of the peninsula, the cuisine borrowed portions from each of these areas to exist as a showcase. The royalty would have the finest regional specialties and delicacies sent to them at the palace. Although there are records of banquets predating the Joseon period, the majority of these records mostly reflect the vast variety of foods, but do not mention the specific foods presented.<ref>Pettid, 130.</ref> The meals cooked for the royal family did not reflect the seasons, as the commoner's meals would have. Instead, their meals varied significantly day-to-day. Each of the eight provinces was represented each month in the royal palace by ingredients presented by their governors, which gave the cooks a wide assortment of ingredients to use for royal meals.<ref>Pettid, 132.</ref>\n[[File:Korea-Dae Jang Geum Theme Park-41.jpg|thumb|A model of the royal kitchen in the [[Dae Jang Geum]] theme park, South Korea.]]\n\nFood was considered significant in the Joseon period. Official positions were created within the [[Six Ministries of Joseon|Six Ministries]] (''[[Yukjo]]'', \uc721\uc870) that were charged with all matters related to procurement and consumption of food and drink for the royal court. The Board of Personnel (''Ijo'', \uc774\uc870) contained positions specific for attaining rice for the royal family. The Board of Rights (''Yejo'') were responsible for foods prepared for ancestor rites, attaining wines and other beverages, and medicinal foods. There were also hundreds of slaves and women who worked in the palace that had tasks such as making [[tofu]], liquor, tea, and ''[[tteok]]'' (rice cakes). The women were the cooks to the royal palace and were of commoner or low-born families. These women would be split into specific skill sets or \"bureau\" such as the bureau of special foods (''Saenggwa-bang'', \uc0dd\uacfc\ubc29) or the bureau of cooking foods (''Soju-bang'', \uc18c\uc8fc\ubc29). These female cooks may have been assisted by male cooks from outside the palace during larger banquets when necessary.<ref>Pettid, 130-132.</ref>\n\nFive meals were generally served in the royal palace each day during the Joseon period, and records suggest this pattern had existed from antiquity. Three of these meals would be full meals, while the afternoon and after dinner meals would be lighter. The first meal, ''mieumsang'' (\ubbf8\uc74c\uc0c1), was served at sunrise and was served only on days when the king and queen were not taking herbal medicines. The meal consisted of [[rice congee|rice porridge]] (''juk'', \uc8fd) made with ingredients such as abalone (''[[jeonbokjuk]]''), white rice (''[[huinjuk]]''), mushrooms (''beoseotjuk''), pine nuts (''[[jatjuk]]''), and sesame (''kkaejuk''). The side dishes could consist of ''kimchi'', ''[[nabak kimchi]]'', oysters, soy sauce, and other items. The porridge was thought to give vitality to the king and queen throughout the day.<ref>Pettid, 133.</ref>\n\nThe ''sura'' (\uc218\ub77c) were the main meals of the day. Breakfast was served at ten in the morning, and the evening meals were served between six and seven at night. The set of three tables (''surasang'', \uc218\ub77c\uc0c1), were usually set with two types of rice, two types of soup, two types of stew (''[[jjigae]]''), one dish of ''[[jjim]]'' (meat stew), one dish of ''[[jeongol]]'' (a casserole of meat and vegetables), three types of ''kimchi'', three types of ''[[Korean condiments|jang]]'' (\uc7a5) and twelve side dishes,  called 12 cheop (12\ucca9). The meals were set in the ''[[suragan]]'' (\uc218\ub77c\uac04), a room specifically used for taking meals, with the king seated to the east and the queen to the west. Each had their own set of tables and were attended by three palace servant women known as ''[[sura sanggung]]'' (\uc218\ub77c\uc0c1\uad81). These women would remove bowl covers and offer the foods to the king and queen after ensuring the dishes were not poisoned.<ref>Pettid, 134-135.</ref>\n\nBanquets (\uad81\uc911 \uc5f0\ud68c \uc74c\uc2dd) were held on special occasions in the Korean Royal Palace. These included birthdays of the royal family members, marriages, and national festivals, including Daeborum, Dano, Chuseok, and Dongji.<ref name=\"koreafoods.net\">{{cite web|url=http://www.koreafoods.net|title=koreafoods.net|last=Olimiko|website=www.koreafoods.net|access-date=2019-08-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181113132154/http://koreafoods.net/|archive-date=2018-11-13|url-status=dead}}</ref> Banquet food was served on individual tables which varied according to the rank of the person. Usually banquet food consisted of ten different types of dishes. Main dishes were prepared based on the seasonal foods. Main dishes of the banquet included ''sinseollo'', ''jeon'', ''hwayang jeok'', ''honghapcho'', ''nengmyun'' and ''mulgimchi''.<ref name=\"koreafoods.net\"/> A typical banquet ingredient was ''chogyetang'' (chicken broth with vinegar), which was prepared with five different chickens, five abalones, ten sea cucumbers, twenty eggs, half a bellflower root, mushrooms, two cups of black pepper, two peeled pine nuts, starch, soy sauce and vinegar.

Korean cuisine has evolved through centuries of social and political change. Originating from ancient [[Prehistoric Korea|agricultural and nomadic traditions]] in Korea and southern [[Manchuria]], Korean cuisine has evolved through a complex interaction of the natural environment and different cultural trends.<ref name=\"han-style.com\"/><ref name=\"Korean Cuisine\">{{cite web|url=http://100.naver.com/100.nhn?docid=186015 |title=Korean Cuisine (\ud55c\uad6d\uc694\ub9ac \u97d3\u570b\u6599\u7406)|publisher=[[Naver]] / [[Doosan Encyclopedia]]|language=Korean|accessdate=2009-03-28}}</ref>\n\nKorean cuisine is largely based on [[rice]], [[vegetable]]s, and (at least in the South) [[meat]]s. Traditional Korean meals are named for the number of [[side dish]]es (\ubc18\ucc2c; \u98ef\u994c; ''[[banchan]]'') that accompany [[steaming|steam-cooked]] short-grain rice. [[Kimchi]] is served at nearly every meal. Commonly used ingredients include [[sesame oil]], ''[[doenjang]]'' ([[fermented bean paste]]), [[Korean soy sauce|soy sauce]], salt, garlic, ginger, ''[[gochukaru]]'' ([[chili pepper|pepper]] flakes), ''[[gochujang]]'' (fermented red chili paste) and [[napa cabbage]].\n\nIngredients and dishes vary by province. Many regional dishes have become national, and dishes that were once regional have proliferated in different variations across the country. [[Korean royal court cuisine]] once brought all of the unique regional specialties together for the royal family. Foods are regulated by Korean cultural [[etiquette]].\n\n==Food==\n===Grains===\n[[File:Korea-Icheon-Dolsotbap-Cooked rice in a stone pot-01.jpg|thumb|alt=Cooked rice sprinkled with four pieces of dried grape and cooked three chestnut in a black stone pot|''Dolsotbap'', cooked rice in a stone pot (''[[dolsot]]'')]][[Grain]]s have been one of the most important staples of the Korean diet. Early myths of the foundations of various kingdoms in Korea center on grains. One foundation myth relates to [[Jumong]], who received [[barley]] seeds from two [[dove]]s sent by his mother after establishing the kingdom of [[Goguryeo]].<ref>Yi Kyubo, 1-9.</ref> Yet another myth speaks of the three founding deities of [[Jeju-do|Jeju Island]], who were to be wed to the three princesses of [[Tamna]]; the deities brought seeds of five grains which were the first seeds planted, which in turn became the first instance of farming.<ref>Kory\u01d2sa, 57, 53b-54b.</ref>\n\nDuring the pre-modern era, grains such as barley and millet were the main staples. They were supplemented by wheat, [[sorghum]], and [[buckwheat]]. Rice is not an indigenous crop to Korea and millet was likely the preferred grain before rice was cultivated. Rice became the grain of choice during the Three Kingdoms period, particularly in the [[Silla]] and [[Baekje]] Kingdoms in the southern regions of the peninsula. Rice was such an important commodity in Silla that it was used to pay taxes. The [[Sino-Korean vocabulary|Sino-Korean]] word for \"tax\" is a compound character that uses the character for the rice plant. The preference for rice escalated into the [[Joseon period]], when new methods of cultivation and new varieties emerged that would help increase production.<ref name=\"Pettid3\">Pettid, 33.</ref>\n\nAs rice was prohibitively expensive when it first came to Korea, the grain was likely mixed with other grains to \"stretch\" the rice; this is still done in dishes such as ''boribap'' (rice with barley) and ''[[kongbap]]'' (rice with beans).<ref name=\"Joins\">{{cite news |url=http://article.joins.com/article/article.asp?total_id=2685876 |title=The reason why kongbap changed to boribap (\ucf69\uc0ac\uc5f0) |newspaper=[[JoongAng Ilbo]] |author=Yu Ji-sang (\uc720\uc9c0\uc0c1) |language=Korean |accessdate=2009-03-28 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090126133718/http://article.joins.com/article/article.asp?total_id=2685876 |archivedate=2009-01-26 }}</ref> White rice, which is rice with the bran removed, has been the preferred form of rice since its introduction into the cuisine. The most traditional method of cooking the rice has been to cook it in an iron pot called a ''sot'' (\uc1a5) or ''musoe sot'' (\ubb34\uc1e0\uc1a5). This method of rice cookery dates back to at least the [[Goryeo period]], and these pots have even been found in tombs from the Silla period. The ''sot'' is still used today, much in the same manner as it was in the past centuries.<ref name=\"Pettid4\">Pettid, 34.</ref>\n\nRice is used to make a number of items, outside of the traditional bowl of plain white rice. It is commonly ground into a flour and used to make rice cakes called ''[[tteok]]'' in over two hundred varieties. It is also cooked down into a [[congee]] (''juk'') or [[gruel]] (''mieum'') and mixed with other grains, meat, or seafood. Koreans also produce a number of [[rice wine]]s, both in filtered and unfiltered versions.<ref name=\"Pettid4\"/>\n\n===Legumes===\n[[File:Korean noodles-Kongguksu-01.jpg|thumb|alt=A wheat noodles with a cold white broth in a stainless bowl|''[[Kongguksu]]'', a cold noodle dish with a broth made from ground soy beans]]\n[[Legume]]s have been significant crops in Korean history and cuisine, according to the earliest preserved legumes found in [[archaeological site]]s in Korea.<ref>Crawford, (2006), p. 81.</ref><ref>Crawford and Lee, (2003).</ref> The excavation at Okbang site, [[Jinju]], [[South Gyeongsang]] province indicates [[soybean]]s were cultivated as a food crop ''circa'' 1000\u2013900 BCE.<ref>Crawford and Lee, (2003), p.90</ref> They are made into [[tofu]] (''dubu''), while soybean sprouts are sauteed as a vegetable (''[[kongnamul]]'') and whole soybeans are seasoned and served as a side dish.

A byproduct of soy milk production is ''[[soy pulp|biji]]'' or ''kong-biji'', which is used to thicken stews and porridges. Soybeans may also be one of the beans in ''[[kongbap]]'', boiled together with several types of beans and other grains, and they are also the primary ingredient in the production of fermented condiments collectively referred to as ''jang'', such as soybean pastes, ''[[doenjang]]'' and ''[[cheonggukjang]]'', a soy sauce called ''[[Korean soy sauce|ganjang]]'', chili pepper paste or ''[[gochujang]]'' and others.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://100.nate.com/dicsearch/pentry.html?s=K&i=258316&v=42|script-title=ko:\uc7a5 \u91ac|trans-title=Jang|publisher=[[Nate (web portal)|Nate]] / [[Encyclopedia of Korean Culture]]|language=Korean|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611054456/http://100.nate.com/dicsearch/pentry.html?s=K&i=258316&v=42|archivedate=2011-06-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://100.nate.com/dicsearch/pentry.html?s=K&i=255559&v=44|script-title=ko:\ucf69|trans-title=Kong|publisher=[[Nate (web portal)|Nate]] / [[Encyclopedia of Korean Culture]]|language=Korean|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611054521/http://100.nate.com/dicsearch/pentry.html?s=K&i=255559&v=44|archivedate=2011-06-11}}</ref>\n[[File:Korean shredded mung bean jelly with vegetables-Tangpyeongchae-01.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A salad consisting of slices of half transparent jelly-like food and vegetables|''[[Tangpyeongchae]]'', a dish made with ''[[nokdumuk]]'' (a mung bean starch jelly) and vegetables]]\n[[Mung bean]]s are commonly used in Korean cuisine, where they are called ''nokdu'' ({{Lang-ko|\ub179\ub450}}; Hanja: \u7da0\u8c46; {{Literal translation|\"Green bean\"}}).

A porridge made with azuki beans, called ''[[patjuk]]'', is commonly eaten during the winter season. On [[Dongzhi Festival|Dongjinal]], a Korean traditional holiday which falls on December 22, Korean people eat ''donji patjuk'', which contains ''saealsim'' (\uc0c8\uc54c\uc2ec), a ball made from glutinous rice flour.

Fermented condiments include ''[[ganjang]]'', ''[[doenjang]]'', ''[[gochujang]]'' and vinegars. Nonfermented condiments or spices include red pepper, black pepper, cordifolia, mustard, chinensis, garlic, onion, ginger, leek, and scallion (spring onion).<ref>Shin, Dong Hwa \"Korean Traditional Food: Status, Prospects, and Vision for Globalization\" Chonbuk National University, 2004</ref>\n\n===Gochujang===\n[[Gochujang]] can be found in many writings. Some of the writings are the ''Mankiyoram'', ''The Three States'', the ''Nonggawolryeongga'', the ''Gijaejapgi'', and the ''Hyangyak-jipsongbang''. The ''Hyangyak-jipsongbang'', which dates back to around 1433 during the Chosun Dynasty, is one of the oldest writings mentioning gochujang.\n\nGochujang is a fermented bean paste that has red pepper powder, soybean powder and rice flour added to it to create a spicy paste. It typically can be added to most dishes. Gochujang can be used as a seasoning and sometimes as a dipping sauce.\n\nMany variations come from ''jang'', fermented bean paste. Some variations can include [[doenjang]] (soybean and brine), [[kanjang]] (soybeans, water, and salt), [[chogochujang]] (gochujang and vinegar), and [[jeotgal]] (mixture of other jangs and seafoods).\n\nVegetables such as cucumbers, carrots, and cabbage use gochujang as a dip. Gochujang is a common seasoning for foods such as Korean barbecue including pork and beef. One popular snack food that is very commonly eaten with gochujang is bibimbap. [[Bibimbap]] includes rice, spinach, radish, bean sprouts. Sometimes beef is added to bibimbap. Another popular dish including gochujang is [[tteokbokki]].\n\nGochujang was used to revitalize people who were sick with colds or exhaustion during the Chosun Period. There have been some studies that show that red peppers fight obesity and diabetes. Gochujang is also added to many foods so that there can be additional nutritional value with each meal.<ref>Kim, S., Chung, K. R., Yang, H., & Kwon, D. Y.

DOI:10.1016/j.jef.2015.02.006</ref>\n\n===Meat===\n[[File:Yayeon_(Night_Banquet).jpg|thumb|right|Koreans enjoying grilled meat and alcohol in the 18th century]]\n{{see also|List of Korean dishes#Meat-based dishes}}\nIn antiquity, most meat in Korea was likely obtained through [[hunting]] and [[fishing]]. Ancient records indicate rearing of [[livestock]] began on a small scale during the Three Kingdoms period. Meat was consumed roasted or in soups or stews during this period. Those who lived closer to the oceans were able to complement their diet with more fish, while those who lived in the interior had a diet containing more meat.<ref>Pettid, 58.</ref>\n\n====Beef====\n[[File:Korean barbeque-Yangnyeom galbi-01.jpg|thumb|Marinated [[galbi]] before grilling'']]\n[[Beef]] is the most prized of all, with the cattle holding an important cultural role in the Korean home. Beef is prepared in numerous ways today, including roasting, grilling (''[[Gui (food)|gui]]'') or boiling in [[guk|soups]]. Beef can also be dried into ''[[yukpo]]'', a type of ''[[po (food)|po]]'', as with seafood, called ''[[eopo]]''.<ref>Pettid, 60.</ref>\n\nThe cattle were valuable draught animals, often seen as equal to human servants, or in some cases, members of the family. Cattle were also given their own holiday during the first 'cow' day of the [[Korean New Year|lunar New Year]]. The importance of cattle does not suggest Koreans ate an abundance of beef, however, as the cattle were valued as [[Pack animal|beasts of burden]] and slaughtering one would create dire issues in farming the land. Pork and seafood were consumed more regularly for this reason. The Buddhist ruling class of the Goryeo period forbade the consumption of beef. The [[Mongol]]s dispensed with the ban of beef during the 13th century, and they promoted the production of beef cattle. This increased production continued into the Joseon period, when the government encouraged both increased quantities and quality of beef.<ref>Pettid, 59-60.</ref> Only in the latter part of the 20th century has beef become regular table fare.\n\n====Chicken====\n[[Chicken (food)|Chicken]] has played an important role as a protein in Korean history, evidenced by a number of myths. One myth tells of the birth of [[Kim Alji]], founder of the [[Kim (Korean name)#Gyeongju|Kim family]] of [[Gyeongju]] being announced by the cry of a white chicken. As the birth of a clan's founder is always announced by an animal with preternatural qualities, this myth speaks to the importance of chicken in Korean culture. Chicken is often served roasted or braised with vegetables or in soups. All parts of the chicken are used in Korean cuisine, including the [[gizzard]], [[liver]], and feet. Young chickens are braised with [[ginseng]] and other ingredients in medicinal soups eaten during the summer months to combat heat called ''[[samgyetang]]''. The feet of the chicken, called ''dakbal'' (\ub2ed\ubc1c), are often roasted and covered with hot and spicy ''[[gochujang]]''-based sauce and served as an ''[[anju (food)|anju]]'', or side dish, to accompany [[Korean alcoholic beverages|alcoholic beverages]], especially ''[[soju]]''.<ref name=\"Pettid, 62\"/><ref>Yu Jisang (\uc720\uc9c0\uc0c1)</ref>\n\n====Pork====\n[[File:Korean barbeque-Samgyeopsal-06.jpg|thumb|''[[Samgyeopsal]]'']]\n[[Pork]] has also been another important land-based protein for Korea. Records indicate pork has been a part of the Korean diet back to antiquity, similar to beef.<ref>Pettid, 61.</ref>\n\nA number of foods have been avoided while eating pork, including [[Chinese bellflower]] (''doraji'', \ub3c4\ub77c\uc9c0) and [[lotus root]] (''yeonn ppuri'', \uc5f0\ubfcc\ub9ac), as the combinations have been thought to cause diarrhea. All parts of the pig are used in Korean cuisine, including the head, intestines, liver, kidney and other internal organs. Koreans utilize these parts in a variety of cooking methods including steaming, stewing, boiling and smoking.<ref name=\"Pettid, 62\">Pettid, 62.</ref> Koreans especially like to eat grilled pork belly, which is called ''[[samgyeopsal]]'' (\uc0bc\uacb9\uc0b4, \u4e09--).<ref name=\"Pettid, 62\" />\n\n====Fish and seafood====\n{{see also|List of Korean dishes#Fish-based dishes|Jeotgal}}\n[[File:Korean.cuisine-Ganjang gejang and banchan-01.jpg|thumb|A bowl of ''[[gejang]]'', marinated crabs in soy sauce and plates of various ''[[banchan]]'' (small side dishes)]]\n[[Fish (food)|Fish]] and [[shellfish]] have been a major part of Korean cuisine because of the oceans bordering the peninsula. Evidence from the 12th century illustrates commoners consumed a diet mostly of fish and shellfish, such as [[Shrimp (food)|shrimp]], [[clam]]s, [[oyster]]s, [[abalone]], and [[Cobitidae|loach]], while [[sheep]] and hogs were reserved for the upper class.<ref name=\"Pettid5\">Pettid, 63.</ref>\n\nBoth fresh and saltwater fish are popular, and are served raw, grilled, broiled, dried or served in soups and stews. Common grilled fish include [[Mackerel (food)|mackerel]], [[hairtail]], [[Sciaenidae|croaker]] and [[Pacific herring]]. Smaller fish, shrimp, squid, mollusks and countless other seafood can be salted and fermented as ''[[jeotgal]]''. Fish can also be grilled either whole or in fillets as [[banchan]]. Fish is often dried naturally to prolong storing periods and enable shipping over long distances. Fish commonly dried include [[yellow corvina]], [[Anchovy (food)|anchovies]] (''myeolchi'') and [[Sciaenidae|croaker]].<ref name=\"Pettid5\"/> Dried anchovies, along with kelp, form the basis of common soup stocks.<ref>Marks, 8.</ref>\n\nShellfish is widely eaten in all different types of preparation.

The main dishes are made from grains such as ''bap'' (a bowl of rice), ''[[Rice congee|juk]]'' (porridge), and ''[[Korean noodles|guksu]]'' (noodles).\n\nMany Korean ''banchan'' rely on fermentation for flavor and preservation, resulting in a tangy, salty, and spicy taste. Certain regions are especially associated with some dishes (for example, the city of [[Jeonju]] with ''[[bibimbap]]'') either as a place of origin or for a famous regional variety.

Soups known as ''[[guk]]'' are often made with meats, shellfish and vegetables. Soups can be made into more formal soups known as ''[[tang (food)|tang]]'', often served as the main dish of the meal.

Some versions of this soup may also use the beef head and intestines. The only seasoning generally used in the soup is salt.\n* ''[[Naengguk]]'' (\ub0c9\uad6d), which are cold soups generally eaten during the summer months to cool the diner.

''[[Gwapyeon]]'' is a [[Gelatin dessert|jelly]]-like confection made by boiling sour fruits, starch, and sugar. ''[[Dasik]]'', literally \"eatery for tea\", is made by kneading rice flour, honey, and various types of flour from nuts, herbs, sesame, or jujubes. ''[[Jeonggwa]]'', or ''jeongwa'', is made by boiling fruits, plant roots and seeds in honey, [[yeot|mullyeot]] (''\ubb3c\uc5ff'', liquid candy) or sugar.

Each person was given a table in traditional dining setting.]]\n[[File:Korean chopsticks and spoon-Sujeo-01.jpg|thumb|160px|Korean [[chopsticks]] and [[spoon]] made of [[stainless steel]].]]\nDining etiquette in Korea can be traced back to the [[Confucian]] philosophies of the Joseon period. Guidebooks, such as ''[[Sasojeol]]'' (\u58eb\u5c0f\u7bc0, ''Elementary Etiquette for Scholar Families''), written in 1775 by Yi Deokmu (\uc774\ub355\ubb34; \u674e\u5fb7\u61cb), comment on the dining etiquette for the period. Suggestions include items such as \"when you see a fat cow, goat, pig, or chicken, do not immediately speak of slaughtering, cooking or eating it\",<ref name=\"Quote1\">Yi T\u01d2ngmu 62.</ref> \"when you are having a meal with others, do not speak of smelly or dirty things, such as boils or [[diarrhea]],\"<ref name=\"Quote1\"/>  \"when eating a meal, neither eat so slowly as to appear to be eating against your will nor so fast as if to be taking someone else's food. Do not throw chopsticks on the table. Spoons should not touch plates, making a clashing sound\",<ref name=\"Quote1\"/> among many other recommendations which emphasized proper [[table etiquette]].\n\nOther than the etiquette mentioned above, blowing one's nose when having a meal is considered an inappropriate act as well. Such act should be avoided.\n\nThe eldest male at the table was always served first, and was commonly served in the men's quarters by the women of the house.  Women usually dined in a separate portion of the house after the men were served. The eldest men or women always ate before the younger family members. The meal was usually quiet, as conversation was discouraged during meals. In modern times, these rules have become lax, as families usually dine together now and use the time to converse. Of the remaining elements of this decorum, one is that the younger members of the table should not pick up their [[chopsticks]] or start eating before the elders of the table or guests and should not finish eating before the elders or guests finish eating.<ref name=\"etiquette1\">Pettid, 159.</ref><ref name=\"Jang et al. 2005, p.102\">Jang et al. (2005, p.102).</ref>\n\nIn Korea, unlike in other East Asian cuisines such as [[Chinese cuisine|Chinese]] and [[Japanese cuisine|Japanese]], the rice or soup bowl is not lifted from the table when eating from it. This is due to the fact that each diner is given a metal spoon along with the chopsticks known collectively as [[sujeo]]. The use of the spoon for eating rice and soups is expected. There are rules which reflect the decorum of sharing communal side dishes; rules include not picking through the dishes for certain items while leaving others, and the spoon used should be clean, because usually diners put their spoons in the same serving bowl on the table. Diners should also cover their mouths when using a [[toothpick]] after the meal.<ref name=\"etiquette1\"/><ref name=\"Jang et al. 2005, p.102\"/>\n\nThe table setup is important as well, and individual place settings, moving from the diner's left should be as follows: rice bowl, spoon, then chopsticks. Hot foods are set to the right side of the table, with the cold foods to the left. Soup must remain on the right side of the diner along with [[stew]]s. Vegetables remain on the left along with the rice, and [[kimchi]] is set to the back while sauces remain in the front.<ref name=\"etiquette1\"/>\n\n===Drinking===\nThe manner of drinking [[Soju|alcoholic drinks]] while dining is significant in [[Drinking culture of Korea|Korean dining etiquette]]. Each diner is expected to face away from the [[Korean Confucianism|eldest male]] and cover his mouth when drinking alcohol.\nAccording to Hyang Eum Ju Rye (\ud5a5\uc74c\uc8fc\ub840; \u9115\u98ee\u9152\u79ae), the drinking etiquette established in [[Choseon Dynasty]], it is impolite for a king and his vassal, a father and his son, or a teacher and his student to drink face to face. Also, a guest should not refuse the first drink offered by host, and in the most formal situations, the diner should politely twice refuse a drink offered by the eldest male or a host. When the host offers for the third time, then finally the guest can receive it. If the guest refuses three times, drink is not to be offered any more.<ref>Jeong, H. (2011).

The second kingdom, [[Baekje]] (18 BCE&nbsp;\u2013 660 CE), was in the southwestern portion of the peninsula, and the third, [[Silla]] (57 BCE&nbsp;\u2013 935 CE), was located at the southeastern portion of the peninsula. Each region had its own distinct set of cultural practices and foods. For example, Baekje was known for cold foods and fermented foods like ''[[kimchi]]''.

During 1429, the government began publishing books on agriculture and farming techniques, which included ''[[Nongsa jikseol]]'' (literally \"Straight Talk on Farming\"), an agricultural book compiled under [[King Sejong]].<ref name=\"National Assembly\">King Sejong's Humanism, from [[National Assembly of the Republic of Korea]]</ref><ref>Pettid, 17.</ref><ref>[[The Academy of Korean Studies]]\n</ref>\n\nA series of invasions in the earlier half of the Joseon caused a dynamic shift in the culture during the second half of the period. Groups of ''[[silhak]]'' (\"practical learning\") scholars began to emphasize the importance of looking outside the country for innovation and technology to help improve the agricultural systems. Crops traded by Europeans from the [[New World]] began to appear, acquired through trade with China, Japan, Europe, and the [[Philippines]]; these crops included corn, sweet potatoes, chili peppers, tomatoes, peanuts, and [[Squash (plant)|squash]]. Potatoes and sweet potatoes were particularly favored as they grew in soils and on terrains that were previously unused.<ref>Pettid, 18-19.</ref>\n\nGovernment further developed agriculture through technology and lower taxation. Complex [[irrigation system]]s built by government allowed peasant farmers to produce larger crop volumes and produce crops not only for sustenance but also as [[cash crop]]s. Reduced taxation of the peasantry also furthered the expanded commerce through increasing periodic markets, usually held every five days. One thousand such markets existed in the 19th century, and were communal centers for economic trade and entertainment.<ref>Pettid, 18.</ref>\n\nThe end of the Joseon period was marked by consistent encouragement to trade with the Western world, China and Japan. In the 1860s, trade agreements pushed by the Japanese government led the [[Joseon Dynasty]] to open its trade ports with the west, and to numerous treaties with the United States, Britain, France, and other Western countries.<ref>Pettid, 19.</ref>\n\nThe opening of Korea to the Western world brought further exchange of culture and food. Western missionaries introduced new ingredients and dishes to Korea. Joseon elites were introduced to these new foods by way of foreigners who attended the royal court as advisers or physicians. This period also saw the introduction of various seasonings imported from Japan via western traders and alcoholic drinks from China.<ref>Pettid, 163.</ref>\n\n===Colonial period to Modern period===\n[[File:Korean.food-Budaejjigae-01.jpg|thumb|alt=A spicy stew in a pot|''[[Budae jjigae]]'', a spicy stew originated during the Korean War.]]\n[[File:Korean chicken dish in Sydney, Australia.JPG|thumb|Korean chicken dish (Jjimdak) in Sydney, Australia]]\n\nJapan colonized [[Korean peninsula]] from 1910 to 1945. Many of the agricultural systems were taken over by the Japanese to support Japan's food supply. Land changes resulting from the Japanese occupation included combining small farms into large-scale farms, which led to larger yields. Rice production increased during this period to support the Japanese Empire's war efforts. Many Koreans, in turn, increased the production of other grains for their own consumption.<ref name=\"Pettid2\">Pettid, 19-20.</ref>\n\nMeals during the Japanese occupation were quite varied. Koreans usually ate two meals a day during the cold seasons, and three during the warm seasons. For the lower classes, satiety, rather than quality, was most important. Those in even lower economic levels were likely to enjoy only a single bowl of white rice ''each year'', while the remainder of the year was filled with cheaper grains, such as [[millet]] and [[barley]].<ref>Pettid, 29,163.</ref> For the Korean middle and upper classes during the occupation, things were quite different. Western foods began emerging in the Korean diet, such as white bread and commercially produced staples such as precooked noodles. The Japanese occupational period ended after the defeat of Japan during [[World War II]].<ref>Pettid, 20.</ref>\n\nThe country remained in a state of turmoil through the [[Korean War]] (1950\u20131953) and the [[Cold War]], which separated the country into [[North Korea]] and [[South Korea]]. Both of these periods continued the limited food provisions for Koreans,<ref name=\"Pettid2\"/> and the stew called ''[[budae jjigae]]'', which makes use of inexpensive meats such as sausage and [[Spam (food)|Spam]], originated during this period.\n\n[[File:Koreatown NY Food.JPG|thumb|Korean restaurant dishes in Koreatown, New York City]]\n\nAt this point, the history of North and South Korea sharply diverged.  In the 1960s under President [[Park Chung-hee]], industrialization began to give South Korea the economic and cultural power it holds in the global economy today. Agriculture was increased through use of commercial fertilizers and modern farming equipment. In the 1970s, food shortages began to lessen. Consumption of instant and processed foods increased, as did the overall quality of foods. [[Livestock]] and dairy production was increased during the 1970s through the increase of commercial dairies and mechanized farms.<ref>Pettid, 164-165.</ref> The consumption of pork and beef increased vastly in the 1970s. Per-capita consumption of meat was 3.6&nbsp;kg in 1961 and 11&nbsp;kg by 1979. The result of this increased meat consumption brought about the rise of ''[[bulgogi]]'' restaurants, which gave the middle class of South Korea the ability to enjoy meat regularly. Meat eating continued to rise, reaching 40&nbsp;kg in 1997, with fish consumption at 49.5&nbsp;kg in 1998. Rice consumption continually decreased through these years, with 128&nbsp;kg consumed per person in 1985 to 106&nbsp;kg in 1995 and 83&nbsp;kg in 2003. The decrease in rice consumption has been accompanied by an increase in the consumption of bread and noodles.<ref>Pettid, 166.</ref>\n\n==Royal court cuisine==\n{{main|Korean royal court cuisine}}\n{{see also|List of Korean dishes#Royal court dishes}}\n\n[[File:Anapji Pond-Gyeongju-Korea-2006-09.jpg|thumb|[[Anapji Lake]] in [[Gyeongju]], the capital of [[Silla|Silla Kingdom]].]]\n\nCollectively known as ''gungjung eumsik'' during the pre-modern era, the foods of the royal palace were reflective of the opulent nature of the past rulers of the Korean peninsula. This nature is evidenced in examples as far back as the [[Silla]] kingdom, where a man-made lake ([[Anapji Lake]], located in [[Gyeongju]]), was created with multiple pavilions and halls for the sole purpose of opulent [[banquet]]s, and a spring fed channel, [[Poseokjeong]], was created for the singular purpose of setting wine cups afloat while they wrote poems.<ref>Pettid, 129</ref>\n\nReflecting the regionalism of the kingdoms and bordering countries of the peninsula, the cuisine borrowed portions from each of these areas to exist as a showcase. The royalty would have the finest regional specialties and delicacies sent to them at the palace. Although there are records of banquets predating the Joseon period, the majority of these records mostly reflect the vast variety of foods, but do not mention the specific foods presented.<ref>Pettid, 130.</ref> The meals cooked for the royal family did not reflect the seasons, as the commoner's meals would have. Instead, their meals varied significantly day-to-day. Each of the eight provinces was represented each month in the royal palace by ingredients presented by their governors, which gave the cooks a wide assortment of ingredients to use for royal meals.<ref>Pettid, 132.</ref>\n[[File:Korea-Dae Jang Geum Theme Park-41.jpg|thumb|A model of the royal kitchen in the [[Dae Jang Geum]] theme park, South Korea.]]\n\nFood was considered significant in the Joseon period. Official positions were created within the [[Six Ministries of Joseon|Six Ministries]] (''[[Yukjo]]'', \uc721\uc870) that were charged with all matters related to procurement and consumption of food and drink for the royal court. The Board of Personnel (''Ijo'', \uc774\uc870) contained positions specific for attaining rice for the royal family. The Board of Rights (''Yejo'') were responsible for foods prepared for ancestor rites, attaining wines and other beverages, and medicinal foods. There were also hundreds of slaves and women who worked in the palace that had tasks such as making [[tofu]], liquor, tea, and ''[[tteok]]'' (rice cakes). The women were the cooks to the royal palace and were of commoner or low-born families. These women would be split into specific skill sets or \"bureau\" such as the bureau of special foods (''Saenggwa-bang'', \uc0dd\uacfc\ubc29) or the bureau of cooking foods (''Soju-bang'', \uc18c\uc8fc\ubc29). These female cooks may have been assisted by male cooks from outside the palace during larger banquets when necessary.<ref>Pettid, 130-132.</ref>\n\nFive meals were generally served in the royal palace each day during the Joseon period, and records suggest this pattern had existed from antiquity. Three of these meals would be full meals, while the afternoon and after dinner meals would be lighter. The first meal, ''mieumsang'' (\ubbf8\uc74c\uc0c1), was served at sunrise and was served only on days when the king and queen were not taking herbal medicines. The meal consisted of [[rice congee|rice porridge]] (''juk'', \uc8fd) made with ingredients such as abalone (''[[jeonbokjuk]]''), white rice (''[[huinjuk]]''), mushrooms (''beoseotjuk''), pine nuts (''[[jatjuk]]''), and sesame (''kkaejuk''). The side dishes could consist of ''kimchi'', ''[[nabak kimchi]]'', oysters, soy sauce, and other items. The porridge was thought to give vitality to the king and queen throughout the day.<ref>Pettid, 133.</ref>\n\nThe ''sura'' (\uc218\ub77c) were the main meals of the day. Breakfast was served at ten in the morning, and the evening meals were served between six and seven at night. The set of three tables (''surasang'', \uc218\ub77c\uc0c1), were usually set with two types of rice, two types of soup, two types of stew (''[[jjigae]]''), one dish of ''[[jjim]]'' (meat stew), one dish of ''[[jeongol]]'' (a casserole of meat and vegetables), three types of ''kimchi'', three types of ''[[Korean condiments|jang]]'' (\uc7a5) and twelve side dishes,  called 12 cheop (12\ucca9). The meals were set in the ''[[suragan]]'' (\uc218\ub77c\uac04), a room specifically used for taking meals, with the king seated to the east and the queen to the west. Each had their own set of tables and were attended by three palace servant women known as ''[[sura sanggung]]'' (\uc218\ub77c\uc0c1\uad81). These women would remove bowl covers and offer the foods to the king and queen after ensuring the dishes were not poisoned.<ref>Pettid, 134-135.</ref>\n\nBanquets (\uad81\uc911 \uc5f0\ud68c \uc74c\uc2dd) were held on special occasions in the Korean Royal Palace. These included birthdays of the royal family members, marriages, and national festivals, including Daeborum, Dano, Chuseok, and Dongji.<ref name=\"koreafoods.net\">{{cite web|url=http://www.koreafoods.net|title=koreafoods.net|last=Olimiko|website=www.koreafoods.net|access-date=2019-08-22|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181113132154/http://koreafoods.net/|archive-date=2018-11-13|url-status=dead}}</ref> Banquet food was served on individual tables which varied according to the rank of the person. Usually banquet food consisted of ten different types of dishes. Main dishes were prepared based on the seasonal foods. Main dishes of the banquet included ''sinseollo'', ''jeon'', ''hwayang jeok'', ''honghapcho'', ''nengmyun'' and ''mulgimchi''.<ref name=\"koreafoods.net\"/> A typical banquet ingredient was ''chogyetang'' (chicken broth with vinegar), which was prepared with five different chickens, five abalones, ten sea cucumbers, twenty eggs, half a bellflower root, mushrooms, two cups of black pepper, two peeled pine nuts, starch, soy sauce and vinegar.

At the extremes, if surface mined lands are declared national sacrifice areas, all ecological zones have a high probability of being successfully rehabilitated.

The [[National Academy of Sciences]]/[[National Academy of Engineering]] Study Committee on the Potential for Rehabilitating Lands Surface Mined for Coal in the Western United States produced a 1973 report that introduced the term, finding:<blockquote>In each zone the probability of rehabilitating an area depends upon the land use objectives, the characteristics of the site, the technology available, and the skill with which this technology is applied. At the extremes, if surface mined lands are declared national sacrifice areas, all ecological zones have a high probability of being successfully rehabilitated. If, however, complete restoration is the objective, rehabilitation in each zone has no probability of success.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Rehabilitation potential of western coal lands|last=National Research Council (U.

The characteristic trade of silk through the [[Silk Road]] connected various regions from China, India, Central Asia, and the Middle East to Europe and Africa.]]\n\nThe '''history of Asia''' can be seen as the collective history of several distinct peripheral coastal regions such as [[East Asia]], [[South Asia]], [[History of Southeast Asia|Southeast Asia]] and the [[Middle East]] linked by the interior mass of the Eurasian [[steppe]].\n\nThe coastal periphery was the home to some of the world's earliest known civilizations and religions, with each of the three regions developing early civilizations around fertile river valleys. These valleys were fertile because the soil there was rich and could bear many root crops. The civilizations in [[Mesopotamia]], [[India]], and [[China]] shared many similarities and likely exchanged technologies and ideas such as mathematics and the wheel. Other notions such as that of writing likely developed individually in each area. Cities, states and then empires developed in these lowlands.\n\nThe steppe region had long been inhabited by mounted nomads, and from the central steppes they could reach all areas of the Asian continent. The northern part of the continent, covering much of [[Siberia]] was also inaccessible to the steppe nomads due to the dense forests and the [[tundra]]. These areas in Siberia were very sparsely populated.\n\nThe centre and periphery were kept separate by mountains and deserts. The [[Caucasus Mountains|Caucasus]], [[Himalayas|Himalaya]], [[Karakum Desert]], and [[Gobi Desert]] formed barriers that the steppe horsemen could only cross with difficulty.  While technologically and culturally the city dwellers were more advanced, they could do little militarily to defend against the mounted hordes of the steppe.  However, the lowlands did not have enough open grasslands to support a large horsebound force.  Thus the nomads who conquered states in the Middle East were soon forced to adapt to the local societies.\n\nThe [[spread of Islam]] waved the [[Islamic Golden Age]] and the [[Timurid Renaissance]], which later influenced the [[Islamic Gunpowders]].\n\nAsia's history features major developments seen in other parts of the world, as well as events that have affected those other regions. These include the trade of the [[Silk Road]], which spread cultures, languages, religions, and diseases throughout Afro-Eurasian trade. Another major advancement was the innovation of [[gunpowder]] in medieval China, later developed by the Gunpowder empires, mainly by the [[Mughal tribe|Mughal]]s and [[Safavid]]s, which led to advanced warfare through the use of guns.\n\n{{TOC limit|limit=3}}\n\n==Prehistory==\n{{main|Prehistory of Asia}}\nA report by archaeologist Rakesh Tewari on Lahuradewa, [[India]] shows new C14 datings that range between 9000 and 8000 BCE associated with rice, making Lahuradewa the earliest Neolithic site in entire South Asia.<ref name=\"archae\">{{cite web\n|url=http://www.uparchaeology.org/archae.pdf\n|title=Second preliminary report of the excavations at Lahuradewa district\n|publisher=Directorate of Archaeology (U.P, India)\n|url-status=dead\n|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613040512/http://www.uparchaeology.org/archae.pdf\n|archivedate=2011-06-13\n|df=\n}}\n</ref>\n\nThe [[prehistoric Beifudi site]] near Yixian in [[Hebei]] Province, China,  contains relics of a culture contemporaneous with the [[Cishan culture|Cishan]] and [[Xinglongwa culture|Xinglongwa]] cultures of about 8000\u20137000 BCE, neolithic cultures east of the [[Taihang Mountains]],  filling in an archaeological gap between the two Northern Chinese cultures.

Some of the great cities of this civilization include [[Harappa]] and [[Mohenjo-daro]], which had a high level of town planning and arts. The cause of the destruction of these regions around 1700 BCE is debatable, although evidence suggests it was caused by natural disasters (especially flooding).<ref>{{cite web|title=The Indus Valley Civilisation|url=http://library.thinkquest.org/11372/data/history.htm|work=ThinkQuest|accessdate=9 February 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130509014129/http://library.thinkquest.org/11372/data/history.htm|archivedate=9 May 2013|df=}}</ref> This era marks [[Vedic period]] in India, which lasted from roughly 1500 to 500 BCE.

Persian politics included a tolerance for other cultures, a highly [[centralized government]], and significant infrastructure developments. Later, in [[Darius I|Darius the Great]]'s rule, the territories were integrated, a bureaucracy was developed, nobility were assigned military positions, tax collection was carefully organized, and spies were used to ensure the loyalty of regional officials. The primary religion of Persia at this time was [[Zoroastrianism]], developed by the philosopher [[Zoroaster]]. It introduced an early form of [[monotheism]] to the area. The religion banned animal sacrifice and the use of intoxicants in rituals; and introduced the concept of spiritual salvation through personal moral action, an [[end time]], and both [[General judgment|general]] and [[Particular judgment]] with a [[heaven]] or [[hell]]. These concepts would heavily influence later emperors and the masses. More importantly, Zoroastrianism would be an important precursor for the [[Abrahamic religions]] such as Christianity, Islam, or Judaism. The Persian Empire was successful in establishing peace and stability throughout the Middle East and were a major influence in art, politics (affecting Hellenistic leaders), and religion.\n\n[[Alexander the Great]] conquered this dynasty in the 4th century BCE, creating the brief [[Hellenistic period]]. He was unable to establish stability and after his death, Persia broke into small, weak dynasties including the [[Seleucid Empire]], followed by the [[Parthian Empire]]. By the end of the Classical age, Persia had been reconsolidated into the [[Sassanid Empire]], also known as the second Persian Empire.\n\nThe [[Roman Empire]] would later control parts of Western Asia. The [[Seleucid]], [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] and [[Sassanid]] dynasties of Persia dominated Western Asia for centuries.\n\n====India====\n{{See also|Greater India}}\n\nThe Maurya and Gupta empires are called the Golden Age of India and were marked by extensive inventions and discoveries in science, technology, art, religion, and philosophy that crystallized the elements of what is generally known as Indian culture. The religions of [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]], which began in Indian sub-continent, were an important influence on South, East and Southeast Asia.\n\n[[File:Hinduism Expansion in Asia.svg|thumb|270px|Expansion of [[History of Indian influence on Southeast Asia|Hinduism in Southeast Asia]]]]\nBy 600 BCE, India had been divided into 17 regional states that would occasionally feud amongst themselves. In 327 BCE, [[Alexander the Great]] came to India with a vision of conquering the whole world. He crossed northwestern India and created the province [[Bactria]] but could not move further because his army wanted to go back to their family. Shortly prior, the soldier [[Chandragupta Maurya]] began to take control of the Ganges river and soon established the [[Maurya Empire]]. The Maurya Empire (Sanskrit: \u092e\u094c\u0930\u094d\u092f \u0930\u093e\u091c\u0935\u0902\u0936, Maurya R\u0101javan\u015bha) was the geographically extensive and powerful empire in ancient India, ruled by the Mauryan dynasty from 321 to 185 BCE. It was one of the world's largest empires in its time, stretching to the [[Himalayas]] in the north, what is now [[Assam]] in the east, probably beyond modern [[Pakistan]] in the west, and annexing [[Balochistan]] and much of what is now [[Afghanistan]], at its greatest extent. South of Mauryan empire was the [[Tamilakam]] an independent country dominated by three dynasties, the [[Pandya dynasty|Pandyans]], [[Cholas]] and [[Cheras]]. The government established by Chandragupta was led by an autocratic king, who primarily relied on the military to assert his power.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=65}} It also applied the use of a bureaucracy and even sponsored a postal service.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=65}} Chandragupta's grandson, [[Ashoka]], greatly extended the empire by conquering most of modern-day India (save for the southern tip). He eventually converted to Buddhism, though, and began a peaceful life where he promoted the religion as well as humane methods throughout India. The Maurya Empire would disintegrate soon after Ashoka's death and was conquered by the Kushan invaders from the northwest, establishing the [[Kushan Empire]]. Their conversion to Buddhism caused the religion to be associated with foreigners and therefore a decline in its popularity occurred.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=65}}\n\nThe Kushan Empire would fall apart by 220 CE, creating more political turmoil in India. Then in 320, the [[Gupta Empire]] (Sanskrit: \u0917\u0941\u092a\u094d\u0924 \u0930\u093e\u091c\u0935\u0902\u0936, Gupta R\u0101javan\u015bha) was established and covered much of the Indian Subcontinent. Founded by [[Maharaja Sri-Gupta]], the dynasty was the model of a classical civilization. Gupta kings united the area primarily through negotiation of local leaders and families as well as strategical intermarriage.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=66}} Their rule covered less land than the Maurya Empire, but established the greatest stability.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=66}} In 535, the empire ended when India was overrun by the [[Hunas]].\n\n====Classical China====\n\n=====Zhou Dynasty=====\n{{main|Zhou dynasty}}\n[[File:Zhou dynasty 1000 BC.png|thumb|Population concentration and boundaries of the [[Western Zhou]] dynasty in China]]\nSince 1029 BCE, the [[Zhou dynasty]] ({{zh|c=\u5468\u671d|p=Zh\u014du Ch\u00e1o|w=Chou Ch'ao}} {{IPA-cmn|t\u0282\u00f3\u028a t\u0282\u02b0\u0251\u030c\u028a|}}), had existed in China and it would continue to until 258 BCE.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=43}} The Zhou dynasty had been using a [[Feudalism|feudal system]] by giving power to local nobility and relying on their loyalty in order to control its large territory.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=43}} As a result, the Chinese government at this time tended to be very decentralized and weak, and there was often little the emperor could do to resolve national issues. Nonetheless, the government was able to retain its position with the creation of the [[Mandate of Heaven]], which could establish an emperor as divinely chosen to rule. The Zhou additionally discouraged the [[human sacrifice]] of the preceding eras and unified the [[Chinese language]]. Finally, the Zhou government encouraged settlers to move into the [[Yangtze|Yangtze River]] valley, thus creating the Chinese Middle Kingdom.\n\nBut by 500 BCE, its political stability began to decline due to repeated nomadic incursions{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=43}} and internal conflict derived from the fighting princes and families. This was lessened by the many philosophical movements, starting with the life of [[Confucius]]. His philosophical writings (called [[Confucianism]]) concerning the respect of elders and of the state would later be popularly used in the Han dynasty. Additionally, [[Laozi]]'s concepts of [[Taoism]], including [[yin and yang]] and the innate duality and balance of nature and the universe, became popular throughout this period. Nevertheless, the Zhou Dynasty eventually disintegrated as the local nobles began to gain more power and their conflict devolved into the [[Warring States period]], from 402 to 201 BCE.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=44}}\n\n=====Qin Dynasty=====\n{{main|Qin Dynasty}}\nOne leader eventually came on top, [[Qin Shi Huang]] ({{zh|c=\u59cb\u7687\u5e1d}}, ''Sh\u01d0 Hu\u00e1ngd\u00ec''), who overthrew the last Zhou emperor and established the Qin dynasty.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=43}} The [[Qin dynasty]] (Chinese: \u79e6\u671d; pinyin: Q\u00edn Ch\u00e1o) was the first ruling dynasty of Imperial China, lasting from 221 to 207 BCE.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=42}} The new Emperor abolished the feudal system and directly appointed a bureaucracy that would rely on him for power. Huang's imperial forces crushed any regional resistance, and they furthered the Chinese empire by expanding down to the [[South China Sea]] and northern [[Vietnam]]. Greater organization brought a uniform tax system, a national census, regulated road building (and cart width), standard measurements, standard coinage, and an official written and spoken language.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=45}} Further reforms included new irrigation projects, the encouragement of [[silk]] manufacturing,{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=45}} and (most famously) the beginning of the construction of the Great Wall of China\u2014designed to keep out the nomadic raiders who'd constantly badger the Chinese people. However, Shi Huang was infamous for his tyranny, forcing laborers to build the Wall, ordering heavy taxes, and severely punishing all who opposed him. He oppressed Confucians and promoted [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalism]], the idea that people were inherently evil, and that a strong, forceful government was needed to control them. Legalism was infused with realistic, logical views and rejected the pleasures of educated conversation as frivolous. All of this made Shi Huang extremely unpopular with the people. As the Qin began to weaken, various factions began to fight for control of China.\n\n=====Han Dynasty=====\n{{main|Han dynasty}}\n[[File:SeidenstrasseGMT.JPG|300px|thumb|The [[Silk Road]] in Asia]]\nThe [[Han dynasty]] (simplified Chinese: \u6c49\u671d; traditional Chinese: \u6f22\u671d; pinyin: H\u00e0n Ch\u00e1o; 206 BCE \u2013 220 CE) was the second imperial dynasty of China, preceded by the Qin Dynasty and succeeded by the Three Kingdoms (220\u2013265 CE). Spanning over four centuries, the period of the Han Dynasty is considered a golden age in Chinese history. One of the Han dynasty's greatest emperors, [[Emperor Wu of Han]], established a peace throughout China comparable to the [[Pax Romana]] seen in the Mediterranean a hundred years later.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=45}} To this day, China's majority ethnic group refers to itself as the \"Han people\". The Han Dynasty was established when two peasants succeeded in rising up against Shi Huang's significantly weaker successor-son. The new Han government retained the centralization and bureaucracy of the Qin, but greatly reduced the repression seen before. They expanded their territory into [[Korea]], [[Vietnam]], and [[Central Asia]], creating an even larger empire than the Qin.\n\nThe Han developed contacts with the Persian Empire in the Middle East and the Romans, through the [[Silk Road]], with which they were able to trade many commodities\u2014primarily silk. Many ancient civilizations were influenced by the [[Silk Road]], which connected China, [[India]], the Middle East and Europe. Han emperors like Wu also promoted Confucianism as the national \"religion\" (although it is debated by theologians as to whether it is defined as such or as a philosophy). Shrines devoted to Confucius were built and Confucian philosophy was taught to all scholars who entered the Chinese bureaucracy. The bureaucracy was further improved with the introduction of an examination system that selected scholars of high merit. These bureaucrats were often upper-class people educated in special schools, but whose power was often checked by the lower-class brought into the bureaucracy through their skill. The Chinese imperial bureaucracy was very effective and highly respected by all in the realm and would last over 2,000 years. The Han government was highly organized and it commanded the military, judicial law (which used a system of courts and strict laws), agricultural production, the economy, and the general lives of its people. The government also promoted intellectual philosophy, scientific research, and detailed historical records.\n\nHowever, despite all of this impressive stability, central power began to lose control by the turn of the [[Common Era]]. As the Han Dynasty declined, many factors continued to pummel it into submission until China was left in a state of chaos. By 100 CE, philosophical activity slowed, and corruption ran rampant in the bureaucracy. Local landlords began to take control as the scholars neglected their duties, and this resulted in heavy taxation of the peasantry. Taoists began to gain significant ground and protested the decline. They started to proclaim magical powers and promised to save China with them; the Taoist [[Yellow Turban Rebellion]] in 184 (led by rebels in yellow scarves) failed but was able to weaken the government. The aforementioned Huns combined with diseases killed up to half of the population and officially ended the Han dynasty by 220. The ensuing period of chaos was so terrible it lasted for three centuries, where many weak regional rulers and dynasties failed to establish order in China. This period of chaos and attempts at order is commonly known as that of the [[Six Dynasties]]. The first part of this included the [[Three Kingdoms]] which started in 220 and describes the brief and weak successor \"dynasties\" that followed the Han. In 265, the [[Jin dynasty (265\u2013420)|Jin dynasty]] of China was started and this soon split into two different empires in control of northwestern and southeastern China. In 420, the conquest and abdication of those two dynasties resulted in the first of the [[Southern and Northern Dynasties]]. The Northern and Southern Dynasties passed through until finally, by 557, the [[Northern Zhou|Northern Zhou dynasty]] ruled the north and the [[Chen dynasty]] ruled the south.\n\n==Medieval{{anchor|Medieval}}==\nDuring this period, the [[Eastern world]] empires continued to expand through trade, migration and conquests of neighboring areas. Gunpowder was widely used as early as the 11th century and they were using moveable type printing five hundred years before Gutenberg created his press. Buddhism, Taoism, Confucianism were the dominant philosophies of the Far East during the Middle Ages. Marco Polo was not the first Westerner to travel to the Orient and return with amazing stories of this different culture, but his accounts published in the late 13th and early 14th centuries were the first to be widely read throughout Europe.\n\n===Western Asia (Middle East)===\n{{main|Medieval Middle East}}\n[[File:Byzantine and Sassanid Empires in 600 CE.png|thumb|right|310px|Byzantine and Sassanian Empires in 600 AD]]\nThe Arabian peninsula and the surrounding [[Middle East]] and [[Near East]] regions saw dramatic change during the Medieval era caused primarily by the spread of [[Islam]] and the establishment of the Arabian Empires.\n\nIn the 5th century, the Middle East was separated into small, weak states; the two most prominent were the [[Sassanian Empire]] of the [[History of Iran|Persians]] in what is now [[Iran]] and [[Iraq]], and the Byzantine Empire in [[Anatolia]] (modern-day [[Turkey]]). The Byzantines and Sassanians fought with each other continually, a reflection of the rivalry between the Roman Empire and the Persian Empire seen during the previous five hundred years. The fighting weakened both states, leaving the stage open to a new power. Meanwhile, the nomadic [[Bedouin]] tribes who dominated the Arabian desert saw a period of tribal stability, greater trade networking and a familiarity with Abrahamic religions or monotheism.\n\nWhile the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] Roman and [[Sassanian Empire|Sassanid]] Persian empires were both weakened by the [[Byzantine\u2013Sasanian War of 602\u2013628]], a new power in the form of [[Islam]] grew in the Middle East under [[Muhammad in Medina]]. In a series of rapid [[Muslim conquests]], the [[Rashidun army]], led by the [[Caliph]]s and skilled military commanders such as [[Khalid ibn al-Walid]], swept through most of the Middle East, taking more than half of Byzantine territory in the [[Arab\u2013Byzantine wars]] and completely engulfing Persia in the [[Muslim conquest of Persia]]. It would be the Arab [[Caliphate]]s of the [[Middle Ages]] that would first unify the entire Middle East as a distinct region and create the dominant [[Arab|ethnic identity]] that persists today. These Caliphates included the [[Rashidun Caliphate]], [[Umayyad Caliphate]], [[Abbasid Caliphate]], and later the [[Seljuq Empire]].\n\n[[File:Caliphate 750.jpg|thumb|270px|The [[early Muslim conquests]], 622\u2013750]]\nAfter Muhammad introduced Islam, it jump-started Middle Eastern culture into an [[Islamic Golden Age]], inspiring achievements in [[architecture]], the revival of old advances in science and technology, and the formation of a distinct way of life. Muslims saved and spread Greek advances in [[History of medicine|medicine]], [[History of elementary algebra|algebra]], [[History of geometry|geometry]], [[History of astronomy|astronomy]], [[History of anatomy|anatomy]], and [[History of ethics|ethics]] that would later finds it way back to Western Europe.\n\nThe dominance of the Arabs came to a sudden end in the mid-11th century with the arrival of the [[Seljuq Turks]], migrating south from the Turkic homelands in Central Asia. They conquered Persia, Iraq (capturing Baghdad in 1055), Syria, Palestine, and the [[Hejaz]]. This was followed by a series of Christian Western Europe invasions. The fragmentation of the Middle East allowed joined forces, mainly from England, France, and the emerging [[Holy Roman Empire]], to enter the region. In 1099 the knights of the [[First Crusade]] captured [[Jerusalem]] and founded the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]], which survived until 1187, when [[Saladin]] retook the city. Smaller crusader fiefdoms survived until 1291. In the early 13th century, a new wave of invaders, the armies of the [[Mongol Empire]], swept through the region, sacking Baghdad in the [[Siege of Baghdad (1258)]] and advancing as far south as the border of [[Egypt]] in what became known as the [[Mongol conquests]]. The Mongols eventually retreated in 1335, but the chaos that ensued throughout the empire deposed the Seljuq Turks. In 1401, the region was further plagued by the Turko-Mongol, [[Timur]], and his ferocious raids. By then, another group of Turks had arisen as well, the [[Ottoman Turks|Ottomans]].\n\n===Central Asia===\n{{main|Medieval Central Asia}}\n\n====Mongol Empire====\n[[Image:Mongolia 1500 AD.jpg|thumb|300px|The [[Turco-Mongol tradition|Turco-Mongol]] residual states and domains by the 15th century]]\nThe [[Mongol Empire]] conquered a large part of Asia in the 13th century, an area extending from China to Europe. Medieval Asia was the kingdom of the Khans. Never before had any person controlled as much land as [[Genghis Khan]]. He built his power unifying separate Mongol tribes before expanding his kingdom south and west. He and his grandson, Kublai Khan, controlled lands in China, Burma, Central Asia, Russia, Iran, the Middle East, and Eastern Europe. Estimates are that the Mongol armies reduced the population of China by nearly a third. Genghis Khan was a pagan who tolerated nearly every religion, and their culture often suffered the harshest treatment from Mongol armies. The Khan armies pushed as far west as Jerusalem before being defeated in 1260.\n\n===South Asia/Indian Subcontinent===\n====India====\n{{main|Medieval India}}\n[[File:Delhi Sultanate map.png|thumb|right|320px|The [[Delhi Sultanate]].]]\n\nThe Indian early medieval age, 600 to 1200, is defined by regional kingdoms and cultural diversity. When [[Harsha]] of [[Kannauj]], who ruled much of the Indo-Gangetic Plain from 606 to 647, attempted to expand southwards, he was defeated by the [[Chalukya dynasty|Chalukya]] ruler of the Deccan. When his successor attempted to expand eastwards, he was defeated by the [[Pala Empire|Pala]] king of [[Bengal]]. When the Chalukyas attempted to expand southwards, they were defeated by the [[Pallava]]s from farther south, who in turn were opposed by the [[Pandyas]] and the [[Cholas]] from still farther south. The Cholas could under the rule of [[Raja Raja Chola]] defeat their rivals and rise to a regional power. Cholas expanded northward and defeated [[Eastern Chalukya]], [[Eastern Ganga dynasty|Kalinga]] and the [[Pala Empire|Pala]]. Under [[Rajendra Chola]] the Cholas created the first notable navy of Indian subcontinent. The [[Chola navy]] extended the influence of Chola empire to [[southeast asia]]. During this time, pastoral peoples whose land had been cleared to make way for the growing agricultural economy were accommodated within caste society, as were new non-traditional ruling classes.<ref>{{citation|last=Stein|first=B.|author-link=Burton Stein|date=1998|title=A History of India|edition=1st|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|place=Oxford|isbn=978-0-631-20546-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SXdVS0SzQSAC|pages=119\u2013122}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Muslim conquest in the Indian subcontinent]] mainly took place from the 12th century onwards, though earlier Muslim conquests include the limited inroads into modern Afghanistan and Pakistan and the Umayyad campaigns in India, during the time of the Rajput kingdoms in the 8th century.\n\nMajor economic and military powers like the [[Delhi Sultanate]] and [[Bengal Sultanate]], were seen to be established. The search of their wealth led the [[Voyages of Christopher Columbus]].\n\n===East Asia===\n{{main|History of East Asia}}\n\n====China====\n{{main|Medieval China}}\nChina saw the rise and fall of the Sui, Tang, Song, and Yuan dynasties and therefore improvements in its bureaucracy, the spread of [[Buddhism]], and the advent of [[Neo-Confucianism]]. It was an unsurpassed era for Chinese ceramics and painting. Medieval architectural masterpieces the Great South Gate in Todaiji, Japan, and the Tien-ning Temple in Peking, China are some of the surviving constructs from this era.\n\n=====Sui Dynasty=====\n{{main|Sui dynasty}}\nA new powerful dynasty began to rise in the 580s, amongst the divided factions of China. This was started when an aristocrat named Yang Jian married his daughter into the Northern Zhou dynasty. He proclaimed himself [[Emperor Wen of Sui]] and appeased the nomadic military by abandoning the Confucian scholar-gentry. Emperor Wen soon led the conquest of the southern Chen Dynasty and united China once more under the [[Sui dynasty]]. The emperor lowered taxes and constructed granaries that he used to prevent famine and control the market. Later Wen's son would murder him for the throne and declare himself [[Emperor Yang of Sui]]. Emperor Yang revived the Confucian scholars and the bureaucracy, much to anger of the aristocrats and nomadic military leaders. Yang became an excessive leader who overused China's resources for personal luxury and perpetuated exhaustive attempts to conquer Goguryeo. His military failures and neglect of the empire forced his own ministers to assassinate him in 618, ending the Sui Dynasty.\n\n=====Tang dynasty=====\n{{main|Tang dynasty}}\n[[File:Battle of Talas.png|thumb|380px|[[Battle of Talas]] between Tang dynasty and [[Abbasid Caliphate]] c. 751]]\n\nFortunately, one of Yang's most respectable advisors, Li Yuan, was able to claim the throne quickly, preventing a chaotic collapse. He proclaimed himself [[Emperor Gaozu of Tang|Emperor Gaozu]], and established the [[Tang dynasty]] in 623. The Tang saw expansion of China through conquest to Tibet in the west, [[Vietnam]] in the south, and Manchuria in the north. Tang emperors also improved the education of scholars in the Chinese bureaucracy. A Ministry of Rites was established and the examination system was improved to better qualify scholars for their jobs.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=270|loc=Chapter 12|quote=In the Tang and Song periods, the examination system was greatly expanded, and the pattern of advancement in the civil service was much more regularized. This meant that in the political realm more than any previous political system (and those yet to come for centuries), the Chinese connected merit as measured by tested skills with authority and status.}} In addition, Buddhism became popular in China with two different strains between the peasantry and the elite, the [[Pure Land Buddhism|Pure Land]] and [[Zen]] strains, respectively.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|pages=271\u2013272|loc=Chapter 12|quote=Among the masses, the salvationist pure land strain of Mahayana Buddhism won widespread conversions because it seemed to provide a refuge from an age of war and turmoil. Members of the elite class, on the other hand, were more attracted to the Chan variant of Buddhism, or Zen as it is known in Japan and the West.}} Greatly supporting the spread of Buddhism was [[Wu Zetian|Empress Wu]], who additionally claimed an unofficial \"Zhou dynasty\" and displayed China's tolerance of a woman ruler, which was rare at the time. However, Buddhism would also experience some backlash, especially from Confucianists and Taoists. This would usually involve criticism about how it was costing the state money, since the government was unable to tax Buddhist monasteries, and additionally sent many grants and gifts to them.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=273|loc=Chapter 12|quote=Because monastic lands and resources were not taxed, the Tang regime lost huge amounts of revenue as a result of imperial grants or the gifts of wealthy families to Buddhist monasteries.}}\n\nThe Tang dynasty began to decline under the rule of [[Emperor Xuanzong of Tang|Emperor Xuanzong]], who began to neglect the economy and military and caused unrest amongst the court officials due to the excessive influence of his concubine, [[Yang Guifei]], and her family.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=274|loc=Chapter 12|quote=The arrogance and excessive ambition of Yang Guifei and her family angered members of the rival cliques at court, who took every opportunity to turn Yang's excesses into a cause for popular unreast.}} This eventually sparked a revolt in 755.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=274|loc=Chapter 12|quote=The deepening crisis came to a head in 755 when one of [Xuanzong]'s main military leaders&nbsp;... led a widely supported revolt with the aim of founding a new dynasty to supplant the Tang.}} Although the revolt failed, subduing it required involvement with the unruly nomadic tribes outside of China and distributing more power to local leaders\u2014leaving the government and economy in a degraded state. The Tang dynasty officially ended in 907 and various factions led by the aforementioned nomadic tribes and local leaders would fight for control of China in the [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period]].\n\n=====Liao, Song and Jin dynasties=====\n{{main|Liao dynasty|Song dynasty|Jin dynasty (1115\u20131234)}}\nBy 960, most of China proper had been reunited under the [[Song dynasty]], although it lost territories in the north and could not defeat one of the nomadic tribes there\u2014the [[Liao dynasty]] of the highly sinicized [[Khitan people]]. From then on, the Song would have to pay tribute to avoid invasion and thus set the precedent for other nomadic kingdoms to oppress them. The Song also saw the revival of Confucianism in the form of [[Neo-Confucianism]]. This had the effect of putting the Confucian scholars at a higher status than aristocrats or Buddhists and also intensified the reduction of power in women. The infamous practice of [[foot binding]] developed in this period as a result. Eventually the Liao dynasty in the north was overthrown by the [[Jin dynasty (1115\u20131234)|Jin dynasty]] of the Manchu-related [[Jurchen people]]. The new Jin kingdom [[Jin\u2013Song Wars|invaded northern China]], leaving the Song to flee farther south and creating the [[Southern Song dynasty]] in 1126. There, cultural life flourished.\n\n=====Yuan Dynasty=====\n{{main|Yuan dynasty}}\n [[File:Route of Marco Polo.png|thumb|380px|Map of Marco Polo's travels]]\nBy 1227, the Mongols had conquered the [[Western Xia]] kingdom northwest of China. Soon the Mongols incurred upon the Jin empire of the Jurchens. Chinese cities were soon besieged by the Mongol hordes that showed little mercy for those who resisted and the Southern Song Chinese were quickly losing territory. In 1271 the current great khan, [[Kublai Khan]], claimed himself Emperor of China and officially established the Yuan Dynasty. By 1290, all of China was under control of the Mongols, marking the first time they were ever completely conquered by a foreign invader; the new capital was established at [[Khanbaliq]] (modern-day [[Beijing]]). Kublai Khan segregated Mongol culture from Chinese culture by discouraging interactions between the two peoples, separating living spaces and places of worship, and reserving top administrative positions to Mongols, thus preventing Confucian scholars to continue the bureaucratic system. Nevertheless, Kublai remained fascinated with Chinese thinking, surrounding himself with Chinese Buddhist, Taoist, or Confucian advisors.\n\nMongol women displayed a contrasting independent nature compared to the Chinese women who continued to be suppressed. Mongol women often rode out on hunts or even to war. Kublai's wife, [[Chabi]], was a perfect example of this; Chabi advised her husband on several political and diplomatic matters; she convinced him that the Chinese were to be respected and well-treated in order to make them easier to rule.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=327|loc=Chapter 14|quote=[Chabi] convinced Kubilai that the harsh treatment of the survivors of the defeated Song imperial family would only anger the peoples of north China and make them more difficult to rule.}} However this was not enough to affect Chinese women's position, and the increasingly Neo-Confucian successors of Kublai further repressed Chinese and even Mongol women.\n\nThe Black Death, which would later ravage Western Europe, had its beginnings in Asia, where it wiped out large populations in China in 1331.\n\n====Korea====\n{{main|Medieval Korea}}\n\n====[[Three Kingdoms of Korea]]====\n[[File:History of Korea-476.PNG|thumb|left|Korean peninsula in 476 AD. There are three kingdoms and Gaya Union in the picture. This picture shows the heyday of [[Goguryeo]]]]\nThe three Kingdoms of Korea involves [[Goguryeo]] in north, [[Baekje]] in southwest, and [[Silla]] in southeast Korean peninsula. These three kingdoms were like a bridge of cultures between China and Japan. Thanks to them, Japan was able to accept Chinese splendid cultures. [[Prince Sh\u014dtoku]] of Japan had been taught by two teachers. One was from [[Baekje]], the other was from [[Goguryeo]]. Once Japan invaded [[Silla]], Goguryeo helped Silla to defeat Japan. [[Baekje]] met the earliest heyday of them. Its heyday was the 5th century AD. Its capital was [[Seoul]]. During its heyday, the kingdom made colonies overseas. Liaodong, China and Kyushu, Japan were the colonies of [[Baekje]] during its short heyday. [[Goguryeo]] was the strongest kingdom of all. They sometimes called themselves  as an Empire. Its heyday was 6th century. King Gwanggaeto widened its territory  to north. So Goguryeo dominated from Korean peninsula to Manchuria. And his son, [[Jangsu of Goguryeo|King Jangsu]] widened its territory to south. He occupied [[Seoul]], and moved its capital to [[Pyeongyang]]. Goguryeo almost occupied three quarters of South Korean peninsula thanks to king Jangsu who widened the kingdom's territory to south. [[Silla]] met the latest heyday. King Jinheung went north and occupied[[Seoul]]. But it was short. [[Baekje]] became stronger and attacked Silla. Baekje occupied more than 40 cities of Silla. So Silla could hardly survive.\nChina's Sui dynasty invaded [[Goguryeo]] and [[Goguryeo\u2013Sui War]] occurs between Korea and China. [[Goguryeo]] won against China and [[Sui dynasty]] fell. After then, [[Tang dynasty]] reinvaded [[Goguryeo]] and helped [[Silla]] to unify the peninsula. Because Silla was the weakest of all, so it asked Tang for help. [[Goguryeo]], [[Baekje]], and Japan helped each other against Tang-Silla alliance, but [[Baekje]] and [[Goguryeo]] fell. Unfortunately, [[Tang dynasty]] betrayed [[Silla]] in order to occupy the whole Korean peninsula. During the [[Silla-Tang war]], people of fallen Baekje and Goguryeo helped Silla against Chinese invasion, so Silla could beat China and unified the peninsula. This war helped Korean people to unite mentally.\n=====North-South States Period=====\n[[File:History of Korea-Inter-country Age-830 CE.gif|thumb|left|[[Balhae]] in the north, [[Later Silla]] in the south]]\n[[File:Korea - Seoul - National Museum - Incense Burner 0252-06a.jpg|thumb|right|the [[Goryeo ware]], which shows splendid culture of [[Goryeo]] in mediaeval Korea.]]\n\nThe rest of [[Goguryeo]] people established [[Balhae]] and won the war against Tang in later 7th century AD. [[Balhae]] is the north state, and [[Later Silla]] was the south state. Balhae was a quite strong kingdom as their ancestor Goguryeo did. Finally, the Emperor of Tang dynasty admits Balhae as 'A strong country in the East'. They liked to trade with Japan, China, and Silla. Balhae and Later Silla sent a lot of international students to China. And Arabian merchants came into Korean peninsula, so Korea became known as 'Silla' in the western countries. Silla improved Korean writing system called Idu letters. Idu affected [[Katakana]] of Japan. [[Liao dynasty]] invaded [[Balhae]] in early 10th century, so [[Balhae]] fell.\n\n=====Later Three Kingdoms of Korea=====\nThe unified Korean kingdom, Later Silla divided into three kingdoms again because of the corrupt central government. It involves [[Later Goguryeo]](also as known as \"Taebong\"), [[Later Baekje]], and Later Silla. The general of [[Later Goguryeo]], Wang Geon took the thrown and  changed its name into [[Goryeo]], which was derived by the old strong kingdom, Goguryeo, and Goryeo reunified the peninsula.\n\n=====Goryeo(918~1392)=====\n{{main|Goryeo}}\n[[File:Goryo Taejo Wangkun 2.jpg|thumb|left|The first King of [[Goryeo]], as known as [[Taejo of Goryeo]](918~943)]]\n[[Goryeo]] reunited the Korean peninsula during the later three kingdoms period and named itself as 'Empire'. But nowadays, Goryeo is known as a kingdom. The name 'Goryeo' was derived from [[Goguryeo]], and the name [[Korea]] was derived from Goryeo. Goryeo adopted people from fallen [[Balhae]]. They also widened their territory to north by defending Liao dynasty and attacking the [[Jurchen people]]. Goryeo developed a splendid culture. The first metal type printed book [[Jikji]] was also from Korea. The [[Goryeo ware]] is one of the most famous legacies of this kingdom. Goryeo imported Chinese government system and developed into their own ways.\n\nDuring this period, laws were codified and a civil service system was introduced. Buddhism flourished and spread throughout the peninsula. The [[Tripitaka Koreana]] is 81,258 books total. It was made to keep Korea safe against the Mongolian invasion. It is now a UNESCO world heritage. Goryeo won the battle against [[Liao dynasty]]. Then, the [[Mongolian Empire]] invaded Goryeo. Goryeo did not disappear but it had to obey Mongolians. After 80 years, in 14th century, the Mongolian dynasty Yuan lose power, King Gongmin tried to free themselves against Mongol although his wife was also Mongolian. At the 14th century, [[Ming dynasty]] want Goryeo to obey China. But Goryeo didn't. They decided to invade China. Going to China, the general of Goryeo, Lee Sung-Gae came back and destroyed Goryeo and established new dynasty, [[Joseon]]. And he became [[Taejo of Joseon]], which means the first king of [[Joseon]].\n\n\n====Japan====\n{{main|Medieval Japan}}\n[[File:Shotoku Taishi.jpg|thumb|left|Sculpture of [[Prince Sh\u014dtoku]]]]\n\n=====Asuka period=====\nJapan's medieval history began with the [[Asuka period]], from around 600 to 710. The time was characterized by the [[Taika Reform]] and imperial centralization, both of which were a direct result of growing Chinese contact and influences. In 603, [[Prince Sh\u014dtoku]] of the [[Imperial House of Japan|Yamato dynasty]] began significant political and cultural changes. He issued the [[Seventeen-article constitution]] in 604, centralizing power towards the emperor (under the title ''tenno'', or heavenly sovereign) and removing the power to levy taxes from provincial lords. Sh\u014dtoku was also a patron of Buddhism and he encouraged building temples competitively.{{sfn|Bowman|2000|pages=124\u2013137}}\n\n=====Nara period=====\nSh\u014dtoku's reforms transitioned Japan to the [[Nara period]] (c. 710 to c. 794), with the moving of the Japanese capital to [[Nara, Nara|Nara]] in [[Honshu]]. This period saw the culmination of Chinese-style writing, etiquette, and architecture in Japan along with Confucian ideals{{sfn|Stearns|Adas|Schwartz|Gilbert|2011|pages=291\u2013301}} to supplement the already present Buddhism. Peasants revered both Confucian scholars and Buddhist monks. However, in the wake of the [[735\u2013737 Japanese smallpox epidemic]], Buddhism gained the status of state religion and the government ordered the construction of numerous Buddhist temples, monasteries, and statues.{{sfn|Bowman|2000|pages=124\u2013137}} The lavish spending combined with the fact that many aristocrats did not pay taxes, put a heavy burden on peasantry that caused poverty and famine.{{sfn|Bowman|2000|pages=124\u2013137}} Eventually the Buddhist position got out of control, threatening to seize imperial power and causing [[Emperor Kanmu]] to move the capital to [[Heian-ky\u014d]] to avoid a Buddhist takeover.{{sfn|Stearns|Adas|Schwartz|Gilbert|2011|pages=291\u2013301}} This marked the beginning of the [[Heian period]] and the end of Taika reform.\n\n=====Heian period=====\nWith the Heian period (from 794 to 1185) came a decline of imperial power. Chinese influence also declined, as a result of its correlation with imperial centralization and the [[Mandate of Heaven|heavenly mandate]], which came to be regarded as ineffective. By 838, the Japanese court discontinued its embassies in China; only traders and Buddhist monks continued to travel to China. Buddhism itself came to be considered more Japanese than Chinese, and persisted to be popular in Japan. Buddhists monks and monasteries continued their attempts to gather personal power in courts, along with aristocrats. One particular noble family that dominated influence in the imperial bureaucracy was the [[Fujiwara clan]]. During this time cultural life in the imperial court flourished. There was a focus on beauty and social interaction and writing and literature was considered refined. Noblewomen were cultured the same as noblemen, dabbling in creative works and politics. A prime example of both Japanese literature and women's role in high-class culture at this time was ''[[The Tale of Genji]]'', written by the [[lady-in-waiting]] [[Murasaki Shikibu]]. Popularization of wooden palaces and [[sh\u014dji]] sliding doors amongst the nobility also occurred.\n\nLoss of imperial power also led to the rise of provincial warrior elites. Small lords began to function independently. They administered laws, supervised public works projects, and collected revenue for themselves instead of the imperial court. Regional lords also began to build their own armies. These warriors were loyal only their local lords and not the emperor, although the imperial government increasingly called them in to protect the capital. The regional warrior class developed into the [[samurai]], which created its own culture: including specialized weapons such as the [[katana]] and a form of chivalry, [[bushido]]. The imperial government's loss of control in the second half of the Heian period allowed banditry to grow, requiring both feudal lords and Buddhist monasteries to procure warriors for protection. As imperial control over Japan declined, feudal lords also became more independent and seceded from the empire. These feudal states squandered the peasants living in them, reducing the farmers to an almost [[serfdom]] status. Peasants were also rigidly restricted from rising to the samurai class, being physically set off by dress and weapon restrictions. As a result of their oppression, many peasants turned to Buddhism as a hope for reward in the afterlife for upright behavior.{{sfn|Stearns|Adas|Schwartz|Gilbert|2011|pages=296}}\n\nWith the increase of feudalism, families in the imperial court began to depend on alliances with regional lords. The Fujiwara clan declined from power, replaced by a rivalry between the [[Taira clan]] and the [[Minamoto clan]]. This rivalry grew into the [[Genpei War]] in the early 1180s. This war saw the use of both samurai and peasant soldiers. For the samurai, battle was ritual and they often easily cut down the poorly trained peasantry. The Minamoto clan proved successful due to their rural alliances. Once the Taira was destroyed, the Minamoto established a military government called the [[shogunate]] (or bakufu), centered in [[Kamakura, Kanagawa|Kamakura]].\n\n=====Kamakura period=====\nThe end of the Genpei War and the establishment of the [[Kamakura shogunate]] marked the end of the Heian period and the beginning of the [[Kamakura period]] in 1185, solidifying feudal Japan.\n\n\n===Southeast Asia===\n{{main|Medieval Southeast Asia}}\n\n==Early modern==\n{{further|Early modern period}}\n[[File:Modern Asia (1796).tif|thumb|245px|A 1796 map of Asia (or the \"[[Eastern world]]\"), which also included the continent of [[Australia]] (then known as [[New Holland (Australia)|New Holland]]) within its realm.]]\nThe [[Russian Empire]] began to expand into Asia from the 17th century, and would eventually take control of all of [[Siberia]] and most of Central Asia by the end of the 19th century. The [[Ottoman Empire]] controlled Anatolia, the Middle East, North Africa and the Balkans from the 16th century onwards. In the 17th century, the [[Manchu people|Manchu]] conquered China and established the [[Qing Dynasty]]. In the 16th century, the [[Mughal Empire]] controlled much of India and initiated the second golden age for India. China was the largest economy in the world for much of the time, followed by India until the 18th century.\n\n===Ming China===\n\nBy 1368, [[Zhu Yuanzhang]] had claimed himself [[Hongwu Emperor]] and established the Ming dynasty of China. Immediately, the new emperor and his followers drove the Mongols and their culture out of China and beyond the Great Wall.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=503|loc=Chapter 22|quote=Immediately after he seized the throne, Zhu launched an effort to rid China of all traces of the \"barbarian\" Mongols. Mongol dress was discarded, Mongol names were dropped by those who had adopted them and were removed from buildings and court records, and Mongol palaces and administrative buildings in some areas were raided and sacked. The nomads themselves fled or were driven beyond the Great Wall, where military expeditions pursued them on several occasions.}} The new emperor was somewhat suspicious of the scholars that dominated China's bureaucracy, for he had been born a peasant and was uneducated.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=503|loc=Chapter 22|quote=Because the Hongwu emperor, like the founder of the earlier Han dynasty, was from a peasant family and thus poorly educated, he viewed the scholar-gentry with some suspicion.}} Nevertheless, Confucian scholars were necessary to China's bureaucracy and were reestablished as well as reforms that would improve the exam systems and make them more important in entering the bureaucracy than ever before. The exams became more rigorous, cut down harshly on cheating, and those who excelled were more highly appraised. Finally, Hongwu also directed more power towards the role of emperor so as to end the corrupt influences of the bureaucrats.\n\n====Society and economy====\nThe Hongwu emperor, perhaps for his sympathy of the common-folk, had built many irrigation systems and other public projects that provided help for the peasant farmers.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=504|loc=Chapter 22|quote=Perhaps because his lowly origins and personal suffering made him sensitive to the plight of the peasantry, Hongwu introduced measures that would improve the lot of the common people. Like most strong emperors, he promoted public works projects, including dike building and the extension of irrigation systems aimed at improving the farmers' yields.}} They were also allowed to cultivate and claim unoccupied land without having to pay any taxes and labor demands were lowered.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=504|loc=Chapter 22|quote=... Hongwu decreed that unoccupied lands would become the tax-exempt property of those who cleared and cultivated them. He lowered forced labor demands on the peasantry by both the government and members of the gentry class.}} However, none of this was able to stop the rising landlord class that gained many privileges from the government and slowly gained control of the peasantry. Moneylenders foreclosed on peasant debt in exchange for mortgages and bought up farmer land, forcing them to become the landlords' tenants or to wander elsewhere for work.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=505|loc=Chapter 22}} Also during this time, [[Neo-Confucianism]] intensified even more than the previous two dynasties (the Song and Yuan). Focus on the superiority of elders over youth, men over women, and teachers over students resulted in minor discrimination of the \"inferior\" classes. The fine arts grew in the Ming era, with improved techniques in brush painting that depicted scenes of court, city or country life; people such as scholars or travelers; or the beauty of mountains, lakes, or marshes. The Chinese novel fully developed in this era, with such classics written such as ''[[Water Margin]]'', ''[[Journey to the West]]'', and ''[[Jin Ping Mei]]''.\n\nEconomics grew rapidly in the Ming Dynasty as well. The introduction of American crops such as [[maize]], [[sweet potatoes]], and [[peanut]]s allowed for cultivation of crops in infertile land and helped prevent famine. The population boom that began in the Song dynasty accelerated until China's population went from 80 or 90 million to 150 million in three centuries, culminating in 1600.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=507|loc=Chapter 22|quote=By 1600 the population of China had risen to as many as 150 million from 80 to 90 million in the 14th century.}} This paralleled the market economy that was growing both internally and externally. Silk, tea, ceramics, and lacquer-ware were produced by artisans that traded them in Asia and to Europeans. Westerners began to trade (with some Chinese-assigned limits), primarily in the port-towns of [[Macau]] and [[Guangzhou|Canton]]. Although merchants benefited greatly from this, land remained the primary symbol of wealth in China and traders' riches were often put into acquiring more land.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=507|loc=Chapter 22|quote=Much of the merchants' wealth was invested in land rather than plowed back into trade or manufacturing, because land owning, not commerce, remained the surest route to social status in China.}} Therefore, little of these riches were used in private enterprises that could've allowed for China to develop the [[market economy]] that often accompanied the highly-successful Western countries.\n\n====Foreign interests====\n[[File:Fort St. George, Chennai.jpg|thumb|left|A view of the [[Fort St George]] in 18th-century [[Madras]].]]\nIn the interest of national glory, the Chinese began sending impressive [[Junk (ship)|junk]] ships across the [[South China Sea]] and the [[Indian Ocean]]. From 1403 to 1433, the [[Yongle Emperor]] commissioned [[Treasure voyages|expeditions]] led by the admiral [[Zheng He]], a Muslim [[eunuch]] from China. Chinese junks carrying hundreds of soldiers, goods, and animals for zoos, traveled to Southeast Asia, Persia, southern Arabia, and east Africa to show off Chinese power. Their prowess exceeded that of current Europeans at the time, and had these expeditions not ended, the world economy may be different from today.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=339|loc=Chapter 15|quote=There is no question that the course of world history might have been changed dramatically had the Chinese thrust continued, for the tiny European expeditions that began to creep down the western coast of Africa at about the same time would have been no match for this combination of merchant and military organization.}} In 1433, the Chinese government decided that the cost of a navy was an unnecessary expense. The Chinese navy was slowly dismantled and focus on interior reform and military defense began. It was China's longstanding priority that they protect themselves from nomads and they have accordingly returned to it. The growing limits on the Chinese navy would leave them vulnerable to foreign invasion by sea later on.\n\n[[File:Schall-von-bell.jpg|thumb|Here a Jesuit, Adam Schall von Bell (1592\u20131666), is dressed as an official of the Chinese Department of Astronomy.]]\n\nAs was inevitable, Westerners arrived on the Chinese east coast, primarily [[Jesuit]] missionaries which reached the mainland in 1582. They attempted to [[Jesuit China missions|convert the Chinese people to Christianity]] by first converting the top of the social hierarchy and allowing the lower classes to subsequently convert. To further gain support, many Jesuits adopted Chinese dress, customs, and language.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=508|loc=Chapter 22|quote=The Jesuits believed that the best way to convert a great civilization such as China was to adopt the dress, customs, language and manners of its elite.}} Some Chinese scholars were interested in certain Western teachings and especially in Western technology. By the 1580s, Jesuit scholars like [[Matteo Ricci]] and [[Adam Schall]] amazed the Chinese elite with technological advances such as European clocks, improved calendars and cannons, and the accurate prediction of eclipses.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=508|loc=Chapter 22|quote=Beginning in the 1580s, a succession of brilliant Jesuit scholars ... spent most of their time in the imperial city, correcting faulty calendars, forging cannons, fixing clocks imported from Europe, and astounding the Chinese scholar-gentry with the accuracy of their instruments and their ability to predict eclipses.}} Although some the scholar-gentry converted, many were suspicious of the Westerners whom they called \"barbarians\" and even resented them for the embarrassment they received at the hand of Western correction. Nevertheless, a small group of Jesuit scholars remained at the court to impress the emperor and his advisors.\n\n====Decline====\n[[Image:Batavia, C. de Jonghe (1740).jpg|thumb|left|Dutch Batavia in the 17th century, built in what is now [[North Jakarta]]]]\n\nNear the end of the 1500s, the extremely centralized government that gave so much power to the emperor had begun to fail as more incompetent rulers took the mantle. Along with these weak rulers came increasingly corrupt officials who took advantage of the decline. Once more the public projects fell into disrepair due to neglect by the bureaucracy and resulted in floods, drought, and famine that rocked the peasantry. The famine soon became so terrible that some peasants resorted to selling their children to slavery to save them from starvation, or to eating bark, the feces of geese, or [[Cannibalism|other people]].{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=509|loc=Chapter 22|quote=Peasants in afflicted districts were reduced to eating the bark from trees or the excrement of wild geese. Some peasants sold their children into slavery to keep them from starving, and peasants in some areas resorted to cannibalism.}} Many landlords abused the situation by building large estates where desperate farmers would work and be exploited. In turn, many of these farmers resorted to flight, banditry, and open rebellion.\n\nAll of this corresponded with the usual dynastic decline of China seen before, as well as the growing foreign threats. In the mid-16th century, Japanese and ethnic Chinese pirates began to raid the southern coast, and neither the bureaucracy nor the military were able to stop them.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=510|loc=Chapter 22|quote=One of the early signs of the seriousness of imperial deterioration was the inability of Chinese bureaucrats and military forces to put an end to the epidemic of Japanese (and ethnic Chinese) pirate attacks that ravaged the southern coast in the mid-16th century.}} The threat of the northern [[Manchu people]] also grew. The Manchu were an already large state north of China, when in the early 17th century a local leader named [[Nurhaci]] suddenly united them under the [[Eight Banners]]\u2014armies that the opposing families were organized into. The Manchus adopted many Chinese customs, specifically taking after their bureaucracy. Nevertheless, the Manchus still remained a Chinese [[vassal]]. In 1644 Chinese administration became so weak, the 16th and last emperor, the [[Chongzhen Emperor]], did not respond to the severity of an ensuing rebellion by local dissenters until the enemy had invaded the [[Forbidden City]] (his personal estate). He soon hanged himself in the imperial gardens.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=510|loc=Chapter 22|quote=By [1644], the administrative apparatus had become so feeble that the last Ming emperor, Chongzhen, did not realize how serious the rebel advance was until enemy soldiers were scaling the walls of the forbidden city. ... the ill-fated Chongzhen retreated to the imperial gardens and hanged himself rather than face capture.}} For a brief amount of time, the [[Shun dynasty]] was claimed, until a loyalist Ming official called support from the Manchus to put down the new dynasty. The Shun Dynasty ended within a year and the Manchu were now within the Great Wall. Taking advantage of the situation, the Manchus marched on the Chinese capital of Beijing. [[Manchu conquest of China|Within two decades]] all of China belonged to the Manchu and the [[Qing dynasty]] was established.\n===Korea: Joseon dynasty(1392~1897)===\n{{Main|Joseon}}\n[[File:Gyeongbokgung-Gyeonghoeru-02.jpg|thumb|left|Gyeonghoeru of [[Gyeongbokgung]], the [[Joseon]] dynasty's royal palace.]]\nIn early-modern Korea, the 500-year-old kingdom, [[Goryeo]] fell and new dynasty [[Joseon]] rose in August 5th, 1392. [[Taejo of Joseon]] changed the country's name from [[Goryeo]] to [[Joseon]]. The fourth king, [[Sejong the Great]] created [[Hangul]], the Korean alphabets by himself in 1443. He also improved science technology as Koreans invent Sun Clocks, Water Clocks, Rain-Measuring system, Star Map, Korean map, and detail records of Korean small villages. He even widened the territory to the north. So nowadays' Korean territory formed at that age. He even attacked Japanese pirates in Tsushima Island, who had been attacking Korea a lot. So he is considered the best king ever in history of Korea. The ninth king, [[Seongjong of Joseon|Seongjong]] accomplished the first complete Korean [[Gyeongguk daejeon|law code]] in 1485. So the culture and people's lives were improved again. \n\nIn 1592, Japan under [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]] invaded Korea. That war is [[Imjin war]]. At that war, Joseon was in a long peace like PAX ROMANA. So Joseon was not ready for the war. Joseon lose again and again. Japanese army conquered [[Seoul]]. The whole [[Korean peninsula]] was in danger. But [[Yi Sun-sin]], the most renowned general of Korea defeated Japanese fleet in southern Korea coast even 13 ships VS 133 ships. This is the legendary battle called \"[[Battle of Myeongnyang]]\". After then, [[Ming dynasty]] helped Joseon and Japan lose the battle. So Japan under Toyotomi Hideyoshi fell, the [[Edo period]] begins. Korea hurt a lot at [[Imjin war]]. Not long after, Manchurian people invaded Joseon again. It is called [[Qing invasion of Joseon]]. First invasion was for sake. Because Qing was at war between Ming, so Ming's alliance Joseon was threatening. And the second invasion was for Joseon to obey Qing. After then, Qing defeated Ming and took the whole Chinese territories. Joseon also had to obey Qing because Joseon lose the second war against Qing.\n\nAfter Qing invasion, the princes of Joseon dynasty lived their childhood in China. The son of king Injo met [[Adam Schall]] in Beijing. So he wanted to introduce western technologies to Korean people when he becomes a king. Unfortunately, he died before he takes the thrown. After then, the alternative prince became the 17th king of Joseon dynasty, Hyojong, trying to revenge for his kingdom and fallen Ming dynasty to Qing. Later kings such as Yeongjo and Jeongjo tried to improve their people's lives and stop the governors' unreasonable competition. From 17th century to 18th century, Joseon sent diplomats and artists to Japan more than 10 times. This group was called 'Tongshinsa'. They were sent to Japan to teach Japan about advanced Korean cultures. Japanese people liked to receive poems from Korean nobles. At that time, Korea was more powerful than Japan. But that relationship between Joseon and Japan was reversed after 19th century. Because Japan became more powerful than Korea and China, either. So Joseon sent diplomats called 'Sooshinsa' to learn Japanese advanced technologies. After king Jeongjo's death, some noble families controlled the whole kingdom in early 19th century. At the end of that period, Western people invaded Joseon. In 1876, Joseon was set free from Qing so they did not have to obey Qing. But Japanese Empire was happy because Joseon became a perfect independent kingdom. So Japan could intervene the kingdom more. After this, Joseon traded with the US and sent 'Sooshinsa' to Japan, 'Youngshinsa' to Qing, and 'Bobingsa' to the US and Europe. These groups took many modern things to Korean peninsula.\n===Japan: Tokugawa or Edo period (1603\u20131867)===\n{{Main|Edo period}}\n[[File:Great Wave off Kanagawa2.jpg|left|thumb|''[[The Great Wave off Kanagawa]]'', c. 1830 by [[Hokusai]], an example of art flourishing in the Edo Period]]\nIn early-modern  Japan following the [[Sengoku period]] of \"warring states\", central government had been largely reestablished by [[Oda Nobunaga]] and [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]] during the [[Azuchi\u2013Momoyama period]]. After the [[Battle of Sekigahara]] in 1600, central authority fell to [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]] who completed this process and received the title of ''[[sh\u014dgun]]'' in 1603.\n\nSociety in the Japanese \"[[Tokugawa shogunate|Tokugawa period]]\" (see [[Edo society]]), unlike the shogunates before it, was based on the strict class [[hierarchy]] originally established by [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]]. The ''[[daimy\u014d]]s'' (feudal lords) were at the top, followed by the warrior-caste of [[samurai]], with the farmers, artisans, and merchants ranking below. The country was strictly closed to foreigners with few exceptions with the ''[[Sakoku]]'' policy. Literacy rose in the two centuries of isolation.<ref>Geoffrey Barraclough and Norman Stone, ''Harper Collins Atlas of World History'' (2003) p 175.</ref>\n\nIn some parts of the country, particularly smaller regions, ''daimy\u014ds'' and samurai were more or less identical, since ''daimy\u014ds'' might be trained as samurai, and samurai might act as local lords. Otherwise, the largely inflexible nature of this [[social stratification]] system unleashed disruptive forces over time. Taxes on the [[peasantry]] were set at fixed amounts which did not account for inflation or other changes in monetary value. As a result, the tax revenues collected by the samurai landowners were worth less and less over time. This often led to numerous confrontations between noble but impoverished samurai and well-to-do peasants. None, however, proved compelling enough to seriously challenge the established order until the arrival of foreign powers.<ref>McClain, ''Japan: A Modern History'' (2002) pp 69-75.</ref>\n\n=== India ===\n{{Main|Mughal Empire|Maratha Empire}}\n[[File:Shah Abbas the Great receiving the Mughal ambassador Khan\u2019Alam in 1618.jpg|thumb|The [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] ambassador Khan\u2019Alam in 1618 negotiating with [[Abbas I of Persia|Shah Abbas the Great]] of [[Safavid dynasty|Iran]]. ]]\nIn the [[Indian subcontinent]], the Mughal Empire ruled most of India in the early 18th century.

During this period, the Empire was marked by a highly centralized administration connecting the different regions. All the significant monuments of the Mughals, their most visible legacy, date to this period which was characterised by the expansion of Persian cultural influence in the Indian subcontinent, with brilliant literary, artistic, and architectural results. The Maratha Empire was located in the south west of present-day India and expanded greatly under the rule of the [[Peshwa]]s, the prime ministers of the Maratha empire. In 1761, the Maratha army lost the [[Third Battle of Panipat]] against [[Shah Ahmad Durrani]] which halted imperial expansion and the empire was then divided into a confederacy of Maratha states.\n\n=== British and Dutch colonization ===\n{{Main|Dutch East India Company|East India Company}}\nThe European economic and naval powers pushed into Asia, first to do trading, and then to take over major colonies. The Dutch led the way followed by the British. Portugal had arrived first, but was too weak to maintain its small holdings and was largely pushed out, retaining only [[Goa]] and [[Macau]]. The British set up a private organization, the [[East India Company]], which handled both trade and Imperial control of much of India.<ref>Holden Furber, ''Rival Empires of Trade in the Orient, 1600\u20131800'' (U of Minnesota Press,  1976). </ref>\n\nThe [[Company rule in India|commercial colonization of India]] commenced in 1757, after the [[Battle of Plassey]], when the [[Nawab of Bengal]] surrendered his dominions to the British East India Company,<ref>{{Harvnb|Bose|Jalal|2003|p=76}}</ref> in 1765, when the Company was granted the ''diwani'', or the right to collect revenue, in [[Bengal]] and [[Bihar]],<ref>{{Harvnb|Brown|1994|p=46}}, {{Harvnb|Peers|2006|p=30}}</ref> or in 1772, when the Company established a capital in [[Calcutta]], appointed its first [[Governor-General of India|Governor-General]], [[Warren Hastings]], and became directly involved in governance.<ref>{{Harvnb|Metcalf|Metcalf|p=56}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Robert Clive and Mir Jafar after the Battle of Plassey, 1757 by Francis Hayman.jpg|left|thumb|[[Robert Clive]] and [[Mir Jafar]] after the [[Battle of Plassey]], 1757 by Francis Hayman]]\n\nThe [[Maratha Empire|Maratha states]], following the [[Anglo-Maratha wars]], eventually lost to the [[British East India Company]] in 1818 with the [[Third Anglo-Maratha War]].

However, their rivalry cooled in 1824 when an [[Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824|Anglo-Dutch treaty]] demarcated their respective interests in Southeast Asia. From the 1850s onwards, the pace of colonization shifted to a significantly higher gear.\n\nThe [[Dutch East India Company]] (1800) and [[British East India Company]] (1858) were dissolved by their respective governments, who took over the direct administration of the colonies. Only [[Thailand]] was spared the experience of foreign rule, although, Thailand itself was also greatly affected by the power politics of the Western powers. Colonial rule had a profound effect on Southeast Asia. While the colonial powers profited much from the region's vast resources and large market, colonial rule did develop the region to a varying extent.<ref>Commercial agriculture, mining and an export based economy developed rapidly during this period.</ref>\n\n\n\n==Late modern==\n{{further|Modern history#Late modern period}}\n===Central Asia: The Great Game, Russia vs Great Britain===\n[[File:Great Game cartoon from 1878.jpg|thumb|250px|Political cartoon depicting the Afghan [[Sher Ali Khan|Emir Sher Ali]] with the rival \"friends\" the [[Russian Bear]] and British Lion (1878)]]\n\n[[The Great Game]] was a political and diplomatic confrontation between Great Britain and Russia over [[History of Afghanistan|Afghanistan]] and neighbouring territories in [[Central Asia|Central]] and [[South Asia]]. It lasted from 1828 to 1907.  There was no war, but there were many threats. Russia was fearful of British commercial and military inroads into [[Central Asia]], and Britain was fearful of Russia  threatening its largest and most important possession, India. This resulted in an atmosphere of distrust and the constant threat of war between the two empires.  Britain made it a high priority to protect all the approaches to India, and the \"great game\" is primarily how the British did this in terms of a possible Russian threat.  Historians with access  to the archives have concluded that Russia had no plans involving India, as the Russians repeatedly stated.<ref>Barbara Jelavich, ''St. Petersburg and Moscow: Tsarist and Soviet Foreign Policy, 1814\u20131974'' (1974) p 200</ref>\n\nThe Great Game began in 1838 when Britain decided to gain control over the [[Emirate of Afghanistan]] and make it a protectorate, and to use the [[Ottoman Empire]], the [[Qajar dynasty|Persian Empire]], the [[Khanate of Khiva]], and the Emirate of Bukhara as buffer states between both empires. This would protect India and also key British sea trade routes by stopping Russia from gaining a port on the Persian Gulf or the Indian Ocean.  Russia proposed Afghanistan as the neutral zone, and the final result was diving up Afghanistan with a neutral zone in the middle between Russian areas in the north and British in the South. Important episodes included the failed [[First Anglo-Afghan War]] of 1838, the [[First Anglo-Sikh War]] of 1845, the [[Second Anglo-Sikh War]] of 1848, the [[Second Anglo-Afghan War]] of 1878, and the annexation of [[Khanate of Kokand|Kokand]] by Russia.<ref>* {{cite journal |jstor = 40105749|title = Great Britain's Great Game: An Introduction|journal = The International History Review|volume = 2|issue = 2|pages = 160\u2013171|last1 = Ingram|first1 = Edward|year = 1980|doi = 10.1080/07075332.1980.9640210}}\n</ref> The 1901 novel [[Kim (novel)|''Kim'']] by [[Rudyard Kipling]] made the term popular and introduced the new implication of great power rivalry.

The Manchu Qing emperors, especially Confucian scholar [[Kangxi Emperor|Kangxi]], remained largely conservative\u2014retaining the bureaucracy and the scholars within it, as well as the Confucian ideals present in Chinese society. However, changes in the economy and new attempts at resolving certain issues occurred too. These included increased trade with Western countries that brought large amounts of silver into the Chinese economy in exchange for tea, [[porcelain]], and silk textiles. This allowed for a new merchant-class, the [[comprador]]s, to develop. In addition, repairs were done on existing [[Levee|dikes]], canals, roadways, and [[irrigation]] works. This, combined with the lowering of taxes and government-assigned labor, was supposed to calm peasant unrest. However, the Qing failed to control the growing landlord class which had begun to exploit the peasantry and abuse their position.\n\nBy the late 18th century, both internal and external issues began to arise in Qing China's politics, society, and economy. The exam system with which scholars were assigned into the bureaucracy became increasingly corrupt; bribes and other forms of cheating allowed for inexperienced and inept scholars to enter the bureaucracy and this eventually caused rampant neglect of the peasantry, military, and the previously mentioned infrastructure projects. Poverty and banditry steadily rose, especially in rural areas, and mass migrations looking for work throughout China occurred. The perpetually conservative government refused to make reforms that could resolve these issues.\n\n====Opium War====\n{{Main|First Opium War}}\n\nChina saw its status reduced by what it perceived as parasitic trade with Westerners. Originally, European traders were at a disadvantage because the Chinese cared little for their goods, while European demand for Chinese commodities such as tea and porcelain only grew. In order to tip the trade imbalance in their favor, British merchants began to sell Indian [[opium]] to the Chinese. Not only did this sap Chinese bullion reserves, it also led to widespread drug addiction amongst the [[scholar official|bureaucracy]] and society in general. A ban was placed on opium as early as 1729 by the [[Yongzheng Emperor]], but little was done to enforce it. By the early 19th century, under the new [[Daoguang Emperor]], the government began serious efforts to eradicate opium from Chinese society. Leading this endeavour were respected scholar-officials including [[Imperial Commissioner (China)|Imperial Commissioner]] [[Lin Zexu]].\n\nAfter Lin [[Destruction of opium at Humen|destroyed more than 20,000 chests of opium]] in the summer of 1839, Europeans demanded compensation for what they saw as unwarranted Chinese interference in their affairs. When it was not paid, the British declared war later the same year, starting what became known as the [[First Opium War]]. The outdated Chinese [[Junk (ship)|junks]] were no match for the advanced British gunboats, and soon the [[Yangzi River]] region came under threat of British bombardment and invasion. The emperor had no choice but to sue for peace, resulting in the exile of Lin and the making of the [[Treaty of Nanking]], which ceded the British control of [[Hong Kong]] and opened up trade and diplomacy with other European countries, including Germany, France, and the USA.\n====Inner Manchuria====\n{{Further|Northeast China|{{History of Manchuria}}}}\nNortheast China came under influence of Russia with the building of the [[Chinese Eastern Railway]] through [[Harbin, China|Harbin]] to [[Vladivostok]].<ref>Henry B.

During the [[Warlord Era]] in China, [[Zhang Zuolin]] established himself in Northeast China, but was murdered by the Japanese for being too independent.  The former Chinese  emperor, [[Puyi]], was then placed on the throne to lead a Japanese puppet state of [[Manchukuo]].<ref>Louise Young, ''Japan's Total Empire: Manchuria and the Culture of Wartime Imperialism'' (1999) [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=lang_en&id=YjW41KFGw04C&oi=fnd&pg=PP1&dq=manchuria++japan&ots=ukkqHB3sQy&sig=s5VbuYRGeCmqdOk0grwc3JpxSzo#v=onepage&q=manchuria%20%20japan&f=false excerpt] </ref>  In August 1945, the Soviet Union invaded the region.  From 1945 to 1948, Northeast China was a base area for Mao Zedong's  [[People's Liberation Army]] in the [[Chinese Civil War]].  With the encouragement of the Kremlin, the area was used as a staging ground during the Civil War for the [[Communist Party of China|Chinese Communists]], who were victorious in 1949 and have controlled ever since.<ref>Steven I.

Because the noble family of the king's wife got the power and ruled the country by their way. The 26th king of Joseon dynasty, [[Gojong of Korea|Gojong]]'s father, [[Heungseon Daewongun]] wanted the king be powerful again. Even he wasn't the king, as the father of young king, He destroyed noble families and corrupt organizations. So the royal family got the power again. But he wanted to rebuild [[Gyeongbokgung]] palace in order to show the royal power. So he was criticized by people because he spent enormous money. So his son, the real king [[Gojong of Korea|Gojong]] got power. \n\nThe 26th king of Joseon, Gojong changed the nation's name to ''Daehan Jeguk''. It means the [[Korean Empire]]. And he also promoted himself as an emperor. The new empire accepted more western technology and strengthened military power. Unfortunately, in the [[Russo-Japanese war]], Japan won and started to invade Korea. Japan first stole the right to diplomacy from Korean Empire illegally. But every western country ignored this invasion because they knew Japan became a strong country as they defeated Russian Empire. So emperor Gojong sent diplomats to the Netherlands to let everyone know that Japan stole the Empire's right illegally. But it failed. Japan kicked Gojong off. 3 years after, In 1910, Korean Empire became a part of Empire of Japan. It was the first time ever after invasion of Han dynasty in 108 BC.\n\n\n==Contemporary==\n{{further|Contemporary history}}\n[[File:Asia (late 19th century- early 20th century).jpg|thumb|380px|left|Map of Asia for early 20th century]]\n\nThe European powers had control of other parts of Asia by the early 20th century, such as [[British Raj|British India]], [[French Indochina]], [[Spanish East Indies]], and Portuguese [[Macau]] and [[Goa]]. The [[Great Game]] between Russia and Britain was the struggle for power in the Central Asian region in the nineteenth century. The [[Trans-Siberian Railway]], crossing Asia by train, was complete by 1916. Parts of Asia remained free from European control, although not influence, such as [[Persia]], [[Thailand]] and most of China. In the twentieth century, [[Imperial Japan]] expanded into China and Southeast Asia during the [[World War II]]. After the war, many Asian countries became independent from European powers. During the [[Cold War]], the northern parts of Asia were communist controlled with the [[Soviet Union]] and People's Republic of China, while western allies formed pacts such as [[CENTO]] and [[SEATO]]. Conflicts such as the [[Korean War]], [[Vietnam War]] and [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War|Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]] were fought between communists and anti-communists. In the decades after the Second World War, a massive restructuring plan drove Japan to become the world's second-largest economy, a phenomenon known as the [[Japanese post-war economic miracle]]. The [[Arab\u2013Israeli conflict]] has dominated much of the recent history of the Middle East. After the [[Soviet Union]]'s collapse in 1991, there were many new independent nations in Central Asia.\n\n===China===\n{{main|History of the Republic of China|History of the People's Republic of China}}\nPrior to [[World War II]], China faced a civil war between [[Mao Zedong]]'s Communist party and [[Chiang Kai-shek]]'s nationalist party; the nationalists appeared to be in the lead. However, once the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Japanese invaded]] in 1937, the two parties were forced to form a temporary cease-fire in order to defend China. The nationalists faced many military failures that caused them to lose territory and subsequently, respect from the Chinese masses. In contrast, the communists' use of guerilla warfare (led by [[Lin Biao]]) proved effective against the Japanese's conventional methods and put the Communist Party on top by 1945. They also gained popularity for the reforms they were already applying in controlled areas, including land redistribution, education reforms, and widespread health care. For the next four years, the nationalists would be forced to retreat to the small island east of China, known as [[Taiwan]] (formerly known as Formosa), where they remain today. In mainland China, [[China|People's Republic of China]] was established by the Communist Party, with [[Mao Zedong]] as its [[President of the People's Republic of China|state chairman]].\n\nThe communist government in China was defined by the party [[Professional revolutionaries|cadres]]. These hard-line officers controlled the [[People's Liberation Army]], which itself controlled large amounts of the bureaucracy. This system was further controlled by the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of China|Central Committee]], which additionally supported the state chairman who was considered the head of the government. The People's Republic's foreign policies included the repressing of [[secession]] attempts in Mongolia and Tibet and supporting of [[North Korea]] and [[North Vietnam]] in the [[Korean War]] and [[Vietnam War]], respectively. Additionally, by 1960 China began to cut off its connections with the Soviet Union due to border disputes and an increasing Chinese sense of superiority, especially the personal feeling of Mao over the Russian premier, [[Nikita Khrushchev]].\n\nToday China plays important roles in world economics and politics. China today is the world's second largest economy and the second fastest growing economy.\n==Korea==\n[[File:2018 inter-Korean summit 01.jpg|thumb|right|The third Inter-Korean Summit between South Korean president [[Moon Jae-in]] and North Korean supreme leader [[Kim Jong-un]]. It was a historical event that symbolized the peace of Asia.]]\nAfter [[Korean War]], Korea divided into North and South. In 1960, [[North Korea]] was far more wealthier than [[South Korea]]. But in 1970, South Korea begins to outrun the North Korean economy. In 2018, South Korea is ranked #10 in world [[GDP]] ranking.\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Ancient Asian history]]\n* [[History of Southeast Asia]]\n* {{slink|List of history journals|Asia}}\n* [[Prehistoric Asia]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n{{Refbegin}}\n* Best, Antony.

The characteristic trade of silk through the [[Silk Road]] connected various regions from China, India, Central Asia, and the Middle East to Europe and Africa.]]\n\nThe '''history of Asia''' can be seen as the collective history of several distinct peripheral coastal regions such as [[East Asia]], [[South Asia]], [[History of Southeast Asia|Southeast Asia]] and the [[Middle East]] linked by the interior mass of the Eurasian [[steppe]].\n\nThe coastal periphery was the home to some of the world's earliest known civilizations and religions, with each of the three regions developing early civilizations around fertile river valleys. These valleys were fertile because the soil there was rich and could bear many root crops. The civilizations in [[Mesopotamia]], [[India]], and [[China]] shared many similarities and likely exchanged technologies and ideas such as mathematics and the wheel. Other notions such as that of writing likely developed individually in each area. Cities, states and then empires developed in these lowlands.\n\nThe steppe region had long been inhabited by mounted nomads, and from the central steppes they could reach all areas of the Asian continent. The northern part of the continent, covering much of [[Siberia]] was also inaccessible to the steppe nomads due to the dense forests and the [[tundra]]. These areas in Siberia were very sparsely populated.\n\nThe centre and periphery were kept separate by mountains and deserts. The [[Caucasus Mountains|Caucasus]], [[Himalayas|Himalaya]], [[Karakum Desert]], and [[Gobi Desert]] formed barriers that the steppe horsemen could only cross with difficulty.  While technologically and culturally the city dwellers were more advanced, they could do little militarily to defend against the mounted hordes of the steppe.  However, the lowlands did not have enough open grasslands to support a large horsebound force.  Thus the nomads who conquered states in the Middle East were soon forced to adapt to the local societies.\n\nThe [[spread of Islam]] waved the [[Islamic Golden Age]] and the [[Timurid Renaissance]], which later influenced the [[Islamic Gunpowders]].\n\nAsia's history features major developments seen in other parts of the world, as well as events that have affected those other regions. These include the trade of the [[Silk Road]], which spread cultures, languages, religions, and diseases throughout Afro-Eurasian trade. Another major advancement was the innovation of [[gunpowder]] in medieval China, later developed by the Gunpowder empires, mainly by the [[Mughal tribe|Mughal]]s and [[Safavid]]s, which led to advanced warfare through the use of guns.\n\n{{TOC limit|limit=3}}\n\n==Prehistory==\n{{main|Prehistory of Asia}}\nA report by archaeologist Rakesh Tewari on Lahuradewa, [[India]] shows new C14 datings that range between 9000 and 8000 BCE associated with rice, making Lahuradewa the earliest Neolithic site in entire South Asia.<ref name=\"archae\">{{cite web\n|url=http://www.uparchaeology.org/archae.pdf\n|title=Second preliminary report of the excavations at Lahuradewa district\n|publisher=Directorate of Archaeology (U.P, India)\n|url-status=dead\n|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613040512/http://www.uparchaeology.org/archae.pdf\n|archivedate=2011-06-13\n|df=\n}}\n</ref>\n\nThe [[prehistoric Beifudi site]] near Yixian in [[Hebei]] Province, China,  contains relics of a culture contemporaneous with the [[Cishan culture|Cishan]] and [[Xinglongwa culture|Xinglongwa]] cultures of about 8000\u20137000 BCE, neolithic cultures east of the [[Taihang Mountains]],  filling in an archaeological gap between the two Northern Chinese cultures.

Since there was little rainfall, [[irrigation]] systems were necessary.

Some of the great cities of this civilization include [[Harappa]] and [[Mohenjo-daro]], which had a high level of town planning and arts. The cause of the destruction of these regions around 1700 BCE is debatable, although evidence suggests it was caused by natural disasters (especially flooding).<ref>{{cite web|title=The Indus Valley Civilisation|url=http://library.thinkquest.org/11372/data/history.htm|work=ThinkQuest|accessdate=9 February 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130509014129/http://library.thinkquest.org/11372/data/history.htm|archivedate=9 May 2013|df=}}</ref> This era marks [[Vedic period]] in India, which lasted from roughly 1500 to 500 BCE.

Persian politics included a tolerance for other cultures, a highly [[centralized government]], and significant infrastructure developments. Later, in [[Darius I|Darius the Great]]'s rule, the territories were integrated, a bureaucracy was developed, nobility were assigned military positions, tax collection was carefully organized, and spies were used to ensure the loyalty of regional officials. The primary religion of Persia at this time was [[Zoroastrianism]], developed by the philosopher [[Zoroaster]]. It introduced an early form of [[monotheism]] to the area. The religion banned animal sacrifice and the use of intoxicants in rituals; and introduced the concept of spiritual salvation through personal moral action, an [[end time]], and both [[General judgment|general]] and [[Particular judgment]] with a [[heaven]] or [[hell]]. These concepts would heavily influence later emperors and the masses. More importantly, Zoroastrianism would be an important precursor for the [[Abrahamic religions]] such as Christianity, Islam, or Judaism. The Persian Empire was successful in establishing peace and stability throughout the Middle East and were a major influence in art, politics (affecting Hellenistic leaders), and religion.\n\n[[Alexander the Great]] conquered this dynasty in the 4th century BCE, creating the brief [[Hellenistic period]]. He was unable to establish stability and after his death, Persia broke into small, weak dynasties including the [[Seleucid Empire]], followed by the [[Parthian Empire]]. By the end of the Classical age, Persia had been reconsolidated into the [[Sassanid Empire]], also known as the second Persian Empire.\n\nThe [[Roman Empire]] would later control parts of Western Asia. The [[Seleucid]], [[Parthian Empire|Parthian]] and [[Sassanid]] dynasties of Persia dominated Western Asia for centuries.\n\n====India====\n{{See also|Greater India}}\n\nThe Maurya and Gupta empires are called the Golden Age of India and were marked by extensive inventions and discoveries in science, technology, art, religion, and philosophy that crystallized the elements of what is generally known as Indian culture. The religions of [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]], which began in Indian sub-continent, were an important influence on South, East and Southeast Asia.\n\n[[File:Hinduism Expansion in Asia.svg|thumb|270px|Expansion of [[History of Indian influence on Southeast Asia|Hinduism in Southeast Asia]]]]\nBy 600 BCE, India had been divided into 17 regional states that would occasionally feud amongst themselves. In 327 BCE, [[Alexander the Great]] came to India with a vision of conquering the whole world. He crossed northwestern India and created the province [[Bactria]] but could not move further because his army wanted to go back to their family. Shortly prior, the soldier [[Chandragupta Maurya]] began to take control of the Ganges river and soon established the [[Maurya Empire]]. The Maurya Empire (Sanskrit: \u092e\u094c\u0930\u094d\u092f \u0930\u093e\u091c\u0935\u0902\u0936, Maurya R\u0101javan\u015bha) was the geographically extensive and powerful empire in ancient India, ruled by the Mauryan dynasty from 321 to 185 BCE. It was one of the world's largest empires in its time, stretching to the [[Himalayas]] in the north, what is now [[Assam]] in the east, probably beyond modern [[Pakistan]] in the west, and annexing [[Balochistan]] and much of what is now [[Afghanistan]], at its greatest extent. South of Mauryan empire was the [[Tamilakam]] an independent country dominated by three dynasties, the [[Pandya dynasty|Pandyans]], [[Cholas]] and [[Cheras]]. The government established by Chandragupta was led by an autocratic king, who primarily relied on the military to assert his power.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=65}} It also applied the use of a bureaucracy and even sponsored a postal service.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=65}} Chandragupta's grandson, [[Ashoka]], greatly extended the empire by conquering most of modern-day India (save for the southern tip). He eventually converted to Buddhism, though, and began a peaceful life where he promoted the religion as well as humane methods throughout India. The Maurya Empire would disintegrate soon after Ashoka's death and was conquered by the Kushan invaders from the northwest, establishing the [[Kushan Empire]]. Their conversion to Buddhism caused the religion to be associated with foreigners and therefore a decline in its popularity occurred.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=65}}\n\nThe Kushan Empire would fall apart by 220 CE, creating more political turmoil in India. Then in 320, the [[Gupta Empire]] (Sanskrit: \u0917\u0941\u092a\u094d\u0924 \u0930\u093e\u091c\u0935\u0902\u0936, Gupta R\u0101javan\u015bha) was established and covered much of the Indian Subcontinent. Founded by [[Maharaja Sri-Gupta]], the dynasty was the model of a classical civilization. Gupta kings united the area primarily through negotiation of local leaders and families as well as strategical intermarriage.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=66}} Their rule covered less land than the Maurya Empire, but established the greatest stability.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=66}} In 535, the empire ended when India was overrun by the [[Hunas]].\n\n====Classical China====\n\n=====Zhou Dynasty=====\n{{main|Zhou dynasty}}\n[[File:Zhou dynasty 1000 BC.png|thumb|Population concentration and boundaries of the [[Western Zhou]] dynasty in China]]\nSince 1029 BCE, the [[Zhou dynasty]] ({{zh|c=\u5468\u671d|p=Zh\u014du Ch\u00e1o|w=Chou Ch'ao}} {{IPA-cmn|t\u0282\u00f3\u028a t\u0282\u02b0\u0251\u030c\u028a|}}), had existed in China and it would continue to until 258 BCE.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=43}} The Zhou dynasty had been using a [[Feudalism|feudal system]] by giving power to local nobility and relying on their loyalty in order to control its large territory.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=43}} As a result, the Chinese government at this time tended to be very decentralized and weak, and there was often little the emperor could do to resolve national issues. Nonetheless, the government was able to retain its position with the creation of the [[Mandate of Heaven]], which could establish an emperor as divinely chosen to rule. The Zhou additionally discouraged the [[human sacrifice]] of the preceding eras and unified the [[Chinese language]]. Finally, the Zhou government encouraged settlers to move into the [[Yangtze|Yangtze River]] valley, thus creating the Chinese Middle Kingdom.\n\nBut by 500 BCE, its political stability began to decline due to repeated nomadic incursions{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=43}} and internal conflict derived from the fighting princes and families. This was lessened by the many philosophical movements, starting with the life of [[Confucius]]. His philosophical writings (called [[Confucianism]]) concerning the respect of elders and of the state would later be popularly used in the Han dynasty. Additionally, [[Laozi]]'s concepts of [[Taoism]], including [[yin and yang]] and the innate duality and balance of nature and the universe, became popular throughout this period. Nevertheless, the Zhou Dynasty eventually disintegrated as the local nobles began to gain more power and their conflict devolved into the [[Warring States period]], from 402 to 201 BCE.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=44}}\n\n=====Qin Dynasty=====\n{{main|Qin Dynasty}}\nOne leader eventually came on top, [[Qin Shi Huang]] ({{zh|c=\u59cb\u7687\u5e1d}}, ''Sh\u01d0 Hu\u00e1ngd\u00ec''), who overthrew the last Zhou emperor and established the Qin dynasty.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=43}} The [[Qin dynasty]] (Chinese: \u79e6\u671d; pinyin: Q\u00edn Ch\u00e1o) was the first ruling dynasty of Imperial China, lasting from 221 to 207 BCE.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=42}} The new Emperor abolished the feudal system and directly appointed a bureaucracy that would rely on him for power. Huang's imperial forces crushed any regional resistance, and they furthered the Chinese empire by expanding down to the [[South China Sea]] and northern [[Vietnam]]. Greater organization brought a uniform tax system, a national census, regulated road building (and cart width), standard measurements, standard coinage, and an official written and spoken language.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=45}} Further reforms included new irrigation projects, the encouragement of [[silk]] manufacturing,{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=45}} and (most famously) the beginning of the construction of the Great Wall of China\u2014designed to keep out the nomadic raiders who'd constantly badger the Chinese people. However, Shi Huang was infamous for his tyranny, forcing laborers to build the Wall, ordering heavy taxes, and severely punishing all who opposed him. He oppressed Confucians and promoted [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalism]], the idea that people were inherently evil, and that a strong, forceful government was needed to control them. Legalism was infused with realistic, logical views and rejected the pleasures of educated conversation as frivolous. All of this made Shi Huang extremely unpopular with the people. As the Qin began to weaken, various factions began to fight for control of China.\n\n=====Han Dynasty=====\n{{main|Han dynasty}}\n[[File:SeidenstrasseGMT.JPG|300px|thumb|The [[Silk Road]] in Asia]]\nThe [[Han dynasty]] (simplified Chinese: \u6c49\u671d; traditional Chinese: \u6f22\u671d; pinyin: H\u00e0n Ch\u00e1o; 206 BCE \u2013 220 CE) was the second imperial dynasty of China, preceded by the Qin Dynasty and succeeded by the Three Kingdoms (220\u2013265 CE). Spanning over four centuries, the period of the Han Dynasty is considered a golden age in Chinese history. One of the Han dynasty's greatest emperors, [[Emperor Wu of Han]], established a peace throughout China comparable to the [[Pax Romana]] seen in the Mediterranean a hundred years later.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=45}} To this day, China's majority ethnic group refers to itself as the \"Han people\". The Han Dynasty was established when two peasants succeeded in rising up against Shi Huang's significantly weaker successor-son. The new Han government retained the centralization and bureaucracy of the Qin, but greatly reduced the repression seen before. They expanded their territory into [[Korea]], [[Vietnam]], and [[Central Asia]], creating an even larger empire than the Qin.\n\nThe Han developed contacts with the Persian Empire in the Middle East and the Romans, through the [[Silk Road]], with which they were able to trade many commodities\u2014primarily silk. Many ancient civilizations were influenced by the [[Silk Road]], which connected China, [[India]], the Middle East and Europe. Han emperors like Wu also promoted Confucianism as the national \"religion\" (although it is debated by theologians as to whether it is defined as such or as a philosophy). Shrines devoted to Confucius were built and Confucian philosophy was taught to all scholars who entered the Chinese bureaucracy. The bureaucracy was further improved with the introduction of an examination system that selected scholars of high merit. These bureaucrats were often upper-class people educated in special schools, but whose power was often checked by the lower-class brought into the bureaucracy through their skill. The Chinese imperial bureaucracy was very effective and highly respected by all in the realm and would last over 2,000 years. The Han government was highly organized and it commanded the military, judicial law (which used a system of courts and strict laws), agricultural production, the economy, and the general lives of its people. The government also promoted intellectual philosophy, scientific research, and detailed historical records.\n\nHowever, despite all of this impressive stability, central power began to lose control by the turn of the [[Common Era]]. As the Han Dynasty declined, many factors continued to pummel it into submission until China was left in a state of chaos. By 100 CE, philosophical activity slowed, and corruption ran rampant in the bureaucracy. Local landlords began to take control as the scholars neglected their duties, and this resulted in heavy taxation of the peasantry. Taoists began to gain significant ground and protested the decline. They started to proclaim magical powers and promised to save China with them; the Taoist [[Yellow Turban Rebellion]] in 184 (led by rebels in yellow scarves) failed but was able to weaken the government. The aforementioned Huns combined with diseases killed up to half of the population and officially ended the Han dynasty by 220. The ensuing period of chaos was so terrible it lasted for three centuries, where many weak regional rulers and dynasties failed to establish order in China. This period of chaos and attempts at order is commonly known as that of the [[Six Dynasties]]. The first part of this included the [[Three Kingdoms]] which started in 220 and describes the brief and weak successor \"dynasties\" that followed the Han. In 265, the [[Jin dynasty (265\u2013420)|Jin dynasty]] of China was started and this soon split into two different empires in control of northwestern and southeastern China. In 420, the conquest and abdication of those two dynasties resulted in the first of the [[Southern and Northern Dynasties]]. The Northern and Southern Dynasties passed through until finally, by 557, the [[Northern Zhou|Northern Zhou dynasty]] ruled the north and the [[Chen dynasty]] ruled the south.\n\n==Medieval{{anchor|Medieval}}==\nDuring this period, the [[Eastern world]] empires continued to expand through trade, migration and conquests of neighboring areas. Gunpowder was widely used as early as the 11th century and they were using moveable type printing five hundred years before Gutenberg created his press. Buddhism, Taoism, Confucianism were the dominant philosophies of the Far East during the Middle Ages. Marco Polo was not the first Westerner to travel to the Orient and return with amazing stories of this different culture, but his accounts published in the late 13th and early 14th centuries were the first to be widely read throughout Europe.\n\n===Western Asia (Middle East)===\n{{main|Medieval Middle East}}\n[[File:Byzantine and Sassanid Empires in 600 CE.png|thumb|right|310px|Byzantine and Sassanian Empires in 600 AD]]\nThe Arabian peninsula and the surrounding [[Middle East]] and [[Near East]] regions saw dramatic change during the Medieval era caused primarily by the spread of [[Islam]] and the establishment of the Arabian Empires.\n\nIn the 5th century, the Middle East was separated into small, weak states; the two most prominent were the [[Sassanian Empire]] of the [[History of Iran|Persians]] in what is now [[Iran]] and [[Iraq]], and the Byzantine Empire in [[Anatolia]] (modern-day [[Turkey]]). The Byzantines and Sassanians fought with each other continually, a reflection of the rivalry between the Roman Empire and the Persian Empire seen during the previous five hundred years. The fighting weakened both states, leaving the stage open to a new power. Meanwhile, the nomadic [[Bedouin]] tribes who dominated the Arabian desert saw a period of tribal stability, greater trade networking and a familiarity with Abrahamic religions or monotheism.\n\nWhile the [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] Roman and [[Sassanian Empire|Sassanid]] Persian empires were both weakened by the [[Byzantine\u2013Sasanian War of 602\u2013628]], a new power in the form of [[Islam]] grew in the Middle East under [[Muhammad in Medina]]. In a series of rapid [[Muslim conquests]], the [[Rashidun army]], led by the [[Caliph]]s and skilled military commanders such as [[Khalid ibn al-Walid]], swept through most of the Middle East, taking more than half of Byzantine territory in the [[Arab\u2013Byzantine wars]] and completely engulfing Persia in the [[Muslim conquest of Persia]]. It would be the Arab [[Caliphate]]s of the [[Middle Ages]] that would first unify the entire Middle East as a distinct region and create the dominant [[Arab|ethnic identity]] that persists today. These Caliphates included the [[Rashidun Caliphate]], [[Umayyad Caliphate]], [[Abbasid Caliphate]], and later the [[Seljuq Empire]].\n\n[[File:Caliphate 750.jpg|thumb|270px|The [[early Muslim conquests]], 622\u2013750]]\nAfter Muhammad introduced Islam, it jump-started Middle Eastern culture into an [[Islamic Golden Age]], inspiring achievements in [[architecture]], the revival of old advances in science and technology, and the formation of a distinct way of life. Muslims saved and spread Greek advances in [[History of medicine|medicine]], [[History of elementary algebra|algebra]], [[History of geometry|geometry]], [[History of astronomy|astronomy]], [[History of anatomy|anatomy]], and [[History of ethics|ethics]] that would later finds it way back to Western Europe.\n\nThe dominance of the Arabs came to a sudden end in the mid-11th century with the arrival of the [[Seljuq Turks]], migrating south from the Turkic homelands in Central Asia. They conquered Persia, Iraq (capturing Baghdad in 1055), Syria, Palestine, and the [[Hejaz]]. This was followed by a series of Christian Western Europe invasions. The fragmentation of the Middle East allowed joined forces, mainly from England, France, and the emerging [[Holy Roman Empire]], to enter the region. In 1099 the knights of the [[First Crusade]] captured [[Jerusalem]] and founded the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]], which survived until 1187, when [[Saladin]] retook the city. Smaller crusader fiefdoms survived until 1291. In the early 13th century, a new wave of invaders, the armies of the [[Mongol Empire]], swept through the region, sacking Baghdad in the [[Siege of Baghdad (1258)]] and advancing as far south as the border of [[Egypt]] in what became known as the [[Mongol conquests]]. The Mongols eventually retreated in 1335, but the chaos that ensued throughout the empire deposed the Seljuq Turks. In 1401, the region was further plagued by the Turko-Mongol, [[Timur]], and his ferocious raids. By then, another group of Turks had arisen as well, the [[Ottoman Turks|Ottomans]].\n\n===Central Asia===\n{{main|Medieval Central Asia}}\n\n====Mongol Empire====\n[[Image:Mongolia 1500 AD.jpg|thumb|300px|The [[Turco-Mongol tradition|Turco-Mongol]] residual states and domains by the 15th century]]\nThe [[Mongol Empire]] conquered a large part of Asia in the 13th century, an area extending from China to Europe. Medieval Asia was the kingdom of the Khans. Never before had any person controlled as much land as [[Genghis Khan]]. He built his power unifying separate Mongol tribes before expanding his kingdom south and west. He and his grandson, Kublai Khan, controlled lands in China, Burma, Central Asia, Russia, Iran, the Middle East, and Eastern Europe. Estimates are that the Mongol armies reduced the population of China by nearly a third. Genghis Khan was a pagan who tolerated nearly every religion, and their culture often suffered the harshest treatment from Mongol armies. The Khan armies pushed as far west as Jerusalem before being defeated in 1260.\n\n===South Asia/Indian Subcontinent===\n====India====\n{{main|Medieval India}}\n[[File:Delhi Sultanate map.png|thumb|right|320px|The [[Delhi Sultanate]].]]\n\nThe Indian early medieval age, 600 to 1200, is defined by regional kingdoms and cultural diversity. When [[Harsha]] of [[Kannauj]], who ruled much of the Indo-Gangetic Plain from 606 to 647, attempted to expand southwards, he was defeated by the [[Chalukya dynasty|Chalukya]] ruler of the Deccan. When his successor attempted to expand eastwards, he was defeated by the [[Pala Empire|Pala]] king of [[Bengal]]. When the Chalukyas attempted to expand southwards, they were defeated by the [[Pallava]]s from farther south, who in turn were opposed by the [[Pandyas]] and the [[Cholas]] from still farther south. The Cholas could under the rule of [[Raja Raja Chola]] defeat their rivals and rise to a regional power. Cholas expanded northward and defeated [[Eastern Chalukya]], [[Eastern Ganga dynasty|Kalinga]] and the [[Pala Empire|Pala]]. Under [[Rajendra Chola]] the Cholas created the first notable navy of Indian subcontinent. The [[Chola navy]] extended the influence of Chola empire to [[southeast asia]]. During this time, pastoral peoples whose land had been cleared to make way for the growing agricultural economy were accommodated within caste society, as were new non-traditional ruling classes.<ref>{{citation|last=Stein|first=B.|author-link=Burton Stein|date=1998|title=A History of India|edition=1st|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|place=Oxford|isbn=978-0-631-20546-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SXdVS0SzQSAC|pages=119\u2013122}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Muslim conquest in the Indian subcontinent]] mainly took place from the 12th century onwards, though earlier Muslim conquests include the limited inroads into modern Afghanistan and Pakistan and the Umayyad campaigns in India, during the time of the Rajput kingdoms in the 8th century.\n\nMajor economic and military powers like the [[Delhi Sultanate]] and [[Bengal Sultanate]], were seen to be established. The search of their wealth led the [[Voyages of Christopher Columbus]].\n\n===East Asia===\n{{main|History of East Asia}}\n\n====China====\n{{main|Medieval China}}\nChina saw the rise and fall of the Sui, Tang, Song, and Yuan dynasties and therefore improvements in its bureaucracy, the spread of [[Buddhism]], and the advent of [[Neo-Confucianism]]. It was an unsurpassed era for Chinese ceramics and painting. Medieval architectural masterpieces the Great South Gate in Todaiji, Japan, and the Tien-ning Temple in Peking, China are some of the surviving constructs from this era.\n\n=====Sui Dynasty=====\n{{main|Sui dynasty}}\nA new powerful dynasty began to rise in the 580s, amongst the divided factions of China. This was started when an aristocrat named Yang Jian married his daughter into the Northern Zhou dynasty. He proclaimed himself [[Emperor Wen of Sui]] and appeased the nomadic military by abandoning the Confucian scholar-gentry. Emperor Wen soon led the conquest of the southern Chen Dynasty and united China once more under the [[Sui dynasty]]. The emperor lowered taxes and constructed granaries that he used to prevent famine and control the market. Later Wen's son would murder him for the throne and declare himself [[Emperor Yang of Sui]]. Emperor Yang revived the Confucian scholars and the bureaucracy, much to anger of the aristocrats and nomadic military leaders. Yang became an excessive leader who overused China's resources for personal luxury and perpetuated exhaustive attempts to conquer Goguryeo. His military failures and neglect of the empire forced his own ministers to assassinate him in 618, ending the Sui Dynasty.\n\n=====Tang dynasty=====\n{{main|Tang dynasty}}\n[[File:Battle of Talas.png|thumb|380px|[[Battle of Talas]] between Tang dynasty and [[Abbasid Caliphate]] c. 751]]\n\nFortunately, one of Yang's most respectable advisors, Li Yuan, was able to claim the throne quickly, preventing a chaotic collapse. He proclaimed himself [[Emperor Gaozu of Tang|Emperor Gaozu]], and established the [[Tang dynasty]] in 623. The Tang saw expansion of China through conquest to Tibet in the west, [[Vietnam]] in the south, and Manchuria in the north. Tang emperors also improved the education of scholars in the Chinese bureaucracy. A Ministry of Rites was established and the examination system was improved to better qualify scholars for their jobs.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=270|loc=Chapter 12|quote=In the Tang and Song periods, the examination system was greatly expanded, and the pattern of advancement in the civil service was much more regularized. This meant that in the political realm more than any previous political system (and those yet to come for centuries), the Chinese connected merit as measured by tested skills with authority and status.}} In addition, Buddhism became popular in China with two different strains between the peasantry and the elite, the [[Pure Land Buddhism|Pure Land]] and [[Zen]] strains, respectively.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|pages=271\u2013272|loc=Chapter 12|quote=Among the masses, the salvationist pure land strain of Mahayana Buddhism won widespread conversions because it seemed to provide a refuge from an age of war and turmoil. Members of the elite class, on the other hand, were more attracted to the Chan variant of Buddhism, or Zen as it is known in Japan and the West.}} Greatly supporting the spread of Buddhism was [[Wu Zetian|Empress Wu]], who additionally claimed an unofficial \"Zhou dynasty\" and displayed China's tolerance of a woman ruler, which was rare at the time. However, Buddhism would also experience some backlash, especially from Confucianists and Taoists. This would usually involve criticism about how it was costing the state money, since the government was unable to tax Buddhist monasteries, and additionally sent many grants and gifts to them.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=273|loc=Chapter 12|quote=Because monastic lands and resources were not taxed, the Tang regime lost huge amounts of revenue as a result of imperial grants or the gifts of wealthy families to Buddhist monasteries.}}\n\nThe Tang dynasty began to decline under the rule of [[Emperor Xuanzong of Tang|Emperor Xuanzong]], who began to neglect the economy and military and caused unrest amongst the court officials due to the excessive influence of his concubine, [[Yang Guifei]], and her family.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=274|loc=Chapter 12|quote=The arrogance and excessive ambition of Yang Guifei and her family angered members of the rival cliques at court, who took every opportunity to turn Yang's excesses into a cause for popular unreast.}} This eventually sparked a revolt in 755.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=274|loc=Chapter 12|quote=The deepening crisis came to a head in 755 when one of [Xuanzong]'s main military leaders&nbsp;... led a widely supported revolt with the aim of founding a new dynasty to supplant the Tang.}} Although the revolt failed, subduing it required involvement with the unruly nomadic tribes outside of China and distributing more power to local leaders\u2014leaving the government and economy in a degraded state. The Tang dynasty officially ended in 907 and various factions led by the aforementioned nomadic tribes and local leaders would fight for control of China in the [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period]].\n\n=====Liao, Song and Jin dynasties=====\n{{main|Liao dynasty|Song dynasty|Jin dynasty (1115\u20131234)}}\nBy 960, most of China proper had been reunited under the [[Song dynasty]], although it lost territories in the north and could not defeat one of the nomadic tribes there\u2014the [[Liao dynasty]] of the highly sinicized [[Khitan people]]. From then on, the Song would have to pay tribute to avoid invasion and thus set the precedent for other nomadic kingdoms to oppress them. The Song also saw the revival of Confucianism in the form of [[Neo-Confucianism]]. This had the effect of putting the Confucian scholars at a higher status than aristocrats or Buddhists and also intensified the reduction of power in women. The infamous practice of [[foot binding]] developed in this period as a result. Eventually the Liao dynasty in the north was overthrown by the [[Jin dynasty (1115\u20131234)|Jin dynasty]] of the Manchu-related [[Jurchen people]]. The new Jin kingdom [[Jin\u2013Song Wars|invaded northern China]], leaving the Song to flee farther south and creating the [[Southern Song dynasty]] in 1126. There, cultural life flourished.\n\n=====Yuan Dynasty=====\n{{main|Yuan dynasty}}\n [[File:Route of Marco Polo.png|thumb|380px|Map of Marco Polo's travels]]\nBy 1227, the Mongols had conquered the [[Western Xia]] kingdom northwest of China. Soon the Mongols incurred upon the Jin empire of the Jurchens. Chinese cities were soon besieged by the Mongol hordes that showed little mercy for those who resisted and the Southern Song Chinese were quickly losing territory. In 1271 the current great khan, [[Kublai Khan]], claimed himself Emperor of China and officially established the Yuan Dynasty. By 1290, all of China was under control of the Mongols, marking the first time they were ever completely conquered by a foreign invader; the new capital was established at [[Khanbaliq]] (modern-day [[Beijing]]). Kublai Khan segregated Mongol culture from Chinese culture by discouraging interactions between the two peoples, separating living spaces and places of worship, and reserving top administrative positions to Mongols, thus preventing Confucian scholars to continue the bureaucratic system. Nevertheless, Kublai remained fascinated with Chinese thinking, surrounding himself with Chinese Buddhist, Taoist, or Confucian advisors.\n\nMongol women displayed a contrasting independent nature compared to the Chinese women who continued to be suppressed. Mongol women often rode out on hunts or even to war. Kublai's wife, [[Chabi]], was a perfect example of this; Chabi advised her husband on several political and diplomatic matters; she convinced him that the Chinese were to be respected and well-treated in order to make them easier to rule.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=327|loc=Chapter 14|quote=[Chabi] convinced Kubilai that the harsh treatment of the survivors of the defeated Song imperial family would only anger the peoples of north China and make them more difficult to rule.}} However this was not enough to affect Chinese women's position, and the increasingly Neo-Confucian successors of Kublai further repressed Chinese and even Mongol women.\n\nThe Black Death, which would later ravage Western Europe, had its beginnings in Asia, where it wiped out large populations in China in 1331.\n\n====Korea====\n{{main|Medieval Korea}}\n\n====[[Three Kingdoms of Korea]]====\n[[File:History of Korea-476.PNG|thumb|left|Korean peninsula in 476 AD. There are three kingdoms and Gaya Union in the picture. This picture shows the heyday of [[Goguryeo]]]]\nThe three Kingdoms of Korea involves [[Goguryeo]] in north, [[Baekje]] in southwest, and [[Silla]] in southeast Korean peninsula. These three kingdoms were like a bridge of cultures between China and Japan. Thanks to them, Japan was able to accept Chinese splendid cultures. [[Prince Sh\u014dtoku]] of Japan had been taught by two teachers. One was from [[Baekje]], the other was from [[Goguryeo]]. Once Japan invaded [[Silla]], Goguryeo helped Silla to defeat Japan. [[Baekje]] met the earliest heyday of them. Its heyday was the 5th century AD. Its capital was [[Seoul]]. During its heyday, the kingdom made colonies overseas. Liaodong, China and Kyushu, Japan were the colonies of [[Baekje]] during its short heyday. [[Goguryeo]] was the strongest kingdom of all. They sometimes called themselves  as an Empire. Its heyday was 6th century. King Gwanggaeto widened its territory  to north. So Goguryeo dominated from Korean peninsula to Manchuria. And his son, [[Jangsu of Goguryeo|King Jangsu]] widened its territory to south. He occupied [[Seoul]], and moved its capital to [[Pyeongyang]]. Goguryeo almost occupied three quarters of South Korean peninsula thanks to king Jangsu who widened the kingdom's territory to south. [[Silla]] met the latest heyday. King Jinheung went north and occupied[[Seoul]]. But it was short. [[Baekje]] became stronger and attacked Silla. Baekje occupied more than 40 cities of Silla. So Silla could hardly survive.\nChina's Sui dynasty invaded [[Goguryeo]] and [[Goguryeo\u2013Sui War]] occurs between Korea and China. [[Goguryeo]] won against China and [[Sui dynasty]] fell. After then, [[Tang dynasty]] reinvaded [[Goguryeo]] and helped [[Silla]] to unify the peninsula. Because Silla was the weakest of all, so it asked Tang for help. [[Goguryeo]], [[Baekje]], and Japan helped each other against Tang-Silla alliance, but [[Baekje]] and [[Goguryeo]] fell. Unfortunately, [[Tang dynasty]] betrayed [[Silla]] in order to occupy the whole Korean peninsula. During the [[Silla-Tang war]], people of fallen Baekje and Goguryeo helped Silla against Chinese invasion, so Silla could beat China and unified the peninsula. This war helped Korean people to unite mentally.\n=====North-South States Period=====\n[[File:History of Korea-Inter-country Age-830 CE.gif|thumb|left|[[Balhae]] in the north, [[Later Silla]] in the south]]\n[[File:Korea - Seoul - National Museum - Incense Burner 0252-06a.jpg|thumb|right|the [[Goryeo ware]], which shows splendid culture of [[Goryeo]] in mediaeval Korea.]]\n\nThe rest of [[Goguryeo]] people established [[Balhae]] and won the war against Tang in later 7th century AD. [[Balhae]] is the north state, and [[Later Silla]] was the south state. Balhae was a quite strong kingdom as their ancestor Goguryeo did. Finally, the Emperor of Tang dynasty admits Balhae as 'A strong country in the East'. They liked to trade with Japan, China, and Silla. Balhae and Later Silla sent a lot of international students to China. And Arabian merchants came into Korean peninsula, so Korea became known as 'Silla' in the western countries. Silla improved Korean writing system called Idu letters. Idu affected [[Katakana]] of Japan. [[Liao dynasty]] invaded [[Balhae]] in early 10th century, so [[Balhae]] fell.\n\n=====Later Three Kingdoms of Korea=====\nThe unified Korean kingdom, Later Silla divided into three kingdoms again because of the corrupt central government. It involves [[Later Goguryeo]](also as known as \"Taebong\"), [[Later Baekje]], and Later Silla. The general of [[Later Goguryeo]], Wang Geon took the thrown and  changed its name into [[Goryeo]], which was derived by the old strong kingdom, Goguryeo, and Goryeo reunified the peninsula.\n\n=====Goryeo(918~1392)=====\n{{main|Goryeo}}\n[[File:Goryo Taejo Wangkun 2.jpg|thumb|left|The first King of [[Goryeo]], as known as [[Taejo of Goryeo]](918~943)]]\n[[Goryeo]] reunited the Korean peninsula during the later three kingdoms period and named itself as 'Empire'. But nowadays, Goryeo is known as a kingdom. The name 'Goryeo' was derived from [[Goguryeo]], and the name [[Korea]] was derived from Goryeo. Goryeo adopted people from fallen [[Balhae]]. They also widened their territory to north by defending Liao dynasty and attacking the [[Jurchen people]]. Goryeo developed a splendid culture. The first metal type printed book [[Jikji]] was also from Korea. The [[Goryeo ware]] is one of the most famous legacies of this kingdom. Goryeo imported Chinese government system and developed into their own ways.\n\nDuring this period, laws were codified and a civil service system was introduced. Buddhism flourished and spread throughout the peninsula. The [[Tripitaka Koreana]] is 81,258 books total. It was made to keep Korea safe against the Mongolian invasion. It is now a UNESCO world heritage. Goryeo won the battle against [[Liao dynasty]]. Then, the [[Mongolian Empire]] invaded Goryeo. Goryeo did not disappear but it had to obey Mongolians. After 80 years, in 14th century, the Mongolian dynasty Yuan lose power, King Gongmin tried to free themselves against Mongol although his wife was also Mongolian. At the 14th century, [[Ming dynasty]] want Goryeo to obey China. But Goryeo didn't. They decided to invade China. Going to China, the general of Goryeo, Lee Sung-Gae came back and destroyed Goryeo and established new dynasty, [[Joseon]]. And he became [[Taejo of Joseon]], which means the first king of [[Joseon]].\n\n\n====Japan====\n{{main|Medieval Japan}}\n[[File:Shotoku Taishi.jpg|thumb|left|Sculpture of [[Prince Sh\u014dtoku]]]]\n\n=====Asuka period=====\nJapan's medieval history began with the [[Asuka period]], from around 600 to 710. The time was characterized by the [[Taika Reform]] and imperial centralization, both of which were a direct result of growing Chinese contact and influences. In 603, [[Prince Sh\u014dtoku]] of the [[Imperial House of Japan|Yamato dynasty]] began significant political and cultural changes. He issued the [[Seventeen-article constitution]] in 604, centralizing power towards the emperor (under the title ''tenno'', or heavenly sovereign) and removing the power to levy taxes from provincial lords. Sh\u014dtoku was also a patron of Buddhism and he encouraged building temples competitively.{{sfn|Bowman|2000|pages=124\u2013137}}\n\n=====Nara period=====\nSh\u014dtoku's reforms transitioned Japan to the [[Nara period]] (c. 710 to c. 794), with the moving of the Japanese capital to [[Nara, Nara|Nara]] in [[Honshu]]. This period saw the culmination of Chinese-style writing, etiquette, and architecture in Japan along with Confucian ideals{{sfn|Stearns|Adas|Schwartz|Gilbert|2011|pages=291\u2013301}} to supplement the already present Buddhism. Peasants revered both Confucian scholars and Buddhist monks. However, in the wake of the [[735\u2013737 Japanese smallpox epidemic]], Buddhism gained the status of state religion and the government ordered the construction of numerous Buddhist temples, monasteries, and statues.{{sfn|Bowman|2000|pages=124\u2013137}} The lavish spending combined with the fact that many aristocrats did not pay taxes, put a heavy burden on peasantry that caused poverty and famine.{{sfn|Bowman|2000|pages=124\u2013137}} Eventually the Buddhist position got out of control, threatening to seize imperial power and causing [[Emperor Kanmu]] to move the capital to [[Heian-ky\u014d]] to avoid a Buddhist takeover.{{sfn|Stearns|Adas|Schwartz|Gilbert|2011|pages=291\u2013301}} This marked the beginning of the [[Heian period]] and the end of Taika reform.\n\n=====Heian period=====\nWith the Heian period (from 794 to 1185) came a decline of imperial power. Chinese influence also declined, as a result of its correlation with imperial centralization and the [[Mandate of Heaven|heavenly mandate]], which came to be regarded as ineffective. By 838, the Japanese court discontinued its embassies in China; only traders and Buddhist monks continued to travel to China. Buddhism itself came to be considered more Japanese than Chinese, and persisted to be popular in Japan. Buddhists monks and monasteries continued their attempts to gather personal power in courts, along with aristocrats. One particular noble family that dominated influence in the imperial bureaucracy was the [[Fujiwara clan]]. During this time cultural life in the imperial court flourished. There was a focus on beauty and social interaction and writing and literature was considered refined. Noblewomen were cultured the same as noblemen, dabbling in creative works and politics. A prime example of both Japanese literature and women's role in high-class culture at this time was ''[[The Tale of Genji]]'', written by the [[lady-in-waiting]] [[Murasaki Shikibu]]. Popularization of wooden palaces and [[sh\u014dji]] sliding doors amongst the nobility also occurred.\n\nLoss of imperial power also led to the rise of provincial warrior elites. Small lords began to function independently. They administered laws, supervised public works projects, and collected revenue for themselves instead of the imperial court. Regional lords also began to build their own armies. These warriors were loyal only their local lords and not the emperor, although the imperial government increasingly called them in to protect the capital. The regional warrior class developed into the [[samurai]], which created its own culture: including specialized weapons such as the [[katana]] and a form of chivalry, [[bushido]]. The imperial government's loss of control in the second half of the Heian period allowed banditry to grow, requiring both feudal lords and Buddhist monasteries to procure warriors for protection. As imperial control over Japan declined, feudal lords also became more independent and seceded from the empire. These feudal states squandered the peasants living in them, reducing the farmers to an almost [[serfdom]] status. Peasants were also rigidly restricted from rising to the samurai class, being physically set off by dress and weapon restrictions. As a result of their oppression, many peasants turned to Buddhism as a hope for reward in the afterlife for upright behavior.{{sfn|Stearns|Adas|Schwartz|Gilbert|2011|pages=296}}\n\nWith the increase of feudalism, families in the imperial court began to depend on alliances with regional lords. The Fujiwara clan declined from power, replaced by a rivalry between the [[Taira clan]] and the [[Minamoto clan]]. This rivalry grew into the [[Genpei War]] in the early 1180s. This war saw the use of both samurai and peasant soldiers. For the samurai, battle was ritual and they often easily cut down the poorly trained peasantry. The Minamoto clan proved successful due to their rural alliances. Once the Taira was destroyed, the Minamoto established a military government called the [[shogunate]] (or bakufu), centered in [[Kamakura, Kanagawa|Kamakura]].\n\n=====Kamakura period=====\nThe end of the Genpei War and the establishment of the [[Kamakura shogunate]] marked the end of the Heian period and the beginning of the [[Kamakura period]] in 1185, solidifying feudal Japan.\n\n\n===Southeast Asia===\n{{main|Medieval Southeast Asia}}\n\n==Early modern==\n{{further|Early modern period}}\n[[File:Modern Asia (1796).tif|thumb|245px|A 1796 map of Asia (or the \"[[Eastern world]]\"), which also included the continent of [[Australia]] (then known as [[New Holland (Australia)|New Holland]]) within its realm.]]\nThe [[Russian Empire]] began to expand into Asia from the 17th century, and would eventually take control of all of [[Siberia]] and most of Central Asia by the end of the 19th century. The [[Ottoman Empire]] controlled Anatolia, the Middle East, North Africa and the Balkans from the 16th century onwards. In the 17th century, the [[Manchu people|Manchu]] conquered China and established the [[Qing Dynasty]]. In the 16th century, the [[Mughal Empire]] controlled much of India and initiated the second golden age for India. China was the largest economy in the world for much of the time, followed by India until the 18th century.\n\n===Ming China===\n\nBy 1368, [[Zhu Yuanzhang]] had claimed himself [[Hongwu Emperor]] and established the Ming dynasty of China. Immediately, the new emperor and his followers drove the Mongols and their culture out of China and beyond the Great Wall.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=503|loc=Chapter 22|quote=Immediately after he seized the throne, Zhu launched an effort to rid China of all traces of the \"barbarian\" Mongols. Mongol dress was discarded, Mongol names were dropped by those who had adopted them and were removed from buildings and court records, and Mongol palaces and administrative buildings in some areas were raided and sacked. The nomads themselves fled or were driven beyond the Great Wall, where military expeditions pursued them on several occasions.}} The new emperor was somewhat suspicious of the scholars that dominated China's bureaucracy, for he had been born a peasant and was uneducated.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=503|loc=Chapter 22|quote=Because the Hongwu emperor, like the founder of the earlier Han dynasty, was from a peasant family and thus poorly educated, he viewed the scholar-gentry with some suspicion.}} Nevertheless, Confucian scholars were necessary to China's bureaucracy and were reestablished as well as reforms that would improve the exam systems and make them more important in entering the bureaucracy than ever before. The exams became more rigorous, cut down harshly on cheating, and those who excelled were more highly appraised. Finally, Hongwu also directed more power towards the role of emperor so as to end the corrupt influences of the bureaucrats.\n\n====Society and economy====\nThe Hongwu emperor, perhaps for his sympathy of the common-folk, had built many irrigation systems and other public projects that provided help for the peasant farmers.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=504|loc=Chapter 22|quote=Perhaps because his lowly origins and personal suffering made him sensitive to the plight of the peasantry, Hongwu introduced measures that would improve the lot of the common people. Like most strong emperors, he promoted public works projects, including dike building and the extension of irrigation systems aimed at improving the farmers' yields.}} They were also allowed to cultivate and claim unoccupied land without having to pay any taxes and labor demands were lowered.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=504|loc=Chapter 22|quote=... Hongwu decreed that unoccupied lands would become the tax-exempt property of those who cleared and cultivated them. He lowered forced labor demands on the peasantry by both the government and members of the gentry class.}} However, none of this was able to stop the rising landlord class that gained many privileges from the government and slowly gained control of the peasantry. Moneylenders foreclosed on peasant debt in exchange for mortgages and bought up farmer land, forcing them to become the landlords' tenants or to wander elsewhere for work.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=505|loc=Chapter 22}} Also during this time, [[Neo-Confucianism]] intensified even more than the previous two dynasties (the Song and Yuan). Focus on the superiority of elders over youth, men over women, and teachers over students resulted in minor discrimination of the \"inferior\" classes. The fine arts grew in the Ming era, with improved techniques in brush painting that depicted scenes of court, city or country life; people such as scholars or travelers; or the beauty of mountains, lakes, or marshes. The Chinese novel fully developed in this era, with such classics written such as ''[[Water Margin]]'', ''[[Journey to the West]]'', and ''[[Jin Ping Mei]]''.\n\nEconomics grew rapidly in the Ming Dynasty as well. The introduction of American crops such as [[maize]], [[sweet potatoes]], and [[peanut]]s allowed for cultivation of crops in infertile land and helped prevent famine. The population boom that began in the Song dynasty accelerated until China's population went from 80 or 90 million to 150 million in three centuries, culminating in 1600.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=507|loc=Chapter 22|quote=By 1600 the population of China had risen to as many as 150 million from 80 to 90 million in the 14th century.}} This paralleled the market economy that was growing both internally and externally. Silk, tea, ceramics, and lacquer-ware were produced by artisans that traded them in Asia and to Europeans. Westerners began to trade (with some Chinese-assigned limits), primarily in the port-towns of [[Macau]] and [[Guangzhou|Canton]]. Although merchants benefited greatly from this, land remained the primary symbol of wealth in China and traders' riches were often put into acquiring more land.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=507|loc=Chapter 22|quote=Much of the merchants' wealth was invested in land rather than plowed back into trade or manufacturing, because land owning, not commerce, remained the surest route to social status in China.}} Therefore, little of these riches were used in private enterprises that could've allowed for China to develop the [[market economy]] that often accompanied the highly-successful Western countries.\n\n====Foreign interests====\n[[File:Fort St. George, Chennai.jpg|thumb|left|A view of the [[Fort St George]] in 18th-century [[Madras]].]]\nIn the interest of national glory, the Chinese began sending impressive [[Junk (ship)|junk]] ships across the [[South China Sea]] and the [[Indian Ocean]]. From 1403 to 1433, the [[Yongle Emperor]] commissioned [[Treasure voyages|expeditions]] led by the admiral [[Zheng He]], a Muslim [[eunuch]] from China. Chinese junks carrying hundreds of soldiers, goods, and animals for zoos, traveled to Southeast Asia, Persia, southern Arabia, and east Africa to show off Chinese power. Their prowess exceeded that of current Europeans at the time, and had these expeditions not ended, the world economy may be different from today.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=339|loc=Chapter 15|quote=There is no question that the course of world history might have been changed dramatically had the Chinese thrust continued, for the tiny European expeditions that began to creep down the western coast of Africa at about the same time would have been no match for this combination of merchant and military organization.}} In 1433, the Chinese government decided that the cost of a navy was an unnecessary expense. The Chinese navy was slowly dismantled and focus on interior reform and military defense began. It was China's longstanding priority that they protect themselves from nomads and they have accordingly returned to it. The growing limits on the Chinese navy would leave them vulnerable to foreign invasion by sea later on.\n\n[[File:Schall-von-bell.jpg|thumb|Here a Jesuit, Adam Schall von Bell (1592\u20131666), is dressed as an official of the Chinese Department of Astronomy.]]\n\nAs was inevitable, Westerners arrived on the Chinese east coast, primarily [[Jesuit]] missionaries which reached the mainland in 1582. They attempted to [[Jesuit China missions|convert the Chinese people to Christianity]] by first converting the top of the social hierarchy and allowing the lower classes to subsequently convert. To further gain support, many Jesuits adopted Chinese dress, customs, and language.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=508|loc=Chapter 22|quote=The Jesuits believed that the best way to convert a great civilization such as China was to adopt the dress, customs, language and manners of its elite.}} Some Chinese scholars were interested in certain Western teachings and especially in Western technology. By the 1580s, Jesuit scholars like [[Matteo Ricci]] and [[Adam Schall]] amazed the Chinese elite with technological advances such as European clocks, improved calendars and cannons, and the accurate prediction of eclipses.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=508|loc=Chapter 22|quote=Beginning in the 1580s, a succession of brilliant Jesuit scholars ... spent most of their time in the imperial city, correcting faulty calendars, forging cannons, fixing clocks imported from Europe, and astounding the Chinese scholar-gentry with the accuracy of their instruments and their ability to predict eclipses.}} Although some the scholar-gentry converted, many were suspicious of the Westerners whom they called \"barbarians\" and even resented them for the embarrassment they received at the hand of Western correction. Nevertheless, a small group of Jesuit scholars remained at the court to impress the emperor and his advisors.\n\n====Decline====\n[[Image:Batavia, C. de Jonghe (1740).jpg|thumb|left|Dutch Batavia in the 17th century, built in what is now [[North Jakarta]]]]\n\nNear the end of the 1500s, the extremely centralized government that gave so much power to the emperor had begun to fail as more incompetent rulers took the mantle. Along with these weak rulers came increasingly corrupt officials who took advantage of the decline. Once more the public projects fell into disrepair due to neglect by the bureaucracy and resulted in floods, drought, and famine that rocked the peasantry. The famine soon became so terrible that some peasants resorted to selling their children to slavery to save them from starvation, or to eating bark, the feces of geese, or [[Cannibalism|other people]].{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=509|loc=Chapter 22|quote=Peasants in afflicted districts were reduced to eating the bark from trees or the excrement of wild geese. Some peasants sold their children into slavery to keep them from starving, and peasants in some areas resorted to cannibalism.}} Many landlords abused the situation by building large estates where desperate farmers would work and be exploited. In turn, many of these farmers resorted to flight, banditry, and open rebellion.\n\nAll of this corresponded with the usual dynastic decline of China seen before, as well as the growing foreign threats. In the mid-16th century, Japanese and ethnic Chinese pirates began to raid the southern coast, and neither the bureaucracy nor the military were able to stop them.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=510|loc=Chapter 22|quote=One of the early signs of the seriousness of imperial deterioration was the inability of Chinese bureaucrats and military forces to put an end to the epidemic of Japanese (and ethnic Chinese) pirate attacks that ravaged the southern coast in the mid-16th century.}} The threat of the northern [[Manchu people]] also grew. The Manchu were an already large state north of China, when in the early 17th century a local leader named [[Nurhaci]] suddenly united them under the [[Eight Banners]]\u2014armies that the opposing families were organized into. The Manchus adopted many Chinese customs, specifically taking after their bureaucracy. Nevertheless, the Manchus still remained a Chinese [[vassal]]. In 1644 Chinese administration became so weak, the 16th and last emperor, the [[Chongzhen Emperor]], did not respond to the severity of an ensuing rebellion by local dissenters until the enemy had invaded the [[Forbidden City]] (his personal estate). He soon hanged himself in the imperial gardens.{{sfn|Stearns|2011|page=510|loc=Chapter 22|quote=By [1644], the administrative apparatus had become so feeble that the last Ming emperor, Chongzhen, did not realize how serious the rebel advance was until enemy soldiers were scaling the walls of the forbidden city. ... the ill-fated Chongzhen retreated to the imperial gardens and hanged himself rather than face capture.}} For a brief amount of time, the [[Shun dynasty]] was claimed, until a loyalist Ming official called support from the Manchus to put down the new dynasty. The Shun Dynasty ended within a year and the Manchu were now within the Great Wall. Taking advantage of the situation, the Manchus marched on the Chinese capital of Beijing. [[Manchu conquest of China|Within two decades]] all of China belonged to the Manchu and the [[Qing dynasty]] was established.\n===Korea: Joseon dynasty(1392~1897)===\n{{Main|Joseon}}\n[[File:Gyeongbokgung-Gyeonghoeru-02.jpg|thumb|left|Gyeonghoeru of [[Gyeongbokgung]], the [[Joseon]] dynasty's royal palace.]]\nIn early-modern Korea, the 500-year-old kingdom, [[Goryeo]] fell and new dynasty [[Joseon]] rose in August 5th, 1392. [[Taejo of Joseon]] changed the country's name from [[Goryeo]] to [[Joseon]]. The fourth king, [[Sejong the Great]] created [[Hangul]], the Korean alphabets by himself in 1443. He also improved science technology as Koreans invent Sun Clocks, Water Clocks, Rain-Measuring system, Star Map, Korean map, and detail records of Korean small villages. He even widened the territory to the north. So nowadays' Korean territory formed at that age. He even attacked Japanese pirates in Tsushima Island, who had been attacking Korea a lot. So he is considered the best king ever in history of Korea. The ninth king, [[Seongjong of Joseon|Seongjong]] accomplished the first complete Korean [[Gyeongguk daejeon|law code]] in 1485. So the culture and people's lives were improved again. \n\nIn 1592, Japan under [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]] invaded Korea. That war is [[Imjin war]]. At that war, Joseon was in a long peace like PAX ROMANA. So Joseon was not ready for the war. Joseon lose again and again. Japanese army conquered [[Seoul]]. The whole [[Korean peninsula]] was in danger. But [[Yi Sun-sin]], the most renowned general of Korea defeated Japanese fleet in southern Korea coast even 13 ships VS 133 ships. This is the legendary battle called \"[[Battle of Myeongnyang]]\". After then, [[Ming dynasty]] helped Joseon and Japan lose the battle. So Japan under Toyotomi Hideyoshi fell, the [[Edo period]] begins. Korea hurt a lot at [[Imjin war]]. Not long after, Manchurian people invaded Joseon again. It is called [[Qing invasion of Joseon]]. First invasion was for sake. Because Qing was at war between Ming, so Ming's alliance Joseon was threatening. And the second invasion was for Joseon to obey Qing. After then, Qing defeated Ming and took the whole Chinese territories. Joseon also had to obey Qing because Joseon lose the second war against Qing.\n\nAfter Qing invasion, the princes of Joseon dynasty lived their childhood in China. The son of king Injo met [[Adam Schall]] in Beijing. So he wanted to introduce western technologies to Korean people when he becomes a king. Unfortunately, he died before he takes the thrown. After then, the alternative prince became the 17th king of Joseon dynasty, Hyojong, trying to revenge for his kingdom and fallen Ming dynasty to Qing. Later kings such as Yeongjo and Jeongjo tried to improve their people's lives and stop the governors' unreasonable competition. From 17th century to 18th century, Joseon sent diplomats and artists to Japan more than 10 times. This group was called 'Tongshinsa'. They were sent to Japan to teach Japan about advanced Korean cultures. Japanese people liked to receive poems from Korean nobles. At that time, Korea was more powerful than Japan. But that relationship between Joseon and Japan was reversed after 19th century. Because Japan became more powerful than Korea and China, either. So Joseon sent diplomats called 'Sooshinsa' to learn Japanese advanced technologies. After king Jeongjo's death, some noble families controlled the whole kingdom in early 19th century. At the end of that period, Western people invaded Joseon. In 1876, Joseon was set free from Qing so they did not have to obey Qing. But Japanese Empire was happy because Joseon became a perfect independent kingdom. So Japan could intervene the kingdom more. After this, Joseon traded with the US and sent 'Sooshinsa' to Japan, 'Youngshinsa' to Qing, and 'Bobingsa' to the US and Europe. These groups took many modern things to Korean peninsula.\n===Japan: Tokugawa or Edo period (1603\u20131867)===\n{{Main|Edo period}}\n[[File:Great Wave off Kanagawa2.jpg|left|thumb|''[[The Great Wave off Kanagawa]]'', c. 1830 by [[Hokusai]], an example of art flourishing in the Edo Period]]\nIn early-modern  Japan following the [[Sengoku period]] of \"warring states\", central government had been largely reestablished by [[Oda Nobunaga]] and [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]] during the [[Azuchi\u2013Momoyama period]]. After the [[Battle of Sekigahara]] in 1600, central authority fell to [[Tokugawa Ieyasu]] who completed this process and received the title of ''[[sh\u014dgun]]'' in 1603.\n\nSociety in the Japanese \"[[Tokugawa shogunate|Tokugawa period]]\" (see [[Edo society]]), unlike the shogunates before it, was based on the strict class [[hierarchy]] originally established by [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]]. The ''[[daimy\u014d]]s'' (feudal lords) were at the top, followed by the warrior-caste of [[samurai]], with the farmers, artisans, and merchants ranking below. The country was strictly closed to foreigners with few exceptions with the ''[[Sakoku]]'' policy. Literacy rose in the two centuries of isolation.<ref>Geoffrey Barraclough and Norman Stone, ''Harper Collins Atlas of World History'' (2003) p 175.</ref>\n\nIn some parts of the country, particularly smaller regions, ''daimy\u014ds'' and samurai were more or less identical, since ''daimy\u014ds'' might be trained as samurai, and samurai might act as local lords. Otherwise, the largely inflexible nature of this [[social stratification]] system unleashed disruptive forces over time. Taxes on the [[peasantry]] were set at fixed amounts which did not account for inflation or other changes in monetary value. As a result, the tax revenues collected by the samurai landowners were worth less and less over time. This often led to numerous confrontations between noble but impoverished samurai and well-to-do peasants. None, however, proved compelling enough to seriously challenge the established order until the arrival of foreign powers.<ref>McClain, ''Japan: A Modern History'' (2002) pp 69-75.</ref>\n\n=== India ===\n{{Main|Mughal Empire|Maratha Empire}}\n[[File:Shah Abbas the Great receiving the Mughal ambassador Khan\u2019Alam in 1618.jpg|thumb|The [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] ambassador Khan\u2019Alam in 1618 negotiating with [[Abbas I of Persia|Shah Abbas the Great]] of [[Safavid dynasty|Iran]]. ]]\nIn the [[Indian subcontinent]], the Mughal Empire ruled most of India in the early 18th century.

During this period, the Empire was marked by a highly centralized administration connecting the different regions. All the significant monuments of the Mughals, their most visible legacy, date to this period which was characterised by the expansion of Persian cultural influence in the Indian subcontinent, with brilliant literary, artistic, and architectural results. The Maratha Empire was located in the south west of present-day India and expanded greatly under the rule of the [[Peshwa]]s, the prime ministers of the Maratha empire. In 1761, the Maratha army lost the [[Third Battle of Panipat]] against [[Shah Ahmad Durrani]] which halted imperial expansion and the empire was then divided into a confederacy of Maratha states.\n\n=== British and Dutch colonization ===\n{{Main|Dutch East India Company|East India Company}}\nThe European economic and naval powers pushed into Asia, first to do trading, and then to take over major colonies. The Dutch led the way followed by the British. Portugal had arrived first, but was too weak to maintain its small holdings and was largely pushed out, retaining only [[Goa]] and [[Macau]]. The British set up a private organization, the [[East India Company]], which handled both trade and Imperial control of much of India.<ref>Holden Furber, ''Rival Empires of Trade in the Orient, 1600\u20131800'' (U of Minnesota Press,  1976). </ref>\n\nThe [[Company rule in India|commercial colonization of India]] commenced in 1757, after the [[Battle of Plassey]], when the [[Nawab of Bengal]] surrendered his dominions to the British East India Company,<ref>{{Harvnb|Bose|Jalal|2003|p=76}}</ref> in 1765, when the Company was granted the ''diwani'', or the right to collect revenue, in [[Bengal]] and [[Bihar]],<ref>{{Harvnb|Brown|1994|p=46}}, {{Harvnb|Peers|2006|p=30}}</ref> or in 1772, when the Company established a capital in [[Calcutta]], appointed its first [[Governor-General of India|Governor-General]], [[Warren Hastings]], and became directly involved in governance.<ref>{{Harvnb|Metcalf|Metcalf|p=56}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Robert Clive and Mir Jafar after the Battle of Plassey, 1757 by Francis Hayman.jpg|left|thumb|[[Robert Clive]] and [[Mir Jafar]] after the [[Battle of Plassey]], 1757 by Francis Hayman]]\n\nThe [[Maratha Empire|Maratha states]], following the [[Anglo-Maratha wars]], eventually lost to the [[British East India Company]] in 1818 with the [[Third Anglo-Maratha War]].

However, their rivalry cooled in 1824 when an [[Anglo-Dutch Treaty of 1824|Anglo-Dutch treaty]] demarcated their respective interests in Southeast Asia. From the 1850s onwards, the pace of colonization shifted to a significantly higher gear.\n\nThe [[Dutch East India Company]] (1800) and [[British East India Company]] (1858) were dissolved by their respective governments, who took over the direct administration of the colonies. Only [[Thailand]] was spared the experience of foreign rule, although, Thailand itself was also greatly affected by the power politics of the Western powers. Colonial rule had a profound effect on Southeast Asia. While the colonial powers profited much from the region's vast resources and large market, colonial rule did develop the region to a varying extent.<ref>Commercial agriculture, mining and an export based economy developed rapidly during this period.</ref>\n\n\n\n==Late modern==\n{{further|Modern history#Late modern period}}\n===Central Asia: The Great Game, Russia vs Great Britain===\n[[File:Great Game cartoon from 1878.jpg|thumb|250px|Political cartoon depicting the Afghan [[Sher Ali Khan|Emir Sher Ali]] with the rival \"friends\" the [[Russian Bear]] and British Lion (1878)]]\n\n[[The Great Game]] was a political and diplomatic confrontation between Great Britain and Russia over [[History of Afghanistan|Afghanistan]] and neighbouring territories in [[Central Asia|Central]] and [[South Asia]]. It lasted from 1828 to 1907.  There was no war, but there were many threats. Russia was fearful of British commercial and military inroads into [[Central Asia]], and Britain was fearful of Russia  threatening its largest and most important possession, India. This resulted in an atmosphere of distrust and the constant threat of war between the two empires.  Britain made it a high priority to protect all the approaches to India, and the \"great game\" is primarily how the British did this in terms of a possible Russian threat.  Historians with access  to the archives have concluded that Russia had no plans involving India, as the Russians repeatedly stated.<ref>Barbara Jelavich, ''St. Petersburg and Moscow: Tsarist and Soviet Foreign Policy, 1814\u20131974'' (1974) p 200</ref>\n\nThe Great Game began in 1838 when Britain decided to gain control over the [[Emirate of Afghanistan]] and make it a protectorate, and to use the [[Ottoman Empire]], the [[Qajar dynasty|Persian Empire]], the [[Khanate of Khiva]], and the Emirate of Bukhara as buffer states between both empires. This would protect India and also key British sea trade routes by stopping Russia from gaining a port on the Persian Gulf or the Indian Ocean.  Russia proposed Afghanistan as the neutral zone, and the final result was diving up Afghanistan with a neutral zone in the middle between Russian areas in the north and British in the South. Important episodes included the failed [[First Anglo-Afghan War]] of 1838, the [[First Anglo-Sikh War]] of 1845, the [[Second Anglo-Sikh War]] of 1848, the [[Second Anglo-Afghan War]] of 1878, and the annexation of [[Khanate of Kokand|Kokand]] by Russia.<ref>* {{cite journal |jstor = 40105749|title = Great Britain's Great Game: An Introduction|journal = The International History Review|volume = 2|issue = 2|pages = 160\u2013171|last1 = Ingram|first1 = Edward|year = 1980|doi = 10.1080/07075332.1980.9640210}}\n</ref> The 1901 novel [[Kim (novel)|''Kim'']] by [[Rudyard Kipling]] made the term popular and introduced the new implication of great power rivalry.

The Manchu Qing emperors, especially Confucian scholar [[Kangxi Emperor|Kangxi]], remained largely conservative\u2014retaining the bureaucracy and the scholars within it, as well as the Confucian ideals present in Chinese society. However, changes in the economy and new attempts at resolving certain issues occurred too. These included increased trade with Western countries that brought large amounts of silver into the Chinese economy in exchange for tea, [[porcelain]], and silk textiles. This allowed for a new merchant-class, the [[comprador]]s, to develop. In addition, repairs were done on existing [[Levee|dikes]], canals, roadways, and [[irrigation]] works. This, combined with the lowering of taxes and government-assigned labor, was supposed to calm peasant unrest. However, the Qing failed to control the growing landlord class which had begun to exploit the peasantry and abuse their position.\n\nBy the late 18th century, both internal and external issues began to arise in Qing China's politics, society, and economy. The exam system with which scholars were assigned into the bureaucracy became increasingly corrupt; bribes and other forms of cheating allowed for inexperienced and inept scholars to enter the bureaucracy and this eventually caused rampant neglect of the peasantry, military, and the previously mentioned infrastructure projects. Poverty and banditry steadily rose, especially in rural areas, and mass migrations looking for work throughout China occurred. The perpetually conservative government refused to make reforms that could resolve these issues.\n\n====Opium War====\n{{Main|First Opium War}}\n\nChina saw its status reduced by what it perceived as parasitic trade with Westerners. Originally, European traders were at a disadvantage because the Chinese cared little for their goods, while European demand for Chinese commodities such as tea and porcelain only grew. In order to tip the trade imbalance in their favor, British merchants began to sell Indian [[opium]] to the Chinese. Not only did this sap Chinese bullion reserves, it also led to widespread drug addiction amongst the [[scholar official|bureaucracy]] and society in general. A ban was placed on opium as early as 1729 by the [[Yongzheng Emperor]], but little was done to enforce it. By the early 19th century, under the new [[Daoguang Emperor]], the government began serious efforts to eradicate opium from Chinese society. Leading this endeavour were respected scholar-officials including [[Imperial Commissioner (China)|Imperial Commissioner]] [[Lin Zexu]].\n\nAfter Lin [[Destruction of opium at Humen|destroyed more than 20,000 chests of opium]] in the summer of 1839, Europeans demanded compensation for what they saw as unwarranted Chinese interference in their affairs. When it was not paid, the British declared war later the same year, starting what became known as the [[First Opium War]]. The outdated Chinese [[Junk (ship)|junks]] were no match for the advanced British gunboats, and soon the [[Yangzi River]] region came under threat of British bombardment and invasion. The emperor had no choice but to sue for peace, resulting in the exile of Lin and the making of the [[Treaty of Nanking]], which ceded the British control of [[Hong Kong]] and opened up trade and diplomacy with other European countries, including Germany, France, and the USA.\n====Inner Manchuria====\n{{Further|Northeast China|{{History of Manchuria}}}}\nNortheast China came under influence of Russia with the building of the [[Chinese Eastern Railway]] through [[Harbin, China|Harbin]] to [[Vladivostok]].<ref>Henry B.  Miller, \"Russian Development of Manchuria.\" ''National Geographic Magazine'' 15 (1904): 113+ [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=lang_en&id=cxQSAAAAYAAJ&oi=fnd&pg=PA113&dq=manchuria+%22port+arthur%22&ots=k-fC6YolIf&sig=sPnaOR2ZzlHvUrI4-dWa41thFj0 online]. </ref> The [[Empire of Japan]] replaced Russian influence in the region as a result of the [[Russo-Japanese War]] in 1904\u20131905, and Japan laid the [[South Manchurian Railway]] in 1906 to [[L\u00fcshunkou|Port Arthur]].  During the [[Warlord Era]] in China, [[Zhang Zuolin]] established himself in Northeast China, but was murdered by the Japanese for being too independent.  The former Chinese  emperor, [[Puyi]], was then placed on the throne to lead a Japanese puppet state of [[Manchukuo]].<ref>Louise Young, ''Japan's Total Empire: Manchuria and the Culture of Wartime Imperialism'' (1999) [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&lr=lang_en&id=YjW41KFGw04C&oi=fnd&pg=PP1&dq=manchuria++japan&ots=ukkqHB3sQy&sig=s5VbuYRGeCmqdOk0grwc3JpxSzo#v=onepage&q=manchuria%20%20japan&f=false excerpt] </ref>  In August 1945, the Soviet Union invaded the region.  From 1945 to 1948, Northeast China was a base area for Mao Zedong's  [[People's Liberation Army]] in the [[Chinese Civil War]].  With the encouragement of the Kremlin, the area was used as a staging ground during the Civil War for the [[Communist Party of China|Chinese Communists]], who were victorious in 1949 and have controlled ever since.<ref>Steven I.

It means the [[Korean Empire]]. And he also promoted himself as an emperor. The new empire accepted more western technology and strengthened military power. Unfortunately, in the [[Russo-Japanese war]], Japan won and started to invade Korea. Japan first stole the right to diplomacy from Korean Empire illegally. But every western country ignored this invasion because they knew Japan became a strong country as they defeated Russian Empire. So emperor Gojong sent diplomats to the Netherlands to let everyone know that Japan stole the Empire's right illegally. But it failed. Japan kicked Gojong off. 3 years after, In 1910, Korean Empire became a part of Empire of Japan. It was the first time ever after invasion of Han dynasty in 108 BC.\n\n\n==Contemporary==\n{{further|Contemporary history}}\n[[File:Asia (late 19th century- early 20th century).jpg|thumb|380px|left|Map of Asia for early 20th century]]\n\nThe European powers had control of other parts of Asia by the early 20th century, such as [[British Raj|British India]], [[French Indochina]], [[Spanish East Indies]], and Portuguese [[Macau]] and [[Goa]]. The [[Great Game]] between Russia and Britain was the struggle for power in the Central Asian region in the nineteenth century. The [[Trans-Siberian Railway]], crossing Asia by train, was complete by 1916. Parts of Asia remained free from European control, although not influence, such as [[Persia]], [[Thailand]] and most of China. In the twentieth century, [[Imperial Japan]] expanded into China and Southeast Asia during the [[World War II]]. After the war, many Asian countries became independent from European powers. During the [[Cold War]], the northern parts of Asia were communist controlled with the [[Soviet Union]] and People's Republic of China, while western allies formed pacts such as [[CENTO]] and [[SEATO]]. Conflicts such as the [[Korean War]], [[Vietnam War]] and [[Soviet\u2013Afghan War|Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]] were fought between communists and anti-communists. In the decades after the Second World War, a massive restructuring plan drove Japan to become the world's second-largest economy, a phenomenon known as the [[Japanese post-war economic miracle]]. The [[Arab\u2013Israeli conflict]] has dominated much of the recent history of the Middle East. After the [[Soviet Union]]'s collapse in 1991, there were many new independent nations in Central Asia.\n\n===China===\n{{main|History of the Republic of China|History of the People's Republic of China}}\nPrior to [[World War II]], China faced a civil war between [[Mao Zedong]]'s Communist party and [[Chiang Kai-shek]]'s nationalist party; the nationalists appeared to be in the lead. However, once the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Japanese invaded]] in 1937, the two parties were forced to form a temporary cease-fire in order to defend China. The nationalists faced many military failures that caused them to lose territory and subsequently, respect from the Chinese masses. In contrast, the communists' use of guerilla warfare (led by [[Lin Biao]]) proved effective against the Japanese's conventional methods and put the Communist Party on top by 1945. They also gained popularity for the reforms they were already applying in controlled areas, including land redistribution, education reforms, and widespread health care. For the next four years, the nationalists would be forced to retreat to the small island east of China, known as [[Taiwan]] (formerly known as Formosa), where they remain today. In mainland China, [[China|People's Republic of China]] was established by the Communist Party, with [[Mao Zedong]] as its [[President of the People's Republic of China|state chairman]].\n\nThe communist government in China was defined by the party [[Professional revolutionaries|cadres]]. These hard-line officers controlled the [[People's Liberation Army]], which itself controlled large amounts of the bureaucracy. This system was further controlled by the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of China|Central Committee]], which additionally supported the state chairman who was considered the head of the government. The People's Republic's foreign policies included the repressing of [[secession]] attempts in Mongolia and Tibet and supporting of [[North Korea]] and [[North Vietnam]] in the [[Korean War]] and [[Vietnam War]], respectively. Additionally, by 1960 China began to cut off its connections with the Soviet Union due to border disputes and an increasing Chinese sense of superiority, especially the personal feeling of Mao over the Russian premier, [[Nikita Khrushchev]].\n\nToday China plays important roles in world economics and politics. China today is the world's second largest economy and the second fastest growing economy.\n==Korea==\n[[File:2018 inter-Korean summit 01.jpg|thumb|right|The third Inter-Korean Summit between South Korean president [[Moon Jae-in]] and North Korean supreme leader [[Kim Jong-un]].

But in 1970, South Korea begins to outrun the North Korean economy. In 2018, South Korea is ranked #10 in world [[GDP]] ranking.\n\n== See also ==\n\n* [[Ancient Asian history]]\n* [[History of Southeast Asia]]\n* {{slink|List of history journals|Asia}}\n* [[Prehistoric Asia]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n\n{{Refbegin}}\n* Best, Antony.

With their new friends, they collaborate to rescue Kazul\u2014now the King of the Dragons\u2014from the wizards who have captured her in the Enchanted Forest.\n\n===Calling on Dragons===\n{{Main|Calling on Dragons}}\nMorwen discovers that the wizards have stolen Mendanbar's sword, which kept them from stealing the Enchanted Forest's magic, and works with Cimorene to retrieve it.\n\n===Talking to Dragons===\n{{Main|Talking to Dragons}}\nDaystar, Cimorene and Mendanbar's son, is sent off into the forest with his father's sword and no knowledge of his heritage.

This short story occurs after the events of ''[[Talking to Dragons]]''.\n\n== Main characters ==\n\n=== Humans ===\n* Cimorene - A highly intelligent and strong-willed princess of Linderwall. The youngest of six beautiful sisters, she is unlike them in both personality and physical appearance, being tall and black-haired rather than blonde and petite.\n* Zemenar - The Head Wizard of the Society of Wizards, given to being devious and under-handed. Grey-haired with a long, grey beard.\n* Antorell -  The son of Zemenar and a fairly incompetent wizard, with brown hair and beard. Antorell is consistently referred to as not being very smart or intimidating, and is easily manipulated by others.\n* Morwen - A practical-minded and highly sensible witch who lives in the Enchanted Forest with her nine cats. She is short, with ginger hair and small square glasses. She infuriates Vamist in the third book with her nine cats (he thinks witches should only have one), none of whom are black, and the fact that she grows plain apples in her garden, among other things.\n* Telemain - An academic magician whose goal in life is to discover the inner workings of every existing type of magic, and has a particular interest in learning the ways of the very secretive wizards. Moderate height with black hair and beard; has a tendency to indulge in overly long and complex technical explanations.\n* Mendanbar - The King of the Enchanted Forest, an intelligent young man who does not particularly enjoy being king or \"being 'Your Majestied' every third word\". Tall and black-haired, marries Cimorene at the end of the second book.\n* Alianora - The Princess of Duchy of Toure-on-Marsh, captured by Woraug, who becomes friends with Cimorene. Petite with crystallized honey hair. A major character in the first book.\n* Vamist - Arona Michaelear Grinogion Vamist is a middle-aged, balding campaigner for traditional magic, causing many citizens of the world of the Enchanted Forest\u2014including but not limited to fire-witches and witches that have more than one cat\u2014to go into hiding, and forcing the rest to conform to his ideas of normalcy. A major character in the third book who meets a rather humorous end.\n* Daystar - Cimorene and Mendabar's only child, fairly tall with black hair like his parents. Daystar is raised in secrecy by Cimorene, thus does not know his heritage, and is greatly confused when the Society of Wizards deems him a threat.\n* Shiara - A fire-witch who aids Prince Daystar in his quest. She is not particularly polite, and frequently mouths off or bursts into tears at the slightest hint of stress due to her unstable fire-witch powers. Hinted that Shiara will end up going through princess training (like Cimorene did) to become Prince Daystar's betrothed and Prince Daystar will have to rescue her from her dragon \"captor\".\n\n=== Dragons ===\n* Kazul - A high-ranking female dragon, with bright green scales, whom Cimorene runs away to work for. She becomes King of the dragons in the first book.\n* Woraug - A distinctly unpleasant bright green dragon, who apparently dislikes Cimorene from the start.\n* Tokoz - King of the Dragons before Kazul; appears only in the first book of the series.\n* Roxim - An older dragon with a manner much like a favored uncle. His allergy to wizards (and their staffs) is particularly severe.\n* Unnamed young dragon - Kazul's grandchild, arguably her \"most irritating\" one, and too young to pick a permanent name; travels with Prince Daystar.\n\n=== Animals ===\n* Murgatroyd - one of Morwen's cats, male, quiet and reserved attitude.\n* Fiddlesticks - one of Morwen's cats, seal brown male, large appetite (particularly for fish), fairly nosy when he's not involved in a conversation.\n* Miss Eliza Tudor - one of Morwen's cats, white and fluffy female with blue eyes, as polite as can be expected.\n* Scorn - one of Morwen's cats, calico female, lives up to her name, forms a relationship with Horatio.\n* Jasmine - one of Morwen's cats, ginger female, lazy.\n* Trouble - one of Morwen's cats, a large grey tom with a crooked tail and ragged ear, expresses some jealousy towards Horatio, generally lives up to his name.\n* Jasper Darlington Higgins IV - one of Morwen's cats, cream and silver male.\n* Chaos - one of Morwen's cats, grey long-haired tabby male, described as fat.\n* Aunt Ophelia - one of Morwen's cats, spiky tortoiseshell female, speaks like a Southern Belle.\n* Quiz - one of Morwen's cats, child of Scorn, also known as the Grand Inquisitor. Black and white, possibly a son of Horatio.\n* Cassandra - one of Morwen's cats, child of Scorn, grey female, not very noticeable. (Possibly a daughter of Trouble, as Horatio and Scorn would have produced only black and white offspring.)\n* Grendel - cat belonging to the witch Archaniz, fat black male, not very intelligent.\n* Horatio - cat belonging to Brandel (a fire witch), black male with white paws and chin, forms a relationship with Scorn.\n* Nightwitch - kitten belonging to Shiara, gifted by Morwen to her. She appears similar to Horatio and Quiz, is more than likely one of their descendants.\n* Killer - rabbit that is affected by a number of spells throughout the book [[Calling on Dragons]], by the end being a 7-foot 11-inch blue floating insubstantial winged donkey.\n* Suz: A small gold (and very energetic) lizard that helps guide Daystar in [[Talking to Dragons]].\n\n== Minor characters ==\n\n=== Non-dragon people ===\n:''Various '''fairies, elves, giants and dwarves''' appear throughout the series, and are considered as people.''\n* Ballimore the Giantess and Dobbilan the Giant - Along with her husband, one of Kazul's and Cimorene's friends.

Her husband Dobbilan gives up his pillaging lifestyle for consulting after meeting Mendabar. While mentioned several times in other books, she makes her first appearance in Searching for Dragons (along with Dobbilan).\n* Herman (the dwarf) - Herman is a descendant of Rumpelstiltskin, with the same talents, but keeps ending up with children after no one was able to remember his name, even after he changed it. He lends Cimorene and Mendabar the use of a scrying window in Searching for Dragons. He is acquainted with Telemain, from whom Herman bought his home.\n* Gypsy Jack - A human trader who operates from a multi-colored wagon, specializing in the repair of magical goods; Cimorene and Mendabar make use of this talent when needing repairs for their magic carpet. Jack is a friend of the magician Telemain; first appears in Searching for Dragons.\n* Brandel - A human fire-witch who lives in the Smoky Swamp, having moved there to get away from Vamist and his pursuits. Like most fire-witches, he can set his hair ablaze without a thought, usually when he gets worked up and angry over a slight. Brandel aids Morwen and Cimorene in Calling on Dragons.\n* Willin - Mendabar's steward, and undoubtedly the hardest-working employee of the castle. Willin is a pleasant elf who enjoys formal occasions and is annoyed when the King leaves without warning (which appears to happen often enough that he has a valid complaint). Willin spends much of his time in the books chastising the King and Queen.\n* Archaniz - Chairwitch of the Deadly Nightshade Gardening Club; maintains the \"traditional\" witch look (black hat, hair, eyes, long nose, etc.). Grows ordinary daisies in her garden (as well as Giant Weaselweeds), and dislikes Vamist's intentions as she believes he will cause witches to be viewed as benevolent instead of maligning (though Morwen is fairly benevolent).\n* Wully and Kanikak - Two other witches mentioned briefly as part of the Deadly Nightshade Gardening Club. One grows smokeblossoms and the other Midnight fire-flowers.\n* The Stone Prince - A prince, destined to do a great service for a king, who goes on a quest for the Water of Life which is found in the dragons' Caves of Fire and Night, and suffers complications that turn him into living stone. He later marries Alianora, a friend of Cimorene's; he also plays a crucial role in discovering the wizards' plot in the first book. We never learned his real name.\n* Therandill -Prince of Sathem-by-the-Mountain. \"...golden Haired, blue eyes and exceedingly handsome...\", but he \"isn't anything else\" Cimorene's parents arranged their betrothal against Cimorene's wishes which what was prompted her to leave.
