The final game pitted [[Mike Bielecki]] against a well-rested (due to his quick exit from Game 2) [[Rick Reuschel]]. Reuschel made amends for his poor start in Game 2 by giving up only one run over eight innings. The one run Reuschel gave up was an unearned run the Cubs scored when Walton reached on an error by Mitchell and then scored on Sandberg's double. The Cubs held the 1-0 lead until the seventh inning when [[Will Clark]] tripled and scored on Mitchell's sacrifice fly.\n\nThe Cubs did rally, however, in the ninth with three straight singles that made it 3-2.

The final game pitted [[Mike Bielecki]] against a well-rested (due to his quick exit from Game 2) [[Rick Reuschel]]. Reuschel made amends for his poor start in Game 2 by giving up only one run over eight innings. The one run Reuschel gave up was an unearned run the Cubs scored when Walton reached on an error by Mitchell and then scored on Sandberg's double. The Cubs held the 1-0 lead until the seventh inning when [[Will Clark]] tripled and scored on Mitchell's sacrifice fly.\n\nThe Cubs did rally, however, in the ninth with three straight singles that made it 3-2. But Sandberg grounded out sending the Giants to their first [[1989 World Series|World Series]] since [[1962 World Series|1962]].\n\n==Awards and honors==\n* [[Ryne Sandberg]], National League Leader, Runs (104)\n\n'''[[1989 Major League Baseball All-Star Game|All-Star Game]]'''\n* [[Ryne Sandberg]], Second Base, Starter\n* [[Andre Dawson]], Outfield, Reserve\n* [[Rick Sutcliffe]], Pitcher, Reserve\n* [[Mitch Williams (baseball)|Mitch Williams]], Relief Pitcher, Reserve\n\n== Farm system ==\n{{See also|Minor League Baseball}}\n\n{{MLB Farm System|level14=[[Triple-A (baseball)|AAA]]|team14=[[Iowa Cubs]]|league14=[[American Association (20th century)|American Association]]|manager14=[[Pete Mackanin]] \n|level15=[[Double-A (baseball)|AA]] |team15=[[Charlotte Knights]]|league15=[[Southern League (baseball)|Southern League]]|manager15=[[Jim Essian]] \n|level16=[[Single-A (baseball)|A]]  |team16=[[Winston-Salem Dash|Winston-Salem Spirits]]|league16=[[Carolina League]]|manager16=[[Jay Loviglio]]\n|level17=[[Single-A (baseball)|A]]  |team17=[[Peoria Chiefs]]|league17=[[Midwest League]]|manager17=[[Brad Mills (infielder)|Brad Mills]]\n|level18=[[Single-A (baseball)|A]]|team18=[[Charleston Wheelers]]|league18=[[South Atlantic League]]|manager18=[[Greg Mahlberg]]\n|level19=[[Class A-Short Season|A-Short Season]]|team19=[[Geneva Cubs]]|league19=[[New York\u2013Penn League]]|manager19=[[Bill Hayes (baseball)|Bill Hayes]]\n|level20=[[Rookie League|Rookie]]|team20=[[Wytheville Cubs]]|league20=[[Appalachian League]]|manager20=[[Steve Roadcap]]\n}}<ref>Johnson, Lloyd, and Wolff, Miles, ed., ''The Encyclopedia of Minor League Baseball'', 2nd edition.

Virtually every type of entertainment appeared on the show; classical musicians, [[opera]] singers, popular recording artists, songwriters, comedians, [[ballet]] dancers, dramatic actors performing [[monologues]] from plays, and [[Circus (performing art)|circus]] acts were regularly featured. The format was essentially the same as [[vaudeville]] and, although vaudeville had undergone a slow demise for a generation, Sullivan presented many ex-vaudevillians on his show.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.edsullivan.com/show-history |title=History of the Ed Sullivan Show &#124; Ed Sullivan Show |website=Edsullivan.com |date=1964-02-09 |accessdate=2016-10-28}}</ref>\n\nOriginally co-created and produced by [[Marlo Lewis]], the show was first titled '''''Toast of the Town''''', but was widely referred to as ''The Ed Sullivan Show'' for years before September 25, 1955, when that became its official name. In the show's June 20, 1948 debut, [[Dean Martin]] and [[Jerry Lewis]] performed along with singer [[Monica Lewis]] and [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] composers [[Richard Rodgers]] and [[Oscar Hammerstein II]] previewing the score to their then-new show ''[[South Pacific (musical)|South Pacific]]'', which opened on Broadway in 1949.\n\nFrom 1948 through 1962, the program's primary sponsor was the [[Mercury (automobile)|Lincoln-Mercury Division]] of the [[Ford Motor Company]]; Sullivan read many commercials for Mercury vehicles live on the air during this period.\n\n''The Ed Sullivan Show'' was originally broadcast via [[live television]] from CBS-TV studio 51, the [[Maxine Elliott Theatre]], at [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]] and 39th St. before moving to its permanent home at CBS-TV Studio 50 in New York City (1697 Broadway, at 53rd Street), which was renamed the [[Ed Sullivan Theater]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.edsullivan.com/ed-sullivan-theater |title=Ed Sullivan Theater &#124; Ed Sullivan Show |website=Edsullivan.com |date= |accessdate=2016-10-28}}</ref> on the occasion of the program's 20th anniversary in June 1968. The last original Sullivan show telecast (#1068) was on March 28, 1971, with guests [[Melanie Safka|Melanie]], [[Joanna Simon (singer)|Joanna Simon]], [[Danny Davis (country musician)|Danny Davis and the Nashville Brass]] and [[Sandler and Young]]. Repeats were scheduled through June 6, 1971.\n\n==Background==\nAlong with the new talent Sullivan booked each week, he also had recurring characters appear many times a season, such as his \"Little Italian Mouse\" puppet sidekick [[Topo Gigio]], who debuted December 9, 1962,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.edsullivan.com/artists/topo-gigio |title=Products Page &#124; Ed Sullivan Show |website=Edsullivan.com |date= |accessdate=2016-10-28}}</ref> and [[ventriloquist]] [[Se\u00f1or Wences]] debuted December 31, 1950.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.edsullivan.com/artists/senor-wences |title=Products Page &#124; Ed Sullivan Show |website=Edsullivan.com |date=1950-12-31 |accessdate=2016-10-28}}</ref> While most of the episodes aired live from New York City, the show also aired live on occasion from other nations, such as the United Kingdom, Australia, and Japan. For many years, ''Ed Sullivan'' was a national event each Sunday evening, and was the first exposure for foreign performers to the American public.\nOn the occasion of the show's tenth anniversary telecast, Sullivan commented on how the show had changed during a June 1958 interview syndicated by the [[Newspaper Enterprise Association]] (NEA):\n{{quote|The chief difference is mostly one of pace. In those days, we had maybe six acts. Now we have 11 or 12. Then, each of our acts would do a leisurely ten minutes or so. Now they do two or three minutes. And in those early days I talked too much. Watching these [[kinescope|kines]] I cringe. I look up at me talking away and I say \"You fool!  Keep quiet!\"  But I just keep on talking. I've learned how to keep my mouth shut.}}\n\nThe show enjoyed phenomenal popularity in the 1950s and early 1960s. As had occurred with the annual telecasts of ''[[The Wizard of Oz on television|The Wizard of Oz]]'' in the 1960s and '70s, the family ritual of gathering around the television set to watch Ed Sullivan became almost a U.S. cultural universal. He was regarded as a kingmaker, and performers considered an appearance on his program as a guarantee of stardom, although this sometimes did not turn out to be the case. The show's iconic status is illustrated by the song \"Hymn for a Sunday Evening\" from the 1960 musical ''[[Bye Bye Birdie (musical)|Bye Bye Birdie]]''.  In the song, a family of viewers expresses their regard for the program in worshipful tones.\n\nIn September 1965, CBS started televising the program in [[compatible color]], as all three major networks began to switch to 100 percent color prime time schedules. CBS had once backed its own color system, developed by [[Peter Carl Goldmark|Peter Goldmark]], and resisted using RCA's compatible process until 1954. At that time, it built its first New York City color TV studio, Studio 72, in a former [[RKO Pictures|RKO]] movie theater at 2248 Broadway (81st Street).  One ''Ed Sullivan Show'' was broadcast on August 22, 1954, from the new studio, but it was mostly used for one-time-only specials such as [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]]'s March 31, 1957 ''[[Cinderella (Rodgers and Hammerstein musical)|Cinderella]]''. (The facility was later acquired by TeleTape Productions and notably became the first studio where the PBS children's program ''[[Sesame Street]]'' was produced.) CBS Studio 72 was demolished in 1986 and replaced by an apartment house. CBS Studio 50 was finally \"colorized\" in 1965.  The 1965\u201366 season premiere starred the Beatles in an episode airing on September 12, which was the last episode to air in black and white.  This occurred because the episode was taped at the Beatles' convenience on August 14, the eve of their Shea Stadium performance and a two-week tour of North America,  slightly before the program was ready for color transmission.\n\nIn the late 1960s, Sullivan remarked that his program was waning as the decade went on. He realized that to keep viewers, the best and brightest in entertainment had to be seen, or else the viewers were going to keep on changing the channel. Along with declining viewership, ''Ed Sullivan'' attracted a higher median age for the average viewer (which most sponsors found undesirable) as the seasons went on. These two factors were the reason the show was cancelled by CBS on March 16, 1971 as part of a [[rural purge|mass cancellation of advertiser-averse programming]].  While Sullivan's landmark program ended without a proper finale, Sullivan would produce one-off specials for [[CBS]] until his death in 1974, including an ''Ed Sullivan Show'' 25th anniversary special in 1973.\n\nIn 1990, television documentary producer [[Andrew Solt]] formed SOFA Entertainment, Inc. and purchased the exclusive rights to the complete library of ''The Ed Sullivan Show'' from [[Ed Sullivan]]'s daughter Elizabeth and her husband Bob Precht.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/Entertainment_News/TV/2011/07/20/Comic-icons-pay-tribute-to-Ed-Sullivan/UPI-20741311209902/ |title=Comic Icons Pay Tribute to The Ed Sullivan Show |publisher=[[United Press International]] |date= |accessdate=2011-07-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/12/technology/12video.html?_r=3& |title=Who Owns the Live Music of Days Gone By? |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=2007-03-12 }}</ref>  The collection consists of 1,087 hours of [[kinescopes]] and videotapes broadcast by CBS on Sunday nights from 1948 to 1971.\n \nSince acquiring the rights to ''The Ed Sullivan Show'' library, SOFA Entertainment has catalogued, organized and cleared performance rights for the original shows.  Starting in 1991, SOFA Entertainment has re-introduced ''The Ed Sullivan Show'' to the American public by producing numerous network specials, half-hour series (airing on TV Land, [[PBS]], [[VH1]] and [[Decades (TV network)|Decades]]) and home video compilations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.edsullivan.com/sofa-entertainment |title=SOFA Entertainment |publisher=edsullivan.com |date= |accessdate=2008-01-12   }}</ref>  Some of these compilations include ''The 4 Complete Ed Sullivan Shows Starring The Beatles'', ''All 6 Ed Sullivan Shows Starring The Rolling Stones'', ''Elvis: The Ed Sullivan Shows'', ''Motown Gold from the Ed Sullivan Show'', ''Ed Sullivan's Rock 'n Roll Classics'', and 115 half-hour ''The Best of The Ed Sullivan Show'' specials, among others.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/467573/rolling-stones-really-big-ed-sullivan-shows-getting-released-exclusive |title=Rolling Stones Really Big Ed Sullivan Shows |publisher=billboard.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-07 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2062594/ |title=Motown Gold From The Ed Sullivan Show |website=IMDb.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-13 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.imdb.com/title/tt2098807/ |title=Six Ed Sullivan Shows Starring The Rolling Stones |website=IMDb.com|date= |accessdate=2011-11-01 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0892050/ |title=Elvis: The Ed Sullivan Shows |website=IMDb.com|accessdate=2006-11-21}}</ref>  The legendary performances of this show are also available as video and audio downloads and as an app on [[iTunes]].\"<ref>{{cite web|url=  http://ax.search.itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZSearch.woa/wa/search?entity=musicVideo&media=all&page=1&restrict=true&startIndex=0&term=ed+sullivan+show |title=iTunes The Ed Sullivan Show |publisher=itunes.apple.com |date= |accessdate=2009-07-06}}</ref>\n\n=== The Ed Sullivan Show Orchestra ===\nIn the early years of television, both CBS and NBC networks had their own symphony orchestras. NBC's was conducted by [[Arturo Toscanini]] and CBS's by [[Alfredo Antonini]]. ''The Ed Sullivan Show''  (originally presented as: ''The Toast Of The Town'') was basically a musical variety show, and thus members of the CBS orchestra were folded into the Ed Sullivan Show Orchestra, conducted by Ray Bloch. During the early days of television, the demands on studio musicians were many-tiered. They needed to be proficient in all genres of music, from classical, to jazz and to rock and roll. ''The Ed Sullivan Show'' would regularly feature singers from the Metropolitan Opera and the staff orchestra would accompany divas such as [[Eileen Farrell]], [[Maria Callas]] or [[Joan Sutherland]]. The musicians needed to be prepared to switch gears for [[Ella Fitzgerald]], [[Diahann Carroll]] or [[Sammy Davis Jr.|Sammy Davis, Jr]]. and then onto [[The Jackson 5ive (TV series)|The Jackson Five]], [[Stevie Wonder]] or [[Tom Jones (singer)|Tom Jones]] or [[Itzhak Perlman]]. They also needed to perform with some of the greatest dancers and ballerinas of the time, from [[Gregory Hines]], [[Juliet Prowse]], [[Maria Tallchief]] <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/obituaries/maria-tallchief-ballet-star-who-was-inspiration-for-balanchine-dies-at-88/2013/04/12/5888f3de-c5dc-11df-94e1-c5afa35a9e59_story.html|title=Maria Tallchief, ballet star who was inspiration for Balanchine, dies at 88|first=Sarah|last=Halzack|date=12 April 2013|publisher=|via=www.washingtonpost.com}}</ref> or [[Margot Fonteyn|Margo Fonteyn]] to the [[Peter Gennaro]] dancers.\nIn the process, the musicians collaborated with several internationally recognized ballet troupes including: [[Ruth Page (ballerina)|Ruth Page]]'s [[Chicago Ballet|Chicago Opera Ballet]], the [[London Festival Ballet]], [[Roland Petit]]'s Ballets de Paris and Russia's [[Igor Moiseyev]] Ballet.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/televisionperfor00rose/page/42 ''Television and the Performing Arts - A Handbook and Reference Guide to American Cultural Programming'' Greenwood Press, New York, 1986, p. 35 Rose, Brian Jeffrey.  The Ed Sullivan Show, Ruth Page Chicago opera Baller, Roland Petit's Ballet and Igor Moiseyev Ballet  on books.google.com] {{ISBN|0-313-24159-7}}</ref>  Few musicians are capable of crossing over from one genre to another. However, each member of the Ed Sullivan Show Orchestra was a specialist and more than capable of covering the complete spectrum of music.\n\n'''<u>The lead trumpet player</u>''' is the \u201cconcert master\u201d of a studio orchestra. [[Chris Griffin (musician)|Chris Griffin]] (formerly with the trumpet section of [[Harry James]], [[Ziggy Elman]] and the [[Benny Goodman]] Band) was [[Ray Bloch]]'s lead trumpet player for the many radio and television shows that he conducted, including the ''Ed Sullivan Show''. \"Chris\" remained the lead trumpet player with ''The Ed Sullivan show'' from the first show in 1948 to the last show in 1971. The '''Trumpet Section''' was composed of: Chris Griffin; Bernie Privin; Jimmy Nottingham and Thad Jones. Chris' son Paul Griffin was a regular substitute trumpeter. '''Trombones''': Roland Dupont; Morton Bullman; Frank Rehak and Cliff Heather. '''Saxes''': Toots Mondello; Hymie Schertzer; etc. '''Piano''': Hank Jones. '''Drums''': Specs Powell/Howard Smith. '''Percussion''': Milton Schlesinger who similarly played from the first to last show. [[John Serry Sr.]] often augmented the orchestra as the lead accordionist during the 1950s. Unlike NBC's ''[[The Tonight Show]]'', which celebrated the notoriety of their musicians in [[Skitch Henderson]]'s or [[Doc Severinsen]]'s \"Tonight Show Band\", the CBS producers of ''The Ed Sullivan Show'' decided to hide their famed musicians behind a curtain. Occasionally, CBS would broadcast specials and call upon the orchestra to perform. When [[Robert Kennedy]] was assassinated, music was hastily composed for the orchestra in a special tribute that also featured [[Bill Evans]], who had recently composed an Elegy To His Father. In 1971, ''The Ed Sullivan Show'' came to an abrupt end. The CBS board of directors chose this occasion to terminate any and all contracts with their musicians as they were unceremoniously shown the door.\n\n==Famous performances/notable guest stars==\n[[File:Beatles with Ed Sullivan.jpg|thumb|Sullivan and The Beatles, February 1964]]\n''The Ed Sullivan Show'' is especially known to the World War II and [[baby boomer]] generations for introducing acts and airing breakthrough performances by popular 1950s and 1960s musicians such as [[Elvis Presley]], [[The Beatles]], [[The Supremes]], [[The Dave Clark Five]], [[The Animals]], [[Creedence Clearwater Revival]], [[The Beach Boys]], [[The Jackson 5]], [[Stevie Wonder]], [[Janis Joplin]], [[The Rolling Stones]], [[The Mamas and the Papas]], [[The Lovin' Spoonful]], [[Herman's Hermits]], [[The Doors]], [[Barbra Streisand]] and [[The Band]]. The Canadian comedy duo [[Wayne and Shuster]] appeared on the program 67 times, a record for any performer.<ref>[http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/wayne-and-shuster/ \"Wayne and Shuster\" ] ''The Canadian Encyclopedia''.  Charles Dougall, 02/07/2006</ref>\n\n===Itzhak Perlman===\nThe American public's first exposure to [[Itzhak Perlman]] was on the show in 1958, when he was 13.  This performance was a breakthrough not only for classical music, but also for Perlman, who rode the waves of admiration that came with performing on the show to new heights of fame and has remained one of the most famous violinists for decades.\n\n===Elvis Presley===\n\n====Initial appearance====\nOn September 9, 1956, Presley made his first appearance on ''The Ed Sullivan Show'' (after earlier appearances on shows hosted by the [[Stage Show (TV series)|Dorsey Brothers]], [[Milton Berle]], and [[Steve Allen]]), even though Sullivan had previously vowed never to allow Presley on the show.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.edsullivan.com/artists/elvis-presley |title=Products Page &#124; Ed Sullivan Show |website=Edsullivan.com |date= |accessdate=2016-10-28}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Sullivan biographer Michael David Harris, \"Sullivan signed Presley when the host was having an intense Sunday-night rivalry with Steve Allen. Allen had the singer on July 1 and trounced Sullivan in the ratings. When asked to comment, [Sullivan] said that he wouldn't consider presenting Presley before a family audience. Less than two weeks later he changed his mind and signed a contract. The newspapers asked him to explain his reversal. 'What I said then was off the reports I'd heard. I hadn't even seen the guy. Seeing the kinescopes, I don't know what the fuss was all about. For instance, the business about rubbing the thighs. He rubbed one hand on his hip to dry off the perspiration from playing his guitar.' \"<ref name=Harris116>{{cite book |title=Always on Sunday: Ed Sullivan, An Inside View |url=https://archive.org/details/alwaysonsundayed00harr |url-access=registration |last=Harris |first=Michael David |year=1968 |publisher=Meredith Press|location=New York |page=[https://archive.org/details/alwaysonsundayed00harr/page/116 116]}}</ref>\n\nSullivan's reaction to Presley's performance on ''[[The Milton Berle Show]]'' was, \"I don't know why everybody picked on Presley, I thought the whole show was dirty and vulgar.\"<ref name=\"American Idol 2005. page 16\">''TV A-Go-Go: Rock on TV from American Bandstand to American Idol''.

Sullivan, however, was not able to host his show in New York City because he was recovering from a near fatal automobile accident. [[Charles Laughton]] guest-hosted in Sullivan's place. Laughton appeared in front of plaques with gold records and stated, \"These gold records, four of them... are a tribute to the fact that four of his recordings have sold, each sold, more than a million copies. And this, by the way, is the first time in record-making history that a singer has hit such a mark in such a short time. ...

Laughton had to make the moment invisible: to act as if nobody was actually waiting for anything.

Once on camera, Elvis cleared his throat and said, \"Thank you, Mr. Laughton, ladies and gentlemen. Wow\", and wiped his brow. \"This is probably the greatest honor I've ever had in my life. Ah. There's not much I can say except, it really makes you feel good. We want to thank you from the bottom of our heart.

We know that somewhere out there you are looking in, and, ah, all the boys and myself, and everybody out here, are looking forward to seeing you back on television.\" Next, Elvis declared, \"Friends, as a great philosopher once said, 'You ain't nothin' but a [[Hound Dog (song)|Hound Dog]] ...,' \" as he launched into a short (1:07) version of the song.<ref name=\"Elvis Presley - Ed Sullivan Shows\"/>\n\nAccording to Marcus, \"For the first of his two appearances that night, as a performer Elvis had come on dressed in grandma's nightgown and nightcap.\" Concerning the singer's second set in the show, the author adds that there were \"Elvis, Scotty Moore on guitar, Bill Black on stand-up bass, D.

Elvis performed \"[[Don't Be Cruel]]\", then \"[[Love Me Tender (song)|Love Me Tender]]\". Sullivan then addressed the audience as he stood beside Elvis, who began shaking his legs, eliciting screams from the audience. By the time Sullivan turned his head, Elvis was standing motionless. After Presley left the stage, Sullivan stated, \"I can\u2019t figure this darn thing out. You know. He just does this [Ed shakes his legs] and everybody yells.\" Elvis appeared a second time in the show and sang \"[[Love Me (Leiber/Stoller song)|Love Me]]\". Later on, he sang a nearly four-minute-long version of \"[[Hound Dog (song)|Hound Dog]]\" and was shown in full the entire song.\n\nFor the third and final appearance on January 6, 1957, Presley performed a medley of \"[[Hound Dog (song)|Hound Dog]]\", \"[[Love Me Tender (song)|Love Me Tender]]\", and \"[[Heartbreak Hotel]]\", followed by a full version of \"[[Don't Be Cruel]]\". For a second set later in the show he did \"Too Much\" and \"[[When My Blue Moon Turns to Gold Again]]\". For his last set he sang \"[[Peace in the Valley]]\". According to Sullivan's co-producer [[Marlo Lewis]], the rumor had it that \"Elvis has been hanging a small soft-drink bottle from his groin underneath his pants, and when he wiggles his leg it looks as though his pecker reaches down to his knee!\"<ref>See Marlo Lewis and Mina Beth Lewis, ''Prime Time'' (1979), p.146.</ref> It was decided to shoot the singer only from the waist while he performed. Although much has been made of the fact that Elvis was shown only from the waist up, except for the short section of \"[[Hound Dog (song)|Hound Dog]]\", all of the songs on this show were ballads. \"Leaving behind the bland clothes he had worn on the first two shows\", Greil Marcus says, Elvis \"stepped out in the outlandish costume of a pasha, if not a harem girl. From the make-up over his eyes, the hair falling in his face, the overwhelmingly sexual cast of his mouth, he was playing [[Rudolph Valentino]] in ''The Sheik'', with all stops out. That he did so in front of the Jordanaires, who this night appeared as the four squarest-looking men on the planet, made the performance even more potent.\"<ref>Marcus, \"Elvis Presley: The Ed Sullivan Shows\".</ref>\n\nSullivan praised Elvis at the end of the show, saying \"This is a real decent, fine boy.

He phoned Presley's manager, Col. Tom Parker, and asked about a price. Parker came up with a list of instructions and conditions and after hearing the demands Sullivan said, 'Give Elvis my best\u2014and my sympathy,' and he hung up.\"<ref name=\"Harris116\" /> The singer never again appeared in Sullivan's show, although in February 1964 at the start of the first of three broadcasts featuring the Beatles (see below), Sullivan announced that a telegram had been received from Presley and Parker wishing the British group luck.\n\n==={{anchor|Beatles}}The Beatles===\n[[File:Ed Sullivan-Beatles-Help.jpg|thumb|right|The Beatles performing \"Help!\" in August 1965.]]\nIn late 1963, Sullivan and his entourage happened also to be passing through [[London Heathrow Airport|Heathrow]] and witnessed how [[The Beatles]]' fans greeted the group on their return from Stockholm, where they had performed a television show as warmup band to local stars [[:nl:Suzie|Suzie]] and [[Lill Babs]]. Sullivan was intrigued, telling his entourage it was the same thing as Elvis all over again. He initially offered Beatles manager [[Brian Epstein]] top dollar for a single show but the Beatles manager had a better idea \u2014 he wanted exposure for his clients: the Beatles would instead appear three times on the show, for only a minimal fee, but receive top billing and two spots (opening and closing) on each show.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.edsullivan.com/artists/The-Beatles |title=Products Page &#124; Ed Sullivan Show |website=Edsullivan.com |date= |accessdate=2016-10-28}}</ref>\n\nThe Beatles appeared on three consecutive Sundays in February 1964 to great anticipation and fanfare as \"[[I Want to Hold Your Hand]]\" had swiftly risen to No. 1 in the charts. Their first appearance on February 9 is considered also along with the appearance of Elvis Presley a few years earlier on that show a milestone in American pop culture and furthermore the beginning of the [[British Invasion]] in music. The broadcast drew an estimated 73 million viewers, at the time a record for US television which would not be broken until three years later by the series finale of ''[[The Fugitive (TV series)|The Fugitive]]''. The Beatles followed Ed's show opening intro, performing \"[[All My Loving]].\" \"[[Till There Was You]],\" which featured the names of the group members superimposed on closeup shots, including the famous \"''SORRY GIRLS, HE'S MARRIED''\" caption on [[John Lennon]]; and \"[[She Loves You]].\" The act that followed Beatles in the broadcast, magician [[Fred Kaps]], was pre-recorded in order to allow time for an elaborate set change.<ref>Spizer, Bruce.

New Orleans, Louisiana: 498 Productions, 2003.  {{ISBN|0-9662649-8-3}} (paperback).</ref> The group returned later in the program to perform \"[[I Saw Her Standing There]]\" and \"[[I Want to Hold Your Hand]].\"\n\nThe following week's show was broadcast from [[Miami Beach]] where Cassius Clay (later known as [[Muhammad Ali]]) was in training for his first title bout with [[Sonny Liston]]. The occasion was used by both camps for publicity. On the evening of the television show (February 16) a crush of people nearly prevented the band from making it onstage. A wedge of policemen were needed and the band began playing \"[[She Loves You]]\" only seconds after reaching their instruments. They continued with \"[[This Boy]],\" and \"[[All My Loving]]\" and returned later to close the show with \"[[I Saw Her Standing There]],\" \"[[From Me to You]]\" and \"[[I Want to Hold Your Hand]].\"\n\nThey were shown on tape February 23 (this appearance had been taped earlier in the day on February 9 before their first live appearance). They followed Ed's intro with \"[[Twist and Shout]]\" and \"[[Please Please Me (song)|Please Please Me]]\" and closed the show once again with \"[[I Want to Hold Your Hand]].\"\n\nThe Beatles appeared live for the final time on August 14, 1965. The show was broadcast September 12, 1965, and earned Sullivan a 60-percent share of the nighttime audience for [[List of most-watched television episodes|one of the appearances]]. This time they followed three acts before coming out to perform \"[[I Feel Fine]],\" \"[[I'm Down]],\" and \"[[Act Naturally]]\" and then closed the show with \"[[Ticket to Ride]],\" \"[[Yesterday (Beatles song)|Yesterday]],\" and \"[[Help! (song)|Help!]]\" Although this was their final live appearance on the show, the group would, for several years, provide filmed [[music video|promotional clip]]s of songs to air exclusively on Sullivan's program such as the 1966 and 1967 clips of \"[[Paperback Writer]],\" \"[[Rain (The Beatles song)|Rain]],\" \"[[Penny Lane]],\" \"[[Strawberry Fields Forever]],\" and \"[[Hello, Goodbye]].\" The group's last appearance on Sullivan's program was via prerecorded promotional clips of their songs \"[[Two of Us (song)|Two of Us]]\" and \"[[Let It Be (Beatles song)|Let It Be]],\" broadcast on the show on the first day of March in 1970. The scheduling was, in all probability, in preparation for the release of the band's film ''[[Let It Be (1970 film)|Let It Be]]'' in May of that year.\n\nAlthough the appearances by the Beatles, Elvis and The Supremes are considered the most famous rock and roll performances on ''Ed Sullivan'', several months before Elvis debuted, Sullivan invited [[Bill Haley & His Comets]] to perform their then-current hit \"[[Rock Around the Clock]]\" in early August 1955. This was later recognized by CBS and others (including music historian [[Jim Dawson]] in his book on \"Rock Around the Clock\") as the first performance of a rock and roll song on a national television program.\n\n===African-American artists===\n\n====The Supremes====\n[[File:1966 The Supremes.JPG|thumb|right|[[The Supremes]] singing \"[[My World Is Empty Without You]]\". L-R [[Florence Ballard]], [[Mary Wilson (singer)|Mary Wilson]] and [[Diana Ross]] (Feb. 20, 1966)]]\n[[The Supremes]] were a special act for ''The Ed Sullivan Show''. In addition to 14 appearances,<ref>{{cite news| work=The Velvet Light Trap | title=From Elegance to Extravaganza: The Supremes on The Ed Sullivan Show as a Presentation of Beauty | first=Jaap | last=Kooijman | year=2002 }}</ref> they were a personal favorite of Sullivan, whom he affectionately called \"The Girls\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.edsullivan.com/artists/the-supremes |title=Products Page &#124; Ed Sullivan Show |website=Edsullivan.com |date= |accessdate=2016-10-28}}</ref> Over the five years they performed on the program, the [[Supremes]] performed 15 of their hit singles, and numerous [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] showtunes and other non-Motown songs. The group featuring the most popular lineup of [[Diana Ross]], [[Mary Wilson (singer)|Mary Wilson]], and [[Florence Ballard]] appeared 15 times from December 1964 through May 1967.\n\nThe group reappeared on the series in October 1967 as the newly rebilled \"Diana Ross & the Supremes\", with Ballard replacement [[Cindy Birdsong]] and Ross more prominently featured. The Supremes' final appearance on the show, shortly before it ended, served as the platform to introduce America to Ross's replacement, [[Jean Terrell]], in March 1970.\n\n====Opportunity====\nIn an era when few opportunities existed for [[African American]] performers on national television, Sullivan was a champion of black talent. He launched the careers of many performers by presenting them to a nationwide TV audience and ignored the criticism. In an [[Newspaper Enterprise Association|NEA]] interview, Sullivan commented:\n\n{{cquote|The most important thing [during the first ten years of the program] is that we've put on everything but [[bigotry]]. When the show first started in '48, I had a meeting with the sponsors. There were some [[Southern United States|Southern]] dealers present and they asked if I intended to put on Negroes.<ref>\"Negroes\" was the commonly accepted reference to African Americans at the time.</ref> I said yes. They said I shouldn't, but I convinced them I wasn't going to change my mind. And you know something?  We've gone over very well in the South. Never had a bit of trouble.}}\n\nThe show included entertainers such as [[Frankie Lymon]], [[The Supremes]], [[Marian Anderson]], [[Louis Armstrong]], [[Pearl Bailey]], [[LaVern Baker]], [[Harry Belafonte]], [[Brook Benton]], [[James Brown]] (and [[The Famous Flames]]),<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQg5nT2coys | title=JAMES BROWN \"Please Please Please\" on The Ed Sullivan Show | publisher=YouTube.com | date=October 30, 1966}}</ref> [[Cab Calloway]], [[Godfrey Cambridge]], [[Diahann Carroll]], [[Ray Charles]], [[Nat King Cole]], [[Bill Cosby]], [[Count Basie]], [[Dick Dale]], [[Dorothy Dandridge]], [[Sammy Davis, Jr.]], [[Bo Diddley]], [[Duke Ellington]], [[Lola Falana]], [[The 5th Dimension]], [[Ella Fitzgerald]], The [[Four Tops]], [[Dick Gregory]], [[W.

One telecast included African-American bass-baritone [[Andrew Frierson]] singing \"[[Ol' Man River]]\" from [[Jerome Kern|Kern]] and [[Oscar Hammerstein II|Hammerstein]]'s ''[[Show Boat]]'', a song that, at that time, was usually sung on television by white singers, although it was written for a black character in the musical.\n\nHowever, Sullivan featured \"rockers\", and gave prominence to black musicians \"not without censorship\". For instance, he scheduled [[Fats Domino]] \"at the show's end in case he had to cancel a guest\".  He presented Domino alone at his piano singing as if he were a young [[Nat King Cole|Nat 'King' Cole]] or [[Fats Waller]], as he performed \"Blueberry Hill\".<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKQZy2PJtq8 | title=1956 Fats Domino - Blueberry Hill - Sullivan Show | publisher=YouTube.com}}</ref><ref>Rick Coleman, ''Blue Monday: Fats Domino and the Lost Dawn of Rock 'n' Roll'' (2007), p. 138.</ref> On March 4, 1962, Sullivan presented Domino and his band, who did \"[[Jambalaya (On the Bayou)|Jambalaya]]\", Hank Williams' \"[[You Win Again (Hank Williams song)|You Win Again]]\", and \"Let the Four Winds Blow\".

The characters made a total of 25 appearances.\n\nHenson's Muppets were introduced on ''The Ed Sullivan Show'' on September 18, 1966. Sullivan introduced the characters as \"Jim, uh&nbsp;... Newsom's puppets.\" The act featured a small ball of fur growing into the Rock and Roll Monster (performed by [[Jim Henson]], [[Jerry Nelson]], and [[Frank Oz]]) with three heads and six arms lip-syncing to the unreleased song \"Rock It to Me\" by The Bruthers. After the act was done, the Rock and Roll Monster shrunk back into the ball of fur which is then eaten by Sour Bird (who was previously used in a commercial for [[RC Cola|Royal Crown Cola]]).\n\nOver the next few years, Henson's Muppets would make more appearances, with performances including:\n\n* '''The Art of Visual Thinking''' (October 2, 1966) \u2013 A remake of the skit of the same name from ''[[Sam and Friends]]''. [[Kermit the Frog|Kermit]] (performed by [[Jim Henson]]) teaches Grump (performed by [[Frank Oz]] and voiced by [[Jerry Juhl]]) about the concept of visualizing thoughts through drawings shown on the TV screen. This sketch was reprised on June 4, 1967.\n* '''Monster Family''' (October 23, 1966) \u2013 Fred (performed by [[Jim Henson]]) appears as a father monster talks to his son (performed by [[Jerry Juhl]]) about being a monster. A blue version of Splurge (performed by [[Frank Oz]]) appears as the mother.\n* '''Java''' (November 27, 1966) \u2013 Two tube-like Muppets (which were designed by [[Frank Oz]]) dance to the [[Al Hirt]] song \"Java.\" [[Jim Henson]] and [[Frank Oz]] performed the two puppets and the explosion that provides the punchline was achieved by [[Jerry Juhl]] shooting off a [[fire extinguisher]]. As the three of them prepared to go onstage that night right before Ed Sullivan introduced them, Jerry Juhl suddenly realized that he left the fire extinguisher in their dressing room which was up on the second floor. Jerry Juhl raced to the elevator hearing the \"Java\" music through the speakers in the elevator so he knew exactly how much time he had left until it was too late. Jerry Juhl managed to grab the fire extinguisher, run back to the elevator, and make the trip back down to the stage just in time for the climax. This sketch was reprised on May 26, 1968. The act even was done on ''Stuffed and Unstrung'' (an evolved counterpart of ''[[Puppet Up!]]'').\n* '''Inchworm''' (November 27, 1966) \u2013 Kermit sits on a wall and hums \"Glow Worm\". Kermit also eats some worms that interrupt him. When it comes to the last one, Kermit grabs it and pulls it, showing how long it is, until it turns out that it happens to be the nose of Big V who ends up eating Kermit.\n* '''Music Hath Charms''' (January 15, 1967) \u2013 Kermit plays the piano with some Muppet Monsters dancing to the music. After the song, the piano comes to life and eats Kermit.\n* '''[[I've Grown Accustomed to Her Face|I've Grown Accustomed to Your Face]]''' (February 5, 1967) \u2013 Kermit and Yorick from ''[[Sam and Friends]]'' are featured in this act. Kermit (dressed as a girl) lip-synchs to [[Rosemary Clooney]]'s cover version as Yorick eats his way out of the handkerchief he is under and then tries to eat Kermit. This was previously done on ''[[The Jack Paar Show]]'' and later reprised on this show April 21, 1968, and reprised on August 29, 2011, at the [[D23 (Disney)|D23]] Expo by [[Leslie Carrara-Rudolph]] (who was operating a rebuilt version of Kermit's pre-frog form) and [[Brian Henson]] (who was operating a rebuilt and redesigned version of Yorick). The act was even done on ''Stuffed and Unstrung'' (an evolved counterpart of ''[[Puppet Up!]]''). Clooney's cover was used for that event.\n* '''I Feel Pretty''' (April 30, 1967) \u2013 The story of an ugly girl named Amanda (performed by [[Jim Henson]]) who tries to become beautiful and tries to change her looks using a self-help book in order to gain the affection of Conrad Love (also performed by [[Jim Henson]]). Mert from the ''[[La Choy]]'' commercials and Fred from the ''Kern's Bakery'' commercials appear as Amanda's friends where they were performed by [[Jim Henson]] and [[Jerry Juhl]] (who also voices the narrator) while [[Frank Oz]] does the puppeteering.\n* '''Monster Eats Machine''' (October 8, 1967) \u2013 A prototype version of [[Cookie Monster]] (performed by [[Jim Henson]]) finds a talking machine (voiced by [[Jim Henson]]) and eats it while it explains its various parts. After the monster is done eating the machine, its voice is heard from within the monster as it states that nothing can stop it from performing its function, which is to be the most powerful exploding device known to man. On a related note with this sketch, the prototype version of Cookie Monster was previously used as the Wheel-Stealer from the commercial for ''Wheels, Crowns, and Flutes''. The sketch later appeared on ''[[The Muppet Show]]'' where the Luncheon Counter Monster also ate a machine explaining its functions.\n* '''Rowlf and Jimmy Dean''' (October 8, 1967) \u2013 [[Jimmy Dean]] and [[Rowlf the Dog]] appear together for the last time and perform \"Friendship\" while doing the \"herd of cows\" gag.\n* '''Santa Claus Routine with Arthur Godfrey''' (December 24, 1967) \u2013 [[Arthur Godfrey]] plays [[Santa Claus]] and gets a visit from a group of monsters consisting of Thudge (performed by [[Jim Henson]]), Gleep (a prototype of [[Grover (Sesame Street)|Grover]] performed by [[Frank Oz]]), Scudge (performed by [[Jerry Juhl]]), Snerk and Snork (performed by [[Frank Oz]]). They attempt to steal the toys only to learn that Santa Claus has given them the toys. They then sing \"It's Christmas Tomorrow\".\n* '''Business, Business''' (February 18, 1968) \u2013 Two mean-looking creatures with tube-like necks scat about business while two friendlier creatures scat about values. The Blue Monster and the Orange Creature were performed by [[Jim Henson]] while the Green Monster and the Purple Creature were performed by [[Jerry Juhl]]. A goof is seen where some hands are shown holding the neck of the creatures.\n* '''The Monster Trash Can Dance''' (October 13, 1968) \u2013 Parts of a monster hide in a trash can as an increasingly suspicious Little Girl Sue wanders by.\n* '''Sclrap Flyapp''' (November 24, 1968) \u2013 A weird-looking creature seen from the neck up randomly blurts out Sclrap Flyapp and uses its nose blast on any creature that does not say \"Sclarp Flyapp\". A goof is seen when the Sclrap Flyapp creature is blasted at the end, an opening between its head and neck revealed the puppeteer's hand. This sketch was reworked into the Hugga Wugga sketch on ''[[The Muppet Show]]''.\n* '''Christmas Reindeer''' (December 22, 1968) \u2013 A bunch of [[reindeer]] want snow to fall on Christmas. Dasher and Donner were performed by [[Jim Henson]], Prancer was performed by [[Frank Oz]], Blitzen was performed by [[Jerry Juhl]], and Dancer was performed by [[Bob Payne]]. All the reindeer were built by [[Don Sahlin]].\n* '''A Change of Face''' (March 30, 1969) \u2013 [[Rex Robbins]] changes the face and personality of the Southern Colonel from the ''[[Southern Bread]]'' commercials. A similar routine was used with the same puppet on ''[[The Muppets on Puppets]]''.\n* '''Happy Girl Meets a Monster''' (May 11, 1969) \u2013 The [[List of Muppets#Additional characters|Beautiful Day Monster]] (performed by [[Jim Henson]]) does all he can to ruin a beautiful day for Little Girl Sue (performed by [[Jim Henson]]). Beautiful Day Monster was first seen here before his appearances on ''[[Sesame Street]]'' and ''[[The Muppet Show]]''.\n\nLater performances by the Muppets include:\n\n* '''[[Mah N\u00e0 Mah N\u00e0]]''' (November 30, 1969) \u2013 Mahna Mahna (performed by [[Jim Henson]]) and the Snowths were featured in this song before it was repeated on ''[[The Muppet Show]]''. A goof is seen when Jim Henson's head and arm are seen when Mahna Mahna backs away from the camera.\n* '''Big Bird's Dance''' (December 14, 1969) \u2013 [[Big Bird]] dances to \"Minuet of the Robots\" by [[Jean-Jacques Perrey]] while bird watchers watch him. Danny Seagren performed Big Bird here, but had no dialogue, even when Sullivan talked to him.\n* '''[[Octopus's Garden]]''' (March 1, 1970) \u2013 An [[octopus]] (performed by [[Frank Oz]]) constantly interrupts the singing of \"Octopus's Garden\" by a diver (performed by [[Jim Henson]]) by giving out a bunch of bad puns until he receives comeuppance from a hungry [[giant clam]] (performed by [[Frank Oz]]).\n* '''[[Come Together]]''' (April 12, 1970) \u2013 A strange Muppet band sings the classic song by the Beatles while a giant blue and green dancing [[cowboy]] slowly falls apart.\n* '''[[What Kind of Fool Am I?]]''' (May 31, 1970) \u2013 Kermit tries to sing the song on the piano while Grover continues to interrupt him. Several older Muppets make cameo appearances in the finale of the sketch.\n* '''The Wild String Quartet''' (January 17, 1971) \u2013 Mahna Mahna (performed by [[Jim Henson]]) fills in for a violinist named Beagleman, but ends up playing the drums instead, much to the dismay of Harrison (performed by [[Richard Hunt (puppeteer)|Richard Hunt]]), Twill (performed by [[Jerry Nelson]]) and Grump (performed by [[Frank Oz]]). Twill's puppet was recycled from Fred from the ''[[Munchos]]'' commercials and later used for Zelda Rose in ''[[The Muppet Show]]''.\n* '''The Glutton''' (February 21, 1971) \u2013 An incredibly fat man called the Glutton (performed by [[Jim Henson]] and assisted by [[Frank Oz]]) kept eating things, before being shrunken by a small purple creature and then eaten by a duplicate of himself. After the sketch was over, the Glutton attempted to swallow Ed Sullivan's hand after giving him a [[handshake]].\n\n===Broadway===\nThe show is also noteworthy for showcasing performances from numerous classic [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] [[musical theatre|musicals]] of the era, often featuring members of the original Broadway casts. These include:\n* ''[[West Side Story (musical)|West Side Story]]'' \u2013 [[Carol Lawrence]] and [[Larry Kert]] singing \"[[Tonight (1956 song)|Tonight]]\"; the members of the Jets gang performing \"[[Cool (Leonard Bernstein song)|Cool]]\".\n* ''[[My Fair Lady]]'' \u2013 [[Julie Andrews]] singing \"[[I Could Have Danced All Night]]\" and \"[[Wouldn't It Be Loverly]]?\"; [[Rex Harrison]] performing \"Why Can't the English?\"; [[Stanley Holloway]] performing \"With a Little Bit of Luck; [[John Michael King]] singing \"On the Street Where You Live\"\n* ''[[Camelot (musical)|Camelot]]'' \u2013 [[Richard Burton]] and Julie Andrews performing an extended scene including the title song and \"What Do the Simple Folk Do?\"; [[Robert Goulet]] singing \"[[If Ever I Would Leave You]]\" and \"C'est Moi\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.edsullivan.com/artists/camelot |title=Products Page &#124; Ed Sullivan Show |website=Edsullivan.com |date=1961-03-19 |accessdate=2016-10-28}}</ref>\n* ''[[Show Boat]]'' (1961 [[New York City Center]] revival) \u2013 Andrew Frierson singing \"[[Ol' Man River]]\", and [[Carol Bruce]], from the 1946 Broadway revival, singing \"[[Bill (Show Boat)|Bill]]\".\n* ''[[Carnival!]]'' \u2013 [[Anna Maria Alberghetti]] singing \"Love Makes the World Go 'Round\".\n* ''[[Bye Bye Birdie (film)|Bye Bye Birdie]]'' \u2013 [[Dick Van Dyke]] singing \"Put On A Happy Face\", [[Chita Rivera]] singing \"Spanish Rose\", [[Paul Lynde]] singing \"Kids\" and \"Hymn for a Sunday Evening (Ed Sullivan)\".\n* ''[[Oliver!]]'' \u2013 [[Georgia Brown (English singer)|Georgia Brown]] singing \"[[As Long as He Needs Me]]\"; [[Davy Jones (actor)|Davy Jones]] singing \"[[Consider Yourself]]\"; Georgia Brown, Davy Jones, [[Alice Playten]], Bruce Prochnik, [[Clive Revill]] and the boys singing \"I'd Do Anything\".

(There are traditionally no Broadway performances on Sunday nights, allowing the actors to perform without impacting the Broadway show.) Many performances have been compiled and released on [[DVD]] as ''The Best of Broadway Musicals\u2014Original Cast Performances from The Ed Sullivan Show''.\n\n==Mental illness program==\nIn that same 1958 NEA interview, Sullivan noted his pride about the role that the show had had in improving the public's understanding of [[mental illness]]. Sullivan considered his May 17, 1953, telecast to be the single most important episode in the show's first decade. During that show, a salute to Broadway director [[Joshua Logan]], the two men were watching in the wings, and Sullivan asked Logan how he thought the show was doing. According to Sullivan, Logan told him that the show was dreadfully becoming \"another one of those and-then-I-wrote shows\"; Sullivan asked him what he should do about it, and Logan volunteered to talk about his experiences in a mental institution.<ref name=\"bigasalloutdoors\">\"[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,807794-3,00.html Big As All Outdoors]\" ''Time'', 17 October 1955.</ref>\n\nSullivan took him up on the offer, and in retrospect believed that several advances in the treatment of mental illness could be attributed to the resulting publicity, including the repeal of a Pennsylvania law about the treatment of the mentally ill and the granting of funds for the construction of new [[psychiatric hospital]]s.\n\n==Film clips==\nOccasionally Sullivan would feature a Hollywood actor introducing a clip from a film in which he or she currently starred. [[Burt Lancaster]] made an appearance in 1962, speaking about [[Robert Stroud]], the character he portrayed in ''[[Birdman of Alcatraz (film)|Birdman of Alcatraz]]'', and introducing a clip from the film. And although Sir [[Laurence Olivier]] personally did not appear on the show, in 1966 Sullivan showed a clip from the Olivier ''[[Othello (1965 British film)|Othello]]'', the film version of which was then currently showing in New York City.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0724753/|title=The Ed Sullivan Show (1948\u20131971) : Episode #19.20 |website=IMDb.com|accessdate=2016-10-28}}</ref>\n\n==Controversies==\n===Bo Diddley===\nOn November 20, 1955, [[African American]] rock 'n' roll singer and guitarist [[Bo Diddley]] appeared on ''The Ed Sullivan Show'', only to infuriate Sullivan (\"I did two songs and he got mad\"). Diddley had been asked to sing [[Tennessee Ernie Ford]]'s hit \"[[Sixteen Tons]]\", which he agreed. But when he appeared on stage, he forgot his cue and instead sang his #1 R&B [[Bo Diddley (song)|hit song that bears his name]]. Diddley later recalls, \"Ed Sullivan says to me in plain words: 'You are the first black boy\u2014quote\u2014that ever double crossed me!' I was ready to ''fight'', because I was a little young dude off the streets of Chicago, an' him callin' me 'black' in them days was as bad as sayin' 'nigger'. My manager says to me 'That's Mr. Sullivan!' I said: 'I don\u2019t give a shit about Mr. Sullivan, [h]e don't talk to me like that!' An' so he told me, he says, 'I'll see that you never work no more in show business. You'll never get another TV show in your life!'\"<ref>See Jake Austen, ''TV A-Go-Go: Rock on TV from American Bandstand to American Idol'' (2005), p.15.</ref> Indeed, Diddley seems to have been banned from further appearances, as \"the guitarist never did appear on ''The Ed Sullivan Show'' again.\"<ref>Austen, p.15.</ref>\n\n===A Short Vision===\nOn May 27, 1956,<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://conelrad.blogspot.com/2011/06/short-vision-ed-sullivans-atomic-show.html|title=CONELRAD Adjacent: A SHORT VISION: Ed Sullivan\u2019s Atomic Show Stopper|last=Geerhart|first=Bill|date=2011-06-26|website=CONELRAD Adjacent|access-date=2018-01-20}}</ref> ''The Ed Sullivan Show'' presented an animated short film entitled ''[[A Short Vision]]''. The short subject showcased an unidentified object that is referred to as ''it'' by the narrator. The object flies over Earth. When it passes, the people are asleep except the leaders and the wise men who look up at the object. As the leaders and wise men look up and predators and prey hide in fear, it produces a mushroom cloud in the sky, killing everyone and everything, vaporizing the people, the animals and Earth. After this happens, there remains only a moth and a flame.  The moth flies to the flame, gets vaporized and the flame dies. Thus, marking the end of humanity.\n\nThe short film is narrated in the style of the Bible. The animation is derived from mostly still images that produce a terrifying and horrifying moving image of the end of humanity.   Just before CBS showed the film, Sullivan assured children that what they would see was an animated fantasy. He told the audience that \"It is grim, but I think we can all stand it to realize that in war there is no winner\".<ref name=\":0\" /> The film gained notoriety from the show; but it also gained controversy because of it, due to the graphic way it depicted the horrors of a nuclear confrontation. Its graphic images also caused controversy. One of the visuals in the film depicted an animated character's eyes imploding and the remains running down its cheeks and then it gets destroyed by the object.\n\nAccording to some sources, including contemporary newspaper reports, Ed Sullivan's telecast of ''A Short Vision'' caused a reaction as significant as [[Orson Welles]]' ''[[The War of the Worlds (radio drama)|The War of the Worlds]]'' radio broadcast 20 years prior.{{cn|date=March 2019}} Because of the popularity of the short film, ''The Ed Sullivan Show'' broadcast it again on June 10 of the same year. Sullivan\u2014who in an interview after the first showing erroneously claimed that he had warned children to not watch it\u2014asked adults to remove children from the room before watching the second, heavily publicized showing.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Buddy Holly and the Crickets===\nOn January 26, 1958, for their second appearance on ''The Ed Sullivan Show'', [[Buddy Holly]] and [[The Crickets]] were scheduled to perform two songs. Sullivan wanted the band to substitute a different song for their record hit \"[[Oh, Boy! (The Crickets song)|Oh, Boy!]]\", which he felt was too raucous. Holly had already told his hometown friends in Texas that he would be singing \"Oh, Boy!\" for them, and told Sullivan as much. During the afternoon the Crickets were summoned to rehearsal at short notice, but only Holly was in their dressing room. When asked where the others were, Holly replied, \"I don't know. No telling.\" Sullivan then turned to Holly and said \"I guess The Crickets are not too excited to be on The Ed Sullivan Show\" to which Holly caustically replied, \"I hope they're damn more excited than I am.\"\n\nSullivan, already bothered by the choice of songs, was now even angrier. He cut the Crickets' act from two songs to one, and when introducing them mispronounced Holly's name, so it came out vaguely as \"Hollered\" or \"Holland.\" In addition, Sullivan saw to it that the microphone for Holly's electric guitar was turned off. Holly tried to compensate by singing as loudly as he could, and repeatedly trying to turn up the volume on his guitar. For the instrumental break he cut loose with a dramatic solo, making clear to the audience that the technical fault was not his. The band was received so well that Sullivan was forced to invite them back for a third appearance. Holly's response was that Sullivan did not have enough money. Film of the performance survives; photographs taken that day show Sullivan looking angry and Holly smirking and perhaps ignoring Sullivan.\n\n===Jackie Mason===\nOn October 18, 1964, [[Jackie Mason]] allegedly gave Sullivan [[the finger]] on air. A tape of the incident shows Mason doing his stand-up comedy act and then looking toward Sullivan, commenting that Sullivan was signaling him. Sullivan was reportedly letting Mason know (by pointing two fingers) that he had only two minutes left, as CBS was about to cut away to show a speech by President [[Lyndon Johnson]]. Mason began working his own fingers into his act and pointed toward Sullivan with his middle finger slightly separated. After Mason left the stage, the camera then cut to a visibly angry Sullivan.\n\nSullivan argued with Mason backstage, then terminated his contract. Mason denied knowingly giving Sullivan the middle finger, and Mason later claimed that he had never even heard of the gesture at that time. In retaliation, to protect the perceived threat to his career, Mason filed a libel suit at the [[New York Supreme Court]], which he won.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0838047/bio |title=Ed Sullivan Biography|website=IMDb.com|accessdate=2016-10-28}}</ref>\n\nSullivan publicly apologized to Mason when he appeared on the show two years later, in 1966. At that time, Mason opened his monologue by saying, \"It's a great thrill and a fantastic opportunity to see me in person again,\" and impersonated Sullivan during his act.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okInxY2Pw6c |title=YouTube |publisher=[[YouTube]] |date= |accessdate=2016-10-28}}</ref>  Mason later appeared on the show five times: April 23, 1967; Feb. 25, 1968; Nov. 24, 1968; Jul. 22, 1969; and Aug. 31, 1969.\n\n===Bob Dylan===\n[[Bob Dylan]] was slated to make his first nationwide television appearance on ''The Ed Sullivan Show'' on May 12, 1963, and intended to perform \"[[Talkin' John Birch Paranoid Blues]]\", a song he wrote lampooning the [[John Birch Society]] and the red-hunting paranoia associated with it.  Although Sullivan reportedly liked the song, during the afternoon rehearsal that day CBS officials told Dylan they had deemed the song unacceptable for broadcast and wanted him to substitute another. \"No; this is what I want to do,\" Dylan responded. \"If I can't play my song, I'd rather not appear on the show.\" He then left the studio, rather than altering the act.\n\n===The Doors===\n[[File:The Doors.jpg|right|thumb|The Doors performing \"Light My Fire\", September 17, 1967.]]\n[[The Doors]] were notorious for their appearance on the show. CBS network censors demanded that lead singer [[Jim Morrison]] change the lyrics to their hit single \"[[Light My Fire]]\" by altering the line, \"Girl, we couldn't get much higher,\" before the band performed the song on-camera on September 17, 1967.  (Since the beginning of the fall 1966 television season, the show had been recorded on color videotape a few hours before its 8:00 pm Eastern Standard Time time slot.  Performers and their managers were told that the show must proceed as if it were being done live, and videotape editing on short notice was impossible.)\n\nMorrison sang the original line, however, and CBS executives were powerless to change it because the nature of videotape editing in 1967 required many hours of labor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.edsullivan.com/artists/the-doors |title=Products Page &#124; Ed Sullivan Show |website=Edsullivan.com |date= |accessdate=2016-10-28}}</ref> The Doors were never invited back to the show. According to [[Ray Manzarek]], the band was told, \"Mr. Sullivan liked you boys. He wanted you on six more times. ... You'll never do the Sullivan show again.\" Morrison replied with glee, \"Hey man, we just ''did'' the Sullivan show.\"<ref>{{cite news| title=When the Doors Went on Sullivan| url=http://archives.cnn.com/2002/SHOWBIZ/TV/10/03/ed.sullivan.sidebar| publisher=CNN| date=October 3, 2002| accessdate=2009-05-22}}</ref>\u2014at the time, an appearance was a hallmark of success.\n\nManzarek has given differing accounts of what happened. He has said that the band only pretended to agree to change the line but also that Morrison was nervous and simply forgot to change the line. The performance and incident were reenacted in Oliver Stone's 1991 biographical film, ''[[The Doors (film)|The Doors]]'', albeit in a more dramatic fashion, with Morrison portrayed as emphasizing the word \"higher\".\n\nSullivan apparently felt the damage had been done and relented on bands using the word \"higher\". The following year, [[Sly & the Family Stone]] sang a medley in which Sly repeated the lyric \"Wanna take you higher!\" many times.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kewego.com/video/iLyROoafteTo.html |title=video Sly The Family Stone \u2013 Ed Sullivan Show (1968) |publisher=Kewego.com |accessdate=2011-09-24 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930222251/http://www.kewego.com/video/iLyROoafteTo.html |archivedate=2011-09-30 }}</ref>\n\n===The Rolling Stones===\nIn contrast, [[the Rolling Stones]] were instructed to change the title of their \"[[Let's Spend the Night Together]]\" single for the band's January 15, 1967, appearance. The band complied, with [[Mick Jagger]] and [[Bill Wyman]] ostentatiously rolling their eyes heavenward whenever they reached the song's one-night-only, clean refrain, \"Let's spend some time together\". [[Mick Jagger]] did not wear a jacket on their first appearance on the show (October 25, 1964) and this annoyed Sullivan.

These include:\n\n* [[Will Jordan]] was best known for his uncanny impersonation of Sullivan as the show's host.\n* Numerous music videos, such as [[Billy Joel]]'s \"Tell Her About It\" (featuring [[Will Jordan]] as Sullivan), [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]]'s \"[[In Bloom]]\", [[Grinspoon]]'s \"Hold On Me\", [[Outkast]]'s \"[[Hey Ya!]]\", the [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]]'s \"[[Dani California]]\" and [[Bring Me The Horizon]]'s \"Drown\" have all parodied the show's visual style.\n* [[Rain: A Tribute to the Beatles]] open their concerts with prerecorded footage of a man doing an intentionally poor Sullivan impression in black and white and then introducing the band, which plays the first part of the show with an exact recreation of the set the Beatles used.\n* ''[[All You Need Is Cash]]'' (1978), a [[mockumentary]] about a fictional group, [[The Rutles]]. The film contains original footage of Sullivan introducing [[The Beatles]] with some audio [[dubbing (filmmaking)|redubbed]] for comedic effect.\n* [[The Fab Four (tribute)|The Fab Four]], a [[The Beatles|Beatles]] [[tribute act]] hosted by an Ed Sullivan impressionist.\n* One of the characters in ''[[Lancelot Link, Secret Chimp]]'', a children's [[live action]] TV series with a cast of [[Common chimpanzee|chimpanzee]]s [[dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbed]] by actors' speaking voices, is \"Ed Simian\", a parody of Sullivan.\n* [[Comedian]] [[George Carlin]] included a routine titled ''Ed Sullivan Self Taught'' on his 1972 album ''[[FM & AM]].''\n* [[John Byner]], actor and impressionist, included a Sullivan imitation in his repertoire.\n* On an episode of ''[[The Colgate Comedy Hour]]'', [[Dean Martin]] and [[Jerry Lewis]] did a parody called ''The Toast of the Colgate Town'', with Lewis wearing fake teeth and slicked-back hair as \"Ed Solomon\".<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20010303031635/http://www.roctober.com/roctober/greatness/martinlewis.html ]</ref>\n* In the episode \"Harry Canary\" in the animated series ''[[Dumb and Dumber (TV series)|Dumb and Dumber]]'', it was named \"The Earvin Mulligan Show\" as Lloyd's family were performing in the late 60s as \"The Happy Dunne Family\".\n* The first episode of the ''[[Late Show with David Letterman]]'' on August 30, 1993, featured clips of Ed Sullivan spliced together to make it look as though he was introducing host [[David Letterman]], while a segment later in the episode featured David channeling the \"ghost\" of Ed Sullivan, this time an archive clip of Sullivan introducing actor [[Paul Newman]], who was live in the Letterman audience that night. Since moving to CBS from [[NBC]], Letterman taped his show in the [[Ed Sullivan Theater]], the studio where Sullivan also staged his program, until his 2015 retirement.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kYSEEBooQQ&feature=PlayList&p=3B83727FD1E4EA33&index=0&playnext=1] YouTube \u2013 First (Late) Show \u2013 Part 1 of 9</ref>\n* The [[Tom Hanks]]\u2013directed film ''[[That Thing You Do!]]'' has the Beatles-esque band The Wonders performing in ''The Hollywood Television Showcase'', complete with a caption over the band's lead singer similar to Lennon's \"Sorry Girls! He's Married!\" The scene was shot at [[CBS Television City]] in Los Angeles, which Sullivan used for his West Coast shows.\n* The 1954 film ''[[White Christmas (film)#Plot|White Christmas]]'' features a pivotal scene that occurs on \"The Ed Harrison Show\", which was intentionally similar to Sullivan's show.\n* The 1960s animated television series ''[[The Flintstones]]'' featured a parody of Sullivan as \"Ed Sulleystone\" on the episode \"Itsy Fred.\"  On the episode called \"Lola Brickada,\"  Sullivan was referred to as \"Ed Stonevan.\"  Sullivan is also seen introducing \"Roc Roll\" in another episode, but his name is not mentioned.  And in the episode where Fred brings home a lion cub, Barney performs a trick with the now grown up lion and mentioned that he saw a similar stunt on the \"Ed Shalevan\" show.\n* [[Gabe Kaplan]] did a comedy skit in the 1970s (also featured on his 1974 album ''Holes and Mellow Rolls'' as \"Ed Sullivan, Ed Sullivan\"), that had him impersonate a drunken Sullivan on his final show, being nasty in general to his audience and guest stars, and finally saying good night to the audience.\n* The 1994 film ''[[Pulp Fiction]]'' features a scene in a 50s\u201360s-themed restaurant where Jerome Patrick Hoban does an imitation of Ed Sullivan introducing acts.\n* The direct-to-video children's film ''[[The Wiggles]]: You Make Me Feel Like Dancing!'' includes a video for the song \"Shimmy Shake\" which depicts the group appearing on ''The Ed Sullivan Show''. [[Paul Paddick]] portrayed Sullivan for the video.\n* In the manga series ''[[One Piece]]'', an omake was drawn in which the Straw Hat Pirates, along with other prominent characters, are all tied into one large fiasco that ends with a party. It is called ''The Ed Sullivan Show'' only in name.\n* The Broadway musical ''[[Jersey Boys]]'' features a scene where [[The Four Seasons (band)|Four Seasons]] band member [[Tommy DeVito (musician)|Tommy DeVito]] imitates Sullivan introducing \"Topo Gigio and the Vienna Boys Choir\" before bringing [[Frankie Valli]] on stage for the first time.\n* The [[Ramones]] used a segment of Ed Sullivan shaking [[Buddy Holly]]'s hand on ''The Ed Sullivan Show'' for their music video for \"[[Do You Remember Rock 'n' Roll Radio?]]\"\n* On ''[[South Park]]'', in the episode \"[[Terrance and Phillip: Behind the Blow]]\", black and white footage is shown of Terrance and Philip appearing on the show as children.\n* On the animated sitcom ''[[The Jetsons]]'', \"Fred Solarvan\" introduces [[Gina Lollobrigida|Gina Lola Jupiter]], causing George Jetson to order his son Elroy to leave the room and do his geometry homework tapes. After Elroy leaves, George sets his receiver to [[3D television|3-D viewing]], causing Gina to seemingly to pop out of the TV set.\n* On ''The Tonight Show'', [[Johnny Carson]] would sometimes invoke a Sullivan impression, quoting Sullivan's oft-used introduction \"Right here on our stage...\"\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Bibliography==\n* [[Joe Garner (author)|Garner, Joe]] (2002).

Virtually every type of entertainment appeared on the show; classical musicians, [[opera]] singers, popular recording artists, songwriters, comedians, [[ballet]] dancers, dramatic actors performing [[monologues]] from plays, and [[Circus (performing art)|circus]] acts were regularly featured.

For many years, ''Ed Sullivan'' was a national event each Sunday evening, and was the first exposure for foreign performers to the American public.\nOn the occasion of the show's tenth anniversary telecast, Sullivan commented on how the show had changed during a June 1958 interview syndicated by the [[Newspaper Enterprise Association]] (NEA):\n{{quote|The chief difference is mostly one of pace. In those days, we had maybe six acts. Now we have 11 or 12. Then, each of our acts would do a leisurely ten minutes or so. Now they do two or three minutes. And in those early days I talked too much. Watching these [[kinescope|kines]] I cringe. I look up at me talking away and I say \"You fool!  Keep quiet!\"  But I just keep on talking. I've learned how to keep my mouth shut.}}\n\nThe show enjoyed phenomenal popularity in the 1950s and early 1960s. As had occurred with the annual telecasts of ''[[The Wizard of Oz on television|The Wizard of Oz]]'' in the 1960s and '70s, the family ritual of gathering around the television set to watch Ed Sullivan became almost a U.S. cultural universal. He was regarded as a kingmaker, and performers considered an appearance on his program as a guarantee of stardom, although this sometimes did not turn out to be the case. The show's iconic status is illustrated by the song \"Hymn for a Sunday Evening\" from the 1960 musical ''[[Bye Bye Birdie (musical)|Bye Bye Birdie]]''.  In the song, a family of viewers expresses their regard for the program in worshipful tones.\n\nIn September 1965, CBS started televising the program in [[compatible color]], as all three major networks began to switch to 100 percent color prime time schedules. CBS had once backed its own color system, developed by [[Peter Carl Goldmark|Peter Goldmark]], and resisted using RCA's compatible process until 1954. At that time, it built its first New York City color TV studio, Studio 72, in a former [[RKO Pictures|RKO]] movie theater at 2248 Broadway (81st Street).  One ''Ed Sullivan Show'' was broadcast on August 22, 1954, from the new studio, but it was mostly used for one-time-only specials such as [[Rodgers and Hammerstein]]'s March 31, 1957 ''[[Cinderella (Rodgers and Hammerstein musical)|Cinderella]]''. (The facility was later acquired by TeleTape Productions and notably became the first studio where the PBS children's program ''[[Sesame Street]]'' was produced.) CBS Studio 72 was demolished in 1986 and replaced by an apartment house. CBS Studio 50 was finally \"colorized\" in 1965.  The 1965\u201366 season premiere starred the Beatles in an episode airing on September 12, which was the last episode to air in black and white.  This occurred because the episode was taped at the Beatles' convenience on August 14, the eve of their Shea Stadium performance and a two-week tour of North America,  slightly before the program was ready for color transmission.\n\nIn the late 1960s, Sullivan remarked that his program was waning as the decade went on. He realized that to keep viewers, the best and brightest in entertainment had to be seen, or else the viewers were going to keep on changing the channel. Along with declining viewership, ''Ed Sullivan'' attracted a higher median age for the average viewer (which most sponsors found undesirable) as the seasons went on. These two factors were the reason the show was cancelled by CBS on March 16, 1971 as part of a [[rural purge|mass cancellation of advertiser-averse programming]].  While Sullivan's landmark program ended without a proper finale, Sullivan would produce one-off specials for [[CBS]] until his death in 1974, including an ''Ed Sullivan Show'' 25th anniversary special in 1973.\n\nIn 1990, television documentary producer [[Andrew Solt]] formed SOFA Entertainment, Inc. and purchased the exclusive rights to the complete library of ''The Ed Sullivan Show'' from [[Ed Sullivan]]'s daughter Elizabeth and her husband Bob Precht.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/Entertainment_News/TV/2011/07/20/Comic-icons-pay-tribute-to-Ed-Sullivan/UPI-20741311209902/ |title=Comic Icons Pay Tribute to The Ed Sullivan Show |publisher=[[United Press International]] |date= |accessdate=2011-07-20}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/03/12/technology/12video.html?_r=3& |title=Who Owns the Live Music of Days Gone By? |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=2007-03-12 }}</ref>  The collection consists of 1,087 hours of [[kinescopes]] and videotapes broadcast by CBS on Sunday nights from 1948 to 1971.\n \nSince acquiring the rights to ''The Ed Sullivan Show'' library, SOFA Entertainment has catalogued, organized and cleared performance rights for the original shows.

NBC's was conducted by [[Arturo Toscanini]] and CBS's by [[Alfredo Antonini]]. ''The Ed Sullivan Show''  (originally presented as: ''The Toast Of The Town'') was basically a musical variety show, and thus members of the CBS orchestra were folded into the Ed Sullivan Show Orchestra, conducted by Ray Bloch. During the early days of television, the demands on studio musicians were many-tiered. They needed to be proficient in all genres of music, from classical, to jazz and to rock and roll. ''The Ed Sullivan Show'' would regularly feature singers from the Metropolitan Opera and the staff orchestra would accompany divas such as [[Eileen Farrell]], [[Maria Callas]] or [[Joan Sutherland]]. The musicians needed to be prepared to switch gears for [[Ella Fitzgerald]], [[Diahann Carroll]] or [[Sammy Davis Jr.|Sammy Davis, Jr]]. and then onto [[The Jackson 5ive (TV series)|The Jackson Five]], [[Stevie Wonder]] or [[Tom Jones (singer)|Tom Jones]] or [[Itzhak Perlman]]. They also needed to perform with some of the greatest dancers and ballerinas of the time, from [[Gregory Hines]], [[Juliet Prowse]], [[Maria Tallchief]] <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/obituaries/maria-tallchief-ballet-star-who-was-inspiration-for-balanchine-dies-at-88/2013/04/12/5888f3de-c5dc-11df-94e1-c5afa35a9e59_story.html|title=Maria Tallchief, ballet star who was inspiration for Balanchine, dies at 88|first=Sarah|last=Halzack|date=12 April 2013|publisher=|via=www.washingtonpost.com}}</ref> or [[Margot Fonteyn|Margo Fonteyn]] to the [[Peter Gennaro]] dancers.\nIn the process, the musicians collaborated with several internationally recognized ballet troupes including: [[Ruth Page (ballerina)|Ruth Page]]'s [[Chicago Ballet|Chicago Opera Ballet]], the [[London Festival Ballet]], [[Roland Petit]]'s Ballets de Paris and Russia's [[Igor Moiseyev]] Ballet.<ref>[https://archive.org/details/televisionperfor00rose/page/42 ''Television and the Performing Arts - A Handbook and Reference Guide to American Cultural Programming'' Greenwood Press, New York, 1986, p. 35 Rose, Brian Jeffrey.  The Ed Sullivan Show, Ruth Page Chicago opera Baller, Roland Petit's Ballet and Igor Moiseyev Ballet  on books.google.com] {{ISBN|0-313-24159-7}}</ref>  Few musicians are capable of crossing over from one genre to another. However, each member of the Ed Sullivan Show Orchestra was a specialist and more than capable of covering the complete spectrum of music.\n\n'''<u>The lead trumpet player</u>''' is the \u201cconcert master\u201d of a studio orchestra. [[Chris Griffin (musician)|Chris Griffin]] (formerly with the trumpet section of [[Harry James]], [[Ziggy Elman]] and the [[Benny Goodman]] Band) was [[Ray Bloch]]'s lead trumpet player for the many radio and television shows that he conducted, including the ''Ed Sullivan Show''. \"Chris\" remained the lead trumpet player with ''The Ed Sullivan show'' from the first show in 1948 to the last show in 1971. The '''Trumpet Section''' was composed of: Chris Griffin; Bernie Privin; Jimmy Nottingham and Thad Jones. Chris' son Paul Griffin was a regular substitute trumpeter. '''Trombones''': Roland Dupont; Morton Bullman; Frank Rehak and Cliff Heather. '''Saxes''': Toots Mondello; Hymie Schertzer; etc. '''Piano''': Hank Jones. '''Drums''': Specs Powell/Howard Smith. '''Percussion''': Milton Schlesinger who similarly played from the first to last show. [[John Serry Sr.]] often augmented the orchestra as the lead accordionist during the 1950s. Unlike NBC's ''[[The Tonight Show]]'', which celebrated the notoriety of their musicians in [[Skitch Henderson]]'s or [[Doc Severinsen]]'s \"Tonight Show Band\", the CBS producers of ''The Ed Sullivan Show'' decided to hide their famed musicians behind a curtain. Occasionally, CBS would broadcast specials and call upon the orchestra to perform. When [[Robert Kennedy]] was assassinated, music was hastily composed for the orchestra in a special tribute that also featured [[Bill Evans]], who had recently composed an Elegy To His Father. In 1971, ''The Ed Sullivan Show'' came to an abrupt end. The CBS board of directors chose this occasion to terminate any and all contracts with their musicians as they were unceremoniously shown the door.\n\n==Famous performances/notable guest stars==\n[[File:Beatles with Ed Sullivan.jpg|thumb|Sullivan and The Beatles, February 1964]]\n''The Ed Sullivan Show'' is especially known to the World War II and [[baby boomer]] generations for introducing acts and airing breakthrough performances by popular 1950s and 1960s musicians such as [[Elvis Presley]], [[The Beatles]], [[The Supremes]], [[The Dave Clark Five]], [[The Animals]], [[Creedence Clearwater Revival]], [[The Beach Boys]], [[The Jackson 5]], [[Stevie Wonder]], [[Janis Joplin]], [[The Rolling Stones]], [[The Mamas and the Papas]], [[The Lovin' Spoonful]], [[Herman's Hermits]], [[The Doors]], [[Barbra Streisand]] and [[The Band]]. The Canadian comedy duo [[Wayne and Shuster]] appeared on the program 67 times, a record for any performer.<ref>[http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/wayne-and-shuster/ \"Wayne and Shuster\" ] ''The Canadian Encyclopedia''.  Charles Dougall, 02/07/2006</ref>\n\n===Itzhak Perlman===\nThe American public's first exposure to [[Itzhak Perlman]] was on the show in 1958, when he was 13.  This performance was a breakthrough not only for classical music, but also for Perlman, who rode the waves of admiration that came with performing on the show to new heights of fame and has remained one of the most famous violinists for decades.\n\n===Elvis Presley===\n\n====Initial appearance====\nOn September 9, 1956, Presley made his first appearance on ''The Ed Sullivan Show'' (after earlier appearances on shows hosted by the [[Stage Show (TV series)|Dorsey Brothers]], [[Milton Berle]], and [[Steve Allen]]), even though Sullivan had previously vowed never to allow Presley on the show.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.edsullivan.com/artists/elvis-presley |title=Products Page &#124; Ed Sullivan Show |website=Edsullivan.com |date= |accessdate=2016-10-28}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Sullivan biographer Michael David Harris, \"Sullivan signed Presley when the host was having an intense Sunday-night rivalry with Steve Allen. Allen had the singer on July 1 and trounced Sullivan in the ratings. When asked to comment, [Sullivan] said that he wouldn't consider presenting Presley before a family audience. Less than two weeks later he changed his mind and signed a contract. The newspapers asked him to explain his reversal. 'What I said then was off the reports I'd heard. I hadn't even seen the guy. Seeing the kinescopes, I don't know what the fuss was all about. For instance, the business about rubbing the thighs. He rubbed one hand on his hip to dry off the perspiration from playing his guitar.' \"<ref name=Harris116>{{cite book |title=Always on Sunday: Ed Sullivan, An Inside View |url=https://archive.org/details/alwaysonsundayed00harr |url-access=registration |last=Harris |first=Michael David |year=1968 |publisher=Meredith Press|location=New York |page=[https://archive.org/details/alwaysonsundayed00harr/page/116 116]}}</ref>\n\nSullivan's reaction to Presley's performance on ''[[The Milton Berle Show]]'' was, \"I don't know why everybody picked on Presley, I thought the whole show was dirty and vulgar.\"<ref name=\"American Idol 2005. page 16\">''TV A-Go-Go: Rock on TV from American Bandstand to American Idol''. Jake Austen. 2005. Chicago Review Press, Inc. {{ISBN|1-55652-572-9}}. page 16</ref>\n\nElvis mythology states that Sullivan censored Presley by only shooting him from the waist up. Sullivan may have helped create the myth when he told ''TV Guide'', \"as for his gyrations, the whole thing can be controlled with camera shots.\" In truth Presley's whole body was shown in the first and second shows.<ref name=\"American Idol 2005. page 16\"/>\n\nAt the time, Presley was filming ''[[Love Me Tender (film)|Love Me Tender]]'', so Sullivan's producer, [[Marlo Lewis]], flew to Los Angeles to supervise the two segments telecast that night from [[CBS Television City]] in Hollywood. Sullivan, however, was not able to host his show in New York City because he was recovering from a near fatal automobile accident. [[Charles Laughton]] guest-hosted in Sullivan's place. Laughton appeared in front of plaques with gold records and stated, \"These gold records, four of them... are a tribute to the fact that four of his recordings have sold, each sold, more than a million copies. And this, by the way, is the first time in record-making history that a singer has hit such a mark in such a short time. ... And now, away to Hollywood to meet Elvis Presley.\"<ref name=\"Elvis Presley - Ed Sullivan Shows\">{{cite video |people=Paul Mavis (Director) |title=Elvis Presley \u2013 Ed Sullivan Shows |medium=DVD |publisher=Image Entertainment |date=2006}}</ref>\n\nHowever, according to [[Greil Marcus]], Laughton was the main act of that particular telecast of Sullivan's show. \"Presley was the [ostensible] headliner, and a Sullivan headliner normally opened the show, but Sullivan was burying him. Laughton had to make the moment invisible: to act as if nobody was actually waiting for anything. He did it instantly, with complete command, with the sort of television presence that some have and some\u2014Steve Allen, or Ed Sullivan himself\u2014don't.\"<ref name=\"Marcus100606\">{{cite web |title=Official Press Release \u2013 Elvis Presley: The Ed Sullivan Shows |url=http://www.elvis.com.au/presley/dvd/dvd_ed_sullivan_shows_set.shtml |publisher=Elvis Australia |date=October 6, 2006}} References DVD liner notes by [[Greil Marcus]].</ref>\n\nHost Laughton introduced the singer from New York.  Once on camera, Elvis cleared his throat and said, \"Thank you, Mr. Laughton, ladies and gentlemen. Wow\", and wiped his brow. \"This is probably the greatest honor I've ever had in my life. Ah. There's not much I can say except, it really makes you feel good. We want to thank you from the bottom of our heart. And now ...\" \"[[Don't Be Cruel]]\", which was, after a short introduction by Elvis, followed by \"[[Love Me Tender (song)|Love Me Tender]]\".<ref name=\"Elvis Presley - Ed Sullivan Shows\"/> According to [[Elaine Dundy]], Presley sang \"Love Me Tender\" \"straight, subdued and tender ... \u2014a very different Elvis from the one on ''The Steve Allen Show'' three months before\".<ref>Dundy, Elaine, ''Elvis and Gladys'' (University Press of Mississippi, 2004), p. 259.</ref>\n\nWhen the camera returned to Laughton, he stated, \"Well, well, well well well. Ladies and gentlemen, Elvis Presley. And Mr. Presley, if you are watching this in Hollywood, and I may address myself to you. It has been many a year since any young performer has captured such a wide, and, as we heard tonight, devoted audience.\"<ref name=\"Elvis Presley - Ed Sullivan Shows\"/>\n\n[[File:Sullivan Elvis Ready Expression.JPG|thumb|right|Elvis Presley performing \"Ready Teddy\"]]\nElvis's second set in the show consisted of \"Ready Teddy\" and a short on-air comment to Sullivan, \"Ah, Mr. Sullivan. We know that somewhere out there you are looking in, and, ah, all the boys and myself, and everybody out here, are looking forward to seeing you back on television.\" Next, Elvis declared, \"Friends, as a great philosopher once said, 'You ain't nothin' but a [[Hound Dog (song)|Hound Dog]] ...,' \" as he launched into a short (1:07) version of the song.<ref name=\"Elvis Presley - Ed Sullivan Shows\"/>\n\nAccording to Marcus, \"For the first of his two appearances that night, as a performer Elvis had come on dressed in grandma's nightgown and nightcap.\" Concerning the singer's second set in the show, the author adds that there were \"Elvis, Scotty Moore on guitar, Bill Black on stand-up bass, D. J. Fontana on drums, three Jordanaires on their feet, one at a piano. They were shown from behind; the camera pulled all the way back. They went into 'Ready Teddy.' It was [[Little Richard]]'s most thrilling record\", however, \"there was no way Elvis was going to catch him, but he didn\u2019t have to\u2014the song is a wave and he rode it.

Elvis performed \"[[Don't Be Cruel]]\", then \"[[Love Me Tender (song)|Love Me Tender]]\". Sullivan then addressed the audience as he stood beside Elvis, who began shaking his legs, eliciting screams from the audience. By the time Sullivan turned his head, Elvis was standing motionless. After Presley left the stage, Sullivan stated, \"I can\u2019t figure this darn thing out. You know. He just does this [Ed shakes his legs] and everybody yells.\" Elvis appeared a second time in the show and sang \"[[Love Me (Leiber/Stoller song)|Love Me]]\". Later on, he sang a nearly four-minute-long version of \"[[Hound Dog (song)|Hound Dog]]\" and was shown in full the entire song.\n\nFor the third and final appearance on January 6, 1957, Presley performed a medley of \"[[Hound Dog (song)|Hound Dog]]\", \"[[Love Me Tender (song)|Love Me Tender]]\", and \"[[Heartbreak Hotel]]\", followed by a full version of \"[[Don't Be Cruel]]\". For a second set later in the show he did \"Too Much\" and \"[[When My Blue Moon Turns to Gold Again]]\". For his last set he sang \"[[Peace in the Valley]]\". According to Sullivan's co-producer [[Marlo Lewis]], the rumor had it that \"Elvis has been hanging a small soft-drink bottle from his groin underneath his pants, and when he wiggles his leg it looks as though his pecker reaches down to his knee!\"<ref>See Marlo Lewis and Mina Beth Lewis, ''Prime Time'' (1979), p.146.</ref> It was decided to shoot the singer only from the waist while he performed. Although much has been made of the fact that Elvis was shown only from the waist up, except for the short section of \"[[Hound Dog (song)|Hound Dog]]\", all of the songs on this show were ballads. \"Leaving behind the bland clothes he had worn on the first two shows\", Greil Marcus says, Elvis \"stepped out in the outlandish costume of a pasha, if not a harem girl. From the make-up over his eyes, the hair falling in his face, the overwhelmingly sexual cast of his mouth, he was playing [[Rudolph Valentino]] in ''The Sheik'', with all stops out. That he did so in front of the Jordanaires, who this night appeared as the four squarest-looking men on the planet, made the performance even more potent.\"<ref>Marcus, \"Elvis Presley: The Ed Sullivan Shows\".</ref>\n\nSullivan praised Elvis at the end of the show, saying \"This is a real decent, fine boy.

Sullivan was intrigued, telling his entourage it was the same thing as Elvis all over again. He initially offered Beatles manager [[Brian Epstein]] top dollar for a single show but the Beatles manager had a better idea \u2014 he wanted exposure for his clients: the Beatles would instead appear three times on the show, for only a minimal fee, but receive top billing and two spots (opening and closing) on each show.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.edsullivan.com/artists/The-Beatles |title=Products Page &#124; Ed Sullivan Show |website=Edsullivan.com |date= |accessdate=2016-10-28}}</ref>\n\nThe Beatles appeared on three consecutive Sundays in February 1964 to great anticipation and fanfare as \"[[I Want to Hold Your Hand]]\" had swiftly risen to No. 1 in the charts. Their first appearance on February 9 is considered also along with the appearance of Elvis Presley a few years earlier on that show a milestone in American pop culture and furthermore the beginning of the [[British Invasion]] in music. The broadcast drew an estimated 73 million viewers, at the time a record for US television which would not be broken until three years later by the series finale of ''[[The Fugitive (TV series)|The Fugitive]]''. The Beatles followed Ed's show opening intro, performing \"[[All My Loving]].\" \"[[Till There Was You]],\" which featured the names of the group members superimposed on closeup shots, including the famous \"''SORRY GIRLS, HE'S MARRIED''\" caption on [[John Lennon]]; and \"[[She Loves You]].\" The act that followed Beatles in the broadcast, magician [[Fred Kaps]], was pre-recorded in order to allow time for an elaborate set change.<ref>Spizer, Bruce.

The occasion was used by both camps for publicity. On the evening of the television show (February 16) a crush of people nearly prevented the band from making it onstage. A wedge of policemen were needed and the band began playing \"[[She Loves You]]\" only seconds after reaching their instruments. They continued with \"[[This Boy]],\" and \"[[All My Loving]]\" and returned later to close the show with \"[[I Saw Her Standing There]],\" \"[[From Me to You]]\" and \"[[I Want to Hold Your Hand]].\"\n\nThey were shown on tape February 23 (this appearance had been taped earlier in the day on February 9 before their first live appearance). They followed Ed's intro with \"[[Twist and Shout]]\" and \"[[Please Please Me (song)|Please Please Me]]\" and closed the show once again with \"[[I Want to Hold Your Hand]].\"\n\nThe Beatles appeared live for the final time on August 14, 1965. The show was broadcast September 12, 1965, and earned Sullivan a 60-percent share of the nighttime audience for [[List of most-watched television episodes|one of the appearances]]. This time they followed three acts before coming out to perform \"[[I Feel Fine]],\" \"[[I'm Down]],\" and \"[[Act Naturally]]\" and then closed the show with \"[[Ticket to Ride]],\" \"[[Yesterday (Beatles song)|Yesterday]],\" and \"[[Help! (song)|Help!]]\" Although this was their final live appearance on the show, the group would, for several years, provide filmed [[music video|promotional clip]]s of songs to air exclusively on Sullivan's program such as the 1966 and 1967 clips of \"[[Paperback Writer]],\" \"[[Rain (The Beatles song)|Rain]],\" \"[[Penny Lane]],\" \"[[Strawberry Fields Forever]],\" and \"[[Hello, Goodbye]].\" The group's last appearance on Sullivan's program was via prerecorded promotional clips of their songs \"[[Two of Us (song)|Two of Us]]\" and \"[[Let It Be (Beatles song)|Let It Be]],\" broadcast on the show on the first day of March in 1970. The scheduling was, in all probability, in preparation for the release of the band's film ''[[Let It Be (1970 film)|Let It Be]]'' in May of that year.\n\nAlthough the appearances by the Beatles, Elvis and The Supremes are considered the most famous rock and roll performances on ''Ed Sullivan'', several months before Elvis debuted, Sullivan invited [[Bill Haley & His Comets]] to perform their then-current hit \"[[Rock Around the Clock]]\" in early August 1955. This was later recognized by CBS and others (including music historian [[Jim Dawson]] in his book on \"Rock Around the Clock\") as the first performance of a rock and roll song on a national television program.\n\n===African-American artists===\n\n====The Supremes====\n[[File:1966 The Supremes.JPG|thumb|right|[[The Supremes]] singing \"[[My World Is Empty Without You]]\". L-R [[Florence Ballard]], [[Mary Wilson (singer)|Mary Wilson]] and [[Diana Ross]] (Feb. 20, 1966)]]\n[[The Supremes]] were a special act for ''The Ed Sullivan Show''. In addition to 14 appearances,<ref>{{cite news| work=The Velvet Light Trap | title=From Elegance to Extravaganza: The Supremes on The Ed Sullivan Show as a Presentation of Beauty | first=Jaap | last=Kooijman | year=2002 }}</ref> they were a personal favorite of Sullivan, whom he affectionately called \"The Girls\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.edsullivan.com/artists/the-supremes |title=Products Page &#124; Ed Sullivan Show |website=Edsullivan.com |date= |accessdate=2016-10-28}}</ref> Over the five years they performed on the program, the [[Supremes]] performed 15 of their hit singles, and numerous [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] showtunes and other non-Motown songs. The group featuring the most popular lineup of [[Diana Ross]], [[Mary Wilson (singer)|Mary Wilson]], and [[Florence Ballard]] appeared 15 times from December 1964 through May 1967.\n\nThe group reappeared on the series in October 1967 as the newly rebilled \"Diana Ross & the Supremes\", with Ballard replacement [[Cindy Birdsong]] and Ross more prominently featured. The Supremes' final appearance on the show, shortly before it ended, served as the platform to introduce America to Ross's replacement, [[Jean Terrell]], in March 1970.\n\n====Opportunity====\nIn an era when few opportunities existed for [[African American]] performers on national television, Sullivan was a champion of black talent. He launched the careers of many performers by presenting them to a nationwide TV audience and ignored the criticism. In an [[Newspaper Enterprise Association|NEA]] interview, Sullivan commented:\n\n{{cquote|The most important thing [during the first ten years of the program] is that we've put on everything but [[bigotry]]. When the show first started in '48, I had a meeting with the sponsors. There were some [[Southern United States|Southern]] dealers present and they asked if I intended to put on Negroes.<ref>\"Negroes\" was the commonly accepted reference to African Americans at the time.</ref> I said yes. They said I shouldn't, but I convinced them I wasn't going to change my mind. And you know something?  We've gone over very well in the South. Never had a bit of trouble.}}\n\nThe show included entertainers such as [[Frankie Lymon]], [[The Supremes]], [[Marian Anderson]], [[Louis Armstrong]], [[Pearl Bailey]], [[LaVern Baker]], [[Harry Belafonte]], [[Brook Benton]], [[James Brown]] (and [[The Famous Flames]]),<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQg5nT2coys | title=JAMES BROWN \"Please Please Please\" on The Ed Sullivan Show | publisher=YouTube.com | date=October 30, 1966}}</ref> [[Cab Calloway]], [[Godfrey Cambridge]], [[Diahann Carroll]], [[Ray Charles]], [[Nat King Cole]], [[Bill Cosby]], [[Count Basie]], [[Dick Dale]], [[Dorothy Dandridge]], [[Sammy Davis, Jr.]], [[Bo Diddley]], [[Duke Ellington]], [[Lola Falana]], [[The 5th Dimension]], [[Ella Fitzgerald]], The [[Four Tops]], [[Dick Gregory]], [[W.

One telecast included African-American bass-baritone [[Andrew Frierson]] singing \"[[Ol' Man River]]\" from [[Jerome Kern|Kern]] and [[Oscar Hammerstein II|Hammerstein]]'s ''[[Show Boat]]'', a song that, at that time, was usually sung on television by white singers, although it was written for a black character in the musical.\n\nHowever, Sullivan featured \"rockers\", and gave prominence to black musicians \"not without censorship\". For instance, he scheduled [[Fats Domino]] \"at the show's end in case he had to cancel a guest\".  He presented Domino alone at his piano singing as if he were a young [[Nat King Cole|Nat 'King' Cole]] or [[Fats Waller]], as he performed \"Blueberry Hill\".<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bKQZy2PJtq8 | title=1956 Fats Domino - Blueberry Hill - Sullivan Show | publisher=YouTube.com}}</ref><ref>Rick Coleman, ''Blue Monday: Fats Domino and the Lost Dawn of Rock 'n' Roll'' (2007), p. 138.</ref> On March 4, 1962, Sullivan presented Domino and his band, who did \"[[Jambalaya (On the Bayou)|Jambalaya]]\", Hank Williams' \"[[You Win Again (Hank Williams song)|You Win Again]]\", and \"Let the Four Winds Blow\".

The characters made a total of 25 appearances.\n\nHenson's Muppets were introduced on ''The Ed Sullivan Show'' on September 18, 1966. Sullivan introduced the characters as \"Jim, uh&nbsp;... Newsom's puppets.\" The act featured a small ball of fur growing into the Rock and Roll Monster (performed by [[Jim Henson]], [[Jerry Nelson]], and [[Frank Oz]]) with three heads and six arms lip-syncing to the unreleased song \"Rock It to Me\" by The Bruthers. After the act was done, the Rock and Roll Monster shrunk back into the ball of fur which is then eaten by Sour Bird (who was previously used in a commercial for [[RC Cola|Royal Crown Cola]]).\n\nOver the next few years, Henson's Muppets would make more appearances, with performances including:\n\n* '''The Art of Visual Thinking''' (October 2, 1966) \u2013 A remake of the skit of the same name from ''[[Sam and Friends]]''. [[Kermit the Frog|Kermit]] (performed by [[Jim Henson]]) teaches Grump (performed by [[Frank Oz]] and voiced by [[Jerry Juhl]]) about the concept of visualizing thoughts through drawings shown on the TV screen. This sketch was reprised on June 4, 1967.\n* '''Monster Family''' (October 23, 1966) \u2013 Fred (performed by [[Jim Henson]]) appears as a father monster talks to his son (performed by [[Jerry Juhl]]) about being a monster. A blue version of Splurge (performed by [[Frank Oz]]) appears as the mother.\n* '''Java''' (November 27, 1966) \u2013 Two tube-like Muppets (which were designed by [[Frank Oz]]) dance to the [[Al Hirt]] song \"Java.\" [[Jim Henson]] and [[Frank Oz]] performed the two puppets and the explosion that provides the punchline was achieved by [[Jerry Juhl]] shooting off a [[fire extinguisher]]. As the three of them prepared to go onstage that night right before Ed Sullivan introduced them, Jerry Juhl suddenly realized that he left the fire extinguisher in their dressing room which was up on the second floor. Jerry Juhl raced to the elevator hearing the \"Java\" music through the speakers in the elevator so he knew exactly how much time he had left until it was too late. Jerry Juhl managed to grab the fire extinguisher, run back to the elevator, and make the trip back down to the stage just in time for the climax. This sketch was reprised on May 26, 1968. The act even was done on ''Stuffed and Unstrung'' (an evolved counterpart of ''[[Puppet Up!]]'').\n* '''Inchworm''' (November 27, 1966) \u2013 Kermit sits on a wall and hums \"Glow Worm\". Kermit also eats some worms that interrupt him. When it comes to the last one, Kermit grabs it and pulls it, showing how long it is, until it turns out that it happens to be the nose of Big V who ends up eating Kermit.\n* '''Music Hath Charms''' (January 15, 1967) \u2013 Kermit plays the piano with some Muppet Monsters dancing to the music. After the song, the piano comes to life and eats Kermit.\n* '''[[I've Grown Accustomed to Her Face|I've Grown Accustomed to Your Face]]''' (February 5, 1967) \u2013 Kermit and Yorick from ''[[Sam and Friends]]'' are featured in this act. Kermit (dressed as a girl) lip-synchs to [[Rosemary Clooney]]'s cover version as Yorick eats his way out of the handkerchief he is under and then tries to eat Kermit. This was previously done on ''[[The Jack Paar Show]]'' and later reprised on this show April 21, 1968, and reprised on August 29, 2011, at the [[D23 (Disney)|D23]] Expo by [[Leslie Carrara-Rudolph]] (who was operating a rebuilt version of Kermit's pre-frog form) and [[Brian Henson]] (who was operating a rebuilt and redesigned version of Yorick). The act was even done on ''Stuffed and Unstrung'' (an evolved counterpart of ''[[Puppet Up!]]''). Clooney's cover was used for that event.\n* '''I Feel Pretty''' (April 30, 1967) \u2013 The story of an ugly girl named Amanda (performed by [[Jim Henson]]) who tries to become beautiful and tries to change her looks using a self-help book in order to gain the affection of Conrad Love (also performed by [[Jim Henson]]). Mert from the ''[[La Choy]]'' commercials and Fred from the ''Kern's Bakery'' commercials appear as Amanda's friends where they were performed by [[Jim Henson]] and [[Jerry Juhl]] (who also voices the narrator) while [[Frank Oz]] does the puppeteering.\n* '''Monster Eats Machine''' (October 8, 1967) \u2013 A prototype version of [[Cookie Monster]] (performed by [[Jim Henson]]) finds a talking machine (voiced by [[Jim Henson]]) and eats it while it explains its various parts. After the monster is done eating the machine, its voice is heard from within the monster as it states that nothing can stop it from performing its function, which is to be the most powerful exploding device known to man. On a related note with this sketch, the prototype version of Cookie Monster was previously used as the Wheel-Stealer from the commercial for ''Wheels, Crowns, and Flutes''. The sketch later appeared on ''[[The Muppet Show]]'' where the Luncheon Counter Monster also ate a machine explaining its functions.\n* '''Rowlf and Jimmy Dean''' (October 8, 1967) \u2013 [[Jimmy Dean]] and [[Rowlf the Dog]] appear together for the last time and perform \"Friendship\" while doing the \"herd of cows\" gag.\n* '''Santa Claus Routine with Arthur Godfrey''' (December 24, 1967) \u2013 [[Arthur Godfrey]] plays [[Santa Claus]] and gets a visit from a group of monsters consisting of Thudge (performed by [[Jim Henson]]), Gleep (a prototype of [[Grover (Sesame Street)|Grover]] performed by [[Frank Oz]]), Scudge (performed by [[Jerry Juhl]]), Snerk and Snork (performed by [[Frank Oz]]). They attempt to steal the toys only to learn that Santa Claus has given them the toys. They then sing \"It's Christmas Tomorrow\".\n* '''Business, Business''' (February 18, 1968) \u2013 Two mean-looking creatures with tube-like necks scat about business while two friendlier creatures scat about values. The Blue Monster and the Orange Creature were performed by [[Jim Henson]] while the Green Monster and the Purple Creature were performed by [[Jerry Juhl]]. A goof is seen where some hands are shown holding the neck of the creatures.\n* '''The Monster Trash Can Dance''' (October 13, 1968) \u2013 Parts of a monster hide in a trash can as an increasingly suspicious Little Girl Sue wanders by.\n* '''Sclrap Flyapp''' (November 24, 1968) \u2013 A weird-looking creature seen from the neck up randomly blurts out Sclrap Flyapp and uses its nose blast on any creature that does not say \"Sclarp Flyapp\". A goof is seen when the Sclrap Flyapp creature is blasted at the end, an opening between its head and neck revealed the puppeteer's hand. This sketch was reworked into the Hugga Wugga sketch on ''[[The Muppet Show]]''.\n* '''Christmas Reindeer''' (December 22, 1968) \u2013 A bunch of [[reindeer]] want snow to fall on Christmas. Dasher and Donner were performed by [[Jim Henson]], Prancer was performed by [[Frank Oz]], Blitzen was performed by [[Jerry Juhl]], and Dancer was performed by [[Bob Payne]]. All the reindeer were built by [[Don Sahlin]].\n* '''A Change of Face''' (March 30, 1969) \u2013 [[Rex Robbins]] changes the face and personality of the Southern Colonel from the ''[[Southern Bread]]'' commercials. A similar routine was used with the same puppet on ''[[The Muppets on Puppets]]''.\n* '''Happy Girl Meets a Monster''' (May 11, 1969) \u2013 The [[List of Muppets#Additional characters|Beautiful Day Monster]] (performed by [[Jim Henson]]) does all he can to ruin a beautiful day for Little Girl Sue (performed by [[Jim Henson]]). Beautiful Day Monster was first seen here before his appearances on ''[[Sesame Street]]'' and ''[[The Muppet Show]]''.\n\nLater performances by the Muppets include:\n\n* '''[[Mah N\u00e0 Mah N\u00e0]]''' (November 30, 1969) \u2013 Mahna Mahna (performed by [[Jim Henson]]) and the Snowths were featured in this song before it was repeated on ''[[The Muppet Show]]''. A goof is seen when Jim Henson's head and arm are seen when Mahna Mahna backs away from the camera.\n* '''Big Bird's Dance''' (December 14, 1969) \u2013 [[Big Bird]] dances to \"Minuet of the Robots\" by [[Jean-Jacques Perrey]] while bird watchers watch him. Danny Seagren performed Big Bird here, but had no dialogue, even when Sullivan talked to him.\n* '''[[Octopus's Garden]]''' (March 1, 1970) \u2013 An [[octopus]] (performed by [[Frank Oz]]) constantly interrupts the singing of \"Octopus's Garden\" by a diver (performed by [[Jim Henson]]) by giving out a bunch of bad puns until he receives comeuppance from a hungry [[giant clam]] (performed by [[Frank Oz]]).\n* '''[[Come Together]]''' (April 12, 1970) \u2013 A strange Muppet band sings the classic song by the Beatles while a giant blue and green dancing [[cowboy]] slowly falls apart.\n* '''[[What Kind of Fool Am I?]]''' (May 31, 1970) \u2013 Kermit tries to sing the song on the piano while Grover continues to interrupt him. Several older Muppets make cameo appearances in the finale of the sketch.\n* '''The Wild String Quartet''' (January 17, 1971) \u2013 Mahna Mahna (performed by [[Jim Henson]]) fills in for a violinist named Beagleman, but ends up playing the drums instead, much to the dismay of Harrison (performed by [[Richard Hunt (puppeteer)|Richard Hunt]]), Twill (performed by [[Jerry Nelson]]) and Grump (performed by [[Frank Oz]]). Twill's puppet was recycled from Fred from the ''[[Munchos]]'' commercials and later used for Zelda Rose in ''[[The Muppet Show]]''.\n* '''The Glutton''' (February 21, 1971) \u2013 An incredibly fat man called the Glutton (performed by [[Jim Henson]] and assisted by [[Frank Oz]]) kept eating things, before being shrunken by a small purple creature and then eaten by a duplicate of himself. After the sketch was over, the Glutton attempted to swallow Ed Sullivan's hand after giving him a [[handshake]].\n\n===Broadway===\nThe show is also noteworthy for showcasing performances from numerous classic [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] [[musical theatre|musicals]] of the era, often featuring members of the original Broadway casts. These include:\n* ''[[West Side Story (musical)|West Side Story]]'' \u2013 [[Carol Lawrence]] and [[Larry Kert]] singing \"[[Tonight (1956 song)|Tonight]]\"; the members of the Jets gang performing \"[[Cool (Leonard Bernstein song)|Cool]]\".\n* ''[[My Fair Lady]]'' \u2013 [[Julie Andrews]] singing \"[[I Could Have Danced All Night]]\" and \"[[Wouldn't It Be Loverly]]?\"; [[Rex Harrison]] performing \"Why Can't the English?\"; [[Stanley Holloway]] performing \"With a Little Bit of Luck; [[John Michael King]] singing \"On the Street Where You Live\"\n* ''[[Camelot (musical)|Camelot]]'' \u2013 [[Richard Burton]] and Julie Andrews performing an extended scene including the title song and \"What Do the Simple Folk Do?\"; [[Robert Goulet]] singing \"[[If Ever I Would Leave You]]\" and \"C'est Moi\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.edsullivan.com/artists/camelot |title=Products Page &#124; Ed Sullivan Show |website=Edsullivan.com |date=1961-03-19 |accessdate=2016-10-28}}</ref>\n* ''[[Show Boat]]'' (1961 [[New York City Center]] revival) \u2013 Andrew Frierson singing \"[[Ol' Man River]]\", and [[Carol Bruce]], from the 1946 Broadway revival, singing \"[[Bill (Show Boat)|Bill]]\".\n* ''[[Carnival!]]'' \u2013 [[Anna Maria Alberghetti]] singing \"Love Makes the World Go 'Round\".\n* ''[[Bye Bye Birdie (film)|Bye Bye Birdie]]'' \u2013 [[Dick Van Dyke]] singing \"Put On A Happy Face\", [[Chita Rivera]] singing \"Spanish Rose\", [[Paul Lynde]] singing \"Kids\" and \"Hymn for a Sunday Evening (Ed Sullivan)\".\n* ''[[Oliver!]]'' \u2013 [[Georgia Brown (English singer)|Georgia Brown]] singing \"[[As Long as He Needs Me]]\"; [[Davy Jones (actor)|Davy Jones]] singing \"[[Consider Yourself]]\"; Georgia Brown, Davy Jones, [[Alice Playten]], Bruce Prochnik, [[Clive Revill]] and the boys singing \"I'd Do Anything\".

(There are traditionally no Broadway performances on Sunday nights, allowing the actors to perform without impacting the Broadway show.) Many performances have been compiled and released on [[DVD]] as ''The Best of Broadway Musicals\u2014Original Cast Performances from The Ed Sullivan Show''.\n\n==Mental illness program==\nIn that same 1958 NEA interview, Sullivan noted his pride about the role that the show had had in improving the public's understanding of [[mental illness]]. Sullivan considered his May 17, 1953, telecast to be the single most important episode in the show's first decade. During that show, a salute to Broadway director [[Joshua Logan]], the two men were watching in the wings, and Sullivan asked Logan how he thought the show was doing. According to Sullivan, Logan told him that the show was dreadfully becoming \"another one of those and-then-I-wrote shows\"; Sullivan asked him what he should do about it, and Logan volunteered to talk about his experiences in a mental institution.<ref name=\"bigasalloutdoors\">\"[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,807794-3,00.html Big As All Outdoors]\" ''Time'', 17 October 1955.</ref>\n\nSullivan took him up on the offer, and in retrospect believed that several advances in the treatment of mental illness could be attributed to the resulting publicity, including the repeal of a Pennsylvania law about the treatment of the mentally ill and the granting of funds for the construction of new [[psychiatric hospital]]s.\n\n==Film clips==\nOccasionally Sullivan would feature a Hollywood actor introducing a clip from a film in which he or she currently starred. [[Burt Lancaster]] made an appearance in 1962, speaking about [[Robert Stroud]], the character he portrayed in ''[[Birdman of Alcatraz (film)|Birdman of Alcatraz]]'', and introducing a clip from the film. And although Sir [[Laurence Olivier]] personally did not appear on the show, in 1966 Sullivan showed a clip from the Olivier ''[[Othello (1965 British film)|Othello]]'', the film version of which was then currently showing in New York City.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0724753/|title=The Ed Sullivan Show (1948\u20131971) : Episode #19.20 |website=IMDb.com|accessdate=2016-10-28}}</ref>\n\n==Controversies==\n===Bo Diddley===\nOn November 20, 1955, [[African American]] rock 'n' roll singer and guitarist [[Bo Diddley]] appeared on ''The Ed Sullivan Show'', only to infuriate Sullivan (\"I did two songs and he got mad\"). Diddley had been asked to sing [[Tennessee Ernie Ford]]'s hit \"[[Sixteen Tons]]\", which he agreed. But when he appeared on stage, he forgot his cue and instead sang his #1 R&B [[Bo Diddley (song)|hit song that bears his name]]. Diddley later recalls, \"Ed Sullivan says to me in plain words: 'You are the first black boy\u2014quote\u2014that ever double crossed me!' I was ready to ''fight'', because I was a little young dude off the streets of Chicago, an' him callin' me 'black' in them days was as bad as sayin' 'nigger'. My manager says to me 'That's Mr. Sullivan!' I said: 'I don\u2019t give a shit about Mr. Sullivan, [h]e don't talk to me like that!' An' so he told me, he says, 'I'll see that you never work no more in show business. You'll never get another TV show in your life!'\"<ref>See Jake Austen, ''TV A-Go-Go: Rock on TV from American Bandstand to American Idol'' (2005), p.15.</ref> Indeed, Diddley seems to have been banned from further appearances, as \"the guitarist never did appear on ''The Ed Sullivan Show'' again.\"<ref>Austen, p.15.</ref>\n\n===A Short Vision===\nOn May 27, 1956,<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite web|url=http://conelrad.blogspot.com/2011/06/short-vision-ed-sullivans-atomic-show.html|title=CONELRAD Adjacent: A SHORT VISION: Ed Sullivan\u2019s Atomic Show Stopper|last=Geerhart|first=Bill|date=2011-06-26|website=CONELRAD Adjacent|access-date=2018-01-20}}</ref> ''The Ed Sullivan Show'' presented an animated short film entitled ''[[A Short Vision]]''.

As the leaders and wise men look up and predators and prey hide in fear, it produces a mushroom cloud in the sky, killing everyone and everything, vaporizing the people, the animals and Earth. After this happens, there remains only a moth and a flame.  The moth flies to the flame, gets vaporized and the flame dies. Thus, marking the end of humanity.\n\nThe short film is narrated in the style of the Bible. The animation is derived from mostly still images that produce a terrifying and horrifying moving image of the end of humanity.   Just before CBS showed the film, Sullivan assured children that what they would see was an animated fantasy. He told the audience that \"It is grim, but I think we can all stand it to realize that in war there is no winner\".<ref name=\":0\" /> The film gained notoriety from the show; but it also gained controversy because of it, due to the graphic way it depicted the horrors of a nuclear confrontation. Its graphic images also caused controversy. One of the visuals in the film depicted an animated character's eyes imploding and the remains running down its cheeks and then it gets destroyed by the object.\n\nAccording to some sources, including contemporary newspaper reports, Ed Sullivan's telecast of ''A Short Vision'' caused a reaction as significant as [[Orson Welles]]' ''[[The War of the Worlds (radio drama)|The War of the Worlds]]'' radio broadcast 20 years prior.{{cn|date=March 2019}} Because of the popularity of the short film, ''The Ed Sullivan Show'' broadcast it again on June 10 of the same year. Sullivan\u2014who in an interview after the first showing erroneously claimed that he had warned children to not watch it\u2014asked adults to remove children from the room before watching the second, heavily publicized showing.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n===Buddy Holly and the Crickets===\nOn January 26, 1958, for their second appearance on ''The Ed Sullivan Show'', [[Buddy Holly]] and [[The Crickets]] were scheduled to perform two songs. Sullivan wanted the band to substitute a different song for their record hit \"[[Oh, Boy! (The Crickets song)|Oh, Boy!]]\", which he felt was too raucous. Holly had already told his hometown friends in Texas that he would be singing \"Oh, Boy!\" for them, and told Sullivan as much. During the afternoon the Crickets were summoned to rehearsal at short notice, but only Holly was in their dressing room. When asked where the others were, Holly replied, \"I don't know. No telling.\" Sullivan then turned to Holly and said \"I guess The Crickets are not too excited to be on The Ed Sullivan Show\" to which Holly caustically replied, \"I hope they're damn more excited than I am.\"\n\nSullivan, already bothered by the choice of songs, was now even angrier. He cut the Crickets' act from two songs to one, and when introducing them mispronounced Holly's name, so it came out vaguely as \"Hollered\" or \"Holland.\" In addition, Sullivan saw to it that the microphone for Holly's electric guitar was turned off. Holly tried to compensate by singing as loudly as he could, and repeatedly trying to turn up the volume on his guitar. For the instrumental break he cut loose with a dramatic solo, making clear to the audience that the technical fault was not his. The band was received so well that Sullivan was forced to invite them back for a third appearance. Holly's response was that Sullivan did not have enough money. Film of the performance survives; photographs taken that day show Sullivan looking angry and Holly smirking and perhaps ignoring Sullivan.\n\n===Jackie Mason===\nOn October 18, 1964, [[Jackie Mason]] allegedly gave Sullivan [[the finger]] on air. A tape of the incident shows Mason doing his stand-up comedy act and then looking toward Sullivan, commenting that Sullivan was signaling him. Sullivan was reportedly letting Mason know (by pointing two fingers) that he had only two minutes left, as CBS was about to cut away to show a speech by President [[Lyndon Johnson]]. Mason began working his own fingers into his act and pointed toward Sullivan with his middle finger slightly separated. After Mason left the stage, the camera then cut to a visibly angry Sullivan.\n\nSullivan argued with Mason backstage, then terminated his contract. Mason denied knowingly giving Sullivan the middle finger, and Mason later claimed that he had never even heard of the gesture at that time. In retaliation, to protect the perceived threat to his career, Mason filed a libel suit at the [[New York Supreme Court]], which he won.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0838047/bio |title=Ed Sullivan Biography|website=IMDb.com|accessdate=2016-10-28}}</ref>\n\nSullivan publicly apologized to Mason when he appeared on the show two years later, in 1966. At that time, Mason opened his monologue by saying, \"It's a great thrill and a fantastic opportunity to see me in person again,\" and impersonated Sullivan during his act.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=okInxY2Pw6c |title=YouTube |publisher=[[YouTube]] |date= |accessdate=2016-10-28}}</ref>  Mason later appeared on the show five times: April 23, 1967; Feb. 25, 1968; Nov. 24, 1968; Jul. 22, 1969; and Aug. 31, 1969.\n\n===Bob Dylan===\n[[Bob Dylan]] was slated to make his first nationwide television appearance on ''The Ed Sullivan Show'' on May 12, 1963, and intended to perform \"[[Talkin' John Birch Paranoid Blues]]\", a song he wrote lampooning the [[John Birch Society]] and the red-hunting paranoia associated with it.  Although Sullivan reportedly liked the song, during the afternoon rehearsal that day CBS officials told Dylan they had deemed the song unacceptable for broadcast and wanted him to substitute another. \"No; this is what I want to do,\" Dylan responded. \"If I can't play my song, I'd rather not appear on the show.\" He then left the studio, rather than altering the act.\n\n===The Doors===\n[[File:The Doors.jpg|right|thumb|The Doors performing \"Light My Fire\", September 17, 1967.]]\n[[The Doors]] were notorious for their appearance on the show. CBS network censors demanded that lead singer [[Jim Morrison]] change the lyrics to their hit single \"[[Light My Fire]]\" by altering the line, \"Girl, we couldn't get much higher,\" before the band performed the song on-camera on September 17, 1967.  (Since the beginning of the fall 1966 television season, the show had been recorded on color videotape a few hours before its 8:00 pm Eastern Standard Time time slot.  Performers and their managers were told that the show must proceed as if it were being done live, and videotape editing on short notice was impossible.)\n\nMorrison sang the original line, however, and CBS executives were powerless to change it because the nature of videotape editing in 1967 required many hours of labor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.edsullivan.com/artists/the-doors |title=Products Page &#124; Ed Sullivan Show |website=Edsullivan.com |date= |accessdate=2016-10-28}}</ref> The Doors were never invited back to the show. According to [[Ray Manzarek]], the band was told, \"Mr. Sullivan liked you boys. He wanted you on six more times. ... You'll never do the Sullivan show again.\" Morrison replied with glee, \"Hey man, we just ''did'' the Sullivan show.\"<ref>{{cite news| title=When the Doors Went on Sullivan| url=http://archives.cnn.com/2002/SHOWBIZ/TV/10/03/ed.sullivan.sidebar| publisher=CNN| date=October 3, 2002| accessdate=2009-05-22}}</ref>\u2014at the time, an appearance was a hallmark of success.\n\nManzarek has given differing accounts of what happened. He has said that the band only pretended to agree to change the line but also that Morrison was nervous and simply forgot to change the line. The performance and incident were reenacted in Oliver Stone's 1991 biographical film, ''[[The Doors (film)|The Doors]]'', albeit in a more dramatic fashion, with Morrison portrayed as emphasizing the word \"higher\".\n\nSullivan apparently felt the damage had been done and relented on bands using the word \"higher\". The following year, [[Sly & the Family Stone]] sang a medley in which Sly repeated the lyric \"Wanna take you higher!\" many times.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kewego.com/video/iLyROoafteTo.html |title=video Sly The Family Stone \u2013 Ed Sullivan Show (1968) |publisher=Kewego.com |accessdate=2011-09-24 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930222251/http://www.kewego.com/video/iLyROoafteTo.html |archivedate=2011-09-30 }}</ref>\n\n===The Rolling Stones===\nIn contrast, [[the Rolling Stones]] were instructed to change the title of their \"[[Let's Spend the Night Together]]\" single for the band's January 15, 1967, appearance. The band complied, with [[Mick Jagger]] and [[Bill Wyman]] ostentatiously rolling their eyes heavenward whenever they reached the song's one-night-only, clean refrain, \"Let's spend some time together\". [[Mick Jagger]] did not wear a jacket on their first appearance on the show (October 25, 1964) and this annoyed Sullivan.  They were asked to appear again, but they were asked to wear jackets for their 1965 appearance.  The Stones would ultimately play on the ''Ed Sullivan Show'' six times.<ref>Uslan, Michael and Bruce Solomon. ''Dick Clark's The First 25 Years of Rock and Roll.'' New York: Dell, 1981. p. 181</ref>\n\nIn contrast, [[The Supremes|Diana Ross & the Supremes]], frequent guests on Sullivan's show, debuted their then-release and eventually controversial #1 hit song \"[[Love Child (song)|Love Child]]\" on Sullivan's show, but nothing about its title or its content about a woman in poverty having a child out of wedlock (which was taboo to mention on television at the time) seemed to faze Sullivan, the show's producers, or the network.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.edsullivan.com/artists/the-rolling-stones |title=Products Page &#124; Ed Sullivan Show |website=Edsullivan.com |date= |accessdate=2016-10-28}}</ref>\n\n==Ratings history==\n* 1948\u20131949: N/A\n* 1949\u20131950: N/A\n* 1950\u20131951: #15, 3,723,000 viewers<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.classictvhits.com/tvratings/1950.htm |title=TV Ratings: 1950\u20131951 |publisher=ClassicTVHits.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-24}}</ref>\n* 1951\u20131952: N/A\n* 1952\u20131953: N/A\n* 1953\u20131954: #17, 8,580,000 viewers<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.classictvhits.com/tvratings/1953.htm |title=TV Ratings: 1953\u20131954 |publisher=ClassicTVHits.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-24}}</ref>\n* 1954\u20131955: #5, 12,157,200 viewers<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.classictvhits.com/tvratings/1954.htm |title=TV Ratings: 1954\u20131955 |publisher=ClassicTVHits.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-24}}</ref>\n* 1955\u20131956: #3, 13,785,500 viewers<ref>{{cite web|url=http://classictvhits.com/tvratings/1955.htm |title=TV Ratings: 1955\u20131956 |publisher=ClassicTVHits.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-24}}</ref>\n* 1956\u20131957: #2, 14,937,600 viewers<ref>{{cite web|url=http://classictvhits.com/tvratings/1956.htm |title=TV Ratings: 1956\u20131957 |publisher=ClassicTVHits.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-24}}</ref>\n* 1957\u20131958: #27, 11,444,160 viewers<ref>{{cite web|url=http://classictvhits.com/tvratings/1957.htm |title=TV Ratings: 1957\u20131958 |publisher=ClassicTVHits.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-24}}</ref>\n* 1958\u20131959: N/A\n* 1959\u20131960: #12, 12,810,000 viewers<ref>{{cite web|url=http://classictvhits.com/tvratings/1959.htm |title=TV Ratings: 1959\u20131960 |publisher=ClassicTVHits.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-24}}</ref>\n* 1960\u20131961: #15, 11,800,000 viewers<ref>{{cite web|url=http://classictvhits.com/tvratings/1960.htm |title=TV Ratings: 1960\u20131961 |publisher=ClassicTVHits.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-24}}</ref>\n* 1961\u20131962: #19, 11,381,525 viewers<ref>{{cite web|url=http://classictvhits.com/tvratings/1961.htm |title=TV Ratings: 1961\u20131962 |publisher=ClassicTVHits.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-24}}</ref>\n* 1962\u20131963: #14, 12,725,900 viewers<ref>{{cite web|url=http://classictvhits.com/tvratings/1962.htm |title=TV Ratings: 1962\u20131963 |publisher=ClassicTVHits.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-24}}</ref>\n* 1963\u20131964: #8, 14,190,000 viewers<ref>{{cite web|url=http://classictvhits.com/tvratings/1963.htm |title=TV Ratings: 1963\u20131964 |publisher=ClassicTVHits.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-24}}</ref>\n* 1964\u20131965: #16, 13,280,400 viewers<ref>{{cite web|url=http://classictvhits.com/tvratings/1964.htm |title=TV Ratings: 1964\u20131965 |publisher=ClassicTVHits.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-24}}</ref>\n* 1965\u20131966: #18, 12,493,200 viewers<ref>{{cite web|url=http://classictvhits.com/tvratings/1965.htm |title=TV Ratings: 1965\u20131966 |publisher=ClassicTVHits.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-24}}</ref>\n* 1966\u20131967: #13, 12,569,640 viewers<ref>{{cite web|url=http://classictvhits.com/tvratings/1966.htm |title=TV Ratings: 1966\u20131967 |publisher=ClassicTVHits.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-24}}</ref>\n* 1967\u20131968: #13, 13,147,440 viewers<ref>{{cite web|url=http://classictvhits.com/tvratings/1967.htm |title=TV Ratings: 1967\u20131968 |publisher=ClassicTVHits.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-24}}</ref>\n* 1968\u20131969: #23, 12,349,000 viewers<ref>{{cite web|url=http://classictvhits.com/tvratings/1968.htm |title=TV Ratings: 1968\u20131969 |publisher=ClassicTVHits.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-24}}</ref>\n* 1969\u20131970: #27, 11,875,500 viewers<ref>{{cite web|url=http://classictvhits.com/tvratings/1969.htm |title=TV Ratings: 1969\u20131970 |publisher=ClassicTVHits.com |date= |accessdate=2011-09-24}}</ref>\n* 1970\u20131971: N/A\n\nHighlights:\n\n9/09/1956:{{Clarify|reason=ambiguous date format|date=December 2017}} [[Elvis Presley]]'s first appearance yielding an 82.6 percentage share, the highest in television history for any program up to the present.

These include:\n\n* [[Will Jordan]] was best known for his uncanny impersonation of Sullivan as the show's host.\n* Numerous music videos, such as [[Billy Joel]]'s \"Tell Her About It\" (featuring [[Will Jordan]] as Sullivan), [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]]'s \"[[In Bloom]]\", [[Grinspoon]]'s \"Hold On Me\", [[Outkast]]'s \"[[Hey Ya!]]\", the [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]]'s \"[[Dani California]]\" and [[Bring Me The Horizon]]'s \"Drown\" have all parodied the show's visual style.\n* [[Rain: A Tribute to the Beatles]] open their concerts with prerecorded footage of a man doing an intentionally poor Sullivan impression in black and white and then introducing the band, which plays the first part of the show with an exact recreation of the set the Beatles used.\n* ''[[All You Need Is Cash]]'' (1978), a [[mockumentary]] about a fictional group, [[The Rutles]].

And in the episode where Fred brings home a lion cub, Barney performs a trick with the now grown up lion and mentioned that he saw a similar stunt on the \"Ed Shalevan\" show.\n* [[Gabe Kaplan]] did a comedy skit in the 1970s (also featured on his 1974 album ''Holes and Mellow Rolls'' as \"Ed Sullivan, Ed Sullivan\"), that had him impersonate a drunken Sullivan on his final show, being nasty in general to his audience and guest stars, and finally saying good night to the audience.\n* The 1994 film ''[[Pulp Fiction]]'' features a scene in a 50s\u201360s-themed restaurant where Jerome Patrick Hoban does an imitation of Ed Sullivan introducing acts.\n* The direct-to-video children's film ''[[The Wiggles]]: You Make Me Feel Like Dancing!'' includes a video for the song \"Shimmy Shake\" which depicts the group appearing on ''The Ed Sullivan Show''.

A line of tracks was built by the CRRLI from [[Flushing, Queens|Flushing]] to Bethpage Junction, and later extended to the Babylon shoreline via the aforementioned Babylon Extension. At [[Garden City, New York|Garden City]] a spur line was also built to service residents of [[Hempstead (village), New York|Hempstead]]. At the time, Stewart was building Garden City, one of the first [[planned community|planned suburban]] communities in the United States. The railroad had a dual purpose in that it was to service Stewart's Bethpage Brickworks (within the hamlet now called [[Old Bethpage]]), which was supplying the building materials to the Garden City construction site. The railroad also supplied the new residents of Garden City with both commuter service to [[Long Island City]], where they could then connect to ferries into Manhattan. Service along the Babylon extension also was popular for excursions to the Babylon shoreline and to ferries to [[Fire Island, New York|Fire Island]].\n\nIn 1876 the CRRLI was acquired by the LIRR and Stewart's line became known as the LIRR's Central Branch. The portion from [[Flushing, Queens|Flushing]] to the Creedmoor Rifle Range, which became [[Creedmoor State Hospital]]) was abandoned in 1879, although the tracks were not removed until World War I. The portion from Creedmoor to [[Floral Park, New York|Floral Park]] survived as freight service and was known as the [[Creedmoor Branch]] until service ended in the late 1960s and the tracks removed from the LIRR map in the early 1970s. The LIRR used the Central's right of way between Floral Park and Garden City along with the Central's spur line to Hempstead to make up what is the railroad's current day [[Hempstead Branch]]. Past the Garden City station the Central Branch continued on a straight path through central Nassau County past the [[Nassau Veterans Memorial Coliseum]] and Eisenhower Park until Bethpage Junction and then southeast to Babylon via the Babylon Extension.\n\nIn 1925 the Stewart's Central branch was severed from its connection to the Babylon extension with the reconfiguration of [[Bethpage Branch|Bethpage Junction]]. The portion of the line from Garden City to just west of the disconnection at Bethpage Junction were called the Central Extension. The Babylon Extension was fully rebuilt, also in 1925, with the main purpose of providing a connection between the two main trunk lines of the LIRR, the Main Line and Montauk Branch, and thus became known as the aforementioned Central Branch. In 1939 the Central Extension between Garden City and the end of line in Bethpage was abandoned for regular passenger service. During World War II the eastern portion of the rail was removed and sold for scrap. After World War II a portion of the track was rebuilt to move materials for the construction of [[Levittown, New York|Levittown]], however, it never again reached Bethpage Junction (thus, nor Babylon), and those tracks too were soon removed.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{attached KML|display=inline,title}}\n*{{commons category-inline|Central Branch (Long Island Rail Road)}}\n*{{wikisource-inline|The Long Island Rail Road: A Comprehensive History, Part Two: The Flushing, North Shore & Central Railroad}}\n*[http://arrts-arrchives.com/cextrr.html Central Branch of the Long Island Rail Road(The Stewart Line)] (Arrt's Arrchives)\n*[http://www.arrts-arrchives.com/cext5.html The Stewart Line 2] \n*[http://docs.unh.edu/NY/islp04sw.jpg 1903 map showing Central Branch], then named \"Hempstead Branch\".\n\n{{Long Island Rail Road}}\n\n[[Category:Long Island Rail Road branches]]\n[[Category:Transportation in Nassau County, New York]]\n[[Category:Transportation in Suffolk County, New York]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox rail line\n|name        = Central Branch\n|color       = Central\n|image       = DE30 408 West Babylon DSC 0384.JPG\n|image_width = 300px\n|caption     = LIRR #408 ([[EMD DE30AC and DM30AC|EMD DE30AC]]) leads an eastbound service on the Central Branch in West Babylon in 2012.\n|type        = [[Commuter rail|Commuter]] and [[freight train|freight rail]]\n|system      = [[Long Island Rail Road]]\n|status      = Operational\n|locale      = [[Long Island]], New York, USA\n|start       = Bethpage\n|end         = Babylon\n|stations    = 0 (2 former)\n|routes      = {{rail color box|system=LIRR|line=Montauk}}\n|daily_ridership = \n|open        =\n|close       =\n|owner       = [[Long Island Rail Road]]\n|operator    = [[Metropolitan Transportation Authority]] (passenger)<br />[[New York and Atlantic Railway]] (freight)\n|character   =\n|stock       =\n|linelength  = {{convert|7|mi|km}}\n|tracklength =\n|tracks = 1\n|gauge       = {{RailGauge|ussg}}\n|speed       =\n|elevation   =\n|map         = \n{{Routemap\n|inline = yes\n|map=\n  CONTgq\\ABZq+r\\CONTfq~~ ~~ ~~[[Main Line (Long Island Rail Road)|Main Line]]\n  eHST~~ ~~ ~~{{lirrs|South Farmingdale}}\n  STR+GRZq~~ ~~ ~~{{BSsplit|[[Nassau County, New York|Nassau County]]|[[Suffolk County, New York|Suffolk County]]|line=-}} \n  RP4e\\SKRZ-G4ho\\RP4w~~ ~~ ~~{{jct|rdt=y|state=NY|Parkway|Southern}}\n  eHST~~ ~~ ~~{{rws|Breslau|LIRR}}\n  RP4e\\SKRZ-G4ho\\RP4w~~ ~~ ~~{{jct|rdt=y|state=NY|NY|27|name1=[[Sunrise Highway]]}}\n  CONTgq\\ABZql\\CONTfq~~ ~~ ~~[[Montauk Branch]]\n  }}\n|map_state     = uncollapsed\n}}\n\nThe '''Central Branch''' is a [[rail line]] owned and operated by the [[Long Island Rail Road]] (LIRR) in the [[U.S. state]] of [[New York (state)|New York]], extending from {{coord|40.734|-73.470|display=inline}} just east of [[Bethpage station]] to {{coord|40.696|-73.341|display=inline}} just west of [[Babylon station]].

He began at his hometown club [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]] before also playing for [[Brighton & Hove Albion F.C.|Brighton]], [[Oxford United F.C.|Oxford United]], [[Bradford City A.F.C.|Bradford City]], [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] and [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] as well as spells at [[Galatasaray S.K. (football team)|Galatasaray]] and [[S.L. Benfica|Benfica]].\n\nHe was capped 75 times at senior level for Wales between 1986 and 2001, scoring 22 times, making him one of the nation's highest-scoring and most-capped players of all time, although Wales never qualified for any major international competitions while Saunders was playing for them.\n\nFollowing his retirement from playing in 2001, he entered football coaching and then management, firstly of non-league [[Wrexham A.F.C.|Wrexham]] (2008\u20132011) and since then of [[Doncaster Rovers F.C.|Doncaster Rovers]] (2011\u20132013), [[Wolverhampton Wanderers

in [[Swansea]]<ref name=\"Hugman\"/> and began his career with [[Swansea City A.F.C.|Swansea City]], where his father [[Roy Saunders|Roy]] had been a player and coach, signing as an apprentice on leaving school in 1980.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nHe turned professional in the summer of 1982, after Swansea had finished sixth in their debut season as a [[Football League First Division|First Division]] club.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} Swansea were relegated in [[1982\u201383 in English football|1982\u201383]], and Saunders made his debut in the [[1983\u201384 in English football|1983\u201384 season]].{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} A goalless four-game loan spell at local rivals Cardiff City also came in 1984\u201385, before he signed for Second Division club Brighton & Hove Albion on a free transfer on 7 August 1985.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n===Brighton and Oxford===\nThe striker was a success at the [[Goldstone Ground]], scoring 14 league goals in his first season.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} He scored six goals from 30 league games in [[1986\u201387 in English football|1986\u201387]] before a \u00a360,000 move took him to the [[Football League First Division|First Division]] with [[Oxford United F.C.|Oxford United]].{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} He was an instant success as his six goals in the final 12 league games secured First Division survival.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nHe scored 12 goals in 37 games during the 1987\u201388 season (during which [[Maurice Evans (footballer, born 1936)|Maurice

most of the country's top clubs queue up in their bid to capture Saunders' services, and Everton were favourites to sign him, and there were also approaches from [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa's]] new

first full season in charge.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nSaunders scored 23 goals in all competitions, though just 10 of these were the league where the club only managed a sixth-place finish - one of their lowest positions since their current top flight tenure began in 1962.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} He became the first Liverpool player to score four goals in a European fixture when he did so during a 6\u20131 home win over [[FC Kuusysi|Kuusysi Lahti]] in the [[UEFA Cup]] first round first leg on 18 September 1991 that was their first European fixture after their six-year ban.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} He also scored twice against [[FC Swarovski Tirol|FC Tirol]] in the third round first leg and a hat-trick in the return

for the [[1991\u201392 Liverpool F.C. season|1991-1992 season]].\n\n===Aston Villa===\nOn 1 September 1992, Saunders became [[Aston Villa F.C.|Aston Villa]]'s record signing in a \u00a32.5 million deal that reunited him with former Liverpool players [[Steve Staunton]] and [[Ray Houghton]] at [[Villa Park]].{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} He managed six goals in his first four league games including two on his home debut against the club who had sold him; he also scored the winning goal at [[Anfield]] later in the season.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nHere, he developed a strong partnership with [[Dalian Atkinson]] until the latter suffered an injury midway through the season.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} Linking up with [[Dwight Yorke]], Saunders continued scoring as Villa challenged for [[1992\u201393 FA Premier League|the inaugural Premier League title]] but the team ultimately finished runners-up behind [[Manchester United F.C.|Manchester United]].{{citation

2017}}\n\nSaunders and Villa found goals harder to come by in the league in [[1993\u201394 FA Premier League|the following season]] and he only managed 10, three coming from hat-trick scored against [[Swindon Town F.C.|Swindon]].{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} He did however manage six more in cup competitions, with his goals against [[Birmingham City F.C.|Birmingham City]] and [[Tranmere Rovers F.C.|Tranmere]] helping Aston Villa reach the [[1994 Football League Cup Final|1994 League Cup Final]] where they beat Manchester United 3\u20131, as Saunders scored twice to end Villa's 12-year wait for a major trophy.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nDespite his best goalscoring season for the club with 17 goals, the [[1994\u201395 in English football|1994\u201395 season]] saw Villa finish only one place short of relegation \u2014 two years after they had come one place short of the league title.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} At one stage during the campaign Saunders recorded a run of seven goals in six games, including braces against [[Wimbledon F.C.|Wimbledon]] in a 7\u20131 victory, and [[Sheffield Wednesday]].{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} His final Villa goal came against [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] and despite not scoring in his final twelve appearances for the club he was named the Supporters' Player of the Year.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\n===Galatasaray===\nAs part of new Villa manager [[Brian Little (footballer)|Brian Little]]'s rebuilding programme, which resulted in many players of the Ron Atkinson era being sold, Saunders was off-loaded to Turkish club [[Galatasaray S.K. (football team)|Galatasaray]] on 1 July 1995 for \u00a32.35 million (a large sum for a 31-year-old player), where he reunited with his former Liverpool manager [[Graeme Souness]]. In fact, according to [[Shelley Webb|Shelley Webb's]] book ''Footballers' Wives Tell Their Tales'', the first Saunders' wife Helen knew of the move was when she went to Turkey with him one weekend, to find that by Monday he had signed for the [[Istanbul]] club and this was her new home.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}\n\nIn the 1996 [[Turkish Cup|T\u00fcrkiye Kupas\u0131]] final, Saunders scored the only goal of the first-leg before scoring an equalising goal in extra-time of the away leg against rivals [[Fenerbah\u00e7e S.K.]] to win the cup for Gala.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.wsc.co.uk/the-archive/32-Managers/6854-least-said-souness-forgotten|title=Least said Souness forgotten|date=15 September 1996|work=When Saturday Comes}}</ref>\n\n===Later career===\nSaunders spent one season at Galatasaray, before he returned to the Premier League with [[Nottingham Forest F.C.|Nottingham Forest]] in 1996 for \u00a31.5m.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} His only season at the [[City Ground]] was a disappointment with a shortage of goals which contributed to Forest's relegation before joining [[Sheffield United F.C.|Sheffield United]] in [[Football League Championship|Division One]].{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} Whilst at Sheffield United he is remembered for an ingenious passage of play which resulted in a cheeky goal for his team.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}} In a game against Port Vale, Saunders chased a long ball down with Vale keeper [[Paul Musselwhite]], Musselwhite won the race and knocked the ball out for a throw in, only for Saunders to quickly pick it up and throw it onto the keeper's back, and then proceed to curl it into the goal from 25 yards.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sportinglife.com/football/cc_championship/sheffu/reports/story_get.cgi?STORY_NAME=soccer/98/03/28/SOCCER_Sheff_Utd_Lead.html&TEAMHD=sheffu&DIV=nat1&TEAM=SHEFFIELD--UNITED&RH=Sheffield--United&PREV_SEASON=1996 |title=Sheff Utd 2 Port Vale 1 |publisher=Sporting Life |date=28 March 1998 |accessdate=10 February 2010 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>\n\nSaunders remained at Sheffield United for two years before another spell abroad with [[S.L.

Late{{clarify|date=August 2018}} [[rugby football|rugby]] clubs also referred to themselves, or continue to refer to themselves, as simply a \"football club\", or as a \"rugby football club\". \"[[Sports club|Club]]\" has always meant an independent entity and, during the historical period in question, very few [[high school]] or university ''teams'' were independent of the educational institutions concerned. Consequently, school and university football teams were seldom referred to as \"clubs\". That has always been the case, for example, in [[American football]], which has always had ties to [[college sport]] in general. Conversely, however, the ''oldest'' still-existing \"football club\" with a well-documented, continuous history is [[Dublin University Football Club]], a rugby union club founded in 1854 at [[Trinity College, Dublin]], [[Ireland (country of the United Kingdom)|Ireland]], although there exists some record of [[Guy's Hospital Football Club]] being founded in 1843.\n\n==British Isles==\n\n===Defunct clubs===\n\n{{multiple image\n | align = right\n | direction = vertical\n | width = 250\n | header =\n | image1 = Bodyguard vs Fearnoughts 1841.png\n | caption1 =\n | image2 = Bodyguard vs Fearnoughts Report 1842.png\n | alt2 =\n | caption2 = Newspaper articles describing the game between the Body-guard Club and the Fear-nought Club, held on Christmas Day 1841}}\nWhile the first clubs emerged in Britain, possibly as early as the fifteenth century, these are poorly-documented and defunct.
