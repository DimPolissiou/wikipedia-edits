''Tao'' means ''[[pottery]]'', which was a very important invention and tool in ancient China; ''Tang'' was the ancient name for the place currently is part of central China and the central plain of [[Shanxi Province]]. Yao's tribe combined the names of pottery and their resident place as their clan name . The [[Kinship|descendants]] of Yao continued using the surname Tang instead of ''Tao-Tang'', probably for simplification purpose.\n* From the King Tang Shuyu\n** In the early [[Zhou Dynasty]] (Western Zhou), when the [[King Cheng of Zhou]] was still a child, one day he played a game with his young brother [[Tang Shuyu]]. The King Cheng of Zhou cut a [[Vernicia fordii|tung]] [[leaf]] to a Jade Gui (Chinese: \u7389\u73ea, a kind of [[jade]] article representing authority and trust) shape, sent to Tang Shuyu, and said: you are raised to the [[Marquis]] of Tang (Chinese: \u5510\u4faf, ''Tang'' here stands for the same place as mentioned above).

The origin is the result of exportation of kizomba abroad, as well the Angolan community in diaspora introduction of the Kizomba into different countries mainly Portugal, France, UK, the Netherlands and Spain between 1980\u20132003. It was first popularized in social media sites such as YouTube and Vimeo. However, the name Urban Kiz was created in Paris, France somewhere between 2012 and 2014 (Dancer Curtis Seldon claims to be dancing since 2008, not known if he referred to Urban Kiz). Around 2012 the dance still went under various names, such as Kizomba 2.0, French Style Kizomba, New Style Kizomba, because no consensus was reached on a final name. The dance style evolved influenced by Ghettozouk and remixes with R&B, Rap, Dance and Hip Hop.<ref>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CRirkDBBeUQ</ref> The newly created dance was still sold as Kizomba although it changed from Kizomba completely. After fights in 2015 the new name Urban Kiz was created and publicly announced. Though there is some controversy around the origins of the style, it's widely accepted that the brand Urban Kiz was pioneered in Paris by famous dancers VersuS, Curtis Seldon, Enah Lebon, and Moun. <ref>{{Citation|last=Enah Lebon|title=KIZOMBA introduce URBAN KIZ|date=2015-07-26|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zQktcUoJVVk|access-date=2018-10-31}}</ref> \n\nSo the Urban stands for the RnB-related music (Ghetto-Zouk) it was danced to and the Kiz is only there to show that it was influenced by Kizomba. Urban Kiz is not the short form for Urban [[Kizomba]], but unfortunately many misuse the Kiz to still sell it as Kizomba. As the music changed, the dancers made new interpretations on how to move to this music. The main difference with Urban Kiz is that the dancers generally keep more distance between them and often don't have the chest-to-chest connection as is common with Kizomba. The legs are straight and the energy is different with much more body tension in Urban Kiz. The figures made often also require movement along straight lines or changing direction only at perpendicular angles or reversing direction. Pivots and pirouettes of the lady are also more common in Urban Kiz than in Kizomba, although they did appear in Kizomba and especially in [[Semba]] (Kizomba was derived mainly from Semba influences), but not as much, since the chest-to-chest frame did not allow for it as much. The Urban Music is also slower but the dance has still many dynamic changes of pace, with slow transitions, accelerations and breaks. Contratempos are also often performed and preferably in synchronization with the Urban Kiz and Ghetto-Zouk-beat. The Urban Kiz is also characterized by dancing on a line and feint movements of the legs of men and the hip movements or popping of ladies, especially to tarraxinha music.<ref>{{Citation|last=B.M MUSICTV|title=URBAN KIZ ??

It has been serialized in ''[[Weekly Sh\u014dnen Champion]]'' since September 8, 2016, with the chapters collected into 18 ''[[tank\u014dbon]]'' volumes as of April 8, 2020. The story takes place in a world of modern, civilized, [[anthropomorphic]] animals with a cultural divide between the [[carnivore]]s and [[herbivore]]s. The series takes its name from the in-universe rank of Beastar, an individual of great talent, service, and notoriety.\n\nAn [[anime]] television series adaptation by [[Orange (animation studio)|Orange]] aired from October 8 to December 26, 2019 on [[Fuji TV]]'s [[+Ultra]] programming block. A second season is scheduled for release in 2021. ''Beastars'' has won multiple awards, including being the first [[Akita Shoten]] title to take home the [[Manga Taish\u014d]] Award.

As a member of the school's drama club, Legoshi works as a stagehand and supports the actors of the club headed by the star pupil Louis, a [[red deer]]. \n\nOut of nowhere, Tem the [[alpaca]] is brutally murdered and devoured in the night, setting off a wave of unease and distrust between the herbivore and carnivore students.

While running away through the market, Legoshi is overcome by the scent of meat and passes out in a back alley. There he is picked up by the Black Market's psychotherapist and guardian, who explains to Legoshi that his feelings for Haru are actually his predatory instincts disguised as romantic feelings.

Legoshi saves a young wolf girl named Juno from a couple of bullies, winning her affection. Later, he, Aoba and a group of their peers go downtown to city hall to collect information for the Meteorite Festival. Then, after spending the day in the city, they get lost and stray into a district called the Black Market, where Legoshi is horrified to see herbivores selling their own body parts to passing carnivores. While running away through the market, Legoshi is overcome by the scent of meat and passes out in a back alley. There he is picked up by the Black Market's psychotherapist and guardian, who explains to Legoshi that his feelings for Haru are actually his predatory instincts disguised as romantic feelings. When Legoshi explains to him that he has no prior experience with love, he gives him a rabbit-themed erotic magazine to test whether those feelings are based on love or predatory instincts. On his way back to school, Legoshi runs into Aoba, who was likewise disgusted by the Black Market, and the two reconcile.

These people may be distinguished by [[nobility]], [[wealth]], [[education]] or [[corporate]], [[religious]], [[political]], or [[military]] control. Such states are often controlled by families who pass their influence from one [[generation]] to the next, but [[inheritance]] is not a necessary condition of oligarchy.\n\nThroughout history, oligarchies have often been [[tyrant|tyrannical]], relying on public obedience or [[oppression]] to exist. [[Aristotle]] pioneered the use of the term as meaning rule by the rich,<ref>Winters (2011) p. 26-28. \"Aristotle writes that 'oligarchy is when men of property have the government in their hands... wherever men rule by reason of their wealth, whether they be few or many, that is an oligarchy, and where the poor rule, that is a democracy'.\"</ref> for which another term commonly used today is [[plutocracy]]. In the early 20th century [[Robert Michels]] developed the theory that democracies, as all large organizations, have a tendency to turn into oligarchies. In his \"[[Iron law of oligarchy]]\" he suggests that the necessary division of labor in large organizations leads to the establishment of a ruling class mostly concerned with protecting their own power.\n\nThis was already recognized by the [[Athenian]]s in the fourth century [[BCE]]: after the restoration of [[democracy]] from oligarchical coups, they used the [[Sortition|drawing of lots]] for selecting government officers to counteract that tendency toward oligarchy in government.<ref>Hansen, Mogens Herman (1991).

These people may be distinguished by [[nobility]], [[wealth]], [[education]] or [[corporate]], [[religious]], [[political]], or [[military]] control. Such states are often controlled by families who pass their influence from one [[generation]] to the next, but [[inheritance]] is not a necessary condition of oligarchy.\n\nThroughout history, oligarchies have often been [[tyrant|tyrannical]], relying on public obedience or [[oppression]] to exist. [[Aristotle]] pioneered the use of the term as meaning rule by the rich,<ref>Winters (2011) p. 26-28. \"Aristotle writes that 'oligarchy is when men of property have the government in their hands... wherever men rule by reason of their wealth, whether they be few or many, that is an oligarchy, and where the poor rule, that is a democracy'.\"</ref> for which another term commonly used today is [[plutocracy]]. In the early 20th century [[Robert Michels]] developed the theory that democracies, as all large organizations, have a tendency to turn into oligarchies. In his \"[[Iron law of oligarchy]]\" he suggests that the necessary division of labor in large organizations leads to the establishment of a ruling class mostly concerned with protecting their own power.\n\nThis was already recognized by the [[Athenian]]s in the fourth century [[BCE]]: after the restoration of [[democracy]] from oligarchical coups, they used the [[Sortition|drawing of lots]] for selecting government officers to counteract that tendency toward oligarchy in government.<ref>Hansen, Mogens Herman (1991).

Transmission of the virus from pigs to humans is not common and does not always lead to [[human flu]], often resulting only in the production of [[antibody|antibodies]] in the blood. If transmission does cause human flu, it is called [[zoonosis|zoonotic]] swine flu. People with regular exposure to pigs are at increased risk of swine flu infection.\n\nAround the mid-20th century, identification of influenza subtypes became possible, allowing accurate diagnosis of transmission to humans. Since then, only 50 such transmissions have been confirmed. These strains of swine flu rarely pass from human to human. Symptoms of zoonotic swine flu in humans are similar to those of [[influenza]] and of [[influenza-like illness]] in general, namely [[chills]], [[fever]], [[pharyngitis|sore throat]], [[myalgia|muscle pains]], severe [[headache]], [[cough]]ing, [[fatigue (medical)|weakness]], shortness of breath, and [[malaise|general discomfort]].\n\nIt is estimated that in the [[2009 flu pandemic]] 11\u201321% of the then global population (of about 6.8 billion), or around 700 million to 1.4 billion people, contracted the illness\u2014more in absolute terms than the Spanish flu pandemic.

It is an enveloped virus; the outer layer is a lipid membrane which is taken from the host cell in which the virus multiplies. Inserted into the lipid membrane are \"spikes\", which are proteins\u2014actually glycoproteins, because they consist of protein linked to sugars\u2014known as HA ([[hemagglutinin]]) and NA ([[neuraminidase]]). These are the proteins that determine the subtype of influenza virus (A/H1N1, for example).  The HA and NA are important in the immune response against the virus; antibodies (proteins made to combat infection) against these spikes may protect against infection.

Proper hand washing techniques can prevent the virus from spreading. Avoid touching the eyes, nose, or mouth. Stay away from others who display symptoms of the cold or flu and avoid contact with others when displaying symptoms.\n\n===Swine===\nMethods of preventing the spread of influenza among swine include facility management, herd management, and vaccination ([[ATCvet]] code: {{ATCvet|I09|AA03}}). Because much of the illness and death associated with swine flu involves secondary infection by other pathogens, control strategies that rely on vaccination may be insufficient.\n\nControl of swine influenza by vaccination has become more difficult in recent decades, as the [[evolution]] of the [[virus]] has resulted in inconsistent responses to traditional vaccines. Standard commercial swine flu vaccines are effective in controlling the infection when the virus strains match enough to have significant cross-protection, and custom (autogenous) vaccines made from the specific viruses isolated are created and used in the more difficult cases.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nationalhogfarmer.com/mag/swine_flu_virus_endemic/|publisher=National Hog Farmer|title=Swine flu virus turns endemic|date=15 September 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.livestock.novartis.com/cv_swine.html |publisher=Novartis |work=Custom Vaccines |title=Swine |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090430094251/http://www.livestock.novartis.com/cv_swine.html |archive-date=April 30, 2009 }}</ref>\nPresent [[Influenza vaccine|vaccination]] strategies for SIV control and prevention in swine farms typically include the use of one of several bivalent SIV vaccines commercially available in the United States. Of the 97 recent H3N2 isolates examined, only 41 isolates had strong serologic cross-reactions with antiserum to three commercial SIV vaccines. Since the protective ability of influenza vaccines depends primarily on the closeness of the match between the vaccine virus and the epidemic virus, the presence of nonreactive H3N2 SIV variants suggests current commercial vaccines might not effectively protect pigs from infection with a majority of H3N2 viruses.<ref name=\"pmid17366454\"/><ref>{{Cite journal|vauthors=Gramer MR, Lee JH, Choi YK, Goyal SM, Joo HS |title=Serologic and genetic characterization of North American H3N2 swine influenza A viruses|journal=Canadian Journal of Veterinary Research|volume=71|issue=3|pages=201\u201306|date=July 2007|pmid=17695595|pmc=1899866}}</ref> The United States Department of Agriculture researchers say while pig vaccination keeps pigs from getting sick, it does not block infection or shedding of the virus.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20227063.800-swine-flu-the-predictable-pandemic.html?full=true/|title=Swine flu: The predictable pandemic?|date=2009-04-29}}</ref>\n\nFacility management includes using disinfectants and ambient temperature to control viruses in the environment. They are unlikely to survive outside living cells for more than two weeks, except in cold (but above freezing) conditions, and are readily inactivated by disinfectants.<ref name=Merck/> Herd management includes not adding pigs carrying influenza to herds that have not been exposed to the virus. The virus survives in healthy carrier pigs for up to three months, and can be recovered from them between outbreaks. Carrier pigs are usually responsible for the introduction of SIV into previously uninfected herds and countries, so new animals should be [[quarantine]]d.<ref name=cfsph/> After an outbreak, as immunity in exposed pigs wanes, new outbreaks of the same strain can occur.<ref name=Merck/>\n\n===Humans===\n;Prevention of pig-to-human transmission\n[[File:AntigenicShift HiRes.svg|thumb]] Swine can be infected by both avian and human flu strains of influenza, and therefore are hosts where the [[antigenic shift]]s can occur that create new influenza strains.\n\nThe transmission from swine to humans is believed to occur mainly in swine farms, where farmers are in close contact with live pigs. Although strains of swine influenza are usually not able to infect humans, it may occasionally happen, so farmers and veterinarians are encouraged to use face [[surgical mask|masks]] when dealing with infected animals. The use of vaccines on swine to prevent their infection is a major method of limiting swine-to-human transmission. Risk factors that may contribute to swine-to-human transmission include smoking and, especially, not wearing gloves when working with sick animals, thereby increasing the likelihood of subsequent hand-to-eye, hand-to-nose, or hand-to-mouth transmission.<ref>{{Cite journal|vauthors=Ramirez A, Capuano AW, Wellman DA, Lesher KA, Setterquist SF, Gray GC |title=Preventing Zoonotic Influenza Virus Infection|journal=Emerging Infect.

These studies show that whites are much more likely to be vaccinated for seasonal influenza and for the H1N1 strain than African Americans <ref>Uscher-Pines, Lori, Jurgen Maurer, and Katherine M. Harris. \"Racial And Ethnic Disparities In Uptake And Location Of Vaccination For 2009\u2013H1N1 And Seasonal Influenza.\" ''American Journal of Public Health'' 101.7 (2011)  1252\u201355. SocINDEX with Full Text. Web. 6 Dec. 2011.</ref> This could be due to several factors.  Historically, there has been mistrust of vaccines and of the medical community from African Americans.  Many African Americans do not believe vaccines or doctors to be effective.  This mistrust stems from the exploitation of the African American communities during studies like the [[Tuskegee syphilis experiment|Tuskegee study]].  Additionally, vaccines are typically administered in clinics, hospitals, or doctor's offices.  Many people of lower socioeconomic status are less likely to receive vaccinations because they do not have health insurance.\n\n===Surveillance===\nAlthough there is no  formal national surveillance system in the United States to determine what viruses are circulating in pigs,<ref name=\"MMWR5815a5\">{{cite journal|url=https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5815a5.htm|title=Swine influenza A (H1N1) infection in two children \u2013 Southern California, March\u2013April 2009|date=22 April 2009|journal=Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report|volume=58 (Dispatch)|issue=1\u20133|author1= Ginsberg M, Hopkins J|display-authors=etal}}</ref> an informal surveillance network in the United States is part of a world surveillance network.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thebulletin.org/animals-worlds-best-and-cheapest-biosensors|title=Animals: The world's best (and cheapest) biosensors|author=Laura H.

Antibiotics are also used to treat the disease, which, although they have no effect against the influenza virus, do help prevent bacterial [[pneumonia]] and other [[secondary infection]]s in influenza-weakened herds.<ref name=\"cfsph\"/>\n\nIn Europe the avian-like H1N1 and the human-like H3N2 and H1N2 are the most common influenza subtypes in swine, of which avian-like H1N1 is the most frequent. Since 2009 another subtype, pdmH1N1(2009), emerged globally and also in European pig population. The prevalence varies from country to country but all of the subtypes are continuously circulating in swine herds.\nIn the EU region whole-virus vaccines are available which are inactivated and adjuvanted. Vaccination of sows is common practice and reveals also a benefit to young pigs by prolonging the maternally level of antibodies. Several commercial vaccines are available including a trivalent one being used in sow vaccination and a vaccine against pdmH1N1(2009). In vaccinated sows multiplication of viruses and virus shedding are significantly reduced.\n\n===Humans===\nIf a person becomes sick with swine flu, antiviral drugs can make the illness milder and make the patient feel better faster. They may also prevent serious flu complications. For treatment, antiviral drugs work best if started soon after getting sick (within two days of symptoms).

Around 1918, the ancestral virus, of avian origin, crossed the species boundaries and infected humans as human H1N1. The same phenomenon took place soon after in America, where the human virus was infecting pigs; it led to the emergence of the H1N1 swine strain, which later became the classic{{clarify|date=May 2014}} swine flu. However, genetic coding of H1N1 shows it is a combination of segments of 4 influenza viruses forming a novel strain\u2013\nNorth American Swine (30.6%) \u2013 PIG ORIGIN FLU\nNorth American Avian (34.4%) \u2013 BIRD ORIGIN FLU\nHuman influenza strain (17.5%)\nEuroasian swine (17.5%) \u2013 PIG ORIGIN FLU.\nQUADRUPLE GENETIC RE-ASSORTMENT  \u2013 coinfection with influenza viruses from diverse animal species.\nDue to coinfection, the viruses are able to interact, mutate, and form a new strain to which host has variable immunity.\n\nNew events of reassortment were not reported until 1968, when the avian strain H1N1 infected humans again; this time the virus met the strain H2N2, and the reassortment originated the strain H3N2. This strain has remained as a stable flu strain until now.\n\nThe mid-1970s were important for the evolution of flu strains. First, the re-emergence of the human H1N1 strain became a seasonal strain. Then, a small outbreak of swine H1N1 occurred in humans, and finally, the human H2N2 strain apparently became extinct. Around 1979, the avian H1N1 strain infected pigs and gave rise to Euroasiatic swine flu and H1N1 Euroasiatic swine virus, which is still being transmitted in swine populations.\n\nThe critical moment for the 2009 outbreak was between 1990 and 1993. A triple reassortment event in a pig host of North American H1N1 swine virus, the human H3N2 virus and avian H1N1 virus generated the swine H1N2 strain.\nFinally, the last step in S-OIV history was in 2009, when the virus H1N2 co-infected a human host at the same time as the Euroasiatic H1N1 swine strain. This led to the emergence of a new human H1N1 strain, which caused the 2009 pandemic.\n\nOn June 11, 2009, the World Health Organization raised the worldwide pandemic alert level to Phase 6 for swine flu, which is the highest alert level.<ref name=\"Choffnes, Eileen R. 2010\">Choffnes, Eileen R., Alison Mack, and David A.

Transmission of the virus from pigs to humans is not common and does not always lead to [[human flu]], often resulting only in the production of [[antibody|antibodies]] in the blood. If transmission does cause human flu, it is called [[zoonosis|zoonotic]] swine flu. People with regular exposure to pigs are at increased risk of swine flu infection.\n\nAround the mid-20th century, identification of influenza subtypes became possible, allowing accurate diagnosis of transmission to humans. Since then, only 50 such transmissions have been confirmed. These strains of swine flu rarely pass from human to human. Symptoms of zoonotic swine flu in humans are similar to those of [[influenza]] and of [[influenza-like illness]] in general, namely [[chills]], [[fever]], [[pharyngitis|sore throat]], [[myalgia|muscle pains]], severe [[headache]], [[cough]]ing, [[fatigue (medical)|weakness]], shortness of breath, and [[malaise|general discomfort]].\n\nIt is estimated that in the [[2009 flu pandemic]] 11\u201321% of the then global population (of about 6.8 billion), or around 700 million to 1.4 billion people, contracted the illness\u2014more in absolute terms than the Spanish flu pandemic.

The 2009 outbreak showed an increased percentage of patients reporting [[diarrhea]] and [[vomiting]] as well.

Proper hand washing techniques can prevent the virus from spreading. Avoid touching the eyes, nose, or mouth. Stay away from others who display symptoms of the cold or flu and avoid contact with others when displaying symptoms.\n\n===Swine===\nMethods of preventing the spread of influenza among swine include facility management, herd management, and vaccination ([[ATCvet]] code: {{ATCvet|I09|AA03}}). Because much of the illness and death associated with swine flu involves secondary infection by other pathogens, control strategies that rely on vaccination may be insufficient.\n\nControl of swine influenza by vaccination has become more difficult in recent decades, as the [[evolution]] of the [[virus]] has resulted in inconsistent responses to traditional vaccines. Standard commercial swine flu vaccines are effective in controlling the infection when the virus strains match enough to have significant cross-protection, and custom (autogenous) vaccines made from the specific viruses isolated are created and used in the more difficult cases.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nationalhogfarmer.com/mag/swine_flu_virus_endemic/|publisher=National Hog Farmer|title=Swine flu virus turns endemic|date=15 September 2007}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.livestock.novartis.com/cv_swine.html |publisher=Novartis |work=Custom Vaccines |title=Swine |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090430094251/http://www.livestock.novartis.com/cv_swine.html |archive-date=April 30, 2009 }}</ref>\nPresent [[Influenza vaccine|vaccination]] strategies for SIV control and prevention in swine farms typically include the use of one of several bivalent SIV vaccines commercially available in the United States. Of the 97 recent H3N2 isolates examined, only 41 isolates had strong serologic cross-reactions with antiserum to three commercial SIV vaccines. Since the protective ability of influenza vaccines depends primarily on the closeness of the match between the vaccine virus and the epidemic virus, the presence of nonreactive H3N2 SIV variants suggests current commercial vaccines might not effectively protect pigs from infection with a majority of H3N2 viruses.<ref name=\"pmid17366454\"/><ref>{{Cite journal|vauthors=Gramer MR, Lee JH, Choi YK, Goyal SM, Joo HS |title=Serologic and genetic characterization of North American H3N2 swine influenza A viruses|journal=Canadian Journal of Veterinary Research|volume=71|issue=3|pages=201\u201306|date=July 2007|pmid=17695595|pmc=1899866}}</ref> The United States Department of Agriculture researchers say while pig vaccination keeps pigs from getting sick, it does not block infection or shedding of the virus.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg20227063.800-swine-flu-the-predictable-pandemic.html?full=true/|title=Swine flu: The predictable pandemic?|date=2009-04-29}}</ref>\n\nFacility management includes using disinfectants and ambient temperature to control viruses in the environment. They are unlikely to survive outside living cells for more than two weeks, except in cold (but above freezing) conditions, and are readily inactivated by disinfectants.<ref name=Merck/> Herd management includes not adding pigs carrying influenza to herds that have not been exposed to the virus. The virus survives in healthy carrier pigs for up to three months, and can be recovered from them between outbreaks. Carrier pigs are usually responsible for the introduction of SIV into previously uninfected herds and countries, so new animals should be [[quarantine]]d.<ref name=cfsph/> After an outbreak, as immunity in exposed pigs wanes, new outbreaks of the same strain can occur.<ref name=Merck/>\n\n===Humans===\n;Prevention of pig-to-human transmission\n[[File:AntigenicShift HiRes.svg|thumb]] Swine can be infected by both avian and human flu strains of influenza, and therefore are hosts where the [[antigenic shift]]s can occur that create new influenza strains.\n\nThe transmission from swine to humans is believed to occur mainly in swine farms, where farmers are in close contact with live pigs. Although strains of swine influenza are usually not able to infect humans, it may occasionally happen, so farmers and veterinarians are encouraged to use face [[surgical mask|masks]] when dealing with infected animals. The use of vaccines on swine to prevent their infection is a major method of limiting swine-to-human transmission. Risk factors that may contribute to swine-to-human transmission include smoking and, especially, not wearing gloves when working with sick animals, thereby increasing the likelihood of subsequent hand-to-eye, hand-to-nose, or hand-to-mouth transmission.<ref>{{Cite journal|vauthors=Ramirez A, Capuano AW, Wellman DA, Lesher KA, Setterquist SF, Gray GC |title=Preventing Zoonotic Influenza Virus Infection|journal=Emerging Infect.

These studies show that whites are much more likely to be vaccinated for seasonal influenza and for the H1N1 strain than African Americans <ref>Uscher-Pines, Lori, Jurgen Maurer, and Katherine M. Harris. \"Racial And Ethnic Disparities In Uptake And Location Of Vaccination For 2009\u2013H1N1 And Seasonal Influenza.\" ''American Journal of Public Health'' 101.7 (2011)  1252\u201355. SocINDEX with Full Text. Web. 6 Dec. 2011.</ref> This could be due to several factors.  Historically, there has been mistrust of vaccines and of the medical community from African Americans.  Many African Americans do not believe vaccines or doctors to be effective.  This mistrust stems from the exploitation of the African American communities during studies like the [[Tuskegee syphilis experiment|Tuskegee study]].  Additionally, vaccines are typically administered in clinics, hospitals, or doctor's offices.  Many people of lower socioeconomic status are less likely to receive vaccinations because they do not have health insurance.\n\n===Surveillance===\nAlthough there is no  formal national surveillance system in the United States to determine what viruses are circulating in pigs,<ref name=\"MMWR5815a5\">{{cite journal|url=https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5815a5.htm|title=Swine influenza A (H1N1) infection in two children \u2013 Southern California, March\u2013April 2009|date=22 April 2009|journal=Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report|volume=58 (Dispatch)|issue=1\u20133|author1= Ginsberg M, Hopkins J|display-authors=etal}}</ref> an informal surveillance network in the United States is part of a world surveillance network.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thebulletin.org/animals-worlds-best-and-cheapest-biosensors|title=Animals: The world's best (and cheapest) biosensors|author=Laura H.

Antibiotics are also used to treat the disease, which, although they have no effect against the influenza virus, do help prevent bacterial [[pneumonia]] and other [[secondary infection]]s in influenza-weakened herds.<ref name=\"cfsph\"/>\n\nIn Europe the avian-like H1N1 and the human-like H3N2 and H1N2 are the most common influenza subtypes in swine, of which avian-like H1N1 is the most frequent. Since 2009 another subtype, pdmH1N1(2009), emerged globally and also in European pig population. The prevalence varies from country to country but all of the subtypes are continuously circulating in swine herds.\nIn the EU region whole-virus vaccines are available which are inactivated and adjuvanted. Vaccination of sows is common practice and reveals also a benefit to young pigs by prolonging the maternally level of antibodies. Several commercial vaccines are available including a trivalent one being used in sow vaccination and a vaccine against pdmH1N1(2009). In vaccinated sows multiplication of viruses and virus shedding are significantly reduced.\n\n===Humans===\nIf a person becomes sick with swine flu, antiviral drugs can make the illness milder and make the patient feel better faster. They may also prevent serious flu complications. For treatment, antiviral drugs work best if started soon after getting sick (within two days of symptoms). Beside antivirals, supportive care at home or in a hospital focuses on controlling fevers, relieving pain and maintaining fluid balance, as well as identifying and treating any secondary infections or other medical problems. The U.S. [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] recommends the use of [[oseltamivir]] (Tamiflu) or [[zanamivir]] (Relenza) for the treatment and/or prevention of infection with swine influenza viruses; however, the majority of people infected with the virus make a full recovery without requiring medical attention or antiviral drugs.<ref>{{Cite web | url=http://www.who.int/csr/disease/swineflu/faq/en/index.html | title=WHO &#124; Pandemic (H1N1) 2009: Frequently asked questions}}</ref> The virus isolated in the 2009 outbreak have been found resistant to [[amantadine]] and [[rimantadine]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/swineflu/antiviral_swine.htm|title=Antiviral Drugs and Swine Influenza|publisher=Centers for Disease Control|accessdate=2009-04-27}}</ref>\n\nIn the U.S., on April 27, 2009, the FDA issued [[Emergency Use Authorization]]s to make available [[Relenza]] and [[Tamiflu]] [[antiviral drug]]s to treat the swine influenza virus in cases for which they were currently unapproved.

Around 1918, the ancestral virus, of avian origin, crossed the species boundaries and infected humans as human H1N1. The same phenomenon took place soon after in America, where the human virus was infecting pigs; it led to the emergence of the H1N1 swine strain, which later became the classic{{clarify|date=May 2014}} swine flu. However, genetic coding of H1N1 shows it is a combination of segments of 4 influenza viruses forming a novel strain\u2013\nNorth American Swine (30.6%) \u2013 PIG ORIGIN FLU\nNorth American Avian (34.4%) \u2013 BIRD ORIGIN FLU\nHuman influenza strain (17.5%)\nEuroasian swine (17.5%) \u2013 PIG ORIGIN FLU.\nQUADRUPLE GENETIC RE-ASSORTMENT  \u2013 coinfection with influenza viruses from diverse animal species.\nDue to coinfection, the viruses are able to interact, mutate, and form a new strain to which host has variable immunity.\n\nNew events of reassortment were not reported until 1968, when the avian strain H1N1 infected humans again; this time the virus met the strain H2N2, and the reassortment originated the strain H3N2. This strain has remained as a stable flu strain until now.\n\nThe mid-1970s were important for the evolution of flu strains. First, the re-emergence of the human H1N1 strain became a seasonal strain. Then, a small outbreak of swine H1N1 occurred in humans, and finally, the human H2N2 strain apparently became extinct. Around 1979, the avian H1N1 strain infected pigs and gave rise to Euroasiatic swine flu and H1N1 Euroasiatic swine virus, which is still being transmitted in swine populations.\n\nThe critical moment for the 2009 outbreak was between 1990 and 1993. A triple reassortment event in a pig host of North American H1N1 swine virus, the human H3N2 virus and avian H1N1 virus generated the swine H1N2 strain.\nFinally, the last step in S-OIV history was in 2009, when the virus H1N2 co-infected a human host at the same time as the Euroasiatic H1N1 swine strain. This led to the emergence of a new human H1N1 strain, which caused the 2009 pandemic.\n\nOn June 11, 2009, the World Health Organization raised the worldwide pandemic alert level to Phase 6 for swine flu, which is the highest alert level.<ref name=\"Choffnes, Eileen R. 2010\">Choffnes, Eileen R., Alison Mack, and David A.

The guidelines are mainly for (a) description of A H1N1 for prompt identification, detection, and distinction from the symptoms of other similar infection such as common flu (cold), (b) categorization of screening of influenza A H1N1 cases, (c) clinical management protocol of Pandemic influenza A H1N1, (d) providing home care, (e) collection of human sample.<ref>Ministry Of Health and Family Welfare, Government of India</ref> Besides, through the National Centre for Diseases Control (NCDC), Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS), Government of India (GoI) had placed a tender to procure 8 kits of Assay sets, 37 kits of one step RT-PCR kit, and 36 kits of viral RNA extraction kits.<ref>National Centre for Diseases Control (NCDC), Directorate General of Health Services (DGHS), Government of India (GoI).
