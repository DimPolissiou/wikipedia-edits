From that point on, the Oilers controlled the rest of the game. With less than 3 minutes left in the first half, Houston advanced 74 yards to score on running back [[Earl Campbell]]'s 3-yard touchdown run.

The Eagles scored first when Jaworski threw a 17-yard touchdown pass to wide receiver [[Harold Carmichael]]. Chicago responded with an 82-yard drive to score on running back [[Walter Payton]]'s 2-yard rushing touchdown. Then after Philadelphia added a field goal from [[Tony Franklin (kicker)|Tony Franklin]], Payton scored again on a 1-yard touchdown run.  Later in the second quarter, Bears lineman [[Alan Page]] recovered a fumble from Jaworski on the Eagles 16-yard line, leading to Bob Thomas' 30-yard field goal that gave Chicago a 17-10 halftime lead.\n\nIn the third quarter, Payton ripped off an 84-yard run on his first carry, but it was called back by an illegal motion penalty against receiver [[Brian Baschnagel]].  Following a punt, The Eagles tied the game on Jaworski's 29-yard touchdown pass to Carmichael.  Chicago responded with a drive to the Philadelphia 9-yard line, but defensive back [[Bob Howard (American football)|Bob Howard]] ended the scoring threat by intercepting [[Mike Phipps]] in the end zone. A few plays later, Jaworski threw a 63-yard touchdown to running back Billy Campfield to take the lead for good.\n\nOver 12 minutes remained in the game at this point, but the Bears would only manage one first down during this time. With 7:31 left, Philly defensive tackle [[Jerry Robinson (linebacker)|Jerry Robinson]] recovered a fumble from Bears receiver Dave Williams that set up Franklin's 34-yard field goal.  Chicago got one last change to score when linebacker Gary Campbell recovered a fumble from Eagles running back [[Wilbert Montgomery]] on the Philadelphia 28.  But their ensuing drive ended with another turnover, this time an interception by defensive back [[Herm Edwards]].\n\nCarmichael finished the game with 6 receptions for 111 yards and two touchdowns.\n\n==Divisional playoffs==\n\n===December 29, 1979===\n\n====AFC: Houston Oilers 17, San Diego Chargers 14====\n{{Americanfootballbox | titlestyle=text-align:center; background:#eee\n| title=Game summary|\n|Road='''Oilers'''\n|R1=0\n|R2=10\n|R3=7\n|R4=0\n|RT=17\n|Home=Chargers\n|H1=7\n|H2=0\n|H3=7\n|H4=0\n|HT=14\n|stadium= [[San Diego Stadium]], [[San Diego]]\n|time= 4:00 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EST]]\n|TV=[[NFL on NBC|NBC]]\n|TVAnnouncers=[[Dick Enberg]] and [[Merlin Olsen]]\n|attendance= 51,192\n|referee= [[Ben Dreith]]\n|scoring=\n*'''Scoring'''\n**SD \u2013 Williams 1 run (Wood kick) SD 7\u20130\n**HOU \u2013 field goal Fritsch 26 SD 7\u20133\n**HOU \u2013 Clark 1 run (Fritsch kick) HOU 10\u20137\n**SD \u2013 Mitchell 8 run (Wood kick) SD 14\u201310\n**HOU \u2013 Renfro 47 pass from Nielsen (Fritsch kick) HOU 17\u201314\n}}\nThe Oilers offense, playing without starting quarterback [[Dan Pastorini]], receiver [[Ken Burrough]], and running back [[Earl Campbell]] due to injuries, could only generate 259 yards compared to San Diego's 385. But they still won the game, largely due to the effort of rookie safety [[Vernon Perry]], who set a playoff record with 4 interceptions as the Oilers defeated the Chargers 17\u201314. In his first career playoff game, Chargers future hall of fame quarterback [[Dan Fouts]] threw for 333 yards, but was intercepted 5 times. The Chargers' high powered offense scored on their first possession of the game and of the second half but turnovers prevented further scoring.\n\n[[File:1986 Jeno's Pizza - 44 - Elvin Bethea and Carter Hartwig (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|Houston's defensive line blocking a San Diego rushing attempt during the 1979 AFC Divisional Playoff Game.]]\nSan Diego took the opening kickoff and started out strong, moving the ball 81 yards in 11 plays.  Fouts completed a 34-yard pass to tight end [[Greg McCrary]] and a 17-yarder to [[John Jefferson]] before [[Clarence Williams (running back born 1955)|Clarence Williams]]' 1-yard rushing touchdown finished the drive.  The Chargers threatened to score again on their next drive, but Perry intercepted a pass at the Houston 18-yard line.\n\nIn the second quarter, Perry blocked a field goal attempt and returned the ball 57 yards to the San Diego 28-yard line, setting up [[Toni Fritsch]]'s 26-yard field goal.  On San Diego's next drive, Perry recorded another interception and lateralled the ball to safety [[Mike Reinfeldt]], who gained 7 yards to the Chargers 38. Three plays later, Oilers quarterback [[Gifford Nielsen]] rushed 14 yards to the Chargers 4-yard line.  San Diego's defense managed to keep them out of the end zone for three plays, but on Fritch's field goal attempt, they were penalized for having 12 men on the field, moving the ball just inches away from the goal line.  On fourth and inches with 19 seconds left in the half, Houston coach [[Bum Phillips]] decided to gamble and go for the touchdown, a gamble that paid off when [[Boobie Clark]] scored on a sweep left to give the Oilers a 10\u20137 first half lead.\n\nIn the third period, Fouts connected with [[Charlie Joiner]] for 20 yards and hit tight end [[Bob Klein]] for 16, with a roughing the passer penalty turning it into a 31-yard gain. [[Lydell Mitchell]] finished the 65-yard drive with an 8-yard touchdown run to give the Chargers a 14\u201310 lead. However, Houston defensive back [[J.C. Wilson]]'s interception later gave Houston the ball at the San Diego 44-yard line.  Faced with 3rd and 13 two plays later, Nielsen threw a 47-yard touchdown pass to receiver [[Mike Renfro]], putting the Oilers back in front at 17\u201314.  There were still more than 17 minutes left in regulation, but this would be the final score. Perry recorded two more interceptions as the Oilers defense shut down the Chargers offense for the rest of the game.<ref>http://fs64sports.blogspot.com/2010_12_29_archive.html</ref><ref>https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/197912290sdg.htm</ref>\n\nAfter the game, it was revealed that the Oilers coaching staff was able to figure out the Chargers' coaches' signs as they signaled the play call from the sideline; this was one reason their defensive backs seemed to always be in the right place at the right time. \"We pretty much knew ahead of time when they were going to pass, and where they were going to pass it.\" said Oilers defensive coordinator [[Ed Biles]]. It was a monumental upset against the heavily favored Chargers, who had scored at least 26 points in 10 games during the season and had defeated both eventual Super Bowl teams, the Rams and Steelers, by a combined scoring margin of 75-23.\n\nIt was the first AFC playoff game that was a rematch of an earlier AFL championship game.\n\n====NFC: Tampa Bay Buccaneers 24, Philadelphia Eagles 17====\n{{Americanfootballbox | titlestyle=text-align:center; background:#eee\n| title=Game summary|\n|Road=Eagles\n|R1=0\n|R2=7\n|R3=3\n|R4=7\n|RT=17\n|Home='''Buccaneers'''\n|H1=7\n|H2=10\n|H3=0\n|H4=7\n|HT=24\n|stadium= [[Tampa Stadium]], [[Tampa, Florida]]\n|time= 12:30 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EST]]\n|weather= {{convert|73|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}}, scattered clouds\n|TV=[[NFL on CBS|CBS]]\n|TVAnnouncers= [[Curt Gowdy]] and [[Hank Stram]]\n|attendance= 71,402\n|referee= [[Fred Silva]]\n|scoring=\n*'''Scoring'''\n**TB \u2013 Bell 4 run (O'Donoghue kick) TB 7\u20130\n**TB \u2013 field goal O'Donoghue 40 TB 10\u20130\n**TB \u2013 Bell 1 run (O'Donoghue kick) TB 17\u20130\n**PHI \u2013 Smith 11 pass from Jaworski (Franklin kick) TB 17\u20137\n**PHI \u2013 field goal Franklin 42 17\u201310\n**TB \u2013 Giles 9 pass from Williams (O'Donoghue kick) TB 24\u201310\n**PHI \u2013 Carmichael 37 pass from Jaworski (Franklin kick) TB 24\u201317\n}}\n[[File:1986 Jeno's Pizza - 20 - Cecil Johnson (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|The Buccaneers stopping an Eagles rushing play during the 1979 NFC Divisional Playoff Game.]]\nThe Buccaneers won their first playoff game in team history by jumping to a 17\u20130 lead and holding the Eagles to 48 rushing yards, while running back [[Ricky Bell (running back)|Ricky Bell]] recorded 142 rushing yards and 2 touchdowns.\n\n[[File:1986 Jeno's Pizza - 19 - Ricky Bell crop.jpg|thumb|left|Buccaneers' running back Ricky Bell rushing the ball during the Divisional Playoff Game.]]\nTampa Bay marched on an 18-play, 80-yard opening drive that took 9:25 off the clock to score on Bell's 4-yard touchdown run.  Philadelphia responded with a drive into scoring range, but their drive ended ugly.  First they attempted a fake 47-yard field goal, but they failed to snap the ball before the play clock ran out.  Then [[Tony Franklin (kicker)|Tony Franklin]]'s 52-yard field goal was no good.  Tampa Bay took the ball back and drove to a 10\u20130 lead on Neil O'Donohue's 40-yard field goal.  Then on the Eagles next drive, running back [[Wilbert Montgomery]] lost a fumble that nose tackle [[Randy Crowder]] recovered on the Philadelphia 5-yard line.  Three plays later, Bell scored on a 1-yard fourth down run, increasing the Bucs lead to 17\u20130 with 5:12 left in the half.  Later on, Eagles linebacker [[Jerry Robinson (linebacker)|Jerry Robinson]] intercepted a pass from [[Doug Williams (quarterback)|Doug Williams]] and returned it 37 yards to set up [[Ron Jaworski]]'s 11-yard touchdown pass to [[Charlie Smith (wide receiver)|Charlie Smith]], making the score 17\u20137 by halftime.\n\nPhiladelphia took the second half kickoff and drove 45 yards to score on Franklin's 42-yard field goal, cutting the deficit to 17\u201310.  This would be the last score until 7:08 remained in the game, when Williams threw a 9-yard touchdown pass to [[Jimmie Giles]].  Now down 24\u201310, Philadelphia made a desperate comeback attempt.  First they drove 80 yards in 9 plays and scored on Jaworski's 37-yard bomb to [[Harold Carmichael]].  Their defense then forced a punt with 2:11 left in the game, giving them one last chance for a tying touchdown.  Jaworski's completions to Carmichael and Smith for gains of 16 and 25 yards moved the ball to the Bucs 45-yard line.  But his next four passes were incomplete, enabling Tampa Bay to take over and run out the clock.<ref>http://www.bucsnation.com/2012/7/18/3152229/great-games-in-bucs-history-1979-divisional-playoffs-tampa-bay-24</ref>\n\n===December 30, 1979===\n====AFC: Pittsburgh Steelers 34, Miami Dolphins 14====\n{{Americanfootballbox | titlestyle=text-align:center; background:#eee\n| title=Game summary|\n|Road=Dolphins\n|R1=0\n|R2=0\n|R3=7\n|R4=7\n|RT=14\n|Home='''Steelers'''\n|H1=20\n|H2=0\n|H3=7\n|H4=7\n|HT=34\n|stadium= [[Three Rivers Stadium]], [[Pittsburgh]]\n|time= 12:30 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EST]]\n|TV=[[NFL on NBC|NBC]]\n|TVAnnouncers=[[Don Criqui]] and [[John Brodie]]\n|attendance=50,214\n|referee=[[Cal Lepore]]\n|scoring=\n*'''Scoring'''\n**PIT \u2013 Thornton 1 run (Bahr kick) PIT 7\u20130\n**PIT \u2013 Stallworth 17 pass from Bradshaw (kick blocked) PIT 13\u20130\n**PIT \u2013 Swann 20 pass from Bradshaw (Bahr kick) PIT 20\u20130\n**MIA \u2013 D.

Miami future hall of fame running back [[Larry Csonka]] was held to just 20 rushing yards on 10 carries in the final game of his career, while Steelers quarterback [[Terry Bradshaw]] threw for 230 yards and 2 touchdowns. \n\nOn the opening drive of the game, Pittsburgh marched 62 yards in 13 plays to score on running back [[Sidney Thornton]]'s 1-yard touchdown run. On their second possession, the Steelers advanced another 62 yards in 9 plays, 36 of them on carries by Thornton, to score on wide receiver [[John Stallworth]]'s 17-yard touchdown reception (although the extra point was blocked). And on their third drive, they moved the ball 56 yards to score on wide receiver [[Lynn Swann]]'s 20-yard touchdown reception.  \n\nIn the second quarter, the Dolphins moved the ball 63 yards to the Pittsburgh 6-yard line, but then lost it when a safety blitz by [[J. T. Thomas (defensive back)|J. T. Thomas]] forced quarterback [[Bob Griese]] to throw a rushed pass that was intercepted by linebacker [[Dennis Winston]].  Miami soon got another chance to score when [[Larry Gordon]] recovered Thornton's fumble on the Steelers 5, but all this resulted in was a turnover on downs.  Faced with 4th and 2, Griese tried to connect with tight end [[Bruce Hardy]] in the end zone, but Hardy collided with receiver [[Nat Moore]] and the pass fell incomplete. The Steelers had a chance to increase their lead even more right before halftime when they tackled Dolphins punter [[George Roberts (American football)|George Roberts]] on the Miami 21 before he could make a kick.  But [[Matt Bahr]]'s 30-yard field goal was eliminated by a Pittsburgh holding penalty, which ran off the final seconds of the half.\n\nIn the second half, Pittsburgh primarily relied on their rushing game to protect their lead.  Despite Miami having the second highest ranked run defense during the season, and an injury that sidelined Thornton in the second half, the Steelers ended up running the ball 40 times during the game, with [[Franco Harris]] gaining 83 yards on 21 carries. Miami finally scored in the third quarter after defensive back Don Bessillieu recovered a punt that bounced into the leg of Pittsburgh blocker Dwayne Woodruff on the Steelers 11-yard line, leading to Griese's 7-yard touchdown pass to [[Duriel Harris]]. However, the Steelers responded by advancing 69 yards to score on running back [[Rocky Bleier]]'s 1-yard touchdown. Harris' 5-yard touchdown in the fourth quarter put the game out of reach.\n\nThis was the final NFL game for Csonka, as well as the final playoff game for Griese, who completed just 14 of 26 passes for 118 yards and was sacked 8 times before being replaced by [[Don Strock]] with 8:55 left in the fourth quarter.  Strock actually ended up with more passing yards, going 8/14 for 125 yards and leading the team 76 yards to their final score on a 1-yard Csonka run.\n\n====NFC: Los Angeles Rams 21, Dallas Cowboys 19====\n{{Americanfootballbox | titlestyle=text-align:center; background:#eee\n| title=Game summary|\n|Road='''Rams'''\n|R1=0\n|R2=14\n|R3=0\n|R4=7\n|RT=21\n|Home=Cowboys\n|H1=2\n|H2=3\n|H3=7\n|H4=7\n|HT=19\n|stadium= [[Texas Stadium]], [[Irving, Texas]]\n|time= 4:00 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EST]]\n|TV=[[NFL on CBS|CBS]]\n|TVAnnouncers=[[Vin Scully]] and [[George Allen (coach)|George Allen]]\n|attendance= 64,792\n|referee= [[Jerry Markbreit]]\n|scoring=\n*'''Scoring'''\n**DAL \u2013 Safety, R.

Dallas came into this game after an impressive win against the [[Washington Redskins]] in the last game of the regular season in which quarterback [[Roger Staubach]], already famous for his fourth quarter comebacks, added one more to his resume by rallying the Cowboys back from a 34\u201321 fourth quarter deficit to a 35\u201334 win.  But this day belonged to the Rams as quarterback [[Vince Ferragamo]] led them to a victory by throwing for three touchdown passes, the last one with 2:06 left in the game.\n\nThe game started out as a defensive struggle with Dallas punting on their first three drives and Los Angeles punting on their first two.  On the Rams third possession, they started out on their own 12-yard line and a penalty pushed them back 5 yards to the 7.  On second, Ferragamo dropped back into the end zone, scrambled forward, then tripped and fell over his own feet still in the end zone, where [[Randy White (American football)|Randy White]] fell on him for a safety, giving Dallas a 2\u20130 lead.  The Cowboys started their next drive with great field position on their own 46-yard line after the free kick, but two plays later, quarterback Staubach's pass was intercepted by defensive back [[Eddie Brown (safety)|Eddie Brown]] and returned 21 yards to the Dallas 32.  The Rams also proved unable to take advantage of good field position, as their ensuing drive ended with a missed 44-yard field goal attempt by [[Frank Corral]].\n\nThe second quarter began with more punting from both teams, but eventually the Rams offense managed to get on track, driving 93 yards to score on Ferragamo's 32-yard touchdown pass to running back [[Wendell Tyler]], making the score 7\u20132.  Dallas struck back with Staubach completing a 17-yard pass to [[Drew Pearson (American football)|Drew Pearson]] and a 16-yarder to tight end [[Billy Joe Dupree]], moving the ball close enough for Rafael Septien to kick a 33-yard field goal and cut the score to 7\u20135.  As time was running out in the half, Ferragamo managed to get the Rams to the Cowboys 43-yard line.  Just 11 seconds before halftime he fired a pass to [[Ron Smith (wide receiver)|Ron Smith]] in the end zone just before being leveled by White.  Smith made a leaping catch between two defenders for a touchdown, giving the Rams a 14\u20135 lead going into halftime.\n\nCowboys DB [[Dennis Thurman]] gave his team an early second half scoring opportunity, intercepting Ferragamo on the Rams opening drive and returning the ball 18 yards to the Los Angeles 32-yard line.  But their offense could not move the ball and ended up with a punt.  Once again the \"Doomsday Defense\" kept the Rams in check, and after a Los Angeles punt, Dallas took the ball back on their own 46.  On the next play, Staubach threw to Pearson for a 29-yard gain.  Then from the Los Angeles 25, they tried a [[halfback option play]].  It seemed to work at first, with running back [[Ron Springs]] throwing a touchdown pass to [[Tony Hill (American football)|Tony Hill]], but officials ruled he didn't have both feet in bounds before stepping out of the back of the end zone.  Then Staubach missed on a pass to [[Tony Dorsett]] in the end zone.  However, the Rams were flagged for pass interference, moving the ball to the 1-yard line, and Springs ran the ball in for a score on the next play, cutting the score to 14\u201312.  Dallas' situation got even better from there as safety [[Cliff Harris]] intercepted a pass from Ferragamo and returned it 22 yards to his 43-yard line.\n\nAfter the turnover, Dallas scored on Stabuach's 2-yard touchdown toss to tight end [[Jay Saldi]], giving the team a 19\u201314 lead with 12:46 left in regulation.  Both teams had some success moving on the ball on the next few drives, but failed to score on each one.  The Rams responded with a drive to the Cowboys 32-yard line, but turned the ball over on downs while trying to convert a 4th and 8.  On Dallas' first play after that, [[Tony Dorsett]] ran the ball 26 yards to the Rams 42.  But Dallas could go no further and ended up punting.  Then Ferragamo connected with [[Billy Waddy]] for a 36-yard completion on the Cowboys 44, only to have a holding penalty two plays later push them back into their own territory and end punting again.\n\nDallas took the ball back on their own 21 with 2:45 left, needing only to run out the clock to win the game.  On first down, [[Robert Newhouse]] was dropped for a 1-yard loss.  Then they tried a screen pass to Hill, but only gained 1-yard.  On a third down pass play, Staubach tried to scramble, but was stuffed for no gain and a punt followed.  The Rams had used all their timeouts on the possession, but got the ball back at midfield with 2:16 left in the game.  On their first play, Ferragamo threw a pass over the middle to Waddy, who caught the ball at the 28 and took off to the end zone to give the Rams a 21\u201319 lead.\n\nAlthough Dorsett rushed for 12 yards on the first play of the Cowboys' ensuing possession, Staubach was unable to engineer a late fourth-quarter comeback like the ones that made him famous throughout his career. After two incompletions, the Rams defense pressured the Dallas quarterback to throw a pass illegally to an ineligible receiver, guard [[Herbert Scott]], on third down, the last pass of his career to be caught.  On fourth down, he overthrew Drew Pearson.  The Rams got the ball back on the Cowboys 33 with 1:07 left.  Dallas had enough timeouts left to force the Rams into a fourth down situation with just 13 seconds left to go.  However, Rams defensive back [[Nolan Cromwell]], who was the holder on special teams, ran 7 yards for a first down on a fake field goal play as time expired in the game.<ref>http://lonestarstruck.com/2013/09/28/dallas-cowboys-1979-flashback-roger-and-out/</ref>\n\nFerragamo completed only 9 of 21 passes and was intercepted twice, but still threw for 210 yards and three touchdowns.  Staubach fared no better, finishing his final game 12/28 for 124 yards, with one touchdown and one interception.  Tyler rushed for 82 yards and caught two passes for 40.  Waddy caught 3 passes for 97 yards and a score, and had a 3-yard carry.  Dorsett rushed for 87 yards.\n\n==Conference championships==\n\n===January 6, 1980===\n\n====AFC Championship: Pittsburgh Steelers 27, Houston Oilers 13====\n{{Americanfootballbox | titlestyle=text-align:center; background:#eee\n| title=Game summary|\n|Road=Oilers\n|R1=7\n|R2=3\n|R3=0\n|R4=3\n|RT=13\n|Home='''Steelers'''\n|H1=3\n|H2=14\n|H3=0\n|H4=10\n|HT=27\n|stadium= [[Three Rivers Stadium]], [[Pittsburgh]]\n|time= 1:00 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EST]]\n|weather= {{convert|26|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}}, cloudy\n|TV=[[NFL on NBC|NBC]]\n|TVAnnouncers=[[Dick Enberg]] and [[Merlin Olsen]]\n|attendance= 50,475\n|referee= [[Jim Tunney (American football official)|Jim Tunney]]\n|scoring=\n*'''Scoring'''\n**HOU \u2013 Perry 75 interception return (Fritsch kick) HOU 7\u20130\n**PIT \u2013 field goal Bahr 21 HOU 7\u20133\n**HOU \u2013 field goal Fritsch 27 HOU 10\u20133\n**PIT \u2013 Cunningham 16 pass from Bradshaw (Bahr kick) 10\u201310\n**PIT \u2013 Stallworth 20 pass from Bradshaw (Bahr kick) PIT 17\u201310\n**HOU \u2013 field goal Fritsch 23 PIT 17\u201313\n**PIT \u2013 field goal Bahr 39 PIT 20\u201313\n**PIT \u2013 Bleier 4 run (Bahr kick) PIT 27\u201313\n}}\nThe Steelers held the Oilers to only 24 rushing yards, but were also aided by a controversial non-touchdown call to come away with a 27\u201313 win. Houston jumped to a 7\u20130 lead with just 2:30 into the game when [[Vernon Perry]] returned an interception 75 yards for a touchdown. Then after the teams exchanged field goals, Pittsburgh quarterback [[Terry Bradshaw]] completed two touchdown passes, a 16-yarder to tight end [[Bennie Cunningham]] and a 20-yard one to wide receiver [[John Stallworth]].\n\nWith the Steelers leading 17\u201310, the controversial play occurred during the last seconds of the third quarter after the Oilers advanced to the Pittsburgh 6-yard line. With a chance to tie the game, Quarterback [[Dan Pastorini]] threw a pass to [[Mike Renfro]] at the back of the end zone, and Renfro appeared to have caught it for a touchdown with both feet in bounds before he fell out of the end zone. TV replays suggested a catch for a touchdown. Despite this, the officials ruled the pass incomplete, saying that Renfro did not have complete control of the ball before going out of bounds. The Oilers then had to settle for a 23-yard field goal.\n<ref>https://newspaperarchive.com/indiana-gazette/1980-01-08/page-12</ref>\nThe Steelers would then score 10 unanswered points in the fourth quarter to clinch the victory. A 78-yard drive ended with a field goal and running back [[Rocky Bleier]] scored on a 4-yard rushing touchdown. Steelers running back [[Franco Harris]] rushed for 85 yards and caught 6 passes for 50 yards.

Los Angeles was able to record 369 yards of total offense, while running backs [[Cullen Bryant]] and [[Wendell Tyler]] rushed for 106 and 86 yards, respectively. Meanwhile, the Buccaneers only had 177 total offensive yards, including 92 rushing yards and 85 passing yards.  Tampa Bay starting quarterback [[Doug Williams (quarterback)|Doug Williams]] completed just 2 of 13 passes before suffering a game-ending torn bicep injury. Most of Tampa Bay's passing yards came from a 42-yard [[halfback option pass]] from [[Jerry Eckwood]] to wide receiver [[Larry Mucker]] in the fourth quarter. During the game, two touchdowns were nullified by penalties, one by each team: a four-yard run by Bryant and a 27-yard reception by Buccaneers' tight end [[Jimmie Giles]].\n\nOn their second drive of the game, LA drove to the Bucs 18-yard line, but Tyler lost a fumble due to a hit by [[Wally Chambers]] and linebacker [[Richard Wood (American football)|Richard Wood]] recovered it.  On their next drive, they drove 68 yards, including a 35-yard completion from [[Vince Ferragamo]] to [[Preston Dennard]], to the Buccaneers 1-yard line where Corral made a 19-yard field goal.  In the second quarter, they drove 58 yards and scored another short Corral field goal to take a 6\u20130 halftime lead.  In the third quarter, the Rams appeared to score on a 20-yard pass, but the reception was ruled incomplete and Corral missed a 37-yard field goal on the next play.

In his first career playoff game, Chargers future hall of fame quarterback [[Dan Fouts]] threw for 333 yards, but was intercepted 5 times. The Chargers' high powered offense scored on their first possession of the game and of the second half but turnovers prevented further scoring.\n\n[[File:1986 Jeno's Pizza - 44 - Elvin Bethea and Carter Hartwig (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|Houston's defensive line blocking a San Diego rushing attempt during the 1979 AFC Divisional Playoff Game.]]\nSan Diego took the opening kickoff and started out strong, moving the ball 81 yards in 11 plays.  Fouts completed a 34-yard pass to tight end [[Greg McCrary]] and a 17-yarder to [[John Jefferson]] before [[Clarence Williams (running back born 1955)|Clarence Williams]]' 1-yard rushing touchdown finished the drive.

On San Diego's next drive, Perry recorded another interception and lateralled the ball to safety [[Mike Reinfeldt]], who gained 7 yards to the Chargers 38. Three plays later, Oilers quarterback [[Gifford Nielsen]] rushed 14 yards to the Chargers 4-yard line.  San Diego's defense managed to keep them out of the end zone for three plays, but on Fritch's field goal attempt, they were penalized for having 12 men on the field, moving the ball just inches away from the goal line.  On fourth and inches with 19 seconds left in the half, Houston coach [[Bum Phillips]] decided to gamble and go for the touchdown, a gamble that paid off when [[Boobie Clark]] scored on a sweep left to give the Oilers a 10\u20137 first half lead.\n\nIn the third period, Fouts connected with [[Charlie Joiner]] for 20 yards and hit tight end [[Bob Klein]] for 16, with a roughing the passer penalty turning it into a 31-yard gain. [[Lydell Mitchell]] finished the 65-yard drive with an 8-yard touchdown run to give the Chargers a 14\u201310 lead. However, Houston defensive back [[J.C. Wilson]]'s interception later gave Houston the ball at the San Diego 44-yard line.  Faced with 3rd and 13 two plays later, Nielsen threw a 47-yard touchdown pass to receiver [[Mike Renfro]], putting the Oilers back in front at 17\u201314.  There were still more than 17 minutes left in regulation, but this would be the final score. Perry recorded two more interceptions as the Oilers defense shut down the Chargers offense for the rest of the game.<ref>http://fs64sports.blogspot.com/2010_12_29_archive.html</ref><ref>https://www.pro-football-reference.com/boxscores/197912290sdg.htm</ref>\n\nAfter the game, it was revealed that the Oilers coaching staff was able to figure out the Chargers' coaches' signs as they signaled the play call from the sideline; this was one reason their defensive backs seemed to always be in the right place at the right time. \"We pretty much knew ahead of time when they were going to pass, and where they were going to pass it.\" said Oilers defensive coordinator [[Ed Biles]]. It was a monumental upset against the heavily favored Chargers, who had scored at least 26 points in 10 games during the season and had defeated both eventual Super Bowl teams, the Rams and Steelers, by a combined scoring margin of 75-23.\n\nIt was the first AFC playoff game that was a rematch of an earlier AFL championship game.\n\n====NFC: Tampa Bay Buccaneers 24, Philadelphia Eagles 17====\n{{Americanfootballbox | titlestyle=text-align:center; background:#eee\n| title=Game summary|\n|Road=Eagles\n|R1=0\n|R2=7\n|R3=3\n|R4=7\n|RT=17\n|Home='''Buccaneers'''\n|H1=7\n|H2=10\n|H3=0\n|H4=7\n|HT=24\n|stadium= [[Tampa Stadium]], [[Tampa, Florida]]\n|time= 12:30 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EST]]\n|weather= {{convert|73|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}}, scattered clouds\n|TV=[[NFL on CBS|CBS]]\n|TVAnnouncers= [[Curt Gowdy]] and [[Hank Stram]]\n|attendance= 71,402\n|referee= [[Fred Silva]]\n|scoring=\n*'''Scoring'''\n**TB \u2013 Bell 4 run (O'Donoghue kick) TB 7\u20130\n**TB \u2013 field goal O'Donoghue 40 TB 10\u20130\n**TB \u2013 Bell 1 run (O'Donoghue kick) TB 17\u20130\n**PHI \u2013 Smith 11 pass from Jaworski (Franklin kick) TB 17\u20137\n**PHI \u2013 field goal Franklin 42 17\u201310\n**TB \u2013 Giles 9 pass from Williams (O'Donoghue kick) TB 24\u201310\n**PHI \u2013 Carmichael 37 pass from Jaworski (Franklin kick) TB 24\u201317\n}}\n[[File:1986 Jeno's Pizza - 20 - Cecil Johnson (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|The Buccaneers stopping an Eagles rushing play during the 1979 NFC Divisional Playoff Game.]]\nThe Buccaneers won their first playoff game in team history by jumping to a 17\u20130 lead and holding the Eagles to 48 rushing yards, while running back [[Ricky Bell (running back)|Ricky Bell]] recorded 142 rushing yards and 2 touchdowns.\n\n[[File:1986 Jeno's Pizza - 19 - Ricky Bell crop.jpg|thumb|left|Buccaneers' running back Ricky Bell rushing the ball during the Divisional Playoff Game.]]\nTampa Bay marched on an 18-play, 80-yard opening drive that took 9:25 off the clock to score on Bell's 4-yard touchdown run.  Philadelphia responded with a drive into scoring range, but their drive ended ugly.  First they attempted a fake 47-yard field goal, but they failed to snap the ball before the play clock ran out.  Then [[Tony Franklin (kicker)|Tony Franklin]]'s 52-yard field goal was no good.  Tampa Bay took the ball back and drove to a 10\u20130 lead on Neil O'Donohue's 40-yard field goal.  Then on the Eagles next drive, running back [[Wilbert Montgomery]] lost a fumble that nose tackle [[Randy Crowder]] recovered on the Philadelphia 5-yard line.  Three plays later, Bell scored on a 1-yard fourth down run, increasing the Bucs lead to 17\u20130 with 5:12 left in the half.  Later on, Eagles linebacker [[Jerry Robinson (linebacker)|Jerry Robinson]] intercepted a pass from [[Doug Williams (quarterback)|Doug Williams]] and returned it 37 yards to set up [[Ron Jaworski]]'s 11-yard touchdown pass to [[Charlie Smith (wide receiver)|Charlie Smith]], making the score 17\u20137 by halftime.\n\nPhiladelphia took the second half kickoff and drove 45 yards to score on Franklin's 42-yard field goal, cutting the deficit to 17\u201310.  This would be the last score until 7:08 remained in the game, when Williams threw a 9-yard touchdown pass to [[Jimmie Giles]].  Now down 24\u201310, Philadelphia made a desperate comeback attempt.  First they drove 80 yards in 9 plays and scored on Jaworski's 37-yard bomb to [[Harold Carmichael]].  Their defense then forced a punt with 2:11 left in the game, giving them one last chance for a tying touchdown.  Jaworski's completions to Carmichael and Smith for gains of 16 and 25 yards moved the ball to the Bucs 45-yard line.  But his next four passes were incomplete, enabling Tampa Bay to take over and run out the clock.<ref>http://www.bucsnation.com/2012/7/18/3152229/great-games-in-bucs-history-1979-divisional-playoffs-tampa-bay-24</ref>\n\n===December 30, 1979===\n====AFC: Pittsburgh Steelers 34, Miami Dolphins 14====\n{{Americanfootballbox | titlestyle=text-align:center; background:#eee\n| title=Game summary|\n|Road=Dolphins\n|R1=0\n|R2=0\n|R3=7\n|R4=7\n|RT=14\n|Home='''Steelers'''\n|H1=20\n|H2=0\n|H3=7\n|H4=7\n|HT=34\n|stadium= [[Three Rivers Stadium]], [[Pittsburgh]]\n|time= 12:30 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EST]]\n|TV=[[NFL on NBC|NBC]]\n|TVAnnouncers=[[Don Criqui]] and [[John Brodie]]\n|attendance=50,214\n|referee=[[Cal Lepore]]\n|scoring=\n*'''Scoring'''\n**PIT \u2013 Thornton 1 run (Bahr kick) PIT 7\u20130\n**PIT \u2013 Stallworth 17 pass from Bradshaw (kick blocked) PIT 13\u20130\n**PIT \u2013 Swann 20 pass from Bradshaw (Bahr kick) PIT 20\u20130\n**MIA \u2013 D.

Miami future hall of fame running back [[Larry Csonka]] was held to just 20 rushing yards on 10 carries in the final game of his career, while Steelers quarterback [[Terry Bradshaw]] threw for 230 yards and 2 touchdowns. \n\nOn the opening drive of the game, Pittsburgh marched 62 yards in 13 plays to score on running back [[Sidney Thornton]]'s 1-yard touchdown run. On their second possession, the Steelers advanced another 62 yards in 9 plays, 36 of them on carries by Thornton, to score on wide receiver [[John Stallworth]]'s 17-yard touchdown reception (although the extra point was blocked). And on their third drive, they moved the ball 56 yards to score on wide receiver [[Lynn Swann]]'s 20-yard touchdown reception.  \n\nIn the second quarter, the Dolphins moved the ball 63 yards to the Pittsburgh 6-yard line, but then lost it when a safety blitz by [[J. T. Thomas (defensive back)|J. T. Thomas]] forced quarterback [[Bob Griese]] to throw a rushed pass that was intercepted by linebacker [[Dennis Winston]].  Miami soon got another chance to score when [[Larry Gordon]] recovered Thornton's fumble on the Steelers 5, but all this resulted in was a turnover on downs.  Faced with 4th and 2, Griese tried to connect with tight end [[Bruce Hardy]] in the end zone, but Hardy collided with receiver [[Nat Moore]] and the pass fell incomplete. The Steelers had a chance to increase their lead even more right before halftime when they tackled Dolphins punter [[George Roberts (American football)|George Roberts]] on the Miami 21 before he could make a kick.  But [[Matt Bahr]]'s 30-yard field goal was eliminated by a Pittsburgh holding penalty, which ran off the final seconds of the half.\n\nIn the second half, Pittsburgh primarily relied on their rushing game to protect their lead.  Despite Miami having the second highest ranked run defense during the season, and an injury that sidelined Thornton in the second half, the Steelers ended up running the ball 40 times during the game, with [[Franco Harris]] gaining 83 yards on 21 carries. Miami finally scored in the third quarter after defensive back Don Bessillieu recovered a punt that bounced into the leg of Pittsburgh blocker Dwayne Woodruff on the Steelers 11-yard line, leading to Griese's 7-yard touchdown pass to [[Duriel Harris]]. However, the Steelers responded by advancing 69 yards to score on running back [[Rocky Bleier]]'s 1-yard touchdown. Harris' 5-yard touchdown in the fourth quarter put the game out of reach.\n\nThis was the final NFL game for Csonka, as well as the final playoff game for Griese, who completed just 14 of 26 passes for 118 yards and was sacked 8 times before being replaced by [[Don Strock]] with 8:55 left in the fourth quarter.  Strock actually ended up with more passing yards, going 8/14 for 125 yards and leading the team 76 yards to their final score on a 1-yard Csonka run.\n\n====NFC: Los Angeles Rams 21, Dallas Cowboys 19====\n{{Americanfootballbox | titlestyle=text-align:center; background:#eee\n| title=Game summary|\n|Road='''Rams'''\n|R1=0\n|R2=14\n|R3=0\n|R4=7\n|RT=21\n|Home=Cowboys\n|H1=2\n|H2=3\n|H3=7\n|H4=7\n|HT=19\n|stadium= [[Texas Stadium]], [[Irving, Texas]]\n|time= 4:00 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EST]]\n|TV=[[NFL on CBS|CBS]]\n|TVAnnouncers=[[Vin Scully]] and [[George Allen (coach)|George Allen]]\n|attendance= 64,792\n|referee= [[Jerry Markbreit]]\n|scoring=\n*'''Scoring'''\n**DAL \u2013 Safety, R.

Dallas came into this game after an impressive win against the [[Washington Redskins]] in the last game of the regular season in which quarterback [[Roger Staubach]], already famous for his fourth quarter comebacks, added one more to his resume by rallying the Cowboys back from a 34\u201321 fourth quarter deficit to a 35\u201334 win.  But this day belonged to the Rams as quarterback [[Vince Ferragamo]] led them to a victory by throwing for three touchdown passes, the last one with 2:06 left in the game.\n\nThe game started out as a defensive struggle with Dallas punting on their first three drives and Los Angeles punting on their first two.  On the Rams third possession, they started out on their own 12-yard line and a penalty pushed them back 5 yards to the 7.  On second, Ferragamo dropped back into the end zone, scrambled forward, then tripped and fell over his own feet still in the end zone, where [[Randy White]] fell on him for a safety, giving Dallas a 2\u20130 lead.  The Cowboys started their next drive with great field position on their own 46-yard line after the free kick, but two plays later, quarterback Staubach's pass was intercepted by defensive back [[Eddie Brown (safety)|Eddie Brown]] and returned 21 yards to the Dallas 32.  The Rams also proved unable to take advantage of good field position, as their ensuing drive ended with a missed 44-yard field goal attempt by [[Frank Corral]].\n\nThe second quarter began with more punting from both teams, but eventually the Rams offense managed to get on track, driving 93 yards to score on Ferragamo's 32-yard touchdown pass to running back [[Wendell Tyler]], making the score 7\u20132.  Dallas struck back with Staubach completing a 17-yard pass to [[Drew Pearson (American football)|Drew Pearson]] and a 16-yarder to tight end [[Billy Joe Dupree]], moving the ball close enough for Rafael Septien to kick a 33-yard field goal and cut the score to 7\u20135.  As time was running out in the half, Ferragamo managed to get the Rams to the Cowboys 43-yard line.  Just 11 seconds before halftime he fired a pass to [[Ron Smith (wide receiver)|Ron Smith]] in the end zone just before being leveled by White.  Smith made a leaping catch between two defenders for a touchdown, giving the Rams a 14\u20135 lead going into halftime.\n\nCowboys DB [[Dennis Thurman]] gave his team an early second half scoring opportunity, intercepting Ferragamo on the Rams opening drive and returning the ball 18 yards to the Los Angeles 32-yard line.  But their offense could not move the ball and ended up with a punt.  Once again the \"Doomsday Defense\" kept the Rams in check, and after a Los Angeles punt, Dallas took the ball back on their own 46.  On the next play, Staubach threw to Pearson for a 29-yard gain.  Then from the Los Angeles 25, they tried a [[halfback option play]].  It seemed to work at first, with running back [[Ron Springs]] throwing a touchdown pass to [[Tony Hill (American football)|Tony Hill]], but officials ruled he didn't have both feet in bounds before stepping out of the back of the end zone.  Then Staubach missed on a pass to [[Tony Dorsett]] in the end zone.  However, the Rams were flagged for pass interference, moving the ball to the 1-yard line, and Springs ran the ball in for a score on the next play, cutting the score to 14\u201312.  Dallas' situation got even better from there as safety [[Cliff Harris]] intercepted a pass from Ferragamo and returned it 22 yards to his 43-yard line.\n\nAfter the turnover, Dallas scored on Stabuach's 2-yard touchdown toss to tight end [[Jay Saldi]], giving the team a 19\u201314 lead with 12:46 left in regulation.  Both teams had some success moving on the ball on the next few drives, but failed to score on each one.  The Rams responded with a drive to the Cowboys 32-yard line, but turned the ball over on downs while trying to convert a 4th and 8.  On Dallas' first play after that, [[Tony Dorsett]] ran the ball 26 yards to the Rams 42.  But Dallas could go no further and ended up punting.  Then Ferragamo connected with [[Billy Waddy]] for a 36-yard completion on the Cowboys 44, only to have a holding penalty two plays later push them back into their own territory and end punting again.\n\nDallas took the ball back on their own 21 with 2:45 left, needing only to run out the clock to win the game.  On first down, [[Robert Newhouse]] was dropped for a 1-yard loss.  Then they tried a screen pass to Hill, but only gained 1-yard.  On a third down pass play, Staubach tried to scramble, but was stuffed for no gain and a punt followed.  The Rams had used all their timeouts on the possession, but got the ball back at midfield with 2:16 left in the game.  On their first play, Ferragamo threw a pass over the middle to Waddy, who caught the ball at the 28 and took off to the end zone to give the Rams a 21\u201319 lead.\n\nAlthough Dorsett rushed for 12 yards on the first play of the Cowboys' ensuing possession, Staubach was unable to engineer a late fourth-quarter comeback like the ones that made him famous throughout his career. After two incompletions, the Rams defense pressured the Dallas quarterback to throw a pass illegally to an ineligible receiver, guard [[Herbert Scott]], on third down, the last pass of his career to be caught.  On fourth down, he overthrew Drew Pearson.  The Rams got the ball back on the Cowboys 33 with 1:07 left.  Dallas had enough timeouts left to force the Rams into a fourth down situation with just 13 seconds left to go.  However, Rams defensive back [[Nolan Cromwell]], who was the holder on special teams, ran 7 yards for a first down on a fake field goal play as time expired in the game.<ref>http://lonestarstruck.com/2013/09/28/dallas-cowboys-1979-flashback-roger-and-out/</ref>\n\nFerragamo completed only 9 of 21 passes and was intercepted twice, but still threw for 210 yards and three touchdowns.  Staubach fared no better, finishing his final game 12/28 for 124 yards, with one touchdown and one interception.  Tyler rushed for 82 yards and caught two passes for 40.  Waddy caught 3 passes for 97 yards and a score, and had a 3-yard carry.  Dorsett rushed for 87 yards.\n\n==Conference championships==\n\n===January 6, 1980===\n\n====AFC Championship: Pittsburgh Steelers 27, Houston Oilers 13====\n{{Americanfootballbox | titlestyle=text-align:center; background:#eee\n| title=Game summary|\n|Road=Oilers\n|R1=7\n|R2=3\n|R3=0\n|R4=3\n|RT=13\n|Home='''Steelers'''\n|H1=3\n|H2=14\n|H3=0\n|H4=10\n|HT=27\n|stadium= [[Three Rivers Stadium]], [[Pittsburgh]]\n|time= 1:00 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EST]]\n|weather= {{convert|26|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}}, cloudy\n|TV=[[NFL on NBC|NBC]]\n|TVAnnouncers=[[Dick Enberg]] and [[Merlin Olsen]]\n|attendance= 50,475\n|referee= [[Jim Tunney (American football official)|Jim Tunney]]\n|scoring=\n*'''Scoring'''\n**HOU \u2013 Perry 75 interception return (Fritsch kick) HOU 7\u20130\n**PIT \u2013 field goal Bahr 21 HOU 7\u20133\n**HOU \u2013 field goal Fritsch 27 HOU 10\u20133\n**PIT \u2013 Cunningham 16 pass from Bradshaw (Bahr kick) 10\u201310\n**PIT \u2013 Stallworth 20 pass from Bradshaw (Bahr kick) PIT 17\u201310\n**HOU \u2013 field goal Fritsch 23 PIT 17\u201313\n**PIT \u2013 field goal Bahr 39 PIT 20\u201313\n**PIT \u2013 Bleier 4 run (Bahr kick) PIT 27\u201313\n}}\nThe Steelers held the Oilers to only 24 rushing yards, but were also aided by a controversial non-touchdown call to come away with a 27\u201313 win. Houston jumped to a 7\u20130 lead with just 2:30 into the game when [[Vernon Perry]] returned an interception 75 yards for a touchdown. Then after the teams exchanged field goals, Pittsburgh quarterback [[Terry Bradshaw]] completed two touchdown passes, a 16-yarder to tight end [[Bennie Cunningham]] and a 20-yard one to wide receiver [[John Stallworth]].\n\nWith the Steelers leading 17\u201310, the controversial play occurred during the last seconds of the third quarter after the Oilers advanced to the Pittsburgh 6-yard line. With a chance to tie the game, Quarterback [[Dan Pastorini]] threw a pass to [[Mike Renfro]] at the back of the end zone, and Renfro appeared to have caught it for a touchdown with both feet in bounds before he fell out of the end zone. TV replays suggested a catch for a touchdown. Despite this, the officials ruled the pass incomplete, saying that Renfro did not have complete control of the ball before going out of bounds. The Oilers then had to settle for a 23-yard field goal.\n<ref>https://newspaperarchive.com/indiana-gazette/1980-01-08/page-12</ref>\nThe Steelers would then score 10 unanswered points in the fourth quarter to clinch the victory. A 78-yard drive ended with a field goal and running back [[Rocky Bleier]] scored on a 4-yard rushing touchdown. Steelers running back [[Franco Harris]] rushed for 85 yards and caught 6 passes for 50 yards. Houston running back [[Earl Campbell]], the NFL's leading rusher during the season, finished the game with just 15 yards on 17 carries.\n\n====NFC Championship: Los Angeles Rams 9, Tampa Bay Buccaneers 0====\n{{Americanfootballbox | titlestyle=text-align:center; background:#eee\n| title=Game summary|\n|Road='''Rams'''\n|R1=0\n|R2=6\n|R3=0\n|R4=3\n|RT=9\n|Home=Buccaneers\n|H1=0\n|H2=0\n|H3=0\n|H4=0\n|HT=0\n|stadium= [[Tampa Stadium]], [[Tampa, Florida]]\n|time= 5:00 p.m. [[Eastern Time Zone|EST]]\n|weather= {{convert|54|\u00b0F|\u00b0C}}, clear\n|TV=[[NFL on CBS|CBS]]\n|TVAnnouncers= [[Pat Summerall]] and [[Tom Brookshier]]\n|attendance= 72,033\n|referee= [[Pat Haggerty (American football official)|Pat Haggerty]]\n|scoring=\n*'''Scoring'''\n**LA \u2013 field goal Corral 19 LA 3\u20130\n**LA \u2013 field goal Corral 21 LA 6\u20130\n**LA \u2013 field goal Corral 23 LA 9\u20130\n}}\nIn a defensive battle in which the Rams squandered numerous scoring opportunities, Rams kicker [[Frank Corral]] kicked 3 field goals to win the game. Los Angeles was able to record 369 yards of total offense, while running backs [[Cullen Bryant]] and [[Wendell Tyler]] rushed for 106 and 86 yards, respectively. Meanwhile, the Buccaneers only had 177 total offensive yards, including 92 rushing yards and 85 passing yards.  Tampa Bay starting quarterback [[Doug Williams (quarterback)|Doug Williams]] completed just 2 of 13 passes before suffering a game-ending torn bicep injury. Most of Tampa Bay's passing yards came from a 42-yard [[halfback option pass]] from [[Jerry Eckwood]] to wide receiver [[Larry Mucker]] in the fourth quarter. During the game, two touchdowns were nullified by penalties, one by each team: a four-yard run by Bryant and a 27-yard reception by Buccaneers' tight end [[Jimmie Giles]].\n\nOn their second drive of the game, LA drove to the Bucs 18-yard line, but Tyler lost a fumble due to a hit by [[Wally Chambers]] and linebacker [[Richard Wood (American football)|Richard Wood]] recovered it.  On their next drive, they drove 68 yards, including a 35-yard completion from [[Vince Ferragamo]] to [[Preston Dennard]], to the Buccaneers 1-yard line where Corral made a 19-yard field goal.  In the second quarter, they drove 58 yards and scored another short Corral field goal to take a 6\u20130 halftime lead.

They were nomadic hunter-gatherers who were constantly moving from place to place to find food sources, namely fruits, water and wild animals. Nowadays one can find San paintings inside rocky hills of the park.\n\nAt the beginning of the 20th century, the region that would become Botswana was divided into different land tenure systems. At that time, a major part of the park's area was classified as [[crown land]]. The idea of a [[national park]] to protect the varied wildlife found here as well as promote [[tourism]] first appeared in 1931. The following year, {{convert|24,000|km2|abbr=on}} around Chobe district were officially declared non-hunting area; this area was expanded to {{convert|31,600|km2|abbr=on}} two years later.\n\nIn 1943, heavy [[tsetse]] infestations occurred throughout the region, delaying the creation of the national park. By 1953, the project received governmental attention again: {{convert|21,000|km2|abbr=on}} were suggested to become a game reserve. Chobe Game Reserve was officially created in 1960, though smaller than initially desired. In 1967, the reserve was declared a national park.\n\nAt that time there were several industrial settlements in the region, especially at Serondela, where the [[timber industry]] proliferated. These settlements were gradually moved out of the park, and it was not until 1975 that the whole protected area was exempt from human activity. Nowadays traces of the prior timber industry are still visible at Serondela. Minor expansions of the park took place in 1980 and 1987.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}\n\n== Geography and ecosystems ==\nThe park can be divided up to 4 areas, each corresponding to one distinct [[ecosystem]]:\n* The Serondela area (or '''Chobe riverfront'''), situated in the extreme Northeast of the park, has as its main geographical features lush floodplains and dense woodland of [[mahogany]], [[teak]] and other hardwoods now largely reduced by heavy elephant pressure. The [[Chobe River]], which flows along the Northeast border of the park, is a major watering spot, especially in the dry season (May through October) for large breeding herds of [[elephant]]s, as well as families of [[giraffe]], sable and cape [[African Buffalo]]. The flood plains are the only place in Botswana where the puku [[antelope]] can be seen. Birding is also available. Large numbers of [[Southern carmine bee-eater|carmine bee eaters]] are spotted in season.  When in flood [[spoonbill]]s, [[ibis]], various [[species]] of [[stork]]s, [[duck]]s and other [[waterfowl]] flock to the area. This is likely Chobe's most visited section, in large part because of its proximity to the [[Victoria Falls, Zambia|Victoria Falls]]. The town of [[Kasane]], situated just downstream, is the most important town of the region and serves as the northern entrance to the park.\n* The Savuti Marsh area, {{convert|10,878|km2|abbr=on}} large, constitutes the western stretch of the park ({{convert|50|km|abbr=on}} north of Mababe Gate). The Savuti Marsh is the relic of a large inland [[lake]] whose water supply was cut a long time ago by [[Plate tectonics|tectonic movement]]s. Nowadays the marsh is fed by the erratic Savuti Channel, which dries up for long periods then curiously flows again, a consequence of tectonic activity in the area. It is currently flowing again and in January 2010 reached Savuti Marsh for the first time since 1982. As a result of this variable flow, there are hundred of dead trees along the channel's bank. The region is also covered with extensive [[savanna]]hs and rolling [[grassland]]s, which makes wildlife particularly dynamic in this section of the park. During [[dry season]]s, tourists going on [[safari]] often sight [[rhinoceros]], [[common warthog]], [[kudu]], [[impala]], [[zebra]], [[wildebeest]] and herds of [[African bush elephant]]. During [[rain season]]s, the rich [[birdlife]] of the park, 450 species in the whole park, is well represented. Prides of [[Panthera leo melanochaita|lion]]s, [[hyena]]s, [[zebra]]s or more rarely [[cheetah]]s are sighted as well. This region is reputed for its annual migration of zebras and [[predator]]s.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}\n* The '''Linyanti Marsh''', located at the northwest corner of the park and to the north of Savuti, is adjacent to the [[Linyanti River]]. To the west of this area lies Selinda Reserve and on the northern bank of [[Kwando River]] is [[Namibia]]'s [[Nkasa Rupara National Park]]. Around these two rivers are riverine woodlands, open woodlands as well as [[lagoon]]s, and the rest of the region mainly consists of flood plains. There are large concentrations of lion prides, [[African leopard]], [[African wild dog]], [[roan antelope]], [[sable antelope]], a [[hippopotamus]] pod and herds of African bush elephant. The rarer [[red lechwe]], [[sitatunga]] and a bask of [[Nile crocodile]]s also occur in the area. Bird diversity is rich.\n* Between Linyanti and Savuti Marshes lies a hot and dry '''hinterland''', mainly occupied by the Nogatsaa grass woodland.

Portland cement and granite chips. Arches and windows which had previously been bricked up were opened out again. A new roof was installed, reusing as much of the medieval carved oak as possible. Mr. Goodwin of the Lugwardine Works, Hereford provided encaustic tiles to pave the chancel. Mr Powell of Whitefriars carved a new reredos for the high altar. The old high backed pews were removed ready for new seating. The three entrances were supplied with new oak doors, and a new floor was laid in the belfry.

It was established in 1981 as \"[[Technikon]] Free State\". As part of the South African government's restructuring of tertiary education for the new millennium it was promoted to university of technology status.\n\n==About CUT==\nThe university (then still known as the \u201cTechnikon Free State\u201d) opened its doors in 1981, with 285 students enrolled in mainly secretarial, art and design programmes.  Today, the institution boasts more than 21 000 students who have decided to make CUT their academic partner in earning a qualification and gaining appropriate work-integrated learning to equip and prepare them for professional practice. With the restructuring of the higher education landscape in 2004, CUT embraced its new status as a university of technology (UoT), positioning itself to succeed as such.   The qualifications on offer reside in four faculties, namely Faculty of Health and Environmental Sciences; Faculty of Humanities; Faculty of Engineering, Built Environment and Information Technology (IT); and Faculty of Management Sciences.  The university offers certificates and diplomas at undergraduate level, as well as advanced diplomas, postgraduate diplomas at honours level, and master\u2019s and doctoral degrees in order to increase the production of world-class postgraduate programmes and high-quality outputs for research.\n\nCUT\u2019s vision is to be \u201can engaged university that focuses on producing quality social and technological innovations for socio-economic development, primarily in the Central region of South Africa\u201d. This vision has four pillars, namely planning, products, people and pennies, each describing an important aspect of the university\u2019s future. It does not come as a surprise, then, that Management, staff and students have formulated a strategic vision for the future that is all about heart. They call it the \u201cVision 2020 Statement\u201d, and within it are ideas and goals that are supported and inspired by the university across all platforms and programmes. It represents the university\u2019s aspirations and determination as a UoT, and has allowed the university to contribute substantively to addressing the developmental needs of the Free State, the Central region, South Africa and the continent.\n\nThe university\u2019s goal is to be a leader in areas of social and technological innovations and research. CUT believes that no successful geographical region has ever established a technology-based industry without a leading educational institution in its midst, and the university wants to become this institution. In this lies the strength of the planning pillar, which outlines the step-by-step implementation and review of the main practices and outcomes of Vision 2020.\n\n===Campuses===\nCUT is the foremost higher education institution in the heartland of South Africa.

It has the same shape as an [[apostrophe|apostrophe ( \u2019 )]]  or single closing [[quotation mark]] in many [[typeface]]s, but it differs from them in being placed on the baseline of the text. Some typefaces render it as a small line, slightly curved or straight but inclined from the vertical, or with the appearance of a small, filled-in {{not a typo|figure ''9''|reason=This is, very specifically, about the numeral/glyph/figure \"9\", not the word or concept \"nine\".}}.\n\n\nA comma-shaped mark is used as a [[diacritic]] in several writing systems, and is considered distinct from the [[cedilla]]. The [[rough breathing|rough]] and [[smooth breathing]]s ({{lang|grc|\u1f01, \u1f00}}) appear above the letter in [[Ancient Greek]], and the [[#Diacritical usage|comma diacritic]] appears below the letter in [[Latvian orthography|Latvian]], [[Romanian orthography|Romanian]], and [[Livonian orthography|Livonian]].\n\n==History==\n[[Punctuation]] is much more recent than the alphabet. \nIn the 3rd century BC, [[Aristophanes of Byzantium]] invented a system of single [[Interpunct|dots]] (''distinctiones'') that separated verses (colometry) and indicated the amount of breath needed to complete each fragment of the text when [[Reading (process)|reading]] aloud.<ref>{{cite book |title= Eats, Shoot & Leaves: The Zero Tolerance Approach to Punctuation|last= Truss|first= Lynn|year= 2004|publisher= Gotham Books|location= New York|isbn= 1-59240-087-6|page=72}}</ref>  The different lengths were signified by a dot at the bottom, middle, or top of the line.  For a short passage (a ''komma''), a ''media distinctio'' dot was placed mid-level (&nbsp;'''\u00b7'''&nbsp;).  This is the origin of the concept of a comma, although the name came to be used for the mark itself instead of the clause it separated.\n\nThe mark used today is descended from a diagonal [[slash (punctuation)|slash]], or ''virgula suspensiva'' (&nbsp;'''/'''&nbsp;), used from the 13th to 17th centuries to represent a pause. The modern comma was first used by [[Aldus Manutius]].<ref>[http://www.haverford.edu/classics/courses/2006S/lat101/handouts/no_spaces_aeneid.pdf Reading Before Punctuation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060902185038/http://www.haverford.edu/classics/courses/2006S/lat101/handouts/no_spaces_aeneid.pdf |date=September 2, 2006 }} \u2013 ''Introduction to Latin Literature'' pamphlet, [[Haverford College]]</ref><ref>[https://www.ualberta.ca/~sreimer/ms-course/course/punc.htm#mtop Manuscript Studies, Medieval and Early Modern] \u2013 [[Palaeography]]: Punctuation glossary</ref>\n\nMoreover, the mark is used to separate words, phrases and clauses in a sentence to help it to be understood: to divide a sentence into easily assimilated bite-sized pieces. However, there are many other functions of the comma, such as \"setting of questions\", \"emphasizing point of view\", and etc.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.grammarly.com/blog/comma/ |title = Rules for Comma Usage|date = 2016-02-16}}</ref>\n\n==Uses in English==\nIn general, the comma shows that the words immediately before the comma are less closely or exclusively linked [[grammar|grammatically]] to those immediately after the comma than they might be otherwise. The comma performs a number of functions in [[English language|English]] writing. It is used in generally similar ways in other languages, particularly European ones, although the rules on comma usage \u2013 and their rigidity \u2013 vary from language to language.\n\n===The serial comma===\nCommas are placed between items in lists, as in ''They own a cat, a dog, two rabbits, and seven mice.''\n\nWhether the final conjunction, most frequently ''and'', should be preceded by a comma, called the ''serial comma'', is one of the most disputed linguistic or stylistic questions in English.\n\n*They served apples, peaches, and bananas. (serial comma used)\n*We cleaned up cores, pits and skins. (serial comma omitted)\n\n====American usage====\nThe serial comma is used much more often, usually routinely, in the United States. A majority of American style guides mandate its use, including ''[[The Chicago Manual of Style]]'', [[William Strunk, Jr.|Strunk]] and [[E. B. White|White]]'s classic ''[[The Elements of Style]]'', and the ''[[U.S. Government Printing Office]] Style Manual''. The ''AP Stylebook'' for journalistic writing advises against it.{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n\n\nThe serial comma is also known as the Oxford comma, Harvard comma, or series comma. It is sometimes perceived as overly careful or an Americanism{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}, but its usage occurs within both American and British English.  It is called the Oxford comma because of its long history of use by Oxford University Press.<ref name=OxfordD>{{cite encyclopedia | title = What is the 'Oxford comma'? | encyclopedia = Oxford Dictionaries | publisher = Oxford University Press | accessdate = 2015-09-15 | url =http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/words/what-is-the-oxford-comma?q=oxford+comma}}</ref>\n\nIt is used less often in British English, but some British style guides require it, including the [[Oxford University Press]] style manual and [[Henry Watson Fowler|Fowler]]'s ''[[Modern English Usage]]''. Some writers of British English use it only where necessary to avoid ambiguity.\n\nAccording to ''New Hart's Rules'', \"house style will dictate\" whether to use the serial comma, and \"The general rule is that one style or the other should be used consistently.\"  No association with region or dialect is suggested, other than that its use has been strongly advocated by Oxford University Press.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ritter|first1=R. M.|title=New Hart's Rules|url=https://archive.org/details/newhartsrules00rmri|url-access=registration|date=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, UK|pages=[https://archive.org/details/newhartsrules00rmri/page/77 77], 300|edition=Second}}</ref>\n\n\nis more frequent in the United States than in England; in England it may be called an Oxford comma, because the [[Oxford University Press]], uniquely in England, recommends it. It is recommended by the United States [[Government Printing Office]], [[Harvard University Press]], and the classic ''Elements of Style'' of [[Strunk and White]].\n\nUse of a comma may prevent ambiguity:\n\n* The sentence ''I spoke to the boys, Sam and Tom'' could mean either ''I spoke to the boys and Sam and Tom'' (I spoke to more than three people) or ''I spoke to the boys, who are Sam and Tom'' (I spoke to two people);\n* ''I spoke to the boys, Sam, and Tom'' \u2013 must be ''the boys and Sam and Tom'' (I spoke to more than three people).\n\nThe serial comma does not eliminate all confusion. Consider the following sentence:\n*''I thank my mother, Anne Smith, and Thomas.'' This could mean either ''my mother and Anne Smith and Thomas'' (three people) or ''my mother, who is Anne Smith; and Thomas'' (two people). This sentence might be recast as \"my mother (Anne Smith) and Thomas\" for clarity.\n* ''I thank my mother, Anne Smith and Thomas.'' Because the comma after \"mother\" is conventionally used to prepare the reader for an [[apposition|apposite phrase]] \u2013 that is, a renaming of or further information about a noun \u2013 this construction suggests that my mother's name is \"Anne Smith and Thomas\". Compare \"I thank my friend, Smith and Wesson\", in which the ambiguity is obvious.\n\nAs a [[rule of thumb]], ''[[The Guardian]] Style Guide''<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/styleguide/o |title=Guardian and Observer style guide: O|accessdate=April 1, 2010 | work=The Guardian | location=London | date=2008-12-19}}</ref>\nsuggests that straightforward lists (''he ate ham, eggs and chips'') do not need a comma before the final \"and\", but sometimes it can help the reader (''he ate cereal, kippers, bacon, eggs, toast and marmalade, and tea''). ''The Chicago Manual of Style'', and other academic writing guides, require the serial comma: all lists must have a comma before the \"and\" prefacing the last item in a series.  {{see below|[[Comma#Differences between American and British usage|Differences between American and British usage]] below}}\n\nIf the individual items of a list are long, complex, affixed with description, or themselves contain commas, [[semicolon]]s may be preferred as separators, and the list may be introduced with a [[Colon (punctuation)|colon]].\n\nIn [[News style#Headline|news headlines]], a comma might replace the word \"and\", even if there are only two items, in order to save space, as in this headline from Reuters:<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-handshake-idUSKBN18L1OB|title=Trump, Macron engage in a little handshake diplomacy|date= 2017-05-25|work=Reuters|accessdate=2017-07-10}}</ref>\n* ''Trump, Macron engage in a little handshake diplomacy.''\n\n===Separation of clauses===\nCommas are often used to separate [[clause]]s. In English, a comma is used to separate a [[dependent clause]] from the [[independent clause]] if the dependent clause comes first: ''After I fed the cat, I brushed my clothes.'' (Compare this with ''I brushed my clothes after I fed the cat.'') A [[relative clause]] takes commas if it is non-[[restrictiveness|restrictive]], as in ''I cut down all the trees, which were over six feet tall.'' (Without the comma, this would mean that only the trees more than six feet tall were cut down.) Some style guides prescribe that two [[independent clause]]s joined by a coordinating [[Grammatical conjunction|conjunction]] (''for'', ''and'', ''nor'', ''but'', ''or'', ''yet'', ''so'') must be separated by a comma placed before the conjunction.<ref name=Fowler3rev1>{{Cite book | author1=Fowler, H.

Long [[coordinate clause]]s are nonetheless usually separated by commas:<ref>{{cite book|last=Swan |first=Michael |year=2006 |title=Practical English Usage |publisher=Oxford University Press}}</ref>\n* ''She had very little to live on, but she would never have dreamed of taking what was not hers.''\n\nIn some languages, such as [[German language|German]] and [[Polish language|Polish]], stricter rules apply on comma usage between clauses, with dependent clauses always being set off with commas, and commas being generally proscribed before certain coordinating conjunctions.\n\nThe joining of two independent sentences with a comma and no conjunction (as in \"It is nearly half past five, we cannot reach town before dark.\") is known as a [[comma splice]] and is sometimes considered an error in English;<ref>{{cite book|last=Strunk|first=William|title=The Elements of Style|date=May 2007|publisher=Filiquarian Publishing, LLC.|isbn=978-1-59986-933-9|page=12|quote=Do not join independent clauses by a comma.}}</ref> in most cases a semicolon should be used instead. A comma splice should not be confused, though, with [[asyndeton]], a literary device used for a specific effect in which coordinating conjunctions are purposely omitted.\n\n===Certain adverbs===\nCommas are always used to set off certain [[adverb]]s at the beginning of a sentence, including ''however'', ''in fact'', ''therefore'', ''nevertheless'', ''moreover'', ''furthermore'', and ''still''.\n\n* ''Therefore, a comma would be appropriate in this sentence.''\n* ''Nevertheless, I will not use one.''\n\nIf these adverbs appear in the middle of a sentence, they are followed and preceded by a comma. As in the second of the two examples below, if the two sentences are separated by a semicolon and the second sentence starts with an adverb, this adverb is preceded by a semicolon and followed by a comma.\n\n* ''In this sentence, furthermore, commas would also be called for.''\n* ''This sentence is similar; however, a semicolon is necessary as well.''\n\nUsing commas to offset certain adverbs is optional, including ''then'', ''so'', ''yet'', ''instead'', and ''too'' (meaning ''also'').\n\n* ''So, that's it for this rule.'' or\n* ''So that's it for this rule.''\n* ''A comma would be appropriate in this sentence, too.'' or\n* ''A comma would be appropriate in this sentence too.''\n\n=== Parenthetical phrases ===\n{{anchor|Parenthetical phrase}}\nCommas are often used to enclose [[parenthesis (rhetoric)|parenthetical]] words and phrases within a sentence (i.e., information that is not essential to the meaning of the sentence). Such phrases are both preceded and followed by a comma, unless that would result in a doubling of punctuation marks or the parenthetical is at the start or end of the sentence. The following are examples of types of parenthetical phrases:\n*Introductory phrase: ''Once upon a time, my father ate a muffin.''<ref>''Garner's Modern American Usage'', (Oxford: 2003, p. 655)</ref>\n*Interjection: ''My father ate the muffin, gosh darn it!''\n*Aside: ''My father, if you don't mind me telling you this, ate the muffin.''\n*[[Apposition|Appositive]]: ''My father, a jaded and bitter man, ate the muffin.''\n*Absolute phrase: ''My father, his eyes flashing with rage, ate the muffin.''\n*Free modifier: ''My father, chewing with unbridled fury, ate the muffin.''\n*Resumptive modifier: ''My father ate the muffin, a muffin which no man had yet chewed.''\n*Summative modifier: ''My father ate the muffin, a feat which no man had attempted.''\n\n===Between adjectives===\nA comma is used to separate ''coordinate adjectives'' (i.e., [[adjective#Adjective order|adjectives]] that directly and equally modify the following noun). Adjectives are considered coordinate if the meaning would be the same if their order were reversed or if ''and'' were placed between them. For example:\n*''The dull, incessant droning'' but ''the cute little cottage.''\n*''The devious lazy red frog'' suggests there are lazy red frogs (one of which is devious), while ''the devious, lazy red frog'' does not carry this connotation.\n\n===Before quotations===\nSome writers precede quoted material that is the grammatical object of an active verb of speaking or writing with a comma, as in ''Mr. Kershner says, \"You should know how to use a comma.\"'' Quotations that follow and support an assertion are often preceded by a [[Colon (punctuation)|colon]] rather than a comma.\n\nOther writers do not put a comma before quotations unless one would occur anyway. Thus they would write ''Mr. Kershner says \"You should know how to use a comma.\"''\n\n===In dates===\n\n====Month day, year====\nWhen a date is written as a month followed by a day followed by a year, a comma separates the day from the year: December 19, 1941. This style is common in American English.

This is almost always done for numbers of six or more digits and often for five or four digits but not in front of the number itself. However, in much of Europe, Southern Africa and Latin America, [[Full stop|period]]s or spaces are used instead; the comma is used as a decimal separator, equivalent to the use in English of the [[decimal mark|decimal point]]. In India, the groups are two digits, except for the rightmost group. In some styles, the comma may not be used for this purpose at all (e.g. in the [[International System of Units#Writing unit symbols and the values of quantities|SI writing style]]<ref>[http://standards.ieee.org/guides/style/section6.html#695 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc.]</ref>); a space may be used to separate groups of three digits instead.\n\n===In names===\nCommas are used when rewriting names to present the surname first, generally in instances of alphabetization by surname: ''Smith, John.'' They are also used before many titles that follow a name: ''John Smith, Ph.D.''\n\nSimilarly in lists that are presented with an inversion: ''...; socks, green: 3 pairs; socks, red: 2 pairs; tie, regimental: 1''.\n\n===Ellipsis===\nCommas may be used to indicate that a word, or a group of words, has been omitted,<ref>{{cite web|title=Writing Tips: Comma Use|url=http://www.cws.illinois.edu/workshop/writers/tips/commas/|website=Center for Writing Studies|publisher=[[University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign]]|accessdate=12 March 2017|quote=A comma is sometimes used to indicate the omission of one or more words.}}</ref> as in ''The cat was white; the dog, brown.'' (Here the comma replaces ''was''.)\n\n===Vocative===\nCommas are placed before, after, or around a noun or pronoun used independently in speaking to some person, place or thing:\n*''I hope, John, that you will read this.''\n\n===Between the subject and predicate===\nIn his 1785 essay ''An Essay on Punctuation'', [[Joseph Robertson (clergyman)|Joseph Robertson]] advocated a comma between the subject and predicate of long sentences for clarity; however, this usage is regarded as an error in modern times.\n*''The good taste of the present age, has not allowed us to neglect the cultivation of the English language.''\n*''Whoever is capable of forgetting a benefit, is an enemy to society.''\n\n===Differences between American and British usage in placement of commas and quotation marks===\nThe comma and the [[quotation mark]] pairing can be used in several ways. In American English, the comma is commonly included inside a quotation mark:<ref name=\"APA\"/><ref name=\"WilbersonChicago14\"/>\n*My mother gave me the nickname \"Bobby Bobby Bob Bob Boy,\" which really made me angry.\nIn Great Britain and many other parts of the world, punctuation is usually placed within quotation marks only if it is part of what is being quoted or referred to:<ref name=\"APA\">{{cite web |url= http://blog.apastyle.org/apastyle/2011/08/punctuating-around-quotation-marks.html |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->  |title=Punctuating Around Quotation Marks  |publisher=Style Guide of the American Psychological Association  |year=2011 |format=blog  |accessdate=2015-09-12}}</ref><ref name=\"WilbersonChicago14\">{{cite web  |url= http://www.wilbers.com/FAQPunctuation.htm  |author=Stephen Wilbers |title=Frequently Asked Questions Concerning Punctuation |format=web site |accessdate=2015-09-10}}</ref><ref name=SSF>{{cite book\n  |url= https://books.google.com/?id=PoFJ-OhE63UC&pg=PA180&lpg=PA180&dq=%22quotation+marks%22+%22according+to+sense%22+British#v=onepage&q=%22quotation%20marks%22%20%22according%20to%20sense%22%20British&f=false |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Scientific Style and Format: The CBE Manual for Authors, Editors and Publishers |location=Cambridge, U.K. |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2002  |format=PDF |quote=In the British style (OUP 1983), all signs of punctuation used with words and quotation marks must be placed ''according to the sense''.   |accessdate=2015-09-04|isbn=9780521471541 }}</ref>\n*My mother gave me the nickname \"Bobby Bobby Bob Bob Boy\", which really made me angry.\n\nDuring the [[Second World War]], the British carried the comma over into abbreviations.

This is useful in ''for'' [[statement (programming)|statement]]s and [[Macro (computer science)|macros]].\n\nIn [[Smalltalk]] and [[APL (programming language)|APL]], the comma operator is used to [[Concatenation|concatenate]] collections, including strings. In APL, it is also used [[Monad (functional programming)|monadically]] to rearrange the items of an array into a list.\n\nIn [[Prolog]], the comma is used to denote [[Logical Conjunction]] (\"and\").\n\nThe [[comma-separated values]] (CSV) format is very commonly used in exchanging text data between database and spreadsheet formats.\n\n==Diacritical usage==\n<!-- This section is linked from [[Romance languages]] -->\n{{main|D-comma|S-comma|T-comma}}\nIn [[French language|French]], a ''cedilla'' (not a comma) is used beneath a ''c'', producing ''[[\u00e7]]'', to indicate that the ''c'' is pronounced like ''s'' (a \"soft ''c''\") and not like ''k'' (a \"hard ''c''\"): ''fran\u00e7ais'', ''gar\u00e7on, a\u00e7a\u00ef''. Depending on the knowledge and resources of the typist or typesetter, the ''\u00e7'' is irregularly conserved on French words used in English, like ''fa\u00e7ade''.\n\nThe comma is used as a [[diacritic]] mark in [[Romanian language|Romanian]] under the ''s'' (''\u0218'', ''\u0219''), and under the ''t'' (''\u021a'', ''\u021b''). A [[cedilla]] is occasionally used instead of it, but this is technically incorrect. The symbol ''d\u0326'' ([[D-comma|''d'' with comma below]]) was used as part of the [[Romanian alphabet|Romanian transitional alphabet]] (19th century) to indicate the sounds denoted by the Latin letter ''[[z]]'' or letters ''dz'', where derived from a [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]] ''[[Dze|\u0455]]'' ({{IPA|/dz/}}). The comma and the cedilla are both derivative of a small cursive ''z'' (\u0292) placed below the letter. From this standpoint alone, ''\u0219'', ''\u021b'', and ''d\u0326'' could potentially be regarded as stand-ins for ''sz'', ''tz'', and ''dz'' respectively.\n\nIn [[Latvian language|Latvian]], the comma is used on the letters ''\u0123'', ''\u0137'', ''\u013c'', ''\u0146'', and historically also ''\u0157'', to indicate [[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatalization]]. Because the lowercase letter ''g'' has a [[descender]], the comma is rotated 180\u00b0 and placed over the letter. Although their [[Adobe Systems|Adobe]] [[glyph]] names are commas, their names in the [[Unicode]] Standard are ''g'', ''k'', ''l'', ''n'', and ''r'' with a [[cedilla]]. They were introduced to the Unicode standard before 1992, and their name cannot be altered.\n\nIn [[Livonian language|Livonian]], whose alphabet is based on a mixture of Latvian and [[Estonian language|Estonian]] alphabets, the comma is used on the letters ''\u1e11'', ''\u013c'', ''\u0146'', ''\u0157'', ''\u021b'' to indicate palatalization in the same fashion as Latvian, except that Livonian uses ''\u1e11'' and ''\u021b'' represent the same [[palatal consonant|palatal]] [[plosive consonant|plosive]] phonemes which Latvian writes as ''\u0123'' and ''\u0137'' respectively.\n\nIn [[Czech language|Czech]] and [[Slovak language|Slovak]], the diacritic in the characters ''\u010f'', ''\u0165'', and ''\u013e'' resembles a superscript comma, but it is used instead of a [[caron]] because the letter has an [[ascender (typography)|ascender]]. Other ascender letters with carons, such as letters ''\u021f'' (used in [[Finnish Kalo language|Finnish Romani]] and [[Lakota language|Lakota]]) and ''\u01e9'' (used in [[Skolt Sami language|Skolt Sami]]), did not modify their carons to superscript commas.\n\nIn 16th-century [[Guatemala]], the archaic letter [[cuatrillo]] with a comma (\ua72e, \ua72f) was used to write Mayan languages.<ref>{{cite web|last=Everson|first=Michael|authorlink=Michael Everson|title=N3028: Proposal to add Mayanist Latin letters to the UCS|url=https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2006/06028-n3028-tresillo.pdf|date=2006-01-30|accessdate=2017-02-04}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n===General===\n*[[List of typographical symbols]]\n*[[Copy editing]]\n*[[Decimal mark]]\n*[[Latin-derived alphabet]] \n*[[Ogonek]]\n*[[Parts of speech]]\n*[[Punctuation of English]]\n*[[Sentence clause structure]]\n*[[Traditional grammar]]\n\n===Related history===\n*[[History of sentence spacing]]\n*[[History of Western typography]]\n*[[History of typography in East Asia]]\n*[[Spread of European movable type printing]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n*{{FOLDOC}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commonscat|Commas|lcfirst=yes}}\n*[http://www.ego4u.com/en/cram-up/writing/comma English comma rules] and exercises\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20051013062145/http://wwwnew.towson.edu/ows/moduleCOMMA.htm Major Comma Uses]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20090901153356/http://geocities.com/markboonejesusfreak/academic/commas.htm Notes on Commas]\n*[http://www.learnenglishtoday.blogspot.com Comma guidelines \u2013 also helpful for non-native speakers]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20090327041029/http://www.sti.nasa.gov/publish/sp7084.pdf ''Grammar, Punctuation, and Capitalization'' \u2013 a comprehensive online guide by NASA]\n*[http://specgram.com/CL.2/03.doolittle.odcom.html The Oxford Comma: A Solution] \u2013 a satirical suggestion to settle the problem of the Oxford Comma once and for all.\n*[http://specgram.com/CLI.4/04.celen.quotta.html The Quotta and the Quottiod] \u2013 another satirical compromise between the American and British traditions relating to quotes and commas.\n*[http://www.grammarcheck.net/common-comma-problems/ Top 6 Common Comma Problems Infographic] by Jennifer Frost\n\n{{Latin script|comma}}\n{{navbox punctuation}}\n[[Category:Punctuation]]\n[[Category:Greek-script diacritics]]\n[[Category:Latin-script diacritics]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Punctuation mark}}\n{{other uses|Comma (disambiguation)}}\n{{Distinguish|coma}}\n{{Infobox punctuation mark|mark=,<!--\n-->|variant1=\u3001|caption1=[[Japanese punctuation|Japanese]] comma<!--\n-->|variant2=\u060c|caption2=[[Arabic script|Arabic]] comma<!--\n-->|variant3=\u25cc&#x0326;|caption3=[[diacritic|combining]] comma below\n|unicode={{unichar|002C|COMMA|html=}}}}\n\nThe '''comma''' {{not a typo|( , )}} is a [[punctuation]] mark that appears in several variants in different languages. It has the same shape as an [[apostrophe|apostrophe ( \u2019 )]]  or single closing [[quotation mark]] in many [[typeface]]s, but it differs from them in being placed on the baseline of the text. Some typefaces render it as a small line, slightly curved or straight but inclined from the vertical, or with the appearance of a small, filled-in {{not a typo|figure ''9''|reason=This is, very specifically, about the numeral/glyph/figure \"9\", not the word or concept \"nine\".}}.\n\nThe comma is used in many contexts and languages, mainly to separate parts of a [[sentence (linguistics)|sentence]] such as [[clause]]s, and items in lists, particularly when there are three or more items listed. The word ''comma'' comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{wikt-lang|grc|\u03ba\u03cc\u03bc\u03bc\u03b1}} ({{grc-transl|\u03ba\u03cc\u03bc\u03bc\u03b1}}), which originally meant a cut-off piece; specifically, in grammar, a short clause.<ref>{{OED|comma|id=36944}}</ref><ref>{{cite EB1911|wstitle=Comma|volume=6|page=765}}</ref>\n\nA comma-shaped mark is used as a [[diacritic]] in several writing systems, and is considered distinct from the [[cedilla]]. The [[rough breathing|rough]] and [[smooth breathing]]s ({{lang|grc|\u1f01, \u1f00}}) appear above the letter in [[Ancient Greek]], and the [[#Diacritical usage|comma diacritic]] appears below the letter in [[Latvian orthography|Latvian]], [[Romanian orthography|Romanian]], and [[Livonian orthography|Livonian]].\n\n==History==\n[[Punctuation]] is much more recent than the alphabet. \nIn the 3rd century BC, [[Aristophanes of Byzantium]] invented a system of single [[Interpunct|dots]] (''distinctiones'') that separated verses (colometry) and indicated the amount of breath needed to complete each fragment of the text when [[Reading (process)|reading]] aloud.<ref>{{cite book |title= Eats, Shoot & Leaves: The Zero Tolerance Approach to Punctuation|last= Truss|first= Lynn|year= 2004|publisher= Gotham Books|location= New York|isbn= 1-59240-087-6|page=72}}</ref>  The different lengths were signified by a dot at the bottom, middle, or top of the line.  For a short passage (a ''komma''), a ''media distinctio'' dot was placed mid-level (&nbsp;'''\u00b7'''&nbsp;).  This is the origin of the concept of a comma, although the name came to be used for the mark itself instead of the clause it separated.\n\nThe mark used today is descended from a diagonal [[slash (punctuation)|slash]], or ''virgula suspensiva'' (&nbsp;'''/'''&nbsp;), used from the 13th to 17th centuries to represent a pause. The modern comma was first used by [[Aldus Manutius]].<ref>[http://www.haverford.edu/classics/courses/2006S/lat101/handouts/no_spaces_aeneid.pdf Reading Before Punctuation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060902185038/http://www.haverford.edu/classics/courses/2006S/lat101/handouts/no_spaces_aeneid.pdf |date=September 2, 2006 }} \u2013 ''Introduction to Latin Literature'' pamphlet, [[Haverford College]]</ref><ref>[https://www.ualberta.ca/~sreimer/ms-course/course/punc.htm#mtop Manuscript Studies, Medieval and Early Modern] \u2013 [[Palaeography]]: Punctuation glossary</ref>\n\nMoreover, the mark is used to separate words, phrases and clauses in a sentence to help it to be understood: to divide a sentence into easily assimilated bite-sized pieces. However, there are many other functions of the comma, such as \"setting of questions\", \"emphasizing point of view\", and etc.<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.grammarly.com/blog/comma/ |title = Rules for Comma Usage|date = 2016-02-16}}</ref>\n\n==Uses in English==\nIn general, the comma shows that the words immediately before the comma are less closely or exclusively linked [[grammar|grammatically]] to those immediately after the comma than they might be otherwise. The comma performs a number of functions in [[English language|English]] writing. It is used in generally similar ways in other languages, particularly European ones, although the rules on comma usage \u2013 and their rigidity \u2013 vary from language to language.\n\n===The serial comma===\nCommas are placed between items in lists, as in ''They own a cat, a dog, two rabbits, and seven mice.''\n\nWhether the final conjunction, most frequently ''and'', should be preceded by a comma, called the ''serial comma'', is one of the most disputed linguistic or stylistic questions in English.\n\n*They served apples, peaches, and bananas. (serial comma used)\n*We cleaned up cores, pits and skins. (serial comma omitted)\n\n====American usage====\nThe serial comma is used much more often, usually routinely, in the United States. A majority of American style guides mandate its use, including ''[[The Chicago Manual of Style]]'', [[William Strunk, Jr.|Strunk]] and [[E. B. White|White]]'s classic ''[[The Elements of Style]]'', and the ''[[U.S. Government Printing Office]] Style Manual''. The ''AP Stylebook'' for journalistic writing advises against it.{{cn|date=October 2019}}\n\n\nThe serial comma is also known as the Oxford comma, Harvard comma, or series comma. It is sometimes perceived as overly careful or an Americanism{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}, but its usage occurs within both American and British English.  It is called the Oxford comma because of its long history of use by Oxford University Press.<ref name=OxfordD>{{cite encyclopedia | title = What is the 'Oxford comma'? | encyclopedia = Oxford Dictionaries | publisher = Oxford University Press | accessdate = 2015-09-15 | url =http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/us/words/what-is-the-oxford-comma?q=oxford+comma}}</ref>\n\nIt is used less often in British English, but some British style guides require it, including the [[Oxford University Press]] style manual and [[Henry Watson Fowler|Fowler]]'s ''[[Modern English Usage]]''. Some writers of British English use it only where necessary to avoid ambiguity.\n\nAccording to ''New Hart's Rules'', \"house style will dictate\" whether to use the serial comma, and \"The general rule is that one style or the other should be used consistently.\"  No association with region or dialect is suggested, other than that its use has been strongly advocated by Oxford University Press.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Ritter|first1=R. M.|title=New Hart's Rules|url=https://archive.org/details/newhartsrules00rmri|url-access=registration|date=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford, UK|pages=[https://archive.org/details/newhartsrules00rmri/page/77 77], 300|edition=Second}}</ref>\n\n\nis more frequent in the United States than in England; in England it may be called an Oxford comma, because the [[Oxford University Press]], uniquely in England, recommends it. It is recommended by the United States [[Government Printing Office]], [[Harvard University Press]], and the classic ''Elements of Style'' of [[Strunk and White]].\n\nUse of a comma may prevent ambiguity:\n\n* The sentence ''I spoke to the boys, Sam and Tom'' could mean either ''I spoke to the boys and Sam and Tom'' (I spoke to more than three people) or ''I spoke to the boys, who are Sam and Tom'' (I spoke to two people);\n* ''I spoke to the boys, Sam, and Tom'' \u2013 must be ''the boys and Sam and Tom'' (I spoke to more than three people).\n\nThe serial comma does not eliminate all confusion. Consider the following sentence:\n*''I thank my mother, Anne Smith, and Thomas.'' This could mean either ''my mother and Anne Smith and Thomas'' (three people) or ''my mother, who is Anne Smith; and Thomas'' (two people). This sentence might be recast as \"my mother (Anne Smith) and Thomas\" for clarity.\n* ''I thank my mother, Anne Smith and Thomas.'' Because the comma after \"mother\" is conventionally used to prepare the reader for an [[apposition|apposite phrase]] \u2013 that is, a renaming of or further information about a noun \u2013 this construction suggests that my mother's name is \"Anne Smith and Thomas\". Compare \"I thank my friend, Smith and Wesson\", in which the ambiguity is obvious.\n\nAs a [[rule of thumb]], ''[[The Guardian]] Style Guide''<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/styleguide/o |title=Guardian and Observer style guide: O|accessdate=April 1, 2010 | work=The Guardian | location=London | date=2008-12-19}}</ref>\nsuggests that straightforward lists (''he ate ham, eggs and chips'') do not need a comma before the final \"and\", but sometimes it can help the reader (''he ate cereal, kippers, bacon, eggs, toast and marmalade, and tea''). ''The Chicago Manual of Style'', and other academic writing guides, require the serial comma: all lists must have a comma before the \"and\" prefacing the last item in a series.  {{see below|[[Comma#Differences between American and British usage|Differences between American and British usage]] below}}\n\nIf the individual items of a list are long, complex, affixed with description, or themselves contain commas, [[semicolon]]s may be preferred as separators, and the list may be introduced with a [[Colon (punctuation)|colon]].\n\nIn [[News style#Headline|news headlines]], a comma might replace the word \"and\", even if there are only two items, in order to save space, as in this headline from Reuters:<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-handshake-idUSKBN18L1OB|title=Trump, Macron engage in a little handshake diplomacy|date= 2017-05-25|work=Reuters|accessdate=2017-07-10}}</ref>\n* ''Trump, Macron engage in a little handshake diplomacy.''\n\n===Separation of clauses===\nCommas are often used to separate [[clause]]s. In English, a comma is used to separate a [[dependent clause]] from the [[independent clause]] if the dependent clause comes first: ''After I fed the cat, I brushed my clothes.'' (Compare this with ''I brushed my clothes after I fed the cat.'') A [[relative clause]] takes commas if it is non-[[restrictiveness|restrictive]], as in ''I cut down all the trees, which were over six feet tall.'' (Without the comma, this would mean that only the trees more than six feet tall were cut down.) Some style guides prescribe that two [[independent clause]]s joined by a coordinating [[Grammatical conjunction|conjunction]] (''for'', ''and'', ''nor'', ''but'', ''or'', ''yet'', ''so'') must be separated by a comma placed before the conjunction.<ref name=Fowler3rev1>{{Cite book | author1=Fowler, H.

Long [[coordinate clause]]s are nonetheless usually separated by commas:<ref>{{cite book|last=Swan |first=Michael |year=2006 |title=Practical English Usage |publisher=Oxford University Press}}</ref>\n* ''She had very little to live on, but she would never have dreamed of taking what was not hers.''\n\nIn some languages, such as [[German language|German]] and [[Polish language|Polish]], stricter rules apply on comma usage between clauses, with dependent clauses always being set off with commas, and commas being generally proscribed before certain coordinating conjunctions.\n\nThe joining of two independent sentences with a comma and no conjunction (as in \"It is nearly half past five, we cannot reach town before dark.\") is known as a [[comma splice]] and is sometimes considered an error in English;<ref>{{cite book|last=Strunk|first=William|title=The Elements of Style|date=May 2007|publisher=Filiquarian Publishing, LLC.|isbn=978-1-59986-933-9|page=12|quote=Do not join independent clauses by a comma.}}</ref> in most cases a semicolon should be used instead. A comma splice should not be confused, though, with [[asyndeton]], a literary device used for a specific effect in which coordinating conjunctions are purposely omitted.\n\n===Certain adverbs===\nCommas are always used to set off certain [[adverb]]s at the beginning of a sentence, including ''however'', ''in fact'', ''therefore'', ''nevertheless'', ''moreover'', ''furthermore'', and ''still''.\n\n* ''Therefore, a comma would be appropriate in this sentence.''\n* ''Nevertheless, I will not use one.''\n\nIf these adverbs appear in the middle of a sentence, they are followed and preceded by a comma. As in the second of the two examples below, if the two sentences are separated by a semicolon and the second sentence starts with an adverb, this adverb is preceded by a semicolon and followed by a comma.\n\n* ''In this sentence, furthermore, commas would also be called for.''\n* ''This sentence is similar; however, a semicolon is necessary as well.''\n\nUsing commas to offset certain adverbs is optional, including ''then'', ''so'', ''yet'', ''instead'', and ''too'' (meaning ''also'').\n\n* ''So, that's it for this rule.'' or\n* ''So that's it for this rule.''\n* ''A comma would be appropriate in this sentence, too.'' or\n* ''A comma would be appropriate in this sentence too.''\n\n=== Parenthetical phrases ===\n{{anchor|Parenthetical phrase}}\nCommas are often used to enclose [[parenthesis (rhetoric)|parenthetical]] words and phrases within a sentence (i.e., information that is not essential to the meaning of the sentence). Such phrases are both preceded and followed by a comma, unless that would result in a doubling of punctuation marks or the parenthetical is at the start or end of the sentence. The following are examples of types of parenthetical phrases:\n*Introductory phrase: ''Once upon a time, my father ate a muffin.''<ref>''Garner's Modern American Usage'', (Oxford: 2003, p. 655)</ref>\n*Interjection: ''My father ate the muffin, gosh darn it!''\n*Aside: ''My father, if you don't mind me telling you this, ate the muffin.''\n*[[Apposition|Appositive]]: ''My father, a jaded and bitter man, ate the muffin.''\n*Absolute phrase: ''My father, his eyes flashing with rage, ate the muffin.''\n*Free modifier: ''My father, chewing with unbridled fury, ate the muffin.''\n*Resumptive modifier: ''My father ate the muffin, a muffin which no man had yet chewed.''\n*Summative modifier: ''My father ate the muffin, a feat which no man had attempted.''\n\n===Between adjectives===\nA comma is used to separate ''coordinate adjectives'' (i.e., [[adjective#Adjective order|adjectives]] that directly and equally modify the following noun). Adjectives are considered coordinate if the meaning would be the same if their order were reversed or if ''and'' were placed between them. For example:\n*''The dull, incessant droning'' but ''the cute little cottage.''\n*''The devious lazy red frog'' suggests there are lazy red frogs (one of which is devious), while ''the devious, lazy red frog'' does not carry this connotation.\n\n===Before quotations===\nSome writers precede quoted material that is the grammatical object of an active verb of speaking or writing with a comma, as in ''Mr. Kershner says, \"You should know how to use a comma.\"'' Quotations that follow and support an assertion are often preceded by a [[Colon (punctuation)|colon]] rather than a comma.\n\nOther writers do not put a comma before quotations unless one would occur anyway. Thus they would write ''Mr. Kershner says \"You should know how to use a comma.\"''\n\n===In dates===\n\n====Month day, year====\nWhen a date is written as a month followed by a day followed by a year, a comma separates the day from the year: December 19, 1941. This style is common in American English. The comma is used to avoid confusing consecutive numbers: December 19&nbsp;1941.\nMost style manuals, including ''[[The Chicago Manual of Style]]''<ref>Chicago Manual of Style:\n\"It's conventional to put a comma after the year. The commas are like parentheses here, so it doesn't make sense to have only one.\"</ref>\nand the ''[[AP Stylebook]]'',<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.apstylebook.com/ask_editor.php |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081204072022/https://www.apstylebook.com/ask_editor.php |archive-date=4 December 2008 |title=Ask the Editor |accessdate=2019-06-07<!--2008-10-29--> |work=AP Stylebook |date=3 December 2008 |quote=When a phrase refers to a month, day and year, set off the year with commas...

Additionally, most style manuals, including ''[[The Chicago Manual of Style]]''<ref>\n\"Mary traveled to Seattle, Washington, before going on to California.\" {{cite web |url=http://www.chicagomanualofstyle.org/CMS_FAQ/Commas/Commas29.html |title=Chicago Style Q&A: Commas |accessdate=2008-10-29 |work=The Chicago Manual of Style Online}}</ref>\nand the ''AP Stylebook'',<ref>\"Acme Pens was founded in Padua, Italy, in 2004.\" {{cite web |url=http://www.apstylebook.com/ask_editor.php |title=Ask the Editor |accessdate=2008-10-29 |work=AP Stylebook |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081204072022/http://www.apstylebook.com/ask_editor.php |archive-date=2008-12-04 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\nrecommend that the second element be treated as a parenthetical, requiring a second comma after: ''\"The plane landed in Kampala, [[Uganda]], that evening.\"''<ref>\n''Chicago Manual of Style'', 14th ed., \u00a75.67.</ref>\n\nThe [[United States Postal Service]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.usps.com/ship/preparing-domestic-shipments.htm|title=Preparing Shipments|publisher=The United States Postal Service}}</ref> and [[Royal Mail]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://personal.help.royalmail.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/81|title=How to address your mail|publisher=Royal Mail (UK)}}</ref> recommend leaving out punctuation when writing addresses on actual letters and packages, as the marks hinder [[optical character recognition]].\n\n===In numbers===\n{{main|Decimal mark}}\nIn representing large numbers, from the right side to the left, English texts usually use commas to separate each group of three digits in front of the decimal. This is almost always done for numbers of six or more digits and often for five or four digits but not in front of the number itself. However, in much of Europe, Southern Africa and Latin America, [[Full stop|period]]s or spaces are used instead; the comma is used as a decimal separator, equivalent to the use in English of the [[decimal mark|decimal point]]. In India, the groups are two digits, except for the rightmost group. In some styles, the comma may not be used for this purpose at all (e.g. in the [[International System of Units#Writing unit symbols and the values of quantities|SI writing style]]<ref>[http://standards.ieee.org/guides/style/section6.html#695 Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers, Inc.]</ref>); a space may be used to separate groups of three digits instead.\n\n===In names===\nCommas are used when rewriting names to present the surname first, generally in instances of alphabetization by surname: ''Smith, John.'' They are also used before many titles that follow a name: ''John Smith, Ph.D.''\n\nSimilarly in lists that are presented with an inversion: ''...; socks, green: 3 pairs; socks, red: 2 pairs; tie, regimental: 1''.\n\n===Ellipsis===\nCommas may be used to indicate that a word, or a group of words, has been omitted,<ref>{{cite web|title=Writing Tips: Comma Use|url=http://www.cws.illinois.edu/workshop/writers/tips/commas/|website=Center for Writing Studies|publisher=[[University of Illinois at Urbana\u2013Champaign]]|accessdate=12 March 2017|quote=A comma is sometimes used to indicate the omission of one or more words.}}</ref> as in ''The cat was white; the dog, brown.'' (Here the comma replaces ''was''.)\n\n===Vocative===\nCommas are placed before, after, or around a noun or pronoun used independently in speaking to some person, place or thing:\n*''I hope, John, that you will read this.''\n\n===Between the subject and predicate===\nIn his 1785 essay ''An Essay on Punctuation'', [[Joseph Robertson (clergyman)|Joseph Robertson]] advocated a comma between the subject and predicate of long sentences for clarity; however, this usage is regarded as an error in modern times.\n*''The good taste of the present age, has not allowed us to neglect the cultivation of the English language.''\n*''Whoever is capable of forgetting a benefit, is an enemy to society.''\n\n===Differences between American and British usage in placement of commas and quotation marks===\nThe comma and the [[quotation mark]] pairing can be used in several ways. In American English, the comma is commonly included inside a quotation mark:<ref name=\"APA\"/><ref name=\"WilbersonChicago14\"/>\n*My mother gave me the nickname \"Bobby Bobby Bob Bob Boy,\" which really made me angry.\nIn Great Britain and many other parts of the world, punctuation is usually placed within quotation marks only if it is part of what is being quoted or referred to:<ref name=\"APA\">{{cite web |url= http://blog.apastyle.org/apastyle/2011/08/punctuating-around-quotation-marks.html |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.-->  |title=Punctuating Around Quotation Marks  |publisher=Style Guide of the American Psychological Association  |year=2011 |format=blog  |accessdate=2015-09-12}}</ref><ref name=\"WilbersonChicago14\">{{cite web  |url= http://www.wilbers.com/FAQPunctuation.htm  |author=Stephen Wilbers |title=Frequently Asked Questions Concerning Punctuation |format=web site |accessdate=2015-09-10}}</ref><ref name=SSF>{{cite book\n  |url= https://books.google.com/?id=PoFJ-OhE63UC&pg=PA180&lpg=PA180&dq=%22quotation+marks%22+%22according+to+sense%22+British#v=onepage&q=%22quotation%20marks%22%20%22according%20to%20sense%22%20British&f=false |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |title=Scientific Style and Format: The CBE Manual for Authors, Editors and Publishers |location=Cambridge, U.K. |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2002  |format=PDF |quote=In the British style (OUP 1983), all signs of punctuation used with words and quotation marks must be placed ''according to the sense''.   |accessdate=2015-09-04|isbn=9780521471541 }}</ref>\n*My mother gave me the nickname \"Bobby Bobby Bob Bob Boy\", which really made me angry.\n\nDuring the [[Second World War]], the British carried the comma over into abbreviations.

This is useful in ''for'' [[statement (programming)|statement]]s and [[Macro (computer science)|macros]].\n\nIn [[Smalltalk]] and [[APL (programming language)|APL]], the comma operator is used to [[Concatenation|concatenate]] collections, including strings. In APL, it is also used [[Monad (functional programming)|monadically]] to rearrange the items of an array into a list.\n\nIn [[Prolog]], the comma is used to denote [[Logical Conjunction]] (\"and\").\n\nThe [[comma-separated values]] (CSV) format is very commonly used in exchanging text data between database and spreadsheet formats.\n\n==Diacritical usage==\n<!-- This section is linked from [[Romance languages]] -->\n{{main|D-comma|S-comma|T-comma}}\nIn [[French language|French]], a ''cedilla'' (not a comma) is used beneath a ''c'', producing ''[[\u00e7]]'', to indicate that the ''c'' is pronounced like ''s'' (a \"soft ''c''\") and not like ''k'' (a \"hard ''c''\"): ''fran\u00e7ais'', ''gar\u00e7on, a\u00e7a\u00ef''. Depending on the knowledge and resources of the typist or typesetter, the ''\u00e7'' is irregularly conserved on French words used in English, like ''fa\u00e7ade''.\n\nThe comma is used as a [[diacritic]] mark in [[Romanian language|Romanian]] under the ''s'' (''\u0218'', ''\u0219''), and under the ''t'' (''\u021a'', ''\u021b''). A [[cedilla]] is occasionally used instead of it, but this is technically incorrect. The symbol ''d\u0326'' ([[D-comma|''d'' with comma below]]) was used as part of the [[Romanian alphabet|Romanian transitional alphabet]] (19th century) to indicate the sounds denoted by the Latin letter ''[[z]]'' or letters ''dz'', where derived from a [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]] ''[[Dze|\u0455]]'' ({{IPA|/dz/}}). The comma and the cedilla are both derivative of a small cursive ''z'' (\u0292) placed below the letter. From this standpoint alone, ''\u0219'', ''\u021b'', and ''d\u0326'' could potentially be regarded as stand-ins for ''sz'', ''tz'', and ''dz'' respectively.\n\nIn [[Latvian language|Latvian]], the comma is used on the letters ''\u0123'', ''\u0137'', ''\u013c'', ''\u0146'', and historically also ''\u0157'', to indicate [[Palatalization (phonetics)|palatalization]]. Because the lowercase letter ''g'' has a [[descender]], the comma is rotated 180\u00b0 and placed over the letter. Although their [[Adobe Systems|Adobe]] [[glyph]] names are commas, their names in the [[Unicode]] Standard are ''g'', ''k'', ''l'', ''n'', and ''r'' with a [[cedilla]]. They were introduced to the Unicode standard before 1992, and their name cannot be altered.\n\nIn [[Livonian language|Livonian]], whose alphabet is based on a mixture of Latvian and [[Estonian language|Estonian]] alphabets, the comma is used on the letters ''\u1e11'', ''\u013c'', ''\u0146'', ''\u0157'', ''\u021b'' to indicate palatalization in the same fashion as Latvian, except that Livonian uses ''\u1e11'' and ''\u021b'' represent the same [[palatal consonant|palatal]] [[plosive consonant|plosive]] phonemes which Latvian writes as ''\u0123'' and ''\u0137'' respectively.\n\nIn [[Czech language|Czech]] and [[Slovak language|Slovak]], the diacritic in the characters ''\u010f'', ''\u0165'', and ''\u013e'' resembles a superscript comma, but it is used instead of a [[caron]] because the letter has an [[ascender (typography)|ascender]]. Other ascender letters with carons, such as letters ''\u021f'' (used in [[Finnish Kalo language|Finnish Romani]] and [[Lakota language|Lakota]]) and ''\u01e9'' (used in [[Skolt Sami language|Skolt Sami]]), did not modify their carons to superscript commas.\n\nIn 16th-century [[Guatemala]], the archaic letter [[cuatrillo]] with a comma (\ua72e, \ua72f) was used to write Mayan languages.<ref>{{cite web|last=Everson|first=Michael|authorlink=Michael Everson|title=N3028: Proposal to add Mayanist Latin letters to the UCS|url=https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2006/06028-n3028-tresillo.pdf|date=2006-01-30|accessdate=2017-02-04}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n===General===\n*[[List of typographical symbols]]\n*[[Copy editing]]\n*[[Decimal mark]]\n*[[Latin-derived alphabet]] \n*[[Ogonek]]\n*[[Parts of speech]]\n*[[Punctuation of English]]\n*[[Sentence clause structure]]\n*[[Traditional grammar]]\n\n===Related history===\n*[[History of sentence spacing]]\n*[[History of Western typography]]\n*[[History of typography in East Asia]]\n*[[Spread of European movable type printing]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n*{{FOLDOC}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commonscat|Commas|lcfirst=yes}}\n*[http://www.ego4u.com/en/cram-up/writing/comma English comma rules] and exercises\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20051013062145/http://wwwnew.towson.edu/ows/moduleCOMMA.htm Major Comma Uses]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20090901153356/http://geocities.com/markboonejesusfreak/academic/commas.htm Notes on Commas]\n*[http://www.learnenglishtoday.blogspot.com Comma guidelines \u2013 also helpful for non-native speakers]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20090327041029/http://www.sti.nasa.gov/publish/sp7084.pdf ''Grammar, Punctuation, and Capitalization'' \u2013 a comprehensive online guide by NASA]\n*[http://specgram.com/CL.2/03.doolittle.odcom.html The Oxford Comma: A Solution] \u2013 a satirical suggestion to settle the problem of the Oxford Comma once and for all.\n*[http://specgram.com/CLI.4/04.celen.quotta.html The Quotta and the Quottiod] \u2013 another satirical compromise between the American and British traditions relating to quotes and commas.\n*[http://www.grammarcheck.net/common-comma-problems/ Top 6 Common Comma Problems Infographic] by Jennifer Frost\n\n{{Latin script|comma}}\n{{navbox punctuation}}\n[[Category:Punctuation]]\n[[Category:Greek-script diacritics]]\n[[Category:Latin-script diacritics]]\n", "name_user": "46.68.9.114", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(no u)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma"}

The line which ran through the nearby villages and seaside towns of [[Mablethorpe]], [[Sutton-on-Sea]], [[Grimoldby]], [[Saltfleetby]], [[Theddlethorpe]], [[Mumby]] and [[Willoughby, Lincolnshire|Willoughby]]. The station was the terminus on the [[Louth to Bardney Line]] which opened in 1876 but closed in 1951 to passengers and to freight traffic in 1960. Bardney was the terminus of the branch line and was on the [[Lincolnshire Loop Line]]\n\nThe station closed to passengers in 1970 along with the Mablethorpe Loop Line and the section from [[Firsby railway station|Firsby]] to Louth of the East Lincolnshire Railway. The section to Grimsby remained in use for freight traffic until December 1980 when it closed and was later removed.\n\nThe station building and Louth North Signal Box remain in situ to this day as private dwellings. All of the station site has been built on by residential and commercial outlets.\n\nThere are plans to eventually have Louth as the southern terminus of the [[Lincolnshire Wolds Railway]] which would utilise the trackbed from Louth to Holton-Le-Clay, although it will be to the north of Louth due to the station building now being occupied and the station site around it built over. This would mean Louth would have a rail connection for the first time in almost 50 years, since the closure to passengers in 1970, but at a new station site.\n\nA canal was built between 1765 and 1770 to connect Louth to the sea at Tetney. It was formally abandoned in 1924.\nA fuller account is at [[Louth Canal]].\n\nThere are regular buses connecting Louth with the nearby Grimsby, Skegness, Mablethorpe and Lincoln. There is also a direct service once a month to [[York]] and National Express coaches call at Louth bus station. All services are operated by different companies but the main one is [[Stagecoach]]. However, unlike other towns. The town is not served by late-night services with the last bus departing the town at 7:00 pm.\n\nThe nearest active railway station is now Grimsby and Skegness.\n\n==St James' Church==\n[[File:Lincolnshire Rising plaque - geograph.org.uk - 860306.jpg|thumb|Lincolnshire Rising plaque in Louth]]\n{{see also|St James' Church, Louth|Lincolnshire Rising}}\n\nThe town was the origin of the [[Lincolnshire Rising]], which started on 1 October 1536 in [[St. James Church, Louth|St James Church]].

The line which ran through the nearby villages and seaside towns of [[Mablethorpe]], [[Sutton-on-Sea]], [[Grimoldby]], [[Saltfleetby]], [[Theddlethorpe]], [[Mumby]] and [[Willoughby, Lincolnshire|Willoughby]]. The station was the terminus on the [[Louth to Bardney Line]] which opened in 1876 but closed in 1951 to passengers and to freight traffic in 1960. Bardney was the terminus of the branch line and was on the [[Lincolnshire Loop Line]]\n\nThe station closed to passengers in 1970 along with the Mablethorpe Loop Line and the section from [[Firsby railway station|Firsby]] to Louth of the East Lincolnshire Railway. The section to Grimsby remained in use for freight traffic until December 1980 when it closed and was later removed.\n\nThe station building and Louth North Signal Box remain in situ to this day as private dwellings. All of the station site has been built on by residential and commercial outlets.\n\nThere are plans to eventually have Louth as the southern terminus of the [[Lincolnshire Wolds Railway]] which would utilise the trackbed from Louth to Holton-Le-Clay, although it will be to the north of Louth due to the station building now being occupied and the station site around it built over. This would mean Louth would have a rail connection for the first time in almost 50 years, since the closure to passengers in 1970, but at a new station site.\n\nA canal was built between 1765 and 1770 to connect Louth to the sea at Tetney. It was formally abandoned in 1924.\nA fuller account is at [[Louth Canal]].\n\nThere are regular buses connecting Louth with the nearby Grimsby, Skegness, Mablethorpe and Lincoln. There is also a direct service once a month to [[York]] and National Express coaches call at Louth bus station. All services are operated by different companies but the main one is [[Stagecoach]]. However, unlike other towns.

Starting as a sex therapist and feminist, she came to public prominence in the 1970s, establishing a career in publishing and broadcasting as well as writing several books. In the last two decades she has abandoned feminism and attracted controversy with her social commentary and her views on sexual abuse, domestic violence and men's rights advocacy.\n\n== Early life ==\nArndt was born in [[Penrith, England]], to the economist [[Heinz Wolfgang Arndt|Heinz Arndt]] (1915 \u2013 6 May 2002) and Ruth (''n\u00e9e'' Strohsahl) (20 March 1915 \u2013 20 March 2001), the youngest of three children.<ref name=\"rats\"/><ref name=\"Talking\"/> Her parents were German, and escaped [[Nazi Germany]] prior to [[WWII]].<ref name=\"father\"/> They emigrated to Australia in 1945 and she grew up in [[Canberra]].<ref name=\"rats\"/><ref name=\"Talking\"/>\n\n== Education ==\nIn 1971, after completing a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree at the [[Australian National University]], Arndt moved to [[Sydney]] and studied at the [[University of New South Wales]] where she completed a [[Master of Psychology]] degree in 1973;<ref name=\"rats\" /><ref name=\"quals\"/> her thesis was on orgasm dysfunction.<ref name=\"gleeson\"/><ref name=\"Overington\"/>\n\n== Family ==\nSince graduating, Arndt has predominantly lived in [[Woollahra]] in the eastern-suburbs of Sydney [[New South Wales]]. She was first married to journalist Dennis Minogue in 1977, who died in 1981. Arndt and Minogue were business partners during this time. Her second marriage was to American corporate lawyer Warren Scott in 1986, and they divorced in 2007. During the years 1986 to 1991 she lived with Scott in the borough of [[Manhattan]] in [[New York City]] NY. Arndt has three children of her own, two girls and one boy.<ref name=\"advocate\"/><ref name=\"rats\"/><ref name=\"sexpert\"/><ref name=\"marries\"/>\n\n== Career ==\nAfter graduation, Arndt practiced as a [[sex therapist]] until 1981.<ref name=\"cv2011\"/> She describes herself as \"one of Australia's first sex therapists\".<ref name=\"stripped\"/>\n\nArndt came to prominence in the 1970s by editing ''Forum'', an Australian adult sex education magazine, which led to frequent radio and television appearances. She was appointed editor in 1974 and remained in the position until July 1982.<ref name=\"advocate\"/> The publication proved controversial in conservative circles, and in [[Queensland Parliament]] in 1977 MP [[Des Frawley]] said: \"It is a dirty, filthy magazine\".<ref name=\"hansard\"/> [[Queensland Police Service|Queensland police]] also raided a newsagent, seizing copies of the magazine, requesting the proprietor [[show cause]].<ref name=\"Talking\"/>\n\nBetween 1973 and 1976 the [[Australian Broadcasting Control Board]] had ruled, without explanation, that all TV and radio programs in which Arndt takes part in be pre-recorded so that they may be approved by station management before being transmitted.<ref name=\"abt\" /><ref name=\"tharunka\" />\n\nIn 1978 Arndt said that \"The sexual revolution has been a [[damp squib]]\" expressing some doubts about what level people were really more sophisticated in their attitudes toward sex. She did acknowledge that the The [[Women's Movement]] had made physiological discoveries about the sexuality of women, that there was more tolerance to one's [[sexual preference]], and there had been a recognition of the importance of sex for [[senior citizens]] and those with [[disabilities]]. Arndt also praised the introduction of [[South Australian]] laws criminalising [[rape]] within marriage.<ref name=\"noisy\"/>\n\nHer work in sex education also involved postgraduate courses, seminars and lectures for groups including doctors and other professionals. Following the death of her husband and business partner, Dennis Minogue, in 1981, ''Forum'' magazine closed.<ref name=\"advocate\" /> In the mid 1980s, Arndt wrote for ''[[Australian Playboy]]''<ref name=\"tharunka\"/> and also wrote about broader social issues for newspapers including ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' and ''[[The Age]]''. During this period Arndt also had her own radio program on [[2GB]] and regular radio segments in major cities all over Australia. In 1982 she appeared on the TV panel-show series ''[[Beauty and the Beast (talk show)|Beauty and the Beast]]''<ref name=\"beauty\" /> and, from 1981 to 1986, was a weekly guest on television program ''[[Today (Australian TV program)|The Today Show]]''.<ref name=\"cv2011\" />\n\nIn 1984, Arndt ran a mail-order lingerie and sex toy business and authored a number of books on sex advice, including ''The Bettina Arndt Guide to Lovemaking for Women'', in which she wrote that \"Looking at what's happening to men and women in bed today, it wouldn't surprise me at all if more and more males chose to stick to their beer. Sex is fast becoming a battlefield, with women calling more of the shots.\"<ref name=\"gleeson\"/>\n\nIn 1986 Arndt moved to New York City for five years and, while living in the United States, wrote a weekly newspaper column syndicated through ''The Age'' in [[Melbourne]] (and published in Canberra, [[Adelaide]], [[Perth]] and [[Brisbane]]). She had two books published featuring collections of her writings, ''Private Lives'' (1985) and ''All About Us'' (1989).<ref name=\"sexpert\"/> In 1991, Arndt returned with her family to live in Australia.<ref name=\"advocate\"/>\n\nFrom the 1990s onward Arndt wrote a personal advice column for ''[[Cleo (magazine)|Cleo magazine]]'',<ref name=\"cv2011\"/> wrote for ''[[The Bulletin (Australian periodical)|The Bulletin]]'',<ref name=\"Talking\"/> ''[[The Australian]]'' and ''[[The Australian Women's Weekly]]''. She was a guest reporter on ''[[Four Corners (Australian TV program)|Four Corners]]'' on [[ABC TV (Australia)|ABC TV]]<ref name=\"gg\"/> and a regular guest on [[ABC Local Radio|ABC radio]] in Sydney, Melbourne, Canberra and Adelaide.<ref name=\"cv2011\"/> She was on the board of the [[Australian National University]] and was the president of the board of the [[Royal Women's Hospital]] Foundation in 1999. She also served as an online dating coach from 2001 to 2017,<ref name=\"gg\"/> and more recently has assisted men in writing their dating profiles and referring them on to good photographers for their dating profile photos.<ref name=\"could be\"/>\n\nDuring the first half of her career Arndt was a [[feminist]], but since the mid 1990s<ref name=\"gleeson\"/> has turned to men's rights advocacy.<ref name=\"heterosexual\"/><ref name=\"removed\"/><ref name=\"jill\"/> Her later work encapsulated socially conservative ideas about relationships and family structures.<ref name=\"removed\"/><ref name=\"advocate\"/> In 2010, Arndt said, \"I spent my early career lobbying for women but turned to men when I realised how lousy they are about advocating for issues that affect their private lives.\"<ref name=\"Overington\"/> Kate Gleeson, a senior lecturer at [[Macquarie Law School]] who has studied her, says \"Arndt's extolling of men's rights, as well as her critique of feminist analyses of domestic violence, sexual assault, sexual harassment and sex within marriage, has provoked feminist ire in the press\", adding \"To Arndt's frustration, the male revolution she advocated of political reaction against feminism had failed to emerge\".<ref name=\"gleeson\"/>\n\nDuring the conservative [[Howard Government]] (1996-2007) Arndt was brought into the fold as an adviser on issues such as assisted reproduction, education and child support.<ref name=\"gleeson\"/> She served on a number of committees advising the Australian Government on policy matters, including the National Advisory Committee on Ageing (2003), the Assisted Reproductive Technologies Review Team (2005) and the Child Support Review Reference Group (2004).<ref name=\"gg\"/> In 2003 the government awarded her the [[Centenary Medal]], which recognises \"people who made a contribution to Australian society or government.\".<ref name=\"cv2011\"/><ref name=\"centenary-medal\"/> Gleeson observed that at this time Arndt had a \"persistent criticism of matters of [[family law]]\".<ref name=\"gleeson\"/> A government committee she was part of from 2000 to 2001, the Family Law Pathways Advisory Group, was instrumental in later redrafting Australian family law.<ref name=\"gleeson\"/><ref name=\"crossed\"/>\n\nIn 2007, the Australian television program ''[[Media Watch (TV program)|Media Watch]]'' demonstrated that a newspaper article written by Arndt for the ''[[Brisbane Courier Mail]]'' plagiarised large tracts of a ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'' article by [[Dick Taverne]] published three years earlier.<ref name=\"leftovers\"/> The program also accused Arndt of journalistic non-disclosure in a column she wrote for ''The Sydney Morning Herald'' when she identified [[Kerryn Phelps]]'s same-sex marriage to [[Ascham School|Ascham Girls' School]] teacher Jackie Stricker. Arndt failed to disclose that her daughter attended the school and Phelps holds Arndt partly responsible for ending her wife's career there. In her defence Arndt said that \"I've never been anti-gay\", saying she was merely reporting the anxieties of some Ascham parents.<ref name=\"advocate\"/>\n\nArndt wrote ''The Sex Diaries'', based on the diaries of 98 couples talking about how they negotiate sex and deal with mismatched desire. It was published in 2009, followed by ''What Men Want'', another diary project published in September 2010.<ref name=\"advocate\"/><ref name=\"blokes\"/>\n\nIn 2010, ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald#Good Weekend|Good Weekend]]'' said she had repositioned herself as \"a champion of the downtrodden male of the species\", adding that \"In her writing, the former libertine started to sound like a self-appointed guardian of public morals.\" Her friend Merri Southwood said of Arndt's newspaper columns at the time, \"I'm not sure how much of it is the author seeking an audience and how much is the genuine Bettina ... Because, in fact, the way she writes is sometimes a little at odds with her own personal life.\"<ref name=\"advocate\"/>\n\nIn 2020 Arndt's previously good relationship with political conservatives and the conservative media shifted. ''Media Watch'' reported that \"Arndt has been in the media for more than 40 years and has written for many of Australia's leading papers and magazines as sex therapist, [[social commentator]] and, most recently, outspoken men's rights advocate\". But her comments on the [[murder of Hannah Clarke]] incident in 2020 had since led to near universal condemnation in the media, including those she had previously worked with. ''Media Watch'' questioned whether or not they would use her again in the future.<ref name=\"condemned\"/> When questioned about Arndt's time advising the Howard Government (1996-2007), Victorian [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal]] shadow minister [[Tim Smith (Australian politician)|Tim Smith]] said: \"I think Bettina Arndt has become more extreme as the years have gone by. I don't think she was nearly this extreme during the Howard Government years. I think some of her commentary of recent years has gone beyond mainstream Australia to the fringes.\"<ref name=\"crossed\"/> [[News Corp Australia|News Corp's]] [[David Penberthy]] lamented the loss of the Arndt of the 70s and 80s when she was a sex therapist and a \"fun person... trying to make couples happier through sex\", saying she seems to have now \"herded all of the really angry guys in Australia into the one corner and has, sort of, created almost a business model out of it\".<ref name=\"storm\"/>\n\n===Men's rights activism===\nArndt has now been termed a [[men's rights activist]],<ref name=\":2\"/><ref name=\"hurtful\"/><ref name=\"removed\"/><ref name=\"jill\"/> and says \"we need to start calling out feminism which is a really destructive force in our society\".<ref name=\"condemned\"/> She believes there is a pervasive \"anti-male bias\" in society, media and the law - also extending into in areas such as divorce, cancer research and domestic violence - saying that women are prioritised, thus denying men their rights.<ref name=\"toxic\"/> In 2012, [[Janet Albrechtsen|Albrechtsen]] wrote that Arndt \"now argues that with women dominating public discussion of gender and sexual issues, men's views are being silenced\".<ref name=\"Albrechtsen\"/> Arndt argues that \"[[radical feminism]], where men are presented as violent and sexist, is guilty of manshaming and destroying what should be a bond of mutual acceptance and respect between the sexes\".<ref name=\"toxic\"/> Arndt has been accused of being hostile towards women.<ref name=\"storm\"/><ref name=\"hurtful\"/> Author [[Susan Maushart]] says that Arndt \"seems, for whatever reason, to not like women very much\".<ref name=\"advocate\"/>\n\n===On partnerships and parenting===\nWhen Australia's first female prime minister, [[Julia Gillard]] (Labor), was elected in 2010, Arndt criticised the new prime minister for setting a bad example by living in a [[Common-law marriage|de facto]] relationship, or as Arndt described it \"marriage lite\".<ref name=\"gleeson\"/>\n\nArndt has been criticised for dismissing genuine academic research when writing about the children of [[LGBTIQ]] parents. Ex Federal Senator [[Brian Greig]] denounced Arndt for using \"the work of 'researchers' with strong links to the American religious right\" when discussing [[same-sex parenting]], saying she should have been \"able to distinguish such research from sham, politically motivated studies.\"<ref name=\"qnews\"/>\n\n===Comments about sexual abuse===\nArndt has drawn controversy over several incidents in which she has been accused of downplaying the [[sexual abuse]] of children by adults.\n\nShe has suggested that rape is not always violent and has said that most children do not incur long-term damage from sexual assault.<ref name=\"silence\"/>\n\nIn 1997, Arndt defended a doctor who had molested a 12-year-old child and other patients including herself,<ref name=\"victimhood\"/> arguing that he should not be charged because in another context masturbation would have been \"a loving and pleasurable act\".<ref name=\":0\"/>\n\nIn 2005, in an article in ''[[The Courier-Mail]]'', Arndt discussed convicted [[paedophile]] Robert Potter, a scoutmaster who had molested four boys, one of whom subsequently attempted suicide. She described Potter as \"a good bloke\"<ref name=\"victimhood\"/> and argued that \"such minor abuse rarely has lasting consequences\".<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn a 2012 article she wrote that \"Demonising sexuality inevitably distorts a proper perspective on sexual crimes, leading to politically inspired calls for absurdly longer sentences, misinformation about the likelihood of offenders to reoffend and exaggeration of the emotional damage to the victims of minor abuse\" and that \"Our prurient interest in sex crimes often robs the perpetrator of any chance of redemption - as the sad death of cricket commentator [[Peter Roebuck]] bears witness.\"<ref name=\"prudes\"/>\n \nIn 2017, Arndt conducted a 17-minute interview for her YouTube channel with Nicolaas Bester, a high school teacher in [[Tasmania]] who in 2011 was sentenced to two years and 10 months jail for sexual assault,<ref name=\"urges\" /> maintaining a sexual relationship with a 15-year-old student<ref name=\"jailed\"/> and possessing child pornography.<ref name=\"ironic\"/> He was subsequently jailed again for producing child exploitation material<ref name=\"awesome\"/><ref name=\"silent\"/> and bragging that the sexual abuse had been \"awesome\".<ref name=\"hits back\"/> In the video, Arndt referred to \"sexually provocative behaviour from female students\" and said young women should \"behave sensibly and not exploit their seductive power to ruin the lives of men\". Bester's victim subsequently criticised Arndt for supporting Bester and accusing her of trivialising his crime,<ref name=\"arndt awarded\"/> saying there \"was no evidence of my provocative behaviour\". \"Not only is the interview disturbing because it gives a platform to a paedophile. It's not a truthful interview.\"<ref name=\"survivor\"/> Arndt was criticised for not seeking out the victim for her side of the story.<ref name=\"4bc\"/><ref name=\"ironic\" /> Following widespread public outrage, Arndt apologised for her tone and said her interview was in poor taste, but in a later interview said of Bester that \"He is not a [[pederast]]. He is not preying on kids.\"<ref name=\"quals\"/>\n\n===Domestic violence===\nArndt is a champion of male victims of [[domestic violence]] who have been abused by women and has said that the \"real picture\" of domestic violence is \"where our official evidence shows at least a third of the victims are male\".<ref name=\"stripped\"/><ref name=\"bring\"/> Arndt is an advocate for the purported statistical claim that \"one in three\" male victims of domestic violence have been abused by women.<ref name=\"no evidence\"/><ref name=\"fiction\"/> Jacinta Masters, from Gender Equity Victoria, says the statistics Arndt uses have \"been roundly dismissed by experts as inaccurate and a misrepresentation\".<ref name=\"no evidence\"/> Australia's National Research Organisation for Women's Safety (ANROWS) says Arndt's \"claims: 1) are inaccurate; and 2) appear to be more focussed on undermining the gains made to address violence against women, than genuine concern for men subjected to violence.\"<ref name=\"anrows\"/> Doctors Against Violence Towards Women (DAVTW) states that Arndt \"has, for many years, been downplaying domestic violence - even in her language, she uses terms like the 'myth of domestic violence' and 'feminist narrative', so while we're trying to highlight it as a problem, she's casting doubt and doing the opposite of that.\"<ref name=\"doctors\"/>\n\nArndt is a critic of domestic violence campaigner [[Rosie Batty]], saying that her campaigning \"denies women's role in family violence\" and that Batty has been \"playing the feminist puppet\".<ref name=\"mumbrella\"/>\n\t\nArndt defended a comment by a Queensland police officer that a man who had killed his wife and children by [[Death by burning|immolation]] may have been a \"husband being driven too far by issues\".<ref name=\"hurtful\"/><ref name=\"examines\"/><ref name=\"reece\"/>\n\n===2018 \"fake rape crisis\" campus tour===\nArndt says that there is a \"manufactured rape crisis\" on Australian university campuses fuelled by the [[Australian Human Rights Commission]], where the institutions convene a \"[[kangaroo court]]\" once an allegation has been made where the male alleged to have raped the female has no chance of defence.<ref name=\"bias\"/> In 2018-2019 she conducted her \"fake rape crisis\" university campus tour where she campaigned against changes to consent laws with her main argument being that rates of sexual harassment and assault on university campuses were being artificially inflated to stoke anti-male sentiment. University women's groups and anti-violence representatives said Arndt's events were \"a misinformed and harmful attempt to undo the work of generations of student activists and advocates in combating the issues of sexual violence on campus\" and that she was \"mocking sexual assault survivors at [universities] around the country\".<ref name=\":2\"/><ref name=\":0\"/><ref name=\":3\"/><ref name=\"heterosexual\"/><ref name=\"campus\"/>\n\nStudents protested her on-campus appearances<ref name=\"heterosexual\" /> and the student [[Sydney University Liberal Club|Liberal Club]] hosted her \"Fake Rape Crisis Campus Tour\" event at [[Sydney University]]. Afterwards Arndt lobbied and petitioned against her protesters in an attempt to have them disciplined. At the time ''[[The Saturday Paper]]'' reported that \"Federal government ministers and conservative media personalities have been quick to praise Arndt as the latest free speech hero threatened by a censorious left-wing culture on university campuses.\"<ref name=\"campus\"/>\n\nArndt's \"Fake Rape Crisis\" university speaking tour was cited in the granting of her 2020 Order of Australia award.<ref name=\":3\" /> When referring to the former federal [[Minister for Women (Australia)|Minister for Women]], [[Kate Ellis]]', advocacy for victims on campus, Arndt stated that \"My campus work poses a direct threat to Ellis' longtime advocacy for victims of sexual assault.\"<ref name=\"storm\"/>\n\n===2020 Order of Australia award===\nArndt was appointed a [[Member of the Order of Australia]] (AM) in the [[2020 Australia Day Honours]] \"for significant service to the community as a social commentator, and to gender equity through advocacy for men\".<ref name=\":3\" /> Among other significant services to the community,<ref name=\"gg\" /> the citation for Arndt's honour from the [[Council for the Order of Australia]] highlights her \"Campus Tour, since 2018\" (known as the \"Fake Rape Crisis\" Campus Tour),<ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\"gg\" /> and for being a contributor to \"[[Jordan Peterson]]'s ''[[Thinkspot]]'', since 2019\" (an anti-censorship website).<ref name=\"thinkspot\" /><ref name=\"gg\" />\n\nArndt's appointment sparked a petition on [[Change.org]] calling for the honour to be revoked and had reached 33,000 signatures within the first week.<ref name=\"removed\"/><ref name=\":1\" /> The award also drew a reaction from prominent Australian women and abuse survivors,<ref name=\"ballarat\"/><ref name=\"survivor\"/> with 2015 [[Australian of the Year]] and domestic violence campaigner Rosie Batty saying she felt \"sickened\" and \"utterly dismayed\" by it.<ref name=\":0\" /> Writer and activist [[Van Badham]] called the granting of the award \"vile\".<ref name=\":1\"/><ref name=\":2\"/> Bester's sexual assault victim, Grace Tame, said that \"I believe that honouring someone who actively defended a paedophile on a public platform is a blatant example of the protracted, systemic moral corruption that still hampers our society.\"<ref name=\":0\" /> Sharna Bremner, from End Rape on Campus Australia, said she also felt sick after hearing of the award to Arndt and to \"see someone like her be rewarded for mocking those people that have been sexually assaulted sends a message that sexual assault doesn't matter in this country, survivors don't matter, it's a huge slap in the face.\"<ref name=\":3\" /> Arndt responded by saying the criticism shows \"the poisonous side of modern feminism and their determination to shut down anyone who challenges the orthodoxy\".<ref name=\"hits back\"/>\n \n[[Victoria (Australia)|Victorian]] attorney-general [[Jill Hennessy (politician)|Jill Hennessy]] wrote to the [[Governor-General of Australia|Governor-General]], [[David Hurley]], urging that Arndt be stripped of the award,<ref name=\"stripped\"/> saying that \"Ms Arndt's views and activities diminish the devastating experiences of victim-survivors of family and sexual violence, promote division and encourage victim-survivors from taking steps to ensure their survival and safety.\"<ref name=\"jill\"/> Doctors Against Violence Towards Women (DAVTW) also called for Arndt's award to be withdrawn. Karen Williams, a psychiatrist from the group, said that \"Being awarded this honour gives her credibility that she doesn't deserve on this subject - she's had some psychological training but never been registered as a health practitioner; she doesn't work or do research in this field.\"<ref name=\"doctors\"/> Also calling for the award to be revoked, Sue Williamson from the [[ADFA|University of New South Wales in Canberra]] noted that the relevant government \"Ordinance enables the Governor-General to revoke an award if the awardee has 'has behaved or acted in a manner that has brought disrepute on the order'\".<ref name=\"disturbing\"/>\n\nIn February 2020, following further controversy surrounding Arndt's comments on a [[Murder of Hannah Clarke|domestic violence quadruple murder-suicide]] in Queensland, Liberal MP Tim Smith wrote to the chairman of the Council of the Order of Australia, [[Shane Stone]], calling for her award to be revoked, the first [[bipartisan]] support for the move. He stated that Arndt's comments brought the Order into disrepute, were inconsistent with the role of the awards in acknowledging the bravery of military personnel, and suggested that \"the Council of the Order of Australia has an important role protecting the Vice-Regal office and the [[Monarchy of Australia|Crown in Australia]] from associating itself with views that seek to make excuses for extreme violence\".<ref name=\"calls grow\"/><ref name=\"crossed\"/> Arndt had said, \"Congratulations to the Queensland police for keeping an open mind and awaiting proper evidence, including the possibility that Rowan Baxter might have been 'driven too far'. But note the misplaced outrage. How dare police deviate from the feminist script of seeking excuses...\"<ref name=\"calls grow\"/> Within days many politicians from Liberal, [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] and the [[Australian Greens|Greens]] were also calling for her award to be revoked,<ref name=\"hurtful\"/><ref name=\"mikakos\"/><ref name=\"federal\"/><ref name=\"geelong\"/><ref name=\"letter\"/><ref name=\"lyons\"/> including the Federal Minister for Women, [[Marise Payne]].<ref name=\"table\"/>\n\nOn 25 February 2020, the [[Australian Senate]] voted overwhelmingly in support of a motion calling for the revocation of Arndt's Order of Australia award, with [[Pauline Hanson]] and [[Malcolm Roberts (politician)|Malcolm Roberts]] being the only senators to vote against the motion. The motion is not binding on the Order of Australia Council.<ref name=\"federal\"/> In response to the Senate vote Arndt said conservative MPs had \"caved in\" to \"feminist power\" and urged her supporters to \"maintain the rage\" and mobilise against what she believes are \"feral mobs trying to take [her] out\" in calling for her AM to be revoked.<ref name=\"urges\"/> Following the bipartisan Senate motion, the Governor-General's secretary Paul Singer told a Senate estimates committee that the Governor-General would not unilaterally revoke the award, \"because in practice the Governor-General does always act on the advice and recommendations of [the Council for the Order of Australia]\". While refusing to comment on Arndt's case specifically, he also noted in relation to past removals that they \"largely attribute to legal proceedings having been exhausted\" and confirmed that some recipients convicted of serious charges retained their awards while still undergoing appeals. ''The Age'' reported that these comments suggested that Arndt \"was unlikely to have her honour rescinded\", given that the reasons argued for revoking Arndt's award were not criminal in nature.<ref name=\"will not\"/>\n\n===Controversy about credentials===\nIn 2020, an article published by the ''[[New Matilda]]'' website pointed out that the media and publishers have frequently misrepresented Arndt as a [[psychologist]], [[clinical psychologist]] or doctor. The back cover of the 2009 edition of her book ''The Sex Diaries'' states that \"Bettina Arndt is a clinical psychologist\" and \"she draws on her thirty-five years of experience as a sex therapist and psychologist\". Arndt, however, is not a registered psychologist, clinical psychologist, [[medical doctor]] or has a [[PhD]] degree. The article criticised Arndt for distributing material containing these misrepresentations without correcting them. In response, Arndt stated that she never described herself in this way, saying that \"I've had a 45-year career. I say I trained as a clinical psychologist, I explain my career, whenever I'm asked to do a [[Curriculum vitae|CV]] or put it out publicly. But people still introduce me in the wrong way.\"<ref name=\"quals\"/> When she began her career, she did not need to register as a psychologist as the registration of psychologists only began with the ''Psychologists Act 1989'' (NSW).<ref name=\"rejects\"/><ref name=\"act\"/> The Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (AHPRA) investigated the allegations detailed in the ''New Matilda'' article<ref name=\"watchdog\"/> and cautioned Arndt over the use of the 'psychologist' title, urging that she act to prevent media outlets from using incorrect titles when referring to her and to refrain from promoting any content in which she is falsely described.<ref name=\"escapes\"/>\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite book |last=Arndt |first=Bettina |title=Female Forum: The Key to Being

Starting as a sex therapist and feminist, she came to public prominence in the 1970s, establishing a career in publishing and broadcasting as well as writing several books. In the last two decades she has abandoned feminism and attracted controversy with her social commentary and her views on sexual abuse, domestic violence and men's rights advocacy.\n\n== Early life ==\nArndt was born in [[Penrith, England]], to the economist [[Heinz Wolfgang Arndt|Heinz Arndt]] (1915 \u2013 6 May 2002) and Ruth (''n\u00e9e'' Strohsahl) (20 March 1915 \u2013 20 March 2001), the youngest of three children.<ref name=\"rats\"/><ref name=\"Talking\"/> Her parents were German, and escaped [[Nazi Germany]] prior to [[WWII]].<ref name=\"father\"/> They emigrated to Australia in 1945 and she grew up in [[Canberra]].<ref name=\"rats\"/><ref name=\"Talking\"/>\n\n== Education ==\nIn 1971, after completing a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree at the [[Australian National University]], Arndt moved to [[Sydney]] and studied at the [[University of New South Wales]] where she completed a [[Master of Psychology]] degree in 1973;<ref name=\"rats\" /><ref name=\"quals\"/> her thesis was on orgasm dysfunction.<ref name=\"gleeson\"/><ref name=\"Overington\"/>\n\n== Family ==\nSince graduating, Arndt has predominantly lived in [[Woollahra]] in the eastern-suburbs of Sydney [[New South Wales]]. She was first married to journalist Dennis Minogue in 1977, who died in 1981. Arndt and Minoque were business partners during this time. Her second marriage was to American corporate lawyer Warren Scott in 1986, and they divorced in 2007. During the years 1986 to 1991 she lived with Scott in the borough of [[Manhattan]] in [[New York City]] NY. Arndt has three children of her own, two girls and one boy.<ref name=\"advocate\"/><ref name=\"rats\"/><ref name=\"sexpert\"/><ref name=\"marries\"/>\n\n== Career ==\nAfter graduation, Arndt practiced as a [[sex therapist]] until 1981.<ref name=\"cv2011\"/> She describes herself as \"one of Australia's first sex therapists\".<ref name=\"stripped\"/>\n\nArndt came to prominence in the 1970s by editing ''Forum'', an Australian adult sex education magazine, which led to frequent radio and television appearances. She was appointed editor in 1974 and remained in the position until July 1982.<ref name=\"advocate\"/> The publication proved controversial in conservative circles, and in [[Queensland Parliament]] in 1977 MP [[Des Frawley]] said: \"It is a dirty, filthy magazine\".<ref name=\"hansard\"/> [[Queensland Police Service|Queensland police]] also raided a newsagent, seizing copies of the magazine, requesting the proprietor [[show cause]].<ref name=\"Talking\"/>\n\nBetween 1973 and 1976 the [[Australian Broadcasting Control Board]] had ruled, without explanation, that all TV and radio programs in which Arndt takes part in be pre-recorded so that they may be approved by station management before being transmitted.<ref name=\"abt\" /><ref name=\"tharunka\" />\n\nIn 1978 Arndt said that \"The sexual revolution has been a [[damp squib]]\" expressing some doubts about what level people were really more sophisticated in their attitudes toward sex. She did acknowledge that the The [[Women's Movement]] had made physiological discoveries about the sexuality of women, that there was more tolerance to one's [[sexual preference]], and there had been a recognition of the importance of sex for [[senior citizens]] and those with [[disabilities]]. Arndt also praised the introduction of [[South Australian]] laws criminalising [[rape]] within marriage.<ref name=\"noisy\"/>\n\nHer work in sex education also involved postgraduate courses, seminars and lectures for groups including doctors and other professionals. Following the death of her husband and business partner, Dennis Minogue, in 1981, ''Forum'' magazine closed.<ref name=\"advocate\" /> In the mid 1980s, Arndt wrote for ''[[Australian Playboy]]''<ref name=\"tharunka\"/> and also wrote about broader social issues for newspapers including ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'' and ''[[The Age]]''. During this period Arndt also had her own radio program on [[2GB]] and regular radio segments in major cities all over Australia. In 1982 she appeared on the TV panel-show series ''[[Beauty and the Beast (talk show)|Beauty and the Beast]]''<ref name=\"beauty\" /> and, from 1981 to 1986, was a weekly guest on television program ''[[Today (Australian TV program)|The Today Show]]''.<ref name=\"cv2011\" />\n\nIn 1984, Arndt ran a mail-order lingerie and sex toy business and authored a number of books on sex advice, including ''The Bettina Arndt Guide to Lovemaking for Women'', in which she wrote that \"Looking at what's happening to men and women in bed today, it wouldn't surprise me at all if more and more males chose to stick to their beer. Sex is fast becoming a battlefield, with women calling more of the shots.\"<ref name=\"gleeson\"/>\n\nIn 1986 Arndt moved to New York City for five years and, while living in the United States, wrote a weekly newspaper column syndicated through ''The Age'' in [[Melbourne]] (and published in Canberra, [[Adelaide]], [[Perth]] and [[Brisbane]]). She had two books published featuring collections of her writings, ''Private Lives'' (1985) and ''All About Us'' (1989).<ref name=\"sexpert\"/> In 1991, Arndt returned with her family to live in Australia.<ref name=\"advocate\"/>\n\nFrom the 1990s onward Arndt wrote a personal advice column for ''[[Cleo (magazine)|Cleo magazine]]'',<ref name=\"cv2011\"/> wrote for ''[[The Bulletin (Australian periodical)|The Bulletin]]'',<ref name=\"Talking\"/> ''[[The Australian]]'' and ''[[The Australian Women's Weekly]]''. She was a guest reporter on ''[[Four Corners (Australian TV program)|Four Corners]]'' on [[ABC TV (Australia)|ABC TV]]<ref name=\"gg\"/> and a regular guest on [[ABC Local Radio|ABC radio]] in Sydney, Melbourne, Canberra and Adelaide.<ref name=\"cv2011\"/> She was on the board of the [[Australian National University]] and was the president of the board of the [[Royal Women's Hospital]] Foundation in 1999. She also served as an online dating coach from 2001 to 2017,<ref name=\"gg\"/> and more recently has assisted men in writing their dating profiles and referring them on to good photographers for their dating profile photos.<ref name=\"could be\"/>\n\nDuring the first half of her career Arndt was a [[feminist]], but since the mid 1990s<ref name=\"gleeson\"/> has turned to men's rights advocacy.<ref name=\"heterosexual\"/><ref name=\"removed\"/><ref name=\"jill\"/> Her later work encapsulated socially conservative ideas about relationships and family structures.<ref name=\"removed\"/><ref name=\"advocate\"/> In 2010, Arndt said, \"I spent my early career lobbying for women but turned to men when I realised how lousy they are about advocating for issues that affect their private lives.\"<ref name=\"Overington\"/> Kate Gleeson, a senior lecturer at [[Macquarie Law School]] who has studied her, says \"Arndt's extolling of men's rights, as well as her critique of feminist analyses of domestic violence, sexual assault, sexual harassment and sex within marriage, has provoked feminist ire in the press\", adding \"To Arndt's frustration, the male revolution she advocated of political reaction against feminism had failed to emerge\".<ref name=\"gleeson\"/>\n\nDuring the conservative [[Howard Government]] (1996-2007) Arndt was brought into the fold as an adviser on issues such as assisted reproduction, education and child support.<ref name=\"gleeson\"/> She served on a number of committees advising the Australian Government on policy matters, including the National Advisory Committee on Ageing (2003), the Assisted Reproductive Technologies Review Team (2005) and the Child Support Review Reference Group (2004).<ref name=\"gg\"/> In 2003 the government awarded her the [[Centenary Medal]], which recognises \"people who made a contribution to Australian society or government.\".<ref name=\"cv2011\"/><ref name=\"centenary-medal\"/> Gleeson observed that at this time Arndt had a \"persistent criticism of matters of [[family law]]\".<ref name=\"gleeson\"/> A government committee she was part of from 2000 to 2001, the Family Law Pathways Advisory Group, was instrumental in later redrafting Australian family law.<ref name=\"gleeson\"/><ref name=\"crossed\"/>\n\nIn 2007, the Australian television program ''[[Media Watch (TV program)|Media Watch]]'' demonstrated that a newspaper article written by Arndt for the ''[[Brisbane Courier Mail]]'' plagiarised large tracts of a ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'' article by [[Dick Taverne]] published three years earlier.<ref name=\"leftovers\"/> The program also accused Arndt of journalistic non-disclosure in a column she wrote for ''The Sydney Morning Herald'' when she identified [[Kerryn Phelps]]'s same-sex marriage to [[Ascham School|Ascham Girls' School]] teacher Jackie Stricker. Arndt failed to disclose that her daughter attended the school and Phelps holds Arndt partly responsible for ending her wife's career there. In her defence Arndt said that \"I've never been anti-gay\", saying she was merely reporting the anxieties of some Ascham parents.<ref name=\"advocate\"/>\n\nArndt wrote ''The Sex Diaries'', based on the diaries of 98 couples talking about how they negotiate sex and deal with mismatched desire. It was published in 2009, followed by ''What Men Want'', another diary project published in September 2010.<ref name=\"advocate\"/><ref name=\"blokes\"/>\n\nIn 2010, ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald#Good Weekend|Good Weekend]]'' said she had repositioned herself as \"a champion of the downtrodden male of the species\", adding that \"In her writing, the former libertine started to sound like a self-appointed guardian of public morals.\" Her friend Merri Southwood said of Arndt's newspaper columns at the time, \"I'm not sure how much of it is the author seeking an audience and how much is the genuine Bettina ... Because, in fact, the way she writes is sometimes a little at odds with her own personal life.\"<ref name=\"advocate\"/>\n\nIn 2020 Arndt's previously good relationship with political conservatives and the conservative media shifted. ''Media Watch'' reported that \"Arndt has been in the media for more than 40 years and has written for many of Australia's leading papers and magazines as sex therapist, [[social commentator]] and, most recently, outspoken men's rights advocate\". But her comments on the [[murder of Hannah Clarke]] incident in 2020 had since led to near universal condemnation in the media, including those she had previously worked with. ''Media Watch'' questioned whether or not they would use her again in the future.<ref name=\"condemned\"/> When questioned about Arndt's time advising the Howard Government (1996-2007), Victorian [[Liberal Party of Australia|Liberal]] shadow minister [[Tim Smith (Australian politician)|Tim Smith]] said: \"I think Bettina Arndt has become more extreme as the years have gone by. I don't think she was nearly this extreme during the Howard Government years. I think some of her commentary of recent years has gone beyond mainstream Australia to the fringes.\"<ref name=\"crossed\"/> [[News Corp Australia|News Corp's]] [[David Penberthy]] lamented the loss of the Arndt of the 70s and 80s when she was a sex therapist and a \"fun person... trying to make couples happier through sex\", saying she seems to have now \"herded all of the really angry guys in Australia into the one corner and has, sort of, created almost a business model out of it\".<ref name=\"storm\"/>\n\n===Men's rights activism===\nArndt has now been termed a [[men's rights activist]],<ref name=\":2\"/><ref name=\"hurtful\"/><ref name=\"removed\"/><ref name=\"jill\"/> and says \"we need to start calling out feminism which is a really destructive force in our society\".<ref name=\"condemned\"/> She believes there is a pervasive \"anti-male bias\" in society, media and the law - also extending into in areas such as divorce, cancer research and domestic violence - saying that women are prioritised, thus denying men their rights.<ref name=\"toxic\"/> In 2012, [[Janet Albrechtsen|Albrechtsen]] wrote that Arndt \"now argues that with women dominating public discussion of gender and sexual issues, men's views are being silenced\".<ref name=\"Albrechtsen\"/> Arndt argues that \"[[radical feminism]], where men are presented as violent and sexist, is guilty of manshaming and destroying what should be a bond of mutual acceptance and respect between the sexes\".<ref name=\"toxic\"/> Arndt has been accused of being hostile towards women.<ref name=\"storm\"/><ref name=\"hurtful\"/> Author [[Susan Maushart]] says that Arndt \"seems, for whatever reason, to not like women very much\".<ref name=\"advocate\"/>\n\n===On partnerships and parenting===\nWhen Australia's first female prime minister, [[Julia Gillard]] (Labor), was elected in 2010, Arndt criticised the new prime minister for setting a bad example by living in a [[Common-law marriage|de facto]] relationship, or as Arndt described it \"marriage lite\".<ref name=\"gleeson\"/>\n\nArndt has been criticised for dismissing genuine academic research when writing about the children of [[LGBTIQ]] parents. Ex Federal Senator [[Brian Greig]] denounced Arndt for using \"the work of 'researchers' with strong links to the American religious right\" when discussing [[same-sex parenting]], saying she should have been \"able to distinguish such research from sham, politically motivated studies.\"<ref name=\"qnews\"/>\n\n===Comments about sexual abuse===\nArndt has drawn controversy over several incidents in which she has been accused of downplaying the [[sexual abuse]] of children by adults.\n\nShe has suggested that rape is not always violent and has said that most children do not incur long-term damage from sexual assault.<ref name=\"silence\"/>\n\nIn 1997, Arndt defended a doctor who had molested a 12-year-old child and other patients including herself,<ref name=\"victimhood\"/> arguing that he should not be charged because in another context masturbation would have been \"a loving and pleasurable act\".<ref name=\":0\"/>\n\nIn 2005, in an article in ''[[The Courier-Mail]]'', Arndt discussed convicted [[paedophile]] Robert Potter, a scoutmaster who had molested four boys, one of whom subsequently attempted suicide. She described Potter as \"a good bloke\"<ref name=\"victimhood\"/> and argued that \"such minor abuse rarely has lasting consequences\".<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn a 2012 article she wrote that \"Demonising sexuality inevitably distorts a proper perspective on sexual crimes, leading to politically inspired calls for absurdly longer sentences, misinformation about the likelihood of offenders to reoffend and exaggeration of the emotional damage to the victims of minor abuse\" and that \"Our prurient interest in sex crimes often robs the perpetrator of any chance of redemption - as the sad death of cricket commentator [[Peter Roebuck]] bears witness.\"<ref name=\"prudes\"/>\n \nIn 2017, Arndt conducted a 17-minute interview for her YouTube channel with Nicolaas Bester, a high school teacher in [[Tasmania]] who in 2011 was sentenced to two years and 10 months jail for sexual assault,<ref name=\"urges\" /> maintaining a sexual relationship with a 15-year-old student<ref name=\"jailed\"/> and possessing child pornography.<ref name=\"ironic\"/> He was subsequently jailed again for producing child exploitation material<ref name=\"awesome\"/><ref name=\"silent\"/> and bragging that the sexual abuse had been \"awesome\".<ref name=\"hits back\"/> In the video, Arndt referred to \"sexually provocative behaviour from female students\" and said young women should \"behave sensibly and not exploit their seductive power to ruin the lives of men\". Bester's victim subsequently criticised Arndt for supporting Bester and accusing her of trivialising his crime,<ref name=\"arndt awarded\"/> saying there \"was no evidence of my provocative behaviour\". \"Not only is the interview disturbing because it gives a platform to a paedophile. It's not a truthful interview.\"<ref name=\"survivor\"/> Arndt was criticised for not seeking out the victim for her side of the story.<ref name=\"4bc\"/><ref name=\"ironic\" /> Following widespread public outrage, Arndt apologised for her tone and said her interview was in poor taste, but in a later interview said of Bester that \"He is not a [[pederast]]. He is not preying on kids.\"<ref name=\"quals\"/>\n\n===Domestic violence===\nArndt is a champion of male victims of [[domestic violence]] who have been abused by women and has said that the \"real picture\" of domestic violence is \"where our official evidence shows at least a third of the victims are male\".<ref name=\"stripped\"/><ref name=\"bring\"/> Arndt is an advocate for the purported statistical claim that \"one in three\" male victims of domestic violence have been abused by women.<ref name=\"no evidence\"/><ref name=\"fiction\"/> Jacinta Masters, from Gender Equity Victoria, says the statistics Arndt uses have \"been roundly dismissed by experts as inaccurate and a misrepresentation\".<ref name=\"no evidence\"/> Australia's National Research Organisation for Women's Safety (ANROWS) says Arndt's \"claims: 1) are inaccurate; and 2) appear to be more focussed on undermining the gains made to address violence against women, than genuine concern for men subjected to violence.\"<ref name=\"anrows\"/> Doctors Against Violence Towards Women (DAVTW) states that Arndt \"has, for many years, been downplaying domestic violence - even in her language, she uses terms like the 'myth of domestic violence' and 'feminist narrative', so while we're trying to highlight it as a problem, she's casting doubt and doing the opposite of that.\"<ref name=\"doctors\"/>\n\nArndt is a critic of domestic violence campaigner [[Rosie Batty]], saying that her campaigning \"denies women's role in family violence\" and that Batty has been \"playing the feminist puppet\".<ref name=\"mumbrella\"/>\n\t\nArndt defended a comment by a Queensland police officer that a man who had killed his wife and children by [[Death by burning|immolation]] may have been a \"husband being driven too far by issues\".<ref name=\"hurtful\"/><ref name=\"examines\"/><ref name=\"reece\"/>\n\n===2018 \"fake rape crisis\" campus tour===\nArndt says that there is a \"manufactured rape crisis\" on Australian university campuses fuelled by the [[Australian Human Rights Commission]], where the institutions convene a \"[[kangaroo court]]\" once an allegation has been made where the male alleged to have raped the female has no chance of defence.<ref name=\"bias\"/> In 2018-2019 she conducted her \"fake rape crisis\" university campus tour where she campaigned against changes to consent laws with her main argument being that rates of sexual harassment and assault on university campuses were being artificially inflated to stoke anti-male sentiment. University women's groups and anti-violence representatives said Arndt's events were \"a misinformed and harmful attempt to undo the work of generations of student activists and advocates in combating the issues of sexual violence on campus\" and that she was \"mocking sexual assault survivors at [universities] around the country\".<ref name=\":2\"/><ref name=\":0\"/><ref name=\":3\"/><ref name=\"heterosexual\"/><ref name=\"campus\"/>\n\nStudents protested her on-campus appearances<ref name=\"heterosexual\" /> and the student [[Sydney University Liberal Club|Liberal Club]] hosted her \"Fake Rape Crisis Campus Tour\" event at [[Sydney University]]. Afterwards Arndt lobbied and petitioned against her protesters in an attempt to have them disciplined. At the time ''[[The Saturday Paper]]'' reported that \"Federal government ministers and conservative media personalities have been quick to praise Arndt as the latest free speech hero threatened by a censorious left-wing culture on university campuses.\"<ref name=\"campus\"/>\n\nArndt's \"Fake Rape Crisis\" university speaking tour was cited in the granting of her 2020 Order of Australia award.<ref name=\":3\" /> When referring to the former federal [[Minister for Women (Australia)|Minister for Women]], [[Kate Ellis]]', advocacy for victims on campus, Arndt stated that \"My campus work poses a direct threat to Ellis' longtime advocacy for victims of sexual assault.\"<ref name=\"storm\"/>\n\n===2020 Order of Australia award===\nArndt was appointed a [[Member of the Order of Australia]] (AM) in the [[2020 Australia Day Honours]] \"for significant service to the community as a social commentator, and to gender equity through advocacy for men\".<ref name=\":3\" /> Among other significant services to the community,<ref name=\"gg\" /> the citation for Arndt's honour from the [[Council for the Order of Australia]] highlights her \"Campus Tour, since 2018\" (known as the \"Fake Rape Crisis\" Campus Tour),<ref name=\":3\" /><ref name=\"gg\" /> and for being a contributor to \"[[Jordan Peterson]]'s ''[[Thinkspot]]'', since 2019\" (an anti-censorship website).<ref name=\"thinkspot\" /><ref name=\"gg\" />\n\nArndt's appointment sparked a petition on [[Change.org]] calling for the honour to be revoked and had reached 33,000 signatures within the first week.<ref name=\"removed\"/><ref name=\":1\" /> The award also drew a reaction from prominent Australian women and abuse survivors,<ref name=\"ballarat\"/><ref name=\"survivor\"/> with 2015 [[Australian of the Year]] and domestic violence campaigner Rosie Batty saying she felt \"sickened\" and \"utterly dismayed\" by it.<ref name=\":0\" /> Writer and activist [[Van Badham]] called the granting of the award \"vile\".<ref name=\":1\"/><ref name=\":2\"/> Bester's sexual assault victim, Grace Tame, said that \"I believe that honouring someone who actively defended a paedophile on a public platform is a blatant example of the protracted, systemic moral corruption that still hampers our society.\"<ref name=\":0\" /> Sharna Bremner, from End Rape on Campus Australia, said she also felt sick after hearing of the award to Arndt and to \"see someone like her be rewarded for mocking those people that have been sexually assaulted sends a message that sexual assault doesn't matter in this country, survivors don't matter, it's a huge slap in the face.\"<ref name=\":3\" /> Arndt responded by saying the criticism shows \"the poisonous side of modern feminism and their determination to shut down anyone who challenges the orthodoxy\".<ref name=\"hits back\"/>\n \n[[Victoria (Australia)|Victorian]] attorney-general [[Jill Hennessy (politician)|Jill Hennessy]] wrote to the [[Governor-General of Australia|Governor-General]], [[David Hurley]], urging that Arndt be stripped of the award,<ref name=\"stripped\"/> saying that \"Ms Arndt's views and activities diminish the devastating experiences of victim-survivors of family and sexual violence, promote division and encourage victim-survivors from taking steps to ensure their survival and safety.\"<ref name=\"jill\"/> Doctors Against Violence Towards Women (DAVTW) also called for Arndt's award to be withdrawn. Karen Williams, a psychiatrist from the group, said that \"Being awarded this honour gives her credibility that she doesn't deserve on this subject - she's had some psychological training but never been registered as a health practitioner; she doesn't work or do research in this field.\"<ref name=\"doctors\"/> Also calling for the award to be revoked, Sue Williamson from the [[ADFA|University of New South Wales in Canberra]] noted that the relevant government \"Ordinance enables the Governor-General to revoke an award if the awardee has 'has behaved or acted in a manner that has brought disrepute on the order'\".<ref name=\"disturbing\"/>\n\nIn February 2020, following further controversy surrounding Arndt's comments on a [[Murder of Hannah Clarke|domestic violence quadruple murder-suicide]] in Queensland, Liberal MP Tim Smith wrote to the chairman of the Council of the Order of Australia, [[Shane Stone]], calling for her award to be revoked, the first [[bipartisan]] support for the move. He stated that Arndt's comments brought the Order into disrepute, were inconsistent with the role of the awards in acknowledging the bravery of military personnel, and suggested that \"the Council of the Order of Australia has an important role protecting the Vice-Regal office and the [[Monarchy of Australia|Crown in Australia]] from associating itself with views that seek to make excuses for extreme violence\".<ref name=\"calls grow\"/><ref name=\"crossed\"/> Arndt had said, \"Congratulations to the Queensland police for keeping an open mind and awaiting proper evidence, including the possibility that Rowan Baxter might have been 'driven too far'. But note the misplaced outrage. How dare police deviate from the feminist script of seeking excuses...\"<ref name=\"calls grow\"/> Within days many politicians from Liberal, [[Australian Labor Party|Labor]] and the [[Australian Greens|Greens]] were also calling for her award to be revoked,<ref name=\"hurtful\"/><ref name=\"mikakos\"/><ref name=\"federal\"/><ref name=\"geelong\"/><ref name=\"letter\"/><ref name=\"lyons\"/> including the Federal Minister for Women, [[Marise Payne]].<ref name=\"table\"/>\n\nOn 25 February 2020, the [[Australian Senate]] voted overwhelmingly in support of a motion calling for the revocation of Arndt's Order of Australia award, with [[Pauline Hanson]] and [[Malcolm Roberts (politician)|Malcolm Roberts]] being the only senators to vote against the motion. The motion is not binding on the Order of Australia Council.<ref name=\"federal\"/> In response to the Senate vote Arndt said conservative MPs had \"caved in\" to \"feminist power\" and urged her supporters to \"maintain the rage\" and mobilise against what she believes are \"feral mobs trying to take [her] out\" in calling for her AM to be revoked.<ref name=\"urges\"/> Following the bipartisan Senate motion, the Governor-General's secretary Paul Singer told a Senate estimates committee that the Governor-General would not unilaterally revoke the award, \"because in practice the Governor-General does always act on the advice and recommendations of [the Council for the Order of Australia]\". While refusing to comment on Arndt's case specifically, he also noted in relation to past removals that they \"largely attribute to legal proceedings having been exhausted\" and confirmed that some recipients convicted of serious charges retained their awards while still undergoing appeals. ''The Age'' reported that these comments suggested that Arndt \"was unlikely to have her honour rescinded\", given that the reasons argued for revoking Arndt's award were not criminal in nature.<ref name=\"will not\"/>\n\n===Controversy about credentials===\nIn 2020, an article published by the ''[[New Matilda]]'' website pointed out that the media and publishers have frequently misrepresented Arndt as a [[psychologist]], [[clinical psychologist]] or doctor. The back cover of the 2009 edition of her book ''The Sex Diaries'' states that \"Bettina Arndt is a clinical psychologist\" and \"she draws on her thirty-five years of experience as a sex therapist and psychologist\". Arndt, however, is not a registered psychologist, clinical psychologist, [[medical doctor]] or has a [[PhD]] degree. The article criticised Arndt for distributing material containing these misrepresentations without correcting them. In response, Arndt stated that she never described herself in this way, saying that \"I've had a 45-year career. I say I trained as a clinical psychologist, I explain my career, whenever I'm asked to do a [[Curriculum vitae|CV]] or put it out publicly. But people still introduce me in the wrong way.\"<ref name=\"quals\"/> When she began her career, she did not need to register as a psychologist as the registration of psychologists only began with the ''Psychologists Act 1989'' (NSW).<ref name=\"rejects\"/><ref name=\"act\"/> The Australian Health Practitioner Regulation Agency (AHPRA) investigated the allegations detailed in the ''New Matilda'' article<ref name=\"watchdog\"/> and cautioned Arndt over the use of the 'psychologist' title, urging that she act to prevent media outlets from using incorrect titles when referring to her and to refrain from promoting any content in which she is falsely described.<ref name=\"escapes\"/>\n\n==Bibliography==\n* {{cite book |last=Arndt |first=Bettina |title=Female Forum: The Key to Being
