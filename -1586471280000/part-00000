Docker is located 4.3 miles North West of the market town of [[Kendal]] in Cumbria.\n\nIn 1870\u20131872, John Marius Wilson's from the [[Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales]] described Docker as: \"a township in Kendal parish, Westmoreland; near the river Mint and the Lancaster and Carlisle railway 3 miles ENE of Kendal\"<ref>{{cite book|last1=Wilson|first1=John Marius|title=Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales|date=1870|publisher=A.

CW2 18, 161\u201373). Whalley also refers to \"''the same problematic syllable in [[Dockray]] and ... Dockray Nook''\" (NY3921 & NY0820).\n\n==Population statistics==\nThe population in 2001 was 55. By the next census in 2011, the population for the parish had more than quadrupled. The population fluctuations in Docker can be seen in the graph showing the census data every 10 years since 1801. There was no census taken in 1941. This is most likely to have been down to a change in the boundaries of the Parish. It may have been thought having a parish with a population of 55 was not significant enough and as a result the council may have changed the boundaries to even out the distribution. The population in 2011 is the highest it has ever been since records began in 1801.\n\nThe male population for Docker was slightly higher than the female population according to the 2011 census.

CW2 18, 161\u201373). Whalley also refers to \"''the same problematic syllable in [[Dockray]] and ... Dockray Nook''\" (NY3921 & NY0820).\n\n==Population statistics==\nThe population in 2001 was 55. By the next census in 2011, the population for the parish had more than quadrupled. The population fluctuations in Docker can be seen in the graph showing the census data every 10 years since 1801. There was no census taken in 1941. This is most likely to have been down to a change in the boundaries of the Parish. It may have been thought having a parish with a population of 55 was not significant enough and as a result the council may have changed the boundaries to even out the distribution. The population in 2011 is the highest it has ever been since records began in 1801.\n\nThe male population for Docker was slightly higher than the female population according to the 2011 census.

In language typology, it has many features divergent from most European languages. Its phrases are exclusively [[head-final]] and compound sentences are exclusively left-[[branching (linguistics)|branching]].<ref>In contrast, [[Romance languages]] such as [[Spanish language|Spanish]] are strongly right-branching, and [[Germanic languages]] such as [[English language|English]] are weakly right-branching</ref> There are many [[subject\u2013object\u2013verb|such languages]], but few among [[European languages]]. It is a [[topic-prominent language]].\n\n==Some distinctive aspects of modern Japanese sentence structure==\n\n===Word order: head final and left branching===\nThe modern theory of constituent order (\"word order\"), usually attributed to [[Joseph Greenberg]], identifies several kinds of phrases. Each one has a '''head''' and possibly a modifier. The head of a phrase either precedes its modifier (head initial) or follows it (head final). Some of these phrase types, with the head marked in boldface, are:\n*genitive phrase, i.e., noun modified by another noun (\"the '''cover''' of the book\", \"the book's '''cover'''\");\n*noun governed by an [[Preposition and postposition|adposition]] (\"'''on''' the table\", \"'''underneath''' the table\");\n*comparison (\"[X is] '''bigger''' than Y\", i.e., \"compared to Y, X is '''big'''\").\n*noun modified by an adjective (\"black '''cat'''\").\n\nSome languages are inconsistent in constituent order, having a mixture of head initial phrase types and head final phrase types. Looking at the preceding list, English for example is mostly head initial, but nouns ''follow'' the adjectives which modify them. Moreover, genitive phrases can be either head initial or head final in English. Japanese, by contrast, is the epitome of a head final language:\n*genitive phrase: \"{{lang|ja|\u732b\u306e'''\u8272'''}}\" ({{transl|ja|neko no '''iro'''}}), cat GEN color = \"the cat's ({{transl|ja|neko no}}) '''color''' ({{transl|ja|iro}})\";\n*noun governed by an ''adposition'':{{lang|ja|\u65e5\u672c'''\u306b'''}} ({{transl|ja|nihon '''ni'''}}), Japan in = \"'''in''' Japan\";\n*comparison: \"{{lang|ja|Y\u3088\u308a'''\u5927\u304d\u3044'''}}\" (Y {{transl|ja|yori '''ookii'''}}), Y than big = \"'''big'''ger than Y\";\n*noun modified by an adjective: \"{{lang|ja|\u9ed2\u3044'''\u732b'''}}\" ({{transl|ja|kuroi '''neko'''}}) = \"black '''cat'''\".\n\nHead finality in Japanese sentence structure carries over to the building of sentences using other sentences. In sentences that have other sentences as constituents, the subordinated sentences (relative clauses, for example), always ''precede'' what they refer to, since they are modifiers and what they modify has the syntactic status of phrasal head.  Translating the phrase ''the man who was walking down the street'' into Japanese word order would be ''street down walking was man''. (Note that Japanese has no articles, and the different word order obviates any need for the relative pronoun ''who''.)\n\nHead finality prevails also when sentences are coordinated instead of subordinated. In the world's languages, it is common to avoid repetition between coordinated clauses by optionally deleting a constituent common to the two parts, as in ''Bob bought his mother some flowers and his father a tie'', where the second ''bought'' is omitted. In Japanese, such \"gapping\" must precede in the reverse order: ''Bob mother for some flowers and father for tie bought''. The reason for this is that in Japanese, sentences (other than occasional inverted sentences or sentences containing afterthoughts) always end in a verb (or other predicative words like adjectival verbs, adjectival nouns, auxiliary verbs)\u2014the only exceptions being a few sentence-ending particles such as ''ka'', ''ne'', and ''yo''. The particle ''ka'' turns a statement into a question, while the others express the speaker's attitude towards the statement.\n\n===Word class system===\nJapanese has five major '''lexical''' [[word class]]es:\n*nouns\n*verbal nouns (correspond to English gerunds like 'studying', 'jumping', which denote activities)\n*nominal adjectives (names vary, also called ''na''-adjectives or \"adjectival nouns\")\n*verbs\n*adjectives (so-called ''i''-adjectives)\nMore broadly, there are two classes: uninflectable (nouns, including verbal nouns and adjectival nouns) and inflectable (verbs, with adjectives as [[defective verb]]s). To be precise, a verbal noun is simply a noun to which {{Nihongo||\u3059\u308b|suru|\"do\"}} can be appended, while an adjectival noun is like a noun but uses {{Nihongo||\u301c\u306a|-na}} instead of {{Nihongo||\u301c\u306e|-no}} when acting attributively. Adjectives (''i''-adjectives) inflect identically to the negative form of verbs, which end in {{Nihongo||\u306a\u3044|na-i}}. Compare {{Nihongo||\u98df\u3079\u306a\u3044|tabe-na-i|don't eat}} \u2192 {{Nihongo||\u98df\u3079\u306a\u304b\u3063\u305f|tabe-na-katta|didn't eat}} and {{Nihongo||\u71b1\u3044|atsu-i|is hot}} \u2192 {{Nihongo||\u71b1\u304b\u3063\u305f|atsu-katta|was hot}}.\n\nSome scholars, such as [[Eleanor Harz Jorden]], refer to adjectives instead as '''adjectivals''', since they are grammatically distinct from adjectives: they can [[Predicate (grammar)|predicate]] a sentence. That is, {{Nihongo||\u71b1\u3044|atsui}} is glossed as \"hot\" when modifying a noun phrase, as in {{Nihongo||\u71b1\u3044\u3054\u98ef|atsui gohan|hot food}}, but as \"''is'' hot\" when predicating, as in {{Nihongo||\u3054\u98ef\u306f\u71b1\u3044|gohan wa atsui|[the] food is hot}}.\n\nThe two [[inflection|inflected]] classes, verb and adjective, are [[closed class]]es, meaning they do not readily gain new members.<ref>[[#Uehara|Uehara]], p. 69</ref>{{sfn|Dixon|1977|p=48}} Instead, new and borrowed verbs and adjectives are conjugated [[periphrasis|periphrastically]] as verbal noun + ''suru'' (e.g. {{Nihongo||\u52c9\u5f37\u3059\u308b|benky\u014d suru|do studying; study}}) and adjectival noun + ''na''. This differs from [[Indo-European languages]], where verbs and adjectives are [[Open class (linguistics)|open classes]], though analogous \"do\" constructions exist, including English \"do a favor\", \"do the twist\" or French \"faire un footing\" (do a \"footing\", go for a jog), and periphrastic constructions are common for other senses, like \"try climbing\" (verbal noun) or \"try parkour\" (noun). Other languages where verbs are a closed class include [[Basque language|Basque]]: new [[Basque verbs]] are only formed periphrastically.

Aikhenvald, [https://books.google.com/books?id=XFBVBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA96 p. 96]</ref> Some believe this is due to a grammatical change of inflection from an aspect system to a tense system, with adjectives predating the change.\n\nThe [[Grammatical conjugation|conjugation]] of ''i''-adjectives has similarities to the conjugation of verbs, unlike Western languages where inflection of adjectives, where it exists, is more likely to have similarities to the [[declension]] of nouns. Verbs and adjectives being closely related is unusual from the perspective of English, but is a common case across languages generally, and one may consider Japanese adjectives as a kind of [[stative verb]].\n\nJapanese vocabulary has a large layer of [[Sino-Japanese vocabulary|Chinese loanwords]], nearly all of which go back more than one thousand years, yet virtually none of them are verbs or \"''i''-adjectives\" \u2013 they are all nouns, of which some are verbal nouns (''suru'') and some are adjectival nouns (''na''). In addition to the basic verbal noun + ''suru'' form, verbal nouns with a single-character root often experienced sound changes, such as {{Nihongo||\u301c\u3059\u308b|-suru}} \u2192 {{Nihongo||\u301c\u305a\u308b|-zuru}} \u2192 {{Nihongo||\u301c\u3058\u308b|-jiru}}, as in {{Nihongo||\u7981\u3058\u308b|kin-jiru|forbid}}, and some cases where the stem underwent sound change, as in {{Nihongo||\u9054\u3059\u308b|tassuru|reach}}, from {{Nihongo||\u9054|tatsu}}.\n\nVerbal nouns are uncontroversially nouns, having only minor syntactic differences to distinguish them from pure nouns like 'mountain'. There are some minor distinctions within verbal nouns, most notably that some primarily conjugate as {{Nihongo||\u301c\u3092\u3059\u308b|-wo suru}} (with a particle), more like nouns, while others primarily conjugate as {{Nihongo||\u301c\u3059\u308b|-suru}}, and others are common either way. For example, {{Nihongo||\u7d4c\u9a13\u3092\u3059\u308b|keiken wo suru|to experience}} is much more common than {{Nihongo||\u7d4c\u9a13\u3059\u308b|keiken suru}}, while {{Nihongo||\u52d8\u5f01\u3059\u308b|kanben suru|to pardon}} is much more common than {{Nihongo||\u52d8\u5f01\u3092\u3059\u308b|kanben wo suru}}.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://aveneca.com/cbb/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=3855 |title=Closed and open classes in Natlangs (Especially Japanese) |access-date=February 22, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150222070657/http://aveneca.com/cbb/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=3855 |archive-date=February 22, 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Nominal adjectives have more syntactic differences versus pure nouns, and traditionally were considered more separate, but they, too, are ultimately a subcategory of nouns.\n\nThere are a few minor word classes that are related to adjectival nouns, namely the [[taru adjective|''taru'' adjectives]] and [[naru adjective|''naru'' adjectives]]. Of these, ''naru'' adjectives are fossils of earlier forms of ''na'' adjectives (the ''nari'' adjectives of Old Japanese), and are typically classed separately, while ''taru'' adjectives are a parallel class (formerly ''tari'' adjectives in Late Old Japanese), but are typically classed with ''na'' adjectives.\n\n===Japanese as a topic-prominent language===\nIn [[discourse]] [[pragmatics]], the term ''topic'' refers to what a section of discourse is about. At the beginning of a section of discourse, the topic is usually unknown, in which case it is usually necessary to explicitly mention it. As the discourse carries on, the topic need not be the grammatical subject of each new sentence.\n\nStarting with Middle Japanese, the grammar evolved so as to explicitly distinguish topics from nontopics. This is done by two distinct [[Japanese particles|particles]] (short words which do not change form). Consider the following pair of sentences:\n:\u592a\u967d'''\u304c'''\u6607\u308b\u3002\n:''taiy\u014d ''ga'' noboru''\n:sun <small>NONTOPIC</small> rise\n:\u592a\u967d'''\u306f'''\u6607\u308b\u3002\n:''taiy\u014d ''wa'' noboru''\n:sun <small>TOPIC</small> rise\nBoth sentences translate as \"the sun rises\". In the first sentence the sun (\u592a\u967d ''taiy\u014d'') is not a discourse topic\u2014not yet; in the second sentence it now ''is'' a discourse topic. In linguistics (specifically, in discourse pragmatics) a sentence such as the second one (with ''wa'') is termed a '''presentational''' sentence because its function in the discourse is to present ''sun'' as a topic, to \"broach it for discussion\". Once a [[referent]] has been established as the topic of the current monolog or dialog, then in (formal) modern Japanese its marking will change from ''ga'' to ''wa''. To better explain the difference, the translation of the second sentence can be enlarged to \"As for the sun, it rises\" or \"Speaking of the sun, it rises\"; these renderings reflect a discourse fragment in which \"the sun\" is being established as the topic of an extended discussion.\n\n===Liberal omission of the subject of a sentence===\nThe grammatical [[Subject (grammar)|subject]] is [[null-subject language|commonly omitted]] in Japanese, as in\n:\u65e5\u672c\u306b\u884c\u304d\u307e\u3057\u305f\n:''nihon ni ikimashita''\n:Japan <small>LATIVE</small> go-<small>POLITE</small>-<small>PERFECT</small>\nThe sentence literally expresses \"went to Japan\". Subjects are mentioned when a topic is introduced, or in situations where an ambiguity might result from their omission. The preceding example sentence would most likely be uttered in the middle of a discourse, where who it is that \"went to Japan\" will be clear from what has already been said (or written).\n\n==Sentences, phrases and words==\n''Text'' (\u6587\u7ae0 ''bunsh\u014d'') is composed of ''[[Sentence (linguistics)|sentences]]'' (\u6587 ''bun''), which are in turn composed of ''[[phrase]]s'' (\u6587\u7bc0 ''bunsetsu''), which are its smallest coherent components. Like [[Chinese language|Chinese]] and classical [[Korean language|Korean]], written Japanese does not typically demarcate words with spaces; its agglutinative nature further makes the concept of a ''[[word]]'' rather different from words in [[English language|English]]. The reader identifies word divisions by semantic cues and a knowledge of phrase structure. Phrases have a ''single'' meaning-bearing word, followed by a string of [[suffix]]es, [[auxiliary verb]]s and [[Grammatical particle|particles]] to modify its meaning and designate its grammatical role. In the following example, phrases are indicated by vertical bars:\n:\u592a\u967d\u304c\uff5c\u6771\u306e\uff5c\u7a7a\u306b\uff5c\u6607\u308b\u3002\n:''taiy\u014d ga'' | ''higashi no'' | ''sora ni'' | ''noboru''\n:sun <small>SUBJECT</small> | east <small>POSSESSIVE</small> | sky <small>LOCATIVE</small> | rise\n:The sun rises in the eastern sky.\n\nSome scholars [[Romanization|romanize]] Japanese sentences by inserting spaces only at phrase boundaries (''i.e.'', \"''taiy\u014d-ga higashi-no sora-ni noboru''\"), treating an entire phrase as a single word. This represents an almost purely phonological conception of where one word ends and the next begins. There is some validity in taking this approach: [[phonology|phonologically]], the [[Preposition and postposition|postpositional]] particles [[Clitic|merge with the structural word that precedes them]], and within a ''phonological'' phrase, the [[Japanese pitch accent|pitch]] can have at most one fall. Usually, however, grammarians adopt a more conventional concept of ''word'' (\u5358\u8a9e ''tango''), one which invokes meaning and sentence structure.\n\n==Word classification==\nIn linguistics generally, words and affixes are often classified into two major word categories: [[lexical word|'''lexical''' words]], those that refer to the world outside of a discourse, and [[function word|'''function''' words]]\u2014also including fragments of words\u2014which help to build the sentence in accordance with the grammar rules of the language. Lexical words include nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, and sometimes prepositions and postpositions, while grammatical words or word parts include everything else. The native tradition in Japanese grammar scholarship seems to concur in this view of classification. This native Japanese tradition uses the terminology {{Nihongo||\u81ea\u7acb\u8a9e|jiritsugo|extra=\u201cindependent words\u201d}}, for words having lexical meaning, and {{Nihongo||\u4ed8\u5c5e\u8a9e|fuzokugo|extra=\u201cauxiliary words\u201d}}, for words having a grammatical function.\n\nClassical Japanese had some auxiliary verbs (i.e., they were independent words) which have become grammaticized in modern Japanese as inflectional suffixes, such as the past tense suffix ''-ta'' (which might have developed as a contraction of ''-te ari'').\n\nTraditional scholarship proposes a system of word classes differing somewhat from the above-mentioned.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} The \"independent\" words have the following categories.\n:{{Nihongo||\u6d3b\u7528\u8a9e|katsuy\u014dgo}}, word classes which have inflections\n::{{Nihongo||\u52d5\u8a5e|d\u014dshi}}, verbs,\n::{{Nihongo||\u5f62\u5bb9\u8a5e|keiy\u014dshi}}, ''i''-type adjectives.\n::{{Nihongo||\u5f62\u5bb9\u52d5\u8a5e|keiy\u014dd\u014dshi}}, ''na''-type adjectives\n\n:{{Nihongo||\u975e\u6d3b\u7528\u8a9e|hikatsuy\u014dgo}} or {{Nihongo||mukatsuy\u014dgo|\u7121\u6d3b\u7528\u8a9e}}, word classes which do not have inflections{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}\n::{{Nihongo||\u540d\u8a5e|meishi}}, nouns\n::{{Nihongo||\u4ee3\u540d\u8a5e|daimeishi}}, pronouns\n::{{Nihongo||\u526f\u8a5e|fukushi}}, adverbs\n::{{Nihongo||\u63a5\u7d9a\u8a5e|setsuzokushi}}, conjunctions\n::{{Nihongo||\u611f\u52d5\u8a5e|kand\u014dshi}}, interjections\n::{{Nihongo||\u9023\u4f53\u8a5e|rentaishi}}, prenominals\n\nAncillary words also divide into a nonconjugable class, containing  grammatical particles (\u52a9\u8a5e ''joshi'') and [[Japanese counter word|counter words]] (\u52a9\u6570\u8a5e ''jos\u016bshi''), and a conjugable class consisting of auxiliary verbs (\u52a9\u52d5\u8a5e ''jod\u014dshi''). There is not wide agreement among linguists as to the English translations of the above terms.\n\n===Controversy over the characterization of nominal adjectives===\nUehara (1998)<ref>[[#Uehara|Uehara]], chapter 2, especially \u00a72.2.2.2</ref> observes that Japanese grammarians have disagreed as to the criteria that make some words \"inflectional\", ''katsuy\u014d'', and others not, in particular, the \u5f62\u5bb9\u52d5\u8a5e   ''keiy\u014dd\u014dshi'' \u2013 \"''na''-adjectives\" or \"''na''-nominals\". (It is not disputed that nouns like 'book' and 'mountain' are noninflectional and that verbs and ''i''-adjectives are inflectional.) The claim that ''na''-adjectives are inflectional rests on the claim that the syllable ''da'' 'is', usually regarded as a \"copula verb\", is really a suffix\u2014an inflection. Thus ''hon'' 'book', generates a one-word sentence, ''honda'' 'it is a book', not a two-word sentence, ''hon da''. However, numerous constructions seem to be incompatible with the suffixal copula claim.\n\n:(1) Reduplication for emphasis\n::''Hora! Hon, hon!'' 'See, it ''is'' a book!'\n::''Hora! Kirei, kirei!'' 'See, it ''is'' pretty!'\n::''Hora! Furui, furui!'' 'See, it ''is'' old!' (the adjectival inflection -''i'' cannot be left off)\n::''Hora! Iku, iku!'' 'See, it ''does'' go!' (the verbal inflection -''u'' cannot be left off)\n\n:(2) Questions. In Japanese, questions are formed by adding the particle ''ka'' (or in colloquial speech, just by changing the intonation of the sentence).\n::''Hon/kirei ka?'' 'Is it a book? ; Is it pretty?'\n::''Furu-i/Ik-u ka?'' 'Is it old? ; Does it go?' (the inflections cannot be left off)\n\n:(3) Several auxiliary verbs, e.g., ''mitai'', 'looks like it's'\n::''Hon mitai da; Kirei mitai da'' 'It seems to be a book; It seems to be pretty'\n::''Furu-i mitai da; Ik-u mitai da'' 'It seems to be old; It seems to go'\n\nOn the basis of such constructions, Uehara (1998) finds that the copula is indeed an independent word, and that regarding the parameters on which ''i''-adjectives share the syntactic pattern of verbs, the nominal adjectives pattern with pure nouns instead.\n\nSimilarly, [[Eleanor Jorden]] considers this class of words a kind of nominal, not adjective, and refers to them as ''na''-nominals in her textbook ''[[Japanese: The Spoken Language]].''\n\n==Nouns==\n{{see also|Honorific speech in Japanese}}\nJapanese has no [[grammatical gender]], [[grammatical number|number]], or [[article (grammar)|article]]s (though the demonstrative {{lang|ja|\u305d\u306e}}, {{transl|ja|sono}}, \"that, those\", is often translatable as \"the\"). Thus, specialists{{who|date=September 2015}} have agreed that Japanese [[noun]]s are [[inflection|noninflecting]]: {{lang|ja|\u732b}} {{transl|ja|neko}} can be translated as \"cat\", \"cats\", \"a cat\", \"the cat\", \"some cats\" and so forth, depending on context. However, as part of the extensive pair of grammatical systems that Japanese possesses for ''honorification'' (making discourse deferential to the addressee or even to a third party) and politeness, nouns too can be modified. Nouns take politeness prefixes (which have not been regarded as inflections): ''o-'' for native nouns, and ''go-'' for Sino-Japanese nouns. A few examples are given in the following table. In a few cases, there is [[suppletion]], as with the first of the examples given below, 'rice'. (Note that while these prefixes are almost always in ''[[Hiragana]]''&nbsp;\u2014 that is, as {{lang|ja|\u304a}}  {{transl|ja|o-}} or {{lang|ja|\u3054}} {{transl|ja|go}}&nbsp;\u2014 the ''[[kanji]]'' {{lang|ja|\u5fa1}} is used for both ''o'' and ''go'' prefixes in formal writing.)\n\n<div style=\"margin-left: 2em; float: right;\">\n{| class=\"wikitable\" <!-- border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" -->\n|+ Respectful forms of nouns\n! meaning !! plain !! respectful\n|-\n| meal || {{lang|ja|\u98ef}} {{transl|ja|meshi}} || {{lang|ja|\u3054\u98ef}} {{transl|ja|go-han}}\n|-\n| money || {{lang|ja|\u91d1}} {{transl|ja|kane}} || {{lang|ja|\u304a\u91d1}} {{transl|ja|o-kane}}\n|-\n| body || {{lang|ja|\u4f53}} {{transl|ja|karada}} || {{lang|ja|\u304a\u4f53}} {{transl|ja|o-karada}}<br>{{lang|ja|\u5fa1\u8eab}} {{transl|ja|onmi}}\n|-\n| word(s) || {{lang|ja|\u8a00\u8449}} {{transl|ja|kotoba}} || {{lang|ja|\u304a\u8a00\u8449}} {{transl|ja|o-kotoba}}<br>{{lang|ja|\u8a54}} {{transl|ja|mikotonori}}\n|}\n</div>\nLacking number, Japanese does not differentiate between [[count noun|count]] and [[mass noun]]s. (An English speaker learning Japanese would be well advised to treat Japanese nouns as mass nouns.) A small number of nouns have [[collective number|collective]]s formed by [[reduplication]] (possibly accompanied by voicing and related processes ([[rendaku]])); for example: ''hito'' 'person' and ''hitobito'' 'people'. Reduplication is not [[productivity (linguistics)|productive]]. Words in Japanese referring to more than one of something are collectives, not [[plural]]s. ''Hitobito'', for example, means \"a lot of people\" or \"people in general\". It is never used to mean \"two people\". A phrase like ''edo no hitobito'' would be taken to mean \"the people of [[Edo]]\", or \"the population of Edo\", not \"two people from Edo\" or even \"a few people from Edo\". Similarly, ''yamayama'' means \"many mountains\".\n\nA limited number of nouns have collective forms that refer to groups of people. Examples include ''watashi-tachi'', 'we'; ''anata-tachi'', 'you (plural)'; ''bokura'', 'we (less formal, more masculine)'. One uncommon personal noun, ''ware'', 'I', or in some cases, 'you', has a much more common reduplicative collective form ''wareware'' 'we'.\n\nThe suffixes ''-tachi'' (\u9054) and ''-ra'' (\u7b49) are by far the most common collectivizing suffixes. These are, again, not pluralizing suffixes: ''tar\u014d-tachi'' does not mean \"some number of people named Taro\", but instead indicates the group including Taro. Depending on context, ''tar\u014d-tachi'' might be translated into \"Taro and his friends\", \"Taro and his siblings\", \"Taro and his family\", or any other logical grouping that has Taro as the representative. Some words with collectives have become fixed phrases and (commonly) refer to one person. Specifically, ''kodomo'' 'child' and ''tomodachi'' 'friend' can be singular, even though ''-[t]omo'' and ''-[t]achi'' were originally collectivizing in these words; to unambiguously refer to groups of them, an additional collectivizing suffix is added: ''kodomotachi'' 'children' and ''tomodachitachi'' 'friends', though ''tomodachitachi'' is somewhat uncommon. ''Tachi'' is sometimes applied to inanimate objects, ''kuruma'' 'car' and ''kuruma-tachi'', 'cars', for example, but this usage is colloquial and indicates a high level of anthropomorphisation and childlikeness, and is not more generally accepted as standard.\n\n===Grammatical case===\n\n[[Grammatical case]]s in Japanese are marked by [[Japanese particles|particles]] placed after the nouns.<ref name=\"tarou takahashi\">{{cite book|last=Takahashi|first=Tarou|title=A Japanese Grammar|year=2010|publisher=Hitsuji Shobou|location=Japan|isbn=978-4-89476-244-2|page=27|display-authors=etal|language=Japanese|edition=4}}</ref> A distinctive feature of Japanese is the presence of two cases which are roughly equivalent to the nominative case in other languages: one representing the [[Topic and comment|sentence topic]], other representing the subject.

''Kare'' and ''kanojo'' also mean \"boyfriend\" and \"girlfriend\" respectively, and this usage of the words is possibly more common than the use as pronouns.\n\nLike other [[subject (grammar)|subject]]s, Japanese deemphasizes personal ''daimeishi'', which are seldom used. This is partly because Japanese sentences do not always require explicit subjects, and partly because names or titles are often used where pronouns would appear in a translation:\n:\u300c\u6728\u4e0b\u3055\u3093\u306f\u3001\u80cc\u304c\u9ad8\u3044\u3067\u3059\u306d\u3002\u300d\n:''Kinoshita-san wa, se ga takai desu ne.''\n: (addressing Mr. Kinoshita) \"You're pretty tall, aren't you?\"\n:\u300c\u5c02\u52d9\u3001\u660e\u65e5\u798f\u5ca1\u5e02\u897f\u533a\u306e\u5c71\u672c\u5546\u4e8b\u306e\u793e\u9577\u306b\u4f1a\u3063\u3066\u3044\u305f\u3060\u3051\u307e\u3059\u304b\uff1f\u300d\n:''Semmu, asu Fukuoka-shi nishi-ku no Yamamoto-sh\u014dji no shach\u014d ni atte itadakemasu ka?''\n: (addressing the managing director) \"Would it be possible for you to meet the president of Yamamoto Trading Co. in [[Nishi-ku, Fukuoka|West Ward, Fukuoka]] tomorrow?\"\n\nThe possible referents of ''daimeishi'' are sometimes constrained depending on the order of occurrence. The following pair of examples from Bart Mathias<ref>Bart Mathias. [http://groups-beta.google.com/group/sci.lang.japan/msg/fed63fa6c3614895?dmode=source Discussion of pronoun reference constraints] on sci.lang.japan.</ref> illustrates one such constraint.\n:''Honda-kun ni atte, kare no hon o kaeshita'' (\u672c\u7530\u541b\u306b\u4f1a\u3063\u3066\u3001\u5f7c\u306e\u672c\u3092\u8fd4\u3057\u305f\u3002)\n:(I) met Honda and returned his book. (\"His\" here can refer to Honda.)\n:''Kare ni atte, Honda-kun no hon o kaeshita'' (\u5f7c\u306b\u4f1a\u3063\u3066\u3001\u672c\u7530\u541b\u306e\u672c\u3092\u8fd4\u3057\u305f\u3002)\n:(I) met him and returned Honda's book. (Here, \"him\" ''cannot'' refer to Honda.)\n\n===Reflexive pronouns===\nEnglish has a reflexive form of each [[personal pronoun]] (''himself'', ''herself'', ''itself'', ''themselves'', etc.); Japanese, in contrast, has one main reflexive ''daimeishi'', namely ''jibun'' (\u81ea\u5206), which can also mean 'I'. The uses of the reflexive (pro)nouns in the two languages are very different, as demonstrated by the following literal translations (*=impossible, ??=ambiguous):\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin-left: 2em;\"\n! English !! Japanese !! reason\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| History repeats itself.\n| *''Rekishi wa jibun o kurikaesu.''

The use of ''jibun'' in complex sentences follows non-trivial rules.\n\nThere are also equivalents to ''jibun'' such as ''mizukara''. Other uses of the [[reflexive pronoun]] in English are covered by adverbs like ''hitorideni'' which is used in the sense of \"by oneself\". For example,\n:\u6a5f\u68b0\u304c\u3072\u3068\u308a\u3067\u306b\u52d5\u304d\u51fa\u3057\u305f\n:''kikai ga hitorideni ugokidashita''\n:\"The machine started operating by itself.\"\n\nChange in a verb's [[Valency (linguistics)|valency]] is not accomplished by use of reflexive pronouns (in this Japanese is like English but unlike many other European languages). Instead, separate (but usually related) [[intransitive verb]]s and [[transitive verb]]s are used. There is no longer any productive morphology to derive transitive verbs from intransitive ones, or vice versa.{{clarify|date=March 2020}}\n\n===Demonstratives===\n<div style=\"margin-left: 2em; float: right\">\n{| class=\"wikitable\" <!-- cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" border=\"1\" -->\n|+ Demonstratives\n!\n!

The ''ko-'' (proximal) series refers to things closer to the speaker than the hearer, the ''so-'' (medial) series for things closer to the hearer, and the ''a-'' (distal) series for things distant to both the speaker and the hearer. With ''do-'', demonstratives turn into the corresponding interrogative form. Demonstratives can also be used to refer to people, for example\n:\u300c\u3053\u3061\u3089\u306f\u6797\u3055\u3093\u3067\u3059\u3002\u300d\n:''Kochira wa Hayashi-san desu.''\n:\"This is Mr. Hayashi.\"\n\nDemonstratives limit, and therefore precede, nouns; thus \u3053\u306e\u672c  ''kono hon'' for \"this/my book\", and \u305d\u306e\u672c  ''sono hon'' for \"that/your book\".\n\nWhen demonstratives are used to refer to things not visible to the speaker or the hearer, or to (abstract) concepts, they fulfill a related but different [[Anaphora (linguistics)|anaphoric]] role. The anaphoric distals are used for shared information between the speaker and the listener.\n:A\uff1a\u5148\u65e5\u3001\u672d\u5e4c\u306b\u884c\u3063\u3066\u6765\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\n:''A: Senjitsu, Sapporo ni itte kimashita.''\n:A: I visited Sapporo recently.\n:B\uff1a\u3042\u305d\u3053(*\u305d\u3053)\u306f\u3044\u3064\u884c\u3063\u3066\u3082\u3044\u3044\u6240\u3067\u3059\u306d\u3002\n:''B: Asoko (*Soko) wa itsu itte mo ii tokoro desu ne.''\n:B: Yeah, that's a great place to visit whenever you go.\n\n''Soko'' instead of ''asoko'' would imply that B doesn't share this knowledge about Sapporo, which is inconsistent with the meaning of the sentence. The anaphoric medials are used to refer to experience or knowledge that is not shared between the speaker and listener.\n:\u4f50\u85e4\uff1a\u7530\u4e2d\u3068\u3044\u3046\u4eba\u304c\u6628\u65e5\u6b7b\u3093\u3060\u3093\u3060\u3063\u3066\u3002\n:''Sat\u014d : Tanaka to iu hito ga kin\u014d shinda n da tte...

The [[Anatomical terms of location#Proximal and distal|proximal]] demonstratives do not have clear anaphoric uses. They can be used in situations where the distal series sound too disconnected:\n:\u4e00\u4f53\u4f55\u3067\u3059\u304b\u3001\u3053\u308c(*\u3042\u308c)\u306f?\n:''Ittai nan desu ka, kore (*are) wa?''\n:What on earth is this?\n\n==Conjugable words==\n\n===Stem forms===\nPrior to discussing the conjugable words, a brief note about ''stem forms''. Conjugative suffixes and auxiliary verbs are attached to the stem forms of the affixee. In modern Japanese there are the following six stem forms.\n\nNote that this order follows from the ''-a, -i, -u, -e, -o'' endings that these forms have in \u4e94\u6bb5 (5-row) verbs (according to the \u3042\u3001\u3044\u3001\u3046\u3001\u3048\u3001\u304a collation order of Japanese), where terminal and attributive forms are the same for verbs (hence only 5 surface forms), but differ for nominals, notably ''na''-nominals.\n; ''Irrealis form'' (\u672a\u7136\u5f62 ''mizenkei'') ''-a'' (and ''-\u014d''): is used for plain negative (of verbs), causative and passive constructions. The most common use of this form is with the ''-nai'' auxiliary that turns verbs into their negative (predicate) form. (See Verbs below.) The ''-\u014d'' version is used for volitional expression and formed by a euphonic change (\u97f3\u4fbf onbin).\n; ''Continuative form'' (\u9023\u7528\u5f62 ''ren'y\u014dkei'') ''-i'': is used in a linking role (a kind of [[serial verb construction]]). This is the most productive stem form, taking on a variety of endings and auxiliaries, and can even occur independently in a sense similar to the ''-te'' ending. This form is also used to negate adjectives.\n; ''Terminal form'' (\u7d42\u6b62\u5f62 ''sh\u016bshikei'') ''-u'': is used at the ends of clauses in [[predicate (grammar)|predicate]] positions. This form is also variously known as ''plain form'' (\u57fa\u672c\u5f62 ''kihonkei'') or ''[[dictionary form]]'' (\u8f9e\u66f8\u5f62 ''jishokei'') \u2013 it is the form that verbs are listed under in a dictionary.\n; ''[[Attributive verb#Japanese|Attributive form]]'' ({{visible anchor|\u9023\u4f53\u5f62}} ''rentaikei'') ''-u'': is prefixed to nominals and is used to define or classify the noun, similar to a [[relative clause]] in English. In modern Japanese it is practically identical to the terminal form, except that verbs are generally not inflected for politeness; in old Japanese these forms differed. Further, ''na''-nominals behave differently in terminal and attributive positions; see [[#Adjectives|adjectives]], below.\n; ''Hypothetical form'' (\u4eee\u5b9a\u5f62 ''kateikei'') ''-e'': is used for conditional and subjunctive forms, using the ''-ba'' ending.\n; ''Imperative form'' (\u547d\u4ee4\u5f62 ''meireikei'') ''-e'': is used to turn verbs into commands. Adjectives do not have an imperative stem form.\n\nThe application of conjugative suffixes to stem forms follow certain euphonic principles (\u97f3\u4fbf ''onbin''), which are discussed below.\n\n===Verbs===\n{{Main|Japanese verb conjugation}}\n\nVerbs (\u52d5\u8a5e ''d\u014dshi'') in Japanese are rigidly constrained to the ends of clauses in what is known as the ''predicate position''. This means that the verb is always located at the end of a sentence.\n{| cellpadding=\"2px\" style=\"margin-left: 2em;\"\n|-\n| \u732b || \u306f || \u9b5a || \u3092 || \u98df\u3079\u308b\u3002\n|-\n| ''neko'' || ''wa'' || ''sakana'' || ''o'' || ''taberu''\n|-\n| Cats || TOPIC || fish || OBJECT || eat\n|-\n|colspan=\"5\"| Cats eat fish.\n|}\nThe subject and objects of the verb are indicated by means of ''[[Japanese grammar#Particles|particles]]'', and the grammatical functions of the verb&nbsp;\u2014 primarily tense and voice&nbsp;\u2014 are indicated by means of [[Grammatical conjugation|conjugation]]. When the subject and the dissertative topic coincide, the subject is often omitted; if the verb is intransitive, the entire sentence may consist of a single verb. Verbs have two tenses indicated by conjugation, past and nonpast. The semantic difference between present and future is not indicated by means of conjugation. Usually there is no ambiguity as context makes it clear whether the speaker is referring to the present or future. Voice and aspect are also indicated by means of conjugation, and possibly agglutinating auxiliary verbs. For example, the continuative aspect is formed by means of the continuative conjugation known as the ''gerundive'' or ''[[te form of Japanese verb|-te form]]'', and the auxiliary verb ''iru'' \"to be\"; to illustrate, \u898b\u308b  ''miru'' (\"to see\") \u2192 \u898b\u3066\u3044\u308b  ''mite iru'' (\"to be seeing\").\n\nVerbs can be semantically classified based on certain conjugations.\n; Stative verbs: indicate existential properties, such as \"to be\" (\u3044\u308b ''iru''), \"to be able to do\" (\u51fa\u6765\u308b ''dekiru''), \"to need\" (\u8981\u308b ''iru''), etc. These verbs generally do not have a continuative conjugation with ''-iru'' because they are semantically continuative already.\n; Continual verbs: conjugate with the auxiliary ''-iru'' to indicate the progressive aspect. Examples: \"to eat\" (\u98df\u3079\u308b ''taberu''), \"to drink\" (\u98f2\u3080 ''nomu''), \"to think\" (\u8003\u3048\u308b ''kangaeru''). To illustrate the conjugation, \u98df\u3079\u308b  ''taberu'' (\"to eat\") \u2192 \u98df\u3079\u3066\u3044\u308b  ''tabete iru'' (\"to be eating\").\n; Punctual verbs: conjugate with ''-iru'' to indicate a repeated action, or a continuing state after some action. Example: \u77e5\u308b  ''shiru'' (\"to know\") \u2192 \u77e5\u3063\u3066\u3044\u308b  ''shitte iru'' (\"to be knowing\"); \u6253\u3064  ''utsu'' (\"to hit\") \u2192 \u6253\u3063\u3066\u3044\u308b  ''utte iru'' (\"to be hitting (repeatedly)\").\n; Non-volitional verb: indicate uncontrollable action or emotion. These verbs generally have no volitional, imperative or potential conjugation. Examples: \u597d\u3080  ''konomu'', \"to like / to prefer\" (emotive), \u898b\u3048\u308b  ''mieru'', \"to be visible\" (non-emotive).\n; Movement verbs: indicate motion. Examples: \u6b69\u304f  ''aruku'' (\"to walk\"), \u5e30\u308b  ''kaeru'' (\"to return\"). In the continuative form (see below) they take the particle ''ni'' to indicate a purpose.\nThere are other possible classes, and a large amount of overlap between the classes.\n\nLexically, nearly every verb in Japanese is a member of exactly one of the following three regular ''conjugation groups'' (see also [[Japanese consonant and vowel verbs]]).\n; Group 2a (\u4e0a\u4e00\u6bb5 ''kami ichidan'', lit. upper 1-row group): verbs with a stem ending in ''i''. The terminal stem form always rhymes with ''-iru''. Examples: \u898b\u308b  ''miru'' (\"to see\"), \u7740\u308b  ''kiru'' (\"to wear\").\n; Group 2b (\u4e0b\u4e00\u6bb5 ''shimo ichidan'', lit. lower 1-row group): verbs with a stem ending in ''e''. The terminal stem form always rhymes with ''-eru''. Examples: \u98df\u3079\u308b  ''taberu'' (\"to eat\"), \u304f\u308c\u308b  ''kureru'' (\"to give\" (to someone of lower or more intimate status)). (Note that some Group 1 verbs resemble Group 2b verbs, but their stems end in ''r'', not ''e''.)\n; Group 1 (\u4e94\u6bb5 ''godan'', lit. 5-row group): verbs with a stem ending in a consonant. When this is ''r'' and the verb ends in ''-eru'', it is not apparent from the terminal form whether the verb is Group 1 or Group 2b, e.g. \u5e30\u308b  ''kaeru'' (\"to return\"). If the stem ends in ''w'', that sound only appears in before the final ''a'' of the [[irrealis]] form.\n\nThe \"row\" in the above classification means a row in the [[goj\u016bon]] table. \"Upper 1-row\" means the row that is one row above the center row (the u-row) i.e. i-row. \"Lower 1-row\" means the row that is one row below the center row (the u-row) i.e. e-row. \"5-row\" means the conjugation runs through all 5 rows of the [[goj\u016bon]] table. A conjugation is fully described by identifying both the row and the column in the [[goj\u016bon]] table. For example, \u898b\u308b  (''miru'', \"to see\") belongs to \u30de\u884c\u4e0a\u4e00\u6bb5\u6d3b\u7528 (ma-column i-row conjugation), \u98df\u3079\u308b  (''taberu'', \"to eat\") belongs to \u30d0\u884c\u4e0b\u4e00\u6bb5\u6d3b\u7528 (ba-column e-row conjugation), and \u5e30\u308b (''kaeru'', \"to return\") belongs to \u30e9\u884c\u4e94\u6bb5\u6d3b\u7528(ra-column 5-row conjugation).\n\nOne should avoid confusing verbs in \u30e9\u884c\u4e94\u6bb5\u6d3b\u7528 (ra-column 5-row conjugation) with verbs in \u4e0a\u4e00\u6bb5\u6d3b\u7528 (i-row conjugation) or \u4e0b\u4e00\u6bb5\u6d3b\u7528 (e-row conjugation). For example, \u5207\u308b  (''kiru'', \"to cut\") belongs to \u30e9\u884c\u4e94\u6bb5\u6d3b\u7528 (ra-column 5-row conjugation), whereas its homophone \u7740\u308b  (''kiru'', \"to wear\") belongs to \u30ab\u884c\u4e0a\u4e00\u6bb5\u6d3b\u7528 (ka-column i-row conjugation). Likewise, \u7df4\u308b  (''neru'', \"to knead\") belongs to \u30e9\u884c\u4e94\u6bb5\u6d3b\u7528 (ra-column 5-row conjugation), whereas its homophone \u5bdd\u308b  (''neru'', \"to sleep\") belongs to \u30ca\u884c\u4e0b\u4e00\u6bb5\u6d3b\u7528 (na-column e-row conjugation).\n\nHistorical note: classical Japanese had upper and lower 1- and 2-row groups and a 4-row group (\u4e0a\uff0f\u4e0b\u4e00\u6bb5 ''kami/shimo ichidan'', \u4e0a\uff0f\u4e0b\u4e8c\u6bb5 ''kami/shimo nidan'', and \u56db\u6bb5 ''yodan'', the ''nidan'' verbs becoming most of today's ''ichidan'' verbs (there were only a handful of ''kami ichidan'' verbs and only one single ''shimo ichidan'' verb in classical Japanese), and the ''yodan'' group, due to the writing reform in 1946 to write Japanese as it is pronounced, naturally became the modern ''godan'' verbs. Since verbs have migrated across groups in the history of the language, conjugation of classical verbs is not predictable from a knowledge of modern Japanese alone.\n\nOf the irregular classes, there are two:\n; ''sa''-group: which has only one member, \u3059\u308b  (''suru'', \"to do\"). In Japanese grammars these words are classified as \u30b5\u5909  ''sa-hen'', an abbreviation of \u30b5\u884c\u5909\u683c\u6d3b\u7528  ''sa-gy\u014d henkaku katsuy\u014d'', sa-row irregular conjugation).\n; ''ka''-group: which also has one member, \u6765\u308b  (''kuru'', \"to come\"). The Japanese name for this class is \u30ab\u884c\u5909\u683c\u6d3b\u7528  ''ka-gy\u014d henkaku katsuy\u014d'' or simply \u30ab\u5909  ''ka-hen''.\nClassical Japanese had two further irregular classes, the ''na''-group, which contained \u6b7b\u306c  (''shinu'', \"to die\") and \u5f80\u306c  (''inu'', \"to go\", \"to die\"), the ''ra''-group, which included such verbs as \u3042\u308a  ''ari'', the equivalent of modern ''aru'', as well as quite a number of extremely irregular verbs that cannot be classified.\n\nThe following table illustrates the stem forms of the above conjugation groups, with the root indicated with dots. For example, to find the hypothetical form of the group 1 verb \u66f8\u304f  ''kaku'', look in the second row to find its root, ''kak'', then in the hypothetical row to get the ending ''-e'', giving the stem form ''kake''. When there are multiple possibilities, they are listed in the order of increasing rarity.\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"| group/<br />example\n!colspan=\"2\"| 1\n! 2a\n! 2b\n!rowspan=\"2\"| ''sa''\n!rowspan=\"2\"| ''ka''\n|-\n! \u4f7f\u30fb  ''tsuka(w).''\n! \u66f8\u30fb  ''kak.''\n! \u898b\u30fb  ''mi.''\n! \u98df\u3079\u30fb  ''tabe.''\n|-\n!

In modern Japanese the -''o'' form is used only for the volitional mood and the -''a'' form is used in all other cases; see also the conjugation table below.\n# The unexpected ending is due to the verb's root being ''tsukaw-'' but [w] only being pronounced before [a] in modern Japanese.\n\nThe above are only the stem forms of the verbs; to these one must add various verb endings in order to get the fully conjugated verb.

Japanese adjectives do not have comparative or superlative inflections; comparatives and superlatives have to be marked periphrastically using adverbs like ''motto'' 'more' and ''ichiban'' 'most'.\n\nEvery adjective in Japanese can be used in an [[Adjective#Attributive|attributive position]]. Nearly every Japanese adjective can be used in a [[Adjective#Predicative|predicative position]]; this differs from English where there are many common adjectives such as \"major\", as in \"a major question\", that cannot be used in the predicate position (that is, *\"The question is major\" is not grammatical English). There are a few Japanese adjectives that cannot predicate, known as \u9023\u4f53\u8a5e (''rentaishi,'' attributives), which are derived from other word classes; examples include \u5927\u304d\u306a  ''\u014dkina'' \"big\", \u5c0f\u3055\u306a  ''chiisana'' \"small\", and \u304a\u304b\u3057\u306a ''okashina'' \"strange\" which are all stylistic ''na''-type variants of normal ''i''-type adjectives.\n\nAll ''i''-adjectives except for \u3044\u3044  (''ii'', good) have regular conjugations, and ''ii'' is irregular only in the fact that it is a changed form of the regular adjective \u826f\u3044  ''yoi'' permissible in the terminal and attributive forms.

However, it was only in 1946 that the Japanese ministry of education modified existing [[kana]] usage to conform to the standard dialect (\u5171\u901a\u8a9e ''ky\u014dts\u016bgo''). All earlier texts used the archaic orthography, now referred to as [[historical kana usage]]. The adjoining table is a nearly exhaustive list of these spelling changes.\n\nNote that palatalized morae {{nihongo||\u3086\u3001\u3088|yu, yo}} combine with the initial consonant, if present, yielding a palatalized syllable. The most basic example of this is modern {{Nihongo||\u4eca\u65e5\u3001\u304d\u3087\u3046|ky\u014d|today}}, which historically developed as {{Nihongo||\u3051\u3075|kefu}} \u2192 {{Nihongo||\u304d\u3087\u3046|ky\u014d}}, via the {{Nihongo||\u3048\u3075|efu}} \u2192 {{Nihongo||\u3088\u3046|y\u014d}} rule.\n\nA few sound changes are not reflected in the spelling. Firstly, ''ou'' merged with ''oo,'' both being pronounced as a long ''\u014d.'' Secondly, the particles \u306f and \u3092 are still written using historical kana usage, though these are pronounced as ''wa'' and ''o,'' rather than ''ha'' and ''wo,'' with the rare exception of \u301c\u3093\u3092, which is pronounced as ''-n wo,'' as in {{Nihongo||\u5343\u5186\u3092\u3044\u305f\u3060\u304d\u307e\u3059|sen'en wo itadakimasu|I humbly receive one thousand yen}}.\n\nAmong Japanese speakers, it is not generally understood that the historical ''kana'' spellings were, at one point, reflective of pronunciation. For example, the modern ''on'yomi'' reading {{Nihongo||\u3088\u3046|y\u014d}} for {{Nihongo|leaf|\u8449|y\u014d}} arose from historical {{Nihongo||\u3048\u3075|efu}}. The latter was pronounced something like {{IPA|[\u02b2epu]}} by the Japanese at the time it was borrowed (compare [[Middle Chinese]] {{IPA|[ji\u025bp\u031a]}}). However, a modern reader of a classical text would still read this as {{IPAc-ja|y\u014d}}, the modern pronunciation.\n\n====Verb conjugations====\n:{{Main|Japanese verb conjugation}}\n\nAs mentioned above, conjugations of some verbs and adjectives differ from the prescribed formation rules because of euphonic changes. Nearly all of these euphonic changes are themselves regular. For verbs the exceptions are all in the ending of the continuative form of group when the following auxiliary starts with a ''t''-sound, ''i.e.'', \u305f  ''ta'', \u3066  ''te'', \u305f\u308a  ''tari'', etc.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" <!-- cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" border=\"1\" -->\n! continuative ending !! changes to !! example\n|-\n| \u3044 ''i'', \u3061 ''chi'' or \u308a ''ri''\n| \u3063 (double consonant)\n| *\u8cb7\u3044\u3066 ''*kaite'' \u2192 \u8cb7\u3063\u3066 ''katte''<br>*\u6253\u3061\u3066 ''*uchite'' \u2192 \u6253\u3063\u3066 ''utte''<br>*\u77e5\u308a\u3066 ''*shirite'' \u2192 \u77e5\u3063\u3066 ''shitte''\n|-\n| \u3073 ''bi'', \u307f''mi'' or \u306b ''ni''\n| \u3093 (syllabic ''n''), with the following \u30bf ''t'' sound voiced\n| *\u904a\u3073\u3066 ''*asobite'' \u2192 \u904a\u3093\u3067 ''asonde''<br>*\u4f4f\u307f\u3066 ''*sumite'' \u2192 \u4f4f\u3093\u3067 ''sunde''<br>*\u6b7b\u306b\u3066 ''*shinite'' \u2192 \u6b7b\u3093\u3067 ''shinde''\n|-\n| \u304d ''ki''\n| \u3044 ''i''\n| *\u66f8\u304d\u3066 ''*kakite'' \u2192 \u66f8\u3044\u3066 ''kaite''\n|-\n| \u304e ''gi''\n| \u3044 ''i'', with the following \u30bf ''t'' sound voiced\n| *\u6cf3\u304e\u3066 ''*oyogite'' \u2192 \u6cf3\u3044\u3067 ''oyoide''\n|}\n\n:<nowiki>*</nowiki> denotes impossible/ungrammatical form.\n\nThere is one other irregular change: \u884c\u304f ''iku'' (to go), for which there is an exceptional continuative form: \u884c\u304d ''iki'' + \u3066 ''te'' \u2192 \u884c\u3063\u3066 ''itte'', \u884c\u304d ''iki'' + \u305f ''ta'' \u2192 \u884c\u3063\u305f ''itta'', etc.\n\nThere are dialectical differences, which are also regular and generally occur in similar situations. For example, in [[Kansai dialect]] the ''-i'' + ''t-'' conjugations are instead changed to ''-ut-,'' as in {{Nihongo||\u601d\u3046\u305f|om\u014dta}} instead of {{Nihongo||\u601d\u3063\u305f|omotta}}, as perfective of {{Nihongo||\u601d\u3046|omou|think}}. In this example, this can combine with the preceding vowel via historical sound changes, as in {{Nihongo||\u3057\u3082\u3046\u305f|shim\u014dta}} (''au'' \u2192 ''\u014d'') instead of standard {{Nihongo||\u3057\u307e\u3063\u305f|shimatta}}.\n\n====Polite forms of adjectives====\nThe continuative form of proper adjectives, when followed by polite forms such as {{Nihongo||\u5fa1\u5ea7\u308b|\u3054\u3056\u308b|gozaru|be}} or {{Nihongo||\u5b58\u3058\u308b|zonjiru|know, think}}, undergoes a transformation; this may be followed by historical sound changes, yielding a one-step or two-step sound change. Note that these verbs are almost invariably conjugated to polite {{Nihongo||\u301c\u307e\u3059|-masu}} form, as {{Nihongo||\u3054\u3056\u3044\u307e\u3059|gozaimasu}} and {{Nihongo||\u5b58\u3058\u307e\u3059|zonjimasu}} (note the irregular conjugation of ''gozaru,'' discussed below), and that these verbs are preceded by the ''continuative'' form \u2013 {{Nihongo||\u301c\u304f|-ku}} \u2013 of adjectives, rather than the terminal form \u2013 {{Nihongo||\u301c\u3044|-i}} \u2013 which is used before the more everyday {{Nihongo||\u3067\u3059|desu|be}}.\n\nThe rule is {{Nihongo||\u301c\u304f|-ku}} \u2192 {{Nihongo||\u301c\u3046|-u}} (dropping the ''-k-''), possibly also combining with the previous syllable according to the spelling reform chart, which may also undergo palatalization in the case of {{Nihongo||\u3086\u3001\u3088|yu, yo}}.\n\nHistorically there were two classes of proper [[Old Japanese#Adjectives|Old Japanese adjectives]], {{Nihongo||\u301c\u304f|-ku}} and {{Nihongo||\u301c\u3057\u304f|-shiku}} (\"''-ku'' adjective\" means \"not preceded by ''shi''\"). This distinction collapsed during the evolution of [[Late Middle Japanese#Adjectives|Late Middle Japanese adjectives]], and both are now considered {{Nihongo||\u301c\u3044|-i}} adjectives. The sound change for ''-shii'' adjectives follows the same rule as for other ''-ii'' adjectives, notably that the preceding vowel also changes and the preceding mora undergoes palatalization, yielding {{Nihongo||\u301c\u3057\u304f|-shiku}} \u2192 {{Nihongo||\u301c\u3057\u3085\u3046|-sh\u016b}}, though historically this was considered a separate but parallel rule.\n\n{| class=wikitable <!-- cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5 border=1 -->\n!

For example, in [[Kansai dialect]] {{Nihongo||\u301c\u3066\u3057\u307e\u3046|-te shimau}} \u2192 {{Nihongo||\u301c\u3066\u307e\u3046|-temau}}.\n\n==Other independent words==\n\n===Adverbs===\nAdverbs in Japanese are not as tightly integrated into the morphology as in many other languages. Indeed, adverbs are not an independent class of words, but rather a role played by other words. For example, every adjective in the continuative form can be used as an adverb; thus, \u5f31\u3044  ''yowai'' 'weak' (adj) \u2192 \u5f31\u304f  ''yowaku'' 'weakly' (adv). The primary distinguishing characteristic of adverbs is that they cannot occur in a predicate position, just as it is in English. The following classification of adverbs is not intended to be authoritative or exhaustive.\n; Verbal adverbs: are verbs in the continuative form with the particle ''ni''. E.g. \u898b\u308b  ''miru'' 'to see' \u2192 \u898b\u306b  ''mi ni'' 'for the purpose of seeing', used for instance as: \u898b\u306b\u884c\u304f ''mi ni iku'', ''go to see (something)''.\n; Adjectival adverbs: are adjectives in the continuative form, as mentioned above. Example:  \u5f31\u3044  ''yowai'' 'weak' (adj) \u2192 \u5f31\u304f  ''yowaku'' 'weakly' (adv)\n; Nominal adverbs: are grammatical nouns that function as adverbs. Example: \u4e00\u756a  ''ichiban'' 'most highly'.\n; Sound symbolism: are words that mimic sounds or concepts. Examples: \u304d\u3089\u304d\u3089  ''kirakira'' 'sparklingly', \u307d\u3063\u304f\u308a  ''pokkuri'' 'suddenly', \u3059\u308b\u3059\u308b ''surusuru'' 'smoothly (sliding)', etc.\n\nOften, especially for sound symbolism, the particle ''to'' \"as if\" is used. See the article on [[Japanese sound symbolism]].\n\n===Conjunctions and interjections===\n\nExamples of conjunctions: \u305d\u3057\u3066  ''soshite'' 'and then', \u307e\u305f  ''mata'' 'and then/again', etc.\nAlthough called \"conjunctions\", these words are, as English translations show, actually a kind of adverb.\n\nExamples of interjections: \u306f\u3044 (''hai'', yes/OK/uh), \u3078\u3048 (''hee'', wow!), \u3044\u3044\u3048 (''iie'', no/no way), \u304a\u3044 (''oi'', hey!), etc.\nThis part of speech is not very different from that of English.\n\n==Ancillary words==\n\n===Particles===\n:{{Main|Japanese particles}}\n\nParticles in Japanese are postpositional, as they immediately follow the modified component. A full listing of particles is beyond the scope of this article, so only a few prominent particles are listed here. Keep in mind that the pronunciation and spelling differ for the particles ''wa'' (\u306f), ''e''  (\u3078) and ''o'' (\u3092): This article follows the [[Hepburn romanization|Hepburn-style]] of romanizing them according to the ''pronunciation'' rather than spelling.\n\n====Topic, theme, and subject: \u306f ''wa'' and \u304c ''ga''====\nThe complex distinction between the so-called topic (\u306f ''wa'') and subject (\u304c ''ga'') particles has been the theme of many doctoral dissertations and scholarly disputes. The clause \u8c61\u306f\u9f3b\u304c\u9577\u3044 ''z\u014d-wa hana-ga nagai'' is well known for appearing to contain two subjects. It does not simply mean \"the elephant's nose is long\", as that can be translated as \u8c61\u306e\u9f3b\u306f\u9577\u3044 ''z\u014d-no hana-wa nagai''. Rather, a more literal translation would be \"(speaking of) the elephant, its nose is long\".\n\nTwo major scholarly surveys of Japanese linguistics in English, (Shibatani 1990) and (Kuno 1973), clarify the distinction. To simplify matters, the referents of ''wa'' and ''ga'' in this section are called the ''topic'' and ''subject'' respectively, with the understanding that if either is absent, the grammatical topic and subject may coincide.\n\nAs an abstract and rough approximation, the difference between ''wa'' and ''ga'' is a matter of focus: ''wa'' gives focus to the ''action'' of the sentence, i.e., to the verb or adjective, whereas ''ga'' gives focus to the ''subject'' of the action. However, a more useful description must proceed by enumerating uses of these particles.\n\nHowever, when first being introduced to the topic and subject markers ''wa'' and ''ga'' most are told that the difference between the two is simpler. The topic marker, ''wa'', is used to declare or to make a statement. The subject marker, ''ga'', is used for new information, or asking for new information.\n\n''See [[Topic marker#Japanese: \u306f|Topic marker: Japanese: \u306f]].\n\n=====Thematic ''wa''=====\nThe use of ''wa'' to introduce a new theme of discourse is directly linked to the notion of grammatical theme. Opinions differ on the structure of discourse theme, though it seems fairly uncontroversial to imagine a first-in-first-out hierarchy of themes that is threaded through the discourse. Of course, human limitations restrict the scope and depth of themes, and later themes may cause earlier themes to expire. In these sorts of sentences, the steadfast translation into English uses constructs like \"''speaking of X''\" or \"''on the topic of X''\", though such translations tend to be bulky as they fail to use the thematic mechanisms of English. For lack of a comprehensive strategy, many teachers of Japanese emphasize the \"''speaking of X''\" pattern without sufficient warning.\n:\u30b8\u30e7\u30f3\u306f\u5b66\u751f\u3067\u3059\u3002\n:''JON wa gakusei desu''\n: (On the topic of) John, (he) is a student.\n\nA common linguistic joke shows the insufficiency of rote translation with the sentence \u50d5\u306f\u30a6\u30ca\u30ae\u3060 ''boku wa unagi da'', which per the pattern would translate as \"''I am an eel.''\" (or \"(As of) me is eel\"). Yet, in a restaurant this sentence can reasonably be used to say \"My order is eel\" (or \"I would like to order an eel\"), with no intended humour. This is because the sentence should be literally read, \"As for me, it is an eel,\" with \"it\" referring to the speaker's order. The topic of the sentence is clearly not its subject.\n\n=====Contrastive ''wa''=====\nRelated to the role of ''wa'' in introducing themes is its use in contrasting the current topic and its aspects from other possible topics and their aspects. The suggestive pattern is \"''X, but...''\" or \"''as for X, ...''\".\n:{{lang|ja|\u96e8\u306f\u964d\u3063\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u304c...}}\n:''ame wa futte imasu ga...''\n:The rain is falling, but...\n\nBecause of its contrastive nature, the topic cannot be undefined.\n: *\u8ab0\u304b\u306f\u672c\u3092\u8aad\u3093\u3067\u3044\u308b\u3002\n: *''dareka wa hon o yonde iru''\n: *Someone is reading the book.\n\nIn this use, ''ga'' is required.\n\nIn practice, the distinction between thematic and contrastive ''wa'' is not that useful. Suffice it to say that there can be at most one thematic ''wa'' in a sentence, and it has to be the first ''wa'' if one exists, and the remaining ''wa''s are contrastive. For completeness, the following sentence (due to Kuno) illustrates the difference.\n:\u50d5\u304c\u77e5\u3063\u3066\u3044\u308b\u4eba\u306f\u8ab0\u3082\u6765\u306a\u304b\u3063\u305f\u3002\n:''boku ga shitte iru hito wa daremo konakatta''\n:(1) Of all the people I know, none came.\n:(2) (People came but), there weren't any of the people I know.\n\nThe first interpretation is the thematic ''wa'', treating \"the people I know\" (''boku ga shitte iru hito'') as the theme of the predicate \"none came\" (''dare mo konakatta''). That is, if I know A, B, ..., Z, then none of the people who came were A, B, ..., Z. The second interpretation is the contrastive ''wa''. If the likely attendees were A, B, ..., Z, and of them I know P, Q and R, then the sentence says that P, Q and R did not come. The sentence says ''nothing'' about A', B', ..., Z', all of whom I know, but none of whom were likely to come. (In practice the first interpretation is the likely one.)\n\n=====Exhaustive ''ga''=====\nUnlike ''wa'', the subject particle ''ga'' nominates its referent as the sole satisfier of the predicate. This distinction is famously illustrated by the following pair of sentences.\n:\u30b8\u30e7\u30f3\u3055\u3093\u306f\u5b66\u751f\u3067\u3059\u3002\n:''Jon-san wa gakusei desu''\n:John is a student. (There may be other students among the people we're talking about.)\n:(\u3053\u306e\u30b0\u30eb\u30fc\u30d7\u306e\u4e2d\u3067)\u30b8\u30e7\u30f3\u304c\u5b66\u751f\u3067\u3059\u3002\n:''(Kono gur\u016bpu no naka de) Jon ga gakusei desu''\n:(Of all the people we are talking about) it is John who is the student.\n\nIt may be useful to think of the distinction in terms of the question each statement could answer, e.g.:\n:\u30b8\u30e7\u30f3\u3055\u3093\u306e\u4ed5\u4e8b\u306f\u4f55\u3067\u3059\u304b\u3002\n:''Jon-san no shigoto wa nan desu ka''\n:What is John's occupation?\nfor the first statement, versus\n:\u3069\u3061\u3089\u306e\u65b9\u304c\u5b66\u751f\u3067\u3059\u304b\u3002\n:''Dochira no kata ga gakusei desu ka''\n:Which one (of them) is the student?\nfor the second.\n\nSimilarly, in a restaurant, if the waitress asks who has ordered the eels, the customer who ordered it can say{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}\n:\u50d5\u304c\u30a6\u30ca\u30ae\u3060\u3002\n:''Boku ga unagi da''\n:The eels are for me (not these other people).\n\n=====Objective ''ga''=====\nFor certain verbs, typically ''ga'' instead of ''o'' is used to mark what would be the direct object in English: \n:\u30b8\u30e7\u30f3\u3055\u3093\u306f\u30d5\u30e9\u30f3\u30b9\u8a9e\u304c\u51fa\u6765\u308b\u3002\n:''Jon-san wa furansu-go ga dekiru''\n:John knows French.\n\nThese notions that would be thought of as actions, or \"verbs\" in English, e.g. \u51fa\u6765\u308b (to be able to), \u307b\u3057\u3044 (is/are desirable), \u597d\u304d\u3060 (is/are liked), \u5acc\u3044\u3060 (is/are disliked), etc., are in fact simply adjectives and intransitive verbs whose subject is what would be a direct object in the English translation. The equivalent of the English subject is instead the [[Topic\u2013comment|topic]] in Japanese and thus marked by ''wa'', reflecting the [[Topic-prominent language|topic-prominent]] nature of Japanese grammar.\n\n====Objects, locatives, instrumentals: \u3092 ''o'', \u3067 ''de'', \u306b ''ni'', \u3078 ''e''====\nThe direct object of transitive verbs is indicated by the object particle \u3092 ''o''.\n:\u30b8\u30e7\u30f3\u3055\u3093\u306f\u9752\u3044\u30bb\u30fc\u30bf\u30fc\u3092\u7740\u3066\u3044\u308b\u3002\n:''Jon-san wa aoi s\u0113t\u0101 o kite iru''\n:John is wearing a blue sweater.\n\nThis particle can also mean \"through\" or \"along\" or \"out of\" when used with motion verbs.\n:\u30e1\u30a2\u30ea\u304c\u7d30\u3044\u9053\u3092\u6b69\u3044\u3066\u3044\u305f\u3002\n:''MEARI ga hosoi michi o aruite ita''\n:Mary was walking along a narrow road.\n:\u56fd\u5883\u306e\u9577\u3044\u30c8\u30f3\u30cd\u30eb\u3092\u629c\u3051\u308b\u3068\u96ea\u56fd\u3067\u3042\u3063\u305f\u3002\n:''kokky\u014d no nagai TONNERU o nukeru to yukiguni de atta''\n:The train came out of the long tunnel into the snow country.\n\nThe general instrumental particle is \u3067 ''de'', which can be translated as \"using\" or \"by\":\n:\u8089\u306f\u30ca\u30a4\u30d5\u3067\u5207\u308b\u3053\u3068\u3002\n:''niku wa NAIFU de kiru koto''\n:Meat must be cut with a knife.\n:\u96fb\u8eca\u3067\u884c\u304d\u307e\u3057\u3087\u3046\u3002\n:''densha de ikimash\u014d''\n:Let's go by train.\n\nThis particle also has other uses: \"at\" (temporary location):\n:\u753a\u89d2\u3067\u5148\u751f\u306b\u4f1a\u3063\u305f\u3002\n:''machikado de sensei ni atta''\n:(I) met my teacher at the street corner.\n\n\"In\":\n:\u6d77\u3067\u6cf3\u3050\u306e\u306f\u96e3\u3057\u3044\u3002\n:''umi de oyogu no wa muzukashii''\n:Swimming in the sea is hard.\n\n\"With\" or \"in (the span of)\":\n:\u5287\u306f\u4e3b\u4eba\u516c\u306e\u6b7b\u3067\u7d42\u308b\u3002\n:''geki wa shujink\u014d no shi de owaru''\n:The play ends with the protagonist's death.\n:\u4ffa\u306f\u4e8c\u79d2\u3067\u52dd\u3064\u3002\n:''ore wa niby\u014d de katsu''\n:I'll win in two seconds.\n\nThe general locative particle is \u306b ''ni''.\n:\u6771\u4eac\u306b\u884c\u304d\u307e\u3057\u3087\u3046\u3002\n:''T\u014dky\u014d ni ikimash\u014d''\n:Let's go to [[Tokyo]]\n\nIn this function it is interchangeable with \u3078 ''e''.

(particle + noun + particle)\n\n===Auxiliary verbs===\nAll auxiliary verbs attach to a verbal or adjectival [[#Stem forms|stem form]] and conjugate as verbs. In modern Japanese there are two distinct classes of auxiliary verbs:\n; Pure auxiliaries (\u52a9\u52d5\u8a5e ''jod\u014dshi'') : are usually just called ''verb endings'' or ''conjugated forms''. These auxiliaries do not function as independent verbs.\n; Helper auxiliaries (\u88dc\u52a9\u52d5\u8a5e ''hojod\u014dshi'') : are normal verbs that lose their independent meaning when used as auxiliaries.\n\nIn classical Japanese, which was more heavily agglutinating than modern Japanese, the category of ''auxiliary verb'' included every verbal ending after the stem form, and most of these endings were themselves inflected. In modern Japanese, however, some of them have stopped being productive. The prime example is the classical auxiliary \u305f\u308a ''-tari'', whose modern forms \u305f ''-ta'' and \u3066 ''-te'' are no longer viewed as inflections of the same suffix, and can take no further affixes.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|+ '''Some pure auxiliary verbs'''\n! auxiliary !! group !! attaches to !! meaning modification !! example\n|-\n| \u307e\u3059  ''masu'' || irregular<sup>1</sup> || continuative || makes the sentence polite\n| \u66f8\u304f  ''kaku'' 'to write' \u2192 \u66f8\u304d\u307e\u3059  ''kakimasu''\n|-\n| \u3089\u308c\u308b  ''rareru''<sup>2</sup>\n|rowspan=\"3\"| 2b\n| irrealis of grp.&nbsp;2\n| makes V passive/honorific/potential\n| \u898b\u308b  ''miru'' 'to see' \u2192 \u898b\u3089\u308c\u308b  ''mirareru'' 'to be able to see'<br />\u98df\u3079\u308b ''taberu'' 'to eat' \u2192 \u98df\u3079\u3089\u308c\u308b  ''taberareru'' 'to be able to eat'\n|-\n| \u308c\u308b  ''reru'' || irrealis of grp.&nbsp;1\n| makes V passive/honorific\n| \u98f2\u3080  ''nomu'' 'to drink/swallow' \u2192 \u98f2\u307e\u308c\u308b  ''nomareru'' 'to be drunk' (Passive form of ''drink'', not a synonym for ''intoxicated''.)\n|-\n| \u308b  ''ru''<sup>3</sup> || hyp. of grp.&nbsp;1\n| makes V potential\n| \u98f2\u3080  ''nomu'' 'to drink/swallow' \u2192 \u98f2\u3081\u308b  ''nomeru'' 'to be able to drink'\n|-\n| \u3055\u305b\u308b  ''saseru''<sup>4</sup>\n|rowspan=\"2\"| 2b\n| irrealis of grp.&nbsp;2\n|rowspan=\"2\"| makes V causative\n| \u8003\u3048\u308b  ''kangaeru'' 'to think' \u2192 \u8003\u3048\u3055\u305b\u308b  ''kangaesaseru'' 'to cause to think'\n|-\n| \u305b\u308b  ''seru'' || irrealis of grp.&nbsp;1\n| \u601d\u3044\u77e5\u308b  ''omoishiru'' 'to realize' \u2192 \u601d\u3044\u77e5\u3089\u305b\u308b  ''omoishiraseru'' 'to cause to realize/to teach a lesson'\n|}\n:<sup>1</sup> \u307e\u3059  ''masu'' has stem forms: irrealis \u307e\u305b and \u307e\u3057\u3087, continuative \u307e\u3057, terminal \u307e\u3059, attributive \u307e\u3059, hypothetical \u307e\u3059\u308c, imperative \u307e\u305b.\n:<sup>2</sup> \u3089\u308c\u308b  ''rareru'' in potential usage is sometimes shortened to \u308c\u308b  ''reru'' (grp.&nbsp;2); thus \u98df\u3079\u308c\u308b  ''tabereru'' 'to be able to eat' instead of \u98df\u3079\u3089\u308c\u308b  ''taberareru''. But it is considered non-standard.\n:<sup>3</sup> Technically, such an auxiliary verb \u308b, ''ru'', denoting the potential form, does not exist, as for example \u98f2\u3081\u308b  ''nomeru'' is thought to actually come from the contraction of \u98f2\u307f\u5f97\u308b, ''nomieru'' (see below). However, textbooks tend to teach it this way. (\u98f2\u3081\u308b in old texts would have been the attributive past tense form of \u98f2\u3080 instead of the potential meaning.)\n:<sup>4</sup> \u3055\u305b\u308b  ''saseru'' is sometimes shortened to \u3055\u3059  ''sasu'' (grp.&nbsp;1), but this usage is somewhat literary.\n\nMuch of the agglutinative flavour of Japanese stems from helper auxiliaries, however.

In language typology, it has many features divergent from most European languages. Its phrases are exclusively [[head-final]] and compound sentences are exclusively left-[[branching (linguistics)|branching]].<ref>In contrast, [[Romance languages]] such as [[Spanish language|Spanish]] are strongly right-branching, and [[Germanic languages]] such as [[English language|English]] are weakly right-branching</ref> There are many [[subject\u2013object\u2013verb|such languages]], but few among [[European languages]]. It is a [[topic-prominent language]].\n\n==Some distinctive aspects of modern Japanese sentence structure==\n\n===Word order: head final and left branching===\nThe modern theory of constituent order (\"word order\"), usually attributed to [[Joseph Greenberg]], identifies several kinds of phrases. Each one has a '''head''' and possibly a modifier. The head of a phrase either precedes its modifier (head initial) or follows it (head final). Some of these phrase types, with the head marked in boldface, are:\n*genitive phrase, i.e., noun modified by another noun (\"the '''cover''' of the book\", \"the book's '''cover'''\");\n*noun governed by an [[Preposition and postposition|adposition]] (\"'''on''' the table\", \"'''underneath''' the table\");\n*comparison (\"[X is] '''bigger''' than Y\", i.e., \"compared to Y, X is '''big'''\").\n*noun modified by an adjective (\"black '''cat'''\").\n\nSome languages are inconsistent in constituent order, having a mixture of head initial phrase types and head final phrase types. Looking at the preceding list, English for example is mostly head initial, but nouns ''follow'' the adjectives which modify them. Moreover, genitive phrases can be either head initial or head final in English. Japanese, by contrast, is the epitome of a head final language:\n*genitive phrase: \"{{lang|ja|\u732b\u306e'''\u8272'''}}\" ({{transl|ja|neko no '''iro'''}}), cat GEN color = \"the cat's ({{transl|ja|neko no}}) '''color''' ({{transl|ja|iro}})\";\n*noun governed by an ''adposition'':{{lang|ja|\u65e5\u672c'''\u306b'''}} ({{transl|ja|nihon '''ni'''}}), Japan in = \"'''in''' Japan\";\n*comparison: \"{{lang|ja|Y\u3088\u308a'''\u5927\u304d\u3044'''}}\" (Y {{transl|ja|yori '''ookii'''}}), Y than big = \"'''big'''ger than Y\";\n*noun modified by an adjective: \"{{lang|ja|\u9ed2\u3044'''\u732b'''}}\" ({{transl|ja|kuroi '''neko'''}}) = \"black '''cat'''\".\n\nHead finality in Japanese sentence structure carries over to the building of sentences using other sentences. In sentences that have other sentences as constituents, the subordinated sentences (relative clauses, for example), always ''precede'' what they refer to, since they are modifiers and what they modify has the syntactic status of phrasal head.  Translating the phrase ''the man who was walking down the street'' into Japanese word order would be ''street down walking was man''. (Note that Japanese has no articles, and the different word order obviates any need for the relative pronoun ''who''.)\n\nHead finality prevails also when sentences are coordinated instead of subordinated. In the world's languages, it is common to avoid repetition between coordinated clauses by optionally deleting a constituent common to the two parts, as in ''Bob bought his mother some flowers and his father a tie'', where the second ''bought'' is omitted. In Japanese, such \"gapping\" must precede in the reverse order: ''Bob mother for some flowers and father for tie bought''. The reason for this is that in Japanese, sentences (other than occasional inverted sentences or sentences containing afterthoughts) always end in a verb (or other predicative words like adjectival verbs, adjectival nouns, auxiliary verbs)\u2014the only exceptions being a few sentence-ending particles such as ''ka'', ''ne'', and ''yo''. The particle ''ka'' turns a statement into a question, while the others express the speaker's attitude towards the statement.\n\n===Word class system===\nJapanese has five major '''lexical''' [[word class]]es:\n*nouns\n*verbal nouns (correspond to English gerunds like 'studying', 'jumping', which denote activities)\n*nominal adjectives (names vary, also called ''na''-adjectives or \"adjectival nouns\")\n*verbs\n*adjectives (so-called ''i''-adjectives)\nMore broadly, there are two classes: uninflectable (nouns, including verbal nouns and adjectival nouns) and inflectable (verbs, with adjectives as [[defective verb]]s). To be precise, a verbal noun is simply a noun to which {{Nihongo||\u3059\u308b|suru|\"do\"}} can be appended, while an adjectival noun is like a noun but uses {{Nihongo||\u301c\u306a|-na}} instead of {{Nihongo||\u301c\u306e|-no}} when acting attributively. Adjectives (''i''-adjectives) inflect identically to the negative form of verbs, which end in {{Nihongo||\u306a\u3044|na-i}}. Compare {{Nihongo||\u98df\u3079\u306a\u3044|tabe-na-i|don't eat}} \u2192 {{Nihongo||\u98df\u3079\u306a\u304b\u3063\u305f|tabe-na-katta|didn't eat}} and {{Nihongo||\u71b1\u3044|atsu-i|is hot}} \u2192 {{Nihongo||\u71b1\u304b\u3063\u305f|atsu-katta|was hot}}.\n\nSome scholars, such as [[Eleanor Harz Jorden]], refer to adjectives instead as '''adjectivals''', since they are grammatically distinct from adjectives: they can [[Predicate (grammar)|predicate]] a sentence. That is, {{Nihongo||\u71b1\u3044|atsui}} is glossed as \"hot\" when modifying a noun phrase, as in {{Nihongo||\u71b1\u3044\u3054\u98ef|atsui gohan|hot food}}, but as \"''is'' hot\" when predicating, as in {{Nihongo||\u3054\u98ef\u306f\u71b1\u3044|gohan wa atsui|[the] food is hot}}.\n\nThe two [[inflection|inflected]] classes, verb and adjective, are [[closed class]]es, meaning they do not readily gain new members.<ref>[[#Uehara|Uehara]], p. 69</ref>{{sfn|Dixon|1977|p=48}} Instead, new and borrowed verbs and adjectives are conjugated [[periphrasis|periphrastically]] as verbal noun + ''suru'' (e.g. {{Nihongo||\u52c9\u5f37\u3059\u308b|benky\u014d suru|do studying; study}}) and adjectival noun + ''na''. This differs from [[Indo-European languages]], where verbs and adjectives are [[Open class (linguistics)|open classes]], though analogous \"do\" constructions exist, including English \"do a favor\", \"do the twist\" or French \"faire un footing\" (do a \"footing\", go for a jog), and periphrastic constructions are common for other senses, like \"try climbing\" (verbal noun) or \"try parkour\" (noun). Other languages where verbs are a closed class include [[Basque language|Basque]]: new [[Basque verbs]] are only formed periphrastically. Conversely, pronouns are closed classes in Western languages but open classes in Japanese and some other [[East Asian languages]].\n\nIn a few cases new verbs are created by appending {{Nihongo||\u301c\u308b|-ru}} to a noun or using it to replace the end of a word. This is most often done with borrowed words, and results in a word written in a mixture of katakana (stem) and hiragana (inflectional ending), which is otherwise very rare.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://japaneselevelup.com/homage-to-\u308bru-the-magical-verbifier/ |title=Homage to \u308b(ru), The Magical Verbifier |date= 2011-07-18 |author=[http://japaneselevelup.com/author/adshap8/ Adam]}}</ref> This is typically casual, with the most well-established example being {{Nihongo||[[:ja:\u30b5\u30dc\u308b|\u30b5\u30dc\u308b]]|sabo-ru|cut class; play hooky}} (circa 1920), from {{Nihongo||\u30b5\u30dc\u30bf\u30fc\u30b8\u30e5|sabot\u0101ju|sabotage}}, with other common examples including {{Nihongo||\u30e1\u30e2\u308b|memo-ru|write a memo}}, from {{Nihongo||\u30e1\u30e2|memo|memo}}, and {{Nihongo||\u30df\u30b9\u308b|misu-ru|make a mistake}} from {{Nihongo||\u30df\u30b9|misu|mistake}}.

Japanese adjectives are unusual in being closed class but quite numerous \u2013 about 700 adjectives \u2013 while most languages with closed class adjectives have very few.<ref>''The Typology of Adjectival Predication,'' Harrie Wetzer, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ORUUwhdDPpUC&pg=PA311 p. 311]</ref><ref name=\"guide96\">''The Art of Grammar: A Practical Guide,'' Alexandra Y. Aikhenvald, [https://books.google.com/books?id=XFBVBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA96 p. 96]</ref> Some believe this is due to a grammatical change of inflection from an aspect system to a tense system, with adjectives predating the change.\n\nThe [[Grammatical conjugation|conjugation]] of ''i''-adjectives has similarities to the conjugation of verbs, unlike Western languages where inflection of adjectives, where it exists, is more likely to have similarities to the [[declension]] of nouns. Verbs and adjectives being closely related is unusual from the perspective of English, but is a common case across languages generally, and one may consider Japanese adjectives as a kind of [[stative verb]].\n\nJapanese vocabulary has a large layer of [[Sino-Japanese vocabulary|Chinese loanwords]], nearly all of which go back more than one thousand years, yet virtually none of them are verbs or \"''i''-adjectives\" \u2013 they are all nouns, of which some are verbal nouns (''suru'') and some are adjectival nouns (''na''). In addition to the basic verbal noun + ''suru'' form, verbal nouns with a single-character root often experienced sound changes, such as {{Nihongo||\u301c\u3059\u308b|-suru}} \u2192 {{Nihongo||\u301c\u305a\u308b|-zuru}} \u2192 {{Nihongo||\u301c\u3058\u308b|-jiru}}, as in {{Nihongo||\u7981\u3058\u308b|kin-jiru|forbid}}, and some cases where the stem underwent sound change, as in {{Nihongo||\u9054\u3059\u308b|tassuru|reach}}, from {{Nihongo||\u9054|tatsu}}.\n\nVerbal nouns are uncontroversially nouns, having only minor syntactic differences to distinguish them from pure nouns like 'mountain'. There are some minor distinctions within verbal nouns, most notably that some primarily conjugate as {{Nihongo||\u301c\u3092\u3059\u308b|-wo suru}} (with a particle), more like nouns, while others primarily conjugate as {{Nihongo||\u301c\u3059\u308b|-suru}}, and others are common either way. For example, {{Nihongo||\u7d4c\u9a13\u3092\u3059\u308b|keiken wo suru|to experience}} is much more common than {{Nihongo||\u7d4c\u9a13\u3059\u308b|keiken suru}}, while {{Nihongo||\u52d8\u5f01\u3059\u308b|kanben suru|to pardon}} is much more common than {{Nihongo||\u52d8\u5f01\u3092\u3059\u308b|kanben wo suru}}.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://aveneca.com/cbb/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=3855 |title=Closed and open classes in Natlangs (Especially Japanese) |access-date=February 22, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150222070657/http://aveneca.com/cbb/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=3855 |archive-date=February 22, 2015 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Nominal adjectives have more syntactic differences versus pure nouns, and traditionally were considered more separate, but they, too, are ultimately a subcategory of nouns.\n\nThere are a few minor word classes that are related to adjectival nouns, namely the [[taru adjective|''taru'' adjectives]] and [[naru adjective|''naru'' adjectives]]. Of these, ''naru'' adjectives are fossils of earlier forms of ''na'' adjectives (the ''nari'' adjectives of Old Japanese), and are typically classed separately, while ''taru'' adjectives are a parallel class (formerly ''tari'' adjectives in Late Old Japanese), but are typically classed with ''na'' adjectives.\n\n===Japanese as a topic-prominent language===\nIn [[discourse]] [[pragmatics]], the term ''topic'' refers to what a section of discourse is about. At the beginning of a section of discourse, the topic is usually unknown, in which case it is usually necessary to explicitly mention it. As the discourse carries on, the topic need not be the grammatical subject of each new sentence.\n\nStarting with Middle Japanese, the grammar evolved so as to explicitly distinguish topics from nontopics. This is done by two distinct [[Japanese particles|particles]] (short words which do not change form). Consider the following pair of sentences:\n:\u592a\u967d'''\u304c'''\u6607\u308b\u3002\n:''taiy\u014d ''ga'' noboru''\n:sun <small>NONTOPIC</small> rise\n:\u592a\u967d'''\u306f'''\u6607\u308b\u3002\n:''taiy\u014d ''wa'' noboru''\n:sun <small>TOPIC</small> rise\nBoth sentences translate as \"the sun rises\". In the first sentence the sun (\u592a\u967d ''taiy\u014d'') is not a discourse topic\u2014not yet; in the second sentence it now ''is'' a discourse topic. In linguistics (specifically, in discourse pragmatics) a sentence such as the second one (with ''wa'') is termed a '''presentational''' sentence because its function in the discourse is to present ''sun'' as a topic, to \"broach it for discussion\". Once a [[referent]] has been established as the topic of the current monolog or dialog, then in (formal) modern Japanese its marking will change from ''ga'' to ''wa''. To better explain the difference, the translation of the second sentence can be enlarged to \"As for the sun, it rises\" or \"Speaking of the sun, it rises\"; these renderings reflect a discourse fragment in which \"the sun\" is being established as the topic of an extended discussion.\n\n===Liberal omission of the subject of a sentence===\nThe grammatical [[Subject (grammar)|subject]] is [[null-subject language|commonly omitted]] in Japanese, as in\n:\u65e5\u672c\u306b\u884c\u304d\u307e\u3057\u305f\n:''nihon ni ikimashita''\n:Japan <small>LATIVE</small> go-<small>POLITE</small>-<small>PERFECT</small>\nThe sentence literally expresses \"went to Japan\". Subjects are mentioned when a topic is introduced, or in situations where an ambiguity might result from their omission. The preceding example sentence would most likely be uttered in the middle of a discourse, where who it is that \"went to Japan\" will be clear from what has already been said (or written).\n\n==Sentences, phrases and words==\n''Text'' (\u6587\u7ae0 ''bunsh\u014d'') is composed of ''[[Sentence (linguistics)|sentences]]'' (\u6587 ''bun''), which are in turn composed of ''[[phrase]]s'' (\u6587\u7bc0 ''bunsetsu''), which are its smallest coherent components. Like [[Chinese language|Chinese]] and classical [[Korean language|Korean]], written Japanese does not typically demarcate words with spaces; its agglutinative nature further makes the concept of a ''[[word]]'' rather different from words in [[English language|English]]. The reader identifies word divisions by semantic cues and a knowledge of phrase structure. Phrases have a ''single'' meaning-bearing word, followed by a string of [[suffix]]es, [[auxiliary verb]]s and [[Grammatical particle|particles]] to modify its meaning and designate its grammatical role. In the following example, phrases are indicated by vertical bars:\n:\u592a\u967d\u304c\uff5c\u6771\u306e\uff5c\u7a7a\u306b\uff5c\u6607\u308b\u3002\n:''taiy\u014d ga'' | ''higashi no'' | ''sora ni'' | ''noboru''\n:sun <small>SUBJECT</small> | east <small>POSSESSIVE</small> | sky <small>LOCATIVE</small> | rise\n:The sun rises in the eastern sky.\n\nSome scholars [[Romanization|romanize]] Japanese sentences by inserting spaces only at phrase boundaries (''i.e.'', \"''taiy\u014d-ga higashi-no sora-ni noboru''\"), treating an entire phrase as a single word. This represents an almost purely phonological conception of where one word ends and the next begins. There is some validity in taking this approach: [[phonology|phonologically]], the [[Preposition and postposition|postpositional]] particles [[Clitic|merge with the structural word that precedes them]], and within a ''phonological'' phrase, the [[Japanese pitch accent|pitch]] can have at most one fall. Usually, however, grammarians adopt a more conventional concept of ''word'' (\u5358\u8a9e ''tango''), one which invokes meaning and sentence structure.\n\n==Word classification==\nIn linguistics generally, words and affixes are often classified into two major word categories: [[lexical word|'''lexical''' words]], those that refer to the world outside of a discourse, and [[function word|'''function''' words]]\u2014also including fragments of words\u2014which help to build the sentence in accordance with the grammar rules of the language. Lexical words include nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, and sometimes prepositions and postpositions, while grammatical words or word parts include everything else. The native tradition in Japanese grammar scholarship seems to concur in this view of classification. This native Japanese tradition uses the terminology {{Nihongo||\u81ea\u7acb\u8a9e|jiritsugo|extra=\u201cindependent words\u201d}}, for words having lexical meaning, and {{Nihongo||\u4ed8\u5c5e\u8a9e|fuzokugo|extra=\u201cauxiliary words\u201d}}, for words having a grammatical function.\n\nClassical Japanese had some auxiliary verbs (i.e., they were independent words) which have become grammaticized in modern Japanese as inflectional suffixes, such as the past tense suffix ''-ta'' (which might have developed as a contraction of ''-te ari'').\n\nTraditional scholarship proposes a system of word classes differing somewhat from the above-mentioned.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} The \"independent\" words have the following categories.\n:{{Nihongo||\u6d3b\u7528\u8a9e|katsuy\u014dgo}}, word classes which have inflections\n::{{Nihongo||\u52d5\u8a5e|d\u014dshi}}, verbs,\n::{{Nihongo||\u5f62\u5bb9\u8a5e|keiy\u014dshi}}, ''i''-type adjectives.\n::{{Nihongo||\u5f62\u5bb9\u52d5\u8a5e|keiy\u014dd\u014dshi}}, ''na''-type adjectives\n\n:{{Nihongo||\u975e\u6d3b\u7528\u8a9e|hikatsuy\u014dgo}} or {{Nihongo||mukatsuy\u014dgo|\u7121\u6d3b\u7528\u8a9e}}, word classes which do not have inflections{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}\n::{{Nihongo||\u540d\u8a5e|meishi}}, nouns\n::{{Nihongo||\u4ee3\u540d\u8a5e|daimeishi}}, pronouns\n::{{Nihongo||\u526f\u8a5e|fukushi}}, adverbs\n::{{Nihongo||\u63a5\u7d9a\u8a5e|setsuzokushi}}, conjunctions\n::{{Nihongo||\u611f\u52d5\u8a5e|kand\u014dshi}}, interjections\n::{{Nihongo||\u9023\u4f53\u8a5e|rentaishi}}, prenominals\n\nAncillary words also divide into a nonconjugable class, containing  grammatical particles (\u52a9\u8a5e ''joshi'') and [[Japanese counter word|counter words]] (\u52a9\u6570\u8a5e ''jos\u016bshi''), and a conjugable class consisting of auxiliary verbs (\u52a9\u52d5\u8a5e ''jod\u014dshi''). There is not wide agreement among linguists as to the English translations of the above terms.\n\n===Controversy over the characterization of nominal adjectives===\nUehara (1998)<ref>[[#Uehara|Uehara]], chapter 2, especially \u00a72.2.2.2</ref> observes that Japanese grammarians have disagreed as to the criteria that make some words \"inflectional\", ''katsuy\u014d'', and others not, in particular, the \u5f62\u5bb9\u52d5\u8a5e   ''keiy\u014dd\u014dshi'' \u2013 \"''na''-adjectives\" or \"''na''-nominals\". (It is not disputed that nouns like 'book' and 'mountain' are noninflectional and that verbs and ''i''-adjectives are inflectional.) The claim that ''na''-adjectives are inflectional rests on the claim that the syllable ''da'' 'is', usually regarded as a \"copula verb\", is really a suffix\u2014an inflection. Thus ''hon'' 'book', generates a one-word sentence, ''honda'' 'it is a book', not a two-word sentence, ''hon da''. However, numerous constructions seem to be incompatible with the suffixal copula claim.\n\n:(1) Reduplication for emphasis\n::''Hora! Hon, hon!'' 'See, it ''is'' a book!'\n::''Hora! Kirei, kirei!'' 'See, it ''is'' pretty!'\n::''Hora! Furui, furui!'' 'See, it ''is'' old!' (the adjectival inflection -''i'' cannot be left off)\n::''Hora! Iku, iku!'' 'See, it ''does'' go!' (the verbal inflection -''u'' cannot be left off)\n\n:(2) Questions. In Japanese, questions are formed by adding the particle ''ka'' (or in colloquial speech, just by changing the intonation of the sentence).\n::''Hon/kirei ka?'' 'Is it a book? ; Is it pretty?'\n::''Furu-i/Ik-u ka?'' 'Is it old? ; Does it go?' (the inflections cannot be left off)\n\n:(3) Several auxiliary verbs, e.g., ''mitai'', 'looks like it's'\n::''Hon mitai da; Kirei mitai da'' 'It seems to be a book; It seems to be pretty'\n::''Furu-i mitai da; Ik-u mitai da'' 'It seems to be old; It seems to go'\n\nOn the basis of such constructions, Uehara (1998) finds that the copula is indeed an independent word, and that regarding the parameters on which ''i''-adjectives share the syntactic pattern of verbs, the nominal adjectives pattern with pure nouns instead.\n\nSimilarly, [[Eleanor Jorden]] considers this class of words a kind of nominal, not adjective, and refers to them as ''na''-nominals in her textbook ''[[Japanese: The Spoken Language]].''\n\n==Nouns==\n{{see also|Honorific speech in Japanese}}\nJapanese has no [[grammatical gender]], [[grammatical number|number]], or [[article (grammar)|article]]s (though the demonstrative {{lang|ja|\u305d\u306e}}, {{transl|ja|sono}}, \"that, those\", is often translatable as \"the\"). Thus, specialists{{who|date=September 2015}} have agreed that Japanese [[noun]]s are [[inflection|noninflecting]]: {{lang|ja|\u732b}} {{transl|ja|neko}} can be translated as \"cat\", \"cats\", \"a cat\", \"the cat\", \"some cats\" and so forth, depending on context. However, as part of the extensive pair of grammatical systems that Japanese possesses for ''honorification'' (making discourse deferential to the addressee or even to a third party) and politeness, nouns too can be modified. Nouns take politeness prefixes (which have not been regarded as inflections): ''o-'' for native nouns, and ''go-'' for Sino-Japanese nouns. A few examples are given in the following table. In a few cases, there is [[suppletion]], as with the first of the examples given below, 'rice'. (Note that while these prefixes are almost always in ''[[Hiragana]]''&nbsp;\u2014 that is, as {{lang|ja|\u304a}}  {{transl|ja|o-}} or {{lang|ja|\u3054}} {{transl|ja|go}}&nbsp;\u2014 the ''[[kanji]]'' {{lang|ja|\u5fa1}} is used for both ''o'' and ''go'' prefixes in formal writing.)\n\n<div style=\"margin-left: 2em; float: right;\">\n{| class=\"wikitable\" <!-- border=\"1\" cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" -->\n|+ Respectful forms of nouns\n! meaning !! plain !! respectful\n|-\n| meal || {{lang|ja|\u98ef}} {{transl|ja|meshi}} || {{lang|ja|\u3054\u98ef}} {{transl|ja|go-han}}\n|-\n| money || {{lang|ja|\u91d1}} {{transl|ja|kane}} || {{lang|ja|\u304a\u91d1}} {{transl|ja|o-kane}}\n|-\n| body || {{lang|ja|\u4f53}} {{transl|ja|karada}} || {{lang|ja|\u304a\u4f53}} {{transl|ja|o-karada}}<br>{{lang|ja|\u5fa1\u8eab}} {{transl|ja|onmi}}\n|-\n| word(s) || {{lang|ja|\u8a00\u8449}} {{transl|ja|kotoba}} || {{lang|ja|\u304a\u8a00\u8449}} {{transl|ja|o-kotoba}}<br>{{lang|ja|\u8a54}} {{transl|ja|mikotonori}}\n|}\n</div>\nLacking number, Japanese does not differentiate between [[count noun|count]] and [[mass noun]]s. (An English speaker learning Japanese would be well advised to treat Japanese nouns as mass nouns.) A small number of nouns have [[collective number|collective]]s formed by [[reduplication]] (possibly accompanied by voicing and related processes ([[rendaku]])); for example: ''hito'' 'person' and ''hitobito'' 'people'. Reduplication is not [[productivity (linguistics)|productive]]. Words in Japanese referring to more than one of something are collectives, not [[plural]]s. ''Hitobito'', for example, means \"a lot of people\" or \"people in general\". It is never used to mean \"two people\". A phrase like ''edo no hitobito'' would be taken to mean \"the people of [[Edo]]\", or \"the population of Edo\", not \"two people from Edo\" or even \"a few people from Edo\". Similarly, ''yamayama'' means \"many mountains\".\n\nA limited number of nouns have collective forms that refer to groups of people. Examples include ''watashi-tachi'', 'we'; ''anata-tachi'', 'you (plural)'; ''bokura'', 'we (less formal, more masculine)'. One uncommon personal noun, ''ware'', 'I', or in some cases, 'you', has a much more common reduplicative collective form ''wareware'' 'we'.\n\nThe suffixes ''-tachi'' (\u9054) and ''-ra'' (\u7b49) are by far the most common collectivizing suffixes. These are, again, not pluralizing suffixes: ''tar\u014d-tachi'' does not mean \"some number of people named Taro\", but instead indicates the group including Taro. Depending on context, ''tar\u014d-tachi'' might be translated into \"Taro and his friends\", \"Taro and his siblings\", \"Taro and his family\", or any other logical grouping that has Taro as the representative. Some words with collectives have become fixed phrases and (commonly) refer to one person. Specifically, ''kodomo'' 'child' and ''tomodachi'' 'friend' can be singular, even though ''-[t]omo'' and ''-[t]achi'' were originally collectivizing in these words; to unambiguously refer to groups of them, an additional collectivizing suffix is added: ''kodomotachi'' 'children' and ''tomodachitachi'' 'friends', though ''tomodachitachi'' is somewhat uncommon. ''Tachi'' is sometimes applied to inanimate objects, ''kuruma'' 'car' and ''kuruma-tachi'', 'cars', for example, but this usage is colloquial and indicates a high level of anthropomorphisation and childlikeness, and is not more generally accepted as standard.\n\n===Grammatical case===\n\n[[Grammatical case]]s in Japanese are marked by [[Japanese particles|particles]] placed after the nouns.<ref name=\"tarou takahashi\">{{cite book|last=Takahashi|first=Tarou|title=A Japanese Grammar|year=2010|publisher=Hitsuji Shobou|location=Japan|isbn=978-4-89476-244-2|page=27|display-authors=etal|language=Japanese|edition=4}}</ref> A distinctive feature of Japanese is the presence of two cases which are roughly equivalent to the nominative case in other languages: one representing the [[Topic and comment|sentence topic]], other representing the subject.

(''Daimeishi'' can be considered a subset of nouns.) Strictly speaking, pronouns do not take modifiers{{Citation needed|date=September 2019}}, but Japanese ''daimeishi'' do: \u80cc\u306e\u9ad8\u3044\u5f7c ''se no takai kare'' (lit. tall he) is valid in Japanese. Also, unlike true pronouns, Japanese ''daimeishi'' are not [[closed-class word|closed-class]]: new ''daimeishi'' are introduced and old ones go out of use relatively quickly.\n\nA large number of ''daimeishi'' referring to people are translated as pronouns in their most common uses. Examples: \u5f7c  ''kare'', (he); \u5f7c\u5973  ''kanojo'', (she); \u79c1  ''watashi'', (I); see also the adjoining table or a longer list.<ref>[http://www.sljfaq.org/afaq/pronoun.html \"What are the personal pronouns of Japanese?\"] in ''sci.lang.japan Frequently Asked Questions''</ref> Some of these \"personal nouns\" such as \u5df1 ''onore'', I (exceedingly humble), or \u50d5 ''boku'', I (young male), also have second-person uses: \u304a\u306e\u308c  ''onore'' in second-person is an extremely rude \"you\", and ''boku'' in second-person is a diminutive \"you\" used for young boys. ''Kare'' and ''kanojo'' also mean \"boyfriend\" and \"girlfriend\" respectively, and this usage of the words is possibly more common than the use as pronouns.\n\nLike other [[subject (grammar)|subject]]s, Japanese deemphasizes personal ''daimeishi'', which are seldom used. This is partly because Japanese sentences do not always require explicit subjects, and partly because names or titles are often used where pronouns would appear in a translation:\n:\u300c\u6728\u4e0b\u3055\u3093\u306f\u3001\u80cc\u304c\u9ad8\u3044\u3067\u3059\u306d\u3002\u300d\n:''Kinoshita-san wa, se ga takai desu ne.''\n: (addressing Mr. Kinoshita) \"You're pretty tall, aren't you?\"\n:\u300c\u5c02\u52d9\u3001\u660e\u65e5\u798f\u5ca1\u5e02\u897f\u533a\u306e\u5c71\u672c\u5546\u4e8b\u306e\u793e\u9577\u306b\u4f1a\u3063\u3066\u3044\u305f\u3060\u3051\u307e\u3059\u304b\uff1f\u300d\n:''Semmu, asu Fukuoka-shi nishi-ku no Yamamoto-sh\u014dji no shach\u014d ni atte itadakemasu ka?''\n: (addressing the managing director) \"Would it be possible for you to meet the president of Yamamoto Trading Co. in [[Nishi-ku, Fukuoka|West Ward, Fukuoka]] tomorrow?\"\n\nThe possible referents of ''daimeishi'' are sometimes constrained depending on the order of occurrence. The following pair of examples from Bart Mathias<ref>Bart Mathias. [http://groups-beta.google.com/group/sci.lang.japan/msg/fed63fa6c3614895?dmode=source Discussion of pronoun reference constraints] on sci.lang.japan.</ref> illustrates one such constraint.\n:''Honda-kun ni atte, kare no hon o kaeshita'' (\u672c\u7530\u541b\u306b\u4f1a\u3063\u3066\u3001\u5f7c\u306e\u672c\u3092\u8fd4\u3057\u305f\u3002)\n:(I) met Honda and returned his book.

(Here, \"him\" ''cannot'' refer to Honda.)\n\n===Reflexive pronouns===\nEnglish has a reflexive form of each [[personal pronoun]] (''himself'', ''herself'', ''itself'', ''themselves'', etc.); Japanese, in contrast, has one main reflexive ''daimeishi'', namely ''jibun'' (\u81ea\u5206), which can also mean 'I'. The uses of the reflexive (pro)nouns in the two languages are very different, as demonstrated by the following literal translations (*=impossible, ??=ambiguous):\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"margin-left: 2em;\"\n! English !! Japanese !! reason\n|- valign=\"top\"\n| History repeats itself.\n| *''Rekishi wa jibun o kurikaesu.''

The use of ''jibun'' in complex sentences follows non-trivial rules.\n\nThere are also equivalents to ''jibun'' such as ''mizukara''. Other uses of the [[reflexive pronoun]] in English are covered by adverbs like ''hitorideni'' which is used in the sense of \"by oneself\". For example,\n:\u6a5f\u68b0\u304c\u3072\u3068\u308a\u3067\u306b\u52d5\u304d\u51fa\u3057\u305f\n:''kikai ga hitorideni ugokidashita''\n:\"The machine started operating by itself.\"\n\nChange in a verb's [[Valency (linguistics)|valency]] is not accomplished by use of reflexive pronouns (in this Japanese is like English but unlike many other European languages). Instead, separate (but usually related) [[intransitive verb]]s and [[transitive verb]]s are used. There is no longer any productive morphology to derive transitive verbs from intransitive ones, or vice versa.{{clarify|date=March 2020}}\n\n===Demonstratives===\n<div style=\"margin-left: 2em; float: right\">\n{| class=\"wikitable\" <!-- cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" border=\"1\" -->\n|+ Demonstratives\n!\n!

The ''ko-'' (proximal) series refers to things closer to the speaker than the hearer, the ''so-'' (medial) series for things closer to the hearer, and the ''a-'' (distal) series for things distant to both the speaker and the hearer. With ''do-'', demonstratives turn into the corresponding interrogative form. Demonstratives can also be used to refer to people, for example\n:\u300c\u3053\u3061\u3089\u306f\u6797\u3055\u3093\u3067\u3059\u3002\u300d\n:''Kochira wa Hayashi-san desu.''\n:\"This is Mr. Hayashi.\"\n\nDemonstratives limit, and therefore precede, nouns; thus \u3053\u306e\u672c  ''kono hon'' for \"this/my book\", and \u305d\u306e\u672c  ''sono hon'' for \"that/your book\".\n\nWhen demonstratives are used to refer to things not visible to the speaker or the hearer, or to (abstract) concepts, they fulfill a related but different [[Anaphora (linguistics)|anaphoric]] role. The anaphoric distals are used for shared information between the speaker and the listener.\n:A\uff1a\u5148\u65e5\u3001\u672d\u5e4c\u306b\u884c\u3063\u3066\u6765\u307e\u3057\u305f\u3002\n:''A: Senjitsu, Sapporo ni itte kimashita.''\n:A: I visited Sapporo recently.\n:B\uff1a\u3042\u305d\u3053(*\u305d\u3053)\u306f\u3044\u3064\u884c\u3063\u3066\u3082\u3044\u3044\u6240\u3067\u3059\u306d\u3002\n:''B: Asoko (*Soko) wa itsu itte mo ii tokoro desu ne.''\n:B: Yeah, that's a great place to visit whenever you go.\n\n''Soko'' instead of ''asoko'' would imply that B doesn't share this knowledge about Sapporo, which is inconsistent with the meaning of the sentence. The anaphoric medials are used to refer to experience or knowledge that is not shared between the speaker and listener.\n:\u4f50\u85e4\uff1a\u7530\u4e2d\u3068\u3044\u3046\u4eba\u304c\u6628\u65e5\u6b7b\u3093\u3060\u3093\u3060\u3063\u3066\u3002\n:''Sat\u014d : Tanaka to iu hito ga kin\u014d shinda n da tte...

The [[Anatomical terms of location#Proximal and distal|proximal]] demonstratives do not have clear anaphoric uses. They can be used in situations where the distal series sound too disconnected:\n:\u4e00\u4f53\u4f55\u3067\u3059\u304b\u3001\u3053\u308c(*\u3042\u308c)\u306f?\n:''Ittai nan desu ka, kore (*are) wa?''\n:What on earth is this?\n\n==Conjugable words==\n\n===Stem forms===\nPrior to discussing the conjugable words, a brief note about ''stem forms''. Conjugative suffixes and auxiliary verbs are attached to the stem forms of the affixee. In modern Japanese there are the following six stem forms.\n\nNote that this order follows from the ''-a, -i, -u, -e, -o'' endings that these forms have in \u4e94\u6bb5 (5-row) verbs (according to the \u3042\u3001\u3044\u3001\u3046\u3001\u3048\u3001\u304a collation order of Japanese), where terminal and attributive forms are the same for verbs (hence only 5 surface forms), but differ for nominals, notably ''na''-nominals.\n; ''Irrealis form'' (\u672a\u7136\u5f62 ''mizenkei'') ''-a'' (and ''-\u014d''): is used for plain negative (of verbs), causative and passive constructions. The most common use of this form is with the ''-nai'' auxiliary that turns verbs into their negative (predicate) form. (See Verbs below.) The ''-\u014d'' version is used for volitional expression and formed by a euphonic change (\u97f3\u4fbf onbin).\n; ''Continuative form'' (\u9023\u7528\u5f62 ''ren'y\u014dkei'') ''-i'': is used in a linking role (a kind of [[serial verb construction]]). This is the most productive stem form, taking on a variety of endings and auxiliaries, and can even occur independently in a sense similar to the ''-te'' ending. This form is also used to negate adjectives.\n; ''Terminal form'' (\u7d42\u6b62\u5f62 ''sh\u016bshikei'') ''-u'': is used at the ends of clauses in [[predicate (grammar)|predicate]] positions. This form is also variously known as ''plain form'' (\u57fa\u672c\u5f62 ''kihonkei'') or ''[[dictionary form]]'' (\u8f9e\u66f8\u5f62 ''jishokei'') \u2013 it is the form that verbs are listed under in a dictionary.\n; ''[[Attributive verb#Japanese|Attributive form]]'' ({{visible anchor|\u9023\u4f53\u5f62}} ''rentaikei'') ''-u'': is prefixed to nominals and is used to define or classify the noun, similar to a [[relative clause]] in English. In modern Japanese it is practically identical to the terminal form, except that verbs are generally not inflected for politeness; in old Japanese these forms differed. Further, ''na''-nominals behave differently in terminal and attributive positions; see [[#Adjectives|adjectives]], below.\n; ''Hypothetical form'' (\u4eee\u5b9a\u5f62 ''kateikei'') ''-e'': is used for conditional and subjunctive forms, using the ''-ba'' ending.\n; ''Imperative form'' (\u547d\u4ee4\u5f62 ''meireikei'') ''-e'': is used to turn verbs into commands. Adjectives do not have an imperative stem form.\n\nThe application of conjugative suffixes to stem forms follow certain euphonic principles (\u97f3\u4fbf ''onbin''), which are discussed below.\n\n===Verbs===\n{{Main|Japanese verb conjugation}}\n\nVerbs (\u52d5\u8a5e ''d\u014dshi'') in Japanese are rigidly constrained to the ends of clauses in what is known as the ''predicate position''. This means that the verb is always located at the end of a sentence.\n{| cellpadding=\"2px\" style=\"margin-left: 2em;\"\n|-\n| \u732b || \u306f || \u9b5a || \u3092 || \u98df\u3079\u308b\u3002\n|-\n| ''neko'' || ''wa'' || ''sakana'' || ''o'' || ''taberu''\n|-\n| Cats || TOPIC || fish || OBJECT || eat\n|-\n|colspan=\"5\"| Cats eat fish.\n|}\nThe subject and objects of the verb are indicated by means of ''[[Japanese grammar#Particles|particles]]'', and the grammatical functions of the verb&nbsp;\u2014 primarily tense and voice&nbsp;\u2014 are indicated by means of [[Grammatical conjugation|conjugation]]. When the subject and the dissertative topic coincide, the subject is often omitted; if the verb is intransitive, the entire sentence may consist of a single verb. Verbs have two tenses indicated by conjugation, past and nonpast. The semantic difference between present and future is not indicated by means of conjugation. Usually there is no ambiguity as context makes it clear whether the speaker is referring to the present or future. Voice and aspect are also indicated by means of conjugation, and possibly agglutinating auxiliary verbs. For example, the continuative aspect is formed by means of the continuative conjugation known as the ''gerundive'' or ''[[te form of Japanese verb|-te form]]'', and the auxiliary verb ''iru'' \"to be\"; to illustrate, \u898b\u308b  ''miru'' (\"to see\") \u2192 \u898b\u3066\u3044\u308b  ''mite iru'' (\"to be seeing\").\n\nVerbs can be semantically classified based on certain conjugations.\n; Stative verbs: indicate existential properties, such as \"to be\" (\u3044\u308b ''iru''), \"to be able to do\" (\u51fa\u6765\u308b ''dekiru''), \"to need\" (\u8981\u308b ''iru''), etc. These verbs generally do not have a continuative conjugation with ''-iru'' because they are semantically continuative already.\n; Continual verbs: conjugate with the auxiliary ''-iru'' to indicate the progressive aspect. Examples: \"to eat\" (\u98df\u3079\u308b ''taberu''), \"to drink\" (\u98f2\u3080 ''nomu''), \"to think\" (\u8003\u3048\u308b ''kangaeru''). To illustrate the conjugation, \u98df\u3079\u308b  ''taberu'' (\"to eat\") \u2192 \u98df\u3079\u3066\u3044\u308b  ''tabete iru'' (\"to be eating\").\n; Punctual verbs: conjugate with ''-iru'' to indicate a repeated action, or a continuing state after some action. Example: \u77e5\u308b  ''shiru'' (\"to know\") \u2192 \u77e5\u3063\u3066\u3044\u308b  ''shitte iru'' (\"to be knowing\"); \u6253\u3064  ''utsu'' (\"to hit\") \u2192 \u6253\u3063\u3066\u3044\u308b  ''utte iru'' (\"to be hitting (repeatedly)\").\n; Non-volitional verb: indicate uncontrollable action or emotion. These verbs generally have no volitional, imperative or potential conjugation. Examples: \u597d\u3080  ''konomu'', \"to like / to prefer\" (emotive), \u898b\u3048\u308b  ''mieru'', \"to be visible\" (non-emotive).\n; Movement verbs: indicate motion. Examples: \u6b69\u304f  ''aruku'' (\"to walk\"), \u5e30\u308b  ''kaeru'' (\"to return\"). In the continuative form (see below) they take the particle ''ni'' to indicate a purpose.\nThere are other possible classes, and a large amount of overlap between the classes.\n\nLexically, nearly every verb in Japanese is a member of exactly one of the following three regular ''conjugation groups'' (see also [[Japanese consonant and vowel verbs]]).\n; Group 2a (\u4e0a\u4e00\u6bb5 ''kami ichidan'', lit. upper 1-row group): verbs with a stem ending in ''i''. The terminal stem form always rhymes with ''-iru''. Examples: \u898b\u308b  ''miru'' (\"to see\"), \u7740\u308b  ''kiru'' (\"to wear\").\n; Group 2b (\u4e0b\u4e00\u6bb5 ''shimo ichidan'', lit. lower 1-row group): verbs with a stem ending in ''e''. The terminal stem form always rhymes with ''-eru''. Examples: \u98df\u3079\u308b  ''taberu'' (\"to eat\"), \u304f\u308c\u308b  ''kureru'' (\"to give\" (to someone of lower or more intimate status)). (Note that some Group 1 verbs resemble Group 2b verbs, but their stems end in ''r'', not ''e''.)\n; Group 1 (\u4e94\u6bb5 ''godan'', lit. 5-row group): verbs with a stem ending in a consonant. When this is ''r'' and the verb ends in ''-eru'', it is not apparent from the terminal form whether the verb is Group 1 or Group 2b, e.g. \u5e30\u308b  ''kaeru'' (\"to return\"). If the stem ends in ''w'', that sound only appears in before the final ''a'' of the [[irrealis]] form.\n\nThe \"row\" in the above classification means a row in the [[goj\u016bon]] table. \"Upper 1-row\" means the row that is one row above the center row (the u-row) i.e. i-row. \"Lower 1-row\" means the row that is one row below the center row (the u-row) i.e. e-row. \"5-row\" means the conjugation runs though all 5 rows of the [[goj\u016bon]] table. A conjugation is fully described by identifying both the row and the column in the [[goj\u016bon]] table. For example, \u898b\u308b  (''miru'', \"to see\") belongs to \u30de\u884c\u4e0a\u4e00\u6bb5\u6d3b\u7528 (ma-column i-row conjugation), \u98df\u3079\u308b  (''taberu'', \"to eat\") belongs to \u30d0\u884c\u4e0b\u4e00\u6bb5\u6d3b\u7528 (ba-column e-row conjugation), and \u5e30\u308b (''kaeru'', \"to return\") belongs to \u30e9\u884c\u4e94\u6bb5\u6d3b\u7528(ra-column 5-row conjugation).\n\nOne should avoid confusing verbs in \u30e9\u884c\u4e94\u6bb5\u6d3b\u7528 (ra-column 5-row conjugation) with verbs in \u4e0a\u4e00\u6bb5\u6d3b\u7528 (i-row conjugation) or \u4e0b\u4e00\u6bb5\u6d3b\u7528 (e-row conjugation). For example, \u5207\u308b  (''kiru'', \"to cut\") belongs to \u30e9\u884c\u4e94\u6bb5\u6d3b\u7528 (ra-column 5-row conjugation), whereas its homophone \u7740\u308b  (''kiru'', \"to wear\") belongs to \u30ab\u884c\u4e0a\u4e00\u6bb5\u6d3b\u7528 (ka-column i-row conjugation). Likewise, \u7df4\u308b  (''neru'', \"to knead\") belongs to \u30e9\u884c\u4e94\u6bb5\u6d3b\u7528 (ra-column 5-row conjugation), whereas its homophone \u5bdd\u308b  (''neru'', \"to sleep\") belongs to \u30ca\u884c\u4e0b\u4e00\u6bb5\u6d3b\u7528 (na-column e-row conjugation).\n\nHistorical note: classical Japanese had upper and lower 1- and 2-row groups and a 4-row group (\u4e0a\uff0f\u4e0b\u4e00\u6bb5 ''kami/shimo ichidan'', \u4e0a\uff0f\u4e0b\u4e8c\u6bb5 ''kami/shimo nidan'', and \u56db\u6bb5 ''yodan'', the ''nidan'' verbs becoming most of today's ''ichidan'' verbs (there were only a handful of ''kami ichidan'' verbs and only one single ''shimo ichidan'' verb in classical Japanese), and the ''yodan'' group, due to the writing reform in 1946 to write Japanese as it is pronounced, naturally became the modern ''godan'' verbs. Since verbs have migrated across groups in the history of the language, conjugation of classical verbs is not predictable from a knowledge of modern Japanese alone.\n\nOf the irregular classes, there are two:\n; ''sa''-group: which has only one member, \u3059\u308b  (''suru'', \"to do\"). In Japanese grammars these words are classified as \u30b5\u5909  ''sa-hen'', an abbreviation of \u30b5\u884c\u5909\u683c\u6d3b\u7528  ''sa-gy\u014d henkaku katsuy\u014d'', sa-row irregular conjugation).\n; ''ka''-group: which also has one member, \u6765\u308b  (''kuru'', \"to come\"). The Japanese name for this class is \u30ab\u884c\u5909\u683c\u6d3b\u7528  ''ka-gy\u014d henkaku katsuy\u014d'' or simply \u30ab\u5909  ''ka-hen''.\nClassical Japanese had two further irregular classes, the ''na''-group, which contained \u6b7b\u306c  (''shinu'', \"to die\") and \u5f80\u306c  (''inu'', \"to go\", \"to die\"), the ''ra''-group, which included such verbs as \u3042\u308a  ''ari'', the equivalent of modern ''aru'', as well as quite a number of extremely irregular verbs that cannot be classified.\n\nThe following table illustrates the stem forms of the above conjugation groups, with the root indicated with dots. For example, to find the hypothetical form of the group 1 verb \u66f8\u304f  ''kaku'', look in the second row to find its root, ''kak'', then in the hypothetical row to get the ending ''-e'', giving the stem form ''kake''. When there are multiple possibilities, they are listed in the order of increasing rarity.\n<div style=\"text-align: center;\">\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"| group/<br />example\n!colspan=\"2\"| 1\n! 2a\n! 2b\n!rowspan=\"2\"| ''sa''\n!rowspan=\"2\"| ''ka''\n|-\n! \u4f7f\u30fb  ''tsuka(w).''\n! \u66f8\u30fb  ''kak.''\n! \u898b\u30fb  ''mi.''\n! \u98df\u3079\u30fb  ''tabe.''\n|-\n!

In modern Japanese the -''o'' form is used only for the volitional mood and the -''a'' form is used in all other cases; see also the conjugation table below.\n# The unexpected ending is due to the verb's root being ''tsukaw-'' but [w] only being pronounced before [a] in modern Japanese.\n\nThe above are only the stem forms of the verbs; to these one must add various verb endings in order to get the fully conjugated verb.

For example, a common formation is the ''causative-passive'' ending, ''-sase-rareru''.\n:\u50d5\u306f\u59c9\u306b\u7d0d\u8c46\u3092\u98df\u3079\u3055\u305b\u3089\u308c\u305f\u3002\n:''Boku wa ane ni natt\u014d o tabe'''saserareta'''.''\n:I '''was made to''' eat ''[[natt\u014d]]'' by my (elder) sister.\nAs should be expected, the vast majority of theoretically possible combinations of conjugative endings are not semantically meaningful.\n\n====Transitive and intransitive verbs====\nJapanese has a large variety of related pairs of [[transitive verb]]s (that take a direct object) and [[intransitive verb]]s (that do not ''usually'' take a direct object), such as the transitive ''hajimeru'' (\u59cb\u3081\u308b, someone or something begins an activity), and the intransitive ''hajimaru'' (\u59cb\u307e\u308b, an activity begins).<ref>[http://www.sljfaq.org/afaq/jitadoushi.html \"What's the difference between hajimeru and hajimaru?\"] in ''sci.lang.japan Frequently Asked Questions''</ref><ref>Kim Allen (2000) [http://kimallen.sheepdogdesign.net/Japanese/verbs2.html \"Japanese verbs, part 2\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070810194203/http://kimallen.sheepdogdesign.net/Japanese/verbs2.html |date=2007-08-10 }} in ''Japanese for the Western Brain''</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n! transitive verb\n! intransitive verb\n|-\n| One thing acts out the transitive verb on another.\n*Usually uses \u3092 ''o'' to link to the direct object.\n| The intransitive verb passively happens without direct intervention.\n*Usually uses \u304c ''ga'' or \u306f ''wa'' to link subject and verb.\n|-\n|\n:\u5148\u751f \u304c \u6388\u696d \u3092 \u59cb\u3081\u308b\u3002\n:''Sensei ga jugy\u014d o hajimeru.''\n:The teacher starts the class.\n|\n:\u6388\u696d \u304c \u59cb\u307e\u308b\u3002\n:''Jugy\u014d ga hajimaru.''\n:The class starts.\n|-\n|\n:\u8eca \u306b \u5165\u308c\u308b\n:''Kuruma ni ireru''\n:To put in the car\n|\n:\u8eca \u306b \u5165\u308b\n:''Kuruma ni hairu''\n:To enter the car\n|-\n|\n:\u51fa\u3059 ''dasu'' 'to take/put out' \n:\u6d88\u3059 ''kesu'' 'to extinguish'\n:\u958b\u3051\u308b ''akeru'' 'to open [something]'\n:\u4ed8\u3051\u308b ''tsukeru'' 'to attach [something]'\n:\u9589\u3081\u308b ''shimeru'' 'to close [something]'\n:\u898b\u3064\u3051\u308b ''mitsukeru'' 'to find'\n:\u629c\u304f ''nuku'' 'to extract'\n:\u8d77\u3053\u3059 ''okosu'' 'to wake [someone] up'\n:\u751f\u3080 ''umu'' 'to give birth'\n| \n:\u51fa\u308b ''deru'' 'to exit'\n:\u6d88\u3048\u308b ''kieru'' 'to go out'\n:\u958b\u304f''aku'' 'to open' 'to be open'\n:\u4ed8\u304f ''tsuku'' 'to attach' 'to be attached'\n:\u9589\u307e\u308b ''shimaru'' 'to close' 'to be closed'\n:\u898b\u3064\u304b\u308b ''mitsukaru'' 'to be found'\n:\u629c\u3051\u308b ''nukeru'' 'to come out'\n:\u8d77\u304d\u308b ''okiru'' 'to wake up'\n:\u751f\u307e\u308c\u308b ''umareru'' 'to be born'\n|}\n\nNote: Some intransitive verbs (usually verbs of motion) take what it looks like a direct object, but it is not.<ref>{{cite web|title=\u5bfe\u5fdc\u3059\u308b\u4ed6\u52d5\u8a5e\u306e\u3042\u308b\u81ea\u52d5\u8a5e\u306e\u610f\u5473\u7684\u30fb\u7d71\u5408\u7684\u7279\u5fb4 |url=http://repository.kulib.kyoto-u.ac.jp/dspace/bitstream/2433/8792/1/gen00006_079.pdf |publisher=Kyoto University |accessdate=May 18, 2013 }}{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> For example, ''hanareru'' (\u96e2\u308c\u308b, to leave):\n\n:\u79c1\u306f \u6771\u4eac\u3092 \u96e2\u308c\u308b\u3002\n:''Watashi wa T\u014dky\u014d o hanareru.''\n:I leave Tokyo.\n\n===Adjectival verbs and nouns===\n:{{Main|Japanese equivalents of adjectives}}\n\nSemantically speaking, words that denote attributes or properties are primarily distributed between two morphological classes (there are also a few other classes):\n*adjectival verbs (conventionally called \"''i''-adjectives\") (\u5f62\u5bb9\u8a5e ''keiy\u014dshi'')&nbsp;\u2013 these have roots and conjugating stem forms, and are semantically and morphologically similar to [[stative verb]]s.\n*adjectival nouns (conventionally called \"''na''-adjectives\") (\u5f62\u5bb9\u52d5\u8a5e ''keiy\u014dd\u014dshi'', lit. \"adjectival verb\")&nbsp;\u2013 these are nouns that combine with the copula.\n\nUnlike adjectives in languages like English, ''i''-adjectives in Japanese inflect for aspect and mood, like verbs. Japanese adjectives do not have comparative or superlative inflections; comparatives and superlatives have to be marked periphrastically using adverbs like ''motto'' 'more' and ''ichiban'' 'most'.\n\nEvery adjective in Japanese can be used in an [[Adjective#Attributive|attributive position]]. Nearly every Japanese adjective can be used in a [[Adjective#Predicative|predicative position]]; this differs from English where there are many common adjectives such as \"major\", as in \"a major question\", that cannot be used in the predicate position (that is, *\"The question is major\" is not grammatical English). There are a few Japanese adjectives that cannot predicate, known as \u9023\u4f53\u8a5e (''rentaishi,'' attributives), which are derived from other word classes; examples include \u5927\u304d\u306a  ''\u014dkina'' \"big\", \u5c0f\u3055\u306a  ''chiisana'' \"small\", and \u304a\u304b\u3057\u306a ''okashina'' \"strange\" which are all stylistic ''na''-type variants of normal ''i''-type adjectives.\n\nAll ''i''-adjectives except for \u3044\u3044  (''ii'', good) have regular conjugations, and ''ii'' is irregular only in the fact that it is a changed form of the regular adjective \u826f\u3044  ''yoi'' permissible in the terminal and attributive forms. For all other forms it reverts to ''yoi''.\n\n<div style=\"text-align: center\">\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ Stem forms for adjectives\n|-\n!rowspan=\"2\"|\n! ''i''-adjectives\n!

However, it was only in 1946 that the Japanese ministry of education modified existing [[kana]] usage to conform to the standard dialect (\u5171\u901a\u8a9e ''ky\u014dts\u016bgo''). All earlier texts used the archaic orthography, now referred to as [[historical kana usage]]. The adjoining table is a nearly exhaustive list of these spelling changes.\n\nNote that palatalized morae {{nihongo||\u3086\u3001\u3088|yu, yo}} combine with the initial consonant, if present, yielding a palatalized syllable. The most basic example of this is modern {{Nihongo||\u4eca\u65e5\u3001\u304d\u3087\u3046|ky\u014d|today}}, which historically developed as {{Nihongo||\u3051\u3075|kefu}} \u2192 {{Nihongo||\u304d\u3087\u3046|ky\u014d}}, via the {{Nihongo||\u3048\u3075|efu}} \u2192 {{Nihongo||\u3088\u3046|y\u014d}} rule.\n\nA few sound changes are not reflected in the spelling. Firstly, ''ou'' merged with ''oo,'' both being pronounced as a long ''\u014d.'' Secondly, the particles \u306f and \u3092 are still written using historical kana usage, though these are pronounced as ''wa'' and ''o,'' rather than ''ha'' and ''wo,'' with the rare exception of \u301c\u3093\u3092, which is pronounced as ''-n wo,'' as in {{Nihongo||\u5343\u5186\u3092\u3044\u305f\u3060\u304d\u307e\u3059|sen'en wo itadakimasu|I humbly receive one thousand yen}}.\n\nAmong Japanese speakers, it is not generally understood that the historical ''kana'' spellings were, at one point, reflective of pronunciation. For example, the modern ''on'yomi'' reading {{Nihongo||\u3088\u3046|y\u014d}} for {{Nihongo|leaf|\u8449|y\u014d}} arose from historical {{Nihongo||\u3048\u3075|efu}}. The latter was pronounced something like {{IPA|[\u02b2epu]}} by the Japanese at the time it was borrowed (compare [[Middle Chinese]] {{IPA|[ji\u025bp\u031a]}}). However, a modern reader of a classical text would still read this as {{IPAc-ja|y\u014d}}, the modern pronunciation.\n\n====Verb conjugations====\n:{{Main|Japanese verb conjugation}}\n\nAs mentioned above, conjugations of some verbs and adjectives differ from the prescribed formation rules because of euphonic changes. Nearly all of these euphonic changes are themselves regular. For verbs the exceptions are all in the ending of the continuative form of group when the following auxiliary starts with a ''t''-sound, ''i.e.'', \u305f  ''ta'', \u3066  ''te'', \u305f\u308a  ''tari'', etc.\n\n{{clear}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" <!-- cellspacing=\"0\" cellpadding=\"5\" border=\"1\" -->\n! continuative ending !! changes to !! example\n|-\n| \u3044 ''i'', \u3061 ''chi'' or \u308a ''ri''\n| \u3063 (double consonant)\n| *\u8cb7\u3044\u3066 ''*kaite'' \u2192 \u8cb7\u3063\u3066 ''katte''<br>*\u6253\u3061\u3066 ''*uchite'' \u2192 \u6253\u3063\u3066 ''utte''<br>*\u77e5\u308a\u3066 ''*shirite'' \u2192 \u77e5\u3063\u3066 ''shitte''\n|-\n| \u3073 ''bi'', \u307f''mi'' or \u306b ''ni''\n| \u3093 (syllabic ''n''), with the following \u30bf ''t'' sound voiced\n| *\u904a\u3073\u3066 ''*asobite'' \u2192 \u904a\u3093\u3067 ''asonde''<br>*\u4f4f\u307f\u3066 ''*sumite'' \u2192 \u4f4f\u3093\u3067 ''sunde''<br>*\u6b7b\u306b\u3066 ''*shinite'' \u2192 \u6b7b\u3093\u3067 ''shinde''\n|-\n| \u304d ''ki''\n| \u3044 ''i''\n| *\u66f8\u304d\u3066 ''*kakite'' \u2192 \u66f8\u3044\u3066 ''kaite''\n|-\n| \u304e ''gi''\n| \u3044 ''i'', with the following \u30bf ''t'' sound voiced\n| *\u6cf3\u304e\u3066 ''*oyogite'' \u2192 \u6cf3\u3044\u3067 ''oyoide''\n|}\n\n:<nowiki>*</nowiki> denotes impossible/ungrammatical form.\n\nThere is one other irregular change: \u884c\u304f ''iku'' (to go), for which there is an exceptional continuative form: \u884c\u304d ''iki'' + \u3066 ''te'' \u2192 \u884c\u3063\u3066 ''itte'', \u884c\u304d ''iki'' + \u305f ''ta'' \u2192 \u884c\u3063\u305f ''itta'', etc.\n\nThere are dialectical differences, which are also regular and generally occur in similar situations. For example, in [[Kansai dialect]] the ''-i'' + ''t-'' conjugations are instead changed to ''-ut-,'' as in {{Nihongo||\u601d\u3046\u305f|om\u014dta}} instead of {{Nihongo||\u601d\u3063\u305f|omotta}}, as perfective of {{Nihongo||\u601d\u3046|omou|think}}. In this example, this can combine with the preceding vowel via historical sound changes, as in {{Nihongo||\u3057\u3082\u3046\u305f|shim\u014dta}} (''au'' \u2192 ''\u014d'') instead of standard {{Nihongo||\u3057\u307e\u3063\u305f|shimatta}}.\n\n====Polite forms of adjectives====\nThe continuative form of proper adjectives, when followed by polite forms such as {{Nihongo||\u5fa1\u5ea7\u308b|\u3054\u3056\u308b|gozaru|be}} or {{Nihongo||\u5b58\u3058\u308b|zonjiru|know, think}}, undergoes a transformation; this may be followed by historical sound changes, yielding a one-step or two-step sound change. Note that these verbs are almost invariably conjugated to polite {{Nihongo||\u301c\u307e\u3059|-masu}} form, as {{Nihongo||\u3054\u3056\u3044\u307e\u3059|gozaimasu}} and {{Nihongo||\u5b58\u3058\u307e\u3059|zonjimasu}} (note the irregular conjugation of ''gozaru,'' discussed below), and that these verbs are preceded by the ''continuative'' form \u2013 {{Nihongo||\u301c\u304f|-ku}} \u2013 of adjectives, rather than the terminal form \u2013 {{Nihongo||\u301c\u3044|-i}} \u2013 which is used before the more everyday {{Nihongo||\u3067\u3059|desu|be}}.\n\nThe rule is {{Nihongo||\u301c\u304f|-ku}} \u2192 {{Nihongo||\u301c\u3046|-u}} (dropping the ''-k-''), possibly also combining with the previous syllable according to the spelling reform chart, which may also undergo palatalization in the case of {{Nihongo||\u3086\u3001\u3088|yu, yo}}.\n\nHistorically there were two classes of proper [[Old Japanese#Adjectives|Old Japanese adjectives]], {{Nihongo||\u301c\u304f|-ku}} and {{Nihongo||\u301c\u3057\u304f|-shiku}} (\"''-ku'' adjective\" means \"not preceded by ''shi''\"). This distinction collapsed during the evolution of [[Late Middle Japanese#Adjectives|Late Middle Japanese adjectives]], and both are now considered {{Nihongo||\u301c\u3044|-i}} adjectives. The sound change for ''-shii'' adjectives follows the same rule as for other ''-ii'' adjectives, notably that the preceding vowel also changes and the preceding mora undergoes palatalization, yielding {{Nihongo||\u301c\u3057\u304f|-shiku}} \u2192 {{Nihongo||\u301c\u3057\u3085\u3046|-sh\u016b}}, though historically this was considered a separate but parallel rule.\n\n{| class=wikitable <!-- cellspacing=0 cellpadding=5 border=1 -->\n!

Indeed, adverbs are not an independent class of words, but rather a role played by other words. For example, every adjective in the continuative form can be used as an adverb; thus, \u5f31\u3044  ''yowai'' 'weak' (adj) \u2192 \u5f31\u304f  ''yowaku'' 'weakly' (adv). The primary distinguishing characteristic of adverbs is that they cannot occur in a predicate position, just as it is in English. The following classification of adverbs is not intended to be authoritative or exhaustive.\n; Verbal adverbs: are verbs in the continuative form with the particle ''ni''. E.g. \u898b\u308b  ''miru'' 'to see' \u2192 \u898b\u306b  ''mi ni'' 'for the purpose of seeing', used for instance as: \u898b\u306b\u884c\u304f ''mi ni iku'', ''go to see (something)''.\n; Adjectival adverbs: are adjectives in the continuative form, as mentioned above. Example:  \u5f31\u3044  ''yowai'' 'weak' (adj) \u2192 \u5f31\u304f  ''yowaku'' 'weakly' (adv)\n; Nominal adverbs: are grammatical nouns that function as adverbs. Example: \u4e00\u756a  ''ichiban'' 'most highly'.\n; Sound symbolism: are words that mimic sounds or concepts. Examples: \u304d\u3089\u304d\u3089  ''kirakira'' 'sparklingly', \u307d\u3063\u304f\u308a  ''pokkuri'' 'suddenly', \u3059\u308b\u3059\u308b ''surusuru'' 'smoothly (sliding)', etc.\n\nOften, especially for sound symbolism, the particle ''to'' \"as if\" is used. See the article on [[Japanese sound symbolism]].\n\n===Conjunctions and interjections===\n\nExamples of conjunctions: \u305d\u3057\u3066  ''soshite'' 'and then', \u307e\u305f  ''mata'' 'and then/again', etc.\nAlthough called \"conjunctions\", these words are, as English translations show, actually a kind of adverb.\n\nExamples of interjections: \u306f\u3044 (''hai'', yes/OK/uh), \u3078\u3048 (''hee'', wow!), \u3044\u3044\u3048 (''iie'', no/no way), \u304a\u3044 (''oi'', hey!), etc.\nThis part of speech is not very different from that of English.\n\n==Ancillary words==\n\n===Particles===\n:{{Main|Japanese particles}}\n\nParticles in Japanese are postpositional, as they immediately follow the modified component. A full listing of particles is beyond the scope of this article, so only a few prominent particles are listed here. Keep in mind that the pronunciation and spelling differ for the particles ''wa'' (\u306f), ''e''  (\u3078) and ''o'' (\u3092): This article follows the [[Hepburn romanization|Hepburn-style]] of romanizing them according to the ''pronunciation'' rather than spelling.\n\n====Topic, theme, and subject: \u306f ''wa'' and \u304c ''ga''====\nThe complex distinction between the so-called topic (\u306f ''wa'') and subject (\u304c ''ga'') particles has been the theme of many doctoral dissertations and scholarly disputes. The clause \u8c61\u306f\u9f3b\u304c\u9577\u3044 ''z\u014d-wa hana-ga nagai'' is well known for appearing to contain two subjects. It does not simply mean \"the elephant's nose is long\", as that can be translated as \u8c61\u306e\u9f3b\u306f\u9577\u3044 ''z\u014d-no hana-wa nagai''. Rather, a more literal translation would be \"(speaking of) the elephant, its nose is long\".\n\nTwo major scholarly surveys of Japanese linguistics in English, (Shibatani 1990) and (Kuno 1973), clarify the distinction. To simplify matters, the referents of ''wa'' and ''ga'' in this section are called the ''topic'' and ''subject'' respectively, with the understanding that if either is absent, the grammatical topic and subject may coincide.\n\nAs an abstract and rough approximation, the difference between ''wa'' and ''ga'' is a matter of focus: ''wa'' gives focus to the ''action'' of the sentence, i.e., to the verb or adjective, whereas ''ga'' gives focus to the ''subject'' of the action. However, a more useful description must proceed by enumerating uses of these particles.\n\nHowever, when first being introduced to the topic and subject markers ''wa'' and ''ga'' most are told that the difference between the two is simpler. The topic marker, ''wa'', is used to declare or to make a statement. The subject marker, ''ga'', is used for new information, or asking for new information.\n\n''See [[Topic marker#Japanese: \u306f|Topic marker: Japanese: \u306f]].\n\n=====Thematic ''wa''=====\nThe use of ''wa'' to introduce a new theme of discourse is directly linked to the notion of grammatical theme. Opinions differ on the structure of discourse theme, though it seems fairly uncontroversial to imagine a first-in-first-out hierarchy of themes that is threaded through the discourse. Of course, human limitations restrict the scope and depth of themes, and later themes may cause earlier themes to expire. In these sorts of sentences, the steadfast translation into English uses constructs like \"''speaking of X''\" or \"''on the topic of X''\", though such translations tend to be bulky as they fail to use the thematic mechanisms of English. For lack of a comprehensive strategy, many teachers of Japanese emphasize the \"''speaking of X''\" pattern without sufficient warning.\n:\u30b8\u30e7\u30f3\u306f\u5b66\u751f\u3067\u3059\u3002\n:''JON wa gakusei desu''\n: (On the topic of) John, (he) is a student.\n\nA common linguistic joke shows the insufficiency of rote translation with the sentence \u50d5\u306f\u30a6\u30ca\u30ae\u3060 ''boku wa unagi da'', which per the pattern would translate as \"''I am an eel.''\" (or \"(As of) me is eel\"). Yet, in a restaurant this sentence can reasonably be used to say \"My order is eel\" (or \"I would like to order an eel\"), with no intended humour. This is because the sentence should be literally read, \"As for me, it is an eel,\" with \"it\" referring to the speaker's order. The topic of the sentence is clearly not its subject.\n\n=====Contrastive ''wa''=====\nRelated to the role of ''wa'' in introducing themes is its use in contrasting the current topic and its aspects from other possible topics and their aspects. The suggestive pattern is \"''X, but...''\" or \"''as for X, ...''\".\n:{{lang|ja|\u96e8\u306f\u964d\u3063\u3066\u3044\u307e\u3059\u304c...}}\n:''ame wa futte imasu ga...''\n:The rain is falling, but...\n\nBecause of its contrastive nature, the topic cannot be undefined.\n: *\u8ab0\u304b\u306f\u672c\u3092\u8aad\u3093\u3067\u3044\u308b\u3002\n: *''dareka wa hon o yonde iru''\n: *Someone is reading the book.\n\nIn this use, ''ga'' is required.\n\nIn practice, the distinction between thematic and contrastive ''wa'' is not that useful. Suffice it to say that there can be at most one thematic ''wa'' in a sentence, and it has to be the first ''wa'' if one exists, and the remaining ''wa''s are contrastive. For completeness, the following sentence (due to Kuno) illustrates the difference.\n:\u50d5\u304c\u77e5\u3063\u3066\u3044\u308b\u4eba\u306f\u8ab0\u3082\u6765\u306a\u304b\u3063\u305f\u3002\n:''boku ga shitte iru hito wa daremo konakatta''\n:(1) Of all the people I know, none came.\n:(2) (People came but), there weren't any of the people I know.\n\nThe first interpretation is the thematic ''wa'', treating \"the people I know\" (''boku ga shitte iru hito'') as the theme of the predicate \"none came\" (''dare mo konakatta''). That is, if I know A, B, ..., Z, then none of the people who came were A, B, ..., Z. The second interpretation is the contrastive ''wa''. If the likely attendees were A, B, ..., Z, and of them I know P, Q and R, then the sentence says that P, Q and R did not come. The sentence says ''nothing'' about A', B', ..., Z', all of whom I know, but none of whom were likely to come. (In practice the first interpretation is the likely one.)\n\n=====Exhaustive ''ga''=====\nUnlike ''wa'', the subject particle ''ga'' nominates its referent as the sole satisfier of the predicate. This distinction is famously illustrated by the following pair of sentences.\n:\u30b8\u30e7\u30f3\u3055\u3093\u306f\u5b66\u751f\u3067\u3059\u3002\n:''Jon-san wa gakusei desu''\n:John is a student.

In modern Japanese there are two distinct classes of auxiliary verbs:\n; Pure auxiliaries (\u52a9\u52d5\u8a5e ''jod\u014dshi'') : are usually just called ''verb endings'' or ''conjugated forms''. These auxiliaries do not function as independent verbs.\n; Helper auxiliaries (\u88dc\u52a9\u52d5\u8a5e ''hojod\u014dshi'') : are normal verbs that lose their independent meaning when used as auxiliaries.\n\nIn classical Japanese, which was more heavily agglutinating than modern Japanese, the category of ''auxiliary verb'' included every verbal ending after the stem form, and most of these endings were themselves inflected. In modern Japanese, however, some of them have stopped being productive. The prime example is the classical auxiliary \u305f\u308a ''-tari'', whose modern forms \u305f ''-ta'' and \u3066 ''-te'' are no longer viewed as inflections of the same suffix, and can take no further affixes.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center\"\n|+ '''Some pure auxiliary verbs'''\n! auxiliary !! group !! attaches to !! meaning modification !! example\n|-\n| \u307e\u3059  ''masu'' || irregular<sup>1</sup> || continuative || makes the sentence polite\n| \u66f8\u304f  ''kaku'' 'to write' \u2192 \u66f8\u304d\u307e\u3059  ''kakimasu''\n|-\n| \u3089\u308c\u308b  ''rareru''<sup>2</sup>\n|rowspan=\"3\"| 2b\n| irrealis of grp.&nbsp;2\n| makes V passive/honorific/potential\n| \u898b\u308b  ''miru'' 'to see' \u2192 \u898b\u3089\u308c\u308b  ''mirareru'' 'to be able to see'<br />\u98df\u3079\u308b ''taberu'' 'to eat' \u2192 \u98df\u3079\u3089\u308c\u308b  ''taberareru'' 'to be able to eat'\n|-\n| \u308c\u308b  ''reru'' || irrealis of grp.&nbsp;1\n| makes V passive/honorific\n| \u98f2\u3080  ''nomu'' 'to drink/swallow' \u2192 \u98f2\u307e\u308c\u308b  ''nomareru'' 'to be drunk' (Passive form of ''drink'', not a synonym for ''intoxicated''.)\n|-\n| \u308b  ''ru''<sup>3</sup> || hyp. of grp.&nbsp;1\n| makes V potential\n| \u98f2\u3080  ''nomu'' 'to drink/swallow' \u2192 \u98f2\u3081\u308b  ''nomeru'' 'to be able to drink'\n|-\n| \u3055\u305b\u308b  ''saseru''<sup>4</sup>\n|rowspan=\"2\"| 2b\n| irrealis of grp.&nbsp;2\n|rowspan=\"2\"| makes V causative\n| \u8003\u3048\u308b  ''kangaeru'' 'to think' \u2192 \u8003\u3048\u3055\u305b\u308b  ''kangaesaseru'' 'to cause to think'\n|-\n| \u305b\u308b  ''seru'' || irrealis of grp.&nbsp;1\n| \u601d\u3044\u77e5\u308b  ''omoishiru'' 'to realize' \u2192 \u601d\u3044\u77e5\u3089\u305b\u308b  ''omoishiraseru'' 'to cause to realize/to teach a lesson'\n|}\n:<sup>1</sup> \u307e\u3059  ''masu'' has stem forms: irrealis \u307e\u305b and \u307e\u3057\u3087, continuative \u307e\u3057, terminal \u307e\u3059, attributive \u307e\u3059, hypothetical \u307e\u3059\u308c, imperative \u307e\u305b.\n:<sup>2</sup> \u3089\u308c\u308b  ''rareru'' in potential usage is sometimes shortened to \u308c\u308b  ''reru'' (grp.&nbsp;2); thus \u98df\u3079\u308c\u308b  ''tabereru'' 'to be able to eat' instead of \u98df\u3079\u3089\u308c\u308b  ''taberareru''. But it is considered non-standard.\n:<sup>3</sup> Technically, such an auxiliary verb \u308b, ''ru'', denoting the potential form, does not exist, as for example \u98f2\u3081\u308b  ''nomeru'' is thought to actually come from the contraction of \u98f2\u307f\u5f97\u308b, ''nomieru'' (see below). However, textbooks tend to teach it this way. (\u98f2\u3081\u308b in old texts would have been the attributive past tense form of \u98f2\u3080 instead of the potential meaning.)\n:<sup>4</sup> \u3055\u305b\u308b  ''saseru'' is sometimes shortened to \u3055\u3059  ''sasu'' (grp.&nbsp;1), but this usage is somewhat literary.\n\nMuch of the agglutinative flavour of Japanese stems from helper auxiliaries, however.

However, the contestants do not meet face-to-face during the course of the competition, as they each live in their own individual apartment. They communicate solely using their profiles on a specially-designed [[social media]] app that gives them the ability to portray themselves in any way they choose. Players can thus opt to present themselves as a completely different personality to the other players, a tactic otherwise known as [[catfishing]]; for example, one male player in the first season presented himself as a female identity, while another female contestant used photos of a woman she felt was more attractive.<ref name=\"polygon\">{{cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/entertainment/2020/1/10/21058661/the-circle-review-netflix-new-reality-show-catfishing|title=Netflix's The Circle is the sweetest reality show about catfishing|first=Ben|last=Kuchera|language=en-us|date=10 January 2020|accessdate=10 January 2020|work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]}}</ref>\n\nThroughout the series, the contestants \"rate\" one another from first to last place. At the end of the ratings, their average ratings are revealed to one another from lowest to highest. Normally, the two highest-rated players become \"influencers\", while the remaining players will be at risk of being \"blocked\" by the influencers. However, occasionally there may be a twist to the blocking process \u2013 varying from the lowest rating players being instantly blocked, the identity of the influencers being a secret, or multiple players being blocked at one time. Blocked players are eliminated from the game, but are given the opportunity to meet one player still in the game in-person. Then, the day after a blocking, a video message is shown to the remaining players to reveal if they were real or fake.<ref name=\"polygon\"/>\n\nDuring the finale, the contestants rate each other one final time, where the highest rated player wins the game and [[Euro|\u20ac]]100,000 ({{USD|110000}}).<ref name=\"trailer\"/>\n\n== Players ==\nThe players were selected from the \"20\u201325 individuals\" being cleared to appear on the show, with the remaining people never leaving standby status and not appearing on the show.<ref name=\"variety interview 1\">{{cite web |last1=Turchiano |first1=Danielle |title='The Circle' Boss on Connecting 'People Who Otherwise Might Not Have Come into Contact with Each Other' \u2014 And Catfishing |url=https://variety.com/2020/tv/features/the-circle-netflix-american-tim-harcourt-catfish-interview-1203449625/ |website=variety.com |publisher=Variety |accessdate=2 January 2020 |date=1 January 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref> The first nine players were revealed on ''The Circle France''{{'}}s [[Instagram]] profile.<ref>{{cite web |author1=@circlegame |title=Qui d'autre ne peut pas attendre! \ud83d\ude4c regardez les joueurs entrer dans The Circle Tomorrow sur @NetflixFR |url=https://www.instagram.com/p/B-tq9EsAU9X/ |website=instagram.com |publisher=Instagram |accessdate=8 April 2020 |date=8 April 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref> The players' profiles were revealed as they introduced themselves on-screen during an episode.<ref name=\"insider\"/><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.craveyoutv.com/exclusive-interview-whats-next-for-best-friend-bill-from-the-circle/|title=Exclusive Interview: What's Next for Best Friend Bill from 'The Circle'|last=Buczak|first=Lizzy|date=2020-02-25|website=CraveyouTV TV Show Recaps, TV Reviews, Spoilers, Interviews|language=en-US|access-date=2020-02-27}}</ref>\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"text-align:center;\"\n!

Brandon Reigg, Netflix's Vice Principal of Unscripted Content, stated, \"We think the show's combination of modern social media interaction and competition will captivate Netflix members around the world, in multiple languages, and we're delighted to partner with Studio Lambert and Motion to produce these three new local versions.\"<ref name=\"adaptation\">{{cite web|url=https://media.netflix.com/en/press-releases/netflix-to-adapt-uk-unscripted-sensation-the-circle-with-three-local-versions-for-countries-around-the-world|title=Netflix to Adapt UK Unscripted Sensation ''The Circle'' with Three Local Versions for Countries Around the World|date=8 October 2018|publisher=Netflix Media Center|location=Hollywood, California|url-status=live|accessdate=11 January 2020}}</ref>\n\n== Production == \n=== Casting ===\nIn an interview with ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'', Tim Harcourt, one of the executive producers for [[Studio Lambert]], stated that ''The Circle'' format and premise allowed the casting team to search for all different kinds of people. He noted how the casting contrasted from casts on show like ''[[Real Housewives]]'' or ''[[Jersey Shore (TV series)|Jersey Shore]]'' and how those shows are \"all one gang of quite similar characters.\"<ref name=\"variety interview\">{{cite web |last1=Turchiano |first1=Danielle |title='The Circle' Boss on Connecting 'People Who Otherwise Might Not Have Come into Contact with Each Other' \u2014 And Catfishing |url=https://variety.com/2020/tv/features/the-circle-netflix-american-tim-harcourt-catfish-interview-1203449625/ |website=variety.com |publisher=Variety |accessdate=2 January 2020 |date=1 January 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref> He explained how there was no set cast for the show until it was over. The first eight players to enter were all predetermined and planned, but everything after that was all luck to whoever got on. Harcourt stated that the production team would decide who would be the right fit depending on who just left the game, acknowledging that with thirteen contestants, not all who were possible players end up on the show at all.<ref name=\"variety interview\"/>\n\nJennifer Teixido was the casting director for ''The Circle France''.<ref>{{cite web |title=Jennifer TEIXIDO |url=https://fr.linkedin.com/in/jenn-teixido |publisher=Linkedin |accessdate=8 April 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Jenn Teixido \ud83c\udfac Directrice des castings @tf1 .

Each player starts out the game by creating a profile. This includes sharing their age, [[relationship status]], a short [[biography|bio]], and one photo to use as their [[Avatar (computing)|profile picture]]. Everyday, the players are allowed to share a status update, explaining their thoughts for the day. Sometimes, either through rewards or passing a certain milestone, the players are allowed to upload another photo to their profile.<ref name=\"variety interview\"/> However, the main purpose of The Circle (\"du Cercle\" in [[French language|French]]) is to be the only way players can communicate with each other.<ref name=\"variety interview\"/>\n\nAt several points during the game, usually every episode, The Circle has the players play a [[minigame]] so that they can get to know their fellow players better. Tim Harcourt of [[Studio Lambert]] says that \"some games were really good for bonding them, some were really good for them learning about each other, some were good for testing who's a catfish, some could have been more divisive.\"<ref name=\"variety interview\"/>\n\nAt certain points during the show, there would be a rating. Players would have to rate each other from first to last by using The Circle and announcing the players they want in each placement. Then, the ratings would be averaged and create an average placement for each player. Depending on how high or low their average placement was, the player's ranking would determine if they became in influencer or not. An influencer is usually the two people who get first and second place at the ratings. The influencers would head to the hangout and discuss over The Circle which person to block.<ref name=\"variety interview\"/><ref>{{cite web |last1=Fallo |first1=Julie |title=The Circle: US Version Has a Shot at Succeeding From All the Right Changes |url=https://screenrant.com/circle-us-version-success-changes/ |website=screenrant.com |publisher=Screen Rant |accessdate=15 January 2020 |date=3 January 2020 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n=== Filming ===\n''The Circle France'' was filmed in December 2019, in the same [[Salford|Salford, England]] apartment building that was also used by [[The Circle (American TV series)|American version]]'s [[The Circle (American season 1)|first season]], the [[The Circle (British TV series)|British version]]'s [[The Circle (British series 2)|second season]], and the [[The Circle (Brazilian TV series)|Brazilian version's first season]].

Since C\u00e9dric received more votes, he was blocked.\n*{{note|2|Note 2}}: In Episode 9, the ratings were not published.

However, the contestants do not meet face-to-face during the course of the competition, as they each live in their own individual apartment. They communicate solely using their profiles on a specially-designed [[social media]] app that gives them the ability to portray themselves in any way they choose. Players can thus opt to present themselves as a completely different personality to the other players, a tactic otherwise known as [[catfishing]]; for example, one male player in the first season presented himself as a female identity, while another female contestant used photos of a woman she felt was more attractive.<ref name=\"polygon\">{{cite web|url=https://www.polygon.com/entertainment/2020/1/10/21058661/the-circle-review-netflix-new-reality-show-catfishing|title=Netflix's The Circle is the sweetest reality show about catfishing|first=Ben|last=Kuchera|language=en-us|date=10 January 2020|accessdate=10 January 2020|work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]}}</ref>\n\nThroughout the series, the contestants \"rate\" one another from first to last place. At the end of the ratings, their average ratings are revealed to one another from lowest to highest. Normally, the two highest-rated players become \"influencers\", while the remaining players will be at risk of being \"blocked\" by the influencers. However, occasionally there may be a twist to the blocking process \u2013 varying from the lowest rating players being instantly blocked, the identity of the influencers being a secret, or multiple players being blocked at one time. Blocked players are eliminated from the game, but are given the opportunity to meet one player still in the game in-person.

Each player starts out the game by creating a profile. This includes sharing their age, [[relationship status]], a short [[biography|bio]], and one photo to use as their [[Avatar (computing)|profile picture]]. Everyday, the players are allowed to share a status update, explaining their thoughts for the day. Sometimes, either through rewards or passing a certain milestone, the players are allowed to upload another photo to their profile.<ref name=\"variety interview\"/> However, the main purpose of The Circle (\"du Cercle\" in [[French language|French]]) is to be the only way players can communicate with each other.<ref name=\"variety interview\"/>\n\nAt several points during the game, usually every episode, The Circle has the players play a [[minigame]] so that they can get to know their fellow players better. Tim Harcourt of [[Studio Lambert]] says that \"some games were really good for bonding them, some were really good for them learning about each other, some were good for testing who's a catfish, some could have been more divisive.\"<ref name=\"variety interview\"/>\n\nAt certain points during the show, there would be a rating. Players would have to rate each other from first to last by using The Circle and announcing the players they want in each placement. Then, the ratings would be averaged and create an average placement for each player. Depending on how high or low their average placement was, the player's ranking would determine if they became in influencer or not. An influencer is usually the two people who get first and second place at the ratings.

He has authored a number of novels and books of non-fiction, which have won literary awards and been translated into 24 languages. [[Kathryn Schulz]], writing in ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'', described him as \"one of our greatest living critics, not of the arts but of life itself, and one of our most original writers\".<ref>[https://www.vulture.com/2014/05/book-review-another-great-day-at-sea.html New York Magazine]</ref>\n\n==Personal background==\nDyer was born and raised in [[Cheltenham]], England, as the only child of a [[sheet metal]] worker father and a [[Lunch lady|school dinner lady]] mother. He was educated at the local grammar school and won a scholarship to study English at [[Corpus Christi College, Oxford]]. He is married to [[Rebecca Wilson (curator)|Rebecca Wilson]], chief curator at [[Saatchi Art]], Los Angeles.<ref>He currently lives in Venice, California. {{cite news | author=Geoff Dyer | title=I am What I am: Geoff Dyer | date=29 March 2009 | work=[[The Sunday Times]] | url=http://women.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/women/the_way_we_live/article5966843.ece | accessdate=2011-05-09 | location=London}}</ref> In March 2014, Dyer said he had had a minor stroke earlier in the year, shortly after moving to live in [[Venice, Los Angeles]].<ref>Dyer, Geoff [http://www.lrb.co.uk/v36/n07/geoff-dyer/diary ''Diary''] [[London Review of Books]], Vol. 36 No. 7 \u2013 3 April 2014.</ref>\n\n==Writing career==\nDyer is the author of four novels: ''The Colour of Memory;'' ''The Search;'' ''Paris Trance;'' and, most recently, ''Jeff in Venice, Death in Varanasi''. He wrote a critical study of John Berger \u2013 ''Ways of Telling \u2013'' and two collections of essays: ''Anglo-English Attitudes'' and ''Working the Room''.  A selection of essays from these collections entitled ''Otherwise Known as the Human Condition'' was published in the U.S. in April 2011 and won the [[National Book Critics Circle Award]] for Criticism.\n\nDyer wrote seven genre-defying titles: ''But Beautiful'' (on jazz); ''The Missing of the Somme'' (on the memorialization of the First World War); ''Out of Sheer Rage'' (about [[D. H. Lawrence]]); ''Yoga For People Who Can\u2019t Be Bothered To Do It;'' ''The Ongoing Moment'' (on photography); ''Zona'' (about [[Andrei Tarkovsky]]\u2019s 1979 film ''[[Stalker (1979 film)|Stalker]]''); and ''Broadsword Calling Danny Boy'' (about [[Brian G. Hutton]]'s 1968 film ''[[Where Eagles Dare]]''). He is the editor of ''John Berger: Selected Essays'' and co-editor, with Margaret Sartor, of ''What Was True: The Photographs and Notebooks of William Gedney''.\n\nOne of his most recent books, ''Another Great Day at Sea'' (2014), chronicles Dyer\u2019s experiences on the [[USS George H.W. Bush (CVN-77)|USS George H.W. Bush]], where he was writer-in-residence for two weeks. It has been described by [[David Finkel]], author of ''Thank You for Your Service'', as \"what we\u2019ve all come to expect from Geoff Dyer\u2014another great book. I loved everything about it. It\u2019s brilliantly observed, beautifully written, incisive, funny, and filled with stirring truths about life and the value of service.\" [[Billy Collins]], the former [[United States Poet Laureate]] and author of ''Aimless Love'', said: \"Geoff Dyer has managed to do again what he does best: insert himself into an exotic and demanding environment (sometimes, his own flat, but here, the violent wonders of an aircraft carrier) and file a report that mixes empathetic appreciation with dips into brilliant comic deflation. Welcome aboard the edifying and sometimes hilarious ship Dyer.\"\n\nDyer was made a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Literature]] in 2005.<ref>[http://www.rslit.org/people Royal Society of Literature: Current RSL Fellows (Accessdate 03-06-13)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121002061545/http://www.rslit.org/people |date=2 October 2012 }}</ref> In 2014 he was elected as an Honorary Fellow of Corpus Christi College, Oxford.\n\nIn 2013 he served as the Bedell Distinguished Visiting Professor<ref>https://now.uiowa.edu/keywords/geoff-dyer</ref> at the [[University of Iowa]]'s Nonfiction Writing Program.

He has authored a number of novels and books of non-fiction, which have won literary awards and been translated into 24 languages. [[Kathryn Schulz]], writing in ''[[New York (magazine)|New York]]'', described him as \"one of our greatest living critics, not of the arts but of life itself, and one of our most original writers\".<ref>[https://www.vulture.com/2014/05/book-review-another-great-day-at-sea.html New York Magazine]</ref>\n\n==Personal background==\nDyer was born and raised in [[Cheltenham]], England, as the only child of a [[sheet metal]] worker father and a [[Lunch lady|school dinner lady]] mother. He was educated at the local grammar school and won a scholarship to study English at [[Corpus Christi College, Oxford]]. He is married to [[Rebecca Wilson (curator)|Rebecca Wilson]], chief curator at [[Saatchi Art]], Los Angeles.<ref>He currently lives in Venice, California. {{cite news | author=Geoff Dyer | title=I am What I am: Geoff Dyer | date=29 March 2009 | work=[[The Sunday Times]] | url=http://women.timesonline.co.uk/tol/life_and_style/women/the_way_we_live/article5966843.ece | accessdate=2011-05-09 | location=London}}</ref> In March 2014, Dyer said he had had a minor stroke earlier in the year, shortly after moving to live in [[Venice, Los Angeles]].<ref>Dyer, Geoff [http://www.lrb.co.uk/v36/n07/geoff-dyer/diary ''Diary''] [[London Review of Books]], Vol. 36 No. 7 \u2013 3 April 2014.</ref>\n\n==Writing career==\nDyer is the author of four novels: ''The Colour of Memory;'' ''The Search;'' ''Paris Trance;'' and, most recently, ''Jeff in Venice, Death in Varanasi''. He wrote a critical study of John Berger \u2013 ''Ways of Telling \u2013 and'' two collections of essays: ''Anglo-English Attitudes'' and ''Working the Room''.  A selection of essays from these collections entitled ''Otherwise Known as the Human Condition'' was published in the U.S. in April 2011 and won the [[National Book Critics Circle Award]] for Criticism.\n\nDyer wrote seven genre-defying titles: ''But Beautiful'' (on jazz); ''The Missing of the Somme'' (on the memorialization of the First World War); ''Out of Sheer Rage'' (about [[D. H. Lawrence]]); ''Yoga For People Who Can\u2019t Be Bothered To Do It;'' ''The Ongoing Moment'' (on photography); ''Zona'' (about [[Andrei Tarkovsky]]\u2019s 1979 film ''[[Stalker (1979 film)|Stalker]]''); and ''Broadsword Calling Danny Boy'' (about [[Brian G. Hutton]]'s 1968 film ''[[Where Eagles Dare]]''). He is the editor of ''John Berger: Selected Essays'' and co-editor, with Margaret Sartor, of ''What Was True: The Photographs and Notebooks of William Gedney''.\n\nOne of his most recent books, ''Another Great Day at Sea'' (2014), chronicles Dyer\u2019s experiences on the [[USS George H.W. Bush (CVN-77)|USS George H.W. Bush]], where he was writer-in-residence for two weeks. It has been described by [[David Finkel]], author of ''Thank You for Your Service'', as \"what we\u2019ve all come to expect from Geoff Dyer\u2014another great book. I loved everything about it. It\u2019s brilliantly observed, beautifully written, incisive, funny, and filled with stirring truths about life and the value of service.\" [[Billy Collins]], the former [[United States Poet Laureate]] and author of ''Aimless Love'', said: \"Geoff Dyer has managed to do again what he does best: insert himself into an exotic and demanding environment (sometimes, his own flat, but here, the violent wonders of an aircraft carrier) and file a report that mixes empathetic appreciation with dips into brilliant comic deflation.

It is named for the nearby [[Bronx River]], which it parallels. The southern terminus of the parkway is at Story Avenue near the [[Bruckner Expressway]] in [[the Bronx]] neighborhood of [[Soundview, Bronx|Soundview]]. The northern terminus is at the Kensico Circle in [[Valhalla, New York|Valhalla]], [[Mount Pleasant, New York|Mount Pleasant]], [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]], where the parkway connects to the [[Taconic State Parkway]] and, via a short connector, [[New York State Route&nbsp;22]] (NY&nbsp;22). Within the Bronx, the parkway is maintained by the [[New York State Department of Transportation]] and is designated '''New York State Route&nbsp;907H''' ('''NY&nbsp;907H'''), an unsigned [[reference route (New York)|reference route]]. In Westchester County, the parkway is maintained by the Westchester County Department of Public Works and is designated unsigned '''County Route&nbsp;9987''' ('''CR&nbsp;9987''').\n\nMost of the exits on the parkway, including the traffic light-controlled intersections in Westchester County, have interchange numbers. The term \"Bronx River Parkway\" originally referred to the Bronx River Reservation, New York's first [[linear park]], of which the road is a portion, from the Bronx\u2013Westchester county line to [[Kensico Dam]] Plaza.  Current usage of the term is confined to the roadway, but extends it to the portion which now continues southward beyond the Reservation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://parks.westchestergov.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=1900&Itemid=4466 |title=Bronx River Parkway Reservation |publisher=Westchester County Department of Parks |year=2008 |accessdate=November 6, 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Route description==\nThe southern third of the parkway, in the Bronx, is exclusively limited-access. It serves as a commuter route, intersecting several major east\u2013west routes. Halfway through the borough it begins to closely parallel the [[Harlem Line]] of [[Metro-North Railroad]], a pairing which continues to the road's northern terminus.\n\nIn Westchester County, the road continues to have the same character until the [[Sprain Brook Parkway]] splits off at [[Bronxville, New York|Bronxville]], allowing most through traffic to bypass [[White Plains, New York|White Plains]]. The stretches north of that junction have more of the original park character, and are still used that way. North of White Plains the exits are at-grade intersections with traffic lights.\n\n===The Bronx===\nThe parkway begins at Story Avenue in the [[Bronx]] neighborhood of [[Soundview, Bronx|Soundview]], where two roadways merge near Metcalf and Morrison Avenues. Immediately to the north is the [[cloverleaf interchange]] at the [[Bruckner Expressway]] ([[Interstate&nbsp;278]] or I-278), where most traffic enters the parkway.<ref name=\"exit list southern half of parkway\">{{cite web|title=Bronx River Parkway Exit List (Sound View to Bronxville)|url=http://www.nycroads.com/exits/bronx-river_bronx/|website=nycroads.com|publisher=Eastern Roads, Inc.|accessdate=24 September 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141101064919/http://www.nycroads.com/exits/bronx-river_bronx/|archivedate=1 November 2014}}</ref> Basketball courts and baseball fields flank the highway in the strip of parkland as the road leads to the north, slightly northwestward.

Vehicles continuing are now on the [[Sprain Brook Parkway]], for which this is the southern terminus; traffic for the BRP must exit. The exit numbers reset; the new exit&nbsp;1, Paxton Avenue in Bronxville, is on the northbound lanes just north of the split (exit&nbsp;1A allows southbound traffic to leave the parkway for Desmond Avenue just before merging). Exit&nbsp;2, West Pondfield Road, also northbound-only, is a thousand feet (300 m) to the north as the highway curves around downtown Bronxville to the east. Here, the road runs through the [[Armour Villa, Yonkers|Armour Villa neighborhood]] until it runs under the Tuckahoe Road bridge. Almost a mile (1.6&nbsp;km) separates it from the next exit, at Elm Street in [[Tuckahoe, Westchester County, New York|Tuckahoe]]. The park continues to parallel the parkway, with paved [[bike path]]s and a large pond. A thousand feet to the north, Scarsdale Road is the first at-grade interchange, and the parkway then turns sharply to the east, then back to the northeast more gradually. Exit&nbsp;8, Thompson Street, serves the nearby [[Crestwood (Metro-North station)|Crestwood]] station as the Harlem Line's tracks begin to parallel the road again. Another three-quarter mile north, after the road has resumed its northeast course, comes the next at-grade exit, Leewood Drive, on the northbound side.\n\nA quarter-mile (500 m) to the north are abandoned parking lots on both sides that were once gas stations. One-tenth of a mile (150 m) to the north, the roadways diverge and the river runs between them. Just beyond this is another at-grade interchange, Strathmore and Harney roads. The roadways remain apart through a wooded section as they curve westward for the next three-quarter mile, returning to the highway's northeastern heading as it leaves Yonkers and briefly enters [[Greenburgh, New York|Greenburgh]] south of the southbound Ardsley Road exit east of downtown [[Scarsdale, New York|Scarsdale]]. Just after it curves eastward again and crosses the Harlem Line, entering Scarsdale, traffic can enter and exit at Crane Road and East Parkway with southbound traffic using a light to cross over the northbound lanes and no entrance onto the southbound lanes. In the next {{convert|2.2|mi|adj=on}} stretch, there are exits for Ogden and Butler roads from the northbound lanes. Fenimore Road, just east of the [[Hartsdale, New York|Hartsdale]] and its [[Hartsdale (Metro-North station)|train station]], is a northbound exit with southbound entry. Just to its north, southbound traffic can exit onto Greenacres Avenue. The parkway begins heading even more to the northeast, the tracks immediately adjacent, past northbound exits for River and Claremont roads.\n\nJust north of the latter exit, the highway enters [[White Plains, New York|White Plains]], the Westchester [[county seat]]. After the northbound Walworth crossing exit, it turns northwest across the river and the tracks and then resumes its northeasterly course. A half-mile (1&nbsp;km) north it reaches the Main Street ([[New York State Route 119|NY&nbsp;119]]) northbound exit/southbound entrance, just west of the [[White Plains (Metro-North station)|White Plains]] station on the west side of heavily developed downtown White Plains. It bends north and then northwest to the first of several at-grade intersections with traffic lights, also signed and numbered as exits, with Central Avenue ([[New York State Route 100|NY&nbsp;100]]), at the [[Westchester County Center]]. From here parkway traffic is also directed toward the nearby Cross-Westchester Expressway ([[Interstate 287|I-287]]) via NY&nbsp;119, as the parkway has no direct interchange with it.\n\nThe two roadways once again diverge, becoming almost {{convert|400|ft}} apart in the half-mile (1&nbsp;km) before they converge again as they reach the Old Tarrytown Road intersection just north of the expressway. Beyond it the parkway goes due north before curving slightly into the Fisher Lane intersection just west of the last Metro-North station along the parkway, [[North White Plains (Metro-North station)|North White Plains]]. The Maryton and Virginia Road intersections follow, spaced roughly a thousand feet (300 m) apart. Another thousand feet from that intersection, the highway turns to the northeast again as the roadways diverge and cross the Harlem Line and the Bronx River for the last time. Northbound traffic has the last exit, exit&nbsp;27, onto Washington Avenue. [[Kensico Dam]] is visible in the distance as the parkway reaches its northern terminus at Kensico Circle, southern terminus of the [[Taconic State Parkway]], also listed on the Register.\n\nA seven-mile (11&nbsp;km) section of the Bronx River Parkway in Westchester County south of White Plains is closed to motorist traffic from 10 AM to 2 PM select Sundays in May, June and September (with the exception of Memorial and Labor Day weekends), allowing [[bicycle|bicyclists]] to venture along the scenic road.

County, New York|Westchester]]\n}}\nThe '''Bronx River Parkway''' (sometimes abbreviated as the '''Bronx Parkway''') is a {{convert|19.12|mi|km|2|adj=on}} long [[parkway]] in [[downstate New York]] in the United States. It is named for the nearby [[Bronx River]], which it parallels. The southern terminus of the parkway is at Story Avenue near the [[Bruckner Expressway]] in [[the Bronx]] neighborhood of [[Soundview, Bronx|Soundview]]. The northern terminus is at the Kensico Circle in [[Valhalla, New York|Valhalla]], [[Mount Pleasant, New York|Mount Pleasant]], [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]], where the parkway connects to the [[Taconic State Parkway]] and, via a short connector, [[New York State Route&nbsp;22]] (NY&nbsp;22). Within the Bronx, the parkway is maintained by the [[New York State Department of Transportation]] and is designated '''New York State Route&nbsp;907H''' ('''NY&nbsp;907H'''), an unsigned [[reference route (New York)|reference route]]. In Westchester County, the parkway is maintained by the Westchester County Department of Public Works and is designated unsigned '''County Route&nbsp;9987''' ('''CR&nbsp;9987''').\n\nMost of the exits on the parkway, including the traffic light-controlled intersections in Westchester County, have interchange numbers. The term \"Bronx River Parkway\" originally referred to the Bronx River Reservation, New York's first [[linear park]], of which the road is a portion, from the Bronx\u2013Westchester county line to [[Kensico Dam]] Plaza.  Current usage of the term is confined to the roadway, but extends it to the portion which now continues southward beyond the Reservation.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://parks.westchestergov.com/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=1900&Itemid=4466 |title=Bronx River Parkway Reservation |publisher=Westchester County Department of Parks |year=2008 |accessdate=November 6, 2010}}</ref>\n\n==Route description==\nThe southern third of the parkway, in the Bronx, is exclusively limited-access. It serves as a commuter route, intersecting several major east-west routes. Halfway through the borough it begins to closely parallel the [[Harlem Line]] of [[Metro-North Railroad]], a pairing which continues to the road's northern terminus.\n\nIn Westchester County, the road continues to have the same character until the [[Sprain Brook Parkway]] splits off at [[Bronxville, New York|Bronxville]], allowing most through traffic to bypass [[White Plains, New York|White Plains]]. The stretches north of that junction have more of the original park character, and are still used that way. North of White Plains the exits are at-grade intersections with traffic lights.\n\n===The Bronx===\nThe parkway begins at Story Avenue in the [[Bronx]] neighborhood of [[Soundview, Bronx|Soundview]], where two roadways merge near Metcalf and Morrison Avenues. Immediately to the north is the [[cloverleaf interchange]] at the [[Bruckner Expressway]] ([[Interstate&nbsp;278]] or I-278), where most traffic enters the parkway.<ref name=\"exit list southern half of parkway\">{{cite web|title=Bronx River Parkway Exit List (Sound View to Bronxville)|url=http://www.nycroads.com/exits/bronx-river_bronx/|website=nycroads.com|publisher=Eastern Roads, Inc.|accessdate=24 September 2014|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141101064919/http://www.nycroads.com/exits/bronx-river_bronx/|archivedate=1 November 2014}}</ref> Basketball courts and baseball fields flank the highway in the strip of parkland as the road leads to the north, slightly northwestward.

Vehicles continuing are now on the [[Sprain Brook Parkway]], for which this is the southern terminus; traffic for the BRP must exit. The exit numbers reset; the new exit&nbsp;1, Paxton Avenue in Bronxville, is on the northbound lanes just north of the split (exit&nbsp;1A allows southbound traffic to leave the parkway for Desmond Avenue just before merging). Exit&nbsp;2, West Pondfield Road, also northbound-only, is a thousand feet (300 m) to the north as the highway curves around downtown Bronxville to the east. Here, the road runs though the [[Armour Villa, Yonkers|Armour Villa neighborhood]] until it runs under the Tuckahoe Road bridge. Almost a mile (1.6&nbsp;km) separates it from the next exit, at Elm Street in [[Tuckahoe, Westchester County, New York|Tuckahoe]]. The park continues to parallel the parkway, with paved [[bike path]]s and a large pond. A thousand feet to the north, Scarsdale Road is the first at-grade interchange, and the parkway then turns sharply to the east, then back to the northeast more gradually. Exit&nbsp;8, Thompson Street, serves the nearby [[Crestwood (Metro-North station)|Crestwood]] station as the Harlem Line's tracks begin to parallel the road again. Another three-quarter mile north, after the road has resumed its northeast course, comes the next at-grade exit, Leewood Drive, on the northbound side.\n\nA quarter-mile (500 m) to the north are abandoned parking lots on both sides that were once gas stations. One-tenth of a mile (150 m) to the north, the roadways diverge and the river runs between them. Just beyond this is another at-grade interchange, Strathmore and Harney roads. The roadways remain apart through a wooded section as they curve westward for the next three-quarter mile, returning to the highway's northeastern heading as it leaves Yonkers and briefly enters [[Greenburgh, New York|Greenburgh]] south of the southbound Ardsley Road exit east of downtown [[Scarsdale, New York|Scarsdale]]. Just after it curves eastward again and crosses the Harlem Line, entering Scarsdale, traffic can enter and exit at Crane Road and East Parkway with southbound traffic using a light to cross over the northbound lanes and no entrance onto the southbound lanes. In the next {{convert|2.2|mi|adj=on}} stretch, there are exits for Ogden and Butler roads from the northbound lanes. Fenimore Road, just east of the [[Hartsdale, New York|Hartsdale]] and its [[Hartsdale (Metro-North station)|train station]], is a northbound exit with southbound entry. Just to its north, southbound traffic can exit onto Greenacres Avenue. The parkway begins heading even more to the northeast, the tracks immediately adjacent, past northbound exits for River and Claremont roads.\n\nJust north of the latter exit, the highway enters [[White Plains, New York|White Plains]], the Westchester [[county seat]]. After the northbound Walworth crossing exit, it turns northwest across the river and the tracks and then resumes its northeasterly course. A half-mile (1&nbsp;km) north it reaches the Main Street ([[New York State Route 119|NY&nbsp;119]]) northbound exit/southbound entrance, just west of the [[White Plains (Metro-North station)|White Plains]] station on the west side of heavily developed downtown White Plains. It bends north and then northwest to the first of several at-grade intersections with traffic lights, also signed and numbered as exits, with Central Avenue ([[New York State Route 100|NY&nbsp;100]]), at the [[Westchester County Center]]. From here parkway traffic is also directed toward the nearby Cross-Westchester Expressway ([[Interstate 287|I-287]]) via NY&nbsp;119, as the parkway has no direct interchange with it.\n\nThe two roadways once again diverge, becoming almost {{convert|400|ft}} apart in the half-mile (1&nbsp;km) before they converge again as they reach the Old Tarrytown Road intersection just north of the expressway. Beyond it the parkway goes due north before curving slightly into the Fisher Lane intersection just west of the last Metro-North station along the parkway, [[North White Plains (Metro-North station)|North White Plains]]. The Maryton and Virginia Road intersections follow, spaced roughly a thousand feet (300 m) apart. Another thousand feet from that intersection, the highway turns to the northeast again as the roadways diverge and cross the Harlem Line and the Bronx River for the last time. Northbound traffic has the last exit, exit&nbsp;27, onto Washington Avenue. [[Kensico Dam]] is visible in the distance as the parkway reaches its northern terminus at Kensico Circle, southern terminus of the [[Taconic State Parkway]], also listed on the Register.\n\nA seven-mile (11&nbsp;km) section of the Bronx River Parkway in Westchester County south of White Plains is closed to motorist traffic from 10 AM to 2 PM select Sundays in May, June and September (with the exception of Memorial and Labor Day weekends), allowing [[bicycle|bicyclists]] to venture along the scenic road.

During the ensuing battle Jean ends up in telepathic contact with Miss Sinister, who takes a keen interest in her. After the battle ends they decide to bring Jimmy with them to join their team instead of sending him to the school with [[Kitty Pryde]] in order to better protect him and keep him under the radar. While exploring Madripoor during a festival on a night off, Jean, Beast and Jimmy confront a group of mutants, known as the Raksha, who were buying a chemical from a local dealer. Upon seeing Jimmy's claws the Raksha voluntarily end the fight, acknowledging the X-Men as allies due to everyone involved having a positive history with [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]].<ref>''X-Men: Blue'' #4\u20136</ref>\n\n===Toil and Trobule===\nDuring the ''[[Secret Empire (comic book)|Secret Empire]]'' storyline, the team rebels against the government of New Tian, located somewhere in [[California]], following [[Hydra (comics)|Hydra]]'s takeover of the United States. While in their hideout, they're attacked by [[Havok (comics)|Havok]], [[Archangel (Marvel Comics)|Archangel]], [[Marrow (comics)|Marrow]], [[Firestar (Marvel Comics)|Firestar]], [[Wolfsbane (comics)|Wolfsbane]], [[Mondo (comics)|Mondo]] and [[Toad (comics)|Toad]] who were sent by [[Emma Frost]]. Each of them exhibited much stronger abilities which Beast concludes is due to secondary mutations. While Jean and Jimmy escape, the rest of the team is captured. Emma then talks to Cyclops in his cell. As Jean and Jimmy regroup and plan their next move they are rescued by [[Danger Room#Sentience|Danger]], who stages a series of elaborate holograms to keep Emma's forces occupied. The rest of the team begins to lose hope as Emma begins telepathically tormenting Cyclops. Havok is about to intercept Jean and Jimmy when he is suddenly ambushed by [[Polaris (Marvel Comics)|Polaris]]. While Polaris fights Havok, Jean and Jimmy manage to rescue their teammates and Briar until they're caught by Emma, who has upgraded her powers using a fragment of the [[Cosmic Cube]], allowing her to take control of Cyclops and force him to attack his teammates. Jean manages to release Cyclops from Emma's mental control and the team successfully escapes. Meanwhile, Magneto speaks with [[Captain America|Steve Rogers]] about the team's recent actions and Emma and Havok meet with Miss Sinister and Bastion.<ref>''X-Men: Blue'' #7\u20139</ref>\n\nSometime later, it's revealed that Beast has learned his magic from the [[Goblin Queen]], who was using him to free a group of demons known as the Hex-Men who take the form of [[Pixie (comics)|Pixie]], [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]], [[Bloodstorm (Marvel Comics)|Bloodstorm]] and [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]] so that she may begin a dark ritual to summon her fellow Queens to take the world as their own. Danger trains Iceman and notes that he is distracted which could endanger the team during a fight because his boyfriend Romeo has stopped replying to his calls and messages. Jean and Scott find out that, when she released him from Emma's mind control, that a unique, unbreakable connection had formed between them meaning that they will always be able to read each other's minds. This initially causes some conflict as Jean discovers that Scott is jealous of her budding relationship with Jimmy. While trying to make sense of their new connection, the pair almost kiss but are interrupted by a massive explosion as the Golbin Queen begins her attack. The team confronts the Goblin Queen and the Hex-Men, seeing Beast transformed into a demonic creature.  During the battle, Jean and Scott manage to escape with help from the teleporting demon Pickles and enlist the aid of the Raksha. Back at the mansion, the Goblin Queen and the Hex-Men manage to capture the rest of the team and begin a ritual to summon the Goblin Queen's sisters. During the ritual, Jean, Scott and the Rashka infiltrate the mansion and battle the Goblin Queen's demons. Bloodstorm realises that the promises made to her by the Golbin Queen are false and that she will dispose of the Hex-Men once her sisters have been summoned so she betrays her and convinces Beast to break the Goblin Queen's hold on him and banish her to the hellish dimension where her sisters have been trapped. In the aftermath, Bloodstorm, is welcomed into the team despite her worries that she will massacre them as she did to the X-Men of her own reality.\n\nMeanwhile, Angel and Jimmy return to Colorado and join forces with Kira to investigate Jimmy's mysterious past only to discover a hidden lab where they find [[Blob (comics)|Blob]], who had been experimented on by Miss Sinister. When they enter, a special holographic message from Miss Sinister activates because it is attuned to Jimmy's genetic code but Angel turns it off before they can hear what she has to say because he believes she is trying to manipulate them. Angel, Kira and Jimmy battle Blob until he starts to melt as a side effect of the experiments and Angel vows to help him. They realise that the mutants that attacked them in New Tian must have been experimented on by Miss Sinister as well, meaning their powers were not because of secondary mutations. After finding the bodies of dead mutants, they theorise that the experiments, which Sinister refers to as \"Mothervine\" must be harmful to mutants, killing some but greatly powering up those who survive.<ref>''X-Men: Blue'' #10-12</ref>\n\n===\"Mojo Worldwide\"===\nWhen the team are invited to the Xavier Institue by Kitty, their reunion is interrupted by three floating objects that land in various areas of New York. The Blue and [[X-Men Gold|Gold]] teams join forces and split off into groups to investigate. When they come into contact with the objects, a powerful force fields surrounds them that they are unable to escape from. The force fields create virtual reality constructs of [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]], [[Inferno (Marvel Comics)|Inferno]] and the [[Days of Future Past|Future]] that Rachel came from. Their clothing is transformed and the teams begin to fight off approaching enemies. It is revealed that [[Mojo (comics)|Mojo]], in an effort to boost his ratings, is creating a special \"greatest hits\" show that recreates famous X-Men battles from throughout their history and that he is broadcasting it live to audiences across the multiverse.<ref>''X-Men Gold'' #12</ref> The first team, consisting of Kitty, Prestige, Cyclops and Bloodstorm, try to rescue civilians in the Future but they are interrupted by Mojo who broadcasts his face onto an army of [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinels]]. Proving to them that the threats they face are real and not simply special effects, impales Bloodstorm on a metal spear, killing her. Prestige used Scott and Jean\u2019s psychic connection to boost her own telepathy, enabling her to contact Logan, Storm, Angel and Iceman who are trapped in Asgard battling Frost Trolls and Nightcrawler, Colossus, Jimmy, Beast and Marvel Girl who are fighting demons in Inferno to tell them that Mojo is behind everything. The first team is rescued from the Sentinels by [[Longshot (Marvel Comics)|Longshot]], who has hacked into Mojo's system and is broadcasting his adventures to his own subscribers. Mojo becomes angry when he is informed that his ratings are not rising as quickly as he expected so he begins showering his audience with gifts and encourages them to vote on which scenario they would like to see the X-Men face using an app.<ref>''X-Men Blue'' #13</ref>\n\nTransported to [[Asteroid M]], Longshot, Kitty, Prestige and Cyclops are forced to fight a simulation of Magneto. Scott then admits that the X-Men Blue have been working with Magneto and concludes that they never should have agreed as it is impossible for someone to change their behaviour so significantly. Meanwhile, Logan, Storm, Iceman and Angel are sent to the [[X-Tinction Agenda]] where they come under attack by the [[Magistrates (comics)|Magistrates]] and the [[Press Gang (comics)|Press Gang]] who swiftly kill the entire team. Meanwhile, Marvel Girl, Beast, Jimmy, Colossus and Nightcrawler are still fighting demons and are confronted by a simulation of the [[Goblin Queen]] who Jean manages to defeat, causing the team to be teleported to the [[Savage Land (comics)|Savage Land]].<ref>''X-Men Gold'' #13</ref> Mojo is delighted when [[Polaris (Marvel Comics)|Polaris]], [[Danger (comics)|Danger]] and the real Magneto arrive to rescue the X-Men, sending them into the [[Morlocks (comics)|Morlock tunnels]] to face the [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]] and the [[Marauders (comics)|Marauders]]. Longshot manages to teleport his team away from the Avengers.Still in the Savage land, Hank uses magic to fight off their enemies, much to the concern of Jean. Longshot and the others arrive and the survivng X-Men regroup before freeing the X-Men that had previously been \u201ckilled\u201d from stasis chambers on [[Mojo (comics)|Mojoworld]]. <ref>''X-Men Blue'' #14</ref>   Magneto, Polaris and Danger defeat Apocalypse but then come face-to-face with the [[Shi'ar]] and [[Krakoa]] although Danger manages to free them from the simulation. While the rest of the X-Men engage [[Spiral (comics)|Spiral]] and Mojo's forces, Kitty finds out the location of Mojo's control room.<ref>''X-Men Gold'' #16</ref> The team reach the control room for their final showdown with Mojo, who leeches energy from his viewers to increase his strength. He appears to be getting the upper hand until Magento and Polaris arrive and combine their powers to create an EMP that disables his broadcasting technology, leaving him helpless. Kitty berates the young X-Men for working with Magneto and confronts Magneto about his actions but Colossus convinces her to stand down. After teleporting away, Mojo and his crew are stranded on Earth but manage to set up their own news network.<ref>''X-Men Blue'' #15</ref>\n\n===\"Cross Time Capers\"===\nThe X-Men return to Magneto's mansion in Madripoor. Jean, concerned about Hank after he attempted to cast more spells, starts keeping an eye on him although Hank believes she is only hanging out with him in order to stay away from Scott, who she has started developing feelings for. Scott also tries to separate himself from Jean (even though their psychic rapport means the pair can never truly be alone) and grows closer to Bloodstorm, who he realises he has more in common with than he first thought. Bobby watches Mojo's new television show in which contestants attempt to survive a day being hunted by various creatures to win a cash prize. Polaris and Angel train Jimmy but they are interrupted when Polaris suddenly disappears. Sensing this, Jean and Hank rush to Mangeto who instructs her to read his mind. Jean discovers that Magneto has somehow been communicating with [[Professor Xavier]] from beyond the grave and, before disappearing, Magneto orders them into the labs underneath the mansion. The X-Men find out that Mangneto had been secretly building a time machine to send them back home and, believing they are to blame for the disappearances, Hank activates the machine in the hope that returning to their original time will fix the timestream. The machine mistakenly sends the team to [[X-Men 2099|2099]] where they are confronted by the X-Men of that timeline. Hank explains that he believes something has happened in their original time and, because the X-Men were not there to stop it, ripples through time are erasing people from existence. They find out 2099 is a dystopian future where the original five X-Men have destroyed the planet and leave most people to starve and die. Horrified, Hank and the team travel to another time in the hope of rewriting history so that this future will never happen. The device sends them to the wrong time period again and the X-Men are forced to battle the students of [[Generation X (comics)|Generation X]] but the battle is interrupted by the student's teachers [[Banshee (comics)|Banshee]] and Emma Frost, who reveal that the original X-Men turned on them and decimated any attempts at resistance. Hank finally manages to teleport the team back to their original time.<ref>''X-Men Blue'' #16-18</ref>\n\nIn the past, due to the absence of the X-Men when they travelled to the future, evil versions of the original X-Men from an alternate reality lead by Professor X took their place and killed Magneto using a nuclear missile. That time's original Xavier is kept hooked up to Cerebro but somehow managed to send a message through time to Magneto in the present asking for help. Hank manages to rescue Magneto just before his death and he reluctantly teams up with the X-Men. It is revealed that the evil X-Men are actually the [[Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]] who were last encountered by the team during the [[Battle of the Atom]] storyline. The teams engage each other in combat, with Beast teleporting in the 2099 X-Men and Generation X while Jean locates and rescues their Professor X from Cerebro. The Brotherhood jump back into the timestream before they can be apprehended and the X-Men have a tearful reunion with their Xavier, who explains that there is still things they must do before they can stay in their time, noting that when they do return for good, it must be from the exact moment in which they left. Sending them back to the present, the X-Men find that Magneto and the others have returned with no memory of what has happened, although Bobby quickly fills him in. The X-Men are disheartened that they must eventually return to the original time, with Bobby particularly upset that all of their growth as people will be undone. Magneto finds the Brotherhood in the timestream and kills them for what they have done.<ref>''X-Men Blue'' #19-20</ref>\n\n===\"Poison X\"===\nDuring Scott's video call between Scott and his father [[Corsair (comics)|Corsair]], he and the rest of the [[Starjammers]] are attacked by people wearing [[Symbiote (comics)|symbiotes]]. Before the call cuts off, Corsair shouts some co-ordinates to Scott which are also heard by Jean via their psychic rapport. Hoping to find answers, the X-Men intercept [[Venom (Eddie Brock)|Venom]] during one of his missions. While Eddie Brock refuses to go with the X-Men, his Venom symbiote wants to learn more about what is going on and puts him to sleep so that the X-Men can question him. They locate the Strarjammer's ship and are greeted by [[Sikorsky (comics)|Sikorsky]], who hid during the attack and explains more about the symbiotes that were responsible. Fearful of the damager they can do, Venom agrees to help the X-Men.<ref>''X-Men Blue'' Annual #1</ref> After barely surviving an encounter with some of the symbiotes, Scott is badly wounded an the X-Men retreat while Venom manages to track down the arms dealer responsible for selling the symbiotes however, once inside, a battle ensues causing some of the symbiotes to bond with the X-Men. The team board the ship of the symbiote-wearing bounty hunters who have been holding the Starjammers hostage and incapacitate them, enabling Scott to free his father. Jean's psychic link is suddenly severed and it is revealed that Poisons, special symbiotes that completely take over a host and turn them into a weapon, have boarded the ship and bonded with her, killing her.<ref>''X-Men Blue'' #21-22</ref>\n\n===\"Cry Havok\"===\nMagneto discovers that Emma Frost and the Hellfire Club are planning something and heads to their mansion to investigate, coming face to face with [[Sebastian Shaw (comics)|Sebastian Shaw]] whose powers have been augmented by Miss Sinister. Although they pretend to be in league with Miss Sinister and [[Bastion (comics)|Bastion]] (who are planning to use their combined technology to cause an increase in the mutant population), Havok and Emma Frost privately conspire to double cross them when the moment arises. [[Malice (comics)|Malice]] is revealed to have possessed Polaris and, although she manages to break free, Malice has already gravely injured the Raksha leaving only one, Gazing Nightshade, unharmed. Jimmy and Bloodstorm rescue [[Xorn (comics)|Xorn]] from a group of [[Marauders (comics)|Marauders]] and regroup with Polaris, Gazing Nightshade and new recruit [[Daken]] to form a new team of X-Men. Mangeto meets with Miss Sinister, Bastion, Havok and Emma and tries to convince them to reconsider their actions but they refuse and defeat him. The group unleash their technology and mutants all over the world begin to develop new mutations that they are unable to control. Miss Sinister reveals that their technology also takes away their free will, allowing her to control them and, while Emma is taken aback, Havok explains that he knew all along and supports her plan. The X-Men do battle with the mutants and are captured while Magneto flees and meets with [[Exodus (comics)|Exodus]] and [[Elixir (comics)|Elixir]] who help him to heal the new mutants. Emma turns on Sinister and frees Jimmy, who kills Sinister, before releasing the rest of the X-Men. Xorn sacrifices himself to kill Bastion and Polaris, with Emma's help, breaks through to Havok and makes him see the error of his ways. Emma meets with Magneto, who vows to destroy her for what she has done. In the depths of space, a traumatised Cyclops is unable to come to terms with Jean's death and, despite having some difficulty, Beast manages to fly their ship back home.<ref>''X-Men Blue'' #23-28</ref>\n\n===\"Surviving the Experience\"===\nFollowing an invasion of Earth by the Poisons, which results and Jean being resurrected, the X-Men search for Jimmy, who was taken over by one of the last surviving Poisons.<ref>''Venomized'' #5</ref> They track him to the woods where they try to break through to Jimmy and encourage him to fight against the Poison which is controlling him but they are interrupted by Daken who announces that he has been sent by Magneto to assassinate Jimmy. Jean lets Jimmy go off to find himself. Searching for Emma, Magneto attacks several Hellfire Club parties and kills everyone in attendance. The X-Men investigate, shocked that Magneto is capable of such things but Bloodstorm explains that, while the X-Men were in space, Magneto was forced to kill some of the mind-controlled mutants he had sworn to protect and that he is now seeking revenge on those that caused it. The X-Men track Emma to France and offer to help protect her from Magneto, who subsequently attacks with powers enhanced using mutant growth hormone. After they help Emma escape, it becomes clear that Magneto is too powerful for the X-Men and, not wanting to kill the team he had mentored, Magneto leaves. Jean meets with her adult self and the two speak about their various resurrections. The younger Jean expresses her wish that they would have had more time to get to know one another but that the time-displaced X-Men must return to their original time soon. She expresses her sadness that their minds must all be erased of their experiences in the present so that they do not change things when they return to the past. Young Hank reconciles with the present version of Best and asks him to find a way to make them forget who they are. During a game of pool with his older self, Bobby breaks down in the knowledge that he will be forced back into the closet when he returns to his original time. Iceman tries to reassure him that he will grow up to be someone awesome but younger Bobby admits that he quite likes the person he's become but the option to remain that person is no longer possible. Angel catches up to Archangel to say goodbye. Scott and Bloodstorm visit the adult Cyclops' grave and Scott comes to terms with the fact that he won't be a part of the future and that going back to their timeline is ensuring this. The X-Men meet in a Florida military base (the first place they became an official team in X-Men #1 in 1963) and resolve to tie up some loose ends. They destroy Mojo's new TV network, Scott says goodbye to Corsair and the Starjammers and recruit the Raksha as official X-Men who are to be trained by Danger and Polaris. At the X-Mansion, Jean and Scott finally give into their feelings and share a kiss. As they prepare to travel back in time, they see a news report that Magneto has formed a new Brotherhood and is attacking a nearby city so the X-Men resolve to stay in the present for just a little while longer.<ref>''X-Men Blue'' #29-36</ref>\n\n== Team roster ==\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible\" style=\"margin:1em auto 1em auto;\"\n|-\n!width=15%| Character\n!width=25%| Real name\n!width=30%| Joined in\n!width=30%| Notes\n|-\n|[[Jean Grey#Time-Displaced Jean Grey|Marvel Girl]]\n|Jean Grey\n| rowspan=\"5\" |''X-Men Blue'' #1 (April 2017)\n| rowspan=\"5\" |Displaced teenage versions from an unknown alternate reality.\n|-\n|[[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)#Time-Displaced Cyclops|Cyclops]]\n|Scott \"Slim\" Summers\n|-\n|[[Iceman (character)#Time-displaced Iceman|Iceman]]\n|Robert \"Bobby\" Drake\n|-\n|[[Beast (comics)#Time-Displaced Beast|Beast]]\n|Henry \"Hank\" McCoy\n|-\n|[[Warren Worthington III#Time-Displaced Warren Worthington III|Angel]]\n|Warren Worthington III\n|-\n|[[Jimmy Hudson|Poison]]\n|Jimmy Hudson\n|''X-Men Blue'' #5 (June 2017)\n|Wolverine's son from the [[Ultimate Marvel|Ultimate Marvel Universe]].

During the ensuing battle Jean ends up in telepathic contact with Miss Sinister, who takes a keen interest in her. After the battle ends they decide to bring Jimmy with them to join their team instead of sending him to the school with [[Kitty Pryde]] in order to better protect him and keep him under the radar. While exploring Madripoor during a festival on a night off, Jean, Beast and Jimmy confront a group of mutants, known as the Raksha, who were buying a chemical from a local dealer.

Emma then talks to Cyclops in his cell. As Jean and Jimmy regroup and plan their next move they are rescued by [[Danger Room#Sentience|Danger]], who stages a series of elaborate holograms to keep Emma's forces occupied. The rest of the team begins to lose hope as Emma begins telepathically tormenting Cyclops. Havok is about to intercept Jean and Jimmy when he is suddenly ambushed by [[Polaris (Marvel Comics)|Polaris]]. While Polaris fights Havok, Jean and Jimmy manage to rescue their teammates and Briar until they're caught by Emma, who has upgraded her powers using a fragment of the [[Cosmic Cube]], allowing her to take control of Cyclops and force him to attack his teammates. Jean manages to release Cyclops from Emma's mental control and the team successfully escapes. Meanwhile, Magneto speaks with [[Captain America|Steve Rogers]] about the team's recent actions and Emma and Havok meet with Miss Sinister and Bastion.<ref>''X-Men: Blue'' #7\u20139</ref>\n\nSometime later, it's revealed that Beast has learned his magic from the [[Goblin Queen]], who was using him to free a group of demons known as the Hex-Men who take the form of [[Pixie (comics)|Pixie]], [[Colossus (comics)|Colossus]], [[Bloodstorm (Marvel Comics)|Bloodstorm]] and [[Nightcrawler (comics)|Nightcrawler]] so that she may begin a dark ritual to summon her fellow Queens to take the world as their own. Danger trains Iceman and notes that he is distracted which could endanger the team during a fight because his boyfriend Romeo has stopped replying to his calls and messages. Jean and Scott find out that, when she released him from Emma's mind control, that a unique, unbreakable connection had formed between them meaning that they will always be able to read each other's minds. This initially causes some conflict as Jean discovers that Scott is jealous of her budding relationship with Jimmy. While trying to make sense of their new connection, the pair almost kiss but are interrupted by a massive explosion as the Golbin Queen begins her attack. The team confronts the Goblin Queen and the Hex-Men, seeing Beast transformed into a demonic creature.  During the battle, Jean and Scott manage to escape with help from the teleporting demon Pickles and enlist the aid of the Raksha. Back at the mansion, the Goblin Queen and the Hex-Men manage to capture the rest of the team and begin a ritual to summon the Goblin Queen's sisters. During the ritual, Jean, Scott and the Rashka infiltrate the mansion and battle the Goblin Queen's demons. Bloodstorm realises that the promises made to her by the Golbin Queen are false and that she will dispose of the Hex-Men once her sisters have been summoned so she betrays her and convinces Beast to break the Goblin Queen's hold on him and banish her to the hellish dimension where her sisters have been trapped. In the aftermath, Bloodstorm, is welcomed into the team despite her worries that she will massacre them as she did to the X-Men of her own reality.\n\nMeanwhile, Angel and Jimmy return to Colorado and join forces with Kira to investigate Jimmy's mysterious past only to discover a hidden lab where they find [[Blob (comics)|Blob]], who had been experimented on by Miss Sinister. When they enter, a special holographic message from Miss Sinister activates because it is attuned to Jimmy's genetic code but Angel turns it off before they can hear what she has to say because he believes she is trying to manipulate them. Angel, Kira and Jimmy battle Blob until he starts to melt as a side effect of the experiments and Angel vows to help him. They realise that the mutants that attacked them in New Tian must have been experimented on by Miss Sinister as well, meaning their powers were not because of secondary mutations. After finding the bodies of dead mutants, they theorise that the experiments, which Sinister refers to as \"Mothervine\" must be harmful to mutants, killing some but greatly powering up those who survive.<ref>''X-Men: Blue'' #10-12</ref>\n\n===\"Mojo Worldwide\"===\nWhen the team are invited to the Xavier Institue by Kitty, their reunion is interrupted by three floating objects that land in various areas of New York. The Blue and [[X-Men Gold|Gold]] teams join forces and split off into groups to investigate. When they come into contact with the objects, a powerful force fields surrounds them that they are unable to escape from. The force fields create virtual reality constructs of [[Asgard (comics)|Asgard]], [[Inferno (Marvel Comics)|Inferno]] and the [[Days of Future Past|Future]] that Rachel came from. Their clothing is transformed and the teams begin to fight off approaching enemies. It is revealed that [[Mojo (comics)|Mojo]], in an effort to boost his ratings, is creating a special \"greatest hits\" show that recreates famous X-Men battles from throughout their history and that he is broadcasting it live to audiences across the multiverse.<ref>''X-Men Gold'' #12</ref> The first team, consisting of Kitty, Prestige, Cyclops and Bloodstorm, try to rescue civilians in the Future but they are interrupted by Mojo who broadcasts his face onto an army of [[Sentinel (comics)|Sentinels]]. Proving to them that the threats they face are real and not simply special effects, impales Bloodstorm on a metal spear, killing her. Prestige used Scott and Jean\u2019s psychic connection to boost her own telepathy, enabling her to contact Logan, Storm, Angel and Iceman who are trapped in Asgard battling Frost Trolls and Nightcrawler, Colossus, Jimmy, Beast and Marvel Girl who are fighting demons in Inferno to tell them that Mojo is behind everything. The first team is rescued from the Sentinels by [[Longshot (Marvel Comics)|Longshot]], who has hacked into Mojo's system and is broadcasting his adventures to his own subscribers. Mojo becomes angry when he is informed that his ratings are not rising as quickly as he expected so he begins showering his audience with gifts and encourages them to vote on which scenario they would like to see the X-Men face using an app.<ref>''X-Men Blue'' #13</ref>\n\nTransported to [[Asteroid M]], Longshot, Kitty, Prestige and Cyclops are forced to fight a simulation of Magneto. Scott then admits that the X-Men Blue have been working with Magneto and concludes that they never should have agreed as it is impossible for someone to change their behaviour so significantly. Meanwhile, Logan, Storm, Iceman and Angel are sent to the [[X-Tinction Agenda]] where they come under attack by the [[Magistrates (comics)|Magistrates]] and the [[Press Gang (comics)|Press Gang]] who swiftly kill the entire team. Meanwhile, Marvel Girl, Beast, Jimmy, Colossus and Nightcrawler are still fighting demons and are confronted by a simulation of the [[Goblin Queen]] who Jean manages to defeat, causing the team to be teleported to the [[Savage Land (comics)|Savage Land]].<ref>''X-Men Gold'' #13</ref> Mojo is delighted when [[Polaris (Marvel Comics)|Polaris]], [[Danger (comics)|Danger]] and the real Magneto arrive to rescue the X-Men, sending them into the [[Morlocks (comics)|Morlock tunnels]] to face the [[Apocalypse (comics)|Apocalypse]] and the [[Marauders (comics)|Marauders]]. Longshot manages to teleport his team away from the Avengers.Still in the Savage land, Hank uses magic to fight off their enemies, much to the concern of Jean. Longshot and the others arrive and the survivng X-Men regroup before freeing the X-Men that had previously been \u201ckilled\u201d from stasis chambers on [[Mojo (comics)|Mojoworld]]. <ref>''X-Men Blue'' #14</ref>   Magneto, Polaris and Danger defeat Apocalypse but then come face-to-face with the [[Shi'ar]] and [[Krakoa]] although Danger manages to free them from the simulation. While the rest of the X-Men engage [[Spiral (comics)|Spiral]] and Mojo's forces, Kitty finds out the location of Mojo's control room.<ref>''X-Men Gold'' #16</ref> The team reach the control room for their final showdown with Mojo, who leeches energy from his viewers to increase his strength. He appears to be getting the upper hand until Magento and Polaris arrive and combine their powers to create an EMP that disables his broadcasting technology, leaving him helpless. Kitty berates the young X-Men for working with Magneto and confronts Magneto about his actions but Colossus convinces her to stand down. After teleporting away, Mojo and his crew are stranded on Earth but manage to set up their own news network.<ref>''X-Men Blue'' #15</ref>\n\n===\"Cross Time Capers\"===\nThe X-Men return to Magneto's mansion in Madripoor. Jean, concerned about Hank after he attempted to cast more spells, starts keeping an eye on him although Hank believes she is only hanging out with him in order to stay away from Scott, who she has started developing feelings for. Scott also tries to separate himself from Jean (even though their psychic rapport means the pair can never truly be alone) and grows closer to Bloodstorm, who he realises he has more in common with than he first thought. Bobby watches Mojo's new television show in which contestants attempt to survive a day being hunted by various creatures to win a cash prize. Polaris and Angel train Jimmy but they are interrupted when Polaris suddenly disappears. Sensing this, Jean and Hank rush to Mangeto who instructs her to read his mind. Jean discovers that Magneto has somehow been communicating with [[Professor Xavier]] from beyond the grave and, before disappearing, Magneto orders them into the labs underneath the mansion. The X-Men find out that Mangneto had been secretly building a time machine to send them back home and, believing they are to blame for the disappearances, Hank activates the machine in the hope that returning to their original time will fix the timestream. The machine mistakenly sends the team to [[X-Men 2099|2099]] where they are confronted by the X-Men of that timeline. Hank explains that he believes something has happened in their original time and, because the X-Men were not there to stop it, ripples through time are erasing people from existence. They find out 2099 is a dystopian future where the original five X-Men have destroyed the planet and leave most people to starve and die. Horrified, Hank and the team travel to another time in the hope of rewriting history so that this future will never happen. The device sends them to the wrong time period again and the X-Men are forced to battle the students of [[Generation X (comics)|Generation X]] but the battle is interrupted by the student's teachers [[Banshee (comics)|Banshee]] and Emma Frost, who reveal that the original X-Men turned on them and decimated any attempts at resistance. Hank finally manages to teleport the team back to their original time.<ref>''X-Men Blue'' #16-18</ref>\n\nIn the past, due to the absence of the X-Men when they travelled to the future, evil versions of the original X-Men from an alternate reality lead by Professor X took their place and killed Magneto using a nuclear missile. That time's original Xavier is kept hooked up to Cerebro but somehow managed to send a message through time to Magneto in the present asking for help. Hank manages to rescue Magneto just before his death and he reluctantly teams up with the X-Men. It is revealed that the evil X-Men are actually the [[Brotherhood of Evil Mutants]] who were last encountered by the team during the [[Battle of the Atom]] storyline. The teams engage each other in combat, with Beast teleporting in the 2099 X-Men and Generation X while Jean locates and rescues their Professor X from Cerebro. The Brotherhood jump back into the timestream before they can be apprehended and the X-Men have a tearful reunion with their Xavier, who explains that there is still things they must do before they can stay in their time, noting that when they do return for good, it must be from the exact moment in which they left. Sending them back to the present, the X-Men find that Magneto and the others have returned with no memory of what has happened, although Bobby quickly fills him in. The X-Men are disheartened that they must eventually return to the original time, with Bobby particularly upset that all of their growth as people will be undone. Magneto finds the Brotherhood in the timestream and kills them for what they have done.<ref>''X-Men Blue'' #19-20</ref>\n\n===\"Poison X\"===\nDuring Scott's video call between Scott and his father [[Corsair (comics)|Corsair]], he and the rest of the [[Starjammers]] are attacked by people wearing [[Symbiote (comics)|symbiotes]]. Before the call cuts off, Corsair shouts some co-ordinates to Scott which are also heard by Jean via their psychic rapport. Hoping to find answers, the X-Men intercept [[Venom (Eddie Brock)|Venom]] during one of his missions. While Eddie Brock refuses to go with the X-Men, his Venom symbiote wants to learn more about what is going on and puts him to sleep so that the X-Men can question him. They locate the Strarjammer's ship and are greeted by [[Sikorsky (comics)|Sikorsky]], who hid during the attack and explains more about the symbiotes that were responsible. Fearful of the damager they can do, Venom agrees to help the X-Men.<ref>''X-Men Blue'' Annual #1</ref> After barely surviving an encounter with some of the symbiotes, Scott is badly wounded an the X-Men retreat while Venom manages to track down the arms dealer responsible for selling the symbiotes however, once inside, a battle ensues causing some of the symbiotes to bond with the X-Men. The team board the ship of the symbiote-wearing bounty hunters who have been holding the Starjammers hostage and incapacitate them, enabling Scott to free his father. Jean's psychic link is suddenly severed and it is revealed that Poisons, special symbiotes that completely take over a host and turn them into a weapon, have boarded the ship and bonded with her, killing her.<ref>''X-Men Blue'' #21-22</ref>\n\n===\"Cry Havok\"===\nMagneto discovers that Emma Frost and the Hellfire Club are planning something and heads to their mansion to investigate, coming face to face with [[Sebastian Shaw (comics)|Sebastian Shaw]] whose powers have been augmented by Miss Sinister. Although they pretend to be in league with Miss Sinister and [[Bastion (comics)|Bastion]] (who are planning to use their combined technology to cause an increase in the mutant population), Havok and Emma Frost privately conspire to double cross them when the moment arises. [[Malice (comics)|Malice]] is revealed to have possessed Polaris and, although she manages to break free, Malice has already gravely injured the Raksha leaving only one, Gazing Nightshade, unharmed. Jimmy and Bloodstorm rescue [[Xorn (comics)|Xorn]] from a group of [[Marauders (comics)|Marauders]] and regroup with Polaris, Gazing Nightshade and new recruit [[Daken]] to form a new team of X-Men. Mangeto meets with Miss Sinister, Bastion, Havok and Emma and tries to convince them to reconsider their actions but they refuse and defeat him. The group unleash their technology and mutants all over the world begin to develop new mutations that they are unable to control. Miss Sinister reveals that their technology also takes away their free will, allowing her to control them and, while Emma is taken aback, Havok explains that he knew all along and supports her plan. The X-Men do battle with the mutants and are captured while Magneto flees and meets with [[Exodus (comics)|Exodus]] and [[Elixir (comics)|Elixir]] who help him to heal the new mutants. Emma turns on Sinister and frees Jimmy, who kills Sinister, before releasing the rest of the X-Men. Xorn sacrifices himself to kill Bastion and Polaris, with Emma's help, breaks through to Havok and makes him see the error of his ways. Emma meets with Magneto, who vows to destroy her for what she has done. In the depths of space, a traumatised Cyclops is unable to come to terms with Jean's death and, despite having some difficulty, Beast manages to fly their ship back home.<ref>''X-Men Blue'' #23-28</ref>\n\n===\"Surviving the Experience\"===\nFollowing an invasion of Earth by the Poisons, which results and Jean being resurrected, the X-Men search for Jimmy, who was taken over by one of the last surviving Poisons.<ref>''Venomized'' #5</ref> They track him to the woods where they try to break through to Jimmy and encourage him to fight against the Poison which is controlling him but they are interrupted by Daken who announces that he has been sent by Magneto to assassinate Jimmy. Jean lets Jimmy go off to find himself. Searching for Emma, Magneto attacks several Hellfire Club parties and kills everyone in attendance. The X-Men investigate, shocked that Magneto is capable of such things but Bloodstorm explains that, while the X-Men were in space, Magneto was forced to kill some of the mind-controlled mutants he had sworn to protect and that he is now seeking revenge on those that caused it. The X-Men track Emma to France and offer to help protect her from Magneto, who subsequently attacks with powers enhanced using mutant growth hormone. After they help Emma escape, it becomes clear that Magneto is too powerful for the X-Men and, not wanting to kill the team he had mentored, Magneto leaves. Jean meets with her adult self and the two speak about their various resurrections. The younger Jean expresses her wish that they would have had more time to get to know one another but that the time-displaced X-Men must return to their original time soon. She expresses her sadness that their minds must all be erased of their experiences in the present so that they do not change things when they return to the past. Young Hank reconciles with the present version of Best and asks him to find a way to make them forget who they are. During a game of pool with his older self, Bobby breaks down in the knowledge that he will be forced back into the closet when he returns to his original time. Iceman tries to reassure him that he will grow up to be someone awesome but younger Bobby admits that he quite likes the person he's become but the option to remain that person is no longer possible. Angel catches up to Archangel to say goodbye. Scott and Bloodstorm visit the adult Cyclops' grave and Scott comes to terms with the fact that he won't be a part of the future and that going back to their timeline is ensuring this. The X-Men meet in a Florida military base (the first place they became an official team in X-Men #1 in 1963) and resolve to tie up some loose ends. They destroy Mojo's new TV network, Scott says goodbye to Corsair and the Starjammers and recruit the Raksha as official X-Men who are to be trained by Danger and Polaris. At the X-Mansion, Jean and Scott finally give into their feelings and share a kiss. As they prepare to travel back in time, they see a news report that Magneto has formed a new Brotherhood and is attacking a nearby city so the X-Men resolve to stay in the present for just a little while longer.<ref>''X-Men Blue'' #29-36</ref>\n\n== Team roster ==\n{| class=\"wikitable collapsible\" style=\"margin:1em auto 1em auto;\"\n|-\n!width=15%| Character\n!width=25%| Real name\n!width=30%| Joined in\n!width=30%| Notes\n|-\n|[[Jean Grey#Time-Displaced Jean Grey|Marvel Girl]]\n|Jean Grey\n| rowspan=\"5\" |''X-Men Blue'' #1 (April 2017)\n| rowspan=\"5\" |Displaced teenage versions from an unknown alternate reality.\n|-\n|[[Cyclops (Marvel Comics)#Time-Displaced Cyclops|Cyclops]]\n|Scott \"Slim\" Summers\n|-\n|[[Iceman (character)#Time-displaced Iceman|Iceman]]\n|Robert \"Bobby\" Drake\n|-\n|[[Beast (comics)#Time-Displaced Beast|Beast]]\n|Henry \"Hank\" McCoy\n|-\n|[[Warren Worthington III#Time-Displaced Warren Worthington III|Angel]]\n|Warren Worthington III\n|-\n|[[Jimmy Hudson|Poison]]\n|Jimmy Hudson\n|''X-Men Blue'' #5 (June 2017)\n|Wolverine's son from the [[Ultimate Marvel|Ultimate Marvel Universe]].
