For instance, a liquid crystal may flow like a liquid, but its [[molecules]] may be oriented in a crystal-like way. There are many different types of liquid-crystal [[Phase (matter)|phases]], which can be distinguished by their different [[Optics|optical]] properties (such as [[Texture (crystalline)|textures]]). The contrasting areas in the textures correspond to domains where the liquid-crystal molecules are oriented in different directions. Within a domain, however, the molecules are well ordered. LC materials may not always be in a liquid-crystal state of matter (just as water may turn into ice or water vapor).\n\nLiquid crystals can be divided into [[thermotropic]], [[lyotropic]] and metallotropic phases. Thermotropic and lyotropic liquid crystals consist mostly of [[organic molecules]], although a few minerals are also known. Thermotropic LCs exhibit a [[phase transition]] into the liquid-crystal phase as temperature is changed. Lyotropic LCs exhibit phase transitions as a function of both temperature and [[concentration]] of the liquid-crystal molecules in a [[solvent]] (typically water). Metallotropic LCs are composed of both organic and inorganic molecules; their liquid-crystal transition depends not only on temperature and concentration, but also on the inorganic-organic composition ratio.\n\nExamples of liquid crystals can be found both in the natural world and in technological applications. Widespread [[Liquid-crystal display]]s use liquid crystals. Lyotropic liquid-crystalline phases are abundant in living systems but can also be found in the mineral world. For example, many proteins and cell membranes are liquid crystals. Other well-known examples of liquid crystals are solutions of [[soap]] and various related [[detergent]]s, as well as the [[tobacco mosaic virus]], and some [[clays]].\n\n==History==\nIn 1888, Austrian botanical physiologist [[Friedrich Reinitzer]], working at the [[Karl-Ferdinands-Universit\u00e4t]], examined the physico-chemical properties of various [[Derivative (chemistry)|derivatives]] of [[cholesterol]] which now belong to the class of materials known as cholesteric liquid crystals. Previously, other researchers had observed distinct color effects when cooling cholesterol derivatives just above the [[freezing point]], but had not associated it with a new phenomenon. Reinitzer perceived that color changes in a derivative [[cholesteryl benzoate]] were not the most peculiar feature.[[File:Cholesteryl benzoate.png|thumb|250 px|Chemical structure of [[cholesteryl benzoate]] molecule]] He found that cholesteryl benzoate does not [[melting|melt]] in the same manner as other compounds, but has two [[melting point]]s. At {{convert|145.5|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} it melts into a cloudy liquid, and at {{convert|178.5|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} it melts again and the cloudy liquid becomes clear. The phenomenon is reversible. Seeking help from a physicist, on March 14, 1888, he wrote to [[Otto Lehmann (physicist)|Otto Lehmann]], at that time a ''{{lang|de|[[Privatdozent]]}}'' in [[Aachen]]. They exchanged letters and samples. Lehmann examined the intermediate cloudy fluid, and reported seeing [[crystallite]]s. Reinitzer's Viennese colleague von Zepharovich also indicated that the intermediate \"fluid\" was crystalline. The exchange of letters with Lehmann ended on April 24, with many questions unanswered. Reinitzer presented his results, with credits to Lehmann and von Zepharovich, at a meeting of the Vienna Chemical Society on May 3, 1888.<ref>{{cite journal| title = Beitr\u00e4ge zur Kenntniss des Cholesterins| journal=Monatshefte f\u00fcr Chemie| volume = 9| issue =1| pages = 421\u2013441|date =1888| doi =10.1007/BF01516710| last1 = Reinitzer| first1 = Friedrich}}</ref>\n\nBy that time, Reinitzer had discovered and described three important features of cholesteric liquid crystals (the name coined by Otto Lehmann in 1904): the existence of two melting points, the reflection of [[circular polarization|circularly polarized light]], and the ability to rotate the polarization direction of light.\n\nAfter his accidental discovery, Reinitzer did not pursue studying liquid crystals further. The research was continued by Lehmann, who realized that he had encountered a new phenomenon and was in a position to investigate it: In his postdoctoral years he had acquired expertise in crystallography and microscopy. Lehmann started a systematic study, first of cholesteryl benzoate, and then of related compounds which exhibited the double-melting phenomenon. He was able to make observations in polarized light, and his microscope was equipped with a hot stage (sample holder equipped with a heater) enabling high temperature observations. The intermediate cloudy phase clearly sustained flow, but other features, particularly the signature under a microscope, convinced Lehmann that he was dealing with a solid. By the end of August 1889 he had published his results in the [[Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Physikalische Chemie]].<ref>{{cite journal| author=Lehmann, O. |doi=10.1515/zpch-1889-0434| title = \u00dcber fliessende Krystalle| journal=Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Physikalische Chemie|volume =4| pages = 462\u201372|date =1889}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Otto Lehmann.jpg|thumb|180px|Otto Lehmann]]\nLehmann's work was continued and significantly expanded by the German chemist [[Daniel Vorl\u00e4nder]], who from the beginning of 20th century until his retirement in 1935, had synthesized most of the liquid crystals known. However, liquid crystals were not popular among scientists and the material remained a pure scientific curiosity for about 80 years.<ref name=b3/>\n\nAfter World War II work on the synthesis of liquid crystals was restarted at university research laboratories in Europe. [[George William Gray]], a prominent researcher of liquid crystals, began investigating these materials in England in the late 1940s. His group synthesized many new materials that exhibited the liquid crystalline state and developed a better understanding of how to design molecules that exhibit the state. His book ''Molecular Structure and the Properties of Liquid Crystals''<ref>Gray, G. W. (1962) ''Molecular Structure and the Properties of Liquid Crystals'', Academic Press</ref> became a guidebook on the subject. One of the first U.S. chemists to study liquid crystals was Glenn H. Brown, starting in 1953 at the [[University of Cincinnati]] and later at [[Kent State University]]. In 1965, he organized the first international conference on liquid crystals, in Kent, Ohio, with about 100 of the world's top liquid crystal scientists in attendance. This conference marked the beginning of a worldwide effort to perform research in this field, which soon led to the development of practical applications for these unique materials.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/13583149408628630|title=Professor Horst Sackmann, 1921 \u2013 1993|date=1994|last1=Stegemeyer|first1=H|journal=Liquid Crystals Today|volume=4|pages=1\u20132}}</ref><ref>[http://www1.kfupm.edu.sa/phys101/docs/Physics%20Success%20Stories%20-%20Physics%20On%20Display.htm Liquid Crystals] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20120805230930/http://www1.kfupm.edu.sa/phys101/docs/Physics%20Success%20Stories%20-%20Physics%20On%20Display.htm |date=August 5, 2012 }}. kfupm.edu.sa</ref>\n\nLiquid crystal materials became a focus of research in the development of flat panel electronic displays beginning in 1962 at [[RCA]] Laboratories.<ref name=castellano/> When physical chemist Richard Williams applied an electric field to a thin layer of a [[#Nematic_phase|nematic]] liquid crystal at 125&nbsp;\u00b0C, he observed the formation of a regular pattern that he called domains (now known as Williams Domains). This led his colleague [[George H. Heilmeier]] to perform research on a liquid crystal-based flat panel display to replace the cathode ray vacuum tube used in televisions. But the [[para-Azoxyanisole]] that Williams and Heilmeier used exhibits the nematic liquid crystal state only above 116&nbsp;\u00b0C, which made it impractical to use in a commercial display product. A material that could be operated at room temperature was clearly needed.\n\nIn 1966, Joel E. Goldmacher and Joseph A. Castellano, research chemists in Heilmeier group at RCA, discovered that mixtures made exclusively of nematic compounds that differed only in the number of carbon atoms in the terminal side chains could yield room-temperature nematic liquid crystals. A ternary mixture of [[Schiff base]] compounds resulted in a material that had a nematic range of 22\u2013105&nbsp;\u00b0C.<ref>Goldmacher, Joel E. and Castellano, Joseph A. \"Electro-optical Compositions and Devices,\" {{US Patent|3540796}}, Issue date: November 17, 1970.</ref> Operation at room temperature enabled the first practical display device to be made.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1063/1.1652453|title=Dynamic Scattering in Nematic Liquid Crystals|date=1968|last1=Heilmeier|first1=G.

This technique of mixing nematic compounds to obtain wide [[operating temperature]] range eventually became the industry standard and is still used to tailor materials to meet specific applications.\n\n[[File:MBBA cleaner.svg|thumb|Chemical structure of [[MBBA|N-(4-Methoxybenzylidene)-4-butylaniline (MBBA)]] molecule]]\nIn 1969, Hans Kelker succeeded in synthesizing a substance that had a nematic phase at room temperature, [[MBBA]], which is one of the most popular subjects of liquid crystal research.<ref>{{cite journal| journal=Angew.

Despite significant differences in chemical composition, these molecules have some common features in chemical and physical properties. There are three types of thermotropic liquid crystals: discotic, conic (bowlic), and rod-shaped molecules. Discotics are flat disc-like molecules consisting of a core of adjacent aromatic rings; the core in a conic LC is not flat, but is shaped like a rice bowl (a three-dimensional object).<ref>Lam, Lui (1994). \"Bowlics\".

One can distinguish positional order (whether molecules are arranged in any sort of ordered lattice) and orientational order (whether molecules are mostly pointing in the same direction), and moreover order can be either short-range (only between molecules close to each other) or long-range (extending to larger, sometimes [[macroscopic scale|macroscopic]], dimensions). Most thermotropic LCs will have an [[isotropic]] phase at high temperature. That is that heating will eventually drive them into a conventional liquid phase characterized by random and isotropic molecular ordering (little to no long-range order), and [[fluid]]-like flow behavior. Under other conditions (for instance, lower temperature), a LC might inhabit one or more phases with significant  [[anisotropic]] orientational structure and short-range orientational order while still having an ability to flow.<ref name=b2>\n{{cite book|author=Chandrasekhar, S.|title=Liquid Crystals|edition = 2nd|location = Cambridge|publisher=Cambridge University Press|date=1992|isbn=978-0-521-41747-1|url=https://books.google.com/?id=TxvUxFlQsEsC&printsec=frontcover|author-link=Sivaramakrishna Chandrasekhar}}\n</ref><ref name=b1>\n{{cite book|author=[[Pierre-Gilles de Gennes|de Gennes, P.G.]] and Prost, J|title=The Physics of Liquid Crystals|location = Oxford|publisher=Clarendon Press|date=1993|isbn=978-0-19-852024-5}}\n</ref>\n\nThe ordering of liquid crystalline phases is extensive on the molecular scale. This order extends up to the entire domain size, which may be on the order of micrometers, but usually does not extend to the macroscopic scale as often occurs in classical [[crystal]]line solids. However some techniques, such as the use of boundaries or an applied [[electric field]], can be used to enforce a single ordered domain in a macroscopic liquid crystal sample. The orientational ordering in a liquid crystal might extend along only one [[dimension]], with the material being essentially disordered in the other two directions.<ref name=b4>{{cite book|author=Dierking, I. |title=Textures of Liquid Crystals|location=Weinheim|date=2003|publisher=Wiley-VCH|isbn=978-3-527-30725-8|url=https://books.google.com/?id=p-0xdzDRB2kC&printsec=frontcover}}</ref><ref name=b5>{{cite book|author1=Collings, P.J.|author2=Hird, M.|lastauthoramp=yes|title=Introduction to Liquid Crystals|location=Bristol, PA|publisher=Taylor & Francis|date=1997|isbn=978-0-7484-0643-2|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/introductiontoli0000coll}}\n</ref>\n\n===Thermotropic liquid crystals===\n{{see also|Thermotropic crystal}}\nThermotropic phases are those that occur in a certain temperature range.

At too low temperature, most LC materials will form a conventional crystal.<ref name=b2/><ref name=b1/> Many thermotropic LCs exhibit a variety of phases as temperature is changed.

The word ''nematic'' comes from the [[Greek language|Greek]] {{lang|el|\u03bd\u03ae\u03bc\u03b1}} (''{{lang-el|nema}}''), which means \"thread\". This term originates from the thread-like [[topological defect]]s observed in nematics, which are formally called '[[disclination]]s'. Nematics also exhibit so-called \"hedgehog\" topological defects. In a nematic phase, the ''calamitic'' or rod-shaped organic molecules have no positional order, but they self-align to have long-range directional order with their long axes roughly parallel.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.csupomona.edu/~jarego/pubs/RD2_LC.pdf |title=Asymmetric synthesis of a highly soluble 'trimeric' analogue of the chiral nematic liquid crystal twist agent Merck S1011 |last=Rego |first=J.A. |last2=Harvey |first2=Jamie A.A. |last3=MacKinnon |first3=Andrew L. |last4=Gatdula |first4=Elysse |journal=Liquid Crystals |volume=37 |issue=1 |date=January 2010 |pages=37\u201343 |doi=10.1080/02678290903359291 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121008152304/http://www.csupomona.edu/~jarego/pubs/RD2_LC.pdf |archivedate=October 8, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Thus, the molecules are free to flow and their center of mass positions are randomly distributed as in a liquid, but still maintain their long-range directional order.

This phase is often called the [[Cholesteric liquid crystal|''cholesteric'']] phase because it was first observed for [[cholesterol]] derivatives. Only [[Chirality (chemistry)|chiral molecules]] can give rise to such a phase. This phase exhibits a twisting of the molecules perpendicular to the director, with the molecular axis parallel to the director. The finite twist angle between adjacent molecules is due to their asymmetric packing, which results in longer-range chiral order. In the smectic C* phase (an asterisk denotes a chiral phase), the molecules have positional ordering in a layered structure (as in the other smectic phases), with the molecules tilted by a finite angle with respect to the layer normal. The chirality induces a finite azimuthal twist from one layer to the next, producing a spiral twisting of the molecular axis along the layer normal.<ref name=b1/><ref name=b4/><ref name=b5/>\n\n[[File:Cholesterinisch.png|thumb|Chiral nematic phase; p refers to the chiral pitch (see text)]]\nThe ''chiral pitch'', p, refers to the distance over which the LC molecules undergo a full 360\u00b0 twist (but note that the structure of the chiral nematic phase repeats itself every half-pitch, since in this phase directors at 0\u00b0 and \u00b1180\u00b0 are equivalent). The pitch, p, typically changes when the temperature is altered or when other molecules are added to the LC host (an achiral LC host material will form a chiral phase if doped with a chiral material), allowing the pitch of a given material to be tuned accordingly.

Blue phases have a regular three-dimensional cubic structure of defects with [[Crystal structure|lattice]] periods of several hundred nanometers, and thus they exhibit selective [[Bragg's law|Bragg reflections]] in the wavelength range of visible light corresponding to the [[Cubic phase|cubic lattice]]. It was theoretically predicted in 1981 that these phases can possess icosahedral symmetry similar to [[quasicrystal]]s.<ref>\n{{cite journal\n| title = Lattice Textures in Cholesteric Liquid Crystals\n| author=Kleinert H.\n| author-link=Hagen Kleinert\n| author2=Maki K.\n| last-author-amp=yes\n| journal=Fortschritte der Physik\n| volume = 29\n| issue = 5\n| pages = 219\u2013259\n| date = 1981\n| doi = 10.1002/prop.19810290503\n| url = http://www.physik.fu-berlin.de/~kleinert/75/75.pdf|bibcode = 1981ForPh..29..219K\n}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|url=http://chemgroups.northwestern.edu/seideman/Publications/The%20liquid-crystalline%20blue%20phases.pdf|title=The liquid-crystalline blue phases|journal=Rep.

Many amphiphilic molecules show lyotropic liquid-crystalline phase sequences depending on the volume balances between the hydrophilic part and hydrophobic part. These structures are formed through the micro-phase segregation of two incompatible components on a nanometer scale. Soap is an everyday example of a lyotropic liquid crystal.\n\nThe content of water or other solvent molecules changes the self-assembled structures. At very low amphiphile concentration, the molecules will be dispersed randomly without any ordering. At slightly higher (but still low) concentration, amphiphilic molecules will spontaneously assemble into [[micelle]]s or [[vesicle (biology)|vesicles]]. This is done so as to 'hide' the hydrophobic tail of the amphiphile inside the micelle core, exposing a hydrophilic (water-soluble) surface to aqueous solution. These spherical objects do not order themselves in solution, however. At higher concentration, the assemblies will become ordered. A typical phase is a hexagonal columnar phase, where the amphiphiles form long cylinders (again with a hydrophilic surface) that arrange themselves into a roughly hexagonal lattice. This is called the middle soap phase. At still higher concentration, a lamellar phase (neat soap phase) may form, wherein extended sheets of amphiphiles are separated by thin layers of water. For some systems, a cubic (also called viscous isotropic) phase may exist between the hexagonal and lamellar phases, wherein spheres are formed that create a dense cubic lattice. These spheres may also be connected to one another, forming a bicontinuous cubic phase.\n\nThe objects created by amphiphiles are usually spherical (as in the case of micelles), but may also be disc-like (bicelles), rod-like, or biaxial (all three micelle axes are distinct). These anisotropic self-assembled nano-structures can then order themselves in much the same way as thermotropic liquid crystals do, forming large-scale versions of all the thermotropic phases (such as a nematic phase of rod-shaped micelles).\n\nFor some systems, at high concentrations, inverse phases are observed. That is, one may generate an inverse hexagonal columnar phase (columns of water encapsulated by amphiphiles) or an inverse micellar phase (a bulk liquid crystal sample with spherical water cavities).\n\nA generic progression of phases, going from low to high amphiphile concentration, is:\n* Discontinuous cubic phase ([[micellar cubic]] phase)\n* [[Hexagonal phase]] (hexagonal columnar phase) (middle phase)\n* [[Lamellar phase]]\n* Bicontinuous [[cubic phase]]\n* Reverse hexagonal columnar phase\n* Inverse cubic phase (Inverse micellar phase)\n\nEven within the same phases, their self-assembled structures are tunable by the concentration: for example, in lamellar phases, the layer distances increase with the solvent volume. Since lyotropic liquid crystals rely on a subtle balance of intermolecular interactions, it is more difficult to analyze their structures and properties than those of thermotropic liquid crystals.\n\nSimilar phases and characteristics can be observed in immiscible diblock [[copolymer]]s.\n\n===Metallotropic liquid crystals===\n\nLiquid crystal phases can also be based on low-melting inorganic phases like [[Zinc chloride|ZnCl<sub>2</sub>]] that have a structure formed of linked tetrahedra and easily form glasses. The addition of long chain soap-like molecules leads to a series of new phases that show a variety of liquid crystalline behavior both as a function of the inorganic-organic composition ratio and of temperature. This class of materials has been named metallotropic.<ref name=martin>{{cite journal| title =Metallotropic liquid crystals formed by surfactant templating of molten metal halides| doi=10.1038/nmat1610|journal=Nature Materials |volume =5|date =2006| pmid =16547520| issue =4|bibcode = 2006NatMa...5..271M| last1 =Martin| first1 =James D.| last2 =Keary| first2 =Cristin L.| last3 =Thornton| first3 =Todd A.| last4 =Novotnak| first4 =Mark P.| last5 =Knutson| first5 =Jeremey W.| last6 =Folmer| first6 =Jacob C.

As the isotropic phase would not significantly affect the polarization of the light, it would appear very dark, whereas the crystal and liquid crystal phases will both polarize the light in a uniform way, leading to brightness and color gradients. This method allows for the characterization of the particular phase, as the different phases are defined by their particular order, which must be observed. The second method, [[differential scanning calorimetry]] (DSC),<ref name=\"Tomczyk2017\" /> allows for more precise determination of phase transitions and transition enthalpies. In DSC, a small sample is heated in a way that generates a very precise change in temperature with respect to time. During phase transitions, the heat flow required to maintain this heating or cooling rate will change. These changes can be observed and attributed to various phase transitions, such as key liquid crystal transitions.\n\nLyotropic mesophases are analyzed in a similar fashion, though these experiments are somewhat more complex, as the concentration of mesogen is a key factor. These experiments are run at various concentrations of [[mesogen]] in order to analyze that impact.\n\n==Biological liquid crystals==\nLyotropic liquid-crystalline phases are abundant in living systems, the study of which is referred to as [[lipid polymorphism]]. Accordingly, lyotropic liquid crystals attract particular attention in the field of biomimetic chemistry. In particular, [[biological membrane]]s and [[cell membranes]] are a form of liquid crystal. Their constituent molecules (e.g. [[phospholipid]]s) are perpendicular to the membrane surface, yet the membrane is flexible. These lipids vary in shape (see page on [[lipid polymorphism]]). The constituent molecules can inter-mingle easily, but tend not to leave the membrane due to the high energy requirement of this process. Lipid molecules can flip from one side of the membrane to the other, this process being catalyzed by [[flippase]]s and floppases (depending on the direction of movement). These liquid crystal membrane phases can also host important proteins such as receptors freely \"floating\" inside, or partly outside, the membrane, e.g. CCT.\n\nMany other biological structures exhibit liquid-crystal behavior. For instance, the concentrated [[protein]] solution that is extruded by a spider to generate [[spider silk|silk]] is, in fact, a liquid crystal phase. The precise ordering of molecules in silk is critical to its renowned strength.

In the case of liquid crystals, anisotropy in all of these interactions further complicates analysis. There are a number of fairly simple theories, however, that can at least predict the general behavior of the phase transitions in liquid crystal systems.\n\n===Director===\n\nAs we already saw above, the nematic liquid crystals are composed of rod-like molecules with the long axes of neighboring molecules aligned approximately to one another. To describe this anisotropic structure, a dimensionless unit vector '''''n''''' called the ''director'', is introduced to represent the direction of preferred orientation of molecules in the neighborhood of any point. Because there is no physical polarity along the director axis, '''''n''''' and '''''-n''''' are fully equivalent.<ref name=b1/>\n\n===Order parameter===\n\n[[File:Nematic-Director.png|thumb|The ''local nematic director'', which is also the ''local optical axis'', is given by the spatial and temporal average of the long molecular axes]]\n\nThe description of liquid crystals involves an analysis of order. A second rank symmetric traceless tensor order parameter is used to describe the orientational order of a nematic liquid crystal, although a scalar order parameter is usually sufficient to describe uniaxial nematic liquid crystals. To make this quantitative, an orientational order parameter is usually defined based on the average of the second [[Legendre polynomial]]:\n\n:<math>S = \\langle P_2(\\cos \\theta) \\rangle = \\left \\langle \\frac{3 \\cos^2(\\theta) - 1}{2} \\right \\rangle</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\theta</math> is the angle between the liquid-crystal molecular axis and the ''local director'' (which is the 'preferred direction' in a volume element of a liquid crystal sample, also representing its ''[[optical axis|local optical axis]]''). The brackets denote both a temporal and spatial average. This definition is convenient, since for a completely random and isotropic sample, ''S''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0, whereas for a perfectly aligned sample S=1. For a typical liquid crystal sample, ''S'' is on the order of 0.3 to 0.8, and generally decreases as the temperature is raised. In particular, a sharp drop of the order parameter to 0 is observed when the system undergoes a phase transition from an LC phase into the isotropic phase.<ref>{{cite journal|title = A model for the orientational order in liquid crystals| doi =10.1007/BF02453342|journal=Il Nuovo Cimento D|volume = 4| issue =3|date =1984| page = 229|bibcode = 1984NCimD...4..229G|last1 = Ghosh|first1 = S. K. }}</ref> The order parameter can be measured experimentally in a number of ways; for instance, [[diamagnetism]], [[birefringence]], [[Raman scattering]], [[Nuclear magnetic resonance|NMR]] and [[Electron Paramagnetic Resonance|EPR]] can be used to determine S.<ref name=b5/>\n\nThe order of a liquid crystal could also be characterized by using other even Legendre polynomials (all the odd polynomials average to zero since the director can point in either of two antiparallel directions). These higher-order averages are more difficult to measure, but can yield additional information about molecular ordering.<ref name=b2/>\n\nA positional order parameter is also used to describe the ordering of a liquid crystal. It is characterized by the variation of the density of the center of mass of the liquid crystal molecules along a given vector. In the case of positional variation along the ''z''-axis the density <math>\\rho (z)</math> is often given by:\n\n:<math>\\rho (\\mathbf{r}) = \\rho (z) = \\rho_0 + \\rho_1\\cos(q_sz - \\varphi) + \\cdots \\, </math>\n\nThe complex positional order parameter is defined as <math>\\psi (\\mathbf{r}) = \\rho_1 (\\mathbf{r})e^{i\\varphi(\\mathbf{r})}</math> and <math>\\rho_0</math> the average density. Typically only the first two terms are kept and higher order terms are ignored since most phases can be described adequately using sinusoidal functions. For a perfect nematic <math>\\psi = 0</math> and for a smectic phase <math>\\psi</math> will take on complex values. The complex nature of this order parameter allows for many parallels between nematic to smectic phase transitions and conductor to superconductor transitions.<ref name=b1/>\n\n===Onsager hard-rod model===\n{{unsolved|physics|Can the nematic to smectic (A) phase transition in liquid crystal states be characterized as a [[background independence|universal]] phase transition?}}\nA simple model which predicts lyotropic phase transitions is the hard-rod model proposed by [[Lars Onsager]]. This theory considers the volume excluded from the center-of-mass of one idealized cylinder as it approaches another. Specifically, if the cylinders are oriented parallel to one another, there is very little volume that is excluded from the center-of-mass of the approaching cylinder (it can come quite close to the other cylinder). If, however, the cylinders are at some angle to one another, then there is a large volume surrounding the cylinder which the approaching cylinder's center-of-mass cannot enter (due to the hard-rod repulsion between the two idealized objects). Thus, this angular arrangement sees a ''decrease'' in the net positional [[entropy]] of the approaching cylinder (there are fewer states available to it).<ref>{{cite journal| journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences|volume = 51| issue =4|date = 1949| page = 627| doi =10.1111/j.1749-6632.1949.tb27296.x|title=The effects of shape on the interaction of colloidal particles|bibcode = 1949NYASA..51..627O| last1=Onsager| first1=Lars }}</ref><ref name=vroege>{{cite journal| title = Phase transitions in lyotropic colloidal and polymer liquid crystals| doi= 10.1088/0034-4885/55/8/003|journal=Rep.

This theory thus predicts that a solution of rod-shaped objects will undergo a phase transition, at sufficient concentration, into a nematic phase. Although this model is conceptually helpful, its mathematical formulation makes several assumptions that limit its applicability to real systems.<ref name=vroege/>\n\n===Maier\u2013Saupe mean field theory===\nThis statistical theory, proposed by [[Alfred Saupe]] and Wilhelm Maier, includes contributions from an attractive intermolecular potential from an induced dipole moment between adjacent rod-like liquid crystal molecules. The anisotropic attraction stabilizes parallel alignment of neighboring molecules, and the theory then considers a [[mean-field theory|mean-field]] average of the interaction. Solved self-consistently, this theory predicts thermotropic nematic-isotropic phase transitions, consistent with experiment.<ref>{{cite journal| author=Maier W. and Saupe A.| journal=Z. Naturforsch.

It predicts that the phase transition can be either continuous or discontinuous depending on the strength of the short-range interaction between the molecules. As a result, it allows for a triple critical point where the nematic, isotropic, and smectic A phase meet. Although it predicts the existence of a triple critical point, it does not successfully predict its value. The model utilizes two order parameters that describe the orientational and positional order of the liquid crystal. The first is simply the average of the second [[Legendre polynomials|Legendre polynomial]] and the second order parameter is given by:\n\n: <math>\\sigma = \\left\\langle\\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi z_i}{d}\\right)\\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\cos^2\\left(\\theta_i\\right) - \\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\right\\rangle</math>\n\nThe values ''z<sub>i</sub>, \u03b8<sub>i</sub>'', and ''d'' are the position of the molecule, the angle between the molecular axis and director, and the layer spacing. The postulated potential energy of a single molecule is given by:\n\n:<math>U_i(\\theta_i, z_i) = -U_0\\left(S + \\alpha\\sigma\\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi z_i}{d}\\right)\\right)\\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\cos^2\\left(\\theta_i\\right) - \\frac{1}{2}\\right)</math>\n\nHere constant \u03b1 quantifies the strength of the interaction between adjacent molecules. The potential is then used to derive the thermodynamic properties of the system assuming thermal equilibrium. It results in two self-consistency equations that must be solved numerically, the solutions of which are the three stable phases of the liquid crystal.<ref name=b5/>\n\n===Elastic continuum theory===\nIn this formalism, a liquid crystal material is treated as a continuum; molecular details are entirely ignored. Rather, this theory considers perturbations to a presumed oriented sample. The distortions of the liquid crystal are commonly described by the [[Frank free energy density]]. One can identify three types of distortions that could occur in an oriented sample: (1) '''twists''' of the material, where neighboring molecules are forced to be angled with respect to one another, rather than aligned; (2) '''splay''' of the material, where bending occurs perpendicular to the director; and (3) '''bend''' of the material, where the distortion is parallel to the director and molecular axis. All three of these types of distortions incur an energy penalty. They are distortions that are induced by the boundary conditions at domain walls or the enclosing container. The response of the material can then be decomposed into terms based on the elastic constants corresponding to the three types of distortions. Elastic continuum theory is a particularly powerful tool for modeling liquid crystal devices <ref>{{cite journal|title = Continuum theory for nematic liquid crystals| journal=Continuum Mechanics and Thermodynamics|volume = 4|date= 1992| issue =3| page = 167| doi =10.1007/BF01130288|bibcode = 1992CMT.....4..167L|last1 = Leslie|first1 = F.

Both electric and magnetic fields can be used to induce these changes. The magnitude of the fields, as well as the speed at which the molecules align are important characteristics industry deals with. Special surface treatments can be used in liquid crystal devices to force specific orientations of the director.\n\n===Electric and magnetic field effects===\nThe ability of the director to align along an external field is caused by the electric nature of the molecules. Permanent electric dipoles result when one end of a molecule has a net positive charge while the other end has a net negative charge. When an external electric field is applied to the liquid crystal, the dipole molecules tend to orient themselves along the direction of the field.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=2014|title=Historical Overview of Polar Liquid Crystals|journal=Ferroelectrics|volume=468|pages=1\u201317|doi=10.1080/00150193.2014.932653|last1=Takezoe|first1=Hideo}}</ref>\n\nEven if a molecule does not form a permanent dipole, it can still be influenced by an electric field. In some cases, the field produces slight re-arrangement of electrons and protons in molecules such that an induced electric dipole results. While not as strong as permanent dipoles, orientation with the external field still occurs.\n\nThe response of any system to an external electrical field is\n\n: <math>D_i = \\epsilon_0 E_i + P_i</math>\n\nwhere <math>E_i</math>, <math>D_i</math> and <math>P_i</math> are the components of the electric field, electric displacement field and polarization density. The electric energy per volume stored in the system is\n\n: <math>f_\\text{elec} = -\\frac{1}{2} D_i E_i</math>\n\n(summation over the doubly appearing index <math>i</math>). In nematic liquid crystals, the polarization, and electric displacement both depend linearly on the direction of the electric field. The polarization should be even in the director since liquid crystals are invariants under reflexions of <math>n</math>. The most general form to express <math>D</math> is\n\n: <math>D_i = \\epsilon_0 \\epsilon_\\bot E_i + \\left(\\epsilon_\\parallel - \\epsilon_\\bot\\right) n_i n_j E_j </math>\n\n(summation over the index <math>j</math>) with <math>\\epsilon_\\bot</math> and <math>\\epsilon_\\parallel</math> the electric [[permittivity]] parallel and perpendicular to the director <math>n</math>.

There are both <math>\\Delta\\epsilon > 0</math> and <math>\\Delta\\epsilon < 0</math> commercial liquid crystals. [[5CB]] and [[E7 liquid crystal mixture]] are two <math>\\Delta\\epsilon > 0</math> liquid crystals commonly used. [[MBBA]] is a common <math>\\Delta\\epsilon < 0</math> liquid crystal.\n\nThe effects of magnetic fields on liquid crystal molecules are analogous to electric fields. Because magnetic fields are generated by moving electric charges, permanent magnetic dipoles are produced by electrons moving about atoms. When a magnetic field is applied, the molecules will tend to align with or against the field. Electromagnetic radiation, e.g. UV-Visible light, can influence light-responsive liquid crystals which mainly carry at least a photo-switchable unit.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=2017|title=photoswitchable liquid crystal design|journal=Synthesis|volume=49|issue=6|pages=1214\u20131222|doi=10.1055/s-0036-1588913|last1=Kazem-Rostami|first1=Masoud}}</ref>\n\n===Surface preparations===\nIn the absence of an external field, the director of a liquid crystal is free to point in any direction. It is possible, however, to force the director to point in a specific direction by introducing an outside agent to the system. For example, when a thin polymer coating (usually a polyimide) is spread on a glass substrate and rubbed in a single direction with a cloth, it is observed that liquid crystal molecules in contact with that surface align with the rubbing direction. The currently accepted mechanism for this is believed to be an epitaxial growth of the liquid crystal layers on the partially aligned polymer chains in the near surface layers of the polyimide.\n\nSeveral liquid crystal chemicals also align to a 'command surface' which is in turn aligned by electric field of polarized light. This process is called [[photoalignment]].\n\n===[[Fr\u00e9edericksz transition|Fredericks transition]]===\nThe competition between orientation produced by surface anchoring and by electric field effects is often exploited in liquid crystal devices. Consider the case in which liquid crystal molecules are aligned parallel to the surface and an electric field is applied perpendicular to the cell. At first, as the electric field increases in magnitude, no change in alignment occurs. However at a threshold magnitude of electric field, deformation occurs. Deformation occurs where the director changes its orientation from one molecule to the next. The occurrence of such a change from an aligned to a deformed state is called a Fredericks transition and can also be produced by the application of a magnetic field of sufficient strength.\n\nThe Fredericks transition is fundamental to the operation of many liquid crystal displays because the director orientation (and thus the properties) can be controlled easily by the application of a field.\n\n==Effect of chirality==\nAs already described, [[chirality (chemistry)|chiral]] liquid-crystal molecules usually give rise to chiral mesophases. This means that the molecule must possess some form of asymmetry, usually a [[stereogenic]] center. An additional requirement is that the system not be [[racemic]]: a mixture of right- and left-handed molecules will cancel the chiral effect. Due to the cooperative nature of liquid crystal ordering, however, a small amount of chiral dopant in an otherwise achiral mesophase is often enough to select out one domain handedness, making the system overall chiral.\n\nChiral phases usually have a helical twisting of the molecules. If the pitch of this twist is on the order of the wavelength of visible light, then interesting optical interference effects can be observed. The chiral twisting that occurs in chiral LC phases also makes the system respond differently from right- and left-handed circularly polarized light. These materials can thus be used as [[polarizer|polarization filters]].<ref>{{cite journal| title = Video camera system using liquid-crystal polarizing filter toreduce reflected light| doi =10.1109/11.735903|journal=IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting|volume = 44| issue =4|date = 1998| page = 419| last1 = Fujikake| first1 = H.| last2 = Takizawa| first2 = K.| last3 = Aida| first3 = T.| last4 = Negishi| first4 = T.| last5 = Kobayashi| first5 = M.}}</ref>\n\nIt is possible for chiral LC molecules to produce essentially achiral mesophases. For instance, in certain ranges of concentration and [[molecular weight]], DNA will form an achiral line hexatic phase. An interesting recent observation is of the formation of chiral mesophases from achiral LC molecules. Specifically, bent-core molecules (sometimes called banana liquid crystals) have been shown to form liquid crystal phases that are chiral.<ref>{{cite journal|title = Switching of banana liquid crystal mesophases under field| doi =10.1140/epje/e2003-00016-y|journal=European Physical Journal E| volume = 10|date = 2003| pmid =15011066| issue =2|bibcode = 2003EPJE...10..129A|last1 = Achard|first1 = M.F.|last2 = Bedel|first2 = J.Ph.|last3 = Marcerou|first3 = J.P.|last4 = Nguyen|first4 = H.T.|last5 = Rouillon|first5 = J.C.|pages = 129\u201334 }}</ref> In any particular sample, various domains will have opposite handedness, but within any given domain, strong chiral ordering will be present. The appearance mechanism of this macroscopic chirality is not yet entirely clear. It appears that the molecules stack in layers and orient themselves in a tilted fashion inside the layers. These liquid crystals phases may be [[ferroelectric]] or anti-ferroelectric, both of which are of interest for applications.<ref>{{cite journal|title = Ferroelectric nematic liquid-crystal phases of dipolar hard ellipsoids|journal=Phys.

In a typical device, a liquid crystal layer (typically 4 \u03bcm thick) sits between two [[polarizer]]s that are crossed (oriented at 90\u00b0 to one another). The liquid crystal alignment is chosen so that its relaxed phase is a twisted one (see [[Twisted nematic field effect]]).<ref name=castellano/> This twisted phase reorients light that has passed through the first polarizer, allowing its transmission through the second polarizer (and reflected back to the observer if a reflector is provided). The device thus appears transparent. When an electric field is applied to the LC layer, the long molecular axes tend to align parallel to the electric field thus gradually untwisting in the center of the liquid crystal layer. In this state, the LC molecules do not reorient light, so the light polarized at the first polarizer is absorbed at the second polarizer, and the device loses transparency with increasing voltage. In this way, the electric field can be used to make a pixel switch between transparent or opaque on command. Color LCD systems use the same technique, with color filters used to generate red, green, and blue pixels.<ref name=castellano/> Chiral smectic liquid crystals are used in ferroelectric LCDs which are fast-switching binary light modulators. Similar principles can be used to make other liquid crystal based optical devices.<ref>{{cite journal|title = Integrating liquid crystal based optical devices in photonic crystal| doi = 10.1007/s11082-007-9139-8|journal=Optical and Quantum Electronics|volume = 39| issue =12\u201313|date =2007| page = 1009|last1 = Alkeskjold|first1 = Thomas Tanggaard|last2 = Scolari|first2 = Lara|last3 = Noordegraaf|first3 = Danny|last4 = L\u00e6gsgaard|first4 = Jesper|last5 = Weirich|first5 = Johannes|last6 = Wei|first6 = Lei|last7 = Tartarini|first7 = Giovanni|last8 = Bassi|first8 = Paolo|last9 = Gauza|first9 = Sebastian| last10 = Wu| first10 = Shin-Tson| last11 = Bjarklev| first11 = Anders}}</ref>\n\n[[Liquid crystal tunable filter]]s are used as [[electrooptical]] devices,<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=PKwlrW-CrxUC&pg=PA16|title=Piezoelectric Nanomaterials for Biomedical Applications|last=Ciofani|first=Gianni|last2=Menciassi|first2=Arianna|date=2012|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|isbn=9783642280443}}</ref> e.g., in [[hyperspectral imaging]].\n\n[[thermochromism|Thermotropic]] chiral LCs whose pitch varies strongly with temperature can be used as crude [[liquid crystal thermometer]]s, since the color of the material will change as the pitch is changed.

For instance, a liquid crystal may flow like a liquid, but its [[molecules]] may be oriented in a crystal-like way. There are many different types of liquid-crystal [[Phase (matter)|phases]], which can be distinguished by their different [[Optics|optical]] properties (such as [[Texture (crystalline)|textures]]). The contrasting areas in the textures correspond to domains where the liquid-crystal molecules are oriented in different directions. Within a domain, however, the molecules are well ordered. LC materials may not always be in a liquid-crystal state of matter (just as water may turn into ice or water vapor).\n\nLiquid crystals can be divided into [[thermotropic]], [[lyotropic]] and metallotropic phases. Thermotropic and lyotropic liquid crystals consist mostly of [[organic molecules]], although a few minerals are also known. Thermotropic LCs exhibit a [[phase transition]] into the liquid-crystal phase as temperature is changed. Lyotropic LCs exhibit phase transitions as a function of both temperature and [[concentration]] of the liquid-crystal molecules in a [[solvent]] (typically water). Metallotropic LCs are composed of both organic and inorganic molecules; their liquid-crystal transition depends not only on temperature and concentration, but also on the inorganic-organic composition ratio.\n\nExamples of liquid crystals can be found both in the natural world and in technological applications. Widespread [[Liquid-crystal display]]s use liquid crystals. Lyotropic liquid-crystalline phases are abundant in living systems but can also be found in the mineral world. For example, many proteins and cell membranes are liquid crystals. Other well-known examples of liquid crystals are solutions of [[soap]] and various related [[detergent]]s, as well as the [[tobacco mosaic virus]], and some [[clays]].\n\n==History==\nIn 1888, Austrian botanical physiologist [[Friedrich Reinitzer]], working at the [[Karl-Ferdinands-Universit\u00e4t]], examined the physico-chemical properties of various [[Derivative (chemistry)|derivatives]] of [[cholesterol]] which now belong to the class of materials known as cholesteric liquid crystals. Previously, other researchers had observed distinct color effects when cooling cholesterol derivatives just above the [[freezing point]], but had not associated it with a new phenomenon. Reinitzer perceived that color changes in a derivative [[cholesteryl benzoate]] were not the most peculiar feature.[[File:Cholesteryl benzoate.png|thumb|250 px|Chemical structure of [[cholesteryl benzoate]] molecule]] He found that cholesteryl benzoate does not [[melting|melt]] in the same manner as other compounds, but has two [[melting point]]s. At {{convert|145.5|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} it melts into a cloudy liquid, and at {{convert|178.5|\u00b0C|\u00b0F}} it melts again and the cloudy liquid becomes clear. The phenomenon is reversible. Seeking help from a physicist, on March 14, 1888, he wrote to [[Otto Lehmann (physicist)|Otto Lehmann]], at that time a ''{{lang|de|[[Privatdozent]]}}'' in [[Aachen]]. They exchanged letters and samples. Lehmann examined the intermediate cloudy fluid, and reported seeing [[crystallite]]s. Reinitzer's Viennese colleague von Zepharovich also indicated that the intermediate \"fluid\" was crystalline. The exchange of letters with Lehmann ended on April 24, with many questions unanswered. Reinitzer presented his results, with credits to Lehmann and von Zepharovich, at a meeting of the Vienna Chemical Society on May 3, 1888.<ref>{{cite journal| title = Beitr\u00e4ge zur Kenntniss des Cholesterins| journal=Monatshefte f\u00fcr Chemie| volume = 9| issue =1| pages = 421\u2013441|date =1888| doi =10.1007/BF01516710| last1 = Reinitzer| first1 = Friedrich}}</ref>\n\nBy that time, Reinitzer had discovered and described three important features of cholesteric liquid crystals (the name coined by Otto Lehmann in 1904): the existence of two melting points, the reflection of [[circular polarization|circularly polarized light]], and the ability to rotate the polarization direction of light.\n\nAfter his accidental discovery, Reinitzer did not pursue studying liquid crystals further. The research was continued by Lehmann, who realized that he had encountered a new phenomenon and was in a position to investigate it: In his postdoctoral years he had acquired expertise in crystallography and microscopy. Lehmann started a systematic study, first of cholesteryl benzoate, and then of related compounds which exhibited the double-melting phenomenon. He was able to make observations in polarized light, and his microscope was equipped with a hot stage (sample holder equipped with a heater) enabling high temperature observations. The intermediate cloudy phase clearly sustained flow, but other features, particularly the signature under a microscope, convinced Lehmann that he was dealing with a solid. By the end of August 1889 he had published his results in the [[Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Physikalische Chemie]].<ref>{{cite journal| author=Lehmann, O. |doi=10.1515/zpch-1889-0434| title = \u00dcber fliessende Krystalle| journal=Zeitschrift f\u00fcr Physikalische Chemie|volume =4| pages = 462\u201372|date =1889}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Otto Lehmann.jpg|thumb|180px|Otto Lehmann]]\nLehmann's work was continued and significantly expanded by the German chemist [[Daniel Vorl\u00e4nder]], who from the beginning of 20th century until his retirement in 1935, had synthesized most of the liquid crystals known. However, liquid crystals were not popular among scientists and the material remained a pure scientific curiosity for about 80 years.<ref name=b3/>\n\nAfter World War II work on the synthesis of liquid crystals was restarted at university research laboratories in Europe. [[George William Gray]], a prominent researcher of liquid crystals, began investigating these materials in England in the late 1940s. His group synthesized many new materials that exhibited the liquid crystalline state and developed a better understanding of how to design molecules that exhibit the state. His book ''Molecular Structure and the Properties of Liquid Crystals''<ref>Gray, G. W. (1962) ''Molecular Structure and the Properties of Liquid Crystals'', Academic Press</ref> became a guidebook on the subject. One of the first U.S. chemists to study liquid crystals was Glenn H. Brown, starting in 1953 at the [[University of Cincinnati]] and later at [[Kent State University]]. In 1965, he organized the first international conference on liquid crystals, in Kent, Ohio, with about 100 of the world's top liquid crystal scientists in attendance. This conference marked the beginning of a worldwide effort to perform research in this field, which soon led to the development of practical applications for these unique materials.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/13583149408628630|title=Professor Horst Sackmann, 1921 \u2013 1993|date=1994|last1=Stegemeyer|first1=H|journal=Liquid Crystals Today|volume=4|pages=1\u20132}}</ref><ref>[http://www1.kfupm.edu.sa/phys101/docs/Physics%20Success%20Stories%20-%20Physics%20On%20Display.htm Liquid Crystals] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.today/20120805230930/http://www1.kfupm.edu.sa/phys101/docs/Physics%20Success%20Stories%20-%20Physics%20On%20Display.htm |date=August 5, 2012 }}. kfupm.edu.sa</ref>\n\nLiquid crystal materials became a focus of research in the development of flat panel electronic displays beginning in 1962 at [[RCA]] Laboratories.<ref name=castellano/> When physical chemist Richard Williams applied an electric field to a thin layer of a [[#Nematic_phase|nematic]] liquid crystal at 125&nbsp;\u00b0C, he observed the formation of a regular pattern that he called domains (now known as Williams Domains). This led his colleague [[George H. Heilmeier]] to perform research on a liquid crystal-based flat panel display to replace the cathode ray vacuum tube used in televisions. But the [[para-Azoxyanisole]] that Williams and Heilmeier used exhibits the nematic liquid crystal state only above 116&nbsp;\u00b0C, which made it impractical to use in a commercial display product. A material that could be operated at room temperature was clearly needed.\n\nIn 1966, Joel E. Goldmacher and Joseph A. Castellano, research chemists in Heilmeier group at RCA, discovered that mixtures made exclusively of nematic compounds that differed only in the number of carbon atoms in the terminal side chains could yield room-temperature nematic liquid crystals. A ternary mixture of [[Schiff base]] compounds resulted in a material that had a nematic range of 22\u2013105&nbsp;\u00b0C.<ref>Goldmacher, Joel E. and Castellano, Joseph A. \"Electro-optical Compositions and Devices,\" {{US Patent|3540796}}, Issue date: November 17, 1970.</ref> Operation at room temperature enabled the first practical display device to be made.<ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1063/1.1652453|title=Dynamic Scattering in Nematic Liquid Crystals|date=1968|last1=Heilmeier|first1=G.

This technique of mixing nematic compounds to obtain wide [[operating temperature]] range eventually became the industry standard and is still used to tailor materials to meet specific applications.\n\n[[File:MBBA cleaner.svg|thumb|Chemical structure of [[MBBA|N-(4-Methoxybenzylidene)-4-butylaniline (MBBA)]] molecule]]\nIn 1969, Hans Kelker succeeded in synthesizing a substance that had a nematic phase at room temperature, [[MBBA]], which is one of the most popular subjects of liquid crystal research.<ref>{{cite journal| journal=Angew.

There are three types of thermotropic liquid crystals: discotic, conic (bowlic), and rod-shaped molecules. Discotics are flat disc-like molecules consisting of a core of adjacent aromatic rings; the core in a conic LC is not flat, but is shaped like a rice bowl (a three-dimensional object).<ref>Lam, Lui (1994). \"Bowlics\".

One can distinguish positional order (whether molecules are arranged in any sort of ordered lattice) and orientational order (whether molecules are mostly pointing in the same direction), and moreover order can be either short-range (only between molecules close to each other) or long-range (extending to larger, sometimes [[macroscopic scale|macroscopic]], dimensions). Most thermotropic LCs will have an [[isotropic]] phase at high temperature. That is that heating will eventually drive them into a conventional liquid phase characterized by random and isotropic molecular ordering (little to no long-range order), and [[fluid]]-like flow behavior. Under other conditions (for instance, lower temperature), a LC might inhabit one or more phases with significant  [[anisotropic]] orientational structure and short-range orientational order while still having an ability to flow.<ref name=b2>\n{{cite book|author=Chandrasekhar, S.|title=Liquid Crystals|edition = 2nd|location = Cambridge|publisher=Cambridge University Press|date=1992|isbn=978-0-521-41747-1|url=https://books.google.com/?id=TxvUxFlQsEsC&printsec=frontcover|author-link=Sivaramakrishna Chandrasekhar}}\n</ref><ref name=b1>\n{{cite book|author=[[Pierre-Gilles de Gennes|de Gennes, P.G.]] and Prost, J|title=The Physics of Liquid Crystals|location = Oxford|publisher=Clarendon Press|date=1993|isbn=978-0-19-852024-5}}\n</ref>\n\nThe ordering of liquid crystalline phases is extensive on the molecular scale. This order extends up to the entire domain size, which may be on the order of micrometers, but usually does not extend to the macroscopic scale as often occurs in classical [[crystal]]line solids.

This term originates from the thread-like [[topological defect]]s observed in nematics, which are formally called '[[disclination]]s'. Nematics also exhibit so-called \"hedgehog\" topological defects. In a nematic phase, the ''calamitic'' or rod-shaped organic molecules have no positional order, but they self-align to have long-range directional order with their long axes roughly parallel.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.csupomona.edu/~jarego/pubs/RD2_LC.pdf |title=Asymmetric synthesis of a highly soluble 'trimeric' analogue of the chiral nematic liquid crystal twist agent Merck S1011 |last=Rego |first=J.A. |last2=Harvey |first2=Jamie A.A. |last3=MacKinnon |first3=Andrew L. |last4=Gatdula |first4=Elysse |journal=Liquid Crystals |volume=37 |issue=1 |date=January 2010 |pages=37\u201343 |doi=10.1080/02678290903359291 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121008152304/http://www.csupomona.edu/~jarego/pubs/RD2_LC.pdf |archivedate=October 8, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Thus, the molecules are free to flow and their center of mass positions are randomly distributed as in a liquid, but still maintain their long-range directional order.

The chiral nematic phase (left), also called the cholesteric phase, and the smectic C* phase (right).]]\nThe [[Chirality (chemistry)|chiral]] [[nematic]] phase exhibits [[Chirality (chemistry)|chirality]] (handedness). This phase is often called the [[Cholesteric liquid crystal|''cholesteric'']] phase because it was first observed for [[cholesterol]] derivatives. Only [[Chirality (chemistry)|chiral molecules]] can give rise to such a phase. This phase exhibits a twisting of the molecules perpendicular to the director, with the molecular axis parallel to the director. The finite twist angle between adjacent molecules is due to their asymmetric packing, which results in longer-range chiral order. In the smectic C* phase (an asterisk denotes a chiral phase), the molecules have positional ordering in a layered structure (as in the other smectic phases), with the molecules tilted by a finite angle with respect to the layer normal. The chirality induces a finite azimuthal twist from one layer to the next, producing a spiral twisting of the molecular axis along the layer normal.<ref name=b1/><ref name=b4/><ref name=b5/>\n\n[[File:Cholesterinisch.png|thumb|Chiral nematic phase; p refers to the chiral pitch (see text)]]\nThe ''chiral pitch'', p, refers to the distance over which the LC molecules undergo a full 360\u00b0 twist (but note that the structure of the chiral nematic phase repeats itself every half-pitch, since in this phase directors at 0\u00b0 and \u00b1180\u00b0 are equivalent). The pitch, p, typically changes when the temperature is altered or when other molecules are added to the LC host (an achiral LC host material will form a chiral phase if doped with a chiral material), allowing the pitch of a given material to be tuned accordingly. In some liquid crystal systems, the pitch is of the same order as the [[wavelength]] of [[visible light]].

Many amphiphilic molecules show lyotropic liquid-crystalline phase sequences depending on the volume balances between the hydrophilic part and hydrophobic part. These structures are formed through the micro-phase segregation of two incompatible components on a nanometer scale. Soap is an everyday example of a lyotropic liquid crystal.\n\nThe content of water or other solvent molecules changes the self-assembled structures. At very low amphiphile concentration, the molecules will be dispersed randomly without any ordering. At slightly higher (but still low) concentration, amphiphilic molecules will spontaneously assemble into [[micelle]]s or [[vesicle (biology)|vesicles]]. This is done so as to 'hide' the hydrophobic tail of the amphiphile inside the micelle core, exposing a hydrophilic (water-soluble) surface to aqueous solution. These spherical objects do not order themselves in solution, however. At higher concentration, the assemblies will become ordered. A typical phase is a hexagonal columnar phase, where the amphiphiles form long cylinders (again with a hydrophilic surface) that arrange themselves into a roughly hexagonal lattice. This is called the middle soap phase. At still higher concentration, a lamellar phase (neat soap phase) may form, wherein extended sheets of amphiphiles are separated by thin layers of water. For some systems, a cubic (also called viscous isotropic) phase may exist between the hexagonal and lamellar phases, wherein spheres are formed that create a dense cubic lattice. These spheres may also be connected to one another, forming a bicontinuous cubic phase.\n\nThe objects created by amphiphiles are usually spherical (as in the case of micelles), but may also be disc-like (bicelles), rod-like, or biaxial (all three micelle axes are distinct). These anisotropic self-assembled nano-structures can then order themselves in much the same way as thermotropic liquid crystals do, forming large-scale versions of all the thermotropic phases (such as a nematic phase of rod-shaped micelles).\n\nFor some systems, at high concentrations, inverse phases are observed. That is, one may generate an inverse hexagonal columnar phase (columns of water encapsulated by amphiphiles) or an inverse micellar phase (a bulk liquid crystal sample with spherical water cavities).\n\nA generic progression of phases, going from low to high amphiphile concentration, is:\n* Discontinuous cubic phase ([[micellar cubic]] phase)\n* [[Hexagonal phase]] (hexagonal columnar phase) (middle phase)\n* [[Lamellar phase]]\n* Bicontinuous [[cubic phase]]\n* Reverse hexagonal columnar phase\n* Inverse cubic phase (Inverse micellar phase)\n\nEven within the same phases, their self-assembled structures are tunable by the concentration: for example, in lamellar phases, the layer distances increase with the solvent volume. Since lyotropic liquid crystals rely on a subtle balance of intermolecular interactions, it is more difficult to analyze their structures and properties than those of thermotropic liquid crystals.\n\nSimilar phases and characteristics can be observed in immiscible diblock [[copolymer]]s.\n\n===Metallotropic liquid crystals===\n\nLiquid crystal phases can also be based on low-melting inorganic phases like [[Zinc chloride|ZnCl<sub>2</sub>]] that have a structure formed of linked tetrahedra and easily form glasses. The addition of long chain soap-like molecules leads to a series of new phases that show a variety of liquid crystalline behavior both as a function of the inorganic-organic composition ratio and of temperature.

As the isotropic phase would not significantly affect the polarization of the light, it would appear very dark, whereas the crystal and liquid crystal phases will both polarize the light in a uniform way, leading to brightness and color gradients. This method allows for the characterization of the particular phase, as the different phases are defined by their particular order, which must be observed. The second method, [[differential scanning calorimetry]] (DSC),<ref name=\"Tomczyk2017\" /> allows for more precise determination of phase transitions and transition enthalpies. In DSC, a small sample is heated in a way that generates a very precise change in temperature with respect to time. During phase transitions, the heat flow required to maintain this heating or cooling rate will change. These changes can be observed and attributed to various phase transitions, such as key liquid crystal transitions.\n\nLyotropic mesophases are analyzed in a similar fashion, though these experiments are somewhat more complex, as the concentration of mesogen is a key factor. These experiments are run at various concentrations of [[mesogen]] in order to analyze that impact.\n\n==Biological liquid crystals==\nLyotropic liquid-crystalline phases are abundant in living systems, the study of which is referred to as [[lipid polymorphism]]. Accordingly, lyotropic liquid crystals attract particular attention in the field of biomimetic chemistry. In particular, [[biological membrane]]s and [[cell membranes]] are a form of liquid crystal. Their constituent molecules (e.g. [[phospholipid]]s) are perpendicular to the membrane surface, yet the membrane is flexible. These lipids vary in shape (see page on [[lipid polymorphism]]). The constituent molecules can inter-mingle easily, but tend not to leave the membrane due to the high energy requirement of this process. Lipid molecules can flip from one side of the membrane to the other, this process being catalyzed by [[flippase]]s and floppases (depending on the direction of movement). These liquid crystal membrane phases can also host important proteins such as receptors freely \"floating\" inside, or partly outside, the membrane, e.g. CCT.\n\nMany other biological structures exhibit liquid-crystal behavior. For instance, the concentrated [[protein]] solution that is extruded by a spider to generate [[spider silk|silk]] is, in fact, a liquid crystal phase. The precise ordering of molecules in silk is critical to its renowned strength.

There are a number of fairly simple theories, however, that can at least predict the general behavior of the phase transitions in liquid crystal systems.\n\n===Director===\n\nAs we already saw above, the nematic liquid crystals are composed of rod-like molecules with the long axes of neighboring molecules aligned approximately to one another. To describe this anisotropic structure, a dimensionless unit vector '''''n''''' called the ''director'', is introduced to represent the direction of preferred orientation of molecules in the neighborhood of any point. Because there is no physical polarity along the director axis, '''''n''''' and '''''-n''''' are fully equivalent.<ref name=b1/>\n\n===Order parameter===\n\n[[File:Nematic-Director.png|thumb|The ''local nematic director'', which is also the ''local optical axis'', is given by the spatial and temporal average of the long molecular axes]]\n\nThe description of liquid crystals involves an analysis of order. A second rank symmetric traceless tensor order parameter is used to describe the orientational order of a nematic liquid crystal, although a scalar order parameter is usually sufficient to describe uniaxial nematic liquid crystals. To make this quantitative, an orientational order parameter is usually defined based on the average of the second [[Legendre polynomial]]:\n\n:<math>S = \\langle P_2(\\cos \\theta) \\rangle = \\left \\langle \\frac{3 \\cos^2(\\theta) - 1}{2} \\right \\rangle</math>\n\nwhere <math>\\theta</math> is the angle between the liquid-crystal molecular axis and the ''local director'' (which is the 'preferred direction' in a volume element of a liquid crystal sample, also representing its ''[[optical axis|local optical axis]]''). The brackets denote both a temporal and spatial average. This definition is convenient, since for a completely random and isotropic sample, ''S''&nbsp;=&nbsp;0, whereas for a perfectly aligned sample S=1. For a typical liquid crystal sample, ''S'' is on the order of 0.3 to 0.8, and generally decreases as the temperature is raised. In particular, a sharp drop of the order parameter to 0 is observed when the system undergoes a phase transition from an LC phase into the isotropic phase.<ref>{{cite journal|title = A model for the orientational order in liquid crystals| doi =10.1007/BF02453342|journal=Il Nuovo Cimento D|volume = 4| issue =3|date =1984| page = 229|bibcode = 1984NCimD...4..229G|last1 = Ghosh|first1 = S. K. }}</ref> The order parameter can be measured experimentally in a number of ways; for instance, [[diamagnetism]], [[birefringence]], [[Raman scattering]], [[Nuclear magnetic resonance|NMR]] and [[Electron Paramagnetic Resonance|EPR]] can be used to determine S.<ref name=b5/>\n\nThe order of a liquid crystal could also be characterized by using other even Legendre polynomials (all the odd polynomials average to zero since the director can point in either of two antiparallel directions). These higher-order averages are more difficult to measure, but can yield additional information about molecular ordering.<ref name=b2/>\n\nA positional order parameter is also used to describe the ordering of a liquid crystal. It is characterized by the variation of the density of the center of mass of the liquid crystal molecules along a given vector. In the case of positional variation along the ''z''-axis the density <math>\\rho (z)</math> is often given by:\n\n:<math>\\rho (\\mathbf{r}) = \\rho (z) = \\rho_0 + \\rho_1\\cos(q_sz - \\varphi) + \\cdots \\, </math>\n\nThe complex positional order parameter is defined as <math>\\psi (\\mathbf{r}) = \\rho_1 (\\mathbf{r})e^{i\\varphi(\\mathbf{r})}</math> and <math>\\rho_0</math> the average density. Typically only the first two terms are kept and higher order terms are ignored since most phases can be described adequately using sinusoidal functions. For a perfect nematic <math>\\psi = 0</math> and for a smectic phase <math>\\psi</math> will take on complex values. The complex nature of this order parameter allows for many parallels between nematic to smectic phase transitions and conductor to superconductor transitions.<ref name=b1/>\n\n===Onsager hard-rod model===\n{{unsolved|physics|Can the nematic to smectic (A) phase transition in liquid crystal states be characterized as a [[background independence|universal]] phase transition?}}\nA simple model which predicts lyotropic phase transitions is the hard-rod model proposed by [[Lars Onsager]]. This theory considers the volume excluded from the center-of-mass of one idealized cylinder as it approaches another. Specifically, if the cylinders are oriented parallel to one another, there is very little volume that is excluded from the center-of-mass of the approaching cylinder (it can come quite close to the other cylinder). If, however, the cylinders are at some angle to one another, then there is a large volume surrounding the cylinder which the approaching cylinder's center-of-mass cannot enter (due to the hard-rod repulsion between the two idealized objects). Thus, this angular arrangement sees a ''decrease'' in the net positional [[entropy]] of the approaching cylinder (there are fewer states available to it).<ref>{{cite journal| journal=Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences|volume = 51| issue =4|date = 1949| page = 627| doi =10.1111/j.1749-6632.1949.tb27296.x|title=The effects of shape on the interaction of colloidal particles|bibcode = 1949NYASA..51..627O| last1=Onsager| first1=Lars }}</ref><ref name=vroege>{{cite journal| title = Phase transitions in lyotropic colloidal and polymer liquid crystals| doi= 10.1088/0034-4885/55/8/003|journal=Rep.

Thus in some case greater positional order will be entropically favorable. This theory thus predicts that a solution of rod-shaped objects will undergo a phase transition, at sufficient concentration, into a nematic phase. Although this model is conceptually helpful, its mathematical formulation makes several assumptions that limit its applicability to real systems.<ref name=vroege/>\n\n===Maier\u2013Saupe mean field theory===\nThis statistical theory, proposed by [[Alfred Saupe]] and Wilhelm Maier, includes contributions from an attractive intermolecular potential from an induced dipole moment between adjacent rod-like liquid crystal molecules. The anisotropic attraction stabilizes parallel alignment of neighboring molecules, and the theory then considers a [[mean-field theory|mean-field]] average of the interaction. Solved self-consistently, this theory predicts thermotropic nematic-isotropic phase transitions, consistent with experiment.<ref>{{cite journal| author=Maier W. and Saupe A.| journal=Z. Naturforsch.

It predicts that the phase transition can be either continuous or discontinuous depending on the strength of the short-range interaction between the molecules. As a result, it allows for a triple critical point where the nematic, isotropic, and smectic A phase meet. Although it predicts the existence of a triple critical point, it does not successfully predict its value. The model utilizes two order parameters that describe the orientational and positional order of the liquid crystal. The first is simply the average of the second [[Legendre polynomials|Legendre polynomial]] and the second order parameter is given by:\n\n: <math>\\sigma = \\left\\langle\\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi z_i}{d}\\right)\\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\cos^2\\left(\\theta_i\\right) - \\frac{1}{2}\\right)\\right\\rangle</math>\n\nThe values ''z<sub>i</sub>, \u03b8<sub>i</sub>'', and ''d'' are the position of the molecule, the angle between the molecular axis and director, and the layer spacing. The postulated potential energy of a single molecule is given by:\n\n:<math>U_i(\\theta_i, z_i) = -U_0\\left(S + \\alpha\\sigma\\cos\\left(\\frac{2\\pi z_i}{d}\\right)\\right)\\left(\\frac{3}{2}\\cos^2\\left(\\theta_i\\right) - \\frac{1}{2}\\right)</math>\n\nHere constant \u03b1 quantifies the strength of the interaction between adjacent molecules. The potential is then used to derive the thermodynamic properties of the system assuming thermal equilibrium. It results in two self-consistency equations that must be solved numerically, the solutions of which are the three stable phases of the liquid crystal.<ref name=b5/>\n\n===Elastic continuum theory===\nIn this formalism, a liquid crystal material is treated as a continuum; molecular details are entirely ignored. Rather, this theory considers perturbations to a presumed oriented sample. The distortions of the liquid crystal are commonly described by the [[Frank free energy density]]. One can identify three types of distortions that could occur in an oriented sample: (1) '''twists''' of the material, where neighboring molecules are forced to be angled with respect to one another, rather than aligned; (2) '''splay''' of the material, where bending occurs perpendicular to the director; and (3) '''bend''' of the material, where the distortion is parallel to the director and molecular axis. All three of these types of distortions incur an energy penalty. They are distortions that are induced by the boundary conditions at domain walls or the enclosing container. The response of the material can then be decomposed into terms based on the elastic constants corresponding to the three types of distortions. Elastic continuum theory is a particularly powerful tool for modeling liquid crystal devices <ref>{{cite journal|title = Continuum theory for nematic liquid crystals| journal=Continuum Mechanics and Thermodynamics|volume = 4|date= 1992| issue =3| page = 167| doi =10.1007/BF01130288|bibcode = 1992CMT.....4..167L|last1 = Leslie|first1 = F.

Both electric and magnetic fields can be used to induce these changes. The magnitude of the fields, as well as the speed at which the molecules align are important characteristics industry deals with. Special surface treatments can be used in liquid crystal devices to force specific orientations of the director.\n\n===Electric and magnetic field effects===\nThe ability of the director to align along an external field is caused by the electric nature of the molecules. Permanent electric dipoles result when one end of a molecule has a net positive charge while the other end has a net negative charge. When an external electric field is applied to the liquid crystal, the dipole molecules tend to orient themselves along the direction of the field.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=2014|title=Historical Overview of Polar Liquid Crystals|journal=Ferroelectrics|volume=468|pages=1\u201317|doi=10.1080/00150193.2014.932653|last1=Takezoe|first1=Hideo}}</ref>\n\nEven if a molecule does not form a permanent dipole, it can still be influenced by an electric field. In some cases, the field produces slight re-arrangement of electrons and protons in molecules such that an induced electric dipole results. While not as strong as permanent dipoles, orientation with the external field still occurs.\n\nThe response of any system to an external electrical field is\n\n: <math>D_i = \\epsilon_0 E_i + P_i</math>\n\nwhere <math>E_i</math>, <math>D_i</math> and <math>P_i</math> are the components of the electric field, electric displacement field and polarization density.

In nematic liquid crystals, the polarization, and electric displacement both depend linearly on the direction of the electric field. The polarization should be even in the director since liquid crystals are invariants under reflexions of <math>n</math>. The most general form to express <math>D</math> is\n\n: <math>D_i = \\epsilon_0 \\epsilon_\\bot E_i + \\left(\\epsilon_\\parallel - \\epsilon_\\bot\\right) n_i n_j E_j </math>\n\n(summation over the index <math>j</math>) with <math>\\epsilon_\\bot</math> and <math>\\epsilon_\\parallel</math> the electric [[permittivity]] parallel and perpendicular to the director <math>n</math>.

[[MBBA]] is a common <math>\\Delta\\epsilon < 0</math> liquid crystal.\n\nThe effects of magnetic fields on liquid crystal molecules are analogous to electric fields. Because magnetic fields are generated by moving electric charges, permanent magnetic dipoles are produced by electrons moving about atoms. When a magnetic field is applied, the molecules will tend to align with or against the field. Electromagnetic radiation, e.g. UV-Visible light, can influence light-responsive liquid crystals which mainly carry at least a photo-switchable unit.<ref>{{Cite journal|date=2017|title=photoswitchable liquid crystal design|journal=Synthesis|volume=49|issue=6|pages=1214\u20131222|doi=10.1055/s-0036-1588913|last1=Kazem-Rostami|first1=Masoud}}</ref>\n\n===Surface preparations===\nIn the absence of an external field, the director of a liquid crystal is free to point in any direction. It is possible, however, to force the director to point in a specific direction by introducing an outside agent to the system. For example, when a thin polymer coating (usually a polyimide) is spread on a glass substrate and rubbed in a single direction with a cloth, it is observed that liquid crystal molecules in contact with that surface align with the rubbing direction. The currently accepted mechanism for this is believed to be an epitaxial growth of the liquid crystal layers on the partially aligned polymer chains in the near surface layers of the polyimide.\n\nSeveral liquid crystal chemicals also align to a 'command surface' which is in turn aligned by electric field of polarized light. This process is called [[photoalignment]].\n\n===[[Fr\u00e9edericksz transition|Fredericks transition]]===\nThe competition between orientation produced by surface anchoring and by electric field effects is often exploited in liquid crystal devices. Consider the case in which liquid crystal molecules are aligned parallel to the surface and an electric field is applied perpendicular to the cell. At first, as the electric field increases in magnitude, no change in alignment occurs. However at a threshold magnitude of electric field, deformation occurs. Deformation occurs where the director changes its orientation from one molecule to the next. The occurrence of such a change from an aligned to a deformed state is called a Fredericks transition and can also be produced by the application of a magnetic field of sufficient strength.\n\nThe Fredericks transition is fundamental to the operation of many liquid crystal displays because the director orientation (and thus the properties) can be controlled easily by the application of a field.\n\n==Effect of chirality==\nAs already described, [[chirality (chemistry)|chiral]] liquid-crystal molecules usually give rise to chiral mesophases. This means that the molecule must possess some form of asymmetry, usually a [[stereogenic]] center. An additional requirement is that the system not be [[racemic]]: a mixture of right- and left-handed molecules will cancel the chiral effect. Due to the cooperative nature of liquid crystal ordering, however, a small amount of chiral dopant in an otherwise achiral mesophase is often enough to select out one domain handedness, making the system overall chiral.\n\nChiral phases usually have a helical twisting of the molecules. If the pitch of this twist is on the order of the wavelength of visible light, then interesting optical interference effects can be observed. The chiral twisting that occurs in chiral LC phases also makes the system respond differently from right- and left-handed circularly polarized light. These materials can thus be used as [[polarizer|polarization filters]].<ref>{{cite journal| title = Video camera system using liquid-crystal polarizing filter toreduce reflected light| doi =10.1109/11.735903|journal=IEEE Transactions on Broadcasting|volume = 44| issue =4|date = 1998| page = 419| last1 = Fujikake| first1 = H.| last2 = Takizawa| first2 = K.| last3 = Aida| first3 = T.| last4 = Negishi| first4 = T.| last5 = Kobayashi| first5 = M.}}</ref>\n\nIt is possible for chiral LC molecules to produce essentially achiral mesophases. For instance, in certain ranges of concentration and [[molecular weight]], DNA will form an achiral line hexatic phase. An interesting recent observation is of the formation of chiral mesophases from achiral LC molecules. Specifically, bent-core molecules (sometimes called banana liquid crystals) have been shown to form liquid crystal phases that are chiral.<ref>{{cite journal|title = Switching of banana liquid crystal mesophases under field| doi =10.1140/epje/e2003-00016-y|journal=European Physical Journal E| volume = 10|date = 2003| pmid =15011066| issue =2|bibcode = 2003EPJE...10..129A|last1 = Achard|first1 = M.F.|last2 = Bedel|first2 = J.Ph.|last3 = Marcerou|first3 = J.P.|last4 = Nguyen|first4 = H.T.|last5 = Rouillon|first5 = J.C.|pages = 129\u201334 }}</ref> In any particular sample, various domains will have opposite handedness, but within any given domain, strong chiral ordering will be present.

In a typical device, a liquid crystal layer (typically 4 \u03bcm thick) sits between two [[polarizer]]s that are crossed (oriented at 90\u00b0 to one another). The liquid crystal alignment is chosen so that its relaxed phase is a twisted one (see [[Twisted nematic field effect]]).<ref name=castellano/> This twisted phase reorients light that has passed through the first polarizer, allowing its transmission through the second polarizer (and reflected back to the observer if a reflector is provided). The device thus appears transparent. When an electric field is applied to the LC layer, the long molecular axes tend to align parallel to the electric field thus gradually untwisting in the center of the liquid crystal layer. In this state, the LC molecules do not reorient light, so the light polarized at the first polarizer is absorbed at the second polarizer, and the device loses transparency with increasing voltage. In this way, the electric field can be used to make a pixel switch between transparent or opaque on command. Color LCD systems use the same technique, with color filters used to generate red, green, and blue pixels.<ref name=castellano/> Chiral smectic liquid crystals are used in ferroelectric LCDs which are fast-switching binary light modulators.

They were located north-east of Mecca and their territory sat beside the trade route to [[Al-Hirah]] in [[Iraq]]. The Hawazins were allied with the Thaqifs, a Hawazin subtribe which had settled in Ta\u2019if, a town south-east of Mecca whose trade routes ran through Hawazin territory. The alliance had engaged in several wars probably concerning trade routes between Ta'if and Mecca. Given this history they saw Muhammad as another powerful Quraishi leader who had come to lead his people. They thought among themselves that a war with Muslims was imminent and that the once-persecuted minority of Muslims had gained the upper hand against their non-Muslim Arab enemies, and they may have wanted to take advantage of the likely chaos in Mecca after the Muslim takeover. Some tribes favoured fighting him and the Muslims. Ahead of these were the tribes of Hawazin and Thaqif. According to the Muslim scholar [[Safiur Rahman Mubarakpuri]] \"They thought that they were too mighty to admit or surrender to such a victory\". So, they met Malik bin \u2018Awf An-Nasri and made up their minds to proceed fighting against the Muslims. Malik persuaded other tribes to fight and gathered them before him. The confederation of tribes consisting of Nasr, [[Banu Jusham|Jusham]], [[Banu Sa'ad|Sa\u2018ad bin Bakr]], [[Bani Hilal]], Bani 'Amr bin Amir and Bani 'Awf bin Amir gathered at [[Autas]] along with the Thaqif and Hawazin.<ref>{{cite web|URL=https://books.google.com/books?id=xJL6gxPUV4EC&pg=PA259&dq=battle+of+hunayn&hl=en&sa=X&ei=Msv6VMmLBY2jugTb94CAAg&ved=0CCIQ6AEwAQ|title=When The Moon Split|date=1 July 1998|publisher=Darussalam|via=Google Books}}</ref><ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=-ppPqzawIrIC&pg=PA258 The sealed nectar], By S.R.

When we faced the enemy, the Muslims retreated and I saw a pagan throwing himself over a Muslim. I turned around and came upon him from behind and hit him on the shoulder with the sword He (i.e. the pagan) came towards me and seized me so violently that I felt as if it were death itself, but death overtook him and he released me. I followed 'Umar bin Al Khattab and asked (him), \"What is wrong with the people (fleeing)?\" He replied, \"This is the Will of Allah,\" After the people returned, the Prophet sat and said, \"Anyone who has killed an enemy and has a proof of that, will possess his spoils.\" I got up and said, \"Who will be a witness for me?\" and then sat down. The Prophet again said, \"Anyone who has killed an enemy and has proof of that, will possess his spoils.\" I (again) got up and said, \"Who will be a witness for me?\" and sat down. Then the Prophet said the same for the third time. I again got up, and Allah's Apostle said, \"O Abu Qatada! What is your story?\" Then I narrated the whole story to him. A man (got up and) said, \"O Allah's Apostle! He is speaking the truth, and the spoils of the killed man are with me. So please compensate him on my behalf.\" On that Abu Bakr As-Siddiq said, \"No, by Allah, he (i.e. Allah's Apostle ) will not agree to give you the spoils gained by one of Allah's Lions who fights on the behalf of Allah and His Apostle.\" The Prophet said, \"Abu Bakr has spoken the truth.\" So, Allah's Apostle gave the spoils to me. I sold that armor (i.e. the spoils) and with its price I bought a garden at Bani Salima, and this was my first property which I gained after my conversion to Islam.\n{{Hadith-usc|Bukhari|4|53|370}} }}\nThe event is also in Imam Maliks [[Muwatta Imam Malik|Al-Muwatta]] as follows: \n{{cquote|bgcolor=#F0FFF0|\nYahya related to me from Malik from Ibn Shihab that al-Qasim ibn Muhammad said that he had heard a man asking ibn Abbas about booty. Ibn Abbas said, \"Horses are part of the booty and personal effects are as well.\"\nThen the man repeated his question, and Ibn Abbas repeated his answer. Then the man said, \"What are the spoils which He, the Blessed, the Exalted, mentioned in His Book?\" He kept on asking until Ibn Abbas was on the verge of being annoyed, then Ibn Abbas said, \"Do you know who this man is like? Ibn Sabigh, who was beaten by Umar ibn al-Khattab because he was notorious for asking foolish questions.\"\nYahya said that Malik was asked whether someone who killed one of the enemy could keep the man's effects without the permission of the Imam. He said, \"No one can do that without the permission of the Imam. Only the Imam can make ijtihad. I have not heard that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, ever said, 'Whoever kills someone can have his effects,' on any other day than the day of Hunayn.\"\n{{Hadith-usc|muwatta|usc=yes|21|10|19|}} }}\n\n==See also==\n{{Wikipedia books\n |1=Military career of Muhammad\n}}\n*[[Muhammad as a warrior]]\n*[[List of expeditions of Muhammad]]\n\n==References==\n<References/>\n\n==External links==\n{{commonscatinline}}\n*[http://islamweb.net/ver2/archive/article.php?lang=E&id=40434 islamweb.net]\n*[http://islamanswers.net/moreAbout/Hunayn.htm islamanswers.net]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20051112012351/http://www.hizb-ut-tahrir.org/english/books/state/chapter_27.html ''The Battle Of Hunayn'']\n\n{{Characters and names in the Quran}}\n{{coord|22.9733|38.8197|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:Battles of Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah|Hunayn]]\n[[Category:Campaigns led by Muhammad]]\n[[Category:Battles of Khalid ibn Walid|Hunayn]]\n[[Category:630s conflicts|Hunayn]]\n[[Category:630]]\n[[Category:Qays]]\n", "text_old": "{{other uses2|Hunayn}}\n{{multiple issues|\n{{one source|date=December 2013}}\n{{more footnotes|date=December 2013}}\n{{primary sources|date=March 2016}}\n}}\n\n:''This is a sub-article to [[Muhammad after the conquest of Mecca]].\n{{Infobox military conflict\n| conflict          = Battle of Hunayn\n| partof            = \n| image             = Balami - Tarikhnama - The Battle of Hunayn - The Prophet's life is threatened.jpg\n| caption           = Folio from the ''[[Tarikhnama]]'' by [[Muhammad Bal'ami]] with the Battle of Hunayn\n| date              = 630 (8 AH)\n| place             = [[Hunayn (Saudi Arabia)|Hunain]], near [[Ta'if|al-Ta'if]] in south-western [[Arabian Peninsula|Arabia]]\n| result            = Decisive Muslim victory\n| combatant1        = [[Muslim]]s,<br>[[Quraysh (tribe)|Quraysh]]\n| combatant2        = [[Hawazin]],<br>[[Thaqif]], <br>[[Qais]]<br>Nasr,<br>[[Banu Jusham|Jusham]],<br>[[Banu Sa'ad|Sa\u2018d bin Bakr]],<br>[[Bani Hilal]],<br>Bani 'Amr bin Amir,<br>Bani 'Awf bin Amir\n| commander1        = '''[[Muhammad]]''' <br>[[Ali ibn Abi Talib]]<br>[[Abu Bakr]]<br>[[Umar ibn al-Khattab]]<br>[[Uthman ibn Affan]]<br>[[Al-Abbas ibn Abd al-Muttalib]]<br>[[Khalid ibn al-Walid]]<br>[[Zubayr ibn al-Awam]]\n| commander2        = <span style=color:blue>'''Malik ibn Awf al-Nasri''' </span>\n| strength1         = 12,000\n| strength2         = 20,000\n| casualties1       = 4 killed\n| casualties2       = 70 killed<ref name=\"PqzawIrIC Pg259\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-ppPqzawIrIC&pg=PA259|title=The Sealed Nectar|publisher=|accessdate=17 December 2014}}</ref><br>6,000 captured<ref name=\"books.google.co.uk\"/><br>{{bigger|Captures as Booty}}<br>24,000 camels<ref name=\"books.google.co.uk\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Feo9AAAAYAAJ&pg=PA142|title=The Life of Mahomet and History of Islam to the Era of the Hegira|publisher=|accessdate=17 December 2014}}</ref><br>40,000 goats<br>160,000 silver coins\n}}\n{{Campaignbox Rise of Islam}}\n{{Campaignbox Campaigns of Khalid ibn Walid}}\n{{Muhammad}}\n\nThe '''Battle of Hunayn''' ({{lang-ar| \u063a\u064e\u0640\u0632\u0648\u0629 \u062d\u064f\u0640\u0646\u0640\u064a\u0640\u0646}}, '''''Ghazwat Hunayn''''') was fought by the Islamic Prophet [[Muhammad]] and his followers against the [[Bedouin]] tribe of [[Hawazin]] and its subsection the [[Thaqif]], in 630 [[Common Era|CE]], in the Hunayn valley, on the route from [[Mecca]] to At-[[Ta\u2019if]].

When we faced the enemy, the Muslims retreated and I saw a pagan throwing himself over a Muslim. I turned around and came upon him from behind and hit him on the shoulder with the sword He (i.e. the pagan) came towards me and seized me so violently that I felt as if it were death itself, but death overtook him and he released me. I followed 'Umar bin Al Khattab and asked (him), \"What is wrong with the people (fleeing)?\" He replied, \"This is the Will of Allah,\" After the people returned, the Prophet sat and said, \"Anyone who has killed an enemy and has a proof of that, will possess his spoils.\" I got up and said, \"Who will be a witness for me?\" and then sat down. The Prophet again said, \"Anyone who has killed an enemy and has proof of that, will possess his spoils.\" I (again) got up and said, \"Who will be a witness for me?\" and sat down. Then the Prophet said the same for the third time. I again got up, and Allah's Apostle said, \"O Abu Qatada! What is your story?\" Then I narrated the whole story to him. A man (got up and) said, \"O Allah's Apostle! He is speaking the truth, and the spoils of the killed man are with me. So please compensate him on my behalf.\" On that Abu Bakr As-Siddiq said, \"No, by Allah, he (i.e. Allah's Apostle ) will not agree to give you the spoils gained by one of Allah's Lions who fights on the behalf of Allah and His Apostle.\" The Prophet said, \"Abu Bakr has spoken the truth.\" So, Allah's Apostle gave the spoils to me. I sold that armor (i.e. the spoils) and with its price I bought a garden at Bani Salima, and this was my first property which I gained after my conversion to Islam.\n{{Hadith-usc|Bukhari|4|53|370}} }}\nThe event is also in Imam Maliks [[Muwatta Imam Malik|Al-Muwatta]] as follows: \n{{cquote|bgcolor=#F0FFF0|\nYahya related to me from Malik from Ibn Shihab that al-Qasim ibn Muhammad said that he had heard a man asking ibn Abbas about booty. Ibn Abbas said, \"Horses are part of the booty and personal effects are as well.\"\nThen the man repeated his question, and Ibn Abbas repeated his answer. Then the man said, \"What are the spoils which He, the Blessed, the Exalted, mentioned in His Book?\" He kept on asking until Ibn Abbas was on the verge of being annoyed, then Ibn Abbas said, \"Do you know who this man is like? Ibn Sabigh, who was beaten by Umar ibn al-Khattab because he was notorious for asking foolish questions.\"\nYahya said that Malik was asked whether someone who killed one of the enemy could keep the man's effects without the permission of the Imam. He said, \"No one can do that without the permission of the Imam. Only the Imam can make ijtihad. I have not heard that the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, ever said, 'Whoever kills someone can have his effects,' on any other day than the day of Hunayn.\"\n{{Hadith-usc|muwatta|usc=yes|21|10|19|}} }}\n\n==See also==\n{{Wikipedia books\n |1=Military career of Muhammad\n}}\n*[[Muhammad as a warrior]]\n*[[List of expeditions of Muhammad]]\n\n==References==\n<References/>\n\n==External links==\n{{commonscatinline}}\n*[http://islamweb.net/ver2/archive/article.php?lang=E&id=40434 islamweb.net]\n*[http://islamanswers.net/moreAbout/Hunayn.htm islamanswers.net]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20051112012351/http://www.hizb-ut-tahrir.org/english/books/state/chapter_27.html ''The Battle Of Hunayn'']\n\n{{Characters and names in the Quran}}\n{{coord|22.9733|38.8197|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:Battles of Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah|Hunayn]]\n[[Category:Campaigns led by Muhammad]]\n[[Category:Battles of Khalid ibn Walid|Hunayn]]\n[[Category:630s conflicts|Hunayn]]\n[[Category:630]]\n[[Category:Qays]]\n", "name_user": "Umarabubakr", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Hunayn"}

Arghun started his career as ''bitikchi'' (secretary) in during the reign of \u00d6gedei. Later on, the latter's consort, [[Toregene Khatun]], appointed him as then governor of Transoxiana - [[Korguz]]'s ''[[basqaq]]'' and ultimately overall civil governor after [[Korguz]]'s execution IN {{Circa|1242}}.\n\n== Career ==\nHe was appointed to oversee vast lands from [[Amu Darya|Oxus]] to [[Anatolia]] with Sharaf al-Din Khwarazmi as his secretary, whom he had a distaste in.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite journal|last=Lane|first=George|date=1999|title=Arghun Aqa: Mongol bureaucrat|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00210869908701965|journal=Iranian Studies|language=en|volume=32|issue=4|pages=459\u2013482|doi=10.1080/00210869908701965|issn=0021-0862|via=}}</ref> His position was reaffirmed by [[G\u00fcy\u00fck Khan]] in 1246. [[Ascelin of Lombardia]] might have met him while he was at the court of [[Baiju]] in {{Circa|1247}}. He visited [[Karakorum]] twice after his appointment in 1248 and 1251. On his third voyage, he was upheld by [[Hulagu Khan|Hulagu]] in Transoxiana and was released after a while. His employees included the famous [[Juvayni family]], Fakr al-Din Bihishti (d. 1256), Husam al-Din Bihishti, Najm al-Din Ali, Turumtai, Naimadai and etc. He made a census in Persia in accordance with the decree of [[M\u00f6ngke Khan|M\u00f6ngke]] in 1254 along with Najm al-Din Ali.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIn 1259-61 he directed punitive operations against rebels in [[Kingdom of Georgia|Georgia]], and then was sent to [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] to fight the [[Golden Horde]]. He is described as faithful servant of the Qaghan in [[Persia]]n sources while the [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]n and [[Armenia]]n sources say he was cruel and violent overseer. However, one Georgian chronicle mentions he was a friend of equity, trustful in his language, a deep thinker, and profound in counsel. It also says Arghun conducted the empire-wide census in [[Russia]], [[Arctic]], [[Alania]], [[Pontic steppe]], Georgia, Armenia, and [[Anatolia]].<ref>H.H.Howrth-HOM, Mongols in Persia, vol.III. p.68</ref> Arghun had many political enemies at the headquarters, so he had to visit the [[ordo (palace)|''ordo'']] of the Qaghan in [[Mongolia]] often to prove his loyalty. Although, M\u00f6ngke appointed him to his former position after his accession in 1252, the Emperor summoned Arghun to answer a charge of treason. The [[Armenian people|Armenian]] noble, [[Orbelian Dynasty|Sempad Orpelian]], justified Arghun completely and charged his enemy, a [[Khorazm]]i lieutenant, with being the real offender.<ref>H.H.Howorth, HOM, Mongols in Persia, vol.III. p.65</ref> Arghun was released and they returned together.\n\n=== Under Hulagu ===\nHe mainted his administrative tasks under Hulagu and even punished underpaying vassals who owed them taxes, including [[Gvantsa Kakhaberidze]], [[Hasan Jalal|Hasan Jalal of Khachen]], [[Zakare III Zakarian]], [[Akhsitan II]] and others in 1261.

Abyssinian troops consisted of [[Amhara people|Amhara]], [[Tigrayan]] and [[Agew]] ethnic groups.

Supplied by the [[Ottoman Empire]] with firearms, Ahmad was able to defeat the Abyssinians at the [[Battle of Shimbra Kure]] in 1529 and seize control of the wealthy [[Ethiopian highlands]], though the Abyssinians continued to resist from the highlands. In 1541, the [[Portugal|Portuguese]], who had vested interests in the [[Indian Ocean]], eventually sent aid to the Abyssinians in the form of 400 [[musketeers]]. Adal, in response, received 900 from the Ottomans.\n\nImam Ahmad was initially successful against the Abyssinians while campaigning in the Autumn of 1542, killing the Portuguese commander [[Crist\u00f3v\u00e3o da Gama]] in August that year. However, Portuguese musketry proved decisive in Adal's defeat at the [[Battle of Wayna Daga]], near Lake Tana, in February 1543, where Ahmad was killed in battle. The Abyssinians subsequently retook the Amhara plateau and recouped their losses against Adal. The Ottomans, who had their own troubles to deal with in the [[Mediterranean]], were unable to help Ahmad's successors.

According to the expedition team, the sites yielded the most salient evidence of late medieval period affluence. They contained ruins of what were evidently once large cities belonging to the Adal Sultanate. Towns such as [[Awbare]], [[Awbube]], [[Amud]], [[Abasa, Somalia|Abasa]] and Gogesa, featured between 200 and 300 stone houses. The walls of certain sites still reportedly stood 18 meters high. Excavations in the area yielded 26 [[silver coin]]s, unlike the [[copper]] pieces that were more common in polities below the Horn region. The earliest of these recovered coins had been minted by Sultan [[Barquq]] (1382\u201399), also of the Egyptian Burji dynasty, and the latest were again Sultan Qaitbay issues. All of the pieces had been struck in either [[Cairo]] or [[Damascus]]. A few [[gold coin]]s were also discovered during the expedition, making the area the only place in the wider region to yield such pieces. Besides coinage, high quality [[porcelain]] was recovered from the Adal sites. The fine [[celadon]] ware was found either lying on the surface, or buried at a depth of seven and a half inches, or ensconced within dense [[midden]]s four to five feet high. Among the artefacts were grey granular [[sherd]]s with a cracked blue-green or sea-green glaze, and white crystalline fragments with an uncracked green-white glaze. Some [[Ming dynasty]] ware was also discovered, including many early Ming blue-and-white bowl sherds. They were adorned with tendril scrolls on a bluish ground and ornamented with black spotting, while other bowls had floral patterns outlined by grey or black-blue designs. Additionally, a few Ming red-and-white sherds were found, as well as white porcelain fragments with bluish highlights. The Adal sites appeared to reach an [[Indian Ocean]] terminus at the [[Sa'ad ad-Din Islands]], named for Sultan [[Sa'ad ad-Din II]] of the Ifat Sultanate.<ref name=\"Konczacki\">{{cite book|last1=Zbigniew A.

Abyssinian troops consisted of [[Amhara people|Amhara]], [[Tigrayan]] and [[Agew]] ethnic groups. Adal forces consisted mostly of [[Afar people|Afar]], [[Somalis|Somali]], [[Harla]], [[Argobba people|Argobba]], and [[Arab]] formations, supported by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottomans]].<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Gikes|first1=Patrick|title=Wars in the Horn of Africa and the dismantling of the Somali State|journal=African Studies|date=2002|volume=2|pages=89\u2013102|publisher=University of Lisbon|url=https://cea.revues.org/1280|accessdate=7 November 2016}}</ref>\n\nIn the mid-1520s, [[Imam]] [[Ahmad ibn Ibrahim al-Ghazi]] assumed control of Adal and launched a war against Abyssinia, which was then under the leadership of [[Dawit II]] (Lebna Dengel). Supplied by the [[Ottoman Empire]] with firearms, Ahmad was able to defeat the Abyssinians at the [[Battle of Shimbra Kure]] in 1529 and seize control of the wealthy [[Ethiopian highlands]], though the Abyssinians continued to resist from the highlands. In 1541, the [[Portugal|Portuguese]], who had vested interests in the [[Indian Ocean]], eventually sent aid to the Abyssinians in the form of 400 [[musketeers]]. Adal, in response, received 900 from the Ottomans.\n\nImam Ahmad was initially successful against the Abyssinians while campaigning in the Autumn of 1542, killing the Portuguese commander [[Crist\u00f3v\u00e3o da Gama]] in August that year. However, Portuguese musketry proved decisive in Adal's defeat at the [[Battle of Wayna Daga]], near Lake Tana, in February 1543, where Ahmad was killed in battle. The Abyssinians subsequently retook the Amhara plateau and recouped their losses against Adal. The Ottomans, who had their own troubles to deal with in the [[Mediterranean]], were unable to help Ahmad's successors.

According to the expedition team, the sites yielded the most salient evidence of late medieval period affluence. They contained ruins of what were evidently once large cities belonging to the Adal Sultanate. Towns such as [[Awbare]], [[Awbube]], [[Amud]], [[Abasa, Somalia|Abasa]] and Gogesa, featured between 200 and 300 stone houses. The walls of certain sites still reportedly stood 18 meters high. Excavations in the area yielded 26 [[silver coin]]s, unlike the [[copper]] pieces that were more common in polities below the Horn region. The earliest of these recovered coins had been minted by Sultan [[Barquq]] (1382\u201399), also of the Egyptian Burji dynasty, and the latest were again Sultan Qaitbay issues. All of the pieces had been struck in either [[Cairo]] or [[Damascus]]. A few [[gold coin]]s were also discovered during the expedition, making the area the only place in the wider region to yield such pieces. Besides coinage, high quality [[porcelain]] was recovered from the Adal sites. The fine [[celadon]] ware was found either lying on the surface, or buried at a depth of seven and a half inches, or ensconced within dense [[midden]]s four to five feet high. Among the artefacts were grey granular [[sherd]]s with a cracked blue-green or sea-green glaze, and white crystalline fragments with an uncracked green-white glaze. Some [[Ming dynasty]] ware was also discovered, including many early Ming blue-and-white bowl sherds. They were adorned with tendril scrolls on a bluish ground and ornamented with black spotting, while other bowls had floral patterns outlined by grey or black-blue designs. Additionally, a few Ming red-and-white sherds were found, as well as white porcelain fragments with bluish highlights. The Adal sites appeared to reach an [[Indian Ocean]] terminus at the [[Sa'ad ad-Din Islands]], named for Sultan [[Sa'ad ad-Din II]] of the Ifat Sultanate.<ref name=\"Konczacki\">{{cite book|last1=Zbigniew A.

The tasks \u2013 usually performed in isolation, but occasionally in teams \u2013 are designed to encourage the players to [[Lateral thinking|think laterally]] and creatively to complete the task.\n\nEach episode starts with the Prize Task, where each contestant donates a prize to offer up following a given theme \u2013 e.g. the contestant's most unusual item; their most treasured item; their trendiest item of clothing etc \u2013 and are all awarded to the winner of the particular episode.\n\nThree or four pre-filmed tasks follow, usually taking place in and around the Taskmaster house. Tasks are delivered to the players in an envelope with a [[Seal (emblem)|wax seal]], which the player reads aloud: e.g. \"Completely empty this [[bathtub]] \u2013 fastest wins\" or \"Impress this mayor \u2013 you have 20 minutes\". After the tasks are shown to the audience, the players justify their creative methods and argue to Davies \u2013 and among themselves \u2013 as to why they did best. After all the attempts at the task have been seen, judgement is passed by Davies and points are awarded (or players disqualified) accordingly. Normally the winner of the task gets five points, with second place score four points and so on. Some episodes feature team tasks, in which one group of two contestants and a second group of three contestants work together. The groups remain the same throughout each series. Generally, five points are split between the teams, with each member getting the same number.\n\nThe final challenge is performed live in the studio. In the event of a [[Tie (draw)|tie]], the winner is decided by a special tie-breaker task, which may either be pre-filmed or performed live.\n\nIn addition to the prizes for each episode, at the end of each series a trophy is presented to the contestant who has scored the most points over the course of the entire series. From the second series onward, the trophy took the form of a golden [[Bust (sculpture)|bust]] of Davies.\n\n== History ==\n=== Conception and beginning ===\nAccording to creator [[Alex Horne]], the show was inspired by ''[[The Crystal Maze]]'', his time working on ''[[Big Brother (UK TV series)|Big Brother]]'',<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/tv/big-brother/interviews/a659463/alex-horne-taskmaster-was-inspired-by-the-crystal-maze-and-big-brother/|title=Alex Horne: Big Brother inspired Taskmaster|date=21 July 2015|work=Digital Spy|access-date=26 September 2017|language=en}}</ref> and his jealousy at his friend Tim Key's win of the [[Edinburgh Comedy Awards|Edinburgh Comedy Award]].<ref name=\"i interview\"/>\n\nHorne first tested the idea in 2009, where he set 20 comedians \u2013 including [[Stuart Goldsmith]], [[Josie Long]], [[Mark Watson]], [[Tim Key]], [[Joe Wilkinson]] and eventual winner [[Mike Wozniak]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.comedy.co.uk/fringe/2010/alex_horne_the_taskmaster/20160711|title=Alex Horne: The Taskmaster - Edinburgh Fringe 2010 - British Comedy Guide|last=Guide|first=British Comedy|website=British Comedy Guide|language=en-GB|access-date=26 September 2017}}</ref> \u2013 monthly tasks by email over the course of a year.

[[Alex Horne]] during the [[Edinburgh Festival Fringe]] in 2010, and adapted for television in 2015. New episodes premiered on [[Dave (TV channel)|Dave]] from 2015 until 2019, when the series was acquired by [[Channel 4]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Warner |first1=Sam |title=Taskmaster is officially moving to Channel 4 |url=https://www.digitalspy.com/tv/a29888005/taskmaster-moving-channel-4/ |accessdate=22 November 2019 |work=Digital Spy |publisher=HEARST UK ENTERTAINMENT NETWORK |date=22 November 2019}}</ref> The TV series stars comedian and actor [[Greg Davies]] in the title role of the Taskmaster, issuing simple comedic and bizarre tasks to five regular contestants \u2013 usually comedians \u2013 with  Alex Horne acting as Davies's assistant and as umpire during the challenges.\n\n{{Aired episodes|2019|11|6|num=74|title=Taskmaster|finished=9|specials=2|uk=y}} Channel 4 has commissioned six additional series, which will air over three years from late 2020.<ref>{{cite news |title=Taskmaster snapped up by Channel 4 {{!}} Channel 4 |url=https://www.channel4.com/press/news/taskmaster-snapped-channel-4 |accessdate=22 November 2019 |publisher=Channel Four Television Corporation |date=22 November 2019}}</ref>\n\nInternational versions of the programme have been made in Belgium (as {{lang|nl|Het Grootste Licht}}, 'The Greatest Light'), Sweden (as ''[[B\u00e4st i Test]]'', 'Best in test'), Spain (as {{lang|es|Dicho y hecho}}, 'Said and done'), Denmark (as {{lang|da|Stormester}}, 'Grandmaster'), and Norway (as {{lang|no|Kongen befaler}}, literally 'The King commands', the Norwegian name of the game 'Simon Says'), and a [[Taskmaster (U.S. TV series)|US version]] with [[Reggie Watts]] and Horne began in April 2018.\n\n==Format==\nThe game consists of simple and bizarre challenges, ostensibly set to the contestants by Davies in his role as the Taskmaster, with assistance provided by Horne. The tasks \u2013 usually performed in isolation, but occasionally in teams \u2013 are designed to encourage the players to [[Lateral thinking|think laterally]] and creatively to complete the task.\n\nEach episode starts with the Prize Task, where each contestant donates a prize to offer up following a given theme \u2013 e.g. the contestant's most unusual item; their most treasured item; their trendiest item of clothing etc \u2013 and are all awarded to the winner of the particular episode.\n\nThree or four pre-filmed tasks follow, usually taking place in and around the Taskmaster house. Tasks are delivered to the players in an envelope with a [[Seal (emblem)|wax seal]], which the player reads aloud: e.g. \"Completely empty this [[bathtub]] \u2013 fastest wins\" or \"Impress this mayor \u2013 you have 20 minutes\". After the tasks are shown to the audience, the players justify their creative methods and argue to Davies \u2013 and among themselves \u2013 as to why they did best. After all the attempts at the task have been seen, judgement is passed by Davies and points are awarded (or players disqualified) accordingly. Normally the winner of the task gets five points, with second place score four points and so on. Some episodes feature team tasks, in which one group of two contestants and a second group of three contestants work together. The groups remain the same throughout each series. Generally, five points are split between the teams, with each member getting the same number.\n\nThe final challenge is performed live in the studio. In the event of a [[Tie (draw)|tie]], the winner is decided by a special tie-breaker task, which may either be pre-filmed or performed live.\n\nIn addition to the prizes for each episode, at the end of each series a trophy is presented to the contestant who has scored the most points over the course of the entire series. From the second series onward, the trophy took the form of a golden [[Bust (sculpture)|bust]] of Davies.\n\n== History ==\n=== Conception and beginning ===\nAccording to creator [[Alex Horne]], the show was inspired by ''[[The Crystal Maze]]'', his time working on ''[[Big Brother (UK TV series)|Big Brother]]'',<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/tv/big-brother/interviews/a659463/alex-horne-taskmaster-was-inspired-by-the-crystal-maze-and-big-brother/|title=Alex Horne: Big Brother inspired Taskmaster|date=21 July 2015|work=Digital Spy|access-date=26 September 2017|language=en}}</ref> and his jealousy at his friend Tim Key's win of the [[Edinburgh Comedy Awards|Edinburgh Comedy Award]].<ref name=\"i interview\"/>\n\nHorne first tested the idea in 2009, where he set 20 comedians \u2013 including [[Stuart Goldsmith]], [[Josie Long]], [[Mark Watson]], [[Tim Key]], [[Joe Wilkinson]] and eventual winner [[Mike Wozniak]]<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.comedy.co.uk/fringe/2010/alex_horne_the_taskmaster/20160711|title=Alex Horne: The Taskmaster - Edinburgh Fringe 2010 - British Comedy Guide|last=Guide|first=British Comedy|website=British Comedy Guide|language=en-GB|access-date=26 September 2017}}</ref> \u2013 monthly tasks by email over the course of a year.

Hilary Rosen was Deputy Director of Commissioning for the channel at the time; she was concerned with the structure of the show, as the same contestants feature in every episode of a series. This differs from other [[panel show]]s, though Horne describes ''Taskmaster'' as \"more like a [[sitcom]]\". Another issue with this format point is that it made shooting a traditional [[television pilot|pilot]] implausible.<ref name=\"chortle commission\"/> However, the aspects of the show filmed before a studio audience were tested in a pilot.<ref name=\"comedy 10\"/> In the first series, the show was shot with the intention that the episodes could be shown in any order, though Rosen later realised that \"this was a show you record and transmit in the same order\", comparing the show to a [[soap opera]].<ref name=\"chortle commission\">{{cite web|url=http://www.chortle.co.uk/news/2017/11/09/38372/why_taskmaster_was_a_hard_sell...|title=Why Taskmaster was a hard sell...|work=[[Chortle]]|date=9 November 2017|accessdate=7 December 2017}}</ref> Horne says that the comedians began to sign up for the show after [[Frank Skinner]] agreed to take part.<ref name=\"chortle commission\"/>\n\n=== Broadcast ===\nThe first series was announced on 19 September 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.comedy.co.uk/tv/news/1610/taskmaster_starring_alex_horne_and_greg_davies/|title=Alex Horne and Greg Davies star in new show Taskmaster|publisher=[[British Comedy Guide]]|date=19 September 2014|accessdate=7 December 2017}}</ref> Lasting six episodes, it aired in 2015 from 28 July to 1 September, featuring contestants [[Frank Skinner]], [[Josh Widdicombe]], [[Roisin Conaty]], [[Romesh Ranganathan]] and [[Tim Key]].

Kim Pyong-sik worked for the Union of Korean Students in Japan and the North Korean Central News Agency. After the creation of the General Association of [[Koreans in Japan|Koreans residing in Japan]] ([[Chongryon]], pro-communist organization) in 1955, he held important positions within this organization. Later, he returned to North Korea and joined the [[Korean Social Democratic Party]], a party that became pro-communist under [[Choi Yong-kun]] which closely related with the Workers' Party of Korea.

Chemically, Earth can be divided into the crust, upper mantle, lower mantle, outer core, and inner core. The geologic component layers of Earth are at the following depths below the surface:<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |last=Montagner |first=Jean-Paul |title=Earth's structure, global |editor-last1=Gupta |editor-first1=Harsh |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of solid earth geophysics |date=2011 |publisher=Springer Science & Business Media |isbn=9789048187010 |pages=134\u2013154}}</ref>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|-\n!Depth (km) \n!Layer\n|-\n| 0\u201380\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"| Lithosphere (locally varies between 5 and 200&nbsp;km)\n|- style=\"background: #FEFEFE;\"\n| 0\u201335\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"| ...

The core does not allow shear waves to pass through it, while the speed of travel ([[seismic velocity]]) is different in other layers.  The changes in seismic velocity between different layers causes refraction owing to [[Snell's law]], like light bending as it passes through a prism.

The thicker crust is [[continental crust]], which is less dense and composed of ([[felsic]]) [[sodium]] potassium [[aluminium]] silicate rocks, like [[granite]]. The rocks of the crust fall into two major categories \u2013 sial and sima (Suess, 1831\u20131914). It is estimated that sima starts about 11&nbsp;km below the [[Conrad discontinuity]] (a second order discontinuity). The uppermost mantle together with the crust constitutes the [[lithosphere]]. The crust-mantle boundary occurs as two physically different events. First, there is a discontinuity in the [[seismic wave|seismic]] velocity, which is most commonly known as the [[Mohorovi\u010di\u0107 discontinuity]] or Moho. The cause of the Moho is thought to be a change in rock composition from rocks containing [[feldspar|plagioclase feldspar]] (above) to rocks that contain no feldspars (below). Second, in oceanic crust, there is a [[chemistry|chemical]] discontinuity between [[ultramafic]] cumulates and tectonized [[Peridotite|harzburgites]], which has been observed from deep parts of the oceanic crust that have been [[obduction|obducted]] onto the continental crust and preserved as [[ophiolites|ophiolite sequences]].\n\nMany rocks now making up Earth's crust formed less than 100 million (1{{e|8}}) years ago; however, the oldest known mineral grains are about 4.4 billion (4.4{{e|9}}) years old, indicating that Earth has had a solid crust for at least 4.4 billion years.<ref>[http://spaceflightnow.com/news/n0101/14earthwater/ Breaking News | Oldest rock shows Earth was a hospitable young planet].

This is an area of active research.\n\nIn early stages of Earth's formation about 4.6 billion years ago, melting would have caused denser substances to sink toward the center in a process called [[planetary differentiation]] (see also the [[iron catastrophe]]), while less-dense materials would have migrated to the [[crust (geology)|crust]]. The core is thus believed to largely be composed of iron (80%), along with [[nickel]] and one or more light elements, whereas other dense elements, such as [[lead]] and [[uranium]], either are too rare to be significant or tend to bind to lighter elements and thus remain in the crust (see [[felsic|felsic materials]]). Some have argued that the inner core may be in the form of a single iron [[crystal]].<ref>{{cite book |last=Schneider |first=Michael | chapter-url=http://www.psc.edu/science/Cohen_Stix/cohen_stix.html |chapter=Crystal at the Center of the Earth |title=Projects in Scientific Computing, 1996|publisher=Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center |date=1996 |accessdate=8 March 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|doi=10.1126/science.267.5206.1972|title=High-Pressure Elasticity of Iron and Anisotropy of Earth's Inner Core|year=1995|last1=Stixrude|first1=L.|last2=Cohen|first2=R.E.|journal=Science|volume=267|issue=5206|pages=1972\u201375|pmid=17770110|bibcode = 1995Sci...267.1972S }}</ref>\n\nUnder laboratory conditions a sample of iron\u2013nickel alloy was subjected to the corelike pressures by gripping it in a vise between 2 diamond tips ([[diamond anvil cell]]), and then heating to approximately 4000 K.

Beginning as early as 1940, scientists, including [[Francis Birch (geophysicist)|Francis Birch]], built geophysics upon the premise that Earth is like ordinary chondrites, the most common type of meteorite observed impacting Earth, while totally ignoring another, albeit less abundant type, called [[enstatite]] chondrites. The principal difference between the two meteorite types is that enstatite chondrites formed under circumstances of extremely limited available oxygen, leading to certain normally oxyphile elements existing either partially or wholly in the alloy portion that corresponds to the core of Earth.\n\n[[Dynamo theory]] suggests that convection in the outer core, combined with the [[Coriolis effect]], gives rise to [[Earth's magnetic field]]. The solid inner core is too hot to hold a permanent magnetic field (see [[Curie temperature]]) but probably acts to stabilize the magnetic field generated by the liquid outer core. The average magnetic field strength in Earth's outer core is estimated to be 25 Gauss (2.5&nbsp;mT), 50 times stronger than the magnetic field at the surface.<ref>[http://www.science20.com/news_articles/first_measurement_magnetic_field_inside_earths_core First Measurement Of Magnetic Field Inside Earth's Core].

The core does not allow shear waves to pass through it, while the speed of travel ([[seismic velocity]]) is different in other layers.

The rocks of the crust fall into two major categories \u2013 sial and sima (Suess, 1831\u20131914). It is estimated that sima starts about 11&nbsp;km below the [[Conrad discontinuity]] (a second order discontinuity). The uppermost mantle together with the crust constitutes the [[lithosphere]]. The crust-mantle boundary occurs as two physically different events. First, there is a discontinuity in the [[seismic wave|seismic]] velocity, which is most commonly known as the [[Mohorovi\u010di\u0107 discontinuity]] or Moho. The cause of the Moho is thought to be a change in rock composition from rocks containing [[feldspar|plagioclase feldspar]] (above) to rocks that contain no feldspars (below). Second, in oceanic crust, there is a [[chemistry|chemical]] discontinuity between [[ultramafic]] cumulates and tectonized [[Peridotite|harzburgites]], which has been observed from deep parts of the oceanic crust that have been [[obduction|obducted]] onto the continental crust and preserved as [[ophiolites|ophiolite sequences]].\n\nMany rocks now making up Earth's crust formed less than 100 million (1{{e|8}}) years ago; however, the oldest known mineral grains are about 4.4 billion (4.4{{e|9}}) years old, indicating that Earth has had a solid crust for at least 4.4 billion years.<ref>[http://spaceflightnow.com/news/n0101/14earthwater/ Breaking News | Oldest rock shows Earth was a hospitable young planet].

This is an area of active research.\n\nIn early stages of Earth's formation about 4.6 billion years ago, melting would have caused denser substances to sink toward the center in a process called [[planetary differentiation]] (see also the [[iron catastrophe]]), while less-dense materials would have migrated to the [[crust (geology)|crust]]. The core is thus believed to largely be composed of iron (80%), along with [[nickel]] and one or more light elements, whereas other dense elements, such as [[lead]] and [[uranium]], either are too rare to be significant or tend to bind to lighter elements and thus remain in the crust (see [[felsic|felsic materials]]).

Beginning as early as 1940, scientists, including [[Francis Birch (geophysicist)|Francis Birch]], built geophysics upon the premise that Earth is like ordinary chondrites, the most common type of meteorite observed impacting Earth, while totally ignoring another, albeit less abundant type, called [[enstatite]] chondrites. The principal difference between the two meteorite types is that enstatite chondrites formed under circumstances of extremely limited available oxygen, leading to certain normally oxyphile elements existing either partially or wholly in the alloy portion that corresponds to the core of Earth.\n\n[[Dynamo theory]] suggests that convection in the outer core, combined with the [[Coriolis effect]], gives rise to [[Earth's magnetic field]]. The solid inner core is too hot to hold a permanent magnetic field (see [[Curie temperature]]) but probably acts to stabilize the magnetic field generated by the liquid outer core. The average magnetic field strength in Earth's outer core is estimated to be 25 Gauss (2.5&nbsp;mT), 50 times stronger than the magnetic field at the surface.<ref>[http://www.science20.com/news_articles/first_measurement_magnetic_field_inside_earths_core First Measurement Of Magnetic Field Inside Earth's Core].

The history of sailing yachts begins in Europe in the beginning of the 1600s with the building of a pleasure vessel for the son of [[James VI and I|King James I of England]]. Pleasure vessels acquired the name ''yacht'' after the time of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], who spent time exiled in Europe and visited the Netherlands, where a variety of yachts (''jaghts'' in Dutch) were already well-developed as pleasure boats for the elite classes since the beginning of the 17th century. Upon his restoration to the English crown, Charles commissioned a series of royal yachts, which included at least one experimental [[catamaran]]. The first recorded yacht race between two vessels occurred in 1661, followed by the first open sailing competition in 1663 in English waters.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Herreshoff|first=L.

In Ireland, however, the gentry enjoyed yachting and founded the first yacht club in Cork as the Cork Harbor Water Club in 1720. English yacht racing continued among the English gentry who founded England's oldest yacht club in 1775 to support a fleet at [[Cumberland]]. With maritime peace, starting in 1815, came a resurgence of interest in yachting. Boatbuilders, who had been making fast vessels both for smugglers and the government [[Cutter (boat)|revenue cutters]], turned their skills again to yachts.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Evolution of design ===\nThe fast yachts of the early 19th century were typically [[lugger]]s, [[schooner]]s, or [[sloop]]s with [[fore-and-aft rig]]s. By the 1850s, yachts featured large sail areas, a narrow beam, and a deeper draft than was customary until then. Racing between yachts owned by wealthy patrons was common, with large wagers at stake. The [[America's Cup]] arose out of a contest between the yacht, ''[[America (yacht)|America]]'', and its English competitors. Both countries had rules by which to rate yachts, the English by tonnage and the American by length.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nEnglish and American design philosophies for sailing yachts diverged in the early 1800s: the English favoring a narrow [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] (width) and a deep-draft keel and the Americans favoring a broad beam and a shallow draft with a moveable centerboard to provide lateral resistance and righting moment. In 1851, when the yacht ''America'' crossed to England, the two design philosophies were converging back towards each other. ''America's'' pointed, convex bow and maximum beam, placed aft, influenced British designs, thanks to her racing successes against the British competition. American yachtsmen, in turn, found that their shallow \"skimming-dish\" designs weren't faster or safer than the visiting English yachts.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|last=Doane, Charles J.|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/551161085|title=The modern cruising sailboat : a complete guide to its design, construction, and outfitting|date=2010|publisher=International Marine|isbn=978-0-07-163700-8|location=Camden, Me.|oclc=551161085}}</ref>\n\nBy the turn of the 20th century, racing yachts featured long overhangs, fore and aft, and a narrow, deep keel by historic standards. Along the way, yacht designers discovered that handicapping rules based on tonnage or length were not good indicators of performance, although they remained a basis for taxation in the two home countries.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Cruising yachts ===\nThe prevalent purpose of yachting under sail in the 19th was racing. Boats would cross the Atlantic to engage the yachts of other owners in contests of speed. Cruising was the provenance of the most wealthy in large, luxurious yachts that had reliable auxiliary power or were solely steam-powered yachts.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nEarly explorers in smaller sailing craft wrote of their experiences cruising the lakes and canals of Europe in a sailing canoe ([[John MacGregor (sportsman)|John MacGregor]]) and the near-shore waters of England and Scotland in a {{Convert|20|ft|m|abbr=|adj=on}} [[Cutter (boat)|cutter]] (R.T. McMullen). In the late 1800s some cruising adventurers converted fishing vessels and pilot boats into cruising boats. The most note of these was [[Joshua Slocum|Joshua Slocum's]] ''[[Spray (sailing vessel)|Spray]]'', a converted work boat in which he accomplished the first single-handed circumnavigation.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIn the 20th century, cruising yacht design evolved past the handicapping rules-based designs of the 19th century towards more sea-kindly hull designs. In the 1930s yacht hulls were designed with a \"fisherman\" underbody, whereby the slope of the bow continued to the fullest extent of the draft and then carried horizontally aft. Noted yacht designers, such as [[John Alden (naval architect)|John Alden]] and [[William Starling Burgess|Starling Burgess]] employed this configuration. Starting in the 1920s several new rating rules were devised by the [[Cruising Club of America]] and the [[Royal Ocean Racing Club]] in order to handicap yachts of different designs that were expected to compete against one another. Successful designers of this era were [[Olin Stephens]], [[Philip Rhodes]], Aage Nielson, and C. Raymond Hunt. The International Offshore Racing (IOR) rule supplanted the previous rules in 1970 to provide a fairer basis for handicapping racing yachts. This rule promoted the use of fin keels and blade rudders. This rule was augmented with the International Measurement System (IMS) to assure safe designs for extreme conditions, following the disastrous [[1979 Fastnet race|1979 Fastnet Race]] in which only 86 of the 303 participants finished owing to failed equipment and loss of 19 lives and five boats.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Technical Committee|first=Cruising Club of America|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/14377959|title=Desirable and undesirable characteristics of offshore yachts|date=1987|publisher=W.W.

The history of sailing yachts begins in Europe in the beginning of the 1600s with the building of a pleasure vessel for the son of [[James VI and I|King James I of England]]. Pleasure vessels acquired the name ''yacht'' after the time of [[Charles II of England|Charles II]], who spent time exiled in Europe and visited the Netherlands, where a variety of yachts (''jaghts'' in Dutch) were already well-developed as pleasure boats for the elite classes since the beginning of the 17th century. Upon his restoration to the English crown, Charles commissioned a series of royal yachts, which included at least one experimental [[catamaran]]. The first recorded yacht race between two vessels occurred in 1661, followed by the first open sailing competition in 1663 in English waters.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|last=Herreshoff|first=L.

In Ireland, however, the gentry enjoyed yachting and founded the first yacht club in Cork as the Cork Harbor Water Club in 1720. English yacht racing continued among the English gentry who founded England's oldest yacht club in 1775 to support a fleet at [[Cumberland]]. With maritime peace, starting in 1815, came a resurgence of interest in yachting. Boatbuilders, who had been making fast vessels both for smugglers and the government [[Cutter (boat)|revenue cutters]], turned their skills again to yachts.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Evolution of design ===\nThe fast yachts of the early 19th century were typically [[lugger]]s, [[schooner]]s, or [[sloop]]s with [[fore-and-aft rig]]s. By the 1850s, yachts featured large sail areas, a narrow beam, and a deeper draft than was customary until then. Racing between yachts owned by wealthy patrons was common, with large wagers at stake. The [[America's Cup]] arose out of a contest between the yacht, ''[[America (yacht)|America]]'', and its English competitors. Both countries had rules by which to rate yachts, the English by tonnage and the American by length.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nEnglish and American design philosophies for sailing yachts diverged in the early 1800s: the English favoring a narrow [[Beam (nautical)|beam]] (width) and a deep-draft keel and the Americans favoring a broad beam and a shallow draft with a moveable centerboard to provide lateral resistance and righting moment. In 1851, when the yacht ''America'' crossed to England, the two design philosophies were converging back towards each other. ''America's'' pointed, convex bow and maximum beam, placed aft, influenced British designs, thanks to her racing successes against the British competition. American yachtsmen, in turn, found that their shallow \"skimming-dish\" designs weren't faster or safer than the visiting English yachts.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite book|last=Doane, Charles J.|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/551161085|title=The modern cruising sailboat : a complete guide to its design, construction, and outfitting|date=2010|publisher=International Marine|isbn=978-0-07-163700-8|location=Camden, Me.|oclc=551161085}}</ref>\n\nBy the turn of the 20th century, racing yachts featured long overhangs, fore and aft, and a narrow, deep keel by historic standards. Along the way, yacht designers discovered that handicapping rules based on tonnage or length were not good indicators of performance, although they remained a basis for taxation in the two home countries.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\n=== Cruising yachts ===\nThe prevalent purpose of yachting under sail in the 19th was racing. Boats would cross the Atlantic to engage the yachts of other owners in contests of speed. Cruising was the provenance of the most wealthy in large, luxurious yachts that had reliable auxiliary power or were solely steam-powered yachts.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nEarly explorers in smaller sailing craft wrote of their experiences cruising the lakes and canals of Europe in a sailing canoe ([[John MacGregor (sportsman)|John MacGregor]]) and the near-shore waters of England and Scotland in a {{Convert|20|ft|m|abbr=|adj=on}} [[Cutter (boat)|cutter]] (R.T. McMullen). In the late 1800s some cruising adventurers converted fishing vessels and pilot boats into cruising boats. The most note of these was [[Joshua Slocum|Joshua Slocum's]] ''[[Spray (sailing vessel)|Spray]]'', a converted work boat in which he accomplished the first single-handed circumnavigation.<ref name=\":1\" />\n\nIn the 20th century, cruising yacht design evolved past the handicapping rules-based designs of the 19th century towards more sea-kindly hull designs. In the 1930s yacht hulls were designed with a \"fisherman\" underbody, whereby the slope of the bow continued to the fullest extent of the draft and then carried horizontally aft. Noted yacht designers, such as [[John Alden (naval architect)|John Alden]] and [[William Starling Burgess|Starling Burgess]] employed this configuration. Starting in the 1920s several new rating rules were devised by the [[Cruising Club of America]] and the [[Royal Ocean Racing Club]] in order to handicap yachts of different designs that were expected to compete against one another. Successful designers of this era were [[Olin Stephens]], [[Philip Rhodes]], Aage Nielson, and C. Raymond Hunt. The International Offshore Racing (IOR) rule supplanted the previous rules in 1970 to provide a fairer basis for handicapping racing yachts. This rule promoted the use of fin keels and blade rudders. This rule was augmented with the International Measurement System (IMS) to assure safe designs for extreme conditions, following the disastrous [[1979 Fastnet race|1979 Fastnet Race]] in which only 86 of the 303 participants finished owing to failed equipment and loss of 19 lives and five boats.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Technical Committee|first=Cruising Club of America|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/14377959|title=Desirable and undesirable characteristics of offshore yachts|date=1987|publisher=W.W.

However, the infrastructural development and maintenance was taken care of by the Public Works Department of [[Government of Bangladesh]]. To remove these kinds of aforesaid problems several committees and commissions were formed since 1973. On the recommendation of these committees and commissions, in 1986, Rajshahi Engineering College was converted to an institute and was named Bangladesh Institute of Technology (BIT), Rajshahi to enhance the technical education.<ref>{{cite news |title=KUET, RUET, DUET celebrate founding anniversary |url=http://www.theindependentbd.com/printversion/details/14093 |newspaper=The Independent |location=Dhaka |date=2015-09-02 |access-date=2016-12-12}}</ref>\n\nIn September, 2003, the institute was upgraded to a university and was named as Rajshahi University of Engineering & Technology (RUET) to enhance the technical education and research.<ref>{{cite news |title=RUET celebrates 13th anniversary |url=http://www.thedailystar.net/city/ruet-celebrates-13th-anniversary-1279189 |newspaper=The Daily Star |date=2016-09-02 |access-date=2016-12-12}}</ref> From that time, the university is financed by the Government through the [[University Grants Commission (Bangladesh)|University Grants Commission (UGC) of Bangladesh]].
