Alternative media used for comparative experiments contained either high levels of [[phosphate]] (1.5&nbsp;mM) with no arsenate, or had neither added phosphate nor added arsenate.  It was observed that GFAJ-1 could grow through many doublings in cell numbers when cultured in either phosphate or arsenate media, but could not grow when placed in a medium of a similar composition to which neither phosphate nor arsenate was added.<ref name=\"Science\"/> The phosphorus content of the arsenic-fed, phosphorus-starved bacteria (as measured by [[Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry|ICP-MS)]] was only 0.019 (\u00b1 0.001) % by dry weight, one thirtieth of that when grown in phosphate-rich medium. This phosphorus content was also only about one tenth of the cells' average arsenic content (0.19 \u00b1 0.25% by dry weight).<ref name=\"Science\"/> The arsenic content of cells as measured by ICP-MS varies widely and can be lower than the phosphorus contents in some experiments, and up to fourteen times higher in others.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://dels.nas.edu/resources/static-assets/bcst/miscellaneous/WolfeSimon.pdf | title = Geobiochemistry: Microbes and the four basic strategies for Life on Earth | author =  Felisa Wolfe-Simon }}</ref> Other data from the same study obtained with nano-[[Secondary ion mass spectrometry|SIMS]] suggest a ~75-fold excess of phosphate (P) over arsenic (As) when expressed as P:C and As:C ratios, even in cells grown with arsenate and no added phosphate.<ref name=SupportingMaterial/> When cultured in the arsenate solution, GFAJ-1 only grew 60% as fast as it did in phosphate solution.<ref name=Alla/> The phosphate-starved bacteria had an intracellular volume 1.5&nbsp;times normal; the greater volume appeared to be associated with the appearance of large \"[[vacuole]]-like regions\".<ref name=\"Science\"/>\n[[File:GFAJ-1 (grown on phosphorus).jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Scanning electron micrograph]] of GFAJ-1 cells grown in defined minimal medium supplemented with 1.5&nbsp;mM phosphate]]\nWhen the researchers added [[Isotopic labeling|isotope-labeled]] arsenate to the solution to [[pulse-chase analysis|track its distribution]], they found that arsenic was present in the cellular fractions containing the bacteria's [[protein]]s, [[lipid]]s and metabolites such as [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]], as well as its [[DNA]] and [[RNA]].<ref name=Alla/> Nucleic acids from [[Bacterial growth|stationary phase]] cells starved of phosphorus were concentrated via five [[Liquid-liquid extraction|extraction]]s (one with [[phenol]], three with [[phenol-chloroform extraction|phenol-chloroform]] and one with [[chloroform]] extraction solvent), followed by [[Ethanol precipitation#DNA Precipitation|ethanol precipitation]]. Although direct evidence of the incorporation of arsenic into biomolecules is still lacking, [[Radioactivity in the life sciences|radioactivity]] measurements suggested that approximately one-tenth (11.0 \u00b1 0.1%) of the arsenic absorbed by these bacteria ended up in the fraction that contained the [[nucleic acids]] (DNA and RNA) and all other co-precipitated compounds not extracted by the previous treatments.<ref name=\"Science\"/> A comparable control experiment with isotope-labeled phosphate was not performed.\nWith the distribution of the strain in mid-2011, other labs began to independently test the validity of the discovery. [[Rosemary Redfield]] from the [[University of British Columbia]], following issues with the growth conditions, investigated the growth requirements of GFAJ-1, and found that the strain grows better on solid [[agar]] medium than in liquid culture.

Alternative media used for comparative experiments contained either high levels of [[phosphate]] (1.5&nbsp;mM) with no arsenate, or had neither added phosphate nor added arsenate.  It was observed that GFAJ-1 could grow through many doublings in cell numbers when cultured in either phosphate or arsenate media, but could not grow when placed in a medium of a similar composition to which neither phosphate nor arsenate was added.<ref name=\"Science\"/> The phosphorus content of the arsenic-fed, phosphorus-starved bacteria (as measured by [[Inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry|ICP-MS)]] was only 0.019 (\u00b1 0.001) % by dry weight, one thirtieth of that when grown in phosphate-rich medium. This phosphorus content was also only about one tenth of the cells' average arsenic content (0.19 \u00b1 0.25% by dry weight).<ref name=\"Science\"/> The arsenic content of cells as measured by ICP-MS varies widely and can be lower than the phosphorus contents in some experiments, and up to fourteen times higher in others.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://dels.nas.edu/resources/static-assets/bcst/miscellaneous/WolfeSimon.pdf | title = Geobiochemistry: Microbes and the four basic strategies for Life on Earth | author =  Felisa Wolfe-Simon }}</ref> Other data from the same study obtained with nano-[[Secondary ion mass spectrometry|SIMS]] suggest a ~75-fold excess of phosphate (P) over arsenic (As) when expressed as P:C and As:C ratios, even in cells grown with arsenate and no added phosphate.<ref name=SupportingMaterial/> When cultured in the arsenate solution, GFAJ-1 only grew 60% as fast as it did in phosphate solution.<ref name=Alla/> The phosphate-starved bacteria had an intracellular volume 1.5&nbsp;times normal; the greater volume appeared to be associated with the appearance of large \"[[vacuole]]-like regions\".<ref name=\"Science\"/>\n[[File:GFAJ-1 (grown on phosphorus).jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Scanning electron micrograph]] of GFAJ-1 cells grown in defined minimal medium supplemented with 1.5&nbsp;mM phosphate]]\nWhen the researchers added [[Isotopic labeling|isotope-labeled]] arsenate to the solution to [[pulse-chase analysis|track its distribution]], they found that arsenic was present in the cellular fractions containing the bacteria's [[protein]]s, [[lipid]]s and metabolites such as [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]], as well as its [[DNA]] and [[RNA]].<ref name=Alla/> Nucleic acids from [[Bacterial growth|stationary phase]] cells starved of phosphorus were concentrated via five [[Liquid-liquid extraction|extraction]]s (one with [[phenol]], three with [[phenol-chloroform extraction|phenol-chloroform]] and one with [[chloroform]] extraction solvent), followed by [[Ethanol precipitation#DNA Precipitation|ethanol precipitation]]. Although direct evidence of the incorporation of arsenic into biomolecules is still lacking, [[Radioactivity in the life sciences|radioactivity]] measurements suggested that approximately one-tenth (11.0 \u00b1 0.1%) of the arsenic absorbed by these bacteria ended up in the fraction that contained the [[nucleic acids]] (DNA and RNA) and all other co-precipitated compounds not extracted by the previous treatments.<ref name=\"Science\"/> A comparable control experiment with isotope-labeled phosphate was not performed.\nWith the distribution of the strain in mid-2011, other labs began to independently test the validity of the discovery. [[Rosemary Redfield]] from the [[University of British Columbia]], following issues with the growth conditions, investigated the growth requirements of GFAJ-1, and found that the strain grows better on solid [[agar]] medium than in liquid culture.

Some of them are perennial in nature, others come up on an annual basis while others are biennial in nature. The perennial ones are often very difficult to control. They keep regenerating despite every effort to control them. The annual and biennial ones are easier to deal with. Looking at their visual nature, broadleaf weeds have wide leaves in common. They also have a main center vein that connects to smaller veins which shoot out from a branch. Despite this, they also differ in various  aspects.<ref name=\"MISS\"/>\n\nMost broadleaf weeds develop clusters of blossoms or single flowers as they mature. Such flowers are not aesthetic in nature. They often come in diverse colors such as white, blue, purple, red and so on. Some of them come with  mixed colored flowers while others bear single colored flowers. Despite this, they still appear  unruffled when clustered around a yard or lawn.\n\nThe roots of most broadleaf weeds are fibrous in nature. Some of them spring up with thin roots. Others spring up with a massive taproot while some of them spring up with both types of root systems.  A good number of broadleaf weeds spread through their seeds and rhizomes. Some of them only spread through seeds while others spread through seeds and rhizomes.<ref name=\"UPS\"/>\n\n==Common broadleaf weeds==\nThere are several types of broadleaf weeds  growing in lawns, gardens and yards across the globe.<ref>{{cite news | last = | first =| title =Broadleaf Weeds| newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =plantscience.psu.edu| date = | url =https://plantscience.psu.edu/research/centers/turf/extension/plant-id/broadleaf | accessdate =30 May 2019}}</ref> Outlined below are the most common broadleaf weeds with their [[Binomial nomenclature|binomial names]]:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Some of them are perennial in nature, others come up on an annual basis while others are biennial in nature. The perennial ones are often very difficult to control. They keep regenerating despite every effort to control them. The annual and biennial ones are easier to deal with. Looking at their visual nature, broadleaf weeds have wide leaves in common. They also have a main center vein that connects to smaller veins which shoot out from a branch. Despite this, they also differ in various  aspects.<ref name=\"MISS\"/>\n\nMost broadleaf weeds develop clusters of blossoms or single flowers as they mature. Such flowers are not aesthetic in nature. They often come in diverse colors such as white, blue, purple, red and so on. Some of them come with  mixed colored flowers while others bear single colored flowers. Despite this, they still appear  unruffled when clustered around a yard or lawn.\n\nThe roots of most broadleaf weeds are fibrous in nature. Some of them spring up with thin roots. Others spring up with a massive taproot while some of them spring up with both types of root systems.  A good number of broadleaf weeds spread through their seeds and rhizomes. Some of them only spread through seeds while others spread through seeds and rhizomes.<ref name=\"UPS\"/>\n\n==Common broadleaf weeds==\nThere are several types of broadleaf weeds  growing in lawns, gardens and yards across the globe.<ref>{{cite news | last = | first =| title =Broadleaf Weeds| newspaper =| location = | pages = | language = | publisher =plantscience.psu.edu| date = | url =https://plantscience.psu.edu/research/centers/turf/extension/plant-id/broadleaf | accessdate =30 May 2019}}</ref> Outlined below are the most common broadleaf weeds with their [[Binomial nomenclature|binomial names]]:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

The main statutes are the [[Sherman Act of 1890]], the [[Clayton Act of 1914]] and the [[Federal Trade Commission Act of 1914]]. These Acts serve three major functions. First, Section 1 of the Sherman Act prohibits price-fixing and the operation of [[cartel]]s, and prohibits other collusive practices that unreasonably restrain trade. Second, Section 7 of the Clayton Act restricts the [[mergers and acquisitions]] of organizations that would likely substantially lessen competition. Third, Section 2 of the Sherman Act prohibits the abuse of monopoly power.<ref>For a general framework, see Thibault Schrepel, A New Structured Rule of Reason Approach for High-Tech Markets, Suffolk University Law Review, Vol. 50, No. 1, 2017 at https://ssrn.com/abstract=2908838</ref>\n\nFederal antitrust laws provide for both civil and criminal enforcement of antitrust laws. The [[Federal Trade Commission]], the [[United States Department of Justice Antitrust Division|Antitrust Division]] of the [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Department of Justice]], and private parties who are sufficiently affected may all bring civil actions in the courts to enforce the antitrust laws. However, criminal antitrust enforcement is done only by the Justice Department. U.S. states also have antitrust statutes that govern commerce occurring solely within their state borders.\n\nThe scope of antitrust laws, and the degree to which they should interfere in an enterprise's freedom to conduct business, or to protect smaller businesses, communities and consumers, are strongly debated. One view, mostly closely associated with the \"[[Chicago School of economics]]\" suggests that antitrust laws should focus solely on the benefits to consumers and overall efficiency, while a broad range of legal and economic theory sees the role of antitrust laws as also controlling [[economic power]] in the public interest.<ref>See generally [[Herbert Hovenkamp]], 'Chicago and Its Alternatives' (1986) 6 Duke Law Journal 1014\u20131029, and [[RH Bork]], ''[[The Antitrust Paradox]]'' (Free Press 1993.)</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{main|History of United States antitrust law|History of competition law}}\n\n{{More citations needed section|date=May 2017}}\n\nAlthough \"[[Trust law|trust]]\" has a specific legal meaning (where one person holds property for the benefit of another), in the late 19th century the word was commonly used to denote big business, because that legal instrument was frequently used to effect a combination of companies.<ref>For example, the Standard Oil Trust was formed in 1882 to combine the Standard Oil Company and a number of other companies that were engaged in producing, refining, and marketing oil. Under the Standard Oil Trust Agreement, the companies transferred their stock \"in trust\" to nine trustees headed by [[John D. Rockefeller]] and in exchange received a beneficial interest in the trust. Eventually, the trustees governed some 40 corporations, of which the trust wholly owned 14. In 1899, however, the trust renamed its New Jersey firm Standard Oil Company (New Jersey) and incorporated it as a holding company. All assets and interests formerly grouped in the trust were then transferred to the New Jersey company. Because of Standard Oil's monopolistic conduct, in 1911 the Supreme Court, in ''[[Standard Oil Co. v. United States]]'', ordered the break-up of the business organization. The New Jersey company was ordered to divest itself of its major holdings\u201433 companies in all.

John Sherman, of Ohio, Delivered in the Senate of the United States, Friday, March 21, 1890</ref> The [[Interstate Commerce Act]] of 1887 began a shift towards federal rather than state regulation of big business.<ref>[http://law.jrank.org/pages/7759/Interstate-Commerce-Act.html Interstate Commerce Act].</ref> It was followed by the [[Sherman Antitrust Act]] of 1890, the [[Clayton Antitrust Act]] of 1914 and the [[Federal Trade Commission Act]] of 1914, the [[Robinson\u2013Patman Act]] of 1936, and the [[Celler\u2013Kefauver Act]] of 1950.\n\nIn the 1880s, hundreds of small short-line railroads were being bought up and consolidated into giant systems. (Separate laws and policies emerged regarding railroads and financial concerns such as banks and insurance companies.) People for strong antitrust laws argued that, in order for the American economy to be successful, it would require free competition and the opportunity for individual Americans to build their own businesses. As Senator [[John Sherman (politician)|John Sherman]] put it, \"If we will not endure a king as a political power we should not endure a king over the production, transportation, and sale of any of the necessaries of life.\" Congress passed the [[Sherman Antitrust Act]] almost unanimously in 1890, and it remains the core of antitrust policy. The Act prohibits agreements in restraint of trade and abuse of monopoly power. It gives the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] the mandate to go to federal court for orders to stop illegal behavior or to impose remedies.<ref>Since the passage of the Federal Trade Commission Act in 1914, the [[Federal Trade Commission|FTC]] has had power to enforce section 1 of the Sherman Act administratively, under the rubric of section 5 of the FTC Act, 15 U.S.C. sec. 45. See generally [[FTC v. Sperry & Hutchinson Trading Stamp Co.]] As that Supreme Court decision explains, the FTC also has authority to act against incipient Sherman Act violations and violations of its \"spirit.\"</ref>{{original research inline|date=May 2017}}\n\nPublic officials during the [[Progressive Era]] put passing and enforcing strong antitrust high on their agenda. President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] sued 45 companies under the Sherman Act, while [[William Howard Taft]] sued almost 90. In 1902, Roosevelt stopped the formation of the [[Northern Securities Company]], which threatened to monopolize transportation in the Northwest (see ''[[Northern Securities Co. v. United States]]'').\n\n[[File:Standard Oil.jpg|thumb|right|[[Standard Oil]] (Refinery No. 1 in [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]], pictured) was a major company broken up under United States antitrust laws.]]\nOne of the better-known trusts was the [[Standard Oil|Standard Oil Company]]; [[John D. Rockefeller]] in the 1870s and 1880s had used economic threats against competitors and secret rebate deals with railroads to build what was called a monopoly in the oil business, though some minor competitors remained in business. In 1911 the Supreme Court agreed that in recent years (1900\u20131904) Standard had violated the Sherman Act (see ''[[Standard Oil Co. of New Jersey v. United States]]''). It broke the monopoly into three dozen separate companies that competed with one another, including Standard Oil of New Jersey (later known as [[Exxon]] and now [[ExxonMobil]]), Standard Oil of Indiana ([[Amoco]]), Standard Oil Company of New York ([[Mobil]], again, later merged with Exxon to form ExxonMobil), of California ([[Chevron Corporation|Chevron]]), Cleveland-based [[Standard Oil of Ohio|SOHIO]] - the parent of the trust, and so on. In approving the breakup the Supreme Court added the \"rule of reason\": not all big companies, and not all monopolies, are evil; and the courts (not the executive branch) are to make that decision. To be harmful, a trust had to somehow damage the economic environment of its competitors.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\n[[U.S. Steel|United States Steel Corporation]], which was much larger than Standard Oil, won its antitrust suit in 1920 despite never having delivered the benefits to consumers that Standard Oil did.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} In fact, it lobbied for tariff protection that reduced competition, and so contending that it was one of the \"good trusts\" that benefited the economy is somewhat doubtful.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} Likewise [[International Harvester]] survived its court test, while other monopolies were broken up in [[tobacco]], meatpacking, and bathtub fixtures. Over the years hundreds of executives of competing companies who met together illegally to fix prices went to federal prison.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nIn 1914 Congress passed the [[Clayton Act]], which prohibited specific business actions (such as [[price discrimination]] and [[Tying (commerce)|tying]]) if they substantially lessened competition. At the same time Congress established the [[Federal Trade Commission]] (FTC), whose legal and business experts could force business to agree to \"[[consent decree]]s\", which provided an alternative mechanism to police antitrust.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nAmerican hostility to big business began to decrease after the Progressive Era.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} For example, [[Ford Motor Company]] dominated auto manufacturing, built millions of cheap cars that put America on wheels, and at the same time lowered prices, raised wages, and promoted manufacturing efficiency. [[Welfare capitalism]] made large companies an attractive place to work; new career paths opened up in middle management; local suppliers discovered that big corporations were big purchasers.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}  Talk of trust busting faded away. Under the leadership of [[Herbert Hoover]], the government in the 1920s promoted business cooperation, fostered the creation of self-policing trade associations, and made the FTC an ally of \"respectable business\".{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n[[File:ATF policy.jpg|thumb|The printing equipment company [[American Type Founders|ATF]] explicitly states in its 1923 manual that its goal is to 'discourage unhealthy competition' in the printing industry.]]\n\nDuring the New Deal, attempts were made to stop cutthroat competition.  The [[National Industrial Recovery Act]] (NIRA) was a short-lived program in 1933\u201335 designed to strengthen trade associations, and raise prices, profits and wages at the same time. The [[Robinson-Patman Act]] of 1936 sought to protect local retailers against the onslaught of the more efficient chain stores, by making it illegal to discount prices. To control big business, the New Deal policymakers preferred federal and state regulation \u2014controlling the rates and telephone services provided by AT&T, for example\u2014 and by building up countervailing power in the form of labor unions.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nThe antitrust environment of the 70's was dominated by the case ''[[History of IBM#1969: Antitrust, the Unbundling of software and services|United States v. IBM]]'', which was filed by the [[U.S. Justice Department]] in 1969. [[IBM]] at the time dominated the computer market through alleged bundling of software and hardware as well as sabotage at the sales level and false product announcements. It was one of the largest and certainly the lengthiest antitrust case the DoJ brought against a company. In 1982, the [[Reagan administration]] dismissed the case, and the costs and wasted resources were heavily criticized. However, contemporary economists argue that the legal pressure on IBM during that period allowed for the development of an independent software and personal computer industry with major importance for the national economy.<ref>Wu, Tim (2018) [http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-9997454-6-5 The Curse of Bigness: Antitrust in the New Gilded Age]. p. 110-113. Columbia Global Reports ({{ISBN|978-0-9997454-6-5}})</ref>\n\nIn 1982 the Reagan administration used the Sherman Act to break up AT&T into one long-distance company and seven regional \"[[Regional Bell Operating Company|Baby Bell]]s\", arguing that competition should replace monopoly for the benefit of consumers and the economy as a whole. The pace of business takeovers quickened in the 1990s, but whenever one large corporation sought to acquire another, it first had to obtain the approval of either the FTC, [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] or the Justice Department. Often the government demanded that certain subsidiaries be sold so that the new company would not monopolize a particular geographical market.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nIn 1999 a coalition of 19 states and the federal Justice Department sued [[Microsoft]].<ref name=\"Gavil_2014_Antitrust\">{{cite book |title=The Microsoft Antitrust Cases - Competition Policy for the Twenty-first Century |author-first1=Andrew I. |author-last1=Gavil |author-first2=Harry |author-last2=First |publisher=[[MIT Press]] |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA |date=2014-12-09 |isbn=978-0-262-02776-2 }}</ref> A highly publicized trial found that Microsoft had strong-armed many companies in an attempt to prevent competition from the [[Netscape]] browser.<ref>''United States v.

It does not capture the decisions of a single enterprise, or a single economic entity, even though the form of an entity may be two or more [[separate legal person]]s or companies. In ''[[Copperweld Corp. v. Independence Tube Corp.]]''<ref>{{ussc|467|752|1984}}</ref> it was held an agreement between a parent company and a [[wholly owned subsidiary]] could not be subject to antitrust law, because the decision took place within a single economic entity.<ref>cf [[AA Berle]], 'The Theory of Enterprise Entity' (1947) 47(3) Columbia Law Review 343, where the corollary is argued, that an enterprise ought to be responsible for the debts of each separate legal person within the economic group.</ref> This reflects the view that if the enterprise (as an economic entity) has not acquired a [[monopoly]] position, or has significant [[market power]], then no harm is done. The same rationale has been extended to [[joint ventures]], where corporate shareholders make a decision through a new company they form. In ''[[Texaco Inc. v. Dagher]]''<ref>{{ussc|547|1|2006}}</ref> the Supreme Court held unanimously that a price set by a joint venture between [[Texaco]] and [[Shell Oil]] did not count as making an unlawful agreement.

Independence Tube Corp.]]'', 467 U.S. 752, 768 (1984).</ref> Generally the law identifies four main categories of agreement. First, some agreements such as price fixing or sharing markets are automatically unlawful, or illegal ''[[illegal per se|per se]]''. Second, because the law does not seek to prohibit every kind of agreement that hinders [[freedom of contract]], it developed a \"[[rule of reason]]\" where a practice might restrict trade in a way that is seen as positive or beneficial for consumers or society. Third, significant problems of proof and identification of wrongdoing arise where businesses make no overt contact, or simply share information, but appear to act in concert. [[Tacit collusion]], particularly in concentrated markets with a small number of competitors or [[oligopolists]], have led to significant controversy over whether or not antitrust authorities should intervene. Fourth, vertical agreements between a business and a supplier or purchaser \"up\" or \"[[Downstream (manufacturing)|downstream]]\" raise concerns about the exercise of [[market power]], however they are generally subject to a more relaxed standard under the \"rule of reason\".\n\n===Restrictive practices===\n{{Slist illegal per se}}\n{{main|Illegal per se|Price fixing|Bid rigging|Market sharing|Group boycott}}\nSome practices are deemed by the courts to be so obviously detrimental that they are categorized as being automatically unlawful, or illegal ''[[illegal per se|per se]]''. The simplest and central case of this is [[price fixing]]. This involves an agreement by businesses to set the price or [[Consideration (law)|consideration]] of a good or service which they buy or sell from others at a specific level. If the agreement is durable, the general term for these businesses is a [[cartel]]. It is irrelevant whether or not the businesses succeed in increasing their profits, or whether together they reach the level of having [[market power]] as might a [[monopoly]]. Such collusion is illegal ''per se''.\n\n*''[[United States v. Trenton Potteries Co.]]'', {{ussc|273|392|1927}} per se illegality of [[price fixing]]\n*''[[Appalachian Coals, Inc. v.

[[Geographic market allocation]] is an agreement between competitors not to compete within each other's geographic territories.\n\n*''[[Addyston Pipe and Steel Co. v. United States]]''<ref>{{ussc|175|211|1899}}</ref> pipe manufacturers had agreed among themselves to designate one lowest bidder for government contracts. This was held to be an unlawful [[restraint of trade]] contrary to the Sherman Act. However, following the reasoning of Justice Taft in the Court of Appeals, the Supreme Court held that implicit in the Sherman Act \u00a71 there was a [[rule of reason]], so that not every agreement which restrained the [[freedom of contract]] of the parties would count as an anti-competitive violation.\n*''[[Hartford Fire Insurance Co. v.

The reason for this is that the courts have endeavoured to draw a line between practices that restrain trade in a \"good\" compared to a \"bad\" way. In the first case, ''[[United States v. Trans-Missouri Freight Association]]'',<ref>{{ussc|166|290|1897}}</ref> the Supreme Court found that railroad companies had acted unlawfully by setting up an organisation to fix transport prices. The railroads had protested that their intention was to keep prices low, not high. The court found that this was not true, but stated that not every \"restraint of trade\" in a literal sense could be unlawful. Just as under the common law, the restraint of trade had to be \"unreasonable\". In ''[[Chicago Board of Trade v. United States]]'' the Supreme Court found a \"good\" restraint of trade.<ref>{{ussc|246|231|1918}}</ref> The [[Chicago Board of Trade]] had a rule that [[commodities trader]]s were not allowed to privately agree to sell or buy after the market's closing time (and then finalise the deals when it opened the next day). The reason for the Board of Trade having this rule was to ensure that all traders had an equal chance to trade at a transparent market price. It plainly restricted trading, but the Chicago Board of Trade argued this was beneficial. Brandeis J., giving judgment for a unanimous Supreme Court, held the rule to be pro-competitive, and comply with the rule of reason. It did not violate the Sherman Act \u00a71. As he put it,\n\n{{quote|Every agreement concerning trade, every regulation of trade, restrains. To bind, to restrain, is of their very essence. The true test of legality is whether the restraint imposed is such as merely regulates and perhaps thereby promotes competition or whether it is such as may suppress or even destroy competition.

The law on [[public services]] and [[United States administrative law|administration]] goes significantly beyond the realm of antitrust law's treatment of monopolies. When enterprises are not under public ownership, and where regulation does not foreclose the application of antitrust law, two requirements must be shown for the offense of monopolization. First, the alleged monopolist must possess sufficient [[Market power|power]] in an accurately defined [[Market (economics)|market]] for its products or services. Second, the monopolist must have used its power in a prohibited way. The categories of prohibited conduct are not closed, and are contested in theory.

With no competition, they are then free to consolidate control of the industry and charge whatever prices they wish. At this point, there is also little motivation for investing in further [[technology|technological]] research, since there are no competitors left to gain an advantage over. High [[barriers to entry]] such as large upfront investment, notably named [[sunk costs]], requirements in infrastructure and exclusive agreements with distributors, customers, and wholesalers ensure that it will be difficult for any new competitors to enter the market, and that if any do, the trust will have ample advance warning and time in which to either buy the competitor out, or engage in its own research and return to [[predatory pricing]] long enough to force the competitor out of business. Critics argue that the empirical evidence shows that \"predatory pricing\" does not work in practice and is better defeated by a truly [[free market]] than by antitrust laws (see [[Predatory pricing#Criticism|Criticism of the theory of predatory pricing]]).\n\n*''[[Brooke Group Ltd. v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp.]]'', 509 U.S. 209 (1993) to prove predatory pricing the plaintiff must show that changes in market conditions are adverse to its interests, and that (1) prices are below an appropriate measure of its rival's costs, and (2) the competitor had a reasonable prospect or a \"dangerous probability\" of recouping its investment in the alleged scheme.\n*''[[Weyerhaeuser Company v.

This was seen as the \"Bill of Rights\" for labor, as the Act laid down that the \"labor of a human being is not a [[commodity]] or article of commerce\". The purpose was to ensure that employees with [[unequal bargaining power]] were not prevented from combining in the same way that their employers could combine in [[corporations]],<ref>See the [[National Labor Relations Act 1935]] \u00a71</ref> subject to the restrictions on mergers that the Clayton Act set out. However, sufficiently autonomous workers, such as professional sports players have been held to fall within antitrust provisions.<ref>See ''[[American Needle, Inc. v.

Mergers and joint agreements of professional football, hockey, baseball, and basketball leagues are exempt.<ref>{{UnitedStatesCode|15|1291}} ''[[et seq]]''</ref> [[Major League Baseball]] was held to be broadly exempt from antitrust law in ''[[Federal Baseball Club v. National League]]''.<ref>{{ussc|259|200|1922}}</ref> Holmes J held that the baseball league's organization meant that there was no commerce between the states taking place, even though teams traveled across state lines to put on the games. That travel was merely incidental to a business which took place in each state. It was subsequently held in 1952 in ''[[Toolson v.

However Congress had accepted it, and favored it, so retroactively overruling the exemption was no longer a matter for the courts, but the legislature. In ''[[United States v. International Boxing Club of New York]]'',<ref>{{ussc|348|236|1955}}</ref> it was held that, unlike baseball, boxing was not exempt, and in ''Radovich v. National Football League (NFL)'',<ref>{{ussc|352|445|1957}}</ref> professional football is generally subject to antitrust laws. As a result of the [[AFL-NFL merger]], the [[National Football League]] was also given exemptions in exchange for certain conditions, such as not directly competing with college or high school football.<ref>{{UnitedStatesCode|15|1292}}, {{UnitedStatesCode|15|1293}}, ''[[et seq]]''</ref> However, the 2010 Supreme Court ruling in [[American Needle, Inc. v.

The historical policy has been to use the state's licensing powers over the airwaves to promote plurality. Antitrust laws do not prevent companies from using the legal system or political process to attempt to reduce competition.

Such proceedings may be by way of petition setting forth the case and praying that such violation shall be enjoined or otherwise prohibited. When the parties complained of shall have been duly notified of such petition the court shall proceed, as soon as may be, to the hearing and determination of the case; and pending such petition and before final decree, the court may at any time make such temporary restraining order or prohibition as shall be deemed [[Justice|just]] in the premises.|source= \u2014[[Sherman Act 1890]] \u00a7[https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/4 4]}}\n\nThe remedies for violations of U.S. antitrust laws are as broad as any [[equitable remedy]] that a court has the power to make, as well as being able to impose penalties. When private parties have suffered an actionable loss, they may claim compensation. Under the [[Sherman Act 1890]] \u00a77, these may be trebled, a measure to encourage private litigation to enforce the laws and act as a deterrent. The courts may award penalties under \u00a7\u00a71 and 2, which are measured according to the size of the company or the business. In their inherent jurisdiction to prevent violations in future, the courts have additionally exercised the power to break up businesses into competing parts under different owners, although this remedy has rarely been exercised (examples include ''[[Standard Oil]]'', ''[[Northern Securities Company]]'', ''[[American Tobacco Company]]'', ''[[AT&T Corporation]]'' and, although reversed on appeal, ''[[Microsoft]]''). Three levels of enforcement come from the Federal government, primarily through the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission, the governments of states, and private parties.

Thus, if a company is sued for monopolizing a market and the jury concludes the conduct resulted in consumers' being overcharged $200,000, that amount will automatically be tripled, so the injured consumers will receive $600,000.

It could have, for example, required violators to compensate federal, state, and local governments for the estimated damage to their respective economies caused by the violations. But, this remedy was not selected. Instead, Congress chose to permit all persons to sue to recover three times their actual damages every time they were injured in their business or property by an antitrust violation.

In his essay entitled ''Antitrust,'' he says: \"No one will ever know what new products, processes, machines, and cost-saving mergers failed to come into existence, killed by the Sherman Act before they were born. No one can ever compute the price that all of us have paid for that Act which, by inducing less effective use of capital, has kept our standard of living lower than would otherwise have been possible.\" Those, like Greenspan, who oppose antitrust tend not to support competition as an end in itself but for its results\u2014low prices. As long as a monopoly is not a [[coercive monopoly]] where a firm is securely insulated from ''potential'' competition, it is argued that the firm must keep prices low in order to discourage competition from arising.

The main statutes are the [[Sherman Act of 1890]], the [[Clayton Act of 1914]] and the [[Federal Trade Commission Act of 1914]]. These Acts serve three major functions. First, Section 1 of the Sherman Act prohibits price-fixing and the operation of [[cartel]]s, and prohibits other collusive practices that unreasonably restrain trade. Second, Section 7 of the Clayton Act restricts the [[mergers and acquisitions]] of organizations that would likely substantially lessen competition. Third, Section 2 of the Sherman Act prohibits the abuse of monopoly power.<ref>For a general framework, see Thibault Schrepel, A New Structured Rule of Reason Approach for High-Tech Markets, Suffolk University Law Review, Vol. 50, No. 1, 2017 at https://ssrn.com/abstract=2908838</ref>\n\nFederal antitrust laws provide for both civil and criminal enforcement of antitrust laws. The [[Federal Trade Commission]], the [[United States Department of Justice Antitrust Division|Antitrust Division]] of the [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Department of Justice]], and private parties who are sufficiently affected may all bring civil actions in the courts to enforce the antitrust laws. However, criminal antitrust enforcement is done only by the Justice Department. U.S. states also have antitrust statutes that govern commerce occurring solely within their state borders.\n\nThe scope of antitrust laws, and the degree to which they should interfere in an enterprise's freedom to conduct business, or to protect smaller businesses, communities and consumers, are strongly debated. One view, mostly closely associated with the \"[[Chicago School of economics]]\" suggests that antitrust laws should focus solely on the benefits to consumers and overall efficiency, while a broad range of legal and economic theory sees the role of antitrust laws as also controlling [[economic power]] in the public interest.<ref>See generally [[Herbert Hovenkamp]], 'Chicago and Its Alternatives' (1986) 6 Duke Law Journal 1014\u20131029, and [[RH Bork]], ''[[The Antitrust Paradox]]'' (Free Press 1993.)</ref>\n\n==History==\n{{main|History of United States antitrust law|History of competition law}}\n\n{{Refimprove section|date=May 2017}}\n\nAlthough \"[[Trust law|trust]]\" has a specific legal meaning (where one person holds property for the benefit of another), in the late 19th century the word was commonly used to denote big business, because that legal instrument was frequently used to effect a combination of companies.<ref>For example, the Standard Oil Trust was formed in 1882 to combine the Standard Oil Company and a number of other companies that were engaged in producing, refining, and marketing oil. Under the Standard Oil Trust Agreement, the companies transferred their stock \"in trust\" to nine trustees headed by [[John D. Rockefeller]] and in exchange received a beneficial interest in the trust. Eventually, the trustees governed some 40 corporations, of which the trust wholly owned 14. In 1899, however, the trust renamed its New Jersey firm Standard Oil Company (New Jersey) and incorporated it as a holding company. All assets and interests formerly grouped in the trust were then transferred to the New Jersey company. Because of Standard Oil's monopolistic conduct, in 1911 the Supreme Court, in ''[[Standard Oil Co. v. United States]]'', ordered the break-up of the business organization. The New Jersey company was ordered to divest itself of its major holdings\u201433 companies in all.

People for strong antitrust laws argued that, in order for the American economy to be successful, it would require free competition and the opportunity for individual Americans to build their own businesses. As Senator [[John Sherman (politician)|John Sherman]] put it, \"If we will not endure a king as a political power we should not endure a king over the production, transportation, and sale of any of the necessaries of life.\" Congress passed the [[Sherman Antitrust Act]] almost unanimously in 1890, and it remains the core of antitrust policy. The Act prohibits agreements in restraint of trade and abuse of monopoly power. It gives the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] the mandate to go to federal court for orders to stop illegal behavior or to impose remedies.<ref>Since the passage of the Federal Trade Commission Act in 1914, the [[Federal Trade Commission|FTC]] has had power to enforce section 1 of the Sherman Act administratively, under the rubric of section 5 of the FTC Act, 15 U.S.C. sec. 45. See generally [[FTC v. Sperry & Hutchinson Trading Stamp Co.]] As that Supreme Court decision explains, the FTC also has authority to act against incipient Sherman Act violations and violations of its \"spirit.\"</ref>{{original research inline|date=May 2017}}\n\nPublic officials during the [[Progressive Era]] put passing and enforcing strong antitrust high on their agenda. President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] sued 45 companies under the Sherman Act, while [[William Howard Taft]] sued almost 90. In 1902, Roosevelt stopped the formation of the [[Northern Securities Company]], which threatened to monopolize transportation in the Northwest (see ''[[Northern Securities Co. v. United States]]'').\n\n[[File:Standard Oil.jpg|thumb|right|[[Standard Oil]] (Refinery No. 1 in [[Cleveland]], [[Ohio]], pictured) was a major company broken up under United States antitrust laws.]]\nOne of the better-known trusts was the [[Standard Oil|Standard Oil Company]]; [[John D. Rockefeller]] in the 1870s and 1880s had used economic threats against competitors and secret rebate deals with railroads to build what was called a monopoly in the oil business, though some minor competitors remained in business. In 1911 the Supreme Court agreed that in recent years (1900\u20131904) Standard had violated the Sherman Act (see ''[[Standard Oil Co. of New Jersey v. United States]]''). It broke the monopoly into three dozen separate companies that competed with one another, including Standard Oil of New Jersey (later known as [[Exxon]] and now [[ExxonMobil]]), Standard Oil of Indiana ([[Amoco]]), Standard Oil Company of New York ([[Mobil]], again, later merged with Exxon to form ExxonMobil), of California ([[Chevron Corporation|Chevron]]), Cleveland-based [[Standard Oil of Ohio| SOHIO]] - the parent of the trust, and so on. In approving the breakup the Supreme Court added the \"rule of reason\": not all big companies, and not all monopolies, are evil; and the courts (not the executive branch) are to make that decision. To be harmful, a trust had to somehow damage the economic environment of its competitors.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\n[[U.S. Steel|United States Steel Corporation]], which was much larger than Standard Oil, won its antitrust suit in 1920 despite never having delivered the benefits to consumers that Standard Oil did.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} In fact, it lobbied for tariff protection that reduced competition, and so contending that it was one of the \"good trusts\" that benefited the economy is somewhat doubtful.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} Likewise [[International Harvester]] survived its court test, while other monopolies were broken up in [[tobacco]], meatpacking, and bathtub fixtures. Over the years hundreds of executives of competing companies who met together illegally to fix prices went to federal prison.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nIn 1914 Congress passed the [[Clayton Act]], which prohibited specific business actions (such as [[price discrimination]] and [[Tying (commerce)|tying]]) if they substantially lessened competition. At the same time Congress established the [[Federal Trade Commission]] (FTC), whose legal and business experts could force business to agree to \"[[consent decree]]s\", which provided an alternative mechanism to police antitrust.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nAmerican hostility to big business began to decrease after the Progressive Era.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}} For example, [[Ford Motor Company]] dominated auto manufacturing, built millions of cheap cars that put America on wheels, and at the same time lowered prices, raised wages, and promoted manufacturing efficiency. [[Welfare capitalism]] made large companies an attractive place to work; new career paths opened up in middle management; local suppliers discovered that big corporations were big purchasers.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}  Talk of trust busting faded away. Under the leadership of [[Herbert Hoover]], the government in the 1920s promoted business cooperation, fostered the creation of self-policing trade associations, and made the FTC an ally of \"respectable business\".{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n[[File:ATF policy.jpg|thumb|The printing equipment company [[American Type Founders|ATF]] explicitly states in its 1923 manual that its goal is to 'discourage unhealthy competition' in the printing industry.]]\n\nDuring the New Deal, attempts were made to stop cutthroat competition.  The [[National Industrial Recovery Act]] (NIRA) was a short-lived program in 1933\u201335 designed to strengthen trade associations, and raise prices, profits and wages at the same time. The [[Robinson-Patman Act]] of 1936 sought to protect local retailers against the onslaught of the more efficient chain stores, by making it illegal to discount prices. To control big business, the New Deal policymakers preferred federal and state regulation \u2014controlling the rates and telephone services provided by AT&T, for example\u2014 and by building up countervailing power in the form of labor unions.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nThe antitrust environment of the 70's was dominated by the case ''[[History of IBM#1969: Antitrust, the Unbundling of software and services|United States v. IBM]]'', which was filed by the [[U.S. Justice Department]] in 1969. [[IBM]] at the time dominated the computer market through alleged bundling of software and hardware as well as sabotage at the sales level and false product announcements. It was one of the largest and certainly the lengthiest antitrust case the DoJ brought against a company. In 1982, the [[Reagan administration]] dismissed the case, and the costs and wasted resources were heavily criticized. However, contemporary economists argue that the legal pressure on IBM during that period allowed for the development of an independent software and personal computer industry with major importance for the national economy.<ref>Wu, Tim (2018) [http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-9997454-6-5 The Curse of Bigness: Antitrust in the New Gilded Age]. p. 110-113. Columbia Global Reports ({{ISBN|978-0-9997454-6-5}})</ref>\n\nIn 1982 the Reagan administration used the Sherman Act to break up AT&T into one long-distance company and seven regional \"[[Regional Bell Operating Company|Baby Bell]]s\", arguing that competition should replace monopoly for the benefit of consumers and the economy as a whole. The pace of business takeovers quickened in the 1990s, but whenever one large corporation sought to acquire another, it first had to obtain the approval of either the FTC, [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] or the Justice Department. Often the government demanded that certain subsidiaries be sold so that the new company would not monopolize a particular geographical market.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}\n\nIn 1999 a coalition of 19 states and the federal Justice Department sued [[Microsoft]].<ref name=\"Gavil_2014_Antitrust\">{{cite book |title=The Microsoft Antitrust Cases - Competition Policy for the Twenty-first Century |author-first1=Andrew I. |author-last1=Gavil |author-first2=Harry |author-last2=First |publisher=[[MIT Press]] |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts, USA |date=2014-12-09 |isbn=978-0-262-02776-2 }}</ref> A highly publicized trial found that Microsoft had strong-armed many companies in an attempt to prevent competition from the [[Netscape]] browser.<ref>''United States v.

It reflects the view that each business has a duty to act independently on the market, and so earn its profits solely by providing better priced and quality products than its competitors.\n[[restraint of trade]]\n\n The Sherman Act \u00a71 prohibits \"[e]very contract, combination in the form of trust or otherwise, or conspiracy, in restraint of trade or commerce.\"<ref>{{USC|15|1}}.</ref> This targets two or more distinct enterprises acting together in a way that harms third parties. It does not capture the decisions of a single enterprise, or a single economic entity, even though the form of an entity may be two or more [[separate legal person]]s or companies. In ''[[Copperweld Corp. v. Independence Tube Corp.]]''<ref>{{ussc|467|752|1984}}</ref> it was held an agreement between a parent company and a [[wholly owned subsidiary]] could not be subject to antitrust law, because the decision took place within a single economic entity.<ref>cf [[AA Berle]], 'The Theory of Enterprise Entity' (1947) 47(3) Columbia Law Review 343, where the corollary is argued, that an enterprise ought to be responsible for the debts of each separate legal person within the economic group.</ref> This reflects the view that if the enterprise (as an economic entity) has not acquired a [[monopoly]] position, or has significant [[market power]], then no harm is done. The same rationale has been extended to [[joint ventures]], where corporate shareholders make a decision through a new company they form. In ''[[Texaco Inc. v. Dagher]]''<ref>{{ussc|547|1|2006}}</ref> the Supreme Court held unanimously that a price set by a joint venture between [[Texaco]] and [[Shell Oil]] did not count as making an unlawful agreement. Thus the law draws a \"basic distinction between concerted and independent action\".<ref>[[PE Areeda]], ''Antitrust Law'' (1986) \u00a7 1436c</ref> Multi-firm conduct tends to be seen as more likely than single-firm conduct to have an unambiguously negative effect and \"is judged more sternly\".<ref>''[[Copperweld Corp. v. Independence Tube Corp.]]'', 467 U.S. 752, 768 (1984).</ref> Generally the law identifies four main categories of agreement. First, some agreements such as price fixing or sharing markets are automatically unlawful, or illegal ''[[illegal per se|per se]]''. Second, because the law does not seek to prohibit every kind of agreement that hinders [[freedom of contract]], it developed a \"[[rule of reason]]\" where a practice might restrict trade in a way that is seen as positive or beneficial for consumers or society. Third, significant problems of proof and identification of wrongdoing arise where businesses make no overt contact, or simply share information, but appear to act in concert. [[Tacit collusion]], particularly in concentrated markets with a small number of competitors or [[oligopolists]], have led to significant controversy over whether or not antitrust authorities should intervene. Fourth, vertical agreements between a business and a supplier or purchaser \"up\" or \"[[Downstream (manufacturing)|downstream]]\" raise concerns about the exercise of [[market power]], however they are generally subject to a more relaxed standard under the \"rule of reason\".\n\n===Restrictive practices===\n{{Slist illegal per se}}\n{{main|Illegal per se|Price fixing|Bid rigging|Market sharing|Group boycott}}\nSome practices are deemed by the courts to be so obviously detrimental that they are categorized as being automatically unlawful, or illegal ''[[illegal per se|per se]]''. The simplest and central case of this is [[price fixing]]. This involves an agreement by businesses to set the price or [[Consideration (law)|consideration]] of a good or service which they buy or sell from others at a specific level. If the agreement is durable, the general term for these businesses is a [[cartel]]. It is irrelevant whether or not the businesses succeed in increasing their profits, or whether together they reach the level of having [[market power]] as might a [[monopoly]]. Such collusion is illegal ''per se''.\n\n*''[[United States v. Trenton Potteries Co.]]'', {{ussc|273|392|1927}} per se illegality of [[price fixing]]\n*''[[Appalachian Coals, Inc. v. United States]]'', {{ussc|288|344|1933}}\n*''[[United States v. Socony-Vacuum Oil Co.]]'', {{ussc|310|150|1940}}\n\n[[Bid rigging]] is a form of price fixing and market allocation that involves an agreement in which one party of a group of bidders will be designated to win the bid. [[Geographic market allocation]] is an agreement between competitors not to compete within each other's geographic territories.\n\n*''[[Addyston Pipe and Steel Co. v. United States]]''<ref>{{ussc|175|211|1899}}</ref> pipe manufacturers had agreed among themselves to designate one lowest bidder for government contracts. This was held to be an unlawful [[restraint of trade]] contrary to the Sherman Act. However, following the reasoning of Justice Taft in the Court of Appeals, the Supreme Court held that implicit in the Sherman Act \u00a71 there was a [[rule of reason]], so that not every agreement which restrained the [[freedom of contract]] of the parties would count as an anti-competitive violation.\n*''[[Hartford Fire Insurance Co. v. California]]'', 113 S.Ct. 2891 (1993) 5 to 4, a group of reinsurance companies acting in London were successfully sued by California for conspiring to make U.S. insurance companies abandon policies beneficial to consumers, but costly to reinsure.

FTC]]'', 312 U.S. 457 (1941) the FOGA, a combination of clothes designers, agreed not to sell their clothes to shops which stocked replicas of their designs, and employed their own inspectors. Held to violate the Sherman Act \u00a71\n*''[[Klor's, Inc. v. Broadway-Hale Stores, Inc.]]'', 359 U.S. 207 (1959) a group boycott is per se unlawful, even if it may be connected with a private dispute, and will have little effect upon the markets\n*''[[American Medical Association v.

Pacific Stationery]]'', 472 U.S. 284 (1985) it was not ''per se'' unlawful for the Northwest Wholesale Stationers, a purchasing co-operative where Pacific Stationery had been a member, to expel Pacific Stationery without any procedure or hearing or reason. Whether there were competitive effects would have to be adjudged under the rule of reason.\n*''[[NYNEX Corp. v. Discon, Inc.]]'', 525 U.S. 128 (1998) the per se group boycott prohibition does not apply to a buyer's decision to purchase goods from one seller or another\n\n===Rule of reason===\n{{Slist rule of reason}}\n{{main|Rule of reason}}\nIf an antitrust claim does not fall within a ''per se'' illegal category, the plaintiff must show the conduct causes harm in \"restraint of trade\" under the Sherman Act \u00a71 according to \"the facts peculiar to the business to which the restraint is applied\".<ref>''[[Chicago Board of Trade]]'', 246 U.S. 231, 244 (1918)</ref> This essentially means that unless a plaintiff can point to a clear precedent, to which the situation is analogous, proof of an anti-competitive effect is more difficult. The reason for this is that the courts have endeavoured to draw a line between practices that restrain trade in a \"good\" compared to a \"bad\" way. In the first case, ''[[United States v. Trans-Missouri Freight Association]]'',<ref>{{ussc|166|290|1897}}</ref> the Supreme Court found that railroad companies had acted unlawfully by setting up an organisation to fix transport prices. The railroads had protested that their intention was to keep prices low, not high. The court found that this was not true, but stated that not every \"restraint of trade\" in a literal sense could be unlawful. Just as under the common law, the restraint of trade had to be \"unreasonable\". In ''[[Chicago Board of Trade v. United States]]'' the Supreme Court found a \"good\" restraint of trade.<ref>{{ussc|246|231|1918}}</ref> The [[Chicago Board of Trade]] had a rule that [[commodities trader]]s were not allowed to privately agree to sell or buy after the market's closing time (and then finalise the deals when it opened the next day). The reason for the Board of Trade having this rule was to ensure that all traders had an equal chance to trade at a transparent market price. It plainly restricted trading, but the Chicago Board of Trade argued this was beneficial. Brandeis J., giving judgment for a unanimous Supreme Court, held the rule to be pro-competitive, and comply with the rule of reason. It did not violate the Sherman Act \u00a71. As he put it,\n\n{{quote|Every agreement concerning trade, every regulation of trade, restrains. To bind, to restrain, is of their very essence. The true test of legality is whether the restraint imposed is such as merely regulates and perhaps thereby promotes competition or whether it is such as may suppress or even destroy competition. To determine that question, the court must ordinarily consider the facts peculiar to the business to which the restraint is applied, its condition before and after the restraint was imposed, the nature of the restraint, and its effect, actual or probable.<ref>''[[Board of Trade of the City of Chicago v.

The law on [[public services]] and [[United States administrative law|administration]] goes significantly beyond the realm of antitrust law's treatment of monopolies. When enterprises are not under public ownership, and where regulation does not foreclose the application of antitrust law, two requirements must be shown for the offense of monopolization. First, the alleged monopolist must possess sufficient [[Market power|power]] in an accurately defined [[Market (economics)|market]] for its products or services. Second, the monopolist must have used its power in a prohibited way. The categories of prohibited conduct are not closed, and are contested in theory.

With no competition, they are then free to consolidate control of the industry and charge whatever prices they wish. At this point, there is also little motivation for investing in further [[technology|technological]] research, since there are no competitors left to gain an advantage over. High [[barriers to entry]] such as large upfront investment, notably named [[sunk costs]], requirements in infrastructure and exclusive agreements with distributors, customers, and wholesalers ensure that it will be difficult for any new competitors to enter the market, and that if any do, the trust will have ample advance warning and time in which to either buy the competitor out, or engage in its own research and return to [[predatory pricing]] long enough to force the competitor out of business. Critics argue that the empirical evidence shows that \"predatory pricing\" does not work in practice and is better defeated by a truly [[free market]] than by antitrust laws (see [[Predatory pricing#Criticism|Criticism of the theory of predatory pricing]]).\n\n*''[[Brooke Group Ltd. v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp.]]'', 509 U.S. 209 (1993) to prove predatory pricing the plaintiff must show that changes in market conditions are adverse to its interests, and that (1) prices are below an appropriate measure of its rival's costs, and (2) the competitor had a reasonable prospect or a \"dangerous probability\" of recouping its investment in the alleged scheme.\n*''[[Weyerhaeuser Company v.

This was seen as the \"Bill of Rights\" for labor, as the Act laid down that the \"labor of a human being is not a [[commodity]] or article of commerce\". The purpose was to ensure that employees with [[unequal bargaining power]] were not prevented from combining in the same way that their employers could combine in [[corporations]],<ref>See the [[National Labor Relations Act 1935]] \u00a71</ref> subject to the restrictions on mergers that the Clayton Act set out. However, sufficiently autonomous workers, such as professional sports players have been held to fall within antitrust provisions.<ref>See ''[[American Needle, Inc. v.

Mergers and joint agreements of professional football, hockey, baseball, and basketball leagues are exempt.<ref>{{UnitedStatesCode|15|1291}} ''[[et seq]]''</ref> [[Major League Baseball]] was held to be broadly exempt from antitrust law in ''[[Federal Baseball Club v. National League]]''.<ref>{{ussc|259|200|1922}}</ref> Holmes J held that the baseball league's organization meant that there was no commerce between the states taking place, even though teams traveled across state lines to put on the games. That travel was merely incidental to a business which took place in each state. It was subsequently held in 1952 in ''[[Toolson v. New York Yankees]]'',<ref>{{ussc|346|356|1952}}</ref> and then again in 1972 ''[[Flood v. Kuhn]]'',<ref>{{ussc|407|258|1972}}</ref> that the baseball league's exemption was an \"aberration\". However Congress had accepted it, and favored it, so retroactively overruling the exemption was no longer a matter for the courts, but the legislature. In ''[[United States v. International Boxing Club of New York]]'',<ref>{{ussc|348|236|1955}}</ref> it was held that, unlike baseball, boxing was not exempt, and in ''Radovich v. National Football League (NFL)'',<ref>{{ussc|352|445|1957}}</ref> professional football is generally subject to antitrust laws. As a result of the [[AFL-NFL merger]], the [[National Football League]] was also given exemptions in exchange for certain conditions, such as not directly competing with college or high school football.<ref>{{UnitedStatesCode|15|1292}}, {{UnitedStatesCode|15|1293}}, ''[[et seq]]''</ref> However, the 2010 Supreme Court ruling in [[American Needle, Inc. v.

Newspapers under joint operating agreements are allowed limited antitrust immunity under the [[Newspaper Preservation Act of 1970]].<ref>{{UnitedStatesCode|15|1801}}, ''[[et seq]]''</ref> More generally, and partly because of concerns about [[media cross-ownership in the United States]], regulation of media is subject to specific statutes, chiefly the [[Communications Act of 1934]] and the [[Telecommunications Act of 1996]], under the guidance of the [[Federal Communications Commission]]. The historical policy has been to use the state's licensing powers over the airwaves to promote plurality. Antitrust laws do not prevent companies from using the legal system or political process to attempt to reduce competition. Most of these activities are considered legal under the [[Noerr-Pennington doctrine]]. Also, regulations by states may be immune under the [[Parker v.

When private parties have suffered an actionable loss, they may claim compensation. Under the [[Sherman Act 1890]] \u00a77, these may be trebled, a measure to encourage private litigation to enforce the laws and act as a deterrent. The courts may award penalties under \u00a7\u00a71 and 2, which are measured according to the size of the company or the business. In their inherent jurisdiction to prevent violations in future, the courts have additionally exercised the power to break up businesses into competing parts under different owners, although this remedy has rarely been exercised (examples include ''[[Standard Oil]]'', ''[[Northern Securities Company]]'', ''[[American Tobacco Company]]'', ''[[AT&T Corporation]]'' and, although reversed on appeal, ''[[Microsoft]]''). Three levels of enforcement come from the Federal government, primarily through the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission, the governments of states, and private parties. Public enforcement of antitrust laws is seen as important, given the cost, complexity and daunting task for private parties to bring litigation, particularly against large corporations.\n\n===Federal government===\n[[File:U.S. Department of Justice headquarters, August 12, 2006.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.15|Along with the [[Federal Trade Commission]] the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] is the public enforcer of [[antitrust]] law.]]\n[[File:ApexBuildingHighsmith.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.15|[[Federal Trade Commission]] building, view from southeast]]\n\nThe federal government, via both the [[United States Department of Justice Antitrust Division|Antitrust Division]] of the [[United States Department of Justice]] and the [[Federal Trade Commission]], can bring [[civil lawsuit]]s enforcing the laws.

Federal antitrust laws, as well as most state laws, provide for triple damages against antitrust violators in order to encourage private lawsuit enforcement of antitrust law. Thus, if a company is sued for monopolizing a market and the jury concludes the conduct resulted in consumers' being overcharged $200,000, that amount will automatically be tripled, so the injured consumers will receive $600,000. The United States Supreme Court summarized why Congress authorized private antitrust lawsuits in the case ''[[Hawaii v. Standard Oil Co. of Cal.]]'', 405 U.S. 251, 262 (1972):\n\n{{quote|Every violation of the antitrust laws is a blow to the free-enterprise system envisaged by Congress. This system depends on strong competition for its health and vigor, and strong competition depends, in turn, on compliance with antitrust legislation. In enacting these laws, Congress had many means at its disposal to penalize violators. It could have, for example, required violators to compensate federal, state, and local governments for the estimated damage to their respective economies caused by the violations. But, this remedy was not selected. Instead, Congress chose to permit all persons to sue to recover three times their actual damages every time they were injured in their business or property by an antitrust violation. By offering potential litigants the prospect of a recovery in three times the amount of their damages, Congress encouraged these persons to serve as \"private attorneys general\".}}\n\n*''[[Pfizer, Inc. v.

In his essay entitled ''Antitrust,'' he says: \"No one will ever know what new products, processes, machines, and cost-saving mergers failed to come into existence, killed by the Sherman Act before they were born. No one can ever compute the price that all of us have paid for that Act which, by inducing less effective use of capital, has kept our standard of living lower than would otherwise have been possible.\" Those, like Greenspan, who oppose antitrust tend not to support competition as an end in itself but for its results\u2014low prices. As long as a monopoly is not a [[coercive monopoly]] where a firm is securely insulated from ''potential'' competition, it is argued that the firm must keep prices low in order to discourage competition from arising.

In such a monopoly, the monopolist is able to make pricing and production decisions without an eye on competitive market forces and is able to curtail production to [[price-gouge]] consumers. Laissez-faire advocates argue that such a monopoly can only come about through the use of physical coercion or fraudulent means by the corporation or by government intervention and that there is no case of a coercive monopoly ever existing that was not the result of government policies.\n\nJudge [[Robert Bork]]'s writings on antitrust law (particularly ''[[The Antitrust Paradox]]''), along with those of [[Richard Posner]] and other [[law and economics]] thinkers, were heavily influential in causing a shift in the U.S. Supreme Court's approach to antitrust laws since the 1970s, to be focused solely on what is best for the consumer rather than the company's practices.<ref name=\"'70s 327\">{{Cite book|title= How We Got Here: The '70s|last= Frum|first= David|authorlink= David Frum|year= 2000|publisher= Basic Books|location= New York, New York|isbn= 0-465-04195-7|page= [https://archive.org/details/howwegothere70sd00frum/page/327 327]|url= https://archive.org/details/howwegothere70sd00frum/page/327}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{div col }}\n*[[Thurman Arnold]]\n*[[Barton\u2013Rush Bill]], a proposed franchise competition bill\n*Commissioner [[Andrew L.
