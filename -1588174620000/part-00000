As a young boy, Fulk was sent to the court of King [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] (1154\u20131189), where he grew up with the king's younger son, the future King [[John of England|John]] (1199\u20131216). John became his enemy after a childhood quarrel during a game of chess. As an adult, King John retained his animosity toward Fulk whom he stripped of his ancestral holdings. Fulk thereupon took to the woods as an outlaw and lived a life of adventure. The story may in fact  have confused aspects of the lives of two FitzWarins, Fulk I (d. 1171) and Fulk II (d. 1197), father and son. The romance of Fulk FitzWarin is noted for its parallels to the legend of [[Robin Hood]].<ref>Introduction to ''Fouke le Fitz Waryn'', edited by Stephen Knight and Thomas H.

As a young boy, Fulk was sent to the court of King [[Henry II of England|Henry II]] (1154\u20131189), where he grew up with the king's younger son, the future King [[John of England|John]] (1199\u20131216). John became his enemy after a childhood quarrel during a game of chess. As an adult, King John retained his animosity toward Fulk whom he stripped of his ancestral holdings. Fulk thereupon took to the woods as an outlaw and lived a life of adventure. The story may in fact  have confused aspects of the lives of two FitzWarins, Fulk I (d. 1171) and Fulk II (d. 1197), father and son. The romance of Fulk FitzWarin is noted for its parallels to the legend of [[Robin Hood]].<ref>Introduction to ''Fouke le Fitz Waryn'', edited by Stephen Knight and Thomas H.

{"title_page": "Karl Meissner", "text_new": "{{For|the Swiss botanist|Carl Meissner}}\n[[Image:KarlWilhelmMeissner.jpg|right|thumb|200px|Karl Meissner]]\n'''Karl Wilhelm Meissner''' (December 15, 1891 in [[Reutlingen]], [[W\u00fcrttemberg]] &ndash; April 13, 1959 on a cruise ship sailing to Europe) was a German-American [[physicist]] specializing in hyperfine [[spectroscopy]].  He spent the greater part of his career in the United States at [[Purdue University]], in [[West Lafayette, Indiana]].\n\n==Education==\n\nAfter Meissner\u2019s [[abitur]] at the ''Humanistisches [[Gymnasium (school)|Gymnasium]]'', in 1910, he began the study of physics and mathematics at [[University of T\u00fcbingen]].  After three terms, he went to the [[University of Munich]] as a student of the experimentalist [[Wilhelm R\u00f6ntgen]] and the theoretician [[Arnold Sommerfeld]].<ref>K. W. Meissner reviews: Arnold Sommerfeld, translated from the first German edition by [[Otto Laporte]] and Peter A. Moldauer ''Optics - Lectures on Theoretical Physics Volume IV''.  ''American Journal of Physics'' '''23''' (7) 477-478 (1955).  The author states that he attended Sommerfeld\u2019s lectures, and specifically on optics, in 1912.  Sommerfeld taught each of the six subjects (mechanics, mechanics of deformable bodies, electrodynamics, optics, thermodynamics and statistical mechanics, and partial differential equations in physics) in the length of a semester.</ref> After one year at Munich, he returned to T\u00fcbingen to be able to study [[spectroscopy]] with [[Friedrich Paschen]].  While still a student in 1914, Meissner was able to prove the existence of oxygen lines in the [[Sun|solar]] spectrum.  He was awarded his doctorate in 1915, on a thesis with the title ''Interferometrische Wellenl\u00e4ngenbestimmung im infraroten Spektralbereich''.<ref>Translation from the German:  ''Interferometric wavelength regulation in the infrared spectral region''.</ref>  In 1916 he became an assistant to Edgar Meyer<ref>[http://physics.syr.edu/~rsholmes/genealogy.html Edgar Meyer] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070208073557/http://physics.syr.edu/~rsholmes/genealogy.html |date=2007-02-08 }} \u2013 Biographical Information</ref> at the [[University of Zurich]], under whom he completed his [[Habilitation]], in 1918, with the [[Habilitationsschrift]] title ''Untersuchungen des Neonspektrums''.<ref>Translation from the German: ''Investigations of the neon spectrum''.</ref>  The following year, he married the Polish physicist Doctor Janka Kohn.<ref name=\"Karl Meissner\">[http://www.physik.uni-frankfurt.de/paf/paf112.html Karl Meissner] \u2013 University of Frankfurt</ref>\n\n==Career==\n\nIn the summer of 1924, Meissner became a First Assistant at the Physics Institute of the [[University of Zurich]].  Here he studied the spectra of indium, gallium, neon, argon, and caesium, the arc spectrum of lead (spectrum of neutral or non-ionized lead), the [[Stark effect]] of neon, and general problems of detecting radiation.<ref name=\"Karl Meissner\"/>\n\nThe change from Zurich to the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University of Frankfurt am Main]] occurred in 1925.  Meissner was appointed extraordinarius professor of physics there, when [[Walter Gerlach]] left for the University of T\u00fcbingen.  Shortly thereafter, he received calls to the Donro Institute at Davos and the ''Physikalisch Technische Reichsanstalt'' in Berlin; he declined both.  After the retirement of Martin Brendel and with the support of Richard Wachsmuth, Meissner was appointed ordinarius professor of astronomy and director of the University\u2019s observatory.  Upon retirement of Wachsmuth, Meissner was appointed as his successor to the chair for astronomy and director of the astronomy institute in 1932.<ref name=\"Karl Meissner\"/>\n\nSpectral lines are broadened due to random movements and collisions of the emitting atoms; this limits resolution.  To reduce these broadening mechanism, Meissner, with K. F. Luft and independently of R. Minkowski and H. Bruck, in 1935, developed the technique of observing particle beams perpendicular to their direction of flow.<ref>\nR. Minkowski and H. Bruck, ''Zeits. f. Physik'' '''95''' 284 (1935).  K. W. Meissner and K. F. Luft, ''Ann. d. Physik'' '''28''' 667 (1937).</ref>  With this technique, Meissner could investigate the hyperfine structure of spectra, which are due to the magnetic moment of the atomic nuclei. This is an area of experimental research which would occupy Meissner for many years.<ref name=\"Karl Meissner\"/>\n\nMeissner\u2019s wife, Janka, was Jewish.  Due to persecution of the Jews by the [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] regime, circumstances caused Meissner stepped down as director in June 1937.  While he continued his teaching responsibilities, he was forced to resign in August of that year.  Unable to find an industry position, Meissner traveled to the United States in the spring of 1938 to lecture at 10 universities.  Circumstances in Germany, including [[Nazi]] regulation of travel, did not allow him to take Janka with him.  From three offers in the United States, Meissner selected a position as assistant professor at [[Worcester Polytechnic Institute]] in November of that year.  In early 1939, Janka died from cancer.<ref name=\"Karl Meissner\"/>\n\nFrom 1941, to the end of his career, Meissner was at [[Purdue University]], first as a visiting professor and then, after naturalization, a full professor and director of the spectroscopy laboratory.   In 1942, he married Hanna Hellinger, the sister of a former mathematician colleague at Frankfurt am Main, [[Ernst Hellinger]], who had emigrated from Germany in February 1941.<ref>[[:de:Ernst Hellinger|Ernst Hellinger]] \u2013 Wikipedia: Deutsch</ref>  Hanna taught from 1944 to 1965 as professor of sociology and social science at Purdue.<ref name=\"Karl Meissner\"/>\n\nOutside of physics, Meissner\u2019s interests also included history, literature, and languages.  He spoke German, English, French, and Italian, and was able to also read Latin, Greek, and Hebrew.<ref name=\"Karl Meissner\"/>\n\nOn 9 April 1959, Meissner sailed from [[New York City]] for Europe to visit his sister and niece, visit the ''Bureau International des Poids et Mesures'' ([[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]]), teach in the summer semester at the Christian-Albrechts [[University of Kiel]], and attend an [[interferometry]] conference in London.  During the voyage, he died on 13 April.  His wife, Hanna, died thirty years later on 8 February 1989, in [[Lafayette, Indiana]].<ref name=\"Karl Meissner\"/>\n\n==Selected Literature==\n*K. W.

He was awarded his doctorate in 1915, on a thesis with the title ''Interferometrische Wellenl\u00e4ngenbestimmung im infraroten Spektralbereich''.<ref>Translation from the German:  ''Interferometric wavelength regulation in the infrared spectral region''.</ref>  In 1916 he became an assistant to Edgar Meyer<ref>[http://physics.syr.edu/~rsholmes/genealogy.html Edgar Meyer] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070208073557/http://physics.syr.edu/~rsholmes/genealogy.html |date=2007-02-08 }} \u2013 Biographical Information</ref> at the [[University of Zurich]], under whom he completed his [[Habilitation]], in 1918, with the [[Habilitationsschrift]] title ''Untersuchungen des Neonspektrums''.<ref>Translation from the German: ''Investigations of the neon spectrum''.</ref>  The following year, he married the Polish physicist Doctor Janka Kohn.<ref name=\"Karl Meissner\">[http://www.physik.uni-frankfurt.de/paf/paf112.html Karl Meissner] \u2013 University of Frankfurt</ref>\n\n==Career==\n\nIn the summer of 1924, Meissner became a First Assistant at the Physics Institute of the [[University of Zurich]].  Here he studied the spectra of indium, gallium, neon, argon, and caesium, the arc spectrum of lead (spectrum of neutral or non-ionized lead), the [[Stark effect]] of neon, and general problems of detecting radiation.<ref name=\"Karl Meissner\"/>\n\nThe change from Zurich to the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe University of Frankfurt am Main]] occurred in 1925.  Meissner was appointed extraordinarius professor of physics there, when [[Walter Gerlach]] left for the University of T\u00fcbingen.  Shortly thereafter, he received calls to the Donro Institute at Davos and the ''Physikalisch Technische Reichsanstalt'' in Berlin; he declined both.  After the retirement of Martin Brendel and with the support of Richard Wachsmuth, Meissner was appointed ordinarius professor of astronomy and director of the University\u2019s observatory.  Upon retirement of Wachsmuth, Meissner was appointed as his successor to the chair for astronomy and director of the astronomy institute in 1932.<ref name=\"Karl Meissner\"/>\n\nSpectral lines are broadened due to random movements and collisions of the emitting atoms; this limits resolution.  To reduce these broadening mechanism, Meissner, with K. F. Luft and independently of R. Minkowski and H. Bruck, in 1935, developed the technique of observing particle beams perpendicular to their direction of flow.<ref>\nR. Minkowski and H. Bruck, ''Zeits. f. Physik'' '''95''' 284 (1935).  K. W. Meissner and K. F. Luft, ''Ann. d. Physik'' '''28''' 667 (1937).</ref>  With this technique, Meissner could investigate the hyperfine structure of spectra, which are due to the magnetic moment of the atomic nuclei. This is an area of experimental research which would occupy Meissner for many years.<ref name=\"Karl Meissner\"/>\n\nMeissner\u2019s wife, Janka, was Jewish.  Due to persecution of the Jews by the [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] regime, circumstances caused Meissner stepped down as director in June 1937.  While he continued his teaching responsibilities, he was forced to resign in August of that year.  Unable to find an industry position, Meissner traveled to the United States in the spring of 1938 to lecture at 10 universities.  Circumstances in Germany, including [[Nazi]] regulation of travel, did not allow him to take Janka with him.  From three offers in the United States, Meissner selected a position as assistant professor at [[Worcester Polytechnic Institute]] in November of that year.  In early 1939, Janka died from cancer.<ref name=\"Karl Meissner\"/>\n\nFrom 1941, to the end of his career, Meissner was at [[Purdue University]], first as a visiting professor and then, after naturalization, a full professor and director of the spectroscopy laboratory.   In 1942, he married Hanna Hellinger, the sister of a former mathematician colleague at Frankfurt am Main, Ernst Hellinger, who had emigrated from Germany in February 1941.<ref>[[:de:Ernst Hellinger|Ernst Hellinger]] \u2013 Wikipedia: Deutsch</ref>  Hanna taught from 1944 to 1965 as professor of sociology and social science at Purdue.<ref name=\"Karl Meissner\"/>\n\nOutside of physics, Meissner\u2019s interests also included history, literature, and languages.  He spoke German, English, French, and Italian, and was able to also read Latin, Greek, and Hebrew.<ref name=\"Karl Meissner\"/>\n\nOn 9 April 1959, Meissner sailed from [[New York City]] for Europe to visit his sister and niece, visit the ''Bureau International des Poids et Mesures'' ([[International Bureau of Weights and Measures]]), teach in the summer semester at the Christian-Albrechts [[University of Kiel]], and attend an [[interferometry]] conference in London.  During the voyage, he died on 13 April.  His wife, Hanna, died thirty years later on 8 February 1989, in [[Lafayette, Indiana]].<ref name=\"Karl Meissner\"/>\n\n==Selected Literature==\n*K. W.

The principal cast consisted of [[Matthew McConaughey]], [[Woody Harrelson]], [[Michelle Monaghan]], [[Michael Potts (actor)|Michael Potts]], and [[Tory Kittles]]. The season had eight episodes, and its initial airing concluded on March 9, 2014. As an anthology, each ''True Detective'' season has its own self-contained story, following a disparate set of characters in various settings.\n\nConstructed as a [[nonlinear narrative]], season one focuses on [[Louisiana State Police]] homicide detectives [[Rust Cohle|Rustin \"Rust\" Cohle]] (McConaughey) and Martin \"Marty\" Hart (Harrelson), who investigated the murder of prostitute Dora Lange in 1995.  Seventeen years later, they must revisit the investigation, along with several other unsolved crimes. During this time, Hart's infidelity threatens his marriage to Maggie (Monaghan), and Cohle struggles to cope with his troubled past. ''True Detective''{{'s}} first season explores themes of [[philosophical pessimism]], masculinity, and Christianity; critics have analyzed the show's portrayal of women, its [[auteur theory|auteurist]] sensibility, and the influence of [[comics]] and [[Weird fiction|weird]] [[horror fiction]] on its narrative.\n\nPizzolatto initially conceived ''True Detective'' as a novel, but felt it was more suitable for television. The episodes, directed by [[Cary Joji Fukunaga]], were filmed in Louisiana over a three-month period. The series received positive reviews from critics and was cited as one of the strongest dramas of the 2014 television season. It was a candidate for numerous television awards, including a [[Primetime Emmy Award]] nomination for [[Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series|Outstanding Drama Series]] and a [[Golden Globe Award]] for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Miniseries or Television Film|Best Miniseries or Television Film]], and won several other honors for writing, cinematography, direction, and acting.\n\n==Episodes==\n{{see also|List of True Detective episodes}}\n<onlyinclude>{{Episode table |background=#9aaaa5 |overall=6 |season=6 |title=24 |director=16 |writer=23 |airdate=15 |viewers=10 |country=U.S. |episodes=\n{{Episode list/sublist|True Detective (season 1)\n |EpisodeNumber = 1\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 1\n |Title = [[The Long Bright Dark]]\n |DirectedBy = {{nowrap|[[Cary Joji Fukunaga]]}}\n |WrittenBy = {{nowrap|[[Nic Pizzolatto]]}}\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2014|1|12}}\n |Viewers = 2.33<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2014/01/14/sunday-cable-ratings-real-housewives-of-atlanta-wins-night-true-detective-ax-men-shameless-more/229014/ |title=Sunday Cable Ratings: 'Real Housewives of Atlanta' Wins Night, 'True Detective', 'Ax Men', 'Shameless' & More |last=Kondolojy |first=Amanda |date=January 14, 2014 |publisher=[[TV by the Numbers]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151104201423/http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2014/01/14/sunday-cable-ratings-real-housewives-of-atlanta-wins-night-true-detective-ax-men-shameless-more/229014/ |archive-date=November 4, 2015}}</ref>\n |ShortSummary = [[Vermilion Parish, Louisiana]], January 3, 1995. State homicide detectives Martin \"Marty\" Hart ([[Woody Harrelson]]) and [[Rust Cohle|Rustin \"Rust\" Cohle]] ([[Matthew McConaughey]]) investigate the murder of a prostitute, 28-year-old Dora Lange. Her corpse is found posed as if in prayer, her head is crowned with deer antlers, and her body is surrounded by twig latticeworks closely resembling [[Cajun]] bird traps. Hart and Cohle turn to a five-year-old missing-persons case of a child named Marie Fontenot. Around the same time, another child claimed to have been chased through the woods by a \"green-eared spaghetti monster.\" At the insistence of his wife Maggie ([[Michelle Monaghan]]), Hart invites Cohle to dinner, but is infuriated when Cohle arrives drunk. While following up on the Fontenot disappearance, they discover another twig latticework.\n----\nSeventeen years later in May 2012, Hart and Cohle are separately interviewed about the Lange investigation by detectives Thomas Papania ([[Tory Kittles]]) and Maynard Gilbough ([[Michael Potts (actor)|Michael Potts]]). Hart and Cohle have not spoken since an altercation in 2002.

Animosity between Cohle and Hart flares after Cohle suspects Hart is cheating on Maggie. Reverend Billy Lee Tuttle ([[Jay O. Sanders]]), a celebrated evangelist and cousin of the governor, advocates a police task force focusing on \"anti-Christian crimes,\" including the Lange murder. Hart and Cohle's investigation leads them to a remote ranch harboring runaway girls who work there as prostitutes. They find Lange's diary, which contains repeated references to \"[[Carcosa]]\" and a \"[[The King in Yellow|Yellow King]],\" at the ranch. In the wreckage of a burnt-out church Lange attended, they find a wall painting depicting a human figure wearing deer antlers.\n----\nIn 2012, Cohle reflects on his daughter's death in a car accident, which led to the collapse of his marriage and his spending four years as an undercover narcotics investigator. His undercover career ended with a lethal gunfight, after which he was hospitalized in a psychiatric institution. After his release, Cohle requested a job in homicide and was partnered with Hart. Cohle reveals that he experiences brief, intermittent episodes of visual hallucinations caused by years of drug use while working as an undercover officer. Shots from 1995 show that Cohle occasionally suffers these hallucinations when he is with Hart, but he does not discuss them.

Lisa reveals the affair to Maggie, who leaves the house with their daughters. Hart confronts Maggie at her workplace; Cohle extricates him from a standoff with security officers. Cohle's contact in the Iron Crusaders, Ginger ([[Joseph Sikora]]), promises access to the gang's meth supply in exchange for Cohle's (who is known to the gang as \"Crash\") help robbing a rival gang. The robbery goes badly, with fatalities on both sides and rising chaos in the rival gang's neighborhood.

DeWall refuses to do business with Cohle, but unwittingly leads him and Hart to a meth lab hidden in the bayou. There, Hart apprehends Reggie Ledoux, who makes cryptic statements about \"Carcosa\". Hart kills Reggie in a rage after discovering two kidnapped and abused children, a brother and sister, in the compound. DeWall flees but dies after triggering a homemade booby trap. Hart and Cohle plant evidence to make it look as though an intense shootout has taken place, a scenario they report to a police investigation. They are hailed as heroes at the police station and in the press, and they receive commendations and promotions.\n----\nBy 2002, Hart and Maggie have reconciled and Cohle is dating again. While Cohle is consulting on a police interrogation, the prisoner asks for a [[plea bargain]] in exchange for information about Dora Lange's killer, who he claims is still at large and killing. He mentions the \"Yellow King,\" which gets Cohle's attention. The prisoner kills himself in his cell before Cohle can investigate his claims.

Among the evidence is a videotape, which Cohle stole from a safe in Rev. Tuttle's home, of men in costumes and masks ritualistically raping and murdering Marie Fontenot (the missing-child case they briefly investigated in 1995). Cohle denies killing Tuttle, speculating that others did it to prevent Tuttle from being blackmailed over the tape. Hart, shaken from watching the videotape, agrees to join the investigation. They learn that Tuttle had an illegitimate half-brother with the surname Childress, whose son had scars on his face. They also learn that their former colleague Steve Geraci ([[Michael Harney]]) was ordered by his boss Ted Childress\u2014then the sheriff of Vermilion Parish\u2014to cut short his investigation of Fontenot's disappearance. Hart and Cohle accost Geraci to coerce the details from him, threatening him if he should try to go to the authorities or have them arrested.

He speaks cryptically in multiple accents, and keeps his father's decaying corpse in a shed on his property. Later, he goes to work painting a school, where he watches children on the playground. Hart and Cohle extract details from Geraci by showing him the Fontenot tape. Hart thinks the \"green-eared spaghetti monster\" may have been the scarred man covered in green paint after painting a house in Dora Lange's neighborhood in 1995. They trace the paint job to a small business owned by William Childress that employed a man with scars on his face. They visit William Childress's home\u2014the house where the \"man with the scars\" lives. Cohle pursues the man, William Childress's son Errol, through a labyrinth of trees and tunnels that Errol identifies as Carcosa. At the end, Cohle discovers an [[Cult image|idol]] draped in yellow and covered in skulls, and briefly sees a hallucination of a sort of spiraling vortex. Cohle is then attacked by Errol. Hart, after detaining the woman and calling the police, discovers William's decaying corpse and runs to Cohle's aid. Hart and Cohle fight Errol; they are both severely wounded, but Cohle manages to kill Errol via a gunshot to the head. Papania and Gilbough arrive with reinforcements as Hart aids Cohle. While Hart and Cohle recover in hospital, Papania and Gilbough connect Errol to dozens of missing-person cases and murders, including Dora Lange's, finding several bodies buried in the yard. The Tuttles escape prosecution, but are publicly disgraced. Hart breaks down in tears when Maggie and their daughters visit him. Cohle reveals that during his ordeal, he felt the loving presence of his dead father and daughter, and the experience has given his life renewed purpose.

Scenes set in 1995 and 2002 were captured with Panavision PVintage lenses, which produced a softer image because they were made of recycled, low-contrast glass. As these scenes were written as a reflection of Cohle and Hart's memory, production sought to make them as cinematic as possible, to reflect what Arkapaw called \"the fragmentation of their lucid imaginations back through their past.\"<ref name=kodak/> To achieve this, they relied on wider lenses to exaggerate composition.<ref name=kodak/> The 2012 scenes were shot with Panavision Primo lenses: the visual palette in comparison was sharper and had much more contrast, lending a \"modern, crisp feeling\" to the images, and, according to Arkapaw, pulling \"characters out from their environments to hopefully help audiences get inside their heads.\"<ref name=kodak/>\n\n===Art design===\n[[File:TrueDetectivedigitaldouble.jpg|thumb|left|The design team used an assortment of low poly meshes to develop a 3D landscape for the show's title sequence, which were later meticulously superimposed.

DiGerlando and Walsh went with a tripod design that showed a spiral when viewed from the base, and contained ladder-like crossing elements that symbolized the killer's desire to ascend to a dark [[Plane (esotericism)|spiritual plane]]. Each design had subtle differences from one another.<ref name=art/> DiGerlando cited the work of [[Henry Darger]] and [[James Charles Castle]] as strong stylistic influences and sought a primitive look for the sculptures, one that revealed the workings of a man with \"some deep inner urge to express himself\".<ref name=art/> To reflect this, Walsh built devil's nests using mud, secondhand children's clothing, reeds, roots, and other materials he felt the killer would use.<ref name=art/>\n\nThe season's title sequence was a collaboration between director Patrick Clair, his [[Santa Monica]]-based studio Elastic, his [[Sydney]]-based studio Antibody, and [[Brisbane]]-based company Breeder.<ref name=\"aott\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.artofthetitle.com/title/true-detective/ |title=True Detective (2014) |last=Perkins |first=Will |date=January 14, 2014 |publisher=[[Art of the Title]] |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151105191607/http://www.artofthetitle.com/title/true-detective/ |archive-date=November 5, 2015}}</ref><ref name=\"fc2\">{{Cite web |url=http://www.fastcodesign.com/3027343/a-behind-the-scenes-look-at-the-chilling-the-opening-credits-of-true-detective |title=A Behind-The-Scenes Look at the Chilling Opening Credits Of 'True Detective' |last=Rhodes |first=Margaret |date=March 7, 2014 |website=Fast Company |publisher=Fast Company, Inc. |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151105214628/http://www.fastcodesign.com/3027343/a-behind-the-scenes-look-at-the-chilling-the-opening-credits-of-true-detective |archive-date=November 5, 2015}}</ref> The design team emphasized southern Louisiana's industrial landscape because it reflected the characters' traits and personal, inner struggles.

As a result, many shots were digitally altered and slowed to about a tenth of their original speed, which, according to Clair, \"evoked a surreal and floaty mood that perfectly captured what we were after.\"<ref name=aott/>\n\nCreation of a [[3D computer graphics|3D]] effect required the design team to use an assortment of [[low poly|low-poly meshes]], or 3D geometric models.<ref name=aott/> Using a variety of animation and special effects techniques, these images were later [[superimposed]] \"with painstaking care\" to avoid a sterile, digitized look.<ref name=fc2/> Clair said, \"The most crucial thing to me was that this didn't feel digital, so we went to great lengths to incorporate as much organic imagery as possible.\"<ref name=fc2/> For some stills, the design team created [[digital double]]s to develop more texture.

The principal cast consisted of [[Matthew McConaughey]], [[Woody Harrelson]], [[Michelle Monaghan]], [[Michael Potts (actor)|Michael Potts]], and [[Tory Kittles]]. The season had eight episodes, and its initial airing concluded on March 9, 2014. As an anthology, each ''True Detective'' season has its own self-contained story, following a disparate set of characters in various settings.\n\nConstructed as a [[nonlinear narrative]], season one focuses on [[Louisiana State Police]] homicide detectives [[Rust Cohle|Rustin \"Rust\" Cohle]] (McConaughey) and Martin \"Marty\" Hart (Harrelson), who investigated the murder of prostitute Dora Lange in 1995.  Seventeen years later, they must revisit the investigation, along with several other unsolved crimes. During this time, Hart's infidelity threatens his marriage to Maggie (Monaghan), and Cohle struggles to cope with his troubled past. ''True Detective''{{'s}} first season explores themes of [[Philosophical Pessimism|philosophical pessimism]], masculinity, and Christianity; critics have analyzed the show's portrayal of women, its [[auteur theory|auteurist]] sensibility, and the influence of [[comics]] and [[Weird fiction|weird]] [[horror fiction]] on its narrative.\n\nPizzolatto initially conceived ''True Detective'' as a novel, but felt it was more suitable for television.

State homicide detectives Martin \"Marty\" Hart ([[Woody Harrelson]]) and [[Rust Cohle|Rustin \"Rust\" Cohle]] ([[Matthew McConaughey]]) investigate the murder of a prostitute, 28-year-old Dora Lange. Her corpse is found posed as if in prayer, her head is crowned with deer antlers, and her body is surrounded by twig latticeworks closely resembling [[Cajun]] bird traps. Hart and Cohle turn to a five-year-old missing-persons case of a child named Marie Fontenot. Around the same time, another child claimed to have been chased through the woods by a \"green-eared spaghetti monster.\" At the insistence of his wife Maggie ([[Michelle Monaghan]]), Hart invites Cohle to dinner, but is infuriated when Cohle arrives drunk. While following up on the Fontenot disappearance, they discover another twig latticework.\n----\nSeventeen years later in May 2012, Hart and Cohle are separately interviewed about the Lange investigation by detectives Thomas Papania ([[Tory Kittles]]) and Maynard Gilbough ([[Michael Potts (actor)|Michael Potts]]). Hart and Cohle have not spoken since an altercation in 2002. The crime scene of a recently slain woman closely resembles the Lange murder scene, suggesting that despite Cohle and Hart's claims of apprehending the killer in 1995, the killer may remain at large.\n |LineColor = 9aaaa5\n}}\n{{Episode list/sublist|True Detective (season 1)\n |EpisodeNumber = 2\n |EpisodeNumber2 = 2\n |Title = Seeing Things\n |DirectedBy = Cary Joji Fukunaga\n |WrittenBy = Nic Pizzolatto\n |OriginalAirDate = {{Start date|2014|1|19}}\n |Viewers = 1.67<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2014/01/22/sunday-cable-ratings-real-housewives-of-atlanta-wins-night-keeping-up-with-the-kardashians-shameless-true-detective-girls-more/230965/ |title=Sunday Cable Ratings: 'Real Housewives of Atlanta' Wins Night, 'Keeping Up With the Kardashians', 'Shameless', 'True Detective', 'Girls' & More |last=Bibel |first=Sara |date=January 22, 2014 |publisher=TV by the Numbers |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151104201834/http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2014/01/22/sunday-cable-ratings-real-housewives-of-atlanta-wins-night-keeping-up-with-the-kardashians-shameless-true-detective-girls-more/230965/ |archive-date=November 4, 2015}}</ref>\n |ShortSummary = 1995. Animosity between Cohle and Hart flares after Cohle suspects Hart is cheating on Maggie. Reverend Billy Lee Tuttle ([[Jay O. Sanders]]), a celebrated evangelist and cousin of the governor, advocates a police task force focusing on \"anti-Christian crimes,\" including the Lange murder. Hart and Cohle's investigation leads them to a remote ranch harboring runaway girls who work there as prostitutes. They find Lange's diary, which contains repeated references to \"[[Carcosa]]\" and a \"[[The King in Yellow|Yellow King]],\" at the ranch. In the wreckage of a burnt-out church Lange attended, they find a wall painting depicting a human figure wearing deer antlers.\n----\nIn 2012, Cohle reflects on his daughter's death in a car accident, which led to the collapse of his marriage and his spending four years as an undercover narcotics investigator. His undercover career ended with a lethal gunfight, after which he was hospitalized in a psychiatric institution. After his release, Cohle requested a job in homicide and was partnered with Hart. Cohle reveals that he experiences brief, intermittent episodes of visual hallucinations caused by years of drug use while working as an undercover officer. Shots from 1995 show that Cohle occasionally suffers these hallucinations when he is with Hart, but he does not discuss them.

Their investigation continues in the face of pressure to turn the case over to Tuttle's new task force. Hart enters a jealous rage when he discovers his mistress Lisa ([[Alexandra Daddario]]) with another man. While researching old investigations, Cohle identifies symbols similar to the Lange case in the death of Rianne Olivier, which was classified as accidental. Hart and Cohle visit Light of the Way Academy, a religious school run by Tuttle that Olivier attended, but find it abandoned save for a groundskeeper on a riding lawnmower, whom Cohle questions. They discover that Olivier's boyfriend, Reggie Ledoux ([[Charles Halford]]) is an ex-con who was a cellmate of Dora Lange's ex-husband, Charlie, and has since skipped parole.

Cohle, who had been a member of the gang while undercover, takes personal leave to infiltrate it, saying he needs to visit his dying father. Lisa reveals the affair to Maggie, who leaves the house with their daughters. Hart confronts Maggie at her workplace; Cohle extricates him from a standoff with security officers. Cohle's contact in the Iron Crusaders, Ginger ([[Joseph Sikora]]), promises access to the gang's meth supply in exchange for Cohle's (who is known to the gang as \"Crash\") help robbing a rival gang. The robbery goes badly, with fatalities on both sides and rising chaos in the rival gang's neighborhood.

DeWall refuses to do business with Cohle, but unwittingly leads him and Hart to a meth lab hidden in the bayou. There, Hart apprehends Reggie Ledoux, who makes cryptic statements about \"Carcosa\". Hart kills Reggie in a rage after discovering two kidnapped and abused children, a brother and sister, in the compound. DeWall flees but dies after triggering a homemade booby trap. Hart and Cohle plant evidence to make it look as though an intense shootout has taken place, a scenario they report to a police investigation. They are hailed as heroes at the police station and in the press, and they receive commendations and promotions.\n----\nBy 2002, Hart and Maggie have reconciled and Cohle is dating again. While Cohle is consulting on a police interrogation, the prisoner asks for a [[plea bargain]] in exchange for information about Dora Lange's killer, who he claims is still at large and killing.

Cohle denies killing Tuttle, speculating that others did it to prevent Tuttle from being blackmailed over the tape. Hart, shaken from watching the videotape, agrees to join the investigation. They learn that Tuttle had an illegitimate half-brother with the surname Childress, whose son had scars on his face.

He speaks cryptically in multiple accents, and keeps his father's decaying corpse in a shed on his property. Later, he goes to work painting a school, where he watches children on the playground. Hart and Cohle extract details from Geraci by showing him the Fontenot tape. Hart thinks the \"green-eared spaghetti monster\" may have been the scarred man covered in green paint after painting a house in Dora Lange's neighborhood in 1995. They trace the paint job to a small business owned by William Childress that employed a man with scars on his face. They visit William Childress's home\u2014the house where the \"man with the scars\" lives. Cohle pursues the man, William Childress's son Errol, through a labyrinth of trees and tunnels that Errol identifies as Carcosa. At the end, Cohle discovers an [[Cult image|idol]] draped in yellow and covered in skulls, and briefly sees a hallucination of a sort of spiraling vortex. Cohle is then attacked by Errol. Hart, after detaining the woman and calling the police, discovers William's decaying corpse and runs to Cohle's aid. Hart and Cohle fight Errol; they are both severely wounded, but Cohle manages to kill Errol via a gunshot to the head. Papania and Gilbough arrive with reinforcements as Hart aids Cohle.

The design became the basis for what later became the [[Oric-1|ORIC]] ATMOS and later [[computer]]s, which has similar keyboard addressing and [[Magnetic tape|tape]] I/O as in the  Microtan 65. The Microtan 65 has a single step function that can be used for [[debugging]] at the [[computer hardware|hardware]] level. The computer was available as ready-built [[Printed circuit board|board]]s or as kits consisting of board and [[Electronic component|components]] requiring [[soldering]] together.\n\nThe Microtan 65 was intended as a general purpose microcomputer which could be used by [[Laboratory|laboratories]], [[Original Equipment Manufacturers]] (OEM)s and the computer enthusiast, and it was designed with expandability in mind.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.microtan.ukpc.net/|title=Tangerine Microtan 65|website=Microtan.ukpc.net|accessdate=2017-06-23}}</ref> In this way the customer could customise the system, be it as a specialised [[control system]], as a learning tool, or as a general purpose computing device.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.computinghistory.org.uk/det/23946/Tangerine-Microtan-65/|title=Tangerine Microtan 65  - Computing History|website=Computinghistory.org.uk|accessdate=2017-06-23}}</ref>\n\nPrice of the Microtan 65 board in 1981 was \u00a379.35 (inc. [[VAT]]) in kit form or \u00a390.85 ready-assembled. The system was not generally available in the shops.\n\nTo accompany the hardware and to offer further support to users, a magazine was created, the ''Tansoft Gazette'' (name inspired by the ''[[Liverpool Software Gazette]]''). This was edited by Tangerine employee Paul Kaufman who continued as editor when the magazine was renamed ''Oric Owner''. Tansoft also became the name of Tangerine Computer's official software house which supplied a number of software products and book for the Microtan system and subsequently for the [[Oric]] range of computers.\n\n== Main Board ==\n[[Image:Tangerine Microtan 65 Main Board.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The Microtan 65 Main Board]]\n\nThe Microtan 65 was quite simple by today's standards, with:\n* an NMOS [[MOS Technology 6502|6502]] [[CPU]] running at 750 [[kHz]] [[clock rate]]\n* 1K byte of [[Random access memory|RAM]], used both for display memory and user programs\n* 1K byte of [[Read-only Memory|ROM]] for the [[Resident_monitor|monitor program]]\n* video logic and a [[television]] [[RF modulator]], for the 16 rows of 32 characters display\n* a [[software]] scanned [[hexadecimal]] [[keypad]] <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.microtan.ukpc.net/Schematics/MT65_HEXKEYPAD.PDF |format=PDF |title=Microtan Hex Keypad Design Details |website=Microtan.ukpc.net |accessdate=2017-06-23}}</ref>\n* an optional [[ASCII]] [[Computer keyboard|keyboard]]\n\n=== Display ===\nThe major advance that the Microtan 65 had over a lot of the competition at that time was that the [[computer display|video display]] was flicker free. At the time a lot of microcomputers would either access the screen memory [[Asynchronous operation|asynchronously]] to the video timing (causing flicker and splats on the screen), or would write to the screen memory during a non-display period (which was slow). The Microtan 65 got over this problem by making use of an incidental feature of the [[MOS Technology 6502|6502]]. The 6502 (unlike most other [[CPU]]s) has a regular period in each instruction cycle when all CPU activity is inside the chip, leaving the external memory available without using complex external arbitration logic. This made [[computer display|video display]] design simpler and meant that video accesses could be made at maximum speed. This technique is also used on the [[Oric series of computers|Oric-1]] and [[Oric Atmos|Atmos]], and in the unrelated [[Apple II]].\n\nThe 32\u00d716 characters<ref name=\"geoff.org.uk\"/> was the reason that the 6502 was [[Clock rate|clocked]] at 750&nbsp;kHz. To get the circuitry to work at a (nearly) standard video rate meant that the [[pixel]] clock had to be 6 [[MHz]]. When the Microtan 65 was designed only a 1&nbsp;MHz 6502 was available, and so 750&nbsp;kHz was used (6&nbsp;MHz divided by 8).\n\n[[File:Tangerine Microtan 65 Hex Keypad.jpg|thumb|upright|The Microtan 65 Hex Keypad]]\n\n=== Software ===\n\nThe 1K byte [[Operating system|monitor]] program (later increased to a 2K) is called TANBUG. The [[software]] facilities were rudimentary:\n* M = Memory modify / examine\n* L = List a block of memory\n* G = Go command (Run a program)\n* R = [[Processor register|Registers]] display / modify\n* S = set Single step mode\n* N = set Normal mode (cancel S command)\n* P = Proceed command (execute next instruction in Single step mode)\n* B = set [[Breakpoint]]s\n* O = calculate Offset for use in branch instructions\n* C = Copy a block of memory\n\n=== Memory Map ===\n\nThe Microtan 65 memory map is shown below ($ representing a [[hexadecimal]] memory address): \n     \n* $0000    [[Zero page|Zero Page]]\n* $0100    [[Stack (data structure)|Stack]]\n* $0200    Screen [[RAM]]\n* $0300\n* $0400    End of Microtan 65 RAM - map continued from $0400 to $0700 as RAM on TANEX\n* $8000    I/O\n* $C000\n* $F800    TANBUG V2\n* $FFFF\n\nThe screen memory occupies the space between $200 and $3FF. In addition to the standard 8 [[bit]]s of screen [[RAM]], there was an additional single bit RAM shadowing the $200 to $300 space. This was configured as a 9th [[bit]] write-only plane, and was used by the Microtan 65 for rudimentary, or \"chunky\", graphics. Setting the 9th bit displayed a [[Minitel]] type block graphic.\n\nThe display is 32 characters across by 16 lines down, with memory address $200 representing the top left hand displayed character, $220 the second row, etc. The character representation is standard [[ASCII]]. Several pieces of Microtan 65 software write to the bottom line by writing to memory starting at $3E0 - the leftmost character on the bottom line, rather than vectoring through TANBUG.\n\n=== Input/output ===\n\n[[Input/output|I/O]] in the Microtan 65 is decoded into a 16 KB space to simplify the hardware. In fact the 1 KB of [[Random access memory|RAM]] is mirrored through the bottom 32 KB, the I/O through the next 16 KB, and the [[EPROM]] through the top 16 KB. If you added an expansion board (see TANEX below) the decoding was modified and the wasted space reclaimed.\n\nIn common with other [[MOS Technology 6502|6502]] designs, I/O is [[Memory-mapped I/O|mapped]] into the memory space. There is no dedicated I/O space as on the [[Z80]], [[Intel 8086|8086]] etc. The I/O ports are (when fully decoded):\n\n*Write to $BFF0    Clear [[Computer keyboard|Keyboard]] Flag (Keyboard would generate an [[Interrupt request|IRQ]])\n*Read from $BFF0   Turn Graphics On (enables \"9th [[bit]]\" graphics writes)\n*Write to $BFF1    Used by the hardware single step\n*Write to $BFF2    To write a scan pattern to the [[Hexadecimal|hex]] [[keypad]] (if fitted)\n*Write to $BFF3    Turn off Graphics (disable \"9th [[bit]]\" graphics writes)\n*Read From $BFF3   Read Keyboard Port (either keypad or [[ASCII]] keyboard)\n\n== TANEX expansion board ==\n[[Image:Tangerine Microtan 65 Tanex Board.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The Microtan 65 Tanex board. The EPROM chip with the green spot (centre) contains the XBUG monitor extension, the other three EPROMs the Microsoft Extended BASIC. The bottom row of chips are the 7K static RAM - 14 X 2114. The 6522 VIA is at left, with an empty socket for an additional 6522 alongside. The empty green socket at top centre is for the 6551 UART]].\n\nAdding a TANEX board provided a number of features:\n* an add-on to TANBUG called XBUG\n* space for an additional 7K bytes of [[RAM]]\n* five [[EPROM]] sockets\n* two 6522 VIAs\n* a 6551 [[UART]], providing a [[Compact audio cassette|cassette]] interface for storing and retrieving programs (300 baud [[Kansas City standard|CUTS]], and 2400 [[baud]]), and a [[serial interface]]\n\nWithout a TANEX board, and due to deliberately ambiguous address decoding, the address $F7F7 would appear to the [[MOS Technology 6502|6502]] to have the same data as $FFF7. In TANBUG, this is a jump to an internal monitor routine. With TANEX installed, $F7F7 is decoded properly, and that address is an entry point into XBUG. XBUG provided features such as [[Compact audio cassette|cassette tape]] loading and saving, a simple [[Assembly language assembler|assembler]] / [[disassembler]], [[Hexadecimal|hex]] calculator.\n\nThe [[Read-only memory|ROM]] sockets on TANEX could be used to run a 10K [[Microsoft BASIC|Microsoft Extended BASIC]], a [[two-pass assembler]], or even (and more likely given the hardware bias of the Microtan 65) code written for a specific hardware control application.\n\nPrice of the TANEX board in 1981 was \u00a349.45 as a \"minimum configuration\"  kit - lacking one of the 6522 VIAs and the 6551 and with 1K of RAM - and \u00a360.95 for a similar board fully assembled. TANEX was also available with the board fully populated with chips (although excluding XBUG, ROMs & BASIC) and in this form the costs were \u00a3103.16 for the kit and \u00a3114.66 ready assembled.\n\n==Further Expansion==\n\n[[Image:Tangerine Microtan 65 System Rack Interior.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The interior of a System Rack Microtan 65 with the front panel removed and the ''Microtan 65'' & ''Tanex'' boards at the left]]\n\nThe Microtan 65 was designed as a modular system able to be expanded as required, and for this each board included an 80-pin connector at one end allowing it to be plugged into a backplane-type [[motherboard]]. A simple two-socket \"Mini Motherboard\" connected the Microtan 65 and TANEX boards for minimum expansion and in this form the system was also available ready-built from Tangerine, complete with case and full ASCII keyboard, as the '''Tangerine Micron''', costing \u00a3395.00 in 1981.  For further expansion the builder could purchase the full \"System Motherboard\" which featured an additional ten sockets, bringing the total available sockets to twelve. For housing this, a \"System Rack\", rack-based case was available, in black and silver with a black front panel trimmed in Tangerine's trademark orange.\n\nAdditional boards became available with time, including a 40K memory board - TANRAM, made up of 32K of [[Dynamic random access memory|dynamic]] and 8K of [[Static random access memory|static]] [[Random access memory|RAM]], bringing the total non-paged memory to 48K, a dedicated [[Parallel circuits|parallel]] [[input/output|I/O]] board featuring 16 parallel input/output [[Computer port (hardware)|port]]s; a similar dedicated [[Series circuits|serial]] I/O board featuring 8 serial input/output ports, a [[disk controller]] board for use with [[Hard disk|disk drives]], a [[Disk Operating System]] - TANDOS 65, a high resolution [[graphics]] board featuring 8K of static graphics RAM giving a resolution of 256 \u00d7 256 [[pixel]]s, a dedicated 32K [[Read-only memory|ROM]] board, (aimed mainly at [[Original Equipment Manufacturer|OEM]] and general purpose applications or for use with [[AIM-65|AIM]], [[KIM-1|KIM]] and [[SYM-1|SYM]] systems), capable of holding either 8 \u00d7 2732 or 16 \u00d7 2716 EPROMs; and a 32K RAM board featuring two 16K banks of 4116 dynamic RAM, again intended for similar purposes to the 32K ROM board. In addition, several [[Third-party developer|third-party]] suppliers offered boards designed for use with the Microtan 65 system.\n\nIn addition to the BASIC [[programming language]] Tangerine also released on disk TANFORTH, an extended version of [[Forth (programming language)|FIG FORTH]] featuring a full FORTH [[compiler]] and [[Source code editor|editor]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Research Machines 380Z]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* This article was based on: {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081024034120/http://oric.ifrance.com/microtan_hardware.txt |date=October 24, 2008 |title=Microtan 65 Hardware and Software Description by Ray Gannon and credited ''Distribute as you like.

If you added an expansion board (see TANEX below) the decoding was modified and the wasted space reclaimed.\n\nIn common with other [[MOS Technology 6502|6502]] designs, I/O is [[Memory-mapped I/O|mapped]] into the memory space. There is no dedicated I/O space as on the [[Z80]], [[Intel 8086|8086]] etc. The I/O ports are (when fully decoded):\n\n*Write to $BFF0    Clear [[Computer keyboard|Keyboard]] Flag (Keyboard would generate an [[Interrupt request|IRQ]])\n*Read from $BFF0   Turn Graphics On (enables \"9th [[bit]]\" graphics writes)\n*Write to $BFF1    Used by the hardware single step\n*Write to $BFF2    To write a scan pattern to the [[Hexadecimal|hex]] [[keypad]] (if fitted)\n*Write to $BFF3    Turn off Graphics (disable \"9th [[bit]]\" graphics writes)\n*Read From $BFF3   Read Keyboard Port (either keypad or [[ASCII]] keyboard)\n\n== TANEX expansion board ==\n[[Image:Tangerine Microtan 65 Tanex Board.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The Microtan 65 Tanex board. The EPROM chip with the green spot (centre) contains the XBUG monitor extension, the other three EPROMs the Microsoft Extended BASIC. The bottom row of chips are the 7K static RAM - 14 X 2114. The 6522 VIA is at left, with an empty socket for an additional 6522 alongside. The empty green socket at top centre is for the 6551 UART]].\n\nAdding a TANEX board provided a number of features:\n* an add-on to TANBUG called XBUG\n* space for an additional 7K bytes of [[RAM]]\n* five [[EPROM]] sockets\n* two 6522 VIAs\n* a 6551 [[UART]], providing a [[Compact audio cassette|cassette]] interface for storing and retrieving programs (300 baud [[Kansas City standard|CUTS]], and 2400 [[baud]]), and a [[serial interface]]\n\nWithout a TANEX board, and due to deliberately ambiguous address decoding, the address $F7F7 would appear to the [[MOS Technology 6502|6502]] to have the same data as $FFF7. In TANBUG, this is a jump to an internal monitor routine. With TANEX installed, $F7F7 is decoded properly, and that address is an entry point into XBUG. XBUG provided features such as [[Compact audio cassette|cassette tape]] loading and saving, a simple [[Assembly language assembler|assembler]] / [[disassembler]], [[Hexadecimal|hex]] calculator.\n\nThe [[Read-only memory|ROM]] sockets on TANEX could be used to run a 10K [[Microsoft BASIC|Microsoft Extended BASIC]], a [[two-pass assembler]], or even (and more likely given the hardware bias of the Microtan 65) code written for a specific hardware control application.\n\nPrice of the TANEX board in 1981 was \u00a349.45 as a \"minimum configuration\"  kit - lacking one of the 6522 VIAs and the 6551 and with 1K of RAM - and \u00a360.95 for a similar board fully assembled. TANEX was also available with the board fully populated with chips (although excluding XBUG, ROMs & BASIC) and in this form the costs were \u00a3103.16 for the kit and \u00a3114.66 ready assembled.\n\n==Further Expansion==\n\n[[Image:Tangerine Microtan 65 System Rack Interior.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The interior of a System Rack Microtan 65 with the front panel removed and the ''Microtan 65'' & ''Tanex'' boards at the left]]\n\nThe Microtan 65 was designed as a modular system able to be expanded as required, and for this each board included an 80-pin connector at one end allowing it to be plugged into a backplane-type [[motherboard]]. A simple two-socket \"Mini Motherboard\" connected the Microtan 65 and TANEX boards for minimum expansion and in this form the system was also available ready-built from Tangerine, complete with case and full ASCII keyboard, as the '''Tangerine Micron''', costing \u00a3395.00 in 1981.  For further expansion the builder could purchase the full \"System Motherboard\" which featured an additional ten sockets, bringing the total available sockets to twelve. For housing this, a \"System Rack\", rack-based case was available, in black and silver with a black front panel trimmed in Tangerine's trademark orange.\n\nAdditional boards became available with time, including a 40K memory board - TANRAM, made up of 32K of [[Dynamic random access memory|dynamic]] and 8K of [[Static random access memory|static]] [[Random access memory|RAM]], bringing the total non-paged memory to 48K, a dedicated [[Parallel circuits|parallel]] [[input/output|I/O]] board featuring 16 parallel input/output [[Computer port (hardware)|port]]s; a similar dedicated [[Series circuits|serial]] I/O board featuring 8 serial input/output ports, a [[disk controller]] board for use with [[Hard disk|disk drives]], a [[Disk Operating System]] - TANDOS 65, a high resolution [[graphics]] board featuring 8K of static graphics RAM giving a resolution of 256 \u00d7 256 [[pixel]]s, a dedicated 32K [[Read-only memory|ROM]] board, (aimed mainly at [[Original Equipment Manufacturer|OEM]] and general purpose applications or for use with [[AIM-65|AIM]], [[KIM-1|KIM]] and [[SYM-1|SYM]] systems), capable of holding either 8 \u00d7 2732 or 16 \u00d7 2716 EPROMs; and a 32K RAM board featuring two 16K banks of 4116 dynamic RAM, again intended for similar purposes to the 32K ROM board. In addition, several [[Third-party developer|third-party]] suppliers offered boards designed for use with the Microtan 65 system.\n\nIn addition to the BASIC [[programming language]] Tangerine also released on disk TANFORTH, an extended version of [[Forth (programming language)|FIG FORTH]] featuring a full FORTH [[compiler]] and [[Source code editor|editor]].\n\n==See also==\n* [[Research Machines 380Z]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* This article was based on: {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081024034120/http://oric.ifrance.com/microtan_hardware.txt |date=October 24, 2008 |title=Microtan 65 Hardware and Software Description by Ray Gannon and credited ''Distribute as you like.

However, it was abandoned by a [[Soviet Decrees|Decree]] of the [[Sovnarkom|Soviet government]] six months later.\n\nDaylight saving time was re-introduced in the [[USSR]] on 1 April 1981, by a decision of the [[Council of Ministers (Soviet Union)|Council of Ministers of the USSR]]. Daylight saving time began on 1 April and ended on 1 October each year, until mid-1984, when the USSR began following [[European Summer Time|European daylight saving time rules]], moving clocks forward one hour at 02:00 local standard time on the last Sunday in March, and back one hour at 03:00 local daylight time on the last Sunday in September until 1995, after which the change back occurred on the last Sunday in October. The usage of daylight saving time continued after [[Collapse of the Soviet Union (1985\u20131991)|the Soviet collapse]] but ended in 2011, when Russia stopped observing daylight saving time.\n\nOn 27 March 2011, clocks were advanced as usual, but they did not go back on 30 October 2011, effectively making Moscow Time UTC+04:00 permanently.<ref name=\"End to DST\">{{cite web |url=http://lenta.ru/news/2011/02/08/zimynebudet/ |title=\u041c\u0435\u0434\u0432\u0435\u0434\u0435\u0432 \u043e\u0442\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0438\u043b \u0437\u0438\u043c\u043d\u0435\u0435 \u0432\u0440\u0435\u043c\u044f |date= 8 February 2011 |publisher= Lenta.ru |accessdate=8 February 2011}}</ref>  On 26 October 2014, following another change in the law, the clocks in most of the country were moved back one hour, but summer Daylight Time was not reintroduced; Moscow Time returned to UTC+03:00 permanently.<ref>[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-29773559 Russian clocks go back for last time], [[BBC News]], 25 October 2014</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===Russian Empire===\nIn the [[Russian Empire]], most of the nation observed [[solar time]]. Until 6 October [18 October, N.S.] 1867, [[Alaska]] belonged to Russia ([[Russian America]]) which used the [[Julian calendar]] which was 11 or 12 days behind the [[Gregorian calendar]] as the rest of Russia and had local times up to GMT+15:10. The westernmost area of Russia was [[Congress Poland]], with local times down to GMT+01:10.\n\nDuring the late 19th century, Moscow Mean Time was introduced on 1 January [13 January, N.S.] 1880, originally at [[UTC+02:30|GMT+02:30:17]].<ref name=timeandate>[https://www.timeanddate.com/time/zone/russia/moscow Time Zone in Moscow, Russia]</ref> 2:30:17 corresponds to 37.6166667\u00b0, the longitude of [[Moscow]].

It was formally opened in 1927 by Sir Frederick Guggisberg, then Governor of the British [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]] colony.

An alumnus/alumna of Achimota is known as an \"Akora\".\n\nThe motto of the school is ''[[Ut Omnes Unum Sint]]'' meaning \"That they all may be one\", a reference to the founders' expressed philosophy that starting in the context of school life, black and white, male and female, everyone should integrate and combine synergistically for the good of all. The stylised piano-key design of the Achimota School crest was described by Aggrey at the time: \"You can play a tune of sorts on the black keys only; and you can play a tune of sorts on the white keys only; but for perfect harmony, you must use both the black and the white keys.\"<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110724221438/http://www.ac2010.org/about_achimota.html Achimota School Capital Campaign], 24 July 2011, Ac2010.org. Retrieved 31 August 2011.</ref>\n\n==History==\nAfter the First World War, the Government of the [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]] felt the need for an advanced education. As Guggisberg put it, \"In spite of the existence of one or two educational institutions of a secondary nature, the intellectual gap between the African who had completed his education at an English University and the semi-educated African of our primary school is dangerously wide. No one is more ready than I to sympathize with the legitimate aspirations of the African for advancement and for a greater share in the Government of this country, but if we are to help him to do this, if we are to protect the masses from the hasty and ill-conceived schemes of possible local [[demagogue]]s, we must hasten as rapidly as our means will allow to fill up the gap between the two classes.\"<ref name=\"gquote\">[[Frederick Gordon Guggisberg]], quoted in Stephanie Newell, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=lr8ZB43nY4UC&pg=PA93 Literary Culture in Colonial Ghana: How to Play the Game of Life] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927111336/http://books.google.ca/books?id=lr8ZB43nY4UC&pg=PA93 |date=27 September 2013 }}'', 2002, [[Manchester University Press]], 256 pages, p. 93. {{ISBN|978-0719062742}}</ref>\n\nAchimota College was therefore established as part of Guggisberg's plan to reform the Gold Coast educational system. In August 1920, Guggisberg met and befriended native-born Dr. [[James Aggrey]] who was in the Gold Coast as a member of the [[Phelps Stokes Fund]]'s African Education Commission. In 1922, as a result of the Phelps-Stokes Commission's 1920 report on education, Guggisberg appointed a committee to review its recommendations for Gold Coast education reform. That committee recommended the establishment of a comprehensive institution at Achimota to provide general secondary education, teacher training and technical education for male students. Achimota College was then conceived, thanks to the effort and support of Chiefs such as Nene Sir [[Emmanuel Mate Kole]], Konor of Manya Krobo; [[Nana Sir Ofori Atta]], Omanhene of [[Akyem Abuakwa]] and Nana Amonoo V, Omanhene of [[Anomabo]], as well as prominent statesmen of the time such as the Hon. Dr. [[Benjamin W. Quartey Quaye Papafio]], the Hon. [[F. V. Nanka-Bruce]], both of Accra; the Hon. [[Thomas Hutton-Mills, Sr.]] of Accra, the Hon. E. J. P. Brown of [[Cape Coast]], and the Hon. [[J. E. Casely-Hayford]] of [[Sekondi]].\n\nThe Colonial government meant to carry out its policy to establish an excellent secondary institution where teachers as well as students would be trained. The Legislative Council went on to approve the 1923\u201324 budget for the establishment of the Prince of Wales College and School, and in March 1924, Guggisberg laid the foundation stone. Rev. Alexander G. Fraser was the first Principal (1924\u20131935), and Dr. [[James Aggrey]] was the first Vice-Principal (1924\u20131927). Fraser had previously been Principal of [[Trinity College, Kandy]], an elite school in [[Ceylon]], now [[Sri Lanka]], and was hailed as the greatest colonial headmaster of his day by the ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]''. Aggrey campaigned vigorously for women's education at a time when the idea was not popular, and held the belief that to educate a man was to educate an individual, while educating a woman had more far-reaching benefits to family and community. This led to an increase in the number of places offered to girls by the College.\n\nFrom 1924 until it opened on 28 January 1927, Guggisberg, Fraser and Aggrey worked together to realise Guggisberg's dream of establishing a first-class co-educational school and college.

The guest of honour at the opening ceremony was [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|Edward VIII]], the then Prince of Wales, after whom the school was named. As one of the most prestigious institutions of its kind, known for its high academic standards and culture, it trained [[Pan-Africanism|Pan-Africanist]] leaders during Sub-Saharan Africa's struggle for independence from colonial powers.

In a 2004 tribute to Akora Adrian Sherwood, a longtime English master at Achimota, the Ghana High Commission in London praised Achimota, quoting the words of the school's founding doctrine, for enabling its graduates \"to know the life that is life indeed and go forth from it as living waters to a thirsty land.\"<ref name=\"sherwood\">\n[http://www.modernghana.com/news/48541/1/author-of-english-for-modern-africa-dies.html \"Author of English For Modern Africa Dies\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927193921/http://www.modernghana.com/news/48541/1/author-of-english-for-modern-africa-dies.html |date=27 September 2013 }} , 30 January 2004, Ghana High Commission, London.

Sandy spent his vacations touring towns and villages where Old Achimotans were working to explain the aims and objectives of the OAA. The OAA\u2019s first annual general meeting was held at the school on 23 December 1930, and then once a year thereafter. The participants spend three or four days on the school\u2019s campus.\n*'''Constitution''': The OAA is governed by a constitution, whose principal objective is \"the formation of a bond of union between Old Achimotans and the School to promote the maintenance of their interest in the School and their willingness to assist in its welfare, and to promote the ideals for which Achimota was founded\".\n*'''National Executive Committee''': The OAA's affairs and funds are managed by a National Executive Committee. The Committee consists of three officers of the Association, two ex-officio officers, the immediate past President of the Association and eight other members. The National Executive Committee is elected biennially at an Annual General Meeting.

It was formally opened in 1927 by Sir Frederick Guggisberg, then Governor of the British [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]] colony.

An alumnus/alumna of Achimota is known as an \"Akora\".\n\nThe motto of the school is ''[[Ut Omnes Unum Sint]]'' meaning \"That they all may be one\", a reference to the founders' expressed philosophy that starting in the context of school life, black and white, male and female, everyone should integrate and combine synergistically for the good of all. The stylised piano-key design of the Achimota School crest was described by Aggrey at the time: \"You can play a tune of sorts on the black keys only; and you can play a tune of sorts on the white keys only; but for perfect harmony, you must use both the black and the white keys.\"<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110724221438/http://www.ac2010.org/about_achimota.html Achimota School Capital Campaign], 24 July 2011, Ac2010.org. Retrieved 31 August 2011.</ref>\n\n==History==\nAfter the First World War, the Government of the [[Gold Coast (British colony)|Gold Coast]] felt the need for an advanced education. As Guggisberg put it, \"In spite of the existence of one or two educational institutions of a secondary nature, the intellectual gap between the African who had completed his education at an English University and the semi-educated African of our primary school is dangerously wide. No one is more ready than I to sympathize with the legitimate aspirations of the African for advancement and for a greater share in the Government of this country, but if we are to help him to do this, if we are to protect the masses from the hasty and ill-conceived schemes of possible local [[demagogue]]s, we must hasten as rapidly as our means will allow to fill up the gap between the two classes.\"<ref name=\"gquote\">[[Frederick Gordon Guggisberg]], quoted in Stephanie Newell, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=lr8ZB43nY4UC&pg=PA93 Literary Culture in Colonial Ghana: How to Play the Game of Life] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927111336/http://books.google.ca/books?id=lr8ZB43nY4UC&pg=PA93 |date=27 September 2013 }}'', 2002, [[Manchester University Press]], 256 pages, p. 93. {{ISBN|978-0719062742}}</ref>\n\nAchimota College was therefore established as part of Guggisberg's plan to reform the Gold Coast educational system. In August 1920, Guggisberg met and befriended native-born Dr. [[James Aggrey]] who was in the Gold Coast as a member of the [[Phelps Stokes Fund]]'s African Education Commission. In 1922, as a result of the Phelps-Stokes Commission's 1920 report on education, Guggisberg appointed a committee to review its recommendations for Gold Coast education reform. That committee recommended the establishment of a comprehensive institution at Achimota to provide general secondary education, teacher training and technical education for male students. Achimota College was then conceived, thanks to the effort and support of Chiefs such as Nene Sir [[Emmanuel Mate Kole]], Konor of Manya Krobo; [[Nana Sir Ofori Atta]], Omanhene of [[Akyem Abuakwa]] and Nana Amonoo V, Omanhene of [[Anomabo]], as well as prominent statesmen of the time such as the Hon. Dr. [[Benjamin W. Quartey Quaye Papafio]], the Hon. [[F. V. Nanka-Bruce]], both of Accra; the Hon. [[Thomas Hutton-Mills, Sr.]] of Accra, the Hon. E. J. P. Brown of [[Cape Coast]], and the Hon. [[J. E. Casely-Hayford]] of [[Sekondi]].\n\nThe Colonial government meant to carry out its policy to establish an excellent secondary institution where teachers as well as students would be trained. The Legislative Council went on to approve the 1923\u201324 budget for the establishment of the Prince of Wales College and School, and in March 1924, Guggisberg laid the foundation stone. Rev. Alexander G. Fraser was the first Principal (1924\u20131935), and Dr. [[James Aggrey]] was the first Vice-Principal (1924\u20131927). Fraser had previously been Principal of [[Trinity College, Kandy]], an elite school in [[Ceylon]], now [[Sri Lanka]], and was hailed as the greatest colonial headmaster of his day by the ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]''. Aggrey campaigned vigorously for women's education at a time when the idea was not popular, and held the belief that to educate a man was to educate an individual, while educating a woman had more far-reaching benefits to family and community. This led to an increase in the number of places offered to girls by the College.\n\nFrom 1924 until it opened on 28 January 1927, Guggisberg, Fraser and Aggrey worked together to realise Guggisberg's dream of establishing a first-class co-educational school and college.

In a 2004 tribute to Akora Adrian Sherwood, a longtime English master at Achimota, the Ghana High Commission in London praised Achimota, quoting the words of the school's founding doctrine, for enabling its graduates \"to know the life that is life indeed and go forth from it as living waters to a thirsty land.\"<ref name=\"sherwood\">\n[http://www.modernghana.com/news/48541/1/author-of-english-for-modern-africa-dies.html \"Author of English For Modern Africa Dies\"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927193921/http://www.modernghana.com/news/48541/1/author-of-english-for-modern-africa-dies.html |date=27 September 2013 }} , 30 January 2004, Ghana High Commission, London.

Fraser, whose son Sandy Fraser, then a member of Achimota School\u2019s staff, was the first organising secretary. Sandy spent his vacations touring towns and villages where Old Achimotans were working to explain the aims and objectives of the OAA. The OAA\u2019s first annual general meeting was held at the school on 23 December 1930, and then once a year thereafter. The participants spend three or four days on the school\u2019s campus.\n*'''Constitution''': The OAA is governed by a constitution, whose principal objective is \"the formation of a bond of union between Old Achimotans and the School to promote the maintenance of their interest in the School and their willingness to assist in its welfare, and to promote the ideals for which Achimota was founded\".\n*'''National Executive Committee''': The OAA's affairs and funds are managed by a National Executive Committee. The Committee consists of three officers of the Association, two ex-officio officers, the immediate past President of the Association and eight other members. The National Executive Committee is elected biennially at an Annual General Meeting.

{"title_page": "2011 Rugby World Cup squads", "text_new": "{{Use New Zealand English|date=September 2013}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2011}}\nThe [[2011 Rugby World Cup]] was an international [[rugby union]] tournament played in New Zealand from 9 September to 23 October 2011. Each of the 20 competing nations was required to confirm its 30-man squad by 23 August; only players in these squads were eligible to take part in the tournament.\n\nPlayers could be replaced for medical or compassionate reasons, but they would be unable to return to the squad. Any replacement players had an enforced stand-down period of 48 hours before they could take the field.\n\nPlayers marked (c) were the nominated [[Captain (sports)|captains]] for their teams. Number of caps and players' ages are indicated as of 9 September 2011, the tournament's opening day.\n\nThe tournament was played during the Super Rugby off-season. Players who were released or changed clubs are out-of-contract with their clubs and finished with their 2011 clubs, and in-contract with their national unions and/or future clubs for the 2012 (2011\u201312 in the Northern Hemisphere) season. Players were listed with their current affiliations as of the opening day of the tournament on 9 September (with some on-going updates during the tournament).\n\nThree squads were made up entirely of players from home-based clubs. Two of these, [[Australia national rugby union team|Australia]] and [[New Zealand national rugby union team|New Zealand]], had players who signed with overseas clubs for the 2011\u201312 northern hemisphere season. However, all players on both squads played for clubs within their country, either in Super Rugby or New Zealand's domestic [[ITM Cup]], in the preceding 2011 season. In addition, these players remained under contract with their national unions until the end of the World Cup. The third such squad, [[France national rugby union team|France]], consists entirely of players under contract with French clubs in both 2010\u201311 and 2011\u201312.\n\n==Pool

Each of the 20 competing nations was required to confirm its 30-man squad by 23 August; only players in these squads were eligible to take part in the tournament.\n\nPlayers could be replaced for medical or compassionate reasons, but they would be unable to return to the squad. Any replacement players had an enforced stand-down period of 48 hours before they could take the field.\n\nPlayers marked (c) were the nominated [[Captain (sports)|captains]] for their teams. Number of caps and players' ages are indicated as of 9 September 2011, the tournament's opening day.\n\nThe tournament was played during the Super Rugby off-season. Players who were released or changed clubs are out-of-contract with their clubs and finished with their 2011 clubs, and in-contract with their national unions and/or future clubs for the 2012 (2011\u201312 in the Northern Hemisphere) season. Players were listed with their current affiliations as of the opening day of the tournament on 9 September (with some on-going updates during the tournament).\n\nThree squads were made up entirely of players from home-based clubs. Two of these, [[Australia national rugby union team|Australia]] and [[New Zealand national rugby union team|New Zealand]], had players who signed with overseas clubs for the 2011\u201312 northern hemisphere season. However, all players on both squads played for clubs within their country, either in Super Rugby or New Zealand's domestic [[ITM Cup]], in the preceding 2011 season. In addition, these players remained under contract with their national unions until the end of the World Cup. The third such squad, [[France national rugby union team|France]], consists entirely of players under contract with French clubs in both 2010\u201311 and 2011\u201312.\n\n==Pool
