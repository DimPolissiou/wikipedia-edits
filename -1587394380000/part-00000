When he was eight, he saw his 16-year-old sister Hilda forcibly taken from his family by the police and taken to the [[Cootamundra Domestic Training Home for Aboriginal Girls]] where she was trained to become a domestic servant.\n\nAt 13 Nicholls worked with his uncle as a tar boy and general hand on [[sheep station]]s, and he lived with the shearers. He worked hard and had a cheerful disposition. This annoyed one of the shearers so much that he challenged Nicholls to a fight, with the loser to hand over one week's pay (30 [[Australian pound|shillings]] \u2013 [[Australian dollar|$]]3). After six rounds the shearer who challenged him conceded defeat.\n\n==Sporting career==\n[[File:Northcote 1929.jpg|left|thumb|[[Northcote Football Club]]'s 1929 premiership side.

He played a total of six seasons for Fitzroy, before returning to Northcote in 1938.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=The Sporting Globe|publication-place=Melbourne, VIC|date=4 May 1938|page=3|title=\"Duggie\" cheers Northcote}}</ref> Knee injuries forced him to retire in 1939.

Nevertheless, he became a popular player among spectators; and, upon joining Fitzroy, when he was initially sitting by himself in the change rooms (due to this ostracism), he was befriended by [[Haydn Bunton, Sr.]] who ensured he was made welcome within the team.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article110679183 |title=A legend in his time. |newspaper=[[The Canberra Times]] |location=ACT |date=25 September 1971 |accessdate=24 August 2015 |page=12 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.australianrules.com.au/2003stories/buntonstory.html |title=Haydn Bunton \u2013 legend and myth |last=Mansell |first=Ken |date=17 June 2003 |accessdate=9 December 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080726052821/http://australianrules.com.au/2003stories/buntonstory.html |archivedate=26 July 2008 |url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nLike his close relative [[Lynch Cooper]], Nicholls was also a very capable sprinter. He competed in gift races around Victoria during the athletics seasons, and in 1928 he won both the Nyah and Warracknabeal Gifts.<ref name=\"victor\" /> Following this, the race organisers paid him an appearance fee, board and expenses to enter races. He was the inaugural chairman of the National Aboriginal Sports Foundation.\n\nPlaying football provided employment during the winter. To earn a living during the rest of the year, he [[boxing|boxed]] with [[Jimmy Sharman]]'s Boxing Troupe, a travelling sideshow in which Sharman offered his fighters for challenge against all comers.\n\nDuring World War II, Nicholls was an adept [[boomerang]] thrower, teaching that skill to some members of the United States military. There is a photograph depicting this in the Australian War Memorial archives.<ref>[https://www.awm.gov.au/collection/141672/ Australian War Memorial website. |1944-09-04 Doug Nicholls, an Australian Aborigine and ex-Fitzroy footballer, demonstrating the art of throwing a boomerang to Lieutenant Colonel Forrest M.Carhartt of the United States Army.]</ref> He also organised and captained Aboriginal teams in football matches used for patriotic fundraisers during the war, many of which were played against Northcote.<ref>{{cite news|newspaper=The Argus|publication-place=Melbourne, VIC|title=Northcote to play against Aborigines|page=18|date=14 June 1946}}</ref>\n\n==The long road to the 1967 Referendum==\n[[File:President Patten (right) reads resolution (12097104296).jpg|thumb|Tom Foster, Jack Kinchela (obscured), Doug Nicholls, [[William Cooper (Aboriginal Australian)|William Cooper]], and [[Jack Patten]] reading the resolution of the Aborigines Progressive Association at the All Australian Aboriginal Conference and Day of Mourning at Australian Hall, Sydney on 26 January 1938. ]]\n[[William Cooper (Aboriginal Australian)|William Cooper]], an uncle to Nicholls, mentored him in leadership, eventually placing him as the secretary of the [[Australian Aborigines' League]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://ia.anu.edu.au/biography/nicholls-sir-douglas-ralph-doug-14920|title=Biography - Sir Douglas Ralph (Doug) Nicholls - Indigenous Australia|website=ia.anu.edu.au|access-date=2020-04-01}}</ref> It was a founding principle of the League that Aboriginal Affairs was made a Federal matter, which would require a change in the [[Constitution of Australia]], which could only be effected by a referendum. As early as February 1935 Cooper, Nicholls and others were lobbying Members of Parliament, such as [[Thomas Paterson]], the Commonwealth minister for the interior on this issue. It gained national attention when Nicholls, leveraging his profile as a nationally famous athlete, participated in the [[Day of Mourning (Australia)|Day of Mourning]] protest for Aborigines held in Sydney on 26 January 1938, where Indigenous leaders from across the country made the demand to change the Constitution. The proposed resolution was: <blockquote>WE, representing THE ABORIGINES OF AUSTRALIA, assembled in conference at the Australian Hall, Sydney, on the 26th day of January, 1938, this being the 150th Anniversary of the Whiteman's seizure of our country, HEREBY MAKE PROTEST against the callous treatment of our people by the whitemen during the past 150 years, AND WE APPEAL to the Australian nation of today to make new laws for the education and care of Aborigines, we ask for a new policy which will raise our people TO FULL CITIZEN STATUS and EQUALITY WITHIN THE COMMUNITY.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://aiatsis.gov.au/exhibitions/day-mourning-26th-january-1938|title=Day of Mourning - 26th January 1938|date=2018-01-08|website=Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies|language=en|access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref> </blockquote>Doug Nicholls rose to support the resolution on behalf of the Victorian Aborigines League that day, saying:  <blockquote>On behalf of Victorian Aborigines I want to say that we support this resolution in every way. The public does not realise what our people have suffered for 150 years. Aboriginal girls have been sent to Aboriginal Reserves and have not been given any opportunity to improve themselves. Their treatment has been disgusting. The white people have done nothing for us whatever. Put on Reserves, with no proper education, how can Aborigines take their place as equals with whites? Now is our chance to have things altered. We must fight our very hardest in this cause. After 150 years our people are still bossed and influenced by white people. I know that we could proudly hold our own with others if given the chance. Do not let us forget, also, those of our own people who are still in a primitive state. It is for them that we should try to do something.

In 1949, a letter written by Nicholls prompted the Labor MP, [[Kim Beazley Sr.]] to write to Prime Minister [[Ben Chifley]] asking him to explore how the Constitution could be amended.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://tlf.dlr.det.nsw.edu.au/learningobjects/Content/R10908/object/r11027.html|title=Doug Nicholls|website=tlf.dlr.det.nsw.edu.au|access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref> In 1957, [[Jessie Street]] approached Nicholls about bringing in the Victorian Aboriginal Advancement League to form a federal council to campaign for Aboriginal affairs to become a federal matter \u2014 this would became the [[Federal Council for the Advancement of Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders]].

During this time Pastor Doug was known to have met and negotiated with Prime Ministers [[Robert Menzies]]<ref name=\":0\" /> and [[Harold Holt]]. However, creating the political momentum involved substantial grass roots action. Nicholls' daughter, Pam recalls her father winning support from white Australians at football games: <blockquote>\u201cWith his friend Alick Jackomos, they used to have a card table and go and sit outside the football giving out papers, giving speeches, beckoning people to come sign the petitions for the \u2018yes\u2019 vote.\"<ref>{{Cite news|last=Riordan|first=Primrose|url=https://www.theaustralian.com.au/nation/1967-indigenous-referendum-citizenship-one-footy-fan-at-a-time/news-story/e4edbc62a7e534a1f05ed79ae0da491e|title=1967 indigenous referendum: citizenship, one footy fan at a time|date=May 25, 2017|work=The Australian|access-date=April 1, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref></blockquote>Nicholls interacted with the media frequently. Drawing on his abilities as a preacher, he was able to deliver pithy, persuasive messages which were effective in winning over the Australian public. One common line of argument he made was for the \"Yes\" vote was:<blockquote>\u201cI think it\u2019s a matter of democratic right.

Following his mother's death he took a renewed interest in Christianity and was baptised at Northcote [[Churches of Christ in Australia|Church of Christ]] (now Northern Community Church of Christ) in 1935. He officiated at church and hymn services as a [[lay preacher]] at the Gore Street Mission Centre in [[Fitzroy, Victoria|Fitzroy]].\n\nIn 1941 Nicholls received his call-up notice and he joined the [[2/29th Battalion (Australia)|29th Battalion]] but, in 1942, at the request of the Fitzroy police, he was released from his unit to work as a [[social worker]] in the Fitzroy Aboriginal community. He cared for those trapped in [[alcohol abuse]], gambling, and other social problems, and those who were in trouble with the police. Indigenous people gathered to him and eventually the group was so large that he became the pastor of the first Aboriginal [[Churches of Christ in Australia|Church of Christ]] in Australia. In recognition of the ministry he was already expressing, he was ordained as a minister.\n\nIn a letter to the editor, in 1953, it was noted that Opposition Leader, [[H. V. Evatt]], had asked the Prime Minister [[Robert Menzies]], on 26 February, in Federal Parliament, 'for an invitation to be extended to Capt. Reg Saunders or some other outstanding representative of the aborigines' to be included in the official [[Australia]]n contingent to the [[Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II|coronation]] of [[Elizabeth II]]. The author suggested Nicholls, as an ordained minister, and for his community work in the areas of [[Fitzroy, Victoria|Fitzroy]] and [[Mooroopna, Victoria|Mooroopna]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article64434531 |title=ABORIGINE FOR CORONATION?. |newspaper=[[Portland Guardian|Portland Guardian (Vic. : 1876 - 1953)]] |location=Vic. |date=16 April 1953 |accessdate=27 September 2013 |page=4 Edition: MIDDAY |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n\nIn 1957 Nicholls became a field officer for the [[Aborigines Advancement League]]. He edited their magazine, ''Smoke Signals'', and helped draw Aboriginal issues to the attention of Government officials and the general public. He pleaded for dignity for Aboriginal people as human beings. Support for the AAL grew rapidly.\n\nNicholls helped set up hostels for Aboriginal children, holiday homes for Aboriginal people at [[Queenscliff, Victoria|Queenscliff]] and was a founding member and Victorian Secretary of the [[Federal Council for the Advancement of Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders]] (FCAATSI). In response to protests in the 1950s and 60s for an independent, Aboriginal-run farming cooperative at [[Lake Tyers Mission]] he campaigned on their behalf, but when the board moved to close Lake Tyers, Nichols resigned his position in protest.<ref name=\"ABC\">[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-12-21/lake-tyers-history-piece/5170896 A brief history of the Lake Tyers Aboriginal community, By Jeff Waters, ABC Radio, 21 Dec 2013]</ref>\n\nNicholls was an active [[Freemasonry|Freemason]].<ref name=\"bio\">[http://www.melbourne.vic.gov.au/rsrc/PDFs/Indigenous/BIOGRAPHIES_FOR_NICHOLLS.DOC Biographies of Doug and Gladys Nicholls] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080730211511/http://www.melbourne.vic.gov.au/rsrc/PDFs/Indigenous/BIOGRAPHIES_FOR_NICHOLLS.DOC |date=30 July 2008 }}, Council of Melbourne (accessed 14 January 2008)</ref>\n\n==Governor of South Australia==\n[[File:Douglas Nicholls 1977.jpg|thumb|Pastor Sir Douglas Nicholls is sworn in as Governor of South Australia, in front of Premier Don Dunstan and other dignitaries 1977]]\nNicholls was appointed [[Governor of South Australia]] on 1 December 1976, on the nomination of Premier [[Don Dunstan]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/131798665|title=Historic, says Sir Douglas|newspaper=[[The Canberra Times]]|date=2 December 1976}}</ref> He was the first non-white person to serve as the governor of an Australian state, and is the only Aboriginal person to have held viceregal office.

When he was eight, he saw his 16-year-old sister Hilda forcibly taken from his family by the police and taken to the [[Cootamundra Domestic Training Home for Aboriginal Girls]] where she was trained to become a domestic servant.\n\nAt 13 Nicholls worked with his uncle as a tar boy and general hand on [[sheep station]]s, and he lived with the shearers. He worked hard and had a cheerful disposition. This annoyed one of the shearers so much that he challenged Nicholls to a fight, with the loser to hand over one week's pay (30 [[Australian pound|shillings]] \u2013 [[Australian dollar|$]]3).

He was the inaugural chairman of the National Aboriginal Sports Foundation.\n\nPlaying football provided employment during the winter. To earn a living during the rest of the year, he [[boxing|boxed]] with [[Jimmy Sharman]]'s Boxing Troupe, a travelling sideshow in which Sharman offered his fighters for challenge against all comers.\n\nDuring World War II, Nicholls was an adept [[boomerang]] thrower, teaching that skill to some members of the United States military.

As early as February 1935 Cooper, Nicholls and others were lobbying Members of Parliament, such as [[Thomas Paterson]], the Commonwealth minister for the interior on this issue. It gained national attention when Nicholls, leveraging his profile as a nationally famous athlete, participated in the [[Day of Mourning (Australia)|Day of Mourning]] protest for Aborigines held in Sydney on 26 January 1938, where Indigenous leaders from across the country made the demand to change the Constitution. The proposed resolution was: <blockquote>WE, representing THE ABORIGINES OF AUSTRALIA, assembled in conference at the Australian Hall, Sydney, on the 26th day of January, 1938, this being the 150th Anniversary of the Whiteman's seizure of our country, HEREBY MAKE PROTEST against the callous treatment of our people by the whitemen during the past 150 years, AND WE APPEAL to the Australian nation of today to make new laws for the education and care of Aborigines, we ask for a new policy which will raise our people TO FULL CITIZEN STATUS and EQUALITY WITHIN THE COMMUNITY.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://aiatsis.gov.au/exhibitions/day-mourning-26th-january-1938|title=Day of Mourning - 26th January 1938|date=2018-01-08|website=Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies|language=en|access-date=2020-04-02}}</ref> </blockquote>Doug Nicholls rose to support the resolution on behalf of the Victorian Aborigines League that day, saying:  <blockquote>On behalf of Victorian Aborigines I want to say that we support this resolution in every way. The public does not realise what our people have suffered for 150 years. Aboriginal girls have been sent to Aboriginal Reserves and have not been given any opportunity to improve themselves. Their treatment has been disgusting. The white people have done nothing for us whatever. Put on Reserves, with no proper education, how can Aborigines take their place as equals with whites? Now is our chance to have things altered. We must fight our very hardest in this cause. After 150 years our people are still bossed and influenced by white people.

During this time Pastor Doug was known to have met and negotiated with Prime Ministers [[Robert Menzies]]<ref name=\":0\" /> and [[Harold Holt]]. However, creating the political momentum involved substantial grass roots action. Nicholls' daughter, Pam recalls her father winning support from white Australians at football games: <blockquote>\u201cWith his friend Alick Jackomos, they used to have a card table and go and sit outside the football giving out papers, giving speeches, beckoning people to come sign the petitions for the \u2018yes\u2019 vote.\"<ref>{{Cite news|last=Riordan|first=Primrose|url=https://www.theaustralian.com.au/nation/1967-indigenous-referendum-citizenship-one-footy-fan-at-a-time/news-story/e4edbc62a7e534a1f05ed79ae0da491e|title=1967 indigenous referendum: citizenship, one footy fan at a time|date=May 25, 2017|work=The Australian|access-date=April 1, 2020|url-status=live}}</ref></blockquote>Nicholls interacted with the media frequently. Drawing on his abilities as a preacher, he was able to deliver pithy, persuasive messages which were effective in winning over the Australian public. One common line of argument he made was for the \"Yes\" vote was:<blockquote>\u201cI think it\u2019s a matter of democratic right.

Following his mother's death he took a renewed interest in Christianity and was baptised at Northcote [[Churches of Christ in Australia|Church of Christ]] (now Northern Community Church of Christ) in 1935. He officiated at church and hymn services as a [[lay preacher]] at the Gore Street Mission Centre in [[Fitzroy, Victoria|Fitzroy]].\n\nIn 1941 Nicholls received his call-up notice and he joined the [[2/29th Battalion (Australia)|29th Battalion]] but, in 1942, at the request of the Fitzroy police, he was released from his unit to work as a [[social worker]] in the Fitzroy Aboriginal community. He cared for those trapped in [[alcohol abuse]], gambling, and other social problems, and those who were in trouble with the police. Indigenous people gathered to him and eventually the group was so large that he became the pastor of the first Aboriginal [[Churches of Christ in Australia|Church of Christ]] in Australia. In recognition of the ministry he was already expressing, he was ordained as a minister.\n\nIn a letter to the editor, in 1953, it was noted that Opposition Leader, [[H. V. Evatt]], had asked the Prime Minister [[Robert Menzies]], on 26 February, in Federal Parliament, 'for an invitation to be extended to Capt. Reg Saunders or some other outstanding representative of the aborigines' to be included in the official [[Australia]]n contingent to the [[Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II|coronation]] of [[Elizabeth II]]. The author suggested Nicholls, as an ordained minister, and for his community work in the areas of [[Fitzroy, Victoria|Fitzroy]] and [[Mooroopna, Victoria|Mooroopna]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article64434531 |title=ABORIGINE FOR CORONATION?. |newspaper=[[Portland Guardian|Portland Guardian (Vic. : 1876 - 1953)]] |location=Vic. |date=16 April 1953 |accessdate=27 September 2013 |page=4 Edition: MIDDAY |publisher=National Library of Australia}}</ref>\n\nIn 1957 Nicholls became a field officer for the [[Aborigines Advancement League]]. He edited their magazine, ''Smoke Signals'', and helped draw Aboriginal issues to the attention of Government officials and the general public. He pleaded for dignity for Aboriginal people as human beings. Support for the AAL grew rapidly.\n\nNicholls helped set up hostels for Aboriginal children, holiday homes for Aboriginal people at [[Queenscliff, Victoria|Queenscliff]] and was a founding member and Victorian Secretary of the [[Federal Council for the Advancement of Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders]] (FCAATSI).

On the back was a [[Universal Product Code|UPC]] with marker scribble on the barcode. The A-side was a reissue of the [[Steve Lamacq|\"Evening Session\"]] version of \"Bombtrack\", listed as \"Bombtrack (Live on the [[BBC]])\". The B-side was a then unreleased cover of [[N.W.A]]'s \"[[Fuck tha Police]]\", recorded live on August 13, 1995 at a benefit concert for [[Mumia Abu-Jamal]] at the Capitol Ballroom in [[Washington,

He fought in the [[American War of Independence]] and became a prominent figure of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] and of the [[Napoleonic wars]].\n\nBorn into a noble family of naval officers, Latouche enlisted at the age of 13. He rose to become a competent frigate captain, battling several British ships during the [[American War of Independence]]. His two-frigate squadron once manoeuvred a 74-gun ship of the line to the point of sinking, and he was entrusted with important personalities of the time as passengers, notably [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] and the [[Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette|Marquis de Lafayette]].\n\nDuring the Revolution, Latouche, a [[Freemason]] and aide to [[Phillipe \u00c9galit\u00e9]], took progressive positions as a deputy in the [[Estates General (France)|Estates General]] and later in the [[National Constituent Assembly (France)|National Constituent Assembly]]. His nobility nevertheless made him a target during the [[Reign of Terror]], and he was imprisoned and only freed from prison by the [[Thermidorian Reaction]].\n\nReturned to the Navy after a long period of unemployment, Latouche took command of the [[Flottille de Boulogne]], where he repelled the [[Raids on Boulogne]] organised by [[Horatio Nelson|Nelson]]. He then served in the [[Saint-Domingue expedition]], which irrevocably compromised his health. After his return, he took command of the fleet in Toulon, reorganising it into a potent tool again, but he succumbed to a relapse of illness before he had a chance to use it. Under his successor [[Pierre-Charles Villeneuve|Villeneuve]], the fleet he had refurbished was crushed at the [[Battle of Trafalgar]].\n\n==Career==\nLatouche was born in [[Rochefort-sur-mer]], [[Charente-Maritime]]. His father, [[Louis-Charles Le Vassor de La Touche]], had been the governor of Martinique, until the [[Invasion of Martinique (1762)|Invasion of 1762]], and chief of the naval forces of Rochefort.<ref name=guerin429>Gu\u00e9rin, ''Les Marins illustres'', p.429</ref> His uncle, [[Charles-Auguste Levassor de La Touche-Tr\u00e9ville]],<ref name=guerin426>Gu\u00e9rin, ''Les Marins illustres'', p.426</ref> served as a Rear-Admiral, commanding the light squadron of the France-Spanish fleet under [[Louis Guillouet, comte d'Orvilliers|Orvilliers]] in 1780.<ref name=levot295 />\n\n=== Early career ===\nAt the age of 13, Latouche joined the [[Gardes de la Marine]],<ref name=levot295 /> and took part in numerous naval actions during the [[Seven Years' War]].

Vassor, comte de La Touche-Tr\u00e9ville'''<ref name=levot295>Levot, p.295</ref> (3 June 1745<ref name=levot295 /> \u2013 19 August 1804<ref name=levot296>Levot, p.296</ref>) was a French Vice-admiral. He fought in the [[American War of Independence]] and became a prominent figure of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] and of the [[Napoleonic wars]].\n\nBorn into a noble family of naval officers, Latouche enlisted at the age of 13. He rose to become a competent frigate captain, battling several British ships during the [[American War of Independence]]. His two-frigate squadron once manoeuvred a 74-gun ship of the line to the point of sinking, and he was entrusted with important personalities of the time as passengers, notably [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] and the [[Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette|Marquis de Lafayette]].\n\nDuring the Revolution, Latouche, a [[Freemason]] and aide to [[Phillipe \u00c9galit\u00e9]], took progressive positions as a deputy in the [[Estates General (France)|Estates General]] and later in the [[National Constituent Assembly (France)|National Constituent Assembly]]. His nobility nevertheless made him a target during the [[Reign of Terror]], and he was imprisoned and only freed from prison by the [[Thermidorian Reaction]].\n\nReturned to the Navy after a long period of unemployment, Latouche took command of the [[Flottille de Boulogne]], where he repelled the [[Raids on Boulogne]] organised by [[Horatio Nelson|Nelson]]. He then served in the [[Saint-Domingue expedition]], which irrevocably compromised his health. After his return, he took command of the fleet in Toulon, reorganising it into a potent tool again, but he succumbed to a relapse of illness before he had a chance to use it. Under his successor [[Pierre-Charles Villeneuve|Villeneuve]], the fleet he had refurbished was crushed at the [[Battle of Trafalgar]].\n\n==Career==\nLatouche was born in [[Rochefort-sur-mer]], [[Charente-Maritime]]. His father, [[Louis-Charles Le Vassor de La Touche]], had been the governor of Martinique, until the [[Invasion of Martinique (1762)|Invasion of 1762]], and chief of the naval forces of Rochefort.<ref name=guerin429>Gu\u00e9rin, ''Les Marins illustres'', p.429</ref> His uncle, [[Charles-Auguste Levassor de La Touche-Tr\u00e9ville]],<ref name=guerin426>Gu\u00e9rin, ''Les Marins illustres'', p.426</ref> served as a Rear-Admiral, commanding the light squadron of the France-Spanish fleet under [[Louis Guillouet, comte d'Orvilliers|Orvilliers]] in 1780.<ref name=levot295 />\n\n=== Early career ===\nAt the age of 13, Latouche joined the [[Gardes de la Marine]],<ref name=levot295 /> and took part in numerous naval actions during the [[Seven Years' War]]. He started sailing on the ''Hardi'', ferrying troops to Canada in 1758,<ref>Granier, p.232</ref> and took part in his first action, in 1759 aboard the 64-gun [[French ship Dragon (1748)|''Dragon'']],<ref name=levot295 /> which was under his uncle's command,<ref name=guerin428>Gu\u00e9rin, ''Les Marins illustres'', p.428</ref> taking part in the [[Battle of Quiberon Bay]].<ref name=levot295 /> He also served on the [[Pram (ship)|pram]] [[French ship Louise (1760)|''Louise'']] and harassed the blockading British squadron [[\u00cele-d'Aix]] in October 1760, still under his uncle.<ref name=guerin428 /> In 1762 he served on the 74-gun [[French ship Intr\u00e9pide (1747)|''Intr\u00e9pide'']] and on ''[[French ship Tonnant (1740)|Tonnant]]''. In the summer of that year, Latouche was detached to command two gunboats with which he attacked two British ships, one 60-gun and one 74-gun, waging a two-hour battle.<ref name=guerin430>Gu\u00e9rin, ''Les Marins illustres'', p.430</ref>\n\nAfter the [[Treaty of Paris (1763)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1763, Latouche took part in training campaigns under his uncle Latouche-Tr\u00e9ville and Admiral [[Charles Hector, comte d'Estaing|d'Estaing]],<ref name=guerin430 /> serving on the ships ''Garonne'' in 1763, and ''Hardi'' and ''Bricole'' in 1765.\n\nIn September 1768, aged 23, he was promoted to Ensign. Perhaps under pressure from his family, who hoped for quicker promotions,<ref name=guerin430 /> or because the reform of the Navy forced him to retire,<ref name=hennequin107>Hennequin, p.107</ref> he resigned from the Navy and enlisted in the Army.<ref name=guerin430 /> He became an aide to Governor-General [[Victor-Th\u00e9r\u00e8se Charpentier|d'Ennery]],<ref name=hennequin107 /> newly appointed governor of [[Martinique]], who obtained a commission as a cavalry captain for him.<ref name=hennequin107 /> In 1771, he transferred as captain to the [[R\u00e9giment de La Rochefoucauld-Dragons]], a [[dragoon]] regiment, and became [[Aide-de-camp]] to Governor General [[Louis-Florent, marquis de Vali\u00e8re|Vali\u00e8re]],<ref name=hennequin108>Hennequin, p.108</ref> who commanded at Saint-Domingue.<ref name=granier233>Granier, p.233</ref>\n\nIn 1772, Navy Minister [[Pierre \u00c9tienne Bourgeois de Boynes|Boynes]] acceded to repeated requests from Latouche's family,<ref name=hennequin108 /> and he was reinstated in the Navy as \"''capitaine de br\u00fblot''\".<ref name=levot295 /> Latouche was appointed to command the [[fluyt]] ''Courtier''.<ref name=hennequin108 /> In 1774, Latouche put forward a proposition to the Ministry Navy for an exploratory expedition to [[Circumnavigation|circumnavigate]] Australia to see whether [[New Holland (Australia)|New Holland]] and [[New South Wales]] were separated by a channel; the plan was rejected, as the Ministry preferred using [[Mauritius|\u00cele de France]] as the forward base for such an operation.<ref>Day, pp.129-130</ref> Latouche corresponded with Captain [[James Cook|Cook]] on exploration plans in 1775 and 1776.<ref>Lynn, p.272</ref>\n\n=== Service on ''Hermione'' and the American War of Independence ===\n[[File:Marins-illustres-489-b.png|thumb|left|upright|Latouche-Tr\u00e9ville as represented in Gu\u00e9rin's 1845 ''Marins Illustres''.]]\nIn May 1777, he was promoted to Lieutenant and was granted the Lieutenant commander of the 20-gun [[corvette]] ''Rossignol'',<ref name=levot295 /> which escorted convoys and ferried messages.<ref name=guerin430 /> He captured two English privateers and three merchantmen.<ref name=levot295 /><ref name=hennequin108 /> His prizes saw him appointed [[Order of Saint Louis|Knight of the Order of Saint-Louis]].<ref name=levot295 /><ref name=guerin430 /> He was appointed [[commander]] of  the 26-gun frigate [[French frigate Hermione (1779)|''Hermione'']].<ref name=guerin430 />\n\nOn 28 May 1779, ''Hermione'' spotted a British privateer, which she lured into a trap by feigning fleeing in the night. In order to induce a tiring chase, Latouche let his ship's beacon be glimpsed intermittently, before doubling back to attack his opponent in the morning. The privateer was the 18-gun ''Diffidence'', of Falmouth.<ref name=guerin431>Gu\u00e9rin, ''Les Marins illustres'', p.431</ref> The next day, another 18-gun privateer attacked and Latouche captured her too, using the same ruse.<ref name=guerin431 /><ref group=Note>Gu\u00e9rin (p.431) indicates that her name signified ''Resolution of the Ladies of London'', possibly meaning ''Ladies' Resolution'', of London.</ref>  Latouche then returned to Rochefort with his two prizes and numerous prisoners.<ref name=guerin431 />\n\nFrom 21 March to 28 April 1780,<ref name=roche241>Roche, p.241</ref> Latouche carried General [[Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette|Lafayette]] as a passenger on a transatlantic voyage from France to Boston.<ref name=levot295 /><ref name=guerin431 /> Then, joining the fleet under Rear-Admiral [[Charles Ren\u00e9 Dominique Sochet, Chevalier Destouches|Destouches]], and under orders from [[Jacques-Melchior Saint-Laurent, Comte de Barras|Barras]] and [[Charles-Henri-Louis d'Arsac de Ternay|Ternay]],<ref name=hennequin108 /> he directed the building of several artillery batteries for the defence of [[Rhode Island]].<ref name=guerin431 />\n\nAfter he had completed the batteries, Latouche received authorization to cruise off [[Long Island]] and intercept shipping to [[New York City]].<ref name=guerin431 /> He quickly captured two prizes, before spotting four sails on 7 June 1780: these were the frigate [[USS Hancock (1776)|''Iris'']] and three lesser warships.<ref name=guerin431 /> In the ensuing [[Action of 7 June 1780]], Latouche was himself shot in the arm by a musket ball,<ref name=levot295 /> and ''Hermione'' suffered ten deaths and 37 wounded.<ref>Troude, vol.2, p.80.</ref><ref group=Note>In his biography of Latouche-Tr\u00e9ville, Hennequin (vol.2, p.108) gives a figure of 37 killed and 53 wounded.

South Korea experienced serious difficulties during the [[2015 Middle East respiratory syndrome outbreak in South Korea|outbreak of MERS]] in 2015 due to a lack of test kits. Afterwards, the country approved rapid deployment of COVID-19 test kits, and now they are able to test more than 10,000 people a day. In neighboring Japan, only about 2,700 people in total have been tested for COVID-19 as of 3 March. Officials in [[Seoul]] operate \"drive-through\" testing stations for quick testing. Diagnostics company Seegene Inc. is also exporting its test kits to other countries including China, Europe and the US.<ref>[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-04/south-korea-tests-hundreds-of-thousands-to-fight-virus-outbreak Virus Testing Blitz Appears to Keep Korea Death Rate Low] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200309094739/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-03-04/south-korea-tests-hundreds-of-thousands-to-fight-virus-outbreak |date=9 March 2020 }}</ref><ref>[https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/seegene-launches-kfda-approved-covid-19-assay-301005858.html Seegene launches KFDA Approved COVID-19 Assay]{{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200219191708/https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/seegene-launches-kfda-approved-covid-19-assay-301005858.html |date=19 February 2020 }}</ref>\n\n[[Agence France-Presse|AFP]] attributed the factors behind the low death rate of South Korea to the rigorous testing and the infected population profile. South Korea's widespread testing leads mild or asymptomatic cases to be identified so the proportion of dying goes down. Moreover, the infected population in the South Korea has a unique profile. Most of the country's infections are linked to the [[Shincheonji Church of Jesus]] and most of its members are young women. Statistics show that the virus is most deadly among older generations and men. So the death rate in South Korea is lower than other countries.<ref>{{cite web |title=Coronavirus: Can South Korea be a model for virus-hit countries? |date=11 March 2020 |url=https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/coronavirus-can-south-korea-be-a-model-for-virus-hit-countries |work=AFP |publisher=The Straits Times |access-date=19 March 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200313052634/https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/east-asia/coronavirus-can-south-korea-be-a-model-for-virus-hit-countries |archive-date=13 March 2020 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\n[[CNN]] reported the innovative drive-through testing for COVID-19 in the northern city of [[Goyang]], which was inspired by the drive-through counters at [[Starbucks]].<ref name=cnn20200302/> [[Reuters]] detailed the new testing facilities in South Korea.

South Korea's widespread testing leads mild or asymptomatic cases to be identified so the proportion of dying goes down. Moreover, the infected population in the South Korea has a unique profile.

The report found that the primary reason for the price increases was that the [[world economy]] had [[economic expansion|expanded]] at its fastest pace in decades, resulting in substantial increases in the demand for oil, while the [[oil production]] grew sluggishly, compounded by production shortfalls in oil-exporting countries.\n\nThe report stated that as a result of the imbalance and low [[price elasticity]], very large price increases occurred as the [[Market (economics)|market]] attempted to balance scarce [[price elasticity of supply|supply]] against growing [[price elasticity of demand|demand]], particularly in the last three years. The report forecast that this imbalance would persist in the future, leading to continued upward pressure on oil prices, and that large or rapid movements in oil prices are likely to occur even in the absence of activity by speculators.

The report forecast that this imbalance would persist in the future, leading to continued upward pressure on oil prices, and that large or rapid movements in oil prices are likely to occur even in the absence of activity by speculators.

Sony claims that this can compensate a 4.5-stop equivalent of camera shake.

Virgil took the disconnected tales of Aeneas's wanderings, his vague association with the foundation of [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] and his description as a personage of no fixed characteristics other than a scrupulous ''[[pietas]]'', and fashioned the ''Aeneid'' into a compelling [[founding myth]] or [[national epic]] that tied Rome to the legends of Troy, explained the [[Punic Wars]], glorified traditional Roman virtues, and legitimized the [[Julio-Claudian dynasty]] as descendants of the founders, heroes, and gods of Rome and Troy.\n\nThe ''Aeneid'' is widely regarded as Virgil's masterpiece<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.historyworld.net/wrldhis/PlainTextHistories.asp?ParagraphID=dto |title=History of Latin Literature |encyclopedia=HistoryWorld |accessdate=December 5, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.cornell.edu/stories/2008/05/new-translation-aeneid-restores-originals-humor-meter |title=New translation of 'Aeneid' restores Virgil's wordplay and original meter |last=Aloy |first=Daniel |newspaper=Cornell Chronicle |date=May 22, 2008 |accessdate=December 5, 2016}}</ref> and one of the greatest works of Latin literature.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usu.edu/markdamen/1320anclit/chapters/11verg.htm |title=Chapter 11: Vergil and The Aeneid |last=Damen |first=Mark |date=2004 |accessdate=December 5, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://ancienthistory.about.com/od/latinvergil/a/whyaeneid.htm |title=Why Read the Aeneid in Latin? |last=Gill |first=N.

These two halves are commonly regarded as reflecting Virgil's ambition to rival [[Homer]] by treating both the ''Odyssey''{{\u2018}}s wandering theme and the ''Iliad''{{\u2018}}s warfare themes.<ref>E.G.

Joseph Farrell has observed, \"...&nbsp;let us begin with the traditional view that Virgil's epic divides into 'Odyssean' and 'Iliadic' halves. Merely accepting this idea at face value is to mistake for a destination what Virgil clearly offered as the starting-point of a long and wondrous journey\" (\"The Virgilian Intertext\", ''Cambridge Companion to Virgil'', p. 229).</ref>\n\n===Journey to Italy (books 1\u20136)===\n\n====Theme====\nVirgil begins his poem with a statement of his theme (''Arma virumque cano&nbsp;...'', \"Of arms and the man I sing&nbsp;...\") and an invocation to the [[Muse]], falling some seven lines after the poem's inception (''Musa, mihi causas memora&nbsp;...'', \"O Muse, recount to me the causes&nbsp;...\"). He then explains the reason for the principal conflict in the story: the resentment held by the goddess [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]] against the [[Troy|Trojan]] people. This is consistent with her role throughout the [[Homer#Epics|Homeric epics]].\n\n====Book 1: Storm and Refuge====\nAlso in the manner of [[Homer]], the story proper begins ''[[in medias res]]'' (into the middle of things), with the Trojan fleet in the eastern [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]], heading in the direction of Italy. The fleet, led by [[Aeneas]], is on a voyage to find a second home. It has been foretold that in Italy he will give rise to a race both noble and courageous, a race which will become known to all nations. Juno is wrathful, because she had not been chosen in the [[judgment of Paris]], and because her favorite city, [[Carthage]], will be destroyed by Aeneas's descendants. Also, [[Ganymede (mythology)|Ganymede]], a Trojan prince, was chosen to be the cupbearer to her husband, [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]]\u2014replacing Juno's daughter, [[Hebe (mythology)|Hebe]]. Juno proceeds to [[Aeolus (son of Hippotes)|Aeolus]], King of the Winds, and asks that he release the winds to stir up a storm in exchange for a bribe ([[Nereids|Deiopea]], the loveliest of all her sea nymphs, as a wife). Aeolus agrees to carry out Juno's orders (line 77, \"My task is / To fulfill your commands\"); the storm then devastates the fleet.\n\n[[File:1875, C\u00e9zanne, Aeneas Meeting Dido at Carthage.jpg|thumb|[[Paul C\u00e9zanne]], ''Aeneas Meeting Dido at Carthage'', ca. 1875, [[Princeton University Art Museum]]]]\n[[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]] takes notice: although he himself is no friend of the Trojans, he is infuriated by Juno's intrusion into his domain, and stills the winds and calms the waters, after making sure that the winds would not bother the Trojans again, lest they be punished more harshly than they were this time. The fleet takes shelter on the coast of Africa, where Aeneas rouses the spirits of his men, reassuring them that they have been through worse situations before. There, Aeneas's mother, Venus, in the form of a huntress very similar to the goddess [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]], encourages him and recounts to him the history of Carthage. Eventually, Aeneas ventures into the city, and in the temple of Juno he seeks and gains the favor of [[Dido (Queen of Carthage)|Dido]], queen of the city. The city has only recently been founded by refugees from [[Tyre (Lebanon)|Tyre]] and will later become a great imperial rival and enemy to Rome.\n\nMeanwhile, [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] has her own plans. She goes to her son, Aeneas's half-brother [[Cupid]], and tells him to imitate [[Ascanius]] (the son of Aeneas and his first wife Creusa). Thus disguised, Cupid goes to Dido and offers the gifts expected from a guest. As Dido cradles the boy during a banquet given in honour of the [[Troy|Trojans]], Cupid secretly weakens her sworn fidelity to the soul of her late husband [[Sychaeus]], who was murdered by her brother [[Pygmalion of Tyre|Pygmalion]] back in Tyre, by inciting fresh love for Aeneas.\n\n====Book 2: The Trojan Horse and the Sack of Troy====\nIn books 2 and 3, Aeneas recounts to Dido the events that occasioned the Trojans' arrival. He begins the tale shortly after the war described in the ''[[Iliad]]''. Cunning [[Odysseus|Ulysses]] devised a way for [[Greeks|Greek]] warriors to gain entry into the walled city of Troy by hiding in a large [[Trojan Horse|wooden horse]]. The Greeks pretended to sail away, leaving a warrior, [[Sinon]], to mislead the Trojans into believing that the horse was an offering and that if it were taken into the city, the Trojans would be able to conquer Greece. The Trojan priest [[Laoco\u00f6n]] saw through the Greek plot and urged the horse's destruction, but his protests fell on deaf ears, so he hurled his spear at the horse. Then, in what would be seen by the Trojans as punishment from the gods, two serpents emerged from the sea and devoured Laoco\u00f6n, along with his two sons. The Trojans then took the horse inside the fortified walls, and after nightfall the armed Greeks emerged from it, opening the city's gates to allow the returned Greek army to slaughter the Trojans.\n\nIn a dream, [[Hector]], the fallen Trojan prince, advised Aeneas to flee with his family. Aeneas awoke and saw with horror what was happening to his beloved city. At first he tried to fight the enemy, but soon he lost his comrades and was left alone to fend off the Greeks. He witnessed the murder of [[Priam]] by Achilles' son [[Neoptolemus|Pyrrhus]]. His mother, Venus, appeared to him and led him back to his house. Aeneas tells of his escape with his son, [[Ascanius]], his wife [[Creusa (wife of Aeneas)|Creusa]], and his father, [[Anchises]], after the occurrence of various omens (Ascanius' head catching fire without his being harmed, a clap of thunder and a shooting star). At the city gates, they notice they lost Creusa, and Aeneas goes back into the city to look for her. He only encounters her ghost, who tells him that his destiny is to reach [[Hesperia (mythology)|Hesperia]], where kingship and a royal spouse await him.\n\n====Book 3: Wanderings====\nAeneas continues his account to Dido by telling how, rallying the other survivors, he built a fleet of ships and made landfall at various locations in the Mediterranean: [[Thrace]], where they find the last remains of a fellow Trojan, [[Polydorus (son of Priam)|Polydorus]]; [[Delos]], where [[Apollo]] tells them to leave and to find the land of their forefathers; [[Crete]], which they believe to be that land, and where they build their city ([[Pergamea]]) and promptly desert it after a plague proves this is not the place for them; the [[Strophades]], where they encounter the Harpy [[Celaeno]], who tells them to leave her island and to look for Italy, though, she prophecies, they won't find it until hunger forces them to eat their tables; and [[Buthrotum]]. This last city had been built in an attempt to replicate Troy. In Buthrotum, Aeneas meets [[Andromache]], the widow of [[Hector]]. She is still lamenting the loss of her valiant husband and beloved child. There, too, Aeneas sees and meets Helenus, one of [[Priam]]'s sons, who has the gift of prophecy. Through him, Aeneas learns the destiny laid out for him: he is divinely advised to seek out the land of Italy (also known as ''Ausonia'' or ''Hesperia''), where his descendants will not only prosper, but in time rule the entire known world. In addition, Helenus also bids him go to the [[Sibyl]] in [[Cumae]].\n\n[[File:Death Dido Cayot Louvre MR1780.jpg|thumb|The suicide of [[Dido (Queen of Carthage)|Queen Dido]] (book 4), sculpture by {{Interlanguage link multi|Claude-Augustin Cayot|fr}} (1667\u20131722)]]\nHeading into the open sea, Aeneas leaves Buthrotum, rounds the south eastern tip of Italy and makes his way towards [[Sicily]] (Trinacria). There, they are caught in the whirlpool of [[Charybdis]] and driven out to sea. Soon they come ashore at the land of the [[Cyclopes]]. There they meet a Greek, [[Achaemenides]], one of Ulysses' men, who has been left behind when his comrades escaped the cave of [[Polyphemus]]. They take Achaemenides on board and narrowly escape Polyphemus. Shortly after, at [[Drepana|Drepanum]], Aeneas' father Anchises dies of old age. Aeneas heads on (towards Italy) and gets deflected to Carthage (by the storm described in book 1). Here, Aeneas ends his account of his wanderings to Dido.\n\n====Book 4: Fate of Queen Dido====\nDido realises that she has fallen in love with Aeneas. Juno seizes upon this opportunity to make a deal with Venus, Aeneas's mother, with the intention of distracting Aeneas from his destiny of founding a city in Italy. Aeneas is inclined to return Dido's love, and during a hunting expedition, a storm drives them into a small covered grove in which Aeneas and Dido presumably made love, an event that Dido takes to indicate a marriage between them. But when [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] sends [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]] to remind Aeneas of his duty, he has no choice but to part. At the behest of Mercury's apparition, he leaves clandestinely at night. Her heart broken, Dido commits suicide by stabbing herself upon a [[pyre]] with Aeneas's sword. Before dying, she predicts eternal strife between Aeneas's people and hers; \"rise up from my bones, avenging spirit\" (4.625, trans. Fitzgerald) is a possible invocation to [[Hannibal]].<ref>{{cite book|author1=Publius Vergilius Maro|authorlink=Virgil|title=The Aeneid, translated by Robert Fagles, introduction by Bernard Knox|date=2006|publisher=Viking Penguin|location=New York, New York 10014, U.S.A.|isbn=978-0-14-310513-8|page=26|edition=deluxe}}</ref>\n\n====Book 5: Sicily====\nLooking back from the deck of his ship, Aeneas sees the smoke of Dido's funeral pyre, and although he does not understand the exact reason behind it, he understands it as a bad omen, considering the angry madness of her love.\n[[File:Mosaic boxers Getty Villa 71.AH.106.jpg|thumb|Boxing scene from the ''Aeneid'' (book 5), mosaic floor from a Gallo-Roman villa in [[Villelaure]] (France), ca. 175 AD, [[Getty Villa]] (71.AH.106)]]\n\nHindered by bad weather from reaching Italy, the Trojans return to where they started at the beginning of book 1. Book 5 then takes place on [[Sicily]] and centers on the [[funeral games (antiquity)|funeral games]] that Aeneas organises for the anniversary of his father's death. Aeneas organises celebratory games for the men\u2014a boat race, a foot race, a boxing match, and an archery contest. In all those contests, Aeneas is careful to reward winners and losers, showing his leadership qualities by not allowing antagonism even after foul play. Each of these contests comments on past events or prefigures future events: the boxing match, for instance, is \"a preview of the final encounter of Aeneas and Turnus\", and the dove, the target during the archery contest, is connected to the deaths of [[Polites (Prince of Troy)|Polites]] and King Priam in Book 2 and that of Camilla in Book 11.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Glazewski|first=Johanna|year=1972|title=The Function of Vergil's Funeral Games|journal=The Classical World|volume=66|issue=2|pages=85\u201396|jstor=4347751|doi=10.2307/4347751}}</ref> Afterwards, Ascanius leads the boys in a military parade and mock battle, the [[Lusus Troiae]] - a tradition he will teach the Latins while building the walls of Alba Longa.\n\nDuring these events, Juno, via her messenger Iris, who disguises herself as an old woman, incites the Trojan women to burn the fleet and prevent the Trojans from ever reaching Italy, but her plan is thwarted when Ascanius and Aeneas intervene. Aeneas prays to Jupiter to quench the fires, which the god does with a torrential rainstorm. An anxious Aeneas is comforted by a vision of his father, who tells him to go to the underworld to receive a vision of his and Rome's future. In return for safe passage to Italy, the gods, by order of Jupiter, will receive one of Aeneas's men as a sacrifice: [[Palinurus]], who steers Aeneas's ship by night, is put to sleep by [[Somnus]] and falls overboard.\n\n====Book 6: Underworld====\n{{see also|The Golden Bough (mythology)}}\nAeneas, with the guidance of the [[Cumaean Sibyl]], descends into the underworld. They pass by crowds of the dead by the banks of the river [[Acheron]] and are ferried across by [[Charon (mythology)|Charon]] before passing by [[Cerberus]], the three-headed guardian of the underworld. Then Aeneas is shown the fates of the wicked in [[Tartarus]] and is warned by the Sibyl to bow to the justice of the gods. He also meets the shade of Dido, who remains unreconcilable. He is then brought to green fields of [[Elysium]]. There he speaks with the spirit of his father and is offered a prophetic vision of the destiny of Rome.\n\n===War in Italy (books 7\u201312)===\n[[File:Aeneas Latium BM GR1927.12-12.1.jpg|thumb|Roman bas-relief, 2nd century: Aeneas lands in [[Latium]], leading [[Ascanius]]; the sow identifies the place to found his city (book 8).]]\n\n==== Book 7: Arrival in Latium and Outbreak of War ====\nUpon returning to the land of the living, Aeneas leads the Trojans to settle in [[Latium]], where King [[Latinus]] received oracles pointing towards the arrival of strangers and bidding him to marry his daughter [[Lavinia]] to the foreigners, and not to [[Turnus]], the ruler of another native people, the [[Rutuli]]. Juno, unhappy with the Trojans' favourable situation, summons the [[Erinyes|fury]] [[Alecto]] from the underworld to stir up a war between the Trojans and the locals. Alecto incites [[Amata]], the Queen of Latium and the wife of Latinus, to demand that Lavinia be married to noble Turnus, and she causes Ascanius to wound a revered deer during a hunt. Hence, although Aeneas wishes to avoid a war, hostilities break out. The book closes with a catalogue of Italic warriors.\n\n==== Book 8: Aeneas' visit to Pallanteum, the Site of Future Rome ====\nGiven the impending war, Aeneas seeks help from the Tuscans, enemies of the Rutuli, after having been encouraged to do so in a dream by [[Tiberinus (god)|Tiberinus ]]. At the place where Rome will be, he meets a friendly Greek, King [[Evander of Pallene|Evander]] of [[Arcadia]]. His son [[Pallas (son of Evander)|Pallas]] agrees to join Aeneas and lead troops against the Rutuli. Venus urges her spouse Vulcan to create weapons for Aeneas, which she then presents to Aeneas as a gift. On the [[Shield of Aeneas|shield]], the future history of Rome is depicted.\n\n==== Book 9: Turnus' Siege of the Trojan Camp ====\nMeanwhile, the Trojan camp is attacked by Turnus\u2014spurred on by [[Juno (goddess)|Juno]], who informs him that Aeneas is away from his camp\u2014and a midnight raid by the Trojans [[Nisus and Euryalus]] on Turnus' camp leads to their death. The next day, Turnus manages to breach the gates but is forced to retreat by jumping into the [[Tiber]].\n\n==== Book 10: The First Battle ====\nA council of the gods is held, in which Venus and Juno speak before Jupiter, and Aeneas returns to the besieged Trojan camp accompanied by his new Arcadian and Tuscan allies. In the ensuing battle many are slain\u2014notably Pallas, whom Evander has entrusted to Aeneas but who is killed by Turnus. [[Mezentius]], Turnus's close associate, allows his son Lausus to be killed by Aeneas while he himself flees. He reproaches himself and faces Aeneas in [[single combat]]\u2014an honourable but essentially futile endeavour leading to his death.\n\n==== Book 11: Armistice and Battle with Camilla ====\nAfter a short break in which the funeral ceremony for Pallas takes place, the war continues. Another notable native, [[Camilla (mythology)|Camilla]], an [[Amazons|Amazon]] character and virgin devoted to [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]], fights bravely but is killed, falling prey to her greed for gold. Arruns, the man who kills her, is struck dead by Diana's sentinel, [[Nereid|Opis]].\n\n[[File:Aeneas and Turnus.jpg|thumb|left|Aeneas's defeat of Turnus (book 12), painting by [[Luca Giordano]]]]\n==== Book 12: Final Battle and Duel of Aeneas and Turnus ====\nSingle combat is proposed between Aeneas and Turnus, but Aeneas is so obviously superior to Turnus that the Rutuli, urged on by Turnus's divine sister, [[Juturna]]\u2014who in turn is instigated by Juno\u2014break the truce. Aeneas is injured by an arrow but is soon healed with the help of his mother Venus and returns to the battle. Turnus and Aeneas dominate the battle on opposite wings, but when Aeneas makes a daring attack at the city of Latium (causing the queen of Latium to hang herself in despair), he forces Turnus into single combat once more. In the duel, Turnus's strength deserts him as he tries to hurl a rock, and Aeneas's spear goes through his thigh. As Turnus is on his knees, begging for his life, the epic ends with Aeneas first tempted to obey Turnus's pleas to spare his life, but then killing him in rage when he sees that Turnus is wearing his friend Pallas's belt over a shoulder as a trophy.\n{{clear}}\n\n==Reception==\n<!-- {{main|Reception of the Aeneid}} -->\nCritics of the ''Aeneid'' focus on a variety of issues.<ref>Fowler, \"Virgil\", in Hornblower and Spawnforth (eds), ''Oxford Classical Dictionary'', 3rd edition, 1996, pp. 1605\u201306</ref> The tone of the poem as a whole is a particular matter of debate; some see the poem as ultimately pessimistic and politically subversive to the [[Augustus|Augustan]] regime, while others view it as a celebration of the new imperial dynasty. Virgil makes use of the symbolism of the Augustan regime, and some scholars see strong associations between Augustus and Aeneas, the one as founder and the other as re-founder of Rome. A strong [[teleology]], or drive towards a climax, has been detected in the poem. The ''Aeneid'' is full of prophecies about the future of Rome, the deeds of Augustus, his ancestors, and famous Romans, and the [[Carthaginian Wars]]; the shield of Aeneas even depicts Augustus' victory at Actium in 31 BC. A further focus of study is the character of Aeneas. As the protagonist of the poem, Aeneas seems to constantly waver between his emotions and commitment to his prophetic duty to found Rome; critics note the breakdown of Aeneas's emotional control in the last sections of the poem where the \"pious\" and \"righteous\" Aeneas mercilessly slaughters the Latin warrior Turnus.\n\nThe ''Aeneid'' appears to have been a great success. Virgil is said to have recited Books 2, 4 and 6 to Augustus;<ref>Fowler, pg.1603</ref> the mention of her son, Marcellus, in book 6 apparently caused Augustus' sister [[Octavia the Younger|Octavia]] to faint. The poem was unfinished when Virgil died in 19 BC.\n\n==Virgil's death and editing==\n[[File:A mosaic BardoMuseum.JPG|thumb|Virgil, holding a manuscript of the ''Aeneid'', flanked by the muses [[Clio]] (history) and [[Melpomene]] (tragedy). [[Roman mosaic]], third century AD, from [[Hadrumetum]], now in the [[Bardo Museum]], [[Tunis]].]]\nAccording to tradition, Virgil traveled to Greece around 19 BC to revise the ''Aeneid''. After meeting Augustus in Athens and deciding to return home, Virgil caught a fever while visiting a town near [[Megara]]. Virgil crossed to Italy by ship, weakened with disease, and died in [[Brundisium]] harbour on 21 September&nbsp;19&nbsp;BC, leaving a wish that the manuscript of the ''Aeneid'' was to be burned. Augustus ordered Virgil's literary executors, [[Lucius Varius Rufus]] and [[Plotius Tucca]], to disregard that wish, instead ordering the ''Aeneid'' to be published with as few editorial changes as possible.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |last=Sellar |first=William Young |authorlink=William Young Sellar |author2=[[Terrot Reaveley Glover|Glover, Terrot Reaveley]] |title=Virgil |encyclopedia=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |url=https://archive.org/stream/encyclopaediabri28chisrich#page/112/mode/2up |accessdate=7 June 2012 |edition=11th |year=1911 |page=112 |volume=28}}</ref> As a result, the existing text of the ''Aeneid'' may contain faults which Virgil was planning to correct before publication. However, the only obvious imperfections are a few lines of verse that are metrically unfinished (i.e., not a complete line of [[dactylic hexameter]]). Other alleged \"imperfections\" are subject to scholarly debate.\n\n==History==\n[[File:VaticanVergilFol022rFlightFromTroy.jpg|thumb|Folio 22 from the [[Vergilius Vaticanus]]\u2014flight from Troy]]\nThe ''Aeneid'' was written in a time of major political and social change in Rome, with the fall of the [[Roman republic|Republic]] and the [[Final War of the Roman Republic]] having torn through society and many Romans' faith in the \"Greatness of Rome\" severely faltering. However, the new emperor, [[Augustus Caesar]], began to institute a new era of prosperity and peace, specifically through the re-introduction of traditional Roman moral values. The ''Aeneid'' was seen as reflecting this aim, by depicting the heroic Aeneas as a man devoted and loyal to his country and its prominence, rather than his own personal gains. In addition, the ''Aeneid'' gives mythic legitimization to the rule of [[Julius Caesar]] and, by extension, to his adopted son Augustus, by immortalizing the tradition that renamed Aeneas's son, Ascanius (called Ilus from ''Ilium'', meaning Troy), ''Iulus'', thus making him an ancestor of the ''[[gens Julia]]'', the family of Julius Caesar, and many other great imperial descendants as part of the prophecy given to him in the Underworld. (The meter shows that the name \"Iulus\" is pronounced as 3 syllables, not as \"Julus\".)\n\nThe perceived deficiency of any account of Aeneas's marriage to Lavinia or his founding of the Roman race led some writers, such as the 15th-century Italian poet [[Maffeo Vegio]] (through his ''Mapheus Vegius'' widely printed in the [[Renaissance]]), [[Pietro Candido Decembrio|Pier Candido Decembrio]] (whose attempt was never completed), Claudio Salvucci (in his 1994 epic poem ''The Laviniad''), and [[Ursula K. Le Guin]] (in her 2008 novel ''[[Lavinia (novel)|Lavinia]]'') to compose their own supplements.\n\nDespite the polished and complex nature of the ''Aeneid'' (legend stating that Virgil wrote only three lines of the poem each day), the number of half-complete lines and the abrupt ending are generally seen as evidence that Virgil died before he could finish the work. Some legends state that Virgil, fearing that he would die before he had properly revised the poem, gave instructions to friends (including the current emperor, [[Augustus]]) that the ''Aeneid'' should be burned upon his death, owing to its unfinished state and because he had come to dislike one of the sequences in Book VIII, in which [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] and [[Vulcan (mythology)|Vulcan]] made love, for its nonconformity to Roman moral virtues. The friends did not comply with Virgil's wishes and [[Augustus Caesar|Augustus]] himself ordered that they be disregarded. After minor modifications, the ''Aeneid'' was published. Because it was composed and preserved in writing rather than orally, the text exhibits less variation than other classical epics. \n\nThe first full and faithful rendering of the poem in an [[Anglic language]] is the [[Middle Scots|Scots]] translation by [[Gavin Douglas]]\u2014his ''[[Eneados]]'', completed in 1513, which also included Maffeo Vegio's supplement. Even in the 20th century, [[Ezra Pound]] considered this still to be the best ''Aeneid'' translation, praising the \"richness and fervour\" of its language and its hallmark fidelity to the original.<ref>Pound and Spann; ''Confucius to Cummings: An Anthology of Poetry'', New Directions, p. 34.</ref><ref>See [http://www.powells.com/review/2007_01_11.html Emily Wilson ''Passions and a Man''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080914044446/http://www.powells.com/review/2007_01_11.html |date=14 September 2008 }}, New Republic Online (11 January 2007), which cites Pound's claim that the translation even improved on the Virgil because Douglas had \"heard the sea\".</ref> The English translation by the 17th-century poet [[John Dryden]] is another important version. Most classic translations, including both Douglas and Dryden, employ a rhyme scheme; most more modern attempts do not.\n\nRecent English verse translations include those by British [[Poet Laureate]] [[Cecil Day-Lewis]] (1963) which strove to render Virgil's original [[hexameter]] line, [[Allen Mandelbaum]] (honoured by a 1973 [[National Book Award]]), [[Poet Laureate Consultant in Poetry to the Library of Congress|Library of Congress Poet Laureate]] [[Robert Fitzgerald]] (1981), [[Stanley Lombardo]] (2005), [[Robert Fagles]] (2006), [[Sarah Ruden]] (2008), [[Barry B. Powell]] (2015), and [[David Ferry (poet)|David Ferry]] (2017).\n\n==Style==\nAs with other classical Latin poetry, the meter is based on the length of syllables rather than the stress, though the interplay of meter and stress is also important. Virgil also incorporated such poetic devices as [[Alliteration (Latin)|alliteration]], [[onomatopoeia]], [[synecdoche]], and [[assonance]]. Furthermore, he uses [[personification]], [[metaphor]] and [[simile]] in his work, usually to add drama and tension to the scene. An example of a simile can be found in book II when Aeneas is compared to a shepherd who stood on the high top of a rock unaware of what is going on around him.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Latin/VirgilAeneidII.htm#_Toc536009313 |title=Virgil:Aeneid II |publisher=Poetryintranslation.com |date= |accessdate=27 November 2012}}</ref> It can be seen that just as the shepherd is a protector of his sheep, so too is Aeneas to his people.\n\nAs was the rule in classical antiquity, an author's style was seen as an expression of his personality and character. Virgil's Latin has been praised for its evenness, subtlety and dignity.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}\n\n===Structure===\nThe ''Aeneid'', like other classical epics, is written in [[dactylic hexameter]]s: each line consists of six metrical feet made up of [[dactyl (poetry)|dactyls]] (one long syllable followed by two short syllables) and [[spondee]]s (two long syllables). This epic consists of twelve books, and the narrative is broken up into three sections of four books each, respectively addressing Dido; the Trojans' arrival in Italy; and the war with the Latins. Each book has roughly 700\u2013900 lines. The ''Aeneid'' comes to an abrupt ending, and scholars have speculated that Virgil died before he could finish the poem.<ref>Fitzgerald 1990, 416\u201317.</ref>\n\n==Themes==\n\n===''Pietas''===\nThe Roman ideal of ''[[pietas]]'' (\"piety, dutiful respect\"), which can be loosely translated from the Latin as a selfless sense of duty toward one's\nfilial, religious, and societal obligations, was a crux of ancient Roman morality. Throughout the ''Aeneid'', Aeneas serves as the embodiment of\n''pietas'', with the phrase \"pious Aeneas\" occurring 20 times throughout the poem,<ref>\nSearch of the Latin from perseus.tufts.edu</ref> thereby fulfilling his capacity as the father of the Roman people.<ref>Hahn, E. Adelaide.  \"Pietas versus Violentia in the Aeneid.\"  ''The Classical Weekly'', 25.2 (1931): 9\u201313.</ref>\nFor instance, in Book 2 Aeneas describes how he carried his father Anchises from the burning city of Troy:  \"No help/ Or hope of help existed./\nSo I resigned myself, picked up my father,/ And turned my face toward the mountain range.\"<ref>Fitzgerald 1983, 2.1043\u20131047.</ref>  Furthermore, Aeneas ventures into the underworld, thereby fulfilling Anchises'\nwishes. His father's gratitude is presented in the text by the following lines:  \"Have you at last come, has that loyalty/ Your father counted on conquered the journey?\n<ref>Fitzgerald 1983, 6.921\u2013923.</ref>\n\nHowever, Aeneas's ''pietas'' extends beyond his devotion to his father: we also see several examples of his religious fervour. Aeneas is consistently subservient to the gods, even in actions opposed to his own desires, as he responds to one such divine command, \"I sail to Italy not of my own free will.\"<ref>Fitzgerald 1983, 4.499.</ref><ref>McLeish, Kenneth.  \"Dido, Aeneas, and the Concept of 'Pietas'.\"  ''Greece and Rome'' 19.2 (1972): 127\u2013135.</ref>\n\nIn addition to his religious and familial ''pietas'', Aeneas also displays fervent patriotism and devotion to his people, particularly in a military capacity. For instance, as he and his followers leave Troy, Aeneas swears that he will \"take up/ The combat once again. We shall not all/ Die this day unavenged.\"<ref>Fitzgerald 1983, 2.874\u2013876.</ref>\n\nAeneas is a symbol of ''pietas'' in all of its forms, serving as a moral paragon to whom a Roman should aspire.\n\n===Divine intervention===\nOne of the most recurring themes in the ''Aeneid'' is that of [[Divine providence|divine intervention]].<ref>Coleman, Robert. \"The Gods in the ''Aeneid''.\" ''Greece and Rome'' 29.2 (Oct 1982): 143\u2013168; also see Block, E. \"The Effects of Divine Manifestation on the Reader's Perspective in Vergil's ''Aeneid''\" (Salem, NH), 1984.</ref> Throughout the poem, the gods are constantly influencing the main characters and trying to change and impact the outcome, regardless of the [[fate]] that they all know will occur.<ref>Duckworth, George E. \"Fate and Free Will in Vergil's ''Aeneid''\". ''The Classical Journal'' 51.8 (1956): 357\u2013364.</ref> For example, Juno comes down and acts as a phantom Aeneas to drive Turnus away from the real Aeneas and all of his rage from the death of Pallas.<ref>Fitzgerald 1983, 10.890\u2013966.</ref> Even though Juno knows in the end that Aeneas will triumph over Turnus, she does all she can to delay and avoid this outcome.\n\nDivine intervention occurs multiple times, in Book 4 especially. Aeneas falls in love with Dido, delaying his ultimate fate of traveling to Italy. However, it is actually the gods who inspired the love, as Juno plots:\n\n<blockquote>\nDido and the Trojan captain [will come]<br />\nTo one same cavern. I shall be on hand,<br />\nAnd if I can be certain you are willing,<br />\nThere I shall marry them and call her his.<br />\nA wedding, this will be.<ref>Fitzgerald 1983, 4.173\u2013177.</ref><br />\n</blockquote>\n\nJuno is speaking to Venus, making an agreement and influencing the lives and emotions of both Dido and Aeneas. Later in the same book, Jupiter steps in and restores what is the true fate and path for Aeneas, sending Mercury down to Aeneas's dreams, telling him that he must travel to Italy and leave his new-found lover. As Aeneas later pleads with Dido:\n\n<blockquote>\nThe gods' interpreter, sent by Jove himself \u2013<br />\nI swear it by your head and mine \u2013 has brought<br />\nCommands down through the racing winds!...<br />\nI sail for Italy not of my own free will.<ref>Fitzgerald 1983, 4.492\u2013499.</ref><br />\n</blockquote>\n\nSeveral of the gods try to intervene against the powers of fate, even though they know what the eventual outcome will be. The interventions are really just distractions to continue the conflict and postpone the inevitable. If the gods represent humans, just as the human characters engage in conflicts and power struggles, so too do the gods.\n\n===Fate===\n[[Fate]], described as a preordained destiny that men and gods have to follow, is a major theme in the ''Aeneid''. One example is when Aeneas is reminded of his fate through Jupiter and Mercury while he is falling in love with Dido. Mercury urges, \"Think of your expectations of your heir,/ Iulus, to whom the whole Italian realm, the land/ Of Rome, are due.\"<ref>Fitzgerald 1983, 4.373\u2013375.</ref> Mercury is referring to Aeneas's preordained fate to found Rome, as well as Rome's preordained fate to rule the world:\n\n<blockquote>\nHe was to be ruler of Italy,<br />\nPotential empire, armorer of war;<br />\nTo father men from Teucer's noble blood<br />\nAnd bring the whole world under law's dominion.<ref>Fitzgerald 1983, 4.312\u2013315.</ref><br />\n</blockquote>\n\nIt is important to recognize that there is a marked difference between fate and divine intervention, as even though the gods might remind mortals of their eventual fate, the gods themselves are not in control of it.<ref>Fitzgerald, Robert, translator and postscript. \"Virgil's ''The Aeneid''\". New York: Vintage Books (1990). 415.</ref> For example, the opening lines of the poem specify that Aeneas \"came to Italy by destiny\", but is also harassed by the separate force of \"baleful Juno in her sleepless rage\".<ref>Fitzgerald 1983, 1.3\u20138.</ref> Even though Juno might intervene, Aeneas's fate is set in stone and cannot be changed.\n\nLater in Book 6, when Aeneas visits the underworld, his father Anchises introduces him to the larger fate of the Roman people, as contrasted against his own personal fate to found Rome:\n\n<blockquote>\nSo raptly, everywhere, father and son<br />\nWandered the airy plain and viewed it all.<br />\nAfter Anchises had conducted him<br />\nTo every region and had fired his love<br />\nOf glory in the years to come, he spoke<br />\nOf wars that he might fight, of Laurentines,<br />\nAnd of Latinus' city, then of how<br />\nHe might avoid or bear each toil to come.<ref>Fitzgerald 1983, 6.1203\u20131210.</ref><br />\n</blockquote>\n\n===Violence and conflict===\nFrom the very beginning of the ''Aeneid'', violence and conflict are used as a means of survival and conquest. Aeneas's voyage is caused by the Trojan War and the destruction of\nTroy.<ref>Scully, Stephen.  \"Refining Fire in \"Aeneid\" 8.\"  ''Vergilius (1959\u2013)'' 46 (2000): 93\u2013113.</ref>  Aeneas describes to Dido in Book 2 the massive amount of destruction that occurs after the Greeks sneak into Troy. He recalls that he asks his men to \"defend/ A city\nlost in flames. Come, let us die,/ We'll make a rush into the thick of it.\"<ref>Fitzgerald 1983, 4.469\u2013471.</ref>\nThis is one of the first examples of how violence begets violence: even though the Trojans know they have lost the battle, they continue to fight for their country.\n\nThis violence continues as Aeneas makes his journey. Dido kills herself in an excessively violent way over a pyre in order to end and escape her worldly problem: being heartbroken\nover the departure of her \"husband\" Aeneas. Queen Dido's suicide is a double edged sword. While releasing herself from the burden of her pain through violence, her last words\nimplore her people to view Aeneas's people with hate for all eternity:\n\n<blockquote>\nThis is my last cry, as my last blood flows.<br />\nThen, O my Tyrians, besiege with hate<br />\nHis progeny and all his race to come:<br />\nMake this your offering to my dust. No love,<br />\nNo pact must be between our peoples.<ref>Fitzgerald 1983, 4.864\u2013868.</ref><br />\n</blockquote>\n\nFurthermore, her people, hearing of their queen's death, have only one avenue on which to direct the blame: the already-departed Trojans. Thus, Dido's request of her people\nand her people's only recourse for closure align in their mutual hate for Aeneas and his Trojans. In effect, Dido's violent suicide leads to the violent nature of the\n[[Punic Wars|later relationship between Carthage and Rome.]]<ref>Fitzgerald, Robert, translator and postscript.  \"Virgil's The Aeneid\". New York: Vintage Books (1990). 407.</ref>\n\nFinally, when Aeneas arrives in Latium, conflict inevitably arises.<ref>Hahn, E. Adelaide.  \"Pietas versus Violentia in the Aeneid.\"  ''The Classical Weekly'', 25.2 (1931): 9.</ref>  Juno sends [[Alecto]], one of the [[Erinyes|Furies]], to cause Turnus to go against Aeneas. In the ensuing battles, Turnus\nkills Pallas, who is supposed to be under Aeneas's protection. This act of violence causes Aeneas to be consumed with fury. Although Turnus asks for mercy in their final encounter,\nwhen Aeneas sees that Turnus has taken Pallas' sword belt, Aeneas proclaims:\n\n<blockquote>\nYou in your plunder, torn from one of mine,<br />\nShall I be robbed of you?  This wound will come<br />\nFrom Pallas: Pallas makes this offering<br />\nAnd from your criminal blood exacts his due.<ref>Fitzgerald 1983, 12.1291\u20131294.</ref><br />\n</blockquote>\n\nThis final act of violence shows how Turnus' violence\u2014the act of killing Pallas\u2014inevitably leads to more violence and his own death.\n\nIt is possible that the recurring theme of violence in the ''Aeneid'' is a subtle commentary on the bloody violence contemporary readers would have just experienced during the Late Republican\n[[Roman civil wars|civil wars]].  The ''Aeneid'' potentially explores whether the violence of the civil wars was necessary to establish a lasting peace under Augustus, or whether it would just lead to more violence in the future.<ref>Pogorselski, Randall J.  \"The \"Reassurance of Fratricide\" in ''The Aeneid''.\"  ''The American Journal of Philology'' 130.2 (Summer 2009): 261\u2013289.</ref>\n\n===Propaganda===\n{{main|Political commentary of the Aeneid}}\nWritten during the reign of [[Augustus]], the ''Aeneid'' presents the hero Aeneas as a strong and powerful leader. The favorable representation of Aeneas parallels\nAugustus in that it portrays his reign in a progressive and admirable light, and allows Augustus to be positively associated with the portrayal of Aeneas.<ref>Fitzgerald, Robert, translator and postscript.  \"Virgil's The Aeneid\". New York: Vintage Books (1990). 412\u2013414.</ref>\nAlthough Virgil's patron [[Gaius Maecenas|Maecenas]] was obviously not Augustus himself, he was still a high figure within Augustus' administration and could have personally\nbenefitted from representing Aeneas in a positive light.\n\nIn the ''Aeneid'', Aeneas is portrayed as the singular hope for the rebirth of the Trojan people. Charged with the preservation of his people by divine authority, Aeneas is symbolic of Augustus' own accomplishments in establishing order after the long period of chaos of the [[Roman civil wars]]. Augustus as the light of savior and the last\nhope of the Roman people is a parallel to Aeneas as the savior of the Trojans. This parallel functions as [[propaganda]] in support of Augustus,<ref>Grebe, Sabine.  \"Augustus' Divine Authority and Virgil's ''Aeneid''.\"  ''Vergilius (1959\u2013)'' 50 (2004): 35\u201362.</ref><ref>Scully, Stephen.  \"Refining Fire in ''Aeneid'' 8.\"  ''Vergilius (1959\u2013)'' 46 (2000): 91\u2013113.</ref> as it depicts the Trojan people,\nfuture Romans themselves, as uniting behind a single leader who will lead them out of ruin:\n\n<blockquote>\nNew refugees in a great crowd: men and women<br />\nGathered for exile, young-pitiful people<br />\nComing from every quarter, minds made up,<br />\nWith their belongings, for whatever lands<br />\nI'd lead them to by sea.<ref>Fitzgerald 1983, 2.1036\u20131040.</ref><br />\n</blockquote>\n\nLater in Book 6, Aeneas travels to the underworld where he sees his father Anchises, who tells him of his own destiny as well as that of\nthe Roman people. Anchises describes how Aeneas's descendant [[Romulus]] will found the great city of Rome,\nwhich will eventually be ruled by Caesar Augustus:\n\n<blockquote>\nTurn your two eyes<br />\nThis way and see this people, your own Romans.<br />\nHere is Caesar, and all the line of Iulus,<br />\nAll who shall one day pass under the dome<br />\nOf the great sky: this is the man, this one,<br />\nOf whom so often you have heard the promise,<br />\nCaesar Augustus, son of the deified,<br />\nWho shall bring once again an Age of Gold<br />\nTo Latium, to the land where Saturn reigned<br />\nIn early times.<ref>Fitzgerald 1983, 6.1058\u20131067.</ref><br />\n</blockquote>\n\nVirgil writes about the fated future of [[Lavinium]], the city that Aeneas will found, which will in turn lead directly to the\ngolden reign of Augustus. Virgil is using a form of literary propaganda to demonstrate the Augustan\nregime's destiny to bring glory and peace to Rome. Rather than use Aeneas indirectly as a positive parallel\nto Augustus as in other parts of the poem, Virgil outright praises the emperor in Book 6, referring to Augustus as a harbinger for the glory\nof Rome and new levels of prosperity.\n\n==Allegory==\nThe poem abounds with smaller and greater allegories. Two of the debated allegorical sections pertain to the exit from the underworld and to Pallas's belt.\n\n{{quote|There are two gates of Sleep, one said to be of horn, whereby the true shades pass with ease, the other ''all white ivory agleam without a flaw, and yet false dreams are sent'' through this one by the ghost to the upper world. Anchises now, his last instructions given, took son and Sibyl and let them ''go by the Ivory Gate''.|Book VI, lines 1211\u20131218, Fitzgerald trans. (emphasis added)}}\n\nAeneas's leaving the underworld through the gate of false dreams has been variously interpreted: One suggestion is that the passage simply refers to the time of day at which Aeneas returned to the world of the living; another is that it implies that all of Aeneas's actions in the remainder of the poem are somehow \"false\". In an extension of the latter interpretation, it has been suggested that Virgil is conveying that the history of the world since the foundation of Rome is but a lie. Other scholars claim that Virgil is establishing that the theological implications of the preceding scene (an apparent system of [[reincarnation]]) are not to be taken as literal.<ref>Trans. David West, \"The Aeneid\" (1991) xxiii.</ref>\n\nThe second section in question is\n\n{{quote|Then to his glance appeared the accurst swordbelt surmounting Turnus' shoulder, shining with its familiar studs\u2014the strap Young Pallas wore when Turnus wounded him and left him dead upon the field; now Turnus bore that enemy token on his shoulder\u2014enemy still. For when the sight came home to him, Aeneas ''raged'' at the relic of his anguish worn by this man as trophy. ''Blazing up and terrible in his anger'', he called out: \"You in your plunder, torn from one of mine, shall I be robbed of you? This wound will come from Pallas: Pallas makes this offering, and from your criminal blood exacts his due.\" ''He sank his blade in fury'' in Turnus' chest&nbsp;...|Book XII, lines 1281\u20131295, Fitzgerald trans. (emphasis added)}}\n\nThis section has been interpreted to mean that for the entire passage of the poem, Aeneas who symbolizes ''pietas'' (reason) in a moment becomes ''furor'' (fury), thus destroying what is essentially the primary theme of the poem itself. Many have argued over these two sections. Some claim that Virgil meant to change them before he died, while others find that the location of the two passages, at the very end of the so-called Volume I (Books 1\u20136, the ''[[Odyssey]]''), and Volume II (Books 7\u201312, the ''[[Iliad]]''), and their short length, which contrasts with the lengthy nature of the poem, are evidence that Virgil placed them purposefully there.\n\n==Influence==\n[[File:VirgilAeneidVI.jpg|thumb|''Virgil Reading the Aeneid to Augustus and Octavia'',<ref>The anecdote, in which the poet read the passage in Book VI in praise of Octavia's late son [[Marcus Claudius Marcellus (Julio-Claudian dynasty)|Marcellus]], and Octavia fainted with grief, was recorded in the late fourth-century ''[[Biography|vita]]'' of Virgil by [[Aelius Donatus]].</ref> by [[Jean-Joseph Taillasson]], 1787, an early [[Neoclassicism|neoclassical]] painting ([[National Gallery (London)|National Gallery]], London)]]\nThe ''Aeneid'' is a cornerstone of the [[Western canon]], and early (at least by the 2nd century AD) became one of the essential elements of a Latin education,<ref>{{cite book|last=Kleinberg|first=Aviad M.|title=Flesh Made Word: Saints' Stories and the Western Imagination|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y9SFs9Tvm1UC&pg=PA68|year=2008|publisher=Harvard UP|isbn=978-0-674-02647-6|page=68}}</ref> usually required to be memorized.<ref>{{cite book|last=Montaner|first=Carlos Alberto|title=Twisted Roots: Latin America's Living Past|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eybIGmuny64C&pg=PA118|year=2003|publisher=Algora|isbn=978-0-87586-260-6|page=118}}</ref> Even after the [[decline of the Roman Empire]], it \"remained central to a Latin education\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Horsfall|first=Nicholas|title=A Companion to the Study of Virgil|url=https://archive.org/details/companiontostudy0005hors|url-access=registration|year=2000|publisher=Brill|isbn=978-90-04-11951-2|page=[https://archive.org/details/companiontostudy0005hors/page/303 303]}}</ref> In Latin-Christian culture, the ''Aeneid'' was one of the canonical texts, subjected to [[Commentary (philology)|commentary]] as a philological and educational study,<ref>{{cite book|last=Burman|first=Thomas E.|title=Reading the Qur'\u0101n in Latin Christendom, 1140\u20131560|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GtHfRxmCPesC&pg=PA84|year=2009|publisher=U of Pennsylvania P|isbn=978-0-8122-2062-9|page=84}}</ref> with the most complete commentary having been written by the 4th-century grammarian [[Maurus Servius Honoratus]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Savage|first=John J.H.|year=1932|title=The Manuscripts of the Commentary of Servius Danielis on Virgil|journal=Harvard Studies in Classical Philology|volume=43|pages=77\u2013121|jstor=310668}}</ref> It was widely held to be the pinnacle of Latin literature, much in the same way that the ''Iliad'' was seen to be supreme in Greek literature.\n\nThe strong influence of the ''Aeneid'' has been identified in the development of European vernacular literatures\u2014some English works that show its influence being ''[[Beowulf]]'', [[Layamon's Brut|Layamon's ''Brut'']] (through the source text ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]''), ''[[The Faerie Queene]]'' and [[John Milton|Milton]]'s ''[[Paradise Lost]]''. The Italian poet [[Dante Alighieri]] was himself profoundly influenced by the ''Aeneid'', so much so that his magnum opus ''[[Divine Comedy|The Divine Comedy]]'', itself widely considered central to the western canon, includes a number of quotations from and allusions to the ''Aeneid'' and features the author Virgil as a major character \u2013 the guide of Dante through the realms of the Inferno and Purgatorio. Another continental work displaying the influence of the ''Aeneid'' is the 16th-century Portuguese epic ''[[Os Lus\u00edadas]]'', written by [[Lu\u00eds de Cam\u00f5es]] and dealing with [[Vasco da Gama]]'s voyage to India.\n\nThe importance of Latin education itself was paramount in Western culture: \"from 1600 to 1900, the Latin school was at the center of European education, wherever it was found\"; within that Latin school, Virgil was taught at the advanced level and, in 19th-century England, special editions of Virgil were awarded to students who distinguished themselves.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Grafton|first1=Anthony|last2=Most|first2=Glenn W.|last3=Settis|first3=Salvatore|title=The Classical Tradition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LbqF8z2bq3sC&pg=PA297|year=2010|publisher=Harvard UP|isbn=978-0-674-03572-0|pages=294\u201397}}</ref> In the United States, Virgil and specifically the ''Aeneid'' were taught in the fourth year of a Latin sequence, at least until the 1960s;<ref>{{cite book|last=Skinner|first=Marilyn B.|title=A Companion to Catullus|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2buHe449NoAC&pg=PT448|year=2010|publisher=John Wiley|isbn=978-1-4443-3925-3|pages=448\u00e2??49}}</ref> the current (2011) [[Advanced Placement]] curriculum in Latin continues to assign a central position to the poem: \"The AP Latin: Virgil Exam is designed to test the student's ability to read, translate, understand, analyze, and interpret the lines of the ''Aeneid'' that appear on the course syllabus in Latin.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://apcentral.collegeboard.com/apc/public/repository/ap-latin-course-description.pdf|title=Latin : Virgil; Course Description|year=2011|publisher=[[College Board]]|page=14|accessdate=30 August 2011}}</ref>\n\nMany phrases from this poem entered the [[Latin]] language, much as passages from [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] and [[Alexander Pope]] have entered the English language. One example is from Aeneas's reaction to a painting of the [[sack of Troy]]: ''Sunt lacrimae rerum et mentem mortalia tangunt''\u2014\"These are the tears of things, and our mortality cuts to the heart\" (''Aeneid'' I, 462). The influence is also visible in very modern work: [[Brian Friel]]'s ''[[Translations]]'' (a play written in the 1980s, set in 19th-century Ireland), makes references to the classics throughout and ends with a passage from the ''Aeneid'':\n<blockquote>''Urbs antiqua fuit''\u2014there was an ancient city which, 'tis said, [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]] loved above all the lands. And it was the goddess's aim and cherished hope that here should be the capital of all nations\u2014should the fates perchance allow that.

The opera is famous for its aria [[Dido's Lament]] ('When I am laid in earth'), of which the first line of the melody is inscribed on the wall by the door of the [[Purcell Room]] concert hall in London.\n\nThe story of the ''Aeneid'' was made into the grand opera ''[[Les Troyens]]'' (1856\u20131858) by the French composer [[Hector Berlioz]].\n\nThe ''Aeneid'' was the basis for the 1962 Italian film ''[[The Avenger (1962 film)|The Avenger]]''.\n\nIn the musical ''[[Spring Awakening (musical)|Spring Awakening]]'', based on the [[Spring Awakening (play)|play of the same title]] by Frank Wedekind, schoolboys study the Latin text, and the first verse of Book 1 is incorporated into the number \"All That's Known\".\n\n[[Ursula K. Le Guin|Ursula Le Guin]]'s 2008 novel ''[[Lavinia (novel)|Lavinia]]'' is a free prose retelling of the last six books of the ''Aeneid'' narrated by and centered on Aeneas' Latin wife [[Lavinia]], a minor character in the epic poem. It carries the action forward to the crowning of Aeneas' younger son [[Silvius (mythology)|Silvius]] as king of Latium.\n\nA seventeenth-century popular [[broadside (music)|broadside]] [[ballad]] also appears to recount events from books 1\u20134 of the ''Aeneid,'' focusing mostly on the relationship between Aeneas and Dido. The ballad, \"[[The Wandering Prince of Troy]]\", presents many similar elements as Virgil's epic, but alters Dido's final sentiments toward Aeneas, as well as presenting an interesting end for Aeneas himself.<ref>[http://ebba.english.ucsb.edu/ballad/20276/xml Ballad Full Text] at the English Broadside Ballad Archive</ref>\n\n===Parodies and travesties===\n* A number of [[parody|parodies]] and [[burlesque|travesties]] of the ''Aeneid'' have been made.<ref>[http://www.chass.utoronto.ca/~tarn/projects/rr51-b.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090414155455/http://www.chass.utoronto.ca/~tarn/projects/rr51-b.html |date=14 April 2009 }}</ref> One of the earliest was written in Italian by [[Giovanni Batista Lalli]] in 1635, titled ''L'Eneide travestita del Signor Gio''.\n* A French parody by [[Paul Scarron]] became famous in France in the mid-17th century, and spread rapidly through Europe, accompanying the growing French influence.

Virgil took the disconnected tales of Aeneas's wanderings, his vague association with the foundation of [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] and his description as a personage of no fixed characteristics other than a scrupulous ''[[pietas]]'', and fashioned the ''Aeneid'' into a compelling [[founding myth]] or [[national epic]] that tied Rome to the legends of Troy, explained the [[Punic Wars]], glorified traditional Roman virtues, and legitimized the [[Julio-Claudian dynasty]] as descendants of the founders, heroes, and gods of Rome and Troy.\n\nThe ''Aeneid'' is widely regarded as Virgil's masterpiece<ref>{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://www.historyworld.net/wrldhis/PlainTextHistories.asp?ParagraphID=dto |title=History of Latin Literature |encyclopedia=HistoryWorld |accessdate=December 5, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://news.cornell.edu/stories/2008/05/new-translation-aeneid-restores-originals-humor-meter |title=New translation of 'Aeneid' restores Virgil's wordplay and original meter |last=Aloy |first=Daniel |newspaper=Cornell Chronicle |date=May 22, 2008 |accessdate=December 5, 2016}}</ref> and one of the greatest works of Latin literature.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.usu.edu/markdamen/1320anclit/chapters/11verg.htm |title=Chapter 11: Vergil and The Aeneid |last=Damen |first=Mark |date=2004 |accessdate=December 5, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://ancienthistory.about.com/od/latinvergil/a/whyaeneid.htm |title=Why Read the Aeneid in Latin? |last=Gill |first=N.

These two halves are commonly regarded as reflecting Virgil's ambition to rival [[Homer]] by treating both the ''Odyssey''{{\u2018}}s wandering theme and the ''Iliad''{{\u2018}}s warfare themes.<ref>E.G. Knauer, \"Vergil's ''Aeneid'' and Homer\", ''Greek, Roman, and Byzantine Studies'' 5 (1964) 61\u201384. Originating in [[Maurus Servius Honoratus|Servius]]'s observation, [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.02.0053&query=book%3D%237 tufts.edu]</ref> This is, however, a rough correspondence, the limitations of which should be borne in mind.<ref>The majority of the ''Odyssey'' is devoted to events on Ithaca, not to Odysseus' wanderings, so that the second half of the ''Odyssey'' very broadly corresponds to the second half of the ''Aeneid'' (the hero fights to establish himself in his new/renewed home). Joseph Farrell has observed, \"...&nbsp;let us begin with the traditional view that Virgil's epic divides into 'Odyssean' and 'Iliadic' halves. Merely accepting this idea at face value is to mistake for a destination what Virgil clearly offered as the starting-point of a long and wondrous journey\" (\"The Virgilian Intertext\", ''Cambridge Companion to Virgil'', p. 229).</ref>\n\n===Journey to Italy (books 1\u20136)===\n\n====Theme====\nVirgil begins his poem with a statement of his theme (''Arma virumque cano&nbsp;...'', \"Of arms and the man I sing&nbsp;...\") and an invocation to the [[Muse]], falling some seven lines after the poem's inception (''Musa, mihi causas memora&nbsp;...'', \"O Muse, recount to me the causes&nbsp;...\"). He then explains the reason for the principal conflict in the story: the resentment held by the goddess [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]] against the [[Troy|Trojan]] people. This is consistent with her role throughout the [[Homer#Epics|Homeric epics]].\n\n====Book 1: Storm and Refuge====\nAlso in the manner of [[Homer]], the story proper begins ''[[in medias res]]'' (into the middle of things), with the Trojan fleet in the eastern [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]], heading in the direction of Italy. The fleet, led by [[Aeneas]], is on a voyage to find a second home. It has been foretold that in Italy he will give rise to a race both noble and courageous, a race which will become known to all nations. Juno is wrathful, because she had not been chosen in the [[judgment of Paris]], and because her favorite city, [[Carthage]], will be destroyed by Aeneas's descendants. Also, [[Ganymede (mythology)|Ganymede]], a Trojan prince, was chosen to be the cupbearer to her husband, [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]]\u2014replacing Juno's daughter, [[Hebe (mythology)|Hebe]]. Juno proceeds to [[Aeolus (son of Hippotes)|Aeolus]], King of the Winds, and asks that he release the winds to stir up a storm in exchange for a bribe ([[Nereids|Deiopea]], the loveliest of all her sea nymphs, as a wife). Aeolus agrees to carry out Juno's orders (line 77, \"My task is / To fulfill your commands\"); the storm then devastates the fleet.\n\n[[File:1875, C\u00e9zanne, Aeneas Meeting Dido at Carthage.jpg|thumb|[[Paul C\u00e9zanne]], ''Aeneas Meeting Dido at Carthage'', ca. 1875, [[Princeton University Art Museum]]]]\n[[Neptune (mythology)|Neptune]] takes notice: although he himself is no friend of the Trojans, he is infuriated by Juno's intrusion into his domain, and stills the winds and calms the waters, after making sure that the winds would not bother the Trojans again, lest they be punished more harshly than they were this time. The fleet takes shelter on the coast of Africa, where Aeneas rouses the spirits of his men, reassuring them that they have been through worse situations before. There, Aeneas's mother, Venus, in the form of a huntress very similar to the goddess [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]], encourages him and recounts to him the history of Carthage. Eventually, Aeneas ventures into the city, and in the temple of Juno he seeks and gains the favor of [[Dido (Queen of Carthage)|Dido]], queen of the city. The city has only recently been founded by refugees from [[Tyre (Lebanon)|Tyre]] and will later become a great imperial rival and enemy to Rome.\n\nMeanwhile, [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] has her own plans. She goes to her son, Aeneas's half-brother [[Cupid]], and tells him to imitate [[Ascanius]] (the son of Aeneas and his first wife Creusa). Thus disguised, Cupid goes to Dido and offers the gifts expected from a guest. As Dido cradles the boy during a banquet given in honour of the [[Troy|Trojans]], Cupid secretly weakens her sworn fidelity to the soul of her late husband [[Sychaeus]], who was murdered by her brother [[Pygmalion of Tyre|Pygmalion]] back in Tyre, by inciting fresh love for Aeneas.\n\n====Book 2: The Trojan Horse and the Sack of Troy====\nIn books 2 and 3, Aeneas recounts to Dido the events that occasioned the Trojans' arrival. He begins the tale shortly after the war described in the ''[[Iliad]]''. Cunning [[Odysseus|Ulysses]] devised a way for [[Greeks|Greek]] warriors to gain entry into the walled city of Troy by hiding in a large [[Trojan Horse|wooden horse]]. The Greeks pretended to sail away, leaving a warrior, [[Sinon]], to mislead the Trojans into believing that the horse was an offering and that if it were taken into the city, the Trojans would be able to conquer Greece. The Trojan priest [[Laoco\u00f6n]] saw through the Greek plot and urged the horse's destruction, but his protests fell on deaf ears, so he hurled his spear at the horse. Then, in what would be seen by the Trojans as punishment from the gods, two serpents emerged from the sea and devoured Laoco\u00f6n, along with his two sons. The Trojans then took the horse inside the fortified walls, and after nightfall the armed Greeks emerged from it, opening the city's gates to allow the returned Greek army to slaughter the Trojans.\n\nIn a dream, [[Hector]], the fallen Trojan prince, advised Aeneas to flee with his family. Aeneas awoke and saw with horror what was happening to his beloved city. At first he tried to fight the enemy, but soon he lost his comrades and was left alone to fend off the Greeks. He witnessed the murder of [[Priam]] by Achilles' son [[Neoptolemus|Pyrrhus]]. His mother, Venus, appeared to him and led him back to his house. Aeneas tells of his escape with his son, [[Ascanius]], his wife [[Creusa (wife of Aeneas)|Creusa]], and his father, [[Anchises]], after the occurrence of various omens (Ascanius' head catching fire without his being harmed, a clap of thunder and a shooting star). At the city gates, they notice they lost Creusa, and Aeneas goes back into the city to look for her. He only encounters her ghost, who tells him that his destiny is to reach [[Hesperia (mythology)|Hesperia]], where kingship and a royal spouse await him.\n\n====Book 3: Wanderings====\nAeneas continues his account to Dido by telling how, rallying the other survivors, he built a fleet of ships and made landfall at various locations in the Mediterranean: [[Thrace]], where they find the last remains of a fellow Trojan, [[Polydorus (son of Priam)|Polydorus]]; [[Delos]], where [[Apollo]] tells them to leave and to find the land of their forefathers; [[Crete]], which they believe to be that land, and where they build their city ([[Pergamea]]) and promptly desert it after a plague proves this is not the place for them; the [[Strophades]], where they encounter the Harpy [[Celaeno]], who tells them to leave her island and to look for Italy, though, she prophecies, they won't find it until hunger forces them to eat their tables; and [[Buthrotum]]. This last city had been built in an attempt to replicate Troy. In Buthrotum, Aeneas meets [[Andromache]], the widow of [[Hector]]. She is still lamenting the loss of her valiant husband and beloved child. There, too, Aeneas sees and meets Helenus, one of [[Priam]]'s sons, who has the gift of prophecy. Through him, Aeneas learns the destiny laid out for him: he is divinely advised to seek out the land of Italy (also known as ''Ausonia'' or ''Hesperia''), where his descendants will not only prosper, but in time rule the entire known world. In addition, Helenus also bids him go to the [[Sibyl]] in [[Cumae]].\n\n[[File:Death Dido Cayot Louvre MR1780.jpg|thumb|The suicide of [[Dido (Queen of Carthage)|Queen Dido]] (book 4), sculpture by {{Interlanguage link multi|Claude-Augustin Cayot|fr}} (1667\u20131722)]]\nHeading into the open sea, Aeneas leaves Buthrotum, rounds the south eastern tip of Italy and makes his way towards [[Sicily]] (Trinacria). There, they are caught in the whirlpool of [[Charybdis]] and driven out to sea. Soon they come ashore at the land of the [[Cyclopes]]. There they meet a Greek, [[Achaemenides]], one of Ulysses' men, who has been left behind when his comrades escaped the cave of [[Polyphemus]]. They take Achaemenides on board and narrowly escape Polyphemus. Shortly after, at [[Drepana|Drepanum]], Aeneas' father Anchises dies of old age. Aeneas heads on (towards Italy) and gets deflected to Carthage (by the storm described in book 1). Here, Aeneas ends his account of his wanderings to Dido.\n\n====Book 4: Fate of Queen Dido====\nDido realises that she has fallen in love with Aeneas. Juno seizes upon this opportunity to make a deal with Venus, Aeneas's mother, with the intention of distracting Aeneas from his destiny of founding a city in Italy. Aeneas is inclined to return Dido's love, and during a hunting expedition, a storm drives them into a small covered grove in which Aeneas and Dido presumably made love, an event that Dido takes to indicate a marriage between them. But when [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] sends [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]] to remind Aeneas of his duty, he has no choice but to part. At the behest of Mercury's apparition, he leaves clandestinely at night. Her heart broken, Dido commits suicide by stabbing herself upon a [[pyre]] with Aeneas's sword. Before dying, she predicts eternal strife between Aeneas's people and hers; \"rise up from my bones, avenging spirit\" (4.625, trans.

Aeneas organises celebratory games for the men\u2014a boat race, a foot race, a boxing match, and an archery contest. In all those contests, Aeneas is careful to reward winners and losers, showing his leadership qualities by not allowing antagonism even after foul play. Each of these contests comments on past events or prefigures future events: the boxing match, for instance, is \"a preview of the final encounter of Aeneas and Turnus\", and the dove, the target during the archery contest, is connected to the deaths of [[Polites (Prince of Troy)|Polites]] and King Priam in Book 2 and that of Camilla in Book 11.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Glazewski|first=Johanna|year=1972|title=The Function of Vergil's Funeral Games|journal=The Classical World|volume=66|issue=2|pages=85\u201396|jstor=4347751|doi=10.2307/4347751}}</ref> Afterwards, Ascanius leads the boys in a military parade and mock battle, the [[Lusus Troiae]] - a tradition he will teach the Latins while building the walls of Alba Longa.\n\nDuring these events, Juno, via her messenger Iris, who disguises herself as an old woman, incites the Trojan women to burn the fleet and prevent the Trojans from ever reaching Italy, but her plan is thwarted when Ascanius and Aeneas intervene. Aeneas prays to Jupiter to quench the fires, which the god does with a torrential rainstorm. An anxious Aeneas is comforted by a vision of his father, who tells him to go to the underworld to receive a vision of his and Rome's future. In return for safe passage to Italy, the gods, by order of Jupiter, will receive one of Aeneas's men as a sacrifice: [[Palinurus]], who steers Aeneas's ship by night, is put to sleep by [[Somnus]] and falls overboard.\n\n====Book 6: Underworld====\n{{see also|The Golden Bough (mythology)}}\nAeneas, with the guidance of the [[Cumaean Sibyl]], descends into the underworld. They pass by crowds of the dead by the banks of the river [[Acheron]] and are ferried across by [[Charon (mythology)|Charon]] before passing by [[Cerberus]], the three-headed guardian of the underworld. Then Aeneas is shown the fates of the wicked in [[Tartarus]] and is warned by the Sibyl to bow to the justice of the gods. He also meets the shade of Dido, who remains unreconcilable. He is then brought to green fields of [[Elysium]]. There he speaks with the spirit of his father and is offered a prophetic vision of the destiny of Rome.\n\n===War in Italy (books 7\u201312)===\n[[File:Aeneas Latium BM GR1927.12-12.1.jpg|thumb|Roman bas-relief, 2nd century: Aeneas lands in [[Latium]], leading [[Ascanius]]; the sow identifies the place to found his city (book 8).]]\n\n==== Book 7: Arrival in Latium and Outbreak of War ====\nUpon returning to the land of the living, Aeneas leads the Trojans to settle in [[Latium]], where King [[Latinus]] received oracles pointing towards the arrival of strangers and bidding him to marry his daughter [[Lavinia]] to the foreigners, and not to [[Turnus]], the ruler of another native people, the [[Rutuli]]. Juno, unhappy with the Trojans' favourable situation, summons the [[Erinyes|fury]] [[Alecto]] from the underworld to stir up a war between the Trojans and the locals. Alecto incites [[Amata]], the Queen of Latium and the wife of Latinus, to demand that Lavinia be married to noble Turnus, and she causes Ascanius to wound a revered deer during a hunt. Hence, although Aeneas wishes to avoid a war, hostilities break out. The book closes with a catalogue of Italic warriors.\n\n==== Book 8: Visit to Pallanteum, the Site of Future Rome ====\nGiven the impending war, Aeneas seeks help from the Tuscans, enemies of the Rutuli, after having been encouraged to do so in a dream by [[Tiberinus (god)|Tiberinus ]]. At the place where Rome will be, he meets a friendly Greek, King [[Evander of Pallene|Evander]] of [[Arcadia]]. His son [[Pallas (son of Evander)|Pallas]] agrees to join Aeneas and lead troops against the Rutuli. Venus urges her spouse Vulcan to create weapons for Aeneas, which she then presents to Aeneas as a gift. On the [[Shield of Aeneas|shield]], the future history of Rome is depicted.\n\n==== Book 9: Turnus' Siege of the Trojan Camp ====\nMeanwhile, the Trojan camp is attacked by Turnus\u2014spurred on by [[Juno (goddess)|Juno]], who informs him that Aeneas is away from his camp\u2014and a midnight raid by the Trojans [[Nisus and Euryalus]] on Turnus' camp leads to their death. The next day, Turnus manages to breach the gates but is forced to retreat by jumping into the [[Tiber]].\n\n==== Book 10: The First Battle ====\nA council of the gods is held, in which Venus and Juno speak before Jupiter, and Aeneas returns to the besieged Trojan camp accompanied by his new Arcadian and Tuscan allies. In the ensuing battle many are slain\u2014notably Pallas, whom Evander has entrusted to Aeneas but who is killed by Turnus. [[Mezentius]], Turnus's close associate, allows his son Lausus to be killed by Aeneas while he himself flees. He reproaches himself and faces Aeneas in [[single combat]]\u2014an honourable but essentially futile endeavour leading to his death.\n\n==== Book 11: Armistice and Battle with Camilla ====\nAfter a short break in which the funeral ceremony for Pallas takes place, the war continues. Another notable native, [[Camilla (mythology)|Camilla]], an [[Amazons|Amazon]] character and virgin devoted to [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]], fights bravely but is killed, falling prey to her greed for gold. Arruns, the man who kills her, is struck dead by Diana's sentinel, [[Nereid|Opis]].\n\n[[File:Aeneas and Turnus.jpg|thumb|left|Aeneas's defeat of Turnus (book 12), painting by [[Luca Giordano]]]]\n==== Book 12: Final Battle and Duel of Aeneas and Turnus ====\nSingle combat is proposed between Aeneas and Turnus, but Aeneas is so obviously superior to Turnus that the Rutuli, urged on by Turnus's divine sister, [[Juturna]]\u2014who in turn is instigated by Juno\u2014break the truce. Aeneas is injured by an arrow but is soon healed with the help of his mother Venus and returns to the battle. Turnus and Aeneas dominate the battle on opposite wings, but when Aeneas makes a daring attack at the city of Latium (causing the queen of Latium to hang herself in despair), he forces Turnus into single combat once more. In the duel, Turnus's strength deserts him as he tries to hurl a rock, and Aeneas's spear goes through his thigh. As Turnus is on his knees, begging for his life, the epic ends with Aeneas first tempted to obey Turnus's pleas to spare his life, but then killing him in rage when he sees that Turnus is wearing his friend Pallas's belt over a shoulder as a trophy.\n{{clear}}\n\n==Reception==\n<!-- {{main|Reception of the Aeneid}} -->\nCritics of the ''Aeneid'' focus on a variety of issues.<ref>Fowler, \"Virgil\", in Hornblower and Spawnforth (eds), ''Oxford Classical Dictionary'', 3rd edition, 1996, pp. 1605\u201306</ref> The tone of the poem as a whole is a particular matter of debate; some see the poem as ultimately pessimistic and politically subversive to the [[Augustus|Augustan]] regime, while others view it as a celebration of the new imperial dynasty. Virgil makes use of the symbolism of the Augustan regime, and some scholars see strong associations between Augustus and Aeneas, the one as founder and the other as re-founder of Rome. A strong [[teleology]], or drive towards a climax, has been detected in the poem. The ''Aeneid'' is full of prophecies about the future of Rome, the deeds of Augustus, his ancestors, and famous Romans, and the [[Carthaginian Wars]]; the shield of Aeneas even depicts Augustus' victory at Actium in 31 BC. A further focus of study is the character of Aeneas. As the protagonist of the poem, Aeneas seems to constantly waver between his emotions and commitment to his prophetic duty to found Rome; critics note the breakdown of Aeneas's emotional control in the last sections of the poem where the \"pious\" and \"righteous\" Aeneas mercilessly slaughters the Latin warrior Turnus.\n\nThe ''Aeneid'' appears to have been a great success. Virgil is said to have recited Books 2, 4 and 6 to Augustus;<ref>Fowler, pg.1603</ref> the mention of her son, Marcellus, in book 6 apparently caused Augustus' sister [[Octavia the Younger|Octavia]] to faint. The poem was unfinished when Virgil died in 19 BC.\n\n==Virgil's death and editing==\n[[File:A mosaic BardoMuseum.JPG|thumb|Virgil, holding a manuscript of the ''Aeneid'', flanked by the muses [[Clio]] (history) and [[Melpomene]] (tragedy). [[Roman mosaic]], third century AD, from [[Hadrumetum]], now in the [[Bardo Museum]], [[Tunis]].]]\nAccording to tradition, Virgil traveled to Greece around 19 BC to revise the ''Aeneid''. After meeting Augustus in Athens and deciding to return home, Virgil caught a fever while visiting a town near [[Megara]]. Virgil crossed to Italy by ship, weakened with disease, and died in [[Brundisium]] harbour on 21 September&nbsp;19&nbsp;BC, leaving a wish that the manuscript of the ''Aeneid'' was to be burned. Augustus ordered Virgil's literary executors, [[Lucius Varius Rufus]] and [[Plotius Tucca]], to disregard that wish, instead ordering the ''Aeneid'' to be published with as few editorial changes as possible.<ref>{{cite encyclopedia |last=Sellar |first=William Young |authorlink=William Young Sellar |author2=[[Terrot Reaveley Glover|Glover, Terrot Reaveley]] |title=Virgil |encyclopedia=Encyclop\u00e6dia Britannica |url=https://archive.org/stream/encyclopaediabri28chisrich#page/112/mode/2up |accessdate=7 June 2012 |edition=11th |year=1911 |page=112 |volume=28}}</ref> As a result, the existing text of the ''Aeneid'' may contain faults which Virgil was planning to correct before publication. However, the only obvious imperfections are a few lines of verse that are metrically unfinished (i.e., not a complete line of [[dactylic hexameter]]). Other alleged \"imperfections\" are subject to scholarly debate.\n\n==History==\n[[File:VaticanVergilFol022rFlightFromTroy.jpg|thumb|Folio 22 from the [[Vergilius Vaticanus]]\u2014flight from Troy]]\nThe ''Aeneid'' was written in a time of major political and social change in Rome, with the fall of the [[Roman republic|Republic]] and the [[Final War of the Roman Republic]] having torn through society and many Romans' faith in the \"Greatness of Rome\" severely faltering. However, the new emperor, [[Augustus Caesar]], began to institute a new era of prosperity and peace, specifically through the re-introduction of traditional Roman moral values. The ''Aeneid'' was seen as reflecting this aim, by depicting the heroic Aeneas as a man devoted and loyal to his country and its prominence, rather than his own personal gains. In addition, the ''Aeneid'' gives mythic legitimization to the rule of [[Julius Caesar]] and, by extension, to his adopted son Augustus, by immortalizing the tradition that renamed Aeneas's son, Ascanius (called Ilus from ''Ilium'', meaning Troy), ''Iulus'', thus making him an ancestor of the ''[[gens Julia]]'', the family of Julius Caesar, and many other great imperial descendants as part of the prophecy given to him in the Underworld. (The meter shows that the name \"Iulus\" is pronounced as 3 syllables, not as \"Julus\".)\n\nThe perceived deficiency of any account of Aeneas's marriage to Lavinia or his founding of the Roman race led some writers, such as the 15th-century Italian poet [[Maffeo Vegio]] (through his ''Mapheus Vegius'' widely printed in the [[Renaissance]]), [[Pietro Candido Decembrio|Pier Candido Decembrio]] (whose attempt was never completed), Claudio Salvucci (in his 1994 epic poem ''The Laviniad''), and [[Ursula K. Le Guin]] (in her 2008 novel ''[[Lavinia (novel)|Lavinia]]'') to compose their own supplements.\n\nDespite the polished and complex nature of the ''Aeneid'' (legend stating that Virgil wrote only three lines of the poem each day), the number of half-complete lines and the abrupt ending are generally seen as evidence that Virgil died before he could finish the work. Some legends state that Virgil, fearing that he would die before he had properly revised the poem, gave instructions to friends (including the current emperor, [[Augustus]]) that the ''Aeneid'' should be burned upon his death, owing to its unfinished state and because he had come to dislike one of the sequences in Book VIII, in which [[Venus (mythology)|Venus]] and [[Vulcan (mythology)|Vulcan]] made love, for its nonconformity to Roman moral virtues. The friends did not comply with Virgil's wishes and [[Augustus Caesar|Augustus]] himself ordered that they be disregarded. After minor modifications, the ''Aeneid'' was published. Because it was composed and preserved in writing rather than orally, the text exhibits less variation than other classical epics. \n\nThe first full and faithful rendering of the poem in an [[Anglic language]] is the [[Middle Scots|Scots]] translation by [[Gavin Douglas]]\u2014his ''[[Eneados]]'', completed in 1513, which also included Maffeo Vegio's supplement. Even in the 20th century, [[Ezra Pound]] considered this still to be the best ''Aeneid'' translation, praising the \"richness and fervour\" of its language and its hallmark fidelity to the original.<ref>Pound and Spann; ''Confucius to Cummings: An Anthology of Poetry'', New Directions, p. 34.</ref><ref>See [http://www.powells.com/review/2007_01_11.html Emily Wilson ''Passions and a Man''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080914044446/http://www.powells.com/review/2007_01_11.html |date=14 September 2008 }}, New Republic Online (11 January 2007), which cites Pound's claim that the translation even improved on the Virgil because Douglas had \"heard the sea\".</ref> The English translation by the 17th-century poet [[John Dryden]] is another important version. Most classic translations, including both Douglas and Dryden, employ a rhyme scheme; most more modern attempts do not.\n\nRecent English verse translations include those by British [[Poet Laureate]] [[Cecil Day-Lewis]] (1963) which strove to render Virgil's original [[hexameter]] line, [[Allen Mandelbaum]] (honoured by a 1973 [[National Book Award]]), [[Poet Laureate Consultant in Poetry to the Library of Congress|Library of Congress Poet Laureate]] [[Robert Fitzgerald]] (1981), [[Stanley Lombardo]] (2005), [[Robert Fagles]] (2006), [[Sarah Ruden]] (2008), [[Barry B. Powell]] (2015), and [[David Ferry (poet)|David Ferry]] (2017).\n\n==Style==\nAs with other classical Latin poetry, the meter is based on the length of syllables rather than the stress, though the interplay of meter and stress is also important. Virgil also incorporated such poetic devices as [[Alliteration (Latin)|alliteration]], [[onomatopoeia]], [[synecdoche]], and [[assonance]]. Furthermore, he uses [[personification]], [[metaphor]] and [[simile]] in his work, usually to add drama and tension to the scene. An example of a simile can be found in book II when Aeneas is compared to a shepherd who stood on the high top of a rock unaware of what is going on around him.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.poetryintranslation.com/PITBR/Latin/VirgilAeneidII.htm#_Toc536009313 |title=Virgil:Aeneid II |publisher=Poetryintranslation.com |date= |accessdate=27 November 2012}}</ref> It can be seen that just as the shepherd is a protector of his sheep, so too is Aeneas to his people.\n\nAs was the rule in classical antiquity, an author's style was seen as an expression of his personality and character. Virgil's Latin has been praised for its evenness, subtlety and dignity.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}\n\n===Structure===\nThe ''Aeneid'', like other classical epics, is written in [[dactylic hexameter]]s: each line consists of six metrical feet made up of [[dactyl (poetry)|dactyls]] (one long syllable followed by two short syllables) and [[spondee]]s (two long syllables). This epic consists of twelve books, and the narrative is broken up into three sections of four books each, respectively addressing Dido; the Trojans' arrival in Italy; and the war with the Latins. Each book has roughly 700\u2013900 lines. The ''Aeneid'' comes to an abrupt ending, and scholars have speculated that Virgil died before he could finish the poem.<ref>Fitzgerald 1990, 416\u201317.</ref>\n\n==Themes==\n\n===''Pietas''===\nThe Roman ideal of ''[[pietas]]'' (\"piety, dutiful respect\"), which can be loosely translated from the Latin as a selfless sense of duty toward one's\nfilial, religious, and societal obligations, was a crux of ancient Roman morality. Throughout the ''Aeneid'', Aeneas serves as the embodiment of\n''pietas'', with the phrase \"pious Aeneas\" occurring 20 times throughout the poem,<ref>\nSearch of the Latin from perseus.tufts.edu</ref> thereby fulfilling his capacity as the father of the Roman people.<ref>Hahn, E. Adelaide.  \"Pietas versus Violentia in the Aeneid.\"  ''The Classical Weekly'', 25.2 (1931): 9\u201313.</ref>\nFor instance, in Book 2 Aeneas describes how he carried his father Anchises from the burning city of Troy:  \"No help/ Or hope of help existed./\nSo I resigned myself, picked up my father,/ And turned my face toward the mountain range.\"<ref>Fitzgerald 1983, 2.1043\u20131047.</ref>  Furthermore, Aeneas ventures into the underworld, thereby fulfilling Anchises'\nwishes. His father's gratitude is presented in the text by the following lines:  \"Have you at last come, has that loyalty/ Your father counted on conquered the journey?\n<ref>Fitzgerald 1983, 6.921\u2013923.</ref>\n\nHowever, Aeneas's ''pietas'' extends beyond his devotion to his father: we also see several examples of his religious fervour. Aeneas is consistently subservient to the gods, even in actions opposed to his own desires, as he responds to one such divine command, \"I sail to Italy not of my own free will.\"<ref>Fitzgerald 1983, 4.499.</ref><ref>McLeish, Kenneth.  \"Dido, Aeneas, and the Concept of 'Pietas'.\"  ''Greece and Rome'' 19.2 (1972): 127\u2013135.</ref>\n\nIn addition to his religious and familial ''pietas'', Aeneas also displays fervent patriotism and devotion to his people, particularly in a military capacity. For instance, as he and his followers leave Troy, Aeneas swears that he will \"take up/ The combat once again. We shall not all/ Die this day unavenged.\"<ref>Fitzgerald 1983, 2.874\u2013876.</ref>\n\nAeneas is a symbol of ''pietas'' in all of its forms, serving as a moral paragon to whom a Roman should aspire.\n\n===Divine intervention===\nOne of the most recurring themes in the ''Aeneid'' is that of [[Divine providence|divine intervention]].<ref>Coleman, Robert. \"The Gods in the ''Aeneid''.\" ''Greece and Rome'' 29.2 (Oct 1982): 143\u2013168; also see Block, E. \"The Effects of Divine Manifestation on the Reader's Perspective in Vergil's ''Aeneid''\" (Salem, NH), 1984.</ref> Throughout the poem, the gods are constantly influencing the main characters and trying to change and impact the outcome, regardless of the [[fate]] that they all know will occur.<ref>Duckworth, George E. \"Fate and Free Will in Vergil's ''Aeneid''\". ''The Classical Journal'' 51.8 (1956): 357\u2013364.</ref> For example, Juno comes down and acts as a phantom Aeneas to drive Turnus away from the real Aeneas and all of his rage from the death of Pallas.<ref>Fitzgerald 1983, 10.890\u2013966.</ref> Even though Juno knows in the end that Aeneas will triumph over Turnus, she does all she can to delay and avoid this outcome.\n\nDivine intervention occurs multiple times, in Book 4 especially. Aeneas falls in love with Dido, delaying his ultimate fate of traveling to Italy. However, it is actually the gods who inspired the love, as Juno plots:\n\n<blockquote>\nDido and the Trojan captain [will come]<br />\nTo one same cavern. I shall be on hand,<br />\nAnd if I can be certain you are willing,<br />\nThere I shall marry them and call her his.<br />\nA wedding, this will be.<ref>Fitzgerald 1983, 4.173\u2013177.</ref><br />\n</blockquote>\n\nJuno is speaking to Venus, making an agreement and influencing the lives and emotions of both Dido and Aeneas. Later in the same book, Jupiter steps in and restores what is the true fate and path for Aeneas, sending Mercury down to Aeneas's dreams, telling him that he must travel to Italy and leave his new-found lover. As Aeneas later pleads with Dido:\n\n<blockquote>\nThe gods' interpreter, sent by Jove himself \u2013<br />\nI swear it by your head and mine \u2013 has brought<br />\nCommands down through the racing winds!...<br />\nI sail for Italy not of my own free will.<ref>Fitzgerald 1983, 4.492\u2013499.</ref><br />\n</blockquote>\n\nSeveral of the gods try to intervene against the powers of fate, even though they know what the eventual outcome will be. The interventions are really just distractions to continue the conflict and postpone the inevitable. If the gods represent humans, just as the human characters engage in conflicts and power struggles, so too do the gods.\n\n===Fate===\n[[Fate]], described as a preordained destiny that men and gods have to follow, is a major theme in the ''Aeneid''. One example is when Aeneas is reminded of his fate through Jupiter and Mercury while he is falling in love with Dido. Mercury urges, \"Think of your expectations of your heir,/ Iulus, to whom the whole Italian realm, the land/ Of Rome, are due.\"<ref>Fitzgerald 1983, 4.373\u2013375.</ref> Mercury is referring to Aeneas's preordained fate to found Rome, as well as Rome's preordained fate to rule the world:\n\n<blockquote>\nHe was to be ruler of Italy,<br />\nPotential empire, armorer of war;<br />\nTo father men from Teucer's noble blood<br />\nAnd bring the whole world under law's dominion.<ref>Fitzgerald 1983, 4.312\u2013315.</ref><br />\n</blockquote>\n\nIt is important to recognize that there is a marked difference between fate and divine intervention, as even though the gods might remind mortals of their eventual fate, the gods themselves are not in control of it.<ref>Fitzgerald, Robert, translator and postscript. \"Virgil's ''The Aeneid''\". New York: Vintage Books (1990). 415.</ref> For example, the opening lines of the poem specify that Aeneas \"came to Italy by destiny\", but is also harassed by the separate force of \"baleful Juno in her sleepless rage\".<ref>Fitzgerald 1983, 1.3\u20138.</ref> Even though Juno might intervene, Aeneas's fate is set in stone and cannot be changed.\n\nLater in Book 6, when Aeneas visits the underworld, his father Anchises introduces him to the larger fate of the Roman people, as contrasted against his own personal fate to found Rome:\n\n<blockquote>\nSo raptly, everywhere, father and son<br />\nWandered the airy plain and viewed it all.<br />\nAfter Anchises had conducted him<br />\nTo every region and had fired his love<br />\nOf glory in the years to come, he spoke<br />\nOf wars that he might fight, of Laurentines,<br />\nAnd of Latinus' city, then of how<br />\nHe might avoid or bear each toil to come.<ref>Fitzgerald 1983, 6.1203\u20131210.</ref><br />\n</blockquote>\n\n===Violence and conflict===\nFrom the very beginning of the ''Aeneid'', violence and conflict are used as a means of survival and conquest. Aeneas's voyage is caused by the Trojan War and the destruction of\nTroy.<ref>Scully, Stephen.  \"Refining Fire in \"Aeneid\" 8.\"  ''Vergilius (1959\u2013)'' 46 (2000): 93\u2013113.</ref>  Aeneas describes to Dido in Book 2 the massive amount of destruction that occurs after the Greeks sneak into Troy. He recalls that he asks his men to \"defend/ A city\nlost in flames. Come, let us die,/ We'll make a rush into the thick of it.\"<ref>Fitzgerald 1983, 4.469\u2013471.</ref>\nThis is one of the first examples of how violence begets violence: even though the Trojans know they have lost the battle, they continue to fight for their country.\n\nThis violence continues as Aeneas makes his journey. Dido kills herself in an excessively violent way over a pyre in order to end and escape her worldly problem: being heartbroken\nover the departure of her \"husband\" Aeneas. Queen Dido's suicide is a double edged sword. While releasing herself from the burden of her pain through violence, her last words\nimplore her people to view Aeneas's people with hate for all eternity:\n\n<blockquote>\nThis is my last cry, as my last blood flows.<br />\nThen, O my Tyrians, besiege with hate<br />\nHis progeny and all his race to come:<br />\nMake this your offering to my dust. No love,<br />\nNo pact must be between our peoples.<ref>Fitzgerald 1983, 4.864\u2013868.</ref><br />\n</blockquote>\n\nFurthermore, her people, hearing of their queen's death, have only one avenue on which to direct the blame: the already-departed Trojans. Thus, Dido's request of her people\nand her people's only recourse for closure align in their mutual hate for Aeneas and his Trojans. In effect, Dido's violent suicide leads to the violent nature of the\n[[Punic Wars|later relationship between Carthage and Rome.]]<ref>Fitzgerald, Robert, translator and postscript.  \"Virgil's The Aeneid\". New York: Vintage Books (1990). 407.</ref>\n\nFinally, when Aeneas arrives in Latium, conflict inevitably arises.<ref>Hahn, E. Adelaide.  \"Pietas versus Violentia in the Aeneid.\"  ''The Classical Weekly'', 25.2 (1931): 9.</ref>  Juno sends [[Alecto]], one of the [[Erinyes|Furies]], to cause Turnus to go against Aeneas. In the ensuing battles, Turnus\nkills Pallas, who is supposed to be under Aeneas's protection. This act of violence causes Aeneas to be consumed with fury. Although Turnus asks for mercy in their final encounter,\nwhen Aeneas sees that Turnus has taken Pallas' sword belt, Aeneas proclaims:\n\n<blockquote>\nYou in your plunder, torn from one of mine,<br />\nShall I be robbed of you?  This wound will come<br />\nFrom Pallas: Pallas makes this offering<br />\nAnd from your criminal blood exacts his due.<ref>Fitzgerald 1983, 12.1291\u20131294.</ref><br />\n</blockquote>\n\nThis final act of violence shows how Turnus' violence\u2014the act of killing Pallas\u2014inevitably leads to more violence and his own death.\n\nIt is possible that the recurring theme of violence in the ''Aeneid'' is a subtle commentary on the bloody violence contemporary readers would have just experienced during the Late Republican\n[[Roman civil wars|civil wars]].  The ''Aeneid'' potentially explores whether the violence of the civil wars was necessary to establish a lasting peace under Augustus, or whether it would just lead to more violence in the future.<ref>Pogorselski, Randall J.  \"The \"Reassurance of Fratricide\" in ''The Aeneid''.\"  ''The American Journal of Philology'' 130.2 (Summer 2009): 261\u2013289.</ref>\n\n===Propaganda===\n{{main|Political commentary of the Aeneid}}\nWritten during the reign of [[Augustus]], the ''Aeneid'' presents the hero Aeneas as a strong and powerful leader. The favorable representation of Aeneas parallels\nAugustus in that it portrays his reign in a progressive and admirable light, and allows Augustus to be positively associated with the portrayal of Aeneas.<ref>Fitzgerald, Robert, translator and postscript.  \"Virgil's The Aeneid\". New York: Vintage Books (1990). 412\u2013414.</ref>\nAlthough Virgil's patron [[Gaius Maecenas|Maecenas]] was obviously not Augustus himself, he was still a high figure within Augustus' administration and could have personally\nbenefitted from representing Aeneas in a positive light.\n\nIn the ''Aeneid'', Aeneas is portrayed as the singular hope for the rebirth of the Trojan people. Charged with the preservation of his people by divine authority, Aeneas is symbolic of Augustus' own accomplishments in establishing order after the long period of chaos of the [[Roman civil wars]]. Augustus as the light of savior and the last\nhope of the Roman people is a parallel to Aeneas as the savior of the Trojans. This parallel functions as [[propaganda]] in support of Augustus,<ref>Grebe, Sabine.  \"Augustus' Divine Authority and Virgil's ''Aeneid''.\"  ''Vergilius (1959\u2013)'' 50 (2004): 35\u201362.</ref><ref>Scully, Stephen.  \"Refining Fire in ''Aeneid'' 8.\"  ''Vergilius (1959\u2013)'' 46 (2000): 91\u2013113.</ref> as it depicts the Trojan people,\nfuture Romans themselves, as uniting behind a single leader who will lead them out of ruin:\n\n<blockquote>\nNew refugees in a great crowd: men and women<br />\nGathered for exile, young-pitiful people<br />\nComing from every quarter, minds made up,<br />\nWith their belongings, for whatever lands<br />\nI'd lead them to by sea.<ref>Fitzgerald 1983, 2.1036\u20131040.</ref><br />\n</blockquote>\n\nLater in Book 6, Aeneas travels to the underworld where he sees his father Anchises, who tells him of his own destiny as well as that of\nthe Roman people. Anchises describes how Aeneas's descendant [[Romulus]] will found the great city of Rome,\nwhich will eventually be ruled by Caesar Augustus:\n\n<blockquote>\nTurn your two eyes<br />\nThis way and see this people, your own Romans.<br />\nHere is Caesar, and all the line of Iulus,<br />\nAll who shall one day pass under the dome<br />\nOf the great sky: this is the man, this one,<br />\nOf whom so often you have heard the promise,<br />\nCaesar Augustus, son of the deified,<br />\nWho shall bring once again an Age of Gold<br />\nTo Latium, to the land where Saturn reigned<br />\nIn early times.<ref>Fitzgerald 1983, 6.1058\u20131067.</ref><br />\n</blockquote>\n\nVirgil writes about the fated future of [[Lavinium]], the city that Aeneas will found, which will in turn lead directly to the\ngolden reign of Augustus. Virgil is using a form of literary propaganda to demonstrate the Augustan\nregime's destiny to bring glory and peace to Rome. Rather than use Aeneas indirectly as a positive parallel\nto Augustus as in other parts of the poem, Virgil outright praises the emperor in Book 6, referring to Augustus as a harbinger for the glory\nof Rome and new levels of prosperity.\n\n==Allegory==\nThe poem abounds with smaller and greater allegories. Two of the debated allegorical sections pertain to the exit from the underworld and to Pallas's belt.\n\n{{quote|There are two gates of Sleep, one said to be of horn, whereby the true shades pass with ease, the other ''all white ivory agleam without a flaw, and yet false dreams are sent'' through this one by the ghost to the upper world. Anchises now, his last instructions given, took son and Sibyl and let them ''go by the Ivory Gate''.|Book VI, lines 1211\u20131218, Fitzgerald trans. (emphasis added)}}\n\nAeneas's leaving the underworld through the gate of false dreams has been variously interpreted: One suggestion is that the passage simply refers to the time of day at which Aeneas returned to the world of the living; another is that it implies that all of Aeneas's actions in the remainder of the poem are somehow \"false\". In an extension of the latter interpretation, it has been suggested that Virgil is conveying that the history of the world since the foundation of Rome is but a lie. Other scholars claim that Virgil is establishing that the theological implications of the preceding scene (an apparent system of [[reincarnation]]) are not to be taken as literal.<ref>Trans. David West, \"The Aeneid\" (1991) xxiii.</ref>\n\nThe second section in question is\n\n{{quote|Then to his glance appeared the accurst swordbelt surmounting Turnus' shoulder, shining with its familiar studs\u2014the strap Young Pallas wore when Turnus wounded him and left him dead upon the field; now Turnus bore that enemy token on his shoulder\u2014enemy still. For when the sight came home to him, Aeneas ''raged'' at the relic of his anguish worn by this man as trophy. ''Blazing up and terrible in his anger'', he called out: \"You in your plunder, torn from one of mine, shall I be robbed of you? This wound will come from Pallas: Pallas makes this offering, and from your criminal blood exacts his due.\" ''He sank his blade in fury'' in Turnus' chest&nbsp;...|Book XII, lines 1281\u20131295, Fitzgerald trans. (emphasis added)}}\n\nThis section has been interpreted to mean that for the entire passage of the poem, Aeneas who symbolizes ''pietas'' (reason) in a moment becomes ''furor'' (fury), thus destroying what is essentially the primary theme of the poem itself. Many have argued over these two sections. Some claim that Virgil meant to change them before he died, while others find that the location of the two passages, at the very end of the so-called Volume I (Books 1\u20136, the ''[[Odyssey]]''), and Volume II (Books 7\u201312, the ''[[Iliad]]''), and their short length, which contrasts with the lengthy nature of the poem, are evidence that Virgil placed them purposefully there.\n\n==Influence==\n[[File:VirgilAeneidVI.jpg|thumb|''Virgil Reading the Aeneid to Augustus and Octavia'',<ref>The anecdote, in which the poet read the passage in Book VI in praise of Octavia's late son [[Marcus Claudius Marcellus (Julio-Claudian dynasty)|Marcellus]], and Octavia fainted with grief, was recorded in the late fourth-century ''[[Biography|vita]]'' of Virgil by [[Aelius Donatus]].</ref> by [[Jean-Joseph Taillasson]], 1787, an early [[Neoclassicism|neoclassical]] painting ([[National Gallery (London)|National Gallery]], London)]]\nThe ''Aeneid'' is a cornerstone of the [[Western canon]], and early (at least by the 2nd century AD) became one of the essential elements of a Latin education,<ref>{{cite book|last=Kleinberg|first=Aviad M.|title=Flesh Made Word: Saints' Stories and the Western Imagination|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y9SFs9Tvm1UC&pg=PA68|year=2008|publisher=Harvard UP|isbn=978-0-674-02647-6|page=68}}</ref> usually required to be memorized.<ref>{{cite book|last=Montaner|first=Carlos Alberto|title=Twisted Roots: Latin America's Living Past|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eybIGmuny64C&pg=PA118|year=2003|publisher=Algora|isbn=978-0-87586-260-6|page=118}}</ref> Even after the [[decline of the Roman Empire]], it \"remained central to a Latin education\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Horsfall|first=Nicholas|title=A Companion to the Study of Virgil|url=https://archive.org/details/companiontostudy0005hors|url-access=registration|year=2000|publisher=Brill|isbn=978-90-04-11951-2|page=[https://archive.org/details/companiontostudy0005hors/page/303 303]}}</ref> In Latin-Christian culture, the ''Aeneid'' was one of the canonical texts, subjected to [[Commentary (philology)|commentary]] as a philological and educational study,<ref>{{cite book|last=Burman|first=Thomas E.|title=Reading the Qur'\u0101n in Latin Christendom, 1140\u20131560|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GtHfRxmCPesC&pg=PA84|year=2009|publisher=U of Pennsylvania P|isbn=978-0-8122-2062-9|page=84}}</ref> with the most complete commentary having been written by the 4th-century grammarian [[Maurus Servius Honoratus]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Savage|first=John J.H.|year=1932|title=The Manuscripts of the Commentary of Servius Danielis on Virgil|journal=Harvard Studies in Classical Philology|volume=43|pages=77\u2013121|jstor=310668}}</ref> It was widely held to be the pinnacle of Latin literature, much in the same way that the ''Iliad'' was seen to be supreme in Greek literature.\n\nThe strong influence of the ''Aeneid'' has been identified in the development of European vernacular literatures\u2014some English works that show its influence being ''[[Beowulf]]'', [[Layamon's Brut|Layamon's ''Brut'']] (through the source text ''[[Historia Regum Britanniae]]''), ''[[The Faerie Queene]]'' and [[John Milton|Milton]]'s ''[[Paradise Lost]]''. The Italian poet [[Dante Alighieri]] was himself profoundly influenced by the ''Aeneid'', so much so that his magnum opus ''[[Divine Comedy|The Divine Comedy]]'', itself widely considered central to the western canon, includes a number of quotations from and allusions to the ''Aeneid'' and features the author Virgil as a major character \u2013 the guide of Dante through the realms of the Inferno and Purgatorio. Another continental work displaying the influence of the ''Aeneid'' is the 16th-century Portuguese epic ''[[Os Lus\u00edadas]]'', written by [[Lu\u00eds de Cam\u00f5es]] and dealing with [[Vasco da Gama]]'s voyage to India.\n\nThe importance of Latin education itself was paramount in Western culture: \"from 1600 to 1900, the Latin school was at the center of European education, wherever it was found\"; within that Latin school, Virgil was taught at the advanced level and, in 19th-century England, special editions of Virgil were awarded to students who distinguished themselves.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Grafton|first1=Anthony|last2=Most|first2=Glenn W.|last3=Settis|first3=Salvatore|title=The Classical Tradition|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LbqF8z2bq3sC&pg=PA297|year=2010|publisher=Harvard UP|isbn=978-0-674-03572-0|pages=294\u201397}}</ref> In the United States, Virgil and specifically the ''Aeneid'' were taught in the fourth year of a Latin sequence, at least until the 1960s;<ref>{{cite book|last=Skinner|first=Marilyn B.|title=A Companion to Catullus|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2buHe449NoAC&pg=PT448|year=2010|publisher=John Wiley|isbn=978-1-4443-3925-3|pages=448\u00e2??49}}</ref> the current (2011) [[Advanced Placement]] curriculum in Latin continues to assign a central position to the poem: \"The AP Latin: Virgil Exam is designed to test the student's ability to read, translate, understand, analyze, and interpret the lines of the ''Aeneid'' that appear on the course syllabus in Latin.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://apcentral.collegeboard.com/apc/public/repository/ap-latin-course-description.pdf|title=Latin : Virgil; Course Description|year=2011|publisher=[[College Board]]|page=14|accessdate=30 August 2011}}</ref>\n\nMany phrases from this poem entered the [[Latin]] language, much as passages from [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] and [[Alexander Pope]] have entered the English language. One example is from Aeneas's reaction to a painting of the [[sack of Troy]]: ''Sunt lacrimae rerum et mentem mortalia tangunt''\u2014\"These are the tears of things, and our mortality cuts to the heart\" (''Aeneid'' I, 462). The influence is also visible in very modern work: [[Brian Friel]]'s ''[[Translations]]'' (a play written in the 1980s, set in 19th-century Ireland), makes references to the classics throughout and ends with a passage from the ''Aeneid'':\n<blockquote>''Urbs antiqua fuit''\u2014there was an ancient city which, 'tis said, [[Juno (mythology)|Juno]] loved above all the lands. And it was the goddess's aim and cherished hope that here should be the capital of all nations\u2014should the fates perchance allow that. Yet in truth she discovered that a race was springing from Trojan blood to overthrow some day these Tyrian towers\u2014a people ''late regem belloque superbum''\u2014kings of broad realms and proud in war who would come forth for Libya's downfall.<ref>{{cite journal|last=McGrath|first=F.

The opera is famous for its aria [[Dido's Lament]] ('When I am laid in earth'), of which the first line of the melody is inscribed on the wall by the door of the [[Purcell Room]] concert hall in London.\n\nThe story of the ''Aeneid'' was made into the grand opera ''[[Les Troyens]]'' (1856\u20131858) by the French composer [[Hector Berlioz]].\n\nThe ''Aeneid'' was the basis for the 1962 Italian film ''[[The Avenger (1962 film)|The Avenger]]''.\n\nIn the musical ''[[Spring Awakening (musical)|Spring Awakening]]'', based on the [[Spring Awakening (play)|play of the same title]] by Frank Wedekind, schoolboys study the Latin text, and the first verse of Book 1 is incorporated into the number \"All That's Known\".\n\n[[Ursula K. Le Guin|Ursula Le Guin]]'s 2008 novel ''[[Lavinia (novel)|Lavinia]]'' is a free prose retelling of the last six books of the ''Aeneid'' narrated by and centered on Aeneas' Latin wife [[Lavinia]], a minor character in the epic poem. It carries the action forward to the crowning of Aeneas' younger son [[Silvius (mythology)|Silvius]] as king of Latium.\n\nA seventeenth-century popular [[broadside (music)|broadside]] [[ballad]] also appears to recount events from books 1\u20134 of the ''Aeneid,'' focusing mostly on the relationship between Aeneas and Dido. The ballad, \"[[The Wandering Prince of Troy]]\", presents many similar elements as Virgil's epic, but alters Dido's final sentiments toward Aeneas, as well as presenting an interesting end for Aeneas himself.<ref>[http://ebba.english.ucsb.edu/ballad/20276/xml Ballad Full Text] at the English Broadside Ballad Archive</ref>\n\n===Parodies and travesties===\n* A number of [[parody|parodies]] and [[burlesque|travesties]] of the ''Aeneid'' have been made.<ref>[http://www.chass.utoronto.ca/~tarn/projects/rr51-b.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090414155455/http://www.chass.utoronto.ca/~tarn/projects/rr51-b.html |date=14 April 2009 }}</ref> One of the earliest was written in Italian by [[Giovanni Batista Lalli]] in 1635, titled ''L'Eneide travestita del Signor Gio''.\n* A French parody by [[Paul Scarron]] became famous in France in the mid-17th century, and spread rapidly through Europe, accompanying the growing French influence.

Congress granted approval by an act on March 3, 1817 that allowed them to buy four townships in the [[Alabama Territory]] at $2 per acre, with the provision that they cultivate grape vines and olive trees. Following advice obtained from experienced Western pioneers, they determined that Alabama would provide a good climate for cultivating these crops.  By July 14, 1817, a small party of pioneers had settled at [[White Bluff (Demopolis, Alabama)|White Bluff]] on the Tombigbee River, at the present site of Demopolis, founding the [[Vine and Olive Colony]].<ref name=\"vine1\">Smith, Winston. ''Days of Exile: The Story of the Vine and Olive Colony in Alabama'', pages 31\u201343. Tuscaloosa, Alabama: W. B. Drake and Son, 1967.</ref>\n\nMost prominent and wealthiest among the immigrants was [[Charles, comte Lefebvre-Desnouettes|Count Lefebvre Desnouettes]], who had been a cavalry officer with the rank of Lieutenant-General, under [[Napoleon]]. Considered Napoleon's best friend, he had ridden in Napoleon's carriage during his failed invasion of Russia. Other prominent figures among them included Lieutenant-General Baron [[Charles Lallemand|Henri-Dominique Lallemand]], Count [[Bertrand Clausel]], [[Joseph Lakanal]], Simon Chaudron, Pasqual Luciani, Colonel Jean-Jerome Cluis, Jean-Marie Chapron, Colonel Nicholas Raoul, and Frederic Ravesies.  Most of these expatriates had little interest in pioneer life and sold their shares in the colony, remaining in Philadelphia.<ref name=\"vine2\">Smith, ''Days of Exile'', 96\u2013115.</ref> By 1818, the colony consisted of only 69 settlers.<ref name=\"eoa1\">{{Cite web|last= Blaufarb|first= Rafe |url= http://www.encyclopediaofalabama.org/face/Article.jsp?id=h-1539 |title=Vine and Olive Colony |work=Encyclopedia of Alabama|publisher= Auburn University |date= May 19, 2008 |accessdate=October 5, 2010}}</ref>\n\nDue to a variety of adversities, their pioneering efforts were not the great success for which they had hoped. Following a survey in August 1818, they were to find that their new homes did not fall under the territories encompassed by the congressional approval, and the Vine and Olive Colony was soon forced to move. They learned that their actual land grants began less than a mile to the east of their newly cleared land.  After abandoning the settlement of Demopolis, they soon established two other towns, [[Aigleville (Alabama)|Aigleville]] and [[Arcola, Alabama|Arcola]].<ref name=\"vine3\">Smith, ''Days of Exile'', 47\u201353.</ref>\n\n===American settlement===\n[[File:White Bluff at Demopolis in 1903.jpg|thumb|[[White Bluff (Demopolis, Alabama)|White Bluff]] at Demopolis in 1903.]]\nUpon learning of the survey and that the French grants lay elsewhere, American settlers began to quickly purchase the property of the former French settlement with the intent of turning it into a major river port.  A land company was formed in 1819 with the express purpose of purchasing the land and laying off of a town, the White Bluff Association (later renamed the Company of the Town of Demopolis). [[George Strother Gaines]] was named as the company spokesman and he bought the town site atop White Bluff as soon as it offered for sale.  Commissioners for the company were George Strother Gaines, James Childress, Walter Crenshaw, Count Charles Lefebvre Desnouettes, and Dr. Joseph B. Earle.<ref name=\"peoplescity\"/>\n\nThe commissioners were responsible for overseeing the survey of the site, lot sales, and the early operations of the town.  The commissioners laid off the site into streets, blocks, and lots, with a block of roughly two acres divided into eight lots.  The [[Demopolis Town Square]], encompassing one city block, was established in 1819.  The first lots were sold beginning on April 22, 1819. When Count Desnouettes died in 1822, Allen Glover was appointed to replace him.  As other commissioners retired they were succeeded by David E. Moore, William H. Lyon, Thomas McGee, and George N. Stewart.<ref name=\"peoplescity\"/>\n\nThe streets were laid off utilizing a [[grid plan]], using Philadelphia as a model.  The original streets running north-south were named for trees, such as Ash, Cedar, Cherry, and Chestnut. Exceptions were made for Commissioners, Strawberry, and Market (now Main) streets. Several short north-south streets were also named for commissioners, such as Desnouettes, Earle, Glover, Griffin, and McGee.  The east-west streets were named for national and local heroes, as well as commissioners, such as Childress, Fulton, Gaines, Lyon, Monroe, Washington, Franklin, Jefferson, and Jackson.  Most streets were designed to be {{convert|66|ft|m}} wide.  A strip of land that remained public property, for the use of all, was the land adjoining the Tombigbee River from where Riverside Cemetery is today, to the southwest of the city proper, all the way to the Upper Landing in the north, with Arch Street following the route along the top of the cliff.  Only the portion of Arch Street adjacent to the cemetery remains intact.<ref name=\"peoplescity\"/>\n\n[[File:Bluff Hall 01.jpg|thumb|left|[[Bluff Hall]] in 2008]]\nSome flaws and limitations of the original town plan had become apparent by the late 1820s and 1830s. The typical town lots, at {{convert|75|ft|m}} wide and {{convert|150|ft|m}} deep were not conducive to the building of the stately homes desired by the more prosperous citizens of the town, although some grand mansions did begin to appear by the late 1820s.  One of the first was the brick {{frac|2|1|2}}-story [[Federal architecture|Federal]]-style Allen Glover house at the foot of Capitol street.  It was one of the, if not the first neoclassical structure to appear in Marengo County.  It was soon followed by [[Bluff Hall]], built in 1832 by Allen Glover for his daughter, Sarah Serena, and son-in-law, [[Francis Strother Lyon]].<ref name=\"peoplescity\"/>\n\nOne major flaw in the town plan was that there was no clearly defined business district, resulting in commercial and residential buildings mixed together all over town.  This eventually resulted in numerous blighted areas. Some stores did open around the town square, however, and warehouses started to appear adjacent to the town's three major river landings, Upper Landing, above the modern Demopolis Yacht Basin and Marina, Webb's Landing at the western terminus of Washington Street, and Lower Landing to the west of Riverside Cemetery and the Whitfield Canal.<ref name=\"peoplescity\"/><ref name=\"gnis1\">{{Gnis|137596|Demopolis Upper Landing}}</ref><ref name=\"gnis2\">{{Gnis|157225|Webb's Landing}}</ref><ref name=\"gnis3\">{{Gnis|137595|Demopolis Lower Landing (historical)}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Gaineswood by Highsmith 007.jpg|thumb|Nathan B. Whitfield's [[Gaineswood]] in 2010, built from 1843\u201361 on what was then the outskirts of town.]]\nBy the 1830s Demopolis had developed into a regional commercial river hub, attracting American and European-born craftsmen and merchants including the Beysiegle, Breitling, Breton, Dupertuis, Foster, Hummell, Kirker, Knapp, Marx, Michael, Mulligan, Oberling, Rhodes, Rudisill, Rosenbaum, Schmidt, Shahan, Stallings, and Zaiser families. Numerous [[List of plantations in Alabama|plantation]] owners also established townhouses in the community or on its outskirts, including the Allen, Ashe, Curtis, DuBose, Foscue, Glover, Griffin, Lane, Lyon, McAllister, Prout, Reese, Strudwick, [[Tayloe (disambiguation)|Tayloe]], Whitfield, and Vaughan families.  However, unlike many other towns in the Canebrake and Black Belt, Demopolis was never overwhelmed by a homogeneous planter class that came to dominate so many of the others.  During these years and those to come, the rivers brought in a large itinerant population with a desire for raucous entertainment.  This created a profitable and brisk trade for those operating taverns and did much to earn early Demopolis a reputation for decadence.<ref name=\"peoplescity\"/>\n\nDuring the 1840s many of the streets laid out by the town fathers had yet to be opened to traffic.  The town council focused much of its attention on clearing the intended streets of obstacles and opening them to traffic, other street improvements, and the building of wooden sidewalks along major thoroughfares. The council also approved measures for protecting trees in the common areas and streets. Several town ordinances were enacted in 1842 to further restrain the [[History of slavery in Alabama|enslaved]] African American population.  These included the prohibition of selling or purchasing any article or commodity from or to a slave without written permission from their master or overseer, no slave was allowed to purchase alcohol without written consent, if any slave were convicted of assault upon \"any white man, [[negro]], or [[mulatto]]\" the owner would be fined $50, any slave caught running \"any horse, [[gelding]], or [[mule]]\" through town would be subject to fifteen [[flagellation|lashes]] unless the owner pays a fine of $1, any slave caught driving any wagon or cart or driving a horse or mule on or across the sidewalks of the town would be subject to 10 lashes unless the owner pays a fine of 50 cents.<ref name=\"peoplescity\"/>\n\n[[File:Trinity Episcopal Demopolis 02.JPG|thumb|left|Trinity Episcopal Church, this structure was built in 1870 after the previous building burned in 1865 during the occupation of the city by Federal troops.]]\nWith its eclectic mix of citizenry, Demopolis was slow to erect houses of worship.  In fact, a group of [[United Methodist Church|Methodist]] ministers convened nearby in 1843 pronounced Demopolis as \"wholly irreligious.\"  Mainline Protestant churches were slow to take root, in fact, no churches at all were built in Demopolis until 1840.  Prior to that time, various denominational groups met in a log assembly house on the town square until it was torn down in 1844.  A [[Baptist]] group had been established in the 1820s but ended due to a lack of support.  The [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopalians]] established a congregation in 1834, but did not build their Trinity Episcopal Church until 1850.  A [[Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.)|Presbyterian]] congregation was established in 1839 and completed their first church, a brick structure now known as Rooster Hall, on the town square in 1843.  The Methodist congregation was established in 1840 and the first building was completed in 1843.<ref name=\"peoplescity2\">Smith, ''The Peoples City''</ref>{{rp|6\u20138}}  Present in Demopolis from the beginning, the Catholic congregation in town was listed as a mission of Saint John the Baptist in [[Tuscaloosa, Alabama|Tuscaloosa]] in 1851. It was switched to [[Selma, Alabama|Selma]] in 1880. They met in a small frame church and private homes until the current Saint Leo the Great was built in 1905.  The Jewish congregation, [[Temple B'nai Jeshurun (Demopolis, Alabama)|B'nai Jeshurun]], was established in 1858, although the community had been present since the 1840s. B'nai Jeshurun was the fourth Jewish congregation established in Alabama.<ref name=\"MSJEOVER\">{{cite web |url=http://www.isjl.org/history/archive/main_al.htm |title=Alabama |work=Encyclopedia of Southern Jewish Communities  |publisher=Goldring / Woldenberg Institute of Southern Jewish Life |accessdate=October 5, 2010}}</ref>  They initially met in homes and businesses until eventually building a [[Moorish Revival architecture|Moorish Revival]]-style temple in 1893.<ref name=\"peoplescity2\"/>{{rp|6\u20138}}<ref>Marengo County Heritage Book Committee: ''The heritage of Marengo County, Alabama'', pages 34\u201346.

These included the ''Forest Monarch'', ''Alice Vivian'', and the ill-fated ''[[Eliza Battle]]''.  Several others were dedicated to almost exclusively to Demopolis and the cotton trade, including the ''Allen Glover'', ''Canebrake'', ''Cherokee'', ''Demopolis'', ''Frank Lyon'', ''Marengo'', and the ''Mollie Glover''.  Major hotels during this same period included the Planter's Hotel, later known as Madison House Hotel, and the River Hotel.<ref name=\"peoplescity5\">Smith, ''The Peoples City'', 16\u201319</ref>\n\nThe year 1853 saw a [[yellow fever]] epidemic strike the city, with some interments in an ill-defined two-acre cemetery to the north of town in the river bend.  The Jewish Cemetery was established in 1878 to the east of town on Jefferson Street.  The [[Glover Mausoleum]] was completed on the banks of the Tombigbee in 1845, with the burial of many family members in and around it. This led to the establishment of the main burial ground for the city, Riverside Cemetery, officially opened with the sale of additional plots to the public in 1882.<ref name=\"peoplescity\"/>  A circular [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]]-style [[amphitheater]], complete with a [[battlement|crenelated]] roof-line, was completed in 1859 north of town in Webb's Bend at the fairgrounds.  The fairgrounds and its buildings covered approximately {{convert|20|acre}} and hosted a variety of events until the outbreak of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].<ref name=\"peoplescity6\">Smith, ''The Peoples City'', 73\u201374.</ref>\n\nBy 1860, the population within the town limits had grown to approximately 1,200 people.<ref name=\"peoplescity2\"/>{{rp|339}}  The wealthiest citizens were, in order from the highest real and property values, Gaius Whitfield, Goodman G.

These feelings ran high in the county's largest town also.  Prominent secessionists included Nathan B. Whitfield, Francis S. Lyon, Goodman G. Griffin, Kimbrough C. DuBose, George B. Lyon, Dr. James D. Browder, and George E. Markham.  However, many other powerful men in town had opposed secession, including Benjamin Glover Shields, William H. Lyon, Jr., William B. Jones, Pearson J. Glover, Gaius Whitfield, Alfred Hatch, Joel C. DuBose, Robert V. Montague, and [[Henry Augustine Tayloe]].  In the end, however, most men on both sides of the argument joined in the Confederate cause once secession was inevitable.<ref name=\"peoplescity7\">Smith, ''The Peoples City'', 129\u2013218.</ref>\n\n[[File:Rooster Hall.JPG|thumb|Rooster Hall in 2010, it was built in 1843 as the Presbyterian church and then served as the county courthouse from 1868\u201371.]]\nWith the start of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], several Confederate companies drew heavily from the population of the Demopolis area and Marengo County.  These included the 4th, 11th, 21st, 23rd, and 43rd Alabama Infantry Regiments in addition to the 8th Alabama Cavalry, Company E of the Jeff Davis Legion, and Selden's Battery.  During the course of the war, more of these men would be lost to exhaustion, disease, and malnutrition than to battle.  The city itself, on two navigable rivers and a railroad, became home to a number of Confederate installations and offices.  These included [[commissary]] and [[quartermaster]] offices and warehouses, engineers' offices and workshops, a large [[Military logistics|ordnance]] depot, two large hospitals, offices of the medical purveyor of the Department of Alabama, Mississippi, and East Louisiana, and a huge military encampment at the fairgrounds in Webb's Bend.  These brought in thousands of soldiers into town at a time, one that had just over a thousand of its own inhabitants prior to the war, putting an enormous strain on food and accommodations in the town.  Many hundreds of the soldiers who died in the hospitals during the war were buried in a Confederate cemetery on the south end of Webb's Bend, but the site is underwater today, following the damming of the river below Demopolis in the 20th century.<ref name=\"peoplescity7\"/>\n\nAfter the loss of its primary east-west railroad during the war, the Confederate government completed the [[Alabama and Mississippi Rivers Railroad]] from [[Selma, Alabama|Selma]] through Demopolis and on to [[Meridian, Mississippi]] in 1862.  The project had been in the works since the 1850s, but several miles between Demopolis and [[Uniontown, Alabama|Uniontown]] had not been finished when war erupted.  As the war raged in all directions around Demopolis in 1864, the city was subjected to a huge influx of war refugees. Nathan B. Whitfield noted in his journal that those from Mobile had taken every available vacant house and the others were crowded with natives along with their descendants and relatives.<ref name=\"peoplescity7\"/>\n\n[[File:CSS Nashville.jpg|thumb|left|The CSS ''Nashville''.]]\nMarch 1865 saw Demopolis preparing to defend the town against Union threats, with the fortification of key positions.  Three circular [[artillery battery|batteries]], surrounded by earthworks, were constructed and other fortifications built across the southern reaches of town.  With the impending fall of Selma in early April, during [[Wilson's Raid]], all of the railroad's rolling stock was sent full of supplies westward through Demopolis and on to Meridian. A flotilla of eighteen Confederate [[gunboat]]s and [[packet ship]]s were relocated to the Tombigbee River at Demopolis around this same time.  These included the [[CSS Nashville (1864)|CSS ''Nashville'']], [[CSS Morgan|CSS ''Morgan'']], [[CSS Baltic|CSS ''Baltic'']], the ''Southern Republic'', ''Black Diamond'', ''Admiral'', ''Clipper'', ''Farrand'', ''Marengo'' and ''St. Nicholas''.<ref name=\"peoplescity7\"/>\n\nWith the surrender of the last of the Confederates, Demopolis found itself a much different city from what it had been prior to the war.  At the end of May 1865, the townspeople learned that an occupying force of Federal soldiers, the 5th Minnesota Infantry, were en route to occupy the town. Once there, they occupied the former fairgrounds.  Despite the usual unpleasantness associated with the occupation of many defeated Southern towns, two of the Minnesota commanders, Colonel William B. Gere and General [[Lucius Frederick Hubbard]] apparently came to be well-liked by the townspeople.  Despite some bright spots in relations, the Episcopal Church in the South was slow to give up on the notion of the Confederacy, resulting in the military governor of Alabama closing all Episcopal churches in the state, effective on September 20, 1865.  Trinity Episcopal Church in Demopolis was put under Federal guard, and during this time the church mysteriously burned down.  Blame was placed on the soldiers for intentionally burning it, but this has never been born out by the facts.  Aside from all of this, the more pressing matter was the devastated economy of the community and surrounding countryside, a problem that would continue through the [[Reconstruction Era of the United States|Reconstruction era]].<ref name=\"peoplescity8\">Smith, ''The Peoples City'', 219\u2013332.</ref>\n\n[[File:Demopolis Historic Business District 05.JPG|thumb|Demopolis City Hall in 2010. It was built as a courthouse annex in 1869\u201370.]]\nDuring Reconstruction, the new authorities in charge of the government decided to move the [[county seat]] of Marengo from its central location in [[Linden, Alabama|Linden]] to Demopolis by an act approved on December 4, 1868.  The county appointed Richard Jones, Jr., Lewis B. McCarty, and Dr. Bryan W. Whitfield to build or buy a new courthouse in Demopolis.  They negotiated the purchase of the Presbyterian church on the town square, now known as Rooster Hall, for the sum of $3000.  It was conveyed to the county on April 8, 1869.  The county built a fireproof brick building next door to the former church in 1869\u201370 to house the probate and circuit clerk offices.  This building serves as Demopolis City Hall today.  The move of the county seat was highly controversial, and the [[Alabama Legislature]] set April 18, 1870 as the date for a county-wide referendum to decide if [[Dayton, Alabama|Dayton]], Demopolis, or Linden would become the county seat.  Due to the closeness of the vote and voting irregularities, a run-off between Linden and Demopolis was set for May 14, 1870.  Irregularities appeared again and votes from Dayton, mostly in favor of Linden, were rejected by the board of supervisors.  Linden continued an attempt to persuade the state legislature to move the county seat back to their town, with success in February 1871.  The former courthouse buildings reverted from county ownership to Demopolis and remain city property today.<ref name=\"peoplescity9\">Smith, ''The Peoples City'', 268\u2013274.</ref>\n\n===20th century===\n[[File:John Quill at Webb's Landing in Demopolis in 1912.jpg|thumb|The ''John Quill'' at Webb's Landing in Demopolis in 1912.]]\nThe struggle to rebuild the economy of Demopolis and the surrounding region continued into the 20th century. The growing, trading, and [[cotton mill|milling]] of cotton continued to be a major basis of the economy up until the [[World War I]]-era.

Major financial institutions included the Commercial National Bank, City Bank and Trust Company, and [[Robertson Banking Company]].  One of the first large [[department store]]s of note in the area, Mayer Brothers, built its three-story brick building adjacent across from the public square in 1897 and operated for most of the 20th century.

The name, meaning in Greek \"the People's City\" or \"City of the People\" (from [[Ancient Greek]] ''\u03b4\u1fc6\u03bc\u03bf\u03c2'' + ''\u03c0\u03cc\u03bb\u03b9\u03c2''), was chosen to honor the democratic ideals behind the endeavor.  First settled in 1817, it is one of the oldest continuous settlements in Alabama.<ref name=\"bonpartists1\">Blaufarb, Rafe.

Congress granted approval by an act on March 3, 1817 that allowed them to buy four townships in the [[Alabama Territory]] at $2 per acre, with the provision that they cultivate grape vines and olive trees. Following advice obtained from experienced Western pioneers, they determined that Alabama would provide a good climate for cultivating these crops.  By July 14, 1817, a small party of pioneers had settled at [[White Bluff (Demopolis, Alabama)|White Bluff]] on the Tombigbee River, at the present site of Demopolis, founding the [[Vine and Olive Colony]].<ref name=\"vine1\">Smith, Winston. ''Days of Exile: The Story of the Vine and Olive Colony in Alabama'', pages 31\u201343. Tuscaloosa, Alabama: W. B. Drake and Son, 1967.</ref>\n\nMost prominent and wealthiest among the immigrants was [[Charles, comte Lefebvre-Desnouettes|Count Lefebvre Desnouettes]], who had been a cavalry officer with the rank of Lieutenant-General, under [[Napoleon]]. Considered Napoleon's best friend, he had ridden in Napoleon's carriage during his failed invasion of Russia. Other prominent figures among them included Lieutenant-General Baron [[Charles Lallemand|Henri-Dominique Lallemand]], Count [[Bertrand Clausel]], [[Joseph Lakanal]], Simon Chaudron, Pasqual Luciani, Colonel Jean-Jerome Cluis, Jean-Marie Chapron, Colonel Nicholas Raoul, and Frederic Ravesies.  Most of these expatriates had little interest in pioneer life and sold their shares in the colony, remaining in Philadelphia.<ref name=\"vine2\">Smith, ''Days of Exile'', 96\u2013115.</ref> By 1818, the colony consisted of only 69 settlers.<ref name=\"eoa1\">{{Cite web|last= Blaufarb|first= Rafe |url= http://www.encyclopediaofalabama.org/face/Article.jsp?id=h-1539 |title=Vine and Olive Colony |work=Encyclopedia of Alabama|publisher= Auburn University |date= May 19, 2008 |accessdate=October 5, 2010}}</ref>\n\nDue to a variety of adversities, their pioneering efforts were not the great success for which they had hoped. Following a survey in August 1818, they were to find that their new homes did not fall under the territories encompassed by the congressional approval, and the Vine and Olive Colony was soon forced to move. They learned that their actual land grants began less than a mile to the east of their newly cleared land.  After abandoning the settlement of Demopolis, they soon established two other towns, [[Aigleville (Alabama)|Aigleville]] and [[Arcola, Alabama|Arcola]].<ref name=\"vine3\">Smith, ''Days of Exile'', 47\u201353.</ref>\n\n===American settlement===\n[[File:White Bluff at Demopolis in 1903.jpg|thumb|[[White Bluff (Demopolis, Alabama)|White Bluff]] at Demopolis in 1903.]]\nUpon learning of the survey and that the French grants lay elsewhere, American settlers began to quickly purchase the property of the former French settlement with the intent of turning it into a major river port.  A land company was formed in 1819 with the express purpose of purchasing the land and laying off of a town, the White Bluff Association (later renamed the Company of the Town of Demopolis). [[George Strother Gaines]] was named as the company spokesman and he bought the town site atop White Bluff as soon as it offered for sale.  Commissioners for the company were George Strother Gaines, James Childress, Walter Crenshaw, Count Charles Lefebvre Desnouettes, and Dr. Joseph B. Earle.<ref name=\"peoplescity\"/>\n\nThe commissioners were responsible for overseeing the survey of the site, lot sales, and the early operations of the town.  The commissioners laid off the site into streets, blocks, and lots, with a block of roughly two acres divided into eight lots.  The [[Demopolis Town Square]], encompassing one city block, was established in 1819.  The first lots were sold beginning on April 22, 1819. When Count Desnouettes died in 1822, Allen Glover was appointed to replace him.  As other commissioners retired they were succeeded by David E. Moore, William H. Lyon, Thomas McGee, and George N. Stewart.<ref name=\"peoplescity\"/>\n\nThe streets were laid off utilizing a [[grid plan]], using Philadelphia as a model.  The original streets running north-south were named for trees, such as Ash, Cedar, Cherry, and Chestnut. Exceptions were made for Commissioners, Strawberry, and Market (now Main) streets. Several short north-south streets were also named for commissioners, such as Desnouettes, Earle, Glover, Griffin, and McGee.  The east-west streets were named for national and local heroes, as well as commissioners, such as Childress, Fulton, Gaines, Lyon, Monroe, Washington, Franklin, Jefferson, and Jackson.  Most streets were designed to be {{convert|66|ft|m}} wide.  A strip of land that remained public property, for the use of all, was the land adjoining the Tombigbee River from where Riverside Cemetery is today, to the southwest of the city proper, all the way to the Upper Landing in the north, with Arch Street following the route along the top of the cliff.  Only the portion of Arch Street adjacent to the cemetery remains intact.<ref name=\"peoplescity\"/>\n\n[[File:Bluff Hall 01.jpg|thumb|left|[[Bluff Hall]] in 2008]]\nSome flaws and limitations of the original town plan had become apparent by the late 1820s and 1830s. The typical town lots, at {{convert|75|ft|m}} wide and {{convert|150|ft|m}} deep were not conducive to the building of the stately homes desired by the more prosperous citizens of the town, although some grand mansions did begin to appear by the late 1820s.  One of the first was the brick {{frac|2|1|2}}-story [[Federal architecture|Federal]]-style Allen Glover house at the foot of Capitol street.  It was one of the, if not the first neoclassical structure to appear in Marengo County.  It was soon followed by [[Bluff Hall]], built in 1832 by Allen Glover for his daughter, Sarah Serena, and son-in-law, [[Francis Strother Lyon]].<ref name=\"peoplescity\"/>\n\nOne major flaw in the town plan was that there was no clearly defined business district, resulting in commercial and residential buildings mixed together all over town.  This eventually resulted in numerous blighted areas. Some stores did open around the town square, however, and warehouses started to appear adjacent to the town's three major river landings, Upper Landing, above the modern Demopolis Yacht Basin and Marina, Webb's Landing at the western terminus of Washington Street, and Lower Landing to the west of Riverside Cemetery and the Whitfield Canal.<ref name=\"peoplescity\"/><ref name=\"gnis1\">{{Gnis|137596|Demopolis Upper Landing}}</ref><ref name=\"gnis2\">{{Gnis|157225|Webb's Landing}}</ref><ref name=\"gnis3\">{{Gnis|137595|Demopolis Lower Landing (historical)}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Gaineswood by Highsmith 007.jpg|thumb|Nathan B. Whitfield's [[Gaineswood]] in 2010, built from 1843\u201361 on what was then the outskirts of town.]]\nBy the 1830s Demopolis had developed into a regional commercial river hub, attracting American and European-born craftsmen and merchants including the Beysiegle, Breitling, Breton, Dupertuis, Foster, Hummell, Kirker, Knapp, Marx, Michael, Mulligan, Oberling, Rhodes, Rudisill, Rosenbaum, Schmidt, Shahan, Stallings, and Zaiser families. Numerous [[List of plantations in Alabama|plantation]] owners also established townhouses in the community or on its outskirts, including the Allen, Ashe, Curtis, DuBose, Foscue, Glover, Griffin, Lane, Lyon, McAllister, Prout, Reese, Strudwick, [[Tayloe (disambiguation)|Tayloe]], Whitfield, and Vaughan families.  However, unlike many other towns in the Canebrake and Black Belt, Demopolis was never overwhelmed by a homogeneous planter class that came to dominate so many of the others.  During these years and those to come, the rivers brought in a large itinerant population with a desire for raucous entertainment.  This created a profitable and brisk trade for those operating taverns and did much to earn early Demopolis a reputation for decadence.<ref name=\"peoplescity\"/>\n\nDuring the 1840s many of the streets laid out by the town fathers had yet to be opened to traffic.  The town council focused much of its attention on clearing the intended streets of obstacles and opening them to traffic, other street improvements, and the building of wooden sidewalks along major thoroughfares. The council also approved measures for protecting trees in the common areas and streets. Several town ordinances were enacted in 1842 to further restrain the [[History of slavery in Alabama|enslaved]] African American population.  These included the prohibition of selling or purchasing any article or commodity from or to a slave without written permission from their master or overseer, no slave was allowed to purchase alcohol without written consent, if any slave were convicted of assault upon \"any white man, [[negro]], or [[mulatto]]\" the owner would be fined $50, any slave caught running \"any horse, [[gelding]], or [[mule]]\" through town would be subject to fifteen [[flagellation|lashes]] unless the owner pays a fine of $1, any slave caught driving any wagon or cart or driving a horse or mule on or across the sidewalks of the town would be subject to 10 lashes unless the owner pays a fine of 50 cents.<ref name=\"peoplescity\"/>\n\n[[File:Trinity Episcopal Demopolis 02.JPG|thumb|left|Trinity Episcopal Church, this structure was built in 1870 after the previous building burned in 1865 during the occupation of the city by Federal troops.]]\nWith its eclectic mix of citizenry, Demopolis was slow to erect houses of worship.  In fact, a group of [[United Methodist Church|Methodist]] ministers convened nearby in 1843 pronounced Demopolis as \"wholly irreligious.\"  Mainline Protestant churches were slow to take root, in fact, no churches at all were built in Demopolis until 1840.  Prior to that time, various denominational groups met in a log assembly house on the town square until it was torn down in 1844.  A [[Baptist]] group had been established in the 1820s but ended due to a lack of support.  The [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopalians]] established a congregation in 1834, but did not build their Trinity Episcopal Church until 1850.  A [[Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.)|Presbyterian]] congregation was established in 1839 and completed their first church, a brick structure now known as Rooster Hall, on the town square in 1843.  The Methodist congregation was established in 1840 and the first building was completed in 1843.<ref name=\"peoplescity2\">Smith, ''The Peoples City''</ref>{{rp|6\u20138}}  Present in Demopolis from the beginning, the Catholic congregation in town was listed as a mission of Saint John the Baptist in [[Tuscaloosa, Alabama|Tuscaloosa]] in 1851. It was switched to [[Selma, Alabama|Selma]] in 1880. They met in a small frame church and private homes until the current Saint Leo the Great was built in 1905.  The Jewish congregation, [[Temple B'nai Jeshurun (Demopolis, Alabama)|B'nai Jeshurun]], was established in 1858, although the community had been present since the 1840s. B'nai Jeshurun was the fourth Jewish congregation established in Alabama.<ref name=\"MSJEOVER\">{{cite web |url=http://www.isjl.org/history/archive/main_al.htm |title=Alabama |work=Encyclopedia of Southern Jewish Communities  |publisher=Goldring / Woldenberg Institute of Southern Jewish Life |accessdate=October 5, 2010}}</ref>  They initially met in homes and businesses until eventually building a [[Moorish Revival architecture|Moorish Revival]]-style temple in 1893.<ref name=\"peoplescity2\"/>{{rp|6\u20138}}<ref>Marengo County Heritage Book Committee: ''The heritage of Marengo County, Alabama'', pages 34\u201346.

These included the ''Forest Monarch'', ''Alice Vivian'', and the ill-fated ''[[Eliza Battle]]''.  Several others were dedicated to almost exclusively to Demopolis and the cotton trade, including the ''Allen Glover'', ''Canebrake'', ''Cherokee'', ''Demopolis'', ''Frank Lyon'', ''Marengo'', and the ''Mollie Glover''.  Major hotels during this same period included the Planter's Hotel, later known as Madison House Hotel, and the River Hotel.<ref name=\"peoplescity5\">Smith, ''The Peoples City'', 16\u201319</ref>\n\nThe year 1853 saw a [[yellow fever]] epidemic strike the city, with some interments in an ill-defined two-acre cemetery to the north of town in the river bend.  The Jewish Cemetery was established in 1878 to the east of town on Jefferson Street.  The [[Glover Mausoleum]] was completed on the banks of the Tombigbee in 1845, with the burial of many family members in and around it. This led to the establishment of the main burial ground for the city, Riverside Cemetery, officially opened with the sale of additional plots to the public in 1882.<ref name=\"peoplescity\"/>  A circular [[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothic Revival]]-style [[amphitheater]], complete with a [[battlement|crenelated]] roof-line, was completed in 1859 north of town in Webb's Bend at the fairgrounds.  The fairgrounds and its buildings covered approximately {{convert|20|acre}} and hosted a variety of events until the outbreak of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].<ref name=\"peoplescity6\">Smith, ''The Peoples City'', 73\u201374.</ref>\n\nBy 1860, the population within the town limits had grown to approximately 1,200 people.<ref name=\"peoplescity2\"/>{{rp|339}}  The wealthiest citizens were, in order from the highest real and property values, Gaius Whitfield, Goodman G.

These feelings ran high in the county's largest town also.  Prominent secessionists included Nathan B. Whitfield, Francis S. Lyon, Goodman G. Griffin, Kimbrough C. DuBose, George B. Lyon, Dr. James D. Browder, and George E. Markham.  However, many other powerful men in town had opposed secession, including Benjamin Glover Shields, William H. Lyon, Jr., William B. Jones, Pearson J. Glover, Gaius Whitfield, Alfred Hatch, Joel C. DuBose, Robert V. Montague, and [[Henry Augustine Tayloe]].  In the end, however, most men on both sides of the argument joined in the Confederate cause once secession was inevitable.<ref name=\"peoplescity7\">Smith, ''The Peoples City'', 129\u2013218.</ref>\n\n[[File:Rooster Hall.JPG|thumb|Rooster Hall in 2010, it was built in 1843 as the Presbyterian church and then served as the county courthouse from 1868\u201371.]]\nWith the start of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], several Confederate companies drew heavily from the population of the Demopolis area and Marengo County.  These included the 4th, 11th, 21st, 23rd, and 43rd Alabama Infantry Regiments in addition to the 8th Alabama Cavalry, Company E of the Jeff Davis Legion, and Selden's Battery.  During the course of the war, more of these men would be lost to exhaustion, disease, and malnutrition than to battle.  The city itself, on two navigable rivers and a railroad, became home to a number of Confederate installations and offices.  These included [[commissary]] and [[quartermaster]] offices and warehouses, engineers' offices and workshops, a large [[Military logistics|ordnance]] depot, two large hospitals, offices of the medical purveyor of the Department of Alabama, Mississippi, and East Louisiana, and a huge military encampment at the fairgrounds in Webb's Bend.  These brought in thousands of soldiers into town at a time, one that had just over a thousand of its own inhabitants prior to the war, putting an enormous strain on food and accommodations in the town.  Many hundreds of the soldiers who died in the hospitals during the war were buried in a Confederate cemetery on the south end of Webb's Bend, but the site is underwater today, following the damming of the river below Demopolis in the 20th century.<ref name=\"peoplescity7\"/>\n\nAfter the loss of its primary east-west railroad during the war, the Confederate government completed the [[Alabama and Mississippi Rivers Railroad]] from [[Selma, Alabama|Selma]] through Demopolis and on to [[Meridian, Mississippi]] in 1862.  The project had been in the works since the 1850s, but several miles between Demopolis and [[Uniontown, Alabama|Uniontown]] had not been finished when war erupted.  As the war raged in all directions around Demopolis in 1864, the city was subjected to a huge influx of war refugees. Nathan B. Whitfield noted in his journal that those from Mobile had taken every available vacant house and the others were crowded with natives along with their descendants and relatives.<ref name=\"peoplescity7\"/>\n\n[[File:CSS Nashville.jpg|thumb|left|The CSS ''Nashville''.]]\nMarch 1865 saw Demopolis preparing to defend the town against Union threats, with the fortification of key positions.  Three circular [[artillery battery|batteries]], surrounded by earthworks, were constructed and other fortifications built across the southern reaches of town.  With the impending fall of Selma in early April, during [[Wilson's Raid]], all of the railroad's rolling stock was sent full of supplies westward through Demopolis and on to Meridian. A flotilla of eighteen Confederate [[gunboat]]s and [[packet ship]]s were relocated to the Tombigbee River at Demopolis around this same time.  These included the [[CSS Nashville (1864)|CSS ''Nashville'']], [[CSS Morgan|CSS ''Morgan'']], [[CSS Baltic|CSS ''Baltic'']], the ''Southern Republic'', ''Black Diamond'', ''Admiral'', ''Clipper'', ''Farrand'', ''Marengo'' and ''St. Nicholas''.<ref name=\"peoplescity7\"/>\n\nWith the surrender of the last of the Confederates, Demopolis found itself a much different city from what it had been prior to the war.  At the end of May 1865, the townspeople learned that an occupying force of Federal soldiers, the 5th Minnesota Infantry, were en route to occupy the town. Once there, they occupied the former fairgrounds.  Despite the usual unpleasantness associated with the occupation of many defeated Southern towns, two of the Minnesota commanders, Colonel William B. Gere and General [[Lucius Frederick Hubbard]] apparently came to be well-liked by the townspeople.  Despite some bright spots in relations, the Episcopal Church in the South was slow to give up on the notion of the Confederacy, resulting in the military governor of Alabama closing all Episcopal churches in the state, effective on September 20, 1865.  Trinity Episcopal Church in Demopolis was put under Federal guard, and during this time the church mysteriously burned down.  Blame was placed on the soldiers for intentionally burning it, but this has never been born out by the facts.  Aside from all of this, the more pressing matter was the devastated economy of the community and surrounding countryside, a problem that would continue through the [[Reconstruction Era of the United States|Reconstruction era]].<ref name=\"peoplescity8\">Smith, ''The Peoples City'', 219\u2013332.</ref>\n\n[[File:Demopolis Historic Business District 05.JPG|thumb|Demopolis City Hall in 2010. It was built as a courthouse annex in 1869\u201370.]]\nDuring Reconstruction, the new authorities in charge of the government decided to move the [[county seat]] of Marengo from its central location in [[Linden, Alabama|Linden]] to Demopolis by an act approved on December 4, 1868.  The county appointed Richard Jones, Jr., Lewis B. McCarty, and Dr. Bryan W. Whitfield to build or buy a new courthouse in Demopolis.  They negotiated the purchase of the Presbyterian church on the town square, now known as Rooster Hall, for the sum of $3000.  It was conveyed to the county on April 8, 1869.  The county built a fireproof brick building next door to the former church in 1869\u201370 to house the probate and circuit clerk offices.  This building serves as Demopolis City Hall today.  The move of the county seat was highly controversial, and the [[Alabama Legislature]] set April 18, 1870 as the date for a county-wide referendum to decide if [[Dayton, Alabama|Dayton]], Demopolis, or Linden would become the county seat.  Due to the closeness of the vote and voting irregularities, a run-off between Linden and Demopolis was set for May 14, 1870.  Irregularities appeared again and votes from Dayton, mostly in favor of Linden, were rejected by the board of supervisors.  Linden continued an attempt to persuade the state legislature to move the county seat back to their town, with success in February 1871.  The former courthouse buildings reverted from county ownership to Demopolis and remain city property today.<ref name=\"peoplescity9\">Smith, ''The Peoples City'', 268\u2013274.</ref>\n\n===20th century===\n[[File:John Quill at Webb's Landing in Demopolis in 1912.jpg|thumb|The ''John Quill'' at Webb's Landing in Demopolis in 1912.]]\nThe struggle to rebuild the economy of Demopolis and the surrounding region continued into the 20th century.
