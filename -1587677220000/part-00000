The various duties included manually pumping oil and fuel, checking tire wear, observing gauges, and even massaging the driver's hands.<ref>{{cite episode|series=The Talk of Gasoline Alley|serieslink=Donald Davidson (historian)|station=[[WFNI]]|airdate=May 5, 2010}}</ref> They also communicated with the pits and [[Spotter (auto racing)|spotted]] from inside the car.<ref name=IndyStar /> If the car ran out of fuel, or otherwise broke down, the riding mechanic was usually responsible for running back to the pits to fetch fuel or the necessary spare parts.\n\nRiding mechanics were also referred to by the term '''mechanician'''.

In the [[1911 Indianapolis 500|first 500]], driver [[Ray Harroun]] notably drove solo, the only car in the field without a riding mechanic. He famously affixed a [[rear-view mirror]] to the car, in order to see cars behind him (a task normally assigned to the mechanic).

It is an important example of a [[Romance (heroic literature)|chivalric romance]], which typically involves a hero who goes on a quest which tests his prowess. It remains popular in modern English renderings from [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], [[Simon Armitage]] and others, as well as through film and stage adaptations.\n\nIt describes how Sir [[Gawain]], a knight of [[King Arthur]]'s [[Round Table]], accepts a challenge from a mysterious \"[[Green Knight]]\" who dares any knight to strike him with his axe if he will take a return blow in a [[Year and a day rule|year and a day]]. Gawain accepts and beheads him with his blow, at which the Green Knight stands up, picks up his head and reminds Gawain of the appointed time. In his struggles to keep his bargain, Gawain demonstrates [[chivalry]] and [[loyalty]] until his honour is called into question by a test involving [[Lady Bertilak]], the lady of the Green Knight's castle.\n\nThe poem survives in one manuscript, ''Cotton Nero A.x.'', which also includes three religious [[narrative poetry|narrative poems]]: ''[[Pearl (poem)|Pearl]]'', ''[[Cleanness (poem)|Purity]]'' and ''[[Patience (poem)|Patience]]''.

A gigantic figure, entirely green in appearance and riding a green horse, rides unexpectedly into the hall. He wears no armour but bears an axe in one hand and a holly bough in the other. Refusing to fight anyone there on the grounds that they are all too weak to take him on, he insists he has come for a friendly [[christmas game]]: someone is to strike him once with his axe on the condition that the Green Knight may return the blow in a year and a day.<ref>First found in English c.1400, a phrase 'specified in certain legal matters in order to ensure the completion of a full year': comparable terms date from slightly earlier in Middle Dutch, Middle Low German and Anglo-Norman. From :\"year, n.\" OED Online. Oxford University Press, March 2017. Web. 15 March 2017.</ref> The splendid axe will belong to whoever accepts this deal. Arthur himself is prepared to accept the challenge when it appears no other knight will dare, but Sir Gawain, youngest of Arthur's knights and his nephew, asks for the honour instead. The giant bends and bares his neck before him and Gawain neatly beheads him in one stroke. However, the Green Knight neither falls nor falters, but instead reaches out, picks up his severed head and remounts, holding up his bleeding head to Queen [[Guinevere]] while its writhing lips remind Gawain that the two must meet again at the [[Green Chapel]]. He then rides away. Gawain and Arthur admire the axe, hang it up as a trophy and encourage Guinevere to treat the whole matter lightly.\n\nAs the date approaches, Sir Gawain sets off to find the Green Chapel and keep his side of the bargain. Many adventures and battles are alluded to (but not described) until Gawain comes across a splendid castle where he meets Bertilak de Hautdesert, the lord of the castle, and his beautiful wife, who are pleased to have such a renowned guest. Also present is an old and ugly lady, unnamed but treated with great honour by all. Gawain tells them of his New Year's appointment at the Green Chapel and that he only has a few days remaining. Bertilak laughs, explaining that there is a path that will take him to there less than two miles away, and proposes that Gawain rest at the castle until then. Relieved and grateful, Gawain agrees.\n\nBefore going hunting the next day, Bertilak proposes a bargain: he will give Gawain whatever he catches on the condition that Gawain give him whatever he might gain during the day. Gawain accepts. After Bertilak leaves, [[Lady Bertilak]] visits Gawain's bedroom and behaves seductively, but despite her best efforts he yields nothing but a single kiss in his unwillingness to offend her. When Bertilak returns and gives Gawain the deer he has killed, his guest gives a kiss to Bertilak without divulging its source. The next day the lady comes again, Gawain again courteously foils her advances, and later that day there is a similar exchange of a hunted [[boar]] for two kisses. She comes once more on the third morning, but once her advances are denied, she offers Gawain a gold ring as a keepsake. He gently but steadfastly refuses but she pleads that he at least take her belt, a girdle of green and gold silk. The belt, the lady assures him, is charmed and will keep him from all physical harm. Tempted, as he may otherwise die the next day, Gawain accepts it, and they exchange three kisses. The lady has Gawain swear that he will keep the gift secret from Bertilak. That evening, Bertilak returns with a fox, which he exchanges with Gawain for the three kisses \u2013 but Gawain says nothing of the girdle.\n\nThe next day, Gawain binds the belt twice around his waist. He finds the Green Knight sharpening an axe and, as promised, Gawain bends his bared neck to receive his blow. At the first swing, Gawain flinches slightly and the Green Knight belittles him for it. Ashamed of himself, Gawain doesn't flinch with the second swing; but again the Green Knight withholds the full force of his blow. The knight explains he was testing Gawain's nerve. Angrily Gawain tells him to deliver his blow and so the knight does, causing only a slight wound on Gawain's neck. The game is over. Gawain seizes his sword, helmet and shield, but the Green Knight, laughing, reveals himself to be the lord of the castle, Bertilak de Hautdesert, transformed by magic. He explains that the entire adventure was a trick of the \"elderly lady\" Gawain saw at the castle, who is actually the sorceress [[Morgan le Fay]], Arthur's sister, who intended to test Arthur's knights and frighten Guinevere to death.<ref>{{cite book|title=Masters of British Literature Volume A|year=2008|publisher=Pearson Longman|isbn=9780321333995|pages=[https://archive.org/details/mastersofbritish0000unse/page/200 200\u2013201]|url=https://archive.org/details/mastersofbritish0000unse/page/200}}</ref> Gawain is ashamed to have behaved deceitfully but the Green Knight laughs and professes him the most blameless knight in all the land. The two part on cordial terms. Gawain returns to Camelot wearing the girdle as a token of his failure to keep his promise. The [[Knights of the Round Table]] absolve him of blame and decide that henceforth each will wear a green [[sash]] in recognition of Gawain's adventure and as a reminder to be always honest.\n\n==\"Gawain Poet\"==\n{{Main|Gawain Poet}}  \nThough the real name of \"The ''Gawain'' Poet\" (or poets) is unknown, some inferences about him can be drawn from an informed reading of his works. The manuscript of ''Gawain'' is known in academic circles as ''Cotton Nero A.x.'', following a naming system used by one of its owners, [[Robert Bruce Cotton|Robert Cotton]], a collector of Medieval English texts.<ref name=\"ucalgary\"/> Before the ''Gawain'' manuscript came into Cotton's possession, it was in the library of Henry Savile in [[Yorkshire]].<ref>{{cite web| title = Pearl: Introduction| publisher = Medieval Institute Publications, Inc.| year = 2001| url = http://www.lib.rochester.edu/camelot/teams/pearlint.htm| accessdate = 2007-04-02}}</ref> Little is known about its previous ownership, and until 1824, when the manuscript was introduced to the academic community in a second edition of [[Thomas Warton]]'s ''History'' edited by [[Richard Price (British historian)|Richard Price]], it was almost entirely unknown. Even then, the ''Gawain'' poem was not published in its entirety until 1839.<ref>Turville-Petre, Thorlac. The Alliterative Revival.

However, the manuscript containing these poems was transcribed by a copyist and not by the original poet. Although nothing explicitly suggests that all four poems are by the same poet, comparative analysis of dialect, verse form, and diction have pointed towards single authorship.<ref name = poet>Nelles, William. \"The Pearl-Poet\". ''Cyclopedia of World Authors'', Fourth Revised Edition Database: MagillOnLiterature Plus, 1958.</ref>\n\nWhat is known today about the poet is largely general. As [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] and [[E. V. Gordon]], after reviewing the text's allusions, style, and themes, concluded in 1925:\n{{quote|He was a man of serious and devout mind, though not without humour; he had an interest in theology, and some knowledge of it, though an amateur knowledge perhaps, rather than a professional; he had Latin and French and was well enough read in French books, both romantic and instructive; but his home was in the West Midlands of England; so much his language shows, and his metre, and his scenery.<ref name = Tolkien/>}}\n\nThe most commonly suggested candidate for authorship is [[John Massey (poet)|John Massey]] of Cotton, Cheshire.<ref>{{cite journal| last1 = Peterson| first1 = Clifford J| year = 1974| title = The Pearl-Poet and John Massey of Cotton, Cheshire| url =| journal = The Review of English Studies |series=New Series| volume = 25| issue = 99| pages = 257\u2013266| doi=10.1093/res/xxv.99.257}}</ref> He is known to have lived in the dialect region of the Gawain Poet and is thought to have written the poem ''[[St. Erkenwald (poem)|St. Erkenwald]]'', which some scholars argue bears stylistic similarities to ''Gawain''. ''St. Erkenwald'', however, has been dated by some scholars to a time outside the Gawain Poet's era. Thus, ascribing authorship to John Massey is still controversial and most critics consider the Gawain Poet an unknown.<ref name = poet/>\n\n==Verse form==\nThe 2,530 lines and 101 [[stanzas]] that make up ''Sir Gawain and the Green Knight'' are written in what linguists call the \"[[Alliterative Revival]]\" style typical of the 14th century. Instead of focusing on a [[Meter (poetry)|metrical]] syllabic count and [[rhyme]], the [[Alliterative verse|alliterative form]] of this period usually relied on the agreement of a pair of stressed syllables at the beginning of the line and another pair at the end. Each line always includes a pause, called a ''[[caesura]]'', at some point after the first two stresses, dividing it into two half-lines. Although he largely follows the form of his day, the Gawain poet was somewhat freer with convention than his or her predecessors. The poet broke the alliterative lines into variable-length groups and ended these nominal stanzas with a rhyming section of five lines known as the ''[[bob and wheel]]'', in which the \"bob\" is a very short line, sometimes of only two syllables, followed by the \"wheel,\" longer lines with [[internal rhyme]].<ref name = norton />\n\n{{Clear}}\n<center>\n{| border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\"\n|+\n!

This story parallels ''Gawain'' in that, like the Green Knight, [[C\u00fa Chulainn]]'s antagonist feints three blows with the axe before letting his target depart without injury. A beheading exchange also appears in the late 12th-century ''[[Caradoc|Life of Caradoc]]'', a [[Middle French]] narrative embedded in the anonymous [[Perceval, the Story of the Grail#First Continuation|First Continuation]] of [[Chr\u00e9tien de Troyes]]' ''[[Perceval, the Story of the Grail]]''. A notable difference in this story is that Caradoc's challenger is his father in disguise, come to test his honour. [[Lancelot]] is given a beheading challenge in the early 13th-century ''[[Perlesvaus]]'', in which a knight begs him to chop off his head or else put his own in jeopardy. Lancelot reluctantly cuts it off, agreeing to come to the same place in a year to put his head in the same danger. When Lancelot arrives, the people of the town celebrate and announce that they have finally found a true knight, because many others had failed this test of chivalry.<ref name = Brewer/>\n\nThe stories ''The Girl with the Mule'' (alternately titled ''The Mule Without a Bridle'') and ''Hunbaut'' feature Gawain in beheading game situations. In ''Hunbaut,'' Gawain cuts off a man's head and, before he can replace it, removes the magic cloak keeping the man alive, thus killing him. Several stories tell of knights who struggle to stave off the advances of women sent by their lords as a test; these stories include ''Yder'', the [[Lancelot-Grail]], ''Hunbaut'', and ''The Knight of the Sword''. The last two involve Gawain specifically. Usually the temptress is the daughter or wife of a lord to whom the knight owes respect, and the knight is tested to see whether or not he will remain [[chaste]] in trying circumstances.<ref name = Brewer>Brewer, Elisabeth.

Despite having his appearance changed to resemble Arawn exactly, Pwyll does not have sexual relations with Arawn's wife during this time, thus establishing a lasting friendship between the two men. This story may, then, provide a background to Gawain's attempts to resist the wife of the Green Knight; thus, the story of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight may be seen as a tale which combines elements of the Celtic beheading game and seduction test stories. Additionally, in both stories a year passes before the completion of the conclusion of the challenge or exchange. Some scholars disagree with this interpretation, however, as Arawn seems to have accepted the notion that Pwyll may reciprocate with his wife, making it less of a \"seduction test\" per se, as seduction tests typically involve a Lord and Lady conspiring to seduce a knight, seemingly ''against'' the wishes of the Lord.<ref name =friedman>Friedman, Albert B. \"Morgan le Fay in Sir Gawain and the Green Knight.\" ''Speculum.''

The Turk then praises Gawain and showers him with gifts. ''[[The Carle of Carlisle]]'' (17th century) also resembles ''Gawain'' in a scene in which the Carle (Churl), a lord, takes Sir Gawain to a chamber where two swords are hanging and orders Gawain to cut off his head or suffer his own to be cut off.<ref>Hahn, Thomas. \"The Carle of Carlisle\", in ''Sir Gawain: Eleven Romances and Tales''.

(''God Speed!'' \u2013 [[Edmund Blair Leighton#List of works|Edmund Blair Leighton]] 1900)]]\nAt the heart of ''Sir Gawain and the Green Knight'' is the test of Gawain's adherence to the code of [[chivalry]]. The typical [[temptation]] [[fable]] of [[medieval literature]] presents a series of tribulations assembled as tests or \"proofs\" of moral [[virtue]]. The stories often describe several individuals' failures after which the main character is tested.<ref name=\"kittsix\">Kittredge, George Lyman. ''A Study of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight''. Harvard University Press, 1960. p.&nbsp;76. ASIN B0006AWBXS</ref> Success in the proofs will often bring immunity or good fortune. Gawain's ability to pass the tests of his host are of utmost importance to his survival, though he does not know it. It is only by fortuity or \"instinctive-courtesy\" that Sir Gawain is able to pass his test.<ref name=\"kitteight\">Kittredge, p.&nbsp;83</ref> Gawain does not realize, however, that these tests are all orchestrated by Sir Bertilak.<ref>\"Sir Gawain and the Green Knight\". ''Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, Pearl, Sir Orfeo''. Translated by J.\u00a0R.\u00a0R. Tolkien, New York: Ballantine Books, 1975. 92.</ref>\nIn addition to the laws of chivalry, Gawain must respect another set of laws concerning [[courtly love]]. The [[knight]]'s code of honour requires him to do whatever a [[wikt:damsel|damsel]] asks. Gawain must accept the girdle from the Lady, but he must also keep the promise he has made to his host that he will give whatever he gains that day. Gawain chooses to keep the girdle out of fear of death, thus breaking his promise to the host but honouring the lady. Upon learning that the Green Knight is actually his host (Bertilak), he realises that although he has completed his quest, he has failed to be virtuous. This test demonstrates the conflict between honour and knightly duties. In breaking his promise, Gawain believes he has lost his honour and failed in his duties.<ref>Burrow, J.\u00a0A. ''A Reading of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight''. London: Kegan Paul Ltd., 1965. p.&nbsp;162. {{ISBN|0-7100-8695-4}}</ref>\n\n===Hunting and seduction===\nScholars have frequently noted the parallels between the three hunting scenes and the three seduction scenes in ''Gawain''. They are generally agreed that the fox chase has significant parallels to the third seduction scene, in which Gawain accepts the girdle from Bertilak's wife. Gawain, like the fox, fears for his life and is looking for a way to avoid death from the Green Knight's axe. Like his counterpart, he resorts to trickery in order to save his skin. The fox uses tactics so unlike the first two animals, and so unexpectedly, that Bertilak has the hardest time hunting it. Similarly, Gawain finds the Lady's advances in the third seduction scene more unpredictable and challenging to resist than her previous attempts. She changes her evasive language, typical of [[courtly love]] relationships, to a more assertive style. Her dress, relatively modest in earlier scenes, is suddenly voluptuous and revealing.<ref name = Burnley>{{cite journal| last1 = Burnley| first1 = J.\u00a0D.| year = 1973| title = The Hunting Scenes in 'Sir Gawain and the Green Knight' \".| url =| journal = The Yearbook of English Studies| volume = 3| issue =| pages = 1\u20139| doi=10.2307/3506850| jstor = 3506850}}</ref>\n\nThe deer- and boar-hunting scenes are less clearly connected, although scholars have attempted to link each animal to Gawain's reactions in the parallel seduction scene. Attempts to connect the deer hunt with the first seduction scene have unearthed a few parallels. Deer hunts of the time, like courtship, had to be done according to established rules. Women often favoured suitors who hunted well and skinned their animals, sometimes even watching while a deer was cleaned.<ref name = Burnley/><ref>The \"hyndez\" (hinds) first described in the poem are probably from [[red deer]], a species with large antlers like the [[elk|American elk]], while the subsequent \"dos and of o\u00feer dere\" (does and other deer) likely refer to the smaller [[fallow deer]]. (Ong, Walter J. \"The Green Knight's Harts and Bucks\". ''Modern Language Notes''. (December 1950) 65.8 pp.&nbsp;536\u2013539.)</ref> The sequence describing the deer hunt is relatively unspecific and nonviolent, with an air of relaxation and exhilaration. The first seduction scene follows in a similar vein, with no overt physical advances and no apparent danger; the entire exchange is humorously portrayed.<ref name = Burnley/>\n\nThe boar-hunting scene is, in contrast, laden with detail. Boars were (and are) much more difficult to hunt than deer; approaching one with only a sword was akin to challenging a knight to single combat. In the hunting sequence, the boar flees but is cornered before a ravine. He turns to face Bertilak with his back to the ravine, prepared to fight. Bertilak dismounts and in the ensuing fight kills the boar. He removes its head and displays it on a pike. In the seduction scene, Bertilak's wife, like the boar, is more forward, insisting that Gawain has a romantic reputation and that he must not disappoint her. Gawain, however, is successful in parrying her attacks, saying that surely she knows more than he about love. Both the boar hunt and the seduction scene can be seen as depictions of a moral victory: both Gawain and Bertilak face struggles alone and emerge triumphant.<ref name = Burnley/>\nMasculinity has also been associated with hunting. The theme of masculinity is present throughout. In an article by Vern L. Bullough, \"Being a Male in the Middle Ages,\" he discusses Sir Gawain and how normally, masculinity is often viewed in terms of being sexually active. He notes that Sir Gawain is not part of this normalcy.\n\n===Nature and chivalry===\nSome argue that nature represents a chaotic, lawless order which is in direct confrontation with the civilisation of Camelot throughout ''Sir Gawain and the Green Knight''. The green horse and rider that first invade Arthur's peaceful halls are iconic representations of nature's disturbance.<ref>Cawley, A. C. 'Pearl, Sir Gawain and the Green Knight':\"...the Green Knight, ''alias'' Sir Bertilak, is an immensely vital person who is closely associated with the life of nature: his greenness, the birds and flies of his decorative embroidery, his beard as great as a bush, the holly branch in his hand, the energy he displays as a huntsman-all give him kinship with the physical world outside the castle.\"</ref> Nature is presented throughout the poem as rough and indifferent, constantly threatening the order of men and courtly life. Nature invades and disrupts order in the major events of the narrative, both symbolically and through the inner nature of humanity. This element appears first with the disruption caused by the Green Knight, later when Gawain must fight off his natural lust for Bertilak's wife, and again when Gawain breaks his vow to Bertilak by choosing to keep the green girdle, valuing survival over virtue. Represented by the [[sin]]-stained girdle, [[nature]] is an underlying force, forever within man and keeping him imperfect (in a chivalric sense).<ref name = woodsw>Woods, William F. \"Nature and the Inner Man in Sir Gawain and the Green Knight\". ''The Chaucer Review'', Vol. 36, No. 3, 2002, pp.&nbsp;209\u2013227.</ref> In this view, Gawain is part of a wider conflict between nature and chivalry, an examination of the ability of man's order to overcome the chaos of nature.<ref name = rhg>Green, Richard Hamilton. \"Gawain's Shield and the Quest for Perfection\". ''ELH''. (June 1962) 29.2 pp.&nbsp;121\u2013139.</ref>\n\nSeveral critics have made exactly the opposite interpretation, reading the poem as a comic critique of the Christianity of the time, particularly as embodied in the Christian chivalry of Arthur's court. In its zeal to extirpate all traces of paganism, Christianity had cut itself off from the sources of life in nature and the female. The green girdle represents all the pentangle lacks. The Arthurian enterprise is doomed unless it can acknowledge the unattainability of the ideals of the Round Table, and, for the sake of realism and wholeness, recognize and incorporate the pagan values represented by the Green Knight.<ref>This interpretation was first advanced by John Speirs in ''Scrutiny'', vol.\u00a0XVI, iv, 1949 (incorporated in his ''Medieval English Poetry: The Non-Chaucerian Tradition'', rev.\u00a0ed. 1962. Similar interpretations were later offered by Francis Berry in ''The Pelican Guide to English Literature: The Age of Chaucer'', 1954; Goldhurst, \"The Green and the Gold: The Major Theme of ''Sit Gawain and the Green Knight'', ''College English'', Nov. 1958; A.C, Spearing, ''The Gawain-Poet: A Critical Study'', 1970; W. A. Davenport, ''The Art of the Gawain-Poet'', 1978; J. Tambling, \"A More Powerful Life: ''Sir Gawain and the Green Knight''\", ''Haltwhistle Quarterly'' 9, 1981; and K. Sagar, \"Sir Gawain and the Green Girdle\", in his ''Literature and the Crime Against Nature'', 2005.</ref>\n\nThe chivalry that is represented within 'Gawain' is one which was constructed by court nobility. The violence that is part of this chivalry is steeply contrasted by the fact that King Arthur's court is Christian and the initial beheading event takes place while celebrating Christmas. The violence of an act of beheading seems to be counterintuitive to chivalric and Christian ideals, and yet it is seen as part of knighthood.<ref>{{cite journal| last1 = Martin| first1 = Carl Grey| year = 2009| title = The Cipher of Chivalry: Violence as Courtly Play in the World of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight| url =| journal = The Chaucer Review| volume = 43| issue = 3| pages = 311\u201329| jstor=25642113}}</ref>\n\nThe question of politeness and chivalry is a main theme during Gawain's interactions with Bertilak's wife. He cannot accept her advances or else lose his honour, and yet he cannot utterly refuse her advances or else risk upsetting his hostess. Gawain plays a very fine line and the only part where he appears to fail is when he conceals the green girdle from Bertilak.<ref>{{cite journal| last1 = Jucker| first1 = Andreas H.| year = 2015| title = Courtesy and Politness in Sir Gawain and the Green Knight| url =| journal = Studia Anglica Posnaniensia| volume = 43| issue = 3| pages = 5\u201328| doi=10.1515/stap-2015-0007| doi-access = free}}</ref>\n\n===Games===\nThe word ''gomen'' (game) is found 18 times in ''Gawain''. Its similarity to the word ''gome'' (man), which appears 21 times, has led some scholars to see men and games as centrally linked. Games at this time were seen as tests of worthiness, as when the Green Knight challenges the court's right to its good name in a \"Christmas game\".<ref name = game /> The \"game\" of exchanging gifts was common in Germanic cultures. If a man received a gift, he was obliged to provide the giver with a better gift or risk losing his honour, almost like an exchange of blows in a fight (or in a \"beheading game\").<ref>{{cite journal| last1 = Harwood| first1 = Britton J| year = 1991| title = Gawain and the Gift| url =| journal = PMLA| volume = 106| issue = 3| pages = 483\u201399| doi=10.2307/462781| jstor = 462781}}</ref> The poem revolves around two games: an exchange of beheading and an exchange of winnings. These appear at first to be unconnected. However, a victory in the first game will lead to a victory in the second. Elements of both games appear in other stories; however, the linkage of outcomes is unique to ''Gawain''.<ref name = norton /><ref name = Tolkien>''Sir Gawain and the Green Knight'', Edited J.\u00a0R.\u00a0R. Tolkien and E.\u00a0V. Gordon, revised Norman Davis, 1925. introduction, xv. ASIN B000IPU84U</ref>\n\n===Times and seasons===\nTimes, dates, seasons, and cycles within ''Gawain'' are often noted by scholars because of their symbolic nature. The story starts on New Year's Eve with a beheading and culminates on the next New Year's Day. Gawain leaves Camelot on [[All Saints Day]] and arrives at Bertilak's castle on Christmas Eve. Furthermore, the Green Knight tells Gawain to meet him at the Green Chapel in \"a year and a day\"\u2014a period of time seen often in medieval literature.<ref name = year>For reasons not entirely understood, the Celts used the phrase \"a year and a day\", to refer to exactly one year. See for example W. J. McGee's \"The Beginning of Mathematics.\" ''American Anthropologist.'' (Oct 1899) Vol. 1 Iss. 4 pp.&nbsp;646\u2013674.</ref> Some scholars interpret the yearly cycles, each beginning and ending in winter, as the poet's attempt to convey the inevitable fall of all things good and noble in the world. Such a theme is strengthened by the image of [[Trojan War|Troy]], a powerful nation once thought to be invincible which, according to the ''[[Aeneid]]'', fell to the Greeks due to pride and ignorance. The Trojan connection shows itself in the presence of two virtually identical descriptions of Troy's destruction. The poem's first line reads: \"Since the siege and the assault were ceased at Troy\" and the final stanzaic line (before the bob and wheel) is \"After the siege and the assault were ceased at Troy\".<ref name = christian>{{cite journal| last1 = Clark| first1 = S.

He participates in the beheading contest, watches as a man he has beheaded walks away unscathed, prepares for a journey where he will then also receive a blow that will behead him, is tempted by the sexual advances of Sir Bertilak's wife, decides what to do with the moral conundrum that is the girdle, suffering humiliation, and returning to court to retell his entire adventure.<ref>{{cite journal| last1 = Harbus| first1 = Antonina| year = 2016| title = Emotion and Narrative Empathy in ''Sir Gawain and the Green Knight''| url =| journal = English Studies| volume = 97| issue = 6| pages = 594\u2013607| doi=10.1080/0013838X.2016.1183929}}</ref> These events invite the reader to empathize with Gawain, the flawed hero, and understand that he is also human.\n\nHumans experience an emotional contagion, which was defined by psychologists Elaine Hatfield, John Cacioppo, and Richard Rapson as 'the tendency to automatically mimic and synchronize expressions, vocalizations, postures, and movements with those of another person, and, consequently, to converge emotionally.' <ref>{{cite journal| last1 = Hatfield| first1 = Elaine| last2 = Cacioppo| first2 = John T.| last3 = Rapson| first3 = Richard L.| year = 1993| title = Primitive Emotional Contagion| url =| journal = Current Directions in Psychological Science| volume = 2| issue = 3| pages = 96\u201399| jstor=20182211| doi = 10.1111/1467-8721.ep10770953}}</ref> Amy Coplan explains that emotional contagion is something that happens so quickly and automatically that we are typically unaware of it happening.<ref>{{cite journal| last1 = Coplan| first1 = Amy| year = 2006| title = Catching Characters' Emotions: Emotional Contagion Responses to Narrative Fiction Film| url =| journal = Film Studies| volume = 8| pages = 26\u201338| issn=1469-0314| doi = 10.7227/FS.8.5}}</ref> The poet capitalized on this emotional reaction and thus has the reader empathizing with Sir Gawain almost without realizing it.\n\n==Symbolism==\n\n=== Significance of the colour green ===\n[[Image:Michael Pacher 004.jpg|thumb|In the 15th-century ''[[Saint Wolfgang]] and the Devil'' by [[Michael Pacher]], the [[Devil]] is green.

In [[English folklore]] and literature, green was traditionally used to symbolise nature and its associated attributes: fertility and rebirth.

British medievalist [[C. S. Lewis]] said the character was \"as vivid and concrete as any image in literature\" and [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] said he was the \"most difficult character\" to interpret in ''Sir Gawain''. His major role in Arthurian literature is that of a judge and tester of knights, thus he is at once terrifying, friendly, and mysterious.<ref name = knight/> He appears in only two other poems: ''The Greene Knight'' and ''King Arthur and King Cornwall''.<ref>Hahn, Thomas. \"The Greene Knight\".

In the Death of Curoi (one of the Irish stories from Bricriu's Feast), Curoi stands in for Bertilak, and is often called \"the man of the grey mantle\". Though the words usually used for grey in the Death of Curoi are ''lachtna'' or ''odar'', roughly meaning milk-coloured and shadowy respectively, in later works featuring a green knight, the word ''glas'' is used and may have been the basis of misunderstanding.<ref>{{Cite journal|first=Alice|last=Buchanan|title=The Irish Framework of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight|journal=PLMA|volume=47|issue= 2|date=June 1932|pages=315\u2013338|doi=10.2307/457878|jstor=457878}}</ref>\n\n===Girdle===\n\n{{See also|Girdle#Girdle in literature|l1=Girdle in literature}}\n[[Image:John William Waterhouse - The Lady of Shalott - Google Art Project edit.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Another famous Arthurian woman, [[The Lady of Shalott]], with a medieval [[girdle]] around her waist ([[John William Waterhouse]], 1888)]]\nThe girdle's symbolic meaning, in ''Sir Gawain and the Green Knight'', has been construed in a variety of ways. Interpretations range from sexual to spiritual. Those who argue for the sexual inference view the girdle as a \"trophy\".<ref>. Friedman, Albert B. Morgan le Fay in Sir Gawain and the Green Knight. Medieval Academy of America. Speculum, Vol. 35, No. 2, 1960</ref> It is not entirely clear if the \"winner\" is Sir Gawain or Lady Bertilak. The girdle is given to Gawain by Lady Bertilak to keep him safe when he confronts the Green Knight. When Lord Bertilak comes home from his hunting trip, Gawain does not reveal the girdle to his host, instead he hides it. This introduces the spiritual interpretation, that Gawain's acceptance of the girdle is a sign of his faltering faith in God, at least in the face of death.<ref>Berger, Sidney E. \"Gawain's Departure from the Peregrinatio\". Morgantown: West Virginia University Press, 1985.</ref> To some, the Green Knight is Christ, who overcomes death, while Gawain is the Every Christian, who in his struggles to follow Christ faithfully, chooses the easier path. In ''Sir Gawain'', the easier choice is the girdle, which promises what Gawain most desires. Faith in God, alternatively, requires one's acceptance that what one most desires does not always coincide with what God has planned. It is arguably best to view the girdle not as an either\u2013or situation, but as a complex, multi-faceted symbol that acts to test Gawain in more ways than one.  While Gawain is able to resist Bertilak's wife's sexual advances, he is unable to resist the powers of the girdle. Gawain is operating under the laws of chivalry which, evidently, have rules that can contradict each other. In the story of ''Sir Gawain'', Gawain finds himself torn between doing what a damsel asks (accepting the girdle) and keeping his promise (returning anything given to him while his host is away).<ref>Burrow, J.\u00a0A. A Reading of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight.

What is more, the poet uses a total of 46 lines in order to describe the meaning of the pentangle; no other symbol in the poem receives as much attention or is described in such detail.<ref>Arthur, Ross G. ''Medieval Sign Theory and Sir Gawain and the Green Knight''. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1987. pp.&nbsp;22, 26. {{ISBN|0-8020-5717-9}}</ref> The poem describes the pentangle as a symbol of faithfulness and an \"endless knot\". From lines 640 to 654, the five points of the pentangle relate directly to Gawain in five ways: five senses, his five fingers, his faith found in the [[five wounds of Christ]], the five joys of [[Holy Mary|Mary]] (whose face was on the inside of the shield) and finally friendship, fraternity, purity, politeness and pity (traits that Gawain possessed around others). In line 625, it is described as \"a sign by Solomon\". [[Solomon]], the third king of [[Israel]], in the 10th century BC, was said to have the mark of the pentagram on his ring, which he received from the [[archangel]] [[Michael (archangel)|Michael]]. The pentagram seal on this ring was said to give Solomon power over [[demons]].<ref>LaBossi\u00e8re, Camille R., and [[Jerry Gladson|Gladson, Jerry A.]] \"Solomon\", in ''A Dictionary of Biblical Tradition in English Literature''. Grand Rapids, Michigan: William B. Eerdmans Publishing Company, 1992 p.&nbsp;722.</ref>\n\nAlong these lines, some academics link the Gawain pentangle to magical traditions. In Germany, the symbol was called a ''Drudenfu\u00df'' and was placed on household objects to keep out evil.<ref name = Hulbert>Hulbert, J. R. \"Syr Gawayn and the Grene Knyzt (Concluded)\". ''Modern Philology''. (April 1916) 13.12 pp.&nbsp;689\u2013730.</ref> The symbol was also associated with magical charms that, if recited or written on a weapon, would call forth magical forces. However, concrete evidence tying the magical pentagram to Gawain's pentangle is scarce.<ref name = Hulbert/><ref>Jackson, I. \"Sir Gawain's Coat of Arms.\" ''The Modern Language Review''. (January 1920) 15.1 pp.&nbsp;77\u201379.</ref>\n\nGawain's pentangle also symbolises the \"phenomenon of physically endless objects signifying a temporally endless quality.\"<ref>Arthur, pp.&nbsp;33\u201334.</ref> Many poets use the symbol of the circle to show infinity or endlessness, but Gawain's poet insisted on using something more complex. In medieval number theory, the number five is considered a \"circular number\", since it \"reproduces itself in its last digit when raised to its powers\".<ref name=\"rossfour\">Arthur, p.&nbsp;34.</ref> Furthermore, it replicates itself geometrically; that is, every pentangle has a smaller pentagon that allows a pentangle to be embedded in it and this \"process may be repeated forever with decreasing pentangles\".<ref name=\"rossfour\"/> Thus, by reproducing the number five, which in medieval number symbolism signified incorruptibility, Gawain's pentangle represents his eternal incorruptibility.<ref>Arthur, p.&nbsp;35.</ref>\n\n===The Lady's Ring===\nGawain's refusal of the Lady Bertilak's ring has major implications for the remainder of the story. While the modern student may tend to pay more attention to the girdle as the eminent object offered by the lady, readers in the time of Gawain would have noticed the significance of the offer of the ring as they believed that rings, and especially the embedded gems, had talismanic properties similarly done by the Gawain-poet in ''Pearl''.<ref name=\"cooke\">{{Cite journal|last=Cooke|first=Jessica|year=1998|title=The Lady's 'Blushing' Ring in ''Sir Gawain and the Green Knight''|journal=[[The Review of English Studies]]|volume=49|issue=193|pages=1\u20138|doi=10.1093/res/49.193.1}}</ref> This is especially true of the lady's ring as scholars believe it to be a [[ruby]] or carbuncle, indicated when the Gawain-Poet describes it as a \"brygt sunne\" (line 1819),<ref>{{Cite book|last=Andrew|first=Malcolm|author2=Ronald Waldron|title=The Poems of the Pearl Manuscript|publisher=University of Exeter Press|location=Exeter|year=1996|page=[https://archive.org/details/poemsofpearlmanu0000brit_r3l6/page/273 273]|isbn=0-85989-514-9|url=https://archive.org/details/poemsofpearlmanu0000brit_r3l6/page/273}}</ref> a \"fiery sun.\"<ref>{{Cite book|last=Borroff|first=Marie|title=Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, Patience, Pearl: Verse Translations|publisher=Norton|location=New York|year=2001|page=[https://archive.org/details/sirgawaingreenkn00mari/page/58 58]|isbn=978-0-393-97658-8|url=https://archive.org/details/sirgawaingreenkn00mari/page/58}}</ref> This red colour can be seen as symbolizing royalty, divinity, and the Passion of the Christ, something that Gawain as a knight of the Round Table would strive for,<ref>Cooke, \"The Lady's 'Blushing,'\" 3.</ref> but this colour could also represent the negative qualities of temptation and covetousness.<ref>Cooke, \"The Lady's 'Blushing,'\" 4.</ref> Given the importance of magic rings in [[Arthurian romance]], this remarkable ring would also have been believed to protect the wearer from harm just as Lady Bertilak claims the girdle will.<ref>Cooke, \"The Lady's 'Blushing,'\" 2,5,7.</ref>\n\n===Numbers===\nThe poet highlights number symbolism to add symmetry and meaning to the poem. For example, three kisses are exchanged between Gawain and Bertilak's wife; Gawain is tempted by her on three separate days; Bertilak goes hunting three times, and the Green Knight swings at Gawain three times with his axe. The number two also appears repeatedly, as in the two beheading scenes, two confession scenes, and two castles.<ref>Howard, Donald R. \"Structure and Symmetry in Sir Gawain\". ''Speculum''. (July 1964) 39.3 pp.&nbsp;425\u2013433.</ref> The five points of the pentangle, the poet adds, represent Gawain's virtues, for he is \"faithful five ways and five times each\".<ref>''Sir Gawain and the Green Knight'', Book 2, Stanza 27.</ref> The poet goes on to list the ways in which Gawain is virtuous: all five of his senses are without fault; his five fingers never fail him, and he always remembers the [[Rosary#Sorrowful Mysteries|five wounds of Christ]], as well as the [[Rosary#Joyful Mysteries|five joys]] of the [[Virgin Mary]]. The fifth five is Gawain himself, who embodies the five moral virtues of the code of [[chivalry]]: \"[[friendship]], [[generosity]], [[chastity]], [[courtesy]], and [[piety]]\".<ref>Kittredge, p.&nbsp;93.</ref> All of these virtues reside, as the poet says, in the \"Endless Knot\" of the pentangle, which forever interlinks and is never broken.<ref>''Sir Gawain and the Green Knight'', Book 2, Stanza 28.</ref> This intimate relationship between symbol and faith allows for rigorous allegorical interpretation, especially in the physical role that the shield plays in Gawain's quest.<ref>Mills, M. \"Christian Significance and Roman Tradition in Sir Gawain and the Green Knight.\" Critical Studies of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight. Eds. Donald R. Howard & Christian Zacher. 2nd ed.

Through the five points of the pentangle the reader is presented with the five dilemmas of Sir Gawain. The Green Knight's challenge is the first: known for his valour and courtesy, Gawain would damage his reputation by refusing it. In accepting the challenge of the Green Knight, Gawain enters into his second dilemma. He must escape with both his life and honour intact.<ref>Engelhardt, George J. \"The Predicament of Gawain.\" ''Modern Language Quarterly''. (Sep 1955) 16.3 p.&nbsp;61.</ref> Gawain enters into a bargain with Bertilak which leads to his third dilemma: \"Whatever I win in the woods I will give you at eve, and all you have earned you must offer to me.\"<ref>''Sir Gawain and the Green Knight'', lines&nbsp;1105\u201308.</ref> With a \"gift of body\",<ref>Engelhardt, George J. \"The Predicament of Gawain.\" ''Modern Language Quarterly''. (Sep 1955) 16.3 p.&nbsp;62.</ref> Gawain is tempted by Bertilak's wife. He cannot exchange this gift with Bertilak, nor can he, a knight of renowned courtesy, refuse it. Gawain must refuse the lady\u2019s attempts at [[seduction]], yet he must do so courteously; this dilemma is his fourth. Gawain encounters his fifth dilemma when he accepts the gift of the girdle. He agrees to hide it from Bertilak, yet his bargain with the lord requires him to exchange it. -->\n\nThe number five is also found in the structure of the poem itself. ''Sir Gawain'' is 101&nbsp;stanzas long, traditionally organised into four 'Fits' of 21, 24, 34, and 22&nbsp;stanzas. These divisions, however, have since been disputed; scholars have begun to believe that they are the work of the copyist and not of the poet. The surviving manuscript features a series of capital letters added after the fact by another scribe, and some scholars argue that these additions were an attempt to restore the original divisions. These letters divide the manuscript into nine parts. The first and last parts are 22&nbsp;stanzas long. The second and second-to-last parts are only one stanza long, and the middle five parts are eleven stanzas long. The number eleven is associated with transgression in other medieval literature (being one more than ten, a number associated with the [[Ten Commandments]]). Thus, this set of five elevens (55 stanzas) creates the perfect mix of transgression and incorruption, suggesting that Gawain is faultless in his faults.<ref name =stanza>Robertson, Michael. \"Stanzaic Symmetry in Sir Gawain and the Green Knight\". ''Speculum''. (October 1982) 57.4 pp.&nbsp;779\u2013785.</ref>\n\n===Wounds===\nAt the story's climax, Gawain is wounded superficially in the neck by the Green Knight's axe. During the medieval period, the body and the soul were believed to be so intimately connected that wounds were considered an outward sign of inward sin. The neck, specifically, was believed to correlate with the part of the soul related to [[Will (philosophy)|will]], connecting the reasoning part (the head) and the courageous part (the heart). Gawain's sin resulted from using his will to separate reasoning from courage. By accepting the girdle from the lady, he employs reason to do something less than courageous\u2014evade death in a dishonest way. Gawain's wound is thus an outward sign of an internal wound. The Green Knight's series of tests shows Gawain the weakness that has been in him all along: the desire to use his will pridefully for personal gain, rather than submitting his will in humility to God. The Green Knight, by engaging with the greatest knight of Camelot, also reveals the moral weakness of pride in all of Camelot, and therefore all of humanity. However, the wounds of Christ, believed to offer healing to wounded souls and bodies, are mentioned throughout the poem in the hope that this sin of prideful \"stiffneckedness\" will be healed among fallen mortals.<ref>{{Cite journal|doi=10.2307/462158|last=Reichardt|first=Paul F.|year=1984|title=Gawain and the Image of the Wound|journal=PMLA|volume=99|issue=2|pages=154\u201361|jstor=462158}}</ref><ref>Arthur, pp.&nbsp;121\u2013123.</ref>\n\n==Interpretations==\n\n=== ''Gawain'' as medieval romance ===\n{{Further|Order of the Garter|Romance (heroic literature)}}\n[[Image:Pettie, The Vigil.jpg|thumb|right|Gawain represented the perfect knight, as a fighter, a lover, and a religious devotee. (''The Vigil'' by [[John Pettie]], 1884)]]\nMany critics argue that ''Sir Gawain and the Green Knight'' should be viewed, above all, as a [[Romance (heroic literature)|romance]]. Medieval romances typically recount the marvellous adventures of a chivalrous, [[hero]]ic [[knight]], often of super-human ability, who abides by chivalry's strict codes of honour and demeanour, embarks upon a [[quest]] and defeats monsters, thereby winning the favour of a [[princesse lointaine|lady]]. Thus, medieval romances focus not on love and sentiment (as the term \"romance\" implies today), but on [[adventure novel|adventure]].<ref>Frye, Northrop. ''[[Anatomy of Criticism]]'', p.&nbsp;186. {{ISBN|0-691-01298-9}}</ref>\n\nGawain's function, as medieval scholar Alan Markman says, \"is the function of the romance hero&nbsp;\u2026 to stand as the champion of the human race, and by submitting to strange and severe tests, to demonstrate human capabilities for good or bad action.\"<ref name = markman/> Through Gawain's adventure, it becomes clear that he is merely human. The reader becomes attached to this human view in the midst of the poem's romanticism, relating to Gawain's humanity while respecting his knightly qualities. Gawain \"shows us what moral conduct is. We shall probably not equal his behaviour, but we admire him for pointing out the way.\"<ref name = markman>Markman, Alan M. \"The Meaning of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight\". ''PMLA''. (September 1957) 72.4 pp.&nbsp;574\u2013586</ref>\n\nIn viewing the poem as a medieval romance, many scholars see it as intertwining chivalric and [[courtly love]] laws under the English [[Order of the Garter]]. The group's motto, 'honi soit qui mal y pense', or \"Shamed be he who finds evil here,\" is written at the end of the poem. Some critics describe Gawain's peers wearing girdles of their own as evidence of the origin of the Order of the Garter. However, in the parallel poem ''[[The Greene Knight]]'', the lace is white, not green, and is considered the origin of the collar worn by the knights of the Bath, not the Order of the Garter.<ref>''Sir Gawain and the Green Knight'', second edition.

Still, the connection made by the copyist to the Order is not extraordinary.<ref>''The Norton Anthology of English Literature'', eighth edition, Vol. BEd Stephen Greenblatt. New York, London: W. W. Norton and Co., 2006, p.&nbsp;213 (footnote). {{ISBN|0-393-92833-0}}</ref>\n\n===Christian interpretations===\n[[Image:Adam-und-Eva-1513.jpg|thumb|Scholars have pointed out parallels between the girdle Bertilak's wife offers Gawain, and the fruit [[Eve]] offered to [[Adam]] in the Biblical [[Garden of Eden]]. (''Adam and Eve'' [[Lucas Cranach the Elder|Lucas Cranach]], ca. 1513)]]\n\nThe poem is in many ways deeply Christian, with frequent references to the fall of Adam and Eve and to Jesus Christ. Scholars have debated the depth of the Christian elements within the poem by looking at it in the context of the age in which it was written, coming up with varying views as to what represents a Christian element of the poem and what does not. For example, some critics compare ''Sir Gawain'' to the other three poems of the ''Gawain'' manuscript. Each has a heavily Christian theme, causing scholars to interpret ''Gawain'' similarly. Comparing it to the poem ''[[Cleanness]]'' (also known as ''Purity''), for example, they see it as a story of the [[Apocalyptic literature|apocalyptic]] fall of a civilisation, in ''Gawain's'' case, Camelot. In this interpretation, Sir Gawain is like [[Noah]], separated from his society and warned by the Green Knight (who is seen as God's representative) of the coming doom of Camelot. Gawain, judged worthy through his test, is spared the doom of the rest of Camelot. King Arthur and his knights, however, misunderstand Gawain's experience and wear garters themselves. In ''Cleanness'' the men who are saved are similarly helpless in warning their society of impending destruction.<ref name = christian/>\n\nOne of the key points stressed in this interpretation is that salvation is an individual experience difficult to communicate to outsiders. In his depiction of Camelot, the poet reveals a concern for his society, whose inevitable fall will bring about the ultimate destruction intended by God. ''Gawain'' was written around the time of the [[Black Death]] and [[English peasants' revolt of 1381|Peasants' Revolt]], events which convinced many people that their world was coming to an apocalyptic end and this belief was reflected in literature and culture.<ref name = christian/> However, other critics see weaknesses in this view, since the Green Knight is ultimately under the control of Morgan le Fay, often viewed as a figure of evil in Camelot tales. This makes the knight's presence as a representative of God problematic.<ref name = game>Goodlad, Lauren M. (1987) [http://repositories.cdlib.org/cmrs/comitatus/vol18/iss1/art4 \"The Gamnes of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight\"], ''Comitatus: A Journal of Medieval and Renaissance Studies'', Vol. 18, Article 4.</ref>\n\nWhile the character of the Green Knight is usually not viewed as a representation of Christ in ''Sir Gawain and the Green Knight'', critics do acknowledge a parallel. Lawrence Besserman, a specialist in medieval literature, explains that \"the Green Knight is not a figurative representative of Christ. But the idea of Christ's divine/human nature provides a medieval conceptual framework that supports the poet's serious/comic account of the Green Knight's supernatural/human qualities and actions.\" This duality exemplifies the influence and importance of Christian teachings and views of Christ in the era of the Gawain Poet.<ref name = knight/>\n\nFurthermore, critics note the Christian reference to Christ's crown of thorns at the conclusion of ''Sir Gawain and the Green Knight''. After Gawain returns to Camelot and tells his story regarding the newly acquired green sash, the poem concludes with a brief prayer and a reference to \"the thorn-crowned God\".<ref>''Sir Gawain and the Green Knight'', line 2529.</ref> Besserman theorises that \"with these final words the poet redirects our attention from the circular girdle-turned-sash (a double image of Gawain's \"yntrawpe/renoun\") to the circular Crown of Thorns (a double image of Christ's humiliation turned triumph).\"<ref name = knight/>\n\nThroughout the poem, Gawain encounters numerous trials testing his devotion and faith in Christianity. When Gawain sets out on his journey to find the Green Chapel, he finds himself lost, and only after praying to the [[Virgin Mary]] does he find his way. As he continues his journey, Gawain once again faces anguish regarding his inevitable encounter with the Green Knight. Instead of praying to Mary, as before, Gawain places his faith in the girdle given to him by Bertilak's wife. From the Christian perspective, this leads to disastrous and embarrassing consequences for Gawain as he is forced to reevaluate his faith when the Green Knight points out his betrayal.<ref name=\"cox\">Cox, Catherine.

The Gawain poet uses a [[English Midlands|North West Midlands]] dialect common on the Welsh\u2013English border, potentially placing him in the midst of this conflict. Patricia Clare Ingham is credited with first viewing the poem through the lens of [[postcolonialism]], and since then a great deal of dispute has emerged over the extent to which colonial differences play a role in the poem. Most critics agree that gender plays a role, but differ about whether gender supports the colonial ideals or replaces them as English and Welsh cultures interact in the poem.<ref name = arner>{{cite journal| last1 = Arner| first1 = Lynn| year = Summer 2006| title = The Ends of Enchantment: Colonialism and Sir Gawain and the Green Knight| url =| journal = Texas Studies in Literature and Language| volume = 48| issue = 2| pages = 79\u2013101| doi=10.1353/tsl.2006.0006}}</ref>\n\nA large amount of critical debate also surrounds the poem as it relates to the bi-cultural political landscape of the time. Some argue that Bertilak is an example of the hybrid Anglo-Welsh culture found on the Welsh\u2013English border. They therefore view the poem as a reflection of a hybrid culture that plays strong cultures off one another to create a new set of cultural rules and traditions. Other scholars, however, argue that historically much Welsh blood was shed well into the 14th century, creating a situation far removed from the more friendly hybridisation suggested by Ingham. To support this argument further, it is suggested that the poem creates an \"us versus them\" scenario contrasting the knowledgeable civilised English with the uncivilised borderlands that are home to Bertilak and the other monsters that Gawain encounters.<ref name=\"arner\" />\n\nIn contrast to this perception of the colonial lands, others argue that the land of Hautdesert, Bertilak's territory, has been misrepresented or ignored in modern criticism. They suggest that it is a land with its own moral agency, one that plays a central role in the story. Bonnie Lander, for example, argues that the denizens of Hautdesert are \"intelligently immoral\", choosing to follow certain codes and rejecting others, a position which creates a \"distinction&nbsp;\u2026 of moral insight versus moral faith\". Lander thinks that the border dwellers are more sophisticated because they do not unthinkingly embrace the chivalric codes but challenge them in a philosophical, and\u2014in the case of Bertilak's appearance at Arthur's court\u2014literal sense. Lander's argument about the superiority of the denizens of Hautdesert hinges on the lack of self-awareness present in Camelot, which leads to an unthinking populace that frowns on individualism. In this view, it is not Bertilak and his people, but Arthur and his court, who are the monsters.<ref name = lander>{{cite journal| last1 = Lander| first1 = Bonnie| year = 2007| title = The Convention of Innocence and Sir Gawain and the Green Knight's Literary Sophisticates| url =| journal = Parergon| volume = 24| issue = 1| pages = 41\u201366| doi=10.1353/pgn.2007.0046}}</ref>\n\n===Gawain's journey===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Hollywell.jpg|thumb|[[Saint Winifred|St. Winifred's]] well in [[Holywell, Flintshire|Holywell, Wales|]], Wales, possibly one of Gawain's stopping points on the way to the Green Chapel]] -->\nSeveral scholars have attempted to find a real-world correspondence for Gawain's journey to the Green Chapel. The [[Anglesey]] islands, for example, are mentioned in the poem. They exist today as a single island off the coast of Wales.<ref>{{cite web| last =Twomey| first =Michael| authorlink =| title =Anglesey and North Wales| work =Travels With Sir Gawain| publisher =Ithaca Univ| url =http://www.ithaca.edu/faculty/twomey/travels/sggk_frameset.htm| doi =| accessdate =2007-06-21 }}</ref> In line 700, Gawain is said to pass the \"Holy Head\", believed by many scholars to be either [[Holywell, Flintshire|Holywell]] or the [[Cistercians|Cistercian]] abbey of Poulton in [[Pulford]]. Holywell is associated with the beheading of [[Winefride|Saint Winifred]]. As the story goes, Winifred was a virgin who was beheaded by a local leader after she refused his sexual advances. Her uncle, another saint, put her head back in place and healed the wound, leaving only a white scar. The parallels between this story and Gawain's make this area a likely candidate for the journey.<ref>{{cite web| last =Twomey| first =Michael| authorlink =| title =The Holy Head and the Wirral| work =Travels With Sir Gawain| publisher =Ithaca Univ| url =http://www.ithaca.edu/faculty/twomey/travels/sggk_frameset.htm| doi =| accessdate =2007-06-21 }}</ref>\n\nGawain's trek leads him directly into the centre of the Pearl Poet's dialect region, where the candidates for the locations of the Castle at Hautdesert and the Green Chapel stand. Hautdesert is thought to be in the area of Swythamley in northwest Midland, as it lies in the writer's dialect area and matches the topographical features described in the poem. The area is also known to have housed all of the animals hunted by Bertilak (deer, boar, fox) in the 14th century.<ref>{{cite web| last =Twomey| first =Michael| authorlink =| title =Hautdesert| work =Travels With Sir Gawain| publisher =Ithaca Univ| url =http://www.ithaca.edu/faculty/twomey/travels/sggk_frameset.htm| doi =| accessdate =2007-06-21 }}</ref> The Green Chapel is thought to be in either [[Lud's Church]] or [[Wetton Mill]], as these areas closely match the descriptions given by the author.<ref>{{cite web| last =Twomey| first =Michael| authorlink =| title =The Green Chapel| work =Travels With Sir Gawain| publisher =Ithaca Univ| url =http://www.ithaca.edu/faculty/twomey/travels/sggk_frameset.htm| doi =| accessdate =2007-06-21 }}</ref> [[Ralph Elliott]] located the chapel (\"two myle henne\" v1078) from the old manor house at Swythamley Park at the bottom of a valley (\"bothm of the brem valay\" v2145) on a hillside (\"loke a littel on the launde, on thi lyfte honde\" v2147) in an enormous fissure (\"an olde caue,/or a creuisse of an olde cragge\" v2182-83).<ref>RWV Elliott. \"Searching for the Green Chapel\" in JK Lloyd Jones (ed).

Zeikowitz argues that the narrator of the poem seems entranced by the Knight's beauty, homoeroticising him in poetic form. The Green Knight's attractiveness challenges the homosocial rules of King Arthur's court and poses a threat to their way of life. Zeikowitz also states that Gawain seems to find Bertilak as attractive as the narrator finds the Green Knight. Bertilak, however, follows the homosocial code and develops a friendship with Gawain. Gawain's embracing and kissing Bertilak in several scenes thus represents not a homosexual but a homosocial expression. Men of the time often embraced and kissed and this was acceptable under the chivalric code. Nonetheless, the Green Knight blurs the lines between homosociality and homosexuality, representing the difficulty medieval writers sometimes had in separating the two.<ref>Zeikowitz, Richard E. \"Befriending the Medieval Queer: A Pedagogy for Literature Classes.\" ''College English: Special Issue: Lesbian and Gay Studies/Queer Pedagogies.'' Vol. 65 No. 1  (Sep 2002) pp. 67\u201380</ref>\n\n[[Carolyn Dinshaw]] argues that the poem may have been a response to accusations that [[Richard II of England|Richard II]] had a male lover\u2014an attempt to reestablish the idea that heterosexuality was the Christian norm. Around the time the poem was written, the Catholic Church was beginning to express concerns about kissing between males. Many religious figures were trying to make the distinction between strong trust and friendship between males and homosexuality. Still, the Pearl Poet seems to have been simultaneously entranced and repulsed by homosexual desire. In his other poem ''Cleanness'', he points out several grievous sins, but spends lengthy passages describing them in minute detail. His obsession seems to carry into ''Gawain'' in his descriptions of the Green Knight.<ref name=\"dinshaw1994\">Dinshaw, Carolyn. \"A Kiss Is Just a Kiss: Heterosexuality and Its Consolations in Sir Gawain and the Green Knight.\" ''Diacritics''. Vol. 24 No. 2/3 (Summer 1994) pp. 204\u2013226</ref>\n\nBeyond this, Dinshaw proposes that Gawain can be read as a woman-like figure. He is the passive one in the advances of Lady Bertilak, as well as in his encounters with Lord Bertilak, where he acts the part of a woman in kissing the man. However, while the poem does have homosexual elements, these elements are brought up by the poet in order to establish heterosexuality as the normal lifestyle of Gawain's world. The poem does this by making the kisses between Lady Bertilak and Gawain sexual in nature, but rendering the kisses between Gawain and Lord Bertilak \"unintelligible\" to the medieval reader. In other words, the poet portrays kisses between a man and a woman as having the possibility of leading to sex, while in a heterosexual world kisses between a man and a man are portrayed as having no such possibility.<ref name=dinshaw1994/>\n\n==Modern adaptations==\n\n=== Books ===\nThough the surviving manuscript dates from the fourteenth century, the first published version of the poem did not appear until as late as 1839, when [[Sir Frederic Madden]] of the British Museum recognized the poem as worth reading.<ref name=manus>Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, ed.

Stone had referred Bogdanov to ''Cuchulain and the Beheading Game'', a sequence which is contained in The [[Grenoside]] Sword dance. Bogdanov found the pentangle theme to be contained in most sword dances, and so incorporated a long sword dance while Gawain lay tossing uneasily before getting up to go to the Green Chapel. The dancers made the knot of the pentangle around his drowsing head with their swords. The interlacing of the hunting and wooing scenes was achieved by frequent cutting of the action from hunt to bed-chamber and back again, while the locale of both remained on-stage.\n\nIn 1992 [[Simon Corble]] created an adaptation with medieval songs and music for The Midsommer Actors' Company.<ref>{{cite web| url=http://www.corble.co.uk/page_1212407743203.html| title=Sir Gawain and the Green Knight: A Seasonal Play in Verse with Medieval Christmas Songs and Music| work=Simon Corble website| accessdate=6 May 2016}}</ref> performed as [[Site-specific theatre|walkabout productions]] in the summer 1992<ref>{{cite news|last=Turner|first=Francesca|title=Gawayne and the Green Knight|newspaper=The Guardian|date=7 July 1992}}</ref> at [[Thurstaston Common]] and [[Beeston Castle]] and in August 1995 at [[Brimham Rocks]], North Yorkshire.<ref>[https://www.flickr.com/search/?q=Gawain&w=9470542%40N07 photos from Midsommer Actors archive on flickr]</ref> Corble later wrote a substantially revised version which was produced indoors at the [[O'Reilly Theatre]], Oxford in February 2014.<ref>{{cite news|last=Nirula|first=Srishti|title=Sir Gawain pulls our strings|url=http://oxfordstudent.com/2014/02/16/sir-gawain-pulls-our-strings/|accessdate=17 February 2014|newspaper=The Oxford Student|date=16 February 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Hopkins|first=Andrea|title=Sir Gawain and the Green Knight|url=http://www.dailyinfo.co.uk/reviews/feature/9002/Sir_Gawain_And_The_Green_Knight|accessdate=18 February 2014|newspaper=Daily Info, Oxford|date=15 February 2014}}</ref>\n\n===Opera===\n''Sir Gawain and the Green Knight'' was first adapted as an opera in 1978 by the composer [[Richard Blackford]] on commission from the village of [[Blewbury]], Oxfordshire.

It is an important example of a [[Romance (heroic literature)|chivalric romance]], which typically involves a hero who goes on a quest which tests his prowess. It remains popular in modern English renderings from [[J. R. R. Tolkien]], [[Simon Armitage]] and others, as well as through film and stage adaptations.\n\nIt describes how Sir [[Gawain]], a knight of [[King Arthur]]'s [[Round Table]], accepts a challenge from a mysterious \"[[Green Knight]]\" who dares any knight to strike him with his axe if he will take a return blow in a [[Year and a day rule|year and a day]]. Gawain accepts and beheads him with his blow, at which the Green Knight stands up, picks up his head and reminds Gawain of the appointed time. In his struggles to keep his bargain, Gawain demonstrates [[chivalry]] and [[loyalty]] until his honour is called into question by a test involving [[Lady Bertilak]], the lady of the Green Knight's castle.\n\nThe poem survives in one manuscript, ''Cotton Nero A.x.'', which also includes three religious [[narrative poetry|narrative poems]]: ''[[Pearl (poem)|Pearl]]'', ''[[Cleanness (poem)|Purity]]'' and ''[[Patience (poem)|Patience]]''.

A gigantic figure, entirely green in appearance and riding a green horse, rides unexpectedly into the hall. He wears no armour but bears an axe in one hand and a holly bough in the other. Refusing to fight anyone there on the grounds that they are all too weak to take him on, he insists he has come for a friendly [[christmas game]]: someone is to strike him once with his axe on the condition that the Green Knight may return the blow in a year and a day.<ref>First found in English c.1400, a phrase 'specified in certain legal matters in order to ensure the completion of a full year': comparable terms date from slightly earlier in Middle Dutch, Middle Low German and Anglo-Norman. From :\"year, n.\" OED Online. Oxford University Press, March 2017. Web. 15 March 2017.</ref> The splendid axe will belong to whoever accepts this deal. Arthur himself is prepared to accept the challenge when it appears no other knight will dare, but Sir Gawain, youngest of Arthur's knights and his nephew, asks for the honour instead. The giant bends and bares his neck before him and Gawain neatly beheads him in one stroke. However, the Green Knight neither falls nor falters, but instead reaches out, picks up his severed head and remounts, holding up his bleeding head to Queen [[Guinevere]] while its writhing lips remind Gawain that the two must meet again at the [[Green Chapel]]. He then rides away. Gawain and Arthur admire the axe, hang it up as a trophy and encourage Guinevere to treat the whole matter lightly.\n\nAs the date approaches, Sir Gawain sets off to find the Green Chapel and keep his side of the bargain. Many adventures and battles are alluded to (but not described) until Gawain comes across a splendid castle where he meets Bertilak de Hautdesert, the lord of the castle, and his beautiful wife, who are pleased to have such a renowned guest. Also present is an old and ugly lady, unnamed but treated with great honour by all. Gawain tells them of his New Year's appointment at the Green Chapel and that he only has a few days remaining. Bertilak laughs, explaining that there is a path that will take him to there less than two miles away, and proposes that Gawain rest at the castle until then. Relieved and grateful, Gawain agrees.\n\nBefore going hunting the next day, Bertilak proposes a bargain: he will give Gawain whatever he catches on the condition that Gawain give him whatever he might gain during the day. Gawain accepts. After Bertilak leaves, [[Lady Bertilak]] visits Gawain's bedroom and behaves seductively, but despite her best efforts he yields nothing but a single kiss in his unwillingness to offend her. When Bertilak returns and gives Gawain the deer he has killed, his guest gives a kiss to Bertilak without divulging its source. The next day the lady comes again, Gawain again courteously foils her advances, and later that day there is a similar exchange of a hunted [[boar]] for two kisses. She comes once more on the third morning, but once her advances are denied, she offers Gawain a gold ring as a keepsake. He gently but steadfastly refuses but she pleads that he at least take her belt, a girdle of green and gold silk. The belt, the lady assures him, is charmed and will keep him from all physical harm. Tempted, as he may otherwise die the next day, Gawain accepts it, and they exchange three kisses. The lady has Gawain swear that he will keep the gift secret from Bertilak. That evening, Bertilak returns with a fox, which he exchanges with Gawain for the three kisses \u2013 but Gawain says nothing of the girdle.\n\nThe next day, Gawain binds the belt twice around his waist. He finds the Green Knight sharpening an axe and, as promised, Gawain bends his bared neck to receive his blow. At the first swing, Gawain flinches slightly and the Green Knight belittles him for it. Ashamed of himself, Gawain doesn't flinch with the second swing; but again the Green Knight withholds the full force of his blow. The knight explains he was testing Gawain's nerve. Angrily Gawain tells him to deliver his blow and so the knight does, causing only a slight wound on Gawain's neck. The game is over. Gawain seizes his sword, helmet and shield, but the Green Knight, laughing, reveals himself to be the lord of the castle, Bertilak de Hautdesert, transformed by magic. He explains that the entire adventure was a trick of the \"elderly lady\" Gawain saw at the castle, who is actually the sorceress [[Morgan le Fay]], Arthur's sister, who intended to test Arthur's knights and frighten Guinevere to death.<ref>{{cite book|title=Masters of British Literature Volume A|year=2008|publisher=Pearson Longman|isbn=9780321333995|pages=[https://archive.org/details/mastersofbritish0000unse/page/200 200\u2013201]|url=https://archive.org/details/mastersofbritish0000unse/page/200}}</ref> Gawain is ashamed to have behaved deceitfully but the Green Knight laughs and professes him the most blameless knight in all the land. The two part on cordial terms. Gawain returns to Camelot wearing the girdle as a token of his failure to keep his promise. The [[Knights of the Round Table]] absolve him of blame and decide that henceforth each will wear a green [[sash]] in recognition of Gawain's adventure and as a reminder to be always honest.\n\n==\"Gawain Poet\"==\n{{Main|Gawain Poet}}  \nThough the real name of \"The ''Gawain'' Poet\" (or poets) is unknown, some inferences about him can be drawn from an informed reading of his works. The manuscript of ''Gawain'' is known in academic circles as ''Cotton Nero A.x.'', following a naming system used by one of its owners, [[Robert Bruce Cotton|Robert Cotton]], a collector of Medieval English texts.<ref name=\"ucalgary\"/> Before the ''Gawain'' manuscript came into Cotton's possession, it was in the library of Henry Savile in [[Yorkshire]].<ref>{{cite web| title = Pearl: Introduction| publisher = Medieval Institute Publications, Inc.| year = 2001| url = http://www.lib.rochester.edu/camelot/teams/pearlint.htm| accessdate = 2007-04-02}}</ref> Little is known about its previous ownership, and until 1824, when the manuscript was introduced to the academic community in a second edition of [[Thomas Warton]]'s ''History'' edited by [[Richard Price (British historian)|Richard Price]], it was almost entirely unknown. Even then, the ''Gawain'' poem was not published in its entirety until 1839.<ref>Turville-Petre, Thorlac. The Alliterative Revival. Woodbridge: Brewer [[etc.]], 1977. pp.&nbsp;126\u2013129. {{ISBN|0-85991-019-9}}</ref><ref>Burrow, J. ''Ricardian Poetry.'' London: Routledge and K.

''The Broadview Anthology of British Literature: The Medieval Period'', Vol. 1., ed. Joseph Black, ''et al.'' Toronto: Broadview Press, Introduction, p.&nbsp;235. {{ISBN|1-55111-609-X}}</ref> The three other works found in the same manuscript as ''Gawain'' (commonly known as ''[[Pearl (poem)|Pearl]]'', ''[[Patience (poem)|Patience]]'', and ''[[Cleanness (poem)|Purity]]'' or ''Cleanliness'') are often considered to be written by the same author. However, the manuscript containing these poems was transcribed by a copyist and not by the original poet. Although nothing explicitly suggests that all four poems are by the same poet, comparative analysis of dialect, verse form, and diction have pointed towards single authorship.<ref name = poet>Nelles, William. \"The Pearl-Poet\". ''Cyclopedia of World Authors'', Fourth Revised Edition Database: MagillOnLiterature Plus, 1958.</ref>\n\nWhat is known today about the poet is largely general. As [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] and [[E. V. Gordon]], after reviewing the text's allusions, style, and themes, concluded in 1925:\n{{quote|He was a man of serious and devout mind, though not without humour; he had an interest in theology, and some knowledge of it, though an amateur knowledge perhaps, rather than a professional; he had Latin and French and was well enough read in French books, both romantic and instructive; but his home was in the West Midlands of England; so much his language shows, and his metre, and his scenery.<ref name = Tolkien/>}}\n\nThe most commonly suggested candidate for authorship is [[John Massey (poet)|John Massey]] of Cotton, Cheshire.<ref>{{cite journal| last1 = Peterson| first1 = Clifford J| year = 1974| title = The Pearl-Poet and John Massey of Cotton, Cheshire| url =| journal = The Review of English Studies |series=New Series| volume = 25| issue = 99| pages = 257\u2013266| doi=10.1093/res/xxv.99.257}}</ref> He is known to have lived in the dialect region of the Gawain Poet and is thought to have written the poem ''[[St. Erkenwald (poem)|St. Erkenwald]]'', which some scholars argue bears stylistic similarities to ''Gawain''. ''St. Erkenwald'', however, has been dated by some scholars to a time outside the Gawain Poet's era. Thus, ascribing authorship to John Massey is still controversial and most critics consider the Gawain Poet an unknown.<ref name = poet/>\n\n==Verse form==\nThe 2,530 lines and 101 [[stanzas]] that make up ''Sir Gawain and the Green Knight'' are written in what linguists call the \"[[Alliterative Revival]]\" style typical of the 14th century. Instead of focusing on a [[Meter (poetry)|metrical]] syllabic count and [[rhyme]], the [[Alliterative verse|alliterative form]] of this period usually relied on the agreement of a pair of stressed syllables at the beginning of the line and another pair at the end. Each line always includes a pause, called a ''[[caesura]]'', at some point after the first two stresses, dividing it into two half-lines. Although he largely follows the form of his day, the Gawain poet was somewhat freer with convention than his or her predecessors. The poet broke the alliterative lines into variable-length groups and ended these nominal stanzas with a rhyming section of five lines known as the ''[[bob and wheel]]'', in which the \"bob\" is a very short line, sometimes of only two syllables, followed by the \"wheel,\" longer lines with [[internal rhyme]].<ref name = norton />\n\n{{Clear}}\n<center>\n{| border=\"0\" cellpadding=\"1\"\n|+\n!

This story parallels ''Gawain'' in that, like the Green Knight, [[C\u00fa Chulainn]]'s antagonist feints three blows with the axe before letting his target depart without injury. A beheading exchange also appears in the late 12th-century ''[[Caradoc|Life of Caradoc]]'', a [[Middle French]] narrative embedded in the anonymous [[Perceval, the Story of the Grail#First Continuation|First Continuation]] of [[Chr\u00e9tien de Troyes]]' ''[[Perceval, the Story of the Grail]]''. A notable difference in this story is that Caradoc's challenger is his father in disguise, come to test his honour. [[Lancelot]] is given a beheading challenge in the early 13th-century ''[[Perlesvaus]]'', in which a knight begs him to chop off his head or else put his own in jeopardy. Lancelot reluctantly cuts it off, agreeing to come to the same place in a year to put his head in the same danger. When Lancelot arrives, the people of the town celebrate and announce that they have finally found a true knight, because many others had failed this test of chivalry.<ref name = Brewer/>\n\nThe stories ''The Girl with the Mule'' (alternately titled ''The Mule Without a Bridle'') and ''Hunbaut'' feature Gawain in beheading game situations. In ''Hunbaut,'' Gawain cuts off a man's head and, before he can replace it, removes the magic cloak keeping the man alive, thus killing him. Several stories tell of knights who struggle to stave off the advances of women sent by their lords as a test; these stories include ''Yder'', the [[Lancelot-Grail]], ''Hunbaut'', and ''The Knight of the Sword''. The last two involve Gawain specifically. Usually the temptress is the daughter or wife of a lord to whom the knight owes respect, and the knight is tested to see whether or not he will remain [[chaste]] in trying circumstances.<ref name = Brewer>Brewer, Elisabeth.

Brewer, 1992. {{ISBN|0-85991-359-7}}</ref>\n\nIn the first branch of the medieval Welsh collection of tales known as [[The Four Branches of the Mabinogi]], [[Pwyll]] exchanges places for a year with [[Arawn]], the lord of [[Annwn]] (the Otherworld). Despite having his appearance changed to resemble Arawn exactly, Pwyll does not have sexual relations with Arawn's wife during this time, thus establishing a lasting friendship between the two men. This story may, then, provide a background to Gawain's attempts to resist the wife of the Green Knight; thus, the story of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight may be seen as a tale which combines elements of the Celtic beheading game and seduction test stories. Additionally, in both stories a year passes before the completion of the conclusion of the challenge or exchange. Some scholars disagree with this interpretation, however, as Arawn seems to have accepted the notion that Pwyll may reciprocate with his wife, making it less of a \"seduction test\" per se, as seduction tests typically involve a Lord and Lady conspiring to seduce a knight, seemingly ''against'' the wishes of the Lord.<ref name =friedman>Friedman, Albert B. \"Morgan le Fay in Sir Gawain and the Green Knight.\" ''Speculum.''

The Turk then praises Gawain and showers him with gifts. ''[[The Carle of Carlisle]]'' (17th century) also resembles ''Gawain'' in a scene in which the Carle (Churl), a lord, takes Sir Gawain to a chamber where two swords are hanging and orders Gawain to cut off his head or suffer his own to be cut off.<ref>Hahn, Thomas. \"The Carle of Carlisle\", in ''Sir Gawain: Eleven Romances and Tales''.

(''God Speed!'' \u2013 [[Edmund Blair Leighton#List of works|Edmund Blair Leighton]] 1900)]]\nAt the heart of ''Sir Gawain and the Green Knight'' is the test of Gawain's adherence to the code of [[chivalry]]. The typical [[temptation]] [[fable]] of [[medieval literature]] presents a series of tribulations assembled as tests or \"proofs\" of moral [[virtue]]. The stories often describe several individuals' failures after which the main character is tested.<ref name=\"kittsix\">Kittredge, George Lyman. ''A Study of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight''. Harvard University Press, 1960. p.&nbsp;76. ASIN B0006AWBXS</ref> Success in the proofs will often bring immunity or good fortune. Gawain's ability to pass the tests of his host are of utmost importance to his survival, though he does not know it. It is only by fortuity or \"instinctive-courtesy\" that Sir Gawain is able to pass his test.<ref name=\"kitteight\">Kittredge, p.&nbsp;83</ref> Gawain does not realize, however, that these tests are all orchestrated by Sir Bertilak.<ref>\"Sir Gawain and the Green Knight\". ''Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, Pearl, Sir Orfeo''. Translated by J.\u00a0R.\u00a0R. Tolkien, New York: Ballantine Books, 1975. 92.</ref>\nIn addition to the laws of chivalry, Gawain must respect another set of laws concerning [[courtly love]]. The [[knight]]'s code of honour requires him to do whatever a [[wikt:damsel|damsel]] asks. Gawain must accept the girdle from the Lady, but he must also keep the promise he has made to his host that he will give whatever he gains that day. Gawain chooses to keep the girdle out of fear of death, thus breaking his promise to the host but honouring the lady. Upon learning that the Green Knight is actually his host (Bertilak), he realises that although he has completed his quest, he has failed to be virtuous. This test demonstrates the conflict between honour and knightly duties. In breaking his promise, Gawain believes he has lost his honour and failed in his duties.<ref>Burrow, J.\u00a0A. ''A Reading of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight''. London: Kegan Paul Ltd., 1965. p.&nbsp;162. {{ISBN|0-7100-8695-4}}</ref>\n\n===Hunting and seduction===\nScholars have frequently noted the parallels between the three hunting scenes and the three seduction scenes in ''Gawain''. They are generally agreed that the fox chase has significant parallels to the third seduction scene, in which Gawain accepts the girdle from Bertilak's wife. Gawain, like the fox, fears for his life and is looking for a way to avoid death from the Green Knight's axe. Like his counterpart, he resorts to trickery in order to save his skin. The fox uses tactics so unlike the first two animals, and so unexpectedly, that Bertilak has the hardest time hunting it. Similarly, Gawain finds the Lady's advances in the third seduction scene more unpredictable and challenging to resist than her previous attempts. She changes her evasive language, typical of [[courtly love]] relationships, to a more assertive style. Her dress, relatively modest in earlier scenes, is suddenly voluptuous and revealing.<ref name = Burnley>{{cite journal| last1 = Burnley| first1 = J.\u00a0D.| year = 1973| title = The Hunting Scenes in 'Sir Gawain and the Green Knight' \".| url =| journal = The Yearbook of English Studies| volume = 3| issue =| pages = 1\u20139| doi=10.2307/3506850| jstor = 3506850}}</ref>\n\nThe deer- and boar-hunting scenes are less clearly connected, although scholars have attempted to link each animal to Gawain's reactions in the parallel seduction scene. Attempts to connect the deer hunt with the first seduction scene have unearthed a few parallels. Deer hunts of the time, like courtship, had to be done according to established rules. Women often favoured suitors who hunted well and skinned their animals, sometimes even watching while a deer was cleaned.<ref name = Burnley/><ref>The \"hyndez\" (hinds) first described in the poem are probably from [[red deer]], a species with large antlers like the [[elk|American elk]], while the subsequent \"dos and of o\u00feer dere\" (does and other deer) likely refer to the smaller [[fallow deer]]. (Ong, Walter J. \"The Green Knight's Harts and Bucks\". ''Modern Language Notes''. (December 1950) 65.8 pp.&nbsp;536\u2013539.)</ref> The sequence describing the deer hunt is relatively unspecific and nonviolent, with an air of relaxation and exhilaration. The first seduction scene follows in a similar vein, with no overt physical advances and no apparent danger; the entire exchange is humorously portrayed.<ref name = Burnley/>\n\nThe boar-hunting scene is, in contrast, laden with detail. Boars were (and are) much more difficult to hunt than deer; approaching one with only a sword was akin to challenging a knight to single combat. In the hunting sequence, the boar flees but is cornered before a ravine. He turns to face Bertilak with his back to the ravine, prepared to fight. Bertilak dismounts and in the ensuing fight kills the boar. He removes its head and displays it on a pike. In the seduction scene, Bertilak's wife, like the boar, is more forward, insisting that Gawain has a romantic reputation and that he must not disappoint her. Gawain, however, is successful in parrying her attacks, saying that surely she knows more than he about love. Both the boar hunt and the seduction scene can be seen as depictions of a moral victory: both Gawain and Bertilak face struggles alone and emerge triumphant.<ref name = Burnley/>\nMasculinity has also been associated with hunting. The theme of masculinity is present throughout. In an article by Vern L. Bullough, \"Being a Male in the Middle Ages,\" he discusses Sir Gawain and how normally, masculinity is often viewed in terms of being sexually active. He notes that Sir Gawain is not part of this normalcy.\n\n===Nature and chivalry===\nSome argue that nature represents a chaotic, lawless order which is in direct confrontation with the civilisation of Camelot throughout ''Sir Gawain and the Green Knight''. The green horse and rider that first invade Arthur's peaceful halls are iconic representations of nature's disturbance.<ref>Cawley, A. C. 'Pearl, Sir Gawain and the Green Knight':\"...the Green Knight, ''alias'' Sir Bertilak, is an immensely vital person who is closely associated with the life of nature: his greenness, the birds and flies of his decorative embroidery, his beard as great as a bush, the holly branch in his hand, the energy he displays as a huntsman-all give him kinship with the physical world outside the castle.\"</ref> Nature is presented throughout the poem as rough and indifferent, constantly threatening the order of men and courtly life. Nature invades and disrupts order in the major events of the narrative, both symbolically and through the inner nature of humanity. This element appears first with the disruption caused by the Green Knight, later when Gawain must fight off his natural lust for Bertilak's wife, and again when Gawain breaks his vow to Bertilak by choosing to keep the green girdle, valuing survival over virtue. Represented by the [[sin]]-stained girdle, [[nature]] is an underlying force, forever within man and keeping him imperfect (in a chivalric sense).<ref name = woodsw>Woods, William F. \"Nature and the Inner Man in Sir Gawain and the Green Knight\". ''The Chaucer Review'', Vol. 36, No. 3, 2002, pp.&nbsp;209\u2013227.</ref> In this view, Gawain is part of a wider conflict between nature and chivalry, an examination of the ability of man's order to overcome the chaos of nature.<ref name = rhg>Green, Richard Hamilton. \"Gawain's Shield and the Quest for Perfection\". ''ELH''. (June 1962) 29.2 pp.&nbsp;121\u2013139.</ref>\n\nSeveral critics have made exactly the opposite interpretation, reading the poem as a comic critique of the Christianity of the time, particularly as embodied in the Christian chivalry of Arthur's court. In its zeal to extirpate all traces of paganism, Christianity had cut itself off from the sources of life in nature and the female. The green girdle represents all the pentangle lacks. The Arthurian enterprise is doomed unless it can acknowledge the unattainability of the ideals of the Round Table, and, for the sake of realism and wholeness, recognize and incorporate the pagan values represented by the Green Knight.<ref>This interpretation was first advanced by John Speirs in ''Scrutiny'', vol.\u00a0XVI, iv, 1949 (incorporated in his ''Medieval English Poetry: The Non-Chaucerian Tradition'', rev.\u00a0ed. 1962. Similar interpretations were later offered by Francis Berry in ''The Pelican Guide to English Literature: The Age of Chaucer'', 1954; Goldhurst, \"The Green and the Gold: The Major Theme of ''Sit Gawain and the Green Knight'', ''College English'', Nov. 1958; A.C, Spearing, ''The Gawain-Poet: A Critical Study'', 1970; W. A. Davenport, ''The Art of the Gawain-Poet'', 1978; J. Tambling, \"A More Powerful Life: ''Sir Gawain and the Green Knight''\", ''Haltwhistle Quarterly'' 9, 1981; and K. Sagar, \"Sir Gawain and the Green Girdle\", in his ''Literature and the Crime Against Nature'', 2005.</ref>\n\nThe chivalry that is represented within 'Gawain' is one which was constructed by court nobility. The violence that is part of this chivalry is steeply contrasted by the fact that King Arthur's court is Christian and the initial beheading event takes place while celebrating Christmas. The violence of an act of beheading seems to be counterintuitive to chivalric and Christian ideals, and yet it is seen as part of knighthood.<ref>{{cite journal| last1 = Martin| first1 = Carl Grey| year = 2009| title = The Cipher of Chivalry: Violence as Courtly Play in the World of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight| url =| journal = The Chaucer Review| volume = 43| issue = 3| pages = 311\u201329| jstor=25642113}}</ref>\n\nThe question of politeness and chivalry is a main theme during Gawain's interactions with Bertilak's wife. He cannot accept her advances or else lose his honour, and yet he cannot utterly refuse her advances or else risk upsetting his hostess. Gawain plays a very fine line and the only part where he appears to fail is when he conceals the green girdle from Bertilak.<ref>{{cite journal| last1 = Jucker| first1 = Andreas H.| year = 2015| title = Courtesy and Politness in Sir Gawain and the Green Knight| url =| journal = Studia Anglica Posnaniensia| volume = 43| issue = 3| pages = 5\u201328| doi=10.1515/stap-2015-0007| doi-access = free}}</ref>\n\n===Games===\nThe word ''gomen'' (game) is found 18 times in ''Gawain''. Its similarity to the word ''gome'' (man), which appears 21 times, has led some scholars to see men and games as centrally linked. Games at this time were seen as tests of worthiness, as when the Green Knight challenges the court's right to its good name in a \"Christmas game\".<ref name = game /> The \"game\" of exchanging gifts was common in Germanic cultures.

These appear at first to be unconnected. However, a victory in the first game will lead to a victory in the second.

ASIN B000IPU84U</ref>\n\n===Times and seasons===\nTimes, dates, seasons, and cycles within ''Gawain'' are often noted by scholars because of their symbolic nature. The story starts on New Year's Eve with a beheading and culminates on the next New Year's Day. Gawain leaves Camelot on [[All Saints Day]] and arrives at Bertilak's castle on Christmas Eve. Furthermore, the Green Knight tells Gawain to meet him at the Green Chapel in \"a year and a day\"\u2014a period of time seen often in medieval literature.<ref name = year>For reasons not entirely understood, the Celts used the phrase \"a year and a day\", to refer to exactly one year. See for example W. J. McGee's \"The Beginning of Mathematics.\" ''American Anthropologist.'' (Oct 1899) Vol. 1 Iss. 4 pp.&nbsp;646\u2013674.</ref> Some scholars interpret the yearly cycles, each beginning and ending in winter, as the poet's attempt to convey the inevitable fall of all things good and noble in the world. Such a theme is strengthened by the image of [[Trojan War|Troy]], a powerful nation once thought to be invincible which, according to the ''[[Aeneid]]'', fell to the Greeks due to pride and ignorance. The Trojan connection shows itself in the presence of two virtually identical descriptions of Troy's destruction. The poem's first line reads: \"Since the siege and the assault were ceased at Troy\" and the final stanzaic line (before the bob and wheel) is \"After the siege and the assault were ceased at Troy\".<ref name = christian>{{cite journal| last1 = Clark| first1 = S.

In [[English folklore]] and literature, green was traditionally used to symbolise nature and its associated attributes: fertility and rebirth. Stories of the medieval period also used it to allude to love and the base desires of man.<ref>Chamberlin, Vernon A. \"Symbolic Green: A Time-Honored Characterizing Device in Spanish Literature\".

British medievalist [[C. S. Lewis]] said the character was \"as vivid and concrete as any image in literature\" and [[J. R. R. Tolkien]] said he was the \"most difficult character\" to interpret in ''Sir Gawain''. His major role in Arthurian literature is that of a judge and tester of knights, thus he is at once terrifying, friendly, and mysterious.<ref name = knight/> He appears in only two other poems: ''The Greene Knight'' and ''King Arthur and King Cornwall''.<ref>Hahn, Thomas. \"The Greene Knight\".

In the Death of Curoi (one of the Irish stories from Bricriu's Feast), Curoi stands in for Bertilak, and is often called \"the man of the grey mantle\". Though the words usually used for grey in the Death of Curoi are ''lachtna'' or ''odar'', roughly meaning milk-coloured and shadowy respectively, in later works featuring a green knight, the word ''glas'' is used and may have been the basis of misunderstanding.<ref>{{Cite journal|first=Alice|last=Buchanan|title=The Irish Framework of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight|journal=PLMA|volume=47|issue= 2|date=June 1932|pages=315\u2013338|doi=10.2307/457878|jstor=457878}}</ref>\n\n===Girdle===\n\n{{See also|Girdle#Girdle in literature|l1=Girdle in literature}}\n[[Image:John William Waterhouse - The Lady of Shalott - Google Art Project edit.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Another famous Arthurian woman, [[The Lady of Shalott]], with a medieval [[girdle]] around her waist ([[John William Waterhouse]], 1888)]]\nThe girdle's symbolic meaning, in ''Sir Gawain and the Green Knight'', has been construed in a variety of ways. Interpretations range from sexual to spiritual. Those who argue for the sexual inference view the girdle as a \"trophy\".<ref>. Friedman, Albert B. Morgan le Fay in Sir Gawain and the Green Knight. Medieval Academy of America. Speculum, Vol. 35, No. 2, 1960</ref> It is not entirely clear if the \"winner\" is Sir Gawain or Lady Bertilak. The girdle is given to Gawain by Lady Bertilak to keep him safe when he confronts the Green Knight. When Lord Bertilak comes home from his hunting trip, Gawain does not reveal the girdle to his host, instead he hides it. This introduces the spiritual interpretation, that Gawain's acceptance of the girdle is a sign of his faltering faith in God, at least in the face of death.<ref>Berger, Sidney E. \"Gawain's Departure from the Peregrinatio\". Morgantown: West Virginia University Press, 1985.</ref> To some, the Green Knight is Christ, who overcomes death, while Gawain is the Every Christian, who in his struggles to follow Christ faithfully, chooses the easier path. In ''Sir Gawain'', the easier choice is the girdle, which promises what Gawain most desires. Faith in God, alternatively, requires one's acceptance that what one most desires does not always coincide with what God has planned. It is arguably best to view the girdle not as an either\u2013or situation, but as a complex, multi-faceted symbol that acts to test Gawain in more ways than one.  While Gawain is able to resist Bertilak's wife's sexual advances, he is unable to resist the powers of the girdle. Gawain is operating under the laws of chivalry which, evidently, have rules that can contradict each other. In the story of ''Sir Gawain'', Gawain finds himself torn between doing what a damsel asks (accepting the girdle) and keeping his promise (returning anything given to him while his host is away).<ref>Burrow, J.\u00a0A. A Reading of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight. London: Kegan Paul Ltd., 1965</ref> \n{{Clear}}\n\n===Pentangle===\n{{See also|Pentagram}}\nThe poem contains the first recorded use of the word ''pentangle'' in English.<ref>(''Oxford English Dictionary Online'').</ref> It contains the only representation of such a symbol on Gawain's shield in the Gawain literature. What is more, the poet uses a total of 46 lines in order to describe the meaning of the pentangle; no other symbol in the poem receives as much attention or is described in such detail.<ref>Arthur, Ross G. ''Medieval Sign Theory and Sir Gawain and the Green Knight''. Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 1987. pp.&nbsp;22, 26. {{ISBN|0-8020-5717-9}}</ref> The poem describes the pentangle as a symbol of faithfulness and an \"endless knot\". From lines 640 to 654, the five points of the pentangle relate directly to Gawain in five ways: five senses, his five fingers, his faith found in the [[five wounds of Christ]], the five joys of [[Holy Mary|Mary]] (whose face was on the inside of the shield) and finally friendship, fraternity, purity, politeness and pity (traits that Gawain possessed around others). In line 625, it is described as \"a sign by Solomon\". [[Solomon]], the third king of [[Israel]], in the 10th century BC, was said to have the mark of the pentagram on his ring, which he received from the [[archangel]] [[Michael (archangel)|Michael]]. The pentagram seal on this ring was said to give Solomon power over [[demons]].<ref>LaBossi\u00e8re, Camille R., and [[Jerry Gladson|Gladson, Jerry A.]] \"Solomon\", in ''A Dictionary of Biblical Tradition in English Literature''. Grand Rapids, Michigan: William B. Eerdmans Publishing Company, 1992 p.&nbsp;722.</ref>\n\nAlong these lines, some academics link the Gawain pentangle to magical traditions. In Germany, the symbol was called a ''Drudenfu\u00df'' and was placed on household objects to keep out evil.<ref name = Hulbert>Hulbert, J. R. \"Syr Gawayn and the Grene Knyzt (Concluded)\". ''Modern Philology''. (April 1916) 13.12 pp.&nbsp;689\u2013730.</ref> The symbol was also associated with magical charms that, if recited or written on a weapon, would call forth magical forces. However, concrete evidence tying the magical pentagram to Gawain's pentangle is scarce.<ref name = Hulbert/><ref>Jackson, I. \"Sir Gawain's Coat of Arms.\" ''The Modern Language Review''. (January 1920) 15.1 pp.&nbsp;77\u201379.</ref>\n\nGawain's pentangle also symbolises the \"phenomenon of physically endless objects signifying a temporally endless quality.\"<ref>Arthur, pp.&nbsp;33\u201334.</ref> Many poets use the symbol of the circle to show infinity or endlessness, but Gawain's poet insisted on using something more complex. In medieval number theory, the number five is considered a \"circular number\", since it \"reproduces itself in its last digit when raised to its powers\".<ref name=\"rossfour\">Arthur, p.&nbsp;34.</ref> Furthermore, it replicates itself geometrically; that is, every pentangle has a smaller pentagon that allows a pentangle to be embedded in it and this \"process may be repeated forever with decreasing pentangles\".<ref name=\"rossfour\"/> Thus, by reproducing the number five, which in medieval number symbolism signified incorruptibility, Gawain's pentangle represents his eternal incorruptibility.<ref>Arthur, p.&nbsp;35.</ref>\n\n===The Lady's Ring===\nGawain's refusal of the Lady Bertilak's ring has major implications for the remainder of the story. While the modern student may tend to pay more attention to the girdle as the eminent object offered by the lady, readers in the time of Gawain would have noticed the significance of the offer of the ring as they believed that rings, and especially the embedded gems, had talismanic properties similarly done by the Gawain-poet in ''Pearl''.<ref name=\"cooke\">{{Cite journal|last=Cooke|first=Jessica|year=1998|title=The Lady's 'Blushing' Ring in ''Sir Gawain and the Green Knight''|journal=[[The Review of English Studies]]|volume=49|issue=193|pages=1\u20138|doi=10.1093/res/49.193.1}}</ref> This is especially true of the lady's ring as scholars believe it to be a [[ruby]] or carbuncle, indicated when the Gawain-Poet describes it as a \"brygt sunne\" (line 1819),<ref>{{Cite book|last=Andrew|first=Malcolm|author2=Ronald Waldron|title=The Poems of the Pearl Manuscript|publisher=University of Exeter Press|location=Exeter|year=1996|page=[https://archive.org/details/poemsofpearlmanu0000brit_r3l6/page/273 273]|isbn=0-85989-514-9|url=https://archive.org/details/poemsofpearlmanu0000brit_r3l6/page/273}}</ref> a \"fiery sun.\"<ref>{{Cite book|last=Borroff|first=Marie|title=Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, Patience, Pearl: Verse Translations|publisher=Norton|location=New York|year=2001|page=[https://archive.org/details/sirgawaingreenkn00mari/page/58 58]|isbn=978-0-393-97658-8|url=https://archive.org/details/sirgawaingreenkn00mari/page/58}}</ref> This red colour can be seen as symbolizing royalty, divinity, and the Passion of the Christ, something that Gawain as a knight of the Round Table would strive for,<ref>Cooke, \"The Lady's 'Blushing,'\" 3.</ref> but this colour could also represent the negative qualities of temptation and covetousness.<ref>Cooke, \"The Lady's 'Blushing,'\" 4.</ref> Given the importance of magic rings in [[Arthurian romance]], this remarkable ring would also have been believed to protect the wearer from harm just as Lady Bertilak claims the girdle will.<ref>Cooke, \"The Lady's 'Blushing,'\" 2,5,7.</ref>\n\n===Numbers===\nThe poet highlights number symbolism to add symmetry and meaning to the poem. For example, three kisses are exchanged between Gawain and Bertilak's wife; Gawain is tempted by her on three separate days; Bertilak goes hunting three times, and the Green Knight swings at Gawain three times with his axe. The number two also appears repeatedly, as in the two beheading scenes, two confession scenes, and two castles.<ref>Howard, Donald R. \"Structure and Symmetry in Sir Gawain\". ''Speculum''. (July 1964) 39.3 pp.&nbsp;425\u2013433.</ref> The five points of the pentangle, the poet adds, represent Gawain's virtues, for he is \"faithful five ways and five times each\".<ref>''Sir Gawain and the Green Knight'', Book 2, Stanza 27.</ref> The poet goes on to list the ways in which Gawain is virtuous: all five of his senses are without fault; his five fingers never fail him, and he always remembers the [[Rosary#Sorrowful Mysteries|five wounds of Christ]], as well as the [[Rosary#Joyful Mysteries|five joys]] of the [[Virgin Mary]]. The fifth five is Gawain himself, who embodies the five moral virtues of the code of [[chivalry]]: \"[[friendship]], [[generosity]], [[chastity]], [[courtesy]], and [[piety]]\".<ref>Kittredge, p.&nbsp;93.</ref> All of these virtues reside, as the poet says, in the \"Endless Knot\" of the pentangle, which forever interlinks and is never broken.<ref>''Sir Gawain and the Green Knight'', Book 2, Stanza 28.</ref> This intimate relationship between symbol and faith allows for rigorous allegorical interpretation, especially in the physical role that the shield plays in Gawain's quest.<ref>Mills, M. \"Christian Significance and Roman Tradition in Sir Gawain and the Green Knight.\" Critical Studies of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight. Eds. Donald R. Howard & Christian Zacher. 2nd ed. Notre Dame, Indiana: University of Notre Dame Press, 1970. 85\u2013105.</ref> Thus, the poet makes Gawain the epitome of perfection in [[knighthood]] through number symbolism.<ref name =stanza/>\n<!-- Scholars believe that the poet uses this symbol of fives not only to give insight into the virtues of Gawain, but also to set the stage for the remainder of the poem. Through the five points of the pentangle the reader is presented with the five dilemmas of Sir Gawain. The Green Knight's challenge is the first: known for his valour and courtesy, Gawain would damage his reputation by refusing it. In accepting the challenge of the Green Knight, Gawain enters into his second dilemma. He must escape with both his life and honour intact.<ref>Engelhardt, George J. \"The Predicament of Gawain.\" ''Modern Language Quarterly''. (Sep 1955) 16.3 p.&nbsp;61.</ref> Gawain enters into a bargain with Bertilak which leads to his third dilemma: \"Whatever I win in the woods I will give you at eve, and all you have earned you must offer to me.\"<ref>''Sir Gawain and the Green Knight'', lines&nbsp;1105\u201308.</ref> With a \"gift of body\",<ref>Engelhardt, George J. \"The Predicament of Gawain.\" ''Modern Language Quarterly''. (Sep 1955) 16.3 p.&nbsp;62.</ref> Gawain is tempted by Bertilak's wife. He cannot exchange this gift with Bertilak, nor can he, a knight of renowned courtesy, refuse it. Gawain must refuse the lady\u2019s attempts at [[seduction]], yet he must do so courteously; this dilemma is his fourth. Gawain encounters his fifth dilemma when he accepts the gift of the girdle. He agrees to hide it from Bertilak, yet his bargain with the lord requires him to exchange it. -->\n\nThe number five is also found in the structure of the poem itself. ''Sir Gawain'' is 101&nbsp;stanzas long, traditionally organised into four 'Fits' of 21, 24, 34, and 22&nbsp;stanzas. These divisions, however, have since been disputed; scholars have begun to believe that they are the work of the copyist and not of the poet. The surviving manuscript features a series of capital letters added after the fact by another scribe, and some scholars argue that these additions were an attempt to restore the original divisions. These letters divide the manuscript into nine parts. The first and last parts are 22&nbsp;stanzas long. The second and second-to-last parts are only one stanza long, and the middle five parts are eleven stanzas long. The number eleven is associated with transgression in other medieval literature (being one more than ten, a number associated with the [[Ten Commandments]]). Thus, this set of five elevens (55 stanzas) creates the perfect mix of transgression and incorruption, suggesting that Gawain is faultless in his faults.<ref name =stanza>Robertson, Michael. \"Stanzaic Symmetry in Sir Gawain and the Green Knight\". ''Speculum''. (October 1982) 57.4 pp.&nbsp;779\u2013785.</ref>\n\n===Wounds===\nAt the story's climax, Gawain is wounded superficially in the neck by the Green Knight's axe. During the medieval period, the body and the soul were believed to be so intimately connected that wounds were considered an outward sign of inward sin. The neck, specifically, was believed to correlate with the part of the soul related to [[Will (philosophy)|will]], connecting the reasoning part (the head) and the courageous part (the heart). Gawain's sin resulted from using his will to separate reasoning from courage. By accepting the girdle from the lady, he employs reason to do something less than courageous\u2014evade death in a dishonest way. Gawain's wound is thus an outward sign of an internal wound. The Green Knight's series of tests shows Gawain the weakness that has been in him all along: the desire to use his will pridefully for personal gain, rather than submitting his will in humility to God. The Green Knight, by engaging with the greatest knight of Camelot, also reveals the moral weakness of pride in all of Camelot, and therefore all of humanity. However, the wounds of Christ, believed to offer healing to wounded souls and bodies, are mentioned throughout the poem in the hope that this sin of prideful \"stiffneckedness\" will be healed among fallen mortals.<ref>{{Cite journal|doi=10.2307/462158|last=Reichardt|first=Paul F.|year=1984|title=Gawain and the Image of the Wound|journal=PMLA|volume=99|issue=2|pages=154\u201361|jstor=462158}}</ref><ref>Arthur, pp.&nbsp;121\u2013123.</ref>\n\n==Interpretations==\n\n=== ''Gawain'' as medieval romance ===\n{{Further|Order of the Garter|Romance (heroic literature)}}\n[[Image:Pettie, The Vigil.jpg|thumb|right|Gawain represented the perfect knight, as a fighter, a lover, and a religious devotee. (''The Vigil'' by [[John Pettie]], 1884)]]\nMany critics argue that ''Sir Gawain and the Green Knight'' should be viewed, above all, as a [[Romance (heroic literature)|romance]]. Medieval romances typically recount the marvellous adventures of a chivalrous, [[hero]]ic [[knight]], often of super-human ability, who abides by chivalry's strict codes of honour and demeanour, embarks upon a [[quest]] and defeats monsters, thereby winning the favour of a [[princesse lointaine|lady]]. Thus, medieval romances focus not on love and sentiment (as the term \"romance\" implies today), but on [[adventure novel|adventure]].<ref>Frye, Northrop. ''[[Anatomy of Criticism]]'', p.&nbsp;186. {{ISBN|0-691-01298-9}}</ref>\n\nGawain's function, as medieval scholar Alan Markman says, \"is the function of the romance hero&nbsp;\u2026 to stand as the champion of the human race, and by submitting to strange and severe tests, to demonstrate human capabilities for good or bad action.\"<ref name = markman/> Through Gawain's adventure, it becomes clear that he is merely human. The reader becomes attached to this human view in the midst of the poem's romanticism, relating to Gawain's humanity while respecting his knightly qualities. Gawain \"shows us what moral conduct is. We shall probably not equal his behaviour, but we admire him for pointing out the way.\"<ref name = markman>Markman, Alan M. \"The Meaning of Sir Gawain and the Green Knight\". ''PMLA''. (September 1957) 72.4 pp.&nbsp;574\u2013586</ref>\n\nIn viewing the poem as a medieval romance, many scholars see it as intertwining chivalric and [[courtly love]] laws under the English [[Order of the Garter]]. The group's motto, 'honi soit qui mal y pense', or \"Shamed be he who finds evil here,\" is written at the end of the poem. Some critics describe Gawain's peers wearing girdles of their own as evidence of the origin of the Order of the Garter. However, in the parallel poem ''[[The Greene Knight]]'', the lace is white, not green, and is considered the origin of the collar worn by the knights of the Bath, not the Order of the Garter.<ref>''Sir Gawain and the Green Knight'', second edition.

Still, the connection made by the copyist to the Order is not extraordinary.<ref>''The Norton Anthology of English Literature'', eighth edition, Vol. BEd Stephen Greenblatt. New York, London: W. W. Norton and Co., 2006, p.&nbsp;213 (footnote). {{ISBN|0-393-92833-0}}</ref>\n\n===Christian interpretations===\n[[Image:Adam-und-Eva-1513.jpg|thumb|Scholars have pointed out parallels between the girdle Bertilak's wife offers Gawain, and the fruit [[Eve]] offered to [[Adam]] in the Biblical [[Garden of Eden]]. (''Adam and Eve'' [[Lucas Cranach the Elder|Lucas Cranach]], ca. 1513)]]\n\nThe poem is in many ways deeply Christian, with frequent references to the fall of Adam and Eve and to Jesus Christ. Scholars have debated the depth of the Christian elements within the poem by looking at it in the context of the age in which it was written, coming up with varying views as to what represents a Christian element of the poem and what does not. For example, some critics compare ''Sir Gawain'' to the other three poems of the ''Gawain'' manuscript. Each has a heavily Christian theme, causing scholars to interpret ''Gawain'' similarly. Comparing it to the poem ''[[Cleanness]]'' (also known as ''Purity''), for example, they see it as a story of the [[Apocalyptic literature|apocalyptic]] fall of a civilisation, in ''Gawain's'' case, Camelot. In this interpretation, Sir Gawain is like [[Noah]], separated from his society and warned by the Green Knight (who is seen as God's representative) of the coming doom of Camelot. Gawain, judged worthy through his test, is spared the doom of the rest of Camelot. King Arthur and his knights, however, misunderstand Gawain's experience and wear garters themselves. In ''Cleanness'' the men who are saved are similarly helpless in warning their society of impending destruction.<ref name = christian/>\n\nOne of the key points stressed in this interpretation is that salvation is an individual experience difficult to communicate to outsiders. In his depiction of Camelot, the poet reveals a concern for his society, whose inevitable fall will bring about the ultimate destruction intended by God. ''Gawain'' was written around the time of the [[Black Death]] and [[English peasants' revolt of 1381|Peasants' Revolt]], events which convinced many people that their world was coming to an apocalyptic end and this belief was reflected in literature and culture.<ref name = christian/> However, other critics see weaknesses in this view, since the Green Knight is ultimately under the control of Morgan le Fay, often viewed as a figure of evil in Camelot tales. This makes the knight's presence as a representative of God problematic.<ref name = game>Goodlad, Lauren M.

Lawrence Besserman, a specialist in medieval literature, explains that \"the Green Knight is not a figurative representative of Christ. But the idea of Christ's divine/human nature provides a medieval conceptual framework that supports the poet's serious/comic account of the Green Knight's supernatural/human qualities and actions.\" This duality exemplifies the influence and importance of Christian teachings and views of Christ in the era of the Gawain Poet.<ref name = knight/>\n\nFurthermore, critics note the Christian reference to Christ's crown of thorns at the conclusion of ''Sir Gawain and the Green Knight''. After Gawain returns to Camelot and tells his story regarding the newly acquired green sash, the poem concludes with a brief prayer and a reference to \"the thorn-crowned God\".<ref>''Sir Gawain and the Green Knight'', line 2529.</ref> Besserman theorises that \"with these final words the poet redirects our attention from the circular girdle-turned-sash (a double image of Gawain's \"yntrawpe/renoun\") to the circular Crown of Thorns (a double image of Christ's humiliation turned triumph).\"<ref name = knight/>\n\nThroughout the poem, Gawain encounters numerous trials testing his devotion and faith in Christianity. When Gawain sets out on his journey to find the Green Chapel, he finds himself lost, and only after praying to the [[Virgin Mary]] does he find his way. As he continues his journey, Gawain once again faces anguish regarding his inevitable encounter with the Green Knight. Instead of praying to Mary, as before, Gawain places his faith in the girdle given to him by Bertilak's wife. From the Christian perspective, this leads to disastrous and embarrassing consequences for Gawain as he is forced to reevaluate his faith when the Green Knight points out his betrayal.<ref name=\"cox\">Cox, Catherine.

The Gawain poet uses a [[English Midlands|North West Midlands]] dialect common on the Welsh\u2013English border, potentially placing him in the midst of this conflict. Patricia Clare Ingham is credited with first viewing the poem through the lens of [[postcolonialism]], and since then a great deal of dispute has emerged over the extent to which colonial differences play a role in the poem. Most critics agree that gender plays a role, but differ about whether gender supports the colonial ideals or replaces them as English and Welsh cultures interact in the poem.<ref name = arner>{{cite journal| last1 = Arner| first1 = Lynn| year = Summer 2006| title = The Ends of Enchantment: Colonialism and Sir Gawain and the Green Knight| url =| journal = Texas Studies in Literature and Language| volume = 48| issue = 2| pages = 79\u2013101| doi=10.1353/tsl.2006.0006}}</ref>\n\nA large amount of critical debate also surrounds the poem as it relates to the bi-cultural political landscape of the time. Some argue that Bertilak is an example of the hybrid Anglo-Welsh culture found on the Welsh\u2013English border. They therefore view the poem as a reflection of a hybrid culture that plays strong cultures off one another to create a new set of cultural rules and traditions. Other scholars, however, argue that historically much Welsh blood was shed well into the 14th century, creating a situation far removed from the more friendly hybridisation suggested by Ingham. To support this argument further, it is suggested that the poem creates an \"us versus them\" scenario contrasting the knowledgeable civilised English with the uncivilised borderlands that are home to Bertilak and the other monsters that Gawain encounters.<ref name=\"arner\" />\n\nIn contrast to this perception of the colonial lands, others argue that the land of Hautdesert, Bertilak's territory, has been misrepresented or ignored in modern criticism. They suggest that it is a land with its own moral agency, one that plays a central role in the story. Bonnie Lander, for example, argues that the denizens of Hautdesert are \"intelligently immoral\", choosing to follow certain codes and rejecting others, a position which creates a \"distinction&nbsp;\u2026 of moral insight versus moral faith\". Lander thinks that the border dwellers are more sophisticated because they do not unthinkingly embrace the chivalric codes but challenge them in a philosophical, and\u2014in the case of Bertilak's appearance at Arthur's court\u2014literal sense. Lander's argument about the superiority of the denizens of Hautdesert hinges on the lack of self-awareness present in Camelot, which leads to an unthinking populace that frowns on individualism. In this view, it is not Bertilak and his people, but Arthur and his court, who are the monsters.<ref name = lander>{{cite journal| last1 = Lander| first1 = Bonnie| year = 2007| title = The Convention of Innocence and Sir Gawain and the Green Knight's Literary Sophisticates| url =| journal = Parergon| volume = 24| issue = 1| pages = 41\u201366| doi=10.1353/pgn.2007.0046}}</ref>\n\n===Gawain's journey===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Hollywell.jpg|thumb|[[Saint Winifred|St. Winifred's]] well in [[Holywell, Flintshire|Holywell, Wales|]], Wales, possibly one of Gawain's stopping points on the way to the Green Chapel]] -->\nSeveral scholars have attempted to find a real-world correspondence for Gawain's journey to the Green Chapel.

They exist today as a single island off the coast of Wales.<ref>{{cite web| last =Twomey| first =Michael| authorlink =| title =Anglesey and North Wales| work =Travels With Sir Gawain| publisher =Ithaca Univ| url =http://www.ithaca.edu/faculty/twomey/travels/sggk_frameset.htm| doi =| accessdate =2007-06-21 }}</ref> In line 700, Gawain is said to pass the \"Holy Head\", believed by many scholars to be either [[Holywell, Flintshire|Holywell]] or the [[Cistercians|Cistercian]] abbey of Poulton in [[Pulford]]. Holywell is associated with the beheading of [[Winefride|Saint Winifred]]. As the story goes, Winifred was a virgin who was beheaded by a local leader after she refused his sexual advances. Her uncle, another saint, put her head back in place and healed the wound, leaving only a white scar.

Zeikowitz argues that the narrator of the poem seems entranced by the Knight's beauty, homoeroticising him in poetic form. The Green Knight's attractiveness challenges the homosocial rules of King Arthur's court and poses a threat to their way of life. Zeikowitz also states that Gawain seems to find Bertilak as attractive as the narrator finds the Green Knight. Bertilak, however, follows the homosocial code and develops a friendship with Gawain. Gawain's embracing and kissing Bertilak in several scenes thus represents not a homosexual but a homosocial expression. Men of the time often embraced and kissed and this was acceptable under the chivalric code. Nonetheless, the Green Knight blurs the lines between homosociality and homosexuality, representing the difficulty medieval writers sometimes had in separating the two.<ref>Zeikowitz, Richard E. \"Befriending the Medieval Queer: A Pedagogy for Literature Classes.\" ''College English: Special Issue: Lesbian and Gay Studies/Queer Pedagogies.'' Vol. 65 No. 1  (Sep 2002) pp. 67\u201380</ref>\n\n[[Carolyn Dinshaw]] argues that the poem may have been a response to accusations that [[Richard II of England|Richard II]] had a male lover\u2014an attempt to reestablish the idea that heterosexuality was the Christian norm. Around the time the poem was written, the Catholic Church was beginning to express concerns about kissing between males. Many religious figures were trying to make the distinction between strong trust and friendship between males and homosexuality. Still, the Pearl Poet seems to have been simultaneously entranced and repulsed by homosexual desire. In his other poem ''Cleanness'', he points out several grievous sins, but spends lengthy passages describing them in minute detail. His obsession seems to carry into ''Gawain'' in his descriptions of the Green Knight.<ref name=\"dinshaw1994\">Dinshaw, Carolyn. \"A Kiss Is Just a Kiss: Heterosexuality and Its Consolations in Sir Gawain and the Green Knight.\" ''Diacritics''. Vol. 24 No. 2/3 (Summer 1994) pp. 204\u2013226</ref>\n\nBeyond this, Dinshaw proposes that Gawain can be read as a woman-like figure. He is the passive one in the advances of Lady Bertilak, as well as in his encounters with Lord Bertilak, where he acts the part of a woman in kissing the man. However, while the poem does have homosexual elements, these elements are brought up by the poet in order to establish heterosexuality as the normal lifestyle of Gawain's world. The poem does this by making the kisses between Lady Bertilak and Gawain sexual in nature, but rendering the kisses between Gawain and Lord Bertilak \"unintelligible\" to the medieval reader. In other words, the poet portrays kisses between a man and a woman as having the possibility of leading to sex, while in a heterosexual world kisses between a man and a man are portrayed as having no such possibility.<ref name=dinshaw1994/>\n\n==Modern adaptations==\n\n=== Books ===\nThough the surviving manuscript dates from the fourteenth century, the first published version of the poem did not appear until as late as 1839, when [[Sir Frederic Madden]] of the British Museum recognized the poem as worth reading.<ref name=manus>Sir Gawain and the Green Knight, ed.

pa\u0144stwa|Chief of State]] (1918\u201322) and [[Marshal of Poland|First Marshal]] of [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]] (from 1920). He was considered the ''de facto'' leader (1926\u201335) of the Second Polish Republic as the [[Ministry of National Defence (Poland)|Minister of Military Affairs]]. After World War I, he held great power in [[Politics of Poland|Polish politics]] and was a distinguished figure on the international scene.{{sfn|Plach|2006|p=14}} He is viewed as a father of the Second Polish Republic re-established in 1918, 123 years after the final [[Partitions of Poland|Partition of Poland]] by [[Austria-Hungary|Austria]], [[Prussia]] and [[Russian Empire|Russia]] in 1795.{{r|DroSzwa95_911|Lieven94_159}}{{sfn|Lerski|1996|loc=[https://books.google.com/?id=QTUTqE2difgC&pg=PA441 p. 441]}}{{sfn|Held|1992|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=5O5NkwX-NnYC&pg=PA249 p. 249]}}\n\nSeeing himself as a descendant of the culture and traditions of the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]],{{r|Davies05_10}} Pi\u0142sudski believed in a multi-ethnic Poland\u2014\"a home of nations\" including indigenous ethnic and religious minorities he hoped would establish a robust union with the independent states of [[Lithuania]] and [[Ukraine]].{{r|Davies05_10}} His principal political antagonist, [[Roman Dmowski]], leader of the [[National Democrats (Poland)|National Democrat party]], by contrast, called for a Poland limited to the pre-Partitions [[Kingdom of Poland (1025\u20131385)|Polish Crown]] and based mainly on a homogeneous ethnically Polish population and [[Catholicism|Roman Catholic]] identity.\n\nEarly in his political career, Pi\u0142sudski became a leader of the [[Polish Socialist Party]].  Believing Poland's independence would be won militarily, he formed the [[Polish Legions in World War I|Polish Legions]].  In 1914, he predicted a new major war would defeat the [[Russian Empire]] and the [[Central Powers]].{{r|Roos+Rothschild}}  After [[World War I]] began in 1914, Pi\u0142sudski's Legions fought alongside [[Austria-Hungary]] against Russia.  In 1917, with [[Imperial Russia|Imperialist Russia]] faring poorly in the war, he withdrew his support for the Central Powers, and was imprisoned in [[Magdeburg]] by the Germans.\n\nFrom November 1918, when Poland regained its independence, until 1922, Pi\u0142sudski was Poland's [[Naczelnik Pa\u0144stwa|Chief of State]]. In 1919\u201321 he commanded Polish forces in six border wars that re-defined the country's borders.  On the verge of defeat in the [[Polish\u2013Soviet War]] his forces, in the August 1920 [[Battle of Warsaw (1920)|Battle of Warsaw]], threw back the invading Soviet Russians.  In 1923, with the government dominated by his opponents, in particular the [[National Democracy|National Democrats]], Pi\u0142sudski retired from active politics. Three years later he returned to power in the [[May Coup (Poland)|May 1926 ''coup d'\u00e9tat'']] and became Poland's [[Strongman (politics)|strongman]]. From then on until his death in 1935, he concerned himself primarily with military and foreign affairs. It was during this period that he developed a [[J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski's cult of personality|cult of personality]] that has survived into the 21st century.\n\nIn international affairs, Pi\u0142sudski pursued two complementary strategies meant to secure Poland's independence and enhance national security: \"[[Prometheism]]\", aimed at achieving the disintegration of [[Imperial Russia]] and later the [[Soviet Union]] into their constituent nations; and the creation of an [[Intermarium]] federation of [[Central and Eastern Europe]] and states between the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] and [[Black Sea]]s, to secure its peoples against [[Western Europe|Western]] and Eastern European [[imperialism]]s.{{sfn|Davies|2005|loc=[https://books.google.ca/books?id=9Tbed6iMNLEC&pg=PA55 55]}}\n\nHistorian [[Piotr S. Wandycz|Piotr Wandycz]] characterizes Pi\u0142sudski as \"an ardent Polish patriot who on occasion would castigate the Poles for their stupidity, cowardice, or servility. He described himself as a [[Polish-Lithuanian identity|Polish-Lithuanian]], and was stubborn and reserved, loath to show his emotions.\"{{sfn|Wandycz|1990|p=452}} Some aspects of Pi\u0142sudski's administration, such as establishing [[Bereza Kartuska prison]], remain controversial. Yet, he is highly-esteemed in Polish memory, and is regarded, together with his chief antagonist [[Roman Dmowski]], as a founder of the modern independent Poland.\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Piludski w szkole.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Pi\u0142sudski as a schoolboy]]\nHe was born 5 December 1867 to the [[szlachta|noble]] [[Pi\u0142sudski family|family Pi\u0142sudski]], at their manor near the village of [[Zu\u0142\u00f3w]].{{sfn|Hetherington|2012|p=92}} At the time of his birth, the village was part of the Russian Empire... and had been since 1795. Before that, it was in the territory of the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. After World War I, they became part of Poland again, and were in Poland at the time Pi\u0142sudski became Prime Minister of that country. During World War 2, the village became part of the USSR. As of 2020, they are in the [[\u0160ven\u010dionys District Municipality]] in Lithuania. The estate was part of the dowry brought by his mother, Maria, a member of the wealthy Billewicz family.{{sfn|J\u0119drzejewicz|1990|p=3}}{{sfn|Hetherington|2012|p=95}} The Pi\u0142sudski family, although pauperized,{{r|POleksa04}} cherished Polish patriotic traditions{{r|PolandGov|Urbank97_13-5}}, and are characterized either as Polish{{r|Lerski96_439|Davies05_40}} or as [[Polonized]]-Lithuanian.{{r|POleksa04|BidJef98_186}}{{Ref label|b|b|none}} J\u00f3zef was the second son born to the family.\nJ\u00f3zef, during the time he attended the Russian ''[[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]]'' in ''Wilno'' (now [[Vilnius]], [[Lithuania]]), was not an especially-diligent student.{{sfn|Roshwald|2001|p=36}} One of the younger Polish students at this gymnasium was the future Russian communist leader [[Felix Dzerzhinsky|Feliks Dzier\u017cy\u0144ski]], who later would become Pi\u0142sudski's arch-enemy.{{sfn|Blobaum|1984|p=30}} Along with his brothers [[Bronis\u0142aw Pi\u0142sudski|Bronis\u0142aw]], [[Adam Pi\u0142sudski|Adam]] and [[Jan Pi\u0142sudski|Jan]], J\u00f3zef was introduced by his mother Maria, ''n\u00e9e'' Billewicz, to Polish history and literature, which were suppressed by the Russian authorities.{{r|McM03_208}} His father, likewise named J\u00f3zef, fought in the [[January Uprising|January 1863 Uprising]] against Russian rule of Poland.{{r|PolandGov}}\n\n[[File:Jozef Pilsudski in 1899.jpg|thumb|125px|upright|Pi\u0142sudski in 1899]]\nThe family resented the Russian government's [[Russification]] policies. Young J\u00f3zef profoundly disliked having to attend [[Russian Orthodox Church]] service{{r|McM03_208}} and left school with an aversion not only for the [[Russian Tsar]] and the Russian Empire, but for the culture, which he knew well.{{r|POleksa04}}\n\nIn 1885 Pi\u0142sudski started [[medical school|medical studies]] at [[Kharkov University]] (now [[Kharkiv]], [[Ukraine]]), where he became involved with ''[[Narodnaya Volya (organization)|Narodnaya Volya]]'', part of the Russian ''[[Narodnik]]i'' revolutionary movement.{{r|PWN}} In 1886, he was suspended for participating in student demonstrations.{{r|PolandGov}} He was rejected by the [[University of Dorpat]] (now [[Tartu]], [[Estonia]]), whose authorities had been informed of his political affiliation.{{r|PolandGov}} On 22 March 1887, he was arrested by Tsarist authorities on a charge of plotting with [[Vilnius]] socialists to assassinate [[Tsar]] [[Alexander III of Russia|Alexander III]]. In fact, Pi\u0142sudski's main connection to the plot was the involvement of his elder brother [[Bronis\u0142aw Pi\u0142sudski|Bronis\u0142aw]], who was sentenced to fifteen years of [[hard labor]] (''[[katorga]]'') in eastern Siberia.{{r|ICRAP|Urbank97_50}}\n\nJ\u00f3zef received a milder sentence: five years' exile in [[Siberia]], first at [[Kirensk]] on the [[Lena River]], then at [[Tunka]].{{r|PolandGov|Urbank97_50}} While being transported in a prisoners' convoy to Siberia, Pi\u0142sudski was held for several weeks at a prison in [[Irkutsk]].{{r|LandauDunlop30_30}} There, he took part in what the authorities viewed as a revolt. After one of the inmates had insulted a guard and refused to apologize, he and other political prisoners were beaten by the guards for their defiance;{{r|Urbank97_62-6}} Pi\u0142sudski lost two teeth and took part in a subsequent hunger strike until the authorities reinstated political prisoners' privileges that had been suspended after the incident.{{r|Urbank97_62-6}} For his involvement, he was sentenced in 1888 to six months' imprisonment.{{r|Urbank97_68-9}} He had to spend the first night of his incarceration in 40-degree-below-zero Siberian cold; this led to an illness that nearly killed him and to health problems that would plague him throughout life.{{r|Urbank97_68-9}}\n\nDuring his years of exile in Siberia, Pi\u0142sudski met many ''[[Sybiraks]]'', including [[Bronis\u0142aw Szwarce]], who almost become a leader of the [[January Uprising|January 1863 Uprising]].{{r|Urbank97_74\u20137}} He was allowed to work in an occupation of his choosing, and earned his living tutoring local children in mathematics and foreign languages{{r|POleksa04}} (he knew French, German and Lithuanian in addition to Russian and his native Polish; he would later learn English).{{sfn|J\u0119drzejewicz|Cisek|1994|p=13}} Local officials decided, as a Polish noble, he was not entitled to the 10-[[Russian ruble|ruble]] pension received by most other exiles.{{r|Urbank97_71}} During the exile, he participated in a prisoner mutiny and two of his front teeth were knocked off when he was hit by the back of a gun \u2013 missing teeth is the reason for his characteristic, bushy [[mustache]].<ref>http://niezwykle.com/dlaczego-jozef-pilsudski-nosil-wasy-mimo-ze-wyszly-z-mody/</ref><ref>https://viva.pl/ludzie/newsy/tajemnica-wasow-jozefa-pilsudskiego-115488-r1/</ref>\n\nIn 1892, Pi\u0142sudski returned from exile, and settled in Adomavas Manor near Teneniai (now in [[\u0160ilal\u0117 district]]). In 1893, he joined the [[Polish Socialist Party]] (''PPS''){{r|PolandGov}}, and helped organize their Lithuanian branch.{{r|Urbank97_88}} Initially, he sided with the Socialists' more radical wing, but despite the socialist movement's ostensible [[proletarian internationalism|internationalism]], he remained a Polish nationalist.{{r|McM03_209}} In 1894, as its [[chief editor]], he published an [[bibu\u0142a|underground]] socialist newspaper, ''[[Robotnik (1894\u20131939)|Robotnik]]'' (The Worker); he would also be one of its chief writers, and, initially, a [[typesetter]].{{r|PolandGov|PWN|Urbank97_93}}{{sfn|Pi\u0142sudski|1989|p=12}} In 1895, he became a PPS leader, promoting the position doctrinal issues were of minor importance, and socialist ideology should be merged with nationalist ideology, since this combination offered the greatest chance of restoring Polish independence.{{r|PWN}}\n\nOn 15 July 1899, while an underground organizer, Pi\u0142sudski married a fellow socialist organizer, [[Maria Pi\u0142sudska|Maria Juszkiewiczowa, ''n\u00e9e'' Koplewska]].{{r|Alabrud99_99|Garlicki195_63|Pobog-Ma90_7}} According to his chief biographer, Wac\u0142aw J\u0119drzejewicz, the marriage was less romantic than pragmatic in nature. Both were very involved in the socialist and independence movements. The printing press of \"Robotnik\" was in their apartment first in [[Vilnius|Wilno]], then in [[\u0141\u00f3d\u017a]].

Pi\u0142sudski's PPS was the only political force prepared to fight the Empire for Polish independence and to resort to violence to achieve that goal.{{r|POleksa04}}\n\nOn the outbreak of the [[Russo-Japanese War]] (1904\u20131905), in the summer of 1904, Pi\u0142sudski traveled to Tokyo, Japan, where he tried unsuccessfully to obtain that country's assistance for an uprising in Poland. He offered to supply Japan with [[intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence]] in support of its war with Russia, and proposed the creation of a Polish Legion from Poles,{{r|Urbank97_109\u201311}} conscripted into the Russian Army, who had been captured by Japan. He also suggested a [[Prometheism#Sources of Prometheism|\"Promethean\" project]] directed at breaking up the Russian Empire, a goal that he later continued to pursue.{{sfn|Charaszkiewicz|2000|p=56}} Meeting with [[Yamagata Aritomo]], he suggested that starting a [[guerrilla war]] in Poland would distract Russia and asked for Japan to supply him with weapons.

He argued against Pi\u0142sudski's plan, endeavoring to discourage the Japanese government from supporting a Polish revolution, which Dmowski felt doomed to failure.{{r|Urbank97_109\u201311|Zamo87_330}} Dmowski, a Polish patriot, remained Pi\u0142sudski's political arch-enemy to the end of Pi\u0142sudski's life.{{r|Zamo87_332}} In the end, the Japanese offered Pi\u0142sudski much less than he hoped; he received Japan's help in purchasing weapons and ammunition for the PPS and their combat organisation, and the Japanese declined the Legion proposal.{{r|PolandGov|Urbank97_109\u201311}}\n\nIn the fall of 1904, Pi\u0142sudski formed a paramilitary unit (the [[Combat Organization of the Polish Socialist Party]], or ''boj\u00f3wki'') aiming to create an armed [[resistance movement]] against the Russian authorities.{{r|Zamo87_330}} The PPS organized an increasing numbers of demonstrations, mainly in [[Warsaw]]; on 28 October 1904, Russian [[Cossack]] [[cavalry]] attacked a demonstration, and in reprisal, during a demonstration on 13 November Pi\u0142sudski's paramilitary opened fire on Russian police and military.{{r|Zamo87_330|Urbank97_113\u20136}} Initially concentrating their attention on spies and informers, in March 1905 the paramilitary began using bombs to assassinate selected Russian police officers.{{r|Urbank97_117\u20138}}\n\nDuring the [[Russian Revolution of 1905]], Pi\u0142sudski played a leading role in events in [[Congress Poland]]. In early 1905 he ordered the PPS to launch a general strike there; it involved some 400,000 workers and lasted two months until it was broken by the Russian authorities.{{r|Zamo87_330}} In June 1905, Pi\u0142sudski sent paramilitary aid to an uprising in [[\u0141\u00f3d\u017a]]. During the \"[[\u0141\u00f3d\u017a insurrection (1905)|June Days]]\", as the \u0141\u00f3d\u017a uprising came to be known, armed clashes broke out between Pi\u0142sudski's paramilitaries and gunmen loyal to Dmowski and his [[National Democracy|National Democrats]].{{r|Zamo87_330}} On 22 December 1905, Pi\u0142sudski called for all Polish workers to rise up; the call went largely unheeded.{{r|Zamo87_330}}\n\nUnlike the National Democrats, Pi\u0142sudski instructed the PPS to boycott the elections to the [[First Duma]].{{r|Zamo87_330}} The decision, and his resolve to try to win Polish independence through revolution, caused tensions within the PPS, and in November 1906, the party fractured over Pi\u0142sudski's leadership.{{r|Zamo87_332}} His faction came to be called the \"Old Faction\" or \"Revolutionary Faction\" (\"''Starzy''\" or \"''[[Polish Socialist Party \u2013 Revolutionary Faction|Frakcja Rewolucyjna]]''\"), while their opponents were known as the \"Young Faction\", \"Moderate Faction\" or \"Left Wing\" (\"''M\u0142odzi''\", \"''Frakcja Umiarkowana''\", \"''[[Polish Socialist Party \u2013 Left|Lewica]]''\").

In 1906 Pi\u0142sudski, with the connivance of the Austrian authorities, founded a military school in [[Krak\u00f3w]] for the training of paramilitary units.{{r|Zamo87_332}} In 1906 alone, the 800-strong paramilitaries, operating in five-man teams in Congress Poland, killed 336 Russian officials; in subsequent years, the number of their casualties declined, and the paramilitaries' numbers increased to some 2,000 in 1908.{{r|Zamo87_332|Urbank97_121\u20132}}\n\nThe paramilitaries also held up Russian currency transports that were leaving Polish territories. On the night of 26/27 September 1908, they robbed a Russian mail train that was carrying tax revenues from Warsaw to Saint Petersburg.{{r|Zamo87_332}} Pi\u0142sudski, who took part in this [[Bezdany raid]] near Vilnius, used the funds thus \"expropriated\" to finance his secret military organization.{{r|EBritannica_JP}} The take from that single raid (200,812 rubles) was a fortune for the time and equaled the paramilitaries' entire takes of the two preceding years.{{r|Urbank97_121\u20132}}\n\n[[File:J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski with Supreme Command of Polish Military Organisation in 1917.PNG|266px|thumb|right|J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski with Supreme Command of [[Polish Military Organisation]] in 1917]]\n\nIn 1908, Pi\u0142sudski transformed his paramilitary units into an \"Association for Active Struggle\" (''[[Zwi\u0105zek Walki Czynnej]]'', or ''ZWC''), headed by three of his associates, [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Sikorski]], [[Marian Kukiel]] and [[Kazimierz Sosnkowski]].{{r|Zamo87_332}} The ''ZWC'''s main purpose was to train officers and [[noncommissioned officer]]s for a future Polish Army.{{r|PWN}}\n\nIn 1910, two legal paramilitary organizations were created in the Austrian zone of Poland, one in Lw\u00f3w (now [[Lviv]], Ukraine), and one in [[Krak\u00f3w]], to conduct training in [[military science]]. With the permission of the Austrian officials, Pi\u0142sudski founded a series of \"sporting clubs\", then the [[Zwi\u0105zek Strzelecki|Riflemen's Association]], for cover to train a Polish military force. In 1912, Pi\u0142sudski (using the ''[[nom de guerre]]'', \"''Mieczys\u0142aw''\") became commander-in-chief of a Riflemen's Association (''Zwi\u0105zek Strzelecki'').

It was predominantly socialist and introduced many reforms long proclaimed as necessary by the Polish Socialist Party, such as the [[eight-hour day]], free school education and [[women's suffrage]], to avoid major unrest.\n\nHowever, Pi\u0142sudski believed that as head of state, he must be above partisan politics.{{r|PWN|Cienciala02}} The day after his arrival in Warsaw, he met with old colleagues from underground days, who addressed him socialist-style as \"[[Comrade]]\" (\"''Towarzysz''\") and asked for his support for their revolutionary policies; he refused it and answered: \"Comrades, I took the red tram of socialism to the stop called Independence, and that's where I got off.

Pi\u0142sudski, however, was a staunch advocate of continuing the fight.{{r|Urbank97_341\u20136}} As [[Norman Davies]] noted, at that time, especially abroad, \"Pi\u0142sudski had nothing of his later prestige. As a pre-war revolutionary he led his party to splits and quarrels; as a general in World War I he led his legions to internment and disbanding; as a marshal of the Polish Army he led it to Kiev and Vilnius, both now lost to Poles. He left the Polish Socialist Party and his Austro-German allies; refused to ally himself with Entente.

The plan next required two armies under General [[J\u00f3zef Haller de Hallenburg|J\u00f3zef Haller]], facing Soviet frontal attack on Warsaw from the east, to hold their [[trench|entrenched]] positions at all costs. At the same time, an army under General [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Sikorski]] was to strike north from outside Warsaw, cutting off Soviet forces that sought to envelope the Polish capital from that direction. The most important role, however, was assigned to a relatively small, approximately 20,000-man, newly assembled \"Reserve Army\" (also known as the \"Strike Group\", \"''Grupa Uderzeniowa''\"), comprising the most determined, battle-hardened Polish units that were commanded personally by Pi\u0142sudski. Their task was to spearhead a lightning northward offensive, from the Vistula-Wieprz triangle south of Warsaw, through a weak spot that had been identified by Polish intelligence between the Soviet Western and Southwestern [[Front (Soviet Army)|Fronts]]. That offensive would separate the Soviet Western Front from its reserves and disorganize its movements. Eventually, the gap between Sikorski's army and the \"Strike Group\" would close near the [[East Prussia]]n border, bringing about the destruction of the encircled Soviet forces.{{r|Cisek02_1401|Urbank97_346-441_357-8}}\n\nAt the time, Pi\u0142sudski's plan was criticized, and only the desperate situation of the Polish forces persuaded other commanders to go along with it. Although based on reliable intelligence, including [[decryption|decrypted]] Soviet radio communications, the plan was termed \"amateurish\" by high-ranking army officers and military experts, quick to point out Pi\u0142sudski's lack of formal military education. After a copy of the plan fell into Soviet hands, Western Front commander [[Mikhail Tukhachevsky]] thought it to be a ruse and disregarded it.{{sfn|Davies|2003|p=197}} Days later, the Soviets paid dearly during the Battle of Warsaw, the overconfident [[Red Army]] suffered one of their worst defeats.{{r|Davies03_00|Urbank97_346-441_357-8}}\n\nA National Democrat ''[[Sejm]]'' deputy, [[Stanis\u0142aw Stro\u0144ski]], coined the phrase, \"Miracle at the Vistula\" (\"''Cud nad Wis\u0142\u0105''\"),{{r|G\u0142os05}} to express his disapproval of Pi\u0142sudski's \"Ukrainian adventure\".

A few English sources translate his first name as \"Joseph\", but this is not the common practice. As a young man, he belonged to underground organizations and used various pseudonyms, including \"''Wiktor''\", \"''Mieczys\u0142aw''\" and \"''Ziuk''\" (the latter also being his family nickname). Later he was often affectionately called \"''Dziadek''\" (\"Grandpa\" or \"the Old Man\") and \"''Marsza\u0142ek''\" (\"the Marshal\"). His ex-soldiers from the [[Polish Legions in World War I|Legions]] also referred to him as \"''Komendant''\" (\"the Commandant\").\n\n'''b.''' {{Note label|b|b|none}}Pi\u0142sudski sometimes spoke of being a Lithuanian of Polish culture.{{sfn|Davies|1986|p=139}} For several centuries, declaring both Lithuanian and Polish identity was not self-excluding alike in case of master of Polish poetry [[Adam Mickiewicz]]. The question of Pi\u0142sudski's ethnicity and culture simply does not match contemporary templates, the more the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]] which Pi\u0142sudski regarded as his spiritual ''patria'' failed to reborn itself and finally ceased to exist in the wake of arising modern nationalisms. [[Timothy Snyder]], who calls him a \"Polish-Lithuanian\", notes that Pi\u0142sudski did not think in terms of 20th-century nationalisms and [[ethnicity|ethnicities]]; he considered himself ''both'' a Pole and a Lithuanian, and his homeland was the historic [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]].{{sfn|Snyder|2004|p=70}}\n\n{{refend}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist|refs=\n<ref name=\"Dov Weissberg, I remember, page 116\">{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tHjtVJssL3kC&pg=PA116 |title=Dov Weissberg, I remember, page 116 |publisher=Google Books |accessdate=24 July 2011|isbn=978-965-294-124-4|date=1 January 1998}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Interview with Holocaust survivor Cyla Wiener\">{{cite web|url=http://holocaust.umd.umich.edu/wiener/section001.html |title=Interview with Holocaust survivor Cyla Wiener |publisher=Holocaust.umd.umich.edu |date=13 July 1992 |accessdate=24 July 2011}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=HydeP01_75>{{harvnb|Hyde-Price|2001|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=M-2Obqk-VZUC&pg=PA75 p. 75].}}</ref>\n\n<ref name=Alabrud99_99>{{harvnb|Alabrudzi\u0144ska|1999|p=99}}.</ref>\n\n<ref name=Boemeke98_314>{{harvnb|Boemeke et al.|1998 |loc=[https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0521621321&id=zqj-oHp4KsgC&pg=RA1-PA314 p. 314]}}.</ref>\n\n<ref name=\"Bel\">{{cite journal |language=pl |last=Baliszewski |first=Dariusz |authorlink=Dariusz Baliszewski |url=http://www.wprost.pl/ar/?O=70406 |title=Ostatnia wojna marsza\u0142ka |journal=[[Wprost]] |issue=48/2004;

the [[Naczelnik pa\u0144stwa|Chief of State]] (1918\u201322) and [[Marshal of Poland|First Marshal]] of [[Second Polish Republic|Poland]] (from 1920). He was considered the ''de facto'' leader (1926\u201335) of the Second Polish Republic as the [[Ministry of National Defence (Poland)|Minister of Military Affairs]]. After World War I, he held great power in [[Politics of Poland|Polish politics]] and was a distinguished figure on the international scene.{{sfn|Plach|2006|p=14}} He is viewed as a father of the Second Polish Republic re-established in 1918, 123 years after the final [[Partitions of Poland|Partition of Poland]] by [[Austria-Hungary|Austria]], [[Prussia]] and [[Russian Empire|Russia]] in 1795.{{r|DroSzwa95_911|Lieven94_159}}{{sfn|Lerski|1996|loc=[https://books.google.com/?id=QTUTqE2difgC&pg=PA441 p. 441]}}{{sfn|Held|1992|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=5O5NkwX-NnYC&pg=PA249 p. 249]}}\n\nSeeing himself as a descendant of the culture and traditions of the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]],{{r|Davies05_10}} Pi\u0142sudski believed in a multi-ethnic Poland\u2014\"a home of nations\" including indigenous ethnic and religious minorities he hoped would establish a robust union with the independent states of [[Lithuania]] and [[Ukraine]].{{r|Davies05_10}} His principal political antagonist, [[Roman Dmowski]], leader of the [[National Democrats (Poland)|National Democrat party]], by contrast, called for a Poland limited to the pre-Partitions [[Kingdom of Poland (1025\u20131385)|Polish Crown]] and based mainly on a homogeneous ethnically Polish population and [[Catholicism|Roman Catholic]] identity.\n\nEarly in his political career, Pi\u0142sudski became a leader of the [[Polish Socialist Party]].  Believing Poland's independence would be won militarily, he formed the [[Polish Legions in World War I|Polish Legions]].  In 1914, he predicted a new major war would defeat the [[Russian Empire]] and the [[Central Powers]].{{r|Roos+Rothschild}}  After [[World War I]] began in 1914, Pi\u0142sudski's Legions fought alongside [[Austria-Hungary]] against Russia.  In 1917, with [[Imperial Russia|Imperialist Russia]] faring poorly in the war, he withdrew his support for the Central Powers, and was imprisoned in [[Magdeburg]] by the Germans.\n\nFrom November 1918, when Poland regained its independence, until 1922, Pi\u0142sudski was Poland's [[Naczelnik Pa\u0144stwa|Chief of State]]. In 1919\u201321 he commanded Polish forces in six border wars that re-defined the country's borders.  On the verge of defeat in the [[Polish\u2013Soviet War]] his forces, in the August 1920 [[Battle of Warsaw (1920)|Battle of Warsaw]], threw back the invading Soviet Russians.  In 1923, with the government dominated by his opponents, in particular the [[National Democracy|National Democrats]], Pi\u0142sudski retired from active politics. Three years later he returned to power in the [[May Coup (Poland)|May 1926 ''coup d'\u00e9tat'']] and became Poland's [[Strongman (politics)|strongman]]. From then on until his death in 1935, he concerned himself primarily with military and foreign affairs. It was during this period that he developed a [[J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski's cult of personality|cult of personality]] that has survived into the 21st century.\n\nIn international affairs, Pi\u0142sudski pursued two complementary strategies meant to secure Poland's independence and enhance national security: \"[[Prometheism]]\", aimed at achieving the disintegration of [[Imperial Russia]] and later the [[Soviet Union]] into their constituent nations; and the creation of an [[Intermarium]] federation of [[Central and Eastern Europe]] and states between the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] and [[Black Sea]]s, to secure its peoples against [[Western Europe|Western]] and Eastern European [[imperialism]]s.{{sfn|Davies|2005|loc=[https://books.google.ca/books?id=9Tbed6iMNLEC&pg=PA55 55]}}\n\nHistorian [[Piotr S. Wandycz|Piotr Wandycz]] characterizes Pi\u0142sudski as \"an ardent Polish patriot who on occasion would castigate the Poles for their stupidity, cowardice, or servility. He described himself as a [[Polish-Lithuanian identity|Polish-Lithuanian]], and was stubborn and reserved, loath to show his emotions.\"{{sfn|Wandycz|1990|p=452}} Some aspects of Pi\u0142sudski's administration, such as establishing [[Bereza Kartuska prison]], remain controversial. Yet, he is highly-esteemed in Polish memory, and is regarded, together with his chief antagonist [[Roman Dmowski]], as a founder of the modern independent Poland.\n\n==Early life==\n[[File:Piludski w szkole.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Pi\u0142sudski as a schoolboy]]\nHe was born 5 December 1867 to the [[szlachta|noble]] [[Pi\u0142sudski family|family Pi\u0142sudski]], at their manor near the village of [[Zu\u0142\u00f3w]].{{sfn|Hetherington|2012|p=92}} At the time of his birth, the village was part of the Russian Empire... and had been since 1795. Before that, it was in the territory of the [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. After World War I, they became part of Poland again, and were in Poland at the time Pi\u0142sudski became Prime Minister of that country. During World War 2, the village became part of the USSR. As of 2020, they are in the [[\u0160ven\u010dionys District Municipality]] in Lithuania. The estate was part of the dowry brought by his mother, Maria, a member of the wealthy Billewicz family.{{sfn|J\u0119drzejewicz|1990|p=3}}{{sfn|Hetherington|2012|p=95}} The Pi\u0142sudski family, although pauperized,{{r|POleksa04}} cherished Polish patriotic traditions{{r|PolandGov|Urbank97_13-5}}, and are characterized either as Polish{{r|Lerski96_439|Davies05_40}} or as [[Polonized]]-Lithuanian.{{r|POleksa04|BidJef98_186}}{{Ref label|b|b|none}} J\u00f3zef was the second son born to the family.\nJ\u00f3zef, during the time he attended the Russian ''[[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]]'' in ''Wilno'' (now [[Vilnius]], [[Lithuania]]), was not an especially-diligent student.{{sfn|Roshwald|2001|p=36}} One of the younger Polish students at this gymnasium was the future Russian communist leader [[Felix Dzerzhinsky|Feliks Dzier\u017cy\u0144ski]], who later would become Pi\u0142sudski's arch-enemy.{{sfn|Blobaum|1984|p=30}} Along with his brothers [[Bronis\u0142aw Pi\u0142sudski|Bronis\u0142aw]], [[Adam Pi\u0142sudski|Adam]] and [[Jan Pi\u0142sudski|Jan]], J\u00f3zef was introduced by his mother Maria, ''n\u00e9e'' Billewicz, to Polish history and literature, which were suppressed by the Russian authorities.{{r|McM03_208}} His father, likewise named J\u00f3zef, fought in the [[January Uprising|January 1863 Uprising]] against Russian rule of Poland.{{r|PolandGov}}\n\n[[File:Jozef Pilsudski in 1899.jpg|thumb|125px|upright|Pi\u0142sudski in 1899]]\nThe family resented the Russian government's [[Russification]] policies. Young J\u00f3zef profoundly disliked having to attend [[Russian Orthodox Church]] service{{r|McM03_208}} and left school with an aversion not only for the [[Russian Tsar]] and the Russian Empire, but for the culture, which he knew well.{{r|POleksa04}}\n\nIn 1885 Pi\u0142sudski started [[medical school|medical studies]] at [[Kharkov University]] (now [[Kharkiv]], [[Ukraine]]), where he became involved with ''[[Narodnaya Volya (organization)|Narodnaya Volya]]'', part of the Russian ''[[Narodnik]]i'' revolutionary movement.{{r|PWN}} In 1886, he was suspended for participating in student demonstrations.{{r|PolandGov}} He was rejected by the [[University of Dorpat]] (now [[Tartu]], [[Estonia]]), whose authorities had been informed of his political affiliation.{{r|PolandGov}} On 22 March 1887, he was arrested by Tsarist authorities on a charge of plotting with [[Vilnius]] socialists to assassinate [[Tsar]] [[Alexander III of Russia|Alexander III]]. In fact, Pi\u0142sudski's main connection to the plot was the involvement of his elder brother [[Bronis\u0142aw Pi\u0142sudski|Bronis\u0142aw]], who was sentenced to fifteen years of [[hard labor]] (''[[katorga]]'') in eastern Siberia.{{r|ICRAP|Urbank97_50}}\n\nJ\u00f3zef received a milder sentence: five years' exile in [[Siberia]], first at [[Kirensk]] on the [[Lena River]], then at [[Tunka]].{{r|PolandGov|Urbank97_50}} While being transported in a prisoners' convoy to Siberia, Pi\u0142sudski was held for several weeks at a prison in [[Irkutsk]].{{r|LandauDunlop30_30}} There, he took part in what the authorities viewed as a revolt. After one of the inmates had insulted a guard and refused to apologize, he and other political prisoners were beaten by the guards for their defiance;{{r|Urbank97_62-6}} Pi\u0142sudski lost two teeth and took part in a subsequent hunger strike until the authorities reinstated political prisoners' privileges that had been suspended after the incident.{{r|Urbank97_62-6}} For his involvement, he was sentenced in 1888 to six months' imprisonment.{{r|Urbank97_68-9}} He had to spend the first night of his incarceration in 40-degree-below-zero Siberian cold; this led to an illness that nearly killed him and to health problems that would plague him throughout life.{{r|Urbank97_68-9}}\n\nDuring his years of exile in Siberia, Pi\u0142sudski met many ''[[Sybiraks]]'', including [[Bronis\u0142aw Szwarce]], who almost become a leader of the [[January Uprising|January 1863 Uprising]].{{r|Urbank97_74\u20137}} He was allowed to work in an occupation of his choosing, and earned his living tutoring local children in mathematics and foreign languages{{r|POleksa04}} (he knew French, German and Lithuanian in addition to Russian and his native Polish; he would later learn English).{{sfn|J\u0119drzejewicz|Cisek|1994|p=13}} Local officials decided, as a Polish noble, he was not entitled to the 10-[[Russian ruble|ruble]] pension received by most other exiles.{{r|Urbank97_71}} During the exile, he participated in a prisoner mutiny and two of his front teeth were knocked off when he was hit by the back of a gun \u2013 missing teeth is the reason for his characteristic, bushy [[mustache]].<ref>http://niezwykle.com/dlaczego-jozef-pilsudski-nosil-wasy-mimo-ze-wyszly-z-mody/</ref><ref>https://viva.pl/ludzie/newsy/tajemnica-wasow-jozefa-pilsudskiego-115488-r1/</ref>\n\nIn 1892, Pi\u0142sudski returned from exile, and settled in Adomavas Manor near Teneniai (now in [[\u0160ilal\u0117 district]]). In 1893, he joined the [[Polish Socialist Party]] (''PPS''){{r|PolandGov}}, and helped organize their Lithuanian branch.{{r|Urbank97_88}} Initially, he sided with the Socialists' more radical wing, but despite the socialist movement's ostensible [[proletarian internationalism|internationalism]], he remained a Polish nationalist.{{r|McM03_209}} In 1894, as its [[chief editor]], he published an [[bibu\u0142a|underground]] socialist newspaper, ''[[Robotnik (1894\u20131939)|Robotnik]]'' (The Worker); he would also be one of its chief writers, and, initially, a [[typesetter]].{{r|PolandGov|PWN|Urbank97_93}}{{sfn|Pi\u0142sudski|1989|p=12}} In 1895, he became a PPS leader, promoting the position doctrinal issues were of minor importance, and socialist ideology should be merged with nationalist ideology, since this combination offered the greatest chance of restoring Polish independence.{{r|PWN}}\n\nOn 15 July 1899, while an underground organizer, Pi\u0142sudski married a fellow socialist organizer, [[Maria Pi\u0142sudska|Maria Juszkiewiczowa, ''n\u00e9e'' Koplewska]].{{r|Alabrud99_99|Garlicki195_63|Pobog-Ma90_7}} According to his chief biographer, Wac\u0142aw J\u0119drzejewicz, the marriage was less romantic than pragmatic in nature. Both were very involved in the socialist and independence movements. The printing press of \"Robotnik\" was in their apartment first in [[Vilnius|Wilno]], then in [[\u0141\u00f3d\u017a]]. A pretext of regular family life made them less subject to suspicion. Russian law also protected a wife from prosecution for the illegal activities of her husband.{{sfn|J\u0119drzejewicz|1990|loc=pp. 27\u20138 (1982 ed.)}} The marriage deteriorated after, several years later, Pi\u0142sudski began an affair with a younger socialist,{{r|McM03_209}} [[Aleksandra Pi\u0142sudska|Aleksandra Szczerbi\u0144ska]]. Maria died in 1921, and in October, Pi\u0142sudski married Aleksandra. By then, the couple had two daughters, [[Wanda Pi\u0142sudska|Wanda]] and [[Jadwiga Pi\u0142sudska|Jadwiga]].\n\n[[File:Lingwood 1898.jpg|thumb|left|\"Lingwood\", [[Leytonstone]], where Pi\u0142sudski stayed in 1900]]\nIn February 1900, after Russian authorities found ''Robotnik'''s underground printing press in [[\u0141\u00f3d\u017a]], Pi\u0142sudski was imprisoned at the [[Warsaw Citadel]]. But, after feigning mental illness in May 1901, he managed to escape from a mental hospital at [[Saint Petersburg]] with the help of a Polish physician, [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Mazurkiewicz (physician)|W\u0142adys\u0142aw Mazurkiewicz]], and others, fleeing to [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]], then part of [[Austria-Hungary]], and thence to [[Leytonstone]] in London, staying with [[Leon Wasilewski]] and his family.{{r|PolandGov}}\n\nDuring this period, almost all parties in Russian Poland and Lithuania took a conciliatory position toward the Russian Empire and aimed at negotiating within it a limited autonomy for Poland. Pi\u0142sudski's PPS was the only political force prepared to fight the Empire for Polish independence and to resort to violence to achieve that goal.{{r|POleksa04}}\n\nOn the outbreak of the [[Russo-Japanese War]] (1904\u20131905), in the summer of 1904, Pi\u0142sudski traveled to Tokyo, Japan, where he tried unsuccessfully to obtain that country's assistance for an uprising in Poland. He offered to supply Japan with [[intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence]] in support of its war with Russia, and proposed the creation of a Polish Legion from Poles,{{r|Urbank97_109\u201311}} conscripted into the Russian Army, who had been captured by Japan. He also suggested a [[Prometheism#Sources of Prometheism|\"Promethean\" project]] directed at breaking up the Russian Empire, a goal that he later continued to pursue.{{sfn|Charaszkiewicz|2000|p=56}} Meeting with [[Yamagata Aritomo]], he suggested that starting a [[guerrilla war]] in Poland would distract Russia and asked for Japan to supply him with weapons. Although the Japanese diplomat [[Hayashi Tadasu]] supported the plan, the Japanese government, including Yamagata, was more skeptical.{{sfn|Kowner|2006|p=285}}\n\nPi\u0142sudski's arch-rival [[Roman Dmowski]] travelled to Japan. He argued against Pi\u0142sudski's plan, endeavoring to discourage the Japanese government from supporting a Polish revolution, which Dmowski felt doomed to failure.{{r|Urbank97_109\u201311|Zamo87_330}} Dmowski, a Polish patriot, remained Pi\u0142sudski's political arch-enemy to the end of Pi\u0142sudski's life.{{r|Zamo87_332}} In the end, the Japanese offered Pi\u0142sudski much less than he hoped; he received Japan's help in purchasing weapons and ammunition for the PPS and their combat organisation, and the Japanese declined the Legion proposal.{{r|PolandGov|Urbank97_109\u201311}}\n\nIn the fall of 1904, Pi\u0142sudski formed a paramilitary unit (the [[Combat Organization of the Polish Socialist Party]], or ''boj\u00f3wki'') aiming to create an armed [[resistance movement]] against the Russian authorities.{{r|Zamo87_330}} The PPS organized an increasing numbers of demonstrations, mainly in [[Warsaw]]; on 28 October 1904, Russian [[Cossack]] [[cavalry]] attacked a demonstration, and in reprisal, during a demonstration on 13 November Pi\u0142sudski's paramilitary opened fire on Russian police and military.{{r|Zamo87_330|Urbank97_113\u20136}} Initially concentrating their attention on spies and informers, in March 1905 the paramilitary began using bombs to assassinate selected Russian police officers.{{r|Urbank97_117\u20138}}\n\nDuring the [[Russian Revolution of 1905]], Pi\u0142sudski played a leading role in events in [[Congress Poland]]. In early 1905 he ordered the PPS to launch a general strike there; it involved some 400,000 workers and lasted two months until it was broken by the Russian authorities.{{r|Zamo87_330}} In June 1905, Pi\u0142sudski sent paramilitary aid to an uprising in [[\u0141\u00f3d\u017a]]. During the \"[[\u0141\u00f3d\u017a insurrection (1905)|June Days]]\", as the \u0141\u00f3d\u017a uprising came to be known, armed clashes broke out between Pi\u0142sudski's paramilitaries and gunmen loyal to Dmowski and his [[National Democracy|National Democrats]].{{r|Zamo87_330}} On 22 December 1905, Pi\u0142sudski called for all Polish workers to rise up; the call went largely unheeded.{{r|Zamo87_330}}\n\nUnlike the National Democrats, Pi\u0142sudski instructed the PPS to boycott the elections to the [[First Duma]].{{r|Zamo87_330}} The decision, and his resolve to try to win Polish independence through revolution, caused tensions within the PPS, and in November 1906, the party fractured over Pi\u0142sudski's leadership.{{r|Zamo87_332}} His faction came to be called the \"Old Faction\" or \"Revolutionary Faction\" (\"''Starzy''\" or \"''[[Polish Socialist Party \u2013 Revolutionary Faction|Frakcja Rewolucyjna]]''\"), while their opponents were known as the \"Young Faction\", \"Moderate Faction\" or \"Left Wing\" (\"''M\u0142odzi''\", \"''Frakcja Umiarkowana''\", \"''[[Polish Socialist Party \u2013 Left|Lewica]]''\"). The \"Young\" sympathized with the [[Social Democracy of the Kingdom of Poland and Lithuania|Social Democrats of the Kingdom of Poland and Lithuania]], and believed priority should be given to co-operation with Russian revolutionaries in toppling the tsarist regime and creating a socialist [[utopia]] to facilitate negotiations for independence.{{r|PWN}}\n\nPi\u0142sudski and his supporters in the Revolutionary Faction continued to plot a revolution against Tsarist Russia to secure Polish independence.{{r|PolandGov}} By 1909, his faction was the majority in the PPS, and Pi\u0142sudski remained an important PPS leaders until the outbreak of the First World War.{{r|Urbank97_131}}\n\nPi\u0142sudski anticipated a coming European war{{r|Roos+Rothschild}} with the need to organize the nucleus of a future Polish Army to secure Poland's independence from the three empires partitioning them out of political existence in the late 18th century. In 1906 Pi\u0142sudski, with the connivance of the Austrian authorities, founded a military school in [[Krak\u00f3w]] for the training of paramilitary units.{{r|Zamo87_332}} In 1906 alone, the 800-strong paramilitaries, operating in five-man teams in Congress Poland, killed 336 Russian officials; in subsequent years, the number of their casualties declined, and the paramilitaries' numbers increased to some 2,000 in 1908.{{r|Zamo87_332|Urbank97_121\u20132}}\n\nThe paramilitaries also held up Russian currency transports that were leaving Polish territories. On the night of 26/27 September 1908, they robbed a Russian mail train that was carrying tax revenues from Warsaw to Saint Petersburg.{{r|Zamo87_332}} Pi\u0142sudski, who took part in this [[Bezdany raid]] near Vilnius, used the funds thus \"expropriated\" to finance his secret military organization.{{r|EBritannica_JP}} The take from that single raid (200,812 rubles) was a fortune for the time and equaled the paramilitaries' entire takes of the two preceding years.{{r|Urbank97_121\u20132}}\n\n[[File:J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski with Supreme Command of Polish Military Organisation in 1917.PNG|266px|thumb|right|J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski with Supreme Command of [[Polish Military Organisation]] in 1917]]\n\nIn 1908, Pi\u0142sudski transformed his paramilitary units into an \"Association for Active Struggle\" (''[[Zwi\u0105zek Walki Czynnej]]'', or ''ZWC''), headed by three of his associates, [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Sikorski]], [[Marian Kukiel]] and [[Kazimierz Sosnkowski]].{{r|Zamo87_332}} The ''ZWC'''s main purpose was to train officers and [[noncommissioned officer]]s for a future Polish Army.{{r|PWN}}\n\nIn 1910, two legal paramilitary organizations were created in the Austrian zone of Poland, one in Lw\u00f3w (now [[Lviv]], Ukraine), and one in [[Krak\u00f3w]], to conduct training in [[military science]]. With the permission of the Austrian officials, Pi\u0142sudski founded a series of \"sporting clubs\", then the [[Zwi\u0105zek Strzelecki|Riflemen's Association]], for cover to train a Polish military force. In 1912, Pi\u0142sudski (using the ''[[nom de guerre]]'', \"''Mieczys\u0142aw''\") became commander-in-chief of a Riflemen's Association (''Zwi\u0105zek Strzelecki''). By 1914, they increased to 12,000 men.{{r|PolandGov|Zamo87_332}} In 1914, Pi\u0142sudski declared, \"Only the sword now carries any weight in the balance for the destiny of a nation.\"{{r|Zamo87_332}}\n\n==World War I==\n[[File:Jozef Pilsudski3.jpg|thumb|right|Pi\u0142sudski in uniform]]\n{{Main|History of Poland during World War I}}\nAt a meeting in Paris in 1914, Pi\u0142sudski presciently declared, in the impending war, for Poland to regain independence, Russia must be beaten by the Central Powers (the Austro-Hungarian and German Empires), and the latter powers must in their turn be beaten by [[French Third Republic|France]], [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] and the United States.{{r|Roos+Rothschild}} By contrast, [[Roman Dmowski]], Pi\u0142sudski's rival, believed the best way to achieve a unified and independent Poland was to support the [[Triple Entente]] against the Central Powers.{{r|Zamo87_333}}\n[[File:Jozef Pilsudski2.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Pi\u0142sudski in World War I (1914)]]\nAt the outbreak of the war on 3 August in [[Krak\u00f3w]], Pi\u0142sudski formed a small [[En cadre|cadre]] military unit, the [[First Cadre Company]], from members of the [[Riflemen's Association]] and [[Polish Rifle Squads]].{{r|Urbank97_171\u20132}} That same day, [[The Seven Lancers of Belina|a cavalry unit]] under [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Belina-Pra\u017cmowski]] were sent to [[reconnoitre]] across the Russian border before the official [[declaration of war]] between Austria-Hungary and Russia on 6 August.{{r|Urbank97_168}}\n\nPi\u0142sudski's strategy was to send his forces north across the border into [[Congress Poland|Russian Poland]] into an area the [[Military history of Imperial Russia|Russian Army]] evacuated in the hope of breaking through to Warsaw and sparking a nation-wide revolution.{{r|PWN|Cienciala02}} Using his limited forces in those early days, he backed his orders with the sanction of a fictitious \"National Government in Warsaw\",{{r|Urbank97_174\u20135}} and he bent and stretched Austrian orders to the utmost, taking initiatives, moving forward, and establishing Polish institutions in liberated towns while the Austrians saw his forces as good only for scouting or for supporting main Austrian formations.{{r|Urbank97_178\u20139}} On 12 August 1914, Pi\u0142sudski's forces took the town of [[Kielce]], of [[Kielce Governorate]], but Pi\u0142sudski found the residents less supportive than he had expected.{{r|Urbank97_170\u20131_180\u20132}}\n\nSoon afterward he officially established the [[Polish Legions in World War I|Polish Legions]], taking personal command of their [[I Brigade of the Polish Legions|First Brigade]],{{r|PolandGov}} which he would lead successfully into several victorious battles.{{r|PWN}} He also secretly informed the British government in the fall of 1914 that his Legions would never fight France or Britain, only Russia.{{r|Cienciala02}}\n[[File:Pilsudski and officers 1915.jpg|thumb|left|Pi\u0142sudski and his officers, 1915]]\nPi\u0142sudski decreed that Legions' personnel were to be addressed by the [[French Revolution]]-inspired \"Citizen\" (''Obywatel''), and he was referred to as \"the Commandant\" (\"''Komendant''\").{{r|Zamo87_333}} Pi\u0142sudski enjoyed extreme respect and loyalty from his men,{{r|Zamo87_333}} which would remain for years to come. The Polish Legions fought against Russia, at the side of the Central Powers, until 1917.\n\nSoon after forming the Legions, also in 1914, Pi\u0142sudski set up another organization, the [[Polish Military Organisation]] (''Polska Organizacja Wojskowa''), which served as a precursor [[Polish intelligence]] agency and was designed to perform espionage and sabotage missions.{{r|PWN|Cienciala02}}\n[[File:Jacek Malczewski, Portret brygadiera J\u00f3zefa Pi\u0142sudskiego.jpg|thumb|Pi\u0142sudski.

He backed that demand with his own proffered resignation and that of many of the Legions' officers.{{r|Urbank97_251\u20132}} On 5 November 1916 the Central Powers proclaimed the \"independence\" of Poland, hoping to increase the number of Polish troops that could be sent to the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern Front]] against Russia, thereby relieving German forces to bolster the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]].{{r|EBritannica_JP|Biskupski2000}}\n\nPi\u0142sudski agreed to serve in the [[Kingdom of Poland (1916\u20131918)|Regency Kingdom of Poland]], created by the Central Powers, and acted as [[minister of war]] in the newly formed [[Polish Regency government]]; as such, he was responsible for the [[Polnische Wehrmacht]].{{r|Zamo87_333}} After the [[February Revolution|Russian Revolution in early 1917]], and in view of the worsening situation of the Central Powers, Pi\u0142sudski took an increasingly uncompromising stance, insisting that his men no longer be treated as \"German [[colonial troops]]\" and but be used to fight only Russia. Anticipating the Central Powers' defeat in the war, he did not wish to be allied with the losing side.{{r|Rothschild90_45|Urbank97_253}} In the aftermath of a July 1917 \"[[Oath Crisis]]\" when Pi\u0142sudski forbade Polish soldiers to swear a [[loyalty oath]] to the Central Powers, he was arrested and imprisoned at [[Magdeburg]]; the Polish units were disbanded and the men were incorporated into the [[Austro-Hungarian Army]]{{r|PolandGov|Cienciala02}} while the [[Polish Military Organization]] began attacking German targets.{{r|PWN}} Pi\u0142sudski's arrest greatly enhanced his reputation among Poles, many of whom began to see him as the most determined Polish leader, who was willing to take on all the partitioning powers.{{r|PWN}}\n\nOn 8 November 1918, three days before the [[Armistice with Germany (Compi\u00e8gne)|Armistice]], Pi\u0142sudski and his colleague, Colonel [[Kazimierz Sosnkowski]], were released by the Germans from Magdeburg and soon, like [[Vladimir Lenin]] before them, placed on a private train, bound for their national capital, as the collapsing Germans hoped that Pi\u0142sudski would create a force that was friendly to them.{{r|Cienciala02}}\n\n==Rebuilding Poland==\n[[File:Ulica Mokotowska 50, Warsaw.JPG|thumb|right|''Ulica Mokotowska 50'', Warsaw, where Pi\u0142sudski stayed 13\u201329 November 1918, after his release from [[Magdeburg]]]]\n[[File:Polski automobil pancerny z obrony Lwowa 1918-19.JPG|thumb|''Pi\u0142sudski'' improvised armored car, 1919, named after Pi\u0142sudski]]\nOn 11 November 1918 in Warsaw, Pi\u0142sudski was appointed [[Commander in Chief]] of Polish forces by the [[Regency Council (Poland)|Regency Council]] and was entrusted with creating a national government for the newly independent country.

Over 55,000 Germans peacefully departed Poland, leaving their weapons to the Poles. In coming months, over 400,000 total departed Polish territories.{{r|Cienciala02|Urbank97_256_277\u20138}}\n\nOn 14 November 1918, Pi\u0142sudski was asked to supervise provisionally the running of the country. On 22 November he officially received, from the new government of [[J\u0119drzej Moraczewski]], the title of Provisional Chief of State (''Naczelnik Pa\u0144stwa'') of renascent Poland.{{r|PolandGov}}\n\nVarious Polish military organizations and provisional governments (the [[Regency Council (Poland)|Regency Council]] in Warsaw; [[Ignacy Daszy\u0144ski]]'s government in [[Lublin]]; and the [[Polish Liquidation Committee]] in [[Krak\u00f3w]]) bowed to Pi\u0142sudski, who set about forming a new coalition government. It was predominantly socialist and introduced many reforms long proclaimed as necessary by the Polish Socialist Party, such as the [[eight-hour day]], free school education and [[women's suffrage]], to avoid major unrest.\n\nHowever, Pi\u0142sudski believed that as head of state, he must be above partisan politics.{{r|PWN|Cienciala02}} The day after his arrival in Warsaw, he met with old colleagues from underground days, who addressed him socialist-style as \"[[Comrade]]\" (\"''Towarzysz''\") and asked for his support for their revolutionary policies; he refused it and answered: \"Comrades, I took the red tram of socialism to the stop called Independence, and that's where I got off. You may keep on to the final stop if you wish, but from now on let's address each other as '[[Slavic honorifics|Mister']] [rather than continue using the socialist term of address, 'Comrade']!\"{{r|PolandGov}} He declined to support any party and did not form any political organization of his own; instead, he advocated creating a coalition government.{{r|PWN|Suleja04_202}} He also set about organizing a Polish army out of Polish veterans of the German, Russian and Austrian armies.\n\nIn the days immediately after the war, Pi\u0142sudski attempted to build a government in a shattered country. Much of former Russian Poland had been destroyed in the war, and systematic looting by the Germans had reduced the region's wealth by at least 10%.{{r|McM03_210}} A British diplomat who visited Warsaw in January 1919 reported: \"I have nowhere seen anything like the evidences of extreme poverty and wretchedness that meet one's eye at almost every turn.\"{{r|McM03_210}}\n\nIn addition, the country had to unify the disparate systems of law, economics, and [[administration (government)|administration]] in the former German, Austrian, and Russian sectors of Poland. There were nine legal systems, five currencies, and 66 types of rail systems (with 165 models of locomotives), each needing to be consolidated.{{r|McM03_210}}\n[[File:Warszawaid4.jpg|thumb|Statue of Pi\u0142sudski before Warsaw's [[Belweder]] Palace, Pi\u0142sudski's official residence during his years in power]]\n\n[[Wac\u0142aw J\u0119drzejewicz]], in ''Pi\u0142sudski: A Life for Poland'', described Pi\u0142sudski as very deliberate in his decision-making:  Pi\u0142sudski collected all available pertinent information, then took his time weighing it before arriving at a final decision.  He drove himself hard, working all day and all night.{{r|McM03_210}} He maintained a simple lifestyle, eating plain meals alone at an inexpensive restaurant.{{r|McM03_210}} Though he was popular with much of the Polish public, his reputation as a loner (the result of many years' underground work) and as a man who distrusted almost everyone led to strained relations with other Polish politicians.{{r|McM03_209}}\n\nPi\u0142sudski and the first Polish government were distrusted in the West because he had co-operated with the Central Powers in 1914 to 1917 and because the governments of Daszy\u0144ski and J\u0119drzej Moraczewski were primarily socialist.{{r|Cienciala02}} It was not until January 1919, when the world-famous pianist and composer [[Ignacy Jan Paderewski]] became [[Prime Minister of Poland]] and foreign minister of a new government, that it was recognized in the West.{{r|Cienciala02}}\n\nThat still left two separate governments claiming to be Poland's legitimate government: Pi\u0142sudski's in Warsaw and Dmowski's in Paris.{{r|McM03_210}} To ensure that Poland had a single government and to avert civil war, Paderewski met with Dmowski and Pi\u0142sudski and persuaded them to join forces, with Pi\u0142sudski acting as Provisional Chief of State and [[Commander-in-Chief]] while Dmowski and Paderewski represented Poland at the [[Paris Peace Conference of 1919|Paris Peace Conference]].{{r|McM03_213-4}} Articles 87\u201393 of the [[Treaty of Versailles]]{{r|VersaillesTreaty1919_87-93}} and the [[Little Treaty of Versailles]], signed on 28 June 1919, formally established Poland as an independent and sovereign state in the international arena.{{r|Grant99_114}}\n\n[[File:PL Turek Pilsudski Monument 11.jpg|thumb|[[J\u00f3zef Pi\u0142sudski monument, Turek|Pi\u0142sudski monument]], [[Turek]] (designed in 1936)]]\nPi\u0142sudski often clashed with Dmowski for viewing the Poles as the dominant nationality in renascent Poland, and attempting to send the [[Blue Army (Poland)|Blue Army]] to Poland through Danzig, Germany (now [[Gda\u0144sk]], Poland).{{r|McM03_211-214|Boemeke98_314}} On 5 January 1919, some of Dmowski's supporters ([[Marian Januszajtis-\u017begota]] and [[Eustachy Sapieha]]) attempted [[Polish Coup (1919)|a coup]] against Pi\u0142sudski and Prime Minister Moraczewski, but they failed.{{r|Urbank97_499\u2013501}}\n\nOn 20 February 1919, Pi\u0142sudski proclaimed he would relinquish his powers to the new Polish parliament (''[[Sejm]]''). However, the ''Sejm'' re-instated his office in the [[Little Constitution of 1919]]. The word \"Provisional\" was struck from his title, and Pi\u0142sudski held the office until 9 December 1922, after [[Gabriel Narutowicz]] was elected as the first [[president of Poland]].{{r|PolandGov}}\n\nPi\u0142sudski's major foreign policy initiative was a proposed federation (to be called ''\"[[Mi\u0119dzymorze]]\"'' ([[Polish language|Polish]] for \"Between-Seas\"), and known from the [[Latin]] as ''[[Intermarium]]'', stretching from the [[Baltic Sea]] to the [[Black Sea]]). It was to consist of Poland, the independent [[Baltic states]], [[Belarus]], and [[Ukraine]],{{r|Cienciala02}} somewhat in emulation of the [[partitions of Poland|pre-partition]] [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]].{{r|PWN}}{{sfn|J\u0119drzejewicz|1990|p=93}}\n\nPi\u0142sudski's plan met with opposition from most of the prospective member states, which refused to relinquish any of their hard-won independence, as well as from the Allied powers, who thought it to be too bold a change to the existing [[balance of power in international relations|balance-of-power]] structure.{{r|HistNet_01}} According to historian [[George Sanford (scholar)|George Sanford]], it was around 1920 that Pi\u0142sudski came to realize the infeasibility of that version of his Intermarium project.{{sfn|Sanford|2002|pp=5\u20136}}\n\nInstead of a Central and Eastern European alliance, there soon appeared a series of border conflicts, including the [[Polish-Ukrainian War]] (1918\u201319), the [[Polish-Lithuanian War]] (1920, culminating in [[\u017beligowski's Mutiny]]), [[Polish-Czechoslovak border conflicts]] (beginning in 1918), and most notably the Polish-Soviet War (1919\u201321).{{r|PWN}} [[Winston Churchill]] commented, \"The war of giants has ended, the wars of the pygmies begun.\"{{r|HydeP01_75}}\n\n==Polish\u2013Soviet War==\n[[File:Josef Pilsudski cph.3b35372.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Pi\u0142sudski around 1919]]\n{{Main|Polish\u2013Soviet War}}\n[[File:Jozef Pilsudski w Poznaniu.jpg|thumb|right|Pi\u0142sudski in [[Pozna\u0144]]]]\nIn the [[aftermath of World War I]], there was unrest on all Polish borders. Regarding Poland's future frontiers, Pi\u0142sudski said, \"All that we can gain in the west depends on the Entente\u2014on the extent to which it may wish to squeeze Germany\". In the east, \"there are doors that open and close, and it depends on who forces them open and how far\".{{r|McM03_211}} In 1918 in the east, Polish forces clashed with Ukrainian forces in the Polish\u2013Ukrainian War, and Pi\u0142sudski's first orders as Commander-in-Chief of the Polish Army, on 12 November 1918, were to provide support for the [[Battle of Lw\u00f3w (1918)|Polish struggle in Lviv]].{{r|Urbank97_281}}\n\nPi\u0142sudski was aware that the Bolsheviks were no friends of independent Poland and that war with them was inevitable.{{r|Urbank97_2_90}} He viewed their advance west as a major problem, but he also considered the Bolsheviks less dangerous for Poland than their [[White movement|White opponents]].{{r|Kenez99_37}} The \"White Russians\", representatives of the old Russian Empire, were willing to accept only limited independence for Poland, probably within borders similar to those of the former [[Congress Poland]], and they clearly objected to Polish control of Ukraine, which was crucial for Pi\u0142sudski's Intermarium project.{{r|Urbank97_2_83}}\n\nThat was in contrast to the Bolsheviks, who proclaimed the partitions of Poland null and void.{{r|Urbank97_291}} Pi\u0142sudski thus speculated that Poland would be better off with the Bolsheviks, alienated from the Western powers, than with a restored Russian Empire.{{r|Kenez99_37|Urbank97_2_45}} By ignoring the strong pressures from the [[Entente Cordiale]] to join the attack on Lenin's struggling Bolshevik government, Pi\u0142sudski probably saved it in the summer and the fall of 1919.{{r|Urbank97_2_92}}\n\n[[File:Jozef Pilsudski.jpg|thumb|left|upright|In March 1920, Pi\u0142sudski was made \"First [[Marshal of Poland]]\".]]\n\t\nIn the wake of the [[Russian westward offensive of 1918\u20131919]] and of a series of escalating battles that resulted in the Poles advancing eastward, on 21 April 1920, [[Marshal]] Pi\u0142sudski (as his rank had been since March 1920) signed a military alliance (the [[Treaty of Warsaw (1920)|Treaty of Warsaw]]) with Ukrainian leader [[Symon Petliura]] to conduct joint operations against [[Soviet Russia]]. The goal of the Polish-Ukrainian Treaty was to establish an independent Ukraine and independent Poland in alliance, resembling that once existing within [[Polish\u2013Lithuanian Commonwealth]]{{r|Davies03_95ff}} In return, Petliura gave up Ukrainian claims to western lands of [[Galicia (Central Europe)|Galicia]] being a historical part of the [[Crown of Poland]] for which he was denounced by Ukrainian nationalist leaders.{{r|Cienciala02}}\n\nThe Polish and the Ukrainian Armies, under Pi\u0142sudski's command, launched [[1920 Kiev Offensive|a successful offensive]] against the Russian forces in Ukraine.

Pi\u0142sudski, however, was a staunch advocate of continuing the fight.{{r|Urbank97_341\u20136}} As [[Norman Davies]] noted, at that time, especially abroad, \"Pi\u0142sudski had nothing of his later prestige. As a pre-war revolutionary he led his party to splits and quarrels; as a general in World War I he led his legions to internment and disbanding; as a marshal of the Polish Army he led it to Kiev and Vilnius, both now lost to Poles. He left the Polish Socialist Party and his Austro-German allies; refused to ally himself with Entente.

The plan next required two armies under General [[J\u00f3zef Haller de Hallenburg|J\u00f3zef Haller]], facing Soviet frontal attack on Warsaw from the east, to hold their [[trench|entrenched]] positions at all costs. At the same time, an army under General [[W\u0142adys\u0142aw Sikorski]] was to strike north from outside Warsaw, cutting off Soviet forces that sought to envelope the Polish capital from that direction. The most important role, however, was assigned to a relatively small, approximately 20,000-man, newly assembled \"Reserve Army\" (also known as the \"Strike Group\", \"''Grupa Uderzeniowa''\"), comprising the most determined, battle-hardened Polish units that were commanded personally by Pi\u0142sudski. Their task was to spearhead a lightning northward offensive, from the Vistula-Wieprz triangle south of Warsaw, through a weak spot that had been identified by Polish intelligence between the Soviet Western and Southwestern [[Front (Soviet Army)|Fronts]]. That offensive would separate the Soviet Western Front from its reserves and disorganize its movements. Eventually, the gap between Sikorski's army and the \"Strike Group\" would close near the [[East Prussia]]n border, bringing about the destruction of the encircled Soviet forces.{{r|Cisek02_1401|Urbank97_346-441_357-8}}\n\nAt the time, Pi\u0142sudski's plan was criticized, and only the desperate situation of the Polish forces persuaded other commanders to go along with it. Although based on reliable intelligence, including [[decryption|decrypted]] Soviet radio communications, the plan was termed \"amateurish\" by high-ranking army officers and military experts, quick to point out Pi\u0142sudski's lack of formal military education. After a copy of the plan fell into Soviet hands, Western Front commander [[Mikhail Tukhachevsky]] thought it to be a ruse and disregarded it.{{sfn|Davies|2003|p=197}} Days later, the Soviets paid dearly during the Battle of Warsaw, the overconfident [[Red Army]] suffered one of their worst defeats.{{r|Davies03_00|Urbank97_346-441_357-8}}\n\nA National Democrat ''[[Sejm]]'' deputy, [[Stanis\u0142aw Stro\u0144ski]], coined the phrase, \"Miracle at the Vistula\" (\"''Cud nad Wis\u0142\u0105''\"),{{r|G\u0142os05}} to express his disapproval of Pi\u0142sudski's \"Ukrainian adventure\".

From 1928, the Sanation authorities were represented in the sphere of practical politics by the [[Non-partisan Bloc for Cooperation with the Government]] (''BBWR'').

These two areas will be referred to as the ''encounter handshake'' and ''infection reporting'' respectively. Additionally authentication, notification, and other minor responsibilities of the protocol are defined.\n\n=== Authentication ===\nAuthentication during registration was a requirement to mitigate the malicious user adversary model. Without authentication, malicious users could create a potentially infinite number of false user accounts and use them to overload the system with relative ease.

The issue with exchanging static identifiers, such as the client's PUID, is that malicious third parties can observe encounters over time to establish patterns of individuals. For example, if a person had access to a network of Bluetooth receivers all over a city and the protocol made use of a static identifier, they could track where every user in that city traveled and correlate that data to potentially gain the identity of any given client. Thus, clients exchange time sensitive temporary IDs issued by the central server. In order to generate these temporary IDs, the central server generates a global secret key <math>BK_t</math>, which is used to calculate all temporary IDs for a short timeframe <math>t</math>. From this an Ephemeral Bluetooth ID (EBID) is calculated for each user with the algorithm <math>EBID_t(PUID)=AES(BK_t, PUID)</math> where <math>AES</math> is the [[Advanced Encryption Standard|AES encryption algorithm]]. These EBIDs are used by the clients as the temporary IDs in the exchange. EBIDs are fetched in forward dated batches to account for poor internet access.\n\nClients then constantly broadcast their EBID under the PEPP-PT Bluetooth service identifier, while also scanning for other clients. If another client is found, the two exchange and log EBIDs, along with metadata about the encounter such as the signal strength and a timestamp.\n\n=== Infection reporting ===\nWhen a user, out of band, has been confirmed positive for infection the patient is asked to upload their contact logs to the central reporting server. If the user consents, the health authority issues a key authorizing the upload. The user then transmits the contact log over [[HTTPS]] to the reporting server to be processed.\n\nOnce the reporting server has received a contact log, each entry is run through a proximity check algorithm to reduce the likelihood of false positives. Once the list of users who have come in close contact with the infected patients is confirmed, they, along with a random sample of other users, are sent a message containing a random number and message hash. This message serves to wake up the client and have them check the server for new reports. If the client is on the list of confirmed users, the server will confirm potential infection to the client which will in turn warn the user. If a client is in the random sample, it will receive a response with no meaning. The reason a random sample of users is sent a message for every report is so that eavesdroppers are not able to determine who is at risk for infection by listening to communication between the client and server.\n\n== Controversy ==\nThe PEPP-PT project has been subject to a range of controversy since its public announcement. \n\nOn 17 April, a group of 12 [[Member of the European Parliament|MEPs]] from the [[Renew Europe]] group wrote a letter to Hans-Christian Boos of PEPP-PT, asking why the group 'has so far not been transparent on the functioning of the contact tracing apps', as well as why PEPP-PT had released no open source code.[https://twitter.com/SophieintVeld/status/1251221787192578048]\n\nThe [[Helmholtz Association of German Research Centres|Helmholtz Center for Information Security (CISPA)]] confirmed in a press release on April 20 2020 that it was withdrawing from the consortium, citing a 'lack of transparency and clear governance' as well as data protection concerns around the PEPP-PT design.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cispa.saarland/2020/04/20/contact-tracing-app-for-the-sars-cov-2-pandemic.html|title=Contact Tracing App for the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic|last=sebastian.kloeckner|date=2020-04-20|website=Helmholtz Center for Information Security (CISPA)|language=en|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref> The [[\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne]], [[ETH Zurich]], [[KU Leuven]] and the [[Institute for Scientific Interchange]] withdrew from the project in the same week.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.tagesspiegel.de/wissen/welche-technologie-soll-es-sein-das-gefaehrliche-chaos-um-die-corona-app/25755338.html|title=Das gef\u00e4hrliche Chaos um die Corona-App|website=www.tagesspiegel.de|language=de|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref><ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.spiegel.de/netzwelt/apps/pepp-pt-in-corona-krise-den-tracing-app-entwicklern-laufen-die-partner-weg-a-017f50eb-c1e2-4097-8182-53708ca6db59|title=Projekt Pepp-PT: Den Tracing-App-Entwicklern laufen die Partner weg - DER SPIEGEL - Netzwelt|last=SPIEGEL|first=DER|website=www.spiegel.de|language=de|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref><ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.zeit.de/zustimmung?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.zeit.de%2Fdigital%2Fdatenschutz%2F2020-04%2Fcorona-app-initiative-pepp-pt-datenschutz-warnung-forscher|title=ZEIT ONLINE {{!}} Lesen Sie zeit.de mit Werbung oder imPUR-Abo.

If the user consents, the health authority issues a key authorizing the upload. The user then transmits the contact log over [[HTTPS]] to the reporting server to be processed.\n\nOnce the reporting server has received a contact log, each entry is run through a proximity check algorithm to reduce the likelihood of false positives. Once the list of users who have come in close contact with the infected patients is confirmed, they, along with a random sample of other users, are sent a message containing a random number and message hash. This message serves to wake up the client and have them check the server for new reports. If the client is on the list of confirmed users, the server will confirm potential infection to the client which will in turn warn the user. If a client is in the random sample, it will receive a response with no meaning. The reason a random sample of users is sent a message for every report is so that eavesdroppers are not able to determine who is at risk for infection by listening to communication between the client and server.\n\n== Controversy ==\nThe PEPP-PT project has been subject to a range of controversy since its public announcement. \n\nOn 17 April, a group of 12 [[Member of the European Parliament|MEPs]] from the [[Renew Europe]] group wrote a letter to Hans-Christian Boos of PEPP-PT, asking why the group 'has so far not been transparent on the functioning of the contact tracing apps', as well as why PEPP-PT had released no open source code.[https://twitter.com/SophieintVeld/status/1251221787192578048]\n\nThe [[Helmholtz Association of German Research Centres|Helmholtz Center for Information Security (CISPA)]] confirmed in a press release on April 20 2020 that it was withdrawing from the consortium, citing a 'lack of transparency and clear governance' as well as data protection concerns around the PEPP-PT design.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://cispa.saarland/2020/04/20/contact-tracing-app-for-the-sars-cov-2-pandemic.html|title=Contact Tracing App for the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic|last=sebastian.kloeckner|date=2020-04-20|website=Helmholtz Center for Information Security (CISPA)|language=en|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref> The [[\u00c9cole Polytechnique F\u00e9d\u00e9rale de Lausanne]], [[ETH Zurich]], [[KU Leuven]] and the [[Institute for Scientific Interchange]] withdrew from the project in the same week.<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.tagesspiegel.de/wissen/welche-technologie-soll-es-sein-das-gefaehrliche-chaos-um-die-corona-app/25755338.html|title=Das gef\u00e4hrliche Chaos um die Corona-App|website=www.tagesspiegel.de|language=de|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref><ref name=\":3\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.spiegel.de/netzwelt/apps/pepp-pt-in-corona-krise-den-tracing-app-entwicklern-laufen-die-partner-weg-a-017f50eb-c1e2-4097-8182-53708ca6db59|title=Projekt Pepp-PT: Den Tracing-App-Entwicklern laufen die Partner weg - DER SPIEGEL - Netzwelt|last=SPIEGEL|first=DER|website=www.spiegel.de|language=de|access-date=2020-04-20}}</ref><ref name=\":4\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.zeit.de/zustimmung?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.zeit.de%2Fdigital%2Fdatenschutz%2F2020-04%2Fcorona-app-initiative-pepp-pt-datenschutz-warnung-forscher|title=ZEIT ONLINE {{!}} Lesen Sie zeit.de mit Werbung oder imPUR-Abo.

The censors were extremely likely to monitor and block posts that were \"tending towards action\" within the country, in order to prevent uprisings or protests.

[[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIS]] is a prominent group that has utilized the power and range of social media as a means of broadcasting their \u201cinvasions\u201d to reach different demographics, a skill seen primarily in the ISIS invasion of Iraq. ISIS began their invasion of Iraq in 2014, primarily focused on the acquisition of the city of Mosul. Approximately 1,500 ISIS fighters entered Northern Iraq, a fact known through their continuous broadcast on various social media platforms. This particular use of social media quickly sparked a global conversation surrounding the weaponization of social media as a fear tactic.

This \u201ccontagion of fear\u201d resulted in approximately 30,000 Iraqi soldiers, along with the vast majority of Mosul\u2019s population, to flee, resulting in what has been referred to as ISIS\u2019s \u201cpropaganda victory.\u201d The ability of organizations to rewrite their personal narratives and manufacture a picture of defeat for national armed forces is quickly shifting the construct of the battlefield and the ways in which war is conducted and fought.  \n\n==== Russia ====\nIn order to insulate their citizens from outside news sources, Russia created their own, monitored internet in the country. To do so, the state blocked and delegitimized news outlets that held opposing thoughts to their Prime Minister, [[Vladimir Putin]], as well as the ideas within his party.

Originally, the Japanese government started with securitization over a 15 year period by implementing different security systems within their internet. However, as internet has been used more within the military, the Japanese government turned towards militarization. To do so, the government assigned three specifics tasks to three different sections of the military. The National Police Agency prosecutes cyberattacks that are seen as crimes, the Japanese Military of Defense is responsible for the state's networks, and the National Security Bureau of the NPA which, in conjunction with the Defense Intelligence Headquarters, divide specific intelligence issues.The Crisis Management Center, the Cabinet Intelligence Research Office, and the National Information Security Center. All of these groups work together, within Japan's government, to regulate what is seen on the internet, whether it be outside content or political differences within the country. From 2015 onward, especially with the Tokyo 2021 Olympics, internet militarization has become an integral part of the country's overall approach to state security.  <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kallender|first=Paul|last2=Hughes|first2=Christopher W.|date=2017-01-02|title=Japan\u2019s Emerging Trajectory as a \u2018Cyber Power\u2019: From Securitization to Militarization of Cyberspace|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01402390.2016.1233493|journal=Journal of Strategic Studies|language=en|volume=40|issue=1-2|pages=118\u2013145|doi=10.1080/01402390.2016.1233493|issn=0140-2390}}</ref>\n\n==== United States of America ====\nThe invention of ARPAnet was a U.S.response to the Soviet creation of [[Sputnik 1|Sputnik]] in 1957.

This \"parallel internet\" while not completely insular, allows the government to screen what is seen by its citizens, as well as gives them the ability to shut down the government when threatened with an internet attack. <ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.pcmag.com/news/russia-is-about-to-disconnect-from-the-internet-what-that-means|title=Russia Is About to Disconnect From the Internet: What That Means|website=PCMAG|language=en|access-date=2020-04-18}}</ref>\n<br />\n\n== National Security Case Studies ==\n\n==== Japan ====\nJapan started to revitalize their militarization of cyberspace after a series of online attacks from January 2000-2010, with these attacks escalating until 2015. Originally, the Japanese government started with securitization over a 15 year period by implementing different security systems within their internet. However, as internet has been used more within the military, the Japanese government turned towards militarization. To do so, the government assigned three specifics tasks to three different sections of the military. The National Police Agency prosecutes cyberattacks that are seen as crimes, the Japanese Military of Defense is responsible for the state's networks, and the National Security Bureau of the NPA which, in conjunction with the Defense Intelligence Headquarters, divide specific intelligence issues.The Crisis Management Center, the Cabinet Intelligence Research Office, and the National Information Security Center. All of these groups work together, within Japan's government, to regulate what is seen on the internet, whether it be outside content or political differences within the country. From 2015 onward, especially with the Tokyo 2021 Olympics, internet militarization has become an integral part of the country's overall approach to state security.  <ref>{{Cite journal|last=Kallender|first=Paul|last2=Hughes|first2=Christopher W.|date=2017-01-02|title=Japan\u2019s Emerging Trajectory as a \u2018Cyber Power\u2019: From Securitization to Militarization of Cyberspace|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/01402390.2016.1233493|journal=Journal of Strategic Studies|language=en|volume=40|issue=1-2|pages=118\u2013145|doi=10.1080/01402390.2016.1233493|issn=0140-2390}}</ref>\n\n==== United States of America ====\nThe invention of ARPAnet was a U.S.response to the Soviet creation of [[Sputnik 1|Sputnik]] in 1957.

Simon P. Newman, p. 163.</ref>\n| country = United States\n}}\nThe '''Federalist Party''' was the first [[political party in the United States]]. Under [[Alexander Hamilton]], it dominated the national government from 1789 to 1801. It became a minority  party while keeping its stronghold in [[New England]] and made a brief resurgence by opposing the [[War of 1812]]. It then collapsed with its last presidential candidate in 1816. Remnants lasted in a few places for a few years. The party appealed to businesses and to conservatives who favored banks, national over state government, manufacturing, an army and navy, and in world affairs preferred [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] and opposed the [[French Revolution]].\n\nThe Federalists called for a strong national government that promoted economic growth and fostered friendly relationships with Great Britain in opposition to Revolutionary France. It controlled the federal government until 1801, when it was overwhelmed by the [[Democratic-Republican]] opposition led by [[Thomas Jefferson]]. The Federalist Party came into being between 1792 and 1794 as a national coalition of bankers and businessmen in support of Hamilton's fiscal policies. These supporters worked in every state to build an organized party committed to a fiscally sound and nationalistic government. The only Federalist President was [[John Adams]]. [[George Washington]] was broadly sympathetic to the Federalist program, but he remained officially non-partisan during his entire presidency.<ref name=\"Chambers, 1963\">Chambers, William Nisbet (1963). ''Political Parties in a New Nation''.</ref>\n\nFederalist policies called for a national bank, tariffs and good relations with Great Britain as expressed in the [[Jay Treaty]] negotiated in 1794. Hamilton developed the concept of [[implied powers]] and successfully argued the adoption of that interpretation of the Constitution. Their political opponents, the Democratic-Republicans led by Jefferson, denounced most of the Federalist policies, especially the bank and implied powers; and vehemently attacked the Jay Treaty as a sell-out of [[Republicanism in the United States|republican values]] to the British monarchy. The Jay Treaty passed and the Federalists won most of the major legislative battles in the 1790s. They held a strong base in the nation's cities and in New England. They factionalized when President Adams secured peace with France, to the anger of Hamilton's larger faction. After the Jeffersonians, whose base was in the rural South and West, won the hard-fought [[1800 United States presidential election|presidential election of 1800]], the Federalists never returned to power. They recovered some strength through their intense opposition to the War of 1812, but they practically vanished during the [[Era of Good Feelings]] that followed the end of the war in 1815.<ref>Wood, Gordon S. (2009). ''Empire of Liberty: A History of the Early Republic, 1789\u20131815''.</ref>\n\nThe Federalists left a lasting legacy in the form of a strong Federal government with a sound financial base. After losing executive power, they decisively shaped [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] policy for another three decades through Chief Justice [[John Marshall]].<ref>Formisano, 2001.</ref>\n\n== Rise ==\nOn taking office in 1790, President Washington nominated his wartime chief of staff [[Alexander Hamilton]] to the new office of [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Secretary of the Treasury]]. Hamilton wanted a strong national government with financial credibility. Hamilton proposed the ambitious [[Hamiltonian economic program]] that involved assumption of the state debts incurred during the American Revolution, creating a [[national debt]] and the means to pay it off and setting up a national bank, along with creating tariffs, with Madison playing major roles in the program. Parties were considered to be divisive and harmful to [[Republicanism in the United States|republicanism]]. No similar parties existed anywhere in the world.<ref name=\"Chambers\" /> \nBy 1790, Hamilton started building a nationwide coalition. Realizing the need for vocal political support in the states, he formed connections with like-minded nationalists and used his network of treasury agents to link together friends of the government, especially merchants and bankers, in the new nation's dozen major cities. His attempts to manage politics in the national capital to get his plans through Congress brought strong responses across the country. In the process, what began as a capital faction soon assumed status as a national faction and then as the new Federalist Party.<ref>Chambers, William Nisbet (1963). ''Parties in a New Nation''. pp. 39\u201340.</ref> The Federalist Party supported Hamilton's vision of a strong centralized government and agreed with his proposals for a national bank and heavy government subsidies. In foreign affairs, they supported [[Proclamation of Neutrality|neutrality]] in the [[French Revolutionary Wars|war]] between France and Great Britain.<ref>Miller, John C. (1960). ''The Federalist Era 1789\u20131801''. pp 210\u2013228.</ref>\n\n[[File:Alexander Hamilton portrait by John Trumbull 1806.jpg|thumb|A portrait of [[Alexander Hamilton]] by [[John Trumbull]], 1806]]\nThe majority of the Founding Fathers were originally Federalists. Alexander Hamilton, James Madison and many others can all be considered Federalists. These Federalists felt that the [[Articles of Confederation]] had been too weak to sustain a working government and had decided that a new form of government was needed. Hamilton was made Secretary of the Treasury and when he came up with the idea of funding the debt he created a split in the original Federalist group. Madison greatly disagreed with Hamilton not just on this issue, but on many others as well and he and [[John J. Beckley]] created the Anti-Federalist faction. These men would form the Republican Party under Thomas Jefferson.<ref>Miller, John C. (1960). ''The Federalist Era 1789\u20131801''. pp 84\u201398.</ref>\n\nBy the early 1790s, newspapers started calling Hamilton supporters \"Federalists\" and their opponents \"Democrats\", \"Republicans\", \"Jeffersonians\", or\u2014much later\u2014\"Democratic-Republicans\". Jefferson's supporters usually called themselves \"Republicans\" and their party the \"Republican Party\".<ref>After 1793\u2013174, with the Terror in the French Revolution, \"Democrat\" became a negative term until the middle of Madison's presidency and the Federalists continued to use it to describe their opponents.

''Jefferson''. 3:162.</ref> The Federalist Party became popular with businessmen and New Englanders as Republicans were mostly farmers who opposed a strong central government. Cities were usually Federalist strongholds whereas frontier regions were heavily Republican. However, these are generalizations as there are special cases such as the Presbyterians of upland North Carolina, who had immigrated just before the Revolution and often been Tories, became Federalists.<ref>Manning J. Dauer, ''The Adams Federalists'', chapter 2.</ref> The [[Congregationalism in the United States|Congregationalists]] of New England and the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopalians]] in the larger cities supported the Federalists while other minority denominations tended toward the Republican camp. Catholics in Maryland were generally Federalists.<ref>Renzulli, L. Marx (1973). ''Maryland: The Federalist Years. p 142, 183, 295.</ref>\n\nThe state networks of both parties began to operate in 1794 or 1795. [[Patronage#Politics|Patronage]] now became a factor. The [[Plurality voting system|winner-takes-all]] election system opened a wide gap between winners, who got all the patronage; and losers, who got none. Hamilton had many lucrative Treasury jobs to dispense\u2014there were 1,700 of them by 1801.<ref>White, Leonard D. (1948). ''The Federalists. A Study in Administrative History''. p 123.</ref>  Jefferson had one part-time job in the State Department, which he gave to journalist [[Philip Freneau]] to attack the Federalists. In New York, [[George Clinton (vice president)|George Clinton]] won the election for [[Governor of New York|governor]] and used the vast state patronage fund to help the Republican cause.\n\nWashington tried and failed to moderate the feud between his two top cabinet members.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Miller, ''The Federalist Era 1789\u20131801'' (1960).</ref> He was re-elected without opposition in [[U.S. presidential election, 1792|1792]]. The Democratic-Republicans nominated New York's Governor Clinton to replace Federalist [[John Adams]] as Vice President, but Adams won. The balance of power in Congress was close, with some members still undecided between the parties. In early 1793, Jefferson secretly prepared resolutions introduced by [[William Branch Giles]], Congressman from Virginia, designed to repudiate Hamilton and weaken the Washington Administration.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 2947173|title = Thomas Jefferson and the Giles Resolutions|journal = The William and Mary Quarterly|volume = 49|issue = 4|pages = 589\u2013608|last1 = Sheridan|first1 = Eugene R.|year = 1992|doi = 10.2307/2947173}}</ref> Hamilton defended his administration of the nation's complicated financial affairs, which none of his critics could decipher until the arrival in Congress of the Republican [[Albert Gallatin]] in 1793.\n\nFederalists counterattacked by claiming the Hamiltonian program had restored national prosperity as shown in one 1792 anonymous newspaper essay:<ref>''The Gazette of United States'', September 5, 1792 in Beard, Charles A. (1915). ''Economic Origins of Jeffersonian Democracy''. p. 231.</ref> <blockquote>To what physical, moral, or political energy shall this flourishing state of things be ascribed? There is but one answer to these inquiries: Public credit is restored and established. The general government, by uniting and calling into action the pecuniary resources of the states, has created a new capital stock of several millions of dollars, which, with that before existing, is directed into every branch of business, giving life and vigor to industry in its infinitely diversified operation. The enemies of the general government, the funding act and the National Bank may bellow tyranny, aristocracy, and speculators through the Union and repeat the clamorous din as long as they please; but the actual state of agriculture and commerce, the peace, the contentment and satisfaction of the great mass of people, give the lie to their assertions.</blockquote>\n\nJefferson wrote on February 12, 1798: {{quote|Two political Sects have arisen within the U. S. the one believing that the executive is the branch of our government which the most needs support; the other that like the analogous branch in the English Government, it is already too strong for the republican parts of the Constitution; and therefore in equivocal cases they incline to the legislative powers: the former of these are called federalists, sometimes aristocrats or monocrats, and sometimes tories, after the corresponding sect in the English Government of exactly the same definition: the latter are stiled republicans, whigs, jacobins, anarchists, disorganizers, etc. these terms are in familiar use with most persons.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 1833690|title = A Letter of Jefferson on the Political Parties, 1798|journal = The American Historical Review|volume = 3|issue = 3|pages = 488\u2013489|year = 1898|doi = 10.2307/1833690}}</ref>}}\n\n=== Religious dimension ===\nIn New England, the Federalist Party was closely linked to the Congregational church.

The King had been decisive in helping the United States achieve independence, but now he was dead and many of the pro-American aristocrats in France were exiled or executed. Federalists warned that American republicans threatened to replicate the horrors of the French Revolution and successfully mobilized most conservatives and many clergymen. The Republicans, some of whom had been strong Francophiles, responded with support even through the [[Reign of Terror]], when thousands were guillotined, though it was at this point that many began backing away from their pro-France leanings.<ref>Elkins and McKitrick pp. 314\u201316 on Jefferson's favorable responses.</ref> Many of those executed had been friends of the United States, such as the [[Charles Hector, comte d'Estaing|Comte D'Estaing]], whose fleet had fought alongside the Americans in the Revolution ([[Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de La Fayette|Lafayette]] had already fled into exile, and [[Thomas Paine]] went to prison in France). The republicans denounced Hamilton, Adams and even Washington as friends of Britain, as secret [[monarchism|monarchists]] and as enemies of the republican values. The level of rhetoric reached a fever pitch.<ref>Marshall Smelser, \"The Federalist Period as an Age of Passion,\" ''American Quarterly'' 10 (Winter 1958), 391\u2013459.</ref><ref name = \"Smelser\">Smelser, \"The Jacobin Phrenzy: Federalism and the Menace of Liberty, Equality and Fraternity,\" ''Review of Politics'' 13 (1951) 457\u201382.</ref>\n\nIn 1793, Paris sent a new minister, [[Edmond-Charles Gen\u00eat]] (known as ''Citizen Gen\u00eat''), who systematically mobilized pro-French sentiment and encouraged Americans to support France's war against Britain and Spain. Gen\u00eat funded local [[Democratic-Republican Societies]] that attacked Federalists.<ref>Elkins and McKitrick, ''Age of Federalism'', pp 451\u201361</ref> He hoped for a favorable new treaty and for repayment of the debts owed to France. Acting aggressively, Gen\u00eat outfitted [[privateer]]s that sailed with American crews under a French flag and attacked British shipping. He tried to organize expeditions of Americans to invade Spanish Louisiana and Spanish Florida. When Secretary of State Jefferson told Gen\u00eat he was pushing American friendship past the limit, Gen\u00eat threatened to go over the government's head and rouse public opinion on behalf of France. Even Jefferson agreed this was blatant foreign interference in domestic politics. Gen\u00eat's extremism seriously embarrassed the Jeffersonians and cooled popular support for promoting the French Revolution and getting involved in its wars. Recalled to Paris for execution, Gen\u00eat kept his head and instead went to New York, where he became a citizen and married the daughter of Governor Clinton.<ref>Eugene R. Sheridan,  \"The Recall of Edmond Charles Genet: A Study in Transatlantic Politics and Diplomacy\".

Some of these issues dated to the Revolution, such as boundaries, debts owed in each direction and the continued presence of British forts in the [[Northwest Ordinance|Northwest Territory]]. In addition, the United States hoped to open markets in the British Caribbean and end disputes stemming from the naval war between Britain and France. Most of all the goal was to avert a war with Britain\u2014a war opposed by the Federalists, that some historians claim the Jeffersonians wanted.<ref>Elkins and McKitrick, pp. 375\u2013406.</ref>\n\nAs a neutral party, the United States argued it had the right to carry goods anywhere it wanted. The British nevertheless seized American ships carrying goods from the [[French West Indies]]. The Federalists favored Britain in the war and by far most of America's foreign trade was with Britain, hence a new treaty was called for. The British agreed to evacuate the western forts, open their West Indies ports to American ships, allow small vessels to trade with the French West Indies and set up a commission that would adjudicate American claims against Britain for seized ships and British claims against Americans for debts incurred before 1775. One possible alternative was war with Britain, a war that the United States was ill-prepared to fight.<ref>Elkins and McKitrick, pp. 406\u201350.</ref>\n\nThe republicans wanted to pressure Britain to the brink of war (and assumed that the United States could defeat a weak Britain).<ref>Miller (1960) p. 149.</ref> Therefore, they denounced the Jay Treaty as an insult to American prestige, a repudiation of the American-French alliance of 1777 and a severe shock to Southern planters who owed those old debts and who were never to collect for the lost slaves the British captured. Republicans protested against the treaty and organized their supporters. The Federalists realized they had to mobilize their popular vote, so they mobilized their newspapers, held rallies, counted votes and especially relied on the prestige of President Washington. The contest over the Jay Treaty marked the first flowering of grassroots political activism in the United States, directed and coordinated by two national parties. Politics was no longer the domain of politicians as every voter was called on to participate. The new strategy of appealing directly to the public worked for the Federalists as public opinion shifted to support the Jay Treaty.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 3125063|title = Shaping the Politics of Public Opinion: Federalists and the Jay Treaty Debate|journal = Journal of the Early Republic|volume = 20|issue = 3|pages = 393\u2013422|last1 = Estes|first1 = Todd|year = 2000|doi = 10.2307/3125063}}</ref> The Federalists controlled the Senate and they ratified it by exactly the necessary \u2154 vote (20\u201310) in 1795. However, the republicans did not give up and public opinion swung toward the republicans after the Treaty fight and in the South the Federalists lost most of the support they had among planters.<ref>Sharp 113\u201337.</ref>\n\n== Whiskey Rebellion ==\n{{Main|Whiskey Rebellion}}\nThe [[excise tax]] of 1791 caused grumbling from the frontier including threats of [[tax resistance]]. Corn, the chief crop on the frontier, was too bulky to ship over the mountains to market unless it was first distilled into whiskey. This was profitable as the United States population consumed per capita relatively large quantities of liquor. After the excise tax, the backwoodsmen complained the tax fell on them rather than on the consumers. Cash poor, they were outraged that they had been singled out to pay off the \"financiers and speculators\" back in the East and to pay the salaries of the federal revenue officers who began to swarm the hills looking for illegal stills.<ref>Miller (1960) pp. 155\u201362</ref>\n\nInsurgents in western Pennsylvania shut the courts and hounded federal officials, but Jeffersonian leader [[Albert Gallatin]] mobilized the western moderates and thus forestalled a serious outbreak. Washington, seeing the need to assert federal supremacy, called out 13,000 state militia and marched toward [[Washington, Pennsylvania]] to suppress this [[Whiskey Rebellion]]. The rebellion evaporated in late 1794 as Washington approached, personally leading the army (only two sitting Presidents have directly led American military forces, Washington during the Whiskey Rebellion and Madison in an attempt to save the White House during the [[War of 1812]]). The rebels dispersed and there was no fighting. Federalists were relieved that the new government proved capable of overcoming rebellion while Republicans, with Gallatin their new hero, argued there never was a real rebellion and the whole episode was manipulated in order to accustom Americans to a [[standing army]].\n\nAngry petitions flowed in from three dozen [[Democratic-Republican Societies]] created by Citizen Gen\u00eat. Washington attacked the societies as illegitimate and many disbanded. Federalists now ridiculed Republicans as \"democrats\" (meaning in favor of [[Ochlocracy|mob rule]]) or \"[[Jacobins]]\" (a reference to the [[Reign of Terror]] in France).\n\nWashington refused to run for a third term, establishing a two-term precedent that was to stand until 1940 and eventually to be enshrined in the Constitution as the [[Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution|22nd Amendment]]. He warned in his [[Washington's Farewell Address|Farewell Address]] against involvement in European wars and lamented the rising north\u2013south sectionalism and party spirit in politics that threatened national unity: <blockquote>The party spirits serves always to distract the Public Councils, and enfeeble the Public Administration. It agitates the Community with ill-founded jealousies and false alarms; kindles the animosity of one part against another, foments occasionally riot and insurrection. It opens the door to foreign influence and corruption, which find a facilitated access to the government itself through the channels of party passions. Thus the policy and the will of one country are subjected to the policy and will of another.</blockquote>\n\nWashington never considered himself a member of any party, but broadly supported most Federalist policies.<ref>{{cite web|title=History of the Federal Judiciary|url=http://www.fjc.gov/history/home.nsf/page/tu_sedbio_fr.html}}</ref>\n\n== Newspaper editors at war ==\nThe [[spoils system]] helped finance Federalist printers until 1801 and Republican editors after that. Federalist [[United States Postmaster General|Postmasters General]], [[Timothy Pickering]] (1791\u201394) and [[Joseph Habersham]] (1795\u20131801) appointed and removed local [[postmaster]]s to maximize party funding. Numerous printers were appointed as postmasters. They did not deliver the mail, but they did collect fees from mail users and obtained free delivery of their own newspapers and business mail.<ref>Carl E.

Bache in particular targeted Washington himself as the front man for monarchy who must be exposed. To Bache, Washington was a cowardly general and a money-hungry baron who saw the Revolution as a means to advance his fortune and fame; Adams was a failed diplomat who never forgave the French their love of [[Benjamin Franklin]] and who craved a crown for himself and his descendants; and Alexander Hamilton was the most inveterate monarchist of them all.<ref>Donald H. Stewart, ''The Opposition Press of the Federalist Period'' (1969)</ref>\n\nThe Federalists, with twice as many newspapers at their command, slashed back with equal vituperation. [[John Fenno]] and \"Peter Porcupine\" ([[William Cobbett]]) were their nastiest penmen and [[Noah Webster]] their most learned. Hamilton subsidized the Federalist editors, wrote for their papers and in 1801 established his own paper, the ''[[New York Post|New York Evening Post]].'' Though his reputation waned considerably following his death, [[Joseph Dennie]] ran three of the most popular and influential newspapers of the period, ''The Farmer's Weekly Museum'', the ''[[Gazette of the United States]]'' and ''[[The Port Folio]]''.<ref>{{cite book |last=Lora |first=Ronald |title=The Conservative Press in Eighteenth-and Nineteenth-century America  |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fRpKaRzq6OMC&pg=PA103&lpg=PA103&dq=The+Farmer%27s+Weekly+Museum |publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing Group]] |year=1999 |pages=103\u2013111 |isbn=0-313-31043-2}}</ref>\n\n=== Ceremonies and civil religion ===\n[[File:Apotheosis of George Washington.jpg|thumb|''The Apotheosis of Washington'' as seen looking up from the Capitol rotunda in Washington, D.C.]]\nThe Federalists were conscious of the need to boost voter identification with their party.

George Washington was always their hero and after his death he became viewed as a sort of demigod looking down from heaven to bestow his blessings on the party. At first, the Federalists focused on commemorating the [[Ratification of the United States Constitution|ratification of the Constitution]] and organized parades to demonstrate widespread popular support for the new Federalist Party. The parade organizers incorporated secular versions of traditional religious themes and rituals, thereby fostering a highly visible celebration of the nation's new civil religion.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 41178897|title = The Federal Processions of 1788 and the Origins of American Civil Religion|journal = Soundings: An Interdisciplinary Journal|volume = 77|issue = 3/4|pages = 367\u2013387|last1 = Heideking|first1 = J\u00fcrgen|year = 1994}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Independence Day (United States)|Fourth of July]] became a semi-sacred day\u2014a status has maintained for much of American history.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://time.com/2951223/fourth-of-july-god-religion-america/|title=The Theology of the Fourth of July|website=Time|language=en|access-date=2020-03-16}}</ref> Its celebration in Boston emphasized national over local patriotism and included orations, dinners, militia musters, parades, marching bands, floats and fireworks. By 1800, the Fourth of July was closely identified with the Federalist Party. Republicans were annoyed and staged their own celebrations on the same day\u2014with rival parades sometimes clashing with each other, which generated even more excitement and larger crowds. After the collapse of the Federalists starting in 1815, the Fourth of July became a nonpartisan holiday.<ref>Len Travers, \"Hurrah for the Fourth: Patriotism, Politics, and Independence Day in Federalist Boston, 1783\u20131818.\" ''Essex Institute Historical Collections'' 125: 129\u2013161.</ref><ref>Kevin Coe, et al.

The [[1796 United States presidential election|election of 1796]] was the first partisan affair in the nation's history and one of the more scurrilous in terms of newspaper attacks. Adams swept New England and Jefferson the South, with the middle states leaning to Adams. Adams was the winner by a margin of three [[United States Electoral College|electoral votes]] and Jefferson, as the runner-up, became Vice President under the system set out in the Constitution prior to the ratification of the [[Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution|12th Amendment]].<ref>Bernard A. Weisberger, ''America afire: Jefferson, Adams, and the first contested election'' (Perennial, 2001).</ref>\n\nThe Federalists were strongest in New England, but also had strengths in the middle states. They elected Adams as President in 1796, when they controlled both houses of Congress, the presidency, eight state legislatures and ten governorships.<ref>Philip J. Lampi, \"The Federalist Party Resurgence, 1808\u20131816: Evidence from the New Nation Votes Database.\" ''Journal of the Early Republic'' 33.2 (2013): 255\u2013281.</ref>\n\nForeign affairs continued to be the central concern of American politics, for the war raging in Europe threatened to drag in the United States. The new President was a loner, who made decisions without consulting Hamilton or other \"High Federalists\". Benjamin Franklin once quipped that Adams was a man always honest, often brilliant and sometimes mad. Adams was popular among the Federalist rank and file, but had neglected to build state or local political bases of his own and neglected to take control of his own cabinet. As a result, his cabinet answered more to Hamilton than to himself. Hamilton was especially popular because he rebuilt the Army\u2014and had commissions to give out.<ref>Richard H. Kohn, ''Eagle and sword: The Federalists and the creation of the military establishment in America, 1783\u20131802'' (1975).</ref>\n\n=== Alien and Sedition Acts ===\nAfter an American delegation was insulted in Paris in the [[XYZ affair]] (1797), public opinion ran strongly against the French. An undeclared \"[[Quasi-War]]\" with France from 1798 to 1800 saw each side attacking and capturing the other's shipping. It was called \"quasi\" because there was no declaration of war, but escalation was a serious threat. At the peak of their popularity, the Federalists took advantage by preparing for an invasion by the French Army. To silence Administration critics, the Federalists passed the [[Alien and Sedition Acts]] in 1798. The Alien Act empowered the President to deport such aliens as he declared to be dangerous. The Sedition Act made it a crime to print false, scandalous and malicious criticisms of the federal government, but it conspicuously failed to criminalize criticism of Vice President Thomas Jefferson.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 1898365|title = President John Adams, Thomas Cooper, and Sedition: A Case Study in Suppression|journal = The Mississippi Valley Historical Review|volume = 42|issue = 3|pages = 438\u2013465|last1 = Smith|first1 = James Morton|year = 1955|doi = 10.2307/1898365}}</ref>\n\nSeveral Republican newspaper editors were convicted under the Act and fined or jailed and three Democratic-Republican newspapers were shut down.<ref>Marc A. Franklin, David A. Anderson, & Lyrissa Barnett Lidsky, ''Mass Media Law'' (7th ed. 2005).</ref> In response, Jefferson and Madison secretly wrote the [[Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions]] passed by the two states' legislatures that declared the Alien and Sedition Acts unconstitutional and insisted the states had the power to [[Nullification (U.S. Constitution)|nullify]] federal laws.\n\nUndaunted, the Federalists created a [[United States Navy|navy]], with new [[frigate]]s; and a large new army, with Washington in nominal command and Hamilton in actual command. To pay for it all, they raised taxes on land, houses and slaves, leading to serious unrest. In one part of Pennsylvania, the [[John Fries's Rebellion|Fries' Rebellion]] broke out, with people refusing to pay the new taxes. John Fries was sentenced to death for treason, but received a pardon from Adams. In the elections of 1798, the Federalists did very well, but this issue started hurting the Federalists in 1799. Early in 1799, Adams decided to free himself from Hamilton's overbearing influence, stunning the country and throwing his party into disarray by announcing a new peace mission to France. The mission eventually succeeded, the \"Quasi-War\" ended and the new army was largely disbanded. Hamiltonians called Adams a failure while Adams fired Hamilton's supporters still in the cabinet.\n\nHamilton and Adams intensely disliked one another and the Federalists split between supporters of Hamilton (\"High Federalists\") and supporters of Adams. Hamilton became embittered over his loss of political influence and wrote a scathing criticism of Adams' performance as President in an effort to throw Federalist support to [[Charles Cotesworth Pinckney]]. Inadvertently, this split the Federalists and helped give the victory to Jefferson.<ref name=\"Manning Dauer 1953\">Manning Dauer, ''The Adams Federalists'' (Johns Hopkins UP, 1953).</ref>\n\n== Election of 1800 ==\n{{main|United States presidential election, 1800}}\nAdams's peace moves proved popular with the Federalist rank and file and he seemed to stand a good chance of re-election in 1800. If the [[Three-Fifths Compromise]] had not been enacted, he most likely would have won reelection since many Federalist legislatures removed the right to select electors from their constituents in fear of a Democratic victory. Jefferson was again the opponent and Federalists pulled out all stops in warning that he was a dangerous revolutionary, hostile to religion, who would weaken the government, damage the economy and get into war with Britain. Many believed that if Jefferson won the election, it would be the end of the newly formed United States. The Republicans crusaded against the Alien and Sedition laws as well as the new taxes and proved highly effective in mobilizing popular discontent.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nThe election hinged on New York as its [[United States Electoral College|electors]] were selected by the [[New York State Legislature|legislature]] and given the balance of North and South, they would decide the presidential election. [[Aaron Burr]] brilliantly organized his forces in New York City in the spring elections for the state legislature. By a few hundred votes, he carried the city\u2014and thus the state legislature\u2014and guaranteed the election of a Republican President. As a reward, he was selected by the Republican [[caucus]] in Congress as their vice presidential candidate. Alexander Hamilton, knowing the election was lost anyway, went public with a sharp attack on Adams that further divided and weakened the Federalists.<ref>Brian Phillips Murphy, \"' A Very Convenient Instrument': The Manhattan Company, Aaron Burr, and the Election of 1800.\" ''William and Mary Quarterly'' 65.2 (2008): 233\u2013266.</ref>\n\nMembers of the Republican Party planned to vote evenly for Jefferson and Burr because they did not want for it to seem as if their party was divided. The party took the meaning literally and Jefferson and Burr tied in the election with 73 electoral votes. This sent the election to the House of Representatives to break the tie. The Federalists had enough weight in the House to swing the election in either direction. Many would rather have seen Burr in the office over Jefferson, but Hamilton, who had a strong dislike of Burr, threw his political weight behind Jefferson. During the election, neither Jefferson nor Burr attempted to swing the election in the House of Representatives. Jefferson remained at Monticello to oversee the laying of bricks to a section of his home. Jefferson allowed for his political beliefs and other ideologies to filter out through letters to his contacts. Thanks to Hamilton's support, Jefferson would win the election and Burr would become his Vice President. Many Federalists held to the belief that this was the end of the United States and that the experiment they had begun had ended in failure.<ref>Miller, John C. \"The Federalist Era 1789\u20131801\" (1960)</ref> This unintended complication led directly to the proposal and ratification of the [[Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution|12th Amendment]]. \"We are all republicans\u2014we are all federalists\", proclaimed Jefferson in his [[United States presidential inauguration|inaugural address]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/124/pres16.html|title=Thomas Jefferson: First Inaugural Address. U.S. Inaugural Addresses. 1989|publisher=}}</ref> This election marked the first time power had been transferred between opposing political parties, an act that occurred remarkably without bloodshed. Though there had been strong words and disagreements, contrary to the Federalists fears, there was no war and no ending of one-government system to let in a new one. His patronage policy was to let the Federalists disappear through attrition. Those Federalists such as [[John Quincy Adams]] (John Adams' own son) and [[Rufus King]] willing to work with him were rewarded with senior diplomatic posts, but there was no punishment of the opposition.<ref>Susan Dunn, ''Jefferson's second revolution: The Election Crisis of 1800 and the Triumph of Republicanism'' (2004)</ref>\n\n== Federalists in opposition ==\n[[Fisher Ames]] (1758\u20131808) of Massachusetts ranks as one of the more influential figures of his era.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 985426|title = Fisher Ames, Spokesman for New England Federalism|journal = Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society|volume = 103|issue = 5|pages = 693\u2013715|last1 = Douglass|first1 = Elisha P.|year = 1959}}</ref> Ames led Federalist ranks in the House of Representatives. His acceptance of the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]] garnered support in Massachusetts for the new Constitution. His greatest fame came as an orator who defined the principles of the Federalist Party and the follies of the Republicans. Ames offered one of the first great speeches in American Congressional history when he spoke in favor of the [[Jay Treaty]]. Ames was part of Hamilton's faction and cautioned against the excesses of democracy unfettered by morals and reason: \"Popular reason does not always know how to act right, nor does it always act right when it knows\".<ref>Russell Kirk, ''The Conservative Mind: From Burke to Eliot'' (2001). p. 83</ref> He warned his countrymen of the dangers of flattering demagogues, who incite dis-union and lead their country into bondage: \"Our country is too big for union, too sordid for patriotism, too democratic for liberty. What is to become of it, He who made it best knows. Its vice will govern it, by practising upon its folly. This is ordained for democracies\".<ref>Fisher Ames, letter of October 26, 1803, Works, p. 483. As cited in Kirk, ''The Conservative Mind''  p. 83.</ref>\n\n=== Jefferson administration ===\n{{main|Thomas Jefferson}}\n[[File:Official Presidential portrait of Thomas Jefferson (by Rembrandt Peale, 1800).jpg|thumb|President [[Thomas Jefferson]]]]\nJefferson had a very successful first term, typified by the [[Louisiana Purchase]], which was ironically supported by Hamilton, but opposed by most Federalists at the time as unconstitutional. Some Federalist leaders ([[Essex Junto]]) began courting Jefferson's Vice President and Hamilton's nemesis Aaron Burr in an attempt to swing New York into an independent confederation with the New England states, which along with New York were supposed to secede from the United States after Burr's election to Governor. However, Hamilton's influence cost Burr the governorship of New York, a key in the Essex Junto's plan, just as Hamilton's influence had cost Burr the presidency nearly four years before. Hamilton's thwarting of Aaron Burr's ambitions for the second time was too much for Burr to bear. Hamilton had known of the Essex Junto (whom Hamilton now regarded as apostate Federalists) and Burr's plans and opposed them vehemently. This opposition by Hamilton would lead to his fatal duel with Burr in July 1804.<ref>David H. Fischer, \"The Myth of the Essex Junto.\" ''William and Mary Quarterly'' (1964): 191\u2013235.</ref>\n\nThe thoroughly disorganized Federalists hardly offered any opposition to Jefferson's reelection in 1804 and Federalists seemed doomed. Jefferson had taken away most of their patronage, including federal judgeships. The party now controlled only five state legislatures and seven governorships. After again losing the presidency in 1804, the party was now down to three legislatures and five governorships (four in New England). Their majorities in Congress were long gone, dropping in the Senate from 23 and 1796, 218 and 1800 to only six in 1804.<ref>Lampi, \"The Federalist Party Resurgence,\" p 259</ref> In New England and in some districts in the middle states, the Federalists clung to power, but the tendency from 1800 to 1812 was steady slippage almost everywhere as the Republicans perfected their organization and the Federalists tried to play catch-up. Some younger leaders tried to emulate the Democratic-Republican tactics, but their overall disdain of democracy along with the upper class bias of the party leadership eroded public support. In the South, the Federalists steadily lost ground everywhere.<ref name=\"Manning Dauer 1953\"/>\n\nThe Federalists continued for several years to be a major political party in New England and the Northeast, but never regained control of the presidency or the Congress. With the death of Washington and Hamilton and the retirement of Adams, the Federalists were left without a strong leader as [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[John Marshall]] stayed out of politics. However, a few younger leaders did appear, notably [[Daniel Webster]]. Federalist policies favored factories, banking and trade over agriculture and therefore became unpopular in the growing Western states. They were increasingly seen as aristocratic and unsympathetic to democracy. In the South, the party had lingering support in Maryland, but elsewhere was crippled by 1800 and faded away by 1808.<ref name = \"GBooks\">[https://books.google.com/books?ie=UTF-8&hl=en&vid=ISBN1570033870&id=AFS3Uu_EMQEC&dq=%22james+Monroe%22+%22republican+party%22+caucus&prev=https://books.google.com/books%3Fq%3D%2522james%2BMonroe%2522%2B%2522republican%2Bparty%2522%2Bcaucus%26lr%3D%26start%3D10&lpg=PA110&pg=PA112&sig=WOeJgA_A4A0qE0orXMCnXaX6nYQ Google Books].</ref>\n\nMassachusetts and Connecticut remained the party strongholds. Historian Richard J. Purcell explains how well organized the party was in Connecticut:\n<blockquote>It was only necessary to perfect the working methods of the organized body of office-holders who made up the nucleus of the party. There were the state officers, the assistants, and a large majority of the Assembly. In every county there was a sheriff with his deputies. All of the state, county, and town judges were potential and generally active workers. Every town had several justices of the peace, school directors and, in Federalist towns, all the town officers who were ready to carry on the party's work. Every parish had a \"standing agent,\" whose anathemas were said to convince at least ten voting deacons. Militia officers, state's attorneys, lawyers, professors and schoolteachers were in the van of this \"conscript army.\" In all, about a thousand or eleven hundred dependent officer-holders were described as the inner ring which could always be depended upon for their own and enough more votes within their control to decide an election. This was the Federalist machine.<ref>Richard J. Purcell, ''Connecticut in Transition: 1775\u20131818'' 1963. p. 190.</ref></blockquote>\n\nAfter 1800, the major Federalist role came in the judiciary. Although Jefferson managed to repeal the [[Judiciary Act of 1801]] and thus dismissed many lower level Federalist federal judges, the effort to impeach Supreme Court Justice [[Samuel Chase]] in 1804 failed. Led by the last great Federalist, [[John Marshall]] as Chief Justice from 1801 to 1835, the Supreme Court carved out a unique and powerful role as the protector of the Constitution and promoter of nationalism.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 844519|title = The Jeffersonian Assault on the Federalist Judiciary, 1802-1805; Political Forces and Press Reaction|journal = The American Journal of Legal History|volume = 14|issue = 1|pages = 55\u201375|last1 = Knudson|first1 = Jerry W.|year = 1970|doi = 10.2307/844519}}</ref>\n\n=== Anti-war party ===\nAs the wars in Europe intensified, the United States became increasingly involved. The Federalists restored some of their strength by leading the anti-war opposition to Jefferson and Madison between 1807 and 1814. President Jefferson imposed an embargo on Britain in 1807 as the [[Embargo Act of 1807]] prevented all American ships from sailing to a foreign port. The idea was that the British were so dependent on American supplies that they would come to terms. For 15 months, the Embargo wrecked American export businesses, largely based in the Boston-New York region, causing a sharp depression in the Northeast. Evasion was common and Jefferson and Treasury Secretary Gallatin responded with tightened police controls more severe than anything the Federalists had ever proposed. Public opinion was highly negative and a surge of support breathed fresh life into the Federalist Party.<ref>Lampi, \"The Federalist Party Resurgence,\"</ref>\n\nThe Republicans nominated Madison for the presidency in 1808. Meeting in the first-ever national convention, Federalists considered the option of nominating Jefferson's Vice President [[George Clinton (vice president)|George Clinton]] as their own candidate, but balked at working with him and again chose [[Charles Cotesworth Pinckney]], their 1804 candidate. Madison lost New England excluding Vermont, but swept the rest of the country and carried a Republican Congress. Madison dropped the Embargo, opened up trade again and offered a carrot and stick approach. If either France or Britain agreed to stop their violations of American neutrality, the United States would cut off trade with the other country. Tricked by Napoleon into believing France had acceded to his demands, Madison turned his wrath on Britain and the [[War of 1812]] began.<ref>James M. Banner, ''To the Hartford Convention: The Federalists and the origins of party politics in Massachusetts, 1789\u20131815'' (1970).</ref> Young Daniel Webster, running for Congress from New Hampshire in 1812, first gained overnight fame with his anti-war speeches.<ref>Kenneth E. Shewmaker, '\"This Unblessed War': Daniel Webster's Opposition to the War of 1812\" ''Historical New Hampshire'' 53#1 (1998) pp 21\u201345</ref>\n\n=== Madison administration ===\n{{main|James Madison}}\n[[File:James Madison.jpg|thumb|President [[James Madison]]]]\nThe nation was at war during the [[1812 United States presidential election|1812 presidential election]] and war was the burning issue. Opposition to the war was strong in traditional Federalist strongholds in New England and New York, where the party made a comeback in the elections of 1812 and 1814. In their second national convention in 1812, the Federalists, now the peace party, nominated [[DeWitt Clinton]], the dissident Republican [[Mayor of New York City]] and an articulate opponent of the war. Madison ran for reelection promising a relentless war against Britain and an honorable peace. Clinton, denouncing Madison's weak leadership and incompetent preparations for war, could count on New England and New York. To win, he needed the middle states and there the campaign was fought out. Those states were competitive and had the best-developed local parties and most elaborate campaign techniques, including nominating conventions and formal [[party platform]]s. The [[Tammany Hall|Tammany Society]] in New York City highly favored Madison and the Federalists finally adopted the club idea in 1808. Their [[Washington Benevolent Societies]] were semi-secret membership organizations which played a critical role in every northern state as they held meetings and rallies and mobilized Federalist votes.<ref>William Alexander Robinson, \"The Washington Benevolent Society in New England: a phase of politics during the War of 1812\", ''Proceedings of the Massachusetts Historical Society'' (1916) vol 49 pp 274ff.</ref> New Jersey went for Clinton, but Madison carried Pennsylvania and thus was reelected with 59% of the electoral votes. However, the Federalists gained 14 seats in Congress.\n\n== Opposition to the War of 1812 ==\nThe [[War of 1812]] went poorly for the Americans for two years. Even though Britain was concentrating its military efforts on its [[Napoleonic Wars|war with]] [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]], the United States still failed to make any headway on land and was effectively blockaded at sea by the [[Royal Navy]]. The British raided and burned [[Washington, D.C.]] in 1814 and sent a force to capture New Orleans.\n\nThe war was especially unpopular in New England. The New England economy was highly dependent on trade and the British blockade threatened to destroy it entirely. In 1814, the British Navy finally managed to enforce their blockade on the New England coast, so the Federalists of New England sent delegates to the [[Hartford Convention]] in December 1814.\n\nDuring the proceedings of the Hartford Convention, secession from the Union was discussed, though the resulting report listed a set of grievances against the Democratic-Republican federal government and proposed [[Hartford Convention#Convention report|a set of Constitutional amendments to address these grievances]]. They demanded financial assistance from Washington to compensate for lost trade and proposed constitutional amendments requiring a two-thirds vote in Congress before an embargo could be imposed, new states admitted, or war declared. It also indicated that if these proposals were ignored, then another convention should be called and given \"such powers and instructions as the exigency of a crisis may require\". The Federalist Massachusetts Governor had already secretly sent word to England to broker a separate peace accord. Three Massachusetts \"ambassadors\" were sent to Washington to negotiate on the basis of this report.\n\nBy the time the Federalist \"ambassadors\" got to Washington, the war was over and news of [[Andrew Jackson]]'s stunning victory in the [[Battle of New Orleans]] had raised American morale immensely. The \"ambassadors\" hastened back to Massachusetts, but not before they had done fatal damage to the Federalist Party. The Federalists were thereafter associated with the disloyalty and parochialism of the Hartford Convention and destroyed as a political force. Across the nation, Republicans used the great victory at New Orleans to ridicule the Federalists as cowards, defeatists and secessionists. Pamphlets, songs, newspaper editorials, speeches and entire plays on the Battle of New Orleans drove home the point.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 42628249|title = \"It Taught our Enemies a Lesson:\" the Battle of New Orleans and the Republican Destruction of the Federalist Party|journal = Tennessee Historical Quarterly|volume = 71|issue = 2|pages = 112\u2013127|last1 = Stoltz|first1 = Joseph F.|year = 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe Federalists fielded their last presidential candidate ([[Rufus King]]) in [[U.S. presidential election, 1816|1816]]. With the party's passing, partisan hatreds and newspaper feuds declined and the nation entered the \"[[Era of Good Feelings]]\". As late as 1822 the Federalists controlled the [[Massachusetts Senate]]. After the dissolution of the [[18th United States Congress|final Federalist congressional caucus]] in 1825, the last traces of Federalist activity came in Delaware and Massachusetts local politics in the late 1820s. As late as 1828, the party won control of the [[Delaware General Assembly|Delaware state legislature]]. In 1829 [[Harrison Gray Otis (politician)|Harrison Gray Otis]] was elected [[Mayor of Boston]] and became the last major Federalist office holder.\n\n== Interpretations ==\nIntellectually, Federalists were profoundly devoted to [[Republicanism in the United States|liberty]]. As [[Samuel Eliot Morison]] explained, they believed that liberty is inseparable from union, that men are essentially unequal, that ''vox populi'' (\"voice of the people\") is seldom if ever ''vox Dei'' (\"the voice of God\") and that sinister outside influences are busy undermining American integrity.<ref>Samuel Eliot Morison, ''Harrison Gray Otis, 1765\u20131848: the urbane Federalist'' (2nd ed. 1969) pages x\u2013xi</ref> Oxford-trained British historian [[Patrick Allitt]] concludes that Federalists promoted many positions that would form the baseline for later American conservatism, including the rule of law under the Constitution, republican government, peaceful change through elections, judicial supremacy, stable national finances, credible and active diplomacy and protection of wealth.<ref>Patrick Allitt, ''The Conservatives'' (2009) p 26</ref>\n\nIn terms of \"classical conservatism\", the Federalists had no [[wikt:have truck with|truck with]] European-style aristocracy, monarchy, or established religion. Historian [[John P. Diggins]] says: \"Thanks to the framers, American conservatism began on a genuinely lofty plane. James Madison, Alexander Hamilton, John Marshall, John Jay, James Wilson, and, above all, John Adams aspired to create a republic in which the values so precious to conservatives  might flourish: harmony, stability, virtue, reverence, veneration, loyalty, self-discipline, and moderation. This was classical conservatism in its most authentic expression\".<ref name=\"Diggins\"/>\n\nThe Federalists were dominated by businessmen and merchants in the major cities who supported a strong national government. The party was closely linked to the modernizing, urbanizing, financial policies of Alexander Hamilton. These policies included the funding of the national debt and also assumption of state debts incurred during the Revolutionary War, the incorporation of a national [[First Bank of the United States|Bank of the United States]], the support of manufactures and industrial development, and the use of a tariff to fund the Treasury. In foreign affairs, the Federalists opposed the French Revolution, engaged in the \"[[Quasi War]]\" (an undeclared naval war) with France in 1798\u201399, sought good relations with Britain and sought a strong army and navy. Ideologically, the controversy between Republicans and Federalists stemmed from a difference of principle and style. In terms of style, the Federalists feared mob rule, thought an educated elite should represent the general populace in national governance and favored national power over state power. Republicans distrusted Britain, bankers, merchants and did not want a powerful national government. The Federalists, notably Hamilton, were distrustful of \"the people\", the French and the Republicans.<ref>Chernow (2004)</ref> In the end, the nation synthesized the two positions, adopting representative democracy and a strong nation state. Just as importantly, American politics by the 1820s accepted the two-party system whereby rival parties stake their claims before the electorate and the winner takes control of majorities in state legislatures and the Congress and gains governorships and the presidency.\n\nAs time went on, the Federalists lost appeal with the average voter and were generally not equal to the tasks of party organization; hence they grew steadily weaker as the political triumphs of the Republican Party grew.<ref>Shaw Livermore, Jr., ''The Twilight of Federalism: The Disintegration of the Federalist Party 1815\u20131830'' (1962)</ref> For economic and philosophical reasons, the Federalists tended to be pro-British\u2014the United States engaged in more trade with [[Great Britain]] than with any other country\u2014and vociferously opposed Jefferson's Embargo Act of 1807 and the seemingly deliberate provocation of war with Britain by the Madison Administration. During \"Mr. Madison's War\", as they called it, the Federalists made a temporary comeback.<ref>{{cite book |author=Robert Vincent Remini|title=Daniel Webster: The Man and His Time|url=https://archive.org/details/danielwebsterman00remi|url-access=registration|year=1997|publisher=W.

They had some local support in New England, New York, eastern Pennsylvania, Maryland and Delaware. After the collapse of the Federalist Party in the course of the [[U.S. presidential election, 1824|1824 presidential election]], most surviving Federalists (including Daniel Webster) joined former Republicans like [[Henry Clay]] to form the [[National Republican Party (United States)|National Republican Party]], which was soon combined with other anti-Jackson groups to form the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]] in 1833. By then, nearly all remaining Federalists joined the Whigs. However, some former Federalists like [[James Buchanan]], [[Louis McLane]] and [[Roger B. Taney]] became Jacksonian Democrats.<ref>{{cite book |author=Lynn Parsons|title=The Birth of Modern Politics : Andrew Jackson, John Quincy Adams, and the Election of 1828: Andrew Jackson, John Quincy Adams, and the Election of 1828|url=https://archive.org/details/birthofmodernpol00lynn|url-access=registration|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=[https://archive.org/details/birthofmodernpol00lynn/page/164 164]|isbn=9780199718504}}</ref>\n\nThe \"Old Republicans\", led by [[John Randolph of Roanoke]], refused to form a coalition with the Federalists and instead set up a separate opposition since Jefferson, Madison, Gallatin, Monroe, [[John C. Calhoun]] and Clay had in effect adopted Federalist principles of [[implied powers]] to purchase the Louisiana Territory and after the failures and lessons of the War of 1812 raised tariffs to protect factories, chartered the Second National Bank, promoted a strong army and navy and promoted [[internal improvements]]. All these measures were opposed to the [[Strict constructionism|strict construction]] of the Constitution, which was the formal basis of the Republicans, but the drift of the party to support them could not be checked. It was aided by the Supreme Court, whose influence under John Marshall as a nationalizing factor now first became apparent. The whole change reconciled the Federalists to their absorption into the Republican Party. Indeed, they claimed, with considerable show of justice, that the absorption was in the other direction: that the Republicans had recanted and that the \"Washington-Monroe policy\", as they termed it after 1820, was all that Federalists had ever desired.<ref>John Joseph Lalor. ''[[Cyclopedia of Political Science|Cyclopedia of Political Science, Political Economy, and the Political History of the United States]]'' (1881).</ref>\n\nThe name \"Federalist\" came increasingly to be used in political rhetoric as a term of abuse and was denied by the Whigs, who pointed out that their leader Henry Clay was the Republican Party leader in Congress during the 1810s.<ref>Hans Sperber and Travis Trittschuh. ''American Political Terms: An Historical Dictionary'' (1962). p. 150.</ref>\n\nThe Federalists had a weak base in the South, with their main base in the Northeast and especially New England. It was the reverse for the Republicans. As a result, anti-slavery elements were largely based in the Federalist Party. Several leading Federalists, most notably John Jay and Alexander Hamilton, were leaders of the anti-slavery movement. They led the successful battles to abolish the international slave trade in New York City and the battle to abolish slavery in the state of New York.<ref>Paul Finkelman,\"Federalist Party\" in Robert A.

Simon P. Newman, p. 163.</ref>\n| country = United States\n}}\nThe '''Federalist Party''' was the first [[political party in the United States]]. Under [[Alexander Hamilton]], it dominated the national government from 1789 to 1801. It became a minority  party while keeping its stronghold in [[New England]] and made a brief resurgence by opposing the [[War of 1812]]. It then collapsed with its last presidential candidate in 1816. Remnants lasted in a few places for a few years. The party appealed to businesses and to conservatives who favored banks, national over state government, manufacturing, an army and navy, and in world affairs preferred [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] and opposed the [[French Revolution]].\n\nThe Federalists called for a strong national government that promoted economic growth and fostered friendly relationships with Great Britain in opposition to Revolutionary France. It controlled the federal government until 1801, when it was overwhelmed by the [[Democratic-Republican]] opposition led by [[Thomas Jefferson]]. The Federalist Party came into being between 1792 and 1794 as a national coalition of bankers and businessmen in support of Hamilton's fiscal policies. These supporters worked in every state to build an organized party committed to a fiscally sound and nationalistic government. The only Federalist President was [[John Adams]]. [[George Washington]] was broadly sympathetic to the Federalist program, but he remained officially non-partisan during his entire presidency.<ref name=\"Chambers, 1963\">Chambers, William Nisbet (1963). ''Political Parties in a New Nation''.</ref>\n\nFederalist policies called for a national bank, tariffs and good relations with Great Britain as expressed in the [[Jay Treaty]] negotiated in 1794. Hamilton developed the concept of [[implied powers]] and successfully argued the adoption of that interpretation of the Constitution. Their political opponents, the Democratic-Republicans led by Jefferson, denounced most of the Federalist policies, especially the bank and implied powers; and vehemently attacked the Jay Treaty as a sell-out of [[Republicanism in the United States|republican values]] to the British monarchy. The Jay Treaty passed and the Federalists won most of the major legislative battles in the 1790s. They held a strong base in the nation's cities and in New England. They factionalized when President Adams secured peace with France, to the anger of Hamilton's larger faction. After the Jeffersonians, whose base was in the rural South and West, won the hard-fought [[1800 United States presidential election|presidential election of 1800]], the Federalists never returned to power. They recovered some strength through their intense opposition to the War of 1812, but they practically vanished during the [[Era of Good Feelings]] that followed the end of the war in 1815.<ref>Wood, Gordon S. (2009). ''Empire of Liberty: A History of the Early Republic, 1789\u20131815''.</ref>\n\nThe Federalists left a lasting legacy in the form of a strong Federal government with a sound financial base. After losing executive power, they decisively shaped [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] policy for another three decades through Chief Justice [[John Marshall]].<ref>Formisano, 2001.</ref>\n\n== Rise ==\nOn taking office in 1790, President Washington nominated his wartime chief of staff [[Alexander Hamilton]] to the new office of [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Secretary of the Treasury]]. Hamilton wanted a strong national government with financial credibility. Hamilton proposed the ambitious [[Hamiltonian economic program]] that involved assumption of the state debts incurred during the American Revolution, creating a [[national debt]] and the means to pay it off and setting up a national bank, along with creating tariffs, with Madison playing major roles in the program. Parties were considered to be divisive and harmful to [[Republicanism in the United States|republicanism]]. No similar parties existed anywhere in the world.,<ref name=\"Chambers\" /> \nBy 1790, Hamilton started building a nationwide coalition. Realizing the need for vocal political support in the states, he formed connections with like-minded nationalists and used his network of treasury agents to link together friends of the government, especially merchants and bankers, in the new nation's dozen major cities. His attempts to manage politics in the national capital to get his plans through Congress brought strong responses across the country. In the process, what began as a capital faction soon assumed status as a national faction and then as the new Federalist Party.<ref>Chambers, William Nisbet (1963). ''Parties in a New Nation''. pp. 39\u201340.</ref> The Federalist Party supported Hamilton's vision of a strong centralized government and agreed with his proposals for a national bank and heavy government subsidies. In foreign affairs, they supported [[Proclamation of Neutrality|neutrality]] in the [[French Revolutionary Wars|war]] between France and Great Britain.<ref>Miller, John C. (1960). ''The Federalist Era 1789\u20131801''. pp 210\u2013228.</ref>\n\n[[File:Alexander Hamilton portrait by John Trumbull 1806.jpg|thumb|A portrait of [[Alexander Hamilton]] by [[John Trumbull]], 1806]]\nThe majority of the Founding Fathers were originally Federalists. Alexander Hamilton, James Madison and many others can all be considered Federalists. These Federalists felt that the [[Articles of Confederation]] had been too weak to sustain a working government and had decided that a new form of government was needed. Hamilton was made Secretary of the Treasury and when he came up with the idea of funding the debt he created a split in the original Federalist group. Madison greatly disagreed with Hamilton not just on this issue, but on many others as well and he and [[John J. Beckley]] created the Anti-Federalist faction. These men would form the Republican Party under Thomas Jefferson.<ref>Miller, John C. (1960). ''The Federalist Era 1789\u20131801''. pp 84\u201398.</ref>\n\nBy the early 1790s, newspapers started calling Hamilton supporters \"Federalists\" and their opponents \"Democrats\", \"Republicans\", \"Jeffersonians\", or\u2014much later\u2014\"Democratic-Republicans\". Jefferson's supporters usually called themselves \"Republicans\" and their party the \"Republican Party\".<ref>After 1793\u2013174, with the Terror in the French Revolution, \"Democrat\" became a negative term until the middle of Madison's presidency and the Federalists continued to use it to describe their opponents. Dahl, Robert A. (2005). \"James Madison: Republican or Democrat?\". ''Perspectives on Politics''. 3#3: 439\u2013448. Malone, Dumas. ''Jefferson''. 3:162.</ref> The Federalist Party became popular with businessmen and New Englanders as Republicans were mostly farmers who opposed a strong central government. Cities were usually Federalist strongholds whereas frontier regions were heavily Republican. However, these are generalizations as there are special cases such as the Presbyterians of upland North Carolina, who had immigrated just before the Revolution and often been Tories, became Federalists.<ref>Manning J. Dauer, ''The Adams Federalists'', chapter 2.</ref> The [[Congregationalism in the United States|Congregationalists]] of New England and the [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopalians]] in the larger cities supported the Federalists while other minority denominations tended toward the Republican camp. Catholics in Maryland were generally Federalists.<ref>Renzulli, L. Marx (1973). ''Maryland: The Federalist Years. p 142, 183, 295.</ref>\n\nThe state networks of both parties began to operate in 1794 or 1795. [[Patronage#Politics|Patronage]] now became a factor. The [[Plurality voting system|winner-takes-all]] election system opened a wide gap between winners, who got all the patronage; and losers, who got none. Hamilton had many lucrative Treasury jobs to dispense\u2014there were 1,700 of them by 1801.<ref>White, Leonard D. (1948). ''The Federalists. A Study in Administrative History''. p 123.</ref>  Jefferson had one part-time job in the State Department, which he gave to journalist [[Philip Freneau]] to attack the Federalists. In New York, [[George Clinton (vice president)|George Clinton]] won the election for [[Governor of New York|governor]] and used the vast state patronage fund to help the Republican cause.\n\nWashington tried and failed to moderate the feud between his two top cabinet members.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">Miller, ''The Federalist Era 1789\u20131801'' (1960).</ref> He was re-elected without opposition in [[U.S. presidential election, 1792|1792]]. The Democratic-Republicans nominated New York's Governor Clinton to replace Federalist [[John Adams]] as Vice President, but Adams won. The balance of power in Congress was close, with some members still undecided between the parties. In early 1793, Jefferson secretly prepared resolutions introduced by [[William Branch Giles]], Congressman from Virginia, designed to repudiate Hamilton and weaken the Washington Administration.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 2947173|title = Thomas Jefferson and the Giles Resolutions|journal = The William and Mary Quarterly|volume = 49|issue = 4|pages = 589\u2013608|last1 = Sheridan|first1 = Eugene R.|year = 1992|doi = 10.2307/2947173}}</ref> Hamilton defended his administration of the nation's complicated financial affairs, which none of his critics could decipher until the arrival in Congress of the Republican [[Albert Gallatin]] in 1793.\n\nFederalists counterattacked by claiming the Hamiltonian program had restored national prosperity as shown in one 1792 anonymous newspaper essay:<ref>''The Gazette of United States'', September 5, 1792 in Beard, Charles A. (1915). ''Economic Origins of Jeffersonian Democracy''. p. 231.</ref> <blockquote>To what physical, moral, or political energy shall this flourishing state of things be ascribed? There is but one answer to these inquiries: Public credit is restored and established. The general government, by uniting and calling into action the pecuniary resources of the states, has created a new capital stock of several millions of dollars, which, with that before existing, is directed into every branch of business, giving life and vigor to industry in its infinitely diversified operation. The enemies of the general government, the funding act and the National Bank may bellow tyranny, aristocracy, and speculators through the Union and repeat the clamorous din as long as they please; but the actual state of agriculture and commerce, the peace, the contentment and satisfaction of the great mass of people, give the lie to their assertions.</blockquote>\n\nJefferson wrote on February 12, 1798: {{quote|Two political Sects have arisen within the U. S. the one believing that the executive is the branch of our government which the most needs support; the other that like the analogous branch in the English Government, it is already too strong for the republican parts of the Constitution; and therefore in equivocal cases they incline to the legislative powers: the former of these are called federalists, sometimes aristocrats or monocrats, and sometimes tories, after the corresponding sect in the English Government of exactly the same definition: the latter are stiled republicans, whigs, jacobins, anarchists, disorganizers, etc. these terms are in familiar use with most persons.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 1833690|title = A Letter of Jefferson on the Political Parties, 1798|journal = The American Historical Review|volume = 3|issue = 3|pages = 488\u2013489|year = 1898|doi = 10.2307/1833690}}</ref>}}\n\n=== Religious dimension ===\nIn New England, the Federalist Party was closely linked to the Congregational church.

The King had been decisive in helping the United States achieve independence, but now he was dead and many of the pro-American aristocrats in France were exiled or executed. Federalists warned that American republicans threatened to replicate the horrors of the French Revolution and successfully mobilized most conservatives and many clergymen. The Republicans, some of whom had been strong Francophiles, responded with support even through the [[Reign of Terror]], when thousands were guillotined, though it was at this point that many began backing away from their pro-France leanings.<ref>Elkins and McKitrick pp. 314\u201316 on Jefferson's favorable responses.</ref> Many of those executed had been friends of the United States, such as the [[Charles Hector, comte d'Estaing|Comte D'Estaing]], whose fleet had fought alongside the Americans in the Revolution ([[Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de La Fayette|Lafayette]] had already fled into exile, and [[Thomas Paine]] went to prison in France). The republicans denounced Hamilton, Adams and even Washington as friends of Britain, as secret [[monarchism|monarchists]] and as enemies of the republican values. The level of rhetoric reached a fever pitch.<ref>Marshall Smelser, \"The Federalist Period as an Age of Passion,\" ''American Quarterly'' 10 (Winter 1958), 391\u2013459.</ref><ref name = \"Smelser\">Smelser, \"The Jacobin Phrenzy: Federalism and the Menace of Liberty, Equality and Fraternity,\" ''Review of Politics'' 13 (1951) 457\u201382.</ref>\n\nIn 1793, Paris sent a new minister, [[Edmond-Charles Gen\u00eat]] (known as ''Citizen Gen\u00eat''), who systematically mobilized pro-French sentiment and encouraged Americans to support France's war against Britain and Spain. Gen\u00eat funded local [[Democratic-Republican Societies]] that attacked Federalists.<ref>Elkins and McKitrick, ''Age of Federalism'', pp 451\u201361</ref> He hoped for a favorable new treaty and for repayment of the debts owed to France. Acting aggressively, Gen\u00eat outfitted [[privateer]]s that sailed with American crews under a French flag and attacked British shipping. He tried to organize expeditions of Americans to invade Spanish Louisiana and Spanish Florida. When Secretary of State Jefferson told Gen\u00eat he was pushing American friendship past the limit, Gen\u00eat threatened to go over the government's head and rouse public opinion on behalf of France. Even Jefferson agreed this was blatant foreign interference in domestic politics. Gen\u00eat's extremism seriously embarrassed the Jeffersonians and cooled popular support for promoting the French Revolution and getting involved in its wars. Recalled to Paris for execution, Gen\u00eat kept his head and instead went to New York, where he became a citizen and married the daughter of Governor Clinton.<ref>Eugene R. Sheridan,  \"The Recall of Edmond Charles Genet: A Study in Transatlantic Politics and Diplomacy\". ''Diplomatic History'' 18#4 (1994), 463\u201368.</ref> Jefferson left office, ending the coalition cabinet and allowing the Federalists to dominate.<ref>Elkins and McKitrick, pp. 330\u201365.</ref>\n\n=== Jay Treaty ===\nThe [[Jay Treaty]] battle in 1794\u20131795 was the effort by Washington, Hamilton and [[John Jay]] to resolve numerous difficulties with Britain. Some of these issues dated to the Revolution, such as boundaries, debts owed in each direction and the continued presence of British forts in the [[Northwest Ordinance|Northwest Territory]]. In addition, the United States hoped to open markets in the British Caribbean and end disputes stemming from the naval war between Britain and France. Most of all the goal was to avert a war with Britain\u2014a war opposed by the Federalists, that some historians claim the Jeffersonians wanted.<ref>Elkins and McKitrick, pp. 375\u2013406.</ref>\n\nAs a neutral party, the United States argued it had the right to carry goods anywhere it wanted. The British nevertheless seized American ships carrying goods from the [[French West Indies]]. The Federalists favored Britain in the war and by far most of America's foreign trade was with Britain, hence a new treaty was called for. The British agreed to evacuate the western forts, open their West Indies ports to American ships, allow small vessels to trade with the French West Indies and set up a commission that would adjudicate American claims against Britain for seized ships and British claims against Americans for debts incurred before 1775. One possible alternative was war with Britain, a war that the United States was ill-prepared to fight.<ref>Elkins and McKitrick, pp. 406\u201350.</ref>\n\nThe republicans wanted to pressure Britain to the brink of war (and assumed that the United States could defeat a weak Britain).<ref>Miller (1960) p. 149.</ref> Therefore, they denounced the Jay Treaty as an insult to American prestige, a repudiation of the American-French alliance of 1777 and a severe shock to Southern planters who owed those old debts and who were never to collect for the lost slaves the British captured. Republicans protested against the treaty and organized their supporters. The Federalists realized they had to mobilize their popular vote, so they mobilized their newspapers, held rallies, counted votes and especially relied on the prestige of President Washington. The contest over the Jay Treaty marked the first flowering of grassroots political activism in the United States, directed and coordinated by two national parties. Politics was no longer the domain of politicians as every voter was called on to participate. The new strategy of appealing directly to the public worked for the Federalists as public opinion shifted to support the Jay Treaty.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 3125063|title = Shaping the Politics of Public Opinion: Federalists and the Jay Treaty Debate|journal = Journal of the Early Republic|volume = 20|issue = 3|pages = 393\u2013422|last1 = Estes|first1 = Todd|year = 2000|doi = 10.2307/3125063}}</ref> The Federalists controlled the Senate and they ratified it by exactly the necessary \u2154 vote (20\u201310) in 1795.

Corn, the chief crop on the frontier, was too bulky to ship over the mountains to market unless it was first distilled into whiskey. This was profitable as the United States population consumed per capita relatively large quantities of liquor. After the excise tax, the backwoodsmen complained the tax fell on them rather than on the consumers. Cash poor, they were outraged that they had been singled out to pay off the \"financiers and speculators\" back in the East and to pay the salaries of the federal revenue officers who began to swarm the hills looking for illegal stills.<ref>Miller (1960) pp. 155\u201362</ref>\n\nInsurgents in western Pennsylvania shut the courts and hounded federal officials, but Jeffersonian leader [[Albert Gallatin]] mobilized the western moderates and thus forestalled a serious outbreak. Washington, seeing the need to assert federal supremacy, called out 13,000 state militia and marched toward [[Washington, Pennsylvania]] to suppress this [[Whiskey Rebellion]]. The rebellion evaporated in late 1794 as Washington approached, personally leading the army (only two sitting Presidents have directly led American military forces, Washington during the Whiskey Rebellion and Madison in an attempt to save the White House during the [[War of 1812]]). The rebels dispersed and there was no fighting. Federalists were relieved that the new government proved capable of overcoming rebellion while Republicans, with Gallatin their new hero, argued there never was a real rebellion and the whole episode was manipulated in order to accustom Americans to a [[standing army]].\n\nAngry petitions flowed in from three dozen [[Democratic-Republican Societies]] created by Citizen Gen\u00eat. Washington attacked the societies as illegitimate and many disbanded. Federalists now ridiculed Republicans as \"democrats\" (meaning in favor of [[Ochlocracy|mob rule]]) or \"[[Jacobins]]\" (a reference to the [[Reign of Terror]] in France).\n\nWashington refused to run for a third term, establishing a two-term precedent that was to stand until 1940 and eventually to be enshrined in the Constitution as the [[Twenty-second Amendment to the United States Constitution|22nd Amendment]]. He warned in his [[Washington's Farewell Address|Farewell Address]] against involvement in European wars and lamented the rising north\u2013south sectionalism and party spirit in politics that threatened national unity: <blockquote>The party spirits serves always to distract the Public Councils, and enfeeble the Public Administration. It agitates the Community with ill-founded jealousies and false alarms; kindles the animosity of one part against another, foments occasionally riot and insurrection. It opens the door to foreign influence and corruption, which find a facilitated access to the government itself through the channels of party passions. Thus the policy and the will of one country are subjected to the policy and will of another.</blockquote>\n\nWashington never considered himself a member of any party, but broadly supported most Federalist policies.<ref>{{cite web|title=History of the Federal Judiciary|url=http://www.fjc.gov/history/home.nsf/page/tu_sedbio_fr.html}}</ref>\n\n== Newspaper editors at war ==\nThe [[spoils system]] helped finance Federalist printers until 1801 and Republican editors after that. Federalist [[United States Postmaster General|Postmasters General]], [[Timothy Pickering]] (1791\u201394) and [[Joseph Habersham]] (1795\u20131801) appointed and removed local [[postmaster]]s to maximize party funding. Numerous printers were appointed as postmasters. They did not deliver the mail, but they did collect fees from mail users and obtained free delivery of their own newspapers and business mail.<ref>Carl E.

Bache in particular targeted Washington himself as the front man for monarchy who must be exposed. To Bache, Washington was a cowardly general and a money-hungry baron who saw the Revolution as a means to advance his fortune and fame; Adams was a failed diplomat who never forgave the French their love of [[Benjamin Franklin]] and who craved a crown for himself and his descendants; and Alexander Hamilton was the most inveterate monarchist of them all.<ref>Donald H.

Hamilton subsidized the Federalist editors, wrote for their papers and in 1801 established his own paper, the ''[[New York Post|New York Evening Post]].'' Though his reputation waned considerably following his death, [[Joseph Dennie]] ran three of the most popular and influential newspapers of the period, ''The Farmer's Weekly Museum'', the ''[[Gazette of the United States]]'' and ''[[The Port Folio]]''.<ref>{{cite book |last=Lora |first=Ronald |title=The Conservative Press in Eighteenth-and Nineteenth-century America  |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fRpKaRzq6OMC&pg=PA103&lpg=PA103&dq=The+Farmer%27s+Weekly+Museum |publisher=[[Greenwood Publishing Group]] |year=1999 |pages=103\u2013111 |isbn=0-313-31043-2}}</ref>\n\n=== Ceremonies and civil religion ===\n[[File:Apotheosis of George Washington.jpg|thumb|''The Apotheosis of Washington'' as seen looking up from the Capitol rotunda in Washington, D.C.]]\nThe Federalists were conscious of the need to boost voter identification with their party.

George Washington was always their hero and after his death he became viewed as a sort of demigod looking down from heaven to bestow his blessings on the party. At first, the Federalists focused on commemorating the [[Ratification of the United States Constitution|ratification of the Constitution]] and organized parades to demonstrate widespread popular support for the new Federalist Party. The parade organizers incorporated secular versions of traditional religious themes and rituals, thereby fostering a highly visible celebration of the nation's new civil religion.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 41178897|title = The Federal Processions of 1788 and the Origins of American Civil Religion|journal = Soundings: An Interdisciplinary Journal|volume = 77|issue = 3/4|pages = 367\u2013387|last1 = Heideking|first1 = J\u00fcrgen|year = 1994}}</ref>\n\nThe [[Independence Day (United States)|Fourth of July]] became a semi-sacred day\u2014a status has maintained for much of American history.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://time.com/2951223/fourth-of-july-god-religion-america/|title=The Theology of the Fourth of July|website=Time|language=en|access-date=2020-03-16}}</ref> Its celebration in Boston emphasized national over local patriotism and included orations, dinners, militia musters, parades, marching bands, floats and fireworks.

After the collapse of the Federalists starting in 1815, the Fourth of July became a nonpartisan holiday.<ref>Len Travers, \"Hurrah for the Fourth: Patriotism, Politics, and Independence Day in Federalist Boston, 1783\u20131818.\" ''Essex Institute Historical Collections'' 125: 129\u2013161.</ref><ref>Kevin Coe, et al.

The [[1796 United States presidential election|election of 1796]] was the first partisan affair in the nation's history and one of the more scurrilous in terms of newspaper attacks. Adams swept New England and Jefferson the South, with the middle states leaning to Adams. Adams was the winner by a margin of three [[United States Electoral College|electoral votes]] and Jefferson, as the runner-up, became Vice President under the system set out in the Constitution prior to the ratification of the [[Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution|12th Amendment]].<ref>Bernard A. Weisberger, ''America afire: Jefferson, Adams, and the first contested election'' (Perennial, 2001).</ref>\n\nThe Federalists were strongest in New England, but also had strengths in the middle states. They elected Adams as President in 1796, when they controlled both houses of Congress, the presidency, eight state legislatures and ten governorships.<ref>Philip J. Lampi, \"The Federalist Party Resurgence, 1808\u20131816: Evidence from the New Nation Votes Database.\" ''Journal of the Early Republic'' 33.2 (2013): 255\u2013281.</ref>\n\nForeign affairs continued to be the central concern of American politics, for the war raging in Europe threatened to drag in the United States. The new President was a loner, who made decisions without consulting Hamilton or other \"High Federalists\". Benjamin Franklin once quipped that Adams was a man always honest, often brilliant and sometimes mad. Adams was popular among the Federalist rank and file, but had neglected to build state or local political bases of his own and neglected to take control of his own cabinet. As a result, his cabinet answered more to Hamilton than to himself. Hamilton was especially popular because he rebuilt the Army\u2014and had commissions to give out.<ref>Richard H. Kohn, ''Eagle and sword: The Federalists and the creation of the military establishment in America, 1783\u20131802'' (1975).</ref>\n\n=== Alien and Sedition Acts ===\nAfter an American delegation was insulted in Paris in the [[XYZ affair]] (1797), public opinion ran strongly against the French. An undeclared \"[[Quasi-War]]\" with France from 1798 to 1800 saw each side attacking and capturing the other's shipping. It was called \"quasi\" because there was no declaration of war, but escalation was a serious threat. At the peak of their popularity, the Federalists took advantage by preparing for an invasion by the French Army. To silence Administration critics, the Federalists passed the [[Alien and Sedition Acts]] in 1798. The Alien Act empowered the President to deport such aliens as he declared to be dangerous. The Sedition Act made it a crime to print false, scandalous and malicious criticisms of the federal government, but it conspicuously failed to criminalize criticism of Vice President Thomas Jefferson.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 1898365|title = President John Adams, Thomas Cooper, and Sedition: A Case Study in Suppression|journal = The Mississippi Valley Historical Review|volume = 42|issue = 3|pages = 438\u2013465|last1 = Smith|first1 = James Morton|year = 1955|doi = 10.2307/1898365}}</ref>\n\nSeveral Republican newspaper editors were convicted under the Act and fined or jailed and three Democratic-Republican newspapers were shut down.<ref>Marc A. Franklin, David A. Anderson, & Lyrissa Barnett Lidsky, ''Mass Media Law'' (7th ed. 2005).</ref> In response, Jefferson and Madison secretly wrote the [[Kentucky and Virginia Resolutions]] passed by the two states' legislatures that declared the Alien and Sedition Acts unconstitutional and insisted the states had the power to [[Nullification (U.S. Constitution)|nullify]] federal laws.\n\nUndaunted, the Federalists created a [[United States Navy|navy]], with new [[frigate]]s; and a large new army, with Washington in nominal command and Hamilton in actual command. To pay for it all, they raised taxes on land, houses and slaves, leading to serious unrest. In one part of Pennsylvania, the [[John Fries's Rebellion|Fries' Rebellion]] broke out, with people refusing to pay the new taxes. John Fries was sentenced to death for treason, but received a pardon from Adams. In the elections of 1798, the Federalists did very well, but this issue started hurting the Federalists in 1799. Early in 1799, Adams decided to free himself from Hamilton's overbearing influence, stunning the country and throwing his party into disarray by announcing a new peace mission to France. The mission eventually succeeded, the \"Quasi-War\" ended and the new army was largely disbanded. Hamiltonians called Adams a failure while Adams fired Hamilton's supporters still in the cabinet.\n\nHamilton and Adams intensely disliked one another and the Federalists split between supporters of Hamilton (\"High Federalists\") and supporters of Adams. Hamilton became embittered over his loss of political influence and wrote a scathing criticism of Adams' performance as President in an effort to throw Federalist support to [[Charles Cotesworth Pinckney]]. Inadvertently, this split the Federalists and helped give the victory to Jefferson.<ref name=\"Manning Dauer 1953\">Manning Dauer, ''The Adams Federalists'' (Johns Hopkins UP, 1953).</ref>\n\n== Election of 1800 ==\n{{main|United States presidential election, 1800}}\nAdams's peace moves proved popular with the Federalist rank and file and he seemed to stand a good chance of re-election in 1800. If the [[Three-Fifths Compromise]] had not been enacted, he most likely would have won reelection since many Federalist legislatures removed the right to select electors from their constituents in fear of a Democratic victory. Jefferson was again the opponent and Federalists pulled out all stops in warning that he was a dangerous revolutionary, hostile to religion, who would weaken the government, damage the economy and get into war with Britain. Many believed that if Jefferson won the election, it would be the end of the newly formed United States. The Republicans crusaded against the Alien and Sedition laws as well as the new taxes and proved highly effective in mobilizing popular discontent.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/>\n\nThe election hinged on New York as its [[United States Electoral College|electors]] were selected by the [[New York State Legislature|legislature]] and given the balance of North and South, they would decide the presidential election. [[Aaron Burr]] brilliantly organized his forces in New York City in the spring elections for the state legislature. By a few hundred votes, he carried the city\u2014and thus the state legislature\u2014and guaranteed the election of a Republican President. As a reward, he was selected by the Republican [[caucus]] in Congress as their vice presidential candidate. Alexander Hamilton, knowing the election was lost anyway, went public with a sharp attack on Adams that further divided and weakened the Federalists.<ref>Brian Phillips Murphy, \"' A Very Convenient Instrument': The Manhattan Company, Aaron Burr, and the Election of 1800.\" ''William and Mary Quarterly'' 65.2 (2008): 233\u2013266.</ref>\n\nMembers of the Republican Party planned to vote evenly for Jefferson and Burr because they did not want for it to seem as if their party was divided. The party took the meaning literally and Jefferson and Burr tied in the election with 73 electoral votes. This sent the election to the House of Representatives to break the tie. The Federalists had enough weight in the House to swing the election in either direction. Many would rather have seen Burr in the office over Jefferson, but Hamilton, who had a strong dislike of Burr, threw his political weight behind Jefferson. During the election, neither Jefferson nor Burr attempted to swing the election in the House of Representatives. Jefferson remained at Monticello to oversee the laying of bricks to a section of his home. Jefferson allowed for his political beliefs and other ideologies to filter out through letters to his contacts. Thanks to Hamilton's support, Jefferson would win the election and Burr would become his Vice President. Many Federalists held to the belief that this was the end of the United States and that the experiment they had begun had ended in failure.<ref>Miller, John C. \"The Federalist Era 1789\u20131801\" (1960)</ref> This unintended complication led directly to the proposal and ratification of the [[Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution|12th Amendment]]. \"We are all republicans\u2014we are all federalists\", proclaimed Jefferson in his [[United States presidential inauguration|inaugural address]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bartleby.com/124/pres16.html|title=Thomas Jefferson: First Inaugural Address.

Though there had been strong words and disagreements, contrary to the Federalists fears, there was no war and no ending of one-government system to let in a new one.

Those Federalists such as [[John Quincy Adams]] (John Adams' own son) and [[Rufus King]] willing to work with him were rewarded with senior diplomatic posts, but there was no punishment of the opposition.<ref>Susan Dunn, ''Jefferson's second revolution: The Election Crisis of 1800 and the Triumph of Republicanism'' (2004)</ref>\n\n== Federalists in opposition ==\n[[Fisher Ames]] (1758\u20131808) of Massachusetts ranks as one of the more influential figures of his era.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 985426|title = Fisher Ames, Spokesman for New England Federalism|journal = Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society|volume = 103|issue = 5|pages = 693\u2013715|last1 = Douglass|first1 = Elisha P.|year = 1959}}</ref> Ames led Federalist ranks in the House of Representatives. His acceptance of the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]] garnered support in Massachusetts for the new Constitution. His greatest fame came as an orator who defined the principles of the Federalist Party and the follies of the Republicans. Ames offered one of the first great speeches in American Congressional history when he spoke in favor of the [[Jay Treaty]]. Ames was part of Hamilton's faction and cautioned against the excesses of democracy unfettered by morals and reason: \"Popular reason does not always know how to act right, nor does it always act right when it knows\".<ref>Russell Kirk, ''The Conservative Mind: From Burke to Eliot'' (2001). p. 83</ref> He warned his countrymen of the dangers of flattering demagogues, who incite dis-union and lead their country into bondage: \"Our country is too big for union, too sordid for patriotism, too democratic for liberty. What is to become of it, He who made it best knows. Its vice will govern it, by practising upon its folly. This is ordained for democracies\".<ref>Fisher Ames, letter of October 26, 1803, Works, p. 483. As cited in Kirk, ''The Conservative Mind''  p. 83.</ref>\n\n=== Jefferson administration ===\n{{main|Thomas Jefferson}}\n[[File:Official Presidential portrait of Thomas Jefferson (by Rembrandt Peale, 1800).jpg|thumb|President [[Thomas Jefferson]]]]\nJefferson had a very successful first term, typified by the [[Louisiana Purchase]], which was ironically supported by Hamilton, but opposed by most Federalists at the time as unconstitutional. Some Federalist leaders ([[Essex Junto]]) began courting Jefferson's Vice President and Hamilton's nemesis Aaron Burr in an attempt to swing New York into an independent confederation with the New England states, which along with New York were supposed to secede from the United States after Burr's election to Governor. However, Hamilton's influence cost Burr the governorship of New York, a key in the Essex Junto's plan, just as Hamilton's influence had cost Burr the presidency nearly four years before. Hamilton's thwarting of Aaron Burr's ambitions for the second time was too much for Burr to bear. Hamilton had known of the Essex Junto (whom Hamilton now regarded as apostate Federalists) and Burr's plans and opposed them vehemently. This opposition by Hamilton would lead to his fatal duel with Burr in July 1804.<ref>David H. Fischer, \"The Myth of the Essex Junto.\" ''William and Mary Quarterly'' (1964): 191\u2013235.</ref>\n\nThe thoroughly disorganized Federalists hardly offered any opposition to Jefferson's reelection in 1804 and Federalists seemed doomed. Jefferson had taken away most of their patronage, including federal judgeships. The party now controlled only five state legislatures and seven governorships. After again losing the presidency in 1804, the party was now down to three legislatures and five governorships (four in New England). Their majorities in Congress were long gone, dropping in the Senate from 23 and 1796, 218 and 1800 to only six in 1804.<ref>Lampi, \"The Federalist Party Resurgence,\" p 259</ref> In New England and in some districts in the middle states, the Federalists clung to power, but the tendency from 1800 to 1812 was steady slippage almost everywhere as the Republicans perfected their organization and the Federalists tried to play catch-up. Some younger leaders tried to emulate the Democratic-Republican tactics, but their overall disdain of democracy along with the upper class bias of the party leadership eroded public support. In the South, the Federalists steadily lost ground everywhere.<ref name=\"Manning Dauer 1953\"/>\n\nThe Federalists continued for several years to be a major political party in New England and the Northeast, but never regained control of the presidency or the Congress. With the death of Washington and Hamilton and the retirement of Adams, the Federalists were left without a strong leader as [[Chief Justice of the United States|Chief Justice]] [[John Marshall]] stayed out of politics. However, a few younger leaders did appear, notably [[Daniel Webster]]. Federalist policies favored factories, banking and trade over agriculture and therefore became unpopular in the growing Western states. They were increasingly seen as aristocratic and unsympathetic to democracy. In the South, the party had lingering support in Maryland, but elsewhere was crippled by 1800 and faded away by 1808.<ref name = \"GBooks\">[https://books.google.com/books?ie=UTF-8&hl=en&vid=ISBN1570033870&id=AFS3Uu_EMQEC&dq=%22james+Monroe%22+%22republican+party%22+caucus&prev=https://books.google.com/books%3Fq%3D%2522james%2BMonroe%2522%2B%2522republican%2Bparty%2522%2Bcaucus%26lr%3D%26start%3D10&lpg=PA110&pg=PA112&sig=WOeJgA_A4A0qE0orXMCnXaX6nYQ Google Books].</ref>\n\nMassachusetts and Connecticut remained the party strongholds. Historian Richard J. Purcell explains how well organized the party was in Connecticut:\n<blockquote>It was only necessary to perfect the working methods of the organized body of office-holders who made up the nucleus of the party. There were the state officers, the assistants, and a large majority of the Assembly. In every county there was a sheriff with his deputies. All of the state, county, and town judges were potential and generally active workers. Every town had several justices of the peace, school directors and, in Federalist towns, all the town officers who were ready to carry on the party's work. Every parish had a \"standing agent,\" whose anathemas were said to convince at least ten voting deacons. Militia officers, state's attorneys, lawyers, professors and schoolteachers were in the van of this \"conscript army.\" In all, about a thousand or eleven hundred dependent officer-holders were described as the inner ring which could always be depended upon for their own and enough more votes within their control to decide an election. This was the Federalist machine.<ref>Richard J. Purcell, ''Connecticut in Transition: 1775\u20131818'' 1963. p. 190.</ref></blockquote>\n\nAfter 1800, the major Federalist role came in the judiciary. Although Jefferson managed to repeal the [[Judiciary Act of 1801]] and thus dismissed many lower level Federalist federal judges, the effort to impeach Supreme Court Justice [[Samuel Chase]] in 1804 failed. Led by the last great Federalist, [[John Marshall]] as Chief Justice from 1801 to 1835, the Supreme Court carved out a unique and powerful role as the protector of the Constitution and promoter of nationalism.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 844519|title = The Jeffersonian Assault on the Federalist Judiciary, 1802-1805; Political Forces and Press Reaction|journal = The American Journal of Legal History|volume = 14|issue = 1|pages = 55\u201375|last1 = Knudson|first1 = Jerry W.|year = 1970|doi = 10.2307/844519}}</ref>\n\n=== Anti-war party ===\nAs the wars in Europe intensified, the United States became increasingly involved. The Federalists restored some of their strength by leading the anti-war opposition to Jefferson and Madison between 1807 and 1814. President Jefferson imposed an embargo on Britain in 1807 as the [[Embargo Act of 1807]] prevented all American ships from sailing to a foreign port. The idea was that the British were so dependent on American supplies that they would come to terms. For 15 months, the Embargo wrecked American export businesses, largely based in the Boston-New York region, causing a sharp depression in the Northeast. Evasion was common and Jefferson and Treasury Secretary Gallatin responded with tightened police controls more severe than anything the Federalists had ever proposed. Public opinion was highly negative and a surge of support breathed fresh life into the Federalist Party.<ref>Lampi, \"The Federalist Party Resurgence,\"</ref>\n\nThe Republicans nominated Madison for the presidency in 1808. Meeting in the first-ever national convention, Federalists considered the option of nominating Jefferson's Vice President [[George Clinton (vice president)|George Clinton]] as their own candidate, but balked at working with him and again chose [[Charles Cotesworth Pinckney]], their 1804 candidate. Madison lost New England excluding Vermont, but swept the rest of the country and carried a Republican Congress. Madison dropped the Embargo, opened up trade again and offered a carrot and stick approach. If either France or Britain agreed to stop their violations of American neutrality, the United States would cut off trade with the other country. Tricked by Napoleon into believing France had acceded to his demands, Madison turned his wrath on Britain and the [[War of 1812]] began.<ref>James M. Banner, ''To the Hartford Convention: The Federalists and the origins of party politics in Massachusetts, 1789\u20131815'' (1970).</ref> Young Daniel Webster, running for Congress from New Hampshire in 1812, first gained overnight fame with his anti-war speeches.<ref>Kenneth E. Shewmaker, '\"This Unblessed War': Daniel Webster's Opposition to the War of 1812\" ''Historical New Hampshire'' 53#1 (1998) pp 21\u201345</ref>\n\n=== Madison administration ===\n{{main|James Madison}}\n[[File:James Madison.jpg|thumb|President [[James Madison]]]]\nThe nation was at war during the [[1812 United States presidential election|1812 presidential election]] and war was the burning issue. Opposition to the war was strong in traditional Federalist strongholds in New England and New York, where the party made a comeback in the elections of 1812 and 1814. In their second national convention in 1812, the Federalists, now the peace party, nominated [[DeWitt Clinton]], the dissident Republican [[Mayor of New York City]] and an articulate opponent of the war. Madison ran for reelection promising a relentless war against Britain and an honorable peace. Clinton, denouncing Madison's weak leadership and incompetent preparations for war, could count on New England and New York. To win, he needed the middle states and there the campaign was fought out. Those states were competitive and had the best-developed local parties and most elaborate campaign techniques, including nominating conventions and formal [[party platform]]s. The [[Tammany Hall|Tammany Society]] in New York City highly favored Madison and the Federalists finally adopted the club idea in 1808. Their [[Washington Benevolent Societies]] were semi-secret membership organizations which played a critical role in every northern state as they held meetings and rallies and mobilized Federalist votes.<ref>William Alexander Robinson, \"The Washington Benevolent Society in New England: a phase of politics during the War of 1812\", ''Proceedings of the Massachusetts Historical Society'' (1916) vol 49 pp 274ff.</ref> New Jersey went for Clinton, but Madison carried Pennsylvania and thus was reelected with 59% of the electoral votes. However, the Federalists gained 14 seats in Congress.\n\n== Opposition to the War of 1812 ==\nThe [[War of 1812]] went poorly for the Americans for two years. Even though Britain was concentrating its military efforts on its [[Napoleonic Wars|war with]] [[Napoleon I of France|Napoleon]], the United States still failed to make any headway on land and was effectively blockaded at sea by the [[Royal Navy]]. The British raided and burned [[Washington, D.C.]] in 1814 and sent a force to capture New Orleans.\n\nThe war was especially unpopular in New England. The New England economy was highly dependent on trade and the British blockade threatened to destroy it entirely. In 1814, the British Navy finally managed to enforce their blockade on the New England coast, so the Federalists of New England sent delegates to the [[Hartford Convention]] in December 1814.\n\nDuring the proceedings of the Hartford Convention, secession from the Union was discussed, though the resulting report listed a set of grievances against the Democratic-Republican federal government and proposed [[Hartford Convention#Convention report|a set of Constitutional amendments to address these grievances]]. They demanded financial assistance from Washington to compensate for lost trade and proposed constitutional amendments requiring a two-thirds vote in Congress before an embargo could be imposed, new states admitted, or war declared. It also indicated that if these proposals were ignored, then another convention should be called and given \"such powers and instructions as the exigency of a crisis may require\". The Federalist Massachusetts Governor had already secretly sent word to England to broker a separate peace accord. Three Massachusetts \"ambassadors\" were sent to Washington to negotiate on the basis of this report.\n\nBy the time the Federalist \"ambassadors\" got to Washington, the war was over and news of [[Andrew Jackson]]'s stunning victory in the [[Battle of New Orleans]] had raised American morale immensely. The \"ambassadors\" hastened back to Massachusetts, but not before they had done fatal damage to the Federalist Party. The Federalists were thereafter associated with the disloyalty and parochialism of the Hartford Convention and destroyed as a political force. Across the nation, Republicans used the great victory at New Orleans to ridicule the Federalists as cowards, defeatists and secessionists. Pamphlets, songs, newspaper editorials, speeches and entire plays on the Battle of New Orleans drove home the point.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 42628249|title = \"It Taught our Enemies a Lesson:\" the Battle of New Orleans and the Republican Destruction of the Federalist Party|journal = Tennessee Historical Quarterly|volume = 71|issue = 2|pages = 112\u2013127|last1 = Stoltz|first1 = Joseph F.|year = 2012}}</ref>\n\nThe Federalists fielded their last presidential candidate ([[Rufus King]]) in [[U.S. presidential election, 1816|1816]]. With the party's passing, partisan hatreds and newspaper feuds declined and the nation entered the \"[[Era of Good Feelings]]\". As late as 1822 the Federalists controlled the [[Massachusetts Senate]]. After the dissolution of the [[18th United States Congress|final Federalist congressional caucus]] in 1825, the last traces of Federalist activity came in Delaware and Massachusetts local politics in the late 1820s. As late as 1828, the party won control of the [[Delaware General Assembly|Delaware state legislature]]. In 1829 [[Harrison Gray Otis (politician)|Harrison Gray Otis]] was elected [[Mayor of Boston]] and became the last major Federalist office holder.\n\n== Interpretations ==\nIntellectually, Federalists were profoundly devoted to [[Republicanism in the United States|liberty]]. As [[Samuel Eliot Morison]] explained, they believed that liberty is inseparable from union, that men are essentially unequal, that ''vox populi'' (\"voice of the people\") is seldom if ever ''vox Dei'' (\"the voice of God\") and that sinister outside influences are busy undermining American integrity.<ref>Samuel Eliot Morison, ''Harrison Gray Otis, 1765\u20131848: the urbane Federalist'' (2nd ed. 1969) pages x\u2013xi</ref> Oxford-trained British historian [[Patrick Allitt]] concludes that Federalists promoted many positions that would form the baseline for later American conservatism, including the rule of law under the Constitution, republican government, peaceful change through elections, judicial supremacy, stable national finances, credible and active diplomacy and protection of wealth.<ref>Patrick Allitt, ''The Conservatives'' (2009) p 26</ref>\n\nIn terms of \"classical conservatism\", the Federalists had no [[wikt:have truck with|truck with]] European-style aristocracy, monarchy, or established religion. Historian [[John P. Diggins]] says: \"Thanks to the framers, American conservatism began on a genuinely lofty plane. James Madison, Alexander Hamilton, John Marshall, John Jay, James Wilson, and, above all, John Adams aspired to create a republic in which the values so precious to conservatives  might flourish: harmony, stability, virtue, reverence, veneration, loyalty, self-discipline, and moderation. This was classical conservatism in its most authentic expression\".<ref name=\"Diggins\"/>\n\nThe Federalists were dominated by businessmen and merchants in the major cities who supported a strong national government. The party was closely linked to the modernizing, urbanizing, financial policies of Alexander Hamilton. These policies included the funding of the national debt and also assumption of state debts incurred during the Revolutionary War, the incorporation of a national [[First Bank of the United States|Bank of the United States]], the support of manufactures and industrial development, and the use of a tariff to fund the Treasury. In foreign affairs, the Federalists opposed the French Revolution, engaged in the \"[[Quasi War]]\" (an undeclared naval war) with France in 1798\u201399, sought good relations with Britain and sought a strong army and navy. Ideologically, the controversy between Republicans and Federalists stemmed from a difference of principle and style. In terms of style, the Federalists feared mob rule, thought an educated elite should represent the general populace in national governance and favored national power over state power. Republicans distrusted Britain, bankers, merchants and did not want a powerful national government. The Federalists, notably Hamilton, were distrustful of \"the people\", the French and the Republicans.<ref>Chernow (2004)</ref> In the end, the nation synthesized the two positions, adopting representative democracy and a strong nation state. Just as importantly, American politics by the 1820s accepted the two-party system whereby rival parties stake their claims before the electorate and the winner takes control of majorities in state legislatures and the Congress and gains governorships and the presidency.\n\nAs time went on, the Federalists lost appeal with the average voter and were generally not equal to the tasks of party organization; hence they grew steadily weaker as the political triumphs of the Republican Party grew.<ref>Shaw Livermore, Jr., ''The Twilight of Federalism: The Disintegration of the Federalist Party 1815\u20131830'' (1962)</ref> For economic and philosophical reasons, the Federalists tended to be pro-British\u2014the United States engaged in more trade with [[Great Britain]] than with any other country\u2014and vociferously opposed Jefferson's Embargo Act of 1807 and the seemingly deliberate provocation of war with Britain by the Madison Administration. During \"Mr. Madison's War\", as they called it, the Federalists made a temporary comeback.<ref>{{cite book |author=Robert Vincent Remini|title=Daniel Webster: The Man and His Time|url=https://archive.org/details/danielwebsterman00remi|url-access=registration|year=1997|publisher=W.

They had some local support in New England, New York, eastern Pennsylvania, Maryland and Delaware. After the collapse of the Federalist Party in the course of the [[U.S. presidential election, 1824|1824 presidential election]], most surviving Federalists (including Daniel Webster) joined former Republicans like [[Henry Clay]] to form the [[National Republican Party (United States)|National Republican Party]], which was soon combined with other anti-Jackson groups to form the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whig Party]] in 1833. By then, nearly all remaining Federalists joined the Whigs. However, some former Federalists like [[James Buchanan]], [[Louis McLane]] and [[Roger B. Taney]] became Jacksonian Democrats.<ref>{{cite book |author=Lynn Parsons|title=The Birth of Modern Politics : Andrew Jackson, John Quincy Adams, and the Election of 1828: Andrew Jackson, John Quincy Adams, and the Election of 1828|url=https://archive.org/details/birthofmodernpol00lynn|url-access=registration|year=2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=[https://archive.org/details/birthofmodernpol00lynn/page/164 164]|isbn=9780199718504}}</ref>\n\nThe \"Old Republicans\", led by [[John Randolph of Roanoke]], refused to form a coalition with the Federalists and instead set up a separate opposition since Jefferson, Madison, Gallatin, Monroe, [[John C. Calhoun]] and Clay had in effect adopted Federalist principles of [[implied powers]] to purchase the Louisiana Territory and after the failures and lessons of the War of 1812 raised tariffs to protect factories, chartered the Second National Bank, promoted a strong army and navy and promoted [[internal improvements]]. All these measures were opposed to the [[Strict constructionism|strict construction]] of the Constitution, which was the formal basis of the Republicans, but the drift of the party to support them could not be checked. It was aided by the Supreme Court, whose influence under John Marshall as a nationalizing factor now first became apparent. The whole change reconciled the Federalists to their absorption into the Republican Party. Indeed, they claimed, with considerable show of justice, that the absorption was in the other direction: that the Republicans had recanted and that the \"Washington-Monroe policy\", as they termed it after 1820, was all that Federalists had ever desired.<ref>John Joseph Lalor. ''[[Cyclopedia of Political Science|Cyclopedia of Political Science, Political Economy, and the Political History of the United States]]'' (1881).</ref>\n\nThe name \"Federalist\" came increasingly to be used in political rhetoric as a term of abuse and was denied by the Whigs, who pointed out that their leader Henry Clay was the Republican Party leader in Congress during the 1810s.<ref>Hans Sperber and Travis Trittschuh. ''American Political Terms: An Historical Dictionary'' (1962). p. 150.</ref>\n\nThe Federalists had a weak base in the South, with their main base in the Northeast and especially New England. It was the reverse for the Republicans. As a result, anti-slavery elements were largely based in the Federalist Party. Several leading Federalists, most notably John Jay and Alexander Hamilton, were leaders of the anti-slavery movement. They led the successful battles to abolish the international slave trade in New York City and the battle to abolish slavery in the state of New York.<ref>Paul Finkelman,\"Federalist Party\" in Robert A.

In 1985, Sunstein was made a full professor of both political science and law; in 1988, he was named the [[Karl N. Llewellyn]] Professor of Jurisprudence in the Law School and Department of Political Science. The university honored him in 1993 with its \"distinguished service\" accolade, permanently changing his title to Karl N. Llewellyn Distinguished Service Professor of Jurisprudence in the Law School and Department of Political Science.\n\nSunstein was the Samuel Rubin Visiting Professor of Law at [[Columbia Law School]] in the fall of 1986 and a [[visiting professor]] at [[Harvard Law School]] in the spring 1987, winter 2005, and spring 2007 terms. He teaches courses in [[United States constitutional law|constitutional law]], [[administrative law]], and [[environmental law]], as well as the required first-year course \"Elements of the Law\", which is an introduction to legal reasoning, [[jurisprudence|legal theory]], and the interdisciplinary study of law, including [[law and economics]]. In the fall of 2008, he joined the faculty of Harvard Law School and began serving as the director of its Program on Risk Regulation:<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite web|url=http://www.law.harvard.edu/news/2008/02/19_sunstein.php |title=HLS: News: Sunstein to join Harvard Law School faculty |publisher=Law.harvard.edu |accessdate=2012-07-27}}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>The Program on Risk Regulation will focus on how law and policy deal with the central hazards of the 21st century. Anticipated areas of study include terrorism, climate change, occupational safety, infectious diseases, natural disasters, and other low-probability, high-consequence events. Sunstein plans to rely on significant student involvement in the work of this new program.<ref name=autogenerated1 /></blockquote>\n\nOn January 7, 2009, the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' reported that Sunstein would be named to head the [[Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs|White House Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs]] (OIRA).<ref>{{cite web|last=Weisman |first=Jonathan |last2=Bravin |first2=Jess |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123138051682263203 |title=Obama's Regulatory Czar Likely to Set a New Tone |work=Wall Street Journal |date=January 8, 2009 |accessdate=2012-07-27}}</ref> That news generated controversy among progressive legal scholars<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.progressivereform.org/SunsteinOIRA.cfm |title=Choices for OIRA: Reinvigorating Protection of Health, Safety, and the Environment |publisher=Center for Progressive Reform |accessdate=2012-07-27}}</ref> and environmentalists.<ref>https://thinkprogress.org/how-anti-regulation-is-obamas-new-regulatory-czar-bb113a8eaf27/</ref>Sunstein's confirmation was long blocked because of controversy over allegations about his political and academic views.

The motion passed in a 63\u201335 vote. The Senate confirmed Sunstein on September 10, 2009 in a 57\u201340 vote.\n\nIn his research on risk regulation, Sunstein is known for developing, together with [[Timur Kuran]], the concept of [[availability cascade]]s, wherein popular discussion of an idea is self-feeding and causes individuals to over weigh its importance.\n\nSunstein's books include ''After the Rights Revolution'' (1990), ''The Partial Constitution'' (1993), ''Democracy and the Problem of Free Speech'' (1993), ''Legal Reasoning and Political Conflict'' (1996), ''Free Markets and Social Justice'' (1997), ''One Case at a Time'' (1999), ''Risk and Reason'' (2002), ''Why Societies Need Dissent'' (2003), ''Laws of Fear: Beyond the Precautionary Principle'' (2005), ''Radicals in Robes: Why Extreme Right-Wing Courts Are Wrong for America'' (2005), ''Are Judges Political? An Empirical Analysis of the Federal Judiciary'' (2005), ''Infotopia: How Many Minds Produce Knowledge'' (2006), and, co-authored with [[Richard Thaler]], ''[[Nudge (book)|Nudge: Improving Decisions about Health, Wealth, and Happiness]]'' (2008).\n\nSunstein's 2006 book, ''Infotopia: How Many Minds Produce Knowledge'', explores methods for aggregating information; it contains discussions of [[prediction market]]s, [[open-source software]], and [[wiki]]s. Sunstein's 2004 book, ''The Second Bill of Rights: FDR's Unfinished Revolution and Why We Need It More than Ever'', advocates the [[Second Bill of Rights]] proposed by [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]. Among these rights are a right to an education, a right to a home, a right to health care, and a right to protection against monopolies; Sunstein argues that the Second Bill of Rights has had a large international impact and should be revived in the United States. His 2001 book, ''Republic.com'', argued that the [[Internet]] may weaken [[democracy]] because it allows citizens to isolate themselves within groups that share their own views and experiences, and thus cut themselves off from any information that might challenge their beliefs, a phenomenon known as [[cyberbalkanization]]. He recanted many of the views expressed in the book before his confirmation as administrator of the [[Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs]] in order to receive Senate confirmation.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} Asked by [[Rudy Takala]] if Sunstein's views nonetheless persisted in the Obama administration, [[U.S. Federal Communications Commission]] Commissioner [[Michael O'Rielly]] eluded the question, answering, \"Everybody needs a nudge, right?\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/rudy-takala/fcc-commissioner-speaks-out-against-federal-regulation-internet |title=FCC Commissioner Speaks Out Against Federal Regulation of Internet |work=CNSNews.com |date=January 21, 2015 |accessdate=2015-02-17}}</ref>\n\nSunstein co-authored ''[[Nudge (book)|Nudge]]: Improving Decisions about Health, Wealth, and Happiness'' (Yale University Press, 2008) with economist [[Richard Thaler]] of the University of Chicago. ''Nudge'' discusses how public and private organizations can help people make better choices in their daily lives. Thaler and Sunstein argue that\n\n<blockquote>People often make poor choices \u2013 and look back at them with bafflement! We do this because as human beings, we all are susceptible to a wide array of routine biases that can lead to an equally wide array of embarrassing blunders in education, personal finance, health care, mortgages and credit cards, happiness, and even the planet itself.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}</blockquote>\n\nThe ideas in the book proved popular with politicians such as U.S. President [[Barack Obama]], British Prime Minister [[David Cameron]], and the [[Conservative Party (UK)|British Conservative Party]] in general.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2008/aug/22/davidcameron.conservatives|title=Speak 'Nudge': The 10 key phrases from David Cameron's favourite book|author=Andrew Sparrow|work=[[The Guardian]] |date=2008-08-22|accessdate=2009-09-09 | location=London}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/career_and_jobs/article4330267.ece|title=Why Barack Obama and David Cameron are keen to 'nudge' you|work=[[The Times]] |author=Carol Lewis |date=2009-07-22|accessdate=2009-09-09 | location=London}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spectator.co.uk/the-magazine/features/839676/nudge-nudge-meet-the-cameroons-new-guru.thtml|title=Nudge, nudge: meet the Cameroons' new guru|work=[[The Spectator]]|author=James Forsyth|date=2009-07-16|accessdate=2009-09-09|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090124222449/http://www.spectator.co.uk/the-magazine/features/839676/nudge-nudge-meet-the-cameroons-new-guru.thtml|archivedate=2009-01-24|df=}}</ref> The \"Nudge\" idea has also been criticised. Dr Tammy Boyce, from public health foundation [[The King's Fund]], has said:\n<blockquote>We need to move away from short-term, politically motivated initiatives such as the 'nudging people' idea, which are not based on any good evidence and don't help people make long-term behavior changes.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/health-and-wellbeing/health-news/unhealthy-lifestyles-here-to-stay-in-spite-of-costly-campaigns-1055693.html | work=The Independent | location=London | title=Unhealthy lifestyles here to stay, in spite of costly campaigns | first=Nina | last=Lakhani | date=December 7, 2008 | accessdate=April 28, 2010}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nContributing to the anthology ''Our American Story'' (2019), Sunstein addressed the possibility of a shared American narrative.

He is considered so prolific a writer that in 2007, an article in the legal publication ''[[The Green Bag (1997)|The Green Bag]]'' coined the concept of a \"Sunstein number\" reflecting [[degrees of separation]] between various legal authors and Sunstein, paralleling the [[Erd\u0151s number]]s sometimes assigned to [[mathematician]] authors.<ref>{{cite journal| last1 = Edelman | first1 = Paul H. | last2 = George | first2 = Tracey E. | title = Six Degrees of Cass Sunstein | journal = The Green Bag | volume = 11 | issue = 1 | pages = 19\u201336 | url = http://www.greenbag.org/v11n1/v11n1_edelman_and_george.pdf | year = 2007}}</ref>\n\nHe is a member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] (elected 1992) and the [[American Law Institute]] (since 1990).

Jolls]], to show how the theoretical assumptions of [[law and economics]] should be modified by new empirical findings about how people actually behave. {{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}\n\nAccording to Sunstein, the interpretation of federal law should be made not by judges but by the beliefs and commitments of the U.S. president and those around him.\n\"There is no reason to believe that in the face of statutory ambiguity, the meaning of federal law should be settled by the inclinations and predispositions of federal judges. The outcome should instead depend on the commitments and beliefs of the President and those who operate under him,\" argued Sunstein.<ref>{{cite web|last=Sunstein |first=Cass |url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Beyond+Marbury%3a+the+executive%27s+power+to+say+what+the+law+is.-a0154908627 |title=Beyond Marbury: The Executive's Power To Say What the Law Is |publisher=The Yale Law Journal www.yalelawjournal.org/ |date=September 25, 2006 |accessdate=2013-08-07}}</ref>\n\nSunstein (along with his coauthor [[Richard Thaler]]) has elaborated the theory of [[libertarian paternalism]].

With Thaler, he coined the term \"[[choice architecture|choice architect]].\"<ref name=Nudge />\n\n===Military commissions===\nIn 2002, at the height of controversy over Bush's creation of military commissions without Congressional approval, Sunstein stepped forward to insist, \"Under existing law, President George W. Bush has the legal authority to use military commissions\" and that \"President Bush's choice stands on firm legal ground.\" Sunstein scorned as \"ludicrous\" an argument from law professor [[George P. Fletcher]], who believed that the Supreme Court would find Bush's military commissions without any legal basis.<ref name=milcom>{{cite web|url=http://prospect.org/article/military-tribunal-debate|title=The Military Tribunal Debate|work=The American Prospect}}</ref> In 2006, the Supreme Court found the tribunals illegal in ''[[Hamdan v. Rumsfeld]]'' in a 5\u20133 vote.\n\n===First Amendment===\nIn his book ''Democracy and the Problem of Free Speech'' Sunstein says there is a need to reformulate [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment law]]. He thinks that the current formulation, based on [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.|Justice Holmes']] conception of free speech as a marketplace \"disserves the aspirations of those who wrote America's founding document.\"<ref>Cass R. Sunstein, ''Democracy and the Problem of Free Speech'', The Free Press, 1995, p. 119e</ref> The purpose of this reformulation would be to \"reinvigorate processes of democratic deliberation, by ensuring greater attention to public issues and greater diversity of views.\"<ref name=\"Cass R.

[[Saxby Chambliss]] (R-Ga.) blocked his appointment to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs by Obama. Chambliss objected to the introduction of ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=e7FME0btkH0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Animal+Rights:+Current+Debates+and+New+Directions&ei=RSCpSsOWJoO0zATBwfybCg#v=onepage&q=&f=false Animal Rights: Current Debates and New Directions]'', a volume edited by Sunstein and his then-companion Martha Nussbaum. On [https://books.google.com/books?id=e7FME0btkH0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Animal+Rights:+Current+Debates+and+New+Directions&ei=RSCpSsOWJoO0zATBwfybCg#v=snippet&q=bring%20suit&f=false page 11] of the introduction, during a philosophical discussion about whether animals should be thought of as owned by humans, Sunstein notes that personhood need not be conferred upon an animal in order to grant it various legal protections against abuse or cruelty, even including [[Standing (law)|legal standing]] for suit. For example, under current law, if someone saw their neighbor beating a dog, they cannot sue for animal cruelty because they do not have legal standing to do so. Sunstein suggests that granting standing to animals, actionable by other parties, could decrease animal cruelty by increasing the likelihood that animal abuse will be punished.\n\n=== Taxation ===\nSunstein has argued, \"We should celebrate tax day.\"<ref name=\"home.uchicago.edu\">http://home.uchicago.edu/~csunstei/celebrate.html, Accessed July 23, 2009</ref> Sunstein argues that since government (in the form of police, fire departments, insured banks, and courts) protects and preserves property and liberty, individuals should happily finance it with their tax dollars:\n\n<blockquote>\nIn what sense is the money in our pockets and bank accounts fully 'ours'? Did we earn it by our own autonomous efforts? Could we have inherited it without the assistance of probate courts? Do we save it without the support of bank regulators? Could we spend it if there were no public officials to coordinate the efforts and pool the resources of the community in which we live? Without taxes, there would be no liberty. Without taxes there would be no property. Without taxes, few of us would have any assets worth defending. [It is] a dim fiction that some people enjoy and exercise their rights without placing any burden whatsoever on the public\u2026 There is no liberty without dependency.<ref name=\"home.uchicago.edu\"/>\n</blockquote>\n\nSunstein goes on to say:\n<blockquote>If government could not intervene effectively, none of the individual rights to which Americans have become accustomed could be reliably protected. [...] This is why the overused distinction between \"negative\" and \"positive\" rights makes little sense. Rights to private property, freedom of speech, immunity from police abuse, contractual liberty and free exercise of religion \u2013 just as much as rights to Social Security, Medicare and food stamps \u2013 are taxpayer-funded and government-managed social services designed to improve collective and individual well-being.<ref name=\"home.uchicago.edu\"/></blockquote>\n\n=== Marriage ===\nIn ''Nudge: Improving Decisions About Health, Wealth, and Happiness'', Sunstein proposes that government recognition of marriage be discontinued. \"Under our proposal, the word marriage would no longer appear in any laws, and marriage licenses would no longer be offered or recognized by any level of government,\" argues Sunstein. He continues, \"the only legal status states would confer on couples would be a civil union, which would be a domestic partnership agreement between any two people.\" He goes on further, \"Governments would not be asked to endorse any particular relationships by conferring on them the term marriage,\" and refers to state-recognized marriage as an \"official license scheme.\"<ref name=Nudge>{{cite book |title=Nudge: Improving Decisions About Health, Wealth, and Happiness |last=Thaler |first=Richard H. |authorlink= |author2=Sunstein, Cass R. |year=2008 |publisher=Caravan Books |isbn=978-0-300-12223-7 }}</ref>\nSunstein addressed the [[Senate of the United States|Senate]] on 11 July 1996 advising against the [[Defense of Marriage Act]].<ref name=Senate>{{cite web |title=The Defense of Marriage Act: hearing before the United States Senate Judiciary Committee |url=https://archive.org/stream/defenseofmarriag00unit#page/42/mode/2up}}</ref>\n\n=== \"Conspiracy Theories\" and government infiltration ===\nSunstein co-authored a 2008 paper with [[Adrian Vermeule]], titled \"Conspiracy Theories,\" dealing with the risks and possible government responses to conspiracy theories resulting from \"cascades\" of faulty information within groups that may ultimately lead to violence. In this article they wrote, \"The existence of both domestic and foreign conspiracy theories, we suggest, is no trivial matter, posing real risks to the government's antiterrorism policies, whatever the latter may be.\"  They go on to propose that, \"the best response consists in cognitive infiltration of extremist groups\",<ref name=conspiracy>{{cite journal|ssrn=1084585 |title=Conspiracy Theories by Cass Sunstein, Adrian Vermeule  |doi=10.2139/ssrn.1084585 |publisher=Papers.ssrn.com |year=2008  |last1=Sunstein  |first1=Cass R.  |last2=Vermeule  |first2=Adrian  }}</ref> where they suggest, among other tactics, \"Government agents (and their allies) might enter chat rooms, online social networks, or even real-space groups and attempt to undermine percolating conspiracy theories by raising doubts about their factual premises, causal logic or implications for political action.\"<ref name=conspiracy /> They refer, several times, to groups that promote the view that the US Government was responsible or complicit in the [[September 11 attacks]] as \"extremist groups.\"\n\nThe authors declare that there are five hypothetical responses a government can take toward conspiracy theories: \"We can readily imagine a series of possible responses. (1) Government might ban conspiracy theorizing. (2) Government might impose some kind of tax, financial or otherwise, on those who disseminate such theories. (3) Government might itself engage in counterspeech, marshaling arguments to discredit conspiracy theories. (4) Government might formally hire credible private parties to engage in counterspeech. (5) Government might engage in informal communication with such parties, encouraging them to help.\" However, the authors advocate that each \"instrument has a distinctive set of potential effects, or costs and benefits, and each will have a place under imaginable conditions. However, our main policy idea is that government should engage in cognitive infiltration of the groups that produce conspiracy theories, which involves a mix of (3), (4) and (5).\"\n\nSunstein and Vermeule also analyze the practice of recruiting \"nongovernmental officials\"; they suggest that \"government can supply these independent experts with information and perhaps prod them into action from behind the scenes,\" further warning that \"too close a connection will be self-defeating if it is exposed.\"<ref name=conspiracy /> Sunstein and Vermeule argue that the practice of enlisting non-government officials, \"might ensure that credible independent experts offer the rebuttal, rather than government officials themselves. There is a tradeoff between credibility and control, however. The price of credibility is that government cannot be seen to control the independent experts.\" This position has been criticized by some commentators<ref>[http://rawstory.com/2010/01/obama-staffer-infiltration-911-groups/ ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160129231203/http://rawstory.com/2010/01/obama-staffer-infiltration-911-groups/ |date=January 29, 2016 }}</ref><ref>[http://stossel.blogs.foxbusiness.com/2010/01/18/stealth-propaganda/?test=latestnews] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100121133714/http://stossel.blogs.foxbusiness.com/2010/01/18/stealth-propaganda/?test=latestnews |date=January 21, 2010 }}</ref> who argue that it would violate prohibitions on government propaganda aimed at domestic citizens.<ref>{{cite news|last=Greenwald |first=Glenn |url=http://www.salon.com/news/opinion/glenn_greenwald/2010/01/15/sunstein/index.html |title=Obama confidant's spine-chilling proposal |work=Salon.com |date=January 15, 2010 |accessdate=2012-07-27}}</ref> Sunstein and Vermeule's proposed infiltrations have also been met by sharply critical scholarly critiques.<ref>David Ray Griffin, ''Cognitive Infiltration, An Obama Appointee's Plan To Undermine The 9/11 Conspiracy Theory''.

On February 28, 2020, nearly a month after the [[World Health Organization]] declared a global health emergency due to the [[Coronavirus pandemic]], Sunstein wrote for [[Bloomberg Opinion]] that \u201c[a] lot of people are more scared than they have any reason to be\u201d and that they have \u201can exaggerated sense of their own personal risk.\u201d He argued that \u201cmost people in North America and Europe do not need to worry much about the risk of contracting the disease.\u201d In his view, there was \u201cno adequate reason\u201d to change travel plans or other socioeconomic behaviors, since they risk \u201cplummeting stock prices.\u201d In the face of this, Sunstein urged calm and cautioned leaders to weigh the costs of merely potentially saving lives against the actual costs of falling prices in corporate equities. He blamed this tendency to view possibly saving lives as better than actually saving money on \"probability neglect,\" a term that he invented.\n\nA few weeks later Sunstein wrote in Bloomberg Opinion that \u201con the basis of current knowledge, extensive precautions, not ending soon, are amply justified by the most hard-headed forms of analysis that we have.\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-02-28/coronavirus-panic-caused-by-probability-neglect|title=The Cognitive Bias That Makes Us Panic About Coronavirus|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-02-28/coronavirus-panic-caused-by-probability-neglect|title=This Time the Numbers Show We Can\u2019t Be Too Careful|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n=== Star Wars ===\n\nIn 2016, Sunstein wrote of the [[Disney]] film franchise [[Star Wars]] that \"Star Wars is about freedom of choice and our never-ending ability to make the right decision when the chips are down,\" comparing the importance of the films to the [[Bible]], [[Santa Claus]], and [[Mickey Mouse]]. <ref>{{Cite book|last=Sunstein|first=Cass|title=The World According to Star Wars|publisher=Dey Street Books|year=2016|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> The publication was reviewed in ''Time'' magazine, where it was described as \"the ultimate primer for guiding a Star Wars padawan to the level of Jedi Knight.\"<ref>{{Cite news|last=Fitzpatrick|first=Alex|url=https://time.com/4352086/cass-r-sunstein-the-world-according-to-star-wars/|title=This Book Will Help You Become the Ultimate Star Wars Fan|date=|work=|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n\"Star Wars,\" he writes, \"is a grain of sand; it contains a whole world.\" This, he argues, is evident even if one \"can't tell an Ackbar from [...] a Snoke.\" As he develops his thesis, he takes this argument further, arguing that the \"hidden message and the real magic of Star Wars\" is \"its rousing tribute to human freedom.\"<ref>{{cite book |last1=Sunstain |first1=Cass |title=The World According to Star Wars |date=2016 |publisher=Del Rey Books |page=Preface}}</ref> In an interview with the [[AV Club]], Sunstein stated that he felt \"over the moon about ''Star Wars''.\" The film franchise, in his view, \"casts light not just on the saga of our time, but also on everything about our culture,\" and includes many \"puzzles\" for the curious. Despite his overall positive view of Lucas' oeuvre and the impact of the franchise on society, Sunstein had some criticism for the prequel films, and likened that to society at large:\n\n:The sky is always falling or the sky is always bright. In some ways, this is really morning in America and we don\u2019t see it. People are living longer, the economy is doing pretty well. On the other hand, there are some ways of thinking in the current situation that make it look not so good, including our Star Wars prequels\n\nSunstein compared ''Star Wars'' to his work for the Obama administration, saying that his approach to regulatory reform was very similar to Lucas' constrained approach to the movies as \"episodes.\"<ref>{{cite web |last1=McLevy |first1=Alex |title=Cass Sunstein explains why Star Wars is like America |url=https://film.avclub.com/cass-sunstein-explains-why-star-wars-is-like-america-1798248001 |publisher=AV Club |accessdate=30 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nIn the 1980s and early 1990s, Sunstein was married to Lisa Ruddick, whom he met when both were undergraduates at Harvard.<ref>.https://books.google.com/books?id=m_mVWRPShyYC&pg=PR15&dq=cass+%22lisa+ruddick%22&hl=lt&sig=3rj5-V8-vIkWzjHp0FBqDgRchmY#PPR15,M1</ref> She is Associate Professor of English at the [[University of Chicago]], specializing in British modernism.<ref>.http://english.uchicago.edu/faculty/lisa-ruddick</ref> Their marriage ended in divorce.

In 1985, Sunstein was made a full professor of both political science and law; in 1988, he was named the [[Karl N. Llewellyn]] Professor of Jurisprudence in the Law School and Department of Political Science. The university honored him in 1993 with its \"distinguished service\" accolade, permanently changing his title to Karl N. Llewellyn Distinguished Service Professor of Jurisprudence in the Law School and Department of Political Science.\n\nSunstein was the Samuel Rubin Visiting Professor of Law at [[Columbia Law School]] in the fall of 1986 and a [[visiting professor]] at [[Harvard Law School]] in the spring 1987, winter 2005, and spring 2007 terms. He teaches courses in [[United States constitutional law|constitutional law]], [[administrative law]], and [[environmental law]], as well as the required first-year course \"Elements of the Law\", which is an introduction to legal reasoning, [[jurisprudence|legal theory]], and the interdisciplinary study of law, including [[law and economics]].

The motion passed in a 63\u201335 vote. The Senate confirmed Sunstein on September 10, 2009 in a 57\u201340 vote.\n\nIn his research on risk regulation, Sunstein is known for developing, together with [[Timur Kuran]], the concept of [[availability cascade]]s, wherein popular discussion of an idea is self-feeding and causes individuals to over weigh its importance.\n\nSunstein's books include ''After the Rights Revolution'' (1990), ''The Partial Constitution'' (1993), ''Democracy and the Problem of Free Speech'' (1993), ''Legal Reasoning and Political Conflict'' (1996), ''Free Markets and Social Justice'' (1997), ''One Case at a Time'' (1999), ''Risk and Reason'' (2002), ''Why Societies Need Dissent'' (2003), ''Laws of Fear: Beyond the Precautionary Principle'' (2005), ''Radicals in Robes: Why Extreme Right-Wing Courts Are Wrong for America'' (2005), ''Are Judges Political?

Sunstein's 2004 book, ''The Second Bill of Rights: FDR's Unfinished Revolution and Why We Need It More than Ever'', advocates the [[Second Bill of Rights]] proposed by [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]. Among these rights are a right to an education, a right to a home, a right to health care, and a right to protection against monopolies; Sunstein argues that the Second Bill of Rights has had a large international impact and should be revived in the United States. His 2001 book, ''Republic.com'', argued that the [[Internet]] may weaken [[democracy]] because it allows citizens to isolate themselves within groups that share their own views and experiences, and thus cut themselves off from any information that might challenge their beliefs, a phenomenon known as [[cyberbalkanization]]. He recanted many of the views expressed in the book before his confirmation as administrator of the [[Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs]] in order to receive Senate confirmation.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} Asked by [[Rudy Takala]] if Sunstein's views nonetheless persisted in the Obama administration, [[U.S. Federal Communications Commission]] Commissioner [[Michael O'Rielly]] eluded the question, answering, \"Everybody needs a nudge, right?\"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/rudy-takala/fcc-commissioner-speaks-out-against-federal-regulation-internet |title=FCC Commissioner Speaks Out Against Federal Regulation of Internet |work=CNSNews.com |date=January 21, 2015 |accessdate=2015-02-17}}</ref>\n\nSunstein co-authored ''[[Nudge (book)|Nudge]]: Improving Decisions about Health, Wealth, and Happiness'' (Yale University Press, 2008) with economist [[Richard Thaler]] of the University of Chicago. ''Nudge'' discusses how public and private organizations can help people make better choices in their daily lives. Thaler and Sunstein argue that\n\n<blockquote>People often make poor choices \u2013 and look back at them with bafflement! We do this because as human beings, we all are susceptible to a wide array of routine biases that can lead to an equally wide array of embarrassing blunders in education, personal finance, health care, mortgages and credit cards, happiness, and even the planet itself.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}</blockquote>\n\nThe ideas in the book proved popular with politicians such as U.S. President [[Barack Obama]], British Prime Minister [[David Cameron]], and the [[Conservative Party (UK)|British Conservative Party]] in general.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/blog/2008/aug/22/davidcameron.conservatives|title=Speak 'Nudge': The 10 key phrases from David Cameron's favourite book|author=Andrew Sparrow|work=[[The Guardian]] |date=2008-08-22|accessdate=2009-09-09 | location=London}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/career_and_jobs/article4330267.ece|title=Why Barack Obama and David Cameron are keen to 'nudge' you|work=[[The Times]] |author=Carol Lewis |date=2009-07-22|accessdate=2009-09-09 | location=London}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spectator.co.uk/the-magazine/features/839676/nudge-nudge-meet-the-cameroons-new-guru.thtml|title=Nudge, nudge: meet the Cameroons' new guru|work=[[The Spectator]]|author=James Forsyth|date=2009-07-16|accessdate=2009-09-09|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090124222449/http://www.spectator.co.uk/the-magazine/features/839676/nudge-nudge-meet-the-cameroons-new-guru.thtml|archivedate=2009-01-24|df=}}</ref> The \"Nudge\" idea has also been criticised.

He is considered so prolific a writer that in 2007, an article in the legal publication ''[[The Green Bag (1997)|The Green Bag]]'' coined the concept of a \"Sunstein number\" reflecting [[degrees of separation]] between various legal authors and Sunstein, paralleling the [[Erd\u0151s number]]s sometimes assigned to [[mathematician]] authors.<ref>{{cite journal| last1 = Edelman | first1 = Paul H. | last2 = George | first2 = Tracey E. | title = Six Degrees of Cass Sunstein | journal = The Green Bag | volume = 11 | issue = 1 | pages = 19\u201336 | url = http://www.greenbag.org/v11n1/v11n1_edelman_and_george.pdf | year = 2007}}</ref>\n\nHe is a member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] (elected 1992) and the [[American Law Institute]] (since 1990).

Jolls]], to show how the theoretical assumptions of [[law and economics]] should be modified by new empirical findings about how people actually behave. {{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}\n\nAccording to Sunstein, the interpretation of federal law should be made not by judges but by the beliefs and commitments of the U.S. president and those around him.\n\"There is no reason to believe that in the face of statutory ambiguity, the meaning of federal law should be settled by the inclinations and predispositions of federal judges. The outcome should instead depend on the commitments and beliefs of the President and those who operate under him,\" argued Sunstein.<ref>{{cite web|last=Sunstein |first=Cass |url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Beyond+Marbury%3a+the+executive%27s+power+to+say+what+the+law+is.-a0154908627 |title=Beyond Marbury: The Executive's Power To Say What the Law Is |publisher=The Yale Law Journal www.yalelawjournal.org/ |date=September 25, 2006 |accessdate=2013-08-07}}</ref>\n\nSunstein (along with his coauthor [[Richard Thaler]]) has elaborated the theory of [[libertarian paternalism]].  In arguing for this theory, he counsels thinkers/academics/politicians to embrace the findings of behavioral economics as applied to law, maintaining freedom of choice while also steering peoples' decisions in directions that will make their lives go better. With Thaler, he coined the term \"[[choice architecture|choice architect]].\"<ref name=Nudge />\n\n===Military commissions===\nIn 2002, at the height of controversy over Bush's creation of military commissions without Congressional approval, Sunstein stepped forward to insist, \"Under existing law, President George W. Bush has the legal authority to use military commissions\" and that \"President Bush's choice stands on firm legal ground.\" Sunstein scorned as \"ludicrous\" an argument from law professor [[George P.

Rumsfeld]]'' in a 5\u20133 vote.\n\n===First Amendment===\nIn his book ''Democracy and the Problem of Free Speech'' Sunstein says there is a need to reformulate [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment law]]. He thinks that the current formulation, based on [[Oliver Wendell Holmes, Jr.|Justice Holmes']] conception of free speech as a marketplace \"disserves the aspirations of those who wrote America's founding document.\"<ref>Cass R. Sunstein, ''Democracy and the Problem of Free Speech'', The Free Press, 1995, p. 119e</ref> The purpose of this reformulation would be to \"reinvigorate processes of democratic deliberation, by ensuring greater attention to public issues and greater diversity of views.\"<ref name=\"Cass R.

[[Saxby Chambliss]] (R-Ga.) blocked his appointment to the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs by Obama. Chambliss objected to the introduction of ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=e7FME0btkH0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Animal+Rights:+Current+Debates+and+New+Directions&ei=RSCpSsOWJoO0zATBwfybCg#v=onepage&q=&f=false Animal Rights: Current Debates and New Directions]'', a volume edited by Sunstein and his then-companion Martha Nussbaum. On [https://books.google.com/books?id=e7FME0btkH0C&printsec=frontcover&dq=Animal+Rights:+Current+Debates+and+New+Directions&ei=RSCpSsOWJoO0zATBwfybCg#v=snippet&q=bring%20suit&f=false page 11] of the introduction, during a philosophical discussion about whether animals should be thought of as owned by humans, Sunstein notes that personhood need not be conferred upon an animal in order to grant it various legal protections against abuse or cruelty, even including [[Standing (law)|legal standing]] for suit. For example, under current law, if someone saw their neighbor beating a dog, they cannot sue for animal cruelty because they do not have legal standing to do so. Sunstein suggests that granting standing to animals, actionable by other parties, could decrease animal cruelty by increasing the likelihood that animal abuse will be punished.\n\n=== Taxation ===\nSunstein has argued, \"We should celebrate tax day.\"<ref name=\"home.uchicago.edu\">http://home.uchicago.edu/~csunstei/celebrate.html, Accessed July 23, 2009</ref> Sunstein argues that since government (in the form of police, fire departments, insured banks, and courts) protects and preserves property and liberty, individuals should happily finance it with their tax dollars:\n\n<blockquote>\nIn what sense is the money in our pockets and bank accounts fully 'ours'? Did we earn it by our own autonomous efforts? Could we have inherited it without the assistance of probate courts? Do we save it without the support of bank regulators? Could we spend it if there were no public officials to coordinate the efforts and pool the resources of the community in which we live? Without taxes, there would be no liberty. Without taxes there would be no property. Without taxes, few of us would have any assets worth defending. [It is] a dim fiction that some people enjoy and exercise their rights without placing any burden whatsoever on the public\u2026 There is no liberty without dependency.<ref name=\"home.uchicago.edu\"/>\n</blockquote>\n\nSunstein goes on to say:\n<blockquote>If government could not intervene effectively, none of the individual rights to which Americans have become accustomed could be reliably protected. [...] This is why the overused distinction between \"negative\" and \"positive\" rights makes little sense. Rights to private property, freedom of speech, immunity from police abuse, contractual liberty and free exercise of religion \u2013 just as much as rights to Social Security, Medicare and food stamps \u2013 are taxpayer-funded and government-managed social services designed to improve collective and individual well-being.<ref name=\"home.uchicago.edu\"/></blockquote>\n\n=== Marriage ===\nIn ''Nudge: Improving Decisions About Health, Wealth, and Happiness'', Sunstein proposes that government recognition of marriage be discontinued. \"Under our proposal, the word marriage would no longer appear in any laws, and marriage licenses would no longer be offered or recognized by any level of government,\" argues Sunstein. He continues, \"the only legal status states would confer on couples would be a civil union, which would be a domestic partnership agreement between any two people.\" He goes on further, \"Governments would not be asked to endorse any particular relationships by conferring on them the term marriage,\" and refers to state-recognized marriage as an \"official license scheme.\"<ref name=Nudge>{{cite book |title=Nudge: Improving Decisions About Health, Wealth, and Happiness |last=Thaler |first=Richard H. |authorlink= |author2=Sunstein, Cass R. |year=2008 |publisher=Caravan Books |isbn=978-0-300-12223-7 }}</ref>\nSunstein addressed the [[Senate of the United States|Senate]] on 11 July 1996 advising against the [[Defense of Marriage Act]].<ref name=Senate>{{cite web |title=The Defense of Marriage Act: hearing before the United States Senate Judiciary Committee |url=https://archive.org/stream/defenseofmarriag00unit#page/42/mode/2up}}</ref>\n\n=== \"Conspiracy Theories\" and government infiltration ===\nSunstein co-authored a 2008 paper with [[Adrian Vermeule]], titled \"Conspiracy Theories,\" dealing with the risks and possible government responses to conspiracy theories resulting from \"cascades\" of faulty information within groups that may ultimately lead to violence. In this article they wrote, \"The existence of both domestic and foreign conspiracy theories, we suggest, is no trivial matter, posing real risks to the government's antiterrorism policies, whatever the latter may be.\"  They go on to propose that, \"the best response consists in cognitive infiltration of extremist groups\",<ref name=conspiracy>{{cite journal|ssrn=1084585 |title=Conspiracy Theories by Cass Sunstein, Adrian Vermeule  |doi=10.2139/ssrn.1084585 |publisher=Papers.ssrn.com |year=2008  |last1=Sunstein  |first1=Cass R.  |last2=Vermeule  |first2=Adrian  }}</ref> where they suggest, among other tactics, \"Government agents (and their allies) might enter chat rooms, online social networks, or even real-space groups and attempt to undermine percolating conspiracy theories by raising doubts about their factual premises, causal logic or implications for political action.\"<ref name=conspiracy /> They refer, several times, to groups that promote the view that the US Government was responsible or complicit in the [[September 11 attacks]] as \"extremist groups.\"\n\nThe authors declare that there are five hypothetical responses a government can take toward conspiracy theories: \"We can readily imagine a series of possible responses. (1) Government might ban conspiracy theorizing. (2) Government might impose some kind of tax, financial or otherwise, on those who disseminate such theories. (3) Government might itself engage in counterspeech, marshaling arguments to discredit conspiracy theories. (4) Government might formally hire credible private parties to engage in counterspeech. (5) Government might engage in informal communication with such parties, encouraging them to help.\" However, the authors advocate that each \"instrument has a distinctive set of potential effects, or costs and benefits, and each will have a place under imaginable conditions. However, our main policy idea is that government should engage in cognitive infiltration of the groups that produce conspiracy theories, which involves a mix of (3), (4) and (5).\"\n\nSunstein and Vermeule also analyze the practice of recruiting \"nongovernmental officials\"; they suggest that \"government can supply these independent experts with information and perhaps prod them into action from behind the scenes,\" further warning that \"too close a connection will be self-defeating if it is exposed.\"<ref name=conspiracy /> Sunstein and Vermeule argue that the practice of enlisting non-government officials, \"might ensure that credible independent experts offer the rebuttal, rather than government officials themselves.

On February 28, 2020, nearly a month after the [[World Health Organization]] declared a global health emergency due to the [[Coronavirus pandemic]], Sunstein wrote for [[Bloomberg Opinion]] that \u201c[a] lot of people are more scared than they have any reason to be\u201d and that they have \u201can exaggerated sense of their own personal risk.\u201d He argued that \u201cmost people in North America and Europe do not need to worry much about the risk of contracting the disease.\u201d In his view, there was \u201cno adequate reason\u201d to change travel plans or other socioeconomic behaviors, since they risk \u201cplummeting stock prices.\u201d In the face of this, Sunstein urged calm and cautioned leaders to weigh the costs of merely potentially saving lives against the actual costs of falling prices in corporate equities. He blamed this tendency to view possibly saving lives as better than actually saving money on \"probability neglect,\" a term that he invented.\n\nA few weeks later Sunstein wrote in Bloomberg Opinion that \u201con the basis of current knowledge, extensive precautions, not ending soon, are amply justified by the most hard-headed forms of analysis that we have.\u201d<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-02-28/coronavirus-panic-caused-by-probability-neglect|title=The Cognitive Bias That Makes Us Panic About Coronavirus|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/opinion/articles/2020-02-28/coronavirus-panic-caused-by-probability-neglect|title=This Time the Numbers Show We Can\u2019t Be Too Careful|last=|first=|date=|website=|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n=== Star Wars ===\n\nIn 2016, Sunstein wrote of the [[Disney]] film franchise [[Star Wars]] that \"Star Wars is about freedom of choice and our never-ending ability to make the right decision when the chips are down,\" comparing the importance of the films to the [[Bible]], [[Santa Claus]], and [[Mickey Mouse]]. <ref>{{Cite book|last=Sunstein|first=Cass|title=The World According to Star Wars|publisher=Dey Street Books|year=2016|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref> The publication was reviewed in ''Time'' magazine, where it was described as \"the ultimate primer for guiding a Star Wars padawan to the level of Jedi Knight.\"<ref>{{Cite news|last=Fitzpatrick|first=Alex|url=https://time.com/4352086/cass-r-sunstein-the-world-according-to-star-wars/|title=This Book Will Help You Become the Ultimate Star Wars Fan|date=|work=|access-date=|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n\"Star Wars,\" he writes, \"is a grain of sand; it contains a whole world.\" This, he argues, is evident even if one \"can't tell an Ackbar from [...] a Snoke.\" As he develops his thesis, he takes this argument further, arguing that the \"hidden message and the real magic of Star Wars\" is \"its rousing tribute to human freedom.\"<ref>{{cite book |last1=Sunstain |first1=Cass |title=The World According to Star Wars |date=2016 |publisher=Del Rey Books |page=Preface}}</ref> In an interview with the [[AV Club]], Sunstein stated that he felt \"over the moon about ''Star Wars''.\" The film franchise, in his view, \"casts light not just on the saga of our time, but also on everything about our culture,\" and includes many \"puzzles\" for the curious. Despite his overall positive view of Lucas' oeuvre and the impact of the franchise on society, Sunstein had some criticism for the prequel films, and likened that to society at large:\n\n:The sky is always falling or the sky is always bright. In some ways, this is really morning in America and we don\u2019t see it. People are living longer, the economy is doing pretty well. On the other hand, there are some ways of thinking in the current situation that make it look not so good, including our Star Wars prequels\n\nSunstein compared ''Star Wars'' to his work for the Obama administration, saying that his approach to regulatory reform was very similar to Lucas' constrained approach to the movies as \"episodes.\"<ref>{{cite web |last1=McLevy |first1=Alex |title=Cass Sunstein explains why Star Wars is like America |url=https://film.avclub.com/cass-sunstein-explains-why-star-wars-is-like-america-1798248001 |publisher=AV Club |accessdate=30 March 2020}}</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nIn the 1980s and early 1990s, Sunstein was married to Lisa Ruddick, whom he met when both were undergraduates at Harvard.<ref>.https://books.google.com/books?id=m_mVWRPShyYC&pg=PR15&dq=cass+%22lisa+ruddick%22&hl=lt&sig=3rj5-V8-vIkWzjHp0FBqDgRchmY#PPR15,M1</ref> She is Associate Professor of English at the [[University of Chicago]], specializing in British modernism.<ref>.http://english.uchicago.edu/faculty/lisa-ruddick</ref> Their marriage ended in divorce.

From 1952 to 1956 she starred in several critically and commercially successful films, usually opposite male romantic leads 25 to 30 years older than she. In October 1953, she gained stardom from her performance in director [[John Ford]]'s African-filmed adventure-romance ''[[Mogambo]]'', starring [[Clark Gable]] and [[Ava Gardner]], which won her a [[Golden Globe Award]] and an [[Academy Award]] nomination for Best Supporting Actress. In 1954 she won the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]] for her deglamorized performance in the drama ''[[The Country Girl (1954 film)|The Country Girl]]'' with [[Bing Crosby]].<ref>{{cite web |title=1954 Academy Awards: Winners and History |url=http://www.filmsite.org/aa54.html |website=AMC Filmsite}}</ref> Other noteworthy films in which she starred include the western ''[[High Noon]]'' (1952), with [[Gary Cooper]]; the romance-comedy musical ''[[High Society (1956 film)|High Society]]'' (1956), with Bing Crosby and [[Frank Sinatra]]; and three [[Alfred Hitchcock]] suspense thrillers in rapid succession: ''[[Dial M for Murder]]'' (1954), with [[Ray Milland]]; ''[[Rear Window]]'' (1954), with [[James Stewart]]; and ''[[To Catch a Thief]]'' (1955), with [[Cary Grant]].  \n\nKelly retired from acting at the age of 26 to marry Rainier, and began her duties as [[List of Mon\u00e9gasque consorts|Princess of Monaco]]. It is well known that Hitchcock was hoping she would appear in more of his films which required an \"icy blonde\" lead actress, but he was unable to coax her out of retirement. Kelly and Rainier had three children: [[Caroline, Princess of Hanover|Princess Caroline]], [[Albert II, Prince of Monaco|Prince Albert]], and [[Princess St\u00e9phanie of Monaco|Princess St\u00e9phanie]].

Saint Bridget's was the East Falls parish where she was baptized and received her earliest education. Founded in 1853 by [[Saint John Neumann]], the fourth Bishop of Philadelphia, Saint Bridget's was at that time a relatively young parish, where families were very close to one another. While attending [[Ravenhill Academy]], a reputable Catholic girls' school, Kelly modeled fashions at local charity events with her mother and sisters. In 1942, at the age of 12, she played the lead in ''Don't Feed the Animals'', a play produced by the East Falls Old Academy Players.<ref name=\"leigh\" /> Before graduating in May 1947 from Stevens High School, a socially prominent private institution in nearby [[Chestnut Hill, Philadelphia|Chestnut Hill]], she acted and danced.

Owing to her low mathematics scores, Kelly was rejected by Bennington College in July 1947.<ref>{{harvnb|Leigh|2007|p=26}}</ref>\n\n== Career ==\n\n=== Early years ===\nDespite her parents' initial disapproval, Kelly decided to pursue her dreams of becoming an actress. John was particularly displeased with her decision; he viewed acting as \"a slim cut above streetwalker\".{{r|jacobs201005}} To start her career, she auditioned for the [[American Academy of Dramatic Arts]] in New York, using a scene from her uncle George Kelly's ''The Torch-Bearers'' (1923). Although the school had already met its semester quota, she obtained an interview with the admissions officer, Emile Diestel, and was admitted through the influence of George.{{r|jacobs201005}}\n\nKelly worked diligently, and practiced her speech by using a tape recorder. Her early acting pursuits led her to the stage, and she made her Broadway debut in [[August Strindberg|Strindberg]]'s ''[[The Father (Strindberg)|The Father]]'', alongside [[Raymond Massey]]. At 19, her graduation performance was as Tracy Lord in ''[[The Philadelphia Story (play)|The Philadelphia Story]]''.{{r|jacobs201005}}\n\nTelevision producer [[Delbert Mann]] cast Kelly as Bethel Merriday in an adaptation of the [[Sinclair Lewis]] novel of the same name; this was her first of nearly 60 live television programs.{{r|jacobs201005}} As a theater personality, she was mentioned in ''Theatre World'' magazine as: \"[a] most promising personality of the Broadway stage of 1950.\" Some of her well-known works as a theater actress were: ''The Father'', ''The Rockingham Tea Set'', ''The Apple Tree'', ''The Mirror of Delusion'', ''Episode'' (for [[Somerset Maugham]]'s tele-serial), among others.{{sfn|Spoto|2010|pages = 51\u201352}}\n\nSuccess on television eventually brought her a role in a major motion picture. Impressed by her work in ''The Father'', the director of the [[Twentieth Century-Fox]] film ''[[Fourteen Hours]]'' (1951), [[Henry Hathaway]], offered her a small role in the film. Kelly had a minor role, opposite [[Paul Douglas (actor)|Paul Douglas]], [[Richard Basehart]], and [[Barbara Bel Geddes]], as a young woman contemplating divorce.{{Sfn|Haugland|2006|p = 954}} Kelly's co-artist Paul Douglas commented of her acting in this film: \"In two senses, she did not have a bad side\u2013 you could film her from any angle, and she was one of the most un-temperamental cooperative people in the business.\"{{sfn|Spoto|2010|p = 56}} Following the release of this film, the \"Grace Kelly Fan Club\" was established. It became popular all over the United States, with local chapters springing up and attracting many members. Kelly referred to her fan club as \"terrifically amusing\".{{sfn|Spoto|2010|p = 56}}\n\nKelly was noticed during a visit to the set of ''Fourteen Hours'' by [[Gary Cooper]], who subsequently starred with her in ''[[High Noon]]'' (1952). He was charmed by her, and said that she was \"different from all these sexballs we've been seeing so much of\". However, Kelly's performance in ''Fourteen Hours'' was not noticed by critics, and did not lead to her receiving other film acting roles. She continued her work in the theater and on television,<ref name=\"leigh\" /> although she lacked \"vocal horsepower\", and would likely not have had a lengthy stage career.{{r|jacobs201005}}\n\n[[File:GraceKellyHighNoonTrailerScreenshot1952.jpg|thumb|left|Kelly in ''[[High Noon]]'' (1951), her first major film role]]\nKelly was performing in Colorado's [[Elitch Gardens]] when producer [[Stanley Kramer]] offered her a role co-starring opposite Gary Cooper in [[Fred Zinnemann]]'s ''High Noon'', a Western set in an historic old mining town in Columbia, California. She accepted the role, and the film was shot in the late summer/early fall of 1951 over a 28-day shooting schedule in hot weather conditions.

The magazine hailed her as the top movie star who brought about \"a startling change from the run of smoky film sirens and bumptious cuties\". She was described as the \"Girl in White Gloves\" because she wore \"prim and noticeable white gloves\", and journalists often called her the \"lady\" or \"Miss Kelly\" for this reason as well. In 1954, she appeared on the Best Dressed list, and in 1955, the Custom Tailored Guild of America listed her as the \"Best-Tailored Woman\".{{Sfn|Haugland|2006|p=960}}\n\nIn appreciation of her work with Hitchcock in three of his films, Kelly later wrote a foreword to the book ''The Art of Alfred Hitchcock'' by [[Donald Spoto]].

In 1983, following her death, Princess Caroline assumed the duties of President of the Board of Trustees of the Foundation; Prince Albert is Vice-President.<ref>[http://www.palais.mc/wwwpal.nsf/c3241c4782f528bdc1256d52004f970b/8a1843f4fb454d97c1256ba60045b973?OpenDocument Princess Grace Foundation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080503010748/http://www.palais.mc/wwwpal.nsf/c3241c4782f528bdc1256d52004f970b/8a1843f4fb454d97c1256ba60045b973?OpenDocument |date=May 3, 2008 }}</ref>\n\nFollowing Kelly's death, the Princess Grace Foundation-USA (PGF-USA) was established to continue the work she had done anonymously during her lifetime, assisting emerging theater, dance and film artists in America.

The Princess Grace Awards, a program of the Princess Grace Foundation-USA, has awarded nearly 800 artists at more than 100 institutions in the U.S. with more than $15&nbsp;million to date.

From 1952 to 1956 she starred in several critically and commercially successful films, usually opposite male romantic leads 25 to 30 years older than she. In October 1953, she gained stardom from her performance in director [[John Ford]]'s African-filmed adventure-romance ''[[Mogambo]]'', starring [[Clark Gable]] and [[Ava Gardner]], which won her a [[Golden Globe Award]] and an [[Academy Award]] nomination for Best Supporting Actress. In 1954 she won the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]] for her deglamorized performance in the drama ''[[The Country Girl (1954 film)|The Country Girl]]'' with [[Bing Crosby]].<ref>{{cite web |title=1954 Academy Awards: Winners and History |url=http://www.filmsite.org/aa54.html |website=AMC Filmsite}}</ref> Other noteworthy films in which she starred include the western ''[[High Noon]]'' (1952), with [[Gary Cooper]]; the romance-comedy musical ''[[High Society (1956 film)|High Society]]'' (1956), with Bing Crosby and [[Frank Sinatra]]; and three [[Alfred Hitchcock]] suspense thrillers in rapid succession: ''[[Dial M for Murder]]'' (1954), with [[Ray Milland]]; ''[[Rear Window]]'' (1954), with [[James Stewart]]; and ''[[To Catch a Thief]]'' (1955), with [[Cary Grant]].  \n\nKelly retired from acting at the age of 26 to marry Rainier, and began her duties as [[List of Mon\u00e9gasque consorts|Princess of Monaco]]. It is well known that Hitchcock was hoping she would appear in more of his films which required an \"icy blonde\" lead actress, but he was unable to coax her out of retirement.

Saint Bridget's was the East Falls parish where she was baptized and received her earliest education. Founded in 1853 by [[Saint John Neumann]], the fourth Bishop of Philadelphia, Saint Bridget's was at that time a relatively young parish, where families were very close to one another. While attending [[Ravenhill Academy]], a reputable Catholic girls' school, Kelly modeled fashions at local charity events with her mother and sisters.

John was particularly displeased with her decision; he viewed acting as \"a slim cut above streetwalker\".{{r|jacobs201005}} To start her career, she auditioned for the [[American Academy of Dramatic Arts]] in New York, using a scene from her uncle George Kelly's ''The Torch-Bearers'' (1923). Although the school had already met its semester quota, she obtained an interview with the admissions officer, Emile Diestel, and was admitted through the influence of George.{{r|jacobs201005}}\n\nKelly worked diligently, and practiced her speech by using a tape recorder. Her early acting pursuits led her to the stage, and she made her Broadway debut in [[August Strindberg|Strindberg]]'s ''[[The Father (Strindberg)|The Father]]'', alongside [[Raymond Massey]]. At 19, her graduation performance was as Tracy Lord in ''[[The Philadelphia Story (play)|The Philadelphia Story]]''.{{r|jacobs201005}}\n\nTelevision producer [[Delbert Mann]] cast Kelly as Bethel Merriday in an adaptation of the [[Sinclair Lewis]] novel of the same name; this was her first of nearly 60 live television programs.{{r|jacobs201005}} As a theater personality, she was mentioned in ''Theatre World'' magazine as: \"[a] most promising personality of the Broadway stage of 1950.\" Some of her well-known works as a theater actress were: ''The Father'', ''The Rockingham Tea Set'', ''The Apple Tree'', ''The Mirror of Delusion'', ''Episode'' (for [[Somerset Maugham]]'s tele-serial), among others.{{sfn|Spoto|2010|pages = 51\u201352}}\n\nSuccess on television eventually brought her a role in a major motion picture. Impressed by her work in ''The Father'', the director of the [[Twentieth Century-Fox]] film ''[[Fourteen Hours]]'' (1951), [[Henry Hathaway]], offered her a small role in the film. Kelly had a minor role, opposite [[Paul Douglas (actor)|Paul Douglas]], [[Richard Basehart]], and [[Barbara Bel Geddes]], as a young woman contemplating divorce.{{Sfn|Haugland|2006|p = 954}} Kelly's co-artist Paul Douglas commented of her acting in this film: \"In two senses, she did not have a bad side\u2013 you could film her from any angle, and she was one of the most un-temperamental cooperative people in the business.\"{{sfn|Spoto|2010|p = 56}} Following the release of this film, the \"Grace Kelly Fan Club\" was established. It became popular all over the United States, with local chapters springing up and attracting many members. Kelly referred to her fan club as \"terrifically amusing\".{{sfn|Spoto|2010|p = 56}}\n\nKelly was noticed during a visit to the set of ''Fourteen Hours'' by [[Gary Cooper]], who subsequently starred with her in ''[[High Noon]]'' (1952). He was charmed by her, and said that she was \"different from all these sexballs we've been seeing so much of\". However, Kelly's performance in ''Fourteen Hours'' was not noticed by critics, and did not lead to her receiving other film acting roles.

The magazine hailed her as the top movie star who brought about \"a startling change from the run of smoky film sirens and bumptious cuties\". She was described as the \"Girl in White Gloves\" because she wore \"prim and noticeable white gloves\", and journalists often called her the \"lady\" or \"Miss Kelly\" for this reason as well. In 1954, she appeared on the Best Dressed list, and in 1955, the Custom Tailored Guild of America listed her as the \"Best-Tailored Woman\".{{Sfn|Haugland|2006|p=960}}\n\nIn appreciation of her work with Hitchcock in three of his films, Kelly later wrote a foreword to the book ''The Art of Alfred Hitchcock'' by [[Donald Spoto]].

In 1983, following her death, Princess Caroline assumed the duties of President of the Board of Trustees of the Foundation; Prince Albert is Vice-President.<ref>[http://www.palais.mc/wwwpal.nsf/c3241c4782f528bdc1256d52004f970b/8a1843f4fb454d97c1256ba60045b973?OpenDocument Princess Grace Foundation] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080503010748/http://www.palais.mc/wwwpal.nsf/c3241c4782f528bdc1256d52004f970b/8a1843f4fb454d97c1256ba60045b973?OpenDocument |date=May 3, 2008 }}</ref>\n\nFollowing Kelly's death, the Princess Grace Foundation-USA (PGF-USA) was established to continue the work she had done anonymously during her lifetime, assisting emerging theater, dance and film artists in America.

The Princess Grace Awards, a program of the Princess Grace Foundation-USA, has awarded nearly 800 artists at more than 100 institutions in the U.S. with more than $15&nbsp;million to date.
