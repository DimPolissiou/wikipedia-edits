{"title_page": "Early life of Joseph Stalin", "text_new": "[[File:Stalin 1902.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Joseph Stalin in 1902, 23 years of age]]\nThe '''early life of Joseph Stalin''' covers the life of [[Joseph Stalin]] from his birth on 6 December 1878 (18 December, [[New Style]]) until the [[October Revolution]] on 23 October 1917 (7 November). Born Ioseb Jughashvili in [[Gori, Georgia]] to a cobbler and a house cleaner, he grew up in the city and attended school there before moving to [[Tiflis]] (modern-day Tbilisi) to join the [[Tbilisi Spiritual Seminary|Tiflis Seminary]]. While a student at the seminary he embraced Marxism and became an avid follower of [[Vladimir Lenin]], and left the seminary to become a revolutionary. After being marked by Russian [[Okhrana|secret police]] for his activities, he became a full-time revolutionary and outlaw. He became one of the [[Bolsheviks]]' chief operatives in the [[Caucasus]], organizing paramilitaries, spreading propaganda, raising money through bank robberies, and kidnappings and extortion. Stalin was captured and exiled to [[Siberia]] numerous times, but often escaped. He became one of Lenin's closest associates, which helped him rise to the heights of power after the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]]. In 1913 Stalin was exiled to Siberia for the final time, and remained in exile until the [[February Revolution]] of 1917 led to the overthrow of the [[Russian Empire]].\n\n==Childhood==\n\n===Childhood: 1878\u20131893===\n{{multiple image\n | total_width = 500\n | width1 = 407\n | height1 = 599\n | width2 = 425\n | height2 = 599\n | width3 = 255\n | height3 = 237\n | image1 = Stalin 1894.jpg\n | caption1 = Joseph, age 15\n | image2 = Vissarion Jughashvili.jpg\n | caption2 = Father, Besarion\n | image3 = Ekaterina Dzhugashvili.jpg\n | caption3 = Mother, Ekaterine\n }}\n[[File:Joseph Stalin birth registration crop.jpg|thumb|490px|right|Stalin's birth registration from the church records of Gori.]]\n\nStalin was born Ioseb Jughashvili on {{OldStyleDate|18 December|1878|6 December}}{{sfnm|1a1=Service|1y=2004|1p=14|2a1=Montefiore|2y=2007|2p=23}}{{efn|Official Soviet biographies listed Stalin's birthdate as 21 December 1879.

While a student at the seminary he embraced Marxism and became an avid follower of [[Vladimir Lenin]], and left the seminary to become a revolutionary. After being marked by Russian [[Okhrana|secret police]] for his activities, he became a full-time revolutionary and outlaw. He became one of the [[Bolsheviks]]' chief operatives in the [[Caucasus]], organizing paramilitaries, spreading propaganda, raising money through bank robberies, and kidnappings and extortion. Stalin was captured and exiled to [[Siberia]] numerous times, but often escaped. He became one of Lenin's closest associates, which helped him rise to the heights of power after the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]].

On 7 March 2009 Scattergood gave a live studio session on the BBC Radio 2 [[Dermot O'Leary]] show. Her cover version of \"[[Puff, the Magic Dragon]]\" proved to be popular with listeners, introducing many for the first time to the artist. An [[Extended play|EP]] of the iTunes performance was released in August 2009 on iTunes. She supported [[Amanda Palmer]] in September 2009 at [[Union Chapel, Islington]].\n\nIn 2011 Scattergood recorded a cover of New York New York for EA Games \"The Wall\" trailer.

The album was produced by Ken Thomas who has previously worked with Sigur Ros and M83 and consists of 10 songs, including singles,\"Disco Damaged Kid\"  \"Wanderlust\" and \"Cocoon\", as well as a reworked version of the previously available song, \"Silver Lining\". \"Disco Damaged Kid\" won the public vote on 6 Music's roundtable. \"Wanderlust\" was remixed by Charli XCX and \"How To Dress Well\" featured in America's Billboard Magazine. The album was well received and awarded four stars by ''Mojo'', ''The Independent'' and ''Rolling Stone'' Magazine.\n\nScattergood supported Mute labelmates [[Goldfrapp]] at the summer series 2013 concerts at Somerset House, London on 20 July 2013. She also played two sold out nights at London's Madam Jojo's.\n\nAfter Arrows was released Scattergood decided to team up with her label mate James Chapman, aka the Mercury Nominated artist Maps, to write and record a joint project, entitled \"onDeadWaves\".<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://mute.com/artists/on-dead-waves|title=MUTE \u2022 Artists \u2022 On Dead Waves|work=MUTE|access-date=5 July 2018}}</ref>\n\nThe seeds of this creative partnership were sown in 2011 at a special [[Mute Records|Mute]] label night at London's [[Roundhouse (venue)|Roundhouse]].

These blockchains serve as a distributed version of [[multiversion concurrency control]] (MVCC) in databases.{{R|t4}} Just as MVCC prevents two transactions from concurrently modifying a single object in a database, blockchains prevent two transactions from spending the same single output in a blockchain.<ref name=\"tapscott201605\" />{{rp|30\u201331}} Opponents say that permissioned systems resemble traditional corporate databases, not supporting decentralized data verification, and that such systems are not hardened against operator tampering and revision.{{R|t16|t11}} Nikolai Hampton of ''[[Computerworld]]'' said that \"many in-house blockchain solutions will be nothing more than cumbersome databases,\" and \"without a clear security model, proprietary blockchains should be eyed with suspicion.\"<ref name=cw20160905/><ref name=\"MarTech\">{{cite news |last1=Barry |first1=Levine |title=A new report bursts the blockchain bubble |url=https://martechtoday.com/a-new-report-bursts-the-blockchain-bubble-216959 |accessdate=13 July 2018 |publisher=MarTech |date=11 June 2018}}</ref>\n\n==== Permissionless ====\nThe great advantage to an open, permissionless, or public, blockchain network is that guarding against bad actors is not required and no [[access control]] is needed.<ref name=\"bsm\"/> This means that applications can be added to the network without the approval or trust of others, using the blockchain as a [[transport layer]].<ref name=\"bsm\"/>\n\nBitcoin and other cryptocurrencies currently secure their blockchain by requiring new entries to include a proof of work.

There is never an absolute guarantee that any particular entry will remain in the best version of the history forever. Blockchains are typically built to add the score of new blocks onto old blocks and are given incentives to extend with new blocks rather than overwrite old blocks. Therefore, the probability of an entry becoming superseded decreases exponentially<ref name=\"bsm\">{{cite web |url=http://radar.oreilly.com/2014/02/bitcoin-security-model-trust-by-computation.html |title=Bitcoin security model: trust by computation |first=Andreas |last=Antonopoulos |date=20 February 2014 |website=Radar |publisher=O'Reilly |accessdate=19 November 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161031132328/http://radar.oreilly.com/2014/02/bitcoin-security-model-trust-by-computation.html |archivedate=31 October 2016  }}</ref> as more blocks are built on top of it, eventually becoming very low.{{R|te20151031}}{{r|t12|p=ch. 08}}{{r|paper}} For example, bitcoin uses a [[proof-of-work system]], where the chain with the most cumulative proof-of-work is considered the valid one by the network.

Some blockchains create a new block as frequently as every five seconds. By the time of block completion, the included data becomes verifiable. In cryptocurrency, this is practically when the transaction takes place, so a shorter block time means faster transactions. The block time for [[Ethereum]] is set to between 14 and 15 seconds, while for bitcoin it is on average 10 minutes.{{citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\n==== Hard forks ====\n{{Excerpt|Fork (blockchain)|Hard fork}}\n\n=== Decentralization ===\nBy storing data across its peer-to-peer network, the blockchain eliminates a number of risks that come with data being held centrally.{{R|te20151031}} The decentralized blockchain may use [[ad hoc]] [[message passing]] and [[distributed networking]].\n\nPeer-to-peer blockchain networks lack centralized points of vulnerability that [[Security hacker|computer crackers]] can exploit; likewise, it has no central point of [[failure]]. Blockchain security methods include the use of [[public-key cryptography]].{{r|primer|p=5}} A ''public key'' (a long, random-looking string of numbers) is an address on the blockchain. Value tokens sent across the network are recorded as belonging to that address. A ''private key'' is like a password that gives its owner access to their digital assets or the means to otherwise interact with the various capabilities that blockchains now support. Data stored on the blockchain is generally considered incorruptible.{{R|te20151031}}\n\nEvery [[Node (networking)|node]] in a decentralized system has a copy of the blockchain.

Because all early blockchains were permissionless, controversy has arisen over the blockchain definition. An issue in this ongoing debate is whether a private system with verifiers tasked and authorized (permissioned) by a central authority should be considered a blockchain.{{R|t16|t10|t11|t8|t9}} Proponents of permissioned or private chains argue that the term \"blockchain\" may be applied to any data structure that batches data into time-stamped blocks. These blockchains serve as a distributed version of [[multiversion concurrency control]] (MVCC) in databases.{{R|t4}} Just as MVCC prevents two transactions from concurrently modifying a single object in a database, blockchains prevent two transactions from spending the same single output in a blockchain.<ref name=\"tapscott201605\" />{{rp|30\u201331}} Opponents say that permissioned systems resemble traditional corporate databases, not supporting decentralized data verification, and that such systems are not hardened against operator tampering and revision.{{R|t16|t11}} Nikolai Hampton of ''[[Computerworld]]'' said that \"many in-house blockchain solutions will be nothing more than cumbersome databases,\" and \"without a clear security model, proprietary blockchains should be eyed with suspicion.\"<ref name=cw20160905/><ref name=\"MarTech\">{{cite news |last1=Barry |first1=Levine |title=A new report bursts the blockchain bubble |url=https://martechtoday.com/a-new-report-bursts-the-blockchain-bubble-216959 |accessdate=13 July 2018 |publisher=MarTech |date=11 June 2018}}</ref>\n\n==== Permissionless ====\nThe great advantage to an open, permissionless, or public, blockchain network is that guarding against bad actors is not required and no [[access control]] is needed.<ref name=\"bsm\"/> This means that applications can be added to the network without the approval or trust of others, using the blockchain as a [[transport layer]].<ref name=\"bsm\"/>\n\nBitcoin and other cryptocurrencies currently secure their blockchain by requiring new entries to include a proof of work.

It is the oldest [[experimental theatre]] group in the United States.{{citation needed|date=December 2014}} For most of its history it was led by its founders, actress [[Judith Malina]] and painter/poet [[Julian Beck]]; after Beck's death in 1985, company member [[Hanon Reznikov]] became co-director with Malina.<ref>[[Gary Botting|Botting, Gary]], ''The Theatre of Protest in America'', Edmonton: Harden House, 1972.</ref> After Malina's death in 2015, her responsibilities were taken over by the anarchist company. The Living Theatre and its founders were the subject of the 1983 documentary ''[[Signals Through The Flames (film)|Signals Through The Flames]]''.\n\n== History ==\n\nIn the 1950s, the group was among the first in the U.S. to produce the work of influential European playwrights such as [[Bertolt Brecht]] (''[[In The Jungle of Cities]]'' in New York, 1960) and [[Jean Cocteau]], as well as [[modernism|modernist]] poets such as [[T. S. Eliot]] and [[Gertrude Stein]]. One of their first major productions was [[Pablo Picasso]]'s ''[[Desire Caught By the Tail]]''; other early productions were ''Many Loves'' by [[William Carlos Williams]] and [[Luigi Pirandello|Luigi Pirandello's]] ''Tonight We Improvise''.<ref name=Botting18>Botting, Gary, \"The Living Theatre\", in ''The Theatre of Protest in America'' (Edmonton: Harden House, 1972), 18.</ref> Based in a variety of small New York locations which were frequently closed due to financial problems or conflicts with city authorities, they helped to originate [[off-off-Broadway]] and [[off-Broadway]] as significant forces in U.S. theater. Their work during this period shared some aspects of style and content with [[Beat generation]] writers.

Atlanta would have to win six games, and Montreal would have to lose six games, to tie for first. The leading team is zero games behind itself, and this is indicated in standings by a dash, not a zero.\n<center>{{1994 NL East standings}}</center>\n\n==Computing games behind==\nGames behind is calculated by using either of the following formulas, in which Team A is a leading team, and Team B is a trailing team. Example math in this section uses the above standings, with Montreal as Team A and Atlanta as Team B.\n\n:<math>\\text{Games Behind} = \\frac{(\\text{Team A's wins \u2013 Team A's losses}) - (\\text{Team B's wins \u2013 Team B's losses})}{2}</math>\n\n:<math>\\text{Games Behind} = \\frac{(\\text{74 \u2013 40}) - (\\text{68 \u2013 46})}{2} = \\frac{\\text{34 \u2013 22}}{2} = \\frac{12}{2} = 6</math>\n\nAlternately:\n:<math>\\text{Games Behind} = \\frac{(\\text{Team A's wins \u2013 Team B's wins}) + (\\text{Team B's losses \u2013 Team A's losses})}{2}</math>\n\n:<math>\\text{Games Behind} = \\frac{(\\text{74 \u2013 68}) + (\\text{46 \u2013 40})}{2} = \\frac{\\text{6 + 6}}{2} = \\frac{12}{2} = 6</math>\n\nNotes:\n* It can alternately be said that Montreal is six ''games ahead'' of Atlanta.\n* A games behind situation can change rapidly when two teams contesting for the lead play each other. For example, Atlanta could cut Montreal's lead in half (to three games) by sweeping a three-game head-to-head series.\n* The leading team, in terms of games behind, is the team with the best won\u2013loss ''difference''. This is not always the team with the most wins. For example, a team with an 80\u201370 record (10 more wins than losses) would be one game behind a team with a 79\u201367 record (12 more wins than losses).\n\n==Anomalies==\nThe formulas implicitly treat any difference in the number of games played by the two teams as each unplayed game being \"worth\" 0.5 wins and 0.5 losses. This can lead to anomalies when teams have played an unequal number of games, especially during the early portion of a season.\n\n* Two teams with different [[winning percentage]]s may be tied in terms of games behind. For example, Team A at 6\u20134 would be tied with Team B at 4\u20132, in terms of games behind. However, Team B has the better winning percentage, at .667 compared to .600 for Team A.\n* A team with a lower winning percentage may lead (in terms of games behind) a team with a higher winning percentage. For example, Team A at 6\u20134 would lead Team B at 2\u20131 by a half-game when calculating games behind. However, Team B has the better winning percentage at .667, compared to .600 for Team A.\n\n::An example of this occurred in May 2018, when the [[New York Yankees]] were 28\u201313 and the [[Boston Red Sox]] were 30\u201314. The ''games behind'' calculation had New York a half-game behind Boston; however, New York had the better winning percentage, at .683 compared to .682 for Boston.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/?year=2018&month=05&day=17 |title=MLB Scores and Standings |website=[[Baseball-Reference.com]] |date=May 17, 2018 |accessdate=November 9, 2018}}</ref>\n::Also, on December 28, 2018, in the [[National Basketball Association]], the 24\u201310 [[Milwaukee Bucks]] were a half-game behind the 26\u201311 [[Toronto Raptors]].

Following this change, it became common for the media to publish an additional set of standings for the wild card race. It included all teams from a league, with the exception of the division leaders, and games behind was calculated with respect to the team with the highest standing in the wild card race.\n\nIn the [[2012 Major League Baseball season|2012 MLB season]], both leagues added a second wild card team. Now, games behind in the wild card race is calculated with respect to the team with ''second highest'' standing in the wild card race. MLB's website distinguishes this statistic as ''wild card games behind'', abbreviated WCGB. Assuming that teams are not tied for first place in the wild card race, this results in the team leading the wild card race being shown as some number of \"games ahead\" of the second place team, indicated by a plus sign (\"+\") in the standings. As an example, see the [[:Template:2012 NL Wild Card standings|2012 NL Wild Card standings]], which shows the [[Atlanta Braves]] six games ahead of the [[St. Louis Cardinals]].\n\n===National Basketball Association===\n[[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) standings typically report games behind within each five-team division. However, it is not as closely followed as in baseball, because more teams qualify for the NBA playoffs, and the divisional statistics are not as important for playoff qualification. Sometimes, especially nearing the end of the regular season, games behind will be given with respect to the eighth position in the [[Eastern Conference (NBA)|Eastern Conference]] and [[Western Conference (NBA)|Western Conference]], as the eighth position is the last to qualify for the playoffs in each conference.\n\n===National Football League===\n[[File:NFL_Standings_23Oct1972.png|thumb|right|NFL standings in October 1972 as published in the ''[[Tampa Bay Times]]'']]\n[[National Football League]] (NFL) standings sometimes report games behind, although the statistic is not emphasized; winning percentage is used, computed from each team's win\u2013loss\u2013tie record. This is especially true since the introduction of the bye week in [[1990 NFL season|1990]], exacerbating differences in the number of games that teams have played at various points in time. Games behind is omitted from standings on the NFL's website and is absent from most published standings.\n\n===Other sports===\nThe games behind statistic is eschewed in sports where tie games are traditionally common, such as the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) and [[Major League Soccer]] (MLS). Leagues in these sports typically rank teams by awarding a certain number of points for each win or tie. The [[Canadian Football League]] (CFL) also does not use games behind, and awards standings points.\n\n===Related usage===\nTeams are sometimes referred to as being over or under \"five hundred\", in comparison to a [[Winning percentage#500|.500]] winning percentage. The calculation for this is simple subtraction (there is no division by two).  For example, a team at 55\u201350 is \"five games over five hundred\", while a team at 40\u201350 would be \"ten games under five hundred\". 'Above' and 'below' can be substituted for 'over' and 'under', respectively.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Magic number (sports)]], the number of wins needed to clinch a championship\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*[http://www.baseballprospectus.com/glossary/index.php?search=gb GB glossary entry] at baseballprospectus.com\n\n[[Category:Sports terminology]]\n[[Category:Sports records and statistics]]\n", "text_old": "{{distinguish|Game in hand}}\n{{more citations needed|date=November 2018}}\n[[File:Red Sox 2007.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.4|A partial view of the [[Green Monster]] at [[Fenway Park]], with standings for the [[American League East]] division, including a \"GB\" column]]\nIn most North American sports, the phrase '''games behind''' or '''games back''' (often abbreviated '''GB''') is a common way to reflect the gap between a leading team and another team in a sports league, conference, or division.\n\n==Example==\nIn the below standings from the [[1994 Major League Baseball season]], the [[Atlanta Braves]] are six ''games behind'' the [[Montreal Expos]]. Atlanta would have to win six games, and Montreal would have to lose six games, to tie for first. The leading team is zero games behind itself, and this is indicated in standings by a dash, not a zero.\n<center>{{1994 NL East standings}}</center>\n\n==Computing games behind==\nGames behind is calculated by using either of the following formulas, in which Team A is a leading team, and Team B is a trailing team. Example math in this section uses the above standings, with Montreal as Team A and Atlanta as Team B.\n\n:<math>\\text{Games Behind} = \\frac{(\\text{Team A's wins \u2013 Team A's losses}) - (\\text{Team B's wins \u2013 Team B's losses})}{2}</math>\n\n:<math>\\text{Games Behind} = \\frac{(\\text{74 \u2013 40}) - (\\text{68 \u2013 46})}{2} = \\frac{\\text{34 \u2013 22}}{2} = \\frac{12}{2} = 6</math>\n\nAlternately:\n:<math>\\text{Games Behind} = \\frac{(\\text{Team A's wins \u2013 Team B's wins}) + (\\text{Team B's losses \u2013 Team A's losses})}{2}</math>\n\n:<math>\\text{Games Behind} = \\frac{(\\text{74 \u2013 68}) + (\\text{46 \u2013 40})}{2} = \\frac{\\text{6 + 6}}{2} = \\frac{12}{2} = 6</math>\n\nNotes:\n* It can alternately be said that Montreal is six ''games ahead'' of Atlanta.\n* A games behind situation can change rapidly when two teams contesting for the lead play each other. For example, Atlanta could cut Montreal's lead in half (to three games) by sweeping a three-game head-to-head series.\n* The leading team, in terms of games behind, is the team with the best won\u2013loss ''difference''. This is not always the team with the most wins. For example, a team with an 80\u201370 record (10 more wins than losses) would be one game behind a team with a 79\u201367 record (12 more wins than losses).\n\n==Anomalies==\nThe formulas implicitly treat any difference in the number of games played by the two teams as each unplayed game being \"worth\" 0.5 wins and 0.5 losses. This can lead to anomalies when teams have played an unequal number of games, especially during the early portion of a season.\n\n* Two teams with different [[winning percentage]]s may be tied in terms of games behind. For example, Team A at 6\u20134 would be tied with Team B at 4\u20132, in terms of games behind. However, Team B has the better winning percentage, at .667 compared to .600 for Team A.\n* A team with a lower winning percentage may lead (in terms of games behind) a team with a higher winning percentage. For example, Team A at 6\u20134 would lead Team B at 2\u20131 by a half-game when calculating games behind. However, Team B has the better winning percentage at .667, compared to .600 for Team A.\n\n::An example of this occurred in May 2018, when the [[New York Yankees]] were 28\u201313 and the [[Boston Red Sox]] were 30\u201314. The ''games behind'' calculation had New York a half-game behind Boston; however, New York had the better winning percentage, at .683 compared to .682 for Boston.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/?year=2018&month=05&day=17 |title=MLB Scores and Standings |website=[[Baseball-Reference.com]] |date=May 17, 2018 |accessdate=November 9, 2018}}</ref>\n::Also, on December 28, 2018, in the [[National Basketball Association]], the 24\u201310 [[Milwaukee Bucks]] were a half-game behind the 26\u201311 [[Toronto Raptors]].
