Klass dismissed theories that the documents were part of a disinformation campaign as \"ridiculous\", saying they contained numerous flaws that could never fool Soviet or Chinese intelligence. Other discrepancies noted by Klass included the use of a distinctive date format that matched one used in Moore's personal letters, and a conversation reported by Brad Sparks in which Moore confided that he was contemplating creating and releasing some hoax Top Secret documents in hopes that such bogus documents would encourage former military and intelligence officials who knew about the government's (alleged) UFO coverup to break their oaths of secrecy.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Klass|first1=Philip|title=The New Bogus Majestic-12 Documents|url=http://www.csicop.org/si/show/new_bogus_majestic-12_documents|website=CSI|accessdate=10 July 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe FBI began its own investigation of the supposed \"secret\" documents and quickly formed doubts as to their authenticity.

Klass dismissed theories that the documents were part of a disinformation campaign as \"ridiculous\", saying they contained numerous flaws that could never fool Soviet or Chinese intelligence. Other discrepancies noted by Klass included the use of a distinctive date format that matched one used in Moore's personal letters, and a conversation reported by Brad Sparks in which Moore confided that he was contemplating creating and releasing some hoax Top Secret documents in hopes that such bogus documents would encourage former military and intelligence officials who knew about the government's (alleged) UFO coverup to break their oaths of secrecy.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Klass|first1=Philip|title=The New Bogus Majestic-12 Documents|url=http://www.csicop.org/si/show/new_bogus_majestic-12_documents|website=CSI|accessdate=10 July 2017}}</ref>\n\nThe FBI began its own investigation of the supposed \"secret\" documents and quickly formed doubts as to their authenticity.

This story, published in ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #144 (May 1975), initiated the [[Clone Saga#The original Clone Saga|original Clone Saga]]. At the end of that story, Gwen's clone, a creation of Spider-Man villain the [[Jackal (Marvel Comics)|Jackal]], leaves to find a new life for herself, coming to accept that she is not really the same person who had a relationship with Peter Parker.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #149</ref>\n\nIn the 1988 crossover \"[[The Evolutionary War]]\", the [[High Evolutionary]], who had once been Miles Warren's teacher, captures Gwen's clone. He is dismayed to learn that Miles Warren has perfected the art of cloning and thus lies to the New Men that it was nothing more than a genetic construct created by a virus that he injected into his apprentice, Joyce Delaney.{{issue|date=December 2012}}\n\nDuring the second \"[[Clone Saga]]\", Gwen Stacy's clone, now married to a clone of Professor Warren named Warren Miles, sees a copy of Peter Parker's book of Spider-Man photos, ''Webs'', and remembers (to an extent) her real history. She returns to New York City. During this storyline, she again disappears from Spider-Man's life. It was revealed the Gwen Stacy clone introduced in ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #144 was in fact the second Gwen clone Miles Warren created and has been living in London under the name Joyce Delaney. This clone is murdered by the Gwen Stacy clone known as Abby-L.<ref>''Spider-Island Deadly Foes'' #1</ref>\n\nAnother Gwen clone appears in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #399 (March 1995).

She joins the Jackal (alongside [[Carrion (comics)|Carrion]] and a regular Miles Warren clone) in capturing [[Superior Spider-Man]] and [[Kaine Parker|Kaine]].<ref>''Superior Spider-Man Team-Up'' #2</ref> She is sympathetic towards \"Peter\" and Kaine, but at the same time utterly loyal to the Jackal. When the Spiders break free, Superior Spider-Man disarms and attempts to kill her, but is stopped by Kaine. When the Jackal's lab is engulfed in flames, Kaine offers to save her, but she refuses, and is seemingly consumed by the fire.<ref>''Scarlet Spider'' (Vol. 2) #20</ref>\n\n===''Dead No More: The Clone Conspiracy''===\nIn the ''[[Dead No More: The Clone Conspiracy|Clone Conspiracy]]'' storyline, a flashback revealed that Gwen Stacy was conscious during Spider-Man and Green Goblin's battle on the bridge, and as she was falling to her death. She overheard their conversation and discovered Peter is Spider-Man in the process. She was angry at Peter for keeping this secret and for his involvement in her father's death.<ref name=\"clone conspiracy 1\">''The Clone Conspiracy #1''</ref>\n\nIn the present, Gwen is supposedly revived by the [[Ben Reilly|Jackal]] with his clones. The Jackal claims that this one is not a clone but the real Gwen who was harvested and reanimated from her remains and still has all her memories, including those of her death. The Jackal offers Gwen the opportunity to be his business partner as he tries to change the world with his new technology. Gwen is hesitant about this new life at first but accepts it when the Jackal shows that he has reanimated the clone of her father, who is in much better health than he was before he died.<ref name=\"clone conspiracy 1\"/> When Spider-Man arrives at the incorporation and discovers the Jackal's experiments, he is surprised by Gwen's presence and notes that unlike the other people the Jackal revived, who were all clones, Gwen does not trigger his spider sense, making him wonder if she was the real one. He is attacked by the \"reborn\" [[Doctor Octopus]] before he can question the issue further.<ref name=\"clone conspiracy 1\"/>\n\nAfter the Jackal breaks up the fight and shows Spider-Man around the New U, the George Stacy clone recognizes something off about Gwen's face and points his gun at her. It is revealed that the Gwen clone was actually her Earth-65 counterpart [[Spider-Woman (Gwen Stacy)|Spider-Woman]] who assists Spider-Man in escaping. The real Gwen is kidnapped by [[Kaine Parker|Kaine]] and taken to [[Parker Industries]] to be studied. Kaine reveals that he and Spider-Woman came to this Earth to assist Spider-Man because they saw that Spider-Man agreeing with the Jackal's offer on other worlds always results in a global disaster.<ref>''The Clone Conspiracy'' #2</ref> Rhino and Electro are sent to retrieve Gwen after attacking the staff, but Gwen tells them to take Kaine with him too because his condition could help with Jackal's experiments. Anna Maria Marconi also volunteers to come with because she has studied both Kaine and the drug.<ref>''The Clone Conspiracy'' #3</ref>\n\nWhen Spider-Man is taken to Haven, he catches up with Gwen in the household in the facility, where she tries to convince him to support New U Technologies. Peter still has a hard time believing she is the real Gwen given his other experiences with clones. Gwen tries justifying her existence by telling Peter her memories, including how she overheard the Green Goblin talking to Spider-Man before her death.

During the fight, Gwen is shown to be able to use her symbiote to fight off Eddie but Eddie reabsorbs his symbiote along with the Carnage symbiote rendering Gwen Stacy an average girl. After a series of tests, it is concluded that this Gwen is not a clone but consciously and genetically is the genuine article now reborn (though Gwen's original body died, the Carnage symbiote absorbed her being and they had bonded since her death). After SHIELD intervenes, SHIELD Director Danvers states Gwen will remain in S.H.I.E.L.D. custody. Peter and May argue for her to come back to live with them, with Tony Stark supporting the Parkers. In ''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #129, the Parkers are now helping to rebuild Gwen's life.

In \"Return to the Spider-Verse\" [Pt. 4], she aids [[Spider-Man]] and Kid Arachnid in the final battle against Wolf-Spider. \n* Gwen Stacy appears in the 2017 ''[[Spider-Man (2017 TV series)|Spider-Man]]'' animated series,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nerdspan.com/spider-man-2017-cartoon-venom-spider-gwen-and-miles-morales/|title=SPIDER-MAN 2017 CARTOON WILL FEATURE VENOM, SPIDER-GWEN, AND MILES MORALES|publisher=Nerdspan|last=Rey|first=Leo|date=December 18, 2016}}</ref> voiced by [[Laura Bailey (voice actress)|Laura Bailey]].<ref>{{cite tweet|user=Marvel|author=Marvel Entertainment|number=886036735003467776|date=15 July 2017|title=The #MarvelAnimation panel is underway, and the cast of \"Marvel's #SpiderMan\" has just been announced! 1/3}}</ref> This version is one of Peter Parker's classmates at Horizon High and specializes in DNA formulas. She was inspired to pursue science by her uncle Raymond Warren who is later revealed to be the villainous [[Jackal (comics)|Jackal]]. In the \"Spider Island\" event, she becomes Spider-Gwen after being exposed to the Jackal's chemicals and assists Spider-Man as a hero, but is later mutated into a giant spider as the experiment starts affecting the rest of New York (similar to [[Carlie Cooper]]'s role in the original story). She is later cured in the climax of the story. In \"The Day Without Spider-Man\", she regains her powers thanks to exposure to a crystal called the Bloodgem and becomes Ghost-Spider during the fight against Scorpion and Tinkerer.\n\n===Film===\n====Sam Raimi series====\n* A student in Peter Parker's university class in ''[[Spider-Man 2]]'', portrayed by [[Brianna Brown]], is identified as Gwen Stacy in the film's novelization.\n* Gwen Stacy is portrayed by [[Bryce Dallas Howard]] in ''[[Spider-Man 3]]''. In this film's version, she is [[Eddie Brock|Eddie]]\u2019s [[Romantic interest|love interest]] before [[Spider-Man|Peter]], serving as an unintended rival to [[Mary Jane Watson]]. Gwen is a classmate and lab partner of Peter Parker, until Spider-Man rescues her early in the film from a construction crane accident. She kisses an upside-down Spider-Man in similar fashion to how Mary Jane did in ''[[Spider-Man (2002 film)|Spider-Man]]'' which causes Mary Jane to become angry and hurt. As Peter is at the top of [[Lizard (comics)|Dr. Connors]]'s [[quantum mechanics]] class, he tutors her. She considers Peter a [[genius]] and is very fond of him. She is also friends with [[Eddie Brock]] as he took pictures of her so Gwen could be a model. Brock's relationship is short-lived, as Peter, under the influence of the symbiote, steals her from Eddie. He dances with her at the same jazz club where Mary Jane works, but Gwen realizes Peter is doing this to make Mary Jane jealous. Gwen, upset about this, approaches Mary Jane, apologizes, and storms out of the club, leaving Peter behind. She is later present at [[Harry Osborn]]'s funeral.\n* [[Bryce Dallas Howard]] said she would love to be a part of any continuation of the film franchise, while acknowledging her character's opportunity may have passed, especially after ''Spider-Man 3'' ended with Peter and Mary Jane once again in each other's arms. In May 2007, actor [[James Cromwell]], who played Captain Stacy in the film stated he thought the natural progression for the character would be for both to die early in ''[[Spider-Man 4]]'', mirroring the comics. Howard said a death would not have bothered her. The film was ultimately unmade, although Stacy was in the draft.\n\n====Marc Webb series====\n* [[Emma Stone]] portrays Gwen Stacy in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man (2012 film)|The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' as Peter Parker's love interest. She works as an assistant at Dr. Curt Connors's laboratory at [[Oscorp]], where Peter is bitten by a genetically-engineered spider. She subsequently develops a crush on him, and he soon reveals his secret identity as Spider-Man to her. Gwen plays an important role in the [[Lizard (comics)|Lizard]]'s defeat, by helping Peter develop an antidote for the serum that mutates people into reptilian hybrids through cross-species genetics, using her own scientific background. Her father is killed by the Lizard before Peter can defeat the villain. George begs Peter to keep Gwen out of his dangerous life. Peter honors that vow without telling Gwen immediately; this affronts Gwen until she realizes what her father did, and subsequently forgives Peter. However, when Peter later wonders if he should keep that promise, she just smiles.\n* Emma Stone reprises her role as Gwen Stacy in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man 2]]''. Gwen continues to work at Oscorp, which is owned by [[Harry Osborn]], Peter's best friend. By now, Peter and Gwen have decided to keep their relationship platonic, but Peter's romantic feelings for her are rekindled when she tells him that she is going to [[England]] to study medicine at [[Somerville College, Oxford|Somerville College]], [[Oxford University]]. When Oscorp employee Max Dillon suffers an industrial accident and becomes the villain [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]], Gwen starts asking questions; Donald Menken, a high ranking and mutinous Oscorp board member, decides that she is a threat, fires her and targets her for elimination. When Electro attacks the city's electricity supply, Gwen and Spider-Man work together to stop him. Just then, the Green Goblin kidnaps Gwen and holds her hostage atop of the power plant's clock tower, intent on drawing Spider-Man out. The Green Goblin throws Gwen through the tower's glass rooftop, but Spider-Man saves her by shooting a web for her to grab onto. The web eventually breaks, however, and Gwen falls to the ground far below. Spider-Man catches her with another web an instant too late, as her head hits the concrete floor, killing her instantly. Gwen's death sends Peter into a deep depression, and he decides to give up being Spider-Man. Five months later, he watches a video of Gwen's graduation speech, in which she tells her class that hope is what makes life worth living, even in the darkest of times. Inspired, Peter decides to once again become Spider-Man. As [[viral marketing]] for the film, a [[Tumblr]] page was created for the character.<ref>http://missgwen-stacy.tumblr.com/</ref>\n* In both films, [[Kari Coleman]], Charlie DePew, [[Skyler Gisondo]] and Jacob Rodier portray the Stacy family: Helen Stacy (Gwen's mom), Philip Stacy, Howard Stacy, and Simon Stacy (Gwen's younger brothers) respectively.\n\n===Literature===\n* Although she does not appear directly, Gwen's death plays an important role in ''Revenge of the Sinister Six'' by [[Adam-Troy Castro]], the second part of his ''[[Sinister Six]]'' trilogy, when [[Mysterio]] (posing as [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]]) takes hostages on the same bridge where Gwen died, using a holographic projection of Gwen's death stuck on a loop to put Spider-Man at a psychological disadvantage. After Spider-Man drives Mysterio away, he takes a moment beside the hologram projector to mourn Gwen's death.\n\n===Video games===\n* Gwen Stacy is briefly mentioned in ''[[Spider-Man: Edge of Time]]''. When a futuristic version of Peter Parker reveals plans to [[Spider-Man 2099]], Alchemex's CEO mentions wanting to save the lives of [[Uncle Ben|Ben Parker]], Gwen, [[George Stacy]] and countless others.\n* Gwen Stacy appears in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man (2012 video game)|The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' video game, voiced by [[Kari Wahlgren]].\n* Gwen Stacy makes her debut as a playable character in ''[[Lego Marvel Super Heroes]]'', voiced again by Kari Wahlgren.\n* Gwen Stacy is playable once again in ''[[Lego Marvel Super Heroes 2]]'' and can switch into her Spider-Gwen persona.\n\n==See also==\n* ''[[The Night Gwen Stacy Died]]''\n* [[Spider-Man supporting characters]]\n* [[Spider-Woman (Gwen Stacy)]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://marvel.wikia.com/wiki/Gwendolyne_Stacy_(Earth-616) Gwen Stacy in Marvel Comics Database]\n*[http://www.maelmill-insi.de/UHBMCC/ The Unofficial Handbook of Marvel Comics Creators]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuVpwjYgvgg&mode=related&search=/ Physics of Superheroes 1 - Death of Gwen Stacy]\n*[http://www.spiderfan.org/characters/gwen_stacy.html Spiderfan.org &ndash; Gwen Stacy]\n{{Spider-Man characters}}\n{{Spider-Man}}\n{{Symbiote Family and Hosts}}\n{{Ultimate Spider-Man}}\n{{Spectacular Spider-Man (TV series)}}\n{{Stan Lee}}\n{{Goblin (Marvel Comics)}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Stacy, Gwen}}\n[[Category:Characters created by Stan Lee]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Steve Ditko]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1965]]\n[[Category:Female characters in comics]]\n[[Category:Female characters in film]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters from New York City]]\n[[Category:Fictional models]]\n[[Category:Fictional victims of kidnapping]]\n[[Category:Fictional murdered people in comics]]\n[[Category:Spider-Man characters]]\n[[Category:Teenage characters in film]]\n\n[[sv:Spider-Man#V\u00e4nner]]\n", "text_old": "{{short description|Fictional Marvel Comics character}}\n{{About||the alternate-universe superhero version|Spider-Woman (Gwen Stacy)|the comic-book series starring the alternate-universe superhero version|Spider-Gwen|the Christian metalcore band|Gwen Stacy (band)}}\n{{Infobox comics character<!--Wikipedia:WikiProject Comics-->\n|image=Gwen Stacy (circa 2020).png\n|converted=y\n|caption= Artwork of the cover of ''Gwen Stacy'' #1 (February 2020)<br /> Art by [[Adam Hughes]]\n|character_name=Gwen Stacy\n|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]\n|debut=''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #31 (December 1965)\n|creators=[[Stan Lee]]<br />[[Steve Ditko]]\n|full_name=Gwendolyne Maxine Stacy<ref name=\"middle_name\">Gwen Stacy states her full name as \"Gwen Maxine Stacy\" in ''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #127.</ref> \n|species= [[Human]]\n|homeworld= [[New York City]]\n|aliases= [[Spider-Woman (Gwen Stacy)|Spider-Gwen]]\n|supports=[[Spider-Man]] <br />[[Ultimate Spider-Man]] <br />[[Ultimate Spider-Woman]] <br />[[Dead Girl (comics)|Dead Girl]]\n}}\n'''Gwendolyne Maxine Stacy'''<ref name=\"middle_name\" /> is a [[fictional]] character who appears in American [[comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]], usually as a [[supporting character]] in those featuring [[Spider-Man]].

She dated both [[Flash Thompson]] and [[Harry Osborn]] to make Peter jealous. Gradually, however, a romance developed; Gwen, a science major, appreciated Peter's intellect.

However, [[Mary Jane Watson]]'s unexpected popularity with readers after her debut changed the course of the plan as fans liked Mary Jane more and demanded for her to be Peter Parker's main love interest instead, and that \"no matter how we [i.e. Lee and his artist/co-plotter collaborators] wrote it, Mary Jane always seemed more interesting!\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Fisch|first=Sholly|title=The Wedding of the Year|work=[[Marvel Age]]|issue=54|publisher=[[Marvel Comics]]|date=September 1987|pages=12\u201315}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last= Thomas|first= Roy|date= August 2011|title= Stan Lee's Amazing Marvel Interview!|journal= [[Alter Ego (magazine)|Alter Ego]]|issue= 104| page= 30|publisher= [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]}}</ref>\n\n===Death===\n{{Main|The Night Gwen Stacy Died}}\n[[Gerry Conway]] and [[Roy Thomas]] succeeded Stan Lee as writer and editor, respectively, of ''The Amazing Spider-Man''.

This is still ''technically'' true - if she hadn't fallen from the bridge, the event that caused her death couldn't have happened.

[[Mary Jane Watson]] feels the loss of Gwen deeply and becomes a more mature, compassionate person. Gwen's death also draws Peter and Mary Jane into a closer friendship, and eventually to romance.{{issue|date=December 2012}} Miles Warren, one of Gwen's professors, was secretly in love with her.

Gwen's simple faith in heroes convinces Sheldon of the purpose of the \"Marvels\" (i.e., superheroes)\u2014to protect innocents such as Gwen. He resolves to write a book to praise the heroes and what they should mean to humanity. When the Green Goblin kidnaps Gwen and holds her hostage to bait Spider-Man, Sheldon frantically follows the resulting chase in a taxi and witnesses her death.

This story, published in ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #144 (May 1975), initiated the [[Clone Saga#The original Clone Saga|original Clone Saga]]. At the end of that story, Gwen's clone, a creation of Spider-Man villain the [[Jackal (Marvel Comics)|Jackal]], leaves to find a new life for herself, coming to accept that she is not really the same person who had a relationship with Peter Parker.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #149</ref>\n\nIn the 1988 crossover \"[[The Evolutionary War]]\", the [[High Evolutionary]], who had once been Miles Warren's teacher, captures Gwen's clone. He is dismayed to learn that Miles Warren has perfected the art of cloning and thus lies to the New Men that it was nothing more than a genetic construct created by a virus that he injected into his apprentice, Joyce Delaney.{{issue|date=December 2012}}\n\nDuring the second \"[[Clone Saga]]\", Gwen Stacy's clone, now married to a clone of Professor Warren named Warren Miles, sees a copy of Peter Parker's book of Spider-Man photos, ''Webs'', and remembers (to an extent) her real history. She returns to New York City. During this storyline, she again disappears from Spider-Man's life. It was revealed the Gwen Stacy clone introduced in ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #144 was in fact the second Gwen clone Miles Warren created and has been living in London under the name Joyce Delaney. This clone is murdered by the Gwen Stacy clone known as Abby-L.<ref>''Spider-Island Deadly Foes'' #1</ref>\n\nAnother Gwen clone appears in ''The Amazing Spider-Man'' #399 (March 1995).

She joins the Jackal (alongside [[Carrion (comics)|Carrion]] and a regular Miles Warren clone) in capturing [[Superior Spider-Man]] and [[Kaine Parker|Kaine]].<ref>''Superior Spider-Man Team-Up'' #2</ref> She is sympathetic towards \"Peter\" and Kaine, but at the same time utterly loyal to the Jackal. When the Spiders break free, Superior Spider-Man disarms and attempts to kill her, but is stopped by Kaine. When the Jackal's lab is engulfed in flames, Kaine offers to save her, but she refuses, and is seemingly consumed by the fire.<ref>''Scarlet Spider'' (Vol. 2) #20</ref>\n\n===''Dead No More: The Clone Conspiracy''===\nIn the ''[[Dead No More: The Clone Conspiracy|Clone Conspiracy]]'' storyline, a flashback revealed that Gwen Stacy was conscious during Spider-Man and Green Goblin's battle on the bridge, and as she was falling to her death. She overheard their conversation and discovered Peter is Spider-Man in the process. She was angry at Peter for keeping this secret and for his involvement in her father's death.<ref name=\"clone conspiracy 1\">''The Clone Conspiracy #1''</ref>\n\nIn the present, Gwen is supposedly revived by the [[Ben Reilly|Jackal]] with his clones. The Jackal claims that this one is not a clone but the real Gwen who was harvested and reanimated from her remains and still has all her memories, including those of her death. The Jackal offers Gwen the opportunity to be his business partner as he tries to change the world with his new technology. Gwen is hesitant about this new life at first but accepts it when the Jackal shows that he has reanimated the clone of her father, who is in much better health than he was before he died.<ref name=\"clone conspiracy 1\"/> When Spider-Man arrives at the incorporation and discovers the Jackal's experiments, he is surprised by Gwen's presence and notes that unlike the other people the Jackal revived, who were all clones, Gwen does not trigger his spider sense, making him wonder if she was the real one. He is attacked by the \"reborn\" [[Doctor Octopus]] before he can question the issue further.<ref name=\"clone conspiracy 1\"/>\n\nAfter the Jackal breaks up the fight and shows Spider-Man around the New U, the George Stacy clone recognizes something off about Gwen's face and points his gun at her. It is revealed that the Gwen clone was actually her Earth-65 counterpart [[Spider-Woman (Gwen Stacy)|Spider-Woman]] who assists Spider-Man in escaping. The real Gwen is kidnapped by [[Kaine Parker|Kaine]] and taken to [[Parker Industries]] to be studied. Kaine reveals that he and Spider-Woman came to this Earth to assist Spider-Man because they saw that Spider-Man agreeing with the Jackal's offer on other worlds always results in a global disaster.<ref>''The Clone Conspiracy'' #2</ref> Rhino and Electro are sent to retrieve Gwen after attacking the staff, but Gwen tells them to take Kaine with him too because his condition could help with Jackal's experiments. Anna Maria Marconi also volunteers to come with because she has studied both Kaine and the drug.<ref>''The Clone Conspiracy'' #3</ref>\n\nWhen Spider-Man is taken to Haven, he catches up with Gwen in the household in the facility, where she tries to convince him to support New U Technologies. Peter still has a hard time believing she is the real Gwen given his other experiences with clones. Gwen tries justifying her existence by telling Peter her memories, including how she overheard the Green Goblin talking to Spider-Man before her death. Peter thinks she died hating him, but Gwen said that she did not hate him, but rather died feeling betrayed. Peter again still has doubts towards Gwen not being a clone. She tries kissing him, to no avail which only pushes him to put the mask back on. Gwen witnesses Jackal order the cloned villains to kill Spider-Man and decides to help Peter.<ref>''The Amazing Spider-Man'' vol. 4 #23</ref>\n\nDoctor Octopus pulls a switch that activates the Carrion Virus in all of the revived, including Gwen and George, and causes them to start rapidly decaying.<ref>''The Clone Conspiracy'' #4</ref> After Gwen's father deteriorates in her arms, she assists Spider-Man by helping him get to the lab. When the cloned villains get to the lab doors, Gwen locks Spider-Man inside the lab and sacrifices herself to give him more time.

During an exchange between Peter and Gwen, Eddie Brock attempts to attack Aunt May and retake his symbiote. In a rage, Spider-Man engages Venom on a nearby rooftop. During the fight, Gwen is shown to be able to use her symbiote to fight off Eddie but Eddie reabsorbs his symbiote along with the Carnage symbiote rendering Gwen Stacy an average girl. After a series of tests, it is concluded that this Gwen is not a clone but consciously and genetically is the genuine article now reborn (though Gwen's original body died, the Carnage symbiote absorbed her being and they had bonded since her death). After SHIELD intervenes, SHIELD Director Danvers states Gwen will remain in S.H.I.E.L.D. custody. Peter and May argue for her to come back to live with them, with Tony Stark supporting the Parkers. In ''Ultimate Spider-Man'' #129, the Parkers are now helping to rebuild Gwen's life. Her ghastly experience with the Carnage symbiote also causes her to develop a death anxiety she gradually controls. Six months after the \"Ultimatum\" storyline, in ''Ultimate Comics Spider-Man'' #1, Gwen is living with the Parkers again and seems to be dating Peter. However, circumstances involving the Chameleon made Gwen realize she made a mistake dating Peter.

She is later cured in the climax of the story. In \"The Day Without Spider-Man\", she regains her powers thanks to exposure to a crystal called the Bloodgem and becomes Ghost-Spider during the fight against Scorpion and Tinkerer.\n\n===Film===\n====Sam Raimi series====\n* A student in Peter Parker's university class in ''[[Spider-Man 2]]'', portrayed by [[Brianna Brown]], is identified as Gwen Stacy in the film's novelization.\n* Gwen Stacy is portrayed by [[Bryce Dallas Howard]] in ''[[Spider-Man 3]]''. In this film\u2019s version, she is [[Eddie Brock|Eddie]]\u2019s [[Romantic interest|love interest]] before [[Spider-Man|Peter]], serving as an unintended rival to [[Mary Jane Watson]]. Gwen is a classmate and lab partner of Peter Parker, until Spider-Man rescues her early in the film from a construction crane accident. She kisses an upside-down Spider-Man in similar fashion to how Mary Jane did in ''[[Spider-Man (2002 film)|Spider-Man]]'' which causes Mary Jane to become angry and hurt. As Peter is at the top of [[Lizard (comics)|Dr. Connors]]'s [[quantum mechanics]] class, he tutors her. She considers Peter a [[genius]] and is very fond of him. She is also friends with [[Eddie Brock]] as he took pictures of her so Gwen could be a model. Brock's relationship is short-lived, as Peter, under the influence of the symbiote, steals her from Eddie. He dances with her at the same jazz club where Mary Jane works, but Gwen realizes Peter is doing this to make Mary Jane jealous. Gwen, upset about this, approaches Mary Jane, apologizes, and storms out of the club, leaving Peter behind. She is later present at [[Harry Osborn]]'s funeral.\n* [[Bryce Dallas Howard]] said she would love to be a part of any continuation of the film franchise, while acknowledging her character's opportunity may have passed, especially after ''Spider-Man 3'' ended with Peter and Mary Jane once again in each other\u2019s arms. In May 2007, actor [[James Cromwell]], who played Captain Stacy in the film stated he thought the natural progression for the character would be for both to die early in ''[[Spider-Man 4]]'', mirroring the comics. Howard said a death would not have bothered her. The film was ultimately unmade, although Stacy was in the draft.\n\n====Marc Webb series====\n* [[Emma Stone]] portrays Gwen Stacy in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man (2012 film)|The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' as Peter Parker's love interest. She works as an assistant at Dr. Curt Connors's laboratory at [[Oscorp]], where Peter is bitten by a genetically-engineered spider. She subsequently develops a crush on him, and he soon reveals his secret identity as Spider-Man to her. Gwen plays an important role in the [[Lizard (comics)|Lizard]]'s defeat, by helping Peter develop an antidote for the serum that mutates people into reptilian hybrids through cross-species genetics, using her own scientific background. Her father is killed by the Lizard before Peter can defeat the villain. George begs Peter to keep Gwen out of his dangerous life. Peter honors that vow without telling Gwen immediately; this affronts Gwen until she realizes what her father did, and subsequently forgives Peter. However, when Peter later wonders if he should keep that promise, she just smiles.\n* Emma Stone reprises her role as Gwen Stacy in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man 2]]''. Gwen continues to work at Oscorp, which is owned by [[Harry Osborn]], Peter's best friend. By now, Peter and Gwen have decided to keep their relationship platonic, but Peter's romantic feelings for her are rekindled when she tells him that she is going to [[England]] to study medicine at [[Somerville College, Oxford|Somerville College]], [[Oxford University]]. When Oscorp employee Max Dillon suffers an industrial accident and becomes the villain [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]], Gwen starts asking questions; Donald Menken, a high ranking and mutinous Oscorp board member, decides that she is a threat, fires her and targets her for elimination. When Electro attacks the city's electricity supply, Gwen and Spider-Man work together to stop him. Just then, the Green Goblin kidnaps Gwen and holds her hostage atop of the power plant's clock tower, intent on drawing Spider-Man out. The Green Goblin throws Gwen through the tower's glass rooftop, but Spider-Man saves her by shooting a web for her to grab onto. The web eventually breaks, however, and Gwen falls to the ground far below. Spider-Man catches her with another web an instant too late, as her head hits the concrete floor, killing her instantly. Gwen's death sends Peter into a deep depression, and he decides to give up being Spider-Man. Five months later, he watches a video of Gwen's graduation speech, in which she tells her class that hope is what makes life worth living, even in the darkest of times. Inspired, Peter decides to once again become Spider-Man. As [[viral marketing]] for the film, a [[Tumblr]] page was created for the character.<ref>http://missgwen-stacy.tumblr.com/</ref>\n* In both films, [[Kari Coleman]], Charlie DePew, [[Skyler Gisondo]] and Jacob Rodier portray the Stacy family: Helen Stacy (Gwen's mom), Philip Stacy, Howard Stacy, and Simon Stacy (Gwen's younger brothers) respectively.\n\n===Literature===\n* Although she does not appear directly, Gwen's death plays an important role in ''Revenge of the Sinister Six'' by [[Adam-Troy Castro]], the second part of his ''[[Sinister Six]]'' trilogy, when [[Mysterio]] (posing as [[Electro (Marvel Comics)|Electro]]) takes hostages on the same bridge where Gwen died, using a holographic projection of Gwen's death stuck on a loop to put Spider-Man at a psychological disadvantage. After Spider-Man drives Mysterio away, he takes a moment beside the hologram projector to mourn Gwen's death.\n\n===Video games===\n* Gwen Stacy is briefly mentioned in ''[[Spider-Man: Edge of Time]]''. When a futuristic version of Peter Parker reveals plans to [[Spider-Man 2099]], Alchemex's CEO mentions wanting to save the lives of [[Uncle Ben|Ben Parker]], Gwen, [[George Stacy]] and countless others.\n* Gwen Stacy appears in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man (2012 video game)|The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' video game, voiced by [[Kari Wahlgren]].\n* Gwen Stacy makes her debut as a playable character in ''[[Lego Marvel Super Heroes]]'', voiced again by Kari Wahlgren.\n* Gwen Stacy is playable once again in ''[[Lego Marvel Super Heroes 2]]'' and can switch into her Spider-Gwen persona.\n\n==See also==\n* ''[[The Night Gwen Stacy Died]]''\n* [[Spider-Man supporting characters]]\n* [[Spider-Woman (Gwen Stacy)]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|2}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://marvel.wikia.com/wiki/Gwendolyne_Stacy_(Earth-616) Gwen Stacy in Marvel Comics Database]\n*[http://www.maelmill-insi.de/UHBMCC/ The Unofficial Handbook of Marvel Comics Creators]\n*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuVpwjYgvgg&mode=related&search=/ Physics of Superheroes 1 - Death of Gwen Stacy]\n*[http://www.spiderfan.org/characters/gwen_stacy.html Spiderfan.org &ndash; Gwen Stacy]\n{{Spider-Man characters}}\n{{Spider-Man}}\n{{Symbiote Family and Hosts}}\n{{Ultimate Spider-Man}}\n{{Spectacular Spider-Man (TV series)}}\n{{Stan Lee}}\n{{Goblin (Marvel Comics)}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Stacy, Gwen}}\n[[Category:Characters created by Stan Lee]]\n[[Category:Characters created by Steve Ditko]]\n[[Category:Comics characters introduced in 1965]]\n[[Category:Female characters in comics]]\n[[Category:Female characters in film]]\n[[Category:Fictional characters from New York City]]\n[[Category:Fictional models]]\n[[Category:Fictional victims of kidnapping]]\n[[Category:Fictional murdered people in comics]]\n[[Category:Spider-Man characters]]\n[[Category:Teenage characters in film]]\n\n[[sv:Spider-Man#V\u00e4nner]]\n", "name_user": "Iridescent", "label": "safe", "comment": "Cleanup andtypo fixing,typo(s) fixed: \u2019s \u2192 's (5)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gwen_Stacy"}

He attended Central High, where he reported on the doings of the school, using his father's typewriter to write his stories. Young Earl's mother encouraged him to pursue a career outside of farming. Wilson contributed to the ''Rockford Press'' and the Lima ''Republican'' ''Gazette'', which would be the first to pay him for his writing. He also wrote for the [[Piqua, Ohio]] ''Daily Call'' before enrolling in college in 1925. Wilson attended [[Heidelberg College]] for two years before transferring to [[Ohio State University]] where he worked on the ''Lantern'', the university\u2019s student-run daily newspaper. He also held part-time jobs with the [[The Columbus Dispatch|''Columbus Dispatch'']] and the capital city\u2019s International News Service Bureau. Wilson graduated from [[Ohio State University]] in 1931 with a B. S. in journalism.\n\nIn 1935, Wilson began work for ''[[The Washington Post]]'', meanwhile sending samples of his work to one of the editors at the ''[[New York Post]].'' Later in 1935, Wilson arrived in New York to begin work with the ''Post,'' taking a room in a boarding house on [[Bleecker Street]]. There he met Rosemary Lyons from [[East St. Louis]], IL, a secretary whom he wed in 1936. The couple struggled for several years until Wilson's work at the ''Post'' began to take off.\n\nTheir only child, Earl Wilson, Jr., was born on December 1, 1942. His column, which he took over from a writer who went off to war in 1942, was originally considered \"filler.\" It eventually ran until 1983. As the column grew in popularity and importance, Wilson worked 18-hour days, typically arising in the late morning, telephoning news sources, and taking reports from several assistants. In the evenings he would set out for dinner at [[Toots Shor's]] or a similar theater district restaurant, accompanied by his wife, Rosemary, known to his readers as \"B.W.\" (originally short for Barefoot Wife but when she objected he changed it to Beautiful Wife). The pair made the rounds of night spots until the wee hours of the morning.\n\nBy the early 1950s, the Broadway gossip columns had become an important media outlet; columnists exercised a great deal of power in providing publicity for the celebrities of the day. But, whereas gossip columnists as a group were not held in high regard, Wilson had the reputation of being different: he was a trained journalist who double-checked facts, he was much influenced by his Mid-western upbringing and avoided innuendo and sensationalism, and he sought to cover his stories as real news items. With a reputation for being fair and honest, Wilson was trusted so much that celebrities willingly gave him their stories.\n\nHis chronicling of the [[Broadway theatre]] scene during the \"Golden Age\" of [[show business]] formed the basis for a book published in 1971, ''The Show Business Nobody Knows''.  He signed his columns with the [[Catch phrase|tag line]], \"That's Earl, brother.\"  His nickname was \"Midnight Earl\".  In later years, the name of his column was changed to ''Last Night With Earl Wilson''.  In his final years with the ''Post'', he alternated with the paper's entertainment writer and restaurant critic, Martin Burden, in turning out the column. (Burden, who died in 1993, took over the ''Last Night'' column full-time upon Wilson's retirement.)\n\nWilson is also the author of two books, ''Show Business Laid Bare'',<ref>{{cite book|author=Wilson, Earl|title=Show Business Laid Bare|isbn=978-0-399-11276-8|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/showbusinesslaid00wils}}</ref> and an [[unauthorized biography]] of [[Frank Sinatra]], ''Sinatra: An Unauthorized Biography''.<ref>{{cite book|author=Wilson, Earl|title=Sinatra &ndash; An Unauthorized Biography| isbn= 978-0-451-07487-4}}</ref>  The former book is notable for revealing the extramarital affairs of President [[John F. Kennedy]].\n\nIn the early 1950s, Wilson was an occasional panelist on the NBC [[game show]], ''[[Who Said That?]]'', in which celebrities tried to determine the speaker of quotations taken from recent news reports.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tv.com/who-said-that/show/3295/summary.html|title=Show Overview: ''Who Said That?''|website=tv.com|accessdate=June 12, 2011}}</ref>\n\nOn January 19, 1952, Wilson guest starred on the [[CBS]] live [[variety show]], ''[[Faye Emerson's Wonderful Town]]'', in which hostess [[Faye Emerson]] visited Columbus to accent the kinds of music popular in the Ohio capital city.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://ctva.biz/US/MusicVariety/FayeEmersonsWonderfulTown.htm|title=Faye Emerson's Wonderful Town|publisher=Classic Television Archives|accessdate=February 26, 2012}}</ref>\n\nWilson appeared in a few films as himself, notably ''[[Copacabana (1947 film)|Copacabana]]'' (1947) with [[Groucho Marx]] and [[Carmen Miranda]], ''[[A Face in the Crowd (film)|A Face in the Crowd]]'' (1957) with [[Andy Griffith]], ''[[College Confidential (film)|College Confidential]]'' (1960), and ''[[Beach Blanket Bingo]]'' (1965) with [[Buster Keaton]], [[Paul Lynde]] and [[Don Rickles]]. Wilson also hosted the [[DuMont Television Network|DuMont]] TV show ''[[Stage Entrance]]'' from May 1951 to March 1952.\n\n==Death==\nWilson died in a hospital in [[Yonkers, New York]], in January 1987, after suffering from Parkinson's Disease for several years.\n\nHis was survived by his only child, Earl Wilson, Jr., a songwriter for the [[musical theatre]].

He attended Central High, where he reported on the doings of the school, using his father's typewriter to write his stories. Young Earl's mother encouraged him to pursue a career outside of farming. Wilson contributed to the ''Rockford Press'' and the Lima ''Republican'' ''Gazette'', which would be the first to pay him for his writing. He also wrote for the [[Piqua, Ohio]] ''Daily Call'' before enrolling in college in 1925. Wilson attended [[Heidelberg College]] for two years before transferring to [[Ohio State University]] where he worked on the ''Lantern'', the university\u2019s student-run daily newspaper. He also held part-time jobs with the [[The Columbus Dispatch|''Columbus Dispatch'']] and the capital city\u2019s International News Service Bureau. Wilson graduated from [[Ohio State University]] in 1931 with a B. S. in journalism.\n\nIn 1935, Wilson began work for ''[[The Washington Post]]'', meanwhile sending samples of his work to one of the editors at the ''[[New York Post]].'' Later in 1935, Wilson arrived in New York to begin work with the ''Post,'' taking a room in a boarding house on [[Bleecker Street]]. There he met Rosemary Lyons from [[East St. Louis]], IL, a secretary whom he wed in 1936. The couple struggled for several years until Wilson's work at the ''Post'' began to take off.\n\nTheir only child, Earl Wilson, Jr., was born on December 1, 1942. His column, which he took over from a writer who went off to war in 1942, was originally considered \"filler.\" It eventually ran until 1983. As the column grew in popularity and importance, Wilson worked 18-hour days, typically arising in the late morning, telephoning news sources, and taking reports from several assistants. In the evenings he would set out for dinner at [[Toots Shor's]] or a similar theater district restaurant, accompanied by his wife, Rosemary, known to his readers as \"B.W.\" (for Beautiful Wife). The pair made the rounds of night spots until the wee hours of the morning.\n\nBy the early 1950s, the Broadway gossip columns had become an important media outlet; columnists exercised a great deal of power in providing publicity for the celebrities of the day. But, whereas gossip columnists as a group were not held in high regard, Wilson had the reputation of being different: he was a trained journalist who double-checked facts, he was much influenced by his Mid-western upbringing and avoided innuendo and sensationalism, and he sought to cover his stories as real news items. With a reputation for being fair and honest, Wilson was trusted so much that celebrities willingly gave him their stories.\n\nHis chronicling of the [[Broadway theatre]] scene during the \"Golden Age\" of [[show business]] formed the basis for a book published in 1971, ''The Show Business Nobody Knows''.  He signed his columns with the [[Catch phrase|tag line]], \"That's Earl, brother.\"  His nickname was \"Midnight Earl\".  In later years, the name of his column was changed to ''Last Night With Earl Wilson''.  In his final years with the ''Post'', he alternated with the paper's entertainment writer and restaurant critic, Martin Burden, in turning out the column. (Burden, who died in 1993, took over the ''Last Night'' column full-time upon Wilson's retirement.)\n\nWilson is also the author of two books, ''Show Business Laid Bare'',<ref>{{cite book|author=Wilson, Earl|title=Show Business Laid Bare|isbn=978-0-399-11276-8|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/showbusinesslaid00wils}}</ref> and an [[unauthorized biography]] of [[Frank Sinatra]], ''Sinatra: An Unauthorized Biography''.<ref>{{cite book|author=Wilson, Earl|title=Sinatra &ndash; An Unauthorized Biography| isbn= 978-0-451-07487-4}}</ref>  The former book is notable for revealing the extramarital affairs of President [[John F. Kennedy]].\n\nIn the early 1950s, Wilson was an occasional panelist on the NBC [[game show]], ''[[Who Said That?]]'', in which celebrities tried to determine the speaker of quotations taken from recent news reports.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tv.com/who-said-that/show/3295/summary.html|title=Show Overview: ''Who Said That?''|website=tv.com|accessdate=June 12, 2011}}</ref>\n\nOn January 19, 1952, Wilson guest starred on the [[CBS]] live [[variety show]], ''[[Faye Emerson's Wonderful Town]]'', in which hostess [[Faye Emerson]] visited Columbus to accent the kinds of music popular in the Ohio capital city.<ref>{{cite book|url=http://ctva.biz/US/MusicVariety/FayeEmersonsWonderfulTown.htm|title=Faye Emerson's Wonderful Town|publisher=Classic Television Archives|accessdate=February 26, 2012}}</ref>\n\nWilson appeared in a few films as himself, notably ''[[Copacabana (1947 film)|Copacabana]]'' (1947) with [[Groucho Marx]] and [[Carmen Miranda]], ''[[A Face in the Crowd (film)|A Face in the Crowd]]'' (1957) with [[Andy Griffith]], ''[[College Confidential (film)|College Confidential]]'' (1960), and ''[[Beach Blanket Bingo]]'' (1965) with [[Buster Keaton]], [[Paul Lynde]] and [[Don Rickles]]. Wilson also hosted the [[DuMont Television Network|DuMont]] TV show ''[[Stage Entrance]]'' from May 1951 to March 1952.\n\n==Death==\nWilson died in a hospital in [[Yonkers, New York]], in January 1987, after suffering from Parkinson's Disease for several years.\n\nHis was survived by his only child, Earl Wilson, Jr., a songwriter for the [[musical theatre]]. Wilson Sr.'s wife, Rosemary, predeceased him in February 1986.\n\n==Legacy==\n*[[The Beatles]] dedicated their first set on the ''[[Ed Sullivan Show]]'' to Mr. Wilson.\n*Wilson was portrayed by [[Christian McKay]] in the 2016 film ''[[Florence Foster Jenkins (film)|Florence Foster Jenkins]]''.\n\n==References==\n;Notes\n{{reflist}}\n\n;Bibliography\n*Riley, Sam G.

The series premiered on [[Zee TV]] on 16 August 2010 and ended on 2 June 2011.\n\n==Plot summary==\n{{plot|date=October 2013}}\n''Sanjog Se Bani Sangini'' is the story of Gauri and Rudra &mdash; how they meet each other and fall in love.\n\nGauri ([[Binny Sharma]]) is gentle and modest, yet brave. She handles her household responsibilities, belying the convention that only males are the providers. Her life takes a dramatic turn when one day a young man, Rudra ([[Mohammed Iqbal Khan]]), rams his car into her shop and destroys her means of livelihood. From that moment onwards, Gauri and Rudra's destinies cross. First they are strangers but, eventually, circumstances bring them together as best friends. Gauri is trying to help Rudra marry Pihu ([[Additi Gupta]]), the love of his life. Pihu and Rudra had a fight, and she ended their relationship. Pihu ends up marrying Abhay ([[Raunaq Ahuja]]), a doctor, because of her ego and wish to show Rudra she doesn't need him. Gauri (who has started to fall in love with Rudra) helps him out of depression. Day by day, Rudra is becoming closer to Gauri and Pihu cannot accept that. Abhay is very disturbed because he sees that Pihu hasn't forgotten Rudra.\n\nSoon, Rudra plans to get Gauri married to a boy who loves her. Gauri reluctantly accepts the proposal. Hearing from Abhay that Gauri helped him to marry Pihu, Rudra gets drunk and, in anger, crashes Gauri's marriage. Being out of his senses, Rudra forcibly marries Gauri. As time passes, Rudra finds out that Abhay had lied and accepts Gauri as his wife. But he tells her that he cannot love her for he will always love Pihu. Gauri comes to his house with him.\n\nRudra's mother Raajrani ([[Aruna Irani]]) cannot accept Gauri as his wife, so she calls Pihu and tells her to create differences between Gauri and Rudra. Pihu takes advantage of this as she too cannot stand seeing Rudra with someone else, and makes a plan in which she is to marry Rudra. Rudra's mom later accepts Gauri for she finds out about Pihu's evil intentions. Together, they reveal the truth. Rudra sees Pihu's true colors, and kicks her out of the house.  When Rudra finds out that at first it was his mom's plan to create differences, he and Gauri move out of the house and start living in a working-class neighbourhood. Gradually, Rudra forgets Pihu and he falls in love with Gauri.\n\nPihu loses her mind and becomes crazy for she cannot accept that Rudra hates her. Then Abhay tries to take revenge from Rudra and Gauri by breaking their marriage. He kidnaps Gauri, gets her unconscious and arranges for a man named Ram Mathur ([[Vikas Bhalla]]) to marry her.  \nRam is in love with Gauri, and he did not know she was already married. Rudra fights with Abhay and saves Gauri. Abhay dies.\n\nAfter six months, Ram marries Rudra's sister to get revenge. Rudra and Ram have a fight and Rudra is hit on the head, causing him to lose his memory. Ram goes to jail. Rudra does not remember what happened in the past three years. He doesn't remember meeting Gauri and falling in love with her. He doesn't remember marrying her and that she is carrying his child. He thinks he is still in love with Pihu. The doctor tells everyone that he must not be forced to remember anything. Hence, Rudra's mom wants Gauri to stay away from Rudra. Gauri asks Pihu, who is now a medical student, to act like she still loves Rudra. Pihu tries to refuse but Gauri makes her promise to pretend she is in love with Rudra. Pihu's aunt instigates her to take advantage of the opportunity. Rudra wants to get together with Pihu and schedules their marriage. Pihu, while acting like she loves Rudra, really falls for him again and wants to marry him. Gauri knows Pihu's intentions, but has faith that the Rudra will remember everything before the marriage.\n\nDuring the wedding ceremony, Rudra realizes that Gauri is his wife. But Gauri has already left the house because Rudra's mother told her to leave him alone. Rudra and Gauri get back together and Pihu admits her mistake. She says that there is no first or second love; there is just true love, which is shared by Gauri and Rudra. Gauri becomes a mother to a baby boy, which Pihu helps to deliver. A year later, Pihu announces that Gauri is pregnant again, with a baby girl. While Rudra holds Gauri and says \" who said you only love once?\"\n<!--This summary currently exceeds the recommended maximum length.

Dissatisfied with their [[monaural]] [[Monty Python's Flying Circus (album)|BBC debut album]] released the previous year, the group took full control of the follow-up, which would be the first release of a six-album deal with [[Charisma Records|Charisma]] Records in the UK. Most of the material is from the second [[BBC]] series of ''[[Monty Python's Flying Circus]]'', with a few newly written pieces. One track, \"Stake Your Claim\", is an English-language version of a sketch from the team's first [[Monty Python's Fliegender Zirkus|German episode]].\n\nThe production, with its innovative use of stereo and sound effects, was handled by [[Terry Jones]] and [[Michael Palin]] and proved a technical challenge. According to Jones: \"We had this horrendous time because we were recording in this rather [[hippie|hippy]] recording studio. We were very keen to use the stereo and everything, but what we hadn't realised was that the guy who was doing the recording, who I think was out of his head most of the time, had not been making any notes. We'd end up with tapes and tapes of material with no idea of where anything was on the tapes. That was a bitter experience.\"<ref>''[[The Pythons Autobiography by The Pythons]]'', p179, 2003, Orion</ref>\n\nThe sleeve was designed by [[Terry Gilliam]], from an idea by Terry Jones.<ref>''[[Monty Python: Almost the Truth (Lawyers Cut)]]'', episode 3, 2009</ref> Packaged as a classical music recording (\"Beethoven -  Symphony No. 2 In D Major\"), the cover was defaced by the Pythons to serve as their own record jacket. (The \"serious\" liner notes on the back also bear a Pythonesque stamp: the biography of [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] quickly turns into a commentary on Beethoven's [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]] tennis debut.) Included with the original vinyl LP were three card inserts printed with detailed instructions, scripts and cut-out props for the \"Be A Great Actor\" sketch on side 2.\n\nDue to the limitations of the vinyl format, the original 1971 UK release had many sketches edited down while others, such as \"[[World Forum/Communist Quiz|Communist Quiz]]\" and \"Penguin On The TV\", were omitted altogether causing a re-sequencing of the \"Royal Festival Hall Concert\" and \"Spam\" sketches. This truncated version was used for all UK cassette releases until 1994. When the album was released in the US in 1972 to coincide with the US release of ''[[And Now For Something Completely Different]]'', the full unedited version was used. This longer edit was used for all CD releases in both the UK and US.\n\nAs well as featuring a pared down track list, the original UK vinyl enjoyed two subtly different releases. Initial pressings were issued on the pink \"famous Charisma label\" (erroneously listing the release year as 1970) with subsequent pressings replacing this with the \"Mad Hatter\" label design (correcting the year to 1971). Both editions featured a trick continuous runout groove at the end of Side 1 where the sound of a record scratch is followed by Michael Palin's exclamation of \"Sorry squire! I scratched the record\" repeated ad infinitum, at least until the listener chooses to lift the stylus off the vinyl.\n\nThe album marked the group's first chart success, reaching No.26 in the UK album chart.<ref>http://www.officialcharts.com/search/albums/another%20monty%20python%20record/</ref>\n\nA 7\" single, the Pythons' first, combining [[Spam Song]]/The Concert (CB.192) was issued in the UK on 8 September 1972, almost a year after the album's release.

The Thai poetical tradition was originally based on indigenous poetical forms such as [[Thai poetry#Rai|''rai'']] (\u0e23\u0e48\u0e32\u0e22), [[Thai poetry#Khlong|''khlong'']] (\u0e42\u0e04\u0e25\u0e07), [[Thai poetry#Kap|''kap'']] (\u0e01\u0e32\u0e1e\u0e22\u0e4c), and [[Thai poetry#Klon|''klon'']] (\u0e01\u0e25\u0e2d\u0e19). Some of these poetical forms\u2014notably ''Khlong'' - have been shared between the speakers of tai languages since ancient time (before the emergence of Siam). An early representative work of ''Khlong'' poetry is the epic poem ''Thao Hung Thao Cheuang'', a shared epic story, about a noble warrior of a Khom race, of the tai-speaking people in mainland Southeast Asia.<ref name=Chamberlain-1989>{{cite journal|last=Chamberlain|first=James|title=Thao Hung or Cheuang: A Tai Epic Poem|journal=Mon-Khmer Studies|number=18\u201319|pages=14\u201334|year=1989|url=http://sealang.net/sala/archives/pdf8/chamberlain1989-1990thao.pdf}}</ref>\n\n===<span id=\"Epic Poem of ''Thao Hung or Thao Cheuang\"></span><span id=\"Thao Hung Thao Chueang\"></span><span id=\"Thao Hung or Thao Chueang\"></span><span id=\"Thao Hung or Chueang\"></span><span id=\"Thao Hung Rue Chueang\"></span>Epic poem of ''Thao Hung or Thao Chueang''===\nThe greatest literary work to appear in any tai-languages before the branching off of tai-speaking people into separate nations is the Epic Poem of ''Thao Hung or Cheuang'' ({{lang-th|\u0e17\u0e49\u0e32\u0e27\u0e2e\u0e38\u0e48\u0e07\u0e17\u0e49\u0e32\u0e27\u0e40\u0e08\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e07}}).

However, subsequent research found that ''Thao Cheuang'' does not belong to any particular tai ethnic group but represents, in James Chamberlain's words, \"a time in Southeast Asia concerning which little is known, a time long before current political boundaries were drawn, a time of great ethnic and political rivalry among would-be nations and people.\"<ref name=\"Chamberlain-1989\" />{{RP|21}}\n\n===Indian influence on the Siamese language===\n{{see also | Indosphere | Sanskritisation }}\n\n[[File:Indian_cultural_zone.svg|thumb|300px|right|Historic [[Indosphere]] cultural influence zone of [[Greater India]] for transmission of elements of Indian culture including language, arts, literature and drama.]]\n[[file:Siamese theater group around 1900.jpg|right|250px|thumb|A Siamese ''Khon'' dramatic troupe with accompanying \"Mahoree\" instrumental band]]\n\nThrough [[Silk Road transmission of Buddhism|Buddhism]]'s and [[Hinduism in Southeast Asia|Hindu]]'s influence, a variety of ''[[Chanda]]'' prosodic meters were received via [[Ceylon]].

This literary influence changed the course of the Thai or Siamese language\u2014setting it apart from other ''tai'' languages\u2014by increasing the number of Sanskrit and Pali words and imposing the demand on the Thai to develop a writing system that preserved the orthography of Sanskrit words for literary purposes. By the 15th century, the Thai language had evolved into a distinctive medium along with a nascent literary identity of a new nation. It allowed Siamese poets to compose in different poetical styles and mood\u2014from playful and humorous rhymed verses, to romantic and elegant ''khlong'' and to polished and imperious ''chan'' prosodies which were modified from classical Sanskrit meters. Thai poets experimented with these different prosodic forms, producing innovative \"hybrid\" poems such as ''Lilit'' ({{lang-th|\u0e25\u0e34\u0e25\u0e34\u0e15}}\u2014an interleave of [[Thai poetry#Khlong|''khlong'']] and [[Thai poetry#Kap|''kap'']] or [[Thai poetry#Rai|''rai'']] verses), or ''Kap hor Klong'' ({{lang-th|\u0e01\u0e32\u0e1e\u0e22\u0e4c\u0e2b\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e42\u0e04\u0e25\u0e07}} - a series of [[Thai poetry#Khlong|''khlong'']] poems each of which is enveloped by [[Thai poetry#Kap|''kap'']] verses). The Thai thus developed a keen mind and a keen ear for poetry. To maximize this new literary medium, however, a rather intensive classical education in Pali and Sanskrit was required. This made \"serious poetry\" an occupation of the noble classes. However, B.J. Terwiel notes, citing a 17th-century Thai text book ''Jindamanee'', that scribes and common Siamese men, too, were encouraged to learn basic Pali and Sanskrit terms for career advancement.<ref name=\"Terwiel-1996\" />{{RP|322-323}} Thai poetry and literary production came to dominate the learned literature of the tai-speaking world from the mid-Ayutthaya period until the 20th century.

[[Thailand]]'s [[national epic]] is a version of the [[Ramayana]] called the ''[[Ramakien]]'', translated from Sanskrit and rearranged into Siamese verses. The importance of the Ramayana epic in Thailand is due to the Thai's adoption of the Hindu religio-political ideology of kingship, as embodied by the Lord Rama. The former Siamese capital, Ayutthaya, was named after the holy city of [[Ayodhya]], the city of Lord Rama. All Thai kings have been referred to as \"Rama\" to the present day.\n\nThe mythical tales and epic cycle of ''Ramakien'' provide the Siamese with a rich and perennial source for dramatic materials. The royal court of Ayutthaya developed classical dramatic forms of expression called ''[[khon]]'' and ''[[Lakhon nok|lakhon]]''. ''Ramakien'' played a great role in shaping these dramatic arts. During the Ayutthaya period, ''khon'', or a dramatized version of Ramakien, was classified as ''[[lakhon nai]]'' or a theatrical performance reserved for aristocratic audiences. A French diplomat, Simon de La Loub\u00e8re, witnessed and documented it in 1687, during a formal diplomatic mission sent by King [[Louis XIV]].<ref>{{cite book|first=Simon|last=La Loub\u00e8re|title=A new historical relation of the kingdom of Siam|publisher=London: Printed by F.L. for Tho.

The ''Trai Phum Phra Ruang'' explains the composition of the universe, which, according to the Theravada Buddhist Thai, consists of three different \"worlds\" or levels of existence and their respective mythological inhabitants and creatures. The year of composition was dated at 1345 CE, whereas the authorship is traditionally attributed to the then designated heir to the throne and later King [[Mahathammaracha I|LiThai]] ({{lang-th|\u0e1e\u0e0d\u0e32\u0e25\u0e34\u0e44\u0e17\u0e22}}) of Sukhothai. ''Traibhumikatha'' is a work of high scholarly standard. In composing it, King Lithai had to consult over 30 Buddhist treatises, including [[Tripitaka]] ({{lang-th|\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e30\u0e44\u0e15\u0e23\u0e1b\u0e34\u0e0e\u0e01}}) and [[Milinda Panha]].

The first Lilit poem to appear is ''[[Lilit Yuan Phai]]'' ({{lang-th|\u0e25\u0e34\u0e25\u0e34\u0e15\u0e22\u0e27\u0e19\u0e1e\u0e48\u0e32\u0e22}} 'the defeat of the Yuan', composed during the early-Ayutthaya period (c. 1475 CE). ''Yuan Phai'' is the Thai equivalent of the Song of Roland. It is an epic war poem of about 1180 lines, narrating the key events of the war between King Borommatrailokkanat (1448\u20131488) and King [[Tilokaraj]] of [[Lan Na]], and providing a [[victory ode]] for the King of Siam. The importance of ''Yuan Phai'' is not limited to just being the oldest surviving example of Lilit poetry. It serves also as an important historical account of the war between Siam and Lan Na, as well as an evidence of the Siamese's [[Yuan Phai#Theory of kingship|theory of kingship]] that was evolving during the reign of Borommatrailokkanat.\n\nAnother famous piece of lilit poetry is ''[[Lilit Phra Lo]]'' ({{lang-th|\u0e25\u0e34\u0e25\u0e34\u0e15\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e30\u0e25\u0e2d}}) (c. 1500), a tragico-romantic epic poem that employed a variety of poetical forms. ''Phra Lo'' is roughly 2,600 lines in length. It is one of the major ''lilit'' compositions still surviving today and is considered to be the best among them. ''Phra Lo'' is considered to be one of the earliest Thai poems that evoke sadness and tragic emotions. The story ends with the tragic death of the eponymic hero and two beautiful princesses with whom he was in love. The erotic theme of the poem also made ''Phra Lo'' controversial among the Siamese noble classes for generations. While its author is unknown, ''Phra Lo'' is believed to have been written around the beginning of King Ramathibodi II's reign (1491-1529), and certainly not later than 1656, since a part of it was recited in a Thai textbook composed in the [[King Narai]]'s reign. The plot probably came from a folk tale in the north of Thailand. Its tragic story has universal appeal and its composition is considered to be a high achievement under the Thai poetic tradition.{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\n===<span id=\"Mahachat Kham Luang\"></span><span id=\"Maha Chat Kham Luang\"></span><span id=\"Mahachat Khamluang\"></span><span id=\"Mahajati Kham Luang\"></span>Maha-chat Kham Luang: the \"Great Birth\" sermon===\nThe third major work of this period is ''[[Mahajati Kham Luang]]'' or ''Mahachat Kham Luang'' ({{lang-th|\u0e21\u0e2b\u0e32\u0e0a\u0e32\u0e15\u0e34\u0e04\u0e33\u0e2b\u0e25\u0e27\u0e07}}), the Thai epic account of the \"Great Birth\" (maha-jati) of [[Vessantara]] [[Bodhisatta]], the last final life before he became the Buddha.

In 1492, King Borommatrailokkanat authorized a group of scholars to write a poem based on the story of [[Vessantara Jataka]], believed to be the greatest of Buddha's incarnations. Their joint effort was this great work and the precedence of reciting Maha, the Great Life, was then established. ''Mahachat'' has traditionally been divided into 13 books. Six of them were lost during the sack of Ayutthaya and were ordered to be recomposed in 1815. There are many versions of ''Mahachat'' in Thailand today.\n\n===<span id=\"Nirat\"></span> Nirat: The Siamese tradition of parting and longing poetry===\nThe ''nirat'' ({{lang-th|\u0e19\u0e34\u0e23\u0e32\u0e28}}) is a lyrical genre, popular in Thai literature, which can be translated as 'farewell poetry'. The core of the poetry is a travel description, but essential is the longing for the absent lover. The poet describes his journey through landscapes, towns, and villages, but he regularly interrupts his description to express his feelings for and thoughts of the abandoned lover. Nirat poetry probably originated from the Northern Thai people. ''Nirat [[Hariphunchai]]'' (1637) is traditionally believed to be the first Nirat to appear in the Thai language, during the reign of King [[Prasat Thong]]. However, the Thai ''nirat'' tradition could prove to be much older, depending on whether ''Khlong Thawatossamat'' could be dated back to the reign of King [[Borommatrailokkanat]] (1431-1488). Siamese poets composed Nirat with different poetical device. During the Ayutthaya period, poets liked to compose Nirat poems using ''[[Thai poetry#Khlong|''khlong'']]'' (\u0e42\u0e04\u0e25\u0e07) and ''[[Thai poetry#Kap|''kap'']]'' (\u0e01\u0e32\u0e1e\u0e22\u0e4c) metrical variety.

Since nirat poems record what the poet sees or experiences during his journey, they represent an information source for the Siamese culture as well as history in the premodern time. This poetical genre later spread, first to Myanmar in the late 18th Century, and then Cambodia in the mid 19th century, at the time when Cambodia was heavily influenced by the Siamese culture.<ref>{{cite journal|first=Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric|last= Maurel|title=A Khmer \"nirat\", 'Travel in France during the Paris World Exhibition of 1900': influences from the Thai?|jstor=23749987|journal= South East Asia Research|volume=10|number=1|year=2002|pages=99\u2013112|doi= 10.5367/000000002101297026}}</ref> Famous poems in the ''nirat'' genre during the Ayutthaya period are:\n* ''Khlong Thawatossam\u0101t'' (c. 1450?)

The large number of Sanskrit words in ''Thawatossamat'' suggests that it was composed perhaps in the reign of King [[Borommatrailokkanat]] (1431-1488) when such literary style was common. ''Thawatossamat'' is also an important work of Thai literature because it records the knowledge about specific traditions and norms practiced by Thai people in each month of a year. ''Thawatossamat'' is also unique among the ''nirat'' genre of poetry because the poet(s) do not travel anywhere but they nonetheless express the longing and sadness that each month of separation from their loved ones brings.  \n* ''Khlong Kamsuan S\u012bpr\u0101t'' ({{lang-th|\u0e42\u0e04\u0e25\u0e07\u0e01\u0e33\u0e2a\u0e23\u0e27\u0e25\u0e28\u0e23\u0e35\u0e1b\u0e23\u0e32\u0e0a\u0e0d\u0e4c}}; \"the mournful song of S\u012bpr\u0101t\") by S\u012bpr\u0101t: A nirat poem composed in ''khlong d\u00e0n'' ({{lang-th|\u0e42\u0e04\u0e25\u0e07\u0e14\u0e31\u0e49\u0e19}}) meter.\n* ''Kap Hor Khlong Nirat Thans\u014dk'' ({{lang-th|\u0e01\u0e32\u0e1e\u0e22\u0e4c\u0e2b\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e42\u0e04\u0e25\u0e07\u0e19\u0e34\u0e23\u0e32\u0e28\u0e18\u0e32\u0e23\u0e42\u0e28\u0e01}}; \"a nirat at Thans\u014dk stream in kap-hor-khlong verse\") (c. 1745) by Prince Thammathibet: a nirat poem composed in a special style of ''kap hor khlong'' - where each of the ''khlong'' poems is enclosed in ''kap'' verses. This is a rare example of a highly polished and stately style of Thai poetry. ''Nirat Thans\u014dk'' is 152-stanza long (1,022 lines).\n* ''Kap Hor Khlong Praphat Than-Thongdang'' ({{lang-th|\u0e01\u0e32\u0e1e\u0e22\u0e4c\u0e2b\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e42\u0e04\u0e25\u0e07\u0e1b\u0e23\u0e30\u0e1e\u0e32\u0e2a\u0e18\u0e32\u0e23\u0e17\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e41\u0e14\u0e07}}; \"a royal visit at Than-Thongdang stream in kap-hor-khlong verse\") (c. 1745) by Prince Thammathibet.

The other half seems to have been lost.\n\n===The Siamese epic ''Khun Chang Khun Phaen''===\n[[Image:SephaPerformance.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Modern performance of ''sepha'' oral recitation of Thai poetry.]]\n\nIn the Ayutthaya period, folktales also flourished. One of the most famous folktales is the story of ''[[Khun Chang Khun Phaen]]'' ({{lang-th|\u0e02\u0e38\u0e19\u0e0a\u0e49\u0e32\u0e07\u0e02\u0e38\u0e19\u0e41\u0e1c\u0e19}}), referred to in Thailand simply as \"''Khun Phaen''\", which combines the elements of romantic comedy and heroic adventures, ending in the tragic death of one of the main protagonists. The epic of ''Khun Chang Khun Phaen'' (KCKP) revolves around ''Khun Phaen'', a Siamese general with super-human magical power who served the King of Ayutthaya, and his love-triangle relationship between himself, Khun Chang, and a beautiful Siamese girl named Wan-Thong. The composition of KCKP, much like other [[oral tradition|orally-transmitted]] epics, evolved over time. It originated as a recreational recitation or ''[[sepha]]'' within the Thai oral tradition from around the beginning of the 17th century (c.1600). Siamese [[troubadour]]s and [[minstrel]]s added more subplots and embellished scenes to the original storyline as time went on.<ref name=Baker-2009>{{cite journal|last1=Baker|first1=Chris|last2=Phongpaichit|first2=Pasuk|title=The Career of Khun Chang Khun Phaen|journal=Journal of the Siam Society|volume=97|year=2009|pages=1\u201342|url=http://www.siam-society.org/pub_JSS/jss097BakerPasuk.pdf}}</ref> By the late period of the Ayutthaya Kingdom, it had attained the current shape as a long work of [[epic poem]] with the length of about 20,000 lines, spanning 43 ''[[samut khoi|samut thai]]'' books. The version that exists today was composed with ''klon'' meter throughout and is referred to in Thailand as ''nithan Kham Klon'' ({{lang-th|\u0e19\u0e34\u0e17\u0e32\u0e19\u0e04\u0e33\u0e01\u0e25\u0e2d\u0e19}}) meaning a ''poetic tale''. A standard edition of KCKP, as published by the National Library, is 1085-page long.\n[[file:KCKP_samut_thai_mss_2.jpg|thumb|right|295px|Samut Thai mss of ''Khun Chang Phun Phaen''; the text recounts the scene where Khun Phaen rescues Wanthong from arrest]]\n\nAs the national epic of the Siamese people, ''Khun Chang Khun Phaen'' is unique among other major epic poems of the world in that it concerns the struggles, romance, and martial exploits of non-aristocratic protagonists - with a high degree of [[Khun Chang Khun Phaen#Realism|realism]] - rather than being chiefly about the affairs of great kings, noble men or deities.<ref name=\"Baker-2009\" />{{RP|1}} The realism of KCKP also makes it standout from other epic literature of the region. As Baker and Phongpaichit note, the depiction of war between Ayutthaya and Chiangmai in ''Khun Chang Khun Phaen'' is \"[p]ossibly ... the most realistic depiction of pre-modern warfare in the region, portraying the adventure, the risk, the horror, and the gain.\"<ref name=\"Baker-2009\" />{{RP|14}} KCKP additionally contains rich and detailed accounts of the traditional Thai society during the late Ayutthaya period, including religious practices, superstitious beliefs, social relations, household management, military tactics, court and legal procedures etc. To this day, KCKP is regarded as the masterpiece of Thai literature for its high entertainment value - with engaging plots even by modern standard - and its wealth of cultural knowledge. Marveling at the sumptuous milieu of old Siamese customs, beliefs, and practices in which the story takes place, [[William J. Gedney]], a philologist specialized in Southeast Asian languages, commented that: \u201cI have often thought that if all other information on traditional Thai culture were to be lost, the whole complex could be reconstructed from this marvelous text.\u201d A complete English prose translation of KCKP was published by Chris Baker and P.

He simply uses his trickeries, jests and pranks to upend lives and affairs of others which sometimes results in tragic outcomes. The story of Sri Thanonchai is well known among both Thai and Lao people. In the Lao tradition, Sri Thanonchai is called ''Xiang Mieng''. A Lao-Isaan version of ''Xiang Mieng'' describes Sri Thanonchai as an Ayutthayan trickster.<ref>{{cite web|title=Sepha Sri Thanonchai Xiang Mieng|website=Vajirayana.org|url=http://vajirayana.org/%E0%B9%80%E0%B8%AA%E0%B8%A0%E0%B8%B2-%E0%B9%80%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%B7%E0%B9%88%E0%B8%AD%E0%B8%87%E0%B8%A8%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%B5%E0%B8%98%E0%B8%99%E0%B8%8D%E0%B9%84%E0%B8%8A%E0%B8%A2%E0%B9%80%E0%B8%8A%E0%B8%B5%E0%B8%A2%E0%B8%87%E0%B9%80%E0%B8%A1%E0%B8%B5%E0%B9%88%E0%B8%A2%E0%B8%87/%E0%B8%84%E0%B8%B3%E0%B8%99%E0%B8%B3}}</ref>\n\n===The Legend of Phra Malai (1737)===\n[[File:Phra_Malai.png|thumb|270px|right|Phra Malai's journey as depicted in an illustrated Thai manuscript written in [[Khmer language|Khmer]] script (Khom) dated to the mid-nineteenth century.]]\nThe Legend of [[Phra Malai]] ({{lang-th|\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e30\u0e21\u0e32\u0e25\u0e31\u0e22\u0e04\u0e33\u0e2b\u0e25\u0e27\u0e07}}) is a religious epic adventure composed by Prince [[Thammathibet]], one of the greatest Ayutthayan poets, in 1737, although the story's origin is assumed to be much older, being based on a Pali text. Phra Malai figures prominently in Thai art, religious treatises, and rituals associated with the afterlife, and the story is one of the most popular subjects of 19th-century illustrated Thai manuscripts.\n\nPrince Thammathibet's ''Phra Malai'' is composed in a style that alternates between ''rai'' and ''khlong sii-suphap.'' It tells a story of Phra Malai, a Buddhist monk of the Theravada tradition said to have attained supernatural powers through his accumulated merit and meditation. Phra Malai makes a journey into the realm of hell (naraka) to teach Buddhism to the underworld creatures and the deceased.<ref>{{cite web|title=A Thai book of merit: Phra Malai's journeys to heaven and hell|website=Asian and African studies blog|url=https://blogs.bl.uk/asian-and-african/2013/09/a-thai-book-of-merit-phra-malais-journeys-to-heaven-and-hell.html}}</ref> Phra Malai then returns to the world of the living and tells people the story of the underworld, reminding listeners to make good merits and to adhere to the buddhist's teachings in order to avoid damnation. While in the human realm, Phra Malai receives an offering of eight lotus flowers from a poor woodcutter, which he eventually offers at the Chulamani Chedi, a heavenly stupa believed to contain a relic of the Buddha. In Tavatimsa heaven, Phra Malai converses with the god Indra and the Buddha-to-come, Metteyya, who reveals to the monk insights about the future of mankind. Through recitations of Phra Malai the karmic effects of human actions were taught to the faithful at funerals and other merit-making occasions. Following Buddhist precepts, obtaining merit, and attending performances of the Vessantara Jataka all counted as virtues that increased the chances of a favourable rebirth, or Nirvana in the end.\n\n===Other notable works from the Ayutthaya Period===\nThree most famous poets of the Ayutthaya Period were [[S\u012bpr\u0101t]] (1653-1688) ({{lang-th|\u0e28\u0e23\u0e35\u0e1b\u0e23\u0e32\u0e0a\u0e0d\u0e4c}}), [[Phra Maha Raja-Kru]] ({{lang-th|\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e30\u0e21\u0e2b\u0e32\u0e23\u0e32\u0e0a\u0e04\u0e23\u0e39}}), and Prince [[Thammathibet]] (1715-1755) ({{lang-th|\u0e40\u0e08\u0e49\u0e32\u0e1f\u0e49\u0e32\u0e18\u0e23\u0e23\u0e21\u0e18\u0e34\u0e40\u0e1a\u0e28\u0e44\u0e0a\u0e22\u0e40\u0e0a\u0e29\u0e10\u0e4c\u0e2a\u0e38\u0e23\u0e34\u0e22\u0e27\u0e07\u0e28\u0e4c}}). Sriprat composed ''Anirut Kham Chan'' (\"the tale of Prince [[Anirudha]] in [[Thai poetry#Chan|''kham chan'']] poetry\") which is considered to be one of the best [[Thai poetry#Chan|''kham chan'']] composition in the Thai language. Prince Thammathibet composed many extant refined poems, including romantic \"parting and longing\" poems. He also composed [[Royal Barge Procession]] songs or ''kap h\u00e9 reu'' ({{lang-th|\u0e01\u0e32\u0e1e\u0e22\u0e4c\u0e40\u0e2b\u0e48\u0e40\u0e23\u0e37\u0e2d}}) to be used during the King's grand seasonal water-way procession which is a unique tradition of the Siamese. His barge-procession songs are still considered best in the Thai repertoire of royal procession poems. Other notable literary works of the mid and late Ayutthaya Kingdom include:\n[[File:Bathing Ceremony of Vajirunhit.jpg|right|thumb|300px|The royal barge procession on 14 January 1886 before the Royal Ratchaworadit Pier]]\n\n* ''Sue-ko Kham Chan'' ({{lang-th|\u0e40\u0e2a\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e42\u0e04\u0e04\u0e33\u0e09\u0e31\u0e19\u0e17\u0e4c}}) (c. 1657) by Phra Maha Raja-Kru ({{lang-th|\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e30\u0e21\u0e2b\u0e32\u0e23\u0e32\u0e0a\u0e04\u0e23\u0e39}}). Sue-ko Kham Chan is the earliest-known surviving ''kham chan'' ({{lang-th|\u0e04\u0e33\u0e09\u0e31\u0e19\u0e17\u0e4c}}) poem to appear in the Thai language. It is based on a story from [[Pa\u00f1\u00f1\u0101sa J\u0101taka]] ({{lang-th|\u0e1b\u0e31\u0e0d\u0e0d\u0e32\u0e2a\u0e0a\u0e32\u0e14\u0e01}}) or Apocryphal Birth-Stories of the Buddha. ''Sue-ko Kham Chan'' narrates a story concerning a virtuous brotherly-like friendship between a calf and a tiger cub. Their love for each other impresses a [[rishi]] who asks the gods to turn them into humans on the merits of their virtues. ''Sue-ko Kham Chan'' teaches an important concept of Buddhist teaching according to which one becomes a human being, the highest species of the animal, not because he was born such, but because of his virtue or ''sila-dhamma'' ({{lang-th|\u0e28\u0e35\u0e25\u0e18\u0e23\u0e23\u0e21}}).     \n* ''Samutta-K\u014dt Kham Chan'' ({{lang-th|\u0e2a\u0e21\u0e38\u0e17\u0e23\u0e42\u0e06\u0e29\u0e04\u0e33\u0e09\u0e31\u0e19\u0e17\u0e4c}}) (c. 1657) by Phra Maha Raja-Kru. ''Samutta-K\u014dt kham chan'' is a religious-themed epic poem based on a story of [[Pa\u00f1\u00f1\u0101sa-J\u0101taka|Pannasa-Jataka]]. The poem is 2,218-stanza long (around 8,800 lines). However, the original poet, Phra Maha Raja-Kru, only composed 1,252 stanzas and did not finish it. King [[Narai]] (1633-1688) further composed 205 stanza during his reign and [[Paramanuchitchinorot|Paramanuchit-Chinorot]], a noble-born poet monk and the [[Supreme Patriarch of Thailand]], finished it in 1849. Samut-Koat Kham Chan was praised by the Literature Society as one of the best ''kham chan'' poems in the Thai language.\n* ''Jindamanee'' ({{lang-th|\u0e08\u0e34\u0e19\u0e14\u0e32\u0e21\u0e13\u0e35}}; \"Gems of the Mind\"): the first Thai grammar book and considered to be the most important book for teaching Thai language until the early 20th century. The first part was probably written during the reign of King [[Ekathotsarot]] ({{lang-th|\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e30\u0e40\u0e08\u0e49\u0e32\u0e40\u0e2d\u0e01\u0e32\u0e17\u0e28\u0e23\u0e16}}) (1605-1620).<ref>{{cite web|title=Jindamanee|website=Thairat|url=http://www.thairath.co.th/content/841344|language=Thai}}</ref> The later part was composed by Phra Horathibodi, a royal scholar, in the reign of King [[Narai]] (1633-1688). ''Jindamanee'' instructs not only the grammar and the orthography of Thai language, but also the art of poetry. ''Jindamanee'' contains many valuable samples of Thai poems from works which are now lost. For a 400-year-old Asian grammar book, ''Jindamanee'' 's didactic model is based on sound linguistic principles. Scholars believe that European knowledge on grammar, especially via French missionaries stationed in Siam during the 17th century, may have influenced its composition. \n[[File:Yak-female-Bangkok1210.JPG|thumb|right|260px|Statue of a ''[[yaksha|yak\u1e63\u012b]]'', one of the main characters of ''[[The Twelve Sisters|Phra Rot Meri]]'']]\n* ''[[Nang Sib Song]]'' ({{lang-th|\u0e19\u0e32\u0e07\u0e2a\u0e34\u0e1a\u0e2a\u0e2d\u0e07}}; \"the twelve princesses\")  or ''Phra Rotthasen'' ({{lang-th|\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e30\u0e23\u0e16\u0e40\u0e2a\u0e19}}) or ''Phra Rot Meri'' ({{lang-th|\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e30\u0e23\u0e16\u0e40\u0e21\u0e23\u0e35}}): an indigenous folk tale, based on a previous life of the Buddha, popularized in many Southeast Asian countries. There are several poetic retellings of this story in the Thai language. The story of ''Nang Sib Song'' concerns the life of twelve sisters abandoned by their parents and adopted by an Ogress ''Santhumala'' disguised as a beautiful lady. The conclusion is the sad love story about the only surviving son of the twelve sisters, ''Phra Rotthasen'' (\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e30\u0e23\u0e16\u0e40\u0e2a\u0e19) with ''Meri'' (\u0e40\u0e21\u0e23\u0e35) the adopted daughter of ogress Santhumala. This is a story of unrequited love that ends with the death of the lovers, Rotthsen and Meri.       \n* ''[[Dance of Thailand|Lakhon]]'' ({{lang-th|\u0e25\u0e30\u0e04\u0e23}}): ''Lakhon'' is a highly regarded type dramatic performance and literature in Siam. It is divided into two categories: ''lakhon nai'' ({{lang-th|\u0e25\u0e30\u0e04\u0e23\u0e43\u0e19}}), dramatic plays reserved only for the aristocrats, and ''lakhon n\u014dk'' ({{lang-th|\u0e25\u0e30\u0e04\u0e23\u0e19\u0e2d\u0e01}}), plays for the enjoyment of the commoners. Only three plays have traditionally been classified as ''[[lakhon nai]]'': ''[[Ramakien]]'', ''[[Aniruddha|Anirut]]'', and ''[[Panji (prince)|Inao]]''. Fifteen plays survived the destruction of Ayutthaya. Among the most well-known are: \n** ''S\u0101ng-thong'' ({{lang-th|\u0e2a\u0e31\u0e07\u0e02\u0e4c\u0e17\u0e2d\u0e07}}) - a play based on a Buddhist ''[[jataka]]'' story of a noble man who hides his identity by disguising as a black-skinned savage. Its popularity was revived during the early Rattanakosin era by King [[Rama II of Siam|Rama II]] who rewrote many parts of it as ''lakorn nok''.\n** ''[[Panji (prince)|Inao]]'' ({{lang-th|\u0e2d\u0e34\u0e40\u0e2b\u0e19\u0e32}}) - one of the three major ''[[lakhon nai]]s''. Inao was a very popular drama among the Siamese aristocrats of the late-Ayutthaya period. It is based on the East-Javanese legend of Prince [[Panji (prince)|Panji]]. Inao continued to be popular in the early-Rattanakosin era during which there are many adaptations of Inao in Thai language. The sack of Ayutthaya spread its popularity to Burma.\n** ''Phikul Thong'' ({{lang-th|\u0e1e\u0e34\u0e01\u0e38\u0e25\u0e17\u0e2d\u0e07}}) or ''Ph\u00f3m H\u00f3m'' ({{lang-th|\u0e19\u0e32\u0e07\u0e1c\u0e21\u0e2b\u0e2d\u0e21}}):\n\n==Early Rattanakosin Period==\nWith the arrival of the [[Rattanakosin era]], Thai literature experienced a rebirth of creative energy and reached its most prolific period. The Rattanakosin era is characterized by the imminent pressure to return to the literary perfection and to recover important literary works lost during the war between Ayutthaya and the [[Konbaung Dynasty|Konbuang Empire]]. A considerable poetic and creative energy of this period was spent to revive or repair the national treasures which had been lost or damaged following the fall of the old Capital. Epics, notably ''[[Ramakien]]'' and ''[[Khun Chang Khun Phaen]]'', were recomposed or collected - with aid of surviving poets and troubadours who had committed them to memory (not rare in the 18th Century) - and written down for preservation. Nevertheless, many court singers and poets were carried away or killed by the invading Burmese army and some works were lost forever. But it goes to show how rich the Siamese literary creations, especially poetical works, must have been before the war, since so much still survived even after the destruction of their former Kingdom. \n[[File:104 Ramakien Murals (9148225737).jpg|thumb|left|300px|Mural of the [[Ramakien|Ramakien Epic]], revised by King Rama I, on the walls of [[Wat Phra Kaew]], Bangkok]]\n\nThe royal poets of the early Rattanakosin did not merely recompose the damaged or lost works of the Ayutthaya era but they also improved upon them. The [[Ramakien]] epic, recomposed and selected from various extant versions, during this period is widely considered to be more carefully worded than the old version lost to the fire. In addition, whereas the poet of Ayutthaya period did not care to adhere to strict metrical regulation of the indianised prosody, the compositions of Rattanakosin poets are so much more faithful to the metrical requirements. As a result, the poetry became generally more refined but also was rather difficult for the common man to appreciate. The literary circle of the early Rattanakosin era  still only accepted poets who had a thorough classical education, with deep learning in classical languages. It was in this period that a new poetical hero, [[Sunthorn Phu]] ({{lang-th|\u0e2a\u0e38\u0e19\u0e17\u0e23\u0e20\u0e39\u0e48}}) (1786-1855) emerged to defy the traditional taste of the aristocrat. Sunthorn Phu consciously moved away from a difficult and stately language of court poetry and composed mostly in a popular poetical form called ''klon suphap'' ({{lang-th|\u0e01\u0e25\u0e2d\u0e19\u0e2a\u0e38\u0e20\u0e32\u0e1e}}). He mastered and perfected the art of ''klon suphap'' and his verses in this genre are considered peerless in the Thai language to the present day. There were also other masterpieces of ''Klon-suphap'' poem from this era, such as \"[[Ka Kee]]\" \u2013 which influences the Cambodian ''[[Cambodian literature#Court literature|Ka key]]'' \u2013 by Chao Phraya Phrakhlang (Hon).\n\nThe literary recovery project also resulted in the improvement of prose composition - an area which had been neglected in the previous Kingdom. A translation committee was set up in 1785, during the reign of King Phra Phutthayotfa Chulalok ([[Rama I]]), to translate important foreign works for the learning of the Thai people. This includes the [[Mon people|Mon]] Chronicle ''[[Razadarit Ayedawbon|Rachathirat]]'' as well as Chinese classics, such as  [[Romance of the Three Kingdoms]] or Sam-kok ({{lang-th|\u0e2a\u0e32\u0e21\u0e01\u0e4a\u0e01}}), [[Investiture of the Gods]] or ''Fengshen'' ({{lang-th|\u0e2b\u0e49\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e2a\u0e34\u0e19}}), [[Water Margin]] or ''S\u00f2ngji\u0101ng'' ({{lang-th|\u0e0b\u0e49\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e01\u0e31\u0e4b\u0e07}}). These long prose works became a gold standard of Thai classical prose composition.\n\n===King Rama II: poet king of Thailand===\n[[file:Buddha Loetla Nabhalai portrait.jpg|thumb|right|150px|King Buddha Loetla Nabhalai]]\n\nKing [[Rama II of Siam|Phra Phutthaloetla Naphalai]], also known as King Rama II of Siam (r. 1809-1824), was a gifted poet and playwright and is also a great patron of artists. His reign was known as the \"golden age of Rattanakosin literature\". His literary salon was responsible for reviving and repairing many important works of literature which were damaged or lost during the sack of Ayutthaya. Poets, including ''[[Sunthorn Phu]]'', thrived under his patronage. King Loetlanaphalai was himself a poet and artist. He is generally ranked second <!--by whom?-->only to Sunthorn Phu in terms of poetic brilliance. As a young prince, he took part in recomposing the missing or damaged parts of Thai literary masterpieces, including ''[[Ramakien]]'' and ''[[Khun Chang Khun Phaen]]''.

Sunthorn Phu is best known for his epic poem ''[[Phra Aphai Mani]]'' ({{lang-th|\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e30\u0e2d\u0e20\u0e31\u0e22\u0e21\u0e13\u0e35}}), which he started in 1822 (while in jail) and finished in 1844. ''Phra Aphai Mani'' is a versified fantasy-adventure novel, a genre of Siamese literature known as ''nithan kham klon'' ({{lang-th|\u0e19\u0e34\u0e17\u0e32\u0e19\u0e04\u0e33\u0e01\u0e25\u0e2d\u0e19}}). It relates the adventures of the eponymous protagonist, Prince Aphai Mani, who is trained in the art of music such that the songs of his flute tame and disarm men, beasts, and gods. At the beginning of the story, Phra Aphai and his brother are banished from their kingdom because the young prince chooses to study music rather than to be a warrior. While in exile, Phra Aphai is kidnapped by a female [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]] (or an [[ogress]]) named ''Pii Sue Samut'' ('sea butterfly'; {{lang-th|\u0e1c\u0e35\u0e40\u0e2a\u0e37\u0e49\u0e2d\u0e2a\u0e21\u0e38\u0e17\u0e23}}) who falls in love with him after she hears his flute music. Longing to return home, Phra Aphai manages to escape the ogress with the help of a beautiful mermaid. He fathers two sons, one with the ogress and another with the mermaid, who later grow up to be heroes with superhuman powers. Phra Aphai slays Pii Sue Samut (the ogress) with the song of his flute and continues his voyage; he suffers more shipwrecks, is rescued, and then falls in love with a princess named Suwanmali. A duel breaks out between Phra Aphai and Prince Ussaren, Suwanmali's fianc\u00e9, with the maiden's hand as the prize. Phra Aphai slays his rival. ''Nang Laweng'', Ussaren's sister and queen of Lanka (Ceylon), vows revenge. She bewitches rulers of other nations with her peerless beauty and persuades them to raise a great coalition army to avenge her fallen brother. Phra Aphai, too, is bewitched by Nang Laweng's beauty. Nevertheless, he confronts Nang Laweng and they fall in love. The war and various troubles continue, but Phra Aphai and his sons prevail in the end. He appoints his sons as rulers of the cities he has won. Now tired of love and war, Phra Aphai abdicates the throne and retires to the forest with two of his wives to become ascetics.\n\n====Composition and versions====\nThe epic tale of ''Phra Aphai Mani'' is a massive work of poetry in ''klon suphap'' ({{lang-th|\u0e01\u0e25\u0e2d\u0e19\u0e2a\u0e38\u0e20\u0e32\u0e1e}}).

Sunthorn Phu, however, originally intended to end the story at the point where Phra Aphai abdicates the throne and withdraws. This leaves his original vision of the work at 25,098 b\u0101t (two line couplet) of poetry, 64 ''samut thai'' books. But Sunthorn Phu's literary patron wanted him to continue composing, which he did for many years. Today, the abridged version, i.e., his original 64 [[samut khoi|samut-thai]] volumes, or 25,098 couplets of poetry\u2014is regarded as the authoritative text of the epic.<ref name=#1/> It took Sunthorn Phu more than 20 years to compose (from c. 1822 or 1823 to 1844).\n\n''Phra Aphai Mani'' is Sunthorn Phu's [[masterpiece|chef-d'\u0153uvre]]. It breaks the literary tradition of earlier Thai poetic novels or ''nithan kham-klon'' ({{lang-th|\u0e19\u0e34\u0e17\u0e32\u0e19\u0e04\u0e33\u0e01\u0e25\u0e2d\u0e19}}) by including Western mythical creatures, such as mermaids, and contemporary inventions, such as [[Steamboat|steam-powered ships]] ({{lang-th|\u0e2a\u0e33\u0e40\u0e20\u0e32\u0e22\u0e19\u0e15\u0e4c}}) which only started to appear in Europe in the early-1800s. Sunthorn Phu also writes about a mechanical music player at the time when a [[phonograph|gramophone]] or a [[player piano|self-playing piano]] was yet to be invented. This made ''Phra Aphai Mani'' surprisingly futuristic for the time. Also, unlike other classical Thai epic poems, ''Phra Aphai Mani'' depicts various exploits of white mercenaries and pirates which reflects the ongoing colonization of Southeast Asia in the early-19th century. Phra Aphai himself is said to have learned \"to speak ''farang'' (European), Chinese, and Cham languages.\" Moreover, the locations of cities and islands in ''Phra Aphai Mani'' are not imagined but actually correspond to real geographical locations in the [[Andaman Sea]] as well as east of the [[Indian Ocean]]. Sunthorn Phu could also give an accurate description of modern sea voyage in that part of the world. This suggests that the Sunthorn Phu must have acquired this knowledge from foreign seafarers first-hand. The multi-cultural and the half-mythical, half-realistic setting of ''Phra Aphai Mani'' combined with Sunthorn Phu's poetic power, makes ''Phra Aphai Mani'' a masterpiece.<!-- according to whom? -->\n\n====Sunthorn Phu as the poet of two worlds====\nWestern colonialism was spreading into Southeast Asia when Sunthorn Phu was composing ''Phra Aphai Mani''. Many Thai literary critics have thus suggested that Sunthorn Phu may have intended his epic masterpiece to be an [[anti-colonialism]] story, disguised as a versified tale of fantasy adventures.<ref name=#2>{{cite web|url=http://www.sujitwongthes.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/stp50-115.pdf|title= \u0e1e\u0e23\u0e30\u0e2d\u0e20\u0e31\u0e22\u0e21\u0e13\u0e35\u0e27\u0e23\u0e23\u0e13\u0e04\u0e14\u0e35\u0e01\u0e32\u0e23\u0e40\u0e21\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e07 \u0e15\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e15\u0e49\u0e32\u0e19\u0e01\u0e32\u0e23\u0e25\u0e48\u0e32\u0e40\u0e21\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e02\u0e36\u0e49\u0e19|work=\u0e2a\u0e38\u0e08\u0e34\u0e15\u0e15\u0e4c \u0e27\u0e07\u0e29\u0e4c\u0e40\u0e17\u0e28}}</ref> [[Sujit Wongthes]], for example, proposes that Sunthorn Phu models ''Nang Laweng'', Phra Aphai's beautiful blonde female nemesis who later becomes his lover, after [[Queen Victoria]] of England.<ref name=#2/> He cites the fact that Sunthorn Phu portrays an English captain of a [[privateer]] (pirate ship) as a villainous character to support his theory.<ref name=#2/> In a literary sense, however, ''Phra Aphai Mani'' could perhaps be inspired by [[Ancient Greek literature#Epic poetry|Greek epic]]s and Persian literature, notably the [[Iliad]], the [[Odyssey]], the [[Argonauts]], and [[Thousand and One Nights]]. The structure of ''Phra Aphai Mani'' conforms to the [[monomyth]] structure, shared by other great epic stories. It is possible that Sunthorn Phu may have learned these epic stories from European missionaries, Catholic priests, or learned individuals who travelled to Siam during the early-19th century. Phra Aphai, the protagonist, resembles [[Orpheus]]\u2014the famed musician of the [[Argonauts]]\u2014rather than a warrior like [[Achilles]]. Moreover, Phra Aphai's odyssean journey conjures similarity with the [[Odysseus|King of Ithaca]]. ''Pii Sue Samut'' (\"the sea butterfly\"), a love-struck female titan who kidnaps the hero, reminds us of the nymph [[Calypso (mythology)|Calypso]]. Also, much like Odysseus, Phra Aphai's long voyage enables him to speak many languages and to discern the minds and customs of many foreign races. Phra Aphai's name ({{lang-th|\u0e2d\u0e20\u0e31\u0e22}}: 'to forgive') is pronounced quite similar to how \"[[Orpheus]]\" ({{lang-gr|\u1f48\u03c1\u03c6\u03b5\u03cd\u03c2}}) is pronounced in Greek. In addition, Nang Laweng's bewitching beauty, so captivating it drives nations to war, seems to match the reputation of [[Helen of Troy]]. Others have suggested that ''Nang Laweng'' may have been inspired by a story of a Christian princess, told in Persia's ''[[Thousand and One Nights]]'', who falls in love with a Muslim king.\n\nAll of this suggests that Sunthorn Phu was a Siamese bard with a bright and curious mind who absorbed, not only the knowledge of contemporary seafaring and Western inventions, but also stories of Greek classical epics from learned Europeans. In composing ''Phra Aphai Mani'', Sunthorn Phu demonstrates a grand poetic ambition. He becomes the first Thai writer to draw inspirations from Western literary sources and produces an epic based, loosely, on the amalgamation of those myths and legends. Thus, rather than writing with a political motive, Sunthorn Phu might simply have wanted to challenge the best poets and literature of the West.\n\n====Sunthorn Phu's other literary legacy====\n[[file:Sunthornphu_monument.jpg|right|thumb|230px|A sculpture of [[Sunthorn Phu]] near his birthplace in Rayong Province]]\n\nSunthorn Phu is also the master of the Siamese tradition of parting-and-longing poetry or ''[[nirat]]'' which was popular among Thai poets who journeyed away from loved ones. Sunthorn Phu composed many nirat poems, probably from 1807 when he was on a trip to Mueang Klaeng (\u0e40\u0e21\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e41\u0e01\u0e25\u0e07), a town between [[Rayong]] (his hometown) and [[Chanthaburi]]. There are many forms of \"travel\" or parting-and-longing poetry in the Thai language. In the Ayutthaya period, these were composed by noblemen (such as Prince Thammathibet (1715-1756)), whose sentimentality and expressions were refined and formal. Sunthorn Phu was different because he was a common man and his poetry is more fun (\u0e2a\u0e19\u0e38\u0e01), catchy, and humorous.{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}} Sunthorn Phu was probably not as classically trained as other Thai famous poets (who were often members of the royal family) in the past. Nidhi Eoseewong, a Thai historian, argues that Sunthorn Phu's success can be attributable to the rise of the [[bourgeoisie]] or the middle class audience\u2014following the transformation of Siam from a feudal society to a market economy\u2014who held different values and had different tastes from aristocrats.<ref>{{cite book|last=\u0e27\u0e07\u0e29\u0e4c\u0e40\u0e17\u0e28|first=\u0e2a\u0e38\u0e08\u0e34\u0e15\u0e15\u0e4c|title=\u0e23\u0e33\u0e1e\u0e31\u0e19\u0e1e\u0e34\u0e25\u0e32\u0e1b\u0e02\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e2a\u0e38\u0e19\u0e17\u0e23\u0e20\u0e39\u0e48|publisher=\u0e21\u0e2b\u0e32\u0e27\u0e34\u0e17\u0e22\u0e32\u0e25\u0e31\u0e22\u0e28\u0e34\u0e25\u0e1b\u0e32\u0e01\u0e23|year=2006|pages=67\u201371}}</ref>\n \nSunthorn Phu was therefore, like Shakespeare, a people's poet. Instead of exclusively writing to please aristocratic institutions or patrons, Sunthorn Phu also writes both to entertain and to instruct, which shows his confidence in his personal mission as a poet. His works were thus popular among common Siamese, and he was prolific enough to make a living from it. Sunthorn Phu exercised his \"copyright\" by allowing people to make copies of his ''nithan'' poems ({{lang-th|\u0e19\u0e34\u0e17\u0e32\u0e19\u0e04\u0e33\u0e01\u0e25\u0e2d\u0e19}}), such as ''Phra Aphai Mani'', for a fee.<ref>Damrong Rajanubhab (1975), Life and Works of Sunthorn Phu (Thai)</ref> This made Sunthorn Phu one of the first Thais to ever earn a living as an [[author]]. Although a bard of the royal court, he was disdained by many genteel and noble-born poets for appealing to the common people.{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nSunthorn Phu was a prolific poet. Many of Sunthorn Phu's works were lost or destroyed due to his sojourn lifestyle. However, much is still extant. He is known to have composed:\n* Nine ''nirat'' (travel) poems,\n* Four ''nithan kham klon'' or poetic stories ({{lang-th|\u0e19\u0e34\u0e17\u0e32\u0e19\u0e04\u0e33\u0e01\u0e25\u0e2d\u0e19}}), discounting ''Phra Aphai Mani'', namely:\n** K\u014dbut ({{lang-th|\u0e42\u0e04\u0e1a\u0e38\u0e15\u0e23}})\n** Phra Chai Suriya ({{lang-th|\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e30\u0e44\u0e0a\u0e22\u0e2a\u0e38\u0e23\u0e34\u0e22\u0e32}})\n** Laksanawong ({{lang-th|\u0e25\u0e31\u0e01\u0e29\u0e13\u0e30\u0e27\u0e07\u0e28\u0e4c}})\n** Singha-kraiphop ({{lang-th|\u0e2a\u0e34\u0e07\u0e2b\u0e44\u0e01\u0e23\u0e20\u0e1e}})\n* Three didactic moral-teaching poems,\n* Four ''b\u014dt h\u00e9 kl\u014fm'' ({{lang-th|\u0e1a\u0e17\u0e40\u0e2b\u0e48\u0e01\u0e25\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e21}}) or lullabies\n* One ''lakhon'' ({{lang-th|\u0e25\u0e30\u0e04\u0e23}}) or a dramatic play, namely ''Aphainur\u0101t'' ({{lang-th|\u0e2d\u0e20\u0e31\u0e22\u0e19\u0e38\u0e23\u0e32\u0e0a}})\n\n==Modern Thai literature==\nKings [[Rama V]] and [[Rama VI]] were also writers, mainly of [[non-fiction]] works as part of their programme to combine [[Western world|Western]] knowledge with traditional Thai culture.

Based on the tragic end of King Phra Lo, who died together with the two women he loved, Phra Phuean and Phra Phaeng, the daughters of the ruler of the [[Song District|city of Song]], it originated in a tale of [[Thai folklore]] and later became part of Thai literature.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110812204735/http://www.identity.opm.go.th/identity/doc/nis00854.PDF Thai Literature]</ref>\n\nTwentieth century Thai writers tended to produce light fiction rather than literature.

Gopinath, the fabulist [[A. D. Thompson]], as well as non-fiction by [[Gary Dale Cearley]].\n\n==Thai literary influence on neighboring countries==\nThai literature, especially its poetic tradition, has had a strong influence on neighboring countries, especially [[Myanmar|Burma]] and [[Cambodia]]. The two golden periods of [[Burmese literature]] were the direct consequences of the Thai literary influence.{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}} The first occurred during the two-decade period (1564\u20131583) when the [[Toungoo|Toungoo Dynasty]] made [[Siam]] a vassal state. The conquest incorporated many Thai elements into Burmese literature. Most evident were the ''[[Yadu (poetry)|yadu]]'' or ''yatu'' ({{my|\u101b\u102c\u1010\u102f}}), an emotional and philosophic verse, and the ''[[yagan]]'' ({{my|\u101b\u102c\u1000\u1014\u103a}}) genre. The next transmission of Thai literary influence to Burma happened in the aftermath of the fall of Ayutthaya Kingdom in 1767. After a second  conquest of [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Ayutthaya]] (Thailand), many Siamese royal dancers and poets were brought back to the court of [[Konbaung Dynasty|Konbaung]]. Ramakien, the Thai version of ''[[Ramayana]]'' ({{my|\u101b\u102c\u1019\u101a\u1014}}) was introduced and was adapted in Burmese where it is now called [[Yama Zatdaw]]. Many dramatic songs and poems were transliterated directly from the Thai language. In addition, the Burmese also adopted the Thai tradition of ''[[Nirat]]'' poetry, which became popular among the Burmese royal class. Burmese literature during this period was therefore modeled after the ''Ramayana'', and dramatic plays were patronised by the Burmese court.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://goldenlandpages.com/hotspots/rama/rama.htm|title=Ramayana in Myanmar's Heart|accessdate=5 September 2006|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061029183721/http://www.goldenlandpages.com/hotspots/rama/rama.htm|archivedate=29 October 2006}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Map of the Rattanakosin Kingdom.svg|thumb|right|180px|The early [[Rattanakosin Kingdom]] and its political and cultural hegemony (1809)]]\n\nCambodia had fallen under Siamese hegemony in the reign of [[Naresuan|King Naresuan]]. But it was during the [[Thonburi Kingdom]] that the high cultures of the Rattanakosin kingdom were systematically transmitted to a Cambodian court that absorbed them voraciously. As F\u00e9d\u00e9ric Maurel, a French historian, notes:\n\n{{quote|From the close of the eighteenth century and through the nineteenth century, a number of Khmer pages, classical women dancers, and musicians studied with Thai ajarn (masters or teachers) in Cambodia. The presence of this Thai elite in Cambodia contributed to the development of strong Thai cultural influence among the Khmer upper classes.

Some of these poetical forms\u2014notably ''Khlong'' - have been shared between the speakers of tai languages since ancient time (before the emergence of Siam).

This literary influence changed the course of the Thai or Siamese language\u2014setting it apart from other ''tai'' languages\u2014by increasing the number of Sanskrit and Pali words and imposing the demand on the Thai to develop a writing system that preserved the orthography of Sanskrit words for literary purposes. By the 15th century, the Thai language had evolved into a distinctive medium along with a nascent literary identity of a new nation. It allowed Siamese poets to compose in different poetical styles and mood\u2014from playful and humorous rhymed verses, to romantic and elegant ''khlong'' and to polished and imperious ''chan'' prosodies which were modified from classical Sanskrit meters. Thai poets experimented with these different prosodic forms, producing innovative \"hybrid\" poems such as ''Lilit'' ({{lang-th|\u0e25\u0e34\u0e25\u0e34\u0e15}}\u2014an interleave of [[Thai poetry#Khlong|''khlong'']] and [[Thai poetry#Kap|''kap'']] or [[Thai poetry#Rai|''rai'']] verses), or ''Kap hor Klong'' ({{lang-th|\u0e01\u0e32\u0e1e\u0e22\u0e4c\u0e2b\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e42\u0e04\u0e25\u0e07}} - a series of [[Thai poetry#Khlong|''khlong'']] poems each of which is enveloped by [[Thai poetry#Kap|''kap'']] verses). The Thai thus developed a keen mind and a keen ear for poetry. To maximize this new literary medium, however, a rather intensive classical education in Pali and Sanskrit was required. This made \"serious poetry\" an occupation of the noble classes. However, B.J. Terwiel notes, citing a 17th-century Thai text book ''Jindamanee'', that scribes and common Siamese men, too, were encouraged to learn basic Pali and Sanskrit terms for career advancement.<ref name=\"Terwiel-1996\" />{{RP|322-323}} Thai poetry and literary production came to dominate the learned literature of the tai-speaking world from the mid-Ayutthaya period until the 20th century.

[[Thailand]]'s [[national epic]] is a version of the [[Ramayana]] called the ''[[Ramakien]]'', translated from Sanskrit and rearranged into Siamese verses. The importance of the Ramayana epic in Thailand is due to the Thai's adoption of the Hindu religio-political ideology of kingship, as embodied by the Lord Rama. The former Siamese capital, Ayutthaya, was named after the holy city of [[Ayodhya]], the city of Lord Rama. All Thai kings have been referred to as \"Rama\" to the present day.\n\nThe mythical tales and epic cycle of ''Ramakien'' provide the Siamese with a rich and perennial source for dramatic materials. The royal court of Ayutthaya developed classical dramatic forms of expression called ''[[khon]]'' and ''[[Lakhon nok|lakhon]]''. ''Ramakien'' played a great role in shaping these dramatic arts. During the Ayutthaya period, ''khon'', or a dramatized version of Ramakien, was classified as ''[[lakhon nai]]'' or a theatrical performance reserved for aristocratic audiences. A French diplomat, Simon de La Loub\u00e8re, witnessed and documented it in 1687, during a formal diplomatic mission sent by King [[Louis XIV]].<ref>{{cite book|first=Simon|last=La Loub\u00e8re|title=A new historical relation of the kingdom of Siam|publisher=London: Printed by F.L. for Tho.

The ''Trai Phum Phra Ruang'' explains the composition of the universe, which, according to the Theravada Buddhist Thai, consists of three different \"worlds\" or levels of existence and their respective mythological inhabitants and creatures. The year of composition was dated at 1345 CE, whereas the authorship is traditionally attributed to the then designated heir to the throne and later King [[Mahathammaracha I|LiThai]] ({{lang-th|\u0e1e\u0e0d\u0e32\u0e25\u0e34\u0e44\u0e17\u0e22}}) of Sukhothai. ''Traibhumikatha'' is a work of high scholarly standard. In composing it, King Lithai had to consult over 30 Buddhist treatises, including [[Tripitaka]] ({{lang-th|\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e30\u0e44\u0e15\u0e23\u0e1b\u0e34\u0e0e\u0e01}}) and [[Milinda Panha]].

The first Lilit poem to appear is ''[[Lilit Yuan Phai]]'' ({{lang-th|\u0e25\u0e34\u0e25\u0e34\u0e15\u0e22\u0e27\u0e19\u0e1e\u0e48\u0e32\u0e22}} 'the defeat of the Yuan', composed during the early-Ayutthaya period (c. 1475 CE). ''Yuan Phai'' is the Thai equivalent of the Song of Roland. It is an epic war poem of about 1180 lines, narrating the key events of the war between King Borommatrailokkanat (1448\u20131488) and King [[Tilokaraj]] of [[Lan Na]], and providing a [[victory ode]] for the King of Siam. The importance of ''Yuan Phai'' is not limited to just being the oldest surviving example of Lilit poetry. It serves also as an important historical account of the war between Siam and Lan Na, as well as an evidence of the Siamese's [[Yuan Phai#Theory of kingship|theory of kingship]] that was evolving during the reign of Borommatrailokkanat.\n\nAnother famous piece of lilit poetry is ''[[Lilit Phra Lo]]'' ({{lang-th|\u0e25\u0e34\u0e25\u0e34\u0e15\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e30\u0e25\u0e2d}}) (c. 1500), a tragico-romantic epic poem that employed a variety of poetical forms. ''Phra Lo'' is roughly 2,600 lines in length. It is one of the major ''lilit'' compositions still surviving today and is considered to be the best among them. ''Phra Lo'' is considered to be one of the earliest Thai poems that evoke sadness and tragic emotions. The story ends with the tragic death of the eponymic hero and two beautiful princesses with whom he was in love. The erotic theme of the poem also made ''Phra Lo'' controversial among the Siamese noble classes for generations. While its author is unknown, ''Phra Lo'' is believed to have been written around the beginning of King Ramathibodi II's reign (1491-1529), and certainly not later than 1656, since a part of it was recited in a Thai textbook composed in the [[King Narai]]'s reign. The plot probably came from a folk tale in the north of Thailand. Its tragic story has universal appeal and its composition is considered to be a high achievement under the Thai poetic tradition.{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\n===<span id=\"Mahachat Kham Luang\"></span><span id=\"Maha Chat Kham Luang\"></span><span id=\"Mahachat Khamluang\"></span><span id=\"Mahajati Kham Luang\"></span>Maha-chat Kham Luang: the \"Great Birth\" sermon===\nThe third major work of this period is ''[[Mahajati Kham Luang]]'' or ''Mahachat Kham Luang'' ({{lang-th|\u0e21\u0e2b\u0e32\u0e0a\u0e32\u0e15\u0e34\u0e04\u0e33\u0e2b\u0e25\u0e27\u0e07}}), the Thai epic account of the \"Great Birth\" (maha-jati) of [[Vessantara]] [[Bodhisatta]], the last final life before he became the Buddha. ''Mahachat'' was written in the style of the Buddhist chant (\u0e23\u0e48\u0e32\u0e22) combining Pali verses with Thai poetical narrative. In 1492, King Borommatrailokkanat authorized a group of scholars to write a poem based on the story of [[Vessantara Jataka]], believed to be the greatest of Buddha's incarnations. Their joint effort was this great work and the precedence of reciting Maha, the Great Life, was then established. ''Mahachat'' has traditionally been divided into 13 books. Six of them were lost during the sack of Ayutthaya and were ordered to be recomposed in 1815. There are many versions of ''Mahachat'' in Thailand today.\n\n===<span id=\"Nirat\"></span> Nirat: The Siamese tradition of parting and longing poetry===\nThe ''nirat'' ({{lang-th|\u0e19\u0e34\u0e23\u0e32\u0e28}}) is a lyrical genre, popular in Thai literature, which can be translated as 'farewell poetry'. The core of the poetry is a travel description, but essential is the longing for the absent lover. The poet describes his journey through landscapes, towns, and villages, but he regularly interrupts his description to express his feelings for and thoughts of the abandoned lover. Nirat poetry probably originated from the Northern Thai people. ''Nirat [[Hariphunchai]]'' (1637) is traditionally believed to be the first Nirat to appear in the Thai language, during the reign of King [[Prasat Thong]]. However, the Thai ''nirat'' tradition could prove to be much older, depending on whether ''Khlong Thawatossamat'' could be dated back to the reign of King [[Borommatrailokkanat]] (1431-1488). Siamese poets composed Nirat with different poetical device. During the Ayutthaya period, poets liked to compose Nirat poems using ''[[Thai poetry#Khlong|''khlong'']]'' (\u0e42\u0e04\u0e25\u0e07) and ''[[Thai poetry#Kap|''kap'']]'' (\u0e01\u0e32\u0e1e\u0e22\u0e4c) metrical variety.

Since nirat poems record what the poet sees or experiences during his journey, they represent an information source for the Siamese culture as well as history in the premodern time. This poetical genre later spread, first to Myanmar in the late 18th Century, and then Cambodia in the mid 19th century, at the time when Cambodia was heavily influenced by the Siamese culture.<ref>{{cite journal|first=Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric|last= Maurel|title=A Khmer \"nirat\", 'Travel in France during the Paris World Exhibition of 1900': influences from the Thai?|jstor=23749987|journal= South East Asia Research|volume=10|number=1|year=2002|pages=99\u2013112|doi= 10.5367/000000002101297026}}</ref> Famous poems in the ''nirat'' genre during the Ayutthaya period are:\n* ''Khlong Thawatossam\u0101t'' (c. 1450?) ({{lang-th|\u0e42\u0e04\u0e25\u0e07\u0e17\u0e27\u0e32\u0e17\u0e28\u0e21\u0e32\u0e2a}}; \"the Twelve-Month Song\"): ''Thawatossamat'' is a 1,037-line nirat poem in ''khlong'' meter. It is believed to be composed by a group of royal poets rather than by one man. It is formerly thought to be composed during the reign of King [[Narai]], but in fact the language of this poem suggests a much older period. The large number of Sanskrit words in ''Thawatossamat'' suggests that it was composed perhaps in the reign of King [[Borommatrailokkanat]] (1431-1488) when such literary style was common. ''Thawatossamat'' is also an important work of Thai literature because it records the knowledge about specific traditions and norms practiced by Thai people in each month of a year. ''Thawatossamat'' is also unique among the ''nirat'' genre of poetry because the poet(s) do not travel anywhere but they nonetheless express the longing and sadness that each month of separation from their loved ones brings.  \n* ''Khlong Kamsuan S\u012bpr\u0101t'' ({{lang-th|\u0e42\u0e04\u0e25\u0e07\u0e01\u0e33\u0e2a\u0e23\u0e27\u0e25\u0e28\u0e23\u0e35\u0e1b\u0e23\u0e32\u0e0a\u0e0d\u0e4c}}; \"the mournful song of S\u012bpr\u0101t\") by S\u012bpr\u0101t: A nirat poem composed in ''khlong d\u00e0n'' ({{lang-th|\u0e42\u0e04\u0e25\u0e07\u0e14\u0e31\u0e49\u0e19}}) meter.\n* ''Kap Hor Khlong Nirat Thans\u014dk'' ({{lang-th|\u0e01\u0e32\u0e1e\u0e22\u0e4c\u0e2b\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e42\u0e04\u0e25\u0e07\u0e19\u0e34\u0e23\u0e32\u0e28\u0e18\u0e32\u0e23\u0e42\u0e28\u0e01}}; \"a nirat at Thans\u014dk stream in kap-hor-khlong verse\") (c. 1745) by Prince Thammathibet: a nirat poem composed in a special style of ''kap hor khlong'' - where each of the ''khlong'' poems is enclosed in ''kap'' verses. This is a rare example of a highly polished and stately style of Thai poetry. ''Nirat Thans\u014dk'' is 152-stanza long (1,022 lines).\n* ''Kap Hor Khlong Praphat Than-Thongdang'' ({{lang-th|\u0e01\u0e32\u0e1e\u0e22\u0e4c\u0e2b\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e42\u0e04\u0e25\u0e07\u0e1b\u0e23\u0e30\u0e1e\u0e32\u0e2a\u0e18\u0e32\u0e23\u0e17\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e41\u0e14\u0e07}}; \"a royal visit at Than-Thongdang stream in kap-hor-khlong verse\") (c. 1745) by Prince Thammathibet. Another rare example of ''kap hor khlong'' genre. Only 108 stanzas of this poem have been found. The other half seems to have been lost.\n\n===The Siamese epic ''Khun Chang Khun Phaen''===\n[[Image:SephaPerformance.jpg|200px|thumb|right|Modern performance of ''sepha'' oral recitation of Thai poetry.]]\n\nIn the Ayutthaya period, folktales also flourished. One of the most famous folktales is the story of ''[[Khun Chang Khun Phaen]]'' ({{lang-th|\u0e02\u0e38\u0e19\u0e0a\u0e49\u0e32\u0e07\u0e02\u0e38\u0e19\u0e41\u0e1c\u0e19}}), referred to in Thailand simply as \"''Khun Phaen''\", which combines the elements of romantic comedy and heroic adventures, ending in the tragic death of one of the main protagonists. The epic of ''Khun Chang Khun Phaen'' (KCKP) revolves around ''Khun Phaen'', a Siamese general with super-human magical power who served the King of Ayutthaya, and his love-triangle relationship between himself, Khun Chang, and a beautiful Siamese girl named Wan-Thong. The composition of KCKP, much like other [[oral tradition|orally-transmitted]] epics, evolved over time. It originated as a recreational recitation or ''[[sepha]]'' within the Thai oral tradition from around the beginning of the 17th century (c.1600). Siamese [[troubadour]]s and [[minstrel]]s added more subplots and embellished scenes to the original storyline as time went on.<ref name=Baker-2009>{{cite journal|last1=Baker|first1=Chris|last2=Phongpaichit|first2=Pasuk|title=The Career of Khun Chang Khun Phaen|journal=Journal of the Siam Society|volume=97|year=2009|pages=1\u201342|url=http://www.siam-society.org/pub_JSS/jss097BakerPasuk.pdf}}</ref> By the late period of the Ayutthaya Kingdom, it had attained the current shape as a long work of [[epic poem]] with the length of about 20,000 lines, spanning 43 ''[[samut khoi|samut thai]]'' books. The version that exists today was composed with ''klon'' meter throughout and is referred to in Thailand as ''nithan Kham Klon'' ({{lang-th|\u0e19\u0e34\u0e17\u0e32\u0e19\u0e04\u0e33\u0e01\u0e25\u0e2d\u0e19}}) meaning a ''poetic tale''. A standard edition of KCKP, as published by the National Library, is 1085-page long.\n[[file:KCKP_samut_thai_mss_2.jpg|thumb|right|295px|Samut Thai mss of ''Khun Chang Phun Phaen''; the text recounts the scene where Khun Phaen rescues Wanthong from arrest]]\n\nAs the national epic of the Siamese people, ''Khun Chang Khun Phaen'' is unique among other major epic poems of the world in that it concerns the struggles, romance, and martial exploits of non-aristocratic protagonists - with a high degree of [[Khun Chang Khun Phaen#Realism|realism]] - rather than being chiefly about the affairs of great kings, noble men or deities.<ref name=\"Baker-2009\" />{{RP|1}} The realism of KCKP also makes it standout from other epic literature of the region. As Baker and Phongpaichit note, the depiction of war between Ayutthaya and Chiangmai in ''Khun Chang Khun Phaen'' is \"[p]ossibly ... the most realistic depiction of pre-modern warfare in the region, portraying the adventure, the risk, the horror, and the gain.\"<ref name=\"Baker-2009\" />{{RP|14}} KCKP additionally contains rich and detailed accounts of the traditional Thai society during the late Ayutthaya period, including religious practices, superstitious beliefs, social relations, household management, military tactics, court and legal procedures etc. To this day, KCKP is regarded as the masterpiece of Thai literature for its high entertainment value - with engaging plots even by modern standard - and its wealth of cultural knowledge. Marveling at the sumptuous milieu of old Siamese customs, beliefs, and practices in which the story takes place, [[William J. Gedney]], a philologist specialized in Southeast Asian languages, commented that: \u201cI have often thought that if all other information on traditional Thai culture were to be lost, the whole complex could be reconstructed from this marvelous text.\u201d A complete English prose translation of KCKP was published by Chris Baker and P. Phongpaichit in 2010.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Baker|first1=Chris|last2=Phongpaichit|first2=Pasuk|title=The Tale of Khun Chang Khun Phaen|publisher=Silkworm Books|year=2010|pages=960|isbn=978-9-7495-1195-4}}</ref>\n\n===The folk legend of Sri Thanonchai===\nAnother popular character among Ayutthaya folktales is the trickster, the best known is [[Sri Thanonchai]] ({{lang-th|\u0e28\u0e23\u0e35\u0e18\u0e19\u0e0d\u0e0a\u0e31\u0e22}}), usually a heroic figure who teaches or learns moral lessons and is known for his charm, wit, and verbal dexterity.<ref>Arne Kislenko (2004) ''Culture and Customs of Thailand''. Greenwood. {{ISBN|9780313321283}}, p. 46</ref> Sri Thanonchai is a classic trickster-hero. Like Shakespeare's villains, such as Iago, Sri Thanonchai's motive is unclear. He simply uses his trickeries, jests and pranks to upend lives and affairs of others which sometimes results in tragic outcomes. The story of Sri Thanonchai is well known among both Thai and Lao people. In the Lao tradition, Sri Thanonchai is called ''Xiang Mieng''. A Lao-Isaan version of ''Xiang Mieng'' describes Sri Thanonchai as an Ayutthayan trickster.<ref>{{cite web|title=Sepha Sri Thanonchai Xiang Mieng|website=Vajirayana.org|url=http://vajirayana.org/%E0%B9%80%E0%B8%AA%E0%B8%A0%E0%B8%B2-%E0%B9%80%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%B7%E0%B9%88%E0%B8%AD%E0%B8%87%E0%B8%A8%E0%B8%A3%E0%B8%B5%E0%B8%98%E0%B8%99%E0%B8%8D%E0%B9%84%E0%B8%8A%E0%B8%A2%E0%B9%80%E0%B8%8A%E0%B8%B5%E0%B8%A2%E0%B8%87%E0%B9%80%E0%B8%A1%E0%B8%B5%E0%B9%88%E0%B8%A2%E0%B8%87/%E0%B8%84%E0%B8%B3%E0%B8%99%E0%B8%B3}}</ref>\n\n===The Legend of Phra Malai (1737)===\n[[File:Phra_Malai.png|thumb|270px|right|Phra Malai's journey as depicted in an illustrated Thai manuscript written in [[Khmer language|Khmer]] script (Khom) dated to the mid-nineteenth century.]]\nThe Legend of [[Phra Malai]] ({{lang-th|\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e30\u0e21\u0e32\u0e25\u0e31\u0e22\u0e04\u0e33\u0e2b\u0e25\u0e27\u0e07}}) is a religious epic adventure composed by Prince [[Thammathibet]], one of the greatest Ayutthayan poets, in 1737, although the story's origin is assumed to be much older, being based on a Pali text. Phra Malai figures prominently in Thai art, religious treatises, and rituals associated with the afterlife, and the story is one of the most popular subjects of 19th-century illustrated Thai manuscripts.\n\nPrince Thammathibet's ''Phra Malai'' is composed in a style that alternates between ''rai'' and ''khlong sii-suphap.'' It tells a story of Phra Malai, a Buddhist monk of the Theravada tradition said to have attained supernatural powers through his accumulated merit and meditation. Phra Malai makes a journey into the realm of hell (naraka) to teach Buddhism to the underworld creatures and the deceased.<ref>{{cite web|title=A Thai book of merit: Phra Malai's journeys to heaven and hell|website=Asian and African studies blog|url=https://blogs.bl.uk/asian-and-african/2013/09/a-thai-book-of-merit-phra-malais-journeys-to-heaven-and-hell.html}}</ref> Phra Malai then returns to the world of the living and tells people the story of the underworld, reminding listeners to make good merits and to adhere to the buddhist's teachings in order to avoid damnation. While in the human realm, Phra Malai receives an offering of eight lotus flowers from a poor woodcutter, which he eventually offers at the Chulamani Chedi, a heavenly stupa believed to contain a relic of the Buddha. In Tavatimsa heaven, Phra Malai converses with the god Indra and the Buddha-to-come, Metteyya, who reveals to the monk insights about the future of mankind. Through recitations of Phra Malai the karmic effects of human actions were taught to the faithful at funerals and other merit-making occasions. Following Buddhist precepts, obtaining merit, and attending performances of the Vessantara Jataka all counted as virtues that increased the chances of a favourable rebirth, or Nirvana in the end.\n\n===Other notable works from the Ayutthaya Period===\nThree most famous poets of the Ayutthaya Period were [[S\u012bpr\u0101t]] (1653-1688) ({{lang-th|\u0e28\u0e23\u0e35\u0e1b\u0e23\u0e32\u0e0a\u0e0d\u0e4c}}), [[Phra Maha Raja-Kru]] ({{lang-th|\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e30\u0e21\u0e2b\u0e32\u0e23\u0e32\u0e0a\u0e04\u0e23\u0e39}}), and Prince [[Thammathibet]] (1715-1755) ({{lang-th|\u0e40\u0e08\u0e49\u0e32\u0e1f\u0e49\u0e32\u0e18\u0e23\u0e23\u0e21\u0e18\u0e34\u0e40\u0e1a\u0e28\u0e44\u0e0a\u0e22\u0e40\u0e0a\u0e29\u0e10\u0e4c\u0e2a\u0e38\u0e23\u0e34\u0e22\u0e27\u0e07\u0e28\u0e4c}}). Sriprat composed ''Anirut Kham Chan'' (\"the tale of Prince [[Anirudha]] in [[Thai poetry#Chan|''kham chan'']] poetry\") which is considered to be one of the best [[Thai poetry#Chan|''kham chan'']] composition in the Thai language. Prince Thammathibet composed many extant refined poems, including romantic \"parting and longing\" poems. He also composed [[Royal Barge Procession]] songs or ''kap h\u00e9 reu'' ({{lang-th|\u0e01\u0e32\u0e1e\u0e22\u0e4c\u0e40\u0e2b\u0e48\u0e40\u0e23\u0e37\u0e2d}}) to be used during the King's grand seasonal water-way procession which is a unique tradition of the Siamese. His barge-procession songs are still considered best in the Thai repertoire of royal procession poems. Other notable literary works of the mid and late Ayutthaya Kingdom include:\n[[File:Bathing Ceremony of Vajirunhit.jpg|right|thumb|300px|The royal barge procession on 14 January 1886 before the Royal Ratchaworadit Pier]]\n\n* ''Sue-ko Kham Chan'' ({{lang-th|\u0e40\u0e2a\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e42\u0e04\u0e04\u0e33\u0e09\u0e31\u0e19\u0e17\u0e4c}}) (c. 1657) by Phra Maha Raja-Kru ({{lang-th|\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e30\u0e21\u0e2b\u0e32\u0e23\u0e32\u0e0a\u0e04\u0e23\u0e39}}). Sue-ko Kham Chan is the earliest-known surviving ''kham chan'' ({{lang-th|\u0e04\u0e33\u0e09\u0e31\u0e19\u0e17\u0e4c}}) poem to appear in the Thai language. It is based on a story from [[Pa\u00f1\u00f1\u0101sa J\u0101taka]] ({{lang-th|\u0e1b\u0e31\u0e0d\u0e0d\u0e32\u0e2a\u0e0a\u0e32\u0e14\u0e01}}) or Apocryphal Birth-Stories of the Buddha. ''Sue-ko Kham Chan'' narrates a story concerning a virtuous brotherly-like friendship between a calf and a tiger cub. Their love for each other impresses a [[rishi]] who asks the gods to turn them into humans on the merits of their virtues. ''Sue-ko Kham Chan'' teaches an important concept of Buddhist teaching according to which one becomes a human being, the highest species of the animal, not because he was born such, but because of his virtue or ''sila-dhamma'' ({{lang-th|\u0e28\u0e35\u0e25\u0e18\u0e23\u0e23\u0e21}}).     \n* ''Samutta-K\u014dt Kham Chan'' ({{lang-th|\u0e2a\u0e21\u0e38\u0e17\u0e23\u0e42\u0e06\u0e29\u0e04\u0e33\u0e09\u0e31\u0e19\u0e17\u0e4c}}) (c. 1657) by Phra Maha Raja-Kru. ''Samutta-K\u014dt kham chan'' is a religious-themed epic poem based on a story of [[Pa\u00f1\u00f1\u0101sa-J\u0101taka|Pannasa-Jataka]]. The poem is 2,218-stanza long (around 8,800 lines). However, the original poet, Phra Maha Raja-Kru, only composed 1,252 stanzas and did not finish it. King [[Narai]] (1633-1688) further composed 205 stanza during his reign and [[Paramanuchitchinorot|Paramanuchit-Chinorot]], a noble-born poet monk and the [[Supreme Patriarch of Thailand]], finished it in 1849. Samut-Koat Kham Chan was praised by the Literature Society as one of the best ''kham chan'' poems in the Thai language.\n* ''Jindamanee'' ({{lang-th|\u0e08\u0e34\u0e19\u0e14\u0e32\u0e21\u0e13\u0e35}}; \"Gems of the Mind\"): the first Thai grammar book and considered to be the most important book for teaching Thai language until the early 20th century. The first part was probably written during the reign of King [[Ekathotsarot]] ({{lang-th|\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e30\u0e40\u0e08\u0e49\u0e32\u0e40\u0e2d\u0e01\u0e32\u0e17\u0e28\u0e23\u0e16}}) (1605-1620).<ref>{{cite web|title=Jindamanee|website=Thairat|url=http://www.thairath.co.th/content/841344|language=Thai}}</ref> The later part was composed by Phra Horathibodi, a royal scholar, in the reign of King [[Narai]] (1633-1688). ''Jindamanee'' instructs not only the grammar and the orthography of Thai language, but also the art of poetry. ''Jindamanee'' contains many valuable samples of Thai poems from works which are now lost. For a 400-year-old Asian grammar book, ''Jindamanee'' 's didactic model is based on sound linguistic principles. Scholars believe that European knowledge on grammar, especially via French missionaries stationed in Siam during the 17th century, may have influenced its composition. \n[[File:Yak-female-Bangkok1210.JPG|thumb|right|260px|Statue of a ''[[yaksha|yak\u1e63\u012b]]'', one of the main characters of ''[[The Twelve Sisters|Phra Rot Meri]]'']]\n* ''[[Nang Sib Song]]'' ({{lang-th|\u0e19\u0e32\u0e07\u0e2a\u0e34\u0e1a\u0e2a\u0e2d\u0e07}}; \"the twelve princesses\")  or ''Phra Rotthasen'' ({{lang-th|\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e30\u0e23\u0e16\u0e40\u0e2a\u0e19}}) or ''Phra Rot Meri'' ({{lang-th|\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e30\u0e23\u0e16\u0e40\u0e21\u0e23\u0e35}}): an indigenous folk tale, based on a previous life of the Buddha, popularized in many Southeast Asian countries. There are several poetic retellings of this story in the Thai language. The story of ''Nang Sib Song'' concerns the life of twelve sisters abandoned by their parents and adopted by an Ogress ''Santhumala'' disguised as a beautiful lady. The conclusion is the sad love story about the only surviving son of the twelve sisters, ''Phra Rotthasen'' (\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e30\u0e23\u0e16\u0e40\u0e2a\u0e19) with ''Meri'' (\u0e40\u0e21\u0e23\u0e35) the adopted daughter of ogress Santhumala. This is a story of unrequited love that ends with the death of the lovers, Rotthsen and Meri.       \n* ''[[Dance of Thailand|Lakhon]]'' ({{lang-th|\u0e25\u0e30\u0e04\u0e23}}): ''Lakhon'' is a highly regarded type dramatic performance and literature in Siam. It is divided into two categories: ''lakhon nai'' ({{lang-th|\u0e25\u0e30\u0e04\u0e23\u0e43\u0e19}}), dramatic plays reserved only for the aristocrats, and ''lakhon n\u014dk'' ({{lang-th|\u0e25\u0e30\u0e04\u0e23\u0e19\u0e2d\u0e01}}), plays for the enjoyment of the commoners. Only three plays have traditionally been classified as ''[[lakhon nai]]'': ''[[Ramakien]]'', ''[[Aniruddha|Anirut]]'', and ''[[Panji (prince)|Inao]]''. Fifteen plays survived the destruction of Ayutthaya. Among the most well-known are: \n** ''S\u0101ng-thong'' ({{lang-th|\u0e2a\u0e31\u0e07\u0e02\u0e4c\u0e17\u0e2d\u0e07}}) - a play based on a Buddhist ''[[jataka]]'' story of a noble man who hides his identity by disguising as a black-skinned savage. Its popularity was revived during the early Rattanakosin era by King [[Rama II of Siam|Rama II]] who rewrote many parts of it as ''lakorn nok''.\n** ''[[Panji (prince)|Inao]]'' ({{lang-th|\u0e2d\u0e34\u0e40\u0e2b\u0e19\u0e32}}) - one of the three major ''[[lakhon nai]]s''. Inao was a very popular drama among the Siamese aristocrats of the late-Ayutthaya period. It is based on the East-Javanese legend of Prince [[Panji (prince)|Panji]]. Inao continued to be popular in the early-Rattanakosin era during which there are many adaptations of Inao in Thai language. The sack of Ayutthaya spread its popularity to Burma.\n** ''Phikul Thong'' ({{lang-th|\u0e1e\u0e34\u0e01\u0e38\u0e25\u0e17\u0e2d\u0e07}}) or ''Ph\u00f3m H\u00f3m'' ({{lang-th|\u0e19\u0e32\u0e07\u0e1c\u0e21\u0e2b\u0e2d\u0e21}}):\n\n==Early Rattanakosin Period==\nWith the arrival of the [[Rattanakosin era]], Thai literature experienced a rebirth of creative energy and reached its most prolific period. The Rattanakosin era is characterized by the imminent pressure to return to the literary perfection and to recover important literary works lost during the war between Ayutthaya and the [[Konbaung Dynasty|Konbuang Empire]]. A considerable poetic and creative energy of this period was spent to revive or repair the national treasures which had been lost or damaged following the fall of the old Capital. Epics, notably ''[[Ramakien]]'' and ''[[Khun Chang Khun Phaen]]'', were recomposed or collected - with aid of surviving poets and troubadours who had committed them to memory (not rare in the 18th Century) - and written down for preservation. Nevertheless, many court singers and poets were carried away or killed by the invading Burmese army and some works were lost forever. But it goes to show how rich the Siamese literary creations, especially poetical works, must have been before the war, since so much still survived even after the destruction of their former Kingdom. \n[[File:104 Ramakien Murals (9148225737).jpg|thumb|left|300px|Mural of the [[Ramakien|Ramakien Epic]], revised by King Rama I, on the walls of [[Wat Phra Kaew]], Bangkok]]\n\nThe royal poets of the early Rattanakosin did not merely recompose the damaged or lost works of the Ayutthaya era but they also improved upon them. The [[Ramakien]] epic, recomposed and selected from various extant versions, during this period is widely considered to be more carefully worded than the old version lost to the fire. In addition, whereas the poet of Ayutthaya period did not care to adhere to strict metrical regulation of the indianised prosody, the compositions of Rattanakosin poets are so much more faithful to the metrical requirements. As a result, the poetry became generally more refined but also was rather difficult for the common man to appreciate. The literary circle of the early Rattanakosin era  still only accepted poets who had a thorough classical education, with deep learning in classical languages. It was in this period that a new poetical hero, [[Sunthorn Phu]] ({{lang-th|\u0e2a\u0e38\u0e19\u0e17\u0e23\u0e20\u0e39\u0e48}}) (1786-1855) emerged to defy the traditional taste of the aristocrat. Sunthorn Phu consciously moved away from a difficult and stately language of court poetry and composed mostly in a popular poetical form called ''klon suphap'' ({{lang-th|\u0e01\u0e25\u0e2d\u0e19\u0e2a\u0e38\u0e20\u0e32\u0e1e}}). He mastered and perfected the art of ''klon suphap'' and his verses in this genre are considered peerless in the Thai language to the present day. There were also other masterpieces of ''Klon-suphap'' poem from this era, such as \"[[Ka Kee]]\" \u2013 which influences the Cambodian ''[[Cambodian literature#Court literature|Ka key]]'' \u2013 by Chao Phraya Phrakhlang (Hon).\n\nThe literary recovery project also resulted in the improvement of prose composition - an area which had been neglected in the previous Kingdom. A translation committee was set up in 1785, during the reign of King Phra Phutthayotfa Chulalok ([[Rama I]]), to translate important foreign works for the learning of the Thai people. This includes the [[Mon people|Mon]] Chronicle ''[[Razadarit Ayedawbon|Rachathirat]]'' as well as Chinese classics, such as  [[Romance of the Three Kingdoms]] or Sam-kok ({{lang-th|\u0e2a\u0e32\u0e21\u0e01\u0e4a\u0e01}}), [[Investiture of the Gods]] or ''Fengshen'' ({{lang-th|\u0e2b\u0e49\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e2a\u0e34\u0e19}}), [[Water Margin]] or ''S\u00f2ngji\u0101ng'' ({{lang-th|\u0e0b\u0e49\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e01\u0e31\u0e4b\u0e07}}). These long prose works became a gold standard of Thai classical prose composition.\n\n===King Rama II: poet king of Thailand===\n[[file:Buddha Loetla Nabhalai portrait.jpg|thumb|right|150px|King Buddha Loetla Nabhalai]]\n\nKing [[Rama II of Siam|Phra Phutthaloetla Naphalai]], also known as King Rama II of Siam (r. 1809-1824), was a gifted poet and playwright and is also a great patron of artists. His reign was known as the \"golden age of Rattanakosin literature\". His literary salon was responsible for reviving and repairing many important works of literature which were damaged or lost during the sack of Ayutthaya. Poets, including ''[[Sunthorn Phu]]'', thrived under his patronage. King Loetlanaphalai was himself a poet and artist. He is generally ranked second <!--by whom?-->only to Sunthorn Phu in terms of poetic brilliance. As a young prince, he took part in recomposing the missing or damaged parts of Thai literary masterpieces, including ''[[Ramakien]]'' and ''[[Khun Chang Khun Phaen]]''. He later wrote and popularized many plays, based on folk stories or old plays that survived the destruction of the old capital, including:\n* ''[[Panji (prince)|Inao]]'' ({{lang-th|\u0e2d\u0e34\u0e40\u0e2b\u0e19\u0e32}})\n* ''[[Krai Thong]]'' ({{lang-th|\u0e44\u0e01\u0e23\u0e17\u0e2d\u0e07}}): a [[Thai folklore|Thai folktale]], originating from [[Phichit Province]]. It tells the story of Chalawan (\u0e0a\u0e32\u0e25\u0e27\u0e31\u0e19), a crocodile lord who abducts a daughter of a wealthy Phichit man, and Kraithong, a merchant from [[Nonthaburi (city)|Nonthaburi]] who seeks to rescue the girl and must challenge Chalawan.

Sunthorn Phu is best known for his epic poem ''[[Phra Aphai Mani]]'' ({{lang-th|\u0e1e\u0e23\u0e30\u0e2d\u0e20\u0e31\u0e22\u0e21\u0e13\u0e35}}), which he started in 1822 (while in jail) and finished in 1844. ''Phra Aphai Mani'' is a versified fantasy-adventure novel, a genre of Siamese literature known as ''nithan kham klon'' ({{lang-th|\u0e19\u0e34\u0e17\u0e32\u0e19\u0e04\u0e33\u0e01\u0e25\u0e2d\u0e19}}). It relates the adventures of the eponymous protagonist, Prince Aphai Mani, who is trained in the art of music such that the songs of his flute tame and disarm men, beasts, and gods. At the beginning of the story, Phra Aphai and his brother are banished from their kingdom because the young prince chooses to study music rather than to be a warrior. While in exile, Phra Aphai is kidnapped by a female [[Titan (mythology)|Titan]] (or an [[ogress]]) named ''Pii Sue Samut'' ('sea butterfly'; {{lang-th|\u0e1c\u0e35\u0e40\u0e2a\u0e37\u0e49\u0e2d\u0e2a\u0e21\u0e38\u0e17\u0e23}}) who falls in love with him after she hears his flute music. Longing to return home, Phra Aphai manages to escape the ogress with the help of a beautiful mermaid. He fathers two sons, one with the ogress and another with the mermaid, who later grow up to be heroes with superhuman powers. Phra Aphai slays Pii Sue Samut (the ogress) with the song of his flute and continues his voyage; he suffers more shipwrecks, is rescued, and then falls in love with a princess named Suwanmali. A duel breaks out between Phra Aphai and Prince Ussaren, Suwanmali's fianc\u00e9, with the maiden's hand as the prize. Phra Aphai slays his rival. ''Nang Laweng'', Ussaren's sister and queen of Lanka (Ceylon), vows revenge. She bewitches rulers of other nations with her peerless beauty and persuades them to raise a great coalition army to avenge her fallen brother. Phra Aphai, too, is bewitched by Nang Laweng's beauty. Nevertheless, he confronts Nang Laweng and they fall in love. The war and various troubles continue, but Phra Aphai and his sons prevail in the end. He appoints his sons as rulers of the cities he has won. Now tired of love and war, Phra Aphai abdicates the throne and retires to the forest with two of his wives to become ascetics.\n\n====Composition and versions====\nThe epic tale of ''Phra Aphai Mani'' is a massive work of poetry in ''klon suphap'' ({{lang-th|\u0e01\u0e25\u0e2d\u0e19\u0e2a\u0e38\u0e20\u0e32\u0e1e}}).

Sunthorn Phu, however, originally intended to end the story at the point where Phra Aphai abdicates the throne and withdraws. This leaves his original vision of the work at 25,098 b\u0101t (two line couplet) of poetry, 64 ''samut thai'' books. But Sunthorn Phu's literary patron wanted him to continue composing, which he did for many years. Today, the abridged version, i.e., his original 64 [[samut khoi|samut-thai]] volumes, or 25,098 couplets of poetry\u2014is regarded as the authoritative text of the epic.<ref name=#1/> It took Sunthorn Phu more than 20 years to compose (from c. 1822 or 1823 to 1844).\n\n''Phra Aphai Mani'' is Sunthorn Phu's [[masterpiece|chef-d'\u0153uvre]]. It breaks the literary tradition of earlier Thai poetic novels or ''nithan kham-klon'' ({{lang-th|\u0e19\u0e34\u0e17\u0e32\u0e19\u0e04\u0e33\u0e01\u0e25\u0e2d\u0e19}}) by including Western mythical creatures, such as mermaids, and contemporary inventions, such as [[Steamboat|steam-powered ships]] ({{lang-th|\u0e2a\u0e33\u0e40\u0e20\u0e32\u0e22\u0e19\u0e15\u0e4c}}) which only started to appear in Europe in the early-1800s. Sunthorn Phu also writes about a mechanical music player at the time when a [[phonograph|gramophone]] or a [[player piano|self-playing piano]] was yet to be invented. This made ''Phra Aphai Mani'' surprisingly futuristic for the time. Also, unlike other classical Thai epic poems, ''Phra Aphai Mani'' depicts various exploits of white mercenaries and pirates which reflects the ongoing colonization of Southeast Asia in the early-19th century. Phra Aphai himself is said to have learned \"to speak ''farang'' (European), Chinese, and Cham languages.\" Moreover, the locations of cities and islands in ''Phra Aphai Mani'' are not imagined but actually correspond to real geographical locations in the [[Andaman Sea]] as well as east of the [[Indian Ocean]]. Sunthorn Phu could also give an accurate description of modern sea voyage in that part of the world. This suggests that the Sunthorn Phu must have acquired this knowledge from foreign seafarers first-hand. The multi-cultural and the half-mythical, half-realistic setting of ''Phra Aphai Mani'' combined with Sunthorn Phu's poetic power, makes ''Phra Aphai Mani'' a masterpiece.<!-- according to whom? -->\n\n====Sunthorn Phu as the poet of two worlds====\nWestern colonialism was spreading into Southeast Asia when Sunthorn Phu was composing ''Phra Aphai Mani''. Many Thai literary critics have thus suggested that Sunthorn Phu may have intended his epic masterpiece to be an [[anti-colonialism]] story, disguised as a versified tale of fantasy adventures.<ref name=#2>{{cite web|url=http://www.sujitwongthes.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/06/stp50-115.pdf|title= \u0e1e\u0e23\u0e30\u0e2d\u0e20\u0e31\u0e22\u0e21\u0e13\u0e35\u0e27\u0e23\u0e23\u0e13\u0e04\u0e14\u0e35\u0e01\u0e32\u0e23\u0e40\u0e21\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e07 \u0e15\u0e48\u0e2d\u0e15\u0e49\u0e32\u0e19\u0e01\u0e32\u0e23\u0e25\u0e48\u0e32\u0e40\u0e21\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e02\u0e36\u0e49\u0e19|work=\u0e2a\u0e38\u0e08\u0e34\u0e15\u0e15\u0e4c \u0e27\u0e07\u0e29\u0e4c\u0e40\u0e17\u0e28}}</ref> [[Sujit Wongthes]], for example, proposes that Sunthorn Phu models ''Nang Laweng'', Phra Aphai's beautiful blonde female nemesis who later becomes his lover, after [[Queen Victoria]] of England.<ref name=#2/> He cites the fact that Sunthorn Phu portrays an English captain of a [[privateer]] (pirate ship) as a villainous character to support his theory.<ref name=#2/> In a literary sense, however, ''Phra Aphai Mani'' could perhaps be inspired by [[Ancient Greek literature#Epic poetry|Greek epic]]s and Persian literature, notably the [[Iliad]], the [[Odyssey]], the [[Argonauts]], and [[Thousand and One Nights]]. The structure of ''Phra Aphai Mani'' conforms to the [[monomyth]] structure, shared by other great epic stories. It is possible that Sunthorn Phu may have learned these epic stories from European missionaries, Catholic priests, or learned individuals who travelled to Siam during the early-19th century. Phra Aphai, the protagonist, resembles [[Orpheus]]\u2014the famed musician of the [[Argonauts]]\u2014rather than a warrior like [[Achilles]]. Moreover, Phra Aphai's odyssean journey conjures similarity with the [[Odysseus|King of Ithaca]]. ''Pii Sue Samut'' (\"the sea butterfly\"), a love-struck female titan who kidnaps the hero, reminds us of the nymph [[Calypso (mythology)|Calypso]]. Also, much like Odysseus, Phra Aphai's long voyage enables him to speak many languages and to discern the minds and customs of many foreign races. Phra Aphai's name ({{lang-th|\u0e2d\u0e20\u0e31\u0e22}}: 'to forgive') is pronounced quite similar to how \"[[Orpheus]]\" ({{lang-gr|\u1f48\u03c1\u03c6\u03b5\u03cd\u03c2}}) is pronounced in Greek. In addition, Nang Laweng's bewitching beauty, so captivating it drives nations to war, seems to match the reputation of [[Helen of Troy]]. Others have suggested that ''Nang Laweng'' may have been inspired by a story of a Christian princess, told in Persia's ''[[Thousand and One Nights]]'', who falls in love with a Muslim king.\n\nAll of this suggests that Sunthorn Phu was a Siamese bard with a bright and curious mind who absorbed, not only the knowledge of contemporary seafaring and Western inventions, but also stories of Greek classical epics from learned Europeans. In composing ''Phra Aphai Mani'', Sunthorn Phu demonstrates a grand poetic ambition. He becomes the first Thai writer to draw inspirations from Western literary sources and produces an epic based, loosely, on the amalgamation of those myths and legends. Thus, rather than writing with a political motive, Sunthorn Phu might simply have wanted to challenge the best poets and literature of the West.\n\n====Sunthorn Phu's other literary legacy====\n[[file:Sunthornphu_monument.jpg|right|thumb|230px|A sculpture of [[Sunthorn Phu]] near his birthplace in Rayong Province]]\n\nSunthorn Phu is also the master of the Siamese tradition of parting-and-longing poetry or ''[[nirat]]'' which was popular among Thai poets who journeyed away from loved ones. Sunthorn Phu composed many nirat poems, probably from 1807 when he was on a trip to Mueang Klaeng (\u0e40\u0e21\u0e37\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e41\u0e01\u0e25\u0e07), a town between [[Rayong]] (his hometown) and [[Chanthaburi]]. There are many forms of \"travel\" or parting-and-longing poetry in the Thai language. In the Ayutthaya period, these were composed by noblemen (such as Prince Thammathibet (1715-1756)), whose sentimentality and expressions were refined and formal. Sunthorn Phu was different because he was a common man and his poetry is more fun (\u0e2a\u0e19\u0e38\u0e01), catchy, and humorous.{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}} Sunthorn Phu was probably not as classically trained as other Thai famous poets (who were often members of the royal family) in the past. Nidhi Eoseewong, a Thai historian, argues that Sunthorn Phu's success can be attributable to the rise of the [[bourgeoisie]] or the middle class audience\u2014following the transformation of Siam from a feudal society to a market economy\u2014who held different values and had different tastes from aristocrats.<ref>{{cite book|last=\u0e27\u0e07\u0e29\u0e4c\u0e40\u0e17\u0e28|first=\u0e2a\u0e38\u0e08\u0e34\u0e15\u0e15\u0e4c|title=\u0e23\u0e33\u0e1e\u0e31\u0e19\u0e1e\u0e34\u0e25\u0e32\u0e1b\u0e02\u0e2d\u0e07\u0e2a\u0e38\u0e19\u0e17\u0e23\u0e20\u0e39\u0e48|publisher=\u0e21\u0e2b\u0e32\u0e27\u0e34\u0e17\u0e22\u0e32\u0e25\u0e31\u0e22\u0e28\u0e34\u0e25\u0e1b\u0e32\u0e01\u0e23|year=2006|pages=67\u201371}}</ref>\n \nSunthorn Phu was therefore, like Shakespeare, a people's poet. Instead of exclusively writing to please aristocratic institutions or patrons, Sunthorn Phu also writes both to entertain and to instruct, which shows his confidence in his personal mission as a poet. His works were thus popular among common Siamese, and he was prolific enough to make a living from it. Sunthorn Phu exercised his \"copyright\" by allowing people to make copies of his ''nithan'' poems ({{lang-th|\u0e19\u0e34\u0e17\u0e32\u0e19\u0e04\u0e33\u0e01\u0e25\u0e2d\u0e19}}), such as ''Phra Aphai Mani'', for a fee.<ref>Damrong Rajanubhab (1975), Life and Works of Sunthorn Phu (Thai)</ref> This made Sunthorn Phu one of the first Thais to ever earn a living as an [[author]]. Although a bard of the royal court, he was disdained by many genteel and noble-born poets for appealing to the common people.{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\nSunthorn Phu was a prolific poet. Many of Sunthorn Phu's works were lost or destroyed due to his sojourn lifestyle. However, much is still extant.

Based on the tragic end of King Phra Lo, who died together with the two women he loved, Phra Phuean and Phra Phaeng, the daughters of the ruler of the [[Song District|city of Song]], it originated in a tale of [[Thai folklore]] and later became part of Thai literature.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110812204735/http://www.identity.opm.go.th/identity/doc/nis00854.PDF Thai Literature]</ref>\n\nTwentieth century Thai writers tended to produce light fiction rather than literature.

Most evident were the ''[[Yadu (poetry)|yadu]]'' or ''yatu'' ({{my|\u101b\u102c\u1010\u102f}}), an emotional and philosophic verse, and the ''[[yagan]]'' ({{my|\u101b\u102c\u1000\u1014\u103a}}) genre. The next transmission of Thai literary influence to Burma happened in the aftermath of the fall of Ayutthaya Kingdom in 1767. After a second  conquest of [[Ayutthaya Kingdom|Ayutthaya]] (Thailand), many Siamese royal dancers and poets were brought back to the court of [[Konbaung Dynasty|Konbaung]]. Ramakien, the Thai version of ''[[Ramayana]]'' ({{my|\u101b\u102c\u1019\u101a\u1014}}) was introduced and was adapted in Burmese where it is now called [[Yama Zatdaw]]. Many dramatic songs and poems were transliterated directly from the Thai language. In addition, the Burmese also adopted the Thai tradition of ''[[Nirat]]'' poetry, which became popular among the Burmese royal class. Burmese literature during this period was therefore modeled after the ''Ramayana'', and dramatic plays were patronised by the Burmese court.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://goldenlandpages.com/hotspots/rama/rama.htm|title=Ramayana in Myanmar's Heart|accessdate=5 September 2006|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061029183721/http://www.goldenlandpages.com/hotspots/rama/rama.htm|archivedate=29 October 2006}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Map of the Rattanakosin Kingdom.svg|thumb|right|180px|The early [[Rattanakosin Kingdom]] and its political and cultural hegemony (1809)]]\n\nCambodia had fallen under Siamese hegemony in the reign of [[Naresuan|King Naresuan]]. But it was during the [[Thonburi Kingdom]] that the high cultures of the Rattanakosin kingdom were systematically transmitted to a Cambodian court that absorbed them voraciously. As F\u00e9d\u00e9ric Maurel, a French historian, notes:\n\n{{quote|From the close of the eighteenth century and through the nineteenth century, a number of Khmer pages, classical women dancers, and musicians studied with Thai ajarn (masters or teachers) in Cambodia. The presence of this Thai elite in Cambodia contributed to the development of strong Thai cultural influence among the Khmer upper classes. Moreover, some members of the Khmer royal family went to the Thai court and developed close relations with well-educated Thai nobility, as well as several court poets. Such cultural links were so powerful that, in some fields, one might use the term ''Siamization'' in referring to the processes of cultural absorption at the Khmer court at that time.{{sfn|Maurel|2002|p=100}}}}\n       \nIt was during this period of Siamzation that Thai literary influence had a wholesale impact on Khmer literature. The ''Nirat'' or Siamese tradition of parting poetry was emulated by Khmer poets; and many Thai stories were translated directly from the Siamese source into Khmer language.{{sfn|Maurel|2002|p=100}}\n\nOne Thai study on comparative literature found that Cambodia's current version of Ramayana (Reamker) was translated directly from the Thai source, stanza by stanza.<ref name=\"Pakdeek-2009\">{{cite journal|last=Pakdeekham|first=Santi|title=Relationships between early Thai and Khmer plays|journal=Damrong Journal|number=1|volume=8|year=2009|page=56|url=http://www.damrong-journal.su.ac.th/?article_id=347&page=view_article}}</ref> The Cambodian royal court used to stage Thai ''lakhon'' dramas in Thai language during King [[Norodom of Cambodia|Narodom]]'s reign.<ref name=\"Pakdeek-2009\" />{{RP|54}} While older [[Reamker]] literary texts may have existed before the 16th century but most of the work has now been lost.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Marrison|first=G.

French Guiana is therefore not eligible to enter the [[Football World Cup|World Cup]], but French Guianans are eligible to play for the [[French national football team]], as they are French citizens. [[Bernard Lama]] and [[Florent Malouda]] are two examples of Guianese players who have played for the French national team, the former winning the [[1998 FIFA World Cup|1998 World Cup]] and [[UEFA Euro 2000]] and the latter playing as a runner-up during the [[2006 FIFA World Cup|2006 World Cup]].\n\nHowever, [[French Guiana]] is a member of [[CONCACAF]] and [[Caribbean Football Union|CFU]], and thus eligible for all competitions organized by both. Indeed, according to the status of the FFF (article 34, paragraph 6): ''\"[...]Under the control of related continental confederations, and with the agreement of the FFF, those leagues can organize international sport events at a regional level or set up teams in order to participate to them.\"''\n\n==Gold Cup record==\n{{main|French Guiana at the CONCACAF Gold Cup}}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"

3\u20130 win against French Guiana as a result of French Guiana fielding the ineligible player Florent Malouda, after the match had finished 0\u20130. Malouda previously had 80 caps with France and did not meet eligibility rules. French Guiana were also fined, and Malouda was banned for 2 CONCACAF Gold Cup matches.\n\n==Current squad==\n{{update|date=June 2019}}\nThe following is the 23-man squad for the [[2019-20 CONCACAF
