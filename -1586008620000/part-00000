Refusing to replenish its membership with soldiers who had not fought in the [[Argentine War of Independence]], the regiment disbanded in 1826.\n\nThe second Regiment of Mounted Grenadiers was formed in 1903, and serves as the national ceremonial unit. It claims the original regiment of 1812 as its heritage, but has no direct link or lineage. This incarnation of the regiment is also known as the ''General Jose de San Martin Cavalry Regiment''. As a unit, it has never been in combat, although ten members of the regiment were seconded to other units which fought in the Falklands, as well as six machine gun detachments being attached to the [[Regiment of Patricians|'''1st Infantry Regiment''' ''Los Patricios'']] during that conflict.\n\n==The original Mounted Grenadiers of 1812\u20131826==\nThe original regiment was founded by Argentine national hero [[Jos\u00e9 de San Mart\u00edn]] in 1812. Its first military action was the [[Battle of San Lorenzo]] (1813). The regiment also played a key role as part of the [[Army of the Andes]] (''Ej\u00e9rcito de los Andes'') in the battles of [[battle of Chacabuco|Chacabuco]] (1817) and [[Battle of Maip\u00fa|Maip\u00fa]] (1818) in Chile. Traveling to Per\u00fa, Ecuador, and Bolivia, the Grenadiers took part in the Battles of [[Battle of Riobamba|Riobamba]], [[Battle of Pichincha|Pichincha]] (1822) and [[Battle of Ayacucho|Ayacucho]] (1824), and in the Cisplatine War. The size of the regiment fell to 120 men and it was disbanded in 1827.\n\n===Raising of the Regiment===\nWhen then Lt. Col. of Cavalry Jose de San Martin arrived on March 9, 1812, the [[First Triumvirate (Argentina)|First Triumvirate]] recognized him for his services as a [[Cavalry]] officer in the [[Spanish Army]]. After studying the Argentine Army's organizational and strategic problems, he offered to put his experiences from the [[Peninsular War]] to use in assisting with the Argentine War for Independence.\n\nOn March 12, the Superior Provisional Government gave an order that recognized and confirmed San Martin's services. The Triumvirate had written to the government asking that San Martin be appointed commander of the Mounted Grenadiers Squadron, which was about to be raised. San Martin set out to form a new cavalry corps that would be patterned after the Swiss Army's Mounted Grenadiers. His goal was to create a unit made up of native soldiers trained in cavalry tactics and mounted combat skills that could effectively support the Argentine Army. Over the next several months, he built what became known as the \"Mounted Grenadiers Squadron\".\n\n===Composition of the Horse Grenadiers Squadron (June 1812)===\nThe new unit was led by two commanders and eight ''officers of cavalry''. Non-commissioned officers and enlisted troops numbered nine cavalry [[sergeant]]s, three cavalry [[corporal]]s, 31 cavalry [[grenadier]]s and one cavalry trumpeter.\n\n'''Officers and commanders of the Squadron'''\n* [[Squadron (army)|Squadron]] [[Commander]]: [[Lieutenant Colonel]] Jose de San Martin\n* Squadron Corporal Major: [[Carlos Maria de Alvear]]\n* [[Adjutant]] Major: Francisco Luzuriaga\n* Guidon Bearer: Manuel Hidalgo\n\n'''1st Cavalry Troop officers'''\n* Cavalry Captain Jose Matias Zapiola\n* Cavalry Lieutenant Justo Bermudez\n* [[Cornet (military rank)|Cornet]] Hipolito Bouchard\n\n'''2nd Cavalry Troop officers'''\n* Cavalry Captain Pedro Vergara\n* Cavalry Lieutenant Agenor Murillio\n* Cornet [[Mariano Necochea]]\n\n===Organization and recruiting===\nThe strict training regimen and rules of conduct established by Jose de San Martin for the Mounted Grenadiers Regiment became a model for the Argentine Army. Rigorous military discipline, especially in maneuvers, training and parade drills were a defining characteristic of the regiment. The ''San Martin Code of Honor'', still used today by the regiment, set out the rules expected to be followed by each member of the Mounted Grenadiers. San Martin used the Code of Honor in recruiting, training, and leading what became an effective fighting force.\n\nBased on the concept of \"leading by example\", in private life as well as military life, the Regiment's Code of Honor included discipline, courage, and a commitment to training. The Code incorporated fourteen specific points, which stated that it was unbecoming of an officer in the regiment:\n#To show cowardice in battle. Even lowering one's head will be considered as such.\n#To not accept a challenge, whether it is just or unjust.\n#To not demand satisfaction when he has been insulted.\n#To not defend, at all costs, the honor of his unit when it has been defamed in his presence or elsewhere.\n#To cheat like a tradesman.\n#To lack integrity in the management of his unit's interests; such as not paying his troops the money that has been provided for them.\n#To speak ill of his comrades to soldiers or officers from other military units.\n#To publicize the discussions held by the officers in their secret meetings.\n#To fraternize with sergeants, corporals and troopers.\n#To lay hands on a woman, even if she has insulted him.\n#To not come to the relief of a comrade who is in danger, when he is able.\n#To be seen in public with women who are known prostitutes.\n#To gamble with low and bawdy people outside of the officer corps.\n#To drink immoderately, in a way that would be prejudicial to the honor of his unit.\n\nSometime later, San Mart\u00edn wrote a short poem honoring his Grenadiers:\n{{Col-begin}}\n{{Col-break}}\n<poem>\n''De lo que mis Granaderos son capaces,''\n''solo lo s\u00e9 yo.''\n''Quien los iguale habr\u00e1;''\n''quien los exceda, no.''\n</poem>\n{{Col-break}}\n<poem>\n''Of what my Grenadiers are capable,''\n''Only I know.''\n''Who can equal them there will be;''\n''Who can exceed them, not.''\n</poem>\n{{col-end}}\n\n===Development from squadron to regiment===\nAfter a period of recruitment and training, the Second Mounted Grenadiers Squadron was decreed as ready on September 11, 1812, and the Third Mounted Grenadiers Squadron followed in December 1812. By this time, the First Triumvirate had been disbanded as a result of the [[Revolution of October 8, 1812]], which had been supported by the Second Squadron.\n\nSan Martin was given the title of ''Commander of the Mounted Grenadiers''. When the '''Mounted Grenadiers Regiment''' officially came into existence on December 7, 1812, San Martin was promoted to [[Colonel]] and the unit relocated to improved quarters and better stables. Its Fourth Squadron was raised three years later, in 1815.\n\n=== Baptism by fire: the Battle of San Lorenzo (February 3, 1813) ===\n{{Main|Battle of San Lorenzo}}\n\nOn February 3, 1813, the regiment won the only battle of the Argentine War of Independence led by San Martin. The regiment had proceeded to the town of San Lorenzo in Santa Fe on the previous day to stop an advance landing party of 250 Spanish troops from marching on the capital. The regiment was joined by a militia company led by Celedonio Escalada. Setting up camp at a convent in the town, they remained overnight.\n\nAt dawn the next day, the regiment assembled in front of the convent. San Martin mounted, addressed the troops, and ordered his squadrons to set off in two 60-man columns. San Martin led one column; Captain Justo Bermudez, from Uruguay, led the other. The 12 remaining men from the regiment formed a reserve platoon.\n\nSan Martin's troops charged the Spanish battalion, followed by Bermudez bringing up a second charge. San Martin fell from his horse after it was wounded, but was rescued by [[Juan Bautista Cabral]] and [[Juan Bautista Baigorria]], two men from his regiment. Cabral was mortally wounded in the process and San Mart\u00edn reported that Cabral's dying words (in Guarani) were: \"I die happy, we have defeated the enemy\". Moments later, Lieutenant Bouchard killed the Spanish flag bearer, completing the rout of the Spanish forces.\n\nThe battle lasted only 15 minutes, but left 40 Spanish dead and 16 wounded or captured, and 16 Argentine dead and 22 wounded. The Argentine force also seized two cannons.\n\nSan Martin ensured that the Spanish wounded and captured were treated humanely. After having breakfast with the Spanish commander, Antonio Zabala, on February 4, San Martin persuaded the Spanish force to defect to the Argentine cause.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} On his return, San Martin was congratulated by Eastern Bank independence leader Jos\u00e9 Gervasio Artigas on his first victory.\n\nThe Second Triumvirate promoted San Martin to General and gave him command of the Buenos Aires garrison forces.\n\n=== Eastern Bank and the [[Army of the North]] ===\nThe next assignment for the regiment was defense duties in an area that is modern day [[Montevideo]], [[Uruguay]] along with supporting the Army of the North. The First and Second Squadrons joined the Argentine army in Tucuman in January 1814, remaining in northern Upper Peru until 1816, while the Third and Fourth Squadrons were involved in the campaign of liberation in the Banda Oriental, becoming part of the forces that took the city in June 1814.\n\nIn their performance in the battles for Upper Peru, the 1st and 2nd Squadrons witnessed the events of the [[Yatasto relay]] within days after their arrival.\n\nOn August that same year, 1814, San Martin assumed the office of provincial governor of Cuyo Province fronting the Chilean border, and the Regiment set up its new home in the province the next year with the 3rd and 4th Squadrons moving there, followed in the next year by the 1st and 2nd Squadrons. Assisted by now Lieutenant Colonel Mariano Necochea, the regiment prepared itself for the liberation of Chile from Spanish rule and thus, together with the newly formed mounted rifle squadron with Necochea as its commanding officer, raised with 300 Horse Grenadiers, formed part of the [[Army of the Andes]] with San Martin himself as its commanding general. It rode towards the Chilean border as part of the [[Crossing of the Andes]] in the late summer of 1817, and upon reaching Chile, fought bravely in the [[Battle of Chacabuco]] in February, later distinguishing themselves the following year in the [[Second Battle of Cancha Rayada]] and the [[Battle of Maip\u00fa]]. The regiment, thus, was witness to the [[Chilean Declaration of Independence]] in Santiago on 12 February 1818, one year after the victory in the Chacabuco fields.\n\n==The Mounted Grenadiers of 1903\u2013today==\n[[File:Regimiento de Granaderos a Caballo (Mayor\u00eda).jpg|thumb|300px|Headquarters of the General San Mart\u00edn Regiment of Mounted Grenadiers, located in the [[Palermo, Buenos Aires|Palermo]] section of Buenos Aires. Built in [[Vienna Secession]] style in 1907, it was declared a National Historic Monument in 1997.]]\n\nIn 1903, the Regiment was reinstated and four years later was re-appointed as the Presidential Honor Guard.\n\nThe unit itself has never seen combat ever since, although during the [[Falklands War]] eight conscripts and two first corporals from the regiment were seconded to units in the Falklands and two were wounded in combat. An adhoc troop from the regiment, originally planned for deployment, was placed on reserve in the mainland. Six [[M2 Browning#Users|machine gun]] detachments did see service in the Falklands, being attached to the [[Regiment of Patricians|1st Infantry Regiment]].\n\n===Role===\nAt present, the regiment acts as the Presidential Honor Guard regiment and fulfills ceremonial protocol functions. It is the caretaker of the [[Casa Rosada]], the Argentine Presidential Palace at the eastern end of the famous [[Plaza de Mayo]]. The regiment also takes on ceremonial and security duties at the various residences of the [[President of Argentina]] nationwide.\n\nThe Regiment also mounts guard at the [[Buenos Aires Metropolitan Cathedral]], where its founder's remains are buried, and at the [[Palace of the Argentine National Congress]].\n\n== Structure ==\n{{expand section|date=January 2014}}\n\n=== Organization ===\n*Regimental HQ\n*Alto Peru Fanfare Brass Band\n*Mounted Ceremonial Squadron\n** San Lorenzo Troop\n** Maipo Troop\n** Junin Troop\n** Riobamba Troop\n* Security and Escort Squadron (Dismounted)\n** Ayacucho Troop\n** Chacabuco Troop\n** Montevideo Troop (Training)\n\n===Full [[dress uniform]] and ceremonial weapons===\n[[File:Member of the Regimiento de Granaderos a Caballo General San Mart\u00edn.jpg|thumb|Member of the Regimiento de Granaderos in red uniform]]\n''Officers''\n* Blue [[Shako]] with a Red/Blue [[Pompom]]\n* Blue polo dress/battle uniform and pants\n** Gold Grenade [[badge]]\n** 9 gold [[Button]]s \n** [[Epaulette]] (blue with red piping)\n* Black Leather [[Boot|boots]]\n* Cavalry [[sabre]] belt\n* Cavalry sabre with [[scabbard]]\n\n''Enlisted and NCOs''\n* Red Shako with a Violet pompom\n* Blue polo uniform with gold buttons and a Yellow grenade badge and pants\n** Epaulette (scarlet with red piping)\n* Black leather boots\n* Sabres with scabbards, cavalry [[Carbine]]s (optional), [[lance]]s\n\n===Alto Peru Mounted Fanfare Band===\n[[File:Cambio de Guardia 2.jpg|thumb|Alto Peru Mounted Fanfare Band]]\nEstablished in 1929 as the musical support unit of the Mounted Grenadiers Regiment, this is one of the many military bands in the service of the Argentine Army, and one of the Army's few cavalry mounted bands. Like the bands of the British Army's [[Royal Armoured Corps]] and Household Cavalry, and the French Army's Cavalry Branch and the French National Gendarmerie's Republican Guard Cavalry Regiment, the band plays as both a regular military brass band and a mounted band.\n\nWhen mounted on horseback, the band features trumpets, helicons, tubas, euphoniums, baritones, trombones, 1 [[wagner tuba]], 1 flugelhorn, 4 timpani and 1 glockenspiel, and is led by the two Bandleaders with their batons. When performing on the ground, the band features trumpets, valve trombones, mellophones, tubas, baritones, euphoniums, 1 wagner tuba, 1 flugelhorn, 1 snare drum, 1-2 bass drums, cymbals, 1 glockenspiel, and field snare drums (formerly with the bugles or trumpets), and is led by the Bandleaders and a Drum Major (when mounted he serves as the Band Trumpet Major, who serves as the senior trumpeter).\n\n\n==Other known equipment==\n[[File:Cristina Kirchner deposit\u00f3 el sable corvo de San Mart\u00edn en el Museo Hist\u00f3rico Nacional -

Moments later, Lieutenant Bouchard killed the Spanish flag bearer, completing the rout of the Spanish forces.\n\nThe battle lasted only 15 minutes, but left 40 Spanish dead and 16 wounded or captured, and 16 Argentine dead and 22 wounded. The Argentine force also seized two cannons.\n\nSan Martin ensured that the Spanish wounded and captured were treated humanely. After having breakfast with the Spanish commander, Antonio Zabala, on February 4, San Martin persuaded the Spanish force to defect to the Argentine cause.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} On his return, San Martin was congratulated by Eastern Bank independence leader Jos\u00e9 Gervasio Artigas on his first victory.\n\nThe Second Triumvirate promoted San Martin to General and gave him command of the Buenos Aires garrison forces.\n\n=== Eastern Bank and the [[Army of the North]] ===\nThe next assignment for the regiment was defense duties in an area that is modern day [[Montevideo]], [[Uruguay]] along with supporting the Army of the North. The First and Second Squadrons joined the Argentine army in Tucuman in January 1814, remaining in northern Upper Peru until 1816, while the Third and Fourth Squadrons were involved in the campaign of liberation in the Banda Oriental, becoming part of the forces that took the city in June 1814.\n\nIn their performance in the battles for Upper Peru, the 1st and 2nd Squadrons witnessed the events of the [[Yatasto relay]] within days after their arrival.\n\nOn August that same year, 1814, San Martin assumed the office of provincial governor of Cuyo Province fronting the Chilean border, and the Regiment set up its new home in the province the next year with the 3rd and 4th Squadrons moving there, followed in the next year by the 1st and 2nd Squadrons. Assisted by now Lieutenant Colonel Mariano Necochea, the regiment prepared itself for the liberation of Chile from Spanish rule and thus, together with the newly formed mounted rifle squadron with Necochea as its commanding officer, raised with 300 Horse Grenadiers, formed part of the [[Army of the Andes]] with San Martin himself as its commanding general. It rode towards the Chilean border as part of the [[Crossing of the Andes]] in the late summer of 1817, and upon reaching Chile, fought bravely in the [[Battle of Chacabuco]] in February, later distinguishing themselves the following year in the [[Second Battle of Cancha Rayada]] and the [[Battle of Maip\u00fa]]. The regiment, thus, was witness to the [[Chilean Declaration of Independence]] in Santiago on 12 February 1818, one year after the victory in the Chacabuco fields.\n\n==The Mounted Grenadiers of 1903\u2013today==\n[[File:Regimiento de Granaderos a Caballo (Mayor\u00eda).jpg|thumb|300px|Headquarters of the General San Mart\u00edn Regiment of Mounted Grenadiers, located in the [[Palermo, Buenos Aires|Palermo]] section of Buenos Aires. Built in [[Vienna Secession]] style in 1907, it was declared a National Historic Monument in 1997.]]\n\nIn 1903, the Regiment was reinstated and four years later was re-appointed as the Presidential Honor Guard.\n\nThe unit itself has never seen combat ever since, although during the [[Falklands War]] eight conscripts and two first corporals from the regiment were seconded to units in the Falklands and two were wounded in combat. An adhoc troop from the regiment, originally planned for deployment, was placed on reserve in the mainland. Six [[M2 Browning#Users|machine gun]] detachments did see service in the Falklands, being attached to the [[Regiment of Patricians|1st Infantry Regiment]].\n\n===Role===\nAt present, the regiment acts as the Presidential Honor Guard regiment and fulfills ceremonial protocol functions. It is the caretaker of the [[Casa Rosada]], the Argentine Presidential Palace at the eastern end of the famous [[Plaza de Mayo]]. The regiment also takes on ceremonial and security duties at the various residences of the [[President of Argentina]] nationwide.\n\nThe Regiment also mounts guard at the [[Buenos Aires Metropolitan Cathedral]], where its founder's remains are buried, and at the [[Palace of the Argentine National Congress]].\n\n== Structure ==\n{{expand section|date=January 2014}}\n\n=== Organization ===\n*Regimental HQ\n*Alto Peru Fanfare Brass Band\n*Mounted Ceremonial Squadron\n** San Lorenzo Troop\n** Maipo Troop\n** Junin Troop\n** Riobamba Troop\n* Security and Escort Squadron (Dismounted)\n** Ayacucho Troop\n** Chacabuco Troop\n** Montevideo Troop (Training)\n\n===Full [[dress uniform]] and ceremonial weapons===\n[[File:Member of the Regimiento de Granaderos a Caballo General San Mart\u00edn.jpg|thumb|Member of the Regimiento de Granaderos in red uniform]]\n''Officers''\n* Blue [[Shako]] with a Red/Blue [[Pompom]]\n* Blue polo dress/battle uniform and pants\n** Gold Grenade [[badge]]\n** 9 gold [[Button]]s \n** [[Epaulette]] (blue with red piping)\n* Black Leather [[Boot|boots]]\n* Cavalry [[sabre]] belt\n* Cavalry sabre with [[scabbard]]\n\n''Enlisted and NCOs''\n* Red Shako with a Violet pompom\n* Blue polo uniform with gold buttons and a Yellow grenade badge and pants\n** Epaulette (scarlet with red piping)\n* Black leather boots\n* Sabres with scabbards, cavalry [[Carbine]]s (optional), [[lance]]s\n\n===Alto Peru Mounted Fanfare Band===\n[[File:Cambio de Guardia 2.jpg|thumb|Alto Peru Mounted Fanfare Band]]\nEstablished in 1929 as the musical support unit of the Mounted Grenadiers Regiment, this is one of the many military bands in the service of the Argentine Army, and one of the Army's few cavalry mounted bands.

The series stars [[Ed Flanders]], [[Norman Lloyd]] and [[William Daniels]] as teaching doctors at an aging, rundown [[Boston]] hospital who give interns a promising future in making critical medical and life decisions. The series was produced by [[MTM Enterprises]], which had success with a similar NBC series, the police drama ''[[Hill Street Blues]]'', during that same time. The series were often compared to each other for their use of ensemble casts and overlapping serialized storylines (an original ad for ''St. Elsewhere'' quoted a critic that called the series \"'Hill Street Blues' in a hospital\").\n\nRecognized for its gritty, realistic drama, ''St. Elsewhere'' gained a small yet loyal following (the series never ranked higher than 47th place in the yearly [[Nielsen ratings]]) over its six-season, 137-episode run; however, the series also found a strong audience in Nielsen's 18\u201349 age demographic, a young demo later known for a young, affluent audience that TV advertisers were eager to reach.<ref name=\"AVClub100\">{{cite web | url=https://tv.avclub.com/st-elsewhere-1798230318 | title=St. Elsewhere | author=Emily VanDerWerff | date=March 12, 2012 | access-date=June 10, 2019 | quote=Shows like St. Elsewhere, which pulled in a solid number of younger viewers\u2014indeed, a larger number of younger viewers than some shows in the top 30\u2014could be monetized in that fashion.

(The South End's Franklin Square House Apartments, formerly known as the St. James Hotel and located next to [[Franklin and Blackstone Squares]], stood in for the hospital in establishing shots, including the series' opening sequence.)<ref>[http://virtualglobetrotting.com/map/franklin-square-house-st-elsewhere/ Entry for Franklin Square House] on VirtualGlobetrotting.com</ref> The hospital's nickname, \"St. Elsewhere\", is a slang term used in the medical field to refer to lesser-equipped hospitals that serve patients turned away by more prestigious institutions; it is also used in medical academia to refer to teaching hospitals in general. \n\nIn the pilot episode, surgeon Dr. Mark Craig (William Daniels) informs his colleagues that the local Boston media had bestowed the derogatory nickname upon St. Eligius since they perceived the hospital as \"a dumping ground, a place you wouldn't want to send your mother-in-law.\" In fact, the hospital was so poorly regarded that its shrine to [[Saint Eligius]] was commonly defiled by the hospital's visitors ''and'' staff, and is passingly referred to by Dr. Wayne Fiscus as \"the [[patron saint]] of longshoremen and bowlers.\" Eligius is actually neither; he is patron saint of [[Numismatics|numismatists]], metalworkers, and horses.) According to the hospital's founder, Father Joseph McCabe, he named the hospital after the saint because his father, a cabinet maker, constantly prayed to St. Eligius. McCabe refers to Eligius as the patron saint of artisans.\n\nJust as in ''[[Hill Street Blues]]'', ''St. Elsewhere'' employed a large ensemble cast; a gritty, \"realistic\" visual style; and a multitude of interlocking serialized stories, many of which continued over the course of multiple episodes or seasons. In the same way ''Hill Street'' was regarded as a groundbreaking police drama, ''St. Elsewhere'' also broke new ground in medical dramas, creating a template that influenced ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]'', ''[[Chicago Hope]]'', and other later shows in the genre. ''St. Elsewhere'' portrayed the medical profession as an admirable but less-than-perfect endeavor; the St. Eligius staff, while mostly having good intentions in serving their patients, all had their own personal and professional problems, with the two often intertwining. The staff's problems, and those of their patients (some of whom didn't survive), were often contemporary in nature, with storylines involving [[breast cancer]], [[AIDS]], and addiction. Though the series dealt with serious issues of life, death, the medical profession, and the human effects of all three, a substantial number of comedic moments, inside jokes, and references to television history were included, as well as tender moments of humanity.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1982/11/16/arts/tv-nbc-s-stylish-st-elsewhere.html \"NBC's Stylish 'St. Elsewhere,'\"] review from ''The New York Times'', 11/16/1982</ref>\n\nThe producers for the series were [[Bruce Paltrow]], [[Mark Tinker]], [[John Masius]], [[Tom Fontana]], [[John Falsey]] and [[Abby Singer]]. Tinker, Masius, Fontana, and Paltrow wrote a number of episodes as well; other writers included [[John Tinker (producer)|John Tinker]], [[John Ford Noonan]], [[Charles H. Eglee]], [[Eric Overmyer]], [[Channing Gibson]], and [[Aram Saroyan]].\n[[Image:St Elsewhere.jpg|thumb|The cast of ''St. Elsewhere'' (season one)]]\nThe show's main and end title theme was composed by famed jazz musician and composer [[Dave Grusin]]. Noted film and TV composer [[J. A. C. Redford]] wrote the music for the series (except for the pilot, which was scored by Grusin). No soundtrack was ever released, but the theme was released in two different versions: the original TV mix and edit appeared on [[TVT Records]]' compilation ''Television's Greatest Hits, Vol. 3: 70s & 80s'', and Grusin recorded a full-length version for inclusion on his ''[[Night Lines (Dave Grusin album)|Night Lines]]'' album, released in 1983.\n\n==Main cast==\n{{main|List of St. Elsewhere characters}}\n\nAlong with established actors [[Ed Flanders]], [[Norman Lloyd]] and [[William Daniels]], ''St. Elsewhere's'' ensemble cast included [[David Morse (actor)|David Morse]], [[Alfre Woodard]], [[Bruce Greenwood]], [[Christina Pickles]], [[Kyle Secor]], [[Ed Begley, Jr.|Ed Begley Jr.]], [[Stephen Furst]], [[Howie Mandel]], [[Mark Harmon]], [[Denzel Washington]] and [[Helen Hunt]]. Notable guest stars include [[Tim Robbins]], whose first major role was in the series' first three episodes as domestic terrorist Andrew Reinhardt, and [[Doris Roberts]] and [[James Coco]], who both earned [[35th Primetime Emmy Awards|Emmy Awards]] for their season-one appearance as, respectively, a bag lady and her mentally challenged husband.\n\n{{Div col|colwidth=30em}}\n*[[Ed Flanders]] as Dr. Donald Westphall (1982\u20131987, recurring: 1987\u20131988)\n*[[David Birney]] as Dr. Ben Samuels (1982\u20131983)\n*[[G.W.

Some of those episodes included:\n\n===\"Qui Transtulit Sustinet\"===\n''Original air date: November 16, 1983''\n\nDr. Morrison learns of the death of his wife, Nina (with whom he had an argument midway through the previous episode, which was the last time he saw her alive), after slipping and hitting her head.  Nina's heart is donated to a heart transplant patient\u2014a patient of Dr. Craig. The poignant final scene of the episode finds Morrison entering the patient's room and, with a [[stethoscope]], hearing the patient's new heart\u2014Nina's heart\u2014steadily beating.\n\n===\"Cheers\"===\n''Original air date: March 27, 1985''\n\n''St. Elsewhere'' ended its 3rd season with this TV [[crossover episode|crossover]] that found Drs. Westphall, Auschlander, and Craig getting together at that other Boston TV institution, the namesake setting of the comedy series ''[[Cheers]]''.  The scene, which was filmed on the main ''Cheers'' soundstage (Stage 25 at the [[Paramount Studios]] lot) and not entirely done for laughs, finds the bar's hypochondriac know-it-all [[Cliff Clavin]], trying and failing to gain free medical advice from the doctors; Auschlander confronting his former accountant, [[Norm Peterson]]; and barmaid [[Carla Tortelli]] voicing her displeasure with the doctors regarding her stay in St. Eligius two years earlier for the birth of her baby.  The scene ends with Westphall announcing to his two colleagues that he has decided to leave St. Eligius and medicine, a short-lived departure, as he returned in the Season 4 premiere. \n\nIn \"E.R.,\" an episode at the end of season 4, a patient mentions an assault by a waitress who is likely Carla Tortelli.\n\n===\"Time Heals\"===\n''Original air date: February 19 and 20, 1986''\n\nThis two-part episode featured storylines that fleshed out the 50-year history of St. Eligius, each sequence taped in a different style (i.e. black-and-white for the 1930s setting, muted colors for the 1940s). The storylines included the hospital's 1936 founding by Fr. Joseph McCabe (played by [[Edward Herrmann]]), the arrivals of Dr. Auschlander and Nurse Rosenthal, the early struggles of Mark Craig and his relationship with his mentor (which mirrored Craig's later mentoring of Dr. Ehrlich), the death of Dr. Westphall's wife, and Dr. Morrison simultaneously dealing with an overdose patient, a knee injury, and the disappearance of his son.  ''[[TV Guide]]'' ranked \"Time Heals\" No. 44 on its 1997 list of [[TV Guide's 100 Greatest Episodes of All Time|\"100 Greatest Episodes of All Time\"]], calling the episode \"a masterwork of dramatic writing.\"<ref>{{cite journal |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |year=1997 |title=Special Collector's Issue: 100 Greatest Episodes of All Time |journal=[[TV Guide]] |volume= |issue=June 28\u2013July 4 |pages= }}</ref>\n\n===\"After Life\"===\n''Original air date: November 26, 1986''\n\nThis episode deals with the shooting of Dr. Wayne Fiscus, who is critically wounded while trying to capture fireflies in the park across from St. Eligius during a break from rounds. As the staff frantically try to save him, Fiscus ventures back-and-forth between Hell (where he meets former colleague, and rapist, Peter White); Purgatory; and Heaven, where he has a conversation with God, who presents Himself as a spitting image of Fiscus.  Just as Fiscus shakes hands with [[Lou Gehrig]], his colleagues successfully revive him back to Earth.\n\n===\"Last Dance at the Wrecker's Ball\"===\n''Original air date: May 27, 1987''\n\nIn the season-five finale, all attempts to save St. Eligius from closing seem to have failed. As demolition begins, a frail Dr. Auschlander, accidentally left in the hospital after a relapse, attempts to escape.\n\n===\"A Moon For the Misbegotten\"===\n''Original air date: September 30, 1987''\n\nSt. Eligius is saved (and any damage from the above-mentioned \"Wrecker's Ball\" repaired), but it falls under the new ownership of Ecumena Corporation, a national [[managed health care]] concern. (The use of \"Ecumena\" garnered some real-life controversy, as [[Humana]] thought the use of that name sounded too much like its own; the trademark-infringement lawsuit that ensued prompted [[NBC]] to begin airing post-episode disclaimers stating that Ecumena was indeed fictional,<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/02/arts/st-elsewhere-told-to-carry-disclaimer.html \"'St. Elsewhere' Told to Carry Disclaimer\"] from ''The New York Times'', October 2, 1987</ref> and to change the corporate name mid-season to \"Weigert.\"<ref>[http://articles.latimes.com/1987-12-13/entertainment/ca-28851_1_trademark-infringement \"St. Name Change\"] from ''The Los Angeles Times'', December 13, 1987</ref>) Ecumena's choice to head St. Eligius, Dr. John Gideon, mixed like oil and water with the St. Eligius staff, especially Dr. Westphall, who, in the final scene of this episode (and [[Ed Flanders]]'s last moment as a ''St. Elsewhere'' series regular), delivers his resignation \"in terms you can understand\"\u2014by dropping his pants and [[Mooning|exposing his bare buttocks]] to Gideon (\"You can kiss my ass, pal\"). This scene, which would normally be considered controversial, was preserved by NBC's censors as they did not consider Westphall's display to be erotic in nature.<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0707875/trivia?ref_=tt_trv_trv Source: \"St. Elsewhere: A Moon for the Misbegotten,\"] from IMDb.</ref>\n\n===\"Their Town\"===\n''Original air date: April 20, 1988''\n\nIn a somewhat change-of-pace episode, Drs. Craig and Novino, Ellen Craig, and Lizzie Westphall visit Donald and Tommy Westphall (Lizzie's father and brother, respectively), who appear to be enjoying the quiet life in small town [[New Hampshire]].  The episode features Dr. Westphall occasionally breaking the [[fourth wall]] and speaking directly to the viewer, a la the \"Stage Manager\" character in ''[[Our Town]]'' (the episode title and its location are nods to the [[Thornton Wilder]] play).\n\n===\"The Last One\"===\n[[File:TommyWestphall-TheLastOne-1988.jpg|right|thumb|Tommy holds the St. Eligius snow globe in the final moments of \"The Last One\".]]\n''Original air date: May 25, 1988''\n\n''St. Elsewhere''{{'}}s [[series finale]] features momentous changes for several main characters, including the departures of Drs. Fiscus and Morrison and the death of Dr. Auschlander, as well as the return of Dr. Westphall to an active leadership role at St. Eligius after Weigert agrees to sell the hospital back to the Boston archdiocese, as Dr. Gideon is set to move on to another hospital in San Jose, California. The finale is more known for its provocative final scene: Westphall and his son [[Tommy Westphall]] (played by [[Chad Allen (actor)|Chad Allen]]), who has [[autism]], are seen in Dr. Auschlander's office watching snow falling outside. The image cuts to an exterior shot of the hospital. At that moment, Tommy and Daniel Auschlander are seen in an apartment building, with Tommy playing with a snow globe. Donald arrives home from a day of work, and it is clear from the uniform he wears and the dialog in this scene that he works in construction. \"Auschlander\" is revealed to be Donald's father, and thus Tommy's grandfather. Donald laments to his father, \"I don't understand this autism thing, Pop. Here's my son. I talk to him. I don't even know if he can hear me, because he sits there, all day long, in his own world, staring at that toy. What's he thinking about?\" As Tommy shakes the snow globe, he is told by his father to come and wash his hands for dinner. Donald places the snow globe on the family's television set and walks into the kitchen with Tommy and Auschlander; as they leave the room, the camera closes in on the snow globe\u2014which holds a replica of St. Eligius.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvacres.com/signoffs_finales_elsewhere.htm|title=TV ACRES: Quotations > Signoffs > Classic Series Finales > St. Elsewhere|access-date=August 9, 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120913144744/http://www.tvacres.com/signoffs_finales_elsewhere.htm|archive-date=September 13, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe most common interpretation of this scene is that the entire series of events in the series ''St. Elsewhere'' had been a product of Tommy Westphall's imagination, with elements of the above scene used as its own evidence.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/2951086.stm | work=BBC News | title=TV's strangest endings | date=May 30, 2003 | access-date=May 24, 2010 | first=William | last=Gallagher}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=CSTB&p_theme=cstb&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EB36DD7B6BEB6B7&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM | title=Chicago Sun-Times:: Search | date=May 26, 1988 | work=Chicago Sun-Times | first=Robert | last=Feder}}</ref> Author Cynthia Burkhead explains that with this final shot, \"St. Elsewhere managed to take the idea of a dream and alter it just enough, putting it in the imagination of an autistic boy\", and surmises that an ending constructed in this manner \"reminds viewers that the fiction they have watched for six years is actually fiction within a fiction, occupying a second level of unreality, one level beyond the space of illusion filled by all narrative television.\"<ref>{{cite thesis|last1=Burkhead|first1=Cynthia A.|title=Dancing Dwarfs and Talking Fish: The Narrative Functions of Television Dreams|date=December 2010|publisher=[[Middle Tennessee State University]]|id=No.3459290{{ProQuest|873898276}}|degree=Ph.D.|location=Murfreesboro, TN|page=157}}</ref> A notable result of this ending has been the attempt by individuals to determine how many television shows are also products of Tommy Westphall's mind owing to its [[Fictional crossover|shared fictional characters]] (the \"[[Tommy Westphall#The Tommy Westphall Universe Hypothesis|Tommy Westphall Universe]]\").\n\n\"The Last One\"'s closing credits differ from those of the rest of the series.

(Before ''St. Elsewhere'', [[Bruce Paltrow]] served as ''Shadow's'' showrunner.) Coolidge occasionally sported a Carver High T-shirt while working at St. Eligius.  In third-season episode \"[[List of St. Elsewhere episodes#ep62|Any Portrait in a Storm]]\", Coolidge sees guest star [[Tim Van Patten|Timothy Van Patten]] (another ''Shadow'' alumnus) in an elevator and calls out  \"Heyyyy!! Salami!!\", to which Van Patten, playing an unrelated character (named Dean, in a three episode story arc), replies \"You got the wrong guy, pal.\", leaving Coolidge trying to plead his case with a confused \"No \u2013 it's Warren.\" as the elevator doors close.\n*The fourth season episode \u201cClose Encounters\u201d has numerous crossovers. \n** In the psychiatric ward, patients watch various MTM-produced shows on television \u2013 MTM (headed by [[Mary Tyler Moore]] and [[Grant Tinker]]) was the company that produced ''St. Elsewhere''. \n*** The patients briefly watch MTM's ''[[The White Shadow (TV series)|The White Shadow]]'', produced by ''St. Elsewhere'' showrunner [[Bruce Paltrow]]. It is seen here as fictional, even though orderly Warren Coolidge is a carryover from ''The White Shadow'' (see above). (In the previous season, the bar from ''[[Cheers]]'' is seen as both fictional ''and'' part of the ''St. Elsewhere'' universe.)\n** The [[amnesiac]] patient John Doe #6, a recurring character played by [[Oliver Clark]], while watching an episode of ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]'' on a hospital TV, believes himself to be that series' lead character [[Mary Richards]]. He then mistakes guest star [[Betty White]] for Sue Anne (the character White had played on that same show). She responds, \"I'm afraid you've mistaken me for someone else.\" \n** John Doe #6 is verbally disparaged by another patient in the psychiatric ward \u2014 Elliott Carlin, the resident neurotic from ''[[The Bob Newhart Show]]'' played by [[Jack Riley (actor)|Jack Riley]]. Carlin's treatment of Doe mirrored his behavior toward Oliver Clark's ''Bob Newhart Show'' character, Mr. Herd. Mr. Carlin subsequently appeared on an episode of ''[[Newhart]]'', still uncured from the damage caused by \"some quack in Chicago.\" \n*In \"Santa Claus is Dead\", Dr. Craig mentions serving in Korea with his drinking buddy, [[B.J. Hunnicutt]], implying that Dr. Hunnicutt was reassigned to another unit in Korea following the July 1953 deactivation of the 4077th Mobile Army Surgical Hospital at the end of ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]''\u2019s finale, \"[[Goodbye, Farewell and Amen]]\".\n*The crew filled the series finale, \"[[List of St. Elsewhere episodes#ep137|The Last One]]\", with an abundance of allusions and homages.  The cold open has Dr. Fiscus saying to an ER patient \"[[David Sarnoff|General Sarnoff]]...\" (the man responsible for launching [[NBC]], the first television network, in 1926) \"... cut down the time you spend in front of the television\". There is a direct reference to the 1967 series finale of ''[[The Fugitive (season 4)#ep120|The Fugitive]]'', when orderly Coolidge catches a \"One-Armed Man\", on a water tower, for \"Dr. Kimble\". A patient appears to get his hair cut by (''[[The Andy Griffith Show]]'''s) [[Floyd Lawson|Floyd the Barber]], including his first name, face and clothing.  There is a call over the public address system for a [[Hospital emergency codes#Code Blue|Code Blue]] (someone has reached their \"end\") in ''[[Room 222]]''.  There is a direct reference to the 1977 series finale of ''[[The Last Show (The Mary Tyler Moore Show)|The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]'', including a group hug, a group shuffle to get tissues and a suggestion that they sing  \"[[It's a Long Way to Tipperary]]\".  The finale for the character [[List of M*A*S*H characters#Henry Blake|Dr. Henry Blake]] in a 1975 episode of ''[[Abyssinia, Henry|M*A*S*H]]'' is referenced when cadaver \"4077\" is autopsied after a \"helicopter crash\".   There are numerous song references, including Dr. Fiscus saying \"[[It's the End of the World as We Know It (And I Feel Fine)|It's the end of the world as we know it, and I feel fine]]\", and Dr. Auschlander exclaiming \"[[Jumpin' Jack Flash|Jumpin' Jack, what was that flash?]]\".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1988-05-28/entertainment/8802010817_1_patient-show-helicopter-crash |title='Elsewhere' End A Pun Fest |last=Gedan |first=Gail |work=[[Sun-Sentinel]] |date=1988-05-28 |accessdate=2016-04-18}}</ref>\n\n''St. Elsewhere'' was also host to one [[Fictional crossover|crossover]], served as the source material for two others, and has been paid homage to in several ways:\n*The third season's finale featured Drs. Westphall, Auschlander, and Craig visiting the eponymous pub of ''[[Cheers]]'' (also set in Boston) for a drink.  During the second season of ''Cheers,'' barmaid [[Carla Tortelli]] ([[Rhea Perlman]]) gave birth to a child at St. Eligius, and here expresses her displeasure about her hospitalization there, even getting into a verbal altercation with Dr. Craig.\n*Two ''St. Elsewhere'' characters were carried over to the NBC series ''[[Homicide: Life on the Street]]'', which was executive produced by ''St. Elsewhere'' alumnus [[Tom Fontana]]. In an episode in season six entitled \"Mercy,\" [[Alfre Woodard]] reprises her role of Dr. Roxanne Turner, who is accused of illegally euthanizing a cancer patient. Woodard was nominated for an Emmy Award as Outstanding Guest Actress in a Drama Series for her performance.  In other ''Homicide'' episodes, the character of Detective Tim Bayliss (played by Kyle Secor) develops a bad back and is treated by an offscreen \"Dr. Ehrlich.\" In the ''Homicide: The Movie'' finale, Ed Begley, Jr., makes an uncredited appearance as Dr. Victor Ehrlich.\n*[[Ed Begley Jr.]], [[William Daniels]], [[Stephen Furst]] and [[Eric Laneuville]] reunited to appear in a season-one episode of ''[[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]]''; the episode saw the actors not reprising their ''St. Elsewhere'' characters but rather guest as a quartet of doctors that fell sick at a medical convention. The episode was part of a week-long series of events honoring [[NBC]]'s 75th Anniversary.<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0696627/trivia ''Scrubs'': \"My Sacrificial Clam\"], from IMDB.com</ref>\n\nShowtime's series ''City on a Hill'' (S01E07 \"There Are No F**king Sides\") based in early 1990s Boston has a hospital scene where Drs. Wesphall and Fiscus and Nurse Papandreau were paged in the background on the hospital's PA system. In S01E08, St. Eligius was mentioned by name.\n\n==Awards and nominations==\n{{main|List of awards and nominations received by St. Elsewhere}}\n''St. Elsewhere'' won 24 out of 106 award nominations.

The series stars [[Ed Flanders]], [[Norman Lloyd]] and [[William Daniels]] as teaching doctors at an aging, rundown [[Boston]] hospital who give interns a promising future in making critical medical and life decisions. The series was produced by [[MTM Enterprises]], which had success with a similar NBC series, the police drama ''[[Hill Street Blues]]'', during that same time. The series were often compared to each other for their use of ensemble casts and overlapping serialized storylines (an original ad for ''St. Elsewhere'' quoted a critic that called the series \"'Hill Street Blues' in a hospital\").\n\nRecognized for its gritty, realistic drama, ''St. Elsewhere'' gained a small yet loyal following (the series never ranked higher than 47th place in the yearly [[Nielsen ratings]]) over its six-season, 137-episode run; however, the series also found a strong audience in Nielsen's 18\u201349 age demographic, a young demo later known for a young, affluent audience that TV advertisers were eager to reach.<ref name=\"AVClub100\">{{cite web | url=https://tv.avclub.com/st-elsewhere-1798230318 | title=St. Elsewhere | author=Emily VanDerWerff | date=March 12, 2012 | access-date=June 10, 2019 | quote=Shows like St. Elsewhere, which pulled in a solid number of younger viewers\u2014indeed, a larger number of younger viewers than some shows in the top 30\u2014could be monetized in that fashion.

(The South End's Franklin Square House Apartments, formerly known as the St. James Hotel and located next to [[Franklin and Blackstone Squares]], stood in for the hospital in establishing shots, including the series' opening sequence.)<ref>[http://virtualglobetrotting.com/map/franklin-square-house-st-elsewhere/ Entry for Franklin Square House] on VirtualGlobetrotting.com</ref> The hospital's nickname, \"St. Elsewhere\", is a slang term used in the medical field to refer to lesser-equipped hospitals that serve patients turned away by more prestigious institutions; it is also used in medical academia to refer to teaching hospitals in general. \n\nIn the pilot episode, surgeon Dr. Mark Craig (William Daniels) informs his colleagues that the local Boston media had bestowed the derogatory nickname upon St. Eligius since they perceived the hospital as \"a dumping ground, a place you wouldn't want to send your mother-in-law.\" In fact, the hospital was so poorly regarded that its shrine to [[Saint Eligius]] was commonly defiled by the hospital's visitors ''and'' staff, and is passingly referred to by Dr. Wayne Fiscus as \"the [[patron saint]] of longshoremen and bowlers.\" Eligius is actually neither; he is patron saint of [[Numismatics|numismatists]], metalworkers, and horses.) According to the hospital's founder, Father Joseph McCabe, he named the hospital after the saint because his father, a cabinet maker, constantly prayed to St. Eligius. McCabe refers to Eligius as the patron saint of artisans.\n\nJust as in ''[[Hill Street Blues]]'', ''St. Elsewhere'' employed a large ensemble cast; a gritty, \"realistic\" visual style; and a multitude of interlocking serialized stories, many of which continued over the course of multiple episodes or seasons. In the same way ''Hill Street'' was regarded as a groundbreaking police drama, ''St. Elsewhere'' also broke new ground in medical dramas, creating a template that influenced ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]'', ''[[Chicago Hope]]'', and other later shows in the genre. ''St. Elsewhere'' portrayed the medical profession as an admirable but less-than-perfect endeavor; the St. Eligius staff, while mostly having good intentions in serving their patients, all had their own personal and professional problems, with the two often intertwining. The staff's problems, and those of their patients (some of whom didn't survive), were often contemporary in nature, with storylines involving [[breast cancer]], [[AIDS]], and addiction. Though the series dealt with serious issues of life, death, the medical profession, and the human effects of all three, a substantial number of comedic moments, inside jokes, and references to television history were included, as well as tender moments of humanity.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1982/11/16/arts/tv-nbc-s-stylish-st-elsewhere.html \"NBC's Stylish 'St. Elsewhere,'\"] review from ''The New York Times'', 11/16/1982</ref>\n\nThe producers for the series were [[Bruce Paltrow]], [[Mark Tinker]], [[John Masius]], [[Tom Fontana]], [[John Falsey]] and [[Abby Singer]]. Tinker, Masius, Fontana, and Paltrow wrote a number of episodes as well; other writers included [[John Tinker (producer)|John Tinker]], [[John Ford Noonan]], [[Charles H. Eglee]], [[Eric Overmyer]], [[Channing Gibson]], and [[Aram Saroyan]].\n[[Image:St Elsewhere.jpg|thumb|The cast of ''St. Elsewhere'' (season one)]]\nThe show's main and end title theme was composed by famed jazz musician and composer [[Dave Grusin]]. Noted film and TV composer [[J. A. C. Redford]] wrote the music for the series (except for the pilot, which was scored by Grusin). No soundtrack was ever released, but the theme was released in two different versions: the original TV mix and edit appeared on [[TVT Records]]' compilation ''Television's Greatest Hits, Vol. 3: 70s & 80s'', and Grusin recorded a full-length version for inclusion on his ''[[Night Lines (Dave Grusin album)|Night Lines]]'' album, released in 1983.\n\n==Main cast==\n{{main|List of St. Elsewhere characters}}\n\nAlong with established actors [[Ed Flanders]], [[Norman Lloyd]] and [[William Daniels]], ''St. Elsewhere's'' ensemble cast included [[David Morse (actor)|David Morse]], [[Alfre Woodard]], [[Bruce Greenwood]], [[Christina Pickles]], [[Kyle Secor]], [[Ed Begley, Jr.|Ed Begley Jr.]], [[Stephen Furst]], [[Howie Mandel]], [[Mark Harmon]], [[Denzel Washington]] and [[Helen Hunt]].

Some of those episodes included:\n\n===\"Qui Transtulit Sustinet\"===\n''Original air date: November 16, 1983''\n\nDr. Morrison learns of the death of his wife, Nina (with whom he had an argument midway through the previous episode, which was the last time he saw her alive), after slipping and hitting her head.  Nina's heart is donated to a heart transplant patient\u2014a patient of Dr. Craig. The poignant final scene of the episode finds Morrison entering the patient's room and, with a [[stethoscope]], hearing the patient's new heart\u2014Nina's heart\u2014steadily beating.\n\n===\"Cheers\"===\n''Original air date: March 27, 1985''\n\n''St. Elsewhere'' ended its 3rd season with this TV [[crossover episode|crossover]] that found Drs. Westphall, Auschlander, and Craig getting together at that other Boston TV institution, the namesake setting of the comedy series ''[[Cheers]]''.  The scene, which was filmed on the main ''Cheers'' soundstage (Stage 25 at the [[Paramount Studios]] lot) and not entirely done for laughs, finds the bar's hypochondriac know-it-all [[Cliff Clavin]], trying and failing to gain free medical advice from the doctors; Auschlander confronting his former accountant, [[Norm Peterson]]; and barmaid [[Carla Tortelli]] voicing her displeasure with the doctors regarding her stay in St. Eligius two years earlier for the birth of her baby.  The scene ends with Westphall announcing to his two colleagues that he has decided to leave St. Eligius and medicine, a short-lived departure, as he returned in the Season 4 premiere. \n\nIn \"E.R.,\" an episode at the end of season 4, a patient mentions an assault by a waitress who is likely Carla Tortelli.\n\n===\"Time Heals\"===\n''Original air date: February 19 and 20, 1986''\n\nThis two-part episode featured storylines that fleshed out the 50-year history of St. Eligius, each sequence taped in a different style (i.e. black-and-white for the 1930s setting, muted colors for the 1940s). The storylines included the hospital's 1936 founding by Fr. Joseph McCabe (played by [[Edward Herrmann]]), the arrivals of Dr. Auschlander and Nurse Rosenthal, the early struggles of Mark Craig and his relationship with his mentor (which mirrored Craig's later mentoring of Dr. Ehrlich), the death of Dr. Westphall's wife, and Dr. Morrison simultaneously dealing with an overdose patient, a knee injury, and the disappearance of his son.  ''[[TV Guide]]'' ranked \"Time Heals\" No. 44 on its 1997 list of [[TV Guide's 100 Greatest Episodes of All Time|\"100 Greatest Episodes of All Time\"]], calling the episode \"a masterwork of dramatic writing.\"<ref>{{cite journal |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |year=1997 |title=Special Collector's Issue: 100 Greatest Episodes of All Time |journal=[[TV Guide]] |volume= |issue=June 28\u2013July 4 |pages= }}</ref>\n\n===\"After Life\"===\n''Original air date: November 26, 1986''\n\nThis episode deals with the shooting of Dr. Wayne Fiscus, who is critically wounded while trying to capture fireflies in the park across from St. Eligius during a break from rounds. As the staff frantically try to save him, Fiscus ventures back-and-forth between Hell (where he meets former colleague, and rapist, Peter White); Purgatory; and Heaven, where he has a conversation with God, who presents Himself as a spitting image of Fiscus.  Just as Fiscus shakes hands with [[Lou Gehrig]], his colleagues successfully revive him back to Earth.\n\n===\"Last Dance at the Wrecker's Ball\"===\n''Original air date: May 27, 1987''\n\nIn the season-five finale, all attempts to save St. Eligius from closing seem to have failed. As demolition begins, a frail Dr. Auschlander, accidentally left in the hospital after a relapse, attempts to escape.\n\n===\"A Moon For the Misbegotten\"===\n''Original air date: September 30, 1987''\n\nSt. Eligius is saved (and any damage from the above-mentioned \"Wrecker's Ball\" repaired), but it falls under the new ownership of Ecumena Corporation, a national [[managed health care]] concern. (The use of \"Ecumena\" garnered some real-life controversy, as [[Humana]] thought the use of that name sounded too much like its own; the trademark-infringement lawsuit that ensued prompted [[NBC]] to begin airing post-episode disclaimers stating that Ecumena was indeed fictional,<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/02/arts/st-elsewhere-told-to-carry-disclaimer.html \"'St. Elsewhere' Told to Carry Disclaimer\"] from ''The New York Times'', October 2, 1987</ref> and to change the corporate name mid-season to \"Weigert.\"<ref>[http://articles.latimes.com/1987-12-13/entertainment/ca-28851_1_trademark-infringement \"St. Name Change\"] from ''The Los Angeles Times'', December 13, 1987</ref>) Ecumena's choice to head St. Eligius, Dr. John Gideon, mixed like oil and water with the St. Eligius staff, especially Dr. Westphall, who, in the final scene of this episode (and [[Ed Flanders]]'s last moment as a ''St. Elsewhere'' series regular), delivers his resignation \"in terms you can understand\"\u2014by dropping his pants and [[Mooning|exposing his bare buttocks]] to Gideon (\"You can kiss my ass, pal\"). This scene, which would normally be considered controversial, was preserved by NBC's censors as they did not consider Westphall's display to be erotic in nature.<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0707875/trivia?ref_=tt_trv_trv Source: \"St. Elsewhere: A Moon for the Misbegotten,\"] from IMDb.</ref>\n\n===\"Their Town\"===\n''Original air date: April 20, 1988''\n\nIn a somewhat change-of-pace episode, Drs. Craig and Novino, Ellen Craig, and Lizzie Westphall visit Donald and Tommy Westphall (Lizzie's father and brother, respectively), who appear to be enjoying the quiet life in small town [[New Hampshire]].  The episode features Dr. Westphall occasionally breaking the [[fourth wall]] and speaking directly to the viewer, a la the \"Stage Manager\" character in ''[[Our Town]]'' (the episode title and its location are nods to the [[Thornton Wilder]] play).\n\n===\"The Last One\"===\n[[File:TommyWestphall-TheLastOne-1988.jpg|right|thumb|Tommy holds the St. Eligius snow globe in the final moments of \"The Last One\".]]\n''Original air date: May 25, 1988''\n\n''St. Elsewhere''{{'}}s [[series finale]] features momentous changes for several main characters, including the departures of Drs. Fiscus and Morrison and the death of Dr. Auschlander, as well as the return of Dr. Westphall to an active leadership role at St. Eligius after Weigert agrees to sell the hospital back to the Boston archdiocese, as Dr. Gideon is set to move on to another hospital in San Jose, California. The finale is more known for its provocative final scene: Westphall and his son [[Tommy Westphall]] (played by [[Chad Allen (actor)|Chad Allen]]), who has [[autism]], are seen in Dr. Auschlander's office watching snow falling outside. The image cuts to an exterior shot of the hospital. At that moment, Tommy and Daniel Auschlander are seen in an apartment building, with Tommy playing with a snow globe. Donald arrives home from a day of work, and it is clear from the uniform he wears and the dialog in this scene that he works in construction. \"Auschlander\" is revealed to be Donald's father, and thus Tommy's grandfather. Donald laments to his father, \"I don't understand this autism thing, Pop. Here's my son. I talk to him. I don't even know if he can hear me, because he sits there, all day long, in his own world, staring at that toy. What's he thinking about?\" As Tommy shakes the snow globe, he is told by his father to come and wash his hands for dinner. Donald places the snow globe on the family's television set and walks into the kitchen with Tommy and Auschlander; as they leave the room, the camera closes in on the snow globe\u2014which holds a replica of St. Eligius.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tvacres.com/signoffs_finales_elsewhere.htm|title=TV ACRES: Quotations > Signoffs > Classic Series Finales > St. Elsewhere|access-date=August 9, 2015|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120913144744/http://www.tvacres.com/signoffs_finales_elsewhere.htm|archive-date=September 13, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe most common interpretation of this scene is that the entire series of events in the series ''St. Elsewhere'' had been a product of Tommy Westphall's imagination, with elements of the above scene used as its own evidence.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/2951086.stm | work=BBC News | title=TV's strangest endings | date=May 30, 2003 | access-date=May 24, 2010 | first=William | last=Gallagher}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=CSTB&p_theme=cstb&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EB36DD7B6BEB6B7&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM | title=Chicago Sun-Times:: Search | date=May 26, 1988 | work=Chicago Sun-Times | first=Robert | last=Feder}}</ref> Author Cynthia Burkhead explains that with this final shot, \"St. Elsewhere managed to take the idea of a dream and alter it just enough, putting it in the imagination of an autistic boy\", and surmises that an ending constructed in this manner \"reminds viewers that the fiction they have watched for six years is actually fiction within a fiction, occupying a second level of unreality, one level beyond the space of illusion filled by all narrative television.\"<ref>{{cite thesis|last1=Burkhead|first1=Cynthia A.|title=Dancing Dwarfs and Talking Fish: The Narrative Functions of Television Dreams|date=December 2010|publisher=[[Middle Tennessee State University]]|id=No.3459290{{ProQuest|873898276}}|degree=Ph.D.|location=Murfreesboro, TN|page=157}}</ref> A notable result of this ending has been the attempt by individuals to determine how many television shows are also products of Tommy Westphall's mind owing to its [[Fictional crossover|shared fictional characters]] (the \"[[Tommy Westphall#The Tommy Westphall Universe Hypothesis|Tommy Westphall Universe]]\").\n\n\"The Last One\"'s closing credits differ from those of the rest of the series. In all other episodes, the credits appear over a still image of an ongoing surgical operation, followed by the traditional [[MTM Enterprises|MTM Productions]] black-backgrounded logo, featuring [[MTM Enterprises#Mimsie the Cat|Mimsie the Cat]] in a cartoon surgical cap and mask; here, the credits appear on a black background, flanked by an [[electrocardiogram]] and an IV bag, with Mimsie lying on her side at the top of the screen; at the end of the credits, the heart monitor [[Asystole|flatlines]], marking Mimsie's death and the end of ''St. Elsewhere''.

(Before ''St. Elsewhere'', [[Bruce Paltrow]] served as ''Shadow's'' showrunner.) Coolidge occasionally sported a Carver High T-shirt while working at St. Eligius.  In third-season episode \"[[List of St. Elsewhere episodes#ep62|Any Portrait in a Storm]]\", Coolidge sees guest star [[Tim Van Patten|Timothy Van Patten]] (another ''Shadow'' alumnus) in an elevator and calls out  \"Heyyyy!! Salami!!\", to which Van Patten, playing an unrelated character (named Dean, in a three episode story arc), replies \"You got the wrong guy, pal.\", leaving Coolidge trying to plead his case with a confused \"No \u2013 it's Warren.\" as the elevator doors close.\n*The fourth season episode \u201cClose Encounters\u201d has numerous crossovers. \n** In the psychiatric ward, patients watch various MTM-produced shows on television \u2013 MTM (headed by [[Mary Tyler Moore]] and [[Grant Tinker]]) was the company that produced ''St. Elsewhere''. \n*** The patients briefly watch MTM's ''[[The White Shadow (TV series)|The White Shadow]]'', produced by ''St. Elsewhere'' showrunner [[Bruce Paltrow]]. It is seen here as fictional, even though orderly Warren Coolidge is a carryover from ''The White Shadow'' (see above). (In the previous season, the bar from ''[[Cheers]]'' is seen as both fictional ''and'' part of the ''St. Elsewhere'' universe.)\n** The [[amnesiac]] patient John Doe #6, a recurring character played by [[Oliver Clark]], while watching an episode of ''[[The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]'' on a hospital TV, believes himself to be that series' lead character [[Mary Richards]]. He then mistakes guest star [[Betty White]] for Sue Anne (the character White had played on that same show). She responds, \"I'm afraid you've mistaken me for someone else.\" \n** John Doe #6 is verbally disparaged by another patient in the psychiatric ward \u2014 Elliott Carlin, the resident neurotic from ''[[The Bob Newhart Show]]'' played by [[Jack Riley (actor)|Jack Riley]]. Carlin's treatment of Doe mirrored his behavior toward Oliver Clark's ''Bob Newhart Show'' character, Mr. Herd. Mr. Carlin subsequently appeared on an episode of ''[[Newhart]]'', still uncured from the damage caused by \"some quack in Chicago.\" \n*In \"Santa Claus is Dead\", Dr. Craig mentions serving in Korea with his drinking buddy, [[B.J. Hunnicutt]], implying that Dr. Hunnicutt was reassigned to another unit in Korea following the July 1953 deactivation of the 4077th Mobile Army Surgical Hospital at the end of ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]''\u2019s finale, \"[[Goodbye, Farewell and Amen]]\".\n*The crew filled the series finale, \"[[List of St. Elsewhere episodes#ep137|The Last One]]\", with an abundance of allusions and homages.  The cold open has Dr. Fiscus saying to an ER patient \"[[David Sarnoff|General Sarnoff]]...\" (the man responsible for launching [[NBC]], the first television network, in 1926) \"... cut down the time you spend in front of the television\". There is a direct reference to the 1967 series finale of ''[[The Fugitive (season 4)#ep120|The Fugitive]]'', when orderly Coolidge catches a \"One-Armed Man\", on a water tower, for \"Dr. Kimble\". A patient appears to get his hair cut by (''[[The Andy Griffith Show]]'''s) [[Floyd Lawson|Floyd the Barber]], including his first name, face and clothing.  There is a call over the public address system for a [[Hospital emergency codes#Code Blue|Code Blue]] (someone has reached their \"end\") in ''[[Room 222]]''.  There is a direct reference to the 1977 series finale of ''[[The Last Show (The Mary Tyler Moore Show)|The Mary Tyler Moore Show]]'', including a group hug, a group shuffle to get tissues and a suggestion that they sing  \"[[It's a Long Way to Tipperary]]\".  The finale for the character [[List of M*A*S*H characters#Henry Blake|Dr. Henry Blake]] in a 1975 episode of ''[[Abyssinia, Henry|M*A*S*H]]'' is referenced when cadaver \"4077\" is autopsied after a \"helicopter crash\".   There are numerous song references, including Dr. Fiscus saying \"[[It's the End of the World as We Know It (And I Feel Fine)|It's the end of the world as we know it, and I feel fine]]\", and Dr. Auschlander exclaiming \"[[Jumpin' Jack Flash|Jumpin' Jack, what was that flash?]]\".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/1988-05-28/entertainment/8802010817_1_patient-show-helicopter-crash |title='Elsewhere' End A Pun Fest |last=Gedan |first=Gail |work=[[Sun-Sentinel]] |date=1988-05-28 |accessdate=2016-04-18}}</ref>\n\n''St. Elsewhere'' was also host to one [[Fictional crossover|crossover]], served as the source material for two others, and has been paid homage to in several ways:\n*The third season's finale featured Drs. Westphall, Auschlander, and Craig visiting the eponymous pub of ''[[Cheers]]'' (also set in Boston) for a drink.  During the second season of ''Cheers,'' barmaid [[Carla Tortelli]] ([[Rhea Perlman]]) gave birth to a child at St. Eligius, and here expresses her displeasure about her hospitalization there, even getting into a verbal altercation with Dr. Craig.\n*Two ''St. Elsewhere'' characters were carried over to the NBC series ''[[Homicide: Life on the Street]]'', which was executive produced by ''St. Elsewhere'' alumnus [[Tom Fontana]]. In an episode in season six entitled \"Mercy,\" [[Alfre Woodard]] reprises her role of Dr. Roxanne Turner, who is accused of illegally euthanizing a cancer patient. Woodard was nominated for an Emmy Award as Outstanding Guest Actress in a Drama Series for her performance.  In other ''Homicide'' episodes, the character of Detective Tim Bayliss (played by Kyle Secor) develops a bad back and is treated by an offscreen \"Dr. Ehrlich.\" In the ''Homicide: The Movie'' finale, Ed Begley, Jr., makes an uncredited appearance as Dr. Victor Ehrlich.\n*[[Ed Begley Jr.]], [[William Daniels]], [[Stephen Furst]] and [[Eric Laneuville]] reunited to appear in a season-one episode of ''[[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]]''; the episode saw the actors not reprising their ''St. Elsewhere'' characters but rather guest as a quartet of doctors that fell sick at a medical convention. The episode was part of a week-long series of events honoring [[NBC]]'s 75th Anniversary.<ref>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0696627/trivia ''Scrubs'': \"My Sacrificial Clam\"], from IMDB.com</ref>\n\nShowtime's series ''City on a Hill'' (S01E07 \"There Are No F**king Sides\") based in early 1990's Boston has a hospital scene where Drs.

Cady and her parents have moved to a Chicago suburb from Kenya, but Cady soon realizes that her high school classmates do not readily accept others who differ from them, yet she is ready to accept the challenge of friendship at the High School (\"It Roars\"). Cady is excited by the prospect of making new friends, but no one seems to like her or even acknowledge her (\"It Roars (Reprise)\"). Janis and Damian decide to help Cady as she tries to find her social group (\"Where Do You Belong?\"). Janis and Damian describe the clique of high school social royalty dubbed \"the Plastics.\" The trio is led by Regina George, the \"Queen Bee\"; Gretchen Wieners, Regina's nervous, eager-to-please second-in-command; and Karen Smith, the stereotypical dumb blonde. Regina and her fellow Plastics decide that the new girl will eat lunch with them for the rest of the week. (\"Meet the Plastics\"). When Cady tells her new friends Damian and Janis about the invite, Janis asks Cady to say yes to the Plastics and tell them everything they say. Damian tries to explain why they hate Regina, but Janis won't let him.\n\nIn AP Calculus class, Cady meets the dreamy Aaron Samuels and immediately falls for him (\"Stupid with Love\"). Kevin, head of the Mathletes, is impressed with Cady's performance in class and asks Cady to join Mathletes. Gretchen warns Cady that joining the Mathletes is social suicide and Regina is mean to Kevin to get him to go away. Cady thinks Regina is nice for 'protecting' her, but Janis warns her that Regina is dangerous. However, amazed and intoxicated by her newfound power, Cady doesn't pay attention to Janis' words (\"Apex Predator\"). At the mall, Gretchen asks Cady if she's met any boys she likes. When Cady tells her about Aaron Samuels, Gretchen is horrified because Aaron is Regina's ex-boyfriend, which makes him off-limits to Cady, as Regina's friend. The Plastics and Cady then hang out at Regina's house, where they meet her \"cool mom\". Gretchen and Karen show Cady their old Burn Book, where they put photos of their classmates and write mean comments about them. When they come across Janis' photo in the book, Gretchen explains that Janis and Regina used to be best friends. Regina tells Cady that Janis freaked out when Regina couldn't invite her to her thirteenth birthday party, and ended up in art therapy. Later, Gretchen confides in Cady that, because of the state of her friendship with Regina, she has lost all confidence in herself (\"What's Wrong With Me?\").\n\nThe next day Aaron discusses his previous relationship with Regina, and how she made him feel like not-himself, telling Cady he has sworn off dating. After an awkwardly concealed verbal slip-up results in him explaining a math problem to her, Cady believes that if she acts stupid, Aaron will help her with her work, and therefore talk to her more (\"Stupid with Love (Reprise)\"). After using this tactic, Aaron invites Cady to his Halloween party. Karen explains that in high school, Halloween revolves around looking sexy: the costume must be hot (\"Sexy\"). Cady doesn't know this and shows up at the party in a 'scary' costume, embarrassing herself. Later at the party, Gretchen, in order to gain Regina's approval, tells Regina about Cady's crush on Aaron. Spitefully, Regina decides to flirt with Aaron until he agrees to get back together with her (\"Someone Gets Hurt\"). Cady sees Aaron kissing Regina and is devastated.\n\nFurious, Cady shows up at Damian's house and tells her friends what happened. Damian tells Cady the real reason Regina and Janis stopped being friends- in 8th grade, Regina accused Janis of being a lesbian and when Janis was unable to deny it, classmates bullied Janis until she left school. The three friends decide that they will work together to get revenge on Regina, giving her K\u00e4lteen Bars so that she will gain weight. They also trick Gretchen by sending a fake Candy Cane Gram to Cady from \"Regina\" saying that they are now best friends. This leads Gretchen to reveal Regina's secret hook-ups with Shane Oman, among other vengeful acts (\"Revenge Party\"). After the Plastics' \"Rockin' Around the Pole\" dance at the school talent show is disastrous, people start noticing Regina's weight gain. Later, when Regina breaks one of the Plastics' artificial clothing rules, Cady stands up to her, banning her from sitting at their table. Everyone is relieved to be freed from Regina's rule (\"Fearless\"). Cady tries to apologize to Regina for kicking her from the lunch table, but Regina insinuates that her reign is far from over (\"Someone Gets Hurt (Reprise)\").\n\n===Act Two===\n\nAfter winter break, Cady has undergone a complete makeover befitting of her new \"Queen Bee\" status leading Karen and Gretchen. (\"A Cautionary Tale (Reprise)\"). Cady tells Janis she cannot attend her art show because of a trip with her parents and Damian and Janis dislike her new, Plastic-like behavior. Damian and the other girls of North Shore High School try to hamper Cady's ever-growing social obsessions and to stop acting dumb for Aaron by telling her about their own negative past experiences with obsessive behavior (\"Stop\"). Gretchen and Karen convince Cady to lie to her parents and throw a 'small' party while her parents are gone that weekend. Gretchen starts to notice similarities between her friendship with Regina, and her friendship with the new Queen Bee Cady, while Regina's mother wonders why her daughter won't confide in her. She reminisces about the old days when Regina was a child while Gretchen is contemplating being friends with Cady. (\"What's Wrong With Me? (Reprise)\").\n\nFollowing Gretchen and Karen's advice, Cady throws a party in an attempt to get Aaron to come over. She becomes intoxicated as the party goes on and gets crazier (\"Whose House is This?\"). When Aaron shows up, they sneak off to her bedroom. Cady tells Aaron the \"funny\" story about how she pretended that she was dumb to make him like her. Aaron explains that he really liked who Cady was before she became a Plastic (\"More is Better\"). Aaron leaves, angry at Cady's transformation, and Cady chases after him. Outside, Cady runs into Janis and Damian, who came to confront Cady after the art show. They tell Cady that she betrayed their trust, lied to them, and has gone full Plastic. Cady accuses Janis of being in love with her, just as Regina did years ago. Janis and Damian are disgusted by Cady's behavior. Janis throws the picture that she submitted to her art show at Cady, revealing the winning painting was of the three of them (\"Someone Gets Hurt (Reprise 2)\").\n\nWhen Regina discovers that she was not invited to Cady's party and that the K\u00e4lteen Bars given to her by Cady are what made her gain weight, she decides to get revenge by releasing the Burn Book, after adding \"Regina is a Fugly Cow\" to the book in order to take the blame off of herself. She throws copies of the Burn Book pages all over the school, revealing the insults about everyone they know, except Karen, Gretchen and Cady. (\"World Burn\"). All of the junior class girls begin fist fighting over the insults. Janis and Damian see an insult in the book that only Cady could have written about Damian. At a required assembly about the Burn Book, Ms. Norbury tries to bring the girls together. Janis explains her philosophy to the school, referencing her failed friendships with both Cady and Regina empowering the girls to stand up for themselves (\"I'd Rather Be Me\"). When Regina storms out in anger and disbelief, Cady tries to apologize, but Regina is distracted and is hit by a passing school bus.\n\nRegina's bus accident prompts Cady to reevaluate herself and realize what a monster she has become. Cady decides to take the full blame for the Burn Book, despite having not written the entire thing herself, because Ms. Norbury is about to be fired due to the things Cady wrote. She is suspended for three weeks and banned from the Spring Fling (\"Fearless (Reprise)\"). When Cady returns to school, Ms. Norbury offers her a way to earn some extra credit and save her grade: Cady must join the Mathletes at the state championships. The team wins, and Cady feels redeemed (\"Do This Thing\"). She then sneaks into Spring Fling with Aaron's help, after kissing him. There, she runs into Regina, and they have a heart-to-heart conversation and make up.\n\nCady is elected as Spring Fling Queen but notices how fragile and cheap the plastic crown is, breaking it into many pieces, and gives a piece to each girl at Spring Fling while complimenting each one - telling them they are all \"real, and rare\". She apologizes to Janis and Damian, and they move forward as friends once more. Cady, Damian, Janis, Gretchen, Karen, Aaron, and Regina join together, finally accepting each other (\"I See Stars\").\n\n==Cast and characters==\n===Original cast===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|-\n!

Every one of the principals gets a musical moment that tells us who they are, both the protective outer shell developed to survive the savage jungle of high school, and the tender human core, yearning to connect... While the show's book outshines the score, the songs pack in their share of wit, both in Benjamin's nimble lyrics (recalling her work on the Legally Blonde musical) and Richmond's buoyant tunes, which borrow with a wink from a variety of styles.\"<ref>Rooney, David.

Some of the movie\u2019s best jokes don\u2019t fully land in their delivery...It\u2019s not shocking that 'Mean Girls' is a fast-paced fancy fun time, but it\u2019s a real treat to find that it\u2019s still witty, worldly, and wise.\"<ref>Holdren, Sara.

Mr. Richmond and Ms. Benjamin\u2019s many (many) musical numbers are passable by middle-of-the-road Broadway standards, yet they rarely capture either the tone or the time of being a certain age in a certain era... the show weighs in at two and a half hours, as opposed to the movie\u2019s zippy 97 minutes.\" However, he ultimately stated he enjoyed parts of the performance, saying: \"There\u2019s a reason the show is called 'Mean Girls.' They're the next-door versions of those cosmetically perfect pop and movie stars whose public vanities and follies we savor with such glee. Ms. Fey is an ace student of this universal prurience.

Cady and her parents have moved to a Chicago suburb from Kenya, but Cady soon realizes that her high school classmates do not readily accept others who differ from them, yet she is ready to accept the challenge of friendship at the High School (\"It Roars\"). Cady is excited by the prospect of making new friends, but no one seems to like her or even acknowledge her (\"It Roars (Reprise)\"). Janis and Damian decide to help Cady as she tries to find her social group (\"Where Do You Belong?\"). Janis and Damian describe the clique of high school social royalty dubbed \"the Plastics.\" The trio is led by Regina George, the \"Queen Bee\"; Gretchen Wieners, Regina's nervous, eager-to-please second-in-command; and Karen Smith, the stereotypical dumb blonde. Regina and her fellow Plastics decide that the new girl will eat lunch with them for the rest of the week. (\"Meet the Plastics\"). When Cady tells her new friends Damian and Janis about the invite, Janis asks Cady to say yes to the Plastics and tell them everything they say. Damian tries to explain why they hate Regina, but Janis won't let him.\n\nIn AP Calculus class, Cady meets the dreamy Aaron Samuels and immediately falls for him (\"Stupid with Love\"). Kevin, head of the Mathletes, is impressed with Cady's performance in class and asks Cady to join Mathletes. Gretchen warns Cady that joining the Mathletes is social suicide and Regina is mean to Kevin to get him to go away. Cady thinks Regina is nice for 'protecting' her, but Janis warns her that Regina is dangerous. However, amazed and intoxicated by her newfound power, Cady doesn't pay attention to Janis' words (\"Apex Predator\"). At the mall, Gretchen asks Cady if she's met any boys she likes. When Cady tells her about Aaron Samuels, Gretchen is horrified because Aaron is Regina's ex-boyfriend, which makes him off-limits to Cady, as Regina's friend. The Plastics and Cady then hang out at Regina's house, where they meet her \"cool mom\". Gretchen and Karen show Cady their old Burn Book, where they put photos of their classmates and write mean comments about them. When they come across Janis' photo in the book, Gretchen explains that Janis and Regina used to be best friends. Regina tells Cady that Janis freaked out when Regina couldn't invite her to her thirteenth birthday party, and ended up in art therapy. Later, Gretchen confides in Cady that, because of the state of her friendship with Regina, she has lost all confidence in herself (\"What's Wrong With Me?\").\n\nThe next day Aaron discusses his previous relationship with Regina, and how she made him feel like not-himself, telling Cady he has sworn off dating. After an awkwardly concealed verbal slip-up results in him explaining a math problem to her, Cady believes that if she acts stupid, Aaron will help her with her work, and therefore talk to her more (\"Stupid with Love (Reprise)\"). After using this tactic, Aaron invites Cady to his Halloween party. Karen explains that in high school, Halloween revolves around looking sexy: the costume must be hot (\"Sexy\"). Cady doesn't know this and shows up at the party in a 'scary' costume, embarrassing herself. Later at the party, Gretchen, in order to gain Regina's approval, tells Regina about Cady's crush on Aaron. Spitefully, Regina decides to flirt with Aaron until he agrees to get back together with her (\"Someone Gets Hurt\"). Cady sees Aaron kissing Regina and is devastated.\n\nFurious, Cady shows up at Damian's house and tells her friends what happened. Damian tells Cady the real reason Regina and Janis stopped being friends- in 8th grade, Regina accused Janis of being a lesbian and when Janis was unable to deny it, classmates bullied Janis until she left school. The three friends decide that they will work together to get revenge on Regina, giving her K\u00e4lteen Bars so that she will gain weight. They also trick Gretchen by sending a fake Candy Cane Gram to Cady from \"Regina\" saying that they are now best friends. This leads Gretchen to reveal Regina's secret hook-ups with Shane Oman, among other vengeful acts (\"Revenge Party\"). After the Plastics' \"Rockin' Around the Pole\" dance at the school talent show is disastrous, people start noticing Regina's weight gain. Later, when Regina breaks one of the Plastics' artificial clothing rules, Cady stands up to her, banning her from sitting at their table. Everyone is relieved to be freed from Regina's rule (\"Fearless\"). Cady tries to apologize to Regina for kicking her from the lunch table, but Regina insinuates that her reign is far from over (\"Someone Gets Hurt (Reprise)\").\n\n===Act Two===\n\nAfter winter break, Cady has undergone a complete makeover befitting of her new \"Queen Bee\" status leading Karen and Gretchen. (\"A Cautionary Tale (Reprise)\"). Cady tells Janis she cannot attend her art show because of a trip with her parents and Damian and Janis dislike her new, Plastic-like behavior. Damian and the other girls of North Shore High School try to hamper Cady's ever-growing social obsessions and to stop acting dumb for Aaron by telling her about their own negative past experiences with obsessive behavior (\"Stop\"). Gretchen and Karen convince Cady to lie to her parents and throw a 'small' party while her parents are gone that weekend. Gretchen starts to notice similarities between her friendship with Regina, and her friendship with the new Queen Bee Cady, while Regina's mother wonders why her daughter won't confide in her. She reminisces about the old days when Regina was a child while Gretchen is contemplating being friends with Cady. (\"What's Wrong With Me? (Reprise)\").\n\nFollowing Gretchen and Karen's advice, Cady throws a party in an attempt to get Aaron to come over. She becomes intoxicated as the party goes on and gets crazier (\"Whose House is This?\"). When Aaron shows up, they sneak off to her bedroom. Cady tells Aaron the \"funny\" story about how she pretended that she was dumb to make him like her. Aaron explains that he really liked who Cady was before she became a Plastic (\"More is Better\"). Aaron leaves, angry at Cady's transformation, and Cady chases after him. Outside, Cady runs into Janis and Damian, who came to confront Cady after the art show. They tell Cady that she betrayed their trust, lied to them, and has gone full Plastic. Cady accuses Janis of being in love with her, just as Regina did years ago. Janis and Damian are disgusted by Cady's behavior. Janis throws the picture that she submitted to her art show at Cady, revealing the winning painting was of the three of them (\"Someone Gets Hurt (Reprise 2)\").\n\nWhen Regina discovers that she was not invited to Cady's party and that the K\u00e4lteen Bars given to her by Cady are what made her gain weight, she decides to get revenge by releasing the Burn Book, after adding \"Regina is a Fugly Cow\" to the book in order to take the blame off of herself. She throws copies of the Burn Book pages all over the school, revealing the insults about everyone they know, except Karen, Gretchen and Cady. (\"World Burn\"). All of the junior class girls begin fist fighting over the insults. Janis and Damian see an insult in the book that only Cady could have written about Damian. At a required assembly about the Burn Book, Ms. Norbury tries to bring the girls together. Janis explains her philosophy to the school, referencing her failed friendships with both Cady and Regina empowering the girls to stand up for themselves (\"I'd Rather Be Me\"). When Regina storms out in anger and disbelief, Cady tries to apologize, but Regina is distracted and is hit by a passing school bus.\n\nRegina's bus accident prompts Cady to reevaluate herself and realize what a monster she has become. Cady decides to take the full blame for the Burn Book, despite having not written the entire thing herself, because Ms. Norbury is about to be fired due to the things Cady wrote. She is suspended for three weeks and banned from the Spring Fling (\"Fearless (Reprise)\"). When Cady returns to school, Ms. Norbury offers her a way to earn some extra credit and save her grade: Cady must join the Mathletes at the state championships. The team wins, and Cady feels redeemed (\"Do This Thing\"). She then sneaks into Spring Fling with Aaron's help, after kissing him. There, she runs into Regina, and they have a heart-to-heart conversation and make up.\n\nCady is elected as Spring Fling Queen but notices how fragile and cheap the plastic crown is, breaking it into many pieces, and gives a piece to each girl at Spring Fling while complimenting each one - telling them they are all \"real, and rare\". She apologizes to Janis and Damian, and they move forward as friends once more. Cady, Damian, Janis, Gretchen, Karen, Aaron, and Regina join together, finally accepting each other (\"I See Stars\").\n\n==Cast and characters==\n===Original cast===\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|-\n!

Every one of the principals gets a musical moment that tells us who they are, both the protective outer shell developed to survive the savage jungle of high school, and the tender human core, yearning to connect... While the show's book outshines the score, the songs pack in their share of wit, both in Benjamin's nimble lyrics (recalling her work on the Legally Blonde musical) and Richmond's buoyant tunes, which borrow with a wink from a variety of styles.\"<ref>Rooney, David.

The first act is so strong, with such a well-built, fast-paced arc, that the second half feels like it takes a few tugs on the starter cord before the lawn mower fires up again. Some of the movie\u2019s best jokes don\u2019t fully land in their delivery...It\u2019s not shocking that 'Mean Girls' is a fast-paced fancy fun time, but it\u2019s a real treat to find that it\u2019s still witty, worldly, and wise.\"<ref>Holdren, Sara.

Mr. Richmond and Ms. Benjamin\u2019s many (many) musical numbers are passable by middle-of-the-road Broadway standards, yet they rarely capture either the tone or the time of being a certain age in a certain era... the show weighs in at two and a half hours, as opposed to the movie\u2019s zippy 97 minutes.\" However, he ultimately stated he enjoyed parts of the performance, saying: \"There\u2019s a reason the show is called 'Mean Girls.' They're the next-door versions of those cosmetically perfect pop and movie stars whose public vanities and follies we savor with such glee. Ms. Fey is an ace student of this universal prurience. She's also smart enough to let us wallow in and renounce it at the same time.\"<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/08/theater/mean-girls-review-broadway-musical.html |title=Review: 'Mean Girls' Sets the Perils of Being Popular to Song |last=Brantley |first=Ben |date=2018-04-08 |work=The New York Times |access-date=2019-06-04 |language=en-US |issn=0362-4331}}</ref>\n\n''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'''s Kristen Baldwin gave the musical a B+, writing: \"An ode to self-respect and the benefits of a STEM-based education, Broadway\u2019s ''Mean Girls'' is a lively, frequently hilarious adaptation of Tina Fey\u2019s 2004 high school comedy.

[[My Israel]] leader [[Naftali Bennett]] won over incumbent MK [[Zevulun Orlev]], winning more than two thirds of the vote, and Orlev announced he was resigning from politics. A week later, primaries for the remaining members of the list were held, and [[Nissan Slomiansky]], [[Ayelet Shaked]], and [[Uri Orbach]] reached the top spots. With the National Union breaking up, Uri Ariel officially re-united Tkuma with the Jewish Home to run on a joint list in the [[2013 Israeli legislative election|2013 Israeli elections]]. A few Moledet candidates were included. In the elections that were held on 22 January 2013, the Jewish Home won 12 seats. The Jewish Home entered the [[thirty-third government of Israel]] under prime minister [[Benjamin Netanyahu]], and has 3 ministers (Bennett, Ariel, and Orbach) and 2 deputy-ministers (Ben-Dahan and Wortzman).\n\nAs part of its 2013 coalition agreement, the Jewish Home had the right to veto any laws that change the status quo on religious issues. In December 2013, the party vetoed a [[Yesh Atid]]-proposed bill that sought to give [[gay]] fathers equal tax benefits, saying it would have far-reaching implications on marriage laws. Currently, mothers receive more benefits than do fathers under the law, and thus, couples composed of two men are ineligible for certain tax breaks.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/lapid-bennett-at-odds-again-over-gay-benefits-bill/|title=Lapid, Bennett at odds again over gay benefits bill|author=Lazar Berman |newspaper=The Times of Israel |date=18 December 2013 |accessdate=28 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn December 2016, the party's member [[Shuli Mualem]] proposed the so-called Regulation Bill.

Currently, mothers receive more benefits than do fathers under the law, and thus, couples composed of two men are ineligible for certain tax breaks.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/lapid-bennett-at-odds-again-over-gay-benefits-bill/|title=Lapid, Bennett at odds again over gay benefits bill|author=Lazar Berman |newspaper=The Times of Israel |date=18 December 2013 |accessdate=28 June 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn December 2016, the party's member [[Shuli Mualem]] proposed the so-called Regulation Bill.
