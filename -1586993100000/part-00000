Spain possessed all the elements of greatness and prosperity, when bigotry, in alliance with despotism, set to work to stifle the high spirit of the nation. The first commencement of this work of darkness was the expulsion of the Jews, and its crowning act the expulsion of the Moors, whereby two millions of the most industrious and well-to-do inhabitants were driven out of Spain with their capital.\" (From List's ''The National System of Political Economy'', p 58.)</ref>\n\n== Thought ==\nHe was \"deeply\" influenced by [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]] throughout his career.<ref>This is according to historian [[Frederick C. Beiser]] in his ''[[Weltschmerz]]: [[Pessimism]] in German Philosophy, 1860-1900'', [[Oxford]]: [[Oxford University Press]], 2018, Chapter 6, \"The Optimism of Eugen D\u00fchring,\" p. 87. \"As a young man D\u00fchring read Schopenhauer, who deeply impressed him. He admired his clarity, rigour and bluntness, and especially his stand against university philosophy. In his opinion, in breadth and depth, Schopenhauer stood head and shoulders above all the [[German Idealism|post-Kantians]]. It was Schopenhauer\u2019s great merit, D\u00fchring believed, to have dragged philosophy out of its scholastic cocoon and to have made it confront the greatest question of them all: to be or not to be. That question was for D\u00fchring nothing less than 'the chief theme of philosophy.' \" (''Der Werth des Lebens'' (1865), p. 1) </ref> D\u00fchring's opinions changed considerably after his first appearance as a writer. His earlier work, {{lang|de|Nat\u00fcrliche Dialektik}} (''Natural Dialectics''), is entirely in the spirit of [[critical philosophy]]. Later, in his movement towards [[positivism]], beginning with the publication of {{lang|de|Kritische Geschichte der Philosophie}} (''Critical History of Philosophy''), he rejects [[Immanuel Kant]]'s separation of [[phenomenon]] from [[noumenon]] and claims that our intellect is capable of grasping the whole reality. This adequacy of thought to things is because the universe contains but one reality, i.e. matter. It is to matter that we must look for the explanation both of conscious and of physical states. But matter is not, in his system, to be understood with the common meaning, but with a deeper sense as the substratum of all conscious and physical existence; and thus the laws of being are identified with the laws of thought. In this idealistic system D\u00fchring finds room for [[teleology]]. The end of [[Nature]], he holds, is the production of a race of conscious beings. From his belief in teleology he is not deterred by the enigma of pain. As a determined optimist, he asserts that pain exists to throw pleasure into conscious relief.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nIn ethics, D\u00fchring follows [[Auguste Comte]] in making sympathy the foundation of morality. In political philosophy, he teaches an ethical [[communism]] and attacks [[Herbert Spencer]]'s principle of [[Social Darwinism]]. In economics, he is best known by his vindication of the American writer [[H. C. Carey]], who attracts him both by his theory of value, which suggests an ultimate harmony of the interests of capitalists and labourers; and also by his doctrine of national political economy, which advocates protection on the ground that the morals and culture of a people are promoted by having its whole system of industry complete within its own borders. His patriotism is fervent, but narrow and exclusive. He idolized [[Frederick the Great]], and denounced [[Jews]], [[Greeks]], and the cosmopolitan [[Goethe]]. His writing has been characterized as clear and incisive, \"though disfigured by arrogance and ill-temper, failings which may be extenuated on the ground of his physical affliction.\"<ref name=EB1911>{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=D\u00fchring, Eugen Karl|volume=8|page=649|first=Henry|last=Sturt|authorlink=Henry Sturt, 1st Baron Alington}}</ref>\n\n== Legacy ==\nHe is chiefly remembered among English-speakers because of [[Engels]]' criticism of his views in {{lang|de|[[Anti-D\u00fchring]]}}: Herr Eugen D\u00fchring's Revolution in Science. Engels wrote his {{lang|de|Anti-D\u00fchring}} in opposition to D\u00fchring's ideas, which had found some disciples among the German [[Social Democrats]]. He is also the most prominent representative of the socialism of that era attacked by Nietzsche in his later works. Most of D\u00fchring's work remains unavailable in English, aside from his work on the [[Jewish question]].<ref>{{cite book|last=D\u00fchring|first=Eugen|title=Eugen D\u00fchring on the Jews|year=1997|publisher=Nineteen Eighty Four Press|location=Brighton, England|isbn=0-906879-31-0|pages=228}}</ref>\n\n\"Heroic materialism\" characterized D\u00fchring's philosophy.

Many scholars<ref>{{cite book|last=Gordis|first=Daniel|title=Israel: A Concise History of a Nation Reborn|year=2016|publisher=Harper Collins Publishers|location=New York, NY|pages=18}}</ref> believe that D\u00fchring's invention of a modern-sounding antisemitism helped persuade [[Theodore Herzl]] that [[Zionism]] was the only answer: {{quote|Herzl acknowledged this over and over in his diaries and correspondence: \"I will fight anti-Semitism in the place it originated\u2014in Germany and in Austria,\" he said in one letter.

The first commencement of this work of darkness was the expulsion of the Jews, and its crowning act the expulsion of the Moors, whereby two millions of the most industrious and well-to-do inhabitants were driven out of Spain with their capital.\" (From List's ''The National System of Political Economy'', p 58.)</ref>\n\n== Thought ==\nHe was \"deeply\" influenced by [[Arthur Schopenhauer|Schopenhauer]] throughout his career<ref>This is according to historian [[Frederick C. Beiser]] in his ''[[Weltschmerz]]: [[Pessimism]] in German Philosophy, 1860-1900'', [[Oxford]]: [[Oxford University Press]], 2018, Chapter 6, \"The Optimism of Eugen D\u00fchring,\" p. 87. \"As a young man D\u00fchring read Schopenhauer, who deeply impressed him. He admired his clarity, rigour and bluntness, and especially his stand against university philosophy. In his opinion, in breadth and depth, Schopenhauer stood head and shoulders above all the [[German Idealism|post-Kantians]]. It was Schopenhauer\u2019s great merit, D\u00fchring believed, to have dragged philosophy out of its scholastic cocoon and to have made it confront the greatest question of them all: to be or not to be. That question was for D\u00fchring nothing less than 'the chief theme of philosophy.' \" (''Der Werth des Lebens'' (1865), p. 1) </ref>. D\u00fchring's opinions changed considerably after his first appearance as a writer. His earlier work, {{lang|de|Nat\u00fcrliche Dialektik}} (''Natural Dialectics''), is entirely in the spirit of [[critical philosophy]]. Later, in his movement towards [[positivism]], beginning with the publication of {{lang|de|Kritische Geschichte der Philosophie}} (''Critical History of Philosophy''), he rejects [[Immanuel Kant]]'s separation of [[phenomenon]] from [[noumenon]] and claims that our intellect is capable of grasping the whole reality. This adequacy of thought to things is because the universe contains but one reality, i.e. matter. It is to matter that we must look for the explanation both of conscious and of physical states. But matter is not, in his system, to be understood with the common meaning, but with a deeper sense as the substratum of all conscious and physical existence; and thus the laws of being are identified with the laws of thought. In this idealistic system D\u00fchring finds room for [[teleology]]. The end of [[Nature]], he holds, is the production of a race of conscious beings. From his belief in teleology he is not deterred by the enigma of pain. As a determined optimist, he asserts that pain exists to throw pleasure into conscious relief.<ref name=EB1911/>\n\nIn ethics, D\u00fchring follows [[Auguste Comte]] in making sympathy the foundation of morality. In political philosophy, he teaches an ethical [[communism]] and attacks [[Herbert Spencer]]'s principle of [[Social Darwinism]]. In economics, he is best known by his vindication of the American writer [[H. C. Carey]], who attracts him both by his theory of value, which suggests an ultimate harmony of the interests of capitalists and labourers; and also by his doctrine of national political economy, which advocates protection on the ground that the morals and culture of a people are promoted by having its whole system of industry complete within its own borders. His patriotism is fervent, but narrow and exclusive. He idolized [[Frederick the Great]], and denounced [[Jews]], [[Greeks]], and the cosmopolitan [[Goethe]]. His writing has been characterized as clear and incisive, \"though disfigured by arrogance and ill-temper, failings which may be extenuated on the ground of his physical affliction.\"<ref name=EB1911>{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=D\u00fchring, Eugen Karl|volume=8|page=649|first=Henry|last=Sturt|authorlink=Henry Sturt, 1st Baron Alington}}</ref>\n\n== Legacy ==\nHe is chiefly remembered among English-speakers because of [[Engels]]' criticism of his views in {{lang|de|[[Anti-D\u00fchring]]}}: Herr Eugen D\u00fchring's Revolution in Science. Engels wrote his {{lang|de|Anti-D\u00fchring}} in opposition to D\u00fchring's ideas, which had found some disciples among the German [[Social Democrats]]. He is also the most prominent representative of the socialism of that era attacked by Nietzsche in his later works. Most of D\u00fchring's work remains unavailable in English, aside from his work on the [[Jewish question]].<ref>{{cite book|last=D\u00fchring|first=Eugen|title=Eugen D\u00fchring on the Jews|year=1997|publisher=Nineteen Eighty Four Press|location=Brighton, England|isbn=0-906879-31-0|pages=228}}</ref>\n\n\"Heroic materialism\" characterized D\u00fchring's philosophy.

Armington and his 5 sons, was a large, respected and profitable operation, when they introduced the Euclid Automatic Rotary Scraper in 1924 - soon followed by the Euclid Wheeler (wheeled) scraper. These earth-moving products were conceived by George's eldest son, Arthur, who envisioned a good future in designing earth-moving equipment, and steered the company into the earth-moving field. The two models of scrapers were successful, and a third model, the Euclid Contractors Special, designed to cope with hard ground, was even more successful.\n\nArthur and his father had built a successful prototype crawler, and tested it on the family farm, but the idea was dropped for reasons unknown. The success of the scrapers led to the formation of the Road Machinery Division, of Euclid Crane and Hoist, in 1926. Big public works construction programs of 1927 and 1928, requiring large excavations, saw further success of the Euclid Road Machinery division.\n\nEuclid produced [[Tractor crawler|crawler]] wagons on tracks (similar to Athey Wagons) known as Euclid Tu-Way haulers. The crawler track speed restriction was seen as a problem, and the next version used steel wheels for improved speed. George Armington Jr was a keen [[hydraulics]] designer, and produced the first hydraulic Euclid dumpers around 1930.\n\n===Great Depression===\nThe [[Great Depression]] did not appear to affect Euclid greatly, and the expansion of the earthmoving portion of the Euclid business, led to the incorporation of the Euclid Road Machinery Co, on July 11, 1931. This company remained a subsidiary of Euclid Armington Corp, until January 1, 1933, when the companies were separated - and Euclid Road Machinery, became a producer of fast, off-road earthmoving haulers.\n\nThe Euclid company produced its first specifically designed, {{convert|7|yd|m}} long, off-road dump truck, the Model 1Z, in January 1934. It was powered by a 100HP [[Waukesha Engine|Waukesha gasoline engine]]. It used a specially designed, extremely heavy duty, Euclid rear [[axle]], fitted with a new 17.5 x 24 tire, which had just been released by the tire industry. Although Mack had produced a {{convert|14|yd|m}} long, heavy duty off-road hauler in 1931 specifically for the Boulder Dam project (the Model AP Super-Duty) - it was basically a beefed-up, road-going, chain-drive AC Bulldog Mack.\n\nThe next Euclid design, was an articulated, tractor/trailer style (in the style of the Caterpillar DW10), bottom dumper. This was known as the Model Z or ZW.\n\n===Company expansion===\nEuclid went on to produce thousands of off-road haulers and scrapers, of improving and larger design and became a large corporation by the early 1950s. In 1953 the Euclid Corporation was purchased by General Motors, in what the leaders of both companies saw as an advantageous deal, with complementary product lines.\nThis deal came about, due to GM's already awakened desire to enter into the earthmoving manufacturing field and the realisation by the Armington family, that a GM takeover would provide capital and design ability that they could only dream about. The GM takeover deal was announced on September 30, 1953, with the official takeover date being January 1, 1954.\n\nArthur Armington had died suddenly in 1937, leading to a stumble in Euclids fortunes - but George Armington died in 1954, at the age of 89, after overseeing the sale of Euclid to GM. Sons Stuart & Everett Armington retired in 1953, and George Jr retired in 1958 - with the youngest son Ray, being the last Armington to retire in 1960, after 7 years as General Manager of GM's Euclid Division.\n\nThe 1950s and 1960s were good years for Euclid Trucks. Euclid produced the industry's first 50-ton, 3 axle dump truck, with twin Cummins power, in 1951. Euclid produced two and three axle dump trucks with capacities up to 105 tons, in this period. Some of the largest three axle units, being used as tractors for even larger end dumps, and bottom dump haulers.\n\n===Antitrust lawsuit===\nIn 1959 the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] under [[United States Attorney General|Attorney General]] [[William P. Rogers]] initiated an [[antitrust]] suit, under the [[Clayton Act]], against General Motors Corporation. It charged that GM was too dominant, and its business methods stifled competition in the off-road hauler and earthmoving market. GM fought the suit for 8 years, finally surrendering in 1968, agreeing to sell the Euclid Division.\n\nAfter the sale of Euclid to [[White Motor Corporation]], GM formed the [[Terex]] brand.<ref>https://contractormag.co.nz/classic-machines/terex-s-35e-scraper/</ref> Under the sale agreement with White, GM was not allowed to produce trucks in competition with White for 4 years &ndash; from July 1, 1968, to July 1, 1972. GM could produce off-road haul trucks in this period, but could not sell them in the US. GM equipment dealers in the US were offered a franchise deal from White to sell the White/Euclid line of trucks for a period of 4 years. The international Euclid dealerships were still owned by GM, thus forcing White to form all-new international dealerships. GM produced haul trucks in the 1968-1972 period that it had developed during its ownership of Euclid from plants in Canada and Scotland, that it had been allowed to keep. These were sold as Terex, but were essentially the same as the Euclid line.\n\nThe Euclid Company lost its prominence after the sale to White, and never achieved the standing that it enjoyed before the GM acquisition.\n\n===Current state===\nAfter the company was purchased by [[Hitachi Construction Machinery (Europe)|Hitachi Construction Machinery Co. Ltd.]] it is now producing a range of models of truck under the Hitachi name (although it is commonly branded as a Euclid, and several components bear the Euclid name). There are two classes of the machines that are currently in production - both are \"rigid dumper\" models (dump trucks with a rigid frame, non-articulated). The smaller construction and quarry trucks (30 ton - 90 ton) are dwarfed by the larger mining trucks in the 140ton - 450ton range.\n\nProduction was moved from [[Euclid, Ohio]], to [[Guelph]] in [[Ontario]], Canada. The trucks are modern and are equipped with mufflers and computer controllers to meet environmental requirements for sound and exhaust emissions.\n\nThere are some trucks currently in use in mines in the US, they can be seen in Canada at [[Fort McMurray]], and throughout [[China]], [[Australia]], [[Africa]], [[Indonesia]] and [[South America]] as well. Although the heady days of American needs for infrastructure have abated, there is still much need for infrastructure and mining.\n\nSmaller construction trucks, of 32 tons and 36 tons capacity, are being built in [[India]] by [[Telcon]], a joint venture between [[Tata Group|Tata]] and Hitachi Construction Machinery Co. Ltd. from [[Japan]].\nThese smaller trucks are of older technology - they were previously manufactured in Poland under license from VME (Volvo Michigan Euclid). The intended market for these older technology construction trucks is [[India]].\n\nWhite sold Euclid, Inc., to Daimler Benz AG of Stuttgart, Germany in August, 1977, and in January 1984, Daimler-Benz sold Euclid to one of Euclid\u2019s former competitors, [[Clark Equipment Company]], and it became part of the Clark Michigan Company, as Clark\u2019s construction machinery division was then called. The following April, Clark formed a 50/50 joint venture with Sweden\u2019s [[Volvo AB]], now known as [[Volvo Construction Equipment]] to manufacture Volvo, Michigan and Euclid construction equipment under the name of VME Group NV. VME underwent several rather confusing divisions amongst its American and European operations, culminating in 1991 in the creation of a VME North Americas unit to handle only the Euclid lines.\n\nIn December 1993, VME North America entered into a joint venture of its own with Japan\u2019s Hitachi Construction Machinery Co. Ltd., called Euclid-Hitachi Heavy Equipment. Hitachi Construction Machinery Co. Ltd., a manufacturer of hydraulic construction machinery like excavators and cranes, gradually increased its share of the joint venture until it owned 100% of the venture in 2000. \nHitachi obtained Euclid to fill the gap which existed in their ability to offer a complete mining package, as mining excavators and dump trucks are usually needed in combination.\n\nEuclid-Hitachi became Hitachi Construction Truck Manufacturing on January 1, 2004, and the famous Euclid green was replaced with Hitachi orange. The Euclid name was phased out by the end of the 2004 calendar year, ending 80 years of the Euclid name on construction machinery.\n\n==Developments==\n[[image:Euclid R60 3.jpg|thumb|A Euclid R60 Dump truck]]\nThe Euclid company of Euclid, OH, was synonymous with off-road haul trucks, and earthmoving equipment such as bottom dumpers, and to a lesser extent, scrapers, in the 1950s. As described in Herbert L. Nicholas' \"Moving the Earth\",<ref>Nichols, Herbert Lownds; Day, David A. ''Moving the Earth: The Workbook of Excavation - Fifth Edition'', (2005) McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc.</ref> now in its 5th edition, Euclid was everywhere.\n\nGM's work on heavy duty [[automatic transmission]]s during the [[Second World War]] had produced the Allison heavy duty automatic in 1945 &mdash; Euclid was the first to use this transmission in heavy duty off-road dump trucks in the late 1940s &mdash; because it met the need for an industrial transmission with huge power capacity, as engine sizes were increasing to the point where transmissions could not cope with the power.\n\nEuclid had pioneered the use of twin engines (Twin-Power) in a bottom dumper (model 50FDT-102W), in November 1948. Their first Twin-Power scraper prototype (model 51FDT-13SH) appeared in February 1949, and production model Twin-Power scrapers were released in 1950 (GM powered model 68FDT-17SH - and the Cummins powered model, 66FDT-16SH). Prior to GM's purchase of Euclid, the engine preferred by Euclid was Cummins diesels, with GM's 2-stroke Detroit Diesel offered as an option. When GM purchased Euclid, it led to dismay at Cummins, because of loss of an important customer. The takeover led to GM engines being the engine of choice, but the Cummins option was still available, although Cummins-engined trucks sold in lower numbers after the GM takeover.\n\nRanging from 10 to 62 ton capacity, these giants roamed strip mines, heavy construction sites and quarries worldwide. Euclid's end dumps reached 210 tons in capacity in the 1980s.\n\nEuclid trucks were usually loaded by cable-operated crawler shovels and draglines of other manufacturers, but Euclid also developed mobile belt loaders to load its bottom dump trucks.\n\nEuclid also pioneered the high speed tractor belly dumper. This combined an off-road tractor (with a fifth wheel) and a very large, up to 100-[[ton]] capacity, belly dump trailer. This machine, descended from bottom dump wagons drawn by crawler tractors, discharged its load through longitudinal gates in the bottom of the trailer. The first such trucks carried 13 cubic yards, but by the early 1960s capacities reached 110 tons.\n\nEuclid also manufactured wheeled tractor scrapers, such as were invented by [[R. G. LeTourneau]] (later to become LeTourneau-Westinghouse, after the purchase of R. G LeTourneau, Inc. by Westinghouse Air Brake Company)<ref>\"The WABCO Archive Wheel Tractor-Scrapers\" {{ISBN|978-0-9871503-0-1}} (Global General Publishing Pty Ltd 2011)</ref> and now almost singularly manufactured by [[Caterpillar Inc.|Caterpillar]]. Euclid's tractor scrapers were powered by the same tractors as their belly dumps. \nEuclid was the first major manufacturer to commercialize the now [[ubiquitous]] articulated rubber tired loader; the mainstay of many heavy equipment manufacturers nowadays, particularly Caterpillar.\n\n[[File:euclid offroad dump truck old.jpg|thumb|alt=Euclid R24 Dump Truck |Euclid R24 Dump Truck]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n* ''Euclid Earth-Moving Equipment 1924-1968'' (Orlemann, Eric C., MBI, 2004);\n* ''Euclid and Terex Earth-Moving Machines'' (Orlemann, Eric C., MBI, 1997)\n* ''The Earthmover Encyclopedia'' (Haddock, Keith, MBI, 2006).\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Euclid haul trucks|Euclid}}\n*[http://www.volvoce.com/constructionequipment/corporate/en-gb/AboutUs/history/products/Rigid%20haulers/Euclid/pages/introduction.aspx Euclid dumpers (at Volvo Construction Equipment)] &ndash; ''includes sub-pages on 22 Euclid models, with photos and technical specs.''\n*[http://www.hcme.com/en/our_company/company_profile/history__1 History of Hitachi Construction Equipment Europe - mentioning acquisition of Euclid]\n\n{{Hitachi}}\n{{General Motors}}\n\n[[Category:Construction equipment manufacturers of the United States]]\n[[Category:Defunct truck manufacturers]]\n[[Category:Dump trucks]]\n[[Category:Haul trucks]]\n[[Category:Defunct companies based in Ohio]]\n[[Category:Euclid, Ohio]]\n[[Category:Vehicle manufacturing companies established in 1924]]\n[[Category:General Motors marques]]\n[[Category:Hitachi]]\n[[Category:Volvo Group]]\n[[Category:1924 establishments in Ohio]]\n", "text_old": "{{Multiple issues|\n{{more footnotes|date=June 2009}}\n{{more citations needed|date=June 2009}}\n}}\n\n[[Image:Chuqui001.jpg|thumb| Euclid truck in use at [[Chuquicamata]] copper mine in 1984]]\n[[File:Kopalnia Winna G\u00f3ra 31.jpg|thumb|right|Euclid truck at a quarry in Poland (2013)]]\nThe '''Euclid Company of Ohio''' was a company specialized in [[heavy equipment]] for [[Earthworks (engineering)|earthmoving]], namely [[dump truck]]s and [[wheel tractor-scraper]]s, that operated from the [[United States of America]] from the 1920s to the 1950s, then it was purchased and converted into a section of [[General Motors]] and later on by [[Hitachi Construction Machinery]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hitachicm.com/global/company/company-profile/company-history/|title=History 1991\u20132015|website=Hitachi.com|accessdate=13 October 2019}}</ref>\n\n== History==\n\n===Founding===\nThe Euclid Company of Ohio specialized in off-road heavy haulers, specifically designed as off-road haulers - as compared to other companies, that modified on-road [[truck]]s for off-road earth-hauling.\n\nThe Euclid Crane and Hoist Co, owned by George A.

Ltd., a manufacturer of hydraulic construction machinery like excavators and cranes, gradually increased its share of the joint venture until it owned 100% of the venture in 2000. \nHitachi obtained Euclid to fill the gap which existed in their ability to offer a complete mining package, as mining excavators and dump trucks are usually needed in combination.\n\nEuclid-Hitachi became Hitachi Construction Truck Manufacturing on January 1, 2004, and the famous Euclid green was replaced with Hitachi orange. The Euclid name was phased out by the end of the 2004 calendar year, ending 80 years of the Euclid name on construction machinery.\n\n==Developments==\n[[image:Euclid R60 3.jpg|thumb|A Euclid R60 Dump truck]]\nThe Euclid company of Euclid, OH, was synonymous with off-road haul trucks, and earthmoving equipment such as bottom dumpers, and to a lesser extent, scrapers, in the 1950s. As described in Herbert L. Nicholas' \"Moving the Earth\",<ref>Nichols, Herbert Lownds; Day, David A. ''Moving the Earth: The Workbook of Excavation - Fifth Edition'', (2005) McGraw-Hill Companies, Inc.</ref> now in its 5th edition, Euclid was everywhere.\n\nGM's work on heavy duty [[automatic transmission]]s during the [[Second World War]] had produced the Allison heavy duty automatic in 1945 &mdash; Euclid was the first to use this transmission in heavy duty off-road dump trucks in the late 1940s &mdash; because it met the need for an industrial transmission with huge power capacity, as engine sizes were increasing to the point where transmissions could not cope with the power.\n\nEuclid had pioneered the use of twin engines (Twin-Power) in a bottom dumper (model 50FDT-102W), in November 1948. Their first Twin-Power scraper prototype (model 51FDT-13SH) appeared in February 1949, and production model Twin-Power scrapers were released in 1950 (GM powered model 68FDT-17SH - and the Cummins powered model, 66FDT-16SH). Prior to GM's purchase of Euclid, the engine preferred by Euclid was Cummins diesels, with GM's 2-stroke Detroit Diesel offered as an option. When GM purchased Euclid, it led to dismay at Cummins, because of loss of an important customer. The takeover led to GM engines being the engine of choice, but the Cummins option was still available, although Cummins-engined trucks sold in lower numbers after the GM takeover.\n\nRanging from 10 to 62 ton capacity, these giants roamed strip mines, heavy construction sites and quarries worldwide. Euclid's end dumps reached 210 tons in capacity in the 1980s.\n\nEuclid trucks were usually loaded by cable-operated crawler shovels and draglines of other manufacturers, but Euclid also developed mobile belt loaders to load its bottom dump trucks.\n\nEuclid also pioneered the high speed tractor belly dumper. This combined an off-road tractor (with a fifth wheel) and a very large, up to 100-[[ton]] capacity, belly dump trailer. This machine, descended from bottom dump wagons drawn by crawler tractors, discharged its load through longitudinal gates in the bottom of the trailer. The first such trucks carried 13 cubic yards, but by the early 1960s capacities reached 110 tons.\n\nEuclid also manufactured wheeled tractor scrapers, such as were invented by [[R. G. LeTourneau]] (later to become LeTourneau-Westinghouse, after the purchase of R. G LeTourneau, Inc. by Westinghouse Air Brake Company)<ref>\"The WABCO Archive Wheel Tractor-Scrapers\" {{ISBN|978-0-9871503-0-1}} (Global General Publishing Pty Ltd 2011)</ref> and now almost singularly manufactured by [[Caterpillar Inc.|Caterpillar]]. Euclid's tractor scrapers were powered by the same tractors as their belly dumps. \nEuclid was the first major manufacturer to commercialize the now [[ubiquitous]] articulated rubber tired loader; the mainstay of many heavy equipment manufacturers nowadays, particularly Caterpillar.\n\n[[File:euclid offroad dump truck old.jpg|thumb|alt=Euclid R24 Dump Truck |Euclid R24 Dump Truck]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n* ''Euclid Earth-Moving Equipment 1924-1968'' (Orlemann, Eric C., MBI, 2004);\n* ''Euclid and Terex Earth-Moving Machines'' (Orlemann, Eric C., MBI, 1997)\n* ''The Earthmover Encyclopedia'' (Haddock, Keith, MBI, 2006).\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Euclid haul trucks|Euclid}}\n*[http://www.volvoce.com/constructionequipment/corporate/en-gb/AboutUs/history/products/Rigid%20haulers/Euclid/pages/introduction.aspx Euclid dumpers (at Volvo Construction Equipment)] &ndash; ''includes sub-pages on 22 Euclid models, with photos and technical specs.''\n*[http://www.hcme.com/en/our_company/company_profile/history__1 History of Hitachi Construction Equipment Europe - mentioning acquisition of Euclid]\n\n{{Hitachi}}\n{{General Motors}}\n\n[[Category:Construction equipment manufacturers of the United States]]\n[[Category:Defunct truck manufacturers]]\n[[Category:Dump trucks]]\n[[Category:Haul trucks]]\n[[Category:Defunct companies based in Ohio]]\n[[Category:Euclid, Ohio]]\n[[Category:Vehicle manufacturing companies established in 1924]]\n[[Category:General Motors marques]]\n[[Category:Hitachi]]\n[[Category:Volvo Group]]\n[[Category:1924 establishments in Ohio]]\n", "name_user": "DannyS712", "label": "safe", "comment": "Fixing the location of periods / full stops", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclid_Trucks"}

The groups are delineated using language, ethnic identity or the [[caste system in Nepal]]. They are categorized by common [[culture]] and [[endogamy]].

According to the 2001 national census, ninety two different living languages are spoken in Nepal (a ninety third category was \"unspecified\"). Based upon the 2011 census, the major languages spoken in Nepal are Nepali , Maithili and Bhojpuri.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cbs.gov.np/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Summary-Nepali.pdf |format=PDF |title=Official Summary of Census |year=2011 |work=Central Bureau of Statistics, Nepal |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121202145804/http://cbs.gov.np/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Summary-Nepali.pdf |archivedate=2 December 2012 }}</ref>\n\nSince Nepal's unification, various indigenous languages have come under threat of extinction as the government of Nepal has marginalized their use through strict policies designed to promote Nepali as the official language. Indigenous languages which have gone extinct or are critically threatened include Byangsi, Chonkha, and Longaba. Since democracy was restored in 1990, however, the government has worked to improve the marginalization of these languages. Tribhuvan University began surveying and recording threatened languages in 2010 and the government intends to use this information to include more languages on the next Nepalese census.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tumbahang|first=Govinda Bahadur|year=2010|title=Marginalization of indigenous languages of Nepal|url=|journal=Contributions to Nepalese Studies|volume=37|pages=69|via=Expanded Academic}}</ref>\n\n==Social status==\n[[File:SunuwarMaleFemale.jpg|thumbnail|[[Sunuwar]], a division of [[Kirati people]]; one of the largest ethnic cluster in Eastern Nepal]]\n[[Pahari people|Pahari]] Hill Hindus of the [[Khas|Khas Gorkha]] tribe ([[Bahun|Brahmin/Bahun]] and [[Chhetri]] castes) and the [[Newar people|Newar ethnicity]] dominated the civil service, the judiciary and upper ranks of the army throughout the [[Kingdom of Nepal|Shah regime]] (1768\u20132008). Nepali was the national language and [[Sanskrit]] became a required school subject. Children who spoke Nepali natively and who were exposed to Sanskrit had much better chances of passing the national examinations at the end of high school, which meant they had better employment prospects and could continue into higher education.\n\nOn the other hand, children who natively spoke local languages of the [[Madhesh]] and [[Hill Region|Hills]], or Tibetan dialects prevailing in the high mountains were at a considerable disadvantage. This history of exclusion coupled with poor prospects for improvement created grievances that encouraged many in ethnic communities such as [[Madhesi people|Madhesi]], [[Tharu people|Tharu]] and [[Kham Magar]] to support the [[Unified Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist)]] and various other armed Maoist opposition groups such as the [[JTMM]] during and after the [[Nepalese Civil War]]. The negotiated end to this war forced King [[Gyanendra of Nepal|Gyanendra]] to abdicate in 2008.\n\nIssues of ethnic and regional equity have tended to dominate the agenda of the new republican government and continue to be divisive. Today, even after the end of a 10-year-old Maoist conflict, the upper caste dominates every field in Nepal. Specifically, Brahmin and Chhetri (Indo-Aryan) have advantages. Although Newars are low in numbers, their urban living habitat gives them a competitive advantage. Thus, Newars are at the top of the Human Development Index. From a [[Gender inequality in Nepal|gender perspective]], Newari women are the most literate and lead in every sector. Brahmin and Chhetri women have experienced less social and economic mobility compared to Newari women.

The groups are delineated using language, ethnic identity or the [[caste system in Nepal]]. They are categorized by common [[culture]] and [[endogamy]]. Endogamy carves out ethnic groups in Nepal.{{cn|date=April 2019}}\n\n==Linguistic groups==\n[[File:Dashain Tika 02.JPG|thumb|[[Khas people]] celebrating [[Dashain]] festival; Khas are the largest ethno-linguistic group in Nepal comprising [[Bahun]], [[Chhetri]], [[Kami (caste)|Kami]], [[Damai]] and other [[Dalit]]s]]\nNepal's diverse linguistic heritage evolved from three major language groups: [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan]], [[Tibeto-Burman languages]], and various [[indigenous language]] isolates. According to the 2001 national census, ninety two different living languages are spoken in Nepal (a ninety third category was \"unspecified\"). Based upon the 2011 census, the major languages spoken in Nepal are Nepali , Maithili and Bhojpuri.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://cbs.gov.np/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Summary-Nepali.pdf |format=PDF |title=Official Summary of Census |year=2011 |work=Central Bureau of Statistics, Nepal |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121202145804/http://cbs.gov.np/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Summary-Nepali.pdf |archivedate=2 December 2012 }}</ref>\n\nSince Nepal's unification, various indigenous languages have come under threat of extinction as the government of Nepal has marginalized their use through strict policies designed to promote Nepali as the official language. Indigenous languages which have gone extinct or are critically threatened include Byangsi, Chonkha, and Longaba. Since democracy was restored in 1990, however, the government has worked to improve the marginalization of these languages. Tribhuvan University began surveying and recording threatened languages in 2010 and the government intends to use this information to include more languages on the next Nepalese census.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Tumbahang|first=Govinda Bahadur|year=2010|title=Marginalization of indigenous languages of Nepal|url=|journal=Contributions to Nepalese Studies|volume=37|pages=69|via=Expanded Academic}}</ref>\n\n==Social status==\n[[File:SunuwarMaleFemale.jpg|thumbnail|[[Sunuwar]], a division of [[Kirati people]]; one of the largest ethnic cluster in Eastern Nepal]]\n[[Pahari people|Pahari]] Hill Hindus of the [[Khas|Khas Gorkha]] tribe ([[Bahun|Brahmin/Bahun]] and [[Chhetri]] castes) and the [[Newar people|Newar ethnicity]] dominated the civil service, the judiciary and upper ranks of the army throughout the [[Kingdom of Nepal|Shah regime]] (1768\u20132008). Nepali was the national language and [[Sanskrit]] became a required school subject. Children who spoke Nepali natively and who were exposed to Sanskrit had much better chances of passing the national examinations at the end of high school, which meant they had better employment prospects and could continue into higher education.\n\nOn the other hand, children who natively spoke local languages of the [[Madhesh]] and [[Hill Region|Hills]], or Tibetan dialects prevailing in the high mountains were at a considerable disadvantage. This history of exclusion coupled with poor prospects for improvement created grievances that encouraged many in ethnic communities such as [[Madhesi people|Madhesi]], [[Tharu people|Tharu]] and [[Kham Magar]] to support the [[Unified Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist)]] and various other armed Maoist opposition groups such as the [[JTMM]] during and after the [[Nepalese Civil War]]. The negotiated end to this war forced King [[Gyanendra of Nepal|Gyanendra]] to abdicate in 2008.\n\nIssues of ethnic and regional equity have tended to dominate the agenda of the new republican government and continue to be divisive. Today, even after the end of a 10-year-old Maoist conflict, the upper caste dominates every field in Nepal. Specifically, Brahmin and Chhetri (Indo-Aryan) have advantages. Although Newars are low in numbers, their urban living habitat gives them a competitive advantage. Thus, Newars are at the top of the Human Development Index. From a [[Gender inequality in Nepal|gender perspective]], Newari women are the most literate and lead in every sector. Brahmin and Chhetri women have experienced less social and economic mobility compared to Newari women. Specifically, Brahmin women experience less equality due to their predominately rural living conditions which deprives them of access to certain educational and healthcare benefits.<ref name=\"OCHA1\">{{cite journal|url=http://www.internal-displacement.org/8025708F004CE90B/(httpDocuments)/B66F206172F49BE4C12572D50030C3F0/$file/OCHA+overview+no+12+April+07.pdf |format=PDF |title=OCHA Nepal \u2013 Situation Overview |volume=Issue 12 |date=April 2007 |publisher=[[OCHA]] |accessdate=2011-05-07 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091113112940/http://www.internal-displacement.org/8025708F004CE90B/(httpDocuments)/B66F206172F49BE4C12572D50030C3F0/$file/OCHA+overview+no+12+April+07.pdf |archivedate=13 November 2009 }}</ref><ref name=\"OCHA2\">{{cite journal|url=http://reliefweb.int/sites/reliefweb.int/files/resources/2E89F2121C2C57A24925733F000F4F21-Full_report.pdf |format=PDF |title=OCHA Nepal \u2013 Situation Overview |volume=Issue 16 |date=July\u2013August 2007 |publisher=[[OCHA]] |accessdate=2011-05-07}}</ref><ref name=\"OCHA3\">{{cite journal|url=http://www.internal-displacement.org/8025708F004CE90B/(httpDocuments)/5CC0BE0C971587F2C1257496004A9B9E/$file/ocha+sitrep+12+july08.pdf |format=PDF |title=OCHA Nepal \u2013 Situation Overview |volume=Issue 30 |date=June\u2013July 2008 |publisher=[[OCHA]] |accessdate=2011-05-07 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100218090410/http://www.internal-displacement.org/8025708F004CE90B/(httpDocuments)/5CC0BE0C971587F2C1257496004A9B9E/$file/ocha+sitrep+12+july08.pdf |archivedate=18 February 2010 }}</ref><ref name=\"Him-ext\">{{cite web|url=http://www.thehimalayantimes.com/fullNews.php?headline=Body+of+murder+victim+found+in+Gulmi&NewsID=266104 |title=Body of murder victim found in Gulmi |publisher=The Himalayan Times online |location=Gulmi |first=Hari |last=Sharma |date=2010-11-18 |accessdate=2011-05-07 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120525142109/http://www.thehimalayantimes.com/fullNews.php?headline=Body+of+murder+victim+found+in+Gulmi&NewsID=266104 |archivedate=25 May 2012 }}</ref><ref name=\"Hatlebakk07\">{{cite web|last=Hatlebakk |first=Magnus |year=2007 |title=Economic and social structures that may explain the recent conflicts in the Terai of Nepal |location=[[Kathmandu]] |publisher=Norwegian Embassy |url=http://www.norway.org.np/NR/rdonlyres/0993F5660B3548A98F819167B4FD596C/72944/http___wwwcmi.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2011-05-08}}</ref>\n\nBahun and Chhetri castes form the historical topmost state elites' circle with the significant majority of leadership in executive, legislative, judicial, constitutional, local administrative bodies, [[bureaucracy]], [[political parties]] and social organizations.

{"title_page": "Invention of radio", "text_new": "{{broader|History of radio}}\n\n[[File:FFU trx Stiff 1904.JPG|thumb|A French ship-to-shore radio station in 1904]]\n\nThe '''invention of radio''' communication, although generally attributed to [[Guglielmo Marconi]]*,(Nikolai Tesla) in the 1890s, spanned many decades, from theoretical underpinnings, through proof of the phenomenon's existence, development of technical means, to its final use in signalling.\n\nThe idea that the wires needed for [[electrical telegraph]]y could be eliminated, creating a [[wireless telegraph]], had been around for a while before radio-based communication. Inventors attempted to build systems based on [[Electrical conductor|electric conduction]], [[electromagnetic induction]], or on their own theoretical ideas. Several inventors/experimenters came across radio waves before they were proven to exist but it was written off as [[electromagnetic induction]] at the time.\n\nThe discovery of [[electromagnetic waves]], including [[radio waves]], by [[Heinrich Rudolf Hertz]] in the 1880s came about after over half a century of theoretical development on the connection between [[electricity]] and [[magnetism]] that started in the early 1800s and culminated in a theory of [[electromagnetism]] developed by [[James Clerk Maxwell]] by 1873, which Hertz finally proved.\n\nThe development of radio waves into a communication medium did not follow immediately afterwards. After their discovery Hertz considered them of little practical value and other experimenters who explored the physical properties of the new phenomenon, such as [[Oliver Lodge]] and [[Jagadish Chandra Bose]], while transmitting radio waves some distance, did not seem to see any value in developing a communication system based on them. In their experiments they did develop [[Electronics|electronic components]] and methods to improve the transmission and detection of electromagnetic waves.\n\nIn the mid 1890s, building on techniques physicists were using to study electromagnetic waves, [[Guglielmo Marconi]] developed the first apparatus for long distance radio communication.<ref>Bondyopadhyay, Prebir K.  (1995) \"[https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/4137304/?tp=&arnumber=4137304 Guglielmo Marconi - The father of long distance radio communication - An engineer's tribute\"], ''25th European Microwave Conference: Volume 2'', pp. 879 - 885</ref> On 23 December 1900, the Canadian inventor [[Reginald A. Fessenden]] became the first person to send audio ([[wireless telephony]]) by means of electromagnetic waves, successfully transmitting over a distance of about 1.6 kilometers, and six years later on [[Christmas Eve]] 1906 he became the first person to make a public radio broadcast.<ref>{{cite web|title=Milestones: First Wireless Radio Broadcast by Reginald A.

These experimenters used the existing theories of the day or novel theories of their own on how wireless signals could be transmitted.\n\nIn April 1872 [[William Henry Ward]] received {{US patent|126356}} for a wireless telegraphy system where he theorized that convection currents in the atmosphere could carry signals like a telegraph wire.<ref>Sterling & O'Dell (2011), page 239</ref> A few months after Ward received his patent, [[Mahlon Loomis]] of [[West Virginia]] received {{US patent|129971}} for a \"wireless telegraph\" in July 1872. The patented system claimed to utilize [[atmospheric electricity]] to eliminate the overhead wire used by the existing telegraph systems. It did not contain diagrams or specific methods and it did not refer to or incorporate any known scientific theory. It was similar to [[William Henry Ward]]'s patent.<ref name=\"CHS-EoF\">Sterling, Christopher H. (ed.)

This Branly showed by placing metal filings in a glass box or tube, and making them part of an ordinary electric circuit. According to the common explanation, when electric waves are set up in the neighborhood of this circuit, electromotive forces are generated in it which appear to bring the filings more closely together, that is, to cohere, and thus their electrical resistance decreases, from which cause this piece of apparatus was termed by [[Sir Oliver Lodge]] a coherer.<ref>Although Dr. Branly used the term ''radio-conductor''.</ref> Hence the receiving instrument, which may be a telegraph relay, that normally would not indicate any sign of current from the small battery, can be operated when electric oscillations are set up.<ref name=\"Maverswireless\">Maver, William Jr. (1904) [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015075085822&view=1up&seq=5 ''Maver's Wireless Telegraphy: Theory and Practice'']</ref> Branly further found that when the filings had once cohered they retained their low resistance until shaken apart, for instance, by tapping on the tube.<ref>United States Naval Institute (1902).

Lodge set up a demonstration on the quasi-optical nature of \"Hertzian waves\" (radio waves) and demonstrated their similarity to light and vision including reflection and transmission.<ref name=\"Sungook Hong 2001, pages 30-32\">Sungook Hong, Wireless: From Marconi's Black-box to the Audion, MIT Press, 2001, pages 30\u201332</ref> Later in June and on 14 August 1894 he did similar experiments, increasing the distance of transmission up to 55 meters.<ref name=\"antiquewireless.org\"/> In these lectures Lodge demonstrated a detector that would become standard in radio work, an improved version of Branly's detector which Lodge dubbed the ''[[coherer]]''. It consisted of a glass tube containing metal filings between two electrodes. When the small electrical charge from waves from an antenna were applied to the electrodes, the metal particles would cling together or \"[[wiktionary:cohere|cohere]]\" causing the device to become conductive allowing the current from a battery to pass through it. In Lodge's setup the slight impulses from the coherer were picked up by a [[mirror galvanometer]] which would deflect a beam of light being projected on it, giving a visual signal that the impulse was received. After receiving a signal the metal filings in the coherer were broken apart or \"decohered\" by a manually operated vibrator or by the vibrations of a bell placed on the table near by that rang every time a transmission was received.<ref name=\"Sungook Hong 2001, pages 30-32\"/> Lodge also demonstrated tuning using a pair of Leyden jars that could be brought into resonance.<ref name=\"W.A.

He then moved his experiments out-of-doors on the family estate near [[Bologna, Italy]], to communicate further. He replaced Hertz's vertical dipole with a vertical wire topped by a metal sheet, with an opposing terminal connected to the ground.

In 1899, Marconi announced his invention of the \"iron-mercury-iron coherer with telephone detector\" in a paper presented at Royal Society, London.\n\nIn May, 1898, communication was established for the [[Lloyd's of London|Corporation of Lloyds]] between [[Ballycastle, County Antrim|Ballycastle]] and the [[Lighthouse]] on [[Rathlin Island]] in the north of Ireland. In July 1898, the Marconi telegraphy was employed to report the results of yacht races at the Kingstown Regatta for the [[Daily Express (Dublin)|Dublin Express]] newspaper. A set of instruments were fitted up in a room at Kingstown, and another on board a steamer, the [[Flying Huntress]]. The aerial conductor on shore was a strip of wire netting attached to a mast {{convert|40|ft|m}} high, and several hundred messages were sent and correctly received during the progress of the races.\n\nAt this time His Majesty [[King Edward VII]], then [[Prince of Wales]], had the misfortune to injure his knee, and was confined on board the royal yacht [[Osltorm]] in [[Cowes Bay]].<ref>Earlier, in 1885, a wired telephonic system was established here also.

The distances covered were small; but as the yacht moved about, on some occasions high hills were interposed so that the aerial wires were overtopped by hundreds of feet, yet this was no obstacle to communication. These demonstrations led the [[Corporation of Trinity House]] to afford an opportunity for testing the system in practice between the [[South Foreland Lighthouse]], near Dover, and the [[East Goodwin Lightship]], on the [[Goodwin Sands]]. This installation was set in operation on December 24, 1898, and proved to be of value. It was shown that when once the apparatus was set up it could be worked by ordinary seamen with very little training.\n\nAt the end of 1898 electric wave telegraphy established by Marconi had demonstrated its utility, especially for communication between [[ship and ship]] and [[ship and shore]].<ref name=\"summary\">A summary of his work on wireless telegraphy up to the beginning of 1899 is given in a paper read by Marconi to the Institution of Electrical Engineers on March 2, 1899.

Fessenden]] began working directly for Thomas Edison at the inventor's new laboratory in [[West Orange, New Jersey]]. Fessenden quickly made major advances, especially in receiver design, as he worked to develop audio reception of signals. The [[United States Weather Bureau]] began, early in 1900, a systematic course of experimentation in wireless telegraphy, employing him as a specialist.<ref name=\"wCSrf\">Sewall (1904) [https://archive.org/details/wirelesstelegra00sewagoog/page/n86 pp. 66\u201371]</ref> Fessenden evolved the [[heterodyne]] principle here where two signals combined to produce a third signal.\n\nIn 1900, construction began on a large radio transmitting alternator. Fessenden, experimenting with a high-frequency [[spark transmitter]], successfully transmitted speech on December 23, 1900, over a distance of about {{convert|1.6|km|mi}}, the ''first audio radio transmission''. Early in 1901 the Weather Bureau officially installed Fessenden at Wier's Point, [[Roanoke Island]], [[North Carolina]], and he made experimental transmissions across water to a station located about {{convert|5|mi|km}} west of [[Cape Hatteras]], the distance between the two stations being almost exactly {{convert|50|mi|km}}.<ref name=\"wCSrf\" /> An alternator of 1&nbsp;kW output at 10 kilohertz was built in 1902. The credit for the development of this machine is due to [[Charles Proteus Steinmetz]], Caryl D. Haskins, [[Ernst Alexanderson]], John T. H. Dempster, Henry Geisenhoner, Adam Stein, Jr., and F. P. Mansbendel.<ref name=\"Transactionsv27p1\" />\n\nIn a paper written by Fessenden in 1902, it was asserted that important advances had been made, one of which was overcoming largely the loss of energy experienced in other systems.  In an interview with a ''[[New York Journal]]'' correspondent, Fessenden stated that in his early apparatus he did not use an air transformer at the sending end, nor a concentric cylinder for emitters and antennae,<ref name=\"wCSrf\" /><ref>Such as were employed by the Marconi Company</ref> and had used capacity, but arranged in a manner entirely different from that in other systems, and that he ''did not'' employ a coherer or any form of imperfect contact.  Fessenden asserted that he had paid particular attention to selective and [[multiplexing|multiplex]] systems, and was well satisfied with the results in that direction.<ref name=\"wCSrf\" /> On August 12, 1902, 13 patents were issued to Fessenden, covering various methods, devices, and systems for signaling without wires.<ref name=\"wCSrf\" /> These patents involved many new principles, the ''chef-d'oeuvre'' of which was a method for [[Distributed-element model|distributing capacity and inductance]] instead of localizing these coefficients of the oscillator as in previous systems.<ref name=\"AFJstone\"/>\n\n[[File:Brant rock radio tower 1910.jpg|thumb|right|[[Brant Rock]] radio tower (1910)]]\n\nBy the summer of 1906, a machine producing [[Low frequency|50 kilohertz]] was installed at the [[Brant Rock]] station, and in the fall of 1906, what was called an [[Alternator|electric alternating dynamo]] was working regularly at 75 kilohertz, with an output of 0.5&nbsp;kW.<ref name=\"Transactionsv27p1\"/> Fessenden<ref>Assisted by H.

Inventors attempted to build systems based on [[Electrical conductor|electric conduction]], [[electromagnetic induction]], or on their own theoretical ideas. Several inventors/experimenters came across radio waves before they were proven to exist but it was written off as [[electromagnetic induction]] at the time.\n\nThe discovery of [[electromagnetic waves]], including [[radio waves]], by [[Heinrich Rudolf Hertz]] in the 1880s came about after over half a century of theoretical development on the connection between [[electricity]] and [[magnetism]] that started in the early 1800s and culminated in a theory of [[electromagnetism]] developed by [[James Clerk Maxwell]] by 1873, which Hertz finally proved.\n\nThe development of radio waves into a communication medium did not follow immediately afterwards. After their discovery Hertz considered them of little practical value and other experimenters who explored the physical properties of the new phenomenon, such as [[Oliver Lodge]] and [[Jagadish Chandra Bose]], while transmitting radio waves some distance, did not seem to see any value in developing a communication system based on them. In their experiments they did develop [[Electronics|electronic components]] and methods to improve the transmission and detection of electromagnetic waves.\n\nIn the mid 1890s, building on techniques physicists were using to study electromagnetic waves, [[Guglielmo Marconi]] developed the first apparatus for long distance radio communication.<ref>Bondyopadhyay, Prebir K.

According to the common explanation, when electric waves are set up in the neighborhood of this circuit, electromotive forces are generated in it which appear to bring the filings more closely together, that is, to cohere, and thus their electrical resistance decreases, from which cause this piece of apparatus was termed by [[Sir Oliver Lodge]] a coherer.<ref>Although Dr. Branly used the term ''radio-conductor''.</ref> Hence the receiving instrument, which may be a telegraph relay, that normally would not indicate any sign of current from the small battery, can be operated when electric oscillations are set up.<ref name=\"Maverswireless\">Maver, William Jr. (1904) [https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015075085822&view=1up&seq=5 ''Maver's Wireless Telegraphy: Theory and Practice'']</ref> Branly further found that when the filings had once cohered they retained their low resistance until shaken apart, for instance, by tapping on the tube.<ref>United States Naval Institute (1902).

Lodge set up a demonstration on the quasi-optical nature of \"Hertzian waves\" (radio waves) and demonstrated their similarity to light and vision including reflection and transmission.<ref name=\"Sungook Hong 2001, pages 30-32\">Sungook Hong, Wireless: From Marconi's Black-box to the Audion, MIT Press, 2001, pages 30\u201332</ref> Later in June and on 14 August 1894 he did similar experiments, increasing the distance of transmission up to 55 meters.<ref name=\"antiquewireless.org\"/> In these lectures Lodge demonstrated a detector that would become standard in radio work, an improved version of Branly's detector which Lodge dubbed the ''[[coherer]]''. It consisted of a glass tube containing metal filings between two electrodes. When the small electrical charge from waves from an antenna were applied to the electrodes, the metal particles would cling together or \"[[wiktionary:cohere|cohere]]\" causing the device to become conductive allowing the current from a battery to pass through it. In Lodge's setup the slight impulses from the coherer were picked up by a [[mirror galvanometer]] which would deflect a beam of light being projected on it, giving a visual signal that the impulse was received. After receiving a signal the metal filings in the coherer were broken apart or \"decohered\" by a manually operated vibrator or by the vibrations of a bell placed on the table near by that rang every time a transmission was received.<ref name=\"Sungook Hong 2001, pages 30-32\"/> Lodge also demonstrated tuning using a pair of Leyden jars that could be brought into resonance.<ref name=\"W.A.

He then moved his experiments out-of-doors on the family estate near [[Bologna, Italy]], to communicate further. He replaced Hertz's vertical dipole with a vertical wire topped by a metal sheet, with an opposing terminal connected to the ground. On the receiver side, Marconi replaced the spark gap with a metal powder coherer, a detector developed by [[Edouard Branly]] and other experimenters. Marconi transmitted radio signals for about {{convert|1.5|mi|km}} at the end of 1895.<ref>Bradford, Henry M.,  [http://www.newscotland1398.net/marconi100/marconi1.html \"Marconi's Three Transatlantic Radio Stations In Cape Breton\"].

The complete specification was filed March 2, 1897. This was Marconi's initial patent for the radio, though it used various earlier techniques of various other experimenters and resembled the instrument demonstrated by others (including Popov). During this time spark-gap wireless telegraphy was widely researched. In July, 1896, Marconi got his invention and new method of telegraphy to the attention of Preece, then engineer-in-chief to the [[British Government]] [[Postal, telegraph and telephone service|Telegraph Service]], who had for the previous twelve years interested himself in the development of wireless telegraphy by the inductive-conductive method.

In 1899, Marconi announced his invention of the \"iron-mercury-iron coherer with telephone detector\" in a paper presented at Royal Society, London.\n\nIn May, 1898, communication was established for the [[Lloyd's of London|Corporation of Lloyds]] between [[Ballycastle, County Antrim|Ballycastle]] and the [[Lighthouse]] on [[Rathlin Island]] in the north of Ireland. In July 1898, the Marconi telegraphy was employed to report the results of yacht races at the Kingstown Regatta for the [[Daily Express (Dublin)|Dublin Express]] newspaper. A set of instruments were fitted up in a room at Kingstown, and another on board a steamer, the [[Flying Huntress]]. The aerial conductor on shore was a strip of wire netting attached to a mast {{convert|40|ft|m}} high, and several hundred messages were sent and correctly received during the progress of the races.\n\nAt this time His Majesty [[King Edward VII]], then [[Prince of Wales]], had the misfortune to injure his knee, and was confined on board the royal yacht [[Osltorm]] in [[Cowes Bay]].<ref>Earlier, in 1885, a wired telephonic system was established here also.

The distances covered were small; but as the yacht moved about, on some occasions high hills were interposed so that the aerial wires were overtopped by hundreds of feet, yet this was no obstacle to communication. These demonstrations led the [[Corporation of Trinity House]] to afford an opportunity for testing the system in practice between the [[South Foreland Lighthouse]], near Dover, and the [[East Goodwin Lightship]], on the [[Goodwin Sands]]. This installation was set in operation on December 24, 1898, and proved to be of value. It was shown that when once the apparatus was set up it could be worked by ordinary seamen with very little training.\n\nAt the end of 1898 electric wave telegraphy established by Marconi had demonstrated its utility, especially for communication between [[ship and ship]] and [[ship and shore]].<ref name=\"summary\">A summary of his work on wireless telegraphy up to the beginning of 1899 is given in a paper read by Marconi to the Institution of Electrical Engineers on March 2, 1899.

Fessenden]] began working directly for Thomas Edison at the inventor's new laboratory in [[West Orange, New Jersey]]. Fessenden quickly made major advances, especially in receiver design, as he worked to develop audio reception of signals. The [[United States Weather Bureau]] began, early in 1900, a systematic course of experimentation in wireless telegraphy, employing him as a specialist.<ref name=\"wCSrf\">Sewall (1904) [https://archive.org/details/wirelesstelegra00sewagoog/page/n86 pp. 66\u201371]</ref> Fessenden evolved the [[heterodyne]] principle here where two signals combined to produce a third signal.\n\nIn 1900, construction began on a large radio transmitting alternator. Fessenden, experimenting with a high-frequency [[spark transmitter]], successfully transmitted speech on December 23, 1900, over a distance of about {{convert|1.6|km|mi}}, the ''first audio radio transmission''. Early in 1901 the Weather Bureau officially installed Fessenden at Wier's Point, [[Roanoke Island]], [[North Carolina]], and he made experimental transmissions across water to a station located about {{convert|5|mi|km}} west of [[Cape Hatteras]], the distance between the two stations being almost exactly {{convert|50|mi|km}}.<ref name=\"wCSrf\" /> An alternator of 1&nbsp;kW output at 10 kilohertz was built in 1902. The credit for the development of this machine is due to [[Charles Proteus Steinmetz]], Caryl D. Haskins, [[Ernst Alexanderson]], John T. H. Dempster, Henry Geisenhoner, Adam Stein, Jr., and F. P. Mansbendel.<ref name=\"Transactionsv27p1\" />\n\nIn a paper written by Fessenden in 1902, it was asserted that important advances had been made, one of which was overcoming largely the loss of energy experienced in other systems.  In an interview with a ''[[New York Journal]]'' correspondent, Fessenden stated that in his early apparatus he did not use an air transformer at the sending end, nor a concentric cylinder for emitters and antennae,<ref name=\"wCSrf\" /><ref>Such as were employed by the Marconi Company</ref> and had used capacity, but arranged in a manner entirely different from that in other systems, and that he ''did not'' employ a coherer or any form of imperfect contact.  Fessenden asserted that he had paid particular attention to selective and [[multiplexing|multiplex]] systems, and was well satisfied with the results in that direction.<ref name=\"wCSrf\" /> On August 12, 1902, 13 patents were issued to Fessenden, covering various methods, devices, and systems for signaling without wires.<ref name=\"wCSrf\" /> These patents involved many new principles, the ''chef-d'oeuvre'' of which was a method for [[Distributed-element model|distributing capacity and inductance]] instead of localizing these coefficients of the oscillator as in previous systems.<ref name=\"AFJstone\"/>\n\n[[File:Brant rock radio tower 1910.jpg|thumb|right|[[Brant Rock]] radio tower (1910)]]\n\nBy the summer of 1906, a machine producing [[Low frequency|50 kilohertz]] was installed at the [[Brant Rock]] station, and in the fall of 1906, what was called an [[Alternator|electric alternating dynamo]] was working regularly at 75 kilohertz, with an output of 0.5&nbsp;kW.<ref name=\"Transactionsv27p1\"/> Fessenden<ref>Assisted by H.

They examined 1:60,000 scale panchromatic aerial photos with a stereoscope to interpret the physical features and the geology of the region prior to making four expeditions into the field to check their observations. On Expedition III they explored the entire Essequibo basin. They travelled separately in two outboard-powered canoes, each team comprising a geologist and five Amerindians. Starting at Kanashen, they canoed up all the major eastward flowing tributaries: the Kuyuwini, Kassikaityu, Kamoa and Sipu rivers, as well as the Chadikar River which on the basis of its north-south trend and a larger flow of water is considered to be the source of the Essiquibo rather than the eastward flowing Sipu River. In his memoirs Richard Johnson records how he had a line cut through the forest to a small hill near the Chodikar headwaters so that he could stand on the border defined by the watershed, and when he told his line-cutting team that they were looking south across the forest into Brazil his foreman disagreed on the basis that \"there are lots of nightclubs in Brazil.\"  After mapping the tributaries the two teams joined forces and travelled down the Essequibo to its confluence with the [[Rupununi]] river at Apoteri.<ref>Berrang\u00e9, J.

They followed the Negro upstream to where it is joined by the Rio Ireng that forms the border between Brazil and [[Guyana]]. After following the Ireng for a few tens of kilometers they hovered about 40 miles across the North Savannas of Guyana to the Rupununi River which they followed to it confluence with the Essequibo River at Apoteri. The Essequibo was then traversed down to its mouth near [[Georgetown, Guyana|Georgetown]].  The primary purpose of the expedition was filming for the [[BBC]] series \"[[The World About Us]]\" with the episode \"The Forbidden Route\" broadcast in November 1971. The secondary purpose was to demonstrate the abilities of a new type of small hovercraft, the [[Cushioncraft CC7]], thereby promoting sales of this British invention. The expedition team comprised  Bob Saunders (BBC producer and team leader), Tommy Tomlinson (CC7 pilot), Jevan Berrang\u00e9 (navigator and logistics consultant), Len Chrisophers (hovercraft engineer), Peter Smith (sound recordist, and Tony Morrison (cameraman). Fuel dumps for the hovercraft were laid down at intervals ahead of the expedition, by boat on the Rio Negro, by plane in the North Savannas and by float-plane on the Essequibo. As there were no reliable maps of the route, navigation in Guyana was done by 1:60,000 scale aerial photographs and by scouting rapids in a motorised inflatable dingy ahead of the CC7. This is the first expedition to travel by river, land, and sea from Manaus to Georgetown. A total distance of about {{convert|1000|mi|km}}.<ref>The World About Us: The Forbidden Route; BBC film archives; First broadcast November 21st, 1971 </ref>\n\n=== 2013 ===\n[[File:Leaving Gunns.jpg|thumb|Leaving Gunns to the unexplored wilderness]]\n[[File:At the source of Essequibo.jpg|left|thumb|The Expedition team at the source of Sipu river]]\nA Guyanese-German expedition in Guyana in April and May 2013 followed the course of the Sipu River to detect the still unknown headwaters of the Essequibo. It was sponsored by the French-German TV Company ARTE and was organized by Duane De Freitas (Rupununi Trails) and the film production team of Marion P\u00f6llmann and Rainer Bergomaz (Blue Paw Artists). The responsible scientist for remote sensing, geodesy and mapping was Prof. Dr. Martin Oczipka from the [[University of Applied Sciences Dresden]] (HTW Dresden). The expedition was only realizable with the support of the Guyanese government and the indigenous tribe of [[Wai-wai people|Wai-Wai-Amerindian]] settling in the very south of Guyana.\n[[File:Bamboo lake.jpg|thumb|close to the source area of Sipu river]]\n[[File:Team at the furthest source of the Essequibo River aka Sipu River. .jpg|thumb|The team at the furthest source of the Essequibo River aka the Sipu River]]\nWith the support of the Wai-Wai, satellite maps, topographic maps, GPS and a small drone, the source valley was discovered in 2013. The coordinate determined by expedition teams in 2013 deviates by approximately 40`, which corresponds to a distance of at least 80&nbsp;km north. This could be caused by calculation errors or other mistakes. Possibly he followed a different branch of the river more in the South of Guyana. To further investigate this, additional research is necessary, preferably in the original reports of Robert Hermann Schomburgk from his expedition in 1837/38. For the accurate determination of the headwaters and their proper classification, further extensive geological and hydrological studies are necessary.\n\n=== 2018 ===\nIn 2018, with the support of the First Lady, [[Sandra Granger]], a group consisting of five [[Wai-wai people|Wai-wai]], two English, one Iranian, and one South African located the furthest source of the Essequibo River. They built upon information and experience from the above 2013 Guyanese German expedition alongside topographical maps, local Wai Wai knowledge, GPS, and machetes to follow the Sipu River to its source. The multinational team 'Running the Essequibo' followed the main channel and investigated tributaries until they reached the watershed. There, 20 metres away from the Brazilian border, they logged what is now acknowledged to be the furthest source of the Essequibo River. \n\nGPS co-ordinates: N1'24.5243, W59'16.5107\n\nThe team then began their world-first descent of the Essequibo River. The team of nine paddled back to Kanashan, aka Gunns Strip, where the Wai Wai members returned home and Romel Shoni and Anthony Shushu joined the expedition. This team, accompanied later further downriver by Fay James ([[Macushi]] people), then paddled remaining distance to the mouth of the Essequibo where it meets the Atlantic Ocean. \n\nThis expedition lasted a total of 10 weeks. \n\nTeam members: [[Laura Bingham]] (expedition leader), [[Ness Knight]], Pip Stewart, Peiman Zekavat (film director), Jon Williams (cameraman), Nereus Chekema, Nigel Isaacs, Jackson (Elijah) Marawanaru, Aron Marawanaru, James Suse, Fay James, Romel Shoni, and Anthony Shushu.<ref>[https://theessequibo.org Expedition website].

Berrang\u00e9 and Dr. Richard L. Johnson made the first topographic and geological maps of Guyana south of latitude 4 degrees north. They examined 1:60,000 scale panchromatic aerial photos with a stereoscope to interpret the physical features and the geology of the region prior to making four expeditions into the field to check their observations. On Expedition III they explored the entire Essequibo basin. They travelled separately in two outboard-powered canoes, each team comprising a geologist and five Amerindians. Starting at Kanashen, they canoed up all the major eastward flowing tributaries: the Kuyuwini, Kassikaityu, Kamoa and Sipu rivers, as well as the Chadikar River which on the basis of its north-south trend and a larger flow of water is considered to be the source of the Essiquibo rather than the eastward flowing Sipu River. In his memoirs Richard Johnson records how he had a line cut through the forest to a small hill near the Chodikar headwaters so that he could stand on the border defined by the watershed, and when he told his line-cutting team that they were looking south across the forest into Brazil his foreman disagreed on the basis that \"there are lots of nightclubs in Brazil.\"  After mapping the tributaries the two teams joined forces and travelled down the Essequibo to its confluence with the [[Rupununi]] river at Apoteri.<ref>Berrang\u00e9, J.

They followed the Negro upstream to where it is joined by the Rio Ireng that forms the border between Brazil and [[Guyana]]. After following the Ireng for a few tens of kilometers they hovered about 40 miles across the North Savannas of Guyana to the Rupununi River which they followed to it confluence with the Essequibo River at Apoteri. The Essequibo was then traversed down to its mouth near [[Georgetown, Guyana|Georgetown]].  The primary purpose of the expedition was filming for the [[BBC]] series \"[[The World About Us]]\" with the episode \"The Forbidden Route\" broadcast in November 1971. The secondary purpose was to demonstrate the abilities of a new type of small hovercraft, the [[Cushioncraft CC7]], thereby promoting sales of this British invention. The expedition team comprised  Bob Saunders (BBC producer and team leader), Tommy Tomlinson (CC7 pilot), Jevan Berrang\u00e9 (navigator and logistics consultant), Len Chrisophers (hovercraft engineer), Peter Smith (sound recordist, and Tony Morrison (cameraman). Fuel dumps for the hovercraft were laid down at intervals ahead of the expedition, by boat on the Rio Negro, by plane in the North Savannas and by float-plane on the Essequibo. As there were no reliable maps of the route, navigation in Guyana was done by 1:60,000 scale aerial photographs and by scouting rapids in a motorised inflatable dingy ahead of the CC7. This is the first expedition to travel by river, land, and sea from Manaus to Georgetown. A total distance of about {{convert|1000|mi|km}}<ref>The World About Us: The Forbidden Route; BBC film archives; First broadcast November 21st, 1971 </ref>.\n\n=== 2013 ===\n[[File:Leaving Gunns.jpg|thumb|Leaving Gunns to the unexplored wilderness]]\n[[File:At the source of Essequibo.jpg|left|thumb|The Expedition team at the source of Sipu river]]\nA Guyanese-German expedition in Guyana in April and May 2013 followed the course of the Sipu River to detect the still unknown headwaters of the Essequibo. It was sponsored by the French-German TV Company ARTE and was organized by Duane De Freitas (Rupununi Trails) and the film production team of Marion P\u00f6llmann and Rainer Bergomaz (Blue Paw Artists). The responsible scientist for remote sensing, geodesy and mapping was Prof. Dr. Martin Oczipka from the [[University of Applied Sciences Dresden]] (HTW Dresden). The expedition was only realizable with the support of the Guyanese government and the indigenous tribe of [[Wai-wai people|Wai-Wai-Amerindian]] settling in the very south of Guyana.\n[[File:Bamboo lake.jpg|thumb|close to the source area of Sipu river]]\n[[File:Team at the furthest source of the Essequibo River aka Sipu River. .jpg|thumb|The team at the furthest source of the Essequibo River aka the Sipu River]]\nWith the support of the Wai-Wai, satellite maps, topographic maps, GPS and a small drone, the source valley was discovered in 2013. The coordinate determined by expedition teams in 2013 deviates by approximately 40`, which corresponds to a distance of at least 80&nbsp;km north. This could be caused by calculation errors or other mistakes. Possibly he followed a different branch of the river more in the South of Guyana. To further investigate this, additional research is necessary, preferably in the original reports of Robert Hermann Schomburgk from his expedition in 1837/38. For the accurate determination of the headwaters and their proper classification, further extensive geological and hydrological studies are necessary.\n\n=== 2018 ===\nIn 2018, with the support of the First Lady, [[Sandra Granger]], a group consisting of five [[Wai-wai people|Wai-wai]], two English, one Iranian, and one South African located the furthest source of the Essequibo River. They built upon information and experience from the above 2013 Guyanese German expedition alongside topographical maps, local Wai Wai knowledge, GPS, and machetes to follow the Sipu River to its source. The multinational team 'Running the Essequibo' followed the main channel and investigated tributaries until they reached the watershed. There, 20 metres away from the Brazilian border, they logged what is now acknowledged to be the furthest source of the Essequibo River. \n\nGPS co-ordinates: N1'24.5243, W59'16.5107\n\nThe team then began their world-first descent of the Essequibo River. The team of nine paddled back to Kanashan, aka Gunns Strip, where the Wai Wai members returned home and Romel Shoni and Anthony Shushu joined the expedition. This team, accompanied later further downriver by Fay James ([[Macushi]] people), then paddled remaining distance to the mouth of the Essequibo where it meets the Atlantic Ocean. \n\nThis expedition lasted a total of 10 weeks. \n\nTeam members: [[Laura Bingham]] (expedition leader), [[Ness Knight]], Pip Stewart, Peiman Zekavat (film director), Jon Williams (cameraman), Nereus Chekema, Nigel Isaacs, Jackson (Elijah) Marawanaru, Aron Marawanaru, James Suse, Fay James, Romel Shoni, and Anthony Shushu.<ref>[https://theessequibo.org Expedition website].
