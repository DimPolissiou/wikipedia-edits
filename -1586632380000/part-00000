He notably avoided the collapse of the League in the aftermath of the [[Pazzi Conspiracy]] and during the [[Siege of Otranto|aborted invasion of Italy]] by the Turks. However, the military campaign of [[Charles VIII of France]] in Italy caused the end of the Italic League and initiated the [[Italian Wars]] between the Valois and the Habsburgs. During the [[High Renaissance]] of the 1500s, Italy was therefore both the main European battleground and the cultural-economic centre of the continent. Popes such as [[Pope Julius II|Julius II]] (1503\u20131513) fought for the control of Italy against foreign monarchs, others such as [[Pope Paul III|Paul III]] (1534\u20131549) preferred to mediate between the European powers in order to secure peace in Italy. In the middle of this conflict, the Medici popes [[Pope Leo X|Leo X]] (1513\u20131521) and [[Pope Clement VII|Clement VII]] (1523\u20131534) opposed the [[Protestant reformation]] and [[Caterina de Medici|advanced the interests of their family]]. The end of the wars ultimately left [[northern Italy]] indirectly subject to the Austrian Habsburgs and [[Southern Italy]] under direct Spanish Habsburg rule.\n\nThe Papacy remained independent and launched the [[Counter-reformation]]. Key events of the period include: the [[Council of Trent]] (1545\u20131563); the excommunication of [[Elizabeth I]] (1570) and the [[Battle of Lepanto]] (1571), both occurring during the pontificate of [[Pope Pius V|Pius V]]; the construction of the [[Gregorian Tower|Gregorian observatory]], the adoption of the [[Gregorian calendar]], and the [[Jesuit China mission]] of [[Matteo Ricci]] under [[Pope Gregory XIII]]; the [[French Wars of Religion]]; the [[Long Turkish War]] and the execution of [[Giordano Bruno]] in 1600, under [[Pope Clement VIII]]; the birth  of the [[Lyncean Academy]] of the [[Papal States]], of which the main figure was [[Galileo Galilei]] (later put [[Galileo affair|on trial]]); the final phases of the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618\u20131648) during the pontificates of [[Pope Urban VIII|Urban VIII]] and [[Pope Innocent X|Innocent X]]; and the formation of the last [[Holy League (1684)|Holy League]] by [[Pope Innocent XI|Innocent XI]] during the [[Great Turkish War]]\n\nThe Italian economy declined during the 1600s and 1700s, as the peninsula was excluded from the rising [[Atlantic slave trade]]. Following the European wars of succession of the 18th century, the south passed to a cadet branch of the Spanish Bourbons and the North fell under the influence of the Habsburg-Lorraine of Austria.

A prominent radical figure was the patriotic journalist [[Giuseppe Mazzini]], member of the secret revolutionary society ''[[Carbonari]]'' and founder of the influential political movement [[Young Italy (historical)|Young Italy]] in the early 1830s, who favoured a unitary republic and advocated a broad nationalist movement.

[[Teano]] was the site of the famous meeting of 26 October 1860  between Giuseppe Garibaldi and [[Victor Emmanuel II of Italy|Victor Emmanuel II]], last King of Sardinia, in which Garibaldi shook Victor Emanuel's hand and hailed him as King of Italy; thus, Garibaldi sacrificed republican hopes for the sake of Italian unity under a monarchy. Cavour agreed to include Garibaldi's Southern Italy allowing it to join the union with the Kingdom of Sardinia in 1860. This allowed the Sardinian government to declare a united Italian kingdom on 17 March 1861.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.thelocal.it/20170317/everything-to-know-about-march-17th-italys-unity-unification-risorgimento-day |title=Everything you need to know about March 17th, Italy's Unity Day |date=17 March 2017|access-date=17 July 2017 |language=en}}</ref> Victor Emmanuel II then became the first king of a united Italy, and the capital was moved from Turin to Florence.\n\nIn 1866, Victor Emmanuel II allied with [[Prussia]] during the [[Austro-Prussian War]], waging the [[Third Italian War of Independence]] which allowed Italy to annexe [[Veneto|Venetia]]. Finally, in 1870, as France abandoned its garrisons in Rome during the disastrous [[Franco-Prussian War]] to keep the large Prussian Army at bay, the Italians rushed to fill the power gap by [[Capture of Rome|taking over the Papal States]]. Italian unification was completed and shortly afterward Italy's capital was moved to Rome.

The Constitutional Law of the Kingdom of Sardinia the [[Statuto Albertino|Albertine Statute]] of 1848, was extended to the whole Kingdom of Italy in 1861, and provided for basic freedoms of the new State, but electoral laws excluded the non-propertied and uneducated classes from voting. The government of the new kingdom took place in a framework of parliamentary constitutional monarchy dominated by liberal forces. As [[Northern Italy]] quickly industrialised, the South and rural areas of the North remained underdeveloped and overpopulated, forcing millions of people to migrate abroad and fuelling a large and influential [[Italian diaspora|diaspora]]. The [[Italian Socialist Party]] constantly increased in strength, challenging the traditional liberal and conservative establishment.\n\n[[File:Vittoriano Altare della Patria 2013-09-16.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|The [[Victor Emmanuel II Monument]] in Rome, a national symbol of Italy celebrating the first king of the unified country, and resting place of the [[Tomb of the Unknown Soldier (Italy)|Unknown Soldier]] since the end of World War I]]\n\nStarting from the last two decades of the 19th century, Italy developed into a [[Italian Empire|colonial power]] by forcing under its rule [[Italian Eritrea|Eritrea]] and [[Italian Somalia|Somalia]] in East Africa, [[Italian Tripolitania|Tripolitania]] and [[Italian Cyrenaica|Cyrenaica]] in North Africa (later unified in the colony of [[Italian Libya|Libya]]) and the [[Italian Dodecanese|Dodecanese]] islands.<ref>(Bosworth (2005), p. 49.)</ref> From 2 November 1899 to 7 September 1901, Italy also participated as part of the [[Eight-Nation Alliance]] forces during the [[Boxer Rebellion]] in China; on 7 September 1901, a [[Italian concession of Tientsin|concession in Tientsin]] was ceded to the country, and on 7 June 1902, the concession was taken into Italian possession and administered by a [[Consul (representative)|consul]]. In 1913, male universal suffrage was adopted. The pre-war period dominated by [[Giovanni Giolitti]], Prime Minister five times between 1892 and 1921, was characterized by the economic, industrial and political-cultural modernization of Italian society.\n\nItaly, nominally allied with the [[German Empire]] and the Empire of [[Austria-Hungary]] in the [[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance]], in 1915 joined the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] into World War I with a [[Treaty of London (1915)|promise]] of substantial territorial gains, that included western [[Inner Carniola]], former [[Austrian Littoral]], [[Dalmatia]] as well as parts of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. The country gave a fundamental contribution to the victory of the conflict as one of the \"[[The Big Four (World War I)|Big Four]]\" top Allied powers. The war was initially inconclusive, as the Italian army got stuck in a long [[trench warfare|attrition war]] in the Alps, making little progress and suffering very heavy losses. However, the reorganization of the army and the conscription of the so-called '''99 Boys'' (''Ragazzi del '99'', all males born in 1899 who were turning 18) led to more effective Italian victories in major battles, such as on [[First Battle of Monte Grappa|Monte Grappa]] and in a series of battles on the [[Battle of Monte Grappa|Piave river]]. Eventually, in October 1918, the Italians launched a massive offensive, culminating in the victory of [[Battle of Vittorio Veneto|Vittorio Veneto]]. The Italian victory<ref>Burgwyn, H.

Under the Peace Treaties of [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Saint-Germain]], [[Treaty of Rapallo, 1920|Rapallo]] and [[Treaty of Rome, 1924|Rome]], Italy gained a permanent seat in the [[League of Nations]]'s executive council and obtained most of the promised territories, but not Dalmatia (except [[Zadar|Zara]]), allowing nationalists to define the victory as \"[[Mutilated victory|mutilated]]\". Moreover, Italy annexed the Hungarian harbour of [[Rijeka|Fiume]], that was not part of territories promised at London but [[Impresa di Fiume|had been occupied]] after the end of the war by [[Gabriele D'Annunzio]].\n\n=== Fascist regime ===\n{{Main|Italian Fascism|Fascist Italy (1922\u20131943)|Military history of Italy during World War II}}\n[[File:Benito Mussolini 1930 (cropped).png|thumb|upright|[[Benito Mussolini]], ''[[duce]]'' of [[Fascist Italy (1922\u20131943)|Fascist Italy]]]]\nThe [[Biennio Rosso|socialist agitations]] that followed the devastation of the Great War, inspired by the [[Russian Revolution]], led to counter-revolution and repression throughout Italy. The liberal establishment, fearing a Soviet-style revolution, started to endorse the small [[National Fascist Party]], led by [[Benito Mussolini]]. In October 1922 the [[Blackshirts]] of the National Fascist Party attempted a [[coup d'\u00e9tat|coup]]  named the \"[[March on Rome]]\" which failed but at the last minute, King [[Victor Emmanuel III]] refused to proclaim a state of siege and appointed Mussolini prime minister. Over the next few years, Mussolini banned all political parties and curtailed personal liberties, thus forming a [[Totalitarianism|dictatorship]]. These actions attracted international attention and eventually inspired similar dictatorships such as [[Nazi Germany]] and [[Francoist Spain]].\n\nIn 1935, Mussolini [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War|invaded Ethiopia]] and founded the [[Italian East Africa]], resulting in an international alienation and leading to Italy's withdrawal from the [[League of Nations]]; Italy [[Pact of Steel|allied with Nazi Germany]] and the [[Tripartite Pact|Empire of Japan]] and strongly supported [[Francisco Franco]] in the [[Spanish civil war]]. In 1939, Italy [[Italian invasion of Albania|annexed Albania]], a ''de facto'' protectorate for decades. Italy entered World War II on 10 June 1940. After initially advancing in [[Italian conquest of British Somaliland|British Somaliland]], [[Italian invasion of Egypt|Egypt]], the [[Balkan Campaign (World War II)|Balkans]] and eastern fronts, the Italians were defeated in East Africa, [[Italian participation in the Eastern Front|Soviet Union]] and [[Second Battle of El Alamein|North Africa]].\n\n[[File:Italy's colonial empire.png|thumb|left|Map of the [[Italian Empire]] at its maximum extent, with colonies in light green and protectorates or occupied areas during [[World War II]] in grey]]\n\nThe [[Armistice of Villa Giusti]], which ended fighting between Italy and Austria-Hungary at the end of World War I, resulted in Italian annexation of neighbouring parts of Yugoslavia. During the interwar period, the fascist Italian government undertook a campaign of [[Italianization|Italianisation]] in the areas it annexed, which suppressed Slavic language, schools, political parties, and cultural institutions.

Mussolini was deposed and arrested by order of King Victor Emmanuel III in co-operation with the majority of the members of the [[Grand Council of Fascism]], which passed a motion of no confidence. On 8 September, Italy signed the [[Armistice of Cassibile]], ending its war with the Allies. The Germans helped by the Italian fascists shortly succeeded in taking control of northern and central Italy. The country remained a [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|battlefield]] for the rest of the war, as the Allies were slowly moving up from the south.\n\nIn the north, the Germans set up the [[Italian Social Republic]] (RSI), a Nazi [[puppet state]] with Mussolini installed as leader after he was [[Gran Sasso raid|rescued]] by German paratroopers. Some Italian troops in the south were organized into the [[Italian Co-belligerent Army]], which fought alongside the Allies for the rest of the war, while other Italian troops, loyal to Mussolini and his RSI, continued to fight alongside the Germans in the [[National Republican Army]]. As result, the country descended into [[Italian Civil War|civil war]]. Also, the post-armistice period saw the rise of a large anti-fascist resistance movement, the ''[[Resistenza]]'', which fought a guerilla war against the German and RSI forces.

In most of the inland northern and central regions, the climate ranges from [[humid subtropical]] to [[humid continental]] and [[oceanic climate|oceanic]]. In particular, the climate of the [[Po valley]] geographical region is mostly continental, with harsh winters and hot summers.<ref>Adriana Rigutti, ''Meteorologia'', Giunti, p. 95, 2009.</ref><ref>Thomas A.

The coastal regions have mild winters and warm and generally dry summers, although lowland valleys can be quite hot in summer. Average winter temperatures vary from {{convert|0|C|lk=on}} on the Alps to\n{{convert|12|C}} in Sicily, so average summer temperatures range from {{convert|20|C}} to over {{convert|25|C}}. Winters can vary widely across the country with lingering cold, foggy and snowy periods in the north and milder, sunnier conditions in the south.

The [[President of Italy]] (''Presidente della Repubblica''), currently [[Sergio Mattarella]] since 2015, is Italy's [[head of state]]. The President is elected for a single seven years mandate by the [[Parliament of Italy]] and some regional voters in [[joint session]]. Italy has a written democratic [[Constitution of Italy|constitution]], resulting from the work of a [[Constituent Assembly of Italy|Constituent Assembly]] formed by the representatives of all the [[anti-fascist]] forces that contributed to the defeat of Nazi and Fascist forces during the [[Italian Civil War|Civil War]].<ref>Smyth, Howard McGaw Italy: From Fascism to the Republic (1943\u20131946) ''The Western Political Quarterly'' vol. 1 no. 3 (pp. 205\u2013222), September 1948.{{jstor|442274}}</ref>\n\n=== Government ===\n{{multiple image\n| align    = right\n| caption_align = center\n| image1   = Presidente Mattarella.jpg\n| width1   = 143\n| caption1 = [[Sergio Mattarella]]<br /><small>[[President of Italy]]<br />since 2015</small>\n| image2   = Giuseppe Conte Official.jpg\n| width2   = 137\n| caption2 = [[Giuseppe Conte]]<br /><small>[[Prime Minister of Italy]]<br />since 2018</small>\n}}\n\nItaly has a parliamentary government based on a mixed [[proportional representation|proportional]] and majoritarian voting system. The parliament is perfectly [[bicameral]]: the two houses, the [[Chamber of Deputies of Italy|Chamber of Deputies]] that meets in [[Palazzo Montecitorio]], and the [[Senate of Italy|Senate of the Republic]] that meets in [[Palazzo Madama]], have the same powers. The Prime Minister, officially [[President of the Council of Ministers of Italy|President of the Council of Ministers]] (''Presidente del Consiglio dei Ministri''), is Italy's [[head of government]]. The Prime Minister and the cabinet are appointed by the President of the Republic of Italy and must pass a vote of confidence in Parliament to come into office. To remain the Prime Minister  has to pass also eventual further votes of confidence or no confidence in Parliament.\n\n[[File:Giuramento Mattarella Montecitorio.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Chamber of Deputies (Italy)|Chamber of Deputies]] is the lower house of Italy.]]\n\nThe prime minister is the President of the [[Council of Ministers of Italy|Council of Ministers]]&nbsp;\u2013 which holds effective executive power&nbsp;\u2013 and he must receive a vote of approval from it to execute most political activities. The office is similar to those in most other [[parliamentary system]]s, but the leader of the Italian government is not authorised to request the dissolution of the [[Parliament of Italy]].\n\nAnother difference with similar offices is that the overall political responsibility for intelligence is vested in the President of the Council of Ministers. By virtue of that, the Prime Minister has exclusive power to: co-ordinate intelligence policies, determining the financial resources and strengthening national cyber security; apply and protect State secrets; authorise agents to carry out operations, in Italy or abroad, in violation of the law.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sicurezzanazionale.gov.it/sisr.nsf/english/about-us.html |title=About us \u2013 Sistema di informazione per la sicurezza della Repubblica |website=www.sicurezzanazionale.gov.it|url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150329090926/http://www.sicurezzanazionale.gov.it/sisr.nsf/english/about-us.html |archivedate=29 March 2015|access-date=19 November 2015}}</ref>\n\nA peculiarity of the [[Italian Parliament]] is the representation given to [[Italian nationality law|Italian citizens]] permanently living abroad: 12 Deputies and 6 Senators elected in four distinct [[Parliament of Italy#Overseas constituency|overseas constituencies]].

During the [[Renaissance]] Italian polymaths such as [[Leonardo da Vinci]] (1452\u20131519), [[Michelangelo]] (1475\u20131564) and [[Leon Battista Alberti]] (1404\u20131472) made important contributions to a variety of fields, including biology, architecture, and engineering. [[Galileo Galilei]] (1564\u20131642), a physicist, mathematician and astronomer, played a major role in the [[Scientific Revolution]]. His achievements include key improvements to the [[telescope]] and consequent astronomical observations, and ultimately the triumph of [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernicanism]] over the [[Ptolemaic model]].\n\nOther astronomers suchs as [[Giovanni Domenico Cassini]] (1625\u20131712) and [[Giovanni Schiaparelli]] (1835\u20131910) made many important discoveries about the [[Solar System]]. In mathematics, [[Joseph Louis Lagrange]] (born Giuseppe Lodovico Lagrangia, 1736\u20131813) was active before leaving Italy. [[Fibonacci]] (c. 1170 \u2013 c. 1250), and [[Gerolamo Cardano]] (1501\u20131576) made fundamental advances in mathematics. [[Luca Pacioli]] established [[accounting]] to the world. Physicist [[Enrico Fermi]] (1901\u20131954), a Nobel prize laureate, led the team in Chicago that developed the [[Chicago Pile-1|first nuclear reactor]] and is also noted for his many other contributions to physics, including the co-development of the [[quantum mechanics|quantum theory]] and was one of the key figures in the creation of the [[nuclear weapon]]. He, [[Emilio G. Segr\u00e8]] (1905\u20131989) who discovered the elements [[technetium]] and [[astatine]], and the [[antiproton]]), [[Bruno Rossi]] (1905\u20131993) a pioneer in Cosmic Rays and X-ray astronomy) and a number of Italian physicists were forced to leave Italy in the 1930s by [[Italian Racial Laws|Fascist laws against Jews]].<ref>Lucia Orlando, \"Physics in the 1930s: Jewish Physicists' Contribution to the Realization of the\" New Tasks\" of Physics in Italy.\" ''Historical studies in the physical and biological sciences'' (1998): 141\u2013181. {{jstor|27757806}}</ref>\n\nOther prominent physicists include: [[Amedeo Avogadro]] (most noted for his contributions to [[molecular theory]], in particular the [[Avogadro's law]] and the [[Avogadro constant]]), [[Evangelista Torricelli]] (inventor of [[barometer]]), [[Alessandro Volta]] (inventor of [[electric battery]]), [[Guglielmo Marconi]] (inventor of [[radio]]), [[Galileo Ferraris]] and [[Antonio Pacinotti]], pioneers of the induction motor, [[Alessandro Cruto]], pioneer of light bulb and [[Innocenzo Manzetti]], eclectic pioneer of auto and robotics, [[Ettore Majorana]] (who discovered the [[Majorana fermion]]s), [[Carlo Rubbia]] (1984 Nobel Prize in Physics for work leading to the discovery of the [[W and Z particles]] at [[CERN]]). [[Antonio Meucci]] is known for developing a voice-communication device which is often credited as the first [[telephone]].<ref>Wheen, Andrew.

Towards the middle of the 13th century, [[Medieval art]] and [[Gothic painting]] became more realistic, with the beginnings of interest in the depiction of volume and perspective in Italy with [[Cimabue]] and then his pupil [[Giotto]]. From Giotto onwards, the treatment of composition by the best painters also became much more free and innovative. The two are considered to be the two great medieval masters of painting in western culture.\n\n[[File:Michelangelo's David 2015.jpg|thumb|left|upright= 0.9|[[Michelangelo]]'s ''[[David (Michelangelo)|David]]'' (1501\u20131504), [[Galleria dell'Accademia]], Florence]]\n\nThe [[Italian Renaissance]] is said by many to be the [[Golden Age (metaphor)|golden age]] of painting; roughly spanning the 14th through the mid-17th centuries with a significant influence also out of the borders of modern Italy. In Italy artists like [[Paolo Uccello]], [[Fra Angelico]], [[Masaccio]], [[Piero della Francesca]], [[Andrea Mantegna]], [[Filippo Lippi]], [[Giorgione]], [[Tintoretto]], [[Sandro Botticelli]], [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Michelangelo Buonarroti]], [[Raphael]], [[Giovanni Bellini]], and [[Titian]] took painting to a higher level through the use of [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]], the study of [[human anatomy]] and proportion, and through their development of an unprecedented refinement in drawing and painting techniques. Michelangelo was an active sculptor from about 1500 to 1520, and his great masterpieces including his ''[[David (Michelangelo)|David]]'', ''[[Piet\u00e0 (Michelangelo)|Piet\u00e0]]'', ''[[Moses (Michelangelo)|Moses]]''. Other prominent Renaissance sculptors include [[Lorenzo Ghiberti]], [[Luca Della Robbia]], [[Donatello]], [[Filippo Brunelleschi]] and [[Andrea del Verrocchio]].\n\nIn the 15th and 16th centuries, the [[High Renaissance]] gave rise to a stylised art known as [[Mannerism]]. In place of the balanced compositions and rational approach to perspective that characterised art at the dawn of the 16th century, the Mannerists sought instability, artifice, and doubt. The unperturbed faces and gestures of [[Piero della Francesca]] and the calm Virgins of Raphael are replaced by the troubled expressions of [[Pontormo]] and the emotional intensity of [[El Greco]].\n[[File:Sandro Botticelli - La nascita di Venere - Google Art Project - edited.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|''[[The Birth of Venus]]'' (1484\u20131486), [[Sandro Botticelli]], [[Uffizi]] Gallery, Florence]]\nIn the 17th century, among the greatest painters of [[Italian Baroque]] are [[Caravaggio]], [[Annibale Carracci]], [[Artemisia Gentileschi]], [[Mattia Preti]], [[Carlo Saraceni]] and [[Bartolomeo Manfredi]]. Subsequently, in the 18th century, [[Italian Rococo art|Italian Rococo]] was mainly inspired by French Rococo, since France was the founding nation of that particular style, with artists such as [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo]] and [[Canaletto]].

In the 20th century, with [[Futurism]], primarily through the works of [[Umberto Boccioni]] and [[Giacomo Balla]], Italy rose again as a seminal country for artistic evolution in painting and sculpture.

The [[theatre of ancient Rome]] was a thriving and diverse art form, ranging from festival performances of street theatre, nude dancing, and acrobatics, to the staging of [[Plautus]]'s broadly appealing situation comedies, to the high-style, verbally elaborate tragedies of [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]]. Although Rome had a native tradition of performance, the [[Hellenization]] of [[Culture of ancient Rome|Roman culture]] in the 3rd century BCE had a profound and energising effect on Roman theatre and encouraged the development of Latin literature of the highest quality for the stage. As with many other literary genres, Roman dramatists was heavily influenced or tended to adapt from the Greek. For example, Seneca's ''[[Phaedra (Seneca)|Phaedra]]'' was based on that of [[Euripides]], and many of the comedies of [[Plautus]] were direct translations of works by [[Menander]].<ref>{{Cite book |title=Theatre and Drama in the Making |last=Gassner |first=John |publisher=Applause Theatre Books |year=1992 |location=New York}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 16th century and on into the 18th century, [[Commedia dell'arte]] was a form of [[improvisational theatre]], and it is still performed today. Travelling troupes of players would set up an outdoor stage and provide amusement in the form of [[juggling]], [[acrobatics]] and, more typically, humorous plays based on a repertoire of established characters with a rough storyline, called ''[[canovaccio]]''.  Plays did not originate from written drama but from scenarios called [[lazzi]], which were loose frameworks that provided the situations, complications, and outcome of the action, around which the actors would improvise. The characters of the ''commedia'' usually represent fixed social types and [[stock character]]s, each of which has a distinct [[Costumes in commedia dell'arte|costume]], such as foolish old men, devious servants, or military officers full of false [[bravery|bravado]].

He notably avoided the collapse of the League in the aftermath of the [[Pazzi Conspiracy]] and during the [[Siege of Otranto|aborted invasion of Italy]] by the Turks. However, the military campaign of [[Charles VIII of France]] in Italy caused the end of the Italic League and initiated the [[Italian Wars]] between the Valois and the Habsburgs. During the [[High Renaissance]] of the 1500s, Italy was therefore both the main European battleground and the cultural-economic centre of the continent. Popes such as [[Pope Julius II|Julius II]] (1503\u20131513) fought for the control of Italy against foreign monarchs, others such as [[Pope Paul III|Paul III]] (1534\u20131549) preferred to mediate between the European powers in order to secure peace in Italy. In the middle of this conflict, the Medici popes [[Pope Leo X|Leo X]] (1513\u20131521) and [[Pope Clement VII|Clement VII]] (1523\u20131534) opposed the [[Protestant reformation]] and [[Caterina de Medici|advanced the interests of their family]]. The end of the wars ultimately left [[northern Italy]] indirectly subject to the Austrian Habsburgs and [[Southern Italy]] under direct Spanish Habsburg rule.\n\nThe Papacy remained independent and launched the [[Counter-reformation]]. Key events of the period include: the [[Council of Trent]] (1545\u20131563); the excommunication of [[Elizabeth I]] (1570) and the [[Battle of Lepanto]] (1571), both occurring during the pontificate of [[Pope Pius V|Pius V]]; the construction of the [[Gregorian Tower|Gregorian observatory]], the adoption of the [[Gregorian calendar]], and the [[Jesuit China mission]] of [[Matteo Ricci]] under [[Pope Gregory XIII]]; the [[French Wars of Religion]]; the [[Long Turkish War]] and the execution of [[Giordano Bruno]] in 1600, under [[Pope Clement VIII]]; the birth  of the [[Lyncean Academy]] of the [[Papal States]], of which the main figure was [[Galileo Galilei]] (later put [[Galileo affair|on trial]]); the final phases of the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618\u20131648) during the pontificates of [[Pope Urban VIII|Urban VIII]] and [[Pope Innocent X|Innocent X]]; and the formation of the last [[Holy League (1684)|Holy League]] by [[Pope Innocent XI|Innocent XI]] during the [[Great Turkish War]]\n\nThe Italian economy declined during the 1600s and 1700s, as the peninsula was excluded from the rising [[Atlantic slave trade]]. Following the European wars of succession of the 18th century, the south passed to a cadet branch of the Spanish Bourbons and the North fell under the influence of the Habsburg-Lorraine of Austria.

A prominent radical figure was the patriotic journalist [[Giuseppe Mazzini]], member of the secret revolutionary society ''[[Carbonari]]'' and founder of the influential political movement [[Young Italy (historical)|Young Italy]] in the early 1830s, who favoured a unitary republic and advocated a broad nationalist movement.

[[Teano]] was the site of the famous meeting of 26 October 1860  between Giuseppe Garibaldi and [[Victor Emmanuel II of Italy|Victor Emmanuel II]], last King of Sardinia, in which Garibaldi shook Victor Emanuel's hand and hailed him as King of Italy; thus, Garibaldi sacrificed republican hopes for the sake of Italian unity under a monarchy. Cavour agreed to include Garibaldi's Southern Italy allowing it to join the union with the Kingdom of Sardinia in 1860. This allowed the Sardinian government to declare a united Italian kingdom on 17 March 1861.<ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.thelocal.it/20170317/everything-to-know-about-march-17th-italys-unity-unification-risorgimento-day |title=Everything you need to know about March 17th, Italy's Unity Day |date=17 March 2017|access-date=17 July 2017 |language=en}}</ref> Victor Emmanuel II then became the first king of a united Italy, and the capital was moved from Turin to Florence.\n\nIn 1866, Victor Emmanuel II allied with [[Prussia]] during the [[Austro-Prussian War]], waging the [[Third Italian War of Independence]] which allowed Italy to annexe [[Veneto|Venetia]]. Finally, in 1870, as France abandoned its garrisons in Rome during the disastrous [[Franco-Prussian War]] to keep the large Prussian Army at bay, the Italians rushed to fill the power gap by [[Capture of Rome|taking over the Papal States]]. Italian unification was completed and shortly afterward Italy's capital was moved to Rome.

The Constitutional Law of the Kingdom of Sardinia the [[Statuto Albertino|Albertine Statute]] of 1848, was extended to the whole Kingdom of Italy in 1861, and provided for basic freedoms of the new State, but electoral laws excluded the non-propertied and uneducated classes from voting. The government of the new kingdom took place in a framework of parliamentary constitutional monarchy dominated by liberal forces. As [[Northern Italy]] quickly industrialised, the South and rural areas of the North remained underdeveloped and overpopulated, forcing millions of people to migrate abroad and fuelling a large and influential [[Italian diaspora|diaspora]]. The [[Italian Socialist Party]] constantly increased in strength, challenging the traditional liberal and conservative establishment.\n\n[[File:Vittoriano Altare della Patria 2013-09-16.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|The [[Victor Emmanuel II Monument]] in Rome, a national symbol of Italy celebrating the first king of the unified country, and resting place of the [[Tomb of the Unknown Soldier (Italy)|Unknown Soldier]] since the end of World War I]]\n\nStarting from the last two decades of the 19th century, Italy developed into a [[Italian Empire|colonial power]] by forcing under its rule [[Italian Eritrea|Eritrea]] and [[Italian Somalia|Somalia]] in East Africa, [[Italian Tripolitania|Tripolitania]] and [[Italian Cyrenaica|Cyrenaica]] in North Africa (later unified in the colony of [[Italian Libya|Libya]]) and the [[Italian Dodecanese|Dodecanese]] islands.<ref>(Bosworth (2005), p. 49.)</ref> From 2 November 1899 to 7 September 1901, Italy also participated as part of the [[Eight-Nation Alliance]] forces during the [[Boxer Rebellion]] in China; on 7 September 1901, a [[Italian concession of Tientsin|concession in Tientsin]] was ceded to the country, and on 7 June 1902, the concession was taken into Italian possession and administered by a [[Consul (representative)|consul]]. In 1913, male universal suffrage was adopted. The pre-war period dominated by [[Giovanni Giolitti]], Prime Minister five times between 1892 and 1921, was characterized by the economic, industrial and political-cultural modernization of Italian society.\n\nItaly, nominally allied with the [[German Empire]] and the Empire of [[Austria-Hungary]] in the [[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance]], in 1915 joined the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] into World War I with a [[Treaty of London (1915)|promise]] of substantial territorial gains, that included western [[Inner Carniola]], former [[Austrian Littoral]], [[Dalmatia]] as well as parts of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. The country gave a fundamental contribution to the victory of the conflict as one of the \"[[The Big Four (World War I)|Big Four]]\" top Allied powers. The war was initially inconclusive, as the Italian army got stuck in a long [[trench warfare|attrition war]] in the Alps, making little progress and suffering very heavy losses. However, the reorganization of the army and the conscription of the so-called '''99 Boys'' (''Ragazzi del '99'', all males born in 1899 who were turning 18) led to more effective Italian victories in major battles, such as on [[First Battle of Monte Grappa|Monte Grappa]] and in a series of battles on the [[Battle of Monte Grappa|Piave river]]. Eventually, in October 1918, the Italians launched a massive offensive, culminating in the victory of [[Battle of Vittorio Veneto|Vittorio Veneto]]. The Italian victory<ref>Burgwyn, H.

Under the Peace Treaties of [[Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)|Saint-Germain]], [[Treaty of Rapallo, 1920|Rapallo]] and [[Treaty of Rome, 1924|Rome]], Italy gained a permanent seat in the [[League of Nations]]'s executive council and obtained most of the promised territories, but not Dalmatia (except [[Zadar|Zara]]), allowing nationalists to define the victory as \"[[Mutilated victory|mutilated]]\". Moreover, Italy annexed the Hungarian harbour of [[Rijeka|Fiume]], that was not part of territories promised at London but [[Impresa di Fiume|had been occupied]] after the end of the war by [[Gabriele D'Annunzio]].\n\n=== Fascist regime ===\n{{Main|Italian Fascism|Fascist Italy (1922\u20131943)|Military history of Italy during World War II}}\n[[File:Benito Mussolini 1930 (cropped).png|thumb|upright|[[Benito Mussolini]], ''[[duce]]'' of [[Fascist Italy (1922\u20131943)|Fascist Italy]]]]\nThe [[Biennio Rosso|socialist agitations]] that followed the devastation of the Great War, inspired by the [[Russian Revolution]], led to counter-revolution and repression throughout Italy. The liberal establishment, fearing a Soviet-style revolution, started to endorse the small [[National Fascist Party]], led by [[Benito Mussolini]]. In October 1922 the [[Blackshirts]] of the National Fascist Party attempted a [[coup d'\u00e9tat|coup]]  named the \"[[March on Rome]]\" which failed but at the last minute, King [[Victor Emmanuel III]] refused to proclaim a state of siege and appointed Mussolini prime minister. Over the next few years, Mussolini banned all political parties and curtailed personal liberties, thus forming a [[Totalitarianism|dictatorship]]. These actions attracted international attention and eventually inspired similar dictatorships such as [[Nazi Germany]] and [[Francoist Spain]].\n\nIn 1935, Mussolini [[Second Italo-Abyssinian War|invaded Ethiopia]] and founded the [[Italian East Africa]], resulting in an international alienation and leading to Italy's withdrawal from the [[League of Nations]]; Italy [[Pact of Steel|allied with Nazi Germany]] and the [[Tripartite Pact|Empire of Japan]] and strongly supported [[Francisco Franco]] in the [[Spanish civil war]]. In 1939, Italy [[Italian invasion of Albania|annexed Albania]], a ''de facto'' protectorate for decades. Italy entered World War II on 10 June 1940. After initially advancing in [[Italian conquest of British Somaliland|British Somaliland]], [[Italian invasion of Egypt|Egypt]], the [[Balkan Campaign (World War II)|Balkans]] and eastern fronts, the Italians were defeated in East Africa, [[Italian participation in the Eastern Front|Soviet Union]] and [[Second Battle of El Alamein|North Africa]].\n\n[[File:Italy's colonial empire.png|thumb|left|Map of the [[Italian Empire]] at its maximum extent, with colonies in light green and protectorates or occupied areas during [[World War II]] in grey]]\n\nThe [[Armistice of Villa Giusti]], which ended fighting between Italy and Austria-Hungary at the end of World War I, resulted in Italian annexation of neighbouring parts of Yugoslavia. During the interwar period, the fascist Italian government undertook a campaign of [[Italianization|Italianisation]] in the areas it annexed, which suppressed Slavic language, schools, political parties, and cultural institutions.

Mussolini was deposed and arrested by order of King Victor Emmanuel III in co-operation with the majority of the members of the [[Grand Council of Fascism]], which passed a motion of no confidence. On 8 September, Italy signed the [[Armistice of Cassibile]], ending its war with the Allies. The Germans helped by the Italian fascists shortly succeeded in taking control of northern and central Italy. The country remained a [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|battlefield]] for the rest of the war, as the Allies were slowly moving up from the south.\n\nIn the north, the Germans set up the [[Italian Social Republic]] (RSI), a Nazi [[puppet state]] with Mussolini installed as leader after he was [[Gran Sasso raid|rescued]] by German paratroopers. Some Italian troops in the south were organized into the [[Italian Co-belligerent Army]], which fought alongside the Allies for the rest of the war, while other Italian troops, loyal to Mussolini and his RSI, continued to fight alongside the Germans in the [[National Republican Army]]. As result, the country descended into [[Italian Civil War|civil war]]. Also, the post-armistice period saw the rise of a large anti-fascist resistance movement, the ''[[Resistenza]]'', which fought a guerilla war against the German and RSI forces.

In most of the inland northern and central regions, the climate ranges from [[humid subtropical]] to [[humid continental]] and [[oceanic climate|oceanic]]. In particular, the climate of the [[Po valley]] geographical region is mostly continental, with harsh winters and hot summers.<ref>Adriana Rigutti, ''Meteorologia'', Giunti, p. 95, 2009.</ref><ref>Thomas A.

The coastal regions have mild winters and warm and generally dry summers, although lowland valleys can be quite hot in summer. Average winter temperatures vary from {{convert|0|C|lk=on}} on the Alps to\n{{convert|12|C}} in Sicily, so average summer temperatures range from {{convert|20|C}} to over {{convert|25|C}}. Winters can vary widely across the country with lingering cold, foggy and snowy periods in the north and milder, sunnier conditions in the south.

The [[President of Italy]] (''Presidente della Repubblica''), currently [[Sergio Mattarella]] since 2015, is Italy's [[head of state]]. The President is elected for a single seven years mandate by the [[Parliament of Italy]] and some regional voters in [[joint session]]. Italy has a written democratic [[Constitution of Italy|constitution]], resulting from the work of a [[Constituent Assembly of Italy|Constituent Assembly]] formed by the representatives of all the [[anti-fascist]] forces that contributed to the defeat of Nazi and Fascist forces during the [[Italian Civil War|Civil War]].<ref>Smyth, Howard McGaw Italy: From Fascism to the Republic (1943\u20131946) ''The Western Political Quarterly'' vol. 1 no. 3 (pp. 205\u2013222), September 1948.{{jstor|442274}}</ref>\n\n=== Government ===\n{{multiple image\n| align    = right\n| caption_align = center\n| image1   = Presidente Mattarella.jpg\n| width1   = 143\n| caption1 = [[Sergio Mattarella]]<br /><small>[[President of Italy]]<br />since 2015</small>\n| image2   = Giuseppe Conte Official.jpg\n| width2   = 137\n| caption2 = [[Giuseppe Conte]]<br /><small>[[Prime Minister of Italy]]<br />since 2018</small>\n}}\n\nItaly has a parliamentary government based on a mixed [[proportional representation|proportional]] and majoritarian voting system. The parliament is perfectly [[bicameral]]: the two houses, the [[Chamber of Deputies of Italy|Chamber of Deputies]] that meets in [[Palazzo Montecitorio]], and the [[Senate of Italy|Senate of the Republic]] that meets in [[Palazzo Madama]], have the same powers. The Prime Minister, officially [[President of the Council of Ministers of Italy|President of the Council of Ministers]] (''Presidente del Consiglio dei Ministri''), is Italy's [[head of government]]. The Prime Minister and the cabinet are appointed by the President of the Republic of Italy and must pass a vote of confidence in Parliament to come into office. To remain the Prime Minister  has to pass also eventual further votes of confidence or no confidence in Parliament.\n\n[[File:Giuramento Mattarella Montecitorio.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Chamber of Deputies (Italy)|Chamber of Deputies]] is the lower house of Italy.]]\n\nThe prime minister is the President of the [[Council of Ministers of Italy|Council of Ministers]]&nbsp;\u2013 which holds effective executive power&nbsp;\u2013 and he must receive a vote of approval from it to execute most political activities. The office is similar to those in most other [[parliamentary system]]s, but the leader of the Italian government is not authorised to request the dissolution of the [[Parliament of Italy]].\n\nAnother difference with similar offices is that the overall political responsibility for intelligence is vested in the President of the Council of Ministers. By virtue of that, the Prime Minister has exclusive power to: co-ordinate intelligence policies, determining the financial resources and strengthening national cyber security; apply and protect State secrets; authorise agents to carry out operations, in Italy or abroad, in violation of the law.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.sicurezzanazionale.gov.it/sisr.nsf/english/about-us.html |title=About us \u2013 Sistema di informazione per la sicurezza della Repubblica |website=www.sicurezzanazionale.gov.it|url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150329090926/http://www.sicurezzanazionale.gov.it/sisr.nsf/english/about-us.html |archivedate=29 March 2015|access-date=19 November 2015}}</ref>\n\nA peculiarity of the [[Italian Parliament]] is the representation given to [[Italian nationality law|Italian citizens]] permanently living abroad: 12 Deputies and 6 Senators elected in four distinct [[Parliament of Italy#Overseas constituency|overseas constituencies]].

During the [[Renaissance]] Italian polymaths such as [[Leonardo da Vinci]] (1452\u20131519), [[Michelangelo]] (1475\u20131564) and [[Leon Battista Alberti]] (1404\u20131472) made important contributions to a variety of fields, including biology, architecture, and engineering. [[Galileo Galilei]] (1564\u20131642), a physicist, mathematician and astronomer, played a major role in the [[Scientific Revolution]]. His achievements include key improvements to the [[telescope]] and consequent astronomical observations, and ultimately the triumph of [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernicanism]] over the [[Ptolemaic model]].\n\nOther astronomers suchs as [[Giovanni Domenico Cassini]] (1625\u20131712) and [[Giovanni Schiaparelli]] (1835\u20131910) made many important discoveries about the [[Solar System]]. In mathematics, [[Joseph Louis Lagrange]] (born Giuseppe Lodovico Lagrangia, 1736\u20131813) was active before leaving Italy. [[Fibonacci]] (c. 1170 \u2013 c. 1250), and [[Gerolamo Cardano]] (1501\u20131576) made fundamental advances in mathematics. [[Luca Pacioli]] established [[accounting]] to the world. Physicist [[Enrico Fermi]] (1901\u20131954), a Nobel prize laureate, led the team in Chicago that developed the [[Chicago Pile-1|first nuclear reactor]] and is also noted for his many other contributions to physics, including the co-development of the [[quantum mechanics|quantum theory]] and was one of the key figures in the creation of the [[nuclear weapon]]. He, [[Emilio G. Segr\u00e8]] (1905\u20131989) who discovered the elements [[technetium]] and [[astatine]], and the [[antiproton]]), [[Bruno Rossi]] (1905\u20131993) a pioneer in Cosmic Rays and X-ray astronomy) and a number of Italian physicists were forced to leave Italy in the 1930s by [[Italian Racial Laws|Fascist laws against Jews]].<ref>Lucia Orlando, \"Physics in the 1930s: Jewish Physicists' Contribution to the Realization of the\" New Tasks\" of Physics in Italy.\" ''Historical studies in the physical and biological sciences'' (1998): 141\u2013181. {{jstor|27757806}}</ref>\n\nOther prominent physicists include: [[Amedeo Avogadro]] (most noted for his contributions to [[molecular theory]], in particular the [[Avogadro's law]] and the [[Avogadro constant]]), [[Evangelista Torricelli]] (inventor of [[barometer]]), [[Alessandro Volta]] (inventor of [[electric battery]]), [[Guglielmo Marconi]] (inventor of [[radio]]), [[Galileo Ferraris]] and [[Antonio Pacinotti]], pioneers of the induction motor, [[Alessandro Cruto]], pioneer of light bulb and [[Innocenzo Manzetti]], eclectic pioneer of auto and robotics, [[Ettore Majorana]] (who discovered the [[Majorana fermion]]s), [[Carlo Rubbia]] (1984 Nobel Prize in Physics for work leading to the discovery of the [[W and Z particles]] at [[CERN]]). [[Antonio Meucci]] is known for developing a voice-communication device which is often credited as the first [[telephone]].<ref>Wheen, Andrew.

Towards the middle of the 13th century, [[Medieval art]] and [[Gothic painting]] became more realistic, with the beginnings of interest in the depiction of volume and perspective in Italy with [[Cimabue]] and then his pupil [[Giotto]]. From Giotto onwards, the treatment of composition by the best painters also became much more free and innovative. The two are considered to be the two great medieval masters of painting in western culture.\n\n[[File:Michelangelo's David 2015.jpg|thumb|left|upright= 0.9|[[Michelangelo]]'s ''[[David (Michelangelo)|David]]'' (1501\u20131504), [[Galleria dell'Accademia]], Florence]]\n\nThe [[Italian Renaissance]] is said by many to be the [[Golden Age (metaphor)|golden age]] of painting; roughly spanning the 14th through the mid-17th centuries with a significant influence also out of the borders of modern Italy. In Italy artists like [[Paolo Uccello]], [[Fra Angelico]], [[Masaccio]], [[Piero della Francesca]], [[Andrea Mantegna]], [[Filippo Lippi]], [[Giorgione]], [[Tintoretto]], [[Sandro Botticelli]], [[Leonardo da Vinci]], [[Michelangelo Buonarroti]], [[Raphael]], [[Giovanni Bellini]], and [[Titian]] took painting to a higher level through the use of [[Perspective (graphical)|perspective]], the study of [[human anatomy]] and proportion, and through their development of an unprecedented refinement in drawing and painting techniques. Michelangelo was an active sculptor from about 1500 to 1520, and his great masterpieces including his ''[[David (Michelangelo)|David]]'', ''[[Piet\u00e0 (Michelangelo)|Piet\u00e0]]'', ''[[Moses (Michelangelo)|Moses]]''. Other prominent Renaissance sculptors include [[Lorenzo Ghiberti]], [[Luca Della Robbia]], [[Donatello]], [[Filippo Brunelleschi]] and [[Andrea del Verrocchio]].\n\nIn the 15th and 16th centuries, the [[High Renaissance]] gave rise to a stylised art known as [[Mannerism]]. In place of the balanced compositions and rational approach to perspective that characterised art at the dawn of the 16th century, the Mannerists sought instability, artifice, and doubt. The unperturbed faces and gestures of [[Piero della Francesca]] and the calm Virgins of Raphael are replaced by the troubled expressions of [[Pontormo]] and the emotional intensity of [[El Greco]].\n[[File:Sandro Botticelli - La nascita di Venere - Google Art Project - edited.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|''[[The Birth of Venus]]'' (1484\u20131486), [[Sandro Botticelli]], [[Uffizi]] Gallery, Florence]]\nIn the 17th century, among the greatest painters of [[Italian Baroque]] are [[Caravaggio]], [[Annibale Carracci]], [[Artemisia Gentileschi]], [[Mattia Preti]], [[Carlo Saraceni]] and [[Bartolomeo Manfredi]]. Subsequently, in the 18th century, [[Italian Rococo art|Italian Rococo]] was mainly inspired by French Rococo, since France was the founding nation of that particular style, with artists such as [[Giovanni Battista Tiepolo]] and [[Canaletto]].

In the 20th century, with [[Futurism]], primarily through the works of [[Umberto Boccioni]] and [[Giacomo Balla]], Italy rose again as a seminal country for artistic evolution in painting and sculpture.

The [[theatre of ancient Rome]] was a thriving and diverse art form, ranging from festival performances of street theatre, nude dancing, and acrobatics, to the staging of [[Plautus]]'s broadly appealing situation comedies, to the high-style, verbally elaborate tragedies of [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]]. Although Rome had a native tradition of performance, the [[Hellenization]] of [[Culture of ancient Rome|Roman culture]] in the 3rd century BCE had a profound and energising effect on Roman theatre and encouraged the development of Latin literature of the highest quality for the stage. As with many other literary genres, Roman dramatists was heavily influenced or tended to adapt from the Greek. For example, Seneca's ''[[Phaedra (Seneca)|Phaedra]]'' was based on that of [[Euripides]], and many of the comedies of [[Plautus]] were direct translations of works by [[Menander]].<ref>{{Cite book |title=Theatre and Drama in the Making |last=Gassner |first=John |publisher=Applause Theatre Books |year=1992 |location=New York}}</ref>\n\nDuring the 16th century and on into the 18th century, [[Commedia dell'arte]] was a form of [[improvisational theatre]], and it is still performed today. Travelling troupes of players would set up an outdoor stage and provide amusement in the form of [[juggling]], [[acrobatics]] and, more typically, humorous plays based on a repertoire of established characters with a rough storyline, called ''[[canovaccio]]''.  Plays did not originate from written drama but from scenarios called [[lazzi]], which were loose frameworks that provided the situations, complications, and outcome of the action, around which the actors would improvise. The characters of the ''commedia'' usually represent fixed social types and [[stock character]]s, each of which has a distinct [[Costumes in commedia dell'arte|costume]], such as foolish old men, devious servants, or military officers full of false [[bravery|bravado]].

During the mid-nineteenth century, the [[Genesee Valley Canal]] was built to link southern markets to the [[Great Lakes]] and [[Mohawk River]]. The county was also served by railroads, which soon superseded the canals in their capacity for carrying freight. Part of the [[Oil Springs Reservation]], controlled by the [[Seneca Nation]], is located in the county.\n\n==History==\nFor centuries, Allegany County was the territory of the [[Seneca people]], at the westernmost nation of the Five Nations of the ''[[Haudenosaunee]]'', a confederacy of [[Iroquoian languages]]-speaking peoples. [[European-American]] permanent settlement did not take place until after the [[American Revolutionary War]] and the forced cession by the Seneca of most of their lands in western New York. New York State sold off the lands cheaply to attract new European-American settlers and agricultural development.\n\nAllegany County was created by the state legislature on April 7, 1806, when [[Genesee County, New York]], was partitioned to set aside some  {{convert|1570|sqmi|km2|sigfig=1}} to the new county. The first County Seat was established at [[Angelica, New York]], where it remained for half a century. It was later moved to [[Belmont, New York|Belmont]], a village located along the [[Genesee River]].<ref>New York. ''Laws of New York; 1806; 29th Session; Chapter 162; Section 1; Page 605.''</ref> On March 11, 1808, the borders were adjusted so that {{convert|230|sqmi|km2|sigfig=2}} of [[Steuben County, New York|Steuben County]] passed to Allegany County,<ref>New York. ''Laws of New York; 1808; 31st Session, Chapter 38; Page 263.''</ref> and {{convert|600|mi|km|sigfig=1}} of Allegany County passed to Genesee County.<ref>New York. ''Laws of New York; 1808; 31st Session; Chapter 40; Sections 1\u20142; Page 266.''</ref> This established the current border between Genesee and Steuben counties, and reduced the size of Allegany County to {{convert|1200|sqmi|km2|sigfig=2}}. On June 12, 1812, the legislature authorized the attachment of [[Cattaraugus County, New York]], to Allegany County for administration reasons, but for practical reasons this action did not take place at that time.<ref>New York. ''Laws of New York; 1812; 35th Session; Chapter 38; Page 263 .''</ref> However, on April 13, 1814, the eastern half of Cattaraugus County was so attached and administered from Belmont.<ref>New York. ''Laws of New York; 1814; 37th Session; Chapter 123; Page 146.''</ref> This attachment was ended on March 28, 1817.<ref>New York. ''Laws of New York; 1816; 40th Session; Chapter 115; Section 1; Page 107.''</ref> With continued settlement through the mid-nineteenth century, the legislature periodically adjusted county borders as new counties were organized in western New York. On April 1, 1846, Allegany County lost {{convert|120|sqmi|km2|sigfig=2}} to [[Wyoming County, New York|Wyoming County]], reducing the size of Allegany County to {{convert|1140|sqmi|km2|sigfig=2}}, and establishing the current border between Allegany and Wyoming counties.<ref>New York. ''Laws of New York; 1846; 69th Session; Chapter 51; Page 53.''</ref> On May 11, 1846, Allegany County lost {{convert|50|sqmi|km2|sigfig=1}} to [[Livingston County, New York|Livingston County]], reducing the total to {{convert|1090|sqmi|km2|sigfig=2}}, and establishing the western portion of the current border with Livingston County.<ref>New York.

Allegany County does not lie along the [[Allegheny River]], as its name would suggest. The highest point in the county is Alma Hill, with an elevation of 2,548 feet above sea level. This is the highest point in the state west of the Catskill Mountains. The highest point of Interstate 86 is located in the Town of West Almond with an elevation of 2,110 feet. This is also believed to be the highest point of any interstate in the New York. The County is unique from a watershed perspective as it is providing water to three major watersheds of North America: The eastern part near Alfred has Canacadea Creek that goes into the Canisteo River, Susquehanna River and eventually to Chesapeake Bay.\n\nThe [[Genesee River]] bisects the county from south to north, flowing north out of the County through Letchworth State Park with its three waterfalls on to Rochester over three more waterfalls to its mouth on Lake Ontario and then on to the St. Lawrence River and Atlantic Ocean.  The southwestern part of the County flows into the Allegheny River that flows into the Ohio and then to the Mississippi River basin to the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nIn June 1972 the remnants of [[Hurricane Agnes]] stalled over the area, dropping more than {{convert|20|in|mm}} of rain. Flooding took place in the valley communities of Wellsville, Belmont, Belfast, and others in the county.\n\nLong a necessary transportation waterway for the Seneca and other Native Americans, and successive European-American settlers, since the late 20th century, the Genesee River has been extremely popular with canoeists. The river is also favored by fishermen as it abounds in [[smallmouth bass]], [[trout]] and [[panfish]].\n\n===Adjacent counties===\n* [[Livingston County, New York|Livingston County]] \u2013 northeast\n* [[Steuben County, New York|Steuben County]] \u2013 east\n* [[Potter County, Pennsylvania|Potter County]], [[Pennsylvania]] \u2013 southeast\n* [[McKean County, Pennsylvania|McKean County]], [[Pennsylvania]] \u2013 southwest\n* [[Cattaraugus County, New York|Cattaraugus County]] \u2013 west\n* [[Wyoming County, New York|Wyoming County]] \u2013 northwest\n\n===Major highways===\n* [[File:I-86.svg|20px]] [[Interstate 86 (east)|Interstate 86]] (Southern Tier Expressway)\n* [[File:NY-17.svg|20px]] [[New York State Route 17]] (Southern Tier Expressway)\n* [[File:NY-19.svg|20px]] [[New York State Route 19]]\n* [[File:NY-21.svg|20px]] [[New York State Route 21]]\n* [[File:NY-305.svg|25px]] [[New York State Route 305]]\n* [[File:NY-417.svg|25px]] [[New York State Route 417]]\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1810= 1942\n|1820= 9330\n|1830= 26276\n|1840= 40975\n|1850= 37808\n|1860= 41881\n|1870= 40814\n|1880= 41810\n|1890= 43240\n|1900= 41501\n|1910= 41412\n|1920= 36842\n|1930= 38025\n|1940= 39681\n|1950= 43784\n|1960= 43978\n|1970= 46458\n|1980= 51742\n|1990= 50470\n|2000= 49927\n|2010= 48946\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=46430\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=December 20, 2019}}</ref>\n|align-fn=center\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html |title=U.S. Decennial Census |publisher=United States Census Bureau |accessdate=January 3, 2015 }}</ref><br />1790-1960<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mapserver.lib.virginia.edu|title=Historical Census Browser|publisher=University of Virginia Library|accessdate=January 3, 2015}}</ref> 1900-1990<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/population/cencounts/ny190090.txt|title=Population of Counties by Decennial Census: 1900 to 1990|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=January 3, 2015}}</ref><br />1990-2000<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/population/www/cen2000/briefs/phc-t4/tables/tab02.pdf|title=Census 2000 PHC-T-4.

During the mid-nineteenth century, the [[Genesee Valley Canal]] was built to link southern markets to the [[Great Lakes]] and [[Mohawk River]]. The county was also served by railroads, which soon superseded the canals in their capacity for carrying freight. Part of the [[Oil Springs Reservation]], controlled by the [[Seneca Nation]], is located in the county.\n\n==History==\nFor centuries, Allegany County was the territory of the [[Seneca people]], at the westernmost nation of the Five Nations of the ''[[Haudenosaunee]]'', a confederacy of [[Iroquoian languages]]-speaking peoples. [[European-American]] permanent settlement did not take place until after the [[American Revolutionary War]] and the forced cession by the Seneca of most of their lands in western New York. New York State sold off the lands cheaply to attract new European-American settlers and agricultural development.\n\nAllegany County was created by the state legislature on April 7, 1806, when [[Genesee County, New York]], was partitioned to set aside some  {{convert|1570|sqmi|km2|sigfig=1}} to the new county. The first County Seat was established at [[Angelica, New York]], where it remained for half a century. It was later moved to [[Belmont, New York|Belmont]], a village located along the [[Genesee River]].<ref>New York.

''Laws of New York; 1812; 35th Session; Chapter 38; Page 263 .''</ref> However, on April 13, 1814, the eastern half of Cattaraugus County was so attached and administered from Belmont.<ref>New York.

Allegany County does not lie along the [[Allegheny River]], as its name would suggest. The highest point in the county is Alma Hill, with an elevation of 2,548 feet above sea level. This is the highest point in the state west of the Catskill Mountains. The highest point of Interstate 86 is located in the Town of West Almond with an elevation of 2,110 feet. This is also believed to be the highest point of any interstate in the New York. The County is unique from a watershed perspective as it is providing water to three major watersheds of North America: The eastern part near Alfred has Canacadea Creek that goes into the Canisteo River, Susquehanna River and eventually to Chesapeake Bay.\n\nThe [[Genesee River]] bisects the county from south to north, flowing north out of the County through Letchworth State Park with its three waterfalls on to Rochester over three more waterfalls to its mouth on Lake Ontario and then on to the St. Lawrence River and Atlantic Ocean.  The southwestern part of the County flows into the Allegheny River that flows into the Ohio and then to the Mississippi River basin to the Gulf of Mexico.\n\nIn June 1972 the remnants of [[Hurricane Agnes]] stalled over the area, dropping more than {{convert|20|in|mm}} of rain. Flooding took place in the valley communities of Wellsville, Belmont, Belfast, and others in the county.\n\nLong a necessary transportation waterway for the Seneca and other Native Americans, and successive European-American settlers, since the late 20th century, the Genesee River has been extremely popular with canoeists. The river is also favored by fishermen as it abounds in [[smallmouth bass]], [[trout]] and [[panfish]].\n\n===Adjacent counties===\n* [[Livingston County, New York|Livingston County]] \u2013 northeast\n* [[Steuben County, New York|Steuben County]] \u2013 east\n* [[Potter County, Pennsylvania|Potter County]], [[Pennsylvania]] \u2013 southeast\n* [[McKean County, Pennsylvania|McKean County]], [[Pennsylvania]] \u2013 southwest\n* [[Cattaraugus County, New York|Cattaraugus County]] \u2013 west\n* [[Wyoming County, New York|Wyoming County]] \u2013 northwest\n\n===Major highways===\n* [[File:I-86.svg|20px]] [[Interstate 86 (east)|Interstate 86]] (Southern Tier Expressway)\n* [[File:NY-17.svg|20px]] [[New York State Route 17]] (Southern Tier Expressway)\n* [[File:NY-19.svg|20px]] [[New York State Route 19]]\n* [[File:NY-21.svg|20px]] [[New York State Route 21]]\n* [[File:NY-305.svg|25px]] [[New York State Route 305]]\n* [[File:NY-417.svg|25px]] [[New York State Route 417]]\n\n==Demographics==\n{{US Census population\n|1810= 1942\n|1820= 9330\n|1830= 26276\n|1840= 40975\n|1850= 37808\n|1860= 41881\n|1870= 40814\n|1880= 41810\n|1890= 43240\n|1900= 41501\n|1910= 41412\n|1920= 36842\n|1930= 38025\n|1940= 39681\n|1950= 43784\n|1960= 43978\n|1970= 46458\n|1980= 51742\n|1990= 50470\n|2000= 49927\n|2010= 48946\n|estyear=2018\n|estimate=46430\n|estref=<ref name=\"USCensusEst2018\">{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/popest/data/tables.2018.html|title=Population and Housing Unit Estimates|accessdate=December 20, 2019}}</ref>\n|align-fn=center\n|footnote=U.S. Decennial Census<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/decennial-census.html |title=U.S. Decennial Census |publisher=United States Census Bureau |accessdate=January 3, 2015 }}</ref><br />1790-1960<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mapserver.lib.virginia.edu|title=Historical Census Browser|publisher=University of Virginia Library|accessdate=January 3, 2015}}</ref> 1900-1990<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/population/cencounts/ny190090.txt|title=Population of Counties by Decennial Census: 1900 to 1990|publisher=United States Census Bureau|accessdate=January 3, 2015}}</ref><br />1990-2000<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/population/www/cen2000/briefs/phc-t4/tables/tab02.pdf|title=Census 2000 PHC-T-4.

This theme has become one of the predominant qualities of his work.<ref name=\"CollisPage 149\">Collis (1996), page 149.</ref>\n\nHis lyrics show an influence of the visionary poets [[William Blake]] and [[W.

The words may often be prosaic, and so can hardly be poetry.\"<ref name=\"CollisPage12\">Collis (1996), page 10.</ref>\n\nMorrison has described his songwriting method by remarking that: \"I write from a different place.

This theme has become one of the predominant qualities of his work.<ref name=\"CollisPage 149\">Collis (1996), page 149.</ref>\n\nHis lyrics show an influence of the visionary poets [[William Blake]] and [[W.

The words may often be prosaic, and so can hardly be poetry.\"<ref name=\"CollisPage12\">Collis (1996), page 10.</ref>\n\nMorrison has described his songwriting method by remarking that: \"I write from a different place.

This area is considered the [[urheimat]] of the Balts.]]\n===Origins===\nThe Balts or Baltic peoples, defined as speakers of one of the [[Baltic languages]], a branch of the Indo-European language family, are descended from a group of Indo-European tribes who settled the area between the lower [[Vistula]] and southeast shore of the [[Baltic Sea]] and upper [[Daugava]] and [[Dnieper]] rivers. Because the thousands of lakes and swamps in this area contributed to the Balts' geographical isolation, the Baltic languages retain a number of conservative or archaic features.\n\nSome of the major authorities on Balts, such as [[Kazimieras B\u016bga]], [[Max Vasmer]], [[Vladimir Toporov]] and [[Oleg Trubachyov]],{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} in conducting etymological studies of eastern European river names, were able to identify in certain regions names of specifically Baltic provenance, which most likely indicate where the Balts lived in prehistoric times. This information is summarized and synthesized by [[Marija Gimbutas]] in ''The Balts'' (1963) to obtain a likely proto-Baltic homeland. Its borders are approximately: from a line on the [[Pomerania]]n coast eastward to include or nearly include the present-day sites of [[Berlin]], [[Warsaw]], [[Kiev]], and [[Kursk]], northward through [[Moscow]] to the River Berzha, westward in an irregular line to the coast of the [[Gulf of Riga]], north of [[Riga]].\n\n===Proto-history===\n[[File:Baltic cultures 600-200 BC SVG.svg|thumb|275px|right|Baltic archaeological cultures in the Iron Age from 600 BC to 200 BC\n{{legend|#4E9A06|[[Sambians|Sambian]]-Nothangian group}}\n{{legend|#73D216|Western Masurian group ([[Galindians]]?)}}\n{{legend|#8AE234|Eastern Masurian group ([[Yotvingians]])}}\n{{legend|#729FCF|Lower Neman and West-Latvian group ([[Curonians]])}}\n{{legend|#FCAF3E|Brushed Pottery culture}}\n{{legend|#F57900|[[Milograd culture]]}}\n{{legend|#CE5C00|Plain-Pottery culture, AKA Dnepr-Dvina culture}}\n{{legend|#EDD400|[[Pomeranian culture]]}}\n{{legend|#FCE94F|Bell-shaped burials group}}]]\nThe area of Baltic habitation shrank due to assimilation by other groups, and invasions. According to one of the theories which has gained considerable traction over the years, one of the western Baltic tribes, the [[Galindians]], [[Galindae]], or Goliad, migrated to the area around modern day Moscow, Russia around the 4th century AD.<ref>[https://www.academia.edu/37147068/%D0%91%D0%B0%D0%BB%D1%82%D1%8B_%D0%B2_%D0%BC%D0%B8%D0%B3%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%86%D0%B8%D1%8F%D1%85_%D0%92%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B3%D0%BE_%D0%BF%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B5%D1%81%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%8F_%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B4%D0%BE%D0%B2._%D0%93%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B4%D1%8B_%D0%98%D1%81%D1%82%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B8%D1%87%D0%B5%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%B9_%D1%84%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%BC%D0%B0%D1%82_3-4_2017._%D0%A1._95-124 Tarasov I. The balts in the Migration Period. P. I. Galindians, pp. 96, 100-112.]</ref>\n\nOver time the Balts became differentiated into Western and Eastern Balts. In the 5th century AD parts of the eastern Baltic coast began to be settled by the ancestors of the Western Balts: [[Old Prussians|Brus/Pr\u016bsa]] (\"Old Prussians\"), [[Sudovians]]/[[Jotvingians]], [[Scalvians]], [[Nadruvians]], and [[Curonians]]. The Eastern Balts, including the hypothesised [[Dniepr Balts]], were living in modern-day Belarus, Ukraine and Russia.\n\n[[Germanic peoples]] lived to the west of the Baltic homelands; by the first century AD, the [[Goths]] had stabilized their kingdom from the mouth of the Vistula, south to [[Dacia]]. As Roman domination collapsed in the first half of the first millennium CE in Northern and Eastern Europe, large migrations of the Balts occurred \u2014 first, the [[Galindae]] or [[Galindians]] towards the east, and later, Eastern Balts towards the west. In the seventh century, Slavic tribes from the Volga regions appeared. By the 13th and 14th centuries, they reached the general area that the present-day Balts and Belarusians inhabit. Many other Eastern and Southern Balts either assimilated with other Balts, or Slavs in the 4th\u20137th centuries and were gradually slavicized.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}\n\n===Middle Ages===\nIn the 12th and the 13th centuries, internal struggles, as well as invasions by [[Ruthenians]] and [[Poles]] and later the expansion of the [[Teutonic Order]] resulted in an almost complete annihilation of the Galindians, Curonians, and Yotvingians.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} Gradually Old Prussians became [[Germanization|Germanized]] or some Lithuanized during period from the 15th to the 17th centuries, especially after the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] in [[Prussia]].{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} The cultures of the Lithuanians and Latgalians/Latvians survived and became the ancestors of the populations of the modern countries of [[Latvia]] and [[Lithuania]].\n\nOld Prussian was closely related to the other extinct Western [[Baltic language]]s, [[Curonian language|Curonian]], [[Galindian language|Galindian]] and [[Sudovian language|Sudovian]]. It is more distantly related to the surviving Eastern [[Baltic language]]s, [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] and [[Latvian language|Latvian]].

They were gradually Christianized as a result of the [[Northern Crusades]] of the [[Middle Ages]]. Baltic peoples such as the [[Latvian mythology|Latvians]], [[Lithuanian mythology|Lithuanians]] and [[Old Prussians|Old Prussians]] had their distinct mythologies. The Lithuanians have close historic ties to [[Poland]], and many of them are therefore [[Roman Catholic]]. The [[Latvians]] have close historic ties of [[Northern Germany]] and [[Scandinavia]], and many of them are therefore [[Lutheranism|Lutherans]]. [[Irreligion]] is widespread. In recent times, the Baltic religion has been revived in [[Baltic neopaganism]].\n\n==Genetics==\n{{See also|Kunda culture#Genetics|Narva culture#Genetics|Pit\u2013Comb Ware culture#Genetics|Zvejnieki burial ground#Archaeogenetics}}\nRecent genetic research show that the eastern Baltic in the [[Mesolithic]] was inhabited primarily by [[Western Hunter-Gatherer]]s (WHGs).{{sfn|Saag|2017}} Their paternal haplogroups were mostly types of [[Haplogroup I-M438|I2a]] and [[Haplogroup R1b|R1b]], while their maternal haplogroups were mostly types of [[Haplogroup U (mtDNA)#Haplogroup U5|U5]], [[Haplogroup U (mtDNA)#Haplogroup U4|U4]] and [[Haplogroup U (mtDNA)#Haplogroup U2|U2]].{{sfn|Mathieson|2018}} These people carried a high frequency of the derived [[E3 ubiquitin ligase HERC2|HERC2]] allele which codes for light [[eye color]], and increased frequency of the derived alleles for [[Sodium/potassium/calcium exchanger 5|SLC45A2]] and [[Membrane-associated transporter protein|SLC24A5]], which codes for [[light skin]].{{sfn|Mittnik|2018}}\n\nDuring the [[Neolithic]], increasing admixture from [[Eastern Hunter-Gatherer]]s (EHGs) is detected. The paternal haplogroups of EHGs was mostly types of R1b and [[Haplogroup R1a|R1a]], while their maternal haplogroups appears to have been almost exclusively types of U5, U4, and U2. Baltic hunter-gatherers still displayed a slightly larger amount of WHG ancestry than [[Scandinavian Hunter-Gatherer]]s (SHGs). WHG ancestry in the Baltic was particularly high among hunter-gatherers in Latvia and Lithuania.{{sfn|Mittnik|2018}} Unlike other parts of Europe, the hunter-gatherers of the eastern Baltic do not appear to have mixed much with [[Early European Farmers]] (EEFs) arriving from [[Anatolia]].{{sfn|Jones|2017}} \n\n[[File:Baltic Tribes c 1200.svg|thumb|275px|right|Baltic tribes before the coming of the [[Teutonic Order]] (ca. 1200 AD).

This area is considered the [[urheimat]] of the Balts.]]\n===Origins===\nThe Balts or Baltic peoples, defined as speakers of one of the [[Baltic languages]], a branch of the Indo-European language family, are descended from a group of Indo-European tribes who settled the area between the lower [[Vistula]] and southeast shore of the [[Baltic Sea]] and upper [[Daugava]] and [[Dnieper]] rivers. Because the thousands of lakes and swamps in this area contributed to the Balts' geographical isolation, the Baltic languages retain a number of conservative or archaic features.\n\nSome of the major authorities on Balts, such as [[Kazimieras B\u016bga]], [[Max Vasmer]], [[Vladimir Toporov]] and [[Oleg Trubachyov]],{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} in conducting etymological studies of eastern European river names, were able to identify in certain regions names of specifically Baltic provenance, which most likely indicate where the Balts lived in prehistoric times. This information is summarized and synthesized by [[Marija Gimbutas]] in ''The Balts'' (1963) to obtain a likely proto-Baltic homeland. Its borders are approximately: from a line on the [[Pomerania]]n coast eastward to include or nearly include the present-day sites of [[Berlin]], [[Warsaw]], [[Kiev]], and [[Kursk]], northward through [[Moscow]] to the River Berzha, westward in an irregular line to the coast of the [[Gulf of Riga]], north of [[Riga]].\n\n===Proto-history===\n[[File:Baltic cultures 600-200 BC SVG.svg|thumb|275px|right|Baltic archaeological cultures in the Iron Age from 600 BC to 200 BC\n{{legend|#4E9A06|[[Sambians|Sambian]]-Nothangian group}}\n{{legend|#73D216|Western Masurian group ([[Galindians]]?)}}\n{{legend|#8AE234|Eastern Masurian group ([[Yotvingians]])}}\n{{legend|#729FCF|Lower Neman and West-Latvian group ([[Curonians]])}}\n{{legend|#FCAF3E|Brushed Pottery culture}}\n{{legend|#F57900|[[Milograd culture]]}}\n{{legend|#CE5C00|Plain-Pottery culture, AKA Dnepr-Dvina culture}}\n{{legend|#EDD400|[[Pomeranian culture]]}}\n{{legend|#FCE94F|Bell-shaped burials group}}]]\nThe area of Baltic habitation shrank due to assimilation by other groups, and invasions. According to one of the theories which has gained considerable traction over the years, one of the western Baltic tribes, the [[Galindians]], [[Galindae]], or Goliad, migrated to the area around modern day Moscow, Russia around the 4th century AD.<ref>[https://www.academia.edu/37147068/%D0%91%D0%B0%D0%BB%D1%82%D1%8B_%D0%B2_%D0%BC%D0%B8%D0%B3%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%86%D0%B8%D1%8F%D1%85_%D0%92%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B3%D0%BE_%D0%BF%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B5%D1%81%D0%B5%D0%BB%D0%B5%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%8F_%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B4%D0%BE%D0%B2._%D0%93%D0%B0%D0%BB%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B4%D1%8B_%D0%98%D1%81%D1%82%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B8%D1%87%D0%B5%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%B8%D0%B9_%D1%84%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%BC%D0%B0%D1%82_3-4_2017._%D0%A1._95-124 Tarasov I. The balts in the Migration Period. P. I. Galindians, pp. 96, 100-112.]</ref>\n\nOver time the Balts became differentiated into Western and Eastern Balts. In the 5th century AD parts of the eastern Baltic coast began to be settled by the ancestors of the Western Balts: [[Old Prussians|Brus/Pr\u016bsa]] (\"Old Prussians\"), [[Sudovians]]/[[Jotvingians]], [[Scalvians]], [[Nadruvians]], and [[Curonians]]. The Eastern Balts, including the hypothesised [[Dniepr Balts]], were living in modern-day Belarus, Ukraine and Russia.\n\n[[Germanic peoples]] lived to the west of the Baltic homelands; by the first century AD, the [[Goths]] had stabilized their kingdom from the mouth of the Vistula, south to [[Dacia]]. As Roman domination collapsed in the first half of the first millennium CE in Northern and Eastern Europe, large migrations of the Balts occurred \u2014 first, the [[Galindae]] or [[Galindians]] towards the east, and later, Eastern Balts towards the west. In the seventh century, Slavic tribes from the Volga regions appeared. By the 13th and 14th centuries, they reached the general area that the present-day Balts and Belarusians inhabit. Many other Eastern and Southern Balts either assimilated with other Balts, or Slavs in the 4th\u20137th centuries and were gradually slavicized.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}\n\n===Middle Ages===\nIn the 12th and the 13th centuries, internal struggles, as well as invasions by [[Ruthenians]] and [[Poles]] and later the expansion of the [[Teutonic Order]] resulted in an almost complete annihilation of the Galindians, Curonians, and Yotvingians.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} Gradually Old Prussians became [[Germanization|Germanized]] or some Lithuanized during period from the 15th to the 17th centuries, especially after the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]] in [[Prussia]].{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} The cultures of the Lithuanians and Latgalians/Latvians survived and became the ancestors of the populations of the modern countries of [[Latvia]] and [[Lithuania]].\n\nOld Prussian was closely related to the other extinct Western [[Baltic language]]s, [[Curonian language|Curonian]], [[Galindian language|Galindian]] and [[Sudovian language|Sudovian]]. It is more distantly related to the surviving Eastern [[Baltic language]]s, [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] and [[Latvian language|Latvian]].

They were gradually Christianized as a result of the [[Northern Crusades]] of the [[Middle Ages]]. Baltic peoples such as the [[Latvian mythology|Latvians]], [[Lithuanian mythology|Lithuanians]] and [[Old Prussians|Old Prussians]] had their distinct mythologies. The Lithuanians have close historic ties to [[Poland]], and many of them are therefore [[Roman Catholic]]. The [[Latvians]] have close historic ties of [[Northern Germany]] and [[Scandinavia]], and many of them are therefore [[Lutheranism|Lutherans]]. [[Irreligion]] is widespread. In recent times, the Baltic religion has been revived in [[Baltic neopaganism]].\n\n==Genetics==\n{{See also|Kunda culture#Genetics|Narva culture#Genetics|Pit\u2013Comb Ware culture#Genetics|Zvejnieki burial ground#Archaeogenetics}}\nRecent genetic research show that the eastern Baltic in the [[Mesolithic]] was inhabited primarily by [[Western Hunter-Gatherer]]s (WHGs).{{sfn|Saag|2017}} Their paternal haplogroups were mostly types of [[Haplogroup I-M438|I2a]] and [[Haplogroup R1b|R1b]], while their maternal haplogroups were mostly types of [[Haplogroup U (mtDNA)#Haplogroup U5|U5]], [[Haplogroup U (mtDNA)#Haplogroup U4|U4]] and [[Haplogroup U (mtDNA)#Haplogroup U2|U2]].{{sfn|Mathieson|2018}} These people carried a high frequency of the derived [[E3 ubiquitin ligase HERC2|HERC2]] allele which codes for light [[eye color]], and increased frequency of the derived alleles for [[Sodium/potassium/calcium exchanger 5|SLC45A2]] and [[Membrane-associated transporter protein|SLC24A5]], which codes for [[light skin]].{{sfn|Mittnik|2018}}\n\nDuring the [[Neolithic]], increasing admixture from [[Eastern Hunter-Gatherer]]s (EHGs) is detected. The paternal haplogroups of EHGs was mostly types of R1b and [[Haplogroup R1a|R1a]], while their maternal haplogroups appears to have been almost exclusively types of U5, U4, and U2. Baltic hunter-gatherers still displayed a slightly larger amount of WHG ancestry than [[Scandinavian Hunter-Gatherer]]s (SHGs).

The mount's highest point, Baxian Tower ({{zh|c=\u62d4\u4ed9\u53f0}}), rises to a height of {{convert|3750|m|ft|abbr=on}} and is the tallest in the [[Qinling Mountains|Qinling Range]], as well as the watershed between the [[Han River (Yangtze River tributary)|Han River]] and [[Wei River]]. Mount Taibai is also the highest mountain in Eastern China.\n\n== History ==\nDuring the reign of the legendary, morally perfect [[Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors|Three Sovereigns]] (c. 2852\u20132070 {{sc|BC}}) Mount Taibai was called Mountain of Rich Goods ([[Pinyin language|pinyin:]] ''Dun Wu Sh\u0101n''). During the [[Xia dynasty|Xia Dynasty]] (c. 2070\u20131600 {{sc|BC}}) it was known as Mount Tai Yi, referring to the brightest star in [[Chinese astrology]] with all other stars orbiting around it. In [[Taoism]], Tai Yi is a supreme deity and the mountain its physical representation. Furthermore, Tai Yi symbolises [[Taiji (philosophy)|Tai Ji]], the god who stands for balance and harmony. It was Tai Ji who gave birth to everything and therefore occupies a prominent place in Taoism. The [[Shui Jing Zhu]] records: \"During the time of [[Emperor Wu of Han]], a [[Temple (Chinese)|Daoist temple]] already existed on Mount Taibai that was dedicated to Gu Chun, a man recorded in the [[Lie Xian Zhuan]] ({{zh|c=\u5217\u4ed9\u4f20}}).\" The [[Tang Dynasty]] work Lu Yi Ji ({{zh|c=\u9304\u7570\u8a18}}) says: \"The Essence of the [[Venus|Golden Star]] fell upon the west of [[South Central China|Zhongnan]]'s main peak, and thus it was titled Taibai Mountain.\" Here, the spirit of the Golden Star metamorphosed into magnificent white jade. Ever since, the mountain has been known as Taibai Shan, literally Great (''T\u00e0i'') White (''B\u00e1i'') Mountain (''Sh\u0101n'') and Taibai being an ancient Chinese name for the planet [[Venus]]. The name Mount Taibai also refers to the permanent snow covering the summit of what is the highest peak in the [[Qinling Range|Qinling range]].The great poet [[Li Bai]] wrote in his ''gufeng'' poem: \"How vast is great Taibai / The Stars across its slopes arrayed / From Heaven it stands three hundred ''[[Li (unit)|li]]'' / From Mortal Earth so far away.\"\n\n== Grotto-Heaven ==\nHello there..Taoists believe that the sacred mountains are interconnected via an underground network of dong tien, or [[grotto-heavens]], with ''dong'' meaning \"to penetrate something\" and ''tien'' referring to heaven. Going back as far as the fourth century, grotto-heavens were places where heaven and earth touched. By entering a grotto-heaven you penetrate deep within the mountain and arrive in the world of immortals: you enter \"the beyond within\". Mount Taibai has dozens of grotto-heaven. One of the grotto-heavens is called Place of Charm and Beauty ([[Pinyin language|pinyin:]] ''Bieyou Dong Tien''). Bieyou also refers to a celebrated poem \"Question and Answer in the Mountain\" by the great poet [[Li Bai|Li bai]]: \"You ask me why do I dwell in these green mountains / But I smile without a reply, only an easy mind / The river flows away silently / Bearing the fallen peach blossoms / Here is another world, but not the world of man.\" Peach blossoms refers to the legendary Peach Blossom Valley where deep in the mountains, in \"a different world\", happy people (immortals) live who know nothing of our existence.\n\nIn 1933 [[Yu Youren]], senior statesman of the Chinese Nationalist Party, poet and calligrapher, visited the Place of Charm and Beauty and wrote many poems there, including one carved into a rock which can still be seen today, right next to the grotto-heaven: \"Sleeping Buddha is nice / Once asleep all troubles are gone / I want to come and sleep here / But who will look after the country.\"\n\n== Three gods of Mount Taibai ==\n[[Sacred Mountains of China|Sacred Mountains]] each have their own god or several gods and Mount Taibai is no exception. Chinese gods are often historical figures, such as [[Laozi|Lao Z]]<nowiki/>i, who are elevated to gods first through their popularity amongst ordinary folks and then by the ruling emperor. Stories about the origin of the three gods of Mount Taibai therefore go back a long way. The oldest tale is about a man from Li Yang by the name of Gu Chun, meaning \u2018Spring Valley\u2019, who lived deep inside the forests of Mount Taibai during the [[Han dynasty|Han Dynasty]] (206 BC\u2013220 AD). When he died, his family buried him but during the night his body got up and they saw him leave. Local residents thus believed that he was the god of Mount Taibai and built a temple for him, calling it Taibai (and sometimes Gu Chun) Temple. More recent stories talk of not just one but three Taibai gods because, during the [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan Dynasty]] (1271\u20131368), there were three lakes on Taibai Shan. These lakes were revered for their water and cooling effect and were represented by the three Taibai gods, who were known as Ku Ji (Relieving the Suffering), Hui Min (Benefiting the People) and Ling Ying (Enlightening Answers). Local residents, however, called the three gods Da A Fu (The Great Fortune), Er A Fu (The Second Fortune) and San A Fu (The Third Fortune). But according to poet and politician [[Yu Youren]], the three Taibai gods are Yao, Shun and Yu, or the three demi-gods Earth, Heaven and Water from Chinese legend. And according to the old master [[Ren Fa Rong]], the three Taibai gods are Bo Yi, Shu Qi and Zhou Ben from the [[Shang dynasty|Shang Dynasty]] (17th\u201311th century BC). Bo Yi and Shu Qi were two princes of the [[Kingdom of Gu Zhu]] and Zhou Ben was a general. The king made Shu Qi the crown prince even though Shu Qi was only the third son and Bo Yi the eldest. After the old king died, Shu Qi asked Bo Yi to be the new king but Bo Yi said: \"We shouldn\u2019t resist our father\u2019s will,\" and ran away to Mount Taibai. Shu Qi did not think it was appropriate for him to succeed to the throne since tradition dictated that the throne should be inherited by the oldest son. He therefore gave the throne to the middle son, Ya Ping, and ran after Bo Yi to Mount Taibai. When the [[Zhou dynasty|Zhou Dynasty]] overthrew the Shang Dynasty, the two brothers believed it was not right for a vassal lord such as the duke of Zhou to snatch the kingdom from its lawful ruler. Having been told that \"all under heaven now belongs to the Zhou king\", they refused ever to eat again and so starved to death on Mount Taibai . Zhou Ben, the general, chose the same fate. Learning of their deaths, the wise minister of the Zhou Dynasty, Jiang Ziya, made the three men local gods of Mount Taibai for their great virtue and sense of righteousness. Others claim that the third god is not Zhou Ben but [[Li Bai]], the famous poet. During the [[Qing dynasty|Qing Dynasty]] of the 18th century, the province of [[Shaanxi]] requested approval from the emperor to incorporate the Taibai gods into official provincial celebrations. This did not come about immediately. In 1774, the 39th year of the [[Qianlong Emperor|Qianlong emperor]], Shaanxi province again asked for consent and this time it was granted. As a result, the Taibai gods\u2014previously ranked as mere dukes\u2014acquired the official title of king.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\n== Tiejia Temple ==\nHalfway Mount Taibai, at approximately 1500m (6,000&nbsp;ft), stands the [[Tiejia Temple|Tiejia Taoist Ecology Temple]]. On the exact spot where one can today find the Tiejia Taoist Ecology Temple once stood the old Tiejiashu Temple, hidden amongst the foliage of age-old trees. The Tiejiashu Temple was built at the time of the Han Dynasty (206 BC\u2013220) and remained there until the Cultural Revolution. It was one of the oldest temples dedicated to the gods of Mount Taibai and the first temple on the route taken by pilgrims along the south side of the mountain. Next to the Tiejia Taoist Ecology Temple stand the Ecology Education Center. Respect for nature has always been deeply rooted in Taoist thought and is crucial to China in the present era of ecological crisis. Through the Ecology Education Center, the Taoist monks of the Tiejia Taoist Ecology Temple would be able to organize meetings and training programs designed to help people think in terms of sustainability, not only local visitors but also monks from other temples.\n\n== Nature reserve ==\n\nIn 1965 Mount Taibai became the center of a new Nature Preserve covering the surrounding 56,325 [[hectares]], with the purpose of protecting its [[warm temperate zone]] ecosystem. Mount Taibai has warm temperate, [[temperateness|temperate]], cool temperate, and [[alpine climate|alpine]] climate. The flora and fauna of Taibai are quite diverse, with species from both northern and southern Chinese environments uniquely coexisting in the region.\n\nThe base of the mountain is composed of stone covered by yellow [[loess]] soil, while the middle elevations of the mountain are covered with hardy trees and spectacular rocky outcrops. The higher elevations of the mountain contain glacial remnants, [[cirque]], peaks, [[aulacogen]], and [[moraine]], all of which have proven of great use toward geological research.\n\n== Environment ==\n\nFlora from both the sub-tropical and warm temperate climates inhabit areas of Taibai. Due to the mountain's rapid rises in elevation, plants from the middle temperate climate and alpine climates are also found in the same areas. Within the Nature Preserve's borders more than 1,700 different types of [[Spermatophyte|seed-bearing plants]] are found, comprising approximately 60% of the flora in the [[Qinling]] Range. Among the flora are found many second- and third-tier protected Chinese species, such as Chuan-Guo Vine, ''[[Eucommia]]'', ''[[Kingdonia]]'', ''[[Dipteronia sinensis]]'', ''[[Cercidiphyllum japonicum]]'', ''[[Euptelea pleiosperma]]'', ''[[Acer miaotaiense]]'', ''[[Trochodendraceae]]'', ''[[Sinowilsonia]]'', Taibai Rainbow (''Larix chinensis''), Qinling Crow's Head (''Aconitum liouii''), Chinese Hemlock, ''Populus purdomii'', ''[[Circaeasteraceae]]'', and Purple-Speckled Peony (''Paeonia rockii''), and others. About 40 types of animals inhabit the area, as well as 230 species of birds and several species of amphibians.\n\nMount Taibai National Forest Park is located within the borders of Tanggu in [[Mei County, Shaanxi]].\n\n[[File:Taibai-Dadian-Shan-3x.jpg|700px|thumb|left|Birds-eye panorama, taken from the Bodhisattva Temple at 2300m.]]\n[[File:TaiBai-Doumugong-WC.jpg|700px|thumb|left|A panorama in the heart of Taibai (with small hut in the center), taken from Doumu Palace, elev. 2900m.]]\n{{Clear|left}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- insert external urls or websites -->\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Taibai}}\n[[Category:Mountains of Shaanxi]]\n[[Category:History of Shaanxi]]\n[[Category:Highest points of Chinese provinces]]\n", "text_old": "{{Infobox mountain\n| name = Mount Taibai\n| other_name =\n| photo = TaibaiShanNFP.JPG\n| photo_caption =\n| elevation_m = 3750\n| elevation_ref = <ref name=\"peaklist\">{{cite web|url=http://www.peaklist.org/WWlists/ultras/china4.html|title=China IV - Central and Eastern China, Taiwan and Korea|publisher=Peaklist.org|accessdate=2014-08-27}}</ref><ref name=\"peakbagger\">{{cite peakbagger|pid=10697|name=Taibai Shan, China|accessdate=2014-08-27}}</ref>\n| prominence_m = 2232\n| prominence_ref = <ref name=\"peaklist\"/>\n| listing = [[Ultra prominent peak|Ultra]]\n| map = China\n| map_caption = China\n| map_size = 270\n| label_position = right\n| location = [[Shaanxi Province|Shaanxi]], [[China]]\n| range = [[Qinling Mountains|Qinling Range]]\n| coordinates = {{coord|33|57|18|N|107|45|48|E|type:mountain_scale:100000|format=dms|display=inline,title}}\n| coordinates_ref = <ref name=\"peaklist\"/>\n| first_ascent =\n| easiest_route =\n}}\n\n'''Mount Taibai''' ({{zh|c=\u592a\u767d\u5c71|p=T\u00e0ib\u00e1i Sh\u0101n}}) is a mountain located on the border between [[Mei County, Shaanxi|Mei]], [[Taibai County|Taibai]] and [[Zhouzhi County|Zhouzhi]] counties in the south west of [[Shaanxi Province]], [[China]]. The mount's highest point, Baxian Tower ({{zh|c=\u62d4\u4ed9\u53f0}}), rises to a height of {{convert|3750|m|ft|abbr=on}} and is the tallest in the [[Qinling Mountains|Qinling Range]], as well as the watershed between the [[Han River (Yangtze River tributary)|Han River]] and [[Wei River]]. Mount Taibai is also the highest mountain in Eastern China.\n\n== History ==\nDuring the reign of the legendary, morally perfect [[Three Sovereigns and Five Emperors|Three Sovereigns]] (c. 2852\u20132070 {{sc|BC}}) Mount Taibai was called Mountain of Rich Goods ([[Pinyin language|pinyin:]] ''Dun Wu Sh\u0101n''). During the [[Xia dynasty|Xia Dynasty]] (c. 2070\u20131600 {{sc|BC}}) it was known as Mount Tai Yi, referring to the brightest star in [[Chinese astrology]] with all other stars orbiting around it. In [[Taoism]], Tai Yi is a supreme deity and the mountain its physical representation. Furthermore, Tai Yi symbolises [[Taiji (philosophy)|Tai Ji]], the god who stands for balance and harmony. It was Tai Ji who gave birth to everything and therefore occupies a prominent place in Taoism. The [[Shui Jing Zhu]] records: \"During the time of [[Emperor Wu of Han]], a [[Temple (Chinese)|Daoist temple]] already existed on Mount Taibai that was dedicated to Gu Chun, a man recorded in the [[Lie Xian Zhuan]] ({{zh|c=\u5217\u4ed9\u4f20}}).\" The [[Tang Dynasty]] work Lu Yi Ji ({{zh|c=\u9304\u7570\u8a18}}) says: \"The Essence of the [[Venus|Golden Star]] fell upon the west of [[South Central China|Zhongnan]]'s main peak, and thus it was titled Taibai Mountain.\" Here, the spirit of the Golden Star metamorphosed into magnificent white jade. Ever since, the mountain has been known as Taibai Shan, literally Great (''T\u00e0i'') White (''B\u00e1i'') Mountain (''Sh\u0101n'') and Taibai being an ancient Chinese name for the planet [[Venus]]. The name Mount Taibai also refers to the permanent snow covering the summit of what is the highest peak in the [[Qinling Range|Qinling range]].The great poet [[Li Bai]] wrote in his ''gufeng'' poem: \"How vast is great Taibai / The Stars across its slopes arrayed / From Heaven it stands three hundred ''[[Li (unit)|li]]'' / From Mortal Earth so far away.\"\n\n== Grotto-Heaven ==\nTaoists believe that the sacred mountains are interconnected via an underground network of dong tien, or [[grotto-heavens]], with ''dong'' meaning \"to penetrate something\" and ''tien'' referring to heaven. Going back as far as the fourth century, grotto-heavens were places where heaven and earth touched. By entering a grotto-heaven you penetrate deep within the mountain and arrive in the world of immortals: you enter \"the beyond within\". Mount Taibai has dozens of grotto-heaven. One of the grotto-heavens is called Place of Charm and Beauty ([[Pinyin language|pinyin:]] ''Bieyou Dong Tien''). Bieyou also refers to a celebrated poem \"Question and Answer in the Mountain\" by the great poet [[Li Bai|Li bai]]: \"You ask me why do I dwell in these green mountains / But I smile without a reply, only an easy mind / The river flows away silently / Bearing the fallen peach blossoms / Here is another world, but not the world of man.\" Peach blossoms refers to the legendary Peach Blossom Valley where deep in the mountains, in \"a different world\", happy people (immortals) live who know nothing of our existence.\n\nIn 1933 [[Yu Youren]], senior statesman of the Chinese Nationalist Party, poet and calligrapher, visited the Place of Charm and Beauty and wrote many poems there, including one carved into a rock which can still be seen today, right next to the grotto-heaven: \"Sleeping Buddha is nice / Once asleep all troubles are gone / I want to come and sleep here / But who will look after the country.\"\n\n== Three gods of Mount Taibai ==\n[[Sacred Mountains of China|Sacred Mountains]] each have their own god or several gods and Mount Taibai is no exception. Chinese gods are often historical figures, such as [[Laozi|Lao Z]]<nowiki/>i, who are elevated to gods first through their popularity amongst ordinary folks and then by the ruling emperor. Stories about the origin of the three gods of Mount Taibai therefore go back a long way. The oldest tale is about a man from Li Yang by the name of Gu Chun, meaning \u2018Spring Valley\u2019, who lived deep inside the forests of Mount Taibai during the [[Han dynasty|Han Dynasty]] (206 BC\u2013220 AD). When he died, his family buried him but during the night his body got up and they saw him leave. Local residents thus believed that he was the god of Mount Taibai and built a temple for him, calling it Taibai (and sometimes Gu Chun) Temple. More recent stories talk of not just one but three Taibai gods because, during the [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan Dynasty]] (1271\u20131368), there were three lakes on Taibai Shan. These lakes were revered for their water and cooling effect and were represented by the three Taibai gods, who were known as Ku Ji (Relieving the Suffering), Hui Min (Benefiting the People) and Ling Ying (Enlightening Answers). Local residents, however, called the three gods Da A Fu (The Great Fortune), Er A Fu (The Second Fortune) and San A Fu (The Third Fortune). But according to poet and politician [[Yu Youren]], the three Taibai gods are Yao, Shun and Yu, or the three demi-gods Earth, Heaven and Water from Chinese legend. And according to the old master [[Ren Fa Rong]], the three Taibai gods are Bo Yi, Shu Qi and Zhou Ben from the [[Shang dynasty|Shang Dynasty]] (17th\u201311th century BC). Bo Yi and Shu Qi were two princes of the [[Kingdom of Gu Zhu]] and Zhou Ben was a general. The king made Shu Qi the crown prince even though Shu Qi was only the third son and Bo Yi the eldest. After the old king died, Shu Qi asked Bo Yi to be the new king but Bo Yi said: \"We shouldn\u2019t resist our father\u2019s will,\" and ran away to Mount Taibai. Shu Qi did not think it was appropriate for him to succeed to the throne since tradition dictated that the throne should be inherited by the oldest son. He therefore gave the throne to the middle son, Ya Ping, and ran after Bo Yi to Mount Taibai. When the [[Zhou dynasty|Zhou Dynasty]] overthrew the Shang Dynasty, the two brothers believed it was not right for a vassal lord such as the duke of Zhou to snatch the kingdom from its lawful ruler. Having been told that \"all under heaven now belongs to the Zhou king\", they refused ever to eat again and so starved to death on Mount Taibai . Zhou Ben, the general, chose the same fate. Learning of their deaths, the wise minister of the Zhou Dynasty, Jiang Ziya, made the three men local gods of Mount Taibai for their great virtue and sense of righteousness. Others claim that the third god is not Zhou Ben but [[Li Bai]], the famous poet. During the [[Qing dynasty|Qing Dynasty]] of the 18th century, the province of [[Shaanxi]] requested approval from the emperor to incorporate the Taibai gods into official provincial celebrations. This did not come about immediately. In 1774, the 39th year of the [[Qianlong Emperor|Qianlong emperor]], Shaanxi province again asked for consent and this time it was granted. As a result, the Taibai gods\u2014previously ranked as mere dukes\u2014acquired the official title of king.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}\n\n== Tiejia Temple ==\nHalfway Mount Taibai, at approximately 1500m (6,000&nbsp;ft), stands the [[Tiejia Temple|Tiejia Taoist Ecology Temple]]. On the exact spot where one can today find the Tiejia Taoist Ecology Temple once stood the old Tiejiashu Temple, hidden amongst the foliage of age-old trees. The Tiejiashu Temple was built at the time of the Han Dynasty (206 BC\u2013220) and remained there until the Cultural Revolution. It was one of the oldest temples dedicated to the gods of Mount Taibai and the first temple on the route taken by pilgrims along the south side of the mountain. Next to the Tiejia Taoist Ecology Temple stand the Ecology Education Center. Respect for nature has always been deeply rooted in Taoist thought and is crucial to China in the present era of ecological crisis. Through the Ecology Education Center, the Taoist monks of the Tiejia Taoist Ecology Temple would be able to organize meetings and training programs designed to help people think in terms of sustainability, not only local visitors but also monks from other temples.\n\n== Nature reserve ==\n\nIn 1965 Mount Taibai became the center of a new Nature Preserve covering the surrounding 56,325 [[hectares]], with the purpose of protecting its [[warm temperate zone]] ecosystem. Mount Taibai has warm temperate, [[temperateness|temperate]], cool temperate, and [[alpine climate|alpine]] climate. The flora and fauna of Taibai are quite diverse, with species from both northern and southern Chinese environments uniquely coexisting in the region.\n\nThe base of the mountain is composed of stone covered by yellow [[loess]] soil, while the middle elevations of the mountain are covered with hardy trees and spectacular rocky outcrops. The higher elevations of the mountain contain glacial remnants, [[cirque]], peaks, [[aulacogen]], and [[moraine]], all of which have proven of great use toward geological research.\n\n== Environment ==\n\nFlora from both the sub-tropical and warm temperate climates inhabit areas of Taibai. Due to the mountain's rapid rises in elevation, plants from the middle temperate climate and alpine climates are also found in the same areas. Within the Nature Preserve's borders more than 1,700 different types of [[Spermatophyte|seed-bearing plants]] are found, comprising approximately 60% of the flora in the [[Qinling]] Range. Among the flora are found many second- and third-tier protected Chinese species, such as Chuan-Guo Vine, ''[[Eucommia]]'', ''[[Kingdonia]]'', ''[[Dipteronia sinensis]]'', ''[[Cercidiphyllum japonicum]]'', ''[[Euptelea pleiosperma]]'', ''[[Acer miaotaiense]]'', ''[[Trochodendraceae]]'', ''[[Sinowilsonia]]'', Taibai Rainbow (''Larix chinensis''), Qinling Crow's Head (''Aconitum liouii''), Chinese Hemlock, ''Populus purdomii'', ''[[Circaeasteraceae]]'', and Purple-Speckled Peony (''Paeonia rockii''), and others. About 40 types of animals inhabit the area, as well as 230 species of birds and several species of amphibians.\n\nMount Taibai National Forest Park is located within the borders of Tanggu in [[Mei County, Shaanxi]].\n\n[[File:Taibai-Dadian-Shan-3x.jpg|700px|thumb|left|Birds-eye panorama, taken from the Bodhisattva Temple at 2300m.]]\n[[File:TaiBai-Doumugong-WC.jpg|700px|thumb|left|A panorama in the heart of Taibai (with small hut in the center), taken from Doumu Palace, elev. 2900m.]]\n{{Clear|left}}\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n== External links ==\n<!-- insert external urls or websites -->\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Taibai}}\n[[Category:Mountains of Shaanxi]]\n[[Category:History of Shaanxi]]\n[[Category:Highest points of Chinese provinces]]\n", "name_user": "174.81.22.72", "label": "vandal", "comment": "(\u2192\u200eGrotto-Heaven)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Taibai"}
