Manendragarh Railway Station is on the [[Anuppur]]-[[Chirmiri]] rail route. There are many [[coal mine]]s around here. Manendragarh was originated by some tribals around 100 years ago; later developed by [[British Raj]] for coal excavation. Road and Railway Lines are developed by the British.\n\nNational Highway 43 has its route through Manendragarh. Sirrouli temple is very famous in Manendragarh which is near Udalkachar railway station. Amrit Dhara Waterfall is a nearby attraction. \"Sidh-Baba\" mount is famous for the [[Shiva]] temple.\n\n==Demographics==\n\nAs of the 2011 India [[census]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.censusindia.net/results/town.php?stad=A&state5=999|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040616075334/http://www.censusindia.net/results/town.php?stad=A&state5=999|archivedate=2004-06-16|title= Census of India 2001: Data from the 2001 Census, including cities, villages and towns  (Provisional)|accessdate=2008-11-01|publisher= Census Commission of India}}</ref> Manendragarh had a population of 30,748. Males constitute 53% of the population and females 47%. Manendragarh has an average literacy rate of 72%, higher than the national average of 59.5%: male literacy is 79%, and female literacy is 64%. In Manendragarh, 13% of the population is under 6 years of age.

The main coal belts are in the Hasdo basin. There are small deposits of limestone, fire clay and red oxide in Manendragarh.\n\n== Ecology==\n=== Drainage ===\nA part of Manendragarh region lies in the Ganges basin and the remaining portion is in the Mahanadi basin. Gopad is the major tribute of Son and originates about 10 miles North of Mendra village. It drains the Northern portion of the District. Hasdeo a major tributary of Mahanadi has its origin in Mendra village.\n\n==== Rivers ====\nThe Hasdeo river is the largest river flowing towards the South. It rises from 23\u00b030\u00b4 North by 82\u00b030\u00b4 East on the Sonhat Plateau and drains the South-Western part of the District. In this District, the river course resembles an upturned 'S' and flows for about 95&nbsp;km. After a course of about 72&nbsp;km, it enters Bilaspur District at 23\u00b0 North. It receives the waters of the Gej and the Chornai on the left bank and the Tan and the Ahiran on the right before it meets the Mahanadi. The total length of the river is 245&nbsp;km. The valley is narrow. Important settlements along the river are Sonhat, Ghugra, Manendragarh, Kosgain, Korba and Champa.\n\n=== Forest ===\nManendragarh  has vast range of forests. Up to the last decade of the 19th century. Most common trees of Korea District are Sal, Mahua, Tendu, Palas, Char, Bija, Harra, Bahera, Sisam, Kusum, Salya, Khair, Arun, Gamhar etc. Bamboos are mostly available in the forests.\n\n== Economy ==\nThe income of Manendragarh Region is based on rural market as well as South Eastern Coal Limited (SECL). Chamber of Commerce is established in Manendragarh for the issues regarding businesses and for the welfare of business owners.

Collins' parents divorced, and her mother married American [[stunt performer]] [[Bobby Bass]].\n\nCollins attended [[Narbonne High School]] and George S. Patton Continuation School, both in [[Harbor City, California]]. She remarked in a 1985 interview on ''Late Night with David Letterman'':\n\n{{quote|quote=I was 16 when I quit high school.

Not long after the two started dating, Derek divorced his wife, actress [[Linda Evans]]. The couple moved to Germany, where John Derek would not be subject to prosecution under California [[statutory rape]] laws because Collins was under the [[Ages of consent in the United States|age of consent]].\n\nIn 1973 John Derek began production on a film entitled ''[[Fantasies (film)|Fantasies]]'', a low-budget, English-language romantic drama starring Collins and several unknown German actors. The film was shot over a 10-day period in Greece. In an effort to capitalize on Collins' beauty, Derek worked into the film several risqu\u00e9 scenes, including brief nudity. John Derek twice re-edited the film in an effort to sell it to major studios. The film remained unreleased until 1981, at which time it received negative notices.<ref>{{cite web|title=Young Bo Derek In 'Fantasies'|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/11/07/movies/young-bo-derek-in-fantasies.html?mcubz=2|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=1981-11-07|accessdate=2017-06-13}}</ref>\n\nCollins and John Derek married on June 10, 1976; she was 19 and he 49.

Derek's appearance in a dream sequence, racing towards Moore in a flimsy flesh-colored swimsuit, launched her status as a mainstream sex symbol. This sequence and Derek\u2019s cornrow hairstyle in the film have often been parodied.

A widow since 1998, she lives with actor [[John Corbett]]. Now in semi-retirement, she makes occasional film, television, and documentary appearances.\n\n== Early life ==\n\nDerek was born Mary Cathleen Collins in [[Long Beach, California]]. Her father, Paul Collins, was a [[Hobie Cat]] executive, and her mother, Norma (n\u00e9e White), was a make-up artist and hairdresser to [[Ann-Margret]]. Collins' parents divorced, and her mother married American [[stunt performer]] [[Bobby Bass]].\n\nCollins attended [[Narbonne High School]] and George S. Patton Continuation School, both in [[Harbor City, California]]. She remarked in a 1985 interview on ''Late Night with David Letterman'':\n\n{{quote|quote=I was 16 when I quit high school.

Not long after the two started dating, Derek divorced his wife, actress [[Linda Evans]]. The couple moved to Germany, where John Derek would not be subject to prosecution under California [[statutory rape]] laws because Collins was under the [[Ages of consent in the United States|age of consent]].\n\nIn 1973 John Derek began production on a film entitled ''[[Fantasies (film)|Fantasies]]'', a low-budget, English-language romantic drama starring Collins and several unknown German actors. The film was shot over a 10-day period in Greece. In an effort to capitalize on Collins' beauty, Derek worked into the film several risqu\u00e9 scenes, including brief nudity. John Derek twice re-edited the film in an effort to sell it to major studios. The film remained unreleased until 1981, at which time it received negative notices.<ref>{{cite web|title=Young Bo Derek In 'Fantasies'|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/11/07/movies/young-bo-derek-in-fantasies.html?mcubz=2|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=1981-11-07|accessdate=2017-06-13}}</ref>\n\nCollins and John Derek married on June 10, 1976; she was 19 and he 49.

Derek's appearance in a dream sequence, racing towards Moore in a flimsy flesh-colored swimsuit, launched her status as a mainstream sex symbol. This sequence and Derek\u2019s cornrow hairstyle in the film have often been parodied. ''10'' was a critical and financial success.<ref>{{cite web|title=Top 1979 Movies at the Domestic Box Office|url=http://www.the-numbers.com/box-office-records/domestic/all-movies/cumulative/released-in-1979|publisher=Nash Information Services LLC|accessdate=2017-06-13}}</ref>\n\nAfter ''10,'' Derek was cast in ''[[A Change of Seasons (film)|A Change of Seasons]]'' (1980), a dramatic-comedy film that featured [[Shirley MacLaine]] and [[Anthony Hopkins]].

Directed by her husband, the film dealt little with [[Tarzan]] and instead focused on Derek's character of [[Jane Porter (Tarzan)|Jane Parker]], and specifically on Derek's physical attributes. Several scenes of Derek wearing revealing outfits were featured, along with nude scenes of Derek being bathed and body-painted. Prior to the film's release MGM and the film's distributor, [[United Artists]], were sued by the [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]] estate over the name of the film, as Derek's role and body overshadowed the story of Tarzan.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bo Derek Takes To The Jungle To Bring 'Tarzan' Back Alive|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/07/19/movies/bo-derek-takes-to-the-jungle-to-bring-tarzan-back-alive.html?pagewanted=all&mcubz=2|publisher=The New York Times Company|date=1981-07-19|accessdate=2017-06-13}}</ref> Although the film received negative reviews from many critics, ''Tarzan, the Ape Man'' became a box-office success, making over $35 million in ticket sales and becoming the [[1981 in film|15th highest-grossing film of 1981]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/yearly/chart/?yr=1981&p=.htm|title=1981 Yearly Box Office Results \u2013 Box Office Mojo|author=|date=|work=boxofficemojo.com|accessdate=July 19, 2016}}</ref> For her performance, Derek shared the [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actress]] with [[Faye Dunaway]], the latter for her starring role as [[Joan Crawford]] in ''[[Mommie Dearest (film)|Mommie Dearest]]''.\n\nDerek starred in ''[[Bolero (1984 film)|Bolero]]'' (1984). Again directed by John Derek, the film explored the female protagonist's sexual awakening, and her journey around the world to find an ideal first lover to take her virginity. Its sexual nature, along with its substantial use of nudity, resulted in the film receiving an [[X rating]], usually reserved for [[pornographic]] or extremely violent horror films.

The final collaboration of Derek with her husband as director, ''Ghosts Can't Do It'' was a failure both critically (a \"cinematic abomination\")<ref>{{cite web|title=Ghosts Can't Do It|url=http://www.allmovie.com/movie/ghosts-cant-do-it-v19688|publisher=Allmovie|accessdate=2017-06-13}}</ref> and financially.<ref>{{cite web|title=Your Movie Sucks|url=http://www.ultimatemovierankings.com/your-movie-sucks/|publisher=ultimatemovierankings.com|accessdate=2017-06-13}}</ref> For her performance in ''Ghosts Can't Do It'', during which she delivered such lines as \"You have my heart...how can I live without my heart,\" Derek won her third [[Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Actress]].

Schwend had been a medical officer during the [[First Battle of Ypres]] in 1914. He had been sent a copy of the painting by a Lieutenant Colonel Earle in 1936. Earle had been treated by Schwend in a medical post at the [[Menen|Menin]] Crossroads and they remained in touch after the war.<ref>{{cite book|last=Johnson|first=David|title=One Soldier And Hitler, 1918|year=2012|publisher=the History Press|location=Gloucestershire|isbn=978 0 7524 6613 2|page=149}}</ref>\n\nThe painting was commissioned by the Green Howards Regiment from the Italian artist in 1923, showing a soldier purported to be Tandey carrying a wounded man at the Kruiseke Crossroads in 1914, northwest of Menin. The painting was made from a sketch, provided to Matania, by the regiment, based on an actual event at that crossroads. A building shown behind Tandey in the painting belonged to the Van Den Broucke family, who were presented with a copy of the painting by the Green Howard's Regiment.<ref>{{cite book|last=Johnson|first=David|title=One Soldier And Hitler, 1918|year=2012|publisher=the History Press|location=Gloucestershire|isbn=978 0 7524 6613 2|pages= 149\u2013150}}</ref>\n\nSchwend obtained a large photo of the painting. Captain Weidemann, Hitler's [[adjutant]], wrote the following response:\n\n{{quote|I beg to acknowledge your friendly gift which has been sent to Berlin through the good offices of Dr. Schwend. The F\u00fchrer is naturally very interested in things connected with his own war experiences, and he was obviously moved when I showed him the photograph and explained the thought which you had in causing it to be sent to him. He was obviously moved when I showed him the picture.

Hitler replied: <blockquote>That man came so near to killing me that I thought I should never see Germany again; Providence saved me from such devilishly accurate fire as those English boys were aiming at us.<ref name=\"Johnson 2012 150\">{{cite book|last=Johnson|first=David|title=One Soldier And Hitler, 1918|year=2012|publisher=the History Press|location=Gloucestershire|isbn=978 0 7524 6613 2|page=150}}</ref></blockquote>\n\nAccording to the story, Hitler asked Chamberlain to convey his best wishes and gratitude to Tandey.

Schwend had been a medical officer during the [[First Battle of Ypres]] in 1914. He had been sent a copy of the painting by a Lieutenant Colonel Earle in 1936.

The painting was made from a sketch, provided to Matania, by the regiment, based on an actual event at that crossroads.

Three days later (18 March 1919) he was promoted to acting [[lance corporal]]. He remained with the 3rd Battalion on 'Home Service' until 4 February 1921, when he transferred to the 2nd Battalion. Four days later on 8 February 1921 he requested to revert to the rank of private.\n\nTandey served with the 2nd Battalion in Gibraltar from 11 April 1922 to 18 February 1923, in Turkey from 19 February \u2013 23 August 1923 and finally in Egypt from 24 August 1923 until 29 September 1925. He was finally discharged from the army on 5 January 1926.\n\nIn addition to his major awards Tandey had also been [[Mentioned in Despatches]] on five occasions.

In 1940, during the [[Coventry Blitz]], his home was bombed by the [[Luftwaffe]]. A journalist approached him outside his bombed Coventry home, asking him about his alleged encounter with Hitler. \"If only I had known what he would turn out to be,\" Tandey is quoted as saying. \"When I saw all the people and women and children he had killed and wounded I was sorry to God I let him go.\" However, there is no evidence, not even anecdotal, he was either hounded or avoided after the claims.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-28593256|title=War hero who did not shoot Hitler|first=Bethan|last=Bell|date=4 August 2014|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}</ref>\n\nTandey became a Police sergeant at the Standard Triumph Works, Fletchamstead a position he held for 38 years.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.triumphworks.co.uk/|title=Standard Triumph Works Directory \u2013 Documenting Employees of the Standard and Triumph Works}}</ref>\n\nTandey died in 1977, childless, at the age of 86.

Unaware that the medals should have been returned to the museum, the medals were auctioned at [[Sotheby's]] in London by his wife and a private collector subsequently purchased them.

None is in active military service with U.S  forces. The B-26 was built at two locations : Baltimore, MD; and Omaha,  NE, by the [[Glenn L. Martin Company]]. The Baltimore plant was located at [[Middle River, Maryland]] (just east of [[Baltimore]]) from 1941 to 1945. The western location was part of the expansion of government owned, inland plants.\n\nFirst used in the [[Asiatic-Pacific Theater|Pacific Theater]] of [[World War II]] in early 1942, it was also used in the [[Mediterranean Theater of Operations|Mediterranean Theater]] and in [[Western Front (World War II)|Western Europe]].\n\nAfter entering service with the [[United States Army]] aviation units, the [[Fixed-wing aircraft|aircraft]] quickly received the reputation of a \"[[:en:wikt:widow-maker|widowmaker]]\" due to the early models' high accident rate during takeoffs and landings. This was due to the fact that the Marauder had to be flown at precise [[airspeed]]s, particularly on final runway approach or when one engine was out. The unusually high 150&nbsp;mph (241&nbsp;km/h) speed on short final runway approach was intimidating to many pilots who were used to much slower approach speeds, and whenever they slowed down to speeds below what the manual stipulated, the aircraft would often stall and crash.<ref name=\"Ethell 1995, p. 242\">Ethell 1995, p. 242.</ref>\n\nThe B-26 became a safer aircraft once crews were re-trained, and after [[aerodynamics]] modifications (an increase of wingspan and wing [[angle of incidence (aerodynamics)|angle-of-incidence]] to give better takeoff performance, and a larger vertical stabilizer and rudder).<ref name=\"Ethell 1995, pp. 242-243\">Ethell 1995, pp. 242\u2013243.</ref> The Marauder ended World War II with the lowest loss rate  of any USAAF bomber.<ref name=\"Ethell 1995, p. 243\">Ethell 1995, p. 243.</ref>\n\nA total of 5,288 were produced between February 1941 and March 1945; 522 of these were flown by the [[Royal Air Force]] and the [[South African Air Force]]. By the time the [[United States Air Force]] was created as an independent military service separate from the [[United States Army]] in 1947, all Martin B-26s had been retired from U.S. service. After the Marauder was retired the unrelated [[Douglas A-26 Invader]] then assumed the \"B-26\" designation which led to confusion between the two aircraft.\n\n==Design and development==\nIn March 1939, the [[United States Army Air Corps]] issued Circular Proposal 39-640, a specification for a twin-engined medium bomber with a maximum speed of {{convert|350|mph|abbr=on}}, a range of {{convert|3000|mi|abbr=on}} and a bomb load of {{convert|2000|lb|abbr=on}}. On 5 July 1939, the [[Glenn L. Martin Company]] submitted its design, produced by a team led by [[Peyton M. Magruder]], to meet the requirement, the Martin Model 179. Martin's design was evaluated as superior to the other proposals and was awarded a contract for 201 aircraft, to be designated B-26.<ref name=\"AI Jan 88 p23\">''Air International'' January 1988, p. 23.</ref> The B-26 went from paper concept to an operational bomber in approximately two years.<ref name=\"Trent p. 647\">Trent 2008, p. 647.</ref> Additional orders for a further 930 B-26s followed in September 1940, still prior to the first flight of the type.<ref name=\"AI Jan 88 p25\">''Air International'' January 1988, p. 25.</ref>\n\n[[File:Closeup view of Martin B-26C in flight.jpg|thumb|right|Closeup view of a Martin B-26B Marauder in flight]]\nThe B-26 was a shoulder-winged [[monoplane]] of all-metal construction, fitted with a [[tricycle landing gear]]. It had a streamlined, circular section [[fuselage]] housing the crew, consisting of a [[bombardier (air force)|bombardier]] in the nose, armed with a {{convert|.30|in|sigfig=3|abbr=on}} [[machine gun]], a pilot and co-pilot sitting side by side, with positions for the radio operator and navigator behind the pilots. A gunner manned a dorsal turret armed with two {{convert|.50|in|sigfig=3|abbr=on}} machine guns (the first powered dorsal turret to be fitted to a U.S. bomber), and an additional {{convert|.30|in|sigfig=3|abbr=on}} machine gun was fitted in the tail.{{refn|Rare photos on pp. 61\u201362 show the original tail gun position for the B-26 Marauder 1A with the single .30 caliber replaced with a single .50 caliber, and tail gun position of the B-26B which was upgraded from one .50 caliber to two .50 caliber machine guns.<ref name=\"Hot\"/> |group=Note}}\n\nTwo [[bomb bay]]s were fitted mid-fuselage, capable of carrying {{convert|5800|lb|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} of bombs, although in practice such a bomb load reduced range too much, and the aft bomb bay was usually fitted with additional fuel tanks instead of bombs. The aircraft was powered by two [[Pratt & Whitney R-2800 Double Wasp]] [[radial engine]]s in nacelles slung under the wing, driving four-bladed propellers. The engines were manufactured at the [[Ford Dearborn Engine plant]] in [[Dearborn, Michigan]], USA. The wings were of low [[aspect ratio (wing)|aspect ratio]] and relatively small in area for an aircraft of its weight, giving the required high performance, but also resulting in a [[wing loading]] of {{cvt|53|lb/sqft|kg/m2}} for the initial versions, which at the time was the highest of any aircraft accepted for service by the Army Air Corps, until the introduction of the  [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress]], with the then-astonishing wing loading of {{cvt|69.12|lb/sqft|kg/m2}} (although both would be considered lightly loaded by the standard of combat aircraft of the next decade).<ref name=\"AI Jan 88 p23-5\">''Air International'' January 1988, pp. 23\u201325.</ref>\n\nThe first B-26, with Martin test pilot William K. \"Ken\" Ebel at the controls, flew on 25 November 1940 and was effectively the prototype. Deliveries to the U.S. Army Air Corps began in February 1941 with the second aircraft, ''40-1362''.<ref name=\"AI Jan 88 p25\"/> In March 1941, the Army Air Corps started Accelerated Service Testing of the B-26 at [[Wright-Patterson AFB|Patterson Field]], near [[Dayton, Ohio]].\n\n===Accidents===\n{{refimprove|section|date=November 2019}}\nThe B-26's relatively small wing area and resulting high [[wing loading]] required a high landing speed of {{convert|120|to|135|mph|abbr=on}} [[indicated airspeed]] depending on load. At least two of the earliest B-26s suffered hard landings and damage to the main landing gear, engine mounts, propellers and fuselage. The type was grounded briefly in April 1941<ref>Mendenhall; lack of entries on Forms 5A</ref> to investigate the landing difficulties. Two causes were found: insufficient landing speed (producing a [[stall (flight)|stall]]) and improper weight distribution. The latter was due to the lack of a dorsal turret; the Martin power turret was not yet ready.\n\nSome of the very earliest B-26s suffered collapses of the nose landing gear. It is said that they were caused by improper weight distribution, but that is not likely to have been the only reason. The incidents occurred during low-speed taxiing, takeoffs and landings, and occasionally the strut unlocked. Later the Martin electric dorsal turret was retrofitted to some of the first B-26s. Martin also began testing a taller vertical stabilizer and revised tail gunner's position in 1941.\n\nThe Pratt & Whitney [[R-2800-5]] engines were reliable, but the Curtiss electric [[Propeller governor|pitch change mechanism]] in the propellers required impeccable maintenance, not always attainable in the field. [[Human error]] and some failures of the mechanism occasionally placed the propeller blades in flat pitch resulting in an overspeeding propeller, sometimes known as a \"runaway prop\". Due to its sound and the possibility that the propeller blades could disintegrate, this situation was particularly frightening for aircrews. More challenging was a loss of power in one engine during takeoff. These and other malfunctions, as well as human error, claimed a number of aircraft and the commanding officer of the [[22nd Bombardment Group]], Colonel Mark Lewis.\n\nThe Martin B-26 suffered only two fatal accidents during its first year of flight, from November 1940 to November 1941: a crash shortly after takeoff near Martin's [[Middle River, Maryland|Middle River]] plant in [[Maryland]] (cause unknown, but engine malfunction strongly suggested) and the loss of a [[38th Bombardment Group]] B-26 when its vertical stabilizer and rudder separated from the aircraft at altitude (cause unknown, but the accident report discussed the possibility that a canopy hatch broke off and struck the vertical stabilizer).\n\nAs pilots were trained quickly for the war, relatively inexperienced pilots entered the cockpit and the accident rate increased. This occurred at the same time as more experienced B-26 pilots of the 22nd, 38th and [[42nd Bombardment Group]]s were proving the merits of the bomber.\n\nFor a time in 1942, pilots in training believed that the B-26 could not be flown on one engine. This was disproved by several experienced pilots, including Colonel [[Jimmy Doolittle]], who flew demonstration flights at [[MacDill Air Force Base|MacDill Army Air Field]], which featured take offs and landings with only one engine. Also, seventeen [[Women Airforce Service Pilots]] were trained to demonstrate the B-26, in an attempt to \"shame\" male pilots into the air.<ref>[https://www.worldwar2database.com/gallery/wwii0015 WASPs Receive Final Instructions Before Flying Martin B-26 Marauder]</ref>\n\nIn 1942, aviation pioneer and company founder [[Glenn L. Martin]] was called before the Senate Special Committee to Investigate the National Defense Program, (or also known as the \"[[Truman Committee]]\"), which was investigating defense contracting abuses. Senator [[Harry S Truman]] of [[Missouri]], the committee chairman (and future [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] and 33rd [[President of the United States]] in 1945-1952), asked Martin why the B-26 had problems. Martin responded that the wings were too short. Senator Truman curtly asked why the wings had not been changed. When Martin replied that the plans were too close to completion, and his company already had the contract, Truman's testy response was quick and to the point: In that case, the contract would be canceled. Martin corrected the wings.<ref>McCullough 2003, p. 319.</ref> (By February 1943, the newest model aircraft, the B-26B-10, had an additional {{convert|6|ft|m}} of wingspan, plus uprated engines, more armor and larger guns.)<ref>[https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&q=cache:uNu9nEjaJVEJ:www.marylandaviationmuseum.org/pdf/B26_spec.pdf+%22B-26+B%22+%226+feet%22+wing&hl=en&gl=us&pid=bl&srcid=ADGEEShJ8tOuOvd1pcVqdXRF6iguphAruZ8OJbXvwKxPPUHAt9aKzeJ8uYApDG4ExYpgZRow5RAljNb6YE_3BPPdGIgjP5xJEDOVd8RWREDPqlNIAZanXhNL7QxK6lMJpMR-kiV-M-tO&sig=AHIEtbS9G--srwDYxQY0W20gly_Xe-kOyw&pli=1 \"Martin Aircraft Specifications: B-26 Marauder Types.\"] ''The Glenn L.

This instability is similar to \"[[Dutch roll]]\".

Nevertheless, it remained a challenging aircraft to fly and continued to be unpopular with some pilots throughout its military career. In 1944, in answer to many pilots complaining to the press and their relatives back home, the USAAF and Martin took the unusual step during war, of commissioning large articles to be placed in various popular publications, \"educating\" and defending the so-called flying/accident record of the B-26 against \"slanders\". One of the largest of these articles was in the May 1944 issue of ''[[Popular Mechanics]]''.<ref name=\"Hot\">[https://books.google.com/books?id=hd8DAAAAMBAJ&pg=PA61&dq=popular+Mechanics+1944+Marader&hl=en&ei=tq2iTI7hEouenQflj92IBA&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=1&ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&q&f=true \"They Said It Was Too 'Hot' To Fly.\"] ''Popular Mechanics'', May 1944.</ref>\n\n==Operational history==\n[[File:Martin Marauder ExCC.jpg|right|thumb|Royal Air Force B-26 flying over [[Banja Luka]] during World War II]]\n\nThe B-26 Marauder was used mostly in Europe, but also saw action in the Mediterranean and the Pacific.

There, the 38th continued the testing of the B-26, including its range and fuel efficiency. Immediately after the entry of the United States into World War II, plans were tentatively developed to send the 38th BG to the South West Pacific and to equip it with B-26Bs fitted with more auxiliary fuel tanks and provisions for carrying [[aerial torpedo]]es.<ref name=\"AI Feb 88 p75\"/> Three 38th BG B-26Bs<ref>Letters from Maj.

Two were shot down and the other two were so badly damaged that they were written off after the mission. Their torpedoes failed to hit any Japanese ships, although they did shoot down one [[Mitsubishi A6M Zero]] fighter and killed two seamen aboard the aircraft carrier [[Japanese aircraft carrier Akagi|''Akagi'']] with machine-gun fire.<ref name=\"AI Feb 88 p75\"/><ref name=\"Shattered p151-3\">Parshall and Tulley 2005, pp. 151\u2013153.</ref> Notably, one of them, ''Susie Q'', after dropping its single torpedo and searching for a safer escape route, flew directly down the length of the ''Akagi'' while being chased by interceptors and anti-aircraft fire, which had to hold their fire to avoid hitting their own flagship.

In 1943, it was decided that the B-26 would be phased out of operations in the South West Pacific Theater in favor of the [[North American B-25 Mitchell]]. Nevertheless, the 19th Bombardment Squadron of the 22nd BG continued to fly missions in the B-26.

They were initially used to carry out low-level attacks against heavily defended targets, incurring heavy losses with poor results, before switching to medium level attacks. By the end of the [[North African Campaign]], the three B-26 groups had flown 1,587 sorties, losing 80 aircraft. This was double the loss rate of the B-25, which also flew 70% more sorties with fewer aircraft.<ref name=\"AI Feb 88 p76-7\">''Air International'' February 1988, pp. 76\u201377.</ref> Despite this, the B-26 continued in service with the [[Twelfth Air Force]], supporting the Allied advance through [[Allied invasion of Sicily|Sicily]], [[Italian Campaign (World War II)|Italy]] and [[Operation Dragoon|southern France]].<ref name=\"Donald p177\">Donald 1995, p. 177.</ref><ref name=\"Swan army p338\">Swanborough and Bowers 1963, p. 338.</ref> [[John Slessor|Air Marshal Sir John Slessor]], Deputy Commander-in-Chief Mediterranean Allied Air Forces, wrote of \"the astonishing accuracy of the experienced medium bomber groups \u2013 particularly the Marauders; I think that the 42nd Bombardment Group in Sardinia is probably the best day-bomber unit in the world.\"<ref name=\"Slessor p572\">Slessor 1957, p. 572.</ref> Slessor in fact meant the 42nd Bomb Wing\u201417th, 319th and 320th Bomb Groups\u2014but a US 'wing' equated roughly to a British 'group', and vice versa.\n\n===Northwest Europe===\n[[File:B-26B Flak Damage.jpg|thumb|right|Martin B-26B-1-MA Marauder, AAF Ser.

None is in active military service with U.S  forces. The B-26 was built at two locations : Baltimore, MD; and Omaha,  NE, by the [[Glenn L. Martin Company]]. The Baltimore plant was located at [[Middle River, Maryland]] (just east of [[Baltimore]]) from 1941 to 1945. The western location was part of the expansion of government owned, inland plants.\n\nFirst used in the [[Asiatic-Pacific Theater|Pacific Theater]] of [[World War II]] in early 1942, it was also used in the [[Mediterranean Theater of Operations|Mediterranean Theater]] and in [[Western Front (World War II)|Western Europe]].\n\nAfter entering service with the [[United States Army]] aviation units, the [[Fixed-wing aircraft|aircraft]] quickly received the reputation of a \"[[:en:wikt:widow-maker|widowmaker]]\" due to the early models' high accident rate during takeoffs and landings. This was due to the fact that the Marauder had to be flown at exact [[airspeed]]s, particularly on final runway approach or when one engine was out. The unusually high 150&nbsp;mph (241&nbsp;km/h) speed on short final runway approach was intimidating to many pilots who were used to much slower approach speeds, and whenever they slowed down to speeds below what the manual stipulated, the aircraft would often stall and crash.<ref name=\"Ethell 1995, p. 242\">Ethell 1995, p. 242.</ref>\n\nThe B-26 became a safer aircraft once crews were re-trained, and after [[aerodynamics]] modifications (an increase of wingspan and wing [[angle of incidence (aerodynamics)|angle-of-incidence]] to give better takeoff performance, and a larger vertical stabilizer and rudder).<ref name=\"Ethell 1995, pp. 242-243\">Ethell 1995, pp. 242\u2013243.</ref> The Marauder ended World War II with the lowest loss rate  of any USAAF bomber.<ref name=\"Ethell 1995, p. 243\">Ethell 1995, p. 243.</ref>\n\nA total of 5,288 were produced between February 1941 and March 1945; 522 of these were flown by the [[Royal Air Force]] and the [[South African Air Force]]. By the time the [[United States Air Force]] was created as an independent military service separate from the [[United States Army]] in 1947, all Martin B-26s had been retired from U.S. service. After the Marauder was retired the unrelated [[Douglas A-26 Invader]] then assumed the \"B-26\" designation which led to confusion between the two aircraft.\n\n==Design and development==\nIn March 1939, the [[United States Army Air Corps]] issued Circular Proposal 39-640, a specification for a twin-engined medium bomber with a maximum speed of {{convert|350|mph|abbr=on}}, a range of {{convert|3000|mi|abbr=on}} and a bomb load of {{convert|2000|lb|abbr=on}}. On 5 July 1939, the [[Glenn L. Martin Company]] submitted its design, produced by a team led by [[Peyton M. Magruder]], to meet the requirement, the Martin Model 179. Martin's design was evaluated as superior to the other proposals and was awarded a contract for 201 aircraft, to be designated B-26.<ref name=\"AI Jan 88 p23\">''Air International'' January 1988, p. 23.</ref> The B-26 went from paper concept to an operational bomber in approximately two years.<ref name=\"Trent p. 647\">Trent 2008, p. 647.</ref> Additional orders for a further 930 B-26s followed in September 1940, still prior to the first flight of the type.<ref name=\"AI Jan 88 p25\">''Air International'' January 1988, p. 25.</ref>\n\n[[File:Closeup view of Martin B-26C in flight.jpg|thumb|right|Closeup view of a Martin B-26B Marauder in flight]]\nThe B-26 was a shoulder-winged [[monoplane]] of all-metal construction, fitted with a [[tricycle landing gear]]. It had a streamlined, circular section [[fuselage]] housing the crew, consisting of a [[bombardier (air force)|bombardier]] in the nose, armed with a {{convert|.30|in|sigfig=3|abbr=on}} [[machine gun]], a pilot and co-pilot sitting side by side, with positions for the radio operator and navigator behind the pilots. A gunner manned a dorsal turret armed with two {{convert|.50|in|sigfig=3|abbr=on}} machine guns (the first powered dorsal turret to be fitted to a U.S. bomber), and an additional {{convert|.30|in|sigfig=3|abbr=on}} machine gun was fitted in the tail.{{refn|Rare photos on pp. 61\u201362 show the original tail gun position for the B-26 Marauder 1A with the single .30 caliber replaced with a single .50 caliber, and tail gun position of the B-26B which was upgraded from one .50 caliber to two .50 caliber machine guns.<ref name=\"Hot\"/> |group=Note}}\n\nTwo [[bomb bay]]s were fitted mid-fuselage, capable of carrying {{convert|5800|lb|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} of bombs, although in practice such a bomb load reduced range too much, and the aft bomb bay was usually fitted with additional fuel tanks instead of bombs. The aircraft was powered by two [[Pratt & Whitney R-2800 Double Wasp]] [[radial engine]]s in nacelles slung under the wing, driving four-bladed propellers. The engines were manufactured at the [[Ford Dearborn Engine plant]] in [[Dearborn, Michigan]], USA. The wings were of low [[aspect ratio (wing)|aspect ratio]] and relatively small in area for an aircraft of its weight, giving the required high performance, but also resulting in a [[wing loading]] of {{cvt|53|lb/sqft|kg/m2}} for the initial versions, which at the time was the highest of any aircraft accepted for service by the Army Air Corps, until the introduction of the  [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress]], with the then-astonishing wing loading of {{cvt|69.12|lb/sqft|kg/m2}} (although both would be considered lightly loaded by the standard of combat aircraft of the next decade).<ref name=\"AI Jan 88 p23-5\">''Air International'' January 1988, pp. 23\u201325.</ref>\n\nThe first B-26, with Martin test pilot William K. \"Ken\" Ebel at the controls, flew on 25 November 1940 and was effectively the prototype. Deliveries to the U.S. Army Air Corps began in February 1941 with the second aircraft, ''40-1362''.<ref name=\"AI Jan 88 p25\"/> In March 1941, the Army Air Corps started Accelerated Service Testing of the B-26 at [[Wright-Patterson AFB|Patterson Field]], near [[Dayton, Ohio]].\n\n===Accidents===\n{{refimprove|section|date=November 2019}}\nThe B-26's relatively small wing area and resulting high [[wing loading]] required a high landing speed of {{convert|120|to|135|mph|abbr=on}} [[indicated airspeed]] depending on load. At least two of the earliest B-26s suffered hard landings and damage to the main landing gear, engine mounts, propellers and fuselage. The type was grounded briefly in April 1941<ref>Mendenhall; lack of entries on Forms 5A</ref> to investigate the landing difficulties. Two causes were found: insufficient landing speed (producing a [[stall (flight)|stall]]) and improper weight distribution. The latter was due to the lack of a dorsal turret; the Martin power turret was not yet ready.\n\nSome of the very earliest B-26s suffered collapses of the nose landing gear. It is said that they were caused by improper weight distribution, but that is not likely to have been the only reason. The incidents occurred during low-speed taxiing, takeoffs and landings, and occasionally the strut unlocked. Later the Martin electric dorsal turret was retrofitted to some of the first B-26s. Martin also began testing a taller vertical stabilizer and revised tail gunner's position in 1941.\n\nThe Pratt & Whitney [[R-2800-5]] engines were reliable, but the Curtiss electric [[Propeller governor|pitch change mechanism]] in the propellers required impeccable maintenance, not always attainable in the field. [[Human error]] and some failures of the mechanism occasionally placed the propeller blades in flat pitch resulting in an overspeeding propeller, sometimes known as a \"runaway prop\". Due to its sound and the possibility that the propeller blades could disintegrate, this situation was particularly frightening for aircrews. More challenging was a loss of power in one engine during takeoff. These and other malfunctions, as well as human error, claimed a number of aircraft and the commanding officer of the [[22nd Bombardment Group]], Colonel Mark Lewis.\n\nThe Martin B-26 suffered only two fatal accidents during its first year of flight, from November 1940 to November 1941: a crash shortly after takeoff near Martin's [[Middle River, Maryland|Middle River]] plant in [[Maryland]] (cause unknown, but engine malfunction strongly suggested) and the loss of a [[38th Bombardment Group]] B-26 when its vertical stabilizer and rudder separated from the aircraft at altitude (cause unknown, but the accident report discussed the possibility that a canopy hatch broke off and struck the vertical stabilizer).\n\nAs pilots were trained quickly for the war, relatively inexperienced pilots entered the cockpit and the accident rate increased. This occurred at the same time as more experienced B-26 pilots of the 22nd, 38th and [[42nd Bombardment Group]]s were proving the merits of the bomber.\n\nFor a time in 1942, pilots in training believed that the B-26 could not be flown on one engine. This was disproved by several experienced pilots, including Colonel [[Jimmy Doolittle]], who flew demonstration flights at [[MacDill Air Force Base|MacDill Army Air Field]], which featured take offs and landings with only one engine. Also, seventeen [[Women Airforce Service Pilots]] were trained to demonstrate the B-26, in an attempt to \"shame\" male pilots into the air.<ref>[https://www.worldwar2database.com/gallery/wwii0015 WASPs Receive Final Instructions Before Flying Martin B-26 Marauder]</ref>\n\nIn 1942, aviation pioneer and company founder [[Glenn L. Martin]] was called before the Senate Special Committee to Investigate the National Defense Program, (or also known as the \"[[Truman Committee]]\"), which was investigating defense contracting abuses. Senator [[Harry S Truman]] of [[Missouri]], the committee chairman (and future [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] and 33rd [[President of the United States]] in 1945-1952), asked Martin why the B-26 had problems. Martin responded that the wings were too short. Senator Truman curtly asked why the wings had not been changed. When Martin replied that the plans were too close to completion, and his company already had the contract, Truman's testy response was quick and to the point: In that case, the contract would be canceled. Martin corrected the wings.<ref>McCullough 2003, p. 319.</ref> (By February 1943, the newest model aircraft, the B-26B-10, had an additional {{convert|6|ft|m}} of wingspan, plus uprated engines, more armor and larger guns.)<ref>[https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&q=cache:uNu9nEjaJVEJ:www.marylandaviationmuseum.org/pdf/B26_spec.pdf+%22B-26+B%22+%226+feet%22+wing&hl=en&gl=us&pid=bl&srcid=ADGEEShJ8tOuOvd1pcVqdXRF6iguphAruZ8OJbXvwKxPPUHAt9aKzeJ8uYApDG4ExYpgZRow5RAljNb6YE_3BPPdGIgjP5xJEDOVd8RWREDPqlNIAZanXhNL7QxK6lMJpMR-kiV-M-tO&sig=AHIEtbS9G--srwDYxQY0W20gly_Xe-kOyw&pli=1 \"Martin Aircraft Specifications: B-26 Marauder Types.\"] ''The Glenn L.

There, the 38th continued the testing of the B-26, including its range and fuel efficiency. Immediately after the entry of the United States into World War II, plans were tentatively developed to send the 38th BG to the South West Pacific and to equip it with B-26Bs fitted with more auxiliary fuel tanks and provisions for carrying [[aerial torpedo]]es.<ref name=\"AI Feb 88 p75\"/> Three 38th BG B-26Bs<ref>Letters from Maj.

Two were shot down and the other two were so badly damaged that they were written off after the mission. Their torpedoes failed to hit any Japanese ships, although they did shoot down one [[Mitsubishi A6M Zero]] fighter and killed two seamen aboard the aircraft carrier [[Japanese aircraft carrier Akagi|''Akagi'']] with machine-gun fire.<ref name=\"AI Feb 88 p75\"/><ref name=\"Shattered p151-3\">Parshall and Tulley 2005, pp. 151\u2013153.</ref> Notably, one of them, ''Susie Q'', after dropping its single torpedo and searching for a safer escape route, flew directly down the length of the ''Akagi'' while being chased by interceptors and anti-aircraft fire, which had to hold their fire to avoid hitting their own flagship.

In 1943, it was decided that the B-26 would be phased out of operations in the South West Pacific Theater in favor of the [[North American B-25 Mitchell]].

In 1977, Liverpool manager [[Bob Paisley]] paid a British transfer record of \u00a3440,000 to bring Dalglish to Liverpool.

In 1977, Liverpool manager [[Bob Paisley]] paid a British transfer record of \u00a3440,000 to bring Dalglish to Liverpool. His years at Liverpool were among the club's most successful periods, as he won six [[list of English football champions|English league championships]], the [[FA Cup]], four [[Football League Cup|League Cup]]s, five [[FA Charity Shield]]s, three [[European Cup]]s and one [[European Super Cup]]. In international football, Dalglish made 102 appearances and scored 30 goals for [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] between 1971 and 1986, becoming their most [[Cap (sport)|capped]] player and joint-leading goalscorer (with [[Denis Law]]).\n\nDalglish became [[player-manager]] of Liverpool in 1985 after the resignation of [[Joe Fagan]], winning a further three First Divisions, two FA Cups and four FA Charity Shields, before resigning in 1991. Eight months later, Dalglish made a return to football management with [[Blackburn Rovers F.C|Blackburn Rovers]], whom he led from the [[Football League Second Division|Second Division]] to win the [[Premier League]] in 1995. Soon afterwards, he stepped down as manager to become [[Director of Football]] at the club, before leaving altogether in 1996.

Newcastle finished runners-up in the Premier League during his first season, but they only finished 13th in [[1997\u201398 in English football|1997\u201398]], which led to his dismissal the following season. Dalglish went on to be appointed [[Director of Football]] at Celtic in 1999, and later manager, where he won the [[Scottish League Cup]] before an acrimonious departure the following year.\n\nBetween 2000 and 2010, Dalglish focused on charitable concerns, founding The Marina Dalglish Appeal with his wife to raise money for cancer care.

One example completed the first transcontinental non-stop roundtrip flight, made in 1929 by the CA-6 ''Spokane Sun-God'',<ref name=Meister>{{cite web|last=Meister Jr.|first=Richard L.|url=http://www.aerofiles.com/sungod.html|title=The Flight of the Buhl Airsedan Spokane Sun-God|date=February 2000|accessdate=28 January 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> and the first [[Pope]] to have flown did so in a Buhl Airsedan.<ref name=goldenwingsmuseum/>\n\n==Design and development==\nThe Airsedan series were designed by [[Etienne Dormoy]] following the departure of [[Alfred V. Verville]] from Buhl, with whom he had worked previously. Dormoy had worked with [[Deperdussin]] before [[World War one]], flew combat operations during the war before returning to work with [[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 pour l'aviation et ses d\u00e9riv\u00e9s|SPAD]], travelled to the US to coordinate production of SPADs with [[Curtiss Aeroplane and Motor Company|Curtiss]] until the project was cancelled with the end of the war. He then worked with [[Packard]] on automobiles for a year in 1919 before working as a civilian with the [[United States Army Air Corps]] with Verville, who convinced him to work at Buhl.<ref name=Bleneau1>Bleneau, Les berlines Buhl  (Premi\u00e8re partie), p.2-3</ref> As a Frenchman, he was familiar with the advantages of the sesquiplane concept as it was a popular configuration in France, such as with the [[Breguet 26T]] airliner, but rare in the US.<ref name=Bleneau1/>\n\nThe fuselage framework, lower wing and [[empennage]] were welded [[41xx steel|chromium-molybdenum alloy steel]] tubes faired with wooden battens, with the lower wing integral with the fuselage structure.<ref name=Juptner1962p44/> The upper wings were built around spruce spars, with built up ribs made from spruce and plywood. The entire airframe was covered with [[Aircraft dope|dope]]d aircraft-grade fabric.<ref name=Juptner1962p44/>\nTo reduce control forces, projecting aerodynamic balance horns on rudder and elevators, while inset aerodynamic horns were used on the ailerons, which were fitted to the upper wing only.<ref name=Juptner1962p44/> To provide trim control, the rudder was ground adjustable while the elevators could be adjustable in flight.<ref name=Juptner1962p44/> Depending on the models, three different designs of lower wings were used - either constant chord with reversed N struts on the CA-5, a triangular wing with a vee strut on the CA-3, CA-6 and CA-8, or a constant chord wing with two rigged struts, on Canadian built CA-6Ms.\nAll were conventional [[sesquiplane]]s with fully enclosed [[cockpit]]s, fitted with dual controls in front of a passenger cabin. The number in the designation generally referred to the number of occupants as originally designed, with a larger number of seats corresponding to a larger airframe. \nThe first variant built was the CA-5, while later variants had a much slimmer [[fuselage]], a greatly improved windscreen design and a modified cockpit. The CA-5 had the undercarriage legs connected to the fuselage, and part way out from the fuselage, on the lower wing. The CA-3 had the undercarriage mounted solely to the fuselage, while the CA-6 and CA-8 had additional bracing struts from the top of the fuselage to the lower wing which allowed the undercarriage track to be widened. Buhl asserted that its undercarriage design reduced camber changes during landing, and the tendency to yaw due to bumpy ground. The CA-6 was certified to use [[Edo Aircraft Corporation|Edo J-5300 floats]].<ref name=CAHS>Anderson, 1990, p.20</ref>\n\n===Canadian production===\n[[File:Buhl Airsedan CA-6M CF-OAR, Ontario Provincial Air Service, front port side.jpg|thumb|Canadian-built Buhl CA-6M Airsedan with enlarged lower wings.]]\nAfter Buhl had ceased operations in 1932 due to declining sales as the [[Great Depression]] deepened, the drawings and jigs were purchased by the [[Ontario Provincial Air Service|Ontario Provincial Air Service (OPAS)]] in [[Canada]] who then built four CA-6M's for use as fire spotting aircraft at their facility in [[Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario|Sault Ste. Marie]] between 1935 and 1937. These differed from the original aircraft in having [[Canadian Vickers]] floats, a new fin and rudder and larger lower wings.<ref name=OPAS>{{cite web|author=Various|title=Government Of Ontario Buhl Air Sedan|url=https://www.bushplane.com/opas-aircraft/histories-opas-buhl/|work=www.bushplane.com|date=2011\u20132018|accessdate=15 January 2020}}</ref> Due to the excessive weight of the Canadian-Vickers built floats, the first [[Ontario Provincial Air Service]]-built CA-6M refused to leave the water until given a more powerful {{cvt|440|hp}} [[Pratt & Whitney Wasp]] engine.\n\n==Operational history==\n[[File:Buhl CA-3C The Angelino Junior NC7448 Oakland-Cleveland race August 1929.jpg|thumb|''The Angelino Junior'' after winning the 1929 Oakland-Cleveland race]]\n[[File:Buhl CA-5 Air Sedan NR3763 The Angeleno in flight.jpg|thumb|''The Angeleno'' (L) being refueled in flight from a [[Curtiss Carrier Pigeon]]]]\n[[File:Buhl CA-6 Air Sedan.

P. Knope]] navigating, was one of the entrants in the disastrous August 1927 [[Dole Air Race]] and like many competitors, was lost at sea.<ref name=Aerofiles/><ref name=Juptner1962p44/> Two other aviators lost their lives in a Swallow monoplane while searching for them. <ref name=Juptner1962p44/>\n\nA CA-3C Sport Airsedan NC7448, named ''Angelino Jr'' was piloted by [[Loren Mendell]] to first place in the [[National Air Race|Oakland-Cleveland Air Derby during the 1929 National Air Races]].<ref name=Aerofiles/>\n\n''The Angeleno'', CA-5A NR3763, set an endurance record of 246 hours, 43 minutes and 2 seconds on July 12th 1929 using [[inflight refuelling]].<ref name=Juptner1962p96/> They had just barely beaten the previous record when trash tossed from the aircraft jammed the tail and ended their run - and worse, their record would be bested within two weeks with a [[Curtiss Robin]].<ref name=Parks>Parks, 2015, p.25</ref>\n\nAnother Airsedan, a CA-6 Special NC9628 named ''Spokane Sun God'' made the first nonstop round-trip crossing the United States by air.

One example completed the first transcontinental non-stop roundtrip flight, made in 1929 by the CA-6 ''Spokane Sun-God'',<ref name=Meister>{{cite web|last=Meister Jr.|first=Richard L.|url=http://www.aerofiles.com/sungod.html|title=The Flight of the Buhl Airsedan Spokane Sun-God|date=February 2000|accessdate=28 January 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> and the first [[Pope]] to have flown did so in a Buhl Airsedan.<ref name=goldenwingsmuseum/>\n\n==Design and development==\nThe Airsedan series were designed by [[Etienne Dormoy]] following the departure of [[Alfred V. Verville]] from Buhl, with whom he had worked previously. Dormoy had worked with [[Deperdussin]] before [[World War one]], flew combat operations during the war before returning to work with [[Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 pour l'aviation et ses d\u00e9riv\u00e9s|SPAD]], travelled to the US to coordinate production of SPADs with [[Curtiss Aeroplane and Motor Company|Curtiss]] until the project was cancelled with the end of the war. He then worked with [[Packard]] on automobiles for a year in 1919 before working as a civilian with the [[United States Army Air Corps]] with Verville, who convinced him to work at Buhl.<ref name=Bleneau1>Bleneau, Les berlines Buhl  (Premi\u00e8re partie), p.2-3</ref> As a Frenchman, he was familiar with the advantages of the sesquiplane concept as it was a popular configuration in France, such as with the [[Breguet 26T]] airliner, but rare in the US.<ref name=Bleneau1/>\n\nThe fuselage framework, lower wing and [[empennage]] were welded [[41xx steel|chromium-molybdenum alloy steel]] tubes faired with wooden battens, with the lower wing integral with the fuselage structure.<ref name=Juptner1962p44/> The upper wings were built around spruce spars, with built up ribs made from spruce and plywood. The entire airframe was covered with [[doped]] aircraft-grade fabric.<ref name=Juptner1962p44/>\nTo reduce control forces, projecting aerodynamic balance horns on rudder and elevators, while inset aerodynamic horns were used on the ailerons, which were fitted to the upper wing only.<ref name=Juptner1962p44/> To provide trim control, the rudder was ground adjustable while the elevators could be adjustable in flight.<ref name=Juptner1962p44/> Depending on the models, three different designs of lower wings were used - either constant chord with reversed N struts on the CA-5, a triangular wing with a vee strut on the CA-3, CA-6 and CA-8, or a constant chord wing with two rigged struts, on Canadian built CA-6Ms.\nAll were conventional [[sesquiplane]]s with fully enclosed [[cockpit]]s, fitted with dual controls in front of a passenger cabin. The number in the designation generally referred to the number of occupants as originally designed, with a larger number of seats corresponding to a larger airframe. \nThe first variant built was the CA-5, while later variants had a much slimmer [[fuselage]], a greatly improved windscreen design and a modified cockpit. The CA-5 had the undercarriage legs connected to the fuselage, and part way out from the fuselage, on the lower wing. The CA-3 had the undercarriage mounted solely to the fuselage, while the CA-6 and CA-8 had additional bracing struts from the top of the fuselage to the lower wing which allowed the undercarriage track to be widened. Buhl asserted that its undercarriage design reduced camber changes during landing, and the tendency to yaw due to bumpy ground. The CA-6 was certified to use [[Edo Aircraft Corporation|Edo J-5300 floats]].<ref name=CAHS>Anderson, 1990, p.20</ref>\n\n===Canadian production===\n[[File:Buhl Airsedan CA-6M CF-OAR, Ontario Provincial Air Service, front port side.jpg|thumb|Canadian-built Buhl CA-6M Airsedan with enlarged lower wings.]]\nAfter Buhl had ceased operations in 1932 due to declining sales as the [[Great Depression]] deepened, the drawings and jigs were purchased by the [[Ontario Provincial Air Service|Ontario Provincial Air Service (OPAS)]] in [[Canada]] who then built four CA-6M's for use as fire spotting aircraft at their facility in [[Sault Ste.

It is often referred to as '''''Grand Prix 1''''', '''''MicroProse Grand Prix''''', or just '''''F1GP'''''. Although the game itself was not affiliated officially with the [[FIA]] or any Formula One drivers, team liveries and driver helmets were accurate to represent the [[1991 Formula One season|1991 season]], but the names were fictional. The game is a simulation of [[Formula One]] racing at the time and was noted for its 3D graphics,  remarkably high framerate (25 fps) and attention to detail, in particular the players ability to edit the teams and drivers and set up their car to their own personal specifications. The game was ranked the 27th best game of all time by ''[[Amiga Power]]''.<ref>Amiga Power magazine issue 64, Future Publishing, August 1996</ref>\n\nGrand Prix's success spawned three sequels, called ''[[Grand Prix 2 (game)|Grand Prix 2]]'', ''[[Grand Prix 3]]'' and ''[[Grand Prix 4]]''. These were exclusively PC games.\n\n==Impact on the racing simulation genre==\n{{Essay-like|section|date=March 2020}}\n\nAfter Papyrus' ''[[Indianapolis 500: The Simulation]]'', which was released three years earlier, it was the second serious 3D [[Polygon (computer graphics)|polygon]]-based racing sim (that is, without [[Texture mapping|textures]], except some for the scenery in the PC version). Although Indy 500 was strictly speaking first in pioneering many novel features, ''F1GP'' would make a bigger overall impression and impact because it featured Formula One race cars, and because it offered the player a complete season to compete in, featuring 16 F1 tracks to Papyrus' 1 track in Indy 500.\n\nWhen Indy 500 and ''F1GP'' appeared, they were the very first to implement something that resembled \"real world\" racing physics, accurate track modelling and car handling that required skills somewhat similar to real-world driving skills to perform well. Both were also the first to offer meaningful options to tune the behaviour of the cars. Although not quite on the level of later simulations, the most important variables, such as [[gear ratio]]s, [[Tire|tyre]] compounds and [[Airfoil|wing settings]] were available to tune and, more importantly, proved to make an actual difference when driving. Important were also the functional rearview mirrors and an \"instant replay\" system with a wide range of adjustable camera settings not seen in other games of the era. In addition, action replays would automatically change camera position and angle according to what was happening on track, a feature which is unavailable in leading F1 licensed games in 2019.\n\nDespite several continuity hiccups, the game offered a completely new experience for players at the time. The accurately modelled tracks meant that the player could actually recognise their location on the real-life circuit. The detailed physics engine provided a more realistic driving experience than had been seen before, drivers could easily experience the differences in handling depending on how you entered a corner and how soon or late you accelerated out of it. Unlike other racing simulations of the time, the accuracy of the simulation actually made the 1/1000 of a second chronometer meaningful, as races could be won or lost by a few thousandths of a second. Vitally, the combination of graphics and physics meant players could actually \"feel\" whether they were driving fast or slow, and could predict how the car would respond. Even details such as tyre wear were modelled throughout the race, qualifying tyres are an extreme example of this: players could not drive more than a couple of laps without beginning to lose grip and eventually spinning out on nearly every corner. \nTogether with the 16 tracks and the atmosphere-packed rendition of complete Grand Prix weekends, it made ''F1GP'' a favourite with Formula One and racing sim fans for many years, and is still referred to occasionally in current reviews as a classic benchmark.\n\nTwo more aspects worth mentioning are the \"driving help\" features, the ability to drive easily with the keyboard or another controller, and the availability of automatic transmission on most cars. ''F1GP'' was built on a system that allowed for an almost perfect learning-curve. Depending on which driving assistances were activated, the game covered playability from a pure arcade-racer level up to the most advanced sim-level available at the time. Players could choose to activate innovative help-functions like \"[[Disc brake|brake]]-assistance\" which would apply the brakes in time for a corner, displaying an \"ideal line\" on the tarmac to help learning the layout of a track, suggestions for the optimum gear, and others. Perhaps the most impressive achievements in that respect were the \"steering help\" and \"[[throttle]] assistance\". At the time ''F1GP'' was released, analogue steering wheels were far from mainstream. Even [[joystick]]s were still mostly digital, and in that respect no different from a keyboard. In order to compensate for the strict ''on-off'' nature of digital controllers, Geoff Crammond implemented a method to 'smoothen' the inputs. \"Throttle assistance\" prevented wheel spin when going on the gas. \"Steering help\" smoothened the steering actions (as an indication, one would experience cars steering slightly into corners all on their own when this help was activated). This was a subtle exercise, as it could give the impression of cars driving themselves when implemented too strongly. As experience showed, a balance was found. Which turned ''F1GP'', and its successors, into a racing game that could be fully enjoyed and played well via digital input devices.\n\nAs an aside, it is illustrative for the depth of the game that people actually learned to overcome the need for \"Throttle Assistance\" when using the keyboard, and discovered that disabling it and applying the right techniques enabled \"digital\" drivers to go faster (at the expense of tyre wear). To this day F1GP remains a unique and world leading example in providing a learning curve that caters from the utter driving novice to the very advanced sim-driver.\n\n==Limitations==\nDespite these great achievements, ''F1GP'' also contained a flaw that was considered irrelevant at first, but would later seriously compromise the potential of the game and its successors.\n\nGeoff Crammond wrote the game long before the era of [[DirectX]], [[OpenGL]] and 3D acceleration video cards. So ''F1GP'' was built around a proprietary 3D engine that ran in software. This engine was set up in such a way that a fixed frame rate had to be chosen (up to 25.6 frame/s on the PC version), and the game would at all times try to render the specified number of frames.\n\nThe result was that the engine would never drop frames when the CPU couldn't handle the rendering in realtime. Instead, gametime itself was slowed down. The software itself provided an option to display the CPU-load, pressing the \"o\" key. When this was higher than 100%, the game was no longer working in realtime. This would become known in the community as the infamous \"slow-motion driving\". Since the rendering was obviously dependent on the complexity of the scene, this also meant that one could experience slowdowns of the action only on certain parts of certain tracks, or when there were lots of cars around (for example at the start).\n\nThe game did provide options to eliminate trackside details; (CTRL-D), and in addition one could also choose a lower framerate to avoid the problem altogether. It also has to be understood that gamers didn't have quite the same expectations of framerates as nowadays. The unmatched quality of the 3D representations in itself was enough to impress people, so the actual impact on single-player gaming was not seen as important.\n\nLater in the game's life, this effect became a larger issue. The Grand Prix series never offered solid multiplayer network support, largely due to this design choice. \"Real time\" in the game could differ between different players, and this conflicted with the all-important synchronization in a multiplayer context. The effect could also be misused to artificially slow down the action, and exploit the extra reaction time that became available to the player that way. Although largely irrelevant if one played the game on one's own, it caused a lot of trouble for online competitions (see below).\n\nSuccessors [[Grand Prix 3]] and [[Grand Prix 4]] offered LAN-play and were even hacked to be playable over the [[Internet]], but never performed reasonably. Even when the first boom of 3D acceleration chipsets revolutionized gaming, the concept was not reworked as this would have required a large rewrite of the game engine, and remained a problem (although less so because of the available computer power).\n\nAnother exploitable flaw lay in the physics engine, which only took account of horizontal collisions and ignored vertical velocity when calculating damage. Thus, it was possible to use the rumble strips on some tracks to launch the car into the air, bypassing chicanes, and land without damaging the car.\n\n==Historical online gaming and community==\n''F1GP'' was among the first wave of games that had a busy online community. The first competitions were organized via online services like [[Compuserve]] in 1993, with driver Ivan establishing a secure presence at the top of leaderboards. F1GP crossed over to the wider Internet once these became mainstream.\n\nThe racing didn't actually happen online. ''F1GP'' only offered [[modem]] play. Thus, the competitions were based on submitted save-games of races and practice laps. These were then used in competitions around complete (or partial) races on the one hand, and so called \"[[Hotlap]] Competitions\" on the other hand. Often, the races followed the schedule of the real world Formula One competition.\n\nThe community spawned a host of mods, making the game highly customizable for its time. Liveries, car-performance and the performance of the computer-opponents, camera-settings and many other settings could be edited. First attempts at a track-editor emerged, but this would only become reality after the arrival of the successor ''Grand Prix 2''. In 1994, the Amiga version of F1GP benefitted from a game editor called F1GP-Ed. Whilst this was not the first editor made for the Amiga<ref>https://www.howtoretro.com/f1gp-amiga-review/</ref>, it proved to be the most evolved and widely adopted over time.\n\nBecause of the possibilities to edit the performance of the car, or to make other aspects of the game favour the player, there were also a lot of utilities to check for cheats. These could handle just about every possible trick that was available, except one: the mentioned \"slow-motion driving\" effect. The game didn't store the [[Load (computing)|CPU-load]] data, which could be displayed via a function key, in any save game file. So there was no way to exclude the possibility that someone maximized the graphics detail on purpose to force a slowdown of the action.\n\nIn practice, ''F1GP'' was already an 'older' game when online competitions appeared. This meant that most used computers could easily handle the highest detail at the highest [[Frame rate|framerate]]. As such, ''F1GP''-based competitions were actually not hit by the \"slow-mo\" cheat. Both because the communities were small, and because the CPU-power surplus meant that the effect and its possible usefulness as a way to cheat were less well known.\n\nIts successor ''Grand Prix 2'' though, was notorious for its high CPU-demands. When it appeared, there were no systems available that could handle it at full detail. Most people had difficulty finding a good compromise between details and smooth framerate, and the majority were likely playing in moderate slow-motion without being aware.\n\nWhen the ''Grand Prix 2'' community materialized and exploded far beyond what ''F1GP'' ever offered, it soon became apparent that some participants in the competitions submitted results that were totally unrealistic. [[Telemetry]]-data files even showed typical signs of \"slow-motion driving\" (like impossibly fast gearchange speeds) but there was no way to unambiguously prove it.\n\nThis problem kept bugging the community for several years until the utility GP2LAP was developed to monitor and log the CPU load dynamically during the driving.\n\n==Play by Mail Mode==\nA special PBM or Play by Mail mode was introduced in ''F1GP''. Players would choose one of the drivers for the particular race and when their turn was up save the game onto floppy disk. The disk would then be sent via second class mail to other participants in the event to continue with their turn. This would again be saved and the disk mailed out to the next participant. The PBM mode could extend to include a full seasons championship.\n\n== Release ==\nA port of ''Formula One Grand Prix'' for the [[Atari Jaguar]] was in development and planned to be published by MicroProse, but it was never released.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Ripper|first=The|url=https://archive.org/stream/Gamefan_Vol_2_Issue_03#page/n122/mode/1up|title=Europa!|magazine=[[GameFan]]|volume=2|issue=3|publisher=Shinno Media|date=February 1994|page=123|access-date=13 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190104222106/https://archive.org/stream/Gamefan_Vol_2_Issue_03#page/n122/mode/1up#page/n122/mode/1up|archive-date=4 January 2019|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://download.abandonware.org/magazines/Generation%204/generation4_numero064/gen4%20-%20n64%20-mars%201994%20-%20page%20042.jpg|title=News - La Jaguar ronronne - On attend sur Jaguar|magazine=[[:fr:Gen4|G\u00e9n\u00e9ration 4]]|issue=64|publisher=Computec Media France|date=March 1994|page=42|lang=fr|access-date=13 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180925104341/http://download.abandonware.org/magazines/Generation%204/generation4_numero064/gen4%20-%20n64%20-mars%201994%20-%20page%20042.jpg|archive-date=25 September 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://retrocdn.net/index.php?title=File%3AVideoGames_DE_1994-05.pdf&page=75|title=Warpzone - Demn\u00e4chst f\u00fcr Eure Konsolen|magazine=[[:de:Video Games|Video Games]]|issue=30|publisher=Future-Verlag|date=May 1994|page=79|lang=de|access-date=13 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180804201620/https://retrocdn.net/index.php?title=File%3AVideoGames_DE_1994-05.pdf&page=75|archive-date=4 August 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://retrocdn.net/index.php?title=File%3AVideoGames_DE_1994-07.pdf&page=32|title=Warpzone - Jaguar - Angek\u00fcndigte Jaguar-Spiele|magazine=[[:de:Video Games|Video Games]]|issue=32|publisher=Future-Verlag|date=July 1994|page=32|lang=de|access-date=13 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180804201143/https://retrocdn.net/index.php?title=File%3AVideoGames_DE_1994-07.pdf&page=32|archive-date=4 August 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' stated that \"''World Circuit'' is a winner, going away at the finish\".<ref name=\"poulter199207\">{{cite news | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1992&pub=2&id=96 | title=True to Formula (One, That Is!) | work=Computer Gaming World | date=July 1992 | accessdate=24 November 2013 | author=Poulter, Wallace | pages=70 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203001645/http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1992&pub=2&id=96 | archive-date=3 December 2013 | url-status=live | df=dmy-all }}</ref> In 1993 the magazine named it and ''[[Star Wars: X-Wing]]'' Simulation Game of the Year,<ref name=\"cgw199310\">{{cite news | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1993&pub=2&id=111 | title=Computer Gaming World's Game of the Year Awards | work=Computer Gaming World | date=October 1993 | accessdate=25 March 2016 | pages=70\u201374 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160316201111/http://cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1993&pub=2&id=111 | archive-date=16 March 2016 | url-status=live | df=dmy-all }}</ref> and in 1994 reported that of four new racing games, \"there is not a ''World Circuit'' in the lot\".<ref name=\"goble199408\">{{Cite magazine\n |last         = Goble\n |first        = Gordon\n |date         = August 1994\n |title        = Four More For The Road\n |url          = http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1994&pub=2&id=121\n |magazine     = Computer Gaming World\n |pages        = 60\u201364\n |access-date  = 21 November 2017\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20180102213537/http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1994&pub=2&id=121\n |archive-date = 2 January 2018\n |url-status     = live\n |df           = dmy-all\n}}</ref> In 1994, ''[[PC Gamer UK]]'' named it the 29th best computer game of all time.

This portal<ref>{{cite web|url=https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/f1gpwc/info|title=Yahoo! Groups|website=groups.yahoo.com|accessdate=17 July 2018}}</ref> was originally designed to augment SimRacingWorld, promoting community discussion and allowing casual players to remain aware of new developments. However, it has since expanded to contain a selection of files. Up to 1 April 2018, all new community developments were made available via this portal. However, it is clear that there was significantly more material on the SimRacingWorld website than on the group and thus it cannot be seen as a complete replacement.\n\nA new F1GP community website<ref>{{cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/view/f1gpwc|title=F1GP|website=sites.google.com|accessdate=17 July 2018}}</ref> was launched on 1 April 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/f1gpwc/conversations/messages/550|title=Yahoo!

The discussion group is regularly updated with new developments.\n\nOne of the focuses of these communities has been on online multiplayer competitions. The ERace is an online multiplayer competition which uses the ''play by mail'' mode to facilitate a championship. This contest was announced on 11 October 2011<ref>{{cite web|url=https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/f1gpwc/conversations/messages/377|title=Yahoo! Groups|website=groups.yahoo.com|accessdate=17 July 2018}}</ref> and is still running as of the current date. Competition updates are regularly posted on the Yahoo group portal for all those interested in the game to read.\n\nIn addition to the ''play by mail'' mode, a competition using a direct [[Internet]] connection between two players has also been tested. The online gaming mode utilizes the game's built-in [[modem]] play and the serial port virtualization capabilities of the [[DOSBox]] emulator program. This method of playing ''F1GP'' over a [[LAN]] connection or over the [[Internet]] was originally tested in 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/f1gpwc/conversations/messages/250|title=Yahoo!

However, three developments in particular deserve notable mention. The construction of an [[open-source software|open-source]] game editor \"Chequered Flag\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://chequeredflag.sourceforge.net|title=Chequered Flag - An open-source attempt to create a universal F1GP/WC editor|website=chequeredflag.sourceforge.net|accessdate=17 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061206030902/http://chequeredflag.sourceforge.net/|archive-date=6 December 2006|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> is the first of these as it was a project of significant scale, designed to unify previous editing tools and introduce new game modification facilities. Initial progress was good and a number of screenshots were released on 3 September 2006 to give an indication of the editor construction state. This was followed on 23 December 2006 by the first release of the editor under version 0.1.0. This early version focused only on providing modification facilities for track editing. A more complete set of editing tools was anticipated, although this remains the only released version as of the current date.\n\n[[File:ArgEditor screenshot.png|thumb|ArgEditor screenshot]]\nThe second significant development revolves around the creation of a modern game editor \"ArgEditor\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://argtools.com/argeditor|title=ArgEditor|website=argtools.com|accessdate=17 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180716000147/http://argtools.com/argeditor|archive-date=16 July 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> It represents a fresh take on an F1GP editor which works on all recent versions of the [[Windows operating system]].

It is often referred to as '''''Grand Prix 1''''', '''''MicroProse Grand Prix''''', or just '''''F1GP'''''. Although the game itself was not affiliated officially with the [[FIA]] or any Formula One drivers, team liveries and driver helmets were accurate to represent the [[1991 Formula One season|1991 season]], but the names were fictional. The game is a simulation of [[Formula One]] racing at the time and was noted for its 3D graphics,  remarkably high framerate (25 fps) and attention to detail, in particular the players ability to edit the teams and drivers and set up their car to their own personal specifications. The game was ranked the 27th best game of all time by ''[[Amiga Power]]''.<ref>Amiga Power magazine issue 64, Future Publishing, August 1996</ref>\n\nGrand Prix's success spawned three sequels, called ''[[Grand Prix 2 (game)|Grand Prix 2]]'', ''[[Grand Prix 3]]'' and ''[[Grand Prix 4]]''. These were exclusively PC games.\n\n==Impact on the racing simulation genre==\n{{Essay-like|section|date=March 2020}}\n\nAfter Papyrus' ''[[Indianapolis 500: The Simulation]]'', which was released three years earlier, it was the second serious 3D [[Polygon (computer graphics)|polygon]]-based racing sim (that is, without [[Texture mapping|textures]], except some for the scenery in the PC version). Although Indy 500 was strictly speaking first in pioneering many novel features, ''F1GP'' would make a bigger overall impression and impact because it featured Formula One race cars, and because it offered the player a complete season to compete in, featuring 16 F1 tracks to Papyrus' 1 track in Indy 500.\n\nWhen Indy 500 and ''F1GP'' appeared, they were the very first to implement something that resembled \"real world\" racing physics, accurate track modelling and car handling that required skills somewhat similar to real-world driving skills to perform well. Both were also the first to offer meaningful options to tune the behaviour of the cars. Although not quite on the level of later simulations, the most important variables, such as [[gear ratio]]s, [[Tire|tyre]] compounds and [[Airfoil|wing settings]] were available to tune and, more importantly, proved to make an actual difference when driving. Important were also the functional rearview mirrors and an \"instant replay\" system with a wide range of adjustable camera settings not seen in other games of the era. In addition, action replays would automatically change camera position and angle according to what was happening on track, a feature which is unavailable in leading F1 licensed games in 2019.\n\nDespite several continuity hiccups, the game offered a completely new experience for players at the time. The accurately modelled tracks meant that the player could actually recognise their location on the real-life circuit. The detailed physics engine provided a more realistic driving experience than had been seen before, drivers could easily experience the differences in handling depending on how you entered a corner and how soon or late you accelerated out of it. Unlike other racing simulations of the time, the accuracy of the simulation actually made the 1/1000 of a second chronometer meaningful, as races could be won or lost by a few thousandths of a second. Vitally, the combination of graphics and physics meant players could actually \"feel\" whether they were driving fast or slow, and could predict how the car would respond. Even details such as tyre wear were modelled throughout the race, qualifying tyres are an extreme example of this: players could not drive more than a couple of laps without beginning to lose grip and eventually spinning out on nearly every corner. \nTogether with the 16 tracks and the atmosphere-packed rendition of complete Grand Prix weekends, it made ''F1GP'' a favourite with Formula One and racing sim fans for many years, and is still referred to occasionally in current reviews as a classic benchmark.\n\nTwo more aspects worth mentioning are the \"driving help\" features, the ability to drive easily with the keyboard or another controller, and the availability of automatic transmission on most cars. ''F1GP'' was built on a system that allowed for an almost perfect learning-curve. Depending on which driving assistances were activated, the game covered playability from a pure arcade-racer level up to the most advanced sim-level available at the time. Players could choose to activate innovative help-functions like \"[[Disc brake|brake]]-assistance\" which would apply the brakes in time for a corner, displaying an \"ideal line\" on the tarmac to help learning the layout of a track, suggestions for the optimum gear, and others. Perhaps the most impressive achievements in that respect were the \"steering help\" and \"[[throttle]] assistance\". At the time ''F1GP'' was released, analogue steering wheels were far from mainstream. Even [[joystick]]s were still mostly digital, and in that respect no different from a keyboard. In order to compensate for the strict ''on-off'' nature of digital controllers, Geoff Crammond implemented a method to 'smoothen' the inputs. \"Throttle assistance\" prevented wheel spin when going on the gas. \"Steering help\" smoothened the steering actions (as an indication, one would experience cars steering slightly into corners all on their own when this help was activated). This was a subtle exercise, as it could give the impression of cars driving themselves when implemented too strongly. As experience showed, a balance was found. Which turned ''F1GP'', and its successors, into a racing game that could be fully enjoyed and played well via digital input devices.\n\nAs an aside, it is illustrative for the depth of the game that people actually learned to overcome the need for \"Throttle Assistance\" when using the keyboard, and discovered that disabling it and applying the right techniques enabled \"digital\" drivers to go faster (at the expense of tyre wear). To this day F1GP remains a unique and world leading example in providing a learning curve that caters from the utter driving novice to the very advanced sim-driver.\n\n==Limitations==\nDespite these great achievements, ''F1GP'' also contained a flaw that was considered irrelevant at first, but would later seriously compromise the potential of the game and its successors.\n\nGeoff Crammond wrote the game long before the era of [[DirectX]], [[OpenGL]] and 3D acceleration video cards. So ''F1GP'' was built around a proprietary 3D engine that ran in software. This engine was set up in such a way that a fixed frame rate had to be chosen (up to 25.6 frame/s on the PC version), and the game would at all times try to render the specified number of frames.\n\nThe result was that the engine would never drop frames when the CPU couldn't handle the rendering in realtime. Instead, gametime itself was slowed down. The software itself provided an option to display the CPU-load, pressing the \"o\" key. When this was higher than 100%, the game was no longer working in realtime. This would become known in the community as the infamous \"slow-motion driving\". Since the rendering was obviously dependent on the complexity of the scene, this also meant that one could experience slowdowns of the action only on certain parts of certain tracks, or when there were lots of cars around (for example at the start).\n\nThe game did provide options to eliminate trackside details; (CTRL-D), and in addition one could also choose a lower framerate to avoid the problem altogether. It also has to be understood that gamers didn't have quite the same expectations of framerates as nowadays. The unmatched quality of the 3D representations in itself was enough to impress people, so the actual impact on single-player gaming was not seen as important.\n\nLater in the game's life, this effect became a larger issue. The Grand Prix series never offered solid multiplayer network support, largely due to this design choice. \"Real time\" in the game could differ between different players, and this conflicted with the all-important synchronization in a multiplayer context. The effect could also be misused to artificially slow down the action, and exploit the extra reaction time that became available to the player that way. Although largely irrelevant if one played the game on one's own, it caused a lot of trouble for online competitions (see below).\n\nSuccessors [[Grand Prix 3]] and [[Grand Prix 4]] offered LAN-play and were even hacked to be playable over the [[Internet]], but never performed reasonably. Even when the first boom of 3D acceleration chipsets revolutionized gaming, the concept was not reworked as this would have required a large rewrite of the game engine, and remained a problem (although less so because of the available computer power).\n\nAnother exploitable flaw lay in the physics engine, which only took account of horizontal collisions and ignored vertical velocity when calculating damage. Thus, it was possible to use the rumble strips on some tracks to launch the car into the air, bypassing chicanes, and land without damaging the car.\n\n==Historical online gaming and community==\n''F1GP'' was among the first wave of games that had a busy online community. The first competitions were organized via online services like [[Compuserve]] in 1993, with driver Ivan establishing a secure presence at the top of leaderboards. F1GP crossed over to the wider Internet once these became mainstream.\n\nThe racing didn't actually happen online. ''F1GP'' only offered [[modem]] play. Thus, the competitions were based on submitted save-games of races and practice laps. These were then used in competitions around complete (or partial) races on the one hand, and so called \"[[Hotlap]] Competitions\" on the other hand. Often, the races followed the schedule of the real world Formula One competition.\n\nThe community spawned a host of mods, making the game highly customizable for its time. Liveries, car-performance and the performance of the computer-opponents, camera-settings and many other settings could be edited. First attempts at a track-editor emerged, but this would only become reality after the arrival of the successor ''Grand Prix 2''. In 1994, the Amiga version of F1GP benefitted from a game editor called F1GP-Ed. Whilst this was not the first editor made for the Amiga<ref>https://www.howtoretro.com/f1gp-amiga-review/</ref>, it proved to be the most evolved and widely adopted over time.\n\nBecause of the possibilities to edit the performance of the car, or to make other aspects of the game favour the player, there were also a lot of utilities to check for cheats. These could handle just about every possible trick that was available, except one: the mentioned \"slow-motion driving\" effect. The game didn't store the [[Load (computing)|CPU-load]] data, which could be displayed via a function key, in any save game file. So there was no way to exclude the possibility that someone maximized the graphics detail on purpose to force a slowdown of the action.\n\nIn practice, ''F1GP'' was already an 'older' game when online competitions appeared. This meant that most used computers could easily handle the highest detail at the highest [[Frame rate|framerate]]. As such, ''F1GP''-based competitions were actually not hit by the \"slow-mo\" cheat. Both because the communities were small, and because the CPU-power surplus meant that the effect and its possible usefulness as a way to cheat were less well known.\n\nIts successor ''Grand Prix 2'' though, was notorious for its high CPU-demands. When it appeared, there were no systems available that could handle it at full detail. Most people had difficulty finding a good compromise between details and smooth framerate, and the majority were likely playing in moderate slow-motion without being aware.\n\nWhen the ''Grand Prix 2'' community materialized and exploded far beyond what ''F1GP'' ever offered, it soon became apparent that some participants in the competitions submitted results that were totally unrealistic. [[Telemetry]]-data files even showed typical signs of \"slow-motion driving\" (like impossibly fast gearchange speeds) but there was no way to unambiguously prove it.\n\nThis problem kept bugging the community for several years until the utility GP2LAP was developed to monitor and log the CPU load dynamically during the driving.\n\n==Play by Mail Mode==\nA special PBM or Play by Mail mode was introduced in ''F1GP''. Players would choose one of the drivers for the particular race and when their turn was up save the game onto floppy disk. The disk would then be sent via second class mail to other participants in the event to continue with their turn. This would again be saved and the disk mailed out to the next participant. The PBM mode could extend to include a full seasons championship.\n\n== Release ==\nA port of ''Formula One Grand Prix'' for the [[Atari Jaguar]] was in development and planned to be published by MicroProse, but it was never released.<ref>{{cite magazine|last=Ripper|first=The|url=https://archive.org/stream/Gamefan_Vol_2_Issue_03#page/n122/mode/1up|title=Europa!|magazine=[[GameFan]]|volume=2|issue=3|publisher=Shinno Media|date=February 1994|page=123|access-date=13 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190104222106/https://archive.org/stream/Gamefan_Vol_2_Issue_03#page/n122/mode/1up#page/n122/mode/1up|archive-date=4 January 2019|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=http://download.abandonware.org/magazines/Generation%204/generation4_numero064/gen4%20-%20n64%20-mars%201994%20-%20page%20042.jpg|title=News - La Jaguar ronronne - On attend sur Jaguar|magazine=[[:fr:Gen4|G\u00e9n\u00e9ration 4]]|issue=64|publisher=Computec Media France|date=March 1994|page=42|lang=fr|access-date=13 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180925104341/http://download.abandonware.org/magazines/Generation%204/generation4_numero064/gen4%20-%20n64%20-mars%201994%20-%20page%20042.jpg|archive-date=25 September 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://retrocdn.net/index.php?title=File%3AVideoGames_DE_1994-05.pdf&page=75|title=Warpzone - Demn\u00e4chst f\u00fcr Eure Konsolen|magazine=[[:de:Video Games|Video Games]]|issue=30|publisher=Future-Verlag|date=May 1994|page=79|lang=de|access-date=13 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180804201620/https://retrocdn.net/index.php?title=File%3AVideoGames_DE_1994-05.pdf&page=75|archive-date=4 August 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine|url=https://retrocdn.net/index.php?title=File%3AVideoGames_DE_1994-07.pdf&page=32|title=Warpzone - Jaguar - Angek\u00fcndigte Jaguar-Spiele|magazine=[[:de:Video Games|Video Games]]|issue=32|publisher=Future-Verlag|date=July 1994|page=32|lang=de|access-date=13 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180804201143/https://retrocdn.net/index.php?title=File%3AVideoGames_DE_1994-07.pdf&page=32|archive-date=4 August 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n==Reception==\n''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' stated that \"''World Circuit'' is a winner, going away at the finish\".<ref name=\"poulter199207\">{{cite news | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1992&pub=2&id=96 | title=True to Formula (One, That Is!) | work=Computer Gaming World | date=July 1992 | accessdate=24 November 2013 | author=Poulter, Wallace | pages=70 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203001645/http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1992&pub=2&id=96 | archive-date=3 December 2013 | url-status=live | df=dmy-all }}</ref> In 1993 the magazine named it and ''[[Star Wars: X-Wing]]'' Simulation Game of the Year,<ref name=\"cgw199310\">{{cite news | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1993&pub=2&id=111 | title=Computer Gaming World's Game of the Year Awards | work=Computer Gaming World | date=October 1993 | accessdate=25 March 2016 | pages=70\u201374 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160316201111/http://cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1993&pub=2&id=111 | archive-date=16 March 2016 | url-status=live | df=dmy-all }}</ref> and in 1994 reported that of four new racing games, \"there is not a ''World Circuit'' in the lot\".<ref name=\"goble199408\">{{Cite magazine\n |last         = Goble\n |first        = Gordon\n |date         = August 1994\n |title        = Four More For The Road\n |url          = http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1994&pub=2&id=121\n |magazine     = Computer Gaming World\n |pages        = 60\u201364\n |access-date  = 21 November 2017\n |archive-url  = https://web.archive.org/web/20180102213537/http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1994&pub=2&id=121\n |archive-date = 2 January 2018\n |url-status     = live\n |df           = dmy-all\n}}</ref> In 1994, ''[[PC Gamer UK]]'' named it the 29th best computer game of all time.

Groups|website=groups.yahoo.com|accessdate=17 July 2018}}</ref> was originally designed to augment SimRacingWorld, promoting community discussion and allowing casual players to remain aware of new developments. However, it has since expanded to contain a selection of files. Up to 1 April 2018, all new community developments were made available via this portal. However, it is clear that there was significantly more material on the SimRacingWorld website than on the group and thus it cannot be seen as a complete replacement.\n\nA new F1GP community website<ref>{{cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/view/f1gpwc|title=F1GP|website=sites.google.com|accessdate=17 July 2018}}</ref> was launched on 1 April 2018.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/f1gpwc/conversations/messages/550|title=Yahoo!

The discussion group is regularly updated with new developments.\n\nOne of the focuses of these communities has been on online multiplayer competitions. The ERace is an online multiplayer competition which uses the ''play by mail'' mode to facilitate a championship. This contest was announced on 11 October 2011<ref>{{cite web|url=https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/f1gpwc/conversations/messages/377|title=Yahoo!

Competition updates are regularly posted on the Yahoo group portal for all those interested in the game to read.\n\nIn addition to the ''play by mail'' mode, a competition using a direct [[Internet]] connection between two players has also been tested. The online gaming mode utilizes the game's built-in [[modem]] play and the serial port virtualization capabilities of the [[DOSBox]] emulator program. This method of playing ''F1GP'' over a [[LAN]] connection or over the [[Internet]] was originally tested in 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://groups.yahoo.com/neo/groups/f1gpwc/conversations/messages/250|title=Yahoo!

However, three developments in particular deserve notable mention. The construction of an [[open-source software|open-source]] game editor \"Chequered Flag\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://chequeredflag.sourceforge.net|title=Chequered Flag - An open-source attempt to create a universal F1GP/WC editor|website=chequeredflag.sourceforge.net|accessdate=17 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061206030902/http://chequeredflag.sourceforge.net/|archive-date=6 December 2006|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> is the first of these as it was a project of significant scale, designed to unify previous editing tools and introduce new game modification facilities. Initial progress was good and a number of screenshots were released on 3 September 2006 to give an indication of the editor construction state. This was followed on 23 December 2006 by the first release of the editor under version 0.1.0. This early version focused only on providing modification facilities for track editing. A more complete set of editing tools was anticipated, although this remains the only released version as of the current date.\n\n[[File:ArgEditor screenshot.png|thumb|ArgEditor screenshot]]\nThe second significant development revolves around the creation of a modern game editor \"ArgEditor\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://argtools.com/argeditor|title=ArgEditor|website=argtools.com|accessdate=17 July 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180716000147/http://argtools.com/argeditor|archive-date=16 July 2018|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref> It represents a fresh take on an F1GP editor which works on all recent versions of the [[Windows operating system]].
