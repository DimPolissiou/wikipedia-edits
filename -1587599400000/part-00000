He also read stories some nights on the BBC children's channel [[CBeebies]] as part of ''Bedtime Hour''.\n\nIn 2006, Norton hosted the BBC One series ''[[How Do You Solve a Problem like Maria?]]'' in which [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]] tried to find a lead actress for his West End version of ''[[The Sound of Music]]''.

(TV series)|When Will I Be Famous?]]'' (2007),  ''[[The One and Only (TV series)|The One and Only]]'' (2008) and ''[[Totally Saturday]]'' (2009).

It also features an \"[[agony aunt]]\" section with advice from [[Maria McErlane]] and Norton, called \"Grill Graham\".  \"Tune with a Tale\" is where a listener suggests playing a song with a plot, summarising the story it contains, and \"[[I Can't Believe It's Not Butter!|I Can't Believe It's Not Better]]\" is a feature where a listener requests a song that was previously a hit, but might be considered particularly bad now.\n\nIn January 2012, Norton asked listeners to his Radio 2 show to help find his car, shortly after it was stolen.

It remains the only Grey Cup game ever suspended during play, and the first to be finished on a Sunday. The Blue Bombers won the game by a score of 28\u201327.

However, by the second quarter, a thick fog started to roll in over the field, a combination of cold, moist, humid air from [[Lake Ontario]].  The fog was thick enough that fans could not see the action on the field, receivers lost sight of the ball after it left the quarterbacks' hand, and [[punt returner]]s could not find punts until they hit the ground.\n\nThe fog became worse as the afternoon wore on, and with 9 minutes and 29 seconds left in the fourth quarter, the game was suspended with Winnipeg leading 28\u201327. The game continued the following afternoon, but there was no further scoring, thus securing the Bomber win.\n\n==Game Summary==\n{{tone|section|date=November 2012}}\nThe 1962 championship will always be remembered for what the fans could not see. Following a year when the [[Winnipeg Blue Bombers]] and [[Hamilton Tiger-Cats]] made Canadian football history by playing in the first Grey Cup to go to overtime, the two clubs battled again in another memorable meeting. But not because of the play on the field.\n\nJust prior to halftime, fog rolled into Exhibition Stadium in Toronto, much to the chagrin of the 32,655 in attendance and the millions watching on television across North America. Although not visible to the fans, play was able to continue until the 5:31 mark of the fourth quarter. Visibility became so poor that referee Paul Dojack stopped play with Winnipeg leading 28\u201327. After a 20-minute delay, CFL commissioner Syd Halter decided that the remainder of the game would be played the following afternoon. The game will be forever known as \"The Fog Bowl\".\n\nThe Tiger-Cats drew first blood in the opening quarter when Garney Henley took advantage of some good blocking and sprinted 74 yards for a major. The convert by Don Sutherin was no good, his first of three key errors in the game. A 41-yard run by Kenny Ploen set up a Leo Lewis touchdown to begin a wild second quarter, giving Winnipeg a 7\u20136 lead. Lewis struck again when he took a handoff, ran wide and threw a 15-yard pass to Charlie Shepard in the end zone.\n\nHamilton cut the deficit to 14\u201312, first on a goal-line leap by Bobby Kuntz, then on an 18-yard touchdown run by Henley following a Winnipeg fumble. Sutherin was only good on one convert however, giving the Ticats a 19\u201314 advantage. Winnipeg regained the lead before halftime when Lewis caught a lateral pass by Funston and ran 30 yards for another major. The Blue Bombers led 21\u201319 at intermission.\n\nHamilton quarterback Joe Zuger came out throwing in the third quarter, completing a 53-yard strike to Henley, then a 36-yard touchdown throw to Dave Viti. But Shepard responded with his second major of the game, giving Winnipeg the lead for good. Gerry James added his fourth convert for good measure. The Ticats had an opportunity to regain the lead before the end of the third quarter, but Sutherin missed on a 30-yard field goal, giving Hamilton just a single point. Both teams were held pointless in the final quarter (spread over two days) as the Bombers held on to a 28\u201327 lead to win their fourth title in five years.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://cfl.ca/greycupcentral/year/1962 |title=Fog Shrouds 50th Grey Cup Game |access-date=November 25, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121015010806/http://cfl.ca/greycupcentral/year/1962 |archive-date=October 15, 2012 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n==Trivia==\n\nAfternoon fog in Toronto is a rare occurrence, but the Fog Bowl was just one of several weather disasters to occur at Exhibition Stadium. The stadium's proximity to Lake Ontario made it susceptible to rapid weather changes and extreme conditions. It remains the site of the only major league baseball game to be played with snow on the field (the [[Toronto Blue Jays]]' inaugural game on April 7, 1977), and the only major league baseball game to be suspended due to high wind. The [[70th Grey Cup|1982 Grey Cup]] (the Rain Bowl) was played in a driving rain. The limitations of Exhibition Stadium eventually led to the construction of SkyDome, now known as [[Rogers Centre]]. During its life as a professional sports stadium, local press and Torontonians often referred to Exhibition Stadium under the moniker \"Mistake by the Lake.\"\n\nThe game was the first Canadian Football League game to be broadcast by an American network, when [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[Wide World of Sports (U.S. TV series)|Wide World of Sports]]'' carried the game in the United States. It would be the only CFL game to air in the U.S. until approximately 1980, when the nascent [[ESPN]] cable network acquired U.S. broadcast rights to the league.\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe following year the CFL adopted a new rule in case play in the Grey Cup game had to be suspended.  If this occurred before the end of the third quarter, it would be resumed at the same point the next day, the same as was done in 1962.  But if the fourth quarter had begin, the CFL commissioner would choose between two options.  If he considered that one team had a big lead, he would declare the game over.  If not, the score would carry over to the following day, but instead of the play resuming at the point where it was left off, two 10-minute halves would be played, each starting with a kickoff.<ref>{{cite news|title=CFL Now Has Plan If Inclement Weather Forces Postponement|periodical=Globe and Mail|location=Toronto|date=1963-05-15|page=41}}</ref>\n\nEventually the CFL adopted a [[Canadian football#Severe weather|more complex set of rules]] for weather postponements.\n\n==See also==\n*[[2008 World Series#Game 5|Game 5 of the 2008 World Series]] - a game in which weather conditions also led to its suspension until the next day\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==Sources==\n* {{cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/fog-bowl-feature |encyclopedia=The Canadian Encyclopedia |entry=Fog Bowl |df=mdy }}\n* {{cite web|url=https://www.cfl.ca/page/his_greycup_recap1962 |title=Grey Cup: 1962 |publisher=Canadian Football League |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120813103604/http://www.cfl.ca/page/his_greycup_recap1962 |archivedate=August 13, 2012 }}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite news|url=http://cfl.ca/article/the-story-of-the-1962-grey-cup|title=The Story of the 1962 Grey Cup|last=Christie|first=Alan|date=October 11, 2008|publisher=CFL.ca|access-date=October 11, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081014051733/http://www.cfl.ca/article/the-story-of-the-1962-grey-cup|archive-date=October 14, 2008|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}\n\n{{Hamilton Tiger-Cats}}\n{{Winnipeg Blue Bombers}}\n{{50th Grey Cup}}\n{{Grey Cup}}\n{{1962 CFL season by team}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Grey Cup}}\n[[Category:Grey Cup|50]]\n[[Category:1962 in Canadian football]]\n[[Category:Winnipeg Blue Bombers]]\n[[Category:Hamilton Tiger-Cats]]\n[[Category:Grey Cups hosted in Toronto]]\n[[Category:1962 in Toronto]]\n[[Category:1962 in Canadian television]]\n[[Category:December 1962 sports events]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use Canadian English|date=September 2013}}\n{{Use mdy dates|date=November 2013}}\n{{Infobox Canadian football game\n| number         = 50\n| type           = Grey Cup\n| image          =\n| date           = December 1\u20132, 1962\n| stadium        = [[Exhibition Stadium]]\n| city           = [[Toronto]]\n| visitor name   = [[Winnipeg Blue Bombers]]|visitor colour=Winnipeg Blue Bombers\n| home name      = [[Hamilton Tiger-Cats]]|home colour=Hamilton Tiger-Cats\n| visitor coach  = [[Bud Grant]]\n| home coach     = [[Jim Trimble]]\n| visitor record = 11\u20135\n| home record    = 9\u20134\u20131\n| visitor1       = 0\n| visitor2       = 14\n| visitor3       = 7\n| visitor4       = 7\n| home1          = 6\n| home2          = 6\n| home3          = 7\n| home4          = 8\n| MVP            = [[Leo Lewis (running back)|Leo Lewis]]\n| MV2            =\n| anthem         =\n| referee        = [[Paul Dojack]]\n| coin toss      =\n| halftime       =\n| attendance     = 32,655\n| network        = [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation|CBC]], [[CTV Television Network|CTV]], [[T\u00e9l\u00e9vision de Radio-Canada|SRC]]\n| announcers     =\n| ratings        =\n}}\nThe '''50th Grey Cup''', also known as the '''Fog Bowl''', was the [[1962 CFL season|1962]] [[Grey Cup]] [[Canadian Football League]] championship game played between the [[Winnipeg Blue Bombers]] and the [[Hamilton Tiger-Cats]] on December 1, 1962, at [[Toronto]]'s [[Exhibition Stadium]].

The fog was thick enough that fans could not see the action on the field, receivers lost sight of the ball after it left the quarterbacks' hand, and [[punt returner]]s could not find punts until they hit the ground.\n\nThe fog became worse as the afternoon wore on, and with 9 minutes and 29 seconds left in the fourth quarter, the game was suspended with Winnipeg leading 28\u201327. The game continued the following afternoon, but there was no further scoring, thus securing the Bomber win.\n\n==Game Summary==\n{{tone|section|date=November 2012}}\nThe 1962 championship will always be remembered for what the fans could not see. Following a year when the [[Winnipeg Blue Bombers]] and [[Hamilton Tiger-Cats]] made Canadian football history by playing in the first Grey Cup to go to overtime, the two clubs battled again in another memorable meeting. But not because of the play on the field.\n\nJust prior to halftime, fog rolled into Exhibition Stadium in Toronto, much to the chagrin of the 32,655 in attendance and the millions watching on television across North America. Although not visible to the fans, play was able to continue until the 5:31 mark of the fourth quarter. Visibility became so poor that referee Paul Dojack stopped play with Winnipeg leading 28\u201327. After a 20-minute delay, CFL commissioner Syd Halter decided that the remainder of the game would be played the following afternoon. The game will be forever known as \"The Fog Bowl\".\n\nThe Tiger-Cats drew first blood in the opening quarter when Garney Henley took advantage of some good blocking and sprinted 74 yards for a major. The convert by Don Sutherin was no good, his first of three key errors in the game. A 41-yard run by Kenny Ploen set up a Leo Lewis touchdown to begin a wild second quarter, giving Winnipeg a 7\u20136 lead. Lewis struck again when he took a handoff, ran wide and threw a 15-yard pass to Charlie Shepard in the end zone.\n\nHamilton cut the deficit to 14\u201312, first on a goal-line leap by Bobby Kuntz, then on an 18-yard touchdown run by Henley following a Winnipeg fumble. Sutherin was only good on one convert however, giving the Ticats a 19\u201314 advantage. Winnipeg regained the lead before halftime when Lewis caught a lateral pass by Funston and ran 30 yards for another major. The Blue Bombers led 21\u201319 at intermission.\n\nHamilton quarterback Joe Zuger came out throwing in the third quarter, completing a 53-yard strike to Henley, then a 36-yard touchdown throw to Dave Viti. But Shepard responded with his second major of the game, giving Winnipeg the lead for good. Gerry James added his fourth convert for good measure. The Ticats had an opportunity to regain the lead before the end of the third quarter, but Sutherin missed on a 30-yard field goal, giving Hamilton just a single point. Both teams were held pointless in the final quarter (spread over two days) as the Bombers held on to a 28\u201327 lead to win their fourth title in five years.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://cfl.ca/greycupcentral/year/1962 |title=Fog Shrouds 50th Grey Cup Game |access-date=November 25, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121015010806/http://cfl.ca/greycupcentral/year/1962 |archive-date=October 15, 2012 |url-status=dead |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n==Trivia==\n\nAfternoon fog in Toronto is a rare occurrence, but the Fog Bowl was just one of several weather disasters to occur at Exhibition Stadium. The stadium's proximity to Lake Ontario made it susceptible to rapid weather changes and extreme conditions. It remains the site of the only major league baseball game to be played with snow on the field (the [[Toronto Blue Jays]]' inaugural game on April 7, 1977), and the only major league baseball game to be suspended due to high wind. The [[70th Grey Cup|1982 Grey Cup]] (the Rain Bowl) was played in a driving rain. The limitations of Exhibition Stadium eventually led to the construction of SkyDome, now known as [[Rogers Centre]]. During its life as a professional sports stadium, local press and Torontonians often referred to Exhibition Stadium under the moniker \"Mistake by the Lake.\"\n\nThe game was the first Canadian Football League game to be broadcast by an American network, when [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]'s ''[[Wide World of Sports (U.S. TV series)|Wide World of Sports]]'' carried the game in the United States. It would be the only CFL game to air in the U.S. until approximately 1980, when the nascent [[ESPN]] cable network acquired U.S. broadcast rights to the league.\n\n==Aftermath==\nThe following year the CFL adopted a new rule in case play in the Grey Cup game had to be suspended.  If this occurred before the end of the third quarter, it would be resumed at the same point the next day, the same as was done in 1962.  But if the fourth quarter had begin, the CFL commissioner would choose between two options.  If he considered that one team had a big lead, he would declare the game over.  If not, the score would carry over to the following day, but instead of the play resuming at the point where it was left off, two 10-minute halves would be played, each starting with a kickoff.<ref>{{cite news|title=CFL Now Has Plan If Inclement Weather Forces Postponement|periodical=Globe and Mail|location=Toronto|date=1963-05-15|page=41}}</ref>\n\nEventually the CFL adopted a [[Canadian football#Severe weather|more complex set of rules]] for weather postponements.\n\n==See also==\n*[[2008 World Series#Game 5|Game 5 of the 2008 World Series]] - a game in which weather conditions also led to its suspension until the next day\n\n==References==\n<references/>\n\n==Sources==\n* {{cite encyclopedia|url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/fog-bowl-feature |encyclopedia=The Canadian Encyclopedia |entry=Fog Bowl |df=mdy }}\n* {{cite web|url=https://www.cfl.ca/page/his_greycup_recap1962 |title=Grey Cup: 1962 |publisher=Canadian Football League |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120813103604/http://www.cfl.ca/page/his_greycup_recap1962 |archivedate=August 13, 2012 }}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite news|url=http://cfl.ca/article/the-story-of-the-1962-grey-cup|title=The Story of the 1962 Grey Cup|last=Christie|first=Alan|date=October 11, 2008|publisher=CFL.ca|access-date=October 11, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081014051733/http://www.cfl.ca/article/the-story-of-the-1962-grey-cup|archive-date=October 14, 2008|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}\n\n{{Hamilton Tiger-Cats}}\n{{Winnipeg Blue Bombers}}\n{{50th Grey Cup}}\n{{Grey Cup}}\n{{1962 CFL season by team}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Grey Cup}}\n[[Category:Grey Cup|50]]\n[[Category:1962 in Canadian football]]\n[[Category:Winnipeg Blue Bombers]]\n[[Category:Hamilton Tiger-Cats]]\n[[Category:Grey Cups hosted in Toronto]]\n[[Category:1962 in Ontario]]\n[[Category:1960s in Toronto]]\n[[Category:1962 in Canadian television]]\n[[Category:December 1962 sports events]]\n", "name_user": "KingSkyLord", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eFurther reading", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/50th_Grey_Cup"}
