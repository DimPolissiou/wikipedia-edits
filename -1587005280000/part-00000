Members are called [[Apostle (Latter Day Saints)|Apostles]], with a special calling to be [[evangelism|evangelistic]] ambassadors to the world.\n\nThe Twelve were designated to be a body of \"traveling councillors\" with jurisdiction outside areas where the church was formally organized (areas of the world outside of [[Zion (Latter Day Saints)|Zion]] or its outlying [[Stake (Latter Day Saints)|Stake]]s).

Of the five, two of them would later rejoin with [[Brigham Young]] and [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) after the 1844 schism, but they would never resume their former places in the Quorum.  Two others would join various sects (with varying degrees as to the acceptance of their apostleship) and never returned to the LDS Church, while the fifth member left the Mormon movement completely.  A sixth member of the Quorum was killed in 1838.\n\nAfter the 1844 schism, ten of the then-Quorum members followed Young to the [[Salt Lake Valley]]. Two others left and joined other sects.\n\n{| border=\"1\" class=\"wikitable\"\n! width=\"55\" |\n! width=\"150\" | Name\n! width=\"150\" | Dates ordained\n! width=\"940\" | [[Succession crisis (Latter Day Saints)|Post-succession]] crisis affiliations\n|-\n|\n| [[Thomas B.

The group normally has a leadership role in the church that is second only to the church's [[First Presidency (LDS Church)|First Presidency]]. The Quorum implicitly follows the First Presidency's policies and pronouncements and its members are chosen by the First Presidency. However, when the First Presidency is dissolved\u2014which occurs upon the death of the [[President of the Church (LDS Church)|President of the Church]]\u2014the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles becomes the church's governing body (led by the [[President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles (LDS Church)|President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles]]) until they [[ordination|ordain]] a new President of the Church and he chooses counselors, which completes the reorganization of the First Presidency.  Membership in the Quorum of the Twelve is typically a lifetime calling.\n\n[[File:First Presidency and Twelve Apostles 1898.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The [[First Presidency (LDS Church)|First Presidency]] and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles in September 1898<ref>As seen in this photograph, in September 1898 there were only 11 members of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles (shown here with the three members of the First Presidency).  Church president [[Wilford Woodruff]] had recently died and [[Lorenzo Snow]] left the Quorum to assume the presidency.  [[Rudger Clawson]] would be called the next month, in October 1898, to complete the Quorum.</ref>]]\n\n==Community of Christ==\n{{Main|Council of Twelve Apostles (Community of Christ)}}\n{{For2|the current Council of Twelve Apostles of the Community of Christ|[[Council of Twelve Apostles (Community of Christ)#Current members|Council of Twelve Apostles (current members)]]|a chronology of the Council of Twelve Apostles of the Community of Christ|[[Council of Twelve Apostles (Community of Christ)#1844 to present|Council of Twelve Apostles (chronology)]]}}\nIn the [[Community of Christ]], the Council of Twelve Apostles is one of the governing bodies in the church hierarchy. They hold the priesthood office of [[Twelve Apostles|apostle]] and are responsible for the evangelistic witness of the church. Apostles are also [[High priest (Latter Day Saints)|high priests]] in the [[Priesthood (Community of Christ)|Melchisedec priesthood]] of the church.\n\n==The Church of Jesus Christ (Bickertonite)==\n{{Main|Quorum of Twelve Apostles (Bickertonite)}}\n{{for|a chronology of and current Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of The Church of Jesus Christ|Quorum of Twelve Apostles (Bickertonite)#List of members}}\n[[The Church of Jesus Christ (Bickertonite)]] is the third largest denomination that resulted from the [[Succession crisis (Latter Day Saints)|1844 succession crisis]].\n\nAt a conference in Green Oak, Pennsylvania, in July 1862, leaders of several branches in Pennsylvania, Ohio and Virginia came together and formally organized what they called \"The Church of Jesus Christ\".  [[William Bickerton]] presided over the conference.  Bickerton's two counselors in the newly organized First Presidency were George Barnes and Charles Brown who were ordained apostles. The members of the Quorum of the Twelve at that organization (ordered by seniority) were Arthur Bickerton, Thomas Bickerton, Alexander Bickerton, James Brown, Cummings Cherry, Benjamin Meadowcroft, Joseph Astin, Joseph Knox, William Cadman, James Nichols, John Neish and John Dixon.  At the conference George Barnes reported receiving the \"word of the Lord,\" which he related:\n{{quote|Hear the word of the Lord; Ye are my Sons and Daughters, and I have committed unto you the Keys of the Kingdom, therefore be ye faithful.<ref name=\"Cadman\">{{cite book |last=Cadman |first=W.

Currently, the president of the church and his two counselors are not separated from the quorum, as the total number of apostles in the quorum is twelve, as specified in the scriptures. Apostles (and all ministers\u2014commonly called \"elders\") in this church are volunteers and are not given any compensation for their ministry.\n\n==Church of Christ (Temple Lot)==\nIn the [[Church of Christ (Temple Lot)]] the Council of Twelve serves as the head of the church. The church seeks to strictly follow the church organization of the [[Bible]] and the [[Book of Mormon]], and teaches that church offices added by [[Joseph Smith]] after publication of the [[Book of Commandments]], such as a [[President of the Church]] and a [[First Presidency]], were not consistent with the Bible and Book of Mormon, and therefore were not revelations from God {{Harv|Sheldon|1999}}.\n\n==Remnant Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints==\nThe [[Remnant Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints]] has an Apostolic Quorum that is, as yet, incomplete by design. As the Remnant Church seeks to be a \"renewal\" of the Latter Day Saint movement resulting from the 1850s Reorganization, it is attempting to follow similar patterns of that prior reorganization. The [[First Presidency]] of the Remnant Church is not drawn from the apostles. Instead, the president of the church is chosen by [[inheritance|Jewish Laws of Inheritance]].  The current members of the Quorum are: Don Burnett ([[President of the Quorum of the Twelve|President of the Quorum]]), Robert Murie Jr., Terry W. Patience, Roger Tracy, and Mark Deitrick.<ref>https://theremnantchurch.com/index.php/leadership/apostles</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n<!--See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Footnotes for an explanation of how to generate footnotes using the<ref(erences/)> tags-->\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*{{citation\n | last          = Bergera\n | first         = Gary James\n | contribution  = Church Organization and Government\n | editor1-last  = Reeve\n | editor1-first = W.

Of the five, two of them would later rejoin with [[Brigham Young]] and [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) after the 1844 schism, but they would never resume their former places in the Quorum.  Two others would join various sects (with varying degrees as to the acceptance of their apostleship) and never returned to the LDS Church, while the fifth member left the Mormon movement completely.  A sixth member of the Quorum was killed in 1838.\n\nAfter the 1844 schism, ten of the then-Quorum members followed Young to the [[Salt Lake Valley]].

The group normally has a leadership role in the church that is second only to the church's [[First Presidency (LDS Church)|First Presidency]]. The Quorum implicitly follows the First Presidency's policies and pronouncements and its members are chosen by the First Presidency. However, when the First Presidency is dissolved\u2014which occurs upon the death of the [[President of the Church (LDS Church)|President of the Church]]\u2014the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles becomes the church's governing body (led by the [[President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles (LDS Church)|President of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles]]) until they [[ordination|ordain]] a new President of the Church and he chooses counselors, which completes the reorganization of the First Presidency.  Membership in the Quorum of the Twelve is typically a lifetime calling.\n\n[[File:First Presidency and Twelve Apostles 1898.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The [[First Presidency (LDS Church)|First Presidency]] and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles in September 1898<ref>As seen in this photograph, in September 1898 there were only 11 members of the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles (shown here with the three members of the First Presidency).  Church president [[Wilford Woodruff]] had recently died and [[Lorenzo Snow]] left the Quorum to assume the presidency.  [[Rudger Clawson]] would be called the next month, in October 1898, to complete the Quorum.</ref>]]\n\n==Community of Christ==\n{{Main|Council of Twelve Apostles (Community of Christ)}}\n{{For2|the current Council of Twelve Apostles of the Community of Christ|[[Council of Twelve Apostles (Community of Christ)#Current members|Council of Twelve Apostles (current members)]]|a chronology of the Council of Twelve Apostles of the Community of Christ|[[Council of Twelve Apostles (Community of Christ)#1844 to present|Council of Twelve Apostles (chronology)]]}}\nIn the [[Community of Christ]], the Council of Twelve Apostles is one of the governing bodies in the church hierarchy. They hold the priesthood office of [[Twelve Apostles|apostle]] and are responsible for the evangelistic witness of the church. Apostles are also [[High priest (Latter Day Saints)|high priests]] in the [[Priesthood (Community of Christ)|Melchisedec priesthood]] of the church.\n\n==The Church of Jesus Christ (Bickertonite)==\n{{Main|Quorum of Twelve Apostles (Bickertonite)}}\n{{for|a chronology of and current Quorum of the Twelve Apostles of The Church of Jesus Christ|Quorum of Twelve Apostles (Bickertonite)#List of members}}\n[[The Church of Jesus Christ (Bickertonite)]] is the third largest denomination that resulted from the [[Succession crisis (Latter Day Saints)|1844 succession crisis]].\n\nAt a conference in Green Oak, Pennsylvania, in July 1862, leaders of several branches in Pennsylvania, Ohio and Virginia came together and formally organized what they called \"The Church of Jesus Christ\".  [[William Bickerton]] presided over the conference.  Bickerton's two counselors in the newly organized First Presidency were George Barnes and Charles Brown who were ordained apostles. The members of the Quorum of the Twelve at that organization (ordered by seniority) were Arthur Bickerton, Thomas Bickerton, Alexander Bickerton, James Brown, Cummings Cherry, Benjamin Meadowcroft, Joseph Astin, Joseph Knox, William Cadman, James Nichols, John Neish and John Dixon.  At the conference George Barnes reported receiving the \"word of the Lord,\" which he related:\n{{quote|Hear the word of the Lord; Ye are my Sons and Daughters, and I have committed unto you the Keys of the Kingdom, therefore be ye faithful.<ref name=\"Cadman\">{{cite book |last=Cadman |first=W. H. |authorlink=W. H.

Currently, the president of the church and his two counselors are not separated from the quorum, as the total number of apostles in the quorum is twelve, as specified in the scriptures. Apostles (and all ministers\u2014commonly called \"elders\") in this church are volunteers and are not given any compensation for their ministry.\n\n==Church of Christ (Temple Lot)==\nIn the [[Church of Christ (Temple Lot)]] the Council of Twelve serves as the head of the church. The church seeks to strictly follow the church organization of the [[Bible]] and the [[Book of Mormon]], and teaches that church offices added by [[Joseph Smith]] after publication of the [[Book of Commandments]], such as a [[President of the Church]] and a [[First Presidency]], were not consistent with the Bible and Book of Mormon, and therefore were not revelations from God {{Harv|Sheldon|1999}}.\n\n==Remnant Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints==\nThe [[Remnant Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints]] has an Apostolic Quorum that is, as yet, incomplete by design. As the Remnant Church seeks to be a \"renewal\" of the Latter Day Saint movement resulting from the 1850s Reorganization, it is attempting to follow similar patterns of that prior reorganization. The [[First Presidency]] of the Remnant Church is not drawn from the apostles. Instead, the president of the church is chosen by [[inheritance|Jewish Laws of Inheritance]].  The current members of the Quorum are: Don Burnett ([[President of the Quorum of the Twelve|President of the Quorum]]), Robert Murie Jr., Terry W. Patience, Roger Tracy, and Mark Deitrick.<ref>https://theremnantchurch.com/index.php/leadership/apostles</ref>\n\n==Notes==\n<!--See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Footnotes for an explanation of how to generate footnotes using the<ref(erences/)> tags-->\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n*{{citation\n | last          = Bergera\n | first         = Gary James\n | contribution  = Church Organization and Government\n | editor1-last  = Reeve\n | editor1-first = W.
