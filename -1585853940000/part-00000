In 1955, the former Fulton Theatre on 46th Street in New York City's Broadway [[Theater District]] was renamed the Helen Hayes Theatre. When that venue was torn down in 1982, the nearby Little Theatre was renamed in her honor.

Hayes attended [[Dominican Academy]]'s prestigious primary school, on Manhattan's Upper East Side, from 1910 to 1912, appearing there in ''The Old Dutch'', ''Little Lord Fauntleroy'', and other performances. She attended the [[Shrine of the Sacred Heart#Sacred Heart School|Academy of the Sacred Heart Convent]] in Washington and graduated in 1917.<ref>[http://biography.yourdictionary.com/helen-hayes \"Helen Hayes\"] biography.yourdictionary.com, accessed August 27, 2011</ref>\n\n==Career==\n[[File:Helen Hayes 1927.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Hayes in 1927]]\nHer sound film debut was ''[[The Sin of Madelon Claudet]]'', for which she won the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]]. She followed that with starring roles in ''[[Arrowsmith (film)|Arrowsmith]]'' (with [[Ronald Colman]]), ''[[A Farewell to Arms (1932 film)|A Farewell to Arms]]'' (with [[Gary Cooper]]), ''[[The White Sister (1933 film)|The White Sister]]'' (opposite [[Clark Gable]]), ''[[Another Language]]'' (opposite [[Robert Montgomery (actor)|Robert Montgomery]]), ''[[What Every Woman Knows (1934 film)|What Every Woman Knows]]'' (a reprise of her Broadway hit), and ''[[Vanessa: Her Love Story]]'' also with Robert Montgomery. But Hayes did not prefer film to the stage.\n\nHayes eventually returned to Broadway in 1935, where for three years she played the title role in [[Gilbert Miller]]'s production of ''[[Victoria Regina (play)|Victoria Regina]]'', with [[Vincent Price]] as Prince Albert, first at the [[Broadhurst Theatre]] and later at the [[Martin Beck Theatre]].\n\n[[File:What Every Woman Knows 1934.JPG|thumb|Hayes in the film ''What Every Woman Knows'' (1934)]]\nIn 1951, she was involved in the Broadway revival of [[J.M. Barrie]]'s play ''[[Mary Rose (play)|Mary Rose]]'' at the [[August Wilson Theatre|ANTA Playhouse]]. In 1953, she was the first-ever recipient of the [[Sarah Siddons Award]] for her work in [[Chicago theatre]], repeating as the winner in 1969. She returned to Hollywood in the 1950s, and her film star began to rise. She starred in ''[[My Son John]]'' (1952) and ''[[Anastasia (1956 film)|Anastasia]]'' (1956), and won the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]] for her role as an elderly stowaway in the [[disaster film]] ''[[Airport (1970 film)|Airport]]'' (1970). She followed that up with several roles in [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] films such as ''[[Herbie Rides Again]]'', ''[[One of Our Dinosaurs Is Missing]]'' and ''[[Candleshoe]]''. Her performance in ''Anastasia'' was considered a comeback\u2014she had suspended her career for several years due to her daughter Mary's death and her husband's failing health.\n\nIn 1955, the [[Fulton Theatre/Helen Hayes Theatre|Fulton Theatre]] was renamed for her. In the 1980s, business interests wished to raze that theatre and four others to construct a large hotel that included the [[Marquis Theatre]]. Hayes's consent to raze the theatre named for her was sought and given, though she had no ownership interest in the building. Parts of the original Helen Hayes Theatre on Broadway were used to construct [[the Shakespeare Center]] on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, which Hayes dedicated with [[Joseph Papp]] in 1982.<ref>O'Haire, Patricia. \"Dickens lends the Bard a Hand,\" ''The New York Daily News'', September 13, 1982</ref> In 1983 the Little Theater on West 45th Street was renamed the [[Helen Hayes Theatre]] in her honor, as was a theatre in Nyack, which has since been renamed the Riverspace-Arts Center. In early 2014, the site was refurbished and styled by interior designer Dawn Hershko and reopened as the Playhouse Market, a quaint restaurant and gourmet deli.\n\nHayes, who spoke with her good friend [[Anita Loos]] almost daily on the phone, told her, \"I used to think New York was the most enthralling place in the world. I'll bet it still is and if I were free next summer, I would prove it.\" With that, she convinced Loos to embark on an exploration of all five boroughs of New York. They visited and explored the city; Bellevue Hospital at night, a tugboat hauling garbage out to sea, parties, libraries, and Puerto Rican markets. They spoke to everyday people to see how they lived their lives and what made the city tick. The result of this collaborative effort was the book ''Twice Over Lightly'', published in 1972.\n\nIt is unclear when or by whom Hayes was called the \"First Lady of the Theatre\". Her friend, actress [[Katharine Cornell]], also held that title, and each thought the other deserved it.<ref name=autogenerated1>Mosel, p.unknown</ref><ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,771605,00.html \"The Theatre: Great Katharine\"].

The center protects and preserves North America's native plants and natural landscapes.<ref>[http://www.wildflower.org/about/ \"About Us, History\"] Wildflower.org, accessed August 27, 2011</ref>\n\nThe [[Helen Hayes Award]] for theater in the Washington, DC, area is named in her honor.

Some of these books' themes include her return to Roman Catholicism (she had been denied communion from the Church for the duration of her marriage to [[Charles MacArthur]], who was a [[divorce]]d Protestant); and the death of her only daughter, Mary (1930\u20131949), an aspiring actress, of [[polio]] at the age of 19. Hayes's adopted son, [[James MacArthur]] (1937\u20132010), went on to a career in acting, starring in ''[[Hawaii Five-O (1968 TV series)|Hawaii Five-O]]'' on television. Hayes guest-starred on ''Hawaii Five-O'' in the 1975 episode \"Retire in Sunny Hawaii... Forever\" and later, in 1980, both appeared in ''[[The Love Boat]]'' episode \"No Girls for Doc/Marriage of Convenience/The Caller/The Witness\".\n\nHayes was hospitalized a number of times for [[asthma]], which was aggravated by stage dust, forcing her to retire from theater in 1971, at age 71.<ref>Anderson, Ruth Nathan. \"Helen Hayes Discovers She's Allergic to Dust,\" ''Boca Raton News'', November 23, 1980</ref><ref name=\"Britannica\" />\n\nHer last Broadway show was a 1970 revival of ''[[Harvey (play)|Harvey]]'', in which she co-starred with [[James Stewart]].

Along with [[Mildred Natwick]], she became a founding member of the company's Board of Advisors in 1981.<ref>O'Haire, Patricia. \"Dickens lends the Bard a Hand,\" ''The New York Daily News'', Sept 13, 1982</ref> She was also on the board of directors for the Greater New York Council of the [[Girl Scouts of the USA]] during the early 1970s.\n\nIn 1982, Hayes dedicated Riverside's [[The Shakespeare Center]] with New York theatre producer, [[Joseph Papp]],<ref>Brochure of the Riverside Shakespeare Company, 1982, p. 3.</ref> and in 1985 she returned to the New York stage in a benefit for the company with a reading of ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'' with [[Raul Julia]], [[Len Cariou]], [[Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio]], [[Carole Shelley]], [[Celeste Holm]] and [[Harold Russell Scott, Jr.|Harold Scott]], directed by W. Stuart McDowell.<ref>Tomasson, Robert E. \"Helping Those Who Help;Scrooge's Return\", ''The New York Times'', November 24, 1985, p.78</ref> The next year Hayes performed a second benefit for the Riverside Shakespeare Company, this time at the [[Marquis Theatre]], the construction of which had been made possible by the demolition of the Helen Hayes Theatre three years before. The production featured [[Rex Smith]], [[Ossie Davis]] and [[F.

She was extremely proud of the strides the hospital made toward the rehabilitation of people with disabilities, saying: \"I've seen my name in lights on theater marquees and in letters 20 feet tall on Broadway billboards, but nothing has ever given me greater sense of pride and satisfaction than my 49-year association with this unique hospital.\"<ref name=\"rockland.lohudblogs.com\">{{Cite web|url=http://rockland.lohudblogs.com/2009/11/06/pretty-penny-to-host-helen-hayes-hospital-fundraiser/|title=Pretty Penny to host Helen Hayes Hospital fundraiser - Lohud Rockland Blog|access-date=2017-03-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170322020040/http://rockland.lohudblogs.com/2009/11/06/pretty-penny-to-host-helen-hayes-hospital-fundraiser/|archive-date=2017-03-22|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Helen Hayes MacArthur on the grounds of Helen Hayes Hospital in the 1950s.jpg|right|thumb|Helen Hayes at Helen Hayes Hospital in the 1950s.]]\nHayes became involved with the hospital in the 1940s, and was named to the Board of Visitors in 1944. In 1974, the hospital was renamed in her honor. She served on the Helen Hayes Hospital Board of Visitors for 49 years, until her death in 1993. In that time, she advocated tirelessly for the hospital, and successfully led a fight to prevent its relocation to Albany in the 1960s. In the 1970s, she was instrumental in lobbying for funding to transform the hospital into a state-of-the-art facility.\n\nHayes also contributed her enthusiastic support to hospital events and fund-raising efforts, including handing out diplomas to the children upon graduation when the hospital was still a pediatric care facility. She also faithfully attended the hospital's annual Classic Race, leading it in a classic car, handing out awards to runners, hand cyclists, and wheelchair racers, and offering the use of her home, Pretty Penny, for a dinner to launch the hospital's endowment fund.<ref name=\"rockland.lohudblogs.com\"/>\n\n==Death==\nHayes died on March 17, 1993, of [[congestive heart failure]] in [[Nyack, New York]].

In 1955, the former Fulton Theatre on 46th Street in New York City's Broadway [[Theater District]] was renamed the Helen Hayes Theatre. When that venue was torn down in 1982, the nearby Little Theatre was renamed in her honor.

She said her stage debut was as a five-year-old singer at Washington's [[Lafayette Square Opera House|Belasco Theatre]], on Lafayette Square, across from the White House.<ref>Evely, Douglas E., Dickson, Paul, and Ackerman, S.J.[https://books.google.com/books?id=y2DspYRi7G4C&pg=PA2&lpg=PA2#v=onepage&q=%22Helen%20Hayes%22 \"The White House Neighborhood\"]''On This Spot: Pinpointing the Past in Washington D.C.''

Hayes attended [[Dominican Academy]]'s prestigious primary school, on Manhattan's Upper East Side, from 1910 to 1912, appearing there in ''The Old Dutch'', ''Little Lord Fauntleroy'', and other performances. She attended the [[Shrine of the Sacred Heart#Sacred Heart School|Academy of the Sacred Heart Convent]] in Washington and graduated in 1917.<ref>[http://biography.yourdictionary.com/helen-hayes \"Helen Hayes\"] biography.yourdictionary.com, accessed August 27, 2011</ref>\n\n==Career==\n[[File:Helen Hayes 1927.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Hayes in 1927]]\nHer sound film debut was ''[[The Sin of Madelon Claudet]]'', for which she won the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]]. She followed that with starring roles in ''[[Arrowsmith (film)|Arrowsmith]]'' (with [[Ronald Colman]]), ''[[A Farewell to Arms (1932 film)|A Farewell to Arms]]'' (with [[Gary Cooper]]), ''[[The White Sister (1933 film)|The White Sister]]'' (opposite [[Clark Gable]]), ''[[Another Language]]'' (opposite [[Robert Montgomery (actor)|Robert Montgomery]]), ''[[What Every Woman Knows (1934 film)|What Every Woman Knows]]'' (a reprise of her Broadway hit), and ''[[Vanessa: Her Love Story]]'' also with Robert Montgomery. But Hayes did not prefer film to the stage.\n\nHayes eventually returned to Broadway in 1935, where for three years she played the title role in [[Gilbert Miller]]'s production of ''[[Victoria Regina (play)|Victoria Regina]]'', with [[Vincent Price]] as Prince Albert, first at the [[Broadhurst Theatre]] and later at the [[Martin Beck Theatre]].\n\n[[File:What Every Woman Knows 1934.JPG|thumb|Hayes in the film ''What Every Woman Knows'' (1934)]]\nIn 1951, she was involved in the Broadway revival of [[J.M. Barrie]]'s play ''[[Mary Rose (play)|Mary Rose]]'' at the [[August Wilson Theatre|ANTA Playhouse]]. In 1953, she was the first-ever recipient of the [[Sarah Siddons Award]] for her work in [[Chicago theatre]], repeating as the winner in 1969. She returned to Hollywood in the 1950s, and her film star began to rise. She starred in ''[[My Son John]]'' (1952) and ''[[Anastasia (1956 film)|Anastasia]]'' (1956), and won the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress]] for her role as an elderly stowaway in the [[disaster film]] ''[[Airport (1970 film)|Airport]]'' (1970). She followed that up with several roles in [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] films such as ''[[Herbie Rides Again]]'', ''[[One of Our Dinosaurs Is Missing]]'' and ''[[Candleshoe]]''. Her performance in ''Anastasia'' was considered a comeback\u2014she had suspended her career for several years due to her daughter Mary's death and her husband's failing health.\n\nIn 1955, the [[Fulton Theatre/Helen Hayes Theatre|Fulton Theatre]] was renamed for her. In the 1980s, business interests wished to raze that theatre and four others to construct a large hotel that included the [[Marquis Theatre]]. Hayes's consent to raze the theatre named for her was sought and given, though she had no ownership interest in the building. Parts of the original Helen Hayes Theatre on Broadway were used to construct [[the Shakespeare Center]] on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, which Hayes dedicated with [[Joseph Papp]] in 1982.<ref>O'Haire, Patricia. \"Dickens lends the Bard a Hand,\" ''The New York Daily News'', September 13, 1982</ref> In 1983 the Little Theater on West 45th Street was renamed the [[Helen Hayes Theatre]] in her honor, as was a theatre in Nyack, which has since been renamed the Riverspace-Arts Center. In early 2014, the site was refurbished and styled by interior designer Dawn Hershko and reopened as the Playhouse Market, a quaint restaurant and gourmet deli.\n\nHayes, who spoke with her good friend [[Anita Loos]] almost daily on the phone, told her, \"I used to think New York was the most enthralling place in the world. I'll bet it still is and if I were free next summer, I would prove it.\" With that, she convinced Loos to embark on an exploration of all five boroughs of New York. They visited and explored the city; Bellevue Hospital at night, a tugboat hauling garbage out to sea, parties, libraries, and Puerto Rican markets. They spoke to everyday people to see how they lived their lives and what made the city tick. The result of this collaborative effort was the book ''Twice Over Lightly'', published in 1972.\n\nIt is unclear when or by whom Hayes was called the \"First Lady of the Theatre\". Her friend, actress [[Katharine Cornell]], also held that title, and each thought the other deserved it.<ref name=autogenerated1>Mosel, p.unknown</ref><ref>[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,771605,00.html \"The Theatre: Great Katharine\"].

The center protects and preserves North America's native plants and natural landscapes.<ref>[http://www.wildflower.org/about/ \"About Us, History\"] Wildflower.org, accessed August 27, 2011</ref>\n\nThe [[Helen Hayes Award]] for theater in the Washington, DC, area is named in her honor.

Some of these books' themes include her return to Roman Catholicism (she had been denied communion from the Church for the duration of her marriage to [[Charles MacArthur]], who was a [[divorce]]d Protestant); and the death of her only daughter, Mary (1930\u20131949), an aspiring actress, of [[polio]] at the age of 19. Hayes's adopted son, [[James MacArthur]] (1937\u20132010), went on to a career in acting, starring in ''[[Hawaii Five-O (1968 TV series)|Hawaii Five-O]]'' on television. Hayes guest-starred on ''Hawaii Five-O'' in the 1975 episode \"Retire in Sunny Hawaii... Forever\" and later, in 1980, both appeared in ''[[The Love Boat]]'' episode \"No Girls for Doc/Marriage of Convenience/The Caller/The Witness\".\n\nHayes was hospitalized a number of times for [[asthma]], which was aggravated by stage dust, forcing her to retire from theater in 1971, at age 71.<ref>Anderson, Ruth Nathan. \"Helen Hayes Discovers She's Allergic to Dust,\" ''Boca Raton News'', November 23, 1980</ref><ref name=\"Britannica\" />\n\nHer last Broadway show was a 1970 revival of ''[[Harvey (play)|Harvey]]'', in which she co-starred with [[James Stewart]].

She is one of those actors ... where to watch how she is doing something is almost as pleasurable as what she is doing.\"<ref>Barnes, Clive. \"Stage:Unseen White Rabbit Returns:James Stewart Stars in Phoenix's 'Harvey'\", ''The New York Times'', February 25, 1970, p.41</ref> She spent most of her last years writing and raising money for organizations that fight asthma.\n\n==Philanthropy==\n[[File:SHAKESPEARE CENTER DEDICATION HELEN HAYES 4 small.jpg|thumb|upright|Riverside Shakespeare Company Shakespeare Center Dedication with Helen Hayes, 1982.]]\nHayes was a generous donor of time and money to a number of causes and organizations, including the [[Riverside Shakespeare Company]] of New York City. Along with [[Mildred Natwick]], she became a founding member of the company's Board of Advisors in 1981.<ref>O'Haire, Patricia. \"Dickens lends the Bard a Hand,\" ''The New York Daily News'', Sept 13, 1982</ref> She was also on the board of directors for the Greater New York Council of the [[Girl Scouts of the USA]] during the early 1970s.\n\nIn 1982, Hayes dedicated Riverside's [[The Shakespeare Center]] with New York theatre producer, [[Joseph Papp]],<ref>Brochure of the Riverside Shakespeare Company, 1982, p. 3.</ref> and in 1985 she returned to the New York stage in a benefit for the company with a reading of ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'' with [[Raul Julia]], [[Len Cariou]], [[Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio]], [[Carole Shelley]], [[Celeste Holm]] and [[Harold Russell Scott, Jr.|Harold Scott]], directed by W. Stuart McDowell.<ref>Tomasson, Robert E. \"Helping Those Who Help;Scrooge's Return\", ''The New York Times'', November 24, 1985, p.78</ref> The next year Hayes performed a second benefit for the Riverside Shakespeare Company, this time at the [[Marquis Theatre]], the construction of which had been made possible by the demolition of the Helen Hayes Theatre three years before. The production featured [[Rex Smith]], [[Ossie Davis]] and [[F. Murray Abraham]], and was produced by McDowell and directed by Robert Small, with Hayes narrating.\n\n==Helen Hayes Hospital==\n[[File:Helen Hayes and young patient at Helen Hayes Hospital 1945.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Helen Hayes and a young patient at Helen Hayes Hospital 1945]]\n\nAccording to her daughter-in-law, HB MacArthur, Hayes took the most pride in her philanthropic work with [[Helen Hayes Hospital]], a physical rehabilitation hospital located in [[West Haverstraw]], New York. She was extremely proud of the strides the hospital made toward the rehabilitation of people with disabilities, saying: \"I've seen my name in lights on theater marquees and in letters 20 feet tall on Broadway billboards, but nothing has ever given me greater sense of pride and satisfaction than my 49-year association with this unique hospital.\"<ref name=\"rockland.lohudblogs.com\">{{Cite web|url=http://rockland.lohudblogs.com/2009/11/06/pretty-penny-to-host-helen-hayes-hospital-fundraiser/|title=Pretty Penny to host Helen Hayes Hospital fundraiser - Lohud Rockland Blog|access-date=2017-03-21|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170322020040/http://rockland.lohudblogs.com/2009/11/06/pretty-penny-to-host-helen-hayes-hospital-fundraiser/|archive-date=2017-03-22|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Helen Hayes MacArthur on the grounds of Helen Hayes Hospital in the 1950s.jpg|right|thumb|Helen Hayes at Helen Hayes Hospital in the 1950s.]]\nHayes became involved with the hospital in the 1940s, and was named to the Board of Visitors in 1944. In 1974, the hospital was renamed in her honor. She served on the Helen Hayes Hospital Board of Visitors for 49 years, until her death in 1993. In that time, she advocated tirelessly for the hospital, and successfully led a fight to prevent its relocation to Albany in the 1960s. In the 1970s, she was instrumental in lobbying for funding to transform the hospital into a state-of-the-art facility.\n\nHayes also contributed her enthusiastic support to hospital events and fund-raising efforts, including handing out diplomas to the children upon graduation when the hospital was still a pediatric care facility. She also faithfully attended the hospital's annual Classic Race, leading it in a classic car, handing out awards to runners, hand cyclists, and wheelchair racers, and offering the use of her home, Pretty Penny, for a dinner to launch the hospital's endowment fund.<ref name=\"rockland.lohudblogs.com\"/>\n\n==Death==\nHayes died on March 17, 1993, of [[congestive heart failure]] in [[Nyack, New York]]. Hayes's friend [[Lillian Gish]], the \"First Lady of American Cinema\", was the designated beneficiary of her estate, but Gish had died less than a month earlier.

The first step toward a theory of Solar System formation and evolution was the general acceptance of [[heliocentrism]], which placed the Sun at the centre of the system and the [[Earth]] in orbit around it. This concept had developed for millennia ([[Aristarchus of Samos]] had suggested it as early as 250 BC), but was not widely accepted until the end of the 17th century.

After 500\u2013600&nbsp;million years (about 4&nbsp;billion years ago) Jupiter and Saturn fell into a 2:1 resonance: Saturn orbited the Sun once for every two Jupiter orbits.<ref name=\"Levison2007\" /> This resonance created a gravitational push against the outer planets, possibly causing Neptune to surge past Uranus and plough into the ancient Kuiper belt.<ref name=\"Tsiganis05\" />\nThe planets scattered the majority of the small icy bodies inwards, while themselves moving outwards. These planetesimals then scattered off the next planet they encountered in a similar manner, moving the planets' orbits outwards while they moved inwards.<ref name=\"Levison2007\" /> This process continued until the planetesimals interacted with Jupiter, whose immense gravity sent them into highly elliptical orbits or even ejected them outright from the Solar System. This caused Jupiter to move slightly inward.<ref group=lower-alpha>The reason that Saturn, Uranus and Neptune all moved outward whereas Jupiter moved inward is that Jupiter is massive enough to eject planetesimals from the Solar System, while the other three outer planets are not. To eject an object from the Solar System, Jupiter transfers energy to it, and so loses some of its own orbital energy and moves inwards. When Neptune, Uranus and Saturn perturb planetesimals outwards, those planetesimals end up in highly eccentric but still bound orbits, and so can return to the perturbing planet and possibly return its lost energy. On the other hand, when Neptune, Uranus and Saturn perturb objects inwards, those planets gain energy by doing so and therefore move outwards. More importantly, an object being perturbed inwards stands a greater chance of encountering Jupiter and being [[Interstellar comet|ejected]] from the Solar System, in which case the energy gains of Neptune, Uranus and Saturn obtained from their inwards deflections of the ejected object become permanent.</ref> Those objects scattered by Jupiter into highly elliptical orbits formed the Oort cloud;<ref name=\"Levison2007\" /> those objects scattered to a lesser degree by the migrating Neptune formed the current Kuiper belt and scattered disc.<ref name=\"Levison2007\" /> This scenario explains the Kuiper belt's and scattered disc's present low mass.

A moon will raise a [[tidal bulge]] in the object it orbits (the primary) due to the differential gravitational force across diameter of the primary. If a moon is revolving in the same direction as the planet's rotation and the planet is rotating faster than the orbital period of the moon, the bulge will constantly be pulled ahead of the moon. In this situation, [[angular momentum]] is transferred from the rotation of the primary to the revolution of the satellite. The moon gains energy and gradually spirals outward, while the primary rotates more slowly over time.\n\nThe Earth and its Moon are one example of this configuration. Today, the Moon is [[tidally locked]] to the Earth; one of its revolutions around the Earth (currently about 29 days) is equal to one of its rotations about its axis, so it always shows one face to the Earth. The Moon will continue to recede from Earth, and Earth's spin will continue to slow gradually.

In these cases, the tidal bulge lags behind the moon in its orbit. In the former case, the direction of angular momentum transfer is reversed, so the rotation of the primary speeds up while the satellite's orbit shrinks. In the latter case, the angular momentum of the rotation and revolution have opposite signs, so transfer leads to decreases in the magnitude of each (that cancel each other out).<ref group=lower-alpha>In all of these cases of transfer of angular momentum and energy, the angular momentum of the two-body system is conserved. In contrast, the summed energy of the moon's revolution plus the primary's rotation is not conserved, but decreases over time, due to dissipation via frictional heat generated by the movement of the tidal bulge through the body of the primary. If the primary were a frictionless ideal fluid, the tidal bulge would be centered under the satellite, and no transfer would take place. It is the loss of dynamical energy through friction that makes transfer of angular momentum possible.</ref> In both cases, [[Tidal acceleration#Tidal deceleration|tidal deceleration]] causes the moon to spiral in towards the primary until it either is torn apart by tidal stresses, potentially creating a [[planetary ring]] system, or crashes into the planet's surface or atmosphere.

Since the dawn of the [[space age]] in the 1950s and the discovery of [[extrasolar planets]] in the 1990s, the model has been both challenged and refined to account for new observations.\n\nThe Solar System has evolved considerably since its initial formation. Many moons have formed from circling discs of gas and dust around their parent planets, while other moons are thought to have formed independently and later been captured by their planets. Still others, such as Earth's [[Moon]], may be the result of [[giant impact hypothesis|giant collisions]]. Collisions between bodies have occurred continually up to the present day and have been central to the evolution of the Solar System. The positions of the planets might have shifted due to gravitational interactions.<ref name=\"Gomes\" /> This [[planetary migration]] is now thought to have been responsible for much of the Solar System's early evolution.\n\nIn roughly 5&nbsp;billion years, the Sun will cool and expand outward to many times its current diameter (becoming a [[red giant]]), before casting off its outer layers as a [[planetary nebula]] and leaving behind a stellar remnant known as a [[white dwarf]]. In the far distant future, the gravity of passing stars will gradually reduce the Sun's retinue of planets. Some planets will be destroyed, others ejected into [[interstellar space]].

The first step toward a theory of Solar System formation and evolution was the general acceptance of [[heliocentrism]], which placed the Sun at the centre of the system and the [[Earth]] in orbit around it. This concept had developed for millennia ([[Aristarchus of Samos]] had suggested it as early as 250 BC), but was not widely accepted until the end of the 17th century.

After 500\u2013600&nbsp;million years (about 4&nbsp;billion years ago) Jupiter and Saturn fell into a 2:1 resonance: Saturn orbited the Sun once for every two Jupiter orbits.<ref name=\"Levison2007\" /> This resonance created a gravitational push against the outer planets, possibly causing Neptune to surge past Uranus and plough into the ancient Kuiper belt.<ref name=\"Tsiganis05\" />\nThe planets scattered the majority of the small icy bodies inwards, while themselves moving outwards. These planetesimals then scattered off the next planet they encountered in a similar manner, moving the planets' orbits outwards while they moved inwards.<ref name=\"Levison2007\" /> This process continued until the planetesimals interacted with Jupiter, whose immense gravity sent them into highly elliptical orbits or even ejected them outright from the Solar System. This caused Jupiter to move slightly inward.<ref group=lower-alpha>The reason that Saturn, Uranus and Neptune all moved outward whereas Jupiter moved inward is that Jupiter is massive enough to eject planetesimals from the Solar System, while the other three outer planets are not. To eject an object from the Solar System, Jupiter transfers energy to it, and so loses some of its own orbital energy and moves inwards. When Neptune, Uranus and Saturn perturb planetesimals outwards, those planetesimals end up in highly eccentric but still bound orbits, and so can return to the perturbing planet and possibly return its lost energy. On the other hand, when Neptune, Uranus and Saturn perturb objects inwards, those planets gain energy by doing so and therefore move outwards. More importantly, an object being perturbed inwards stands a greater chance of encountering Jupiter and being [[Interstellar comet|ejected]] from the Solar System, in which case the energy gains of Neptune, Uranus and Saturn obtained from their inwards deflections of the ejected object become permanent.</ref> Those objects scattered by Jupiter into highly elliptical orbits formed the Oort cloud;<ref name=\"Levison2007\" /> those objects scattered to a lesser degree by the migrating Neptune formed the current Kuiper belt and scattered disc.<ref name=\"Levison2007\" /> This scenario explains the Kuiper belt's and scattered disc's present low mass.

After Saturn formed, migrated inward, and established the 2:3 mean motion resonance with Jupiter, the study assumes that both planets migrated back to their present positions.

A moon will raise a [[tidal bulge]] in the object it orbits (the primary) due to the differential gravitational force across diameter of the primary. If a moon is revolving in the same direction as the planet's rotation and the planet is rotating faster than the orbital period of the moon, the bulge will constantly be pulled ahead of the moon. In this situation, [[angular momentum]] is transferred from the rotation of the primary to the revolution of the satellite. The moon gains energy and gradually spirals outward, while the primary rotates more slowly over time.\n\nThe Earth and its Moon are one example of this configuration. Today, the Moon is [[tidally locked]] to the Earth; one of its revolutions around the Earth (currently about 29 days) is equal to one of its rotations about its axis, so it always shows one face to the Earth. The Moon will continue to recede from Earth, and Earth's spin will continue to slow gradually.

In these cases, the tidal bulge lags behind the moon in its orbit. In the former case, the direction of angular momentum transfer is reversed, so the rotation of the primary speeds up while the satellite's orbit shrinks. In the latter case, the angular momentum of the rotation and revolution have opposite signs, so transfer leads to decreases in the magnitude of each (that cancel each other out).<ref group=lower-alpha>In all of these cases of transfer of angular momentum and energy, the angular momentum of the two-body system is conserved. In contrast, the summed energy of the moon's revolution plus the primary's rotation is not conserved, but decreases over time, due to dissipation via frictional heat generated by the movement of the tidal bulge through the body of the primary. If the primary were a frictionless ideal fluid, the tidal bulge would be centered under the satellite, and no transfer would take place. It is the loss of dynamical energy through friction that makes transfer of angular momentum possible.</ref> In both cases, [[Tidal acceleration#Tidal deceleration|tidal deceleration]] causes the moon to spiral in towards the primary until it either is torn apart by tidal stresses, potentially creating a [[planetary ring]] system, or crashes into the planet's surface or atmosphere.

{"title_page": "Formal power series", "text_new": "{{Refimprove|date=December 2009}}\nIn [[mathematics]], a '''formal power series''' is a generalization of a [[polynomial]], where the number of terms is allowed to be infinite; this implies giving up the possibility of replacing the variable in the polynomial with an arbitrary number. Thus a formal power series differs from a polynomial in that it may have infinitely many terms, and differs from a [[power series]], whose variables can take on numerical values. One way to view a formal power series is as an infinite ordered sequence of numbers. In this case, the powers of the variable are used only to indicate the order of the coefficients, so that the coefficient of <math>x^5</math> is the fifth term in the sequence. In [[combinatorics]], formal power series provide representations of numerical [[sequence]]s and of [[multiset]]s, and for instance allow concise expressions for [[recursion|recursively]] defined sequences regardless of whether the recursion can be explicitly solved; this is known as the method of [[generating function]]s. More generally, formal power series can include series with any finite number of variables, and with coefficients in an arbitrary [[ring (mathematics)|ring]]. Formal power series can be created from [[Taylor polynomial|Taylor polynomials]] using [[formal moduli]].\n\n==Introduction==\nA formal power series can be loosely thought of as an object that is like a [[polynomial]], but with infinitely many terms. Alternatively, for those familiar with [[power series]] (or [[Taylor series]]), one may think of a formal power series as a power series in which we ignore questions of [[Convergent series|convergence]] by not assuming that the variable ''X'' denotes any numerical value (not even an unknown value). For example, consider the series\n\n:<math>A = 1 - 3X + 5X^2 - 7X^3 + 9X^4 - 11X^5 + \\cdots.</math>\n\nIf we studied this as a power series, its properties would include, for example, that its [[radius of convergence]] is 1. However, as a formal power series, we may ignore this completely; all that is relevant is the sequence of [[coefficient]]s [1, \u22123, 5, \u22127, 9, \u221211, ...]. In other words, a formal power series is an object that just records a sequence of coefficients. It is perfectly acceptable to consider a formal power series with the [[factorial]]s [1, 1, 2, 6, 24, 120, 720, 5040, ... ] as coefficients, even though the corresponding power series diverges for any nonzero value of ''X''.\n\nArithmetic on formal power series is carried out by simply pretending that the series are polynomials. For example, if\n\n:<math>B = 2X + 4X^3 + 6X^5 + \\cdots,</math>\n\nthen we add ''A'' and ''B'' term by term:\n\n:<math>A + B = 1 - X + 5X^2 - 3X^3 + 9X^4 - 5X^5 + \\cdots.</math>\n\nWe can multiply formal power series, again just by treating them as polynomials (see in particular [[Cauchy product]]):\n\n:<math>AB = 2X - 6X^2 + 14X^3 - 26X^4 + 44X^5 + \\cdots.</math>\n\nNotice that each coefficient in the product ''AB'' only depends on a ''finite'' number of coefficients of ''A'' and ''B''. For example, the ''X''<sup>5</sup> term is given by\n\n:<math>44X^5 = (1\\times 6X^5) + (5X^2 \\times 4X^3) + (9X^4 \\times 2X).</math>\n\nFor this reason, one may multiply formal power series without worrying about the usual questions of [[absolute convergence|absolute]], [[conditional convergence|conditional]] and [[uniform convergence]] which arise in dealing with power series in the setting of [[Mathematical analysis|analysis]].\n\nOnce we have defined multiplication for formal power series, we can define multiplicative inverses as follows. The multiplicative inverse of a formal power series ''A'' is a formal power series ''C'' such that ''AC'' = 1, provided that such a formal power series exists. It turns out that if ''A'' has a multiplicative inverse, it is unique, and we denote it by ''A''<sup>\u22121</sup>. Now we can define division of formal power series by defining ''B''/''A'' to be the product ''BA''<sup>\u22121</sup>, provided that the inverse of ''A'' exists. For example, one can use the definition of multiplication above to verify the familiar formula\n\n:<math>\\frac{1}{1 + X} = 1 - X + X^2 - X^3 + X^4 - X^5 + \\cdots.</math>\n\nAn important operation on formal power series is coefficient extraction. In its most basic form, the coefficient extraction operator <math>[X^n]</math> applied to a formal power series <math>A</math> in one variable extracts the coefficient of the <math>n</math>th power of the variable, so that <math>[X^2]A=5</math> and <math>[X^5]A=-11</math>. Other examples include\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\left[X^3\\right] (B) &= 4, \\\\ \n\\left[X^2 \\right] (X + 3 X^2 Y^3 + 10 Y^6) &= 3Y^3, \\\\\n\\left[X^2Y^3 \\right] ( X + 3 X^2 Y^3 + 10 Y^6) &= 3, \\\\\n\\left[X^n \\right] \\left(\\frac{1}{1+X} \\right) &= (-1)^n, \\\\ \n\\left[X^n \\right] \\left(\\frac{X}{(1-X)^2} \\right) &= n.\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nSimilarly, many other operations that are carried out on polynomials can be extended to the formal power series setting, as explained below.\n\n==The ring of formal power series==\n{{Ring theory sidebar}}\n\nIf one considers the set of all formal power series in ''X'' with coefficients in a [[commutative ring]] ''R'', the elements of this set collectively constitute another ring which is written <math>R[[X]],</math> and called the '''ring of formal power series''' in the variable&nbsp;''X'' over ''R''.\n\n===Definition of the formal power series ring===\nOne can characterize <math>R[[X]]</math> abstractly as the [[completeness (topology)|completion]] of the [[polynomial]] ring <math>R[X]</math> equipped with a particular [[metric space|metric]]<!-- in which the powers of the ideal ''I'' of <math>R[X]</math> generated by <math>X</math> form a shrinking set of neighbourhoods of 0; a precise description would be too long to spell out here-->. This automatically gives <math>R[[X]]</math> the structure of a [[topological ring]] (and even of a complete metric space). But the general construction of a completion of a metric space is more involved than what is needed here, and would make formal power series seem more complicated than they are. \nIt is possible to describe <math>R[[X]]</math> more explicitly, and define the ring structure and topological structure separately, as follows.\n\n====Ring structure====\nAs a set, <math>R[[X]]</math> can be constructed as the set <math>R^\\N</math> of all infinite sequences of elements of <math>R</math>, indexed by the [[natural number]]s (taken to include 0). Designating a sequence whose term at index <math>n</math> is <math>a_n</math> by <math>(a_n)</math>, one defines addition of two such sequences by\n\n:<math>(a_n)_{n\\in\\N} + (b_n)_{n\\in\\N} = \\left( a_n + b_n \\right)_{n\\in\\N}</math>\n\nand multiplication by\n\n:<math>(a_n)_{n\\in\\N} \\times (b_n)_{n\\in\\N} = \\left( \\sum_{k=0}^n a_k b_{n-k} \\right)_{n\\in\\N}.</math>\n\nThis type of product is called the [[Cauchy product]] of the two sequences of coefficients, and is a sort of discrete [[convolution]]. With these operations, <math>R^\\N</math> becomes a commutative ring with zero element <math>(0,0,0,\\ldots)</math> and multiplicative identity <math>(1,0,0,\\ldots)</math>.\n\nThe product is in fact the same one used to define the product of polynomials in one indeterminate, which suggests using a similar notation. One embeds <math>R</math> into <math>R[[X]]</math> by sending any (constant) <math>a \\in R</math> to the sequence <math>(a,0,0,\\ldots)</math> and designates the sequence <math>(0,1,0,0,\\ldots)</math> by <math>X</math>; then using the above definitions every sequence with only finitely many nonzero terms can be expressed in terms of these special elements as\n\n:<math>(a_0, a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n, 0, 0, \\ldots) = a_0 + a_1 X + \\cdots + a_n X^n = \\sum_{i=0}^n a_i X^i;</math>\n\nthese are precisely the polynomials in <math>X</math>. Given this, it is quite natural and convenient to designate a general sequence <math>(a_n)_{n\\in\\N}</math> by the formal expression <math>\\textstyle\\sum_{i\\in\\N}a_i X^i</math>, even though the latter ''is not'' an expression formed by the operations of addition and multiplication defined above (from which only finite sums can be constructed). This notational convention allows reformulation of the above definitions as\n\n:<math>\\left(\\sum_{i\\in\\N} a_i X^i\\right)+\\left(\\sum_{i\\in\\N} b_i X^i\\right) = \\sum_{i\\in\\N}(a_i+b_i) X^i</math>\n\nand\n\n:<math>\\left(\\sum_{i\\in\\N} a_i X^i\\right) \\times \\left(\\sum_{i\\in\\N} b_i X^i\\right) = \\sum_{n\\in\\N} \\left(\\sum_{k=0}^n a_k b_{n-k}\\right) X^n.</math>\n\nwhich is quite convenient, but one must be aware of the distinction between formal summation (a mere convention) and actual addition.\n\n==== Topological structure ====\nHaving stipulated conventionally that\n\n:<math>(a_0, a_1, a_2, a_3, \\ldots) = \\sum_{i=0}^\\infty a_i X^i, \\qquad (1)</math>\n\none would like to interpret the right hand side as a well-defined infinite summation. To that end, a notion of convergence in <math>R^\\N</math> is defined and a [[topology]] on <math>R^\\N</math> is constructed. There are several equivalent ways to define the desired topology.\n\n* We may give <math>R^\\N</math> the [[product topology]], where each copy of <math>R</math> is given the [[discrete topology]].\n\n* We may give <math>R^\\N</math> the [[I-adic topology]], where <math>I=(X)</math> is the ideal generated by <math>X</math>, which consists of all sequences whose first term <math>a_0</math> is zero.\n\n* The desired topology could also be derived from the following [[metric space|metric]]. The distance between distinct sequences <math>(a_n), (b_n) \\in R^{\\N},</math> is defined to be\n::<math>d((a_n), (b_n)) = 2^{-k},</math>\n:where <math>k</math> is the smallest [[natural number]] such that <math>a_k\\neq b_k</math>; the distance between two equal sequences is of course zero.\n\nInformally, two sequences <math>\\{a_n\\}</math> and <math>\\{b_n\\}</math> become closer and closer if and only if more and more of their terms agree exactly. Formally, the sequence of [[partial sum]]s of some infinite summation converges if for every fixed power of <math>X</math> the coefficient stabilizes: there is a point beyond which all further partial sums have the same coefficient. This is clearly the case for the right hand side of (1), regardless of the values <math>a_n</math>, since inclusion of the term for <math>i=n</math> gives the last (and in fact only) change to the coefficient of <math>X^n</math>. It is also obvious that the [[limit of a sequence|limit]] of the sequence of partial sums is equal to the left hand side.\n\nThis topological structure, together with the ring operations described above, form a topological ring. This is called the '''ring of formal power series over <math>R</math>''' and is denoted by <math>R[[X]]</math>. The topology has the useful property that an infinite summation converges if and only if the sequence of its terms converges to 0, which just means that any fixed power of <math>X</math> occurs in only finitely many terms.\n\nThe topological structure allows much more flexible usage of infinite summations. For instance the rule for multiplication can be restated simply as\n\n:<math>\\left(\\sum_{i\\in\\N} a_i X^i\\right) \\times \\left(\\sum_{i\\in\\N} b_i X^i\\right) = \\sum_{i,j\\in\\N} a_i b_j X^{i+j},</math>\n\nsince only finitely many terms on the right affect any fixed <math>X^n</math>. Infinite products are also defined by the topological structure; it can be seen that an infinite product converges if and only if the sequence of its factors converges to 1.\n\n==== Alternative topologies ====\nThe above topology is the [[Comparison of topologies|finest topology]] for which \n\n:<math>\\sum_{i=0}^\\infty a_i X^i</math> \n\nalways converges as a summation to the formal power series designated by the same expression, and it often suffices to give a meaning to infinite sums and products, or other kinds of limits that one wishes to use to designate particular formal power series. It can however happen occasionally that one wishes to use a coarser topology, so that certain expressions become convergent that would otherwise diverge. This applies in particular when the base ring <math>R</math> already comes with a topology other than the discrete one, for instance if it is also a ring of formal power series.\n\nConsider the ring of formal power series: <math>\\Z[[X]][[Y]]</math>; then the topology of above construction only relates to the indeterminate <math>Y</math>, since the topology that was put on <math>\\Z[[X]]</math> has been replaced by the discrete topology when defining the topology of the whole ring. So\n\n:<math>\\sum_{i\\in\\N}XY^i</math>\n\nconverges to the power series suggested, which can be written as <math>\\tfrac{X}{1-Y}</math>; however the summation\n\n:<math>\\sum_{i\\in\\N}X^iY</math>\n\nwould be considered to be divergent, since every term affects the coefficient of <math>Y</math> (which coefficient is itself a power series in <math>X</math>). This asymmetry disappears if the power series ring in <math>Y</math> is given the product topology where each copy of <math>\\Z[[X]]</math> is given its topology as a ring of formal power series rather than the discrete topology. As a consequence, for convergence of a sequence of elements of <math>\\Z[[X]][[Y]]</math> it then suffices that the coefficient of each power of <math>Y</math> converges to a formal power series in <math>X</math>, a weaker condition than stabilizing entirely; for instance in the second example given here the coefficient of <math>Y</math>converges to <math>\\tfrac{1}{1-X}</math>, so the whole summation converges to <math>\\tfrac{Y}{1-X}</math>.\n\nThis way of defining the topology is in fact the standard one for repeated constructions of rings of formal power series, and gives the same topology as one would get by taking formal power series in all indeterminates at once. In the above example that would mean constructing <math>\\Z[[X,Y]],</math> and here a sequence converges if and only if the coefficient of every monomial <math>X^iY^j</math> stabilizes. This topology, which is also the <math>I</math>-adic topology, where <math>I=(X,Y)</math> is the ideal generated by <math>X</math> and <math>Y</math>, still enjoys the property that a summation converges if and only if its terms tend to 0.\n\nThe same principle could be used to make other divergent limits converge. For instance in <math>\\R[[X]]</math> the limit\n\n:<math>\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\left(1+\\frac{X}{n}\\right)^n</math>\n\ndoes not exist, so in particular it does not converge to \n\n:<math>\\exp(X)=\\sum_{n\\in\\N}\\frac{X^n}{n!}.</math>\n\nThis is because for <math>i\\geq 2</math> the coefficient <math>\\tbinom{n}{i}/n^i</math> of <math>X^i</math> does not stabilize as <math>n\\to \\infty</math>. It does however converge in the usual topology of <math>\\R</math>, and in fact to the coefficient <math>\\tfrac{1}{i!}</math> of <math>\\exp(X)</math>. Therefore, if one would give <math>\\R[[X]]</math> the product topology of <math>\\R^\\N</math> where the topology of <math>\\R</math> is the usual topology rather than the discrete one, then the above limit would converge to <math>\\exp(X)</math>. This more permissive approach is not however the standard when considering formal power series, as it would lead to convergence considerations that are as subtle as they are in [[analysis (mathematics)|analysis]], while the philosophy of formal power series is on the contrary to make convergence questions as trivial as they can possibly be. With this topology it would ''not'' be the case that a summation converges if and only if its terms tend to 0.\n\n===Universal property===\nThe ring <math>R[[X]]</math> may be characterized by the following [[universal property]]. If <math>S</math> is a commutative associative algebra over <math>R</math>, if <math>I</math> is an ideal of <math>S</math> such that the <math>I</math>-adic topology on <math>S</math> is complete, and if <math>x</math> is an element of <math>I</math>, then there is a ''unique'' <math>\\Phi: R[[X]]\\to S</math> with the following properties:\n\n* <math>\\Phi</math> is an <math>R</math>-algebra homomorphism\n\n* <math>\\Phi</math> is continuous\n\n* <math>\\Phi(X)=x</math>.\n\n== Operations on formal power series ==\nOne can perform algebraic operations on power series to generate new power series.<ref name=\"Zwillinger_2014\">{{cite book |author-first1=Izrail Solomonovich |author-last1=Gradshteyn |author-link1=Izrail Solomonovich Gradshteyn |author-first2=Iosif Moiseevich |author-last2=Ryzhik |author-link2=Iosif Moiseevich Ryzhik |author-first3=Yuri Veniaminovich |author-last3=Geronimus |author-link3 =Yuri Veniaminovich Geronimus |author-first4=Michail Yulyevich |author-last4=Tseytlin |author-link4=Michail Yulyevich Tseytlin |author-first5=Alan |author-last5=Jeffrey |editor1-first=Daniel |editor1-last=Zwillinger |editor2-first=Victor Hugo |editor2-last=Moll |translator=Scripta Technica, Inc. |title=Table of Integrals, Series, and Products |publisher=[[Academic Press, Inc.]] |date=2015 |orig-year=October 2014 |edition=8 |language=English |isbn=978-0-12-384933-5 |lccn=2014010276 <!-- |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NjnLAwAAQBAJ |access-date=2016-02-21-->|titlelink=Gradshteyn and Ryzhik |chapter=0.313 |page=18}} (Several previous editions as well.)</ref><ref name=formalpowerseries>{{cite journal | first=Ivan | last=Niven | authorlink=Ivan Niven | title=Formal Power Series | journal=[[American Mathematical Monthly]] | volume=76 | issue=8 | date=October 1969 | pages=871\u2013889 | doi=10.1080/00029890.1969.12000359}}</ref> Besides the ring structure operations defined above, we have the following.\n\n===Power series raised to powers===\nFor any [[natural number]] ''n'' we have\n\n:<math> \\left( \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty a_k X^k \\right)^n = \\sum_{m=0}^\\infty c_m X^m,</math>\n\nwhere\n\n:<math>\\begin{align} \nc_0 &= a_0^n,\\\\\nc_m &= \\frac{1}{m a_0} \\sum_{k=1}^m (kn - m+k) a_{k} c_{m-k}, \\ \\ \\ m \\geq 1.\n\\end{align}</math>\n\n(This formula can only be used if ''m'' and ''a''<sub>0</sub> are invertible in the ring of coefficients.)\n\nIn the case of formal power series with complex coefficients, the complex powers are well defined at least for series ''f'' with constant term equal to 1.

This means that <math>K[[X]]</math> is a [[discrete valuation ring]] with uniformizing parameter <math>X</math>.\n\n===Dividing series===\nThe computation of a quotient <math>f/g=h</math>\n\n:<math> \\frac{\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty b_n X^n }{\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty a_n X^n } =\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty c_n X^n, </math>\n\nassuming the denominator is invertible (that is, <math>a_0</math> is invertible in the ring of scalars), can be performed as a product <math>f</math> and the inverse of <math>g</math>, or directly equating the coefficients in <math>f=gh</math>:\n\n:<math>c_n = \\frac{1}{a_0}\\left(b_n - \\sum_{k=1}^n a_k c_{n-k}\\right).</math>\n\n=== Extracting coefficients ===\nThe coefficient extraction operator applied to a formal power series \n\n:<math>f(X) = \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty a_n X^n </math>\n\nin ''X'' is written\n\n:<math> \\left[ X^m \\right] f(X) </math>\n\nand extracts the coefficient of ''X<sup>m</sup>'', so that\n\n:<math> \\left[ X^m \\right] f(X) = \\left[ X^m \\right] \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty a_n X^n = a_m.</math>\n\n=== Composition of series ===\nGiven formal power series\n\n:<math>f(X) = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty a_n X^n = a_1 X + a_2 X^2 + \\cdots</math>\n:<math>g(X) = \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty b_n X^n = b_0 + b_1 X + b_2 X^2 + \\cdots,</math>\n\none may form the ''composition''\n\n:<math>g(f(X)) = \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty b_n (f(X))^n = \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty c_n X^n,</math>\n\nwhere the coefficients ''c''<sub>''n''</sub> are determined by \"expanding out\" the powers of ''f''(''X''):\n\n:<math>c_n:=\\sum_{k\\in\\N, |j|=n} b_k a_{j_1} a_{j_2} \\cdots a_{j_k}.</math>\n\nHere the sum is extended over all (''k'', ''j'') with <math>k\\in\\N</math> and <math>j\\in\\N_+^k</math> with <math>|j|:=j_1+\\cdots+j_k=n.</math>\n\nA more explicit description of these coefficients is provided by [[Fa\u00e0 di Bruno's formula#Formal power series version|Fa\u00e0 di Bruno's formula]], at least in the case where the coefficient ring is a field of [[Characteristic (algebra)|characteristic 0]].\n\nA point here is that this operation is only valid when <math>f(X)</math> has ''no constant term'', so that each <math>c_n</math> depends on only a finite number of coefficients of <math>f(X)</math> and <math>g(X)</math>. In other words, the series for <math>g(f(X))</math> converges in the [[Completion (ring theory)#Krull topology|topology]] of <math>R[[X]]</math>.\n\n==== Example ====\nAssume that the ring <math>R</math> has characteristic 0 and the nonzero integers are invertible in <math>R</math>. If we denote by <math>\\exp(X)</math> the formal power series\n\n:<math>\\exp(X) = 1 + X + \\frac{X^2}{2!} + \\frac{X^3}{3!} + \\frac{X^4}{4!} + \\cdots,</math>\n\nthen the expression\n\n:<math>\\exp(\\exp(X) - 1) = 1 + X + X^2 + \\frac{5X^3}6 + \\frac{5X^4}8 + \\cdots</math>\n\nmakes perfect sense as a formal power series. However, the statement\n\n:<math>\\exp(\\exp(X)) = e \\exp(\\exp(X) - 1) = e + eX + eX^2 + \\frac{5eX^3}{6} + \\cdots</math>\n\nis not a valid application of the composition operation for formal power series. Rather, it is confusing the notions of convergence in <math>R[[X]]</math> and convergence in <math>R</math>; indeed, the ring <math>R</math> may not even contain any number <math>e</math> with the appropriate properties.\n\n=== Composition inverse ===\nWhenever a formal series \n\n:<math>f(X)=\\sum_k f_k X^k \\in R[[X]]</math> \n\nhas ''f''<sub>0</sub> = 0 and ''f''<sub>1</sub> being an invertible element of ''R'', there exists a series \n\n:<math>g(X)=\\sum_k g_k X^k</math> \n\nthat is the [[composition inverse]] of <math>f</math>, meaning that composing <math>f</math> with <math>g</math> gives the series representing the [[identity function]] (whose first coefficient is 1 and all other coefficients are zero). The coefficients of <math>g</math> may be found recursively by using the above formula for the coefficients of a composition, equating them with those of the composition identity ''X'' (that is 1 at degree 1 and 0 at every degree greater than 1). In the case when the coefficient ring is a field of characteristic 0, the [[#The Lagrange inversion formula|Lagrange inversion formula]] provides a powerful tool to compute the coefficients of ''g'', as well as the coefficients of the (multiplicative) powers of ''g''.\n\n=== Formal differentiation of series ===\nGiven a formal power series\n\n:<math>f = \\sum_{n\\geq 0} a_n X^n \\in R[[X]],</math>\n\nwe define its '''[[formal derivative]]''', denoted ''Df'' or ''f''\u2032, by\n\n:<math> Df = \\sum_{n \\geq 1} a_n n X^{n-1}.</math>\n\nThe symbol ''D'' is called the '''formal differentiation operator'''. The motivation behind this definition is that it simply mimics term-by-term differentiation of a polynomial.\n\nThis operation is ''R''-[[linear operator|linear]]:\n\n:<math>D(af + bg) = a \\cdot Df + b \\cdot Dg</math>\n\nfor any ''a'', ''b'' in ''R'' and any ''f'', ''g'' in <math>R[[X]].</math> Additionally, the formal derivative has many of the properties of the usual [[derivative]] of calculus. For example, the [[product rule]] is valid:\n\n:<math>D(fg) = f \\cdot (Dg) + (Df) \\cdot g,</math>\n\nand the [[chain rule]] works as well:\n\n:<math>D(f\\circ g ) = ( Df\\circ g ) \\cdot Dg,</math>\n\nwhenever the appropriate compositions of series are defined (see above under [[#Composition of series|composition of series]]).\n\nThus, in these respects formal power series behave like [[Taylor series]]. Indeed, for the ''f'' defined above, we find that\n\n:<math>(D^k f)(0) = k! a_k, </math>\n\nwhere ''D''<sup>''k''</sup> denotes the ''k''th formal derivative (that is, the result of formally differentiating ''k'' times).\n\n== Properties ==\n\n=== Algebraic properties of the formal power series ring ===\n<math>R[[X]]</math> is an [[associative algebra]] over <math>R</math> which contains the ring <math>R[X]</math> of polynomials over <math>R</math>; the polynomials correspond to the sequences which end in zeros.\n\nThe [[Jacobson radical]] of <math>R[[X]]</math> is the [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]] generated by <math>X</math> and the Jacobson radical of <math>R</math>; this is implied by the element invertibility criterion discussed above.\n\nThe [[maximal ideal]]s of <math>R[[X]]</math> all arise from those in <math>R</math> in the following manner: an ideal <math>M</math> of <math>R[[X]]</math> is maximal if and only if <math>M\\cap R</math> is a maximal ideal of <math>R</math> and <math>M</math> is generated as an ideal by <math>X</math> and <math>M\\cap R</math>.\n\nSeveral algebraic properties of <math>R</math> are inherited by <math>R[[X]]</math>:\n\n* if <math>R</math> is a [[local ring]], then so is <math>R[[X]]</math>,\n\n* if <math>R</math> is [[noetherian ring|Noetherian]], then so is <math>R[[X]]</math>. This is a version of the [[Hilbert basis theorem]],\n\n* if <math>R</math> is an [[integral domain]], then so is <math>R[[X]]</math>,\n\n* if <math>K</math> is a [[field (mathematics)|field]], then <math>K[[X]]</math> is a [[discrete valuation ring]].\n\n=== Topological properties of the formal power series ring ===\nThe metric space <math>(R[[X]], d)</math> is [[completeness (topology)|complete]].\n\nThe ring <math>R[[X]]</math> is [[compact space|compact]] if and only if ''R'' is [[finite set|finite]]. This follows from [[Tychonoff's theorem]] and the characterisation of the topology on <math>R[[X]]</math> as a product topology.\n\n=== Weierstrass preparation ===\n{{main article|Weierstrass preparation theorem#Formal power series in complete local rings}}\nThe ring of formal power series with coefficients in a [[complete local ring]] satisfies the [[Weierstrass preparation theorem]].\n\n==Applications==\nFormal power series can be used to solve recurrences occurring in number theory and combinatorics. For an example involving finding a closed form expression for the [[Fibonacci number]]s, see the article on [[Examples of generating functions]].\n\nOne can use formal power series to prove several relations familiar from analysis in a purely algebraic setting. Consider for instance the following elements of <math>\\Q[[X]]</math>:\n\n:<math> \\sin(X) := \\sum_{n \\ge 0} \\frac{(-1)^n} {(2n+1)!} X^{2n+1} </math>\n:<math> \\cos(X) := \\sum_{n \\ge 0} \\frac{(-1)^n} {(2n)!} X^{2n} </math>\n\nThen one can show that\n\n:<math>\\sin^2(X) + \\cos^2(X) = 1,</math>\n:<math>\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial X} \\sin(X) = \\cos(X),</math>\n:<math>\\sin (X+Y) = \\sin(X) \\cos(Y) + \\cos(X) \\sin(Y).</math>\n\nThe last one being valid in the ring <math>\\Q[[X, Y]].</math>\n\nFor ''K'' a field, the ring <math>K[[X_1, \\ldots, X_r]]</math> is often used as the \"standard, most general\" complete local ring over ''K'' in algebra.\n\n==Interpreting formal power series as functions==\nIn [[mathematical analysis]], every convergent [[power series]] defines a [[function (mathematics)|function]] with values in the [[real number|real]] or [[complex number|complex]] numbers. Formal power series can also be interpreted as functions, but one has to be careful with the [[function domain|domain]] and [[codomain]]. Let \n\n:<math>f = \\sum a_n X^n \\in R[[X]],</math> \n\nand suppose ''S'' is a commutative associative algebra over ''R'', ''I'' is an ideal in ''S'' such that the [[I-adic topology]] on ''S'' is complete, and ''x'' is an element of ''I''. Define:\n\n:<math>f(x) = \\sum_{n\\ge 0} a_n x^n.</math>\n\nThis series is guaranteed to converge in ''S'' given the above assumptions on ''x''. Furthermore, we have\n\n:<math> (f+g)(x) = f(x) + g(x)</math>\n\nand\n\n:<math> (fg)(x) = f(x) g(x).</math>\n\nUnlike in the case of bona fide functions, these formulas are not definitions but have to be proved.\n\nSince the topology on <math>R[[X]]</math> is the (''X'')-adic topology and <math>R[[X]]</math> is complete, we can in particular apply power series to other power series, provided that the arguments don't have [[constant coefficients]] (so that they belong to the ideal (''X'')): ''f''(0), ''f''(''X''<sup>2</sup>\u2212''X'') and ''f''((1\u2212''X'')<sup>\u22121</sup>&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1) are all well defined for any formal power series <math>f \\in R[[X]].</math>\n\nWith this formalism, we can give an explicit formula for the multiplicative inverse of a power series ''f'' whose constant coefficient ''a'' = ''f''(0) is invertible in ''R'':\n\n:<math>f^{-1} = \\sum_{n \\ge 0} a^{-n-1} (a-f)^n.</math>\n\nIf the formal power series ''g'' with ''g''(0) = 0 is given implicitly by the equation\n\n:<math>f(g) =X</math>\n\nwhere ''f'' is a known power series with ''f''(0) = 0, then the coefficients of ''g'' can be explicitly computed using the [[#The Lagrange inversion formula|Lagrange inversion formula]].\n\n==Generalizations==\n\n=== Formal Laurent series ===\nA '''formal Laurent series''' over a ring <math>R</math> is defined in a similar way to a formal power series, except that we also allow finitely many terms of negative degree (this is different from the classical [[Laurent series]]), that is series of the form\n\n:<math>f = \\sum_{n\\in\\Z} a_n X^n</math>\n\nwhere '''<math>a_n=0</math> for all but finitely many negative indices <math>n</math>'''. Multiplication of such series can be defined. Indeed, similarly to the definition for formal power series, the coefficient of ''X<sup>k</sup>'' of two series with respective sequences of coefficients <math>\\{a_n\\}</math> and <math>\\{b_n\\}</math> is\n\n:<math>\\sum_{i\\in\\Z}a_ib_{k-i},</math>\n\nwhich sum is effectively finite because of the assumed vanishing of coefficients at sufficiently negative indices, and which sum zero for sufficiently negative <math>k</math> for the same reason.\n\nFor a non-zero formal Laurent series, the minimal integer <math>n</math> such that <math> a_n\\neq 0</math> is called the order of <math>f</math>, denoted <math>\\operatorname{ord}(f).</math> (The order of the zero series is <math>+\\infty</math>.) The formal Laurent series form the '''ring of formal Laurent series''' over <math>R</math>, denoted by <math>R((X))</math>. It is equal to the [[localization of a ring|localization]] of <math>R[[X]]</math> with respect to the set of positive powers of <math>X</math>. It is a topological ring with the metric:\n\n:<math>d(f,g)=2^{-\\operatorname{ord}(f-g)}.</math>\n\nIf <math>R=K</math> is a [[field (mathematics)|field]], then <math>K((X))</math> is in fact a field, which may alternatively be obtained as the [[field of fractions]] of the [[integral domain]] <math>K[[X]]</math>.\n\nOne may define formal differentiation for formal Laurent series in a natural way (term-by-term). Precisely, the formal derivative of the formal Laurent series <math>f</math> above is\n\n:<math>f' = Df = \\sum_{n\\in\\Z} na_n X^{n-1}</math>\n\nwhich is again an element of <math>K((X))</math>. Notice that if <math>f</math> is a non-constant formal Laurent series, and K is a field of characteristic 0, then one has\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{ord}(f')= \\operatorname{ord}(f)-1.</math>\n\nHowever, in general this is not the case since the factor ''n'' for the lowest order term could be equal to 0 in ''R''.\n\n====Formal residue====\nAssume that <math>K</math> is a field of [[characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] 0. Then the map\n\n:<math>D\\colon K((X))\\to K((X))</math>\n\nis a <math>K</math>-[[derivation (abstract algebra)|derivation]] that satisfies\n\n:<math>\\ker D=K</math>\n:<math>\\operatorname{im} D= \\left \\{f\\in K((X)) : [X^{-1}]f=0 \\right \\}.</math>\n\nThe latter shows that the coefficient of <math>X^{-1}</math> in <math>f</math> is of particular interest; it is called ''formal residue of <math>f</math>'' and denoted <math>\\operatorname{Res}(f)</math>. The map\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{Res} : K((X))\\to K</math>\n\nis <math>K</math>-linear, and by the above observation one has an [[exact sequence]]\n\n:<math>0 \\to K \\to K((X)) \\xrightarrow{D} K((X)) \\;\\xrightarrow{\\operatorname{Res}}\\; K \\to 0.</math>\n\n'''Some rules of calculus'''. As a quite direct consequence of the above definition, and of the rules of formal derivation, one has, for any <math>f, g\\in K((X))</math>\n:i. <math>\\operatorname{Res}(f')=0;</math>\n:ii. <math>\\operatorname{Res}(fg')=-\\operatorname{Res}(f'g);</math>\n:iii. <math>\\operatorname{Res}(f'/f)=\\operatorname{ord}(f),\\qquad \\forall f\\neq0;</math>\n:iv. <math>\\operatorname{Res}\\left(( f\\circ g) g'\\right) = \\operatorname{ord}(g)\\operatorname{Res}(f),</math> if <math>\\operatorname{ord}(g)>0;</math>\n:v. <math>[X^n]f(X)=\\operatorname{Res}\\left(X^{-n-1}f(X)\\right).</math>\n\nProperty (i) is part of the exact sequence above. Property (ii) follows from (i) as applied to <math>(fg)'=f'g+fg'</math>. Property (iii): any <math>f</math> can be written in the form <math>f=X^mg</math>, with <math>m=\\operatorname{ord}(f)</math> and <math>\\operatorname{ord}(g)=0</math>: then <math>f'/f = mX^{-1}+g'/g.</math> <math>\\operatorname{ord}(g)=0</math> implies <math>g</math> is invertible in <math>K[[X]]\\subset \\operatorname{im}(D) = \\ker(\\operatorname{Res}),</math> whence <math>\\operatorname{Res}(f'/f)=m.</math> Property (iv): Since <math>\\operatorname{im}(D) = \\ker(\\operatorname{Res}),</math> we can write <math>f=f_{-1}X^{-1}+F',</math> with <math>F \\in K((X))</math>. Consequently, <math>(f\\circ g)g'= f_{-1}g^{-1}g'+(F'\\circ g)g' = f_{-1}g'/g + (F \\circ g)'</math> and (iv) follows from (i) and (iii). Property (v) is clear from the definition.\n\n===The Lagrange inversion formula===\n{{main|Lagrange inversion theorem}}\nAs mentioned above, any formal series <math>f \\in K[[X]]</math> with ''f''<sub>0</sub> = 0 and ''f''<sub>1</sub> \u2260 0 has a composition inverse <math>g \\in K[[X]].</math> The following relation between the coefficients ''g<sup>n</sup>'' and ''f''<sup>\u2212''k''</sup> holds (\"{{Visible anchor|Lagrange inversion formula}}\"):\n\n:<math>k[X^k] g^n=n[X^{-n}]f^{-k}.</math>\n\nIn particular, for ''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1 and all ''k''&nbsp;\u2265&nbsp;1,\n\n:<math>[X^k] g=\\frac{1}{k} \\operatorname{Res}\\left( f^{-k}\\right).</math>\n\nSince the proof of the Lagrange inversion formula is a very short computation, it is worth reporting it here. Since <math>\\operatorname{ord}(f) =1 </math>, by the above rules of calculus,\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\nk[X^k] g^n & =k\\operatorname{Res}\\left( g^n X^{-k-1}  \\right)\n=k\\operatorname{Res}\\left(X^n f^{-k-1}f\\,'\\right)\n=-\\operatorname{Res}\\left(X^n (f^{-k})^'\\right) \\\\\n& =\\operatorname{Res}\\left(\\left(X^n\\right)' f^{-k}\\right)\n=n\\operatorname{Res}\\left(X^{n-1}f^{-k}\\right)\n=n[X^{-n}]f^{-k}.\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\n'''Generalizations.''' One may observe that the above computation can be repeated plainly in more general settings than ''K''((''X'')): a generalization of the Lagrange inversion formula is already available working in the <math>\\Complex((X))</math>-modules <math>X^{\\alpha}\\Complex((X)),</math> where \u03b1 is a complex exponent. As a consequence, if ''f'' and ''g'' are as above, with <math>f_1=g_1=1</math>, we can relate the complex powers of ''f''/''X'' and ''g''/''X'': precisely, if \u03b1 and \u03b2 are non-zero complex numbers with negative integer sum, <math>m=-\\alpha-\\beta\\in\\N,</math> then\n\n:<math>\\frac{1}{\\alpha}[X^m]\\left( \\frac{f}{X} \\right)^\\alpha=-\\frac{1}{\\beta}[X^m]\\left( \\frac{g}{X} \\right)^\\beta.</math>\n\nFor instance, this way one finds the power series for [[Lambert W function#Integer and complex powers|complex powers of the Lambert function]].\n\n=== Power series in several variables ===\nFormal power series in any number of indeterminates (even infinitely many) can be defined. If ''I'' is an index set and ''X<sub>I</sub>'' is the set of indeterminates ''X<sub>i</sub>'' for ''i''\u2208''I'', then a [[monomial]] ''X''<sup>\u03b1</sup> is any finite product of elements of ''X<sub>I</sub>'' (repetitions allowed); a formal power series in ''X<sub>I</sub>'' with coefficients in a ring ''R'' is determined by any mapping from the set of monomials ''X''<sup>\u03b1</sup> to a corresponding coefficient ''c''<sub>\u03b1</sub>, and is denoted <math>\\textstyle\\sum_\\alpha c_\\alpha X^\\alpha</math>. The set of all such formal power series is denoted <math>R[[X_I]],</math> and it is given a ring structure by defining\n\n:<math>\\left(\\sum_\\alpha c_\\alpha X^\\alpha\\right)+\\left(\\sum_\\alpha d_\\alpha X^\\alpha \\right)= \\sum_\\alpha (c_\\alpha+d_\\alpha) X^\\alpha</math>\n\nand\n\n:<math>\\left(\\sum_\\alpha c_\\alpha X^\\alpha\\right)\\times\\left(\\sum_\\beta d_\\beta X^\\beta\\right)=\\sum_{\\alpha,\\beta} c_\\alpha d_\\beta X^{\\alpha+\\beta}</math>\n\n==== Topology ====\nThe topology on <math>R[[X_I]]</math> is such that a sequence of its elements converges only if for each monomial ''X''<sup>\u03b1</sup> the corresponding coefficient stabilizes. If ''I'' is finite, then this the ''J''-adic topology, where ''J'' is the ideal of <math>R[[X_I]]</math> generated by all the indeterminates in ''X<sub>I</sub>''. This does not hold if ''I'' is infinite. For example, if <math>I=\\N,</math> then the sequence <math>(f_n)_{n\\in \\N}</math> with <math>f_n = X_n + X_{n+1} + X_{n+2} + \\cdots </math> does not converge with respect to any ''J''-adic topology on ''R'', but clearly for each monomial the corresponding coefficient stabilizes.\n\nAs remarked above, the topology on a repeated formal power series ring like <math>R[[X]][[Y]]</math> is usually chosen in such a way that it becomes isomorphic as a [[topological ring]] to <math>R[[X,Y]].</math>\n\n====Operations====\nAll of the operations defined for series in one variable may be extended to the several variables case.\n\n* A series is invertible if and only if its constant term is invertible in ''R''.\n\n* The composition ''f''(''g''(''X'')) of two series ''f'' and ''g'' is defined if ''f'' is a series in a single indeterminate, and the constant term of ''g'' is zero. For a series ''f'' in several indeterminates a form of \"composition\" can similarly be defined, with as many separate series in the place of ''g'' as there are indeterminates.\n\nIn the case of the formal derivative, there are now separate [[partial derivative]] operators, which differentiate with respect to each of the indeterminates. They all commute with each other.\n\n==== Universal property ====\nIn the several variables case, the universal property characterizing <math>R[[X_1, \\ldots, X_r]]</math> becomes the following. If ''S'' is a commutative associative algebra over ''R'', if ''I'' is an ideal of ''S'' such that the ''I''-adic topology on ''S'' is complete, and if ''x''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''x<sub>r</sub>'' are elements of ''I'', then there is a ''unique'' map <math>\\Phi: R[[X_1, \\ldots, X_r]] \\to S</math> with the following properties:\n\n* \u03a6 is an ''R''-algebra homomorphism\n\n* \u03a6 is continuous\n\n* \u03a6(''X''<sub>''i''</sub>) = ''x''<sub>''i''</sub> for ''i'' = 1, ..., ''r''.\n\n===Non-commuting variables===\nThe several variable case can be further generalised by taking ''non-commuting variables'' ''X<sub>i</sub>'' for ''i'' \u2208 ''I'', where ''I'' is an index set and then a [[monomial]] ''X''<sup>\u03b1</sup> is any [[word (mathematics)|word]] in the ''X<sub>I</sub>''; a formal power series in ''X<sub>I</sub>'' with coefficients in a ring ''R'' is determined by any mapping from the set of monomials ''X''<sup>\u03b1</sup> to a corresponding coefficient ''c''<sub>\u03b1</sub>, and is denoted <math>\\textstyle\\sum_\\alpha c_\\alpha X^\\alpha </math>. The set of all such formal power series is denoted ''R''\u00ab''X<sub>I</sub>''\u00bb, and it is given a ring structure by defining addition pointwise\n\n:<math>\\left(\\sum_\\alpha c_\\alpha X^\\alpha\\right)+\\left(\\sum_\\alpha d_\\alpha X^\\alpha\\right)=\\sum_\\alpha(c_\\alpha+d_\\alpha)X^\\alpha</math>\n\nand multiplication by\n\n:<math>\\left(\\sum_\\alpha c_\\alpha X^\\alpha\\right)\\times\\left(\\sum_\\alpha d_\\alpha X^\\alpha\\right)=\\sum_{\\alpha,\\beta} c_\\alpha d_\\beta X^{\\alpha} \\cdot X^{\\beta}</math>\n\nwhere \u00b7 denotes concatenation of words.

Thus a formal power series differs from a polynomial in that it may have infinitely many terms, and differs from a [[power series]], whose variables can take on numerical values. One way to view a formal power series is as an infinite ordered sequence of numbers. In this case, the powers of the variable are used only to indicate the order of the coefficients, so that the coefficient of <math>x^5</math> is the fifth term in the sequence. In [[combinatorics]], formal power series provide representations of numerical [[sequence]]s and of [[multiset]]s, and for instance allow concise expressions for [[recursion|recursively]] defined sequences regardless of whether the recursion can be explicitly solved; this is known as the method of [[generating function]]s. More generally, formal power series can include series with any finite number of variables, and with coefficients in an arbitrary [[ring (mathematics)|ring]]. Formal power series can be created from [[Taylor polynomial|Taylor polynomials]] using [[formal moduli]].\n\n==Introduction==\nA formal power series can be loosely thought of as an object that is like a [[polynomial]], but with infinitely many terms. Alternatively, for those familiar with [[power series]] (or [[Taylor series]]), one may think of a formal power series as a power series in which we ignore questions of [[Convergent series|convergence]] by not assuming that the variable ''X'' denotes any numerical value (not even an unknown value). For example, consider the series\n\n:<math>A = 1 - 3X + 5X^2 - 7X^3 + 9X^4 - 11X^5 + \\cdots.</math>\n\nIf we studied this as a power series, its properties would include, for example, that its [[radius of convergence]] is 1. However, as a formal power series, we may ignore this completely; all that is relevant is the sequence of [[coefficient]]s [1, \u22123, 5, \u22127, 9, \u221211, ...]. In other words, a formal power series is an object that just records a sequence of coefficients. It is perfectly acceptable to consider a formal power series with the [[factorial]]s [1, 1, 2, 6, 24, 120, 720, 5040, ... ] as coefficients, even though the corresponding power series diverges for any nonzero value of ''X''.\n\nArithmetic on formal power series is carried out by simply pretending that the series are polynomials. For example, if\n\n:<math>B = 2X + 4X^3 + 6X^5 + \\cdots,</math>\n\nthen we add ''A'' and ''B'' term by term:\n\n:<math>A + B = 1 - X + 5X^2 - 3X^3 + 9X^4 - 5X^5 + \\cdots.</math>\n\nWe can multiply formal power series, again just by treating them as polynomials (see in particular [[Cauchy product]]):\n\n:<math>AB = 2X - 6X^2 + 14X^3 - 26X^4 + 44X^5 + \\cdots.</math>\n\nNotice that each coefficient in the product ''AB'' only depends on a ''finite'' number of coefficients of ''A'' and ''B''. For example, the ''X''<sup>5</sup> term is given by\n\n:<math>44X^5 = (1\\times 6X^5) + (5X^2 \\times 4X^3) + (9X^4 \\times 2X).</math>\n\nFor this reason, one may multiply formal power series without worrying about the usual questions of [[absolute convergence|absolute]], [[conditional convergence|conditional]] and [[uniform convergence]] which arise in dealing with power series in the setting of [[Mathematical analysis|analysis]].\n\nOnce we have defined multiplication for formal power series, we can define multiplicative inverses as follows. The multiplicative inverse of a formal power series ''A'' is a formal power series ''C'' such that ''AC'' = 1, provided that such a formal power series exists. It turns out that if ''A'' has a multiplicative inverse, it is unique, and we denote it by ''A''<sup>\u22121</sup>. Now we can define division of formal power series by defining ''B''/''A'' to be the product ''BA''<sup>\u22121</sup>, provided that the inverse of ''A'' exists. For example, one can use the definition of multiplication above to verify the familiar formula\n\n:<math>\\frac{1}{1 + X} = 1 - X + X^2 - X^3 + X^4 - X^5 + \\cdots.</math>\n\nAn important operation on formal power series is coefficient extraction. In its most basic form, the coefficient extraction operator <math>[X^n]</math> applied to a formal power series <math>A</math> in one variable extracts the coefficient of the <math>n</math>th power of the variable, so that <math>[X^2]A=5</math> and <math>[X^5]A=-11</math>. Other examples include\n\n:<math>\\begin{align}\n\\left[X^3\\right] (B) &= 4, \\\\ \n\\left[X^2 \\right] (X + 3 X^2 Y^3 + 10 Y^6) &= 3Y^3, \\\\\n\\left[X^2Y^3 \\right] ( X + 3 X^2 Y^3 + 10 Y^6) &= 3, \\\\\n\\left[X^n \\right] \\left(\\frac{1}{1+X} \\right) &= (-1)^n, \\\\ \n\\left[X^n \\right] \\left(\\frac{X}{(1-X)^2} \\right) &= n.\n\\end{align}</math>\n\nSimilarly, many other operations that are carried out on polynomials can be extended to the formal power series setting, as explained below.\n\n==The ring of formal power series==\n{{Ring theory sidebar}}\n\nIf one considers the set of all formal power series in ''X'' with coefficients in a [[commutative ring]] ''R'', the elements of this set collectively constitute another ring which is written <math>R[[X]],</math> and called the '''ring of formal power series''' in the variable&nbsp;''X'' over ''R''.\n\n===Definition of the formal power series ring===\nOne can characterize <math>R[[X]]</math> abstractly as the [[completeness (topology)|completion]] of the [[polynomial]] ring <math>R[X]</math> equipped with a particular [[metric space|metric]]<!-- in which the powers of the ideal ''I'' of <math>R[X]</math> generated by <math>X</math> form a shrinking set of neighbourhoods of 0; a precise description would be too long to spell out here-->. This automatically gives <math>R[[X]]</math> the structure of a [[topological ring]] (and even of a complete metric space). But the general construction of a completion of a metric space is more involved than what is needed here, and would make formal power series seem more complicated than they are. \nIt is possible to describe <math>R[[X]]</math> more explicitly, and define the ring structure and topological structure separately, as follows.\n\n====Ring structure====\nAs a set, <math>R[[X]]</math> can be constructed as the set <math>R^\\N</math> of all infinite sequences of elements of <math>R</math>, indexed by the [[natural number]]s (taken to include 0). Designating a sequence whose term at index <math>n</math> is <math>a_n</math> by <math>(a_n)</math>, one defines addition of two such sequences by\n\n:<math>(a_n)_{n\\in\\N} + (b_n)_{n\\in\\N} = \\left( a_n + b_n \\right)_{n\\in\\N}</math>\n\nand multiplication by\n\n:<math>(a_n)_{n\\in\\N} \\times (b_n)_{n\\in\\N} = \\left( \\sum_{k=0}^n a_k b_{n-k} \\right)_{n\\in\\N}.</math>\n\nThis type of product is called the [[Cauchy product]] of the two sequences of coefficients, and is a sort of discrete [[convolution]]. With these operations, <math>R^\\N</math> becomes a commutative ring with zero element <math>(0,0,0,\\ldots)</math> and multiplicative identity <math>(1,0,0,\\ldots)</math>.\n\nThe product is in fact the same one used to define the product of polynomials in one indeterminate, which suggests using a similar notation. One embeds <math>R</math> into <math>R[[X]]</math> by sending any (constant) <math>a \\in R</math> to the sequence <math>(a,0,0,\\ldots)</math> and designates the sequence <math>(0,1,0,0,\\ldots)</math> by <math>X</math>; then using the above definitions every sequence with only finitely many nonzero terms can be expressed in terms of these special elements as\n\n:<math>(a_0, a_1, a_2, \\ldots, a_n, 0, 0, \\ldots) = a_0 + a_1 X + \\cdots + a_n X^n = \\sum_{i=0}^n a_i X^i;</math>\n\nthese are precisely the polynomials in <math>X</math>. Given this, it is quite natural and convenient to designate a general sequence <math>(a_n)_{n\\in\\N}</math> by the formal expression <math>\\textstyle\\sum_{i\\in\\N}a_i X^i</math>, even though the latter ''is not'' an expression formed by the operations of addition and multiplication defined above (from which only finite sums can be constructed). This notational convention allows reformulation of the above definitions as\n\n:<math>\\left(\\sum_{i\\in\\N} a_i X^i\\right)+\\left(\\sum_{i\\in\\N} b_i X^i\\right) = \\sum_{i\\in\\N}(a_i+b_i) X^i</math>\n\nand\n\n:<math>\\left(\\sum_{i\\in\\N} a_i X^i\\right) \\times \\left(\\sum_{i\\in\\N} b_i X^i\\right) = \\sum_{n\\in\\N} \\left(\\sum_{k=0}^n a_k b_{n-k}\\right) X^n.</math>\n\nwhich is quite convenient, but one must be aware of the distinction between formal summation (a mere convention) and actual addition.\n\n==== Topological structure ====\nHaving stipulated conventionally that\n\n:<math>(a_0, a_1, a_2, a_3, \\ldots) = \\sum_{i=0}^\\infty a_i X^i, \\qquad (1)</math>\n\none would like to interpret the right hand side as a well-defined infinite summation. To that end, a notion of convergence in <math>R^\\N</math> is defined and a [[topology]] on <math>R^\\N</math> is constructed. There are several equivalent ways to define the desired topology.\n\n* We may give <math>R^\\N</math> the [[product topology]], where each copy of <math>R</math> is given the [[discrete topology]].\n\n* We may give <math>R^\\N</math> the [[I-adic topology]], where <math>I=(X)</math> is the ideal generated by <math>X</math>, which consists of all sequences whose first term <math>a_0</math> is zero.\n\n* The desired topology could also be derived from the following [[metric space|metric]]. The distance between distinct sequences <math>(a_n), (b_n) \\in R^{\\N},</math> is defined to be\n::<math>d((a_n), (b_n)) = 2^{-k},</math>\n:where <math>k</math> is the smallest [[natural number]] such that <math>a_k\\neq b_k</math>; the distance between two equal sequences is of course zero.\n\nInformally, two sequences <math>\\{a_n\\}</math> and <math>\\{b_n\\}</math> become closer and closer if and only if more and more of their terms agree exactly. Formally, the sequence of [[partial sum]]s of some infinite summation converges if for every fixed power of <math>X</math> the coefficient stabilizes: there is a point beyond which all further partial sums have the same coefficient. This is clearly the case for the right hand side of (1), regardless of the values <math>a_n</math>, since inclusion of the term for <math>i=n</math> gives the last (and in fact only) change to the coefficient of <math>X^n</math>. It is also obvious that the [[limit of a sequence|limit]] of the sequence of partial sums is equal to the left hand side.\n\nThis topological structure, together with the ring operations described above, form a topological ring. This is called the '''ring of formal power series over <math>R</math>''' and is denoted by <math>R[[X]]</math>. The topology has the useful property that an infinite summation converges if and only if the sequence of its terms converges to 0, which just means that any fixed power of <math>X</math> occurs in only finitely many terms.\n\nThe topological structure allows much more flexible usage of infinite summations. For instance the rule for multiplication can be restated simply as\n\n:<math>\\left(\\sum_{i\\in\\N} a_i X^i\\right) \\times \\left(\\sum_{i\\in\\N} b_i X^i\\right) = \\sum_{i,j\\in\\N} a_i b_j X^{i+j},</math>\n\nsince only finitely many terms on the right affect any fixed <math>X^n</math>. Infinite products are also defined by the topological structure; it can be seen that an infinite product converges if and only if the sequence of its factors converges to 1.\n\n==== Alternative topologies ====\nThe above topology is the [[Comparison of topologies|finest topology]] for which \n\n:<math>\\sum_{i=0}^\\infty a_i X^i</math> \n\nalways converges as a summation to the formal power series designated by the same expression, and it often suffices to give a meaning to infinite sums and products, or other kinds of limits that one wishes to use to designate particular formal power series. It can however happen occasionally that one wishes to use a coarser topology, so that certain expressions become convergent that would otherwise diverge. This applies in particular when the base ring <math>R</math> already comes with a topology other than the discrete one, for instance if it is also a ring of formal power series.\n\nConsider the ring of formal power series: <math>\\Z[[X]][[Y]]</math>; then the topology of above construction only relates to the indeterminate <math>Y</math>, since the topology that was put on <math>\\Z[[X]]</math> has been replaced by the discrete topology when defining the topology of the whole ring. So\n\n:<math>\\sum_{i\\in\\N}XY^i</math>\n\nconverges to the power series suggested, which can be written as <math>\\tfrac{X}{1-Y}</math>; however the summation\n\n:<math>\\sum_{i\\in\\N}X^iY</math>\n\nwould be considered to be divergent, since every term affects the coefficient of <math>Y</math> (which coefficient is itself a power series in <math>X</math>). This asymmetry disappears if the power series ring in <math>Y</math> is given the product topology where each copy of <math>\\Z[[X]]</math> is given its topology as a ring of formal power series rather than the discrete topology. As a consequence, for convergence of a sequence of elements of <math>\\Z[[X]][[Y]]</math> it then suffices that the coefficient of each power of <math>Y</math> converges to a formal power series in <math>X</math>, a weaker condition than stabilizing entirely; for instance in the second example given here the coefficient of <math>Y</math>converges to <math>\\tfrac{1}{1-X}</math>, so the whole summation converges to <math>\\tfrac{Y}{1-X}</math>.\n\nThis way of defining the topology is in fact the standard one for repeated constructions of rings of formal power series, and gives the same topology as one would get by taking formal power series in all indeterminates at once. In the above example that would mean constructing <math>\\Z[[X,Y]],</math> and here a sequence converges if and only if the coefficient of every monomial <math>X^iY^j</math> stabilizes. This topology, which is also the <math>I</math>-adic topology, where <math>I=(X,Y)</math> is the ideal generated by <math>X</math> and <math>Y</math>, still enjoys the property that a summation converges if and only if its terms tend to 0.\n\nThe same principle could be used to make other divergent limits converge. For instance in <math>\\R[[X]]</math> the limit\n\n:<math>\\lim_{n\\to\\infty}\\left(1+\\frac{X}{n}\\right)^n</math>\n\ndoes not exist, so in particular it does not converge to \n\n:<math>\\exp(X)=\\sum_{n\\in\\N}\\frac{X^n}{n!}.</math>\n\nThis is because for <math>i\\geq 2</math> the coefficient <math>\\tbinom{n}{i}/n^i</math> of <math>X^i</math> does not stabilize as <math>n\\to \\infty</math>. It does however converge in the usual topology of <math>\\R</math>, and in fact to the coefficient <math>\\tfrac{1}{i!}</math> of <math>\\exp(X)</math>. Therefore, if one would give <math>\\R[[X]]</math> the product topology of <math>\\R^\\N</math> where the topology of <math>\\R</math> is the usual topology rather than the discrete one, then the above limit would converge to <math>\\exp(X)</math>. This more permissive approach is not however the standard when considering formal power series, as it would lead to convergence considerations that are as subtle as they are in [[analysis (mathematics)|analysis]], while the philosophy of formal power series is on the contrary to make convergence questions as trivial as they can possibly be. With this topology it would ''not'' be the case that a summation converges if and only if its terms tend to 0.\n\n===Universal property===\nThe ring <math>R[[X]]</math> may be characterized by the following [[universal property]]. If <math>S</math> is a commutative associative algebra over <math>R</math>, if <math>I</math> is an ideal of <math>S</math> such that the <math>I</math>-adic topology on <math>S</math> is complete, and if <math>x</math> is an element of <math>I</math>, then there is a ''unique'' <math>\\Phi: R[[X]]\\to S</math> with the following properties:\n\n* <math>\\Phi</math> is an <math>R</math>-algebra homomorphism\n\n* <math>\\Phi</math> is continuous\n\n* <math>\\Phi(X)=x</math>.\n\n== Operations on formal power series ==\nOne can perform algebraic operations on power series to generate new power series.<ref name=\"Zwillinger_2014\">{{cite book |author-first1=Izrail Solomonovich |author-last1=Gradshteyn |author-link1=Izrail Solomonovich Gradshteyn |author-first2=Iosif Moiseevich |author-last2=Ryzhik |author-link2=Iosif Moiseevich Ryzhik |author-first3=Yuri Veniaminovich |author-last3=Geronimus |author-link3 =Yuri Veniaminovich Geronimus |author-first4=Michail Yulyevich |author-last4=Tseytlin |author-link4=Michail Yulyevich Tseytlin |author-first5=Alan |author-last5=Jeffrey |editor1-first=Daniel |editor1-last=Zwillinger |editor2-first=Victor Hugo |editor2-last=Moll |translator=Scripta Technica, Inc. |title=Table of Integrals, Series, and Products |publisher=[[Academic Press, Inc.]] |date=2015 |orig-year=October 2014 |edition=8 |language=English |isbn=978-0-12-384933-5 |lccn=2014010276 <!-- |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NjnLAwAAQBAJ |access-date=2016-02-21-->|titlelink=Gradshteyn and Ryzhik |chapter=0.313 |page=18}} (Several previous editions as well.)</ref><ref name=formalpowerseries>{{cite journal | first=Ivan | last=Niven | authorlink=Ivan Niven | title=Formal Power Series | journal=[[American Mathematical Monthly]] | volume=76 | issue=8 | date=October 1969 | pages=871\u2013889 | doi=10.1080/00029890.1969.12000359}}</ref> Besides the ring structure operations defined above, we have the following.\n\n===Power series raised to powers===\nFor any [[natural number]] ''n'' we have\n\n:<math> \\left( \\sum_{k=0}^\\infty a_k X^k \\right)^n = \\sum_{m=0}^\\infty c_m X^m,</math>\n\nwhere\n\n:<math>\\begin{align} \nc_0 &= a_0^n,\\\\\nc_m &= \\frac{1}{m a_0} \\sum_{k=1}^m (kn - m+k) a_{k} c_{m-k}, \\ \\ \\ m \\geq 1.\n\\end{align}</math>\n\n(This formula can only be used if ''m'' and ''a''<sub>0</sub> are invertible in the ring of coefficients.)\n\nIn the case of formal power series with complex coefficients, the complex powers are well defined at least for series ''f'' with constant term equal to 1.

This means that <math>K[[X]]</math> is a [[discrete valuation ring]] with uniformizing parameter <math>X</math>.\n\n===Dividing series===\nThe computation of a quotient <math>f/g=h</math>\n\n:<math> \\frac{\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty b_n X^n }{\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty a_n X^n } =\\sum_{n=0}^\\infty c_n X^n, </math>\n\nassuming the denominator is invertible (that is, <math>a_0</math> is invertible in the ring of scalars), can be performed as a product <math>f</math> and the inverse of <math>g</math>, or directly equating the coefficients in <math>f=gh</math>:\n\n:<math>c_n = \\frac{1}{a_0}\\left(b_n - \\sum_{k=1}^n a_k c_{n-k}\\right).</math>\n\n=== Extracting coefficients ===\nThe coefficient extraction operator applied to a formal power series \n\n:<math>f(X) = \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty a_n X^n </math>\n\nin ''X'' is written\n\n:<math> \\left[ X^m \\right] f(X) </math>\n\nand extracts the coefficient of ''X<sup>m</sup>'', so that\n\n:<math> \\left[ X^m \\right] f(X) = \\left[ X^m \\right] \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty a_n X^n = a_m.</math>\n\n=== Composition of series ===\nGiven formal power series\n\n:<math>f(X) = \\sum_{n=1}^\\infty a_n X^n = a_1 X + a_2 X^2 + \\cdots</math>\n:<math>g(X) = \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty b_n X^n = b_0 + b_1 X + b_2 X^2 + \\cdots,</math>\n\none may form the ''composition''\n\n:<math>g(f(X)) = \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty b_n (f(X))^n = \\sum_{n=0}^\\infty c_n X^n,</math>\n\nwhere the coefficients ''c''<sub>''n''</sub> are determined by \"expanding out\" the powers of ''f''(''X''):\n\n:<math>c_n:=\\sum_{k\\in\\N, |j|=n} b_k a_{j_1} a_{j_2} \\cdots a_{j_k}.</math>\n\nHere the sum is extended over all (''k'', ''j'') with <math>k\\in\\N</math> and <math>j\\in\\N_+^k</math> with <math>|j|:=j_1+\\cdots+j_k=n.</math>\n\nA more explicit description of these coefficients is provided by [[Fa\u00e0 di Bruno's formula#Formal power series version|Fa\u00e0 di Bruno's formula]], at least in the case where the coefficient ring is a field of [[Characteristic (algebra)|characteristic 0]].\n\nA point here is that this operation is only valid when <math>f(X)</math> has ''no constant term'', so that each <math>c_n</math> depends on only a finite number of coefficients of <math>f(X)</math> and <math>g(X)</math>. In other words, the series for <math>g(f(X))</math> converges in the [[Completion (ring theory)#Krull topology|topology]] of <math>R[[X]]</math>.\n\n==== Example ====\nAssume that the ring <math>R</math> has characteristic 0 and the nonzero integers are invertible in <math>R</math>. If we denote by <math>\\exp(X)</math> the formal power series\n\n:<math>\\exp(X) = 1 + X + \\frac{X^2}{2!} + \\frac{X^3}{3!} + \\frac{X^4}{4!} + \\cdots,</math>\n\nthen the expression\n\n:<math>\\exp(\\exp(X) - 1) = 1 + X + X^2 + \\frac{5X^3}6 + \\frac{5X^4}8 + \\cdots</math>\n\nmakes perfect sense as a formal power series. However, the statement\n\n:<math>\\exp(\\exp(X)) = e \\exp(\\exp(X) - 1) = e + eX + eX^2 + \\frac{5eX^3}{6} + \\cdots</math>\n\nis not a valid application of the composition operation for formal power series. Rather, it is confusing the notions of convergence in <math>R[[X]]</math> and convergence in <math>R</math>; indeed, the ring <math>R</math> may not even contain any number <math>e</math> with the appropriate properties.\n\n=== Composition inverse ===\nWhenever a formal series \n\n:<math>f(X)=\\sum_k f_k X^k \\in R[[X]]</math> \n\nhas ''f''<sub>0</sub> = 0 and ''f''<sub>1</sub> being an invertible element of ''R'', there exists a series \n\n:<math>g(X)=\\sum_k g_k X^k</math> \n\nthat is the [[composition inverse]] of <math>f</math>, meaning that composing <math>f</math> with <math>g</math> gives the series representing the [[identity function]] (whose first coefficient is 1 and all other coefficients are zero). The coefficients of <math>g</math> may be found recursively by using the above formula for the coefficients of a composition, equating them with those of the composition identity ''X'' (that is 1 at degree 1 and 0 at every degree greater than 1). In the case when the coefficient ring is a field of characteristic 0, the [[#The Lagrange inversion formula|Lagrange inversion formula]] provides a powerful tool to compute the coefficients of ''g'', as well as the coefficients of the (multiplicative) powers of ''g''.\n\n=== Formal differentiation of series ===\nGiven a formal power series\n\n:<math>f = \\sum_{n\\geq 0} a_n X^n \\in R[[X]],</math>\n\nwe define its '''[[formal derivative]]''', denoted ''Df'' or ''f''\u2032, by\n\n:<math> Df = \\sum_{n \\geq 1} a_n n X^{n-1}.</math>\n\nThe symbol ''D'' is called the '''formal differentiation operator'''. The motivation behind this definition is that it simply mimics term-by-term differentiation of a polynomial.\n\nThis operation is ''R''-[[linear operator|linear]]:\n\n:<math>D(af + bg) = a \\cdot Df + b \\cdot Dg</math>\n\nfor any ''a'', ''b'' in ''R'' and any ''f'', ''g'' in <math>R[[X]].</math> Additionally, the formal derivative has many of the properties of the usual [[derivative]] of calculus. For example, the [[product rule]] is valid:\n\n:<math>D(fg) = f \\cdot (Dg) + (Df) \\cdot g,</math>\n\nand the [[chain rule]] works as well:\n\n:<math>D(f\\circ g ) = ( Df\\circ g ) \\cdot Dg,</math>\n\nwhenever the appropriate compositions of series are defined (see above under [[#Composition of series|composition of series]]).\n\nThus, in these respects formal power series behave like [[Taylor series]]. Indeed, for the ''f'' defined above, we find that\n\n:<math>(D^k f)(0) = k! a_k, </math>\n\nwhere ''D''<sup>''k''</sup> denotes the ''k''th formal derivative (that is, the result of formally differentiating ''k'' times).\n\n== Properties ==\n\n=== Algebraic properties of the formal power series ring ===\n<math>R[[X]]</math> is an [[associative algebra]] over <math>R</math> which contains the ring <math>R[X]</math> of polynomials over <math>R</math>; the polynomials correspond to the sequences which end in zeros.\n\nThe [[Jacobson radical]] of <math>R[[X]]</math> is the [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]] generated by <math>X</math> and the Jacobson radical of <math>R</math>; this is implied by the element invertibility criterion discussed above.\n\nThe [[maximal ideal]]s of <math>R[[X]]</math> all arise from those in <math>R</math> in the following manner: an ideal <math>M</math> of <math>R[[X]]</math> is maximal if and only if <math>M\\cap R</math> is a maximal ideal of <math>R</math> and <math>M</math> is generated as an ideal by <math>X</math> and <math>M\\cap R</math>.\n\nSeveral algebraic properties of <math>R</math> are inherited by <math>R[[X]]</math>:\n\n* if <math>R</math> is a [[local ring]], then so is <math>R[[X]]</math>,\n\n* if <math>R</math> is [[noetherian ring|Noetherian]], then so is <math>R[[X]]</math>. This is a version of the [[Hilbert basis theorem]],\n\n* if <math>R</math> is an [[integral domain]], then so is <math>R[[X]]</math>,\n\n* if <math>K</math> is a [[field (mathematics)|field]], then <math>K[[X]]</math> is a [[discrete valuation ring]].\n\n=== Topological properties of the formal power series ring ===\nThe metric space <math>(R[[X]], d)</math> is [[completeness (topology)|complete]].\n\nThe ring <math>R[[X]]</math> is [[compact space|compact]] if and only if ''R'' is [[finite set|finite]]. This follows from [[Tychonoff's theorem]] and the characterisation of the topology on <math>R[[X]]</math> as a product topology.\n\n=== Weierstrass preparation ===\n{{main article|Weierstrass preparation theorem#Formal power series in complete local rings}}\nThe ring of formal power series with coefficients in a [[complete local ring]] satisfies the [[Weierstrass preparation theorem]].\n\n==Applications==\nFormal power series can be used to solve recurrences occurring in number theory and combinatorics. For an example involving finding a closed form expression for the [[Fibonacci number]]s, see the article on [[Examples of generating functions]].\n\nOne can use formal power series to prove several relations familiar from analysis in a purely algebraic setting. Consider for instance the following elements of <math>\\Q[[X]]</math>:\n\n:<math> \\sin(X) := \\sum_{n \\ge 0} \\frac{(-1)^n} {(2n+1)!} X^{2n+1} </math>\n:<math> \\cos(X) := \\sum_{n \\ge 0} \\frac{(-1)^n} {(2n)!} X^{2n} </math>\n\nThen one can show that\n\n:<math>\\sin^2(X) + \\cos^2(X) = 1,</math>\n:<math>\\frac{\\partial}{\\partial X} \\sin(X) = \\cos(X),</math>\n:<math>\\sin (X+Y) = \\sin(X) \\cos(Y) + \\cos(X) \\sin(Y).</math>\n\nThe last one being valid in the ring <math>\\Q[[X, Y]].</math>\n\nFor ''K'' a field, the ring <math>K[[X_1, \\ldots, X_r]]</math> is often used as the \"standard, most general\" complete local ring over ''K'' in algebra.\n\n==Interpreting formal power series as functions==\nIn [[mathematical analysis]], every convergent [[power series]] defines a [[function (mathematics)|function]] with values in the [[real number|real]] or [[complex number|complex]] numbers. Formal power series can also be interpreted as functions, but one has to be careful with the [[function domain|domain]] and [[codomain]]. Let \n\n:<math>f = \\sum a_n X^n \\in R[[X]],</math> \n\nand suppose ''S'' is a commutative associative algebra over ''R'', ''I'' is an ideal in ''S'' such that the [[I-adic topology]] on ''S'' is complete, and ''x'' is an element of ''I''. Define:\n\n:<math>f(x) = \\sum_{n\\ge 0} a_n x^n.</math>\n\nThis series is guaranteed to converge in ''S'' given the above assumptions on ''x''. Furthermore, we have\n\n:<math> (f+g)(x) = f(x) + g(x)</math>\n\nand\n\n:<math> (fg)(x) = f(x) g(x).</math>\n\nUnlike in the case of bona fide functions, these formulas are not definitions but have to be proved.\n\nSince the topology on <math>R[[X]]</math> is the (''X'')-adic topology and <math>R[[X]]</math> is complete, we can in particular apply power series to other power series, provided that the arguments don't have [[constant coefficients]] (so that they belong to the ideal (''X'')): ''f''(0), ''f''(''X''<sup>2</sup>\u2212''X'') and ''f''((1\u2212''X'')<sup>\u22121</sup>&nbsp;\u2212&nbsp;1) are all well defined for any formal power series <math>f \\in R[[X]].</math>\n\nWith this formalism, we can give an explicit formula for the multiplicative inverse of a power series ''f'' whose constant coefficient ''a'' = ''f''(0) is invertible in ''R'':\n\n:<math>f^{-1} = \\sum_{n \\ge 0} a^{-n-1} (a-f)^n.</math>\n\nIf the formal power series ''g'' with ''g''(0) = 0 is given implicitly by the equation\n\n:<math>f(g) =X</math>\n\nwhere ''f'' is a known power series with ''f''(0) = 0, then the coefficients of ''g'' can be explicitly computed using the [[#The Lagrange inversion formula|Lagrange inversion formula]].\n\n==Generalizations==\n\n=== Formal Laurent series ===\nA '''formal Laurent series''' over a ring <math>R</math> is defined in a similar way to a formal power series, except that we also allow finitely many terms of negative degree (this is different from the classical [[Laurent series]]), that is series of the form\n\n:<math>f = \\sum_{n\\in\\Z} a_n X^n</math>\n\nwhere '''<math>a_n=0</math> for all but finitely many negative indices <math>n</math>'''. Multiplication of such series can be defined. Indeed, similarly to the definition for formal power series, the coefficient of ''X<sup>k</sup>'' of two series with respective sequences of coefficients <math>\\{a_n\\}</math> and <math>\\{b_n\\}</math> is\n\n:<math>\\sum_{i\\in\\Z}a_ib_{k-i},</math>\n\nwhich sum is effectively finite because of the assumed vanishing of coefficients at sufficiently negative indices, and which sum zero for sufficiently negative <math>k</math> for the same reason.\n\nFor a non-zero formal Laurent series, the minimal integer <math>n</math> such that <math> a_n\\neq 0</math> is called the order of <math>f</math>, denoted <math>\\operatorname{ord}(f).</math> (The order of the zero series is <math>+\\infty</math>.) The formal Laurent series form the '''ring of formal Laurent series''' over <math>R</math>, denoted by <math>R((X))</math>. It is equal to the [[localization of a ring|localization]] of <math>R[[X]]</math> with respect to the set of positive powers of <math>X</math>. It is a topological ring with the metric:\n\n:<math>d(f,g)=2^{-\\operatorname{ord}(f-g)}.</math>\n\nIf <math>R=K</math> is a [[field (mathematics)|field]], then <math>K((X))</math> is in fact a field, which may alternatively be obtained as the [[field of fractions]] of the [[integral domain]] <math>K[[X]]</math>.\n\nOne may define formal differentiation for formal Laurent series in a natural way (term-by-term). Precisely, the formal derivative of the formal Laurent series <math>f</math> above is\n\n:<math>f' = Df = \\sum_{n\\in\\Z} na_n X^{n-1}</math>\n\nwhich is again an element of <math>K((X))</math>. Notice that if <math>f</math> is a non-constant formal Laurent series, and K is a field of characteristic 0, then one has\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{ord}(f')= \\operatorname{ord}(f)-1.</math>\n\nHowever, in general this is not the case since the factor ''n'' for the lowest order term could be equal to 0 in ''R''.\n\n====Formal residue====\nAssume that <math>K</math> is a field of [[characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]] 0. Then the map\n\n:<math>D\\colon K((X))\\to K((X))</math>\n\nis a <math>K</math>-[[derivation (abstract algebra)|derivation]] that satisfies\n\n:<math>\\ker D=K</math>\n:<math>\\operatorname{im} D= \\left \\{f\\in K((X)) : [X^{-1}]f=0 \\right \\}.</math>\n\nThe latter shows that the coefficient of <math>X^{-1}</math> in <math>f</math> is of particular interest; it is called ''formal residue of <math>f</math>'' and denoted <math>\\operatorname{Res}(f)</math>. The map\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{Res} : K((X))\\to K</math>\n\nis <math>K</math>-linear, and by the above observation one has an [[exact sequence]]\n\n:<math>0 \\to K \\to K((X)) \\xrightarrow{D} K((X)) \\;\\xrightarrow{\\operatorname{Res}}\\; K \\to 0.</math>\n\n'''Some rules of calculus'''. As a quite direct consequence of the above definition, and of the rules of formal derivation, one has, for any <math>f, g\\in K((X))</math>\n:i. <math>\\operatorname{Res}(f')=0;</math>\n:ii. <math>\\operatorname{Res}(fg')=-\\operatorname{Res}(f'g);</math>\n:iii. <math>\\operatorname{Res}(f'/f)=\\operatorname{ord}(f),\\qquad \\forall f\\neq0;</math>\n:iv. <math>\\operatorname{Res}\\left(( f\\circ g) g'\\right) = \\operatorname{ord}(g)\\operatorname{Res}(f),</math> if <math>\\operatorname{ord}(g)>0;</math>\n:v. <math>[X^n]f(X)=\\operatorname{Res}\\left(X^{-n-1}f(X)\\right).</math>\n\nProperty (i) is part of the exact sequence above. Property (ii) follows from (i) as applied to <math>(fg)'=f'g+fg'</math>. Property (iii): any <math>f</math> can be written in the form <math>f=X^mg</math>, with <math>m=\\operatorname{ord}(f)</math> and <math>\\operatorname{ord}(g)=0</math>: then <math>f'/f = mX^{-1}+g'/g.</math> <math>\\operatorname{ord}(g)=0</math> implies <math>g</math> is invertible in <math>K[[X]]\\subset \\operatorname{im}(D) = \\ker(\\operatorname{Res}),</math> whence <math>\\operatorname{Res}(f'/f)=m.</math> Property (iv): Since <math>\\operatorname{im}(D) = \\ker(\\operatorname{Res}),</math> we can write <math>f=f_{-1}X^{-1}+F',</math> with <math>F \\in K((X))</math>. Consequently, <math>(f\\circ g)g'= f_{-1}g^{-1}g'+(F'\\circ g)g' = f_{-1}g'/g + (F \\circ g)'</math> and (iv) follows from (i) and (iii). Property (v) is clear from the definition.\n\n===The Lagrange inversion formula===\n{{main|Lagrange inversion theorem}}\nAs mentioned above, any formal series <math>f \\in K[[X]]</math> with ''f''<sub>0</sub> = 0 and ''f''<sub>1</sub> \u2260 0 has a composition inverse <math>g \\in K[[X]].</math> The following relation between the coefficients ''g<sup>n</sup>'' and ''f''<sup>\u2212''k''</sup> holds (\"{{Visible anchor|Lagrange inversion formula}}\"):\n\n:<math>k[X^k] g^n=n[X^{-n}]f^{-k}.</math>\n\nIn particular, for ''n''&nbsp;=&nbsp;1 and all ''k''&nbsp;\u2265&nbsp;1,\n\n:<math>[X^k] g=\\frac{1}{k} \\operatorname{Res}\\left( f^{-k}\\right).</math>\n\nSince the proof of the Lagrange inversion formula is a very short computation, it is worth reporting it here. Since <math>\\operatorname{ord}(f) =1 </math>, by the above rules of calculus,\n\n:<math>\n\\begin{align}\nk[X^k] g^n & =k\\operatorname{Res}\\left( g^n X^{-k-1}  \\right)\n=k\\operatorname{Res}\\left(X^n f^{-k-1}f\\,'\\right)\n=-\\operatorname{Res}\\left(X^n (f^{-k})^'\\right) \\\\\n& =\\operatorname{Res}\\left(\\left(X^n\\right)' f^{-k}\\right)\n=n\\operatorname{Res}\\left(X^{n-1}f^{-k}\\right)\n=n[X^{-n}]f^{-k}.\n\\end{align}\n</math>\n\n'''Generalizations.''' One may observe that the above computation can be repeated plainly in more general settings than ''K''((''X'')): a generalization of the Lagrange inversion formula is already available working in the <math>\\Complex((X))</math>-modules <math>X^{\\alpha}\\Complex((X)),</math> where \u03b1 is a complex exponent. As a consequence, if ''f'' and ''g'' are as above, with <math>f_1=g_1=1</math>, we can relate the complex powers of ''f''/''X'' and ''g''/''X'': precisely, if \u03b1 and \u03b2 are non-zero complex numbers with negative integer sum, <math>m=-\\alpha-\\beta\\in\\N,</math> then\n\n:<math>\\frac{1}{\\alpha}[X^m]\\left( \\frac{f}{X} \\right)^\\alpha=-\\frac{1}{\\beta}[X^m]\\left( \\frac{g}{X} \\right)^\\beta.</math>\n\nFor instance, this way one finds the power series for [[Lambert W function#Integer and complex powers|complex powers of the Lambert function]].\n\n=== Power series in several variables ===\nFormal power series in any number of indeterminates (even infinitely many) can be defined. If ''I'' is an index set and ''X<sub>I</sub>'' is the set of indeterminates ''X<sub>i</sub>'' for ''i''\u2208''I'', then a [[monomial]] ''X''<sup>\u03b1</sup> is any finite product of elements of ''X<sub>I</sub>'' (repetitions allowed); a formal power series in ''X<sub>I</sub>'' with coefficients in a ring ''R'' is determined by any mapping from the set of monomials ''X''<sup>\u03b1</sup> to a corresponding coefficient ''c''<sub>\u03b1</sub>, and is denoted <math>\\textstyle\\sum_\\alpha c_\\alpha X^\\alpha</math>. The set of all such formal power series is denoted <math>R[[X_I]],</math> and it is given a ring structure by defining\n\n:<math>\\left(\\sum_\\alpha c_\\alpha X^\\alpha\\right)+\\left(\\sum_\\alpha d_\\alpha X^\\alpha \\right)= \\sum_\\alpha (c_\\alpha+d_\\alpha) X^\\alpha</math>\n\nand\n\n:<math>\\left(\\sum_\\alpha c_\\alpha X^\\alpha\\right)\\times\\left(\\sum_\\beta d_\\beta X^\\beta\\right)=\\sum_{\\alpha,\\beta} c_\\alpha d_\\beta X^{\\alpha+\\beta}</math>\n\n==== Topology ====\nThe topology on <math>R[[X_I]]</math> is such that a sequence of its elements converges only if for each monomial ''X''<sup>\u03b1</sup> the corresponding coefficient stabilizes. If ''I'' is finite, then this the ''J''-adic topology, where ''J'' is the ideal of <math>R[[X_I]]</math> generated by all the indeterminates in ''X<sub>I</sub>''. This does not hold if ''I'' is infinite. For example, if <math>I=\\N,</math> then the sequence <math>(f_n)_{n\\in \\N}</math> with <math>f_n = X_n + X_{n+1} + X_{n+2} + \\cdots </math> does not converge with respect to any ''J''-adic topology on ''R'', but clearly for each monomial the corresponding coefficient stabilizes.\n\nAs remarked above, the topology on a repeated formal power series ring like <math>R[[X]][[Y]]</math> is usually chosen in such a way that it becomes isomorphic as a [[topological ring]] to <math>R[[X,Y]].</math>\n\n====Operations====\nAll of the operations defined for series in one variable may be extended to the several variables case.\n\n* A series is invertible if and only if its constant term is invertible in ''R''.\n\n* The composition ''f''(''g''(''X'')) of two series ''f'' and ''g'' is defined if ''f'' is a series in a single indeterminate, and the constant term of ''g'' is zero. For a series ''f'' in several indeterminates a form of \"composition\" can similarly be defined, with as many separate series in the place of ''g'' as there are indeterminates.\n\nIn the case of the formal derivative, there are now separate [[partial derivative]] operators, which differentiate with respect to each of the indeterminates. They all commute with each other.\n\n==== Universal property ====\nIn the several variables case, the universal property characterizing <math>R[[X_1, \\ldots, X_r]]</math> becomes the following. If ''S'' is a commutative associative algebra over ''R'', if ''I'' is an ideal of ''S'' such that the ''I''-adic topology on ''S'' is complete, and if ''x''<sub>1</sub>, ..., ''x<sub>r</sub>'' are elements of ''I'', then there is a ''unique'' map <math>\\Phi: R[[X_1, \\ldots, X_r]] \\to S</math> with the following properties:\n\n* \u03a6 is an ''R''-algebra homomorphism\n\n* \u03a6 is continuous\n\n* \u03a6(''X''<sub>''i''</sub>) = ''x''<sub>''i''</sub> for ''i'' = 1, ..., ''r''.\n\n===Non-commuting variables===\nThe several variable case can be further generalised by taking ''non-commuting variables'' ''X<sub>i</sub>'' for ''i'' \u2208 ''I'', where ''I'' is an index set and then a [[monomial]] ''X''<sup>\u03b1</sup> is any [[word (mathematics)|word]] in the ''X<sub>I</sub>''; a formal power series in ''X<sub>I</sub>'' with coefficients in a ring ''R'' is determined by any mapping from the set of monomials ''X''<sup>\u03b1</sup> to a corresponding coefficient ''c''<sub>\u03b1</sub>, and is denoted <math>\\textstyle\\sum_\\alpha c_\\alpha X^\\alpha </math>. The set of all such formal power series is denoted ''R''\u00ab''X<sub>I</sub>''\u00bb, and it is given a ring structure by defining addition pointwise\n\n:<math>\\left(\\sum_\\alpha c_\\alpha X^\\alpha\\right)+\\left(\\sum_\\alpha d_\\alpha X^\\alpha\\right)=\\sum_\\alpha(c_\\alpha+d_\\alpha)X^\\alpha</math>\n\nand multiplication by\n\n:<math>\\left(\\sum_\\alpha c_\\alpha X^\\alpha\\right)\\times\\left(\\sum_\\alpha d_\\alpha X^\\alpha\\right)=\\sum_{\\alpha,\\beta} c_\\alpha d_\\beta X^{\\alpha} \\cdot X^{\\beta}</math>\n\nwhere \u00b7 denotes concatenation of words.

The elements <math>(r,w)\\in S</math> are called the coefficients of <math>r</math>.\n\nFor <math>r\\in S\\langle\\langle \\Sigma^*\\rangle\\rangle</math> the support of <math>r</math> is the set\n\n:<math>\\operatorname{supp}(r)=\\{w\\in\\Sigma^*|\\ (r,w)\\neq 0\\}</math>\n\nA series where every coefficient is either <math>0</math> or <math>1</math> is called the characteristic series of its support.\n\nThe subset of <math>S\\langle\\langle \\Sigma^*\\rangle\\rangle</math> consisting of all series with a finite support is denoted by <math>S\\langle \\Sigma^*\\rangle</math> and called polynomials.\n\nFor <math>r_1, r_2\\in S\\langle\\langle \\Sigma^*\\rangle\\rangle</math> and <math>s\\in S</math>, the sum <math>r_1+r_2</math> is defined by \n:<math>(r_1+r_2,w)=(r_1,w)+(r_2,w)</math>\nThe (Cauchy) product <math>r_1\\cdot r_2</math> is defined by\n:<math>(r_1\\cdot r_2,w) = \\sum_{w_1w_2=w}(r_1,w_1)(r_2,w_2)</math>\nThe Hadamard product <math>r_1\\odot r_2</math> is defined by\n:<math>(r_1\\odot r_2,w)=(r_1,w)(r_2,w)</math>\nAnd the products by a scalar <math>sr_1</math> and <math>r_1s</math> by\n:<math>(sr_1,w)=s(r_1,w)</math> and <math>(r_1s,w)=(r_1,w)s</math>, respectively.\n\nWith these operations <math>(S\\langle\\langle \\Sigma^*\\rangle\\rangle,+,\\cdot,0,\\varepsilon)</math> and <math>(S\\langle \\Sigma^*\\rangle, +,\\cdot,0,\\varepsilon)</math> are semirings, where <math>\\varepsilon</math> is the empty word in <math>\\Sigma^*</math>.\n\nThese formal power series are used to model the behavior of [[weighted automata]], in [[theoretical computer science]], when the coefficients <math>(r,w)</math> of the series are taken to be the weight of a path with label <math>w</math> in the automata.<!-- the correct symbols for the double angled braces are &#10218; and &#10219; but they work poorly in many browsers.

Then <math>R((G))</math> is the ring of formal power series on <math>G</math>; because of the condition that the indexing set be well-ordered the product is well-defined, and we of course assume that two elements which differ by zero are the same.
