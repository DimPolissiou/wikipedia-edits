''Halakha'' is often translated as \"Jewish Law\", although a more literal translation might be \"the way to behave\" or \"the way of walking\". The word derives from the [[Semitic root|root]] that means \"to behave\" (also \"to go\" or \"to walk\"). ''Halakha'' guides not only religious practices and beliefs, but also numerous aspects of day-to-day life.<ref>[https://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/halakhah-the-laws-of-jewish-life/ \"Halacha: The Laws of Jewish Life.\"] ''My Jewish Learning''. 8 April 2019.</ref>\n\nHistorically, in the [[Jewish diaspora]], ''halakha'' served many Jewish communities as an enforceable avenue of law \u2013 both [[Civil law (legal system)|civil]] and [[religious law|religious]], since no differentiation exists in classical Judaism. Since the Jewish Enlightenment (''[[Haskalah]]'') and [[Jewish emancipation]], some have come to view the ''halakha'' as less binding in day-to-day life, as it relies on rabbinic interpretation, as opposed to the authoritative, canonical text recorded in the [[Hebrew Bible]]. Under contemporary [[Israeli law]], certain areas of Israeli family and personal status law are under the authority of the rabbinic courts, so are treated according to ''halakha''. Some differences in ''halakha'' are found among [[Ashkenazi]], [[Mizrahi]], [[Sephardi]], [[Yemenite Jews|Yemenite]], [[Beta Israel|Ethiopian]] and other Jewish communities who historically lived in isolation.<ref>[https://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/jewish-customs/ \"Jewish Custom (Minhag) Versus Law (Halacha).\"] ''My Jewish Learning''. 8 April 2019.</ref>\n\n== Etymology and terminology ==\n[[File:Talmud set.JPG|thumb|right|upright=1.35|A full set of the Babylonian Talmud]]\nThe word ''halakha'' is derived from the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] root ''halakh'' \u2013 \"to walk\" or \"to go\".<ref name=\"EncJudaica\">{{cite book |title= Encyclopaedia Judaica |edition= 2 |volume=0 |issue=8 |chapter= Halakhah |first= Louis |last= Jacobs}}</ref>{{rp|252}} Taken literally, therefore, ''halakha'' translates as \"the way to walk\", rather than \"law\". The word ''halakha'' refers to the corpus of rabbinic legal texts, or to the overall system of religious law. The term may also be related to [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] ''{{lang|akk|ilku}}'', a property tax, rendered in Aramaic as ''{{lang|arc|halakh}}'', designating one or several obligations.<ref name=\"EBR Schiffman\">{{cite encyclopedia |url= https://www.academia.edu/23518527 |title= Halakhah |section= Second Temple and Hellenistic Judaism |first= Lawrence H. |last= Schiffman |encyclopedia= Encyclopedia of the Bible and Its Reception |volume=11 |pages=2\u20138 |publisher= De Gruyter |access-date=10 October 2018}}</ref>\n\n''Halakha'' is often contrasted with ''[[aggadah]]'' (\"the telling\"), the diverse corpus of rabbinic [[Exegesis|exegetical]], narrative, philosophical, mystical, and other \"non-legal\" texts.<ref name=\"EBR Schiffman\"/> At the same time, since writers of ''halakha'' may draw upon the aggadic and even mystical literature, a dynamic interchange occurs between the genres. ''Halakha'' also does not include the parts of the [[Torah]] not related to commandments.\n\n''Halakha'' constitutes the practical application of the [[613 mitzvot|613 ''mitzvot'']] (\"commandments\") in the Torah, as developed through discussion and debate in the classical [[rabbinic literature]], especially the [[Mishnah]] and the [[Talmud]] (the \"[[Oral Torah]]\"), and as codified in the ''[[Mishneh Torah]]'' and ''[[Shulchan Aruch]]''.<ref>[https://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/halakhic-texts-101/ \"Introduction to Halacha, the Jewish Legal Tradition.\"] ''My Jewish Learning''. 8 April 2019.</ref> Because ''halakha'' is developed and applied by various halakhic authorities rather than one sole \"official voice\", different individuals and communities may well have different answers to halakhic questions. With few exceptions, controversies are not settled through authoritative structures because during the [[Jewish diaspora]], Jews lacked a single judicial hierarchy or appellate review process for ''halakha''.\n\n== Commandments (mitzvot) ==\n{{Main|Mitzvah#Mitzvot and Jewish law|613 commandments}}\nAccording to the Talmud (''Tractate Makot''), 613 ''mitzvot'' are in the Torah, 248 positive (\"thou shalt\") ''mitzvot'' and 365 negative (\"thou shalt not\") ''mitzvot'', supplemented by seven ''mitzvot'' [[Mitzvah#Rabbinical mitzvot|legislated by the rabbis]] of antiquity.<ref>Hecht, Mendy.

These laws are composed of the following:\n** The [[Written Torah]], laws written in the [[Hebrew Bible]].\n** The [[Oral Torah]], laws believed to have been transmitted orally prior to their later compilation in texts such as the Mishnah, Talmud, and rabbinic codes.\n* Laws of human origin including rabbinic decrees, interpretations, customs, etc.\n\nThis division between revealed and rabbinic commandments may influence the importance of a rule, its enforcement and the nature of its ongoing interpretation.<ref name=\"Sinclair\" /> Halakhic authorities may disagree on which laws fall into which categories or the circumstances (if any) under which prior rabbinic rulings can be re-examined by contemporary rabbis, but all Halakhic Jews hold that both categories exist and that the first category is immutable, with exceptions only for life-saving and similar emergency circumstances.\n\nA second classical distinction is between the Written Law, laws written in the [[Hebrew Bible]], and the Oral Law, laws which are believed to have been transmitted orally prior to their later compilation in texts such as the Mishnah, Talmud, and rabbinic codes.\n\nCommandments are divided into positive and negative commands, which are treated differently in terms of divine and human punishment. Positive commandments ''require'' an action to be performed and are considered to bring the performer closer to God. Negative commandments (traditionally 365 in number) ''forbid'' a specific action, and violations create a distance from God.\n\nA further division is made between ''chukim'' (\"decrees\" \u2013 laws without obvious explanation, such as ''[[shatnez]]'', the law prohibiting wearing clothing made of mixtures of linen and wool), ''mishpatim'' (\"judgements\" \u2013 laws with obvious social implications) and ''eduyot'' (\"testimonies\" or \"commemorations\", such as the [[Shabbat]] and holidays). Through the ages, various rabbinical authorities have classified some of the 613 commandments in many ways.\n\nA different approach divides the laws into a different set of categories:{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n* Laws in relation to God (''bein adam laMakom'', literally, \"between a person and the Place\"), and\n* Laws about relations with other people (''bein adam le-chavero'', literally, \"between a person and his friend\").\n\n== Sources and process ==\n<div class=\"floatright toccolours\" style=\"width:400px; width:calc(200px + 15vw); max-width:100%; box-sizing:border-box\">\n<div style=\"font-weight:bold;text-align:center\">Eras of Jewish law</div>\n* Chazal (literally, \"Our Sages, may their memory be blessed\"): all Jewish sages of the [[Mishna]], [[Tosefta]] and [[Talmud]] eras (c. 250 BCE \u2013 c. 625 CE).\n** The ''[[Zugot]]'' (literally, the \"pairs\"), both the 200-year period (c. 170 BCE \u2013 30 CE, \"Era of the Pairs\") during the Second TemplePeriod in which the spiritual leadership was in the hands of five successions of \"pairs\" of religious teachers, and to each of these pairs themselves.\n** The ''[[Tannaim]]'' (literally, the \"repeaters\") were rabbis living primarily in [[Eretz Yisrael]] who codified the [[Oral Torah]] in the form of the [[Mishnah]]; (0\u2013200 CE).\n** The ''[[Amoraim]]'' (literally, the \"sayers\") lived in both Eretz Yisrael and [[Babylonia]].

Y. Baer (in Zion, 17 (1951\u201352), 1\u201355) has argued that there was little pure academic legal activity at this period and that many of the laws originating at this time were produced by a means of neighbourly good conduct rules in a similar way as carried out by Greeks in the age of Solon. For example, the first chapter of Bava Kamma, contains a formulation of the law of torts worded in the first person.<ref name=\"EncJudaica\" />{{rp|256}}\n\nThe boundaries of Jewish law are determined through the Halakhic process, a religious-ethical system of legal reasoning. Rabbis generally base their opinions on the primary sources of ''halakha'' as well as on precedent set by previous rabbinic opinions. The major sources and genre of ''halakha'' consulted include:\n* The foundational Talmudic literature (especially the [[Mishna]] and the [[Talmud|Babylonian Talmud]]) with commentaries;\n** [[Talmudic hermeneutics]]: the science which defines the rules and methods for the investigation and exact determination of the meaning of the Scriptures; includes also the rules by which the Halakhot are derived from and established by the written law. These may be seen as the rules by which early Jewish law was derived.\n** ''[[Gemara]]'' \u2013 the Talmudic process of elucidating the ''halakha''\n* The post-Talmudic codificatory literature, such as Maimonides's [[Mishneh Torah]] and the [[Shulchan Aruch]] with its commentaries;\n* Regulations and other \"legislative\" enactments promulgated by rabbis and communal bodies:\n** ''[[Gezeirah]]'' (literally, \"declaration\"): \"preventative legislation\" of the rabbis, intended to prevent violations of the [[mitzva|commandments]]\n** ''[[Takkanah]]'' (literally, \"Repair\", meaning also \"Regulation\"): \"positive legislation\", practices instituted by the rabbis not based (directly) on the [[mitzva|commandments]]\n* ''[[Minhag]]'': Customs, community practices, and customary law, as well as the exemplary deeds of prominent (or local) rabbis;\n* The ''[[responsa|she'eloth u-teshuvoth]]'' (responsa, literally, \"questions and answers\") literature.\n* ''[[Dina d'malkhuta dina|Dina d'malchuta dina]]'' (literally, \"the law of the king is law\"): an additional aspect of ''halakha'', being the principle recognizing non-Jewish laws and non-Jewish legal jurisdiction as binding on Jewish citizens, provided that they are not contrary to a law in Judaism. This principle applies primarily in areas of commercial, civil and criminal law.\n\nIn antiquity, the ''[[Sanhedrin]]'' functioned essentially as the Supreme Court and legislature (in the US judicial system) for Judaism, and had the power to administer binding law, including both received law and its own rabbinic decrees, on all Jews\u2014rulings of the Sanhedrin became ''halakha''; see [[Oral law#Oral law in Judaism|Oral law]]. That court ceased to function in its full mode in 40 CE. Today, the authoritative application of Jewish law is left to the local rabbi, and the local rabbinical courts, with only local applicability. In branches of Judaism that follow ''halakha'', lay individuals make numerous ad-hoc decisions, but are regarded as not having authority to decide certain issues definitively.\n\nSince the days of the Sanhedrin, however, no body or authority has been generally regarded as having the authority to create universally recognized precedents. As a result, ''halakha'' has developed in a somewhat different fashion from Anglo-American legal systems with a Supreme Court able to provide universally accepted precedents. Generally, Halakhic arguments are effectively, yet unofficially, peer-reviewed. When a rabbinic ''[[posek]]'' (literally, \"he who makes a statement\", \"decisor\") proposes an additional interpretation of a law, that interpretation may be considered binding for the posek's questioner or immediate community. Depending on the stature of the posek and the quality of the decision, an interpretation may also be gradually accepted by other rabbis and members of other Jewish communities.\n\nUnder this system there is a tension between the relevance of earlier and later authorities in constraining Halakhic interpretation and innovation. On the one hand, there is a principle in ''halakha'' not to overrule a specific law from an earlier era, after it is accepted by the community as a law or [[vow]],<ref>[[Moshe Isserles|Rema]] [[Choshen Mishpat]] Chapter 25</ref> unless supported by another, relevant earlier precedent; see list below. On the other hand, another principle recognizes the responsibility and authority of later authorities, and especially the ''posek'' handling a then-current question. In addition, the ''halakha'' embodies a wide range of principles that permit judicial discretion and deviation (Ben-Menahem).\n\nNotwithstanding the potential for innovation, rabbis and Jewish communities differ greatly on how they make changes in ''halakha''. Notably, ''poskim'' frequently extend the application of a law to new situations, but do not consider such applications as constituting a \"change\" in ''halakha''. For example, many [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] rulings concerning electricity are derived from rulings concerning fire, as closing an electrical circuit may cause a spark. In contrast, Conservative ''poskim'' consider that switching on electrical equipment is physically and chemically more like turning on a water tap (which is permissible by ''halakha'') than lighting a fire (which is not permissible), and therefore permitted on Shabbat. The reformative [[Judaism]] in some cases explicitly interprets ''halakha'' to take into account its view of contemporary society. For instance, most Conservative rabbis extend the application of certain Jewish obligations and permissible activities to women (see [[Halakha#Conservative Judaism|below]]).\n\nWithin certain Jewish communities, formal organized bodies do exist. Within [[Modern Orthodox Judaism]], there is no one committee or leader, but Modern US-based Orthodox rabbis generally agree with the views set by consensus by the leaders of the [[Rabbinical Council of America]]. Within [[Conservative Judaism]], the [[Rabbinical Assembly]] has an official [[Committee on Jewish Law and Standards]].<ref>[https://www.rabbinicalassembly.org/jewish-law/committee-jewish-law-and-standards \"Committee on Jewish Law and Standards.\"] ''The Rabbinical Assembly''. 9 April 2019.</ref>\n\nNote that Takkanot, the plural form of ''Takkanah'' above, in general do not affect or restrict observance of Torah ''mitzvot''. (In common parlance sometimes people use the general term ''takkanah'' to refer either ''gezeirot'' or ''takkanot''.) However, the Talmud states that in exceptional cases, the Sages had the authority to \"uproot matters from the Torah\". In Talmudic and classical Halakhic literature, this authority refers to the authority to prohibit some things that would otherwise be Biblically sanctioned (''shev v'al ta'aseh'', literally, ''thou shall stay seated and not do''). Rabbis may rule that a specific mitzvah from the Torah should not be performed, e. g., blowing the ''[[shofar]]'' on Shabbat, or taking the ''[[Four Species|lulav and etrog]]'' on Shabbat. These examples of takkanot which may be executed out of caution lest some might otherwise carry the mentioned items between home and the synagogue, thus inadvertently violating a Sabbath ''[[Activities prohibited on Shabbat|melakha]]''. Another rare and limited form of takkanah involved overriding Torah prohibitions. In some cases, the Sages allowed the temporary violation of a prohibition in order to maintain the Jewish system as a whole. This was part of the basis for [[Esther]]'s relationship with [[Ahasuerus]] (Xeres). For general usage of takkanaot in Jewish history see the article [[Takkanah]]. For examples of this being used in Conservative Judaism, see [[Conservative halakha]].\n\n=== Historical analysis ===\n{{Eras of the Halakha}}\nThe antiquity of the rules can be determined only by the dates of the authorities who quote them; in general, they cannot safely be declared older than the tanna (from Aramaic, literally, \"repeater\") to whom they are first ascribed. It is certain, however, that the seven middot (literally, \"measurements\", and referring to [good] behavior) of Hillel and the thirteen of Ishmael are earlier than the time of Hillel himself, who was the first to transmit them.\n\nThe Talmud gives no information concerning the origin of the middot, although the Geonim (\"Sages\") regarded them as Sinaitic ([[Law given to Moses at Sinai]]). The Artscroll Series writes in its Overview to the book of Ezra:<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Writings = Kesuvim / The Writings : with a commentary anthologized from Rabbinic writings = Ketuvim : \u02bbim Perush Rashi, Metsudat Da\u1e7fid, Metsudat Tsiyon, \u1e7fe-\u02bbod|others=Scherman, Nosson,, Zlotowitz, Meir|isbn=1422617246|edition= First|location=Brooklyn, N.Y.|oclc=951078375}}</ref>\n\n\"During the Mishnaitic and Talmudic periods, the Sages of Israel... took the eternal tools of exegesis and used them to reveal the secrets that had always been locked within the words of the Torah, secrets that Moses had taught Israel and that, in turn, had been transmitted orally for over a thousand years until the oral tradition began to crumble due to persecution and a lack of diligence. They did nothing new and certainly made no changes in the Torah; they merely made use of hermeneutic principles that had not been need while the tradition of study was still at its study was still at its zenith.\" (pg. xii-xiii)\n\nThe middot seem to have been first laid down as abstract rules by the teachers of Hillel, though they were not immediately recognized by all as valid and binding.  Different schools interpreted and modified them, restricted or expanded them, in various ways. [[Rabbi Akiva]] and [[rabbi Ishmael]] and their scholars especially contributed to the development or establishment of these rules. \"It must be borne in mind, however, that neither Hillel, Ishmael, nor [a contemporary of theirs named] [[Eliezer ben Jose]] sought to give a complete enumeration of the rules of interpretation current in his day, but that they omitted from their collections many rules which were then followed.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/10801-middot-the-seven-of-hillel|title=TALMUD HERMENEUTICS - JewishEncyclopedia.com|website=www.jewishencyclopedia.com|access-date=2019-09-25}}</ref>\n\nAkiva devoted his attention particularly to the grammatical and exegetical rules, while Ishmael developed the logical. The rules laid down by one school were frequently rejected by another because the principles that guided them in their respective formulations were essentially different. According to Akiva, the divine language of the Torah is distinguished from the speech of men by the fact that in the former no word or sound is superfluous.\n\nSome scholars have observed a similarity between these rabbinic rules of interpretation and the hermeneutics of ancient Hellenistic culture. For example, Saul Lieberman argues that the names of rabbi Ishmael's ''middot'' (e. g., ''kal vahomer'', literally, a combination of the archaic form of the word for \"straw\" and the word for \"clay\" \u2013 \"straw and clay\", referring to the obvious [means of making a mud brick]) are Hebrew translations of Greek terms, although the methods of those ''middot'' are not Greek in origin.<ref>{{cite book |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books/?id=0OcaAAAAMAAJ |access-date=10 October 2018 |last=Lieberman |first=Saul |chapter=Rabbinic interpretation of scripture |year=1962 |title=Hellenism in Jewish Palestine |publisher=Jewish Theological Seminary of America |page=47}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books/?id=0OcaAAAAMAAJ |access-date=10 October 2018 |last=Lieberman |first=Saul |chapter=The Hermeneutic Rules of the ''Aggadah'' |year=1962 |title=Hellenism in Jewish Palestine |publisher=Jewish Theological Seminary of America |page=68}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title=Rabbinic methods of interpretation and Hellenistic rhetoric |first=David |last=Daube |journal=Hebrew Union College Annual |volume=22 |year=1949 |pages=239\u2013264 |jstor=23506588}}</ref>\n\n== Views today ==\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = Midrash22.jpg\n| width1 = 150\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Aaron22.jpg\n| width2 = 141\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = The artistic freedom spirit of ''Aggadah'' (left, represented by [[Solomon]]) and the legal divine judgment rulings of ''[[Halakhah]] (right, represented by [[Aaron]] and his sons) on the [[Knesset Menorah]]\n}}\n{{See also|Talmud#Present day}}\n[[Orthodox Judaism]] holds that ''halakha'' is the [[divine law]] as laid out in the Torah (five books of Moses), rabbinical laws, rabbinical decrees, and customs combined.

While there are a wide variety of Conservative views, a common belief is that ''halakha'' is, and has always been, an evolving process subject to interpretation by rabbis in every time period. See [[Conservative Judaism#Beliefs|Conservative Judaism, Beliefs]].\n\n[[Reconstructionist Judaism]] holds that halakha is normative and binding, while also believing that it is an evolving concept and that the traditional halakhic system is incapable of producing a code of conduct that is meaningful for, and acceptable to, the vast majority of contemporary Jews. Reconstructionist founder [[Mordecai Kaplan]] believed that \"Jewish life [is] meaningless without Jewish law.\", and one of the planks of the Society for the Jewish Renascence, of which Kaplan was one of the founders, stated: \"We accept the halakha, which is rooted in the Talmud, as the norm of Jewish life, availing ourselves, at the same time, of the method implicit therein to interpret and develop the body of Jewish Law in accordance with the actual conditions and spiritual needs of modern life.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=Reconstructing Halakha |url=https://www.reconstructingjudaism.org/article/reconstructing-halakha |last=Cedarbaum |first=Daniel |agency=Reconstructing Judaism |date=6 May 2016 |access-date=30 January 2020}}</ref>\n\n[[Reform Judaism]] holds that modern views of how the Torah and rabbinic law developed imply that the body of rabbinic Jewish law is no longer normative (seen as binding) on Jews today. Those in the \"traditionalist\" wing believe that the ''halakha'' represents a personal starting-point, holding that each Jew is obligated to interpret the Torah, Talmud and other Jewish works for themselves, and this interpretation will create separate commandments for each person. Those in the liberal and classical wings of Reform believe that in this day and era, most Jewish religious rituals are no longer necessary, and many hold that following most Jewish laws is actually counter-productive. They propose that Judaism has entered a phase of ethical monotheism, and that the laws of Judaism are only remnants of an earlier stage of religious evolution, and need not be followed. This is considered wrong, and even [[heresy|heretical]], by Orthodox and Conservative Judaism.\n\nHumanistic Jews value the Torah as a historical, political, and sociological text written by their ancestors. They do not believe \"that every word of the Torah is true, or even morally correct, just because the Torah is old\". The Torah is both disagreed with and questioned. Humanistic Jews believe that the entire Jewish experience, and not only the Torah, should be studied as a source for Jewish behavior and ethical values.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://oradam.org/OAC/FAQ/ |title=FAQ for Humanistic Judaism, Reform Judaism, Humanists, Humanistic Jews, Congregation, Arizona, AZ |publisher=Oradam.org |access-date=10 October 2018}}</ref>\n\nJews believe that [[gentiles]] are bound by a subset of ''halakha'' called the [[Seven Laws of Noah]], also referred to as the Noahide Laws. They are a set of imperatives which, according to the Talmud, were given by God to the \"children of Noah\" \u2013 that is, all of humanity.<ref>[https://www.britannica.com/topic/Noahide-Laws \"Noahide Laws.\"] ''Encyclopedia Britannica''. 3 July 2019.</ref>\n\n=== Flexibility ===\nDespite its internal rigidity, ''halakha'' has a degree of flexibility in finding solutions to modern problems that are not explicitly mentioned in the Torah. From the very beginnings of Rabbinic Judaism, halakhic inquiry allowed for a \"sense of continuity between past and present, a self-evident trust that their pattern of life and belief now conformed to the sacred patterns and beliefs presented by scripture and tradition\".<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VahYCwAAQBAJ |title=Jews, Christians, Muslims: A Comparative Introduction to Monotheistic Religions |date=2016 |publisher=Routledge |first1=John |last1=Corrigan |first2=Frederick |last2=Denny |first3=Martin S. |last3=Jaffee |first4=Carlos |last4=Eire |isbn=9780205018253 |edition= 2 |access-date=10 October 2018}}</ref> According to an analysis by Jewish scholar Jeffrey Rubenstein of Michael Berger's book ''Rabbinic Authority'', the authority that rabbis hold \"derives not from the institutional or personal authority of the sages but from a ''communal'' decision to recognize that authority, much as a community recognizes a certain judicial system to resolve its disputes and interpret its laws.\"<ref>{{cite journal |last= Rubenstein |first= Jeffrey L. |title= Michael Berger.

The classical approach has permitted new rulings regarding modern technology. For example, some of these rulings guide Jewish observers about the proper use of [[electricity]] on the Sabbath and holidays. Often, as to the applicability of the law in any given situation, the proviso is to \"consult your local rabbi or [[posek]]\". This notion lends rabbis a certain degree of local authority; however, for more complex questions the issue is passed onto higher rabbis who will then issue a ''teshuvot'', which is a ''responsa'' that is binding.<ref>Satlow, Michael, and Daniel Picus. \u201cJudaism, Christianity, and Islam.\u201d Lecture. Providence, Brown University.</ref> Indeed, rabbis will continuously issue different opinions and will constantly review each other's work so as to maintain the truest sense of ''halakha''. Overall, this process allows rabbis to maintain connection of traditional Jewish law to modern life. Of course, the degree of flexibility depends on the sect of Judaism, with Reform being the most flexible, Conservative somewhat in the middle, and Orthodox being much more stringent and rigid. Modern critics, however, have charged that with the rise of movements that challenge the \"divine\" authority of ''halakha'', traditional Jews have greater reluctance to change, not only the laws themselves but also other customs and habits, than traditional Rabbinical Judaism did prior to the advent of Reform in the 19th century.\n\n=== Denominational approaches ===\n==== Orthodox Judaism ====\n[[File:Haredim allant a la synagogue.jpg|thumb|Hasidim walk to the synagogue, [[Rehovot]], [[Israel]].]]\nOrthodox Jews believe that ''halakha'' is a religious system whose core represents the [[Revelation|revealed]] will of God. Although Orthodox Judaism acknowledges that rabbis have made many decisions and decrees regarding Jewish Law where the written Torah itself is nonspecific, they did so only in accordance with regulations received by [[Moses]] on [[Mount Sinai, Egypt|Mount Sinai]] (see {{Bibleref2|Deuteronomy 5:8\u201313}}). These regulations were transmitted orally until shortly after the destruction of the [[Second Temple]]. They were then recorded in the [[Mishnah]], and explained in the Talmud and commentaries throughout history up until the present day. Orthodox Judaism believes that subsequent interpretations have been derived with the utmost accuracy and care. The most widely accepted codes of Jewish law are known as [[Mishneh Torah]] and the [[Shulchan Aruch]].<ref name=\"JillJacobs\">Jacobs, Jill. [https://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/the-shulhan-arukh/ \"The Shulchan Aruch.\"] ''My Jewish Learning''. 8 April 2019.</ref>\n\nOrthodox Judaism has a range of opinions on the circumstances and extent to which change is permissible. [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] Jews generally hold that even ''minhagim'' (customs) must be retained, and existing precedents cannot be reconsidered. [[Modern Orthodox]] authorities are more inclined to permit limited changes in customs and some reconsideration of precedent.<ref>Sokol, Sam.

However, the Torah is still held as mankind's record of its understanding of God's revelation, and thus still has divine authority. Therefore, ''halakha'' is still seen as binding. Conservative Jews use modern methods of historical study to learn how Jewish law has changed over time, and are, in some cases, willing to change Jewish law in the present.<ref>[https://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/halakhah-in-conservative-judaism/ \"Halakhah in Conservative Judaism.\"] ''My Jewish Learning''. 8 April 2019.</ref>\n\nA key practical difference between Conservative and Orthodox approaches is that Conservative Judaism holds that its rabbinical body's powers are not limited to reconsidering later precedents based on earlier sources, but the [[Committee on Jewish Law and Standards]] (CJLS) is empowered to override Biblical and Taanitic prohibitions by ''takkanah'' (decree) when perceived to be inconsistent with modern requirements or views of ethics. The CJLS has used this power on a number of occasions, most famously in the \"driving teshuva\", which says that if someone is unable to walk to any synagogue on the Sabbath, and their commitment to observance is so loose that not attending synagogue may lead them to drop it altogether, their rabbi may give them a dispensation to drive there and back; and more recently in its decision prohibiting the taking of evidence on [[Mamzer]] status on the grounds that implementing such a status is immoral. The CJLS has also held that the Talmudic concept of ''[[Kavod HaBriyot]]'' permits lifting rabbinic decrees (as distinct from carving narrow exceptions) on grounds of human dignity, and used this principle in a December 2006 opinion lifting all rabbinic prohibitions on [[Homosexuality|homosexual]] conduct (the opinion held that only male-male anal sex was forbidden by the [[the Bible and homosexuality|Bible]] and that this remained prohibited). Conservative Judaism also made a number of changes to the [[role of women in Judaism]] including counting women in a [[minyan]],<ref>Fine, David J.

[http://www.cwj.org.il/sites/default/files/Mamzerut%20-%20Spitz.pdf \"Mamzerut.\"] ''Committee on Jewish Law and Standards of the Rabbinical Assembly''. EH 4.2000a. p. 586.</ref> The CJLS adopted the responsum's view that the \"morality which we learn through the larger, unfolding narrative of our tradition\" informs the application of Mosaic law.<ref name=\"KaplanSpitz\" /> The responsum cited several examples of how the rabbinic sages declined to enforce punishments explicitly mandated by Torah law. The examples include the trial of the accused adulteress (''sotah''), the \"law of breaking the neck of the heifer,\" and the application of the death penalty for the \"rebellious child.\"<ref>Kaplan Spitz, p. 577-584.</ref> Kaplan Spitz argues that the punishment of the ''mamzer'' has been effectively inoperative for nearly two thousand years due to deliberate rabbinic inaction. Further he suggested that the rabbis have long regarded the punishment declared by the Torah as immoral, and came to the conclusion that no court should agree to hear testimony on ''mamzerut''.\n\n== Codes of Jewish law ==\n:'' The halakhic codes have influenced, and in turn, have been influenced by, the responsa; [[History of responsa in Judaism]] thus provides an informative complement to the below.''\nThe most important codifications of Jewish law include:\n* The Mishnah, composed by [[Judah haNasi|Rabbi Judah the Prince]], in 200&nbsp;CE, as a basic outline of the state of the Oral Law in his time. This was the framework upon which the Talmud was based; the Talmud's [[dialectic]] analysis of the content of the Mishna (''[[gemara]]''; completed c.&nbsp;500) became the basis for all later [[posek|halakhic decisions]] and subsequent [[codification (law)|codes]].\n* [[Codification (law)|Codification]]s by the [[Geonim]] of the halakhic material in the Talmud. \n** An early work, ''She'iltot'' (\"Questions\") by [[Achai of Shabcha]] (c.&nbsp;752), discusses over 190 ''mitzvot'' \u2013 exploring and addressing various questions on these. \n** The first legal [[codex]] proper, ''Halakhot Pesukot'' (\"Decided Laws\"), by [[Yehudai Gaon]] (c.&nbsp;760), rearranges the Talmud passages in a structure manageable to the layman. (It was written in [[Aramaic language#Jewish Middle Babylonian Aramaic|vernacular Aramaic]], and subsequently translated into [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] as ''Hilkhot Riu''). \n** ''Halakhot Gedolot'' (\"Great Law Book\"), by R.[[Simeon Kayyara]], published two generations later, contains extensive additional material, mainly from [[Responsa]] and [[Monograph]]s of the Geonim, and is presented in a form that is closer to the original Talmud language and structure. (Probably since it was distributed, also, amongst the newly established [[Ashkenazi]] communities.) The ''She'iltot'' was influential on both subsequent works.\n* The [[Hilchot HaRif]], was written by the Rabbi [[Isaac Alfasi]] (1013\u20131103), it has summations of the legal material found in the Talmud. Alfasi transcribed the Talmud's halakhic conclusions verbatim, without the surrounding deliberation; he also excluded all aggadic (non-legal, and homiletic) matter. The ''Hilchot'' soon superseded the geonic codes, as it contained all the decisions and the laws then relevant, and additionally, served as an accessible Talmudic commentary; it has been printed with almost every subsequent edition of the Talmud.\n* The [[Mishneh Torah]] by [[Maimonides]] (1135\u20131204). This work encompasses the full range of Talmudic law; it is organized and reformulated in a logical system \u2013 in 14 books, 83 sections and 1000 chapters \u2013 with each ''halakha'' stated clearly. The Mishneh Torah is very influential to this day, and several later works reproduce passages verbatim. It also includes a section on [[Metaphysics]] and [[Jewish principles of faith|fundamental beliefs]]. (Some claim this section draws heavily on [[Aristotle|Aristotelian]] science and metaphysics; others suggest that it is within the tradition of [[Saadia Gaon]].) It is the main source of practical ''halakha'' for many [[Yemenite Jews]] \u2013 mainly [[Baladi]] and [[Dor Daim]] \u2013 as well as for a growing community referred to as ''[[Dor Daim#Talmide ha-Rambam|talmidei haRambam]]''.\n* The work of ''the Rosh'', Rabbi [[Asher ben Jehiel]] (1250?/1259?\u20131328), an abstract of the Talmud, concisely stating the final halakhic decision and quoting later authorities, notably Alfasi, Maimonides, and the [[Tosafists]]. This work superseded Rabbi Alfasi's and has been printed with almost every subsequent edition of the Talmud.\n* The ''[[Sefer Mitzvot Gadol]]'' (The \"SeMaG\") of Rabbi [[Moses ben Jacob of Coucy]] (first half of the 13th century, [[Coucy-le-Ch\u00e2teau-Auffrique|Coucy]], Northern France). \"SeMaG\" is organised around the 365 negative and the 248 positive commandments, separately discussing each of them according to the Talmud (in light of the commentaries of [[Rashi]] and the [[Tosafot]]) and the other codes existent at the time. ''[[Sefer Mitzvot Katan]]'' (\"SeMaK\") by [[Isaac ben Joseph of Corbeil]] is an abridgement of the ''SeMaG'', including additional practical ''halakha'', as well as agaddic and [[Musar literature|ethical]] material.\n* \"The Mordechai\" \u2013 by [[Mordecai ben Hillel]], d.&nbsp;[[Nuremberg]] 1298 \u2013 serves both as a source of analysis, as well of decided law. Mordechai considered about 350 halakhic authorities, and was widely influential, particularly amongst the Ashkenazi and [[Italian Jews#Italian rite Jews|Italian]] communities. Although organised around the ''Hilchot'' of ''the Rif'', it is, in fact, an independent work. It has been printed with every edition of the Talmud since 1482.\n[[File:Arba'ah Turim.jpg|thumb|200px|An illuminated manuscript of ''Arba'ah Turim'' from 1435.]]\n* The [[Arba'ah Turim]] (''The Tur'', lit. \"The Four Columns\") by Rabbi [[Jacob ben Asher]] (1270\u20131343, [[Toledo, Spain]]). This work traces the ''halakha'' from the Torah text and the Talmud through the [[Rishonim]], with the ''Hilchot'' of Alfasi as its starting point. Ben Asher followed Maimonides's precedent in arranging his work in a topical order, however, the Tur covers only those areas of Jewish law that were in force in the author's time. The code is divided into four main sections; almost all codes since this time have followed the Tur's arrangement of material.\n** [[Orach Chayim]]: \"The Way of Life\" worship and ritual observance in the home and [[synagogue]], through the course of the day, the weekly sabbath and the festival cycle.\n** [[Yoreh De'ah]]: \"Teach Knowledge\" assorted ritual prohibitions, dietary laws and regulations concerning [[menstruation|menstrual]] impurity.\n** [[Even Ha'ezer]]: \"The Rock of the Helpmate\" [[marriage]], [[divorce]] and other issues in [[family]] law.\n** [[Choshen Mishpat]]: \"The Breastplate of Judgement\" The administration and [[adjudication]] of civil law.\n* The [[Shulchan Aruch|Beit Yosef, and the Shulchan Aruch]] of Rabbi [[Yosef Karo]] (1488\u20131575). The ''Beit Yosef'' is a huge commentary on the ''Tur'' in which Rabbi Karo traces the development of each law from the Talmud through later rabbinical literature (examining thirty-two [[posek|authorities]], beginning with the Talmud and ending with the works of Rabbi [[Israel Isserlein]]). The Shulchan Aruch is, in turn, a condensation of the ''Beit Yosef'' \u2013 stating each ruling simply (literally translated, ''Shulchan Aruch'' means \"set table\"); this work follows the chapter divisions of the Tur. The Shulchan Aruch, together with its related commentaries, is considered by many to be the most authoritative compilation of ''halakha'' since the Talmud. In writing the Shulchan Aruch, Rabbi Karo based his [[posek|rulings]] on three authorities \u2013 Maimonides, Asher ben Jehiel (Rosh), and Isaac Alfasi (Rif); he considered ''the Mordechai'' in inconclusive cases. [[Sephardi|Sephardic Jews]], generally, refer to the Shulchan Aruch as the basis for their daily practice.\n* The works of Rabbi [[Moshe Isserles]] (\"Rema\"; [[Krak\u00f3w]], [[Poland]], 1525 to 1572). Isserles noted that the ''Shulchan Aruch'' was based on the [[Sephardic laws and customs|Sephardic]] tradition, and he created a series of [[gloss (annotation)|glosses]] to be appended to the text of the Shulkhan Aruch for cases where Sephardi and [[Ashkenazi]] [[minhag|customs]] differed (based on the works of [[Yaakov Moelin]], [[Israel Isserlein]], and [[Israel Bruna]]). The glosses are called ''Hamapah'' (\"the Tablecloth\"). His comments are now incorporated into the body of all printed editions of the Shulchan Aruch, typeset in a different script; today, \"Shulchan Aruch\" refers to the combined work of Karo and Isserles. Isserles' ''Darkhei Moshe'' is similarly a commentary on the Tur and the Beit Yosef.\n* The ''Levush Malkhut'' (\"Levush\") of Rabbi [[Mordecai Yoffe]] (c. 1530\u20131612). A ten volume work, five discussing ''halakha'' at a level \"midway between the two extremes: the lengthy Beit Yosef of Karo on the one hand, and on the other Karo's Shulchan Aruch together with the Mappah of Isserles, which is too brief\", that particularly stresses the [[minhag|customs and practices]] of the Jews of Eastern Europe. The Levush was exceptional among the codes, in that it treated certain ''Halakhot'' from a Kabbalistic standpoint.\n* The [[Shulchan Aruch HaRav]] of Rabbi [[Shneur Zalman of Liadi]] (c. 1800) was an attempt to re-codify the law as it stood at that time \u2013 incorporating [[Shulchan Aruch#Major commentaries|commentaries on the Shulchan Aruch]], and [[History of Responsa#Acharonim|subsequent responsa]] \u2013 and thus stating the [[posek|decided ''halakha'']], as well as the underlying reasoning. The work was written partly so that laymen would be able to study Jewish law. Unfortunately, most of the work was lost in a fire prior to publication. It is the basis of practice for [[Chabad-Lubavitch]] and other [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic groups]] and is quoted as authoritative by many subsequent works, Hasidic and non-Hasidic alike.\n* Works structured directly on the Shulchan Aruch, providing analysis in light of [[Acharonim|Acharonic]] material and codes:\n** The [[Mishnah Berurah]] of Rabbi [[Yisrael Meir Kagan|Yisroel Meir ha-Kohen]], (the \"Chofetz Chaim\", Poland, 1838\u20131933) is a commentary on the \"Orach Chayim\" section of the Shulchan Aruch, discussing the application of each ''halakha'' in light of all subsequent [[Acharonim|Acharonic]] decisions. It has become the authoritative halakhic guide for much of [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] Ashkenazic Jewry in the postwar period. \n** [[Aruch HaShulchan]] by Rabbi [[Yechiel Michel Epstein]] (1829\u20131888) is a scholarly analysis of ''halakha'' through the perspective of the major Rishonim. The work follows the structure of the Tur and the Shulchan Aruch; rules dealing with vows, agriculture, and ritual purity, are discussed in a second work known as ''[[Aruch HaShulchan he'Atid]]''. \n** [[Yaakov Chaim Sofer|Kaf HaChaim]] on [[Orach Chayim]] and parts of [[Yoreh De'ah]], by the Sephardi sage [[Yaakov Chaim Sofer]] ([[Baghdad]] and [[Jerusalem]], 1870\u20131939) is similar in scope, authority and approach to the Mishnah Berurah. This work also surveys the views of many kabbalistic sages (particularly [[Isaac Luria]]), when these impact the Halakha.\n** [[Yalkut Yosef]], by Rabbi [[Yitzhak Yosef]], is a voluminous, widely cited and contemporary work of ''halakha'', based on the rulings of Rabbi [[Ovadia Yosef]].\n* [[Layman]]-oriented digests of ''halakha'': \n** The ''[[Kitzur Shulchan Aruch (book)|Kitzur Shulchan Aruch]]'' of Rabbi [[Shlomo Ganzfried]] ([[Hungary]] 1804\u20131886), based on the very strict Hungarian customs of the 19th century, became immensely popular after its publication due to its simplicity. This work is not binding in the same way as the Mishneh Torah or the Shulchan Aruch. It is still popular in [[Orthodox Judaism]] as a framework for study, if not always for practice. \n** [[Chayei Adam]] and [[Chochmat Adam]] by Rabbi  [[Avraham Danzig]] (Poland, 1748\u20131820) are Ashkenazi works regarded as a more appropriate basis for practice.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} \n** The [[Ben Ish Chai]] by [[Ben Ish Hai|Yosef Chaim]] ([[Baghdad]], 1832\u20131909) is a collection of the laws on everyday life interspersed with mystical insights and customs, addressed to the masses and arranged by the weekly [[Torah portion]]. Its wide circulation has seen it become a standard reference work in Sephardi Halakha.\n** [[Eliezer Melamed#Published works|''Peninei Halachah'']] by Rabbi [[Eliezer Melamed]] (15 volumes thus far) covers a wide range of subjects, from Shabbat to organ donations, and in addition to clearly posing the practical law - reflecting the customs of various communities - also discusses the spiritual foundations of the Halakhot.\n* ''Temimei Haderech'' (\"A Guide To Jewish Religious Practice\") by Rabbi [[Isaac Klein]] with contributions from the [[Committee on Jewish Law and Standards]] of the [[Rabbinical Assembly]]. This scholarly work is based on the previous traditional law codes, but written from a [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative Jewish]] point of view, and not accepted among Orthodox Jews.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Judaism|Law}}\n* [[Antinomianism]]\n* [[Baraita of Rabbi Ishmael]]\n* [[Jewish ethics]]\n* [[Jewish medical ethics]]\n* [[Mishpat Ivri]]\n* [[Sharia]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n* [[J.

Halakha is based on biblical commandments (''[[Mitzvah|mitzvot]]''), subsequent [[Talmud]]ic and [[rabbinic law]], and the customs and traditions compiled in the many books such as the ''[[Shulchan Aruch]]''. ''Halakha'' is often translated as \"Jewish Law\", although a more literal translation might be \"the way to behave\" or \"the way of walking\". The word derives from the [[Semitic root|root]] that means \"to behave\" (also \"to go\" or \"to walk\"). ''Halakha'' guides not only religious practices and beliefs, but also numerous aspects of day-to-day life.<ref>[https://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/halakhah-the-laws-of-jewish-life/ \"Halacha: The Laws of Jewish Life.\"] ''My Jewish Learning''. 8 April 2019.</ref>\n\nHistorically, in the [[Jewish diaspora]], ''halakha'' served many Jewish communities as an enforceable avenue of law \u2013 both [[Civil law (legal system)|civil]] and [[religious law|religious]], since no differentiation exists in classical Judaism. Since the Jewish Enlightenment (''[[Haskalah]]'') and [[Jewish emancipation]], some have come to view the ''halakha'' as less binding in day-to-day life, as it relies on rabbinic interpretation, as opposed to the authoritative, canonical text recorded in the [[Hebrew Bible]]. Under contemporary [[Israeli law]], certain areas of Israeli family and personal status law are under the authority of the rabbinic courts, so are treated according to ''halakha''. Some differences in ''halakha'' are found among [[Ashkenazi]], [[Mizrahi]], [[Sephardi]], [[Yemenite Jews|Yemenite]], [[Beta Israel|Ethiopian]] and other Jewish communities who historically lived in isolation.<ref>[https://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/jewish-customs/ \"Jewish Custom (Minhag) Versus Law (Halacha).\"] ''My Jewish Learning''. 8 April 2019.</ref>\n\n== Etymology and terminology ==\n[[File:Talmud set.JPG|thumb|right|upright=1.35|A full set of the Babylonian Talmud]]\nThe word ''halakha'' is derived from the [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] root ''halakh'' \u2013 \"to walk\" or \"to go\".<ref name=\"EncJudaica\">{{cite book |title= Encyclopaedia Judaica |edition= 2 |volume=0 |issue=8 |chapter= Halakhah |first= Louis |last= Jacobs}}</ref>{{rp|252}} Taken literally, therefore, ''halakha'' translates as \"the way to walk\", rather than \"law\". The word ''halakha'' refers to the corpus of rabbinic legal texts, or to the overall system of religious law. The term may also be related to [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]] ''{{lang|akk|ilku}}'', a property tax, rendered in Aramaic as ''{{lang|arc|halakh}}'', designating one or several obligations.<ref name=\"EBR Schiffman\">{{cite encyclopedia |url= https://www.academia.edu/23518527 |title= Halakhah |section= Second Temple and Hellenistic Judaism |first= Lawrence H. |last= Schiffman |encyclopedia= Encyclopedia of the Bible and Its Reception |volume=11 |pages=2\u20138 |publisher= De Gruyter |access-date=10 October 2018}}</ref>\n\n''Halakha'' is often contrasted with ''[[aggadah]]'' (\"the telling\"), the diverse corpus of rabbinic [[Exegesis|exegetical]], narrative, philosophical, mystical, and other \"non-legal\" texts.<ref name=\"EBR Schiffman\"/> At the same time, since writers of ''halakha'' may draw upon the aggadic and even mystical literature, a dynamic interchange occurs between the genres. ''Halakha'' also does not include the parts of the [[Torah]] not related to commandments.\n\n''Halakha'' constitutes the practical application of the [[613 mitzvot|613 ''mitzvot'']] (\"commandments\") in the Torah, as developed through discussion and debate in the classical [[rabbinic literature]], especially the [[Mishnah]] and the [[Talmud]] (the \"[[Oral Torah]]\"), and as codified in the ''[[Mishneh Torah]]'' and ''[[Shulchan Aruch]]''.<ref>[https://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/halakhic-texts-101/ \"Introduction to Halacha, the Jewish Legal Tradition.\"] ''My Jewish Learning''. 8 April 2019.</ref> Because ''halakha'' is developed and applied by various halakhic authorities rather than one sole \"official voice\", different individuals and communities may well have different answers to halakhic questions. With few exceptions, controversies are not settled through authoritative structures because during the [[Jewish diaspora]], Jews lacked a single judicial hierarchy or appellate review process for ''halakha''.\n\n== Commandments (mitzvot) ==\n{{Main|Mitzvah#Mitzvot and Jewish law|613 commandments}}\nAccording to the Talmud (''Tractate Makot''), 613 ''mitzvot'' are in the Torah, 248 positive (\"thou shalt\") ''mitzvot'' and 365 negative (\"thou shalt not\") ''mitzvot'', supplemented by seven ''mitzvot'' [[Mitzvah#Rabbinical mitzvot|legislated by the rabbis]] of antiquity.<ref>Hecht, Mendy.

These laws are composed of the following:\n** The [[Written Torah]], laws written in the [[Hebrew Bible]].\n** The [[Oral Torah]], laws believed to have been transmitted orally prior to their later compilation in texts such as the Mishnah, Talmud, and rabbinic codes.\n* Laws of human origin including rabbinic decrees, interpretations, customs, etc.\n\nThis division between revealed and rabbinic commandments may influence the importance of a rule, its enforcement and the nature of its ongoing interpretation.<ref name=\"Sinclair\" /> Halakhic authorities may disagree on which laws fall into which categories or the circumstances (if any) under which prior rabbinic rulings can be re-examined by contemporary rabbis, but all Halakhic Jews hold that both categories exist and that the first category is immutable, with exceptions only for life-saving and similar emergency circumstances.\n\nA second classical distinction is between the Written Law, laws written in the [[Hebrew Bible]], and the Oral Law, laws which are believed to have been transmitted orally prior to their later compilation in texts such as the Mishnah, Talmud, and rabbinic codes.\n\nCommandments are divided into positive and negative commands, which are treated differently in terms of divine and human punishment. Positive commandments ''require'' an action to be performed and are considered to bring the performer closer to God. Negative commandments (traditionally 365 in number) ''forbid'' a specific action, and violations create a distance from God.\n\nA further division is made between ''chukim'' (\"decrees\" \u2013 laws without obvious explanation, such as ''[[shatnez]]'', the law prohibiting wearing clothing made of mixtures of linen and wool), ''mishpatim'' (\"judgements\" \u2013 laws with obvious social implications) and ''eduyot'' (\"testimonies\" or \"commemorations\", such as the [[Shabbat]] and holidays). Through the ages, various rabbinical authorities have classified some of the 613 commandments in many ways.\n\nA different approach divides the laws into a different set of categories:{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}\n* Laws in relation to God (''bein adam laMakom'', literally, \"between a person and the Place\"), and\n* Laws about relations with other people (''bein adam le-chavero'', literally, \"between a person and his friend\").\n\n== Sources and process ==\n<div class=\"floatright toccolours\" style=\"width:400px; width:calc(200px + 15vw); max-width:100%; box-sizing:border-box\">\n<div style=\"font-weight:bold;text-align:center\">Eras of Jewish law</div>\n* Chazal (literally, \"Our Sages, may their memory be blessed\"): all Jewish sages of the [[Mishna]], [[Tosefta]] and [[Talmud]] eras (c. 250 BCE \u2013 c. 625 CE).\n** The ''[[Zugot]]'' (literally, the \"pairs\"), both the 200-year period (c. 170 BCE \u2013 30 CE, \"Era of the Pairs\") during the Second TemplePeriod in which the spiritual leadership was in the hands of five successions of \"pairs\" of religious teachers, and to each of these pairs themselves.\n** The ''[[Tannaim]]'' (literally, the \"repeaters\") were rabbis living primarily in [[Eretz Yisrael]] who codified the [[Oral Torah]] in the form of the [[Mishnah]]; (0\u2013200 CE).\n** The ''[[Amoraim]]'' (literally, the \"sayers\") lived in both Eretz Yisrael and [[Babylonia]].

Y. Baer (in Zion, 17 (1951\u201352), 1\u201355) has argued that there was little pure academic legal activity at this period and that many of the laws originating at this time were produced by a means of neighbourly good conduct rules in a similar way as carried out by Greeks in the age of Solon. For example, the first chapter of Bava Kamma, contains a formulation of the law of torts worded in the first person.<ref name=\"EncJudaica\" />{{rp|256}}\n\nThe boundaries of Jewish law are determined through the Halakhic process, a religious-ethical system of legal reasoning. Rabbis generally base their opinions on the primary sources of ''halakha'' as well as on precedent set by previous rabbinic opinions. The major sources and genre of ''halakha'' consulted include:\n* The foundational Talmudic literature (especially the [[Mishna]] and the [[Talmud|Babylonian Talmud]]) with commentaries;\n** [[Talmudic hermeneutics]]: the science which defines the rules and methods for the investigation and exact determination of the meaning of the Scriptures; includes also the rules by which the Halakhot are derived from and established by the written law. These may be seen as the rules by which early Jewish law was derived.\n** ''[[Gemara]]'' \u2013 the Talmudic process of elucidating the ''halakha''\n* The post-Talmudic codificatory literature, such as Maimonides's [[Mishneh Torah]] and the [[Shulchan Aruch]] with its commentaries;\n* Regulations and other \"legislative\" enactments promulgated by rabbis and communal bodies:\n** ''[[Gezeirah]]'' (literally, \"declaration\"): \"preventative legislation\" of the rabbis, intended to prevent violations of the [[mitzva|commandments]]\n** ''[[Takkanah]]'' (literally, \"Repair\", meaning also \"Regulation\"): \"positive legislation\", practices instituted by the rabbis not based (directly) on the [[mitzva|commandments]]\n* ''[[Minhag]]'': Customs, community practices, and customary law, as well as the exemplary deeds of prominent (or local) rabbis;\n* The ''[[responsa|she'eloth u-teshuvoth]]'' (responsa, literally, \"questions and answers\") literature.\n* ''[[Dina d'malkhuta dina|Dina d'malchuta dina]]'' (literally, \"the law of the king is law\"): an additional aspect of ''halakha'', being the principle recognizing non-Jewish laws and non-Jewish legal jurisdiction as binding on Jewish citizens, provided that they are not contrary to a law in Judaism. This principle applies primarily in areas of commercial, civil and criminal law.\n\nIn antiquity, the ''[[Sanhedrin]]'' functioned essentially as the Supreme Court and legislature (in the US judicial system) for Judaism, and had the power to administer binding law, including both received law and its own rabbinic decrees, on all Jews\u2014rulings of the Sanhedrin became ''halakha''; see [[Oral law#Oral law in Judaism|Oral law]]. That court ceased to function in its full mode in 40 CE. Today, the authoritative application of Jewish law is left to the local rabbi, and the local rabbinical courts, with only local applicability. In branches of Judaism that follow ''halakha'', lay individuals make numerous ad-hoc decisions, but are regarded as not having authority to decide certain issues definitively.\n\nSince the days of the Sanhedrin, however, no body or authority has been generally regarded as having the authority to create universally recognized precedents. As a result, ''halakha'' has developed in a somewhat different fashion from Anglo-American legal systems with a Supreme Court able to provide universally accepted precedents. Generally, Halakhic arguments are effectively, yet unofficially, peer-reviewed. When a rabbinic ''[[posek]]'' (literally, \"he who makes a statement\", \"decisor\") proposes an additional interpretation of a law, that interpretation may be considered binding for the posek's questioner or immediate community. Depending on the stature of the posek and the quality of the decision, an interpretation may also be gradually accepted by other rabbis and members of other Jewish communities.\n\nUnder this system there is a tension between the relevance of earlier and later authorities in constraining Halakhic interpretation and innovation. On the one hand, there is a principle in ''halakha'' not to overrule a specific law from an earlier era, after it is accepted by the community as a law or [[vow]],<ref>[[Moshe Isserles|Rema]] [[Choshen Mishpat]] Chapter 25</ref> unless supported by another, relevant earlier precedent; see list below. On the other hand, another principle recognizes the responsibility and authority of later authorities, and especially the ''posek'' handling a then-current question. In addition, the ''halakha'' embodies a wide range of principles that permit judicial discretion and deviation (Ben-Menahem).\n\nNotwithstanding the potential for innovation, rabbis and Jewish communities differ greatly on how they make changes in ''halakha''. Notably, ''poskim'' frequently extend the application of a law to new situations, but do not consider such applications as constituting a \"change\" in ''halakha''. For example, many [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] rulings concerning electricity are derived from rulings concerning fire, as closing an electrical circuit may cause a spark. In contrast, Conservative ''poskim'' consider that switching on electrical equipment is physically and chemically more like turning on a water tap (which is permissible by ''halakha'') than lighting a fire (which is not permissible), and therefore permitted on Shabbat. The reformative [[Judaism]] in some cases explicitly interprets ''halakha'' to take into account its view of contemporary society. For instance, most Conservative rabbis extend the application of certain Jewish obligations and permissible activities to women (see [[Halakha#Conservative Judaism|below]]).\n\nWithin certain Jewish communities, formal organized bodies do exist. Within [[Modern Orthodox Judaism]], there is no one committee or leader, but Modern US-based Orthodox rabbis generally agree with the views set by consensus by the leaders of the [[Rabbinical Council of America]]. Within [[Conservative Judaism]], the [[Rabbinical Assembly]] has an official [[Committee on Jewish Law and Standards]].<ref>[https://www.rabbinicalassembly.org/jewish-law/committee-jewish-law-and-standards \"Committee on Jewish Law and Standards.\"] ''The Rabbinical Assembly''. 9 April 2019.</ref>\n\nNote that Takkanot, the plural form of ''Takkanah'' above, in general do not affect or restrict observance of Torah ''mitzvot''. (In common parlance sometimes people use the general term ''takkanah'' to refer either ''gezeirot'' or ''takkanot''.) However, the Talmud states that in exceptional cases, the Sages had the authority to \"uproot matters from the Torah\". In Talmudic and classical Halakhic literature, this authority refers to the authority to prohibit some things that would otherwise be Biblically sanctioned (''shev v'al ta'aseh'', literally, ''thou shall stay seated and not do''). Rabbis may rule that a specific mitzvah from the Torah should not be performed, e. g., blowing the ''[[shofar]]'' on Shabbat, or taking the ''[[Four Species|lulav and etrog]]'' on Shabbat. These examples of takkanot which may be executed out of caution lest some might otherwise carry the mentioned items between home and the synagogue, thus inadvertently violating a Sabbath ''[[Activities prohibited on Shabbat|melakha]]''. Another rare and limited form of takkanah involved overriding Torah prohibitions. In some cases, the Sages allowed the temporary violation of a prohibition in order to maintain the Jewish system as a whole. This was part of the basis for [[Esther]]'s relationship with [[Ahasuerus]] (Xeres). For general usage of takkanaot in Jewish history see the article [[Takkanah]]. For examples of this being used in Conservative Judaism, see [[Conservative halakha]].\n\n=== Historical analysis ===\n{{Eras of the Halakha}}\nThe antiquity of the rules can be determined only by the dates of the authorities who quote them; in general, they cannot safely be declared older than the tanna (from Aramaic, literally, \"repeater\") to whom they are first ascribed. It is certain, however, that the seven middot (literally, \"measurements\", and referring to [good] behavior) of Hillel and the thirteen of Ishmael are earlier than the time of Hillel himself, who was the first to transmit them.\n\nThe Talmud gives no information concerning the origin of the middot, although the Geonim (\"Sages\") regarded them as Sinaitic ([[Law given to Moses at Sinai]]). The Artscroll Series writes in its Overview to the book of Ezra:<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Writings = Kesuvim / The Writings : with a commentary anthologized from Rabbinic writings = Ketuvim : \u02bbim Perush Rashi, Metsudat Da\u1e7fid, Metsudat Tsiyon, \u1e7fe-\u02bbod|others=Scherman, Nosson,, Zlotowitz, Meir|isbn=1422617246|edition= First|location=Brooklyn, N.Y.|oclc=951078375}}</ref>\n\n\"During the Mishnaitic and Talmudic periods, the Sages of Israel... took the eternal tools of exegesis and used them to reveal the secrets that had always been locked within the words of the Torah, secrets that Moses had taught Israel and that, in turn, had been transmitted orally for over a thousand years until the oral tradition began to crumble due to persecution and a lack of diligence. They did nothing new and certainly made no changes in the Torah; they merely made use of hermeneutic principles that had not been need while the tradition of study was still at its study was still at its zenith.\" (pg. xii-xiii)\n\nThe middot seem to have been first laid down as abstract rules by the teachers of Hillel, though they were not immediately recognized by all as valid and binding.  Different schools interpreted and modified them, restricted or expanded them, in various ways. [[Rabbi Akiva]] and [[rabbi Ishmael]] and their scholars especially contributed to the development or establishment of these rules. \"It must be borne in mind, however, that neither Hillel, Ishmael, nor [a contemporary of theirs named] [[Eliezer ben Jose]] sought to give a complete enumeration of the rules of interpretation current in his day, but that they omitted from their collections many rules which were then followed.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/10801-middot-the-seven-of-hillel|title=TALMUD HERMENEUTICS - JewishEncyclopedia.com|website=www.jewishencyclopedia.com|access-date=2019-09-25}}</ref>\n\nAkiva devoted his attention particularly to the grammatical and exegetical rules, while Ishmael developed the logical. The rules laid down by one school were frequently rejected by another because the principles that guided them in their respective formulations were essentially different. According to Akiva, the divine language of the Torah is distinguished from the speech of men by the fact that in the former no word or sound is superfluous.\n\nSome scholars have observed a similarity between these rabbinic rules of interpretation and the hermeneutics of ancient Hellenistic culture. For example, Saul Lieberman argues that the names of rabbi Ishmael's ''middot'' (e. g., ''kal vahomer'', literally, a combination of the archaic form of the word for \"straw\" and the word for \"clay\" \u2013 \"straw and clay\", referring to the obvious [means of making a mud brick]) are Hebrew translations of Greek terms, although the methods of those ''middot'' are not Greek in origin.<ref>{{cite book |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books/?id=0OcaAAAAMAAJ |access-date=10 October 2018 |last=Lieberman |first=Saul |chapter=Rabbinic interpretation of scripture |year=1962 |title=Hellenism in Jewish Palestine |publisher=Jewish Theological Seminary of America |page=47}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books/?id=0OcaAAAAMAAJ |access-date=10 October 2018 |last=Lieberman |first=Saul |chapter=The Hermeneutic Rules of the ''Aggadah'' |year=1962 |title=Hellenism in Jewish Palestine |publisher=Jewish Theological Seminary of America |page=68}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |title=Rabbinic methods of interpretation and Hellenistic rhetoric |first=David |last=Daube |journal=Hebrew Union College Annual |volume=22 |year=1949 |pages=239\u2013264 |jstor=23506588}}</ref>\n\n== Views today ==\n{{multiple image\n| align = right\n| image1 = Midrash22.jpg\n| width1 = 150\n| alt1 = \n| caption1 = \n| image2 = Aaron22.jpg\n| width2 = 141\n| alt2 = \n| caption2 = \n| footer = The artistic freedom spirit of ''Aggadah'' (left, represented by [[Solomon]]) and the legal divine judgment rulings of ''[[Halakhah]] (right, represented by [[Aaron]] and his sons) on the [[Knesset Menorah]]\n}}\n{{See also|Talmud#Present day}}\n[[Orthodox Judaism]] holds that ''halakha'' is the [[divine law]] as laid out in the Torah (five books of Moses), rabbinical laws, rabbinical decrees, and customs combined.

While there are a wide variety of Conservative views, a common belief is that ''halakha'' is, and has always been, an evolving process subject to interpretation by rabbis in every time period. See [[Conservative Judaism#Beliefs|Conservative Judaism, Beliefs]].\n\n[[Reconstructionist Judaism]] holds that halakha is normative and binding, while also believing that it is an evolving concept and that the traditional halakhic system is incapable of producing a code of conduct that is meaningful for, and acceptable to, the vast majority of contemporary Jews. Reconstructionist founder [[Mordecai Kaplan]] believed that \"Jewish life [is] meaningless without Jewish law.\", and one of the planks of the Society for the Jewish Renascence, of which Kaplan was one of the founders, stated: \"We accept the halakha, which is rooted in the Talmud, as the norm of Jewish life, availing ourselves, at the same time, of the method implicit therein to interpret and develop the body of Jewish Law in accordance with the actual conditions and spiritual needs of modern life.\"<ref>{{cite web |title=Reconstructing Halakha |url=https://www.reconstructingjudaism.org/article/reconstructing-halakha |last=Cedarbaum |first=Daniel |agency=Reconstructing Judaism |date=6 May 2016 |access-date=30 January 2020}}</ref>\n\n[[Reform Judaism]] holds that modern views of how the Torah and rabbinic law developed imply that the body of rabbinic Jewish law is no longer normative (seen as binding) on Jews today. Those in the \"traditionalist\" wing believe that the ''halakha'' represents a personal starting-point, holding that each Jew is obligated to interpret the Torah, Talmud and other Jewish works for themselves, and this interpretation will create separate commandments for each person. Those in the liberal and classical wings of Reform believe that in this day and era, most Jewish religious rituals are no longer necessary, and many hold that following most Jewish laws is actually counter-productive. They propose that Judaism has entered a phase of ethical monotheism, and that the laws of Judaism are only remnants of an earlier stage of religious evolution, and need not be followed. This is considered wrong, and even [[heresy|heretical]], by Orthodox and Conservative Judaism.\n\nHumanistic Jews value the Torah as a historical, political, and sociological text written by their ancestors. They do not believe \"that every word of the Torah is true, or even morally correct, just because the Torah is old\". The Torah is both disagreed with and questioned. Humanistic Jews believe that the entire Jewish experience, and not only the Torah, should be studied as a source for Jewish behavior and ethical values.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://oradam.org/OAC/FAQ/ |title=FAQ for Humanistic Judaism, Reform Judaism, Humanists, Humanistic Jews, Congregation, Arizona, AZ |publisher=Oradam.org |access-date=10 October 2018}}</ref>\n\nJews believe that [[gentiles]] are bound by a subset of ''halakha'' called the [[Seven Laws of Noah]], also referred to as the Noahide Laws.

From the very beginnings of Rabbinic Judaism, halakhic inquiry allowed for a \"sense of continuity between past and present, a self-evident trust that their pattern of life and belief now conformed to the sacred patterns and beliefs presented by scripture and tradition\".<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VahYCwAAQBAJ |title=Jews, Christians, Muslims: A Comparative Introduction to Monotheistic Religions |date=2016 |publisher=Routledge |first1=John |last1=Corrigan |first2=Frederick |last2=Denny |first3=Martin S. |last3=Jaffee |first4=Carlos |last4=Eire |isbn=9780205018253 |edition= 2 |access-date=10 October 2018}}</ref> According to an analysis by Jewish scholar Jeffrey Rubenstein of Michael Berger's book ''Rabbinic Authority'', the authority that rabbis hold \"derives not from the institutional or personal authority of the sages but from a ''communal'' decision to recognize that authority, much as a community recognizes a certain judicial system to resolve its disputes and interpret its laws.\"<ref>{{cite journal |last= Rubenstein |first= Jeffrey L. |title= Michael Berger.

The classical approach has permitted new rulings regarding modern technology. For example, some of these rulings guide Jewish observers about the proper use of [[electricity]] on the Sabbath and holidays. Often, as to the applicability of the law in any given situation, the proviso is to \"consult your local rabbi or [[posek]]\". This notion lends rabbis a certain degree of local authority; however, for more complex questions the issue is passed onto higher rabbis who will then issue a ''teshuvot'', which is a ''responsa'' that is binding.<ref>Satlow, Michael, and Daniel Picus. \u201cJudaism, Christianity, and Islam.\u201d Lecture. Providence, Brown University.</ref> Indeed, rabbis will continuously issue different opinions and will constantly review each other's work so as to maintain the truest sense of ''halakha''. Overall, this process allows rabbis to maintain connection of traditional Jewish law to modern life. Of course, the degree of flexibility depends on the sect of Judaism, with Reform being the most flexible, Conservative somewhat in the middle, and Orthodox being much more stringent and rigid. Modern critics, however, have charged that with the rise of movements that challenge the \"divine\" authority of ''halakha'', traditional Jews have greater reluctance to change, not only the laws themselves but also other customs and habits, than traditional Rabbinical Judaism did prior to the advent of Reform in the 19th century.\n\n=== Denominational approaches ===\n==== Orthodox Judaism ====\n[[File:Haredim allant a la synagogue.jpg|thumb|Hasidim walk to the synagogue, [[Rehovot]], [[Israel]].]]\nOrthodox Jews believe that ''halakha'' is a religious system whose core represents the [[Revelation|revealed]] will of God. Although Orthodox Judaism acknowledges that rabbis have made many decisions and decrees regarding Jewish Law where the written Torah itself is nonspecific, they did so only in accordance with regulations received by [[Moses]] on [[Mount Sinai, Egypt|Mount Sinai]] (see {{Bibleref2|Deuteronomy 5:8\u201313}}). These regulations were transmitted orally until shortly after the destruction of the [[Second Temple]]. They were then recorded in the [[Mishnah]], and explained in the Talmud and commentaries throughout history up until the present day. Orthodox Judaism believes that subsequent interpretations have been derived with the utmost accuracy and care. The most widely accepted codes of Jewish law are known as [[Mishneh Torah]] and the [[Shulchan Aruch]].<ref name=\"JillJacobs\">Jacobs, Jill. [https://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/the-shulhan-arukh/ \"The Shulchan Aruch.\"] ''My Jewish Learning''. 8 April 2019.</ref>\n\nOrthodox Judaism has a range of opinions on the circumstances and extent to which change is permissible. [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] Jews generally hold that even ''minhagim'' (customs) must be retained, and existing precedents cannot be reconsidered. [[Modern Orthodox]] authorities are more inclined to permit limited changes in customs and some reconsideration of precedent.<ref>Sokol, Sam.

However, the Torah is still held as mankind's record of its understanding of God's revelation, and thus still has divine authority. Therefore, ''halakha'' is still seen as binding. Conservative Jews use modern methods of historical study to learn how Jewish law has changed over time, and are, in some cases, willing to change Jewish law in the present.<ref>[https://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/halakhah-in-conservative-judaism/ \"Halakhah in Conservative Judaism.\"] ''My Jewish Learning''. 8 April 2019.</ref>\n\nA key practical difference between Conservative and Orthodox approaches is that Conservative Judaism holds that its rabbinical body's powers are not limited to reconsidering later precedents based on earlier sources, but the [[Committee on Jewish Law and Standards]] (CJLS) is empowered to override Biblical and Taanitic prohibitions by ''takkanah'' (decree) when perceived to be inconsistent with modern requirements or views of ethics. The CJLS has used this power on a number of occasions, most famously in the \"driving teshuva\", which says that if someone is unable to walk to any synagogue on the Sabbath, and their commitment to observance is so loose that not attending synagogue may lead them to drop it altogether, their rabbi may give them a dispensation to drive there and back; and more recently in its decision prohibiting the taking of evidence on [[Mamzer]] status on the grounds that implementing such a status is immoral. The CJLS has also held that the Talmudic concept of ''[[Kavod HaBriyot]]'' permits lifting rabbinic decrees (as distinct from carving narrow exceptions) on grounds of human dignity, and used this principle in a December 2006 opinion lifting all rabbinic prohibitions on [[Homosexuality|homosexual]] conduct (the opinion held that only male-male anal sex was forbidden by the [[the Bible and homosexuality|Bible]] and that this remained prohibited). Conservative Judaism also made a number of changes to the [[role of women in Judaism]] including counting women in a [[minyan]],<ref>Fine, David J.

[http://www.cwj.org.il/sites/default/files/Mamzerut%20-%20Spitz.pdf \"Mamzerut.\"] ''Committee on Jewish Law and Standards of the Rabbinical Assembly''. EH 4.2000a. p. 586.</ref> The CJLS adopted the responsum's view that the \"morality which we learn through the larger, unfolding narrative of our tradition\" informs the application of Mosaic law.<ref name=\"KaplanSpitz\" /> The responsum cited several examples of how the rabbinic sages declined to enforce punishments explicitly mandated by Torah law. The examples include the trial of the accused adulteress (''sotah''), the \"law of breaking the neck of the heifer,\" and the application of the death penalty for the \"rebellious child.\"<ref>Kaplan Spitz, p. 577-584.</ref> Kaplan Spitz argues that the punishment of the ''mamzer'' has been effectively inoperative for nearly two thousand years due to deliberate rabbinic inaction. Further he suggested that the rabbis have long regarded the punishment declared by the Torah as immoral, and came to the conclusion that no court should agree to hear testimony on ''mamzerut''.\n\n== Codes of Jewish law ==\nThe most important codifications of Jewish law include:\n* The Mishnah, composed by [[Judah haNasi|rabbi Judah the Prince]], in 200&nbsp;CE, as a basic outline of the state of the Oral Law in his time. This was the framework upon which the Talmud was based; the Talmud's [[dialectic]] analysis of the content of the Mishna (''[[gemara]]''; completed c.&nbsp;500) became the basis for all later [[posek|halakhic decisions]] and subsequent [[codification (law)|codes]].\n* [[Codification (law)|Codification]]s by the [[Geonim]] of the halakhic material in the Talmud. \n** An early work, ''She'iltot'' (\"Questions\") by [[Achai of Shabcha]] (c.&nbsp;752), discusses over 190 ''mitzvot'' \u2013 exploring and addressing various questions on these. \n** The first legal [[codex]] proper, ''Halakhot Pesukot'' (\"Decided Laws\"), by [[Yehudai Gaon]] (c.&nbsp;760), rearranges the Talmud passages in a structure manageable to the layman. (It was written in [[Aramaic language#Jewish Middle Babylonian Aramaic|vernacular Aramaic]], and subsequently translated into [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] as ''Hilkhot Riu''). \n** ''Halakhot Gedolot'' (\"Great Law Book\"), by R.[[Simeon Kayyara]], published two generations later, contains extensive additional material, mainly from [[Responsa]] and [[Monograph]]s of the Geonim, and is presented in a form that is closer to the original Talmud language and structure. (Probably since it was distributed, also, amongst the newly established [[Ashkenazi]] communities.) The ''She'iltot'' was influential on both subsequent works.\n* The [[Hilchot HaRif]], was written by the Rabbi [[Isaac Alfasi]] (1013\u20131103), it has summations of the legal material found in the Talmud. Alfasi transcribed the Talmud's halakhic conclusions verbatim, without the surrounding deliberation; he also excluded all aggadic (non-legal, and homiletic) matter. The ''Hilchot'' soon superseded the geonic codes, as it contained all the decisions and the laws then relevant, and additionally, served as an accessible Talmudic commentary; it has been printed with almost every subsequent edition of the Talmud.\n* The [[Mishneh Torah]] by [[Maimonides]] (1135\u20131204). This work encompasses the full range of Talmudic law; it is organized and reformulated in a logical system \u2013 in 14 books, 83 sections and 1000 chapters \u2013 with each ''halakha'' stated clearly. The Mishneh Torah is very influential to this day, and several later works reproduce passages verbatim. It also includes a section on [[Metaphysics]] and [[Jewish principles of faith|fundamental beliefs]]. (Some claim this section draws heavily on [[Aristotle|Aristotelian]] science and metaphysics; others suggest that it is within the tradition of [[Saadia Gaon]].) It is the main source of practical ''halakha'' for many [[Yemenite Jews]] \u2013 mainly [[Baladi]] and [[Dor Daim]] \u2013 as well as for a growing community referred to as ''[[Dor Daim#Talmide ha-Rambam|talmidei haRambam]]''.\n* The work of ''the Rosh'', rabbi [[Asher ben Jehiel]] (1250?/1259?\u20131328), an abstract of the Talmud, concisely stating the final halakhic decision and quoting later authorities, notably Alfasi, Maimonides, and the [[Tosafists]]. This work superseded rabbi Alfasi's and has been printed with almost every subsequent edition of the Talmud.\n* The ''[[Sefer Mitzvot Gadol]]'' (The \"SeMaG\") of rabbi [[Moses ben Jacob of Coucy]] (first half of the 13th century, [[Coucy-le-Ch\u00e2teau-Auffrique|Coucy]], Northern France). \"SeMaG\" is organised around the 365 negative and the 248 positive commandments, separately discussing each of them according to the Talmud (in light of the commentaries of [[Rashi]] and the [[Tosafot]]) and the other codes existent at the time. ''[[Sefer Mitzvot Katan]]'' (\"SeMaK\") by [[Isaac ben Joseph of Corbeil]] is an abridgement of the ''SeMaG'', including additional practical ''halakha'', as well as agaddic and [[Musar literature|ethical]] material.\n* \"The Mordechai\" \u2013 by [[Mordecai ben Hillel]], d.&nbsp;[[Nuremberg]] 1298 \u2013 serves both as a source of analysis, as well of decided law. Mordechai considered about 350 halakhic authorities, and was widely influential, particularly amongst the Ashkenazi and [[Italian Jews#Italian rite Jews|Italian]] communities. Although organised around the ''Hilchot'' of ''the Rif'', it is, in fact, an independent work. It has been printed with every edition of the Talmud since 1482.\n[[File:Arba'ah Turim.jpg|thumb|200px|An illuminated manuscript of ''Arba'ah Turim'' from 1435.]]\n* The [[Arba'ah Turim]] (''The Tur'', lit. \"The Four Columns\") by rabbi [[Jacob ben Asher]] (1270\u20131343, [[Toledo, Spain]]). This work traces the ''halakha'' from the Torah text and the Talmud through the [[Rishonim]], with the ''Hilchot'' of Alfasi as its starting point. Ben Asher followed Maimonides's precedent in arranging his work in a topical order, however, the Tur covers only those areas of Jewish law that were in force in the author's time. The code is divided into four main sections; almost all codes since this time have followed the Tur's arrangement of material.\n** [[Orach Chayim]]: \"The Way of Life\" worship and ritual observance in the home and [[synagogue]], through the course of the day, the weekly sabbath and the festival cycle.\n** [[Yoreh De'ah]]: \"Teach Knowledge\" assorted ritual prohibitions, dietary laws and regulations concerning [[menstruation|menstrual]] impurity.\n** [[Even Ha'ezer]]: \"The Rock of the Helpmate\" [[marriage]], [[divorce]] and other issues in [[family]] law.\n** [[Choshen Mishpat]]: \"The Breastplate of Judgement\" The administration and [[adjudication]] of civil law.\n* The [[Shulchan Aruch|Beit Yosef, and the Shulchan Aruch]] of rabbi [[Yosef Karo]] (1488\u20131575). The ''Beit Yosef'' is a huge commentary on the ''Tur'' in which rabbi Karo traces the development of each law from the Talmud through later rabbinical literature (examining thirty-two [[posek|authorities]], beginning with the Talmud and ending with the works of rabbi [[Israel Isserlein]]). The Shulchan Aruch is, in turn, a condensation of the ''Beit Yosef'' \u2013 stating each ruling simply (literally translated, ''Shulchan Aruch'' means \"set table\"); this work follows the chapter divisions of the Tur. The Shulchan Aruch, together with its related commentaries, is considered by many to be the most authoritative compilation of ''halakha'' since the Talmud. In writing the Shulchan Aruch, rabbi Karo based his [[posek|rulings]] on three authorities \u2013 Maimonides, Asher ben Jehiel (Rosh), and Isaac Alfasi (Rif); he considered ''the Mordechai'' in inconclusive cases. [[Sephardi|Sephardic Jews]], generally, refer to the Shulchan Aruch as the basis for their daily practice.\n* The works of Rabbi [[Moshe Isserles]] (\"Rema\"; [[Krak\u00f3w]], [[Poland]], 1525 to 1572). Isserles noted that the ''Shulchan Aruch'' was based on the [[Sephardic laws and customs|Sephardic]] tradition, and he created a series of [[gloss (annotation)|glosses]] to be appended to the text of the Shulkhan Aruch for cases where Sephardi and [[Ashkenazi]] [[minhag|customs]] differed (based on the works of [[Yaakov Moelin]], [[Israel Isserlein]], and [[Israel Bruna]]). The glosses are called ''Hamapah'' (\"the Tablecloth\"). His comments are now incorporated into the body of all printed editions of the Shulchan Aruch, typeset in a different script; today, \"Shulchan Aruch\" refers to the combined work of Karo and Isserles. Isserles' ''Darkhei Moshe'' is similarly a commentary on the Tur and the Beit Yosef.\n* The ''Levush Malkhut'' (\"Levush\") of Rabbi [[Mordecai Yoffe]] (c. 1530\u20131612). A ten volume work, five discussing ''halakha'' at a level \"midway between the two extremes: the lengthy Beit Yosef of Karo on the one hand, and on the other Karo's Shulchan Aruch together with the Mappah of Isserles, which is too brief\", that particularly stresses the [[minhag|customs and practices]] of the Jews of Eastern Europe. The Levush was exceptional among the codes, in that it treated certain ''Halakhot'' from a Kabbalistic standpoint.\n* The [[Shulchan Aruch HaRav]] of Rabbi [[Shneur Zalman of Liadi]] (c. 1800) was an attempt to re-codify the law as it stood at that time \u2013 incorporating [[Shulchan Aruch#Major commentaries|commentaries on the Shulchan Aruch]], and [[History of Responsa#Acharonim|subsequent responsa]] \u2013 and thus stating the [[posek|decided ''halakha'']], as well as the underlying reasoning. The work was written partly so that laymen would be able to study Jewish law. Unfortunately, most of the work was lost in a fire prior to publication. It is the basis of practice for [[Chabad-Lubavitch]] and other [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic groups]] and is quoted as authoritative by many subsequent works, Hasidic and non-Hasidic alike.\n* Works structured directly on the Shulchan Aruch, providing analysis in light of [[Acharonim|Acharonic]] material and codes:\n** The [[Mishnah Berurah]] of rabbi [[Yisrael Meir Kagan|Yisroel Meir ha-Kohen]], (the \"Chofetz Chaim\", Poland, 1838\u20131933) is a commentary on the \"Orach Chayim\" section of the Shulchan Aruch, discussing the application of each ''halakha'' in light of all subsequent [[Acharonim|Acharonic]] decisions. It has become the authoritative halakhic guide for much of [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] Ashkenazic Jewry in the postwar period. \n** [[Aruch HaShulchan]] by rabbi [[Yechiel Michel Epstein]] (1829\u20131888) is a scholarly analysis of ''halakha'' through the perspective of the major Rishonim. The work follows the structure of the Tur and the Shulchan Aruch; rules dealing with vows, agriculture, and ritual purity, are discussed in a second work known as ''[[Aruch HaShulchan he'Atid]]''. \n** [[Yaakov Chaim Sofer|Kaf HaChaim]] on [[Orach Chayim]] and parts of [[Yoreh De'ah]], by the Sephardi sage [[Yaakov Chaim Sofer]] ([[Baghdad]] and [[Jerusalem]], 1870\u20131939) is similar in scope, authority and approach to the Mishnah Berurah. This work also surveys the views of many kabbalistic sages (particularly [[Isaac Luria]]), when these impact the Halakha.\n** [[Yalkut Yosef]], by rabbi [[Yitzhak Yosef]], is a voluminous, widely cited and contemporary work of ''halakha'', based on the rulings of rabbi [[Ovadia Yosef]].\n* [[Layman]]-oriented digests of ''halakha'': \n** The ''[[Kitzur Shulchan Aruch (book)|Kitzur Shulchan Aruch]]'' of Rabbi [[Shlomo Ganzfried]] ([[Hungary]] 1804\u20131886), based on the very strict Hungarian customs of the 19th century, became immensely popular after its publication due to its simplicity. This work is not binding in the same way as the Mishneh Torah or the Shulchan Aruch. It is still popular in [[Orthodox Judaism]] as a framework for study, if not always for practice. \n** [[Chayei Adam]] and [[Chochmat Adam]] by [[Avraham Danzig]] (Poland, 1748\u20131820) are Ashkenazi works regarded as a more appropriate basis for practice.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}} \n** The [[Ben Ish Chai]] by [[Ben Ish Hai|Yosef Chaim]] ([[Baghdad]], 1832\u20131909) is a collection of the laws on everyday life interspersed with mystical insights and customs, addressed to the masses and arranged by the weekly [[Torah portion]]. Its wide circulation has seen it become a standard reference work in Sephardi Halakha.\n** [[Eliezer Melamed#Published works|''Peninei Halachah'']] by Rabbi [[Eliezer Melamed]] (15 volumes thus far) covers a wide range of subjects, from Shabbat to organ donations, and in addition to clearly posing the practical law - reflecting the customs of various communities - also discusses the spiritual foundations of the Halakhot.\n* ''Temimei Haderech'' (\"A Guide To Jewish Religious Practice\") by rabbi [[Isaac Klein]] with contributions from the [[Committee on Jewish Law and Standards]] of the [[Rabbinical Assembly]]. This scholarly work is based on the previous traditional law codes, but written from a [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative Jewish]] point of view, and not accepted among Orthodox Jews.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Judaism|Law}}\n* [[Antinomianism]]\n* [[Baraita of Rabbi Ishmael]]\n* [[Jewish ethics]]\n* [[Jewish medical ethics]]\n* [[Mishpat Ivri]]\n* [[Sharia]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n== Bibliography ==\n* [[J.

Though the [[SM-68 Titan|SM-68A]] was operational for only three years, it spawned numerous follow-on models that were a part of the US arsenal and space launch capability. The Titan I was unique among the Titan models in that it used [[liquid oxygen]] and [[RP-1]] as propellants. All subsequent versions used [[storable propellant]]s instead.\n\nOriginally designed as a backup in case Air Force's [[SM-65 Atlas]] missile development ran into problems, the Titan was ultimately beaten into service by Atlas. Deployment went ahead anyway to more rapidly increase the number of missiles on alert and because the Titan's [[missile silo]] basing was more survivable than Atlas.\n\nThe [[LGM-25C Titan II]] would serve in the US [[nuclear deterrent]] until 1987 and had increased capacity and range in addition to the different propellants.\n\n==History==\nBy January 1955, the size of nuclear weapons had been shrinking dramatically, allowing the possibility of building a bomb that could be carried by a missile of reasonable size. The Titan I program began on the recommendation of the [[Teapot Committee|Scientific Advisory Committee]].<ref>Green, Warren E., The Development of the SM-68 Titan, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base: Air Force Systems Command, 1962, AFSC Historical Publications Series 62-23-1, p. vi.</ref> The committee presented to the [[United States Air Force]] (USAF) their findings of the technical feasibility to develop weapons (bombs) and their delivery systems (intercontinental range ballistic missiles) that were completely invulnerable to \"surprise\" attack.\n\nThe reduction in the mass of nuclear warheads allowed full coverage of the entire Sino-Soviet land mass, and the missile control capabilities were also upgraded. The Titan I would be fully independent in controlled flight from launch to the ballistic release of the warhead, which would descend to its target by the combination of gravity and air resistance alone.  In May 1955 the Air Material Command invited contractors to submit proposals and bids for the two stage Titan I ICBM, formally beginning the program. In September 1955, Martin was declared the contractor for the Titan missile. In early October the Air Force's Western Development Division was ordered to start work.<ref>Green, Warren E.,  The Development of the SM-68 Titan, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base: Air Force Systems Command, 1962, AFSC Historical Publications Series 62-23-1, p. vi.</ref> The Titan was developed in parallel with the [[Atlas (missile)|Atlas]] (SM-65/HGM-16) ICBM, serving as a backup with potentially greater capabilities and an incentive for the Atlas contractor to work harder.<ref>Green, Warren E., The Development of the SM-68 Titan, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base: Air Force Systems Command, 1962, AFSC Historical Publications Series 62-23-1, p. 11.</ref>  Martin was selected as the contractor due to its proposed organization<ref>Green, Warren E., The Development of the SM-68 Titan, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base: Air Force Systems Command, 1962, AFSC Historical Publications Series 62-23-1, p. 17.</ref> and method of igniting a liquid fueled engine at high altitude.<ref>Green, Warren E.. The Development of the SM-68 Titan, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base: Air Force Systems Command, 1962, AFSC Historical Publications Series 62-23-1, p. 17.</ref>\n\nThe Titan I was initially designated as a bomber aircraft (B-68),<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.strategic-air-command.com/missiles/Titan/Titan_Missile_Home_Page.htm |title=Titan Missile |publisher=Strategic-Air-Command.com |accessdate=2016-02-06}}</ref> but was later designated [[SM-68 Titan]] and finally HGM-25A in 1962.\n\n===Program management===\nThe previous strategic missile programs of the Air Force had been administered using the \"single prime contractor concept\" (later called the weapon system concept).<ref>Green, Warren E., The Development of the SM-68 Titan, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base: Air Force Systems Command, 1962, AFSC Historical Publications Series 62-23-1, p. 3.</ref> This had resulted in three badly botched programs; the programs of the [[SM-62 Snark|Snark]], [[SM-64 Navaho|Navaho]] and [[GAM-63 RASCAL|RASCAL]] missiles had slipped an average of 5 years and had cost overruns of 300 per cent or more.<ref>Green, Warren E., The Development of the SM-68 Titan, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base: Air Force Systems Command, 1962, AFSC Historical Publications Series 62-23-1, p. 4.</ref> In response, the Teapot Committee was tasked with evaluating requirements for ballistic missiles and methods of accelerating their development. As a result of the ensuing recommendations, the USAF established the Western Development Division and Brigadier General Bernard Schriever was detailed to command it. Schriever devised an entirely new organization for program management. The Air Force was to act as \"prime contractor,\" the Ramo-Woolridge Corporation was contracted to provide systems engineering and technical direction of all ballistic missiles. The airframe contractor also would assemble the sub-systems provided by other Air Force contractors.<ref>Sheehan, Neil 2009, A Fiery Peace in a Cold War Bernard Schriever and the Ultimate Weapon, NewYork: Vintage Books, 2009, pp. 233\u2013234.</ref> At the time, this new organization was very controversial.<ref>Sheehan, Neil 2009, A Fiery Peace in a Cold War Bernard Schriever and the Ultimate Weapon, NewYork: Vintage Books, 2009, pp. 255\u2013257.</ref>\n\nThe Titan I represented an evolution of technology when compared to the Atlas missile program, but shared many of the Atlas' problems. The [[liquid oxygen]] oxidizer could not be stored for long periods of time, increasing the response time as the missile had to be raised out of its silo and loaded with oxidizer before a launch could occur. The main improvements of the Titan I over the first Atlas's deployed were vertical storage in a fully underground silo and an improved fully internal inertial guidance system.  Later [[Atlas E/F]] models were equipped with what would have been the Titan I's guidance system<ref>Green, Warren E., The Development of the SM-68 Titan, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base: Air Force Systems Command, 1962, AFSC Historical Publications Series 62-23-1, p. 23.</ref> The Titan I would be deployed with the [[Bell Labs]] radio-inertial guidance system.<ref>Green, Warren E., The Development of the SM-68 Titan, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base: Air Force Systems Command, 1962, AFSC Historical Publications Series 62-23-1, p. 24</ref><ref>Spirres, David 2012, On Alert  An Operational History of the United States Air Force Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) Program, 1945-2011, Air Force Space Command, United States Air Force, Colorado Springs, Colorado, 2012, p. 97</ref>\n\n===Budgetary problems===\nThe Titan, proposed as a fallback in case the Atlas failed, was by December 1956 accepted by some as a \"principal ingredient of the national ballistic missile force.\"<ref>Green, Warren E., The Development of the SM-68 Titan, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base: Air Force Systems Command, 1962, AFSC Historical Publications Series 62-23-1, p. 36.</ref> At the same time, others pushed for the cancellation of the Titan program almost from the beginning, arguing that it was redundant.<ref>Green, Warren E., The Development of the SM-68 Titan, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base: Air Force Systems Command, 1962, AFSC Historical Publications Series 62-23-1, p. 37.</ref> Counterarguments that the Titan offered greater performance and growth potential than the Atlas as a missile and space launch vehicle,<ref>Green, Warren E., The Development of the SM-68 Titan, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base: Air Force Systems Command, 1962, AFSC Historical Publications Series 62-23-1, p. 37.</ref> the Titan program was under constant budgetary pressure. In the summer of 1957 budget cuts led Secretary of Defense Wilson to reduce the Titan production rate from the proposed seven per month to two a month, which left the Titan as a research and development program only.<ref>Green, Warren E., The Development of the SM-68 Titan, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base: Air Force Systems Command, 1962, AFSC Historical Publications Series 62-23-1, p. 41.</ref> However, the [[Sputnik crisis]], which started 5 October 1957, ended any talk of canceling Titan.

The first successful launch was on 5 February 1959 with Titan I A3, and the last test flight was on 29 January 1962 with Titan I M7. Of the missiles produced, 49 launched and two exploded: six A-types (four launched), seven B-types (two launched), six C-types (five launched), ten G-types (seven launched), 22 J-types (22 launched), four V-types (four launched), and seven M-types (seven launched). Missiles were tested and launched at [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station]] from Launch Complexes [[LC15]], [[LC16]], [[LC19]] and [[LC20]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://afspacemuseum.org/displays/TitanI/ | title=Titan I | author=Air Force Space & Missile Museum | accessdate=11 November 2019 }}</ref><ref>Green, Warren E., The Development of the SM-68 Titan, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base: Air Force Systems Command, 1962, AFSC Historical Publications Series 62-23-1, p. 91.</ref><ref>Cleary, Mark, The 6555th Missile and Space Launches Through 1970, 45th Space Wing History Office, Patrick Air Force Base, Florida, Chapter III Section 6</ref>\n\nThe four A-type missile launches with dummy second stages all occurred in 1959 and were carried out on 6 February, 25 February, 3 April, and 4 May. The guidance system and stage separation all performed well, and aerodynamic drag was lower than anticipated. Titan I was the first program to have a new missile succeed on the initial attempt, which left launch crews unprepared for the series of failures that followed.<ref>Green, Warren E., The Development of the SM-68 Titan, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base: Air Force Systems Command, 1962, AFSC Historical Publications Series 62-23-1, p. 93.</ref>\n\nOn 14 August 1959, the first attempt to fly a Lot B missile with a live stage and dummy warhead ended in disaster. The missile was released 3.9 seconds earlier than intended before it had built up sufficient thrust. One of the umbilicals was prematurely jerked free as the missile lifted, another umbilical sent an automatic cutoff command, and the Titan fell back onto the pad and exploded, causing extensive damage to LC-19. The pad was not used again for six months.<ref>Green, Warren E., The Development of the SM-68 Titan, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base: Air Force Systems Command, 1962, AFSC Historical Publications Series 62-23-1, p. 93.</ref>\n\nOn 12 December 1959, the second attempt to launch a complete Titan (Missile C-2) took place at LC-16. One pad umbilical failed to detach at ignition, and an automatic shutoff signal terminated thrust before the missile could be released by the launcher mechanism. Ground crews quickly repaired the umbilical, and a second launch attempt was made two days later. However, the Titan exploded almost as soon as it was released by the launcher mechanism. The mishap was quickly traced to the Range Safety destruct charges on the first stage inadvertently going off. Martin technicians had moved the activator relay into a vibration-prone area during repair work on the missile, and testing confirmed that the shock from the pad hold-down bolts firing was enough to set off the relay. Because the RSO charges had spilled out the propellants and minimized mixing of them, the explosion was not as powerful as that of Titan B-5, and so damage to LC-16 was less extensive. The pad was repaired in only two months.<ref>Green, Warren E., The Development of the SM-68 Titan, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base: Air Force Systems Command, 1962, AFSC Historical Publications Series 62-23-1, p. 94.</ref>\n\nOn 2 February 1960, LC-19 returned to action as Missile B-7 marked the first successful flight of a Titan with a live upper stage. On 5 February, LC-16 returned to action by hosting Missile C-4. The second attempt at a Lot C Titan failed at T+52 seconds when the guidance compartment collapsed, causing the RVX-3 reentry vehicle to separate.<ref>Green, Warren E., The Development of the SM-68 Titan, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base: Air Force Systems Command, 1962, AFSC Historical Publications Series 62-23-1, p. 94.</ref> The missile pitched down and the first stage LOX tank ruptured from aerodynamic loads, blowing the stage to pieces. After the first stage destroyed itself, the second stage separated and began engine ignition, sensing that normal staging had taken place. With no attitude control, it began tumbling end-over-end and quickly lost thrust. The stage plummeted into the Atlantic Ocean some 30\u201340 miles downrange. After the successful flight of Missile G-4 on 24 February, Missile C-1's second stage failed to ignite on 8 March due to a stuck valve preventing the gas generator from starting.<ref>Green, Warren E., The Development of the SM-68 Titan, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base: Air Force Systems Command, 1962, AFSC Historical Publications Series 62-23-1, p. 95.</ref> On 1 July, the newly opened LC-20 hosted its first launch when Missile J-2, an operational prototype, was flown. Unfortunately, a broken hydraulic line caused the Titan's engines to gimbal hard left almost as soon as the tower was cleared.<ref>Green, Warren E., The Development of the SM-68 Titan, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base: Air Force Systems Command, 1962, AFSC Historical Publications Series 62-23-1, p. 96.</ref> The missile pitched over and flew onto a near-horizontal plane when Range Safety sent the destruct command at T+11 seconds. The burning remains of the Titan impacted 300 meters from the pad in an enormous fireball. The piece of plumbing responsible for the missile failure was retrieved\u2014it had popped out of its sleeve resulting in loss of first stage hydraulic pressure. The sleeve was not tight enough to hold the hydraulic line in place, and the pressure being imparted into it at liftoff was enough to pop it loose. Examination of other Titan missiles found more defective hydraulic lines, and the Missile J-2 debacle caused a wholesale review of manufacturing processes and improved parts testing.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://archive.org/stream/NASA_NTRS_Archive_19730015128/NASA_NTRS_Archive_19730015128_djvu.txt | title=NASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS) 19730015128: Long life assurance study for manned spacecraft long life hardware.

Cause of the failure was a LOX valve closing prematurely, which resulted in the rupture of a propellant duct and thrust termination. Missile J-6 on 24 October set a record by flying 6100 miles. The J series resulted in minor changes to alleviate the second stage shutting down prematurely or failing to ignite.<ref>Green, Warren E., The Development of the SM-68 Titan, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base: Air Force Systems Command, 1962, AFSC Historical Publications Series 62-23-1, p. 96.</ref>\n\nThe string of failures during 1959\u201360 led to complaints from the Air Force that Martin\u2013Marietta weren't taking the Titan project seriously (since it was just a backup to the primary Atlas ICBM program) and displayed an indifferent, careless attitude that resulted in easily avoidable failure modes such as Missile C-3's range safety command destruct system relays being placed in a vibration-prone area.<ref>Green, Warren E., The Development of the SM-68 Titan, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base: Air Force Systems Command, 1962, AFSC Historical Publications Series 62-23-1, p. 94.</ref><ref>Green, Warren E., The Development of the SM-68 Titan, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base: Air Force Systems Command, 1962, AFSC Historical Publications Series 62-23-1, p. 128.</ref>\n\nIn December, Missile V-2 was undergoing a flight readiness test in a silo at [[Vandenberg Air Force Base]]. The plan was to load the missile with propellant, raise it up to firing position, and then lower it back into the silo. Unfortunately, the silo elevator collapsed, causing the Titan to fall back down and explode. The blast was so violent that it ejected a service tower from inside the silo and launched it some distance into the air before coming back down.<ref>Stumpf, David K., Titan II, p 22-26, The University of Arkansas Press, Fayetteville, Arkansas, 2000 {{ISBN|1-55728-601-9}}</ref><ref name=\"See, Earl 2014, p. 118\">See, Earl , Titan Missile Memoirs, Huntington Beach, California: American Aviation Historical Society Journal, Summer 2014, p. 118.</ref><ref>Marsh, Lt.

On 20 January 1961, Missile AJ-10 launched from LC-19 at CCAS. The flight ended in failure when an improper disconnect of a pad umbilical caused an electrical short in the second stage. The Titan performed well through the first stage burn, but after second stage separation, the fuel valve to the gas generator failed to open, preventing engine start. Missiles AJ-12 and AJ-15 in March were lost due to turbopump problems. Missile M-1's second stage lost thrust when the hydraulic pump failed. Missile SM-2 experienced early first stage shutdown; although the second stage burn was successful, it had to run to propellant depletion instead of a timed cutoff. The added stress of this operation apparently resulted in a failure of either the gas generator or turbopump, as the vernier solo phase ended prematurely. Missile M-6's second stage failed to start when an electrical relay malfunctioned and reset the ignition timer.<ref>Cleary, Mark, The 6555th Missile and Space Launches Through 1970, 45th Space Wing History Office, Patrick Air Force Base, Florida, Chapter III Section 6</ref><ref>Stumpf, David K., Titan II, p 276, The University of Arkansas Press, Fayetteville, Arkansas, 2000 {{ISBN|1-55728-601-9}}</ref>\n\nWith attention shifting to the Titan II, there were only six Titan I flights during 1962, with one failure, when Missile SM-4 (21 January) experienced an electrical short in the second stage hydraulic actuator, which gimbaled hard left at T+98 seconds. Staging was performed successfully, but the second stage engine failed to start.<ref>Stumpf, David K., Titan II, p 276, The University of Arkansas Press, Fayetteville, Arkansas, 2000 {{ISBN|1-55728-601-9}}</ref>\n\nTwelve more Titan Is were flown in 1963\u201365, with the finale being Missile SM-33, flown on 5 March 1965. The only total failure in this last stretch of flights was when Missile V-4 (1 May 1963) suffered a stuck gas generator valve and loss of engine thrust at liftoff. The Titan fell over and exploded on impact with the ground.<ref>http://www.chromehooves.net/documents/martin/titan_i_firing_history/01_-_titan_i_firing_history_ocr.pdf</ref><ref>Stumpf, David K., Titan II, p 277, The University of Arkansas Press, Fayetteville, Arkansas, 2000 {{ISBN|1-55728-601-9}}</ref>\n\nAlthough most of the Titan I's teething problems were worked out by 1961, the missile was already eclipsed not only by the Atlas, but by its own design successor, the Titan II, a bigger, more powerful ICBM with storable [[hypergolic propellant]]s. The launch pads at Cape Canaveral were quickly converted for the new vehicle. Vandenberg Launch Complex 395 continued to provide for operational test launches. The last Titan I launch was from  LC 395A  silo A-2 in March 1965.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.afspacemuseum.org/vandenberg/395A/ | title=Complex 395A | author=Air Force Space & Missile Museum | accessdate=11 November 2019 }}</ref> After a brief period as an operational ICBM, it was retired from service in 1965 when Defense Secretary [[Robert McNamara]] made the decision to phase out all first generation cryogenically-fueled missiles in favor of newer hypergolic and solid-fueled models. While decommissioned Atlas (and later Titan II) missiles were recycled and utilized for space launches, the Titan I inventory were stored and eventually  scrapped..<ref>Clemmer,  Wilbur E..1966, Phase-Out of the Atlas E and F and Titan I Weapon Systems, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base: Historical Research Division Air Force Logistics Command, 1966, p. 22-23.</ref>\n\n==Characteristics==\nProduced by the [[Glenn L. Martin Company]] (which became \"The Martin Company\" in 1957), Titan I was a two-stage, liquid-fueled [[ballistic missile]] with an effective range of 6,101 nautical miles (11,300&nbsp;km). The first stage delivered 300,000 pounds (1,330&nbsp;kN) of thrust, the second stage 80,000 pounds (356&nbsp;kN). The fact that Titan I, like Atlas, burned Rocket Propellant 1 ([[RP-1]]) and liquid oxygen ([[LOX]]) meant that the [[oxidizer]] had to be loaded onto the missile just before launch from an underground storage tank, and the missile raised above ground on the enormous elevator system, exposing the missile for some time before launch.  The complexity of the system combined with its relatively slow reaction time \u2013 fifteen minutes to load, followed by the time required to raise and launch the first missile.<ref>United States Air Force, The T.O. 21M-HGM25A-1-1 Technical Manual Operation and Organizational Maintenance HGM-25A Missile Weapon System, United States Air Force, 1964, paragraph 1-159 - 6-1 - 6-4 </ref> Following the launch of the first missile the other two could reportedly be fired at 7-1/2 minute intervals.<ref>Hoselton, Gary A., Titan I Guidance System, Brekenridge, Colorado: Association of Air Force Missileers, Volume 6, Number 1, March, 1998, p. 4.</ref> Titan I utilized radio-inertial command guidance.

The Atlas missile had all three of its main rocket engines ignited at launch (two were jettisoned during flight) due to concerns about igniting rocket engines at high altitude and maintaining combustion stability.<ref>Walker,Chuck, Atlas The Ultimate Weapon, Burlington Canada: Apogee Books, 2005, {{ISBN|0-517-56904-3}}, p. 11</ref> Martin, in part, was selected as the contractor because it had \"recognized the 'magnitude of the altitude start problem' for the second stage and had a good suggestion for solving it.\"<ref>Green, Warren E., The Development of the SM-68 Titan, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base: Air Force Systems Command, 1962, AFSC Historical Publications Series 62-23-1, p. 17.</ref> Titan I's second-stage engines were reliable enough to be ignited at altitude, after separation from the first stage booster. The first stage, besides including heavy fuel tanks and engines, also had launch interface equipment and the launch pad thrust ring with it.  When the first stage had finished consuming its propellant, it dropped away, thereby decreasing the mass of the vehicle.  Titan I's ability to jettison this mass prior to the ignition of the second stage meant that Titan I had a much greater total range (and a greater range per pound of second-stage fuel) than Atlas, even if the total fuel load of Atlas had been greater.<ref>Widnal Perair S., Lecture L14 - Variable Mass Systems The: Rocket Equation, 2008, MIT OpenCourseWar</ref> As North American Aviation's [[Rocketdyne]] Division was the only manufacturer of large liquid propellent rocket engines the Air Force Western Development Division decided to develop a second source for them.

I encompassed all of the equipment and even the bases for the Titan I strategic missile. The Titan I was first American ICBM designed to be based in underground silos, and it gave USAF managers, contractors and missile crews valuable experience building and working in vast complexes containing everything the missiles and crews needed for operation and survival. The complexes were composed of an entry portal, control center, powerhouse, terminal room, two antenna silos for the [[ATHENA computer|ATHENA]] guidance radar antennas, and three launchers each composed of: three equipment terminals, three propellant terminals, and three missile silos. All connected by an extensive network of tunnels.<ref>United States Air Force, The T.O. 21M-HGM25A-1-1 Technical Manual Operation and Organizational Maintenance HGM-25A Missile Weapon System, United States Air Force, 1964, Pg 1-9</ref> Both antenna terminals and all three launchers were isolated with double door blast locks the doors of which could not be open at the same time. This was to ensure that if there was an explosion in a missile launcher or the site was under attack, only the exposed antenna and/or missile silo would be damaged.<ref>United States Air Force, The T.O. 21M-HGM25A-1-1 Technical Manual Operation and Organizational Maintenance HGM-25A Missile Weapon System, United States Air Force, 1964, Pg 1-52</ref>\n\nThe launch crew was composed of a missile combat crew commander, missile launch officer (MLO), guidance electronics officer (GEO), ballistic missile analyst technician (BMAT), and two electrical power production technicians (EPPT).<ref>United States Air Force, The T.O. 21M-HGM25A-1-1 Technical Manual Operation and Organizational Maintenance HGM-25A Missile Weapon System, United States Air Force, 1964, Pg 7-1 - 7-3</ref> There were also a cook and two Air Police.<ref>Simpson, Charles G, The Titan I part 2, Breckenridge, Colorado: Association of Air Force Missileers, October 1993, p. 5.</ref> During normal duty hours there was a site commander, site maintenance officer, site chief, job controller/expediter, tool crib operator, power house chief, three pad chiefs, three assistant pad chiefs, another cook and more air police. There could be a number of electricians, plumbers, power production technicians, air conditioning technicians, and other specialist when maintenance was being performed.<ref>Simpson, Charles G, The Titan I part 2, Breckenridge, Colorado: Association of Air Force Missileers, October 1993, p. 5.</ref>\n\nThese early complexes while safe from a nearby nuclear detonation, however, had certain drawbacks. First, the missiles took about 15 minutes to fuel, and then, one at a time, had to be lifted to the surface on elevators for launching and guidance, which slowed their reaction time. Rapid launching was crucial to avoid possible destruction by incoming missiles. Even though Titan complexes were designed to withstand nearby nuclear blasts antenna and missile extended for launch and guidance were quite susceptible to even a relatively distant miss.<ref>United States Air Force, The T.O. 21M-HGM25A-1-1 Technical Manual Operation and Organizational Maintenance HGM-25A Missile Weapon System, United States Air Force, 1964, page 6-1</ref> The missiles sites of a squadron were placed at least 17 (usually 20 to 30) miles apart so that a single nuclear weapon could not take out two sites.<ref>Green  Warren E..1962, The Development of the SM-68 Titan, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base: Air Force Systems Command, 1962, AFSC Historical Publications Series 62-23-1, p. 85.</ref> The sites also had to be close enough that if a sites guidance system failed it could \"handover\" its missiles to another site of the squadron.<ref>Hoselton, Gary A., Titan I Guidance System, Brekenridge, Colorado: Association of Air Force Missileers, Volume 6, Number 1998, p. 6.</ref><ref>United States Air Force, The T.O. 21M-HGM25A-1-1 Technical Manual Operation and Organizational Maintenance HGM-25A Missile Weapon System, United States Air Force, 1964, page 3-100</ref>\n\nThe distance between the antenna silos and the most distant missile silo was between 1,000 and {{convert|1300|ft|m}}. These were by far the most complex, extensive and expensive missile launch facilities ever deployed by the USAF.<ref>Simpson, Charles G, The Titan I part 1, Breckenridge, Colorado: Association of Air Force Missileers, July 1993, p. 3.</ref><ref>Green  Warren E., 1962, The Development of the SM-68 Titan, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base: Air Force Systems Command, 1962, AFSC Historical Publications Series 62-23-1, p. 77.</ref><ref>Kaplan, Albert B. and Keyes, Lt.

Before each launch the guidance radar, which was periodically calibrated by acquiring a special target at a precisely known range and bearing,<ref>Hoselton, Gary A., Titan I Guidance System, Brekenridge, Colorado: Association of Air Force Missileers, Volume 6, Number 1, March 1998, p. 7.</ref> had to acquire a radio on the missile (missile guidance set AN/DRW-18, AN/DRW-19, AN/DRW-20, AN/DRW-21, or AN/DRW-22).<ref>Hoselton, Gary A., Titan I Guidance System, Brekenridge, Colorado: Association of Air Force Missileers, Volume 6, Number 1, March 1998, p. 5.</ref><ref>United States Air Force, The T.O. 21M-HGM25A-1-1 Technical Manual Operation and Organizational Maintenance HGM-25A Missile Weapon System, United States Air Force, 1964, paragraph 1-159</ref> When the missile was launched, the guidance radar tracked the missile and supplied precise velocity range and azimuth data to the guidance computer which then generated guidance corrections which were transmitted to the missile. Because of this the complex could only launch and track one missile at a time though another could be elevated while the first was being guided.\n\n===Retirement===\nWhen the storable-fueled [[LGM-25C Titan II|Titan II]] and the solid-fueled [[Minuteman missile|Minuteman I]] were deployed in 1963, the Titan I and Atlas missiles became obsolete. They were retired from service as ICBMs in early 1965.<ref>On Alert  An Operational History of the United States Air Force Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) Program, 1945-2011, Spires, David, p 147, Air Force Space Command, United States Air Force, Colorado Springs, Colorado 2012 </ref><ref>Stumpf, David K., Titan II, p 31, The University of Arkansas Press, Fayetteville, Arkansas, 2000 {{ISBN|1-55728-601-9}} United States Cold War Missile Program,U.S. Army Construction Engineering Research Laboratories, Champaign, IL., page 137</ref>\n\nThe final launch from [[Vandenberg Air Force Base]] (VAFB) occurred on 5 March 1965.

It did not make economic sense to refurbish them as SM-65 Atlas missiles with similar payload capacities had already been converted to satellite launchers. About 33 were distributed to museums, parks and schools as static displays (see list below).  The remaining 50 missiles were scrapped at Mira Loma AFS near San Bernardino, CA; the last was broken up in 1972, in accordance with the SALT-I Treaty of 1 February 1972.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.militarymuseum.org/MiraLomaQMD.html |title=Mira Loma Quartermaster.

By 6 May 1966 the Air Force wanted to retain 5 Titan sites and the General Services Administration had earmarked 1 for possible use. The USAF removed equipment it had uses for, the rest was offered to other government agencies.<ref>Clemmer,  Wilbur E..1966, Phase-Out of the Atlas E and F and Titan I Weapon Systems, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base: Historical Research Division Air Force Logistics Command, 1962, p. 31.</ref> Eventually no sites were retained and all were salvaged. The chosen method was the Service and Salvage contract, which required the contractor to remove the equipment the government wanted before proceeding with scrapping.<ref>Clemmer,  Wilbur E..1966, Phase-Out of the Atlas E and F and Titan I Weapon Systems, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base: Historical Research Division Air Force Logistics Command, 1962, p. 49.</ref> This accounts for the varied degree of salvage at the sites today.

Though the [[SM-68 Titan|SM-68A]] was operational for only three years, it spawned numerous follow-on models that were a part of the US arsenal and space launch capability. The Titan I was unique among the Titan models in that it used [[liquid oxygen]] and [[RP-1]] as propellants. All subsequent versions used [[storable propellant]]s instead.\n\nOriginally designed as a backup in case Air Force's [[SM-65 Atlas]] missile development ran into problems, the Titan was ultimately beaten into service by Atlas. Deployment went ahead anyway to more rapidly increase the number of missiles on alert and because the Titan's [[missile silo]] basing was more survivable than Atlas.\n\nThe [[LGM-25C Titan II]] would serve in the US [[nuclear deterrent]] until 1987 and had increased capacity and range in addition to the different propellants.\n\n==History==\nBy January 1955, the size of nuclear weapons had been shrinking dramatically, allowing the possibility of building a bomb that could be carried by a missile of reasonable size. The Titan I program began on the recommendation of the [[Teapot Committee|Scientific Advisory Committee]].<ref>Green, Warren E., The Development of the SM-68 Titan, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base: Air Force Systems Command, 1962, AFSC Historical Publications Series 62-23-1, p. vi.</ref> The committee presented to the [[United States Air Force]] (USAF) their findings of the technical feasibility to develop weapons (bombs) and their delivery systems (intercontinental range ballistic missiles) that were completely invulnerable to \"surprise\" attack.\n\nThe reduction in the mass of nuclear warheads allowed full coverage of the entire Sino-Soviet land mass, and the missile control capabilities were also upgraded. The Titan I would be fully independent in controlled flight from launch to the ballistic release of the warhead, which would descend to its target by the combination of gravity and air resistance alone.  In May 1955 the Air Material Command invited contractors to submit proposals and bids for the two stage Titan I ICBM, formally beginning the program. In September 1955, Martin was declared the contractor for the Titan missile. In early October the Air Force's Western Development Division was ordered to start work.<ref>Green, Warren E.,  The Development of the SM-68 Titan, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base: Air Force Systems Command, 1962, AFSC Historical Publications Series 62-23-1, p. vi.</ref> The Titan was developed in parallel with the [[Atlas (missile)|Atlas]] (SM-65/HGM-16) ICBM, serving as a backup with potentially greater capabilities and an incentive for the Atlas contractor to work harder.<ref>Green, Warren E., The Development of the SM-68 Titan, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base: Air Force Systems Command, 1962, AFSC Historical Publications Series 62-23-1, p. 11.</ref>  Martin was selected as the contractor due to its proposed organization<ref>Green, Warren E., The Development of the SM-68 Titan, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base: Air Force Systems Command, 1962, AFSC Historical Publications Series 62-23-1, p. 17.</ref> and method of igniting a liquid fueled engine at high altitude.<ref>Green, Warren E..

As a result of the ensuing recommendations, the USAF established the Western Development Division and Brigadier General Bernard Schriever was detailed to command it. Schriever devised an entirely new organization for program management. The Air Force was to act as \"prime contractor,\" the Ramo-Woolridge Corporation was contracted to provide systems engineering and technical direction of all ballistic missiles. The airframe contractor also would assemble the sub-systems provided by other Air Force contractors.<ref>Sheehan, Neil 2009, A Fiery Peace in a Cold War Bernard Schriever and the Ultimate Weapon, NewYork: Vintage Books, 2009, pp. 233\u2013234.</ref> At the time, this new organization was very controversial.<ref>Sheehan, Neil 2009, A Fiery Peace in a Cold War Bernard Schriever and the Ultimate Weapon, NewYork: Vintage Books, 2009, pp. 255\u2013257.</ref>\n\nThe Titan I represented an evolution of technology when compared to the Atlas missile program, but shared many of the Atlas' problems. The [[liquid oxygen]] oxidizer could not be stored for long periods of time, increasing the response time as the missile had to be raised out of its silo and loaded with oxidizer before a launch could occur. The main improvements of the Titan I over the first Atlas\u2019s deployed were vertical storage in a fully underground silo and an improved fully internal inertial guidance system.  Later [[Atlas E/F]] models were equipped with what would have been the Titan I's guidance system<ref>Green, Warren E., The Development of the SM-68 Titan, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base: Air Force Systems Command, 1962, AFSC Historical Publications Series 62-23-1, p. 23.</ref> The Titan I would be deployed with the [[Bell Labs]] radio-inertial guidance system.<ref>Green, Warren E., The Development of the SM-68 Titan, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base: Air Force Systems Command, 1962, AFSC Historical Publications Series 62-23-1, p. 24</ref><ref>Spirres, David 2012, On Alert  An Operational History of the United States Air Force Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) Program, 1945-2011, Air Force Space Command, United States Air Force, Colorado Springs, Colorado, 2012, p. 97</ref>\n\n===Budgetary problems===\nThe Titan, proposed as a fallback in case the Atlas failed, was by December 1956 accepted by some as a \"principal ingredient of the national ballistic missile force.\"<ref>Green, Warren E., The Development of the SM-68 Titan, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base: Air Force Systems Command, 1962, AFSC Historical Publications Series 62-23-1, p. 36.</ref> At the same time, others pushed for the cancellation of the Titan program almost from the beginning, arguing that it was redundant.<ref>Green, Warren E., The Development of the SM-68 Titan, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base: Air Force Systems Command, 1962, AFSC Historical Publications Series 62-23-1, p. 37.</ref> Counterarguments that the Titan offered greater performance and growth potential than the Atlas as a missile and space launch vehicle,<ref>Green, Warren E., The Development of the SM-68 Titan, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base: Air Force Systems Command, 1962, AFSC Historical Publications Series 62-23-1, p. 37.</ref> the Titan program was under constant budgetary pressure. In the summer of 1957 budget cuts led Secretary of Defense Wilson to reduce the Titan production rate from the proposed seven per month to two a month, which left the Titan as a research and development program only.<ref>Green, Warren E., The Development of the SM-68 Titan, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base: Air Force Systems Command, 1962, AFSC Historical Publications Series 62-23-1, p. 41.</ref> However, the [[Sputnik crisis]], which started 5 October 1957, ended any talk of canceling Titan.

The first successful launch was on 5 February 1959 with Titan I A3, and the last test flight was on 29 January 1962 with Titan I M7. Of the missiles produced, 49 launched and two exploded: six A-types (four launched), seven B-types (two launched), six C-types (five launched), ten G-types (seven launched), 22 J-types (22 launched), four V-types (four launched), and seven M-types (seven launched). Missiles were tested and launched at [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station]] from Launch Complexes [[LC15]], [[LC16]], [[LC19]] and [[LC20]].<ref>{{cite web | url=http://afspacemuseum.org/displays/TitanI/ | title=Titan I | author=Air Force Space & Missile Museum | accessdate=11 November 2019 }}</ref><ref>Green, Warren E., The Development of the SM-68 Titan, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base: Air Force Systems Command, 1962, AFSC Historical Publications Series 62-23-1, p. 91.</ref><ref>Cleary, Mark, The 6555th Missile and Space Launches Through 1970, 45th Space Wing History Office, Patrick Air Force Base, Florida, Chapter III Section 6</ref>\n\nThe four A-type missile launches with dummy second stages all occurred in 1959 and were carried out on 6 February, 25 February, 3 April, and 4 May. The guidance system and stage separation all performed well, and aerodynamic drag was lower than anticipated. Titan I was the first program to have a new missile succeed on the initial attempt, which left launch crews unprepared for the series of failures that followed.<ref>Green, Warren E., The Development of the SM-68 Titan, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base: Air Force Systems Command, 1962, AFSC Historical Publications Series 62-23-1, p. 93.</ref>\n\nOn 14 August 1959, the first attempt to fly a Lot B missile with a live stage and dummy warhead ended in disaster. The missile was released 3.9 seconds earlier than intended before it had built up sufficient thrust. One of the umbilicals was prematurely jerked free as the missile lifted, another umbilical sent an automatic cutoff command, and the Titan fell back onto the pad and exploded, causing extensive damage to LC-19. The pad was not used again for six months.<ref>Green, Warren E., The Development of the SM-68 Titan, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base: Air Force Systems Command, 1962, AFSC Historical Publications Series 62-23-1, p. 93.</ref>\n\nOn 12 December 1959, the second attempt to launch a complete Titan (Missile C-2) took place at LC-16. One pad umbilical failed to detach at ignition, and an automatic shutoff signal terminated thrust before the missile could be released by the launcher mechanism. Ground crews quickly repaired the umbilical, and a second launch attempt was made two days later. However, the Titan exploded almost as soon as it was released by the launcher mechanism. The mishap was quickly traced to the Range Safety destruct charges on the first stage inadvertently going off. Martin technicians had moved the activator relay into a vibration-prone area during repair work on the missile, and testing confirmed that the shock from the pad hold-down bolts firing was enough to set off the relay. Because the RSO charges had spilled out the propellants and minimized mixing of them, the explosion was not as powerful as that of Titan B-5, and so damage to LC-16 was less extensive. The pad was repaired in only two months.<ref>Green, Warren E., The Development of the SM-68 Titan, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base: Air Force Systems Command, 1962, AFSC Historical Publications Series 62-23-1, p. 94.</ref>\n\nOn 2 February 1960, LC-19 returned to action as Missile B-7 marked the first successful flight of a Titan with a live upper stage. On 5 February, LC-16 returned to action by hosting Missile C-4. The second attempt at a Lot C Titan failed at T+52 seconds when the guidance compartment collapsed, causing the RVX-3 reentry vehicle to separate.<ref>Green, Warren E., The Development of the SM-68 Titan, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base: Air Force Systems Command, 1962, AFSC Historical Publications Series 62-23-1, p. 94.</ref> The missile pitched down and the first stage LOX tank ruptured from aerodynamic loads, blowing the stage to pieces. After the first stage destroyed itself, the second stage separated and began engine ignition, sensing that normal staging had taken place. With no attitude control, it began tumbling end-over-end and quickly lost thrust. The stage plummeted into the Atlantic Ocean some 30\u201340 miles downrange. After the successful flight of Missile G-4 on 24 February, Missile C-1's second stage failed to ignite on 8 March due to a stuck valve preventing the gas generator from starting.<ref>Green, Warren E., The Development of the SM-68 Titan, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base: Air Force Systems Command, 1962, AFSC Historical Publications Series 62-23-1, p. 95.</ref> On 1 July, the newly opened LC-20 hosted its first launch when Missile J-2, an operational prototype, was flown. Unfortunately, a broken hydraulic line caused the Titan's engines to gimbal hard left almost as soon as the tower was cleared.<ref>Green, Warren E., The Development of the SM-68 Titan, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base: Air Force Systems Command, 1962, AFSC Historical Publications Series 62-23-1, p. 96.</ref> The missile pitched over and flew onto a near-horizontal plane when Range Safety sent the destruct command at T+11 seconds. The burning remains of the Titan impacted 300 meters from the pad in an enormous fireball. The piece of plumbing responsible for the missile failure was retrieved\u2014it had popped out of its sleeve resulting in loss of first stage hydraulic pressure. The sleeve was not tight enough to hold the hydraulic line in place, and the pressure being imparted into it at liftoff was enough to pop it loose. Examination of other Titan missiles found more defective hydraulic lines, and the Missile J-2 debacle caused a wholesale review of manufacturing processes and improved parts testing.<ref>{{cite web | url=https://archive.org/stream/NASA_NTRS_Archive_19730015128/NASA_NTRS_Archive_19730015128_djvu.txt | title=NASA Technical Reports Server (NTRS) 19730015128: Long life assurance study for manned spacecraft long life hardware.

Cause of the failure was a LOX valve closing prematurely, which resulted in the rupture of a propellant duct and thrust termination. Missile J-6 on 24 October set a record by flying 6100 miles. The J series resulted in minor changes to alleviate the second stage shutting down prematurely or failing to ignite.<ref>Green, Warren E., The Development of the SM-68 Titan, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base: Air Force Systems Command, 1962, AFSC Historical Publications Series 62-23-1, p. 96.</ref>\n\nThe string of failures during 1959\u201360 led to complaints from the Air Force that Martin\u2013Marietta weren't taking the Titan project seriously (since it was just a backup to the primary Atlas ICBM program) and displayed an indifferent, careless attitude that resulted in easily avoidable failure modes such as Missile C-3's range safety command destruct system relays being placed in a vibration-prone area.<ref>Green, Warren E., The Development of the SM-68 Titan, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base: Air Force Systems Command, 1962, AFSC Historical Publications Series 62-23-1, p. 94.</ref><ref>Green, Warren E., The Development of the SM-68 Titan, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base: Air Force Systems Command, 1962, AFSC Historical Publications Series 62-23-1, p. 128.</ref>\n\nIn December, Missile V-2 was undergoing a flight readiness test in a silo at [[Vandenberg Air Force Base]]. The plan was to load the missile with propellant, raise it up to firing position, and then lower it back into the silo. Unfortunately, the silo elevator collapsed, causing the Titan to fall back down and explode. The blast was so violent that it ejected a service tower from inside the silo and launched it some distance into the air before coming back down.<ref>Stumpf, David K., Titan II, p 22-26, The University of Arkansas Press, Fayetteville, Arkansas, 2000 {{ISBN|1-55728-601-9}}</ref><ref name=\"See, Earl 2014, p. 118\">See, Earl , Titan Missile Memoirs, Huntington Beach, California: American Aviation Historical Society Journal, Summer 2014, p. 118.</ref><ref>Marsh, Lt.

On 20 January 1961, Missile AJ-10 launched from LC-19 at CCAS. The flight ended in failure when an improper disconnect of a pad umbilical caused an electrical short in the second stage. The Titan performed well through the first stage burn, but after second stage separation, the fuel valve to the gas generator failed to open, preventing engine start. Missiles AJ-12 and AJ-15 in March were lost due to turbopump problems. Missile M-1's second stage lost thrust when the hydraulic pump failed. Missile SM-2 experienced early first stage shutdown; although the second stage burn was successful, it had to run to propellant depletion instead of a timed cutoff. The added stress of this operation apparently resulted in a failure of either the gas generator or turbopump, as the vernier solo phase ended prematurely. Missile M-6's second stage failed to start when an electrical relay malfunctioned and reset the ignition timer.<ref>Cleary, Mark, The 6555th Missile and Space Launches Through 1970, 45th Space Wing History Office, Patrick Air Force Base, Florida, Chapter III Section 6</ref><ref>Stumpf, David K., Titan II, p 276, The University of Arkansas Press, Fayetteville, Arkansas, 2000 {{ISBN|1-55728-601-9}}</ref>\n\nWith attention shifting to the Titan II, there were only six Titan I flights during 1962, with one failure, when Missile SM-4 (21 January) experienced an electrical short in the second stage hydraulic actuator, which gimbaled hard left at T+98 seconds. Staging was performed successfully, but the second stage engine failed to start.<ref>Stumpf, David K., Titan II, p 276, The University of Arkansas Press, Fayetteville, Arkansas, 2000 {{ISBN|1-55728-601-9}}</ref>\n\nTwelve more Titan Is were flown in 1963\u201365, with the finale being Missile SM-33, flown on 5 March 1965. The only total failure in this last stretch of flights was when Missile V-4 (1 May 1963) suffered a stuck gas generator valve and loss of engine thrust at liftoff. The Titan fell over and exploded on impact with the ground.<ref>http://www.chromehooves.net/documents/martin/titan_i_firing_history/01_-_titan_i_firing_history_ocr.pdf</ref><ref>Stumpf, David K., Titan II, p 277, The University of Arkansas Press, Fayetteville, Arkansas, 2000 {{ISBN|1-55728-601-9}}</ref>\n\nAlthough most of the Titan I's teething problems were worked out by 1961, the missile was already eclipsed not only by the Atlas, but by its own design successor, the Titan II, a bigger, more powerful ICBM with storable [[hypergolic propellant]]s. The launch pads at Cape Canaveral were quickly converted for the new vehicle. Vandenberg Launch Complex 395 continued to provide for operational test launches. The last Titan I launch was from  LC 395A  silo A-2 in March 1965.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.afspacemuseum.org/vandenberg/395A/ | title=Complex 395A | author=Air Force Space & Missile Museum | accessdate=11 November 2019 }}</ref> After a brief period as an operational ICBM, it was retired from service in 1965 when Defense Secretary [[Robert McNamara]] made the decision to phase out all first generation cryogenically-fueled missiles in favor of newer hypergolic and solid-fueled models. While decommissioned Atlas (and later Titan II) missiles were recycled and utilized for space launches, the Titan I inventory were stored and eventually  scrapped..<ref>Clemmer,  Wilbur E..1966, Phase-Out of the Atlas E and F and Titan I Weapon Systems, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base: Historical Research Division Air Force Logistics Command, 1966, p. 22-23.</ref>\n\n==Characteristics==\nProduced by the [[Glenn L. Martin Company]] (which became \"The Martin Company\" in 1957), Titan I was a two-stage, liquid-fueled [[ballistic missile]] with an effective range of 6,101 nautical miles (11,300&nbsp;km). The first stage delivered 300,000 pounds (1,330&nbsp;kN) of thrust, the second stage 80,000 pounds (356&nbsp;kN). The fact that Titan I, like Atlas, burned Rocket Propellant 1 ([[RP-1]]) and liquid oxygen ([[LOX]]) meant that the [[oxidizer]] had to be loaded onto the missile just before launch from an underground storage tank, and the missile raised above ground on the enormous elevator system, exposing the missile for some time before launch.

The Atlas missile had all three of its main rocket engines ignited at launch (two were jettisoned during flight) due to concerns about igniting rocket engines at high altitude and maintaining combustion stability.<ref>Walker,Chuck, Atlas The Ultimate Weapon, Burlington Canada: Apogee Books, 2005, {{ISBN|0-517-56904-3}}, p. 11</ref> Martin, in part, was selected as the contractor because it had \"recognized the 'magnitude of the altitude start problem' for the second stage and had a good suggestion for solving it.\"<ref>Green, Warren E., The Development of the SM-68 Titan, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base: Air Force Systems Command, 1962, AFSC Historical Publications Series 62-23-1, p. 17.</ref> Titan I's second-stage engines were reliable enough to be ignited at altitude, after separation from the first stage booster. The first stage, besides including heavy fuel tanks and engines, also had launch interface equipment and the launch pad thrust ring with it.  When the first stage had finished consuming its propellant, it dropped away, thereby decreasing the mass of the vehicle.  Titan I's ability to jettison this mass prior to the ignition of the second stage meant that Titan I had a much greater total range (and a greater range per pound of second-stage fuel) than Atlas, even if the total fuel load of Atlas had been greater.<ref>Widnal Perair S., Lecture L14 - Variable Mass Systems The: Rocket Equation, 2008, MIT OpenCourseWar</ref> As North American Aviation's [[Rocketdyne]] Division was the only manufacturer of large liquid propellent rocket engines the Air Force Western Development Division decided to develop a second source for them.

I encompassed all of the equipment and even the bases for the Titan I strategic missile. The Titan I was first American ICBM designed to be based in underground silos, and it gave USAF managers, contractors and missile crews valuable experience building and working in vast complexes containing everything the missiles and crews needed for operation and survival. The complexes were composed of an entry portal, control center, powerhouse, terminal room, two antenna silos for the [[ATHENA computer|ATHENA]] guidance radar antennas, and three launchers each composed of: three equipment terminals, three propellant terminals, and three missile silos. All connected by an extensive network of tunnels.<ref>United States Air Force, The T.O. 21M-HGM25A-1-1 Technical Manual Operation and Organizational Maintenance HGM-25A Missile Weapon System, United States Air Force, 1964, Pg 1-9</ref> Both antenna terminals and all three launchers were isolated with double door blast locks the doors of which could not be open at the same time. This was to ensure that if there was an explosion in a missile launcher or the site was under attack, only the exposed antenna and/or missile silo would be damaged.<ref>United States Air Force, The T.O. 21M-HGM25A-1-1 Technical Manual Operation and Organizational Maintenance HGM-25A Missile Weapon System, United States Air Force, 1964, Pg 1-52</ref>\n\nThe launch crew was composed of a missile combat crew commander, missile launch officer (MLO), guidance electronics officer (GEO), ballistic missile analyst technician (BMAT), and two electrical power production technicians (EPPT).<ref>United States Air Force, The T.O. 21M-HGM25A-1-1 Technical Manual Operation and Organizational Maintenance HGM-25A Missile Weapon System, United States Air Force, 1964, Pg 7-1 - 7-3</ref> There were also a cook and two Air Police.<ref>Simpson, Charles G, The Titan I part 2, Breckenridge, Colorado: Association of Air Force Missileers, October 1993, p. 5.</ref> During normal duty hours there was a site commander, site maintenance officer, site chief, job controller/expediter, tool crib operator, power house chief, three pad chiefs, three assistant pad chiefs, another cook and more air police.

First, the missiles took about 15 minutes to fuel, and then, one at a time, had to be lifted to the surface on elevators for launching and guidance, which slowed their reaction time. Rapid launching was crucial to avoid possible destruction by incoming missiles. Even though Titan complexes were designed to withstand nearby nuclear blasts antenna and missile extended for launch and guidance were quite susceptible to even a relatively distant miss.<ref>United States Air Force, The T.O. 21M-HGM25A-1-1 Technical Manual Operation and Organizational Maintenance HGM-25A Missile Weapon System, United States Air Force, 1964, page 6-1</ref> The missiles sites of a squadron were placed at least 17 (usually 20 to 30) miles apart so that a single nuclear weapon could not take out two sites.<ref>Green  Warren E..1962, The Development of the SM-68 Titan, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base: Air Force Systems Command, 1962, AFSC Historical Publications Series 62-23-1, p. 85.</ref> The sites also had to be close enough that if a sites guidance system failed it could \"handover\" its missiles to another site of the squadron.<ref>Hoselton, Gary A., Titan I Guidance System, Brekenridge, Colorado: Association of Air Force Missileers, Volume 6, Number 1998, p. 6.</ref><ref>United States Air Force, The T.O. 21M-HGM25A-1-1 Technical Manual Operation and Organizational Maintenance HGM-25A Missile Weapon System, United States Air Force, 1964, page 3-100</ref>\n\nThe distance between the antenna silos and the most distant missile silo was between 1,000 and {{convert|1300|ft|m}}.

It did not make economic sense to refurbish them as SM-65 Atlas missiles with similar payload capacities had already been converted to satellite launchers. About 33 were distributed to museums, parks and schools as static displays (see list below).

The game proceeds when a player on the [[fielding team (baseball)|fielding team]], called the [[pitcher]], throws a ball which a player on the [[batting team (baseball)|batting team]] tries to hit with a bat. The objective of the offensive team ([[Batting team (baseball)|batting team]]) is to hit the ball into the field of play, allowing its players to run the bases, having them advance counter-clockwise around four bases to score what are called \"[[Run (baseball)|runs]]\". The objective of the defensive team ([[Fielding team (baseball)|fielding team]]) is to prevent batters from becoming runners, and to prevent runners' [[base running|advance around the bases]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/documents/0/4/0/224919040/2017_Official_Baseball_Rules_dbt69t59.pdf|title=Official Rules of MLB, 2017|last=|first=|date=2017|website=|access-date=}}</ref> A run is scored when a runner legally advances around the bases in order and touches home plate (the place where the player started as a batter). The team that scores the most runs by the end of the game is the winner.\n\nThe first objective of the batting team is to have a player reach first base [[safe (baseball)|safely]]. A player on the batting team who reaches first base without being called \"[[Out (baseball)|out]]\" can attempt to advance to subsequent bases as a runner, either immediately or during teammates' turns batting. The fielding team tries to prevent runs by getting batters or runners \"out\", which forces them out of the field of play. Both the pitcher and fielders have methods of getting the batting team's players out. The opposing teams switch back and forth between batting and fielding; the batting team's turn to bat is over once the fielding team records three outs. One turn batting for each team constitutes an [[inning]]. A game is usually composed of nine innings, and the team with the greater number of runs at the end of the game wins. If scores are tied at the end of nine innings, [[extra innings]] are usually played. Baseball has no game clock, although most games end in the ninth inning.\n\nBaseball evolved from older bat-and-ball games already being played in England by the mid-18th century. This game was brought by immigrants to North America, [[History of baseball in the United States|where the modern version developed]]. By the late 19th century, baseball was widely recognized as the [[national sport]] of the [[Baseball in the United States|United States]]. Baseball is popular in North America and parts of Central and South America, the Caribbean, and East Asia, particularly in [[Baseball in Japan|Japan]], [[Baseball in South Korea|South Korea]] and [[Sports in Taiwan#Baseball|Taiwan]].\n\nIn the United States and Canada, professional [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) teams are divided into the [[National League]] (NL) and [[American League]] (AL), each with three divisions: East, West, and Central. The MLB champion is determined by [[Major League Baseball postseason|playoffs]] that culminate in the [[World Series]]. The top level of play is similarly split in Japan between the [[Central League|Central]] and [[Pacific League]]s and in Cuba between the [[Cuban National Series|West League and East League]]. The [[World Baseball Classic]], organized by the [[World Baseball Softball Confederation]], is the major international competition of the sport and attracts the top national teams from around the world.\n\n==Rules and gameplay==\n{{Further|Baseball rules|Outline of baseball}}\n[[File:Baseball diamond.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|right|Diagram of a [[baseball field]] (the term ''diamond'' may be used to refer to the square area defined by the four bases or to the entire playing field).

The other team\u2014customarily the home team\u2014bats in the bottom, or second half, of every inning. The goal of the game is to score more points ([[run (baseball)|runs]]) than the other team. The players on the team at bat attempt to score runs by touching all four bases, in order, set at the corners of the square-shaped [[baseball field|baseball diamond]]. A player bats at [[home plate]] and must attempt to safely reach a base before proceeding, [[counterclockwise]], from first base, to second base, third base, and back home to score a run. The team in the field attempts to prevent runs from scoring by recording [[out (baseball)|outs]], which remove opposing players from offensive action, until their next turn at bat comes up again. When three outs are recorded, the teams switch roles for the next half-inning. If the score of the game is tied after nine innings, [[extra innings]] are played to resolve the contest.

A batter-runner who reaches first base without being [[putout|put out]] is said to be ''[[safe (baseball)|safe]]'' and is on base. A batter-runner may choose to remain at first base or attempt to advance to second base or even beyond\u2014however far the player believes can be reached safely. A player who reaches base despite proper play by the fielders has recorded a [[hit (baseball)|hit]]. A player who reaches first base safely on a hit is credited with a [[single (baseball)|single]]. If a player makes it to second base safely as a direct result of a hit, it is a [[double (baseball)|double]]; third base, a [[triple (baseball)|triple]]. If the ball is hit in the air within the foul lines over the entire outfield (and outfield fence, if there is one), or otherwise safely circles all the bases, it is a [[home run]]: the batter and any runners on base may all freely circle the bases, each scoring a run. This is the most desirable result for the batter. A player who reaches base due to a fielding mistake is not credited with a hit\u2014instead, the responsible fielder is charged with an [[error (baseball)|error]].<ref name=RulesPuttingBallInPlay/>\n\nAny runners already on base may attempt to advance on batted balls that land, or contact the ground, in fair territory, before or after the ball lands. A runner on first base ''must'' attempt to advance if a ball lands in play. If a ball hit into play rolls foul before passing through the infield, it becomes [[dead ball (baseball)|dead]] and any runners must return to the base they occupied when the play began. If the ball is hit in the air and caught before it lands, the batter has [[flyout|flied out]] and any runners on base may attempt to advance only if they [[tag up]] (contact the base they occupied when the play began, as or after the ball is caught). Runners may also attempt to advance to the next base while the pitcher is in the process of delivering the ball to home plate; a successful effort is a [[stolen base]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/02_definition_of_terms.pdf|title=Official Rules/2.00\u2014Definitions of Terms|accessdate=2009-02-02|publisher=Major League Baseball|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090205011321/http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/02_definition_of_terms.pdf|archivedate=5 February 2009 |url-status=live}} {{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/05_putting_ball_in_play.pdf|title=Official Rules/5.00\u2014Putting the Ball in Play.

On rare occasions, a batter may be at the plate when, without the batter's hitting the ball, a third out is recorded against a teammate\u2014for instance, a runner getting [[caught stealing]] (tagged out attempting to steal a base). A batter with this sort of incomplete plate appearance starts off the team's next turn batting; any balls or strikes recorded against the batter the previous inning are erased. A runner may circle the bases only once per plate appearance and thus can score at most a single run per batting turn. Once a player has completed a plate appearance, that player may not bat again until the eight other members of the player's team have all taken their turn at bat in the [[batting order (baseball)|batting order]]. The batting order is set before the game begins, and may not be altered except for substitutions. Once a player has been removed for a substitute, that player may not reenter the game.

In 1915, a baseball instructional manual pointed out that every single pitch, of which there are often more than two hundred in a game, involves an individual, one-on-one contest: \"the pitcher and the batter in a battle of wits\".<ref>Clarke and Dawson (1915), p. 48.</ref> Pitcher, batter, and fielder all act essentially independent of each other. While coaching staffs can signal pitcher or batter to pursue certain tactics, the execution of the play itself is a series of solitary acts. If the batter hits a line drive, the outfielder is solely responsible for deciding to try to catch it or play it on the bounce and for succeeding or failing. The [[baseball statistics|statistical precision of baseball]] is both facilitated by this isolation and reinforces it.\n\nCricket is more similar to baseball than many other team sports in this regard: while the individual focus in cricket is mitigated by the importance of the [[partnership (cricket)|batting partnership]] and the practicalities of tandem running, it is enhanced by the fact that a batsman may occupy the [[wicket]] for an hour or much more. There is no statistical equivalent in cricket for the fielding error and thus less emphasis on personal responsibility in this area of play.<ref>Morton, Richard, \"Baseball in England\", ''Badminton Magazine'', August 1896, pp. 157\u2013158: \"The scoring is one of the most interesting features in this new importation from America [baseball]. Every detail of play is recorded, and a man's mistakes are tabulated as well as his successes... A line in a cricket score may read, 'Lockwood, ''caught'' Stoddart, ''bowled'' J. T. Hearne; 30.'... [T]here is so much that is left out! There is no mention of the fact that O'Brien missed Lockwood before he had scored, and that somebody else failed to take a chance when his score was ten. These are items that go to make cricket history; but there is no record of them in the analysis... The man who catches a ball is thought worthy of mention, but the man who muffs one does not suffer by publicity.\"</ref>\n\n=== Uniqueness of each baseball park ===\n{{Further|Baseball park}}\n[[File:Fenway from Legend's Box.jpg|thumb|[[Fenway Park]], home of the [[Boston Red Sox]]. The [[Green Monster]] is visible beyond the playing field on the left.]]\n\nUnlike those of most sports, baseball playing fields can vary significantly in size and shape. While the dimensions of the infield are specifically regulated, the only constraint on outfield size and shape for professional teams, following the rules of MLB and [[Minor League Baseball]], is that fields built or remodeled since June 1, 1958, must have a minimum distance of {{convert|325|ft|m|0}} from home plate to the fences in left and right field and {{convert|400|ft|m|0}} to center.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/01_objectives_of_the_game.pdf|title=Official Rules/1.00\u2014Objectives of the Game.

The most famously idiosyncratic outfield boundary is the left-field wall at Boston's [[Fenway Park]], in use since 1912: the [[Green Monster]] is {{convert|310|ft|m|0}} from home plate down the line and {{convert|37|ft|m|0}} tall.<ref>Powers (2003), p. 85.</ref>\n\nSimilarly, there are no regulations at all concerning the dimensions of foul territory. Thus a foul fly ball may be entirely out of play in a park with little space between the foul lines and the stands, but a foulout in a park with more expansive foul ground.<ref>Powers (2003), p. 219.</ref> A fence in foul territory that is close to the outfield line will tend to direct balls that strike it back toward the fielders, while one that is farther away may actually prompt more collisions, as outfielders run full speed to field balls deep in the corner.

Other local factors, such as altitude and climate, can also significantly affect play. A given stadium may acquire a reputation as a pitcher's park or a hitter's park, if one or the other discipline notably benefits from its unique mix of elements. The most exceptional park in this regard is [[Coors Field]], home of the [[Colorado Rockies]]. Its high altitude\u2014{{convert|5282|ft|m|0}} above sea level\u2014is partly responsible for giving it the strongest hitter's park effect in the major leagues due to the low air pressure.<ref>Keri (2007), pp. 295\u2013301.</ref> [[Wrigley Field]], home of the Chicago Cubs, is known for its fickle disposition: a hitter's park when the strong winds off [[Lake Michigan]] are blowing out, it becomes more of a pitcher's park when they are blowing in.<ref>{{cite web|author=Gilbert, Steve|date=September 30, 2008|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20080930&content_id=3575106|title=Wrigley's Winds Don't Rattle Lowe|accessdate=2009-02-17|publisher=Major League Baseball|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201003317/http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20080930&content_id=3575106&vkey=ps2008news&fext=.jsp&c_id=mlb|archivedate=December 1, 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref> The absence of a standardized field affects not only how particular games play out, but the nature of team rosters and players' statistical records. For example, hitting a fly ball {{convert|330|ft|m|-1}} into right field might result in an easy catch on the [[warning track]] at one park, and a home run at another. A team that plays in a park with a relatively short right field, such as the [[New York Yankees]], will tend to stock its roster with left-handed [[pull hitter]]s, who can best exploit it. On the individual level, a player who spends most of his career with a team that plays in a hitter's park will gain an advantage in batting statistics over time\u2014even more so if his talents are especially suited to the park.<ref>{{cite news|author=Sheinin, Dave|date=March 26, 2008|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/24/AR2008032402798.html|title=After Move, a Breaking In Process|accessdate=2009-02-17|work=[[The Washington Post]]}} See also Powers (2003), p. 85.</ref>\n\n== Statistics ==\n{{Further|Baseball statistics}}\n\nOrganized baseball lends itself to [[statistics]] to a greater degree than many other sports. Each play is discrete and has a relatively small number of possible outcomes.

The game proceeds when a player on the [[fielding team (baseball)|fielding team]], called the [[pitcher]], throws a ball which a player on the [[batting team (baseball)|batting team]] tries to hit with a bat. The objective of the offensive team ([[Batting team (baseball)|batting team]]) is to hit the ball into the field of play, allowing its players to run the bases, having them advance counter-clockwise around four bases to score what are called \"[[Run (baseball)|runs]]\". The objective of the defensive team ([[Fielding team (baseball)|fielding team]]) is to prevent batters from becoming runners, and to prevent runners' [[base running|advance around the bases]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/documents/0/4/0/224919040/2017_Official_Baseball_Rules_dbt69t59.pdf|title=Official Rules of MLB, 2017|last=|first=|date=2017|website=|access-date=}}</ref> A run is scored when a runner legally advances around the bases in order and touches home plate (the place where the player started as a batter). The team that scores the most runs by the end of the game is the winner.\n\nThe first objective of the batting team is to have a player reach first base [[safe (baseball)|safely]]. A player on the batting team who reaches first base without being called \"[[Out (baseball)|out]]\" can attempt to advance to subsequent bases as a runner, either immediately or during teammates' turns batting. The fielding team tries to prevent runs by getting batters or runners \"out\", which forces them out of the field of play. Both the pitcher and fielders have methods of getting the batting team's players out. The opposing teams switch back and forth between batting and fielding; the batting team's turn to bat is over once the fielding team records three outs. One turn batting for each team constitutes an [[inning]]. A game is usually composed of nine innings, and the team with the greater number of runs at the end of the game wins. If scores are tied at the end of nine innings, [[extra innings]] are usually played. Baseball has no game clock, although most games end in the ninth inning.\n\nBaseball evolved from older bat-and-ball games already being played in England by the mid-18th century. This game was brought by immigrants to North America, [[History of baseball in the United States|where the modern version developed]]. By the late 19th century, baseball was widely recognized as the [[national sport]] of the [[Baseball in the United States|United States]]. Baseball is popular in North America and parts of Central and South America, the Caribbean, and East Asia, particularly in [[Baseball in Japan|Japan]], [[Baseball in South Korea|South Korea]] and [[Sports in Taiwan#Baseball|Taiwan]].\n\nIn the United States and Canada, professional [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) teams are divided into the [[National League]] (NL) and [[American League]] (AL), each with three divisions: East, West, and Central. The MLB champion is determined by [[Major League Baseball postseason|playoffs]] that culminate in the [[World Series]]. The top level of play is similarly split in Japan between the [[Central League|Central]] and [[Pacific League]]s and in Cuba between the [[Cuban National Series|West League and East League]]. The [[World Baseball Classic]], organized by the [[World Baseball Softball Confederation]], is the major international competition of the sport and attracts the top national teams from around the world.\n\n==Rules and gameplay==\n{{Further|Baseball rules|Outline of baseball}}\n[[File:Baseball diamond.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|right|Diagram of a [[baseball field]] (the term ''diamond'' may be used to refer to the square area defined by the four bases or to the entire playing field).

Children often play on smaller fields.]]\n\nA baseball game is played between two teams, each composed of nine players, that take turns playing offense ([[Batting (baseball)|batting]] and [[baserunning]]) and defense ([[pitch (baseball)|pitching]] and fielding). A pair of turns, one at bat and one in the field, by each team constitutes an [[inning]].

The other team\u2014customarily the home team\u2014bats in the bottom, or second half, of every inning. The goal of the game is to score more points ([[run (baseball)|runs]]) than the other team. The players on the team at bat attempt to score runs by touching all four bases, in order, set at the corners of the square-shaped [[baseball field|baseball diamond]]. A player bats at [[home plate]] and must attempt to safely reach a base before proceeding, [[counterclockwise]], from first base, to second base, third base, and back home to score a run. The team in the field attempts to prevent runs from scoring by recording [[out (baseball)|outs]], which remove opposing players from offensive action, until their next turn at bat comes up again. When three outs are recorded, the teams switch roles for the next half-inning. If the score of the game is tied after nine innings, [[extra innings]] are played to resolve the contest. Many amateur games, particularly unorganized ones, involve different numbers of players and innings.<ref>Thurston (2000), p. 15; {{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/official_info/official_rules/foreword.jsp|title=Official Rules/Foreword|accessdate=2009-02-02|publisher=Major League Baseball|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090124020327/http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/official_info/official_rules/foreword.jsp|archivedate=24 January 2009 |url-status=live}} {{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/01_objectives_of_the_game.pdf|title=Official Rules/1.00\u2014Objectives of the Game (Rules 1.01\u20131.03)|accessdate=2009-02-02|publisher=Major League Baseball|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090205011325/http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/01_objectives_of_the_game.pdf|archivedate=5 February 2009 |url-status=live}} {{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/02_definition_of_terms.pdf|title=Official Rules/2.00\u2014Definitions of Terms|accessdate=2009-02-02|publisher=Major League Baseball|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090205011321/http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/02_definition_of_terms.pdf|archivedate=5 February 2009 |url-status=live}} {{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/04_starting_ending_game.pdf|title=Official Rules/4.00\u2014Starting and Ending a Game (Rule 4.10)|accessdate=2009-02-02|publisher=Major League Baseball|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090205011327/http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/04_starting_ending_game.pdf|archivedate=5 February 2009 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe game is played on a field whose primary boundaries, the foul lines, extend forward from home plate at 45-degree angles. The 90-degree area within the foul lines is referred to as fair territory; the 270-degree area outside them is foul territory. The part of the field enclosed by the bases and several yards beyond them is the [[infield]]; the area farther beyond the infield is the [[outfield]]. In the middle of the infield is a raised pitcher's mound, with a rectangular rubber plate (the rubber) at its center. The outer boundary of the outfield is typically demarcated by a raised fence, which may be of any material and height. The fair territory between home plate and the outfield boundary is baseball's field of play, though significant events can take place in foul territory, as well.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/01_objectives_of_the_game.pdf|title=Official Rules/1.00\u2014Objectives of the Game (Rules 1.04\u20131.07)|accessdate=2009-02-02|publisher=Major League Baseball|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090205011325/http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/01_objectives_of_the_game.pdf|archivedate=5 February 2009 |url-status=live}} {{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/02_definition_of_terms.pdf|title=Official Rules/2.00\u2014Definitions of Terms|accessdate=2009-02-02|publisher=Major League Baseball|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090205011321/http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/02_definition_of_terms.pdf|archivedate=5 February 2009 |url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThere are three basic tools of baseball: the [[baseball (ball)|ball]], the [[baseball bat|bat]], and the [[baseball glove|glove or mitt]]:\n* The baseball is about the size of an adult's fist, around 9&nbsp;inches (23 centimeters) in circumference.

On rare occasions, a batter may be at the plate when, without the batter's hitting the ball, a third out is recorded against a teammate\u2014for instance, a runner getting [[caught stealing]] (tagged out attempting to steal a base). A batter with this sort of incomplete plate appearance starts off the team's next turn batting; any balls or strikes recorded against the batter the previous inning are erased. A runner may circle the bases only once per plate appearance and thus can score at most a single run per batting turn. Once a player has completed a plate appearance, that player may not bat again until the eight other members of the player's team have all taken their turn at bat in the [[batting order (baseball)|batting order]]. The batting order is set before the game begins, and may not be altered except for substitutions. Once a player has been removed for a substitute, that player may not reenter the game.

In contrast, baseball has no clock, thus a team cannot win without getting the last batter out and rallies are not constrained by time. At almost any turn in any baseball game, the most advantageous strategy is some form of aggressive strategy.<ref>Mount, Nicholas James, \"Team Sports\", in ''Encyclopedia of Time'', ed. Samuel L.

In 1915, a baseball instructional manual pointed out that every single pitch, of which there are often more than two hundred in a game, involves an individual, one-on-one contest: \"the pitcher and the batter in a battle of wits\".<ref>Clarke and Dawson (1915), p. 48.</ref> Pitcher, batter, and fielder all act essentially independent of each other. While coaching staffs can signal pitcher or batter to pursue certain tactics, the execution of the play itself is a series of solitary acts. If the batter hits a line drive, the outfielder is solely responsible for deciding to try to catch it or play it on the bounce and for succeeding or failing. The [[baseball statistics|statistical precision of baseball]] is both facilitated by this isolation and reinforces it.\n\nCricket is more similar to baseball than many other team sports in this regard: while the individual focus in cricket is mitigated by the importance of the [[partnership (cricket)|batting partnership]] and the practicalities of tandem running, it is enhanced by the fact that a batsman may occupy the [[wicket]] for an hour or much more. There is no statistical equivalent in cricket for the fielding error and thus less emphasis on personal responsibility in this area of play.<ref>Morton, Richard, \"Baseball in England\", ''Badminton Magazine'', August 1896, pp. 157\u2013158: \"The scoring is one of the most interesting features in this new importation from America [baseball]. Every detail of play is recorded, and a man's mistakes are tabulated as well as his successes... A line in a cricket score may read, 'Lockwood, ''caught'' Stoddart, ''bowled'' J. T. Hearne; 30.'... [T]here is so much that is left out! There is no mention of the fact that O'Brien missed Lockwood before he had scored, and that somebody else failed to take a chance when his score was ten. These are items that go to make cricket history; but there is no record of them in the analysis... The man who catches a ball is thought worthy of mention, but the man who muffs one does not suffer by publicity.\"</ref>\n\n=== Uniqueness of each baseball park ===\n{{Further|Baseball park}}\n[[File:Fenway from Legend's Box.jpg|thumb|[[Fenway Park]], home of the [[Boston Red Sox]]. The [[Green Monster]] is visible beyond the playing field on the left.]]\n\nUnlike those of most sports, baseball playing fields can vary significantly in size and shape. While the dimensions of the infield are specifically regulated, the only constraint on outfield size and shape for professional teams, following the rules of MLB and [[Minor League Baseball]], is that fields built or remodeled since June 1, 1958, must have a minimum distance of {{convert|325|ft|m|0}} from home plate to the fences in left and right field and {{convert|400|ft|m|0}} to center.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/01_objectives_of_the_game.pdf|title=Official Rules/1.00\u2014Objectives of the Game.

For example, at [[Minute Maid Park]], which became the home of the [[Houston Astros]] in 2000, the [[Crawford Boxes]] in left field are only {{convert|315|ft|m|0}} from home plate.<ref>{{cite news |author=Nightengale, Bob|date=August 20, 2008|url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/baseball/2008-08-20-bestseats-minutemaid_N.htm|title=No. 8: Out in Left Field in Houston's Crawford Boxes|accessdate=2009-02-17|work=USA Today}}</ref> There are no rules at all that address the height of fences or other structures at the edge of the outfield. The most famously idiosyncratic outfield boundary is the left-field wall at Boston's [[Fenway Park]], in use since 1912: the [[Green Monster]] is {{convert|310|ft|m|0}} from home plate down the line and {{convert|37|ft|m|0}} tall.<ref>Powers (2003), p. 85.</ref>\n\nSimilarly, there are no regulations at all concerning the dimensions of foul territory. Thus a foul fly ball may be entirely out of play in a park with little space between the foul lines and the stands, but a foulout in a park with more expansive foul ground.<ref>Powers (2003), p. 219.</ref> A fence in foul territory that is close to the outfield line will tend to direct balls that strike it back toward the fielders, while one that is farther away may actually prompt more collisions, as outfielders run full speed to field balls deep in the corner. These variations can make the difference between a double and a triple or [[inside-the-park home run]].<ref>Puhalla, Krans, and Goatley (2003), p. 198; {{cite news|author=Shaikin, Bill|date=May 27, 2006|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2006/may/27/sports/sp-angels27|title=Guerrero Becomes Mr. Inside|accessdate=2009-02-17|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}</ref> The surface of the field is also unregulated.

Other local factors, such as altitude and climate, can also significantly affect play. A given stadium may acquire a reputation as a pitcher's park or a hitter's park, if one or the other discipline notably benefits from its unique mix of elements. The most exceptional park in this regard is [[Coors Field]], home of the [[Colorado Rockies]]. Its high altitude\u2014{{convert|5282|ft|m|0}} above sea level\u2014is partly responsible for giving it the strongest hitter's park effect in the major leagues due to the low air pressure.<ref>Keri (2007), pp. 295\u2013301.</ref> [[Wrigley Field]], home of the Chicago Cubs, is known for its fickle disposition: a hitter's park when the strong winds off [[Lake Michigan]] are blowing out, it becomes more of a pitcher's park when they are blowing in.<ref>{{cite web|author=Gilbert, Steve|date=September 30, 2008|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20080930&content_id=3575106|title=Wrigley's Winds Don't Rattle Lowe|accessdate=2009-02-17|publisher=Major League Baseball|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201003317/http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20080930&content_id=3575106&vkey=ps2008news&fext=.jsp&c_id=mlb|archivedate=December 1, 2008|url-status=dead}}</ref> The absence of a standardized field affects not only how particular games play out, but the nature of team rosters and players' statistical records. For example, hitting a fly ball {{convert|330|ft|m|-1}} into right field might result in an easy catch on the [[warning track]] at one park, and a home run at another. A team that plays in a park with a relatively short right field, such as the [[New York Yankees]], will tend to stock its roster with left-handed [[pull hitter]]s, who can best exploit it. On the individual level, a player who spends most of his career with a team that plays in a hitter's park will gain an advantage in batting statistics over time\u2014even more so if his talents are especially suited to the park.<ref>{{cite news|author=Sheinin, Dave|date=March 26, 2008|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/03/24/AR2008032402798.html|title=After Move, a Breaking In Process|accessdate=2009-02-17|work=[[The Washington Post]]}} See also Powers (2003), p. 85.</ref>\n\n== Statistics ==\n{{Further|Baseball statistics}}\n\nOrganized baseball lends itself to [[statistics]] to a greater degree than many other sports. Each play is discrete and has a relatively small number of possible outcomes. In the late 19th century, a former cricket player, English-born [[Henry Chadwick (writer)|Henry Chadwick]] of [[Brooklyn]], was responsible for the \"development of the [[box score (baseball)|box score]], tabular standings, the annual baseball guide, the [[batting average (baseball)|batting average]], and most of the common statistics and tables used to describe baseball.\"<ref name=T16>Tygiel (2000), p. 16.</ref> The statistical record is so central to the game's \"historical essence\" that Chadwick came to be known as Father Baseball.<ref name=T16/> In the 1920s, American newspapers began devoting more and more attention to baseball statistics, initiating what journalist and historian [[Alan Schwarz]] describes as a \"tectonic shift in sports, as intrigue that once focused mostly on teams began to go to individual players and their statistics lines.\"<ref>Schwarz (2004), p. 50.</ref>\n\nThe Official Baseball Rules administered by MLB require the [[official scorer]] to categorize each baseball play unambiguously.

The term was coined around 1980 by one of the field's leading proponents, [[Bill James]], and derives from the [[Society for American Baseball Research]] (SABR).<ref>Gray, Scott, ''The Mind of Bill James: How a Complete Outsider Changed Baseball'' (Doubleday, 2006), p. ix.</ref>\n\nThe growing popularity of sabermetrics since the early 1980s has brought more attention to two batting statistics that sabermetricians argue are much better gauges of a batter's skill than batting average:<ref>Guzzo (2007), pp. 20\u201321, 67; Schwarz (2004), p. 233; Lewis (2003), p. 127.</ref>\n* [[On-base percentage]] measures a batter's ability to get on base. It is calculated by taking the sum of the batter's successes in getting on base (hits plus walks plus hit by pitches) and dividing that by the batter's total plate appearances (at bats plus walks plus hit by pitches plus sacrifice flies), except for sacrifice bunts.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/10_the_official_scorer.pdf|title=Official Rules/10.00\u2014The Official Scorer (Rule 10.21f)|accessdate=2009-02-22|publisher=Major League Baseball|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090224215917/http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/downloads/y2008/official_rules/10_the_official_scorer.pdf|archivedate=February 24, 2009|url-status=live}}</ref>\n* [[Slugging percentage]] measures a batter's ability to hit for power.

[[Baseball card]]s were introduced in the late 19th century as [[trade card]]s. A typical example featured an image of a baseball player on one side and advertising for a business on the other. In the early 1900s they were produced widely as promotional items by tobacco and confectionery companies. The 1930s saw the popularization of the modern style of baseball card, with a player photograph accompanied on the rear by statistics and biographical data. Baseball cards\u2014many of which are now prized collectibles\u2014are the source of the much broader [[trading card]] industry, involving similar products for different sports and non-sports-related fields.<ref>Zoss (2004), pp. 16\u201325.</ref>\n\nModern [[fantasy sports]] began in 1980 with the invention of [[Fantasy baseball#Rotisserie League Baseball|Rotisserie League Baseball]] by New York writer [[Daniel Okrent]] and several friends.
