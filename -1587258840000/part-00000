{"title_page": "Illyrian weaponry", "text_new": "[[File:Recreation of Frieze showing War Chariots from Slovenia 6th century BCE (Vackasitula).jpg|thumb|right|310px|Illyrian [[chariot]]s from Vace - 6th century BC]]\n\n'''Illyrian weaponry''' played an important role in the makeup of Illyrian armies and in conflicts involving the [[Illyrians]]. Of all the ancients sources the most important and abundant writings are those of [[Ennius]] (239 -169 BC), a Roman poet of [[Messapians|Messapian]] origin. Weapons of all sorts were also placed intact in the graves of Illyrian warriors and provide a detailed picture for archaeologists on the distribution and development of Illyrian weaponry.\n\n==Shields==\nShields were used among the Illyrians from the end of the [[Bronze Age]], but very little is known about the early shields until the [[Iron Age]]. In this period, Illyrian shields were made of wood and leather and as a result no such example has survived.<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:BalkanPlate.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Illyrian circular shields on the [[Gradist\u00eb belt-plate]]- 280 BC]]  --> During the Iron Age a metal plate-cover was attached to the shields. The most common Illyrian shield was the circular shield, although northern Illyrians and the [[Japodes]] also used an oval or rectangular type. The circular shield was small, and was decorated with embedded circles and semicircles on the sides. It resembled the Macedonian shield of the time, but differed in the number of circles, which were a symbolic decoration. One of the best examples of the Illyrian circular shield, coated in bronze, was found in a [[Liburnian]] necropolis in [[Nin, Croatia|Nin]] and dates from the 4th century BC. The circular shield was widely used from Glasinac in [[Bosnia]] to [[Albania]]. They are depicted on Illyrian city coins of [[Lezh\u00eb]] and [[Shkod\u00ebr]]. Similar to the Illyrian oval shield in northern Illyria was the shield that the [[Celts]] brought with them during the Gallic invasion of the Balkans in the 4th-3rd centuries BC. The Celtic shield was wooden and oblong, with an iron boss.<ref>^ a b Early Roman Armies (Men-at-Arms) by Nicholas Sekunda and Richard Hook, 1995, {{ISBN|1-85532-513-6}}, Colour plates, The Venetic fighting system, Fifth century BC</ref><ref>a b The Illyrians: history and culture, History and Culture Series, The Illyrians: History and Culture, Aleksandar Stip\u010devi\u0107, {{ISBN|0-8155-5052-9}},1977, page 174, \"Resembling the northern Illyrian oval shield was one introduced into Illyria by the Celts. Apart from the iron boss, nothing was preserved of these Celtic shields. It is known though that they were oblong shaped and made of wood with an umbo in the center\"</ref>\n\n==Breast armor==\nBreast armour was a rare and very interesting part of Illyrian armor. A type of breast-armor made of bronze plate was only used by northern Illyrians. Up to now only three of these have been discovered in Novo Mesto, Sticna-Verpole and St. Vid. All date before 500 BC. Other Illyrian did not use breast armor. Only the Glasinac Illyrians used a type of breast armor if breast armor can be considered a jacket made of cloth or leather with parts of bronze. Another form of body armor was a bronze pectoral that may have protected part of the back as well. It was more like a disc \"breastplate\" of 10&nbsp;cm in diameter.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">The Illyrians: History and Culture,Aleksandar Stip\u010devi\u0107</ref>\n\n==Greaves==\nIn the 7th century BC, bronze greaves were used by Illyrian warriors. It is possible that Illyrians used leather greaves in an earlier time, the same as those used by the [[Mycenaeans]], but nothing is known about them. Bronze greaves first appear among the Illyrians in southern [[Illyria]] where examples have been found dating to the 7th century BC, and also from Glasinac from the same period. The bronze greaves discovered in a prince's grave in Gllasinac are interesting especially for the decorations depicted on them. Warships, circles and triangular motives are carved on the outer surfaces. The two last-mentioned decorations were believed to protect the warrior while in combat. Up to the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] era bronze greaves were rarely used and only by wealthy warriors.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\n==Helmets==\nHelmets are found more abundantly in Illyrian graves because of their higher status. Bronze helmets were made by the northern Illyrian from the 7th century BC. At that time and probably earlier the [[Cone (geometry)|conical]] helmet was used. Later in these areas the [[Shmarjet helmet]], named after Shmarjet of [[Novo Mesto]], was used by the [[Japodes]].<ref>Wilkes, J. J.

They were made from the skeletons of bushes and painted with clay. Round bronze discs and studs were often embedded around the helmet. There were two varieties, one with a [[wicker]] base and one sewn together with chain mail. Up to now thirty Shmarjet helmets have been found. Among the northern Illyrians the bronze helmet developed into the conical or [[pot helmet]].<ref>Peter Connoly, Greece & Rome at War, {{ISBN|1-85367-303-X}}, page 102-103</ref> The conical helmet was used in the 6th century BC and sometimes had a plume. From the 5th-4th century BC under the influence of the [[Etruscans]] and other Italik peoples, the [[Negau helmet]] was used also by the northern Illyrians. The Agrianes who were in close contact with the Macedons and [[Thracians]] used the [[Phrygian type helmet]].\n\nThe most important and widespread helmet was the [[Illyrian helmet]]. Helmets of this type have been discovered in many sites in [[Albania]], [[Bosnia]], [[Croatia]] (near the coast), [[North Macedonia]], [[Kosovo]] and [[Serbia]]. Many scientists date the oldest Illyrian helmets from the 7th century BC Greece and according to them later helmets found in southern Illyria also from the 7th century BC are imports from Greece. However, other experts, especially the Albanian archaeologist Hasan Ceka, present arguments in favor of the indigenous Illyrian helmet. According to Ceka the Illyrian helmet is an original Illyrian type of helmet dating from the 7th century BC and used up to the 2nd century BC, and not only up to the 4th century BC, as thought earlier. Proof of such late use is offered by depictions of the helmet on Illyrian coins, especially those of king [[Gentius]]. Helmets were a privilege limited to the minority of warriors who could afford or obtain them.\n\n==Swords==\n[[File:SicaAncient.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Sica]], ancient weapon of the [[Illyrians]]]]\nThe main Illyrian fighting sword was the [[sica]], a short single-edged curved sword used by the [[Thraex]] gladiators in the Roman world. The sica was developed during the Bronze Age and was similar to the [[Greek culture|Greek]] [[machaira]]. It was originally depicted as a curved sword with a blade about {{convert|16|-|18|in|cm|abbr=off}} long. The distinctive shape was designed to get around the sides of an opponent's shield in order to stab or slash him in the back. Although the sica was used by many peoples around the [[Balkans]], the Romans regarded the sica as a distinctive Illyrian weapon, used as well by inhabitants of Dalmatia and present day Croatia, parts of Bosnia, Herzegovina and Albania. Another Illyrian sword type was the fighting-sword, which was 20\u201330&nbsp;cm long. Short curved swords and long swords were also used. In addition, Illyrians used various knives.\n\n==Spears==\nThe Illyrians used the thrusting spears and the [[sibyna]], which resembled a boar spear. The sibyna was a long, metallic spear and is commonly found all over Illyria, but especially in the necropolis of [[Bosnia]].\n\n==Other weaponry==\nThe bow and arrow, used by Illyrians from the 2nd millennium BC, became an important weapon for the Illyrian infantry. Among the axes used were battle axes and single handed axes. [[Chariot]]s were only known to be used by the [[Daunians]] and northern Illyrians in Slovenia from depictions on [[Daunian stele]] and Illyrian situla. They may have been widespread all over Illyria, but not a single one has been discovered.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Illyrians]]\n*[[Illyrian warfare]]\n*[[Ancient warfare]]\n\n== References ==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{commons|Illyria & Illyrians}}\n\n{{Illyrians}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Illyrian Weaponry}}\n[[Category:Illyrian warfare]]\n[[Category:Ancient weapons]]\n", "text_old": "[[File:Recreation of Frieze showing War Chariots from Slovenia 6th century BCE (Vackasitula).jpg|thumb|right|310px|Illyrian [[chariot]]s from Vace - 6th century BC]]\n\n'''Illyrian weaponry''' played an important role in the makeup of Illyrian armies and in conflicts involving the [[Illyrians]]. Of all the ancients sources the most important and abundant writings are those of [[Ennius]] (239 -169 BC), a Roman poet of [[Messapians|Messapian]] origin. Weapons of all sorts were also placed intact in the graves of Illyrian warriors and provide a detailed picture for archaeologists on the distribution and development of Illyrian weaponry.\n\n==Shields==\nShields were used among the Illyrians from the end of the [[Bronze Age]], but very little is known about the early shields until the [[Iron Age]]. In this period, Illyrian shields were made of wood and leather and as a result no such example has survived.<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:BalkanPlate.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Illyrian circular shields on the [[Gradist\u00eb belt-plate]]- 280 BC]]  -->During the Iron Age a metal plate-cover was attached to the shields. The most common Illyrian shield was the circular shield, although northern Illyrians and the [[Japodes]] also used an oval or rectangular type. The circular shield was small, and was decorated with embedded circles and semicircles on the sides. It resembled the Macedonian shield of the time, but differed in the number of circles, which were a symbolic decoration. One of the best examples of the Illyrian circular shield, coated in bronze, was found in a [[Liburnian]] necropolis in [[Nin, Croatia|Nin]] and dates from the 4th century BC. The circular shield was widely used from Glasinac in [[Bosnia]] to [[Albania]]. They are depicted on Illyrian city coins of [[Lezh\u00eb]] and [[Shkod\u00ebr]]. Similar to the Illyrian oval shield in northern Illyria was the shield that the [[Celts]] brought with them during the Gallic invasion of the Balkans in the 4th-3rd centuries BC. The Celtic shield was wooden and oblong, with an iron boss.<ref>^ a b Early Roman Armies (Men-at-Arms) by Nicholas Sekunda and Richard Hook, 1995, {{ISBN|1-85532-513-6}}, Colour plates, The Venetic fighting system, Fifth century BC</ref><ref>a b The Illyrians: history and culture, History and Culture Series, The Illyrians: History and Culture, Aleksandar Stip\u010devi\u0107, {{ISBN|0-8155-5052-9}},1977, page 174, \"Resembling the northern Illyrian oval shield was one introduced into Illyria by the Celts. Apart from the iron boss, nothing was preserved of these Celtic shields. It is known though that they were oblong shaped and made of wood with an umbo in the center\"</ref>\n\n==Breast armor==\nBreast armour was a rare and very interesting part of Illyrian armor. A type of breast-armor made of bronze plate was only used by northern Illyrians. Up to now only three of these have been discovered in Novo Mesto, Sticna-Verpole and St. Vid. All date before 500 BC. Other Illyrian did not use breast armor. Only the Glasinac Illyrians used a type of breast armor if breast armor can be considered a jacket made of cloth or leather with parts of bronze. Another form of body armor was a bronze pectoral that may have protected part of the back as well. It was more like a disc \"breastplate\" of 10&nbsp;cm in diameter.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\">The Illyrians: History and Culture,Aleksandar Stip\u010devi\u0107</ref>\n\n==Greaves==\nIn the 7th century BC, bronze greaves were used by Illyrian warriors. It is possible that Illyrians used leather greaves in an earlier time, the same as those used by the [[Mycenaeans]], but nothing is known about them. Bronze greaves first appear among the Illyrians in southern [[Illyria]] where examples have been found dating to the 7th century BC, and also from Glasinac from the same period. The bronze greaves discovered in a prince's grave in Gllasinac are interesting especially for the decorations depicted on them. Warships, circles and triangular motives are carved on the outer surfaces. The two last-mentioned decorations were believed to protect the warrior while in combat. Up to the [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] era bronze greaves were rarely used and only by wealthy warriors.<ref name=\"autogenerated1\"/>\n\n==Helmets==\nHelmets are found more abundantly in Illyrian graves because of their higher status. Bronze helmets were made by the northern Illyrian from the 7th century BC. At that time and probably earlier the [[Cone (geometry)|conical]] helmet was used.

The real beginning of his career happened with the [[Prague]] band TAM. K\u0159\u00ed\u017eek did not stay with them for long, however. In the first months of 1985, TAM was offered an opening slot for the annual concert of the band Orient, which they accepted without hesitation. Coincidentally, this concert was attended by members of the heavy metal band [[Vitacit]], whose lead singer Dan Horyna departed in February of the same year. Vitacit liked K\u0159\u00ed\u017eek's vocals so much that they immediately offered him the vacant spot, which he accepted.\n\n===Vitacit===\nVitacit had been together since 1973, but had never recorded any material. In 1985, after K\u0159\u00ed\u017eek joined, they met guitarist and singer [[Milo\u0161 \"Dodo\" Dole\u017eal]], who became the band's new frontman. K\u0159\u00ed\u017eek and Dole\u017eal went on to write a number of hit songs together.\nVitacit had much success and filled concert halls throughout 1985 and 1986. By 1987, they began to attract attention from record labels, and received several offers. In January of that year, however, Ladislav K\u0159\u00ed\u017eek announced his departure from the band. His last concerts with Vitacit were held in a grim atmosphere, and on 15 March 1987, K\u0159\u00ed\u017eek and Vitacit performed together for the last time.\n\n===Citron===\nIn February 1987, the [[Ostrava]]-based metal band [[Citron (band)|Citron]] was hit by an unexpected event. Their singer Stanislav Hranick\u00fd broke his leg and was unable to perform for an extended period of time. For this reason, the band hired Ladislav K\u0159\u00ed\u017eek as his replacement. They immediately began to work on their third album, titled ''Radegast''. Upon release, the album went gold, and was the first big success for K\u0159\u00ed\u017eek. The following year, Citron won the [[Zlat\u00fd slav\u00edk]] award. Citron went on to tour extensively, not only in Czechoslovakia, but also in Poland, the USSR, and Germany. They appeared frequently on television, topped music charts, and garnered much success during this period. In early 1989, the band began to prepare their next studio album, ''Vypus\u0165te psy!'' (Release the Dogs!), but disagreements began to show among them. They managed to record a demo and release two singles, before K\u0159\u00ed\u017eek departed the band in August 1989. Guitarist Jaroslav Barto\u0148 followed, and together they formed the group [[Kreyson]].\n\n===Kreyson and solo work===\n{{further|Kreyson}}\n[[File:Kreyson.jpg|thumb|Ladislav K\u0159\u00ed\u017eek and Kreyson, 1990]]\nIn 1989, Ladislav K\u0159\u00ed\u017eek collaborated with [[Karel Svoboda (composer)|Karel Svoboda]] on the title song for the well-known television series ''Dlouh\u00e1 m\u00edle''. In the same year, he founded his own band, Kreyson, together with Jaroslav Barto\u0148 from Citron. In 1990, Kreyson released their first album, titled ''And\u011bl na \u00fat\u011bku'' (Angel on the Run). The album was recorded in both Czech and English versions with the help of producer Jan N\u011bmec. The single \"Vzd\u00e1len\u00e1\" (Far Away) proved to be a huge success, topping all domestic charts, and the band went on tour for the rest of the year. In 1990, K\u0159\u00ed\u017eek released his first solo record, titled ''Zlatej chlapec'' (Golden Boy), which was also a big success and sold 100,000 copies within 14 days. K\u0159\u00ed\u017eek won his second gold record. In the following years, Kreyson released the albums ''K\u0159i\u017e\u00e1ci'' (Crusaders), ''Elix\u00edr \u017divota'' (Elixir of Life), and ''Z\u00e1kon D\u017eungle'' (Law of the Jungle). Just like ''And\u011bl na \u00fat\u011bku'', ''K\u0159i\u017e\u00e1ci'' came out both in Czech and in English. In 1993, K\u0159\u00ed\u017eek released another solo album, titled ''Kl\u00ed\u010d k m\u00e9 du\u0161i'' (The Key to My Soul), which received Diamond certification the following year for 400,000 copies sold. 1994 also saw the release of ''Best of L\u00e1\u010fa K\u0159\u00ed\u017eek'', the artist's first compilation album. Towards the end of that year, K\u0159\u00ed\u017eek sang a duet with internationally-renowned Czech opera diva [[Eva Urbanov\u00e1]] in a rock adaptation of ''[[The Phantom of the Opera]]''.

The real beginning of his career happened with the [[Prague]] band TAM. K\u0159\u00ed\u017eek did not stay with them for long, however. In the first months of 1985, TAM was offered an opening slot for the annual concert of the band Orient, which they accepted without hesitation. Coincidentally, this concert was attended by members of the heavy metal band [[Vitacit]], whose lead singer Dan Horyna departed in February of the same year. Vitacit liked K\u0159\u00ed\u017eek's vocals so much that they immediately offered him the vacant spot, which he accepted.\n\n===Vitacit===\nVitacit had been together since 1973, but had never recorded any material. In 1985, after K\u0159\u00ed\u017eek joined, they met guitarist and singer [[Milo\u0161 \"Dodo\" Dole\u017eal]], who became the band's new frontman. K\u0159\u00ed\u017eek and Dole\u017eal went on to write a number of hit songs together.\nVitacit had much success and filled concert halls throughout 1985 and 1986. By 1987, they began to attract attention from record labels, and received several offers. In January of that year, however, Ladislav K\u0159\u00ed\u017eek announced his departure from the band. His last concerts with Vitacit were held in a grim atmosphere, and on 15 March 1987, K\u0159\u00ed\u017eek and Vitacit performed together for the last time.\n\n===Citron===\nIn February 1987, the [[Ostrava]]-based metal band [[Citron (band)|Citron]] was hit by an unexpected event. Their singer Stanislav Hranick\u00fd broke his leg and was unable to perform for an extended period of time. For this reason, the band hired Ladislav K\u0159\u00ed\u017eek as his replacement. They immediately began to work on their third album, titled ''Radegast''. Upon release, the album went gold, and was the first big success for K\u0159\u00ed\u017eek. The following year, Citron won the [[Zlat\u00fd slav\u00edk]] award. Citron went on to tour extensively, not only in Czechoslovakia, but also in Poland, the USSR, and Germany. They appeared frequently on television, topped music charts, and garnered much success during this period. In early 1989, the band began to prepare their next studio album, ''Vypus\u0165te psy!'' (Release the Dogs!), but disagreements began to show among them. They managed to record a demo and release two singles, before K\u0159\u00ed\u017eek departed the band in August 1989. Guitarist Jaroslav Barto\u0148 followed, and together they formed the group [[Kreyson]].\n\n===Kreyson and solo work===\n{{further|Kreyson}}\n[[File:Kreyson.jpg|thumb|Ladislav K\u0159\u00ed\u017eek and Kreyson, 1990]]\nIn 1989, Ladislav K\u0159\u00ed\u017eek collaborated with [[Karel Svoboda (composer)|Karel Svoboda]] on the title song for the well-known television series ''Dlouh\u00e1 m\u00edle''. In the same year, he founded his own band, Kreyson, together with Jaroslav Barto\u0148 from Citron. In 1990, Kreyson released their first album, titled ''And\u011bl na \u00fat\u011bku'' (Angel on the Run). The album was recorded in both Czech and English versions with the help of producer Jan N\u011bmec. The single \"Vzd\u00e1len\u00e1\" (Far Away) proved to be a huge success, topping all domestic charts, and the band went on tour for the rest of the year. In 1990, K\u0159\u00ed\u017eek released his first solo record, titled ''Zlatej chlapec'' (Golden Boy), which was also a big success and sold 100,000 copies within 14 days. K\u0159\u00ed\u017eek won his second gold record. In the following years, Kreyson released the albums ''K\u0159i\u017e\u00e1ci'' (Crusaders), ''Elix\u00edr \u017divota'' (Elixir of Life), and ''Z\u00e1kon D\u017eungle'' (Law of the Jungle). Just like ''And\u011bl na \u00fat\u011bku'', ''K\u0159i\u017e\u00e1ci'' came out both in Czech and in English. In 1993, K\u0159\u00ed\u017eek released another solo album, titled ''Kl\u00ed\u010d k m\u00e9 du\u0161i'' (The Key to My Soul), which received Diamond certification the following year for 400,000 copies sold. 1994 also saw the release of ''Best of L\u00e1\u010fa K\u0159\u00ed\u017eek'', the artist's first compilation album. Towards the end of that year, K\u0159\u00ed\u017eek sang a duet with internationally-renowned Czech opera diva [[Eva Urbanov\u00e1]] in a rock adaptation of ''[[The Phantom of the Opera]]''. In 1995, K\u0159\u00ed\u017eek was voted among the top three most popular singers in the nation. The same year, he sang the intro song to the cartoon ''O Malence'' together with Slovak singer [[Dara Rolins]].\nIn 1996, the holiday album ''Kam hv\u011bzdy chod\u00ed sp\u00e1t'' (Where the Stars Go to Sleep) was released in collaboration with the [[Bambini di Praga]] youth choir. The album also included a duet with crooner [[Karel Gott]] on the song \"Panis Angelicus\".\n\n===Damiens and other projects===\nIn 1997, K\u0159\u00ed\u017eek recorded an album titled ''V\u0161em L\u00e1sk\u00e1m'' with violin virtuoso [[Jaroslav Sv\u011bcen\u00fd]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Ladislav Krizek & Jaroslav Sveceny |url=https://www.velkykosik.cz/hudba/vsem-laskam/ |website=velkykosik.cz |date= |accessdate=18 April 2020 |language=cs}}</ref>\nAt the end of the year, he launched the group Damiens with his brother Miroslav K\u0159\u00ed\u017eek.

When no respirators are left, workers who are at higher risk for severe illness may be excluded from caring for patients, and workers who have clinically recovered from COVID-19 may be preferred to care for patients.  Portable fans with [[HEPA]] filters may also be used to increase ventilation in isolation rooms when surgical masks are being used in place of respirators.

KONDI Technique is used for weft through inserting 3 shuttles (\u0c32\u0c3e\u0c33\u0c3f).\n* Pallau portion-Design: \"TOPE TENI SERAGU\" Normally in tope teni seragu 3 solid portions would be in red colour, and in between 2 portions in white colour.\n* Tope Teni seragu has been regarded as a state symbol and was greatly respected during festival occasions.\n* Traditional Borders: (i) Chikki, (ii) Gomi, (iii) Jari and (iv) Gadidadi, and modern Gayathri are unique ones in Ilkal saris - width ranging from 2.5\" to 4\"\n* Border Colour Uniqueness: Red usually or Maroon dominates.\n\n==Description==\n\nThe peculiar characteristic of the sari is joining the body warp with the pallu warp which is locally called as TOPE TENI. This technique is used exclusively at Ilkal. If anyone requires Ilkal sari one must prepare a warp for every sari. Warp threads for body are prepared separately. Similarly pallu warp is prepared separately either with art silk or pure silk depending upon the quality required. Thirdly border portion of warp is prepared, like the pallu warp, either art silk or pure silk and the colour used for pallu and on border will be one and the same. In general, the length of the pallu will range 16\" to 27\". The pallu threads and body threads are joined in loop technique, a unique method locally called TOPE TENI.\n\n==Features==\nThe distinctive feature of Ilkal saris is the use of a form of embroidery called [[Kasuti]]. The designs used in Kasuti reflect traditional patterns like palanquins, elephants and lotuses which are embroidered onto Ilkal saris. These saris are usually 9 yards in length and the ''pallu'' of the Ilkal sari (the part worn over the shoulder) carries designs of temple towers.<ref name=\"story\" /> This pallu is usually made of red silk with white patterns.<ref name=\"ilkal\" /> The end region of the pallu is made up of patterns of different shapes like ''hanige'' (comb), ''koti kammli'' (fort ramparts), ''toputenne'' (jowar) and ''rampa'' (mountain range). The border of the sari is very broad (4 to 6&nbsp;inches) and red or maroon in colour and is made of different designs with ochre patterns. The sari is either made of cotton, or a mixture of cotton and silk or in pure silk. The colors traditionally used are pomegranate red, brilliant peacock green and parrot green. The saris that are made for bridal wear are made of a particular colour called ''Giri Kumukum'' which is associated with the [[sindhoor]] worn by the wives of the priests in this region.<ref name=\"ilkal\" />\n\n'''Types of Borders'''\n\nThe design woven in the length wise borders are mainly three\ntypes:\n* Gomi (more popularly known as Ilkal dadi)\n* Paraspet (Sub-divided into chikki paras and dodd paras)\n* Gaadi\n* Jari\n\n'''Main Body design'''\n\n*Stripes\n*Rectangles\n*Squares\n\n'''Other Differences'''\n\nWith above broad parameters the Ilkal saris differ in matters of size, nature and quality of yarn used for different portion of sari as also colour combination and combinations of designs on the borders and main body of the sari. The beauty of Tope-teni seragu is further enhanced at times by weaving in its middle portion, yet another design known as \u2018Kyadgi\u2019.\n\n==Production==\n\nWeaving of Ilkal saris is mostly an indoor activity. It is essentially a household enterprise involving active participation of female members. To weave one sari with the help of the handloom, it takes about 7 days. We can weave it with the help of the powerloom also.\n\n==Methods of Production==\n\nIlkal traditional saris are produced mainly on pit looms with the combination of three types of different yarns namely Silk x Silk, Silk x Cotton, Art silk x Cotton. Along with the above said yarn combination totally four different traditional designs are produced - they are Chikki\nParas, Gomi, Jari and recently modified traditional design Gayathri.\n\nThese saris are produced in different lengths 6.00 yards, 8.00 yards, and 9.00 yards with solid as well as contrast borders.\n\nThe main distinction in these saris is its attached temple type Pallav (locally called as TOPE TENI) by inter locking body warp and pallav warp using loop system and inserting weft by three shuttles using two different colours yarn by Kondi technique.\n\nA weaver requires apart from himself two others for preparatory work.\n\n==See also==\n*[[Bidriware]]\n*[[Byadagi chilli]]\n*[[Mysore Sandal Soap]]\n*[[Navalgund Durries]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{commons category|Ilkal sari}}\n{{Sari}}\n{{Karnataka topics}}\n\n[[Category:Culture of Karnataka]]\n[[Category:Saris]]\n[[Category:Geographical indications in Karnataka]]\n[[Category:Cotton industry in India]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=January 2020}}\n{{Use Indian English|date=January 2020}}\n{{Expand language|langcode=kn|date=April 2019}}[[File:Weaving ilkal saree.jpg|thumb|Weaving Ilkal sari]]\n\n[[File:Indian woman fruit vendor.jpg|thumb|Indian women fruit vendor]]\n\n'''Ilkal sari''' is a traditional form of ''[[sari]]'' which is a common feminine wear in [[India]].

It was sponsored by the ''[[Daily Mail]]''{{'}}s [[Lord Northcliffe]] and featured the famous Australian soprano [[Nellie Melba|Dame Nellie Melba]]. The Melba broadcast caught the people's imagination and marked a turning point in the British public's attitude to radio.<ref>Asa Briggs, ''BBC'' p. 47</ref>  However, this public enthusiasm was not shared in official circles where such broadcasts were held to interfere with important military and civil communications. By late 1920, pressure from these quarters and uneasiness among the staff of the licensing authority, the [[General Post Office]] (GPO), was sufficient to lead to a ban on further Chelmsford broadcasts.<ref>Asa Briggs, p. 50</ref>\n\nBut by 1922, the GPO had received nearly 100 broadcast licence requests<ref>Curran and [[Jean Seaton]], ''[[Power Without Responsibility]]'', (Routledge) p. 110</ref> and moved to rescind its ban in the wake of a petition by 63 wireless societies with over 3,000 members.<ref>Asa Briggs, pp. 50, 97</ref> Anxious to avoid the same chaotic expansion experienced in the United States, the GPO proposed that it would issue a single broadcasting licence to a company jointly owned by a consortium of leading wireless receiver manufacturers, to be known as the [[British Broadcasting Company|British Broadcasting Company Ltd.]] [[John Reith, 1st Baron Reith|John Reith]], a Scottish Calvinist, was appointed its General Manager in December 1922 a few weeks after the company made its first official broadcast.<ref>supra Curran and Seaton, p. 110</ref> [[L.

Set sales were disappointing as amateurs made their own receivers and listeners bought rival unlicensed sets.<ref>supra Asa Briggs, p. 146</ref> By mid-1923, discussions between the GPO and the BBC had become deadlocked and the Postmaster-General commissioned a review of broadcasting by the [[Sykes Committee]]. The Committee recommended a short term reorganisation of licence fees with improved enforcement in order to address the BBC's immediate financial distress, and an increased share of the licence revenue split between it and the GPO. This was to be followed by a simple 10 shillings licence fee with no royalty once the wireless manufacturers' protection expired. The BBC's broadcasting monopoly was made explicit for the duration of its current broadcast licence, as was the prohibition on advertising. The BBC was also banned from presenting news bulletins before 19:00 and was required to source all news from external wire services.\n\nMid-1925 found the future of broadcasting under further consideration, this time by the Crawford committee.  By now, the BBC, under Reith's leadership, had forged a consensus favouring a continuation of the unified (monopoly) broadcasting service, but more money was still required to finance rapid expansion. Wireless manufacturers were anxious to exit the loss making consortium with Reith keen that the BBC be seen as a public service rather than a commercial enterprise. The recommendations of the Crawford Committee were published in March the following year and were still under consideration by the GPO when the [[1926 general strike]] broke out in May. The strike temporarily interrupted newspaper production, and with restrictions on news bulletins waived, the BBC suddenly became the primary source of news for the duration of the crisis.<ref name=\"supra Curran and Seaton, p. 117\">supra Curran and Seaton, p. 117</ref>\n\nThe crisis placed the BBC in a delicate position. On one hand Reith was acutely aware that the government might exercise its right to commandeer the BBC at any time as a mouthpiece of the government if the BBC were to step out of line, but on the other he was anxious to maintain public trust by appearing to be acting independently. The government was divided on how to handle the BBC but ended up trusting Reith, whose opposition to the strike mirrored the PM's own. Thus the BBC was granted sufficient leeway to pursue the government's objectives largely in a manner of its own choosing. The resulting coverage of both striker and government viewpoints impressed millions of listeners who were unaware that the PM had broadcast to the nation from Reith's home, using one of Reith's sound bites inserted at the last moment, or that the BBC had banned broadcasts from the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] and delayed a peace appeal by the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]. Supporters of the strike nicknamed the BBC the BFC for British Falsehood Company. Reith personally announced the end of the strike which he marked by reciting from Blake's \"[[And did those feet in ancient time|Jerusalem]]\" signifying that England had been saved.<ref>Crook, Tim (2002). \"International Radio Journalism\". Routledge.</ref>\n\nWhile the BBC tends to characterise its coverage of the general strike by emphasising the positive impression created by its balanced coverage of the views of government and strikers, [[Jean Seaton]], Professor of Media History and the Official BBC Historian, has characterised the episode as the invention of \"modern propaganda in its British form\".<ref name=\"supra Curran and Seaton, p. 117\"/> Reith argued that trust gained by 'authentic impartial news' could then be used. Impartial news was not necessarily an end in itself.<ref>supra Curran and Seaton, p. 118</ref>\n\nThe BBC did well out of the crisis, which cemented a national audience for its broadcasting, and it was followed by the Government's acceptance of the recommendation made by the Crawford Committee (1925\u201326) that the British Broadcasting Company be replaced by a non-commercial, Crown-chartered organisation: the British Broadcasting Corporation.\n\n===1927 to 1939===\n[[File:Radio Times 1931 (masthead).jpg|thumb|left|Masthead from the edition of 25 December 1931 of the ''[[Radio Times]]'', including the BBC motto \"Nation shall speak peace unto Nation\"]]\n[[File:John Logie Baird in 1917.jpg|thumb|right|Television pioneer [[John Logie Baird]] (seen here in 1917) televised the BBC's first drama, ''[[The Man with the Flower in His Mouth]]'', on 14 July 1930, and the first live outside broadcast, [[Epsom Derby|The Derby]], on 2 June 1931.<ref>{{cite news|title=The Man with the Flower in his Mouth|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p02d2sm7|publisher=BBC|date=9 October 2017|access-date=20 December 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181021180342/https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p02d2sm7|archive-date=21 October 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=BBC's first television outside broadcast|url=http://www.bbceng.info/additions/2016/first-scanner-prospero-2010a.pdf|publisher=Prospero|access-date=9 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171009223351/http://www.bbceng.info/additions/2016/first-scanner-prospero-2010a.pdf|archive-date=9 October 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>]]\n\nThe British Broadcasting Corporation came into existence on 1 January 1927, and Reith \u2013 newly knighted \u2013 was appointed its first Director General.

By 1929, the BBC complained that the agents of many comedians refused to sign contracts for broadcasting, because they feared it harmed the artist \"by making his material stale\" and that it \"reduces the value of the artist as a visible music-hall performer\". On the other hand, the BBC was \"keenly interested\" in a cooperation with the recording companies who \"in recent years&nbsp;... have not been slow to make records of singers, orchestras, dance bands, etc. who have already proved their power to achieve popularity by wireless.\" Radio plays were so popular that the BBC had received 6,000 manuscripts by 1929, most of them written for stage and of little value for broadcasting: \"Day in and day out, manuscripts come in, and nearly all go out again through the post, with a note saying 'We regret, etc.'\"<ref>''BBC Hand Book'' (1929), pp. 164, 182, 186</ref> In the 1930s music broadcasts also enjoyed great popularity, for example the friendly and wide-ranging organ broadcasts at St George's Hall, Langham Place, by [[Reginald Foort]], who held the official role of BBC Staff Theatre Organist from 1936 to 1938; Foort continued to work for the BBC as a freelance into the 1940s and enjoyed a nationwide following.\n\nExperimental television broadcasts were started in 1930, using an electromechanical 30-line system developed by [[John Logie Baird]].

As a result of the [[Pilkington Committee on Broadcasting|Pilkington Committee]] report of 1962, in which the BBC was praised for the quality and range of its output, and ITV was very heavily criticised for not providing enough quality programming,<ref>{{cite web|title=Committees of Enquiry: Pilkington Committee |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/heritage/more/pdfs/committees_of_enquiry.pdf |page=4 |date=1 June 1962 |accessdate=30 September 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061012060952/http://www.bbc.co.uk/heritage/more/pdfs/committees_of_enquiry.pdf |archivedate=12 October 2006 |url-status=live  }}</ref> the decision was taken to award the BBC a second television channel, [[BBC Two|BBC2]], in 1964, renaming the existing service [[BBC1]]. BBC2 used the higher resolution 625 line standard which had been standardised across Europe. BBC2 was broadcast in colour from 1 July 1967, and was joined by BBC1 and ITV on 15 November 1969. The 405 line [[Vhf#United Kingdom|VHF]] transmissions of BBC1 (and ITV) were continued for compatibility with older television receivers until 1985.\n[[File:BBC TV Centre.jpg|thumb|left|[[BBC Television Centre]] at [[White City, London|White City]], West London, which opened in 1960 and closed in 2013.]]\n\nStarting in 1964, a series of [[pirate radio]] stations (starting with [[Radio Caroline]]) came on the air and forced the British government finally to regulate radio services to permit nationally based advertising-financed services. In response, the BBC reorganised and renamed their radio channels.

In the late 1980s, the BBC began a process of [[divestment]] by [[Corporate spin-off|spinning off]] and selling parts of its organisation. In 1988, it sold off the [[Hulton Press Library]], a photographic archive which had been acquired from the ''[[Picture Post]]'' magazine by the BBC in 1957. The archive was sold to Brian Deutsch and is now owned by [[Getty Images]].<ref name=hulton-history>{{cite web|last=McDonald|first=Sarah|title=15/10/04 \u00a9 Sarah McDonald, Curator Page 1 10/15/04 Hulton{{!}}Archive \u2013 History In Pictures|url=http://corporate.gettyimages.com/masters2/conservation/articles/HAHistory.pdf|publisher=Getty Images|accessdate=28 May 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130527044717/http://corporate.gettyimages.com/masters2/conservation/articles/HAHistory.pdf|archive-date=27 May 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>  During the 1990s, this process continued with the separation of certain operational arms of the corporation into autonomous but [[subsidiary|wholly owned subsidiaries]] of the BBC, with the aim of generating additional revenue for programme-making. BBC Enterprises was reorganised and relaunched in 1995, as BBC Worldwide Ltd.<ref name=\"briggs\"/> In 1998, BBC studios, outside broadcasts, post production, design, costumes and wigs were spun off into BBC Resources Ltd.<ref name=guardian-resources>{{cite news|last=Holmwood|first=Leigh|title=BBC Resources sell-off to begin|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/aug/15/bbc.television|accessdate=28 May 2013|date=15 August 2007|location=London|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203153604/http://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/aug/15/bbc.television|archive-date=3 December 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe [[BBC Research Department]] has played a major part in the development of broadcasting and recording techniques.  The BBC was also responsible for the development of the [[NICAM]] stereo standard. In recent decades, a number of additional channels and radio stations have been launched: [[BBC Radio 5 (former)|Radio 5]] was launched in 1990, as a sports and educational station, but was replaced in 1994, with [[BBC Radio 5 Live|Radio 5 Live]] to become a live radio station, following the success of the [[BBC Radio 4 News FM|Radio 4 service]] to cover the 1991 Gulf War. The new station would be a news and sport station. In 1997, [[BBC News 24]], a rolling news channel, launched on [[digital television]] services and the following year, [[BBC Choice]] launched as the third general entertainment channel from the BBC. The BBC also purchased The Parliamentary Channel, which was renamed [[BBC Parliament]]. In 1999, [[BBC Knowledge]] launched as a multi media channel, with services available on the newly launched [[BBC Red Button|BBC Text]] digital teletext service, and on [[BBC Online]]. The channel had an educational aim, which was modified later on in its life to offer documentaries.\n\n===2000 to 2011===\nIn 2002, several television and radio channels were reorganised. [[BBC Knowledge]] was replaced by [[BBC Four]] and became the BBC's arts and documentaries channel. [[CBBC]], which had been a programming strand as Children's BBC since 1985, was split into CBBC and [[CBeebies]], for younger children, with both new services getting a digital channel: the [[CBBC Channel]] and [[CBeebies]] Channel. In addition to the television channels, new digital radio stations were created: [[BBC Radio 1Xtra|1Xtra]], [[BBC Radio 6 Music|6 Music]] and [[BBC Radio 4 Extra|BBC7]]. [[BBC Radio 1Xtra|BBC 1Xtra]] was a sister station to [[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1]] and specialised in modern black music, [[BBC Radio 6 Music|BBC 6 Music]] specialised in alternative music genres and [[BBC Radio 4 Extra|BBC7]] specialised in archive, speech and children's programming.\n\n[[File:Manchester big screen.jpg|thumb|left|England fans in [[Manchester]] during a [[2006 FIFA World Cup]] game shown on the [[BBC Big Screen]]]]\nThe following few years resulted in repositioning of some of the channels to conform to a larger brand: in 2003, [[BBC Choice]] was replaced by [[BBC Three]], with programming for younger generations and shocking real life documentaries, BBC News 24 became the [[BBC News Channel]] in 2008, and BBC Radio 7 became [[BBC Radio 4 Extra]] in 2011, with new programmes to supplement those broadcast on [[BBC Radio 4|Radio 4]].

Of the ten national stations, five are major stations and are available on [[FM broadcasting|FM]] and/or [[AM broadcasting|AM]] as well as on [[Digital radio in the United Kingdom|DAB]] and online. These are [[BBC Radio 1]], offering new music and popular styles and being notable for its chart show; [[BBC Radio 2]], playing [[Adult contemporary music|Adult contemporary]], country and soul music amongst many other genres; [[BBC Radio 3]], presenting classical and jazz music together with some spoken-word programming of a cultural nature in the evenings; [[BBC Radio 4]], focusing on current affairs, factual and other speech-based programming, including drama and comedy; and [[BBC Radio 5 Live]], broadcasting 24-hour news, sport and talk programmes.\n\nIn addition to these five stations, the BBC runs a further five stations that broadcast on DAB and online only. These stations supplement and expand on the big five stations, and were launched in 2002. [[BBC Radio 1Xtra]] sisters Radio 1, and broadcasts new black music and urban tracks. [[BBC Radio 5 Live Sports Extra]] sisters 5 Live and offers extra sport analysis, including broadcasting sports that previously were not covered. [[BBC Radio 6 Music]] offers alternative music genres and is notable as a platform for new artists.\n\n[[BBC Radio 7]], later renamed [[BBC Radio 4 Extra]], provided archive drama, comedy and children's programming. Following the change to Radio 4 Extra, the service has dropped a defined children's strand in favour of family-friendly drama and comedy. In addition, new programmes to complement Radio 4 programmes were introduced such as ''[[Ambridge Extra]]'', and ''Desert Island Discs revisited''. The final station is the [[BBC Asian Network]], providing music, talk and news to this section of the community. This station evolved out of Local radio stations serving certain areas, and as such this station is available on [[Medium Wave]] frequency in some areas of the Midlands.\n\nAs well as the national stations, the BBC also provides 40 [[BBC Local Radio]] stations in England and the Channel Islands, each named for and covering a particular city and its surrounding area (e.g. [[BBC Radio Bristol]]), county or region (e.g. [[BBC Three Counties Radio]]), or geographical area (e.g. [[BBC Radio Solent]] covering the central south coast). A further six stations broadcast in what the BBC terms \"the national regions\": Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. These are [[BBC Radio Wales]] (in English), [[BBC Radio Cymru]] (in [[Welsh language|Welsh]]), [[BBC Radio Scotland]] (in English), [[BBC Radio nan Gaidheal]] (in [[Scottish Gaelic language|Scottish Gaelic]]), [[BBC Radio Ulster]], and [[BBC Radio Foyle]], the latter being an opt-out station from Radio Ulster for the north-west of Northern Ireland.\n\nThe BBC's UK national channels are also broadcast in the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man (although these [[Crown dependencies]] are outside the UK), and in the former there are two local stations \u2013 [[BBC Guernsey]] and [[BBC Radio Jersey]]. There is no BBC local radio station, however, in the Isle of Man, partly because the island has long been served by the popular independent commercial station, [[Manx Radio]], which predates the existence of BBC Local Radio. BBC services in the dependencies are financed from [[television licence]] fees which are set at the same level as those payable in the UK, although collected locally. This is the subject of some controversy in the Isle of Man since, as well as having no BBC Local Radio service, the island also lacks a local television news service analogous to that provided by [[BBC Channel Islands News|BBC Channel Islands]].<ref>{{cite web |author= |url=http://www.iomtoday.co.im/news/isle-of-man-news/tv-licence-fee-not-value-for-money-inquiry-hears-1-3053173 |title=TV licence fee not value for money \u2013 inquiry hears |publisher=Iomtoday.co.im |date=8 February 2011 |accessdate=1 January 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121221125549/http://www.iomtoday.co.im/news/isle-of-man-news/tv-licence-fee-not-value-for-money-inquiry-hears-1-3053173 |archivedate=21 December 2012  }}</ref>\n[[File:BBC World Questions - Hungary.jpg|thumb|BBC World Service \u2013 Jonathan Dimbleby broadcasting from Budapest]]\nFor a worldwide audience, the [[BBC World Service]] provides news, current affairs and information in 28 languages, including English, around the world and is available in over 150 capital cities.

Unlike [[Ceefax]], the service's analogue counterpart, BBC Red Button is able to display full-colour graphics, photographs, and video, as well as programmes and can be accessed from any BBC channel. The service carries News, Weather and Sport 24 hours a day, but also provides extra features related to programmes specific at that time. Examples include viewers to play along at home to gameshows, to give, voice and vote on opinions to issues, as used alongside programmes such as ''[[Question Time (TV series)|Question Time]]''. At some points in the year, when multiple sporting events occur, some coverage of less mainstream sports or games are frequently placed on the Red Button for viewers to watch. Frequently, other features are added unrelated to programmes being broadcast at that time, such as the broadcast of the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' animated episode ''[[Dreamland (Doctor Who)|Dreamland]]'' in November 2009.\n\n===Music===\n[[File:BBC Big Band - Town Hall Birmingham - May 2012.jpg|thumb|The [[BBC Big Band]] ]]\nThe BBC employs 5 staff orchestras, a professional choir, and supports two amateur choruses, based in BBC venues across the UK;<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/orchestras|title=BBC Orchestras and Choirs|website=BBC Music Events|language=en|access-date=2019-10-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191014201823/https://www.bbc.co.uk/orchestras|archive-date=14 October 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> the [[BBC Symphony Orchestra]], the [[BBC Singers]] and [[BBC Symphony Chorus]] based in London, the [[BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra]] in Glasgow, the [[BBC Philharmonic]] in Salford, the [[BBC Concert Orchestra]] based in Watford, and the [[BBC National Orchestra of Wales]] and [[BBC National Chorus of Wales]] in Cardiff.

In addition to broadcasting output on television and radio, some programmes are also displayed on the [[BBC Big Screen]]s located in several central-city locations. The BBC and the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]] also jointly run [[BBC Monitoring]], which monitors radio, television, the press and the internet worldwide.

Set sales were disappointing as amateurs made their own receivers and listeners bought rival unlicensed sets.<ref>supra Asa Briggs, p. 146</ref> By mid-1923, discussions between the GPO and the BBC had become deadlocked and the Postmaster-General commissioned a review of broadcasting by the [[Sykes Committee]]. The Committee recommended a short term reorganisation of licence fees with improved enforcement in order to address the BBC's immediate financial distress, and an increased share of the licence revenue split between it and the GPO. This was to be followed by a simple 10 shillings licence fee with no royalty once the wireless manufacturers' protection expired. The BBC's broadcasting monopoly was made explicit for the duration of its current broadcast licence, as was the prohibition on advertising. The BBC was also banned from presenting news bulletins before 19:00 and was required to source all news from external wire services.\n\nMid-1925 found the future of broadcasting under further consideration, this time by the Crawford committee.  By now, the BBC, under Reith's leadership, had forged a consensus favouring a continuation of the unified (monopoly) broadcasting service, but more money was still required to finance rapid expansion. Wireless manufacturers were anxious to exit the loss making consortium with Reith keen that the BBC be seen as a public service rather than a commercial enterprise. The recommendations of the Crawford Committee were published in March the following year and were still under consideration by the GPO when the [[1926 general strike]] broke out in May. The strike temporarily interrupted newspaper production, and with restrictions on news bulletins waived, the BBC suddenly became the primary source of news for the duration of the crisis.<ref name=\"supra Curran and Seaton, p. 117\">supra Curran and Seaton, p. 117</ref>\n\nThe crisis placed the BBC in a delicate position. On one hand Reith was acutely aware that the government might exercise its right to commandeer the BBC at any time as a mouthpiece of the government if the BBC were to step out of line, but on the other he was anxious to maintain public trust by appearing to be acting independently. The government was divided on how to handle the BBC but ended up trusting Reith, whose opposition to the strike mirrored the PM's own. Thus the BBC was granted sufficient leeway to pursue the government's objectives largely in a manner of its own choosing. The resulting coverage of both striker and government viewpoints impressed millions of listeners who were unaware that the PM had broadcast to the nation from Reith's home, using one of Reith's sound bites inserted at the last moment, or that the BBC had banned broadcasts from the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] and delayed a peace appeal by the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]. Supporters of the strike nicknamed the BBC the BFC for British Falsehood Company. Reith personally announced the end of the strike which he marked by reciting from Blake's \"[[And did those feet in ancient time|Jerusalem]]\" signifying that England had been saved.<ref>Crook, Tim (2002). \"International Radio Journalism\". Routledge.</ref>\n\nWhile the BBC tends to characterise its coverage of the general strike by emphasising the positive impression created by its balanced coverage of the views of government and strikers, [[Jean Seaton]], Professor of Media History and the Official BBC Historian, has characterised the episode as the invention of \"modern propaganda in its British form\".<ref name=\"supra Curran and Seaton, p. 117\"/> Reith argued that trust gained by 'authentic impartial news' could then be used. Impartial news was not necessarily an end in itself.<ref>supra Curran and Seaton, p. 118</ref>\n\nThe BBC did well out of the crisis, which cemented a national audience for its broadcasting, and it was followed by the Government's acceptance of the recommendation made by the Crawford Committee (1925\u201326) that the British Broadcasting Company be replaced by a non-commercial, Crown-chartered organisation: the British Broadcasting Corporation.\n\n===1927 to 1939===\n[[File:Radio Times 1931 (masthead).jpg|thumb|left|Masthead from the edition of 25 December 1931 of the ''[[Radio Times]]'', including the BBC motto \"Nation shall speak peace unto Nation\"]]\n[[File:John Logie Baird in 1917.jpg|thumb|right|Television pioneer [[John Logie Baird]] (seen here in 1917) televised the BBC's first drama, ''[[The Man with the Flower in His Mouth]]'', on 14 July 1930, and the first live outside broadcast, [[Epsom Derby|The Derby]], on 2 June 1931.<ref>{{cite news|title=The Man with the Flower in his Mouth|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p02d2sm7|publisher=BBC|date=9 October 2017|access-date=20 December 2019|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181021180342/https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p02d2sm7|archive-date=21 October 2018|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=BBC's first television outside broadcast|url=http://www.bbceng.info/additions/2016/first-scanner-prospero-2010a.pdf|publisher=Prospero|access-date=9 October 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171009223351/http://www.bbceng.info/additions/2016/first-scanner-prospero-2010a.pdf|archive-date=9 October 2017|url-status=live}}</ref>]]\n\nThe British Broadcasting Corporation came into existence on 1 January 1927, and Reith \u2013 newly knighted \u2013 was appointed its first Director General.

By 1929, the BBC complained that the agents of many comedians refused to sign contracts for broadcasting, because they feared it harmed the artist \"by making his material stale\" and that it \"reduces the value of the artist as a visible music-hall performer\". On the other hand, the BBC was \"keenly interested\" in a cooperation with the recording companies who \"in recent years&nbsp;... have not been slow to make records of singers, orchestras, dance bands, etc. who have already proved their power to achieve popularity by wireless.\" Radio plays were so popular that the BBC had received 6,000 manuscripts by 1929, most of them written for stage and of little value for broadcasting: \"Day in and day out, manuscripts come in, and nearly all go out again through the post, with a note saying 'We regret, etc.'\"<ref>''BBC Hand Book'' (1929), pp. 164, 182, 186</ref> In the 1930s music broadcasts also enjoyed great popularity, for example the friendly and wide-ranging organ broadcasts at St George's Hall, Langham Place, by [[Reginald Foort]], who held the official role of BBC Staff Theatre Organist from 1936 to 1938; Foort continued to work for the BBC as a freelance into the 1940s and enjoyed a nationwide following.\n\nExperimental television broadcasts were started in 1930, using an electromechanical 30-line system developed by [[John Logie Baird]].

In the late 1980s, the BBC began a process of [[divestment]] by [[Corporate spin-off|spinning off]] and selling parts of its organisation. In 1988, it sold off the [[Hulton Press Library]], a photographic archive which had been acquired from the ''[[Picture Post]]'' magazine by the BBC in 1957. The archive was sold to Brian Deutsch and is now owned by [[Getty Images]].<ref name=hulton-history>{{cite web|last=McDonald|first=Sarah|title=15/10/04 \u00a9 Sarah McDonald, Curator Page 1 10/15/04 Hulton{{!}}Archive \u2013 History In Pictures|url=http://corporate.gettyimages.com/masters2/conservation/articles/HAHistory.pdf|publisher=Getty Images|accessdate=28 May 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130527044717/http://corporate.gettyimages.com/masters2/conservation/articles/HAHistory.pdf|archive-date=27 May 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>  During the 1990s, this process continued with the separation of certain operational arms of the corporation into autonomous but [[subsidiary|wholly owned subsidiaries]] of the BBC, with the aim of generating additional revenue for programme-making. BBC Enterprises was reorganised and relaunched in 1995, as BBC Worldwide Ltd.<ref name=\"briggs\"/> In 1998, BBC studios, outside broadcasts, post production, design, costumes and wigs were spun off into BBC Resources Ltd.<ref name=guardian-resources>{{cite news|last=Holmwood|first=Leigh|title=BBC Resources sell-off to begin|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/aug/15/bbc.television|accessdate=28 May 2013|date=15 August 2007|location=London|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203153604/http://www.theguardian.com/media/2007/aug/15/bbc.television|archive-date=3 December 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nThe [[BBC Research Department]] has played a major part in the development of broadcasting and recording techniques.  The BBC was also responsible for the development of the [[NICAM]] stereo standard. In recent decades, a number of additional channels and radio stations have been launched: [[BBC Radio 5 (former)|Radio 5]] was launched in 1990, as a sports and educational station, but was replaced in 1994, with [[BBC Radio 5 Live|Radio 5 Live]] to become a live radio station, following the success of the [[BBC Radio 4 News FM|Radio 4 service]] to cover the 1991 Gulf War. The new station would be a news and sport station. In 1997, [[BBC News 24]], a rolling news channel, launched on [[digital television]] services and the following year, [[BBC Choice]] launched as the third general entertainment channel from the BBC. The BBC also purchased The Parliamentary Channel, which was renamed [[BBC Parliament]]. In 1999, [[BBC Knowledge]] launched as a multi media channel, with services available on the newly launched [[BBC Red Button|BBC Text]] digital teletext service, and on [[BBC Online]]. The channel had an educational aim, which was modified later on in its life to offer documentaries.\n\n===2000 to 2011===\nIn 2002, several television and radio channels were reorganised. [[BBC Knowledge]] was replaced by [[BBC Four]] and became the BBC's arts and documentaries channel. [[CBBC]], which had been a programming strand as Children's BBC since 1985, was split into CBBC and [[CBeebies]], for younger children, with both new services getting a digital channel: the [[CBBC Channel]] and [[CBeebies]] Channel. In addition to the television channels, new digital radio stations were created: [[BBC Radio 1Xtra|1Xtra]], [[BBC Radio 6 Music|6 Music]] and [[BBC Radio 4 Extra|BBC7]]. [[BBC Radio 1Xtra|BBC 1Xtra]] was a sister station to [[BBC Radio 1|Radio 1]] and specialised in modern black music, [[BBC Radio 6 Music|BBC 6 Music]] specialised in alternative music genres and [[BBC Radio 4 Extra|BBC7]] specialised in archive, speech and children's programming.\n\n[[File:Manchester big screen.jpg|thumb|left|England fans in [[Manchester]] during a [[2006 FIFA World Cup]] game shown on the [[BBC Big Screen]]]]\nThe following few years resulted in repositioning of some of the channels to conform to a larger brand: in 2003, [[BBC Choice]] was replaced by [[BBC Three]], with programming for younger generations and shocking real life documentaries, BBC News 24 became the [[BBC News Channel]] in 2008, and BBC Radio 7 became [[BBC Radio 4 Extra]] in 2011, with new programmes to supplement those broadcast on [[BBC Radio 4|Radio 4]].

In 2010, an HD simulcast of BBC One launched: [[BBC One HD]]. The  channel uses HD versions of BBC One's schedule and uses upscaled versions of programmes not currently produced in HD. The BBC HD channel closed in March 2013 and was replaced by BBC2 HD in the same month.\n\nOn 18 October 2007, BBC Director General Mark Thompson announced a controversial plan to make major cuts and reduce the size of the BBC as an organisation.

Of the ten national stations, five are major stations and are available on [[FM broadcasting|FM]] and/or [[AM broadcasting|AM]] as well as on [[Digital radio in the United Kingdom|DAB]] and online. These are [[BBC Radio 1]], offering new music and popular styles and being notable for its chart show; [[BBC Radio 2]], playing [[Adult contemporary music|Adult contemporary]], country and soul music amongst many other genres; [[BBC Radio 3]], presenting classical and jazz music together with some spoken-word programming of a cultural nature in the evenings; [[BBC Radio 4]], focusing on current affairs, factual and other speech-based programming, including drama and comedy; and [[BBC Radio 5 Live]], broadcasting 24-hour news, sport and talk programmes.\n\nIn addition to these five stations, the BBC runs a further five stations that broadcast on DAB and online only. These stations supplement and expand on the big five stations, and were launched in 2002. [[BBC Radio 1Xtra]] sisters Radio 1, and broadcasts new black music and urban tracks. [[BBC Radio 5 Live Sports Extra]] sisters 5 Live and offers extra sport analysis, including broadcasting sports that previously were not covered. [[BBC Radio 6 Music]] offers alternative music genres and is notable as a platform for new artists.\n\n[[BBC Radio 7]], later renamed [[BBC Radio 4 Extra]], provided archive drama, comedy and children's programming. Following the change to Radio 4 Extra, the service has dropped a defined children's strand in favour of family-friendly drama and comedy. In addition, new programmes to complement Radio 4 programmes were introduced such as ''[[Ambridge Extra]]'', and ''Desert Island Discs revisited''. The final station is the [[BBC Asian Network]], providing music, talk and news to this section of the community. This station evolved out of Local radio stations serving certain areas, and as such this station is available on [[Medium Wave]] frequency in some areas of the Midlands.\n\nAs well as the national stations, the BBC also provides 40 [[BBC Local Radio]] stations in England and the Channel Islands, each named for and covering a particular city and its surrounding area (e.g. [[BBC Radio Bristol]]), county or region (e.g. [[BBC Three Counties Radio]]), or geographical area (e.g. [[BBC Radio Solent]] covering the central south coast). A further six stations broadcast in what the BBC terms \"the national regions\": Wales, Scotland, and Northern Ireland. These are [[BBC Radio Wales]] (in English), [[BBC Radio Cymru]] (in [[Welsh language|Welsh]]), [[BBC Radio Scotland]] (in English), [[BBC Radio nan Gaidheal]] (in [[Scottish Gaelic language|Scottish Gaelic]]), [[BBC Radio Ulster]], and [[BBC Radio Foyle]], the latter being an opt-out station from Radio Ulster for the north-west of Northern Ireland.\n\nThe BBC's UK national channels are also broadcast in the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man (although these [[Crown dependencies]] are outside the UK), and in the former there are two local stations \u2013 [[BBC Guernsey]] and [[BBC Radio Jersey]]. There is no BBC local radio station, however, in the Isle of Man, partly because the island has long been served by the popular independent commercial station, [[Manx Radio]], which predates the existence of BBC Local Radio. BBC services in the dependencies are financed from [[television licence]] fees which are set at the same level as those payable in the UK, although collected locally. This is the subject of some controversy in the Isle of Man since, as well as having no BBC Local Radio service, the island also lacks a local television news service analogous to that provided by [[BBC Channel Islands News|BBC Channel Islands]].<ref>{{cite web |author= |url=http://www.iomtoday.co.im/news/isle-of-man-news/tv-licence-fee-not-value-for-money-inquiry-hears-1-3053173 |title=TV licence fee not value for money \u2013 inquiry hears |publisher=Iomtoday.co.im |date=8 February 2011 |accessdate=1 January 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121221125549/http://www.iomtoday.co.im/news/isle-of-man-news/tv-licence-fee-not-value-for-money-inquiry-hears-1-3053173 |archivedate=21 December 2012  }}</ref>\n[[File:BBC World Questions - Hungary.jpg|thumb|BBC World Service \u2013 Jonathan Dimbleby broadcasting from Budapest]]\nFor a worldwide audience, the [[BBC World Service]] provides news, current affairs and information in 28 languages, including English, around the world and is available in over 150 capital cities.

Unlike [[Ceefax]], the service's analogue counterpart, BBC Red Button is able to display full-colour graphics, photographs, and video, as well as programmes and can be accessed from any BBC channel. The service carries News, Weather and Sport 24 hours a day, but also provides extra features related to programmes specific at that time. Examples include viewers to play along at home to gameshows, to give, voice and vote on opinions to issues, as used alongside programmes such as ''[[Question Time (TV series)|Question Time]]''. At some points in the year, when multiple sporting events occur, some coverage of less mainstream sports or games are frequently placed on the Red Button for viewers to watch. Frequently, other features are added unrelated to programmes being broadcast at that time, such as the broadcast of the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' animated episode ''[[Dreamland (Doctor Who)|Dreamland]]'' in November 2009.\n\n===Music===\n[[File:BBC Big Band - Town Hall Birmingham - May 2012.jpg|thumb|The [[BBC Big Band]] ]]\nThe BBC employs 5 staff orchestras, a professional choir, and supports two amateur choruses, based in BBC venues across the UK;<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/orchestras|title=BBC Orchestras and Choirs|website=BBC Music Events|language=en|access-date=2019-10-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20191014201823/https://www.bbc.co.uk/orchestras|archive-date=14 October 2019|url-status=live}}</ref> the [[BBC Symphony Orchestra]], the [[BBC Singers]] and [[BBC Symphony Chorus]] based in London, the [[BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra]] in Glasgow, the [[BBC Philharmonic]] in Salford, the [[BBC Concert Orchestra]] based in Watford, and the [[BBC National Orchestra of Wales]] and [[BBC National Chorus of Wales]] in Cardiff.

The BBC is also responsible for the broadcast of [[Glastonbury Festival]], [[Reading Festival]] and [[United Kingdom in the Eurovision Song Contest|United Kingdom]] coverage of the [[Eurovision Song Contest]], a show with which the broadcaster has been associated for over 60 years. The BBC also operates the division of BBC Audiobooks sometimes found in association with Chivers Audiobooks.\n\n===Other===\nThe BBC operates other ventures in addition to their broadcasting arm. In addition to broadcasting output on television and radio, some programmes are also displayed on the [[BBC Big Screen]]s located in several central-city locations. The BBC and the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]] also jointly run [[BBC Monitoring]], which monitors radio, television, the press and the internet worldwide. The BBC also developed several computers throughout the 1980s, most notably the [[BBC Micro]], which ran alongside the corporation's educational aims and programming.\n\nIn 1951, in conjunction with [[Oxford University Press]] the BBC published ''The BBC Hymn Book'' which was intended to be used by radio listeners to follow hymns being broadcast.  The book was published both with and without music, the music edition being entitled ''The BBC Hymn Book with Music''.<ref>British Broadcasting Corporation (1969) ''The BBC Hymn Book with Music''  London: Oxford University Press</ref> The book contained 542 popular hymns.\n\n===Ceefax===\n{{Main|Ceefax}}\n\nThe BBC provided the world's first teletext service called [[Ceefax]] (near-homonymous with \"See Facts\") on 23 September 1974 until 23 October 2012 on the [[BBC 1]] analogue channel then later on [[BBC 2]].

Based on materials in the Bulgarian secret police archives, the card files of the HVA, and documents from or relating to the HVA scattered among the records of other divisions of the Stasi, it has been possible to reconstruct some aspects of the Stasi's involvement in the disinformation campaign. At the beginning of September 1986, the tenth division of the HVA (HVA/X), responsible for organizing and coordinating the HVA's campaigns of [[active measures]], wrote the following in a draft plan for cooperation with Bulgarian State Security:<blockquote><u>Operation \"DENVER\"</u>.

The study had been distributed at the summit meeting of the Non-Aligned Movement in August\u2013September 1986 in a brochure entitled, \u201cAIDS: USA home-made evil, NOT out of AFRICA.\u201d<ref name=\":0\" /> The report was quoted heavily by Soviet propagandists, and the Segals were often said to be French researchers to hide their connections to communism. Although both Segals, given the double danger to them as Jews and members of the German Communist Party, had fled into exile in France in 1933, both had attained Soviet citizenship in 1940 on the basis of Jakob's birth in (then Soviet-annexed) Lithuania, and in 1953, they had returned to Germany\u2014specifically, to communist East Berlin.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.deutsche-biographie.de/gnd126674272.html|title=Segal, Jakob - Deutsche Biographie|last=Biographie|first=Deutsche|website=www.deutsche-biographie.de|language=de|access-date=2019-07-23}}</ref>\n\nIn his report, Jakob Segal postulated that the AIDS virus was synthesized by combining parts of two distantly related retroviruses: [[Visna virus|VISNA]] and [[HTLV-1]].<ref name=\"statereport\" /> An excerpt of the Segal report reads as follows:\n\n{{Quote|text=It is very easy using genetic technologies to unite two parts of completely independent viruses\u2026 but who would be interested in doing this? The military, of course\u2026 In 1977 a special top security lab\u2026 was set up\u2026at the Pentagon's central biological laboratory. One year after that\u2026 the first cases of AIDS occurred in the US, in New York City. How it occurred precisely at this moment and how the virus managed to get out of the secret, hush-hush laboratory is quite easy to understand. Everyone knows that prisoners are used for military experiments in the U.S. They are promised their freedom if they come out of the experiment alive.<ref name=statereport/>}}\n\nElsewhere in the report, Segal said that his hypothesis was based purely on assumptions, extrapolations, and hearsay and not at all on direct scientific evidence.<ref name=statereport/>\n\nThe exact relationship of both Segals to the KGB, Stasi, or both at this time\u2014to the extent that it existed\u2014remains unclear. Both publicly denied any involvement of the KGB or Stasi in their work.  The Deputy Director of HVA/X, Wolfgang Mutz, hinted that the HVA had played a role in the publication \u2013 or actually, the photocopying \u2013 and distribution of the Harare brochure in talks with Bulgarian State Security in September 1986.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.bstu.de/assets/bstu/de/Publikationen/BFi33_Selvage_AIDS.pdf|title=Die AIDS-Verschw\u00f6rung.

This office had registered a \u201csecurity dossier\u201d (''Sicherungsvorgang,'' SVG) \u201cWind\u201d on September 6, 1985, regarding the protection of East German scientists in the areas of AIDS research, genetic engineering and biotechnology from outside \u201cattacks\u201d in the form of espionage or manipulation by foreign agents. This office in HVA/SWT apparently registered both Segals in this dossier as \"contact persons\" under the codename \"Diagnosis\"; whenever other divisions of the Stasi inquired about the Segals, they were directed to this office. HVA/SWT\u2014or \"the security,\" as Jakob Segal called them\u2014gave him at least one piece of advice regarding his study before its printing and distribution. Whether Segal listened to this advice remains unclear. Still, given their official designation as \u201ccontact persons,\u201d they need not have known, at least officially, that they were dealing with the Stasi, although Jakob Segal likely knew or could have guessed, given his past dealings with both the Stasi and the KGB. It is quite possible that HVA/SWT was already coordinating with the KGB regarding Segal\u2019s research \u2013 even without his knowledge \u2013 in the second half of 1985, at the time that \u201cWind\u201d was registered.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.bstu.de/assets/bstu/de/Publikationen/BFi33_Selvage_AIDS.pdf|title=Die AIDS-Verschw\u00f6rung.

It was clearly his own work, in cooperation with his wife Lilli, although he knew and expected that it would be used for \"propaganda.\"<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.bstu.de/assets/bstu/de/Publikationen/BFi33_Selvage_AIDS.pdf|title=Die AIDS-Verschw\u00f6rung.

His articles and brochures, the KGB wrote, had attained \"great renown.\" This was especially the case in African countries, where governments and researchers were rejecting as racist assertions by U.S. researchers that AIDS had originated naturally in Africa, where it had spread from monkeys to humans.<ref name=\":3\" /> The KGB wrote the Bulgarians:<blockquote>We are currently resolving the task of bringing the [active] measures down to a more practical level, and in particular, to attain specific political results by exploiting the \u201claboratory version\u201d for AM [active measures] on other issues. So, efforts are being made to intensify anti-base sentiments in countries where American forces are deployed by using slogans suggesting that U.S. soldiers are the most dangerous carriers of the virus. By demonstrating the defeat of the \u201cAfrican version\u201d [of AIDS\u2019 origins], we can whip up anti-American sentiments throughout the states of the continent.<ref name=\":3\" /></blockquote>\n\n=== Dissemination methods ===\nThe AIDS story exploded across the world, and was repeated by Soviet newspapers, magazines, wire services, radio broadcasts, and television. It appeared 40 times in Soviet media in 1987 alone. It received coverage in over 80 countries in more than 30 languages,<ref name=statereport/> primarily in leftist and communist media publications, and was found in countries as widespread as [[Bolivia]], [[Grenada]], Pakistan, New Zealand, [[Nigeria]], and [[Malta]]. A few versions made their way into non-communist press in [[Indonesia]] and [[Philippines|the Philippines]].<ref name=statereport/>\n\nDissemination was usually along a recognized pattern: propaganda and disinformation would first appear in a country outside of the USSR and only then be picked up by a Soviet news agency, [[Circular reporting|which attributed it to others' investigative journalism]]. That the story came from a foreign source (not widely known to be Soviet controlled or influenced) added credibility to the allegations, especially in impoverished and less educated countries which generally could not afford access to Western news satellite feeds. To aid in media placement, Soviet propaganda was provided free of charge, and many stories came with cash benefits.<ref name=statereport/> This was particularly the case in India and [[Ghana]], where the Soviet Union maintained a large propaganda and disinformation apparatus for covert media placement.<ref name=statereport/>\n\n==== Soviet narrative ====\nTo explain how AIDS outbreaks in Africa occurred simultaneously, the [[Voice of Russia|Moscow World Service]] announced a discovery by Soviet correspondent Aleksandr Zhukov, who claimed that in the early 1970s, a Pentagon-controlled West German lab in [[Zaire]] \"succeeded in modifying the non-lethal [[Simian immunodeficiency virus|Green Monkey virus]] into the deadly AIDS virus.\" [[Radio Moscow]] also claimed that instead of testing a cholera vaccine, American scientists were actually infecting unwitting Zairians, thus spreading AIDS throughout the continent. These scientists were unaware of the long period before symptom onset, and resumed experimentation on convicts upon return to the U.S., where it then spread when the prisoners escaped.<ref name=statereport/>\n\nClaims that the [[CIA]] had sent \"AIDS-oiled condoms\" to other countries sprang up independently in the African press, well after the disinformation operation started.<ref name=\"infektion\"/> In 1987, a book (''Once Again About the CIA'') was published by the Novosti Press Agency, with the quote:\n\n{{Quote|text=The CIA Directorate of Science and Technology is continuously modernizing its inventory of pathogenic preparations, bacteria and viruses and studying their effect on man in various parts of the world. To this end, the CIA uses American medical centers in foreign countries. A case in point was the Pakistani Medical Research Center in [[Lahore]]\u2026 set up in 1962 allegedly for combating malaria.}}\n\nThe resulting public backlash eventually closed down the legitimate medical research center. Soviet allegations declared the purpose of these research projects, to include that of AIDS, was to \"enlarge the war arsenal.\"<ref name=statereport/>\n\n==Worldwide response to AIDS allegations==\n[[File:Deception, Disinformation, and Strategic Communications.pdf|thumb|''Deception, Disinformation, and Strategic Communications'',<ref>Fletcher Schoen and Christopher J.

The president of the [[Soviet Academy of Medical Sciences]] clearly stated that he believed the virus to be of natural origin. Other scientists and doctors from Paris, East and West Berlin, India, and Belgium called the AIDS rumors lies, scientifically unfounded, and otherwise impossible to seriously consider.<ref name=statereport/> Although Segal himself never said \"this is fact\" and was very careful to maintain this line throughout his report, \"such technical qualifiers do not diminish the impact of the charges, however, because when they are replayed, such qualifiers are typically either omitted or overlooked by readers or listeners.\"<ref name=statereport/>\n\nU.S. Embassy officials wrote dozens of letters to various newspaper editors and journalists, and held meetings and press conferences to clarify matters.

The study had been distributed at the summit meeting of the Non-Aligned Movement in August\u2013September 1986 in a brochure entitled, \u201cAIDS: USA home-made evil, NOT out of AFRICA.\u201d<ref name=\":0\" /> The report was quoted heavily by Soviet propagandists, and the Segals were often said to be French researchers to hide their connections to communism. Although both Segals, given the double danger to them as Jews and members of the German Communist Party, had fled into exile in France in 1933, both had attained Soviet citizenship in 1940 on the basis of Jakob's birth in (then Soviet-annexed) Lithuania, and in 1953, they had returned to Germany\u2014specifically, to communist East Berlin.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.deutsche-biographie.de/gnd126674272.html|title=Segal, Jakob - Deutsche Biographie|last=Biographie|first=Deutsche|website=www.deutsche-biographie.de|language=de|access-date=2019-07-23}}</ref>\n\nIn his report, Jakob Segal postulated that the AIDS virus was synthesized by combining parts of two distantly related retroviruses: [[Visna virus|VISNA]] and [[HTLV-1]].<ref name=\"statereport\" /> An excerpt of the Segal report reads as follows:\n\n{{Quote|text=It is very easy using genetic technologies to unite two parts of completely independent viruses\u2026 but who would be interested in doing this? The military, of course\u2026 In 1977 a special top security lab\u2026 was set up\u2026at the Pentagon's central biological laboratory. One year after that\u2026 the first cases of AIDS occurred in the US, in New York City. How it occurred precisely at this moment and how the virus managed to get out of the secret, hush-hush laboratory is quite easy to understand. Everyone knows that prisoners are used for military experiments in the U.S. They are promised their freedom if they come out of the experiment alive.<ref name=statereport/>}}\n\nElsewhere in the report, Segal said that his hypothesis was based purely on assumptions, extrapolations, and hearsay and not at all on direct scientific evidence.<ref name=statereport/>\n\nThe exact relationship of both Segals to the KGB, Stasi, or both at this time\u2014to the extent that it existed\u2014remains unclear. Both publicly denied any involvement of the KGB or Stasi in their work.  The Deputy Director of HVA/X, Wolfgang Mutz, hinted that the HVA had played a role in the publication \u2013 or actually, the photocopying \u2013 and distribution of the Harare brochure in talks with Bulgarian State Security in September 1986.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.bstu.de/assets/bstu/de/Publikationen/BFi33_Selvage_AIDS.pdf|title=Die AIDS-Verschw\u00f6rung.

This office in HVA/SWT apparently registered both Segals in this dossier as \"contact persons\" under the codename \"Diagnosis\"; whenever other divisions of the Stasi inquired about the Segals, they were directed to this office. HVA/SWT\u2014or \"the security,\" as Jakob Segal called them\u2014gave him at least one piece of advice regarding his study before its printing and distribution. Whether Segal listened to this advice remains unclear. Still, given their official designation as \u201ccontact persons,\u201d they need not have known, at least officially, that they were dealing with the Stasi, although Jakob Segal likely knew or could have guessed, given his past dealings with both the Stasi and the KGB. It is quite possible that HVA/SWT was already coordinating with the KGB regarding Segal\u2019s research \u2013 even without his knowledge \u2013 in the second half of 1985, at the time that \u201cWind\u201d was registered.<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://www.bstu.de/assets/bstu/de/Publikationen/BFi33_Selvage_AIDS.pdf|title=Die AIDS-Verschw\u00f6rung.

His articles and brochures, the KGB wrote, had attained \"great renown.\" This was especially the case in African countries, where governments and researchers were rejecting as racist assertions by U.S. researchers that AIDS had originated naturally in Africa, where it had spread from monkeys to humans.<ref name=\":3\" /> The KGB wrote the Bulgarians:<blockquote>We are currently resolving the task of bringing the [active] measures down to a more practical level, and in particular, to attain specific political results by exploiting the \u201claboratory version\u201d for AM [active measures] on other issues. So, efforts are being made to intensify anti-base sentiments in countries where American forces are deployed by using slogans suggesting that U.S. soldiers are the most dangerous carriers of the virus. By demonstrating the defeat of the \u201cAfrican version\u201d [of AIDS\u2019 origins], we can whip up anti-American sentiments throughout the states of the continent.<ref name=\":3\" /></blockquote>\n\n=== Dissemination methods ===\nThe AIDS story exploded across the world, and was repeated by Soviet newspapers, magazines, wire services, radio broadcasts, and television. It appeared 40 times in Soviet media in 1987 alone. It received coverage in over 80 countries in more than 30 languages,<ref name=statereport/> primarily in leftist and communist media publications, and was found in countries as widespread as [[Bolivia]], [[Grenada]], Pakistan, New Zealand, [[Nigeria]], and [[Malta]]. A few versions made their way into non-communist press in [[Indonesia]] and [[Philippines|the Philippines]].<ref name=statereport/>\n\nDissemination was usually along a recognized pattern: propaganda and disinformation would first appear in a country outside of the USSR and only then be picked up by a Soviet news agency, [[Circular reporting|which attributed it to others' investigative journalism]]. That the story came from a foreign source (not widely known to be Soviet controlled or influenced) added credibility to the allegations, especially in impoverished and less educated countries which generally could not afford access to Western news satellite feeds. To aid in media placement, Soviet propaganda was provided free of charge, and many stories came with cash benefits.<ref name=statereport/> This was particularly the case in India and [[Ghana]], where the Soviet Union maintained a large propaganda and disinformation apparatus for covert media placement.<ref name=statereport/>\n\n==== Soviet narrative ====\nTo explain how AIDS outbreaks in Africa occurred simultaneously, the [[Voice of Russia|Moscow World Service]] announced a discovery by Soviet correspondent Aleksandr Zhukov, who claimed that in the early 1970s, a Pentagon-controlled West German lab in [[Zaire]] \"succeeded in modifying the non-lethal [[Simian immunodeficiency virus|Green Monkey virus]] into the deadly AIDS virus.\" [[Radio Moscow]] also claimed that instead of testing a cholera vaccine, American scientists were actually infecting unwitting Zairians, thus spreading AIDS throughout the continent. These scientists were unaware of the long period before symptom onset, and resumed experimentation on convicts upon return to the U.S., where it then spread when the prisoners escaped.<ref name=statereport/>\n\nClaims that the [[CIA]] had sent \"AIDS-oiled condoms\" to other countries sprang up independently in the African press, well after the disinformation operation started.<ref name=\"infektion\"/> In 1987, a book (''Once Again About the CIA'') was published by the Novosti Press Agency, with the quote:\n\n{{Quote|text=The CIA Directorate of Science and Technology is continuously modernizing its inventory of pathogenic preparations, bacteria and viruses and studying their effect on man in various parts of the world. To this end, the CIA uses American medical centers in foreign countries. A case in point was the Pakistani Medical Research Center in [[Lahore]]\u2026 set up in 1962 allegedly for combating malaria.}}\n\nThe resulting public backlash eventually closed down the legitimate medical research center. Soviet allegations declared the purpose of these research projects, to include that of AIDS, was to \"enlarge the war arsenal.\"<ref name=statereport/>\n\n==Worldwide response to AIDS allegations==\n[[File:Deception, Disinformation, and Strategic Communications.pdf|thumb|''Deception, Disinformation, and Strategic Communications'',<ref>Fletcher Schoen and Christopher J.

The U.S. refused to help as long as the disinformation campaign continued.<ref name=statereport/> The Segal Report and the plenitude of press articles were dismissed by both Western and Soviet virologists as nonsense.<ref name=statereport/>\n\nDr. Meinrad Koch, a West Berlin AIDS expert, stated in 1987 that the Segal report was \"utter nonsense\" and called it an \"evil pseudo-scientific political concoction.\" Other scientists also pointed out flaws and inaccuracies in the Segal Report, including Dr. [[Viktor Zhdanov]] of the Ivanovsky Institute of Virology in Moscow, who was the top Soviet AIDS expert at the time. The president of the [[Soviet Academy of Medical Sciences]] clearly stated that he believed the virus to be of natural origin. Other scientists and doctors from Paris, East and West Berlin, India, and Belgium called the AIDS rumors lies, scientifically unfounded, and otherwise impossible to seriously consider.<ref name=statereport/> Although Segal himself never said \"this is fact\" and was very careful to maintain this line throughout his report, \"such technical qualifiers do not diminish the impact of the charges, however, because when they are replayed, such qualifiers are typically either omitted or overlooked by readers or listeners.\"<ref name=statereport/>\n\nU.S. Embassy officials wrote dozens of letters to various newspaper editors and journalists, and held meetings and press conferences to clarify matters. Many of their efforts resulted in newspapers printing retractions and apologies.<ref name=statereport/> Rebuttals appeared in reports to Congress and from the State Department saying that it was impossible at the time to build a virus as complex as AIDS; medical research had only gotten so far as to clone simple viruses. Antibodies were found decades earlier than the reported research started, and the main academic source used for the story (Segal's Report) contained inaccuracies about even such basic things as American geography\u2014Segal said that outbreaks appeared in [[New York City]] because it was the closest big city to Fort Detrick. [[Philadelphia]], [[Baltimore]], and [[Washington, D.C.]] are all closer, while New York is {{convert|250|mi|km}} away.<ref name=statereport/>\n\nThe [[Mikhail Gorbachev|Gorbachev]] administration also responded indignantly and launched a defensive denial campaign \"aimed at limiting the damage done to its credibility by U.S. efforts to raise world consciousness concerning the scope of Soviet disinformation activities.\"<ref name=statereport/> The Soviet Union interfered with general attempts by U.S. Embassy officials to address misconceptions and expose the Soviet disinformation campaign, to include placing pressure on news agencies that recanted their position. For example, ''[[Literaturnaya Gazeta]]'' on December 3, 1986, castigated a Brazilian newspaper which earlier in the year had run a retraction following its publication of the AIDS disinformation story. In 1987, Moscow's [[RIA Novosti|Novosti]] news agency disseminated a report datelined [[Brazzaville]] (Congo), calling on the West to put an end to the \"anti-African campaign,\" and repeating the charges that the virus was created in US military laboratories\" while in 1986 ''Literaturnaya Gazeta'' warned specifically against contact with Americans.<ref name=statereport/>\n\nIn 1988, ''Sovetskaya Rossiya'' put out an article defending their right to report different views. The chief of Novosti stated that it drew upon foreign sources for much of the AIDS coverage, and that the press was free under [[glasnost]].<ref name=statereport/>\n\nThe [[Mitrokhin Archive]] reveals that\n\n{{quote|text=faced with American protests and the denunciation of the story by the international scientific community, however, Gorbachev and his advisors were clearly concerned that exposure of Soviet disinformation might damage the new Soviet image in the West. In 1987, US officials were told in Moscow that the AIDS story was officially disowned, Soviet press coverage of the story came to an almost complete halt.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Andrew|first1=Christopher|first2=Vasili|last2=Mitrokhin |url=https://archive.org/details/TheWorldWasGoingOurWayTheKGBAndTheBattleForTheTheThirdWorld|title=The World Was Going Our Way: The KGB and the Battle for the Third World: Newly Revealed Secrets from the Mitrokhin Archive|date=10 October 2006|publisher=Basic Books|via=archive.org|isbn=978-0465003136}}</ref>}}\n\nThe campaign faded from most Soviet media outlets, but it occasionally resurfaced abroad in third-world countries as late as 1988, usually via press placement agents.<ref name=statereport/>\n\n==Aftermath==\n\nIn 1992, 15% of Americans considered it definitely or probably true that \"the AIDS virus was created deliberately in a government laboratory.\"<ref name=\"infektion\">{{cite journal|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/csi-studies/studies/vol53no4/pdf/U-%20Boghardt-AIDS-Made%20in%20the%20USA-17Dec.pdf|title=Soviet Bloc Intelligence and Its AIDS Disinformation Campaign (Operation INFEKTION)|journal=[[Studies in Intelligence]]|first=Thomas|last=Boghardt|date=December 2009|volume=53|issue=4<!-- https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/csi-publications/csi-studies/studies/vol53no4/soviet-bloc-intelligence-and-its-aids.html -->}}</ref> In 2005, a study by the [[RAND Corporation]] and [[Oregon State University]] revealed that nearly 50% of African Americans thought AIDS was man-made, over 25% believed AIDS was a product of a government laboratory, 12% believed it was created and spread by the CIA, and 15% believed that AIDS was a form of genocide against black people.<ref name=\"infektion\"/> Other [[Discredited AIDS origins theories|AIDS conspiracy theories]] have abounded, and have been discredited by the mainstream scientific community.\n\nIn 1992, KGB Director [[Yevgeny Primakov]] admitted that the KGB was behind the newspaper articles claiming that AIDS was created by the U.S. government.<ref name=kello/> Segal's role was exposed by KGB defector [[Vasili Mitrokhin]] in the [[Mitrokhin Archive]].

The show stars [[Tim Allen]] as an executive at a sporting goods store chain headquartered in Denver, Colorado, who is a married father of three daughters and a grandfather to his eldest daughter's son.
