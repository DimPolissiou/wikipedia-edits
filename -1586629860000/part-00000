Division]]), whilst Alliance Dudelange was struggling to remain in the second league (the [[Luxembourg Division of Honour|Division of Honour]]). The new club would take Alliance's place in the Division of Honour in the 1991\u201392 season.\n\nF91 was promoted in its first season, and soon established itself as a competent top-flight team, not finishing outside the top half of the table until 1996\u201397. Towards the end of the 1990s, Dudelange gradually improved, and brought to an end [[Jeunesse Esch]]'s era of dominance by storming to the 1999\u201300 league title by eleven points.\n\nIn [[Luxembourg National Division 2004-05|2004\u201305]], Dudelange won the title and competed in the [[UEFA Champions League]] for the 2005\u201306 season. In the competition Dudelange became the first club in Luxembourg's history to reach the second qualifying round, after a remarkable victory over [[H\u0160K Zrinjski Mostar|NK Zrinjski]] (they lost 0\u20131 at home in the first leg, in the second leg they scored a goal in the 3rd minute of [[Association football#Duration and tie-breaking methods|stoppage time]] to equalize on aggregate, and then scored 3 more goals in extra time). However, Dudelange were easily beaten by [[SK Rapid Wien|Rapid Wien]] in the second qualifying round.\n\nIn the [[Luxembourg National Division 2005-06|2005\u201306 season]], Dudelange completed the [[Luxembourg National Division|league]] and [[Luxembourg Cup|cup]] [[The Double (Luxembourg)|Double]] for the first time since the merger. They replicated this feat in the [[Luxembourg National Division 2006-07|2006\u201307 season]], and won a fourth consecutive National Division title in [[Luxembourg National Division 2007-08|2007\u201308]]. \n\nIn the [[2012\u201313 UEFA Champions League]], F91 Dudelange defeated [[S.P. Tre Penne|Tre Penne]] 11\u20130 on aggregate, earning them an appointment with Austrian champion [[FC Red Bull Salzburg|Red Bull Salzburg]] in the second round. They defeated Salzburg 1\u20130 in Luxemburg, and lost 3\u20134 in Salzburg, to win the tie on the away goal rule.  For the first time in club history, Dudelange qualified for the third round of the competition, in which they were beaten 5-1 on aggregate by [[NK_Maribor|Maribor]].\n\nIn [[2013\u201314 Luxembourg National Division|2013\u201314]], Dudelange reclaimed the title with a 3\u20130 victory over [[CS Fola Esch|Fola Esch]] on the final day of the season. This earned the club a spot in the [[2014\u201315 UEFA Champions League]].\n\nIn 2018, F91 Dudelange became the first Luxembourgish team to reach the group stage of a major European competition, after defeating [[CFR Cluj]] 5\u20132 on aggregate in the [[2018\u201319 UEFA Europa League qualifying phase and play-off round#Play-off round|UEFA Europa League play-off round]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.uefa.com/uefaeuropaleague/season=2019/matches/round=2000989/match=2025442/index.html|title=UEFA Europa League - CFR Cluj-Dudelange|last=UEFA.com|website=UEFA.com|language=en|access-date=2018-08-30}}</ref> Due to Dudelange's apparent [[underdog]] status, daily newspaper ''[[Gazeta Sporturilor]]'' regarded CFR's elimination as \"the biggest shame in the history of Romanian football\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gsp.ro/international/europa-league/cfr-cluj-dudelange-2-3-5-motive-pentru-care-dubla-cfr-dudelange-este-cea-mai-mare-rusine-din-istoria-fotbalului-romanesc-547348.html|title=CFR CLUJ - DUDELANGE 2-3 // 5 motive pentru care \"dubla\" CFR - Dudelange este cea mai mare ru\u0219ine din istoria fotbalului rom\u00e2nesc|trans-title=CFR CLUJ - DUDELANGE 2-3 // 5 reasons why the CFR - Dudelange \"double\" is the biggest shame in the history of Romanian football|newspaper=[[Gazeta Sporturilor]]|language=Romanian|date=31 August 2018|accessdate=19 September 2018}}</ref> Dudelange had also previously defeated Polish side [[Legia Warsaw]] in the third qualifying round.\n\nIn 2019, Dudelange qualified for the [[UEFA Europa League|Europa League]] [[2019\u201320 UEFA Europa League|group stages]] for the second successive season after defeating [[FC Ararat-Armenia]] in the play-off round in a penalty shootout. \n\nDudelange became the first ever team from Luxembourg to win a game in a European group stage after beating [[APOEL]] 4\u20133 in [[Nicosia]] on 19 September 2019.

1991 as a merger between three teams in the city \u2014  [[Alliance Dudelange]], [[Stade Dudelange]] and [[US Dudelange]]. Domestically, it has since won the National Division on 15 occasions and the [[Luxembourg Cup]] eight times. \n\nF91 Dudelange qualified for the [[2018\u201319 UEFA Europa League]], becoming the first club from the country to reach the group stage of a [[UEFA|European competition]]. Dudelange also made the [[2019\u201320 UEFA Europa League]] group stage where they became the first team from Luxembourg to win a game in the group stage after a shock 4\u20133 victory over [[APOEL]] of [[Cyprus]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lequotidien.lu/football/victoire-3-4-a-nicosie-le-f91-gagne-le-match-le-plus-fou-de-lhistoire-du-foot-luxembourgeois/|title=Victoire 3-4 \u00e0 Nicosie : Le F91 gagne le match le plus fou de l\u2019histoire du foot luxembourgeois|first=Julien|last=Mollereau|publisher=Le Quotidien|date=19 September 2019|language=fr}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n[[File:Entstehung F91 Dudelange.png|thumb|right|260px|Simplified illustration of origin of F91 Dudelange]]\nIt was formed in 1991 from the clubs [[Alliance Dudelange]], [[Stade Dudelange]], and [[US Dudelange]]. All three clubs had won the [[Luxembourg National Division|National Division]] or the [[Luxembourg Cup]] before, but each had fallen upon hard times, and the amalgamated club was expected to be more stable, in both a sporting and financial sense.\n\nTurning the club into a title-challenging team took a while. Stade Dudelange and US Dudelange had been in Luxembourg's third tier (the [[Luxembourg 1. Division|1. Division]]), whilst Alliance Dudelange was struggling to remain in the second league (the [[Luxembourg Division of Honour|Division of Honour]]). The new club would take Alliance's place in the Division of Honour in the 1991\u201392 season.\n\nF91 was promoted in its first season, and soon established itself as a competent top-flight team, not finishing outside the top half of the table until 1996\u201397. Towards the end of the 1990s, Dudelange gradually improved, and brought to an end [[Jeunesse Esch]]'s era of dominance by storming to the 1999\u201300 league title by eleven points.\n\nIn [[Luxembourg National Division 2004-05|2004\u201305]], Dudelange won the title and competed in the [[UEFA Champions League]] for the 2005\u201306 season. In the competition Dudelange became the first club in Luxembourg's history to reach the second qualifying round, after a remarkable victory over [[H\u0160K Zrinjski Mostar|NK Zrinjski]] (they lost 0\u20131 at home in the first leg, in the second leg they scored a goal in the 3rd minute of [[Association football#Duration and tie-breaking methods|stoppage time]] to equalize on aggregate, and then scored 3 more goals in extra time). However, Dudelange were easily beaten by [[SK Rapid Wien|Rapid Wien]] in the second qualifying round.\n\nIn the [[Luxembourg National Division 2005-06|2005\u201306 season]], Dudelange completed the [[Luxembourg National Division|league]] and [[Luxembourg Cup|cup]] [[The Double (Luxembourg)|Double]] for the first time since the merger. They replicated this feat in the [[Luxembourg National Division 2006-07|2006\u201307 season]], and won a fourth consecutive National Division title in [[Luxembourg National Division 2007-08|2007\u201308]]. \n\nIn the [[2012\u201313 UEFA Champions League]], F91 Dudelange defeated [[S.P. Tre Penne|Tre Penne]] 11\u20130 on aggregate, earning them an appointment with Austrian champion [[FC Red Bull Salzburg|Red Bull Salzburg]] in the second round. They defeated Salzburg 1\u20130 in Luxemburg, and lost 3\u20134 in Salzburg, to win the tie on the away goal rule.  For the first time in club history, Dudelange qualified for the third round of the competition, in which they were beaten 5-1 on aggregate by [[NK_Maribor|Maribor]].\n\nIn [[2013\u201314 Luxembourg National Division|2013\u201314]], Dudelange reclaimed the title with a 3\u20130 victory over [[CS Fola Esch|Fola Esch]] on the final day of the season. This earned the club a spot in the [[2014\u201315 UEFA Champions League]].\n\nIn 2018, F91 Dudelange became the first Luxembourgish team to reach the group stage of a major European competition, after defeating [[CFR Cluj]] 5\u20132 on aggregate in the [[2018\u201319 UEFA Europa League qualifying phase and play-off round#Play-off round|UEFA Europa League play-off round]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.uefa.com/uefaeuropaleague/season=2019/matches/round=2000989/match=2025442/index.html|title=UEFA Europa League - CFR Cluj-Dudelange|last=UEFA.com|website=UEFA.com|language=en|access-date=2018-08-30}}</ref> Due to Dudelange's apparent [[underdog]] status, daily newspaper ''[[Gazeta Sporturilor]]'' regarded CFR's elimination as \"the biggest shame in the history of Romanian football\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gsp.ro/international/europa-league/cfr-cluj-dudelange-2-3-5-motive-pentru-care-dubla-cfr-dudelange-este-cea-mai-mare-rusine-din-istoria-fotbalului-romanesc-547348.html|title=CFR CLUJ - DUDELANGE 2-3 // 5 motive pentru care \"dubla\" CFR - Dudelange este cea mai mare ru\u0219ine din istoria fotbalului rom\u00e2nesc|trans-title=CFR CLUJ - DUDELANGE 2-3 // 5 reasons why the CFR - Dudelange \"double\" is the biggest shame in the history of Romanian football|newspaper=[[Gazeta Sporturilor]]|language=Romanian|date=31 August 2018|accessdate=19 September 2018}}</ref> Dudelange had also previously defeated Polish side [[Legia Warsaw]] in the third qualifying round.\n\nIn 2019, Dudelange qualified for the [[UEFA Europa League|Europa League]] [[2019\u201320 UEFA Europa League|group stages]] for the second successive season after defeating [[FC Ararat-Armenia]] in the play-off round in a penalty shootout. \n\nDudelange became the first ever team from Luxembourg to win a game in a European group stage after beating [[APOEL]] 4\u20133 in [[Nicosia]] on 19 September 2019.

It lies in the Roman Catholic parish of [[Templeport]] and barony of [[Tullyhaw]].\n\n==Geography==\n\nCorboy Glebe is bounded on the north by [[Kildoagh]] townland, on the west by [[Cloncurkney]] townland,  on the south by [[Gortaclogher]] townland and on the east by [[Port, Templeport]] townland. Its chief geographical features are Bellaboy Lough (Irish = Loch B\u00e9al \u00c1tha Bu\u00ed = The Lake of the Entrance to the Yellow Ford), Templeport Lough, a wood, streams and a sandpit. There are also three exceptional specimen trees in the townland- a Sycamore ([[Acer pseudoplatanus]]) [http://treecouncil.ie/treeregisterofireland/125.htm]; a [[Beech]] (Fagus Sylvatica) [http://treecouncil.ie/treeregisterofireland/126.htm] and a Lime ([[Tilia \u00d7 europaea]]) [http://treecouncil.ie/treeregisterofireland/127.htm]. Corboy Glebe is traversed by minor public roads and rural lanes. The townland covers 145 statute acres.<ref name=\"IreAtlas\"/>\n\n==History==\n\nThe 1609 Baronial Map depicts the townland as ''Corboy''.<ref>[http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documents/mpf1-58.pdf National Archives Dublin]</ref><ref>[http://www.templeport.ie/pages/1609-TP-Baronial-Map.html]</ref>\n\nThe 1652 Commonwealth Survey spells the name as ''Corboy''.\n\nThe 1665 Down Survey map depicts it as ''Cockboy''.<ref>Trinity College Dublin: [http://downsurvey.tcd.ie/down-survey-maps.php#bm=Tullaghhagh&c=Cavan&indexOfObjectValue=-1&indexOfObjectValueSubstring=-1 The Down Survey of Ireland.]</ref>\n\n[[William Petty]]'s 1685 map depicts it as ''Corkboy''.<ref>[http://downsurvey.tcd.ie/down-survey-maps.php#c=Cavan]</ref>\n\nCorboy Glebe formed part of the termon or hospital lands belonging to Templeport Church and so its history belongs to the ecclesiastical history of the parish.

{"title_page": "4-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase inhibitor", "text_new": "'''4-Hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase''' ('''HPPD''') '''inhibitors''' ('''HPPD inhbitors''') are a class of [[herbicides]] that prevent plants by blocking [[4-Hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase]], an [[enzyme]] in plants that breaks down the [[amino acid]] [[tyrosine]] into molecules that are then used by plants to create other molecules that plants need.  This process of breakdown, or [[catabolism]], and making new molecules from the results, or [[biosynthesis]], is something all living things do.  HPPD inhibitors were first brought to market in 1980, although their mechanism of action was not understood until the late 1990s.  They were originally used primarily in Japan in rice production, but since the late 1990s have been used in Europe and North America for corn,  soybeans, and cereals, and since the 2000s have become more important as weeds have become resistant to [[glyphosate]] and other herbicides.  [[Genetically modified crops]] are under development that include resistance to HPPD inhibitors.   There is a [[pharmaceutical drug]] on the market, [[nitisinone]], that was originally under development as an herbicide as a member of this class, and is used to treat an [[orphan disease]], [[type I tyrosinemia]].\n\nHPPD inhibitors can be classified into three fundamental [[toxophore|chemical frameworks]]: pyrazolones, triketones, and diketonitriles.  The triketone class is based on a chemical that certain plants make in self-defense called [[leptospermone]]; the class was developed by scientists at companies that eventually became part of [[Syngenta]].  [[Bayer CropScience]] has also been active in developing new HPPD inhibitors.\n\n==Mechanism of action==\nThe mechanism of action for HPPD inhibitors was misunderstood for the first twenty years that these products were sold, starting in 1980.<ref name=Almsick>{{cite journal | last1 = van Almsick | first1 = Andreas | year = | title = New HPPD-Inhibitors - A Proven Mode of Action as a New Hope to Solve Current Weed Problems | url = http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/resinf/opm/2009/00000020/00000001/art00009 | journal = Outlooks on Pest Management | volume = 20 | issue = 1| pages = 27\u201330 }}</ref>   They were originally thought to be inhibitors of [[protoporphyrinogen oxidase]] (protox).<ref name=Cole>{{cite journal | last1 = Cole | first1 = D. | last2 = Pallett | first2 = K.E. | last3 = Rodgers | first3 = M. | year = 2000 | title = Discovering new Modes of Action for herbicides and the impact of genomics | url = | journal = Pesticide Outlook | volume = 12 | issue = 6| pages = 223\u20139 | doi = 10.1039/B009272J }}</ref>\n\n[[4-Hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase]] (HPPD) is an [[enzyme]] found in both plants and animals which catalyzes the [[catabolism]] of the [[amino acid]] [[tyrosine]].<ref name=Moran>{{cite journal|last1=Moran |first1=GR |date=Jan 2005 |title=4-Hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/8209349 |format=PDF |journal=Arch Biochem Biophys |volume=433 |issue=1 |pages=117\u201328 |doi=10.1016/j.abb.2004.08.015 |pmid=15581571 }}</ref> Preventing the breakdown of tyrosine has three negative consequences:  the excess of tyrosine stunts growth; the plant suffers [[oxidative damage]] due to lack of [[tocopherols]] (vitamin E); and \n[[chlorophyll]] is destroyed due to lack of [[carotenoids]] that protect it.<ref name=Almsick/> Plants turn white without deformation due to a complete loss of chlorophyll, which has led compounds of this class  to be classified as \"bleaching herbicides\", as are protox inhibitors.<ref name=Almsick/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www2.lsuagcenter.com/subjects/weedscience/pdf/AGRO4070/Handout16.pdf|title=Inhibition of Pigment Synthesis (Bleaching Herbicides)|author=|date=|website=LSUAgCenter.com|access-date=8 September 2017}}</ref><ref>Wolfgang Kramer and Ulrich Schirmer, Modern Crop Protection Compounds (1)197-276(2012)</ref>\n\nMore specifically, inhibition of HPPD prevents the formation of a breakdown product, [[homogentisic acid]], which in turn is a key precursor for the [[biosynthesis]] of both tocopherols and [[plastoquinone]].

In 1990 sulcotrione was introduced for post- emergence weed control in corn.  Isoxaflutole opened the market more broadly for HPPD inhibitors when it was introduced in 1996 for corn and sugarcane, and for use as a pre-emergence herbicide that could control [[broadleaf weeds]] as did sulcotrione, but also additional grass weeds.  Benzobicyclon, was introduced in 2001 for control of broadleaf weeds and some [[sedges]] that are problems in rice, that had become resistant to sulfonylurea herbicides.   Mesotrione was introduced in 2002 and like sulcotrione  is a triketone, so it is effective on the same weeds and crops, but is more potent, making it more useful in mixes with other herbicides - an important factor for fully controlling weeds and preventing the development of resistance.   It has become the biggest selling member of the HPPD class.<ref name=Almsick/>\n\nTopramezone was introduced in 2006 for corn and soy, and is the most potent HPPD inhibitor, but has serious carry-over issues especially for soybean in US, where the minimum time from application to planting is 18 months.  Tembotrione was introduced in 2007 for corn,  and works against key grass species and importantly, kills broadleaf weeds, including glyphosate-, ALS- and dicamba-resistant weeds.

The resulting extracts were applied to soil flats containing watergrass (''[[Echinochloa crus-galli]]'') as an indicator species at the very high application rate of 100&nbsp;lb./acre. There was a herbicidal effect from this test, so the extracts were developed on a preparative [[thin layer chromatography|thin layer chromatographic]] sheet. The same ''Echinochloa crus-galli'' seeds were placed on this sheet and germinated. The active ingredient was identified by bleaching symptoms on the test species.\n\nThe area where the herbicidal activity was seen was extracted and he submitted the isolated active ingredient to Ken Cheng at the Western Research Center who, using [[proton NMR]], [[infrared spectroscopy|IR]] and [[mass spectrometry]] identified the structure as being that of [[Leptospermone]] ('''IV''')  which was a known natural product <ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Hellyer | first1 = R.O. | year = 1968| title = The occurrence of \u03b2-triketones in the steam-volatile oils of myrtaceous Australian plants | url = | journal = Aust.

These tests showed that it had modest [[herbicide|herbicidal]] activity against grass weeds at a very high application rate of 100&nbsp;lbs./acre. He prepared a series of analogs in which the alkanoyl group was modified and a patent was obtained on this series of compounds.<ref>Reed A. Gray, Chien K. Tseng, Ronald J. Rusay, 1-Hydroxy-2-(alkylketo)-4,4,6,6-tetramethyl cyclohexen-3,5-diones, US4,202,840(1980)</ref> These compounds had similar, weak herbicidal activity similar to that found with the lead compound. Because of the weak herbicidal activity, work on other analogs was not pursued.\n\nShortly after this, another WRC chemist, Bill Michaely, synthesized an aroyl triketone ('''V''') as an unexpected byproduct when attempting to synthesize a [[sethoxydim]] ('''VI''')<ref>MeisterPro Crop Protection Handbook 2011, p. 618</ref> analog. \n{|\n|[[File:HPPD aroyltriketone.png|left|thumb|'''V''']]\n|[[File:Sethoxydim chemical structure.png|right|thumb| '''VI''']]\n|}\n\nWhile this compound did not have any herbicidal activity, it did show activity in a screen designed to show [[Herbicide safener|antidotal]] activity toward other herbicides.  When attempting to optimize the antidote activity, several aryl substituted analogs were prepared. What was discovered was that those compounds with an ''[[arene substitution pattern|ortho]]'' substituent had herbicidal activity but no antidote activity. This observation coupled with the knowledge of the herbicidal activity of the earlier leptospermone analogs was pivotal in formulating an idea of a potential [[toxophore]] for this class of herbicides.\n\nA small task force consisting of David Lee, Bill Michaely and Don James prepared a number of substituted triketones with chloro-, bromo- and methyl-substituents in the ''ortho'' position. Biological activity remained modest and the task force was disbanded after a short while.\n\nOne working hypothesis was that the active ingredient in these triketones was the cyclized tetrahydroxanthenones('''VII'''). Bill Michaely prepared several of these, but the herbicidal activity remained modest and all work in the area was terminated.  It was not until David Lee was able to show that these compounds were in equilibrium with the 2-hydroxy triketones('''VIII''') by trapping the intermediate with [[methyl iodide]] that the reason for the biological activity was understood.\n{|\n|[[File:Tetrahydroxanthenone chemical structure.png|left|thumb| '''VII''']]\n|[[File:HPPD 2-hydroxytriketone.png|right|thumb| '''VIII''']]\n|}\n\nDavid Lee had a strong background in [[quantitative structure\u2013activity relationship]]s (QSAR) after a post-doctoral year with Professors Manfred Wolff and Peter Kollman where he used the [[Prophet system]].<ref>Lee, D.L., Kollman, P.A., Marsh, F.J., Wolff, M.E., Quantitative relationships between steroid structure and binding to putative progesterone receptors, J. Med. Chem. , 20 (1977) pp. 1139-46</ref> Looking over the QSAR ([[quantitative structure\u2013activity relationship]]s) of the triketones, David Lee saw a potential discrepancy in the existing structure-activity analysis. Other than the 2-chloro-4-nitro substitution pattern, no other triketones with electron-withdrawing substituents in the 4-position  had ever been prepared. He hypothesized that the activity of the triketones could be correlated to the electron withdrawing ability of the substituents. The activity of the 2-chloro-4-nitro analog was an outlier, and it was theorized that perhaps the nitro group was being reduced ''in vivo''. The 4-methylsulfonyl group was then prepared to test this hypothesis, and what was to become the commercial herbicide [[Mikado (herbicide)|Mikado]] ('''II''') was prepared. The prospect of improving the biological activity with new aromatic substitution patterns totally rejuvenated work on the triketones.\n\nA key discovery in the preparation of these compounds was the finding by Jim Heather in the WRC Process Development group that [[acetone cyanohydrin]] was a good catalyst for the preparation of the o-chloro analogs.<ref>James B. Heather, Pamela D. Milano, Process for the production of acylated 1,3- dicarbonyl compounds, US 4,695,673 (1987)</ref> Use of this catalyst allowed for the first time production of the o-nitro triketones.\n\nAt this point a very large effort on the synthesis of analogs was commenced with David Lee coordinating the effort. Key chemists participating in this were Charles Carter, Bill Michaely, Hsiao-ling Chin, Nhan Nguyen and Chris Knudsen, although at one time almost every synthesis chemist at the WRC worked on this project.<ref>(8) David L.

ICI then split off the pharmaceutical and agrochemical businesses as Zeneca and then Syngenta was formed in 2000 by the merger of Novartis Agribusiness and Zeneca Agrochemicals.\n\nAs part of [[toxicology]] studies, Martin Ellis at the ICI Central Toxicology Laboratory identified triketone inhibition of [[Tyrosine|tyrosine catabolism]] in rat liver and also found that [[tyrosine hydroxylase]] was not inhibited by the triketones.<ref>Ellis, M.K., A.C.

This process of breakdown, or [[catabolism]], and making new molecules from the results, or [[biosynthesis]], is something all living things do.  HPPD inhibitors were first brought to market in 1980, although their mechanism of action was not understood until the late 1990s.  They were originally used primarily in Japan in rice production, but since the late 1990s have been used in Europe and North America for corn,  soybeans, and cereals, and since the 2000s have become more important as weeds have become resistant to [[glyphosate]] and other herbicides.  [[Genetically modified crops]] are under development that include resistance to HPPD inhibitors.   There is a [[pharmaceutical drug]] on the market, [[nitisinone]], that was originally under development as an herbicide as a member of this class, and is used to treat an [[orphan disease]], [[type I tyrosinemia]].\n\nHPPD inhibitors can be classified into three fundamental [[toxophore|chemical frameworks]]: pyrazolones, triketones, and diketonitriles.

In 1990 sulcotrione was introduced for post- emergence weed control in corn.  Isoxaflutole opened the market more broadly for HPPD inhibitors when it was introduced in 1996 for corn and sugarcane, and for use as a pre-emergence herbicide that could control [[broadleaf weeds]] as did sulcotrione, but also additional grass weeds.  Benzobicyclon, was introduced in 2001 for control of broadleaf weeds and some [[sedges]] that are problems in rice, that had become resistant to sulfonylurea herbicides.   Mesotrione was introduced in 2002 and like sulcotrione  is a triketone, so it is effective on the same weeds and crops, but is more potent, making it more useful in mixes with other herbicides - an important factor for fully controlling weeds and preventing the development of resistance.

Tembotrione was introduced in 2007 for corn,  and works against key grass species and importantly, kills broadleaf weeds, including glyphosate-, ALS- and dicamba-resistant weeds. Used with [[safeners]] there are no crop-rotation restrictions.

The resulting extracts were applied to soil flats containing watergrass (''[[Echinochloa crus-galli]]'') as an indicator species at the very high application rate of 100&nbsp;lb./acre. There was a herbicidal effect from this test, so the extracts were developed on a preparative [[thin layer chromatography|thin layer chromatographic]] sheet. The same ''Echinochloa crus-galli'' seeds were placed on this sheet and germinated. The active ingredient was identified by bleaching symptoms on the test species.\n\nThe area where the herbicidal activity was seen was extracted and he submitted the isolated active ingredient to Ken Cheng at the Western Research Center who, using [[proton NMR]], [[infrared spectroscopy|IR]] and [[mass spectrometry]] identified the structure as being that of [[Leptospermone]] ('''IV''')  which was a known natural product <ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Hellyer | first1 = R.O. | year = 1968| title = The occurrence of \u03b2-triketones in the steam-volatile oils of myrtaceous Australian plants | url = | journal = Aust.

These tests showed that it had modest [[herbicide|herbicidal]] activity against grass weeds at a very high application rate of 100&nbsp;lbs./acre. He prepared a series of analogs in which the alkanoyl group was modified and a patent was obtained on this series of compounds.<ref>Reed A. Gray, Chien K. Tseng, Ronald J. Rusay, 1-Hydroxy-2-(alkylketo)-4,4,6,6-tetramethyl cyclohexen-3,5-diones, US4,202,840(1980)</ref> These compounds had similar, weak herbicidal activity similar to that found with the lead compound. Because of the weak herbicidal activity, work on other analogs was not pursued.\n\nShortly after this, another WRC chemist, Bill Michaely, synthesized an aroyl triketone ('''V''') as an unexpected byproduct when attempting to synthesize a [[sethoxydim]] ('''VI''')<ref>MeisterPro Crop Protection Handbook 2011, p. 618</ref> analog. \n{|\n|[[File:HPPD aroyltriketone.png|left|thumb|'''V''']]\n|[[File:Sethoxydim chemical structure.png|right|thumb| '''VI''']]\n|}\n\nWhile this compound did not have any herbicidal activity, it did show activity in a screen designed to show [[Herbicide safener|antidotal]] activity toward other herbicides.  When attempting to optimize the antidote activity, several aryl substituted analogs were prepared. What was discovered was that those compounds with an ''[[arene substitution pattern|ortho]]'' substituent had herbicidal activity but no antidote activity. This observation coupled with the knowledge of the herbicidal activity of the earlier leptospermone analogs was pivotal in formulating an idea of a potential [[toxophore]] for this class of herbicides.\n\nA small task force consisting of David Lee, Bill Michaely and Don James prepared a number of substituted triketones with chloro-, bromo- and methyl-substituents in the ''ortho'' position. Biological activity remained modest and the task force was disbanded after a short while.\n\nOne working hypothesis was that the active ingredient in these triketones was the cyclized tetrahydroxanthenones('''VII'''). Bill Michaely prepared several of these, but the herbicidal activity remained modest and all work in the area was terminated.  It was not until David Lee was able to show that these compounds were in equilibrium with the 2-hydroxy triketones('''VIII''') by trapping the intermediate with [[methyl iodide]] that the reason for the biological activity was understood.\n{|\n|[[File:Tetrahydroxanthenone chemical structure.png|left|thumb| '''VII''']]\n|[[File:HPPD 2-hydroxytriketone.png|right|thumb| '''VIII''']]\n|}\n\nDavid Lee had a strong background in [[quantitative structure\u2013activity relationship]]s (QSAR) after a post-doctoral year with Professors Manfred Wolff and Peter Kollman where he used the [[Prophet system]].<ref>Lee, D.L., Kollman, P.A., Marsh, F.J., Wolff, M.E., Quantitative relationships between steroid structure and binding to putative progesterone receptors, J. Med. Chem. , 20 (1977) pp. 1139-46</ref> Looking over the QSAR ([[quantitative structure\u2013activity relationship]]s) of the triketones, David Lee saw a potential discrepancy in the existing structure-activity analysis. Other than the 2-chloro-4-nitro substitution pattern, no other triketones with electron-withdrawing substituents in the 4-position  had ever been prepared. He hypothesized that the activity of the triketones could be correlated to the electron withdrawing ability of the substituents. The activity of the 2-chloro-4-nitro analog was an outlier, and it was theorized that perhaps the nitro group was being reduced ''in vivo''. The 4-methylsulfonyl group was then prepared to test this hypothesis, and what was to become the commercial herbicide [[Mikado (herbicide)|Mikado]] ('''II''') was prepared. The prospect of improving the biological activity with new aromatic substitution patterns totally rejuvenated work on the triketones.\n\nA key discovery in the preparation of these compounds was the finding by Jim Heather in the WRC Process Development group that [[acetone cyanohydrin]] was a good catalyst for the preparation of the o-chloro analogs.<ref>James B. Heather, Pamela D. Milano, Process for the production of acylated 1,3- dicarbonyl compounds, US 4,695,673 (1987)</ref> Use of this catalyst allowed for the first time production of the o-nitro triketones.\n\nAt this point a very large effort on the synthesis of analogs was commenced with David Lee coordinating the effort. Key chemists participating in this were Charles Carter, Bill Michaely, Hsiao-ling Chin, Nhan Nguyen and Chris Knudsen, although at one time almost every synthesis chemist at the WRC worked on this project.<ref>(8) David L.

ICI then split off the pharmaceutical and agrochemical businesses as Zeneca and then Syngenta was formed in 2000 by the merger of Novartis Agribusiness and Zeneca Agrochemicals.\n\nAs part of [[toxicology]] studies, Martin Ellis at the ICI Central Toxicology Laboratory identified triketone inhibition of [[Tyrosine|tyrosine catabolism]] in rat liver and also found that [[tyrosine hydroxylase]] was not inhibited by the triketones.<ref>Ellis, M.K., A.C.

A small number of PBM companies followed in the 1970s, with an explosion of hundreds of startup PBM companies in the 1980s at the peak of PBM gaming popularity, many of them small hobby companies\u2014more than 90 percent of which eventually folded. A number of independent PBM magazines also started in the 1980s, including ''[[Flagship magazine]]'', ''[[Gaming Universal]]'', and ''[[Paper Mayhem]]''. These magazines eventually went out of print, replaced in the 21st century by the online PBM journal ''[[Suspense and Decision]]''.\n\nPlay-by-mail games have a number of advantages and disadvantages related to other gaming genres. PBM games allow plenty of time\u2014sometimes days or weeks\u2014to consider moves or turns and players never run out of opponents to face. Additionally, the complexity of PBM games can be far beyond that allowed by a board game in an afternoon, and pits players against live opponents in these conditions, a challenge some players enjoy. Some games allow the number of opponents or teams in the dozens, even as high as fifty. PBM games also allow gamers to interact with others globally. And games with low turn rates compare well in costs with expensive board or video games. Some drawbacks include the price for some PBM games with high setup and/or turn costs, and the lack of ability for face-to-face roleplaying. Additionally, for some players, some games can be overly complex, and delays in turn processing can be a negative.\n\nPlay-by-mail games are multifaceted. In their earliest form they involved two players alternatively sending moves directly to each other by postal mail, such as in correspondence chess. Multi-player games, such as ''Diplomacy'' or more complex games available today, involve a [[game master]] who receives, processes, and adjudicates turn results for players. These games also introduce the element of [[diplomacy]] in which participants can discuss gameplay with each other, strategize, and form [[alliances]]. In the 1970s and 1980s, turn results were sometimes adjudicated completely by humans. Over time, partial or complete turn adjudication by computer became the norm. Games also involve open and closed end variants. Open ended games do not end and players can develop their positions to the fullest extent possible, whereas in closed end games, players typically pursue a set of victory conditions until game conclusion.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Postcard-for-correspondence-chess (trimmed image).png|thumb|right|Postcard for international correspondence chess]]\nThe earliest play-by-mail games developed as a way for geographically separated gamers to compete with each other using [[postal mail]]. [[Chess]] is the oldest example of this type. It has been played for hundreds of years in various countries by mail. In this two player game, players send moves directly to each other. Multi-player games emerged later. ''[[Diplomacy (game)|Diplomacy]]'' is an example of this type in which a central [[game master]] manages the game, receiving moves and publishing adjudications. ''Diplomacy'' was first played by mail in 1963.<ref name=babcock/> In the early 1970s, in the United States, [[Rick Loomis]], of [[Flying Buffalo Inc]], began a number of multi-player play-by-mail games;<ref>{{Cite journal |first= Rick|last= Loomis|authorlink= |coauthors= |year= 2013|month= |title= Letter from Rick Loomis to the Play By Mail/Email/Web/Turn Based Games Community |journal= Suspense and Decision|volume= December 2013|issue= 2|pages= 38|id= |url= http://playbymail.net/SuspenseAndDecision/Issue2.pdf |accessdate= March 20, 2020|quote= }}</ref> this included games such as ''[[Nuclear Destruction (play-by-mail)|Nuclear Destruction]]'', which launched in 1970.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.flyingbuffalo.com/nucdest.htm|title= Nuclear Destruction|author= |date= |work= Flying Buffalo, Inc|publisher= Flying Buffalo, Inc|accessdate= March 27, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThis began the professional PBM industry in the United States. Professional game moderation started in 1971 at Flying Buffalo which added games such as [[Battleplan (play-by-mail game)|''Battleplan'']], ''[[Heroic Fantasy]]'', ''[[Starweb]]'', and others, which by the late 1980s were all computer moderated.<ref name=Townsend>{{cite magazine |last= Townsend|first= Jim|date= 1988|title= The PBM Corner|url= |magazine= [[White Wolf Magazine]]|location= |publisher= | issue = 11|page= 20|access-date=}}</ref> For approximately five years, Flying Buffalo was the single dominant company in the US PBM industry until [[Schubel & Son]] entered the field in \"roughly\" 1976 with the human-moderated ''[[The Tribes of Crane|Tribes of Crane]]'' game.<ref name=Townsend/> Schubel & Son introduced fee structure innovations which allowed players to pay additional fees for additional options or special actions outside of the rules.

According to Jim Townsend: <blockquote>In the late 70's and all of the 80's, many small PBM firms have opened their doors and better than 90% of them have failed. Although PBM is an easy industry to get into, staying in business is another thing entirely. Literally hundreds of PBM companies have come and gone, most of them taking the money of would-be-customers with them.<ref name=Townsend/></blockquote>\n\nTownsend emphasized the risks for the PBM industry in that \"The new PBM company has such a small chance of surviving that no insurance company would write a policy to cover them.

The PBM genre's \"two preeminent magazines\" of the period were [[Flagship Magazine|''Flagship'']] and ''[[Paper Mayhem]]''.<ref>{{cite news |last= Paduch|first= Sally|date= June 27, 1993 |title= Email Brings Immediacy to Play-By-Mail Games|url= |work= New York Times|location= |page= RC21|access-date= |ref= Pad93}}</ref>\n\nThe 1990s brought the onset of the digital age of computers, with many gamers shifting to digital platforms versus play-by-mail games. But with the shift to the digital age has come new opportunities as well. PBM companies have introduced play-by-email (PBeM) options or games that are run in a turn-based fashion by email only.\n\nIn the early 1990s, the PBM industry still maintained some of the momentum from the 1980s.

An average PBM game has 10\u201320 players in it, but there are also games that have hundreds of players. Turn around time is the length of time it takes to get your turn back from a company. The average turnaround time is 2 weeks. Some games never end. They can go on virtually forever or until you decide to drop. Many games have victory conditions that can be achieved within a year or two. Prices vary for the different PBM games, but the average price per turn [in 1993] is about $5.00.<ref name=frontmatter/></blockquote>\n\n===Mechanics===\nAfter the initial setup of a PBM game, players begin submitting turn orders.

A small number of PBM companies followed in the 1970s, with an explosion of hundreds of startup PBM companies in the 1980s at the peak of PBM gaming popularity, many of them small hobby companies\u2014more than 90 percent of which eventually folded. A number of independent PBM magazines also started in the 1980s, including ''[[Flagship magazine]]'', ''[[Gaming Universal]]'', and ''[[Paper Mayhem]]''. These magazines eventually went out of print, replaced in the 21st century by the online PBM journal ''[[Suspense and Decision]]''.\n\nPlay-by-mail games have a number of advantages and disadvantages related to other gaming genres. PBM games allow plenty of time\u2014sometimes days or weeks\u2014to consider moves or turns and players never run out of opponents to face. Additionally, the complexity of PBM games can be far beyond that allowed by a board game in an afternoon, and pits players against live opponents in these conditions, a challenge some players enjoy. Some games allow the number of opponents or teams in the dozens, even as high as fifty. PBM games also allow gamers to interact with others globally. And games with low turn rates compare well in costs with expensive board or video games. Some drawbacks include the price for some PBM games with high setup and/or turn costs, and the lack of ability for face-to-face roleplaying. Additionally, for some players, some games can be overly complex, and delays in turn processing can be a negative.\n\nPlay-by-mail games are multifaceted. In their earliest form they involved two players alternatively sending moves directly to each other by postal mail, such as in correspondence chess. Multi-player games, such as ''Diplomacy'' or more complex games available today, involve a [[game master]] who receives, processes, and adjudicates turn results for players. These games also introduce the element of [[diplomacy]] in which participants can discuss gameplay with each other, strategize, and form [[alliances]]. In the 1970s and 1980s, turn results were sometimes adjudicated completely by humans. Over time, partial or complete turn adjudication by computer became the norm. Games also involve open and closed end variants. Open ended games do not end and players can develop their positions to the fullest extent possible, whereas in closed end games, players typically pursue a set of victory conditions until game conclusion.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Postcard-for-correspondence-chess (trimmed image).png|thumb|right|Postcard for international correspondence chess]]\nThe earliest play-by-mail games developed as a way for geographically separated gamers to compete with each other using [[postal mail]]. [[Chess]] is the oldest example of this type. It has been played for hundreds of years in various countries by mail. In this two player game, players send moves directly to each other. Multi-player games emerged later. ''[[Diplomacy (game)|Diplomacy]]'' is an example of this type in which a central [[game master]] manages the game, receiving moves and publishing adjudications. ''Diplomacy'' was first played by mail in 1963.<ref name=babcock/> In the early 1970s, in the United States, [[Rick Loomis]], of [[Flying Buffalo Inc]], began a number of multi-player play-by-mail games;<ref>{{Cite journal |first= Rick|last= Loomis|authorlink= |coauthors= |year= 2013|month= |title= Letter from Rick Loomis to the Play By Mail/Email/Web/Turn Based Games Community |journal= Suspense and Decision|volume= December 2013|issue= 2|pages= 38|id= |url= http://playbymail.net/SuspenseAndDecision/Issue2.pdf |accessdate= March 20, 2020|quote= }}</ref> this included games such as ''[[Nuclear Destruction (play-by-mail)|Nuclear Destruction]]'', which launched in 1970.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.flyingbuffalo.com/nucdest.htm|title= Nuclear Destruction|author= |date= |work= Flying Buffalo, Inc|publisher= Flying Buffalo, Inc|accessdate= March 27, 2020}}</ref>\n\nThis began the professional PBM industry in the United States. Professional game moderation started in 1971 at Flying Buffalo which added games such as [[Battleplan (play-by-mail game)|''Battleplan'']], ''[[Heroic Fantasy]]'', ''[[Starweb]]'', and others, which by the late 1980s were all computer moderated.<ref name=Townsend>{{cite magazine |last= Townsend|first= Jim|date= 1988|title= The PBM Corner|url= |magazine= [[White Wolf Magazine]]|location= |publisher= | issue = 11|page= 20|access-date=}}</ref> For approximately five years, Flying Buffalo was the single dominant company in the US PBM industry until [[Schubel & Son]] entered the field in \"roughly\" 1976 with the human-moderated ''[[The Tribes of Crane|Tribes of Crane]]'' game.<ref name=Townsend/> Schubel & Son introduced fee structure innovations which allowed players to pay additional fees for additional options or special actions outside of the rules. This provided players with larger bankrolls the advantage or the ability to abuse game systems.<ref name=Townsend/>\n\nThe next \"big entrance\" was [[Superior Simulations]] with its game ''[[Empyrean Challenge]]'' in 1978.<ref name=Townsend/> Reviewer Jim Townsend asserted that it was \"the most complex game system on Earth\" with some large position turn results 1,000 pages in length.<ref name=Townsend/> By 1980, the PBM field was growing but still nascent: there were still only two sizable commercial PBM companies, and only a few small ones.<ref name=Poplizio>{{cite magazine |last1= Popolizio|first1= Mike |last2= LeBlanc|first2= Liz |last3= Popolizio|first3= Marti |date= 1990|title= Revamping a Classic!

According to Jim Townsend: <blockquote>In the late 70's and all of the 80's, many small PBM firms have opened their doors and better than 90% of them have failed. Although PBM is an easy industry to get into, staying in business is another thing entirely. Literally hundreds of PBM companies have come and gone, most of them taking the money of would-be-customers with them.<ref name=Townsend/></blockquote>\n\nTownsend emphasized the risks for the PBM industry in that \"The new PBM company has such a small chance of surviving that no insurance company would write a policy to cover them. Skydivers are a better risk.\"<ref name=Townsend89>{{cite magazine |last= Townsend|first= Jim|date= February 1989|title= The PBM Corner|url= |magazine= [[White Wolf Magazine]]|location= |publisher= | issue = 14|page= 55|access-date=}}</ref> By the late 1980s, of the more than one hundred play-by-mail companies operating, the majority were hobbies\u2013not run as businesses to make money.<ref name=Townsend12>{{cite magazine |last= Townsend|first= Jim|date= |title= The PBM Corner|url= |magazine= [[White Wolf Magazine]]|location= |publisher= | issue = 12|page= 19|access-date=}}</ref> Jim Townsend estimated that, in 1988, there were about a dozen profitable PBM companies in the United States\u2014with an additional few in the [[United Kingdom]] and the same in [[Australia]].<ref name=Townsend12/>\n\nThe proliferation of PBM companies in the 1980s supported the publication of a number of newsletters from individual play-by-mail companies as well as independent publications which focused solely on the play-by-mail gaming industry such as the relatively short-lived ''[[The Nuts & Bolts of PBM]]'' and ''[[Gaming Universal]]''. The PBM genre's \"two preeminent magazines\" of the period were [[Flagship Magazine|''Flagship'']] and ''[[Paper Mayhem]]''.<ref>{{cite news |last= Paduch|first= Sally|date= June 27, 1993 |title= Email Brings Immediacy to Play-By-Mail Games|url= |work= New York Times|location= |page= RC21|access-date= |ref= Pad93}}</ref>\n\nThe 1990s brought the onset of the digital age of computers, with many gamers shifting to digital platforms versus play-by-mail games. But with the shift to the digital age has come new opportunities as well. PBM companies have introduced play-by-email (PBeM) options or games that are run in a turn-based fashion by email only.\n\nIn the early 1990s, the PBM industry still maintained some of the momentum from the 1980s. In 1993, Flagship magazine listed 185 active play-by-mail games.<ref>{{cite magazine |last= Proctor|first= Judith|date= March\u2013April 1993|title= The PBM Corner|url= |magazine= [[White Wolf Magazine]]|location= |publisher= | issue = 35|page= 51|access-date=}}</ref> However, over time, the play-by-mail industry has gradually declined.\n\nIn 1998, ''Paper Mayhem'' magazine ceased publication suddenly after the unexpected death of its longtime editor in chief, David Webber.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://playbymail.net/SuspenseAndDecision/Issue-5-Suspense&Decision.pdf|title= Using Play By Mail in a Novel's Plot: The Story Behind for the Love of Airagos|author= Muir, Shannon |date= December 2013|work= Suspense and Decision, Vol. No. 5|publisher= PlayByMail.net|accessdate= February 15, 2020|page=14|ref= Mui13}}</ref> The last of the play-by-mail magazines started in the 1980s, ''Flagship'', went out of print in 2010.

An average PBM game has 10\u201320 players in it, but there are also games that have hundreds of players. Turn around time is the length of time it takes to get your turn back from a company. The average turnaround time is 2 weeks. Some games never end. They can go on virtually forever or until you decide to drop. Many games have victory conditions that can be achieved within a year or two. Prices vary for the different PBM games, but the average price per turn [in 1993] is about $5.00.<ref name=frontmatter/></blockquote>\n\n===Mechanics===\nAfter the initial setup of a PBM game, players begin submitting turn orders. In general, players fill out a turn sheet for a game and mail it back to the gaming company.<ref name=frontmatter>{{Cite journal |last= Paper Mayhem|authorlink= |year= 1993|title= Front Matter|journal= Paper Mayhem: The Informative Play by Mail Magazine|volume= Jan/Feb 1993|issue= #58|pages= 1|id= |url= |accessdate= |quote= }}</ref> The company processes the turns and sends back turns sheets to the players so they can make subsequent moves.<ref name=frontmatter/>\n\nR.

According to John Kevin Loth III, 100 percent computer moderated games would also kill a player's \"character or empire\" emotionlessly, regardless of effort invested.<ref name=Loth86/> Alternatively, Loth noted that those preferring exquisite pages of prose would gravitate toward 100 percent human moderation.<ref name=Loth86/> Loth provided ''Beyond the Quadra Zone'' and ''Earthwood'' as popular computer moderated examples in 1986 and ''Silverdawn'' and ''Sword Lords'' as 100 percent human moderated examples of the period.<ref name=Loth86/>\n\n===Complexity===\nAccording to John Kevin Loth, \"Novices should appreciate that some games are best played by veterans.\"<ref name=Loth86/> He noted in 1986 that Midguard was a \"very complex game\" with a 100-page instruction manual and \"255 possible line entries\".<ref name=Loth86/> <ref name=Townsend/> Reviewer Jim Townsend asserted that ''[[Empyrean Challenge]]'' was \"the most complex game system on Earth\".<ref name=Townsend/> Other games, like Galactic Prisoners began simply and gradually increased in complexity.<ref name=Loth86/>\n\n===Role===\nPlay-by-mail games provide a wide array of possible [[Role-playing game|roles to play]], from pirates to space characters to \"previously unknown creatures\".<ref name=Loth86/> Loth advises that closer identification with a role increases enjoyment, but a higher importance of this aspect equates to more required searching for the right PBM game.<ref name=Loth86/>\n\n==Cost and turn processing time==\nLoth noted that, in 1986, $3\u20135 per turn was the most prevalent cost.<ref name=Loth86a>{{Cite magazine |first= John Kevin|last= Loth |date=March\u2013April 1986 |title= A PBM Primer |magazine= [[Paper Mayhem]] |number=17|page= 43 |ref= }}</ref> At the time, some games were free, while some costed as much as $100 per turn.<ref name=Loth86a/>\n\nPlay-by-mail magazine ''Paper Mayhem'' stated that the average turn processing time in 1993 was two weeks, and Loth noted that this was also the most popular.<ref name=frontmatter/><ref name=Loth86a/> In 1986, play-by-email was a nascent service only being offered by the largest PBM companies.<ref name=Loth86a/>\n\n==Information Sources==\nJohn Kevin Loth stated that, in 1986, the \"three major information sources in PBM\" were ''Paper Mayhem'', ''Flagship Magazine'', and [[Play By Mail Association]].<ref name=Loth86a/> Minor sources included magazines such as \"[[Different Worlds]], [[Dragon Magazine|Dragon]], [[Game New]], [[Imagine (game magazine)|Imagine]], and [[White Dwarf (magazine)|White Dwarf]]\".<ref name=Loth86a/> Game and company-specific publications also provided significant information, as well as \"alliances, associations, and senior players\".<ref name=Loth86a/> [[White Wolf Magazine]] also began a regular PBM column beginning in issue #11 as well as publishing an annual PBM issue.<ref>{{cite magazine |last= Townsend|first= Jim|date= 1988|title= Contents|url= |magazine= [[White Wolf Magazine]]|location= |publisher= | issue = 11|page= 2|access-date=}}</ref><ref>{{cite magazine |last= Townsend|first= Jim|date= June\u2013July 1991|title= The PBM Corner|url= |magazine= [[White Wolf Magazine]]|location= |publisher= | issue = 27|page= 2|access-date=}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of play-by-mail games]]\n* [[Play-by-post role-playing game]]\n* [[Turn-based]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* {{cite web |url= http://suspense-and-decision.com/|title= Suspense and Decision Magazine: A PBM magazine for the 21st Century!|author= |date= 2019|publisher= www.playbymail.net|accessdate= January 21, 2020}}\n*[https://books.google.com/books?id=wMWvRHsEnP8C&lpg=PA220&ots=LNSkvZD7QN&dq=pbem%20game%20magazine&pg=PA220#v=onepage&q=pbem%20game%20magazine&f=true Readers Digest 1,001 Computer Hints and Tips]\n\n[[Category:Correspondence chess]]\n[[Category:Game terminology]]\n[[Category:Play-by-email video games| ]]\n[[Category:Play-by-mail games| ]]\n", "name_user": "Airborne84", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eInformation Sources", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Play-by-mail_game"}
