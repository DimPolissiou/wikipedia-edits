Cannon]] and [[William Thurston]] called \"Group-invariant Peano curves\". The preprint remained unpublished until 2007 <ref name=\"CT07\"/>, but in the meantime had generated numerous follow-up works by other researchers.<ref>  Darryl McCullough, MR2326947 (2008i:57016), [[Mathematical Reviews]], Review of: J. W. Cannon and W. P. Thurston, Group invariant Peano curves, Geom. Topol. '''11''' (2007), 1315\u20131355; <small>\n'This influential paper dates from the mid-1980's. Indeed, preprint versions are referenced in more than 30 published articles, going back as early as 1990.' </small> </ref>\n\nIn their paper Cannon and Thurston considered the following situation. Let ''M'' be a closed [[hyperbolic 3-manifold]] that fibers over the circle with fiber ''S''. Then ''S'' itself is a closed hyperbolic surface, and its [[universal cover]] <math>\\tilde S</math> can be identified with the [[hyperbolic plane]] <math>\\mathbb H^2</math>. Similarly, the universal cover of ''M'' can be identified with the [[hyperbolic space|hyperbolic 3-space]] <math>\\mathbb H^3</math>. The inclusion <math> S\\subseteq M</math> lifts to a <math>\\pi_1(S)</math>-invariant inclusion <math>\\tilde S=\\mathbb H^2\\subseteq \\mathbb H^3=\\tilde M</math>. This inclusion is highly distorted because the action of <math>\\pi_1(S)</math> on \n<math>\\mathbb H^3</math> is not [[geometrically finite group|geometrically finite]].\n\nNevertheless, Cannon and Thurston proved that this distorted inclusion  <math>\\mathbb H^2\\subseteq \\mathbb H^3</math> extends to a continuous <math>\\pi_1(S)</math>-equivarinat map \n:<math>j:\\mathbb S^1\\to \\mathbb S^2</math>, \nwhere <math>\\mathbb S^1=\\partial \\mathbb H^2</math> and <math>\\mathbb S^2=\\partial \\mathbb H^3</math>. Moreover, in this case the map ''j'' is [[surjective]], so that it provides a continuous onto function from the circle onto the 2-sphere, that is, a [[space-filling curve]].\n\nCannon and Thurston also explicitly described the map <math>j:\\mathbb S^1\\to \\mathbb S^2</math>, via collapsing stable and unstable laminations of the monodromy [[Pseudo-Anosov map|pseudo-Anosov homeomorphism]] of ''S'' for this fibration of ''M''. In particular, this description implies that the map ''j'' is uniformly finite-to-one, with the pre-image of every point of <math>\\mathbb S^2</math> having cardinality at most ''2g'', where ''g'' is the genus of ''S''.\n\nAfter the paper of Cannon and Thurston generated a large amount of follow-up work, with other researchers analyzing the existence or non-existence of analogs of the map ''j'' in various other set-ups motivated by the Cannon\u2013Thurston result.\n\n==Cannon-Thurston maps and [[Kleinian group]]s==\n\n===Kleinian representations of surface groups===\n\nThe original example of Cannon and Thurston can be thought of in terms of [[Kleinian group|Kleinian]] representations of the [[surface group]] <math>H=\\pi_1(S)</math>. As a subgroup of <math>G=\\pi_1(M)</math>, the group ''H'' acts on <math>\\mathbb H^3=\\tilde M</math> by isometries, and this action is [[properly discontinuous]]. Thus one gets a discrete representation <math> \\rho:H\\to \\mathbb PSL(2,\\mathbb C)=Isom_+(\\mathbb H^3)</math>.\n\nThe group <math>H=\\pi_1(S)</math> also acts by isometries, properly discontinuously and co-compactly, on the universal cover <math>\\mathbb H^2=\\tilde S</math>, with the [[limit set]] <math>\\Lambda H\\subseteq \\partial H^2=\\mathbb S^1</math> being equal to <math>\\mathbb S^1</math>. The Cannon\u2013Thurston result can be interpreted as saying that these actions of ''H'' on <math>\\mathbb H^2</math> and <math>\\mathbb H^3</math> induce a continuous ''H''-equivariant map <math>j:\\mathbb S^1\\to \\mathbb S^2</math>. \n\nOne can ask, given a hyperbolic surface ''S'' and a discrete representation <math> \\rho:\\pi_1(S)\\to \\mathbb PSL(2,\\mathbb C)</math>, if there exists an induced continuous map <math>j:\\Lambda H\\to \\mathbb S^2</math>.\n\nFor Kleinian representations of surface groups, the most general result in this direction is due to [[Mahan Mj]] (2014).<ref name=Mj14>{{cite journal|title=Cannon-Thurston maps for surface groups|author=Mahan Mj|journal=[[Annals of Mathematics]]|volume=179|issue=1|year=2014|pages=1-80|MR=3126566|doi=10.4007/annals.2014.179.1.1}} </ref>\nLet ''S'' be a complete connected finite volume hyperbolic surface. Thus ''S'' is a surface without boundary, with a finite (possibly empty) set of cusps. Then one still has <math>\\mathbb H^2=\\tilde S</math> and <math>\\Lambda \\pi_1(S)=\\mathbb S^1</math> (even if ''S'' has some cusps). In this setting Mj<ref name=Mj14/> proved the following theorem: \n\n\n:Let ''S'' be a complete connected finite volume hyperbolic surface and let <math>H=\\pi_1(S)</math>. Let <math> \\rho: H\\to \\mathbb PSL(2,\\mathbb C)</math> be a discrete faithful representation without accidental parabolics. Then <math>\\rho</math> induces a continuous ''H''-equivariant map <math>j:\\mathbb S^1\\to \\mathbb S^2</math>.\n\nHere the ``without accidental parabolics\" assumption means that for <math>1\\ne h\\in H</math>, the element <math>\\rho(h)</math> is a parabolic isometry of <math>\\mathbb H^3</math> if and only if <math>h</math> is a parabolic isometry of <math>\\mathbb H^2</math>.  One of important applications of this result is that in the above situation the limit set <math>\\Lambda \\rho(\\pi_1(S))\\subseteq \\mathbb S^2</math> is locally connected.\n\nThis result of Mj was preceded by numerous other results in the same direction, such as [[Yair Minsky|Minsky]] (1994)<ref>{{cite journal|author=Yair Minsky|title=On rigidity, limit sets, and end invariants of hyperbolic 3-manifolds|journal=[[Journal of the American Mathematical Society]]|volume=7|year=1994|pages=539\u2013588|MR=1257060|doi=10.2307/2152785|url=https://www.ams.org/journals/jams/1994-07-03/S0894-0347-1994-1257060-3/S0894-0347-1994-1257060-3.pdf}} </ref>, Alperin, Dicks and Porti (1999),<ref> {{cite journal|authors=Roger C.

Then <math>\\rho</math> induces a continuous ''G''-equivariant map <math>j:\\partial G\\to \\mathbb S^2</math>, where <math>\\partial G</math> is the [[Gromov boundary]] of ''G'', and where the image of ''j'' is the [[limit set]] of ''G'' in <math>\\mathbb S^2</math>.\n\nHere ``induces\" means that the map <math>J: G\\cup \\partial G\\to \\mathbb H^3 \\cup \\mathbb S^2</math> is continuous, where <math>J|_{\\partial G}=j</math> and <math>J(g)=gx_0, g\\in G</math> (for some basepoint <math>x_0\\in \\mathbb H^3</math>). In the same paper Mj obtains a more general version of this result, allowing ''G'' to contain parabolics, under some extra technical assumptions on ''G''. He also provided a description of the fibers of ''j'' in terms of [[Ending lamination theorem|ending laminations]] of <math>\\mathbb H^3/G</math>.\n\n==Cannon-Thurston maps and [[word-hyperbolic group]]s==\n\n===Existence and non-existence results===\n\nLet ''G'' be a [[word-hyperbolic group]] and let ''H\u2264G'' be a subgroup such that ''H'' is also word-hyperbolic. If the inclusion ''i:H\u2192G'' extends to a continuous map ''\u2202i: \u2202H \u2192 \u2202G'' between their hyperbolic boundaries, the map  ''\u2202i'' is called a '''Cannon\u2013Thurston map'''. Here ``extends\" means that the map between hyperbolic compactifications <math>\\hat i: H\\cup \\partial H\\to G\\cup \\partial G</math>, given by <math>\\hat i|_H=i, \\hat i|_{\\partial H}=\\partial i</math>, is continuous. In this setting, if the map ''\u2202i'' exists, it is unique and ''H''-equivarinat, and the image ''\u2202i(\u2202H)'' is equal to the [[limit set]] <math>\\Lambda_{\\partial G}(H)</math>.\n\nIf ''H\u2264G'' is [[Quasi-isometry#Definition|quasi-isometrically embedded]] (i.e. quasiconvex) subgroup, then the Cannon\u2013Thurston map ''\u2202i: \u2202H \u2192 \u2202G'' exists and is a [[topological embedding]].\nHowever, it turns out that the Cannon-Thurston map exists in many other situations as well.\n\nMitra proved that if ''G'' is word-hyperbolic and ''H\u2264G'' is a [[normal subgroup|normal]] word-hyperbolic subgroup, then the Cannon-Thurston map exists. (In this case if ''H'' and ''Q=G/H'' are infinite then ''H'' is not quasiconvex in ''G''.) The original Cannon\u2013Thurston theorem about fibered hyperbolic 3-manifolds is a special case of this result.\n\nIf ''H\u2264G'' are two word-hyperbolic groups and ''H'' is normal in ''G'' then, by a result of Mosher,<ref>{{cite journal|MR=1443845|author=Lee Mosher|title=A hyperbolic-by-hyperbolic hyperbolic group|journal=[[Proceedings of the American Mathematical Society]]|volume=125|year=1997|issue=12|pages=3447\u20133455}} </ref> the quotient group ''Q=G/H'' is also word-hyperbolic. In this setting Mitra also described the fibers of the map ''\u2202i: \u2202H \u2192 \u2202G'' interms of ``algebraic ending laminations\" on ''H'', parameterized by the boundary points ''z\u2208\u2202Q''.\n\nIn another paper<ref name=Mitra98>{{cite journal|author=Mahan Mitra, Mahan|title=Cannon-Thurston maps for trees of hyperbolic metric spaces.|journal=[[Journal of Differential Geometry]]|volume=48|year=1998|issue=1|pages=135\u2013164}} </ref> Mitra considered the case where a word-hyperbolic group ''G'' splits as the [[graph of groups|fundamental group of a graph of groups]], where all vertex and edge groups are word-hyperbolic, and the edge-monomorphisms are [[Quasi-isometry#Definition|quasi-isometric embeddings]].

The preprint remained unpublished until 2007 <ref name=\"CT07\"/>, but in the meantime had generated numerous follow-up works by other researchers.<ref>  Darryl McCullough, MR2326947 (2008i:57016), [[Mathematical Reviews]], Review of: J. W. Cannon and W. P. Thurston, Group invariant Peano curves, Geom. Topol. '''11''' (2007), 1315\u20131355; <small>\n'This influential paper dates from the mid-1980's. Indeed, preprint versions are referenced in more than 30 published articles, going back as early as 1990.' </small> </ref>\n\nIn their paper Cannon and Thurston considered the following situation. Let ''M'' be a closed [[hyperbolic 3-manifold]] that fibers over the circle with fiber ''S''. Then ''S'' itself is a closed hyperbolic surface, and its [[universal cover]] <math>\\tilde S</math> can be identified with the [[hyperbolic plane]] <math>\\mathbb H^2</math>. Similarly, the universal cover of ''M'' can be identified with the [[hyperbolic space|hyperbolic 3-space]] <math>\\mathbb H^3</math>. The inclusion <math> S\\subseteq M</math> lifts to a <math>\\pi_1(S)</math>-invariant inclusion <math>\\tilde S=\\mathbb H^2\\subseteq \\mathbb H^3=\\tilde M</math>. This inclusion is highly distorted because the action of <math>\\pi_1(S)</math> on \n<math>\\mathbb H^3</math> is not [[geometrically finite group|geometrically finite]].\n\nNevertheless, Cannon and Thurston proved that this distorted inclusion  <math>\\mathbb H^2\\subseteq \\mathbb H^3</math> extends to a continuous <math>\\pi_1(S)</math>-equivarinat map \n:<math>j:\\mathbb S^1\\to \\mathbb S^2</math>, \nwhere <math>\\mathbb S^1=\\partial \\mathbb H^2</math> and <math>\\mathbb S^2=\\partial \\mathbb H^3</math>. Moreover, in this case the map ''j'' is [[surjective]], so that it provides a continuous onto function from the circle onto the 2-sphere, that is, a [[space-filling curve]].\n\nCannon and Thurston also explicitly described the map <math>j:\\mathbb S^1\\to \\mathbb S^2</math>, via collapsing stable and unstable laminations of the monodromy [[Pseudo-Anosov map|pseudo-Anosov homeomorphism]] of ''S'' for this fibration of ''M''. In particular, this description implies that the map ''j'' is uniformly finite-to-one, with the pre-image of every point of <math>\\mathbb S^2</math> having cardinality at most ''2g'', where ''g'' is the genus of ''S''.\n\nAfter the paper of Cannon and Thurston generated a large amount of follow-up work, with other researchers analyzing the existence or non-existence of analogs of the map ''j'' in various other set-ups motivated by the Cannon\u2013Thurston result.\n\n==Cannon-Thurston maps and [[Kleinian group]]s==\n\n===Kleinian representations of surface groups===\n\nThe original example of Cannon and Thurston can be thought of in terms of [[Kleinian group|Kleinian]] representations of the [[surface group]] <math>H=\\pi_1(S)</math>. As a subgroup of <math>G=\\pi_1(M)</math>, the group ''H'' acts on <math>\\mathbb H^3=\\tilde M</math> by isometries, and this action is [[properly discontinuous]]. Thus one gets a discrete representation <math> \\rho:H\\to \\mathbb PSL(2,\\mathbb C)=Isom_+(\\mathbb H^3)</math>.\n\nThe group <math>H=\\pi_1(S)</math> also acts by isometries, properly discontinuously and co-compactly, on the universal cover <math>\\mathbb H^2=\\tilde S</math>, with the [[limit set]] <math>\\Lambda H\\subseteq \\partial H^2=\\mathbb S^1</math> being equal to <math>\\mathbb S^1</math>. The Cannon\u2013Thurston result can be interpreted as saying that these actions of ''H'' on <math>\\mathbb H^2</math> and <math>\\mathbb H^3</math> induce a continuous ''H''-equivariant map <math>j:\\mathbb S^1\\to \\mathbb S^2</math>. \n\nOne can ask, given a hyperbolic surface ''S'' and a discrete representation <math> \\rho:\\pi_1(S)\\to \\mathbb PSL(2,\\mathbb C)</math>, if there exists an induced continuous map <math>j:\\Lambda H\\to \\mathbb S^2</math>.\n\nFor Kleinian representations of surface groups, the most general result in this direction is due to [[Mahan Mj]] (2014).<ref name=Mj14>{{cite journal|title=Cannon-Thurston maps for surface groups|author=Mahan Mj|journal=[[Annals of Mathematics]]|volume=179|issue=1|year=2014|pages=1-80|MR=3126566|doi=10.4007/annals.2014.179.1.1}} </ref>\nLet ''S'' be a complete connected finite volume hyperbolic surface. Thus ''S'' is a surface without boundary, with a finite (possibly empty) set of cusps. Then one still has <math>\\mathbb H^2=\\tilde S</math> and <math>\\Lambda \\pi_1(S)=\\mathbb S^1</math> (even if ''S'' has some cusps). In this setting Mj<ref name=Mj14/> proved the following theorem: \n\n\n:Let ''S'' be a complete connected finite volume hyperbolic surface and let <math>H=\\pi_1(S)</math>. Let <math> \\rho: H\\to \\mathbb PSL(2,\\mathbb C)</math> be a discrete faithful representation without accidental parabolics. Then <math>\\rho</math> induces a continuous ''H''-equivariant map <math>j:\\mathbb S^1\\to \\mathbb S^2</math>.\n\nHere the ``without accidental parabolics\" assumption means that for <math>1\\ne h\\in H</math>, the element <math>\\rho(h)</math> is a parabolic isometry of <math>\\mathbb H^3</math> if and only if <math>h</math> is a parabolic isometry of <math>\\mathbb H^2</math>.  One of important applications of this result is that in the above situation the limit set <math>\\Lambda \\rho(\\pi_1(S))\\subseteq \\mathbb S^2</math> is locally connected.\n\nThis result of Mj was preceded by numerous other results in the same direction, such as [[Yair Minsky|Minsky]] (1994)<ref>{{cite journal|author=Yair Minsky|title=On rigidity, limit sets, and end invariants of hyperbolic 3-manifolds|journal=[[Journal of the American Mathematical Society]]|volume=7|year=1994|pages=539\u2013588|MR=1257060|doi=10.2307/2152785|url=https://www.ams.org/journals/jams/1994-07-03/S0894-0347-1994-1257060-3/S0894-0347-1994-1257060-3.pdf}} </ref>, Alperin, Dicks and Porti (1999),<ref> {{cite journal|authors=Roger C.

In the same paper Mj obtains a more general version of this result, allowing ''G'' to contain parabolics, under some extra technical assumptions on ''G''. He also provided a description of the fibers of ''j'' in terms of [[Ending lamination theorem|ending laminations]] of <math>\\mathbb H^3/G</math>.\n\n==Cannon-Thurston maps and [[word-hyperbolic group]]s==\n\n===Existence and non-existence results===\n\nLet ''G'' be a [[word-hyperbolic group]] and let ''H\u2264G'' be a subgroup such that ''H'' is also word-hyperbolic. If the inclusion ''i:H\u2192G'' extends to a continuous map ''\u2202i: \u2202H \u2192 \u2202G'' between their hyperbolic boundaries, the map  ''\u2202i'' is called a '''Cannon\u2013Thurston map'''. Here ``extends\" means that the map between hyperbolic compactifications <math>\\hat i: H\\cup \\partial H\\to G\\cup \\partial G</math>, given by <math>\\hat i|_H=i, \\hat i|_{\\partial H}=\\partial i</math>, is continuous. In this setting, if the map ''\u2202i'' exists, it is unique and ''H''-equivarinat, and the image ''\u2202i(\u2202H)'' is equal to the [[limit set]] <math>\\Lambda_{\\partial G}(H)</math>.\n\nIf ''H\u2264G'' is [[Quasi-isometry#Definition|quasi-isometrically embedded]] (i.e. quasiconvex) subgroup, then the Cannon\u2013Thurston map ''\u2202i: \u2202H \u2192 \u2202G'' exists and is a [[topological embedding]].\nHowever, it turns out that the Cannon-Thurston map exists in many other situations as well.\n\nMitra proved that if ''G'' is word-hyperbolic and ''H\u2264G'' is a [[normal subgroup|normal]] word-hyperbolic subgroup, then the Cannon-Thurston map exists. (In this case if ''H'' and ''Q=G/H'' are infinite then ''H'' is not quasiconvex in ''G''.) The original Cannon\u2013Thurston theorem about fibered hyperbolic 3-manifolds is a special case of this result.\n\nIf ''H\u2264G'' are two word-hyperbolic groups and ''H'' is normal in ''G'' then, by a result of Mosher,<ref>{{cite journal|MR=1443845|author=Lee Mosher|title=A hyperbolic-by-hyperbolic hyperbolic group|journal=[[Proceedings of the American Mathematical Society]]|volume=125|year=1997|issue=12|pages=3447\u20133455}} </ref> the quotient group ''Q=G/H'' is also word-hyperbolic.

The first school was established by William Bindall on Chisholm Street with 17 students.\n\nGold was found nearby at [[Beechworth]] in February 1852 and by the end of the year more than 8,000 prospectors rushed the fields of Ovens and Beechworth.  Wangaratta became a major service centre to these goldfields. As a result, the first bridge over the Ovens was completed in early 1855.  \n \nA seven-member council incorporated the [[Borough of Wangaratta]] on 19 June 1863.\n\nThe 1870s saw the settlement establish a number of key infrastructure and services including the first water supply.

The reason for this arrangement is that the area beyond the rivers, to the north and east of the business district, was until the 1990s prone to flooding and so unsuitable for building. Levees were constructed in the 1990s to alleviate the flooding, however development in this area has been slow.\n\nNotable buildings include the [[Holy Trinity Cathedral, Wangaratta|Holy Trinity]] [[Anglican Church of Australia|Anglican]] [[Cathedral]] and its Cathedral Close, St. Patrick's Catholic Church and the eccentric [[Art Deco|art d\u00e9co]] courthouse.\n\n==Climate==\nSince the warmest month mean reaches {{convert|22|C}}, Wangaratta would have a [[humid subtropical climate]] (''Cfa'' in the [[K\u00f6ppen climate classification]]).<ref name=\"SpechtRundel2012\">{{cite book|authors=R.L.

April is the driest month; June is the wettest. Despite its location close to the [[Snowy Mountains]] and the ski fields, Wangaratta does not get severely cold or snowy in winter and daytime maximum temperatures are rather mild, although cold air drifting down from the mountains can cause frosty mornings during clear winter nights.\n\nRain falls as thunderstorms in the summer, and in winter with [[cold fronts]]. Occasional severe [[heat wave]]s are caused by hot, dry air from the [[Deserts in Australia|central deserts of Australia]] moving over the area. Temperatures of {{convert|40|C}} and slightly above occur 2\u20134 times a year on average; however, heatwaves are often succeeded by [[cold fronts]], which cause a significant drop in the temperature.
