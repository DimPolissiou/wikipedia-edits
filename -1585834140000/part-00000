The Cardinals' original home ballpark was [[Sportsman's Park]] from 1882 to 1892 when they played in the [[American Association (19th century)|American Association]] and were known as the Browns.  [[1893 St. Louis Browns season|In 1893]], the Browns moved to a new ballpark five blocks northwest of Sportsman's Park which would serve as their home from 1893 to 1920.  The new park was originally called New Sportsman's Park but became more commonly referred to as [[Robison Field]].<ref name=\"Timeline1\" /> Midway through the 1920 season the Cardinals abandoned Robison Field and returned to the original Sportsman's Park and became tenants of their American League rivals, the [[St. Louis Browns]].  In 1953, the [[Anheuser-Busch|Anheuser-Busch Brewery]] purchased the Cardinals and the new owner subsequently also purchased Sportsman's Park from the Browns and renamed it Busch Stadium, later becoming Busch I. The Browns then left St. Louis for [[Baltimore]] after the season, becoming the Orioles. The Cardinals built [[Busch Memorial Stadium]], or Busch II, in downtown St. Louis, opened it during the 1966 season and played there until 2005.<ref name=\"Timeline4\" /> It was built as the [[multi-purpose stadium]] home of both the baseball Cardinals and the [[History of the St. Louis Cardinals (NFL)|NFL football Cardinals]], who are now the [[Arizona Cardinals]]; the NFL's [[Los Angeles Rams|Rams]] also played the first four games of their home schedule upon their arrival in St. Louis in 1995. The current Busch Stadium was constructed adjacent to, and partly atop, the site of Busch Memorial Stadium.\n\n===Spring training===\nThe Cardinals home field in [[spring training]] is [[Roger Dean Stadium]] in [[Jupiter, Florida]].  They share the complex, which opened in 1998, with the [[Miami Marlins]].  Before moving to Jupiter, the Cardinals hosted spring training at [[Al Lang Field]] in [[St. Petersburg, Florida]] from 1937 to 1997.\n\n===Regular season home attendance===\nThe Cardinals have exceeded the attendance total of 3 million every season since 2004.\n{| cellpadding=\"10\"\n|- style=\"text-align:left; vertical-align:top;\"\n|\n|\n{| cellpadding=\"1\" style=\"width:300px; font-size:90%; border:2px solid #C41E3A;\"\n|- style=\"text-align:center; font-size:larger;\"\n| colspan=5 style=\"{{Baseball primary style|St. Louis Cardinals}};\"|'''Home Attendance at Busch Stadium'''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/STL/attend.shtml |title=St. Louis Cardinals Attendance, Stadiums, and Park Factors |publisher=Baseball-Reference.com |date= |accessdate=May 5, 2018}}</ref>\n|- style={{Baseball secondary style|St. Louis Cardinals}};\"\n| '''Year''' || '''Total attendance''' || '''Game average''' || '''League rank'''\n|-\n| [[1996 St. Louis Cardinals season|1996]]\n| 2,654,758\n| 32,774\n| 4th\n|-\n| [[1997 St. Louis Cardinals season|1997]]\n| 2,634,014\n| 32,519\n| 4th\n|-\n| [[1998 St. Louis Cardinals season|1998]]\n| 3,195,691\n| 38,972\n| 4th\n|-\n| [[1999 St. Louis Cardinals season|1999]]\n| 3,225,334\n| 40,317\n| 4th\n|-\n| [[2000 St. Louis Cardinals season|2000]]\n| 3,396,493\n| 41,191\n| 1st\n|-\n| [[2001 St. Louis Cardinals season|2001]]\n| 3,109,578\n| 37,922\n| 3rd\n|-\n| [[2002 St. Louis Cardinals season|2002]]\n| 3,011,756\n| 37,182\n| 4th\n|-\n| [[2003 St. Louis Cardinals season|2003]]\n| 2,910,386\n| 35,931\n| 4th\n|-\n| [[2004 St. Louis Cardinals season|2004]]\n| 3,048,427\n| 37,635\n| 6th\n|-\n| [[2005 St. Louis Cardinals season|2005]]\n| 3,538,988\n| 43,691\n| 2nd\n|-\n| [[2006 St. Louis Cardinals season|2006]]\n| 3,407,104\n| 42,589\n| 2nd\n|-\n| [[2007 St. Louis Cardinals season|2007]]\n| 3,552,180\n| 43,854\n| 3rd\n|-\n| [[2008 St. Louis Cardinals season|2008]]\n| 3,432,917\n| 42,382\n| 3rd\n|-\n| [[2009 St. Louis Cardinals season|2009]]\n| 3,343,252\n| 41,275\n| 3rd\n|-\n| [[2010 St. Louis Cardinals season|2010]]\n| 3,301,218\n| 40,756\n| 3rd\n|-\n| [[2011 St. Louis Cardinals season|2011]]\n| 3,093,954\n| 38,197\n| 3rd\n|-\n| [[2012 St. Louis Cardinals season|2012]]\n| 3,262,109\n| 40,273\n| 4th\n|-\n| [[2013 St. Louis Cardinals season|2013]]\n| 3,369,769\n| 41,602\n| 2nd\n|-\n| [[2014 St. Louis Cardinals season|2014]]\n| 3,540,649\n| 43,712\n| 2nd\n|-\n| [[2015 St. Louis Cardinals season|2015]]\n| 3,520,889\n| 43,467\n| 2nd\n|-\n| [[2016 St. Louis Cardinals season|2016]]\n| 3,444,490\n| 42,524\n| 2nd\n|-\n| [[2017 St. Louis Cardinals season|2017]]\n| 3,448,337\n| 42,572\n| 2nd\n|-\n| [[2018 St. Louis Cardinals season|2018]]\n| 3,403,587\n| 42,020\n| 2nd\n|-\n| [[2019 St. Louis Cardinals season|2019]]\n| 3,480,393\n| 42,968\n| 2nd\n|}\n|}\n\n==Logos and uniforms==\nThe Cardinals have had few logos throughout their history, although those logos have evolved over time.  The first logo associated with the Cardinals was an interlocking \"SL\" that appeared on the team's caps and or sleeves as early as 1900.  Those early uniforms usually featured the name \"St. Louis\" on white home and gray road uniforms which both had [[Cardinal (color)|cardinal red]] accents.  In 1920, the \"SL\" largely disappeared from the team's uniforms, and for the next 20 years the team wore caps that were white with red striping and a red bill.\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:St Louis Cardinals 1929-1948 logo.png|thumb|left|The original \"birds on the bat\" logo, which first appeared in 1922.]] -->\nIn 1922, the Cardinals wore uniforms for the first time that featured the two familiar [[Northern cardinal|cardinal]] birds perched on a [[baseball bat]] over the name \"Cardinals\" with the letter \"C\" of the word hooked over the bat.  The concept of the birds originated after [[List of St. Louis Cardinals owners and executives|general manager]] [[Branch Rickey]] noticed a colorful cardboard arrangement featuring cardinal birds on a table in a [[Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.)|Presbyterian]] [[Church (building)|church]] in [[Ferguson, Missouri]], at which he was speaking.  The arrangement's production was by a woman named Allie May Schmidt.  Schmidt's father, a [[graphic designer]], helped Ricky make the logo a familiar staple on Cardinals uniforms.<ref>{{cite news|last=Getzenburg|first=Alaina|title=Schmidt's vision inspired iconic red bird logo|url=https://www.mlb.com/news/allie-may-schmidt-inspired-cardinals-logo/c-254904614|publisher=[[MLB Advanced Media]]|date=September 18, 2017|accessdate=April 19, 2018}}</ref>  Colloquially referred to as the \"birds on the bat\", it initially appeared with the birds perched on a black bat and \"Cardinals\" in printed letters.  An alternate version of this logo with \"St. Louis\" replacing \"Cardinals\" appeared in 1930 and was the primary logo in 1931 and 1932 before \"Cardinals\" returned.  In 1940, the now-familiar \"{{sm|StL}}\" logo was introduced on the team's caps. The interlocking \"{{sm|StL}}\" has undergone several slight modifications over the years but has appeared on the team's caps every year since.  The first appearance of the \"STL\" in 1940 coincided with the introduction of navy blue as a uniform color.  From 1940 until 1955, the team wore navy blue caps with red bills and a red interlocking \"{{sm|StL}}\" while the jerseys featured both cardinal red and navy blue accents.  In 1951, the \"birds on the bat\" logo was changed to feature a yellow baseball bat.<ref name=\"Cardsunis\">{{cite web | url=http://exhibits.baseballhalloffame.org/dressed_to_the_nines/uniforms.asp?lowYear=1882&highYear=2008&city=St.%20Louis&league=NL&sort=year&increment=18&pos=19 | title=Cardinals uniforms | work=Baseball Hall of Fame Uniform Database | accessdate=May 3, 2008}}</ref>\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:St Louis Cardinals 1998-present logo.png|thumb|right|The current \"birds on the bat\" logo introduced in 1998 (although variations of this have been used since 1957).]] -->\n\nIn 1956, the Cardinals changed their caps to solid blue with a red \"{{sm|StL}}\", removing the red bill.  Also, for that season only, the Cardinals wore a script \"Cardinals\" wordmark on their uniforms excluding the \"birds on the bat.\" An updated version of the \"birds on the bat\" logo returned in 1957 with the word \"Cardinals\" written in cursive beneath the bat; this logo, with some incremental changes along the way, has been the team's logo since. In 1962, the Cardinals became the first National League team (and the second in all of Major League Baseball after the [[Chicago White Sox]] in 1960) to display players' names on the back of their jerseys. In 1964, while retaining their blue caps for road games, the Cardinals changed their [http://exhibits.baseballhalloffame.org/dressed_to_the_nines/detail_page.asp?fileName=nl_1964_stlouis.gif&Entryid=1045 home caps] to all red with a white interlocking \"{{sm|StL}}\".  The next year, the [http://exhibits.baseballhalloffame.org/dressed_to_the_nines/detail_page.asp?fileName=nl_1965_stlouis.gif&Entryid=1065 red caps] were the only cap worn by the team full-time. In 1967, the birds on the bat emblem on the jersey was again tweaked, making the birds more realistic and changing the position of their tails relative to the bat and this version remained on all Cardinals game jerseys through 1997.\n\nIn 1971, following the trend in baseball at the time, the Cardinals replaced the traditional flannel front-button shirts and pants with belts with new pullover knit jerseys and beltless elastic waist pants. In 1973, the crew-neck collar became a V-neck. Another trend in baseball led the Cardinals to change their road uniforms from gray to light blue from 1976 to 1984; the player numbers were worn on the sleeves in 1979 and 1980. In 1992, the Cardinals returned to wearing traditional button-down shirts and pants with belts. That same year, they also brought back the all-navy cap with a red \"{{sm|StL}}\" on the road (which were last worn in 1964) only while wearing the same red and white cap for home games only.  \nIn 1998, the \"birds on the bat\" was updated for the first time in 30 years with more detailed birds and bolder letters. That year, St. Louis introduced a cap featuring a single cardinal bird perched on a bat worn only on Sunday home games. The new birds on the bat design was modified again the next year, with yellow beaks and white eyes replacing the red beaks and yellow eyes of the 1998 version. Uniform numbers also returned to the front of the jerseys in 1999 after a two-year absence.<ref name=\"Cardsunis\" />\n\nOn November 16, 2012, the Cardinals unveiled a new alternate uniform to be worn at home games on Saturdays beginning with the 2013 season.{{update after|2013|04|30}}  The modified jersey, cream-colored with red trim on the sleeves and down the front, was the first since 1932 in which \"St. Louis\" will be used instead of \"Cardinals\" and retained the \"birds on the bat.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Langosch|first=Jenifer|title=City is key to Cardinals' alternate home jersey|url=http://stlouis.cardinals.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20121115&content_id=40305046&vkey=news_stl&c_id=stl|publisher=MLB Advanced Media|date=November 16, 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121119103550/http://stlouis.cardinals.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20121115&content_id=40305046&vkey=news_stl&c_id=stl|archivedate=November 19, 2012|accessdate=April 19, 2018|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> 2013 also saw the team adopt their red caps as their main cap for both home and away games for the first time since 1991; the navy cap was retained as an alternate, used mainly against other red-capped teams.

Making its \"debut\" in Game 3 of the [[2011 National League Division Series|NLDS]] on Oct 4, a squirrel ran across home plate in the middle of a pitch from [[Roy Oswalt]] of the Phillies to the Cardinals' [[Skip Schumaker]].  The Cardinals would win Game 4 and subsequently Game 5 (October 7) in Philadelphia to advance to the NLCS, symbolizing the squirrel's \"role\" in the victory.  The squirrel was popularized as \"Buschie the Rally Squirrel\"<ref>{{cite web|last=Britt |first=Crystal |url=http://www.kfvs12.com/story/15640350/busch-takes-steps-to-remove-squirrel |title=Fans hope Buschie the Rally Squirrel is good luck \u2013 KFVS12 News & Weather Cape Girardeau, Carbondale, Poplar Bluff |publisher=Kfvs12.com |date=October 7, 2011 |accessdate=December 13, 2012}}</ref> As a tribute to the popularity of the squirrel, a small depiction of the Rally Squirrel is also included on the official [[World Series ring]]s the team received. It shows up under the \"STL\" logo on the side of the ring.\n\nFredbird sparked controversy in May 2015, when he was asked by a fan for a photograph and handed him a sign that said \"Police Lives Matter\". The team later claimed that Fredbird should not be involved in any political activity or social commentary.\n\n===Rivalries===\n\n====Chicago Cubs====\n{{main|Cardinals\u2013Cubs rivalry}}\nThe Cardinals\u2013Cubs rivalry refers to games between the Cardinals and the [[Chicago Cubs]]. The rivalry is also known as the '''Downstate Illinois rivalry''' or the '''I-55 Series''' (in earlier years as the '''Route 66 Series''') as both cities are located along [[Interstate 55]] (which itself succeeded the famous [[U.S. Route 66]]). The Cubs lead the series 1,230\u20131,171, through September 2018, while the Cardinals lead in [[National League]] pennants with 19 against the Cubs' 17. The Cubs have won 11 of those pennants in Major League Baseball's Modern Era (1901\u2013present), while all 19 of the Cardinals' pennants have been won since 1926. The Cardinals also have an edge when it comes to [[World Series]] successes, having won 11 championships to the Cubs' 3. Games featuring the Cardinals and Cubs see numerous visiting fans in either [[Busch Stadium]] in St. Louis or  [[Wrigley Field]] in Chicago.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nesn.com/2011/01/cubs-cardinals-must-emulate-yankees-red-sox-to-rekindle-rivalry.html|title=Cubs, Cardinals Must Emulate Yankees, Red Sox to Rekindle Rivalry|date=January 12, 2011|accessdate=February 6, 2011|first=Tony|last=Lee|work=NESN}}</ref> When the National League split into two and then three divisions, the Cardinals and Cubs remained together. This has added excitement to several pennant races over the years.  The Cardinals and Cubs have played each other once in the postseason, [[2015 National League Division Series]], which the Cubs won 3\u20131.\n\n====Kansas City Royals====\n{{main|Cardinals\u2013Royals rivalry}}\nThe Cardinals have an [[Interleague play|interleague]] and intrastate rivalry with the [[Kansas City Royals]], dubbed the \"Show-Me Series\" after the [[Missouri#Nicknames|nickname]] of the team's home state, [[Missouri]]; or the \"I\u201370 Series\" after the [[Interstate 70|interstate highway]] that connects the cities. The teams first met in the [[1985 World Series]], which the Royals won 4\u20133, and which remains their only post-season meeting.\n\nSince interleague play began in {{mlby|1997}}, the Cardinals and Royals have met in four to six games each season, evenly split between the two cities. As of 2019, the Cardinals lead the overall series 63\u201346.\n\nThe rivalry heated up in 2015, when both teams held the best records in their respective leagues when they opened each of their two series. Had the Cardinals made it to the World Series, they would have faced the Royals in a rematch of 1985, who won the [[2015 World Series|championship]] that year.\n\n==Executives and club officials==\n{{See also|List of St. Louis Cardinals owners and executives}}\n\n===Ownership and valuation===\nAn investment group led by [[William DeWitt, Jr.]] owns the St. Louis Cardinals, having bought the team from [[Anheuser-Busch]] (AB) in 1996.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://stlcardinals.scout.com/2/824267.html |work=Scout.com |title=In defense of DeWit & Company |date=December 24, 2008 |accessdate=April 27, 2013 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130622033510/http://stlcardinals.scout.com/2/824267.html |archivedate=June 22, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>  As with other periods of the Cardinals' transaction history, doubt loomed as to whether the purchaser would keep the team in St. Louis, due to the city's status as a \"small market\", which appears to handicap a club's competitiveness.

The franchise's value grew 12.7% from 2013 to 2014.\nThe ''Forbes'' methodology of team values are enterprise values (equity plus net debt) that include the economics of the ballpark but exclude the value of real estate itself. Forbes does not include the value of team-owned regional sports networks. The league's ownership in Major League Baseball Advanced Media (100%) and the MLB Network (67%) and league's investment portfolio are included in our values. In total, these three assets constitute about $425 million in value for each team. Revenue and operating income (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) measure cash in versus cash out (not accrual accounting) for the 2017 season. Their figures include the post-season and are net of revenue sharing and stadium debt payments. Revenues include the pro-rated upfront bonuses networks pay teams as well as proceeds from non-MLB events at the ballpark.

The Cardinals' original home ballpark was [[Sportsman's Park]] from 1882 to 1892 when they played in the [[American Association (19th century)|American Association]] and were known as the Browns.  [[1893 St. Louis Browns season|In 1893]], the Browns moved to a new ballpark five blocks northwest of Sportsman's Park which would serve as their home from 1893 to 1920.  The new park was originally called New Sportsman's Park but became more commonly referred to as [[Robison Field]].<ref name=\"Timeline1\" /> Midway through the 1920 season the Cardinals abandoned Robison Field and returned to the original Sportsman's Park and became tenants of their American League rivals, the [[St. Louis Browns]].  In 1953, the [[Anheuser-Busch|Anheuser-Busch Brewery]] purchased the Cardinals and the new owner subsequently also purchased Sportsman's Park from the Browns and renamed it Busch Stadium, later becoming Busch I. The Browns then left St. Louis for [[Baltimore]] after the season, becoming the Orioles. The Cardinals built [[Busch Memorial Stadium]], or Busch II, in downtown St. Louis, opened it during the 1966 season and played there until 2005.<ref name=\"Timeline4\" /> It was built as the [[multi-purpose stadium]] home of both the baseball Cardinals and the [[History of the St. Louis Cardinals (NFL)|NFL football Cardinals]], who are now the [[Arizona Cardinals]]; the NFL's [[Los Angeles Rams|Rams]] also played the first four games of their home schedule upon their arrival in St. Louis in 1995. The current Busch Stadium was constructed adjacent to, and partly atop, the site of Busch Memorial Stadium.\n\n===Spring training===\nThe Cardinals home field in [[spring training]] is [[Roger Dean Stadium]] in [[Jupiter, Florida]].  They share the complex, which opened in 1998, with the [[Miami Marlins]].  Before moving to Jupiter, the Cardinals hosted spring training at [[Al Lang Field]] in [[St. Petersburg, Florida]] from 1937 to 1997.\n\n===Regular season home attendance===\nThe Cardinals have exceeded the attendance total of 3 million every season since 2004.\n{| cellpadding=\"10\"\n|- style=\"text-align:left; vertical-align:top;\"\n|\n|\n{| cellpadding=\"1\" style=\"width:300px; font-size:90%; border:2px solid #C41E3A;\"\n|- style=\"text-align:center; font-size:larger;\"\n| colspan=5 style=\"{{Baseball primary style|St. Louis Cardinals}};\"|'''Home Attendance at Busch Stadium'''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.baseball-reference.com/teams/STL/attend.shtml |title=St. Louis Cardinals Attendance, Stadiums, and Park Factors |publisher=Baseball-Reference.com |date= |accessdate=May 5, 2018}}</ref>\n|- style={{Baseball secondary style|St. Louis Cardinals}};\"\n| '''Year''' || '''Total attendance''' || '''Game average''' || '''League rank'''\n|-\n| [[1996 St. Louis Cardinals season|1996]]\n| 2,654,758\n| 32,774\n| 4th\n|-\n| [[1997 St. Louis Cardinals season|1997]]\n| 2,634,014\n| 32,519\n| 4th\n|-\n| [[1998 St. Louis Cardinals season|1998]]\n| 3,195,691\n| 38,972\n| 4th\n|-\n| [[1999 St. Louis Cardinals season|1999]]\n| 3,225,334\n| 40,317\n| 4th\n|-\n| [[2000 St. Louis Cardinals season|2000]]\n| 3,396,493\n| 41,191\n| 1st\n|-\n| [[2001 St. Louis Cardinals season|2001]]\n| 3,109,578\n| 37,922\n| 3rd\n|-\n| [[2002 St. Louis Cardinals season|2002]]\n| 3,011,756\n| 37,182\n| 4th\n|-\n| [[2003 St. Louis Cardinals season|2003]]\n| 2,910,386\n| 35,931\n| 4th\n|-\n| [[2004 St. Louis Cardinals season|2004]]\n| 3,048,427\n| 37,635\n| 6th\n|-\n| [[2005 St. Louis Cardinals season|2005]]\n| 3,538,988\n| 43,691\n| 2nd\n|-\n| [[2006 St. Louis Cardinals season|2006]]\n| 3,407,104\n| 42,589\n| 2nd\n|-\n| [[2007 St. Louis Cardinals season|2007]]\n| 3,552,180\n| 43,854\n| 3rd\n|-\n| [[2008 St. Louis Cardinals season|2008]]\n| 3,432,917\n| 42,382\n| 3rd\n|-\n| [[2009 St. Louis Cardinals season|2009]]\n| 3,343,252\n| 41,275\n| 3rd\n|-\n| [[2010 St. Louis Cardinals season|2010]]\n| 3,301,218\n| 40,756\n| 3rd\n|-\n| [[2011 St. Louis Cardinals season|2011]]\n| 3,093,954\n| 38,197\n| 3rd\n|-\n| [[2012 St. Louis Cardinals season|2012]]\n| 3,262,109\n| 40,273\n| 4th\n|-\n| [[2013 St. Louis Cardinals season|2013]]\n| 3,369,769\n| 41,602\n| 2nd\n|-\n| [[2014 St. Louis Cardinals season|2014]]\n| 3,540,649\n| 43,712\n| 2nd\n|-\n| [[2015 St. Louis Cardinals season|2015]]\n| 3,520,889\n| 43,467\n| 2nd\n|-\n| [[2016 St. Louis Cardinals season|2016]]\n| 3,444,490\n| 42,524\n| 2nd\n|-\n| [[2017 St. Louis Cardinals season|2017]]\n| 3,448,337\n| 42,572\n| 2nd\n|-\n| [[2018 St. Louis Cardinals season|2018]]\n| 3,403,587\n| 42,020\n| 2nd\n|-\n| [[2019 St. Louis Cardinals season|2019]]\n| 3,480,393\n| 42,968\n| 2nd\n|}\n|}\n\n==Logos and uniforms==\nThe Cardinals have had few logos throughout their history, although those logos have evolved over time.  The first logo associated with the Cardinals was an interlocking \"SL\" that appeared on the team's caps and or sleeves as early as 1900.  Those early uniforms usually featured the name \"St. Louis\" on white home and gray road uniforms which both had [[Cardinal (color)|cardinal red]] accents.  In 1920, the \"SL\" largely disappeared from the team's uniforms, and for the next 20 years the team wore caps that were white with red striping and a red bill.\n\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:St Louis Cardinals 1929-1948 logo.png|thumb|left|The original \"birds on the bat\" logo, which first appeared in 1922.]] -->\nIn 1922, the Cardinals wore uniforms for the first time that featured the two familiar [[Northern cardinal|cardinal]] birds perched on a [[baseball bat]] over the name \"Cardinals\" with the letter \"C\" of the word hooked over the bat.  The concept of the birds originated after [[List of St. Louis Cardinals owners and executives|general manager]] [[Branch Rickey]] noticed a colorful cardboard arrangement featuring cardinal birds on a table in a [[Presbyterian Church (U.S.A.)|Presbyterian]] [[Church (building)|church]] in [[Ferguson, Missouri]], at which he was speaking.  The arrangement's production was by a woman named Allie May Schmidt.  Schmidt's father, a [[graphic designer]], helped Ricky make the logo a familiar staple on Cardinals uniforms.<ref>{{cite news|last=Getzenburg|first=Alaina|title=Schmidt's vision inspired iconic red bird logo|url=https://www.mlb.com/news/allie-may-schmidt-inspired-cardinals-logo/c-254904614|publisher=[[MLB Advanced Media]]|date=September 18, 2017|accessdate=April 19, 2018}}</ref>  Colloquially referred to as the \"birds on the bat\", it initially appeared with the birds perched on a black bat and \"Cardinals\" in printed letters.  An alternate version of this logo with \"St. Louis\" replacing \"Cardinals\" appeared in 1930 and was the primary logo in 1931 and 1932 before \"Cardinals\" returned.  In 1940, the now-familiar \"{{sm|StL}}\" logo was introduced on the team's caps. The interlocking \"{{sm|StL}}\" has undergone several slight modifications over the years but has appeared on the team's caps every year since.  The first appearance of the \"STL\" in 1940 coincided with the introduction of navy blue as a uniform color.  From 1940 until 1955, the team wore navy blue caps with red bills and a red interlocking \"{{sm|StL}}\" while the jerseys featured both cardinal red and navy blue accents.  In 1951, the \"birds on the bat\" logo was changed to feature a yellow baseball bat.<ref name=\"Cardsunis\">{{cite web | url=http://exhibits.baseballhalloffame.org/dressed_to_the_nines/uniforms.asp?lowYear=1882&highYear=2008&city=St.%20Louis&league=NL&sort=year&increment=18&pos=19 | title=Cardinals uniforms | work=Baseball Hall of Fame Uniform Database | accessdate=May 3, 2008}}</ref>\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:St Louis Cardinals 1998-present logo.png|thumb|right|The current \"birds on the bat\" logo introduced in 1998 (although variations of this have been used since 1957).]] -->\n\nIn 1956, the Cardinals changed their caps to solid blue with a red \"{{sm|StL}}\", removing the red bill.  Also, for that season only, the Cardinals wore a script \"Cardinals\" wordmark on their uniforms excluding the \"birds on the bat.\" An updated version of the \"birds on the bat\" logo returned in 1957 with the word \"Cardinals\" written in cursive beneath the bat; this logo, with some incremental changes along the way, has been the team's logo since. In 1962, the Cardinals became the first National League team (and the second in all of Major League Baseball after the [[Chicago White Sox]] in 1960) to display players' names on the back of their jerseys. In 1964, while retaining their blue caps for road games, the Cardinals changed their [http://exhibits.baseballhalloffame.org/dressed_to_the_nines/detail_page.asp?fileName=nl_1964_stlouis.gif&Entryid=1045 home caps] to all red with a white interlocking \"{{sm|StL}}\".  The next year, the [http://exhibits.baseballhalloffame.org/dressed_to_the_nines/detail_page.asp?fileName=nl_1965_stlouis.gif&Entryid=1065 red caps] were the only cap worn by the team full-time. In 1967, the birds on the bat emblem on the jersey was again tweaked, making the birds more realistic and changing the position of their tails relative to the bat and this version remained on all Cardinals game jerseys through 1997.\n\nIn 1971, following the trend in baseball at the time, the Cardinals replaced the traditional flannel front-button shirts and pants with belts with new pullover knit jerseys and beltless elastic waist pants. In 1973, the crew-neck collar became a V-neck. Another trend in baseball led the Cardinals to change their road uniforms from gray to light blue from 1976 to 1984; the player numbers were worn on the sleeves in 1979 and 1980. In 1992, the Cardinals returned to wearing traditional button-down shirts and pants with belts. That same year, they also brought back the all-navy cap with a red \"{{sm|StL}}\" on the road (which were last worn in 1964) only while wearing the same red and white cap for home games only.  \nIn 1998, the \"birds on the bat\" was updated for the first time in 30 years with more detailed birds and bolder letters. That year, St. Louis introduced a cap featuring a single cardinal bird perched on a bat worn only on Sunday home games. The new birds on the bat design was modified again the next year, with yellow beaks and white eyes replacing the red beaks and yellow eyes of the 1998 version. Uniform numbers also returned to the front of the jerseys in 1999 after a two-year absence.<ref name=\"Cardsunis\" />\n\nOn November 16, 2012, the Cardinals unveiled a new alternate uniform to be worn at home games on Saturdays beginning with the 2013 season.{{update after|2013|04|30}}  The modified jersey, cream-colored with red trim on the sleeves and down the front, was the first since 1932 in which \"St. Louis\" will be used instead of \"Cardinals\" and retained the \"birds on the bat.\"<ref>{{cite news|last=Langosch|first=Jenifer|title=City is key to Cardinals' alternate home jersey|url=http://stlouis.cardinals.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20121115&content_id=40305046&vkey=news_stl&c_id=stl|publisher=MLB Advanced Media|date=November 16, 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121119103550/http://stlouis.cardinals.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20121115&content_id=40305046&vkey=news_stl&c_id=stl|archivedate=November 19, 2012|accessdate=April 19, 2018|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> 2013 also saw the team adopt their red caps as their main cap for both home and away games for the first time since 1991; the navy cap was retained as an alternate, used mainly against other red-capped teams.

The franchise's value grew 12.7% from 2013 to 2014.\nThe ''Forbes'' methodology of team values are enterprise values (equity plus net debt) that include the economics of the ballpark but exclude the value of real estate itself. Forbes does not include the value of team-owned regional sports networks. The league's ownership in Major League Baseball Advanced Media (100%) and the MLB Network (67%) and league's investment portfolio are included in our values. In total, these three assets constitute about $425 million in value for each team. Revenue and operating income (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) measure cash in versus cash out (not accrual accounting) for the 2017 season. Their figures include the post-season and are net of revenue sharing and stadium debt payments. Revenues include the pro-rated upfront bonuses networks pay teams as well as proceeds from non-MLB events at the ballpark. The non-recurring $18 million each team received in 2017 from the sale of a stake in BamTech to Walt Disney was excluded, as were profits or losses from team-owned RSNs.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/mikeozanian/2018/04/11/baseball-team-values-2018/#e4d1b593fc09 |title=Baseball Team Values 2018 |work=[[Forbes]] |date=April 11, 2018}}</ref>\n\n{| cellpadding=\"1\" style=\"width:850px; font-size:90%; border:2px solid #C41E3A;\"\n|- style=\"text-align:center; font-size:larger;\"\n| colspan=7 style=\"{{Baseball primary style|St. Louis Cardinals}};\"|'''St. Louis Cardinals' financial value since 2009'''\n|- style={{Baseball secondary style|St. Louis Cardinals}};\"\n| '''Year'''|| '''$ Franchise Value (mil.)'''<sup>1</sup> || '''$ Revenue (mil.)''' <sup>2</sup> || '''$ Operating Income (mil.)''' <sup>3</sup> || '''$ Player Expenses (mil.)''' <sup>4</sup> || '''Wins-to-player cost ratio''' <sup>5</sup> || '''Ref'''\n<!-- Franchise Value, Revenue, Operating Inc., Player Expenses, Wins-to-player cost ratio -->\n|-\n| [[2009 St. Louis Cardinals season|2009]]\n| $486\n| $195\n| $ &nbsp; 7\n| $120\n| &nbsp; 87\n|-\n| [[2010 St. Louis Cardinals season|2010]] \n| $488\n| $195\n| $12.8\n| $111\n| 100\n| <ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.forbes.com/lists/2010/33/baseball-valuations-10_St-Louis-Cardinals_333240.html |work=Forbes |title=#8 St. Louis Cardinals |date=April 7, 2010 |accessdate=November 14, 2011}}</ref>\n|-\n| [[2011 St. Louis Cardinals season|2011]] \n| $518\n| $207\n| $19.8\n| $110\n| &nbsp; 94\n| <ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.forbes.com/lists/2011/33/baseball-valuations-11_St-Louis-Cardinals_333240.html |work=Forbes |title=#11 St. Louis Cardinals |date=March 23, 2011 |accessdate=November 14, 2011}}</ref>\n|-\n| [[2012 St. Louis Cardinals season|2012]] \n| $591\n| $233\n| $25.0\n| $123\n| 116\n| <ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.forbes.com/teams/st-louis-cardinals/ |work=Forbes |title=#11 St. Louis Cardinals |date=March 21, 2012 |accessdate=March 22, 2012}}</ref> \n|-\n| [[2013 St. Louis Cardinals season|2013]]  \n| $716\n| $239\n| $19.9\n| $134\n| 102\n| <ref name=Forbes2013/>\n|-\n| [[2014 St. Louis Cardinals season|2014]]\n| $820\n| $283\n| $65.2\n| $133\n| 118\n| <ref name=Forbes2014/><ref name=portfolio>{{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/teams/st-louis-cardinals/ |title=St. Louis Cardinals on the Forbes MLB team valuations list |publisher=[[Forbes]] |accessdate=March 30, 2014}}</ref>\n|-\n| [[2015 St. Louis Cardinals season|2015]]\n| $1,400\n| $294\n| $73.6\n| $133\n| 111\n| <ref name=portfolio /><ref name=Forbes15>{{cite web |url=http://forbes.com/teams/st-louis-cardinals |title=St. Louis Cardinals on the Forbes MLB team valuations list |publisher=[[Forbes]] |accessdate=July 10, 2015}}</ref>\n|-\n| [[2016 St. Louis Cardinals season|2016]]\n| $1,600\n| $300\n| $59.8\n| $145\n| 115\n| <ref name=forbes2016 />\n|-\n| [[2017 St. Louis Cardinals season|2017]]\n| $1,800\n| $310\n| $40.5\n| $173\n| &nbsp; 86\n| <ref name=forbes2017>{{cite web |url=https://www.forbes.com/teams/st-louis-cardinals |title=St. Louis Cardinals |work=[[Forbes]] |date=April 11, 2017}}</ref>\n|-\n| [[2018 St. Louis Cardinals season|2018]]\n| $1,900\n| $319\n| $40.0\n| $165\n| &nbsp; 89\n| <ref name=forbes2018 />\n|-\n|}\n\n<!-- Franchise Value, Revenue, Operating Inc., Player Expenses, Wins-to-player cost ratio -->\nAll valuations per ''Forbes.''<br />\n<sup>1</sup> Based on current stadium deal (unless new stadium is pending) without deduction for debt, other than stadium debt. <br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;(2018: market $715 mil., stadium $447 mil., sport $493 mil., brand management $245 mil.)<ref name=forbes2018/> <br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;<small>(2017: market $666 mil., stadium $411 mil., sport $488 mil., brand management $235 mil.)<ref name=forbes2017/> <br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;(2016: market $613 mil., stadium $378 mil., sport $406 mil., brand management $219 mil.)<ref name=forbes2016/> <br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;(2015: market $548 mil., stadium $338 mil., sport $331 mil., brand management $197 mil.) <br />\n&nbsp;&nbsp;(2014: market $339 mil., stadium $211 mil., sport $156 mil., brand management $124 mil.) <br />\n&nbsp; (2013: market $291 mil., stadium $182 mil., sport $151 mil., brand management $91 mil.) <br /> \n&nbsp;(2012: market $240 mil., stadium $157 mil., sport $119 mil., brand management $78 mil.)<br /> \n&nbsp;(2011: market $206 mil., stadium $136 mil., sport $111 mil., brand management $65 mil.)</small>\n\n<sup>2</sup> Net of stadium revenues used for debt payments. <br />\n<sup>3</sup> Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization. <br />\n<sup>4</sup> Includes benefits and bonuses. <br />\n<sup>5</sup> Compares the number of wins per player payroll relative to the rest of MLB.

It is part of the ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' series and follows ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog 2]]'' (1992). After [[Doctor Robotnik]]'s spaceship, the Death Egg, crash-lands on a mysterious floating island, [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic]] and [[Tails (character)|Tails]] attempt to retrieve the [[Chaos Emeralds]] to stop it from relaunching. ''Sonic 3'' introduces [[Knuckles the Echidna]], the island guardian, who lays traps for Sonic and Tails. Gameplay is similar to previous entries, with players traversing [[side-scrolling]] levels at high speeds while collecting [[Rings (Sonic the Hedgehog)|rings]] and defeating enemies.\n\nDevelopment began in January 1993, shortly after the release of ''Sonic 2''. It was initially developed as an [[Isometric video game graphics|isometric]] game similar to ''[[Sonic 3D Blast]]'' (1996), but became a conventional 2D platformer due to time constraints. ''Sonic 3''{{'s}} production took place simultaneously with ''[[Sonic & Knuckles]]''; they were developed as a single game until time constraints and cartridge costs forced the developers to split it. The ''Sonic 3'' cartridge can be attached to an adapter on the ''Sonic & Knuckles'' cartridge, creating a combined game, ''Sonic 3 & Knuckles''. Pop musician [[Michael Jackson]] reportedly composed portions of the soundtrack, but left the project and went uncredited.\n\n''Sonic 3'' was released for the [[Sega Genesis]] in North America and Europe in February 1994, and in Japan the following May. As with its predecessors, it was a critical and commercial success, with critics seeing it as an improvement over previous installments. It sold over one million copies in the United States, making it one of the [[bestselling Genesis games]]. Alongside ''Sonic & Knuckles'', a [[Windows]] port was released through the ''[[Sonic & Knuckles Collection]]'' (1997). The game has also been rereleased via [[Video game emulation|emulation]] and [[product bundling|compilations]] for various platforms, including ''[[Sonic Mega Collection]]'' (2002) and ''[[Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection]]'' (2009).\n\n== Gameplay ==\n[[File:Sonic3 Hydrocity.png|thumb|240px|left|Sonic and Tails exploring the underwater portion of Hydrocity, the second zone]]\n''Sonic the Hedgehog 3'' is a [[2D computer graphics|2D]] [[side-scrolling video game|side-scrolling]] [[platform game|platformer]]. Players can control Sonic, Tails, or both. In the latter choice, players control Sonic while Tails runs along beside him; a second player can join at any time and control Tails separately.<ref name=\"wii.ign.com\" /> ''Sonic 3'' adds the ability for Tails to fly for a short time by spinning his twin tails like helicopter rotor;<ref name=\"wii.ign.com\" /> when he tires, he falls.

Levels are populated with Robotnik's robots, called \"badniks\"; Sonic and Tails can defeat badniks by jumping on them or using the \"spin dash\" attack, which also gives the character a speed boost.<ref name=\"m89\" /> The levels include obstacles and other features such as [[vertical loop]]s, corkscrews, breakable walls, spikes, water that the player can drown in, and bottomless pits.<ref name=\"game\">{{cite video game|title=Sonic the Hedgehog 3|developer=Sonic Team|publisher=Sega|date=February 2, 1994}}</ref> There is a [[miniboss]] fight with one of Robotnik's large, powerful robots at the end of the first act of each level and a full [[boss (video gaming)|boss]] fight with Robotnik at the end of the second.<ref name=\"m45\">''Sonic the Hedgehog 3'' (Genesis) instruction manual, pp. 4\u20135.</ref> Reaching a new level [[Autosave|saves]] the game to one of six save slots.<ref name=\"m10\">''Sonic the Hedgehog 3'' (Genesis) instruction manual, p. 10.</ref>\n\nAs with previous ''Sonic'' games, ''Sonic 3'' uses [[Rings (Sonic the Hedgehog)|rings]], scattered throughout the levels, as a health system; when the player is attacked without rings, is crushed, falls off-screen, drowns, or exceeds the act's ten-minute limit, they lose a [[health (gaming)|life]] and return to the most recently passed [[checkpoint (video gaming)|checkpoint]]. Dying with zero lives gives the player a [[game over]]. The levels also include power-ups in television monitors that, when hit, grant the character an [[1-up|extra life]], temporary invincibility to most hazards, a number of rings,<ref name=\"m1213\">''Sonic the Hedgehog 3'' (Genesis) instruction manual, pp. 12\u201313.</ref> a shield that allows them to breathe underwater, a shield that allows them to withstand fire from enemy projectiles, or a shield that attracts nearby rings.<ref name=\"palgn\" />\n\n{{multiple image\n | align = right\n | direction = vertical\n | alt1 =\n | alt2 =\n | footer_align = left\n | image1 = Sonic 3 Special Stage.png\n | width1 = 240\n | caption1 = Tails in one of the special stages, in which the player can earn [[Chaos Emeralds]]\n | image2 = S3 special stage mechanics.svg\n | width2 = 240\n | caption2 = A diagram of how rings are generated by walking the perimeter of a group of blue spheres\n}}\n\n''Sonic 3'' contains two types of \"special stages\".

Both sides of the corridor are lined with flippers, which disappear when the character bounces on them, and the switch drops when both flippers supporting it are removed.

Passing through a blue sphere turns it red, and touching a red sphere causes the player to leave the stage, unless the player has just completed a cycle around an arrangement of blue spheres, in which case all of these spheres turn to harmless rings. Removing all of the blue spheres gives the player a [[Chaos Emerald]]; if Sonic (not Tails) collects all seven, he can become [[Sonic the Hedgehog (series)#Common features|Super Sonic]] at will, which makes him invincible to most obstacles.<ref name=\"palgn\" /><ref name=\"super\">{{cite web|last1=Khan|first1=Jahanzeb|title=20 Years Ago: Sonic 3 & Knuckles|url=http://www.hardcoregamer.com/2014/04/11/20-years-ago-sonic-knuckles/80530/|publisher=Hardcore Gamer|accessdate=January 4, 2015|date=April 2014}}</ref> Failing to collect the seven Chaos Emeralds triggers a [[post-credits scene]] in which Robotnik and Knuckles taunt the player.<ref>{{cite video game|title=Sonic the Hedgehog 3|developer=Sonic Team|publisher=Sega|platform=Genesis/Mega Drive|scene=Ending sequence|date=1994}}</ref>\n\n''Sonic 3'' includes a competitive mode: two players, controlling Sonic, Tails, or [[Knuckles the Echidna]], race through one or all of five stages that do not appear in the main game.

It holds a score of 89 percent at review aggregator [[GameRankings]] based on five reviews.<ref name=\"gr_s3\"/> Critics generally felt ''Sonic 3'' was the best game in the series so far. Andrew Humphreys of ''[[Hyper (magazine)|Hyper]]'', who declared himself not a ''Sonic'' fan, said it was \"undoubtedly\" the best of the series, including the acclaimed but obscure ''Sonic CD'', though he admitted having preferred ''Sonic 2''{{'s}} special stages by a small margin.<ref name=\"hyper\"/> ''[[Sega Saturn Magazine|Sega Magazine]]'', however, stated that ''Sonic 3'' has better special stages and was not only superior to ''Sonic 2'' as a whole but would be \"a serious contender for the Best Platform Game Ever award\".<ref name=\"sm\"/> ''[[Sega Power]]'' wrote that despite their skepticism, they found it \"excellent\" and easily \"the most explorable and playable\" in the series.<ref name=\"power\"/> ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' also compared ''Sonic 3'' favorably to ''Sonic 1'', ''2'', and ''CD'' and awarded it their \"Game of the Month\" award.<ref name=\"EGM30\"/> They later ranked it number 1 in The EGM Hot 50, indicating that it received the highest average score of any game they had reviewed in the past year.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=The EGM Hot 50 |magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]] |issue=69 |publisher=[[Ziff Davis]] |date=April 1995 |pages=44\u201348}}</ref> Lucas M. Thomas of IGN stated that ''Sonic 3'' \"completed the trilogy as the best of them all\".<ref name=\"wii.ign.com\"/> Dan Whitehead of ''[[Eurogamer]],'' however, considered ''Sonic & Knuckles'' superior.<ref name=\"euro\"/> Lionel Vilner of ''[[:fr:Gen4|G\u00e9n\u00e9ration 4]]'' believed ''Sonic 3'' offered more challenge than its predecessors.<ref name=\"G4Rev\"/> The Unknown Gamer of ''[[GamePro]]'' proclaimed that it \"proves that you can teach an old hedgehog new and exciting tricks. Take that old ''Sonic'' magic, add fun new variations, and you have another spectacular game.\"<ref name=\"GameProGEN\"/>\n\nSome critics felt that ''Sonic 3'' had innovated too little from previous ''Sonic'' games. Humphreys of ''Hyper'' saw only \"a few new features\"<ref name=\"hyper\"/> while ''Sega Power'' thought it was \"not all that different\"<ref name=\"power\"/> and Nintendo Life writer Damien McFerran said that \"there's not a lot of new elements here to be brutally frank\".<ref name=\"nlife\"/> While Deniz Ahmet of ''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' agreed that the game was \"more of the same\", he was placated by the new and imaginative ideas.<ref name=\"CVGRev\"/> Frank Provo of ''[[GameSpot]]'' stated that the most significant addition was its save system.<ref name=\"gspot_s3\"/> However, he and ''Electronic Gaming Monthly'' also both enjoyed the new power-ups.<ref name=\"EGM30\"/><ref name=\"gspot_s3\"/> Many aspects of the level design were praised; ''Electronic Gaming Monthly'' and ''Sega Power'' enjoyed the expansive stages, secret areas, much less linear level design, and difficulty.<ref name=\"EGM30\"/><ref name=\"power\"/> ''[[Mean Machines]]'' agreed, describing the game as \"a rollercoaster ride from start to finish\" and listing Carnival Night as their favorite level, which they described as \"probably the most slickly programmed portion of game in Megadrive history\".<ref name=\"mean\"/> Humphreys and ''Mean Machines'' felt that the game was too short, but they and ''Sega Magazine'' felt that its two-player mode and the Emerald collecting would significantly extend the [[replay value]].<ref name=\"hyper\"/><ref name=\"mean\"/><ref name=\"sm\"/> On the other hand, Whitehead said that the large stages would keep players sufficiently engrossed.<ref name=\"euro\"/> ''Sega Magazine'' also enjoyed having the ability to play as Knuckles in the two-player mode.<ref name=\"sm\"/> The Unknown Gamer felt that while the two-player mode was less fun than the main game, it was much improved over that of its predecessor due to the change of format from split-screen to full-screen.<ref name=\"GameProGEN\"/>\n\nThe visuals were very well received. Humphreys described ''Sonic 3'' as \"one of the most beautiful games around\" and full of \"flashy new visual tricks\", highlighting Sonic's ascension up pipes and spiraling pathways as particularly inventive.<ref name=\"hyper\"/> ''Sega Magazine'' exclaimed that its graphics were \"brilliant\" even for a ''Sonic'' game,<ref name=\"sm\"/> while Provo praised the \"elaborate\" backgrounds.<ref name=\"gspot_s3\"/> ''Mean Machines'' thought similarly, giving special praise to the camera's quick scrolling, the diversity of the level themes, and the \"chunkier, more detailed\" overall aesthetic.<ref name=\"mean\"/> Rik Skews of ''Computer and Video Games'' stated that \"the graphics were stunning, attention to detail is breathtaking\". Ahmet of the same publication also noted that the graphics were more detailed than those of previous installments.<ref name=\"CVGRev\"/> The Unknown Gamer described the settings as having \"gorgeous background detail and lots of visual treats\" and was impressed by the new obstacles that Sonic can traverse at top speeds.<ref name=\"GameProGEN\"/> Thomas and Provo especially enjoyed the use of wordless cutscenes to create a coherent story and thematically connect the zones.<ref name=\"wii.ign.com\"/><ref name=\"gspot_s3\"/> McFerran, however, felt that the visuals had been downgraded, particularly Sonic's \"dumpier\" sprite and \"the infamous 'dotty' textures\".<ref name=\"nlife\"/>\n\nThe sound effects and music were also well received, though somewhat less so than the visuals. ''Sega Magazine'' described them as \"brilliant\" and \"far superior\" to ''Sonic 2''{{'s}}.<ref name=\"sm\"/> ''Mean Machines'' stated that every level had \"great tunes\" and sound effects and particularly praised the ending music.<ref name=\"mean\"/> However, Humphreys described the sound as \"Sonicky ... with the emphasis on the 'icky'\"; he also found it strikingly similar to the first two ''Sonic'' games' soundtracks.<ref name=\"hyper\"/> The Unknown Gamer also saw musical similarity to previous installments, and described the individual tracks as \"catchy... until you've heard it a hundred times.\"<ref name=\"GameProGEN\"/> Thomas thought the music was \"impressive\", but not quite on par with ''Sonic 2''{{'s}}.<ref name=\"wii.ign.com\"/>\n\nReviews of ports have been slightly less positive; the Xbox 360 release has scores of 78% and 79% at GameRankings and [[Metacritic]], respectively.<ref name=\"mc x360\"/> Some critics, such as Adam Ghiggino of [[PALGN]], felt ''Sonic 3'' had been insufficiently upgraded for re-releases;<ref name=\"palgn\"/> Whitehead of ''Eurogamer'' wished online co-op had been implemented.<ref name=\"euro\"/> Provo of GameSpot and Thomas of IGN wished Sega had re-released ''Sonic 3'' and ''Sonic & Knuckles'' together as ''Sonic 3 & Knuckles'' instead.<ref name=\"wii.ign.com\"/><ref name=\"gspot_s3\"/>\n\n''[[Mega (magazine)|Mega]]'' ranked it the fifth best Genesis game ever in November 1994.<ref>{{cite magazine |magazine=Mega |issue=26 |page=74 |publisher=[[Maverick Magazines]] |date=November 1994}}</ref> In 2014, [[GamesRadar]] ranked ''Sonic 3 & Knuckles'' as the seventh best Genesis game;<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gamesradar.com/best-sega-genesis-games-all-time/ |publisher=GamesRadar |title=Best Sega Genesis/Mega Drive games of all time |author=GamesRadar Staff |date=August 14, 2014 |accessdate=January 5, 2015}}</ref> in 2013, Jeremy Parish of ''[[Eurogamer|US Gamer]]'' ranked it eighth.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.usgamer.net/articles/the-best-genesis-and-sega-cd-games |website=[[Eurogamer]] |title=The 10 Best Genesis/Mega Drive and Top 5 Sega CD Games |last=Parish |first=Jeremy |date=October 29, 2013 |accessdate=January 5, 2014}}</ref>\n\n== Legacy ==\n''Sonic 3'' was the first appearance of [[Knuckles the Echidna]], who would be featured prominently in future ''Sonic'' games.

It is part of the ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog]]'' series and follows ''[[Sonic the Hedgehog 2]]'' (1992). After [[Doctor Robotnik]]'s spaceship, the Death Egg, crash-lands on a mysterious floating island, [[Sonic the Hedgehog (character)|Sonic]] and [[Tails (character)|Tails]] attempt to retrieve the [[Chaos Emeralds]] to stop it from relaunching. ''Sonic 3'' introduces [[Knuckles the Echidna]], the island guardian, who lays traps for Sonic and Tails. Gameplay is similar to previous entries, with players traversing [[side-scrolling]] levels at high speeds while collecting [[Rings (Sonic the Hedgehog)|rings]] and defeating enemies.\n\nDevelopment began in January 1993, shortly after the release of ''Sonic 2''. It was initially developed as an [[Isometric video game graphics|isometric]] game similar to ''[[Sonic 3D Blast]]'' (1996), but became a conventional 2D platformer due to time constraints. ''Sonic 3''{{'s}} production took place simultaneously with ''[[Sonic & Knuckles]]''; they were developed as a single game until time constraints and cartridge costs forced the developers to split it. The ''Sonic 3'' cartridge can be attached to an adapter on the ''Sonic & Knuckles'' cartridge, creating a combined game, ''Sonic 3 & Knuckles''. Pop musician [[Michael Jackson]] reportedly composed portions of the soundtrack, but left the project and went uncredited.\n\n''Sonic 3'' was released for the [[Sega Genesis]] in North America and Europe in February 1994, and in Japan the following May. As with its predecessors, it was a critical and commercial success, with critics seeing it as an improvement over previous installments. It sold over one million copies in the United States, making it one of the [[bestselling Genesis games]]. Alongside ''Sonic & Knuckles'', a [[Windows]] port was released with the ''[[Sonic & Knuckles Collection]]'' (1997). The game has also been rereleased via [[Video game emulation|emulation]] and [[product bundling|compilations]] for various platforms, including ''[[Sonic Mega Collection]]'' (2002) and ''[[Sonic's Ultimate Genesis Collection]]'' (2009).\n\n== Gameplay ==\n[[File:Sonic3 Hydrocity.png|thumb|240px|left|Sonic and Tails exploring the underwater portion of Hydrocity, the second zone]]\n''Sonic the Hedgehog 3'' is a [[2D computer graphics|2D]] [[side-scrolling video game|side-scrolling]] [[platform game|platformer]]. Players can control Sonic, Tails, or both. In the latter choice, players control Sonic while Tails runs along beside him; a second player can join at any time and control Tails separately.<ref name=\"wii.ign.com\" /> ''Sonic 3'' adds the ability for Tails to fly for a short time by spinning his twin tails like helicopter rotor;<ref name=\"wii.ign.com\" /> when he tires, he falls. Unlike Sonic, Tails can also swim underwater.<ref name=\"m89\">''Sonic the Hedgehog 3'' (Genesis) instruction manual, pp. 8\u20139.</ref>\n\n''Sonic 3'' takes place over six [[level (video gaming)|zones]],<ref name=\"m1617\">''Sonic the Hedgehog 3'' (Genesis) instruction manual, pp. 16\u201317.</ref> each divided into two acts. Levels are populated with Robotnik's robots, called \"badniks\"; Sonic and Tails can defeat badniks by jumping on them or using the \"spin dash\" attack, which also gives the character a speed boost.<ref name=\"m89\" /> The levels include obstacles and other features such as [[vertical loop]]s, corkscrews, breakable walls, spikes, water that the player can drown in, and bottomless pits.<ref name=\"game\">{{cite video game|title=Sonic the Hedgehog 3|developer=Sonic Team|publisher=Sega|date=February 2, 1994}}</ref> There is a [[miniboss]] fight with one of Robotnik's large, powerful robots at the end of the first act of each level and a full [[boss (video gaming)|boss]] fight with Robotnik at the end of the second.<ref name=\"m45\">''Sonic the Hedgehog 3'' (Genesis) instruction manual, pp. 4\u20135.</ref> Reaching a new level [[Autosave|saves]] the game to one of six save slots.<ref name=\"m10\">''Sonic the Hedgehog 3'' (Genesis) instruction manual, p. 10.</ref>\n\nAs with previous ''Sonic'' games, ''Sonic 3'' uses [[Rings (Sonic the Hedgehog)|rings]], scattered throughout the levels, as a health system; when the player is attacked without rings, is crushed, falls off-screen, drowns, or exceeds the act's ten-minute limit, they lose a [[health (gaming)|life]] and return to the most recently passed [[checkpoint (video gaming)|checkpoint]]. Dying with zero lives gives the player a [[game over]]. The levels also include power-ups in television monitors that, when hit, grant the character an [[1-up|extra life]], temporary invincibility to most hazards, a number of rings,<ref name=\"m1213\">''Sonic the Hedgehog 3'' (Genesis) instruction manual, pp. 12\u201313.</ref> a shield that allows them to breathe underwater, a shield that allows them to withstand fire from enemy projectiles, or a shield that attracts nearby rings.<ref name=\"palgn\" />\n\n{{multiple image\n | align = right\n | direction = vertical\n | alt1 =\n | alt2 =\n | footer_align = left\n | image1 = Sonic 3 Special Stage.png\n | width1 = 240\n | caption1 = Tails in one of the special stages, in which the player can earn [[Chaos Emeralds]]\n | image2 = S3 special stage mechanics.svg\n | width2 = 240\n | caption2 = A diagram of how rings are generated by walking the perimeter of a group of blue spheres\n}}\n\n''Sonic 3'' contains two types of \"special stages\".

Both sides of the corridor are lined with flippers, which disappear when the character bounces on them, and the switch drops when both flippers supporting it are removed. The corridor's floor contains a bounce pad, which also disappears after one use; falling afterwards causes the player to leave the stage with the most recent power-up collected.<ref name=\"m1415\">''Sonic the Hedgehog 3'' (Genesis) instruction manual, pp. 14\u201315.</ref>\n\nThe second type, triggered by entering giant rings found in secret passages, involves running around a [[3D computer graphics|3D]] map and passing through all of a number of blue spheres arranged in patterns. Passing through a blue sphere turns it red, and touching a red sphere causes the player to leave the stage, unless the player has just completed a cycle around an arrangement of blue spheres, in which case all of these spheres turn to harmless rings. Removing all of the blue spheres gives the player a [[Chaos Emerald]]; if Sonic (not Tails) collects all seven, he can become [[Sonic the Hedgehog (series)#Common features|Super Sonic]] at will, which makes him invincible to most obstacles.<ref name=\"palgn\" /><ref name=\"super\">{{cite web|last1=Khan|first1=Jahanzeb|title=20 Years Ago: Sonic 3 & Knuckles|url=http://www.hardcoregamer.com/2014/04/11/20-years-ago-sonic-knuckles/80530/|publisher=Hardcore Gamer|accessdate=January 4, 2015|date=April 2014}}</ref> Failing to collect the seven Chaos Emeralds triggers a [[post-credits scene]] in which Robotnik and Knuckles taunt the player.<ref>{{cite video game|title=Sonic the Hedgehog 3|developer=Sonic Team|publisher=Sega|platform=Genesis/Mega Drive|scene=Ending sequence|date=1994}}</ref>\n\n''Sonic 3'' includes a competitive mode: two players, controlling Sonic, Tails, or [[Knuckles the Echidna]], race through one or all of five stages that do not appear in the main game.

Genesis version of ''Sonic 3'' is one of the [[List of bestselling Sega Genesis video games|bestselling Genesis games]],<ref name=\"magicboxus\">{{cite

Box}}</ref>\n\nLike its predecessors, ''Sonic 3'' received critical acclaim. It holds a score of 89 percent at review aggregator [[GameRankings]] based on five reviews.<ref name=\"gr_s3\"/> Critics generally felt ''Sonic 3'' was the best game in the series so far. Andrew Humphreys of ''[[Hyper (magazine)|Hyper]]'', who declared himself not a ''Sonic'' fan, said it was \"undoubtedly\" the best of the series, including the acclaimed but obscure ''Sonic CD'', though he admitted having preferred ''Sonic 2''{{'s}} special stages by a small margin.<ref name=\"hyper\"/> ''[[Sega Saturn Magazine|Sega Magazine]]'', however, stated that ''Sonic 3'' has better special stages and was not only superior to ''Sonic 2'' as a whole but would be \"a serious contender for the Best Platform Game Ever award\".<ref name=\"sm\"/> ''[[Sega Power]]'' wrote that despite their skepticism, they found it \"excellent\" and easily \"the most explorable and playable\" in the series.<ref name=\"power\"/> ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' also compared ''Sonic 3'' favorably to ''Sonic 1'', ''2'', and ''CD'' and awarded it their \"Game of the Month\" award.<ref name=\"EGM30\"/> They later ranked it number 1 in The EGM Hot 50, indicating that it received the highest average score of any game they had reviewed in the past year.<ref>{{cite magazine |title=The EGM Hot 50 |magazine=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]] |issue=69 |publisher=[[Ziff Davis]] |date=April 1995 |pages=44\u201348}}</ref> Lucas M. Thomas of IGN stated that ''Sonic 3'' \"completed the trilogy as the best of them all\".<ref name=\"wii.ign.com\"/> Dan Whitehead of ''[[Eurogamer]],'' however, considered ''Sonic & Knuckles'' superior.<ref name=\"euro\"/> Lionel Vilner of ''[[:fr:Gen4|G\u00e9n\u00e9ration 4]]'' believed ''Sonic 3'' offered more challenge than its predecessors.<ref name=\"G4Rev\"/> The Unknown Gamer of ''[[GamePro]]'' proclaimed that it \"proves that you can teach an old hedgehog new and exciting tricks. Take that old ''Sonic'' magic, add fun new variations, and you have another spectacular game.\"<ref name=\"GameProGEN\"/>\n\nSome critics felt that ''Sonic 3'' had innovated too little from previous ''Sonic'' games. Humphreys of ''Hyper'' saw only \"a few new features\"<ref name=\"hyper\"/> while ''Sega Power'' thought it was \"not all that different\"<ref name=\"power\"/> and Nintendo Life writer Damien McFerran said that \"there's not a lot of new elements here to be brutally frank\".<ref name=\"nlife\"/> While Deniz Ahmet of ''[[Computer and Video Games]]'' agreed that the game was \"more of the same\", he was placated by the new and imaginative ideas.<ref name=\"CVGRev\"/> Frank Provo of ''[[GameSpot]]'' stated that the most significant addition was its save system.<ref name=\"gspot_s3\"/> However, he and ''Electronic Gaming Monthly'' also both enjoyed the new power-ups.<ref name=\"EGM30\"/><ref name=\"gspot_s3\"/> Many aspects of the level design were praised; ''Electronic Gaming Monthly'' and ''Sega Power'' enjoyed the expansive stages, secret areas, much less linear level design, and difficulty.<ref name=\"EGM30\"/><ref name=\"power\"/> ''[[Mean Machines]]'' agreed, describing the game as \"a rollercoaster ride from start to finish\" and listing Carnival Night as their favorite level, which they described as \"probably the most slickly programmed portion of game in Megadrive history\".<ref name=\"mean\"/> Humphreys and ''Mean Machines'' felt that the game was too short, but they and ''Sega Magazine'' felt that its two-player mode and the Emerald collecting would significantly extend the [[replay value]].<ref name=\"hyper\"/><ref name=\"mean\"/><ref name=\"sm\"/> On the other hand, Whitehead said that the large stages would keep players sufficiently engrossed.<ref name=\"euro\"/> ''Sega Magazine'' also enjoyed having the ability to play as Knuckles in the two-player mode.<ref name=\"sm\"/> The Unknown Gamer felt that while the two-player mode was less fun than the main game, it was much improved over that of its predecessor due to the change of format from split-screen to full-screen.<ref name=\"GameProGEN\"/>\n\nThe visuals were very well received. Humphreys described ''Sonic 3'' as \"one of the most beautiful games around\" and full of \"flashy new visual tricks\", highlighting Sonic's ascension up pipes and spiraling pathways as particularly inventive.<ref name=\"hyper\"/> ''Sega Magazine'' exclaimed that its graphics were \"brilliant\" even for a ''Sonic'' game,<ref name=\"sm\"/> while Provo praised the \"elaborate\" backgrounds.<ref name=\"gspot_s3\"/> ''Mean Machines'' thought similarly, giving special praise to the camera's quick scrolling, the diversity of the level themes, and the \"chunkier, more detailed\" overall aesthetic.<ref name=\"mean\"/> Rik Skews of ''Computer and Video Games'' stated that \"the graphics were stunning, attention to detail is breathtaking\". Ahmet of the same publication also noted that the graphics were more detailed than those of previous installments.<ref name=\"CVGRev\"/> The Unknown Gamer described the settings as having \"gorgeous background detail and lots of visual treats\" and was impressed by the new obstacles that Sonic can traverse at top speeds.<ref name=\"GameProGEN\"/> Thomas and Provo especially enjoyed the use of wordless cutscenes to create a coherent story and thematically connect the zones.<ref name=\"wii.ign.com\"/><ref name=\"gspot_s3\"/> McFerran, however, felt that the visuals had been downgraded, particularly Sonic's \"dumpier\" sprite and \"the infamous 'dotty' textures\".<ref name=\"nlife\"/>\n\nThe sound effects and music were also well received, though somewhat less so than the visuals. ''Sega Magazine'' described them as \"brilliant\" and \"far superior\" to ''Sonic 2''{{'s}}.<ref name=\"sm\"/> ''Mean Machines'' stated that every level had \"great tunes\" and sound effects and particularly praised the ending music.<ref name=\"mean\"/> However, Humphreys described the sound as \"Sonicky ... with the emphasis on the 'icky'\"; he also found it strikingly similar to the first two ''Sonic'' games' soundtracks.<ref name=\"hyper\"/> The Unknown Gamer also saw musical similarity to previous installments, and described the individual tracks as \"catchy... until you've heard it a hundred times.\"<ref name=\"GameProGEN\"/> Thomas thought the music was \"impressive\", but not quite on par with ''Sonic 2''{{'s}}.<ref name=\"wii.ign.com\"/>\n\nReviews of ports have been slightly less positive; the Xbox 360 release has scores of 78% and 79% at GameRankings and [[Metacritic]], respectively.<ref name=\"mc x360\"/> Some critics, such as Adam Ghiggino of [[PALGN]], felt ''Sonic 3'' had been insufficiently upgraded for re-releases;<ref name=\"palgn\"/> Whitehead of ''Eurogamer'' wished online co-op had been implemented.<ref name=\"euro\"/> Provo of GameSpot and Thomas of IGN wished Sega had re-released ''Sonic 3'' and ''Sonic & Knuckles'' together as ''Sonic 3 & Knuckles'' instead.<ref name=\"wii.ign.com\"/><ref name=\"gspot_s3\"/>\n\n''[[Mega (magazine)|Mega]]'' ranked it the fifth best Genesis game ever in November 1994.<ref>{{cite magazine |magazine=Mega |issue=26 |page=74 |publisher=[[Maverick Magazines]] |date=November 1994}}</ref> In 2014, [[GamesRadar]] ranked ''Sonic 3 & Knuckles'' as the seventh best Genesis game;<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gamesradar.com/best-sega-genesis-games-all-time/ |publisher=GamesRadar |title=Best Sega Genesis/Mega Drive games of all time |author=GamesRadar Staff |date=August 14, 2014 |accessdate=January 5, 2015}}</ref> in 2013, Jeremy Parish of ''[[Eurogamer|US Gamer]]'' ranked it eighth.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.usgamer.net/articles/the-best-genesis-and-sega-cd-games |website=[[Eurogamer]] |title=The 10 Best Genesis/Mega Drive and Top 5 Sega CD Games |last=Parish |first=Jeremy |date=October 29, 2013 |accessdate=January 5, 2014}}</ref>\n\n== Legacy ==\n''Sonic 3'' was the first appearance of [[Knuckles the Echidna]], who would be featured prominently in future ''Sonic'' games.
