These orders include setting county policies and procedures, issuing contracts, authorizing expenditures, and managing county resources and departments. Most importantly, the commissioners court sets the annual tax rate and the budget for Dallas County government and the courts. The commissioners also set the tax rate and budget for the Dallas County Hospital District which operates [[Parkland Hospital]].\n\nThe commissioners court has direct control over all county offices and departments not otherwise administered by a county elected official. Those departments include Dallas County Elections, Health and Human Services, Facilities Management, Parks and Open Space Program, I.T. Services, Homeland Security and Emergency Services, among others. Through their budget making powers, the commissioners exercise indirect control over the District Attorney's office, Sheriff, District Clerk, County Clerk and County Treasurer. The commissioners also set the budget for each of the District, County, and Justice courts.\n\nDallas County employs a commissioners court administrator who is responsible for the day-to-day management of the commissioners court and implementing the Dallas County Master Plan and the directives of the commissioners court. The current commissioners court administrator is Darryl Martin who was hired by the commissioners in 2008.\n\n[[File:Dallas County Jail 111 W Commerce Street.jpg|thumb|Dallas County Jail, 111 West Commerce Street]]\nDallas County operates several jail facilities.

Johnson]] successfully ran for a full term as President on the Democratic ticket in 1964. In the 2004 election, Democrats won their first countywide administrative office since 1986 by electing [[Lupe Valdez]] to the office of Dallas County Sheriff. The last Democratic countywide administrator was D. Connally elected County Surveyor prior to the office's abolition. Democrats also won three district court benches in 2004. Two years later in 2006, Democrats swept every contested countywide race including County Judge, District Clerk, County Clerk, District Attorney and County Treasurer as well as every contested judicial seat.\n\nStarting in 1992, Dallas County began voting more Democratic than the state of Texas as a whole, with relatively narrow wins from 1992 to 2004 even as the Republican nominee won Texas easily. This trend culminated in 2008 when [[Barack Obama]] won Dallas County with a substantial margin. Obama's coattails allowed Democrats to win the remaining Republican held judicial seats. In 2012, Obama won Dallas County by virtually the same margin as he had done in 2008. In 2016, [[Hillary Clinton]] increased the Democratic margin of victory even further. She became the first Democrat to win 60% of Dallas County since [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] in 1944, whilst under [[Donald Trump]] the Republicans failed to win 40% of the vote in the county for the first time since 1948.\n{{Hidden begin\n|titlestyle = background:#ccccff;\n|title      = Presidential election results\n}}\n{| align=\"center\" border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"float:right; margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\"\n|+ '''Presidential election results'''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS|title=Dave Leip's Atlas of U.S. Presidential Elections|last=Leip|first=David|website=uselectionatlas.org|access-date=2018-07-21}}</ref>\n|- bgcolor=lightgrey\n!

The building was the headquarters of the [[Texas School Book Depository]] Company until 1970. Assassin [[Lee Harvey Oswald]] shot President [[John F. Kennedy]] from a window located on the sixth floor which today houses the [[Sixth Floor Museum]] dedicated to the late president's memory.\n\nActs of the commissioners court are known as 'court orders'. These orders include setting county policies and procedures, issuing contracts, authorizing expenditures, and managing county resources and departments. Most importantly, the commissioners court sets the annual tax rate and the budget for Dallas County government and the courts. The commissioners also set the tax rate and budget for the Dallas County Hospital District which operates [[Parkland Hospital]].\n\nThe commissioners court has direct control over all county offices and departments not otherwise administered by a county elected official. Those departments include Dallas County Elections, Health and Human Services, Facilities Management, Parks and Open Space Program, I.T. Services, Homeland Security and Emergency Services, among others. Through their budget making powers, the commissioners exercise indirect control over the District Attorney's office, Sheriff, District Clerk, County Clerk and County Treasurer. The commissioners also set the budget for each of the District, County, and Justice courts.\n\nDallas County employs a commissioners court administrator who is responsible for the day-to-day management of the commissioners court and implementing the Dallas County Master Plan and the directives of the commissioners court. The current commissioners court administrator is Darryl Martin who was hired by the commissioners in 2008.\n\n[[File:Dallas County Jail 111 W Commerce Street.jpg|thumb|Dallas County Jail, 111 West Commerce Street]]\nDallas County operates several jail facilities.

Johnson]] successfully ran for a full term as President on the Democratic ticket in 1964. In the 2004 election, Democrats won their first countywide administrative office since 1986 by electing [[Lupe Valdez]] to the office of Dallas County Sheriff. The last Democratic countywide administrator was D. Connally elected County Surveyor prior to the office's abolition. Democrats also won three district court benches in 2004. Two years later in 2006, Democrats swept every contested countywide race including County Judge, District Clerk, County Clerk, District Attorney and County Treasurer as well as every contested judicial seat.\n\nStarting in 1992, Dallas County began voting more Democratic than the state of Texas as a whole, with relatively narrow wins from 1992 to 2004 even as the Republican nominee won Texas easily. This trend culminated in 2008 when [[Barack Obama]] won Dallas County with a substantial margin. Obama's coattails allowed Democrats to win the remaining Republican held judicial seats. In 2012, Obama won Dallas County by virtually the same margin as he had done in 2008. In 2016, [[Hillary Clinton]] increased the Democratic margin of victory even further. She became the first Democrat to win 60% of Dallas County since [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] in 1944, whilst under [[Donald Trump]] the Republicans failed to win 40% of the vote in the county for the first time since 1948.\n{{Hidden begin\n|titlestyle = background:#ccccff;\n|title      = Presidential election results\n}}\n{| align=\"center\" border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"float:right; margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\"\n|+ '''Presidential election results'''<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS|title=Dave Leip's Atlas of U.S. Presidential Elections|last=Leip|first=David|website=uselectionatlas.org|access-date=2018-07-21}}</ref>\n|- bgcolor=lightgrey\n!

He is considered the first of the Buddha's two chief disciples, together with [[Maudgaly\u0101yana ]] (Pali: ''Moggall\u0101na''). \u015a\u0101riputra had a key leadership role in the ministry of the Buddha and is considered in many Buddhist schools to have been important in the development of the Buddhist ''[[Abhidharma]]''. He appears in several [[Mahayana sutras]], and in some sutras, is used as a counterpoint to represent the [[Hinayana]] school of Buddhism.  \n\nBuddhist texts relate that \u015a\u0101riputra and Maudgaly\u0101yana were childhood friends who became spiritual wanderers in their youth. After having searched for spiritual truth for a while, they came into contact with the teachings of the Buddha and ordained as monks under him, after which the Buddha declared the friends his two chief disciples. \u015a\u0101riputra was said to have attained enlightenment as an [[arahant|arhat]] two weeks after ordaining. As chief disciple \u015a\u0101riputra assumed a leadership role in the [[Sangha]], doing tasks like looking after monks, giving them objects of meditation, and clarifying points of doctrine. He was the first disciple the Buddha allowed to ordain other monks. \u015a\u0101riputra died shortly before the Buddha in his hometown and was cremated. According to Buddhist texts, his relics were then enshrined at [[Jetavana]] Monastery. Archaeological findings from the 1800s suggest his relics may have been redistributed across the Indian subcontinent by subsequent kings.  \n\n\u015a\u0101riputra is regarded as an important and wise disciple of the Buddha, particularly in [[Theravada]] Buddhism where he is given a status close to a second Buddha. In [[Buddhist art]], he is often depicted alongside the Buddha, usually to his right. \u015a\u0101riputra was known for his strict adherence to the Buddhist [[Vinaya|monastic rules]], as well as for his wisdom and teaching ability, giving him the title \"General of the Dharma\" (Sanskrit: ''Dharmasenapati''; Pali: ''Dhammasen\u0101pati''). \u015a\u0101riputra is considered the disciple of the Buddha who was foremost in [[Praj\u00f1\u0101 (Buddhism)|wisdom]]. His female counterpart was [[Khema|K\u1e63em\u0101]].{{sfn|Krey|2010|p=19}} \n\n== Background ==\nAccording to [[Buddhist texts]], when a fully enlightened [[Buddha (title)|Buddha]] arrives in the world, he always has a set of chief disciples.{{sfn|Hecker|Nyanaponika Thera|2003|p=31-32}} For the current Buddha, [[Gautama Buddha|Gautama]], his chief male disciples were \u015a\u0101riputra and [[Maudgalyayana|Maudgaly\u0101yana]], while his chief female disciples were [[Khema|K\u1e63em\u0101]] and [[Utpalavar\u1e47\u0101]].{{sfn|Mahathera|1998|p=235}}{{sfn|Hecker|Nyanaponika Thera|2003|p=376-377}} According to the [[Buddhava\u1e43sa]], all Buddhas of the past followed this pattern of selecting two chief male disciples and two chief female disciples.{{sfn|Shaw|2013|p=455}} German Buddhist scholar monk [[Nyanaponika Thera]] states that the reason Buddhas always select two chief disciples is to balance responsibilities according to each disciple's specific skills.{{sfn|Hecker|Nyanaponika Thera|2003|p=67}}\n\nAccording to the [[P\u0101li Canon|Pali Canon]], in the distant past \u015a\u0101riputra was born a wealthy [[Brahmin#In Buddhist and Jaina texts|Brahmin]] named Sarada who gave away his wealth to become an ascetic who developed a large following. At that time, Sarada and his followers were visited by the past Buddha, [[Anomadassi Buddha|Anomadass\u012b,]] and were given a sermon given by Anomadass\u012b Buddha's chief disciples. Upon hearing the sermon from Anomadass\u012b Buddha's first chief disciple, Nisabha, Sarada became inspired and [[Adhi\u1e6d\u1e6dh\u0101na|resolved]] to become the first chief disciple of a future Buddha. He then made this wish in front of Anomadass\u012b Buddha, who declared that his aspiration will come true. Upon hearing the prediction, Sarada went to his close friend Sirivaddhana and asked him to resolve to become the second chief disciple of the same Buddha. Sirivaddhana then made a large offering to Anomadass\u012b Buddha and his following and made the wish as suggested.{{sfn|Hecker|Nyanaponika Thera|2003|p=58-61}} The two friends then spent the rest of their lives and several future lives doing good deeds.{{sfn|Malalasekera|2007|p=542}} According to Buddhist legend, the wish came true in the time of Gautama Buddha with Sarada being reborn as \u015a\u0101riputra and Sirivaddhana being reborn as Maudgaly\u0101yana.{{sfn|Hecker|Nyanaponika Thera|2003|p=58-61}}{{sfn|Malalasekera|2007|p=542}}\n\n== Biography ==\n\n=== Early life ===\nBuddhist texts describe that \u015a\u0101riputra was born with the birth name Upati\u1e63ya ([[Pali]]: ''Upatissa'') to a  wealthy [[Brahmin#In Buddhist and Jaina texts|Brahmin]] family in a village near [[R\u0101jagaha]] in the ancient Indian kingdom of [[Magadha]].{{sfn|Hecker|Nyanaponika Thera|2003|p=521}}{{sfn|Silk|2019|p=410}}{{sfn|Sayadaw|1990}} He is described as having had a \"golden complexion\".{{sfn|Shaw|2013|p=458}}{{sfn|Shaw|2006|p=36}}\n\nTexts from the [[Mulasarvastivada]] tradition state he was named after his father, while the [[Pali]] commentaries of the [[Theravada]] tradition state he was named after his birth village.{{sfn|Silk|2019|p=410}}{{refn|Some Pali texts contradict this however and state his birth village as N\u0101laka,{{sfn|Silk|2019|p=410}} although this may be an alternative name for Upatissa.{{sfn|Hecker|Nyanaponika Thera|2003|p=521}}|group=note}} Upati\u1e63ya had six siblings; three brothers named Upasena, Cunda and Revata, and three sisters named C\u0101la, Upac\u0101l\u0101 and S\u012bsupac\u0101l\u0101.

to.{{sfn|Silk|2019|p=416-417}} The goddess then accuses \u015a\u0101riputra of being attached to the duality of what is proper and improper.{{sfn|Berger|1994|p=350-352}}{{sfn|Silk|2019|p=416-417}} Later in the sutra, \u015a\u0101riputra asks that if the goddess is so spiritually advanced, why doesn't she transform out of her female state, indicative of cultural sexism.{{sfn|Berger|1994|p=350-352}} The goddess responds by using her powers to switch bodies with \u015a\u0101riputra to demonstrate that male and female is just an illusion because, according to Mahayana doctrine, all things are empty and so male and female don't really exist.{{sfn|Berger|1994|p=350-352}}{{sfn|Silk|2019|p=416-417}}\n\nIn the ''Astasahasrika Prajnaparamita Sutra'', \u015a\u0101riputra is portrayed as being unable to understand the ultimate meaning of ''[[prajnaparamita]]'' and instead must be instructed by the disciple [[Subh\u016bti]].{{sfn|Silk|2019|p=416-417}} According to Buddhist scholar [[Edward Conze]], the sutra depicts \u015a\u0101riputra as being preoccupied with dualities, making him unable to grasp the true meaning of ''prajnaparamita''.{{sfn|Conze|1983|p=5}} In the ''[[Mahaprajnaparamita Sutra]]'', \u015a\u0101riputra is one of the principal interlocutors, asking questions and being instructed.{{sfn|Conze|1975|p=17,25,28,29}} Conze states that \u015a\u0101riputra has to be instructed in this sutra because, despite his great wisdom, ''prajnaparamita'' doctrine was too advanced for his comprehension.{{sfn|Conze|1975|p=56}} The ''[[Da zhidu lun]]'' commentary to the sutra describes \u015a\u0101riputra as someone who pursued the [[bodhisattva]] path in a past life but gave up and turned to the ''[[\u015ar\u0101vaka]]'' path after donating his eye to a beggar who threw the eye on the ground.{{sfn|Silk|2019|p=416-417}}[[File:Lotus Sutra (Chokokan).jpg|thumb|Japanese depiction of the Lotus Sutra, where \u015a\u0101riputra prompts the Buddha to preach.|alt=|left]]\u015a\u0101riputra plays a major role in the [[Heart Sutra]], where the teaching is directed at him. \u015a\u0101riputra prompts the teaching of the sutra by asking the Mahayana bodhisattva [[Avalokite\u015bvara]] how to practice [[Prajnaparamita|wisdom]].{{sfn|Lopez|1988|p=52}} Avalokite\u015bvara's response to \u015a\u0101riputra, then makes up the body of the sutra.{{sfn|Lopez|1988|p=49}} When Avalokite\u015bvara finishes the sutra the Buddha shows approval of the teaching, and \u015a\u0101riputra, Avalokite\u015bvara, and the audience then rejoice.{{sfn|Lopez|1988|p=121}} In the [[Saddharmapundarika|Lotus Sutra]], the Buddha starts talking about the higher wisdom of [[buddhas]] and his use of skillful means (Sanskrit: [[Up\u0101ya|''up\u0101ya'']]) to teach the Dharma, which leaves the arhats in the assembly confused.{{sfn|Lopez|2016|p=12-13}} \u015a\u0101riputra then asks the Buddha to explain his teachings for the benefit of other beings, prompting the Buddha to teach the ''Lotus Sutra''.{{sfn|Hanh|2008|p=38}}  Later in the sutra, the Buddha explains that \u015a\u0101riputra had followed the [[bodhisattva]] path in past lives but had forgotten and followed the ''\u015ar\u0101vaka'' path in this life.{{sfn|Hanh|2008|p=46}} The Buddha then assures \u015a\u0101riputra that he will also achieve buddhahood and declares that \u015a\u0101riputra will become the future Buddha Padmaprabha.{{sfn|Silk|2019|p=416-417}}{{sfn|Hanh|2008|p=47}} In the listing of the great arhats in the assembly at the beginning of the [[Longer Sukh\u0101vat\u012bvy\u016bha S\u016btra]], \u015a\u0101riputra is mentioned as the fifteenth of the great arhats, while in

(33709016166).jpg|thumb|One of the [[Sanchi]] stupas, where relics of \u015a\u0101riputra were excavated.]]\nAccording to accounts from 7th century Chinese pilgrim [[Xuanzang]], \u015a\u0101riputra's as well as Maudgaly\u0101yana's relics could be found in the Indian city of [[Mathura]] in stupas built by King [[Asoka]].{{sfn|Higham|2004|p=215}} However, as of 1999, no archaeological reports have confirmed such findings at the sites mentioned by either Chinese pilgrims or Buddhist texts.{{sfn|Daulton|1999|p=104-105}} In 1851, archaeologist [[Alexander Cunningham]] and Lieutenant Fred. C. Maisey discovered a pair of sandstone boxes with encased bone fragments inside during an excavation of one of the [[Sanchi Stupa|stupas]] in the city of [[Sanchi Town|Sanchi]], with \u015a\u0101riputra's and Maudgaly\u0101yana's names inscribed on them.{{sfn|Daulton|1999|p=106-107}} \u015a\u0101riputra's casket contained pieces of [[sandalwood]], which Cunningham believed was part of \u015a\u0101riputra's [[funeral pyre]].{{sfn|Brekke|2007|p=274}} Another excavation by Cunningham and Maisey at st\u016bpas in the nearby town of [[Satdh\u0101ra]] found another pair of caskets with encased bone fragments with the two chief disciples' names inscribed.{{sfn|Daulton|1999|p=106-107}} Cunningham concluded that the relics were enshrined in stupas near Rajagaha after the disciples' deaths until the time of King Asoka, who then redistributed them in stupas throughout India.{{sfn|Brekke|2007|p=275}} Scholars have also theorized that a [[Shunga Empire|Sunga]] king may have redistributed the relics of the Buddha and his leading disciples and built stupas such as the one in Sanchi to enshrine them.{{sfn|Daulton|1999|p=105-106}}\n\nCunningham and Maisey later divided their findings among each other, with Maisey bringing the Satdh\u0101ra relics to Britain and eventually loaning them to the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] in London in 1866.{{sfn|Daulton|1999|p=108}}{{sfn|Brekke|2007|p=277}} The relics were eventually purchased by the Museum in 1921 from Maisley's son.{{sfn|Daulton|1999|p=108}} Cunningham brought his findings to Britain on two ships, one of which sank, thus the Sanchi relics are believed to have been lost.{{sfn|Daulton|1999|p=108}}{{sfn|Brekke|2007|p=277-278}} However, historian Torkel Brekke argues that Maisey took all the relics with him, and thus the Sanchi relics went to Britian along with the Satdh\u0101ra ones.{{sfn|Brekke|2007|p=277}} In the early 20th century, Buddhist organizations in India and Burma began pressuring the British government to return the relics to India, where they can be properly venerated. The British government conceded and transferred the relics to predominantly Buddhist [[Sri Lanka]] in 1947 in accordance with an agreement made with Buddhist organizations. In 1949, the relics were sent to India where they were put on tour around northern India before being enshrined in Sanchi in 1952.{{sfn|Daulton|1999|p=110-111}} In 1950, the relics were sent on tour to Burma, with Burmese Prime Minister [[U Nu]] later asking India for a portion of the relics. Indian Prime Minister [[Nehru]] agreed to make a \"permanent loan\" of a portion of the relics to Burma where they were enshrined in the [[Kaba Aye Pagoda]] in 1952.{{sfn|Daulton|1999|p=111-121}} Sri Lanka also obtained a portion of the relics, which were brought from Sanchi in 1952 and kept at the [[Maha Bodhi Society]] in Sri Lanka.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://catholicphilly.com/2015/01/news/world-news/buddhist-center-breaks-tradition-shows-pope-revered-relic/|title=Buddhist center breaks tradition, shows pope revered relic|last=Akkara|first=Anto|date=|website=Catholic Philly|language=en-US|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref>\n\n== Legacy ==\n[[File:BACC - Bangkok - 2017-11-02 (008).jpg|thumb|Image of the Buddha with his chief disciples at [[Bangkok Art and Culture Centre]]. \u015a\u0101riputra is traditionally depicted on the right side of the Buddha while Maudgaly\u0101yana is traditionally depicted on the left.{{sfn|Silk|2019|p=410}} |alt=]]\nAs the chief disciple of the Buddha, \u015a\u0101riputra is considered to be a particularly important figure in Buddhism, especially in the [[Theravada]] tradition. According to Buddhist academic [[Reginald Ray]], \u015a\u0101riputra was the greatest [[arhat]] in the [[P\u0101li Canon|Pali Canon]] and is ranked in the canon as being close to a second Buddha.{{sfn|Ray|1994|p=131-133}} In one text, he is referred to as \"King of the Dharma\" (Sanskrit: ''Dharmaraja'') a title generally reserved for the Buddha, and is described in several texts as one who \"spins the wheel of the Dharma\", a prerogative generally associated with Buddhas.{{sfn|Migot|1954|p=412, 500-501}} In the Pali Canon, \u015a\u0101riputra is credited as the main expounder of several [[suttas]], due to the Buddha trusting in his profound teaching ability.{{sfn|Wayman|1997|p=212}} Indologist [[Alex Wayman]] describes \u015a\u0101riputra as being exemplary of the four [[Brahmavihara|brahma-vih\u0101r\u0101s]], and credits these virtues with why the Buddha entrusted him with leadership of the Sangha.{{sfn|Wayman|1997|p=212}}\n\nIn [[Buddhist art]], he is often depicted alongside the Buddha and Maudgaly\u0101yana, with \u015a\u0101riputra usually depicted on the Buddha's right hand side and Maudgaly\u0101yana usually depicted on the Buddha's left hand side.{{sfn|Silk|2019|p=410}} According to Nyanaponika Thera, this imagery symbolizes the relative positions they held in life, with \u015a\u0101riputra being the Buddha's right hand monk.{{sfn|Hecker|Nyanaponika Thera|2003|p=47}} In Burma, \u015a\u0101riputra is believed to grant wisdom to worshippers, and is one of eight arhats commonly shown devotion to in protective rituals.{{sfn|Buswell|2004|p=750}}\n\n\u015a\u0101riputra is notable for being representative of scholarship and settled monasticism, rather than the forest Buddhism that most of the Buddha's [[Ten Principal Disciples|principal disciples]] are associated with.{{sfn|Ray|1994|p=131-133}} Migot, however, identifies texts that exclude \u015a\u0101riputra's scholastic character as the earliest sources, Migot goes on to argue that the historic \u015a\u0101riputra was different than the person preserved in the Pali Canon.{{sfn|Ray|1994|p=131-133}}{{sfn|Findly|2003|p=398}} According to Ray it is possible \u015a\u0101riputra's scholastic character was the result of texts that were added later, but states there is insufficient evidence to conclude to this.{{sfn|Ray|1994|p=134-136}}\n==See also==\n* [[Maudgalyayana|Moggall\u0101na]]\n*[[Khema]]\n*[[Pa\u00f1\u00f1\u0101]]\n* ''[[Sammaditthi Sutta]]'' \u2013 a Pali Canon discourse attributed to S\u0101riputta\n* [[Sariputra in the Jatakas]]\n* [[Sanchi]]\n* [[Bhadda Kundalakesa]], a former Jain ascetic converted to Buddhism by S\u0101riputta\n\n== Notes ==\n<references group=\"note\" responsive=\"1\"></references>\n\n== Citations ==\n{{reflist|20em}}\n\n== References ==\n{{refbegin |30em}}\n* {{Citation|last=Brekke|first=Torkel|date=2007-01-01|title=Bones of Contention: Buddhist Relics, Nationalism and the Politics of Archaeology|url=https://brill.com/view/journals/nu/54/3/article-p270_2.xml|journal=Numen|language=en|volume=54|issue=3|pages=270\u2013303|doi=10.1163/156852707X211564|issn=1568-5276}}\n* {{Citation|last1=Berger |first1=Patricia Ann |title=Latter Days of the Law: Images of Chinese Buddhism, 850 - 1850 ; [exhibition, August 27 - October 9 1994 ...] |date=1994 |publisher=University of Hawaii Press |isbn=978-0-8248-1662-9 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y6ffYIPn--wC&newbks=1&newbks_redir=0&source=gbs_navlinks_s |language=en}}\n* {{Citation|last1=Bodhi |first1=Bhikkhu |last2=Dhamma |first2=Rewata |title=A comprehensive manual of Abhidhamma : the Abhidhammattha sangaha of \u0100cariya Anuruddha |date=1993 |publisher=BPS Pariyatti Edition |isbn=978-1-928706-02-1 |edition=1st BPS Pariyatti}}\n* {{Citation|last1=Buswell|first1=Robert E.

He is considered the first of the Buddha's two chief disciples, together with [[Maudgaly\u0101yana ]] (Pali: ''Moggall\u0101na''). \u015a\u0101riputra had a key leadership role in the ministry of the Buddha and is considered in many Buddhist schools to have been important in the development of the Buddhist ''[[Abhidharma]]''. He appears in several [[Mahayana sutras]], and in some sutras, is used as a counterpoint to represent the [[Hinayana]] school of Buddhism.  \n\nBuddhist texts relate that \u015a\u0101riputra and Maudgaly\u0101yana were childhood friends who became spiritual wanderers in their youth. After having searched for spiritual truth for a while, they came into contact with the teachings of the Buddha and ordained as monks under him, after which the Buddha declared the friends his two chief disciples. \u015a\u0101riputra was said to have attained enlightenment as an [[arahant|arhat]] two weeks after ordaining. As chief disciple \u015a\u0101riputra assumed a leadership role in the [[Sangha]], doing tasks like looking after monks, giving them objects of meditation, and clarifying points of doctrine. He was the first disciple the Buddha allowed to ordain other monks. \u015a\u0101riputra died shortly before the Buddha in his hometown and was cremated. According to Buddhist texts, his relics were then enshrined at [[Jetavana]] Monastery. Archaeological findings from the 1800s suggest his relics may have been redistributed across the Indian subcontinent by subsequent kings.  \n\n\u015a\u0101riputra is regarded as an important and wise disciple of the Buddha, particularly in [[Theravada]] Buddhism where he is given a status close to a second Buddha. In [[Buddhist art]], he is often depicted alongside the Buddha, usually to his right. \u015a\u0101riputra was known for his strict adherence to the Buddhist [[Vinaya|monastic rules]], as well as for his wisdom and teaching ability, giving him the title \"General of the Dharma\" (Sanskrit: ''Dharmasenapati''; Pali: ''Dhammasen\u0101pati''). \u015a\u0101riputra is considered the disciple of the Buddha who was foremost in [[Praj\u00f1\u0101 (Buddhism)|wisdom]].

At that time, Sarada and his followers were visited by the past Buddha, [[Anomadassi Buddha|Anomadass\u012b,]] and were given a sermon given by Anomadass\u012b Buddha's chief disciples. Upon hearing the sermon from Anomadass\u012b Buddha's first chief disciple, Nisabha, Sarada became inspired and [[Adhi\u1e6d\u1e6dh\u0101na|resolved]] to become the first chief disciple of a future Buddha. He then made this wish in front of Anomadass\u012b Buddha, who declared that his aspiration will come true. Upon hearing the prediction, Sarada went to his close friend Sirivaddhana and asked him to resolve to become the second chief disciple of the same Buddha. Sirivaddhana then made a large offering to Anomadass\u012b Buddha and his following and made the wish as suggested.{{sfn|Hecker|Nyanaponika Thera|2003|p=58-61}} The two friends then spent the rest of their lives and several future lives doing good deeds.{{sfn|Malalasekera|2007|p=542}} According to Buddhist legend, the wish came true in the time of Gautama Buddha with Sarada being reborn as \u015a\u0101riputra and Sirivaddhana being reborn as Maudgaly\u0101yana.{{sfn|Hecker|Nyanaponika Thera|2003|p=58-61}}{{sfn|Malalasekera|2007|p=542}}\n\n== Biography ==\n\n=== Early life ===\nBuddhist texts describe that \u015a\u0101riputra was born with the birth name Upati\u1e63ya ([[Pali]]: ''Upatissa'') to a  wealthy [[Brahmin#In Buddhist and Jaina texts|Brahmin]] family in a village near [[R\u0101jagaha]] in the ancient Indian kingdom of [[Magadha]].{{sfn|Hecker|Nyanaponika Thera|2003|p=521}}{{sfn|Silk|2019|p=410}}{{sfn|Sayadaw|1990}} He is described as having had a \"golden complexion\".{{sfn|Shaw|2013|p=458}}{{sfn|Shaw|2006|p=36}}\n\nTexts from the [[Mulasarvastivada]] tradition state he was named after his father, while the [[Pali]] commentaries of the [[Theravada]] tradition state he was named after his birth village.{{sfn|Silk|2019|p=410}}{{refn|Some Pali texts contradict this however and state his birth village as N\u0101laka,{{sfn|Silk|2019|p=410}} although this may be an alternative name for Upatissa.{{sfn|Hecker|Nyanaponika Thera|2003|p=521}}|group=note}} Upati\u1e63ya had six siblings; three brothers named Upasena, Cunda and Revata, and three sisters named C\u0101la, Upac\u0101l\u0101 and S\u012bsupac\u0101l\u0101.

to.{{sfn|Silk|2019|p=416-417}} The goddess then accuses \u015a\u0101riputra of being attached to the duality of what is proper and improper.{{sfn|Berger|1994|p=350-352}}{{sfn|Silk|2019|p=416-417}} Later in the sutra, \u015a\u0101riputra asks that if the goddess is so spiritually advanced, why doesn't she transform out of her female state, indicative of cultural sexism.{{sfn|Berger|1994|p=350-352}} The goddess responds by using her powers to switch bodies with \u015a\u0101riputra to demonstrate that male and female is just an illusion because, according to Mahayana doctrine, all things are empty and so male and female don't really exist.{{sfn|Berger|1994|p=350-352}}{{sfn|Silk|2019|p=416-417}}\n\nIn the ''Astasahasrika Prajnaparamita Sutra'', \u015a\u0101riputra is portrayed as being unable to understand the ultimate meaning of ''[[prajnaparamita]]'' and instead must be instructed by the disciple [[Subh\u016bti]].{{sfn|Silk|2019|p=416-417}} According to Buddhist scholar [[Edward Conze]], the sutra depicts \u015a\u0101riputra as being preoccupied with dualities, making him unable to grasp the true meaning of ''prajnaparamita''.{{sfn|Conze|1983|p=5}} In the ''[[Mahaprajnaparamita Sutra]]'', \u015a\u0101riputra is one of the principal interlocutors, asking questions and being instructed.{{sfn|Conze|1975|p=17,25,28,29}} Conze states that \u015a\u0101riputra has to be instructed in this sutra because, despite his great wisdom, ''prajnaparamita'' doctrine was too advanced for his comprehension.{{sfn|Conze|1975|p=56}} The ''[[Da zhidu lun]]'' commentary to the sutra describes \u015a\u0101riputra as someone who pursued the [[bodhisattva]] path in a past life but gave up and turned to the ''[[\u015ar\u0101vaka]]'' path after donating his eye to a beggar who threw the eye on the ground.{{sfn|Silk|2019|p=416-417}}[[File:Lotus Sutra (Chokokan).jpg|thumb|Japanese depiction of the Lotus Sutra, where \u015a\u0101riputra prompts the Buddha to preach.|alt=|left]]\u015a\u0101riputra plays a major role in the [[Heart Sutra]], where the teaching is directed at him. \u015a\u0101riputra prompts the teaching of the sutra by asking the Mahayana bodhisattva [[Avalokite\u015bvara]] how to practice [[Prajnaparamita|wisdom]].{{sfn|Lopez|1988|p=52}} Avalokite\u015bvara's response to \u015a\u0101riputra, then makes up the body of the sutra.{{sfn|Lopez|1988|p=49}} When Avalokite\u015bvara finishes the sutra the Buddha shows approval of the teaching, and \u015a\u0101riputra, Avalokite\u015bvara, and the audience then rejoice.{{sfn|Lopez|1988|p=121}} In the [[Saddharmapundarika|Lotus Sutra]], the Buddha starts talking about the higher wisdom of [[buddhas]] and his use of skillful means (Sanskrit: [[Up\u0101ya|''up\u0101ya'']]) to teach the Dharma, which leaves the arhats in the assembly confused.{{sfn|Lopez|2016|p=12-13}} \u015a\u0101riputra then asks the Buddha to explain his teachings for the benefit of other beings, prompting the Buddha to teach the ''Lotus Sutra''.{{sfn|Hanh|2008|p=38}}  Later in the sutra, the Buddha explains that \u015a\u0101riputra had followed the [[bodhisattva]] path in past lives but had forgotten and followed the ''\u015ar\u0101vaka'' path in this life.{{sfn|Hanh|2008|p=46}} The Buddha then assures \u015a\u0101riputra that he will also achieve buddhahood and declares that \u015a\u0101riputra will become the future Buddha Padmaprabha.{{sfn|Silk|2019|p=416-417}}{{sfn|Hanh|2008|p=47}} In the listing of the great arhats in the assembly at the beginning of the [[Longer Sukh\u0101vat\u012bvy\u016bha S\u016btra]], \u015a\u0101riputra is mentioned as the fifteenth of the great arhats, while in

(33709016166).jpg|thumb|One of the [[Sanchi]] stupas, where relics of \u015a\u0101riputra were excavated.]]\nAccording to accounts from 7th century Chinese pilgrim [[Xuanzang]], \u015a\u0101riputra's as well as Maudgaly\u0101yana's relics could be found in the Indian city of [[Mathura]] in stupas built by King [[Asoka]].{{sfn|Higham|2004|p=215}} However, as of 1999, no archaeological reports have confirmed such findings at the sites mentioned by either Chinese pilgrims or Buddhist texts.{{sfn|Daulton|1999|p=104-105}} In 1851, archaeologist [[Alexander Cunningham]] and Lieutenant Fred. C. Maisey discovered a pair of sandstone boxes with encased bone fragments inside during an excavation of one of the [[Sanchi Stupa|stupas]] in the city of [[Sanchi Town|Sanchi]], with \u015a\u0101riputra's and Maudgaly\u0101yana's names inscribed on them.{{sfn|Daulton|1999|p=106-107}} \u015a\u0101riputra's casket contained pieces of [[sandalwood]], which Cunningham believed was part of \u015a\u0101riputra's [[funeral pyre]].{{sfn|Brekke|2007|p=274}} Another excavation by Cunningham and Maisey at st\u016bpas in the nearby town of [[Satdh\u0101ra]] found another pair of caskets with encased bone fragments with the two chief disciples' names inscribed.{{sfn|Daulton|1999|p=106-107}} Cunningham concluded that the relics were enshrined in stupas near Rajagaha after the disciples' deaths until the time of King Asoka, who then redistributed them in stupas throughout India.{{sfn|Brekke|2007|p=275}} Scholars have also theorized that a [[Shunga Empire|Sunga]] king may have redistributed the relics of the Buddha and his leading disciples and built stupas such as the one in Sanchi to enshrine them.{{sfn|Daulton|1999|p=105-106}}\n\nCunningham and Maisey later divided their findings among each other, with Maisey bringing the Satdh\u0101ra relics to Britain and eventually loaning them to the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] in London in 1866.{{sfn|Daulton|1999|p=108}}{{sfn|Brekke|2007|p=277}} The relics were eventually purchased by the Museum in 1921 from Maisley's son.{{sfn|Daulton|1999|p=108}} Cunningham brought his findings to Britain on two ships, one of which sank, thus the Sanchi relics are believed to have been lost.{{sfn|Daulton|1999|p=108}}{{sfn|Brekke|2007|p=277-278}} However, historian Torkel Brekke argues that Maisey took all the relics with him, and thus the Sanchi relics went to Britian along with the Satdh\u0101ra ones.{{sfn|Brekke|2007|p=277}} In the early 20th century, Buddhist organizations in India and Burma began pressuring the British government to return the relics to India, where they can be properly venerated. The British government conceded and transferred the relics to predominantly Buddhist [[Sri Lanka]] in 1947 in accordance with an agreement made with Buddhist organizations. In 1949, the relics were sent to India where they were put on tour around northern India before being enshrined in Sanchi in 1952.{{sfn|Daulton|1999|p=110-111}} In 1950, the relics were sent on tour to Burma, with Burmese Prime Minister [[U Nu]] later asking India for a portion of the relics. Indian Prime Minister [[Nehru]] agreed to make a \"permanent loan\" of a portion of the relics to Burma where they were enshrined in the [[Kaba Aye Pagoda]] in 1952.{{sfn|Daulton|1999|p=111-121}} Sri Lanka also obtained a portion of the relics, which were brought from Sanchi in 1952 and kept at the [[Maha Bodhi Society]] in Sri Lanka.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://catholicphilly.com/2015/01/news/world-news/buddhist-center-breaks-tradition-shows-pope-revered-relic/|title=Buddhist center breaks tradition, shows pope revered relic|last=Akkara|first=Anto|date=|website=Catholic Philly|language=en-US|url-status=live|archive-url=|archive-date=|access-date=2020-03-29}}</ref>\n\n== Legacy ==\n[[File:BACC - Bangkok - 2017-11-02 (008).jpg|thumb|Image of the Buddha with his chief disciples at [[Bangkok Art and Culture Centre]]. \u015a\u0101riputra is traditionally depicted on the right side of the Buddha while Maudgaly\u0101yana is traditionally depicted on the left.{{sfn|Silk|2019|p=410}} |alt=]]\nAs the chief disciple of the Buddha, \u015a\u0101riputra is considered to be a particularly important figure in Buddhism, especially in the [[Theravada]] tradition. According to Buddhist academic [[Reginald Ray]], \u015a\u0101riputra was the greatest [[arhat]] in the [[P\u0101li Canon|Pali Canon]] and is ranked in the canon as being close to a second Buddha.{{sfn|Ray|1994|p=131-133}} In one text, he is referred to as \"King of the Dharma\" (Sanskrit: ''Dharmaraja'') a title generally reserved for the Buddha, and is described in several texts as one who \"spins the wheel of the Dharma\", a prerogative generally associated with Buddhas.{{sfn|Migot|1954|p=412, 500-501}} In the Pali Canon, \u015a\u0101riputra is credited as the main expounder of several [[suttas]], due to the Buddha trusting in his profound teaching ability.{{sfn|Wayman|1997|p=212}} Indologist [[Alex Wayman]] describes \u015a\u0101riputra as being exemplary of the four [[Brahmavihara|brahma-vih\u0101r\u0101s]], and credits these virtues with why the Buddha entrusted him with leadership of the Sangha.{{sfn|Wayman|1997|p=212}}\n\nIn [[Buddhist art]], he is often depicted alongside the Buddha and Maudgaly\u0101yana, with \u015a\u0101riputra usually depicted on the Buddha's right hand side and Maudgaly\u0101yana usually depicted on the Buddha's left hand side.{{sfn|Silk|2019|p=410}} According to Nyanaponika Thera, this imagery symbolizes the relative positions they held in life, with \u015a\u0101riputra being the Buddha's right hand monk.{{sfn|Hecker|Nyanaponika Thera|2003|p=47}} In Burma, \u015a\u0101riputra is believed to grant wisdom to worshippers, and is one of eight arhats commonly shown devotion to in protective rituals.{{sfn|Buswell|2004|p=750}}\n\n\u015a\u0101riputra is notable for being representative of scholarship and settled monasticism, rather than the forest Buddhism that most of the Buddha's [[Ten Principal Disciples|principal disciples]] are associated with.{{sfn|Ray|1994|p=131-133}} Migot, however, identifies texts that exclude \u015a\u0101riputra's scholastic character as the earliest sources, Migot goes on to argue that the historic \u015a\u0101riputra was different than the person preserved in the Pali Canon.{{sfn|Ray|1994|p=131-133}}{{sfn|Findly|2003|p=398}} According to Ray it is possible \u015a\u0101riputra's scholastic character was the result of texts that were added later, but states there is insufficient evidence to conclude to this.{{sfn|Ray|1994|p=134-136}}\n==See also==\n* [[Maudgalyayana|Moggall\u0101na]]\n*[[Khema]]\n*[[Pa\u00f1\u00f1\u0101]]\n* ''[[Sammaditthi Sutta]]'' \u2013 a Pali Canon discourse attributed to S\u0101riputta\n* [[Sariputra in the Jatakas]]\n* [[Sanchi]]\n* [[Bhadda Kundalakesa]], a former Jain ascetic converted to Buddhism by S\u0101riputta\n\n== Notes ==\n<references group=\"note\" responsive=\"1\"></references>\n\n== Citations ==\n{{reflist|20em}}\n\n== References ==\n{{refbegin |30em}}\n* {{Citation|last=Brekke|first=Torkel|date=2007-01-01|title=Bones of Contention: Buddhist Relics, Nationalism and the Politics of Archaeology|url=https://brill.com/view/journals/nu/54/3/article-p270_2.xml|journal=Numen|language=en|volume=54|issue=3|pages=270\u2013303|doi=10.1163/156852707X211564|issn=1568-5276}}\n* {{Citation|last1=Berger |first1=Patricia Ann |title=Latter Days of the Law: Images of Chinese Buddhism, 850 - 1850 ; [exhibition, August 27 - October 9 1994 ...] |date=1994 |publisher=University of Hawaii Press |isbn=978-0-8248-1662-9 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y6ffYIPn--wC&newbks=1&newbks_redir=0&source=gbs_navlinks_s |language=en}}\n* {{Citation|last1=Bodhi |first1=Bhikkhu |last2=Dhamma |first2=Rewata |title=A comprehensive manual of Abhidhamma : the Abhidhammattha sangaha of \u0100cariya Anuruddha |date=1993 |publisher=BPS Pariyatti Edition |isbn=978-1-928706-02-1 |edition=1st BPS Pariyatti}}\n* {{Citation|last1=Buswell|first1=Robert E.

Sasnett]], and the school opened its doors in 1859 to a student body of eighty and a faculty of ten.\n\nAuburn's early history is inextricably linked with the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] and the [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]]-era [[Southern United States#Reconstruction and Jim Crow|South]]. Classes were held in \"Old Main\" until the college was closed due to the war, when most of the students and faculty left to enlist. The campus was a training ground for the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] Army, and \"Old Main\" served as a hospital for Confederate wounded.\n\nTo commemorate Auburn's contribution to the Civil War, a cannon lathe used for the manufacture of cannons for the Confederate Army and recovered from [[Selma, Alabama]], was presented to the college in 1952 by brothers of Delta Chapter of the [[Alpha Phi Omega]] fraternity.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/codelemur/5108012123/in/set-72157625100858387|title= The Cannon Lathe plaque|access-date= January 17, 2011}}</ref> It sits today on the lawn next to [[Samford Hall]].\n\n===Post-Civil War===\nThe school reopened in 1866 after the end of the Civil War, its only closure. In 1872, control of the institution was transferred from the Methodist Church to the State of [[Alabama]] for financial reasons. Alabama placed the school under the provisions of the [[Morrill Act]] as a [[Land-grant colleges|land-grant institution]], the first in the South to be established separately from the state university.{{clarify|What does this sentence's last passage mean?|date=March 2017}} This act provided for 240,000 acres (971&nbsp;km{{sup|2}}) of Federal land to be sold to provide funds for an agricultural and mechanical school. As a result, in 1872 the school was renamed the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Alabama.\n\nUnder the act's provisions, land-grant institutions were also supposed to teach military tactics and train officers for the United States military. In the late 19th century, most students at the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Alabama were enrolled in the cadet program, learning military tactics and training to become officers. Each county in the state was allowed to nominate two cadets to attend the college free of charge.\n\n[[File:1890s Samford Hall Auburn Alabama.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Samford Hall]] in the 1890s]]\nThe university's original curriculum focused on engineering and agriculture. This trend changed under the guidance of [[William Leroy Broun]], who taught classics and sciences and believed both disciplines were important for the growth of the university and the individual. In 1892, two historic events occurred: women were admitted to the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Alabama, and football was played as a school sport. Eventually, football replaced polo as the main sport on campus. The college was renamed the Alabama Polytechnic Institute (API) in 1899, largely because of Broun's influence.<ref name=\"Auburn history\"/>\n\n[[File:Auburn cadets.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.15|API [[Cadet]]s drill on Ross Square in 1918]]\nOn October 1, 1918, nearly all of Alabama Polytechnic Institute's able-bodied male students 18 or older voluntarily joined the [[United States Army]] for short-lived military careers on campus. The student-soldiers numbered 878, according to API president Charles Thach, and formed the academic section of the Student Army Training Corps. The vocational section was composed of enlisted men sent to Auburn for training in radio and mechanics. The students received honorable discharges two months later following the Armistice that ended [[World War I]]. API struggled through the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]], having scrapped an extensive expansion program by then-President [[Bradford Knapp]]. Faculty salaries were cut drastically, and enrollment decreased along with state appropriations to the college. By the end of the 1930s, Auburn had essentially recovered, but then faced new conditions caused by [[World War II]].\n\nAs war approached in 1940, there was a great shortage of engineers and scientists needed for the defense industries. The [[United States Department of Education|U.S. Office of Education]] asked all American engineering schools to join in a \"crash\" program to produce what was often called \"instant engineers.\" API became an early participant in an activity that eventually became [[Engineering, Science, and Management War Training]] (ESMWT). Fully funded by the government and coordinated by Auburn's Dean of Engineering, college-level courses were given in concentrated, mainly evening classes at sites across Alabama. Taken by thousands of adults \u2013 including many women \u2013 these courses were highly beneficial in filling the wartime ranks of civilian engineers, chemists, and other technical professionals. The ESMWT also benefited API by providing employment for faculty members when the student body was significantly diminished by [[Conscription in the United States|the draft]] and volunteer enlistment.\n\nDuring the war, API also trained U.S. military personnel on campus; between 1941 and 1945, Auburn produced over 32,000 troops for the war effort. Following the end of World War II, API, like many colleges around the country, experienced a period of massive growth caused by returning military personnel taking advantage of their [[GI Bill]] offer of free education. In the five-year period following the end of the war, enrollment at API more than doubled.\n\n===Name change to Auburn===\n[[File:AuburnTigers.svg|thumb|right|upright=0.75|Current Auburn Athletics logo]]\n\nRecognizing the school had moved beyond its agricultural and mechanical roots, it was granted university status by the Alabama Legislature in 1960 and renamed Auburn University, a name that better expressed the varied academic programs and expanded curriculum that the school had been offering for years. However, it was popularly called \"Auburn\" for many years before the official name change.\n\n===Civil Rights era to present===\nAuburn University was [[racial segregation|racially segregated]] prior to 1963, with only white students being admitted.

Its College of Architecture, Design, and Construction pioneered the nation's first Design Build master's degree program, capitalizing on the College's Building Science program with Auburn's \"Rural Studio\" program where Architectural students build highly creative and ingenious homes for some of the poorest regions of Alabama. These homes and efforts have been publicized by People Magazine, Time, featured on The Oprah Winfrey Show, numerous Architectural and Construction periodicals as well. Of special mention is the School's [[Rural Studio]] program, founded by the late [[Samuel Mockbee]].\n\nThe Samuel Ginn College of Engineering has a 134-year tradition of engineering education, consistently ranking in the nation's largest 20 engineering programs in terms of numbers of engineers graduating annually. The college has a combined enrollment of close to 4,000. Auburn's College of Engineering offers majors in civil, mechanical, electrical, industrial and systems engineering, polymer and fiber engineering, aerospace, agricultural, bio-systems, materials, chemical engineering, computer science, and software engineering, and\u2014more recently\u2014began a program in [[wireless engineering]] after receiving a donation from alumnus [[Samuel L. Ginn]]. In 2001, Ginn, a noted U.S. pioneer in wireless communication, made a $25 million gift to the college and announced plans to spearhead an additional $150 million in support. This gave Auburn the first Bachelor of Wireless Engineering degree program in the United States. Auburn University was the first university in the Southeast to offer the bachelor of software engineering degree and the master of software engineering degree.\n\n[[File:Ross Chemistry Laboratory on the Auburn University campus, Alabama LCCN2010639196.tif|alt=|left|thumb|307x307px|Ross Hall, home to Auburn's Department of Chemical Engineering]]\nAuburn has historically placed much of its emphasis on the education of engineers at the undergraduate level, and in recent years has been ranked as high as the 10th largest undergraduate engineering program in the U.S. in terms of the number of undergraduate degrees awarded on annual basis. The Ginn College of Engineering is now focused on expanding the graduate programs, and was recently ranked 60th nationally university with doctoral programs in engineering by ''U.S. News & World Report''. Last year, the college ranked 67th among all engineering programs.\n\nAuburn's Economics Department (formerly in the College of Business, now in the College of Liberal Arts) was ranked 123rd in the world in 1999 by the ''Journal of Applied Econometrics''. Auburn was rated ahead of such international powerhouses as INSEAD in France (141st) and the London Business School (146th). Auburn's MBA Program in the College of Business has annually been ranked by ''U.S. News & World Report magazine'' in the top ten percent of the nation's more than 750 MBA Programs. The [[Ludwig von Mises Institute]] (LvMI) offices were once located in the business department of Auburn University, and the LvMI continues to work with the university on many levels.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://mises.org/about/3467#part |title=Frequently Asked Questions |publisher= Mises Institute|website=Mises.org |date= |access-date=December 29, 2010}}</ref>\n\nROTC programs are available in three branches of service: Air Force, Army, and Navy/Marine Corps with the latter being the only one in Alabama. Over 100 officers that attended Auburn have reached flag rank (general or admiral), including one, [[Carl Epting Mundy Jr.]], who served as [[Commandant of the Marine Corps|Commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps]]. Auburn is one of only seven universities in the Nuclear Enlisted Commissioning Program, and has historically been one of the top ROTC producers of Navy nuclear submarine officers.\n\nIn addition to the ROTC graduates commissioned through Auburn, two master's degree alumni from Auburn, four-star generals [[Hugh Shelton]] and [[Richard Myers]], served as [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]] in the last decade. Both officers received their commissions elsewhere, and attended Auburn for an M.S. (Shelton) and M.B.A. (Myers).\n\nAuburn has graduated six astronauts (including [[Ken Mattingly|T.K. Mattingly]] of [[Apollo 13]] fame) and one current and one former director of the [[Kennedy Space Center]]. 1972 Auburn Mechanical Engineering graduate Jim Kennedy, currently director of NASA's Kennedy Space Center, was previously deputy director of [[NASA]]'s [[Marshall Space Flight Center]] (MSFC). Several hundred Auburn graduates, primarily engineers and scientists, currently work directly for NASA or NASA contractors. Hundreds of Auburn engineers worked for NASA at MSFC during the peak years of the \"space race\" in the 1960s, when the Saturn and Apollo moon programs were in full development.\n\n<div style=\"float:right; text-align:center;\">\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+'''Fall Freshman Statistics'''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://oira.auburn.edu/factbook/enrollment/newstudents/possass.aspx|title=Office of Institutional Research and Assessment|access-date=May 29, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150602042446/https://oira.auburn.edu/factbook/enrollment/newstudents/possass.aspx|archive-date=June 2, 2015|url-status=dead}}<br />* {{cite web|url=https://oira.auburn.edu/factbook/enrollment/newstudents/possasa.aspx|title=Office of Institutional Research and Assessment|access-date=May 29, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150601224549/https://oira.auburn.edu/factbook/enrollment/newstudents/possasa.aspx|archive-date=June 1, 2015|url-status=dead}}<br />* {{cite web|url=https://oira.auburn.edu/dictionary/cdsdefinitions.aspx|title=Office of Institutional Research and Assessment|access-date=May 29, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150601224840/https://oira.auburn.edu/dictionary/cdsdefinitions.aspx|archive-date=June 1, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n|-\n! &nbsp;\n!2015<ref>{{cite web|title= Office of Institutional Research|url= https://web.auburn.edu/ir/cds/2015/sectionc.aspx|website= web.auburn.edu|access-date= December 28, 2015}}</ref>\n!2014<ref>{{cite web|title= Office of Institutional Research|url= https://web.auburn.edu/ir/cds/2014/sectionc.aspx|website= web.auburn.edu|access-date= December 28, 2015}}</ref>!! 2013<ref>{{cite web|title= Office of Institutional Research|url= https://web.auburn.edu/ir/cds/2013/sectionc.aspx|website= web.auburn.edu|access-date= December 28, 2015}}</ref> !! 2012<ref>{{cite web|title= Office of Institutional Research|url= https://web.auburn.edu/ir/cds/2012/sectionc.aspx|website= web.auburn.edu|access-date= December 28, 2015}}</ref> !! 2011<ref>{{cite web|title= Office of Institutional Research|url= https://web.auburn.edu/ir/cds/2011/sectionc.aspx|website= web.auburn.edu|access-date= December 28, 2015}}</ref> !! 2010<ref>{{cite web|title= Office of Institutional Research|url= https://web.auburn.edu/ir/cds/2010/sectionc.aspx|website= web.auburn.edu|access-date= December 28, 2015}}</ref> !! 2009<ref>{{cite web|title= Office of Institutional Research|url= https://web.auburn.edu/ir/cds/2009/sectionc.aspx|website= web.auburn.edu|access-date= December 28, 2015}}</ref> !! 2008<ref>{{cite web|title= Office of Institutional Research|url= https://web.auburn.edu/ir/cds/2008/sectionc.aspx|website= web.auburn.edu|access-date= December 28, 2015}}</ref>\n|-\n!

Hargis]]\n\nThe Auburn campus is primarily arranged in a grid-like pattern with several distinct building groups. The northern section of the central campus (bounded by Magnolia Ave. and Thach Ave.) contains most of the College of Engineering buildings, the Lowder business building, and the older administration buildings. The middle section of the central campus (bounded by Thach Ave. and Roosevelt Dr.) contains the College of Liberal Arts (except fine arts) and the College of Education, mostly within Haley Center. The southern section of the central campus (bounded by Roosevelt Dr. and Samford Ave.) contains the most of the buildings related to the College of Science and Mathematics, as well as fine arts buildings.\n\nSeveral erratic building spurts, beginning in the 1950s, have resulted in some exceptions to the subject clusters as described above. Growing interaction issues between pedestrians and vehicles led to the closure of a significant portion of Thach Avenue to vehicular traffic in 2004. A similarly sized portion of Roosevelt Drive was also closed to vehicles in 2005. In an effort to make a more appealing walkway, these two sections have been converted from asphalt to concrete. The general movement towards a pedestrian only campus is ongoing, but is often limited by the requirements for emergency and maintenance vehicular access.\n\n[[File:Cater Hall Auburn University.JPG|alt=|left|thumb|255x255px|Katharine Cooper Cater Hall]]\nThe current period of ongoing construction began around the year 2000. All recently constructed buildings have used a more traditional architectural style that is similar to the style of Samford Hall, Mary Martin Hall, and the Quad dorms. The Science Center complex was completed in 2005. This complex contains chemistry labs, traditional classrooms, and a large lecture hall. A new medical clinic opened behind the Hill dorm area. Taking the place of the old medical clinic and a few other older buildings, is the Shelby Center for Engineering Technology.

Even into the 1970s, boarding houses were still available in the community. It wasn't until the [[Great Depression]] that Auburn began to construct the first buildings on campus that were residence halls in the modern sense. As the university gradually shifted away from agricultural and military instruction to more of an academic institution, more and more dorms began to replace the barracks and boarding houses.\n\nIn the 1980s, the City of Auburn began to experience rapid growth in the number of apartment complexes constructed. Most Auburn students today live off-campus in the apartment complexes and condos, which surround the immediate area around the university. Only 19 percent of all undergraduate students at Auburn live on campus.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://collegesearch.collegeboard.com/search/CollegeDetail.jsp?collegeId=1608&profileId=8 |title=College Search |publisher=Auburn University \u2013 Housing & Campus Life |date= |access-date=December 29, 2010}}</ref>\n\nAuburn's on-campus student housing consists of five complexes located at various locations over campus \u2013 The Quad, The Hill, The Village, Cambridge, and South Donahue.\n* The Quad is the oldest of the five housing complexes, dating to the Great Depression projects begun by the [[Works Progress Administration]] and located in Central Campus. Comprising ten buildings split into the Upper and Lower Quads, the Quad houses undergraduate students. Eight of the buildings are coed by floor, the remaining two are female-only. The Upper Quad comprises four Honors College dorms.\n* The Hill consists of 12 buildings and is located in South Campus. The Hill houses mostly undergraduates. There are two high-rise, 6-story dormitories (Boyd and Sasnett), and all dorms are coed (but have gender-separated floors) with the exception of Leischuck and Hall M, which are female only. All of the Hill dormitories were previously used to house sororities until 2009. The sororities are now housed in the newer Village complex.\n* The Village was constructed in 2009 and includes eight 4-story buildings to accommodate 1,700 residents. This complex houses undergraduates and sororities.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theplainsman.com/front/board_approves_tuition_increase_new_residence_halls |title=Board approves tuition increase, new residence halls |work=The Auburn Plainsman |access-date=April 29, 2007}}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}}</ref>\n*Cambridge was bought by Auburn University and converted from a hotel to a residence hall in 2010. It is a five-story building accommodating 300 students.\n* South Donahue opened in 2013 and is a single residence hall located on the corner of South Donahue and West Samford, right next to the baseball stadium. These are luxury suites consisting of two bedrooms with a shared common area. Each bedroom has a double-sized bed, and each suite comes fit with a mounted flat-screen TV and its own washer and dryer units.\n\n===Greek life===\nAuburn has an above-average size Greek system.  Greek associated students make up about 21% of undergraduate men and 43% of undergraduate women at Auburn.<ref>https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/auburn-university-1009/student-life</ref> \n\nAuburn's Greek system was behind most of the nation's public college Greek systems with integration, the first African-American student to be initiated into a historically white sorority happened in 2001.<ref name=wcdb>{{cite web|last1=Belanger|first1=Evan|title=How racially diverse is Auburn's Greek system?

In 2018, an African-American student became the first [[person of color]] president of a historically white Greek organization on campus.<ref>https://www.theplainsman.com/article/2018/04/auburns-first-african-american-sorority-president-shares-her-panhellenic-experience</ref>\n\nInterfraternity Council fraternities at Auburn are roughly divided into two separate areas: \"Old Row\" and \"New Row\". \"Old Row\" traditionally was made up of the fraternities whose houses were located along Magnolia Avenue on the north side of campus. \"New Row\" is made up of fraternities whose houses were located along Lem Morrison Drive southwest of campus. However, being an \"Old Row\" or \"New Row\" fraternity does not really depend on where the house is located but on the age of the fraternity. Therefore, there are some \"Old Row\" fraternities with houses on \"New Row\" Lem Morrison Drive because they moved there. Today's \"Old Row\" on and around Magnolia Avenue was once the \"New Row\", as the first generation of fraternity houses at Auburn were on or near College Street. Most of these houses were demolished by the end of the 1970s, and only the [[Phi Gamma Delta]] and [[Chi Phi]] fraternities remain. Some fraternity houses are not located on either \"New Row\" or \"Old Row\".  Only Auburn's historically white fraternities have traditional Greek mansions and houses.<ref>https://www.al.com/living/2016/06/auburn_frats.html</ref>\n\nInterfraternity Council fraternities: [[Alpha Epsilon Pi]], [[Alpha Gamma Rho]], [[Alpha Psi]], [[Alpha Sigma Phi]], [[Alpha Tau Omega]], [[Beta Theta Pi]], [[Beta Upsilon Chi]], [[Chi Phi]], [[Delta Chi]], [[Delta Tau Delta]], [[Farmhouse]], [[Kappa Alpha Order]], [[Kappa Sigma]], [[Lambda Chi Alpha]], [[Phi Delta Theta]], [[Phi Gamma Delta]], [[Phi Kappa Psi]], [[Phi Kappa Tau]], [[Phi Sigma Kappa]], [[Pi Kappa Alpha]], [[Pi Kappa Phi]], [[Sigma Chi]], [[Sigma Nu]], [[Sigma Pi]], [[Sigma Tau Gamma]], [[Tau Kappa Epsilon]], and [[Theta Chi]]\n\nThere are eighteen Panhellenic Council sororities represented at Auburn University.  The Auburn Panhellenic community donates roughly $500,000 and over 60,000 hours to various philanthropies every year.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.al.com/living/2016/07/auburn_sororities_through_the.html|title=12 facts you might not know about Auburn sororities|first=Amber|last=Sutton|date=July 28, 2016|website=al.com}}</ref>  [[Sorority Recruitment|Sorority recruitment]] is a week-long process held by the Panhellenic Council in August of every year.  Each Panhellenic Council sorority at Auburn has over 200 members. Panhellenic Council sororities are not based in individual mansions and houses like Auburn's historically white fraternities, but in The Village on campus in Magnolia Hall, Oak Hall, and Willow Hall.  Each of the three buildings house six sororities.  Each sorority has an individual \"chapter\" room on the first floor for meetings and a \"hall\" where members can live located above on the second, third, or fourth floor of the same building.  Usually the sorority's officers and members of the sophomore class live on the \"hall\".  \n\n[[Panhellenic Council]] sororities: [[Alpha Chi Omega]], [[Alpha Delta Pi]], [[Alpha Gamma Delta]], [[Alpha Omicron Pi]], [[Alpha Xi Delta]], [[Chi Omega]], [[Delta Delta Delta]], [[Delta Gamma]], [[Delta Zeta]], [[Gamma Phi Beta]], [[Kappa Alpha Theta]], [[Kappa Delta]], [[Kappa Kappa Gamma]], [[Pi Beta Phi]], [[Phi Mu]], [[Sigma Kappa]], [[Sigma Sigma Sigma]], and [[Zeta Tau Alpha]]\n\nAlthough a few of Auburn's [[National Pan-Hellenic Council|National Pan-Hellenic Council (NPHC)]] organizations are inactive, all nine  have been established on campus:\n[[Alpha Phi Alpha]], [[Alpha Kappa Alpha]], [[Kappa Alpha Psi]], [[Omega Psi Phi]], [[Delta Sigma Theta]], [[Phi Beta Sigma]], [[Zeta Phi Beta]], [[Sigma Gamma Rho]], and [[Iota Phi Theta]].  In 2019, Auburn's Board of Trustees approved the building of a $250K NPHC Legacy Plaza on campus with the intentions of improving recruitment, representation and retention of black students at Auburn which have been on a decline since its all-time high in 2007.<ref>https://www.theplainsman.com/article/2018/10/auburn-university-given-failing-grade-for-racial-equity</ref>  When the plaza is complete in 2022, Auburn will be the second SEC school to have a NPHC Legacy Plaza.  None of Auburn's NPHC organizations have traditional Greek mansions and houses so the plaza will be the first architectural indication of NPHC's presence on campus.<ref>https://www.theplainsman.com/article/2019/10/auburn-to-be-second-sec-school-with-nphc-legacy-plaza</ref>\n\nAuburn's Multicultural Greek Council is composed of [[Kappa Delta Chi]] and [[Omega Delta Phi]].  Both were established on campus in 2016 and have no architectural presence at Auburn.\n\n==Athletics==\n[[File:Aubie-01.jpg|thumb|right|[[Aubie]], the Auburn University Tiger Mascot]]\n{{Main|Auburn Tigers}}\n\nAuburn University's sports teams are known as the '''Tigers''', and they participate in [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I-A]] of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] and in the Western Division of the 14-member [[Southeastern Conference]] (SEC). [[War Eagle]] is the battle cry and greeting used by the Auburn Family (students, alumni, and fans).

Auburn has also won a total of 70 [[Southeastern Conference]] championships, including 51 men's titles and 19 women's titles. Auburn's colors of orange and blue were chosen by [[George Petrie (American football)|Dr. George Petrie]], Auburn's first football coach, based on those of his alma mater, the [[University of Virginia]].\n\n===Football===\n[[File:1913 Auburn football team Champions of South.jpg|alt=|thumb|474x474px|[[Auburn Tigers football|Auburn Tigers]] undefeated 1913 team]]\n{{Main|Auburn Tigers football}} <!-- Editors, please consider adding new content to the main article, [[Auburn Tigers football]] instead. -->\n\nAuburn named [[Gus Malzahn]] as the new football head coach on December 4, 2012. Other past coaches include [[Gene Chizik]], [[George Petrie (American football)|George Petrie]], [[John Heisman]], [[Mike Donahue]], [[Jack Meagher]], [[Ralph Jordan|Ralph \"Shug\" Jordan]], [[Pat Dye]], [[Terry Bowden]] and [[Tommy Tuberville]].\n\nAuburn played its first game in 1892 against the [[Georgia Bulldogs football|University of Georgia]] at [[Piedmont Park]] in [[Atlanta]] starting what is currently the oldest college football rivalry in the [[Deep South]]. Auburn's first perfect season came in [[1913 Auburn Tigers football team|1913]], when the Tigers went 8\u20130, claiming a second SIAA conference championship and the first national championship in school history. The Tigers' first bowl appearance was in 1937 in the sixth [[Bacardi Bowl]] played in [[Havana]], [[Cuba]]. AU football has won twelve SEC Conference Championships, and since the division of the conference in 1992, eight western division championships and six trips to the SEC Championship game. Auburn plays arch-rival [[Alabama Crimson Tide football|Alabama]] each year in a game known as the [[Iron Bowl]].\n\nIn [[1957 Auburn Tigers football team|1957]], Auburn was coached by \"Shug\" Jordan to a 10\u20130 record and was awarded the AP National Championship. Ohio State University was first in the UPI coaches' poll. Auburn was ineligible for a bowl game, however, having been placed on probation by the Southeastern Conference.\n\nThree Auburn players, [[Pat Sullivan (American football)|Pat Sullivan]] in 1971, [[Bo Jackson]] in 1985, and [[Cam Newton]] in 2010 have won the [[Heisman Trophy]]. The Trophy's namesake, [[John Heisman]], coached at Auburn from 1895 until 1899. Auburn is the only school where Heisman coached (among others, [[Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets football|Georgia Tech]] and [[Clemson Tigers football|Clemson]]) that has produced multiple Heisman Trophy winners. Auburn's [[Jordan\u2013Hare Stadium]] has a capacity of 87,451 ranking as the ninth-largest on-campus stadium in the NCAA {{as of|2006|September|lc=y}}.\n\n[[File:Jordan hare stadium.jpg|thumb|left|[[Jordan\u2013Hare Stadium]], 2005]]\nAuburn went 11\u20130 under Terry Bowden in 1993, but was on probation and not allowed to play in the SEC Championship game. Auburn completed the 2004 football season with a 13\u20130 record winning the [[Southeastern Conference|SEC]] championship, the school's first conference title since 1989 and the first outright title since 1987. The 2004 team was led by quarterback [[Jason Campbell]], running backs [[Carnell Williams]] and [[Ronnie Brown]], and cornerback [[Carlos Rogers (American football)|Carlos Rogers]], all subsequently drafted in the first round of the [[2005 NFL Draft]]. The team's new offensive coordinator, [[Al Borges]], led the team to use the [[west coast offense|west coast style offense]] which maximized the use of both star running backs. However, the Tigers were ranked behind two other undefeated teams, [[2004 USC Trojans football team|Southern California]] and [[2004 Oklahoma Sooners football team|Oklahoma]], that played in the [[Bowl Championship Series|BCS]] championship game.\n\nPrior to the 2008 season, Tony Franklin was hired as offensive coordinator to put Auburn into the spread offense. He was fired, however, following the sixth game of the season that ended in a loss to Vanderbilt. Tommy Tuberville then resigned as head coach after the season. On December 13, 2008, it was reported that [[Gene Chizik]] had been hired as Auburn's new head coach.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sportingnews.com/yourturn/viewtopic.php?t=496642 |title=Auburn hires Gene Chizik as football coach |access-date=December 13, 2008 |date=December 13, 2008 |publisher=Sporting News |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216160910/http://www.sportingnews.com/yourturn/viewtopic.php?t=496642 |archivedate=December 16, 2008 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Coach Gene Chizik then hired [[Gus Malzahn]] as the Tigers' new Offensive Coordinator.\n\n[[File:Rolling Toomers Corner Auburn University.jpg|thumb|left|The Auburn tradition of rolling Toomer's Corner after a sports win]]\nIn [[2010 Auburn Tigers football team|2010]], Auburn defeated [[2010 Oregon Ducks football team|Oregon]] 22\u201319 in the [[2011 BCS National Championship Game]] to secure the school's second national championship. The Tigers finished the season with a 14\u20130 record, including comeback wins over [[2010 Clemson Tigers football team|Clemson]], [[2010 South Carolina Gamecocks football team|South Carolina]], [[2010 Georgia Bulldogs football team|Georgia]], and [[2010 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|Alabama]]. The Tigers trailed the Tide 24\u20130 in Tuscaloosa, but managed a 28\u201327 comeback victory in the 75th edition of the [[Iron Bowl]]. Auburn would again defeat South Carolina 56\u201317 in the [[2010 SEC Championship Game]], claiming the school's eleventh conference championship. The Tigers were led by head coach Gene Chizik, offensive coordinator Gus Malzahn, quarterback and Heisman Trophy winner [[Cam Newton]], and defensive tackle and Lombardi Award winner [[Nick Fairley]]. In Malzahn's first season as head coach (2013), Auburn had two miraculous finishes in the final minute against Georgia and Alabama to win the SEC West. They went on to win the 2013 SEC Championship Game over Missouri and fell short in the [[2014 BCS National Championship Game]] to the [[Florida State Seminoles]] 34\u201331 in [[Pasadena, California]]. <!-- Keep this a summary.

On Hey Days now, students are asked to put on name tags, handed out by student body leaders, and encouraged to say \"hey\" to whomever may pass them by during the day.<ref name=\"Auburn Traditions\">{{cite web|url=http://www.auburntigers.com/trads/01_auburn_tradition.html|title=Official Athletics Site of the Auburn Tigers \u2013 Traditions|publisher=AuburnTigers.com|access-date=May 29, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150503170727/http://www.auburntigers.com/trads/01_auburn_tradition.html|archive-date=May 3, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Auburn's Eagles===\nAuburn has currently two eagles in their flight program for educational initiatives. One of these educational programs is known as the pregame flight program where the eagle handlers set an eagle free before Auburn takes the field at Jordan Hare Stadium. The eagle then proceeds to fly around the stadium and eventually land in the middle of the field.\n\nTiger, also known as War Eagle VI, was born in 1980 in captivity and given to Auburn University in 1986. Tiger's first flight before an Auburn Football game came against Wyoming in 2000. She retired after the Georgia game in 2006. Throughout Tiger's career, she flew many different flights and at many different venues including the 2002 Winter Olympics. Tiger died at the age of 34 in 2014.<ref name=\"Auburn Traditions\" />\n\nAuburn's first Flight program eagle is Nova, War Eagle VII. His first flight came before Auburn's game against Kentucky in 2004. He was born at the Montgomery zoo and given to Auburn a year later.\n\nSpirit is the only Bald Eagle Auburn has used for its pregame flight program. His first flight was in 2000. Spirit was found as a baby with an injured beak and nursed back to health before being given to Auburn for further rehabilitation in 1998. Unfortunately, Spirit's beak was damaged to the point that it is impossible for his release back into the wild.<ref name=\"Auburn Traditions\" />\n\n===Aubie the Tiger===\nAuburn's mascot, [[Aubie]] the tiger, has been around since 1959. He made his first appearance that year on the October 3 gameday football program versus [[Hardin\u2013Simmons Cowboys football|Hardin-Simmons College]]. Aubie was the creation of ''[[Birmingham Post-Herald]]'' artist Phil Neel and was the focal point of Auburn's football programs for 18 years. Auburn Football experienced good luck while Aubie remained on the cover, ending with a 23\u20132\u20131 home record and 63\u201316\u20132 overall record while he was on the program cover. Aubie the tiger is still currently Auburn's official mascot and has won the most National Mascot titles in the contest's history, with nine.<ref name=\"Aubie The Tiger\">{{cite web|url=http://studentaffairs.auburn.edu/2016/02/05/aubie-named-2016-mascot-national-champion/|title=Aubie Named 2016 Mascot National Champion |work= Auburn University Student Affairs}}</ref>\n\n===Auburn Football Tiger Walk===\nAuburn's Tiger Walk began in the 1960s, after fans would try to stop the players and get autographs before the games. It has since evolved into the spectacle, where fans line Donahue Drive to cheer on the team as they make their way from the athletic complex to the field. The highest point of the tiger walk came in 1989, when Auburn and Alabama played each other for the first time away from [[Legion Field]] in Birmingham. It is estimated that around 20,000 Auburn fans came out and lined the street to cheer on the team that day.<ref name=\"Auburn Traditions\" />\n\n===War Eagle chant theories===\nDuring Auburn's game against Georgia in 1892, a civil war veteran in the stands brought his pet eagle that he found on a battleground during the war. The eagle during the game flew away from the soldier and began circling the field in the air. As all this went on, Auburn began marching down the field to eventually score the game-winning touchdown. At the end of the game, the eagle dove into the ground and subsequently died; however, the Auburn faithful took the eagle as an omen of success and coined the phrase \"WAR EAGLE\" in turn.<ref name=\"Auburn Tigers\">{{cite web|url=http://www.al.com/auburnfootball/|title=Auburn football \u2013 Auburn Tigers Football NCAA News |work=al.com|access-date=May 29, 2015}}</ref>\n\nDuring a pep rally in 1913, a cheerleader said that the team would have to fight the whole game because the game meant \"war.\" At the same time of the rally, an eagle emblem fell on a student's military hat. When asked what it was, he yelled it was a \"War Eagle\".<ref name=\"Auburn Traditions\" />\n\nDuring a game against the Carlisle Indian Team in 1914, Auburn attempted to single out Carlisle's toughest player, Bald Eagle. To tire him out, they began running the ball his way during every play, by saying \"bald eagle\", while in formation. The crowd mistook this and began yelling \"War Eagle\", instead, leading to Auburn's player, Lucy Hairston, to yell \"War Eagle\" at the end of the game, after he scored the game-winning touchdown.<ref name=\"Auburn Traditions\" />\n\nAfter a battle, the Saxon warriors would yell \"War Eagle\", when the buzzards started to circle the battlefields. Some believe that Auburn coined its battle cry from this practice by the Saxons.<ref name=\"Auburn Traditions\" />\n\n===Toomer's Corner===\nThe tradition of rolling Toomer's Corner on Auburn's campus after winning home and big away games is thought to have originated in the 1950s. The tradition is thought to have spawned from when the owner of Toomer's Drugs, Sheldon Toomer, would toss his receipt paper into the trees to signal an Auburn road victory. This iconic tradition was ranked by USA Today as the \"Best Sports Tradition\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2257393-behind-the-auburn-tradition-of-rolling-toomers-corner |title=Behind the Auburn Tradition of Rolling Toomer's Corner|author=BR Studios|work=Bleacher Report|access-date=May 29, 2015}}<br />* {{cite web|url=http://www.theplainsman.com/article/2018/03/rolling-of-toomers-corner-oaks-voted-best-sports-tradition|title=Rolling of Toomer's Corner Oaks voted 'Best Sports Tradition'|author=The Plainsman|work=The Plainsman |access-date=March 9, 2018}}<br />* {{cite web|url=https://www.10best.com/awards/travel/best-sports-tradition/|title=10 Best Sports Traditions|author=USA Today|work=USA Today|access-date=March 9, 2018}}</ref> In November 2010, Harvey Updike Jr. poisoned the beloved trees at Toomer's Corner using 80DF after Auburn beat rival and Updike's team of choice 28\u201327.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.al.com/news/index.ssf/2015/11/harvey_updyke_poisoned_toomers.html|title=Harvey Updyke poisoned Toomer's Corner oaks 5 years ago|work=AL.com|access-date=October 30, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Selected organizations==\n===Media and publications===\n* ''[[The Auburn Plainsman]]'' \u2013 the university's student-run newspaper, has won 23 [[National Pacemaker Awards]] from the [[Associated Collegiate Press]] since 1966.

Sasnett]], and the school opened its doors in 1859 to a student body of eighty and a faculty of ten.\n\nAuburn's early history is inextricably linked with the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] and the [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]]-era [[Southern United States#Reconstruction and Jim Crow|South]]. Classes were held in \"Old Main\" until the college was closed due to the war, when most of the students and faculty left to enlist. The campus was a training ground for the [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] Army, and \"Old Main\" served as a hospital for Confederate wounded.\n\nTo commemorate Auburn's contribution to the Civil War, a cannon lathe used for the manufacture of cannons for the Confederate Army and recovered from [[Selma, Alabama]], was presented to the college in 1952 by brothers of Delta Chapter of the [[Alpha Phi Omega]] fraternity.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/codelemur/5108012123/in/set-72157625100858387|title= The Cannon Lathe plaque|access-date= January 17, 2011}}</ref> It sits today on the lawn next to [[Samford Hall]].\n\n===Post-Civil War===\nThe school reopened in 1866 after the end of the Civil War, its only closure. In 1872, control of the institution was transferred from the Methodist Church to the State of [[Alabama]] for financial reasons. Alabama placed the school under the provisions of the [[Morrill Act]] as a [[Land-grant colleges|land-grant institution]], the first in the South to be established separately from the state university.{{clarify|What does this sentence's last passage mean?|date=March 2017}} This act provided for 240,000 acres (971&nbsp;km{{sup|2}}) of Federal land to be sold to provide funds for an agricultural and mechanical school. As a result, in 1872 the school was renamed the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Alabama.\n\nUnder the act's provisions, land-grant institutions were also supposed to teach military tactics and train officers for the United States military. In the late 19th century, most students at the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Alabama were enrolled in the cadet program, learning military tactics and training to become officers. Each county in the state was allowed to nominate two cadets to attend the college free of charge.\n\n[[File:1890s Samford Hall Auburn Alabama.jpg|thumb|right|250px|[[Samford Hall]] in the 1890s]]\nThe university's original curriculum focused on engineering and agriculture. This trend changed under the guidance of [[William Leroy Broun]], who taught classics and sciences and believed both disciplines were important for the growth of the university and the individual. In 1892, two historic events occurred: women were admitted to the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Alabama, and football was played as a school sport. Eventually, football replaced polo as the main sport on campus. The college was renamed the Alabama Polytechnic Institute (API) in 1899, largely because of Broun's influence.<ref name=\"Auburn history\"/>\n\n[[File:Auburn cadets.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.15|API [[Cadet]]s drill on Ross Square in 1918]]\nOn October 1, 1918, nearly all of Alabama Polytechnic Institute's able-bodied male students 18 or older voluntarily joined the [[United States Army]] for short-lived military careers on campus. The student-soldiers numbered 878, according to API president Charles Thach, and formed the academic section of the Student Army Training Corps. The vocational section was composed of enlisted men sent to Auburn for training in radio and mechanics. The students received honorable discharges two months later following the Armistice that ended [[World War I]]. API struggled through the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]], having scrapped an extensive expansion program by then-President [[Bradford Knapp]]. Faculty salaries were cut drastically, and enrollment decreased along with state appropriations to the college. By the end of the 1930s, Auburn had essentially recovered, but then faced new conditions caused by [[World War II]].\n\nAs war approached in 1940, there was a great shortage of engineers and scientists needed for the defense industries. The [[United States Department of Education|U.S. Office of Education]] asked all American engineering schools to join in a \"crash\" program to produce what was often called \"instant engineers.\" API became an early participant in an activity that eventually became [[Engineering, Science, and Management War Training]] (ESMWT). Fully funded by the government and coordinated by Auburn's Dean of Engineering, college-level courses were given in concentrated, mainly evening classes at sites across Alabama. Taken by thousands of adults \u2013 including many women \u2013 these courses were highly beneficial in filling the wartime ranks of civilian engineers, chemists, and other technical professionals. The ESMWT also benefited API by providing employment for faculty members when the student body was significantly diminished by [[Conscription in the United States|the draft]] and volunteer enlistment.\n\nDuring the war, API also trained U.S. military personnel on campus; between 1941 and 1945, Auburn produced over 32,000 troops for the war effort. Following the end of World War II, API, like many colleges around the country, experienced a period of massive growth caused by returning military personnel taking advantage of their [[GI Bill]] offer of free education. In the five-year period following the end of the war, enrollment at API more than doubled.\n\n===Name change to Auburn===\n[[File:AuburnTigers.svg|thumb|right|upright=0.75|Current Auburn Athletics logo]]\n\nRecognizing the school had moved beyond its agricultural and mechanical roots, it was granted university status by the Alabama Legislature in 1960 and renamed Auburn University, a name that better expressed the varied academic programs and expanded curriculum that the school had been offering for years. However, it was popularly called \"Auburn\" for many years before the official name change.\n\n===Civil Rights era to present===\nAuburn University was [[racial segregation|racially segregated]] prior to 1963, with only white students being admitted. Integration began in 1964 with the admittance of the first African-American student, Harold A.

The college has a combined enrollment of close to 4,000. Auburn's College of Engineering offers majors in civil, mechanical, electrical, industrial and systems engineering, polymer and fiber engineering, aerospace, agricultural, bio-systems, materials, chemical engineering, computer science, and software engineering, and\u2014more recently\u2014began a program in [[wireless engineering]] after receiving a donation from alumnus [[Samuel L. Ginn]]. In 2001, Ginn, a noted U.S. pioneer in wireless communication, made a $25 million gift to the college and announced plans to spearhead an additional $150 million in support. This gave Auburn the first Bachelor of Wireless Engineering degree program in the United States. Auburn University was the first university in the Southeast to offer the bachelor of software engineering degree and the master of software engineering degree.\n\n[[File:Ross Chemistry Laboratory on the Auburn University campus, Alabama LCCN2010639196.tif|alt=|left|thumb|307x307px|Ross Hall, home to Auburn's Department of Chemical Engineering]]\nAuburn has historically placed much of its emphasis on the education of engineers at the undergraduate level, and in recent years has been ranked as high as the 10th largest undergraduate engineering program in the U.S. in terms of the number of undergraduate degrees awarded on annual basis. The Ginn College of Engineering is now focused on expanding the graduate programs, and was recently ranked 60th nationally university with doctoral programs in engineering by ''U.S. News & World Report''. Last year, the college ranked 67th among all engineering programs.\n\nAuburn's Economics Department (formerly in the College of Business, now in the College of Liberal Arts) was ranked 123rd in the world in 1999 by the ''Journal of Applied Econometrics''. Auburn was rated ahead of such international powerhouses as INSEAD in France (141st) and the London Business School (146th). Auburn's MBA Program in the College of Business has annually been ranked by ''U.S. News & World Report magazine'' in the top ten percent of the nation's more than 750 MBA Programs.

Over 100 officers that attended Auburn have reached flag rank (general or admiral), including one, [[Carl Epting Mundy Jr.]], who served as [[Commandant of the Marine Corps|Commandant of the U.S. Marine Corps]]. Auburn is one of only seven universities in the Nuclear Enlisted Commissioning Program, and has historically been one of the top ROTC producers of Navy nuclear submarine officers.\n\nIn addition to the ROTC graduates commissioned through Auburn, two master's degree alumni from Auburn, four-star generals [[Hugh Shelton]] and [[Richard Myers]], served as [[Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff]] in the last decade. Both officers received their commissions elsewhere, and attended Auburn for an M.S. (Shelton) and M.B.A. (Myers).\n\nAuburn has graduated six astronauts (including [[Ken Mattingly|T.K.

Several hundred Auburn graduates, primarily engineers and scientists, currently work directly for NASA or NASA contractors. Hundreds of Auburn engineers worked for NASA at MSFC during the peak years of the \"space race\" in the 1960s, when the Saturn and Apollo moon programs were in full development.\n\n<div style=\"float:right; text-align:center;\">\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|+'''Fall Freshman Statistics'''<ref>{{cite web|url=https://oira.auburn.edu/factbook/enrollment/newstudents/possass.aspx|title=Office of Institutional Research and Assessment|access-date=May 29, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150602042446/https://oira.auburn.edu/factbook/enrollment/newstudents/possass.aspx|archive-date=June 2, 2015|url-status=dead}}<br />* {{cite web|url=https://oira.auburn.edu/factbook/enrollment/newstudents/possasa.aspx|title=Office of Institutional Research and Assessment|access-date=May 29, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150601224549/https://oira.auburn.edu/factbook/enrollment/newstudents/possasa.aspx|archive-date=June 1, 2015|url-status=dead}}<br />* {{cite web|url=https://oira.auburn.edu/dictionary/cdsdefinitions.aspx|title=Office of Institutional Research and Assessment|access-date=May 29, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150601224840/https://oira.auburn.edu/dictionary/cdsdefinitions.aspx|archive-date=June 1, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n|-\n! &nbsp;\n!2015<ref>{{cite web|title= Office of Institutional Research|url= https://web.auburn.edu/ir/cds/2015/sectionc.aspx|website= web.auburn.edu|access-date= December 28, 2015}}</ref>\n!2014<ref>{{cite web|title= Office of Institutional Research|url= https://web.auburn.edu/ir/cds/2014/sectionc.aspx|website= web.auburn.edu|access-date= December 28, 2015}}</ref>!! 2013<ref>{{cite web|title= Office of Institutional Research|url= https://web.auburn.edu/ir/cds/2013/sectionc.aspx|website= web.auburn.edu|access-date= December 28, 2015}}</ref> !! 2012<ref>{{cite web|title= Office of Institutional Research|url= https://web.auburn.edu/ir/cds/2012/sectionc.aspx|website= web.auburn.edu|access-date= December 28, 2015}}</ref> !! 2011<ref>{{cite web|title= Office of Institutional Research|url= https://web.auburn.edu/ir/cds/2011/sectionc.aspx|website= web.auburn.edu|access-date= December 28, 2015}}</ref> !! 2010<ref>{{cite web|title= Office of Institutional Research|url= https://web.auburn.edu/ir/cds/2010/sectionc.aspx|website= web.auburn.edu|access-date= December 28, 2015}}</ref> !! 2009<ref>{{cite web|title= Office of Institutional Research|url= https://web.auburn.edu/ir/cds/2009/sectionc.aspx|website= web.auburn.edu|access-date= December 28, 2015}}</ref> !! 2008<ref>{{cite web|title= Office of Institutional Research|url= https://web.auburn.edu/ir/cds/2008/sectionc.aspx|website= web.auburn.edu|access-date= December 28, 2015}}</ref>\n|-\n!

Hargis]]\n\nThe Auburn campus is primarily arranged in a grid-like pattern with several distinct building groups. The northern section of the central campus (bounded by Magnolia Ave. and Thach Ave.) contains most of the College of Engineering buildings, the Lowder business building, and the older administration buildings. The middle section of the central campus (bounded by Thach Ave. and Roosevelt Dr.) contains the College of Liberal Arts (except fine arts) and the College of Education, mostly within Haley Center. The southern section of the central campus (bounded by Roosevelt Dr. and Samford Ave.) contains the most of the buildings related to the College of Science and Mathematics, as well as fine arts buildings.\n\nSeveral erratic building spurts, beginning in the 1950s, have resulted in some exceptions to the subject clusters as described above. Growing interaction issues between pedestrians and vehicles led to the closure of a significant portion of Thach Avenue to vehicular traffic in 2004. A similarly sized portion of Roosevelt Drive was also closed to vehicles in 2005. In an effort to make a more appealing walkway, these two sections have been converted from asphalt to concrete. The general movement towards a pedestrian only campus is ongoing, but is often limited by the requirements for emergency and maintenance vehicular access.\n\n[[File:Cater Hall Auburn University.JPG|alt=|left|thumb|255x255px|Katharine Cooper Cater Hall]]\nThe current period of ongoing construction began around the year 2000. All recently constructed buildings have used a more traditional architectural style that is similar to the style of Samford Hall, Mary Martin Hall, and the Quad dorms. The Science Center complex was completed in 2005. This complex contains chemistry labs, traditional classrooms, and a large lecture hall. A new medical clinic opened behind the Hill dorm area. Taking the place of the old medical clinic and a few other older buildings, is the Shelby Center for Engineering Technology. Phase I of the Shelby Center opened in the Spring of 2008, with regular classes being held starting with the Summer 2008 term. A new Student Center opened in 2008.<ref>Auburn University Campus Map \u2013 http://oitapps.auburn.edu/campusmap/ click on each building for more information.<br />* Buildings at auburn University {{cite web|url=http://www.lib.auburn.edu/architecture/buildings/ |title=Explore the history of Auburn University's Campus |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080415174847/http://www.lib.auburn.edu/architecture/buildings/ |archivedate=April 15, 2008 |access-date=August 30, 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Student life==\n{| style=\"text-align:center; float:right; margin-left:1em; margin:auto;\" class=\"wikitable\"\n|+ ''Ethnic composition of student body \u2013 Fall 2016'<ref>{{cite web |title=Race/Ethnicitiy Enrollment by College/School FALL 2016 |url=https://web.auburn.edu/ir/factbook/enrollment/psbe/eebcs3.aspx |publisher=Auburn University |date=October 19, 2016}}</ref>\n|-\n!

Even into the 1970s, boarding houses were still available in the community. It wasn't until the [[Great Depression]] that Auburn began to construct the first buildings on campus that were residence halls in the modern sense. As the university gradually shifted away from agricultural and military instruction to more of an academic institution, more and more dorms began to replace the barracks and boarding houses.\n\nIn the 1980s, the City of Auburn began to experience rapid growth in the number of apartment complexes constructed. Most Auburn students today live off-campus in the apartment complexes and condos, which surround the immediate area around the university. Only 19 percent of all undergraduate students at Auburn live on campus.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://collegesearch.collegeboard.com/search/CollegeDetail.jsp?collegeId=1608&profileId=8 |title=College Search |publisher=Auburn University \u2013 Housing & Campus Life |date= |access-date=December 29, 2010}}</ref>\n\nAuburn's on-campus student housing consists of five complexes located at various locations over campus \u2013 The Quad, The Hill, The Village, Cambridge, and South Donahue.\n* The Quad is the oldest of the five housing complexes, dating to the Great Depression projects begun by the [[Works Progress Administration]] and located in Central Campus. Comprising ten buildings split into the Upper and Lower Quads, the Quad houses undergraduate students. Eight of the buildings are coed by floor, the remaining two are female-only. The Upper Quad comprises four Honors College dorms.\n* The Hill consists of 12 buildings and is located in South Campus. The Hill houses mostly undergraduates. There are two high-rise, 6-story dormitories (Boyd and Sasnett), and all dorms are coed (but have gender-separated floors) with the exception of Leischuck and Hall M, which are female only. All of the Hill dormitories were previously used to house sororities until 2009. The sororities are now housed in the newer Village complex.\n* The Village was constructed in 2009 and includes eight 4-story buildings to accommodate 1,700 residents. This complex houses undergraduates and sororities.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theplainsman.com/front/board_approves_tuition_increase_new_residence_halls |title=Board approves tuition increase, new residence halls |work=The Auburn Plainsman |access-date=April 29, 2007}}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes}}</ref>\n*Cambridge was bought by Auburn University and converted from a hotel to a residence hall in 2010. It is a five-story building accommodating 300 students.\n* South Donahue opened in 2013 and is a single residence hall located on the corner of South Donahue and West Samford, right next to the baseball stadium. These are luxury suites consisting of two bedrooms with a shared common area. Each bedroom has a double-sized bed, and each suite comes fit with a mounted flat-screen TV and its own washer and dryer units.\n\n===Greek life===\nAuburn has an above-average size Greek system.  Greek associated students make up about 21% of undergraduate men and 43% of undergraduate women at Auburn.<ref>https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/auburn-university-1009/student-life</ref> \n\nAuburn's Greek system was behind most of the nation's public college Greek systems with integration, the first African-American student to be initiated into a historically white sorority happened in 2001.<ref name=wcdb>{{cite web|last1=Belanger|first1=Evan|title=How racially diverse is Auburn's Greek system?

In 2018, an African-American student became the first [[person of color]] president of a historically white Greek organization on campus.<ref>https://www.theplainsman.com/article/2018/04/auburns-first-african-american-sorority-president-shares-her-panhellenic-experience</ref>\n\nInterfraternity Council fraternities at Auburn are roughly divided into two separate areas: \"Old Row\" and \"New Row\". \"Old Row\" traditionally was made up of the fraternities whose houses were located along Magnolia Avenue on the north side of campus. \"New Row\" is made up of fraternities whose houses were located along Lem Morrison Drive southwest of campus. However, being an \"Old Row\" or \"New Row\" fraternity does not really depend on where the house is located but on the age of the fraternity. Therefore, there are some \"Old Row\" fraternities with houses on \"New Row\" Lem Morrison Drive because they moved there. Today's \"Old Row\" on and around Magnolia Avenue was once the \"New Row\", as the first generation of fraternity houses at Auburn were on or near College Street. Most of these houses were demolished by the end of the 1970s, and only the [[Phi Gamma Delta]] and [[Chi Phi]] fraternities remain. Some fraternity houses are not located on either \"New Row\" or \"Old Row\".  Only Auburn's historically white fraternities have traditional Greek mansions and houses.<ref>https://www.al.com/living/2016/06/auburn_frats.html</ref>\n\nInterfraternity Council fraternities: [[Alpha Epsilon Pi]], [[Alpha Gamma Rho]], [[Alpha Psi]], [[Alpha Sigma Phi]], [[Alpha Tau Omega]], [[Beta Theta Pi]], [[Beta Upsilon Chi]], [[Chi Phi]], [[Delta Chi]], [[Delta Tau Delta]], [[Farmhouse]], [[Kappa Alpha Order]], [[Kappa Sigma]], [[Lambda Chi Alpha]], [[Phi Delta Theta]], [[Phi Gamma Delta]], [[Phi Kappa Psi]], [[Phi Kappa Tau]], [[Phi Sigma Kappa]], [[Pi Kappa Alpha]], [[Pi Kappa Phi]], [[Sigma Chi]], [[Sigma Nu]], [[Sigma Pi]], [[Sigma Tau Gamma]], [[Tau Kappa Epsilon]], and [[Theta Chi]]\n\nThere are eighteen Panhellenic Council sororities represented at Auburn University.  The Auburn Panhellenic community donates roughly $500,000 and over 60,000 hours to various philanthropies every year.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.al.com/living/2016/07/auburn_sororities_through_the.html|title=12 facts you might not know about Auburn sororities|first=Amber|last=Sutton|date=July 28, 2016|website=al.com}}</ref>  [[Sorority Recruitment|Sorority recruitment]] is a week-long process held by the Panhellenic Council in August of every year.  Each Panhellenic Council sorority at Auburn has over 200 members. Panhellenic Council sororities are not based in individual mansions and houses like Auburn's historically white fraternities, but in The Village on campus in Magnolia Hall, Oak Hall, and Willow Hall.  Each of the three buildings house six sororities.  Each sorority has an individual \"chapter\" room on the first floor for meetings and a \"hall\" where members can live located above on the second, third, or fourth floor of the same building.  Usually the sorority's officers and members of the sophomore class live on the \"hall\".  \n\n[[Panhellenic Council]] sororities: [[Alpha Chi Omega]], [[Alpha Delta Pi]], [[Alpha Gamma Delta]], [[Alpha Omicron Pi]], [[Alpha Xi Delta]], [[Chi Omega]], [[Delta Delta Delta]], [[Delta Gamma]], [[Delta Zeta]], [[Gamma Phi Beta]], [[Kappa Alpha Theta]], [[Kappa Delta]], [[Kappa Kappa Gamma]], [[Pi Beta Phi]], [[Phi Mu]], [[Sigma Kappa]], [[Sigma Sigma Sigma]], and [[Zeta Tau Alpha]]\n\nAlthough a few of Auburn's [[National Pan-Hellenic Council|National Pan-Hellenic Council (NPHC)]] organizations are inactive, all nine  have been established on campus:\n[[Alpha Phi Alpha]], [[Alpha Kappa Alpha]], [[Kappa Alpha Psi]], [[Omega Psi Phi]], [[Delta Sigma Theta]], [[Phi Beta Sigma]], [[Zeta Phi Beta]], [[Sigma Gamma Rho]], and [[Iota Phi Theta]].  In 2019, Auburn's Board of Trustees approved the building of a $250K NPHC Legacy Plaza on campus with the intentions of improving recruitment, representation and retention of black students at Auburn which have been on a decline since its all-time high in 2007.<ref>https://www.theplainsman.com/article/2018/10/auburn-university-given-failing-grade-for-racial-equity</ref>  When the plaza is complete in 2022, Auburn will be the second SEC school to have a NPHC Legacy Plaza.  None of Auburn's NPHC organizations have traditional Greek mansions and houses so the plaza will be the first architectural indication of NPHC's presence on campus.<ref>https://www.theplainsman.com/article/2019/10/auburn-to-be-second-sec-school-with-nphc-legacy-plaza</ref>\n\nAuburn's Multicultural Greek Council is composed of [[Kappa Delta Chi]] and [[Omega Delta Phi]].  Both were established on campus in 2016 and have no architectural presence at Auburn.\n\n==Athletics==\n[[File:Aubie-01.jpg|thumb|right|[[Aubie]], the Auburn University Tiger Mascot]]\n{{Main|Auburn Tigers}}\n\nAuburn University's sports teams are known as the '''Tigers''', and they participate in [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I-A]] of the [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] and in the Western Division of the 14-member [[Southeastern Conference]] (SEC). [[War Eagle]] is the battle cry and greeting used by the Auburn Family (students, alumni, and fans). Auburn has won a total of 21 intercollegiate national championships (including 17 NCAA Championships), which includes 2 [[College football national championships in NCAA Division I FBS|football]] (1957, 2010), 8 [[NCAA Men's Swimming and Diving Championships|men's swimming and diving]] (1997, 1999, 2003, 2004, 2005, 2006, 2007, 2009), 5 [[NCAA Women's Swimming and Diving Championships|women's swimming and diving]] (2002, 2003, 2004, 2006, 2007), 5 [[Equestrianism|equestrian]] (2008, 2011,2013, 2016, 2018), and 1 [[NCAA Women's Outdoor Track and Field Championship|women's outdoor track and field]] (2006) titles. Auburn has also won a total of 70 [[Southeastern Conference]] championships, including 51 men's titles and 19 women's titles. Auburn's colors of orange and blue were chosen by [[George Petrie (American football)|Dr. George Petrie]], Auburn's first football coach, based on those of his alma mater, the [[University of Virginia]].\n\n===Football===\n[[File:1913 Auburn football team Champions of South.jpg|alt=|thumb|474x474px|[[Auburn Tigers football|Auburn Tigers]] undefeated 1913 team]]\n{{Main|Auburn Tigers football}} <!-- Editors, please consider adding new content to the main article, [[Auburn Tigers football]] instead. -->\n\nAuburn named [[Gus Malzahn]] as the new football head coach on December 4, 2012. Other past coaches include [[Gene Chizik]], [[George Petrie (American football)|George Petrie]], [[John Heisman]], [[Mike Donahue]], [[Jack Meagher]], [[Ralph Jordan|Ralph \"Shug\" Jordan]], [[Pat Dye]], [[Terry Bowden]] and [[Tommy Tuberville]].\n\nAuburn played its first game in 1892 against the [[Georgia Bulldogs football|University of Georgia]] at [[Piedmont Park]] in [[Atlanta]] starting what is currently the oldest college football rivalry in the [[Deep South]]. Auburn's first perfect season came in [[1913 Auburn Tigers football team|1913]], when the Tigers went 8\u20130, claiming a second SIAA conference championship and the first national championship in school history. The Tigers' first bowl appearance was in 1937 in the sixth [[Bacardi Bowl]] played in [[Havana]], [[Cuba]]. AU football has won twelve SEC Conference Championships, and since the division of the conference in 1992, eight western division championships and six trips to the SEC Championship game. Auburn plays arch-rival [[Alabama Crimson Tide football|Alabama]] each year in a game known as the [[Iron Bowl]].\n\nIn [[1957 Auburn Tigers football team|1957]], Auburn was coached by \"Shug\" Jordan to a 10\u20130 record and was awarded the AP National Championship. Ohio State University was first in the UPI coaches' poll. Auburn was ineligible for a bowl game, however, having been placed on probation by the Southeastern Conference.\n\nThree Auburn players, [[Pat Sullivan (American football)|Pat Sullivan]] in 1971, [[Bo Jackson]] in 1985, and [[Cam Newton]] in 2010 have won the [[Heisman Trophy]]. The Trophy's namesake, [[John Heisman]], coached at Auburn from 1895 until 1899. Auburn is the only school where Heisman coached (among others, [[Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets football|Georgia Tech]] and [[Clemson Tigers football|Clemson]]) that has produced multiple Heisman Trophy winners. Auburn's [[Jordan\u2013Hare Stadium]] has a capacity of 87,451 ranking as the ninth-largest on-campus stadium in the NCAA {{as of|2006|September|lc=y}}.\n\n[[File:Jordan hare stadium.jpg|thumb|left|[[Jordan\u2013Hare Stadium]], 2005]]\nAuburn went 11\u20130 under Terry Bowden in 1993, but was on probation and not allowed to play in the SEC Championship game. Auburn completed the 2004 football season with a 13\u20130 record winning the [[Southeastern Conference|SEC]] championship, the school's first conference title since 1989 and the first outright title since 1987. The 2004 team was led by quarterback [[Jason Campbell]], running backs [[Carnell Williams]] and [[Ronnie Brown]], and cornerback [[Carlos Rogers (American football)|Carlos Rogers]], all subsequently drafted in the first round of the [[2005 NFL Draft]]. The team's new offensive coordinator, [[Al Borges]], led the team to use the [[west coast offense|west coast style offense]] which maximized the use of both star running backs. However, the Tigers were ranked behind two other undefeated teams, [[2004 USC Trojans football team|Southern California]] and [[2004 Oklahoma Sooners football team|Oklahoma]], that played in the [[Bowl Championship Series|BCS]] championship game.\n\nPrior to the 2008 season, Tony Franklin was hired as offensive coordinator to put Auburn into the spread offense. He was fired, however, following the sixth game of the season that ended in a loss to Vanderbilt. Tommy Tuberville then resigned as head coach after the season. On December 13, 2008, it was reported that [[Gene Chizik]] had been hired as Auburn's new head coach.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sportingnews.com/yourturn/viewtopic.php?t=496642 |title=Auburn hires Gene Chizik as football coach |access-date=December 13, 2008 |date=December 13, 2008 |publisher=Sporting News |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216160910/http://www.sportingnews.com/yourturn/viewtopic.php?t=496642 |archivedate=December 16, 2008 |url-status=dead}}</ref> Coach Gene Chizik then hired [[Gus Malzahn]] as the Tigers' new Offensive Coordinator.\n\n[[File:Rolling Toomers Corner Auburn University.jpg|thumb|left|The Auburn tradition of rolling Toomer's Corner after a sports win]]\nIn [[2010 Auburn Tigers football team|2010]], Auburn defeated [[2010 Oregon Ducks football team|Oregon]] 22\u201319 in the [[2011 BCS National Championship Game]] to secure the school's second national championship. The Tigers finished the season with a 14\u20130 record, including comeback wins over [[2010 Clemson Tigers football team|Clemson]], [[2010 South Carolina Gamecocks football team|South Carolina]], [[2010 Georgia Bulldogs football team|Georgia]], and [[2010 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|Alabama]]. The Tigers trailed the Tide 24\u20130 in Tuscaloosa, but managed a 28\u201327 comeback victory in the 75th edition of the [[Iron Bowl]]. Auburn would again defeat South Carolina 56\u201317 in the [[2010 SEC Championship Game]], claiming the school's eleventh conference championship. The Tigers were led by head coach Gene Chizik, offensive coordinator Gus Malzahn, quarterback and Heisman Trophy winner [[Cam Newton]], and defensive tackle and Lombardi Award winner [[Nick Fairley]]. In Malzahn's first season as head coach (2013), Auburn had two miraculous finishes in the final minute against Georgia and Alabama to win the SEC West. They went on to win the 2013 SEC Championship Game over Missouri and fell short in the [[2014 BCS National Championship Game]] to the [[Florida State Seminoles]] 34\u201331 in [[Pasadena, California]]. <!-- Keep this a summary.

Auburn's highest finish in the NCAA tournament was a tie for 2nd in 2002.<ref name=\"Golfweek\">{{cite web |url=http://auburntigers.cstv.com/sports/w-golf/spec-rel/101005aaa.html |title=Auburn Women's Golf named No. 3 Program since 1999 |publisher= Auburn University |access-date=May 30, 2009}}</ref>\n\nSince 1996, the team has been headed by Coach Kim Evans, a 1981 alumna, who has turned the program into one of the most competitive in the nation. Coach Evans has helped develop All-Americans, SEC Players of the Year as well as three SEC Freshman of the Year. She has led the Tigers to eight-straight NCAA appearances. She is by far the winningest Coach in Auburn Golf History, having over 1100 wins and winning six of Auburn's seven total SEC Titles. Evans was named National Coach of the Year in 2003 and has coached 8 individual All-Americans while at Auburn.\n\n===Track and field===\nThe Auburn women's track and field team won its first ever national title in 2006 at the NCAA Outdoor Track and Field Championships, scoring 57 points to win over the University of Southern California, which finished second with 38.5 points. Auburn posted All-American performances in nine events, including two individual national champions and three second-place finishers, and broke two school records during the four-day event.\n\nAuburn's men's team finished second at the 2003 NCAA Outdoor Championships and at the 1978, 1997 and 2003 NCAA Indoor Championships. The women's team finished 14th (2002, 2003) at the Outdoor Championships and seventh (2003) at the Indoor Championships.\n\n===Equestrian===\nAuburn's Equestrian team captured the 2006 national championship, the first equestrian national championship in school history. Senior Kelly Gottfried and junior Whitney Kimble posted team-high scores in their respective divisions as the Auburn equestrian team clinched the overall national championship at the 2006 Varsity Equestrian Championships at the EXPO/New Mexico State Fairgrounds in Albuquerque, NM.  In 2008, the Auburn Equestrian team captured the 2008 Hunt Seat National Championship. Over fences riders finished 12\u20131\u20131 overall for the week. Auburn has also consistently been highly ranked in the Women's Intercollegiate Equestrian National Coaches Poll as well. The Auburn Equestrian team most recently captured the 2016 national championship.\n\n==Traditions==\n{{Main|Auburn University traditions}}\nAuburn University has many traditions including a creed, an alma mater, a fight song, a battle cry, a mascot and several notable game-day traditions including an eagle flying over the football field.\n\n===Colors===\nThe official colors are:<ref name=\"AU Official Colors\">{{cite web |url=http://www.auburn.edu/template/colors.html|title=Auburn University Official Colors |access-date=March 5, 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"ocm.auburn.edu\"/>\n* Burnt Orange {{color box|#DD550C}}, [[RGB color model|RGB]] (221,85,12) (#DD550C), [[Pantone|PMS]] (158) \n* Navy Blue {{color box|#03244D}}, [[RGB color model|RGB]] (3,36,77) (#03244D), [[Pantone|PMS]] (289)\n\n===Fight song===\nAuburn University's [[fight song]], \"War Eagle\", was written in 1954 and 1955 by [[Robert Allen (song composer)|Robert Allen]] and [[Al Stillman]]. It was introduced at the beginning of the [[1955 Auburn Tigers football team|1955 football season]] and served as the official fight song ever since.\n\n===Hey Day===\nIn the 1950s and 60s Auburn designated a day on campus called \"Hey Day\" that encouraged students to interact with each other and simply say \"hey.\" Auburn reinstated this tradition in 1985 and has continued to evolve until this day. On Hey Days now, students are asked to put on name tags, handed out by student body leaders, and encouraged to say \"hey\" to whomever may pass them by during the day.<ref name=\"Auburn Traditions\">{{cite web|url=http://www.auburntigers.com/trads/01_auburn_tradition.html|title=Official Athletics Site of the Auburn Tigers \u2013 Traditions|publisher=AuburnTigers.com|access-date=May 29, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150503170727/http://www.auburntigers.com/trads/01_auburn_tradition.html|archive-date=May 3, 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n===Auburn's Eagles===\nAuburn has currently two eagles in their flight program for educational initiatives. One of these educational programs is known as the pregame flight program where the eagle handlers set an eagle free before Auburn takes the field at Jordan Hare Stadium. The eagle then proceeds to fly around the stadium and eventually land in the middle of the field.\n\nTiger, also known as War Eagle VI, was born in 1980 in captivity and given to Auburn University in 1986. Tiger's first flight before an Auburn Football game came against Wyoming in 2000. She retired after the Georgia game in 2006. Throughout Tiger's career, she flew many different flights and at many different venues including the 2002 Winter Olympics. Tiger died at the age of 34 in 2014.<ref name=\"Auburn Traditions\" />\n\nAuburn's first Flight program eagle is Nova, War Eagle VII. His first flight came before Auburn's game against Kentucky in 2004. He was born at the Montgomery zoo and given to Auburn a year later.\n\nSpirit is the only Bald Eagle Auburn has used for its pregame flight program. His first flight was in 2000. Spirit was found as a baby with an injured beak and nursed back to health before being given to Auburn for further rehabilitation in 1998. Unfortunately, Spirit's beak was damaged to the point that it is impossible for his release back into the wild.<ref name=\"Auburn Traditions\" />\n\n===Aubie the Tiger===\nAuburn's mascot, [[Aubie]] the tiger, has been around since 1959. He made his first appearance that year on the October 3 gameday football program versus [[Hardin\u2013Simmons Cowboys football|Hardin-Simmons College]]. Aubie was the creation of ''[[Birmingham Post-Herald]]'' artist Phil Neel and was the focal point of Auburn's football programs for 18 years. Auburn Football experienced good luck while Aubie remained on the cover, ending with a 23\u20132\u20131 home record and 63\u201316\u20132 overall record while he was on the program cover. Aubie the tiger is still currently Auburn's official mascot and has won the most National Mascot titles in the contest's history, with nine.<ref name=\"Aubie The Tiger\">{{cite web|url=http://studentaffairs.auburn.edu/2016/02/05/aubie-named-2016-mascot-national-champion/|title=Aubie Named 2016 Mascot National Champion |work= Auburn University Student Affairs}}</ref>\n\n===Auburn Football Tiger Walk===\nAuburn's Tiger Walk began in the 1960s, after fans would try to stop the players and get autographs before the games. It has since evolved into the spectacle, where fans line Donahue Drive to cheer on the team as they make their way from the athletic complex to the field. The highest point of the tiger walk came in 1989, when Auburn and Alabama played each other for the first time away from [[Legion Field]] in Birmingham. It is estimated that around 20,000 Auburn fans came out and lined the street to cheer on the team that day.<ref name=\"Auburn Traditions\" />\n\n===War Eagle chant theories===\nDuring Auburn's game against Georgia in 1892, a civil war veteran in the stands brought his pet eagle that he found on a battleground during the war. The eagle during the game flew away from the soldier and began circling the field in the air. As all this went on, Auburn began marching down the field to eventually score the game-winning touchdown. At the end of the game, the eagle dove into the ground and subsequently died; however, the Auburn faithful took the eagle as an omen of success and coined the phrase \"WAR EAGLE\" in turn.<ref name=\"Auburn Tigers\">{{cite web|url=http://www.al.com/auburnfootball/|title=Auburn football \u2013 Auburn Tigers Football NCAA News |work=al.com|access-date=May 29, 2015}}</ref>\n\nDuring a pep rally in 1913, a cheerleader said that the team would have to fight the whole game because the game meant \"war.\" At the same time of the rally, an eagle emblem fell on a student's military hat. When asked what it was, he yelled it was a \"War Eagle\".<ref name=\"Auburn Traditions\" />\n\nDuring a game against the Carlisle Indian Team in 1914, Auburn attempted to single out Carlisle's toughest player, Bald Eagle. To tire him out, they began running the ball his way during every play, by saying \"bald eagle\", while in formation. The crowd mistook this and began yelling \"War Eagle\", instead, leading to Auburn's player, Lucy Hairston, to yell \"War Eagle\" at the end of the game, after he scored the game-winning touchdown.<ref name=\"Auburn Traditions\" />\n\nAfter a battle, the Saxon warriors would yell \"War Eagle\", when the buzzards started to circle the battlefields. Some believe that Auburn coined its battle cry from this practice by the Saxons.<ref name=\"Auburn Traditions\" />\n\n===Toomer's Corner===\nThe tradition of rolling Toomer's Corner on Auburn's campus after winning home and big away games is thought to have originated in the 1950s. The tradition is thought to have spawned from when the owner of Toomer's Drugs, Sheldon Toomer, would toss his receipt paper into the trees to signal an Auburn road victory. This iconic tradition was ranked by USA Today as the \"Best Sports Tradition\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2257393-behind-the-auburn-tradition-of-rolling-toomers-corner |title=Behind the Auburn Tradition of Rolling Toomer's Corner|author=BR Studios|work=Bleacher Report|access-date=May 29, 2015}}<br />* {{cite web|url=http://www.theplainsman.com/article/2018/03/rolling-of-toomers-corner-oaks-voted-best-sports-tradition|title=Rolling of Toomer's Corner Oaks voted 'Best Sports Tradition'|author=The Plainsman|work=The Plainsman |access-date=March 9, 2018}}<br />* {{cite web|url=https://www.10best.com/awards/travel/best-sports-tradition/|title=10 Best Sports Traditions|author=USA Today|work=USA Today|access-date=March 9, 2018}}</ref> In November 2010, Harvey Updike Jr. poisoned the beloved trees at Toomer's Corner using 80DF after Auburn beat rival and Updike's team of choice 28\u201327.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.al.com/news/index.ssf/2015/11/harvey_updyke_poisoned_toomers.html|title=Harvey Updyke poisoned Toomer's Corner oaks 5 years ago|work=AL.com|access-date=October 30, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Selected organizations==\n===Media and publications===\n* ''[[The Auburn Plainsman]]'' \u2013 the university's student-run newspaper, has won 23 [[National Pacemaker Awards]] from the [[Associated Collegiate Press]] since 1966.
