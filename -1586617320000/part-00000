It was the 71st edition of the 24 Hour race, as organised by the automotive group, the [[Automobile Club de l'Ouest]] (ACO) since [[1923 24 Hours of Le Mans|1923]]. Unlike other events, it was not a part of any endurance motor racing championship.

The team won the race, two laps ahead of the sister Bentley of [[Mark Blundell]], [[David Brabham]] and [[Johnny Herbert]] in second place. It was Capello and Smith's first Le Mans victory and Kristensen's fifth. This was the sixth overall victory for Bentley, and their first since the [[1930 24 Hours of Le Mans|1930 edition]]. The overall podium was completed by [[Champion Racing]]'s [[Audi R8 (LMP)|Audi R8]] of [[JJ Lehto]], [[Emanuele Pirro]] and [[Stefan Johansson]], which won the Le Mans Prototype 900 (LMP900) category from [[Team Goh|Audi Sport Japan Team Goh]]'s entry driven by [[Seiji Ara]], [[Jan Magnussen]] and [[Marco Werner]].\n\nA No\u00ebl del Bello Racing [[Reynard Motorsport|Reynard]] 2KQ-LM driven by [[Jean-Luc Maury-Laribi\u00e8re]], Christophe Pillon and [[Didier Andr\u00e9]] won the Le Mans Prototype 675 (LMP675) class, 32 laps ahead of the second-placed RN Motorsport [[DBA4 03S]]-[[Gibson Technology|Zytek]] car of [[John Nielsen (racing driver)|John Nielsen]], [[Casper Elgaard]] and [[Hayanari Shimoda]].

After introductions, Usacha tells Usagi she has come to see how her brother works as a mascot in the hope of becoming one herself when she grows up. Usagi takes her with him as he trains Dressing Paf\u00e9. Dorothy comments on how unusually strict Usagi is being while his little sister is around, believing he is trying to impress her. When Usagi goes off to work and leaves Usacha on her own, Kuma decides to show her what her brother is really like and they secretly observe him. But this only strengthens Usacha's pride in her brother's hard work. Kuma then tricks Usagi into thinking he is Neko, causing Usacha to become upset at his behavior. Lala and the others then confront Kuma and ask him why he upset Usacha and Usagi, which he tells them was because he was jealous of Usagi for having a cute sister and always wanted one himself. Lala goes and talks with Usacha and after some explaining they decide to go to see Dressing Paf\u00e9's new live to show Usacha the results of her brother's hard work. After seeing how wonderful the show is, Usacha reconciles with her brother and vows to work really hard to become a mascot before leaving for home.

Lala climbs up to speak to the girl, who introduces herself as Fuwari Midorikaze, who has come to Japan at the request of a prince to participate in the Dream Theatre Grand Prix. Fuwari says she is up the tree to see if she can find Paprika Private Academy, which she will be attending while in Japan, so Lala offers to show her the way. Meanwhile Gloria receives a phone call from the mysterious prince concerning Fuwari and asks for her support in looking after her both at school and in Pripara, to which Gloria agrees. Lala tells the others about Fuwari and Mirei tells them that Fuwari will most likely be staying in the academy's high school dormitory, located behind the middle school. SoLaMi\u2661SMILE go to see Fuwari just as Gloria is explaining that she doesn't need to sleep on the floor of her room. Everyone is taken aback by Fuwari's open and carefree attitude, so much so that she manages to avoid receiving warning tickets from Mirei and having to wear a tie because she feels it is too constrictive like a collar on an animal. Fuwari is placed in the same class as Dorothy West, who is surprised to see her writing with chalk and slate. Fuwari explains that it's easier because her goat always eats paper, just as said goat begins to devour Dorothy's school work. Lala takes Fuwari to Pripara after school to show her round. However when attempting to register her ticket Meganee cannot find a brand for Fuwari, explaining that because the ticket was given to her by another person it does not register which brand she can use. Fuwari is therefore forced to wear the idol training outfit instead. While showing Fuwari around Pripara, Lala bumps into Kuma and, during the distraction, loses Fuwari who wanders off. The weather changes to rain and everyone takes shelter. Mirei and Sophy see Lala, and the girls manage to find Fuwari who is singing in the rain. Everyone including the animals are enchanted by Fuwari's singing and Lala suggests she try performing in a live. Fuwari appears unsure so Lala performs to show her how and Fuwari, awestruck by Lala's performance, decides to do her best to become an idol.

When Dorothy asks her what she's doing, Love acts defensive and dives into the pool to escape.

Dorothy and Reona decide to follow Love and see if she really has the tickets. On the way they notice Amamiya is also following Love, when Dorothy confronts him he says he heard Mirei talking about how upset she was about the Coord being stolen and wanted to find the thief in order to impress Mirei. He, like Dorothy, thought Love had the tickets. They follow love to a secluded park bench where they confront her but she refuses to hand over what she's holding. They are suddenly interrupted by Hibiki who is playing tennis on his private court opposite the bench. Hibiki asks what they're doing, but quickly changes the subject when Dorothy mentions they are looking for the Thieving Genius. He offers them to play tennis as he has heard of Love's skill.

Dorothy becoming frustrated, attempts to return one of Hibiki's serves but is cut across by Reona who had the same idea. The ball flies off and the gust of wind extracts the paper from Love's jacket. Dorothy seeing a chance grabs the paper thinking it is the Coord before Love can get it. However it turns out to be photos of a man in tennis gear. Love snatches the photos back and runs off in embarrassment. Dorothy, Reona and Amamiya go to apologise to Love who tells them the man is her tennis coach who she has a huge crush on but is planning on travelling abroad to play tennis.

A commotion at a waterfall draws their attention, someone is trying to swim up the waterfall. Love recognises the man as her coach and joins him in swimming up the waterfall.

Fuwari is placed in the same class as Dorothy West, who is surprised to see her writing with chalk and slate.

Sophy decides to continue alone, but it's not just her teammates feeling the strain, her fans begin to feel the pressure of constantly cheering for her.

Hibiki, still freaked out by Ajimi's behavior, knees her in the head, knocking her out, but Fuwari tells Hibiki to save her too, which she reluctantly does. As Ajimi comes round, Hibiki asks her why she went to all the trouble of trying to find her, which Ajimi says is because she really wants to be Hibiki's friend. Hibiki comes to understand true friendship and tries to get Fuwari and Ajimi out of the hole, with help from Toriko and Ham who show up. But the hole begins to close and the branch the rope is attached to breaks. Luckily Falulu grabs the rope but is too late to save the idols as the hole shrinks and forms a 'spiny bug'.

''Psychoanalytic Studies of Personality'', a 1952 collection of Fairbairn's papers previously published in various psychoanalytic journals, includes four papers that contain most of his innovative concepts. \n\nFairbairn's model is  classified as psychoanalytic model or theory because it shares the common assumption of all psychoanalytic models\u2014the belief that the fundamental source of human motivation originates in the unconscious\u2014as well as offering explanations of the origins and dynamics of transference, repetition compulsions, and resistance. His enormously ambitious goal was to replace Freudian [[metapsychology]] with his own. Fairbairn's vision of the human psyche was not based on the Freudian notion that the infant is overflowing with primitive drives needing to be tamed, but rather that the infant is seeking love and emotional attachment that can infuse him with the security he needs to explore the world, safe in the knowledge that he has parents ready to help him if he becomes overwhelmed in that exploration. Fairbairn's model offers a different theory of psychological development, a completely new vision of the structure and dynamics of the personality, a different source of the origins of psychopathology, and a different approach to the treatment of disordered individuals. Fairbairn's model also shifts the focus away from repression (of the Id's forbidden desires) and back to dissociation as humans' fundamental defense mechanism. \n\nGreenberg and Mitchell noted the basic changes promoted by Fairbairn.  \n<blockquote>\nIn a series of dense and fertile papers written during the early 1940's, W.R.D. Fairbairn developed a theoretical perspective which, along with Sullivan's \"interpersonal psychiatry\", provides the purest and clearest expression of the shift from the drive/structure model to the relational/structure model (Greenberg and Mitchell, 1983:151).<ref name=\":6\">{{Cite book|last=Greenberg and Mitchell|first=Jay  and Stephen|title=Object Relations in Psychoanalytic Theory|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1983|isbn=0-674-62975-2|location=|pages=151}}</ref></blockquote>\nThe psychoanalytic model Freud offers is a '''drive/structure model''': it proposes that human beings are born with innate, biological drives (e.g., sexual desire and aggression) contained in the unconscious Id. The infant's Id seeks discharge of its tensions regardless of the situation. When the discharging drive (hitting, biting, urinating, defecating) comes into contact with the demands and prohibitions of society, there is immediate conflict. A new structure must emerge from the Id of the growing infant to insure that its drives are expressed in a socially acceptable way. Thus the unconscious Id\u2014Freud's metaphor for the whole range and strength of biological drives\u2014is forced to develop contact with reality through the emergence of a second structure: the Ego. Thus the Ego has the task of mediating between the primitive Id and society. Later on in development (via the Oedipal Conflict), the child internalizes the values of his parents. These internalized values become the third internal structure, which is called the Super Ego. These three hypothetical ego structures\u2014Id, Ego, and Super Ego\u2014mature and grow with experience. Freud postulated that all psychological development is based on the Id seeking satisfaction, the Ego curbing the Id's most extreme demands, and the Super Ego pressing the Ego to make morally correct choices. \n\nIn contrast, Fairbairn's is a '''relational/structure model''' in its assumption that the human psyche develops its structure from actual human experience, not from pressure from the Id, whose existence Fairbairn rejects. Instead, Fairbairn proposes that the human psyche develops structures based on actual interpersonal events. A child's growing and maturing internal ego structures can be understood as packages of memories that coalesce and form internal representations of the parents, of the child himself, and of the child's relationship to his parents. For Fairburn, the unconscious develops as a consequence of empathic failures of the parents that are too disruptive for the child's underdeveloped central ego to tolerate. Awareness of these failures would interfere with the child's absolute dependency on his parents, and knowledge of them would destroy the necessary illusion that he is loved and cherished. In families where punishment is frequent and severe, parental failures can be catastrophic to the child's developing sense of self. That is, the child can be so overwhelmed by parental aggression that it faces the loss of its sense of self, as described by Bromberg:     <blockquote>\nPsychological trauma occurs in situations, explicitly or implicitly interpersonal, in which self-invalidation (sometimes self-annihilation) cannot be escaped from or prevented, and from which there is no hope of protection, relief, or soothing. If the experience is either prolonged, [sic] assaultively violent, or if self-development is weak or immature, then the level of affective arousal is too great for the event to be experienced self-reflectively and given meaning through cognitive processing. \u2026 At its extreme, the subjective experience is that of a chaotic and terrifying flooding of affect that threatens to overwhelm sanity and psychological survival (Bromberg, 1998, 12).<ref>{{Cite book|last=Bromberg|first=Philip|title=Standing in The Spaces: Essays on Clinical Process, Trauma and Dissociation|publisher=Psychology Press|year=1998|isbn=0-88163-356-9|location=|pages=12}}</ref>     \n</blockquote>\nOver time, these dissociated events, including those in which the child's sense of self was endangered, become ego structures in the individual's internal world. (See the following section on splitting of the ego for a detailed explanation of this process.) Thus the human psyche acquires structure from the tensions of split-off traumas so toxic they remain unavailable to the individual's central ego. Therefore, the unconscious is not a biological inheritance of humankind but a development of specific parental failures and interpersonal traumas that were dissociated because they were too disruptive to remember.\n\n===='Schizoid Factors in the Personality' (1940)====\n\nIn his first paper, Fairbairn observed that many of his patients seemed \"schizoid\", which he defined as having '''splits in their ego structure''' directly resulting from dissociated memories in their central ego. That is, because the conscious ego does not know about the dissociated memories that are held in the unconscious, the central ego has had parts of it split off. \n\nHis schizoid patients had three defining characteristics:<blockquote>\n\u2026 (1) an attitude of omnipotence, (2) an attitude of isolation and detachment and, (3) a preoccupation with inner reality.\u2026 So as far as the preoccupation with inner reality is concerned, this is undoubtedly the most important of all schizoid characteristics; and it is not the less present whether inner reality be substituted for outer reality, identified with outer reality, or superimposed upon outer reality (Fairbairn, 1952, p:6-7).<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|last=Fairbairn|first=William Ronald Dodds|title=Psychoanalytic Studies of the Personality|publisher=Routledge & Kegan Paul|year=1952|isbn=0-7100-1361-2|location=London|pages=}}</ref></blockquote>\nThe more frequently a child encounters intolerable trauma, the larger the number of memories of actual lived experiences that are split off and unavailable to the conscious \"central ego\". The schizoid style of relating (or more accurately, non-relating) to others originates from repeated rejections of the child's legitimate need for love and emotional support during his developmental years. The schizoid child was raised by a mother who was unable to relate to her child with tender, loving emotions, and as a direct consequence of this rejection, the child withdraws into his inner world, which, though safer, is ultimately less satisfying. Fairbairn spells this out starkly:\n<blockquote>\nRegressive reinstatement of the early oral attitude (the earliest form of dependency) would appear to be most readily brought about by a situation of emotional frustration in which the child comes to feel (a) that he is not really loved for himself as a person by his mother, and (b) that his own love for his mother is not really valued and accepted by her. This is a highly traumatic situation, giving rise to a further situation characterized as follows: (a) the child comes to regard his mother as a Bad Object in so far as she does not seem to love him, (b) The child comes to regard outward expressions of his own love as bad, with the result that ... he tends to retain his love inside of himself. (c) The child comes to feel that love relationships with external objects in general are bad, or at least precarious (Fairbairn, 1952:17-18).<ref name=\":2\" /> \n</blockquote>\nLack of love in a young child's life is so traumatic and disruptive to his attachment that these parental failures force him to use the dissociative defense, causing splits in his ego. \n\nTypically, Fairbairn returned again and again to topics that he had discussed in his early papers as he was gradually expanding his observations while creating a coherent model. For example, in a quote from his 1941 paper on the schizoid personality style, Fairbairn observes that the unloved child feels his love is destructive because his parents do not value or accept it, and because they do not return his love. Thus the child blames himself for not being lovable, which deflects the blame from his unloving parents on to himself. He continues the illusion that he has loving parents that reject him for a good reason, i.e., that he and his love are toxic. This theme will come up again in the 1943 paper when Fairbairn described \"The Moral Defense Against Bad Objects\" a cognitive defense in which the child blames himself for the parental failures. In the next quote, Fairbairn uses the Freudian concept of 'libido', which was defined as the mix of sex and aggression in the Id. Fairbairn was forced to use the preexisting language of psychoanalysis, however he took the word \"libido\" and changed it to mean a child's love for his parents or love of other external objects:<blockquote>\nIt is the great tragedy of the schizoid individual that his love seems to destroy: and it is because his love seems so destructive that he experiences such difficulty in directing libido toward objects in outer reality. He becomes afraid to love: and therefore he erects barriers between his objects and himself. He tends to both keep his objects at a distance and to make himself remote from them. He rejects his objects: and at the same time he withdraws libido from them. This withdrawal of libido may be carried to all lengths. It may be carried to a point at which all emotional and physical contacts with other persons are renounced; and it may even go so far that all libidinal links with outer reality are surrendered, all interest in the world around fades and everything becomes meaningless. In proportion as libido is withdrawn from outer objects it is directed toward internalized objects: and in proportion as this happens the person becomes introverted (Fairbairn 1952, p.50)<ref name=\":2\" />.    \n</blockquote>\nSimply put, the unloved child who has directed his love toward his parents, only to be rebuffed, gives up hope that he will ever be loved, and as a consequence holds his love inside. He gives up on human relationships, focusing instead on his inner world and its fantasies and dreams of success.\n\n===='A Revised Psychopathology of the Psychoses and Psychoneuroses  (1941)'====\nFairbairn was gradually forming  his model in these first papers. He  challenged Freud's drive theory directly in this second paper by  stating \"Nevertheless, it would appear as if the point had now been reached at which, in the interest of progress, the classical libido theory would have to be transformed into ''a theory of development based essentially upon object-relationships,'' Fairbairn (1952,p,31).<ref name=\":2\" />  Unfortunately, the shift in focus from drive theory to object relations theory was too great for the psychoanalytic community to accept, because Freud's entire model was based on the existence and activity of libidinal drives. All of psychoanalysis was Freudian, there were no other options, and yet Fairbairn asked his colleagues to choose between his model and Freud's. They overwhelming chose Freud. From this point on, his model was seen as an interesting intellectual exercise, rather than as a viable analytic model that would, over time, become one of the foundational models of  \"Relational Psychoanalysis\" of simply \"Relationality\"<ref>{{Cite book|last=Mitchell|first=Stephen|title=Relationality: From Attachment to Intersubjectivity|publisher=The Analytic Press|year=2000|isbn=0-88163-322-4|location=|pages=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Mitchell, Stephen & Aron, Lewis|first=|title=Relational Psychoanalysis: The Emergence of a Tradition|publisher=The Analytic Press|year=1999|isbn=0-88163-270-8|location=|pages=}}</ref>.\nFairbairn proposed an outline of a developmental model in this chapter as well. He noted that human development was characterized by a gradual differentiation (separation both physically and psychologically) from the parent because of the emergence  of a mature, reality based, central ego in the young adult. This allows the young adult to begin life on his own, find a partner and produce the next generation.<blockquote>The development of object-relationships is essentially a process whereby infantile dependence upon the object gradually gives place to mature dependence upon the object. The process of development is characterized (a) by the gradual abandonment of an original object relationship based on primary identification, and (b) the gradual adoption of an object-relationship based upon differentiation of the object (Fairbairn, 1952, p.34)<ref name=\":2\" /> </blockquote>\nThus, the developmental process requires that the individual no longer sees himself as part of his mother, but rather as an independent, fully functioning person. Unfortunately, many children are not supported and loved sufficiently to go through the \"transitional\" stage easily. They do not feel  secure and cannot engage in age appropriate activity with their peers. Instead, they are looking backwards toward their mother for more support, rather than toward the outside world of other children and healthy play. Fairbairn noted this in one of his most famous quotes:<blockquote>\nThe greatest need of a child is to obtain conclusive assurance (a) that he is genuinely loved as a person by his parents, and (b) that his parents genuinely accept his love. It is only in so far as such assurance is forthcoming in a form sufficiently convincing to enable him to depend safely upon his real objects (parents) that he is able to gradually renounce infantile dependence without misgiving. In the absence of such assurance his relationships to his objects is fraught with too much anxiety over separation to enable him to renounce the attitude of infantile dependence: for such a renunciation would be equivalent in his eyes to forfeiting all hope of ever obtaining the satisfaction of his unsatisfied emotional needs. '''Frustration of his desire to be loved as a person, and frustration of his desire to have his love accepted, is the greatest trauma that a child can experience''' (Fairbairn, 1952, p.39-40)<ref name=\":2\" /> </blockquote>\nThus, the dependent child cannot mature and go on to the next developmental step as he is fearful of increased separation from his parents without being sure of their love and support.  Their support and encouragement  gives him enough courage to let them go, and establish new relationships with peers and future partners. The child who is unsure of his parents' love remains emotionally underdeveloped, and often remains at home, trying to obtain the love that was not forthcoming in his developmental history (Celani, 2005)<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite book|last=Celani|first=David|title=Leaving Home|publisher=Columbia Universities Press|year=2005|isbn=978-0-231-13477-4|location=New York|pages=}}</ref>.  \n\nThe unloved child attempts to comfort himself by becoming increasingly \"schizoid\". That is, he turns away from the harsh world of his family and towards his internalized memories of others, including his parents, for reassurance that they are with him and available at all times. Unfortunately, most of his internalized memories are negative (see the relationship between the antilibidinal ego ad he rejecting object in the splitting section). Despite the negativity, the endless struggle between these internalized split off part self and part object provides the comfort of the known and familiar. Clearly, this is a half measure, but it is the best that the ignored or rejected child can do under the circumstances, as he cannot change his parents or force them to love him.  Secondly,  the rejected child comforts himself with \"substitutive satisfactions\"  which Fairbairn assumed were forms of immature sexuality. Today, the unloved, schizoid child has only to turn to the internet for an endless number of fantasy based videos that compensate him for his lack of love, lack of power and desire for revenge that temporarily lessen his pain. Fairbairn was clear about this regressive return to the inner world because of the harshness of the external world: \"Fundamentally, these substitutive satisfactions ...all represent ''relationships with internalized objects, to which the individual is compelled to turn in default of satisfactory relationships with objects in the outer world\"(Italics in the original) Fairbairn, 1952, p.40)''<ref name=\":2\" />. This observation of Fairbairn's  has come true for millions of alienated and unloved children who spend hour upon hour avoiding interactions with external people while immersed in their video fantasy world. This is the most satisfaction that they can get from their lives, as their relationships with their parents are so frustrating. \n\nFairbairn also discussed the difficulties in separating from unloving parents in this 1941 paper. He recognized that the lack of early support left the child with very few emotional resources to sustain himself when he left home and faced the world alone. He called the stage between \"infantile dependence\" and \"mature interdependence' the stage of \"Transition\".<blockquote>The great conflict of the transition stage may now be formulated as a conflict between a progressive urge to surrender the infantile attitude of identification with the object and a regressive urge to maintain that attitude. During this period, accordingly, the behavior of the individual is characterized both by desperate endeavors on his part to separate from the object and desperate endeavors to achieve reunion with the object-desperate attempts \"to escape from prison' and desperate attempts \"to return home\" (Fairbairn, 1952, p.43).<ref name=\":2\" /></blockquote>The less the child has been supported in his early years, the less chance he/she has of a successful transition into adulthood. The huge number of \"adult\" aged individual who either live at home with their ageing parents, or others who live separately, but fixated in an adolescent time warp is enormous. In either case, they have been unable to enter mature relationships because they are still seeking the support and encouragement that they missed out on in childhood <ref name=\":5\" />.   \n\n===='The Repression and the Return of Bad Objects (1943)' ====\nFairbairn's third theoretical paper further alienated those few members of the analytic community who found his work acceptable as he had the temerity to once again urge the replacement of drive theory with his object relations theory.<blockquote>Amongst the conclusions formulated in the above mentioned paper (his 1941 paper) two of the most far reaching are the following:(1) that libidinal\"aims\" are of secondary importance in comparison with object-relationships and (2) that a relationship with the object, and not gratification of the impulse, is the ultimate aim of libidinal striving (Fairbairn, 1952, p.60)<ref name=\":2\" />  </blockquote>This is '''not''' what the analytic community was looking for in 1943, as Fairbairn reduced Freud's concept of Libido to a secondary position as compared to his vision of the child's motivation which was to search for a good object and establish a loving  relationship with another human being. To make matters much worse, Fairbairn then formally re-defined the human unconscious, not as a container of biological drives, but rather compendium of  memories of interpersonal events that were too destructive to the child's needed attachment to his parents for his developing ego to accept. Fairbairn's challenge to Freud was not much of a problem for the analytic community despite the fact that Fairbairn's unconscious was so different from the \"standard\" Freudian view, simply because his model was politely ignored until the publication of Greenberg and Mitchell's book in 1983,<ref name=\":6\" />. This alerted the younger members of the psychoanalytic community to a new model of psychoanalysis, and the renewed interest provoked numerous publications.  <blockquote>I now venture to formulate the view that what are primarily repressed are neither intolerably guilty impulses nor intolerably unpleasant memories, but intolerably bad internalized objects. If memories are repressed, accordingly, this is only because the objects involved in such memories are identified with bad internalized objects (Fairbairn, 1952,p.62)<ref name=\":2\" />  </blockquote>Fairbairn was ahead of himself in this quote because  he had not yet defined a \"'''bad object'''\", which is a parent or guardian that the child looks to for love,help, guidance, and support, and who fails the child again and again. Note that Fairbairn uses the word repressed rather than dissociated in this quote. Repression is used to describe the psychological defense of holding of material in the unconscious that is already present. Dissociation describes the psychological act of actively \"forgetting\" a overwhelmingly traumatic event in the external world  and simultaneously forcing it into in the unconscious. Once there,  it is held out of awareness by repression. In this short quote Fairbairn dismisses Freud's notion of biological forces that were claimed to be the fundamental motivator of humankind and replaced them with the assumption that the human unconscious was developed from the dissociation of traumatic rejections during  which the child needs were ignored or dismissed.  Once in the unconscious, they resonate throughout the individuals life. Then Fairbairn went on to clearly define these split off memories in the unconscious as the basic source of human psychopathology.  <blockquote>Whether any given individual becomes delinquent, psychoneurotic, psychotic or simply \"normal\" would appear to depend in the main upon the operation of three factors: (1) the extent to which bad objects have been installed in the unconscious and the degree of badness by which they are characterized, (2) the extent to which the ego is identified with internalized bad objects, and (3) the nature and strength of the defenses which protect the ego from these objects (Fairbairn, 1952, p.65)<ref name=\":2\" /> .</blockquote>The child who is so unfortunate to be born in a family where the parents are absent, indifferent or abusive is going to experience and internalize a huge number of bad object interactions. These dissociated memories form large and powerful inner structures that will influence his view of himself and his perception of external reality. The next two factors can exacerbate or  mitigate the impact of these internalizations. For instance a boy who sees his father beat his mother may identify with this behavior and then re-enact this pattern in his adulthood. Conversely a female child might identify with her mother and internalize the role of a victim of abuse. The third factor is also significant as the highly defended individual will remember little or nothing of the traumas he/she experienced in childhood and will have a greater probability of re-enacting one role or the other because they have no ability to \"mentalize\", or think about and  process the traumatic event so as to understand what happened to them when they were a defenseless child. Instead, the internalized patterns will re-emerge and be acted out with the next generation. This is called the \"intergenerational transmission of trauma\".                          \n\nFairbairn noticed that children whom had been removed from their families because of extreme neglect or abuse (this was in 1940's Scotland) made endless excuses for their parents and assumed that they were responsible for the treatment that they were receiving. That is, their parents were punishing them because they were dirty, disobedient, or lazy. The child assumed that he was the cause of the parent's hostile behavior toward them. Fairbairn called this the \"Moral Defense Against Bad Objects\" Once again, the child is desperate to support the illusion that he is living within a  loving family. parents.         <blockquote>It become obvious, therefore, that the child would rather be bad himself than have bad objects: and accordingly we have some justification for surmising that  one of his motives in becoming bad is to make his objects \"good'. In becoming bad he is really taking upon himself the burden of badness which appears to reside in his objects. By this means he seeks to purge them of his badness: and in proportion as he succeeds in doing so,he is rewarded by that sense of security which an environment of good objects so characteristically confers....Outer security is thus purchased at the price of inner insecurity (Fairbairn, 1952, p.65)<ref name=\":2\" />.        </blockquote>This defense is a cognitive defense in that the child is explaining to himself why he is being punished or neglected. By saying it is his fault, he absolves his parents and gives them a \"good\" reason for treating him badly. But, as Fairbairn notes, it continues the pattern of using defenses to continue to create the illusion of a loving family, and it distorts reality. The child prefers to believe that he has a \"moral\" defect, such as laziness, disrespect, or dirty, all of which are potentially correctable, than see that his parents are emotionally bankrupt. Worse, the defensive self blame erodes what little self worth the child may have developed. This defense is really a precursor to the splitting defense that Fairbairn described in his next paper (1944). It is a primitive form of splitting in that he parental objects are \"all good\", and the child himself is \"all bad\". Fairbairn never went back to his earlier concepts and corrected them or explained his evolving thought that motivated him to change his theory over time.                \n\nIn the following section of this paper,Fairbairn continued his discussion of the different aspects of the child's dependency on his objects. Once again, these concepts would have been more appropriate in his 1941 paper where he first discussed the issue of dependency. However, the reader is given an opportunity to actually see how a major innovator of a psychoanalytic theory gradually created a model. His mind was not linear, and many topics came to mind again and again, dependency being the most frequent topic.Here, he observes the intense need of the child for his parents and the child's inability to reject them, regardless of how they treated him.        <blockquote>The child not only internalizes his bad objects because they force themselves upon him and he seeks to control them, but also,and above all, because he ''needs'' them. If a child's parents are bad objects, he cannot eject them, even if they do not force themselves upon him: for he cannot do without them. '''Even if they neglect him, he cannot reject them: for if they neglect him, his need for them is increased''' (Fairbairn, 1952,p.67)<ref name=\":2\" />.        </blockquote>Fairbairn made this revolutionary observation and at the time it went unnoticed. The '''neglected child needs the parent more, rather than less''' because the individual's earlier needs were never fulfilled, and they do not suddenly disappear or resolve themselves. This observation seems counter-intuitive when seen from an adult perspective, because a mature individual would leave in a minute.  However, the reality of many  young adults from neglectful families is that they are pressured to remain with their abusive parents from their own unmet needs. They may have unmet needs from age 4, 5,6,7,8 (and so on) that were  never met, so as a young adult this individual has '''no possibility whatsoever of separating''' from his neglectful parents and beginning a life of his own. This was one of Fairbairn's great insights which can be seen in virtually all patients.                \n\nFairbairn then took up new topics in he same paper- which is one of his two greatest (the second being his 1944 paper which will be described in the next section). The two topics were his theory of treatment and his view of resistance. Neither actually belongs in this paper- his 1958 paper on treatment would have been the better site, but once again, his mind was not linear. First, Fairbairn throws out a comment that has far ranging implications in the treatment process.                 <blockquote>Nevertheless, I cannot help feeling that such results must be attributed, in part at least, to the fact that in the transference situation the patient is provided in reality with an unwontedly good object, and is thereby placed in a position to risk a release of his internalized bad objects from the unconscious and so to provide conditions for the libidinal cathexis of these objects to be dissolved-albeit he is also under a temptation to exploit a \"good\" relationship  with he analyst as a defense against taking this risk (Fairbairn, 1952, p.69) .<ref name=\":2\" />                  </blockquote>Fairbairn  identifies one of he mutaive factors in psychotherapy as the \"good relationship\" between the therapist patient as one that might provoke a derepression of the memories of abuse and neglect held in the unconscious. He sees the relationship between patient and therapist as providing the patient with enough confidence and support to allow him to \"remember\" or more accurately, \"de-repress\" memories of neglect and abuse from his childhood. He also uses the word \"libidinal cathexis\" in his quote which is a holdover from the Freudian model. It means emotional investment of libidinal energy in the other person, which when translated into Fairbairn's terminology, means emotional attachment. Thus, a relationship with a new, good object can loosen up the attachment to internalized bad object, as the good object offers the patient an alternative attachment. In reality, this process seldom happens until treatment is well underway and the therapist is specifically aiming to unearth this type of material.  Most frequently, the patient clings to his illusions of a loving and supportive family as well as to the illusion that he is somehow defective and deserving of neglect or abuse.\n\nThe paper's title \"Repression and the Return of Bad Objects\" suggests the Fairbairn was going to address the reemergence of bad objects, which he did in a very brief comment on one of the fundamental sources of '''Resistance.''' Resistance describes the patient's attempts to remain the same and fight against the therapist's interventions during the process of psychotherapy, despite their conscious desire to change. Fairbairn's model is extremely coherent, and given that the source of psychopathology is the internalization of bad objects because they were intolerable to accept, resistance comes from the patient's fear of acknowledging and accepting what happened to him in childhood despite the fact that these events occurred decades ago. This is true even if the parents are long deceased, because for the patient to accept what they did to him/her as a child will, in most cases, destroy all his illusions about them as parents and the \"goodness\" of his childhood. It also leaves the individual without a personal history as he has to discard all his fantasies of being a member of a family. \n\nFairbairn's quote is graphic and too the point.<blockquote>There is little doubt in my mind that, in conjunction with another factor to be mentioned later, the deepest source of resistance is fear of the release of bad objects from the unconscious: for, when such bad objects are released the world around the patient becomes peopled with devils which are too terrifying for him to face...at the same time there is now little doubt in my mind that the release of bad objects from the unconscious is one of he chief aims which the psychotherapist should set himself out to achieve (Fairbairn, 1952, p.69)<ref name=\":2\" /> .</blockquote>Fairbairn's comment on the difficulty for patients to actual reexamine and tolerate the events that they had already suffered through is absolutely correct. He was both a philosopher and and an advanced  divinity student before becoming a physician and psychoanalyst and often his language involves devils and angels, as it does in this quote. Later on the next page he ends his comment on resistance with the statement: \"It becomes evident, accordingly, that the psychotherapist is the true successor to the exorcist, and that he is concerned, not only with \"the forgiveness of sins\", but also with \"the casting out of devils\"\" (Fairbairn, 1952, p.70).<ref name=\":2\" /> \n\n=== The splitting of the ego ===\n{{Main|Splitting (psychology)}}\nFairbairn recognized that  children are  totally and absolutely dependent on their parents. Because of this dependency they cannot tolerate \"knowing\" that their parents are indifferent, abandoning, and perhaps even abusive. They solve the problem of \"knowing\" about their parents' rejection of them by dissociating memories of interactions that were intolerable to accept. The defense of dissociation was seen as an extreme defense that was only used  in life-threatening situations. Fairbairn had worked in an orphanage associated with the University of Edinburgh <ref>{{Cite book|title=Fairbairn's journey into the interior|last=Sutherland, John Derg, 1905- ...|date=1999|publisher=Free Association Books|isbn=1-85343-059-5|oclc=470458410}}</ref>as one of his part-time appointments and his experiences with children separated from their families alerted him to the reality that the child's extreme dependency on their parents makes any abandonment a major trauma. The powerful defense called '''dissociation''' was needed to erase the event from their consciousness. The memory of the rejecting parent, along with the  memory of the child's response to that parent, are forced into the unconscious and held there by repression. This allows the child to continue loving a parent that he sees as completely supportive. Once dissociated, these memories of the child in relationship to the parent become internal ego structures over time. In families where rejection is commonplace, the thousands upon thousands of dissociated memories accrue and become powerful sub-personalities. Memories of the angry, annoyed, rejecting or indifferent parent must be dissociated, for if the child were to \"see\" this reality it would destroy his dependency relationship on the parent and he would face an abandonment crisis. In addition to the memories of the rejecting parent (The '''Rejecting Object''' in Fairbairn's model) the child must also dissociate memories of himself during the interpersonally rejecting interactions. Fairbairn called the ego structure that develops from the dissociated memories of  the child's  self  as he reacted to the parent's rejection of him and his legitimate needs, the '''Antilibidinal Ego'''. These memories of the self as fearful, defeated, shamed and humiliated cannot be tolerated consciously. The antagonistic and bickering  relationship between the Antilibidinal Ego and the internalized Rejecting Object that are held in the inner world continues unabated in dialogues between them, as described by Ogden: \n\n\"Neither the rejecting object nor the internal saboteur (the antilibidinal ego) is willing or able to think about, much less relinquish, that tie. In fact, there is no desire on the part of either to change anything about their mutual dependence. The power of that bond is impossible to overestimate. The rejecting object and the internal saboteur are determined to nurse their feelings of having been deeply wronged, cheated, humiliated, betrayed, exploited, treated unfairly, discriminated against, and so on. The mistreatment at the hands of the other is felt to be unforgivable. An apology is forever expected by each, but never offered by either\" (Odgen,2018)<ref>{{Citation|last=Ogden|first=Thomas H.|chapter=Why read Fairbairn? *|date=2018-03-08|pages=131\u2013146|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-429-47453-8|doi=10.4324/9780429474538-12|title=Fairbairn and the Object Relations Tradition}}</ref>  \n\nWithin the child's inner world (his unconscious) '''the Antilibidinal Ego relates only to the \"Rejecting Object\",''' and this pair of self and object structures are unknown to the conscious '''Central Ego''' that is in contact with the acceptable aspects of the parent (the '''Ideal Object''') and with external reality.  In extremely negative families there are so few supportive, positive interactions with the parents that the child is forced, by necessity to create hope for himself by developing a second set of views of himself in relationship to his parent. In Fairbairn's model the need of the child for a positive parent is so intense that he creates a \"good\" parent  for himself. That is, without a loving parent the child's bond and attachment to his parent would be broken, and he would experience a sense of complete abandonment. The child avoids this crisis by creating a second vision of the parent, one that is based on idealization and fantasy which (mis)perceives the parent as filled with the potential of love. This second vision of the parent is built out of the occasional positive or tender interaction that he has experienced with his mostly rejecting parents.  This fantasy-based parent (which becomes an ego structure) was called the '''Exciting Object''' by Fairbairn, and the child's self that relates to it was called the '''Libidinal Ego''' (or Self).  The attachment between the Antilibidinal Ego and the Rejecting Object is intense as they struggle to convince each other of their claims against the other. Similarly the attachment between the intensely needy Libidinal Ego and the Exciting Object is equally powerful. The combination of the attachments of these  two mostly unconscious selves to these part objects constitutes what Fairbairn defined as an attachment to the '''Bad Object'''.  The Bad Object has two facets: the Antilibidinal Ego argues with and complains about its mistreatment to the Rejecting Object in an attempt to reform it, while the Libidinal Ego seeks ways to find out how to please the Exciting Object which promises it love which is always out of reach. \n\nThese two unconscious pairs: \n* The '''Antilibidinal Ego''' that relates to the '''Rejecting Object''', and \n* the '''Libidinal Ego''' that relates only to the '''Exciting Object''' \nare unknown to each other and to the Central Ego. '''Splitting''' allows the child to hate the rejecting object with a feral rage, and to love the Exciting Object with all its heart. Splitting is a defense that prevents the integration of Good and Bad Object memories into a single whole Object. Thus, the individual  never develops \"object constancy\" which is the ability to see a person's goodness, even when they are being rejected or frustrated by that person. Thus, a very important developmental milestone is not achieved, and the individual functions at an earlier stage of childhood development, often throughout life. Splitting causes the individual to respond to external objects '''as if they were two different people.''' When the individual is frustrated they see the object as \"all bad\" and devoid of any goodness. Conversely, when they are dominated by their  Libidinal Ego structure they see the object as \"all good\". Developmentally, this is equivalent to the child who screams at her mother in a rage, and minutes later says \"I love you, Mommy\". There is no memory of the other ego state. Equally importantly, powerful, emotion filled memories are dissociated, which impoverishes and weakens the Central Ego, which is unaware of significant realities from its developmental history.<ref>{{Cite book|url=isbn 978-0-231-14907-5|title=Fairbairn's Object Relations Theory in the Clinical Setting Columbia University Press|last=Celani|first=David|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2010|isbn=978-3-11-053768-0|location=|pages=|oclc=1007218368}}</ref>\n\n'''Fairbairn's Structural Model'''\n\nEmotional deprivation, and the resulting fear of abandonment, leads to splitting of the ego, and the split ego eventuates into Fairbairn's Structural Theory. As just described, the psyche is split into three pairs of selves that relate to three separate objects:\n* The Central Ego relates to the Ideal Object\n* The Antilibidinal Ego relates to the Rejecting Object\n* The Libidinal Ego relates to the Exciting Object\n\nThe three pairs of structures relate only to each other and are '''unaware''' of the other two pairs. In effect, this structural model is the beginning stage of a multiple personality, however '''it never develops beyond this steady state.''' As described, the Central Ego develops in relationship to the supportive and nurturing parent(s), the Ideal Object(s). The strength and size of the Central Ego varies from child to child according to how many positive, ego enhancing activities and interpersonal events they have experienced during their development. Fairbairn's model assumes that actual events in reality summate in both the conscious Central Ego and in the unconscious structures as well. Thus large numbers of loving, non-intrusive, and emotionally supportive interactions with the parent(s) enhance the child's Central Ego through daily positive relating. As the child develops over time his trust in others allows him to interact with new adults and children and is able to develop new skills, as well as enlarge a more complex view of himself through interactions with others who see aspects of himself that his parents have not discovered. \n\nIn less favorable developmental conditions, where support, nurturance and reassurance is scarce or absent, the child's Central Ego does not develop a richer and more rounded sense of self, rather the  development of his Central Ego is thwarted rather than enhanced. At the same time, his many negative experiences are being dissociated and repressed, and his Central Ego has lost sight of the many important (but negative) events in his childhood, which are banished (and remain) in his unconscious structures.  The ratio of conscious to unconscious structures shifts away from conscious relationships with external objects to the child's powerful and richly populated unconscious, with the endless bickering between the Antilibidinal Ego and the Rejecting Object, and the unrealistic fantasy world of the Libidinal Ego seeking the key to the love that it assumes  (incorrectly) is stored in their parent (the Exciting Object''')'''. This powerful unconscious influences the weakened Central Ego and is the source of both transference and repetition compulsions.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|title=Fairbairn's Object Relations Theory In the Clinical Setting|last=Celani|first=David|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0-231-14907-5|location=New York|pages=51\u201371}}</ref> \n\n'''Transference, Resistance and Repetition Compulsions'''\n\nWhen any individual superimposes or projects his inner structures on an external object (for instance, his Rejecting Object) then he is going to misperceive that individual's intentions and behavior, and relate to him in a passive-aggressive and hostile manner. Thus projection of the inner structures onto external objects becomes the source of transference.  This happens when the unconscious structures are powerful and the Central Ego is weakened and has poor contact with external objects.<br />\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.columbia.edu/~rr322/FAIRBAIRN.html 'Fairbairn's Structural Model'], Richard L.

''Psychoanalytic Studies of Personality'', a 1952 collection of Fairbairn's papers previously published in various psychoanalytic journals, includes four papers that contain most of his innovative concepts. \n\nAlthough Fairbairn's model is still classified as psychoanalytic because it shares the common assumption of all psychoanalytic models\u2014the belief that the fundamental source of human motivation originates in the unconscious\u2014as well as offering explanations of the source of transference, repetition compulsions, and resistance, his enormously ambitious goal was to replace Freudian [[metapsychology]] with his own. Fairbairn's vision of the human psyche was not based on the Freudian notion that the infant is overflowing with primitive drives needing to be tamed, but rather that the infant is seeking love and emotional attachment that can infuse him with the security he needs to explore the world, safe in the knowledge that he has parents ready to help him if he becomes overwhelmed in that exploration. Fairbairn's model offers a different theory of psychological development, a completely new vision of the structure and dynamics of the personality, a different source of the origins of psychopathology, and a different approach to the treatment of disordered individuals. Fairbairn's model also shifts the focus away from repression (of the Id's forbidden desires) and back to dissociation as humans' fundamental defense mechanism. \n\nGreenberg and Mitchell noted the basic changes promoted by Fairbairn.  \n<blockquote>\nIn a series of dense and fertile papers written during the early 1940's, W.R.D. Fairbairn developed a theoretical perspective which, along with Sullivan's \"interpersonal psychiatry\", provides the purest and clearest expression of the shift from the drive/structure model to the relational/structure model (Greenberg and Mitchell, 1983:151).<ref>{{Cite book|last=Greenberg and Mitchell|first=Jay  and Stephen|title=Object Relations in Psychoanalytic Theory|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1983|isbn=0-674-62975-2|location=|pages=151}}</ref></blockquote>\nThe psychoanalytic model Freud offers is a '''drive/structure model''': it proposes that human beings are born with innate, biological drives (e.g., sexual desire and aggression) contained in the unconscious Id. The infant's Id seeks discharge of its tensions regardless of the situation. When the discharging drive (hitting, biting, urinating, defecating) comes into contact with the demands and prohibitions of society, there is immediate conflict. A new structure must emerge from the Id of the growing infant to insure that its drives are expressed in a socially acceptable way. Thus the unconscious Id\u2014Freud's metaphor for the whole range and strength of biological drives\u2014is forced to develop contact with reality through the emergence of a second structure: the Ego. Thus the Ego has the task of mediating between the primitive Id and society. Later on in development (via the Oedipal Conflict), the child internalizes the values of his parents. These internalized values become the third internal structure, which is called the Super Ego. These three hypothetical ego structures\u2014Id, Ego, and Super Ego\u2014mature and grow with experience. Freud postulated that all psychological development is based on the Id seeking satisfaction, the Ego curbing the Id's most extreme demands, and the Super Ego pressing the Ego to make morally correct choices. \n\nIn contrast, Fairbairn's is a '''relational/structure model''' in its assumption that the human psyche develops its structure from actual human experience, not from pressure from the Id, whose existence Fairbairn rejects. Instead, Fairbairn proposes that the human psyche develops structures based on actual interpersonal events. A child's growing and maturing internal ego structures can be understood as packages of memories that coalesce and form internal representations of the parents, of the child himself, and of the child's relationship to his parents. For Fairburn, the unconscious develops as a consequence of empathic failures of the parents that are too disruptive for the child's underdeveloped central ego to tolerate. Awareness of these failures would interfere with the child's absolute dependency on his parents, and knowledge of them would destroy the necessary illusion that he is loved and cherished. In families where punishment is frequent and severe, parental failures can be catastrophic to the child's developing sense of self. That is, the child can be so overwhelmed by parental aggression that it faces the loss of its sense of self, as described by Bromberg:     <blockquote>\nPsychological trauma occurs in situations, explicitly or implicitly interpersonal, in which self-invalidation (sometimes self-annihilation) cannot be escaped from or prevented, and from which there is no hope of protection, relief, or soothing. If the experience is either prolonged, [sic] assaultively violent, or if self-development is weak or immature, then the level of affective arousal is too great for the event to be experienced self-reflectively and given meaning through cognitive processing. \u2026 At its extreme, the subjective experience is that of a chaotic and terrifying flooding of affect that threatens to overwhelm sanity and psychological survival (Bromberg, 1998, 12).<ref>{{Cite book|last=Bromberg|first=Philip|title=Standing in The Spaces: Essays on Clinical Process, Trauma and Dissociation|publisher=Psychology Press|year=1998|isbn=0-88163-356-9|location=|pages=12}}</ref>     \n</blockquote>\nOver time, these dissociated events, including those in which the child's sense of self was endangered, become ego structures in the individual's internal world. (See the following section on splitting of the ego for a detailed explanation of this process.) Thus the human psyche acquires structure from the tensions of split-off traumas so toxic they remain unavailable to the individual's central ego. Therefore, the unconscious is not a biological inheritance of humankind but a development of specific parental failures and interpersonal traumas that were dissociated because they were too disruptive to remember.\n\n===='Schizoid Factors in the Personality' (1940)====\n\nIn his first paper, Fairbairn observed that many of his patients seemed \"schizoid\", which he defined as having '''splits in their ego structure''' directly resulting from dissociated memories in their central ego. That is, because the conscious ego does not know about the dissociated memories that are held in the unconscious, the central ego has had parts of it split off. \n\nHis schizoid patients had three defining characteristics:<blockquote>\n\u2026 (1) an attitude of omnipotence, (2) an attitude of isolation and detachment and, (3) a preoccupation with inner reality.\u2026 So as far as the preoccupation with inner reality is concerned, this is undoubtedly the most important of all schizoid characteristics; and it is not the less present whether inner reality be substituted for outer reality, identified with outer reality, or superimposed upon outer reality (Fairbairn, 1952, p:6-7).<ref name=\":2\">{{Cite book|last=Fairbairn|first=William Ronald Dodds|title=Psychoanalytic Studies of the Personality|publisher=Routledge & Kegan Paul|year=1952|isbn=0-7100-1361-2|location=London|pages=}}</ref></blockquote>\nThe more frequently a child encounters intolerable trauma, the larger the number of memories of actual lived experiences that are split off and unavailable to the conscious \"central ego\". The schizoid style of relating (or more accurately, non-relating) to others originates from repeated rejections of the child's legitimate need for love and emotional support during his developmental years. The schizoid child was raised by a mother who was unable to relate to her child with tender, loving emotions, and as a direct consequence of this rejection, the child withdraws into his inner world, which, though safer, is ultimately less satisfying. Fairbairn spells this out starkly:\n<blockquote>\nRegressive reinstatement of the early oral attitude (the earliest form of dependency) would appear to be most readily brought about by a situation of emotional frustration in which the child comes to feel (a) that he is not really loved for himself as a person by his mother, and (b) that his own love for his mother is not really valued and accepted by her. This is a highly traumatic situation, giving rise to a further situation characterized as follows: (a) the child comes to regard his mother as a Bad Object in so far as she does not seem to love him, (b) The child comes to regard outward expressions of his own love as bad, with the result that ... he tends to retain his love inside of himself. (c) The child comes to feel that love relationships with external objects in general are bad, or at least precarious (Fairbairn, 1952:17-18).<ref name=\":2\" /> \n</blockquote>\nLack of love in a young child's life is so traumatic and disruptive to his attachment that these parental failures force him to use the dissociative defense, causing splits in his ego. \n\nTypically, Fairbairn returned again and again to topics that he had discussed in his early papers as he was gradually expanding his observations while creating a coherent model. For example, in a quote from his 1941 paper on the schizoid personality style, Fairbairn observes that the unloved child feels his love is destructive because his parents do not value or accept it, and because they do not return his love. Thus the child blames himself for not being lovable, which deflects the blame from his unloving parents on to himself. He continues the illusion that he has loving parents that reject him for a good reason, i.e., that he is toxic. This theme will come up again in the 1943 paper when Fairbairn described \"The Moral Defense Against Bad Objects\" a cognitive defense in which the child blames himself for the parental failures. In the next quote, Fairbairn uses the Freudian concept of 'libido', which Freud defined as the mix of sex and aggression in the Id. Fairbairn was forced to use the preexisting language of psychoanalysis, however he took the word \"libido\" and changed it to mean a child's love for his parents or love of other external objects:<blockquote>\nIt is the great tragedy of the schizoid individual that his love seems to destroy: and it is because his love seems so destructive that he experiences such difficulty in directing libido toward objects in outer reality. He becomes afraid to love: and therefore he erects barriers between his objects and himself. He tends to both keep his objects at a distance and to make himself remote from them. He rejects his objects: and at the same time he withdraws libido from them. This withdrawal of libido may be carried to all lengths. It may be carried to a point at which all emotional and physical contacts with other persons are renounced; and it may even go so far that all libidinal links with outer reality are surrendered, all interest in the world around fades and everything becomes meaningless. In proportion as libido is withdrawn from outer objects it is directed toward internalized objects: and in proportion as this happens the person becomes introverted (Fairbairn 1952, p.50)<ref name=\":2\" />.    \n</blockquote>\nSimply put, the unloved child who has directed his love toward his parents, only to be rebuffed, gives up hope that he will ever be loved, and as a consequence holds his love inside. He gives up on human relationships, focusing instead on his inner world and its fantasies and dreams of success.\n\n===='A Revised Psychopathology of the Psychoses and Psychoneuroses  (1941)'====\nFairbairn was gradually forming  his model in these first papers. He  challenged Freud's drive theory directly in this second paper by  stating \"Nevertheless, it would appear as if the point had now been reached at which, in the interest of progress, the classical libido theory would have to be transformed into ''a theory of development based essentially upon object-relationships,'' Fairbairn (1952,p,31).<ref name=\":2\" />  Unfortunately, the shift in focus from drive theory to object relations theory was too great for the psychoanalytic community to accept, because Freud's entire model was based on the existence and activity of libidinal drives. All of psychoanalysis was Freudian, there were no other options, and yet Fairbairn asked his colleagues to choose between his model and Freud's. They overwhelming chose Freud. From this point on, his model was seen as an interesting intellectual exercise, rather than as a viable analytic model that would, over time, become one of the foundational models of  \"Relational Psychoanalysis\" of simply \"Relationality\"<ref>{{Cite book|last=Mitchell|first=Stephen|title=Relationality: From Attachment to Intersubjectivity|publisher=The Analytic Press|year=2000|isbn=0-88163-322-4|location=|pages=}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Mitchell, Stephen & Aron, Lewis|first=|title=Relational Psychoanalysis: The Emergence of a Tradition|publisher=The Analytic Press|year=1999|isbn=0-88163-270-8|location=|pages=}}</ref>.\nFairbairn proposed an outline of a developmental model in this chapter as well. He noted that human development was characterized by a gradual differentiation (separation both physically and psychologically) from the parent because of the emergence  of a mature, reality based, central ego in the young adult. This allows the young adult to begin life on his own, find a partner and produce the next generation.<blockquote>The development of object-relationships is essentially a process whereby infantile dependence upon the object gradually gives place to mature dependence upon the object. The process of development is characterized (a) by the gradual abandonment of an original object relationship based on primary identification, and (b) the gradual adoption of an object-relationship based upon differentiation of the object (Fairbairn, 1952, p.34)<ref name=\":2\" /> </blockquote>\nThus, the developmental process requires that the individual no longer sees himself as part of his mother, but rather as an independent, fully functioning person. Unfortunately, many children are not supported and loved sufficiently to go through the \"transitional\" stage easily. They do not feel  secure and cannot engage in age appropriate activity with their peers. Instead, they are looking backwards toward their mother for more support, rather than toward the outside world of other children and healthy play. Fairbairn noted this in one of his most famous quotes:<blockquote>\nThe greatest need of a child is to obtain conclusive assurance (a) that he is genuinely loved as a person by his parents, and (b) that his parents genuinely accept his love. It is only in so far as such assurance is forthcoming in a form sufficiently convincing to enable him to depend safely upon his real objects (parents) that he is able to gradually renounce infantile dependence without misgiving. In the absence of such assurance his relationships to his objects is fraught with too much anxiety over separation to enable him to renounce the attitude of infantile dependence: for such a renunciation would be equivalent in his eyes to forfeiting all hope of ever obtaining the satisfaction of his unsatisfied emotional needs. '''Frustration of his desire to be loved as a person, and frustration of his desire to have his love accepted, is the greatest trauma that a child can experience''' (Fairbairn, 1952, p.39-40)<ref name=\":2\" /> </blockquote>\nThus, the dependent child cannot mature and go on to the next developmental step as he is fearful of increased separation from his parents without being sure of their love and support.  Their support and encouragement  gives him enough courage to let them go, and establish new relationships with peers and future partners. The child who is unsure of his parents' love remains emotionally underdeveloped, and often remains at home, trying to obtain the love that was not forthcoming in his developmental history (Celani, 2005)<ref name=\":5\">{{Cite book|last=Celani|first=David|title=Leaving Home|publisher=Columbia Universities Press|year=2005|isbn=978-0-231-13477-4|location=New York|pages=}}</ref>.  \n\nThe unloved child attempts to comfort himself by becoming increasingly \"schizoid\". That is, he turns away from the harsh world of his family and towards his internalized memories of others, including his parents, for reassurance that they are with him and available at all times. Unfortunately, most of his internalized memories are negative (see the relationship between the antilibidinal ego ad he rejecting object in the splitting section). Despite the negativity, the endless struggle between these internalized split off part self and part object provides the comfort of the known and familiar. Clearly, this is a half measure, but it is the best that the ignored or rejected child can do under the circumstances, as he cannot change his parents or force them to love him.  Secondly,  the rejected child comforts himself with \"substitutive satisfactions\"  which Fairbairn assumed were forms of immature sexuality. Today, the unloved, schizoid child has only to turn to the internet for an endless number of fantasy based videos that compensate him for his lack of love, lack of power and desire for revenge that temporarily lessen his pain. Fairbairn was clear about this regressive return to the inner world because of the harshness of the external world: \"Fundamentally, these substitutive satisfactions ...all represent ''relationships with internalized objects, to which the individual is compelled to turn in default of satisfactory relationships with objects in the outer world\"(Italics in the original) Fairbairn, 1952, p.40)''<ref name=\":2\" />. This observation of Fairbairn's  has come true for millions of alienated and unloved children who spend hour upon hour avoiding interactions with external people while immersed in their video fantasy world. This is the most satisfaction that they can get from their lives, as their relationships with their parents are so frustrating. \n\nFairbairn also discussed the difficulties in separating from unloving parents in this 1941 paper. He recognized that the lack of early support left the child with very few emotional resources to sustain himself when he left home and faced the world alone. He called the stage between \"infantile dependence\" and \"mature interdependence' the stage of \"Transition\".<blockquote>The great conflict of the transition stage may now be formulated as a conflict between a progressive urge to surrender the infantile attitude of identification with the object and a regressive urge to maintain that attitude. During this period, accordingly, the behavior of the individual is characterized both by desperate endeavors on his part to separate from the object and desperate endeavors to achieve reunion with the object-desperate attempts \"to escape from prison' and desperate attempts \"to return home\" (Fairbairn, 1952, p.43).<ref name=\":2\" /></blockquote>The less the child has been supported in his early years, the less chance he/she has of a successful transition into adulthood. The huge number of \"adult\" aged individual who either live at home with their ageing parents, or others who live separately, but fixated in an adolescent time warp is enormous. In either case, they have been unable to enter mature relationships because they are still seeking the support and encouragement that they missed out on in childhood <ref name=\":5\" />.   \n\n===='The Repression and the Return of Bad Objects (1943)' ====\nFairbairn's third theoretical paper further alienated those few members of the analytic community who found his work acceptable as he had the temerity to once again urge the replacement of drive theory with his object relations theory.<blockquote>Amongst the conclusions formulated in the above mentioned paper (his 1941 paper) two of the most far reaching are the following:(1) that libidinal\"aims\" are of secondary importance in comparison with object-relationships and (2) that a relationship with the object, and not gratification of the impulse, is the ultimate aim of libidinal striving (Fairbairn, 1952, p.60)<ref name=\":2\" />  </blockquote>This is '''not''' what the analytic community was looking for, as Fairbairn reduced Freud's concept of Libido to a secondary position as compared to his vision of the child's motivation which was to search for a good object and establish a loving  relationship with another human being. To make matters much worse, Fairbairn then formally re-defined the human unconscious, not as a container of biological drives, but rather compendium of  memories of interpersonal events that were too destructive to the child's needed attachment to his parents for his developing ego to accept. The became a dilemma for the field of psychoanalysis as Fairbairn's unconscious was so different from the \"standard\" Freudian view of the unconscious.  <blockquote>I now venture to formulate the view that what are primarily repressed are neither intolerably guilty impulses nor intolerably unpleasant memories, but intolerably bad internalized objects. If memories are repressed, accordingly, this is only because the objects involved in such memories are identified with bad internalized objects (Fairbairn, 1952,p.62)<ref name=\":2\" />  </blockquote>Fairbairn was ahead of himself in this quote because  he had not yet defined a \"'''bad object'''\", which is a parent or guardian that the child looks to for love,help, guidance, and support, and who fails the child again and again. Note that Fairbairn uses the word repressed rather than dissociated in this quote. Repression is used to describe the psychological defense of holding of material in the unconscious that is already present. Dissociation describes the psychological act of actively \"forgetting\" a overwhelmingly traumatic event in the external world  and simultaneously forcing it into in the unconscious. Once there,  it is held out of awareness by repression. In this short quote Fairbairn dismisses Freud's notion of biological forces that were claimed to be the fundamental motivator of humankind and replaced them with the assumption that the human unconscious was developed from the dissociation of traumatic rejections during  which the child needs were ignored or dismissed.  Once in the unconscious, they resonate throughout the individuals life. Then Fairbairn went on to clearly define these split off memories in the unconscious as the basic source of human psychopathology.  <blockquote>Whether any given individual becomes delinquent, psychoneurotic, psychotic or simply \"normal\" would appear to depend in the main upon the operation of three factors: (1) the extent to which bad objects have been installed in the unconscious and the degree of badness by which they are characterized, (2) the extent to which the ego is identified with internalized bad objects, and (3) the nature and strength of the defenses which protect the ego from these objects (Fairbairn, 1952, p.65)<ref name=\":2\" /> .</blockquote>The child who is so unfortunate to be born in a family where the parents are absent, indifferent or abusive is going to experience and internalize a huge number of bad object interactions. These dissociated memories form large and powerful inner structures that will influence his view of himself and his perception of external reality. The next two factors can exacerbate or  mitigate the impact of these internalizations. For instance a boy who sees his father beat his mother may identify with this behavior and then re-enact this pattern in his adulthood. Conversely a female child might identify with her mother and internalize the role of a victim of abuse. The third factor is also significant as the highly defended individual will remember little or nothing of the traumas he/she experienced in childhood and will have a greater probability of re-enacting one role or the other because they have no ability to \"mentalize\", or think about and  process the traumatic event so as to understand what happened to them when they were a defenseless child. Instead, the internalized patterns will re-emerge and be acted out with the next generation. This is called the \"intergenerational transmission of trauma\".                  \n\nFairbairn noticed that children whom had been removed from their families because of extreme neglect or abuse (this was in 1940's Scotland) made endless excuses for their parents and assumed that they were responsible for the treatment that they were receiving. That is, their parents were punishing them because they were dirty, disobedient, or lazy. The child assumed that he was the cause of the parent's hostile behavior toward them. Fairbairn called this the \"Moral Defense Against Bad Objects\" Once again, the child is desperate to support the illusion that he is living within a  loving family. parents.         <blockquote>It become obvious, therefore, that the child would rather be bad himself than have bad objects: and accordingly we have some justification for surmising that  one of his motives in becoming bad is to make his objects \"good'. In becoming bad he is really taking upon himself the burden of badness which appears to reside in his objects. By this means he seeks to purge them of his badness: and in proportion as he succeeds in doing so,he is rewarded by that sense of security which an environment of good objects so characteristically confers....Outer security is thus purchased at the price of inner insecurity (Fairbairn, 1952, p.65)<ref name=\":2\" />.        </blockquote>This defense is a cognitive defense in that the child is explaining to himself why he is being punished or neglected. By saying it is his fault, he absolves his parents and gives them a \"good\" reason for treating him badly. But, as Fairbairn notes, it continues the pattern of using defenses to continue to create the illusion of a loving family, and it distorts reality. The child prefers to believe that he has a \"moral\" defect, such as laziness, disrespect, or dirty, all of which are potentially correctable, than see that his parents are emotionally bankrupt. Worse, the defensive self blame erodes what little self worth the child may have developed. This defense is really a precursor to the splitting defense that Fairbairn described in his next paper (1944). It is a primitive form of splitting in that he parental objects are \"all good\", and the child himself is \"all bad\". Fairbairn never went back to his earlier concepts and corrected them or explained his evolving thought that motivated him to change his theory over time.              \n\nIn the following section of this paper,Fairbairn continued his discussion of the different aspects of the child's dependency on his objects. Once again, these concepts would have been more appropriate in his 1941 paper where he first discussed the issue of dependency. However, the reader is given an opportunity to actually see how a major innovator of a psychoanalytic theory gradually created a model. His mind was not linear, and many topics came to mind again and again, dependency being the most frequent topic.Here, he observes the intense need of the child for his parents and the child's inability to reject them, regardless of how they treated him.        <blockquote>The child not only internalizes his bad objects because they force themselves upon him and he seeks to control them, but also,and above all, because he ''needs'' them. If a child's parents are bad objects, he cannot eject them, even if they do not force themselves upon him: for he cannot do without them. '''Even if they neglect him, he cannot reject them: for if they neglect him, his need for them is increased''' (Fairbairn, 1952,p.67)<ref name=\":2\" />.        </blockquote>Fairbairn made this revolutionary observation and at the time it went unnoticed. The '''neglected child needs the parent more, rather than less''' because the individual's earlier needs were never fulfilled, and they do not suddenly disappear or resolve themselves. This observation seems counter-intuitive when seen from an adult perspective, because a mature individual would leave in a minute.  However, the reality of many  young adults from neglectful families is that they are pressured to remain with their abusive parents from their own unmet needs. They may have unmet needs from age 4, 5,6,7,8 (and so on) that were  never met, so as a young adult this individual has '''no possibility whatsoever of separating''' from his neglectful parents and beginning a life of his own. This was one of Fairbairn's great insights which can be seen in virtually all patients.                \n\nFairbairn then took up new topics in he same paper- which is one of his two greatest (the second being his 1944 paper which will be described in the next section). The two topics were his theory of treatment and his view of resistance. Neither actually belongs in this paper- his 1958 paper on treatment would have been the better site, but once again, his mind was not linear. First, Fairbairn throws out a comment that has far ranging implications in the treatment process.                 <blockquote>Nevertheless, I cannot help feeling that such results must be attributed, in part at least, to the fact that in the transference situation the patient is provided in reality with an unwontedly good object, and is thereby placed in a position to risk a release of his internalized bad objects from the unconscious and so to provide conditions for the libidinal cathexis of these objects to be dissolved-albeit he is also under a temptation to exploit a \"good\" relationship  with he analyst as a defense against taking this risk (Fairbairn, 1952, p.69) .<ref name=\":2\" />                  </blockquote>Fairbairn  identifies one of he mutaive factors in psychotherapy as the \"good relationship\" between the therapist patient as one that might provoke a derepression of the memories of abuse and neglect held in the unconscious. He sees the relationship between patient and therapist as providing the patient with enough confidence and support to allow him to \"remember\" or more accurately, de-repress\" memories of neglect and abuse from his childhood. He also uses the word \"libidinal cathexis\" in his quote which is a holdover from the Freudian model. It means emotional investment of libidinal energy in the other person, which when translated into Fairbairn's terminology means attachment. Thus, a relationship with a new, good object can loosen up the attachment to internalized bad object, as the good object offers the patient an alternative attachment.. In reality, this process seldom happens until treatment is well underway and the therapist is specifically aiming to unearth this type of material.  Most frequently, the patient clings to his illusions of a nurturant family as well as to the illusion that he is somehow defective.\n\n=== The splitting of the ego ===\n{{Main|Splitting (psychology)}}\nFairbairn recognized that  children are  totally and absolutely dependent on their parents. Because of this dependency they cannot tolerate \"knowing\" that their parents are indifferent, abandoning, and perhaps even abusive. They solve the problem of \"knowing\" about their parents' rejection of them by dissociating memories of interactions that were intolerable to accept. The defense of dissociation was seen as an extreme defense that was only used  in life-threatening situations. Fairbairn had worked in an orphanage associated with the University of Edinburgh <ref>{{Cite book|title=Fairbairn's journey into the interior|last=Sutherland, John Derg, 1905- ...|date=1999|publisher=Free Association Books|isbn=1-85343-059-5|oclc=470458410}}</ref>as one of his part-time appointments and his experiences with children separated from their families alerted him to the reality that the child's extreme dependency on their parents makes any abandonment a major trauma. The powerful defense called '''dissociation''' was needed to erase the event from their consciousness. The memory of the rejecting parent, along with the  memory of the child's response to that parent, are forced into the unconscious and held there by repression. This allows the child to continue loving a parent that he sees as completely supportive. Once dissociated, these memories of the child in relationship to the parent become internal ego structures over time. In families where rejection is commonplace, the thousands upon thousands of dissociated memories accrue and become powerful sub-personalities. Memories of the angry, annoyed, rejecting or indifferent parent must be dissociated, for if the child were to \"see\" this reality it would destroy his dependency relationship on the parent and he would face an abandonment crisis. In addition to the memories of the rejecting parent (The '''Rejecting Object''' in Fairbairn's model) the child must also dissociate memories of himself during the interpersonally rejecting interactions. Fairbairn called the ego structure that develops from the dissociated memories of  the child's  self  as he reacted to the parent's rejection of him and his legitimate needs, the '''Antilibidinal Ego'''. These memories of the self as fearful, defeated, shamed and humiliated cannot be tolerated consciously. The antagonistic and bickering  relationship between the Antilibidinal Ego and the internalized Rejecting Object that are held in the inner world continues unabated in dialogues between them, as described by Ogden: \n\n\"Neither the rejecting object nor the internal saboteur (the antilibidinal ego) is willing or able to think about, much less relinquish, that tie. In fact, there is no desire on the part of either to change anything about their mutual dependence. The power of that bond is impossible to overestimate. The rejecting object and the internal saboteur are determined to nurse their feelings of having been deeply wronged, cheated, humiliated, betrayed, exploited, treated unfairly, discriminated against, and so on. The mistreatment at the hands of the other is felt to be unforgivable. An apology is forever expected by each, but never offered by either\" (Odgen,2018)<ref>{{Citation|last=Ogden|first=Thomas H.|chapter=Why read Fairbairn? *|date=2018-03-08|pages=131\u2013146|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-429-47453-8|doi=10.4324/9780429474538-12|title=Fairbairn and the Object Relations Tradition}}</ref>  \n\nWithin the child's inner world (his unconscious) '''the Antilibidinal Ego relates only to the \"Rejecting Object\",''' and this pair of self and object structures are unknown to the conscious '''Central Ego''' that is in contact with the acceptable aspects of the parent (the '''Ideal Object''') and with external reality.  In extremely negative families there are so few supportive, positive interactions with the parents that the child is forced, by necessity to create hope for himself by developing a second set of views of himself in relationship to his parent. In Fairbairn's model the need of the child for a positive parent is so intense that he creates a \"good\" parent  for himself. That is, without a loving parent the child's bond and attachment to his parent would be broken, and he would experience a sense of complete abandonment. The child avoids this crisis by creating a second vision of the parent, one that is based on idealization and fantasy which (mis)perceives the parent as filled with the potential of love. This second vision of the parent is built out of the occasional positive or tender interaction that he has experienced with his mostly rejecting parents.  This fantasy-based parent (which becomes an ego structure) was called the '''Exciting Object''' by Fairbairn, and the child's self that relates to it was called the '''Libidinal Ego''' (or Self).  The attachment between the Antilibidinal Ego and the Rejecting Object is intense as they struggle to convince each other of their claims against the other. Similarly the attachment between the intensely needy Libidinal Ego and the Exciting Object is equally powerful. The combination of the attachments of these  two mostly unconscious selves to these part objects constitutes what Fairbairn defined as an attachment to the '''Bad Object'''.  The Bad Object has two facets: the Antilibidinal Ego argues with and complains about its mistreatment to the Rejecting Object in an attempt to reform it, while the Libidinal Ego seeks ways to find out how to please the Exciting Object which promises it love which is always out of reach. \n\nThese two unconscious pairs: \n* The '''Antilibidinal Ego''' that relates to the '''Rejecting Object''', and \n* the '''Libidinal Ego''' that relates only to the '''Exciting Object''' \nare unknown to each other and to the Central Ego. '''Splitting''' allows the child to hate the rejecting object with a feral rage, and to love the Exciting Object with all its heart. Splitting is a defense that prevents the integration of Good and Bad Object memories into a single whole Object. Thus, the individual  never develops \"object constancy\" which is the ability to see a person's goodness, even when they are being rejected or frustrated by that person. Thus, a very important developmental milestone is not achieved, and the individual functions at an earlier stage of childhood development, often throughout life. Splitting causes the individual to respond to external objects '''as if they were two different people.''' When the individual is frustrated they see the object as \"all bad\" and devoid of any goodness. Conversely, when they are dominated by their  Libidinal Ego structure they see the object as \"all good\". Developmentally, this is equivalent to the child who screams at her mother in a rage, and minutes later says \"I love you, Mommy\". There is no memory of the other ego state. Equally importantly, powerful, emotion filled memories are dissociated, which impoverishes and weakens the Central Ego, which is unaware of significant realities from its developmental history.<ref>{{Cite book|url=isbn 978-0-231-14907-5|title=Fairbairn's Object Relations Theory in the Clinical Setting Columbia University Press|last=Celani|first=David|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2010|isbn=978-3-11-053768-0|location=|pages=|oclc=1007218368}}</ref>\n\n'''Fairbairn's Structural Model'''\n\nEmotional deprivation, and the resulting fear of abandonment, leads to splitting of the ego, and the split ego eventuates into Fairbairn's Structural Theory. As just described, the psyche is split into three pairs of selves that relate to three separate objects:\n* The Central Ego relates to the Ideal Object\n* The Antilibidinal Ego relates to the Rejecting Object\n* The Libidinal Ego relates to the Exciting Object\n\nThe three pairs of structures relate only to each other and are '''unaware''' of the other two pairs. In effect, this structural model is the beginning stage of a multiple personality, however '''it never develops beyond this steady state.''' As described, the Central Ego develops in relationship to the supportive and nurturing parent(s), the Ideal Object(s). The strength and size of the Central Ego varies from child to child according to how many positive, ego enhancing activities and interpersonal events they have experienced during their development. Fairbairn's model assumes that actual events in reality summate in both the conscious Central Ego and in the unconscious structures as well. Thus large numbers of loving, non-intrusive, and emotionally supportive interactions with the parent(s) enhance the child's Central Ego through daily positive relating. As the child develops over time his trust in others allows him to interact with new adults and children and is able to develop new skills, as well as enlarge a more complex view of himself through interactions with others who see aspects of himself that his parents have not discovered. \n\nIn less favorable developmental conditions, where support, nurturance and reassurance is scarce or absent, the child's Central Ego does not develop a richer and more rounded sense of self, rather the  development of his Central Ego is thwarted rather than enhanced. At the same time, his many negative experiences are being dissociated and repressed, and his Central Ego has lost sight of the many important (but negative) events in his childhood, which are banished (and remain) in his unconscious structures.  The ratio of conscious to unconscious structures shifts away from conscious relationships with external objects to the child's powerful and richly populated unconscious, with the endless bickering between the Antilibidinal Ego and the Rejecting Object, and the unrealistic fantasy world of the Libidinal Ego seeking the key to the love that it assumes  (incorrectly) is stored in their parent (the Exciting Object''')'''. This powerful unconscious influences the weakened Central Ego and is the source of both transference and repetition compulsions.<ref name=\":4\">{{Cite book|title=Fairbairn's Object Relations Theory In the Clinical Setting|last=Celani|first=David|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0-231-14907-5|location=New York|pages=51\u201371}}</ref> \n\n'''Transference, Resistance and Repetition Compulsions'''\n\nWhen any individual superimposes or projects his inner structures on an external object (for instance, his Rejecting Object) then he is going to misperceive that individual's intentions and behavior, and relate to him in a passive-aggressive and hostile manner. Thus projection of the inner structures onto external objects becomes the source of transference.  This happens when the unconscious structures are powerful and the Central Ego is weakened and has poor contact with external objects.<br />\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.columbia.edu/~rr322/FAIRBAIRN.html 'Fairbairn's Structural Model'], Richard L.

{"title_page": "List of Calgary municipal elections", "text_new": "This is a list of municipal elections held in the city of [[Calgary]], [[Alberta]], [[Canada]].\n\nElections for mayor were held annually until after the 1923 election, when the election term was changed to two-year terms. From the 1971 election, the mayoral term was three years. And since 2013 the term is four years.\n\nIn the 1920s, Calgary votes also elected city commissioners.\n\nElections for councillors and aldermen were held annually until the 1914 election, when the terms switched to two-year overlapping terms, with half of the council up for election each year.  From the 1971 election to 2013, the aldermanic elections lined up fully with the mayoral elections, and were also for three-year terms.<ref name=electhist>{{cite web |title=Calgary Civic Elections |url=http://www.am770chqr.com/elections/civic/history.aspx |publisher=AM 770 |accessdate=October 25, 2010 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130116223121/http://www.am770chqr.com/elections/civic/history.aspx |archive-date=January 16, 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nFrom 1884 to 1886, four councillors were selected from the town.\n\nIn 1894, Calgary was divided into three wards, increasing the number of councillors to six, two in each. Later, three aldermen represented each ward. In 1906, a fourth ward was created, bringing the total number of aldermen to 12.\n\nAldermanic elections were held using block voting (each voter had as many votes as there were seats to fill in the ward).\n\nFrom 1914 to 1960, aldermen were elected from across the city, dismantling the ward system. They were elected for two-year terms, but Staggered elections made half the council up for election each year.\n\nIn 1917 Calgary brought in a system of Proportional Representation, under which city councillors were elected at large using [[Single Transferable Voting]] (STV) and a single multiple-member district covering the whole city. This survived until 1961. This system is said to have produced the emergence and increased representation of neighbourhood or community-based political groups.<ref>J. Paul Johnston and Miriam Koene, \"Learning History's Lessons Anew. The Use of STV in Canadian Municipal Elections,\" in Shawn Bowler and Bernard Grofman, Elections in Australia, Ireland and Malta under the Single Transferable Vote, p. 218-219, 229</ref>\n\nIn 1961, retaining the single transferable votes, Calgary switched to a ward system in which multiple city councillors were elected in each ward in 1961 and 1971 - the elections in between were held according to [[Alternative Vote]] in which one councillor was elected in each ward.<ref>J. Paul Johnston and Miriam Koene, \"Learning History's Lessons Anew. The Use of STV in Canadian Municipal Elections,\" in Shawn Bowler and Bernard Grofman, Elections in Australia, Ireland and Malta under the Single Transferable Vote, p. 218-219, 229</ref>\n\nCalgary moved to a ward system (six wards each represented by two alderman) starting in the 1961 election. With the subsequent election, staggered terms meant only one councillor was elected each election in each ward. That plus the retention of single transferable voting meant [[Instant run-off voting|Alternative Voting]], instead of STV. \n\nPrevious to 1971 election, terms of aldermanic service were extended to three years, and all ward seats were elected simultaneously in 1971, through STV. \n\nIn 1974, all seats were vacant and the election was held with multiple members elected in each ward, the last big moment for STV in Calgary.

of [[Calgary]], [[Alberta]], [[Canada]].\n\nElections for mayor were held annually until after the 1923 election, when the election term was changed to two-year terms. From the 1971 election, the mayoral term was three years. And since 2013 the term is four years.\n\nIn the 1920s, Calgary votes also elected city commissioners.\n\nElections for councillors and aldermen were held annually until the 1914 election, when the terms switched to two-year overlapping terms, with half of the council up for election each year.  From the 1971 election to 2013, the aldermanic elections lined up fully with the mayoral elections, and were also for three-year terms.<ref name=electhist>{{cite web |title=Calgary Civic Elections |url=http://www.am770chqr.com/elections/civic/history.aspx |publisher=AM 770 |accessdate=October 25, 2010 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130116223121/http://www.am770chqr.com/elections/civic/history.aspx |archive-date=January 16, 2013 |url-status=dead }}</ref>\n\nFrom 1884 to 1886, four councillors were selected from the town.\n\nIn 1894, Calgary was divided into three wards, increasing the number of councillors to six, two in each. Later, three aldermen represented each ward. In 1906, a fourth ward was created, bringing the total number of aldermen to 12.\n\nAldermanic elections were held using block voting (each voter had as many votes as there were seats to fill in the ward).\n\nFrom 1914 to 1960, aldermen were elected from across the city, dismantling the ward system. They were elected for two-year terms, but Staggered elections made half the council up for election each year.\n\nIn 1917 Calgary brought in a system of Proportional Representation, under which city councillors were elected at large using [[Single Transferable Voting]] (STV) and a single multiple-member district covering the whole city. This survived until 1961. This system is said to have produced the emergence and increased representation of neighbourhood or community-based political groups.<ref>J. Paul Johnston and Miriam Koene, \"Learning History's Lessons Anew. The Use of STV in Canadian Municipal Elections,\" in Shawn Bowler and Bernard Grofman, Elections in Australia, Ireland and Malta under the Single Transferable Vote, p. 218-219, 229</ref>\n\nIn 1961, retaining the single transferable votes, Calgary switched to a ward system in which multiple city councillors were elected in each ward in 1961 and 1971 - the elections in between were held according to [[Alternative Vote]] in which one councillor was elected in each ward.<ref>J. Paul Johnston and Miriam Koene, \"Learning History's Lessons Anew. The Use of STV in Canadian Municipal Elections,\" in Shawn Bowler and Bernard Grofman, Elections in Australia, Ireland and Malta under the Single Transferable Vote, p. 218-219, 229</ref>\n\nCalgary moved to a ward system (six wards each represented by two alderman) starting in the 1961 election. With the subsequent election, staggered terms meant only one councillor was elected each election in each ward. That plus the retention of single transferable voting meant [[Instant run-off voting|Alternative Voting]], instead of STV. \n\nPrevious to 1971 election, terms of aldermanic service were extended to three years, and all ward seats were elected simultaneously in 1971, through STV. \n\nIn 1974, all seats were vacant and the election was held with multiple members elected in each ward, the last big moment for STV in Calgary. This was Calgary's last election held using STV.\n\nPrevious to the 1977 election, the number of wards was expanded to 14 (the current number) with one alderman representing each ward, three year terms.\n\nOn December 14, 2010, council voted to change the title to ''councillor'', which took effect in the October 2013 election.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://calgaryherald.com/news/Calgary+rejects+alderman+label+after+years/3972721/story.html |title=Calgary rejects alderman label after 116 years |author=Jason Markusoff |date=December 14, 2010 |publisher=Calgary Herald |accessdate=December 14, 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101218020109/http://www.calgaryherald.com/news/Calgary%2Brejects%2Balderman%2Blabel%2Bafter%2Byears/3972721/story.html |archivedate=December 18, 2010 }}</ref> In 2012 the Local Authorities Election Act was amended to increase the term length of the mayor and councillors to 4 years.<ref>{{cite web|title=Election Accountability Amendment Act, 2012 - Section 105|url=http://www.assembly.ab.ca/ISYS/LADDAR_files/docs/bills/bill/legislature_28/session_1/20120523_bill-007.pdf|work=2012 Bill 7, First Session, 28th Legislature|publisher=Legislative Assembly of Alberta|accessdate=December 9, 2012|date=December 5, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://canlii.ca/t/81zz |archive-url=https://archive.is/20170914200222/http://canlii.ca/t/81zz |url-status=dead |archive-date=2017-09-14 |title=Local Authorities Election Act, RSA 2000, c L-21 |publisher=[[CanLII]] |access-date=2016-01-04 }}</ref>\n\nSchool board elections are also held in line with city council elections.

It is loosely based on a short story by [[Ray Bradbury]] (which in turn was based on his 1948 radio play for the [[CBS]] show ''[[Suspense_(radio_drama)|Suspense]]'') with a script written by Merwin Gerard. The film was produced by [[Universal Television]] and originally aired as an ''[[ABC Movie of the Week]]'' on January 29, 1972. It features [[John Williams]]'s last score (to date) for a TV movie.\n\n==Plot==\nDe Havilland plays Laura Wynant, a wealthy former mental patient who has travelled to her country estate to recuperate. While there, she discovers, when hearing faint calls for help, that a woman has been buried alive on her property. Wynant tries to inform others of what she has found but nobody believes her, and her family begins to suspect a relapse in her mental condition. Because her hands are nearly crippled by arthritis, she is not able to dig the woman up herself. She tricks a local boy into assisting her by telling him she is digging for a lost earring, but when he is scared by the cries of the buried woman she is forced to tell him the truth, which results in a confrontation with the lad's angry father. While going door-to-door to seek help she encounters the buried woman's husband, who had buried her after striking her on the head with a shovel and thought her dead. Wynant is confined to her home under doctor's orders but, in a fit of desperation, experiences enough recovery from the arthritis to provide strength in her hands. She begins to dig up the buried woman, who is still alive. Just then the murderous husband arrives on the scene, intending to bury his wife's body thoroughly. He comes up behind Wynant and is about to strike her with the shovel when the buried woman grabs Wynant's hand and pulls herself up out of the ground. The husband is petrified, giving the authorities just enough time to arrive on the scene and save Wynant and the buried woman.\n\n==Cast<ref>{{Citation|title=The Screaming Woman|url=http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0067721/|access-date=2020-04-01}}</ref>==\n* [[Olivia De Havilland]] as Laura Wynant\n* [[Ed Nelson]] as Carl Nesbitt\n* [[Laraine Stephens]] as Caroline Wynant\n* [[Joseph Cotten]] as George Tresvant\n* [[Walter Pidgeon]] as Dr. Amos Larkin\n* [[Charles Knox Robinson]] as Howard Wynant\n* [[Alexandra Hay]] as Evie Carson\n* [[Lonny Chapman]] as Police Sergeant\n* [[Charles Drake (actor)|Charles Drake]] as Ken Bronson\n* Russell Wiggins as Harry Sands\n* [[Gene Andrusco]] as David\n* Joyce Cunningham as Bernice Wilson\n* Jan Arvan as Martin, the Servant\n* Jay Montgomery as Ted Wilson\n* John Alderman as Slater\n\n==Television debuts==\nThe film was first shown in the United States on January 29, 1972, in Sweden on June 23, 1973, and in Great Britain in July 1985.\n\n==Other adaptations==\nA television adaptation more faithful to the source material was broadcast as \"The Screaming Woman\", episode 5 of season 1 of ''[[The Ray Bradbury Theater]]'', on February 22, 1986.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}1972 NBC show. \n<br />{{Jack Smight}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Screaming Woman, The}}\n[[Category:1972 television films]]\n[[Category:1970s horror thriller films]]\n[[Category:1972 horror films]]\n[[Category:ABC Movie of the Week]]\n[[Category:American horror thriller films]]\n[[Category:American films]]\n[[Category:Horror television films]]\n[[Category:Films directed by Jack Smight]]\n[[Category:Films scored by John Williams]]\n[[Category:Films based on short fiction]]\n[[Category:Films based on works by Ray Bradbury]]\n", "text_old": "{{unsourced|date=October 2019}}\n{{Infobox television\n| show_name            = The Screaming Woman\n| image                = The Screaming Woman.jpg\n| image_size           = \n| image_alt            = \n| caption              = Title card\n| genre                = \n| based_on             = A short story by [[Ray Bradbury]]\n| writer               = Merwin Gerard\n| director             = [[Jack Smight]]\n| starring             = [[Olivia de Havilland]]<br>[[Ed Nelson]]<br>[[Laraine Stephens]]<br>[[Joseph Cotten]]\n| music                = [[John Williams]]\n| country              = United States\n| language             = English\n| producer             = William Frye\n| editor               = Robert F.
