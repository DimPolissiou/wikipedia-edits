(film)|What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?]]'' (1962)]]\n\nThe '''Joan Crawford filmography''' lists the film appearances of American actress '''[[Joan Crawford]]''', who starred in numerous [[feature film]]s throughout a lengthy career that spanned nearly five decades.\n\nShe made her film debut in ''[[Lady of the Night]]'' (1925) as a [[body double]] for film star [[Norma Shearer]]. She appeared in several other films before she made her major breakthrough playing [[Lon Chaney]]'s love interest in the 1927 [[horror film]] ''[[The Unknown (1927 film)|The Unknown]]''. Her major success in ''[[Our Dancing Daughters]]'' (1928) made her a popular [[flapper]] of the late 1920s. Her first sound film ''[[Untamed (1929 film)|Untamed]]'' (1929) was a critical and box office success.\n\nCrawford would become a highly popular actress throughout the 1930s, as a [[leading lady]] for [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]. She starred in a series of \"[[rags to riches|rags-to-riches]]\" films that were extremely popular during the [[Great Depression|Depression]]-era, most especially with women. Her popularity rivaled fellow MGM actresses, including [[Greta Garbo]], [[Norma Shearer]] and [[Jean Harlow]]. She appeared in eight movies with [[Clark Gable]], including romantic drama ''[[Possessed (1931 film)|Possessed]]'' (1931), musical film ''[[Dancing Lady]]'' (1933), romantic comedy ''[[Love on the Run (1936 film)|Love on the Run]]'' (1936) and romantic drama ''[[Strange Cargo (1940 film)|Strange Cargo]]'' (1940) among others.<!-- Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ (1925)\nThe Merry Widow (1925)\nPossessed (1931)\nDance, Fools, Dance (1931)\nLaughing Sinners (1931)\nScreen Snapshots (1932)\nDancing Lady (1933)\nForsaking All Others (1934)\nChained (1934)\nLove on the Run (1936)\nStrange Cargo (1940)\nhttp://www.imdb.com/search/title?roles=nm0001076,nm0000022&title_type=feature,tv_episode,video,tv_movie,tv_special,mini_series,documentary,game,short\n --> In 1937, she was proclaimed the first \"Queen of the Movies\" by ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine, but her popularity soon waned. After her films ''[[The Bride Wore Red]]'' (1937) and ''[[Mannequin (1937 film)|Mannequin]]'' (1938) proved to be expensive failures, in May 1938, Crawford \u2013 along with [[Greta Garbo]], [[Katharine Hepburn]], [[Fred Astaire]], [[Kay Francis]] and many others \u2013 was labeled [[Box Office Poison (magazine article)|box office poison]]; an actor whose \"box office draw is nil\".\n\nCrawford managed to make a comeback in the comedy ''[[The Women (1939 film)|The Women]]'' (1939) opposite an all-star female only cast. On July 1, 1943, Crawford left MGM and signed an exclusive contract with [[Warner Bros.|Warner Brothers]], where she became a rival of [[Bette Davis]]. After a slow start with the studio, she received critical and commercial acclaim for her performance in drama ''[[Mildred Pierce (film)|Mildred Pierce]]'' (1945). The film earned her an [[Academy Award for Best Actress]]. From 1946 to 1952, Crawford appeared in a series of critical and box office successes, including the musical drama ''[[Humoresque (1946 film)|Humoresque]]'' (1946), film noirs ''[[Possessed (1947 film)|Possessed]]'' (1947, for which she received a second Academy Award nomination) and ''[[Flamingo Road (film)|Flamingo Road]]'' (1949), drama ''[[The Damned Don't Cry]]'' (1950) and romantic comedy ''[[Goodbye, My Fancy]]'' (1951) among others. She received a third \u2013 and final \u2013 Academy Award nomination for her performance in the thriller ''[[Sudden Fear]]'' (1952).\n\nIn 1953, Crawford starred in the musical ''[[Torch Song (1953 film)|Torch Song]]'', her final film role for MGM. Her next film ''[[Johnny Guitar]]'' (1954) although not a major hit, is one of Crawford's most popular films among her fans. During the latter half of the 1950s, Crawford starred in a series of [[B-movie]]s, including romantic dramas ''[[Female on the Beach]]'' (1955) and ''[[Autumn Leaves (film)|Autumn Leaves]]'' (1956). In 1962, Crawford was teamed with [[Bette Davis]] in a film adaptation of ''[[What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? (film)|What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?]]''. The [[thriller film]] was a box office hit, and briefly revived Crawford's career. Her final film performance was in the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[science fiction film]], ''[[Trog]]'' (1970).\n\n==Filmography==\n\n===Feature films===\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size: 100%;\" border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" background: #f9f9f9;\n|+ Silent films\n|- align=\"center\"\n! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Year\n! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Title\n! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Role\n! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Director\n! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Studio\n|-\n| 1925 || ''[[Lady of the Night]]'' || Double for [[Norma Shearer]]<ref name=\"uncredited\">Uncredited</ref> || [[Monta Bell]] || [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]\n|-\n| 1925 || ''[[Proud Flesh (film)|Proud Flesh]]'' || Party Guest<ref name=\"uncredited\" /> || [[King Vidor]] || [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]\n|-\n| 1925 || ''[[A Slave of Fashion]]''<sup>\u2021</sup> || Mannequin<ref name=\"uncredited\" /> || [[Hobart Henley]] || [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]\n|-\n| 1925 || ''[[The Merry Widow (1925 film)|The Merry Widow]]'' || Ballroom Dancer<ref name=\"uncredited\" /> || [[Erich von Stroheim]] || [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]\n|-\n| 1925 || ''[[Pretty Ladies]]'' || Bobby, a Showgirl<ref name=\"lucille\" /> || [[Monta Bell]] || [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]\n|-\n| 1925 || ''[[The Circle (1925 film)|The Circle]]'' || Young Lady Catherine<ref name=\"uncredited\" /> || [[Frank Borzage]] || [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]\n|-\n| 1925 || ''[[The Midshipman]]'' || Extra<ref name=\"uncredited\" /> || [[Christy Cabanne]] || [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]\n|-\n| 1925 || ''[[The Exquisite Sinner]]''<sup>\u2021</sup> || Extra<ref name=\"uncredited\" /> || [[Josef von Sternberg]] || [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]\n|-\n| 1925 || ''[[The Big Parade]]'' || Extra<ref name=\"uncredited\" /> || [[King Vidor]] || [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]\n|-\n| 1925 || ''[[Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ (1925 film)|Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ]]'' || Chariot Race Spectator<ref name=\"uncredited\" /> || [[Fred Niblo]] || [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]\n|-\n| 1925 || ''[[Old Clothes]]'' || Mary Riley<ref name=\"lucille\">Credited as Lucille LeSueur</ref> || [[Edward F.

She appeared in several other films before she made her major breakthrough playing [[Lon Chaney]]'s love interest in the 1927 [[horror film]] ''[[The Unknown (1927 film)|The Unknown]]''. Her major success in ''[[Our Dancing Daughters]]'' (1928) made her a popular [[flapper]] of the late 1920s. Her first sound film ''[[Untamed (1929 film)|Untamed]]'' (1929) was a critical and box office success.\n\nCrawford would become a highly popular actress throughout the 1930s, as a [[leading lady]] for [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]. She starred in a series of \"[[rags to riches|rags-to-riches]]\" films that were extremely popular during the [[Great Depression|Depression]]-era, most especially with women. Her popularity rivaled fellow MGM actresses, including [[Greta Garbo]], [[Norma Shearer]] and [[Jean Harlow]]. She appeared in eight movies with [[Clark Gable]], including romantic drama ''[[Possessed (1931 film)|Possessed]]'' (1931), musical film ''[[Dancing Lady]]'' (1933), romantic comedy ''[[Love on the Run (1936 film)|Love on the Run]]'' (1936) and romantic drama ''[[Strange Cargo (1940 film)|Strange Cargo]]'' (1940) among others.<!-- Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ (1925)\nThe Merry Widow (1925)\nPossessed (1931)\nDance, Fools, Dance (1931)\nLaughing Sinners (1931)\nScreen Snapshots (1932)\nDancing Lady (1933)\nForsaking All Others (1934)\nChained (1934)\nLove on the Run (1936)\nStrange Cargo (1940)\nhttp://www.imdb.com/search/title?roles=nm0001076,nm0000022&title_type=feature,tv_episode,video,tv_movie,tv_special,mini_series,documentary,game,short\n --> In 1937, she was proclaimed the first \"Queen of the Movies\" by ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine, but her popularity soon waned. After her films ''[[The Bride Wore Red]]'' (1937) and ''[[Mannequin (1937 film)|Mannequin]]'' (1938) proved to be expensive failures, in May 1938, Crawford \u2013 along with [[Greta Garbo]], [[Katharine Hepburn]], [[Fred Astaire]], [[Kay Francis]] and many others \u2013 was labeled [[Box Office Poison (magazine article)|box office poison]]; an actor whose \"box office draw is nil\".\n\nCrawford managed to make a comeback in the comedy ''[[The Women (1939 film)|The Women]]'' (1939) opposite an all-star female only cast. On July 1, 1943, Crawford left MGM and signed an exclusive contract with [[Warner Bros.|Warner Brothers]], where she became a rival of [[Bette Davis]]. After a slow start with the studio, she received critical and commercial acclaim for her performance in drama ''[[Mildred Pierce (film)|Mildred Pierce]]'' (1945). The film earned her an [[Academy Award for Best Actress]]. From 1946 to 1952, Crawford appeared in a series of critical and box office successes, including the musical drama ''[[Humoresque (1946 film)|Humoresque]]'' (1946), film noirs ''[[Possessed (1947 film)|Possessed]]'' (1947, for which she received a second Academy Award nomination) and ''[[Flamingo Road (film)|Flamingo Road]]'' (1949), drama ''[[The Damned Don't Cry]]'' (1950) and romantic comedy ''[[Goodbye, My Fancy]]'' (1951) among others. She received a third \u2013 and final \u2013 Academy Award nomination for her performance in the thriller ''[[Sudden Fear]]'' (1952).\n\nIn 1953, Crawford starred in the musical ''[[Torch Song (1953 film)|Torch Song]]'', her final film role for MGM. Her next film ''[[Johnny Guitar]]'' (1954) although not a major hit, is one of Crawford's most popular films among her fans. During the latter half of the 1950s, Crawford starred in a series of [[B-movie]]s, including romantic dramas ''[[Female on the Beach]]'' (1955) and ''[[Autumn Leaves (film)|Autumn Leaves]]'' (1956). In 1962, Crawford was teamed with [[Bette Davis]] in a film adaptation of ''[[What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? (film)|What Ever Happened to Baby Jane?]]''. The [[thriller film]] was a box office hit, and briefly revived Crawford's career. Her final film performance was in the [[United Kingdom|British]] [[science fiction film]], ''[[Trog]]'' (1970).\n\n==Filmography==\n\n===Feature films===\n{|class=\"wikitable sortable\" style=\"font-size: 100%;\" border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" background: #f9f9f9;\n|+ Silent films\n|- align=\"center\"\n! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Year\n! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Title\n! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Role\n! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Director\n! style=\"background:#B0C4DE;\" | Studio\n|-\n| 1925 || ''[[Lady of the Night]]'' || Double for [[Norma Shearer]]<ref name=\"uncredited\">Uncredited</ref> || [[Monta Bell]] || [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]\n|-\n| 1925 || ''[[Proud Flesh (film)|Proud Flesh]]'' || Party Guest<ref name=\"uncredited\" /> || [[King Vidor]] || [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]\n|-\n| 1925 || ''[[A Slave of Fashion]]''<sup>\u2021</sup> || Mannequin<ref name=\"uncredited\" /> || [[Hobart Henley]] || [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]\n|-\n| 1925 || ''[[The Merry Widow (1925 film)|The Merry Widow]]'' || Ballroom Dancer<ref name=\"uncredited\" /> || [[Erich von Stroheim]] || [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]\n|-\n| 1925 || ''[[Pretty Ladies]]'' || Bobby, a Showgirl<ref name=\"lucille\" /> || [[Monta Bell]] || [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]\n|-\n| 1925 || ''[[The Circle (1925 film)|The Circle]]'' || Young Lady Catherine<ref name=\"uncredited\" /> || [[Frank Borzage]] || [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]\n|-\n| 1925 || ''[[The Midshipman]]'' || Extra<ref name=\"uncredited\" /> || [[Christy Cabanne]] || [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]\n|-\n| 1925 || ''[[The Exquisite Sinner]]''<sup>\u2021</sup> || Extra<ref name=\"uncredited\" /> || [[Josef von Sternberg]] || [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]\n|-\n| 1925 || ''[[The Big Parade]]'' || Extra<ref name=\"uncredited\" /> || [[King Vidor]] || [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]\n|-\n| 1925 || ''[[Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ (1925 film)|Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ]]'' || Chariot Race Spectator<ref name=\"uncredited\" /> || [[Fred Niblo]] || [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]]\n|-\n| 1925 || ''[[Old Clothes]]'' || Mary Riley<ref name=\"lucille\">Credited as Lucille LeSueur</ref> || [[Edward F.

The oldest of these originating partnerships was founded in 1849, in England, as Harding & Pullein. That same year, this firm was joined by an accountant named Frederick Whinney, who, a decade later, became a partner. With his son later working with him, the firm was renamed Whinney Smith & Whinney in 1894.<ref name=\"history\">[http://www.ey.com/GL/en/About-us/Our-history \"Ernst & Young \u2013 History\"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090715172635/http://www.ey.com/GL/en/About-us/Our-history|date=15 July 2009}}. Ernst & Young. Retrieved 9 July 2011.</ref>\n\nIn 1903, the firm '''Ernst & Ernst''' was founded in Cleveland, Ohio, by [[Alwin C. Ernst]], and his brother, Theodore Ernst. In 1906, '''Arthur Young & Co. ''' was set up by a Scotsman accountant, [[Arthur Young (accountant)|Arthur Young]], in Chicago. Starting in 1924, these two American firms became allied with prominent British firms; Young with Broads Paterson & Co.; and Ernst with the aforementioned Whinney Smith & Whinney. The latter of these two mergers spawned Anglo-American partnership '''Ernst & Whinney''' in 1979, then the fourth largest accountancy firm in the world.<ref name=\"history\" />\n\nA decade later in 1989, Ernst & Whinney merged with the fifth largest firm globally at the time, Arthur Young & Co., to create '''Ernst & Young'''.<ref>[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE2DE1E38F93BA25756C0A96F948260 \"Reports Say Arthur Young and Ernst May Merge\"].

May 1989.</ref>\n\n===Later developments===\nIn October 1997, Ernst & Young announced plans to merge its global practices with professional services network [[KPMG]], to create the largest professional services organization in the world. The announcement came on the heels of an announced merger between [[Price Waterhouse]] and [[Coopers & Lybrand]] only a month earlier. These plans were soon abandoned in February 1998, due to several factors ranging from client opposition, antitrust issues, cost problems, and the anticipated difficulty of merging the two diverse firms and cultures.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/56509.stm \"Accountancy Merger Off\"].

During this time, the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]], and various members of the investment community, began to raise concerns about a potential conflict of interests. This conflict would be brought about by firms offering both consulting and auditing services simultaneously to overlapping clients, a common practice among the \"Big Five\". In May 2000, Ernst & Young was the first of those firms to fully separate its consulting practices via a sale to the French IT services company [[Capgemini]] for $11&nbsp;billion, creating the new company Capgemini Ernst & Young, which was later renamed back to [[Capgemini]].<ref>[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9503E6D81339F932A35750C0A9669C8B63 \"Capgemini to Acquire Ernst & Young Consulting Business\"].

In 1906, '''Arthur Young & Co. ''' was set up by a Scotsman accountant, [[Arthur Young (accountant)|Arthur Young]], in Chicago. Starting in 1924, these two American firms became allied with prominent British firms; Young with Broads Paterson & Co.; and Ernst with the aforementioned Whinney Smith & Whinney. The latter of these two mergers spawned Anglo-American partnership '''Ernst & Whinney''' in 1979, then the fourth largest accountancy firm in the world.<ref name=\"history\" />\n\nA decade later in 1989, Ernst & Whinney merged with the fifth largest firm globally at the time, Arthur Young & Co., to create '''Ernst & Young'''.<ref>[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE2DE1E38F93BA25756C0A96F948260 \"Reports Say Arthur Young and Ernst May Merge\"].

May 1989.</ref>\n\n===Later developments===\nIn October 1997, Ernst & Young announced plans to merge its global practices with professional services network [[KPMG]], to create the largest professional services organization in the world. The announcement came on the heels of an announced merger between [[Price Waterhouse]] and [[Coopers & Lybrand]] only a month earlier. These plans were soon abandoned in February 1998, due to several factors ranging from client opposition, antitrust issues, cost problems, and the anticipated difficulty of merging the two diverse firms and cultures.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/56509.stm \"Accountancy Merger Off\"].

During this time, the [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]], and various members of the investment community, began to raise concerns about a potential conflict of interests. This conflict would be brought about by firms offering both consulting and auditing services simultaneously to overlapping clients, a common practice among the \"Big Five\". In May 2000, Ernst & Young was the first of those firms to fully separate its consulting practices via a sale to the French IT services company [[Capgemini]] for $11&nbsp;billion, creating the new company Capgemini Ernst & Young, which was later renamed back to [[Capgemini]].<ref>[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9503E6D81339F932A35750C0A9669C8B63 \"Capgemini to Acquire Ernst & Young Consulting Business\"].

Their time together was short, as Krist\u00edn only lived until 1714, aged 42.

After Magn\u00fas admitted to adultery with an unnamed woman working on the farm Vigur, \u00c1str\u00ed\u00f0ur left Magn\u00fas and went to live with her father at Holt. With his help, she petitioned for a divorce from Bishop [[Brynj\u00f3lfur Sveinsson]] (1605\u20131675) of Skalh\u00f3lt, who was also her paternal grandfather's half-brother. Two letters were sent to him, dated 27 and 28 February 1674, just before the end of his time as bishop. \u00c1str\u00ed\u00f0ur and Magn\u00fas were summoned to the court at the [[Althing]] in 1674 but it was still not yet settled. \u00c1str\u00ed\u00f0ur wrote again to Brynj\u00f3lfur in autumn 1674, and his reply of 12 April 1675, only four months before his death later that year, advised her not to return to Magn\u00fas. After this, the matter was taken up by Brynj\u00f3lfur's successor, Bishop [[\u00de\u00f3r\u00f0ur \u00deorl\u00e1ksson]] (1637\u20131697), and during his first visit to the Westfjords the case for divorce was considered and granted. \u00c1str\u00ed\u00f0ur later lived at M\u00fdri in nearby D\u00fdrafj\u00f6r\u00f0ur, eventually together with her daughter Krist\u00edn and son-in-law Sn\u00e6bj\u00f6rn. \u00c1str\u00ed\u00f0ur died on 30 August 1719, at the age of 73.<ref>J\u00f3hann Gunnar \u00d3lafsson, 'Magn\u00fas J\u00f3nsson \u00ed Vigur', ''Sk\u00edrnir'', 130 (1956), 107-26 (pp. 112\u201313); P\u00e1ll Eggert \u00d3lason, ''\u00cdslenskar \u00e6viskr\u00e1r: Fr\u00e1 landn\u00e1mst\u00edmum til \u00e1rsloka 1940'', 6 vols (Reykjav\u00edk: Hi\u00f0 \u00cdslenzka B\u00f3kmenntaf\u00e9lag, 1948\u201376).</ref>\n\nAfter his relationship with \u00c1str\u00ed\u00f0ur formally ended, Magn\u00fas had another child in 1681 with another mistress, Gu\u00f0bj\u00f6rg J\u00f3nsd\u00f3ttir. Gu\u00f0bj\u00f6rg was then married to J\u00f3n Sigur\u00f0sson, a farmer who later worked at Skar\u00f0 (one of Magn\u00fas J\u00f3nsson's farms, under the control of \u00d6gur) and even at Vigur itself after Magn\u00fas's death. Magn\u00fas did not, however, publicly acknowledge his paternity of the child, named Sigur\u00f0ur, until 1686. Until then, the boy was considered to be Gu\u00f0bj\u00f6rg's son together with J\u00f3n Sigur\u00f0sson. When the truth was revealed, Magn\u00fas was fined and the record of this notes that the offence was Gu\u00f0bj\u00f6rg's first, and Magn\u00fas's second. Sigur\u00f0ur Magn\u00fasson only lived to his mid-twenties, almost certainly dying in the smallpox epidemic that broke out in 1707.<ref>J\u00f3hann Gunnar \u00d3lafsson, 'Magn\u00fas J\u00f3nsson \u00ed Vigur', ''Sk\u00edrnir'', 130 (1956), 107-26 (pp. 112\u201313).</ref>\n\n==== Remarriage ====\n\nSoon after his affair with Gu\u00f0bj\u00f6rg was made known, Magn\u00fas settled on the idea of marrying a second time. He sought a royal dispensation to marry Sesselja S\u00e6mundsd\u00f3ttir (born 1673), whose father, S\u00e6mundur Magn\u00fasson, was magistrate at H\u00f3ll in [[Bolungarv\u00edk]]. Sesselja was one of seven of S\u00e6mundur's children with his second wife Solveig J\u00f3nsd\u00f3ttir. The dispensation for the marriage was issued in Denmark by [[Christian V of Denmark|King Christian V]] on 27 April 1688,<ref>J\u00f3hann Gunnar \u00d3lafsson, 'Magn\u00fas J\u00f3nsson \u00ed Vigur', ''Sk\u00edrnir'', 130 (1956), 107-26 (p. 113).</ref> when Sesselja was only 15 years of age; permission must have been sought by Magn\u00fas at least a year earlier. The dispensation reached Iceland later and was read at the Althing on 30 June 1691. The following year, 1692, the two were married, Sesselja 19 years old, and Magn\u00fas, 55. The couple did not have any children, and this marriage also seems to have been troubled as Sesselja was living again with her family only a few years later.

Two letters were sent to him, dated 27 and 28 February 1674, just before the end of his time as bishop. \u00c1str\u00ed\u00f0ur and Magn\u00fas were summoned to the court at the [[Althing]] in 1674 but it was still not yet settled. \u00c1str\u00ed\u00f0ur wrote again to Brynj\u00f3lfur in autumn 1674, and his reply of 12 April 1675, only four months before his death later that year, advised her not to return to Magn\u00fas.

Sigur\u00f0ur Magn\u00fasson only lived to his mid-twenties, almost certainly dying in the smallpox epidemic that broke out in 1707.<ref>J\u00f3hann Gunnar \u00d3lafsson, 'Magn\u00fas J\u00f3nsson \u00ed Vigur', ''Sk\u00edrnir'', 130 (1956), 107-26 (pp. 112\u201313).</ref>\n\n==== Remarriage ====\n\nSoon after his affair with Gu\u00f0bj\u00f6rg was made known, Magn\u00fas settled on the idea of marrying a second time. He sought a royal dispensation to marry Sesselja S\u00e6mundsd\u00f3ttir (born 1673), whose father, S\u00e6mundur Magn\u00fasson, was magistrate at H\u00f3ll in [[Bolungarv\u00edk]]. Sesselja was one of seven of S\u00e6mundur's children with his second wife Solveig J\u00f3nsd\u00f3ttir. The dispensation for the marriage was issued in Denmark by [[Christian V of Denmark|King Christian V]] on 27 April 1688,<ref>J\u00f3hann Gunnar \u00d3lafsson, 'Magn\u00fas J\u00f3nsson \u00ed Vigur', ''Sk\u00edrnir'', 130 (1956), 107-26 (p. 113).</ref> when Sesselja was only 15 years of age; permission must have been sought by Magn\u00fas at least a year earlier. The dispensation reached Iceland later and was read at the Althing on 30 June 1691. The following year, 1692, the two were married, Sesselja 19 years old, and Magn\u00fas, 55. The couple did not have any children, and this marriage also seems to have been troubled as Sesselja was living again with her family only a few years later. Her uncle \u00c1rni Magn\u00fasson (c. 1625\u20131698) of H\u00f3ll in Bolungarv\u00edk petitioned to take her into his care.<ref>Magn\u00fas Magn\u00fasson, \u2018Eyrarann\u00e1ll 1551\u20131703\u2019, ed. by Hannes \u00deorsteinnson, in ''Ann\u00e1lar 1400\u20131800'', 8 vols (Reykjav\u00edk: Hi\u00f0 \u00edslenzka b\u00f3kmenntaf\u00e9lag, 1922\u20132003), III (1933\u201338), pp. 225\u2013420 (p. 382).</ref> After his death, Sesselja appears to have lived with her father again, with her brother Sigmundur (c. 1675\u2013c. 1737) as her legal guardian.<ref>J\u00f3hann Gunnar \u00d3lafsson, 'Magn\u00fas J\u00f3nsson \u00ed Vigur', ''Sk\u00edrnir'', 130 (1956), 107-26 (p. 113)</ref>\n\n== Patronage of manuscripts ==\n\nAt the time of his death, Magn\u00fas had amassed an extensive library of Icelandic and foreign texts from medieval tales and sagas of all literary genres, to modern works on geography and ethnography that were being printed in early modern Europe, to poetry composed by his own family members.<ref>J\u00f3n Helgason, ed., ''Kv\u00e6\u00f0ab\u00f3k \u00far Vigur'', 2 vols, \u00cdslenzk rit s\u00ed\u00f0ari alda, 2 (Copenhagen: Hi\u00f0 \u00edslenzka fr\u00e6\u00f0af\u00e9lag, 1955); J\u00f3hann Gunnar \u00d3lafsson, 'Magn\u00fas J\u00f3nsson \u00ed Vigur', ''Sk\u00edrnir'', 130 (1956), 107-26 (pp. 113\u201326).</ref>\n\nThe manuscripts associated with Magn\u00fas J\u00f3nsson \u00ed Vigur are significant because the texts preserved in them are thought to represent a snapshot of the literature available in Iceland at the time, and to provide insight into the country's early modern literary landscape and manuscript production practices: it has been said of just one of the manuscripts commissioned by Magn\u00fas J\u00f3nsson (AM 148 8vo, the famous miscellany known as ''Kv\u00e6\u00f0ab\u00f3k \u00far Vigur''), that it \"shows as though in a cross-section the type of poetry, both ancient and new, thought to be most current in Iceland in the late 17th century\".<ref>J\u00f3n Helgason, ed., ''Kv\u00e6\u00f0ab\u00f3k \u00far Vigur'', 2 vols, \u00cdslenzk rit s\u00ed\u00f0ari alda, 2 (Copenhagen: Hi\u00f0 \u00edslenzka fr\u00e6\u00f0af\u00e9lag, 1955), II: 15.</ref>\n\nMany of the manuscripts in Magn\u00fas's library were copied by one or more scribes who worked in his service.<ref>Peter Springborg, \u2018Antiqv\u00e6 histori\u00e6 lepores \u2013 om ren\u00e6ssancen i den islandske h\u00e5ndskriftproduktion i 1600-tallet\u2019, ''Gardar'', 8 (1977), 53\u201389.</ref> However, Magn\u00fas himself also copied texts in several of the manuscripts in his library.

{"title_page": "Battlestar Galactica (comics)", "text_new": "{{short description|Comics}}\n{{italic title}}\n''[[Battlestar Galactica]]'' has been adapted to the [[comic book]] format since its inception, with no less than six publishers to date taking on the project of relating the story of the Colonial Fleet and their adversaries, the [[Cylon (Battlestar Galactica)|Cylons]], at different points.\n\n==Original continuity adaptations==\n[[Image:Marvelbg1.jpg|thumb|250px|Cover of the first issue of Marvel's monthly ''Battlestar Galactica'' comic book]]\n\n=== Marvel Comics ===\n{{POV-section|date=July 2015}}\n\nThe comic book ''Battlestar Galactica'', based on the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] television series of the same name, was published monthly by [[Marvel Comics]] from March 1979 through January 1981, and lasted 23 issues.\n\nAlthough there were other attempts to adapt ''Battlestar Galactica'' into a comic book format, the Marvel series is considered by many to have been the most successful in terms of run, sales, and content.\n\nThis was accomplished against some notable odds. Although [[Roger McKenzie (comics)|Roger McKenzie]] was most often the writer, and [[Walt Simonson]] the most regular artist, the book also had a heavy rotation of guest writers and artists.\n\nMarvel Comics\u2019 began its adaptation of ''Battlestar Galactica'' with ''[[Marvel Comics Super Special|Marvel Super Special]]'' #8, a magazine format comic written by Roger McKenzie and drawn by [[Ernie Col\u00f3n]] which was released as a tie-in to the start of the series. Based on an early script of the three hour series premiere \"Saga of a Star World\", this adaptation, which gave a relatively short treatment to the third hour, was also released in a tabloid format<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comics.org/issue/31796/|title=GCD :: Issue :: Marvel Super Special #8 [tabloid]|website=www.comics.org}}</ref> and then later as a paperback as well. The tabloid version was also printed by [[Whitman Comics]]. Its success led Marvel to print a regular monthly comic depicting the adventures of the ragtag fleet.\n\nWhen the regular run of Marvel's ''Battlestar Galactica'' comic book began some months later, the Super Special adaptation was expanded by several pages, and provided the material for the first three issues of the comic.\n\nThe direct adaptation of the series continued in issues #4 and #5 which chronicled the adventures depicted in the two part television episode \"Lost Planet of the Gods\". Roger McKenzie continued as scripter, with Walter Simonson now providing the art.\n\nWith issue #6, the TV adaptations ceased, and Marvel's team began to create new stories about the characters of the ''Battlestar Galactica'' universe, picking up from where issue #5 left off. From this point, both in terms of story content and the narrative arc, Marvel's ''Battlestar Galactica'' does deviate somewhat from the televised adventures. Marvel's contract with [[Universal Studios]] specifically did not allow them to use anything from the television series that followed \"Lost Planet of the Gods\". Despite this, Marvel made a conscious decision to continue the story with their own vision of how the series would progress, and so presents an interesting interpretation of ''Galactica'' \u2013 through a Marvel paradigm. This adaption more closely followed the novelization of the two-hour movie, ''Saga of a Star World,'' than what was seen on ABC television. Also, some panels depicted a likeness of Lt. Starbuck for scenes presenting Captain Apollo. These were corrected in the re-print version, seen in the original comic series.\n\nAlthough the run of the ''Battlestar Galactica'' comic coincided with the broadcast of the short-lived ''Galactica'' sequel series, ''[[Galactica 1980]]'' on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], the newer program was never referred to in the pages of the comic, apart from the letters page, and no attempts were made to construct the comic with the events of ''Galactica 1980'' as a foreseen plot outcome.\n\nIn addition, much of the comic's run took place in the magnetic void which the rag tag fleet encountered in the TV episode \"Lost Planet of the Gods\". In the end of the TV episode, the fleet moves back into normal space, leaving the void behind, but in the comics the ragtag fleet remains in the void beginning in issue #4, with the fleet finally returning to regular space in issue #14. This makes placing the episodes within the span of the TV series difficult, since much of the action could be surmised to have taken place between \"Lost Planet of the Gods\" and \"Lost Warrior\".\n\nIn terms of tone, many of the ''Galactica'' comics had classic horror elements, which was a theme visited in only a couple episodes of the TV series, as exemplified by the evil Ovions of \"Saga of a Star World\". An incomplete list of monsters from the comic series would include a space [[vampire]] (issue #9), a carnivorous planet (issue #10), alien vermin (issue #15), a crewmember who transforms into a red ape (issues #17 and #18) and a monstrous [[shapeshifting|shapeshifter]] (issue #21). Even the menacing and relentless Cylon Mark III in issue #16 owes as much of his origin to horror elements as he does to science fiction.   Taken as a whole, Marvel's ''Galactica'' is somewhat darker in tone than the series, but this not-so-subtle paranoia is arguable truer to the initial premise of the series than were some of the latter episodes of the television program.\n\nNotably, the writers of the ''Galactica'' comic were quite willing to remove key characters from the dramatic mix for periods of time. From issues #6 to #12, Commander Adama is placed within a machine to help him remember the ancient writings he briefly saw on Kobol and, although we do spend some time in his dreams, he is effectively removed from commanding the ''Galactica'' for several issues, which of course sets up its own dramatic tension.\n\nAnother character who leaves the series for a while is Starbuck, as part of perhaps the most effective story arc in the series. In this plotline, the fleet stumbles upon Scavenger World, the dominion of the female space pirate Eurayle, who makes a deal to spare the Colonials if she can keep Starbuck at her side. The interactions between Starbuck and Eurayle are memorable, with a satisfying conclusion in a tremendous battle (issue #13). At the end of the tale, Starbuck remains with Eurayle, and the fleet moves on without him, setting up his triumphant return in issues #19 and #20.\n\nUnlike both television series, the ''Galactica'' comic actually had a planned ending, with a series of plot devices being wound up in the final two part story of issues #22 and #23. In the course of solving a mystery, Lieutenant Jolly finds adventure and romance and helps in figuring out the long sought coordinates for Earth. A tongue in cheek adventure ably drawn and scripted by Walt Simonson this plotline provided a strong end for a memorable series. Presumedly, the final events of the Marvel Comic series presents the Battlestar Galactica along with rag tag fleet leaping toward the Milky Way Galaxy, where it will resume events in the TV series, in search of the lost 13th Colony known as Earth. This is the first time anywhere that the Galactica - until the new Re-Imagined Series on the Sci-Fi Channel - and the Colonial Fleet is shown leaping into hyperspace.\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|+Marvel Comics issues\n| Issue\n| Title\n| Writer\n| Penciller\n| Cover\n| Notes\n|-\n| '''#1'''\n| Battlestar Galactica\n|\n|\n|\n| adapts [[Saga of a Star World|episode 1]]\n|-\n| '''#2'''\n| Exodus\n|\n|\n|\n| adapts [[Saga of a Star World|episode 2]]\n|-\n| '''#3'''\n| Death Trap\n|\n|\n|\n| adapts [[Saga of a Star World|episode 3]]\n|-\n| '''#4'''\n|  The Lost Gods of Kobol\n|\n|\n|\n| adapts [[Lost Planet of the Gods|episode 4]]\n|-\n| '''#5'''\n| The Lost Gods of Kobol: Part Two - A Death in the Family\n|\n|\n|\n| adapts [[Lost Planet of the Gods|episode 5]]\n|-\n| '''#6'''\n| The Memory Machine\n|\n|\n|\n| Beginning of Memory Machine story arc<br>(lasts through Issue #12)\n|-\n| '''#7'''\n| All Things Past and Present\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n| '''#8'''\n| Shuttle-Diplomacy\n|\n|\n|\n|Flashback story\n|-\n| '''#9'''\n| Space-Mimic\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n| '''#10'''\n| This Planet Hungers\n|\n|\n|\n|Flashback story\n|-\n| '''#11'''\n| Scavenge World\n|\n|\n|\n| rowspan=\"3\" colspan=\"2\"|Scavenge World story arc/<br>Departure of Starbuck\n|-\n| '''#12'''\n| The Trap\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n| '''#13'''\n| Collision Course\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n| '''#14'''\n| Trial and Error\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n| '''#15'''\n| Derelict\n|\n|\n|\n|Flashback story\n|-\n| '''#16'''\n| Berserker\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n| '''#17'''\n| Ape and Essence\n|\n|\n|\n| rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"2\"|Two-issue story arc\n|-\n| '''#18'''\n| Forbidden Fruit\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n| '''#19'''\n| The Daring Escape of the Space Cowboy\n|\n|\n|\n| rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"2\"|Return of Starbuck\n|-\n| '''#20'''\n| Hell Hath No Fury\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n| '''#21'''\n| A World For the Killing\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n| '''#22'''\n| Black is the Color of My True Love's Hair\n|\n|\n|\n| rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"2\"|Series-ending story arc\n|-\n| '''#23'''\n| The Last Hiding Place\n|\n|\n|\n|}\n\n==== Reprints and compilations ====\n* ''Marvel Super Special''  #8: Battlestar Galactica\n* ''Marvel Illustrated Book: BSG'', Volume I\n* ''Marvel Illustrated Book: BSG'', Volume II\n* ''Star Heroes Pocket Books'' #1-11\n* ''Star Heroes Winter Special''\n* ''Saga of a Star World'' (Titan Press)\n* ''The Memory Machine'' (Titan Press)\n\n=== ''Look-In'' ===\nThis children's magazine published a serialized ''BSG'' strip from October 20, 1979, to October 11, 1980.

Ignoring the storyline of the much derided [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] sequel series ''Galactica 1980'', this tale followed the crew as they finally approached Earth, led by Commander Apollo, who had succeeded his father.\n\nThis miniseries was popular enough that it spawned a group of sequels including \"Apollo's Journey\", \"The Enemy Within\", and \"Starbuck\" all published as three or four issue series in 1995 through early 1996. \"Journey's End\", the final four issue series, broke many ''Galactica'' conventions,  and contains the memorable sequence of the ''Galactica'' travelling through time back to the Cylon attack on Caprica. After the publishing of the ''Battlestar Galactica Compendium'' in early 1997 however, the steam ran out of this endeavor and Maximum announced it would no longer be publishing ''Galactica'' based comics.\n\n'''Miniseries'''\n* The War of Eden #1-4 (also collected in [[Trade paperback (comics)|trade paperback]] format {{ISBN|1-888610-01-8}} in December 1995)\n* The Enemy Within #1-3\n* Starbuck #1-3\n* Apollo's Journey 1-3 (issue #3 was published with 2 alternative covers)\n* Journey's End #1-4\n\n'''Asylum (monthly anthology series)'''\n* '''Issue 1''':  Baptism of Fire, Part 1\n* '''Issue 2''':  Baptism of Fire, Part 2\n* '''Issue 3''':  Baptism of Fire, Part 3\n* '''Issue 4''':  Athena's Quest, Part 1 (originally titled Apollo's Quest)\n* '''Issue 5''':  Athena's Quest, Part 2 (originally titled Apollo's Quest)\n* (No BSG story in issue 6)\n* '''Issue 7''':  Athena's Quest, Part 3 (originally titled Apollo's Quest)\n* '''Issue 8''':  First Date\n* (No BSG story in issue 9)\n* '''Issue 10''':  The Rebirth of Cy, Part 1 (unfinished)\n* (No BSG story in issue 11)\n\n'''Compilations'''\n* ''Battlestar Galactica: The Compendium''\n(Collects Baptism of Fire and The Rebirth of Cy)\n* ''Battlestar Galactica: Special Edition''\n(Collects Athena's Quest)\n\n=== Realm Press ===\nIn 1998, Realm Press brought Battlestar Galactica back to comics again beginning with their \"Battlestar Galactica Search for Sanctuary\" single issue special.

Although [[Roger McKenzie (comics)|Roger McKenzie]] was most often the writer, and [[Walt Simonson]] the most regular artist, the book also had a heavy rotation of guest writers and artists.\n\nMarvel Comics\u2019 began its adaptation of ''Battlestar Galactica'' with ''[[Marvel Comics Super Special|Marvel Super Special]]'' #8, a magazine format comic written by Roger McKenzie and drawn by [[Ernie Col\u00f3n]] which was released as a tie-in to the start of the series. Based on an early script of the three hour series premiere \"Saga of a Star World\", this adaptation, which gave a relatively short treatment to the third hour, was also released in a tabloid format<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.comics.org/issue/31796/|title=GCD :: Issue :: Marvel Super Special #8 [tabloid]|website=www.comics.org}}</ref> and then later as a paperback as well. The tabloid version was also printed by [[Whitman Comics]]. Its success led Marvel to print a regular monthly comic depicting the adventures of the ragtag fleet.\n\nWhen the regular run of Marvel's ''Battlestar Galactica'' comic book began some months later, the Super Special adaptation was expanded by several pages, and provided the material for the first three issues of the comic.\n\nThe direct adaptation of the series continued in issues #4 and #5 which chronicled the adventures depicted in the two part television episode \"Lost Planet of the Gods\". Roger McKenzie continued as scripter, with Walter Simonson now providing the art.\n\nWith issue #6, the TV adaptations ceased, and Marvel's team began to create new stories about the characters of the ''Battlestar Galactica'' universe, picking up from where issue #5 left off. From this point, both in terms of story content and the narrative arc, Marvel's ''Battlestar Galactica'' does deviate somewhat from the televised adventures. Marvel's contract with [[Universal Studios]] specifically did not allow them to use anything from the television series that followed \"Lost Planet of the Gods\". Despite this, Marvel made a conscious decision to continue the story with their own vision of how the series would progress, and so presents an interesting interpretation of ''Galactica'' \u2013 through a Marvel paradigm. This adaption more closely followed the novelization of the two-hour movie, ''Saga of a Star World,'' than what was seen on ABC television. Also, some panels depicted a likeness of Lt. Starbuck for scenes presenting Captain Apollo. These were corrected in the re-print version, seen in the original comic series.\n\nAlthough the run of the ''Battlestar Galactica'' comic coincided with the broadcast of the short-lived ''Galactica'' sequel series, ''[[Galactica 1980]]'' on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]], the newer program was never referred to in the pages of the comic, apart from the letters page, and no attempts were made to construct the comic with the events of ''Galactica 1980'' as a foreseen plot outcome.\n\nIn addition, much of the comic's run took place in the magnetic void which the rag tag fleet encountered in the TV episode \"Lost Planet of the Gods\". In the end of the TV episode, the fleet moves back into normal space, leaving the void behind, but in the comics the ragtag fleet remains in the void beginning in issue #4, with the fleet finally returning to regular space in issue #14. This makes placing the episodes within the span of the TV series difficult, since much of the action could be surmised to have taken place between \"Lost Planet of the Gods\" and \"Lost Warrior\".\n\nIn terms of tone, many of the ''Galactica'' comics had classic horror elements, which was a theme visited in only a couple episodes of the TV series, as exemplified by the evil Ovions of \"Saga of a Star World\". An incomplete list of monsters from the comic series would include a space [[vampire]] (issue #9), a carnivorous planet (issue #10), alien vermin (issue #15), a crewmember who transforms into a red ape (issues #17 and #18) and a monstrous [[shapeshifting|shapeshifter]] (issue #21). Even the menacing and relentless Cylon Mark III in issue #16 owes as much of his origin to horror elements as he does to science fiction.   Taken as a whole, Marvel's ''Galactica'' is somewhat darker in tone than the series, but this not-so-subtle paranoia is arguable truer to the initial premise of the series than were some of the latter episodes of the television program.\n\nNotably, the writers of the ''Galactica'' comic were quite willing to remove key characters from the dramatic mix for periods of time. From issues #6 to #12, Commander Adama is placed within a machine to help him remember the ancient writings he briefly saw on Kobol and, although we do spend some time in his dreams, he is effectively removed from commanding the ''Galactica'' for several issues, which of course sets up its own dramatic tension.\n\nAnother character who leaves the series for a while is Starbuck, as part of perhaps the most effective story arc in the series. In this plotline, the fleet stumbles upon Scavenger World, the dominion of the female space pirate Eurayle, who makes a deal to spare the Colonials if she can keep Starbuck at her side. The interactions between Starbuck and Eurayle are memorable, with a satisfying conclusion in a tremendous battle (issue #13). At the end of the tale, Starbuck remains with Eurayle, and the fleet moves on without him, setting up his triumphant return in issues #19 and #20.\n\nUnlike both television series, the ''Galactica'' comic actually had a planned ending, with a series of plot devices being wound up in the final two part story of issues #22 and #23. In the course of solving a mystery, Lieutenant Jolly finds adventure and romance and helps in figuring out the long sought coordinates for Earth. A tongue in cheek adventure ably drawn and scripted by Walt Simonson this plotline provided a strong end for a memorable series. Presumedly, the final events of the Marvel Comic series presents the Battlestar Galactica along with rag tag fleet leaping toward the Milky Way Galaxy, where it will resume events in the TV series, in search of the lost 13th Colony known as Earth. This is the first time anywhere that the Galactica - until the new Re-Imagined Series on the Sci-Fi Channel - and the Colonial Fleet is shown leaping into hyperspace.\n\n==== Issue breakdown ====\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n| Issue\n| Title\n| Writer\n| Penciller\n| Cover\n| Notes\n|-\n| '''#1'''\n| Battlestar Galactica\n|\n|\n|\n| adapts [[Saga of a Star World|episode 1]]\n|-\n| '''#2'''\n| Exodus\n|\n|\n|\n| adapts [[Saga of a Star World|episode 2]]\n|-\n| '''#3'''\n| Death Trap\n|\n|\n|\n| adapts [[Saga of a Star World|episode 3]]\n|-\n| '''#4'''\n|  The Lost Gods of Kobol\n|\n|\n|\n| adapts [[Lost Planet of the Gods|episode 4]]\n|-\n| '''#5'''\n| The Lost Gods of Kobol: Part Two - A Death in the Family\n|\n|\n|\n| adapts [[Lost Planet of the Gods|episode 5]]\n|-\n| '''#6'''\n| The Memory Machine\n|\n|\n|\n| Beginning of Memory Machine story arc<br>(lasts through Issue #12)\n|-\n| '''#7'''\n| All Things Past and Present\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n| '''#8'''\n| Shuttle-Diplomacy\n|\n|\n|\n|Flashback story\n|-\n| '''#9'''\n| Space-Mimic\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n| '''#10'''\n| This Planet Hungers\n|\n|\n|\n|Flashback story\n|-\n| '''#11'''\n| Scavenge World\n|\n|\n|\n| rowspan=\"3\" colspan=\"2\"|Scavenge World story arc/<br>Departure of Starbuck\n|-\n| '''#12'''\n| The Trap\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n| '''#13'''\n| Collision Course\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n| '''#14'''\n| Trial and Error\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n| '''#15'''\n| Derelict\n|\n|\n|\n|Flashback story\n|-\n| '''#16'''\n| Berserker\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n| '''#17'''\n| Ape and Essence\n|\n|\n|\n| rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"2\"|Two-issue story arc\n|-\n| '''#18'''\n| Forbidden Fruit\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n| '''#19'''\n| The Daring Escape of the Space Cowboy\n|\n|\n|\n| rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"2\"|Return of Starbuck\n|-\n| '''#20'''\n| Hell Hath No Fury\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n| '''#21'''\n| A World For the Killing\n|\n|\n|\n|\n|-\n| '''#22'''\n| Black is the Color of My True Love's Hair\n|\n|\n|\n| rowspan=\"2\" colspan=\"2\"|Series-ending story arc\n|-\n| '''#23'''\n| The Last Hiding Place\n|\n|\n|\n|}\n\n==== Reprints / Compilations ====\n* ''Marvel Super Special''  #8: Battlestar Galactica\n* ''Marvel Illustrated Book: BSG'', Volume I\n* ''Marvel Illustrated Book: BSG'', Volume II\n* ''Star Heroes Pocket Books'' #1-11\n* ''Star Heroes Winter Special''\n* ''Saga of a Star World'' (Titan Press)\n* ''The Memory Machine'' (Titan Press)\n\n=== Look-In Magazine ===\nThis children's magazine published a serialized ''BSG'' strip from October 20, 1979, to October 11, 1980.
