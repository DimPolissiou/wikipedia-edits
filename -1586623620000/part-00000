The UK arm of [[Poale Zion]], a Jewish workers movement, called ''Poale Zion (Great Britain)'', later the [[Jewish Labour Movement]], affiliated to the Labour Party in 1920.{{efn|There was a division of labour between Poale Zion and [[Chaim Weizmann]], the leader of the general Zionist movement, who lobbied in Britain for support for a Jewish state on the grounds that the latter would conform to the liberal capitalist model that would serve the interests of the British Empire: 'The British, he wrote in 1924, \"have come to realize that they have very little to lean on for protection of the jugular vein of the British Empire, except a Palestine peacefully developed and economically and politically stable. They begin to realize that such a Palestine can only be brought into effect if Jewish enterprise is allowed free course in that country\".'{{sfn|Kelemen|2012|p=3}}}} Many prominent Labour leaders had an affinity with the goals of [[Labour Zionism]], but were initially reluctant to press for parliamentary support for relieving obstacles to Jewish immigration to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], given the party's commitment to an [[Anti-imperialism|anti-imperialistic policy]]. In 1920, they gave unqualified support to both the [[Balfour Declaration]] and the British [[Mandate for Palestine]].{{sfn|Gorny|2013|pp=26\u201328}} The basic principles that evolved stressed (a) gradual growth of a Jewish homeland through selective immigration; (b) the formation of a [[One-state solution|binational society]] and (c) criticism of Zionism's [[Separatism|separatist agenda]].{{sfn|Gorny|2013|p=89}}\n\n===Support for Israel===\nGenerally, Labour support for Israel continued, in the expectancy that the Labour Zionist strand in Jewish state-building would lead to socialism and development in the Middle East generally. [[Ernest Bevin]], Britain's [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] from 1945 to 1951, was critical of Zionist goals; he argued that Jews should be convinced to resettle in Europe, and said that Americans supported Jewish immigration to Palestine because \"they did not want too many Jews in New York\". Bevin also voiced antisemitic canards between Jews and finance, as well as communism. There is no evidence that this affected his political decisions.{{sfn|Weiler|2016|pp=75,170ff}}{{efn|British officials of the Mandatory administration dealing with the conflicting demands of the Arab and Jewish communities were conscious of the potential international reverberation of their decisions particularly in the US and in Muslim countries. They were inclined to see the Zionists as more troublesome, endlessly petitioning with new demands and calling the administration to account on the basis of the Mandate and the Balfour Declaration. If the Zionist movement's demand in Palestine was turned down at the first port of call its representatives were likely to raise the matter at a higher level, if necessary all the way up the chain of command to ministers in London. With antisemitism endemic among colonial officials, as among all sections of British society, they often expressed their resentment at attempts to outmanoeuvre them in racist terms. Yet, if this was an overtly hostile form of racism by comparison with the apparently more benign, paternalistic and version directed at the Arabs, British rule nonetheless maintained the political and economic framework that favoured Jewish nation-building at the expense of Arab interests.'{{sfn|Kelemen|2012|p=5}}}}\n\n===Growing sympathy for Palestine===\n[[Aberystwyth University]]'s James R. Vaughn says the rise of a radical [[anti-Zionism]] in the Labour Party started with the creation of the Labour Middle East Council in 1969 by [[Christopher Mayhew]].{{sfn|Vaughn|2015|pp=1\u201325}}{{efn|Both Bevin and Mayhew (the latter later defected to the Liberal Party), had been subject to death threats by the [[Stern Gang]] in the 1940s.{{sfn|Vaughn|2015|p=4}}}} [[Dave Rich]] concurs that Mayhew founded the council in order to change the \"pro-Israel\" position of the Labour Party{{sfn|Rich|2016|p=26}} and references the influence of pro-Palestinian activists within the [[National League of Young Liberals|Young Liberals]].{{sfn|Rich|2018|p=98}}\n\nBy the 1980s, with the election of [[Menachem Begin]]'s [[Likud]] party, the emergence of [[Religious nationalism|messianic nationalism]], [[Neoliberalism|neo-liberal economic reforms]], the [[Israeli occupation of the West Bank|occupation of the West Bank]] and of the [[Gaza Strip]], and the decline of the [[Israeli Labor Party]], socialism declined in Israel. These factors contributed to falling Labour support for Israel, at the same time as there was growing sympathy for Palestinian aspirations for statehood.{{sfn|Kelemen|2012|p=2}} According to June Edmunds, Lecturer in Sociology of the [[University of Sussex]], the party's leadership was initially supportive of Israel but shifted to support Palestine in the early 1980s, although the membership did not; later challenges to this shift eventually resulted in a more balanced view of both sides and broad support for a [[two-state solution]].<ref name=EdmundsJune>[https://doi.org/10.1093/tcbh/11.1.23 June Edmunds; \"The Evolution of British Labour Party Policy on Israel from 1967 to the Intifada\", ''Twentieth Century British History'', Volume 11, Issue 1, 1 January 2000, Pages 23\u201341]</ref> Edmunds credits the shift towards Palestine aspirations to more moderate appeals by Palestinians, a sharp shift to the right in Israeli politics and an increase in anti-colonial politics among the left.<ref name=EdmundsJune />\n\n[[Richard Seymour (writer)|Richard Seymour]] wrote in 2018 that \"Palestinian rights have been a growing concern in the British Left since the 1982 [[Sabra and Shatila massacre]]\"{{sfn|Seymour|2018b}} when \"the British trade union movement and the Labour Party began to break with Israel in response\".{{sfn|Seymour|2018a}} The Labour Committee on Palestine was formed in June 1982 to challenge the Labour Middle East Council, which supported a two-state solution, and to oppose the \"Zionist state as racist, exclusivist, expansionist and a direct agency of imperialism\". Labour politicians [[Ken Livingstone]] of the [[Greater London Council]] and [[Ted Knight (politician)|Ted Knight]] of the [[Lambeth London Borough Council]] were early supporters; the chair was former British Anti-Zionist Organization (BAZO) activist Tony Greenstein.{{sfn|Rich|2016|p=143}} The new Committee backed a resolution at the 1982 [[Labour Party Conference (UK)|Labour Party Conference]] to recognise the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] (PLO) as the \"sole legitimate representative of the Palestinian people\", which passed at the Conference, \"embarrassing\" the Party leadership.{{sfn|Rich|2016|p=144}}\n\nAntisemitic attitudes are said to have been rare in the Labour Party in the 1980s.{{sfn|Rich|2018}}{{sfn|Hirsh|2017}} In his 2012 book, ''The British Left and Zionism: History of a Divorce'', [[Manchester University]]'s Paul Kelemen ascribed the shift in Labour's views to Israel's increasingly right-leaning politics and to the left's opposition to the [[Israeli-occupied territories|Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza]]. He found no evidence that antisemitism played a role in the left's changing perceptions of the Israeli Palestinian conflict in that period.{{sfn|Kelemen|2012|p=185}}{{sfn|Kolpinskaya|2014|p=450}} Daniel L. Staetsky, a senior research fellow for the [[Institute for Jewish Policy Research]], stated in his 2017 study ''Antisemitism in Contemporary Great Britain: A Study of Attitudes Towards Jews and Israel'' that, in the 1980s, parts of the political left assumed strong pro-Palestinian and anti-Israel positions, and faced accusations of antisemitism within the Labour Party.{{sfn|Staetsky|2017|p=42}} He found that anti-Israeli positions did not correlate generally with antisemitism, since the majority of those surveyed who were critical of Israel did not espouse an antisemitic attitude<ref>{{harvnb|Staetsky|2017|p=66}} \"We have discovered that anti-Israel attitudes are not, as a general rule, antisemitic. This is to say that a significant proportion of those who hold anti-Israel attitudes, a majority in fact, do not espouse any antisemitic attitudes\"</ref> and that antisemitism on the left was no higher than that of the general population.<ref>{{harvnb|Staetsky|2017|p=6}} 'Levels of antisemitism among those on the left-wing of the political spectrum, including the far-left, are indistinguishable from those found in the general population. Yet, all parts of those on the left of the political spectrum \u2013 including the 'slightly left-of-centre,' the 'fairly left-wing' and the 'very left-wing' \u2013 exhibit higher levels of anti-Israelism than average. The most antisemitic group on the political spectrum consists of those who identify as very right-wing: the presence of antisemitic attitudes in this group is two to four times higher compared to the general population.

It could be good for Israel as well.\"{{sfn|Levy|2018}} In November 2019, Levy wrote \"The new and efficient strategy of Israel and the Zionist establishment brands every seeker of justice as an anti-Semite, and any criticism of Israel as hatred of Jews.

The UK arm of [[Poale Zion]], a Jewish workers movement, called ''Poale Zion (Great Britain)'', later the [[Jewish Labour Movement]], affiliated to the Labour Party in 1920.{{efn|There was a division of labour between Poale Zion and [[Chaim Weizmann]], the leader of the general Zionist movement, who lobbied in Britain for support for a Jewish state on the grounds that the latter would conform to the liberal capitalist model that would serve the interests of the British Empire: 'The British, he wrote in 1924, \"have come to realize that they have very little to lean on for protection of the jugular vein of the British Empire, except a Palestine peacefully developed and economically and politically stable. They begin to realize that such a Palestine can only be brought into effect if Jewish enterprise is allowed free course in that country\".'{{sfn|Kelemen|2012|p=3}}}} Many prominent Labour leaders had an affinity with the goals of [[Labour Zionism]], but were initially reluctant to press for parliamentary support for relieving obstacles to Jewish immigration to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]], given the party's commitment to an [[Anti-imperialism|anti-imperialistic policy]]. In 1920, they gave unqualified support to both the [[Balfour Declaration]] and the British [[Mandate for Palestine]].{{sfn|Gorny|2013|pp=26\u201328}} The basic principles that evolved stressed (a) gradual growth of a Jewish homeland through selective immigration; (b) the formation of a [[One-state solution|binational society]] and (c) criticism of Zionism's [[Separatism|separatist agenda]].{{sfn|Gorny|2013|p=89}}\n\n===Support for Israel===\nGenerally, Labour support for Israel continued, in the expectancy that the Labour Zionist strand in Jewish state-building would lead to socialism and development in the Middle East generally. [[Ernest Bevin]], Britain's [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] from 1945 to 1951, was critical of Zionist goals; he argued that Jews should be convinced to resettle in Europe, and said that Americans supported Jewish immigration to Palestine because \"they did not want too many Jews in New York\". Bevin also voiced antisemitic canards between Jews and finance, as well as communism. There is no evidence that this affected his political decisions.{{sfn|Weiler|2016|pp=75,170ff}}{{efn|British officials of the Mandatory administration dealing with the conflicting demands of the Arab and Jewish communities were conscious of the potential international reverberation of their decisions particularly in the US and in Muslim countries. They were inclined to see the Zionists as more troublesome, endlessly petitioning with new demands and calling the administration to account on the basis of the Mandate and the Balfour Declaration. If the Zionist movement's demand in Palestine was turned down at the first port of call its representatives were likely to raise the matter at a higher level, if necessary all the way up the chain of command to ministers in London. With antisemitism endemic among colonial officials, as among all sections of British society, they often expressed their resentment at attempts to outmanoeuvre them in racist terms. Yet, if this was an overtly hostile form of racism by comparison with the apparently more benign, paternalistic and version directed at the Arabs, British rule nonetheless maintained the political and economic framework that favoured Jewish nation-building at the expense of Arab interests.'{{sfn|Kelemen|2012|p=5}}}}\n\n===Growing sympathy for Palestine===\n[[Aberystwyth University]]'s James R. Vaughn says the rise of a radical [[anti-Zionism]] in the Labour Party started with the creation of the Labour Middle East Council in 1969 by [[Christopher Mayhew]].{{sfn|Vaughn|2015|pp=1\u201325}}{{efn|Both Bevin and Mayhew (the latter later defected to the Liberal Party), had been subject to death threats by the [[Stern Gang]] in the 1940s.{{sfn|Vaughn|2015|p=4}}}} [[Dave Rich]] concurs that Mayhew founded the council in order to change the \"pro-Israel\" position of the Labour Party{{sfn|Rich|2016|p=26}} and references the influence of pro-Palestinian activists within the [[National League of Young Liberals|Young Liberals]].{{sfn|Rich|2018|p=98}}\n\nBy the 1980s, with the election of [[Menachem Begin]]'s [[Likud]] party, the emergence of [[Religious nationalism|messianic nationalism]], [[Neoliberalism|neo-liberal economic reforms]], the [[Israeli occupation of the West Bank|occupation of the West Bank]] and of the [[Gaza Strip]], and the decline of the [[Israeli Labor Party]], socialism declined in Israel.

'''Agariyas''', a community carrying out this Herculean task temporarily settles in this vast land and dig many wells to pump out the salty waters and fill-up the square-shaped fields, the natural climate conditions allow evaporation of the water and leave white crystals of salt. Harvesting seasons begin in the winter season to collect the raw salt from the fields, this process results in a collection of around 15 tons of salt with hard work of 15 days by the workers for a meagre sum of money.

The area which is dry during summers ranging from October\u2013June, However, with the outset of monsoon, the fresh waters from [[Banas River|Banas]], [[Sarasvati River|Saraswati]] and [[Machchhu River|Machchu]] mix with the salty waters of Gulf of Kutch, This brings in an enormous influx of Ginger prawn juveniles into the Rann of Kutch, which is exploited in mass scale. Juveniles of Ginger Prawn which are also known as \u201cSurajbari\" prawns as fish processing units in [[Gujarat]] procure them from Surajbari area in the region. Apart from monsoon rains in the region, other chemical and biological parameters pertaining to the water in the region also play an important role in the growth of these species from the stage of [[larva]]e to flourishing fishery around this region. The fishing in the region dates back to the early 16th century, During this period Muslim fishermen used to engage in fishing only for sustenance. The casting and retrieval of fishing nets were carried out manually by hand and the entire fishing operation was carried out barefoot. This way of fishing was known as \"Pagadia fishing\" which is in practice even today in the region.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gyanaranjan Dash, Swatipriyanka Sen,M Koya, KR Sreenath|first=Suresh Kumar Mojjada, and HM Bhint|date=2012|title=Ginger Prawn Fishery in Gulf of Kutch: A Seasonal Livelihood for the Traditional Fishermen|url=https://www.asianagrihistory.org/pdf/research/ginger-prawn-16-4.pdf|journal=Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute|volume=Asian Agri-History Vol. 16, No. 4|pages=1\u20139|via=}}</ref>\n\n===Damming Rann of Kutch===\n[[Government of Gujarat|Gujarat government]] is studying to dam the 1.26&nbsp;km stretch of Hadakiya Creek of Rann of Kutch area so that impounded monsoon water can be used for recreational and fisheries purposes.<ref>{{cite web|title=Eye on 2019 polls?

Biosphere reserves aim to promote sustainable development in the surrounding area which is reserved and managed for purposes of [[Conservation (ethic)|conservation]] and to provide special opportunities for study or [[research]]. Such Biosphere reserves are protected under the Wildlife Protection Act, Indian Forest Act and Forest Conservation Act. The Government not only provides funds for the conservation of landscape and biological diversity but also to preserve and promote cultural heritage, education and information exchange around the area. The vegetation around the reserve sanctuary is mainly [[Xerophyte|xerophytic]] as the groundwater lasts for a very short duration. The island covered within the sanctuary has around 253 flowering species.

'''Agariyas''', a community carrying out this Herculean task temporarily settles in this vast land and dig many wells to pump out the salty waters and fill-up the square-shaped fields, the natural climate conditions allow evaporation of the water and leave white crystals of salt. Harvesting seasons begin in the winter season to collect the raw salt from the fields, this process results in a collection of around 15 tons of salt with hard work of 15 days by the workers for a meagre sum of money.

And among many prawn resources, Ginger Prawn plays a significant role in the region as its highly seasonal during monsoon and indigenous of the species. The area which is dry during summers ranging from October\u2013June, However, with the outset of monsoon, the fresh waters from [[Banas River|Banas]], [[Sarasvati River|Saraswati]] and [[Machchhu River|Machchu]] mix with the salty waters of Gulf of Kutch, This brings in an enormous influx of Ginger prawn juveniles into the Rann of Kutch, which is exploited in mass scale. Juveniles of Ginger Prawn which are also known as \u201cSurajbari\" prawns as fish processing units in [[Gujarat]] procure them from Surajbari area in the region. Apart from monsoon rains in the region, other chemical and biological parameters pertaining to the water in the region also play an important role in the growth of these species from the stage of [[larva]]e to flourishing fishery around this region. The fishing in the region dates back to the early 16th century, During this period Muslim fishermen used to engage in fishing only for sustenance. The casting and retrieval of fishing nets were carried out manually by hand and the entire fishing operation was carried out barefoot. This way of fishing was known as \"Pagadia fishing\" which is in practice even today in the region.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gyanaranjan Dash, Swatipriyanka Sen,M Koya, KR Sreenath|first=Suresh Kumar Mojjada, and HM Bhint|date=2012|title=Ginger Prawn Fishery in Gulf of Kutch: A Seasonal Livelihood for the Traditional Fishermen|url=https://www.asianagrihistory.org/pdf/research/ginger-prawn-16-4.pdf|journal=Central Marine Fisheries Research Institute|volume=Asian Agri-History Vol. 16, No. 4|pages=1\u20139|via=}}</ref>\n\n===Damming Rann of Kutch===\n[[Government of Gujarat|Gujarat government]] is studying to dam the 1.26&nbsp;km stretch of Hadakiya Creek of Rann of Kutch area so that impounded monsoon water can be used for recreational and fisheries purposes.<ref>{{cite web|title=Eye on 2019 polls?

Less than 150 of those first indentured German farmers made it to Louisiana and settled along what became known as the German Coast. With tenacity, determination and the leadership of D'arensburg these Germans felled trees, cleared land, and cultivated the soil with simple hand tools as draft animals were not available. The German coast settlers supplied the budding City of New Orleans with corn, rice, eggs. and meat for many years following.\n\nThe [[Mississippi Company]] settled thousands of German pioneers in [[France|French]] [[Louisiana]] during 1721. It encouraged Germans, particularly Germans of the [[Alsace|Alsatian]] region who had recently fallen under French rule, and the [[Swiss people|Swiss]] to immigrate.

As in [[Milwaukee]], Germans in Houston built the brewing industry. By the 1920s, the first generation of college-educated German Americans were moving into the chemical and oil industries.<ref name=\"Conzen\"/>\n\nTexas had about 20,000 German Americans in the 1850s. They did not form a uniform bloc, but were highly diverse and drew from geographic areas and all sectors of European society, except that very few aristocrats or upper middle class businessmen arrived. In this regard, Texas Germania was a microcosm of the Germania nationwide.\n\n<blockquote>The Germans who settled Texas were diverse in many ways. They included peasant farmers and intellectuals; Protestants, Catholics, Jews, and atheists; Prussians, Saxons, and Hessians; abolitionists and slave owners; farmers and townsfolk; frugal, honest folk and ax murderers. They differed in dialect, customs, and physical features. A majority had been farmers in Germany, and most arrived seeking economic opportunities. A few dissident intellectuals fleeing the 1848 revolutions sought political freedom, but few, save perhaps the Wends, went for religious freedom. The German settlements in Texas reflected their diversity. Even in the confined area of the Hill Country, each valley offered a different kind of German. The Llano valley had stern, teetotaling German Methodists, who renounced dancing and fraternal organizations; the Pedernales valley had fun-loving, hardworking Lutherans and Catholics who enjoyed drinking and dancing; and the Guadalupe valley had freethinking Germans descended from intellectual political refugees. The scattered German ethnic islands were also diverse. These small enclaves included Lindsay in Cooke County, largely Westphalian Catholic; Waka in Ochiltree County, Midwestern Mennonite; Hurnville in Clay County, Russian German Baptist; and Lockett in Wilbarger County, Wendish Lutheran.<ref>{{Citation|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/png02 |title=GERMANS |work=Handbook of Texas Online|date=2010-06-15 }}</ref></blockquote>\n\n====Germans from Russia====\n{{see also|Volga Germans|Russian Mennonite}}\n[[File:Volga-Germans-US.jpg|thumb|left|Temporary quarters for [[Volga Germans]] in central Kansas, 1875]]\n\n[[Germans from Russia]] were the most traditional of German-speaking arrivals.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} They were Germans who had lived for generations throughout the [[Russian Empire]], but especially along the [[Volga River]] in Russia and near the [[Crimea]]. Their ancestors had come from all over the German-speaking world, invited by [[Catherine the Great]] in 1762 and 1763 to settle and introduce more advanced German agriculture methods to rural Russia. They had been promised by the manifesto of their settlement the ability to practice their respective Christian denominations, retain their culture and language, and retain immunity from conscription for them and their descendants. As time passed, the Russian monarchy gradually eroded the ethnic German population's relative autonomy. Conscription eventually was reinstated; this was especially harmful to the Mennonites, who practice pacifism. Throughout the 19th century, pressure increased from the Russian government to culturally assimilate. Many Germans from Russia found it necessary to emigrate to avoid conscription and preserve their culture. About 100,000 immigrated by 1900, settling primarily in the Dakotas, Kansas and Nebraska. The southern central part of North Dakota was known as \"the German-Russian triangle\". A smaller number moved farther west, finding employment as ranchers and cowboys.\n\nNegatively influenced by the violation of their rights and cultural persecution by the [[Tsar]], the Germans from Russia who settled in the northern [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] saw themselves a downtrodden ethnic group separate from Russian Americans and having an entirely different experience from the German Americans who had emigrated from German lands; they settled in tight-knit communities who retained their German language and culture. They raised large families, built German-style churches, buried their dead in distinctive cemeteries using cast iron grave markers, and sang German hymns. Many farmers specialized in sugar beets\u2014still a major crop in the upper Great Plains. During World War{{nbsp}}I, their identity was challenged by [[anti-German sentiment]]. By the end of World War{{nbsp}}II, the German language, which had always been used with English for public and official matters, was in serious decline. Today, German is preserved mainly through singing groups and recipes, with the Germans from Russia in the northern Great Plains states speaking predominantly English. German remains the second most spoken language in North and South Dakota, and Germans from Russia often use [[loanword]]s, such as ''Kuchen'' for cake. Despite the loss of their language, the ethnic group remains distinct, and has left a lasting impression on the American West.<ref>Elwyn B.

While they needed profits to stay in operation, they used profits as a tool \"to maintain continuity of the family\".<ref>Sonya Salamon, ''Prairie Patrimony: Family, Farming, and Community in the Midwest'' (U. of North Carolina Press, 1992) pp. 53, 101</ref> They used risk averse strategies, and carefully planned their inheritances to keep the land in the family. Their communities showed smaller average farm size, greater equality, less absentee ownership and greater geographic persistence. As one farmer explained, \"To protect your family has turned out to be the same thing as protecting your land.\"<ref>Salamon, ''Prairie Patrimony'' p 101</ref>\n\nGermany was a large country with many diverse subregions which contributed immigrants. Dubuque was the base of the ''Ostfriesische Nachrichten'' (\"East Fresian News\") from 1881 to 1971. It connected the 20,000 immigrants from East Friesland (Ostfriesland), Germany, to each other across the Midwest, and to their old homeland. In Germany East Friesland was often a topic of ridicule regarding backward rustics, but editor Leupke H\u00fcndling shrewdly combined stories of proud memories of Ostfriesland. The editor enlisted a network of local correspondents. By mixing local American and local German news, letters, poetry, fiction, and dialogue, the German-language newspaper allowed immigrants to honor their origins and celebrate their new life as highly prosperous farmers with much larger farms than were possible back in impoverished Ostfriesland. During the world wars, when Germania came under heavy attack, the paper stressed its humanitarian role, mobilizing readers to help the people of East Friesland with relief funds. Younger generations could usually speak German but not read it, so the subscription based dwindled away as the target audience Americanized itself.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 27501458|title = Heimat in the Heartland: The Significance of an Ethnic Newspaper|journal = Journal of American Ethnic History|volume = 23|issue = 3|pages = 78\u201398|last1 = Lindaman|first1 = Matthew|year = 2004}}</ref>\n\n====Politics====\nRelatively few German Americans held office, but the men voted once they became citizens. In general during the [[Third party System]] (1850s\u20131890s), the Protestants and Jews leaned toward the [[History of the Republican Party (United States)|Republican party]] and the Catholics were strongly [[History of the Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]]. When [[prohibition]] was on the ballot, the Germans voted solidly against it. They strongly distrusted moralistic crusaders, whom they called \"Puritans\", including the temperance reformers and many [[Populist Party (United States)|Populists]]. The German community strongly opposed [[Free Silver]], and voted heavily against crusader [[William Jennings Bryan]] in 1896. In 1900, many German Democrats returned to their party and voted for Bryan, perhaps because of President [[William McKinley]]'s foreign policy.<ref name=\"Jensen1971\">{{cite book|author=Richard J.

The German Americans had voted 80 percent for Lincoln in 1860, and strongly supported the war effort. They were a bastion of the Republican Party in St. Louis and nearby immigrant strongholds in Missouri and southern Illinois. The German Americans were angered by a proposed Missouri state constitution that discriminated against Catholics and freethinkers. The requirement of a special loyalty oath for priests and ministers was troublesome. Despite their strong opposition the constitution was ratified in 1865. Racial tensions with the blacks began to emerge, especially in terms of competition for unskilled labor jobs. Germania was nervous about black suffrage in 1868, fearing that blacks would support puritanical laws, especially regarding the prohibition of beer gardens on Sundays. The tensions split off a large German element in 1872, led by Carl Schurz. They supported the Liberal Republican party led by [[Benjamin Gratz Brown]] for governor in 1870 and [[Horace Greeley]] for president in 1872.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 27501880|title = German Americans, African Americans, and the Republican Party in St. Louis, 1865-1872|journal = Journal of American Ethnic History|volume = 28|issue = 1|pages = 34\u201351|last1 = Anderson|first1 = Kristen L.|year = 2008}}</ref>\n\nMany Germans in late 19th century cities were communists; Germans played a significant role in the labor union movement.<ref>{{cite book|author=Dorothee Schneider|title=Trade Unions and Community: The German Working Class in New York City, 1870-1900|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ATL_3v4_PkwC&pg=PA36|year=1994|page=36|isbn=9780252020575}}</ref><ref>Hartmut Keil, and John B.

German Americans in many cities, such as [[Milwaukee]], brought their strong support of education, establishing German-language schools and teacher training seminaries (''T\u00f6chter-Institut'') to prepare students and teachers in German language training. By the late 19th century, the Germania Publishing Company was established in Milwaukee, a publisher of books, magazines, and newspapers in German.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uwm.edu/~margo/sympapers/Ortlepp.htm|title=Deutsch-Athen Revisited{{nbsp}}...|website=Uwm.edu|accessdate=28 August 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207173929/http://www.uwm.edu/~margo/sympapers/Ortlepp.htm|archivedate=7 December 2008}}</ref>\n\n\"Germania\" was the common term for German American neighborhoods and their organizations.<ref>Noel Iverson, ''Germania, U.S.A.'' (1966).</ref> ''Deutschtum'' was the term for transplanted German nationalism, both culturally and politically. Between 1875 and 1915, the German American population in the United States doubled, and many of its members insisted on maintaining their culture. German was used in local schools and churches, while numerous ''Vereine'', associations dedicated to literature, humor, gymnastics, and singing, sprang up in German American communities. German Americans tended to support the German government's actions, and, even after the United States entered World War{{nbsp}}I, they often voted for antidraft and antiwar candidates. 'Deutschtum' in the United States disintegrated after 1918.<ref>Andrew Yox, \"The German-American Community as a Nationality, 1880-1940\", ''Yearbook of German-American Studies'' 2001 36: 181-193; Kazal (2004)</ref>\n\n===Music===\nBeginning in 1741, the German-speaking [[Moravian Church]] Settlements of [[Bethlehem, Pennsylvania|Bethlehem]], [[Nazareth, Pennsylvania|Nazareth]] and [[Lititz, Pennsylvania|Lititz]], [[Pennsylvania]], and [[Wachovia, North Carolina|Wachovia]] in North Carolina had highly developed musical cultures. Choral music, Brass and String Music and Congregational singing were highly cultivated. The Moravian Church produced many composers and musicians. [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]]'s ''Creation'' had its American debut in Bethlehem in the early 19th century.\n\nThe spiritual beliefs of Johann Conrad Beissel (1690\u20131768) and the Ephrata Cloister\u2014such as the asceticism and mysticism of this Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, group - are reflected in Beissel's treatises on music and hymns, which have been considered the beginning of America's musical heritage.<ref>Lucile E.

Started in 1848, the organization was strengthened by the arrival of German liberals after the failure of the revolution of that year. By the mid-1850s the Germans formed one-third of Louisville's population and faced nativist hostility organized in the Know-Nothing movement. Violent demonstrations forced the chorus to suppress publicity of its performances that included works by composer Richard Wagner. The Liederkranz suspended operations during the Civil War, but afterward grew rapidly, and was able to build a large auditorium by 1873. An audience of 8,000 that attended a performance in 1877 demonstrated that the Germans were an accepted part of Louisville life.<ref>Erna Ottl Gwinn, \"The Liederkranz in Louisville, 1848\u20131877\", ''Filson Club History Quarterly'' 1975 49(3): 276\u2013290,</ref>\n\nThe Imperial government in Berlin promoted German culture in the U.S., especially music. A steady influx of German-born conductors, including Arthur Nikisch and Karl Muck, spurred the reception of German music in the United States, while German musicians seized on Victorian Americans' growing concern with 'emotion'. The performance of pieces such as Beethoven's ''Ninth Symphony'' established German serious music as the superior language of feeling.<ref>Jessica C. E.

The National Turnerbund, the head organization of the Turnvereine, started drilling members as in militia units in 1854. Nearly half of all Turners fought in the Civil War, mostly on the Union side, and a special group served as bodyguards for President Lincoln.\n\nBy the 1890s, Turners numbered nearly 65,000. At the turn of the 21st century, with the ethnic identity of European Americans in flux and Americanization a key element of immigrant life, there were few Turner groups, athletic events were limited, and non-Germans were members. A survey of surviving groups and members reflects these radical changes in the role of Turner societies and their marginalization in 21st-century American society, as younger German Americans tended not to belong, even in strongholds of German heritage in the Midwest.<ref>Annette R.

One example is [[Hiwwe wie Driwwe]] (Kutztown, PA), the nation's only [[Pennsylvania German]] newspaper, which was established in 1997.\n\n===Athletics===\nGermans brought organized gymnastics to America, and were strong supporters of sports programs. They used sport both to promote ethnic identity and pride and to facilitate integration into American society. Beginning in the mid-19th century, the [[Turners|Turner]] movement offered exercise and sports programs, while also providing a social haven for the thousands of new German immigrants arriving in the United States each year. Another highly successful German sports organization was the [[Buffalo Germans]] basketball team, winners of 762 games (against only 85 losses) in the early years of the 20th century. These examples, and others, reflect the evolving place of sport in the assimilation and socialization of much of the German-American population.<ref>Annette R. Hofmann, \"Between Ethnic Separation and Assimilation: German Immigrants and Their Athletic Endeavours in Their New American Home Country\", ''International Journal of the History of Sport'' 2008 25(8): 993-1009,</ref>\n\n===Religion===\n[[File:US census map of Lutheran churches - 1850.jpg|thumb|This 1850 census map shows the Lutheran population. Nearly all were German, since few Scandinavians had arrived yet.]]\n\nGerman immigrants who arrived before the 19th century tended to have been members of the Evangelical Lutheran Churches in Germany, and created the Lutheran Synods of Pennsylvania, North Carolina and New York. The largest Lutheran denominations in the U.S. today\u2014the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]], the [[Lutheran Church\u2013Missouri Synod]], and the [[Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod]]\u2014are all descended from churches started by German immigrants among others. [[Calvinist]] Germans founded the [[Reformed Church in the United States]] (especially in New York and Pennsylvania), and the [[Evangelical Synod of North America]] (strongest in the Midwest), which is now part of the [[United Church of Christ]]. Many immigrants joined different churches from those that existed in Germany. Protestants often joined the [[United Methodist Church|Methodist]] church.<ref name=\"Conzen\"/> In the 1740s, [[Nicolaus Ludwig Zinzendorf|Count Nicolas von Zinzendorf]] tried to unite all the German-speaking Christians\u2014(Lutheran, Reformed, and Separatists)\u2014into one \"Church of God in the Spirit\". The [[Moravian Church]] in America is one of the results of this effort, as are the many \"Union\" churches in rural Pennsylvania.\n\nBefore 1800, communities of [[Amish]], [[Mennonite]]s, [[Schwarzenau Brethren]] and [[Moravian Church#Missions|Moravians]] had formed and are still in existence today. The Old Order Amish and a majority of the [[Old Order Mennonite]]s still speak dialects of German, including Pennsylvania German, informally known as [[Pennsylvania Dutch]]. The Amish, who were originally from southern Germany and Switzerland, arrived in Pennsylvania during the early 18th century. Amish immigration to the United States reached its peak between the years 1727 and 1770. Religious freedom was perhaps the most pressing cause for Amish immigration to Pennsylvania, which became known as a haven for persecuted religious groups.<ref name=\"The Amish\">{{Citation|url=http://religiousmovements.lib.virginia.edu/nrms/amish.html|title=The Amish|accessdate=2006-10-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061107190410/http://religiousmovements.lib.virginia.edu/nrms/amish.html|archive-date=2006-11-07|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe Hutterites are another example of a group of German Americans who continue a lifestyle similar to that of their ancestors. Like the Amish, they fled persecution for their religious beliefs, and came to the United States between 1874 and 1879. Today, Hutterites mostly reside in [[Montana]], [[the Dakotas]], and [[Minnesota]], and the western provinces of Canada. Hutterites continue to speak [[Hutterite German]]. Most are able to understand Standard German in addition to their dialect.<ref name=\"National Geographic, the Hutterites\">{{Citation |last=Allard |first=William Albert |year=2006 |title=Hutterite Sojourn |publisher=National Geographic Society |location=Washington, D.C.}}</ref> The German speaking [[Russian Mennonites|\"Russian\" Mennonites]] migrated during the same time as the Hutterites, but assimilated relatively quickly in the United States, whereas groups of \"Russian\" Mennonites in Canada resisted assimilation.<ref>Donald B. Kraybill and Nelson Hostetter: ''Anabaptist World USA'', 2001, Scottdale, PA, and Waterloo, ON, page 115.</ref>\n\nImmigrants from Germany in the mid-to-late-19th century brought many different religions with them. The most numerous were Lutheran or [[Catholic Church in the United States|Catholic]], although the Lutherans were themselves split among different groups. The more conservative Lutherans comprised the Lutheran Church\u2013Missouri Synod and the Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod. Other Lutherans formed various synods, most of which merged with Scandinavian-based synods in 1988, forming the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America.<ref>{{Citation|last=Almen|first=Lowell|title=One Great Cloud of Witnesses|publisher=Augsburg Fortress|location=Minneapolis|year=1997}}</ref> [[Catholic Germans]] started immigrating in large numbers in the mid to latter 19th century, spurred in particular by the ''[[Kulturkampf]]''.\n\nSome 19th-century immigrants, especially the \"Forty-Eighters\", were secular, rejecting formal religion. About 250,000 German Jews had arrived by the 1870s, and they sponsored reform synagogues in many small cities across the country. About two million Central and Eastern European Jews arrived from the 1880s to 1924, bringing more traditional religious practices.<ref>Edward S. Shapiro, \"Jews\", in Elliott Barkan, ed.

As one scholar concludes, \"The overwhelming evidence{{nbsp}}... indicates that the German-American school was a bilingual one much (perhaps a whole generation or more) earlier than 1917, and that the majority of the pupils may have been English-dominant bilinguals from the early 1880s on.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/~haroldfs/540/handouts/gachurch/biggac.html|title=Language loyalty in the German-American Church: the Case of an Over-confident Minority.|website=Ccat.sas.upenn.edu|accessdate=17 March 2015}}</ref> By 1914, the older members attended German-language church services, while younger ones attended English services (in Lutheran, Evangelical and Catholic churches). In German parochial schools, the children spoke English among themselves, though some of their classes were in German. In 1917\u201318, after the US entry into World War{{nbsp}}I on the side of the British, nearly all German language instruction ended, as did most German-language church services.<ref name=\"Hawgood\">{{Citation|last=Hawgood|first=John|title=The Tragedy of German-America|publisher=Arno Press|location=New York|date=1970}}</ref>\n\nAbout 1.5 million Americans speak German at home, according to the 2000 census. From 1860\u20131917, German was widely spoken in German neighborhoods; see [[German in the United States]]. There is a false belief, called the [[Muhlenberg legend]], that German was almost the official language of the U.S. There was never any such proposal. The U.S. has no [[official language]], but use of German was strongly discouraged during World War{{nbsp}}I and fell out of daily use in many places.<ref>see [http://usa.usembassy.de/germanamericans-language.htm U.S. State Department, \"German Language in the U.S\"]</ref>\n\nThere were fierce battles in Wisconsin and Illinois around 1890 regarding proposals to stop the use of German as the primary language in public and parochial schools. The [[Bennett Law]] was a highly controversial state law passed in [[Wisconsin]] in 1889 that required the use of English to teach major subjects in all public and private elementary and high schools. It affected the state's many German-language private schools (and some Norwegian schools), and was bitterly resented by German American communities. The German Catholics and Lutherans each operated large networks of [[parochial school]]s in the state. Because the language used in the classroom was German, the law meant the teachers would have to be replaced with bilingual teachers, and in most cases shut down. The Germans formed a coalition between Catholics and Lutherans, under the leadership of the Democratic Party, and the language issue produced a landslide for the Democrats, as Republicans dropped the issue until World War{{nbsp}}I. By 1917, almost all schools taught in English, but courses in German were common in areas with large German populations. These courses were permanently dropped.<ref>Robert J. Ulrich, ''The Bennett Law of Eighteen Eighty-Nine: Education and Politics in Wisconsin'' (1981).</ref>\n\n==Assimilation==\n\n===Introduction===\n\"Assimilation\" in this context means the steady loss of distinctive characteristics (especially language), as the Germans melted into a common American nationality.\n\n===The apparent disappearance of German American identity===\nGerman Americans are no longer a conspicuous ethnic group.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.economist.com/united-states/2015/02/05/the-silent-minority|title=The silent minority|journal=The Economist|date=5 February 2015}}</ref> As Melvin G. Holli puts it, \"Public expression of German ethnicity is nowhere proportionate to the number of German Americans in the nation's population. Almost nowhere are German Americans as a group as visible as many smaller groups. Two examples suffice to illustrate this point: when one surveys the popular television scene of the past decade, one hears Yiddish humor done by comedians; one sees Polish, Greek, and East European detective heroes; Italian-Americans in situation comedies; and blacks such as the Jeffersons and Huxtables. But one searches in vain for quintessentially German-American characters or melodramas patterned after German-American experiences.{{nbsp}}... A second example of the virtual invisibility is that, though German Americans have been one of the largest ethnic groups in the Chicago area (numbering near one-half million between 1900 and 1910), no museum or archive exists to memorialize that fact. On the other hand, many smaller groups such as Lithuanians, Poles, Swedes, Jews, and others have museums, archives, and exhibit halls dedicated to their immigrant forefathers\".<ref name=\"Holli\">{{cite book|editor-last1=Holli|editor-first1=Melvin G.|editor-last2=Jones|editor-first2=Peter d'A.|title=Ethnic Chicago: A Multicultural Portrait|last=Holli|first=Melvin G.|chapter=German American Ethnic and Cultural Identity from 1890 Onward|chapter-url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=2JbU1d9Xil0C&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|year=1995|publisher=William B.

The German language was being taught in the schools again; the German theater still survived; and German Day celebrations were drawing larger and larger crowds. Although the assimilation process had taken its toll of pre-1914 German immigrants, a smaller group of newer postwar arrivals had developed a vocal if not impolitic interest in the rebuilding process in Germany under [[National Socialism]]. As the 1930s moved on, Hitler's brutality and Nazi excesses made Germanism once again suspect. The rise of Nazism, as Luebke notes, 'transformed German ethnicity in America into a source of social and psychological discomfort, if not distress.

As Professor Tischauser wrote, \"The notoriety gained by those who supported the German government between 1933 and 1941 cast a pall over German-Americans everywhere.

Holli, by the end of World War{{nbsp}}II, German Americans \"were ethnics without any visible national or local leaders. Not even politicians would think of addressing them explicitly as an ethnic constituency as they would say, Polish Americans, Jewish Americans, or African Americans.\"<ref name=\"Holli\" />{{rp|109}} Holli states that \"Being on the wrong side in two wars had a devastating and long-term negative impact on the public celebration of German-American ethnicity\".<ref name=\"Holli\" />{{rp|106}}\n\nHistorians have tried to explain what became of the German Americans and their descendants. Kazal (2004) looks at Germans in Philadelphia, focusing on four ethnic subcultures: middle-class Vereinsdeutsche, working-class socialists, Lutherans, and Catholics. Each group followed a somewhat distinctive path toward assimilation. Lutherans, and the better situated Vereinsdeutsche with whom they often overlapped, after World War{{nbsp}}I abandoned the last major German characteristics and redefined themselves as old stock or as \"Nordic\" Americans, stressing their colonial roots in Pennsylvania and distancing themselves from more recent immigrants. On the other hand, working-class and Catholic Germans, groups that heavily overlapped, lived and worked with [[Irish Americans|Irish]] and other European ethnics; they also gave up German characteristics but came to identify themselves as white ethnics, distancing themselves above all from [[African American]] recent arrivals in nearby neighborhoods. Well before World War{{nbsp}}I, women in particular were becoming more and more involved in a mass consumer culture that lured them out of their German-language neighborhood shops and into English language downtown department stores. The 1920s and 1930s brought English language popular culture via movies and radio that drowned out the few surviving German language venues.<ref name=\"Kazal\">Russell A. Kazal, ''Becoming Old Stock: The Paradox of German-American Identity'' (2004).</ref>\n\n===Factors making German Americans susceptible to assimilation===\nKazal points out that German Americans have not had an experience that is especially typical of immigrant groups. \"Certainly, in a number of ways, the German-American experience was idiosyncratic. No other large immigrant group was subjected to such strong, sustained pressure to abandon its ethnic identity for an American one. None was so divided internally, a characteristic that made German Americans especially vulnerable to such pressure. Among the larger groups that immigrated in the country after 1830, none - despite regional variations - appears to have muted its ethnic identity to so great an extent.\"<ref name=\"Kazal\" />{{rp|273}} This quote from Kazal identifies both external pressures on German Americans and internal dividedness among them as reasons for their high level of assimilation.\n\nRegarding the external pressures, Kazal writes: \"The pressure imposed on German Americans to forsake their ethnic identity was extreme in both nature and duration. No other ethnic group saw its 'adoptive fatherland' twice enter a world war against its country of origin. To this stigma, the Third Reich added the lasting one of [[the Holocaust]]. In her study of ethnic identity in the 1980s, sociologist Mary Waters noted that the 'effect of the Nazi movement and World War{{nbsp}}II was still quite strong' in shaping 'popular perceptions of the German-American character', enough so that some individuals of mixed background often would acknowledge only the non-German part of their ancestry.\"<ref name=\"Kazal\" />{{rp|273}}{{efn|In the book that Kazal appears to be quoting here, Waters states \"Many people cited various political or social events as having an effect on their consciousness and degree of ethnic identity. I have already noted Laurie Jablonski's stronger identification with her Polish than with her German ancestry, a fact she attributed to the influence her surname had on how others reacted to her. When I asked about times when the relative influence of one or the other side might be stronger, she revealed that political events in Germany and Poland had a lot to do with how she chose to identify herself\".<ref name=\"Waters\">{{cite book|title=Ethnic Options: Choosing Identities in America|last=Waters|first=Mary C.|url=https://archive.org/details/ethnicoptionscho0000wate|url-access=registration|year=1990|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520070837}}</ref>{{rp|83}} Waters goes on to state that \"The association of being German with being a Nazi is still strong for Laurie, forty years after World War{{nbsp}}II. A similar story to Laurie's is related in a description by Hinda Winawer-Steiner and Norbert Wetzel of a workshop for family therapists on ethnicity and family therapy. The therapists were supposed to talk about their ethnicity and how it might influence their work. A discussion of a German-American family revealed that two of the therapists who had identified themselves as Polish-American at the beginning of the workshop were, in fact, half German. It turned out that they were suppressing their German identity because of the negative connotations associated with being German. \"When asked, one explained that she simply considered herself Polish. The other, after some reflection, said that in a group that was half Jewish, she had been reluctant to acknowledge her German heritage\" (Winawer-Steiner and Wetzel 1982, 253)\".<ref name=\"Waters\" />{{rp|84}}}} Kazal contrasts this experience with the experiences of the Japanese, Poles, Czechs, Lithuanians, Italians, east European Jews, and Irish. \"Japanese Americans, of course, suffered far more during the Second World War\",<ref name=\"Kazal\" />{{rp|273}} but until at least the 1950s, the pressure on Japanese Americans \"ran toward exclusion from, rather than inclusion in, the nation\".<ref name=\"Kazal\" />{{rp|273}} \"The state and many ordinary European Americans refused to recognize Asians as potentially American. In contrast, they pressured Germans to accept precisely that American identity in place of a German one\".<ref name=\"Kazal\" />{{rp|273}} Kazal goes on to state \"The burden of \"enemy\" status made those pressures far greater for Germans than for other European ethnic groups. To some extent, American intervention in World War{{nbsp}}I actually helped fuel ethnic nationalism in the United States among Poles, Czechs, Lithuanians, Italians, and east European Jews, who felt their desires for existing or prospective homelands stood to gain from an Allied victory. Indeed, some historians have depicted the following decade as one when immigrants transcended local or regional homeland affiliations to craft or further consolidate national identities as Poles, Czechs, and Italians. Such groups escaped the fury of \"100 percent Americanism\" during the war, in part because of their obvious stake in the defeat of the Central Powers\".<ref name=\"Kazal\" />{{rp|273 - 274}} As for Irish Americans, Kazal states that the lack of enthusiasm of many of them for helping England made them \"vulnerable to the wartime \"antihyphen\" climate\",<ref name=\"Kazal\" />{{rp|274}}, but that \"Irish nationalist activity intensified during and immediately after that war, as many Irish Americans became swept up in the events leading to the creation of the Irish Free State\",<ref name=\"Kazal\" />{{rp|274}} and that \"It made a difference for the long-term viability of Irish-American identity that the Irish homeland not only did not go to war with the United States but, in fact, emerged during the interwar years as a sovereign nation\".<ref name=\"Kazal\" />{{rp|274}}\n\nKazal then goes on to discuss the internal dividedness. He writes: \"German-American identity fell victim not only to a peculiar set of events, but also to an extraordinarily high level of internal diversity. All ethnic groups have internal divides, whether of class, religion, gender, politics, or homeland region. What distinguished German America was that it incorporated not just some but ''all'' of these divisions. Irish Americans, for example, had lost their status as primarily a proletarian group by 1900, yet they were united by religion and politics. \"Irish American\" had come to mean Irish Catholic; the vast majority of Irish Americans subscribed to some form of Irish nationalism conflated with American patriotism; and Irish-American voters were overwhelmingly Democrats. The power of this synthesis, Kerby Miller argued, explains the survival of Irish-American identity despite the ebbing of organised Irish-American nationalism after the Free State's founding. For German Americans, religion and party politics were sources of division rather than of unity\".<ref name=\"Kazal\" />{{rp|274}} Kazal goes on to state that \"The subcultures of German America, meanwhile, had ample opportunity for contact, however testy, with non-German counterparts. The latter beckoned as destinations when the cost of being German-American rose too high\".<ref name=\"Kazal\" />{{rp|274}} It is not just Kazal who has pointed out the internal dividedness of the German American community. Kathleen Neils Conzen has pointed it out; David Peterson states that Conzen, \"along with many others, concludes that German-Americans' heterogeneity, particularly in religion, hampered their ability to build socially and politically stable ethnic communities\",<ref name=\"Peterson\">{{cite journal|journal=Journal of American Ethnic History|volume=11|issue=2|pages=27\u201355|jstor = 27500930|last1 = Peterson|first1 = David|title=\"From Bone Depth\": German-American Communities in Rural Minnesota before the Great War|year=1992}}</ref>{{rp|27}} and that Conzen \"stresses that German Americans assimilated relatively rapidly and that their diversity played a key role in that assimilation\".<ref name=\"Peterson\" />{{rp|47}}{{efn|Peterson himself seems not to fully agree with this, stating \"Most community studies have examined very large, heterogeneous German-American urban populations that assimilated relatively quickly or, less commonly, large, homogeneous rural ones that did not. Hence, German-Americans' diversity has emerged as perhaps the crucial variable accounting for their assimilationist propensities. Otter Tail County, certainly a rural area, had German-American communities that were diverse and small, and these communities succeeded in maintaining crucial ethnic boundaries into the twentieth century. The persistence of these heterogeneous, lightly populated German-American communities suggest that place of residence was the key factor in the rate of German-American assimilation. Urban orientation may have corroded German-American ethnic boundaries more than diversity did, though the two variables were not unrelated\".<ref name=\"Peterson\" />{{rp|47 - 48}}}} (Conzen is also drawn upon by Joy Kristina Adams, who cites Conzen when she (Adams) states that \"The diversity and size of the German settlements made them susceptible to long-term Americanization by fostering factionalism, increasing contacts between Germans and non-Germans, and weakening unified leadership\".)<ref>[https://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/bitstream/handle/2152/2652/adamsj55244.pdf Going ''Deutsch'': Heritage Tourism and Identity in German Texas], p. 45</ref> The ''Encyclopedia of the Great Plains'' also stresses the internal dividedness, stating \"One of the distinguishing characteristics of the German population in North America (especially in comparison to other immigrant groups) has been its relative degree of cultural diversity, reflected especially in the number of Christian denominations to which Germans belonged. In part this reflects patterns that had developed over centuries in Germany, whose population came to include nearly every variety of Christianity\u2013from Catholics, Lutherans, and Reformed groups to more radical Anabaptist pietistic movements such as Amish, Mennonites, Schwenkfelders, and the Moravian church. It is not surprising, then, that nearly all of these denominations were represented among the German immigrant population in North America.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://plainshumanities.unl.edu/encyclopedia/doc/egp.ea.013|title=Encyclopedia of the Great Plains - GERMANS|website=plainshumanities.unl.edu}}</ref> Robert Paul McCaffery points out that \"Despite their numbers{{nbsp}}... and unlike many immigrant groups, Germans never united as a powerful ethnic block.

St. Louis served (and still does) as the seat of the Lutheran Church Missouri Synod, a conservative American Lutheran confession, and their local strength led to friction with Germans of other faiths. These Lutherans did not traffic much with the sizable German Catholic population of the city, who often shared their houses of worship and political stances with the Irish. The small rabbinical German Jewish community remained insular. The Freethinkers, atheists, socialists, et al., had little use for any of these groups. In addition, the Germans, while heavily concentrated in a few pockets of north and south St. Louis, were spread across the city proper and into the larger countryside\".<ref name=\"Baker\" />{{rp|99}} And according to the [[Max Kade]] Institute for German-American Studies, \"The diversity of religious expression among German-speaking immigrants was paralleled by a high degree of heterogeneity stemming from differences in regional and linguistic origins. This situation differed from that of other nineteenth-century immigrant groups, notably the Irish, but also Italians and people of other European backgrounds. The resulting lack of a unified and clearly definable German-American community explains in part why only few Americans, including those of German descent, have any idea when Steuben Day or German-American Day falls, whereas the Irish St. Patrick's Day is one of America's most popular celebrations, and Columbus Day, named after the Italian explorer, is a federal holiday\".<ref name=\"Max Kade Institute\">{{cite web|url=https://mki.wisc.edu/content/how-german-american-building-communities|title=How German Is American?

They were widely dispersed throughout the Second and Third Municipalities, and in Carrollton and Lafayette, and they were fragmented by differences in religion, region of origin, and class. The proliferation of German clubs, associations, and institutions bespoke the Germans' numerical significance in the city, but it also attested to their divisions, for such organizations tended to cater to very specific groups rather than bind the various German strands together. To be sure, distinct concentrations of Germans existed in various parts of the city, wherein various German cultural values survived and influenced the culture of non-Germans in their midst, and German ''Gem\u00fctlichkeit'' was easily accommodated in the city's genial public culture. But, overall, Germans were too diverse and divided to dominate the city\".<ref name=\"Miller\" />{{rp|129}} Miller contrasts this situation with the situation of Irish Americans in New Orleans: \"Irish immigrants had greater cohesion and wider influence than the Germans. In the great waves of late antebellum immigration, the vast majority of Irish immigrants entering New Orleans came from a few select counties in Ireland.

[[Anne, Queen of Great Britain]], helped them get to her colonies in America. The trip was long and difficult to survive because of the poor quality of food and water aboard ships and the infectious disease [[typhus]].

Most were first settled along the [[Hudson River]] in work camps, to pay off their passage. By 1711, seven villages had been established in New York on the [[Robert Livingston the Elder|Robert Livingston]] manor. In 1723 Germans became the first Europeans allowed to buy land in the [[Mohawk Valley]] west of [[Little Falls (town), New York|Little Falls]]. One hundred homesteads were allocated in the Burnetsfield Patent. By 1750, the Germans occupied a strip some {{convert|12|mi|km}} long along both sides of the [[Mohawk River]]. The soil was excellent; some 500 houses were built, mostly of stone, and the region prospered in spite of Indian raids. [[Herkimer (town), New York|Herkimer]] was the best-known of the German settlements in a region long known as the \"German Flats\".<ref name=\"Knittle\"/>\n\nThey kept to themselves, married their own, spoke German, attended Lutheran churches, and retained their own customs and foods.

Of the over 5,000 Germans initially immigrating primarily from the Alsace Region as few as 500 made up the first wave of immigrants to leave France en route to the Americas. Less than 150 of those first indentured German farmers made it to Louisiana and settled along what became known as the German Coast. With tenacity, determination and the leadership of D'arensburg these Germans felled trees, cleared land, and cultivated the soil with simple hand tools as draft animals were not available. The German coast settlers supplied the budding City of New Orleans with corn, rice, eggs. and meat for many years following.\n\nThe [[Mississippi Company]] settled thousands of German pioneers in [[France|French]] [[Louisiana]] during 1721. It encouraged Germans, particularly Germans of the [[Alsace|Alsatian]] region who had recently fallen under French rule, and the [[Swiss people|Swiss]] to immigrate. [[Alsace]] was sold to France within the greater context of the [[Thirty Years' War]] (1618\u20131648).\n\nThe [[Jesuit]] [[Pierre Fran\u00e7ois Xavier de Charlevoix|Charlevoix]] traveled [[New France]] ([[Canada]] and Louisiana) in the early 1700s.

As in [[Milwaukee]], Germans in Houston built the brewing industry. By the 1920s, the first generation of college-educated German Americans were moving into the chemical and oil industries.<ref name=\"Conzen\"/>\n\nTexas had about 20,000 German Americans in the 1850s. They did not form a uniform bloc, but were highly diverse and drew from geographic areas and all sectors of European society, except that very few aristocrats or upper middle class businessmen arrived. In this regard, Texas Germania was a microcosm of the Germania nationwide.\n\n<blockquote>The Germans who settled Texas were diverse in many ways. They included peasant farmers and intellectuals; Protestants, Catholics, Jews, and atheists; Prussians, Saxons, and Hessians; abolitionists and slave owners; farmers and townsfolk; frugal, honest folk and ax murderers. They differed in dialect, customs, and physical features. A majority had been farmers in Germany, and most arrived seeking economic opportunities. A few dissident intellectuals fleeing the 1848 revolutions sought political freedom, but few, save perhaps the Wends, went for religious freedom. The German settlements in Texas reflected their diversity. Even in the confined area of the Hill Country, each valley offered a different kind of German. The Llano valley had stern, teetotaling German Methodists, who renounced dancing and fraternal organizations; the Pedernales valley had fun-loving, hardworking Lutherans and Catholics who enjoyed drinking and dancing; and the Guadalupe valley had freethinking Germans descended from intellectual political refugees. The scattered German ethnic islands were also diverse. These small enclaves included Lindsay in Cooke County, largely Westphalian Catholic; Waka in Ochiltree County, Midwestern Mennonite; Hurnville in Clay County, Russian German Baptist; and Lockett in Wilbarger County, Wendish Lutheran.<ref>{{Citation|url=http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/png02 |title=GERMANS |work=Handbook of Texas Online|date=2010-06-15 }}</ref></blockquote>\n\n====Germans from Russia====\n{{see also|Volga Germans|Russian Mennonite}}\n[[File:Volga-Germans-US.jpg|thumb|left|Temporary quarters for [[Volga Germans]] in central Kansas, 1875]]\n\n[[Germans from Russia]] were the most traditional of German-speaking arrivals.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}} They were Germans who had lived for generations throughout the [[Russian Empire]], but especially along the [[Volga River]] in Russia and near the [[Crimea]]. Their ancestors had come from all over the German-speaking world, invited by [[Catherine the Great]] in 1762 and 1763 to settle and introduce more advanced German agriculture methods to rural Russia. They had been promised by the manifesto of their settlement the ability to practice their respective Christian denominations, retain their culture and language, and retain immunity from conscription for them and their descendants. As time passed, the Russian monarchy gradually eroded the ethnic German population's relative autonomy. Conscription eventually was reinstated; this was especially harmful to the Mennonites, who practice pacifism. Throughout the 19th century, pressure increased from the Russian government to culturally assimilate. Many Germans from Russia found it necessary to emigrate to avoid conscription and preserve their culture. About 100,000 immigrated by 1900, settling primarily in the Dakotas, Kansas and Nebraska. The southern central part of North Dakota was known as \"the German-Russian triangle\". A smaller number moved farther west, finding employment as ranchers and cowboys.\n\nNegatively influenced by the violation of their rights and cultural persecution by the [[Tsar]], the Germans from Russia who settled in the northern [[Midwestern United States|Midwest]] saw themselves a downtrodden ethnic group separate from Russian Americans and having an entirely different experience from the German Americans who had emigrated from German lands; they settled in tight-knit communities who retained their German language and culture. They raised large families, built German-style churches, buried their dead in distinctive cemeteries using cast iron grave markers, and sang German hymns. Many farmers specialized in sugar beets\u2014still a major crop in the upper Great Plains. During World War{{nbsp}}I, their identity was challenged by [[anti-German sentiment]]. By the end of World War{{nbsp}}II, the German language, which had always been used with English for public and official matters, was in serious decline. Today, German is preserved mainly through singing groups and recipes, with the Germans from Russia in the northern Great Plains states speaking predominantly English. German remains the second most spoken language in North and South Dakota, and Germans from Russia often use [[loanword]]s, such as ''Kuchen'' for cake. Despite the loss of their language, the ethnic group remains distinct, and has left a lasting impression on the American West.<ref>Elwyn B.

For example, the Santa Fe railroad hired its own commissioner for immigration, and sold over {{convert|300,000|acre|km2}} to German-speaking farmers.<ref>C. B.

While they needed profits to stay in operation, they used profits as a tool \"to maintain continuity of the family\".<ref>Sonya Salamon, ''Prairie Patrimony: Family, Farming, and Community in the Midwest'' (U. of North Carolina Press, 1992) pp. 53, 101</ref> They used risk averse strategies, and carefully planned their inheritances to keep the land in the family. Their communities showed smaller average farm size, greater equality, less absentee ownership and greater geographic persistence. As one farmer explained, \"To protect your family has turned out to be the same thing as protecting your land.\"<ref>Salamon, ''Prairie Patrimony'' p 101</ref>\n\nGermany was a large country with many diverse subregions which contributed immigrants. Dubuque was the base of the ''Ostfriesische Nachrichten'' (\"East Fresian News\") from 1881 to 1971. It connected the 20,000 immigrants from East Friesland (Ostfriesland), Germany, to each other across the Midwest, and to their old homeland. In Germany East Friesland was often a topic of ridicule regarding backward rustics, but editor Leupke H\u00fcndling shrewdly combined stories of proud memories of Ostfriesland. The editor enlisted a network of local correspondents. By mixing local American and local German news, letters, poetry, fiction, and dialogue, the German-language newspaper allowed immigrants to honor their origins and celebrate their new life as highly prosperous farmers with much larger farms than were possible back in impoverished Ostfriesland. During the world wars, when Germania came under heavy attack, the paper stressed its humanitarian role, mobilizing readers to help the people of East Friesland with relief funds. Younger generations could usually speak German but not read it, so the subscription based dwindled away as the target audience Americanized itself.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 27501458|title = Heimat in the Heartland: The Significance of an Ethnic Newspaper|journal = Journal of American Ethnic History|volume = 23|issue = 3|pages = 78\u201398|last1 = Lindaman|first1 = Matthew|year = 2004}}</ref>\n\n====Politics====\nRelatively few German Americans held office, but the men voted once they became citizens. In general during the [[Third party System]] (1850s\u20131890s), the Protestants and Jews leaned toward the [[History of the Republican Party (United States)|Republican party]] and the Catholics were strongly [[History of the Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]]. When [[prohibition]] was on the ballot, the Germans voted solidly against it. They strongly distrusted moralistic crusaders, whom they called \"Puritans\", including the temperance reformers and many [[Populist Party (United States)|Populists]]. The German community strongly opposed [[Free Silver]], and voted heavily against crusader [[William Jennings Bryan]] in 1896. In 1900, many German Democrats returned to their party and voted for Bryan, perhaps because of President [[William McKinley]]'s foreign policy.<ref name=\"Jensen1971\">{{cite book|author=Richard J.

The German Americans had voted 80 percent for Lincoln in 1860, and strongly supported the war effort. They were a bastion of the Republican Party in St. Louis and nearby immigrant strongholds in Missouri and southern Illinois. The German Americans were angered by a proposed Missouri state constitution that discriminated against Catholics and freethinkers. The requirement of a special loyalty oath for priests and ministers was troublesome. Despite their strong opposition the constitution was ratified in 1865. Racial tensions with the blacks began to emerge, especially in terms of competition for unskilled labor jobs. Germania was nervous about black suffrage in 1868, fearing that blacks would support puritanical laws, especially regarding the prohibition of beer gardens on Sundays. The tensions split off a large German element in 1872, led by Carl Schurz. They supported the Liberal Republican party led by [[Benjamin Gratz Brown]] for governor in 1870 and [[Horace Greeley]] for president in 1872.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor = 27501880|title = German Americans, African Americans, and the Republican Party in St. Louis, 1865-1872|journal = Journal of American Ethnic History|volume = 28|issue = 1|pages = 34\u201351|last1 = Anderson|first1 = Kristen L.|year = 2008}}</ref>\n\nMany Germans in late 19th century cities were communists; Germans played a significant role in the labor union movement.<ref>{{cite book|author=Dorothee Schneider|title=Trade Unions and Community: The German Working Class in New York City, 1870-1900|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ATL_3v4_PkwC&pg=PA36|year=1994|page=36|isbn=9780252020575}}</ref><ref>Hartmut Keil, and John B.

German Americans in many cities, such as [[Milwaukee]], brought their strong support of education, establishing German-language schools and teacher training seminaries (''T\u00f6chter-Institut'') to prepare students and teachers in German language training. By the late 19th century, the Germania Publishing Company was established in Milwaukee, a publisher of books, magazines, and newspapers in German.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.uwm.edu/~margo/sympapers/Ortlepp.htm|title=Deutsch-Athen Revisited{{nbsp}}...|website=Uwm.edu|accessdate=28 August 2017|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207173929/http://www.uwm.edu/~margo/sympapers/Ortlepp.htm|archivedate=7 December 2008}}</ref>\n\n\"Germania\" was the common term for German American neighborhoods and their organizations.<ref>Noel Iverson, ''Germania, U.S.A.'' (1966).</ref> ''Deutschtum'' was the term for transplanted German nationalism, both culturally and politically. Between 1875 and 1915, the German American population in the United States doubled, and many of its members insisted on maintaining their culture. German was used in local schools and churches, while numerous ''Vereine'', associations dedicated to literature, humor, gymnastics, and singing, sprang up in German American communities. German Americans tended to support the German government's actions, and, even after the United States entered World War{{nbsp}}I, they often voted for antidraft and antiwar candidates. 'Deutschtum' in the United States disintegrated after 1918.<ref>Andrew Yox, \"The German-American Community as a Nationality, 1880-1940\", ''Yearbook of German-American Studies'' 2001 36: 181-193; Kazal (2004)</ref>\n\n===Music===\nBeginning in 1741, the German-speaking [[Moravian Church]] Settlements of [[Bethlehem, Pennsylvania|Bethlehem]], [[Nazareth, Pennsylvania|Nazareth]] and [[Lititz, Pennsylvania|Lititz]], [[Pennsylvania]], and [[Wachovia, North Carolina|Wachovia]] in North Carolina had highly developed musical cultures. Choral music, Brass and String Music and Congregational singing were highly cultivated. The Moravian Church produced many composers and musicians. [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]]'s ''Creation'' had its American debut in Bethlehem in the early 19th century.\n\nThe spiritual beliefs of Johann Conrad Beissel (1690\u20131768) and the Ephrata Cloister\u2014such as the asceticism and mysticism of this Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, group - are reflected in Beissel's treatises on music and hymns, which have been considered the beginning of America's musical heritage.<ref>Lucile E. Hackett, \"Johann Conrad Beissel: Early German-American Mystic and Musician\", ''Studies in Puritan American Spirituality'' 1995 5: 95\u2013121</ref>\n\nIn most major cities, Germans took the lead in creating a musical culture, with popular bands, singing societies, operas and symphonic orchestras.<ref>Philip V.

The first began in 1855; the last folded in 1961. An important aspect of Wheeling social life, these societies reflected various social classes and enjoyed great popularity until anti-German sentiments during World War{{nbsp}}I and changing social values dealt them a death blow.<ref>Edward C. Wolf, \"Wheeling's German Singing Societies\", ''West Virginia History'' 1980\u20131981 42(1\u20132): 1\u201356</ref>\n\nThe Liederkranz, a German-American music society, played an important role in the integration of the German community into the life of [[Louisville, Kentucky]]. Started in 1848, the organization was strengthened by the arrival of German liberals after the failure of the revolution of that year. By the mid-1850s the Germans formed one-third of Louisville's population and faced nativist hostility organized in the Know-Nothing movement. Violent demonstrations forced the chorus to suppress publicity of its performances that included works by composer Richard Wagner. The Liederkranz suspended operations during the Civil War, but afterward grew rapidly, and was able to build a large auditorium by 1873. An audience of 8,000 that attended a performance in 1877 demonstrated that the Germans were an accepted part of Louisville life.<ref>Erna Ottl Gwinn, \"The Liederkranz in Louisville, 1848\u20131877\", ''Filson Club History Quarterly'' 1975 49(3): 276\u2013290,</ref>\n\nThe Imperial government in Berlin promoted German culture in the U.S., especially music. A steady influx of German-born conductors, including Arthur Nikisch and Karl Muck, spurred the reception of German music in the United States, while German musicians seized on Victorian Americans' growing concern with 'emotion'. The performance of pieces such as Beethoven's ''Ninth Symphony'' established German serious music as the superior language of feeling.<ref>Jessica C. E. Gienow-Hecht, \"Trumpeting down the Walls of Jericho: The Politics of Art, Music and Emotion in German-American Relations, 1870\u20131920\", ''Journal of Social History'' 2003 36(3): 585\u2013613,</ref>\n\n===Turners===\n[[Turners|Turner societies]] in the United States were first organized during the mid-19th century so German American immigrants could visit with one another and become involved in social and sports activities. The National Turnerbund, the head organization of the Turnvereine, started drilling members as in militia units in 1854. Nearly half of all Turners fought in the Civil War, mostly on the Union side, and a special group served as bodyguards for President Lincoln.\n\nBy the 1890s, Turners numbered nearly 65,000. At the turn of the 21st century, with the ethnic identity of European Americans in flux and Americanization a key element of immigrant life, there were few Turner groups, athletic events were limited, and non-Germans were members. A survey of surviving groups and members reflects these radical changes in the role of Turner societies and their marginalization in 21st-century American society, as younger German Americans tended not to belong, even in strongholds of German heritage in the Midwest.<ref>Annette R.

As Wittke emphasizes, press. it was \"essentially an American press published in a foreign tongue\". The papers reported on major political and diplomatic events involving Germany, with pride but from the viewpoint of its American readers.<ref>Wittke, ''The German-Language Press in America.'' p. 6</ref><ref>Shore, \"Introduction\". in ''The German-American Radical Press''.</ref> For example, during the latter half of the 19th century, at least 176 different German-language publications began operations in the city of Cincinnati alone. Many of these publications folded within a year, while a select few, such as the ''[[Cincinnati Freie Presse]]'', lasted nearly a century.<ref>Arndt, ''The German Language Press of the Americas''</ref> Other cities experienced similar turnover among immigrant publications, especially from opinion press, which published little news and focused instead on editorial commentary.<ref>Wittke, ''The German-Language Press in America''</ref>\n\nBy the end of the 19th century, there were over 800 German-language publications in the United States.<ref>La Verne Rippley, ''The German Americans'', Lanham, Maryland: University Press of America, 1984, p. 164.</ref> German immigration was on the decline, and with subsequent generations integrating into English-speaking society, the German language press began to struggle.<ref name=\"Dobbert, G.A 1914\">Dobbert, G.A. \"German-Americans between New and Old Fatherland, 1870-1914.\" ''American Quarterly''. 19.4 (1967): 663-680.</ref> The periodicals that managed to survive in immigrant communities faced an additional challenge with [[anti-German sentiment]] during World War{{nbsp}}I<ref>Shell, Marc. \"Hyphens: Between Deitsch and American.\" Multilingual America.

One example is [[Hiwwe wie Driwwe]] (Kutztown, PA), the nation's only [[Pennsylvania German]] newspaper, which was established in 1997.\n\n===Athletics===\nGermans brought organized gymnastics to America, and were strong supporters of sports programs. They used sport both to promote ethnic identity and pride and to facilitate integration into American society. Beginning in the mid-19th century, the [[Turners|Turner]] movement offered exercise and sports programs, while also providing a social haven for the thousands of new German immigrants arriving in the United States each year. Another highly successful German sports organization was the [[Buffalo Germans]] basketball team, winners of 762 games (against only 85 losses) in the early years of the 20th century. These examples, and others, reflect the evolving place of sport in the assimilation and socialization of much of the German-American population.<ref>Annette R. Hofmann, \"Between Ethnic Separation and Assimilation: German Immigrants and Their Athletic Endeavours in Their New American Home Country\", ''International Journal of the History of Sport'' 2008 25(8): 993-1009,</ref>\n\n===Religion===\n[[File:US census map of Lutheran churches - 1850.jpg|thumb|This 1850 census map shows the Lutheran population. Nearly all were German, since few Scandinavians had arrived yet.]]\n\nGerman immigrants who arrived before the 19th century tended to have been members of the Evangelical Lutheran Churches in Germany, and created the Lutheran Synods of Pennsylvania, North Carolina and New York. The largest Lutheran denominations in the U.S. today\u2014the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church in America]], the [[Lutheran Church\u2013Missouri Synod]], and the [[Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod]]\u2014are all descended from churches started by German immigrants among others. [[Calvinist]] Germans founded the [[Reformed Church in the United States]] (especially in New York and Pennsylvania), and the [[Evangelical Synod of North America]] (strongest in the Midwest), which is now part of the [[United Church of Christ]]. Many immigrants joined different churches from those that existed in Germany. Protestants often joined the [[United Methodist Church|Methodist]] church.<ref name=\"Conzen\"/> In the 1740s, [[Nicolaus Ludwig Zinzendorf|Count Nicolas von Zinzendorf]] tried to unite all the German-speaking Christians\u2014(Lutheran, Reformed, and Separatists)\u2014into one \"Church of God in the Spirit\". The [[Moravian Church]] in America is one of the results of this effort, as are the many \"Union\" churches in rural Pennsylvania.\n\nBefore 1800, communities of [[Amish]], [[Mennonite]]s, [[Schwarzenau Brethren]] and [[Moravian Church#Missions|Moravians]] had formed and are still in existence today. The Old Order Amish and a majority of the [[Old Order Mennonite]]s still speak dialects of German, including Pennsylvania German, informally known as [[Pennsylvania Dutch]]. The Amish, who were originally from southern Germany and Switzerland, arrived in Pennsylvania during the early 18th century. Amish immigration to the United States reached its peak between the years 1727 and 1770. Religious freedom was perhaps the most pressing cause for Amish immigration to Pennsylvania, which became known as a haven for persecuted religious groups.<ref name=\"The Amish\">{{Citation|url=http://religiousmovements.lib.virginia.edu/nrms/amish.html|title=The Amish|accessdate=2006-10-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061107190410/http://religiousmovements.lib.virginia.edu/nrms/amish.html|archive-date=2006-11-07|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nThe Hutterites are another example of a group of German Americans who continue a lifestyle similar to that of their ancestors. Like the Amish, they fled persecution for their religious beliefs, and came to the United States between 1874 and 1879. Today, Hutterites mostly reside in [[Montana]], [[the Dakotas]], and [[Minnesota]], and the western provinces of Canada. Hutterites continue to speak [[Hutterite German]]. Most are able to understand Standard German in addition to their dialect.<ref name=\"National Geographic, the Hutterites\">{{Citation |last=Allard |first=William Albert |year=2006 |title=Hutterite Sojourn |publisher=National Geographic Society |location=Washington, D.C.}}</ref> The German speaking [[Russian Mennonites|\"Russian\" Mennonites]] migrated during the same time as the Hutterites, but assimilated relatively quickly in the United States, whereas groups of \"Russian\" Mennonites in Canada resisted assimilation.<ref>Donald B. Kraybill and Nelson Hostetter: ''Anabaptist World USA'', 2001, Scottdale, PA, and Waterloo, ON, page 115.</ref>\n\nImmigrants from Germany in the mid-to-late-19th century brought many different religions with them. The most numerous were Lutheran or [[Catholic Church in the United States|Catholic]], although the Lutherans were themselves split among different groups. The more conservative Lutherans comprised the Lutheran Church\u2013Missouri Synod and the Wisconsin Evangelical Lutheran Synod. Other Lutherans formed various synods, most of which merged with Scandinavian-based synods in 1988, forming the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America.<ref>{{Citation|last=Almen|first=Lowell|title=One Great Cloud of Witnesses|publisher=Augsburg Fortress|location=Minneapolis|year=1997}}</ref> [[Catholic Germans]] started immigrating in large numbers in the mid to latter 19th century, spurred in particular by the ''[[Kulturkampf]]''.\n\nSome 19th-century immigrants, especially the \"Forty-Eighters\", were secular, rejecting formal religion. About 250,000 German Jews had arrived by the 1870s, and they sponsored reform synagogues in many small cities across the country. About two million Central and Eastern European Jews arrived from the 1880s to 1924, bringing more traditional religious practices.<ref>Edward S. Shapiro, \"Jews\", in Elliott Barkan, ed.

As one scholar concludes, \"The overwhelming evidence{{nbsp}}... indicates that the German-American school was a bilingual one much (perhaps a whole generation or more) earlier than 1917, and that the majority of the pupils may have been English-dominant bilinguals from the early 1880s on.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ccat.sas.upenn.edu/~haroldfs/540/handouts/gachurch/biggac.html|title=Language loyalty in the German-American Church: the Case of an Over-confident Minority.|website=Ccat.sas.upenn.edu|accessdate=17 March 2015}}</ref> By 1914, the older members attended German-language church services, while younger ones attended English services (in Lutheran, Evangelical and Catholic churches).

From 1860\u20131917, German was widely spoken in German neighborhoods; see [[German in the United States]]. There is a false belief, called the [[Muhlenberg legend]], that German was almost the official language of the U.S. There was never any such proposal. The U.S. has no [[official language]], but use of German was strongly discouraged during World War{{nbsp}}I and fell out of daily use in many places.<ref>see [http://usa.usembassy.de/germanamericans-language.htm U.S. State Department, \"German Language in the U.S\"]</ref>\n\nThere were fierce battles in Wisconsin and Illinois around 1890 regarding proposals to stop the use of German as the primary language in public and parochial schools. The [[Bennett Law]] was a highly controversial state law passed in [[Wisconsin]] in 1889 that required the use of English to teach major subjects in all public and private elementary and high schools. It affected the state's many German-language private schools (and some Norwegian schools), and was bitterly resented by German American communities. The German Catholics and Lutherans each operated large networks of [[parochial school]]s in the state. Because the language used in the classroom was German, the law meant the teachers would have to be replaced with bilingual teachers, and in most cases shut down. The Germans formed a coalition between Catholics and Lutherans, under the leadership of the Democratic Party, and the language issue produced a landslide for the Democrats, as Republicans dropped the issue until World War{{nbsp}}I. By 1917, almost all schools taught in English, but courses in German were common in areas with large German populations. These courses were permanently dropped.<ref>Robert J. Ulrich, ''The Bennett Law of Eighteen Eighty-Nine: Education and Politics in Wisconsin'' (1981).</ref>\n\n==Assimilation==\n\n===Introduction===\n\"Assimilation\" in this context means the steady loss of distinctive characteristics (especially language), as the Germans melted into a common American nationality.\n\n===The apparent disappearance of German American identity===\nGerman Americans are no longer a conspicuous ethnic group.<ref>{{cite journal|url=https://www.economist.com/united-states/2015/02/05/the-silent-minority|title=The silent minority|journal=The Economist|date=5 February 2015}}</ref> As Melvin G. Holli puts it, \"Public expression of German ethnicity is nowhere proportionate to the number of German Americans in the nation's population. Almost nowhere are German Americans as a group as visible as many smaller groups. Two examples suffice to illustrate this point: when one surveys the popular television scene of the past decade, one hears Yiddish humor done by comedians; one sees Polish, Greek, and East European detective heroes; Italian-Americans in situation comedies; and blacks such as the Jeffersons and Huxtables. But one searches in vain for quintessentially German-American characters or melodramas patterned after German-American experiences.{{nbsp}}... A second example of the virtual invisibility is that, though German Americans have been one of the largest ethnic groups in the Chicago area (numbering near one-half million between 1900 and 1910), no museum or archive exists to memorialize that fact. On the other hand, many smaller groups such as Lithuanians, Poles, Swedes, Jews, and others have museums, archives, and exhibit halls dedicated to their immigrant forefathers\".<ref name=\"Holli\">{{cite book|editor-last1=Holli|editor-first1=Melvin G.|editor-last2=Jones|editor-first2=Peter d'A.|title=Ethnic Chicago: A Multicultural Portrait|last=Holli|first=Melvin G.|chapter=German American Ethnic and Cultural Identity from 1890 Onward|chapter-url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=2JbU1d9Xil0C&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false|year=1995|publisher=William B.

Holli states that \"In 1917 the Missouri Synod's Lutheran Church conference minutes appeared in English for the first time, and the synod's new constitution dropped its insistence on using the language of [[Martin Luther|Luther]] only and instead suggested bilingualism. Dozens of Lutheran schools also dropped instruction in the German language. English-language services also intruded themselves into parishes where German had been the ''lingua franca''. Whereas only 471 congregations nationwide held English services in 1910, the number preaching in English in the synod skyrocketed to 2,492 by 1919.

The war damaged public expression of German ethnic, linguistic, and cultural institutions almost beyond repair\".<ref name=\"Holli\" />{{rp|106}} He states that, after the war, German ethnicity \"would never regain its prewar public acclaim, its larger-than-life public presence, with its symbols, rituals, and, above all, its large numbers of people who took pride in their Teutonic ancestry and enjoyed the role of Uncle Sam's favored adopted son\".<ref name=\"Holli\" />{{rp|107}} He states \"A key indicator of the decline of \"Deutschtum\" in Chicago was the census: the number identifying themselves to the census-taker as German-born plummeted from 191,000 in 1910 to 112,000 in 1920.

The German language was being taught in the schools again; the German theater still survived; and German Day celebrations were drawing larger and larger crowds. Although the assimilation process had taken its toll of pre-1914 German immigrants, a smaller group of newer postwar arrivals had developed a vocal if not impolitic interest in the rebuilding process in Germany under [[National Socialism]]. As the 1930s moved on, Hitler's brutality and Nazi excesses made Germanism once again suspect. The rise of Nazism, as Luebke notes, 'transformed German ethnicity in America into a source of social and psychological discomfort, if not distress.

As Professor Tischauser wrote, \"The notoriety gained by those who supported the German government between 1933 and 1941 cast a pall over German-Americans everywhere. Leaders of the German-American community would have great difficulty rebuilding an ethnic consciousness{{nbsp}}...

Kazal (2004) looks at Germans in Philadelphia, focusing on four ethnic subcultures: middle-class Vereinsdeutsche, working-class socialists, Lutherans, and Catholics. Each group followed a somewhat distinctive path toward assimilation. Lutherans, and the better situated Vereinsdeutsche with whom they often overlapped, after World War{{nbsp}}I abandoned the last major German characteristics and redefined themselves as old stock or as \"Nordic\" Americans, stressing their colonial roots in Pennsylvania and distancing themselves from more recent immigrants. On the other hand, working-class and Catholic Germans, groups that heavily overlapped, lived and worked with [[Irish Americans|Irish]] and other European ethnics; they also gave up German characteristics but came to identify themselves as white ethnics, distancing themselves above all from [[African American]] recent arrivals in nearby neighborhoods. Well before World War{{nbsp}}I, women in particular were becoming more and more involved in a mass consumer culture that lured them out of their German-language neighborhood shops and into English language downtown department stores. The 1920s and 1930s brought English language popular culture via movies and radio that drowned out the few surviving German language venues.<ref name=\"Kazal\">Russell A. Kazal, ''Becoming Old Stock: The Paradox of German-American Identity'' (2004).</ref>\n\n===Factors making German Americans susceptible to assimilation===\nKazal points out that German Americans have not had an experience that is especially typical of immigrant groups. \"Certainly, in a number of ways, the German-American experience was idiosyncratic. No other large immigrant group was subjected to such strong, sustained pressure to abandon its ethnic identity for an American one. None was so divided internally, a characteristic that made German Americans especially vulnerable to such pressure. Among the larger groups that immigrated in the country after 1830, none - despite regional variations - appears to have muted its ethnic identity to so great an extent.\"<ref name=\"Kazal\" />{{rp|273}} This quote from Kazal identifies both external pressures on German Americans and internal dividedness among them as reasons for their high level of assimilation.\n\nRegarding the external pressures, Kazal writes: \"The pressure imposed on German Americans to forsake their ethnic identity was extreme in both nature and duration. No other ethnic group saw its 'adoptive fatherland' twice enter a world war against its country of origin. To this stigma, the Third Reich added the lasting one of [[the Holocaust]]. In her study of ethnic identity in the 1980s, sociologist Mary Waters noted that the 'effect of the Nazi movement and World War{{nbsp}}II was still quite strong' in shaping 'popular perceptions of the German-American character', enough so that some individuals of mixed background often would acknowledge only the non-German part of their ancestry.\"<ref name=\"Kazal\" />{{rp|273}}{{efn|In the book that Kazal appears to be quoting here, Waters states \"Many people cited various political or social events as having an effect on their consciousness and degree of ethnic identity. I have already noted Laurie Jablonski's stronger identification with her Polish than with her German ancestry, a fact she attributed to the influence her surname had on how others reacted to her. When I asked about times when the relative influence of one or the other side might be stronger, she revealed that political events in Germany and Poland had a lot to do with how she chose to identify herself\".<ref name=\"Waters\">{{cite book|title=Ethnic Options: Choosing Identities in America|last=Waters|first=Mary C.|url=https://archive.org/details/ethnicoptionscho0000wate|url-access=registration|year=1990|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520070837}}</ref>{{rp|83}} Waters goes on to state that \"The association of being German with being a Nazi is still strong for Laurie, forty years after World War{{nbsp}}II. A similar story to Laurie's is related in a description by Hinda Winawer-Steiner and Norbert Wetzel of a workshop for family therapists on ethnicity and family therapy. The therapists were supposed to talk about their ethnicity and how it might influence their work. A discussion of a German-American family revealed that two of the therapists who had identified themselves as Polish-American at the beginning of the workshop were, in fact, half German. It turned out that they were suppressing their German identity because of the negative connotations associated with being German. \"When asked, one explained that she simply considered herself Polish. The other, after some reflection, said that in a group that was half Jewish, she had been reluctant to acknowledge her German heritage\" (Winawer-Steiner and Wetzel 1982, 253)\".<ref name=\"Waters\" />{{rp|84}}}} Kazal contrasts this experience with the experiences of the Japanese, Poles, Czechs, Lithuanians, Italians, east European Jews, and Irish. \"Japanese Americans, of course, suffered far more during the Second World War\",<ref name=\"Kazal\" />{{rp|273}} but until at least the 1950s, the pressure on Japanese Americans \"ran toward exclusion from, rather than inclusion in, the nation\".<ref name=\"Kazal\" />{{rp|273}} \"The state and many ordinary European Americans refused to recognize Asians as potentially American. In contrast, they pressured Germans to accept precisely that American identity in place of a German one\".<ref name=\"Kazal\" />{{rp|273}} Kazal goes on to state \"The burden of \"enemy\" status made those pressures far greater for Germans than for other European ethnic groups. To some extent, American intervention in World War{{nbsp}}I actually helped fuel ethnic nationalism in the United States among Poles, Czechs, Lithuanians, Italians, and east European Jews, who felt their desires for existing or prospective homelands stood to gain from an Allied victory. Indeed, some historians have depicted the following decade as one when immigrants transcended local or regional homeland affiliations to craft or further consolidate national identities as Poles, Czechs, and Italians. Such groups escaped the fury of \"100 percent Americanism\" during the war, in part because of their obvious stake in the defeat of the Central Powers\".<ref name=\"Kazal\" />{{rp|273 - 274}} As for Irish Americans, Kazal states that the lack of enthusiasm of many of them for helping England made them \"vulnerable to the wartime \"antihyphen\" climate\",<ref name=\"Kazal\" />{{rp|274}}, but that \"Irish nationalist activity intensified during and immediately after that war, as many Irish Americans became swept up in the events leading to the creation of the Irish Free State\",<ref name=\"Kazal\" />{{rp|274}} and that \"It made a difference for the long-term viability of Irish-American identity that the Irish homeland not only did not go to war with the United States but, in fact, emerged during the interwar years as a sovereign nation\".<ref name=\"Kazal\" />{{rp|274}}\n\nKazal then goes on to discuss the internal dividedness. He writes: \"German-American identity fell victim not only to a peculiar set of events, but also to an extraordinarily high level of internal diversity. All ethnic groups have internal divides, whether of class, religion, gender, politics, or homeland region. What distinguished German America was that it incorporated not just some but ''all'' of these divisions. Irish Americans, for example, had lost their status as primarily a proletarian group by 1900, yet they were united by religion and politics. \"Irish American\" had come to mean Irish Catholic; the vast majority of Irish Americans subscribed to some form of Irish nationalism conflated with American patriotism; and Irish-American voters were overwhelmingly Democrats. The power of this synthesis, Kerby Miller argued, explains the survival of Irish-American identity despite the ebbing of organised Irish-American nationalism after the Free State's founding. For German Americans, religion and party politics were sources of division rather than of unity\".<ref name=\"Kazal\" />{{rp|274}} Kazal goes on to state that \"The subcultures of German America, meanwhile, had ample opportunity for contact, however testy, with non-German counterparts. The latter beckoned as destinations when the cost of being German-American rose too high\".<ref name=\"Kazal\" />{{rp|274}} It is not just Kazal who has pointed out the internal dividedness of the German American community. Kathleen Neils Conzen has pointed it out; David Peterson states that Conzen, \"along with many others, concludes that German-Americans' heterogeneity, particularly in religion, hampered their ability to build socially and politically stable ethnic communities\",<ref name=\"Peterson\">{{cite journal|journal=Journal of American Ethnic History|volume=11|issue=2|pages=27\u201355|jstor = 27500930|last1 = Peterson|first1 = David|title=\"From Bone Depth\": German-American Communities in Rural Minnesota before the Great War|year=1992}}</ref>{{rp|27}} and that Conzen \"stresses that German Americans assimilated relatively rapidly and that their diversity played a key role in that assimilation\".<ref name=\"Peterson\" />{{rp|47}}{{efn|Peterson himself seems not to fully agree with this, stating \"Most community studies have examined very large, heterogeneous German-American urban populations that assimilated relatively quickly or, less commonly, large, homogeneous rural ones that did not. Hence, German-Americans' diversity has emerged as perhaps the crucial variable accounting for their assimilationist propensities. Otter Tail County, certainly a rural area, had German-American communities that were diverse and small, and these communities succeeded in maintaining crucial ethnic boundaries into the twentieth century. The persistence of these heterogeneous, lightly populated German-American communities suggest that place of residence was the key factor in the rate of German-American assimilation. Urban orientation may have corroded German-American ethnic boundaries more than diversity did, though the two variables were not unrelated\".<ref name=\"Peterson\" />{{rp|47 - 48}}}} (Conzen is also drawn upon by Joy Kristina Adams, who cites Conzen when she (Adams) states that \"The diversity and size of the German settlements made them susceptible to long-term Americanization by fostering factionalism, increasing contacts between Germans and non-Germans, and weakening unified leadership\".)<ref>[https://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/bitstream/handle/2152/2652/adamsj55244.pdf Going ''Deutsch'': Heritage Tourism and Identity in German Texas], p. 45</ref> The ''Encyclopedia of the Great Plains'' also stresses the internal dividedness, stating \"One of the distinguishing characteristics of the German population in North America (especially in comparison to other immigrant groups) has been its relative degree of cultural diversity, reflected especially in the number of Christian denominations to which Germans belonged. In part this reflects patterns that had developed over centuries in Germany, whose population came to include nearly every variety of Christianity\u2013from Catholics, Lutherans, and Reformed groups to more radical Anabaptist pietistic movements such as Amish, Mennonites, Schwenkfelders, and the Moravian church.

St. Louis served (and still does) as the seat of the Lutheran Church Missouri Synod, a conservative American Lutheran confession, and their local strength led to friction with Germans of other faiths. These Lutherans did not traffic much with the sizable German Catholic population of the city, who often shared their houses of worship and political stances with the Irish. The small rabbinical German Jewish community remained insular. The Freethinkers, atheists, socialists, et al., had little use for any of these groups. In addition, the Germans, while heavily concentrated in a few pockets of north and south St. Louis, were spread across the city proper and into the larger countryside\".<ref name=\"Baker\" />{{rp|99}} And according to the [[Max Kade]] Institute for German-American Studies, \"The diversity of religious expression among German-speaking immigrants was paralleled by a high degree of heterogeneity stemming from differences in regional and linguistic origins. This situation differed from that of other nineteenth-century immigrant groups, notably the Irish, but also Italians and people of other European backgrounds. The resulting lack of a unified and clearly definable German-American community explains in part why only few Americans, including those of German descent, have any idea when Steuben Day or German-American Day falls, whereas the Irish St. Patrick's Day is one of America's most popular celebrations, and Columbus Day, named after the Italian explorer, is a federal holiday\".<ref name=\"Max Kade Institute\">{{cite web|url=https://mki.wisc.edu/content/how-german-american-building-communities|title=How German Is American? Building Communities - Max Kade Institute|website=mki.wisc.edu}}</ref>{{efn|A similar statement about the diversity of German Americans has been made by Andrew R. L. Cayton: \"In the process of participating in the public culture of Ohio, some Germans struggled to keep connections with their birthplaces. A coherent community was difficult to maintain, however. Proud as they were of 'Deutschthum', or the sum of Germanness, it became increasingly vague. Germans were too diverse in terms of religion and politics. 'Wherever four Germans gathered,' observed the ''Deutsche Pionier'' in 1879, 'they will find four different ideas.'\"<ref>{{cite book|title=Ohio: The History of a People|last=Cayton|first=Andrew R.

They were widely dispersed throughout the Second and Third Municipalities, and in Carrollton and Lafayette, and they were fragmented by differences in religion, region of origin, and class. The proliferation of German clubs, associations, and institutions bespoke the Germans' numerical significance in the city, but it also attested to their divisions, for such organizations tended to cater to very specific groups rather than bind the various German strands together. To be sure, distinct concentrations of Germans existed in various parts of the city, wherein various German cultural values survived and influenced the culture of non-Germans in their midst, and German ''Gem\u00fctlichkeit'' was easily accommodated in the city's genial public culture. But, overall, Germans were too diverse and divided to dominate the city\".<ref name=\"Miller\" />{{rp|129}} Miller contrasts this situation with the situation of Irish Americans in New Orleans: \"Irish immigrants had greater cohesion and wider influence than the Germans. In the great waves of late antebellum immigration, the vast majority of Irish immigrants entering New Orleans came from a few select counties in Ireland. They shared a common faith, poverty, and national identity.{{nbsp}}... New Orleans was small enough so that dispersal did not diminish Irish power; in fact, Irish immigrants everywhere shared so many common cultural and class interests that dispersion served to broaden Irish influence on the city's culture\".<ref name=\"Miller\" />{{rp|129}}}}\n\n===Persistence of unassimilated German Americans===\nDespite the remarkable level of assimilation reached by German Americans, it is worth noting that a distinct German American ethnicity survived well into the mid/late-20th century in some places.
