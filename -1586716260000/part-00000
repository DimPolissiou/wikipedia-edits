Excavations at the site in 1936 revealed the ancient city, known in Greek as Besara and identified as Beth Shearim by [[Benjamin Mazar]]. The excavated part of the ancient town has become the [[Beit She'arim National Park]], which is managed by the [[Israel Nature and Parks Authority]].\n\n==Name==\nThe site is first mentioned in the writings of [[Josephus]], the 1st-century Jewish historian under the name ''Besara''.<ref name=Negev/> The Arab village was named for a Muslim saint ([[wali]]) known as Sheikh Abreik for whom a two-domed shrine was erected which is still a site of pilgrimage ([[ziyara]]).<ref name=Sharon.xxxviii/> The name translates from [[Arabic language|Arabic]] into English as \"the sheikh of the small pitcher\".<ref name=Mazarp34>Mazar, 1976, [https://books.google.com/books?lr=&cd=31&id=TH1tAAAAMAAJ&dq=sheikh+ibreik&q=%22small+pitcher%22#search_anchor p. 34].</ref> It has also been suggested that the name ''Abreik'' recalls the name of ''[[Barak]]'', the military general mentioned in the [[Bible]]'s [[Book of Judges]] as the son of [[Abinoam]].<ref name=Sharon.xxxviii>Sharon, 2004, p.

Benny notices Caroline's smart handbag, and manages to steal Caroline's wallet.  Benny then realises that he recognises Mannering as a famous surgeon. Mannering and Caroline leave shortly afterwards, followed by Benny and Molly, who is unaware of Benny's theft, but Mannering and Caroline return to the bar as they realise that the wallet was stolen by Benny, although the barman George says he did not know Benny as he had never been to the bar before.\n\nBack in his room Benny finds \u00a332 in the wallet, but also a letter from Mannering to Caroline, which makes it clear that he is having an affair with her and that his wife must not find out.  He decides to blackmail the couple, and Mannering agrees to pay him as he does not want any scandal as he is trying to get voted onto the Council of the Royal College of Surgeons.\n\nMannering agrees to meet Benny and pay \u00a3200 for the letter, but finds that he has been cheated and does not get the letter back.  Benny spends some of the money on a watch for Molly, which he says cost him \u00a360.  He then rings up Mannering again, this time asking for \u00a3300, but as he goes to the meeting he buys a gun.  When he meets Mannering they swap the money and the letter, but Benny tells Mannering, falsely, that he took a photo of the letter and has the negative, suggesting that he intends to continue blackmailing Mannering.  The latter grabs hold of Benny, but in the ensuing struggle Benny shoots Mannering dead.\n\nThe police investigation soon leads them first to Caroline, and then George, the barman at the Flamingo, who identifies Benny from police files.  They go to Benny's address but he manages to escape and goes to a crook, Rocco, to try and get out of the country.  Rocco however wants \u00a3400, so Benny decides to ask Molly to give him back the watch so that he can raise the money.  By chance however Caroline makes an appointment at the hairdressers where Molly works, and inadvertently Molly makes Caroline realise that it was her with Benny in the Flamingo that evening; she then hears a conversation between Molly and Benny on the phone, arranging a meeting at a railway bridge that evening.

The beam is deflected horizontally by applying an [[electric field]] between a pair of plates to its left and right, and vertically by applying an electric field to plates above and below. Televisions use magnetic rather than electrostatic deflection because the deflection plates obstruct the beam when the deflection angle is as large as is required for tubes that are relatively short for their size.\n\n===Phosphor persistence===\nVarious [[phosphor]]s are available depending upon the needs of the measurement or display application. The brightness, color, and persistence of the illumination depends upon the type of phosphor used on the CRT screen. Phosphors are available with persistences ranging from less than one [[microsecond]] to several seconds.<ref>{{cite book |last= Doebelin |first= Ernest |title= Measurement Systems |publisher= McGraw Hill Professional |year= 2003 |page= 972 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=q1mOopLHnTEC&pg=PA972 |isbn=978-0-07-292201-1}}</ref> For visual observation of brief transient events, a long persistence phosphor may be desirable.

Oscilloscope CRTs designed for very fast signals can give a brighter display by passing the electron beam through a [[micro-channel plate]] just before it reaches the screen. Through the phenomenon of [[secondary emission]], this plate multiplies the number of electrons reaching the phosphor screen, giving a significant improvement in writing rate (brightness) and improved sensitivity and spot size as well.<ref>{{cite book |last= Williams |first= Jim |title= Analog circuit design: art, science, and personalities |publisher= Newnes |year= 1991 |pages= 115\u2013116 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=CFoEAP2lwLEC&pg=PA115 |isbn= 978-0-7506-9640-1}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author1=Yen, William M. |author2=Shionoya, Shigeo |author3=Yamamoto, Hajime |title= Practical Applications of Phosphors |publisher= CRC Press |year= 2006 |page= 211 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=cKMSf0iRVSgC&pg=PA211 |isbn=978-1-4200-4369-3}}</ref>\n\n===Graticules===\nMost oscilloscopes have a [[oscilloscope#Graticule|graticule]] as part of the visual display, to facilitate measurements.

These are distinct from ''[[digital storage oscilloscope]]s'' which rely on solid state digital memory to store the image.\n\nWhere a single brief event is monitored by an oscilloscope, such an event will be displayed by a conventional tube only while it actually occurs. The use of a long persistence phosphor may allow the image to be observed after the event, but only for a few seconds at best. This limitation can be overcome by the use of a direct view storage cathode-ray tube (storage tube). A storage tube will continue to display the event after it has occurred until such time as it is erased. A storage tube is similar to a conventional tube except that it is equipped with a metal grid coated with a [[dielectric]] layer located immediately behind the phosphor screen. An externally applied voltage to the mesh initially ensures that the whole mesh is at a constant potential. This mesh is constantly exposed to a low velocity electron beam from a 'flood gun' which operates independently of the main gun. This flood gun is not deflected like the main gun but constantly 'illuminates' the whole of the storage mesh. The initial charge on the storage mesh is such as to repel the electrons from the flood gun which are prevented from striking the phosphor screen.\n\nWhen the main electron gun writes an image to the screen, the energy in the main beam is sufficient to create a 'potential relief' on the storage mesh. The areas where this relief is created no longer repel the electrons from the flood gun which now pass through the mesh and illuminate the phosphor screen. Consequently, the image that was briefly traced out by the main gun continues to be displayed after it has occurred. The image can be 'erased' by resupplying the external voltage to the mesh restoring its constant potential. The time for which the image can be displayed was limited because, in practice, the flood gun slowly neutralises the charge on the storage mesh. One way of allowing the image to be retained for longer is temporarily to turn off the flood gun. It is then possible for the image to be retained for several days. The majority of storage tubes allow for a lower voltage to be applied to the storage mesh which slowly restores the initial charge state. By varying this voltage a variable persistence is obtained. Turning off the flood gun and the voltage supply to the storage mesh allows such a tube to operate as a conventional oscilloscope tube.<ref>The [[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]], 3rd Edition (1970\u20131979)</ref>\n\n==Color CRTs==\n[[File:CRT screen. closeup.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Magnified view of a delta-gun [[shadow mask]] color CRT]]\n[[File:CRT Phosphors.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Magnified view of a [[Trinitron]] color CRT]]\n[[File:CRT_phosphors.png|thumb|right|Spectra of constituent blue, green and red phosphors in a common CRT]]\nColor tubes use three different phosphors which emit red, green, and blue light respectively.

A grille or mask absorbs the electrons that would otherwise hit the wrong phosphor.<ref name=maskgrill>{{cite web |url=http://www.pcguide.com/ref/crt/crtMask-c.html |title=The Shadow Mask and Aperture Grill |work=PC Guide |access-date=4 October 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100102114333/http://pcguide.com/ref/crt/crtMask-c.html |archive-date=2 January 2010 |url-status=dead }}</ref> A [[shadow mask]] tube uses a metal plate with tiny holes, placed so that the electron beam only illuminates the correct phosphors on the face of the tube;<ref name=crtmonitorwork/> the holes are tapered so that the electrons that strike the inside of any hole will be reflected back, if they are not absorbed (e.g. due to local charge accumulation), instead of bouncing through the hole to strike a random (wrong) spot on the screen. Another type of color CRT uses an [[aperture grille]] of tensioned vertical wires to achieve the same result.<ref name=maskgrill/>\n\n===Convergence and purity in color CRTs===\nDue to limitations in the dimensional precision with which CRTs can be manufactured economically, it has not been practically possible to build color CRTs in which three electron beams could be aligned to hit phosphors of respective color in acceptable coordination, solely on the basis of the geometric configuration of the electron gun axes and gun aperture positions, shadow mask apertures, etc. The shadow mask ensures that one beam will only hit spots of certain colors of phosphors, but minute variations in physical alignment of the internal parts among individual CRTs will cause variations in the exact alignment of the beams through the shadow mask, allowing some electrons from, for example, the red beam to hit, say, blue phosphors, unless some individual compensation is made for the variance among individual tubes.\n\nColor convergence and color purity are two aspects of this single problem. Firstly, for correct color rendering it is necessary that regardless of where the beams are deflected on the screen, all three hit the same spot (and nominally pass through the same hole or slot) on the shadow mask.{{clarify|reason=See Talk page for apparent contradiction|date=August 2019}} This is called convergence.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ultimateavmag.com/howto/305picture/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091126054428/http://www.ultimateavmag.com/howto/305picture/|archivedate=26 November 2009|title=Picture This|date=March 2005|author=Norton, Thomas J. |work= UltimateAVmag.com}}</ref> More specifically, the convergence at the center of the screen (with no deflection field applied by the yoke) is called static convergence, and the convergence over the rest of the screen area is called dynamic convergence. The beams may converge at the center of the screen and yet stray from each other as they are deflected toward the edges; such a CRT would be said to have good static convergence but poor dynamic convergence. Secondly, each beam must only strike the phosphors of the color it is intended to strike and no others. This is called purity. Like convergence, there is static purity and dynamic purity, with the same meanings of \"static\" and \"dynamic\" as for convergence. Convergence and purity are distinct parameters; a CRT could have good purity but poor convergence, or vice versa. Poor convergence causes color \"shadows\" or \"ghosts\" along displayed edges and contours, as if the image on the screen were [[Intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio printed]] with poor registration. Poor purity causes objects on the screen to appear off-color while their edges remain sharp. Purity and convergence problems can occur at the same time, in the same or different areas of the screen or both over the whole screen, and either uniformly or to greater or lesser degrees over different parts of the screen.\n\n[[File:Magnet on TV.webm|thumb|A magnet used on a CRT TV. Note the distortion of the image.]]\nThe solution to the static convergence and purity problems is a set of color alignment magnets installed around the neck of the CRT. These movable weak permanent magnets are usually mounted on the back end of the deflection yoke assembly and are set at the factory to compensate for any static purity and convergence errors that are intrinsic to the unadjusted tube. Typically there are two or three pairs of two magnets in the form of rings made of plastic impregnated with a magnetic material, with their [[magnetic fields]] parallel to the planes of the magnets, which are perpendicular to the electron gun axes. Each pair of magnetic rings forms a single effective magnet whose field [[vector field|vector]] can be fully and freely adjusted (in both direction and magnitude). By rotating a pair of magnets relative to each other, their relative field alignment can be varied, adjusting the effective field strength of the pair. (As they rotate relative to each other, each magnet's field can be considered to have two opposing components at right angles, and these four components [two each for two magnets] form two pairs, one pair reinforcing each other and the other pair opposing and canceling each other. Rotating away from alignment, the magnets' mutually reinforcing field components decrease as they are traded for increasing opposed, mutually cancelling components.) By rotating a pair of magnets together, preserving the relative angle between them, the direction of their collective magnetic field can be varied. Overall, adjusting all of the convergence/purity magnets allows a finely tuned slight electron beam deflection or lateral offset to be applied, which compensates for minor static convergence and purity errors intrinsic to the uncalibrated tube. Once set, these magnets are usually glued in place, but normally they can be freed and readjusted in the field (e.g. by a TV repair shop) if necessary.\n\nOn some CRTs, additional fixed adjustable magnets are added for dynamic convergence or dynamic purity at specific points on the screen, typically near the corners or edges. Further adjustment of dynamic convergence and purity typically cannot be done passively, but requires active compensation circuits.\n\nDynamic color convergence and purity are one of the main reasons why until late in their history, CRTs were long-necked (deep) and had biaxially curved faces; these geometric design characteristics are necessary for intrinsic passive dynamic color convergence and purity. Only starting around the 1990s did sophisticated active dynamic convergence compensation circuits become available that made short-necked and flat-faced CRTs workable. These active compensation circuits use the deflection yoke to finely adjust beam deflection according to the beam target location. The same techniques (and major circuit components) also make possible the adjustment of display image rotation, skew, and other complex [[raster graphics|raster]] geometry parameters through electronics under user control.\n\n===Degaussing===\n[[File:Degauss in progress.jpg|thumb|256px|A degaussing in progress.]]\nIf the shadow mask or aperture grille becomes magnetized, its magnetic field alters the paths of the electron beams. This causes errors of \"color purity\" as the electrons no longer follow only their intended paths, and some will hit some phosphors of colors other than the one intended. For example, some electrons from the red beam may hit blue or green phosphors, imposing a magenta or yellow tint to parts of the image that are supposed to be pure red. (This effect is localized to a specific area of the screen if the magnetization is localized.) Therefore, it is important that the shadow mask or aperture grille not be magnetized. \n\nMost color CRT displays, i.e. television sets and computer monitors, each have a built-in [[degaussing]] (demagnetizing) circuit, the primary component of which is a degaussing coil which is mounted around the perimeter of the CRT face inside the [[wikt:bezel|bezel]]. Upon power-up of the CRT display, the degaussing circuit produces a brief, alternating current through the degaussing coil which smoothly decays in strength (fades out) to zero over a period of a few seconds, producing a decaying alternating magnetic field from the coil. This degaussing field is strong enough to remove shadow mask magnetization in most cases.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pcguide.com/ref/crt/crtGauss-c.html|title=Magnetization and Degaussing|accessdate=4 October 2009}}</ref> In unusual cases of strong magnetization where the internal degaussing field is not sufficient, the shadow mask may be degaussed externally with a stronger portable degausser or demagnetizer. However, an excessively strong magnetic field, whether alternating or constant, may mechanically [[deformation (engineering)|deform]] (bend) the shadow mask, causing a permanent color distortion on the display which looks very similar to a magnetization effect.\n\nThe degaussing circuit is often built of a [[Thermo-Electricity|thermo-electric]] (not electronic) device containing a small ceramic heating element and a positive thermal [[coefficient of thermal expansion|coefficient]] (PTC) [[resistor-capacitor circuit|resistor]], connected directly to the switched [[AC power]] line with the resistor in series with the degaussing coil. When the power is switched on, the heating element heats the PTC resistor, increasing its resistance to a point where degaussing current is minimal, but not actually zero. In older CRT displays, this low-level current (which produces no significant degaussing field) is sustained along with the action of the heating element as long as the display remains switched on. To repeat a degaussing cycle, the CRT display must be switched off and left off for at least several seconds to reset the degaussing circuit by allowing the PTC resistor to cool to the [[ambient temperature]]; switching the display-off and immediately back on will result in a weak degaussing cycle or effectively no degaussing cycle.\n\nThis simple design is effective and cheap to build, but it wastes some power continuously. Later models, especially [[Energy Star]] rated ones, use a [[relay]] to switch the entire degaussing circuit on and off, so that the degaussing circuit uses energy only when it is functionally active and needed. The relay design also enables degaussing on user demand through the unit's front panel controls, without switching the unit off and on again. This relay can often be heard clicking off at the end of the degaussing cycle a few seconds after the monitor is turned on, and on and off during a manually initiated degaussing cycle.\n\nAt high refresh rates and resolutions, the deflection coil/yoke starts to produce large amounts of heat, due to the need to quickly move the electron beam (because the electron beam has to scan more lines per second), which in turn requires large amounts of power, for quickly generating strong magnetic fields. This makes CRTs beyond certain resolutions and refresh rates impractical, since the coils would need active cooling, to prevent the heat from the coils  from melting the glue that is used to attach them to the neck of the CRT.\n\n==Vector monitors==\n{{Main|Vector monitor}}\nVector monitors were used in early computer aided design systems and are in some late-1970s to mid-1980s arcade games such as ''[[Asteroids (video game)|Asteroids]]''.<ref>{{cite book |title= Supercade: A Visual History of the Videogame Age, 1971\u20131984 |author= Van Burnham |publisher= MIT Press |year= 2001 |isbn= 0-262-52420-1}}</ref>\nThey draw graphics point-to-point, rather than scanning a raster. Either monochrome or color CRTs can be used in vector displays, and the essential principles of CRT design and operation are the same for either type of display; the main difference is in the beam deflection patterns and circuits.\n\n==CRT resolution==\n[[Dot pitch]] defines the maximum resolution of the display, assuming delta-gun CRTs. In these, as the scanned resolution approaches the dot pitch resolution, [[moir\u00e9]] appears, as the detail being displayed is finer than what the shadow mask can render.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.displaymate.com/moire.html |title= Moir\u00e9 Interference Patterns |accessdate=4 October 2006 |work=DisplayMate Technologies website}}</ref> Aperture grille monitors do not suffer from vertical moir\u00e9; however, because their phosphor stripes have no vertical detail. In smaller CRTs, these strips maintain position by themselves, but larger aperture-grille CRTs require one or two crosswise (horizontal) support strips.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://computer.howstuffworks.com/question406.htm |title=What causes the faint horizontal lines on my monitor? |accessdate=4 October 2009 |work=HowStuffWorks}}</ref>\n\n==Gamma==\nCRTs have a pronounced [[triode]] characteristic, which results in significant [[gamma correction|gamma]] (a nonlinear relationship in an electron gun between applied video voltage and beam intensity).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://broadcastengineering.com/newsrooms/broadcasting_gamma_correction/ |title=Gamma correction |accessdate=4 October 2009 |last=Robin |first=Michael |date=1 January 2005 |work=BroadcastEngineering |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090531130845/http://broadcastengineering.com/newsrooms/broadcasting_gamma_correction/ |archivedate=31 May 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Other types==\n===Data storage tubes===\n{{Main|Williams tube}}\nThe Williams tube or Williams-Kilburn tube was a cathode-ray tube used to electronically store binary data. It was used in computers of the 1940s as a random-access digital storage device. In contrast to other CRTs in this article, the Williams tube was not a display device, and in fact could not be viewed since a metal plate covered its screen.\n\n===Cat's eye===\n{{Main|Magic eye tube}}\nIn some [[vacuum tube]] radio sets, a [[Magic eye tube|\"Magic Eye\" or \"Tuning Eye\" tube]] was provided to assist in tuning the receiver. Tuning would be adjusted until the width of a radial shadow was minimized. This was used instead of a more expensive electromechanical meter, which later came to be used on higher-end tuners when transistor sets lacked the high voltage required to drive the device.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vacuumtube.com/eyetubes.htm |title=Tuning-Eye Tubes |accessdate=1 December 2009 |publisher=vacuumtube.com |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090423055711/http://www.vacuumtube.com/eyetubes.htm |archivedate=23 April 2009}}</ref> The same type of device was used with tape recorders as a recording level meter, and for various other applications including electrical test equipment.\n\n===Charactrons===\n{{Main|Charactron}}\nSome displays for early computers (those that needed to display more text than was practical using vectors, or that required high speed for photographic output) used Charactron CRTs. These incorporate a perforated metal character mask ([[stencil]]), which shapes a wide electron beam to form a character on the screen. The system selects a character on the mask using one set of deflection circuits, but that causes the extruded beam to be aimed off-axis, so a second set of deflection plates has to re-aim the beam so it is headed toward the center of the screen. A third set of plates places the character wherever required. The beam is unblanked (turned on) briefly to draw the character at that position. Graphics could be drawn by selecting the position on the mask corresponding to the code for a space (in practice, they were simply not drawn), which had a small round hole in the center; this effectively disabled the character mask, and the system reverted to regular vector behavior. Charactrons had exceptionally long necks, because of the need for three deflection systems.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.google.com/patents?vid=2735956|title=Cathode ray apparatus|accessdate=4 October 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.google.com/patents?vid=2824250|title=INPUT|accessdate=4 October 2009}}</ref>\n\n===Nimo===\n{{Main|Nimo tube}}\n[[File:Nimo tube BA0000-P31 showing digit 9.jpg|thumb|right|Nimo tube BA0000-P31]]\nNimo was the trademark of a family of small specialised CRTs manufactured by Industrial Electronics Engineers. These had 10 electron guns which produced electron beams in the form of digits in a manner similar to that of the charactron. The tubes were either simple single-digit displays or more complex 4- or 6- digit displays produced by means of a suitable magnetic deflection system. Having little of the complexities of a standard CRT, the tube required a relatively simple driving circuit, and as the image was projected on the glass face, it provided a much wider viewing angle than competitive types (e.g., [[nixie tube]]s).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tube-tester.com/sites/nixie/dat_arch/BA0000-P31.pdf |title=IEE Nimo CRT 10-gun readout tube datasheet |format=PDF |work=tube-tester.com|accessdate=1 December 2009}}</ref>\n\n===Flood beam CRT===\n{{Main|Electron-stimulated luminescence}}\nFlood beam CRTs are small tubes that are arranged as pixels for large screens like [[Jumbotron]]s. The first screen using this technology was introduced by [[Mitsubishi Electric]] for the [[1980 Major League Baseball All-Star Game]]. It differs from a normal CRT in that the electron gun within does not produce a focused controllable beam. Instead, electrons are sprayed in a wide cone across the entire front of the phosphor screen, basically making each unit act as a single light bulb.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.decadecounter.com/vta/articleview.php?item=947|title= Futaba TL-3508XA 'Jumbotron' Display|date= 11 March 2010|accessdate= 2014-12-19|website= The Vintage Technology Association: Military Industrial Electronics Research Preservation|publisher= The Vintage Technology Association}}</ref> Each one is coated with a red, green or blue phosphor, to make up the color sub-pixels.

The [[Food and Drug Administration]] regulations in {{CodeFedReg|21|1020|10}} are used to strictly limit, for instance, television receivers to 0.5 [[Roentgen (unit)|milliroentgens]] per hour (mR/h) (0.13&nbsp;\u00b5C/(kg\u00b7h) or 36&nbsp;pA/kg) at a distance of {{convert|5|cm|0|abbr=on}} from any external surface; since 2007, most CRTs have emissions that fall well below this limit.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?fr=1020.10 |title=Subchapter J, Radiological Health (21CFR1020.10) |publisher=U.S. Food and Drug Administration |date=1 April 2006 |accessdate=13 August 2007}}</ref>\n\n===Toxicity===\nOlder color and monochrome CRTs may have been manufactured with toxic substances, such as [[cadmium]], in the phosphors.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://takebackmytv.com/pages/toxic_tvs |title=Toxic TVs |accessdate=13 April 2010 |publisher=Electronics TakeBack Coalition |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227041627/http://takebackmytv.com/pages/toxic_tvs |archivedate=27 February 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://e-stewards.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/OccupationalRisksCRTGlassProcessing1.pdf |title=Occupational Risks Associated with Electronics Demanufacturing and CRT Glass Processing Operations and the Impact of Mitigation Activities on Employee Safety and Health |accessdate=20 January 2011 |author1=Peters-Michaud, Neil |author2=Katers, John |author3=Barry, Jim |format=PDF |work=Cascade Asset Management, LLC |publisher=Basel Action Network |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726012352/http://e-stewards.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/OccupationalRisksCRTGlassProcessing1.pdf |archivedate=26 July 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.americanelements.com/cdm.html |title=Cadmium |accessdate=13 April 2010 |publisher=[[American Elements]]}}</ref> The rear glass tube of modern CRTs may be made from [[lead glass|leaded glass]], which represent an environmental hazard if disposed of improperly.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hinkleycenter.com/publications/lead_leachability_99-5.pdf |title=Characterization of Lead Leachability from Cathode Ray Tubes Using the Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure |accessdate=4 October 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222012228/http://www.hinkleycenter.com/publications/lead_leachability_99-5.pdf |archivedate=22 February 2014}}</ref> By the time personal computers were produced, glass in the front panel (the viewable portion of the CRT) used barium rather than lead,{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}} though the rear of the CRT was still produced from leaded glass. Monochrome CRTs typically do not contain enough leaded glass to fail EPA TCLP tests. While the TCLP process grinds the glass into fine particles in order to expose them to weak acids to test for leachate, intact CRT glass does not leach (The lead is vitrified, contained inside the glass itself, similar to leaded glass crystalware).\n\n=== Recycling ===\nDue to the toxins contained in CRT monitors the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] created rules (in October 2001) stating that CRTs must be brought to special [[Electronic waste|e-waste recycling]] facilities. In November 2002, the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] began fining companies that disposed of CRTs through [[landfill]]s or [[incineration]]. Regulatory agencies, local and statewide, monitor the disposal of CRTs and other computer equipment.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.epa.gov/osw/hazard/recycling/electron/index.htm|title=Final Rules on Cathode Ray Tubes and Discarded Mercury-Containing Equipment|accessdate=4 October 2009}}</ref>\n\nVarious states participate in the recycling of CRTs, each with their reporting requirements for collectors and recycling facilities. For example, in California the recycling of CRTs is governed by CALRecycle, the California Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery through their Payment System. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.calrecycle.ca.gov/electronics/cew|title=Covered Electronic Waste Payment System|first=State of|last=California|website=www.calrecycle.ca.gov}}</ref>.

Flicker is commonly associated with CRT as most televisions run at 50&nbsp;Hz (PAL) or 60&nbsp;Hz (NTSC), although there are some 100&nbsp;Hz PAL televisions that are [[flicker-free]].

If the persistence is too long on a video display, moving images will be blurred.\n\n===High-frequency audible noise===\n50&nbsp;Hz/60&nbsp;Hz CRTs used for television operate with horizontal scanning frequencies of 15,734&nbsp;Hz (for [[NTSC]] systems) or 15,625&nbsp;Hz (for [[PAL]] systems).<ref>{{cite book |last= Netravali |first= Arun N. |author2=Haskell, Barry G. |title= Digital pictures: representation, compression, and standards |publisher= Plenum Publishing Corporation |year= 1995 |page= 100 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=-TXYfZrCBuQC&pg=PA100 |isbn=978-0-306-44917-8}}</ref> These frequencies are at the upper range of [[human hearing]] and are inaudible to many people; however, some people (especially children) will perceive a high-pitched tone near an operating television CRT.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pcguide.com/ts/x/comp/crt/failWhine-c.html |title=The monitor is producing a high-pitched whine |accessdate=4 October 2009}}</ref> The sound is due to [[magnetostriction]] in the magnetic core and periodic movement of windings of the [[flyback transformer]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Rhys-Jones |first1=J. |title=Television economics |journal=Radiotronics |date=February 1951 |volume=16 |issue=2 |page=37}}</ref>\n\nThis problem does not occur on 100/120&nbsp;Hz TVs and on non-CGA (Color Graphics Adapter) computer displays, because they use much higher horizontal scanning frequencies (22&nbsp;kHz to over 100&nbsp;kHz).\n\n===Implosion===\nHigh [[vacuum]] inside glass-walled cathode-ray tubes permits electron beams to fly freely\u2014without colliding into molecules of air or other gas.

This is many times greater than household power supply voltage. Even after the power supply is turned off, some associated capacitors and the CRT itself may retain  a charge for some time and therefore dissipate that charge suddenly through a ground such as an inattentive human grounding a capacitor  discharge lead.\n\n==Security concerns==\nUnder some circumstances, the signal radiated from the [[electron gun]]s, scanning circuitry, and associated wiring of a CRT can be captured remotely and used to reconstruct what is shown on the CRT using a process called [[Van Eck phreaking]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://jya.com/emr.pdf|title=Electromagnetic Radiation from Video Display Units: An Eavesdropping Risk?|accessdate=4 October 2009}}</ref> Special [[TEMPEST]] shielding can mitigate this effect.

As a matter of safety, the face is typically made of thick [[lead glass]] so as to be highly shatter-resistant and to block most [[X-ray]] emissions, particularly if the CRT is used in a consumer product.\n\nSince the late 2000s, CRTs have been largely superseded by newer \"[[flat panel]]\" display technologies such as [[liquid-crystal display|LCD]], [[plasma display]], and [[OLED]] displays. In the case of LCD and OLED displays, initial picture quality when they were first adapted wasn't as good. However, as the technology has developed, these displays now provide images of higher quality than CRT, with lower manufacturing costs and power consumption, as well as significantly less weight and bulk.

Oscilloscope CRTs designed for very fast signals can give a brighter display by passing the electron beam through a [[micro-channel plate]] just before it reaches the screen. Through the phenomenon of [[secondary emission]], this plate multiplies the number of electrons reaching the phosphor screen, giving a significant improvement in writing rate (brightness) and improved sensitivity and spot size as well.<ref>{{cite book |last= Williams |first= Jim |title= Analog circuit design: art, science, and personalities |publisher= Newnes |year= 1991 |pages= 115\u2013116 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=CFoEAP2lwLEC&pg=PA115 |isbn= 978-0-7506-9640-1}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |author1=Yen, William M. |author2=Shionoya, Shigeo |author3=Yamamoto, Hajime |title= Practical Applications of Phosphors |publisher= CRC Press |year= 2006 |page= 211 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=cKMSf0iRVSgC&pg=PA211 |isbn=978-1-4200-4369-3}}</ref>\n\n===Graticules===\nMost oscilloscopes have a [[oscilloscope#Graticule|graticule]] as part of the visual display, to facilitate measurements.

These are distinct from ''[[digital storage oscilloscope]]s'' which rely on solid state digital memory to store the image.\n\nWhere a single brief event is monitored by an oscilloscope, such an event will be displayed by a conventional tube only while it actually occurs. The use of a long persistence phosphor may allow the image to be observed after the event, but only for a few seconds at best. This limitation can be overcome by the use of a direct view storage cathode-ray tube (storage tube). A storage tube will continue to display the event after it has occurred until such time as it is erased. A storage tube is similar to a conventional tube except that it is equipped with a metal grid coated with a [[dielectric]] layer located immediately behind the phosphor screen. An externally applied voltage to the mesh initially ensures that the whole mesh is at a constant potential. This mesh is constantly exposed to a low velocity electron beam from a 'flood gun' which operates independently of the main gun. This flood gun is not deflected like the main gun but constantly 'illuminates' the whole of the storage mesh. The initial charge on the storage mesh is such as to repel the electrons from the flood gun which are prevented from striking the phosphor screen.\n\nWhen the main electron gun writes an image to the screen, the energy in the main beam is sufficient to create a 'potential relief' on the storage mesh. The areas where this relief is created no longer repel the electrons from the flood gun which now pass through the mesh and illuminate the phosphor screen. Consequently, the image that was briefly traced out by the main gun continues to be displayed after it has occurred. The image can be 'erased' by resupplying the external voltage to the mesh restoring its constant potential. The time for which the image can be displayed was limited because, in practice, the flood gun slowly neutralises the charge on the storage mesh. One way of allowing the image to be retained for longer is temporarily to turn off the flood gun. It is then possible for the image to be retained for several days. The majority of storage tubes allow for a lower voltage to be applied to the storage mesh which slowly restores the initial charge state. By varying this voltage a variable persistence is obtained. Turning off the flood gun and the voltage supply to the storage mesh allows such a tube to operate as a conventional oscilloscope tube.<ref>The [[Great Soviet Encyclopedia]], 3rd Edition (1970\u20131979)</ref>\n\n==Color CRTs==\n[[File:CRT screen. closeup.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Magnified view of a delta-gun [[shadow mask]] color CRT]]\n[[File:CRT Phosphors.jpg|right|thumb|150px|Magnified view of a [[Trinitron]] color CRT]]\n[[File:CRT_phosphors.png|thumb|right|Spectra of constituent blue, green and red phosphors in a common CRT]]\nColor tubes use three different phosphors which emit red, green, and blue light respectively. They are packed together in stripes (as in [[aperture grille]] designs) or clusters called [[Triad (monitors)|\"triads\"]] (as in [[shadow mask]] CRTs).<ref name=crtmonitorwork>{{cite web |url=http://www.bit-tech.net/hardware/2006/03/20/how_crt_and_lcd_monitors_work/1 |title=How CRT and LCD monitors work |accessdate=4 October 2009 |work=bit-tech.net}}</ref> Color CRTs have three electron guns, one for each primary color, arranged either in a straight line or in an [[equilateral triangle|equilateral triangular]] configuration (the guns are usually constructed as a single unit). (The triangular configuration is often called \"delta-gun\", based on its relation to the shape of the Greek letter delta \u0394.)

Another type of color CRT uses an [[aperture grille]] of tensioned vertical wires to achieve the same result.<ref name=maskgrill/>\n\n===Convergence and purity in color CRTs===\nDue to limitations in the dimensional precision with which CRTs can be manufactured economically, it has not been practically possible to build color CRTs in which three electron beams could be aligned to hit phosphors of respective color in acceptable coordination, solely on the basis of the geometric configuration of the electron gun axes and gun aperture positions, shadow mask apertures, etc. The shadow mask ensures that one beam will only hit spots of certain colors of phosphors, but minute variations in physical alignment of the internal parts among individual CRTs will cause variations in the exact alignment of the beams through the shadow mask, allowing some electrons from, for example, the red beam to hit, say, blue phosphors, unless some individual compensation is made for the variance among individual tubes.\n\nColor convergence and color purity are two aspects of this single problem. Firstly, for correct color rendering it is necessary that regardless of where the beams are deflected on the screen, all three hit the same spot (and nominally pass through the same hole or slot) on the shadow mask.{{clarify|reason=See Talk page for apparent contradiction|date=August 2019}} This is called convergence.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.ultimateavmag.com/howto/305picture/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091126054428/http://www.ultimateavmag.com/howto/305picture/|archivedate=26 November 2009|title=Picture This|date=March 2005|author=Norton, Thomas J. |work= UltimateAVmag.com}}</ref> More specifically, the convergence at the center of the screen (with no deflection field applied by the yoke) is called static convergence, and the convergence over the rest of the screen area is called dynamic convergence. The beams may converge at the center of the screen and yet stray from each other as they are deflected toward the edges; such a CRT would be said to have good static convergence but poor dynamic convergence. Secondly, each beam must only strike the phosphors of the color it is intended to strike and no others. This is called purity. Like convergence, there is static purity and dynamic purity, with the same meanings of \"static\" and \"dynamic\" as for convergence. Convergence and purity are distinct parameters; a CRT could have good purity but poor convergence, or vice versa. Poor convergence causes color \"shadows\" or \"ghosts\" along displayed edges and contours, as if the image on the screen were [[Intaglio (printmaking)|intaglio printed]] with poor registration. Poor purity causes objects on the screen to appear off-color while their edges remain sharp. Purity and convergence problems can occur at the same time, in the same or different areas of the screen or both over the whole screen, and either uniformly or to greater or lesser degrees over different parts of the screen.\n\n[[File:Magnet on TV.webm|thumb|A magnet used on a CRT TV. Note the distortion of the image.]]\nThe solution to the static convergence and purity problems is a set of color alignment magnets installed around the neck of the CRT. These movable weak permanent magnets are usually mounted on the back end of the deflection yoke assembly and are set at the factory to compensate for any static purity and convergence errors that are intrinsic to the unadjusted tube. Typically there are two or three pairs of two magnets in the form of rings made of plastic impregnated with a magnetic material, with their [[magnetic fields]] parallel to the planes of the magnets, which are perpendicular to the electron gun axes. Each pair of magnetic rings forms a single effective magnet whose field [[vector field|vector]] can be fully and freely adjusted (in both direction and magnitude). By rotating a pair of magnets relative to each other, their relative field alignment can be varied, adjusting the effective field strength of the pair. (As they rotate relative to each other, each magnet's field can be considered to have two opposing components at right angles, and these four components [two each for two magnets] form two pairs, one pair reinforcing each other and the other pair opposing and canceling each other. Rotating away from alignment, the magnets' mutually reinforcing field components decrease as they are traded for increasing opposed, mutually cancelling components.) By rotating a pair of magnets together, preserving the relative angle between them, the direction of their collective magnetic field can be varied. Overall, adjusting all of the convergence/purity magnets allows a finely tuned slight electron beam deflection or lateral offset to be applied, which compensates for minor static convergence and purity errors intrinsic to the uncalibrated tube. Once set, these magnets are usually glued in place, but normally they can be freed and readjusted in the field (e.g. by a TV repair shop) if necessary.\n\nOn some CRTs, additional fixed adjustable magnets are added for dynamic convergence or dynamic purity at specific points on the screen, typically near the corners or edges. Further adjustment of dynamic convergence and purity typically cannot be done passively, but requires active compensation circuits.\n\nDynamic color convergence and purity are one of the main reasons why until late in their history, CRTs were long-necked (deep) and had biaxially curved faces; these geometric design characteristics are necessary for intrinsic passive dynamic color convergence and purity. Only starting around the 1990s did sophisticated active dynamic convergence compensation circuits become available that made short-necked and flat-faced CRTs workable. These active compensation circuits use the deflection yoke to finely adjust beam deflection according to the beam target location. The same techniques (and major circuit components) also make possible the adjustment of display image rotation, skew, and other complex [[raster graphics|raster]] geometry parameters through electronics under user control.\n\n===Degaussing===\n[[File:Degauss in progress.jpg|thumb|256px|A degaussing in progress.]]\nIf the shadow mask or aperture grille becomes magnetized, its magnetic field alters the paths of the electron beams. This causes errors of \"color purity\" as the electrons no longer follow only their intended paths, and some will hit some phosphors of colors other than the one intended. For example, some electrons from the red beam may hit blue or green phosphors, imposing a magenta or yellow tint to parts of the image that are supposed to be pure red. (This effect is localized to a specific area of the screen if the magnetization is localized.) Therefore, it is important that the shadow mask or aperture grille not be magnetized. \n\nMost color CRT displays, i.e. television sets and computer monitors, each have a built-in [[degaussing]] (demagnetizing) circuit, the primary component of which is a degaussing coil which is mounted around the perimeter of the CRT face inside the [[wikt:bezel|bezel]]. Upon power-up of the CRT display, the degaussing circuit produces a brief, alternating current through the degaussing coil which smoothly decays in strength (fades out) to zero over a period of a few seconds, producing a decaying alternating magnetic field from the coil. This degaussing field is strong enough to remove shadow mask magnetization in most cases.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pcguide.com/ref/crt/crtGauss-c.html|title=Magnetization and Degaussing|accessdate=4 October 2009}}</ref> In unusual cases of strong magnetization where the internal degaussing field is not sufficient, the shadow mask may be degaussed externally with a stronger portable degausser or demagnetizer. However, an excessively strong magnetic field, whether alternating or constant, may mechanically [[deformation (engineering)|deform]] (bend) the shadow mask, causing a permanent color distortion on the display which looks very similar to a magnetization effect.\n\nThe degaussing circuit is often built of a [[Thermo-Electricity|thermo-electric]] (not electronic) device containing a small ceramic heating element and a positive thermal [[coefficient of thermal expansion|coefficient]] (PTC) [[resistor-capacitor circuit|resistor]], connected directly to the switched [[AC power]] line with the resistor in series with the degaussing coil. When the power is switched on, the heating element heats the PTC resistor, increasing its resistance to a point where degaussing current is minimal, but not actually zero. In older CRT displays, this low-level current (which produces no significant degaussing field) is sustained along with the action of the heating element as long as the display remains switched on. To repeat a degaussing cycle, the CRT display must be switched off and left off for at least several seconds to reset the degaussing circuit by allowing the PTC resistor to cool to the [[ambient temperature]]; switching the display-off and immediately back on will result in a weak degaussing cycle or effectively no degaussing cycle.\n\nThis simple design is effective and cheap to build, but it wastes some power continuously. Later models, especially [[Energy Star]] rated ones, use a [[relay]] to switch the entire degaussing circuit on and off, so that the degaussing circuit uses energy only when it is functionally active and needed. The relay design also enables degaussing on user demand through the unit's front panel controls, without switching the unit off and on again. This relay can often be heard clicking off at the end of the degaussing cycle a few seconds after the monitor is turned on, and on and off during a manually initiated degaussing cycle.\n\nAt high refresh rates and resolutions, the deflection coil/yoke starts to produce large amounts of heat, due to the need to quickly move the electron beam (because the electron beam has to scan more lines per second), which in turn requires large amounts of power, for quickly generating strong magnetic fields. This makes CRTs beyond certain resolutions and refresh rates impractical, since the coils would need active cooling, to prevent the heat from the coils  from melting the glue that is used to attach them to the neck of the CRT.\n\n==Vector monitors==\n{{Main|Vector monitor}}\nVector monitors were used in early computer aided design systems and are in some late-1970s to mid-1980s arcade games such as ''[[Asteroids (video game)|Asteroids]]''.<ref>{{cite book |title= Supercade: A Visual History of the Videogame Age, 1971\u20131984 |author= Van Burnham |publisher= MIT Press |year= 2001 |isbn= 0-262-52420-1}}</ref>\nThey draw graphics point-to-point, rather than scanning a raster. Either monochrome or color CRTs can be used in vector displays, and the essential principles of CRT design and operation are the same for either type of display; the main difference is in the beam deflection patterns and circuits.\n\n==CRT resolution==\n[[Dot pitch]] defines the maximum resolution of the display, assuming delta-gun CRTs. In these, as the scanned resolution approaches the dot pitch resolution, [[moir\u00e9]] appears, as the detail being displayed is finer than what the shadow mask can render.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.displaymate.com/moire.html |title= Moir\u00e9 Interference Patterns |accessdate=4 October 2006 |work=DisplayMate Technologies website}}</ref> Aperture grille monitors do not suffer from vertical moir\u00e9; however, because their phosphor stripes have no vertical detail. In smaller CRTs, these strips maintain position by themselves, but larger aperture-grille CRTs require one or two crosswise (horizontal) support strips.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://computer.howstuffworks.com/question406.htm |title=What causes the faint horizontal lines on my monitor? |accessdate=4 October 2009 |work=HowStuffWorks}}</ref>\n\n==Gamma==\nCRTs have a pronounced [[triode]] characteristic, which results in significant [[gamma correction|gamma]] (a nonlinear relationship in an electron gun between applied video voltage and beam intensity).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://broadcastengineering.com/newsrooms/broadcasting_gamma_correction/ |title=Gamma correction |accessdate=4 October 2009 |last=Robin |first=Michael |date=1 January 2005 |work=BroadcastEngineering |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090531130845/http://broadcastengineering.com/newsrooms/broadcasting_gamma_correction/ |archivedate=31 May 2009}}</ref>\n\n==Other types==\n===Data storage tubes===\n{{Main|Williams tube}}\nThe Williams tube or Williams-Kilburn tube was a cathode-ray tube used to electronically store binary data. It was used in computers of the 1940s as a random-access digital storage device. In contrast to other CRTs in this article, the Williams tube was not a display device, and in fact could not be viewed since a metal plate covered its screen.\n\n===Cat's eye===\n{{Main|Magic eye tube}}\nIn some [[vacuum tube]] radio sets, a [[Magic eye tube|\"Magic Eye\" or \"Tuning Eye\" tube]] was provided to assist in tuning the receiver. Tuning would be adjusted until the width of a radial shadow was minimized. This was used instead of a more expensive electromechanical meter, which later came to be used on higher-end tuners when transistor sets lacked the high voltage required to drive the device.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.vacuumtube.com/eyetubes.htm |title=Tuning-Eye Tubes |accessdate=1 December 2009 |publisher=vacuumtube.com |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090423055711/http://www.vacuumtube.com/eyetubes.htm |archivedate=23 April 2009}}</ref> The same type of device was used with tape recorders as a recording level meter, and for various other applications including electrical test equipment.\n\n===Charactrons===\n{{Main|Charactron}}\nSome displays for early computers (those that needed to display more text than was practical using vectors, or that required high speed for photographic output) used Charactron CRTs. These incorporate a perforated metal character mask ([[stencil]]), which shapes a wide electron beam to form a character on the screen. The system selects a character on the mask using one set of deflection circuits, but that causes the extruded beam to be aimed off-axis, so a second set of deflection plates has to re-aim the beam so it is headed toward the center of the screen. A third set of plates places the character wherever required. The beam is unblanked (turned on) briefly to draw the character at that position. Graphics could be drawn by selecting the position on the mask corresponding to the code for a space (in practice, they were simply not drawn), which had a small round hole in the center; this effectively disabled the character mask, and the system reverted to regular vector behavior. Charactrons had exceptionally long necks, because of the need for three deflection systems.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.google.com/patents?vid=2735956|title=Cathode ray apparatus|accessdate=4 October 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.google.com/patents?vid=2824250|title=INPUT|accessdate=4 October 2009}}</ref>\n\n===Nimo===\n{{Main|Nimo tube}}\n[[File:Nimo tube BA0000-P31 showing digit 9.jpg|thumb|right|Nimo tube BA0000-P31]]\nNimo was the trademark of a family of small specialised CRTs manufactured by Industrial Electronics Engineers. These had 10 electron guns which produced electron beams in the form of digits in a manner similar to that of the charactron. The tubes were either simple single-digit displays or more complex 4- or 6- digit displays produced by means of a suitable magnetic deflection system. Having little of the complexities of a standard CRT, the tube required a relatively simple driving circuit, and as the image was projected on the glass face, it provided a much wider viewing angle than competitive types (e.g., [[nixie tube]]s).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tube-tester.com/sites/nixie/dat_arch/BA0000-P31.pdf |title=IEE Nimo CRT 10-gun readout tube datasheet |format=PDF |work=tube-tester.com|accessdate=1 December 2009}}</ref>\n\n===Flood beam CRT===\n{{Main|Electron-stimulated luminescence}}\nFlood beam CRTs are small tubes that are arranged as pixels for large screens like [[Jumbotron]]s. The first screen using this technology was introduced by [[Mitsubishi Electric]] for the [[1980 Major League Baseball All-Star Game]]. It differs from a normal CRT in that the electron gun within does not produce a focused controllable beam. Instead, electrons are sprayed in a wide cone across the entire front of the phosphor screen, basically making each unit act as a single light bulb.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.decadecounter.com/vta/articleview.php?item=947|title= Futaba TL-3508XA 'Jumbotron' Display|date= 11 March 2010|accessdate= 2014-12-19|website= The Vintage Technology Association: Military Industrial Electronics Research Preservation|publisher= The Vintage Technology Association}}</ref> Each one is coated with a red, green or blue phosphor, to make up the color sub-pixels.

Just a couple of years later, inexpensive \"combo\" CRT TVs ({{Convert|20|in|cm|adj=on}} screens with an integrated VHS player) disappeared from discount stores.\n\nElectronics retailers such as Best Buy steadily reduced store spaces for CRTs. In 2005, Sony announced that they would stop the production of CRT computer displays. Samsung did not introduce any CRT models for the 2008 model year at the 2008 Consumer Electronics Show; on 4 February 2008, they removed their 30\" wide screen CRTs from their North American website and did not replace them with new models.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.samsung.com/us/consumer/subtype/subtype.do?group=televisions&type=televisions&subtype=slimfithdtv |title=SlimFit HDTV|publisher=Samsung |accessdate=12 June 2008 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080110164950/http://www.samsung.com/us/consumer/subtype/subtype.do?group=televisions&type=televisions&subtype=slimfithdtv <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate= 10 January 2008}}</ref>\n\nIn the United Kingdom, [[DSG International (retailer)|DSG (Dixons)]], the largest retailer of domestic electronic equipment, reported that CRT models made up 80\u201390% of the volume of televisions sold at Christmas 2004 and 15\u201320% a year later, and that they were expected to be less than 5% at the end of 2006.

According to iSupply, production in units of CRTs was not surpassed by LCDs production until 4Q 2007, owing largely to CRT production at factories in China.{{cn|date=December 2017}}\n\n====Causes====\n{{unreferenced section|date=December 2017}}\nCRTs, despite advances, remained relatively heavy and cumbersome in comparison to other display technologies. CRT screens had much deeper cabinets compared to flat panels and rear-projection displays for a given screen size; it was largely impractical to build or use CRTs larger than {{convert|40|in|cm|0}}. The CRT disadvantages became especially significant in light of rapid technological advancements in [[liquid-crystal display|LCD]] and plasma flat-panels, which allowed them to easily surpass these size limitations while also being thin and wall-mountable (two key features that were increasingly being preferred by customers).\n\n==Health concerns==\n\n===Ionizing radiation===\nCRTs can emit a small amount of [[X-ray]] radiation as a result of the electron beam's bombardment of the shadow mask/aperture grille and phosphors. The amount of radiation escaping the front of the monitor is widely considered not to be harmful. The [[Food and Drug Administration]] regulations in {{CodeFedReg|21|1020|10}} are used to strictly limit, for instance, television receivers to 0.5 [[Roentgen (unit)|milliroentgens]] per hour (mR/h) (0.13&nbsp;\u00b5C/(kg\u00b7h) or 36&nbsp;pA/kg) at a distance of {{convert|5|cm|0|abbr=on}} from any external surface; since 2007, most CRTs have emissions that fall well below this limit.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?fr=1020.10 |title=Subchapter J, Radiological Health (21CFR1020.10) |publisher=U.S. Food and Drug Administration |date=1 April 2006 |accessdate=13 August 2007}}</ref>\n\n===Toxicity===\nOlder color and monochrome CRTs may have been manufactured with toxic substances, such as [[cadmium]], in the phosphors.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://takebackmytv.com/pages/toxic_tvs |title=Toxic TVs |accessdate=13 April 2010 |publisher=Electronics TakeBack Coalition |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227041627/http://takebackmytv.com/pages/toxic_tvs |archivedate=27 February 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://e-stewards.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/OccupationalRisksCRTGlassProcessing1.pdf |title=Occupational Risks Associated with Electronics Demanufacturing and CRT Glass Processing Operations and the Impact of Mitigation Activities on Employee Safety and Health |accessdate=20 January 2011 |author1=Peters-Michaud, Neil |author2=Katers, John |author3=Barry, Jim |format=PDF |work=Cascade Asset Management, LLC |publisher=Basel Action Network |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726012352/http://e-stewards.org/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/OccupationalRisksCRTGlassProcessing1.pdf |archivedate=26 July 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.americanelements.com/cdm.html |title=Cadmium |accessdate=13 April 2010 |publisher=[[American Elements]]}}</ref> The rear glass tube of modern CRTs may be made from [[lead glass|leaded glass]], which represent an environmental hazard if disposed of improperly.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hinkleycenter.com/publications/lead_leachability_99-5.pdf |title=Characterization of Lead Leachability from Cathode Ray Tubes Using the Toxicity Characteristic Leaching Procedure |accessdate=4 October 2009 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222012228/http://www.hinkleycenter.com/publications/lead_leachability_99-5.pdf |archivedate=22 February 2014}}</ref> By the time personal computers were produced, glass in the front panel (the viewable portion of the CRT) used barium rather than lead,{{Citation needed|date=February 2014}} though the rear of the CRT was still produced from leaded glass. Monochrome CRTs typically do not contain enough leaded glass to fail EPA TCLP tests. While the TCLP process grinds the glass into fine particles in order to expose them to weak acids to test for leachate, intact CRT glass does not leach (The lead is vitrified, contained inside the glass itself, similar to leaded glass crystalware).\n\n=== Recycling ===\nDue to the toxins contained in CRT monitors the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] created rules (in October 2001) stating that CRTs must be brought to special [[Electronic waste|e-waste recycling]] facilities. In November 2002, the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]] began fining companies that disposed of CRTs through [[landfill]]s or [[incineration]]. Regulatory agencies, local and statewide, monitor the disposal of CRTs and other computer equipment.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.epa.gov/osw/hazard/recycling/electron/index.htm|title=Final Rules on Cathode Ray Tubes and Discarded Mercury-Containing Equipment|accessdate=4 October 2009}}</ref>\n\nVarious states participate in the recycling of CRTs, each with their reporting requirements for collectors and recycling facilities. For example, in California the recycling of CRTs is governed by CALRecycle, the California Department of Resources Recycling and Recovery through their Payment System. <ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.calrecycle.ca.gov/electronics/cew|title=Covered Electronic Waste Payment System|first=State of|last=California|website=www.calrecycle.ca.gov}}</ref>. Recycling facilities that accept CRT devices from business and residential sector must obtain contact information such as address and phone number to ensure the CRTs come from a California source in order to participate in the CRT Recycling Payment System. \n\nIn Europe, disposal of CRT televisions and monitors is covered by the [[WEEE Directive]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.awm-group.com/recycling/WEEEandCRTProcessing.htm |title=WEEE and CRT Processing |accessdate=4 October 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090603065621/http://www.awm-group.com/recycling/WEEEandCRTProcessing.htm |archive-date=3 June 2009 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n===Flicker===\n{{Main|Flicker (screen)}}\nAt low [[refresh rate]]s (60&nbsp;[[Hertz|Hz]] and below), the periodic scanning of the display may produce a flicker that some people perceive more easily than others, especially when viewed with [[peripheral vision]]. Flicker is commonly associated with CRT as most televisions run at 50&nbsp;Hz (PAL) or 60&nbsp;Hz (NTSC), although there are some 100&nbsp;Hz PAL televisions that are [[flicker-free]]. Typically only low-end monitors run at such low frequencies, with most computer monitors supporting at least 75&nbsp;Hz and high-end monitors capable of 100&nbsp;Hz or more to eliminate any perception of flicker.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pcmech.com/article/crt-monitor-flickering/|archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160515111055/http://www.pcmech.com/article/crt-monitor-flickering/|url-status=dead|archive-date=15 May 2016|title=CRT Monitor Flickering?|accessdate=4 October 2009|df=dmy-all}}</ref> Though the 100 Hz PAL was often achieved using interleaved scanning, dividing the circuit and scan into two beams of 50 Hz. Non-computer CRTs or CRT for [[sonar]] or [[radar]] may have long [[Image persistence|persistence]] phosphor and are thus flicker free. If the persistence is too long on a video display, moving images will be blurred.\n\n===High-frequency audible noise===\n50&nbsp;Hz/60&nbsp;Hz CRTs used for television operate with horizontal scanning frequencies of 15,734&nbsp;Hz (for [[NTSC]] systems) or 15,625&nbsp;Hz (for [[PAL]] systems).<ref>{{cite book |last= Netravali |first= Arun N. |author2=Haskell, Barry G. |title= Digital pictures: representation, compression, and standards |publisher= Plenum Publishing Corporation |year= 1995 |page= 100 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=-TXYfZrCBuQC&pg=PA100 |isbn=978-0-306-44917-8}}</ref> These frequencies are at the upper range of [[human hearing]] and are inaudible to many people; however, some people (especially children) will perceive a high-pitched tone near an operating television CRT.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pcguide.com/ts/x/comp/crt/failWhine-c.html |title=The monitor is producing a high-pitched whine |accessdate=4 October 2009}}</ref> The sound is due to [[magnetostriction]] in the magnetic core and periodic movement of windings of the [[flyback transformer]].<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Rhys-Jones |first1=J. |title=Television economics |journal=Radiotronics |date=February 1951 |volume=16 |issue=2 |page=37}}</ref>\n\nThis problem does not occur on 100/120&nbsp;Hz TVs and on non-CGA (Color Graphics Adapter) computer displays, because they use much higher horizontal scanning frequencies (22&nbsp;kHz to over 100&nbsp;kHz).\n\n===Implosion===\nHigh [[vacuum]] inside glass-walled cathode-ray tubes permits electron beams to fly freely\u2014without colliding into molecules of air or other gas. If the glass is damaged, atmospheric pressure can collapse the vacuum tube into dangerous fragments which accelerate inward and then spray at high speed in all directions. The implosion energy is proportional to the evacuated volume of the CRT.{{cn|date=December 2017}} Although modern cathode-ray tubes used in televisions and computer displays have [[epoxy]]-bonded face-plates or other measures to prevent shattering of the envelope, CRTs must be handled carefully to avoid personal injury.<ref name=Bali>{{cite book |last= Bali |first= S.P. |title= Colour Television: Theory and Practice |publisher= Tata McGraw\u2013Hill |year= 1994 |page= 129 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=53nnX4fnnNIC&pg=PA129 |isbn=978-0-07-460024-5}}</ref>\n\n===Electric shock===\nTo accelerate the electrons from the cathode to the screen with sufficient velocity, a very [[high voltage]] (EHT or Extra High Tension) is required,<ref>Color Television Servicing Manual, Vol-1, by M.D. Aggarwala, 1985, Television for you, Delhi, India</ref> from a few thousand volts for a small oscilloscope CRT to tens of kV for a larger screen color TV. This is many times greater than household power supply voltage. Even after the power supply is turned off, some associated capacitors and the CRT itself may retain  a charge for some time and therefore dissipate that charge suddenly through a ground such as an inattentive human grounding a capacitor  discharge lead.\n\n==Security concerns==\nUnder some circumstances, the signal radiated from the [[electron gun]]s, scanning circuitry, and associated wiring of a CRT can be captured remotely and used to reconstruct what is shown on the CRT using a process called [[Van Eck phreaking]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://jya.com/emr.pdf|title=Electromagnetic Radiation from Video Display Units: An Eavesdropping Risk?|accessdate=4 October 2009}}</ref> Special [[TEMPEST]] shielding can mitigate this effect.

It was based on a libretto by  [[Angelo Anelli]] for [[Stefano Pavesi]]'s opera ''[[Ser Marcantonio]]'' written in 1810<ref>Ashbrook & Hibberd 2001, p. 244</ref> but, on the published libretto, the author appears as \"M.A.\"\n\nDonizetti so dominated the preparation of the libretto that Ruffini refused to allow his name to be put on the score. This resulted in confusion over the identity of the librettist for more than half a century,<ref>Ashbrook 1982, p. 174</ref> but as [[Herbert Weinstock]] establishes, it was largely Ruffini's work and, in withholding his name from it as librettist, \"Donizetti or [his assistant] Accursi may have thought that, lacking Ruffini's name, the authorship might as well be assigned to Accursi's initials as to a pseudonym\".<ref>Weinstock 1963, p. 363</ref>\n\nThe opera was first performed on 3 January 1843 by the [[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre-Italien]] at the [[Salle Ventadour]] in Paris with great success<ref>Donizetti 1870; Chouquet 1889, p. 238. (Chouquet mistakenly gives 4 January as the date of the premiere)</ref> and it is generally regarded as being the high point of the 19th century ''opera buffa'' tradition and, in fact, marking its ending.\n\n==Composition history==\n{{multiple image\n | align=left\n | width1 = 200\n | image1 = Engraved portrait of opera singer Giulia Grisi, dressed to perform \"Norma\" (1844).jpg\n | caption1 = Giulia Grisi, 1844\n | width2= 172\n | image2 = Antonio Tamburini II Litho.jpg\n | caption2 = Antonio Tamburini\n }}\nDonizetti had just returned to Paris from Vienna in the autumn of 1842 and it was there that it was suggested to him by [[Jules Janin]], the newly appointed director of the ''Th\u00e9\u00e2tre-Italien'', that he might compose a new opera for that house.<ref name=WEIN88-90>Weinstock 1963, pp. 188\u2013190</ref>  Janin prepared a formal proposal on 27 September, but while no specific subject nor title was mentioned, Janin suggested that it should be a new ''opera buffa'' tailored to the talents of some major singers including [[Giulia Grisi]], [[Antonio Tamburini]], and [[Luigi Lablache]].<ref name=WEIN88-90/>\n\n{{anchor|Accursi}} At around the same time in September, the Italian \u00e9migr\u00e9 librettist [[Giovanni Ruffini]], who lived in Paris, was approached by Michele Accursi (who is described as \"Donizetti's Paris factotum, [an] Italian exile, and politically treacherous double agent\" <ref name=WEIN88>Weinstock 1963, p. 188</ref>) with the suggestion that Ruffini offer his services to Donizetti as a librettist. This is confirmed by a letter from Ruffini to his mother of around 5 October in which the librettist tells her of Accursi's suggestion that the composer would use a story which was written in 1810 and that he would need \"a working stonemason of verses to remake the old libretto, to cut, change, add, plaster, and I don't know what.\"<ref name=WEIN88-89>Ruffini to his mother, 5 October; 11 October; and date unknown, in Weinstock 1963, pp. 188\u2013189</ref>  In addition, it is clear from another letter on 11 October to his mother that Ruffini is hard at work: \"I've been eating up the paper, as they say.  It's not a question of doing it well or doing it badly, but of doing it fast.\"<ref name=WEIN88-89/>  By the end, Ruffini stated that so much of the refinement of the work had been done by Donizetti that he felt that \"my freedom of action having been paralyzed by the maestro, I don't, so to say, recognize it as mine\".<ref name=WEIN88-89/>  Therefore, he refused to have his name associated with the libretto, which was eventually published by [[Casa Ricordi]] as by \"M.A.\", since it was Accursi who officially ceded the rights to Ricordi so long as his name was never associated with the work.<ref>Weinstock 1963, p. 189\u2013190</ref>\n\nIn the tradition of opera buffa, the opera makes reference to the stock characters of the ''[[commedia dell'arte]]''. Pasquale is recognizable as the blustery [[Pantalone]], Ernesto as the lovesick [[Pierrot]], Malatesta as the scheming [[Scapino]], and Norina as a wily [[Columbina]]. The false ''Notary'' echoes a long line of false officials as operatic devices.\n\nWith rehearsals in progress in December 1842, it appeared that there was general pessimism as to its success: \"the atmosphere during rehearsals was frigid\" states Weinstock and records the lack of interest from the management and the orchestra musicians. \"The work had been condemned, judged\", he concludes.<ref name=WEIN194>Weinstock 1963, p. 194</ref>  However, during the evening of the final dress rehearsal, Donizetti added a new piece which he had already written for the tenor, ''Com'\u00e8 gentil'', which was designed for the third act.

After a while, the ambience changes to suggesting a party, and the overture ends with a finale.\n\n===Act 1===\n''Scenes 1\u20133: A room in the home of Don Pasquale, at 9 o'clock''\n\nErnesto has refused the woman that his uncle Don Pasquale had found for him, and as a result is to be disinherited.  Ernesto declares his devotion to the young \u2013 but poor \u2013 widow Norina. In view of Ernesto's determination, Don Pasquale decides to marry in old age to produce his own heir, and anxiously awaits the arrival of his physician, Dr. Malatesta, who is determined to teach Don Pasquale how foolish he is being, but has been pretending to search for a suitable bride.  Malatesta, confronted with Pasquale's impatience, mutters that he is a buffoon, but proceeds to describe the attributes of the bride-to-be (''Bella siccome un angelo'' \u2013 \"Beautiful like an angel\").  Honest, modest and sweet \u2013 when pressed, Malatesta reveals she is in fact his sister.  Overcome with joy, Pasquale demands to meet her at once, and sends Malatesta to fetch her, before singing of the love that has gripped him (''Ah, un foco insolito'' \u2013 \"A sudden fire\").\n\nErnesto comes back and pleads with the Don to consult with his friend Malatesta \u2013 when he hears that Malatesta supposedly supports Pasquale, he is amazed at this apparent betrayal (''Mi fa il destino mendico'' \u2013 \"Fate has made a beggar of me\").  Ernesto determines to elope and writes to tell Norina that all is lost.\n\n''Scenes 4\u20135: An apartment in the home of Norina''\n\nNorina sits alone, reading a book.  She recites a passage, before laughing at the situation described and reflecting on her own temperament (''So anch'io la virt\u00f9 magica'' \u2013 \"I too know your magical virtues\").  She is in cahoots with Dr. Malatesta and impatiently waits for him to come and explain his plan at which he had only hinted.  A servant delivers the letter from Ernesto, which she quickly reads and is instantly dismayed.\n\nMalatesta arrives to explain the stratagem, but Norina cuts him off and hands him the letter, which he reads aloud: Ernesto has announced his intention to leave Rome, and Europe altogether.  Malatesta reassures her, saying that he has adapted his plan: Norina shall play the part of Malatesta's sister.  Having arranged for his cousin to act as a notary, they will easily deceive the Don.  Norina consents to play her part in the deception, and they discuss her strategies in a lively duet (''Pronta son; purch'io non manchi'' \u2013 \"I am ready; if I do not miss\").\n\n===Act 2===\n[[File:Son tradito, calpestato (Don Pasquale).webm|thumb|Act II finale, \"Son tradito\", at the [[Liceu]] in 2015.  Cast: \nLorenzo Regazzo (Don Pasquale), Valentina Nafornita (Norina), Juan Francisco Gatell (Ernesto), [[Mariusz Kwiecien]] (Dottor Malatesta)]]\n''A salon in the home of Don Pasquale''\n\nErnesto is alone: lamenting his fate, he considers his decision to leave Rome (''Cercher\u00f2 lontana terra'' \u2013 \"I shall seek a distant land\").  He leaves the room just as Pasquale enters, dressed in his outdated finery, along with his servants, to whom he gives instructions to admit Malatesta on his arrival.  He parades around in his grand costume, hoping it will conceal his advancing years.\n\nMalatesta arrives with Norina in tow, and introduces her to Pasquale as his sister, Sofronia, fresh out of the convent.  Pasquale is smitten, and Norina plays the part of a dutiful, modest and submissive lady, to Pasquale's satisfaction.  Norina consents to the proposed marriage, which delights Pasquale.  He wants to send for the notary to conduct the ceremony straight away \u2013 conveniently, Malatesta has brought one along, who waits in the antechamber.\n\nMalatesta fetches the supposed notary, as servants arrange a table.  Taking his seat, the \"notary\" writes out a marriage contract as dictated by Malatesta and Pasquale (''Fra da una parta'' \u2013 \"Between, on one hand\"), where the Don bequeaths all his estate to be administrated by Sofronia.  The contract is quickly drawn up: Pasquale signs but, before Norina can affix her signature, Ernesto bursts in.  Intending to say a final farewell, he is amazed to see Norina about to marry Pasquale.  However, Malatesta persuades him not to say anything (''Figliol non mi far scene'' \u2013 \"Son, don't make a scene\"), and he is forced to act as the final witness much to Don Pasquale's delight.\n\nAs soon as the contract is signed, Norina abandons her pretence of docility, and refuses Pasquale's embrace.  She announces her intention to teach ''him'' manners, and to have Ernesto as a gallant to accompany her on evening strolls.  Pasquale is horrified at this transformation, while Malatesta and Ernesto can barely conceal their amusement (''\u00c8 rimasto l\u00e0 impietrato'' \u2013 \"He stands there, petrified\").  Summoning the household staff, Norina recites a long list of demands \u2013 more servants (young and handsome at that), carriages and horses, furniture \u2013 and instructs them to spare no expense doubling all their wages.  Pasquale is stricken at his misfortune, so Malatesta urges him to go to bed.\n\n===Act 3===\n[[File:Engraving premiere Don Pasquale at Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Italien 1843 - La Fenice 2002 programma di sala p88.jpg|thumb|Staging of ''Don Pasquale'' at the [[Salle Ventadour]] in Paris (1843)]]\n''Scenes 1\u20135: A room in the home of Don Pasquale''\n\nPasquale sits in a room, surrounded by piles of newly purchased jewels, dresses and the like, as the servants bustle in and out of Norina's apartment (''I diamanti presto presto'' \u2013 \"The diamonds, quickly, quickly\").  Dismayed by the piles of bills and invoices, the Don summons the courage to confront his tyrannical new wife.  Norina emerges, dressed to go out.  He attempts to reason with her, but she pays little heed (''Signorina, in tanta fretta'' \u2013 \"Madam, where are you off to in such a hurry\").  He suggests that if she leaves, he may not allow her to return, an idea that she meets with patronising insincerity (''Via, caro sposino'' \u2013 \"There, there, dear little husband\") but the discussion ends in her slapping him.  As she exits, she drops a note which Pasquale picks up and reads.  The note is addressed to Sofronia, arranging a meeting in the garden with its unnamed, admiring author.  Pasquale calls for a servant to summon Malatesta, before leaving the room.\n\nThe servants return and, amongst themselves, at once complain at the amount of work they are being made to do, and reveal how much they are enjoying the farcical drama developing between Pasquale and his new wife (''Che interminabile andirivieni!'' \u2013 \"Such endless coming and going!\").  At the approach of Malatesta and Ernesto, however, they exit, assured of more entertainment to come.  Malatesta reminds Ernesto of the finer points of their plan, and the latter leaves.  The doctor moves forward to greet Don Pasquale, who tells him of Norina's intended assignation, and his own plan to expose her unfaithfulness before a magistrate.  Malatesta persuades him to moderate his plan and Pasquale, believing him an ally, consents to his conditions, while plotting his revenge on Norina (''Aspetta, aspetta, cara sposina'' \u2013 \"Wait, wait, dear little wife\").\n\n''Scenes 6\u20137: The garden, adjoining Pasquale's house''\n\nIn the garden, as night draws in, Ernesto sings of his love for Norina, as he waits for her arrival (''Com'\u00e8 gentil'' \u2013 \"How lovely\").  At last, Norina emerges, and they express their love: (''Tornami a dir che m'ami'' \u2013 \"Tell me once more that you love me\").  Don Pasquale and Malatesta have observed and, as they reveal themselves, Ernesto covers himself with a cloak and runs to the house.  Pasquale tries to confront Norina \u2013 he has caught her ''in flagrante'' \u2013 but this only provokes a fight that leaves the Don spluttering.  She refuses to leave at his demand, so Malatesta, as per his agreement with Pasquale, takes over.  Pretending to negotiate with Norina/Sofronia, he tells Pasquale that the only way to make her leave will be to allow Ernesto to marry his beloved, whom \"Sofronia\" apparently despises.  Pasquale consents, and calls out to the house, from which Ernesto and the servants emerge.  He instructs Ernesto to send for his would-be bride, but Malatesta reveals that Norina is in fact the woman Pasquale thinks he married, while the real Sofronia remains in a convent.  All are reconciled, and the moral of the story \u2013 not to marry in old age \u2013 is revealed in a playful quartet (''La moral di tutto questo'' \u2013 \"The moral of all this\").\n\n==Recordings==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Year\n!Cast<br/>(Don Pasquale,<br>Norina,<br>Malatesta,<br>Ernesto)\n!Conductor,<br/>Opera house and orchestra\n!Label<ref>[http://www.operadis-opera-discography.org.uk/CLDODONP.HTM Source of recording on operadis-opera-discography.org.uk]</ref>\n|-\n|1930\u201331\n|Attilio Giuliani,<br />Ines Alfani-Tellini,<br />Lorenzo Conati,<br />Christy Solari\n|[[Lorenzo Molajoli]]<br />[[Teatro alla Scala]], Milan Orchestra and Chorus\n|78rpm records: Columbia<br />Cat: GQX 10100-10105\n|-\n|1932\n|[[Ernesto Badini]],<br />Adelaide Saraceni,<br />[[Afro Poli]],<br />[[Tito Schipa]]\n|[[Carlo Sabajno]]<br />La Scala Orchestra and Chorus\n|CD: Arkadia<br />Cat: 2CD 78017\n|-\n|1952\n|[[Sesto Bruscantini]],<br>[[Alda Noni]],<br>Mario Borriello,<br>[[Cesare Valletti]]\n|[[Mario Rossi]],<br>Orchestra e Coro Sinfonica di Torino della RAI\n|CD: Warner Fonit Cetra<br>Cat: 8573 87476-2\n|-\n|1964\n|[[Fernando Corena]],<br />[[Graziella Sciutti]],<br />[[Tom Krause]],<br />[[Juan Oncina]]\n|[[Istv\u00e1n Kert\u00e9sz (conductor)|Istv\u00e1n Kert\u00e9sz]]<br />Vienna State Opera Orchestra and Chorus\n|CD: Decca \"Originals\"<br />Cat: 897402<ref name=greenfield>[[Edward Greenfield|Greenfield, Edward]], March, Ivan, Czajkowski, Paul, and Layton, Robert (2011).

It was based on a libretto by  [[Angelo Anelli]] for [[Stefano Pavesi]]'s opera ''[[Ser Marcantonio]]'' written in 1810<ref>Ashbrook & Hibberd 2001, p. 244</ref> but, on the published libretto, the author appears as \"M.A.\"\n\nDonizetti so dominated the preparation of the libretto that Ruffini refused to allow his name to be put on the score. This resulted in confusion over the identity of the librettist for more than half a century,<ref>Ashbrook 1982, p. 174</ref> but as [[Herbert Weinstock]] establishes, it was largely Ruffini's work and, in withholding his name from it as librettist, \"Donizetti or [his assistant] Accursi may have thought that, lacking Ruffini's name, the authorship might as well be assigned to Accursi's initials as to a pseudonym\".<ref>Weinstock 1963, p. 363</ref>\n\nThe opera was first performed on 3 January 1843 by the [[Th\u00e9\u00e2tre-Italien]] at the [[Salle Ventadour]] in Paris with great success<ref>Donizetti 1870; Chouquet 1889, p. 238. (Chouquet mistakenly gives 4 January as the date of the premiere)</ref> and it is generally regarded as being the high point of the 19th century ''opera buffa'' tradition and, in fact, marking its ending.\n\n==Composition history==\n{{multiple image\n | align=left\n | width1 = 200\n | image1 = Engraved portrait of opera singer Giulia Grisi, dressed to perform \"Norma\" (1844).jpg\n | caption1 = Giulia Grisi, 1844\n | width2= 172\n | image2 = Antonio Tamburini II Litho.jpg\n | caption2 = Antonio Tamburini\n }}\nDonizetti had just returned to Paris from Vienna in the autumn of 1842 and it was there that it was suggested to him by [[Jules Janin]], the newly appointed director of the ''Th\u00e9\u00e2tre-Italien'', that he might compose a new opera for that house.<ref name=WEIN88-90>Weinstock 1963, pp. 188\u2013190</ref>  Janin prepared a formal proposal on 27 September, but while no specific subject nor title was mentioned, Janin suggested that it should be a new ''opera buffa'' tailored to the talents of some major singers including [[Giulia Grisi]], [[Antonio Tamburini]], and [[Luigi Lablache]].<ref name=WEIN88-90/>\n\n{{anchor|Accursi}} At around the same time in September, the Italian \u00e9migr\u00e9 librettist [[Giovanni Ruffini]], who lived in Paris, was approached by Michele Accursi (who is described as \"Donizetti's Paris factotum, [an] Italian exile, and politically treacherous double agent\" <ref name=WEIN88>Weinstock 1963, p. 188</ref>) with the suggestion that Ruffini offer his services to Donizetti as a librettist. This is confirmed by a letter from Ruffini to his mother of around 5 October in which the librettist tells her of Accursi's suggestion that the composer would use a story which was written in 1810 and that he would need \"a working stonemason of verses to remake the old libretto, to cut, change, add, plaster, and I don't know what.\"<ref name=WEIN88-89>Ruffini to his mother, 5 October; 11 October; and date unknown, in Weinstock 1963, pp. 188\u2013189</ref>  In addition, it is clear from another letter on 11 October to his mother that Ruffini is hard at work: \"I've been eating up the paper, as they say.  It's not a question of doing it well or doing it badly, but of doing it fast.\"<ref name=WEIN88-89/>  By the end, Ruffini stated that so much of the refinement of the work had been done by Donizetti that he felt that \"my freedom of action having been paralyzed by the maestro, I don't, so to say, recognize it as mine\".<ref name=WEIN88-89/>  Therefore, he refused to have his name associated with the libretto, which was eventually published by [[Casa Ricordi]] as by \"M.A.\", since it was Accursi who officially ceded the rights to Ricordi so long as his name was never associated with the work.<ref>Weinstock 1963, p. 189\u2013190</ref>\n\nIn the tradition of opera buffa, the opera makes reference to the stock characters of the ''[[commedia dell'arte]]''. Pasquale is recognizable as the blustery [[Pantalone]], Ernesto as the lovesick [[Pierrot]], Malatesta as the scheming [[Scapino]], and Norina as a wily [[Columbina]]. The false ''Notary'' echoes a long line of false officials as operatic devices.\n\nWith rehearsals in progress in December 1842, it appeared that there was general pessimism as to its success: \"the atmosphere during rehearsals was frigid\" states Weinstock and records the lack of interest from the management and the orchestra musicians. \"The work had been condemned, judged\", he concludes.<ref name=WEIN194>Weinstock 1963, p. 194</ref>  However, during the evening of the final dress rehearsal, Donizetti added a new piece which he had already written for the tenor, ''Com'\u00e8 gentil'', which was designed for the third act. As for fears for the opera's success, the composer had none: \"Have no fear for me...My work will be a success\", he stated.<ref>Donizetti to Escudier, in Weinstock 1963, p. 194</ref>\n\n== Performance history ==\nAt its premiere ''Don Pasquale'' was performed by four of the most celebrated singers of the day<ref>Harewood & Peattie 1997, p. 211; Ashbrook 1992, p. 1224.</ref> and was an immediate success.<ref>Weinstock 1963, p. 194; Ashbrook 1982, p. 175.</ref><ref>Reviews of the premiere: ''[[Revue et gazette musicale de Paris]]'' [https://archive.org/stream/revueetgazettemu1843pari#page/11/mode/1up vol 10, no. 2 (8 january 1843)] (in French); ''[[Le M\u00e9nestrel]]'', [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k5621446p/f1.image vol. 10, no. 6 (8 January 1843)] (in French).</ref> It was recognized at the time as Donizetti's comic masterpiece<ref>Budden 1992, p. 1211; Harewood & Peattie 1997, p. 211; Ashbrook & Hibberd 2001, p. 244\u2013245.</ref> and, to this day, is still considered as such.

After a while, the ambience changes to suggesting a party, and the overture ends with a finale.\n\n===Act 1===\n''Scenes 1\u20133: A room in the home of Don Pasquale, at 9 o'clock''\n\nErnesto has refused the woman that his uncle Don Pasquale had found for him, and as a result is to be disinherited.  Ernesto declares his devotion to the young \u2013 but poor \u2013 widow Norina. In view of Ernesto's determination, Don Pasquale decides to marry in old age to produce his own heir, and anxiously awaits the arrival of his physician, Dr. Malatesta, who is determined to teach Don Pasquale how foolish he is being, but has been pretending to search for a suitable bride.  Malatesta, confronted with Pasquale's impatience, mutters that he is a buffoon, but proceeds to describe the attributes of the bride-to-be (''Bella siccome un angelo'' \u2013 \"Beautiful like an angel\").  Honest, modest and sweet \u2013 when pressed, Malatesta reveals she is in fact his sister.  Overcome with joy, Pasquale demands to meet her at once, and sends Malatesta to fetch her, before singing of the love that has gripped him (''Ah, un foco insolito'' \u2013 \"A sudden fire\").\n\nErnesto comes back and pleads with the Don to consult with his friend Malatesta \u2013 when he hears that Malatesta supposedly supports Pasquale, he is amazed at this apparent betrayal (''Mi fa il destino mendico'' \u2013 \"Fate has made a beggar of me\").  Ernesto determines to elope and writes to tell Norina that all is lost.\n\n''Scenes 4\u20135: An apartment in the home of Norina''\n\nNorina sits alone, reading a book.  She recites a passage, before laughing at the situation described and reflecting on her own temperament (''So anch'io la virt\u00f9 magica'' \u2013 \"I too know your magical virtues\").  She is in cahoots with Dr. Malatesta and impatiently waits for him to come and explain his plan at which he had only hinted.  A servant delivers the letter from Ernesto, which she quickly reads and is instantly dismayed.\n\nMalatesta arrives to explain the stratagem, but Norina cuts him off and hands him the letter, which he reads aloud: Ernesto has announced his intention to leave Rome, and Europe altogether.  Malatesta reassures her, saying that he has adapted his plan: Norina shall play the part of Malatesta's sister.  Having arranged for his cousin to act as a notary, they will easily deceive the Don.  Norina consents to play her part in the deception, and they discuss her strategies in a lively duet (''Pronta son; purch'io non manchi'' \u2013 \"I am ready; if I do not miss\").\n\n===Act 2===\n[[File:Son tradito, calpestato (Don Pasquale).webm|thumb|Act II finale, \"Son tradito\", at the [[Liceu]] in 2015.  Cast: \nLorenzo Regazzo (Don Pasquale), Valentina Nafornita (Norina), Juan Francisco Gatell (Ernesto), [[Mariusz Kwiecien]] (Dottor Malatesta)]]\n''A salon in the home of Don Pasquale''\n\nErnesto is alone: lamenting his fate, he considers his decision to leave Rome (''Cercher\u00f2 lontana terra'' \u2013 \"I shall seek a distant land\").  He leaves the room just as Pasquale enters, dressed in his outdated finery, along with his servants, to whom he gives instructions to admit Malatesta on his arrival.  He parades around in his grand costume, hoping it will conceal his advancing years.\n\nMalatesta arrives with Norina in tow, and introduces her to Pasquale as his sister, Sofronia, fresh out of the convent.  Pasquale is smitten, and Norina plays the part of a dutiful, modest and submissive lady, to Pasquale's satisfaction.  Norina consents to the proposed marriage, which delights Pasquale.  He wants to send for the notary to conduct the ceremony straight away \u2013 conveniently, Malatesta has brought one along, who waits in the antechamber.\n\nMalatesta fetches the supposed notary, as servants arrange a table.  Taking his seat, the \"notary\" writes out a marriage contract as dictated by Malatesta and Pasquale (''Fra da una parta'' \u2013 \"Between, on one hand\"), where the Don bequeaths all his estate to be administrated by Sofronia.  The contract is quickly drawn up: Pasquale signs but, before Norina can affix her signature, Ernesto bursts in.  Intending to say a final farewell, he is amazed to see Norina about to marry Pasquale.  However, Malatesta persuades him not to say anything (''Figliol non mi far scene'' \u2013 \"Son, don't make a scene\"), and he is forced to act as the final witness much to Don Pasquale's delight.\n\nAs soon as the contract is signed, Norina abandons her pretence of docility, and refuses Pasquale's embrace.  She announces her intention to teach ''him'' manners, and to have Ernesto as a gallant to accompany her on evening strolls.  Pasquale is horrified at this transformation, while Malatesta and Ernesto can barely conceal their amusement (''\u00c8 rimasto l\u00e0 impietrato'' \u2013 \"He stands there, petrified\").  Summoning the household staff, Norina recites a long list of demands \u2013 more servants (young and handsome at that), carriages and horses, furniture \u2013 and instructs them to spare no expense doubling all their wages.  Pasquale is stricken at his misfortune, so Malatesta urges him to go to bed.\n\n===Act 3===\n[[File:Engraving premiere Don Pasquale at Th\u00e9\u00e2tre Italien 1843 - La Fenice 2002 programma di sala p88.jpg|thumb|Staging of ''Don Pasquale'' at the [[Salle Ventadour]] in Paris (1843)]]\n''Scenes 1\u20135: A room in the home of Don Pasquale''\n\nPasquale sits in a room, surrounded by piles of newly purchased jewels, dresses and the like, as the servants bustle in and out of Norina's apartment (''I diamanti presto presto'' \u2013 \"The diamonds, quickly, quickly\").  Dismayed by the piles of bills and invoices, the Don summons the courage to confront his tyrannical new wife.  Norina emerges, dressed to go out.  He attempts to reason with her, but she pays little heed (''Signorina, in tanta fretta'' \u2013 \"Madam, where are you off to in such a hurry\").  He suggests that if she leaves, he may not allow her to return, an idea that she meets with patronising insincerity (''Via, caro sposino'' \u2013 \"There, there, dear little husband\") but the discussion ends in her slapping him.  As she exits, she drops a note which Pasquale picks up and reads.  The note is addressed to Sofronia, arranging a meeting in the garden with its unnamed, admiring author.  Pasquale calls for a servant to summon Malatesta, before leaving the room.\n\nThe servants return and, amongst themselves, at once complain at the amount of work they are being made to do, and reveal how much they are enjoying the farcical drama developing between Pasquale and his new wife (''Che interminabile andirivieni!'' \u2013 \"Such endless coming and going!\").  At the approach of Malatesta and Ernesto, however, they exit, assured of more entertainment to come.  Malatesta reminds Ernesto of the finer points of their plan, and the latter leaves.  The doctor moves forward to greet Don Pasquale, who tells him of Norina's intended assignation, and his own plan to expose her unfaithfulness before a magistrate.  Malatesta persuades him to moderate his plan and Pasquale, believing him an ally, consents to his conditions, while plotting his revenge on Norina (''Aspetta, aspetta, cara sposina'' \u2013 \"Wait, wait, dear little wife\").\n\n''Scenes 6\u20137: The garden, adjoining Pasquale's house''\n\nIn the garden, as night draws in, Ernesto sings of his love for Norina, as he waits for her arrival (''Com'\u00e8 gentil'' \u2013 \"How lovely\").  At last, Norina emerges, and they express their love: (''Tornami a dir che m'ami'' \u2013 \"Tell me once more that you love me\").  Don Pasquale and Malatesta have observed and, as they reveal themselves, Ernesto covers himself with a cloak and runs to the house.  Pasquale tries to confront Norina \u2013 he has caught her ''in flagrante'' \u2013 but this only provokes a fight that leaves the Don spluttering.  She refuses to leave at his demand, so Malatesta, as per his agreement with Pasquale, takes over.  Pretending to negotiate with Norina/Sofronia, he tells Pasquale that the only way to make her leave will be to allow Ernesto to marry his beloved, whom \"Sofronia\" apparently despises.  Pasquale consents, and calls out to the house, from which Ernesto and the servants emerge.  He instructs Ernesto to send for his would-be bride, but Malatesta reveals that Norina is in fact the woman Pasquale thinks he married, while the real Sofronia remains in a convent.  All are reconciled, and the moral of the story \u2013 not to marry in old age \u2013 is revealed in a playful quartet (''La moral di tutto questo'' \u2013 \"The moral of all this\").\n\n==Recordings==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!Year\n!Cast<br/>(Don Pasquale,<br>Norina,<br>Malatesta,<br>Ernesto)\n!Conductor,<br/>Opera house and orchestra\n!Label<ref>[http://www.operadis-opera-discography.org.uk/CLDODONP.HTM Source of recording on operadis-opera-discography.org.uk]</ref>\n|-\n|1930\u201331\n|Attilio Giuliani,<br />Ines Alfani-Tellini,<br />Lorenzo Conati,<br />Christy Solari\n|[[Lorenzo Molajoli]]<br />[[Teatro alla Scala]], Milan Orchestra and Chorus\n|78rpm records: Columbia<br />Cat: GQX 10100-10105\n|-\n|1932\n|[[Ernesto Badini]],<br />Adelaide Saraceni,<br />[[Afro Poli]],<br />[[Tito Schipa]]\n|[[Carlo Sabajno]]<br />La Scala Orchestra and Chorus\n|CD: Arkadia<br />Cat: 2CD 78017\n|-\n|1952\n|[[Sesto Bruscantini]],<br>[[Alda Noni]],<br>Mario Borriello,<br>[[Cesare Valletti]]\n|[[Mario Rossi]],<br>Orchestra e Coro Sinfonica di Torino della RAI\n|CD: Warner Fonit Cetra<br>Cat: 8573 87476-2\n|-\n|1964\n|[[Fernando Corena]],<br />[[Graziella Sciutti]],<br />[[Tom Krause]],<br />[[Juan Oncina]]\n|[[Istv\u00e1n Kert\u00e9sz (conductor)|Istv\u00e1n Kert\u00e9sz]]<br />Vienna State Opera Orchestra and Chorus\n|CD: Decca \"Originals\"<br />Cat: 897402<ref name=greenfield>[[Edward Greenfield|Greenfield, Edward]], March, Ivan, Czajkowski, Paul, and Layton, Robert (2011).

He is one of the most notable representatives of the [[Early Netherlandish painting]] school. His work contains fantastic illustrations of religious concepts and narratives.<ref>Catherine B. Scallen, ''The Art of the Northern Renaissance'' (Chantilly: The Teaching Company, 2007) Lecture 26</ref> Within his lifetime his work was collected in the Netherlands, Austria, and Spain, and widely copied, especially his macabre and nightmarish depictions of [[hell]].\n\nLittle is known of Bosch's life, though there are some records.  He spent most of it in the town of [['s-Hertogenbosch]], where he was born in his grandfather's house. The roots of his forefathers are in [[Nijmegen]] and [[Aachen]] (which is visible in his surname: Van Aken). His pessimistic and fantastical style cast a wide influence on northern art of the 16th century, with [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]] being his best-known follower. Today he is seen as a hugely individualistic painter with deep insight into humanity's desires and deepest fears. Attribution has been especially difficult; today only about 25 paintings are confidently given to his hand<ref name=Siegal1Feb/> along with eight drawings. About another half dozen paintings are confidently attributed to his workshop. His most acclaimed works consist of a few [[triptych]] altarpieces, including ''[[The Garden of Earthly Delights]]''.\n\n==Life==\nHieronymus Bosch was born Jheronimus (or Joen,<ref>Dijck (2000): pp. 43\u201344.

He left behind no letters or diaries, and what has been identified has been taken from brief references to him in the municipal records of {{nowrap|'s-Hertogenbosch}}, and in the account books of the local order of the [[Illustrious Brotherhood of Our Blessed Lady]]. Nothing is known of his personality or his thoughts on the meaning of his art. Bosch's date of birth has not been determined with certainty. It is estimated at {{nowrap|{{circa}} 1450}} on the basis of a hand drawn portrait (which may be a self-portrait) made shortly before his death in 1516. The drawing shows the artist at an advanced age, probably in his late sixties.<ref>Gibson, 15\u201316</ref>\n\nBosch was born and lived all his life in and near {{nowrap|[['s-Hertogenbosch]]}}, a city in the [[Duchy of Brabant]]. His grandfather Jan van Aken (died 1454) was a painter and is first mentioned in the records in 1430. It is known that Jan had five sons, four of whom were also painters. Bosch's father, Anthonius van Aken (died {{circa}} 1478), acted as artistic adviser to the [[Illustrious Brotherhood of Our Blessed Lady]].<ref>Gibson, 15, 17</ref> It is generally assumed that either Bosch's father or one of his uncles taught the artist to paint, but none of their works survive.<ref>Gibson, 19</ref> Bosch first appears in the municipal record on 5 April 1474, when he is named along with two brothers and a sister.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n's-Hertogenbosch was a flourishing city in 15th-century [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]], in the south of the present-day Netherlands, at the time part of the [[Burgundian Netherlands]], and during its lifetime passing through marriage to the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburgs]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}} In 1463, four thousand houses in the town were destroyed by a catastrophic fire, which the then (approximately) thirteen-year-old Bosch presumably witnessed.

It is attributed by Fischer as a transition painting rendered by Bosch from between his middle period and his late period. In the left hand panel God presents [[Eve]] to [[Adam]]; innovatively God is given a youthful appearance. The figures are set in a landscape populated by exotic animals and unusual semi-organic hut-shaped forms. The central panel is a broad panorama teeming with nude figures engaged in innocent, self-absorbed joy, as well as fantastical compound animals, oversized fruit, and hybrid stone formations.<ref>Fraenger, 10</ref>\n\nThe right panel presents a hellscape; a world in which humankind has succumbed to the temptations of evil and is reaping eternal damnation. Set at night, the panel features cold colours, tortured figures and frozen waterways. The nakedness of the human figures has lost any eroticism suggested in the central panel,<ref>Belting, 38</ref> as large explosions in the background throw light through the city gate and spill onto the water in the panel's midground.<ref>Gibson, 92</ref>\n\n[[File:Hieronymus Bosch - The Garden of Earthly Delights - Hell.jpg|thumb|200px|Hell panel from ''[[The Garden of Earthly Delights]]''. It is alleged that Bosch's self-portrait is in the upper centre at right under the \"table\".]]\n\n== Interpretation ==\nIn the 20th century, when changing artistic tastes made artists like Bosch more palatable to the European imagination, it was sometimes argued that Bosch's art was inspired by heretical points of view (e.g., the ideas of the [[Cathars]] and/or putative [[Adamites]] or [[Brethren of the Free Spirit]])<ref>''The Millenium of Hieronymus Bosch. Outlines of a New Interpretation''. [[Wilhelm Fraenger]], University of Chicago Press, Chicago, 1951</ref> as well as by obscure hermetic practices. Again, since [[Erasmus]] had been educated at one of the houses of the [[Brethren of the Common Life]] in 's-Hertogenbosch, and the town was religiously progressive, some writers have found it unsurprising that strong parallels exist between the caustic writing of Erasmus and the often bold painting of Bosch.<ref>''The Secret Life of Paintings''. Richard Foster & Pamela Tudor-Craig {{ISBN|0-85115-439-5}}</ref>\n\nOthers, following a strain of Bosch-interpretation datable already to the 16th century, continued to think his work was created merely to titillate and amuse, much like the \"[[grotesque|grotteschi]]\" of the [[Italian Renaissance]]. While the art of the older masters was based in the physical world of everyday experience, Bosch confronts his viewer with, in the words of the art historian Walter Gibson, \"a world of dreams [and] nightmares in which forms seem to flicker and change before our eyes\". In one of the first known accounts of Bosch's paintings, in 1560 the Spaniard [[Felipe de Guevara]] wrote that Bosch was regarded merely as \"the inventor of [[monster]]s and [[Chimera (mythology)|chimeras]]\". In the early 17th century, the artist-biographer [[Karel van Mander]] described Bosch's work as comprising \"wondrous and strange fantasies\"; however, he concluded that the paintings are \"often less pleasant than gruesome to look at\".<ref>Gibson, 9</ref>\n\nIn recent decades, scholars have come to view Bosch's vision as less fantastic, and accepted that his art reflects the orthodox religious belief systems of his age.<ref name=Bosing>{{cite book|last1=Bosing|first1=Walter|title=Hieronymus Bosch|date=1987|publisher=Taschen}}</ref> His depictions of sinful humanity and his conceptions of Heaven and Hell are now seen as consistent with those of late medieval [[didactic]] literature and sermons. Most writers attach a more profound significance to his paintings than had previously been supposed, and attempt to interpret them in terms of a late medieval morality. It is generally accepted that Bosch's art was created to teach specific moral and spiritual truths in the manner of other [[Northern Renaissance]] figures, such as the poet [[Robert Henryson]], and that the images rendered have precise and premeditated significance. According to Dirk Bax, Bosch's paintings often represent visual translations of verbal metaphors and puns drawn from both biblical and folkloric sources.<ref>Bax, 1949.</ref> However, the conflict of interpretations that his works still elicit raises profound questions about the nature of \"ambiguity\" in art of his period.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nLatterly art historians have added a further dimension to the subject of ambiguity in Bosch's work, emphasising ironic tendencies, for example in ''[[The Garden of Earthly Delights]]'', both in the central panel (delights),<ref>Pokorny (2010), 23, 25, 31.</ref> and the right panel (hell).<ref>Boulboull\u00e9 (2008), 68, 70\u201372, 75\u201376.</ref> They theorise that the irony offers the option of detachment, both from the real world and from the painted fantasy world, thus appealing to both conservative and progressive viewers.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nA 2012 study<ref>Oliveira, Paulo Martins, ''Jheronimus Bosch'', 2012, pp.27, 199\u2013218. {{ISBN|978-1-4791-6765-4}}.</ref> on Bosch's paintings alleges that they actually conceal a strong nationalist consciousness, censuring the foreign imperial government of the [[Burgundian Netherlands]], especially [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian Habsburg]]. By systematically superimposing images and concepts, the study asserts that Bosch also made his expiatory self-punishment, for he was accepting well-paid commissions from the Habsburgs and their deputies, and therefore betraying the memory of [[Charles the Bold]].<ref>Oliveira, Paulo Martins, ''Bosch, the surdo canis'', 2013 (on-line paper).</ref>\n\n==Debates on attribution==\n\n[[File:Bosch follower Christ Before Pilate (Princeton).jpg|thumb|''Christ Before Pilate'', ca. 1520, one of the paintings with disputed attribution, in the [[Princeton University Art Museum]] which would date from Bosch's Late period of painting.]]\n\nThe exact number of Bosch's surviving works has been a subject of considerable debate. His signature can be seen on only seven of his surviving paintings, and there is uncertainty whether all the paintings once ascribed to him were actually from his hand. It is known that from the early 16th century onwards numerous copies and variations of his paintings began to circulate. In addition, his style was highly influential, and was widely imitated by his numerous followers.<ref>Gibson, 163</ref>\n\nOver the years, scholars have attributed to him fewer and fewer of the works once thought to be his. This is partly a result of technological advances such as [[infrared|infrared reflectography]], which enable researchers to examine a painting's underdrawing.<ref>Finaldi, Gabriele/ Garrido, Carmen \"El trazo oculto.

He is one of the most notable representatives of the [[Early Netherlandish painting]] school. His work contains fantastic illustrations of religious concepts and narratives.<ref>Catherine B. Scallen, ''The Art of the Northern Renaissance'' (Chantilly: The Teaching Company, 2007) Lecture 26</ref> Within his lifetime his work was collected in the Netherlands, Austria, and Spain, and widely copied, especially his macabre and nightmarish depictions of [[hell]].\n\nLittle is known of Bosch's life, though there are some records.  He spent most of it in the town of [['s-Hertogenbosch]], where he was born in his grandfather's house. The roots of his forefathers are in [[Nijmegen]] and [[Aachen]] (which is visible in his surname: Van Aken). His pessimistic and fantastical style cast a wide influence on northern art of the 16th century, with [[Pieter Bruegel the Elder]] being his best-known follower. Today he is seen as a hugely individualistic painter with deep insight into humanity's desires and deepest fears. Attribution has been especially difficult; today only about 25 paintings are confidently given to his hand<ref name=Siegal1Feb/> along with eight drawings. About another half dozen paintings are confidently attributed to his workshop. His most acclaimed works consist of a few [[triptych]] altarpieces, including ''[[The Garden of Earthly Delights]]''.\n\n==Life==\nHieronymus Bosch was born Jheronimus (or Joen,<ref>Dijck (2000): pp. 43\u201344.

He left behind no letters or diaries, and what has been identified has been taken from brief references to him in the municipal records of {{nowrap|'s-Hertogenbosch}}, and in the account books of the local order of the [[Illustrious Brotherhood of Our Blessed Lady]]. Nothing is known of his personality or his thoughts on the meaning of his art. Bosch's date of birth has not been determined with certainty. It is estimated at {{nowrap|{{circa}} 1450}} on the basis of a hand drawn portrait (which may be a self-portrait) made shortly before his death in 1516. The drawing shows the artist at an advanced age, probably in his late sixties.<ref>Gibson, 15\u201316</ref>\n\nBosch was born and lived all his life in and near {{nowrap|[['s-Hertogenbosch]]}}, a city in the [[Duchy of Brabant]]. His grandfather Jan van Aken (died 1454) was a painter and is first mentioned in the records in 1430. It is known that Jan had five sons, four of whom were also painters. Bosch's father, Anthonius van Aken (died {{circa}} 1478), acted as artistic adviser to the [[Illustrious Brotherhood of Our Blessed Lady]].<ref>Gibson, 15, 17</ref> It is generally assumed that either Bosch's father or one of his uncles taught the artist to paint, but none of their works survive.<ref>Gibson, 19</ref> Bosch first appears in the municipal record on 5 April 1474, when he is named along with two brothers and a sister.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n's-Hertogenbosch was a flourishing city in 15th-century [[Duchy of Brabant|Brabant]], in the south of the present-day Netherlands, at the time part of the [[Burgundian Netherlands]], and during its lifetime passing through marriage to the [[House of Habsburg|Habsburgs]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}} In 1463, four thousand houses in the town were destroyed by a catastrophic fire, which the then (approximately) thirteen-year-old Bosch presumably witnessed.

It is attributed by Fischer as a transition painting rendered by Bosch from between his middle period and his late period. In the left hand panel God presents [[Eve]] to [[Adam]]; innovatively God is given a youthful appearance. The figures are set in a landscape populated by exotic animals and unusual semi-organic hut-shaped forms. The central panel is a broad panorama teeming with nude figures engaged in innocent, self-absorbed joy, as well as fantastical compound animals, oversized fruit, and hybrid stone formations.<ref>Fraenger, 10</ref>\n\nThe right panel presents a hellscape; a world in which humankind has succumbed to the temptations of evil and is reaping eternal damnation. Set at night, the panel features cold colours, tortured figures and frozen waterways. The nakedness of the human figures has lost any eroticism suggested in the central panel,<ref>Belting, 38</ref> as large explosions in the background throw light through the city gate and spill onto the water in the panel's midground.<ref>Gibson, 92</ref>\n\n[[File:Hieronymus Bosch - The Garden of Earthly Delights - Hell.jpg|thumb|200px|Hell panel from ''[[The Garden of Earthly Delights]]''. It is alleged that Bosch's self-portrait is in the upper centre at right under the \"table\".]]\n\n== Interpretation ==\nIn the 20th century, when changing artistic tastes made artists like Bosch more palatable to the European imagination, it was sometimes argued that Bosch's art was inspired by heretical points of view (e.g., the ideas of the [[Cathars]] and/or putative [[Adamites]] or [[Brethren of the Free Spirit]])<ref>''The Millenium of Hieronymus Bosch. Outlines of a New Interpretation''. [[Wilhelm Fraenger]], University of Chicago Press, Chicago, 1951</ref> as well as by obscure hermetic practices. Again, since [[Erasmus]] had been educated at one of the houses of the [[Brethren of the Common Life]] in 's-Hertogenbosch, and the town was religiously progressive, some writers have found it unsurprising that strong parallels exist between the caustic writing of Erasmus and the often bold painting of Bosch.<ref>''The Secret Life of Paintings''. Richard Foster & Pamela Tudor-Craig {{ISBN|0-85115-439-5}}</ref>\n\nOthers, following a strain of Bosch-interpretation datable already to the 16th century, continued to think his work was created merely to titillate and amuse, much like the \"[[grotesque|grotteschi]]\" of the [[Italian Renaissance]]. While the art of the older masters was based in the physical world of everyday experience, Bosch confronts his viewer with, in the words of the art historian Walter Gibson, \"a world of dreams [and] nightmares in which forms seem to flicker and change before our eyes\". In one of the first known accounts of Bosch's paintings, in 1560 the Spaniard [[Felipe de Guevara]] wrote that Bosch was regarded merely as \"the inventor of [[monster]]s and [[Chimera (mythology)|chimeras]]\". In the early 17th century, the artist-biographer [[Karel van Mander]] described Bosch's work as comprising \"wondrous and strange fantasies\"; however, he concluded that the paintings are \"often less pleasant than gruesome to look at\".<ref>Gibson, 9</ref>\n\nIn recent decades, scholars have come to view Bosch's vision as less fantastic, and accepted that his art reflects the orthodox religious belief systems of his age.<ref name=Bosing>{{cite book|last1=Bosing|first1=Walter|title=Hieronymus Bosch|date=1987|publisher=Taschen}}</ref> His depictions of sinful humanity and his conceptions of Heaven and Hell are now seen as consistent with those of late medieval [[didactic]] literature and sermons. Most writers attach a more profound significance to his paintings than had previously been supposed, and attempt to interpret them in terms of a late medieval morality. It is generally accepted that Bosch's art was created to teach specific moral and spiritual truths in the manner of other [[Northern Renaissance]] figures, such as the poet [[Robert Henryson]], and that the images rendered have precise and premeditated significance. According to Dirk Bax, Bosch's paintings often represent visual translations of verbal metaphors and puns drawn from both biblical and folkloric sources.<ref>Bax, 1949.</ref> However, the conflict of interpretations that his works still elicit raises profound questions about the nature of \"ambiguity\" in art of his period.{{Citation needed|date=August 2019}}\n\nLatterly art historians have added a further dimension to the subject of ambiguity in Bosch's work, emphasising ironic tendencies, for example in ''[[The Garden of Earthly Delights]]'', both in the central panel (delights),<ref>Pokorny (2010), 23, 25, 31.</ref> and the right panel (hell).<ref>Boulboull\u00e9 (2008), 68, 70\u201372, 75\u201376.</ref> They theorise that the irony offers the option of detachment, both from the real world and from the painted fantasy world, thus appealing to both conservative and progressive viewers.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nA 2012 study<ref>Oliveira, Paulo Martins, ''Jheronimus Bosch'', 2012, pp.27, 199\u2013218. {{ISBN|978-1-4791-6765-4}}.</ref> on Bosch's paintings alleges that they actually conceal a strong nationalist consciousness, censuring the foreign imperial government of the [[Burgundian Netherlands]], especially [[Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian Habsburg]]. By systematically superimposing images and concepts, the study asserts that Bosch also made his expiatory self-punishment, for he was accepting well-paid commissions from the Habsburgs and their deputies, and therefore betraying the memory of [[Charles the Bold]].<ref>Oliveira, Paulo Martins, ''Bosch, the surdo canis'', 2013 (on-line paper).</ref>\n\n==Debates on attribution==\n\n[[File:Bosch follower Christ Before Pilate (Princeton).jpg|thumb|''Christ Before Pilate'', ca. 1520, one of the paintings with disputed attribution, in the [[Princeton University Art Museum]] which would date from Bosch's Late period of painting.]]\n\nThe exact number of Bosch's surviving works has been a subject of considerable debate. His signature can be seen on only seven of his surviving paintings, and there is uncertainty whether all the paintings once ascribed to him were actually from his hand. It is known that from the early 16th century onwards numerous copies and variations of his paintings began to circulate. In addition, his style was highly influential, and was widely imitated by his numerous followers.<ref>Gibson, 163</ref>\n\nOver the years, scholars have attributed to him fewer and fewer of the works once thought to be his. This is partly a result of technological advances such as [[infrared|infrared reflectography]], which enable researchers to examine a painting's underdrawing.<ref>Finaldi, Gabriele/ Garrido, Carmen \"El trazo oculto.

When offered a promotion to [[Partner (business rank)|junior partner]], she panics, flees the building, and happens to encounter Josh Chan, her boyfriend from summer camp, whom she hasn't seen since her teenage years. Josh tells her that he has found life in New York City does not suit him, and he is moving back to his hometown of [[West Covina, California]] (\"Just two hours from the beach, four hours in traffic\"). Rebecca decides to follow Josh to West Covina in search of happiness, while telling herself that Josh had little to do with her decision to move. Arriving in West Covina, she gets a job at Darryl Whitefeather's West Covina law firm, rents an apartment, and flushes all her depression and anxiety meds down the sink. She becomes friends with the firm's paralegal, Paula, and her neighbor, Heather, and begins an on-again-off-again relationship with Josh's friend Greg, all while trying to reconnect with Josh.\n\nIn the second season, Rebecca begins a romantic relationship with Josh; meanwhile, the wealthy, amoral Nathaniel Plimpton becomes a partner at Darryl's firm. Hoping to cement their troubled relationship, Rebecca and Josh plan to be married, but Josh leaves her at the altar. In the third season, Rebecca's emotional state hits rock bottom. After attempting suicide, she receives a diagnosis of [[borderline personality disorder]]. She begins attempting to take better care of her mental health and take responsibility for her actions; meanwhile she begins a long-term casual sexual relationship with Nathaniel. In the fourth season, with all the main cast members becoming more mature and emotionally healthy, Rebecca feels pressured to choose between romance with Josh, Nathaniel, and Greg. In the final episode, she decides she is not yet emotionally secure enough for a relationship with any of them, and instead spends a year focusing on figuring out her own emotional needs and pursuing her interest in songwriting.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{{Main|List of Crazy Ex-Girlfriend characters}} \n\n* [[Rachel Bloom]] as Rebecca Bunch, a lawyer, originally from [[Scarsdale, New York]]. Rebecca suffers symptoms of depression and [[anxiety]] and is prone to impulsive decisions and delusions, and tends to [[Hallucination|hallucinate]] when she's under emotional distress. Rebecca uproots her life and relocates to the suburb of West Covina, California, in an attempt to win back her crush, Josh Chan, whom she befriended in a summer camp ten years prior. Intelligent but often lacking awareness of appropriate behavior, Rebecca comes across as unpredictable, selfish, self-centered, needy, and eccentric to those around her. At the same time, she often tries hard to be kind and thoughtful, and makes loyal friends in West Covina. In the third season, she is diagnosed with [[borderline personality disorder]] (BPD) and makes positive steps towards managing her mental health, and in the fourth season, she quits her job as a lawyer, realizing it makes her unhappy.\n* [[Vincent Rodriguez III]] as Josh Chan, Rebecca's object of her affection for much of the series. Josh demonstrates commitment issues in his relationship with Rebecca and is an oblivious person. Like Rebecca, Josh has a tendency to be self-centered and immature. Josh has since improved as a person and had apologized to Rebecca for the mistakes he made in their relationship. He subsequently goes on a journey of self discovery as he tries to find his path and understand what he wants in life.\n* [[Santino Fontana]] (seasons 1\u20132) and [[Skylar Astin]] (season 4)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tvline.com/2018/08/06/crazy-ex-girlfriend-cast-skylar-astin-season-4-the-cw/|title=''Crazy Ex-Girlfriend'' Adds Skylar Astin to Play Greg (!) in Season 4 Recast|first=Dave|last=Nemetz|work=TVLine|date=August 6, 2018|accessdate=August 6, 2018}}</ref> as Greg Serrano, a smart but underachieving bartender and Josh's best friend, who has complicated feelings for Rebecca. He departs West Covina to attend business school at [[Emory University]], partly as a way to get away from his destructive relationship with Rebecca, despite his feelings for her. Although he struggles with alcoholism throughout season 1, he comes to terms with his addiction in season 2. He returns to West Covina in season 4, more emotionally healthy and played by a different actor.\n* [[Donna Lynne Champlin]] as Paula Proctor, Rebecca's co-worker and new best friend. As a way to distract herself from her own failing marriage, Paula hatches schemes and gives questionable advice in support of Rebecca's pursuit of Josh, mostly to compensate for her lack of fulfillment from not pursuing her dreams when she was younger. She later begins to focus instead on pursuing her law degree and establishes healthier boundaries with Rebecca, distancing herself from her past scheming. She and her husband Scott tend to be neglectful parents to their two sons.\n* [[Pete Gardner]] as Darryl Whitefeather, Rebecca's sentimental, emotional and often clueless boss. A middle-aged divorced dad, he discovers he is [[bisexual]] and begins dating White Josh. He is prone to feelings of loneliness and neediness over the fact that he originally lacked strong friendships and real personal connections with others. He later forms friendships with his colleagues Maya, Nathaniel, Rebecca, and Paula, whom he considers his best friend. He and White Josh break up in the third season due to Darryl's desire to have a baby, but remain good friends. Although he has a good heart, Darryl's neediness and persistence can push people away from him.\n* [[Vella Lovell]] as Heather Davis, Rebecca's cool college student neighbor, and later roommate. She is apathetic and sardonic, and lacks motivation for obtaining achievement or self-sufficiency, because her parents encouraged failure and coddled her. In season 3, Heather is forced by her college to graduate despite her wishes, and later becomes a regional manager for three Home Base bars as well as Darryl's surrogate. She briefly dates Greg in season 1; in season 3, she starts a relationship with Hector, whom she eventually marries.\n* [[Gabrielle Ruiz]] as Valencia Perez, Josh's controlling girlfriend and Rebecca's rival for Josh's affections. She initially had a strong resistance to forming relationships with women, as she saw them as competition, making her disliked by her female peers. She has insecurity about her body image and can be condescending to people who she feels don't meet her standards. After breaking up with Josh, she questions her life choices and feels she lacks fulfilment, having devoted 15 years of her life to Josh. After Rebecca also breaks up with Josh, she and Valencia become close friends. Valencia later meets and falls in love with a woman named Beth, with whom she runs a party planning business. (recurring, season 1; main, seasons 2\u20134)\n* [[David Hull (actor)|David Hull]] as Josh Wilson, Josh Chan's friend, a laid-back fitness instructor nicknamed \"White Josh\" to differentiate him from Josh Chan, who is Filipino. He begins dating Darryl after the latter comes out as bisexual. White Josh tends to be judgmental, yet he is one of the most level-headed, rational characters in his social sphere. He and Darryl break up over Darryl's desire to have a baby, but stay on friendly terms. (recurring, seasons 1\u20132; main, season 3; special guest star, season 4)\n* [[Scott Michael Foster]] as Nathaniel Plimpton III, a wealthy and successful lawyer and Rebecca's new boss in season 2 after he buys equity in Whitefeather & Associates. He and Rebecca have a complicated relationship due to mutual dislike yet intense physical attraction to one other, and explore a relationship through part of season 3. He possesses an inferiority complex, feeling that he needs to live up to his father's expectations; he tends to become self-loathing and defeatist when he fails to do so. Nathaniel exhibits some [[sociopath]]ic tendencies; for example, he has suggested the murder of another character's relative as revenge. After experiencing feelings of loss and abandonment after his breakup with Rebecca, he resolves to become a kinder person.

When offered a promotion to [[Partner (business rank)|junior partner]], she panics, flees the building, and happens to encounter Josh Chan, her boyfriend from summer camp, whom she hasn't seen since her teenage years. Josh tells her that he has found life in New York City does not suit him, and he is moving back to his hometown of [[West Covina, California]] (\"Just two hours from the beach, four hours in traffic\"). Rebecca decides to follow Josh to West Covina in search of happiness, while telling herself that Josh had little to do with her decision to move. Arriving in West Covina, she gets a job at Darryl Whitefeather's West Covina law firm, rents an apartment, and flushes all her depression and anxiety meds down the sink. She becomes friends with the firm's paralegal, Paula, and her neighbor, Heather, and begins an on-again-off-again relationship with Josh's friend Greg, all while trying to reconnect with Josh.\n\nIn the second season, Rebecca begins a romantic relationship with Josh; meanwhile, the wealthy, amoral Nathaniel Plimpton becomes a partner at Darryl's firm. Hoping to cement their troubled relationship, Rebecca and Josh plan to be married, but Josh leaves her at the altar. In the third season, Rebecca's emotional state hits rock bottom. After attempting suicide, she receives a diagnosis of [[borderline personality disorder]]. She begins attempting to take better care of her mental health and take responsibility for her actions; meanwhile she begins a long-term casual sexual relationship with Nathaniel. In the fourth season, with all the main cast members becoming more mature and emotionally healthy, Rebecca feels pressured to choose between romance with Josh, Nathaniel, and Greg. In the final episode, she decides she is not yet emotionally secure enough for a relationship with any of them, and instead spends a year focusing on figuring out her own emotional needs and pursuing her interest in songwriting.\n\n==Cast and characters==\n{{Main|List of Crazy Ex-Girlfriend characters}} \n\n* [[Rachel Bloom]] as Rebecca Bunch, a lawyer, originally from [[Scarsdale, New York]]. Rebecca suffers symptoms of depression and [[anxiety]] and is prone to impulsive decisions and delusions, and tends to [[Hallucination|hallucinate]] when she's under emotional distress. Rebecca uproots her life and relocates to the suburb of West Covina, California, in an attempt to win back her crush, Josh Chan, whom she befriended in a summer camp ten years prior. Intelligent but often lacking awareness of appropriate behavior, Rebecca comes across as unpredictable, selfish, self-centered, needy, and eccentric to those around her. At the same time, she often tries hard to be kind and thoughtful, and makes loyal friends in West Covina. In the third season, she is diagnosed with [[borderline personality disorder]] (BPD) and makes positive steps towards managing her mental health, and in the fourth season, she quits her job as a lawyer, realizing it makes her unhappy.\n* [[Vincent Rodriguez III]] as Josh Chan, Rebecca's object of her affection for much of the series. Josh demonstrates commitment issues in his relationship with Rebecca and is an oblivious person. Like Rebecca, Josh has a tendency to be self-centered and immature. Josh has since improved as a person and had apologized to Rebecca for the mistakes he made in their relationship. He subsequently goes on a journey of self discovery as he tries to find his path and understand what he wants in life.\n* [[Santino Fontana]] (seasons 1\u20132) and [[Skylar Astin]] (season 4)<ref>{{cite web|url=https://tvline.com/2018/08/06/crazy-ex-girlfriend-cast-skylar-astin-season-4-the-cw/|title=''Crazy Ex-Girlfriend'' Adds Skylar Astin to Play Greg (!) in Season 4 Recast|first=Dave|last=Nemetz|work=TVLine|date=August 6, 2018|accessdate=August 6, 2018}}</ref> as Greg Serrano, a smart but underachieving bartender and Josh's best friend, who has complicated feelings for Rebecca. He departs West Covina to attend business school at [[Emory University]], partly as a way to get away from his destructive relationship with Rebecca, despite his feelings for her. Although he struggles with alcoholism throughout season 1, he comes to terms with his addiction in season 2. He returns to West Covina in season 4, more emotionally healthy and played by a different actor.\n* [[Donna Lynne Champlin]] as Paula Proctor, Rebecca's co-worker and new best friend. As a way to distract herself from her own failing marriage, Paula hatches schemes and gives questionable advice in support of Rebecca's pursuit of Josh, mostly to compensate for her lack of fulfillment from not pursuing her dreams when she was younger. She later begins to focus instead on pursuing her law degree and establishes healthier boundaries with Rebecca, distancing herself from her past scheming. She and her husband Scott tend to be neglectful parents to their two sons.\n* [[Pete Gardner]] as Darryl Whitefeather, Rebecca's sentimental, emotional and often clueless boss. A middle-aged divorced dad, he discovers he is [[bisexual]] and begins dating White Josh. He is prone to feelings of loneliness and neediness over the fact that he originally lacked strong friendships and real personal connections with others. He later forms friendships with his colleagues Maya, Nathaniel, Rebecca, and Paula, whom he considers his best friend. He and White Josh break up in the third season due to Darryl's desire to have a baby, but remain good friends. Although he has a good heart, Darryl's neediness and persistence can push people away from him.\n* [[Vella Lovell]] as Heather Davis, Rebecca's cool college student neighbor, and later roommate. She is apathetic and sardonic, and lacks motivation for obtaining achievement or self-sufficiency, because her parents encouraged failure and coddled her. In season 3, Heather is forced by her college to graduate despite her wishes, and later becomes a regional manager for three Home Base bars as well as Darryl's surrogate. She briefly dates Greg in season 1; in season 3, she starts a relationship with Hector, whom she eventually marries.\n* [[Gabrielle Ruiz]] as Valencia Perez, Josh's controlling girlfriend and Rebecca's rival for Josh's affections. She initially had a strong resistance to forming relationships with women, as she saw them as competition, making her disliked by her female peers. She has insecurity about her body image and can be condescending to people who she feels don't meet her standards. After breaking up with Josh, she questions her life choices and feels she lacks fulfilment, having devoted 15 years of her life to Josh.

It reached No. 1 in the UK, giving the band their first number one single, and remained in the charts for fifteen weeks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/30945/slade/ |title=slade &#124; full Official Chart History &#124; Official Charts Company |publisher=Officialcharts.com |date= |accessdate=2017-07-24}}</ref>\n\nIn 1972, a compilation album of the [[Coz I Luv You (album)|same name]] would be released outside the UK.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Slade-Coz-I-Luv-You/master/33028 |title=Slade - Coz I Luv You at Discogs |publisher=Discogs.com |date= |accessdate=2017-10-19}}</ref> The song was included on the compilation and would also feature on the band's 1973 compilation album ''[[Sladest]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.discogs.com/Slade-Sladest/master/12024 |title=Slade - Sladest at Discogs |publisher=Discogs.com |date=2010-03-24 |accessdate=2017-07-24}}</ref>\n\n==Background==\nSlade achieved their commercial breakthrough with the release of their version of [[Bobby Marchan]]'s \"[[Get Down and Get with It]]\" in May 1971. Deciding to capture their strong reputation as a live act onto record, \"Get Down and Get with It\" was seen as the perfect choice as the band frequently played it live to a great response. Successfully breaking the band into the UK and Europe, it reached No. 16 in the UK.<ref>{{cite book |title=Slade, Feel the Noize!: an illustrated biography |last=Charlesworth |first=Chris |authorlink=Chris Charlesworth |year=1984 |publisher=Omnibus Press |location=London |isbn=0-7119-0538-X |page=31 |pages= |url= }}</ref> \"Coz I Luv You\" was soon recorded as the follow-up single.

The song was written after Chandler insisted the band write an original song as their next single. One evening, Lea turned up Holder's home with his violin and an idea for a song after hearing \"Nine By Nine\" by the [[John Dummer Band|John Dummer Blues Band]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Slade, Feel the Noize!: an illustrated biography |last=Charlesworth |first=Chris |authorlink=Chris Charlesworth |year=1984 |publisher=Omnibus Press |location=London |isbn=0-7119-0538-X |page=32 |pages= |url= }}</ref> Lea suggested that he and Holder write a song which had a [[Django Reinhardt]]/[[Stephan Grapelli]] \"Hot Club\"-influence. The pair wrote the song in half an hour and began the successful songwriting partnership of Holder/Lea, which would go on to write the bulk of Slade's material.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.45worlds.com/cdalbum/cd/5371052uk |title=CD Album - Slade - Greatest Hits - Feel The Noize - Polydor - UK |publisher=45worlds.com |date=2015-02-09 |accessdate=2017-10-19}}</ref> The following day, the band played the song acoustically to Chandler, who responded: \"I think you've written your first hit record. In fact, I think you've written your first No. 1.\"<ref name=\"google1\">{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=vuAr5Losd2sC&printsec=frontcover&dq=noddy+holder&hl=en&sa=X&redir_esc=y#v=snippet&q=coz%20i%20luv%20you&f=false |title=Who's Crazee Now?: My Autobiography - Lisa Verrico, Noddy Holder - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2017-10-19}}</ref>\n\nImmediately booking the band into Olympic Studios in Barnes, the song was recorded in two days. Although Chandler liked the song, the band were less enthusiastic as they believed it to be too poppy and weak-sounding in comparison to \"Get Down and Get with It\". In the effort to make the record more Slade-like, the band added foot-stomping and hand-clapping to it. Furthermore, the band thought the original title, \"Because I Love You\", did not suit the band's image or sound. Holder then suggested spelling the title to reflect their Black County dialect. The title then became \"Coz I Luv You\", which marked the beginning of Slade's misspelling trademark.<ref name=\"google1\"/>\n\nIn a 1980 interview with ''[[Sounds (magazine)|Sounds]]'', Lea said of the song: \"I didn't even like some of those old ones. \"Coz I Luv You\" was namby-pamby to us, a throwaway for an album. It shot to number one in two weeks and we thought, \"What a pile of shit!\" It was so wet.\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timesup.dsl.pipex.com/clip01.html |title=Related Links |publisher=Timesup.dsl.pipex.com |date=29 October 2005 |accessdate=10 August 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120328032755/http://www.timesup.dsl.pipex.com/clip01.html |archivedate=28 March 2012 }}</ref><ref>Sounds Magazine \u2013 15 November 1980 \u2013 Back From The Dead - Steve Keaton meets Noddy Holder and Jim Lea of Slade</ref> Later in a 1984 interview with ''[[Record Mirror]]'', Lea said: \"One afternoon I went over to Nod's and I said \"Hey Nod, why don't we write a song?\". I took my violin with me and said why don't we do a Stephan Grappelli thing. \"Hot Love\" was in the charts at the time - [[Marc Bolan]], and I said something like that, dead simple and we wrote the song in half an hour. We got the structure of the tune and Nod just filled in the gaps. That's the only song we've ever written like that.\"\n\n==Release==\n\"Coz I Luv You\" was released on 7\" vinyl by Polydor Records in the UK, Ireland, across Europe, Scandinavia, Yugoslavia, Israel, Canada, South Africa, Australia, New Zealand, Argentina, Brazil and Japan.

More recently the song was used in an episode of the BBC drama ''[[Life on Mars (UK TV series)|Life on Mars]]''. The song also features in the 2004 film ''[[El Lobo]]'' (also known as ''The Wolf''), a political thriller revolving around the [[Spain|Spanish]] terrorist group [[ETA (separatist group)|ETA]].<ref>https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0385842/soundtrack</ref>\n\n==Promotion==\nNo music video was filmed to promote the single. In the UK, the band performed the song on the UK music show ''[[Top of the Pops]]''. The band also performed the song on the Belgian TV show ''Popshop'' and the German TV shows ''Disco'' and ''Beat Club''.

The song was written after Chandler insisted the band write an original song as their next single. One evening, Lea turned up Holder's home with his violin and an idea for a song after hearing \"Nine By Nine\" by the [[John Dummer Band|John Dummer Blues Band]].<ref>{{cite book |title=Slade, Feel the Noize!: an illustrated biography |last=Charlesworth |first=Chris |authorlink=Chris Charlesworth |year=1984 |publisher=Omnibus Press |location=London |isbn=0-7119-0538-X |page=32 |pages= |url= }}</ref> Lea suggested that he and Holder write a song which had a [[Django Reinhardt]]/[[Stephan Grapelli]] \"Hot Club\"-influence. The pair wrote the song in half an hour and began the successful songwriting partnership of Holder/Lea, which would go on to write the bulk of Slade's material.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.45worlds.com/cdalbum/cd/5371052uk |title=CD Album - Slade - Greatest Hits - Feel The Noize - Polydor - UK |publisher=45worlds.com |date=2015-02-09 |accessdate=2017-10-19}}</ref> The following day, the band played the song acoustically to Chandler, who responded: \"I think you've written your first hit record.

Although Chandler liked the song, the band were less enthusiastic as they believed it to be too poppy and weak-sounding in comparison to \"Get Down and Get with It\". In the effort to make the record more Slade-like, the band added foot-stomping and hand-clapping to it. Furthermore, the band thought the original title, \"Because I Love You\", did not suit the band's image or sound. Holder then suggested spelling the title to reflect their Black County dialect. The title then became \"Coz I Luv You\", which marked the beginning of Slade's misspelling trademark.<ref name=\"google1\"/>\n\nIn a 1980 interview with ''[[Sounds (magazine)|Sounds]]'', Lea said of the song: \"I didn't even like some of those old ones. \"Coz I Luv You\" was namby-pamby to us, a throwaway for an album.

A wise old man (known as apo), seeing the perils of disunity, exerted great effort toward uniting the warring tribes. There were, however, some who bitterly opposed his idea, and one day the old man just disappeared without a trace.\n\nAfter a long search, the old man's body was found, but with the head missing. It is said that the tribesmen launched search parties to locate the severed head of the man; to the [[Sambal people|Sambals]], decapitation was the only permissible form of assassination.<ref>It was [http://www.elaput.org/loarca05.htm recorded] as customary for the Sambal to execute those who have taken another person's life, unless done by decapitation. Their manner of execution was to bore a hole at the top of the skull and then scrape out the brains.</ref>\n\nThese efforts proved to be futile, and the search was eventually called off. A young boy, however, vowed to himself that he'll never stop searching until he found the elder's head. He searched for weeks, but found nothing. Then, one day, he chanced upon what appeared to be the old man's head, resting on top of a [[bamboo]] pole. The boy, while holding the severed head, ran back to his people crying, \"''Olo nin apo! Olo nin apo!''\" (\"head of the elder\" in [[Sambal language|Sambal]]; translates as \"''ulo ng apo''\"<ref>[http://olongapo-subic.com/olongapo_city_subic_bay_zambales_museum_legend.htm Olongapo Subic Bay sbma Zambales daily news jobs travel tour info] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927211901/http://olongapo-subic.com/olongapo_city_subic_bay_zambales_museum_legend.htm |date=September 27, 2007 }}.

The phrase stuck, and that, according to legend, is how the area got its name, Olongapo.\n\nTo this day, the old man's head acts as a symbol of the people's unity in what is now a modern city.\n\n==History==\n\n===British period===\n\nBritain ruled the Philippines for a short time, from 1762 to 1764. The British invasion of the Philippines was the first challenge to Spain's control of the archipelago after 191 years of rule. The Royal Navy and British Army joined with the East India Company in Madras to capture Spain's Asian colony. In conjunction with the attack against Spain's key possession in the Americas, Havana, both settlements were successfully seized. However, in the Philippines, whilst the expedition was launched as part of a plan to harass the Spaniards in their possessions, as well as for commercial gain and new territories, the military campaign led by General [[William Draper (British Army officer)|William Draper]] and Admiral [[Sir Samuel Cornish, 1st Baronet|Samuel Cornish]], may have been launched under the guise of an invasion in order to gain prize money. The publication \"When Britain Ruled the Philippines 1762\u20131764\" describes the events as they unfolded at the Admiralty in London and at the East India Company in Madras, leading to the invasion and occupation of the capital city of Manila and the port city of Cavite. The capital was looted, a galleon was seized, and the British commanders imposed a ransom of four million dollars upon the Spaniards. The enormous sums in prize money and valuables seized mainly benefited the commanders.\n\n===Spanish period===\n\nIn 1868, a Spanish military expedition was dispatched to study the possibility of relocating the Cavite Naval Station in Subic Bay due to its unhealthy condition.\n\nSpanish [[King Alfonso XII]] through a Royal Decree made Subic Bay (then called Subig) as Spain's stronghold in the Far East in 1884. Vice Admiral Juan Bautista de Antiquiera made Olongapo a settlement for the Spanish Navy.\n\nOn March 8, 1885, the [[Spanish Navy|Spanish Naval]] commission authorized construction of the Arsenal in Olongapo. The Spanish planned to make their naval station, and the village of Olongapo an island, protected against attack by rebels. The Spanish Navy Yard occupied the entire area east of the Spanish Gate. Employing Filipino labor, they did extensive dredging of the harbor and the inner basin and built a drainage canal.  The canal served both to drain the swampy area around the yard and also to form a line of defense.\n\nWithin ten years, the Spaniards had erected walls and markers to fence off the arsenal. They had shops and buildings erected. The Spanish government spent almost three decades developing the naval station. From higher naval commands, the order was sent to fortify Grande Island at the mouth of Subic Bay with mines and cannons. But this project was hardly begun before it was overtaken by the rout of the Spanish Navy in Manila Bay by US Admiral [[George Dewey]].<ref name=historyspain1>{{cite web|url= http://olongapo-subic.com/olongapo_city_subic_bay_zambales_museum_history.htm|title= History of Subic Bay and Olongapo City}}</ref><ref name=historyspain2>{{cite web|url= http://www.subicbaypi.com/sub_stories_olongapostory.htm|title= The Olongapo Story}}</ref><ref name=historyspain3>{{cite web|url= http://olongapo-city-philippines.blogspot.com/2009/11/olongapo-city-barangay-and-history.html|title= Olongapo City Barangay and History}}</ref><ref name=historyspain4>{{cite web|url= https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:m51J0h_0nXMJ:www.olongapocity.gov.ph/History.html&client=firefox-a&hl=en&gl=ph&strip=1|title= History of Olongapo City}}</ref>\n\n===American period===\n[[File:Aerial view Olangapo Naval Station 1928 NARA 19-LC-19C.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of the Olongapo Naval Station in 1928]]\nOn May 1, 1898, the construction of the Spanish Administration Building was hardly completed when [[Admiral Dewey]]'s flagship, {{USS|Olympia|C-6|6}}, led the [[Asiatic Fleet]] into [[Manila Bay]]. A detachment of Admiral Dewey's fleet bombarded the navy yard.  Eventually, after the surrender, Spain relinquished all her rights in the Philippines to the United States.  This marked the end of more than three hundred years of Spanish rule over the islands.\n\nRealizing the tremendous importance of Olongapo as a naval facility, the U.S. Navy decided to keep the base in functioning order; the President of the United States, then [[Theodore Roosevelt]], on November 9, 1901, by executive order, reserved the waters of Subic and some of the adjacent lands for naval purposes.\n\nThe naval station was widened and with the establishment of the American rule in the Philippines. American defenses in the islands were facilities left by the Spanish Navy which were taken over by the United States.\n\nOlongapo grew in direct proportion to the growth of the naval station.  More people came to live in Olongapo since the Navy offered employment.  To most Filipinos during that time, it was a welcome change.  The promise of a different kind of experience as shop workers and office help induced many young men to leave their farms and fishing boats to work in the Navy Yard.  Others finding the lure of the sea irresistible joined the U.S. Navy.\n\nOlongapo impressed its visitors as being one of the finest communities in the country. People passing through the town never failed to comment on its cleanliness and orderliness.<ref name=historyspain1 /><ref name=historyspain2 />\n\n===World War II===\n\nWhen the war broke out in 1941, the old town was obliterated.  Olongapo had to suffer the brunt of destruction twice.\n\nOn December 14, 1941, Japanese bombers attacked the Olongapo/Subic Bay area. Ten days later, the order was given to burn Subic Bay Naval Station and withdraw.  Olongapo was set aflame by the local Filipinos in anticipation of Japanese troop arrival.  The USS ''[[USS New York (ACR-2)|New York]]'' was scuttled in Subic Bay.<ref>[http://www.subicbaypi.com/subic_timeline40.htm Subic Bay History \u2013 1940's]. Subicbaypi.com (April 8, 1942). Retrieved on 2013-07-28.</ref> When the American forces made a last-ditch stand on the [[Bataan]] peninsula, the Naval Station was abandoned and most of its facilities were burned before the Japanese came.\n\nIn 1945, Olongapo was again bombed, shelled and burned. Joint American and Philippine Commonwealth ground troops aided the recognized guerrilla fighters in liberating Olongapo from the Japanese forces. With the exceptions of the Station Chapel (it was the Olongapo Parish Church before the war) and the Spanish Gate, none of its former landmarks withstood the sweep of the war's fury. The general headquarters between the [[United States Army]], [[Philippine Commonwealth Army]] & [[Philippine Constabulary]] was stationed in Olongapo during and aftermath in [[World War II]] and active on 1945 to 1946 were operated against the Japanese for the liberation in [[Central Luzon]].\n\n===Reconstruction and rehabilitation===\nShortly after the war was over, the Philippines was granted independence.  Olongapo was one of the principal navy bases retained by the US. The Navy started to rebuild the town after the hostilities ceased. Olongapo was built on a new undeveloped site a couple of miles north of its former location.  The prewar town site became a part of the Naval Station.\n\nThe first few years after the war were difficult for the new town, as everything in the new Olongapo was in a deplorable state.  There was no electric power and no drainage system.  The water supply and sanitation facilities were inadequate, and streets were unpaved.<ref name=historyspain2 /> Gradually, Olongapo evolved into a better community:  new businesses were established; housing projects were planned, civic facilities were restored.\n\nDue to the Korean War, the US spent over $170 million to convert the base into the homeport of her Navy's Seventh Fleet, developing the Cubi Naval Air Station as the largest US installation of its kind in Asia. Naval authorities relocated the residence from the area of the former Public Works Center area to what is now the hub of Olongapo \u2013 along what is now known as Rizal Avenue and Ramon Magsaysay Drive, and in the Barangays New Asinan and New Kalalake areas. Zoning of Olongapo was patterned after American practice where streets are constructed along straight lines. The magnitude of facilities construction in the Olongapo and Subic Bay area brought growth and prosperity to Olongapo. By 1956, migrants from nearby towns and provinces had swelled the population to 39,180.<ref name=history5>{{cite web|url= http://www.olongapocity.gov.ph/?page_id=219|title= World War II \u2013 Olongapo City Official Website}}</ref>\n\n===Independence and Cityhood===\n[[File:Olongapo and bridge leading to NS Subic Bay.jpg|thumb|Olongapo and the bridge leading to NS Subic Bay, 1981.]]\n\nUnlike the rest of the Philippines which gained independence from the United States after [[World War II]] in 1946, Olongapo was governed as a part of the United States naval reservation.  The Subic Bay Naval Base commanding officer was chairman of the Olongapo town council, school board, and hospital board.  Olongapo's 60,000 Filipino residents paid taxes to the United States Navy and those accused of crimes involving American servicemen were tried in US Navy courts. In July 1955, Manila mayor [[Arsenio Lacson]] announced that US service personnel accused of crimes in Manila would be tried in Philippine courts because of US Navy abuses of Filipinos in Olongapo.  On October 23, 1959, Olongapo was placed under [[martial law]] when Robert Grant, the American owner of an Olongapo auto parts store was killed and the US Navy declined to identify or try the Naval Supply Depot sentry who shot him.<ref name=\"mtp\">Anderson, Gerald ''Subic Bay from Magellan to Pinatubo: The History of the U.S. Naval Station Subic Bay'' Gerald Anderson (2009) {{ISBN|1441444521}} pp.130\u2013138</ref>\n\nOlongapo City was the last piece of Philippine territory surrendered by the US to the country in the 1950s.<ref name=historyspain2 /><ref name=history3>{{cite web|url= http://info.worldbank.org/etools/docs/library/166856/UCMP/UCMP/Documents/olongapo.pdf|title= World Bank \u2013 Olongapo Profile}}</ref> On December 7, 1959, 56,000 acres of land with electrical, telephone and water utilities was relinquished to Philippine Secretary of Foreign Affairs Felixberto Serrano.<ref name=\"mtp\"/> The first mayor appointed was civic leader Ruben Geronimo and he was later succeeded by business entrepreneur Ildefonso Arriola.\n\nSix years later under Mayor [[James Leonard T.

The People of Olongapo; men, women, and even young adults led by City Officials and its Mayor Richard \"Dick\" Gordon, boldly bolted into a strong corps of 8,000 volunteers who protected and preserved the abandoned US Naval Base facilities from poachers. He complemented this with an aggressive advocacy to convert the area into a protected area and industrial zone. Later, he launched an aggressive international investment promotion which resulted in the acceleration of the development of a prime industrial and tourism zone in the country, the [[Subic Bay Freeport Zone]] (SBFZ).<ref name=history4 />\n\nAs the first chartered city and highly urbanized city in its province, it rose from being a \"sin city\" in the 1960s and 1970s into a \"model city\" in the 1980s and 2000s.<ref name=history3 />\n\nThe city is known for its innovative methods of urban management in the 1980s when it comes to addressing crime and sanitation that has been said to be copied by local governments nationwide.

The primary road that connects Olongapo to the rest of the other is the [[Jose Abad Santos Avenue]]. In the city's main district, the names of those streets running from North to South follow the English alphabet's order. While streets running East to West are numbered from 1st to 27th, starting from the South parallel and up. Even streets are on the East side of the City while the Odd streets are on the West.

However, in the late 2000s, the city faced debt in its electricity distribution costs amounting to P5 billion to power suppliers and threatened to cut the city from the Luzon power grid. Then Mayor James Gordon Jr. also attributed the crisis to low collection rate due to nonpayment or debts incurred by consumers, widespread energy theft and corruption in the PUD. The situation worsened because of interests imposed by Private Sector Assets and Liabilities Management Corp. (PSALM), the refusal of the Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC) to grant an increase in power rates, and the years of delay in the PUD's privatization.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/451401/olongapos-power-debt-burden|title=Olongapo\u2019s power debt burden|last=Gonzaga|first=Robert|website=newsinfo.inquirer.net|access-date=2016-07-03}}</ref>\n\nIn 2013, through Republic Act No. 10373, the PUD was sold for Php 610 million to [[Olongapo Electricity Distribution Company]] (OEDC), an affiliate of Cagayan Electric Power and Light Company (CEPALCO), which was given a 25-year franchise to take over the city's power distributor. The company has since upgraded the city's obsolete and dilapidated distribution network and has made significant improvements to the city's electricity services.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/371899/aquino-signs-law-on-olongapo-power-privatization|title=Aquino signs law on Olongapo power privatization|last=Inquirer|first=Philippine Daily|website=newsinfo.inquirer.net|access-date=2016-07-03}}</ref>\n\n==== Water ====\nWater services are provided by Subic Water and Sewerage Company (also known as Subic Water.

A wise old man (known as apo), seeing the perils of disunity, exerted great effort toward uniting the warring tribes. There were, however, some who bitterly opposed his idea, and one day the old man just disappeared without a trace.\n\nAfter a long search, the old man's body was found, but with the head missing. It is said that the tribesmen launched search parties to locate the severed head of the man; to the [[Sambal people|Sambals]], decapitation was the only permissible form of assassination.<ref>It was [http://www.elaput.org/loarca05.htm recorded] as customary for the Sambal to execute those who have taken another person's life, unless done by decapitation. Their manner of execution was to bore a hole at the top of the skull and then scrape out the brains.</ref>\n\nThese efforts proved to be futile, and the search was eventually called off. A young boy, however, vowed to himself that he'll never stop searching until he found the elder's head. He searched for weeks, but found nothing. Then, one day, he chanced upon what appeared to be the old man's head, resting on top of a [[bamboo]] pole. The boy, while holding the severed head, ran back to his people crying, \"''Olo nin apo! Olo nin apo!''\" (\"head of the elder\" in [[Sambal language|Sambal]]; translates as \"''ulo ng apo''\"<ref>[http://olongapo-subic.com/olongapo_city_subic_bay_zambales_museum_legend.htm Olongapo Subic Bay sbma Zambales daily news jobs travel tour info] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927211901/http://olongapo-subic.com/olongapo_city_subic_bay_zambales_museum_legend.htm |date=September 27, 2007 }}.

The phrase stuck, and that, according to legend, is how the area got its name, Olongapo.\n\nTo this day, the old man's head acts as a symbol of the people's unity in what is now a modern city.\n\n==History==\n\n===British period===\n\nBritain ruled the Philippines for a short time, from 1762 to 1764. The British invasion of the Philippines was the first challenge to Spain's control of the archipelago after 191 years of rule. The Royal Navy and British Army joined with the East India Company in Madras to capture Spain's Asian colony. In conjunction with the attack against Spain's key possession in the Americas, Havana, both settlements were successfully seized. However, in the Philippines, whilst the expedition was launched as part of a plan to harass the Spaniards in their possessions, as well as for commercial gain and new territories, the military campaign led by General [[William Draper (British Army officer)|William Draper]] and Admiral [[Sir Samuel Cornish, 1st Baronet|Samuel Cornish]], may have been launched under the guise of an invasion in order to gain prize money. The publication \"When Britain Ruled the Philippines 1762\u20131764\" describes the events as they unfolded at the Admiralty in London and at the East India Company in Madras, leading to the invasion and occupation of the capital city of Manila and the port city of Cavite. The capital was looted, a galleon was seized, and the British commanders imposed a ransom of four million dollars upon the Spaniards. The enormous sums in prize money and valuables seized mainly benefited the commanders.\n\n===Spanish period===\n\nIn 1868, a Spanish military expedition was dispatched to study the possibility of relocating the Cavite Naval Station in Subic Bay due to its unhealthy condition.\n\nSpanish [[King Alfonso XII]] through a Royal Decree made Subic Bay (then called Subig) as Spain's stronghold in the Far East in 1884. Vice Admiral Juan Bautista de Antiquiera made Olongapo a settlement for the Spanish Navy.\n\nOn March 8, 1885, the [[Spanish Navy|Spanish Naval]] commission authorized construction of the Arsenal in Olongapo. The Spanish planned to make their naval station, and the village of Olongapo an island, protected against attack by rebels. The Spanish Navy Yard occupied the entire area east of the Spanish Gate. Employing Filipino labor, they did extensive dredging of the harbor and the inner basin and built a drainage canal.  The canal served both to drain the swampy area around the yard and also to form a line of defense.\n\nWithin ten years, the Spaniards had erected walls and markers to fence off the arsenal. They had shops and buildings erected. The Spanish government spent almost three decades developing the naval station. From higher naval commands, the order was sent to fortify Grande Island at the mouth of Subic Bay with mines and cannons. But this project was hardly begun before it was overtaken by the rout of the Spanish Navy in Manila Bay by US Admiral [[George Dewey]].<ref name=historyspain1>{{cite web|url= http://olongapo-subic.com/olongapo_city_subic_bay_zambales_museum_history.htm|title= History of Subic Bay and Olongapo City}}</ref><ref name=historyspain2>{{cite web|url= http://www.subicbaypi.com/sub_stories_olongapostory.htm|title= The Olongapo Story}}</ref><ref name=historyspain3>{{cite web|url= http://olongapo-city-philippines.blogspot.com/2009/11/olongapo-city-barangay-and-history.html|title= Olongapo City Barangay and History}}</ref><ref name=historyspain4>{{cite web|url= https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:m51J0h_0nXMJ:www.olongapocity.gov.ph/History.html&client=firefox-a&hl=en&gl=ph&strip=1|title= History of Olongapo City}}</ref>\n\n===American period===\n[[File:Aerial view Olangapo Naval Station 1928 NARA 19-LC-19C.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of the Olongapo Naval Station in 1928]]\nOn May 1, 1898, the construction of the Spanish Administration Building was hardly completed when [[Admiral Dewey]]'s flagship, {{USS|Olympia|C-6|6}}, led the [[Asiatic Fleet]] into [[Manila Bay]]. A detachment of Admiral Dewey's fleet bombarded the navy yard.  Eventually, after the surrender, Spain relinquished all her rights in the Philippines to the United States.  This marked the end of more than three hundred years of Spanish rule over the islands.\n\nRealizing the tremendous importance of Olongapo as a naval facility, the U.S. Navy decided to keep the base in functioning order; the President of the United States, then [[Theodore Roosevelt]], on November 9, 1901, by executive order, reserved the waters of Subic and some of the adjacent lands for naval purposes.\n\nThe naval station was widened and with the establishment of the American rule in the Philippines. American defenses in the islands were facilities left by the Spanish Navy which were taken over by the United States.\n\nOlongapo grew in direct proportion to the growth of the naval station.  More people came to live in Olongapo since the Navy offered employment.  To most Filipinos during that time, it was a welcome change.  The promise of a different kind of experience as shop workers and office help induced many young men to leave their farms and fishing boats to work in the Navy Yard.  Others finding the lure of the sea irresistible joined the U.S. Navy.\n\nOlongapo impressed its visitors as being one of the finest communities in the country. People passing through the town never failed to comment on its cleanliness and orderliness.<ref name=historyspain1 /><ref name=historyspain2 />\n\n===World War II===\n\nWhen the war broke out in 1941, the old town was obliterated.  Olongapo had to suffer the brunt of destruction twice.\n\nOn December 14, 1941, Japanese bombers attacked the Olongapo/Subic Bay area. Ten days later, the order was given to burn Subic Bay Naval Station and withdraw.  Olongapo was set aflame by the local Filipinos in anticipation of Japanese troop arrival.  The USS ''[[USS New York (ACR-2)|New York]]'' was scuttled in Subic Bay.<ref>[http://www.subicbaypi.com/subic_timeline40.htm Subic Bay History \u2013 1940's]. Subicbaypi.com (April 8, 1942). Retrieved on 2013-07-28.</ref> When the American forces made a last-ditch stand on the [[Bataan]] peninsula, the Naval Station was abandoned and most of its facilities were burned before the Japanese came.\n\nIn 1945, Olongapo was again bombed, shelled and burned. Joint American and Philippine Commonwealth ground troops aided the recognized guerrilla fighters in liberating Olongapo from the Japanese forces. With the exceptions of the Station Chapel (it was the Olongapo Parish Church before the war) and the Spanish Gate, none of its former landmarks withstood the sweep of the war's fury. The general headquarters between the [[United States Army]], [[Philippine Commonwealth Army]] & [[Philippine Constabulary]] was stationed in Olongapo during and aftermath in [[World War II]] and active on 1945 to 1946 were operated against the Japanese for the liberation in [[Central Luzon]].\n\n===Reconstruction and rehabilitation===\nShortly after the war was over, the Philippines was granted independence.  Olongapo was one of the principal navy bases retained by the US. The Navy started to rebuild the town after the hostilities ceased. Olongapo was built on a new undeveloped site a couple of miles north of its former location.  The prewar town site became a part of the Naval Station.\n\nThe first few years after the war were difficult for the new town, as everything in the new Olongapo was in a deplorable state.  There was no electric power and no drainage system.  The water supply and sanitation facilities were inadequate, and streets were unpaved.<ref name=historyspain2 /> Gradually, Olongapo evolved into a better community:  new businesses were established; housing projects were planned, civic facilities were restored.\n\nDue to the Korean War, the US spent over $170 million to convert the base into the homeport of her Navy's Seventh Fleet, developing the Cubi Naval Air Station as the largest US installation of its kind in Asia. Naval authorities relocated the residence from the area of the former Public Works Center area to what is now the hub of Olongapo \u2013 along what is now known as Rizal Avenue and Ramon Magsaysay Drive, and in the Barangays New Asinan and New Kalalake areas. Zoning of Olongapo was patterned after American practice where streets are constructed along straight lines. The magnitude of facilities construction in the Olongapo and Subic Bay area brought growth and prosperity to Olongapo. By 1956, migrants from nearby towns and provinces had swelled the population to 39,180.<ref name=history5>{{cite web|url= http://www.olongapocity.gov.ph/?page_id=219|title= World War II \u2013 Olongapo City Official Website}}</ref>\n\n===Independence and Cityhood===\n[[File:Olongapo and bridge leading to NS Subic Bay.jpg|thumb|Olongapo and the bridge leading to NS Subic Bay, 1981.]]\n\nUnlike the rest of the Philippines which gained independence from the United States after [[World War II]] in 1946, Olongapo was governed as a part of the United States naval reservation.  The Subic Bay Naval Base commanding officer was chairman of the Olongapo town council, school board, and hospital board.  Olongapo's 60,000 Filipino residents paid taxes to the United States Navy and those accused of crimes involving American servicemen were tried in US Navy courts. In July 1955, Manila mayor [[Arsenio Lacson]] announced that US service personnel accused of crimes in Manila would be tried in Philippine courts because of US Navy abuses of Filipinos in Olongapo.  On October 23, 1959, Olongapo was placed under [[martial law]] when Robert Grant, the American owner of an Olongapo auto parts store was killed and the US Navy declined to identify or try the Naval Supply Depot sentry who shot him.<ref name=\"mtp\">Anderson, Gerald ''Subic Bay from Magellan to Pinatubo: The History of the U.S. Naval Station Subic Bay'' Gerald Anderson (2009) {{ISBN|1441444521}} pp.130\u2013138</ref>\n\n[[File:Olongapo City seal.svg|thumb|right|Seal of the city, [[National Historical Commission of the Philippines|NHCP]] version.]]\n\nOlongapo City was the last piece of Philippine territory surrendered by the US to the country in the 1950s.<ref name=historyspain2 /><ref name=history3>{{cite web|url= http://info.worldbank.org/etools/docs/library/166856/UCMP/UCMP/Documents/olongapo.pdf|title= World Bank \u2013 Olongapo Profile}}</ref> On December 7, 1959, 56,000 acres of land with electrical, telephone and water utilities was relinquished to Philippine Secretary of Foreign Affairs Felixberto Serrano.<ref name=\"mtp\"/> The first mayor appointed was civic leader Ruben Geronimo and he was later succeeded by business entrepreneur Ildefonso Arriola.\n\nSix years later under Mayor [[James Leonard T.

The minimum fare for tricycles are Php 7.50 per person, while Php 7.00 for jeepneys.\n\n[[Taxicab|Taxi]] services are also operated in the city but are limited. The taxis are not metered but have fixed rates depending on your origin and destination and they are generally used by tourists and residents alike for commuting inside the Subic Bay Freeport Zone.\n\n==== Bus Terminals ====\n[[Victory Liner]] and [[Saulog Transit]] are the leading bus operators having their own terminals in the city which transports people in and out of the city. Local bus terminals are also present and are primarily used for transportation in neighboring towns and inside the Subic Bay Freeport Zone.\n\n=====Road infrastructure=====\nOlongapo is accessible through the National Highway (via Zigzag Road) from [[Hermosa, Bataan|Hermosa]] and [[Dinalupihan, Bataan]]. The National Highway cuts through the city center and goes through north up to Barangay Barreto and then on to the neighboring town of Subic, and the rest of the towns in Zambales up to [[Pangasinan]] province. Another access to the city is via [[SCTEX]] and [[Subic\u2013Tipo Expressway]] exiting to the gates of Subic Bay Freeport Zone and also, from the south, Morong, Bataan (via Balanga, Bataan) through the Morong gate of Subic Bay Freeport Zone.\n\n=== Public Utilities ===\n\n==== Electricity ====\nElectricity services were formerly provided by the government-run Public Utilities Department (PUD) since the city was founded. However, in the late 2000s, the city faced debt in its electricity distribution costs amounting to P5 billion to power suppliers and threatened to cut the city from the Luzon power grid. Then Mayor James Gordon Jr. also attributed the crisis to low collection rate due to nonpayment or debts incurred by consumers, widespread energy theft and corruption in the PUD. The situation worsened because of interests imposed by Private Sector Assets and Liabilities Management Corp. (PSALM), the refusal of the Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC) to grant an increase in power rates, and the years of delay in the PUD's privatization.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/451401/olongapos-power-debt-burden|title=Olongapo\u2019s power debt burden|last=Gonzaga|first=Robert|website=newsinfo.inquirer.net|access-date=2016-07-03}}</ref>\n\nIn 2013, through Republic Act No. 10373, the PUD was sold for Php 610 million to [[Olongapo Electricity Distribution Company]] (OEDC), an affiliate of Cagayan Electric Power and Light Company (CEPALCO), which was given a 25-year franchise to take over the city's power distributor. The company has since upgraded the city's obsolete and dilapidated distribution network and has made significant improvements to the city's electricity services.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/371899/aquino-signs-law-on-olongapo-power-privatization|title=Aquino signs law on Olongapo power privatization|last=Inquirer|first=Philippine Daily|website=newsinfo.inquirer.net|access-date=2016-07-03}}</ref>\n\n==== Water ====\nWater services are provided by Subic Water and Sewerage Company (also known as Subic Water. Not to be confused with Subic Water District (SWD), which is a different water distribution company serving the neighboring towns of Subic, Zambales.). In 2013, the city's shares in Subic Water has been sold to [[Maynilad Water Services|Maynilad Water Services Inc.]] (Maynilad) to continue modernizing the city's water utilities services.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rappler.com/business/24592-olongapo-sells-10-of-subic-water-to-maynilad|title=Olongapo sells 10% of Subic Water to Maynilad|access-date=2016-07-03}}</ref> In March 2016, this was reversed and the city has bought back its shares because the city wanted to have a representation in Subic Water because the city's constituents accounted for the majority of Subic Water's customers.\n\n==Landmarks==\n* '''Ulo ng Apo''': A towering and majestic marker located at the rotonda in Bajac-Bajac.  A very visible and tangible tourist attraction to glorify the legend of the city.\n* '''Olongapo City Hall''': The City Hall is located at Rizal Avenue, West Bajac-Bajac. On the east side contains the PUD (Public Utilities Department), in charge of providing electricity to the city (but is later on replaced by OEDC-Olongapo Electric Distribution company). To the east is the Olongapo City PNP Police Station 1, and at the back of the city hall is the Health Building.\n* '''Olongapo City Convention Center''': More conveniently known as OCCC or OCC, it has been the site of many events in Olongapo City history, not to mention numerous conferences, meetings, and school events.\n* '''Olongapo City Museum''': Opened to the public in 2003, the museum contains dioramas, artifacts, and paintings about the history of the city. At the entrance, a rotating Ulo ng Apo statue meets you.\n* '''Olongapo City Public Library''': The original Library stood near the City Hall. However, to make way for the construction of the PUD office, it was relocated at Hospital Road, East Tapinac; near the Convention Center.\n* '''Olongapo City Public Market''': One of the three Wet and Dry public markets in the city of Olongapo. Pag-Asa Public Market near SM City Olongapo and the Old Market near Olongapo City Hall.\n* '''Marikit Park''': One of the earliest parks of Olongapo, it has become famous in its time. Today, it is near [[Gordon College (Philippines)|Gordon College]], the museum, the convention center and the library.\n* '''Olongapo Lighthouse''': A panoramic view perfect for picture taking. This old lighthouse is located along the national highway going to the north.  It overlooks the Subic Bay Freeport area.\n* '''Kalapati''' ''(The Dove Monument)'': Mr. Kasanobu Miyazaki, a Japanese owner of an accounting firm in [[Aioi City]], Japan, requested that a shrine be built in New Cabalan where his brother, Capt. Masanobu Miyazaki died in battle at the Zig Zag Pass. Mayor Gordon suggested instead a peace monument dedicated to the Filipino, American and Japanese lives that were lost in that battle. The monument was thus built at the junction of the national highway and the road into New Cabalan. It is surmounted by a dove of peace. This monument welcomes travelers who will pass the first barangay of Olongapo City from the province of [[Bataan]].\n* '''[[SM City Olongapo Downtown]]''' ''(formerly Olongapo City Mall)'': The first major mall in the city that is owned by property development firm [[SM Prime|SM Prime Holdings]].

It is a partial remake of their 1931 short film ''[[Beau Hunks]]''.\n\n==Plot==\nWhile the boys are working in the fish market in [[Paris]], Ollie falls in love with Georgette ([[Jean Parker]]), the beautiful daughter of an innkeeper. She turns down his marriage proposal because she is married to a [[French Foreign Legion|Foreign Legion]] officer named Francois ([[Reginald Gardiner]]). Heartbroken, Ollie contemplates [[suicide]]. He is joined by his friend Stan in sinking himself into a river. (In some versions this proceeding is complicated by the presence of an \"escaped shark\".) Stan repeatedly interrupts Ollie as he is about to throw the weight in, and asks him to consider the possibility of [[reincarnation]]. Ollie decides his preference is to be reincarnated as a horse. Francois catches sight of them and convinces them to enlist in the Foreign Legion in order to forget Ollie's failed romance. When Stan asks how long it will take Ollie to forget, Francois says it will only take a matter of a few days.\n\nThe [[commandant]] ([[Charles B. Middleton]]) introduces Ollie and Stan to their daily legionnaire duties, for which their daily wage is 100 centimes, which, translated into American currency amounts to only three cents. Ollie and Stan attempt to negotiate for a higher wage. For this uppity attitude they are sentenced to menial labor, washing and ironing a mountain of laundry, with legion officers constantly on their backs. Finally and 'miraculously', Ollie forgets his broken romance completely. His and Stan's purpose in joining the Foreign Legion fulfilled, they abandon their task, discarding the still hot iron, which unintentionally sets the laundry pile aflame. Angered by the hard work and low pay of the Foreign Legion, Ollie writes the commander an insulting farewell letter and signs it.\n\nThey meet Georgette again. Ollie, delighted that she has seemingly changed her mind and come back to him, proceeds to embrace and kiss her. Francois arrives, informs him that Georgette is his wife and warns him to stay away from her. After Francois leaves, the commandant appears and, having discovered their farewell note and the mountain of burning laundry, pronounces them under arrest for desertion. They are taken to the prison, locked up and sentenced to be shot at dawn. Stan amazes Ollie by playing \"[[The World Is Waiting for the Sunrise]]\" on the bedsprings. As he is about to play another piece, the jailor yells at them to be quiet. Later in the evening, someone throws a note that says they can escape by means of a tunnel leading from their cell to the outside wall. Stan brings on an accidental cave-in which causes the underground path to lead to Francois and Georgette's dwelling. The whole legion engages in hot pursuit of the boys, who flee to a nearby hangar and hide out in an airplane, which Stan accidentally starts up. The boys fly it until it crashes. Stan emerges unharmed from the crash, but Ollie has died, seen ascending into [[Heaven]]. However, Stan later bumps into Ollie, reincarnated as a horse in accordance with the wish he expressed during his aborted suicide attempt. Stan is elated to find his friend alive, but Ollie grumpily remarks, \"Well, here's another nice mess you've gotten me into.\"\n\n==Cast==\nPrincipal credited cast members (in order of on-screen credits) and roles:<ref name= \"credits\">[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0031322/fullcredits \"The Flying Deuces (1939) Full credits.\"] ''imdb.com''.

A remake of ''[[Beau Hunks]]'', ''The Flying Deuces'' was released by [[RKO Radio Pictures]] and was made by independent producer [[Boris Morros]]. Director [[A. Edward Sutherland]] and [[Stan Laurel]] did not get along during filming, with Sutherland having reportedly commented that he \"would rather eat a [[tarantula]] than work with Laurel again\".<ref name=kino/>\n\nAt the beginning of the film, the innkeeper's daughter is seen looking at a framed photograph of Ollie. The same photograph can also be seen in the short film ''[[Our Wife (1931 short)|Our Wife]]'' (1931), where sight of it prompts the father of Ollie's fianc\u00e9 to forbid the wedding.\n\nThe \"laundry scene\" in ''The Flying Deuces'' was filmed on the [[Iverson Movie Ranch]] in the [[Chatsworth, Los Angeles, California|Chatsworth section of Los Angeles, California]], considered to be the most often used outdoor shooting location for films and television shows. In the scene, the characters played by Laurel and Hardy, having disrupted training camp soon after joining the Foreign Legion, are forced to do a massive amount of laundry\u2014seemingly the laundry for the entire Foreign Legion. For the shoot, a facsimile of a huge pile of laundry was built on top of one of the giant sandstone boulders of Iverson's Garden of the Gods, which is now a park.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20171214221133/http://iversonmovieranch.blogspot.com/2014/08/laurel-and-hardy-take-on-iverson-movie.html</ref> Aerial footage of the scene, including a large spread consisting of laundry hanging on lines, was shot for the movie but was not used in it, and later turned up in a number of other productions, including the Republic serials ''[[Manhunt of Mystery Island]]'' (1945) and ''[[Radar Patrol vs. Spy King]]'' (1949), along with the Allied Artists movie ''[[The Cyclops (film)|The Cyclops]]'' (1957).\n\n==Critical reception==\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]], ''The Flying Deuces'' has a score of 83% based on six critic reviews, with an average rating of 6/10.<ref>https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_flying_deuces</ref>\n\n==Public domain==\n[[File:Laurel & Hardy in Flying Deuces 2 edited.png|thumb|Stan and Ollie as \"l\u00e9gionnaires\" in ''The Flying Deuces'']]\n''The Flying Deuces'' is one of two Laurel and Hardy features in the [[public domain]], the other being ''[[Atoll K]]''. As such, it regularly appears on inexpensive DVD or video compilations. Turner/Warner Bros currently possess the original negative, but have not released the film.\n\nWhen the film was originally released, it contained a scene featuring an escaped shark (a strange-looking model fin being pulled back and forth) in the river Stan and Ollie are planning to jump into. This was edited out of some releases of the film.\n\nAn uncut version, transferred from a nitrate 35mm negative discovered in France, was restored by Lobster Films and released by Kino Video in 2004.<ref name=kino>[http://amzn.com/B0002CHIFG Amazon.com, Kino Video]</ref> The [[Legend Films]] edition contains the edited version of the film.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, [[Network Distributing]] released the film on DVD and Blu-ray in 2015. This is the uncut version, as are the 2015 DVD-R and Blu-ray releases by VCI Entertainment in America. Unlike previous home video versions that have generally used a snatch of the opening music during the end titles, these releases include the correct closing music. There is also a German-issued Blu-ray (With the German title \u2018Dick & Doof - In der Fremdenlegion\u2019 on the front cover), released by Edel Germany GmbH in October 2015 that includes Blu-ray 3D and 2D versions of the film on a single disc, and has English and German audio tracks.\n\n==Music==\n* \"[[Shine On, Harvest Moon]]\"\n* \"[[The World Is Waiting for the Sunrise]]\"\n\n==Popular culture==\nIn an episode of ''[[Doctor Who]]'', entitled \"[[The Impossible Astronaut]]\" (2011), [[Amy Pond]] ([[Karen Gillan]]) and [[Rory Williams]] ([[Arthur Darvill]]) watch the movie on DVD.

When Stan asks how long it will take Ollie to forget, Francois says it will only take a matter of a few days.\n\nThe [[commandant]] ([[Charles B. Middleton]]) introduces Ollie and Stan to their daily legionnaire duties, for which their daily wage is 100 centimes, which, translated into American currency amounts to only three cents. Ollie and Stan attempt to negotiate for a higher wage. For this uppity attitude they are sentenced to menial labor, washing and ironing a mountain of laundry, with legion officers constantly on their backs. Finally and 'miraculously', Ollie forgets his broken romance completely. His and Stan's purpose in joining the Foreign Legion fulfilled, they abandon their task, discarding the still hot iron, which unintentionally sets the laundry pile aflame. Angered by the hard work and low pay of the Foreign Legion, Ollie writes the commander an insulting farewell letter and signs it.\n\nThey meet Georgette again. Ollie, delighted that she has seemingly changed her mind and come back to him, proceeds to embrace and kiss her. Francois arrives, informs him that Georgette is his wife and warns him to stay away from her. After Francois leaves, the commandant appears and, having discovered their farewell note and the mountain of burning laundry, pronounces them under arrest for desertion. They are taken to the prison, locked up and sentenced to be shot at dawn. Stan amazes Ollie by playing \"[[The World Is Waiting for the Sunrise]]\" on the bedsprings. As he is about to play another piece, the jailor yells at them to be quiet. Later in the evening, someone throws a note that says they can escape by means of a tunnel leading from their cell to the outside wall. Stan brings on an accidental cave-in which causes the underground path to lead to Francois and Georgette's dwelling. The whole legion engages in hot pursuit of the boys, who flee to a nearby hangar and hide out in an airplane, which Stan accidentally starts up. The boys fly it until it crashes. Stan emerges unharmed from the crash, but Ollie has died, seen ascending into [[Heaven]]. However, Stan later bumps into Ollie, reincarnated as a horse in accordance with the wish he expressed during his aborted suicide attempt. Stan is elated to find his friend alive, but Ollie grumpily remarks, \"Well, here`s another nice mess you`ve gotten me into.\"\n\n==Cast==\nPrincipal credited cast members (in order of on-screen credits) and roles:<ref name= \"credits\">[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0031322/fullcredits \"The Flying Deuces (1939) Full credits.\"] ''imdb.com''.

Middleton]] reprises the Legion Commandant role he played in 1931's ''[[Beau Hunks]]'', while Laurel and Hardy's frequent co-star [[Jimmy Finlayson|James Finlayson]] also makes an appearance as a jailer.\n\n==Production==\nAs Laurel and Hardy did not have an exclusive contract with Hal Roach, they were able to appear in films for studios other than his as they pleased. A remake of ''[[Beau Hunks]]'', ''The Flying Deuces'' was released by [[RKO Radio Pictures]] and was made by independent producer [[Boris Morros]]. Director [[A. Edward Sutherland]] and [[Stan Laurel]] did not get along during filming, with Sutherland having reportedly commented that he \"would rather eat a [[tarantula]] than work with Laurel again\".<ref name=kino/>\n\nAt the beginning of the film, the innkeeper's daughter is seen looking at a framed photograph of Ollie. The same photograph can also be seen in the short film ''[[Our Wife (1931 short)|Our Wife]]'' (1931), where sight of it prompts the father of Ollie's fianc\u00e9 to forbid the wedding.\n\nThe \"laundry scene\" in ''The Flying Deuces'' was filmed on the [[Iverson Movie Ranch]] in the [[Chatsworth, Los Angeles, California|Chatsworth section of Los Angeles, California]], considered to be the most often used outdoor shooting location for films and television shows. In the scene, the characters played by Laurel and Hardy, having disrupted training camp soon after joining the Foreign Legion, are forced to do a massive amount of laundry\u2014seemingly the laundry for the entire Foreign Legion. For the shoot, a facsimile of a huge pile of laundry was built on top of one of the giant sandstone boulders of Iverson's Garden of the Gods, which is now a park.<ref>https://web.archive.org/web/20171214221133/http://iversonmovieranch.blogspot.com/2014/08/laurel-and-hardy-take-on-iverson-movie.html</ref> Aerial footage of the scene, including a large spread consisting of laundry hanging on lines, was shot for the movie but was not used in it, and later turned up in a number of other productions, including the Republic serials ''[[Manhunt of Mystery Island]]'' (1945) and ''[[Radar Patrol vs. Spy King]]'' (1949), along with the Allied Artists movie ''[[The Cyclops (film)|The Cyclops]]'' (1957).\n\n==Critical reception==\nOn [[Rotten Tomatoes]], ''The Flying Deuces'' has a score of 83% based on six critic reviews, with an average rating of 6/10.<ref>https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_flying_deuces</ref>\n\n==Public domain==\n[[File:Laurel & Hardy in Flying Deuces 2 edited.png|thumb|Stan and Ollie as \"l\u00e9gionnaires\" in ''The Flying Deuces'']]\n''The Flying Deuces'' is one of two Laurel and Hardy features in the [[public domain]], the other being ''[[Atoll K]]''. As such, it regularly appears on inexpensive DVD or video compilations. Turner/Warner Bros currently possess the original negative, but have not released the film.\n\nWhen the film was originally released, it contained a scene featuring an escaped shark (a strange-looking model fin being pulled back and forth) in the river Stan and Ollie are planning to jump into. This was edited out of some releases of the film.\n\nAn uncut version, transferred from a nitrate 35mm negative discovered in France, was restored by Lobster Films and released by Kino Video in 2004.<ref name=kino>[http://amzn.com/B0002CHIFG Amazon.com, Kino Video]</ref> The [[Legend Films]] edition contains the edited version of the film.\n\nIn the United Kingdom, [[Network Distributing]] released the film on DVD and Blu-ray in 2015. This is the uncut version, as are the 2015 DVD-R and Blu-ray releases by VCI Entertainment in America. Unlike previous home video versions that have generally used a snatch of the opening music during the end titles, these releases include the correct closing music. There is also a German-issued Blu-ray (With the German title \u2018Dick & Doof - In der Fremdenlegion\u2019 on the front cover), released by Edel Germany GmbH in October 2015 that includes Blu-ray 3D and 2D versions of the film on a single disc, and has English and German audio tracks.\n\n==Music==\n* \"[[Shine On, Harvest Moon]]\"\n* \"[[The World Is Waiting for the Sunrise]]\"\n\n==Popular culture==\nIn an episode of ''[[Doctor Who]]'', entitled \"[[The Impossible Astronaut]]\" (2011), [[Amy Pond]] ([[Karen Gillan]]) and [[Rory Williams]] ([[Arthur Darvill]]) watch the movie on DVD. Rory sees [[Eleventh Doctor|The Doctor]] ([[Matt Smith (actor)|Matt Smith]]) appear in the film, running towards the camera wearing his fez and waving, before returning to dance with Stan and Ollie. This was achieved with Matt Smith dancing in front of a [[green screen]].\n\nThe scene in Georgette's bedroom briefly appears on television in an apartment for elderly people in the movie ''[[Cocoon (film)|Cocoon]]''.\n\nThe image of Stan and Ollie dancing to \"Shine on Harvest Moon\" appears in a 1985 Hershey commercial, \u2018One of the all-time greats\u2019; their suitcases are replaced with images of giant Hershey bars.\n\nThe \"Shine On Harvest Moon\" sequence appears early in the 1987 movie ''[[Dot Goes to Hollywood]]'', with Dot dancing alongside Stan.\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of films in the public domain in the United States]]\n\n==References==\n\n===Notes===\n{{Reflist}}\n\n===Bibliography===\n{{Refbegin}}\n* [[William K.
