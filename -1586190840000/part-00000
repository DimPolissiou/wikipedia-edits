Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face-masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalized hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overwhelmed.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available, if that comes first), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed.

Containment is undertaken in the early stages of the outbreak and aims to trace and isolate those infected as well as introduce other measures of infection control and vaccinations to stop the disease from spreading to the rest of the population. When it is no longer possible to contain the spread of the disease, efforts then move to the mitigation stage: measures are taken to slow the spread and mitigate its effects on the healthcare system and society. A combination of both containment and mitigation measures may be undertaken at the same time.<ref name=\"NY0JD\" /> Suppression requires more extreme measures so as to reverse the pandemic by reducing the [[basic reproduction number]] to less than 1.<ref name=\"ImpCollege16mar2020\" />\n\nPart of managing an infectious disease outbreak is trying to decrease the epidemic peak, known as flattening the epidemic curve.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> This decreases the risk of health services being overwhelmed and provides more time for vaccines and treatments to be developed.<ref name=\"Lancet2020Flatten\" /> Non-pharmaceutical interventions that may manage the outbreak include personal preventive measures, such as hand hygiene, wearing face-masks, and self-quarantine; community measures aimed at physical distancing such as closing schools and cancelling mass gathering events; community engagement to encourage acceptance and participation in such interventions; as well as environmental measures such surface cleaning.<ref name=\"community mitigation\" />\n\nMore drastic actions aimed at containing the outbreak were taken in China once the severity of the outbreak became apparent, such as quarantining entire cities and imposing strict travel bans.<ref name=\"RwmYm\" /> Other countries also adopted a variety of measures aimed at limiting the spread of the virus. South Korea introduced mass screening and localized quarantines, and issued alerts on the movements of infected individuals. Singapore provided financial support for those infected who quarantined themselves and imposed large fines for those who failed to do so. Taiwan increased face mask production and penalized hoarding of medical supplies.<ref name=\"shZdf\" />\n\nSimulations for Great Britain and the United States show that mitigation (slowing but not stopping epidemic spread) and suppression (reversing epidemic growth) have major challenges.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Optimal mitigation policies might reduce peak healthcare demand by 2/3 and deaths by half, but still result in hundreds of thousands of deaths and health systems being overwhelmed.<!--ref name=ImpCollege16mar2020--> Suppression can be preferred but needs to be maintained for as long as the virus is circulating in the human population (or until a vaccine becomes available, if that comes first), as transmission otherwise quickly rebounds when measures are relaxed.

Alas, Hans meets a countryman who informs him that the pig's owner is the squire and he is in danger of being arrested for taking the squire's pig. Hans takes the countryman's goose in exchange for his pig, happy that it will provide a good roast and a supply of goose fat.\n\nAt his next stop in a village Hans meets a scissor-grinder and explains his story to him. The scissor-grinder offers him a grindstone for his goose arguing that a grindstone will provide a source of income. Hans happily exchanges the goose for the grindstone. He continues on his way, but is tired carrying the grindstone and is short of money for food.\n\nHans stops for a drink on the banks of a river, the grindstone falls into the deep water and is lost. Hans is happy to be rid of the heavy grindstone and being free of all troubles. He walks on to his mother's house and recounts his lucky tale.\n\n==Origin==\n\"Hans in Luck\" is a German folk tale recorded by the [[Brothers Grimm]] and published in ''[[Grimm's Fairy Tales]]'' 1812.\n\n==Adaptations==\nThe story has been adapted for an animation film called ''Hans in Luck'' (1978)\n\nIt has also been adapted for the stage by American composer Omari Tau in the one-act opera ''Hans In Luck'' (2011)\n\n==Analysis==\nHans in Luck has been described as an ironic fairy tale which inverts the normal \"rags to riches\" story format.<ref name=\"Tatar\">{{cite book |last=Tatar |first=Maria |authorlink=Maria Tatar |title=The hard facts of the Grimms' fairy tales |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton, N.J. |origyear=1987|year=1991 |pages=100\u2013101 |isbn=978-0-691-01487-6}}</ref> Instead, it can be interpreted as anti-materialistic as Hans trades in his newly won treasures and expresses relief to be freed from the weight to return home happily. It can also be set apart from many other folk and fairy tales as it avoids romantic themes such as damsels and princesses; instead focusing upon maternal love as Hans is returning home to see his mother.\n\n==Motifs==\nThe English fairy tale ''[[The Hedley Kow]]'' contains a similar sequence in which the main character persuades herself that every change is proof of her good luck.\n\n==Notes==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Portal |Children's literature}}\n*{{wikisource-inline}}\n*{{commonscat-inline}}\n\n{{Brothers Grimm}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Hans In Luck}}\n[[Category:Grimms' Fairy Tales]]\n", "name_user": "Ser Amantio di Nicolao", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eExternal links:add authority control", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hans_in_Luck"}

It is currently rated the World's Best Airport by [[Skytrax]]. It is located approximately {{cvt|17.2|km}} from the city's commercial centre, on a {{convert|13|km2|sqmi}} site on the easternmost point of the main island.<ref name=\"AIP\">{{cite web|url=http://www.caas.gov.sg/caasWeb2010/export/sites/caas/en/Regulations/Aeronautical_Information/AIP/aerodrome/AD_WSSS/WSSS-AD2-1.pdf||title=Aerodrome Geographical and Administrative Data|website=Caas.gov.sg|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923195740/http://www.caas.gov.sg/caasWeb2010/export/sites/caas/en/Regulations/Aeronautical_Information/AIP/aerodrome/AD_WSSS/WSSS-AD2-1.pdf|archivedate=23 September 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe infrastructure of Changi Airport includes passenger terminals, runways, taxiways, maintenance buildings and services, and ground support equipment.\n\n==Background==\nGiven limited land resources in Singapore, [[Singapore Changi Airport]] was developed on reclaimed land on the eastern tip of the island. As the country's primary international airport, it was designed for current needs and future expansion to double its passenger's handling. Land can further be reclaimed from the sea for more runways and terminal buildings.\n\nThe master plan initially involved a dual-terminal and dual-runway configuration over two phases with provisions for another two passenger terminals. Phase 1 included the construction for terminal 1, the first runway, 45 aircraft parking bays, support facilities and structures, including a large maintenance hangar, the first fire station, workshops and administrative offices, an airfreight complex, two cargo agents' buildings, in-flight catering kitchens and a {{cvt|80|m}} control tower. Phase II construction commenced immediately after the completion of Phase 1 and include the second runway, 23 additional aircraft parking bays, a second fire station, and a third cargo agents' building.\n\n==Changi Airport Control Tower==\n[[File:Singapore Changi Airport, Control Tower 2, Dec 05.JPG|thumb|left|Changi Control Tower.]]\nThe Air traffic control tower (ATC) was constructed in Phase One, sited in between the first 2 runways and stands at about 81 m Above Mean Sea Level (AMSL). It provides aerodrome control service to aircraft landing, departing and maneuvering within the airport.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.caas.gov.sg/caas/en/About_CAAS/Our_Strategic_Thrusts/Air_Navigation_Services/Our_Facilities/Changi_Control_Tower.html|title= Singapore Changi Control Tower|publisher=Civil Aviation Authority Singapore (CAAS)|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170430223415/https://www.caas.gov.sg/caas/en/About_CAAS/Our_Strategic_Thrusts/Air_Navigation_Services/Our_Facilities/Changi_Control_Tower.html|archivedate=30 April 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Runways==\nChangi Airport has two parallel runways of size {{cvt|4000|by|60|m|0}} each, designated 02L/20R and 02C/20C.<ref name=\"AIP\"/> 02L/20R was completed in 1981 with a [[displaced threshold]] of {{cvt|740|m|0}} leaving the rest of the runway at {{cvt|3260|m|0}} long.<ref name=\"AIP\"/> 02C/20C (formerly named 02R/20L) was built completely on [[Land reclamation|reclaimed land]] and opened with phase&nbsp;2, {{cvt|1.6|km}} to the east of 02L/20R. Four [[instrument landing system]]s (ILS) are installed on the two runways to guide [[landing]] aircraft safely under all weather conditions. Both runways are also used by the [[Republic of Singapore Air Force]] as part of [[Changi Airbase (West)|Changi Airbase]].\n\nA new parallel runway 02R/20L (named 01/19 when it was opened in 2004) was built {{cvt|1.8|km}} to the east of 02C/20C - used only by [[Republic of Singapore Air Force]] as part of [[Changi Air Base (East)|Changi Air Base]]. Originally at a length of 2.75&nbsp;km, it has been lengthened to 4&nbsp;km to handle larger passenger aircraft. Almost 40&nbsp;km of new taxiways were built to connect the runway with the main airport. New facilities such as navigation aids, airfield lighting systems and a fire station were included.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.straitstimes.com/breaking-news/singapore/story/budget-2013-third-runway-changi-airport-2020-20130313 | title=Budget 2013: Third runway for Changi Airport by 2020 | work=The Straits Times| date=13 March 2013 | accessdate=13 March 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.caas.gov.sg/docs/default-source/pdf/20180622-esup-2018-031_singapore-changi-airport---revised-information-and-data-for-runway-02r_20l.pdf |title=SINGAPORE CHANGI AIRPORT \u2013 UPDATED INFORMATION AND DATA FOR RUNWAY 02R/20L |date=22 June 2018 |website=AIP Singapore |publisher=[[Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore]]  }}</ref>\n\n{|class=wikitable\n! colspan=\"14\" style=\"background:lightgrey; color:black; line-height:150%; | Runway Informations, Radio Navigations & Landing Aids<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.caas.gov.sg/caasWeb2010/export/sites/caas/en/Regulations/Aeronautical_Information/AIP/aerodrome/AD_WSSS/WSSS-AD2-18.pdf | title=Singapore Changi Airport (WSSS) Runway Informations, Radio Navigations & Landing Aids | publisher=[[Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore|Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS)]] | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110304184849/https://www.caas.gov.sg/caasWeb2010/export/sites/caas/en/Regulations/Aeronautical_Information/AIP/aerodrome/AD_WSSS/WSSS-AD2-18.pdf | archivedate=4 March 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.caas.gov.sg/caasWeb2010/export/sites/caas/en/Regulations/Aeronautical_Information/AIP/aerodrome/AD_WSSS/WSSS-AD2-14.pdf | title=Singapore Changi Airport (WSSS) Approach and Runway Lighting | publisher=[[Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore|Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS)]] | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160130143259/https://www.caas.gov.sg/caasWeb2010/export/sites/caas/en/Regulations/Aeronautical_Information/AIP/aerodrome/AD_WSSS/WSSS-AD2-14.pdf | archivedate=30 January 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.caas.gov.sg/caasWeb2010/export/sites/caas/en/Regulations/Aeronautical_Information/AIP/aerodrome/AD_WSSS/WSSS-AD2-11.pdf | title=Runway Informations | publisher=[[Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore|Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS)]] | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160131131621/https://www.caas.gov.sg/caasWeb2010/export/sites/caas/en/Regulations/Aeronautical_Information/AIP/aerodrome/AD_WSSS/WSSS-AD2-11.pdf | archivedate=31 January 2016}}</ref>\n|-\n! rowspan=2| [[Runway|Runway Name]] \n! rowspan=2| Runway Direction\n! rowspan=2| Magnetic Heading\n! rowspan=2| Type of Surface\n! colspan=2| Length (m)\n! rowspan=2| Width (m)\n! rowspan=2| [[Instrument landing system|Instrument Landing System]]<br>Name<br>(IDENT)\n! colspan=3| Frequencies (MHz)\n! rowspan=2| ILS categories for precision approach and landing\n! colspan=2| Users\n|-\n!

The [[Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore]] spent [[Singapore dollar|S$]]60 million in upgrading the two existing terminals and airport infrastructure, including enlarged gate hold rooms, new finger piers, and extended baggage belt carousels from the normal {{cvt|70|to|90|m}}. With these new carousels in place, the airport does not expect embarking and disembarking passengers and baggage from the A380 to take longer than it does from a Boeing 747-400, which carries fewer passengers. On 16 August 2005, Changi Airport unveiled the first of 11 specially built gates capable of handling the giant aircraft. Costing S$15 million, the gates or 'fingers' enable passengers to board the upper deck of the new 555-seater aircraft directly from the gate hold rooms. The hold rooms themselves have been enlarged and appointed to cater to the larger number of passengers aboard an A380. Beside the 11 new A380-capable gates at Terminals 1 and 2, eight more A380-capable gates were opened at Terminal 3 on 9 January 2008.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://appserver1.caas.gov.sg/caasmediaweb2010/opencms/Journalist/Press_Releases/2005/news_0010.html?__locale=en&site=caas | archive-url=https://archive.is/20121224191005/http://appserver1.caas.gov.sg/caasmediaweb2010/opencms/Journalist/Press_Releases/2005/news_0010.html?__locale=en&site=caas | url-status=dead | archive-date=24 December 2012 | title=First Gate at Singapore Changi Airport is Ready for Airbus 380 | publisher=Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) | date=16 August 2005 | accessdate=31 October 2012 }}</ref>\n\n==Jewel Changi Airport==\n{{main|Jewel Changi Airport}}\n[[File:Jewel Changi Airport Rain Vortex 4.jpg|left|thumb|Jewel Changi]]\nAnnounced in August 2013, Jewel is a new terminal structure that is intended as a mixed-use complex.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.changiairport.com/corporate/media-centre/newsroom.html#/pressreleases/changi-airport-group-and-capitamalls-asia-to-jointly-develop-project-jewel-at-changi-airport-943581 | title=Changi Airport Group to develop iconic mixed-use complex | publisher=Changi Airport Group | date=19 August 2013| accessdate=19 August 2013}}</ref> It is situated on a 3.5-hectare site where the Terminal 1 car park used to reside. Jewel is a joint venture between Changi Airport (51%) and [[Capitaland|CapitaMalls Asia]] (49%). Essentially, a new multi-storey underground car park of about 2,500 car park spaces replace the existing facilities, while an indoor garden (with a waterfall) is built above. The new building sits between the three existing terminal buildings, enabling passengers to transfer via the new complex, whilst being an attraction and shopping destination in itself. The design consists of a circular structure, reminiscent of a doughnut, with a large garden and located at the centre is the HSBC Rain Vortex. There is also a hotel of about 130 rooms as part of the project.<ref name=\"Jewel\" />\n\nAs part of the project, Terminal 1 is expanded to allow more space for the arrival hall, baggage claim areas and taxi bays.

Terminals&nbsp;1, 2, and 3 are directly connected via a people mover system, with airside passengers being able to freely move between the terminals without going through immigration. Transport within and between these three terminals is also provided by [[people mover]]s and the [[Singapore Changi Airport#Inter-terminal transportation|skytrain system]], although it is also possible to walk between the terminals on foot for airside visitors.\n\nA former Budget Terminal, capable of handling 7&nbsp;million passenger per year, was purpose-built for [[low-cost carrier]]s. It was physically separated from the main terminals towards the south, where connections were possible via a free [[Public transport bus service|shuttle bus]] service to and from Terminal&nbsp;2.

Configured in an H-shaped layout to maximise the number of aerobridges that may be built, it underwent two major upgrading works over its lifespan. A major refurbishment was completed in 1995 at a cost of S$170 million and work to extend two finger piers to add 14 aerobridges at a cost of S$420 million that took place from 1996 to 1999. Today, the terminal spans an area of 308,000 m\u00b2 and can accommodate a maximum passenger capacity of 21 million passengers a year.\n\nOn 7 March 2012, Minister of State for Transport [[Josephine Teo]] said that the open-air car park between Terminal&nbsp;1 and Changi's iconic control tower will be redeveloped into a multi-use complex. This new complex will be integrated with the existing building, and will increase Terminal&nbsp;1's public areas, pick-up driveways, and car park spaces. With this expansion, Terminal&nbsp;1's handling capacity will increase from 21 to 24&nbsp;million passengers per annum.

The name of the Budget Terminal was decided as a result of a naming contest open to the public. However, the terminal is not included in the numbering scheme, even though it is the third passenger terminal to be opened when it opened on 26 March 2006; and Terminal 3 is actually the fifth terminal to be opened at the airport (with the fourth being the cargo terminal).\n\nTo offer lower [[landing fee]]s, handling fees and [[Airport Improvement Fee|airport taxes]], it cuts back on amenities such as aerobridges, elaborate physical structures and decorations in the passenger terminal building. There is no transfer facility at the Budget Terminal.\n\nIn September 2008, expansion works costing $10&nbsp;million began and took seven months to complete. The terminal was then able to handle seven million passengers a year, up from originally 2.7&nbsp;million. There are more boarding gates, check-in counters, shops, and dining options. In addition, air-conditioning has been installed for arriving passengers.\n\nOn 2 March 2012, it was announced that the Budget Terminal would be closed on 25 September 2012 and demolished to make way for Terminal 4. All airlines previously operating from the Budget Terminal moved to Terminal 2, after the last flight departed Budget Terminal at 2&nbsp;am on 25 September. Construction of Terminal 4 began in 2013 and was completed on 31 October 2017. It will have a capacity for 16 million passengers per annum, up from the previous 7 million of the Budget Terminal, and will have aerobridges. It also promises to have a wider choice of retail and food and beverage offerings compared to the current Budget Terminal. Terminal 4 will be designed to enable efficient passenger processing and quick turnaround of aircraft. That is because once the ASEAN Open Skies agreement is in place by 2011, passenger traffic will likely grow by at least five percent each year.\n\n=== JetQuay CIP Terminal ===\nJetQuay CIP Terminal, is a privately run terminal, located in between T2 and the VIP terminal. JetQuay provides private check-in, baggage handling, and immigration clearance services. It is the second luxury airport terminal in world to open after the Lufthansa First Class Terminal in [[Frankfurt Airport]]. However, unlike the Lufthansa First Class Terminal, JetQuay is an elite, dedicated CIP (Commercially Important People) terminal that can be used by any passenger travelling in any class, on any airline, through any terminal (T1, T2, T3, or T4).{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\n=== Terminal 3 ===\n[[File:SINT3.JPG|thumb|left|Transit area of Terminal 3.]]\n[[File:Changi Airport Terminal 3 butterfly garden.JPG|thumb|The Butterfly Garden in Terminal 3.]]\n[[File:T3TransitArea.JPG|thumb|Shops line along the transit area in Terminal 3.]]\nTerminal 3, the airport's fourth passenger terminal, became operational on 9 January 2008,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dfnionline.com/article/Changi-T3-opens-for-business-1851956.html |title=Singapore Changi Terminal&nbsp;3 Opens |publisher=Dfnionline.com |accessdate=8 November 2011}}</ref> increasing the airport's annual passenger capacity by 22&nbsp;million.

Like other new airports in the region, it has a structure mainly made of glass, with big transparent spaces inside the terminal. However, unlike these newer airports, it incorporates \"natural\" features and \"warm\" tone extensively to balance the sterile feel of glass and steel. For example, the column is given a wood-like cladding and the floor of the terminal is mostly cream/ beige colour. The roof has been designed to allow natural light to enter the building, with 919 [[Window#Skylight|skylights]].

[[Swissair]]'s [[Swissport]] won the 10-year licence and commenced operations on 2 March 2005.<ref>{{cite web| url= http://www.swissport.com/mediacenter/index_news.php?id=206&ref=archive| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090415005215/http://www.swissport.com/mediacenter/index_news.php?id=206&ref=archive| archivedate= 15 April 2009| title= Swissport handles its first flight in Singapore \u2013 four months earlier than planned| accessdate=20 January 2008| date= 2 March 2005| work= News Releases| publisher= Swissport International| quote= 2 March 2005 \u2013 Swissport commenced its operations at Singapore's Changi Airport today, becoming the airport's third ground handling provider; Swissport's new licence at Changi is valid for ten years and covers passenger, baggage and cargo handling services.}}</ref>\n\nAs Swissair folded and was subsequently taken over by [[Swiss International Air Lines]], the latter became the company's first customer. [[Adam Air]] chose Swissport as its ground handler in 2005, while Tiger Airways followed suit in 2006. Other customers of Swissport include [[Swiss World Cargo]], [[AirAsia]], and [[Cardig Air]]. Former customers of Swissport include [[Australian Airlines]]. Swissport ceased operation on 31 March 2009 due to massive losses.\n\nIn 2009, a wholly owned subsidiary of SATS, Asia Pacific Star (APS) began operating.<ref>{{cite web|title=SATS LAUNCHES LOW-COST GROUND HANDLING UNIT|url=https://www.sats.com.sg/Media/NewsContent/PR-10_Mar09.pdf|website=www.sats.com.sg|accessdate=10 March 2009}}</ref> It concentrates mainly on budget carriers by providing point-to-point ground handling services such as passenger, ramp and baggage handling, and aircraft interior cleaning with short turnaround times.

It is currently rated the World's Best Airport by [[Skytrax]]. It is located approximately {{cvt|17.2|km}} from the city's commercial centre, on a {{convert|13|km2|sqmi}} site on the easternmost point of the main island.<ref name=\"AIP\">{{cite web|url=http://www.caas.gov.sg/caasWeb2010/export/sites/caas/en/Regulations/Aeronautical_Information/AIP/aerodrome/AD_WSSS/WSSS-AD2-1.pdf||title=Aerodrome Geographical and Administrative Data|website=Caas.gov.sg|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150923195740/http://www.caas.gov.sg/caasWeb2010/export/sites/caas/en/Regulations/Aeronautical_Information/AIP/aerodrome/AD_WSSS/WSSS-AD2-1.pdf|archivedate=23 September 2015}}</ref>\n\nThe infrastructure of Changi Airport includes passenger terminals, runways, taxiways, maintenance buildings and services, and ground support equipment.\n\n==Background==\nGiven limited land resources in Singapore, [[Singapore Changi Airport]] was developed on reclaimed land on the eastern tip of the island. As the country's primary international airport, it was designed for current needs and future expansion to double its passenger's handling. Land can further be reclaimed from the sea for more runways and terminal buildings.\n\nThe master plan initially involved a dual-terminal and dual-runway configuration over two phases with provisions for another two passenger terminals. Phase 1 included the construction for terminal 1, the first runway, 45 aircraft parking bays, support facilities and structures, including a large maintenance hangar, the first fire station, workshops and administrative offices, an airfreight complex, two cargo agents' buildings, in-flight catering kitchens and a {{cvt|80|m}} control tower. Phase II construction commenced immediately after the completion of Phase 1 and include the second runway, 23 additional aircraft parking bays, a second fire station, and a third cargo agents' building.\n\n==Changi Airport Control Tower==\n[[File:Singapore Changi Airport, Control Tower 2, Dec 05.JPG|thumb|left|Changi Control Tower.]]\nThe Air traffic control tower (ATC) was constructed in Phase One, sited in between the first 2 runways and stands at about 81 m Above Mean Sea Level (AMSL). It provides aerodrome control service to aircraft landing, departing and maneuvering within the airport.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.caas.gov.sg/caas/en/About_CAAS/Our_Strategic_Thrusts/Air_Navigation_Services/Our_Facilities/Changi_Control_Tower.html|title= Singapore Changi Control Tower|publisher=Civil Aviation Authority Singapore (CAAS)|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170430223415/https://www.caas.gov.sg/caas/en/About_CAAS/Our_Strategic_Thrusts/Air_Navigation_Services/Our_Facilities/Changi_Control_Tower.html|archivedate=30 April 2017}}</ref>\n\n==Runways==\nChangi Airport has two parallel runways of size {{cvt|4000|by|60|m|0}} each, designated 02L/20R and 02C/20C.<ref name=\"AIP\"/> 02L/20R was completed in 1981 with a [[displaced threshold]] of {{cvt|740|m|0}} leaving the rest of the runway at {{cvt|3260|m|0}} long.<ref name=\"AIP\"/> 02C/20C (formerly named 02R/20L) was built completely on [[Land reclamation|reclaimed land]] and opened with phase&nbsp;2, {{cvt|1.6|km}} to the east of 02L/20R. Four [[instrument landing system]]s (ILS) are installed on the two runways to guide [[landing]] aircraft safely under all weather conditions. Both runways are also used by the [[Republic of Singapore Air Force]] as part of [[Changi Airbase (West)|Changi Airbase]].\n\nA new parallel runway 02R/20L (named 01/19 when it was opened in 2004) was built {{cvt|1.8|km}} to the east of 02C/20C - used only by [[Republic of Singapore Air Force]] as part of [[Changi Air Base (East)|Changi Air Base]]. Originally at a length of 2.75&nbsp;km, it has been lengthened to 4&nbsp;km to handle larger passenger aircraft. Almost 40&nbsp;km of new taxiways were built to connect the runway with the main airport. New facilities such as navigation aids, airfield lighting systems and a fire station were included.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.straitstimes.com/breaking-news/singapore/story/budget-2013-third-runway-changi-airport-2020-20130313 | title=Budget 2013: Third runway for Changi Airport by 2020 | work=The Straits Times| date=13 March 2013 | accessdate=13 March 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.caas.gov.sg/docs/default-source/pdf/20180622-esup-2018-031_singapore-changi-airport---revised-information-and-data-for-runway-02r_20l.pdf |title=SINGAPORE CHANGI AIRPORT \u2013 UPDATED INFORMATION AND DATA FOR RUNWAY 02R/20L |date=22 June 2018 |website=AIP Singapore |publisher=[[Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore]]  }}</ref>\n\n{|class=wikitable\n! colspan=\"14\" style=\"background:lightgrey; color:black; line-height:150%; | Runway Informations, Radio Navigations & Landing Aids<ref>{{cite web | url=https://www.caas.gov.sg/caasWeb2010/export/sites/caas/en/Regulations/Aeronautical_Information/AIP/aerodrome/AD_WSSS/WSSS-AD2-18.pdf | title=Singapore Changi Airport (WSSS) Runway Informations, Radio Navigations & Landing Aids | publisher=[[Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore|Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS)]] | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110304184849/https://www.caas.gov.sg/caasWeb2010/export/sites/caas/en/Regulations/Aeronautical_Information/AIP/aerodrome/AD_WSSS/WSSS-AD2-18.pdf | archivedate=4 March 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.caas.gov.sg/caasWeb2010/export/sites/caas/en/Regulations/Aeronautical_Information/AIP/aerodrome/AD_WSSS/WSSS-AD2-14.pdf | title=Singapore Changi Airport (WSSS) Approach and Runway Lighting | publisher=[[Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore|Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS)]] | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160130143259/https://www.caas.gov.sg/caasWeb2010/export/sites/caas/en/Regulations/Aeronautical_Information/AIP/aerodrome/AD_WSSS/WSSS-AD2-14.pdf | archivedate=30 January 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.caas.gov.sg/caasWeb2010/export/sites/caas/en/Regulations/Aeronautical_Information/AIP/aerodrome/AD_WSSS/WSSS-AD2-11.pdf | title=Runway Informations | publisher=[[Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore|Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS)]] | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160131131621/https://www.caas.gov.sg/caasWeb2010/export/sites/caas/en/Regulations/Aeronautical_Information/AIP/aerodrome/AD_WSSS/WSSS-AD2-11.pdf | archivedate=31 January 2016}}</ref>\n|-\n! rowspan=2| [[Runway|Runway Name]] \n! rowspan=2| Runway Direction\n! rowspan=2| Magnetic Heading\n! rowspan=2| Type of Surface\n! colspan=2| Length (m)\n! rowspan=2| Width (m)\n! rowspan=2| [[Instrument landing system|Instrument Landing System]]<br>Name<br>(IDENT)\n! colspan=3| Frequencies (MHz)\n! rowspan=2| ILS categories for precision approach and landing\n! colspan=2| Users\n|-\n!

The [[Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore]] spent [[Singapore dollar|S$]]60 million in upgrading the two existing terminals and airport infrastructure, including enlarged gate hold rooms, new finger piers, and extended baggage belt carousels from the normal {{cvt|70|to|90|m}}. With these new carousels in place, the airport does not expect embarking and disembarking passengers and baggage from the A380 to take longer than it does from a Boeing 747-400, which carries fewer passengers. On 16 August 2005, Changi Airport unveiled the first of 11 specially built gates capable of handling the giant aircraft. Costing S$15 million, the gates or 'fingers' enable passengers to board the upper deck of the new 555-seater aircraft directly from the gate hold rooms. The hold rooms themselves have been enlarged and appointed to cater to the larger number of passengers aboard an A380. Beside the 11 new A380-capable gates at Terminals 1 and 2, eight more A380-capable gates were opened at Terminal 3 on 9 January 2008.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://appserver1.caas.gov.sg/caasmediaweb2010/opencms/Journalist/Press_Releases/2005/news_0010.html?__locale=en&site=caas | archive-url=https://archive.is/20121224191005/http://appserver1.caas.gov.sg/caasmediaweb2010/opencms/Journalist/Press_Releases/2005/news_0010.html?__locale=en&site=caas | url-status=dead | archive-date=24 December 2012 | title=First Gate at Singapore Changi Airport is Ready for Airbus 380 | publisher=Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS) | date=16 August 2005 | accessdate=31 October 2012 }}</ref>\n\n==Jewel Changi Airport==\n{{main|Jewel Changi Airport}}\n[[File:Jewel Changi Airport Rain Vortex 4.jpg|left|thumb|Jewel Changi]]\nAnnounced in August 2013, Jewel is a new terminal structure that is intended as a mixed-use complex.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.changiairport.com/corporate/media-centre/newsroom.html#/pressreleases/changi-airport-group-and-capitamalls-asia-to-jointly-develop-project-jewel-at-changi-airport-943581 | title=Changi Airport Group to develop iconic mixed-use complex | publisher=Changi Airport Group | date=19 August 2013| accessdate=19 August 2013}}</ref> It is situated on a 3.5-hectare site where the Terminal 1 car park used to reside. Jewel is a joint venture between Changi Airport (51%) and [[Capitaland|CapitaMalls Asia]] (49%). Essentially, a new multi-storey underground car park of about 2,500 car park spaces replace the existing facilities, while an indoor garden (with a waterfall) is built above. The new building sits between the three existing terminal buildings, enabling passengers to transfer via the new complex, whilst being an attraction and shopping destination in itself. The design consists of a circular structure, reminiscent of a doughnut, with a large garden and located at the centre is the HSBC Rain Vortex. There is also a hotel of about 130 rooms as part of the project.<ref name=\"Jewel\" />\n\nAs part of the project, Terminal 1 is expanded to allow more space for the arrival hall, baggage claim areas and taxi bays.

Terminals&nbsp;1, 2, and 3 are directly connected via a people mover system, with airside passengers being able to freely move between the terminals without going through immigration. Transport within and between these three terminals is also provided by [[people mover]]s and the [[Singapore Changi Airport#Inter-terminal transportation|skytrain system]], although it is also possible to walk between the terminals on foot for airside visitors.\n\nA former Budget Terminal, capable of handling 7&nbsp;million passenger per year, was purpose-built for [[low-cost carrier]]s. It was physically separated from the main terminals towards the south, where connections were possible via a free [[Public transport bus service|shuttle bus]] service to and from Terminal&nbsp;2.

Configured in an H-shaped layout to maximise the number of aerobridges that may be built, it underwent two major upgrading works over its lifespan. A major refurbishment was completed in 1995 at a cost of S$170 million and work to extend two finger piers to add 14 aerobridges at a cost of S$420 million that took place from 1996 to 1999. Today, the terminal spans an area of 308,000 m\u00b2 and can accommodate a maximum passenger capacity of 21 million passengers a year.\n\nOn 7 March 2012, Minister of State for Transport [[Josephine Teo]] said that the open-air car park between Terminal&nbsp;1 and Changi's iconic control tower will be redeveloped into a multi-use complex. This new complex will be integrated with the existing building, and will increase Terminal&nbsp;1's public areas, pick-up driveways, and car park spaces. With this expansion, Terminal&nbsp;1's handling capacity will increase from 21 to 24&nbsp;million passengers per annum.

The name of the Budget Terminal was decided as a result of a naming contest open to the public. However, the terminal is not included in the numbering scheme, even though it is the third passenger terminal to be opened when it opened on 26 March 2006; and Terminal 3 is actually the fifth terminal to be opened at the airport (with the fourth being the cargo terminal).\n\nTo offer lower [[landing fee]]s, handling fees and [[Airport Improvement Fee|airport taxes]], it cuts back on amenities such as aerobridges, elaborate physical structures and decorations in the passenger terminal building. There is no transfer facility at the Budget Terminal.\n\nIn September 2008, expansion works costing $10&nbsp;million began and took seven months to complete. The terminal was then able to handle seven million passengers a year, up from originally 2.7&nbsp;million. There are more boarding gates, check-in counters, shops, and dining options. In addition, air-conditioning has been installed for arriving passengers.\n\nOn 2 March 2012, it was announced that the Budget Terminal would be closed on 25 September 2012 and demolished to make way for Terminal 4. All airlines previously operating from the Budget Terminal moved to Terminal 2, after the last flight departed Budget Terminal at 2&nbsp;am on 25 September. Construction of Terminal 4 began in 2013 and was completed on 31 October 2017. It will have a capacity for 16 million passengers per annum, up from the previous 7 million of the Budget Terminal, and will have aerobridges. It also promises to have a wider choice of retail and food and beverage offerings compared to the current Budget Terminal. Terminal 4 will be designed to enable efficient passenger processing and quick turnaround of aircraft. That is because once the ASEAN Open Skies agreement is in place by 2011, passenger traffic will likely grow by at least five percent each year.\n\n=== JetQuay CIP Terminal ===\nJetQuay CIP Terminal, is a privately run terminal, located in between T2 and the VIP terminal. JetQuay provides private check-in, baggage handling, and immigration clearance services. It is the second luxury airport terminal in world to open after the Lufthansa First Class Terminal in [[Frankfurt Airport]]. However, unlike the Lufthansa First Class Terminal, JetQuay is an elite, dedicated CIP (Commercially Important People) terminal that can be used by any passenger travelling in any class, on any airline, through any terminal (T1, T2, T3, or T4).{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}\n\n=== Terminal 3 ===\n[[File:SINT3.JPG|thumb|left|Transit area of Terminal 3.]]\n[[File:Changi Airport Terminal 3 butterfly garden.JPG|thumb|The Butterfly Garden in Terminal 3.]]\n[[File:T3TransitArea.JPG|thumb|Shops line along the transit area in Terminal 3.]]\nTerminal 3, the airport's fourth passenger terminal, became operational on 9 January 2008,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dfnionline.com/article/Changi-T3-opens-for-business-1851956.html |title=Singapore Changi Terminal&nbsp;3 Opens |publisher=Dfnionline.com |accessdate=8 November 2011}}</ref> increasing the airport's annual passenger capacity by 22&nbsp;million.

Like other new airports in the region, it has a structure mainly made of glass, with big transparent spaces inside the terminal.

For example, the column is given a wood-like cladding and the floor of the terminal is mostly cream/ beige colour. The roof has been designed to allow natural light to enter the building, with 919 [[Window#Skylight|skylights]]. A {{cvt|5|m}}-high \"Green Wall\" with hanging creepers and waterfall was incorporated to enhance the tropical feel.
