In this episode, Emma tries to discover her destiny; and Regina is tied up. While Prince Charming tries to escape from The Evil Queen and reunite with Snow White.\n\nIt was co-written by [[Edward Kitsis]] and [[Adam Horowitz (screenwriter)|Adam Horowitz]], while [[Dean White (director)|Dean White]] served as director.\n\n==Plot==\n===Opening sequence===\nThe Dark Curse rumbles through the forest.\n\n===In the characters' past===\nIn the Enchanted Forest, as [[David Nolan (Once Upon a Time)|Prince Charming]] ([[Joshua Dallas|Josh Dallas]]) attempts to escape from the [[Regina Mills|Evil Queen]]'s ([[Lana Parrilla]]) palace, he finds himself outnumbered by her guards. Just as it seems he will be recaptured, the Huntsman ([[Jamie Dornan]]) comes to his aid and kills the guards with his arrows, allowing Charming to escape and continue on his quest to find [[Mary Margaret Blanchard|Snow White]] ([[Ginnifer Goodwin]]).  En route, Charming is transported to an infinite forest, thanks to the Queen and her mirror. [[Mr. Gold|Rumpelstiltskin]] ([[Robert Carlyle]]) appears and offers to help him but Charming refuses. They fight with swords; Rumpelstiltskin toys with him and soon disarms him.  Charming notices his mother's wedding ring is missing. Rumpelstiltskin holds it up and he offers Charming a deal: he will give the prince back his mother's wedding ring, now enchanted to lead him straight to Snow White, if Charming will put a golden egg containing a potion of true love inside \"the belly of the beast.\"\n \nOn his search for the beast, Prince Charming enters a castle and finds [[List of Once Upon a Time characters#Maleficent|Maleficent]] ([[Kristin Bauer van Straten]]), seated on a throne. She turns into a dragon \u2013 the beast \u2013 to attack Charming. He throws the egg into Maleficent's gills and, after he escapes, Rumpelstiltskin returns the ring and magically dresses him in a new set of clothes with which to make his grand return to his true love. As seen in the series premiere, Charming races to Snow White's glass coffin, opens it and kisses her, waking her up. He proposes and she accepts. Together, they begin planning to take back the kingdom from the Evil Queen and Charming's sinister father, [[List of Once Upon a Time characters#King George|King George]].\n\n===In Storybrooke===\nHenry ([[Jared S. Gilmore]]) has collapsed after eating the poisoned apple turnover intended for [[Emma Swan]] ([[Jennifer Morrison]]). She rushes him to the hospital. [[List of Once Upon a Time characters#Victor Frankenstein|Dr. Whale]] ([[David Anders]]) asks Emma if the child has eaten anything or if anything untoward has happened. She shows the doctor the turnover but he dismisses any idea of poison because Henry is not showing any symptoms. Almost immediately, Emma begins to suspect magic as the cause. She looks at the Once Upon a Time book, which magically shows her flashbacks of her birth and the night the curse began. It is only now that she finally believes. As Regina (Parrilla) enters the room to see Henry, Emma violently confronts her. A stunned and guilty Regina blurts out that the turnover was indeed meant for her and that the curse is real. The only one who may be able to help them save Henry is Mr. Gold (Carlyle) who is, in fact, Rumpelstiltskin. The two visit Mr. Gold, who now knows that Emma believes in the curse. He tells them that true love has the ability to break any curse and that, as a safeguard, he had imbued the curse's parchment with a drop of that potion made from Snow White and Prince Charming's love. Since Emma is also a product of Snow White and Prince Charming, she is the only one who can end the curse once and for all. Emma will have to retrieve the rest of the potion from its hiding-place in the belly of a beast. He presents her with her father's sword as a weapon against the beast. As to the potion, it is with Regina's oldest and ''only'' friend.\n \nElsewhere, David Nolan (Dallas) meets Mary Margaret Blanchard (Goodwin) and tells her that ever since he awoke from the coma, the only thing that has ever made sense to him was her. He goes on to say that he plans on leaving town and moving to [[Boston]] unless Mary Margaret gives him a reason to stay. Mary Margaret, moved by his words, still cannot bring herself to take him back and leaves.\n \nBefore Emma goes on her quest, she returns to the hospital where she apologizes to the unconscious Henry for not believing him. She then goes to [[List of Once Upon a Time characters#Pinocchio|August Booth]] ([[Eion Bailey]]) in an attempt to enlist his help and finds him lying in bed. Now that she believes, she can at last perceive August's body becoming wooden. There is just enough time for her to hear his last words of encouragement before he reverts to puppet form. At the hospital, Regina also apologizes to Henry but is interrupted by [[List of Once Upon a Time characters#Jefferson|Jefferson]] ([[Sebastian Stan]]), who has come to demand the completion of the deal made with Regina to reunite him and his daughter. Regina refuses, on the spurious grounds that Emma had not eaten the turnover as planned. As Regina leaves to join Emma, Jefferson sneaks into the hospital\u2019s underground asylum to release [[Belle (Disney)|Belle]] ([[Emilie de Ravin]]), instructing her to find Mr. Gold and enlighten him about Regina's doings.\n \nRegina takes Emma to a secret room inside the boarded-up Storybrooke Public Library clock tower. The room contains an elevator, but only one person can go down while the other operates it. Despite her hatred and mistrust for Regina, Emma decides she will descend while Regina stays above ground. As Emma arrives to the bottom, she sees Snow White's glass coffin, then finds herself face-to-face with Maleficent in dragon form. Emma starts fighting with the dragon, but discards the sword and instead fires her gun repeatedly at the beast. She soon realizes that the sword is the only way to kill the dragon. She retrieves the sword and hurls it at the dragon, causing it to explode and release the golden egg containing the love potion.\n \nMeanwhile, Mary Margaret is reading Henry's storybook to him in his hospital bed. As she reads he begins to flat-line.\n \nAs Emma ascends in the elevator, it suddenly stops working.  She hears Mr. Gold by the controls above her. He tells her that Regina has abandoned her then suggests that Emma should throw the egg up to him and he will wait for her as she climbs up. She complies. When Emma reaches the surface, Gold is nowhere to be found. Regina is tied up and gagged. Emma rescues her, and as they go after Gold, they simultaneously receive calls from the hospital regarding Henry. \n\nWhen they arrive, they learn that he has died and both grieve. A devastated Emma goes to Henry's body, whispers to him that she loves him and kisses him on the forehead. This act is seen as \"true love's kiss:\", therefore the pure love shockwave occurs. Emma has broken the curse, bringing Henry back to life and causes everyone in Storybrooke to regain their memories. The [[List of Once Upon a Time characters#Blue Fairy|Blue Fairy]] ([[Keegan Connor Tracy]]) suggests to Regina that she had best find somewhere to hide as everyone she has wronged will want revenge. Regina runs away, but not before telling a silently-watching Henry that she truly does love him. She returns to her mansion, lamenting her defeat and the loss of the only person she loves.\n \nRegaining his memories, David returns to town and finds Mary Margaret, calling out \"Snow!\" She responds by calling him Charming, confirming that they both remember. They embrace and rejoice in the fact that they have found each other again. Elsewhere around town, other Storybrooke residents are hit by the pure love shockwave, and they remember their fairytale past including [[List of Once Upon a Time characters#Ruby|Ruby]] ([[Little Red Riding Hood|Red Riding Hood]]), [[List of Once Upon a Time characters#Widow Lucas|Granny]], and [[List of Once Upon a Time characters#Jiminy Cricket|Archie Hopper]] ([[Jiminy Cricket]]).\n \nBack at the pawn shop, Gold is preparing an as-yet-unknown plan involving the potion, when [[Belle French|Belle]] enters to tell him about what Regina had done to her. Gold is shocked to see Belle still alive and overjoyed to have her back. He sets off for the woods to launch his plan and takes her with him. On their way, the curse is broken and Belle regains her memories, declaring her love for Gold. He tells Belle they will have all the time in the world, but now, they must continue with the plan.\n\nThey walk further and reach the wishing well in the woods. Gold tells Belle that the waters that run beneath it have the power to return what one has lost. He drops the love potion into the wishing well, which causes massive amounts of purple smoke to spew out of the well and spread around them. When Belle asks what is happening, Gold tells her that he is bringing the magic that they had once lost back to their world. When asked why, he tells her that magic is power. The purple smoke spreads quickly and engulfs everything (and everyone) in town. Regina watches from her mansion and deviously smiles, knowing that she will once again regain her magical powers.\n\nThe last scene shows Prince Charming and Snow White standing in the street holding each other as the purple smoke engulfs them and the clock tower.

In this episode, Emma tries to discover her destiny; and Regina is tied up. While Prince Charming tries to escape from The Evil Queen and reunite with Snow White.\n\nIt was co-written by [[Edward Kitsis]] and [[Adam Horowitz (screenwriter)|Adam Horowitz]], while [[Dean White (director)|Dean White]] served as director.\n\n==Plot==\n===Opening sequence===\nThe Dark Curse rumbles through the forest.\n\n===In the characters' past===\nIn the Enchanted Forest, as [[David Nolan (Once Upon a Time)|Prince Charming]] ([[Joshua Dallas|Josh Dallas]]) attempts to escape from the [[Regina Mills|Evil Queen]]'s ([[Lana Parrilla]]) palace, he finds himself outnumbered by her guards. Just as it seems he will be recaptured, the Huntsman ([[Jamie Dornan]]) comes to his aid and kills the guards with his arrows, allowing Charming to escape and continue on his quest to find [[Mary Margaret Blanchard|Snow White]] ([[Ginnifer Goodwin]]).  En route, Charming is transported to an infinite forest, thanks to the Queen and her mirror. [[Mr. Gold|Rumpelstiltskin]] ([[Robert Carlyle]]) appears and offers to help him but Charming refuses. They fight with swords; Rumpelstiltskin toys with him and soon disarms him.  Charming notices his mother's wedding ring is missing. Rumpelstiltskin holds it up and he offers Charming a deal: he will give the prince back his mother's wedding ring, now enchanted to lead him straight to Snow White, if Charming will put a golden egg containing a potion of true love inside \"the belly of the beast.\"\n \nOn his search for the beast, Prince Charming enters a castle and finds [[List of Once Upon a Time characters#Maleficent|Maleficent]] ([[Kristin Bauer van Straten]]), seated on a throne. She turns into a dragon \u2013 the beast \u2013 to attack Charming. He throws the egg into Maleficent's gills and, after he escapes, Rumpelstiltskin returns the ring and magically dresses him in a new set of clothes with which to make his grand return to his true love. As seen in the series premiere, Charming races to Snow White's glass coffin, opens it and kisses her, waking her up. He proposes and she accepts. Together, they begin planning to take back the kingdom from the Evil Queen and Charming's sinister father, [[List of Once Upon a Time characters#King George|King George]].\n\n===In Storybrooke===\nHenry ([[Jared S. Gilmore]]) has collapsed after eating the poisoned apple turnover intended for [[Emma Swan]] ([[Jennifer Morrison]]). She rushes him to the hospital. [[List of Once Upon a Time characters#Victor Frankenstein|Dr. Whale]] ([[David Anders]]) asks Emma if the child has eaten anything or if anything untoward has happened. She shows the doctor the turnover but he dismisses any idea of poison because Henry is not showing any symptoms. Almost immediately, Emma begins to suspect magic as the cause. She looks at the Once Upon a Time book, which magically shows her flashbacks of her birth and the night the curse began. It is only now that she finally believes. As Regina (Parrilla) enters the room to see Henry, Emma violently confronts her. A stunned and guilty Regina blurts out that the turnover was indeed meant for her and that the curse is real. The only one who may be able to help them save Henry is Mr. Gold (Carlyle) who is, in fact, Rumpelstiltskin. The two visit Mr. Gold, who now knows that Emma believes in the curse. He tells them that true love has the ability to break any curse and that, as a safeguard, he had imbued the curse's parchment with a drop of that potion made from Snow White and Prince Charming's love. Since Emma is also a product of Snow White and Prince Charming, she is the only one who can end the curse once and for all. Emma will have to retrieve the rest of the potion from its hiding-place in the belly of a beast. He presents her with her father's sword as a weapon against the beast. As to the potion, it is with Regina's oldest and ''only'' friend.\n \nElsewhere, David Nolan (Dallas) meets Mary Margaret Blanchard (Goodwin) and tells her that ever since he awoke from the coma, the only thing that has ever made sense to him was her. He goes on to say that he plans on leaving town and moving to [[Boston]] unless Mary Margaret gives him a reason to stay. Mary Margaret, moved by his words, still cannot bring herself to take him back and leaves.\n \nBefore Emma goes on her quest, she returns to the hospital where she apologizes to the unconscious Henry for not believing him. She then goes to [[List of Once Upon a Time characters#Pinocchio|August Booth]] ([[Eion Bailey]]) in an attempt to enlist his help and finds him lying in bed. Now that she believes, she can at last perceive August's body becoming wooden. There is just enough time for her to hear his last words of encouragement before he reverts to puppet form. At the hospital, Regina also apologizes to Henry but is interrupted by [[List of Once Upon a Time characters#Jefferson|Jefferson]] ([[Sebastian Stan]]), who has come to demand the completion of the deal made with Regina to reunite him and his daughter. Regina refuses, on the spurious grounds that Emma had not eaten the turnover as planned. As Regina leaves to join Emma, Jefferson sneaks into the hospital\u2019s underground asylum to release [[Belle (Disney)|Belle]] ([[Emilie de Ravin]]), instructing her to find Mr. Gold and enlighten him about Regina's doings.\n \nRegina takes Emma to a secret room inside the boarded-up Storybrooke Public Library clock tower. The room contains an elevator, but only one person can go down while the other operates it. Despite her hatred and mistrust for Regina, Emma decides she will descend while Regina stays above ground. As Emma arrives to the bottom, she sees Snow White's glass coffin, then finds herself face-to-face with Maleficent in dragon form. Emma starts fighting with the dragon, but discards the sword and instead fires her gun repeatedly at the beast. She soon realizes that the sword is the only way to kill the dragon. She retrieves the sword and hurls it at the dragon, causing it to explode and release the golden egg containing the love potion.\n \nMeanwhile, Mary Margaret is reading Henry's storybook to him in his hospital bed. As she reads he begins to flat-line.\n \nAs Emma ascends in the elevator, it suddenly stops working.  She hears Mr. Gold by the controls above her. He tells her that Regina has abandoned her then suggests that Emma should throw the egg up to him and he will wait for her as she climbs up. She complies. When Emma reaches the surface, Gold is nowhere to be found. Regina is tied up and gagged. Emma rescues her, and as they go after Gold, they simultaneously receive calls from the hospital regarding Henry. \n\nWhen they arrive, they learn that he has died and both grieve. A devastated Emma goes to Henry's body, whispers to him that she loves him and kisses him on the forehead. This act is seen as \"true love's kiss:\", therefore the pure love shockwave occurs. Emma has broken the curse, bringing Henry back to life and causes everyone in Storybrooke to regain their memories. The [[List of Once Upon a Time characters#Blue Fairy|Blue Fairy]] ([[Keegan Connor Tracy]]) suggests to Regina that she had best find somewhere to hide as everyone she has wronged will want revenge. Regina runs away, but not before telling a silently-watching Henry that she truly does love him. She returns to her mansion, lamenting her defeat and the loss of the only person she loves.\n \nRegaining his memories, David returns to town and finds Mary Margaret, calling out \"Snow!\" She responds by calling him Charming, confirming that they both remember. They embrace and rejoice in the fact that they have found each other again. Elsewhere around town, other Storybrooke residents are hit by the pure love shockwave, and they remember their fairytale past including [[List of Once Upon a Time characters#Ruby|Ruby]] ([[Little Red Riding Hood|Red Riding Hood]]), [[List of Once Upon a Time characters#Widow Lucas|Granny]], and [[List of Once Upon a Time characters#Jiminy Cricket|Archie Hopper]] ([[Jiminy Cricket]]).\n \nBack at the pawn shop, Gold is preparing an as-yet-unknown plan involving the potion, when [[Belle French|Belle]] enters to tell him about what Regina had done to her. Gold is shocked to see Belle still alive and overjoyed to have her back. He sets off for the woods to launch his plan and takes her with him. On their way, the curse is broken and Belle regains her memories, declaring her love for Gold. He tells Belle they will have all the time in the world, but now, they must continue with the plan.\n\nThey walk further and reach the wishing well in the woods. Gold tells Belle that the waters that run beneath it have the power to return what one has lost. He drops the love potion into the wishing well, which causes massive amounts of purple smoke to spew out of the well and spread around them. When Belle asks what is happening, Gold tells her that he is bringing the magic that they had once lost back to their world. When asked why, he tells her that magic is power. The purple smoke spreads quickly and engulfs everything (and everyone) in town. Regina watches from her mansion and deviously smiles, knowing that she will once again regain her magical powers.\n\nThe last scene shows Prince Charming and Snow White standing in the street holding each other as the purple smoke engulfs them and the clock tower. The hand of the clock moves to the infamous special time: 8:15.\n\n==Production==\n\"A Land Without Magic\" was co-written by series co-creators [[Adam Horowitz (screenwriter)|Adam Horowitz]] and [[Edward Kitsis]], while ''[[The Shield]]'' veteran [[Dean White (director)|Dean White]] returned to direct the episode.

The bank's first year was quite successful and soon, it was one of the city's leading financial institutions, functioning as a bank for businesses and also as an issuer of bonds. In 1873, the shares in Handelsbanken were listed on the [[Stockholm Stock Exchange]].<ref name=\"SHB hist\"/>\n\nIn 1887, the bank entered into a crisis due to considerable losses, but was able to pull through.<ref name=\"NF SHB\"/> In 1893, the banking company of Louis Fr\u00e6nckel was fused with [[Stockholms Handelsbank]], with Fr\u00e6nckel as the CEO. Under Fr\u00e6nckel's tenure, which lasted until his death in 1911, the bank was expanded with a [[notary]] department in 1896 and by a [[securities]] trading department in 1899. It also developed contacts with many leading foreign banks and financial institutions, which led to the buildup of trading activities in foreign currencies. The merge of the Julius Geber & Co banking company into Handelsbanken in 1906 contributed to its prominence in the Swedish [[foreign exchange market]].\n\nFrom 1914 to 1917, Stockholm's Handelsbank bought several smaller Swedish regional banks, and was in a short time transformed from a purely Stockholm-based bank to a bank with a large number of branch offices (38 in 1914 and 143 in 1917) throughout Sweden, in particular central and northern Sweden.<ref name=\"NF SHB\"/> In 1918, new branches were opened in [[Gothenburg]] and [[Malm\u00f6]] to get better national coverage,<ref name=\"SHB hist\"/> and in 1919, a bank in southern Sweden was bought, which brought the number of branch offices to over 250.

In 1926, M\u00e4larebanken was fused into Handelsbanken, bringing the number of branch offices to 270, of which 28 in Stockholm.\n\nThe [[Great Depression|worldwide depression]] following the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]] led to reduced profits, and problems for borrowers resulted in the bank taking over stock in several industrial companies to secure their loans. Handelsbanken had however been cautious in their relation to [[Ivar Kreuger]] and his financial empire so it was not much affected by the Kreuger crash following Kreuger's death in 1932. Handelsbanken did however expand its ownership in [[Svenska Cellulosa Aktiebolaget]] (SCA) as a result of the crash.\n\nIn the winter of 1943/1944, Handelsbanken formed a holding company for the companies owned by the bank after the financial problems of the 1920s and 1930s, as part of a plan to phase out the bank's ownership of these companies, which included [[L. M. Ericsson]]. The company was named Industriv\u00e4rden (\"The Industry Host\" or \"Industry Values\"), and after the bank's shareholders had been given the opportunity to acquire shares in the holding company, it was listed on the Stockholm Stock Exchange in 1945.<ref name=\"SHB hist\"/>\n\n===1945\u20131970===\nHandelsbanken continued to expand by purchasing other banks in the 1940s and 1950s - V\u00e4nersborgsbanken, Norrk\u00f6pings Folkbank, Lule\u00e5 Folkbank and Gotlandsbanken. The [[mortgage]] company SIGAB was acquired in 1955 and renamed to Handelsbanken Hypotek. In the 1955 to 1965 period, 157 new branch offices were opened, many of these in the newly built suburbs of Stockholm, in order to increase the number of customers and to expand deposits.\n\nTowards the end of the 1960s, the Swedish society saw increased socialist sentiments, just like many other European countries. This was particularly strong among students and other youth, and banks and industrialists in general were portrayed in a very negative way. During this time, Handelsbanken was also the subject of specific criticism from media and authorities, including foreign exchange transactions in 1969 that contravened regulations. The resulting crisis led to the resignation of the bank's management, including CEO Rune H\u00f6glund in 1970.<ref name=\"SHB hist\"/>\n\n===1970\u20131990===\nAfter the resignation of the previous management, Jan Wallander was recruited as the bank's new CEO. Wallander had a background as an economic researcher who had later become CEO of Sundsvallsbanken, a regional bank in northern Sweden. Under Wallander's leadership, many changes were introduced which have continued to be characteristic of Handelsbanken since that time. During 1970\u20131972, Handelsbanken created eight regional banks with a high degree of independence, to which the branch offices belonged. Much of the decision making was decentralised to the local and regional level, and the financial management and control system was overhauled, by focusing more on reporting and less on central budgeting. The new organisation focused on achieving profitability rather than on volume growth, which had been the case in the 1950s and 1960s.\n\nIn 1973, a particular form of [[profit sharing]] scheme was introduced. When Handelsbanken meets its goals of higher [[return on equity]] than the average of the other listed Swedish banks, a profit share is paid to a foundation named Oktogonen, which keeps its fund entirely in Handelsbanken shares. Payment only takes place after retirement, which means that all employees are interested in securing the long-term profitability of the bank. Oktogonen owns around 10 per cent of Handelsbanken's shares.\n\nIn 1970, Handelsbanken installed its first six [[automated teller machine]]s (ATMs), initially as a trial.<ref name=\"SHB hist\"/>\n\nIn 1985, many aspects of the Swedish financial sector were deregulated which led to a considerable credit expansion in the following years. Handelsbanken's volume of loans doubled in three years in the end of the 1980s. Sk\u00e5nska Banken and its 76 branch offices was acquired in 1990.\n\n===1990\u2013present===\nIn 1990, Sweden entered a severe financial crisis, which was compounded by the credit expansion of the late 1980s and a [[financial bubble]] related to [[real estate]] prices. Many of the Swedish banks were hit hard by this crisis and had to be [[Swedish banking rescue|rescued by the government]], which led to some of the banks being temporarily nationalised. Handelsbanken was least affected of the major Swedish banks, and was able to expand its market share in the 1990s. In 1997, Handelsbanken bought [[Stadshypotek]], a major mortgage company, from the government.\n\nIn the 1980s Handelsbanken opened several branch offices in other countries mostly to support corporate banking activities. From 1990, several smaller Norwegian, Finnish and Danish banks were acquired to build up Handelsbanken's activities and branch networks in the other [[Nordic countries]]. In 1998, Handelsbanken's operations in Denmark, Finland and Norway were organised into regional banks, and started to operate in the same way as the regional bank organisation used by Handelsbanken in Sweden since the 1970s.\n\nIn late 1991, the bank introduced [[telephone banking]] services and on 10 December 1997 [[online banking]] followed.\n\nIn 1995, Handelsbanken acquired the vast majority of the credit and financing portfolio of the former Finnish bank [[SKOP Bank]] (<small>[[:fi:S\u00e4\u00e4st\u00f6pankkien Keskus-Osake-Pankki|fi]]</small>; which went bust in the [[Finnish banking crisis of 1990s|early-1990s Finnish banking crisis]] and the [[Early 1990s depression in Finland|recession that followed]]), as well as SKOP's holdings in the Finnish Industrialisation Fund <small>([[:fi:Teollistamisrahasto|fi:Teollistamisrahasto]])</small>. \n\nIn 1999, Handelsbanken decided to expand in the United Kingdom by organic growth. At that time the bank had three offices in the UK and opened a fourth in 2000. In 2007, the bank opened its 50th UK branch office, and in 2011 its 100th UK branch office. In 2002, the UK operations were organised as a regional bank, in the same way as the bank's Nordic operations.<ref name=\"SHB hist\"/>\n\n== Subsidiaries and branches ==\n[[File:Handelsbanken, Scott Lane, Wetherby (3rd August 2015).JPG|thumb|right|Handelsbanken's branch office in [[Wetherby]], [[England]].]]\nHome markets:\n* Sweden (more than 450 branches)\n* United Kingdom (more than 200 branches)\n* Denmark (more than 50 branches)\n* Finland (more than 30 branches)\n* Norway (more than 40 branches)\n* Netherlands (more than 25 branches)\nInternational network:\n* Germany \n* Spain\n* Greater China (Beijing, Shanghai, Taipei and Hong Kong)\n* France\n* India\n* Luxembourg\n* Malaysia\n* Poland\n* Singapore\n* United States (New York City)\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n==External links==\n{{Portal|Banks}}\n*{{official website|http://www.handelsbanken.se/en/}}\n*{{official website|http://www.handelsbanken.com/}}\n*{{official website|https://www.handelsbanken.co.uk/}}\n\n{{Portal|Companies}}\n{{OMX Stockholm 30 companies}}\n{{UK banks}}\n{{Members of Euro Banking Association}}\n\n[[Category:Banks of Sweden]]\n[[Category:Banks established in 1871]]\n[[Category:1871 establishments in Sweden]]\n[[Category:Swedish brands]]\n[[Category:Companies based in Stockholm]]\n[[Category:Companies listed on the Stockholm Stock Exchange]]\n", "text_old": "{{Use dmy dates|date=November 2018}}\n{{Infobox company\n| name  =  Svenska Handelsbanken AB\n| logo  = Handelsbanken.svg\n| logo_size = 250px\n| type  =  [[Public company|Publicly traded]] [[Aktiebolag]] \n| traded_as  = {{OMX|SSE340|SHB A}}\n| key_people  =  <small>P\u00e4r Boman <small>([[Chairman]])</small>, Anders Bouvin <small>(President and [[chief executive officer|CEO]])</small><ref>[http://news.cision.com/se/handelsbanken/r/anders-bouvin-ny-vd-och-koncernchef-for-handelsbanken,c2059553 Anders Bouvin ny VD och koncernchef f\u00f6r Handelsbanken]</ref>\n| industry  =  [[Financial services]]\n| products  =  [[Bank]]ing and [[insurance]]\n| revenue  =  [[Swedish krona|SEK]] 43.77 billion <small>(2018)</small><ref name=\"InterimRepJANSEP2019\">{{cite web |title=Interim Report January\u2013September 2019 |url=https://www.handelsbanken.com/tron/xgpu/info/contents/v1/document/72-88827  |accessdate=1 November 2019 |publisher=Handelsbanken |format=PDF}}</ref>\n| operating_income  =  SEK 22.013 billion <small>(2018)</small><ref name=\"InterimRepJANSEP2019\" />\n| net_income  =  SEK 17.357 billion <small>(2018)</small><ref name=\"InterimRepJANSEP2019\" />\n| assets  =  SEK 2978.174 billion <small>(2018)</small><ref name=\"InterimRepJANSEP2019\" />\n| equity  =  SEK 142.261 billion <small>(2018)</small><ref name=\"InterimRepJANSEP2019\" />\n| num_employees =  12,549<small>(average, 2019 JAN-SEP)</small><ref name=\"InterimRepJANSEP2019\" />\n| homepage  =  [http://www.handelsbanken.com/ www.handelsbanken.com]\n| foundation  =  {{start date and age|1871}}\n| location  =  [[Stockholm]], Sweden\n}}\n'''Svenska Handelsbanken AB''' is a Swedish bank providing [[universal bank]]ing services including traditional corporate transactions, [[investment banking]] and trading as well as consumer banking including [[life insurance]].

Under Fr\u00e6nckel's tenure, which lasted until his death in 1911, the bank was expanded with a [[notary]] department in 1896 and by a [[securities]] trading department in 1899.

Although additional themed areas have been added, the original six can still be found within the park.\n\n===Grand opening===\nSix Flags Over Texas opened its gates from July 29 to August 4, 1961, to several local corporations that Wynne had invited as part of a \"soft-test opening.\" The park held its grand opening ceremonies on Saturday, August 5, 1961. Dignitaries included the mayors of Arlington, Dallas, Fort Worth, Grand Prairie and Irving.<ref name=RC117/> Park attendance reached 8,374. Admission was $2.75 (or ${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|2.75|1961}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}}) for adults and $2.25 (or ${{Inflation|US|2.25|1961}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}}) for children (cf. admission prices of $62.99 and $47.99 for the 2013 season); parking was 50 cents (or ${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|0.50|1961}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}}) (cf. $20.00 in 2013); hamburgers were 35 cents (or ${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|0.35|1961}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}}), and soft drinks were 10 cents (or ${{Formatprice|{{Inflation|US|0.10|1961}}}} in {{CURRENTYEAR}}).{{Inflation-fn|US}} On opening day, guests could visit the six original themed sections: [[Mexico]], [[Spain]], [[France]], The [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]], [[Texas]] and Modern (representing the USA). According to the 1961 Park Map<ref>[http://www.rcreride.com/html/sfot_Map.html \"1961 Park Map\"], rcreride.com.</ref> there were 46 \"major attractions\" listed. The park's first season, lasting only 45 days and ending on November 25, 1961, was a success with over 550,000 visitors.\n\n===1960s===\nThe 1960s were a decade of growth for Six Flags Over Texas. The park added numerous attractions, including two new sections: [[Boomtown]], named after the boomtowns that sprang up rather quickly during Texas' oil boom era and the \"Tower Section\", named after the [[Oil Derrick]] observation tower built in 1969. The park also witnessed the birth of two classic theme park attractions: [[El Aserradero]] in 1963 and the [[Runaway Mine Train (Six Flags Over Texas)|Runaway Mine Train]] roller coaster in 1966. Attendance reached close to 2 million visitors a year by the end of the decade. Six Flags Over Texas was one of the locations used for filming parts of the theme song for Hanna-Barbera's newest TV show [[The Banana Splits|The Banana Splits Adventure Hour]] for the fall of 1968. Sid and Marty Krofft got their debut at Six Flags Over Texas with their very own puppet show. In 1969, Six Flags Over Texas was sold by [[Angus G. Wynne]] to a new limited partnership managed by Dallas investor Jack Knox.\n\n===1970s===\nThe park's growth and expansion continued through the 1970s. It was the setting for the opening sequence in the 1971 [[Sid and Marty Krofft]] television show ''[[Lidsville]]'', in which lead character Mark ([[Butch Patrick]]) sees a magician named Merlo ([[Charles Nelson Reilly]]) perform in one of the theaters. After that Mark went to sneak backstage after his show was over, causes Merlo's hat to enlarge and falls right through it then all of sudden Mark ends up in Lidsville the land of living hats.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5IkCfvsdYQ Lidsville Opening Title and End Credits, YouTube]</ref> The park underwent new management in 1971 with the Penn Central Railroad. The park added two new roller coasters, more rides and a new section called \"Goodtimes Square\". The park also removed many of its less popular aging attractions in this decade as well. In 1975, a new mascot, Cyrus Cosmo - the inventor - was created and led many ad campaigns. By 1978, Six Flags Over Texas had had over 30 million visitors.\n\n===1980s===\nThe 1980s were another period of change for Six Flags Over Texas. The park added three roller coasters as well as a children's section themed after [[Pac-Man]] in 1983 and later changed to [[Looney Tunes]] in 1985. Six Flags Over Texas also introduced three popular festivals in this decade. Spring Breakout, introduced in 1984, brought live bands and excitement to the park for students on Spring Break. Six Flags also introduced [[Six Flags Fright Fest|Fright Nights]] and [[Holiday in the Park]] to increase attendance and extend the season.\n\n===1990s===\nThe 1990s started off with a bang when Six Flags Over Texas introduced the [[New Texas Giant|Texas Giant]], then the world's tallest wooden roller coaster at {{convert|143|ft|m}} tall.\n\nAfter a record year, Six Flags Over Texas went into a lull with management changes and name changes, as Six Flags headed into a new direction under [[Time Warner]]. After the 1991 season, the Spee-lunker's Cave was permanently closed.\n\nIn 1992, [[Yosemite Sam and the Gold River Adventure]] opened, a [[dark ride]] by [[Sally Corporation]] featuring the [[Looney Tunes]] characters, replacing the Speek-lunker's Cave.\n\nIn 1998, Six Flags Over Texas started off the year with the addition of [[Mr. Freeze (roller coaster)|Mr. Freeze]], a LIM coaster named after [[Mr. Freeze|the supervillain]] from [[DC Comics]] that had recently been featured in the film ''[[Batman & Robin (film)|Batman & Robin]]''.\n\nIn April, Time Warner sold its remaining interest in Six Flags Theme Parks to [[Six Flags#History of Premier Parks|Premier Parks]] of [[Oklahoma City]], which later changed its name to Six Flags. As part of the sale, Six Flags received longtime licensing deals with [[Warner Bros.]] for the theme park rights to DC Comics, Warner Bros. Animation, Hanna-Barbera, and more, and the two companies retained a strong relationship.\n\nIn 1999, Six Flags Over Texas introduced [[Batman: The Ride]], an inverted roller coaster by Swiss manufacturer [[Bolliger & Mabillard]]. After debuting at [[Six Flags Great America]] in 1992 and being duplicated four times over at other Six Flags parks, Six Flags Over Texas was the last to receive the ride until the now-defunct [[Six Flags New Orleans]] in 2002. Though unlike the others, that installation of the ride was not original, but was relocated from another park.\n\n===2000s===\nIn 2000, the Looney Tunes USA children's area was restructured.\n\nIn 2001, the park introduced [[Titan (Six Flags Over Texas)|Titan]], the tallest, fastest, and longest roller coaster in the park and in the state of Texas. Located in the Texas section of the park and built by [[Giovanola]] of Switzerland, it climbs {{convert|245|ft|m|1}} and features a top speed of {{convert|85|mi/h|km/h|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nIn 2002, the park kicked off the \"Best of Texas Festival\", which brought Texas history back to the park. The park also made steps toward bringing back the past, when they reopened Casa Magnetica.\n\nIn 2003, Superman: Tower of Power, a triple drop tower ride, opened in the Tower section. It was the tallest ride of its kind in the world at the time of its opening.\n\nIn 2006, the park celebrated its 45th anniversary by adding ten new attractions geared toward families. Since then, Six Flags Over Texas had placed more emphasis on families by offering a daily parade and more characters (including [[Scooby-Doo (character)|Scooby-Doo]] and the [[Justice League]]). Six Flags Over Texas also introduced Festival Latino.\n\nFor 2007 and 2008, Six Flags Over Texas was home to \"Cirque Dreams Coobrila\", a high energy cirque-acrobatic-type show housed in the Music Mill Amphitheater. On May 17, 2008, Six Flags Over Texas introduced its first roller coaster in seven years, [[Tony Hawk's Big Spin]] (renamed Pandemonium in 2011).\n\nIn 2009, debuted the \"[[Glow in the Park Parade]]\", a nighttime parade filled with thousands of lights.\n\n===2010s===\nIn early 2010, the Texas Giant roller coaster was closed to be renovated into a steel hybrid coaster, by [[Rocky Mountain Construction]] (RMC) and was reopened on April 22, 2011, as the ''New Texas Giant'' for the park's 50th anniversary.<ref>[http://www.sixflags.com/overTexas/rides/TexasGiant.aspx Texas Giant Opening April 22]</ref> In late 2010, Six Flags began the process of removing licensed theming from attractions. They terminated several licenses including their licenses with [[Tony Hawk]]. ''Tony Hawk's Big Spin'' was renamed ''Pandemonium'' in the middle of the 2011 season. ''Mr. Freeze'' was closed briefly in order to turn the trains backwards. The newly named ''Mr. Freeze Reverse Blast'' reopened on May 12, 2012.<ref>{{cite news|last=MacDonald|first=Brady|title=Six Flags amusement parks prepare for thematic makeovers|url=http://www.latimes.com/travel/deals/themeparks/la-trb-six-flags-retheme-20101122,0,3267615.story|accessdate=27 November 2010|newspaper=LA Times|date=25 November 2010}}</ref>\n\nOn August 2, 2012, Six Flags Over Texas announced the last chance to ride ''[[Flashback (Six Flags Over Texas)|Flashback]]'' and ''[[Texas Chute Out]]'' was September 3, 2012.<ref name=\"FlashChuteOut\">{{cite web|title=A Pair of Popular Six Flags Over Texas Rides Are Going Away|url=http://www.sixflags.com/overTexas/info/news_2012FlashbackChuteOutClosing.aspx|work=Press Release|publisher=Six Flags|accessdate=August 2, 2012|author=Six Flags Over Texas|date=August 2, 2012}}</ref> On August 30, 2012, Six Flags announced the park will be adding the world's tallest [[swing ride]] at {{Convert|400|ft|m|0|adj=on}} tall, called ''[[SkyScreamer|Texas SkyScreamer]]''.

In 1998, Time Warner sold its interests in the Six Flags parks to [[Six Flags#History of Premier Parks|Premier Parks]] of [[Oklahoma City]], which later changed its name to Six Flags Theme Parks, Inc.\n\n==History==\n===Initial planning and construction===\nFollowing a visit to [[Disneyland]] in [[Anaheim, California]], shortly after its opening, wealthy real estate developer [[Angus G. Wynne]], Jr. decided that his home state of [[Texas]] should have a local park for entertainment. Planning for such a place began in 1959, under the leadership of Wynne and the Great Southwest Corporation, along with the backing of various [[New York City]] investors. Construction on the park began in August 1960.\n\n[[File:Six Flags over Texas Original Logo.jpg|thumb|right|The original [[logo]] for Six Flags over Texas]]\n\n[[File:Six Flags over Texas (Entrance).JPG|thumb|right|The entrance of Six Flags over Texas welcomes visitors while the Oil Derrick [[observation tower]] looms in the background.]]\n\n===Origin of the name===\nThe name \"Six Flags Over Texas\" refers to [[Six flags over Texas|the flags of the six different nations that have governed Texas]]: [[Spain]], [[France]], [[Mexico]], the [[Republic of Texas]], the [[United States|United States of America]] and the [[Confederate States of America]].<ref name=wolcott>{{cite book|author=Victoria W.

Although additional themed areas have been added, the original six can still be found within the park.\n\n===Grand opening===\nSix Flags Over Texas opened its gates from July 29 to August 4, 1961, to several local corporations that Wynne had invited as part of a \"soft-test opening.\" The park held its grand opening ceremonies on Saturday, August 5, 1961. Dignitaries included the mayors of Arlington, Dallas, Fort Worth, Grand Prairie and Irving.<ref name=RC117/> Park attendance reached 8,374.

According to the 1961 Park Map<ref>[http://www.rcreride.com/html/sfot_Map.html \"1961 Park Map\"], rcreride.com.</ref> there were 46 \"major attractions\" listed. The park's first season, lasting only 45 days and ending on November 25, 1961, was a success with over 550,000 visitors.\n\n===1960s===\nThe 1960s were a decade of growth for Six Flags Over Texas. The park added numerous attractions, including two new sections: [[Boomtown]], named after the boomtowns that sprang up rather quickly during Texas' oil boom era and the \"Tower Section\", named after the [[Oil Derrick]] observation tower built in 1969. The park also witnessed the birth of two classic theme park attractions: [[El Aserradero]] in 1963 and the [[Runaway Mine Train (Six Flags Over Texas)|Runaway Mine Train]] roller coaster in 1966. Attendance reached close to 2 million visitors a year by the end of the decade. Six Flags Over Texas was one of the locations used for filming parts of the theme song for Hanna-Barbera's newest TV show [[The Banana Splits|The Banana Splits Adventure Hour]] for the fall of 1968. Sid and Marty Krofft got their debut at Six Flags Over Texas with their very own puppet show. In 1969, Six Flags Over Texas was sold by [[Angus G. Wynne]] to a new limited partnership managed by Dallas investor Jack Knox.\n\n===1970s===\nThe park's growth and expansion continued through the 1970s. It was the setting for the opening sequence in the 1971 [[Sid and Marty Krofft]] television show ''[[Lidsville]]'', in which lead character Mark ([[Butch Patrick]]) sees a magician named Merlo ([[Charles Nelson Reilly]]) perform in one of the theaters. After that Mark went to sneak backstage after his show was over, causes Merlo's hat to enlarge and falls right through it then all of sudden Mark ends up in Lidsville the land of living hats.<ref>[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e5IkCfvsdYQ Lidsville Opening Title and End Credits, YouTube]</ref> The park underwent new management in 1971 with the Penn Central Railroad. The park added two new roller coasters, more rides and a new section called \"Goodtimes Square\". The park also removed many of its less popular aging attractions in this decade as well. In 1975, a new mascot, Cyrus Cosmo - the inventor - was created and led many ad campaigns. By 1978, Six Flags Over Texas had had over 30 million visitors.\n\n===1980s===\nThe 1980s were another period of change for Six Flags Over Texas. The park added three roller coasters as well as a children's section themed after [[Pac-Man]] in 1983 and later changed to [[Looney Tunes]] in 1985. Six Flags Over Texas also introduced three popular festivals in this decade. Spring Breakout, introduced in 1984, brought live bands and excitement to the park for students on Spring Break. Six Flags also introduced [[Six Flags Fright Fest|Fright Nights]] and [[Holiday in the Park]] to increase attendance and extend the season.\n\n===1990s===\nThe 1990s started off with a bang when Six Flags Over Texas introduced the [[New Texas Giant|Texas Giant]], then the world's tallest wooden roller coaster at {{convert|143|ft|m}} tall.\n\nAfter a record year, Six Flags Over Texas went into a lull with management changes and name changes, as Six Flags headed into a new direction under [[Time Warner]]. After the 1991 season, the Spee-lunker's Cave was permanently closed.\n\nIn 1992, [[Yosemite Sam and the Gold River Adventure]] opened, a [[dark ride]] by [[Sally Corporation]] featuring the [[Looney Tunes]] characters, replacing the Speek-lunker's Cave.\n\nIn 1998, Six Flags Over Texas started off the year with the addition of [[Mr. Freeze (roller coaster)|Mr. Freeze]], a LIM coaster named after [[Mr. Freeze|the supervillain]] from [[DC Comics]] that had recently been featured in the film ''[[Batman & Robin (film)|Batman & Robin]]''.\n\nIn April, Time Warner sold its remaining interest in Six Flags Theme Parks to [[Six Flags#History of Premier Parks|Premier Parks]] of [[Oklahoma City]], which later changed its name to Six Flags. As part of the sale, Six Flags received longtime licensing deals with [[Warner Bros.]] for the theme park rights to DC Comics, Warner Bros. Animation, Hanna-Barbera, and more, and the two companies retained a strong relationship.\n\nIn 1999, Six Flags Over Texas introduced [[Batman: The Ride]], an inverted roller coaster by Swiss manufacturer [[Bolliger & Mabillard]]. After debuting at [[Six Flags Great America]] in 1992 and being duplicated four times over at other Six Flags parks, Six Flags Over Texas was the last to receive the ride until the now-defunct [[Six Flags New Orleans]] in 2002. Though unlike the others, that installation of the ride was not original, but was relocated from another park.\n\n===2000s===\nIn 2000, the Looney Tunes USA children's area was restructured.\n\nIn 2001, the park introduced [[Titan (Six Flags Over Texas)|Titan]], the tallest, fastest, and longest roller coaster in the park and in the state of Texas. Located in the Texas section of the park and built by [[Giovanola]] of Switzerland, it climbs {{convert|245|ft|m|1}} and features a top speed of {{convert|85|mi/h|km/h|0|abbr=on}}.\n\nIn 2002, the park kicked off the \"Best of Texas Festival\", which brought Texas history back to the park. The park also made steps toward bringing back the past, when they reopened Casa Magnetica.\n\nIn 2003, Superman: Tower of Power, a triple drop tower ride, opened in the Tower section. It was the tallest ride of its kind in the world at the time of its opening.\n\nIn 2006, the park celebrated its 45th anniversary by adding ten new attractions geared toward families. Since then, Six Flags Over Texas had placed more emphasis on families by offering a daily parade and more characters (including [[Scooby-Doo (character)|Scooby-Doo]] and the [[Justice League]]). Six Flags Over Texas also introduced Festival Latino.\n\nFor 2007 and 2008, Six Flags Over Texas was home to \"Cirque Dreams Coobrila\", a high energy cirque-acrobatic-type show housed in the Music Mill Amphitheater. On May 17, 2008, Six Flags Over Texas introduced its first roller coaster in seven years, [[Tony Hawk's Big Spin]] (renamed Pandemonium in 2011).\n\nIn 2009, debuted the \"[[Glow in the Park Parade]]\", a nighttime parade filled with thousands of lights.\n\n===2010s===\nIn early 2010, the Texas Giant roller coaster was closed to be renovated into a steel hybrid coaster, by [[Rocky Mountain Construction]] (RMC) and was reopened on April 22, 2011, as the ''New Texas Giant'' for the park's 50th anniversary.<ref>[http://www.sixflags.com/overTexas/rides/TexasGiant.aspx Texas Giant Opening April 22]</ref> In late 2010, Six Flags began the process of removing licensed theming from attractions. They terminated several licenses including their licenses with [[Tony Hawk]]. ''Tony Hawk's Big Spin'' was renamed ''Pandemonium'' in the middle of the 2011 season. ''Mr. Freeze'' was closed briefly in order to turn the trains backwards. The newly named ''Mr. Freeze Reverse Blast'' reopened on May 12, 2012.<ref>{{cite news|last=MacDonald|first=Brady|title=Six Flags amusement parks prepare for thematic makeovers|url=http://www.latimes.com/travel/deals/themeparks/la-trb-six-flags-retheme-20101122,0,3267615.story|accessdate=27 November 2010|newspaper=LA Times|date=25 November 2010}}</ref>\n\nOn August 2, 2012, Six Flags Over Texas announced the last chance to ride ''[[Flashback (Six Flags Over Texas)|Flashback]]'' and ''[[Texas Chute Out]]'' was September 3, 2012.<ref name=\"FlashChuteOut\">{{cite web|title=A Pair of Popular Six Flags Over Texas Rides Are Going Away|url=http://www.sixflags.com/overTexas/info/news_2012FlashbackChuteOutClosing.aspx|work=Press Release|publisher=Six Flags|accessdate=August 2, 2012|author=Six Flags Over Texas|date=August 2, 2012}}</ref> On August 30, 2012, Six Flags announced the park will be adding the world's tallest [[swing ride]] at {{Convert|400|ft|m|0|adj=on}} tall, called ''[[SkyScreamer|Texas SkyScreamer]]''.
