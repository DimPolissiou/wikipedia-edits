That treaty ended the three-year [[Irish War of Independence]] between the forces of the self-proclaimed [[Irish Republic]], the [[Irish Republican Army (1919\u201322)|Irish Republican Army]] (IRA); and [[The Crown|British Crown]] forces.\n\nThe Free State was established as a [[Dominion]] of the [[British Commonwealth of Nations]]. It comprised 26 of the 32 [[counties of Ireland]]. [[Northern Ireland]], which comprised the remaining six counties, exercised its right under the Treaty to opt out of the new state. The Free State government consisted of the [[Governor-General of the Irish Free State|Governor-General]], the representative of the King, and the [[Executive Council of the Irish Free State|Executive Council]] (cabinet), which replaced both the revolutionary [[Government of the 2nd D\u00e1il|D\u00e1il Government]] and the [[Provisional Government of Ireland (1922)|Provisional Government]] set up under the Treaty. [[W. T. Cosgrave]], who had led both of these governments since August 1922, became the first [[President of the Executive Council of the Irish Free State|President of the Executive Council]] (prime minister). The [[Oireachtas (Irish Free State)|Oireachtas]] or legislature consisted of [[D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann (Irish Free State)|D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann]] (the lower house) and [[Seanad \u00c9ireann (Irish Free State)|Seanad \u00c9ireann]], also known as the Senate. Members of the D\u00e1il were required to take an [[Oath of Allegiance (Ireland)|Oath of Allegiance to the Constitution of the Free State and to declare fidelity to the king]]. The oath was a key issue for opponents of the Treaty, who refused to take the oath and therefore did not take their seats. Pro-Treaty members, who formed [[Cumann na nGaedheal]] in 1923, held an effective majority in the D\u00e1il from 1922 to 1927, and thereafter ruled as a minority government until 1932.\n\nIn 1931, with the passage of the [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]], the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] relinquished nearly all of its remaining authority to legislate for the Free State and the other dominions. This had the effect of making the dominions fully sovereign states. The Free State thus became the first internationally recognised independent Irish state.\n\nIn the first months of the Free State, the [[Irish Civil War]] was waged between the newly established [[National Army (Ireland)|National Army]] and the [[Irish Republican Army (1922\u201369)|anti-Treaty IRA]], who refused to recognise the state. The Civil War ended in victory for the government forces, with the anti-Treaty forces dumping their arms in May 1923. The anti-Treaty political party, [[Sinn F\u00e9in]], refused to take its seats in the D\u00e1il, leaving the relatively small [[Labour Party (Ireland)|Labour Party]] as the only opposition party. In 1926, when Sinn F\u00e9in president [[\u00c9amon de Valera]] failed to have this policy reversed, he resigned from Sinn F\u00e9in and founded [[Fianna F\u00e1il]]. Fianna F\u00e1il entered the D\u00e1il following the [[June 1927 Irish general election|1927 general election]], and entered government after the [[1932 Irish general election|1932 general election]], when it became the largest party.\n\nDe Valera abolished the Oath of Allegiance and embarked on an [[Anglo-Irish Trade War|economic war]] with the UK. In 1937 he drafted a new [[Constitution of Ireland|constitution]], which was passed by a [[Irish constitutional plebiscite, 1937|referendum]] in July of that year. The Free State came to an end with the coming into force of a [[constitution of Ireland|new constitution on 29 December 1937]] when the state took the name \"Ireland\".\n\n==Background==\nThe [[Easter Rising]] of 1916 and its aftermath caused a profound shift in public opinion towards [[Irish republicanism|the republican cause in Ireland]].<ref>Marie Coleman, ''The Republican Revolution, 1916\u20131923'', Routledge, 2013, chapter 2 \"The Easter Rising\", pp. 26\u20138.  {{ISBN|140827910X}}</ref> In the [[1918 Irish general election|December 1918 General Election]], the republican [[History of Sinn F\u00e9in|Sinn F\u00e9in]] party won a large majority of the Irish seats in the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British parliament]]: 73 of the 105 constituencies returned Sinn F\u00e9in members (25 uncontested).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ferriter |first1=Diarmuid |title=The Transformation of Ireland, 1900-2000 |date=2004 |publisher=Profile |isbn=1-86197-307-1 |page=183 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lXa7m8wG84MC&pg=PA183 |accessdate=19 March 2019}}</ref> The elected Sinn F\u00e9in MPs, rather than take their seats at Westminster, set up their own assembly, known as [[D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann (Irish Republic)|D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann]] (Assembly of Ireland).

The [[Prime Minister of Northern Ireland]], [[Sir James Craig]], speaking in the Parliament in October 1922 said that \"when 6 December is passed the month begins in which we will have to make the choice either to vote out or remain within the Free State\". He said it was important that that choice be made as soon as possible after 6 December 1922 \"in order that it may not go forth to the world that we had the slightest hesitation\".<ref>Northern Ireland Parliamentary Debates, 27 October 1922</ref> On the following day, 7 December 1922, the Parliament resolved to make the following address to the King so as to opt out of the Irish Free State:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stormontpapers.ahds.ac.uk/stormontpapers/pageview.html?volumeno=2&pageno=1145#bak-2-1149|title=The Stormont Papers \u2013 View Volumes|first=Alastair|last=Dunning|date=1 October 2006|website=stormontpapers.ahds.ac.uk|access-date=16 January 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090319082024/http://stormontpapers.ahds.ac.uk/stormontpapers/pageview.html?volumeno=2&pageno=1145#bak-2-1149|archive-date=19 March 2009|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|MOST GRACIOUS SOVEREIGN, We, your Majesty's most dutiful and loyal subjects, the Senators and Commons of Northern Ireland in Parliament assembled, having learnt of the passing of the Irish Free State Constitution Act, 1922, being the Act of Parliament for the ratification of the Articles of Agreement for a Treaty between Great Britain and Ireland, do, by this humble Address, pray your Majesty that the powers of the Parliament and Government of the Irish Free State shall no longer extend to Northern Ireland.}}\n\nDiscussion in the Parliament of the address was short.

In practice, most of the real power was exercised by the Executive Council, as the Governor-General was almost always bound to act on the advice of the Executive Council.\n\n===Representative of the Crown===\n{{Main|Governor-General of the Irish Free State}}\nThe office of Governor-General of the Irish Free State replaced the previous [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland|Lord Lieutenant]], who had headed English and British administrations in Ireland since the Middle Ages. Governors-General were appointed by the King initially on the advice of the British Government, but with the consent of the Irish Government. From 1927 the Irish Government alone had the power to advise the King whom to appoint.\n\n===Oath of Allegiance===\nAs with all dominions, provision was made for an Oath of Allegiance. Within dominions, such oaths were taken by parliamentarians personally towards the monarch. The [[Oath of Allegiance (Ireland)|Irish Oath of Allegiance]] was fundamentally different. It had two elements; the first, an ''oath to the Free State, as by law established'', the second part a promise of ''fidelity, to His Majesty, King George V, his heirs and successors''. That second fidelity element, however, was qualified in two ways. It was to the King ''in'' Ireland, not specifically to the King of the United Kingdom. Secondly, it was to the King explicitly in his role as part of the Treaty settlement, not in terms of pre-1922 British rule. The Oath itself came from a combination of three sources, and was largely the work of Michael Collins in the Treaty negotiations. It came in part from a draft oath suggested prior to the negotiations by President de Valera. Other sections were taken by Collins directly from the Oath of the [[Irish Republican Brotherhood]] (IRB), of which he was the secret head. In its structure, it was also partially based on the form and structure used for 'Dominion status'.\n\nAlthough 'a new departure', and notably indirect in its reference to the monarchy, it was criticised by nationalists and republicans for making any reference to the Crown, the claim being that it ''was'' a direct oath to the Crown, a fact demonstrably incorrect by an examination of its wording, but in 1922 Ireland and beyond, it was the perception, not the reality, that influenced public debate on the issue. Had its original author, Michael Collins, survived, he might have been able to clarify its actual meaning, but with his assassination in August 1922, no major negotiator to the Oath's creation on the Irish side was still alive, available or pro-Treaty (the leader of the Irish delegation, [[Arthur Griffith]], had also died in August 1922). The Oath became a key issue in the resulting [[Irish Civil War]] that divided the pro and anti-treaty sides in 1922\u201323.\n\n==Irish Civil War==\n{{Main|Irish Civil War}}\nThe compromises contained in the agreement caused the [[Irish Civil War|civil war]] in the 26 counties in June 1922 \u2013 April 1923, in which the pro-Treaty [[Provisional Government of the Irish Free State|Provisional Government]] defeated the anti-Treaty Republican forces. The latter were led, nominally, by [[\u00c9amon de Valera]], who had resigned as President of the Republic on the treaty's ratification. His resignation outraged some of his own supporters, notably [[Se\u00e1n T. O'Kelly]], the main Sinn F\u00e9in organizer. On resigning, he then sought re-election but was defeated two days later on a vote of 60\u201358. The pro-Treaty Arthur Griffith followed as President of the Irish Republic. Michael Collins was chosen at a meeting of the members elected to sit in the [[House of Commons of Southern Ireland]] (a body set up under the Government of Ireland Act 1920) to become [[Chairman of the Provisional Government of the Irish Free State]] in accordance with the Treaty. The [[1922 Irish general election|general election]] in June gave overwhelming support for the pro-Treaty parties. [[W. T. Cosgrave]]'s Crown-appointed Provisional Government effectively subsumed Griffith's republican administration with the death of both Collins and Griffith in August 1922.\n\n==\"Freedom to achieve freedom\"==\n[[File:Irish Free State passport.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Irish passport|Irish Free State passport]] (holder's name removed)]]\n\n===Governance===\nThe following were the principal parties of government of the Irish Free State between 1922 and 1937:\n* [[Cumann na nGaedheal]] under W. T. Cosgrave (1922\u201332)\n* [[Fianna F\u00e1il]] under \u00c9amon de Valera (1932\u201337)\n\n===Constitutional evolution===\n[[File:Stamp irl 1922 2N6se.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Overprint]]ed stamp]]\nMichael Collins described the Treaty as \"the freedom to achieve freedom\". In practice, the Treaty offered most of the symbols and powers of independence. These included a functioning, if disputed, [[Representative democracy|parliamentary democracy]] with its own executive, judiciary and written constitution which could be changed by the Oireachtas. Although an [[Irish republic]] had not been on offer, the Treaty still afforded Ireland more internal independence than it had possessed in over 400 years, and far exceeded the most optimistic goals of the [[Irish Home Rule movement|Home Rule movement]]. However, a number of conditions existed:\n\n* The King remained king ''in'' Ireland;\n* Britain retained the so-called strategic [[Treaty Ports (Ireland)|Treaty Ports]] on Ireland's south and north-west coasts which were to remain occupied by the [[Royal Navy]]; \n* Prior to the passage of the [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]], the UK government continued to have a role in Irish governance. Officially the representative of the King, the Governor-General also received instructions from the British Government on his use of the [[Royal Assent]], namely a Bill passed by the D\u00e1il and Seanad could be Granted Assent (signed into law), Withheld (not signed, pending later approval) or Denied (vetoed).  The [[letters patent]] to the first Governor-General, [[Timothy Michael Healy|Tim Healy]], explicitly named Bills that were to be rejected if passed by the D\u00e1il and Seanad, such as any attempt to abolish the Oath. In the event, no such Bills were ever introduced, so the issue was moot.\n[[File:Irish Free State Butter, Eggs and Bacon for our Breakfasts Du beurre, des \u0153ufs et du bacon de l\u2019\u00c9tat libre d\u2019Irlande au d\u00e9jeuner.jpg|right|thumb|Poster promoting Irish Free State farm goods for breakfast to Canadians (\"Irish Free State butter, eggs and bacon for our breakfasts\")]]\n* As with the other dominions, the Irish Free State had a status of association with the UK rather than being completely legally independent from it. However the meaning of 'Dominion status' changed radically during the 1920s, starting with the [[Chanak crisis]] in 1922 and quickly followed by the directly negotiated [[Halibut Treaty]] of 1923. The [[1926 Imperial Conference]] declared the equality [including the UK] of all member states of the Commonwealth. The Conference also led to a reform of the King's title, given effect by the ''[[Royal and Parliamentary Titles Act 1927]]'', which changed the King's royal title so that it took account of the fact that there was no longer a [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]]. The King adopted the following style by which he would be known in all of his Empire: ''By the Grace of God, of Great Britain, Ireland and the British Dominions beyond the Seas King, Defender of the Faith, Emperor of India''. That was the King's title in Ireland just as elsewhere in his Empire.<ref>Long after the Irish Free State had ceased to exist, when [[Elizabeth II]] ascended the Throne, the [[Royal Titles Act 1953]][http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Eliz2/1-2/9] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130630144612/http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Eliz2/1-2/9 |date=30 June 2013 }} was passed, as were other Acts concerning her Style in other parts of the Empire. Until then the British monarch had only one style. The King was never simply the \"King of Ireland\" or the \"King of the Irish Free State\".</ref>\n*In the conduct of external relations, the Irish Free State tried to push the boundaries of its status as a Dominion. It 'accepted' credentials from international ambassadors to Ireland, something no other dominion up to then had done. It registered the treaty with the [[League of Nations]] as an international document, over the objections of the United Kingdom, which saw it as a mere ''internal'' document between a dominion and the United Kingdom. Entitlement of citizenship of the Irish Free State was defined in the Irish Free State Constitution, but the status of that citizenship was contentious. One of the first projects of the Irish Free State was the design and production of the [[Great Seal of the Irish Free State|Great Seal of Saorst\u00e1t \u00c9ireann]] which was carried out on behalf of the Government by [[Hugh Kennedy]].\n\nThe Statute of Westminster of 1931, embodying a decision of an Imperial Conference, enabled each dominion to enact new legislation or to change any extant legislation, without resorting to any role for the British Parliament that may have enacted the original legislation in the past. It also removed Westminster's authority to legislate for the Dominions, except with the express request and consent of the relevant Dominion's parliament. This change made the dominions, including the Free State, ''de jure'' sovereign nations \u2013 fulfilling Collins' vision of having \"the freedom to achieve freedom\".\n\nThe Free State symbolically marked these changes in two mould-breaking moves soon after winning internationally recognised independence:\n* It sought, and got, the King's acceptance to have an Irish minister, to the complete exclusion of British ministers, formally advise the King in the exercise of his powers and functions as King in the Irish Free State. This gave the President of the Executive Council the right to directly advise the King in his capacity as His Majesty's Irish Prime Minister. Two examples of this are the signing of a treaty between the Irish Free State and the [[Portugal|Portuguese Republic]] in 1931, and the act recognising the [[abdication crisis|abdication]] of [[King Edward VIII]] in 1936 separately from the recognition by the British Parliament.\n* The unprecedented replacement of the use of the [[Great Seal of the Realm]] and its replacement by the Great Seal of Saorst\u00e1t \u00c9ireann, which the King awarded to the Irish Free State in 1931.  (The Irish Seal consisted of a picture of 'King George V' enthroned on one side, with the Irish state harp and the words ''Saorst\u00e1t \u00c9ireann'' on the reverse. It is now on display in the Irish National Museum, [[Collins Barracks (Dublin)|Collins Barracks]] in Dublin.)\n\nWhen \u00c9amon de Valera became President of the Executive Council (prime minister) in 1932 he described Cosgrave's ministers' achievements simply. Having read the files, he told his son, Vivion, \"they were magnificent, son\".\n\nThe Statute of Westminster allowed de Valera, on becoming President of the Executive Council (February 1932), to go even further. With no ensuing restrictions on his policies, he abolished the Oath of Allegiance (which Cosgrave intended to do had he won the [[1932 Irish general election|1932 general election]]), the Senate, university representation in the D\u00e1il, and appeals to the [[Privy Council]].\nOne major policy error occurred in 1936 when he attempted to use the abdication of King Edward VIII to abolish the crown and governor-general in the Free State with the \"Constitution (Amendment No. 27 Act)\". He was advised by senior law officers and other constitutional experts that, as the crown and governor-generalship existed separately from the constitution in a vast number of acts, charters, orders-in-council, and letters patent, they both still existed.  A second bill, the \"[[Executive Powers (Consequential Provisions) Act 1937|Executive Powers (Consequential Provisions) Act, 1937]]\" was quickly introduced to repeal the necessary elements. De Valera retroactively dated the second act back to December 1936.\n\n===Currency===\n\nThe new state continued to use sterling from its inception; there is no reference in the Treaty or in either of the enabling Acts to currency.<ref>Except perhaps by inference: the Treaty assigned to the Irish Free State the same status in the Empire as Canada and the latter had already [1851{{mdash}}59] [[History of the Canada dollar#1851|replaced the British Pound]] (with the Canadian Dollar).</ref> Nonetheless and within a few years, the D\u00e1il passed the Coinage Act, 1926 (which provided for a ''Saorst\u00e1t'' [Free State] coinage) and the Currency Act, 1927 (which provided ''inter alia'' for banknotes of the [[Irish Pound#Second pound|Saorst\u00e1t pound]]). The new Saorst\u00e1t pound was defined by the 1927 Act to have exactly the same weight and fineness of gold as was the [[sovereign (British coin)|sovereign]] at the time, making the new currency [[Fixed exchange-rate system|pegged]] at 1:1 with sterling. The State circulated its new national coinage in 1928, marked ''Saorst\u00e1t \u00c9ireann'' and a [[Series A Banknotes|national series of banknotes]]. British coinage remained acceptable in the Free State at an equal rate. In 1937, when the Free State was superseded by Ireland (''\u00c9ire''), the pound became known as the \"Irish pound\" and the coins were marked ''\u00c9ire''.\n\n==Demographics==\nAccording to one report, in 1924, shortly after the Irish Free State's establishment, the new dominion had the \"lowest birth-rate in the world\". The report noted that amongst countries for which statistics were available ([[Ceylon]], Chile, Japan, Spain, South Africa, Netherlands, Canada, Germany, Australia, United States, Britain, New Zealand, Finland and the Irish Free State). Ceylon had the highest birth rate at 40.8 per 1,000 while the Irish Free State had a birth rate of just 18.6 per 1,000.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&cl=search&d=OSWCC19240311.2.5&srpos=6&e=-------10--1----2%22Irish+Free+State%22-all |title=Otautau Standard and Wallace County Chronicle, Volume XVIX, Issue 971, 11 March 1924, Page 1 |access-date=21 October 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401212422/http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&cl=search&d=OSWCC19240311.2.5&srpos=6&e=-------10--1----2%22Irish+Free+State%22-all |archive-date=1 April 2012 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n==After the Irish Free State==\nIn 1937 the Fianna F\u00e1il government presented a draft of an entirely new Constitution to D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann. An amended version of the draft document was subsequently approved by the D\u00e1il. A [[Irish constitutional plebiscite, 1937|referendum]] was held on 1 July 1937, which was the same day as the [[1937 Irish general election|1937 general election]], when a relatively narrow majority approved it. The new [[Constitution of Ireland]] (''Bunreacht na h\u00c9ireann'') repealed the 1922 Constitution, and came into effect on 29 December 1937.\n\nThe state was named Ireland ([[\u00c9ire]] in the [[Irish language]]), and a new office of [[President of Ireland]] was instituted in place of the Governor-General of the Irish Free State. The new constitution claimed jurisdiction over all of Ireland while recognising that legislation would not apply in Northern Ireland (see [[Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution of Ireland|Articles 2 and 3]]). Articles 2 and 3 were [[Nineteenth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|reworded]] in 1998 to remove jurisdictional claim over the entire island and to recognise that \"a united Ireland shall be brought about only by peaceful means with the consent of a majority of the people, democratically expressed, in both jurisdictions in the island\".\n\nWith regard to religion, a section of Article 44 included the following:\n\n{{quote|The State recognises the special position of the Holy Catholic Apostolic and Roman Church as the guardian of the Faith professed by the great majority of the citizens. The State also recognises the [[Church of Ireland]], the Presbyterian Church in Ireland, the Methodist Church in Ireland, the [[Religious Society of Friends]] in Ireland, as well as the [[Jew|Jewish Congregations]] and the other religious denominations existing in Ireland at the date of the coming into operation of this Constitution.}} Following a referendum, this section was [[Fifth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|deleted]] in 1973.\n\nIt was left to the initiative of de Valera's successors in government to achieve the country's [[Republic of Ireland Act 1948|formal transformation into a republic]]. A small but significant minority of Irish people, usually attached to parties like Sinn F\u00e9in and the smaller [[Republican Sinn F\u00e9in]], denied the right of the twenty-six county state to use the name ''Ireland'' and continued to refer to the state as the Free State. With Sinn F\u00e9in's entry into D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann and the [[Northern Ireland Executive]] at the close of the 20th century, the number of those who refuse to accept the legitimacy of the state, which was already in a minority, declined further. After the setting up of the Free State in 1923, some Protestants left southern Ireland and unionism there largely came to an end.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Ireland|Monarchy}}\n* [[Irish states since 1171]]\n* [[Series A Banknotes]] \u2013 first issued by the Irish Free State in 1928\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book|first=Tim Pat|last=Coogan|title=\u00c9amon de Valera|isbn=0-09-175030-X|year=1993|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/devaleralongfell00coog}}\n* {{cite book|first=Tim Pat|last= Coogan|title=Michael Collins|isbn=0-09-174106-8|year= 1990}}\n* {{cite book|first=Lord|last= Longford|title=Peace by Ordeal}}\n* {{cite book|first=Dorothy|last= McCardle|title=The Irish Republic|isbn= 0-86327-712-8|date= January 1999}}\n* {{cite journal|first=Donal|last=Corcoran|title=Public Policy in an emerging state: The Irish Free State 1922\u201325|journal=Irish Journal of Public Policy|issn=2009-1117|url=http://publish.ucc.ie/ijpp/2009/01/corcoran/05/en|access-date=27 October 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029201945/http://publish.ucc.ie/ijpp/2009/01/corcoran/05/en|archive-date=29 October 2013|url-status=dead}}\n\n{{Irish Free State}}\n{{Irish states since 1171}}\n{{Ireland topics}}\n{{Commonwealth realms}}\n{{British overseas territories}}{{Authority control}}\n\n{{coord|53|20|52|N|6|15|35|W|source:kolossus-kowiki|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:Irish Free State| ]]\n[[Category:Former countries in Ireland]]\n[[Category:Former Commonwealth realms|Irish Free State]]\n[[Category:Former monarchies of Europe|Ireland (1922-1937)]]\n[[Category:Former polities of the interwar period]]\n[[Category:1920s in Ireland| ]]\n[[Category:1930s in Ireland| ]]\n[[Category:History of Ireland by period]]\n[[Category:History of the Republic of Ireland]]\n[[Category:States and territories established in 1922]]\n[[Category:States and territories disestablished in 1937]]\n[[Category:1922 establishments in Ireland]]\n[[Category:1937 disestablishments in Ireland]]\n[[Category:Modern history of the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Ireland and the Commonwealth of Nations]]\n[[Category:Island countries]]\n", "text_old": "{{About|the Irish Free State from 1922 to 1937|the current Irish state|Republic of Ireland}}\n{{short description|Sovereign state in northwest Europe (1922\u20131937), Dominion status to 1922, succeeded by Ireland}}\n{{more citations needed|date=December 2017}}<!--many paragraphs have no citations-->\n{{EngvarB|date=October 2013}}\n{{Use dmy dates|date=October 2013}}\n{{Infobox former country\n| conventional_long_name                = Irish Free State\n| native_name                = {{lang|ga|Saorst\u00e1t \u00c9ireann}} {{small|([[Irish language|Irish]])}}\n| common_name                = Irish Free State\n| status                = [[Dominion|British Dominion]]\n| p1                = United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland\n| flag_p1                = Flag of the United Kingdom.svg\n| s1                = Republic of Ireland{{!}}Ireland\n| flag_s1                = Flag of Ireland.svg\n| image_flag                = Flag_of_Ireland.svg\n| flag                = Flag of Ireland\n| flag_type                = Flag\n| symbol_type                = [[Great Seal of the Irish Free State|Great Seal]]\n| image_coat                = Seal of the Irish Free State.png\n| national_anthem                = {{lang|ga|\"[[Amhr\u00e1n na bhFiann]]\"|italic=no}}<ref>Officially adopted in July 1926. {{cite book|last=O'Day|first=Alan|title=Reactions to Irish nationalism|editor=Alan O'Day|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|year=1987|pages=17|isbn=978-0-907628-85-9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EuBNO4XIu9oC&pg=PA17|accessdate=28 April 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160414162305/https://books.google.com/books?id=EuBNO4XIu9oC&pg=PA17|archive-date=14 April 2016|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref><br>\"The Soldiers' Song\"{{center|[[File:United States Navy Band - Amhr\u00e1n na bhFiann.ogg]]}}\n| image_map                = Location map of the Irish Free State.svg\n| image_map_caption                = Location of the Irish Free State with [[Northern Ireland]] in light green\n| capital                = [[Dublin]]<br>{{Coord|53|21|N|6|16|W}}\n| largest_city                = capital\n| languages_type                = Official languages\n<!--Irish is the first official language \u2013 please do not change the order-->| languages                = {{hlist|[[Irish language|Irish]]|[[English language|English]]}}\n| languages2_type                = '''[[National language]]'''\n| languages2                = [[Irish language|Irish]]\n| languages2_sub                = yes\n| religion                = {{ublist |item_style=white-space:nowrap;

That treaty ended the three-year [[Irish War of Independence]] between the forces of the self-proclaimed [[Irish Republic]], the [[Irish Republican Army (1919\u201322)|Irish Republican Army]] (IRA); and [[The Crown|British Crown]] forces.\n\nThe Free State was established as a [[Dominion]] of the [[British Commonwealth of Nations]]. It comprised 26 of the 32 [[counties of Ireland]]. [[Northern Ireland]], which comprised the remaining six counties, exercised its right under the Treaty to opt out of the new state. The Free State government consisted of the [[Governor-General of the Irish Free State|Governor-General]], the representative of the King, and the [[Executive Council of the Irish Free State|Executive Council]] (cabinet), which replaced both the revolutionary [[Government of the 2nd D\u00e1il|D\u00e1il Government]] and the [[Provisional Government of Ireland (1922)|Provisional Government]] set up under the Treaty. [[W. T. Cosgrave]], who had led both of these governments since August 1922, became the first [[President of the Executive Council of the Irish Free State|President of the Executive Council]] (prime minister). The [[Oireachtas (Irish Free State)|Oireachtas]] or legislature consisted of [[D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann (Irish Free State)|D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann]] (the lower house) and [[Seanad \u00c9ireann (Irish Free State)|Seanad \u00c9ireann]], also known as the Senate. Members of the D\u00e1il were required to take an [[Oath of Allegiance (Ireland)|Oath of Allegiance to the Constitution of the Free State and to declare fidelity to the king]]. The oath was a key issue for opponents of the Treaty, who refused to take the oath and therefore did not take their seats. Pro-Treaty members, who formed [[Cumann na nGaedheal]] in 1923, held an effective majority in the D\u00e1il from 1922 to 1927, and thereafter ruled as a minority government until 1932.\n\nIn 1931, with the passage of the [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]], the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom]] relinquished nearly all of its remaining authority to legislate for the Free State and the other dominions. This had the effect of making the dominions fully sovereign states. The Free State thus became the first internationally recognised independent Irish state.\n\nIn the first months of the Free State, the [[Irish Civil War]] was waged between the newly established [[National Army (Ireland)|National Army]] and the [[Irish Republican Army (1922\u201369)|anti-Treaty IRA]], who refused to recognise the state. The Civil War ended in victory for the government forces, with the anti-Treaty forces dumping their arms in May 1923. The anti-Treaty political party, [[Sinn F\u00e9in]], refused to take its seats in the D\u00e1il, leaving the relatively small [[Labour Party (Ireland)|Labour Party]] as the only opposition party. In 1926, when Sinn F\u00e9in president [[\u00c9amon de Valera]] failed to have this policy reversed, he resigned from Sinn F\u00e9in and founded [[Fianna F\u00e1il]]. Fianna F\u00e1il entered the D\u00e1il following the [[June 1927 Irish general election|1927 general election]], and entered government after the [[1932 Irish general election|1932 general election]], when it became the largest party.\n\nDe Valera abolished the Oath of Allegiance and embarked on an [[Anglo-Irish Trade War|economic war]] with the UK. In 1937 he drafted a new [[Constitution of Ireland|constitution]], which was passed by a [[Irish constitutional plebiscite, 1937|referendum]] in July of that year. The Free State came to an end with the coming into force of a [[constitution of Ireland|new constitution on 29 December 1937]] when the state took the name \"Ireland\".\n\n==Background==\nThe [[Easter Rising]] of 1916 and its aftermath caused a profound shift in public opinion towards [[Irish republicanism|the republican cause in Ireland]].<ref>Marie Coleman, ''The Republican Revolution, 1916\u20131923'', Routledge, 2013, chapter 2 \"The Easter Rising\", pp. 26\u20138.  {{ISBN|140827910X}}</ref> In the [[1918 Irish general election|December 1918 General Election]], the republican [[History of Sinn F\u00e9in|Sinn F\u00e9in]] party won a large majority of the Irish seats in the [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British parliament]]: 73 of the 105 constituencies returned Sinn F\u00e9in members (25 uncontested).<ref>{{cite book |last1=Ferriter |first1=Diarmuid |title=The Transformation of Ireland, 1900-2000 |date=2004 |publisher=Profile |isbn=1-86197-307-1 |page=183 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lXa7m8wG84MC&pg=PA183 |accessdate=19 March 2019}}</ref> The elected Sinn F\u00e9in MPs, rather than take their seats at Westminster, set up their own assembly, known as [[D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann (Irish Republic)|D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann]] (Assembly of Ireland).

The [[Prime Minister of Northern Ireland]], [[Sir James Craig]], speaking in the Parliament in October 1922 said that \"when 6 December is passed the month begins in which we will have to make the choice either to vote out or remain within the Free State\". He said it was important that that choice be made as soon as possible after 6 December 1922 \"in order that it may not go forth to the world that we had the slightest hesitation\".<ref>Northern Ireland Parliamentary Debates, 27 October 1922</ref> On the following day, 7 December 1922, the Parliament resolved to make the following address to the King so as to opt out of the Irish Free State:<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stormontpapers.ahds.ac.uk/stormontpapers/pageview.html?volumeno=2&pageno=1145#bak-2-1149|title=The Stormont Papers \u2013 View Volumes|first=Alastair|last=Dunning|date=1 October 2006|website=stormontpapers.ahds.ac.uk|access-date=16 January 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090319082024/http://stormontpapers.ahds.ac.uk/stormontpapers/pageview.html?volumeno=2&pageno=1145#bak-2-1149|archive-date=19 March 2009|url-status=live|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n{{quote|MOST GRACIOUS SOVEREIGN, We, your Majesty's most dutiful and loyal subjects, the Senators and Commons of Northern Ireland in Parliament assembled, having learnt of the passing of the Irish Free State Constitution Act, 1922, being the Act of Parliament for the ratification of the Articles of Agreement for a Treaty between Great Britain and Ireland, do, by this humble Address, pray your Majesty that the powers of the Parliament and Government of the Irish Free State shall no longer extend to Northern Ireland.}}\n\nDiscussion in the Parliament of the address was short. Prime Minister Craig left for London with the memorial embodying the address on the night boat that evening, 7 December 1922.

The ''[[Constitution of the Irish Free State]]'' made more detailed provision for the state's system of government, with a three-tier parliament, called the [[Oireachtas of the Irish Free State|Oireachtas]], made up of the King and two houses, D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann and [[Seanad \u00c9ireann (Irish Free State)|Seanad \u00c9ireann]] (the Irish Senate).\n\nExecutive authority was vested in the King, with the Governor-General as his representative. He appointed a cabinet called the [[Executive Council of the Irish Free State|Executive Council]] to \"aid and advise\" him. The Executive Council was presided over by a prime minister called the [[President of the Executive Council of the Irish Free State|President of the Executive Council]]. In practice, most of the real power was exercised by the Executive Council, as the Governor-General was almost always bound to act on the advice of the Executive Council.\n\n===Representative of the Crown===\n{{Main|Governor-General of the Irish Free State}}\nThe office of Governor-General of the Irish Free State replaced the previous [[Lord Lieutenant of Ireland|Lord Lieutenant]], who had headed English and British administrations in Ireland since the Middle Ages. Governors-General were appointed by the King initially on the advice of the British Government, but with the consent of the Irish Government. From 1927 the Irish Government alone had the power to advise the King whom to appoint.\n\n===Oath of Allegiance===\nAs with all dominions, provision was made for an Oath of Allegiance. Within dominions, such oaths were taken by parliamentarians personally towards the monarch. The [[Oath of Allegiance (Ireland)|Irish Oath of Allegiance]] was fundamentally different. It had two elements; the first, an ''oath to the Free State, as by law established'', the second part a promise of ''fidelity, to His Majesty, King George V, his heirs and successors''. That second fidelity element, however, was qualified in two ways. It was to the King ''in'' Ireland, not specifically to the King of the United Kingdom. Secondly, it was to the King explicitly in his role as part of the Treaty settlement, not in terms of pre-1922 British rule. The Oath itself came from a combination of three sources, and was largely the work of Michael Collins in the Treaty negotiations. It came in part from a draft oath suggested prior to the negotiations by President de Valera. Other sections were taken by Collins directly from the Oath of the [[Irish Republican Brotherhood]] (IRB), of which he was the secret head. In its structure, it was also partially based on the form and structure used for 'Dominion status'.\n\nAlthough 'a new departure', and notably indirect in its reference to the monarchy, it was criticised by nationalists and republicans for making any reference to the Crown, the claim being that it ''was'' a direct oath to the Crown, a fact demonstrably incorrect by an examination of its wording, but in 1922 Ireland and beyond, it was the perception, not the reality, that influenced public debate on the issue. Had its original author, Michael Collins, survived, he might have been able to clarify its actual meaning, but with his assassination in August 1922, no major negotiator to the Oath's creation on the Irish side was still alive, available or pro-Treaty (the leader of the Irish delegation, [[Arthur Griffith]], had also died in August 1922). The Oath became a key issue in the resulting [[Irish Civil War]] that divided the pro and anti-treaty sides in 1922\u201323.\n\n==Irish Civil War==\n{{Main|Irish Civil War}}\nThe compromises contained in the agreement caused the [[Irish Civil War|civil war]] in the 26 counties in June 1922 \u2013 April 1923, in which the pro-Treaty [[Provisional Government of the Irish Free State|Provisional Government]] defeated the anti-Treaty Republican forces. The latter were led, nominally, by [[\u00c9amon de Valera]], who had resigned as President of the Republic on the treaty's ratification. His resignation outraged some of his own supporters, notably [[Se\u00e1n T. O'Kelly]], the main Sinn F\u00e9in organizer. On resigning, he then sought re-election but was defeated two days later on a vote of 60\u201358. The pro-Treaty Arthur Griffith followed as President of the Irish Republic. Michael Collins was chosen at a meeting of the members elected to sit in the [[House of Commons of Southern Ireland]] (a body set up under the Government of Ireland Act 1920) to become [[Chairman of the Provisional Government of the Irish Free State]] in accordance with the Treaty. The [[1922 Irish general election|general election]] in June gave overwhelming support for the pro-Treaty parties. [[W. T. Cosgrave]]'s Crown-appointed Provisional Government effectively subsumed Griffith's republican administration with the death of both Collins and Griffith in August 1922.\n\n==\"Freedom to achieve freedom\"==\n[[File:Irish Free State passport.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Irish passport|Irish Free State passport]] (holder's name removed)]]\n\n===Governance===\nThe following were the principal parties of government of the Irish Free State between 1922 and 1937:\n* [[Cumann na nGaedheal]] under W. T. Cosgrave (1922\u201332)\n* [[Fianna F\u00e1il]] under \u00c9amon de Valera (1932\u201337)\n\n===Constitutional evolution===\n[[File:Stamp irl 1922 2N6se.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Overprint]]ed stamp]]\nMichael Collins described the Treaty as \"the freedom to achieve freedom\". In practice, the Treaty offered most of the symbols and powers of independence. These included a functioning, if disputed, [[Representative democracy|parliamentary democracy]] with its own executive, judiciary and written constitution which could be changed by the Oireachtas. Although an [[Irish republic]] had not been on offer, the Treaty still afforded Ireland more internal independence than it had possessed in over 400 years, and far exceeded the most optimistic goals of the [[Irish Home Rule movement|Home Rule movement]]. However, a number of conditions existed:\n\n* The King remained king ''in'' Ireland;\n* Britain retained the so-called strategic [[Treaty Ports (Ireland)|Treaty Ports]] on Ireland's south and north-west coasts which were to remain occupied by the [[Royal Navy]]; \n* Prior to the passage of the [[Statute of Westminster 1931|Statute of Westminster]], the UK government continued to have a role in Irish governance. Officially the representative of the King, the Governor-General also received instructions from the British Government on his use of the [[Royal Assent]], namely a Bill passed by the D\u00e1il and Seanad could be Granted Assent (signed into law), Withheld (not signed, pending later approval) or Denied (vetoed).  The [[letters patent]] to the first Governor-General, [[Timothy Michael Healy|Tim Healy]], explicitly named Bills that were to be rejected if passed by the D\u00e1il and Seanad, such as any attempt to abolish the Oath. In the event, no such Bills were ever introduced, so the issue was moot.\n[[File:Irish Free State Butter, Eggs and Bacon for our Breakfasts Du beurre, des \u0153ufs et du bacon de l\u2019\u00c9tat libre d\u2019Irlande au d\u00e9jeuner.jpg|right|thumb|Poster promoting Irish Free State farm goods for breakfast to Canadians (\"Irish Free State butter, eggs and bacon for our breakfasts\")]]\n* As with the other dominions, the Irish Free State had a status of association with the UK rather than being completely legally independent from it. However the meaning of 'Dominion status' changed radically during the 1920s, starting with the [[Chanak crisis]] in 1922 and quickly followed by the directly negotiated [[Halibut Treaty]] of 1923. The [[1926 Imperial Conference]] declared the equality [including the UK] of all member states of the Commonwealth. The Conference also led to a reform of the King's title, given effect by the ''[[Royal and Parliamentary Titles Act 1927]]'', which changed the King's royal title so that it took account of the fact that there was no longer a [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]]. The King adopted the following style by which he would be known in all of his Empire: ''By the Grace of God, of Great Britain, Ireland and the British Dominions beyond the Seas King, Defender of the Faith, Emperor of India''. That was the King's title in Ireland just as elsewhere in his Empire.<ref>Long after the Irish Free State had ceased to exist, when [[Elizabeth II]] ascended the Throne, the [[Royal Titles Act 1953]][http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Eliz2/1-2/9] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130630144612/http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/Eliz2/1-2/9 |date=30 June 2013 }} was passed, as were other Acts concerning her Style in other parts of the Empire. Until then the British monarch had only one style. The King was never simply the \"King of Ireland\" or the \"King of the Irish Free State\".</ref>\n*In the conduct of external relations, the Irish Free State tried to push the boundaries of its status as a Dominion. It 'accepted' credentials from international ambassadors to Ireland, something no other dominion up to then had done. It registered the treaty with the [[League of Nations]] as an international document, over the objections of the United Kingdom, which saw it as a mere ''internal'' document between a dominion and the United Kingdom. Entitlement of citizenship of the Irish Free State was defined in the Irish Free State Constitution, but the status of that citizenship was contentious. One of the first projects of the Irish Free State was the design and production of the [[Great Seal of the Irish Free State|Great Seal of Saorst\u00e1t \u00c9ireann]] which was carried out on behalf of the Government by [[Hugh Kennedy]].\n\nThe Statute of Westminster of 1931, embodying a decision of an Imperial Conference, enabled each dominion to enact new legislation or to change any extant legislation, without resorting to any role for the British Parliament that may have enacted the original legislation in the past. It also removed Westminster's authority to legislate for the Dominions, except with the express request and consent of the relevant Dominion's parliament. This change made the dominions, including the Free State, ''de jure'' sovereign nations \u2013 fulfilling Collins' vision of having \"the freedom to achieve freedom\".\n\nThe Free State symbolically marked these changes in two mould-breaking moves soon after winning internationally recognised independence:\n* It sought, and got, the King's acceptance to have an Irish minister, to the complete exclusion of British ministers, formally advise the King in the exercise of his powers and functions as King in the Irish Free State. This gave the President of the Executive Council the right to directly advise the King in his capacity as His Majesty's Irish Prime Minister. Two examples of this are the signing of a treaty between the Irish Free State and the [[Portugal|Portuguese Republic]] in 1931, and the act recognising the [[abdication crisis|abdication]] of [[King Edward VIII]] in 1936 separately from the recognition by the British Parliament.\n* The unprecedented replacement of the use of the [[Great Seal of the Realm]] and its replacement by the Great Seal of Saorst\u00e1t \u00c9ireann, which the King awarded to the Irish Free State in 1931.  (The Irish Seal consisted of a picture of 'King George V' enthroned on one side, with the Irish state harp and the words ''Saorst\u00e1t \u00c9ireann'' on the reverse. It is now on display in the Irish National Museum, [[Collins Barracks (Dublin)|Collins Barracks]] in Dublin.)\n\nWhen \u00c9amon de Valera became President of the Executive Council (prime minister) in 1932 he described Cosgrave's ministers' achievements simply. Having read the files, he told his son, Vivion, \"they were magnificent, son\".\n\nThe Statute of Westminster allowed de Valera, on becoming President of the Executive Council (February 1932), to go even further. With no ensuing restrictions on his policies, he abolished the Oath of Allegiance (which Cosgrave intended to do had he won the [[1932 Irish general election|1932 general election]]), the Senate, university representation in the D\u00e1il, and appeals to the [[Privy Council]].\nOne major policy error occurred in 1936 when he attempted to use the abdication of King Edward VIII to abolish the crown and governor-general in the Free State with the \"Constitution (Amendment No. 27 Act)\". He was advised by senior law officers and other constitutional experts that, as the crown and governor-generalship existed separately from the constitution in a vast number of acts, charters, orders-in-council, and letters patent, they both still existed.  A second bill, the \"[[Executive Powers (Consequential Provisions) Act 1937|Executive Powers (Consequential Provisions) Act, 1937]]\" was quickly introduced to repeal the necessary elements. De Valera retroactively dated the second act back to December 1936.\n\n===Currency===\n\nThe new state continued to use sterling from its inception; there is no reference in the Treaty or in either of the enabling Acts to currency.<ref>Except perhaps by inference: the Treaty assigned to the Irish Free State the same status in the Empire as Canada and the latter had already [1851{{mdash}}59] [[History of the Canada dollar#1851|replaced the British Pound]] (with the Canadian Dollar).</ref> Nonetheless and within a few years, the D\u00e1il passed the Coinage Act, 1926 (which provided for a ''Saorst\u00e1t'' [Free State] coinage) and the Currency Act, 1927 (which provided ''inter alia'' for banknotes of the [[Irish Pound#Second pound|Saorst\u00e1t pound]]). The new Saorst\u00e1t pound was defined by the 1927 Act to have exactly the same weight and fineness of gold as was the [[sovereign (British coin)|sovereign]] at the time, making the new currency [[Fixed exchange-rate system|pegged]] at 1:1 with sterling. The State circulated its new national coinage in 1928, marked ''Saorst\u00e1t \u00c9ireann'' and a [[Series A Banknotes|national series of banknotes]]. British coinage remained acceptable in the Free State at an equal rate. In 1937, when the Free State was superseded by Ireland (''\u00c9ire''), the pound became known as the \"Irish pound\" and the coins were marked ''\u00c9ire''.\n\n==Demographics==\nAccording to one report, in 1924, shortly after the Irish Free State's establishment, the new dominion had the \"lowest birth-rate in the world\". The report noted that amongst countries for which statistics were available ([[Ceylon]], Chile, Japan, Spain, South Africa, Netherlands, Canada, Germany, Australia, United States, Britain, New Zealand, Finland and the Irish Free State). Ceylon had the highest birth rate at 40.8 per 1,000 while the Irish Free State had a birth rate of just 18.6 per 1,000.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&cl=search&d=OSWCC19240311.2.5&srpos=6&e=-------10--1----2%22Irish+Free+State%22-all |title=Otautau Standard and Wallace County Chronicle, Volume XVIX, Issue 971, 11 March 1924, Page 1 |access-date=21 October 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401212422/http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&cl=search&d=OSWCC19240311.2.5&srpos=6&e=-------10--1----2%22Irish+Free+State%22-all |archive-date=1 April 2012 |url-status=live |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n==After the Irish Free State==\nIn 1937 the Fianna F\u00e1il government presented a draft of an entirely new Constitution to D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann. An amended version of the draft document was subsequently approved by the D\u00e1il. A [[Irish constitutional plebiscite, 1937|referendum]] was held on 1 July 1937, which was the same day as the [[1937 Irish general election|1937 general election]], when a relatively narrow majority approved it. The new [[Constitution of Ireland]] (''Bunreacht na h\u00c9ireann'') repealed the 1922 Constitution, and came into effect on 29 December 1937.\n\nThe state was named Ireland ([[\u00c9ire]] in the [[Irish language]]), and a new office of [[President of Ireland]] was instituted in place of the Governor-General of the Irish Free State. The new constitution claimed jurisdiction over all of Ireland while recognising that legislation would not apply in Northern Ireland (see [[Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution of Ireland|Articles 2 and 3]]). Articles 2 and 3 were [[Nineteenth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|reworded]] in 1998 to remove jurisdictional claim over the entire island and to recognise that \"a united Ireland shall be brought about only by peaceful means with the consent of a majority of the people, democratically expressed, in both jurisdictions in the island\".\n\nWith regard to religion, a section of Article 44 included the following:\n\n{{quote|The State recognises the special position of the Holy Catholic Apostolic and Roman Church as the guardian of the Faith professed by the great majority of the citizens. The State also recognises the [[Church of Ireland]], the Presbyterian Church in Ireland, the Methodist Church in Ireland, the [[Religious Society of Friends]] in Ireland, as well as the [[Jew|Jewish Congregations]] and the other religious denominations existing in Ireland at the date of the coming into operation of this Constitution.}} Following a referendum, this section was [[Fifth Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland|deleted]] in 1973.\n\nIt was left to the initiative of de Valera's successors in government to achieve the country's [[Republic of Ireland Act 1948|formal transformation into a republic]]. A small but significant minority of Irish people, usually attached to parties like Sinn F\u00e9in and the smaller [[Republican Sinn F\u00e9in]], denied the right of the twenty-six county state to use the name ''Ireland'' and continued to refer to the state as the Free State. With Sinn F\u00e9in's entry into D\u00e1il \u00c9ireann and the [[Northern Ireland Executive]] at the close of the 20th century, the number of those who refuse to accept the legitimacy of the state, which was already in a minority, declined further. After the setting up of the Free State in 1923, some Protestants left southern Ireland and unionism there largely came to an end.\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Ireland|Monarchy}}\n* [[Irish states since 1171]]\n* [[Series A Banknotes]] \u2013 first issued by the Irish Free State in 1928\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* {{cite book|first=Tim Pat|last=Coogan|title=\u00c9amon de Valera|isbn=0-09-175030-X|year=1993|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/devaleralongfell00coog}}\n* {{cite book|first=Tim Pat|last= Coogan|title=Michael Collins|isbn=0-09-174106-8|year= 1990}}\n* {{cite book|first=Lord|last= Longford|title=Peace by Ordeal}}\n* {{cite book|first=Dorothy|last= McCardle|title=The Irish Republic|isbn= 0-86327-712-8|date= January 1999}}\n* {{cite journal|first=Donal|last=Corcoran|title=Public Policy in an emerging state: The Irish Free State 1922\u201325|journal=Irish Journal of Public Policy|issn=2009-1117|url=http://publish.ucc.ie/ijpp/2009/01/corcoran/05/en|access-date=27 October 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029201945/http://publish.ucc.ie/ijpp/2009/01/corcoran/05/en|archive-date=29 October 2013|url-status=dead}}\n\n{{Irish Free State}}\n{{Irish states since 1171}}\n{{Ireland topics}}\n{{Commonwealth realms}}\n{{British overseas territories}}{{Authority control}}\n\n{{coord|53|20|52|N|6|15|35|W|source:kolossus-kowiki|display=title}}\n\n[[Category:Irish Free State| ]]\n[[Category:Former countries in Ireland]]\n[[Category:Former Commonwealth realms|Irish Free State]]\n[[Category:Former monarchies of Europe|Ireland (1922-1937)]]\n[[Category:Former polities of the interwar period]]\n[[Category:1920s in Ireland| ]]\n[[Category:1930s in Ireland| ]]\n[[Category:History of Ireland by period]]\n[[Category:History of the Republic of Ireland]]\n[[Category:States and territories established in 1922]]\n[[Category:States and territories disestablished in 1937]]\n[[Category:1922 establishments in Ireland]]\n[[Category:1937 disestablishments in Ireland]]\n[[Category:Modern history of the United Kingdom]]\n[[Category:Ireland and the Commonwealth of Nations]]\n[[Category:Island countries]]\n", "name_user": "\u0e0a\u0e32\u0e27\u0e44\u0e17\u0e22", "label": "safe", "comment": "The Constitution of Ireland come into force on 29 December 1937 not 1949, Adding event post for Republican act.", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Irish_Free_State"}

A modern [[whodunit]], the film follows a family gathering gone awry, after the patriarch's death leads a master detective to investigate. The film features an [[ensemble cast]], including [[Daniel Craig]], [[Chris Evans (actor)|Chris Evans]], [[Ana de Armas]], [[Jamie Lee Curtis]], [[Michael Shannon]], [[Don Johnson]], [[Toni Collette]], [[Lakeith Stanfield]], [[Katherine Langford]], [[Jaeden Martell]], and [[Christopher Plummer]].\n\n''Knives Out'' had its world premiere at the [[2019 Toronto International Film Festival]] on September 7, and was theatrically released in the United States on November 27, 2019, by [[Lionsgate Films|Lionsgate]]. The film received critical acclaim, particularly for its screenplay, direction, and acting, and grossed $312 million worldwide against a $40 million budget. At the [[77th Golden Globe Awards]], the film received three nominations in the Musical or Comedy category: [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture \u2013 Musical or Comedy|Best Motion Picture]], [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Musical or Comedy|Best Actor]] for Craig, and [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress \u2013 Motion Picture Musical or Comedy|Best Actress]] for de Armas. It also received Best Original Screenplay nominations at the [[73rd British Academy Film Awards]] and [[92nd Academy Awards]]. It was also selected by the [[American Film Institute]] and the [[National Board of Review]] as one of the top ten films of 2019.\n\nLionsgate announced in February 2020 that a sequel was in the works, with the film possibly becoming a [[media franchise|franchise]] centered on Daniel Craig's character.<ref name=\"sequel\"/>\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- KEEP THIS SHORT - as per [[WP:FILMPLOT]], plot summaries must be under 700 words -->Wealthy crime novelist Harlan Thrombey invites his family to his [[Massachusetts]] mansion for his 85th birthday party. The next morning, Harlan's housekeeper Fran finds him dead, with his throat slit. The police are convinced that Harlan's death is a suicide, but an anonymous party pays private detective Benoit Blanc to investigate.\n\nBlanc learns that Harlan's relationships with his family had become strained: he threatened to expose his son-in-law Richard for cheating on his wife Linda, cut off his daughter-in-law Joni's allowance for stealing from him, fired his younger son Walt from his publishing company, and had an altercation with his grandson Ransom.\n\nUnknown to Blanc, after the party, Harlan's nurse, Marta Cabrera, accidentally administered him an overdose of morphine instead of his usual medication and could not find the antidote, leaving Harlan minutes to live. To protect Marta, Harlan gave her instructions to create a [[Alibi#False alibi|false alibi]] to avoid suspicion over his death; he then slit his own throat. Marta carried out Harlan's instructions, but Harlan's elderly mother saw her and mistook her for Ransom.\n\nMarta cannot lie without vomiting, so she gives true but incomplete answers when Blanc questions her. Blanc asks her to assist his investigation. As they search the property, Marta attempts to conceal evidence.\n\nHarlan's will is read: he left everything to Marta, to her astonishment as well as the family's. They turn on her, but Ransom helps her escape. Ransom persuades Marta to confess to him and offers to help her in exchange for his share of the inheritance. The other Thrombeys try to persuade Marta to renounce her inheritance; Walt threatens to expose her mother as an [[undocumented immigrant]].\n\nMarta receives an anonymous blackmail note with a partial photocopy of Harlan's [[toxicology]] report. She and Ransom drive to the medical examiner's office, but it has been destroyed in a fire. Marta receives an anonymous email with a time and address to meet the blackmailer. Blanc and the police, also investigating the destroyed medical examiner's office, spot Marta and Ransom. After a brief [[car chase]], the police arrest Ransom; Blanc explains to Marta that Harlan's mother saw Ransom climbing down from Harlan's room on the night of his death.\n\nMarta goes to the address in the email and discovers Fran drugged, along with her missing medical case. Marta hesitates, realizing that Fran can link her to the crime, but performs [[Cardiopulmonary resuscitation|CPR]] on Fran and calls 911. Marta confesses to Blanc, but Ransom has already informed on her. At the house, Marta finds a copy of the full toxicology report hidden in Fran's [[cannabis]] stash. Marta is about to confess to the family that she caused Harlan's death, but Blanc interrupts her after reading the report.\n\nBlanc reveals his deductions to Marta, Ransom, and the police: After Ransom learned at the party that Harlan was leaving everything to Marta, he swapped the contents of Marta's medication vials and stole the antidote so she would kill Harlan with an overdose of morphine, making her ineligible to claim the inheritance by the [[slayer rule]]. However, Marta actually administered the correct medicine without reading the labels, recognizing it by the weight and viscosity of the fluid, and is therefore innocent of Harlan's death. After the death was reported as a suicide, Ransom anonymously hired Blanc to discover Marta's guilt. Fran later saw Ransom stealing Marta's medical case to hide the fact that the contents of the vials had been switched, and sent him the blackmail note. Realizing that Marta had unknowingly given Harlan the correct medication, Ransom forwarded the blackmail note to Marta. He burned down the medical examiner's office to destroy evidence of Marta's innocence. Finally, he drugged Fran with an overdose of morphine and emailed her location to Marta, planning to frame Marta for Fran's murder.\n\nMarta tricks Ransom into confessing by lying that Fran has survived and will implicate him; after he confesses and vows revenge, she vomits on him, revealing the lie. Enraged, he attacks her with a knife but discovers it is a retractable stage knife. The police have recorded Ransom's confession, and he is taken into custody as Marta watches the Thrombeys depart from what is now her mansion.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Daniel Craig]] as Benoit Blanc: A world famous private detective\n* [[Chris Evans (actor)|Chris Evans]] as Hugh Ransom Drysdale: Harlan's grandson (Linda and Richard's son), a spoiled playboy\n* [[Ana de Armas]] as Marta Cabrera: Harlan's nurse and close friend\n* [[Jamie Lee Curtis]] as Linda Drysdale: Harlan's eldest daughter, a real estate mogul\n* [[Michael Shannon]] as Walter \"Walt\" Thrombey: Harlan's youngest son, Harlan's publishing company CEO\n* [[Don Johnson]] as Richard Drysdale: Harlan's son-in-law (Linda's husband)\n* [[Toni Collette]] as Joni Thrombey: Harlan's daughter-in-law (widow of Neil), a [[lifestyle guru]]\n* [[Lakeith Stanfield]] as Detective Lieutenant Elliot: A local detective\n* [[Katherine Langford]] as Megan \"Meg\" Thrombey: Harlan's granddaughter (Joni and Neil's daughter), a liberal student\n* [[Jaeden Martell]] as Jacob Thrombey: Harlan's grandson (Walt and Donna's son), an alt-right youth\n* [[Christopher Plummer]] as Harlan Thrombey: A wealthy mystery novelist found dead after his 85th birthday party.

Johnson]], and produced by Johnson and [[Ram Bergman]]. A modern [[whodunit]], the film follows a family gathering gone awry, after the patriarch's death leads a master detective to investigate. The film features an [[ensemble cast]], including [[Daniel Craig]], [[Chris Evans (actor)|Chris Evans]], [[Ana de Armas]], [[Jamie Lee Curtis]], [[Michael Shannon]], [[Don Johnson]], [[Toni Collette]], [[Lakeith Stanfield]], [[Katherine Langford]], [[Jaeden Martell]], and [[Christopher Plummer]].\n\n''Knives Out'' had its world premiere at the [[2019 Toronto International Film Festival]] on September 7, and was theatrically released in the United States on November 27, 2019, by [[Lionsgate Films|Lionsgate]]. The film received critical acclaim, particularly for its screenplay, direction, and acting, and grossed $312 million worldwide against a $40 million budget. At the [[77th Golden Globe Awards]], the film received three nominations in the Musical or Comedy category: [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture \u2013 Musical or Comedy|Best Motion Picture]], [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actor \u2013 Motion Picture Musical or Comedy|Best Actor]] for Craig, and [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress \u2013 Motion Picture Musical or Comedy|Best Actress]] for de Armas. It also received Best Original Screenplay nominations at the [[73rd British Academy Film Awards]] and [[92nd Academy Awards]]. It was also selected by the [[American Film Institute]] and the [[National Board of Review]] as one of the top ten films of 2019.\n\nLionsgate announced in February 2020 that a sequel was in the works, with the film possibly becoming a [[media franchise|franchise]] centered on Daniel Craig's character.<ref name=\"sequel\"/>\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- KEEP THIS SHORT - as per [[WP:FILMPLOT]], plot summaries must be under 700 words -->Wealthy crime novelist Harlan Thrombey invites his family to his [[Massachusetts]] mansion for his 85th birthday party. The next morning, Harlan's housekeeper Fran finds him dead, with his throat slit. The police are convinced that Harlan's death is a suicide, but an anonymous party pays private detective Benoit Blanc to investigate.\n\nBlanc learns that Harlan's relationships with his family had become strained: he threatened to expose his son-in-law Richard for cheating on his wife Linda, cut off his daughter-in-law Joni's allowance for stealing from him, fired his younger son Walt from his publishing company, and had an altercation with his grandson Ransom.\n\nUnknown to Blanc, after the party, Harlan's nurse, Marta Cabrera, accidentally administered him an overdose of morphine instead of his usual medication and could not find the antidote, leaving Harlan minutes to live. To protect Marta, Harlan gave her instructions to create a [[Alibi#False alibi|false alibi]] to avoid suspicion over his death; he then slit his own throat. Marta carried out Harlan's instructions, but Harlan's elderly mother saw her and mistook her for Ransom.\n\nMarta cannot lie without vomiting, so she gives true but incomplete answers when Blanc questions her. Blanc asks her to assist his investigation. As they search the property, Marta attempts to conceal evidence.\n\nHarlan's will is read: he left everything to Marta, to her astonishment as well as the family's. They turn on her, but Ransom helps her escape. Ransom persuades Marta to confess to him and offers to help her in exchange for his share of the inheritance. The other Thrombeys try to persuade Marta to renounce her inheritance; Walt threatens to expose her mother as an [[undocumented immigrant]].\n\nMarta receives an anonymous blackmail note with a partial photocopy of Harlan's [[toxicology]] report. She and Ransom drive to the medical examiner's office, but it has been destroyed in a fire. Marta receives an anonymous email with a time and address to meet the blackmailer. Blanc and the police, also investigating the destroyed medical examiner's office, spot Marta and Ransom. After a brief [[car chase]], the police arrest Ransom; Blanc explains to Marta that Harlan's mother saw Ransom climbing down from Harlan's room on the night of his death.\n\nMarta goes to the address in the email and discovers Fran drugged, along with her missing medical case. Marta hesitates, realizing that Fran can link her to the crime, but performs [[Cardiopulmonary resuscitation|CPR]] on Fran and calls 911. Marta confesses to Blanc, but Ransom has already informed on her. At the house, Marta finds a copy of the full toxicology report hidden in Fran's [[cannabis]] stash. Marta is about to confess to the family that she caused Harlan's death, but Blanc interrupts her after reading the report.\n\nBlanc reveals his deductions to Marta, Ransom, and the police: After Ransom learned at the party that Harlan was leaving everything to Marta, he swapped the contents of Marta's medication vials and stole the antidote so she would kill Harlan with an overdose of morphine, making her ineligible to claim the inheritance by the [[slayer rule]]. However, Marta actually administered the correct medicine without reading the labels, recognizing it by the weight and viscosity of the fluid, and is therefore innocent of Harlan's death. After the death was reported as a suicide, Ransom anonymously hired Blanc to discover Marta's guilt. Fran later saw Ransom stealing Marta's medical case to hide the fact that the contents of the vials had been switched, and sent him the blackmail note. Realizing that Marta had unknowingly given Harlan the correct medication, Ransom forwarded the blackmail note to Marta. He burned down the medical examiner's office to destroy evidence of Marta's innocence. Finally, he drugged Fran with an overdose of morphine and emailed her location to Marta, planning to frame Marta for Fran's murder.\n\nMarta tricks Ransom into confessing by lying that Fran has survived and will implicate him; after he confesses and vows revenge, she vomits on him, revealing the lie. Enraged, he attacks her with a knife but discovers it is a retractable stage knife. The police have recorded Ransom's confession, and he is taken into custody as Marta watches the Thrombeys depart from what is now her mansion.\n\n==Cast==\n===Family===\n* [[Christopher Plummer]] as Harlan Thrombey: A wealthy mystery novelist found dead after his 85th birthday party.
