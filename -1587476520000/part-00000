It promotes the engineering of [[two-dimensional materials]] such as [[clay]], [[graphene]], [[zeolite]], as generated by the exfoliation of precursors with layered structure.\n\n== Research and work ==\nIn a series of papers, Winter and his co-worker Fancois Chambon characterized the time-evolving rheology of polymers during gelation. They discovered that the gel point is marked by power-law relaxation over a wide range of frequencies/time-scales. Depending on the type of gel, the scaling exponent may adopt a value between -1 and 0. This behavior makes it easy to uniquely identify the gel point during both chemical and physical gelation processes.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Stopping of crosslinking reaction in a PDMS polymer at the gel point|journal=Polymer Bulletin|volume=13|issue=6|doi=10.1007/BF00263470|year=1985|last1=Chambon|first1=Francois|last2=Winter|first2=H.Henning}}</ref> The experimental findings initiated active development of theories for the rheology of gels in the physics community. The findings also had technological impact, supporting the commercial development of gels as adhesives, sealants, toners, and biological materials.

For generating biaxial extension in small samples, Winter invented the technique of lubricated squeeze flow and studied it jointly with [[Christopher Macosko]]. This simple technique was the first one to provide reliable step-strain biaxial extension data which is important for accurate modeling of polymer processing operations such as film blowing and blow molding.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Lubricated-Squeezing-Flow%3A-A-New-Biaxial-Rheometer-Chatraei-Macosko/0c803ebf5377e7cabc35e769d82d47598f4445e8|title=Lubricated Squeezing Flow: A New Biaxial Extensional Rheometer}}</ref>\n\nWinter, along with Miriam Siebenb\u00fcrger and Matthias Ballauff, discovered rheological scaling laws that govern the glass transition.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Viscoelasticity and shear flow of concentrated, non-crystallizing colloidal suspensions: Comparison with Mode-Coupling Theory|journal = Journal of Rheology|volume = 53|issue = 3|pages = 707\u2013726|arxiv = 0810.3551|doi = 10.1122/1.3093088|year = 2009|last1 = Siebenb\u00fcrger|first1 = Miriam|last2 = Fuchs|first2 = Matthias|last3 = Winter|first3 = Henning|last4 = Ballauff|first4 = Matthias}}</ref> This discovery led to the development of a new criterion for distinguishing gels from soft glass.<ref>Winter, H.

For generating biaxial extension in small samples, Winter invented the technique of lubricated squeeze flow and studied it jointly with [[Christopher Macosko]]. This simple technique was the first one to provide reliable step-strain biaxial extension data which is important for accurate modeling of polymer processing operations such as film blowing and blow molding.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Lubricated-Squeezing-Flow%3A-A-New-Biaxial-Rheometer-Chatraei-Macosko/0c803ebf5377e7cabc35e769d82d47598f4445e8|title=Lubricated Squeezing Flow: A New Biaxial Extensional Rheometer}}</ref>\n\nWinter, along with Miriam Siebenb\u00fcrger and Matthias Ballauff, discovered rheological scaling laws that govern the glass transition.<ref>{{cite journal|title=Viscoelasticity and shear flow of concentrated, non-crystallizing colloidal suspensions: Comparison with Mode-Coupling Theory|journal = Journal of Rheology|volume = 53|issue = 3|pages = 707\u2013726|arxiv = 0810.3551|doi = 10.1122/1.3093088|year = 2009|last1 = Siebenb\u00fcrger|first1 = Miriam|last2 = Fuchs|first2 = Matthias|last3 = Winter|first3 = Henning|last4 = Ballauff|first4 = Matthias}}</ref> This discovery led to the development of a new criterion for distinguishing gels from soft glass.<ref>Winter, H.

They do special episodes with no ad breaks, and back-to-back marathons, which are bound to leave the most hardened and cynical viewer riddled with paranoia and fear.\"<ref name=\"Crime has never had it so good on TV: But for the moralizing, these shows do a good job of exposing society's underbelly\">{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/indiahome/indianews/article-2193535/Crime-good-TV-But-moralising-shows-good-job-exposing-societys-underbelly.html|title=Crime has never had it so good on TV: But for the moralizing, these shows do a good job of exposing society's underbelly|newspaper=[[Daily Mail]]|author=Palash Krishna Mehrotra|date=25 August 2012|accessdate=21 April 2015}}</ref>\n\nRiptide Malhotra of ''[[India TV]]'' also positively stated, \"The popularity of Crime Patrol is quite high that airs on Sony on weekends.
