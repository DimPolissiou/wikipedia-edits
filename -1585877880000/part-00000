Unlike most other games in this category, it was played without a board. Ships maneuvered on the tabletop using rulers to determine range and [[protractor]]-like angle measures on the large counters to determine facing. The game was produced without authorization from [[Paramount Pictures]], leading to its reissue in 1973 as the ''Alien Space Battle Manual'' with all ''Star Trek'' references removed, followed by a further release in 1977 as the ''[[Star Fleet Battle Manual]]'' after Zochi obtained a license from [[Franz Joseph Schnaubelt|Franz Joseph Designs]] for material in the ''[[Star Fleet Technical Manual]]''.\n* ''[[Star Fleet Battles]]'', the [[wikt:seminal|seminal]] tactical [[tabletop wargame]] created by Steven V.

Some early ''Star Trek'' games in this category have had a huge effect on subsequent games in their genre, often leading to new level of depth and complexity in programming and/or gameplay.\n\nThis [[:Category:Starship simulators based on Star Trek|game category]] includes both computer games and non-computer board games, since the Star Fleet Battles game series provides a starship simulation, and is wholly a tabletop board [[Wargaming|wargame]]. As well as the ''Star Trek'' RPG by FASA which allowed players to take charge of specific areas of a ships functions (such as the engineer allocating power) during combat.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\n''[[Star Fleet Battles]]'' is different from most other wargames, which usually indicate unit strengths with simple numerical ratings. SFB players are able to deploy and manage power for a variety of ship weapons and resources. This is done via an elaborate Energy Allocation mechanism where even partial points of energy can be allocated to a number of different systems.  ''[[Federation Commander]]'' is the continued development of this system in a more fast-paced version. Instead of the Energy Allocation system it uses an innovative tick sheet system, which manages power use for each ship, and also tracks which weapons and systems are in use.  The ''[[Star Trek: Starfleet Command]]'' computer game is based upon ''Star Fleet Battles''.\n\nIn ''Star Trek: The Role Playing Game'', produced by [[FASA]], players actually had individual bridge functions during combat. This at one point became a separate game known as ''[[Star Trek: Starship Tactical Combat Simulator|Starship Tactical Combat Simulator]]''. The Captain determined the strategy, the Engineer was responsible for power management and allocation to different systems such as weapons and shields, the Helmsman for firing weapons, the Navigator for managing deflector shields, the Communications Officer for damage control and so on.\n\nStarship simulator computer games which are set in the ''Star Trek'' universe occupy a large role in the history of computer games. Some of the earliest and more influential space simulator video games were [[:Category:Starship simulators based on Star Trek|''Star Trek'' simulations]] designed to [[Early mainframe games|run on mainframes]].\n\n[[David H. Ahl]] played such games in the late 1960s at [[Carnegie Mellon University]] and the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. He stated that they were much less sophisticated than Mike Mayfield's [[Star Trek (text game)|''Star Trek'' text game]],<ref name=\"ahl1976\">{{cite book | chapterurl=http://www.atariarchives.org/bcc1/showpage.php?page=275 | title=The Best of Creative Computing | year=1976 | pages=275\u2013281 | isbn=0-916688-01-1 | editor=Ahl, David H. | chapter=Super Star Trek}}</ref> which originated as a [[BASIC]] program on an [[SDS Sigma series|SDS Sigma 7]] mainframe system in 1971 and ported to many different systems. Ahl published source code for this game in his best selling ''[[BASIC Computer Games]]'', and variants of the game spread widely to [[personal computer]] systems.\n\n[[Decwar]] in 1978 was also a groundbreaking game. Another is ''[[Super Star Trek]]'', an early [[text-based]], [[DOS]]-based game. This game created an impressive starship experience using only text-based commands and graphics.  The game [[Begin (computer game)|Begin]] is considered notable for having a convincing model of game dynamics, as it has very few random elements, and is highly mathematical. In 1986, the game Multi-Trek (MTrek) was brought online at the University of California, Santa Cruz. Written in C for a PDP mainframe, and also available via dialup and later TELNET, MTrek was arguably the first ever game to combine a persistent world, online multiplayer environment with a real-time, true 3-dimensional game engine and versions of the game still have an active player base.\n\n[[Netrek]] was released in 1988, and was probably the first game to use both the [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]] and [[User Datagram Protocol|UDP]] protocols, the first Internet-aware team game, the first Internet game to use [[metaservers]] to locate open [[game servers]], and the first to have [[persistent user]] information.  Netrek should not be confused with NET TREK, a 1984 Macintosh game unofficially based on Star Trek.\n\nIn later years, fewer games were produced within this genre, and more games were produced in the [[Star Trek games#Role-playing games|adventure games]] genre. The first new recent game was ''[[Star Trek: Starfleet Academy (video game)|Starfleet Academy]]'', which incorporated many ''Star Trek'' elements, but was criticized for depicting starship operation as more akin to fighter planes than capital ships. A sequel, ''[[Star Trek: Klingon Academy|Klingon Academy]]'', was actually quite different, and was one of the first games to depict starship operation with an appropriate amount of complexity.\n\nThe Starfleet Command game series released by [[Interplay Entertainment|Interplay]] was based largely on the tabletop game ''[[Star Fleet Battles]]'', and comprised ''[[Star Trek: Starfleet Command|Starfleet Command]]'',  ''[[Star Trek: Starfleet Command II: Empires at War|Starfleet Command II: Empires at War]]'', and ''[[Star Trek: Starfleet Command III|Starfleet Command III]]''. It constitutes one of the most definitive current games, depicting a wide array of ship systems and ''Star Trek'' storylines. This series had a more naval flavor, and depicted a number of ship systems.  This series spawned a very large multiplayer ladder competition first with the \"Starlance\" system, and later on the \"GamerZone\" ladder. The main multiplayer setting is the \"Dynaverse,\" which began as an official server hosted by Taldren, and has continued as a private effort (an earlier, unauthorized adaptation of ''Star Fleet Battles'' as a computer game was [[Strategic Simulations, Inc.|SSI]]'s ''[https://archive.org/details/msdos_The_Warp_Factor_1982 The Warp Factor]'' in 1982).\n\n''[[Star Trek: Bridge Commander]]'' was another addition to this genre, reflecting the more deliberative, command aspects of this experience.\n\nIn late 2006, [[Bethesda Softworks]] released several console games which carry on the tradition of classic ''Star Trek'' ship simulator/combat games, ''[[Star Trek: Legacy]]'' for the [[Personal computer|PC]] and [[Xbox 360]], ''[[Star Trek: Encounters]]'' for the [[PlayStation 2]], ''[[Star Trek: Tactical Assault]]'' for the [[Nintendo DS]] and the [[PlayStation Portable]] and ''[[Star Trek: Conquest]]'' for the [[Wii]] and [[PlayStation 2]].\n\nSeveral online games have appeared on the Internet.

It has spawned several sequels. One sequel was created by Vex Xiang, and multiple others were created by fans. A newer game titled ''Star Trek: Broken Mirror'' was being developed by a man named Darkwing for several years, but was apparently abandoned in 2014.\n\n''[[Star Trek: Bridge Crew]]'' is one of the newest additions to this genre, and continues the historical pattern of Star Trek-themed simulator breaking new ground. This cross platform game is in a virtual reality environment in which four players actually occupy the bridge of the USS Aegis, Enterprise-D (Through Downloadable Content) or the Original Enterprise. Players get to see each other in real-time, and interact during the game to operate the ship and work together to handle various game scenarios.<ref>[http://www.gamesradar.com/star-trek-bridge-crew-review/ STAR TREK: BRIDGE CREW REVIEW] By Andy Hartup, gamesradar.com</ref><ref>[http://www.gamesradar.com/star-trek-bridge-crew-is-the-right-kind-of-virtual-reality-disaster/ Star Trek: Bridge Crew is the right kind of Virtual Reality disaster], By GamesRadar Staff April 24, 2017News</ref>\n\n== Pinball games ==\nFour [[pinball]] games have been based on the ''Star Trek'' series:\n*''[[Star Trek (1979 pinball)|Star Trek]]'', released by [[Bally Technologies|Bally]] in 1979, designed by Gary Gayton with artwork by Kevin O'Connor.\n*''[[Star Trek' (1991 pinball)|Star Trek: 25th Anniversary]]'', released by [[Data East]] Pinball (now [[Stern (game company)|Stern Pinball]]) in 1991.\n*''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation (pinball)|Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'', created by legendary pinball designer [[Steven Ritchie|Steve Ritchie]] and released by [[Williams (gaming company)|Williams Electronics]] in November 1993 as part of Williams' ''[[SuperPin]]'' series.\n*''[[Star Trek (2013 pinball)|Star Trek]]'', created by [[Steven Ritchie|Steve Ritchie]] and released by [[Stern Pinball|Stern]] in winter 2013.\n\n== Video games ==\n\n=== Arcade ===\n<!-- In tables, link 1st instance of terms, remove later WP:REPEATLINK(s). -->\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- \"\n!

Many PC titles have since been published, and the franchise was one of the first based on a TV program to break into the young PC gamer market in the 1990s. Activision and Viacom signed an agreement to develop games based on the Star Trek property in September 1998<ref>{{cite web|url=http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/980928/ca_activis_1.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19981202213605/http://biz.yahoo.com/prnews/980928/ca_activis_1.html|title=Activision and Viacom Consumer Products Sign Exclusive 10-Year Pact For Interactive Games Based on Star Trek Property|website=[[PR Newswire]]|publisher=[[Cision]]|via=[[Yahoo!

Titles like ''Star Trek: Armada'', ''Star Trek: Elite Force'' and ''Star Trek: Bridge Commander'' were all published during this period, as were over half of all the other major ''Star Trek'' PC games.  The absence of new titles after 2003 was due in large measure to a split and subsequent lawsuit between [[Activision]] and [[Viacom (2005\u2013present)|Viacom]] which ended in 2004.\n\nWith the departure of [[Activision]] in 2003, the franchise under the tenure of Paramount effectively came to a close. Since the end of 2005, CBS has assumed most franchise management, including games and other products.  Even with no new licensed titles released during 2003-2006, the older games like ''Armada'' and ''Elite Force'' still have an avid fan base which keeps the small community going.  Development of the new ''Star Trek: Online'' title is complete and the game was made available for sale on February 2, 2010.<ref>Star Trek Online [http://startrekonline.com/node/490|official website]</ref>\n\n''[[Star Trek: Alien Domain]]'' is a flash-based  ''[[Star Trek]]'' multiplayer strategy game currently in open beta phase developed by [[GameSamba]], in conjunction with [[CBS Interactive]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kotaku.com.au/2014/09/boldly-build-bases-in-star-trek-alien-domain/|title=Boldly Build Bases In Star Trek: Alien Domain|work=kotaku.com.au|first=Mike|last=Fahey|date=September 17, 2015|accessdate=July 27, 2015}}</ref>\n\n==== Commercial games ====\n<!-- In tables, link 1st instance of terms, remove later WP:REPEATLINK(s). -->\n{| class=\"wikitable sortable\"\n|- \"\n!

Some early ''Star Trek'' games in this category have had a huge effect on subsequent games in their genre, often leading to new level of depth and complexity in programming and/or gameplay.\n\nThis [[:Category:Starship simulators based on Star Trek|game category]] includes both computer games and non-computer board games, since the Star Fleet Battles game series provides a starship simulation, and is wholly a tabletop board [[Wargaming|wargame]]. As well as the ''Star Trek'' RPG by FASA which allowed players to take charge of specific areas of a ships functions (such as the engineer allocating power) during combat.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\n''[[Star Fleet Battles]]'' is different from most other wargames, which usually indicate unit strengths with simple numerical ratings. SFB players are able to deploy and manage power for a variety of ship weapons and resources. This is done via an elaborate Energy Allocation mechanism where even partial points of energy can be allocated to a number of different systems.  ''[[Federation Commander]]'' is the continued development of this system in a more fast-paced version. Instead of the Energy Allocation system it uses an innovative tick sheet system, which manages power use for each ship, and also tracks which weapons and systems are in use.  The ''[[Star Trek: Starfleet Command]]'' computer game is based upon ''Star Fleet Battles''.\n\nIn ''Star Trek: The Role Playing Game'', produced by [[FASA]], players actually had individual bridge functions during combat. This at one point became a separate game known as ''[[Star Trek: Starship Tactical Combat Simulator|Starship Tactical Combat Simulator]]''. The Captain determined the strategy, the Engineer was responsible for power management and allocation to different systems such as weapons and shields, the Helmsman for firing weapons, the Navigator for managing deflector shields, the Communications Officer for damage control and so on.\n\nStarship simulator computer games which are set in the ''Star Trek'' universe occupy a large role in the history of computer games. Some of the earliest and more influential space simulator video games were [[:Category:Starship simulators based on Star Trek|''Star Trek'' simulations]] designed to [[Early mainframe games|run on mainframes]].\n\n[[David H. Ahl]] played such games in the late 1960s at [[Carnegie Mellon University]] and the [[University of California, Berkeley]]. He stated that they were much less sophisticated than Mike Mayfield's [[Star Trek (text game)|''Star Trek'' text game]],<ref name=\"ahl1976\">{{cite book | chapterurl=http://www.atariarchives.org/bcc1/showpage.php?page=275 | title=The Best of Creative Computing | year=1976 | pages=275\u2013281 | isbn=0-916688-01-1 | editor=Ahl, David H. | chapter=Super Star Trek}}</ref> which originated as a [[BASIC]] program on an [[SDS Sigma series|SDS Sigma 7]] mainframe system in 1971 and ported to many different systems. Ahl published source code for this game in his best selling ''[[BASIC Computer Games]]'', and variants of the game spread widely to [[personal computer]] systems.\n\n[[Decwar]] in 1978 was also a groundbreaking game. Another is ''[[Super Star Trek]]'', an early [[text-based]], [[DOS]]-based game. This game created an impressive starship experience using only text-based commands and graphics.  The game [[Begin (computer game)|Begin]] is considered notable for having a convincing model of game dynamics, as it has very few random elements, and is highly mathematical. In 1986, the game Multi-Trek (MTrek) was brought online at the University of California, Santa Cruz. Written in C for a PDP mainframe, and also available via dialup and later TELNET, MTrek was arguably the first ever game to combine a persistent world, online multiplayer environment with a real-time, true 3-dimensional game engine and versions of the game still have an active player base.\n\n[[Netrek]] was released in 1988, and was probably the first game to use both the [[Transmission Control Protocol|TCP]] and [[User Datagram Protocol|UDP]] protocols, the first Internet-aware team game, the first Internet game to use [[metaservers]] to locate open [[game servers]], and the first to have [[persistent user]] information.  Netrek should not be confused with NET TREK, a 1984 Macintosh game unofficially based on Star Trek.\n\nIn later years, fewer games were produced within this genre, and more games were produced in the [[Star Trek games#Role-playing games|adventure games]] genre. The first new recent game was ''[[Star Trek: Starfleet Academy (video game)|Starfleet Academy]]'', which incorporated many ''Star Trek'' elements, but was criticized for depicting starship operation as more akin to fighter planes than capital ships. A sequel, ''[[Star Trek: Klingon Academy|Klingon Academy]]'', was actually quite different, and was one of the first games to depict starship operation with an appropriate amount of complexity.\n\nThe Starfleet Command game series released by [[Interplay Entertainment|Interplay]] was based largely on the tabletop game ''[[Star Fleet Battles]]'', and comprised ''[[Star Trek: Starfleet Command|Starfleet Command]]'',  ''[[Star Trek: Starfleet Command II: Empires at War|Starfleet Command II: Empires at War]]'', and ''[[Star Trek: Starfleet Command III|Starfleet Command III]]''. It constitutes one of the most definitive current games, depicting a wide array of ship systems and ''Star Trek'' storylines. This series had a more naval flavor, and depicted a number of ship systems.  This series spawned a very large multiplayer ladder competition first with the \"Starlance\" system, and later on the \"GamerZone\" ladder. The main multiplayer setting is the \"Dynaverse,\" which began as an official server hosted by Taldren, and has continued as a private effort (an earlier, unauthorized adaptation of ''Star Fleet Battles'' as a computer game was [[Strategic Simulations, Inc.|SSI]]'s ''[https://archive.org/details/msdos_The_Warp_Factor_1982 The Warp Factor]'' in 1982).\n\n''[[Star Trek: Bridge Commander]]'' was another addition to this genre, reflecting the more deliberative, command aspects of this experience.\n\nIn late 2006, [[Bethesda Softworks]] released several console games which carry on the tradition of classic ''Star Trek'' ship simulator/combat games, ''[[Star Trek: Legacy]]'' for the [[Personal computer|PC]] and [[Xbox 360]], ''[[Star Trek: Encounters]]'' for the [[PlayStation 2]], ''[[Star Trek: Tactical Assault]]'' for the [[Nintendo DS]] and the [[PlayStation Portable]] and ''[[Star Trek: Conquest]]'' for the [[Wii]] and [[PlayStation 2]].\n\nSeveral online games have appeared on the Internet. ''[[Vega Trek]]'' is a [[game mod]] which is planned to eventually become active as a multiplayer game.<ref>[http://wcuniverse.sourceforge.net/vegatrek/features.html Posting on official website] for Vega Trek. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080723163348/http://wcuniverse.sourceforge.net/vegatrek/features.html |date=July 23, 2008 }}</ref> ''Flashtrek: Broken Mirror'', first created by Vex Xiang, is one of the online ''Star Trek'' games, and is entirely [[browser-based]]. It has spawned several sequels. One sequel was created by Vex Xiang, and multiple others were created by fans. A newer game titled ''Star Trek: Broken Mirror'' was being developed by a man named Darkwing for several years, but was apparently abandoned in 2014.\n\n''[[Star Trek: Bridge Crew]]'' is one of the newest additions to this genre, and continues the historical pattern of Star Trek-themed simulator breaking new ground. This cross platform game is in a virtual reality environment in which four players actually occupy the bridge of the USS Aegis, Enterprise-D (Through Downloadable Content) or the Original Enterprise. Players get to see each other in real-time, and interact during the game to operate the ship and work together to handle various game scenarios.<ref>[http://www.gamesradar.com/star-trek-bridge-crew-review/ STAR TREK: BRIDGE CREW REVIEW] By Andy Hartup, gamesradar.com</ref><ref>[http://www.gamesradar.com/star-trek-bridge-crew-is-the-right-kind-of-virtual-reality-disaster/ Star Trek: Bridge Crew is the right kind of Virtual Reality disaster], By GamesRadar Staff April 24, 2017News</ref>\n\n== Pinball games ==\nFour [[pinball]] games have been based on the ''Star Trek'' series:\n*''[[Star Trek (1979 pinball)|Star Trek]]'', released by [[Bally Technologies|Bally]] in 1979, designed by Gary Gayton with artwork by Kevin O'Connor.\n*''[[Star Trek' (1991 pinball)|Star Trek: 25th Anniversary]]'', released by [[Data East]] Pinball (now [[Stern (game company)|Stern Pinball]]) in 1991.\n*''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation (pinball)|Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'', created by legendary pinball designer [[Steven Ritchie|Steve Ritchie]] and released by [[Williams (gaming company)|Williams Electronics]] in November 1993 as part of Williams' ''[[SuperPin]]'' series.\n*''[[Star Trek (2013 pinball)|Star Trek]]'', created by [[Steven Ritchie|Steve Ritchie]] and released by [[Stern Pinball|Stern]] in winter 2013.\n\n== Video games ==\n\n=== Arcade ===\n<!-- In tables, link 1st instance of terms, remove later WP:REPEATLINK(s). -->\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|- \"\n!

Titles like ''Star Trek: Armada'', ''Star Trek: Elite Force'' and ''Star Trek: Bridge Commander'' were all published during this period, as were over half of all the other major ''Star Trek'' PC games.  The absence of new titles after 2003 was due in large measure to a split and subsequent lawsuit between [[Activision]] and [[Viacom (2005\u2013present)|Viacom]] which ended in 2004.\n\nWith the departure of [[Activision]] in 2003, the franchise under the tenure of Paramount effectively came to a close.

Even with no new licensed titles released during 2003-2006, the older games like ''Armada'' and ''Elite Force'' still have an avid fan base which keeps the small community going.

The plot below uses a [[Logarithmic scale|log scale]] for all four y axes on one plot to show relationships between the trends. On a log scale, data that shows exponential growth will plot as a more-or-less straight line. Each major division is a factor of ten. This makes the slope of the plot the relative rate of change anywhere in the timeline, which allows comparison of one plot with the others throughout the pandemic.<!--One option in the Graph:Chart template, \"yScaleType=log\" makes this happen; this option was added for this article and is not yet documented in the template.

for epidemics and pandemics are to contain or limit further outbreaks. Those actions will often involve tracing contacts, implementing quarantines, and isolating infectious cases. They will demand significant human resources and government staffing at all levels. As an outbreak grows, new facilities may need to be constructed to manage additional infectious cases.<ref name=NCBI>[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK525302/#pt5.ch17.sec2 \"Pandemics: Risks, Impacts, and Mitigation\"], [[National Center for Biotechnology Information]] (NCBI)</ref>\n\nNational medical organizations like the CDC focus on both containment to first keep the virus from spreading after its detection, and mitigation, to prevent it from spreading quickly beyond containment limits. The process of mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic is needed to extend its time frame by spreading out cases and isolating individuals, which slows the spread of the disease. By that means, it lowers the peak, or number of new cases, which reduces the likelihood of suddenly over-crowding doctors' offices and hospitals beyond their capacity.<ref name=cleveland>[https://www.cleveland.com/news/2020/03/mad-about-coronavirus-cancellations-heres-why-mitigating-the-curve-matters.html \"Mad about coronavirus cancellations? Here's why mitigating the curve matters\"], ''Cleveland.com'', March 12, 2020</ref>\n\nThe risk of a truly global pandemic is limited for some diseases, such as [[Ebola]], because of the slow pace of transmission or high probability of detection and containment. COVID-19 is at the other extreme, being a pathogen that has high potential to cause a severe pandemic, especially because it easily transmits between people and remains asymptomatic for a long period, thereby lengthening the time it is infectious and not detected.<ref name=NCBI/>\n\nIn general, once a pandemic has begun within a country's borders, the government must begin taking steps to curtail interactions between infected and uninfected populations. The methods used could include isolation of infected patients, quarantine, physical distancing practices, school closures, use of personal protective equipment, and [[Travel restrictions related to the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|travel restrictions]].<ref name=NCBI/>\n\nThe WHO on January 30 warned that \"all countries should be prepared for containment, including active surveillance, early detection, isolation and case management, [[contact tracing]] and prevention of onward spread\" of the virus.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Kennedy |first1=Merrit |title=WHO Declares Coronavirus Outbreak A Global Health Emergency |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/01/30/798894428/who-declares-coronavirus-outbreak-a-global-health-emergency |accessdate=March 30, 2020 |work=[[NPR]] |date=January 30, 2020}}</ref> February 25 was the first day the CDC told the American public to prepare for an outbreak.<ref>Marisa Taylor ''[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-china-cdc-exclusiv-idUSKBN21910S Exclusive: U.S. axed CDC expert job in China months before virus outbreak]'' March 22, 2020 Reuters.com</ref>\n\nAt a White House press briefing on April 1, 2020, [[Anthony Fauci|Dr. Anthony S.

The plot below uses a [[Logarithmic scale|log scale]] for all four y axes on one plot to show relationships between the trends. On a log scale, data that shows exponential growth will plot as a more-or-less straight line. Each major division is a factor of ten. This makes the slope of the plot the relative rate of change anywhere in the timeline, which allows comparison of one plot with the others throughout the pandemic.<!--One option in the Graph:Chart template, \"yScaleType=log\" makes this happen; this option was added for this article and is not yet documented in the template.

for epidemics and pandemics are to contain or limit further outbreaks. Those actions will often involve tracing contacts, implementing quarantines, and isolating infectious cases. They will demand significant human resources and government staffing at all levels. As an outbreak grows, new facilities may need to be constructed to manage additional infectious cases.<ref name=NCBI>[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK525302/#pt5.ch17.sec2 \"Pandemics: Risks, Impacts, and Mitigation\"], [[National Center for Biotechnology Information]] (NCBI)</ref>\n\nNational medical organizations like the CDC focus on both containment to first keep the virus from spreading after its detection, and mitigation, to prevent it from spreading quickly beyond containment limits. The process of mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic is needed to extend its time frame by spreading out cases and isolating individuals, which slows the spread of the disease. By that means, it lowers the peak, or number of new cases, which reduces the likelihood of suddenly over-crowding doctors' offices and hospitals beyond their capacity.<ref name=cleveland>[https://www.cleveland.com/news/2020/03/mad-about-coronavirus-cancellations-heres-why-mitigating-the-curve-matters.html \"Mad about coronavirus cancellations? Here's why mitigating the curve matters\"], ''Cleveland.com'', March 12, 2020</ref>\n\nThe risk of a truly global pandemic is limited for some diseases, such as [[Ebola]], because of the slow pace of transmission or high probability of detection and containment. COVID-19 is at the other extreme, being a pathogen that has high potential to cause a severe pandemic, especially because it easily transmits between people and remains asymptomatic for a long period, thereby lengthening the time it is infectious and not detected.<ref name=NCBI/>\n\nIn general, once a pandemic has begun within a country's borders, the government must begin taking steps to curtail interactions between infected and uninfected populations. The methods used could include isolation of infected patients, quarantine, physical distancing practices, school closures, use of personal protective equipment, and [[Travel restrictions related to the 2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic|travel restrictions]].<ref name=NCBI/>\n\nThe WHO on January 30 warned that \"all countries should be prepared for containment, including active surveillance, early detection, isolation and case management, [[contact tracing]] and prevention of onward spread\" of the virus.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Kennedy |first1=Merrit |title=WHO Declares Coronavirus Outbreak A Global Health Emergency |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/01/30/798894428/who-declares-coronavirus-outbreak-a-global-health-emergency |accessdate=March 30, 2020 |work=[[NPR]] |date=January 30, 2020}}</ref> February 25 was the first day the CDC told the American public to prepare for an outbreak.<ref>Marisa Taylor ''[https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-china-cdc-exclusiv-idUSKBN21910S Exclusive: U.S. axed CDC expert job in China months before virus outbreak]'' March 22, 2020 Reuters.com</ref>\n\nAt a White House press briefing on April 1, 2020, [[Anthony Fauci|Dr. Anthony S.
