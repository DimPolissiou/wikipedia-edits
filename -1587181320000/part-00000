{"title_page": "The Helsinki School", "text_new": "The name Helsinki School was introduced in an article by Boris Hohmeyer, Aufbruch im hohen Norden [breakthrough in the far north], in [[art Das Kunstmagazin]] in 2003. This was the first time it was used as a brand name to describe a selection of artists who had studied under adjunct professor Timothy Persons at Aalto University School of Arts, Architecture and Design in Helsinki from the beginning of 90s until now. What began as an educational project over 25 years ago, has evolved into one of the longest lasting photographic movements of its kind, representing over five generations of artists with more than 160 books by international publishers (Hatje Cantz, Steidl, Aperture, Kehrer). It was based upon a Professional Studies program that was unique in how it used its academic platform to create an environment that blended its teachers, students and former graduates together in a contextual dialogue through group exhibitions, publications and the utilization of the international art fairs as a means for teaching, referencing and presenting these artists\u2019 works to the international community.\n\n==History==\nPentti Sammallahti and Arno Rafael Minkkinen were the original mentors who inspired the first generation of artists like Jorma Puranen, Ulla Jokisalo and Timo Kelaranta. The next generation would already be composed by artists like such as: Jyrki Parantainen, Marjaana Kella, Pertti Kekarainen, Joakim Eskildsen, Ilkka Halso, Tiina Itkonen, Elina Brotherus, Aino Kannisto, [[Ola Kolehmainen]], Janne Lehtinen, Sanna Kannisto and Riitta P\u00e4iv\u00e4l\u00e4inen.\nThe third generation: Sandra Kantanen, Ari Kakkinen, Niko Luoma, Santeri Tuori and Jari Silom\u00e4ki.\nThe fourth generation: Ville Lenkkeri, Anni Lepp\u00e4l\u00e4, Susanna Majuri, Mikko Sinervo, Nelli Palom\u00e4ki, Milja Laurila, Niina Vatanen, Eeva Karhu.\nFifth generation: Tanja Koljonen, Juuso Noronkoski, Mikko Rikala.\nSixth generation: Ville Kumpulainen, Jaakko Kahilaniemi, Hilla Kurki, Rainer Paananen.\n\n==Characteristics==\nThe Helsinki School follows other of two key photographic movements: The New American Color Photography which established color photography as an important artistic medium, beginning with the William Eggleston exhibition at the MoMA in New York in 1976. And the D\u00fcsseldorf School, which emerged in the late 1970s under the guidance of Bernd and Hilla Becher, followers of the 1920s German tradition of Neue Sachlichkeit [New Objectivity]. Their students, [[Andreas Gursky]], Candida H\u00f6fer, Thomas Ruff and Thomas Struth modified the approach by applying new technical possibilities and contemporary vision. These movements combined with the influence of the Icelandic minimalism and artists like Donald Judd, played a pivotal role in understanding the roots of the Helsinki School.\n\nThe Helsinki School was based upon a Professional Studies program that was unique in how it used its academic platform to create an environment that blended its teachers, students and former graduates together in a contextual dialogue through group exhibitions, publications and the utilization of the international art fairs as a means for teaching, referencing and presenting these artists\u2019 works to the international community. \nThis collective dialogue is one of the cornerstones the Helsinki School\u2019s concept was built upon. It's grounded on an approach that introduces the students in how to use criticism as a positive tool. This places the emphasis more on how to find solutions rather than the fear of making mistakes. Due to financial restrictions, common to many universities, Aalto has conceived a system where students teach each other through their shared experiences. A good example of this is in Aalto\u2019s intern program of sending selected students abroad to work in residencies, galleries and other professional platforms. This academic platform could not have been realized without the inspired efforts of a core group of professors beginning with Pentti Sammallahti, Arno Rafael Minkkinen, Jorma Puranen, Ulla Jokisalo, Timo Kelaranta, Jyrki Parantainen and Niko Luoma.\n\nGallery Taik Persons (currently Persons Project) was conceived as the vehicle to join all these generations together. The gallery was established in 1995 in Helsinki, however, since 2005 its permanent exhibition space has been located in Berlin. Its primary responsibility is to prepare and guide the students in how to manage their professional life. The gallery also acts as an educational bridge connecting these selected students with other galleries both in and around the Nordic region. It is one of the cultural conduits for introducing the artists\u2019 works to established curators, publishers, collectors and museums, met through Gallery Taik Persons\u2019 participations in various international forums.\n\nDefining traits:\n\nIt\u2019s impossible to measure the Helsinki School from a specific point of view, as each upcoming generation is given the time and opportunity to invent itself. But what they have in common is how they all use the photographic process as a tool for conceptual thinking.  During 25 years the Helsinki School revolutionized the art scene with a shift from black and white social documentary photography to a conceptual approach, which is subjective and creates an ultra-modern view of Nordic culture. \nThe idea of photography moves on from the capture of a single instant to a gathering of instants, where each image becomes its own archive. The way a photograph is experienced is thus transformed, it is no longer a tableau whose various signifiers must be read and related but a reflective or meditative occasion.\n\n\u201cThere is a clarity of vision that seems to come out of the late evening northern summer light. The conceptual base is lucidly presented. There is an honesty and sincerity behind the work that is rare to find among a group of artists, (\u2026) the borderland discourse, which touches the very idea of identity. Many Helsinki School pictures bear signs of Finnish culture, unconscious or not, meanings related to nature and remoteness. This is quite natural in a country so sparsely populated. These photographs seem to be presentations of artists who sink with themselves.\u201d His verdict diverges from mine, however, in that he says, \u201cTheir photographs seem to be covering something, preferably hiding and hinting than saying anything direct.\u201d Yes, there is ambiguity, yes there is a Northern loneliness, but it speaks very directly. There is a sense of isolation in the way several of the artists express their identity. \nInstead of direct contact with somebody in the picture, photographs became full of landscapes, empty spaces, and figures somewhere in distance.\u201d  (Alistair Hicks, The Helsinki School Vol. 5 p. 22)\n\nThis fertile meeting point that is the Helsinki School, a meeting point of psychology, perception and reflection, might have occurred in other places, but it may be that to truly understand its genesis, we have to consider more deeply the environmental texture of light, time, climate and language that is the city itself. \nNotably, abstraction has been given a role of greater importance within the Helsinki School. By photographically experimenting with various eventualities of multiple exposures on the very same negative, the utilization of light as a raw material and thereby as an elementary component of and to the work has opened up manifold opportunities to the artistic self-understanding of the students. In the space of this creative developments the ambiguity and the interplay of shadow and light merging just into the borders of geometric abstraction have become an essential feature to describe several of the Helsinki School\u2019s artists and their method of operating.\n\n== Art of Teaching ==\nThe Helsinki School\u2019s defining trait is the use of the photographic process as a tool for conceptual thinking. It was founded in 1995 in Helsinki and is to this day directed by adjunct professor Timothy Persons, who also created Persons Projects (former Taik Persons Gallery) based in Berlin.\n\n==Publications ==\nThe Helsinki School platform sustains a direct link to its former alumni by joining their works with each new generation of graduates through the publication of \u201cThe Helsinki School\u201d books by Hatje Cantz, that is currently in its 6th volume.

This was the first time it was used as a brand name to describe a selection of artists who had studied under adjunct professor Timothy Persons at Aalto University School of Arts, Architecture and Design in Helsinki from the beginning of 90s until now. What began as an educational project over 25 years ago, has evolved into one of the longest lasting photographic movements of its kind, representing over five generations of artists with more than 160 books by international publishers (Hatje Cantz, Steidl, Aperture, Kehrer). It was based upon a Professional Studies program that was unique in how it used its academic platform to create an environment that blended its teachers, students and former graduates together in a contextual dialogue through group exhibitions, publications and the utilization of the international art fairs as a means for teaching, referencing and presenting these artists\u2019 works to the international community.\n\n==History==\nPentti Sammallahti and Arno Rafael Minkkinen were the original mentors who inspired the first generation of artists like Jorma Puranen, Ulla Jokisalo and Timo Kelaranta. The next generation would already be composed by artists like such as: Jyrki Parantainen, Marjaana Kella, Pertti Kekarainen, Joakim Eskildsen, Ilkka Halso, Tiina Itkonen, Elina Brotherus, Aino Kannisto, [[Ola Kolehmainen]], Janne Lehtinen, Sanna Kannisto and Riitta P\u00e4iv\u00e4l\u00e4inen.\nThe third generation: Sandra Kantanen, Ari Kakkinen, Niko Luoma, Santeri Tuori and Jari Silom\u00e4ki.\nThe fourth generation: Ville Lenkkeri, Anni Lepp\u00e4l\u00e4, Susanna Majuri, Mikko Sinervo, Nelli Palom\u00e4ki, Milja Laurila, Niina Vatanen, Eeva Karhu.\nFifth generation: Tanja Koljonen, Juuso Noronkoski, Mikko Rikala.\nSixth generation: Ville Kumpulainen, Jaakko Kahilaniemi, Hilla Kurki, Rainer Paananen.\n\n==Characteristics==\nThe Helsinki School follows other of two key photographic movements: The New American Color Photography which established color photography as an important artistic medium, beginning with the William Eggleston exhibition at the MoMA in New York in 1976. And the D\u00fcsseldorf School, which emerged in the late 1970s under the guidance of Bernd and Hilla Becher, followers of the 1920s German tradition of Neue Sachlichkeit [New Objectivity]. Their students, [[Andreas Gursky]], Candida H\u00f6fer, Thomas Ruff and Thomas Struth modified the approach by applying new technical possibilities and contemporary vision. These movements combined with the influence of the Icelandic minimalism and artists like Donald Judd, played a pivotal role in understanding the roots of the Helsinki School.\n\nThe Helsinki School was based upon a Professional Studies program that was unique in how it used its academic platform to create an environment that blended its teachers, students and former graduates together in a contextual dialogue through group exhibitions, publications and the utilization of the international art fairs as a means for teaching, referencing and presenting these artists\u2019 works to the international community. \nThis collective dialogue is one of the cornerstones the Helsinki School\u2019s concept was built upon. It's grounded on an approach that introduces the students in how to use criticism as a positive tool. This places the emphasis more on how to find solutions rather than the fear of making mistakes. Due to financial restrictions, common to many universities, Aalto has conceived a system where students teach each other through their shared experiences. A good example of this is in Aalto\u2019s intern program of sending selected students abroad to work in residencies, galleries and other professional platforms.

It is the largest haredi college in [[Israel]], with an undergraduate population of nearly 3,000. It is also the only haredi college that offers courses in Legal Studies.\n\nThe main haredi Campus is in [[Or Yehuda]], and there is an extension in [[Jerusalem]].\n\nThe Haredi Campus - Ono Academic College was the first college for haredim in Israel. The college was established in 2001 by Renan Hartman. In 2003, Rabbi Yehezkel Fogel was appointed chairman of the campus.\n\n== Study tracks ==\nProgram tracks include first degrees in the following subjects: Law (. LL.B), Business Management (. BA, with specializations in accounting, information systems analysis, finance and capital markets, and marketing and management), Occupational Therapy (BOT), communication disorders (. BA), and advertising and marketing communications.\n\n== Campus features ==\nClasses are held in accordance with an [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] lifestyle. There is complete separation between men and women on days of study, and all computer terminals are filtered by \"Grenade Web\". Learning tracks are adjusted to their target audience. In addition, students are required to sign a commitment to haredim, and their attendance is dependent on dressing modestly.\n\n56% of the students are men, of whom 67% are married.
