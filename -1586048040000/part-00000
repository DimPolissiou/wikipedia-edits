The society also was opposed to transferring control of the [[Panama Canal]] from American to Panamanian sovereignty.<ref>{{Cite news | first = Andrew | last = Guthrie | title = Is Panama Canal Falling Under Chinese Control? | url = http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/news/china/1999/991124-prc1.htm | work = Voice of America | date = November 24, 1999 | accessdate = July 25, 2008}}</ref>\n\nIn the 1970s, the John Birch Society played a prominent role in promoting the false claim that [[laetrile]] was a [[cancer cure]], and in advocating for the legalization of the compound as a drug.<ref name=\"Lyons\">Richard D.

Its activities included the distribution of literature critical of civil rights legislation, warnings over the influence of the United Nations, and the release of petitions to impeach United States Supreme Court Justice [[Earl Warren]].

Turning to music, he found enjoyment in the sounds of his African American and Latino neighbors. As a young man, Berns danced in [[Mambo (dance)|mambo]] nightclubs, and made his way to Havana before the Cuban Revolution.<ref name=\"selvin\">{{cite book |last=Selvin |first=Joel |authorlink=Joel Selvin |title=Here Comes the Night: The Dark Soul of Bert Berns and the Dirty Business of Rhythm and Blues |publisher=[[Counterpoint (publisher)|Counterpoint Press]] |year=2014 |isbn=978-1619025417}}</ref>{{rp|23}}\n\n==Music career==\n\n===Beginnings (1960\u20131963)===\nShortly after his return from Cuba, Berns began a seven-year run from an obscure [[Brill Building]] songwriter to owner of his own record labels. He signed as a $50/week songwriter with Robert Mellin Music at 1650 Broadway in 1960. His first hit record was \"[[A Little Bit of Soap]]\", performed by [[the Jarmels]] on Laurie Records in 1961. Berns himself had a short-lived career as a recording artist, and in 1961, under the name \"Russell Byrd\", Berns scored his only [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] appearance with his own composition, \"You'd Better Come Home\", which peaked at Number 50.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.billboard.com/music/russell-byrd|title=Russell Byrd - Chart History|last=|first=|date=|website=Billboard|url-status=live|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180316124141/https://www.billboard.com/music/russell-byrd|archive-date=2018-03-02|access-date=2020-01-22}}</ref> That song would later be recorded by the [[Isley Brothers]], and featured as the B-side of their 1962 single \"Twistin' With Linda\".

Berns also hit the charts in late 1962 with [[the Exciters]]' \"[[Tell Him (Bert Berns song)|Tell Him]]\" on United Artists, and with [[Solomon Burke]]'s \"[[Cry to Me]]\" on [[Atlantic Records]].

''[[Collins English Dictionary]]''.</ref> born 17 August 1926) is a Chinese retired politician who served as [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China]] from 1989 to 2002 as [[Chairman of the Central Military Commission|Chairman of the Central Military Commission of the Communist Party of China]] from 1989 to 2004 and as [[President of the People's Republic of China]] from 1993 to 2003. Jiang has been described as the \"[[leadership core|core]] of the [[Generations of Chinese leadership|third generation]]\" of [[Communist Party of China|Communist Party]] leaders since 1989.\n\nJiang came to power unexpectedly as a 'compromise candidate' following the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]] when he replaced [[Zhao Ziyang]] as [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|General Secretary]] after Zhao was ousted for his support for the student movement. With the waning influence of [[Eight Elders]] due to old age and with the death of [[Deng Xiaoping]] in 1997, Jiang consolidated his hold on power and became the \"[[paramount leader]]\" of the party and the country in the 1990s.\n\nUrged by [[Deng_Xiaoping|Deng's]] southern tour in 1992 to accelerate \"[[Chinese economic reform|opening up and reform]]\", Jiang officially introduced the term \"[[socialist market economy]]\" in his speech during the 14th National Congress of the [[Communist Party of China]] held later that year, ending a period of ideological uncertainty and economic stagnation following [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|1989]]. Under Jiang's leadership, China experienced substantial economic growth with the continuation of [[Chinese economic reform|reforms]], saw the peaceful return of [[transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong|Hong Kong from the United Kingdom]] in 1997 and [[Transfer of sovereignty over Macau|Macau from Portugal]] in 1999 and improved its relations with the outside world while the Communist Party maintained its tight control over the government. His contributions to party doctrine, known as the \"[[Three Represents]],\" were written into the [[Constitution of the Communist Party of China|party's constitution]] in 2002. Jiang vacated the post of party General Secretary and [[Politburo Standing Committee of the Communist Party of China|Politburo Standing Committee]] in 2002, but did not relinquish all of his leadership titles until 2005, and continued to influence affairs until much later. At the age of {{Age in years and days|1926|8|17}}, Jiang is the longest-living [[paramount leader]] in the history of the PRC, surpassing Deng Xiaoping on 14 February 2019.\n\n==Background and ascendancy==\nJiang Zemin was born in the city of [[Yangzhou]], [[Jiangsu]] in 17 August 1926.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BRl1sWYShpcC&pg=RA4-PA339 |title=Events That Formed the Modern World|first1=Frank W.|last1=Thackeray|first2=John E.|last2=Findling|date=31 May 2012|publisher=ABC-CLIO|via=Google Books|isbn=9781598849011}}</ref> His ancestral home was the Jiang Village ({{zh|labels=no|\u6c5f\u6751}}) in [[Jingde County]], [[Anhui]]. This was also the hometown of a number of prominent figures in Chinese academic and intellectual establishments. Jiang grew up during the years of [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Japanese occupation]]. His uncle, also his foster father, Jiang Shangqing, died fighting the Japanese in [[World War II]] and is considered in Jiang Zemin's time to be a national hero. Since Shangqing had no heirs, Shangqing's elder brother, Jiang's biological father Jiang Shijun, the vice officer of the publicity department of Japanese-ruled Nanjing government, let Jiang become the adopted son of Shangqing's wife, his aunt, Wang Zhelan, whom he referred to as \"Ni\u00e1ng\" ({{zh|c=\u5a18 |l=Mom}}).\n\n[[File:JZM1947.jpg|thumb|130px|left|Graduation photo of Jiang, taken in 1947.]]\nJiang attended the Department of Electrical Engineering at the [[National Central University]] in Japanese-occupied [[Nanjing]] before transferring to National Chiao Tung University (now [[Shanghai Jiao Tong University]]).

He also worked for Changchun's [[First Automobile Works]]. He was eventually transferred to government services, where he began to rise in prominence and rank, eventually becoming a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party, Minister of Electronic Industries in 1983.\n\nIn 1985 he became Mayor of Shanghai, and subsequently the [[Party chief of the Communist Party of China|Party Secretary of Shanghai]]. Jiang received mixed reviews as mayor. Many of his critics dismissed him as a \"flower pot\", a Chinese term for someone who only seems useful, but actually gets nothing done.<ref name=\"BBC: Profile: Jiang Zemin\">{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/1832448.stm |title=BBC: Profile: Jiang Zemin |work=BBC News |date=19 September 2004 |accessdate=7 March 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080529080200/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/asia-pacific/1832448.stm |archive-date=29 May 2008 |url-status=live }}</ref> Many credited Shanghai's growth during the period to [[Zhu Rongji]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1993-07-31/news/mn-18906_1_zhu-rongji|title=China Leans Heavily on Trouble-Shooter : Politics: Vice Premier Zhu Rongji's assignment is to cope with economic troubles, corruption, rural anger.|first=DAVID|last=HOLLEY|date=31 July 1993|publisher=|via=LA Times|access-date=5 December 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140715000828/http://articles.latimes.com/1993-07-31/news/mn-18906_1_zhu-rongji|archive-date=15 July 2014|url-status=live}}</ref> Jiang was an ardent believer, during this period, in [[Deng Xiaoping]]'s economic reforms.

In 1989, China was in crisis over the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|Tiananmen Square protest]], and the central government was in conflict on how to handle the protesters. In June, Deng Xiaoping dismissed liberal [[Zhao Ziyang]], who was considered to be too conciliatory toward the student protestors. At the time, Jiang was the [[Politics of Shanghai|Shanghai Party secretary]], the top figure in China's new economic center. In an incident with the ''[[World Economic Herald]]'', Jiang closed down the newspaper, deeming it to be harmful. The handling of the crisis in Shanghai was noticed by Beijing, and then by paramount leader Deng Xiaoping. As the protests escalated and then Party general secretary [[Zhao Ziyang]] was removed from office, Jiang was selected by the Party leaders as a compromise candidate over [[Tianjin]]'s [[Li Ruihuan]], Premier [[Li Peng]], [[Li Xiannian]], [[Chen Yun]], and the retired elders to become the new General Secretary. Before that, he had been considered to be an unlikely candidate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/world/2004-09-19-china-military_x.htm|title=USATODAY.com - China completes military power transfer|website=usatoday30.usatoday.com|access-date=5 December 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121102160834/http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/world/2004-09-19-china-military_x.htm|archive-date=2 November 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> Within three years, Deng had transferred most power in the state, party and military to Jiang.\n\n==Early leadership==\nJiang was elevated to the country's top job in 1989 with a fairly small power base inside the party, and thus, very little actual power.<ref name=\"auto\"/> His most reliable allies were the powerful party elders \u2013 [[Chen Yun]] and [[Li Xiannian]]. He was believed to be simply a transitional figure until a more stable successor government to Deng could be put in place. Other prominent Party and military figures like [[Yang Shangkun]] and his brother [[Yang Baibing]] were believed to be planning a coup. Jiang used Deng Xiaoping as a back-up to his leadership in the first few years. Jiang, who was believed<ref>{{cite journal|title=Overlapping Transitions in China's Leadership|first=Lyman|last=Miller|date=1 June 1996|journal=SAIS Review|volume=16|issue=2|pages=21\u201342|doi=10.1353/sais.1996.0038}}</ref> to have a neo-conservative slant, warned against \"bourgeois liberalization\". Deng's belief, however, stipulated that the only solution to keeping the legitimacy of Communist rule over China was to continue the drive for modernization and economic reform, and therefore placed himself at odds with Jiang.\n\nAt the first meeting of the new [[Politburo Standing Committee of the Communist Party of China|Politburo Standing Committee]], after the Tiananmen Square massacre of 1989, Jiang criticized the previous period as \"hard on the economy, soft on politics\" and advocated increasing political thought work.<ref name=brady08>Anne-Marie Brady, Marketing Dictatorship: Propaganda and Thought Work in Contemporary China, Rowman & Littlefield Publishers, Inc.</ref> [[Anne-Marie Brady]] wrote that \"Jiang Zemin was a long time political cadre with a nose for ideological work and its importance. This meeting marked the beginning of a new era in propaganda and political thought work in China.\" Soon after, the Central Propaganda Department was given more resources and power, \"including the power to go in to the propaganda-related work units and cleanse the ranks of those who had been supportive of the democracy movement.\"<ref name=brady08 />\n\nDeng grew critical of Jiang's leadership in 1992. During Deng's southern tours, he subtly suggested that the pace of reform was not fast enough, and the \"central leadership\" (i.e. Jiang) had most responsibility. Jiang grew ever more cautious, and rallied behind Deng's reforms completely. In 1993, Jiang coined the new \"[[socialist market economy]]\" to move China's centrally-planned socialist economy into essentially a government-regulated capitalist [[market economy]]. It was a huge step to take in the realization of Deng's \"Socialism with Chinese characteristics\". At the same time, Jiang elevated many of his supporters from Shanghai to high government positions, after regaining Deng's confidence. He abolished the outdated [[Central Advisory Committee]], an advisory body composed of revolutionary party elders. He became [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China]] and [[Chairman of the Central Military Commission]] in 1989, followed by his election to the [[President of the People's Republic of China|Presidency]] in March 1993.\n\n==Paramount leader==\nIn the early 1990s, post-Tiananmen economic reforms had stabilized and the country was on a consistent growth trajectory. At the same time, China faced a myriad of economic and social problems. At Deng's state funeral in 1997, Jiang delivered the elder statesman's eulogy. Jiang had inherited a China rampant with political corruption, and regional economies growing too rapidly for the stability of the entire country. Deng's policy that \"some areas can get rich before others\" led to an opening wealth gap between coastal regions and the interior provinces. The unprecedented economic growth and the deregulation in a number of heavy industries led to the closing of many [[state-owned enterprise]]s (SOEs), breaking the [[iron rice bowl]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1997-sep-13-mn-31787-story.html|title=China Gets Down to Business at Party Congress|date=1997-09-13|website=Los Angeles Times|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-12}}</ref>\n\nAs a result, unemployment rates skyrocketed, rising as high as 40% in some urban areas. [[Stock market]]s fluctuated greatly. The scale of rural migration into urban areas was unprecedented anywhere, and little was being done to address an ever-increasing urban-rural wealth gap.

Beginning in 1996, Jiang began a series of reforms in the state-controlled media aimed at promoting the \"core of leadership\" under himself, and at the same time crushing some of his political opponents. The personality enhancements in the media were largely frowned upon during the Deng era, and had not been seen since the Mao era in the late 1970s.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n\nThe ''[[People's Daily]]'' and [[China Central Television|CCTV]]-1's 7 pm ''[[Xinwen Lianbo]]'' each had Jiang-related events as the front-page or top stories, a fact that remained until Hu Jintao's media administrative changes in 2006. Jiang appeared casual in front of Western media, and gave an unprecedented interview with [[Mike Wallace]] of CBS in 2000 at [[Beidaihe]]. He would often use foreign languages in front of the camera, albeit not always fluently. In an encounter with a Hong Kong reporter in 2000 regarding the central government's apparent \"imperial order\" of supporting [[Tung Chee-hwa]] to seek a second term as [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong]], Jiang scolded the Hong Kong journalists as \"too simple, sometimes naive\" in English.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hkja.org.hk/site/portal/Site.aspx?id=A1-629|title=Hong Kong Journalists Association: FOE Annual Report, 2001|date=9 August 2001|accessdate=11 October 2014|website=Hong Kong Journalists Association|archivedate=11 October 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141011095132/http://www.hkja.org.hk/site/portal/Site.aspx?id=A1-629}}</ref> The event was shown on Hong Kong television that night.\n\n===Crackdown on the Falun Gong===\nIn June 1999, Jiang established an extralegal department, the [[610 Office|6-10 Office]], to crack down on the [[Falun Gong]].

He made a speech at Harvard University, part of it in English, but could not escape questions on democracy and freedom. In the official summit meeting with US President [[Bill Clinton]], the tone was relaxed as Jiang and Clinton sought common ground while largely ignoring areas of disagreement.

Despite this, there were at least three serious flare-ups between China and the US during Jiang's tenure: the [[Third Taiwan Strait Crisis]] in 1996, the NATO bombing of Serbia, and the [[Hainan Island incident]] in April 2001.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\n===Economic development===\nJiang did not specialize in economics, and in 1997 handed most of the economic governance of the country to [[Zhu Rongji]], who became [[Premier of the State Council|Premier]], and remained in office through the [[Asian financial crisis]]. Under their joint leadership, [[Mainland China]] has sustained an average of 8% GDP growth annually, achieving the highest rate of per capita economic growth in major world economies, raising eyebrows around the world with its astonishing speed. This was mostly achieved by continuing the process of a transition to a market economy.

Bush]] with wife in [[Crawford, Texas]], 25 October 2002.]]\nIn 2002, Jiang stepped down from the powerful [[Politburo Standing Committee]] and as General Secretary to make way for a \"fourth generation\" of leadership headed by [[Hu Jintao]], beginning a transition of power that would last several years. Hu assumed Jiang's title as party head, becoming the new [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China]]. At the 16th Party Congress held in the autumn of 2002, observers noted at the time that six out of the nine new members of Standing Committee were considered part of Jiang's so-called \"[[Shanghai Clique]]\", the most prominent being Vice President [[Zeng Qinghong]], who had served as Jiang's chief of staff for many years, and Vice Premier [[Huang Ju]], a former party chief of [[Shanghai]].\n\nAlthough Jiang retained the chairmanship of the powerful [[Central Military Commission]], most members of the commission were professional military men. ''Liberation Army Daily'', a publication thought to represent the views of the CMC majority, printed an article on 11 March 2003 which quotes two army delegates as saying, \"Having one center is called 'loyalty', while having two centers will result in 'problems.'\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://media.hoover.org/documents/clm7_jm.pdf|title=Reduced Budgets, the \"Two Centers,\" and Other Mysteries of the 2003 National People's Congress|author=James Mulvenon|website=Media.hoover.org|accessdate=14 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080626175840/http://media.hoover.org/documents/clm7_jm.pdf|archive-date=26 June 2008|url-status=live}}</ref> This was widely interpreted as a criticism of Jiang's attempt to exercise dual leadership with Hu on the model of Deng Xiaoping.\n\nHu succeeded Jiang as party leader in November 2002. To the surprise of many observers, evidence of Jiang's continuing influence on public policy abruptly disappeared from the official media. Jiang was conspicuously silent during the [[SARS]] crisis, especially when compared to the very public profile of Hu and the newly anointed Premier, [[Wen Jiabao]]. It has been argued that the institutional arrangements created by the 16th Congress have left Jiang in a position where he cannot exercise much influence.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cecc.gov/publications/issue-papers/information-control-and-self-censorship-in-the-prc-and-the-spread-of-sars|title=Information Control and Self-Censorship in the PRC and the Spread of SARS - Congressional-Executive Commission on China|website=www.cecc.gov}}</ref> Although many of the members of the Politburo Standing Committee were associated with him, the Standing Committee does not necessarily have command authority over the civilian bureaucracy.\n\nOn 19 September 2004, after a four-day meeting of the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of China|Central Committee]], Jiang relinquished his post as chairman of the party's Central Military Commission, his last post in the party. Six months later he resigned his last significant post, chairman of the Central Military Commission of the state.  This followed weeks of speculation that forces inside the party were pressing Jiang to step aside. Jiang's term was supposed to have lasted until 2007. Hu also succeeded Jiang as the CMC chairman, but, in an apparent political defeat for Jiang, General [[Xu Caihou]], and not Zeng Qinghong was appointed to succeed Hu as vice chairman, as was initially speculated. This power transition formally marked the end of Jiang's era in China, which roughly lasted from 1993 to 2004.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://journals.sub.uni-hamburg.de/giga/files/journals/3/articles/61/public/61-61-1-PB.pdf|title=China's Foreign- and Security-policy Decision-making Processes under Hu Jintao|first=Jean-Pierre|last=Cabestan|date=8 October 2009|journal=Journal of Current Chinese Affairs|volume=38|issue=3|access-date=6 December 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212083814/http://journals.sub.uni-hamburg.de/giga/files/journals/3/articles/61/public/61-61-1-PB.pdf|archive-date=12 December 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Official appearances after retirement===\nJiang continued to make official appearances after giving up his last title in 2004.

Following the Tiananmen protests, Jiang threw his support behind elder [[Chen Yun]]'s conservative economic policies, but subsequently changed his allegiance to Deng Xiaoping's reform-oriented agenda following the latter's \"Southern Tour\". This shift was not only seen as the exercise of a political opportunist, it also sowed confusion among party loyalists in regards to what direction the party was headed or what the party truly believed in.<ref name=miles>{{cite book|last1=Miles|first1=James A.

This opened the way for the sub-optimal distribution of the fruits of growth, and an expanding culture of corruption among bureaucrats and party officials.<ref name=tairenxing/>\n\nHistorian and former Xinhua journalist [[Yang Jisheng (historian)|Yang Jisheng]] wrote that Jiang may well have been given a positive historical assessment had it not been for his decision to 'overstay his welcome' by remaining in the Central Military Commission post after Hu had formally assumed the party leadership.  Moreover, Jiang took credit for all the gains made during the 13 years \"between 1989 and 2002,\" which not only evoked the memories of Jiang being a beneficiary of Tiananmen, but also neglected the economic foundations laid by Deng, whose authority was still paramount until the mid-1990s.  Additionally, Jiang was also criticized for his insistence on writing the \"Three Represents\" into the party and state constitutions (see below), which Yang called Jiang's attempt at \"self-deification\", i.e., that he saw himself as a visionary along the same lines as Deng and Mao. Yang contended, \"The 'Three Represents' is just common sense. It is not a proper theoretical framework.

However, the theory lacked staying power. By the time of the 17th Party Congress in 2007, the [[Scientific Outlook on Development]] had already been written into the constitution of the Communist Party, a mere five years after the Three Represents, overtaking the latter as the guiding ideology for much of [[Hu Jintao]]'s term. While his successors paid lip service to \"Three Represents\" in official party documentation and speeches, no special emphasis was placed on the theory after Jiang left office. There was even speculation following Xi Jinping's assumption of power in 2012 that the Three Represents would eventually be dropped from the party's list of guiding ideologies.<ref name=datong/>\n\nThe Three Represents justified the incorporation of the new capitalist business class into the party, and changed the founding ideology of the Communist Party of China from protecting the interests of the peasantry and workers to that of the \"overwhelming majority of the people\", a euphemism aimed at placating the growing entrepreneurial class. Conservative critics within the party, such as hardline leftist [[Deng Liqun]], denounced this as betrayal of \"true\" communist ideology.<ref name=datong>{{cite news|language=zh-cn |script-title=zh:\u8865\u7262\u610f\u8bc6\u5f62\u6001 \"\u5927\u7edf\u6218\"\u4fee\u6b63\u4e09\u4e2a\u4ee3\u8868\uff1f|url=http://china.dwnews.com/news/2015-06-06/59658666.html|work=Duowei News|date=6 June 2015|access-date=22 June 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150622201700/http://china.dwnews.com/news/2015-06-06/59658666.html|archive-date=22 June 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Other areas===\nSome have also associated Jiang with the widespread corruption and cronyism that had become a notable feature of the Communist power apparatus since Jiang's years in power.

A lack of checks and balances in the cadre promotion system also meant that personal loyalty often trumped skill and merit in ensuring advancement.

Prominent examples often cited include Jiang's former secretary [[Jia Ting'an]] and Shanghai clique member [[Huang Ju]].\n\nAt the same time, many biographers of Jiang have noted his government resembled an oligarchy as opposed to an autocratic dictatorship.<ref>Kuhn, 2004; Lam, 1997</ref> Many of the policies of his era had been attributed to others in government, notably Premier [[Zhu Rongji]].

''[[Collins English Dictionary]]''.</ref> born 17 August 1926) is a Chinese retired politician who served as [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China]] from 1989 to 2002 as [[Chairman of the Central Military Commission|Chairman of the Central Military Commission of the Communist Party of China]] from 1989 to 2004 and as [[President of the People's Republic of China]] from 1993 to 2003. Jiang has been described as the \"[[leadership core|core]] of the [[Generations of Chinese leadership|third generation]]\" of [[Communist Party of China|Communist Party]] leaders since 1989.\n\nJiang came to power unexpectedly as a 'compromise candidate' following the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989]] when he replaced [[Zhao Ziyang]] as [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China|General Secretary]] after Zhao was ousted for his support for the student movement. With the waning influence of [[Eight Elders]] due to old age and with the death of [[Deng Xiaoping]] in 1997, Jiang consolidated his hold on power and became the \"[[paramount leader]]\" of the party and the country in the 1990s.\n\nUrged by Deng's southern tour in 1992 to accelerate \"[[Chinese economic reform|opening up and reform]]\", Jiang officially introduced the term \"[[socialist market economy]]\" in his speech during the 14th National Congress of the [[Communist Party of China]] held later that year, ending a period of ideological uncertainty and economic stagnation following [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|1989]]. Under Jiang's leadership, China experienced substantial economic growth with the continuation of [[Chinese economic reform|reforms]], saw the peaceful return of [[transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong|Hong Kong from the United Kingdom]] in 1997 and [[Transfer of sovereignty over Macau|Macau from Portugal]] in 1999 and improved its relations with the outside world while the Communist Party maintained its tight control over the government. His contributions to party doctrine, known as the \"[[Three Represents]],\" were written into the [[Constitution of the Communist Party of China|party's constitution]] in 2002. Jiang vacated the post of party General Secretary and [[Politburo Standing Committee of the Communist Party of China|Politburo Standing Committee]] in 2002, but did not relinquish all of his leadership titles until 2005, and continued to influence affairs until much later. At the age of {{Age in years and days|1926|8|17}}, Jiang is the longest-living [[paramount leader]] in the history of the PRC, surpassing Deng Xiaoping on 14 February 2019.\n\n==Background and ascendancy==\nJiang Zemin was born in the city of [[Yangzhou]], [[Jiangsu]] in 17 August 1926.<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BRl1sWYShpcC&pg=RA4-PA339 |title=Events That Formed the Modern World|first1=Frank W.|last1=Thackeray|first2=John E.|last2=Findling|date=31 May 2012|publisher=ABC-CLIO|via=Google Books|isbn=9781598849011}}</ref> His ancestral home was the Jiang Village ({{zh|labels=no|\u6c5f\u6751}}) in [[Jingde County]], [[Anhui]]. This was also the hometown of a number of prominent figures in Chinese academic and intellectual establishments. Jiang grew up during the years of [[Second Sino-Japanese War|Japanese occupation]]. His uncle, also his foster father, Jiang Shangqing, died fighting the Japanese in [[World War II]] and is considered in Jiang Zemin's time to be a national hero. Since Shangqing had no heirs, Shangqing's elder brother, Jiang's biological father Jiang Shijun, the vice officer of the publicity department of Japanese-ruled Nanjing government, let Jiang become the adopted son of Shangqing's wife, his aunt, Wang Zhelan, whom he referred to as \"Ni\u00e1ng\" ({{zh|c=\u5a18 |l=Mom}}).\n\n[[File:JZM1947.jpg|thumb|130px|left|Graduation photo of Jiang, taken in 1947.]]\nJiang attended the Department of Electrical Engineering at the [[National Central University]] in Japanese-occupied [[Nanjing]] before transferring to National Chiao Tung University (now [[Shanghai Jiao Tong University]]).

He also worked for Changchun's [[First Automobile Works]]. He was eventually transferred to government services, where he began to rise in prominence and rank, eventually becoming a member of the Central Committee of the Communist Party, Minister of Electronic Industries in 1983.\n\nIn 1985 he became Mayor of Shanghai, and subsequently the [[Party chief of the Communist Party of China|Party Secretary of Shanghai]]. Jiang received mixed reviews as mayor.

In 1989, China was in crisis over the [[Tiananmen Square protests of 1989|Tiananmen Square protest]], and the central government was in conflict on how to handle the protesters. In June, Deng Xiaoping dismissed liberal [[Zhao Ziyang]], who was considered to be too conciliatory toward the student protestors. At the time, Jiang was the [[Politics of Shanghai|Shanghai Party secretary]], the top figure in China's new economic center. In an incident with the ''[[World Economic Herald]]'', Jiang closed down the newspaper, deeming it to be harmful. The handling of the crisis in Shanghai was noticed by Beijing, and then by paramount leader Deng Xiaoping. As the protests escalated and then Party general secretary [[Zhao Ziyang]] was removed from office, Jiang was selected by the Party leaders as a compromise candidate over [[Tianjin]]'s [[Li Ruihuan]], Premier [[Li Peng]], [[Li Xiannian]], [[Chen Yun]], and the retired elders to become the new General Secretary. Before that, he had been considered to be an unlikely candidate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/world/2004-09-19-china-military_x.htm|title=USATODAY.com - China completes military power transfer|website=usatoday30.usatoday.com|access-date=5 December 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121102160834/http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/world/2004-09-19-china-military_x.htm|archive-date=2 November 2012|url-status=live}}</ref> Within three years, Deng had transferred most power in the state, party and military to Jiang.\n\n==Early leadership==\nJiang was elevated to the country's top job in 1989 with a fairly small power base inside the party, and thus, very little actual power.<ref name=\"auto\"/> His most reliable allies were the powerful party elders \u2013 [[Chen Yun]] and [[Li Xiannian]]. He was believed to be simply a transitional figure until a more stable successor government to Deng could be put in place.

Jiang used Deng Xiaoping as a back-up to his leadership in the first few years. Jiang, who was believed<ref>{{cite journal|title=Overlapping Transitions in China's Leadership|first=Lyman|last=Miller|date=1 June 1996|journal=SAIS Review|volume=16|issue=2|pages=21\u201342|doi=10.1353/sais.1996.0038}}</ref> to have a neo-conservative slant, warned against \"bourgeois liberalization\". Deng's belief, however, stipulated that the only solution to keeping the legitimacy of Communist rule over China was to continue the drive for modernization and economic reform, and therefore placed himself at odds with Jiang.\n\nAt the first meeting of the new [[Politburo Standing Committee of the Communist Party of China|Politburo Standing Committee]], after the Tiananmen Square massacre of 1989, Jiang criticized the previous period as \"hard on the economy, soft on politics\" and advocated increasing political thought work.<ref name=brady08>Anne-Marie Brady, Marketing Dictatorship: Propaganda and Thought Work in Contemporary China, Rowman & Littlefield Publishers, Inc.</ref> [[Anne-Marie Brady]] wrote that \"Jiang Zemin was a long time political cadre with a nose for ideological work and its importance. This meeting marked the beginning of a new era in propaganda and political thought work in China.\" Soon after, the Central Propaganda Department was given more resources and power, \"including the power to go in to the propaganda-related work units and cleanse the ranks of those who had been supportive of the democracy movement.\"<ref name=brady08 />\n\nDeng grew critical of Jiang's leadership in 1992. During Deng's southern tours, he subtly suggested that the pace of reform was not fast enough, and the \"central leadership\" (i.e. Jiang) had most responsibility. Jiang grew ever more cautious, and rallied behind Deng's reforms completely. In 1993, Jiang coined the new \"[[socialist market economy]]\" to move China's centrally-planned socialist economy into essentially a government-regulated capitalist [[market economy]]. It was a huge step to take in the realization of Deng's \"Socialism with Chinese characteristics\". At the same time, Jiang elevated many of his supporters from Shanghai to high government positions, after regaining Deng's confidence. He abolished the outdated [[Central Advisory Committee]], an advisory body composed of revolutionary party elders. He became [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China]] and [[Chairman of the Central Military Commission]] in 1989, followed by his election to the [[President of the People's Republic of China|Presidency]] in March 1993.\n\n==Paramount leader==\nIn the early 1990s, post-Tiananmen economic reforms had stabilized and the country was on a consistent growth trajectory. At the same time, China faced a myriad of economic and social problems. At Deng's state funeral in 1997, Jiang delivered the elder statesman's eulogy. Jiang had inherited a China rampant with political corruption, and regional economies growing too rapidly for the stability of the entire country. Deng's policy that \"some areas can get rich before others\" led to an opening wealth gap between coastal regions and the interior provinces. The unprecedented economic growth and the deregulation in a number of heavy industries led to the closing of many [[state-owned enterprise]]s (SOEs), breaking the [[iron rice bowl]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-1997-sep-13-mn-31787-story.html|title=China Gets Down to Business at Party Congress|date=1997-09-13|website=Los Angeles Times|language=en-US|access-date=2020-01-12}}</ref>\n\nAs a result, unemployment rates skyrocketed, rising as high as 40% in some urban areas.

Beginning in 1996, Jiang began a series of reforms in the state-controlled media aimed at promoting the \"core of leadership\" under himself, and at the same time crushing some of his political opponents. The personality enhancements in the media were largely frowned upon during the Deng era, and had not been seen since the Mao era in the late 1970s.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}\n\nThe ''[[People's Daily]]'' and [[China Central Television|CCTV]]-1's 7 pm ''[[Xinwen Lianbo]]'' each had Jiang-related events as the front-page or top stories, a fact that remained until Hu Jintao's media administrative changes in 2006. Jiang appeared casual in front of Western media, and gave an unprecedented interview with [[Mike Wallace]] of CBS in 2000 at [[Beidaihe]]. He would often use foreign languages in front of the camera, albeit not always fluently. In an encounter with a Hong Kong reporter in 2000 regarding the central government's apparent \"imperial order\" of supporting [[Tung Chee-hwa]] to seek a second term as [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong]], Jiang scolded the Hong Kong journalists as \"too simple, sometimes naive\" in English.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.hkja.org.hk/site/portal/Site.aspx?id=A1-629|title=Hong Kong Journalists Association: FOE Annual Report, 2001|date=9 August 2001|accessdate=11 October 2014|website=Hong Kong Journalists Association|archivedate=11 October 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141011095132/http://www.hkja.org.hk/site/portal/Site.aspx?id=A1-629}}</ref> The event was shown on Hong Kong television that night.\n\n===Crackdown on the Falun Gong===\nIn June 1999, Jiang established an extralegal department, the [[610 Office|6-10 Office]], to crack down on the [[Falun Gong]].

He made a speech at Harvard University, part of it in English, but could not escape questions on democracy and freedom. In the official summit meeting with US President [[Bill Clinton]], the tone was relaxed as Jiang and Clinton sought common ground while largely ignoring areas of disagreement. Clinton would visit China in June 1998, and vowed that China and the United States were partners in the world, and not adversaries. When American-led [[NATO Bombing of the Chinese embassy in Belgrade|NATO bombed the Chinese Embassy in Belgrade]] in 1999, Jiang seemed to have put up a harsh stance for show at home, but in reality only performed symbolic gestures of protest, and no solid action.<ref name=\"BBC\"/> Jiang's foreign policy was for the most part passive and non-confrontational.

Despite this, there were at least three serious flare-ups between China and the US during Jiang's tenure: the [[Third Taiwan Strait Crisis]] in 1996, the NATO bombing of Serbia, and the [[Hainan Island incident]] in April 2001.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\n===Economic development===\nJiang did not specialize in economics, and in 1997 handed most of the economic governance of the country to [[Zhu Rongji]], who became [[Premier of the State Council|Premier]], and remained in office through the [[Asian financial crisis]]. Under their joint leadership, [[Mainland China]] has sustained an average of 8% GDP growth annually, achieving the highest rate of per capita economic growth in major world economies, raising eyebrows around the world with its astonishing speed. This was mostly achieved by continuing the process of a transition to a market economy. Strong party control over China was cemented by the PRC's successful bid to join the [[World Trade Organization]] and Beijing winning the bid to host the [[2008 Summer Olympics]].{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\n===Three Represents===\n{{main|Ideology of the Communist Party of China}}\nBefore he transferred power to a younger generation of leaders, Jiang had his theory of [[Three Represents]] written into the Party's constitution, alongside [[Marxism\u2013Leninism]], [[Maoism|Mao Zedong Thought]], and [[Deng Xiaoping Theory]] at the 16th CPC Congress in 2002.<ref>Tomoyuki Kojima.

Largely speculated to step down from all positions by international media, his rival [[Li Ruihuan]]'s resignation in 2002 prompted analysts to rethink Jiang. The theory of Three Represents was believed by many political analysts to be Jiang's effort at extending his vision to Marxist\u2013Leninist principles, and therefore elevating himself alongside previous Chinese Marxist philosophers Mao and Deng.\n\n==Gradual retirement==\n{{see also|Shanghai clique}}\n[[File:jiang zemin with wife bush with laura.jpg|thumb|left|Jiang Zemin with wife and [[George W. Bush]] with wife in [[Crawford, Texas]], 25 October 2002.]]\nIn 2002, Jiang stepped down from the powerful [[Politburo Standing Committee]] and as General Secretary to make way for a \"fourth generation\" of leadership headed by [[Hu Jintao]], beginning a transition of power that would last several years. Hu assumed Jiang's title as party head, becoming the new [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of China]]. At the 16th Party Congress held in the autumn of 2002, observers noted at the time that six out of the nine new members of Standing Committee were considered part of Jiang's so-called \"[[Shanghai Clique]]\", the most prominent being Vice President [[Zeng Qinghong]], who had served as Jiang's chief of staff for many years, and Vice Premier [[Huang Ju]], a former party chief of [[Shanghai]].\n\nAlthough Jiang retained the chairmanship of the powerful [[Central Military Commission]], most members of the commission were professional military men. ''Liberation Army Daily'', a publication thought to represent the views of the CMC majority, printed an article on 11 March 2003 which quotes two army delegates as saying, \"Having one center is called 'loyalty', while having two centers will result in 'problems.'\"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://media.hoover.org/documents/clm7_jm.pdf|title=Reduced Budgets, the \"Two Centers,\" and Other Mysteries of the 2003 National People's Congress|author=James Mulvenon|website=Media.hoover.org|accessdate=14 November 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080626175840/http://media.hoover.org/documents/clm7_jm.pdf|archive-date=26 June 2008|url-status=live}}</ref> This was widely interpreted as a criticism of Jiang's attempt to exercise dual leadership with Hu on the model of Deng Xiaoping.\n\nHu succeeded Jiang as party leader in November 2002. To the surprise of many observers, evidence of Jiang's continuing influence on public policy abruptly disappeared from the official media. Jiang was conspicuously silent during the [[SARS]] crisis, especially when compared to the very public profile of Hu and the newly anointed Premier, [[Wen Jiabao]]. It has been argued that the institutional arrangements created by the 16th Congress have left Jiang in a position where he cannot exercise much influence.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cecc.gov/publications/issue-papers/information-control-and-self-censorship-in-the-prc-and-the-spread-of-sars|title=Information Control and Self-Censorship in the PRC and the Spread of SARS - Congressional-Executive Commission on China|website=www.cecc.gov}}</ref> Although many of the members of the Politburo Standing Committee were associated with him, the Standing Committee does not necessarily have command authority over the civilian bureaucracy.\n\nOn 19 September 2004, after a four-day meeting of the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of China|Central Committee]], Jiang relinquished his post as chairman of the party's Central Military Commission, his last post in the party. Six months later he resigned his last significant post, chairman of the Central Military Commission of the state.  This followed weeks of speculation that forces inside the party were pressing Jiang to step aside. Jiang's term was supposed to have lasted until 2007. Hu also succeeded Jiang as the CMC chairman, but, in an apparent political defeat for Jiang, General [[Xu Caihou]], and not Zeng Qinghong was appointed to succeed Hu as vice chairman, as was initially speculated. This power transition formally marked the end of Jiang's era in China, which roughly lasted from 1993 to 2004.<ref>{{cite journal|url=http://journals.sub.uni-hamburg.de/giga/files/journals/3/articles/61/public/61-61-1-PB.pdf|title=China's Foreign- and Security-policy Decision-making Processes under Hu Jintao|first=Jean-Pierre|last=Cabestan|date=8 October 2009|journal=Journal of Current Chinese Affairs|volume=38|issue=3|access-date=6 December 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212083814/http://journals.sub.uni-hamburg.de/giga/files/journals/3/articles/61/public/61-61-1-PB.pdf|archive-date=12 December 2013|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Official appearances after retirement===\nJiang continued to make official appearances after giving up his last title in 2004.

Following the Tiananmen protests, Jiang threw his support behind elder [[Chen Yun]]'s conservative economic policies, but subsequently changed his allegiance to Deng Xiaoping's reform-oriented agenda following the latter's \"Southern Tour\". This shift was not only seen as the exercise of a political opportunist, it also sowed confusion among party loyalists in regards to what direction the party was headed or what the party truly believed in.<ref name=miles>{{cite book|last1=Miles|first1=James A.

This opened the way for the sub-optimal distribution of the fruits of growth, and an expanding culture of corruption among bureaucrats and party officials.<ref name=tairenxing/>\n\nHistorian and former Xinhua journalist [[Yang Jisheng (historian)|Yang Jisheng]] wrote that Jiang may well have been given a positive historical assessment had it not been for his decision to 'overstay his welcome' by remaining in the Central Military Commission post after Hu had formally assumed the party leadership.  Moreover, Jiang took credit for all the gains made during the 13 years \"between 1989 and 2002,\" which not only evoked the memories of Jiang being a beneficiary of Tiananmen, but also neglected the economic foundations laid by Deng, whose authority was still paramount until the mid-1990s.  Additionally, Jiang was also criticized for his insistence on writing the \"Three Represents\" into the party and state constitutions (see below), which Yang called Jiang's attempt at \"self-deification\", i.e., that he saw himself as a visionary along the same lines as Deng and Mao. Yang contended, \"The 'Three Represents' is just common sense. It is not a proper theoretical framework. It's what any ruler would tell the people to justify the continued rule of the governing party.\"<ref name=jisheng>{{cite news|language=zh-cn |script-title=zh:\u6768\u7ee7\u7ef3\uff1a\u6c5f\u6cfd\u6c11\u4e09\u4ef6\u8822\u4e8b\u58f0\u671b\u5927\u5927\u4e0b\u964d|url=http://history.dwnews.com/news/2015-06-20/59661964.html|work=Duowei News|date=20 June 2015|access-date=22 June 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150622210632/http://history.dwnews.com/news/2015-06-20/59661964.html|archive-date=22 June 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===\"Three Represents\"===\nFormally, Jiang's theory of \"[[Three Represents]]\" was enshrined in both Party and State constitutions as an \"important thought,\" following in the footsteps of [[Marxism-Leninism]], [[Mao Zedong Thought]] and [[Deng Xiaoping Theory]]. However, the theory lacked staying power. By the time of the 17th Party Congress in 2007, the [[Scientific Outlook on Development]] had already been written into the constitution of the Communist Party, a mere five years after the Three Represents, overtaking the latter as the guiding ideology for much of [[Hu Jintao]]'s term. While his successors paid lip service to \"Three Represents\" in official party documentation and speeches, no special emphasis was placed on the theory after Jiang left office. There was even speculation following Xi Jinping's assumption of power in 2012 that the Three Represents would eventually be dropped from the party's list of guiding ideologies.<ref name=datong/>\n\nThe Three Represents justified the incorporation of the new capitalist business class into the party, and changed the founding ideology of the Communist Party of China from protecting the interests of the peasantry and workers to that of the \"overwhelming majority of the people\", a euphemism aimed at placating the growing entrepreneurial class. Conservative critics within the party, such as hardline leftist [[Deng Liqun]], denounced this as betrayal of \"true\" communist ideology.<ref name=datong>{{cite news|language=zh-cn |script-title=zh:\u8865\u7262\u610f\u8bc6\u5f62\u6001 \"\u5927\u7edf\u6218\"\u4fee\u6b63\u4e09\u4e2a\u4ee3\u8868\uff1f|url=http://china.dwnews.com/news/2015-06-06/59658666.html|work=Duowei News|date=6 June 2015|access-date=22 June 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150622201700/http://china.dwnews.com/news/2015-06-06/59658666.html|archive-date=22 June 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\n===Other areas===\nSome have also associated Jiang with the widespread corruption and cronyism that had become a notable feature of the Communist power apparatus since Jiang's years in power. In the military, the two vice-chairmen who sat atop the Central Military Commission hierarchy &ndash; nominally as assistants to then Chairman [[Hu Jintao]] &ndash; Vice-Chairmen [[Xu Caihou]] and [[Guo Boxiong]], were said to have obstructed Hu Jintao's exercise of power in the military.  Xu and Guo were characterized as \"Jiang's proxies in the military.\"  Eventually, both men were reported to have taken massive bribes, and both fell under the axe of the [[anti-corruption campaign under Xi Jinping]].<ref name=weakgrip>{{cite news|title=Hu Jintao's weak grip on China's army inspired Xi Jinping's military shake-up: sources|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/1734663/hu-jintaos-weak-grip-chinas-army-inspired-president-xi-jinpings-military|work=South China Morning Post|date=11 March 2015|access-date=25 October 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151119195808/http://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/1734663/hu-jintaos-weak-grip-chinas-army-inspired-president-xi-jinpings-military|archive-date=19 November 2015|url-status=live}}</ref>\n\nJiang's time in office also saw a notable increase of collusion between business and political elites.  A lack of checks and balances in the cadre promotion system also meant that personal loyalty often trumped skill and merit in ensuring advancement.  Many people in top ranks of the military and political elites were seen to have gotten to their high positions through securing the patronage of Jiang.  Prominent examples often cited include Jiang's former secretary [[Jia Ting'an]] and Shanghai clique member [[Huang Ju]].\n\nAt the same time, many biographers of Jiang have noted his government resembled an oligarchy as opposed to an autocratic dictatorship.<ref>Kuhn, 2004; Lam, 1997</ref> Many of the policies of his era had been attributed to others in government, notably Premier [[Zhu Rongji]]. Jiang was also characterized as a leader who was mindful to seek the opinion of his close advisers.

They were noticed by scientists investigating [[cathode ray]]s produced by such tubes, which are energetic [[electron]] beams that were first observed in 1869. Many of the early [[Crookes tube]]s (invented around 1875) undoubtedly radiated X-rays, because early researchers noticed effects that were attributable to them, as detailed below. Crookes tubes created free electrons by [[ionization]] of the residual air in the tube by a high DC [[voltage]] of anywhere between a few [[kilovolt]]s and 100 kV. This voltage accelerated the electrons coming from the [[cathode]] to a high enough velocity that they created X-rays when they struck the [[anode]] or the glass wall of the tube.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/npre.2009.3267.5|title=The History, Development and Impact of Computed Imaging in Neurological Diagnosis and Neurosurgery: CT, MRI, and DTI|journal=Nature Precedings|year=2009|last1=Filler|first1=Aaron}}.</ref>\n\nThe earliest experimenter thought to have (unknowingly) produced X-rays was actuary [[William Morgan (actuary)|William Morgan]].

He built a Crookes tube with a \"window\" in the end made of thin aluminum, facing the cathode so the cathode rays would strike it (later called a \"Lenard tube\"). He found that something came through, that would expose photographic plates and cause fluorescence. He measured the penetrating power of these rays through various materials.

This image was used to argue that [[ionizing radiation|radiation exposure]] during the X-ray procedure would be negligible.]]\n\nThe many applications of X-rays immediately generated enormous interest. Workshops began making specialized versions of Crookes tubes for generating X-rays and these first-generation [[cold cathode]] or Crookes X-ray tubes were used until about 1920.\n\nA typical early 20th century medical x-ray system consisted of a [[Induction coil|Ruhmkorff coil]] connected to a [[X-ray_tube#Crookes_tube_(cold_cathode_tube)|cold cathode Crookes X-ray tube]]. A spark gap was typically connected to the high voltage side in parallel to the tube and used for diagnostic purposes.<ref name=\"Scha1905\">{{cite book |title=Electro-medical Instruments and their Management |last=Schall |first=K. |publisher=Bemrose & Sons Ltd.

To detect the hardness of the tube, the spark gap was initially opened to the widest setting. While the coil was operating, the operator reduced the gap until sparks began to appear. A tube in which the spark gap began to spark at around 2 1/2 inches was considered soft (low vacuum) and suitable for thin body parts such as hands and arms. A 5-inch spark indicated the tube was suitable for shoulders and knees. A 7-9 inch spark would indicate a higher vacuum suitable for imaging the abdomen of larger individuals. Since the spark gap was connected in parallel to the tube, the spark gap had to be opened until the sparking ceased in order to operate the tube for imaging. Exposure time for photographic plates was around half a minute for a hand to a couple of minutes for a thorax. The plates may have a small addition of fluorescent salt to reduce exposure times.<ref name=\"Scha1905\" />\n\nCrookes tubes were unreliable. They had to contain a small quantity of gas (invariably air) as a current will not flow in such a tube if they are fully evacuated. However, as time passed, the X-rays caused the glass to absorb the gas, causing the tube to generate \"harder\" X-rays until it soon stopped operating. Larger and more frequently used tubes were provided with devices for restoring the air, known as \"softeners\". These often took the form of a small side tube which contained a small piece of [[mica]], a [[mineral]] that traps relatively large quantities of air within its structure. A small electrical heater heated the mica, causing it to release a small amount of air, thus restoring the tube's efficiency. However, the mica had a limited life, and the restoration process was difficult to control.\n\nIn 1904, [[John Ambrose Fleming]] invented the [[thermionic diode]], the first kind of [[vacuum tube]]. This used a [[hot cathode]] that caused an [[electric current]] to flow in a [[vacuum]]. This idea was quickly applied to X-ray tubes, and hence heated-cathode X-ray tubes, called \"Coolidge tubes\", completely replaced the troublesome cold cathode tubes by about 1920.\n\nIn about 1906, the physicist [[Charles Barkla]] discovered that X-rays could be scattered by gases, and that each element had a characteristic [[X-ray spectrum]]. He won the 1917 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] for this discovery.\n\nIn 1912, [[Max von Laue]], Paul Knipping, and Walter Friedrich first observed the [[diffraction]] of X-rays by crystals. This discovery, along with the early work of [[Paul Peter Ewald]], [[William Henry Bragg]], and [[William Lawrence Bragg]], gave birth to the field of [[X-ray crystallography]].\n\nIn 1913, [[Henry Moseley]] performed crystallography experiments with X-rays emanating from various metals and formulated [[Moseley's law]] which relates the frequency of the X-rays to the atomic number of the metal.\n\nThe [[X-ray_tube#Coolidge_tube_(hot_cathode_tube)|Coolidge X-ray tube]] was invented the same year by [[William D. Coolidge]]. It made possible the continuous emissions of X-rays. Modern X-ray tubes are based on this design, often employing the use of rotating targets which allow for significantly higher heat dissipation than static targets, further allowing higher quantity X-ray output for use in high powered applications such as rotational CT scanners.\n\n[[File:Abell 2125.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|left|Chandra's image of the galaxy cluster Abell 2125 reveals a complex of several massive multimillion-degree-Celsius gas clouds in the process of merging.]]\n\nThe use of X-rays for medical purposes (which developed into the field of [[radiation therapy]]) was pioneered by Major [[John Hall-Edwards]] in [[Birmingham, England]].

Unlike visible light, which gives a relatively stable view of the universe, the X-ray universe is unstable.

One common alternative is to distinguish X- and gamma radiation on the basis of wavelength (or, equivalently, frequency or photon energy), with radiation shorter than some arbitrary wavelength, such as 10<sup>\u221211</sup> m (0.1 [[Angstrom|\u00c5]]), defined as gamma radiation.<ref>{{Cite book |editor= Hodgman, Charles |title= CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 44th Ed |publisher= Chemical Rubber Co. |year= 1961 |location= USA |page= 2850}}</ref>\nThis criterion assigns a photon to an unambiguous category, but is only possible if wavelength is known.

A very high [[radiation dose]] over a short period of time causes [[radiation sickness]], while lower doses can give an increased risk of [[radiation-induced cancer]].

The attenuation length is about four orders of magnitude longer for hard X-rays (right half) compared to soft X-rays (left half).]]\n\nHard X-rays can traverse relatively thick objects without being much [[absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorbed]] or [[scattering|scattered]]. For this reason, X-rays are widely used to [[imaging science|image]] the inside of visually opaque objects. The most often seen applications are in medical [[radiography]] and [[airport security]] scanners, but similar techniques are also important in industry (e.g. [[industrial radiography]] and [[industrial CT scanning]]) and research (e.g. [[small animal imaging#Micro-CT|small animal CT]]). The [[penetration depth]] varies with several [[orders of magnitude]] over the X-ray spectrum. This allows the photon energy to be adjusted for the application so as to give sufficient [[Transmittance|transmission]] through the object and at the same time provide good [[contrast (vision)|contrast]] in the image.\n\nX-rays have much shorter wavelengths than visible light, which makes it possible to probe structures much smaller than can be seen using a normal [[microscope]]. This property is used in [[X-ray microscopy]] to acquire high resolution images, and also in [[X-ray crystallography]] to determine the positions of [[atom]]s in [[crystal]]s.\n\n==Interaction with matter==\nX-rays interact with matter in three main ways, through [[photoelectric effect|photoabsorption]], [[Compton scattering]], and [[Rayleigh scattering]]. The strength of these interactions depends on the energy of the X-rays and the elemental composition of the material, but not much on chemical properties, since the X-ray photon energy is much higher than chemical binding energies. Photoabsorption or photoelectric absorption is the dominant interaction mechanism in the soft X-ray regime and for the lower hard X-ray energies. At higher energies, Compton scattering dominates.\n\n===Photoelectric absorption===\nThe probability of a photoelectric absorption per unit mass is approximately proportional to ''Z''<sup>3</sup>/''E''<sup>3</sup>, where ''Z'' is the [[atomic number]] and ''E'' is the energy of the incident photon.<ref>{{Cite book |author1=Bushberg, Jerrold T. |author2=Seibert, J.

However, the general trend of high [[absorption coefficient]]s and thus short [[penetration depth]]s for low photon energies and high atomic numbers is very strong. For soft tissue, photoabsorption dominates up to about 26&nbsp;keV photon energy where Compton scattering takes over. For higher atomic number substances this limit is higher. The high amount of [[calcium]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;20) in bones, together with their high density, is what makes them show up so clearly on medical radiographs.\n\nA photoabsorbed photon transfers all its energy to the electron with which it interacts, thus ionizing the atom to which the electron was bound and producing a photoelectron that is likely to ionize more atoms in its path. An outer electron will fill the vacant electron position and produce either a characteristic X-ray or an [[Auger electron]]. These effects can be used for elemental detection through [[X-ray spectroscopy]] or [[Auger electron spectroscopy]].\n\n===Compton scattering===\nCompton scattering is the predominant interaction between X-rays and soft tissue in medical imaging.<ref>{{Cite book |author1=Bushberg, Jerrold T. |author2=Seibert, J.

Part of the energy of the photon is transferred to the scattering electron, thereby ionizing the atom and increasing the wavelength of the X-ray. The scattered photon can go in any direction, but a direction similar to the original direction is more likely, especially for high-energy X-rays. The probability for different scattering angles are described by the [[Klein\u2013Nishina formula]].

In crystallography, a [[copper]] target is most common, with [[cobalt]] often being used when fluorescence from [[iron]] content in the sample might otherwise present a problem.\n\nThe maximum energy of the produced X-ray [[photon]] is limited by the energy of the incident electron, which is equal to the voltage on the tube times the electron charge, so an 80&nbsp;kV tube cannot create X-rays with an energy greater than 80&nbsp;keV. When the electrons hit the target, X-rays are created by two different atomic processes:\n# ''[[Characteristic X-ray]] emission'' (X-ray electroluminescence): If the electron has enough energy, it can knock an orbital electron out of the inner [[electron shell]] of the target atom. After that, electrons from higher energy levels fill the vacancies, and X-ray photons are emitted. This process produces an [[emission spectrum]] of X-rays at a few discrete frequencies, sometimes referred to as spectral lines. Usually these are transitions from the upper shells to the K shell (called K lines), to the L shell (called L lines) and so on. If the transition is from 2p to 1s, it is called K\u03b1, while if it is from 3p to 1s it is K\u03b2. The frequencies of these lines depend on the material of the target and are therefore called characteristic lines. The K\u03b1 line usually has greater intensity than the K\u03b2 one and is more desirable in diffraction experiments. Thus the K\u03b2 line is filtered out by a filter. The filter is usually made of a metal having one proton less than the anode material (e.g., Ni filter for Cu anode or Nb filter for Mo anode). \n# ''[[Bremsstrahlung]]'': This is radiation given off by the electrons as they are scattered by the strong electric field near the high-''Z'' ([[proton]] number) nuclei. These X-rays have a [[continuous spectrum]]. The frequency of bremsstrahlung is limited by the energy of incident electrons.\n\nSo, the resulting output of a tube consists of a continuous bremsstrahlung spectrum falling off to zero at the tube voltage, plus several spikes at the characteristic lines. The voltages used in diagnostic X-ray tubes range from roughly 20 kV to 150 kV and thus the highest energies of the X-ray photons range from roughly 20 keV to 150 keV.<ref>{{Cite book |last= Bushburg |first= Jerrold |author2=Seibert, Anthony |author3=Leidholdt, Edwin |author4=Boone, John |title= The Essential Physics of Medical Imaging |publisher= Lippincott Williams & Wilkins |year= 2002 |location= USA |page= 116 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=VZvqqaQ5DvoC&pg=PT33&dq=radiography+kerma+rem+Sievert |isbn= 978-0-683-30118-2}}</ref>\n\nBoth of these X-ray production processes are inefficient, with only about one percent of the electrical energy used by the tube converted into X-rays, and thus most of the [[electric power]] consumed by the tube is released as waste heat. When producing a usable flux of X-rays, the X-ray tube must be designed to dissipate the excess heat.\n\nA specialized source of X-rays which is becoming widely used in research is [[synchrotron radiation]], which is generated by [[particle accelerator]]s.

Bones contain much [[calcium]], which due to its relatively high [[atomic number]] absorbs x-rays efficiently. This reduces the amount of X-rays reaching the detector in the shadow of the bones, making them clearly visible on the radiograph. The lungs and trapped gas also show up clearly because of lower absorption compared to tissue, while differences between tissue types are harder to see.\n\nProjectional radiographs are useful in the detection of [[pathology]] of the [[bone|skeletal system]] as well as for detecting some disease processes in [[soft tissue]]. Some notable examples are the very common [[chest radiograph|chest X-ray]], which can be used to identify lung diseases such as [[pneumonia]], [[lung cancer]], or [[pulmonary edema]], and the [[abdominal x-ray]], which can detect [[bowel obstruction|bowel (or intestinal) obstruction]], free air (from visceral perforations) and free fluid (in [[ascites]]). X-rays may also be used to detect pathology such as [[gallstone]]s (which are rarely [[radiodensity|radiopaque]]) or [[kidney stone]]s which are often (but not always) visible. Traditional plain X-rays are less useful in the imaging of soft tissues such as the [[human brain|brain]] or [[muscle]]. One area where projectional radiographs are used extensively is in evaluating how an orthopedic [[Implant (medicine)|implant]], such as a knee, hip or shoulder replacement, is situated in the body with respect to the surrounding bone. This can be assessed in two dimensions from plain radiographs, or it can be assessed in three dimensions if a technique called '2D to 3D registration' is used. This technique purportedly negates projection errors associated with evaluating implant position from plain radiographs.<ref>Accuracy of total knee implant position assessment based on postoperative X-rays, registered to pre-operative CT-based 3D models.

Hence, a thin metal sheet, often of [[aluminium]], called an [[X-ray filter]], is usually placed over the window of the X-ray tube, absorbing the low energy part in the spectrum. This is called ''hardening'' the beam since it shifts the center of the spectrum towards higher energy (or harder) x-rays.\n\nTo generate an image of the [[cardiovascular system#Human cardiovascular system|cardiovascular system]], including the arteries and veins ([[angiography]]) an initial image is taken of the anatomical region of interest. A second image is then taken of the same region after an iodinated [[radiocontrast agent|contrast agent]] has been injected into the blood vessels within this area. These two images are then digitally subtracted, leaving an image of only the iodinated contrast outlining the blood vessels. The [[radiology|radiologist]] or [[surgeon]] then compares the image obtained to normal anatomical images to determine whether there is any damage or blockage of the vessel.\n\n===Computed tomography===\n[[File:Brain CT scan.jpg|thumb|Head [[X-ray computed tomography|CT scan]] ([[transverse plane]]) slice -\u2013 a modern application of [[medical radiography]]]]\n[[Computed tomography]] (CT scanning) is a medical imaging modality where [[tomography|tomographic images]] or slices of specific areas of the body are obtained from a large series of two-dimensional X-ray images taken in different directions.<ref name=\"ref1\">{{Cite book |last= Herman |first= Gabor T. |authorlink=Gabor Herman |title= Fundamentals of Computerized Tomography: Image Reconstruction from Projections |year= 2009 |publisher= Springer |edition=2nd |isbn=978-1-85233-617-2 }}</ref> These cross-sectional images can be combined into a [[three-dimensional space|three-dimensional]] image of the inside of the body and used for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes in various medical disciplines.\n\n===Fluoroscopy===\n[[Fluoroscopy]] is an imaging technique commonly used by [[physicians]] or [[radiation therapist]]s to obtain real-time moving images of the internal structures of a patient through the use of a fluoroscope. In its simplest form, a fluoroscope consists of an X-ray source and a fluorescent screen, between which a patient is placed. However, modern fluoroscopes couple the screen to an [[X-ray image intensifier]] and [[charge-coupled device|CCD]] [[video camera]] allowing the images to be recorded and played on a monitor.

In 1987, they accounted for 58% of exposure from man-made sources in the [[United States]]. Since man-made sources accounted for only 18% of the total radiation exposure, most of which came from natural sources (82%), medical X-rays only accounted for 10% of ''total'' American radiation exposure; medical procedures as a whole (including [[nuclear medicine]]) accounted for 14% of total radiation exposure. By 2006, however, medical procedures in the United States were contributing much more ionizing radiation than was the case in the early 1980s. In 2006, medical exposure constituted nearly half of the total radiation exposure of the U.S. population from all sources. The increase is traceable to the growth in the use of medical imaging procedures, in particular [[computed tomography]] (CT), and to the growth in the use of nuclear medicine.<ref name=Science09>[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/03/090303125809.htm Medical Radiation Exposure Of The U.S. Population Greatly Increased Since The Early 1980s], Science Daily, March 5, 2009</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last= US National Research Council |title= Health Risks from Low Levels of Ionizing Radiation, BEIR 7 phase 2 |publisher= National Academies Press |year= 2006 |pages= 5, fig.PS\u20132 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=Uqj4OzBKlHwC&pg=PA5 |isbn= 978-0-309-09156-5}}, data credited to NCRP (US National Committee on Radiation Protection) 1987</ref>\n\nDosage due to dental X-rays varies significantly depending on the procedure and the technology (film or digital).

Brandes, in an experiment a short time after [[Wilhelm R\u00f6ntgen|R\u00f6ntgen's]] landmark 1895 paper, reported after dark adaptation and placing his eye close to an X-ray tube, seeing a faint \"blue-gray\" glow which seemed to originate within the eye itself.<ref>{{Cite web |last= Frame |first= Paul |title= Wilhelm R\u00f6ntgen and the Invisible Light |website= Tales from the Atomic Age |publisher= Oak Ridge Associated Universities |url= http://www.orau.org/ptp/articlesstories/invisiblelight.htm |accessdate= 2008-05-19}}</ref> Upon hearing this, R\u00f6ntgen reviewed his record books and found he too had seen the effect. When placing an X-ray tube on the opposite side of a wooden door R\u00f6ntgen had noted the same blue glow, seeming to emanate from the eye itself, but thought his observations to be spurious because he only saw the effect when he used one type of tube. Later he realized that the tube which had created the effect was the only one powerful enough to make the glow plainly visible and the [[experiment]] was thereafter readily repeatable. The knowledge that X-rays are actually faintly visible to the dark-adapted naked eye has largely been forgotten today; this is probably due to the desire not to repeat what would now be seen as a recklessly dangerous and potentially harmful experiment with [[ionizing radiation]]. It is not known what exact mechanism in the eye produces the visibility: it could be due to conventional detection (excitation of [[rhodopsin]] molecules in the retina), direct excitation of retinal nerve cells, or secondary detection via, for instance, X-ray induction of [[phosphorescence]] in the eyeball with conventional retinal detection of the secondarily produced visible light.\n\nThough X-rays are otherwise invisible, it is possible to see the [[ionization]] of the air molecules if the intensity of the X-ray beam is high enough.

This measure of energy absorbed is called the [[absorbed dose]]:\n* The [[gray (unit)|gray]] (Gy), which has units of (joules/kilogram), is the SI unit of [[absorbed dose]], and it is the amount of radiation required to deposit one [[joule]] of energy in one [[kilogram]] of any kind of matter.\n* The [[rad (unit)|rad]] is the (obsolete) corresponding traditional unit, equal to 10 millijoules of energy deposited per kilogram. 100 rad= 1 gray.\n\nThe [[equivalent dose]] is the measure of the biological effect of radiation on human tissue. For X-rays it is equal to the [[absorbed dose]].\n* The [[Roentgen equivalent man]] (rem) is the traditional unit of equivalent dose.

They were noticed by scientists investigating [[cathode ray]]s produced by such tubes, which are energetic [[electron]] beams that were first observed in 1869. Many of the early [[Crookes tube]]s (invented around 1875) undoubtedly radiated X-rays, because early researchers noticed effects that were attributable to them, as detailed below. Crookes tubes created free electrons by [[ionization]] of the residual air in the tube by a high DC [[voltage]] of anywhere between a few [[kilovolt]]s and 100 kV. This voltage accelerated the electrons coming from the [[cathode]] to a high enough velocity that they created X-rays when they struck the [[anode]] or the glass wall of the tube.<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/npre.2009.3267.5|title=The History, Development and Impact of Computed Imaging in Neurological Diagnosis and Neurosurgery: CT, MRI, and DTI|journal=Nature Precedings|year=2009|last1=Filler|first1=Aaron}}.</ref>\n\nThe earliest experimenter thought to have (unknowingly) produced X-rays was actuary [[William Morgan (actuary)|William Morgan]].

This image was used to argue that [[ionizing radiation|radiation exposure]] during the X-ray procedure would be negligible.]]\n\nThe many applications of X-rays immediately generated enormous interest. Workshops began making specialized versions of Crookes tubes for generating X-rays and these first-generation [[cold cathode]] or Crookes X-ray tubes were used until about 1920.\n\nA typical early 20th century medical x-ray system consisted of a [[Induction coil|Ruhmkorff coil]] connected to a [[X-ray_tube#Crookes_tube_(cold_cathode_tube)|cold cathode Crookes X-ray tube]]. A spark gap was typically connected to the high voltage side in parallel to the tube and used for diagnostic purposes.<ref name=\"Scha1905\">{{cite book |title=Electro-medical Instruments and their Management |last=Schall |first=K. |publisher=Bemrose & Sons Ltd.

To detect the hardness of the tube, the spark gap was initially opened to the widest setting. While the coil was operating, the operator reduced the gap until sparks began to appear. A tube in which the spark gap began to spark at around 2 1/2 inches was considered soft (low vacuum) and suitable for thin body parts such as hands and arms. A 5-inch spark indicated the tube was suitable for shoulders and knees. A 7-9 inch spark would indicate a higher vacuum suitable for imaging the abdomen of larger individuals. Since the spark gap was connected in parallel to the tube, the spark gap had to be opened until the sparking ceased in order to operate the tube for imaging. Exposure time for photographic plates was around half a minute for a hand to a couple of minutes for a thorax. The plates may have a small addition of fluorescent salt to reduce exposure times.<ref name=\"Scha1905\" />\n\nCrookes tubes were unreliable. They had to contain a small quantity of gas (invariably air) as a current will not flow in such a tube if they are fully evacuated. However, as time passed, the X-rays caused the glass to absorb the gas, causing the tube to generate \"harder\" X-rays until it soon stopped operating. Larger and more frequently used tubes were provided with devices for restoring the air, known as \"softeners\". These often took the form of a small side tube which contained a small piece of [[mica]], a [[mineral]] that traps relatively large quantities of air within its structure. A small electrical heater heated the mica, causing it to release a small amount of air, thus restoring the tube's efficiency. However, the mica had a limited life, and the restoration process was difficult to control.\n\nIn 1904, [[John Ambrose Fleming]] invented the [[thermionic diode]], the first kind of [[vacuum tube]]. This used a [[hot cathode]] that caused an [[electric current]] to flow in a [[vacuum]]. This idea was quickly applied to X-ray tubes, and hence heated-cathode X-ray tubes, called \"Coolidge tubes\", completely replaced the troublesome cold cathode tubes by about 1920.\n\nIn about 1906, the physicist [[Charles Barkla]] discovered that X-rays could be scattered by gases, and that each element had a characteristic [[X-ray spectrum]]. He won the 1917 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] for this discovery.\n\nIn 1912, [[Max von Laue]], Paul Knipping, and Walter Friedrich first observed the [[diffraction]] of X-rays by crystals. This discovery, along with the early work of [[Paul Peter Ewald]], [[William Henry Bragg]], and [[William Lawrence Bragg]], gave birth to the field of [[X-ray crystallography]].\n\nIn 1913, [[Henry Moseley]] performed crystallography experiments with X-rays emanating from various metals and formulated [[Moseley's law]] which relates the frequency of the X-rays to the atomic number of the metal.\n\nThe [[X-ray_tube#Coolidge_tube_(hot_cathode_tube)|Coolidge X-ray tube]] was invented the same year by [[William D. Coolidge]]. It made possible the continuous emissions of X-rays. Modern X-ray tubes are based on this design, often employing the use of rotating targets which allow for significantly higher heat dissipation than static targets, further allowing higher quantity X-ray output for use in high powered applications such as rotational CT scanners.\n\n[[File:Abell 2125.jpg|thumb|upright=0.8|left|Chandra's image of the galaxy cluster Abell 2125 reveals a complex of several massive multimillion-degree-Celsius gas clouds in the process of merging.]]\n\nThe use of X-rays for medical purposes (which developed into the field of [[radiation therapy]]) was pioneered by Major [[John Hall-Edwards]] in [[Birmingham, England]].

Unlike visible light, which gives a relatively stable view of the universe, the X-ray universe is unstable.

One common alternative is to distinguish X- and gamma radiation on the basis of wavelength (or, equivalently, frequency or photon energy), with radiation shorter than some arbitrary wavelength, such as 10<sup>\u221211</sup> m (0.1 [[Angstrom|\u00c5]]), defined as gamma radiation.<ref>{{Cite book |editor= Hodgman, Charles |title= CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 44th Ed |publisher= Chemical Rubber Co. |year= 1961 |location= USA |page= 2850}}</ref>\nThis criterion assigns a photon to an unambiguous category, but is only possible if wavelength is known.

A very high [[radiation dose]] over a short period of time causes [[radiation sickness]], while lower doses can give an increased risk of [[radiation-induced cancer]].

The attenuation length is about four orders of magnitude longer for hard X-rays (right half) compared to soft X-rays (left half).]]\n\nHard X-rays can traverse relatively thick objects without being much [[absorption (electromagnetic radiation)|absorbed]] or [[scattering|scattered]]. For this reason, X-rays are widely used to [[imaging science|image]] the inside of visually opaque objects. The most often seen applications are in medical [[radiography]] and [[airport security]] scanners, but similar techniques are also important in industry (e.g. [[industrial radiography]] and [[industrial CT scanning]]) and research (e.g. [[small animal imaging#Micro-CT|small animal CT]]). The [[penetration depth]] varies with several [[orders of magnitude]] over the X-ray spectrum. This allows the photon energy to be adjusted for the application so as to give sufficient [[Transmittance|transmission]] through the object and at the same time provide good [[contrast (vision)|contrast]] in the image.\n\nX-rays have much shorter wavelengths than visible light, which makes it possible to probe structures much smaller than can be seen using a normal [[microscope]]. This property is used in [[X-ray microscopy]] to acquire high resolution images, and also in [[X-ray crystallography]] to determine the positions of [[atom]]s in [[crystal]]s.\n\n==Interaction with matter==\nX-rays interact with matter in three main ways, through [[photoelectric effect|photoabsorption]], [[Compton scattering]], and [[Rayleigh scattering]]. The strength of these interactions depends on the energy of the X-rays and the elemental composition of the material, but not much on chemical properties, since the X-ray photon energy is much higher than chemical binding energies. Photoabsorption or photoelectric absorption is the dominant interaction mechanism in the soft X-ray regime and for the lower hard X-ray energies. At higher energies, Compton scattering dominates.\n\n===Photoelectric absorption===\nThe probability of a photoelectric absorption per unit mass is approximately proportional to ''Z''<sup>3</sup>/''E''<sup>3</sup>, where ''Z'' is the [[atomic number]] and ''E'' is the energy of the incident photon.<ref>{{Cite book |author1=Bushberg, Jerrold T. |author2=Seibert, J.

However, the general trend of high [[absorption coefficient]]s and thus short [[penetration depth]]s for low photon energies and high atomic numbers is very strong. For soft tissue, photoabsorption dominates up to about 26&nbsp;keV photon energy where Compton scattering takes over. For higher atomic number substances this limit is higher. The high amount of [[calcium]] (''Z''&nbsp;=&nbsp;20) in bones, together with their high density, is what makes them show up so clearly on medical radiographs.\n\nA photoabsorbed photon transfers all its energy to the electron with which it interacts, thus ionizing the atom to which the electron was bound and producing a photoelectron that is likely to ionize more atoms in its path. An outer electron will fill the vacant electron position and produce either a characteristic X-ray or an [[Auger electron]]. These effects can be used for elemental detection through [[X-ray spectroscopy]] or [[Auger electron spectroscopy]].\n\n===Compton scattering===\nCompton scattering is the predominant interaction between X-rays and soft tissue in medical imaging.<ref>{{Cite book |author1=Bushberg, Jerrold T. |author2=Seibert, J.

Part of the energy of the photon is transferred to the scattering electron, thereby ionizing the atom and increasing the wavelength of the X-ray. The scattered photon can go in any direction, but a direction similar to the original direction is more likely, especially for high-energy X-rays. The probability for different scattering angles are described by the [[Klein\u2013Nishina formula]].

In crystallography, a [[copper]] target is most common, with [[cobalt]] often being used when fluorescence from [[iron]] content in the sample might otherwise present a problem.\n\nThe maximum energy of the produced X-ray [[photon]] is limited by the energy of the incident electron, which is equal to the voltage on the tube times the electron charge, so an 80&nbsp;kV tube cannot create X-rays with an energy greater than 80&nbsp;keV. When the electrons hit the target, X-rays are created by two different atomic processes:\n# ''[[Characteristic X-ray]] emission'' (X-ray electroluminescence): If the electron has enough energy, it can knock an orbital electron out of the inner [[electron shell]] of the target atom. After that, electrons from higher energy levels fill the vacancies, and X-ray photons are emitted. This process produces an [[emission spectrum]] of X-rays at a few discrete frequencies, sometimes referred to as spectral lines. Usually these are transitions from the upper shells to the K shell (called K lines), to the L shell (called L lines) and so on. If the transition is from 2p to 1s, it is called K\u03b1, while if it is from 3p to 1s it is K\u03b2. The frequencies of these lines depend on the material of the target and are therefore called characteristic lines. The K\u03b1 line usually has greater intensity than the K\u03b2 one and is more desirable in diffraction experiments. Thus the K\u03b2 line is filtered out by a filter. The filter is usually made of a metal having one proton less than the anode material (e.g., Ni filter for Cu anode or Nb filter for Mo anode). \n# ''[[Bremsstrahlung]]'': This is radiation given off by the electrons as they are scattered by the strong electric field near the high-''Z'' ([[proton]] number) nuclei. These X-rays have a [[continuous spectrum]]. The frequency of bremsstrahlung is limited by the energy of incident electrons.\n\nSo, the resulting output of a tube consists of a continuous bremsstrahlung spectrum falling off to zero at the tube voltage, plus several spikes at the characteristic lines. The voltages used in diagnostic X-ray tubes range from roughly 20 kV to 150 kV and thus the highest energies of the X-ray photons range from roughly 20 keV to 150 keV.<ref>{{Cite book |last= Bushburg |first= Jerrold |author2=Seibert, Anthony |author3=Leidholdt, Edwin |author4=Boone, John |title= The Essential Physics of Medical Imaging |publisher= Lippincott Williams & Wilkins |year= 2002 |location= USA |page= 116 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=VZvqqaQ5DvoC&pg=PT33&dq=radiography+kerma+rem+Sievert |isbn= 978-0-683-30118-2}}</ref>\n\nBoth of these X-ray production processes are inefficient, with only about one percent of the electrical energy used by the tube converted into X-rays, and thus most of the [[electric power]] consumed by the tube is released as waste heat. When producing a usable flux of X-rays, the X-ray tube must be designed to dissipate the excess heat.\n\nA specialized source of X-rays which is becoming widely used in research is [[synchrotron radiation]], which is generated by [[particle accelerator]]s.

Bones contain much [[calcium]], which due to its relatively high [[atomic number]] absorbs x-rays efficiently. This reduces the amount of X-rays reaching the detector in the shadow of the bones, making them clearly visible on the radiograph. The lungs and trapped gas also show up clearly because of lower absorption compared to tissue, while differences between tissue types are harder to see.\n\nProjectional radiographs are useful in the detection of [[pathology]] of the [[bone|skeletal system]] as well as for detecting some disease processes in [[soft tissue]]. Some notable examples are the very common [[chest radiograph|chest X-ray]], which can be used to identify lung diseases such as [[pneumonia]], [[lung cancer]], or [[pulmonary edema]], and the [[abdominal x-ray]], which can detect [[bowel obstruction|bowel (or intestinal) obstruction]], free air (from visceral perforations) and free fluid (in [[ascites]]). X-rays may also be used to detect pathology such as [[gallstone]]s (which are rarely [[radiodensity|radiopaque]]) or [[kidney stone]]s which are often (but not always) visible. Traditional plain X-rays are less useful in the imaging of soft tissues such as the [[human brain|brain]] or [[muscle]]. One area where projectional radiographs are used extensively is in evaluating how an orthopedic [[Implant (medicine)|implant]], such as a knee, hip or shoulder replacement, is situated in the body with respect to the surrounding bone. This can be assessed in two dimensions from plain radiographs, or it can be assessed in three dimensions if a technique called '2D to 3D registration' is used. This technique purportedly negates projection errors associated with evaluating implant position from plain radiographs.<ref>Accuracy of total knee implant position assessment based on postoperative X-rays, registered to pre-operative CT-based 3D models.

Hence, a thin metal sheet, often of [[aluminium]], called an [[X-ray filter]], is usually placed over the window of the X-ray tube, absorbing the low energy part in the spectrum. This is called ''hardening'' the beam since it shifts the center of the spectrum towards higher energy (or harder) x-rays.\n\nTo generate an image of the [[cardiovascular system#Human cardiovascular system|cardiovascular system]], including the arteries and veins ([[angiography]]) an initial image is taken of the anatomical region of interest. A second image is then taken of the same region after an iodinated [[radiocontrast agent|contrast agent]] has been injected into the blood vessels within this area. These two images are then digitally subtracted, leaving an image of only the iodinated contrast outlining the blood vessels. The [[radiology|radiologist]] or [[surgeon]] then compares the image obtained to normal anatomical images to determine whether there is any damage or blockage of the vessel.\n\n===Computed tomography===\n[[File:Brain CT scan.jpg|thumb|Head [[X-ray computed tomography|CT scan]] ([[transverse plane]]) slice -\u2013 a modern application of [[medical radiography]]]]\n[[Computed tomography]] (CT scanning) is a medical imaging modality where [[tomography|tomographic images]] or slices of specific areas of the body are obtained from a large series of two-dimensional X-ray images taken in different directions.<ref name=\"ref1\">{{Cite book |last= Herman |first= Gabor T. |authorlink=Gabor Herman |title= Fundamentals of Computerized Tomography: Image Reconstruction from Projections |year= 2009 |publisher= Springer |edition=2nd |isbn=978-1-85233-617-2 }}</ref> These cross-sectional images can be combined into a [[three-dimensional space|three-dimensional]] image of the inside of the body and used for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes in various medical disciplines.\n\n===Fluoroscopy===\n[[Fluoroscopy]] is an imaging technique commonly used by [[physicians]] or [[radiation therapist]]s to obtain real-time moving images of the internal structures of a patient through the use of a fluoroscope. In its simplest form, a fluoroscope consists of an X-ray source and a fluorescent screen, between which a patient is placed. However, modern fluoroscopes couple the screen to an [[X-ray image intensifier]] and [[charge-coupled device|CCD]] [[video camera]] allowing the images to be recorded and played on a monitor.

In 1987, they accounted for 58% of exposure from man-made sources in the [[United States]]. Since man-made sources accounted for only 18% of the total radiation exposure, most of which came from natural sources (82%), medical X-rays only accounted for 10% of ''total'' American radiation exposure; medical procedures as a whole (including [[nuclear medicine]]) accounted for 14% of total radiation exposure. By 2006, however, medical procedures in the United States were contributing much more ionizing radiation than was the case in the early 1980s. In 2006, medical exposure constituted nearly half of the total radiation exposure of the U.S. population from all sources. The increase is traceable to the growth in the use of medical imaging procedures, in particular [[computed tomography]] (CT), and to the growth in the use of nuclear medicine.<ref name=Science09>[https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/03/090303125809.htm Medical Radiation Exposure Of The U.S. Population Greatly Increased Since The Early 1980s], Science Daily, March 5, 2009</ref><ref>{{Cite book |last= US National Research Council |title= Health Risks from Low Levels of Ionizing Radiation, BEIR 7 phase 2 |publisher= National Academies Press |year= 2006 |pages= 5, fig.PS\u20132 |url= https://books.google.com/?id=Uqj4OzBKlHwC&pg=PA5 |isbn= 978-0-309-09156-5}}, data credited to NCRP (US National Committee on Radiation Protection) 1987</ref>\n\nDosage due to dental X-rays varies significantly depending on the procedure and the technology (film or digital).

Brandes, in an experiment a short time after [[Wilhelm R\u00f6ntgen|R\u00f6ntgen's]] landmark 1895 paper, reported after dark adaptation and placing his eye close to an X-ray tube, seeing a faint \"blue-gray\" glow which seemed to originate within the eye itself.<ref>{{Cite web |last= Frame |first= Paul |title= Wilhelm R\u00f6ntgen and the Invisible Light |website= Tales from the Atomic Age |publisher= Oak Ridge Associated Universities |url= http://www.orau.org/ptp/articlesstories/invisiblelight.htm |accessdate= 2008-05-19}}</ref> Upon hearing this, R\u00f6ntgen reviewed his record books and found he too had seen the effect. When placing an X-ray tube on the opposite side of a wooden door R\u00f6ntgen had noted the same blue glow, seeming to emanate from the eye itself, but thought his observations to be spurious because he only saw the effect when he used one type of tube. Later he realized that the tube which had created the effect was the only one powerful enough to make the glow plainly visible and the [[experiment]] was thereafter readily repeatable. The knowledge that X-rays are actually faintly visible to the dark-adapted naked eye has largely been forgotten today; this is probably due to the desire not to repeat what would now be seen as a recklessly dangerous and potentially harmful experiment with [[ionizing radiation]]. It is not known what exact mechanism in the eye produces the visibility: it could be due to conventional detection (excitation of [[rhodopsin]] molecules in the retina), direct excitation of retinal nerve cells, or secondary detection via, for instance, X-ray induction of [[phosphorescence]] in the eyeball with conventional retinal detection of the secondarily produced visible light.\n\nThough X-rays are otherwise invisible, it is possible to see the [[ionization]] of the air molecules if the intensity of the X-ray beam is high enough.

This measure of energy absorbed is called the [[absorbed dose]]:\n* The [[gray (unit)|gray]] (Gy), which has units of (joules/kilogram), is the SI unit of [[absorbed dose]], and it is the amount of radiation required to deposit one [[joule]] of energy in one [[kilogram]] of any kind of matter.\n* The [[rad (unit)|rad]] is the (obsolete) corresponding traditional unit, equal to 10 millijoules of energy deposited per kilogram. 100 rad= 1 gray.\n\nThe [[equivalent dose]] is the measure of the biological effect of radiation on human tissue. For X-rays it is equal to the [[absorbed dose]].\n* The [[Roentgen equivalent man]] (rem) is the traditional unit of equivalent dose. For X-rays it is equal to the [[Rad (unit)|rad]], or, in other words, 10 millijoules of energy deposited per kilogram. 100 rem = 1 Sv.\n* The [[sievert]] (Sv) is the SI unit of [[equivalent dose]], and also of [[effective dose (radiation)|effective dose]]. For X-rays the \"equivalent dose\" is numerically equal to a [[Gray (unit)|Gray]] (Gy). 1 Sv= 1 Gy. For the \"effective dose\" of X-rays, it is usually not equal to the Gray (Gy).\n{{Radiation related quantities}}\n\n==See also==\n{{Portal|Medical|Physics}}\n{{div col}}\n* [[Backscatter X-ray]]\n* [[Detective quantum efficiency]]\n* [[High-energy X-rays]]\n* [[Macintyre's X-Ray Film]] \u2013 1896 documentary radiography film\n* [[N ray]]\n* [[Neutron radiation]]\n* [[NuSTAR]]\n* [[Radiographer]]\n* [[Reflection (physics)]]\n* [[Resonant inelastic X-ray scattering]] (RIXS)\n* [[Small-angle X-ray scattering]] (SAXS)\n* [[The X-Rays]] \u2013 1897 British short silent comedy film\n* [[X-ray absorption spectroscopy]]\n* [[X-ray marker]]\n* [[X-ray nanoprobe]]\n* [[X-ray reflectivity]]\n* [[X-ray vision]]\n* [[X-ray welding]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons}}\n{{Wiktionary}}\n* [http://www.crtsite.com/page5.html Historical X-ray tubes ]\n* R\u00f6ntgen's 1895 article, on line and analyzed on ''[https://www.bibnum.education.fr/physique/electricite-electromagnetisme/la-decouverte-des-rayons-x-par-roentgen BibNum]'' <small>[click '\u00e0 t\u00e9l\u00e9charger' for English analysis]</small>\n* [http://www.rtstudents.com/x-rays/broken-humerus-xray.htm Example Radiograph: Fractured Humerus]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070810063814/http://www.iuk.edu/~koalhe/img/Equipment/xray.jpg A Photograph of an X-ray Machine]\n* [http://www.x-raysafety.com/ X-ray Safety]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20161014114921/http://www.ionactive.co.uk/multi-media_video.html?m=4 An X-ray tube demonstration (Animation)]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20070710033139/http://deutsche.nature.com/physics/7.pdf 1896 Article: \"On a New Kind of Rays\"]\n* [https://docs.google.com/fileview?id=0B89CZuXbiY7mNmQxYmVlNDktNjBiZS00NjcwLTg0ODgtZjc3NWUwOWUxZDg5&hl=tr \"Digital X-Ray Technologies Project\"]\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20100729022133/http://rad.usuhs.mil/rad/home/whatis.html What is Radiology?] a simple tutorial\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20100306044636/http://rad.usuhs.edu/medpix/ 50,000 X-ray, MRI, and CT pictures] MedPix medical image database\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20161130192314/http://www.datasync.com/~rsf1/bremindx.htm Index of Early Bremsstrahlung Articles]\n* [http://www.life.com/image/first/in-gallery/44881/extraordinary-x-rays Extraordinary X-Rays] \u2013 slideshow by ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]''\n* [http://www.xtal.iqfr.csic.es/Cristalografia/index-en.html X-rays and crystals]\n{{EMSpectrum}}\n{{Nuclear Technology}}\n{{Radiation}}\n\n{{Authority control}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:X-Ray}}\n[[Category:X-rays| ]]\n[[Category:Electromagnetic spectrum]]\n[[Category:IARC Group 1 carcinogens]]\n[[Category:Ionizing radiation]]\n[[Category:Medical physics]]\n[[Category:Radiography]]\n[[Category:Wilhelm R\u00f6ntgen]]\n[[Category:1895 in science]]\n[[Category:1895 in Germany]]\n", "name_user": "Juanito212", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X-ray"}
