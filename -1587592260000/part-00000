De Ferran was the 2000 and 2001 [[Champ Car]] champion driving for [[Team Penske]] and the winner of the [[2003 Indianapolis 500]]. He also finished runner-up in the [[American Le Mans Series]] LMP1 class with his own [[de Ferran Motorsports]].\n\n==Early career==\n\nInspired by the success of fellow Brazilian [[Emerson Fittipaldi]], de Ferran began his career in [[kart racing]] in the early 1980s. He graduated to Formula Ford level in 1987 and [[Formula Three]] in 1991. Driving for [[Edenbridge Racing]], De Ferran finished the [[1991 British Formula Three season]] in third, only behind [[Rubens Barrichello]] and [[David Coulthard]].  For the [[1992 British Formula Three season|1992]] season, De Ferran moved to [[Paul Stewart Racing]] and won the title, scoring seven wins in the process.\n\n1993 and 1994 were spent driving for Paul Stewart Racing in [[International Formula 3000]]. De Ferran finished fourth in the series in 1993 and then took the championship down to the wire in 1994, ultimately finishing third.  In 1993, De Ferran tested for a day the [[Footwork Arrows]] [[Formula One]] team along with Dutch racer [[Jos Verstappen]].  His day was seriously compromised after he bumped his head while walking nearby the motorhome.  His times also compared poorly to Verstappen's.\n\n==CART==\n\nAt the end of 1994, de Ferran was invited to test a [[Champ Car|CAR]]T by [[Jim Hall (racing driver)|Hall/VDS Racing]]. Despite the worries of the team's sponsor [[Pennzoil]] that de Ferran was not famous enough name for their car, the team was sufficiently impressed to offer de Ferran a drive for 1995. With no top-line [[Formula One]] drive available de Ferran took up the offer to drive in America.\n\nDe Ferran won the rookie of the year award in 1995 by finishing 14th. He scored his first [[Champ Car|CAR]]T win in the last race of the year at [[Laguna Seca Raceway]].\n\nIn 1996, de Ferran was a consistent challenger but only scored one win, at Cleveland. This win was the last for veteran car owner and driver [[Jim Hall (racing driver)|Jim Hall]] who retired from the sport at the end of 1996. Hall's retirement also spelled the end of the Pennzoil Hall team. Despite rumours that he would be a driver for the new [[Stewart Grand Prix]] Formula One team, de Ferran stayed in America for 1997, joining [[Walker Racing]].\n\nDe Ferran finished 1997 as runner-up to [[Alex Zanardi]] with ten top-ten finishes but failed to score a single victory. He looked on course to win the season opener at [[Homestead-Miami Speedway|Homestead]] but was knocked out of the lead by a lapped driver, [[Dennis Vitolo]]. At the [[Grand Prix of Portland]] he lost out to [[PacWest Racing]]'s [[Mark Blundell]] in the closest finish in CART history.\n\nThe expected championship challenge never materialized in 1998. Unreliability, driver errors and the inferior performance of the [[Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company|Goodyear]] tires compared to the [[Firestone Tire and Rubber Company|Firestone]] tires all combined to leave de Ferran 12th in the standings, again with no wins in the year.\n\nIn 1999 the breakthrough finally came as de Ferran beat [[Juan Pablo Montoya]] at Portland to take his first win since mid-1996 and the Walker team's first since early-1995. However that victory would be the end of an era as Goodyear and [[Valvoline]] both left CART racing at the end of 1999. Toward the end of that season, de Ferran and [[Greg Moore (racing driver)|Greg Moore]] were signed to [[Penske Racing|Marlboro Team Penske]] to replace [[Al Unser, Jr.]] and the rotating arrangement of drivers employed after [[Andr\u00e9 Ribeiro (racing driver)|Andre Ribeiro]] retired. However, Moore was killed in a crash in the season finale and de Ferran's fellow countryman [[H\u00e9lio Castroneves]] joined him.\n\nOn October 28, 2000, during CART qualifying at [[California Speedway]], de Ferran set the track record for fastest lap at {{convert|241.428|mi/h|km/h|3|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite news|title=De Ferran wins pole, sets record|url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2000/oct/28/de-ferran-wins-pole-sets-record|newspaper=[[Las Vegas Sun]]|date=October 28, 2000|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110003755/http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2000/oct/28/de-ferran-wins-pole-sets-record|archivedate=November 10, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> As of August 2018, this stands as the fastest qualifying lap speed ever recorded at an official race meeting.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prnmag.com/opinions-commentary/553-who-holds-the-worlds-closed-course-record-aj-foyt|title=Who holds the world's closed course record?

His analytical approach earned him comparisons with Penske's first driver, [[Mark Donohue]]. He also garnered praise for his politeness and integrity: when Penske switched to the [[Indy Racing League]] in 2002, he did not criticize the move even though it meant he could not defend his Champ Car title.\n\nIn 2003, de Ferran was injured during a race at [[Phoenix Raceway|Phoenix]], suffering a broken back. Despite the injury, de Ferran passed his teammate, Castroneves with 31 laps left to win an emotional victory at the [[2003 Indianapolis 500]]. It also was the second 1-2 finish for Penske Racing in the Indianapolis 500.\n\nFollowing his Indianapolis triumph de Ferran decided to retire at the end of 2003. He won his final race, although the moment was soured by a terrifying crash during the race that left fellow Indy winner [[Kenny Br\u00e4ck]] seriously injured.\n\n==Formula One managerial career==\n\nIn 2005, he moved to the [[British American Racing|BAR-Honda]] Formula One team as their Sports Director. He resigned from this position in July 2007 after becoming \"increasingly uncomfortable\" with the team.<ref name=\"autosport_16july07\">{{cite news |title=De Ferran quits role with Honda |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/motorsport/formula_one/6901609.stm |publisher=BBC Sport |date=July 16, 2007 |accessdate=July 16, 2007}}</ref>\n\nIn July 2018 de Ferran was made sporting director for McLaren following Eric Boullier's resignation.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.autosport.com/f1/news/137192/boullier-resigns-from-mclaren-racing-chief-role |title=Eric Boullier resigns from McLaren Formula 1 team |date=July 4, 2018 |first=Scott |last=Mitchell |website=www.autosport.com |access-date=March 30, 2020}}</ref>\n\n==de Ferran Motorsports==\n\nOn January 29, 2008 de Ferran announced that he would return to the cockpit and field a factory-backed LMP2 class [[Acura ARX-01b]] prototype in the [[American Le Mans Series]], under the team name [[de Ferran Motorsports]]. The team began competing around the mid-way point of the 2008 season, with De Ferran running the team and sharing driving duties with [[Simon Pagenaud]].<ref>Olson, Jeff. [http://www.speedtv.com/articles/auto/alms/42793/ De Ferran to Become Acura Owner/Driver] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080201075555/http://www.speedtv.com/articles/auto/alms/42793/ |date=2008-02-01 }}, SpeedTV.com, January 29, 2008</ref>\n\nSuccess again was immediate and de Ferran Motorsports took four front row grid positions, led six races and scored three podium finishes in just eight starts.\n\n2009 saw another challenge when de Ferran Motorsports was chosen by Honda to develop the Acura ARX-02a for competition in the LMP1 division of the American Le Mans Series.  The team scored five outright wins, seven poles, seven fastest laps and finished runners up in the ALMS LMP1 class.\n\n==Return to IndyCar==\n\nHalf way through 2009 de Ferran announced his decision to retire from the cockpit at the end of the racing season, expressing his intention to concentrate all his resources on expanding his team, making public his desire to return to IndyCar racing as a front running team owner.  Prior to the start of the 2010 IZOD IndyCar season, de Ferran merged his team with Luczo Dragon Racing, a team started by [[Jay Penske]], the son of de Ferran\u2019s former boss [[Roger Penske]], and [[Steve Luczo]], a successful technology leader and racing enthusiast.  The new team was named de Ferran Dragon Racing and is the realization of de Ferran\u2019s ambition to return to IndyCar.\n\nDe Ferran Dragon Racing, with driver Raphael Matos, earned four Top Ten finishes in its debut campaign and led 15 laps during the season finale at Homestead-Miami Speedway.\n\nIn 2010, IndyCar also began planning for a completely new car concept, to debut during the 2012 season.  Due to his technical knowledge, motorsports experience across different series and roles, as well as the widespread respect he holds within the racing industry, de Ferran was chosen by his team owner peers to represent their interests in the development of the future IndyCar.  As part of the ICONIC committee, who created the concept for the future of IndyCar Racing.\n\nIn 2011 de Ferran Dragon racing closed its doors due to lack of funding, having attempted to stay operational for the new season.\n\n==Recognition==\n\nIn July 2013, Autosport magazine named De Ferran one of the 50 greatest drivers to have never raced in Formula One.\n\n==Personal life==\n\nDe Ferran currently lives in [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida]] with his English wife Angela and children Anna (born 1995) and Luke (born 1997).\n\n==Motorsports career results==\n\n===Complete International Formula 3000 results===\n([[:Template:Motorsport driver results legend|key]]) (Races in '''bold''' indicate pole position) (Races\nin ''italics'' indicate fastest lap)\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center; font-size:90%\"\n!

2001]]\n[[Image:Gil de Ferran waving.jpg|thumb|De Ferran at the [[2005 United States Grand Prix]]]]\n'''Gil de Ferran''' (born November 11, 1967 in [[Paris]], [[France]]) is a French-born Brazilian professional racing driver and team owner. De Ferran was the 2000 and 2001 [[Champ Car]] champion driving for [[Team Penske]] and the winner of the [[2003 Indianapolis 500]]. He also finished runner-up in the [[American Le Mans Series]] LMP1 class with his own [[de Ferran Motorsports]].\n\n==Early career==\n\nInspired by the success of fellow Brazilian [[Emerson Fittipaldi]], de Ferran began his career in [[kart racing]] in the early 1980s. He graduated to Formula Ford level in 1987 and [[Formula Three]] in 1991. Driving for [[Edenbridge Racing]], De Ferran finished the [[1991 British Formula Three season]] in third, only behind [[Rubens Barrichello]] and [[David Coulthard]].  For the [[1992 British Formula Three season|1992]] season, De Ferran moved to [[Paul Stewart Racing]] and won the title, scoring seven wins in the process.\n\n1993 and 1994 were spent driving for Paul Stewart Racing in [[International Formula 3000]]. De Ferran finished fourth in the series in 1993 and then took the championship down to the wire in 1994, ultimately finishing third.  In 1993, De Ferran tested for a day the [[Footwork Arrows]] [[Formula One]] team along with Dutch racer [[Jos Verstappen]].  His day was seriously compromised after he bumped his head while walking nearby the motorhome.  His times also compared poorly to Verstappen's.\n\n==CART==\n\nAt the end of 1994, de Ferran was invited to test a [[Champ Car|CAR]]T by [[Jim Hall (racing driver)|Hall/VDS Racing]]. Despite the worries of the team's sponsor [[Pennzoil]] that de Ferran was not famous enough name for their car, the team was sufficiently impressed to offer de Ferran a drive for 1995. With no top-line [[Formula One]] drive available de Ferran took up the offer to drive in America.\n\nDe Ferran won the rookie of the year award in 1995 by finishing 14th. He scored his first [[Champ Car|CAR]]T win in the last race of the year at [[Laguna Seca Raceway]].\n\nIn 1996, de Ferran was a consistent challenger but only scored one win, at Cleveland. This win was the last for veteran car owner and driver [[Jim Hall (racing driver)|Jim Hall]] who retired from the sport at the end of 1996. Hall's retirement also spelled the end of the Pennzoil Hall team. Despite rumours that he would be a driver for the new [[Stewart Grand Prix]] Formula One team, de Ferran stayed in America for 1997, joining [[Walker Racing]].\n\nDe Ferran finished 1997 as runner-up to [[Alex Zanardi]] with ten top-ten finishes but failed to score a single victory. He looked on course to win the season opener at [[Homestead-Miami Speedway|Homestead]] but was knocked out of the lead by a lapped driver, [[Dennis Vitolo]]. At the [[Grand Prix of Portland]] he lost out to [[PacWest Racing]]'s [[Mark Blundell]] in the closest finish in CART history.\n\nThe expected championship challenge never materialized in 1998. Unreliability, driver errors and the inferior performance of the [[Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company|Goodyear]] tires compared to the [[Firestone Tire and Rubber Company|Firestone]] tires all combined to leave de Ferran 12th in the standings, again with no wins in the year.\n\nIn 1999 the breakthrough finally came as de Ferran beat [[Juan Pablo Montoya]] at Portland to take his first win since mid-1996 and the Walker team's first since early-1995. However that victory would be the end of an era as Goodyear and [[Valvoline]] both left CART racing at the end of 1999. Toward the end of that season, de Ferran and [[Greg Moore (racing driver)|Greg Moore]] were signed to [[Penske Racing|Marlboro Team Penske]] to replace [[Al Unser, Jr.]] and the rotating arrangement of drivers employed after [[Andr\u00e9 Ribeiro (racing driver)|Andre Ribeiro]] retired. However, Moore was killed in a crash in the season finale and de Ferran's fellow countryman [[H\u00e9lio Castroneves]] joined him.\n\nOn October 28, 2000, during CART qualifying at [[California Speedway]], de Ferran set the track record for fastest lap at {{convert|241.428|mi/h|km/h|3|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite news|title=De Ferran wins pole, sets record|url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2000/oct/28/de-ferran-wins-pole-sets-record|newspaper=[[Las Vegas Sun]]|date=October 28, 2000|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110003755/http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2000/oct/28/de-ferran-wins-pole-sets-record|archivedate=November 10, 2013|url-status=live}}</ref> As of August 2018, this stands as the fastest qualifying lap speed ever recorded at an official race meeting.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prnmag.com/opinions-commentary/553-who-holds-the-worlds-closed-course-record-aj-foyt|title=Who holds the world's closed course record?

His analytical approach earned him comparisons with Penske's first driver, [[Mark Donohue]]. He also garnered praise for his politeness and integrity: when Penske switched to the [[Indy Racing League]] in 2002, he did not criticize the move even though it meant he could not defend his Champ Car title.\n\nIn 2003, de Ferran was injured during a race at [[Phoenix Raceway|Phoenix]], suffering a broken back. Despite the injury, de Ferran passed his teammate, Castroneves with 31 laps left to win an emotional victory at the [[2003 Indianapolis 500]]. It also was the second 1-2 finish for Penske Racing in the Indianapolis 500.\n\nFollowing his Indianapolis triumph de Ferran decided to retire at the end of 2003. He won his final race, although the moment was soured by a terrifying crash during the race that left fellow Indy winner [[Kenny Br\u00e4ck]] seriously injured.\n\n==Formula One managerial career==\n\nIn 2005, he moved to the [[British American Racing|BAR-Honda]] Formula One team as their Sports Director.

{"title_page": "Online gender-based violence", "text_new": "[[File:Online harassment of women journalists.png|thumb|A graphic created by UNESCO to demonstrate some of the forms of harassment that women experience online]]\n'''Online gender-based violence''' is targeted [[harassment]] and [[prejudice]] against women through technology. The term is also similar to online harassment, [[cyberbullying]] and cybersexism, but the latter terms are not gender specific. Gender-based violence differs from these because of the attention it draws to discrimination and online violence targeted specifically against those who identify as female. Online gender-based violence can include unwanted sexual remarks, non-consensual posting of sexual media, [[threat]]<nowiki/>s, [[doxing]], [[cyberstalking]] and harassment, and gender-based discriminatory memes and posts among other things. Online gender based violence derives from gender based violence but it is perpetuated through electronic means.\n== Forms ==\nSince the introduction of the internet, the presence of online gender-based violence has grown exponentially. While online gender-based violence can target anyone, it disproportionately targets hose who identify as female. This violence and targeted harassment comes in many forms. One common space where online gender based violence occurs is in the [[blogosphere]]. This is a male dominated space where female bloggers are criticized at a higher rate than male bloggers. There are frequently comments under female written blogs which are sexually violent in nature.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mathieu|first=Stephanie|date=May 2011|title=MISOGYNY ON THE WEB: COMPARING NEGATIVE READER COMMENTS MADE TO MEN AND WOMEN WHO PUBLISH POLITICAL COMMENTARY ONLINE|url=https://mospace.umsystem.edu/xmlui/bitstream/handle/10355/11494/research.pdf?sequen|journal=University of Missouri-Columbia|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref>  Another common place where online gender-based violence takes place is in the form of [[Internet troll|trolling]]. This includes derogatory comments and sexist, inflammatory comments. This is online gender based violence masked as a harmless, aimless activity. It also includes cyber-sexism played off as humorous and harmless when in reality it reinforces harmful [[stereotype]]s, [[violence]], and gender based [[power structure]]s that dominant both the offline and online world.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Poland|first=Bailey|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/j.ctt1fq9wdp|title=Haters|date=2016-11-01|publisher=Potomac Books|isbn=978-1-61234-872-8}}</ref> [[Meme]]s are another form through which online gender-based violence is spread. These are images created to present sexist jokes, [[sexual violence]], and gender stereotypes while playing it off as simply something humorous. [[Hashtag]]s are used in order to make sexist commentary and topics go viral, which then inserts sexist ideology into the mainstream social media.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://gap.hks.harvard.edu/perpetuating-online-sexism-offline-anonymity-interactivity-and-effects-sexist-hashtags-social-media|title=Perpetuating online sexism offline: Anonymity, interactivity, and the effects of sexist hashtags on social media {{!}} Gender Action Portal|website=gap.hks.harvard.edu|access-date=2020-04-16}}</ref>\n\n== Types ==\nWithin the broader definition, there are various types of online gender-based violence. One type is online [[domestic violence]], where perpetrators use the internet to [[exploit]]{{dn|date=April 2020}} the intimate and private knowledge that they have of their partner in order to hurt them. They also use intimate photos and videos to assert power and violence over their partner.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite journal|last=Suzor|first=Nicolas|last2=Dragiewicz|first2=Molly|last3=Harris|first3=Bridget|last4=Gillett|first4=Rosalie|last5=Burgess|first5=Jean|last6=Van Geelen|first6=Tess|date=2018-09-29|title=Human Rights by Design: The Responsibilities of Social Media Platforms to Address Gender-Based Violence Online|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/poi3.185|journal=Policy & Internet|volume=11|issue=1|pages=84\u2013103|doi=10.1002/poi3.185|issn=1944-2866}}</ref> [[Cyberstalking]] is another type of online gender-based violence. It has been reported that 26% of women aged 18\u201324 have reported being stalked through the use of [[telecommunication]] tools afforded by the [[internet]] and [[social media]].<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n== Causes ==\nOnline gender-based violence emerges from [[misogyny]] in physical spaces and the cultural norms that guide our lives. Accepted forms of gender-based violence include in-person contact such as: [[intimate partner violence]], [[street harassment]], [[rape]], and others described in [[violence against women]]. All of these have resulted in the creation of online forms of gender-based violence. Other causes of violence include the practices of [[Online community|Online communities]] and lack of regulations that address gender specific harassment and violence in these communities.\n\n=== Cultural ===\nThe societal acceptance of norms that are deemed \u2018misogynistic\u2019 has a large impact on the prevalence of gender-based violence online. Cultural norms and beliefs are carried from physical communities into online spaces by actors who engage in this behavior in person or who already agree with misogynist ideas.

This would include cases where the victim is working in politics or the threats and violent behavior came as a response to a political post.<ref name=\":1\">{{Cite web|url=https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2998181.2998213?casa_token=e6wCiXPDYE0AAAAA%3ACllMk1_oePC_WyOJ5DWdD1bQDiBkokeElMF0fAK0LJu_7-gzNNFRtfHFZi1H4UlC7mmcho2uSkI|title=Anyone Can Become a Troll|website=dl.acm.org|doi=10.1145/2998181.2998213|pmc=5791909|pmid=29399664|access-date=2020-04-16}}</ref>\n\n=== Algorithmic ===\nWhile cultural norms are one cause of gender violence that can attract some actors to perpetrate these behaviors, [[online algorithm]]s and behavior can bring about another factor that causes violent behavior.

These online threats translated into the personal lives of the women being attacked; many were forced to relocate, stay in close contact with the police, and cancel scheduled in-person events.

Gender-based violence differs from these because of the attention it draws to discrimination and online violence targeted specifically against those who identify as female. Online gender-based violence can include unwanted sexual remarks, non-consensual posting of sexual media, [[threat]]<nowiki/>s, [[doxing]], [[cyberstalking]] and harassment, and gender-based discriminatory memes and posts among other things. Online gender based violence derives from gender based violence but it is perpetuated through electronic means.\n== Forms ==\nSince the introduction of the internet, the presence of online gender-based violence has grown exponentially. While online gender-based violence can target anyone, it disproportionately targets hose who identify as female. This violence and targeted harassment comes in many forms. One common space where online gender based violence occurs is in the [[blogosphere]]. This is a male dominated space where female bloggers are criticized at a higher rate than male bloggers. There are frequently comments under female written blogs which are sexually violent in nature.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mathieu|first=Stephanie|date=May 2011|title=MISOGYNY ON THE WEB: COMPARING NEGATIVE READER COMMENTS MADE TO MEN AND WOMEN WHO PUBLISH POLITICAL COMMENTARY ONLINE|url=https://mospace.umsystem.edu/xmlui/bitstream/handle/10355/11494/research.pdf?sequen|journal=University of Missouri-Columbia|volume=|pages=|via=}}</ref>  Another common place where online gender-based violence takes place is in the form of [[Internet troll|trolling]]. This includes derogatory comments and sexist, inflammatory comments. This is online gender based violence masked as a harmless, aimless activity.

One type is online [[domestic violence]], where perpetrators use the internet to [[exploit]]{{dn|date=April 2020}} the intimate and private knowledge that they have of their partner in order to hurt them.

Accepted forms of gender-based violence include in-person contact such as: [[intimate partner violence]], [[street harassment]], [[rape]], and others described in [[violence against women]]. All of these have resulted in the creation of online forms of gender-based violence. Other causes of violence include the practices of [[Online community|Online communities]] and lack of regulations that address gender specific harassment and violence in these communities.\n\n=== Cultural ===\nThe societal acceptance of norms that are deemed \u2018misogynistic\u2019 has a large impact on the prevalence of gender-based violence online. Cultural norms and beliefs are carried from physical communities into online spaces by actors who engage in this behavior in person or who already agree with misogynist ideas.

Barnum]] and his troupe perform a show at the circus (\"The Greatest Show (Part 1)\").\n\nAs a child, Barnum and his tailor father Philo work for the Hallett family. He loves their daughter Charity who is being sent to [[finishing school]]. The two keep in touch through letters (\"A Million Dreams\"), eventually marrying and raising two daughters, Caroline and Helen, in New York City. They live a humble life; though Charity is happy, Barnum craves more.\n\nBarnum loses his job as a clerk at a shipping company after the company goes bankrupt, and returns home for Caroline's birthday (\"A Million Dreams (Reprise)\"). He takes out a loan from a bank, deceiving them into accepting his former employer's lost ships as collateral. He uses this loan to set up [[Barnum's American Museum]] in downtown Manhattan, an attraction showcasing various wax models. Initially, sales are slow. On the suggestion of his children to showcase something \"alive\", Barnum searches for \"freaks\" to serve as performers for his museum (\"Come Alive\"). He gathers a large group of them, including [[bearded lady]] Lettie Lutz. This attracts a large audience despite protests and poor reviews from well-known critic [[James Gordon Bennett Sr.|James Gordon Bennett]], prompting Barnum to rename his venture \"Barnum's Circus\".\n\nSearching for ways to further his reputation, Barnum meets playwright Phillip Carlyle and convinces him to join his venture (\"The Other Side\"). Phillip is mesmerized by the African American trapeze artist Anne Wheeler, but he hides his feelings. During a trip, Phillip arranges for Barnum and his troupe to meet [[Queen Victoria]]. Afterwards, Barnum convinces famed Swedish singer [[Jenny Lind]] to perform in America with him as her manager. Lind's first American performance is a rousing success (\"Never Enough\"); during the song, Phillip and Anne are spotted by Phillip's parents as they are holding hands. As Barnum gains favor with the aristocratic patrons, he begins to distance himself from his troupe as he advises them to work on their performances without him. Dejected, they decide to stand against their local harassers (\"This Is Me\").\n\nPhillip and Anne attend the theatre but they run into Phillip's parents, who chastise Phillip for \"parading around with the help\". Anne runs off, and Phillip angrily berates them, then chases Anne and tries to convince her that they can be together, but she rejects him (\"[[Rewrite the Stars]]\"). As Barnum takes Lind on a US tour, Charity feels isolated from her husband as she stays home with their daughters (\"Tightrope\"). While on tour, Lind begins falling in love with Barnum. When he refuses her advances, she threatens to quit and orchestrates a kiss with him at the end of her last show, which is photographed by the press (\"Never Enough (Reprise)\").\n\nBarnum returns home to find his circus on fire, caused by a fight between the protesters and the troupe. Phillip runs into the burning building, believing that Anne is still inside, and suffers serious injuries before being rescued by Barnum. Barnum gets word from a sympathetic Bennett that the culprits have been caught and that Lind has canceled her tour after her and Barnum's \"scandal\". Barnum's mansion is foreclosed upon and Charity takes their daughters to her parents' home.\n\nDevastated by his selfishness, Barnum retreats to a local bar where his troupe find him and explain that despite their disappointments, they still consider themselves a family that needs him. Inspired, he resolves to start a new show and not let ambition overtake his love (\"From Now On\"). Phillip wakes in a hospital with Anne by his side. Barnum finds Charity and they mend their relationship.\n\nBarnum is faced with the financial difficulty of rebuilding the circus, but the recovering Phillip steps in, offering to use his share of the circus's profits to rebuild it under condition of becoming a full partner, which Barnum happily accepts. To save money, Barnum transforms the enterprise into an open-air tent circus by the docks.\n\nThe revamped circus is a huge success (\"The Greatest Show (Part 2)\"). Barnum gives full control of the show to Phillip to spend more time with his family.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast list|\n* [[Hagh Juckman]] as [[P.&nbsp;T.

Barnum]] and his troupe perform a show at the circus (\"The Greatest Show (Part 1)\").\n\nAs a child, Barnum and his tailor father Philo work for the Hallett family. He loves their daughter Charity who is being sent to [[finishing school]]. The two keep in touch through letters (\"A Million Dreams\"), eventually marrying and raising two daughters, Caroline and Helen, in New York City. They live a humble life; though Charity is happy, Barnum craves more.\n\nBarnum loses his job as a clerk at a shipping company after the company goes bankrupt, and returns home for Caroline's birthday (\"A Million Dreams (Reprise)\"). He takes out a loan from a bank, deceiving them into accepting his former employer's lost ships as collateral. He uses this loan to set up [[Barnum's American Museum]] in downtown Manhattan, an attraction showcasing various wax models. Initially, sales are slow. On the suggestion of his children to showcase something \"alive\", Barnum searches for \"freaks\" to serve as performers for his museum (\"Come Alive\"). He gathers a large group of them, including [[bearded lady]] Lettie Lutz. This attracts a large audience despite protests and poor reviews from well-known critic [[James Gordon Bennett Sr.|James Gordon Bennett]], prompting Barnum to rename his venture \"Barnum's Circus\".\n\nSearching for ways to further his reputation, Barnum meets playwright Phillip Carlyle and convinces him to join his venture (\"The Other Side\"). Phillip is mesmerized by the African American trapeze artist Anne Wheeler, but he hides his feelings. During a trip, Phillip arranges for Barnum and his troupe to meet [[Queen Victoria]]. Afterwards, Barnum convinces famed Swedish singer [[Jenny Lind]] to perform in America with him as her manager. Lind's first American performance is a rousing success (\"Never Enough\"); during the song, Phillip and Anne are spotted by Phillip's parents as they are holding hands. As Barnum gains favor with the aristocratic patrons, he begins to distance himself from his troupe as he advises them to work on their performances without him. Dejected, they decide to stand against their local harassers (\"This Is Me\").\n\nPhillip and Anne attend the theatre but they run into Phillip's parents, who chastise Phillip for \"parading around with the help\". Anne runs off, and Phillip angrily berates them, then chases Anne and tries to convince her that they can be together, but she rejects him (\"[[Rewrite the Stars]]\"). As Barnum takes Lind on a US tour, Charity feels isolated from her husband as she stays home with their daughters (\"Tightrope\"). While on tour, Lind begins falling in love with Barnum. When he refuses her advances, she threatens to quit and orchestrates a kiss with him at the end of her last show, which is photographed by the press (\"Never Enough (Reprise)\").\n\nBarnum returns home to find his circus on fire, caused by a fight between the protesters and the troupe. Phillip runs into the burning building, believing that Anne is still inside, and suffers serious injuries before being rescued by Barnum. Barnum gets word from a sympathetic Bennett that the culprits have been caught and that Lind has canceled her tour after her and Barnum's \"scandal\". Barnum's mansion is foreclosed upon and Charity takes their daughters to her parents' home.\n\nDevastated by his selfishness, Barnum retreats to a local bar where his troupe find him and explain that despite their disappointments, they still consider themselves a family that needs him. Inspired, he resolves to start a new show and not let ambition overtake his love (\"From Now On\"). Phillip wakes in a hospital with Anne by his side. Barnum finds Charity and they mend their relationship.\n\nBarnum is faced with the financial difficulty of rebuilding the circus, but the recovering Phillip steps in, offering to use his share of the circus's profits to rebuild it under condition of becoming a full partner, which Barnum happily accepts. To save money, Barnum transforms the enterprise into an open-air tent circus by the docks.\n\nThe revamped circus is a huge success (\"The Greatest Show (Part 2)\"). Barnum gives full control of the show to Phillip to spend more time with his family.\n\n==Cast==\n{{cast list|\n* [[Hugh Jackman]] as [[P.&nbsp;T.

A gay icon can either be a part of the LGBT community or heterosexual, but heterosexual gay icons are often highly supportive of their fans within the community and the rights of LGBT people. Organizations such as [[GLAAD]] routinely recognize public figures for their contributions and support for the LGBT community. Gay icons exist across cultures, most prominently in North and South America, Europe, and Asia.\n\nMany gay icons are celebrities in the entertainment industry, but can also include figures in politics, history, sports, literature, and other mediums. Prominent entertainers considered to be gay icons often incorporate themes of acceptance, self-love, and sexuality in their work. Gay icons of all orientations have acknowledged the role that their gay fans have played in their success, including [[Bette Midler]], [[Cher]], [[Diana Ross]], [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], [[Mariah Carey]], and [[Lady Gaga]].

A gay icon can either be a part of the LGBT community or heterosexual, but heterosexual gay icons are often highly supportive of their fans within the community and the rights of LGBT people. Organizations such as [[GLAAD]] routinely recognize public figures for their contributions and support for the LGBT community. Gay icons exist across cultures, most prominently in North and South America, Europe, and Asia.\n\nMany gay icons are celebrities in the entertainment industry, but can also include figures in politics, history, sports, literature, and other mediums. Prominent entertainers considered to be gay icons often incorporate themes of acceptance, self-love, and sexuality in their work. Gay icons of all orientations have acknowledged the role that their gay fans have played in their success, including [[Bette Midler]], [[Cher]], [[Diana Ross]], [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], [[Mariah Carey]], and [[Lady Gaga]].
