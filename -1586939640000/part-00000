A separate Department of Defence Research and Development was formed in 1980 which later on administered DRDO and its 50 laboratories/establishments. Most of the time the Defence Research Development Organisation was treated as if it was a vendor and the Army Headquarters or the Air Headquarters were the customers. Because the Army and the Air Force themselves did not have any design or construction responsibility, they tended to treat the designer or Indian industry at par with their corresponding designer in the world market. If they could get a [[MiG-21]] from the world market, they wanted a MiG-21 from DRDO.<ref name=\"GS\">{{cite web |author=John Pike |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/india/drdo.htm |title=Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) |publisher=Globalsecurity.org |accessdate=31 August 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100423074603/http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/india/drdo.htm |archive-date=23 April 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nDRDO started its first major project in [[surface-to-air missile]]s (SAM) known as [[Project Indigo]] in 1960s. Indigo was discontinued in later years without achieving full success. Project Indigo led to [[Project Devil]], along with Project Valiant, to develop short-range SAM and [[ICBM]] in the 1970s. Project Devil itself led to the later development of the [[Prithvi (missile)|Prithvi]] missile under the [[Integrated Guided Missile Development Programme]] (IGMDP) in the 1980s. IGMDP was an Indian [[Ministry of Defence (India)|Ministry of Defence]] programme between the early 1980s and 2007 for the development of a comprehensive range of missiles, including the [[Agni missile]], Prithvi ballistic missile, [[Akash missile]], [[Trishul missile]] and [[Nag Missile]]. In 2010, defence minister [[A. K. Antony]] ordered the restructuring of the DRDO to give 'a major boost to defence research in the country and to ensure effective participation of the private sector in defence technology'. The key measures to make DRDO effective in its functioning include the establishment of a Defence Technology Commission with the defence minister as its chairman.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.defencetalk.com/mod-announces-major-drdo-restructuring-plan-26384/ |title=MoD Announces Major DRDO Restructuring Plan &#124; Defence & Security News at DefenceTalk |publisher=Defencetalk.com |date=17 May 2010 |access-date=31 August 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101129020637/http://www.defencetalk.com/mod-announces-major-drdo-restructuring-plan-26384/ |archivedate=29 November 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.defpro.com/news/details/15208/ |title=defence.professionals |publisher=defpro.com |accessdate=31 August 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110515212759/http://www.defpro.com/news/details/15208/ |archivedate=15 May 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The programmes which were largely managed by DRDO have seen considerable success with many of the systems seeing rapid deployment as well as yielding significant technological benefits.

Systems developed by DRDO include radar warning receivers, radar and display computers. DRDO's radar computers, manufactured by HAL are also being fitted into Malaysian [[Su-30]]s.\n* The DRDO is part of the [[Indian Air Force]]'s upgrade programmes for its [[MiG-27]] and [[Sepecat Jaguar]] combat aircraft, along with the manufacturer [[Hindustan Aeronautics Limited]]. DRDO and HAL have been responsible for the system design and integration of these upgrades, which combine indigenously developed systems along with imported ones.

The aim is to develop a long-range system able to strike at a range of 100\u2013120&nbsp;km, with each rocket in the system, having a payload of up to 250&nbsp;kg. The new MBRS's rocket will have a maximum speed of 4.7 mach and will rise to an altitude of 40&nbsp;km, before hitting its target at 1.8 mach. There is also a move to put a sophisticated new inertial guidance system on the rockets whilst keeping cost constraints in mind.

This was the first high power radar developed by the DRDO, with the Indra-I radar for the Indian Army, followed by Indra Pulse Compression (PC) version for the Indian Air Force, also known as the Indra-II, which is a low level radar to search and track low flying cruise missiles, helicopters and aircraft. These are 2D radars that provide range and azimuth information and are meant to be used as gap fillers. The Indra 2 PC has pulse compression providing improved range resolution. The series is used both by the [[Indian Air Force]] and the [[Indian Army]]\n*[[File:Rajendra Radar.jpg|thumb|[[Rajendra Radar|Rajendra fire control radar]] at Adamya Chaitanya Exhibition 2016]][[Rajendra Radar|Rajendra fire control radar]] for the [[Akash missile|Akash SAM]]: The Rajendra is stated to be ready. However, it can be expected that further iterative improvements will be made. The Rajendra is a high power [[Passive electronically scanned array]] radar (PESA), with the ability able to guide up to 12 Akash SAMs against aircraft flying at low to medium altitudes. The Rajendra has a detection range of 80&nbsp; km with 18&nbsp; km height coverage against small fighter-sized targets and is able to track 64 targets, engaging 4 simultaneously, with up to 3 missiles per target. The Rajendra features a fully digital high-speed signal processing system with an adaptive moving target indicator, coherent signal processing, FFTs, and variable pulse repetition frequency. The entire PESA antenna array can swivel 360 degrees on a rotating platform. This allows the radar antenna to be rapidly repositioned and even conduct all-round surveillance.\n* [[Central Acquisition Radar (3D-CAR)|Central Acquisition Radar]], a state of the art planar array S-band radar operating on the stacked beam principle. With a range of 180&nbsp;km, it can [[track while scan]] 200 fighter-sized targets. Its systems are integrated on high mobility, locally built TATRA trucks for the Army and Air Force; however, it is meant to be used by all three services. Initially developed for the long-running Akash SAM system, seven were ordered by the Indian Air Force for their radar modernization program and two of another variants were ordered by the Indian Navy for their P-28 Corvettes.

Up to 10 BFSR-SR can be networked together for network-centric operation. It is in use with the [[Indian Army]] and the [[Border Security Force|BSF]] as well as export customers.\n* Super Vision-2000, an airborne 3D naval surveillance radar, meant for helicopters and light transport aircraft. This program was subsequently superseded by the advanced XV-2004 which offered a more sophisticated architecture able to handle SAR and ISAR modes. The SV-2000 is a lightweight, high performance, slotted array radar operating in the X-Band. It can detect sea-surface targets such as a periscope or a vessel against heavy clutter and can also be used for navigation, weather mapping, and beacon detection. The radar can detect a large vessel at over 100 nautical miles (370&nbsp; km). It is currently under modification to be fitted to the Advanced Light Helicopter and the Navy's Do-228's. Variants can be fitted to the Navy's Ka-25's as well. A more advanced variant of the Super Vision, known as the XV-2004 is now in trials and features an ISAR, SAR Capability intended for the Indian Navy's helicopter fleet.\n* [[Swordfish Long Range Tracking Radar]], a 3D AESA was developed with assistance from [[Elta]] of [[Israel]] and is similar to Elta's proven GreenPine long-range Active Array radar. The DRDO developed the signal processing and software for tracking high-speed ballistic missile targets as well as introduced more ruggedization. The radar uses mostly Indian designed and manufactured components such as its critical high power, L Band Transmit-Receive modules and other enabling technologies necessary for active phased array radars. The LRTR can track 200 targets and has a range of above 500&nbsp; km. It can detect [[Intermediate-range ballistic missile]]. The LRTR would be amongst the key elements of the [[Indian Ballistic Missile Defence Programme]]. DRDO would provide the technology to private and public manufacturers to make these high power systems.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.hindu.com/2005/04/15/stories/2005041509810400.htm |title=Details of LRTR from 2004 |publisher=Hindu.com |date=15 April 2005 |accessdate=31 August 2010 |location=Chennai, India |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100809122055/http://www.hindu.com/2005/04/15/stories/2005041509810400.htm |archivedate=9 August 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n* 3D Multi-Function Control Radar (MFCR) was developed as part of the Indian anti-ballistic missile program in cooperation with [[Thales Group|THALES]] of France. The MFCR is an active phased array radar and complements the ''Swordfish Long Range Tracking Radar'', for intercepting ballistic missiles. The MFCR will also serve as the fire control radar for the AAD second-tier missile system of the ABM program. The AAD has a supplementary role against aircraft as well and can engage missiles and aircraft up to an altitude of 30&nbsp; km. The MFCR fills out the final part of the DRDO's radar development spectrum and allows India to manufacture long-range 3D radars that can act as the nodes of an Air Defence Ground Environment system.\n* 2D Low-Level Lightweight Radar (LLLWR) for the Indian Army, known as the Bharani, which requires many of these units for gap-filling in mountainous terrain and has been ordered into production after clearing Indian Army trials. The Indian Air Force will also acquire a more advanced unit, called the Aslesha. The LLLWR is a 2D radar with a range of 40&nbsp; km against a 2 square meter target, intended as a gap-filler to plug detection gaps versus low-level aircraft in an integrated Air Defence Ground network. The LLLWR makes use of Indra-2 technology, namely a similar antenna array, but has roughly half the range and is much smaller and a far more portable unit. The LLLWR can [[track while scan]] 100 targets and provide details about their speed, azimuth, and range to the operator. The LLLWR makes use of the BFSR-SR experience and many of the subsystem providers are the same. Multiple LLLWRs can be networked together. The LLLWR is meant to detect low-level intruders, and will alert Army Air Defence fire control units to cue their weapon systems.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://media.bharat-rakshak.com/aero/main.php?g2_itemId=1355 |title=LLLR Specifications |publisher=Media.bharat-rakshak.com |date=18 January 2007 |accessdate=31 August 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071021103105/http://media.bharat-rakshak.com/aero/main.php?g2_itemId=1355 |archivedate=21 October 2007 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n* 3D Short-Range Radar for the Indian Air Force \u2013 ASLESHA: The ASLESHA radars have a range of approximately 50&nbsp; km against small fighter-sized targets and will be able to determine their range, speed, azimuth, and height. This radar will enable the Indian Air Force Air Defence units to accurately track low-level intruders. The radar is a semi-active phased array with a 1-meter square aperture. The DRDO was in discussions with the Indian Navy to mount these systems on small ships.\n* Multi-mode radar, a 3D radar is a HAL project with DRDO's LRDE as a subsystem provider. This project to develop an advanced, lightweight Multi-mode fire control radar for the [[LCA Tejas]] fighter had faced challenges and was delayed and finally superseded by a program called the Uttam to develop an AESA FCR for the Tejas LCA. The MMR program was finally completed with Elta's (Israel) assistance and became a hybrid system incorporating the original DRDO antenna, gimbal stabilization, and Israeli backend. The multi-mode radar has the range (for detection of a small fighter target) around 100&nbsp; km can track 10 targets, can engage 2 targets and uses the lightweight system. Originally, DRDO developed an all-new combined signal and the data processor had been developed, replacing the original separate units. The new unit is much more powerful and makes use of contemporary ADSP processors. The radar's critical hardware was also developed and validated. The software for the air-to-air mode has been developed considerably (including search and track while scan in both look up and look down modes) but air-to-ground modes were still being worked upon and proved problematic. The radar development was shown to be considerably more mature than previously thought but still faced significant delays and challenges. At Aero India 2009, it was revealed that the 3D MMR project has been superseded by the new 3D AESA FCR project led by LRDE. The MMR has been completed with Elta Israel's assistance and now involved [[Elta]] [[EL/M-2032]] technology for Air-to-Ground mapping and targeting \u2013 in order to simplify testing, the Hybrid MMR basically became an Indian variant of the EL/M-2032 with an Indian antenna and gimbal system as Elta pointed out mixing and matching Indian hardware with Israeli software would, in essence, mean a new design with a significant time impact. The \"hybrid\" MMR has been tested, validated and will be supplied for the initial [[LCA Tejas]] fighters.\n* DRDO has indigenized components and improved subsystems of various other license-produced radars manufactured at [[Bharat Electronics Limited|BEL]] with the help of BEL scientists and other researchers. These improvements include new radar data processors for license-produced signal radars as well as local radar assemblies replacing the earlier imported ones.\n* [[BEL Weapon Locating Radar]]:[[File:Weapon Locating Radar (Swathi) passes through the Rajpath, on the occasion of the 69th Republic Day Parade 2018, in New Delhi on January 26, 2018.jpg|thumb|BEL Weapon Locating Radar (Swathi) passes on the occasion of the 69th Republic Day Parade 2018.]]Swati, a 3D radar developed from the Rajendra fire-control radar for the Akash system, uses a [[passive electronically scanned array]] to detect multiple targets for fire correction and weapon location.

The Indian Army has ordered 28 of these units. \n* 3D Tactical Control Radar: a new program, the TCR is an approximately 90&nbsp; km ranged system for use by the Indian Army. A highly mobile unit, it is a variant of the 3D CAR unit and packaged into 2 as verses 3 units. The Indian Army has ordered many of the types for its Air Defense Units.\n\nApart from the above, the DRDO has also several other radar systems currently under development or in trials, these include:\n\n* Active Phased Array radar: a 3D radar for fighters, an MMR follow on, the APAR project aims to field a fully-fledged operational AESA fire control radar for the expected Mark-2 version of the [[Light Combat Aircraft]]. This will be the second airborne AESA program after the AEW&C project and intends to replicate DRDO's success with the ground-based radar segment to airborne systems. The overall airborne APAR program aims to prevent this technology gap from developing, with a broad-based program to bring DRDO up to par with international developers in airborne systems, both fire control, and surveillance. As of 2016, the radar was still in development, with variants expected to be fielded on future IAF fighters like the MCA or Tejas advanced Marks.\n* [[Synthetic aperture radar]] & [[Inverse synthetic aperture radar]]: the DRDO's LRDE is currently working on both SAR and ISAR radars for target detection and classification. These lightweight payloads are intended for both conventional fixed wing as well as [[Unmanned Aerial Vehicle|UAV]] applications.\n* Airborne Warning and Control: a new radar-based on [[active electronically scanned array]] technology. The aim of the project is to develop an in-house capability for high power AEW&C systems, with the system covering the development of an S-Band AESA array. The aircraft will also have data-links to link fighters plus communicate with the IAF's C3I infrastructure as well as a local SATCOM (satellite communication system), along with other onboard ESM and COMINT systems.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.blonnet.com/2006/01/25/stories/2006012501641500.htm |title=Aircraft for AWACS to be chosen by the IAF |publisher=Blonnet.com |date=25 January 2006 |accessdate=31 August 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100813033613/http://www.blonnet.com/2006/01/25/stories/2006012501641500.htm |archivedate=13 August 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> As of 2016, the system was in advanced trials and had achieved a TRL (Technical Readiness Level) of 8/10 with trials focusing on proving its self-protection equipment.\n* Medium-Range Battlefield Surveillance Radar: in 2009, the LRDE (DRDO) noted that it was working on a ''Long-range'' battlefield surveillance radar. It is possible that the BFSR-LR project has replaced this earlier project and the [[Indian Army]] will utilize the BEL built [[ELTA]] designed BFSR-MR's for Medium-Range surveillance while using the LRDE designed systems for Long Range surveillance. The 2D radar was to track ground targets and provide key intelligence to the Indian Army's artillery units, with the resultant information available on various tactical networks. As of 2016, this project was not active.\n* 3D Medium Power Radar: a spin-off of the experience gained via the 3D MFCR project, the 3D Medium Power Radar project is intended to field a radar with a range of approximately 300&nbsp; km against small fighter-sized targets. Intended for the Indian Air Force, the radar is an active phased array, and will be transportable. It will play a significant role being used as part of the nodes of the [[Indian Air Force]]'s enhanced Air Defence Ground Environment System. As of 2016, the radar was ready for IAF user trials and the IAF had ordered 8 MPRs already.\n* 3D Low-Level Transportable Radar: A new program, the LLTR is also called the Ashwini and is an approximately 200\u2013150&nbsp; km ranged system for use by the Indian  Air Force. A highly mobile unit, it will also employ AESA technology, and [[open architecture]] to provide easy upgrades and a variety of modes and capabilities depending on the software fit. The aim of the 3D Medium Power Radar and LLTR is to offer systems that can be deployed in a variety of roles, from fire control to surveillance, and not be tied to one role alone. As of 2016, the LLTR program was in an advanced stage and expected to reach the trials phase\n* 3D Army AD Fire Control Radar: A new program for the Indian Army, the Atulya FCR is intended to provide Army AD units with a compact fire control system for their armament. The Indian Army has a total requirement of over 60 FCRs.\n* 3D Army Multi-Mission Radar: A new program for the Indian Army, the mobile compact radar system is expected to be capable of both artillery detection and air defense missions. As of 2016, it was in an advanced stage of development, with basic design completed and realization of the prototype underway.\n\n====Command and control software and decision-making tools====\n* Tactical tools for wargaming: Shatranj and Sangram for the Army, Sagar for the Navy and air war software for the Air Force. All these systems are operational with the respective services.\n* C3I systems: DRDO, in cooperation with BEL and private industry has developed several critical C3I (command, control, communications and intelligence systems) for the armed services. Under the project \"Shakti\", the Indian Army aims to spend {{USD}}300 million to network all its artillery guns using the ACCS (Artillery Command and Control System). Developed by DRDO's Centre for Artificial Intelligence & Robotics, the system comprises computers and intelligent terminals connected as a wide area network. Its main subsystems are the artillery computer centre, battery computer, remote access terminal and a gun display unit. The ACCS is expected to improve the Army's artillery operations by a factor of 10 and allowing for more rapid and accurate firepower. The ACCS will also improve the ability of commanders to concentrate that fire-power where it is most needed. The DRDO and BEL have also developed a Battle Management system for the [[Indian Army]] for its tanks and tactical units.\n\nOther programmes in development for the Army include Corps level information and decision making software and tools, intended to link all units together for effective C3I. These systems are in production at DRDO's production partner, [[Bharat Electronics]]. These projects are being driven by the [[Indian Army Corps of Signals]]. The Indian Army is also moving towards extensive use of battlefield computers. DRDO has also delivered projects such as the Combat Net Radio for enhancing the Army's communication hardware.\n* Data management and command and control systems for the Navy have been provided by the DRDO. The Navy is currently engaged in a naval networking project to network all its ships and shore establishments plus maritime patrol aircraft and sensors.\n* Radar netting and multi-sensor fusion software for linking the Indian Air Force's network of radars and airbases which have been operationalised. Other systems include sophisticated and highly complex ''mission planning and C3I systems'' for missiles, such as the Agni and Prithvi ballistic missiles and the Brahmos cruise missile. These systems are common to all three services as all of them utilise different variants of these missiles.\n* Simulators and training tools: DRDO and private industry have collaborated on manufacturing a range of simulators and training devices for the three services, from entry level tests for prospective entrants to the Indian Air Force, to sophisticated simulators for fighter aircraft, transports and helicopters, tanks and gunnery devices.\n\n====Computing technologies====\n\nDRDO has worked extensively on high speed computing given its ramifications for most of its defence projects. These include supercomputers for computational flow dynamics, to dedicated microprocessor designs manufactured in India for flight controllers and the like, to high speed computing boards built around Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) components, similar to the latest trends in the defence industry.\n* Supercomputing: DRDO's ANURAG developed the PACE+<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hpcwire.com/archives/5465.html |title=Report from 1995 on the initial PACE system |publisher=Hpcwire.com |date=4 May 1995 |accessdate=31 August 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100809225656/http://www.hpcwire.com/archives/5465.html |archivedate=9 August 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Supercomputer for strategic purposes for supporting its various programmes. The initial version, as detailed in 1995, had the following specifications: The system delivered a sustained performance of more than 960 Mflops (million floating operations per second) for computational [[fluid dynamics]] programmes. Pace-Plus included 32 advanced computing nodes, each with 64 megabytes(MB) of memory that can be expanded up to 256MB and a powerful front-end processor which is a [[hyperSPARC]] with a speed of 66/90/100 megahertz (MHz). Besides fluid dynamics, these high-speed computer systems were used in areas such as vision, medical imaging, signal processing, molecular modeling, neural networks and finite element analysis. The latest variant of the PACE series is the PACE ++, a 128 node parallel processing system. With a front-end processor, it has a distributed memory and message passing system. Under Project '''Chitra''', the DRDO is implementing a system with a computational speed of 2-3 Teraflops utilising commercial off the shelf components and the Open Source Linux Operating System.\n* Processors and other critical items: DRDO has developed a range of processors and application specific integrated circuits for its critical projects. Many of these systems are modular, in the sense that they can be reused across different projects. These include \"Pythagoras processor\" to convert cartesian to polar coordinates, ANUCO, a floating point coprocessor and several others, including the ANUPAMA 32-bit processor, which is being used in several DRDO projects.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.electronicsforu.com/electronicsforu/articles/hits.asp?id=1106 |title=ANUPAMA processor |publisher=Electronicsforu.com |accessdate=31 August 2010}}</ref>\n* Electronic components: one of the endeavours undertaken by the DRDO has been to create a substantial local design and development capability within India, both in the private and public sectors. This policy has led to several hard to obtain or otherwise denied items, being designed and manufactured in India. These include components such as radar subsystems (product specific travelling wave tubes) to components necessary for electronic warfare and other cutting edge projects. Today, there are a range of firms across India, which design and manufacture key components for DRDO, allowing it to source locally for quite a substantial chunk of its procurement. The DRDO has also endeavoured to use COTS (Commercial off the shelf) processors and technology, and follow Open Architecture standards, wherever possible, in order to pre-empt obsolescence issues and follow industry practise. One significant example is the development of an Open Architecture computer for the Light Combat Aircraft, based on the PowerPC architecture and VME64 standard. Variants of the earlier Mission computer utilising Intel 486 DX chips are already present on the Su-30 MKI, Jaguar and MiG-27 Upgrades for the Indian Air Force.\n\n====Laser Science & Technology Centre (LASTEC)====\nDRDO is working on a slew of directed energy weapons (DEWs). LASTEC has identified DEWs, along with space security, cyber-security and hypersonic vehicles as focus areas in the next 15 years.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/DRDOs-next-Star-Wars-like-weapons/articleshow/6248942.cms#ixzz3qGVfeigT|title=DRDO's next: Star Wars-like weapons|publisher=The Times of India|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151020161307/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/DRDOs-next-Star-Wars-like-weapons/articleshow/6248942.cms#ixzz3qGVfeigT|archivedate=20 October 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The aim is to develop laser-based weapons, deployed on airborne as well as seaborne platforms, which can intercept missiles soon after they are launched towards India in the boost phase itself. These will be part of the ballistic missile defence system being currently developed by DRDO. LASTEC is developing a 25-kilowatt laser system to hit a missile during its terminal phase at a distance of 5\u20137&nbsp;km. LASTEC is also working on a vehicle-mounted gas dynamic laser-based DEW system, under project Aditya, which should be ready in three years. Project Aditya is a technology demonstrator to prove beam control technology. Ultimately, solid-state lasers would be used. For US President [[Donald Trump]] visit to India in 2020, DRDO deployed the LASTEC developed vehicle-mounted gas dynamic laser-based DEW system for counter-drone operations in [[Ahmedabad]] after completion of successful trial on February 21, 2020.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.livemint.com/news/india/how-this-drdo-made-weapon-will-safeguard-skies-during-trump-modi-s-roadshow-11582286736993.html|title=How this DRDO-made weapon will safeguard skies during Trump-Modi's roadshow|date=2020-02-21|website=Livemint|language=en|access-date=2020-03-06}}</ref> It can detect, identify and destroy low flying objects of smaller size carrying explosives or arms and ammunitions.

Local systems include the DRDO-developed [[Reactive armour|ERA]], a DRDO-developed laser warning system and combat net radio, the Bharat Electronics Limited advanced land navigation system consisting of fibre optic gyros and GPS, [[Weapon of mass destruction|NBC]] protection and DRDO's fire detection and suppression system amongst other items. Imported systems include a compact [[Thermographic camera|thermal imager]] and fire control system and a new 1000&nbsp;hp engine.\n* Anti-tank ammunition: DRDO developed the [[Kinetic energy penetrator|FSAPDS]] for the 125&nbsp;mm calibre, meant for India's T-72 tanks, the 120&nbsp;mm [[Kinetic energy penetrator|FSAPDS]] and [[High explosive squash head|HESH]] rounds for the [[Arjun MBT|Arjun tank]] and 105&nbsp;mm [[Kinetic energy penetrator|FSAPDS]] rounds for the Army's [[Vijayanta]] and [[T-55]] tanks. Significant amounts of 125&nbsp;mm anti-tank rounds manufactured by the Ordnance Factory Board were rejected. The problems were traced to improper packaging of the charges by the OFB, leading to propellant leakage during storage at high temperatures. The locally developed rounds were rectified and requalified. Production of these local rounds was then restarted. Since 2001, over {{formatnum:130000}} rounds have been manufactured by the OFB. The DRDO said in 2005 that it had developed a Mk2 version of the 125&nbsp;mm round, with higher power propellant for greater penetration. In parallel, the OFB announced in 2006 that it was also manufacturing 125&nbsp;mm IMI ([[Israel Military Industries]]) rounds. It is believed that this might assist in improving the OFB's APFSDS manufacturing capability.

The Army will deploy the Nag on ground-based launchers and from helicopters, whereas the Air Force will rely on helicopter based units. The Nag has an Imaging Infrared (IIR) seeker and has a top and direct attack capability, with a tandem warhead. The Army's land missile carrier and launcher, known as the Namica, carries several ready to use Nag missiles within and four Nag missiles in an extendable launcher above the turret. The Namica has its own FLIR based sighting and fire control unit.\n\n[[File:Nag with NAMICA Defexpo-2008.JPG|thumb|[[Nag missile]]]]\n\nThe Air Force and Army will also use their Advanced Light helicopters (ALH) ([[HAL Dhruv]]) and the [[HAL Light Combat Helicopter]] (LHC) as Nag carriers. The ALHs will be equipped with IRDE (DRDO) developed HELITIS (Heliborne Imaging and Targeting systems) with a combination of a FLIR and laser range finder in a stabilised turret for target acquisition and designation. The thermal imager is likely to be imported, but the gimballed turret, stabilisation, laser range finder and associated electronics have been designed in India and will be manufactured locally. The Nag ATGM is regarded as a highly capable missile, even though its development has been protracted, mainly due to the technological challenges of developing a state of the art IIR sensor equipped top attack missile. The Nag is still cheaper than most imported missiles in its category and is earmarked for the Army and Air Force.\n\nThe Nag anti-tank guided missile was cleared for production in July 2009 and there are uncorroborated reports since that it may be purchased by [[Tanzania]], [[Botswana]] and [[Morocco]].<ref name=\"export\">{{cite news|title=India seeks to boost military exports to Gulf|url=http://www.siliconindia.com/shownews/India_seeks_to_boost_military_exports_to_Gulf___-nid-18916.html|author=IANS|publisher=SiliconIndia.com|authorlink=Indo-Asian News Service|date=20 March 2003|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511105844/http://www.siliconindia.com/shownews/India_seeks_to_boost_military_exports_to_Gulf___-nid-18916.html|archivedate=11 May 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The Nag will complement the existing Russian [[9M113 Konkurs|9M113 Konkurs Anti-tank guided missile]] and European missile [[MILAN]] in Indian usage, both of which are manufactured under licence by Bharat Dynamics Limited.\n\n====Brahmos====\n{{main|BrahMos}}\n\nLaunched as a joint venture between India's DRDO and the Russian NPO, the BrahMos programme aims at creating a range of missile systems derived from the [[Yakhont]] missile system.

Similar to the BrahMos, Shaurya is stored in composite canisters, which makes it much easier to store for long periods without maintenance as well as to handle and transport. It also houses the gas generator to eject the missile from the canister before its solid propellant motors take over to hurl it at the intended target.\n\nShaurya missiles can remain hidden or camouflaged in underground silos from enemy surveillance or satellites till they are fired from the special storage-cum-launch canisters. The Shaurya system will require some more tests before it becomes fully operational in two to three years. Moreover, defence scientists say the high-speed, two-stage Shaurya has high maneuverability which also makes it less vulnerable to existing anti-missile defence systems.\n\nIt can be easily transported by road. The missile, encased in a canister, is mounted on a single vehicle, which has only a driver's cabin, and the vehicle itself is the launch platform. This \"single vehicle solution\" reduces its signature \u2013 it cannot be easily detected by satellites \u2013 and makes its deployment easy. The gas generator, located at the bottom of the canister produces high pressure gas, which expands and ejects the missile from the tube.\n\nThe centrepiece of a host of new technologies incorporated in Shaurya is its [[ring laser gyroscope]] (RLG) and [[accelerometer]]. The indigenous ring laser gyroscope, a sophisticated navigation and guidance system developed by the Research Centre Imarat (RCI) based in Hyderabad is a highly classified technology.\n\nIn test flights the RLG functioned exceptionally well. the RLG monitors the missile's position in space when it is flying. The missile's on-board computer will use this information and compare it with the desired position. Based on the difference between the missile's actual and desired positions, the computer will decide the optimum path and the actuators will command the missile to fly in its desired/targeted position.\nThe third test of the RLG was successful on 24 September 2011, reaching a speed of 7.5 mach. It is now ready for production.\n\n====Sagarika====\n{{main|Sagarika (missile)}}\n\nThe K-15 Sagarika is a nuclear-capable submarine-launched ballistic missile belonging to the [[K Missile family]] with a range of 750 kilometres (466&nbsp;mi). Sagarika can carry a payload of up to 500 kilograms (1,102&nbsp;lb). Sagarika was developed at the DRDO's missile complex in Hyderabad.\n\nThis missile will form part of the triad in India's nuclear deterrence, and will provide retaliatory nuclear strike capability. The development of this missile (under the title Project K-15) started in 1991. The Indian government first confirmed Sagarika's development seven years later (1998), when the then Defence Minister, George Fernandes, announced it during a press conference.\n\nThe development of the underwater missile launcher, known as Project 420 (P420), was completed in 2001 and handed over to the Indian Navy for trials. The missile was successfully test-fired six times, and tested to its full range up to three times. The test of missile from a submerged pontoon was conducted in February 2008.\n\nSagarika is being integrated with India's nuclear-powered [[Arihant class submarine]]s that began sea trials on 26 July 2009.\n\n====Prahaar====\n{{Main|Prahaar (missile)}}\n\nPrahaar is a solid-fueled surface-to-surface guided short-range tactical ballistic missile developed by DRDO of India.

While DRDO had revealed some details about the project over the years, its progress had been marked by strict secrecy, and the project itself was unlisted, and not visible among DRDO's other programmes. The ABM project has benefited from all the incremental improvements achieved by the DRDO and its associated industrial partners via the long-running and often contentious [[Akash missile]] and [[Trishul (missile)|Trishul]] missile programmes. However, it is a completely new programme, with much larger scope and with predominantly new subsystems.\n\nThe ABM project has two missiles\u2014namely the AAD (Advanced Air Defence) and PAD (Prithvi Air Defence) missiles. The former is an endo-atmospheric interceptor of new design, which can intercept targets to a height of {{convert|30|km|0|abbr=on}}. Whereas the latter is a modified Prithvi missile, dubbed the Axo-atmospheric interceptor (AXO) with a dedicated second stage kill vehicle for ballistic missile interception, up to an altitude of {{convert|80|km|0|abbr=on}}. Both these missiles are cued by an active phased array Long Range Tracking Radar, similar to the Elta GreenPine but made with locally developed components, which include DRDO-developed transmit/receive modules. The ABM system also makes use of a second radar, known as the Multi-Function Control Radar which assists the LRTR in classifying the target, and can also act as the fire control radar for the AAD missile. The MFCR, like the LRTR, is an active phased array system.\n\nThe entire system was tested in November 2006, under the Prithvi Air Defence Exercise, when a prototype AXO missile intercepted another [[Prithvi missile]] at a height of {{convert|50|km|0|abbr=on}}. This test was preceded by an \"electronic test\" in which an actual target missile was launched, but the entire interceptor system was tested electronically, albeit no actual interceptor was launched. This test was successful in its entirety. The AAD Missile was tested on December 2007 which successfully intercepted a modified Prithvi missile simulating the [[M9 Anti-tank Rocket Launcher|M-9]] and [[M-11 Shtorm|M-11]] class of ballistic missiles. Interception happened at an altitude of {{convert|15|km|0|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hindu.com/2007/12/07/stories/2007120750160100.htm|title=Interceptor missile test-fired|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080107212831/http://www.hindu.com/2007/12/07/stories/2007120750160100.htm|archivedate=7 January 2008|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===== Anti-satellite weapon =====\n{{main|2019 Indian anti-satellite missile test}}\nAfter testing the over 5,000&nbsp;km Agni V missile, which went up to 600&nbsp;km into space during its [[parabolic trajectory]], the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) now feels it can fashion deadly anti-satellite (ASAT) weapons in double-quick time.

A separate Department of Defence Research and Development was formed in 1980 which later on administered DRDO and its 50 laboratories/establishments. Most of the time the Defence Research Development Organisation was treated as if it was a vendor and the Army Headquarters or the Air Headquarters were the customers. Because the Army and the Air Force themselves did not have any design or construction responsibility, they tended to treat the designer or Indian industry at par with their corresponding designer in the world market. If they could get a [[MiG-21]] from the world market, they wanted a MiG-21 from DRDO.<ref name=\"GS\">{{cite web |author=John Pike |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/india/drdo.htm |title=Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) |publisher=Globalsecurity.org |accessdate=31 August 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100423074603/http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/india/drdo.htm |archive-date=23 April 2010 |url-status=live }}</ref>\n\nDRDO started its first major project in [[surface-to-air missile]]s (SAM) known as [[Project Indigo]] in 1960s. Indigo was discontinued in later years without achieving full success. Project Indigo led to [[Project Devil]], along with Project Valiant, to develop short-range SAM and [[ICBM]] in the 1970s. Project Devil itself led to the later development of the [[Prithvi (missile)|Prithvi]] missile under the [[Integrated Guided Missile Development Programme]] (IGMDP) in the 1980s. IGMDP was an Indian [[Ministry of Defence (India)|Ministry of Defence]] programme between the early 1980s and 2007 for the development of a comprehensive range of missiles, including the [[Agni missile]], Prithvi ballistic missile, [[Akash missile]], [[Trishul missile]] and [[Nag Missile]]. In 2010, defence minister [[A. K. Antony]] ordered the restructuring of the DRDO to give 'a major boost to defence research in the country and to ensure effective participation of the private sector in defence technology'. The key measures to make DRDO effective in its functioning include the establishment of a Defence Technology Commission with the defence minister as its chairman.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.defencetalk.com/mod-announces-major-drdo-restructuring-plan-26384/ |title=MoD Announces Major DRDO Restructuring Plan &#124; Defence & Security News at DefenceTalk |publisher=Defencetalk.com |date=17 May 2010 |access-date=31 August 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101129020637/http://www.defencetalk.com/mod-announces-major-drdo-restructuring-plan-26384/ |archivedate=29 November 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.defpro.com/news/details/15208/ |title=defence.professionals |publisher=defpro.com |accessdate=31 August 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110515212759/http://www.defpro.com/news/details/15208/ |archivedate=15 May 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The programmes which were largely managed by DRDO have seen considerable success with many of the systems seeing rapid deployment as well as yielding significant technological benefits.

DRDO has assisted [[Hindustan Aeronautics Limited]] and the IAF with the indigenisation of spares and assemblies for several aircraft. DRDO laboratories have worked in coordination with academic institutes, the CSIR and even [[ISRO]] over projects required for the [[Indian Air Force]] and its sister services. DRDO's infrastructure is also utilised by other research organisations in India. In the first ever initiative of its kind, DRDO has provided its patented Copper-Titanium (CuTi) alloy technology for commercial exploitation to a start-up company. The agreement between DRDO and Pahwa Metal Tech Pvt Ltd was signed on the sidelines of the Start Up India event at Delhi.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/business/companies/drdos-patent-technology-now-with-pune-start-up-firm/|website=The Indian Express|title=DRDO's Patent Technology Now With Pune Start-Up Firm|accessdate=26 January 2016|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160125154224/http://indianexpress.com/article/business/companies/drdos-patent-technology-now-with-pune-start-up-firm/|archivedate=25 January 2016|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\nhttps://governmentfreejob.com/2020/04/drdo-mts-admit-card-2020/\n\n===Armaments===\nDRDO cooperates with the state-owned [[Ordnance Factories Board]] for producing its items. These have led to issues of marginal quality control for some items, and time-consuming rectification. Whilst these are common to the introduction of most new weapons systems, the OFB has had issues with maintaining the requisite schedule and quality of manufacture owing to their own structural problems and lack of modernization. The DRDO has played a vital role in the development of this ability since the role of private organisations in the development of small arms and similar items has been limited. A significant point in case is the INSAS rifle which has been adopted by the Indian Army as its standard battle rifle and is in extensive service. There have been issues with rifle quality in use under extreme conditions in the heat, with the OFB stating that it will rectify these troubles with higher grade material and strengthening the unit. Prior troubles were also dealt with in a similar manner.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldaffairsboard.com/showpost.php?p=147444&postcount=53|title=Account Suspended|publisher=|access-date=2 July 2015}}</ref> In the meantime, the rifle has found favour throughout the army and has been ordered in number by other paramilitary units and police forces.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldaffairsboard.com/showpost.php?p=121272&postcount=26|title=Account Suspended|publisher=|access-date=2 July 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.worldaffairsboard.com/showpost.php?p=147906&postcount=55|title=Account Suspended|publisher=|accessdate=2 July 2015}}</ref>\n\nIn recent years, India's booming economy has allowed the OFB to modernise with more state funding coming its way, to the tune of {{USD}}400 million invested during 2002\u201307.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.flonnet.com/fl2006/stories/20030328002409400.htm |title=Modernisation is a continuous process in OFB |publisher=Flonnet.com |access-date=31 August 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100731032705/http://www.flonnet.com/fl2006/stories/20030328002409400.htm |archivedate=31 July 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The organization hopes that this will allow it to modernize its infrastructure; it has also begun introducing new items, including a variant of the AK-47 rifles.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.acig.org/artman/publish/article_420.shtml |title=DEFEXPO 2004 - Part 5 |publisher=Acig.org |access-date=31 August 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100930003031/http://www.acig.org/artman/publish/article_420.shtml |archivedate=30 September 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe DRDO's various projects are:\n\n====Small arms====\n\n* The [[INSAS rifle|INSAS]] weapon system has become the standard battle rifle for the Indian Army and paramilitary units.

This system saw the DRDO cooperate extensively with the privately owned industrial sector in India. As of 2016, the Pinaka Mk1 system, with rockets of up to 40&nbsp;km striking distance, has been successfully inducted in the Indian Army, with two regiments in service and two more on order. The Pinaka Mk2 program with rockets of up to 60&nbsp;km in range, has cleared trials and has been recommended for induction as well.\n* A new long-range tactical rocket system, referred to as the Prahaar (with the name meaning \"Strike\", in Hindi) program, while an exportable derivative was named as the Pragati (\"Progress\" in Hindi) and displayed in a South Korean arms fair.

The aim is to develop a long-range system able to strike at a range of 100\u2013120&nbsp;km, with each rocket in the system, having a payload of up to 250&nbsp;kg. The new MBRS's rocket will have a maximum speed of 4.7 mach and will rise to an altitude of 40&nbsp;km, before hitting its target at 1.8 mach. There is also a move to put a sophisticated new inertial guidance system on the rockets whilst keeping cost constraints in mind. The DRDO has evaluated the IMI-Elisra developed trajectory control system and its technology, for use with the Pinaka, and a further development of the system could presumably be used with the new MBRL as well.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/2005/09/18/stories/2005091800620500.htm |title=Defence scientists plan artillery rockets with 100-km range |publisher=Hindu Business Line |date=18 September 2005 |access-date=31 August 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100731023204/http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/2005/09/18/stories/2005091800620500.htm |archivedate=31 July 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n* DRDO's ARDE developed 81&nbsp;mm and the,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ofbindia.gov.in/products/data/ammunition/mb/11.htm |title=Ordnance Factory Board |publisher=Ofbindia.gov.in |accessdate=31 August 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100730125943/http://ofbindia.gov.in/products/data/ammunition/mb/11.htm |archivedate=30 July 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> 120&nbsp;mm illuminating bombs<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ofbindia.gov.in/products/data/ammunition/mb/14.htm |title=Ordnance Factory Board |publisher=Ofbindia.gov.in |access-date=31 August 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100930004941/http://ofbindia.gov.in/products/data/ammunition/mb/14.htm |archivedate=30 September 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> and 105&nbsp;mm illuminating shells<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ofbindia.gov.in/products/data/ammunition/lc/9.htm |title=Ordnance Factory Board |publisher=Ofbindia.gov.in |access-date=31 August 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100730125246/http://ofbindia.gov.in/products/data/ammunition/lc/9.htm |archivedate=30 July 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> for the [[Indian Army]]'s infantry and Artillery.\n* A 51&nbsp;mm Lightweight Infantry Platoon Mortar for the Indian Army.

Divya Drishti will field a range of static as well as mobile ESM stations that can \"fingerprint\"  and track multiple airborne targets for mission analysis purposes. The system will be able to intercept a range of radio frequency emissions like radar, navigational, communication or electronic countermeasure signals. The various components of the project will be networked via [[Communications satellite|SATCOM]] links.\n* Additional DRDO EW projects delivered to the Indian Air Force have included the COIN A and COIN B SIGINT stations. DRDO and BEL developed ELINT equipment for the Indian Air Force, installed on the service's Boeing 737s and Hawker Siddeley Avro aircraft. DRDO has also developed a Radar Fingerprinting System for the IAF and the Navy.\n* Another high accuracy ESM system is being developed by the DRDO for the [[DRDO AEW&CS|AEW&C]] project. The Indian Air Force's AEW&C systems will also include a comprehensive ESM suite, capable of picking up both radars as well as conducting [[COMINT|Communications Intelligence]].\n\n====Radars====\n\nThe DRDO has steadily increased its radar development. The result has been substantial progress in India's ability to design and manufacture high power radar systems with locally sourced components and systems. This began with the development of short-range 2D systems (Indra-1) and has now extended to high power 3D systems like LRTR intended for strategic purposes. Several other projects span the gamut of radar applications, from airborne surveillance ([[Airborne early warning and control|AEW&C]]) to firecontrol radars (land based and airborne).

This was the first high power radar developed by the DRDO, with the Indra-I radar for the Indian Army, followed by Indra Pulse Compression (PC) version for the Indian Air Force, also known as the Indra-II, which is a low level radar to search and track low flying cruise missiles, helicopters and aircraft. These are 2D radars that provide range and azimuth information and are meant to be used as gap fillers. The Indra 2 PC has pulse compression providing improved range resolution. The series is used both by the [[Indian Air Force]] and the [[Indian Army]]\n*[[File:Rajendra Radar.jpg|thumb|[[Rajendra Radar|Rajendra fire control radar]] at Adamya Chaitanya Exhibition 2016]][[Rajendra Radar|Rajendra fire control radar]] for the [[Akash missile|Akash SAM]]: The Rajendra is stated to be ready. However, it can be expected that further iterative improvements will be made. The Rajendra is a high power [[Passive electronically scanned array]] radar (PESA), with the ability able to guide up to 12 Akash SAMs against aircraft flying at low to medium altitudes. The Rajendra has a detection range of 80&nbsp; km with 18&nbsp; km height coverage against small fighter-sized targets and is able to track 64 targets, engaging 4 simultaneously, with up to 3 missiles per target. The Rajendra features a fully digital high-speed signal processing system with an adaptive moving target indicator, coherent signal processing, FFTs, and variable pulse repetition frequency. The entire PESA antenna array can swivel 360 degrees on a rotating platform. This allows the radar antenna to be rapidly repositioned and even conduct all-round surveillance.\n* [[Central Acquisition Radar (3D-CAR)|Central Acquisition Radar]], a state of the art planar array S-band radar operating on the stacked beam principle. With a range of 180&nbsp;km, it can [[track while scan]] 200 fighter-sized targets. Its systems are integrated on high mobility, locally built TATRA trucks for the Army and Air Force; however, it is meant to be used by all three services. Initially developed for the long-running Akash SAM system, seven were ordered by the Indian Air Force for their radar modernization program and two of another variants were ordered by the Indian Navy for their P-28 Corvettes. The CAR has been a significant success for radar development in India, with its state of the art signal processing hardware.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.acig.org/artman/uploads/os_car_001.jpg |title=JPEG image of the 3D CAR, image copyright Acig.org |accessdate=31 August 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606225833/http://www.acig.org/artman/uploads/os_car_001.jpg |archivedate=6 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/PoliticsNation/IAF_going_through_stage_of_modernisation_Major/articleshow/3705906.cms |title=IAF modernisation |publisher=Economictimes.indiatimes.com |date=12 November 2008 |accessdate=31 August 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090111125239/http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/PoliticsNation/IAF_going_through_stage_of_modernisation_Major/articleshow/3705906.cms |archivedate=11 January 2009 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> The ROHINI is the IAF specific variant while the REVATHI is the Indian Navy specific variant. The ROHINI has a more advanced Indian developed antenna in terms of power handling and beamforming technology while the REVATHI adds two-axis stabilization for operation in naval conditions, as well as extra naval modes.[[File: BFSR-SR with thermal imager.JPG|thumb|[[BEL Battle Field Surveillance Radar|Battlefield Surveillance Radar]]-Short Range (BFSR-SR) on display at Aero India-2007.|alt=]]\n* [[BEL Battle Field Surveillance Radar|BFSR-SR]], a 2D short-range Battle Field Surveillance Radar, meant to be man-portable. Designed and developed by LRDE, the project was a systematic example of concurrent engineering, with the production agency involved through the design and development stage.

Up to 10 BFSR-SR can be networked together for network-centric operation. It is in use with the [[Indian Army]] and the [[Border Security Force|BSF]] as well as export customers.\n* Super Vision-2000, an airborne 3D naval surveillance radar, meant for helicopters and light transport aircraft. This program was subsequently superseded by the advanced XV-2004 which offered a more sophisticated architecture able to handle SAR and ISAR modes. The SV-2000 is a lightweight, high performance, slotted array radar operating in the X-Band. It can detect sea-surface targets such as a periscope or a vessel against heavy clutter and can also be used for navigation, weather mapping, and beacon detection. The radar can detect a large vessel at over 100 nautical miles (370&nbsp; km). It is currently under modification to be fitted to the Advanced Light Helicopter and the Navy's Do-228's. Variants can be fitted to the Navy's Ka-25's as well. A more advanced variant of the Super Vision, known as the XV-2004 is now in trials and features an ISAR, SAR Capability intended for the Indian Navy's helicopter fleet.\n* [[Swordfish Long Range Tracking Radar]], a 3D AESA was developed with assistance from [[Elta]] of [[Israel]] and is similar to Elta's proven GreenPine long-range Active Array radar. The DRDO developed the signal processing and software for tracking high-speed ballistic missile targets as well as introduced more ruggedization. The radar uses mostly Indian designed and manufactured components such as its critical high power, L Band Transmit-Receive modules and other enabling technologies necessary for active phased array radars. The LRTR can track 200 targets and has a range of above 500&nbsp; km. It can detect [[Intermediate-range ballistic missile]]. The LRTR would be amongst the key elements of the [[Indian Ballistic Missile Defence Programme]]. DRDO would provide the technology to private and public manufacturers to make these high power systems.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.hindu.com/2005/04/15/stories/2005041509810400.htm |title=Details of LRTR from 2004 |publisher=Hindu.com |date=15 April 2005 |accessdate=31 August 2010 |location=Chennai, India |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100809122055/http://www.hindu.com/2005/04/15/stories/2005041509810400.htm |archivedate=9 August 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n* 3D Multi-Function Control Radar (MFCR) was developed as part of the Indian anti-ballistic missile program in cooperation with [[Thales Group|THALES]] of France. The MFCR is an active phased array radar and complements the ''Swordfish Long Range Tracking Radar'', for intercepting ballistic missiles. The MFCR will also serve as the fire control radar for the AAD second-tier missile system of the ABM program. The AAD has a supplementary role against aircraft as well and can engage missiles and aircraft up to an altitude of 30&nbsp; km. The MFCR fills out the final part of the DRDO's radar development spectrum and allows India to manufacture long-range 3D radars that can act as the nodes of an Air Defence Ground Environment system.\n* 2D Low-Level Lightweight Radar (LLLWR) for the Indian Army, known as the Bharani, which requires many of these units for gap-filling in mountainous terrain and has been ordered into production after clearing Indian Army trials. The Indian Air Force will also acquire a more advanced unit, called the Aslesha. The LLLWR is a 2D radar with a range of 40&nbsp; km against a 2 square meter target, intended as a gap-filler to plug detection gaps versus low-level aircraft in an integrated Air Defence Ground network. The LLLWR makes use of Indra-2 technology, namely a similar antenna array, but has roughly half the range and is much smaller and a far more portable unit. The LLLWR can [[track while scan]] 100 targets and provide details about their speed, azimuth, and range to the operator. The LLLWR makes use of the BFSR-SR experience and many of the subsystem providers are the same. Multiple LLLWRs can be networked together. The LLLWR is meant to detect low-level intruders, and will alert Army Air Defence fire control units to cue their weapon systems.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://media.bharat-rakshak.com/aero/main.php?g2_itemId=1355 |title=LLLR Specifications |publisher=Media.bharat-rakshak.com |date=18 January 2007 |accessdate=31 August 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071021103105/http://media.bharat-rakshak.com/aero/main.php?g2_itemId=1355 |archivedate=21 October 2007 |df=dmy }}</ref>\n* 3D Short-Range Radar for the Indian Air Force \u2013 ASLESHA: The ASLESHA radars have a range of approximately 50&nbsp; km against small fighter-sized targets and will be able to determine their range, speed, azimuth, and height. This radar will enable the Indian Air Force Air Defence units to accurately track low-level intruders. The radar is a semi-active phased array with a 1-meter square aperture. The DRDO was in discussions with the Indian Navy to mount these systems on small ships.\n* Multi-mode radar, a 3D radar is a HAL project with DRDO's LRDE as a subsystem provider. This project to develop an advanced, lightweight Multi-mode fire control radar for the [[LCA Tejas]] fighter had faced challenges and was delayed and finally superseded by a program called the Uttam to develop an AESA FCR for the Tejas LCA. The MMR program was finally completed with Elta's (Israel) assistance and became a hybrid system incorporating the original DRDO antenna, gimbal stabilization, and Israeli backend. The multi-mode radar has the range (for detection of a small fighter target) around 100&nbsp; km can track 10 targets, can engage 2 targets and uses the lightweight system. Originally, DRDO developed an all-new combined signal and the data processor had been developed, replacing the original separate units. The new unit is much more powerful and makes use of contemporary ADSP processors. The radar's critical hardware was also developed and validated. The software for the air-to-air mode has been developed considerably (including search and track while scan in both look up and look down modes) but air-to-ground modes were still being worked upon and proved problematic. The radar development was shown to be considerably more mature than previously thought but still faced significant delays and challenges. At Aero India 2009, it was revealed that the 3D MMR project has been superseded by the new 3D AESA FCR project led by LRDE. The MMR has been completed with Elta Israel's assistance and now involved [[Elta]] [[EL/M-2032]] technology for Air-to-Ground mapping and targeting \u2013 in order to simplify testing, the Hybrid MMR basically became an Indian variant of the EL/M-2032 with an Indian antenna and gimbal system as Elta pointed out mixing and matching Indian hardware with Israeli software would, in essence, mean a new design with a significant time impact. The \"hybrid\" MMR has been tested, validated and will be supplied for the initial [[LCA Tejas]] fighters.\n* DRDO has indigenized components and improved subsystems of various other license-produced radars manufactured at [[Bharat Electronics Limited|BEL]] with the help of BEL scientists and other researchers. These improvements include new radar data processors for license-produced signal radars as well as local radar assemblies replacing the earlier imported ones.\n* [[BEL Weapon Locating Radar]]:[[File:Weapon Locating Radar (Swathi) passes through the Rajpath, on the occasion of the 69th Republic Day Parade 2018, in New Delhi on January 26, 2018.jpg|thumb|BEL Weapon Locating Radar (Swathi) passes on the occasion of the 69th Republic Day Parade 2018.]]Swati, a 3D radar developed from the Rajendra fire-control radar for the Akash system, uses a [[passive electronically scanned array]] to detect multiple targets for fire correction and weapon location.

The Indian Army has ordered 28 of these units. \n* 3D Tactical Control Radar: a new program, the TCR is an approximately 90&nbsp; km ranged system for use by the Indian Army. A highly mobile unit, it is a variant of the 3D CAR unit and packaged into 2 as verses 3 units. The Indian Army has ordered many of the types for its Air Defense Units.\n\nApart from the above, the DRDO has also several other radar systems currently under development or in trials, these include:\n\n* Active Phased Array radar: a 3D radar for fighters, an MMR follow on, the APAR project aims to field a fully-fledged operational AESA fire control radar for the expected Mark-2 version of the [[Light Combat Aircraft]]. This will be the second airborne AESA program after the AEW&C project and intends to replicate DRDO's success with the ground-based radar segment to airborne systems. The overall airborne APAR program aims to prevent this technology gap from developing, with a broad-based program to bring DRDO up to par with international developers in airborne systems, both fire control, and surveillance. As of 2016, the radar was still in development, with variants expected to be fielded on future IAF fighters like the MCA or Tejas advanced Marks.\n* [[Synthetic aperture radar]] & [[Inverse synthetic aperture radar]]: the DRDO's LRDE is currently working on both SAR and ISAR radars for target detection and classification. These lightweight payloads are intended for both conventional fixed wing as well as [[Unmanned Aerial Vehicle|UAV]] applications.\n* Airborne Warning and Control: a new radar-based on [[active electronically scanned array]] technology. The aim of the project is to develop an in-house capability for high power AEW&C systems, with the system covering the development of an S-Band AESA array. The aircraft will also have data-links to link fighters plus communicate with the IAF's C3I infrastructure as well as a local SATCOM (satellite communication system), along with other onboard ESM and COMINT systems.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.blonnet.com/2006/01/25/stories/2006012501641500.htm |title=Aircraft for AWACS to be chosen by the IAF |publisher=Blonnet.com |date=25 January 2006 |accessdate=31 August 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100813033613/http://www.blonnet.com/2006/01/25/stories/2006012501641500.htm |archivedate=13 August 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> As of 2016, the system was in advanced trials and had achieved a TRL (Technical Readiness Level) of 8/10 with trials focusing on proving its self-protection equipment.\n* Medium-Range Battlefield Surveillance Radar: in 2009, the LRDE (DRDO) noted that it was working on a ''Long-range'' battlefield surveillance radar. It is possible that the BFSR-LR project has replaced this earlier project and the [[Indian Army]] will utilize the BEL built [[ELTA]] designed BFSR-MR's for Medium-Range surveillance while using the LRDE designed systems for Long Range surveillance. The 2D radar was to track ground targets and provide key intelligence to the Indian Army's artillery units, with the resultant information available on various tactical networks. As of 2016, this project was not active.\n* 3D Medium Power Radar: a spin-off of the experience gained via the 3D MFCR project, the 3D Medium Power Radar project is intended to field a radar with a range of approximately 300&nbsp; km against small fighter-sized targets. Intended for the Indian Air Force, the radar is an active phased array, and will be transportable. It will play a significant role being used as part of the nodes of the [[Indian Air Force]]'s enhanced Air Defence Ground Environment System. As of 2016, the radar was ready for IAF user trials and the IAF had ordered 8 MPRs already.\n* 3D Low-Level Transportable Radar: A new program, the LLTR is also called the Ashwini and is an approximately 200\u2013150&nbsp; km ranged system for use by the Indian  Air Force. A highly mobile unit, it will also employ AESA technology, and [[open architecture]] to provide easy upgrades and a variety of modes and capabilities depending on the software fit. The aim of the 3D Medium Power Radar and LLTR is to offer systems that can be deployed in a variety of roles, from fire control to surveillance, and not be tied to one role alone. As of 2016, the LLTR program was in an advanced stage and expected to reach the trials phase\n* 3D Army AD Fire Control Radar: A new program for the Indian Army, the Atulya FCR is intended to provide Army AD units with a compact fire control system for their armament. The Indian Army has a total requirement of over 60 FCRs.\n* 3D Army Multi-Mission Radar: A new program for the Indian Army, the mobile compact radar system is expected to be capable of both artillery detection and air defense missions. As of 2016, it was in an advanced stage of development, with basic design completed and realization of the prototype underway.\n\n====Command and control software and decision-making tools====\n* Tactical tools for wargaming: Shatranj and Sangram for the Army, Sagar for the Navy and air war software for the Air Force. All these systems are operational with the respective services.\n* C3I systems: DRDO, in cooperation with BEL and private industry has developed several critical C3I (command, control, communications and intelligence systems) for the armed services. Under the project \"Shakti\", the Indian Army aims to spend {{USD}}300 million to network all its artillery guns using the ACCS (Artillery Command and Control System). Developed by DRDO's Centre for Artificial Intelligence & Robotics, the system comprises computers and intelligent terminals connected as a wide area network. Its main subsystems are the artillery computer centre, battery computer, remote access terminal and a gun display unit. The ACCS is expected to improve the Army's artillery operations by a factor of 10 and allowing for more rapid and accurate firepower. The ACCS will also improve the ability of commanders to concentrate that fire-power where it is most needed. The DRDO and BEL have also developed a Battle Management system for the [[Indian Army]] for its tanks and tactical units.\n\nOther programmes in development for the Army include Corps level information and decision making software and tools, intended to link all units together for effective C3I. These systems are in production at DRDO's production partner, [[Bharat Electronics]]. These projects are being driven by the [[Indian Army Corps of Signals]]. The Indian Army is also moving towards extensive use of battlefield computers. DRDO has also delivered projects such as the Combat Net Radio for enhancing the Army's communication hardware.\n* Data management and command and control systems for the Navy have been provided by the DRDO. The Navy is currently engaged in a naval networking project to network all its ships and shore establishments plus maritime patrol aircraft and sensors.\n* Radar netting and multi-sensor fusion software for linking the Indian Air Force's network of radars and airbases which have been operationalised. Other systems include sophisticated and highly complex ''mission planning and C3I systems'' for missiles, such as the Agni and Prithvi ballistic missiles and the Brahmos cruise missile. These systems are common to all three services as all of them utilise different variants of these missiles.\n* Simulators and training tools: DRDO and private industry have collaborated on manufacturing a range of simulators and training devices for the three services, from entry level tests for prospective entrants to the Indian Air Force, to sophisticated simulators for fighter aircraft, transports and helicopters, tanks and gunnery devices.\n\n====Computing technologies====\n\nDRDO has worked extensively on high speed computing given its ramifications for most of its defence projects. These include supercomputers for computational flow dynamics, to dedicated microprocessor designs manufactured in India for flight controllers and the like, to high speed computing boards built around Commercial Off The Shelf (COTS) components, similar to the latest trends in the defence industry.\n* Supercomputing: DRDO's ANURAG developed the PACE+<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.hpcwire.com/archives/5465.html |title=Report from 1995 on the initial PACE system |publisher=Hpcwire.com |date=4 May 1995 |accessdate=31 August 2010 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100809225656/http://www.hpcwire.com/archives/5465.html |archivedate=9 August 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> Supercomputer for strategic purposes for supporting its various programmes. The initial version, as detailed in 1995, had the following specifications: The system delivered a sustained performance of more than 960 Mflops (million floating operations per second) for computational [[fluid dynamics]] programmes. Pace-Plus included 32 advanced computing nodes, each with 64 megabytes(MB) of memory that can be expanded up to 256MB and a powerful front-end processor which is a [[hyperSPARC]] with a speed of 66/90/100 megahertz (MHz). Besides fluid dynamics, these high-speed computer systems were used in areas such as vision, medical imaging, signal processing, molecular modeling, neural networks and finite element analysis. The latest variant of the PACE series is the PACE ++, a 128 node parallel processing system. With a front-end processor, it has a distributed memory and message passing system. Under Project '''Chitra''', the DRDO is implementing a system with a computational speed of 2-3 Teraflops utilising commercial off the shelf components and the Open Source Linux Operating System.\n* Processors and other critical items: DRDO has developed a range of processors and application specific integrated circuits for its critical projects. Many of these systems are modular, in the sense that they can be reused across different projects. These include \"Pythagoras processor\" to convert cartesian to polar coordinates, ANUCO, a floating point coprocessor and several others, including the ANUPAMA 32-bit processor, which is being used in several DRDO projects.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.electronicsforu.com/electronicsforu/articles/hits.asp?id=1106 |title=ANUPAMA processor |publisher=Electronicsforu.com |accessdate=31 August 2010}}</ref>\n* Electronic components: one of the endeavours undertaken by the DRDO has been to create a substantial local design and development capability within India, both in the private and public sectors. This policy has led to several hard to obtain or otherwise denied items, being designed and manufactured in India. These include components such as radar subsystems (product specific travelling wave tubes) to components necessary for electronic warfare and other cutting edge projects. Today, there are a range of firms across India, which design and manufacture key components for DRDO, allowing it to source locally for quite a substantial chunk of its procurement. The DRDO has also endeavoured to use COTS (Commercial off the shelf) processors and technology, and follow Open Architecture standards, wherever possible, in order to pre-empt obsolescence issues and follow industry practise. One significant example is the development of an Open Architecture computer for the Light Combat Aircraft, based on the PowerPC architecture and VME64 standard. Variants of the earlier Mission computer utilising Intel 486 DX chips are already present on the Su-30 MKI, Jaguar and MiG-27 Upgrades for the Indian Air Force.\n\n====Laser Science & Technology Centre (LASTEC)====\nDRDO is working on a slew of directed energy weapons (DEWs). LASTEC has identified DEWs, along with space security, cyber-security and hypersonic vehicles as focus areas in the next 15 years.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/DRDOs-next-Star-Wars-like-weapons/articleshow/6248942.cms#ixzz3qGVfeigT|title=DRDO's next: Star Wars-like weapons|publisher=The Times of India|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151020161307/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/DRDOs-next-Star-Wars-like-weapons/articleshow/6248942.cms#ixzz3qGVfeigT|archivedate=20 October 2015|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The aim is to develop laser-based weapons, deployed on airborne as well as seaborne platforms, which can intercept missiles soon after they are launched towards India in the boost phase itself. These will be part of the ballistic missile defence system being currently developed by DRDO. LASTEC is developing a 25-kilowatt laser system to hit a missile during its terminal phase at a distance of 5\u20137&nbsp;km. LASTEC is also working on a vehicle-mounted gas dynamic laser-based DEW system, under project Aditya, which should be ready in three years. Project Aditya is a technology demonstrator to prove beam control technology. Ultimately, solid-state lasers would be used.

Local systems include the DRDO-developed [[Reactive armour|ERA]], a DRDO-developed laser warning system and combat net radio, the Bharat Electronics Limited advanced land navigation system consisting of fibre optic gyros and GPS, [[Weapon of mass destruction|NBC]] protection and DRDO's fire detection and suppression system amongst other items. Imported systems include a compact [[Thermographic camera|thermal imager]] and fire control system and a new 1000&nbsp;hp engine.\n* Anti-tank ammunition: DRDO developed the [[Kinetic energy penetrator|FSAPDS]] for the 125&nbsp;mm calibre, meant for India's T-72 tanks, the 120&nbsp;mm [[Kinetic energy penetrator|FSAPDS]] and [[High explosive squash head|HESH]] rounds for the [[Arjun MBT|Arjun tank]] and 105&nbsp;mm [[Kinetic energy penetrator|FSAPDS]] rounds for the Army's [[Vijayanta]] and [[T-55]] tanks. Significant amounts of 125&nbsp;mm anti-tank rounds manufactured by the Ordnance Factory Board were rejected. The problems were traced to improper packaging of the charges by the OFB, leading to propellant leakage during storage at high temperatures. The locally developed rounds were rectified and requalified. Production of these local rounds was then restarted. Since 2001, over {{formatnum:130000}} rounds have been manufactured by the OFB. The DRDO said in 2005 that it had developed a Mk2 version of the 125&nbsp;mm round, with higher power propellant for greater penetration. In parallel, the OFB announced in 2006 that it was also manufacturing 125&nbsp;mm IMI ([[Israel Military Industries]]) rounds. It is believed that this might assist in improving the OFB's APFSDS manufacturing capability. These rounds and presumably the Mk2 round and will be used by both the [[T-72]] and [[T-90]] formations in the [[Indian Army]].<ref>{{cite web |author=Press Trust of India / New Delhi&nbsp;3 October 2005 |url=http://www.business-standard.com/bsonline/storypage.php?autono=219530 |title=OFB manufacturing new 125 mm round from IMI |publisher=Business-standard.com |date=3 October 2005 |access-date=31 August 2010 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100729034307/http://www.business-standard.com/bsonline/storypage.php?autono=219530 |archivedate=29 July 2010 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>[http://mod.nic.in/reports/MOD-English2006.pdf MOD Annual Report from 2006 with details on new DRDO projects delivered, including new 125 mm MK2 FSAPDS] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927013233/http://mod.nic.in/reports/MOD-English2006.pdf |date=27 September 2007 }} [PDF File]</ref>\n* Various armour technologies and associated subsystems from [[composite armour]] and [[explosive reactive armour]] to ''Radios'' (Combat Net Radio with frequency hopping and encryption) and Battle Management systems.

The Army will deploy the Nag on ground-based launchers and from helicopters, whereas the Air Force will rely on helicopter based units. The Nag has an Imaging Infrared (IIR) seeker and has a top and direct attack capability, with a tandem warhead. The Army's land missile carrier and launcher, known as the Namica, carries several ready to use Nag missiles within and four Nag missiles in an extendable launcher above the turret. The Namica has its own FLIR based sighting and fire control unit.\n\n[[File:Nag with NAMICA Defexpo-2008.JPG|thumb|[[Nag missile]]]]\n\nThe Air Force and Army will also use their Advanced Light helicopters (ALH) ([[HAL Dhruv]]) and the [[HAL Light Combat Helicopter]] (LHC) as Nag carriers. The ALHs will be equipped with IRDE (DRDO) developed HELITIS (Heliborne Imaging and Targeting systems) with a combination of a FLIR and laser range finder in a stabilised turret for target acquisition and designation. The thermal imager is likely to be imported, but the gimballed turret, stabilisation, laser range finder and associated electronics have been designed in India and will be manufactured locally. The Nag ATGM is regarded as a highly capable missile, even though its development has been protracted, mainly due to the technological challenges of developing a state of the art IIR sensor equipped top attack missile. The Nag is still cheaper than most imported missiles in its category and is earmarked for the Army and Air Force.\n\nThe Nag anti-tank guided missile was cleared for production in July 2009 and there are uncorroborated reports since that it may be purchased by [[Tanzania]], [[Botswana]] and [[Morocco]].<ref name=\"export\">{{cite news|title=India seeks to boost military exports to Gulf|url=http://www.siliconindia.com/shownews/India_seeks_to_boost_military_exports_to_Gulf___-nid-18916.html|author=IANS|publisher=SiliconIndia.com|authorlink=Indo-Asian News Service|date=20 March 2003|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511105844/http://www.siliconindia.com/shownews/India_seeks_to_boost_military_exports_to_Gulf___-nid-18916.html|archivedate=11 May 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref> The Nag will complement the existing Russian [[9M113 Konkurs|9M113 Konkurs Anti-tank guided missile]] and European missile [[MILAN]] in Indian usage, both of which are manufactured under licence by Bharat Dynamics Limited.\n\n====Brahmos====\n{{main|BrahMos}}\n\nLaunched as a joint venture between India's DRDO and the Russian NPO, the BrahMos programme aims at creating a range of missile systems derived from the [[Yakhont]] missile system.

Similar to the BrahMos, Shaurya is stored in composite canisters, which makes it much easier to store for long periods without maintenance as well as to handle and transport. It also houses the gas generator to eject the missile from the canister before its solid propellant motors take over to hurl it at the intended target.\n\nShaurya missiles can remain hidden or camouflaged in underground silos from enemy surveillance or satellites till they are fired from the special storage-cum-launch canisters. The Shaurya system will require some more tests before it becomes fully operational in two to three years. Moreover, defence scientists say the high-speed, two-stage Shaurya has high maneuverability which also makes it less vulnerable to existing anti-missile defence systems.\n\nIt can be easily transported by road. The missile, encased in a canister, is mounted on a single vehicle, which has only a driver's cabin, and the vehicle itself is the launch platform. This \"single vehicle solution\" reduces its signature \u2013 it cannot be easily detected by satellites \u2013 and makes its deployment easy. The gas generator, located at the bottom of the canister produces high pressure gas, which expands and ejects the missile from the tube.\n\nThe centrepiece of a host of new technologies incorporated in Shaurya is its [[ring laser gyroscope]] (RLG) and [[accelerometer]]. The indigenous ring laser gyroscope, a sophisticated navigation and guidance system developed by the Research Centre Imarat (RCI) based in Hyderabad is a highly classified technology.\n\nIn test flights the RLG functioned exceptionally well. the RLG monitors the missile's position in space when it is flying. The missile's on-board computer will use this information and compare it with the desired position. Based on the difference between the missile's actual and desired positions, the computer will decide the optimum path and the actuators will command the missile to fly in its desired/targeted position.\nThe third test of the RLG was successful on 24 September 2011, reaching a speed of 7.5 mach. It is now ready for production.\n\n====Sagarika====\n{{main|Sagarika (missile)}}\n\nThe K-15 Sagarika is a nuclear-capable submarine-launched ballistic missile belonging to the [[K Missile family]] with a range of 750 kilometres (466&nbsp;mi). Sagarika can carry a payload of up to 500 kilograms (1,102&nbsp;lb). Sagarika was developed at the DRDO's missile complex in Hyderabad.\n\nThis missile will form part of the triad in India's nuclear deterrence, and will provide retaliatory nuclear strike capability. The development of this missile (under the title Project K-15) started in 1991. The Indian government first confirmed Sagarika's development seven years later (1998), when the then Defence Minister, George Fernandes, announced it during a press conference.\n\nThe development of the underwater missile launcher, known as Project 420 (P420), was completed in 2001 and handed over to the Indian Navy for trials. The missile was successfully test-fired six times, and tested to its full range up to three times. The test of missile from a submerged pontoon was conducted in February 2008.\n\nSagarika is being integrated with India's nuclear-powered [[Arihant class submarine]]s that began sea trials on 26 July 2009.\n\n====Prahaar====\n{{Main|Prahaar (missile)}}\n\nPrahaar is a solid-fueled surface-to-surface guided short-range tactical ballistic missile developed by DRDO of India.

While DRDO had revealed some details about the project over the years, its progress had been marked by strict secrecy, and the project itself was unlisted, and not visible among DRDO's other programmes. The ABM project has benefited from all the incremental improvements achieved by the DRDO and its associated industrial partners via the long-running and often contentious [[Akash missile]] and [[Trishul (missile)|Trishul]] missile programmes. However, it is a completely new programme, with much larger scope and with predominantly new subsystems.\n\nThe ABM project has two missiles\u2014namely the AAD (Advanced Air Defence) and PAD (Prithvi Air Defence) missiles. The former is an endo-atmospheric interceptor of new design, which can intercept targets to a height of {{convert|30|km|0|abbr=on}}. Whereas the latter is a modified Prithvi missile, dubbed the Axo-atmospheric interceptor (AXO) with a dedicated second stage kill vehicle for ballistic missile interception, up to an altitude of {{convert|80|km|0|abbr=on}}. Both these missiles are cued by an active phased array Long Range Tracking Radar, similar to the Elta GreenPine but made with locally developed components, which include DRDO-developed transmit/receive modules. The ABM system also makes use of a second radar, known as the Multi-Function Control Radar which assists the LRTR in classifying the target, and can also act as the fire control radar for the AAD missile. The MFCR, like the LRTR, is an active phased array system.\n\nThe entire system was tested in November 2006, under the Prithvi Air Defence Exercise, when a prototype AXO missile intercepted another [[Prithvi missile]] at a height of {{convert|50|km|0|abbr=on}}. This test was preceded by an \"electronic test\" in which an actual target missile was launched, but the entire interceptor system was tested electronically, albeit no actual interceptor was launched. This test was successful in its entirety. The AAD Missile was tested on December 2007 which successfully intercepted a modified Prithvi missile simulating the [[M9 Anti-tank Rocket Launcher|M-9]] and [[M-11 Shtorm|M-11]] class of ballistic missiles. Interception happened at an altitude of {{convert|15|km|0|abbr=on}}.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hindu.com/2007/12/07/stories/2007120750160100.htm|title=Interceptor missile test-fired|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080107212831/http://www.hindu.com/2007/12/07/stories/2007120750160100.htm|archivedate=7 January 2008|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\n===== Anti-satellite weapon =====\n{{main|2019 Indian anti-satellite missile test}}\nAfter testing the over 5,000&nbsp;km Agni V missile, which went up to 600&nbsp;km into space during its [[parabolic trajectory]], the Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) now feels it can fashion deadly anti-satellite (ASAT) weapons in double-quick time.

Members of this alleged master race were referred to as '''''Herrenmenschen''''' (\"master humans\").\n\nThe Nazi theorist [[Alfred Rosenberg]] believed that the Nordic race was descended from [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Proto-Aryans]], who he believed had [[Prehistory|prehistorically]] dwelt on the [[North German Plain]] and ultimately originated on the lost continent of [[Atlantis]].<ref>[[Alfred Rosenberg|Rosenberg, Alfred]], ''[[The Myth of the 20th Century]]''. The term ''Atlantis'' is mentioned two times in the whole book, the term ''Atlantis-hypothesis'' is mentioned just once. Rosenberg (page 24): \"It seems to be not completely impossible, that at parts where today the waves of the Atlantic ocean murmur and icebergs move along, once a blossoming land towered in the water, on which a creative race founded a great culture and sent its children as seafarers and warriors into the world; but if this Atlantis-hypothesis proves untenable, we still have to presume a prehistoric Nordic cultural center.\" Rosenberg (page 26): \"The ridiculed hypothesis about a Nordic creative center, which we can call Atlantis \u2013 without meaning a sunken island \u2013 from where once waves of warriors migrated to all directions as first witnesses of Nordic longing for distant lands to conquer and create, today becomes probable.\" Original: \"''Es erscheint als nicht ganz ausgeschlossen, dass an Stellen, \u00fcber die heute die Wellen des Atlantischen Ozeans rauschen und riesige Eisgebirge herziehen, einst ein bl\u00fchendes Festland aus den Fluten ragte, auf dem eine sch\u00f6pferische Rasse gro\u00dfe, weitausgreifende Kultur erzeugte und ihre Kinder als Seefahrer und Krieger hinaussandte in die Welt; aber selbst wenn sich diese Atlantishypothese als nicht haltbar erweisen sollte, wird ein nordisches vorgeschichtliches Kulturzentrum angenommen werden m\u00fcssen. ... Und deshalb wird die alte verlachte Hypothese heute Wahrscheinlichkeit, dass von einem nordischen Mittelpunkt der Sch\u00f6pfung, nennen wir ihn, ohne uns auf die Annahme eines versunkenen atlantischen Erdteils festzulegen, die Atlantis, einst Kriegerschw\u00e4rme strahlenf\u00f6rmig ausgewandert sind als erste Zeugen des immer wieder sich erneut verk\u00f6rpernden nordischen Fernwehs, um zu erobern, zu gestalten.''\"</ref> The [[Nazis]] declared that the Nordics (now referred to as the [[Germanic peoples]]), or [[Aryan]]s as they sometimes called them, were superior to all other races. The Nazis believed they were entitled to expand territorially.<ref name=\"hitler1925\">[[Adolf Hitler|Hitler, Adolf]] ''[[Mein Kampf]]'' 1925</ref> This concept is known as [[Nordicism]]. The actual policy that was implemented by the Nazis resulted in the [[Aryan certificate]]. This document, which was required by law for all citizens of the Reich was the \"Lesser Aryan certificate\" (''Kleiner Ariernachweis''). This could be obtained through an ''[[Ahnenpass]]'', which required the owner to trace her or his lineage through baptism, birth certificates or certified proof thereof that all grandparents were of \"Aryan descent\".\n\nThe [[Slavs]] (along with [[Romani people|Gypsies]] and [[Jews]]) were defined as being racially inferior and non-Aryan ''[[Untermenschen]]'', and were thus considered to be a danger to the \"Aryan\" or Germanic master race.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=241}} According to the Nazi secret [[Hunger Plan]] and ''[[Generalplan Ost]]'', the Slavic population was to be removed from [[Central Europe]] through expulsion, enslavement, starvation, and extermination,{{sfn|Snyder|2010|pp=162\u2013163, 416}} except for a small percentage who were deemed to be non-Slavic descendants of Germanic settlers, and thus suitable for [[Germanisation]].<ref name = THE>\n{{cite web\n| author = Janusz Gumkowski and Kazimierz Leszczynski\n| title = Hitler's Plans for Eastern Europe\n| work =\n| publisher = Polonia Publishing House\n| url = http://www.dac.neu.edu/holocaust/Hitlers_Plans.htm\n| pages = 7\u201333, 164\u2013178\n| location = Warsaw, Poland\n| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20111106061712/http://www.dac.neu.edu/holocaust/Hitlers_Plans.htm\n| archivedate = 6 November 2011}}</ref>\n\n==Historical background==\nEarly attempts to claim a racial division between \"masters\" and \"slaves\", or the belief that a nation's ruling class is [[biology|biologically]] superior to its ruled subjects, were made in the 18th century. [[Henri de Boulainvilliers]] in his book ''History of the Ancient Government of France'' (published posthumously in 1727) tried to prove that in [[France]], the nobility represented the descendants of the old [[Franks|Frankish]] ruling class, whereas the rest of the population was descended from the subject [[Gauls]]. Therefore two qualitatively different races were confronting one another, and the only way to abolish the superiority of the Franks was to destroy their civilization.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://edisciplinas.usp.br/pluginfile.php/4179816/mod_resource/content/1/THE%20DESTRUCTION%20OF%20REASON.pdf|title=Luk\u00e1cs, Gy\u00f6rgy  (1952), ''The Destruction of Reason'', p. 668}}</ref> [[Classical liberal]] theorists such as [[Constantin Fran\u00e7ois de Chasseb\u0153uf, comte de Volney|Volney]] and [[Emmanuel Joseph Siey\u00e8s|Siey\u00e8s]] discredited this theory by showing that the French nobility consisted mostly of [[Nouveau riche|nouveaux riches]] who came from all parts of the country, and thus the idea of a racially-pure Frankish lineage was fraudulent.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://edisciplinas.usp.br/pluginfile.php/4179816/mod_resource/content/1/THE%20DESTRUCTION%20OF%20REASON.pdf|title=Luk\u00e1cs, Gy\u00f6rgy  (1952), ''The Destruction of Reason'', p. 669}}</ref>\n\nIn 1855, French count [[Arthur de Gobineau]] published his infamous work ''[[An Essay on the Inequality of the Human Races]]''. Expanding upon Boulainvilliers' use of [[ethnography]] to defend the [[Ancien R\u00e9gime]] against the claims of the [[Third Estate]], Gobineau divides the human species into three major groupings, white, yellow and black, claiming to demonstrate that \"history springs only from contact with the white races.\" Among the white races, he distinguishes the [[Aryan]] race as the pinnacle of human development, the basis of all European aristocracies. However, inevitable [[miscegenation]] led to the \"downfall of civilizations\". The politically [[legitimist]] Gobineau was an enemy of [[democracy]] as much as he was an enemy of miscegenation.\n\nGobineau's influence was slight at first. In his letters to [[Alexis de Tocqueville]], he complained that his book was being hushed up in France and was having a real effect only in the [[United States]]. Tocqueville, who rejected the book in spite of his friendship with Gobineau, pointed out to him that this was because the book chimed with the [[Slavery in the United States|slave-owners']] interests in the Southern states.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://edisciplinas.usp.br/pluginfile.php/4179816/mod_resource/content/1/THE%20DESTRUCTION%20OF%20REASON.pdf|title=Luk\u00e1cs, Gy\u00f6rgy  (1952), ''The Destruction of Reason'', p. 670-1}}</ref> However, in the 1880s the book gained popularity in [[Germany]] thanks to the efforts of [[Cosima Wagner]]. In 1899, [[Houston Stewart Chamberlain]], a [[Germanophile]] Englishman and Cosima Wagner's son-in-law, published ''[[The Foundations of the Nineteenth Century]]''. Expanding upon Gobineau's earlier theories, he argued that that [[Western civilization]] is deeply marked by the influence of the [[Teutons|Teutonic]] peoples. Chamberlain grouped all European peoples\u2014not just Germans, but [[Celts]], [[Slavs]], [[Greeks]], and [[Latins (Italic tribe)|Latins]]\u2014into the \"[[Aryan race]]\", a race built on the ancient [[Proto-Indo-European]] culture. At the helm of the Aryan race, and, indeed, all races, he saw the [[Nordic race|Nordic]] or Teutonic peoples.\n\nThe ''[[\u00dcbermensch]]'' ([[German language|German]]) (\"Overman\" or \"Superman\") is a [[concept]] in the [[Philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche|philosophy of]] [[Germans|German]] [[Philosophy|philosopher]] [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]\u2014he posited the ''\u00dcbermensch'' as a goal for humanity to set for itself in his 1883 book ''[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]'' ({{lang-de|Also Sprach Zarathustra}}). However, Nietzsche never developed the concept on racial grounds. Instead, the ''\u00dcbermensch'' \"seems to be the ideal aim of spiritual development more than a biological goal\".<ref>{{cite book|last=Solomon|first=Robert C.|authorlink=Robert C.

This reasoning was simultaneously intertwined with [[Nordicism]] which proclaimed that the \"[[Nordic race]]\" was the \"purest\" form of the said [[Aryan race]].  Today, this view is regarded as a form of [[scientific racism]] and contradicts the belief in [[racial equality]] by positing the view that one [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]] is superior to all other races.\n\n===Eugenics===\n[[Eugenics]] came to play a prominent role in this racial thought as a way to improve and maintain the [[Racial purity|purity]] of the Aryan master race.

This 19th-century concept was initially developed by Count [[Arthur de Gobineau|Joseph Arthur De Gobineau]].

It was believed at this time that the peoples of [[Southern Europe]] were racially mixed with non-European [[Moors]] from across the [[Mediterranean Sea]], while the peoples of [[Northern Europe]] and [[Western Europe]] remained pure. Proponents of the Nordic theory further argued that Nordic peoples had developed an innate toughness and determination due to the harsh, challenging climate in which they evolved.\n\nThe philosopher [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] was one of the earliest proponents of a theory presenting a hierarchical racial model of history, attributing civilisational primacy to the \"white races\" who gained their sensitivity and intelligence by refinement in the rigorous [[north]].\n\n<blockquote>The highest civilisation and culture, apart from the Ancient Indians and Egyptians, are found exclusively among the white races; and even with many dark peoples, the ruling caste or race is fairer in colour than the rest and has, therefore, evidently immigrated, for example, the Brahmins, the Incas, and the rulers of the South Sea Islands. All this is because necessity is the mother of invention because those tribes that emigrated early to the north and there gradually became white, had to develop all their intellectual powers and invent and perfect all the arts in their struggle with need, want and misery, which in their many forms were brought about by the climate. This they had to do in order to make up for the parsimony of nature and out of it all came their high civilisation.<ref>Arthur Schopenhauer, ''[[Parerga and Paralipomena]]'', Volume II, Section 92</ref></blockquote>\n\nDespite this, he was adamantly against differing treatment of races, was fervently anti-slavery, and supported the [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] movement in the United States. He describes the treatment of \"[our] innocent black brothers whom force and injustice have delivered into [the slave-master's] devilish clutches\" as \"belonging to the blackest pages of mankind's criminal record\".<ref>''Parerga and Paralipomena'', \"On Ethics,\" Sec. 5</ref>\n\n[[Hans Frank]], Hitler's personal lawyer, stated that Hitler carried a copy of Schopenhauer's book ''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'' with him wherever he went throughout [[World War I]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nobeliefs.com/hitler-myths.htm|title=Hitler Myths|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n[[File:WernerGoldberg.jpg|thumb|175px|[[Werner Goldberg]], who was part Jewish but blond and blue-eyed, was used in Nazi recruitment posters as \"The Ideal German Soldier.\"]]\nThe postulated [[Supremacism|superiority]] of these people was said to make them born leaders, or a \"master race\".{{sfn|Yenne|2010|p=88}} Other authors included [[Guido von List]], his associate [[Lanz von Liebenfels]], and the British-born German racial theorist [[Houston Stewart Chamberlain]], all of whom felt that the white race in general and [[Germanic peoples]] in particular were superior to others, and that given the [[Racial purity|purification]] of both the white race and the German people from the other races which were \"polluting\" them, a new [[Millenarianism|millenarian]] age of Aryan god-men would arrive.{{sfn|Yenne|2010|pp=22\u201325, 88}}\n\nNazi policy stressed the superiority of the Germanic ''Ubermenschen'' (superhuman) [[Nordic race]], a sub-race of the [[White people#19th and 20th century: the .22Caucasian race.22|white Caucasian race]] European population defined by [[anthropometric]] models of racial difference.

The fact that Germans were not purely Nordic was acknowledged by G\u00fcnther in his book ''[[Rassenkunde des deutschen Volkes]]'' (1922) (\"Racial Science of the German People\"), in which he described the German people as being made up of all five of his European racial categories: Nordic, Mediterranean, [[Dinaric race|Dinaric]], [[Alpine race|Alpine]], and [[East Baltic race|East Baltic]].<ref name=Maxwell150 >Anne Maxwell.

For example, [[Adolf Hitler]] and many Nazi officials had dark hair and were still considered members of the [[Aryan race]] under Nazi racial doctrine, because the determination of an individual's racial type depended on a preponderance of many characteristics in an individual rather than on just one defining feature.<ref>\"The range of blond hair color in pure Nordic peoples runs from flaxen and red to shades of chestnut and brown... It must be clearly understood that blondness of hair and of eye is not a final test of Nordic race. The Nordics include all the blonds, and also those of darker hair or eye when possessed of a preponderance of other Nordic characters. In this sense the word \"blond\" means those lighter shades of hair or eye color in contrast to the very dark or black shades which are termed brunet. The meaning of \"blond\" as now used is therefore not limited to the lighter or flaxen shades as in colloquial speech. In England among Nordic populations there are large numbers of individuals with hazel brown eyes joined with the light brown or chestnut hair which is the typical hair shade of the English and Americans. This combination is also common in Holland and Westphalia and is frequently associated with a very fair skin. These men are all of \"blond\" aspect and constitution and consequently are to be classed as members of the Nordic race.\" Quoted in Grant, 1922, p. 26.</ref><!-- please do not add information about the (disputed) colour of Hitler's eyes.

The Mediterranean race was also a major influence to the outside world in the modern era:  during the 16th century, [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]] established the first [[Colonial empires|global empire]]s in Western history, setting both nations in the highest level of political and economic powers in Europe.\n\n[[Charles Gabriel Seligman]] also stated that \"it must, I think, be recognised that the Mediterranean race has actually more achievements to its credit than any other race, since it is responsible for by far the greater part of Mediterranean civilisation, certainly before 1000 BC (and probably much later), and so shaped not only the Aegean cultures, but those of Western as well as the greater part of Eastern Mediterranean lands, while the culture of their near relatives, the Hamitic pre-dynastic [[Egyptians]], formed the basis of that of Egypt.\"<ref>''The Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland'', Vol. 54.

The Nazis also claimed that the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese Empire]]s were examples of Nordic power since, at the time, their governments were run by the descendants of the Germanic [[Visigoths]] who invaded Spain and Portugal fifteen centuries earlier.\nHowever, they did admit that the masses of people who lived during the flowering of these four civilizations were Mediterranean.

Members of this alleged master race were referred to as '''''Herrenmenschen''''' (\"master humans\").\n\nThe Nazi theorist [[Alfred Rosenberg]] believed that the Nordic race was descended from [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Proto-Aryans]], who he believed had [[Prehistory|prehistorically]] dwelt on the [[North German Plain]] and ultimately originated on the lost continent of [[Atlantis]].<ref>[[Alfred Rosenberg|Rosenberg, Alfred]], ''[[The Myth of the 20th Century]]''. The term ''Atlantis'' is mentioned two times in the whole book, the term ''Atlantis-hypothesis'' is mentioned just once. Rosenberg (page 24): \"It seems to be not completely impossible, that at parts where today the waves of the Atlantic ocean murmur and icebergs move along, once a blossoming land towered in the water, on which a creative race founded a great culture and sent its children as seafarers and warriors into the world; but if this Atlantis-hypothesis proves untenable, we still have to presume a prehistoric Nordic cultural center.\" Rosenberg (page 26): \"The ridiculed hypothesis about a Nordic creative center, which we can call Atlantis \u2013 without meaning a sunken island \u2013 from where once waves of warriors migrated to all directions as first witnesses of Nordic longing for distant lands to conquer and create, today becomes probable.\" Original: \"''Es erscheint als nicht ganz ausgeschlossen, dass an Stellen, \u00fcber die heute die Wellen des Atlantischen Ozeans rauschen und riesige Eisgebirge herziehen, einst ein bl\u00fchendes Festland aus den Fluten ragte, auf dem eine sch\u00f6pferische Rasse gro\u00dfe, weitausgreifende Kultur erzeugte und ihre Kinder als Seefahrer und Krieger hinaussandte in die Welt; aber selbst wenn sich diese Atlantishypothese als nicht haltbar erweisen sollte, wird ein nordisches vorgeschichtliches Kulturzentrum angenommen werden m\u00fcssen. ...

[[Henri de Boulainvilliers]] in his book ''History of the Ancient Government of France'' (published posthumously in 1727) tried to prove that in [[France]], the nobility represented the descendants of the old [[Franks|Frankish]] ruling class, whereas the rest of the population was descended from the subject [[Gauls]]. Therefore two qualitatively different races were confronting one another, and the only way to abolish the superiority of the Franks was to destroy their civilization.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://edisciplinas.usp.br/pluginfile.php/4179816/mod_resource/content/1/THE%20DESTRUCTION%20OF%20REASON.pdf|title=Luk\u00e1cs, Gy\u00f6rgy  (1952), ''The Destruction of Reason'', p. 668}}</ref> [[Classical liberal]] theorists such as [[Constantin Fran\u00e7ois de Chasseb\u0153uf, comte de Volney|Volney]] and [[Emmanuel Joseph Siey\u00e8s|Siey\u00e8s]] discredited this theory by showing that the French nobility consisted mostly of [[Nouveau riche|nouveaux riches]] who came from all parts of the country, and thus the idea of a racially-pure Frankish lineage was fraudulent.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://edisciplinas.usp.br/pluginfile.php/4179816/mod_resource/content/1/THE%20DESTRUCTION%20OF%20REASON.pdf|title=Luk\u00e1cs, Gy\u00f6rgy  (1952), ''The Destruction of Reason'', p. 669}}</ref>\n\nIn 1855, French count [[Arthur de Gobineau]] published his infamous work ''[[An Essay on the Inequality of the Human Races]]''. Expanding upon Boulainvilliers' use of [[ethnography]] to defend the [[Ancien R\u00e9gime]] against the claims of the [[Third Estate]], Gobineau divides the human species into three major groupings, white, yellow and black, claiming to demonstrate that \"history springs only from contact with the white races.\" Among the white races, he distinguishes the [[Aryan]] race as the pinnacle of human development, the basis of all European aristocracies. However, inevitable [[miscegenation]] led to the \"downfall of civilizations\". The politically [[legitimist]] Gobineau was an enemy of [[democracy]] as much as he was an enemy of miscegenation.\n\nGobineau's influence was slight at first. In his letters to [[Alexis de Tocqueville]], he complained that his book was being hushed up in France and was having a real effect only in the [[United States]]. Tocqueville, who rejected the book in spite of his friendship with Gobineau, pointed out to him that this was because the book chimed with the [[Slavery in the United States|slave-owners']] interests in the Southern states.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://edisciplinas.usp.br/pluginfile.php/4179816/mod_resource/content/1/THE%20DESTRUCTION%20OF%20REASON.pdf|title=Luk\u00e1cs, Gy\u00f6rgy  (1952), ''The Destruction of Reason'', p. 670-1}}</ref> However, in the 1880s the book gained popularity in [[Germany]] thanks to the efforts of [[Cosima Wagner]]. In 1899, [[Houston Stewart Chamberlain]], a [[Germanophile]] Englishman and Cosima Wagner's son-in-law, published ''[[The Foundations of the Nineteenth Century]]''. Expanding upon Gobineau's earlier theories, he argued that that [[Western civilization]] is deeply marked by the influence of the [[Teutons|Teutonic]] peoples. Chamberlain grouped all European peoples\u2014not just Germans, but [[Celts]], [[Slavs]], [[Greeks]], and [[Latins (Italic tribe)|Latins]]\u2014into the \"[[Aryan race]]\", a race built on the ancient [[Proto-Indo-European]] culture. At the helm of the Aryan race, and, indeed, all races, he saw the [[Nordic race|Nordic]] or Teutonic peoples.\n\nThe ''[[\u00dcbermensch]]'' ([[German language|German]]) (\"Overman\" or \"Superman\") is a [[concept]] in the [[Philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche|philosophy of]] [[Germans|German]] [[Philosophy|philosopher]] [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]\u2014he posited the ''\u00dcbermensch'' as a goal for humanity to set for itself in his 1883 book ''[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]'' ({{lang-de|Also Sprach Zarathustra}}).

This reasoning was simultaneously intertwined with [[Nordicism]] which proclaimed that the \"[[Nordic race]]\" was the \"purest\" form of the said [[Aryan race]].  Today, this view is regarded as a form of [[scientific racism]] and contradicts the belief in [[racial equality]] by positing the view that one [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]] is superior to all other races.\n\n===Eugenics===\n[[Eugenics]] came to play a prominent role in this racial thought as a way to improve and maintain the [[Racial purity|purity]] of the Aryan master race.

It commenced with the Revolution, and many of our ablest and most influential men were active in recommending it, and in devising plans for the accomplishment of it. The Legislature encouraged and facilitated emancipation by the owners, and many slaves were so emancipated. The leaning of the courts of justice was always ''in favorem libertatis''. This disposition continued until the impracticability of effecting a general emancipation, without incalculable mischief to the master race, and danger of utter destruction to the other, and the evils consequent on partial emancipations, became too obvious to the Legislature, and to the great majority of the people, to be longer disregarded.<ref>[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/ll/llrd/022/0100/01000191.tif Gales &amp; Seaton's Register, 1836, p191]</ref></blockquote>\n\nThe [[Oxford English Dictionary]] records that [[William J.

It was believed at this time that the peoples of [[Southern Europe]] were racially mixed with non-European [[Moors]] from across the [[Mediterranean Sea]], while the peoples of [[Northern Europe]] and [[Western Europe]] remained pure. Proponents of the Nordic theory further argued that Nordic peoples had developed an innate toughness and determination due to the harsh, challenging climate in which they evolved.\n\nThe philosopher [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] was one of the earliest proponents of a theory presenting a hierarchical racial model of history, attributing civilisational primacy to the \"white races\" who gained their sensitivity and intelligence by refinement in the rigorous [[north]].\n\n<blockquote>The highest civilisation and culture, apart from the Ancient Indians and Egyptians, are found exclusively among the white races; and even with many dark peoples, the ruling caste or race is fairer in colour than the rest and has, therefore, evidently immigrated, for example, the Brahmins, the Incas, and the rulers of the South Sea Islands. All this is because necessity is the mother of invention because those tribes that emigrated early to the north and there gradually became white, had to develop all their intellectual powers and invent and perfect all the arts in their struggle with need, want and misery, which in their many forms were brought about by the climate. This they had to do in order to make up for the parsimony of nature and out of it all came their high civilisation.<ref>Arthur Schopenhauer, ''[[Parerga and Paralipomena]]'', Volume II, Section 92</ref></blockquote>\n\nDespite this, he was adamantly against differing treatment of races, was fervently anti-slavery, and supported the [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] movement in the United States. He describes the treatment of \"[our] innocent black brothers whom force and injustice have delivered into [the slave-master's] devilish clutches\" as \"belonging to the blackest pages of mankind's criminal record\".<ref>''Parerga and Paralipomena'', \"On Ethics,\" Sec. 5</ref>\n\n[[Hans Frank]], Hitler's personal lawyer, stated that Hitler carried a copy of Schopenhauer's book ''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'' with him wherever he went throughout [[World War I]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nobeliefs.com/hitler-myths.htm|title=Hitler Myths|publisher=}}</ref>\n\n[[File:WernerGoldberg.jpg|thumb|175px|[[Werner Goldberg]], who was part Jewish but blond and blue-eyed, was used in Nazi recruitment posters as \"The Ideal German Soldier.\"]]\nThe postulated [[Supremacism|superiority]] of these people was said to make them born leaders, or a \"master race\".{{sfn|Yenne|2010|p=88}} Other authors included [[Guido von List]], his associate [[Lanz von Liebenfels]], and the British-born German racial theorist [[Houston Stewart Chamberlain]], all of whom felt that the white race in general and [[Germanic peoples]] in particular were superior to others, and that given the [[Racial purity|purification]] of both the white race and the German people from the other races which were \"polluting\" them, a new [[Millenarianism|millenarian]] age of Aryan god-men would arrive.{{sfn|Yenne|2010|pp=22\u201325, 88}}\n\nNazi policy stressed the superiority of the Germanic ''Ubermenschen'' (superhuman) [[Nordic race]], a sub-race of the [[White people#19th and 20th century: the .22Caucasian race.22|white Caucasian race]] European population defined by [[anthropometric]] models of racial difference.

K. G\u00fcnther]] first defined \"Nordic thought\" in his programmatic book ''Der Nordische Gedanke unter den Deutschen''. The fact that Germans were not purely Nordic was acknowledged by G\u00fcnther in his book ''[[Rassenkunde des deutschen Volkes]]'' (1922) (\"Racial Science of the German People\"), in which he described the German people as being made up of all five of his European racial categories: Nordic, Mediterranean, [[Dinaric race|Dinaric]], [[Alpine race|Alpine]], and [[East Baltic race|East Baltic]].<ref name=Maxwell150 >Anne Maxwell.

For example, [[Adolf Hitler]] and many Nazi officials had dark hair and were still considered members of the [[Aryan race]] under Nazi racial doctrine, because the determination of an individual's racial type depended on a preponderance of many characteristics in an individual rather than on just one defining feature.<ref>\"The range of blond hair color in pure Nordic peoples runs from flaxen and red to shades of chestnut and brown... It must be clearly understood that blondness of hair and of eye is not a final test of Nordic race. The Nordics include all the blonds, and also those of darker hair or eye when possessed of a preponderance of other Nordic characters. In this sense the word \"blond\" means those lighter shades of hair or eye color in contrast to the very dark or black shades which are termed brunet. The meaning of \"blond\" as now used is therefore not limited to the lighter or flaxen shades as in colloquial speech. In England among Nordic populations there are large numbers of individuals with hazel brown eyes joined with the light brown or chestnut hair which is the typical hair shade of the English and Americans. This combination is also common in Holland and Westphalia and is frequently associated with a very fair skin. These men are all of \"blond\" aspect and constitution and consequently are to be classed as members of the Nordic race.\" Quoted in Grant, 1922, p. 26.</ref><!-- please do not add information about the (disputed) colour of Hitler's eyes.

They were supposed to be the ancestors of the ancient [[Germanic tribes]], who shared their warrior values. Rosenberg claimed that [[Christianity]] was an alien [[Semitic people|Semitic]] [[master-slave morality|slave-morality]] which was inappropriate for the warrior Aryan master race and he thus supported a melange of aspects of [[Hindu]] [[Historical Vedic religion|Vedic]] and [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] teachings (both of these religions having been organised by Aryans), along with pre-Christian European [[Odinism|Odinistic paganism]], which he also considered distinctively Aryan in character.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\">[[Alfred Rosenberg|Rosenberg, Alfred]] ''[[The Myth of the Twentieth Century|Der Mythus des 20.

The Mediterranean race was also a major influence to the outside world in the modern era:  during the 16th century, [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]] established the first [[Colonial empires|global empire]]s in Western history, setting both nations in the highest level of political and economic powers in Europe.\n\n[[Charles Gabriel Seligman]] also stated that \"it must, I think, be recognised that the Mediterranean race has actually more achievements to its credit than any other race, since it is responsible for by far the greater part of Mediterranean civilisation, certainly before 1000 BC (and probably much later), and so shaped not only the Aegean cultures, but those of Western as well as the greater part of Eastern Mediterranean lands, while the culture of their near relatives, the Hamitic pre-dynastic [[Egyptians]], formed the basis of that of Egypt.\"<ref>''The Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland'', Vol. 54.

The Nazis also claimed that the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese Empire]]s were examples of Nordic power since, at the time, their governments were run by the descendants of the Germanic [[Visigoths]] who invaded Spain and Portugal fifteen centuries earlier.\nHowever, they did admit that the masses of people who lived during the flowering of these four civilizations were Mediterranean.

There have been several types os research locally, ranging from the predominant study of the geology and sedimentology on the formation and associated layers, along with the geochemical, climatic, and ecosistemic research to set the different changes that have been documented along the formation. Paleogeography, paleontology, palynology, tectonics, and several other kinds of works have been done along the Formation. The most studied section has been the German, with the other being found as part of the Posidonia on late 1960-80s works, and most of them not covered yet.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\n=== 1800s ===\n[[File:Friedrich August von Quenstedt.jpg|thumb|right|Friedrich August von Quenstedt a German Mineralogist that studied the jurassic strata along Germany, including the Black Shales of the Posidonia Shale.]]\nThe first related studies with the Posidonia Shale Strata where done on the Early 1800.

There have been several types os research locally, ranging from the predominant study of the geology and sedimentology on the formation and associated layers, along with the geochemical, climatic, and ecosistemic research to set the different changes that have been documented along the formation. Paleogeography, paleontology, palynology, tectonics, and several other kinds of works have been done along the Formation. The most studied section has been the German, with the other being found as part of the Posidonia on late 1960-80s works, and most of them not covered yet.{{cn|date=April 2020}}\n\n=== 1800s ===\n[[File:Friedrich August von Quenstedt.jpg|thumb|right|Friedrich August von Quenstedt a German Mineralogist that studied the jurassic strata along Germany, including the Black Shales of the Posidonia Shale.]]\nThe first related studies with the Posidonia Shale Strata where done on the Early 1800.

Between the summers of 2007 and 2009 he spent season-long loans with German lower-tier clubs [[Eintracht Braunschweig]] and [[FC Carl Zeiss Jena|Carl Zeiss Jena]]. After a blighted six months with [[SK Austria K\u00e4rnten|Austria K\u00e4rnten]], he joined Hungarian side [[Ferencv\u00e1rosi TC|Ferencv\u00e1ros]] where he established himself as first choice ending the season as the club's top scorer with 17 goals in all competitions.\n\nIn the summer of 2011, Schembri joined [[Olympiacos Volou 1937 F.C.|Olympiacos Volou]] however after a few games the club was demoted to the fourth-tier of Greek football following a [[Koriopolis|match-fixing scandal]]. As a result, Schembri joined [[Panionios F.C.|Panionios]]. After completing the [[2011\u201312 Superleague Greece|2011\u201312]] season, Schembri was signed by Cypriot club [[AC Omonia|Omonia]]. With them he slowly established himself in the forward line finishing his second season as the league's second highest goalscorer with 17 goals. After a short stint with German club [[FSV Frankfurt]], he returned to Omonia in December 2014.\n\nWith interest from foreign clubs, Portuguese side [[Boavista F.C.|Boavista]] signed Schembri. Although initially making the first eleven, the arrival of a new manager midway through the season led to him being dropped to a substitute role. With lack of opportunities, Schembri returned to Cyprus, joining Apollon Limassol in the summer of 2017. He quickly became a prominent figure, scoring four goals in six qualifying matches as he helped the club make it through to the group stages of the [[UEFA Europa League]]. In this same competition he also became the first Maltese to score in the proper rounds of a UEFA competition. In August 2017, he won his first trophy outside his home country as Apollon Limassol triumphed in the [[Cypriot Super Cup]], with Schembri also scoring the winning goal.\n\nAt the international level, he represented Malta at youth levels, before making his senior debut on 4 June 2006 against [[Japan national football team|Japan]]. His first goals came in the historic 2\u20131 win over [[Hungary national football team|Hungary]], scoring twice as Malta won their first competitive game in 13 years.

Between the summers of 2007 and 2009 he spent season-long loans with German lower-tier clubs [[Eintracht Braunschweig]] and [[FC Carl Zeiss Jena|Carl Zeiss Jena]]. After a blighted six months with [[SK Austria K\u00e4rnten|Austria K\u00e4rnten]], he joined Hungarian side [[Ferencv\u00e1rosi TC|Ferencv\u00e1ros]] where he established himself as first choice ending the season as the club's top scorer with 17 goals in all competitions.\n\nIn the summer of 2011, Schembri joined [[Olympiacos Volou 1937 F.C.|Olympiacos Volou]] however after a few games the club was demoted to the fourth-tier of Greek football following a [[Koriopolis|match-fixing scandal]]. As a result, Schembri joined [[Panionios F.C.|Panionios]]. After completing the [[2011\u201312 Superleague Greece|2011\u201312]] season, Schembri was signed by Cypriot club [[AC Omonia|Omonia]]. With them he slowly established himself in the forward line finishing his second season as the league's second highest goalscorer with 17 goals. After a short stint with German club [[FSV Frankfurt]], he returned to Omonia in December 2014.\n\nWith interest from foreign clubs, Portuguese side [[Boavista F.C.|Boavista]] signed Schembri. Although initially making the first eleven, the arrival of a new manager midway through the season led to him being dropped to a substitute role. With lack of opportunities, Schembri returned to Cyprus, joining Apollon Limassol in the summer of 2017. He quickly became a prominent figure, scoring four goals in six qualifying matches as he helped the club make it through to the group stages of the [[UEFA Europa League]]. In this same competition he also became the first Maltese to score in the proper rounds of a UEFA competition. In August 2017, he won his first trophy outside his home country as Apollon Limassol triumphed in the [[Cypriot Super Cup]], with Schembri also scoring the winning goal.\n\nAt the international level, he represented Malta at youth levels, before making his senior debut on 4 June 2006 against [[Japan national football team|Japan]].
