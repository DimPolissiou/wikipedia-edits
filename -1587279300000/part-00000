With the rapid growth of the Internet after commercialization in the 1990s, it became evident that far more addresses would be needed to connect devices than the IPv4 address space had available. By 1998, the [[Internet Engineering Task Force]] (IETF) had formalized the successor protocol. IPv6 uses a [[128-bit]] address, theoretically allowing 2<sup>128</sup>, or approximately {{val|3.4|e=38}} addresses. The actual number is slightly smaller, as multiple ranges are reserved for special use or completely excluded from use.  The two protocols are not designed to be [[interoperable]], and thus direct communication between them is impossible, complicating the move to IPv6. However, several [[IPv6 transition mechanisms|transition mechanisms]] have been devised to rectify this.\n\nIPv6 provides other technical benefits in addition to a larger addressing space. In particular, it permits hierarchical address allocation methods that facilitate [[route aggregation]] across the Internet, and thus limit the expansion of [[routing table]]s. The use of multicast addressing is expanded and simplified, and provides additional optimization for the delivery of services. Device mobility, security, and configuration aspects have been considered in the design of the protocol.\n\nIPv6 addresses are represented as eight groups, separated by colons, of four [[hexadecimal]] digits. The full representation may be simplified by several methods of notation; for example, ''2001:0db8:0000:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334'' becomes ''2001:db8::8a2e:370:7334''.\n\n{{toc level|3}}\n\n==Main features==\n[[File:Ipv6 address leading zeros.svg|thumb|300px|Decomposition of the [[IPv6 address]] representation into its binary form]]\nIPv6 is an [[Internet Layer]] protocol for [[Packet switching|packet-switched]] [[internetworking]] and provides end-to-end [[datagram]] transmission across multiple IP networks, closely adhering to the design principles developed in the previous version of the protocol, [[IPv4|Internet Protocol Version 4]] (IPv4).\n\nIn addition to offering more addresses, IPv6 also implements features not present in IPv4. It simplifies aspects of address configuration, network renumbering, and router announcements when changing network connectivity providers. It simplifies processing of packets in routers by placing the responsibility for packet fragmentation into the end points. The IPv6 [[subnetwork|subnet]] size is standardized by fixing the size of the host identifier portion of an address to 64 bits.\n\nThe addressing architecture of IPv6 is defined in {{IETF RFC|4291}} and allows three different types of transmission: [[unicast]], [[anycast]] and [[multicast]].<ref name=\"Rosen kernel networking\">{{Cite book|title=Linux Kernel Networking: Implementation and Theory| author=Rami Rosen | publisher=Apress | year=2014|isbn=9781430261971|location = New York|oclc=869747983}}</ref>{{rp|210}}\n\n==Motivation and origin==\n\n===IPv4 address exhaustion===\n[[Image:Ipv4 address.svg|right|300px|thumb|Decomposition of the quad-dotted [[IPv4 address]] representation to its binary value]]\n[[IPv4|Internet Protocol Version 4]] (IPv4) was the first publicly used version of the [[Internet Protocol]]. IPv4 was developed as a research project by the [[DARPA|Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency]] (DARPA), a [[United States Department of Defense]] [[government agency|agency]], before becoming the foundation for the [[Internet]] and the [[World Wide Web]]. IPv4 includes an addressing system that uses numerical identifiers consisting of 32 bits. These addresses are typically displayed in [[quad-dotted notation]] as decimal values of four octets, each in the range 0 to 255, or 8 bits per number. Thus, IPv4 provides an addressing capability of 2<sup>32</sup> or approximately 4.3 billion addresses. Address exhaustion was not initially a concern in IPv4 as this version was originally presumed to be a test of DARPA's networking concepts.<ref>{{cite video|title=Google IPv6 Conference 2008: What will the IPv6 Internet look like?|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZo69JQoLb8|time=13:35}}</ref> During the first decade of operation of the Internet, it became apparent that methods had to be developed to conserve address space. In the early 1990s, even after the redesign of the addressing system using a [[Classless Inter-Domain Routing|classless network]] model, it became clear that this would not suffice to prevent [[IPv4 address exhaustion]], and that further changes to the Internet infrastructure were needed.<ref name=rfc1752>{{cite IETF |title= The Recommendation for the IP Next Generation Protocol|rfc=1752 |first=S.|last=Bradner|first2=A.|last2=Mankin|date=January 1995|publisher=[[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]]}}</ref>\n\nThe last unassigned top-level address blocks of 16 million IPv4 addresses were allocated in February 2011 by the [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority]] (IANA) to the five [[regional Internet registry|regional Internet registries]] (RIRs). However, each RIR still has available address pools and is expected to continue with standard address allocation policies until one /8 [[Classless Inter-Domain Routing]] (CIDR) block remains. After that, only blocks of 1024 addresses (/22) will be provided from the RIRs to a [[local Internet registry]] (LIR).

However, most transport and application-layer protocols need little or no change to operate over IPv6; exceptions are application protocols that embed Internet-layer addresses, such as [[File Transfer Protocol]] (FTP) and [[Network Time Protocol]] (NTP), where the new address format may cause conflicts with existing protocol syntax.\n\n===Larger address space===\nThe main advantage of IPv6 over IPv4 is its larger address space. The length of an IPv6 address is 128 bits, compared with 32 bits in IPv4.<ref name=rfc2460/> The address space therefore has 2<sup>128</sup> = 340,282,366,920,938,463,463,374,607,431,768,211,456 addresses (approximately {{val|3.4|e=38}} or 340 billion billion billion billion). As with IPv4, some of these addresses are [[Reserved IP addresses|reserved for special uses]].\n\nIn addition, the IPv4 address space is poorly allocated; in 2011, approximately 14% of all available addresses were utilized.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-30685_3-20030482-264.html|title=Moving to IPv6: Now for the hard part (FAQ)|publisher=CNET News|work=Deep Tech|accessdate=3 February 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110209082433/http://news.cnet.com/8301-30685_3-20030482-264.html|archive-date=9 February 2011}}</ref> While these numbers are large, it was not the intent of the designers of the IPv6 address space to assure geographical saturation{{clarify|date=September 2016}} with usable addresses. Rather, the longer addresses simplify allocation of addresses, enable efficient [[route aggregation]], and allow implementation of special addressing features. In IPv4, complex [[Classless Inter-Domain Routing]] (CIDR) methods were developed to make the best use of the small address space. The standard size of a subnet in IPv6 is 2<sup>64</sup> addresses, more than 4 billion times the size of the entire IPv4 address space. Thus, actual address space utilization rates will be small in IPv6, but network management and routing efficiency are improved by the large subnet space and hierarchical route aggregation.\n\n===Multicasting===\n[[Multicast]]ing, the transmission of a packet to multiple destinations in a single send operation, is part of the base specification in IPv6. In IPv4 this is an optional (although commonly implemented) feature.<ref name=rfc1112>{{IETF RFC|1112}}, ''Host extensions for IP multicasting'', S. Deering (August 1989)</ref> IPv6 multicast addressing has features and protocols in common with IPv4 multicast, but also provides changes and improvements by eliminating the need for certain protocols. IPv6 does not implement traditional [[Broadcast IP address|IP broadcast]], i.e. the transmission of a packet to all hosts on the attached link using a special ''broadcast address'', and therefore does not define broadcast addresses. In IPv6, the same result is achieved by sending a packet to the link-local ''all nodes'' multicast group at address ff02::1, which is analogous to IPv4 multicasting to address 224.0.0.1. IPv6 also provides for new multicast implementations, including embedding rendezvous point addresses in an IPv6 multicast group address, which simplifies the deployment of inter-domain solutions.<ref name=rfc3956>{{IETF RFC|3956}}, ''Embedding the Rendezvous Point (RP) Address in an IPv6 Multicast Address'', P. Savola, B. Haberman (November 2004)</ref>\n\nIn IPv4 it is very difficult for an organization to get even one globally routable multicast group assignment, and the implementation of inter-domain solutions is arcane.<ref>{{IETF RFC|2908}}, ''The Internet Multicast Address Allocation Architecture'', D. Thaler, M. Handley, D. Estrin (September 2000)</ref> Unicast address assignments by a [[local Internet registry]] for IPv6 have at least a 64-bit routing prefix, yielding the smallest subnet size available in IPv6 (also 64 bits). With such an assignment it is possible to embed the unicast address prefix into the IPv6 multicast address format, while still providing a 32-bit block, the least significant bits of the address, or approximately 4.2 billion multicast group identifiers. Thus each user of an IPv6 subnet automatically has available a set of globally routable source-specific multicast groups for multicast applications.<ref>{{IETF RFC|3306}}, ''Unicast-Prefix-based IPv6 Multicast Addresses'', B. Haberman, D. Thaler (August 2002)</ref>\n\n===Stateless address autoconfiguration (SLAAC)===\n{{See also|IPv6 address#Stateless address autoconfiguration|l1=IPv6 address \u00a7 Stateless address autoconfiguration}}\n\nIPv6 hosts configure themselves automatically. Every interface has a self-generated link-local address and, when connected to a network, conflict resolution is performed and routers provide network prefixes via router advertisements.<ref name=rfc4862/> Stateless configuration of routers can be achieved with a special router renumbering protocol.<ref name=rfc2894>{{IETF RFC|2894}}, ''Router Renumbering for IPv6'', M. Crawford, August 2000.</ref> When necessary, hosts may configure additional stateful addresses via [[DHCPv6|Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol version 6]] (DHCPv6) or static addresses manually.\n\nLike IPv4, IPv6 supports globally unique [[IP address]]es. The design of IPv6 intended to re-emphasize the end-to-end principle of network design that was originally conceived during the establishment of the early Internet by rendering [[network address translation]] obsolete. Therefore, every device on the network is globally addressable directly from any other device.\n\nA stable, unique, globally addressable IP address would facilitate tracking a device across networks. Therefore, such addresses are a particular privacy concern for mobile devices, such as laptops and cell phones.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.internetsociety.org/resources/deploy360/2014/privacy-extensions-for-ipv6-slaac/ |title= Privacy Extensions for Stateless Address Autoconfiguration in IPv6 |author=T.

IPsec was a mandatory part of all IPv6 protocol implementations,<ref name=rfc2460/> and [[Internet Key Exchange]] (IKE) was recommended, but with RFC 6434 the inclusion of IPsec in IPv6 implementations was downgraded to a recommendation because it was considered impractical to require full IPsec implementation for all types of devices that may use IPv6. However, as of RFC 4301 IPv6 protocol implementations that do implement IPsec need to implement IKEv2 and need to support a minimum set of [[Cryptography|cryptographic algorithms]]. This requirement will help to make IPsec implementations more interoperable between devices from different vendors. The IPsec Authentication Header (AH) and the Encapsulating Security Payload header (ESP) are implemented as IPv6 extension headers.<ref>{{Cite book |title=IPv6 Essentials: Integrating IPv6 Into Your IPv4 Network |author=Silvia Hagen |publisher=O'Reilly Media |year=2014 |isbn=978-1-4493-3526-7 |page=196 |edition=3rd |location=Sebastopol, CA |oclc=881832733}}</ref>\n\n===Simplified processing by routers===\nThe packet header in IPv6 is simpler than the IPv4 header. Many rarely used fields have been moved to optional header extensions.<ref name=\"History of Domain Names\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.historyofdomainnames.com/ipv6/|title=The History of Domain Names {{!}} IPv6|website=www.historyofdomainnames.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612211153/http://www.historyofdomainnames.com/ipv6/|archive-date=12 June 2018}}</ref> With the simplified IPv6 packet header the process of packet forwarding by [[Router (computing)|routers]] has been simplified. Although IPv6 packet headers are at least twice the size of IPv4 packet headers, processing of packets that only contain the base IPv6 header by routers may, in some case, be more efficient, because less processing is required in routers due to the headers being aligned to match common [[Word (computer architecture)|word sizes]].<ref name=rfc2460/><ref name=rfc1726/> However, many devices implement IPv6 support in software (as opposed to hardware), thus resulting in very bad packet processing performance.<ref>{{cite web|title=IPv6 Security Assessment and Benchmarking|first=E.|last=Zack|date=July 2013|url=http://www.ipv6hackers.org/meetings/ipv6-hackers-1}}</ref> Additionally, for many implementations, the use of Extension Headers causes packets to be processed by a router's CPU, leading to poor performance or even security issues.<ref name=draft-gont-v6ops-ipv6-ehs-packet-drops-03>{{cite web|work=draft-gont-v6ops-ipv6-ehs-packet-drops-03|title=Operational Implications of IPv6 Packets with Extension Headers|first=F.|last=Gont|date=March 2016|url=https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-gont-v6ops-ipv6-ehs-packet-drops-03}}</ref>\n\nMoreover, an IPv6 header does not include a checksum. The [[IPv4 header checksum]] is calculated for the IPv4 header, and has to be recalculated by routers every time the [[time to live]] (called [[hop limit]] in the IPv6 protocol) is reduced by one. The absence of a checksum in the IPv6 header furthers the [[end-to-end principle]] of Internet design, which envisioned that most processing in the network occurs in the leaf nodes. Integrity protection for the data that is encapsulated in the IPv6 packet is assumed to be assured by both the [[link layer]] or error detection in higher-layer protocols, namely the [[Transmission Control Protocol]] (TCP) and the [[User Datagram Protocol]] (UDP) on the [[transport layer]]. Thus, while IPv4 allowed UDP datagram headers to have no checksum (indicated by 0 in the header field), IPv6 requires a checksum in UDP headers.\n\nIPv6 routers do not perform [[IP fragmentation]]. IPv6 hosts are required to either perform [[path MTU discovery]], perform end-to-end fragmentation, or to send packets no larger than the default [[Maximum transmission unit]] (MTU), which is 1280 [[octet (computing)|octets]].\n\n===Mobility===\nUnlike mobile IPv4, [[mobile IPv6]] avoids [[triangular routing]] and is therefore as efficient as native IPv6. IPv6 routers may also allow entire subnets to move to a new router connection point without renumbering.<ref name=rfc3963>{{IETF RFC|3963}}, ''Network Mobility (NEMO) Basic Protocol Support'', V. Devarapalli, R. Wakikawa, A. Petrescu, P. Thubert (January 2005)</ref>\n\n===Extension headers===\nThe IPv6 packet header has a minimum size of 40 octets (320 bits). Options are implemented as extensions. This provides the opportunity to extend the protocol in the future without affecting the core packet structure.<ref name=rfc2460/> However, RFC 7872 notes that some network operators drop IPv6 packets with extension headers when they traverse transit [[Autonomous system (Internet)|autonomous systems]].\n\n====Jumbograms====\nIPv4 limits packets to 65,535 (2<sup>16</sup>\u22121) octets of payload. An IPv6 node can optionally handle packets over this limit, referred to as [[jumbogram]]s, which can be as large as 4,294,967,295 (2<sup>32</sup>\u22121) octets. The use of jumbograms may improve performance over high-[[Maximum transmission unit|MTU]] links. The use of jumbograms is indicated by the Jumbo Payload Option extension header.<ref name=rfc2675>{{IETF RFC|2675}}, ''IPv6 Jumbograms'', D. Borman, [[Steve Deering|S. Deering]], R. Hinden (August 1999)</ref>\n\n==IPv6 packets==\n{{Main|IPv6 packet}}\n[[File:Ipv6 header.svg|thumb|IPv6 packet header]]\n\nAn IPv6 packet has two parts: a [[Header (computing)|header]] and [[Payload (computing)|payload]].\n\nThe header consists of a fixed portion with minimal functionality required for all packets and may be followed by optional extensions to implement special features.\n\nThe fixed header occupies the first 40&nbsp;[[octet (computing)|octets]] (320 bits) of the IPv6 packet. It contains the source and destination addresses, traffic classification options, a hop counter, and the type of the optional extension or payload which follows the header. This ''Next Header'' field tells the receiver how to interpret the data which follows the header. If the packet contains options, this field contains the option type of the next option. The \"Next Header\" field of the last option, points to the upper-layer protocol that is carried in the packet's [[payload (computing)|payload]].\n\nExtension headers carry options that are used for special treatment of a packet in the network, e.g., for routing, fragmentation, and for security using the [[IPsec]] framework.\n\nWithout special options, a payload must be less than {{gaps|64|kB}}. With a Jumbo Payload option (in a ''Hop-By-Hop Options'' extension header), the payload must be less than 4&nbsp;GB.\n\nUnlike with IPv4, routers never fragment a packet. Hosts are expected to use [[Path MTU Discovery]] to make their packets small enough to reach the destination without needing to be fragmented. See [[IPv6 packet#Fragmentation|IPv6 packet fragmentation]].\n\n==Addressing==\n[[IPv6 address]]es have 128 bits. The design of the IPv6 address space implements a different design philosophy than in IPv4, in which subnetting was used to improve the efficiency of utilization of the small address space. In IPv6, the address space is deemed large enough for the foreseeable future, and a local area subnet always uses 64 bits for the host portion of the address, designated as the interface identifier, while the most-significant 64 bits are used as the routing prefix.<ref>{{IETF RFC|4291}}, p. 9</ref> While the myth has existed regarding IPv6 subnets being impossible to scan, RFC 7707 notes that patterns resulting from some IPv6 address configuration techniques and algorithms allow for address scanning in many real-world scenarios.\n\n===Address representation===\nThe 128 bits of an IPv6 address are represented in 8 groups of 16 bits each.

For example, the group {{IPaddr|0042}} is converted to {{IPaddr|42}}.\n* Consecutive sections of zeros are replaced with a double colon (::). The double colon may only be used once in an address, as multiple use would render the address indeterminate. {{IETF RFC|5952}} requires that a double colon not be used to denote an omitted single section of zeros.<ref name=rfc5952sec422>{{cite web|rfc=5952|title=A Recommendation for IPv6 Address Text Representation|author=S.

Kawamura| url = https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5952| date=August 2010}}</ref>\n\n===Link-local address===\nAll interfaces of IPv6 hosts require a [[link-local address]]. IPv6 link-local addresses have the prefix {{IPaddr|fe80::|10}}. This prefix is combined with a 64 bit suffix, which the host can compute and/or assign by itself\u2014without configuration and without the presence or cooperation of an external network component like a DHCP server.\n\nThe lower 64 bits of the link local address (the suffix) were originally derived from the MAC address of the underlying network interface card. As this method of assigning addresses would cause undesirable address changes when faulty network cards were replaced, and as it also suffered from a number of security and privacy issues, RFC 8064 has replaced the original MAC-based method with the hash-based method specified in RFC 7217.\n\n===Address uniqueness and router solicitation===\nIPv6 uses a new mechanism for mapping IP addresses to link layer addresses (MAC addresses), because it does not support the broadcast addressing method, on which the functionality of the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) in IPv4 is based. IPv6 implements the Neighbor Discovery Protocol (NDP, ND) in the link layer, which relies on  and transmission. IPv6 hosts verify the uniqueness of their IPv6 addresses in a local area network (LAN) by sending a neighbor solicitation message asking for the link layer address of the IP address. If any other host in the LAN is using that address, it responds.\n\n\n* The Manage bit, that indicates whether or not the host should use DHCP to obtain additional addresses rather than rely on an auto-configured address from the router advertisement.\n* The Other bit, that indicates whether or not the host should obtain other information through DHCP. The other information consists of one or more prefix information options for the subnets that the host is attached to, a lifetime for the prefix, and two flags:\n** On-link: If this flag is set, the host will treat all addresses on the specific subnet as being on-link, and send packets directly to them instead of sending them to a router for the duration of the given lifetime.\n** Address: This is the flag that tells the host to actually create a global address.\n\n===Global addressing===\nThe assignment procedure for global addresses is similar to local address construction.

This permits dual-stack hosts to participate in IPv6 and IPv4 networks simultaneously. The method is defined in {{IETF RFC|4213}}.<ref>{{cite web|rfc=4213|title=Basic Transition Mechanisms for IPv6 Hosts and Routers|publisher=IETF| url =https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4213 |accessdate=2012-08-20}}</ref>\n\nA device with dual-stack implementation in the operating system has an IPv4 and IPv6 address, and can communicate with other nodes in the LAN or the Internet using either IPv4 or IPv6. The [[Domain Name System]] (DNS) protocol is used by both IP protocols to resolve [[fully qualified domain name]]s (FQDN) and IP addresses, but dual stack requires that the resolving DNS server can resolve both types of addresses. Such a dual stack DNS server would hold IPv4 addresses in the A records, and IPv6 addresses in the AAAA records. Depending on the destination that is to be resolved, a DNS name server may return an IPv4 or IPv6 IP address, or both. A default address selection mechanism, or preferred protocol, needs to be configured either on hosts or the DNS server. The [[IETF]] has published [[Happy Eyeballs]] to assist dual stack applications, so that they can connect using both IPv4 and IPv6, but prefer an IPv6 connection if it is available. However, dual-stack also needs to be implemented on all [[Router (computing)|routers]] between the host and the service for which the DNS server has returned an IPv6 address. Dual-stack clients should only be configured to prefer IPv6, if the network is able to forward IPv6 packets using the IPv6 versions of [[routing protocols]]. When dual stack networks protocols are in place the [[application layer]] can be migrated to IPv6.<ref>{{Cite book|title=IPv6 Essentials: Integrating IPv6 Into Your IPv4 Network| author=Silvia Hagen |publisher=O'Reilly Media, Inc. |year=2014|isbn=9781449335267|pages=222}}</ref>\n\nWhile dual-stack is supported by major [[operating system]] and [[network device]] vendors, legacy networking hardware and servers don't support IPv6.\n\n=== ISP customers with public-facing IPv6 ===\n[[File:IPv6 Prefix Assignment Example-en.svg|thumb|500px|IPv6 Prefix Assignment mechanism with IANA, RIRs, and ISPs.]]\n[[Internet service providers]] (ISPs) are increasingly providing their business and private customers with public-facing IPv6 global unicast addresses. However, if in the local area network (LAN) IPv4 is still used, and the ISP can only provide a public facing IPv6, the IPv4 LAN addresses are translated into the public facing IPv6 address using [[NAT64]], a [[network address translation]] (NAT) mechanism. Some ISPs cannot provide their customers with public-facing IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, thus supporting dual stack networking, because some ISPs have exhausted their globally routable IPv4 address pool. Meanwhile, ISP customers are still trying to reach IPv4 [[web servers]] and other destinations.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.juniper.net/documentation/en_US/junos/topics/concept/ipv6-dual-stack-understanding.html |title= Understanding Dual Stacking of IPv4 and IPv6 Unicast Addresses | author=Juniper TechLibrary |date= 31 August 2017 |website= www.juniper.net |access-date= 13 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nA significant percentage of ISPs in all [[regional Internet registry]] (RIR) zones have obtained IPv6 address space.

ISPs report the share of IPv6 traffic from customers over their network to be anything between 20% and 40%, but by mid-2017 IPv6 traffic still only accounted for a fraction of total traffic at several large [[Internet exchange point]]s (IXPs). [[AMS-IX]] reported it to be 2% and [[SeattleIX]] reported 7%. A 2017 survey found that many DSL customers that were served by a dual stack ISP did not request DNS servers to resolve fully qualified domain names into IPv6 addresses. The survey also found that the majority of traffic from IPv6-ready webserver resources were still requested and served over IPv4, mostly due to ISP customers that did not use the dual stack facility provided by their ISP and to a lesser extent due to customers of IPv4-only ISPs.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://blog.apnic.net/2017/06/13/stops-ipv6-traffic-dual-stack-isp/ |title= What stops IPv6 traffic in a dual-stack ISP? | author=  Enric Pujol |date=  2017-06-12|website= www.apnic.net |access-date= 13 Jun 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Tunneling===\nThe technical basis for tunneling, or encapsulating IPv6 packets in IPv4 packets, is outlined in RFC 4213.

Teredo is outlined in RFC 4380 and allows IPv6 [[local area networks]] to tunnel over IPv4 networks, by encapsulating IPv6 packets within UDP. The Teredo relay is an IPv6 router that mediates between a Teredo server and the native IPv6 network. It was expected that 6to4 and Teredo would be widely deployed until ISP networks would switch to native IPv6, but by 2014 Google Statistics showed that the use of both mechanisms had dropped to almost 0.<ref>{{Cite book|title=IPv6 Essentials: Integrating IPv6 Into Your IPv4 Network| author=Silvia Hagen |publisher=O'Reilly Media, Inc. |year=2014|isbn=9781449335267|pages=33}}</ref>\n\n===IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses===\nHybrid dual-stack IPv6/IPv4 implementations recognize a special class of addresses, the IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses. These addresses are typically written with a 96-bit prefix in the standard IPv6 format, and the remaining 32 bits written in the customary [[dot-decimal notation]] of IPv4.\n\nAddresses in this group consist of an 80-bit prefix of zeros, the next 16 bits are ones, and the remaining, least-significant 32 bits contain the IPv4 address. For example, ::ffff:192.0.2.128 represents the IPv4 address 192.0.2.128. Another format, called \"IPv4-compatible IPv6 address\", is ::192.0.2.128; however, this method is deprecated.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4291#section-2.5.5.1|title=RFC 4291 - IP Version 6 Addressing Architecture, section 2.5.5.1.

Some common IPv6 stacks do not implement the IPv4-mapped address feature, either because the IPv6 and IPv4 stacks are separate implementations (e.g., [[Microsoft Windows]] 2000, XP, and Server 2003), or because of security concerns ([[OpenBSD]]).<ref name=openbsd-mapped-addr>{{man|4|inet6|OpenBSD}}</ref> On these operating systems, a program must open a separate socket for each IP protocol it uses.

IPv6 is intended to replace [[IPv4]].<ref name=\"ipv6nz\">{{Cite web|url=https://www.ipv6.org.nz/ipv6-faqs/|title=FAQs|author=New Zealand IPv6 Task Force|accessdate=26 October 2015}}</ref> In December 1998, IPv6 became a Draft Standard for the IETF,<ref name=\"rfc2460\" /> who subsequently ratified it as an [[Internet Standard]] on 14 July 2017.<ref name=\"rfc8200\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.internetsociety.org/blog/2017/07/rfc-8200-ipv6-has-been-standardized/ | title=RFC 8200 \u2013 IPv6 has been standardized | first=Aftab |last=Siddiqui |publisher=Internet Society | date=17 July 2017 |access-date=25 February 2018}}</ref>\n\nDevices on the Internet are assigned a unique [[IP address]] for identification and location definition. With the rapid growth of the Internet after commercialization in the 1990s, it became evident that far more addresses would be needed to connect devices than the IPv4 address space had available. By 1998, the [[Internet Engineering Task Force]] (IETF) had formalized the successor protocol. IPv6 uses a [[128-bit]] address, theoretically allowing 2<sup>128</sup>, or approximately {{val|3.4|e=38}} addresses. The actual number is slightly smaller, as multiple ranges are reserved for special use or completely excluded from use.  The two protocols are not designed to be [[interoperable]], and thus direct communication between them is impossible, complicating the move to IPv6. However, several [[IPv6 transition mechanisms|transition mechanisms]] have been devised to rectify this.\n\nIPv6 provides other technical benefits in addition to a larger addressing space. In particular, it permits hierarchical address allocation methods that facilitate [[route aggregation]] across the Internet, and thus limit the expansion of [[routing table]]s. The use of multicast addressing is expanded and simplified, and provides additional optimization for the delivery of services. Device mobility, security, and configuration aspects have been considered in the design of the protocol.\n\nIPv6 addresses are represented as eight groups, separated by colons, of four [[hexadecimal]] digits. The full representation may be simplified by several methods of notation; for example, ''2001:0db8:0000:0000:0000:8a2e:0370:7334'' becomes ''2001:db8::8a2e:370:7334''.\n\n{{toc level|3}}\n\n==Main features==\n[[File:Ipv6 address leading zeros.svg|thumb|300px|Decomposition of the [[IPv6 address]] representation into its binary form]]\nIPv6 is an [[Internet Layer]] protocol for [[Packet switching|packet-switched]] [[internetworking]] and provides end-to-end [[datagram]] transmission across multiple IP networks, closely adhering to the design principles developed in the previous version of the protocol, [[IPv4|Internet Protocol Version 4]] (IPv4).\n\nIn addition to offering more addresses, IPv6 also implements features not present in IPv4. It simplifies aspects of address configuration, network renumbering, and router announcements when changing network connectivity providers. It simplifies processing of packets in routers by placing the responsibility for packet fragmentation into the end points. The IPv6 [[subnetwork|subnet]] size is standardized by fixing the size of the host identifier portion of an address to 64 bits.\n\nThe addressing architecture of IPv6 is defined in {{IETF RFC|4291}} and allows three different types of transmission: [[unicast]], [[anycast]] and [[multicast]].<ref name=\"Rosen kernel networking\">{{Cite book|title=Linux Kernel Networking: Implementation and Theory| author=Rami Rosen | publisher=Apress | year=2014|isbn=9781430261971|location = New York|oclc=869747983}}</ref>{{rp|210}}\n\n==Motivation and origin==\n\n===IPv4 address exhaustion===\n[[Image:Ipv4 address.svg|right|300px|thumb|Decomposition of the quad-dotted [[IPv4 address]] representation to its binary value]]\n[[IPv4|Internet Protocol Version 4]] (IPv4) was the first publicly used version of the [[Internet Protocol]]. IPv4 was developed as a research project by the [[DARPA|Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency]] (DARPA), a [[United States Department of Defense]] [[government agency|agency]], before becoming the foundation for the [[Internet]] and the [[World Wide Web]]. IPv4 includes an addressing system that uses numerical identifiers consisting of 32 bits. These addresses are typically displayed in [[quad-dotted notation]] as decimal values of four octets, each in the range 0 to 255, or 8 bits per number. Thus, IPv4 provides an addressing capability of 2<sup>32</sup> or approximately 4.3 billion addresses. Address exhaustion was not initially a concern in IPv4 as this version was originally presumed to be a test of DARPA's networking concepts.<ref>{{cite video|title=Google IPv6 Conference 2008: What will the IPv6 Internet look like?|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mZo69JQoLb8|time=13:35}}</ref> During the first decade of operation of the Internet, it became apparent that methods had to be developed to conserve address space. In the early 1990s, even after the redesign of the addressing system using a [[Classless Inter-Domain Routing|classless network]] model, it became clear that this would not suffice to prevent [[IPv4 address exhaustion]], and that further changes to the Internet infrastructure were needed.<ref name=rfc1752>{{cite IETF |title= The Recommendation for the IP Next Generation Protocol|rfc=1752 |first=S.|last=Bradner|first2=A.|last2=Mankin|date=January 1995|publisher=[[Internet Engineering Task Force|IETF]]}}</ref>\n\nThe last unassigned top-level address blocks of 16 million IPv4 addresses were allocated in February 2011 by the [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority]] (IANA) to the five [[regional Internet registry|regional Internet registries]] (RIRs). However, each RIR still has available address pools and is expected to continue with standard address allocation policies until one /8 [[Classless Inter-Domain Routing]] (CIDR) block remains. After that, only blocks of 1024 addresses (/22) will be provided from the RIRs to a [[local Internet registry]] (LIR).

However, most transport and application-layer protocols need little or no change to operate over IPv6; exceptions are application protocols that embed Internet-layer addresses, such as [[File Transfer Protocol]] (FTP) and [[Network Time Protocol]] (NTP), where the new address format may cause conflicts with existing protocol syntax.\n\n===Larger address space===\nThe main advantage of IPv6 over IPv4 is its larger address space. The length of an IPv6 address is 128 bits, compared with 32 bits in IPv4.<ref name=rfc2460/> The address space therefore has 2<sup>128</sup> = 340,282,366,920,938,463,463,374,607,431,768,211,456 addresses (approximately {{val|3.4|e=38}} or 340 billion billion billion billion). As with IPv4, some of these addresses are [[Reserved IP addresses|reserved for special uses]].\n\nIn addition, the IPv4 address space is poorly allocated; in 2011, approximately 14% of all available addresses were utilized.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-30685_3-20030482-264.html|title=Moving to IPv6: Now for the hard part (FAQ)|publisher=CNET News|work=Deep Tech|accessdate=3 February 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110209082433/http://news.cnet.com/8301-30685_3-20030482-264.html|archive-date=9 February 2011}}</ref> While these numbers are large, it was not the intent of the designers of the IPv6 address space to assure geographical saturation{{clarify|date=September 2016}} with usable addresses. Rather, the longer addresses simplify allocation of addresses, enable efficient [[route aggregation]], and allow implementation of special addressing features. In IPv4, complex [[Classless Inter-Domain Routing]] (CIDR) methods were developed to make the best use of the small address space. The standard size of a subnet in IPv6 is 2<sup>64</sup> addresses, more than 4 billion times the size of the entire IPv4 address space. Thus, actual address space utilization rates will be small in IPv6, but network management and routing efficiency are improved by the large subnet space and hierarchical route aggregation.\n\n===Multicasting===\n[[Multicast]]ing, the transmission of a packet to multiple destinations in a single send operation, is part of the base specification in IPv6. In IPv4 this is an optional (although commonly implemented) feature.<ref name=rfc1112>{{IETF RFC|1112}}, ''Host extensions for IP multicasting'', S. Deering (August 1989)</ref> IPv6 multicast addressing has features and protocols in common with IPv4 multicast, but also provides changes and improvements by eliminating the need for certain protocols. IPv6 does not implement traditional [[Broadcast IP address|IP broadcast]], i.e. the transmission of a packet to all hosts on the attached link using a special ''broadcast address'', and therefore does not define broadcast addresses. In IPv6, the same result is achieved by sending a packet to the link-local ''all nodes'' multicast group at address ff02::1, which is analogous to IPv4 multicasting to address 224.0.0.1. IPv6 also provides for new multicast implementations, including embedding rendezvous point addresses in an IPv6 multicast group address, which simplifies the deployment of inter-domain solutions.<ref name=rfc3956>{{IETF RFC|3956}}, ''Embedding the Rendezvous Point (RP) Address in an IPv6 Multicast Address'', P. Savola, B. Haberman (November 2004)</ref>\n\nIn IPv4 it is very difficult for an organization to get even one globally routable multicast group assignment, and the implementation of inter-domain solutions is arcane.<ref>{{IETF RFC|2908}}, ''The Internet Multicast Address Allocation Architecture'', D. Thaler, M. Handley, D. Estrin (September 2000)</ref> Unicast address assignments by a [[local Internet registry]] for IPv6 have at least a 64-bit routing prefix, yielding the smallest subnet size available in IPv6 (also 64 bits). With such an assignment it is possible to embed the unicast address prefix into the IPv6 multicast address format, while still providing a 32-bit block, the least significant bits of the address, or approximately 4.2 billion multicast group identifiers. Thus each user of an IPv6 subnet automatically has available a set of globally routable source-specific multicast groups for multicast applications.<ref>{{IETF RFC|3306}}, ''Unicast-Prefix-based IPv6 Multicast Addresses'', B. Haberman, D. Thaler (August 2002)</ref>\n\n===Stateless address autoconfiguration (SLAAC)===\n{{See also|IPv6 address#Stateless address autoconfiguration|l1=IPv6 address \u00a7 Stateless address autoconfiguration}}\n\nIPv6 hosts configure themselves automatically. Every interface has a self-generated link-local address and, when connected to a network, conflict resolution is performed and routers provide network prefixes via router advertisements.<ref name=rfc4862/> Stateless configuration of routers can be achieved with a special router renumbering protocol.<ref name=rfc2894>{{IETF RFC|2894}}, ''Router Renumbering for IPv6'', M. Crawford, August 2000.</ref> When necessary, hosts may configure additional stateful addresses via [[DHCPv6|Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol version 6]] (DHCPv6) or static addresses manually.\n\nLike IPv4, IPv6 supports globally unique [[IP address]]es. The design of IPv6 intended to re-emphasize the end-to-end principle of network design that was originally conceived during the establishment of the early Internet by rendering [[network address translation]] obsolete. Therefore, every device on the network is globally addressable directly from any other device.\n\nA stable, unique, globally addressable IP address would facilitate tracking a device across networks. Therefore, such addresses are a particular privacy concern for mobile devices, such as laptops and cell phones.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.internetsociety.org/resources/deploy360/2014/privacy-extensions-for-ipv6-slaac/ |title= Privacy Extensions for Stateless Address Autoconfiguration in IPv6 |author=T.

IPsec was a mandatory part of all IPv6 protocol implementations,<ref name=rfc2460/> and [[Internet Key Exchange]] (IKE) was recommended, but with RFC 6434 the inclusion of IPsec in IPv6 implementations was downgraded to a recommendation because it was considered impractical to require full IPsec implementation for all types of devices that may use IPv6. However, as of RFC 4301 IPv6 protocol implementations that do implement IPsec need to implement IKEv2 and need to support a minimum set of [[Cryptography|cryptographic algorithms]]. This requirement will help to make IPsec implementations more interoperable between devices from different vendors. The IPsec Authentication Header (AH) and the Encapsulating Security Payload header (ESP) are implemented as IPv6 extension headers.<ref>{{Cite book |title=IPv6 Essentials: Integrating IPv6 Into Your IPv4 Network |author=Silvia Hagen |publisher=O'Reilly Media |year=2014 |isbn=978-1-4493-3526-7 |page=196 |edition=3rd |location=Sebastopol, CA |oclc=881832733}}</ref>\n\n===Simplified processing by routers===\nThe packet header in IPv6 is simpler than the IPv4 header. Many rarely used fields have been moved to optional header extensions.<ref name=\"History of Domain Names\">{{Cite web|url=http://www.historyofdomainnames.com/ipv6/|title=The History of Domain Names {{!}} IPv6|website=www.historyofdomainnames.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-06-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180612211153/http://www.historyofdomainnames.com/ipv6/|archive-date=12 June 2018}}</ref> With the simplified IPv6 packet header the process of packet forwarding by [[Router (computing)|routers]] has been simplified. Although IPv6 packet headers are at least twice the size of IPv4 packet headers, processing of packets that only contain the base IPv6 header by routers may, in some case, be more efficient, because less processing is required in routers due to the headers being aligned to match common [[Word (computer architecture)|word sizes]].<ref name=rfc2460/><ref name=rfc1726/> However, many devices implement IPv6 support in software (as opposed to hardware), thus resulting in very bad packet processing performance.<ref>{{cite web|title=IPv6 Security Assessment and Benchmarking|first=E.|last=Zack|date=July 2013|url=http://www.ipv6hackers.org/meetings/ipv6-hackers-1}}</ref> Additionally, for many implementations, the use of Extension Headers causes packets to be processed by a router's CPU, leading to poor performance or even security issues.<ref name=draft-gont-v6ops-ipv6-ehs-packet-drops-03>{{cite web|work=draft-gont-v6ops-ipv6-ehs-packet-drops-03|title=Operational Implications of IPv6 Packets with Extension Headers|first=F.|last=Gont|date=March 2016|url=https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-gont-v6ops-ipv6-ehs-packet-drops-03}}</ref>\n\nMoreover, an IPv6 header does not include a checksum. The [[IPv4 header checksum]] is calculated for the IPv4 header, and has to be recalculated by routers every time the [[time to live]] (called [[hop limit]] in the IPv6 protocol) is reduced by one. The absence of a checksum in the IPv6 header furthers the [[end-to-end principle]] of Internet design, which envisioned that most processing in the network occurs in the leaf nodes. Integrity protection for the data that is encapsulated in the IPv6 packet is assumed to be assured by both the [[link layer]] or error detection in higher-layer protocols, namely the [[Transmission Control Protocol]] (TCP) and the [[User Datagram Protocol]] (UDP) on the [[transport layer]]. Thus, while IPv4 allowed UDP datagram headers to have no checksum (indicated by 0 in the header field), IPv6 requires a checksum in UDP headers.\n\nIPv6 routers do not perform [[IP fragmentation]]. IPv6 hosts are required to either perform [[path MTU discovery]], perform end-to-end fragmentation, or to send packets no larger than the default [[Maximum transmission unit]] (MTU), which is 1280 [[octet (computing)|octets]].\n\n===Mobility===\nUnlike mobile IPv4, [[mobile IPv6]] avoids [[triangular routing]] and is therefore as efficient as native IPv6. IPv6 routers may also allow entire subnets to move to a new router connection point without renumbering.<ref name=rfc3963>{{IETF RFC|3963}}, ''Network Mobility (NEMO) Basic Protocol Support'', V. Devarapalli, R. Wakikawa, A. Petrescu, P. Thubert (January 2005)</ref>\n\n===Extension headers===\nThe IPv6 packet header has a minimum size of 40 octets (320 bits). Options are implemented as extensions. This provides the opportunity to extend the protocol in the future without affecting the core packet structure.<ref name=rfc2460/> However, RFC 7872 notes that some network operators drop IPv6 packets with extension headers when they traverse transit [[Autonomous system (Internet)|autonomous systems]].\n\n====Jumbograms====\nIPv4 limits packets to 65,535 (2<sup>16</sup>\u22121) octets of payload. An IPv6 node can optionally handle packets over this limit, referred to as [[jumbogram]]s, which can be as large as 4,294,967,295 (2<sup>32</sup>\u22121) octets. The use of jumbograms may improve performance over high-[[Maximum transmission unit|MTU]] links. The use of jumbograms is indicated by the Jumbo Payload Option extension header.<ref name=rfc2675>{{IETF RFC|2675}}, ''IPv6 Jumbograms'', D. Borman, [[Steve Deering|S. Deering]], R. Hinden (August 1999)</ref>\n\n==IPv6 packets==\n{{Main|IPv6 packet}}\n[[File:Ipv6 header.svg|thumb|IPv6 packet header]]\n\nAn IPv6 packet has two parts: a [[Header (computing)|header]] and [[Payload (computing)|payload]].\n\nThe header consists of a fixed portion with minimal functionality required for all packets and may be followed by optional extensions to implement special features.\n\nThe fixed header occupies the first 40&nbsp;[[octet (computing)|octets]] (320 bits) of the IPv6 packet. It contains the source and destination addresses, traffic classification options, a hop counter, and the type of the optional extension or payload which follows the header. This ''Next Header'' field tells the receiver how to interpret the data which follows the header. If the packet contains options, this field contains the option type of the next option. The \"Next Header\" field of the last option, points to the upper-layer protocol that is carried in the packet's [[payload (computing)|payload]].\n\nExtension headers carry options that are used for special treatment of a packet in the network, e.g., for routing, fragmentation, and for security using the [[IPsec]] framework.\n\nWithout special options, a payload must be less than {{gaps|64|kB}}. With a Jumbo Payload option (in a ''Hop-By-Hop Options'' extension header), the payload must be less than 4&nbsp;GB.\n\nUnlike with IPv4, routers never fragment a packet. Hosts are expected to use [[Path MTU Discovery]] to make their packets small enough to reach the destination without needing to be fragmented. See [[IPv6 packet#Fragmentation|IPv6 packet fragmentation]].\n\n==Addressing==\n[[IPv6 address]]es have 128 bits. The design of the IPv6 address space implements a different design philosophy than in IPv4, in which subnetting was used to improve the efficiency of utilization of the small address space. In IPv6, the address space is deemed large enough for the foreseeable future, and a local area subnet always uses 64 bits for the host portion of the address, designated as the interface identifier, while the most-significant 64 bits are used as the routing prefix.<ref>{{IETF RFC|4291}}, p. 9</ref> While the myth has existed regarding IPv6 subnets being impossible to scan, RFC 7707 notes that patterns resulting from some IPv6 address configuration techniques and algorithms allow for address scanning in many real-world scenarios.\n\n===Address representation===\nThe 128 bits of an IPv6 address are represented in 8 groups of 16 bits each.

IPv6 link-local addresses have the prefix {{IPaddr|fe80::|10}}. This prefix is combined with a 64 bit suffix, which the host can compute and/or assign by itself\u2014without configuration and without the presence or cooperation of an external network component like a DHCP server.\n\nThe lower 64 bits of the link local address (the suffix) were originally derived from the MAC address of the underlying network interface card. As this method of assigning addresses would cause undesirable address changes when faulty network cards were replaced, and as it also suffered from a number of security and privacy issues, RFC 8064 has replaced the original MAC-based method with the hash-based method specified in RFC 7217.\n\n===Address uniqueness and router solicitation===\nIPv6 uses a new mechanism for mapping IP addresses to link layer addresses ([[MAC address]]es), because it does not support the [[Broadcasting (networking)|broadcast]] addressing method, on which the functionality of the [[Address Resolution Protocol]] (ARP) in IPv4 is based. IPv6 implements the [[Neighbor Discovery Protocol]] (NDP, ND) in the [[link layer]], which relies on [[ICMPv6]] and [[multicast]] transmission.<ref name=\"Rosen kernel networking\"/>{{rp|210}} IPv6 hosts verify the uniqueness of their IPv6 addresses in a [[local area network]] (LAN) by sending a neighbor solicitation message asking for the link layer address of the IP address.

The other information consists of one or more prefix information options for the subnets that the host is attached to, a lifetime for the prefix, and two flags:<ref name=\"T. Narten pp. 54\"/>\n** On-link: If this flag is set, the host will treat all addresses on the specific subnet as being on-link, and send packets directly to them instead of sending them to a router for the duration of the given lifetime.\n** Address: This is the flag that tells the host to actually create a global address.\n\n===Global addressing===\nThe assignment procedure for global addresses is similar to local address construction. The prefix is supplied from router advertisements on the network. Multiple prefix announcements cause multiple addresses to be configured.<ref name=\"T.

This permits dual-stack hosts to participate in IPv6 and IPv4 networks simultaneously. The method is defined in {{IETF RFC|4213}}.<ref>{{cite web|rfc=4213|title=Basic Transition Mechanisms for IPv6 Hosts and Routers|publisher=IETF| url =https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4213 |accessdate=2012-08-20}}</ref>\n\nA device with dual-stack implementation in the operating system has an IPv4 and IPv6 address, and can communicate with other nodes in the LAN or the Internet using either IPv4 or IPv6. The [[Domain Name System]] (DNS) protocol is used by both IP protocols to resolve [[fully qualified domain name]]s (FQDN) and IP addresses, but dual stack requires that the resolving DNS server can resolve both types of addresses. Such a dual stack DNS server would hold IPv4 addresses in the A records, and IPv6 addresses in the AAAA records. Depending on the destination that is to be resolved, a DNS name server may return an IPv4 or IPv6 IP address, or both. A default address selection mechanism, or preferred protocol, needs to be configured either on hosts or the DNS server. The [[IETF]] has published [[Happy Eyeballs]] to assist dual stack applications, so that they can connect using both IPv4 and IPv6, but prefer an IPv6 connection if it is available. However, dual-stack also needs to be implemented on all [[Router (computing)|routers]] between the host and the service for which the DNS server has returned an IPv6 address. Dual-stack clients should only be configured to prefer IPv6, if the network is able to forward IPv6 packets using the IPv6 versions of [[routing protocols]]. When dual stack networks protocols are in place the [[application layer]] can be migrated to IPv6.<ref>{{Cite book|title=IPv6 Essentials: Integrating IPv6 Into Your IPv4 Network| author=Silvia Hagen |publisher=O'Reilly Media, Inc. |year=2014|isbn=9781449335267|pages=222}}</ref>\n\nWhile dual-stack is supported by major [[operating system]] and [[network device]] vendors, legacy networking hardware and servers don't support IPv6.\n\n=== ISP customers with public-facing IPv6 ===\n[[File:IPv6 Prefix Assignment Example-en.svg|thumb|500px|IPv6 Prefix Assignment mechanism with IANA, RIRs, and ISPs.]]\n[[Internet service providers]] (ISPs) are increasingly providing their business and private customers with public-facing IPv6 global unicast addresses. However, if in the local area network (LAN) IPv4 is still used, and the ISP can only provide a public facing IPv6, the IPv4 LAN addresses are translated into the public facing IPv6 address using [[NAT64]], a [[network address translation]] (NAT) mechanism. Some ISPs cannot provide their customers with public-facing IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, thus supporting dual stack networking, because some ISPs have exhausted their globally routable IPv4 address pool. Meanwhile, ISP customers are still trying to reach IPv4 [[web servers]] and other destinations.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.juniper.net/documentation/en_US/junos/topics/concept/ipv6-dual-stack-understanding.html |title= Understanding Dual Stacking of IPv4 and IPv6 Unicast Addresses | author=Juniper TechLibrary |date= 31 August 2017 |website= www.juniper.net |access-date= 13 March 2017}}</ref>\n\nA significant percentage of ISPs in all [[regional Internet registry]] (RIR) zones have obtained IPv6 address space.

ISPs report the share of IPv6 traffic from customers over their network to be anything between 20% and 40%, but by mid-2017 IPv6 traffic still only accounted for a fraction of total traffic at several large [[Internet exchange point]]s (IXPs). [[AMS-IX]] reported it to be 2% and [[SeattleIX]] reported 7%. A 2017 survey found that many DSL customers that were served by a dual stack ISP did not request DNS servers to resolve fully qualified domain names into IPv6 addresses. The survey also found that the majority of traffic from IPv6-ready webserver resources were still requested and served over IPv4, mostly due to ISP customers that did not use the dual stack facility provided by their ISP and to a lesser extent due to customers of IPv4-only ISPs.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://blog.apnic.net/2017/06/13/stops-ipv6-traffic-dual-stack-isp/ |title= What stops IPv6 traffic in a dual-stack ISP? | author=  Enric Pujol |date=  2017-06-12|website= www.apnic.net |access-date= 13 Jun 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Tunneling===\nThe technical basis for tunneling, or encapsulating IPv6 packets in IPv4 packets, is outlined in RFC 4213.

Teredo is outlined in RFC 4380 and allows IPv6 [[local area networks]] to tunnel over IPv4 networks, by encapsulating IPv6 packets within UDP. The Teredo relay is an IPv6 router that mediates between a Teredo server and the native IPv6 network. It was expected that 6to4 and Teredo would be widely deployed until ISP networks would switch to native IPv6, but by 2014 Google Statistics showed that the use of both mechanisms had dropped to almost 0.<ref>{{Cite book|title=IPv6 Essentials: Integrating IPv6 Into Your IPv4 Network| author=Silvia Hagen |publisher=O'Reilly Media, Inc. |year=2014|isbn=9781449335267|pages=33}}</ref>\n\n===IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses===\nHybrid dual-stack IPv6/IPv4 implementations recognize a special class of addresses, the IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses.

The Aayis controlled the land from present-day [[Kollam district]] in the north, through [[Thiruvananthapuram district]], all in Kerala, to the [[Kanyakumari district]].

The kingdom was thus also called [[Venad]]. Kings of [[Venad]] had, at various times, travelled from [[Kollam]] and built residential palaces in [[Thiruvithamcode]] and [[Kalkulam]]. Thiruvithamcode became the capital of the Thrippapur Swaroopam, and the country was referred to as ''Thiruvithamcode'' by Europeans even after the capital had been moved in 1601 to [[Padmanabhapuram]], near Kalkulam.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mal.sarva.gov.in/index.php?title=%E0%B4%A4%E0%B4%BF%E0%B4%B0%E0%B5%81%E0%B4%B5%E0%B4%BF%E0%B4%A4%E0%B4%BE%E0%B4%82%E0%B4%95%E0%B5%82%E0%B4%B0%E0%B5%8D%E2%80%8D|archivedate=4 April 2014|accessdate=2014-04-04|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140404133809/http://mal.sarva.gov.in/index.php?title=\u0d24\u0d3f\u0d30\u0d41\u0d35\u0d3f\u0d24\u0d3e\u0d02\u0d15\u0d42\u0d30\u0d4d\u200d|date=2008-07-04|publisher=[[The State Institute of Encyclopaedic Publications]]|title=\u0d24\u0d3f\u0d30\u0d41\u0d35\u0d3f\u0d24\u0d3e\u0d02\u0d15\u0d42\u0d30\u0d4d\u200d|language=Malayalam|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe Chera empire had dissolved by around 1100 and thereafter the territory comprised numerous small kingdoms until the time of [[Marthanda Varma]] who, as king of Venad from 1729, employed brutal methods to unify them.<ref>{{cite book |first=Barbara N. |last=Ramusack |title=The Indian Princes and their States |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2004 |isbn=978-1-13944-908-3 |page=33 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Kz1-mtazYqEC&pg=PA33}}</ref> During his reign, Thiruvithamcode or Travancore became the official name.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\n==Geography==\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\nTravancore 1871.JPG|Map of Travancore in 1871.\nA Canal Scene, Travancore.jpg|A Canal scene in Travancore.\n</gallery>\nThe Kingdom of Travancore was located at the extreme southern tip of the [[Indian subcontinent]].

[[Dharma Raja]]'s period is considered as a Golden Age in the history of Travancore. He not only retained the territorial gains of his predecessor Marthanda Varma, but also improved and encouraged social development. He was greatly assisted by a very efficient administrator, [[Raja Kesavadas]], who was the Diwan of Travancore. {{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nTravancore often allied with the [[English East India Company]] in military conflicts.<ref name=\"Travancore 2011\"/> During [[Dharma Raja]]'s reign, [[Tipu Sultan]], the de facto ruler of [[Mysore]] and the son of [[Hyder Ali]], attacked Travancore in 1789 as a part of the [[Mysore invasion of Kerala]]. Dharma Raja had earlier refused to hand over the [[Hindu]] political refugees from the [[Mysore invasion of Kerala|Mysore occupation of Malabar]], who had been given asylum in Travancore. The Mysore army entered the [[Cochin kingdom]] from [[Coimbatore]] in November 1789 and reached [[Trichur]] in December. On 28 December 1789 Tipu Sultan attacked the Nedunkotta (Northern Lines) from the north, causing the [[Battle of the Nedumkotta (1789)]], resulting in the defeat of Mysore army. In the battle, the bravery of 20 Travancore soldiers is very much appreciable.

A treaty brought Travancore under East India Company protection in 1795.<ref name=\"Travancore 2011\"/>\n\nThe Prime Ministers ([[Dewan|Dalawas]] or [[Dewan]]s) started taking control of the kingdom beginning with [[Velu Thampi Dalawa]] (Velayudhan Chempakaraman Thampi) (1799\u20131809) who was appointed as the ''divan'' following the dismissal of [[Jayanthan Sankaran Nampoothiri]] (1798\u20131799). Initially, Velayudhan Chempakaraman Thampi and the [[English East India Company]] got along very well. When a section of the Travancore army mutinied in 1805 against Velu Thampi Dalawa, he sought refuge with the British Resident and later used [[English East India Company]] troops to crush the mutiny. Velu Thampi also played a key role in renegotiating a new treaty between Travancore and the English East India Company. However, the demands by the East India Company for the payment of compensation for their involvement in the Travancore-Mysore War (1791) on behalf of Travancore, led to tension between the Diwan and the East India Company Resident. Velu Thampi and the [[Diwan (title)|diwan]] of [[Cochin kingdom]], [[Paliath Achan]] Govindan Menon, who was unhappy with the Resident for granting asylum to his enemy Kunhi Krishna Menon, declared \"war\" on the East India Company. {{citation needed|date=May 2014}}\n\n[[File:Adoption Durbar, Trivandrum.jpg|left|thumb|Adoption Durbar, Thiruvananthapuram]]\nThe East India Company army defeated Paliath Achan's army in Cochin on 27 February 1809. Paliath Achan surrendered to the East India Company and was exiled to [[Madras]] and later to [[Benaras]]. The Company defeated forces under Velu Thampi Dalawa at battles near Nagercoil and [[Kollam]] and inflicted heavy casualties on the rebels, following which many of his supporters deserted and went back to their homes. The Maharajah of Travancore, who hitherto had not taken any part in the rebellion openly, now allied with the British and appointed one of Thampi's enemies as his Prime Minister.

The kingdom was thus also called [[Venad]]. Kings of [[Venad]] had, at various times, travelled from [[Kollam]] and built residential palaces in [[Thiruvithamcode]] and [[Kalkulam]].

[[Dharma Raja]]'s period is considered as a Golden Age in the history of Travancore. He not only retained the territorial gains of his predecessor Marthanda Varma, but also improved and encouraged social development. He was greatly assisted by a very efficient administrator, [[Raja Kesavadas]], who was the Diwan of Travancore. {{citation needed|date=June 2015}}\n\nTravancore often allied with the [[English East India Company]] in military conflicts.<ref name=\"Travancore 2011\"/> During [[Dharma Raja]]'s reign, [[Tipu Sultan]], the de facto ruler of [[Mysore]] and the son of [[Hyder Ali]], attacked Travancore in 1789 as a part of the [[Mysore invasion of Kerala]]. Dharma Raja had earlier refused to hand over the [[Hindu]] political refugees from the [[Mysore invasion of Kerala|Mysore occupation of Malabar]], who had been given asylum in Travancore. The Mysore army entered the [[Cochin kingdom]] from [[Coimbatore]] in November 1789 and reached [[Trichur]] in December. On 28 December 1789 Tipu Sultan attacked the Nedunkotta (Northern Lines) from the north, causing the [[Battle of the Nedumkotta (1789)]], resulting in the defeat of Mysore army. In the battle, the bravery of 20 Travancore soldiers is very much appreciable. Tipu lost many soldiers and also one of his commanders in the battle. {{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\n===Velu Thampi Dalawa's rebellion===\n{{Main|Travancore Rebellion}}\nOn [[Dharma Raja]]'s death in 1798, [[Balarama Varma]] (1798\u20131810), the weakest ruler of the dynasty,  took over crown at the age of sixteen. A treaty brought Travancore under East India Company protection in 1795.<ref name=\"Travancore 2011\"/>\n\nThe Prime Ministers ([[Dewan|Dalawas]] or [[Dewan]]s) started taking control of the kingdom beginning with [[Velu Thampi Dalawa]] (Velayudhan Chempakaraman Thampi) (1799\u20131809) who was appointed as the ''divan'' following the dismissal of [[Jayanthan Sankaran Nampoothiri]] (1798\u20131799). Initially, Velayudhan Chempakaraman Thampi and the [[English East India Company]] got along very well. When a section of the Travancore army mutinied in 1805 against Velu Thampi Dalawa, he sought refuge with the British Resident and later used [[English East India Company]] troops to crush the mutiny. Velu Thampi also played a key role in renegotiating a new treaty between Travancore and the English East India Company. However, the demands by the East India Company for the payment of compensation for their involvement in the Travancore-Mysore War (1791) on behalf of Travancore, led to tension between the Diwan and the East India Company Resident. Velu Thampi and the [[Diwan (title)|diwan]] of [[Cochin kingdom]], [[Paliath Achan]] Govindan Menon, who was unhappy with the Resident for granting asylum to his enemy Kunhi Krishna Menon, declared \"war\" on the East India Company. {{citation needed|date=May 2014}}\n\n[[File:Adoption Durbar, Trivandrum.jpg|left|thumb|Adoption Durbar, Trivandrum]]\nThe East India Company army defeated Paliath Achan's army in Cochin on 27 February 1809. Paliath Achan surrendered to the East India Company and was exiled to [[Madras]] and later to [[Benaras]]. The Company defeated forces under Velu Thampi Dalawa at battles near Nagercoil and [[Kollam]] and inflicted heavy casualties on the rebels, following which many of his supporters deserted and went back to their homes. The Maharajah of Travancore, who hitherto had not taken any part in the rebellion openly, now allied with the British and appointed one of Thampi's enemies as his Prime Minister. The allied East India Company army and the Travancore soldiers camped in Pappanamcode, just outside [[Trivandrum]]. Velu Thampi Dalawa now organised a guerrilla struggle against the Company, but committed suicide to avoid capture by the Travancore army. After the mutiny of 1805 against Velu Thampi Dalawa, most of the Nair army battalions of Travancore had been disbanded, and after Velu Thampi Dalawa's uprising, almost all of the remaining Travancore forces were also disbanded, with the East India Company undertaking to serve the king in cases of external and internal aggression. {{citation needed|date=May 2016}}\n\n===Cessation of mah\u0101danams===\nThe kings of Travancore had been conditionally promoted to Kshatryahood with periodic performance of 16 mah\u0101d\u0101nams (great gifts in charity) such as Hiranya-garbh\u0101, Hiranya-K\u0101mdhenu, and Hirany\u0101swarat\u0101 in which each of which thousands of [[Brahmins]] had been given costly gifts apart from each getting a minimum of 1 ''kazhanch'' (78.65&nbsp;gm) of gold.<ref name=\"ASo00\">''A Social History of India''&nbsp;\u2013 (Ashish Publishing House: {{ISBN|81-7648-170-X}} / {{ISBN|81-7648-170-X}}, Jan 2000).</ref> In 1848 the [[James Broun-Ramsay, 1st Marquess of Dalhousie|Marquess of Dalhousie]], then [[Governor-General of India|Governor-General of British India]], was apprised that the depressed condition of the finances in Travancore was due to the mah\u0101danams by the rulers.<ref name=\"Adm88\">Sadasivan, S.N., 1988, ''Administration and social development in Kerala: A study in administrative sociology'', New Delhi, Indian Institute of Public Administration</ref> Lord Dalhousie instructed [[George Harris, 3rd Baron Harris|Lord Harris]], Governor of the [[Madras Presidency]], to warn the then King of Travancore, Martanda Varma (Uttram Tirunal 1847\u201360), that if he did not put a stop to this practice, the Madras Presidency would take over his Kingdom's administration.

The simplicity that the family consistently upheld in all aspects of governance distinguished it from other contemporary monarchies, said Governor of West Bengal M.K. Narayanan\"</ref> The kings of Travancore, unlike their counterparts in the other [[princely states]] of India, spent only a small portion of their state's resources for personal use. This was in sharp contrast with some of the northern Indian kings. Since they spent most of the state's revenue for the benefit of the public, they were naturally much loved by their subjects.<ref>\"Sree Chithira Thirunal, was a noble model of humility, simplicity, piety and total dedication to the welfare of the people. In the late 19th and early 20th century when many native rulers were callously squandering the resources Of their, states, this young Maharaja was able to shine like a solitary star in the firmament, with his royal dignity, transparent sincerity, commendable intelligence and a strong sense of duty.\"-  'A Magna Carta of Religious Freedom'  Speech By His Excellency V.Rachaiya, Governor of Kerala, delivered at Kanakakkunnu Palace on 25.10.1992</ref>\n\nUnlike many British Indian states, violence rooted in religion or caste was rare in Travancore, apart from a few incidents in 1821, 1829, 1858 and 1921. This tolerance of different religions was equally applicable when it came to social and ideological matters. Many political ideologies (such as [[communism]]) and social reforms were welcomed in Travancore. Although the Travancore royal family were devout Hindus, they were tolerant rulers who donated land and material for the construction of Christian churches and Muslim mosques. This patronage was appreciated by local Christians who actively supported the devout Hindu Anizham Thirunal [[Marthanda Varma]] during the Travancore-Dutch battles, against a Christian power.\n\nUnlike in the rest of India, in Travancore (and Kochi), the social status and freedom of women were high. In most communities, the daughters inherited the property (until 1925), were educated, and had the right to divorce and remarry.<ref>{{cite news|last=Santhanam|first=Kausalya|title=Royal vignettes: Travancore - Simplicity graces this House |url=http://www.hindu.com/mag/2003/03/30/stories/2003033000700700.htm|accessdate=14 February 2014|newspaper=[[The Hindu]] (magazine section)|date=March 30, 2003}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n{{col div|colwidth=20em}}\n* [[Travancore Royal Family]]\n* [[Thachudaya Kaimal]] Family\n* [[Travancore\u2013Dutch War]]\n* [[Travancore War]]\n* [[Travancore rupee]]\n* [[Nedumkotta]]\n* [[Cochin - Travancore Alliance (1761)]]\n* [[Cochin Travancore War (1755\u20131756)]]\n* [[Mysore invasion of Kerala]]\n* [[Upper cloth revolt]]\n* [[Vaikom Satyagraha]]\n* [[Temple Entry Proclamation]]\n* ''[[Marthandavarma (novel)|Marthandavarma]]'' (novel)\n* [[The Years of Rice and Salt]], an acclaimed novel that features an alternate history Travancore\n{{colend}}\n\n==References==\n=== Citations ===\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n=== Bibliography ===\n* {{Cite book|first1=V.

He was placed under house arrest with his family by the [[Russian Provisional Government|Provisional Government]], and the family was surrounded by guards and confined to their quarters.<ref>Tames, p. 56.</ref>\n\nIn August 1917, [[Alexander Kerensky]]'s provisional government evacuated the Romanovs to [[Tobolsk]], Siberia, allegedly to protect them from the rising tide of revolution. There they lived in the [[Governor's Mansion (Tobolsk, Russia)|former governor's mansion]] in considerable comfort. After the [[Bolsheviks]] came to power in October 1917, the conditions of their imprisonment grew stricter. Talk in the government of putting Nicholas on trial grew more frequent. Nicholas was forbidden to wear [[epaulette]]s, and the sentries scrawled lewd drawings on the fence to offend his daughters. On 1 March 1918, the family was placed on soldiers' rations. Their 10 servants were dismissed, and they had to give up butter and coffee.<ref>Tames, p. 62.</ref> \n\nAs the [[Bolsheviks]] gathered strength, the government in April moved Nicholas, Alexandra, and their daughter Maria to [[Yekaterinburg]] under the direction of [[Vasily Yakovlev]]. Alexei, who had severe [[haemophilia]], was too ill to accompany his parents and remained with his sisters Olga, Tatiana, and Anastasia, not leaving Tobolsk until May 1918. The family was imprisoned with a few remaining retainers in Yekaterinburg's [[Ipatiev House]], which was designated The House of Special Purpose ({{lang-ru|\u0414\u043e\u043c \u041e\u0441\u043e\u0431\u043e\u0433\u043e \u041d\u0430\u0437\u043d\u0430\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f}}).\n[[File:Grand Duchess Tatiana carrying a litter of dirt during internment at Tsarskoe-Selo 1917.jpg|thumb|Nicholas II, Tatiana and [[Countess Anastasia Hendrikova|Anastasia Hendrikova]] working on a [[kitchen garden]] at Alexander Palace in May 1917.

The senior aides were retained but were designated to guard the hallway area and no longer had access to the Romanovs' rooms; only Yurovsky's men had it. The local Cheka chose replacements from the volunteer battalions of the Verkh-Isetsk factory at Yurovsky's request. He wanted dedicated Bolsheviks who could be relied on to do whatever was asked of them. They were hired on the understanding that they would be prepared, if necessary, to kill the tsar, about which they were sworn to secrecy. Nothing at that stage was said about killing the family or servants. To prevent a repetition of the [[fraternization]] that had occurred under Avdeev, Yurovsky chose mainly foreigners. Nicholas noted in his diary on 8 July that \"new [[Latvians]] are standing guard\", describing them as ''Letts'' \u2013 a term commonly used in Russia to classify someone as of European, non-Russian origin. The leader of the new guards was Adolf Lepa, a [[Lithuanians|Lithuanian]].<ref>Rappaport, pp. 86\u201387.</ref>\n\nThe Romanovs were being held by the Red Army in Yekaterinburg, since the Bolsheviks initially wanted to put them on trial. As the civil war continued and the White Army (a loose alliance of anti-Communist forces) was threatening to capture the city, the fear was that the Romanovs would fall into White hands. This was unacceptable to the Bolsheviks for two reasons: first, the tsar or any of his family members could provide a beacon to rally support to the White cause; second, the tsar, or any of his family members if the tsar were dead, would be considered the legitimate ruler of Russia by the other European nations. This would have given the Whites some power to negotiate for greater foreign intervention on their behalf. Soon after the family was executed, Yekaterinburg fell to the White Army. \n\nIn mid-July 1918, forces of the [[Czechoslovak Legion]] were closing on Yekaterinburg, to protect the [[Trans-Siberian Railway]], of which they had control. According to historian David Bullock, the Bolsheviks, falsely believing that the Czechoslovaks were on a mission to rescue the family, panicked and executed their wards.

He took a Mauser and Colt while Ermakov armed himself with three Nagants, one Mauser and a bayonet; he was the only one assigned to kill two prisoners (Alexandra and Botkin). Yurovsky instructed his men to \"shoot straight at the heart to avoid an excessive quantity of blood and get it over quickly.\"<ref>Montefiore, p. 644.</ref> At least two of the Letts, an [[Austro-Hungarian Army|Austro-Hungarian]] [[prisoner of war]] named Andras Verhas and Adolf Lepa, himself in charge of the Lett contingent, refused to shoot the women.

The Empress and Grand Duchess Olga, according to a guard's reminiscence, had tried to [[Sign of the Cross|bless]] themselves, but failed amid the shooting. Yurovsky reportedly raised his Colt gun at Nicholas's torso and fired; Nicholas fell dead, pierced with at least three bullets in his upper chest. The intoxicated [[Peter Ermakov]], the military commissar for Verkh-Isetsk, shot and killed Alexandra with a bullet wound to the head.

The ''Biographical Chronicle'' of Lenin's political life confirms that first Lenin (between 6 and 7 pm) and then Lenin and Sverdlov together (between 9:30 and 11:50 pm) had direct telegraph contact with the Ural Soviets about Yakovlev's change of route. Despite Yakovlev's request to take the family further away to the more remote Simsky Gorny District in Ufa province (where they could hide in the mountains), warning that \"the baggage\" would be destroyed if given to the Ural Soviets, Lenin and Sverdlov were adamant that they be brought to Yekaterinburg.<ref>Rappaport, p. 139.</ref> On 16 July, the editors of a Danish newspaper queried Lenin to \"kindly wire facts\" in regards to a rumour that Nicholas II \"has been murdered\"; he responded, \"Rumor not true.

He was placed under house arrest with his family by the [[Russian Provisional Government|Provisional Government]], and the family was surrounded by guards and confined to their quarters.<ref>Tames, p. 56.</ref>\n\nIn August 1917, [[Alexander Kerensky]]'s provisional government evacuated the Romanovs to [[Tobolsk]], Siberia, allegedly to protect them from the rising tide of revolution. There they lived in the [[Governor's Mansion (Tobolsk, Russia)|former governor's mansion]] in considerable comfort. After the [[Bolsheviks]] came to power in October 1917, the conditions of their imprisonment grew stricter. Talk in the government of putting Nicholas on trial grew more frequent. Nicholas was forbidden to wear [[epaulette]]s, and the sentries scrawled lewd drawings on the fence to offend his daughters. On 1 March 1918, the family was placed on soldiers' rations. Their 10 servants were dismissed, and they had to give up butter and coffee.<ref>Tames, p. 62.</ref> \n\nAs the [[Bolsheviks]] gathered strength, the government in April moved Nicholas, Alexandra, and their daughter Maria to [[Yekaterinburg]] under the direction of [[Vasily Yakovlev]]. Alexei, who had severe [[haemophilia]], was too ill to accompany his parents and remained with his sisters Olga, Tatiana, and Anastasia, not leaving Tobolsk until May 1918. The family was imprisoned with a few remaining retainers in Yekaterinburg's [[Ipatiev House]], which was designated The House of Special Purpose ({{lang-ru|\u0414\u043e\u043c \u041e\u0441\u043e\u0431\u043e\u0433\u043e \u041d\u0430\u0437\u043d\u0430\u0447\u0435\u043d\u0438\u044f}}).\n[[File:Grand Duchess Tatiana carrying a litter of dirt during internment at Tsarskoe-Selo 1917.jpg|thumb|Nicholas II, Tatiana and [[Countess Anastasia Hendrikova|Anastasia Hendrikova]] working on a [[kitchen garden]] at Alexander Palace in May 1917.

The senior aides were retained but were designated to guard the hallway area and no longer had access to the Romanovs' rooms; only Yurovsky's men had it. The local Cheka chose replacements from the volunteer battalions of the Verkh-Isetsk factory at Yurovsky's request. He wanted dedicated Bolsheviks who could be relied on to do whatever was asked of them. They were hired on the understanding that they would be prepared, if necessary, to kill the tsar, about which they were sworn to secrecy. Nothing at that stage was said about killing the family or servants. To prevent a repetition of the [[fraternization]] that had occurred under Avdeev, Yurovsky chose mainly foreigners. Nicholas noted in his diary on 8 July that \"new [[Latvians]] are standing guard\", describing them as ''Letts'' \u2013 a term commonly used in Russia to classify someone as of European, non-Russian origin. The leader of the new guards was Adolf Lepa, a [[Lithuanians|Lithuanian]].<ref>Rappaport, pp. 86\u201387.</ref>\n\nThe Romanovs were being held by the Red Army in Yekaterinburg, since the Bolsheviks initially wanted to put them on trial. As the civil war continued and the White Army (a loose alliance of anti-Communist forces) was threatening to capture the city, the fear was that the Romanovs would fall into White hands. This was unacceptable to the Bolsheviks for two reasons: first, the tsar or any of his family members could provide a beacon to rally support to the White cause; second, the tsar, or any of his family members if the tsar were dead, would be considered the legitimate ruler of Russia by the other European nations. This would have given the Whites some power to negotiate for greater foreign intervention on their behalf. Soon after the family was executed, Yekaterinburg fell to the White Army. \n\nIn mid-July 1918, forces of the [[Czechoslovak Legion]] were closing on Yekaterinburg, to protect the [[Trans-Siberian Railway]], of which they had control. According to historian David Bullock, the Bolsheviks, falsely believing that the Czechoslovaks were on a mission to rescue the family, panicked and executed their wards.

He took a Mauser and Colt while Ermakov armed himself with three Nagants, one Mauser and a bayonet; he was the only one assigned to kill two prisoners (Alexandra and Botkin). Yurovsky instructed his men to \"shoot straight at the heart to avoid an excessive quantity of blood and get it over quickly.\"<ref>Montefiore, p. 644.</ref> At least two of the Letts, an [[Austro-Hungarian Army|Austro-Hungarian]] [[prisoner of war]] named Andras Verhas and Adolf Lepa, himself in charge of the Lett contingent, refused to shoot the women.

The Empress and Grand Duchess Olga, according to a guard's reminiscence, had tried to [[Sign of the Cross|bless]] themselves, but failed amid the shooting. Yurovsky reportedly raised his Colt gun at Nicholas's torso and fired; Nicholas fell dead, pierced with at least three bullets in his upper chest. The intoxicated [[Peter Ermakov]], the military commissar for Verkh-Isetsk, shot and killed Alexandra with a bullet wound to the head.

The ''Biographical Chronicle'' of Lenin's political life confirms that first Lenin (between 6 and 7 pm) and then Lenin and Sverdlov together (between 9:30 and 11:50 pm) had direct telegraph contact with the Ural Soviets about Yakovlev's change of route. Despite Yakovlev's request to take the family further away to the more remote Simsky Gorny District in Ufa province (where they could hide in the mountains), warning that \"the baggage\" would be destroyed if given to the Ural Soviets, Lenin and Sverdlov were adamant that they be brought to Yekaterinburg.<ref>Rappaport, p. 139.</ref> On 16 July, the editors of a Danish newspaper queried Lenin to \"kindly wire facts\" in regards to a rumour that Nicholas II \"has been murdered\"; he responded, \"Rumor not true.

Veloutaries (Heliotropium foertherianum) and purslane (Portulaca oleracea), with growth shaped by a dominant east winds are present everywhere on the island.\n\nThe fauna consists mainly of hermit crabs (Paguroidea), seabirds and sea turtles for which the island is an important nesting place. The green turtle (Chelonia mydas), also known as the freshwater turtle, is mainly encountered and, to a lesser extent, the tortoiseshell turtle, better known as the caret.\n\nThe waters are rich with fish. The French Coral Reef Initiative (IFRECOR) has identified 26 species of corals. Allochthonous species were introduced on the island during the various shipwrecks: rats, mice and rabbits. The latter were decimated in 1986 by cyclone Erinesta.\n\n===Important Bird Area===\nThe island has been identified as an [[Important Bird Area]] (IBA) by [[BirdLife International]] because of its significance as a [[bird colony|seabird breeding site]].  Both [[masked booby|masked]] (with up to 250 pairs) and [[red-footed booby|red-footed boobies]] (up to 180 pairs) nesting there.  [[Sulidae]] populations have seriously declined in the western Indian Ocean with those on Tromelin among the healthiest remaining.\n\nThe island's masked boobies are of the western Indian Ocean subspecies (''Sula dactylatra melanops''), of which Tromelin is a stronghold.<ref name=\"boobies\">{{cite book|title=African Wildlife|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-59LAQAAIAAJ|year=1974|publisher=Wildlife Society of Southern Africa.}}</ref> The red-footed boobies constitute the only polymorphic population in the region, indicating its biogeographical isolation.  Both [[great frigatebird|great]] and [[lesser frigatebird]]s used to nest on the island. The breeding populations of both birds have since been [[Local extinction|extirpated]], although they continue to use the island for roosting.\n\nThere are no resident landbirds.<ref name=\"bli\">BirdLife International.

After a stopover on the [[Isle de France (Mauritius)|Isle de France]] (present-day Mauritius), the ship embarked 160 Malagasy men, women and children at [[Mahavelona|Foulpointe]], on the east coast of Madagascar, to bring them into slavery on Mauritius, despite the prohibition of trafficking decreed by the governor. A navigation error, due to the use of two conflicting charts, caused the vessel to wreck on the reefs of Tromelin Island (then known as the Isle of Sand). The ship was a frigate, not a slave ship, and thus was not equipped with the shackles and chains usually found on slave ships.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Tromelin, l'\u00eele aux esclaves oubli\u00e9s|last=Gu\u00e9rout, Romon|first=Max, Thomas|publisher=CNRS Editions|year=2015|isbn=|location=France|pages=}}</ref>\n\nAfter the wreck, the crew and about 60 Malagasy people managed to reach the island, but the rest of the slaves, locked in the hold, drowned. The crew retrieved various equipment, food and wood from the wreckage. They dug a well, providing drinking water, and fed on salvaged food, turtles and seabirds.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nCaptain Jean de Lafargue, having lost his mind as a result of the wreck, was replaced by his first lieutenant, second-in-command, Barthelemy Castellan du Vernet who lost his brother Leon in the shipwreck.

When the crew of the ship reached Mauritius, they requested that colonial authorities send a ship to rescue the Malagasy slaves on the island.

A boat was sent, but this first rescue failed, as the ship couldn't approach the island. A year later, a second ship, ''La Sauterelle'', also failed to reach the island. During this second failed rescue, a sailor managed to swim to the island, but he had to be abandoned by the ship due to bad weather. This sailor remained on Tromelin Island and, some time later, probably around 1775, built a raft on which he embarked with three men and three women, but which disappeared at sea.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIt was not until 29 November 1776, 15 years after the sinking, that the [[:fr:Bernard Boudin de Tromelin|Chevalier de Tromelin]], commander of the corvette ''La Dauphine'', reached Tromelin Island and rescued the survivors\u2014seven women and an eight-month-old child.<ref name=\"Marriner-2\">{{cite journal|last=Marriner |first=Nick |last2=Gu\u00e9rout|first2=Max |last3=Romon |first3=Thomas |year=2010 |title=The Forgotten Slaves of Tromelin (Indian Ocean): New Geoarchaeological Data|journal=Journal of Archaeological Science|volume=37|issue=6|pages=1293\u20131304|doi=10.1016/j.jas.2009.12.032}}</ref><ref name=\"independent\" />  Upon arriving there, the Chevalier de Tromelin discovered that the survivors were dressed in plaited feather clothes and that they had managed, during all these years, to keep a fire lit (the island does not have a single tree). The Malagasy people, who had been left on the bleak little island, built a shed with coral stones, for most of the wood had been used in the construction of the raft for the crew. They also built a lookout on the highest point of the island in order not to miss the ship that would, they hoped, come to their rescue. They were all from the [[Central Highlands (Madagascar)|Central Highlands]] of Madagascar, and had no knowledge of how to produce food in the coastal environment. Most had died within the first few months on the island.<ref name=\"LRM\" /> The survivors remained with Jacques Maillart, governor of the Isle de France, who declared them free and offered to bring them back to Madagascar, which they refused.<ref name=\":0\" /> Maillart decided to baptize the child Jacques Moyse (Moses), on the day of his arrival in Port-Louis on 15 December 1776, and to rename his mother Eve (her Malagasy name was Semiavou) and to do the same with the child's grandmother, whom he called Dauphine after the name of the corvette that rescued them.<ref name=\":0\" /> The trio was welcomed in the house of the intendant of the Isle of France. The Chevalier de Tromelin was the first to precisely describe the island that now bears his name.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe [[Marquis de Condorcet]], advocating the abolition of slavery in his book ''Reflections on the Slavery of Negroes'' published in 1781, recounted the tragedy of the castaways of Tromelin to illustrate the inhumanity of the slave trade.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Expedition \"Forgotten slaves\" ===\nAn archeological expedition entitled \"Forgotten Slaves\", led by Max Gu\u00e9rout, a former French naval officer and director of operations of the Naval Archeology Research Group, and Thomas Romon, archaeologist at INRAP (National Institute for Preventive Archaeological Research), took place from October to November 2006, under the patronage of UNESCO and the French Committee for the History and Remembrance of Slavery (CPMHE). The results of the research were made public on January 17, 2007. The ten members of the expedition probed the wreck of L'Utile, and searched the island for traces of shipwreck, in order to better understand the living conditions of the Malagasy people during these fifteen years.<ref name=\":0\" />\nAccording to Max Gu\u00e9rout, head of the mission, \"In three days, a well 5 meters deep was dug. This represented a considerable effort. We found many bones of birds, turtles, and fish.\" One does not have the impression that these people were crushed by their condition. They tried to survive with order and method.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAn anonymous logbook, attributed to a writer of the crew, was found. Basements made of beach sandstone and coral were also found (the survivors thus transgressed a Malagasy custom according to which  stone constructions were reserved for tombs). There were also six copper bowls and a pebble used to sharpen knives. The fire was maintained for fifteen years, thanks to the wood from the wreck, the island being devoid of trees.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nA second expedition, organized in November 2008, did not reveal the burials observed in 1851 by an English naval officer. However, the remains of two bodies displaced during the digging of the foundations of a building of the weather station have been uncovered. Three buildings built with coral blocks have been discovered, including the kitchen, which was still equipped with kitchen utensils, and in particular copper containers that had been repaired several times, testifying to the slaves' determination to survive.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nA third archaeological mission took place in November 2010. It allowed the discovery of three new buildings and many objects, including two lighters and flints, which elucidated the technique used by the castaways to rekindle the fire.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe fourth expedition, took place in September / October 2013.

With the exception of two or three months in summer, this flat island is swept day and night by heavy winds that are sustained in winter. In summer, it can suffer the onslaught of cyclones and tropical storms.\n\nThere is only grass and brush (low shrubs) present on the island. Veloutaries (Heliotropium foertherianum) and purslane (Portulaca oleracea), with growth shaped by a dominant east winds are present everywhere on the island.\n\nThe fauna consists mainly of hermit crabs (Paguroidea), seabirds and sea turtles for which the island is an important nesting place. The green turtle (Chelonia mydas), also known as the freshwater turtle, is mainly encountered and, to a lesser extent, the tortoiseshell turtle, better known as the caret.\n\nThe waters are rich with fish. The French Coral Reef Initiative (IFRECOR) has identified 26 species of corals. Allochthonous species were introduced on the island during the various shipwrecks: rats, mice and rabbits. The latter were decimated in 1986 by cyclone Erinesta.\n\n===Important Bird Area===\nThe island has been identified as an [[Important Bird Area]] (IBA) by [[BirdLife International]] because of its significance as a [[bird colony|seabird breeding site]].  Both [[masked booby|masked]] (with up to 250 pairs) and [[red-footed booby|red-footed boobies]] (up to 180 pairs) nesting there.  [[Sulidae]] populations have seriously declined in the western Indian Ocean with those on Tromelin among the healthiest remaining.\n\nThe island's masked boobies are of the western Indian Ocean subspecies (''Sula dactylatra melanops''), of which Tromelin is a stronghold.<ref name=\"boobies\">{{cite book|title=African Wildlife|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-59LAQAAIAAJ|year=1974|publisher=Wildlife Society of Southern Africa.}}</ref> The red-footed boobies constitute the only polymorphic population in the region, indicating its biogeographical isolation.  Both [[great frigatebird|great]] and [[lesser frigatebird]]s used to nest on the island. The breeding populations of both birds have since been [[Local extinction|extirpated]], although they continue to use the island for roosting.\n\nThere are no resident landbirds.<ref name=\"bli\">BirdLife International.

A navigation error, due to the use of two conflicting charts, caused the vessel to wreck on the reefs of Tromelin Island (then known as the Isle of Sand). The ship was a frigate, not a slave ship, and thus was not equipped with the shackles and chains usually found on slave ships.<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite book|title=Tromelin, l'\u00eele aux esclaves oubli\u00e9s|last=Gu\u00e9rout, Romon|first=Max, Thomas|publisher=CNRS Editions|year=2015|isbn=|location=France|pages=}}</ref>\n\nAfter the wreck, the crew and about 60 Malagasy people managed to reach the island, but the rest of the slaves, locked in the hold, drowned. The crew retrieved various equipment, food and wood from the wreckage. They dug a well, providing drinking water, and fed on salvaged food, turtles and seabirds.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nCaptain Jean de Lafargue, having lost his mind as a result of the wreck, was replaced by his first lieutenant, second-in-command, Barthelemy Castellan du Vernet who lost his brother Leon in the shipwreck.

When the crew of the ship reached Mauritius, they requested that colonial authorities send a ship to rescue the Malagasy slaves on the island. However, they met with a categorical refusal from the governor, with the justification that France was fighting the [[Seven Years' War]] and thus no ship could be spared, the island of Mauritius being itself under threat of attack from [[Company rule in India|British India]].<ref name=\"independent\">{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/africa/shipwrecked-and-abandoned-the-story-of-the-slave-crusoes-435092.html|title=Shipwrecked and abandoned: the story of the slave Crusoes|date=5 February 2007|website=Independent.co.uk|accessdate=26 August 2017}}</ref>\n\nCastellan left the Isle de France to return to France in 1762 and never gave up hope to one day return to the Isle of Sand to save the Malagasy people. The news of the castaway slaves got published and stirred the Parisian intellectual milieu; later, the episode was all but forgotten with the end of the Seven Years' War and the bankruptcy of the East India Company.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIn 1773, a ship passing close to Tromelin Island located the slaves and reported them to the authorities of Isle de France. A boat was sent, but this first rescue failed, as the ship couldn't approach the island. A year later, a second ship, ''La Sauterelle'', also failed to reach the island. During this second failed rescue, a sailor managed to swim to the island, but he had to be abandoned by the ship due to bad weather. This sailor remained on Tromelin Island and, some time later, probably around 1775, built a raft on which he embarked with three men and three women, but which disappeared at sea.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nIt was not until 29 November 1776, 15 years after the sinking, that the [[:fr:Bernard Boudin de Tromelin|Chevalier de Tromelin]], commander of the corvette ''La Dauphine'', reached Tromelin Island and rescued the survivors\u2014seven women and an eight-month-old child.<ref name=\"Marriner-2\">{{cite journal|last=Marriner |first=Nick |last2=Gu\u00e9rout|first2=Max |last3=Romon |first3=Thomas |year=2010 |title=The Forgotten Slaves of Tromelin (Indian Ocean): New Geoarchaeological Data|journal=Journal of Archaeological Science|volume=37|issue=6|pages=1293\u20131304|doi=10.1016/j.jas.2009.12.032}}</ref><ref name=\"independent\" />  Upon arriving there, the Chevalier de Tromelin discovered that the survivors were dressed in plaited feather clothes and that they had managed, during all these years, to keep a fire lit (the island does not have a single tree). The Malagasy people, who had been left on the bleak little island, built a shed with coral stones, for most of the wood had been used in the construction of the raft for the crew. They also built a lookout on the highest point of the island in order not to miss the ship that would, they hoped, come to their rescue. They were all from the [[Central Highlands (Madagascar)|Central Highlands]] of Madagascar, and had no knowledge of how to produce food in the coastal environment. Most had died within the first few months on the island.<ref name=\"LRM\" /> The survivors remained with Jacques Maillart, governor of the Isle de France, who declared them free and offered to bring them back to Madagascar, which they refused.<ref name=\":0\" /> Maillart decided to baptize the child Jacques Moyse (Moses), on the day of his arrival in Port-Louis on 15 December 1776, and to rename his mother Eve (her Malagasy name was Semiavou) and to do the same with the child's grandmother, whom he called Dauphine after the name of the corvette that rescued them.<ref name=\":0\" /> The trio was welcomed in the house of the intendant of the Isle of France. The Chevalier de Tromelin was the first to precisely describe the island that now bears his name.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe [[Marquis de Condorcet]], advocating the abolition of slavery in his book ''Reflections on the Slavery of Negroes'' published in 1781, recounted the tragedy of the castaways of Tromelin to illustrate the inhumanity of the slave trade.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\n=== Expedition \"Forgotten slaves\" ===\nAn archeological expedition entitled \"Forgotten Slaves\", led by Max Gu\u00e9rout, a former French naval officer and director of operations of the Naval Archeology Research Group, and Thomas Romon, archaeologist at INRAP (National Institute for Preventive Archaeological Research), took place from October to November 2006, under the patronage of UNESCO and the French Committee for the History and Remembrance of Slavery (CPMHE). The results of the research were made public on January 17, 2007. The ten members of the expedition probed the wreck of L'Utile, and searched the island for traces of shipwreck, in order to better understand the living conditions of the Malagasy people during these fifteen years.<ref name=\":0\" />\nAccording to Max Gu\u00e9rout, head of the mission, \"In three days, a well 5 meters deep was dug. This represented a considerable effort. We found many bones of birds, turtles, and fish.\" One does not have the impression that these people were crushed by their condition. They tried to survive with order and method.\"<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nAn anonymous logbook, attributed to a writer of the crew, was found. Basements made of beach sandstone and coral were also found (the survivors thus transgressed a Malagasy custom according to which  stone constructions were reserved for tombs). There were also six copper bowls and a pebble used to sharpen knives. The fire was maintained for fifteen years, thanks to the wood from the wreck, the island being devoid of trees.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nA second expedition, organized in November 2008, did not reveal the burials observed in 1851 by an English naval officer. However, the remains of two bodies displaced during the digging of the foundations of a building of the weather station have been uncovered. Three buildings built with coral blocks have been discovered, including the kitchen, which was still equipped with kitchen utensils, and in particular copper containers that had been repaired several times, testifying to the slaves' determination to survive.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nA third archaeological mission took place in November 2010. It allowed the discovery of three new buildings and many objects, including two lighters and flints, which elucidated the technique used by the castaways to rekindle the fire.<ref name=\":0\" />\n\nThe fourth expedition, took place in September / October 2013.

It was established by the [[Treaty of Berlin, 1878|Treaty of Berlin]] in 1878.\n\nAfter the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877\u20131878)|Russo-Turkish War]] ended with a Russian victory, the [[Treaty of San Stefano]] was signed by Russia and the Ottoman Empire on 3 March 1878. Under this, a large Bulgarian vassal state was agreed to, which was significantly larger: its lands encompassed nearly all ethnic Bulgarians in the Balkans,  and included most of [[Moesia]], [[Thrace]] and [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]], stretching from the [[Black Sea]] to the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]]. However, the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Austria-Hungary]] were against the establishment of such a large Russian [[client state]] in the Balkans, fearing it would shift the balance of power in the Mediterranean. Due to this, the [[great power]]s [[Congress of Berlin|convened]] and signed the [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)|Treaty of Berlin]], superseding the Treaty of San Stefano, which never went into effect. This created a much smaller principality, alongside an autonomous [[Eastern Rumelia]] within the Ottoman Empire.\n\nAlthough an Ottoman vassal, Bulgaria only acknowledged the authority of the [[Sublime Porte]] in a formal way.  It had its [[Tarnovo Constitution|own Constitution]], flag and anthem, and conducted its own foreign policy. In 1885, a [[Bulgarian unification|bloodless revolution]] resulted in Eastern Rumelia being de facto annexed by Bulgaria, which the Ottoman Empire accepted with the [[Tophane Agreement]]. On 5 October 1908, Bulgaria [[Bulgarian Declaration of Independence|declared its independence]] as the [[Kingdom of Bulgaria]].\n\n==Background==\nIn 1396 the [[Bulgarian\u2013Ottoman Wars]] ended with the fall of the [[Second Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarian Empire]], due to the Ottoman invasion of the Balkans and its own internal divisions. Under Ottoman rule, the Bulgarian [[nobility]] was destroyed and the national consciousness suppressed. The [[Bulgarian National Revival]], emerging in the late 18th century, revived Bulgarian identity and stoked the idea of creating a new Bulgarian state. Numerous revolutionary movements and uprisings against the Ottomans occurred alongside similar movements in the rest of the Balkans, culminating in the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877-1878)|Russo-Turkish War]] of 1877 to 1878.\n\n==Treaty of Berlin==\n{{main|Treaty of Berlin (1878)}}\n\n[[File:Bulgaria-SanStefano -(1878)-byTodorBozhinov.png|left|thumb|250px|The [[Treaty of San Stefano]] and [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)|Treaty of Berlin]]]]\nThe [[Treaty of San Stefano]] of March 3, 1878 proposed a Bulgarian state, which comprised the geographical regions of [[Moesia]], [[Thrace]] and [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]]. Based on that date [[Bulgarians]] celebrate [[Bulgaria]]'s [[national day]] each year.\n\nFearing the establishment of a large Russian client state on the Balkans, the other great powers, however, were not willing to agree to the treaty. As a result, the [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)|Treaty of Berlin]] (1878), under the supervision of [[Otto von Bismarck]] of [[German Empire|Germany]] and [[Benjamin Disraeli]] of [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]], revised the earlier treaty, and scaled back the proposed Bulgarian state.\n\nA widely autonomous Principality of Bulgaria was created, between the Danube and the [[Stara Planina]] range, with its seat at the old Bulgarian capital of [[Veliko Turnovo]], and including Sofia. This state was to be under nominal Ottoman sovereignty but was to be ruled by a prince elected by a congress of Bulgarian notables and approved by the Powers. They insisted that the Prince could not be a Russian, but in a compromise Prince [[Alexander of Battenberg]], a nephew of Tsar [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]], was chosen. An autonomous Ottoman province under the name of [[Eastern Rumelia]] was created south of the [[Stara Planina]] range, whereas Macedonia was returned under the sovereignty of the Sultan.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\n==19th century==\n{{main|Bulgarian unification}}{{see also|Serbo-Bulgarian War|}}\n\n[[File:Stefan Stambolov by Georgi Danchov Zografina.jpg|left|thumb|150px|[[Stefan Stambolov]]]]\n\nThe Bulgarians adopted an [[Tarnovo Constitution|advanced democratic constitution]], and power soon passed to the Liberal Party led by [[Stefan Stambolov]]. Prince Alexander had conservative leanings, and at first opposed Stambolov's policies, but by 1885 he had become sufficiently sympathetic to his new country to change his mind, and supported the Liberals. He also supported the Unification of Bulgaria and Eastern Rumelia, which was brought about by a coup in Plovdiv in September 1885. The Powers did not intervene because of the power struggles between them. Shortly after, [[Serbo-Bulgarian War|Serbia declared war]] on Bulgaria in the hope of grabbing territory while the Bulgarians were distracted. The Bulgarians defeated them at [[Battle of Slivnitsa|Slivnitsa]], pushed the Serbian army into Serbia and succeeded to re-conquer the seized by the Berlin Treaty Bulgarian populated towns of [[Pirot]] and [[Vranje|Vranya]], but they were given back to Serbia with the [[Treaty of Bucharest (1886)|Treaty of Bucharest in 1886]].\n\nThese events made Alexander very popular in Bulgaria, but Russia was increasingly dissatisfied at the liberal tendencies under his reign. [[1886 Bulgarian coup d'\u00e9tat|In August 1886 they fomented a coup]], in the course of which Alexander was forced to abdicate and was exiled to Russia. Stambolov, however, acted quickly and the participants in the coup were forced to flee the country. Stambolov tried to reinstate Alexander, but strong Russian opposition forced the prince to abdicate again. In July 1887 the Bulgarians elected [[Ferdinand I of Bulgaria|Ferdinand of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha]] as their new Prince. Ferdinand was the \"[[Austria-Hungary|Austrian]] candidate\" and the Russians refused to recognise him. Ferdinand initially worked with Stambolov, but by 1894 their relationship worsened. Stambolov resigned and was assassinated in July 1895. Ferdinand then decided to restore relations with Russia, which meant returning to a conservative policy.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\n==20th century==\nThere was a substantial Bulgarian population still living under Ottoman rule, particularly in Macedonia. To complicate matters, Serbia and Greece too made claims over parts of Macedonia, while Serbia, as a Slavic nation, also considered Macedonians\nas belonging to Serbian nation. Thus began a five-sided struggle for control of these areas which lasted until [[World War I]]. In 1903 there was a Bulgarian insurrection in Ottoman Macedonia and war seemed likely. In 1908 Ferdinand used the struggles between the Great Powers to [[Bulgarian Declaration of Independence|declare Bulgaria a fully independent kingdom]], with himself as Tsar, which he did on 5 October (though celebrated on 22 September, as Bulgaria remained officially on the [[Julian calendar]] until 1916) in the [[Holy Forty Martyrs Church, Veliko Tarnovo]].\n\n===Ilinden-Preobrazhenie Uprising===\n{{main|Ilinden\u2013Preobrazhenie Uprising}}{{see also|Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization|}}\n[[File:Ohrid Banner1.jpg|right|thumb|150px|An [[Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization|IMARO]] banner]]\n\nThe main external political problem confronting Bulgaria throughout the period up to World War I was the fate of Macedonia and Eastern Thrace. At the end of 19th century the [[Internal Macedonian-Adrianople Revolutionary Organization]] was founded and began the preparation of an armed uprising in the regions still occupied by the Ottoman Turks. Relying in part on nationwide support on the part of the Principality of Bulgaria, IMARO got down to organizing a network of committees in Macedonia and Thrace.

It was established by the [[Treaty of Berlin, 1878|Treaty of Berlin]] in 1878.\n\nAfter the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877\u20131878)|Russo-Turkish War]] ended with a Russian victory, the [[Treaty of San Stefano]] was signed by Russia and the Ottoman Empire on 3 March 1878. Under this, a large Bulgarian vassal state was agreed to, which was significantly larger: its lands encompassed nearly all ethnic Bulgarians in the Balkans,  and included most of [[Moesia]], [[Thrace]] and [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]], stretching from the [[Black Sea]] to the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]]. However, the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Austria-Hungary]] were against the establishment of such a large Russian [[client state]] in the Balkans, fearing it would shift the balance of power in the Mediterranean. Due to this, the [[great power]]s [[Congress of Berlin|convened]] and signed the [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)|Treaty of Berlin]], superseding the Treaty of San Stefano, which never went into effect. This created a much smaller principality, alongside an autonomous [[Eastern Rumelia]] within the Ottoman Empire.\n\nAlthough an Ottoman vassal, Bulgaria only acknowledged the authority of the [[Sublime Porte]] in a formal way.  It had its [[Tarnovo Constitution|own Constitution]], flag and anthem, and conducted its own foreign policy. In 1885, a [[Bulgarian unification|bloodless revolution]] resulted in Eastern Rumelia being de facto annexed by Bulgaria, which the Ottoman Empire accepted with the [[Tophane Agreement]]. On 5 October 1908, Bulgaria [[Bulgarian Declaration of Independence|declared its independence]] as the [[Kingdom of Bulgaria]].\n\n==Background==\nIn 1396 the [[Bulgarian\u2013Ottoman Wars]] ended with the fall of the [[Second Bulgarian Empire|Bulgarian Empire]], due to the Ottoman invasion of the Balkans and its own internal divisions. Under Ottoman rule, the Bulgarian [[nobility]] was destroyed and the national consciousness suppressed. The [[Bulgarian National Revival]], emerging in the late 18th century, revived Bulgarian identity and stoked the idea of creating a new Bulgarian state. Numerous revolutionary movements and uprisings against the Ottomans occurred alongside similar movements in the rest of the Balkans, culminating in the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877-1878)|Russo-Turkish War]] of 1877 to 1878.\n\n==Treaty of Berlin==\n{{main|Treaty of Berlin (1878)}}\n\n[[File:Bulgaria-SanStefano -(1878)-byTodorBozhinov.png|left|thumb|250px|The [[Treaty of San Stefano]] and [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)|Treaty of Berlin]]]]\nThe [[Treaty of San Stefano]] of March 3, 1878 proposed a Bulgarian state, which comprised the geographical regions of [[Moesia]], [[Thrace]] and [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]]. Based on that date [[Bulgarians]] celebrate [[Bulgaria]]'s [[national day]] each year.\n\nFearing the establishment of a large Russian client state on the Balkans, the other great powers, however, were not willing to agree to the treaty. As a result, the [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)|Treaty of Berlin]] (1878), under the supervision of [[Otto von Bismarck]] of [[German Empire|Germany]] and [[Benjamin Disraeli]] of [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]], revised the earlier treaty, and scaled back the proposed Bulgarian state.\n\nA widely autonomous Principality of Bulgaria was created, between the Danube and the [[Stara Planina]] range, with its seat at the old Bulgarian capital of [[Veliko Turnovo]], and including Sofia. This state was to be under nominal Ottoman sovereignty but was to be ruled by a prince elected by a congress of Bulgarian notables and approved by the Powers. They insisted that the Prince could not be a Russian, but in a compromise Prince [[Alexander of Battenberg]], a nephew of Tsar [[Alexander II of Russia|Alexander II]], was chosen. An autonomous Ottoman province under the name of [[Eastern Rumelia]] was created south of the [[Stara Planina]] range, whereas Macedonia was returned under the sovereignty of the Sultan.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\n==19th century==\n{{main|Bulgarian unification}}{{see also|Serbo-Bulgarian War|}}\n\n[[File:Stefan Stambolov by Georgi Danchov Zografina.jpg|left|thumb|150px|[[Stefan Stambolov]]]]\n\nThe Bulgarians adopted an [[Tarnovo Constitution|advanced democratic constitution]], and power soon passed to the Liberal Party led by [[Stefan Stambolov]]. Prince Alexander had conservative leanings, and at first opposed Stambolov's policies, but by 1885 he had become sufficiently sympathetic to his new country to change his mind, and supported the Liberals. He also supported the Unification of Bulgaria and Eastern Rumelia, which was brought about by a coup in Plovdiv in September 1885. The Powers did not intervene because of the power struggles between them. Shortly after, [[Serbo-Bulgarian War|Serbia declared war]] on Bulgaria in the hope of grabbing territory while the Bulgarians were distracted. The Bulgarians defeated them at [[Battle of Slivnitsa|Slivnitsa]], pushed the Serbian army into Serbia and succeeded to re-conquer the seized by the Berlin Treaty Bulgarian populated towns of [[Pirot]] and [[Vranje|Vranya]], but they were given back to Serbia with the [[Treaty of Bucharest (1886)|Treaty of Bucharest in 1886]].\n\nThese events made Alexander very popular in Bulgaria, but Russia was increasingly dissatisfied at the liberal tendencies under his reign. [[1886 Bulgarian coup d'\u00e9tat|In August 1886 they fomented a coup]], in the course of which Alexander was forced to abdicate and was exiled to Russia. Stambolov, however, acted quickly and the participants in the coup were forced to flee the country. Stambolov tried to reinstate Alexander, but strong Russian opposition forced the prince to abdicate again. In July 1887 the Bulgarians elected [[Ferdinand I of Bulgaria|Ferdinand of Saxe-Coburg-Gotha]] as their new Prince. Ferdinand was the \"[[Austria-Hungary|Austrian]] candidate\" and the Russians refused to recognise him. Ferdinand initially worked with Stambolov, but by 1894 their relationship worsened. Stambolov resigned and was assassinated in July 1895. Ferdinand then decided to restore relations with Russia, which meant returning to a conservative policy.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}}\n\n==20th century==\nThere was a substantial Bulgarian population still living under Ottoman rule, particularly in Macedonia. To complicate matters, Serbia and Greece too made claims over parts of Macedonia, while Serbia, as a Slavic nation, also considered Macedonians\nas belonging to Serbian nation. Thus began a five-sided struggle for control of these areas which lasted until [[World War I]]. In 1903 there was a Bulgarian insurrection in Ottoman Macedonia and war seemed likely. In 1908 Ferdinand used the struggles between the Great Powers to [[Bulgarian Declaration of Independence|declare Bulgaria a fully independent kingdom]], with himself as Tsar, which he did on 5 October (though celebrated on 22 September, as Bulgaria remained officially on the [[Julian calendar]] until 1916) in the [[Holy Forty Martyrs Church, Veliko Tarnovo]].\n\n===Ilinden-Preobrazhenie Uprising===\n{{main|Ilinden\u2013Preobrazhenie Uprising}}{{see also|Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization|}}\n[[File:Ohrid Banner1.jpg|right|thumb|150px|An [[Internal Macedonian Revolutionary Organization|IMARO]] banner]]\n\nThe main external political problem confronting Bulgaria throughout the period up to World War I was the fate of Macedonia and Eastern Thrace. At the end of 19th century the [[Internal Macedonian-Adrianople Revolutionary Organization]] was founded and began the preparation of an armed uprising in the regions still occupied by the Ottoman Turks. Relying in part on nationwide support on the part of the Principality of Bulgaria, IMARO got down to organizing a network of committees in Macedonia and Thrace. In August 1903 a mass armed uprising, known in history as the Ilinden-Preobrajenie, broke out in Macedonia and Thrace. Its aim was to liberate those regions, or at least to draw the attention of the Great Powers and make them advocate for the improvement of the living conditions for the population through legal and economic reforms. After three months of fierce battles the Ottoman army crushed the uprising using much cruelty against the civilian population.\n\n==List of Princes of Bulgaria==\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n! width=9%  | Portrait\n! width=25% | Name\n! width=9%  | Birth\n! width=9%  | Death\n! width=9%  | From\n! width=9%  | Until\n! width=30% | Notes\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|[[File:Alexander I of Bulgaria by Dimitar Karastoyanov.jpg|80px]]\n|align=\"center\"|[[Alexander of Battenberg|Alexander I]]\n|align=\"center\"|5 April 1857\n|align=\"center\"|23 October 1893\n|align=\"center\"|29 April 1879 \n|align=\"center\"|7 September 1886\n|align=\"center\"|Abdicated\n|-\n|align=\"center\"|[[File:Zar Ferdinand Bulgarien.jpg|80px]]\n|align=\"center\"|[[Ferdinand I of Bulgaria|Ferdinand I]]\n|align=\"center\"|26 February 1861 \n|align=\"center\"|10 September 1948\n|align=\"center\"|29 April 1887 \n|align=\"center\"|5 October 1908\n|align=\"center\"|Became [[King of Bulgaria]] in 1908\n|}\n\n==Gallery==\n<gallery>\nFile:Syedinena Bylgaria - Litografia na N.Pavlovich.JPG|Bulgarian unification of 1885\nFile:Palace of prince Alexander of Bulgaria (engraving).jpg|The [[1886 Bulgarian coup d'\u00e9tat]]\nFile:Portrait of Alexander I von Battenberg.png|Portrait of Prince Alexander\nFile:Bulgarian-Exarchate-1870-1913.jpg|Territory of the [[Bulgarian Exarchate]] from 1870-1913\n\n</gallery>\n\n==See also==\n*[[History of Bulgaria (1878\u20131946)]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.worldstatesmen.org/Bulgaria.html Rulers of Bulgaria] at World Statesmen\n\n{{Bulgaria topics}}\n{{Principalities declared independent and autonomous after the Congress of Berlin}}\n\n{{coord|42|42|N|23|20|E|source:kowiki|display=title}}\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Bulgaria, Principality of}}\n[[Category:States and territories established in 1878]]\n[[Category:States and territories disestablished in 1908]]\n[[Category:1878 establishments in the Ottoman Empire]]\n[[Category:1908 disestablishments in Europe]]\n[[Category:1870s in Bulgaria]]\n[[Category:1880s in Bulgaria]]\n[[Category:1890s in Bulgaria]]\n[[Category:1900s in Bulgaria]]\n", "name_user": "Havsj\u00f6", "label": "safe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principality_of_Bulgaria"}
