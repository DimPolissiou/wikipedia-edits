The player controls [[Pac-Man (character)|Pac-Man]], who must eat all the dots inside an enclosed maze while avoiding four colored ghosts. Eating large flashing dots called power pellets causes the ghosts to turn blue, allowing Pac-Man to eat them for bonus points.\n\nThe development of the game began in early 1979, directed by [[Toru Iwatani]] with a nine-man team. Iwatani wanted to create a game that could appeal to women as well as men, because most video games of the time have themes of war or sports. Although the inspiration for the Pac-Man character was, reportedly, the image of a pizza with a slice removed, Iwatani has said he also rounded out the Japanese symbol \"kuchi\", meaning \"mouth\". The in-game characters were made to be cute and colorful to appeal to younger players. The original Japanese title of ''Puckman'' was derived from the titular character's hockey-puck shape.\n\n''Pac-Man'' was a widespread critical and commercial success, and has an enduring commercial and cultural legacy. The game is important and influential, and it is commonly listed as one of the [[List of video games considered the best|greatest video games of all time]]. The success of the game led to several [[List of Pac-Man video games|sequels]], merchandise, and two television series, as well as a hit single by [[Buckner & Garcia|Buckner and Garcia]]. The ''Pac-Man'' video game franchise remains one of the highest-grossing and best-selling game series of all time, generating more than $14 billion in revenue ({{as of|2016|lc=yes}}) and $43 million in sales combined. The character of Pac-Man is the mascot and flagship icon of [[Bandai Namco Entertainment]] and has the highest brand awareness of any video game character in North America.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Pac-man.png|thumb|left|In-game screenshot. The four ghosts are at box in the center of the screen; Pac-Man is situated underneath them. To the bottom is the player's life count and the level icon (represented by a cherry), to the top is the player's score.]]\n''Pac-Man'' is a [[maze video game|maze chase]] video game. The player controls [[Pac-Man (character)|the titular character]] through an enclosed maze; the objective of the game is to eat all of the dots placed in the maze while avoiding four colored ghosts \u2014 Blinky (red), Pinky (pink), Inky (cyan), and Clyde (orange) \u2014 that pursue him. When all of the dots are eaten, the player advances to the next level. If Pac-Man makes contact with a ghost, he will lose a life; the game ends when all lives are lost. Each of the four ghosts have their own unique, distinct [[artificial intelligence]] (A.I.), or \"personalities\"; Blinky gives direct chase to Pac-Man, Pinky and Inky try to position themselves in front of Pac-Man, usually by cornering him, and Clyde will switch between chasing Pac-Man and fleeing from him.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/41888021 |title=News Headlines |publisher=Cnbc.com |date=March 3, 2011 |accessdate=May 22, 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121015061417/http://www.cnbc.com/id/41888021 |archivedate=October 15, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/41888021 |title=Five Things You Never Knew About Pac-Man |last=CNBC.com |first=Chris Morris{{!}}Special to |date=2011-03-03 |website=www.cnbc.com |access-date=2019-07-07}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/41888021 |title=Five Things You Never Knew About Pac-Man |last=CNBC.com |first=Chris Morris{{!}}Special to |date=2011-03-03 |website=www.cnbc.com |access-date=2019-07-07}}</ref>\n\nPlaced at the four corners of the maze are large flashing \"energizers\", or \"power pellets\". Eating these will cause the ghosts to turn blue with a dizzied expression and reverse direction. Pac-Man can eat blue ghosts for bonus points; when eaten, their eyes make their way back to the center box in the maze. Eating multiple blue ghosts in succession increases their point value. Blue-colored ghosts will flash white when they are about to turn back into their normal, lethal form. Eating a certain number of dots in a level will cause a bonus item, usually in the form of a fruit, to appear underneath the regeneration box, which can be eaten for bonus points.\n\nThe game increases in difficulty as the player progresses; the ghosts become faster and the power pellets decrease in length, to the point where the ghosts will no longer turn blue and edible. To the sides of the maze are two large \"warp tunnels\", which allow Pac-Man and the ghosts to travel to the opposite side of the screen. Ghosts become slower when entering and exiting these tunnels. Levels are indicated by the fruit icon at the bottom of the screen. In-between levels are short cutscenes featuring Pac-Man and Blinky in humorous, comical situations. The game becomes unplayable at the 256th level due to an [[integer overflow]] that affects the game's memory, rendering this level unbeatable.<ref>{{cite book |title=Cult Fiction |last1=Dwyer |first1=James |last2=Dwyer |first2=Brendan |publisher=Paused Books |year=2014 |isbn=9780992988401 |page=14}}</ref>\n\n==Development==\nAfter acquiring the struggling Japanese division of [[Atari]] in 1976, video game developer [[Namco]] had begun producing their own video games in-house, as opposed to simply licensing them from other developers and distributing them in Japan.<ref name=\"nytimes nakamura\">{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/30/business/pac-man-masaya-nakamura-dead.html?_r=0 |title=Masaya Nakamura, Whose Company Created Pac-Man, Dies at 91 |first=Jonathan |last=Sobel |date=January 30, 2017 |accessdate=January 30, 2017 |work=[[New York Times]]}}</ref><ref name=\"Ultimate History\"/> Company president [[Masaya Nakamura (businessman)|Masaya Nakamura]] created a small video game development group within the company and ordered them to study several [[NEC]]-produced microcomputers to potentially create new games with.<ref name=\"AAN\">{{cite book |author1=Microcomputer BASIC Editorial Department |title=All About Namco |date=December 1986 |publisher=Dempa Shimbun |isbn=978-4885541070 |language=Japanese}}</ref><ref name=\"Supercade\">{{cite book |title=Supercade |last=Burnham |first=Van |year=2001 |publisher=MIT Press |location=Cambridge |isbn=0-262-02492-6 |page=181}}</ref> One of the first people assigned to this division was a young 24-year-old employee named [[Toru Iwatani]].<ref name=\"Programmers At Work\"/> He created Namco's first video game ''[[Gee Bee (video game)|Gee Bee]]'' in 1978, which while unsuccessful helped the company gain a stronger foothold in the quickly-growing video game industry.<ref name=\"4Gamer\">{{cite web |last1=Kurokawa |first1=Fumio |title=\u30d3\u30c7\u30aa\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u306e\u8a9e\u308a\u90e8\u305f\u3061 \u7b2c4\u90e8\uff1a\u77f3\u6751\u7e41\u4e00\u6c0f\u304c\u8a9e\u308b\u30ca\u30e0\u30b3\u306e\u6b74\u53f2\u3068\u5275\u696d\u8005\u30fb\u4e2d\u6751\u96c5\u54c9\u6c0f\u306e\u9b45\u529b |url=https://www.4gamer.net/games/999/G999905/20180313040/ |language=Japanese |website=[[4Gamer]] |publisher=Aetas |accessdate=2 August 2019 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190801205701/https://www.4gamer.net/games/999/G999905/20180313040/ |archivedate=1 August 2019 |date=17 March 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"Akagi\">{{cite book|last=Masumi|first= Akagi |title=It Started With Pong |publisher=Amusement News Agency |year=2005 |page=183-184}}</ref> He also assisted in the production of two sequels, ''[[Bomb Bee]]'' and ''[[Cutie Q]]'', both released in 1979.<ref>{{cite web |title=Bomb Bee - Videogame by Namco |url=http://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=7179 |website=[[Killer List of Videogames]] |publisher=The International Arcade Museum |accessdate=1 February 2020 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170802063946/http://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=7179 |archivedate=2 August 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Cutie Q - Videogame by Namco |url=https://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=7462 |website=[[Killer List of Videogames]] |publisher=The International Arcade Museum |accessdate=1 February 2020 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171016144809/https://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=7462 |archivedate=16 October 2017}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Toru Iwatani, creator of Pac-Man, at GDC 2011.jpg|thumb|right|Creator [[Toru Iwatani]] at the 2011 [[Game Developers Conference]].]]\nThe Japanese video game industry had surged in popularity with games such as ''[[Space Invaders]]'' and ''[[Breakout (video game)|Breakout]]'', which lead to the market being flooded with similar titles from other manufacturers in an attempt to cash in on the success.<ref name=\"Eurogamer Interview\"/><ref name=\"Iwatani\">{{cite book|last=Iwatani |first=Toru |title=Introduction to Pac-Man's Game Science |publisher=[[Enterbrain]] |year=2005 |page=33}}</ref> Iwatani felt that arcade games only appealed to men for their crude graphics and violence,<ref name=\"Eurogamer Interview\"/> and that arcades in general were seen as seedy environments.<ref name=\"Time\"/> For his next project, Iwatani chose to create a non-violent, cheerful video game that appealed mostly to women,<ref>{{cite book| first=Chris | last=Kohler |year=2005|title=Power-Up: How Japanese Video Games Gave the World an Extra Life|publisher=[[BradyGames]]|pages=51\u201352|isbn=0-7440-0424-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=auMTAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=July 16, 2019}}</ref> as he believed that attracting women and couples into arcades would potentially make them appear to be much-more family friendly in tone.<ref name=\"Eurogamer Interview\"/> Iwatani began thinking of things that women liked to do in their time;

The player controls [[Pac-Man (character)|Pac-Man]], who must eat all the dots inside an enclosed maze while avoiding four colored ghosts. Eating large flashing dots called power pellets causes the ghosts to turn blue, allowing Pac-Man to eat them for bonus points.\n\nThe development of the game began in early 1979, directed by [[Toru Iwatani]] with a nine-man team. Iwatani wanted to create a game that could appeal to women as well as men, because most video games of the time have themes of war or sports. Although the inspiration for the Pac-Man character was, reportedly, the image of a pizza with a slice removed, Iwatani has said he also rounded out the Japanese symbol \"kuchi\", meaning \"mouth\". The in-game characters were made to be cute and colorful to appeal to younger players. The original Japanese title of ''Puckman'' was derived from the titular character's hockey-puck shape.\n\n''Pac-Man'' was a widespread critical and commercial success, and has an enduring commercial and cultural legacy. The game is important and influential, and it is commonly listed as one of the [[List of video games considered the best|greatest video games of all time]]. The success of the game led to several [[List of Pac-Man video games|sequels]], merchandise, and two television series, as well as a hit single by [[Buckner & Garcia|Buckner and Garcia]]. The ''Pac-Man'' video game franchise remains one of the highest-grossing and best-selling game series of all time, generating more than $14 billion in revenue ({{as of|2016|lc=yes}}) and $43 million in sales combined. The character of Pac-Man is the mascot and flagship icon of [[Bandai Namco Entertainment]] and has the highest brand awareness of any video game character in North America.\n\n==Gameplay==\n[[File:Pac-man.png|thumb|left|In-game screenshot. The four ghosts are at box in the center of the screen; Pac-Man is situated underneath them. To the bottom is the player's life count and the level icon (represented by a cherry), to the top is the player's score.]]\n''Pac-Man'' is a [[maze video game|maze chase]] video game. The player controls [[Pac-Man (character)|the titular character]] through an enclosed maze; the objective of the game is to eat all of the dots placed in the maze while avoiding four colored ghosts \u2014 Blinky (red), Pinky (pink), Inky (cyan), and Clyde (orange) \u2014 that pursue him. When all of the dots are eaten, the player advances to the next level. If Pac-Man makes contact with a ghost, he will lose a life; the game ends when all lives are lost. Each of the four ghosts have their own unique, distinct [[artificial intelligence]] (A.I.), or \"personalities\"; Blinky gives direct chase to Pac-Man, Pinky and Inky try to position themselves in front of Pac-Man, usually by cornering him, and Clyde will switch between chasing Pac-Man and fleeing from him.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/41888021 |title=News Headlines |publisher=Cnbc.com |date=March 3, 2011 |accessdate=May 22, 2012 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121015061417/http://www.cnbc.com/id/41888021 |archivedate=October 15, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/41888021 |title=Five Things You Never Knew About Pac-Man |last=CNBC.com |first=Chris Morris{{!}}Special to |date=2011-03-03 |website=www.cnbc.com |access-date=2019-07-07}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/41888021 |title=Five Things You Never Knew About Pac-Man |last=CNBC.com |first=Chris Morris{{!}}Special to |date=2011-03-03 |website=www.cnbc.com |access-date=2019-07-07}}</ref>\n\nPlaced at the four corners of the maze are large flashing \"energizers\", or \"power pellets\". Eating these will cause the ghosts to turn blue with a dizzied expression and reverse direction. Pac-Man can eat blue ghosts for bonus points; when eaten, their eyes make their way back to the center box in the maze. Eating multiple blue ghosts in succession increases their point value. Blue-colored ghosts will flash white when they are about to turn back into their normal, lethal form. Eating a certain number of dots in a level will cause a bonus item, usually in the form of a fruit, to appear underneath the regeneration box, which can be eaten for bonus points.\n\nThe game increases in difficulty as the player progresses; the ghosts become faster and the power pellets decrease in length, to the point where the ghosts will no longer turn blue and edible. To the sides of the maze are two large \"warp tunnels\", which allow Pac-Man and the ghosts to travel to the opposite side of the screen. Ghosts become slower when entering and exiting these tunnels. Levels are indicated by the fruit icon at the bottom of the screen. In-between levels are short cutscenes featuring Pac-Man and Blinky in humorous, comical situations. The game becomes unplayable at the 256th level due to an [[integer overflow]] that affects the game's memory, rendering this level unbeatable.<ref>{{cite book |title=Cult Fiction |last1=Dwyer |first1=James |last2=Dwyer |first2=Brendan |publisher=Paused Books |year=2014 |isbn=9780992988401 |page=14}}</ref>\n\n==Development==\nAfter acquiring the struggling Japanese division of [[Atari]] in 1976, video game developer [[Namco]] had begun producing their own video games in-house, as opposed to simply licensing them from other developers and distributing them in Japan.<ref name=\"nytimes nakamura\">{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/30/business/pac-man-masaya-nakamura-dead.html?_r=0 |title=Masaya Nakamura, Whose Company Created Pac-Man, Dies at 91 |first=Jonathan |last=Sobel |date=January 30, 2017 |accessdate=January 30, 2017 |work=[[New York Times]]}}</ref><ref name=\"Ultimate History\"/> Company president [[Masaya Nakamura (businessman)|Masaya Nakamura]] created a small video game development group within the company and ordered them to study several [[NEC]]-produced microcomputers to potentially create new games with.<ref name=\"AAN\">{{cite book |author1=Microcomputer BASIC Editorial Department |title=All About Namco |date=December 1986 |publisher=Dempa Shimbun |isbn=978-4885541070 |language=Japanese}}</ref><ref name=\"Supercade\">{{cite book |title=Supercade |last=Burnham |first=Van |year=2001 |publisher=MIT Press |location=Cambridge |isbn=0-262-02492-6 |page=181}}</ref> One of the first people assigned to this division was a young 24-year-old employee named [[Toru Iwatani]].<ref name=\"Programmers At Work\"/> He created Namco's first video game ''[[Gee Bee (video game)|Gee Bee]]'' in 1978, which while unsuccessful helped the company gain a stronger foothold in the quickly-growing video game industry.<ref name=\"4Gamer\">{{cite web |last1=Kurokawa |first1=Fumio |title=\u30d3\u30c7\u30aa\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u306e\u8a9e\u308a\u90e8\u305f\u3061 \u7b2c4\u90e8\uff1a\u77f3\u6751\u7e41\u4e00\u6c0f\u304c\u8a9e\u308b\u30ca\u30e0\u30b3\u306e\u6b74\u53f2\u3068\u5275\u696d\u8005\u30fb\u4e2d\u6751\u96c5\u54c9\u6c0f\u306e\u9b45\u529b |url=https://www.4gamer.net/games/999/G999905/20180313040/ |language=Japanese |website=[[4Gamer]] |publisher=Aetas |accessdate=2 August 2019 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20190801205701/https://www.4gamer.net/games/999/G999905/20180313040/ |archivedate=1 August 2019 |date=17 March 2018}}</ref><ref name=\"Akagi\">{{cite book|last=Masumi|first= Akagi |title=It Started With Pong |publisher=Amusement News Agency |year=2005 |page=183-184}}</ref> He also assisted in the production of two sequels, ''[[Bomb Bee]]'' and ''[[Cutie Q]]'', both released in 1979.<ref>{{cite web |title=Bomb Bee - Videogame by Namco |url=http://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=7179 |website=[[Killer List of Videogames]] |publisher=The International Arcade Museum |accessdate=1 February 2020 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170802063946/http://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=7179 |archivedate=2 August 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=Cutie Q - Videogame by Namco |url=https://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=7462 |website=[[Killer List of Videogames]] |publisher=The International Arcade Museum |accessdate=1 February 2020 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171016144809/https://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=7462 |archivedate=16 October 2017}}</ref>\n\n[[File:Toru Iwatani, creator of Pac-Man, at GDC 2011.jpg|thumb|right|Creator [[Toru Iwatani]] at the 2011 [[Game Developers Conference]].]]\nThe Japanese video game industry had surged in popularity with games such as ''[[Space Invaders]]'' and ''[[Breakout (video game)|Breakout]]'', which lead to the market being flooded with similar titles from other manufacturers in an attempt to cash in on the success.<ref name=\"Eurogamer Interview\"/><ref name=\"Iwatani\">{{cite book|last=Iwatani |first=Toru |title=Introduction to Pac-Man's Game Science |publisher=[[Enterbrain]] |year=2005 |page=33}}</ref> Iwatani felt that arcade games only appealed to men for their crude graphics and violence,<ref name=\"Eurogamer Interview\"/> and that arcades in general were seen as seedy environments.<ref name=\"Time\"/> For his next project, Iwatani chose to create a non-violent, cheerful video game that appealed mostly to women,<ref>{{cite book| first=Chris | last=Kohler |year=2005|title=Power-Up: How Japanese Video Games Gave the World an Extra Life|publisher=[[BradyGames]]|pages=51\u201352|isbn=0-7440-0424-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=auMTAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=July 16, 2019}}</ref> as he believed that attracting women and couples into arcades would potentially make them appear to be much-more family friendly in tone.<ref name=\"Eurogamer Interview\"/> Iwatani began thinking of things that women liked to do in their time;

Edition specific things should be in the edition specific sections below. -->\nThe game board is set in Lovecraft's fictional [[Massachusetts]] town of [[Arkham]] in 1926. Street, building and outdoor locations are featured. Gates to other [[Parallel universe (fiction)|planes]] open throughout the town (represented by tokens placed on the board.)  Players take on the role of investigators, represented by a character card. Each investigator has several attributes (such as \"sanity\"), and cards representing items, spells, and other things. The investigators travel through the city, avoiding or fighting the monsters that enter through the gates, visiting city locations to acquire tools, and ultimately entering the gates.  After traveling to the other world and returning, the investigator can try to close the gate.  While exploring city locations or other worlds, the investigators face random events which may benefit or harm them.  As gates open, a \"Doom Track\" advances; if the track reaches its end, a powerful horrific creature known as the Ancient One breaks through into Arkham.  In the 1987 edition of the game, this ends the game, and all players lose.  In the second edition, when the doom track fills, this typically begins a final opportunity for the players to directly defeat the creature and win; otherwise they lose.\n\n==History==\n''Arkham Horror'' was originally submitted to Chaosium Inc. by Richard Launius as ''Call of Cthulhu: The Board Game'', a new strategic game based on their [[Call of Cthulhu (role-playing game)|''Call of Cthulhu'' role-playing game]].

The game underwent several revisions in this process. Skotos reorganized many of the elements in the game for improved cohesion and arranged for it to more carefully follow the maps of Arkham created by Chaosium and used in their own ''[[Lovecraft Country: Arkham by Night]]'' online game. Launius added several new elements, including clue tokens and some rearrangements to the decks of cards. Finally, [[Kevin Wilson (game designer)|Kevin Wilson]] at Fantasy Flight massively revamped the game, throwing out a [[roll-and-move]] system as well as other concepts and also expanding much of the gameplay.

The map of Arkham consists of a set of intertwined routes with a large number of spaces. There are several locations off the routes, such as Miskatonic University or Dark's Carnival, where a player's investigator may have encounters, or where a gate to another world may appear. The other worlds themselves are in a row at the top of the game board. Encounter events in Arkham are determined by rolling a die and consulting a table for that location.\n\nInvestigators usually move a random number of spaces based on the roll of two six-sided dice. The investigator cards are pre-made, with four fixed attributes: Fast Talk, Fight, Knowledge, and Sneak. To successfully use an attribute, the player rolls one six-sided die to get a value equal or below the attribute's value. Paperclips are used to track two numbers that frequently change: Sanity and Strength.\n\nThe turns of the investigators are preceded by the \"Mythos Phase\", where a gate and monsters may appear. Monsters that appear move throughout the town, attacking any investigators they happen upon; seeing some monsters results in a sanity loss. In true Lovecraft fashion, if an investigator in the town loses all Sanity or Strength, they are ignored by the monsters. The collapsed investigator is transported to the Sanitarium or Hospital, as appropriate, for treatment. Such vital losses in the other worlds result in the death of the investigator, and the player must start a new one.\n\nFor each new gate that opens, the Doom Counter increases by one; the \"Doom of Arkham\" occurs if the Doom Counter reaches 14. If this happens, all players lose.\n\nVictory is achieved by closing all of the gates that have opened. Closing a gate requires passing into it to another world, and taking two encounters there; upon return to Arkham, the investigator must attack the gate successfully to close it. Closing a gate reduces the Doom Counter by one.\n\n===Reception===\nIn the April 1991 edition of ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]'' (Issue 168), [[Ken Rolston]] called the game his \"first choice for a board game with [fantasy role-playing game] feel. It has everything I want in this respect.\" Rolston was saddened that Chaosium had just discontinued production, saying, \"If you see a copy of this gem, buy it. Period.\"<ref name=dragon168 />\n\n{{clear}}<!-- This ensures that the 1987 images all display before the 2005 section starts (which would be confusing). -->\n\n==2005 edition==\n===Gameplay===\n[[File:Deskohran\u00ed 2012 - 6749.JPG|thumbnail|A game of ''Arkham Horror'' being played in Prague in 2012]]\nEach player selects an investigator character that is provided with the game. These characters have three pairs of statistics to represent their strengths and weaknesses, and the ability to \"slide\" their current focus on each scale towards either extreme or keep it relatively average. For example, ''Lore'' and ''Luck'' is one pair - if you maximize your character's Lore, you simultaneously minimize his or her Luck. Characters are further defined by a starting inventory and special abilities. Most importantly, each character has the stats of ''Sanity'' and ''Stamina''. These respectively measure the character's mental stability and physical health (i.e. [[hit points]]). The back of each card includes a brief history for the character, in case players wish to add an element of [[roleplaying]] to the game.\n\nEach player's character is placed on the game board at the location specified on their card. They are given any items specified as well as their starting Sanity and Stamina tokens. At this time, the players should also pick which Ancient One they will be attempting to defeat. This is usually done by randomly drawing the Ancient One's card, but can also be selected intentionally if the players choose to do so.\n\nThe basic resolution mechanic is to roll a number of [[Dice|six-sided dice]] equal to the statistic, plus any modifiers. Results of a five or a six on a die is considered a success. Most checks only require a single success, with the general exception of Combat rolls when fighting monsters. For instance, a card may require a Lore -1 roll. If the character has a Lore stat of 4, they would roll three dice and if at least one die lands on a five or six the character has passed the roll (and may gain a benefit), otherwise he or she has failed (and may suffer a consequence).\n\nCharacters may also become Blessed, which allows them to succeed on a four or higher; or Cursed, which means they can only succeed on a roll of six. Throughout the game, characters collect Clue tokens; a Clue token can be spent to get a bonus die during a roll (after the original roll fails to produce enough successes). There are Skill cards that can be acquired, increasing a statistic by one as well as granting an extra bonus die when you spend a Clue token on that particular type of roll.\n\nEach turn, the players move their characters on the board and either have Encounters at a location (by drawing cards specific to that board location) or fight monsters. They may also purchase items at some locations, or take advantage of other special features. For example, characters who spend a turn at Arkham Asylum will regain a point to their sanity score, or they may spend $2 in-game to regain their maximum sanity. Either way, it takes the place of their normal Encounter card draw for that turn.\n\nCharacters who encounter monsters have the option to sneak past them or fight them. Fighting a monster first involves a Sanity check, needing only a single success but losing Sanity tokens indicated on the monster if the roll fails. After that check, the character may cast spells or use weapons to affect the combat. If the monster is not immediately destroyed or removed from the board, they then roll Fight plus any bonuses from weapons, items or spells. Some monsters only require a single success, while others may require several to destroy.\n\nAt the end of each turn, the first player draws a card from the Mythos deck. This causes a gate to another world to open, as well as releasing new monsters onto the board, causing existing monsters to move on the board and often adding a new effect to gameplay. If enough monsters appear on the board, they are recycled, and the terror level of Arkham increases, indicating that Arkham is slowly being completely overrun by monsters. If the terror level rises high enough, stores begin to close and potential allies flee, and the Ancient One will awaken even faster once Arkham becomes completely infested. Weather may make it more difficult to move through the streets or a rumor might require investigators to complete an action in a certain number of turns to prevent even worse effects from happening. After the Mythos card is resolved, play passes clockwise to the next player to start a new turn.\n\nCertain events add tokens to the Ancient One's card, representing how close it is to awakening. Typically, when a new gate opens a token goes onto the Ancient One's card. Gates may be closed by investigators through a die roll. Alternately, a gate may be sealed by spending Clue tokens, or with an [[Elder Sign (Cthulhu Mythos)|Elder Sign]] item. Sealing a gate prevents another gate from opening in that location again, and using an Elder Sign removes a token from the Ancient One.\n\nIf the Ancient One's card reaches a specified number, it awakens and investigators must immediately deal with the threat. Combat against an Ancient One varies, but typically involves making rolls to remove tokens from it, while the Ancient One lowers their stats each turn or takes certain tokens from them. Investigators who lose all of that token type are immediately devoured and removed from the game. If the Ancient One is defeated, the players win; otherwise, the game is over and they have lost.\n\n===Expansions===\nAn expansion entitled ''Curse of the Dark Pharaoh'' was released in June, 2006, with a revised version released in 2011.<ref>{{cite web|title=Arkham Horror: The Curse of the Dark Pharaoh Expansion (Revised Edition)|url=http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgameexpansion/95683/arkham-horror-the-curse-of-the-dark-pharaoh-expans}}</ref> This expansion added many new cards to the game, including items and encounters. The theme was that a travelling museum exhibit from Egypt has arrived in Arkham, bringing with it accursed artifacts and strange happenings. Heavy emphasis is placed on [[Nyarlathotep]], one of Lovecraft's iconic Outer Gods.\n\nThe second expansion entitled ''Dunwich Horror'' was released during [[Gen Con]] 2006. Based on Lovecraft's short story ''[[The Dunwich Horror]]'', it includes a new board that is placed against the original Arkham Horror board. This new board features locations in the town of Dunwich. Investigators may visit Dunwich by travelling through the Train Station in Arkham or using certain vehicle items. In addition, the game includes new Encounter, Mythos and item cards as well as new mechanics, such as the stalking monster movement, and new Great Old Ones. When a character loses their last point of Sanity, they may take a Madness card which imposes restrictions on the character and restores their maximum Sanity, instead of losing half of their items and clues. A similar Injury deck is provided for investigators who reach zero Stamina. Plus, a new monster, the Dunwich Horror itself, is provided as a special monster whose powers vary from combat to combat.\n\nA third expansion, ''The King in Yellow'', was confirmed in October 2006 and released in June 2007. Like ''Curse of the Dark Pharaoh'', it is a card-only expansion, which this time focuses on a mysterious play that is being performed in Arkham. Based on the [[Robert W. Chambers]] story ''[[The King in Yellow]]'', this expansion introduces the mechanic of the Herald&nbsp;\u2014 a special card that permanently alters the game rules.  The first Herald is The King in Yellow himself, which causes the Doom track to increase every time the Terror track does unless you take a permanent penalty. Support for The Dark Pharaoh has since been added on the ''Fantasy Flight Games'' website as a Herald for the ''Curse of the Dark Pharaoh'' expansion. A third Herald has also been added on  the Fantasy Flight Games website for the ''Dunwich Horror'' expansion.\n\nA fourth expansion, ''[[Kingsport (Lovecraft)|Kingsport]] Horror'', was released in June 2008. It is similar to [[Dunwich Horror]] in that it is board-based rather than card-based.  This expansion adds the additional locations of Kingsport, a new game element of Dimensional Rifts, and aquatic monsters that may move to any other \"aquatic\" location instead of following normal routes.  The expansion also includes new Ancient Ones, new Investigators, new Heralds and introduces Guardians which assist the players much the way Heralds hinder them.\n\nA fifth expansion, ''Black Goat of the Woods'', was released at [[Gen Con]] in August 2008. Another cards-only expansion, the set adds another Herald, a new membership similar to the Silver Twilight Lodge, a new element called Corruption, and difficulty cards that allow you to make the game optionally easier or harder.  In addition, the expansion includes additional Mythos, Gate, Encounter, Spell, Skill, and Unique and Common item cards to be incorporated into the original game.\n\nA sixth expansion, ''[[Innsmouth]] Horror'', was announced on the Fantasy Flight Games Website in February 2009 and released in May 2009.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_news.asp?eidn=574 | title =   Innsmouth Horror is now on sale!   | accessdate = 2009-05-28 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090601061237/http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_news.asp?eidn=574| archivedate= 1 June 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref> The third board expansion adds the town of Innsmouth as well as 16 new investigators, 8 new Ancient Ones, and two new Heralds. Also included are new personal stories cards for investigators, monsters, and encounter cards.\n\nA seventh expansion, ''The Lurker at the Threshold'' was announced in February 2010.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.fantasyflightgames.com./edge_news.asp?eidn=1107 | title = Announcing The Lurker at the Threshold - an expansion for Arkham Horror  | accessdate = 2010-02-15 }}</ref> It was released by Fantasy Flight Games in July 2010.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_news.asp?eidn=1484 | title =   Cross the Threshold   3     | accessdate = 2010-07-16 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100719101535/http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_news.asp?eidn=1484| archivedate= 19 July 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref> This is a small expansion, including a new herald sheet along with over 100 location cards, new Mythos, Gate cards, spells, etc. This expansion includes 18 Gate Markers, designed to replace original ones, and introduces new challenges for investigators trying to seal them. In addition new special Relationship cards were included, which describe how the investigator to your left is related to you and grants some benefit. Also, a new mechanic of making pacts with the Lurker itself were introduced.\n\nAn eighth expansion, ''Miskatonic Horror'' was announced in February 2011<ref>{{cite web | url = http://fantasyflightgames.com/edge_news.asp?eidn=1989 | title = Growing the Gathering Darkness Announcing Miskatonic Horror, a unique Arkham Horror expansion | accessdate = 2011-06-10 }}</ref> and released in July 2011.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_news.asp?eidn=2455 | title = Miskatonic Horror, an expansion for Arkham Horror, is now available  | accessdate = 2011-10-23 }}</ref> The eighth expansion adds nearly 450 new cards, including new Skill, Gate, and Mythos cards. This expansion adds mostly to the other Arkham Horror expansions apart from the main game. Also, new player reference sheets as well as a new Institution variant has been added.\n\n===Reception===\nBen Kuchera reviewed the game for ''[[Ars Technica]]'', and noted that in a game with 700 tokens \"brevity is not one of its strengths... A short game is still measured in hours, and learning to play the game smoothly takes some time. Even with seasoned players, simply setting everything up can take a while, and once you begin adding expansions, the amount of space you need to enjoy the game is increased.\" He concluded that this may not be a game for new players, or players not used to complicated rules systems, saying, \"it's a big, long, complicated game. It's only fun if you have a regular group of gaming friends who get don't mind learning something that's not immediately intuitive. But if you have the space, the time, and the friends... it's worth the investment.\"<ref>{{cite web | url =https://web.archive.org/web/20100806190344/http://arstechnica.com/gaming/news/2010/08/arkham-horror-may-not-be-easy-but-it-sure-is-great.ars | title =700 pieces, 5 hours, 1 Elder God: Hands-on with Arkham Horror | last =Kuchera | first =Ben | date =2010-08-05 | website =Ars Technica | access-date =2019-07-10}}</ref>\n\n==2018 edition==\nA third edition of ''Arkham horror'' was released by Fantasy Flight Games on November 1, 2018.<ref>https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/news/2018/11/1/the-end-is-here/</ref> This version incorporates design elements from ''[[Eldritch Horror]]'' and ''[[Arkham Horror: The Card Game]]''.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* Fantasy Flight's [https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/products/arkham-horror-third-edition/ ''Arkham Horror'' webpage]\n* {{bgg|34|1987 edition|15987|2005 edition|257499|2018 edition}}\n* [http://www.arkhamhorrorwiki.com/Main_Page ''Arkham Horror Wiki'']\n\n{{Media based on H.

Characters are further defined by a starting inventory and special abilities. Most importantly, each character has the stats of ''Sanity'' and ''Stamina''. These respectively measure the character's mental stability and physical health (i.e. [[hit points]]). The back of each card includes a brief history for the character, in case players wish to add an element of [[roleplaying]] to the game.\n\nEach player's character is placed on the game board at the location specified on their card. They are given any items specified as well as their starting Sanity and Stamina tokens. At this time, the players should also pick which Ancient One they will be attempting to defeat. This is usually done by randomly drawing the Ancient One's card, but can also be selected intentionally if the players choose to do so.\n\nThe basic resolution mechanic is to roll a number of [[Dice|six-sided dice]] equal to the statistic, plus any modifiers. Results of a five or a six on a die is considered a success. Most checks only require a single success, with the general exception of Combat rolls when fighting monsters. For instance, a card may require a Lore -1 roll. If the character has a Lore stat of 4, they would roll three dice and if at least one die lands on a five or six the character has passed the roll (and may gain a benefit), otherwise he or she has failed (and may suffer a consequence).\n\nCharacters may also become Blessed, which allows them to succeed on a four or higher; or Cursed, which means they can only succeed on a roll of six. Throughout the game, characters collect Clue tokens; a Clue token can be spent to get a bonus die during a roll (after the original roll fails to produce enough successes). There are Skill cards that can be acquired, increasing a statistic by one as well as granting an extra bonus die when you spend a Clue token on that particular type of roll.\n\nEach turn, the players move their characters on the board and either have Encounters at a location (by drawing cards specific to that board location) or fight monsters. They may also purchase items at some locations, or take advantage of other special features. For example, characters who spend a turn at Arkham Asylum will regain a point to their sanity score, or they may spend $2 in-game to regain their maximum sanity. Either way, it takes the place of their normal Encounter card draw for that turn.\n\nCharacters who encounter monsters have the option to sneak past them or fight them. Fighting a monster first involves a Sanity check, needing only a single success but losing Sanity tokens indicated on the monster if the roll fails. After that check, the character may cast spells or use weapons to affect the combat. If the monster is not immediately destroyed or removed from the board, they then roll Fight plus any bonuses from weapons, items or spells. Some monsters only require a single success, while others may require several to destroy.\n\nAt the end of each turn, the first player draws a card from the Mythos deck. This causes a gate to another world to open, as well as releasing new monsters onto the board, causing existing monsters to move on the board and often adding a new effect to gameplay. If enough monsters appear on the board, they are recycled, and the terror level of Arkham increases, indicating that Arkham is slowly being completely overrun by monsters. If the terror level rises high enough, stores begin to close and potential allies flee, and the Ancient One will awaken even faster once Arkham becomes completely infested. Weather may make it more difficult to move through the streets or a rumor might require investigators to complete an action in a certain number of turns to prevent even worse effects from happening. After the Mythos card is resolved, play passes clockwise to the next player to start a new turn.\n\nCertain events add tokens to the Ancient One's card, representing how close it is to awakening. Typically, when a new gate opens a token goes onto the Ancient One's card. Gates may be closed by investigators through a die roll. Alternately, a gate may be sealed by spending Clue tokens, or with an [[Elder Sign (Cthulhu Mythos)|Elder Sign]] item. Sealing a gate prevents another gate from opening in that location again, and using an Elder Sign removes a token from the Ancient One.\n\nIf the Ancient One's card reaches a specified number, it awakens and investigators must immediately deal with the threat. Combat against an Ancient One varies, but typically involves making rolls to remove tokens from it, while the Ancient One lowers their stats each turn or takes certain tokens from them. Investigators who lose all of that token type are immediately devoured and removed from the game. If the Ancient One is defeated, the players win; otherwise, the game is over and they have lost. \n\n===Expansions===\nAn expansion entitled ''Curse of the Dark Pharaoh'' was released in June, 2006, with a revised version released in 2011.<ref>{{cite web|title=Arkham Horror: The Curse of the Dark Pharaoh Expansion (Revised Edition)|url=http://boardgamegeek.com/boardgameexpansion/95683/arkham-horror-the-curse-of-the-dark-pharaoh-expans}}</ref> This expansion added many new cards to the game, including items and encounters. The theme was that a travelling museum exhibit from Egypt has arrived in Arkham, bringing with it accursed artifacts and strange happenings. Heavy emphasis is placed on [[Nyarlathotep]], one of Lovecraft's iconic Outer Gods.\n\nThe second expansion entitled ''Dunwich Horror'' was released during [[Gen Con]] 2006. Based on Lovecraft's short story ''[[The Dunwich Horror]]'', it includes a new board that is placed against the original Arkham Horror board. This new board features locations in the town of Dunwich. Investigators may visit Dunwich by travelling through the Train Station in Arkham or using certain vehicle items. In addition, the game includes new Encounter, Mythos and item cards as well as new mechanics, such as the stalking monster movement, and new Great Old Ones. When a character loses their last point of Sanity, they may take a Madness card which imposes restrictions on the character and restores their maximum Sanity, instead of losing half of their items and clues. A similar Injury deck is provided for investigators who reach zero Stamina. Plus, a new monster, the Dunwich Horror itself, is provided as a special monster whose powers vary from combat to combat.\n\nA third expansion, ''The King in Yellow'', was confirmed in October 2006 and released in June 2007. Like ''Curse of the Dark Pharaoh'', it is a card-only expansion, which this time focuses on a mysterious play that is being performed in Arkham. Based on the [[Robert W. Chambers]] story ''[[The King in Yellow]]'', this expansion introduces the mechanic of the Herald&nbsp;\u2014 a special card that permanently alters the game rules.  The first Herald is The King in Yellow himself, which causes the Doom track to increase every time the Terror track does unless you take a permanent penalty. Support for The Dark Pharaoh has since been added on the ''Fantasy Flight Games'' website as a Herald for the ''Curse of the Dark Pharaoh'' expansion. A third Herald has also been added on  the Fantasy Flight Games website for the ''Dunwich Horror'' expansion.\n\nA fourth expansion, ''[[Kingsport (Lovecraft)|Kingsport]] Horror'', was released in June 2008. It is similar to [[Dunwich Horror]] in that it is board-based rather than card-based.  This expansion adds the additional locations of Kingsport, a new game element of Dimensional Rifts, and aquatic monsters that may move to any other \"aquatic\" location instead of following normal routes.  The expansion also includes new Ancient Ones, new Investigators, new Heralds and introduces Guardians which assist the players much the way Heralds hinder them.\n\nA fifth expansion, ''Black Goat of the Woods'', was released at [[Gen Con]] in August 2008. Another cards-only expansion, the set adds another Herald, a new membership similar to the Silver Twilight Lodge, a new element called Corruption, and difficulty cards that allow you to make the game optionally easier or harder.  In addition, the expansion includes additional Mythos, Gate, Encounter, Spell, Skill, and Unique and Common item cards to be incorporated into the original game.\n\nA sixth expansion, ''[[Innsmouth]] Horror'', was announced on the Fantasy Flight Games Website in February 2009 and released in May 2009.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_news.asp?eidn=574 | title =   Innsmouth Horror is now on sale!   | accessdate = 2009-05-28 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090601061237/http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_news.asp?eidn=574| archivedate= 1 June 2009 | url-status= live}}</ref> The third board expansion adds the town of Innsmouth as well as 16 new investigators, 8 new Ancient Ones, and two new Heralds. Also included are new personal stories cards for investigators, monsters, and encounter cards.\n\nA seventh expansion, ''The Lurker at the Threshold'' was announced in February 2010.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.fantasyflightgames.com./edge_news.asp?eidn=1107 | title = Announcing The Lurker at the Threshold - an expansion for Arkham Horror  | accessdate = 2010-02-15 }}</ref> It was released by Fantasy Flight Games in July 2010.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_news.asp?eidn=1484 | title =   Cross the Threshold   3     | accessdate = 2010-07-16 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100719101535/http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_news.asp?eidn=1484| archivedate= 19 July 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref> This is a small expansion, including a new herald sheet along with over 100 location cards, new Mythos, Gate cards, spells, etc. This expansion includes 18 Gate Markers, designed to replace original ones, and introduces new challenges for investigators trying to seal them. In addition new special Relationship cards were included, which describe how the investigator to your left is related to you and grants some benefit. Also, a new mechanic of making pacts with the Lurker itself were introduced.\n\nAn eighth expansion, ''Miskatonic Horror'' was announced in February 2011<ref>{{cite web | url = http://fantasyflightgames.com/edge_news.asp?eidn=1989 | title = Growing the Gathering Darkness Announcing Miskatonic Horror, a unique Arkham Horror expansion | accessdate = 2011-06-10 }}</ref> and released in July 2011.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.fantasyflightgames.com/edge_news.asp?eidn=2455 | title = Miskatonic Horror, an expansion for Arkham Horror, is now available  | accessdate = 2011-10-23 }}</ref> The eighth expansion adds nearly 450 new cards, including new Skill, Gate, and Mythos cards. This expansion adds mostly to the other Arkham Horror expansions apart from the main game. Also, new player reference sheets as well as a new Institution variant has been added.\n\n===Reception===\nBen Kuchera reviewed the game for ''[[Ars Technica]]'', and noted that in a game with 700 tokens \"brevity is not one of its strengths... A short game is still measured in hours, and learning to play the game smoothly takes some time. Even with seasoned players, simply setting everything up can take a while, and once you begin adding expansions, the amount of space you need to enjoy the game is increased.\" He concluded that this may not be a game for new players, or players not used to complicated rules systems, saying, \"it's a big, long, complicated game. It's only fun if you have a regular group of gaming friends who get don't mind learning something that's not immediately intuitive. But if you have the space, the time, and the friends... it's worth the investment.\"<ref>{{cite web | url =https://web.archive.org/web/20100806190344/http://arstechnica.com/gaming/news/2010/08/arkham-horror-may-not-be-easy-but-it-sure-is-great.ars | title =700 pieces, 5 hours, 1 Elder God: Hands-on with Arkham Horror | last =Kuchera | first =Ben | date =2010-08-05 | website =Ars Technica | access-date =2019-07-10}}</ref>  \n\n==2018 edition==\nA third edition of ''Arkham horror'' was released by Fantasy Flight Games on November 1, 2018.<ref>https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/news/2018/11/1/the-end-is-here/</ref> This version incorporates design elements from ''[[Eldritch Horror]]'' and ''[[Arkham Horror: The Card Game]]''.\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n* Fantasy Flight's [https://www.fantasyflightgames.com/en/products/arkham-horror-third-edition/ ''Arkham Horror'' webpage]\n* {{bgg|34|1987 edition|15987|2005 edition|257499|2018 edition}}\n* [http://www.arkhamhorrorwiki.com/Main_Page ''Arkham Horror Wiki'']\n\n{{Media based on H.

Recent claims for a linkage of haplogroups J2, L, R1a, and R2 with a contemporaneous origin for the majority of the Indian castes\u2019 paternal lineages from outside the South Asia are rejected, although our findings do support a local origin of haplogroups F* and H.

In a major study (2009) using over 500,000 biallelic autosomal markers, Reich hypothesized that the modern South Asian population was the result of admixture between two genetically divergent ancestral populations dating from the post-Holocene era. These two \"reconstructed\" ancient populations he termed \"Ancestral South Indians\" (ASI) and \"Ancestral North Indians\" (ANI). According to Reich: \"ANI ancestry is significantly higher in Indo-European than Dravidian speakers, suggesting that the ancestral ASI may have spoken a Dravidian language before mixing with the ANI.\" While the ANI is genetically close to Middle Easterners, Central Asians and Europeans, the ASI is not closely related to groups outside of the subcontinent. As no \"ASI\" ancient DNA is available, the indigenous [[Andamanese]] [[Onge]] are used as an (imperfect) proxy of ASI, though nevertheless distinct from (according to Reich et al., the Andamanese, though distinct from them, are the closest living population to ASI). According to Reich et al., both ANI and ASI ancestry are found all over the subcontinent (in both northern and southern India) in varying proportions, and that \u201cANI ancestry ranges from 39-71% in India, and is higher in traditionally upper caste and Indo-European speakers.\"<ref name=\"Reich2009\" />\n\nMoorjani et al. 2013 state that the ASI, though not closely related to any living group, are \"related (distantly) to indigenous Andaman Islanders.\" Moorjani et al. also suggest possible gene flow into the Andamanese from a population related to the ASI. The study concluded that \u201calmost all groups speaking Indo-European or Dravidian languages lie along a gradient of varying relatedness to West Eurasians in PCA (referred to as \u201cIndian cline\u201d)\u201d.<ref name=\":1\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Moorjani P, Thangaraj K, Patterson N, Lipson M, Loh PR, Govindaraj P, Berger B, Reich D, Singh L | display-authors = 6 | title = Genetic evidence for recent population mixture in India | journal = American Journal of Human Genetics | volume = 93 | issue = 3 | pages = 422\u201338 | date = September 2013 | pmid = 23932107 | pmc = 3769933 | doi = 10.1016/j.ajhg.2013.07.006 }}</ref>\n\nA 2013 study using the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), shows that the genome of Andamanese people (Onge) is closer to those of other Oceanic Negrito groups than to that of South Asians.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259114532|title=The Andaman Islanders in a Regional Genetic Context: Reexamining the Evidence for an Early Peopling of the Archipelago from South Asia|website=ResearchGate|language=en|access-date=11 June 2019}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Basu et al. 2016, further analysis revealed that the genomic structure of mainland Indian populations is best explained by contributions from four ancestral components.

ANI formed out of a mixture of \"''Indus Periphery''-related groups\" and migrants from the steppe, while ASI was formed out of \"''Indus Periphery''-related groups\" who moved south and mixed further with local hunter-gatherers. The ancestry of the ASI population is suggested to have averaged about 73% from the AASI and 27% from Iranian-related farmers. Narasimhan et al. observe that samples from the Indus periphery group are always mixes of the same two proximal sources of AASI and Iranian agriculturalist-related ancestry; with \"one of the Indus Periphery individuals having ~42% AASI ancestry and the other two individuals having ~14-18% AASI ancestry\" (with the remainder of their ancestry being from the Iranian agriculturalist-related population).{{sfn|Narasimhan et al.|2018|p=15}}\n\nA genetic study by Yelmen et al.

They concluded that modern South Asians are basically a mixture of a native South Asian genetic component and a later-arriving West-Eurasian component (derived from both West Asia and the western Steppes). The authors also argue that the native South Asian genetic component is distinct from the Andamanese, and that the Andamanese are thus an imperfect proxy. The Andamanese component (represented by the Andamanese Onge) was not found in the northern Indian [[Gujarati people|Gujarati]], and thus it is suggested that the South Indian tribal [[Paniya]] people would serve as a better proxy than the Andamanese (Onge) for the \"native South Asian\" component in modern South Asians.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nTwo genetic studies (Shinde et al. 2019 and Narasimhan et al. 2019,) analysing remains from the Indus Valley civilisation (of parts of Bronze Age Northwest India and East Pakistan), found them to have a mixture of ancestry: Shinde et al. found their samples to have about 50-98% of their genome from peoples related to early Iranian farmers, and from 2-50% of their genome from native South Asian hunter-gatherers sharing a common ancestry with the Andamanese, with the Iranian-related ancestry being on average predominant. The samples analyzed by Narasimhan et al. had 45\u201382% Iranian farmer-related ancestry and 11\u201350% AASI (or Andamanese-related hunter-gatherer ancestry). The analysed samples of both studies have little to none of the \"[[Steppe ancestry]]\" component associated with later Indo-European migrations into India.

The perennial concept of people, language, and agriculture arriving to India together through the northwest corridor does not hold up to close scrutiny. Recent claims for a linkage of haplogroups J2, L, R1a, and R2 with a contemporaneous origin for the majority of the Indian castes\u2019 paternal lineages from outside the South Asia are rejected, although our findings do support a local origin of haplogroups F* and H.

In a major study (2009) using over 500,000 biallelic autosomal markers, Reich hypothesized that the modern South Asian population was the result of admixture between two genetically divergent ancestral populations dating from the post-Holocene era. These two \"reconstructed\" ancient populations he termed \"Ancestral South Indians\" (ASI) and \"Ancestral North Indians\" (ANI). According to Reich: \"ANI ancestry is significantly higher in Indo-European than Dravidian speakers, suggesting that the ancestral ASI may have spoken a Dravidian language before mixing with the ANI.\" While the ANI is genetically close to Middle Easterners, Central Asians and Europeans, the ASI is not closely related to groups outside of the subcontinent. As no \"ASI\" ancient DNA is available, the indigenous [[Andamanese]] [[Onge]] are used as an (imperfect) proxy of ASI, though nevertheless distinct from (according to Reich et al., the Andamanese, though distinct from them, are the closest living population to ASI). According to Reich et al., both ANI and ASI ancestry are found all over the subcontinent (in both northern and southern India) in varying proportions, and that \u201cANI ancestry ranges from 39-71% in India, and is higher in traditionally upper caste and Indo-European speakers.\"<ref name=\"Reich2009\" />\n\nMoorjani et al. 2013 state that the ASI, though not closely related to any living group, are \"related (distantly) to indigenous Andaman Islanders.\" Moorjani et al. also suggest possible gene flow into the Andamanese from a population related to the ASI. The study concluded that \u201calmost all groups speaking Indo-European or Dravidian languages lie along a gradient of varying relatedness to West Eurasians in PCA (referred to as \u201cIndian cline\u201d)\u201d.<ref name=\":1\">{{cite journal | vauthors = Moorjani P, Thangaraj K, Patterson N, Lipson M, Loh PR, Govindaraj P, Berger B, Reich D, Singh L | display-authors = 6 | title = Genetic evidence for recent population mixture in India | journal = American Journal of Human Genetics | volume = 93 | issue = 3 | pages = 422\u201338 | date = September 2013 | pmid = 23932107 | pmc = 3769933 | doi = 10.1016/j.ajhg.2013.07.006 }}</ref>\n\nA 2013 study using the single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP), shows that the genome of Andamanese people (Onge) is closer to those of other Oceanic Negrito groups than to that of South Asians.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259114532|title=The Andaman Islanders in a Regional Genetic Context: Reexamining the Evidence for an Early Peopling of the Archipelago from South Asia|website=ResearchGate|language=en|access-date=11 June 2019}}</ref>\n\nAccording to Basu et al. 2016, further analysis revealed that the genomic structure of mainland Indian populations is best explained by contributions from four ancestral components.

ANI formed out of a mixture of \"''Indus Periphery''-related groups\" and migrants from the steppe, while ASI was formed out of \"''Indus Periphery''-related groups\" who moved south and mixed further with local hunter-gatherers. The ancestry of the ASI population is suggested to have averaged about 73% from the AASI and 27% from Iranian-related farmers. Narasimhan et al. observe that samples from the Indus periphery group are always mixes of the same two proximal sources of AASI and Iranian agriculturalist-related ancestry; with \"one of the Indus Periphery individuals having ~42% AASI ancestry and the other two individuals having ~14-18% AASI ancestry\" (with the remainder of their ancestry being from the Iranian agriculturalist-related population).{{sfn|Narasimhan et al.|2018|p=15}}\n\nA genetic study by Yelmen et al.

They concluded that modern South Asians are basically a mixture of a native South Asian genetic component and a later-arriving West-Eurasian component (derived from both West Asia and the western Steppes). The authors also argue that the native South Asian genetic component is distinct from the Andamanese, and that the Andamanese are thus an imperfect proxy. The Andamanese component (represented by the Andamanese Onge) was not found in the northern Indian [[Gujarati people|Gujarati]], and thus it is suggested that the South Indian tribal [[Paniya]] people would serve as a better proxy than the Andamanese (Onge) for the \"native South Asian\" component in modern South Asians.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\nTwo genetic studies (Shinde et al. 2019 and Narasimhan et al. 2019,) analysing remains from the Indus Valley civilisation (of parts of Bronze Age Northwest India and East Pakistan), found them to have a mixture of ancestry: Shinde et al. found their samples to have about 50-98% of their genome from peoples related to early Iranian farmers, and from 2-50% of their genome from native South Asian hunter-gatherers sharing a common ancestry with the Andamanese, with the Iranian-related ancestry being on average predominant. The samples analyzed by Narasimhan et al. had 45\u201382% Iranian farmer-related ancestry and 11\u201350% AASI (or Andamanese-related hunter-gatherer ancestry). The analysed samples of both studies have little to none of the \"[[Steppe ancestry]]\" component associated with later Indo-European migrations into India.

Under Hitler's rule, Germany became a [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian state]] where nearly all aspects of life were controlled by the government. The official name of the state was '''''Deutsches Reich''''' ([[German Reich]]) until 1943 and '''''Gro\u00dfdeutsches Reich''''' (Greater German Reich) from 1943 to 1945. Nazi Germany is also known as the '''Third Reich''' (''Drittes Reich''), meaning \"Third Realm\" or \"Third Empire\", alluding to the Nazis' perception that Nazi Germany was the successor of the earlier [[Holy Roman Empire|Holy Roman]] (800\u20131806) and [[German Empire|German]] (1871\u20131918) empires. The Nazi regime ended after the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] [[Victory in Europe Day|defeated Germany]] in May 1945, [[End of World War II in Europe|ending World War II in Europe]].\n\nHitler was appointed [[Chancellor of Germany]] by the [[President of Germany (1919\u20131945)|President]] of the [[Weimar Republic]], [[Paul von Hindenburg]], on 30 January 1933. The NSDAP then began to eliminate all political opposition and consolidate its power. Hindenburg died on 2 August 1934 and Hitler became dictator of Germany by merging the offices and powers of the Chancellery and Presidency. A national [[1934 German referendum|referendum held 19 August 1934]] confirmed Hitler as sole ''[[F\u00fchrer]]'' (leader) of Germany. All power was centralised in Hitler's person and his word became the highest law. The government was not a coordinated, co-operating body, but a collection of factions struggling for power and Hitler's favour. In the midst of the [[Great Depression]], the Nazis restored economic stability and ended mass unemployment using heavy military spending and a [[mixed economy]]. Using [[deficit spending]], the regime undertook extensive public works, including the construction of ''[[Reichsautobahn|Autobahn]]en'' (motorways). The return to economic stability boosted the regime's popularity.\n\n[[Racism]], especially [[antisemitism]], was a central ideological feature of the regime. The [[Germanic peoples]] were considered by the Nazis to be the [[master race]], the purest branch of the [[Aryan race]]. Discrimination and persecution against [[Jews]] and [[Romani people]] began in earnest after the seizure of power. The first [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camps]] were established in March 1933. Jews and others deemed undesirable were imprisoned, and liberals, socialists, and communists were killed, imprisoned, or exiled. Christian churches and citizens that [[German resistance to Nazism|opposed Hitler's rule]] were oppressed, and many leaders imprisoned. Education focused on [[scientific racism|racial biology]], population policy, and fitness for military service. Career and educational opportunities for women [[Women in Nazi Germany|were curtailed]]. Recreation and tourism were organised via the [[Strength Through Joy]] program, and the [[1936 Summer Olympics]] showcased Germany on the international stage. [[Reich Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda|Propaganda Minister]] [[Joseph Goebbels]] made effective use of film, mass rallies, and Hitler's hypnotic oratory to influence public opinion. The government controlled artistic expression, promoting specific art forms and banning or discouraging others.\n\nThe Nazi regime dominated neighbours through military threats in the years leading up to war. Nazi Germany made increasingly aggressive territorial demands, threatening war if these were not met. It seized [[Federal State of Austria|Austria]] and almost all of [[Second Czechoslovak Republic|Czechoslovakia]] in 1938 and 1939. Germany signed [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact|a non-aggression pact]] with the [[Soviet Union|USSR]], and [[Invasion of Poland|invaded Poland]] on 1 September 1939, launching [[European theatre of World War II|World War II in Europe]]. By early 1941, Germany controlled much of Europe. ''[[Reichskommissariat]]s'' took control of conquered areas and a [[General Government|German administration]] was established in the remainder of Poland. Germany exploited the raw materials and labour of both its occupied territories and its allies. ''[[Einsatzgruppen]]'' paramilitary [[death squad]]s inside the occupied territories conducted mass killings of millions of Jews and [[Holocaust victims|other peoples]] deemed undesirable by the state. Many others were imprisoned, [[Extermination through labour|worked to death]], or murdered in [[Nazi concentration camps]] and [[extermination camp]]s. This [[genocide]] is known as [[the Holocaust]].\n\nWhile the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion]] of the [[Soviet Union]] in 1941 was initially successful, the Soviet resurgence and entry of the [[United States]] into the war meant the ''[[Wehrmacht]]'' (German armed forces) lost the initiative on the Eastern Front in 1943 and by late 1944 had been pushed back to the pre-1939 border. Large-scale aerial bombing of Germany escalated in 1944 and the [[Axis powers]] were driven back in Eastern and Southern Europe. After the [[Normandy landings|Allied invasion of France]], Germany was conquered by the Soviet Union from the east and the [[Allies of World War II|other Allies]] from the west, and capitulated in May 1945. Hitler's refusal to admit defeat led to massive destruction of German infrastructure and additional war-related deaths in the closing months of the war. The victorious Allies initiated a policy of [[denazification]] and put many of the surviving Nazi leadership on trial for war crimes at the [[Nuremberg trials]].\n\n== Name ==\n{{Further|Reich}}\nThe official name of the state was ''Deutsches Reich'' from 1933 to 1943 and ''Gro\u00dfdeutsches Reich'' from 1943 to 1945, while common English terms are \"Nazi Germany\" and \"Third Reich\". The latter, adopted by [[Nazi propaganda]] as ''Drittes Reich'', was first used in ''[[Das Dritte Reich]]'', a 1923 book by [[Arthur Moeller van den Bruck]]. The book counted the [[Holy Roman Empire]] (962\u20131806) as the first [[Reich]] and the [[German Empire]] (1871\u20131918) as the second.{{sfn|Lauryssens|1999|p=102}}\n\n== Background ==\n{{Further|Adolf Hitler's rise to power}}\nGermany was known as the [[Weimar Republic]] during the years 1919 to 1933. It was a [[republic]] with a [[semi-presidential system]]. The Weimar Republic faced numerous problems, including [[Hyperinflation in the Weimar Republic|hyperinflation]], political extremism (including violence from left- and right-wing paramilitaries), contentious relationships with the [[Allies of World War I|Allied victors]] of [[World War I]], and a series of failed attempts at coalition government by divided political parties.{{sfn|Childers|2017|pp=22\u201323, 35, 48, 124\u2013130, 152, 168\u2013169, 203\u2013204, 225\u2013226}} Severe setbacks to the German economy began after World War I ended, partly because of [[World War I reparations|reparations payments]] required under the 1919 [[Treaty of Versailles]]. The government printed money to make the payments and to repay the country's war debt, but the resulting hyperinflation led to inflated prices for consumer goods, economic chaos, and food riots.{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=103\u2013108}} When the government defaulted on their reparations payments in January 1923, French troops [[Occupation of the Ruhr|occupied German industrial areas]] along the [[Ruhr]] and widespread civil unrest followed.{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=186\u2013187}}\n\nThe [[Nazi Party|National Socialist German Workers' Party]] (''Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei'', NSDAP; Nazi Party) was founded in 1920. It was the renamed successor of the [[German Workers' Party]] (DAP) formed one year earlier, and one of several [[Far-right politics|far-right]] political parties then active in Germany.{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=170\u2013171}} The NSDAP party platform included destruction of the Weimar Republic, rejection of the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, radical [[antisemitism]], and anti-[[Bolshevism]].{{sfn|Goldhagen|1996|p=85}} They promised a strong central government, increased ''[[Lebensraum]]'' (\"living space\") for Germanic peoples, formation of a national community based on race, and racial cleansing via the active suppression of [[Jews]], who would be stripped of their citizenship and civil rights.{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=179\u2013180}} The Nazis proposed national and cultural renewal based upon the [[V\u00f6lkisch movement|''V\u00f6lkisch'' movement]].{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=81}} The party, especially its paramilitary organisation ''[[Sturmabteilung]]'' (SA; Storm Detachment; Brownshirts), used physical violence to advance their political position, disrupting the meetings of rival organisations and attacking their members (as well as Jewish people) on the streets.{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=180\u2013181}} Such far-right armed groups were common in [[Bavaria]], and were tolerated by the sympathetic far-right state government of [[Gustav Ritter von Kahr]].{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=181, 189}}\n\nWhen the stock market in the United States [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|crashed on 24 October 1929]], the effect in Germany was dire.{{sfn|Childers|2017|p=103}} Millions were thrown out of work and several major banks collapsed. Hitler and the NSDAP prepared to take advantage of the emergency to gain support for their party. They promised to strengthen the economy and provide jobs.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|pp=136\u2013137}} Many voters decided the NSDAP was capable of restoring order, quelling civil unrest, and improving Germany's international reputation. After the [[German federal election, July 1932|federal election of 1932]], the NSDAP was the largest party in the [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]], holding 230 seats with 37.4 percent of the popular vote.{{sfn|Goldhagen|1996|p=87}}\n\n== History ==\n{{See|History of Germany}}\n[[File:Hitler portrait crop.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Adolf Hitler]] became Germany's head of state, with the title of ''[[F\u00fchrer und Reichskanzler]]'', in 1934.]]\n\n=== Nazi seizure of power ===\n{{Main|Adolf Hitler's rise to power#Seizure of control (1931\u20131933)}}\nAlthough the Nazis won the greatest share of the popular vote in the two Reichstag general elections of 1932, they did not have a majority. Hitler therefore led a short-lived coalition government formed with the [[German National People's Party]].{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=293, 302}} Under pressure from politicians, industrialists, and the business community, President [[Paul von Hindenburg]] appointed Hitler as [[Chancellor of Germany]] on 30 January 1933. This event is known as the ''[[Machtergreifung]]'' (\"seizure of power\").{{sfn|Shirer|1960|pp=183\u2013184}}\n\nOn the night of 27 February 1933, the [[Reichstag fire|Reichstag building was set afire]]. [[Marinus van der Lubbe]], a Dutch communist, was found guilty of starting the blaze. Hitler proclaimed that the arson marked the start of a communist uprising. The [[Reichstag Fire Decree]], imposed on 28 February 1933, rescinded most civil liberties, including rights of assembly and freedom of the press. The decree also allowed the police to detain people indefinitely without charges. The legislation was accompanied by a propaganda campaign that led to public support for the measure. Violent suppression of communists by the SA was undertaken nationwide and 4,000 members of the [[Communist Party of Germany]] were arrested.{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=329\u2013334}}\n\nIn March 1933, the [[Enabling Act of 1933|Enabling Act]], an amendment to the [[Weimar Constitution]], passed in the Reichstag by a vote of 444 to 94.{{sfn|Evans|2003|p=354}} This amendment allowed Hitler and his cabinet to pass laws\u2014even laws that violated the constitution\u2014without the consent of the president or the Reichstag.{{sfn|Evans|2003|p=351}} As the bill required a two-thirds majority to pass, the Nazis used intimidation tactics as well as the provisions of the Reichstag Fire Decree to keep several [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic]] deputies from attending, and the Communists had already been banned.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=196}}{{sfn|Evans|2003|p=336}} On 10 May, the government seized the assets of the Social Democrats, and they were banned on 22 June.{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=358\u2013359}} On 21 June, the SA raided the offices of the German National People's Party \u2013 their former coalition partners \u2013 and they disbanded on 29 June. The remaining major political parties followed suit. On 14 July 1933 Germany became a [[one-party state]] with the passage of a law decreeing the NSDAP to be the sole legal party in Germany. The founding of new parties was also made illegal, and all remaining political parties which had not already been dissolved were banned.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=201}} The Enabling Act would subsequently serve as the legal foundation for the dictatorship the NSDAP established.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=199}} Further elections [[November 1933 German parliamentary election|in November 1933]], [[German election and referendum, 1936|1936]], and [[German election and referendum, 1938|1938]] were Nazi-controlled, with only members of the NSDAP and a small number of independents elected.{{sfn|Evans|2005|pp=109, 637}}\n\n=== Nazification of Germany ===\n{{Main|Gleichschaltung}}\n[[File:Weimar Republic states map.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|While the [[States of the Weimar Republic|traditional German states]] were not formally abolished (excluding [[Free City of L\u00fcbeck|L\u00fcbeck]] [[Greater Hamburg Act|in 1937]]), their constitutional rights and sovereignty were eroded and ultimately ended.

By the end of the war, occupation costs were calculated by the Nazis at 60&nbsp;billion Reichsmarks, with France alone paying 31.5&nbsp;billion. The [[Bank of France]] was forced to provide 4.5&nbsp;billion Reichsmarks in \"credits\" to Germany, while a further 500,000 Reichsmarks were assessed against Vichy France by the Nazis in the form of \"fees\" and other miscellaneous charges. The Nazis exploited other conquered nations in a similar way. After the war, the [[United States Strategic Bombing Survey]] concluded Germany had obtained 104&nbsp;billion Reichsmarks in the form of occupation costs and other wealth transfers from occupied Europe, including two-thirds of the [[gross domestic product]] of Belgium and the Netherlands.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=943}}\n\nNazi plunder included private and public art collections, artefacts, precious metals, books, and personal possessions. Hitler and G\u00f6ring in particular were interested in acquiring looted art treasures from occupied Europe,{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=945}} the former planning to use the stolen art to fill the galleries of the planned ''[[F\u00fchrermuseum]]'' (Leader's Museum),{{sfn|Spotts|2002|pp=377\u2013378}} and the latter for his personal collection. G\u00f6ring, having stripped almost all of occupied Poland of its artworks within six months of Germany's invasion, ultimately grew a collection valued at over 50&nbsp;million Reichsmarks.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=945}} In 1940, the [[Reichsleiter Rosenberg Taskforce]] was established to loot artwork and cultural material from public and private collections, libraries, and museums throughout Europe. France saw the greatest extent of Nazi plunder. Some 26,000 railroad cars of art treasures, furniture, and other looted items were sent to Germany from France.{{sfn|Manvell|2011|pp=283\u2013285}} By January 1941, Rosenberg estimated the looted treasures from France to be valued at over one billion Reichsmarks.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=946}} In addition, soldiers looted or purchased goods such as produce and clothing\u2014items, which were becoming harder to obtain in Germany\u2014for shipment home.{{sfn|Evans|2008|p=334}}\n\nGoods and raw materials were also taken. In France, an estimated {{convert|9000000|t|LT ST}} of [[cereal]]s were seized during the course of the war, including 75 percent of its oats. In addition, 80 percent of the country's oil and 74 percent of its steel production were taken. The valuation of this loot is estimated to be 184.5&nbsp;billion [[franc]]s. In Poland, Nazi plunder of raw materials began even before the German invasion had concluded.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=944}}\n\nFollowing Operation Barbarossa, the Soviet Union was also plundered. In 1943 alone, 9,000,000 tons of cereals, {{convert|2000000|t|LT ST}} of fodder, {{convert|3000000|t|LT ST}} of potatoes, and {{convert|662000|t|LT ST}} of meats were sent back to Germany. During the course of the German occupation, some 12&nbsp;million pigs and 13&nbsp;million sheep were taken. The value of this plunder is estimated at 4&nbsp;billion Reichsmarks. This relatively low number in comparison to the occupied nations of Western Europe can be attributed to the devastating fighting on the Eastern Front.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|pp=943\u2013944}}\n\n== Racial policy and eugenics ==\n===Racism and antisemitism===\n{{Main|Nazism and race|Racial policy of Nazi Germany|Nazi eugenics}}\nRacism and [[antisemitism]] were basic tenets of the NSDAP and the Nazi regime.

This incident provided the pretext for a [[pogrom]] the NSDAP incited against the Jews on 9 November 1938. Members of the SA damaged or destroyed synagogues and Jewish property throughout Germany.

Outside of Germany, the Romani people were regularly used for forced labour, though many were killed. In the Baltic states and the Soviet Union, 30,000 Romani were killed by the SS, the German Army, and ''Einsatzgruppen''. In [[Government of National Salvation|occupied Serbia]], 1,000 to 12,000 Romani were killed, while nearly all 25,000 Romani living in the [[Independent State of Croatia]] were killed.

Scripts were pre-censored.{{sfn|Evans|2005|pp=130\u2013132}}\n\n[[Leni Riefenstahl]]'s ''[[Triumph of the Will]]'' (1935)\u2014documenting the 1934 Nuremberg Rally\u2014and ''[[Olympia (1938 film)|Olympia]]'' (1938)\u2014covering the [[1936 Summer Olympics]]\u2014pioneered techniques of camera movement and editing that influenced later films.

They were charged with four counts\u2014conspiracy to commit crimes, crimes against peace, [[war crime]]s and [[crimes against humanity]]\u2014in violation of international laws governing warfare.{{sfn|Evans|2008|p=741}} All but three of the defendants were found guilty and twelve were sentenced to death.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=1143}} Twelve [[Subsequent Nuremberg trials]] of 184 defendants were held between 1946 and 1949.{{sfn|Evans|2008|p=741}} Between 1946 and 1949, the Allies investigated 3,887 cases, of which 489 were brought to trial. The result was convictions of 1,426 people; 297 of these were sentenced to death and 279 to life in prison, with the remainder receiving lesser sentences. About 65 percent of the death sentences were carried out.{{sfn|Marcuse|2001|p=98}} Poland was more active than other nations in investigating war crimes, for example prosecuting 673 of the total 789 Auschwitz staff brought to trial.{{sfn|Rees|2005|pp=295\u201396}}\n\nThe political programme espoused by Hitler and the NSDAP brought about a world war, leaving behind a devastated and impoverished Europe. Germany itself suffered wholesale destruction, characterised as ''[[Stunde Null]]'' (Zero Hour).{{sfn|Fischer|1995|p=569}} The number of civilians killed during the Second World War was unprecedented in the history of warfare.{{sfn|Murray|Millett|2001|p=554}} As a result, Nazi ideology and the actions taken by the regime are almost universally regarded as gravely immoral.{{sfn|Kershaw|2000a|pp=1\u20136}} Historians, philosophers, and politicians often use the word \"[[evil]]\" to describe Hitler and the Nazi regime.{{sfn|Welch|2001|p=2}} Interest in Nazi Germany continues in the media and the academic world. While Evans remarks that the era \"exerts an almost universal appeal because its murderous racism stands as a warning to the whole of humanity\",{{sfn|Evans|2009|p=56}} young neo-Nazis enjoy the shock value the use Nazi symbols or slogans provides.{{sfn|''The Economist''|2015}} The display or use of [[Nazi symbolism]] such as flags, [[swastika]]s, or greetings is illegal in Germany and Austria.{{sfn|''Strafgesetzbuch'', section 86a}}\n\nThe process of denazification, which was initiated by the Allies as a way to remove Nazi Party members was only partially successful, as the need for experts in such fields as medicine and engineering was too great. However, expression of Nazi views was frowned upon, and those who expressed such views were frequently dismissed from their jobs.{{sfn|Evans|2008|pp=748\u2013749}} From the immediate post-war period through the 1950s, people avoided talking about the Nazi regime or their own wartime experiences. While virtually every family suffered losses during the war has a story to tell, Germans kept quiet about their experiences and felt a sense of communal guilt, even if they were not directly involved in war crimes.{{sfn|Sontheimer|2005}}\n\nThe trial of [[Adolf Eichmann]] in 1961 and the broadcast of the television miniseries ''[[Holocaust (miniseries)|Holocaust]]'' in 1979 brought the process of ''[[Vergangenheitsbew\u00e4ltigung]]'' (coping with the past) to the forefront for many Germans.{{sfn|''The Economist''|2015}}{{sfn|Sontheimer|2005}} Once study of Nazi Germany was introduced into the school [[curriculum]] starting in the 1970s, people began researching the experiences of their family members. Study of the era and a willingness to critically examine its mistakes has led to the development of a strong democracy in Germany, but with lingering undercurrents of antisemitism and [[neo-Nazi]] thought.{{sfn|Sontheimer|2005}}\n\nIn 2017 a [[K\u00f6rber Foundation]] survey found that 40 percent of 14-year-olds in Germany did not know what [[Auschwitz concentration camp|Auschwitz]] was.{{sfn|Goebel|2017}} The journalist [[Alan Posener]] attributed the country's \"growing historical amnesia\" in part to a failure by the German film and television industry to reflect the country's history accurately.{{sfn|Posener|2018}}\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Germany|World War II}}\n{{div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[Collaboration with the Axis Powers]]\n* [[Glossary of Nazi Germany]]\n* [[List of books about Nazi Germany]]\n* [[List of books by or about Adolf Hitler]]\n* [[List of Nazi Party leaders and officials]]\n* [[Nazi songs]]\n* [[Orders, decorations, and medals of Nazi Germany]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n== References ==\n=== Explanatory notes ===\n{{notes\n| notes =\n{{efn\n| name = Wessel\n| On 12 July 1933, ''Reichsinnenminister'' [[Wilhelm Frick]], the Interior Minister, ordered that the ''Horst-Wessel-Lied'' be played right after the standing national anthem ''[[Das Lied der Deutschen]]'', better known as ''Deutschland \u00dcber Alles''.{{harvnb|T\u00fcmmler|2010|p=63}}.\n}}\n{{efn\n| name = annexed\n| Including ''de facto'' [[Areas annexed by Nazi Germany|annexed and incorporated territories]].\n}}\n{{efn\n| name = statistics\n| In 1939, before Germany acquired control of the last two regions which had been in its control before the Versailles Treaty\u2014Alsace-Lorraine, Danzig and the Polish Corridor\u2014its area was {{convert|633786|km2|sqmi}}.

Under Hitler's rule, Germany became a [[Totalitarianism|totalitarian state]] where nearly all aspects of life were controlled by the government. The official name of the state was '''''Deutsches Reich''''' ([[German Reich]]) until 1943 and '''''Gro\u00dfdeutsches Reich''''' (Greater German Reich) from 1943 to 1945. Nazi Germany is also known as the '''Third Reich''' (''Drittes Reich''), meaning \"Third Realm\" or \"Third Empire\", alluding to the Nazis' perception that Nazi Germany was the successor of the earlier [[Holy Roman Empire|Holy Roman]] (800\u20131806) and [[German Empire|German]] (1871\u20131918) empires. The Nazi regime ended after the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] [[Victory in Europe Day|defeated Germany]] in May 1945, [[End of World War II in Europe|ending World War II in Europe]].\n\nHitler was appointed [[Chancellor of Germany]] by the [[President of Germany (1919\u20131945)|President]] of the [[Weimar Republic]], [[Paul von Hindenburg]], on 30 January 1933. The NSDAP then began to eliminate all political opposition and consolidate its power. Hindenburg died on 2 August 1934 and Hitler became dictator of Germany by merging the offices and powers of the Chancellery and Presidency. A national [[1934 German referendum|referendum held 19 August 1934]] confirmed Hitler as sole ''[[F\u00fchrer]]'' (leader) of Germany. All power was centralised in Hitler's person and his word became the highest law. The government was not a coordinated, co-operating body, but a collection of factions struggling for power and Hitler's favour. In the midst of the [[Great Depression]], the Nazis restored economic stability and ended mass unemployment using heavy military spending and a [[mixed economy]]. Using [[deficit spending]], the regime undertook extensive public works, including the construction of ''[[Reichsautobahn|Autobahn]]en'' (motorways). The return to economic stability boosted the regime's popularity.\n\n[[Racism]], especially [[antisemitism]], was a central ideological feature of the regime. The [[Germanic peoples]] were considered by the Nazis to be the [[master race]], the purest branch of the [[Aryan race]]. Discrimination and persecution against [[Jews]] and [[Romani people]] began in earnest after the seizure of power. The first [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camps]] were established in March 1933. Jews and others deemed undesirable were imprisoned, and liberals, socialists, and communists were killed, imprisoned, or exiled. Christian churches and citizens that [[German resistance to Nazism|opposed Hitler's rule]] were oppressed, and many leaders imprisoned. Education focused on [[scientific racism|racial biology]], population policy, and fitness for military service. Career and educational opportunities for women [[Women in Nazi Germany|were curtailed]]. Recreation and tourism were organised via the [[Strength Through Joy]] program, and the [[1936 Summer Olympics]] showcased Germany on the international stage. [[Reich Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda|Propaganda Minister]] [[Joseph Goebbels]] made effective use of film, mass rallies, and Hitler's hypnotic oratory to influence public opinion. The government controlled artistic expression, promoting specific art forms and banning or discouraging others.\n\nThe Nazi regime dominated neighbours through military threats in the years leading up to war. Nazi Germany made increasingly aggressive territorial demands, threatening war if these were not met. It seized [[Federal State of Austria|Austria]] and almost all of [[Second Czechoslovak Republic|Czechoslovakia]] in 1938 and 1939. Germany signed [[Molotov\u2013Ribbentrop Pact|a non-aggression pact]] with the [[Soviet Union|USSR]], and [[Invasion of Poland|invaded Poland]] on 1 September 1939, launching [[European theatre of World War II|World War II in Europe]]. By early 1941, Germany controlled much of Europe. ''[[Reichskommissariat]]s'' took control of conquered areas and a [[General Government|German administration]] was established in the remainder of Poland. Germany exploited the raw materials and labour of both its occupied territories and its allies. ''[[Einsatzgruppen]]'' paramilitary [[death squad]]s inside the occupied territories conducted mass killings of millions of Jews and [[Holocaust victims|other peoples]] deemed undesirable by the state. Many others were imprisoned, [[Extermination through labour|worked to death]], or murdered in [[Nazi concentration camps]] and [[extermination camp]]s. This [[genocide]] is known as [[the Holocaust]].\n\nWhile the [[Operation Barbarossa|German invasion]] of the [[Soviet Union]] in 1941 was initially successful, the Soviet resurgence and entry of the [[United States]] into the war meant the ''[[Wehrmacht]]'' (German armed forces) lost the initiative on the Eastern Front in 1943 and by late 1944 had been pushed back to the pre-1939 border. Large-scale aerial bombing of Germany escalated in 1944 and the [[Axis powers]] were driven back in Eastern and Southern Europe. After the [[Normandy landings|Allied invasion of France]], Germany was conquered by the Soviet Union from the east and the [[Allies of World War II|other Allies]] from the west, and capitulated in May 1945. Hitler's refusal to admit defeat led to massive destruction of German infrastructure and additional war-related deaths in the closing months of the war. The victorious Allies initiated a policy of [[denazification]] and put many of the surviving Nazi leadership on trial for war crimes at the [[Nuremberg trials]].\n\n== Name ==\n{{Further|Reich}}\nThe official name of the state was ''Deutsches Reich'' from 1933 to 1943 and ''Gro\u00dfdeutsches Reich'' from 1943 to 1945, while common English terms are \"Nazi Germany\" and \"Third Reich\". The latter, adopted by [[Nazi propaganda]] as ''Drittes Reich'', was first used in ''[[Das Dritte Reich]]'', a 1923 book by [[Arthur Moeller van den Bruck]]. The book counted the [[Holy Roman Empire]] (962\u20131806) as the first [[Reich]] and the [[German Empire]] (1871\u20131918) as the second.{{sfn|Lauryssens|1999|p=102}}\n\n== Background ==\n{{Further|Adolf Hitler's rise to power}}\nGermany was known as the [[Weimar Republic]] during the years 1919 to 1933. It was a [[republic]] with a [[semi-presidential system]]. The Weimar Republic faced numerous problems, including [[Hyperinflation in the Weimar Republic|hyperinflation]], political extremism (including violence from left- and right-wing paramilitaries), contentious relationships with the [[Allies of World War I|Allied victors]] of [[World War I]], and a series of failed attempts at coalition government by divided political parties.{{sfn|Childers|2017|pp=22\u201323, 35, 48, 124\u2013130, 152, 168\u2013169, 203\u2013204, 225\u2013226}} Severe setbacks to the German economy began after World War I ended, partly because of [[World War I reparations|reparations payments]] required under the 1919 [[Treaty of Versailles]]. The government printed money to make the payments and to repay the country's war debt, but the resulting hyperinflation led to inflated prices for consumer goods, economic chaos, and food riots.{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=103\u2013108}} When the government defaulted on their reparations payments in January 1923, French troops [[Occupation of the Ruhr|occupied German industrial areas]] along the [[Ruhr]] and widespread civil unrest followed.{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=186\u2013187}}\n\nThe [[Nazi Party|National Socialist German Workers' Party]] (''Nationalsozialistische Deutsche Arbeiterpartei'', NSDAP; Nazi Party) was founded in 1920. It was the renamed successor of the [[German Workers' Party]] (DAP) formed one year earlier, and one of several [[Far-right politics|far-right]] political parties then active in Germany.{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=170\u2013171}} The NSDAP party platform included destruction of the Weimar Republic, rejection of the terms of the Treaty of Versailles, radical [[antisemitism]], and anti-[[Bolshevism]].{{sfn|Goldhagen|1996|p=85}} They promised a strong central government, increased ''[[Lebensraum]]'' (\"living space\") for Germanic peoples, formation of a national community based on race, and racial cleansing via the active suppression of [[Jews]], who would be stripped of their citizenship and civil rights.{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=179\u2013180}} The Nazis proposed national and cultural renewal based upon the [[V\u00f6lkisch movement|''V\u00f6lkisch'' movement]].{{sfn|Kershaw|2008|p=81}} The party, especially its paramilitary organisation ''[[Sturmabteilung]]'' (SA; Storm Detachment; Brownshirts), used physical violence to advance their political position, disrupting the meetings of rival organisations and attacking their members (as well as Jewish people) on the streets.{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=180\u2013181}} Such far-right armed groups were common in [[Bavaria]], and were tolerated by the sympathetic far-right state government of [[Gustav Ritter von Kahr]].{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=181, 189}}\n\nWhen the stock market in the United States [[Wall Street Crash of 1929|crashed on 24 October 1929]], the effect in Germany was dire.{{sfn|Childers|2017|p=103}} Millions were thrown out of work and several major banks collapsed. Hitler and the NSDAP prepared to take advantage of the emergency to gain support for their party. They promised to strengthen the economy and provide jobs.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|pp=136\u2013137}} Many voters decided the NSDAP was capable of restoring order, quelling civil unrest, and improving Germany's international reputation. After the [[German federal election, July 1932|federal election of 1932]], the NSDAP was the largest party in the [[Reichstag (Weimar Republic)|Reichstag]], holding 230 seats with 37.4 percent of the popular vote.{{sfn|Goldhagen|1996|p=87}}\n\n== History ==\n{{See|History of Germany}}\n[[File:Hitler portrait crop.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Adolf Hitler]] became Germany's head of state, with the title of ''[[F\u00fchrer und Reichskanzler]]'', in 1934.]]\n=== Nazi seizure of power ===\n{{Main|Adolf Hitler's rise to power#Seizure of control (1931\u20131933)}}\nAlthough the Nazis won the greatest share of the popular vote in the two Reichstag general elections of 1932, they did not have a majority. Hitler therefore led a short-lived coalition government formed with the [[German National People's Party]].{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=293, 302}} Under pressure from politicians, industrialists, and the business community, President [[Paul von Hindenburg]] appointed Hitler as [[Chancellor of Germany]] on 30 January 1933. This event is known as the ''[[Machtergreifung]]'' (\"seizure of power\").{{sfn|Shirer|1960|pp=183\u2013184}}\n\nOn the night of 27 February 1933, the [[Reichstag fire|Reichstag building was set afire]]. [[Marinus van der Lubbe]], a Dutch communist, was found guilty of starting the blaze. Hitler proclaimed that the arson marked the start of a communist uprising. The [[Reichstag Fire Decree]], imposed on 28 February 1933, rescinded most civil liberties, including rights of assembly and freedom of the press. The decree also allowed the police to detain people indefinitely without charges. The legislation was accompanied by a propaganda campaign that led to public support for the measure. Violent suppression of communists by the SA was undertaken nationwide and 4,000 members of the [[Communist Party of Germany]] were arrested.{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=329\u2013334}}\n\nIn March 1933, the [[Enabling Act of 1933|Enabling Act]], an amendment to the [[Weimar Constitution]], passed in the Reichstag by a vote of 444 to 94.{{sfn|Evans|2003|p=354}} This amendment allowed Hitler and his cabinet to pass laws\u2014even laws that violated the constitution\u2014without the consent of the president or the Reichstag.{{sfn|Evans|2003|p=351}} As the bill required a two-thirds majority to pass, the Nazis used intimidation tactics as well as the provisions of the Reichstag Fire Decree to keep several [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democratic]] deputies from attending, and the Communists had already been banned.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=196}}{{sfn|Evans|2003|p=336}} On 10 May, the government seized the assets of the Social Democrats, and they were banned on 22 June.{{sfn|Evans|2003|pp=358\u2013359}} On 21 June, the SA raided the offices of the German National People's Party \u2013 their former coalition partners \u2013 and they disbanded on 29 June. The remaining major political parties followed suit. On 14 July 1933 Germany became a [[one-party state]] with the passage of a law decreeing the NSDAP to be the sole legal party in Germany. The founding of new parties was also made illegal, and all remaining political parties which had not already been dissolved were banned.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=201}} The Enabling Act would subsequently serve as the legal foundation for the dictatorship the NSDAP established.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=199}} Further elections [[November 1933 German parliamentary election|in November 1933]], [[German election and referendum, 1936|1936]], and [[German election and referendum, 1938|1938]] were Nazi-controlled, with only members of the NSDAP and a small number of independents elected.{{sfn|Evans|2005|pp=109, 637}}\n\n=== Nazification of Germany ===\n{{Main|Gleichschaltung}}\n[[File:Weimar Republic states map.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|While the [[States of the Weimar Republic|traditional German states]] were not formally abolished (excluding [[Free City of L\u00fcbeck|L\u00fcbeck]] [[Greater Hamburg Act|in 1937]]), their constitutional rights and sovereignty were eroded and ultimately ended.

The largest states of Prussia and Bavaria are coloured in light grey and light blue respectively.]]\nThe Hitler cabinet used the terms of the Reichstag Fire Decree and later the Enabling Act to initiate the process of ''Gleichschaltung'' (\"co-ordination\"), which brought all aspects of life under party control.{{sfn|McNab|2009|p=14}} Individual states not controlled by elected Nazi governments or Nazi-led coalitions were forced to agree to the appointment of Reich Commissars to bring the states in line with the policies of the central government. These Commissars had the power to appoint and remove local governments, state parliaments, officials, and judges. In this way Germany became a ''de facto'' [[unitary state]], with all state governments controlled by the central government under the NSDAP.{{sfn|Bracher|1970|pp=281\u201387}}{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=200}} The state parliaments and the ''[[Reichsrat (Germany)|Reichsrat]]'' (federal upper house) were abolished in January 1934,{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=109}} with all state powers being transferred to the central government.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=200}}\n\nAll civilian organisations, including agricultural groups, volunteer organisations, and sports clubs, had their leadership replaced with Nazi sympathisers or party members; these civic organisations either merged with the NSDAP or faced dissolution.{{sfn|Koonz|2003|p=73}} The Nazi government declared a \"Day of National Labor\" for [[May Day]] 1933, and invited many trade union delegates to Berlin for celebrations. The day after, SA stormtroopers demolished union offices around the country; all trade unions were forced to dissolve and their leaders were arrested.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=202}} The [[Law for the Restoration of the Professional Civil Service]], passed in April, removed from their jobs all teachers, professors, judges, magistrates, and government officials who were Jewish or whose commitment to the party was suspect.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=268}} This meant the only non-political institutions not under control of the NSDAP were the churches.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=14}}\n\nThe Nazi regime abolished the symbols of the Weimar Republic\u2014including the [[Flag of Germany|black, red, and gold tricolour flag]]\u2014and adopted reworked symbolism. The previous imperial black, white, and red tricolour was restored as one of Germany's two official flags; the second was the [[swastika flag]] of the NSDAP, which became the sole national flag in 1935. The NSDAP anthem \"[[Horst-Wessel-Lied]]\" (\"Horst Wessel Song\") became a second national anthem.{{sfn|Cuomo|1995|p=231}}\n\nGermany was still in a dire economic situation, as six million people were unemployed and the [[balance of trade]] deficit was daunting.{{sfn|McNab|2009|p=54}} Using [[deficit spending]], public works projects were undertaken beginning in 1934, creating 1.7&nbsp;million new jobs by the end of that year alone.{{sfn|McNab|2009|p=54}} Average wages began to rise.{{sfn|McNab|2009|p=56}}\n\n=== Consolidation of power ===\nThe SA leadership continued to apply pressure for greater political and military power.

The [[Bank of France]] was forced to provide 4.5&nbsp;billion Reichsmarks in \"credits\" to Germany, while a further 500,000 Reichsmarks were assessed against Vichy France by the Nazis in the form of \"fees\" and other miscellaneous charges. The Nazis exploited other conquered nations in a similar way. After the war, the [[United States Strategic Bombing Survey]] concluded Germany had obtained 104&nbsp;billion Reichsmarks in the form of occupation costs and other wealth transfers from occupied Europe, including two-thirds of the [[gross domestic product]] of Belgium and the Netherlands.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=943}}\n\nNazi plunder included private and public art collections, artefacts, precious metals, books, and personal possessions.

G\u00f6ring, having stripped almost all of occupied Poland of its artworks within six months of Germany's invasion, ultimately grew a collection valued at over 50 million Reichsmarks.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=945}} In 1940, the [[Reichsleiter Rosenberg Taskforce]] was established to loot artwork and cultural material from public and private collections, libraries, and museums throughout Europe. France saw the greatest extent of Nazi plunder. Some 26,000 railroad cars of art treasures, furniture, and other looted items were sent to Germany from France.{{sfn|Manvell|2011|pp=283\u2013285}} By January 1941, Rosenberg estimated the looted treasures from France to be valued at over one billion Reichsmarks.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=946}} In addition, soldiers looted or purchased goods such as produce and clothing\u2014items, which were becoming harder to obtain in Germany\u2014for shipment home.{{sfn|Evans|2008|p=334}}\n\nGoods and raw materials were also taken. In France, an estimated {{convert|9000000|t|LT ST}} of [[cereal]]s were seized during the course of the war, including 75 percent of its oats. In addition, 80 percent of the country's oil and 74 percent of its steel production were taken. The valuation of this loot is estimated to be 184.5&nbsp;billion [[franc]]s. In Poland, Nazi plunder of raw materials began even before the German invasion had concluded.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=944}}\n\nFollowing Operation Barbarossa, the Soviet Union was also plundered.

During the course of the German occupation, some 12 million pigs and 13&nbsp;million sheep were taken. The value of this plunder is estimated at 4&nbsp;billion Reichsmarks.

Outside of Germany, the Romani people were regularly used for forced labour, though many were killed. In the Baltic states and the Soviet Union, 30,000 Romani were killed by the SS, the German Army, and ''Einsatzgruppen''.

By July 1933, radio station staffs were purged of leftists and others deemed undesirable.{{sfn|Evans|2005|pp=133\u2013135}} Propaganda and speeches were typical radio fare immediately after the seizure of power, but as time went on Goebbels insisted that more music be played so that listeners would not turn to foreign broadcasters for entertainment.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=136}}\n\n=== Censorship ===\n{{See also|List of authors banned in Nazi Germany}}\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-14597, Berlin, Opernplatz, B\u00fccherverbrennung.jpg|thumb|A Nazi book burning on 10 May 1933 in Berlin, as books by Jewish and [[leftist]] authors are burned{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=16}}|alt=|left]]\nNewspapers, like other media, were controlled by the state; the Reich Press Chamber shut down or bought newspapers and publishing houses. By 1939, over two-thirds of the newspapers and magazines were directly owned by the Propaganda Ministry.{{sfn|Evans|2005|pp=143\u2013144}} The NSDAP daily newspaper, the ''[[V\u00f6lkischer Beobachter]]'' (\"Ethnic Observer\"), was edited by Rosenberg, who also wrote ''[[The Myth of the Twentieth Century]]'', a book of racial theories espousing Nordic superiority.{{sfn|Shirer|1960|p=149}} Goebbels controlled the wire services and insisted that all newspapers in Germany only publish content favourable to the regime. Under Goebbels, the Propaganda Ministry issued two dozen directives every week on exactly what news should be published and what angles to use; the typical newspaper followed the directives closely, especially regarding what to omit.{{sfn|Dussel|2010|pp=545, 555\u2013557}} Newspaper readership plummeted, partly because of the decreased quality of the content and partly because of the surge in popularity of radio.{{sfn|Evans|2005|pp=146\u2013147}} Propaganda became less effective towards the end of the war, as people were able to obtain information outside of official channels.{{sfn|Dussel|2010|pp=561}}\n\nAuthors of books left the country in droves and some wrote material critical of the regime while in exile. Goebbels recommended that the remaining authors concentrate on books themed on Germanic myths and the concept of [[blood and soil]]. By the end of 1933, over a thousand books\u2014most of them by Jewish authors or featuring Jewish characters\u2014had been banned by the Nazi regime.{{sfn|Evans|2005|pp=152\u2013159}} [[Nazi book burnings]] took place; nineteen such events were held on the night of 10 May 1933.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=16}} Tens of thousands of books from dozens of figures, including [[Albert Einstein]], [[Sigmund Freud]], [[Helen Keller]], [[Alfred Kerr]], [[Marcel Proust]], [[Erich Maria Remarque]], [[Upton Sinclair]], [[Jakob Wassermann]], [[H.

The [[Degenerate Art Exhibition]], organised by Goebbels, ran in Munich from July to November 1937. The exhibition proved wildly popular, attracting over two million visitors.{{sfn|Evans|2005|pp=171, 173}}\n\nComposer [[Richard Strauss]] was appointed president of the ''[[Reichsmusikkammer]]'' (Reich Music Chamber) on its founding in November 1933.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=187}} As was the case with other art forms, the Nazis ostracised musicians who were deemed racially unacceptable and for the most part disapproved of music that was too modern or [[atonal]].{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=199}} [[Jazz]] was considered especially inappropriate and foreign jazz musicians left the country or were expelled.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=204}} Hitler favoured the music of [[Richard Wagner]], especially pieces based on Germanic myths and heroic stories, and attended the [[Bayreuth Festival]] each year from 1933 to 1942.{{sfn|Evans|2005|pp=199\u2013200}}\n\n=== Film ===\n{{Main|Nazism and cinema}}\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1988-106-29, Leni Riefenstahl bei Dreharbeiten.jpg|thumb|[[Leni Riefenstahl]] (behind cameraman) at the 1936 Summer Olympics|alt=|left]]\nMovies were popular in Germany in the 1930s and 1940s, with admissions of over a billion people in 1942, 1943 and 1944.{{sfn|Evans|2005|p=130}}{{sfn|SPIO, Department of Statistics}} By 1934, German regulations restricting currency exports made it impossible for US film makers to take their profits back to America, so the major film studios closed their German branches. Exports of German films plummeted, as their antisemitic content made them impossible to show in other countries. The two largest film companies, [[Universum Film AG]] and [[Wien-Film|Tobis]], were purchased by the Propaganda Ministry, which by 1939 was producing most German films. The productions were not always overtly propagandistic, but generally had a political subtext and followed party lines regarding themes and content.

The result was convictions of 1,426 people; 297 of these were sentenced to death and 279 to life in prison, with the remainder receiving lesser sentences. About 65 percent of the death sentences were carried out.{{sfn|Marcuse|2001|p=98}} Poland was more active than other nations in investigating war crimes, for example prosecuting 673 of the total 789 Auschwitz staff brought to trial.{{sfn|Rees|2005|pp=295\u201396}}\n\nThe political programme espoused by Hitler and the NSDAP brought about a world war, leaving behind a devastated and impoverished Europe.

However, expression of Nazi views was frowned upon, and those who expressed such views were frequently dismissed from their jobs.{{sfn|Evans|2008|pp=748\u2013749}} From the immediate post-war period through the 1950s, people avoided talking about the Nazi regime or their own wartime experiences. While virtually every family suffered losses during the war has a story to tell, Germans kept quiet about their experiences and felt a sense of communal guilt, even if they were not directly involved in war crimes.{{sfn|Sontheimer|2005}}\n\nThe trial of [[Adolf Eichmann]] in 1961 and the broadcast of the television miniseries ''[[Holocaust (miniseries)|Holocaust]]'' in 1979 brought the process of ''[[Vergangenheitsbew\u00e4ltigung]]'' (coping with the past) to the forefront for many Germans.{{sfn|''The Economist''|2015}}{{sfn|Sontheimer|2005}} Once study of Nazi Germany was introduced into the school [[curriculum]] starting in the 1970s, people began researching the experiences of their family members.

The favored ''\u03b3-process'' (see below) in [[Type II supernova|core-collapse supernovae]] cannot produce\nall p-nuclei in sufficient amounts, according to current [[computer simulation]]s. This is why additional production mechanisms and astrophysical sites are under investigation, as outlined below. It is also conceivable that there is not just a single process responsible for all p-nuclei but that different processes in a number of astrophysical sites produce certain ranges of p-nuclei.<ref name=\"posnic2010\">T. Rauscher: ''Origin of p-Nuclei in Explosive Nucleosynthesis.'' In: ''Proceedings of Science'' [http://pos.sissa.it/archive/conferences/100/059/NIC XI_059.pdf PoS(NIC XI)059]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, 2010 ([https://arxiv.org/abs/1012.2213 arXiv.org:1012.2213])</ref>\n\nIn the search for the relevant processes creating p-nuclei, the usual way is to identify the possible production mechanisms (processes) and then to investigate their possible realization in various astrophysical sites. The same logic is applied in the discussion below.\n\n=== Basics of p-nuclide production ===\n\nIn principle, there are two ways to produce proton-rich [[nuclide]]s: by successively adding [[proton]]s to a nuclide (these are [[nuclear reaction]]s of type (p,\u03b3) or by removing neutrons from a nucleus through sequences of [[photodisintegration]]s of type (\u03b3,n).<ref name=\"arnould\" /><ref name=\"posnic2010\" />\n\nUnder conditions encountered in astrophysical environments it is difficult to obtain p-nuclei through proton captures because the [[Coulomb barrier]] of a nucleus increases with increasing [[proton number]]. A proton requires more energy to be incorporated (''captured'') into an atomic nucleus when the Coulomb barrier is higher. The available average energy of the protons is determined by the [[temperature]] of the stellar [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]]. Increasing the temperature, however, also speeds up the (\u03b3,p) photodisintegrations which counteract the (p,\u03b3) captures. The only alternative avoiding this would be to have a very large number of protons available so that the effective number of captures per second is large even at low temperature. In extreme cases (as discussed below) this leads to the synthesis of extremely short-lived [[radionuclide]]s which [[Radioactive decay|decay]] to stable nuclides only after the captures cease.<ref name=\"arnould\" /><ref name=\"posnic2010\" />\n\nAppropriate combinations of temperature and proton density of a stellar plasma have to be explored in the search of possible production mechanisms for p-nuclei. Further [[parameter]]s are the time available for the nuclear processes, and number and type of initially present nuclides (''seed nuclei'').\n\n=== Possible processes ===\n\n==== The p-process ====\n{{Main article|p-process}}\nIn a p-process it is suggested that p-nuclei were made through a few proton captures on stable nuclides. The seed nuclei originate from the s- and r-process and are already present in the stellar plasma. As outlined above, there are serious difficulties explaining all p-nuclei through such a process although it was originally suggested to achieve exactly this.<ref name=\"b2fh\" /><ref name=\"cameron\" /><ref name=\"arnould\" /> It was shown later that the required conditions are not reached in [[star]]s or stellar explosions.<ref name=\"truran\">J. Audouze, J. W. Truran: ''P-process nucleosynthesis in postshock supernova envelope environments.'' In: ''The Astrophysical Journal'', Vol. 202, 1975, p. 204-213. ( {{doi|10.1086/153965}})</ref>\n\nBased on its historical meaning, the term ''p-process'' is sometimes sloppily used for any process synthesizing p-nuclei, even when no proton captures are involved.\n\n==== The \u03b3-process ====\np-Nuclei can also be obtained by [[photodisintegration]] of [[s-process|''s''-process]] and [[r-process|''r''-process]] nuclei.

( {{doi|10.1086/168839}})</ref>\n\n==== Rapid proton capture processes ====\n\nIn a p-process protons are added to stable or weakly [[Radioactive decay|radioactive]] [[atomic nuclei]]. \nIf there is a high proton density in the stellar plasma, even short-lived [[radionuclides]] can capture one or more protons before they [[beta decay]]. This quickly moves the [[nucleosynthesis]] path from the region of stable nuclei to the very proton-rich side of the [[chart of nuclides]]. This is called ''rapid proton capture''.<ref name=\"posnic2010\" />\n\nHere, a series of (p,\u03b3) reactions proceeds until either the [[beta decay]] of a nucleus is faster than a further proton capture, or the [[proton drip line]] is reached. Both cases lead to one or several sequential beta decays until a nucleus is produced which again can capture protons before it beta decays. Then the proton capture sequences continue.\n\nIt is possible to cover the region of the lightest nuclei up to <sup>56</sup>Ni within a second because both proton captures and beta decays are fast. Starting with <sup>56</sup>Ni, however, a number of ''waiting points'' are encountered in the reaction path. These are nuclides which both have relatively long [[half-life|half-lives]] (compared to the process timescale) and can only slowly add another proton (that is, their [[Cross section (physics)|cross section]] for (p,\u03b3) reactions is small). Examples for such waiting points are: <sup>56</sup>Ni, <sup>60</sup>Zn, <sup>64</sup>Ge, <sup>68</sup>Se. Further waiting points may be important, depending on the detailed conditions and location of the reaction path. It is typical for such waiting points to show half-lives of minutes to days. Thus, they considerably increase the time required to continue the reaction sequences. If the conditions required for this rapid proton capture are only present for a short time (the timescale of explosive astrophysical events is of the order of seconds), the waiting points limit or hamper the continuation of the reactions to heavier nuclei.<ref name=\"schatz\">H. Schatz, et al.: ''rp-Process Nucleosynthesis at Extreme Temperature and Density Conditions.'' In: ''Physics Reports'', Vol. 294, 1998, p. 167-263. ( {{doi|10.1016/S0370-1573(97)00048-3}})</ref>\n\nIn order to produce p-nuclei, the process path has to encompass nuclides bearing the same [[mass number]] (but usually containing more protons) as the desired p-nuclei. These nuclides are then converted into p-nuclei through sequences of beta decays after the rapid proton captures ceased.\n\nVariations of the main category ''rapid proton captures'' are the rp-, pn-, and \u03bdp-processes, which will be briefly outlined below.\n\n===== The rp-process =====\n{{Main article|rp-process}}\nThe so-called '''rp-process''' (''rp'' is for ''rapid proton capture'') is the purest form of the rapid proton capture process described above. At proton densities of more than {{val|e=28}} protons/cm<sup>3</sup> and temperatures around 2 GK the reaction path is close to the [[proton drip line]].<ref name=\"schatz\" /> The waiting points can be bridged provided that the process time is 10-600 s. Waiting-point nuclides are produced with larger abundances while the production of nuclei \"behind\" each waiting-point is more and more suppressed.\n\nA definitive endpoint is reached close to <sup>104</sup>Te because the reaction path runs into a region of nuclides which decay preferably by [[alpha decay]] and thus loop the path back onto itself.<ref name=\"rp-end\">H. Schatz, et al.: ''End Point of the rp Process on Accreting Neutron Stars.'' In: ''Physical Review Letters'', Vol. 86, 2001, p. 3471-3474. ([https://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.86.3471 ] {{doi|10.1016/10.1103/PhysRevLett.86.3471}})</ref> Therefore, an rp-process would only be able to produce p-nuclei with [[mass number]]s less than or equal to 104.\n\n===== The pn-process =====\nThe waiting points in rapid proton capture processes can be avoided by (n,p) reactions which are much faster than proton captures on or beta decays of waiting points nuclei. This results in a considerable reduction of the time required to build heavy elements and allows an efficient production within seconds.<ref name=\"arnould\" /> This requires, however, a (small) supply of free [[neutron]]s which are usually not present in such proton-rich plasmas. One way to obtain them is to release them through other reactions occurring simultaneously as the rapid proton captures.

Since (anti-)neutrinos interact only very weakly with protons, a high [[flux]] of anti-neutrinos has to act on a plasma with high proton density.

In such a supernova, a shockfront from an explosion runs from the center of the star through its outer layers and ejects these. When the shockfront reaches the O/Ne-shell of the star (see also [[stellar evolution]]), the conditions for a \u03b3-process are reached for 1-2 s.\n\nAlthough the majority of p-nuclei can be made in this way, some [[mass number|mass]] regions of p-nuclei turn out to be problematic in model calculations. It has been known already for decades that p-nuclei with mass numbers {{nowrap|A &lt; 100}} cannot be produced in a \u03b3-process.<ref name=\"arnould\" /><ref name=\"woosley\" /> Modern simulations also show problems in the range {{nowrap|150 \u2264 A \u2264 165}}.<ref name=\"posnic2010\" /><ref name=\"rhhw\">T.

A hot [[neutron star]] is made in the center of such a core-collapse supernova and it radiates neutrinos with high intensity.

Due to the initially high flow of neutrinos from the forming neutron star, these layers become extremely proton-rich through the reaction {{nowrap|{{SubatomicParticle|Electron neutrino}} + {{SubatomicParticle|Neutron}} \u2192 {{SubatomicParticle|Electron}} + {{SubatomicParticle|Proton}}}}. Although the anti-neutrino flux is initially weaker a few neutrons will be created, nevertheless, because of the large number of protons. This allows a ''&nu;p-process'' in these deep layers. Because of the short timescale of the explosion and the high [[Coulomb barrier]] of the heavier nuclei, such a \u03bdp-process could possibly only produce the lightest p-nuclei. Which nuclei are made and how much of them depends sensitively on many details in the simulations and also on the actual explosion mechanism of a core-collapse supernova, which still is not completely understood.<ref name=\"nup-process\" /><ref name=\"nup-process2\">C. Fr\u00f6hlich, et al.: ''Composition of the Innermost Core-Collapse Supernova Ejecta.'' In: ''The Astrophysical Journal'', Vol. 637, 2006, p. 415-426. ( {{doi|10.1086/498224}})</ref>\n\n==== Thermonuclear supernovae ====\n\nA [[thermonuclear supernova]] is the explosion of a [[white dwarf]] in a [[binary star]] system, triggered by thermonuclear reactions in matter from a companion star [[Accretion (astrophysics)|accreted]] on the surface of the white dwarf. The accreted matter is rich in [[hydrogen]] (protons) and [[helium]] ([[Alpha particle|&alpha; particles]]) and becomes hot enough to allow [[nuclear reaction]]s.\n\nA number of models for such explosions are discussed in literature, of which two were explored regarding the prospect of producing p-nuclei. None of these explosions release neutrinos, therefore rendering \u03bd- and \u03bdp-process impossible. Conditions required for the rp-process are also not attained.\n\nDetails of the possible production of p-nuclei in such supernovae depend sensitively on the composition of the matter accreted from the companion star (the ''seed nuclei'' for all subsequent processes). Since this can change considerably from star to star, all statements and models of p-production in thermonuclear supernovae are prone to large uncertainties.<ref name=\"arnould\" />\n\n===== Type Ia supernovae =====\nThe consensus model of thermonuclear supernovae postulates that the white dwarf explodes after exceeding the [[Chandrasekhar limit]] by the accretion of matter because the contraction and heating ignites explosive [[carbon burning]] under [[Degenerate matter|degenerate]] conditions. A nuclear burning front runs through the white dwarf from the inside out and tears it apart. Then the outermost layers closely beneath the surface of the white dwarf (containing 0.05 [[solar mass]]es of matter) exhibit the right conditions for a \u03b3-process.<ref name=\"Ia-gamma\">W. M. Howard, S. B. Meyer, S. E. Woosley: ''A new site for the astrophysical gamma-process.'' In: ''The Astrophysical Journal Letters'', Vol. 373, 1991, p. L5-L8. ( {{doi|10.1086/186038}})</ref>\n\nThe p-nuclei are made in the same way as in the \u03b3-process in core-collapse supernovae and also the same difficulties are encountered. In addition, <sup>138</sup>La and <sup>180m</sup>Ta are not produced. A variation of the seed abundances by assuming increased [[s-process]] abundances only scales the abundances of the resulting p-nuclei without curing the problems of relative underproduction in the nuclear mass ranges given above.<ref name=\"arnould\" />\n\n===== subChandrasekhar supernovae =====\nIn a subclass of [[type Ia supernova]]e, the so-called '''subChandrasekhar supernova''', the white dwarf may explode long before it reaches the Chandrasekhar limit because nuclear reactions in the accreted matter can already heat the white dwarf during its accretion phase and trigger explosive carbon burning prematurely. Helium-rich accretion favors this type of explosion. [[Helium burning]] ignites degeneratively on the bottom of the accreted helium layer and causes two shockfronts. The one running inwards ignites the carbon explosion. The outwards moving front heats the outer layers of the white dwarf and ejects them. Again, these outer layers are site to a \u03b3-process at temperatures of 2-3 GK. Due to the presence of \u03b1 particles (helium nuclei), however, additional nuclear reactions become possible. Among those are such which release a large number of neutrons, such as <sup>18</sup>O(\u03b1,n)<sup>21</sup>Ne, <sup>22</sup>Ne(\u03b1,n)<sup>25</sup>Mg, and <sup>26</sup>Mg(\u03b1,n)<sup>29</sup>Si. This allows a ''pn-process'' in that part of the outer layers which experiences temperatures above 3 GK.<ref name=\"arnould\" /><ref name=\"pn-proc\" />\n\nThose light p-nuclei which are underproduced in the \u03b3-process can be so efficiently made in the pn-process that they even show much larger abundances than the other p-nuclei. To obtain the observed solar relative abundances, a strongly enhanced [[s-process]] seed (by factors of 100-1000 or more) has to be assumed which increases the yield of heavy p-nuclei from the \u03b3-process.<ref name=\"arnould\" /><ref name=\"pn-proc\" />\n\n==== Neutron stars in binary star systems ====\n{{Main article|rp-process}}\nA [[neutron star]] in a [[binary star]] system can also accrete matter from the companion star on its surface. Combined [[hydrogen burning|hydrogen]] and [[helium burning]] ignites when the accreted layer of [[degenerate matter]] reaches a density of\n{{nowrap|{{val|e=5}}\u2013{{val|e=6}} g/cm<sup>3</sup>}} and a temperature exceeding {{val|0.2|u=GK}}. This leads to [[thermonuclear]] burning comparable to what happens in the outwards moving shockfront of subChandrasekhar supernovae. The neutron star itself is not affected by the explosion and therefore the nuclear reactions in the accreted layer can proceed longer than in an explosion. This allows to establish an rp-process. It will continue until either all free protons are used up or the burning layer has expanded due to the increase in temperature and its density falls below the one required for the nuclear reactions.<ref name=\"schatz\" />\n\nIt was shown that the properties of [[X-ray burster|X-ray bursts]] in the [[Milky Way]] can be explained by an rp-process on the surface of accreting neutron stars.<ref name=\"x-bursts\">S.

Only if this is the case can such objects be considered as possible sources of p-nuclei.

The favored ''\u03b3-process'' (see below) in [[Type II supernova|core-collapse supernovae]] cannot produce\nall p-nuclei in sufficient amounts, according to current [[computer simulation]]s. This is why additional production mechanisms and astrophysical sites are under investigation, as outlined below. It is also conceivable that there is not just a single process responsible for all p-nuclei but that different processes in a number of astrophysical sites produce certain ranges of p-nuclei.<ref name=\"posnic2010\">T. Rauscher: ''Origin of p-Nuclei in Explosive Nucleosynthesis.''

The same logic is applied in the discussion below.\n\n=== Basics of p-nuclide production ===\n\nIn principle, there are two ways to produce proton-rich [[nuclide]]s: by successively adding [[proton]]s to a nuclide (these are [[nuclear reaction]]s of type (p,\u03b3) or by removing neutrons from a nucleus through sequences of [[photodisintegration]]s of type (\u03b3,n).<ref name=\"arnould\" /><ref name=\"posnic2010\" />\n\nUnder conditions encountered in astrophysical environments it is difficult to obtain p-nuclei through proton captures because the [[Coulomb barrier]] of a nucleus increases with increasing [[proton number]]. A proton requires more energy to be incorporated (''captured'') into an atomic nucleus when the Coulomb barrier is higher. The available average energy of the protons is determined by the [[temperature]] of the stellar [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]]. Increasing the temperature, however, also speeds up the (\u03b3,p) photodisintegrations which counteract the (p,\u03b3) captures. The only alternative avoiding this would be to have a very large number of protons available so that the effective number of captures per second is large even at low temperature. In extreme cases (as discussed below) this leads to the synthesis of extremely short-lived [[radionuclide]]s which [[Radioactive decay|decay]] to stable nuclides only after the captures cease.<ref name=\"arnould\" /><ref name=\"posnic2010\" />\n\nAppropriate combinations of temperature and proton density of a stellar plasma have to be explored in the search of possible production mechanisms for p-nuclei. Further [[parameter]]s are the time available for the nuclear processes, and number and type of initially present nuclides (''seed nuclei'').\n\n=== Possible processes ===\n\n==== The p-process ====\n{{Main article|p-process}}\nIn a p-process it is suggested that p-nuclei were made through a few proton captures on stable nuclides. The seed nuclei originate from the s- and r-process and are already present in the stellar plasma. As outlined above, there are serious difficulties explaining all p-nuclei through such a process although it was originally suggested to achieve exactly this.<ref name=\"b2fh\" /><ref name=\"cameron\" /><ref name=\"arnould\" /> It was shown later that the required conditions are not reached in [[star]]s or stellar explosions.<ref name=\"truran\">J.

At temperatures around 2\u20133&nbsp;[[giga]][[kelvin]]s (GK) and short process time of a few seconds (this requires an explosive process) photodisintegration of the pre-existing nuclei will remain small, just enough to produce the required tiny abundances of p-nuclei.<ref name=\"arnould\" /><ref name=\"woosley\">S.

( {{doi|10.1086/168839}})</ref>\n\n==== Rapid proton capture processes ====\n\nIn a p-process protons are added to stable or weakly [[Radioactive decay|radioactive]] [[atomic nuclei]]. \nIf there is a high proton density in the stellar plasma, even short-lived [[radionuclides]] can capture one or more protons before they [[beta decay]]. This quickly moves the [[nucleosynthesis]] path from the region of stable nuclei to the very proton-rich side of the [[chart of nuclides]]. This is called ''rapid proton capture''.<ref name=\"posnic2010\" />\n\nHere, a series of (p,\u03b3) reactions proceeds until either the [[beta decay]] of a nucleus is faster than a further proton capture, or the [[proton drip line]] is reached. Both cases lead to one or several sequential beta decays until a nucleus is produced which again can capture protons before it beta decays. Then the proton capture sequences continue.\n\nIt is possible to cover the region of the lightest nuclei up to <sup>56</sup>Ni within a second because both proton captures and beta decays are fast. Starting with <sup>56</sup>Ni, however, a number of ''waiting points'' are encountered in the reaction path. These are nuclides which both have relatively long [[half-life|half-lives]] (compared to the process timescale) and can only slowly add another proton (that is, their [[Cross section (physics)|cross section]] for (p,\u03b3) reactions is small). Examples for such waiting points are: <sup>56</sup>Ni, <sup>60</sup>Zn, <sup>64</sup>Ge, <sup>68</sup>Se. Further waiting points may be important, depending on the detailed conditions and location of the reaction path. It is typical for such waiting points to show half-lives of minutes to days. Thus, they considerably increase the time required to continue the reaction sequences. If the conditions required for this rapid proton capture are only present for a short time (the timescale of explosive astrophysical events is of the order of seconds), the waiting points limit or hamper the continuation of the reactions to heavier nuclei.<ref name=\"schatz\">H. Schatz, et al.: ''rp-Process Nucleosynthesis at Extreme Temperature and Density Conditions.'' In: ''Physics Reports'', Vol. 294, 1998, p. 167-263. ( {{doi|10.1016/S0370-1573(97)00048-3}})</ref>\n\nIn order to produce p-nuclei, the process path has to encompass nuclides bearing the same [[mass number]] (but usually containing more protons) as the desired p-nuclei. These nuclides are then converted into p-nuclei through sequences of beta decays after the rapid proton captures ceased.\n\nVariations of the main category ''rapid proton captures'' are the rp-, pn-, and \u03bdp-processes, which will be briefly outlined below.\n\n===== The rp-process =====\n{{Main article|rp-process}}\nThe so-called '''rp-process''' (''rp'' is for ''rapid proton capture'') is the purest form of the rapid proton capture process described above. At proton densities of more than {{val|e=28}} protons/cm<sup>3</sup> and temperatures around 2 GK the reaction path is close to the [[proton drip line]].<ref name=\"schatz\" /> The waiting points can be bridged provided that the process time is 10-600 s. Waiting-point nuclides are produced with larger abundances while the production of nuclei \"behind\" each waiting-point is more and more suppressed.\n\nA definitive endpoint is reached close to <sup>104</sup>Te because the reaction path runs into a region of nuclides which decay preferably by [[alpha decay]] and thus loop the path back onto itself.<ref name=\"rp-end\">H. Schatz, et al.: ''End Point of the rp Process on Accreting Neutron Stars.'' In: ''Physical Review Letters'', Vol. 86, 2001, p. 3471-3474. ([https://dx.doi.org/10.1103/PhysRevLett.86.3471 ] {{doi|10.1016/10.1103/PhysRevLett.86.3471}})</ref> Therefore, an rp-process would only be able to produce p-nuclei with [[mass number]]s less than or equal to 104.\n\n===== The pn-process =====\nThe waiting points in rapid proton capture processes can be avoided by (n,p) reactions which are much faster than proton captures on or beta decays of waiting points nuclei. This results in a considerable reduction of the time required to build heavy elements and allows an efficient production within seconds.<ref name=\"arnould\" /> This requires, however, a (small) supply of free [[neutron]]s which are usually not present in such proton-rich plasmas. One way to obtain them is to release them through other reactions occurring simultaneously as the rapid proton captures. This is called ''neutron-rich rapid proton capture'' or '''pn-process'''.<ref name=\"pn-proc\">S. Goriely, J. Jos\u00e9, M. Hernanz, M. Rayet, M.

Since (anti-)neutrinos interact only very weakly with protons, a high [[flux]] of anti-neutrinos has to act on a plasma with high proton density.

In such a supernova, a shockfront from an explosion runs from the center of the star through its outer layers and ejects these. When the shockfront reaches the O/Ne-shell of the star (see also [[stellar evolution]]), the conditions for a \u03b3-process are reached for 1-2 s.\n\nAlthough the majority of p-nuclei can be made in this way, some [[mass number|mass]] regions of p-nuclei turn out to be problematic in model calculations. It has been known already for decades that p-nuclei with mass numbers {{nowrap|A &lt; 100}} cannot be produced in a \u03b3-process.<ref name=\"arnould\" /><ref name=\"woosley\" /> Modern simulations also show problems in the range {{nowrap|150 \u2264 A \u2264 165}}.<ref name=\"posnic2010\" /><ref name=\"rhhw\">T.

A hot [[neutron star]] is made in the center of such a core-collapse supernova and it radiates neutrinos with high intensity. The neutrinos interact also with the outer layers of the exploding star and cause nuclear reactions which create <sup>138</sup>La, among other nuclei.<ref name=\"nu-process\" /><ref name=\"rhhw\" /> Also <sup>180m</sup>Ta may receive a contribution from this \u03bd-process.\n\nIt was suggested<ref name=\"nup-process\" /> to supplement the \u03b3-process in the outer layers of the star by another process, occurring in the deepest layers of the star, close to the neutron star but still being ejected instead of falling onto the neutron star surface. Due to the initially high flow of neutrinos from the forming neutron star, these layers become extremely proton-rich through the reaction {{nowrap|{{SubatomicParticle|Electron neutrino}} + {{SubatomicParticle|Neutron}} \u2192 {{SubatomicParticle|Electron}} + {{SubatomicParticle|Proton}}}}. Although the anti-neutrino flux is initially weaker a few neutrons will be created, nevertheless, because of the large number of protons. This allows a ''&nu;p-process'' in these deep layers. Because of the short timescale of the explosion and the high [[Coulomb barrier]] of the heavier nuclei, such a \u03bdp-process could possibly only produce the lightest p-nuclei. Which nuclei are made and how much of them depends sensitively on many details in the simulations and also on the actual explosion mechanism of a core-collapse supernova, which still is not completely understood.<ref name=\"nup-process\" /><ref name=\"nup-process2\">C. Fr\u00f6hlich, et al.: ''Composition of the Innermost Core-Collapse Supernova Ejecta.'' In: ''The Astrophysical Journal'', Vol. 637, 2006, p. 415-426. ( {{doi|10.1086/498224}})</ref>\n\n==== Thermonuclear supernovae ====\n\nA [[thermonuclear supernova]] is the explosion of a [[white dwarf]] in a [[binary star]] system, triggered by thermonuclear reactions in matter from a companion star [[Accretion (astrophysics)|accreted]] on the surface of the white dwarf. The accreted matter is rich in [[hydrogen]] (protons) and [[helium]] ([[Alpha particle|&alpha; particles]]) and becomes hot enough to allow [[nuclear reaction]]s.\n\nA number of models for such explosions are discussed in literature, of which two were explored regarding the prospect of producing p-nuclei. None of these explosions release neutrinos, therefore rendering \u03bd- and \u03bdp-process impossible. Conditions required for the rp-process are also not attained.\n\nDetails of the possible production of p-nuclei in such supernovae depend sensitively on the composition of the matter accreted from the companion star (the ''seed nuclei'' for all subsequent processes). Since this can change considerably from star to star, all statements and models of p-production in thermonuclear supernovae are prone to large uncertainties.<ref name=\"arnould\" />\n\n===== Type Ia supernovae =====\nThe consensus model of thermonuclear supernovae postulates that the white dwarf explodes after exceeding the [[Chandrasekhar limit]] by the accretion of matter because the contraction and heating ignites explosive [[carbon burning]] under [[Degenerate matter|degenerate]] conditions. A nuclear burning front runs through the white dwarf from the inside out and tears it apart. Then the outermost layers closely beneath the surface of the white dwarf (containing 0.05 [[solar mass]]es of matter) exhibit the right conditions for a \u03b3-process.<ref name=\"Ia-gamma\">W. M. Howard, S. B. Meyer, S. E. Woosley: ''A new site for the astrophysical gamma-process.'' In: ''The Astrophysical Journal Letters'', Vol. 373, 1991, p. L5-L8. ( {{doi|10.1086/186038}})</ref>\n\nThe p-nuclei are made in the same way as in the \u03b3-process in core-collapse supernovae and also the same difficulties are encountered. In addition, <sup>138</sup>La and <sup>180m</sup>Ta are not produced. A variation of the seed abundances by assuming increased [[s-process]] abundances only scales the abundances of the resulting p-nuclei without curing the problems of relative underproduction in the nuclear mass ranges given above.<ref name=\"arnould\" />\n\n===== subChandrasekhar supernovae =====\nIn a subclass of [[type Ia supernova]]e, the so-called '''subChandrasekhar supernova''', the white dwarf may explode long before it reaches the Chandrasekhar limit because nuclear reactions in the accreted matter can already heat the white dwarf during its accretion phase and trigger explosive carbon burning prematurely. Helium-rich accretion favors this type of explosion. [[Helium burning]] ignites degeneratively on the bottom of the accreted helium layer and causes two shockfronts. The one running inwards ignites the carbon explosion. The outwards moving front heats the outer layers of the white dwarf and ejects them. Again, these outer layers are site to a \u03b3-process at temperatures of 2-3 GK. Due to the presence of \u03b1 particles (helium nuclei), however, additional nuclear reactions become possible. Among those are such which release a large number of neutrons, such as <sup>18</sup>O(\u03b1,n)<sup>21</sup>Ne, <sup>22</sup>Ne(\u03b1,n)<sup>25</sup>Mg, and <sup>26</sup>Mg(\u03b1,n)<sup>29</sup>Si. This allows a ''pn-process'' in that part of the outer layers which experiences temperatures above 3 GK.<ref name=\"arnould\" /><ref name=\"pn-proc\" />\n\nThose light p-nuclei which are underproduced in the \u03b3-process can be so efficiently made in the pn-process that they even show much larger abundances than the other p-nuclei. To obtain the observed solar relative abundances, a strongly enhanced [[s-process]] seed (by factors of 100-1000 or more) has to be assumed which increases the yield of heavy p-nuclei from the \u03b3-process.<ref name=\"arnould\" /><ref name=\"pn-proc\" />\n\n==== Neutron stars in binary star systems ====\n{{Main article|rp-process}}\nA [[neutron star]] in a [[binary star]] system can also accrete matter from the companion star on its surface. Combined [[hydrogen burning|hydrogen]] and [[helium burning]] ignites when the accreted layer of [[degenerate matter]] reaches a density of\n{{nowrap|{{val|e=5}}\u2013{{val|e=6}} g/cm<sup>3</sup>}} and a temperature exceeding {{val|0.2|u=GK}}. This leads to [[thermonuclear]] burning comparable to what happens in the outwards moving shockfront of subChandrasekhar supernovae. The neutron star itself is not affected by the explosion and therefore the nuclear reactions in the accreted layer can proceed longer than in an explosion. This allows to establish an rp-process. It will continue until either all free protons are used up or the burning layer has expanded due to the increase in temperature and its density falls below the one required for the nuclear reactions.<ref name=\"schatz\" />\n\nIt was shown that the properties of [[X-ray burster|X-ray bursts]] in the [[Milky Way]] can be explained by an rp-process on the surface of accreting neutron stars.<ref name=\"x-bursts\">S.

Only if this is the case can such objects be considered as possible sources of p-nuclei. Even if this is corroborated, the demonstrated endpoint of the rp-process limits the production to the light p-nuclei (which are underproduced in core-collapse supernovae).<ref name=\"rp-end\" />\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of unsolved problems in physics]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n{{Nuclear_processes}}\n{{supernovae}}\n\n[[Category:Nuclear physics]]\n[[Category:Astrophysics]]\n[[Category:Nucleosynthesis]]\n[[Category:Supernovae]]\n[[Category:Stellar physics]]\n", "name_user": "Tridwoxi", "label": "safe", "comment": "Addingshort description: \"Set of isotopes in nuclear astrophysics\" (Shortdesc helper)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P-nuclei"}
