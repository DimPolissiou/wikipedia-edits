The principal tributaries of the Msta are the [[Berezayka River|Berezayka]] (left), the [[Uver River|Uver]] (right), and the [[Kholova River|Kholova]] (left). The town of Borovichi and the urban-type settlement of [[Lyubytino]] are located on the banks of the Msta.\n\nThe source of the Msta is in [[Lake Mstino]] in the [[Valdai Hills]] immediately north of the town of [[Vyshny Volochyok]].

The band has stated that they also wanted their CDs to be placed in stores alongside their favorite band, [[Slayer]].  It was at this time that Odadjian passed on his original managerial responsibilities to [[Velvet Hammer Music]].

Achozen's mantra is:\n\n{{quote|Many shall come, only a few shall be Achozen.}}\n\nThe four principal members feel that their unique sound is not only spiritual in nature, but a new genre of \"heavy hip hop,\" not \"rap-metal.\" There are no heavy guitars on the album, but the sound is genre-blending. Most of the Achozen album was recorded at one of Odadjian's two studios and were also produced by him. The bulk of the beats were created by Odadjian (only one or two samples were used on the entire record) who also played live instruments throughout, including bass and sitar. RZA, who contributed his share of beats, Kinetic 9 and the Reverend William Burke sing a majority of the vocals and lyrics, which are, according to Odadjian, \"some of the most innovative, poetic and righteous words and vocals that I've ever heard.\" Odadjian's vocals can also be heard on the AcHoZeN tracks \"''Deuces'',\" ''\"Salute/Sacrifice,\"'' and other songs on the album.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=105342 |title=Blabbermouth: System of a Down Bassist to Perform at WeThePeople Festival |publisher=Roadrunnerrecords.com |accessdate=2011-07-18 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110531213225/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=105342 |archivedate=May 31, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n[[File:OdadjianDiggs.jpg|thumb|left|Shavo and The Rza performing live music from Achozen.]]\nAchozen's debut features an eclectic array of guest performers that includes Funk-master [[George Clinton (musician)|George Clinton]], [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]]' guitarist [[John Frusciante]], Wu-Tang affiliate [[Killah Priest]], Wu-Tang founding member [[GZA]], emcee [[Sick Jacken]] from [[Psycho Realm]], and Angolan rapper Leggezin Fin.\n\nThe music of Achozen is described by one writer as a cosmic experience in hip-hop:\n\n{{quote|AcHoZeN is space hip hop, rap without a coast or even a planet.

Odadjian is also credited with the musical scoring of the film, alongside The Rza and Hans Zimmer. He originally used [[Gibson Thunderbird]] basses, a [[Fender Jazz Bass]], an [[Ibanez]] BTB bass guitar, and a [[Music Man StingRay]], but has since moved on to [[Warwick (company)|Warwick]] basses.\n\n== Early life ==\nOdadjian was born in [[Yerevan]], [[Armenian Soviet Socialist Republic|Armenian SSR]], [[Soviet Union|USSR]].

Odadjian had met them in a recording studio, where he was recording with his own band. The two members called upon him for assistance, and he became manager of the band. Odadjian says in an early interview that securing System's first local gig was a struggle:\n\n{{quote| I was managing the band and we had no demo [tape], we had no money, but we wanted to play a show.

The band has stated that they also wanted their CDs to be placed in stores alongside their favorite band, [[Slayer]].  It was at this time that Odadjian passed on his original managerial responsibilities to [[Velvet Hammer Music]].

Achozen's mantra is:\n\n{{quote|Many shall come, only a few shall be Achozen.}}\n\nThe four principal members feel that their unique sound is not only spiritual in nature, but a new genre of \"heavy hip hop,\" not \"rap-metal.\" There are no heavy guitars on the album, but the sound is genre-blending. Most of the Achozen album was recorded at one of Odadjian's two studios and were also produced by him. The bulk of the beats were created by Odadjian (only one or two samples were used on the entire record) who also played live instruments throughout, including bass and sitar. RZA, who contributed his share of beats, Kinetic 9 and the Reverend William Burke sing a majority of the vocals and lyrics, which are, according to Odadjian, \"some of the most innovative, poetic and righteous words and vocals that I've ever heard.\" Odadjian's vocals can also be heard on the AcHoZeN tracks \"''Deuces'',\" ''\"Salute/Sacrifice,\"'' and other songs on the album.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=105342 |title=Blabbermouth: System of a Down Bassist to Perform at WeThePeople Festival |publisher=Roadrunnerrecords.com |accessdate=2011-07-18 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110531213225/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&newsitemID=105342 |archivedate=May 31, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>\n\n[[File:OdadjianDiggs.jpg|thumb|left|Shavo and The Rza performing live music from Achozen.]]\nAchozen's debut features an eclectic array of guest performers that includes Funk-master [[George Clinton (musician)|George Clinton]], [[Red Hot Chili Peppers]]' guitarist [[John Frusciante]], Wu-Tang affiliate [[Killah Priest]], Wu-Tang founding member [[GZA]], emcee [[Sick Jacken]] from [[Psycho Realm]], and Angolan rapper Leggezin Fin.\n\nThe music of Achozen is described by one writer as a cosmic experience in hip-hop:\n\n{{quote|AcHoZeN is space hip hop, rap without a coast or even a planet.

He also made a cameo as Hansel's Posse member in the film [[Zoolander]].\n\nIn 2006, Odadjian starred in the critically acclaimed film \"[[Screamers (2006 film)|Screamers]]\", a documentary by internationally known director [[Carla Garapedian]]. The film follows Odadjian and the rest of the rock band [[System of a Down]] as they tour Europe and the US, pointing out the horrors of modern genocide that began in Armenia in 1915 up through [[Darfur]] today.<ref>{{IMDb title|823668|Screamers}}</ref>\n\n== Other work ==\n\n=== Painting and artwork ===\n[[File:OdadjianOzzfest.jpg|thumb|left|One of Odadjian's 26 abstract paintings that hung as a backdrop for Ozzfest 2006.]]\nOdadjian is an avid and passionate painter outside of music.

(Stage design in System of a Down performances is also attributed to Odadjian). One critic wrote of the Ozzfest performance:\n\n{{quote|Where most of the other bands on the bill stuck to the traditional metal imagery of skulls, blood and gore to enhance their stages, System went the other way, offering a series of abstract paintings that swished across an enormous video screen.<ref>{{cite web|author=PAUL SAITOWITZThe Press-Enterprise |url=http://www.pe.com/entertainment/stories/PE_Fea_Local_D_ozzfestrev10.260fed4.html |title=System of a Down Rises Above the Dross |publisher=Pe.com |date=July 10, 2006 |accessdate=2011-07-18}}</ref>}}\n\nEach of Odadjian's paintings for the 2006 Ozzfest performance were hand-picked by Odadjian himself.

This shutdown came after the launch of [[Movies Anywhere]] over a year earlier, along with Fox, Universal, Lionsgate, Paramount, and Warner Bros. beginning to drop out of issuing new UV rights for their films during that time period.<ref>{{cite web|url= https://variety.com/2019/digital/news/ultraviolet-shutting-down-1203123898/ |title=Ultraviolet Cloud Movie Locker to Shut Down (EXCLUSIVE) | website= Variety.com |first= Janko| last=  Roettgers| date= 2019-01-30}}</ref>\n\n==Operation==\nTo use UltraViolet, consumers needed to create a free UltraViolet account, either through a participating UltraViolet service provider, or through the official UltraViolet website. An UltraViolet account was a digital rights locker where licenses for purchased content were stored and managed irrespective of the [[point of sale]]. The Ultraviolet account holder was allowed to share their library with 5 other users, which were called members.\n\nConsumers could acquire UltraViolet rights by purchasing a physical disc that included an UltraViolet activation code, by purchasing a movie directly from an electronic retailer (a.k.a. EST, or [[Electronic sell-through]]), or by using a '''disc to digital''' service (D2D). Disc to digital services allowed consumers to insert a DVD or [[Blu-ray]] into their computer's disc drive, scan it to verify ownership, and then add it to their UltraViolet collection for a fee. Several retailers including [[Vudu]] and [[CinemaNow]] offered this service. [[Flixster]] had been offering a D2D service as well, but it was suspended once [[Fandango (ticket service)|Fandango]] acquired Flixster in early 2016 and another independent [[Video on demand|movie streaming service]], M-GO.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Rotten Tomatoes and Flixster Acquired By Fandango|url = https://www.slashfilm.com/rotten-tomatoes-fandango-flixster/ |website = Slashfilm.com | date= February 17, 2016| first= Peter | last= Sciretta |access-date = October 30, 2017|language = en-US}}</ref>\n\nConsumers could then stream or download their UltraViolet content from any participating retailer. Former participating retailers are listed in the table below.\n\nThe UltraViolet digital locker did not store video files, and was not a \"cloud storage\" platform. Only the rights for purchased content were stored on the service. UltraViolet only coordinated and managed the licenses for each account, but not the content itself. By creating a digital-rights locker rather than a digital media storage locker, UltraViolet bypassed the cost of storage and bandwidth used when the media is accessed and passed that cost on to various service providers.\n\n==Content partners==\n5 of the [[Major film studio#Current|\"Big Six\"]] [[major film studio]]s and [[Major film studio#Mini-majors|\"mini-major\"]] [[Lionsgate]] were members of DECE, and released their content with UltraViolet rights.<ref>{{cite web|title=Alliance Members|url=http://www.uvvu.com/alliance-members.php|publisher=Digital Entertainment Content Ecosystem (DECE)|accessdate=March 31, 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120918223404/http://www.uvvu.com/alliance-members.php|archivedate=September 18, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Other minor film and television studios released their programming and movies with UltraViolet rights, but were not DECE members.\n\n* Major film studios\n** [[Sony Pictures Entertainment]] (films released for digital distribution before August 2019)\n** [[Universal Studios]]  (films released for digital distribution before January 2018)\n** [[Paramount Pictures]] (films released for digital distribution before December 2018)\n** [[Warner Bros.

On February 25, 2014, Disney launched a competing digital movie locker system called [[Movies Anywhere#History|Disney Movies Anywhere]] that allowed any Disney movie purchased or redeemed at any participating provider to be played using all other DMA providers. DMA providers included iTunes, Vudu, Google Play, Amazon Video, and Microsoft Movies & TV. On October 12, 2017, Disney Movies Anywhere was expanded to include movies from a number of non-Disney studios, thus forming a full-fledged UltraViolet competitor. This service is now called [[Movies Anywhere]] to reflect the expanded scope of content.\n\n==UltraViolet digital retailers==\nUltraViolet content was available from several movie streaming services.<ref>{{cite web|title=UV Demystified|url=http://www.uvdemystified.com/uvfaq.html#1.7.1}}</ref>. Some services offered downloads that could be saved to PCs, tablets, gaming consoles, or phones for offline viewing.

They had their own proprietary video formats, and they were not cross-platform. They had to be downloaded and played within their own proprietary PC, Mac, iOS, or Android apps.\n\nThe Ultraviolet Common File Format (CFF) was planned, but never launched, by DECE to allow downloaded video files to be copied between devices, stored on physical media (e.g. DVDs, [[SD card]]s, [[flash memory]]) or online backup services. They were designed to be playable on any UltraViolet authorized device (e.g. Blu-ray, streaming media player, Smart TV', or mobile device) or software player registered to the household Ultraviolet library.\n\nA 2015 simplification of the UV ecosystem made the Common File Format optional for studios and streaming providers. CFF was never supported by any retailers.\n\n==Selected DRM technologies==\n\nUltraViolet Streaming providers were free to choose whatever [[Digital rights management|DRM technologies]] technologies they wanted to use for streaming and downloads.\n\n[[DECE]] approved six [[Digital rights management|DRM technologies]] for use in conjunction with a proposed common file format, which was never launched.\n\nThe selected DRM technologies were:\n* Google [[Widevine]] DRM, chosen for its strong position on set-top boxes\n* [[Marlin (DRM)|Marlin DRM]], chosen for its compatibility with many [[Connected TV]]s\n* OMA [[OMA DRM|CMLA-OMA v2]], chosen for its strong position on mobile devices\n* Microsoft [[PlayReady]], chosen for its wide availability on PC and CE devices\n* Adobe Primetime DRM, chosen for its wide availability on PC devices\n* DivX DRM<ref>http://www.rovicorp.com/company/press-releases/2013/1/7/divx-plus-str-drm-approved-for-ultraviolet-services.html</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===2010===\n\nIn September, Mitch Singer, the President of [[Digital Entertainment Content Ecosystem|DECE]], announced the upcoming launch of the \"UltraViolet\" system in an interview with Home Media Magazine.<ref>{{cite web|title=Six Questions: Ultraviolet\u2019s Mitch Singer|url=http://www.homemediamagazine.com/electronic-delivery/six-questions-ultraviolet%E2%80%99s-mitch-singer-20510|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717234132/http://www.homemediamagazine.com/electronic-delivery/six-questions-ultraviolet%E2%80%99s-mitch-singer-20510|archivedate=July 17, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n===2011===\n\nIn January, a number of major film studios announced support for UltraViolet.

An UltraViolet account was a digital rights locker where licenses for purchased content were stored and managed irrespective of the [[point of sale]]. The Ultraviolet account holder was allowed to share their library with 5 other users, which were called members.\n\nConsumers could acquire UltraViolet rights by purchasing a physical disc that included an UltraViolet activation code, by purchasing a movie directly from an electronic retailer (a.k.a. EST, or [[Electronic sell-through]]), or by using a '''disc to digital''' service (D2D). Disc to digital services allowed consumers to insert a DVD or [[Blu-ray]] into their computer's disc drive, scan it to verify ownership, and then add it to their UltraViolet collection for a fee. Several retailers including [[Vudu]] and [[CinemaNow]] offered this service. [[Flixster]] had been offering a D2D service as well, but it was suspended once [[Fandango (ticket service)|Fandango]] acquired Flixster in early 2016 and another independent [[Video on demand|movie streaming service]], M-GO.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Rotten Tomatoes and Flixster Acquired By Fandango|url = https://www.slashfilm.com/rotten-tomatoes-fandango-flixster/ |website = Slashfilm.com | date= February 17, 2016| first= Peter | last= Sciretta |access-date = October 30, 2017|language = en-US}}</ref>\n\nConsumers could then stream or download their UltraViolet content from any participating retailer. Former participating retailers are listed in the table below.\n\nThe UltraViolet digital locker did not store video files, and was not a \"cloud storage\" platform. Only the rights for purchased content were stored on the service. UltraViolet only coordinated and managed the licenses for each account, but not the content itself. By creating a digital-rights locker rather than a digital media storage locker, UltraViolet bypassed the cost of storage and bandwidth used when the media is accessed and passed that cost on to various service providers.\n\n==Content partners==\n5 of the [[Major film studio#Current|\"Big Six\"]] [[major film studio]]s and [[Major film studio#Mini-majors|\"mini-major\"]] [[Lionsgate]] were members of DECE, and released their content with UltraViolet rights.<ref>{{cite web|title=Alliance Members|url=http://www.uvvu.com/alliance-members.php|publisher=Digital Entertainment Content Ecosystem (DECE)|accessdate=March 31, 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120918223404/http://www.uvvu.com/alliance-members.php|archivedate=September 18, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Other minor film and television studios released their programming and movies with UltraViolet rights, but were not DECE members.\n\n* Major film studios\n** [[Sony Pictures Entertainment]] (films released for digital distribution before August 2019)\n** [[Universal Studios]]  (films released for digital distribution before January 2018)\n** [[Paramount Pictures]] (films released for digital distribution before December 2018)\n** [[Warner Bros.

On February 25, 2014, Disney launched a competing digital movie locker system called [[Movies Anywhere#History|Disney Movies Anywhere]] that allowed any Disney movie purchased or redeemed at any participating provider to be played using all other DMA providers. DMA providers included iTunes, Vudu, Google Play, Amazon Video, and Microsoft Movies & TV. On October 12, 2017, Disney Movies Anywhere was expanded to include movies from a number of non-Disney studios, thus forming a full-fledged UltraViolet competitor. This service is now called [[Movies Anywhere]] to reflect the expanded scope of content.\n\n==UltraViolet digital retailers==\nUltraViolet content was available from several movie streaming services.<ref>{{cite web|title=UV Demystified|url=http://www.uvdemystified.com/uvfaq.html#1.7.1}}</ref>.

They had their own proprietary video formats, and they were not cross-platform. They had to be downloaded and played within their own proprietary PC, Mac, iOS, or Android apps.\n\nThe Ultraviolet Common File Format (CFF) was planned, but never launched, by DECE to allow downloaded video files to be copied between devices, stored on physical media (e.g. DVDs, [[SD card]]s, [[flash memory]]) or online backup services. They were designed to be playable on any UltraViolet authorized device (e.g. Blu-ray, streaming media player, Smart TV', or mobile device) or software player registered to the household Ultraviolet library.\n\nA 2015 simplification of the UV ecosystem made the Common File Format optional for studios and streaming providers. CFF was never supported by any retailers.\n\n==Selected DRM technologies==\n\nUltraViolet Streaming providers were free to choose whatever [[Digital rights management|DRM technologies]] technologies they wanted to use for streaming and downloads.\n\n[[DECE]] approved six [[Digital rights management|DRM technologies]] for use in conjunction with a proposed common file format, which was never launched.\n\nThe selected DRM technologies were:\n* Google [[Widevine]] DRM, chosen for its strong position on set-top boxes\n* [[Marlin (DRM)|Marlin DRM]], chosen for its compatibility with many [[Connected TV]]s\n* OMA [[OMA DRM|CMLA-OMA v2]], chosen for its strong position on mobile devices\n* Microsoft [[PlayReady]], chosen for its wide availability on PC and CE devices\n* Adobe Primetime DRM, chosen for its wide availability on PC devices\n* DivX DRM<ref>http://www.rovicorp.com/company/press-releases/2013/1/7/divx-plus-str-drm-approved-for-ultraviolet-services.html</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===2010===\n\nIn September, Mitch Singer, the President of [[Digital Entertainment Content Ecosystem|DECE]], announced the upcoming launch of the \"UltraViolet\" system in an interview with Home Media Magazine.<ref>{{cite web|title=Six Questions: Ultraviolet\u2019s Mitch Singer|url=http://www.homemediamagazine.com/electronic-delivery/six-questions-ultraviolet%E2%80%99s-mitch-singer-20510|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717234132/http://www.homemediamagazine.com/electronic-delivery/six-questions-ultraviolet%E2%80%99s-mitch-singer-20510|archivedate=July 17, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref>\n\n===2011===\n\nIn January, a number of major film studios announced support for UltraViolet.
