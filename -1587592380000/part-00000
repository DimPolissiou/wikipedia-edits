That summer he worked for the [[Department of Marine and Fisheries]] on the Great Lakes as a marine fire fighter.{{sfn|Koennecke|2008}}\n\n==Military career==\n\nFollowing the outbreak of [[World War I]], Pegahmagabow volunteered for service with the [[Canadian Expeditionary Force]] in August 1914,<ref name= \"Schmalz p. 301\" /> despite Canadian government discrimination that initially excluded minorities.{{sfn|Koennecke|2008}}  He was posted to the [[The Algonquin Regiment|23rd Canadian Regiment (Northern Pioneers)]].

During the fighting, Pegahmagabow's battalion was given the task of launching an attack at Passchendaele.<ref name= \"Veterans Affairs Canada p. \"/> By this time, he had been promoted to the rank of [[corporal]] and during the battle he was recorded playing an important role as a link between the units on the 1st Battalion's flank. When the battalion's reinforcements became lost, Pegahmagabow was instrumental in guiding them and ensuring that they reached their allocated spot in the line.<ref name= \"Veterans Affairs Canada p. \"/>\n\nOn August 30, 1918, during the [[Hundred Days Offensive|Battle of the Scarpe]], Pegahmagabow was involved in fighting off a German attack at Orix Trench near Upton Wood. His company was almost out of ammunition and in danger of being surrounded.  Pegahmagabow braved heavy machine gun and rifle fire by going into [[no-man's land]] and brought back enough ammunition to enable his post to carry on and assist in repulsing heavy enemy counter-attacks.<ref name= \"Veterans Affairs Canada p. \"/> For these efforts he received a second Bar to his Military Medal,<ref name= \"Veterans Affairs Canada p. \"/> becoming one of only 39 Canadians to receive this honour.<ref name= \"Veterans Affairs Canada p. \"/><ref name= \"Bethune p. \">{{harvnb|Bethune|2005|p=}}</ref>\n\nThe war ended in November 1918 and in 1919 Pegahmagabow was invalided back to Canada.

In 1933 the [[Indian and Northern Affairs Canada|Department of Indian Affairs (DIA)]] changed its policies and forbade First Nation chiefs from corresponding with the DIA.  They directed that all correspondence, as of the spring of 1933, go through the [[Indian Agent (Canada)|Indian Agent]].<ref name= \"Brownlie p. ix\"/>  This gave huge power to the Agent, something that grated on Pegahmagabow, who did not get along with his Indian Agent, John Daly.<ref name= \"Brownlie p. ix\">{{harvnb|Brownlie|2003|p=ix}}</ref>  First Nation members who served in the army during World War I were particularly active as political activists.  They had travelled the world, earned the respect of the comrades in the trenches, and refused to be sidelined by the newly empowered Indian Agent.  Historian Paul Williams termed these advocates \"returned soldier chiefs\", and singled out a few, including Pegahmagabow, as being especially active.<ref name= \"Brownlie p. 57\">{{harvnb|Brownlie|2003|p=57}}</ref>  This caused intense disagreements with Daly and eventually led to Pegahmagabow being deposed as chief.<ref name= \"Brownlie p. 63\"/>  Daly and other agents who came in contact with Pegahmagabow were incredibly frustrated by his attempts, in his words, to free his people from \"white slavery\".<ref name= \"Brownlie p. 65\">{{harvnb|Brownlie|2003|p=65}}</ref>  The Indian agents labelled him a \"mental case\" and strove to sideline him and his supporters.<ref name= \"Brownlie p. 65\"/>\n\nIn addition to the power struggle between the Indian council and the DIA with which Pegahmagabow took issue, he was a constant agitator over the islands in [[Georgian Bay]] of the [[Wyandot people|Huron]].  The Regional First Nation governments claimed the islands as their own and Pegahmagabow and other chiefs tried in vain to get recognition of their status.<ref name= \"Brownlie p. 98\">{{harvnb|Brownlie|2003|p=98}}</ref>\n\nDuring [[World War II]] Pegahmagabow worked as a guard at a munitions plant near [[Nobel, Ontario]], and was a Sergeant-major in the local militia.<ref name= \"Mackey p. \">{{harvnb|Mackey|2003|p=}}</ref>  In 1943, he became the Supreme Chief of the [[Native Independent Government]], an early First Nations organization.<ref name= \"Mackey p. \"/>\n\n==Family and legacy==\n\n{{wikiquote|Francis Pegahmagabow}}\n\nA married father of six children, Pegahmagabow died on the Parry Island reserve in 1952 at the age of 61.

That summer he worked for the [[Department of Marine and Fisheries]] on the Great Lakes as a marine fire fighter.{{sfn|Koennecke|2008}}\n\n==Military career==\n\nFollowing the outbreak of [[World War I]], Pegahmagabow volunteered for service with the [[Canadian Expeditionary Force]] in August 1914,<ref name= \"Schmalz p. 301\" /> despite Canadian government discrimination that initially excluded minorities.{{sfn|Koennecke|2008}}  He was posted to the [[The Algonquin Regiment|23rd Canadian Regiment (Northern Pioneers)]].

During the fighting, Pegahmagabow's battalion was given the task of launching an attack at Passchendaele.<ref name= \"Veterans Affairs Canada p. \"/> By this time, he had been promoted to the rank of [[corporal]] and during the battle he was recorded playing an important role as a link between the units on the 1st Battalion's flank. When the battalion's reinforcements became lost, Pegahmagabow was instrumental in guiding them and ensuring that they reached their allocated spot in the line.<ref name= \"Veterans Affairs Canada p. \"/>\n\nOn August 30, 1918, during the [[Hundred Days Offensive|Battle of the Scarpe]], Pegahmagabow was involved in fighting off a German attack at Orix Trench near Upton Wood. His company was almost out of ammunition and in danger of being surrounded.

In 1933 the [[Indian and Northern Affairs Canada|Department of Indian Affairs (DIA)]] changed its policies and forbade First Nation chiefs from corresponding with the DIA.  They directed that all correspondence, as of the spring of 1933, go through the [[Indian Agent (Canada)|Indian Agent]].<ref name= \"Brownlie p. ix\"/>  This gave huge power to the Agent, something that grated on Pegahmagabow, who did not get along with his Indian Agent, John Daly.<ref name= \"Brownlie p. ix\">{{harvnb|Brownlie|2003|p=ix}}</ref>  First Nation members who served in the army during World War I were particularly active as political activists.

Historian Paul Williams termed these advocates \"returned soldier chiefs\", and singled out a few, including Pegahmagabow, as being especially active.<ref name= \"Brownlie p. 57\">{{harvnb|Brownlie|2003|p=57}}</ref>  This caused intense disagreements with Daly and eventually led to Pegahmagabow being deposed as chief.<ref name= \"Brownlie p. 63\"/>  Daly and other agents who came in contact with Pegahmagabow were incredibly frustrated by his attempts, in his words, to free his people from \"white slavery\".<ref name= \"Brownlie p. 65\">{{harvnb|Brownlie|2003|p=65}}</ref>  The Indian agents labelled him a \"mental case\" and strove to sideline him and his supporters.<ref name= \"Brownlie p. 65\"/>\n\nIn addition to the power struggle between the Indian council and the DIA with which Pegahmagabow took issue, he was a constant agitator over the islands in [[Georgian Bay]] of the [[Wyandot people|Huron]].  The Regional First Nation governments claimed the islands as their own and Pegahmagabow and other chiefs tried in vain to get recognition of their status.<ref name= \"Brownlie p. 98\">{{harvnb|Brownlie|2003|p=98}}</ref>\n\nDuring [[World War II]] Pegahmagabow worked as a guard at a munitions plant near [[Nobel, Ontario]], and was a Sergeant-major in the local militia.<ref name= \"Mackey p. \">{{harvnb|Mackey|2003|p=}}</ref>  In 1943, he became the Supreme Chief of the [[Native Independent Government]], an early First Nations organization.<ref name= \"Mackey p. \"/>\n\n==Family and legacy==\n\n{{wikiquote|Francis Pegahmagabow}}\n\nA married father of six children, Pegahmagabow died on the Parry Island reserve in 1952 at the age of 61.

It was a co-production of [[Fireworks Entertainment]] (Canada), [[Tribune Entertainment]] (United States), [[M\u00e9tropole T\u00e9l\u00e9vision|M6]] (France), Amy International (UK), and Tele M\u00fcnchen (Germany). The series premise was inspired by the work of modern-day explorer [[Barry Clifford]].\n\nDistribution was by syndication throughout the United States and by [[Global Television Network|Global]] in Canada. Following its only season, the episodes were aired in Canada on [[Space (Canadian TV channel)|Space]].\n\n==Series outline==\nThe preamble and voiceover from the opening titles tell the premise of the show:\n\n\"My name is Judson Cross. I've been called everything from a treasure hunter to a thrill seeker, but personally I like to think of myself as a professional explorer. My company is Adventure, Inc. and we're in the business of finding things - things that are priceless, dangerous, sometimes even unexplainable. My crew will go anywhere and risk everything. Adventure really is our business\".\n\nAs he travels along different corners of the world, Cross is accompanied by two partners: Mackenzie ([[Karen Cliche]]) and Gabriel ([[Jesse Nilsson]]).\n\n==Publicity==\n\nFireworks International went into Cannes with Adventure Inc., and with its star Michael Biehn worked the [[Promenade de la Croisette|Croisette]] hard to promote the show.<ref name= HR-October-8-14-2002>Adventure lighting up Cannes by Charles Masters - Hollywood Reporter, 8\u201314 October 2002</ref> Biehn was joined by executive producer [[Gale Ann Hurd]], who had gotten Biehn roles in ''[[The Terminator]]'' and ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]'', both films they had done with Hurd's then-husband [[James Cameron]]. Now divorced, she and Biehn hoped to make a splash with this TV show.\n\nThe show's main character is Judson Cross, a seafaring adventurer-for-hire, and was originally Hurd's idea, based partly on the real-life exploits of her close friend, explorer [[Barry Clifford]], discoverer of the ''[[Whydah Gally]]'' (the world's only authenticated pirate shipwreck).<ref name= EMCC-August-26-2002>Being Hurd by Greg Dudsic - Electronic Media/Crain Communications - 26 August 2002</ref> \"It's not common in television to have a character inspired by real events and real character,\" she said.<ref name= \" EMCC-August-26-2002\"/> The research vessel, ''Vast Explorer'', featured in the show was named in honor of the ship used by Clifford.\n\nHurd maintained that the one big difference between film and television was budgets, and that in relation to her films, Adventure Inc.'s budget was \"a very small percentage.\"<ref name= \" EMCC-August-26-2002\"/> Legendary guerrilla filmmaker [[Roger Corman]] helped Hurd to deliver the series on time and on budget.<ref name= \" EMCC-August-26-2002\"/> \"What I think prepared me for television was my time with Roger Corman, where we neither had time nor money to finish our projects,\" she said. \"Instead of as a negative, though, I've come to see it as a positive thing.\"<ref name= \" EMCC-August-26-2002\"/>\n\n==Cast and characters==\n[[File:Adventure Inc. cast.JPG|right|thumb|250px|Michael Biehn, Jesse Nilsson and Karen Cliche]]\n* [[Michael Biehn]] - Judson Cross\n* [[Karen Cliche]] - Mackenzie Previn\n* [[Jesse Nilsson]] - Gabriel Patterson\n{{clear}}\n\n==Notable actors appearing==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Christien Anholt]]\n* [[Steve Bacic]]\n* [[Noel Clarke]]\n* [[Vincent Corazza]]\n* [[Ellen Dubin]]\n* [[Von Flores]]\n* [[Charlotte Lucas]]\n* [[Lisa Marcos]]\n* [[Denis M\u00e9nochet]]\n* [[Deborah Odell]]\n* [[Eva Pope]]\n* [[John Ralston (actor)|John Ralston]]\n* [[Carlo Rota]]\n* [[Alice Taglioni]]\n* [[Christopher Villiers]]\n* [[Gary Webster (actor)|Gary Webster]]\n* [[Chris Geere]]\n{{colend}}\n\n==Television==\nThe show was first broadcast in the US from 30 September 2002 to 12 May 2003.

The worldwide locations were done by using establishing shots with Toronto standing in for many cities; Bristol stood in for London.\n*When filming in Canada, the show used the ship ''Vast Explorer'' and in Marseille ''Janus II''.\n*Jesse Nilsson died from pneumonia related heart failure on 25 April 2003 in North York, Ontario Canada before the final episode was broadcast. A tribute was added to the last few frames of said episode: \"In memory of Jesse Nilsson 1977-2003.\" Nilsson's passing led to the cancellation of the series.

It was a co-production of [[Fireworks Entertainment]] (Canada), [[Tribune Entertainment]] (United States), [[M\u00e9tropole T\u00e9l\u00e9vision|M6]] (France), Amy International (UK), and Tele M\u00fcnchen (Germany). The series premise was inspired by the work of modern-day explorer [[Barry Clifford]].\n\nDistribution was by syndication throughout the United States and by [[Global Television Network|Global]] in Canada. Following its only season, the episodes were aired in Canada on [[Space (Canadian TV channel)|Space]].\n\n==Series outline==\nThe preamble and voiceover from the opening titles tell the premise of the show:\n\n\"My name is Judson Cross. I've been called everything from a treasure hunter to a thrill seeker, but personally I like to think of myself as a professional explorer. My company is Adventure, Inc. and we're in the business of finding things - things that are priceless, dangerous, sometimes even unexplainable. My crew will go anywhere and risk everything. Adventure really is our business\".\n\nAs he travels along different corners of the world, Cross is accompanied by two partners: Mackenzie ([[Karen Cliche]]) and Gabriel ([[Jesse Nilsson]]).\n\n==Publicity==\n\nFireworks International went into Cannes with Adventure Inc., and with its star Michael Biehn worked the [[Promenade de la Croisette|Croisette]] hard to promote the show.<ref name= HR-October-8-14-2002>Adventure lighting up Cannes by Charles Masters - Hollywood Reporter, 8\u201314 October 2002</ref> Biehn was joined by executive producer [[Gale Ann Hurd]], who had gotten Biehn roles in ''[[The Terminator]]'' and ''[[Aliens (film)|Aliens]]'', both films they had done with Hurd's then-husband [[James Cameron]]. Now divorced, she and Biehn hoped to make a splash with this TV show.\n\nThe show's main character is Judson Cross, a seafaring adventurer-for-hire, and was originally Hurd's idea, based partly on the real-life exploits of her close friend, explorer [[Barry Clifford]], discoverer of the ''[[Whydah Gally]]'' (the world's only authenticated pirate shipwreck).<ref name= EMCC-August-26-2002>Being Hurd by Greg Dudsic - Electronic Media/Crain Communications - 26 August 2002</ref> \"It's not common in television to have a character inspired by real events and real character,\" she said.<ref name= \" EMCC-August-26-2002\"/> The research vessel, ''Vast Explorer'', featured in the show was named in honor of the ship used by Clifford.\n\nHurd maintained that the one big difference between film and television was budgets, and that in relation to her films, Adventure Inc.'s budget was \"a very small percentage.\"<ref name= \" EMCC-August-26-2002\"/> Legendary guerrilla filmmaker [[Roger Corman]] helped Hurd to deliver the series on time and on budget.<ref name= \" EMCC-August-26-2002\"/> \"What I think prepared me for television was my time with Roger Corman, where we neither had time nor money to finish our projects,\" she said. \"Instead of as a negative, though, I've come to see it as a positive thing.\"<ref name= \" EMCC-August-26-2002\"/>\n\n==Cast and characters==\n[[File:Adventure Inc. cast.JPG|right|thumb|250px|Michael Biehn, Jesse Nilsson and Karen Cliche]]\n* [[Michael Biehn]] - Judson Cross\n* [[Karen Cliche]] - Mackenzie Previn\n* [[Jesse Nilsson]] - Gabriel Patterson\n{{clear}}\n\n==Notable actors appearing==\n{{colbegin}}\n* [[Christien Anholt]]\n* [[Steve Bacic]]\n* [[Noel Clarke]]\n* [[Vincent Corazza]]\n* [[Ellen Dubin]]\n* [[Von Flores]]\n* [[Charlotte Lucas]]\n* [[Lisa Marcos]]\n* [[Denis M\u00e9nochet]]\n* [[Deborah Odell]]\n* [[Eva Pope]]\n* [[John Ralston (actor)|John Ralston]]\n* [[Carlo Rota]]\n* [[Alice Taglioni]]\n* [[Christopher Villiers]]\n* [[Gary Webster]]\n* [[Chris Geere]]\n{{colend}}\n\n==Television==\nThe show was first broadcast in the US from 30 September 2002 to 12 May 2003.

Despite having limited sponsorship for the car at first, Vasser started the season strong with four straight finishes of 4th to 6th place.  Continuing the strong start to 2001, Jimmy was reunited with Target Chip Ganassi Racing driving for them in the Indianapolis 500.  Jimmy ran well and finish 4th place as ChampCar drivers swept the top five spots at the 500.  However, once returning to the ChampCar circuit, back to back crashes in race #5 at Milwaukee and race #6 at Detroit seemed to derail the season as Jimmy finished the final sixteen races of the season with only four more finishes of 5th to 7th.\n\nAfter a disappointing year without even a podium, Vasser was able to secure the seat of the #8 Shell Lola Ford with Rahal Letterman Racing for 2002 which had finished 2nd in ChampCar points the previous season.  In the Shell car, Vasser showed some muscle at Long Beach scoring the pole, leading laps late, and finishing 2nd behind Michael Andretti.  Vasser and Rahal Letterman also crossed over into the IRL where they ran the IRL race in Fontana to prepare for Indianapolis and then the Indianapolis 500.  Success was limited as Vasser scored only a 9th at Fontana and a gearbox failure cut short his Indy 500 race.  Vasser's 2002 season in the Shell car was much improved over the previous year with Patrick Racing.  Vasser really finished the year strong with scoring points in each of the final nine races including a podium at Miami and a dominating win at Fontana after a late-race pass of Michael Andretti.  Vasser's Fontana win was to be the final win of his ChampCar career.\n\nWithout sponsorship at Rahal for 2003, Vasser had to look for opportunities with other teams and without many seats available for the 38-year-old he ended up with [[Stefan Johansson]]'s startup American Spirit team.  The team was not fully funded and they ran the Reynard chassis which were not up to the pace of the current Lola chassis cars.  Additionally, Reynard had gone bankrupt so further development of the chassis had to be taken on by the teams so the performance gap to the Lolas continue to widen during the season.  Except for a couple of fourth-place finishes, leading 15 laps at Cleveland, and podium at Surfer's Paradise in a wet/dry race the season was not very successful as rookie teammate Ryan Hunter-Reay was outpacing Vasser.  Vasser reunited with Rahal Letterman for his final run at an Indianapolis 500 win but was again sidelined with gearbox failure during the race.\n\nIn 2004 he became co-owner of PKV Racing (later renamed to KV Racing Technology) along with [[Dan Pettit]] and [[Kevin Kalkhoven]] and was a driver for the team. In 2004, he broke the modern CART\u2013Champ Car record for the most consecutive starts.<ref>{{cite news|last=Graves|first=Gary|title=Champ Car's Vasser revved up to break record|work=USA Today|date=2004-08-26|url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/motor/champ/2004-08-26-vasser_x.htm|accessdate=2010-01-23}}</ref> Vasser retired from open wheel racing in 2006, but remains active in his ownership role.

He has raced in the event on a one-off basis a few times since, finishing as high as fourth in the 2001 race.\n\nVasser won four races in 1996 and did enough to maintain a lead in the standings for most of the season, clinching the championship at the season's final race.<ref>{{cite news|last=Harris|first=Mike|title=Zanardi wins race, but Vasser takes title|work=The Modesto Bee|agency=Associated Press|date=1996-09-09|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=7s4qAAAAIBAJ&sjid=YdUFAAAAIBAJ&pg=1057,5011431&dq=jimmy+vasser&hl=en|accessdate=2010-01-23}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> Teammate [[Alex Zanardi]] outperformed him over the next two years, winning the points championship both years.<ref>{{cite news|title=Ganassi changes drivers|work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|agency=Associated Press|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=G4cNAAAAIBAJ&sjid=bW8DAAAAIBAJ&pg=6663,5714150&dq=jimmy+vasser&hl=en|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120715192926/http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=G4cNAAAAIBAJ&sjid=bW8DAAAAIBAJ&pg=6663,5714150&dq=jimmy+vasser&hl=en|url-status=dead|archive-date=2012-07-15|accessdate=2010-01-23}} </ref> Vasser teamed with [[Juan Pablo Montoya]] in 1999, finishing ninth in the points standings. In 2000, his last year with Chip Ganassi Racing, Vasser won the Houston Grand Prix for his first victory since 1998.<ref>{{cite web|title=Vasser ends drought on streets of Houston|publisher=ESPN.

Despite having limited sponsorship for the car at first, Vasser started the season strong with four straight finishes of 4th to 6th place.  Continuing the strong start to 2001, Jimmy was reunited with Target Chip Ganassi Racing driving for them in the Indianapolis 500.  Jimmy ran well and finish 4th place as ChampCar drivers swept the top five spots at the 500.  However, once returning to the ChampCar circuit, back to back crashes in race #5 at Milwaukee and race #6 at Detroit seemed to derail the season as Jimmy finished the final sixteen races of the season with only four more finishes of 5th to 7th.\n\nAfter a disappointing year without even a podium, Vasser was able to secure the seat of the #8 Shell Lola Ford with Rahal Letterman Racing for 2002 which had finished 2nd in ChampCar points the previous season.  In the Shell car, Vasser showed some muscle at Long Beach scoring the pole, leading laps late, and finishing 2nd behind Michael Andretti.  Vasser and Rahal Letterman also crossed over into the IRL where they ran the IRL race in Fontana to prepare for Indianapolis and then the Indianapolis 500.  Success was limited as Vasser scored only a 9th at Fontana and a gearbox failure cut short his Indy 500 race.  Vasser's 2002 season in the Shell car was much improved over the previous year with Patrick Racing.  Vasser really finished the year strong with scoring points in each of the final nine races including a podium at Miami and a dominating win at Fontana after a late-race pass of Michael Andretti.  Vasser's Fontana win was to be the final win of his ChampCar career.\n\nWithout sponsorship at Rahal for 2003, Vasser had to look for opportunities with other teams and without many seats available for the 38-year-old he ended up with [[Stefan Johansson]]'s startup American Spirit team.  The team was not fully funded and they ran the Reynard chassis which were not up to the pace of the current Lola chassis cars.  Additionally, Reynard had gone bankrupt so further development of the chassis had to be taken on by the teams so the performance gap to the Lolas continue to widen during the season.  Except for a couple of fourth-place finishes, leading 15 laps at Cleveland, and podium at Surfer's Paradise in a wet/dry race the season was not very successful as rookie teammate Ryan Hunter-Reay was outpacing Vasser.  Vasser reunited with Rahal Letterman for his final run at an Indianapolis 500 win but was again sidelined with gearbox failure during the race.\n\nIn 2004 he became co-owner of PKV Racing (later renamed to KV Racing Technology) along with [[Dan Pettit]] and [[Kevin Kalkhoven]] and was a driver for the team. In 2004, he broke the modern CART\u2013Champ Car record for the most consecutive starts.<ref>{{cite news|last=Graves|first=Gary|title=Champ Car's Vasser revved up to break record|work=USA Today|date=2004-08-26|url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/motor/champ/2004-08-26-vasser_x.htm|accessdate=2010-01-23}}</ref> Vasser retired from open wheel racing in 2006, but remains active in his ownership role.

In 2007, he again drove for the renamed [[GAINSCO/Bob Stallings Racing]] at the 24 Hours of Daytona, and on Sept. 4, 2007, it was announced that he would return to the team for the season-ending Sunchaser 1000&nbsp;km. Vasser drove again for Stallings' team beginning at Laguna Seca in May 2008, pairing with fellow Champ Car champion [[Cristiano da Matta]].\n\nIn 2013, Vasser joined the [[Stadium Super Trucks]] and was scheduled to make his debut at [[Honda Indy Toronto]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.racer.com/paul-tracy-jimmy-vasser-join-robby-gordons-stadium-super-trucks-series-for-toronto/article/302704/|title=Paul Tracy, Jimmy Vasser join Robby Gordon's Stadium SUPER Trucks series for Toronto|work=[[Racer (magazine)|Racer]]|date=2013-07-11|accessdate=2013-12-12}}</ref> However, he was injured prior to the race and was replaced by [[Davey Hamilton]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.racer.com/north-american-racing/item/97533-lofton-wins-stadium-truck-race-1-in-toronto|title=Lofton wins Stadium Truck Race 1 in Toronto|work=[[Racer (magazine)|Racer]]|date=2013-07-13|accessdate=2013-12-12|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140701224421/http://www.racer.com/north-american-racing/item/97533-lofton-wins-stadium-truck-race-1-in-toronto|archive-date=2014-07-01|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\n==Early career ==\n*Won the 1986 [[Formula Ford]] National Championship, SCCA.<ref>{{cite news|last=Taylor|first=Michael|title=A Fascination For Fine Machines|work=San Francisco Chronicle|date=2007-01-07|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2007/01/07/MTG1VNDQ7Q1.DTL|accessdate=2010-01-23}}</ref>\n*Competed in the 1988 Corvette Challenge.\n*Competed in the 1989 and 1990 Pro F-2000 Canadian Championship.

He is much younger than his [[Middle age|middle-aged]] boyfriend and as such Colin's role is almost [[Father|paternal]]. Barry is open about his sexuality to everyone except his volatile father \u2014 and when he is finally told he takes the news so badly that Barry turns [[Heterosexuality|straight]] just to appease him \u2014 although he is never very successful at it.\n\n== Storylines ==\nBarry is introduced in November 1986 as a love interest for [[graphic designer]], [[Colin Russell (EastEnders)|Colin Russell]] ([[Michael Cashman]]). Barry works on Bridge Street market, selling [[Gramophone record|record]]s and other paraphernalia. His family has a reputation for being thuggish; Barry keeps his homosexuality a secret from them, fearing his father's reaction.\n\nPersonality differences between Barry and Colin causes friction in their relationship. Having been imprisoned in 1983 for motor theft, Barry gets involved in crime again in 1987 under [[Nick Cotton]]'s ([[John Altman (actor)|John Altman]]) influence.

When [[Dot Cotton]] ([[June Brown]]) discovers Colin and Barry are in a relationship, she worries they will infect her with AIDS. Her rumours evoke hostility from some members of the community but gradually, they get used to the idea of having gay neighbours and Barry is relieved when his older brother, [[Graham Clark (EastEnders)|Graham]] ([[Gary Webster (actor)|Gary Webster]]), gives his blessing too.\n\nDifferences between Colin and Barry become too great to overcome; Barry's inconsiderate behaviour exasperates Colin and their age gap causes further problems when the police discover that Barry had been under the legal age of sexual consent for homosexuals (21 at the time) when he began living with Colin. The police decide it is their duty to inform Barry's parents. Petrified of his homophobic father, Barry ultimately decides to end his relationship with Colin on New Year's Eve 1987.\n\nTo prevent his father disowning him, Barry attempts to live a heterosexual existence and begins dating a girl named Judy (Joanna Bright), to Colin's dismay. He sets up a mobile disco with [[Ian Beale]] ([[Adam Woodyatt]]), purchasing the equipment from a petty criminal named [[Darren Roberts (EastEnders)|Darren Roberts]] ([[Gary McDonald (actor)|Gary McDonald]]). However, the equipment turns out to be borrowed via [[Hire Purchase]], and when the repayments are not made, the finance company repossesses it all. When Barry is evicted from his flat, he decides to take a job as a DJ on a cruise liner in July 1988. Colin is saddened to see him leave. Barry returns briefly in February 1989 on the day that Colin leaves Walford.

Accepted forms of gender-based violence include in-person contact such as: [[intimate partner violence]], [[street harassment]], [[rape]], and others described in [[violence against women]]. All of these have resulted in the creation of online forms of gender-based violence. Other causes of violence include the practices of [[Online community|Online communities]] and lack of regulations that address gender specific harassment and violence in these communities.\n\n=== Cultural ===\nThe societal acceptance of norms that are deemed \u2018misogynistic\u2019 has a large impact on the prevalence of gender-based violence online. Cultural norms and beliefs are carried from physical communities into online spaces by actors who engage in this behavior in person or who already agree with misogynist ideas.
