He based the word on two things:  1) sensations people experience as they interact with the material world; and 2) the ideas that form in their minds due to those sensations. He conceived \"Ideology\" as a [[liberalism|liberal]] philosophy that would defend individual liberty, property,  [[free markets]], and constitutional limits on state power.  He argues that among these aspects, ideology is the most generic term because the science of ideas also contains the study of their expression and deduction.<ref name = kennedy/>\n\nThe coup that overthrew [[Maximilien Robespierre]] allowed Tracy to pursue his work.<ref name = kennedy>{{cite journal |last=Kennedy |first=Emmet |date=Jul\u2013Sep 1979 |title=\"Ideology\" from Destutt De Tracy to Marx |journal=Journal of the History of Ideas |volume=40 |issue=3 |pages=353\u2013368 |jstor=2709242 |doi=10.2307/2709242|bibcode=1961JHI....22..215C }}</ref><ref name = hart/>\n\nTracy reacted to the terroristic phase of the revolution (during the Napoleonic regime) by trying to work out a rational system of ideas to oppose the irrational mob impulses that had nearly destroyed him.\n\n[[Napoleon Bonaparte]] came to view 'Ideology' a term of abuse, which he often hurled against his liberal foes in Tracy's [[Institutional]]. According to [[Karl Mannheim]]'s historical reconstruction of the shifts in the meaning of ideology, the modern meaning of the word was born when Napoleon used it to describe his opponents as \"the ideologues\". [[Karl Marx]] adopted this negative sense of the term and used it in his writings (he described Tracy as a \"fischbl\u00fctige Bourgeoisdoktrin\u00e4r\", a fishblooded bourgeois doctrine).<ref>De Tracy, Destutt (1801) ''Les \u00c9l\u00e9ments d'id\u00e9ologie'', 3rd ed.

He describes ideology as rather like teaching philosophy by the [[Socratic method]], but without extending the vocabulary beyond what the general reader already possessed, and without the examples from observation that practical science would require. Taine identifies it not just with Destutt De Tracy, but also with his milieu, and includes [[\u00c9tienne Bonnot de Condillac|Condillac]] as one of its precursors. (Destutt de Tracy read the works of Locke and Condillac while he was imprisoned during the [[Reign of Terror]].))\n\nThe term \"ideology\" has [[Euphemism Treadmill|dropped some of its pejorative sting]], and has become a neutral term in the analysis of differing political opinions and views of social groups.<ref>Eagleton, Terry (1991) ''Ideology.

Through this system, ideas become coherent repeated patterns through the subjective ongoing choices that people make. These ideas serve as the seed around which further thought grows.  Believers in ideology range from passive acceptance through fervent advocacy to true belief. According to most recent analysis, ideologies are neither necessarily right nor wrong.\n\nDefinitions, such as by [[Manfred Steger]] and [[Paul James (academic)|Paul James]] emphasize both the issue of patterning and contingent claims to truth:\n\n{{quote|Ideologies are patterned clusters of normatively imbued ideas and concepts, including particular representations of power relations. These conceptual maps help people navigate the complexity of their political universe and carry claims to social truth.<ref>{{cite book |year=2010 |last1=James |first1=Paul |authorlink=Paul James (academic) |last2=Steger |first2=Manfred |title=Globalization and Culture, Vol. 4: Ideologies of Globalism |url=https://www.academia.edu/4510893 |publisher=Sage Publications |location=London}}</ref>}}\n\nThe works of George Walford and Harold Walsby, done under the heading of [[systematic ideology]], are attempts to explore the relationships between ideology and social systems {{Examples|date=February 2019}}.

Minar describes six different ways the word \"ideology\" has been used:\n# As a collection of certain ideas with certain kinds of ''content'', usually normative\n# As the ''form or internal logical structure'' that ideas have within a set\n# By the role ideas play in ''human-social interaction''\n# By the role ideas play in the ''structure of an organization''\n# As meaning, whose purpose is ''persuasion''\n# As the ''locus'' of social interaction\n\nFor [[Willard Mullin|Willard A. Mullins]] an ideology should be contrasted with the related (but different) issues of ''utopia'' and ''historical myth''. An ideology is composed of four basic characteristics:\n# it must have power over cognition\n# it must be capable of guiding one's evaluations;\n# it must provide guidance towards action; and\n# it must be logically coherent.\n\n[[Terry Eagleton]] outlines (more or less in no particular order) some definitions of ideology:<ref>Eagleton, Terry (1991) ''Ideology: An Introduction'', Verso, {{ISBN|0-86091-319-8}}</ref>\n# The process of production of meanings, signs and values in social life\n# A body of ideas characteristic of a particular social group or class\n# Ideas that help legitimate a dominant political power\n# False ideas that help legitimate a dominant political power\n# Systematically distorted communication\n# Ideas that offer a position for a subject\n# Forms of thought motivated by social interests\n# Identity thinking\n# Socially necessary illusion\n# The conjuncture of [[discourse]] and power\n# The medium in which conscious social actors make sense of their world\n# Action-oriented sets of beliefs\n# The confusion of linguistic and phenomenal reality\n# Semiotic closure<ref>{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Jk2h8zoHfcIC&pg=PA197&lpg=PA197&dq=semiotic+closure+terry+eagleton|title=Ideology: An Introduction|first=Terry|last=Eagleton|date=28 January 1991|publisher=Verso|via=Google Books|isbn=9780860915386}}</ref>\n# The indispensable medium in which individuals live out their relations to a social structure\n# The process that converts social life to a natural reality\n\nThe German philosopher [https://web.archive.org/web/20110701015904/http://www.ideologieforschung.de/web/Christian_Duncker.html Christian Duncker] called for a \"critical reflection of the ideology concept\" (2006). In his work, he strove to bring the concept of ideology into the foreground, as well as the closely connected concerns of [[epistemology]] and history. In this work, the term ideology is defined in terms of a system of presentations that explicitly or implicitly claim to absolute truth.\n\nThere are many different kinds of ideologies: [[politics|political]], [[Social issues|social]], [[epistemological]], and [[ethics|ethical]].\n\n===Marxist view===\n[[File:Karl Marx.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|[[Karl Marx]] posits that a society's dominant ideology is integral to its superstructure.]]\nIn the [[Marxist]] [[base and superstructure (Marxism)|economic base and superstructure]] model of society, ''base'' denotes the [[relations of production]] and [[modes of production]], and ''superstructure'' denotes the dominant ideology (religious, legal, political systems). The economic base of production determines the political superstructure of a society. Ruling class-interests determine the superstructure and the nature of the justifying ideology\u2014actions feasible because the ruling class control the means of production. For example, in a [[feudal]] [[mode of production]], religious ideology is the most prominent aspect of the superstructure, while in capitalist formations, ideologies such as [[liberalism]] and [[social democracy]] dominate. Hence the great importance of the ideology justifying a society; it politically confuses the alienated groups of society via [[false consciousness]].\n\nSome explanations have been presented. [[Gy\u00f6rgy Luk\u00e1cs]] proposes ideology as a [[psychological projection|projection]] of the [[class consciousness]] of the ruling class. [[Antonio Gramsci]] uses [[cultural hegemony]] to explain why the [[working-class]] have a false ideological conception of what their best interests are. Marx argued that \"The class which has the means of material production at its disposal has control at the same time over the means of mental production.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Marx|first=Karl|title=\"The Civil War in France\", The Marx-Engels Reader 2nd ed.|year=1978a|publisher=W.W. Norton & Company|location=New York}}</ref>\n\nThe Marxist formulation of \"ideology as an instrument of social reproduction\" is conceptually important to the [[sociology of knowledge]],<ref>In this discipline, there are lexical disputes over the meaning of the word \"ideology\" (\"false consciousness\" as advocated by Marx, or rather \"false position\" of a statement in itself is correct but irrelevant in the context in which it is produced, as in [[Max Weber]]'s opinion): {{cite journal|last1=Buonomo|first1=Giampiero|title = Eleggibilit\u00e0 pi\u00f9 ampia senza i paletti del peculato d'uso?

[[Karl Mannheim]], [[Daniel Bell]], and [[J\u00fcrgen Habermas]] et al. Moreover, Mannheim has developed, and progressed, from the \"total\" but \"special\" Marxist conception of ideology to a \"general\" and \"total\" ideological conception acknowledging that all ideology (including [[Marxism]]) resulted from social life, an idea developed by the [[sociology|sociologist]] [[Pierre Bourdieu]]. [[Slavoj \u017di\u017eek]] and the earlier [[Frankfurt School]] added to the \"general theory\" of ideology a psychoanalytic insight that ideologies do not include only conscious, but also [[unconscious mind|unconscious]] ideas.\n\n{{Original research section|date=February 2020}}\n\n===Louis Althusser's ideological state apparatuses===\nFrench Marxist philosopher [[Louis Althusser]] proposed that ideology is \"the imagined existence (or idea) of things as it relates to the real conditions of existence\" and makes use of a [[lacunar discourse]]. A number of propositions, which are never untrue, suggest a number of other propositions, which are. In this way, the essence of the lacunar discourse is what is ''not'' told (but is suggested).\n\nFor example, the statement \"All are equal before the law\", which is a theoretical groundwork of current legal systems, suggests that all people may be of equal worth or have equal opportunities. This is not true, for the concept of [[private property]] and power over the [[means of production]] results in some people being able to own more (''much'' more) than others. This power disparity contradicts the claim that all share both practical worth and future opportunity equally; for example, the rich can afford better legal representation, which practically privileges them before the law.\n\nAlthusser also proffered the concept of the [[ideological state apparatus]] to explain his theory of ideology. His first thesis was \"''ideology has no history''\": while individual ideolog''ies'' have histories, interleaved with the general class struggle of society, the general form of ideology is external to history.\n\nFor Althusser, beliefs and ideas are the products of social practices, not the reverse. His thesis that \"''ideas are material''\" is illustrated by the \"scandalous advice\" of [[Blaise Pascal|Pascal]] toward unbelievers: \"Kneel and pray, and then you will believe.\" What is ultimately ideological for Althusser are not the subjective beliefs held in the conscious \"minds\" of human individuals, but rather discourses that produce these beliefs, the material institutions and rituals that individuals take part in without submitting it to conscious examination and so much more [[critical thinking]].\n\n===Ideology and the Commodity in the works of Guy Debord===\nThe French [[Marxist]] theorist [[Guy Debord]], founding member of the [[Situationist International]], argued that when the commodity becomes the \"essential category\" of society, i.e. when the process of [[commodification]] has been consummated to its fullest extent, the image of society propagated by the commodity (as it describes all of life as constituted by notions and objects deriving their value only as commodities tradeable in terms of [[exchange value]]), colonizes all of life and reduces society to a mere representation, [[The Society of the Spectacle]].<ref>{{cite book|title=The Society of the Spectacle|publisher=Zone Books|author=Guy Debord|year=1995}}</ref>\n\n===Silvio Vietta: ideology and rationality===\n{{Disputed section|date=July 2015}}\nThe German [[cultural historian]] [[Silvio Vietta]] described the development and expansion of Western rationality from ancient times onwards as often accompanied by and shaped by ideologies like that of the \"just war\", the \"true religion\", racism, nationalism, or the vision of future history as a kind of heaven on earth in communism. He said that ideas like these became ideologies by giving hegemonic political actions an idealistic veneer and equipping their leaders with a higher and, in the \"[[political religion]]s\" ([[Eric Voegelin]]), nearly God-like power, so that they became masters over the lives (and the deaths) of millions of people. He considered that ideologies therefore contributed to power politics irrational shields of ideas beneath which they could operate as manifestations of idealism.<ref>{{cite book|title=A Theory of Global Civilization: Rationality and the Irrational as the Driving Forces of History|publisher=Kindle Ebooks|author=Silvio Vietta|year=2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Rationalit\u00e4t.

Often the leader must wait long in the wings until the time is ripe.  He calls for sacrifices in the present, to justify his vision of a breathtaking future.  The skills required include:  audacity, brazenness, iron will, fanatical conviction; passionate hatred, cunning, a delight in symbols; ability to inspire blind faith in the masses and a group of able lieutenants.<ref>[[Eric Hoffer]], ''[[The True Believer]]'', Harper Perennial, 1951, pp. 112-14.</ref>  Charlatanism is indispensable, and the leader often imitates both friend and foe, \"a single-minded fashioning after a model\".  He will not lead followers towards the \"promised land\", but only \"away from their unwanted selves\".<ref>[[Eric Hoffer]], ''[[The True Believer]]'', Harper Perennial, 1951, pp. 116-19.</ref>\n\n6) Action:  Original thoughts are suppressed, and unity encouraged, if the masses are kept occupied through great projects, marches, exploration and industry.<ref>[[Eric Hoffer]], ''[[The True Believer]]'', Harper Perennial, 1951, pp. 120-21.</ref>\n\n7) Suspicion:  \"There is prying and spying, tense watching and a tense awareness of being watched.\"  This pathological mistrust goes unchallenged and encourages conformity, not dissent.<ref>[[Eric Hoffer]], ''[[The True Believer]]'', Harper Perennial, 1951, p. 124.</ref>\n\n===Ronald Inglehart===\n\n[[Ronald Inglehart]] of the University of Michigan is author of the [[World Values Survey]], which, since 1980, has mapped social attitudes in 100 countries representing 90% of global population. Results indicate that where people live is likely to closely correlate with their ideological beliefs. In much of Africa, South Asia and the Middle East, people prefer traditional beliefs and are less tolerant of liberal values. Protestant Europe, at the other extreme, adheres more to secular beliefs and liberal values. Alone among high-income countries, the United States is exceptional in its adherence to traditional beliefs, in this case Christianity.\n\n==Political ideologies==<!--This section is linked from [[Charles de Gaulle]]-->\n{{See also|List of political ideologies}}\nIn [[social studies]], a political ideology is a certain ethical set of [[ideal (ethics)|ideals]], principles, [[doctrine]]s, [[mythology|myths]], or [[symbol]]s of a [[social movement]], [[institution]], [[social class|class]], or large group that explains how society should work, and offers some political and cultural blueprint for a certain social order. Political ideologies are concerned with many different aspects of a society, including (for example): the economy, [[education]], [[health care]], [[labor law]], [[criminal law]], the [[justice system]], the provision of [[social security]] and [[social welfare]], [[trade]], the [[environmentalism|environment]], [[minor (law)|minors]], [[immigration]], [[race (classification of human beings)|race]], use of the [[military]], [[patriotism]], and [[established religion]].\n\nPolitical ideologies have two dimensions:\n# Goals: how society should work\n# Methods: the most appropriate ways to achieve the ideal arrangement\n\nThere are many proposed methods for the classification of political ideologies, each of these different methods generate a specific [[political spectrum]].{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} Ideologies also identify themselves by their position on the [[political spectrum]] (such as the [[left-wing politics|left]], the [[center (politics)|center]] or the [[right-wing politics|right]]), though precision in this respect can very often become controversial. Finally, ideologies can be distinguished from [[political strategy|political strategies]] (e.g., [[populism]]) and from single issues that a party may be built around (e.g. [[Marijuana political parties|legalization of marijuana]]). Philosopher Michael Oakeshott provides a good definition of ideology as \"the formalized abridgment of the supposed sub-stratum of the rational truth contained in the tradition\".\n\nA political ideology largely concerns itself with how to allocate [[power (sociology)|power]] and to what ends power should be used. Some parties follow a certain ideology very closely, while others may take broad inspiration from a group of related ideologies without specifically embracing any one of them. Each political ideology contains certain ideas on what it considers the best [[form of government]] (e.g., [[democracy]], [[demagogy]], [[theocracy]], [[caliphate]] etc.), and the best [[economic system]] (e.g. [[capitalism]], [[socialism]], etc.). Sometimes the same word is used to identify both an ideology and one of its main ideas. For instance, \"socialism\" may refer to an economic system, or it may refer to an ideology that supports that economic system.\n\nStudies of the concept of ideology itself (rather than specific ideologies) have been carried out under the name of [[systematic ideology]].\n\nPost 1991, many commentators claim that we are living in a post-ideological age,<ref>[[Daniel Bell|Bell, D.]] ''[[The End of Ideology|The End of Ideology: On the Exhaustion of Political Ideas in the Fifties]] (2000) (2nd ed.).

[[Perceptual psychology|Perceptual psychologist]] [[James J. Gibson]] believed that human perception of ecological relationships was the basis of [[self-awareness]] and [[cognition]] itself. [[Linguistics|Linguist]] [[George Lakoff]] has proposed a [[cognitive science of mathematics]] wherein even the most fundamental ideas of arithmetic would be seen as consequences or products of human perception\u2014which is itself necessarily evolved within an ecology.\n\n[[Deep ecology]] and the modern [[ecology movement]] (and, to a lesser degree, [[Green parties]]) appear to have adopted ecological sciences as a positive ideology.\n\nSome accuse [[ecological economics]] of likewise turning scientific theory into [[political economy]], although theses in that science can often be tested. The modern practice of [[green economics]] fuses both approaches and seems to be part science, part ideology.\n\nThis is far from the only theory of economics raised to ideology status. Some notable economically based ideologies include [[neoliberalism]], [[monetarism]], [[mercantilism]], [[mixed economy]], [[social Darwinism]], [[communism]], [[laissez-faire|laissez-faire economics]], and [[free trade]] {{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}.

The word was created by assembling the words [[idea#John Locke|''idea'']], from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|[[wikt:\u1f30\u03b4\u03ad\u03b1|\u1f30\u03b4\u03ad\u03b1]]}} (near to the [[John Locke|Lockean]] sense) and ''[[-logy]]'', from {{lang|grc|[[wikt:-\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03af\u03b1|-\u03bb\u03bf\u03b3\u03af\u03b1]]}}.\nHe devised the term for a \"science of ideas\" he hoped would form a secure foundation for the moral and political sciences. He based the word on two things:  1) sensations people experience as they interact with the material world; and 2) the ideas that form in their minds due to those sensations. He conceived \"Ideology\" as a [[liberalism|liberal]] philosophy that would defend individual liberty, property,  [[free markets]], and constitutional limits on state power.  He argues that among these aspects, ideology is the most generic term because the science of ideas also contains the study of their expression and deduction.<ref name = kennedy/>\n\nThe coup that overthrew [[Maximilien Robespierre]] allowed Tracy to pursue his work.<ref name = kennedy>{{cite journal |last=Kennedy |first=Emmet |date=Jul\u2013Sep 1979 |title=\"Ideology\" from Destutt De Tracy to Marx |journal=Journal of the History of Ideas |volume=40 |issue=3 |pages=353\u2013368 |jstor=2709242 |doi=10.2307/2709242|bibcode=1961JHI....22..215C }}</ref><ref name = hart/>\n\nTracy reacted to the terroristic phase of the revolution (during the Napoleonic regime) by trying to work out a rational system of ideas to oppose the irrational mob impulses that had nearly destroyed him.\n\n[[Napoleon Bonaparte]] came to view 'Ideology' a term of abuse, which he often hurled against his liberal foes in Tracy's [[Institutional]]. According to [[Karl Mannheim]]'s historical reconstruction of the shifts in the meaning of ideology, the modern meaning of the word was born when Napoleon used it to describe his opponents as \"the ideologues\". [[Karl Marx]] adopted this negative sense of the term and used it in his writings (he described Tracy as a \"fischbl\u00fctige Bourgeoisdoktrin\u00e4r\", a fishblooded bourgeois doctrine).<ref>De Tracy, Destutt (1801) ''Les \u00c9l\u00e9ments d'id\u00e9ologie'', 3rd ed.

He describes ideology as rather like teaching philosophy by the [[Socratic method]], but without extending the vocabulary beyond what the general reader already possessed, and without the examples from observation that practical science would require. Taine identifies it not just with Destutt De Tracy, but also with his milieu, and includes [[\u00c9tienne Bonnot de Condillac|Condillac]] as one of its precursors. (Destutt de Tracy read the works of Locke and Condillac while he was imprisoned during the [[Reign of Terror]].))\n\nThe term \"ideology\" has [[Euphemism Treadmill|dropped some of its pejorative sting]], and has become a neutral term in the analysis of differing political opinions and views of social groups.<ref>Eagleton, Terry (1991) ''Ideology.

Through this system, ideas become coherent repeated patterns through the subjective ongoing choices that people make. These ideas serve as the seed around which further thought grows.  Believers in ideology range from passive acceptance through fervent advocacy to true belief. According to most recent analysis, ideologies are neither necessarily right nor wrong.\n\nDefinitions, such as by [[Manfred Steger]] and [[Paul James (academic)|Paul James]] emphasize both the issue of patterning and contingent claims to truth:\n\n{{quote|Ideologies are patterned clusters of normatively imbued ideas and concepts, including particular representations of power relations.

In his work, he strove to bring the concept of ideology into the foreground, as well as the closely connected concerns of [[epistemology]] and history. In this work, the term ideology is defined in terms of a system of presentations that explicitly or implicitly claim to absolute truth.\n\nThere are many different kinds of ideologies: [[politics|political]], [[Social issues|social]], [[epistemological]], and [[ethics|ethical]].\n\n===Marxist view===\n[[File:Karl Marx.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|[[Karl Marx]] posits that a society's dominant ideology is integral to its superstructure.]]\nIn the [[Marxist]] [[base and superstructure (Marxism)|economic base and superstructure]] model of society, ''base'' denotes the [[relations of production]] and [[modes of production]], and ''superstructure'' denotes the dominant ideology (religious, legal, political systems). The economic base of production determines the political superstructure of a society. Ruling class-interests determine the superstructure and the nature of the justifying ideology\u2014actions feasible because the ruling class control the means of production. For example, in a [[feudal]] [[mode of production]], religious ideology is the most prominent aspect of the superstructure, while in capitalist formations, ideologies such as [[liberalism]] and [[social democracy]] dominate. Hence the great importance of the ideology justifying a society; it politically confuses the alienated groups of society via [[false consciousness]].\n\nSome explanations have been presented. [[Gy\u00f6rgy Luk\u00e1cs]] proposes ideology as a [[psychological projection|projection]] of the [[class consciousness]] of the ruling class. [[Antonio Gramsci]] uses [[cultural hegemony]] to explain why the [[working-class]] have a false ideological conception of what their best interests are. Marx argued that \"The class which has the means of material production at its disposal has control at the same time over the means of mental production.\"<ref>{{cite book|last=Marx|first=Karl|title=\"The Civil War in France\", The Marx-Engels Reader 2nd ed.|year=1978a|publisher=W.W.

[[Karl Mannheim]], [[Daniel Bell]], and [[J\u00fcrgen Habermas]] et al. Moreover, Mannheim has developed, and progressed, from the \"total\" but \"special\" Marxist conception of ideology to a \"general\" and \"total\" ideological conception acknowledging that all ideology (including [[Marxism]]) resulted from social life, an idea developed by the [[sociology|sociologist]] [[Pierre Bourdieu]]. [[Slavoj \u017di\u017eek]] and the earlier [[Frankfurt School]] added to the \"general theory\" of ideology a psychoanalytic insight that ideologies do not include only conscious, but also [[unconscious mind|unconscious]] ideas.\n\n{{Original research section|date=February 2020}}\n\n===Louis Althusser's ideological state apparatuses===\nFrench Marxist philosopher [[Louis Althusser]] proposed that ideology is \"the imagined existence (or idea) of things as it relates to the real conditions of existence\" and makes use of a [[lacunar discourse]]. A number of propositions, which are never untrue, suggest a number of other propositions, which are. In this way, the essence of the lacunar discourse is what is ''not'' told (but is suggested).\n\nFor example, the statement \"All are equal before the law\", which is a theoretical groundwork of current legal systems, suggests that all people may be of equal worth or have equal opportunities. This is not true, for the concept of [[private property]] and power over the [[means of production]] results in some people being able to own more (''much'' more) than others. This power disparity contradicts the claim that all share both practical worth and future opportunity equally; for example, the rich can afford better legal representation, which practically privileges them before the law.\n\nAlthusser also proffered the concept of the [[ideological state apparatus]] to explain his theory of ideology. His first thesis was \"''ideology has no history''\": while individual ideolog''ies'' have histories, interleaved with the general class struggle of society, the general form of ideology is external to history.\n\nFor Althusser, beliefs and ideas are the products of social practices, not the reverse. His thesis that \"''ideas are material''\" is illustrated by the \"scandalous advice\" of [[Blaise Pascal|Pascal]] toward unbelievers: \"Kneel and pray, and then you will believe.\" What is ultimately ideological for Althusser are not the subjective beliefs held in the conscious \"minds\" of human individuals, but rather discourses that produce these beliefs, the material institutions and rituals that individuals take part in without submitting it to conscious examination and so much more [[critical thinking]].\n\n===Ideology and the Commodity in the works of Guy Debord===\nThe French [[Marxist]] theorist [[Guy Debord]], founding member of the [[Situationist International]], argued that when the commodity becomes the \"essential category\" of society, i.e. when the process of [[commodification]] has been consummated to its fullest extent, the image of society propagated by the commodity (as it describes all of life as constituted by notions and objects deriving their value only as commodities tradeable in terms of [[exchange value]]), colonizes all of life and reduces society to a mere representation, [[The Society of the Spectacle]].<ref>{{cite book|title=The Society of the Spectacle|publisher=Zone Books|author=Guy Debord|year=1995}}</ref>\n\n===Silvio Vietta: ideology and rationality===\n{{Disputed section|date=July 2015}}\nThe German [[cultural historian]] [[Silvio Vietta]] described the development and expansion of Western rationality from ancient times onwards as often accompanied by and shaped by ideologies like that of the \"just war\", the \"true religion\", racism, nationalism, or the vision of future history as a kind of heaven on earth in communism. He said that ideas like these became ideologies by giving hegemonic political actions an idealistic veneer and equipping their leaders with a higher and, in the \"[[political religion]]s\" ([[Eric Voegelin]]), nearly God-like power, so that they became masters over the lives (and the deaths) of millions of people. He considered that ideologies therefore contributed to power politics irrational shields of ideas beneath which they could operate as manifestations of idealism.<ref>{{cite book|title=A Theory of Global Civilization: Rationality and the Irrational as the Driving Forces of History|publisher=Kindle Ebooks|author=Silvio Vietta|year=2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Rationalit\u00e4t.

Often the leader must wait long in the wings until the time is ripe.  He calls for sacrifices in the present, to justify his vision of a breathtaking future.  The skills required include:  audacity, brazenness, iron will, fanatical conviction; passionate hatred, cunning, a delight in symbols; ability to inspire blind faith in the masses and a group of able lieutenants.<ref>[[Eric Hoffer]], ''[[The True Believer]]'', Harper Perennial, 1951, pp. 112-14.</ref>  Charlatanism is indispensable, and the leader often imitates both friend and foe, \"a single-minded fashioning after a model\".

Results indicate that where people live is likely to closely correlate with their ideological beliefs. In much of Africa, South Asia and the Middle East, people prefer traditional beliefs and are less tolerant of liberal values. Protestant Europe, at the other extreme, adheres more to secular beliefs and liberal values. Alone among high-income countries, the United States is exceptional in its adherence to traditional beliefs, in this case Christianity.\n\n==Political ideologies==<!--This section is linked from [[Charles de Gaulle]]-->\n{{See also|List of political ideologies}}\nIn [[social studies]], a political ideology is a certain ethical set of [[ideal (ethics)|ideals]], principles, [[doctrine]]s, [[mythology|myths]], or [[symbol]]s of a [[social movement]], [[institution]], [[social class|class]], or large group that explains how society should work, and offers some political and cultural blueprint for a certain social order. Political ideologies are concerned with many different aspects of a society, including (for example): the economy, [[education]], [[health care]], [[labor law]], [[criminal law]], the [[justice system]], the provision of [[social security]] and [[social welfare]], [[trade]], the [[environmentalism|environment]], [[minor (law)|minors]], [[immigration]], [[race (classification of human beings)|race]], use of the [[military]], [[patriotism]], and [[established religion]].\n\nPolitical ideologies have two dimensions:\n# Goals: how society should work\n# Methods: the most appropriate ways to achieve the ideal arrangement\n\nThere are many proposed methods for the classification of political ideologies, each of these different methods generate a specific [[political spectrum]].{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} Ideologies also identify themselves by their position on the [[political spectrum]] (such as the [[left-wing politics|left]], the [[center (politics)|center]] or the [[right-wing politics|right]]), though precision in this respect can very often become controversial. Finally, ideologies can be distinguished from [[political strategy|political strategies]] (e.g., [[populism]]) and from single issues that a party may be built around (e.g. [[Marijuana political parties|legalization of marijuana]]). Philosopher Michael Oakeshott provides a good definition of ideology as \"the formalized abridgment of the supposed sub-stratum of the rational truth contained in the tradition\".\n\nA political ideology largely concerns itself with how to allocate [[power (sociology)|power]] and to what ends power should be used. Some parties follow a certain ideology very closely, while others may take broad inspiration from a group of related ideologies without specifically embracing any one of them. Each political ideology contains certain ideas on what it considers the best [[form of government]] (e.g., [[democracy]], [[demagogy]], [[theocracy]], [[caliphate]] etc.), and the best [[economic system]] (e.g. [[capitalism]], [[socialism]], etc.). Sometimes the same word is used to identify both an ideology and one of its main ideas. For instance, \"socialism\" may refer to an economic system, or it may refer to an ideology that supports that economic system.\n\nStudies of the concept of ideology itself (rather than specific ideologies) have been carried out under the name of [[systematic ideology]].\n\nPost 1991, many commentators claim that we are living in a post-ideological age,<ref>[[Daniel Bell|Bell, D.]] ''[[The End of Ideology|The End of Ideology: On the Exhaustion of Political Ideas in the Fifties]] (2000) (2nd ed.). Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, pg. 393''</ref> in which redemptive, all-encompassing ideologies have failed, and this view is often associated{{by whom|date=August 2015}} with [[Francis Fukuyama]]'s writings on \"the end of history\".<ref>Fukuyama, F.

William Fulbright]].<ref>Fulbright, The Arrogance of Power, 1967, chapters 3-7</ref>\nThe revolution thus becomes established as an [[Ideocracy]], but its rise is likely to be checked by a [[Political midlife crisis]].\n\n==Epistemological ideologies==\nEven when the challenging of existing beliefs is encouraged, as in scientific theories, the dominant [[paradigm]] or [[mindset]] can prevent certain challenges, theories, or experiments from being advanced.\n\nA special case of science adopted as ideology is that of ecology, which studies the relationships among living things on Earth. [[Perceptual psychology|Perceptual psychologist]] [[James J. Gibson]] believed that human perception of ecological relationships was the basis of [[self-awareness]] and [[cognition]] itself. [[Linguistics|Linguist]] [[George Lakoff]] has proposed a [[cognitive science of mathematics]] wherein even the most fundamental ideas of arithmetic would be seen as consequences or products of human perception\u2014which is itself necessarily evolved within an ecology.\n\n[[Deep ecology]] and the modern [[ecology movement]] (and, to a lesser degree, [[Green parties]]) appear to have adopted ecological sciences as a positive ideology.\n\nSome accuse [[ecological economics]] of likewise turning scientific theory into [[political economy]], although theses in that science can often be tested. The modern practice of [[green economics]] fuses both approaches and seems to be part science, part ideology.\n\nThis is far from the only theory of economics raised to ideology status. Some notable economically based ideologies include [[neoliberalism]], [[monetarism]], [[mercantilism]], [[mixed economy]], [[social Darwinism]], [[communism]], [[laissez-faire|laissez-faire economics]], and [[free trade]] {{Citation needed|date=April 2020}}.

She won the 2013 [[Olivier Award]] for [[Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role|Best Supporting Actress]] for the play ''[[The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time (play)|The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time]]'', and has twice been nominated for the [[British Academy Television Award for Best Supporting Actress|BAFTA TV Award for Best Supporting Actress]] for the [[BBC]] drama ''[[Last Tango in Halifax]]''.\n\n==Early life==\nWalker was born in [[Stepney]] in the [[East End of London]] and has an older brother. She attended [[Saint Nicholas School, Essex|Saint Nicholas School]], [[Old Harlow]], and [[Forest School, Walthamstow]], and undertook acting classes from age 12 in order to speak to boys.<ref name=Wylie/> Interviewed in 2014 by ''[[The Guardian]]'', she said, \"I was really encouraged by my mother. My dad thought it was a ridiculous thing to do.\"<ref name=guardian>{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/theatre/10735392/Nicola-Walker-Ive-got-a-feisty-face.html|title=Nicola Walker: 'I've got a feisty face'|date=4 April 2014|work=Telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=1 February 2015}}</ref>\n\nWalker then attended [[New Hall, Cambridge]], where she started her acting career with the [[Cambridge Footlights]].

They're meant to hold your hand. She asked to borrow my bike, got drunk, and I never saw it again.\" Walker acted on stage as Perkins's stooge and years later their partnership was resumed when Perkins cast Walker in her sitcom ''[[Heading Out]]''.<ref name=guardian/>\n\n==Career==\nOffered a place at the [[Royal Academy of Dramatic Art]] on graduation from Cambridge, Walker already had some roles and an agent, so she decided to pursue her acting career.

She returned in 2009 and continued until the series ended in 2011. Benji Wilson of ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' praised Walker's performance, stating: \"an actress who has squeezed every drop out of TV\u2019s greatest ever largely dumbstruck doormat for the best part of a decade.

She attended [[Saint Nicholas School, Essex|Saint Nicholas School]], [[Old Harlow]], and [[Forest School, Walthamstow]], and undertook acting classes from age 12 in order to speak to boys.<ref name=Wylie/> Interviewed in 2014 by ''[[The Guardian]]'', she said, \"I was really encouraged by my mother.

They're meant to hold your hand. She asked to borrow my bike, got drunk, and I never saw it again.\" Walker acted on stage as Perkins's stooge and years later their partnership was resumed when Perkins cast Walker in her sitcom ''[[Heading Out]]''.<ref name=guardian/>\n\n==Career==\nOffered a place at the [[Royal Academy of Dramatic Art]] on graduation from Cambridge, Walker already had some roles and an agent, so she decided to pursue her acting career.

She returned in 2009 and continued until the series ended in 2011. Benji Wilson of ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' praised Walker's performance, stating: \"an actress who has squeezed every drop out of TV\u2019s greatest ever largely dumbstruck doormat for the best part of a decade.

After his return to Egypt, he began to form cavalry teams based on the European system, and a number of European teachers prepared for this purpose.\n\nThe Military Academy of Cavalry was established in [[Giza]] at Mourad Bey Palace, which was turned into a cavalry barracks. The school was organized by Monsieu Varane, who was from the officers of the Napoleonic Empire, Yawar, Marshal Gouvion Sancer, and her young pupils learning about cavalry maneuvers and infantry movements.

While the school was lacking to reach a degree of perfection, some lessons in language, drawing, and so forth, but there is no dispute that it is from the side of organizing the cavalry teams, it lacks nothing, The students are good at riding horses, the maneuvers they perform take place with lightness, accuracy and wisdom, their system and their best regret, and their morale is fine, they are soldiers with all the meanings of the word, and the trumpet bearers perform their work with perfection. \"\n\n== Post Anglo-Egyptian War ==\nAfter the [[British Conquest of Egypt (1882)|Anglo-Egyptian war]], the Egyptian Military HC was totally governed by [[British Empire|British]] generals to and was made smaller until it totally became a homeland defence.\nThe Cavalry Corps was split into [[Battalion|Battalions]] instead of [[Regiment|Regiments]]. Their main engagement after the war was the long-running [[Mahdist War]]\n\n== World War I ==\nIn [[World War I]] it was estimated that around one million Egyptians fought on the Entente on many different fronts including 100,000 of them on European Fronts (Greece, Italy, France and Belgium). Most of the Cavalry participations were on the [[North Africa|North African]] and Arabian fronts.\n\n== Interwar and Modernization ==\nAfter World War I by a few years, Egypt ended the British Protectorate over it and a Kingdom under the rule of [[Fuad I of Egypt|Fuad I]] was established. Fuad's program was to modernize everything in the country's economy, military, education, etc. The military modernization was focused on mechanization, building new military schools and mobilizing more men & reestablishing units. The mechanization process went totally on the Cavalry Corps where many of its units (except the Royal Guards) replaced its traditional horse formations with Armored Vehicles and Tanks that by the late 1930s all of the Corps was mechanized, also in the year 1928 its name was changed to ''Royal Egyptian Cavalry Corps''\n== World War II ==\nInformation about the Egyptian Armored units that fought are not totally known, it's only known that Egypt had around 7 Cavalry Regiments and that the 12th & 16th Regiments fought on the western desert campaign. A huge change also happened in the Corps, where the Cavalry before the war was using Armored Cars and [[Light tank|Light Tanks]] while prior to the war and after it the Cavalry Corps started to use Medium and [[Heavy tank|Heavy Tanks]] (i.e. Crusader MKII, Matilda, Centurion, etc). \n\n== First Arab-Israel War ==\nDuring the [[1948 Arab\u2013Israeli War|First Arab-Israeli war,]] Egyptian Cavalry units sent with the 20,000 troops Expeditionary forces, were in a form of Squadrons of M4 Shermans and Vickers MKII. and were very successful in battles.\n\n== Suez Crisis ==\nArmored Corps involvement in the 1956 war began on October 29, 1956, when a [[reconnaissance]] regiment, followed by the 1st and 2nd Armoured Groups (brigades) was ordered to cross the Canal, from its location in the Deversoir area to the eastern side to counter detected Israeli advances. The plan was to pull the division into [[Sinai Peninsula|Sinai]] and attack [[Cairo]] from the Northeast but this plan was quickly discovered and the division was sent to the Port Said front instead. \n\n== North Yemen Civil War ==\nAs the political and military situation got worsened after the [[Coup d'\u00e9tat|coup d'etat]] in 1961,{{Which|date=April 2020}} Egypt decided to intervene at first with a small military force, and then later with a large scale invasion force. The Egyptian Armored Corps fought there extensively, with the 4th Armored division and Armored brigades supporting Infantry divisions. Their most notable service there was during the Ramadan Offensive. \n\n== Six-Day War ==\nThe Egyptian Armored Corps were obliterated in Sinai during the [[Six-Day War]]. Reasons for this included their use of old tanks, their lack of air cover, and their late reaction.{{Clarify|reason=|date=April 2020}} The Israelis, on the other hand, used modern [[Centurion (tank)|Centurion]], [[Magach]], and [[M60 tank|M60]] tanks, and they had a strong air force that was very effective against Egyptian tanks.\n\n== Post Six Day War modernization ==\nAfter the Six Day War, the whole Armed forces went through a process of extensive training and modernization to prepare for the [[Yom Kippur War]]. The Armored Corps replaced the old T-54s and T-34s with T-62s, got trained on newer tactics, new better commanders got in command and new units were formed. \n== Yom Kippur War ==\nAs the Egyptian Military was modernized after Six Day War, the Armored Corps got new formations, equipment and strategies of attacking such as adding a reserve armored brigade to armored divisions and replacing the old T-34s and SU-100s with T-62s and BMP-1s. \n\n*Operation Badr\n\nAs the Air Force was hunting its targets in Sinai, Artillery bombing Bar Lev fortifications turning it into an Abyss part of hell and Infantry storming the east bank of [[Suez Canal]] ready to slaughter any IDF personnel, on the other hand the Israeli reserve Armored units were storming the Egyptian forces, but catastrophically defeated by Anti-Tank squadrons using the AT-3 sagger wire-guided missiles. Israeli Armored units lost around 320 tanks out of 400 to these Anti-Tank Squadrons.\n\nWhen the Egyptian Infantry started controlling hardpoints and fortresses along the Bar Lev line through a series of battles. On October 7th, Egyptian Armored units of the 2nd & 3rd Armies and Port Said Sector passed over the bridgeheads (Pontoon bridges) made by the Egyptian Combat Engineers and entered combat with the Infantry formations in several battles such as Battle of Firdan alongside the 2nd Infantry division and the heavy Armored battles of El Qantarah alongside the 18th Infantry division.\n\nThe Armored corps has done a lot of heroic actions throughout the war but their most notable action throughout the war was the advance of the 12th Brigade of the 4th Armored division 22 KM deep into Sinai without having Air or Artillery cover or even Anti-Tank support against a fully prepared Israeli force, although the Brigade wasn't supported very well so it managed to trick the Israelis and surprisingly attack them which led to heavy casualties on the Israeli side, however, the Israelis could defeat them at the end due to having Air, Artillery and Anti-Tank support.\n\n== Gulf War ==\nAs Iraq invaded Kuwait, Egypt alongside a group of Arab countries were extremely opposing Iraq after that. When the coalition was formed, Egypt established a 35,000 strong corps-sized force made up of the 4th Armored division, 3rd Mechanized division, 170th Airborne brigade, Special forces regiment and a number of support units such as Engineers and Air defence. \n\n\n\n[[Category:Military of Egypt]]\n", "text_old": "{{Multiple issues|{{Underlinked|date=February 2020}}\n{{unref|date=February 2020}}\n{{Copy edit|date=April 2020}}\n{{Confusing|date=April 2020}}\n{{Overly detailed|details=details of individual conflicts seem unimportant to the history of the article's subject|date=April 2020}}}}\n\n{{Infobox military unit\n|unit_name=Egyptian Armored Corps\n|native_name=\u0633\u0644\u0627\u062d \u0627\u0644\u0645\u062f\u0631\u0639\u0627\u062a \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0635\u0631\u064a\n|dates=1828-present.\n|country={{flag|Egypt}}\n|command_structure=[[Armored Corps Command]]\n|branch=[[Egyptian Army]]\n|type=Armored\n|specialization=Armored Operations\n|size=4 divisions, 14 brigades and 4 battalions\n|colors=Red & Green\n|mascot=Treaded Chariot\n|motto=Victory or Martyrdom\n|garrison=Heliopolis, Cairo\n|current_commander=Major General Reda Fadil}}\n\nThe '''Egyptian Armored Corps''' is a branch of the [[Egyptian Army|Egyptian army]] and the second main Corps responsible for [[Armoured warfare|Armored operations]].\n\n==Establishment==\n[[[Egypt army|Muhammad Ali of Egypt managed to build a strong standing army with modern weaponry, tactics, and training.]] As Ali's army came back from the [[Greek War of Independence]], his son, the commander of the army, [[Ibrahim Pasha of Egypt|Ibrahim Pasha]], suggested the creation of an Egyptian Cavalry Corps.

It was first introduced in the 1980s by '''P & M Software''', founded by Paul Meiners. GT Power can be used both to host a BBS as well as to connect to other BBS systems via its full-featured dial-up \"terminal mode.\"  GT Power was a [[shareware]] package that required a registration fee in order to access its [[Proprietary software|proprietary]] [[computer network|network]] mail transport/handling software and, by default, the ''GT Power Network''.  The software is distributed in two \"flavors\"; a terminal-only version, nicknamed ''GTO'', and the full-featured host and terminal version.  \n\nThe [[source code]] for GT Power was sold twice during the late 1990s, again in 2008 and is currently the property of Tom Watt.{{fact|date=July 2017}}\n\nAlthough GT Power was written to run under DOS, it is also quite capable under the [[Microsoft Windows]] (versions with DOS support) and [[OS/2]] / [[eComStation]] [[operating systems]].  When it is running under OS/2 or eComStation, GT Power can also be used as a [[telnet]] BBS host and terminal program via use of an OS/2 shareware virtual [[modem]] application called [[VMODEM]].\n\n==History==\nGT Power was originally a telecommunications/terminal application, known as ''GT Powercomm'', which could be used to dial-up other BBS systems.  As time passed, a [[bulletin board system|host mode]] was written into the application which allowed the user to accept incoming data calls.  Before the release of version 13.00 (released Autumn, 1987), the host mode portion of the application had been expanded to become a full-blown BBS host application, complete with message and file areas, file [[uploading]] and [[downloading]], the capability to host [[BBS door]] programs, and a [[sysop]]-to-user chat mode.<ref>READ.ME file contained in GT 13.00 documentation.  As per the documentation, version 12.00 was the first version with an \"expanded\" host mode.</ref>\n\nThe name was shortened to ''GT Power'' sometime before the release of version 14.03 in the Autumn of 1988.\n\nWith version 13.00, P & M software began offering a proprietary ''Netmail Suite''; a set of  applications which allow GT Power BBS systems to connect and exchange routed person-to-person '''netmail'''.<ref>READ.ME file contained in GT 13.00 documentation</ref>  By the time version 14.03 was released, the suite was expanded to include the ability to also exchange '''echomail''' between systems,<ref>GT Power documentation</ref> similar to [[FidoNet]] echomail.  Upon registering GT Power, the user obtained a special [[password]] which enabled the Netmail Suite applications, and a [[key code]] that disabled any registration reminder delays in GT Power.\n\nThe Netmail Suite consisted of a mail transfer program and two mail handling programs.  The mail transfer program, called ''MDRIVer'', was used to dial other GT Power systems, to authenticate their identity, and to transfer mail between the two systems.  The mail handling programs were used to \"bag\" mail and prepare it for transfer (''MBAGger''), and to unpack received mail and distribute it to the proper message areas (''MDIST'').\n\nP & M  Software released its last version of GT Power, version 19.00, in September, 1994.  In mid-February, 1998, it was announced that P&M Software had sold the GT Power source code to '''New Millennium Software'''.  New Millennium renamed the project '''GT 2000''' but, by the end of April,  it was announced that New Millennium would not develop the product. The source was sold again to Dennis Berry, a GT Power sysop.\n\nIn late 1999, Berry released a [[Y2K]] [[bug fix]] for the Netmail Suite. A third party Y2K fix for the Suite, as well as other [[third party software component|third party companion software]], was also released. The GT Power application itself appeared to have no Y2K issues, with 19.00 being the latest release.\n\nThe source code and rights were sold to Tom Watt in June 2008 and he has resumed development of GT-Power. For the first time since Paul stopped development, the source code has been made to compile the EXEs as they were last released in 1994.\n\n==Features==\nThe following list of features applies to the most-recent version of GT Power (19.00).<ref>GT Power 19.00 documentation</ref>\n\nFeatures of both the terminal and host modes:\n\n* [[ANSI]] and [[VT-52]] [[terminal emulation]];\n* [[ANSI art|ANSI]] color graphics and music support that does not require [[ANSI.SYS]] (introduced version 12.20);\n* [[Remote Imaging Protocol|RIP]] graphics support (ver. 19.00);\n* support for multiple dialing directories, with up to 999 entries each (terminal mode);\n* circular dialing queue, and redial-on-busy (terminal mode);\n* a script language, for creating dialing and other scripts;\n* user-assignable function key/macro support;\n* built-in [[file transfer protocol|file-transfer protocols]], including [[Xmodem]], [[WXmodem]], [[Ymodem]], [[SEAlink]], [[Telink]], & MegaLink;\n* support for up to 18 additional \"external\" file-transfer protocols, such as [[Zmodem]] and [[HS/Link]];\n* support for non-standard [[COM port]]s (3-8), & non-standard IRQs (up to [[Interrupt request|IRQ]] 15);\n* support for 300-33.6k [[baud]] [[modems]], [[16550 UART]], and locked port speeds up to 115200;\n* [[DESQview]], DoubleDos, Windows, and OS/2 aware;\n* [[caller-id]] support;\n* optional capture mode and scroll-back buffering;\n* the ability to use PC-Pursuit<ref>PC Pursuit was a semi-nationwide network pay service which allowed BBS users to dial local numbers to access BBS systems that would otherwise be a long-distance telephone call.  The system being called had to be located in a city that was \"PC-Pursuitable.\"  PC-Pursuit would complete the call and connect the systems.</ref>  to make outgoing calls, both in terminal mode and with ''MDRIVer''.\n\nIn addition, the BBS host mode has the following features:\n\n* Built-in [[QWK (file format)|QWK]] mail and QWK networking support (non-proprietary);\n* semi-configurable menus and prompts;\n* support for multiple message areas (ver. 12.10) and file areas (prior to ver. 12.00);\n* proprietary Netmail Suite with netmail and echomail support (ver. 13.00);\n* full-screen ANSI message editing;\n* [[CD-ROM]] file area support;\n* FILE.DIZ support for file uploads;\n* multinode capable, on a network or under [[computer multitasking|multitasking]] software, such as DESQview or OS/2;\n* multinode ''CB'' chat (users can chat between nodes);\n* time banking;\n* threaded reading of messages;\n* Carbon-Copy list support in messages;\n* Return Receipt message support in netmail;\n* support for up to 999 external BBS door programs (ver. 19.00; doors introduced ver. 12.20);\n* mailboxes for private user-to-user mail exchange (ver. 19.00);\n* variable substitution and ''@ macros'' for bulletin and menu files;\n* user-configurable multiple language support;\n* user-configurable questionnaire/voting booth functions (ver. 12.20);\n* user-configurable automatic [[virus scan]] of uploaded files;\n* the ability to set up \"freebie\" file downloads and file areas;\n* user-configurable access levels and controls (introduced before ver. 12.00);\n* a task scheduler, for scheduling daily maintenance, etc. (ver. 13.00);\n* two distinct varieties of ''RINGBACK'' service, one of which allows sysops to run a BBS on a voice line (ver. 13.00);\n* a user maintenance program, called ''SYSOP'' (ver. 15.00);\n* the ability to accept a \"hand-off\" from front-end programs, such as [[Binkleyterm]].\n\nOther features can be added via the use of third-party software and add-ons.\n\n===Telnet use===\n\nGT Power also has the [[undocumented feature]] of [[telnet]] compatibility, in both BBS host and terminal mode, when used with a virtual modem software package called VMODEM under the OS/2 and eComStation operating systems.\n\n==Third party software==\nMany third party software packages were developed to support the GT Power BBS.  Early distributions of GT Power included a third party application called ''GTCTL'', written by James Davis, followed later by ''Sysop Tools'',  written by Chris Smith.  Both were later replaced by the P & M ''SYSOP'' program.  Unlike SYSOP, Sysop Tools had an ANSI-style DOS graphic user interface.  All three were used mostly for user and control file maintenance.  Other third-party software includes:\n\n* external message readers, allowing the sysop to read & enter messages locally without logging into the BBS;\n* a QWK mail application, which could be added as a door or external menu option, that pre-dates and is more configurable than the built-in version (it could also be used for QWK networking);\n* Command line/batch file applications which allow GT Power systems to participate in Fidonet, RIME, and QWK networking;\n* applications which create popular door drop file formats, such as DOORINF and DOOR.SYS, allowing GT Power systems access to more BBS door software;\n* an application that allowed full-screen message editing, before it was included in GT Power;\n* an interface which allowed earlier GT Power systems to run the PCBoard door ''Prodoor'';\n* applications which allow GT Power systems to add Usenet newsgroups and Internet e-mail capability;\n* an application which allowed GT Power systems to exchange mail via Internet e-mail file attachments;\n* applications which allowed GT Power users to change their passwords online (since added to GT Power), as well as to force users to change passwords after a specified time;\n* various usage reporting applications;\n* various other applications.\n\nA third-party mail transfer program, called ''Mailrun'', was developed which allows GT Power Network systems to transfer mail using the bi-directional HS/Link protocol.  In theory, the use of the bi-directional protocol ( but does require a free key code from the developer in order to connect with other systems.  Mailrun is stated to be compatible with GT Power versions 17.00 through 19.00, but can work with earlier versions.\n\nIn addition, in 1989, a thirdAL, versions 8.1 and later, were freeware, and were compatible with GT Power versions 13.00 through 14.03.\n\n==The GT Power Network==\nAs the GT Power software application evolved to include a BBS host mode, P & M Software developed a Netmail Suite package which allowed registered users of GT Power to participate in the GT Power Network.  With this Netmail Suite, GT Power BBS systems could exchange netmail and echomail with each other.\n\nAs use of GT Power increased, the network grew.  At various times during the late 1980s/early 1990s, the Network included hundreds of nodes in the continental [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Hawaii]], [[China]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[Bermuda]], the [[Caribbean]] and much of [[Europe]].<ref>GT Power Network Historical Nodelist</ref>  The proprietary nature of the networking software, combined with the lack of easy-to-configure built-in support for other networking methods, has held the number of nodes below those found on [[Fidonet]].\n\nLike Fidonet, the GT Power Network offered both netmail and echomail. Where netmail is usually system-to-system, person-to-person mail, echomail was intended to be read & possibly replied to by users on all GT Power Network BBS systems.  Each echo had a different topic, such as politics, computer technical support, and ANSI art.  The GT Power Network's application of echomail was different from Fidonet in that echomail messages traveled back to the moderator's (or \"sponsor's\") BBS before being distributed to the rest of the network.  This had the advantage of allowing the moderator to review every message before it was allowed to echo to the rest of the network, creating the potential for a truly moderated echo conference.  On the downside, a slight disruption in network routing could cause active echos to appear quite stale.\n\nAround the beginning of 1990, there was a rift in the GT Power Network, resulting in the formation of a second network based on GT Power.  The ''Alliance of Free Sysops Network'', or ''AFSN'', was formed, with some GT Power sysops finding ways to participate in both networks.  By 1992, as AFSN sysops began migrating to other BBS software, the network had expanded to include both GT Power and QWK networking nodes, some of which had never run GT Power software.  The AFSN either folded, or merged with another QWK network, sometime in the late 1990s.\n\nLike many other BBS networks, as use of the Internet increased, the GT Power network began a decline.  Today, the GT Power Network continues on, albeit on a much smaller scale than before.  Many nodes on the network today participate in echomail via QWK networking as the former GT Power sysops have migrated to Windows and [[Linux]] native BBS applications.  These other applications do not support the GT Power proprietary mail programs.\n\n==GT Power today==\nMost GT Power sysops have either retired their BBS systems or have migrated to other applications.  Nearly all of the remaining GT Power Network BBS systems have replaced their dial-up networking with forms of mail transfer that take advantage of the Internet, by using either e-mail file attachments or some form of automated [[ftp]].\n\nAt least one dial-up GT Power BBS still exists in [[North America]].<ref>[http://www.bbsing.com/bbslists/bbslists.html The BBS Corner's US & Canada Dial-Up BBS Guide] via bbsing.com, and verified May 17, 2008</ref>  The [[Capitol City Online]] BBS, which has been online for over 20 years, currently offers both dial-up and telnet access to its callers.\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[List of BBS software]]\n* [[List of bulletin board systems]]\n* ''[[BBS: The Documentary]]''\n* [[ANSI art]]\n* [[terminal emulator|Terminal software]]\n* [[QWK (file format)]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.gtpowerbbs.com GT-Power Homepage], the new home page for GT-Power.\n*[http://members.iglou.com/mlp/cco Capitol City Online] homepage, a bbs running GT Power.\n*[http://home.clara.net/orac/gt.htm Paul Ratcliffe's GT Utilities page], home of third party companion programs ''Mailrun'' and ''PDQWK''.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Gt-Power}}\n[[Category:Bulletin board system software]]\n[[Category:DOS software]]\n", "text_old": "{{primary sources|date=July 2017}}\n{{Infobox software\n| name                   = GT-Power\n| logo                   = <!-- Image name is enough -->\n| logo alt               = \n| screenshot             = <!-- Image name is enough -->\n| caption                = \n| screenshot alt         = \n| collapsible            = \n| author                 = Paul Meiners\n| developer              = P & M Software\n| released               = 1980s<!-- {{Start date and age|YYYY|MM|DD|df=yes/no}} -->\n| discontinued           = \n| latest release version = \n| latest release date    = <!-- {{Start date and age|YYYY|MM|DD|df=yes/no}} -->\n| latest preview version = \n| latest preview date    = <!-- {{Start date and age|YYYY|MM|DD|df=yes/no}} -->\n| status                 = \n| programming language   = \n| operating system       = \n| platform               = [[MS-DOS]]\n| size                   = \n| language               = \n| language count         = <!-- Number only -->\n| language footnote      = \n| genre                  = [[bulletin board system]] (BBS), [[Plain old telephone service|dial-up telecommunications]]/terminal application\n| license                = \n| alexa                  = \n| website                = <!--{{URL|example.org}}-->\n| standard               = \n| AsOf                   = \n}}\n'''GT Power''' is a [[bulletin board system]] (BBS) and [[Plain old telephone service|dial-up telecommunications]]/terminal application for [[MS-DOS]].  It was first introduced in the 1980s by '''P & M Software''', founded by Paul Meiners. GT Power can be used both to host a BBS as well as to connect to other BBS systems via its full-featured dial-up \"terminal mode.\"  GT Power was a [[shareware]] package that required a registration fee in order to access its [[Proprietary software|proprietary]] [[computer network|network]] mail transport/handling software and, by default, the ''GT Power Network''.  The software is distributed in two \"flavors\"; a terminal-only version, nicknamed ''GTO'', and the full-featured host and terminal version.  \n\nThe [[source code]] for GT Power was sold twice during the late 1990s, again in 2008 and is currently the property of Tom Watt.{{fact|date=July 2017}}\n\nAlthough GT Power was written to run under DOS, it is also quite capable under the [[Microsoft Windows]] (versions with DOS support) and [[OS/2]] / [[eComStation]] [[operating systems]].  When it is running under OS/2 or eComStation, GT Power can also be used as a [[telnet]] BBS host and terminal program via use of an OS/2 shareware virtual [[modem]] application called [[VMODEM]].\n\n==History==\nGT Power was originally a telecommunications/terminal application, known as ''GT Powercomm'', which could be used to dial-up other BBS systems.  As time passed, a [[bulletin board system|host mode]] was written into the application which allowed the user to accept incoming data calls.  Before the release of version 13.00 (released Autumn, 1987), the host mode portion of the application had been expanded to become a full-blown BBS host application, complete with message and file areas, file [[uploading]] and [[downloading]], the capability to host [[BBS door]] programs, and a [[sysop]]-to-user chat mode.<ref>READ.ME file contained in GT 13.00 documentation.  As per the documentation, version 12.00 was the first version with an \"expanded\" host mode.</ref>\n\nThe name was shortened to ''GT Power'' sometime before the release of version 14.03 in the Autumn of 1988.\n\nWith version 13.00, P & M software began offering a proprietary ''Netmail Suite''; a set of  applications which allow GT Power BBS systems to connect and exchange routed person-to-person '''netmail'''.<ref>READ.ME file contained in GT 13.00 documentation</ref>  By the time version 14.03 was released, the suite was expanded to include the ability to also exchange '''echomail''' between systems,<ref>GT Power documentation</ref> similar to [[FidoNet]] echomail.  Upon registering GT Power, the user obtained a special [[password]] which enabled the Netmail Suite applications, and a [[key code]] that disabled any registration reminder delays in GT Power.\n\nThe Netmail Suite consisted of a mail transfer program and two mail handling programs.  The mail transfer program, called ''MDRIVer'', was used to dial other GT Power systems, to authenticate their identity, and to transfer mail between the two systems.  The mail handling programs were used to \"bag\" mail and prepare it for transfer (''MBAGger''), and to unpack received mail and distribute it to the proper message areas (''MDIST'').\n\nP & M  Software released its last version of GT Power, version 19.00, in September, 1994.  In mid-February, 1998, it was announced that P&M Software had sold the GT Power source code to '''New Millennium Software'''.  New Millennium renamed the project '''GT 2000''' but, by the end of April,  it was announced that New Millennium would not develop the product. The source was sold again to Dennis Berry, a GT Power sysop.\n\nIn late 1999, Berry released a [[Y2K]] [[bug fix]] for the Netmail Suite. A third party Y2K fix for the Suite, as well as other [[third party software component|third party companion software]], was also released. The GT Power application itself appeared to have no Y2K issues, with 19.00 being the latest release.\n\nThe source code and rights were sold to Tom Watt in June 2008 and he has resumed development of GT-Power. For the first time since Paul stopped development, the source code has been made to compile the EXEs as they were last released in 1994.\n\n==Features==\nThe following list of features applies to the most-recent version of GT Power (19.00).<ref>GT Power 19.00 documentation</ref>\n\nFeatures of both the terminal and host modes:\n\n* [[ANSI]] and [[VT-52]] [[terminal emulation]];\n* [[ANSI art|ANSI]] color graphics and music support that does not require [[ANSI.SYS]] (introduced version 12.20);\n* [[Remote Imaging Protocol|RIP]] graphics support (ver. 19.00);\n* support for multiple dialing directories, with up to 999 entries each (terminal mode);\n* circular dialing queue, and redial-on-busy (terminal mode);\n* a script language, for creating dialing and other scripts;\n* user-assignable function key/macro support;\n* built-in [[file transfer protocol|file-transfer protocols]], including [[Xmodem]], [[WXmodem]], [[Ymodem]], [[SEAlink]], [[Telink]], & MegaLink;\n* support for up to 18 additional \"external\" file-transfer protocols, such as [[Zmodem]] and [[HS/Link]];\n* support for non-standard [[COM port]]s (3-8), & non-standard IRQs (up to [[Interrupt request|IRQ]] 15);\n* support for 300-33.6k [[baud]] [[modems]], [[16550 UART]], and locked port speeds up to 115200;\n* [[DESQview]], DoubleDos, Windows, and OS/2 aware;\n* [[caller-id]] support;\n* optional capture mode and scroll-back buffering;\n* the ability to use PC-Pursuit<ref>PC Pursuit was a semi-nationwide network pay service which allowed BBS users to dial local numbers to access BBS systems that would otherwise be a long-distance telephone call.  The system being called had to be located in a city that was \"PC-Pursuitable.\"  PC-Pursuit would complete the call and connect the systems.</ref>  to make outgoing calls, both in terminal mode and with ''MDRIVer''.\n\nIn addition, the BBS host mode has the following features:\n\n* Built-in [[QWK (file format)|QWK]] mail and QWK networking support (non-proprietary);\n* semi-configurable menus and prompts;\n* support for multiple message areas (ver. 12.10) and file areas (prior to ver. 12.00);\n* proprietary Netmail Suite with netmail and echomail support (ver. 13.00);\n* full-screen ANSI message editing;\n* [[CD-ROM]] file area support;\n* FILE.DIZ support for file uploads;\n* multinode capable, on a network or under [[computer multitasking|multitasking]] software, such as DESQview or OS/2;\n* multinode ''CB'' chat (users can chat between nodes);\n* time banking;\n* threaded reading of messages;\n* Carbon-Copy list support in messages;\n* Return Receipt message support in netmail;\n* support for up to 999 external BBS door programs (ver. 19.00; doors introduced ver. 12.20);\n* mailboxes for private user-to-user mail exchange (ver. 19.00);\n* variable substitution and ''@ macros'' for bulletin and menu files;\n* user-configurable multiple language support;\n* user-configurable questionnaire/voting booth functions (ver. 12.20);\n* user-configurable automatic [[virus scan]] of uploaded files;\n* the ability to set up \"freebie\" file downloads and file areas;\n* user-configurable access levels and controls (introduced before ver. 12.00);\n* a task scheduler, for scheduling daily maintenance, etc. (ver. 13.00);\n* two distinct varieties of ''RINGBACK'' service, one of which allows sysops to run a BBS on a voice line (ver. 13.00);\n* a user maintenance program, called ''SYSOP'' (ver. 15.00);\n* the ability to accept a \"hand-off\" from front-end programs, such as [[Binkleyterm]].\n\nOther features can be added via the use of third-party software and add-ons.\n\n===Telnet use===\n\nGT Power also has the [[undocumented feature]] of [[telnet]] compatibility, in both BBS host and terminal mode, when used with a virtual modem software package called VMODEM under the OS/2 and eComStation operating systems.\n\n==Third party software==\nMany [[third party software component|third party software packages]] were developed to support the GT Power BBS.  Early distributions of GT Power included a third party application called ''GTCTL'', written by James Davis, followed later by ''Sysop Tools'',  written by Chris Smith.  Both were later replaced by the P & M ''SYSOP'' program.  Unlike SYSOP, Sysop Tools had an ANSI-style DOS graphic user interface.  All three were used mostly for user and control file maintenance.  Other third-party software includes:\n\n* external message readers, allowing the sysop to read & enter messages locally without [[logging into]] the BBS;\n* a QWK mail application, which could be added as a door or external menu option, that pre-dates and is more configurable than the built-in version (it could also be used for QWK networking);\n* [[Command line]]/[[batch file]] applications which allow GT Power systems to participate in Fidonet, [[RIME]], and QWK networking;\n* applications which create popular door drop file formats, such as DOORINF and [[DOOR.SYS]], allowing GT Power systems access to more BBS door software;\n* an application that allowed full-screen message editing, before it was included in GT Power;\n* an interface which allowed earlier GT Power systems to run the [[PCBoard]] door ''Prodoor'';\n* applications which allow GT Power systems to add [[Usenet]] [[newsgroups]] and [[Internet]] [[e-mail]] capability;\n* an application which allowed GT Power systems to exchange mail via Internet e-mail file attachments;\n* applications which allowed GT Power users to change their passwords online (since added to GT Power), as well as to force users to change passwords after a specified time;\n* various usage reporting applications;\n* various other applications.\n\nA third-party mail transfer program, called ''Mailrun'', was developed which allows GT Power Network systems to transfer mail using the bi-directional [[HS/Link]] protocol.  In theory, the use of the bi-directional protocol (which sent and received files at the same time) will shorten the length of dial-up netmail calls, saving the sysop some long-distance phone charges.  This program can be used as a replacement for the proprietary MDRIVer program, but requires the use of the proprietary MBAGger & MDIST programs.  With proper setup, Mailrun can co-exist with MDRIVer, allowing systems to use both programs to transfer mail.  Mailrun is [[freeware]], but does require a free key code from the developer in order to connect with other systems.  Mailrun is stated to be compatible with GT Power versions 17.00 through 19.00, but can work with earlier versions.\n\nIn addition, in 1989, a third-party mail handling application, called ''JDMAL'', was released.  It was developed by James Davis, who had previously worked with Meiners in developing the proprietary suite.  It could be used as a replacement for the proprietary MBAGger & MDIST  programs, but did not replace the MDRIVer program.  The last few releases of JDMAL, versions 8.1 and later, were freeware, and were compatible with GT Power versions 13.00 through 14.03.\n\n==The GT Power Network==\nAs the GT Power software application evolved to include a BBS host mode, P & M Software developed a Netmail Suite package which allowed registered users of GT Power to participate in the GT Power Network.  With this Netmail Suite, GT Power BBS systems could exchange netmail and echomail with each other.\n\nAs use of GT Power increased, the network grew.  At various times during the late 1980s/early 1990s, the Network included hundreds of nodes in the continental [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Hawaii]], [[China]], [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[Bermuda]], the [[Caribbean]] and much of [[Europe]].<ref>GT Power Network Historical Nodelist</ref>  The proprietary nature of the networking software, combined with the lack of easy-to-configure built-in support for other networking methods, has held the number of nodes below those found on [[Fidonet]].\n\nLike Fidonet, the GT Power Network offered both netmail and echomail. Where netmail is usually system-to-system, person-to-person mail, echomail was intended to be read & possibly replied to by users on all GT Power Network BBS systems.  Each echo had a different topic, such as politics, computer technical support, and ANSI art.  The GT Power Network's application of echomail was different from Fidonet in that echomail messages traveled back to the moderator's (or \"sponsor's\") BBS before being distributed to the rest of the network.  This had the advantage of allowing the moderator to review every message before it was allowed to echo to the rest of the network, creating the potential for a truly moderated echo conference.  On the downside, a slight disruption in network routing could cause active echos to appear quite stale.\n\nAround the beginning of 1990, there was a rift in the GT Power Network, resulting in the formation of a second network based on GT Power.  The ''Alliance of Free Sysops Network'', or ''AFSN'', was formed, with some GT Power sysops finding ways to participate in both networks.  By 1992, as AFSN sysops began migrating to other BBS software, the network had expanded to include both GT Power and QWK networking nodes, some of which had never run GT Power software.  The AFSN either folded, or merged with another QWK network, sometime in the late 1990s.\n\nLike many other BBS networks, as use of the Internet increased, the GT Power network began a decline.  Today, the GT Power Network continues on, albeit on a much smaller scale than before.  Many nodes on the network today participate in echomail via QWK networking as the former GT Power sysops have migrated to Windows and [[Linux]] native BBS applications.  These other applications do not support the GT Power proprietary mail programs.\n\n==GT Power today==\nMost GT Power sysops have either retired their BBS systems or have migrated to other applications.  Nearly all of the remaining GT Power Network BBS systems have replaced their dial-up networking with forms of mail transfer that take advantage of the Internet, by using either e-mail file attachments or some form of automated [[ftp]].\n\nAt least one dial-up GT Power BBS still exists in [[North America]].<ref>[http://www.bbsing.com/bbslists/bbslists.html The BBS Corner's US & Canada Dial-Up BBS Guide] via bbsing.com, and verified May 17, 2008</ref>  The [[Capitol City Online]] BBS, which has been online for over 20 years, currently offers both dial-up and telnet access to its callers.\n\n==See also==\n{{div col|colwidth=25em}}\n* [[List of BBS software]]\n* [[List of bulletin board systems]]\n* ''[[BBS: The Documentary]]''\n* [[ANSI art]]\n* [[terminal emulator|Terminal software]]\n* [[QWK (file format)]]\n{{div col end}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.gtpowerbbs.com GT-Power Homepage], the new home page for GT-Power.\n*[http://members.iglou.com/mlp/cco Capitol City Online] homepage, a bbs running GT Power.\n*[http://home.clara.net/orac/gt.htm Paul Ratcliffe's GT Utilities page], home of third party companion programs ''Mailrun'' and ''PDQWK''.\n\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Gt-Power}}\n[[Category:Bulletin board system software]]\n[[Category:DOS software]]\n", "name_user": "111.119.187.18", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GT-Power"}
