The halberd was officially discarded and the shorter axe reintroduced by royal decree in 1844, when an authorized rendering was instituted for the first time.

In the late [[Middle Ages]], the [[Dane Axe|axe]] handle gradually grew longer and came to resemble a [[halberd]]. The handle was usually curved in order to fit the shape of shield preferred at the time, and also to match the shape of coins. The halberd was officially discarded and the shorter axe reintroduced by royal decree in 1844, when an authorized rendering was instituted for the first time. In 1905 the official design for royal and government arms was again changed, this time reverting to the medieval pattern, with a triangular shield and a more upright lion.<ref name=\"coa\"/>\n\nThe coat of arms of the royal house as well as the [[Royal Standard of Norway|Royal Standard]] uses the lion design from 1905.

Grateful Dead members have said that it was after attending a concert by the touring New York City band [[the Lovin' Spoonful]] that they decided to \"go electric\" and look for a dirtier sound. [[Jerry Garcia]] and [[Bob Weir]] (each of whom had been immersed in the [[American folk music revival]] of the late 1950s and early 1960s), were open-minded to electric guitars.\n\nThe Grateful Dead's early music (in the mid-1960s) was part of the process of establishing what \"[[psychedelic music]]\" was, but theirs was essentially a \"street party\" form of it. They developed their \"psychedelic\" playing as a result of meeting [[Ken Kesey]] in [[Palo Alto, California]], and subsequently becoming the house band for the [[Acid Tests]] he staged.<ref>[[Tom Wolfe|Wolfe, Tom]] (1968). ''[[The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test]]'', Farrar Straus & Giroux</ref> They did not fit their music to an established category such as pop rock, blues, folk rock, or country & western. Individual tunes within their repertoire could be identified under one of these stylistic labels, but overall their music drew on all of these genres and, more frequently, melded several of them. [[Bill Graham (promoter)|Bill Graham]] said of the Grateful Dead, \"They're not the best at what they do, they're the only ones that do what they do.\"<ref>{{cite web|author=Bjerklie, Steve|url=http://www.metroactive.com/papers/sfmetro/03.97/rock-art-97-3.html|title=What are They Worth?|publisher=Metroactive.com|accessdate=July 16, 2011|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110515181358/http://www.metroactive.com/papers/sfmetro/03.97/rock-art-97-3.html|archivedate=May 15, 2011}}</ref> Often (both in performance and on recording) the Dead left room for exploratory, spacey soundscapes.\n\nTheir live shows, fed by an improvisational approach to music, were different from most touring bands. While rock and roll bands often rehearse a standard set, played with minor variations, the Grateful Dead did not prepare in this way. Garcia stated in a 1966 interview, \"We don't make up our sets beforehand. We'd rather work off the tops of our heads than off a piece of paper.\"<ref name=\"The Grateful Dead p. 17\">The Grateful Dead: Playing in the Band, David Gans and Peter Simon, St Martin Press, 1985 p. 17</ref> They maintained this approach throughout their career. For each performance, the band drew material from an active list of a hundred or so songs.<ref name=\"The Grateful Dead p. 17\"/>\n\nThe 1969 live album ''[[Live/Dead]]'' did capture the band in-form, but commercial success did not come until ''[[Workingman's Dead]]'' and ''[[American Beauty (album)|American Beauty]]'', both released in 1970. These records largely featured the band's laid-back [[acoustic music]]ianship and more traditional song structures.

Weir, too, was not a traditional rhythm guitarist, but tended to play jazz-influenced, unique inversions at the upper end of the Dead's sound. The two drummers, [[Mickey Hart]] and Kreutzmann, developed a unique, complex interplay, balancing Kreutzmann's steady beat with Hart's interest in percussion styles outside the rock tradition. Hart incorporated an 11-count measure to his drumming, bringing a dimension to the band's sound that became an important part of its style.<ref>Cavallo, Dominick.

After Stanley went to jail for manufacturing LSD in 1970, the group briefly used house PAs, but found them to be even less reliable than those built by their former soundman.

[[Ron \"Pigpen\" McKernan]] played [[Hammond organ|keyboards]] and [[harmonica]] until shortly before his death in 1973 at the age of 27. Garcia, Weir, and McKernan shared the lead vocal duties more or less equally; Lesh only sang a few leads, but his tenor was a key part of the band's three-part vocal harmonies. [[Bill Kreutzmann]] played [[drum]]s, and in September 1967 was joined by a second drummer, New York City native [[Mickey Hart]], who also played a wide variety of other [[percussion instrument]]s.\n\n1970 included tour dates in [[New Orleans, Louisiana]], where the band performed at [[The Warehouse (New Orleans)|The Warehouse]] for two nights.

Eventually, the charges were dismissed, except those against sound engineer [[Owsley Stanley]], who was already facing charges in California for manufacturing LSD. This event was later memorialized in the lyrics of the song \"[[Truckin']]\", a single from ''American Beauty'' which reached number 64 on the charts.\n\nMickey Hart took time off from the Grateful Dead beginning in February 1971,<ref>{{cite web|last=Planer|first=Lindsay|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/rolling-thunder-r102792/review|title=''Rolling Thunder:'' Review|work=AllMusic|accessdate=April 6, 2015}}</ref> leaving Kreutzmann once again as the sole percussionist. Hart rejoined the Grateful Dead for good in October 1974. [[Tom Constanten|Tom \"TC\" Constanten]] was added as a second keyboardist from 1968 to 1970, while Pigpen also played various percussion instruments and sang.\n\nAfter Constanten's departure, Pigpen reclaimed his position as sole keyboardist.

Grateful Dead members have said that it was after attending a concert by the touring New York City band [[the Lovin' Spoonful]] that they decided to \"go electric\" and look for a dirtier sound. [[Jerry Garcia]] and [[Bob Weir]] (each of whom had been immersed in the [[American folk music revival]] of the late 1950s and early 1960s), were open-minded to electric guitars.\n\nThe Grateful Dead's early music (in the mid-1960s) was part of the process of establishing what \"[[psychedelic music]]\" was, but theirs was essentially a \"street party\" form of it. They developed their \"psychedelic\" playing as a result of meeting [[Ken Kesey]] in [[Palo Alto, California]], and subsequently becoming the house band for the [[Acid Tests]] he staged.<ref>[[Tom Wolfe|Wolfe, Tom]] (1968). ''[[The Electric Kool-Aid Acid Test]]'', Farrar Straus & Giroux</ref> They did not fit their music to an established category such as pop rock, blues, folk rock, or country & western. Individual tunes within their repertoire could be identified under one of these stylistic labels, but overall their music drew on all of these genres and, more frequently, melded several of them. [[Bill Graham (promoter)|Bill Graham]] said of the Grateful Dead, \"They're not the best at what they do, they're the only ones that do what they do.\"<ref>{{cite web|author=Bjerklie, Steve|url=http://www.metroactive.com/papers/sfmetro/03.97/rock-art-97-3.html|title=What are They Worth?|publisher=Metroactive.com|accessdate=July 16, 2011|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110515181358/http://www.metroactive.com/papers/sfmetro/03.97/rock-art-97-3.html|archivedate=May 15, 2011}}</ref> Often (both in performance and on recording) the Dead left room for exploratory, spacey soundscapes.\n\nTheir live shows, fed by an improvisational approach to music, were different from most touring bands. While rock and roll bands often rehearse a standard set, played with minor variations, the Grateful Dead did not prepare in this way. Garcia stated in a 1966 interview, \"We don't make up our sets beforehand. We'd rather work off the tops of our heads than off a piece of paper.\"<ref name=\"The Grateful Dead p. 17\">The Grateful Dead: Playing in the Band, David Gans and Peter Simon, St Martin Press, 1985 p. 17</ref> They maintained this approach throughout their career.

These records largely featured the band's laid-back [[acoustic music]]ianship and more traditional song structures.

Lesh, who was originally a classically trained trumpet player with an extensive background in music theory, did not tend to play traditional blues-based bass forms, but more melodic, symphonic and complex lines, often sounding like a second lead guitar. Weir, too, was not a traditional rhythm guitarist, but tended to play jazz-influenced, unique inversions at the upper end of the Dead's sound. The two drummers, [[Mickey Hart]] and Kreutzmann, developed a unique, complex interplay, balancing Kreutzmann's steady beat with Hart's interest in percussion styles outside the rock tradition. Hart incorporated an 11-count measure to his drumming, bringing a dimension to the band's sound that became an important part of its style.<ref>Cavallo, Dominick.

The band was also famous for its extended musical improvisations, having been described as having never played the same song the same way twice. Their concert sets often blended songs, one into the next (a [[segue]]).\n\n===Concert sound systems===\nThe [[Wall of Sound (Grateful Dead)|Wall of Sound]] was a large sound system designed specifically for the band.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.pechner.smugmug.com/gallery/2383161|title=Pechner Productions- powered by SmugMug|publisher=Pechner.smugmug.com|accessdate=July 16, 2011|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091125144654/http://www.pechner.smugmug.com/gallery/2383161|archivedate=November 25, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.alembic.com/family/history.html|title=Alembic History&nbsp;\u2013 Long Version|publisher=Alembic.com|date=August 22, 2001|accessdate=July 16, 2011|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110712132709/http://alembic.com/family/history.html|archivedate=July 12, 2011}}</ref> The band was never satisfied with the house system anywhere they played.

Stanley was the Grateful Dead's soundman for many years; he was also one of the largest suppliers of [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD]].<ref>McNally, Dennis, \"A Long Strange Trip\", New York 2002, pp. 118\u201319. {{ISBN|0-7679-1185-7}} and Brightman, Carol, \"Sweet Chaos\", New York 1998, pp. 100\u201304. {{ISBN|0-671-01117-0}}</ref> Stanley's sound systems were delicate and finicky, and frequently brought shows to a halt with technical breakdowns. After Stanley went to jail for manufacturing LSD in 1970, the group briefly used house PAs, but found them to be even less reliable than those built by their former soundman. On February 2, 1970, the group contacted [[Bob Heil]] to use his system.<ref name=\"performing\">{{cite news|url=http://www.performing-musician.com/pm/dec08/articles/bobheil.htm?print=yes#top|title=The Night that Modern Live Sound Was Born: Bob Heil and the Grateful Dead|last=Daley|first=Dan|date=December 2008|publisher=Performing Musician|accessdate=May 7, 2011}}</ref> In 1971, the band purchased their first [[solid state (electronics)|solid-state]] sound system from [[Alembic Inc]] Studios. Because of this, Alembic would play an integral role in the research, development, and production of the Wall of Sound. The band also welcomed [[Dan Healy (soundman)|Dan Healy]] into the fold on a permanent basis that year. Healy would mix the Grateful Dead's live sound until 1993.\n\n===Tapes===\nLike several other bands during this time, the Grateful Dead allowed their fans to record their shows. For many years the [[Taper (concert)|tapers]] set up their microphones wherever they could, and the eventual forest of microphones became a problem for the sound crew. Eventually, this was solved by having a dedicated taping section located behind the [[Sound board (music)|soundboard]], which required a special \"tapers\" ticket. The band allowed sharing of tapes of their shows, as long as no profits were made on the sale of their show tapes.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/GratefulDead|title=Internet Archive: Grateful Dead|accessdate=July 16, 2011|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719012925/http://www.archive.org/details/GratefulDead|archivedate=July 19, 2011}}</ref> Sometimes the sound crew would allow the tapers to connect directly to the soundboard, which created exceptional recordings.<ref name=\"Archive.org\">{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/iathreads/post-view.php?id=47634|title=Internet Archive Forums: Grateful Dead concert recordings on the Internet Archive|accessdate=February 25, 2015|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091001075250/http://www.archive.org/iathreads/post-view.php?id=47634|archivedate=October 1, 2009}}</ref>\n\nRecently, there have been some disputes over which recordings [[Internet Archive|archive.org]] could host on their site.

Sullivan's drawing was an illustration for a 1913 edition of the ''[[Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam]]''. Earlier antecedents include the custom of exhibiting the relic skulls of Christian martyrs decorated with roses on their feast days. The rose is an attribute of [[Saint Valentine]], who according to one legend, was martyred by decapitation. Accordingly, in Rome, at the church dedicated to him, the observance of his feast day included the display of his skull surrounded by roses.<ref>{{cite book|title=Rome: A Holiday Magazine Travel Guide|publisher=Random House|location=New York|date=1960}}</ref> Kelley and Mouse's design originally appeared on a poster for the September 16 and 17, 1966, Dead shows at the [[Avalon Ballroom]].<ref>{{cite news|author=du Lac, J.

From time to time, it published the texts of historic documents and the addresses delivered at its annual meetings. This was hampered, however, by having virtually no endowment and no permanent home. In 1848, the institution shortened its cumbersome name to the Virginia Historical Society to reflect a primarily historical focus as it became more active in publishing historical material.<ref name=\"Urofsky\" /> The society gained its first permanent headquarters building in Richmond in 1893. The society's journal, the ''Virginia Magazine of History and Biography'', has published on a quarterly basis without interruption since 1893.\n\nIn the 1950s, increasing resources allowed the addition of a professional staff. Over the next several decades the society's collections grew. The publications program also increased as the institution gained a significant role in the academic community.\n\nIn 1959, the historical society relocated from its headquarters in the [[Stewart-Lee House|Lee House]] on Franklin Street to Battle Abbey (constructed in 1912) on the Boulevard. To accommodate the society, a four-story wing was added to the west side of the previously expanded Battle Abbey. Since 1959, the headquarters building has been renovated and expanded several times\u2014including a new west wing to house the extensive society research library (1992); a north wing to expand its gallery space and house offices of the [[Virginia Department of Historic Resources]] (1998); a new south wing to add additional gallery space, storage, offices, and a nearly 488-seat auditorium (2006); and new spaces for public use on the north and south sides of the building (2015).\n\nIn 1992, the society opened the Center for Virginia History, increasing its display and archival resources. Shortly thereafter, it entered into a partnership with the Virginia Department of Historic Resources,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dhr.virginia.gov/ |title=Virginia Department of Historic Resources |website=Dhr.virginia.gov |accessdate=November 22, 2016}}</ref> an agency of the state government, which also had significant historical holdings (both artifacts and archives), forming a unique private-public partnership.\n\nIn 2018, after nearly a year of research, community conversations, and strategic planning, the Virginia Historical Society announced a new name for its headquarters facility at 428 N.

By collecting, preserving, and interpreting the Commonwealth's history, the society links past with present and inspires future generations.\n\n==History==\nOn December 29, 1831, twenty-eight Virginians\u2014consisting of political, economic, and social leaders\u2014met in the House of Delegates chamber of the Virginia State Capitol to establish a state historical society.<ref name=\"Urofsky\">{{cite book |last1=Urofsky |first1=Melvin I. |title=The Virginia Historical Society: The First 175 Years, 1831-2006 |date=2006 |publisher=Virginia Historical Society |isbn=0-945015-25-9 |pages=20\u201321, 42 }}</ref> Christened the Virginia Historical and Philosophical Society, the new institution's mission was to preserve the memory of the commonwealth's prominent colonial and Revolutionary past at a time when Virginia was experiencing the movement of many of its citizens out of the state, which contributed to a growing sense of social upheaval and a perceived disconnection with Virginia's \u201cgolden age.\u201d To give the new historical society a boost from the very beginning, its founders elected Chief Justice John Marshall as its first president and former president James Madison its first honorary member.\n\nIn its early years, the historical society gathered an eclectic collection of natural history specimens, historical artifacts, and printed and written material. From time to time, it published the texts of historic documents and the addresses delivered at its annual meetings. This was hampered, however, by having virtually no endowment and no permanent home. In 1848, the institution shortened its cumbersome name to the Virginia Historical Society to reflect a primarily historical focus as it became more active in publishing historical material.<ref name=\"Urofsky\" /> The society gained its first permanent headquarters building in Richmond in 1893. The society's journal, the ''Virginia Magazine of History and Biography'', has published on a quarterly basis without interruption since 1893.\n\nIn the 1950s, increasing resources allowed the addition of a professional staff. Over the next several decades the society's collections grew. The publications program also increased as the institution gained a significant role in the academic community.\n\nIn 1959, the historical society relocated from its headquarters in the [[Stewart-Lee House|Lee House]] on Franklin Street to Battle Abbey (constructed in 1912) on the Boulevard. To accommodate the society, a four-story wing was added to the west side of the previously expanded Battle Abbey. Since 1959, the headquarters building has been renovated and expanded several times\u2014including a new west wing to house the extensive society research library (1992); a north wing to expand its gallery space and house offices of the [[Virginia Department of Historic Resources]] (1998); a new south wing to add additional gallery space, storage, offices, and a nearly 488-seat auditorium (2006); and new spaces for public use on the north and south sides of the building (2015).\n\nIn 1992, the society opened the Center for Virginia History, increasing its display and archival resources. Shortly thereafter, it entered into a partnership with the Virginia Department of Historic Resources,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.dhr.virginia.gov/ |title=Virginia Department of Historic Resources |website=Dhr.virginia.gov |accessdate=November 22, 2016}}</ref> an agency of the state government, which also had significant historical holdings (both artifacts and archives), forming a unique private-public partnership.\n\nIn 2018, after nearly a year of research, community conversations, and strategic planning, the Virginia Historical Society announced a new name for its headquarters facility at 428 N. Boulevard in Richmond, Virginia\u2014The Virginia Museum of History & Culture.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Curran |first1=Colleen |title=Virginia Historical Society unveils new name after 186 years of stories: Virginia Museum of History & Culture |url=https://www.richmond.com/entertainment/museums/virginia-historical-society-unveils-new-name-after-years-of-stories/article_7c041dee-f902-57ee-83f7-fd396e4bab70.html |accessdate=1 August 2018 |work=Richmond Times-Dispatch |date=February 14, 2018}}</ref>\n\nIn 2019, the street on which the Virginia Museum of History & Culture is located was renamed Arthur Ashe Boulevard in honor of [[Arthur Ashe]].

Weddell]], U.S. ambassador to Spain and Argentina, and his wife, Virginia Weddell, in 1928 from the materials of a 16th-century English manor house previously standing in [[Warwick]]. It was a blend of three romantic English Tudor designs, and, for its time, was a thoroughly modern home complete with seven full baths, central heat, modern kitchen, and commodious closets.\n\nNow owned and operated by the Virginia Historical Society as a museum, the house has been preserved much as it was when the Weddells resided there. The gardens and grounds of Virginia House provide a rich tapestry of texture and color throughout the year. Today, close to 1,000 types of ornamental plants thrive throughout formal and naturalistic gardens.\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n(Information paraphrased from the Virginia Historical Society web site - see external link below)\n*[http://www.vahistorical.org/vh/vh_house_main.htm Virginia House]\n*[http://www.wikimapia.org/#lat=37.552947&lon=-77.503556&z=17&l=0&m=a&v=2&show=/5278539/Virginia_House Wikimapia Map by Google]\n\n==External links==\n* [http://www.VirginiaHistory.org/ Virginia Historical Society web site]\n* [https://www.virginiahistory.org/collections/virginia-magazine-history-biography ''Virginia Magazine of History and Biography'']\n* [http://southernspaces.org/2011/turning-point-richmond-virginia-historical-societys-civil-war-exhibition A Turning Point for Richmond: The Virginia Historical Society's Civil War Exhibition], a review of an exhibition at the Virginia Historical Society by William G.

The show was later renamed ''[[Seinfeld]]'' to avoid confusion with the short-lived teen sitcom ''The Marshall Chronicles''. By its third season, it had become the most watched sitcom on American television. The final episode aired in 1998, and the show has been a popular [[Television syndication|syndicated]] re-run. Along with Seinfeld, the show starred ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' veteran [[Julia Louis-Dreyfus]] and experienced actors [[Michael Richards]] and [[Jason Alexander]]. Alexander played George, a caricature of [[Larry David]].

In the \"Seinfeld Season 6\" DVD set, commenting on the episode \"[[The Gymnast]]\", Seinfeld cited [[Jean Shepherd]] as an influence, saying, \"He really formed my entire comedic sensibility\u2014I learned how to do comedy from Jean Shepherd.\" From 2004 to 2007, the former ''Seinfeld'' cast and crew recorded audio commentaries for episodes of the DVD releases of the show.\n\n===Post-''Seinfeld''===\nAfter he ended his sitcom, Seinfeld returned to [[New York City]] to make a comeback with his [[stand-up comedy]] rather than stay in [[Los Angeles]] and continue his acting career. In 1998 he went on tour and recorded a comedy special, titled ''[[I'm Telling You for the Last Time]]''. The process of developing and performing new material at clubs around the world was chronicled in a 2002 documentary, ''[[Comedian (film)|Comedian]]'', which also featured fellow comic [[Orny Adams]] and was directed by Christian Charles. Seinfeld has written several books, mostly archives of past routines. In the late 1990s, [[Apple Computer]] came up with the advertising slogan \"[[Think different]]\" and produced a 60-second commercial to promote the slogan. This commercial showed people who were able to \"think differently\", such as [[Albert Einstein]], [[Mahatma Gandhi]], [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], and many others. It was later cut short to 30 seconds and altered such that Seinfeld was included at the end, whereas he had not been in the original cut.

The show was later renamed ''[[Seinfeld]]'' to avoid confusion with the short-lived teen sitcom ''The Marshall Chronicles''. By its third season, it had become the most watched sitcom on American television. The final episode aired in 1998, and the show has been a popular [[Television syndication|syndicated]] re-run. Along with Seinfeld, the show starred ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' veteran [[Julia Louis-Dreyfus]] and experienced actors [[Michael Richards]] and [[Jason Alexander]]. Alexander played George, a caricature of [[Larry David]].

In the \"Seinfeld Season 6\" DVD set, commenting on the episode \"[[The Gymnast]]\", Seinfeld cited [[Jean Shepherd]] as an influence, saying, \"He really formed my entire comedic sensibility\u2014I learned how to do comedy from Jean Shepherd.\" From 2004 to 2007, the former ''Seinfeld'' cast and crew recorded audio commentaries for episodes of the DVD releases of the show.\n\n===Post-''Seinfeld''===\nAfter he ended his sitcom, Seinfeld returned to [[New York City]] to make a comeback with his [[stand-up comedy]] rather than stay in [[Los Angeles]] and continue his acting career. In 1998 he went on tour and recorded a comedy special, titled ''[[I'm Telling You for the Last Time]]''. The process of developing and performing new material at clubs around the world was chronicled in a 2002 documentary, ''[[Comedian (film)|Comedian]]'', which also featured fellow comic [[Orny Adams]] and was directed by Christian Charles. Seinfeld has written several books, mostly archives of past routines. In the late 1990s, [[Apple Computer]] came up with the advertising slogan \"[[Think different]]\" and produced a 60-second commercial to promote the slogan. This commercial showed people who were able to \"think differently\", such as [[Albert Einstein]], [[Mahatma Gandhi]], [[Martin Luther King Jr.]], and many others. It was later cut short to 30 seconds and altered such that Seinfeld was included at the end, whereas he had not been in the original cut.
