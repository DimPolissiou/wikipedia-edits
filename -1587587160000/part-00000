The Janata alliance, with [[Jai Prakash Narayan]] as its spiritual guide, claimed the elections were the last chance for India to choose between \"democracy and dictatorship\". The Congress Party split during the election campaign of 1977: veteran Gandhi supporters like [[Jagjivan Ram]], [[Hemvati Nandan Bahuguna]] and [[Nandini Satpathy]] were compelled to part ways and form a new political entity, the CFD ([[Congress for Democracy]]), due primarily to intra-party politicking and the circumstances created by Sanjay Gandhi. The prevailing rumour was that he intended to dislodge Gandhi, and the trio stood to prevent that. Gandhi's Congress party was soundly crushed in the elections.

The main reason was the perceived bias of the United States and [[China]], rivals of the USSR, towards Pakistan. The support of the Soviets with arms supplies and the casting of a veto at the United Nations helped in winning and consolidating the victory over Pakistan in the 1971 Bangladesh liberation war. Before the war, Gandhi signed a treaty of friendship with the Soviets. They were unhappy with the 1974 nuclear test conducted by India but did not support further action because of the ensuing Cold War with the United States. Gandhi was unhappy with the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, but once again calculations involving relations with Pakistan and China kept her from criticising the Soviet Union harshly. The Soviets became the main arms supplier during the Gandhi years by offering cheap credit and transactions in rupees rather than in dollars. The easy trade deals also applied to non-military goods. Under Gandhi, by the early 1980s, the Soviets had become India's largest trading partner.<ref name=\"British Academic Press\">{{cite book|last1=Light|first1=Margot (Editor)|last2=Duncan|first2=Peter J.S.

Gandhi not only abandoned the short-lived liberalisation programme but also aggressively expanded the public sector with new licensing requirements and other restrictions for industry. She began a new course by launching the Fourth Five-Year Plan in 1969. The government targeted growth at 5.7% while stating as its goals, \"growth with stability and progressive achievement of self-reliance.\"{{sfn|Malik|1988|p=60-72}}<ref name=\"Gupta\">{{Cite book| publisher = Deep and Deep Publications| page = 7|url={{Googlebooks|8D0iS_EF8_AC|page=PA7|keywords=|text=|plainurl=yes}}|isbn=978-8176295598| last = Gupta| first =  K.

The programme emphasised greater state control of the economy with the understanding that government control assured greater welfare than private control.{{sfn|Malik|1988|p=60-72}} Related to this point were a set of policies which were meant to regulate the private sector.{{sfn|Malik|1988|p=60-72}} By the end of the 1960s, the reversal of the liberalisation process was complete, and India's policies were characterised as \"protectionist as ever.\"<ref name=\"Kirk\"/>\n\nTo deal with India's food problems, Gandhi expanded the emphasis on production of inputs to agriculture that had already been initiated by her father, Jawaharlal Nehru.<ref name=\"Rosser\"/> The [[Green Revolution in India]] subsequently culminated under her government in the 1970s. It transformed the country from a nation heavily reliant on imported grains, and prone to famine, to one largely able to feed itself, and becoming successful in achieving its goal of food security. Gandhi had a personal motive in pursuing agricultural self-sufficiency, having found India's dependency on the U.S. for shipments of grains humiliating.<ref>{{cite book|first=Maya|last=Chadda|title=Building Democracy in South Asia|location=London|publisher=[[Lynne Rienner Publishers]]|year=2000|page=150|isbn=978-1555878597}}</ref>\n\nThe economic period of 1967\u201375 became significant for its major wave of nationalisation amidst increased regulation of the private sector.<ref name=\"Rosser\"/>\n\nSome other objectives of the economic plan for the period were to provide for the minimum needs of the community through a rural works program and the removal of the privy purses of the nobility.{{sfn|Malik|1988|p=60-72}} Both these, and many other goals of the 1967 programme, were accomplished by 1974\u201375.

The main reason was the perceived bias of the United States and [[China]], rivals of the USSR, towards Pakistan. The support of the Soviets with arms supplies and the casting of a veto at the United Nations helped in winning and consolidating the victory over Pakistan in the 1971 Bangladesh liberation war. Before the war, Gandhi signed a treaty of friendship with the Soviets. They were unhappy with the 1974 nuclear test conducted by India but did not support further action because of the ensuing Cold War with the United States. Gandhi was unhappy with the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, but once again calculations involving relations with Pakistan and China kept her from criticising the Soviet Union harshly. The Soviets became the main arms supplier during the Gandhi years by offering cheap credit and transactions in rupees rather than in dollars. The easy trade deals also applied to non-military goods. Under Gandhi, by the early 1980s, the Soviets had become India's largest trading partner.<ref name=\"British Academic Press\">{{cite book|last1=Light|first1=Margot (Editor)|last2=Duncan|first2=Peter J.S.

Gandhi not only abandoned the short-lived liberalisation programme but also aggressively expanded the public sector with new licensing requirements and other restrictions for industry. She began a new course by launching the Fourth Five-Year Plan in 1969. The government targeted growth at 5.7% while stating as its goals, \"growth with stability and progressive achievement of self-reliance.\"{{sfn|Malik|1988|p=60-72}}<ref name=\"Gupta\">{{Cite book| publisher = Deep and Deep Publications| page = 7|url={{Googlebooks|8D0iS_EF8_AC|page=PA7|keywords=|text=|plainurl=yes}}|isbn=978-8176295598| last = Gupta| first =  K.

This had been her first economic policy formulation, six months after coming to office. The programme emphasised greater state control of the economy with the understanding that government control assured greater welfare than private control.{{sfn|Malik|1988|p=60-72}} Related to this point were a set of policies which were meant to regulate the private sector.{{sfn|Malik|1988|p=60-72}} By the end of the 1960s, the reversal of the liberalisation process was complete, and India's policies were characterised as \"protectionist as ever.\"<ref name=\"Kirk\"/>\n\nTo deal with India's food problems, Gandhi expanded the emphasis on production of inputs to agriculture that had already been initiated by her father, Jawaharlal Nehru.<ref name=\"Rosser\"/> The [[Green Revolution in India]] subsequently culminated under her government in the 1970s. It transformed the country from a nation heavily reliant on imported grains, and prone to famine, to one largely able to feed itself, and becoming successful in achieving its goal of food security. Gandhi had a personal motive in pursuing agricultural self-sufficiency, having found India's dependency on the U.S. for shipments of grains humiliating.<ref>{{cite book|first=Maya|last=Chadda|title=Building Democracy in South Asia|location=London|publisher=[[Lynne Rienner Publishers]]|year=2000|page=150|isbn=978-1555878597}}</ref>\n\nThe economic period of 1967\u201375 became significant for its major wave of nationalisation amidst increased regulation of the private sector.<ref name=\"Rosser\"/>\n\nSome other objectives of the economic plan for the period were to provide for the minimum needs of the community through a rural works program and the removal of the privy purses of the nobility.{{sfn|Malik|1988|p=60-72}} Both these, and many other goals of the 1967 programme, were accomplished by 1974\u201375.

She argued the case for abolition based on equal rights for all citizens and the need to reduce the government's revenue deficit. The nobility responded by rallying around the Jana Sangh and other right-wing parties that stood in opposition to Gandhi's attempts to abolish royal privileges.<ref name=\"Jaffrelot\"/> The motion to abolish privy purses, and the official recognition of the titles, was originally brought before the Parliament in 1970. It was passed in the Lok Sabha but fell short of the two-thirds majority in the Rajya Sabha by a single vote.{{sfn|Jayakar|1997|p=214}} Gandhi responded by having a [[Presidential proclamation]] issued; de-recognising the princes; with this withdrawal of recognition, their claims to privy purses were also legally lost.{{sfn|Jayakar|1997|p=214}} However, the proclamation was struck down by the [[Supreme Court of India]].{{sfn|Jayakar|1997|p=214}} In 1971, Gandhi again motioned to abolish the privy purse.

The political economist, Jyotindra Das Gupta, cryptically questioned \"...whether or not the real supporters of land-holders were in jail or in power?\"<ref name=\"Jaffrelot\"/> Critics also accused Gandhi of choosing to \"talk left and act right\", referring to her concurrent pro-business decisions and endeavours.<ref name=\"Jaffrelot\"/> [[J.

K. Rowling]] written in the 1990s, following the adventures of a wizard boy named Harry Potter, his friends, and life at the [[Fiction|fictional]] magic school, [[Hogwarts]]. Only in this story, Harry is but merely a side character. This story focuses on the Puffs, a group of students who were there too but were only seen as the unwanted students. But together, the Puffs gather their few strengths in the time of need.{{Infobox Musical|name=Puffs|image_size=|caption=|subtitle=Or: Seven Increasingly Eventful Years At A Certain School Of Magic And Magic|book=Matt Cox|basis=''[[Harry Potter]]''<br> by [[J. K. Rowling]]|premiere_date=July 2, 2015|premiere_location=The [[Peoples Improv Theater]]: [[New York City, New York]]|productions=2015 [[Off-Off Broadway]]<br>2016 [[Off-Broadway]]<br>2019 [[Sydney, Australia]]|image=PuffsPlay.jpg}}\n\n== Background ==\nCox told [[SyFy Wire]] that he was currently working on another show he had written and worked on with McCarthy called \"Kapow - i GoGo\", a play split into three parts that ran about 4.5 hours when put together about different nerdy cartoons, franchises, and \"sci-fi stuff\" (Cox's words). He tells reporter, Lisa Granshaw, that he came up with the idea for Puffs on a subway ride one night home. He thought to himself \"it would've been really terrible to be another student at that particular magic school whenever Harry was there.\" The whole ride home, he thought about that idea and how every year something bad would happen all because of Potter. He then began to piece together some other ideas from 90's pop-culture references and funny movie flaws that could be an entertaining play. As he began to think about it more, he thought about how easy it would be to sell to \"anyone who has never been destined to save the world\" (words from the [[BroadwayHD]] description of the show).\n\n\"Soon after,\" he says, \"we did a reading, which was fun to put together. We kept tweaking it until we moved from the People's Improv Theater to the Elektra and now New World Stages, and it's been a fun time.\" He told Granshaw that the hardest part about creating the show was to cram seven books, movies, and all the humor into a show that actually wouldn't run for five hours (a line said by the narrator in the beginning of the show). The next step was to make sure that all the characters were interesting and had depth.\n\nGranshaw asked if the play having moved to several different locations changed staging and the play itself. Cox told her that it definitely did because, as each theater grew in popularity, it also grew in size and stage space. He and McCarthy, of course, found it challenging to make it bigger and grander but still remain exciting and interesting, therefore using the technique of the different doors.\n\nWhen asked what it was like balancing the humor and serious bits of the show, Cox responded with: \"That was one of the most important things when we were developing the show, that it still had that sense of really true heart to it, just because, similar to what I was saying earlier, that way it doesn\u2019t just feel like a parody, which would have been very easy to do. That way it\u2019s something that sticks with you, that sense of heart. We all come from theater backgrounds, and it was the only way to make it feel like it was an actual story in the same way the books and movies are. The reason they\u2019ve lasted this long because there\u2019s so many relatable things and putting that in and having there be a reason this story is being told.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/interview-playwright-matt-cox-on-the-magic-behind-off-broadway-play-puffs|title=Inside Puffs, an unofficial off-Broadway play about Harry Potter's loser kids|first=Lisa|last=Granshaw|date=September 7, 2017|website=SYFY WIRE}}</ref>\n\n== Productions ==\nPuffs opened on December 3, 2015 at the [[off-off-Broadway]] theater, [[Peoples Improv Theater|The People's Improv Theater]] in New York City, New York,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thepit-nyc.com/|title=Peoples Improv Theater &#124; Improv Your Life|website=Peoples Improv Theater}}</ref> directed by Kristin McCarthy Parker and was scheduled to be just a five night run. Co-produced by Stephen Stout and Colin Waitt, the production starred Zac Moon, Langston Belton, Julie Ann Earls, A.J. Ditty, Evan Maltby, Madeleine Bundy, Nick Carlillo, Jessie Cannizzaro, Stephen Stout, Eleanor Phillips, and Andy Miller. The theater saw how well Puffs was doing and decided to extend the run which ended up running for eight months.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.playbill.com/article/off-broadways-puffs-sets-closing-date|title=Off-Broadway\u2019s Puffs Sets Closing Date|first=Dan|last=Meyer|date=June 20, 2019|website=Playbill}}</ref> \n\nIn late 2016, Tilted Windmills Theatricals decided to produce Puffs at the Elektra Theater [[Off-Broadway]]. Costumes were designed by Madeleine Bundy. The set and props were designed by Madeleine Bundy and Liz Blessing, [[Stage lighting|Lighting]] was designed by Michelle Kelleher, [[Sound design|Sound]] was designed Cox himself, and the production included Original Music by Brian Hoes. The cast remained the same except for Maltby, who was replaced by James Fouhey. The production also gained two swings, Jake Keefe and Anna Dart.\n\nAbout a year later, [[New World Stages]], an Off-Broadway theater offered to take Puffs in for a permanent run in stage 5. It opened on July 17, 2017 with same cast, designs, and direction from the Elektra. However, Blessing did drop the production, leaving Bundy in charge of [[Scenic design|scenic]], [[Costume design|costume]], and [[Property designer|property]] designs.\n\nIn late May of 2018, [[Fathom Events]] announced that they would be broadcasting Puffs live in theaters around the world for two nights.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fathomevents.com/events/puffs|title=Puffs: Filmed Live Off Broadway in Movie Theaters|website=Fathom Events}}</ref> The production was later uploaded to BroadwayHD where it still remains. \n\nIn April of 2019, Puffs announced a production at [[The Entertainment Quarter]] in [[Sydney]], [[Australia]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mugglenet.com/2019/04/puffs-has-announced-its-all-australian-cast-for-its-sydney-production/|title=\"Puffs\" Has Announced an All-Australian Cast for Its Sydney Production|work=www.mugglenet.com|date=April 17, 2019}}</ref> Actress playing Leanne, Lauren McKenna would also be resident directing and it was included that the Sydney production would essentially re-create designs by Bundy, Goldman, Cox, and Hoes. It opened May 17 and it was decided to include Saturday and Sunday [[G-rated]] matinees. The production opened on May 17.\n\nOn June 20, Puffs Off-Broadway announced that they would be closing Off-Broadway on August 18 and did subsequently. \n\nThe Canadian premier of Puffs opened on June 7, 2019 at [[The Lower Ossington Theatre]] in [[Toronto]], [[Canada]] directed by Seanna Kennedy, Stage Managed by Alyssa Obrigewitsch, and produced by Joseph Patrick.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tickets.ticketwise.com/event/puffs|title=Tickets for PUFFS Toronto|work=www.ticketwise.com|date=June 7, 2019}}</ref> It featured set design by Michael Nicholas Galloro, costume design by Rachelle Bradley, and lighting design by Mikael Kangas. It closed on August 4th, 2019. \n\nThe show's licensing was released on July 11 through [[Samuel French, Inc.]] (now Concord Theatricals). Four versions of the play were offered: a one act version that was played Off-Broadway (105 mins), a one act jr version (105 mins), a two act version (120 mins), and a two act jr version (145 mins). The non-jr. versions are [[R rating|R-rated]]. The script includes and introduction by Cox, alternate scenes and monologues, and even a glossary of magic words used throughout the play. \n\n== Synopsis ==\n\n=== Prologue ===\nA [[Narration|Narrator]] addresses the audience revealing a story about a [[Harry Potter (character)|young, orphaned boy with a scar in the shape of a lightning bolt]], but quickly dismisses the boy's story. He then introduces another orphan named Wayne who lives with his uncle Dave in [[New Mexico]]. One day, an owl drops a letter in Wayne's living room telling him that he has been invited to \"[[Hogwarts|a certain school of magic and magic]].\" His uncle quickly tells him about how his parents were wizards before rushing him to the train station. Wayne is then taken to the magic school and finds himself in a sorting ceremony. After watching several others being sorted into different houses (\"[[Gryffindor|Braves]],\"\"[[Ravenclaw|Smarts]],\" and \"[[Slytherin|Snakes]]\"), Wayne tells another student waiting how nervous he is to be sorted and ponders if he has enough personality to be sorted. The student is revealed to be the same boy from the beginning (Harry Potter) who is called up and sorted into the Brave house. [[Mcgonnagal]], who is overseeing the sorting, then notices Wayne and calls him up. The hat sorts him in the \"[[Hufflepuff|Puff]]\" category and he is immediately booed by someone. The Narrator reveals that the Puffs were not seen as the smartest or most interesting group in the school which resulted in many disregarding their abilities. He then transports the audience to the Puff common room.\n\n=== Act 1 ===\nThe Puffs, who are all extremely excited to be at the school, go around and introduce themselves. After everyone else, Megan introduces herself declaring that her being put into the Puff house was a mistake and that she should be with the Snakes. Finally, [[Cedric Diggory|Cedric]] shows up and introduces himself as the group leader. He quickly informs the group that they could be laughed at, made fun of, or even cursed but quickly assures them that they are all happy and fun people. He then tells them about the house cup which is awarded to the best house every year and tells them that even though the Puffs have never won, he has hope that they will win or at least get third place. He tells them that in order to win, they have to win points (which are handed out for good behavior). They all go to bed but Megan walks out to go be with the Snakes. Wayne tries to stop her in an effort to avoid losing points but she leaves anyway. Wayne and Oliver bond in the fact that they are both new to the school and magic itself and while Oliver worries about the difficulty of magic, Wayne reassures him. However, after a day of unsuccessful classes and many lost points, Wayne begins to lose hope. The Narrator then takes the audience to the Halloween feast but the festivities are quickly ruined when someone tells the Puffs that there's a troll in the dungeon and they are all forced to go back to their common room. Everyone goes to bed but Wayne and Oliver notice that Megan is missing and go to find her. \n\nMegan is seen wondering around a forbidden chamber and sees a creepy mirror but is reassured when she finds it's only her teacher friend \"A Fat Friar.\" Megan complains about being in the Puffs and missing her mom. The Narrator quickly introduces Megan's mom, Xavia Jones, who is in [[Azkaban|WizPriz]] (wizard prison) for her communication with [[Voldemort|the dark lord]]. Megan finds Wayne and Oliver and quickly assumes that they were spying on her but just when she's about to use and evil spell on them, Wayne recommends that they should all be friends and make the best of being in the Puffs. She agrees and lets them go but before they leave, they all look into the mirror, where they see their greatest desires. Wayne sees that he becomes a hero, Oliver becomes a famous mathematician, and Megan sees her mom escaping and reuniting with her. As they are about to leave, they are caught by [[Professor Sprout|Professor Sproutty]] who scolds them for being in a forbidden area but quickly awards them points when Megan tells them that her friends came to save her from the troll. Sometime later, Cedric runs into Wayne and thanks him for inspiring the Puffs to earn more points. At the end of the year, the headmaster announces that the Puffs came in third place, above the Braves, and they celebrate. The Narrator quickly announces that the headmaster decides to award some questionable points just so that the Braves will win and, by default, the Puffs come in fourth place. At first, they are all heartbroken but Leanne reminds them that \"we're wizards!\" and they celebrate.\n\nThe Narrator introduces the second year where a giant snake attacks the whole school. After another day of disappointing classes, Oliver begins to cry and then yells at another student for taking pictures of him. Later on Halloween, Wayne and Megan run into Oliver telling him that a secret chamber has been opened, there's a monster, and that she's into books. The defense teacher takes matters into his own hands and begins a dueling club. He selects [[Draco Malfoy]] and Potter to duel and when Malfoy casts a snake spell, it is revealed that Harry can talk to snakes. Everyone gets terrified and runs back to the Puff common room. After J Finch worries about dying, Ernie quickly advises him not to leave the room, and Finch agrees but leaves anyway. While he is out in a hallway, he and one of his teachers become frozen due to shock when they see the snake. the trio sneak into the hallway and after Wayne suggests that Megan take Oliver to safety, he plans to kill the monster himself and become the hero of the school. He, however, gets distracted by [[Ginny Weasley|Ginny]]. Later it is revealed that Harry killed the monster and everyone goes home. In year three, Megan reveals that a masked murder is in the school and that she thinks it's her mom who has come to rescue her. She also announces that she is going to hang out with the Braves that year instead of Wayne and Oliver. Leanne invites them to her slumber party and Sally walks in thinking that the boys are throwing it. She takes off her glasses to get a clearer look at the invitation, and the boys quickly find her attractive. After more classes, the Narrator takes the audience to the night of Leanne's sleepover. Cedric arrives and tells them a bedtime story about how the magic school was founded. Before he can get to the part of the story about the Puffs, they are told to go to bed by the headmaster. The trio remains awake and Megan tells them how she feels like a disappointment to her mother. But she feels better after a Puff hug. The headmaster once again arrives to remind them of their field trip the next day where they all get drunk on [[Butterbeer]]. \n\nThe Narrator introduces year four where the school is holding a special [[Tri-Wizard Tournament|three wizard tournament]] with a french school and an intimidating German school. Later, names are drawn from a [[Goblet of fire|fire cup]] to decide who from the magic school will participate alongside the other schools. Cedric's name is drawn but the excitement is quickly halted when Potter's name is drawn as well. Later, Cedric prepares for the tournament by casting spells on different members of the Puffs. Wayne interrupts to give Cedric a book Wayne made featuring all kinds of different creatures Cedric might have to face during the first challenge. The first challenge is held: the student must take the golden egg from a dragon's lair. Cedric uses a spell to turn a rock into a puppy in order to distract the dragon (a spell from Wayne's book) and comes in second place, just behind Potter. A school dance is announced and once Wayne gets a date with Leanne, he suggests that Megan go with Oliver. They awkwardly agree, leave and Cedric approaches Wayne with the golden egg. He tells Wayne that the egg just screams when he tries to open it and Wayne jokingly suggest that he solve it in a bathtub, but Cedric agrees and goes to do so. In the bathroom, he encounters [[Moaning Mrytle|Mrytle]] but he escapes underwater and finally hears the key in the egg: mermaids steal your friends and decides that this will be the second challenge. Later on Christmas, the ball takes place and Megan and Oliver awkwardly attempt to talk. They dance quickly to a slow song and then the scene moves to the second challenge which proves to be quite boring, but Cedric wins so they celebrate anyway. Later, Wayne struggles with a spell and Cedric helps him out while also telling him the struggle of being a Puff but how eventually, failure becomes practice. Cedric promises Wayne that he will teach him all the magic he knows after the third challenge and Wayne excitedly runs off. On the day of the third challenge, the Puffs eagerly stand in the stands and watch Cedric cross through the finish line and run to congratulate him. But before they can, the Narrator announces that it is time for the intermission.\n\n=== Act 2 ===\nThe Narrator begins the act where it left off. Cedric crosses the finish line and they go to see him but they find him laying on the floor and eventually realize that he died. After the headmaster addresses the school, the Narrator brings the audience into year five where all the Puffs are still mourning. They make a promise to not be \"too sad\" but it is quickly broken when a drunk Wayne enters yelling that there is no purpose because they are just Puffs. He runs off angrily and bumps into Potter who has been having troubles with his friends too. Wayne tells him that friends suck and Potter agrees; Wayne finally begins to understand Potter as a person. Meanwhile, some of the Puffs have been inducted into [[Dumbledore's Army|Albus' Army]] and practice their fainting spells, unintentionally fainting each other. The Narrator skips to the end of the year where Megan and Oliver awkwardly try to talk but end up making out in the hallway. Wayne interrupts and breaks up the moment to ask for their forgiveness. However, right as they become friends again, the Puffs tell the audience that the Dark Lord has returned and that nobody is safe. The trio sighs and leave the school for summer break, and the Narrator brings the audience into a dark lair where Mr. Voldy is revealed. Voldy reveals his plans to take over the school and kill everyone. He dismisses everyone but keeps behind one of his [[Dementors|Death Buddies]] who is revealed to be Xavia Jones, freshly escaped from WizPriz. Voldy tells her to go into the school and take Megan away and they run off cackling. The Narrator brings the audience into year six.\n\nThe trio exchange grades they got in their classes and Megan tells Wayne that he has to get a girlfriend before the year is done. Just as he's about to say no, a group of Puffs all run by with dates and Wayne accepts that he needs someone. He vows to his friends that he will be focusing on dates and sports only that year, and not with any magic. Later, Wayne is at the sports tryouts with several other Puffs. After a brief tryout session with the rude department lead, Zach Smith, Sally attempts to flirt with Wayne. Though at first she is unsuccessful, he asks her out and he agrees. Elsewhere, Megan is looking around with a note she thought was written by Oliver. However, Xavia surprises her and leads her hostage to the same corridor with the mirror. Wayne and Sally are quickly seen on their date, where they have just been running around the school. She leans in for a kiss and he kisses her, but she takes him by surprise by [[Sexual intercourse|jumping on top of him]]. He at first questions if they are allowed to do that but she tells him that no one ever thought the Puffs would do anything so there are no rules against it. She even tells him that they didn't get the [[Sex education|special teenage magic talk]] taught by [[Severus Snape|Mr. Snape]]. She then takes him by the arm and drags him off. \n\nThe Narrator brings the audience back to the corridor where Megan and Oliver are found being held hostage. Wayne runs in on them (attempting to hide from Sally) and gets caught to. Xavia once again appears having taken all of their wands, leaving them defenseless. She tells Megan that it's time for her to take Megan out of the school but quickly takes back the statement. She tells Megan that she is nothing but a Puff and that she is a disgrace to her mother. Megan tries to prove her wrong by taking her wand and begins to cast an evil spell on her friends, but she finds that she can't. Xavia, angrily, takes back her wand and begins to say the [[Avada kedavra|death spell]] in front of all three of them. She gets the spell wrong several times and Megan realizes that Xavia is also a Puff. Xavia quickly takes them back in a flashback to prove that the Dark Lord brought her into his evil army but once the flashback is over, she accidentally releases them. Megan finally proves her point and Wayne finally uses his magic to get all the wands from Xavia. She vows that they will regret this and vanishes. The trio celebrates that they beat Xavia but Megan quickly becomes sad realizing that her mother is just a Puff and not what she thought. They comfort her and all find that they're standing in front of the same mirror. But instead of their original wishes, they just find themselves as friends in the mirror. Later, they are all practicing their magic when they see a skull fall from the sky and realize that the headmaster is dead. They hold a short memorial and go home for the summer.\n\nThrough a series of letters, Oliver reveals to his friends that for his own safety, he will not be going back to school for the last year. Once the year begins, Wayne and Megan find that it is very hard to get on without Oliver. But their worries are quickly forgotten when the Puffs announce that Harry has returned to fight the Dark Lord and they all rush to the great hall to meet him. They are soon interrupted by Mr. Voldy over the loud speaker, who tells everyone to bring him Harry or that there will be consequences. Harry runs off to find a tiara and the Puffs debate what to do. They eventually come to the consensus that they can't fix anything because they are \"just Puffs\" so decide to go home. But Leanne steps up for the group telling them once again that \"we're wizards!\" and they all agree to help, even Megan after some encouragement. They all leave to fight against Voldy and his army and all get a moment to show their skills. Just when Megan and Wayne are in trouble, Oliver shows up to help them. Xavia also sneaks in and Megan tells her friends that she wants to fight alone. Xavia finally kills one of the death buddies but immediately feels guilty and accepts that she's a Puff. Megan and her make up, and Xavia gives Megan her wand. Sally, in an attempt to cast a spell, finally puts her glasses back on but is killed anyway. J Finch, in an effort to save Ernie Mac, also dies. Leanne fights multiple death buddies at once but is ultimately killed. The trio sneaks back in and when confronted, are saved by their [[Dobby (Harry Potter)|house elf]]. But when Harry walks by, Voldy kills Wayne thinking it was Harry.\n\nWayne appears in a white train station with the headmaster. They have a conversation where Wayne complains about how his life meant nothing to anyone else and how no one will remember him. The headmaster notes that sometimes, people are the heroes in their own story and in their own way. He then politely asks if Wayne can go so he can meet Harry and Wayne goes, but not before asking what the point of the school was. The Headmaster casts one more spell revealing the flag Wayne was given in the sorting ceremony. He accepts his fate and wonders off into the distance. Harry appears and gives the headmaster a hug before the stage goes dark. The Narrator walks out once again concluding the story, but he tells the audience that in some way, they are all puffs. Before he leaves, he takes the audience to one last location.\n\n=== Epilogue: Nineteen Years Later ===\nA now grown up Megan walks through a train station where she meets with her husband, grown up Oliver. They freak out when they realize that neither of them has their child but they find him. The boy is revealed to be none other than the Narrator, now a twelve year old named Wayne. His parents tell him that while the school may be scary and sometimes dangerous, they tell him that he is named after a fearless fighter and send him off on the train. Oliver asks her what house she thinks he'll be placed in and she replies with \"I have a pretty good idea...\" Wayne Jr. is seen in the sorting ceremony where he sits on the stool and the [[Sorting Hat|hat]] is placed on his head. He looks out to the audience and smiles.\n\n== Casts and Characters ==\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n!<big>'''Character'''</big>\n!<big>Off-Off Broadway (2015)</big>\n\nThe PIT Theater<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.broadwayworld.com/article/The-Peoples-Improv-Theater-to-Present-PUFFS-20151012|title=The Peoples Improv Theater to Present 'PUFFS'|last=Desk|first=BWW News|website=BroadwayWorld.com|language=en|access-date=2020-03-30}}</ref>\n!<big>Off-Broadway (2016)</big>\n\nThe Elektra Theater\n!<big>Off-Broadway (2017)</big>\n\nNew World Stages\n!<big>Entertainment Quarter (2019)</big>\n\nSydney, Australia<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.broadwayworld.com/sydney/article/All-Australian-Cast-Announced-For-PUFFS-Sydney-Season-20190416|title=All-Australian Cast Announced For PUFFS Sydney Season|first=BWW News|last=Desk|website=BroadwayWorld.com}}</ref>\n!<big>The Lower Ossington Theatre (2019)</big>\n\nToronto, Canada<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://nowtoronto.com/events/puffs-play/|title=Puffs|first=NOW|last=Magazine|website=nowtoronto.com}}</ref>\n\n|-\n|Wayne Hopkins\n! colspan=\"3\" |Zac Moon\n!Ryan Hawke\n!Mark Willett\n|-\n|Oliver Rivers\n! colspan=\"3\" |Langston Belton\n!Adam Marks\n!Scott Labonte\n|-\n|Megan Jones\n! colspan=\"3\" |Julie Ann Earls\n!Angelina Thompson\n!Rae Bernakevitch\n|-\n|Narrator/Wayne Rivers-Jones\n! colspan=\"3\" |A.J.

K. Rowling]] written in the 1990s, following the adventures of a wizard boy named Harry Potter, his friends, and life at the [[Fiction|fictional]] magic school, [[Hogwarts]]. Only in this story, Harry is but merely a side character. This story focuses on the Puffs, a group of students who were there too but were only seen as the unwanted students. But together, the Puffs gather their few strengths in the time of need.{{Infobox Musical|name=Puffs|image_size=|caption=|subtitle=Or: Seven Increasingly Eventful Years At A Certain School Of Magic And Magic|book=Matt Cox|basis=''[[Harry Potter]]''<br> by [[J.

He tells reporter, Lisa Granshaw, that he came up with the idea for Puffs on a subway ride one night home. He thought to himself \"it would've been really terrible to be another student at that particular magic school whenever Harry was there.\" The whole ride home, he thought about that idea and how every year something bad would happen all because of Potter. He then began to piece together some other ideas from 90's pop-culture references and funny movie flaws that could be an entertaining play. As he began to think about it more, he thought about how easy it would be to sell to \"anyone who has never been destined to save the world\" (words from the [[BroadwayHD]] description of the show).\n\n\"Soon after,\" he says, \"we did a reading, which was fun to put together. We kept tweaking it until we moved from the People's Improv Theater to the Elektra and now New World Stages, and it's been a fun time.\" He told Granshaw that the hardest part about creating the show was to cram seven books, movies, and all the humor into a show that actually wouldn't run for five hours (a line said by the narrator in the beginning of the show). The next step was to make sure that all the characters were interesting and had depth.\n\nGranshaw asked if the play having moved to several different locations changed staging and the play itself. Cox told her that it definitely did because, as each theater grew in popularity, it also grew in size and stage space. He and McCarthy, of course, found it challenging to make it bigger and grander but still remain exciting and interesting, therefore using the technique of the different doors.\n\nWhen asked what it was like balancing the humor and serious bits of the show, Cox responded with: \"That was one of the most important things when we were developing the show, that it still had that sense of really true heart to it, just because, similar to what I was saying earlier, that way it doesn\u2019t just feel like a parody, which would have been very easy to do. That way it\u2019s something that sticks with you, that sense of heart. We all come from theater backgrounds, and it was the only way to make it feel like it was an actual story in the same way the books and movies are. The reason they\u2019ve lasted this long because there\u2019s so many relatable things and putting that in and having there be a reason this story is being told.\"<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.syfy.com/syfywire/interview-playwright-matt-cox-on-the-magic-behind-off-broadway-play-puffs|title=Inside Puffs, an unofficial off-Broadway play about Harry Potter's loser kids|first=Lisa|last=Granshaw|date=September 7, 2017|website=SYFY WIRE}}</ref>\n\n== Productions ==\nPuffs opened on December 3, 2015 at the [[off-off-Broadway]] theater, [[Peoples Improv Theater|The People's Improv Theater]] in New York City, New York,<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://thepit-nyc.com/|title=Peoples Improv Theater &#124; Improv Your Life|website=Peoples Improv Theater}}</ref> directed by Kristin McCarthy Parker and was scheduled to be just a five night run. Co-produced by Stephen Stout and Colin Waitt, the production starred Zac Moon, Langston Belton, Julie Ann Earls, A.J. Ditty, Evan Maltby, Madeleine Bundy, Nick Carlillo, Jessie Cannizzaro, Stephen Stout, Eleanor Phillips, and Andy Miller. The theater saw how well Puffs was doing and decided to extend the run which ended up running for eight months.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.playbill.com/article/off-broadways-puffs-sets-closing-date|title=Off-Broadway\u2019s Puffs Sets Closing Date|first=Dan|last=Meyer|date=June 20, 2019|website=Playbill}}</ref> \n\nIn late 2016, Tilted Windmills Theatricals decided to produce Puffs at the Elektra Theater [[Off-Broadway]]. Costumes were designed by Madeleine Bundy. The set and props were designed by Madeleine Bundy and Liz Blessing, [[Stage lighting|Lighting]] was designed by Michelle Kelleher, [[Sound design|Sound]] was designed Cox himself, and the production included Original Music by Brian Hoes. The cast remained the same except for Maltby, who was replaced by James Fouhey. The production also gained two swings, Jake Keefe and Anna Dart.\n\nAbout a year later, [[New World Stages]], an Off-Broadway theater offered to take Puffs in for a permanent run in stage 5. It opened on July 17, 2017 with same cast, designs, and direction from the Elektra. However, Blessing did drop the production, leaving Bundy in charge of [[Scenic design|scenic]], [[Costume design|costume]], and [[Property designer|property]] designs.\n\nIn late May of 2018, [[Fathom Events]] announced that they would be broadcasting Puffs live in theaters around the world for two nights.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.fathomevents.com/events/puffs|title=Puffs: Filmed Live Off Broadway in Movie Theaters|website=Fathom Events}}</ref> The production was later uploaded to BroadwayHD where it still remains. \n\nIn April of 2019, Puffs announced a production at [[The Entertainment Quarter]] in [[Sydney]], [[Australia]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.mugglenet.com/2019/04/puffs-has-announced-its-all-australian-cast-for-its-sydney-production/|title=\"Puffs\" Has Announced an All-Australian Cast for Its Sydney Production|work=www.mugglenet.com|date=April 17, 2019}}</ref> Actress playing Leanne, Lauren McKenna would also be resident directing and it was included that the Sydney production would essentially re-create designs by Bundy, Goldman, Cox, and Hoes. It opened May 17 and it was decided to include Saturday and Sunday [[G-rated]] matinees. The production opened on May 17.\n\nOn June 20, Puffs Off-Broadway announced that they would be closing Off-Broadway on August 18 and did subsequently. \n\nThe Canadian premier of Puffs opened on June 7th, 2019 at [[The Lower Ossington Theatre]] in [[Toronto]], [[Canada]] directed by Seanna Kennedy, Stage Managed by Alyssa Obrigewitsch, and produced by Joseph Patrick.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://tickets.ticketwise.com/event/puffs|title=Tickets for PUFFS Toronto|work=www.ticketwise.com|date=June 7th, 2019}}</ref> It featured set design by Michael Nicholas Galloro, costume design by Rachelle Bradley, and lighting design by Mikael Kangas. It closed on August 4th, 2019. \n\nThe show's licensing was released on July 11 through [[Samuel French, Inc.]] (now Concord Theatricals). Four versions of the play were offered: a one act version that was played Off-Broadway (105 mins), a one act jr version (105 mins), a two act version (120 mins), and a two act jr version (145 mins). The non-jr. versions are [[R rating|R-rated]]. The script includes and introduction by Cox, alternate scenes and monologues, and even a glossary of magic words used throughout the play. \n\n== Synopsis ==\n\n=== Prologue ===\nA [[Narration|Narrator]] addresses the audience revealing a story about a [[Harry Potter (character)|young, orphaned boy with a scar in the shape of a lightning bolt]], but quickly dismisses the boy's story. He then introduces another orphan named Wayne who lives with his uncle Dave in [[New Mexico]]. One day, an owl drops a letter in Wayne's living room telling him that he has been invited to \"[[Hogwarts|a certain school of magic and magic]].\" His uncle quickly tells him about how his parents were wizards before rushing him to the train station. Wayne is then taken to the magic school and finds himself in a sorting ceremony. After watching several others being sorted into different houses (\"[[Gryffindor|Braves]],\"\"[[Ravenclaw|Smarts]],\" and \"[[Slytherin|Snakes]]\"), Wayne tells another student waiting how nervous he is to be sorted and ponders if he has enough personality to be sorted. The student is revealed to be the same boy from the beginning (Harry Potter) who is called up and sorted into the Brave house. [[Mcgonnagal]], who is overseeing the sorting, then notices Wayne and calls him up. The hat sorts him in the \"[[Hufflepuff|Puff]]\" category and he is immediately booed by someone. The Narrator reveals that the Puffs were not seen as the smartest or most interesting group in the school which resulted in many disregarding their abilities. He then transports the audience to the Puff common room.\n\n=== Act 1 ===\nThe Puffs, who are all extremely excited to be at the school, go around and introduce themselves. After everyone else, Megan introduces herself declaring that her being put into the Puff house was a mistake and that she should be with the Snakes. Finally, [[Cedric Diggory|Cedric]] shows up and introduces himself as the group leader. He quickly informs the group that they could be laughed at, made fun of, or even cursed but quickly assures them that they are all happy and fun people. He then tells them about the house cup which is awarded to the best house every year and tells them that even though the Puffs have never won, he has hope that they will win or at least get third place. He tells them that in order to win, they have to win points (which are handed out for good behavior). They all go to bed but Megan walks out to go be with the Snakes. Wayne tries to stop her in an effort to avoid losing points but she leaves anyway. Wayne and Oliver bond in the fact that they are both new to the school and magic itself and while Oliver worries about the difficulty of magic, Wayne reassures him. However, after a day of unsuccessful classes and many lost points, Wayne begins to lose hope. The Narrator then takes the audience to the Halloween feast but the festivities are quickly ruined when someone tells the Puffs that there's a troll in the dungeon and they are all forced to go back to their common room. Everyone goes to bed but Wayne and Oliver notice that Megan is missing and go to find her. \n\nMegan is seen wondering around a forbidden chamber and sees a creepy mirror but is reassured when she finds it's only her teacher friend \"A Fat Friar.\" Megan complains about being in the Puffs and missing her mom. The Narrator quickly introduces Megan's mom, Xavia Jones, who is in [[Azkaban|WizPriz]] (wizard prison) for her communication with [[Voldemort|the dark lord]]. Megan finds Wayne and Oliver and quickly assumes that they were spying on her but just when she's about to use and evil spell on them, Wayne recommends that they should all be friends and make the best of being in the Puffs. She agrees and lets them go but before they leave, they all look into the mirror, where they see their greatest desires. Wayne sees that he becomes a hero, Oliver becomes a famous mathematician, and Megan sees her mom escaping and reuniting with her. As they are about to leave, they are caught by [[Professor Sprout|Professor Sproutty]] who scolds them for being in a forbidden area but quickly awards them points when Megan tells them that her friends came to save her from the troll. Sometime later, Cedric runs into Wayne and thanks him for inspiring the Puffs to earn more points. At the end of the year, the headmaster announces that the Puffs came in third place, above the Braves, and they celebrate. The Narrator quickly announces that the headmaster decides to award some questionable points just so that the Braves will win and, by default, the Puffs come in fourth place. At first, they are all heartbroken but Leanne reminds them that \"we're wizards!\" and they celebrate.\n\nThe Narrator introduces the second year where a giant snake attacks the whole school. After another day of disappointing classes, Oliver begins to cry and then yells at another student for taking pictures of him. Later on Halloween, Wayne and Megan run into Oliver telling him that a secret chamber has been opened, there's a monster, and that she's into books. The defense teacher takes matters into his own hands and begins a dueling club. He selects [[Draco Malfoy]] and Potter to duel and when Malfoy casts a snake spell, it is revealed that Harry can talk to snakes. Everyone gets terrified and runs back to the Puff common room. After J Finch worries about dying, Ernie quickly advises him not to leave the room, and Finch agrees but leaves anyway. While he is out in a hallway, he and one of his teachers become frozen due to shock when they see the snake. the trio sneak into the hallway and after Wayne suggests that Megan take Oliver to safety, he plans to kill the monster himself and become the hero of the school. He, however, gets distracted by [[Ginny Weasley|Ginny]]. Later it is revealed that Harry killed the monster and everyone goes home. In year three, Megan reveals that a masked murder is in the school and that she thinks it's her mom who has come to rescue her. She also announces that she is going to hang out with the Braves that year instead of Wayne and Oliver. Leanne invites them to her slumber party and Sally walks in thinking that the boys are throwing it. She takes off her glasses to get a clearer look at the invitation, and the boys quickly find her attractive. After more classes, the Narrator takes the audience to the night of Leanne's sleepover. Cedric arrives and tells them a bedtime story about how the magic school was founded. Before he can get to the part of the story about the Puffs, they are told to go to bed by the headmaster. The trio remains awake and Megan tells them how she feels like a disappointment to her mother. But she feels better after a Puff hug. The headmaster once again arrives to remind them of their field trip the next day where they all get drunk on [[Butterbeer]]. \n\nThe Narrator introduces year four where the school is holding a special [[Tri-Wizard Tournament|three wizard tournament]] with a french school and an intimidating German school. Later, names are drawn from a [[Goblet of fire|fire cup]] to decide who from the magic school will participate alongside the other schools. Cedric's name is drawn but the excitement is quickly halted when Potter's name is drawn as well. Later, Cedric prepares for the tournament by casting spells on different members of the Puffs. Wayne interrupts to give Cedric a book Wayne made featuring all kinds of different creatures Cedric might have to face during the first challenge. The first challenge is held: the student must take the golden egg from a dragon's lair. Cedric uses a spell to turn a rock into a puppy in order to distract the dragon (a spell from Wayne's book) and comes in second place, just behind Potter. A school dance is announced and once Wayne gets a date with Leanne, he suggests that Megan go with Oliver. They awkwardly agree, leave and Cedric approaches Wayne with the golden egg. He tells Wayne that the egg just screams when he tries to open it and Wayne jokingly suggest that he solve it in a bathtub, but Cedric agrees and goes to do so. In the bathroom, he encounters [[Moaning Mrytle|Mrytle]] but he escapes underwater and finally hears the key in the egg: mermaids steal your friends and decides that this will be the second challenge. Later on Christmas, the ball takes place and Megan and Oliver awkwardly attempt to talk. They dance quickly to a slow song and then the scene moves to the second challenge which proves to be quite boring, but Cedric wins so they celebrate anyway. Later, Wayne struggles with a spell and Cedric helps him out while also telling him the struggle of being a Puff but how eventually, failure becomes practice. Cedric promises Wayne that he will teach him all the magic he knows after the third challenge and Wayne excitedly runs off. On the day of the third challenge, the Puffs eagerly stand in the stands and watch Cedric cross through the finish line and run to congratulate him. But before they can, the Narrator announces that it is time for the intermission.\n\n=== Act 2 ===\nThe Narrator begins the act where it left off. Cedric crosses the finish line and they go to see him but they find him laying on the floor and eventually realize that he died. After the headmaster addresses the school, the Narrator brings the audience into year five where all the Puffs are still mourning. They make a promise to not be \"too sad\" but it is quickly broken when a drunk Wayne enters yelling that there is no purpose because they are just Puffs. He runs off angrily and bumps into Potter who has been having troubles with his friends too. Wayne tells him that friends suck and Potter agrees; Wayne finally begins to understand Potter as a person. Meanwhile, some of the Puffs have been inducted into [[Dumbledore's Army|Albus' Army]] and practice their fainting spells, unintentionally fainting each other. The Narrator skips to the end of the year where Megan and Oliver awkwardly try to talk but end up making out in the hallway. Wayne interrupts and breaks up the moment to ask for their forgiveness. However, right as they become friends again, the Puffs tell the audience that the Dark Lord has returned and that nobody is safe. The trio sighs and leave the school for summer break, and the Narrator brings the audience into a dark lair where Mr. Voldy is revealed. Voldy reveals his plans to take over the school and kill everyone. He dismisses everyone but keeps behind one of his [[Dementors|Death Buddies]] who is revealed to be Xavia Jones, freshly escaped from WizPriz. Voldy tells her to go into the school and take Megan away and they run off cackling. The Narrator brings the audience into year six.\n\nThe trio exchange grades they got in their classes and Megan tells Wayne that he has to get a girlfriend before the year is done. Just as he's about to say no, a group of Puffs all run by with dates and Wayne accepts that he needs someone. He vows to his friends that he will be focusing on dates and sports only that year, and not with any magic. Later, Wayne is at the sports tryouts with several other Puffs. After a brief tryout session with the rude department lead, Zach Smith, Sally attempts to flirt with Wayne. Though at first she is unsuccessful, he asks her out and he agrees. Elsewhere, Megan is looking around with a note she thought was written by Oliver. However, Xavia surprises her and leads her hostage to the same corridor with the mirror. Wayne and Sally are quickly seen on their date, where they have just been running around the school. She leans in for a kiss and he kisses her, but she takes him by surprise by [[Sexual intercourse|jumping on top of him]]. He at first questions if they are allowed to do that but she tells him that no one ever thought the Puffs would do anything so there are no rules against it. She even tells him that they didn't get the [[Sex education|special teenage magic talk]] taught by [[Severus Snape|Mr. Snape]]. She then takes him by the arm and drags him off. \n\nThe Narrator brings the audience back to the corridor where Megan and Oliver are found being held hostage. Wayne runs in on them (attempting to hide from Sally) and gets caught to. Xavia once again appears having taken all of their wands, leaving them defenseless. She tells Megan that it's time for her to take Megan out of the school but quickly takes back the statement. She tells Megan that she is nothing but a Puff and that she is a disgrace to her mother. Megan tries to prove her wrong by taking her wand and begins to cast an evil spell on her friends, but she finds that she can't. Xavia, angrily, takes back her wand and begins to say the [[Avada kedavra|death spell]] in front of all three of them. She gets the spell wrong several times and Megan realizes that Xavia is also a Puff. Xavia quickly takes them back in a flashback to prove that the Dark Lord brought her into his evil army but once the flashback is over, she accidentally releases them. Megan finally proves her point and Wayne finally uses his magic to get all the wands from Xavia. She vows that they will regret this and vanishes. The trio celebrates that they beat Xavia but Megan quickly becomes sad realizing that her mother is just a Puff and not what she thought. They comfort her and all find that they're standing in front of the same mirror. But instead of their original wishes, they just find themselves as friends in the mirror. Later, they are all practicing their magic when they see a skull fall from the sky and realize that the headmaster is dead. They hold a short memorial and go home for the summer.\n\nThrough a series of letters, Oliver reveals to his friends that for his own safety, he will not be going back to school for the last year. Once the year begins, Wayne and Megan find that it is very hard to get on without Oliver. But their worries are quickly forgotten when the Puffs announce that Harry has returned to fight the Dark Lord and they all rush to the great hall to meet him. They are soon interrupted by Mr. Voldy over the loud speaker, who tells everyone to bring him Harry or that there will be consequences. Harry runs off to find a tiara and the Puffs debate what to do. They eventually come to the consensus that they can't fix anything because they are \"just Puffs\" so decide to go home. But Leanne steps up for the group telling them once again that \"we're wizards!\" and they all agree to help, even Megan after some encouragement. They all leave to fight against Voldy and his army and all get a moment to show their skills. Just when Megan and Wayne are in trouble, Oliver shows up to help them. Xavia also sneaks in and Megan tells her friends that she wants to fight alone. Xavia finally kills one of the death buddies but immediately feels guilty and accepts that she's a Puff. Megan and her make up, and Xavia gives Megan her wand. Sally, in an attempt to cast a spell, finally puts her glasses back on but is killed anyway. J Finch, in an effort to save Ernie Mac, also dies. Leanne fights multiple death buddies at once but is ultimately killed. The trio sneaks back in and when confronted, are saved by their [[Dobby (Harry Potter)|house elf]]. But when Harry walks by, Voldy kills Wayne thinking it was Harry.\n\nWayne appears in a white train station with the headmaster. They have a conversation where Wayne complains about how his life meant nothing to anyone else and how no one will remember him. The headmaster notes that sometimes, people are the heroes in their own story and in their own way. He then politely asks if Wayne can go so he can meet Harry and Wayne goes, but not before asking what the point of the school was. The Headmaster casts one more spell revealing the flag Wayne was given in the sorting ceremony. He accepts his fate and wonders off into the distance. Harry appears and gives the headmaster a hug before the stage goes dark. The Narrator walks out once again concluding the story, but he tells the audience that in some way, they are all puffs. Before he leaves, he takes the audience to one last location.\n\n=== Epilogue: Nineteen Years Later ===\nA now grown up Megan walks through a train station where she meets with her husband, grown up Oliver. They freak out when they realize that neither of them has their child but they find him. The boy is revealed to be none other than the Narrator, now a twelve year old named Wayne. His parents tell him that while the school may be scary and sometimes dangerous, they tell him that he is named after a fearless fighter and send him off on the train. Oliver asks her what house she thinks he'll be placed in and she replies with \"I have a pretty good idea...\" Wayne Jr. is seen in the sorting ceremony where he sits on the stool and the [[Sorting Hat|hat]] is placed on his head.

It is probably Berg's best-known and most frequently performed instrumental piece, in which the composer sought to reconcile [[diatonicism]] and [[dodecaphony]]. Berg composed it on a commission from [[Louis Krasner]], and it became the last work that he completed. Krasner performed the solo part in the premiere at the [[Palau de la M\u00fasica Catalana]], [[Barcelona]] on 19 April 1936, after the composer's death.\n\n== Conception and composition ==\nThe piece stemmed from a commission from the [[violin]]ist [[Louis Krasner]]. When he first received the commission, Berg was working on his opera ''[[Lulu (opera)|Lulu]]'', and he did not begin work on the [[concerto]] for some months. The event that spurred him into writing was the death by polio of 18-year-old [[Manon Gropius]], the daughter of [[Alma Mahler]] (once [[Gustav Mahler]]'s wife) and [[Walter Gropius]]. Berg set ''Lulu'' aside to write the concerto, which he dedicated \"To the memory of an angel\".<ref name=\"Glass\" />\n\nBerg worked on the piece very quickly, completing it within a few months; it is thought that his working on the concerto was largely responsible for his failing to complete ''Lulu'' before his death on 24 December 1935. The violin concerto was the last work that Berg completed.

It is probably Berg's best-known and most frequently performed instrumental piece, in which the composer sought to reconcile [[diatonicism]] and [[dodecaphony]]. Berg composed it on a commission from [[Louis Krasner]], and it became the last work that he completed. Krasner performed the solo part in the premiere at the [[Palau de la M\u00fasica Catalana]], [[Barcelona]] on 19 April 1936, after the composer's death.\n\n== Conception and composition ==\nThe piece stemmed from a commission from the [[violin]]ist [[Louis Krasner]]. When he first received the commission, Berg was working on his opera ''[[Lulu (opera)|Lulu]]'', and he did not begin work on the [[concerto]] for some months. The event that spurred him into writing was the death by polio of 18-year-old [[Manon Gropius]], the daughter of [[Alma Mahler]] (once [[Gustav Mahler]]'s wife) and [[Walter Gropius]]. Berg set ''Lulu'' aside to write the concerto, which he dedicated \"To the memory of an angel\".<ref name=\"Glass\" />\n\nBerg worked on the piece very quickly, completing it within a few months; it is thought that his working on the concerto was largely responsible for his failing to complete ''Lulu'' before his death on 24 December 1935. The violin concerto was the last work that Berg completed. In a letter to Krasner dated 16 July 1935, Berg confessed: {{quote|Yesterday I finished the composition [without the orchestration] of our Violin Concerto.

It is regarded as the most extreme and complete form of [[authoritarianism]]. In totalitarian states, [[political power]] has often been held by [[Autocracy|autocrats]] who employ all-encompassing campaigns  in which [[propaganda]] is broadcast by state-controlled [[mass media]].<ref name=\"reflections2\">{{cite book|first=Robert|last=Conquest|title=Reflections on a Ravaged Century|date=1999|isbn=0-393-04818-7|page=74}}</ref>\n\nTotalitarian regimes are often characterized by extensive [[political repression]], a complete lack of [[democracy]], widespread [[Cult of personality|personality cultism]], [[Command economy|absolute control over the economy]], [[censorship|restrictions on speech]], [[mass surveillance]], and widespread use of [[state terrorism]]. Other aspects of a totalitarian regime include the use of [[concentration camps]], repressive [[secret police]], [[religious persecution]] or [[state atheism]], the extensive practice of [[capital punishment]], [[electoral fraud|fraudulent elections]] (if they take place), and potentially state-sponsored [[mass murder]] and [[genocide]]s. Historian [[Robert Conquest]] describes a totalitarian state as one which recognizes no limit on its authority in any sphere of public or private life and it extends that authority to whatever length is feasible.<ref name=\"reflections2\">{{cite book|first=Robert|last=Conquest|title=Reflections on a Ravaged Century|date=1999|isbn=0-393-04818-7|page=74}}</ref>\n\nThe concept was first developed in the 1920s by both [[Weimar Republic|Weimar]] jurist (and later [[Nazi Germany|Nazi]] academic) [[Carl Schmitt]] and, concurrently, the [[Italian fascism|Italian fascists]]. Italian fascist [[Benito Mussolini]] said \"Everything within the state, nothing outside the state, nothing against the state\".

The latter denotes a state in which the single power holder\u2014an individual \"[[dictator]]\", a committee or a [[Military dictatorship|junta]] or an otherwise small group of political elite\u2014monopolizes political power. \"[The] authoritarian state [...] is only concerned with political power and as long as it is not contested it gives society a certain degree of liberty\".<ref name=\"Cinpoes\">Radu Cinpoes, ''Nationalism and Identity in Romania: A History of Extreme Politics from the Birth of the State to EU Accession'', p. 70.</ref> Authoritarianism \"does not attempt to change the world and human nature\".<ref name=\"Cinpoes\" /> In contrast, a totalitarian regime attempts to control virtually all aspects of the social life, including the economy, education, art, science, private life and morals of citizens. Some totalitarian governments may promote an elaborate ideology: \"The officially proclaimed [[ideology]] penetrates into the deepest reaches of societal structure and the totalitarian government seeks to completely control the thoughts and actions of its citizens\".<ref name=\"regime\" /> It also mobilizes the whole population in pursuit of its goals. [[Carl Joachim Friedrich]] writes that \"a totalist ideology, a party reinforced by a [[secret police]], and monopoly control of [...] industrial mass society\" are the three features of totalitarian regimes that distinguish them from other autocracies.<ref name=\"Cinpoes\" />\n\n== Pre 1945 uses of the term ==\nThe notion that totalitarianism is \"total\" political power which is exercised by the state was formulated in 1923 by [[Giovanni Amendola]], who described [[Italian Fascism]] as a system which was fundamentally different from conventional [[dictatorship]]s.<ref name=\"regime\">* {{citation | author =Richard Pipes | author-link =Richard Pipes | publication-date = | year =1995 | title =Russia Under the Bolshevik Regime | place =New York | publisher =Vintage Books, Random House Inc. | isbn =0394502426 | page =[https://archive.org/details/russiaunderbolsh00rich/page/243 243] | url-access =registration | url =https://archive.org/details/russiaunderbolsh00rich/page/243}}</ref> The term was later assigned a positive meaning in the writings of [[Giovanni Gentile]], Italy's most prominent philosopher and leading theorist of [[fascism]].

In his essay ''[[Why I Write]]'', he wrote: \"The [[Spanish Civil War|Spanish war]] and other events in 1936\u201337 turned the scale and thereafter I knew where I stood. Every line of serious work that I have written since 1936 has been written, directly or indirectly, against totalitarianism and for [[democratic socialism]], as I understand it\".<ref>Orwell, George, [http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks03/0300011h.html#part47 \"Why I Write\"], Gangrel (Summer) 1946.</ref>\n\nDuring a 1945 lecture series entitled ''The Soviet Impact on the Western World'' (published as a book in 1946), the pro-Soviet British historian [[E. H. Carr]] claimed: \"The trend away from individualism and towards totalitarianism is everywhere unmistakable\" and that [[Marxism\u2013Leninism]] was by far the most successful type of totalitarianism as proved by Soviet industrial growth and the [[Red Army]]'s role in defeating Germany. Only the \"blind and incurable\" could ignore the trend towards totalitarianism, said Carr.<ref>Laqueur, Walter, ''The Fate of the Revolution'', New York: Scribner, 1987, p. 131.</ref>\n\nIn ''[[The Open Society and Its Enemies]]'' (1945) and ''[[The Poverty of Historicism]]'' (1961), [[Karl Popper]] articulated an influential critique of totalitarianism: in both works, he contrasted the \"open society\" of [[liberal democracy]] with totalitarianism and argued that the latter is grounded in the belief that history moves toward an immutable future in accordance with knowable laws.\n\n== 1946\u20131987 Scholarly proposals criteria ==\n<!--'Anti-totalitarianism', 'Antitotalitarianism', 'Anti-totalitarian', and 'Anti-totalitarian' redirect here-->\nIn ''[[The Origins of Totalitarianism]]'', [[Hannah Arendt]] argued that [[Nazism|Nazi]] and [[Communism|Communist]] regimes were new forms of government and not merely updated versions of the old [[tyrannies]]. According to Arendt, the source of the mass appeal of totalitarian regimes is their [[ideology]], which provides a comforting, single answer to the mysteries of the past, present and future. For Nazism, all history is the history of [[race struggle]] and for [[Marxism-Leninism]] all history is the history of [[class struggle]]. Once that premise is accepted, all actions of the state can be justified by [[appeal to nature]] or the [[Historicism|law of history]], justifying their establishment of authoritarian state apparatus.<ref>Dana Richard Villa (2000), ''The Cambridge Companion to Hannah Arendt''. Cambridge University Press, pp. 2\u20133. {{ISBN|0-521-64571-9}}</ref>\n\nIn addition to Arendt, many scholars from a variety of academic backgrounds and ideological positions have closely examined totalitarianism. Among the most noted commentators on totalitarianism are [[Raymond Aron]], Lawrence Aronsen, Franz Borkenau, [[Karl Dietrich Bracher]], [[Zbigniew Brzezinski]], [[Robert Conquest]], [[Carl Joachim Friedrich]], [[Eckhard Jesse]], [[Leopold Labedz]], [[Walter Laqueur]], [[Claude Lefort]], [[Juan Linz]], [[Richard L\u00f6wenthal]], Karl Popper, [[Richard Pipes]], [[Leonard Schapiro]] and [[Adam Ulam]]. Each one of these describes totalitarianism in slightly different ways, but they all agree that totalitarianism seeks to mobilize entire populations in support of an official party ideology and is intolerant of activities which are not directed towards the goals of the party, entailing repression or state control of business, labour unions, [[non-profit organizations]], religious organizations, and minor political parties.\n\nThe concept became prominent in [[Western world|Western]] [[anti-communist]] political discourse during the [[Cold War]] era as a tool to convert pre-war [[anti-fascism]] into postwar anti-communism.<ref name=\"defty\">{{cite book|first=Brook|last=Defty|date=2007|title=Britain, America and Anti-Communist Propaganda 1945\u20131953|publisher=The Information Research Department|others=Chapters 2\u20135}}</ref><ref name=\"siegel\">Achim Siegel, ''The totalitarian paradigm after the end of Communism: towards a theoretical reassessment'', 1998, p. 200 \"Concepts of totalitarianism became most widespread at the height of the Cold War.

Friedrich and Brzezinski argue<ref>Friedrich, Carl and Brzezinski, Zbigniew ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'' Harvard University Press, 1956</ref> that a totalitarian system has the following six, mutually supportive, defining characteristics:\n# Elaborate guiding [[ideology]].\n# [[one-party state|Single mass party]], typically led by a [[dictator]].\n# [[state terrorism|System of terror]], using such instruments as violence and [[secret police]].\n# Monopoly on weapons.\n# Monopoly on the [[Mass media|means of communication]].\n# Central direction and control of the economy through [[state planning]].\nIn the book titled ''[[Democracy and Totalitarianism]]'' (1968), French analyst [[Raymond Aron]] has outlined 5 criteria for a regime to be considered as totalitarian:\n* 1) a [[one-party state]] where one party has a monopoly on all political activity.\n* 2) A state ideology upheld by the ruling party that is given status as the only authority.\n* 3) State information monopoly that controls [[mass media]] for distribution of official truth.\n* 4) State controlled economy with major economic entities under the control of the state.\n* 5) Ideological terror that turns economic or professional actions into crimes. Violators are exposed to prosecution and to ideological persecution.\n\nTotalitarian regimes in Germany, Italy and the Soviet Union had initial origins in the chaos that followed in the wake of [[World War I]] and allowed totalitarian movements to seize control of the government while the sophistication of modern weapons and communications enabled them to effectively establish what Friedrich and Brzezinski called a \"totalitarian dictatorship\". Some [[Social science|social scientists]] have criticized Friedrich and Brzezinski's '''anti-totalitarian'''<!-- boldface per WP:R#PLA --> approach, arguing that the Soviet system, both as a political and as a social entity, was in fact better understood in terms of [[interest group]]s, competing elites, or even in [[social class|class]] terms (using the concept of the ''[[nomenklatura]]'' as a vehicle for a [[New class|new ruling class]]).<ref>Laqueur, Walter, ''The Fate of the Revolution: Interpretations of Soviet history from 1917 to the Present'' (New York: Scribner's, 1987) pp. 186\u201389, 233\u201334</ref> These critics pointed to evidence of the widespread dispersion of power, at least in the implementation of policy, among sectoral and regional authorities. For some followers of this [[Pluralism (political theory)|pluralist]] approach, this was evidence of the ability of the regime to adapt to include new demands. However, proponents of the totalitarian model claimed that the failure of the system to survive showed not only its inability to adapt, but the mere formality of supposed popular participation.\n\nThe German historian [[Karl Dietrich Bracher]], whose work is primarily concerned with Nazi Germany, argues that the \"totalitarian typology\" as developed by Friedrich and Brzezinski is an excessively inflexible model and failed to consider the \"revolutionary dynamic\" that Bracher asserts is at the heart of totalitarianism.<ref name=\"Kershaw, Ian page 25\">Kershaw, Ian ''The Nazi Dictatorship: Problems and Perspectives of Interpretation'', London: Arnold; New York p. 25.</ref> Bracher maintains that the essence of totalitarianism is the total claim to control and remake all aspects of society combined with an all-embracing ideology, the value on authoritarian leadership and the pretence of the common identity of state and society, which distinguished the totalitarian \"closed\" understanding of politics from the \"open\" democratic understanding.<ref name=\"Kershaw, Ian page 25\"/> Unlike the Friedrich-Brzezinski definition, Bracher argued that totalitarian regimes did not require a single leader and could function with a [[collective leadership]], which led the American historian [[Walter Laqueur]] to argue that Bracher's definition seemed to fit reality better than the Friedrich-Brzezinski definition.<ref>Walter Laqueur, ''The Fate of the Revolution: Interpretations of Soviet history from 1917 to the Present'', New York: Scribner's, 1987 p. 241</ref>\n\nIn his 1951 book ''[[The True Believer]]'', [[Eric Hoffer]] argues that mass movements like Stalinism, fascism and Nazism had a common trait in picturing Western democracies and their values as [[decadent]], with people \"too soft, too pleasure-loving and too selfish\" to sacrifice for a higher cause, which for them implies an inner moral and biological decay. He further claims that those movements offered the prospect of a glorious future to frustrated people, enabling them to find a refuge from the lack of personal accomplishments in their individual existence. The individual is then assimilated into a compact collective body and \"fact-proof screens from reality\" are established.<ref>Eric Hoffer, ''The True Believer: Thoughts on the Nature of Mass Movements'', Harper Perennial Modern Classics (2002), {{ISBN|0-06-050591-5}}, pp. 61, 163</ref>\n\nPaul Hanebrink has also argued that many European Christians started to fear Communist regimes after the rise of Hitler: \"For many European Christians, Catholic and Protestant alike, the new postwar \u2018culture war\u2019 crystallized as a struggle against communism.

The latter reflected a \"revanchist, military-minded conservative nationalism\".<ref>Paul Buhle and Edward Francis Rice-Maximin (1995), ''William Appleman Williams: The Tragedy of Empire''. Psychology Press, p. 192. {{ISBN|0-34-912056-0}}</ref> More recently, [[Enzo Traverso]] has attacked the creators of the concept of totalitarianism as having invented it to designate the enemies of the West.<ref>Enzo Traverso (2001), ''Le Totalitarisme: Le XXe si\u00e8cle en d\u00e9bat''. Poche. {{ISBN|978-2020378574}}</ref> Thus, calling Stalin totalitarian instead of authoritarian has been asserted to be a high-sounding but specious excuse for Western self-interest, just as surely as the counterclaim\u2014that alleged debunking of the totalitarian concept may just be a high-sounding but specious excuse for Russian self-interest. For [[Domenico Losurdo]], totalitarianism is a polysemic concept with origins in [[Christian theology]], and that applying it to the political sphere requires an operation of abstract schematism which makes use of isolated elements of historical reality to place [[fascist]] regimes and the [[USSR]] in the dock together, serving the [[anti-communism]] of [[Cold War]]-era intellectuals rather than reflecting intellectual research. Other scholars, such as [[F. William Engdahl]], [[Sheldon Wolin]] and [[Slavoj \u017di\u017eek]], have linked totalitarianism to capitalism and liberalism and used concepts, such as [[totalitarian democracy]], [[inverted totalitarianism]] or [[totalitarian capitalism]].\n\nIn the 2010s, Vladimir Tismaneanu, Richard Shorten and Aviezer Tucker argued that totalitarian ideologies can take different forms in different political systems, but all of them focus on utopianism, scientism or political violence.

Ord states that Orwell's writings show that Orwell's concern was genuine, rather than just a throwaway part of the fictional plot of ''1984''; for example, Orwell argues in 1949: \"A ruling class which could guard against (four previously enumerated sources of risk) would remain in power permanently\".<ref>{{cite book |title=[[The Precipice: Existential Risk and the Future of Humanity]]. |author=[[Toby Ord]]| date=2020 |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing Plc |isbn=9781526600196 |chapter=Chapter 5: Future Risks}}</ref> [[Bertrand Russell]] wrote in 1949, \"Modern techniques have made possible a new intensity of governmental control, and this possibility has been exploited very fully in totalitarian states\".<ref>Clarke, R.

Other aspects of a totalitarian regime include the use of [[concentration camps]], repressive [[secret police]], [[religious persecution]] or [[state atheism]], the extensive practice of [[capital punishment]], [[electoral fraud|fraudulent elections]] (if they take place), and potentially state-sponsored [[mass murder]] and [[genocide]]s.

Some totalitarian governments may promote an elaborate ideology: \"The officially proclaimed [[ideology]] penetrates into the deepest reaches of societal structure and the totalitarian government seeks to completely control the thoughts and actions of its citizens\".<ref name=\"regime\" /> It also mobilizes the whole population in pursuit of its goals.

Among the most noted commentators on totalitarianism are [[Raymond Aron]], Lawrence Aronsen, Franz Borkenau, [[Karl Dietrich Bracher]], [[Zbigniew Brzezinski]], [[Robert Conquest]], [[Carl Joachim Friedrich]], [[Eckhard Jesse]], [[Leopold Labedz]], [[Walter Laqueur]], [[Claude Lefort]], [[Juan Linz]], [[Richard L\u00f6wenthal]], Karl Popper, [[Richard Pipes]], [[Leonard Schapiro]] and [[Adam Ulam]]. Each one of these describes totalitarianism in slightly different ways, but they all agree that totalitarianism seeks to mobilize entire populations in support of an official party ideology and is intolerant of activities which are not directed towards the goals of the party, entailing repression or state control of business, labour unions, [[non-profit organizations]], religious organizations, and minor political parties.\n\nThe concept became prominent in [[Western world|Western]] [[anti-communist]] political discourse during the [[Cold War]] era as a tool to convert pre-war [[anti-fascism]] into postwar anti-communism.<ref name=\"defty\">{{cite book|first=Brook|last=Defty|date=2007|title=Britain, America and Anti-Communist Propaganda 1945\u20131953|publisher=The Information Research Department|others=Chapters 2\u20135}}</ref><ref name=\"siegel\">Achim Siegel, ''The totalitarian paradigm after the end of Communism: towards a theoretical reassessment'', 1998, p. 200 \"Concepts of totalitarianism became most widespread at the height of the Cold War.

Friedrich and Brzezinski argue<ref>Friedrich, Carl and Brzezinski, Zbigniew ''Totalitarian Dictatorship and Autocracy'' Harvard University Press, 1956</ref> that a totalitarian system has the following six, mutually supportive, defining characteristics:\n# Elaborate guiding [[ideology]].\n# [[one-party state|Single mass party]], typically led by a [[dictator]].\n# [[state terrorism|System of terror]], using such instruments as violence and [[secret police]].\n# Monopoly on weapons.\n# Monopoly on the [[Mass media|means of communication]].\n# Central direction and control of the economy through [[state planning]].\nIn the book titled ''[[Democracy and Totalitarianism]]'' (1968), French analyst [[Raymond Aron]] has outlined 5 criteria for a regime to be considered as totalitarian:\n* 1) a [[one-party state]] where one party has a monopoly on all political activity.\n* 2) A state ideology upheld by the ruling party that is given status as the only authority.\n* 3) State information monopoly that controls [[mass media]] for distribution of official truth.\n* 4) State controlled economy with major economic entities under the control of the state.\n* 5) Ideological terror that turns economic or professional actions into crimes. Violators are exposed to prosecution and to ideological persecution.\n\nTotalitarian regimes in Germany, Italy and the Soviet Union had initial origins in the chaos that followed in the wake of [[World War I]] and allowed totalitarian movements to seize control of the government while the sophistication of modern weapons and communications enabled them to effectively establish what Friedrich and Brzezinski called a \"totalitarian dictatorship\". Some [[Social science|social scientists]] have criticized Friedrich and Brzezinski's '''anti-totalitarian'''<!-- boldface per WP:R#PLA --> approach, arguing that the Soviet system, both as a political and as a social entity, was in fact better understood in terms of [[interest group]]s, competing elites, or even in [[social class|class]] terms (using the concept of the ''[[nomenklatura]]'' as a vehicle for a [[New class|new ruling class]]).<ref>Laqueur, Walter, ''The Fate of the Revolution: Interpretations of Soviet history from 1917 to the Present'' (New York: Scribner's, 1987) pp. 186\u201389, 233\u201334</ref> These critics pointed to evidence of the widespread dispersion of power, at least in the implementation of policy, among sectoral and regional authorities. For some followers of this [[Pluralism (political theory)|pluralist]] approach, this was evidence of the ability of the regime to adapt to include new demands. However, proponents of the totalitarian model claimed that the failure of the system to survive showed not only its inability to adapt, but the mere formality of supposed popular participation.\n\nThe German historian [[Karl Dietrich Bracher]], whose work is primarily concerned with Nazi Germany, argues that the \"totalitarian typology\" as developed by Friedrich and Brzezinski is an excessively inflexible model and failed to consider the \"revolutionary dynamic\" that Bracher asserts is at the heart of totalitarianism.<ref name=\"Kershaw, Ian page 25\">Kershaw, Ian ''The Nazi Dictatorship: Problems and Perspectives of Interpretation'', London: Arnold; New York p. 25.</ref> Bracher maintains that the essence of totalitarianism is the total claim to control and remake all aspects of society combined with an all-embracing ideology, the value on authoritarian leadership and the pretence of the common identity of state and society, which distinguished the totalitarian \"closed\" understanding of politics from the \"open\" democratic understanding.<ref name=\"Kershaw, Ian page 25\"/> Unlike the Friedrich-Brzezinski definition, Bracher argued that totalitarian regimes did not require a single leader and could function with a [[collective leadership]], which led the American historian [[Walter Laqueur]] to argue that Bracher's definition seemed to fit reality better than the Friedrich-Brzezinski definition.<ref>Walter Laqueur, ''The Fate of the Revolution: Interpretations of Soviet history from 1917 to the Present'', New York: Scribner's, 1987 p. 241</ref>\n\nIn his 1951 book ''[[The True Believer]]'', [[Eric Hoffer]] argues that mass movements like Stalinism, fascism and Nazism had a common trait in picturing Western democracies and their values as [[decadent]], with people \"too soft, too pleasure-loving and too selfish\" to sacrifice for a higher cause, which for them implies an inner moral and biological decay. He further claims that those movements offered the prospect of a glorious future to frustrated people, enabling them to find a refuge from the lack of personal accomplishments in their individual existence. The individual is then assimilated into a compact collective body and \"fact-proof screens from reality\" are established.<ref>Eric Hoffer, ''The True Believer: Thoughts on the Nature of Mass Movements'', Harper Perennial Modern Classics (2002), {{ISBN|0-06-050591-5}}, pp. 61, 163</ref>\n\nPaul Hanebrink has also argued that many European Christians started to fear Communist regimes after the rise of Hitler: \"For many European Christians, Catholic and Protestant alike, the new postwar \u2018culture war\u2019 crystallized as a struggle against communism.

Arch Getty]].<ref name=\"Laqueur, Walter pages 225-227\">Walter Laqueur, ''The Fate of the Revolution: Interpretations of Soviet history from 1917 to the Present'' (New York: Scribner's, 1987) pp. 225\u201327</ref> Though their individual interpretations differ, the revisionists have argued that the Soviet state under [[Joseph Stalin]] was institutionally weak, that the level of terror was much exaggerated and that\u2014to the extent it occurred\u2014it reflected the weaknesses rather than the strengths of the Soviet state.<ref name=\"Laqueur, Walter pages 225-227\"/> Fitzpatrick argued that the Stalin's purges in the Soviet Union provided an increased [[social mobility]] and therefore a chance for a better life.<ref>Laqueur, Walter, ''The Fate of the Revolution: Interpretations of Soviet history from 1917 to the Present'' (New York: Scribner's, 1987) pp. 225, 228</ref><ref>Fitzpatrick, Sheila, ''Everyday Stalinism: Ordinary Life in Extraordinary Times: Soviet Russia in the 1930s'' (New York: Oxford University Press, 1999)</ref>\n\nWriting in 1987, [[Walter Laqueur]] said that the revisionists in the field of Soviet history were guilty of confusing popularity with morality and of making highly embarrassing and not very convincing arguments against the concept of the Soviet Union as a totalitarian state.<ref name=\"Laqueur, Walter p. 228\">Laqueur, Walter ''The Fate of the Revolution: Interpretations of Soviet history from 1917 to the Present'' (New York: Scribner's, 1987) p. 228</ref> Laqueur argued that the revisionists' arguments with regard to Soviet history were highly similar to the arguments made by [[Ernst Nolte]] regarding German history.<ref name=\"Laqueur, Walter p. 228\"/> Laqueur asserted that concepts such as modernization were inadequate tools for explaining Soviet history while totalitarianism was not.<ref>Walter Laqueur, ''The Fate of the Revolution: Interpretations of Soviet history from 1917 to the Present'' (New York: Scribner's, 1987) p. 233.</ref>\n\nLaqueur's argument has been criticized by modern revisionist historians, such as [[Paul Buhle]], who claim that Laqueur wrongly equates Cold-war revisionism with the German revisionism. The latter reflected a \"revanchist, military-minded conservative nationalism\".<ref>Paul Buhle and Edward Francis Rice-Maximin (1995), ''William Appleman Williams: The Tragedy of Empire''. Psychology Press, p. 192. {{ISBN|0-34-912056-0}}</ref> More recently, [[Enzo Traverso]] has attacked the creators of the concept of totalitarianism as having invented it to designate the enemies of the West.<ref>Enzo Traverso (2001), ''Le Totalitarisme: Le XXe si\u00e8cle en d\u00e9bat''. Poche. {{ISBN|978-2020378574}}</ref> Thus, calling Stalin totalitarian instead of authoritarian has been asserted to be a high-sounding but specious excuse for Western self-interest, just as surely as the counterclaim\u2014that alleged debunking of the totalitarian concept may just be a high-sounding but specious excuse for Russian self-interest. For [[Domenico Losurdo]], totalitarianism is a polysemic concept with origins in [[Christian theology]], and that applying it to the political sphere requires an operation of abstract schematism which makes use of isolated elements of historical reality to place [[fascist]] regimes and the [[USSR]] in the dock together, serving the [[anti-communism]] of [[Cold War]]-era intellectuals rather than reflecting intellectual research. Other scholars, such as [[F. William Engdahl]], [[Sheldon Wolin]] and [[Slavoj \u017di\u017eek]], have linked totalitarianism to capitalism and liberalism and used concepts, such as [[totalitarian democracy]], [[inverted totalitarianism]] or [[totalitarian capitalism]].\n\nIn the 2010s, Vladimir Tismaneanu, Richard Shorten and Aviezer Tucker argued that totalitarian ideologies can take different forms in different political systems, but all of them focus on utopianism, scientism or political violence. They think that both Nazism and Soviet Communism emphasised the role of specialisation in modern societies and saw [[polymathy]] as \"a thing of the past\"; both claimed to have statistical scientific support for their claims, which led to a strict \"ethical\" control of culture, psychological violence and persecution of entire groups.<ref>Richard Shorten \"Modernism and Totalitarianism: Rethinking the Intellectual Sources of Nazism and Stalinism, 1945 to the Present\", Palgrave, 2012; Vladimir Tismaneanu, \"The Devil in History: Communism, Fascism, and Some Lessons of the Twentieth Century\", University of California Press, 2012; Aviezer Tucker \"The Legacies of Totalitarianism: A Theoretical Framework\", Cambridge University Press, 2015.</ref> Their arguments have been criticised by other scholars due to their partiality and anachronism. For instance, Juan Francisco Fuentes treats totalitarianism as an \"[[invented tradition]]\" and the use of notion of \"modern [[despotism]]\" as a \"reverse anachronism\". For Fuentes, \"the anachronistic use of totalitarian/totalitarianism involves the will to reshape the past in the image and likeness of the present.\"<ref>Juan Francisco Fuentes, \"How Words reshape the Past: The 'Old, Old Story' of Totalitarianism\", Politics, Religion & Ideology, 2015, p. 15.</ref>\n\n''The Economist'' has described China's developed [[Social Credit System]] to screen and rank its citizens based on their personal behavior as \"totalitarian\".<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/briefing/2016/12/17/china-invents-the-digital-totalitarian-state |title=China invents the digital totalitarian state |last= |date=17 December 2017 |access-date=14 September 2018 |website=}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/china-social-credit-system-punishments-and-rewards-explained-2018-4|title=China has started ranking citizens with a creepy 'social credit' system \u2013 here's what you can do wrong, and the embarrassing, demeaning ways they can punish you|work=Business Insider|access-date=8 June 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dw.com/en/china-experiments-with-sweeping-social-credit-system/a-42030727|title=China experiments with sweeping Social Credit System |date=4 January 2018 |publisher=Deutsche Welle|website=DW.COM|access-date=8 June 2018}}</ref> China's Social Credit System was first announced in 2014 and aims to introduce the idea that \"Keeping trust is glorious and breaking trust is disgraceful\" according to a government document that guided the ideology of the plan.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.businessinsider.com/china-social-credit-system-punishments-and-rewards-explained-2018-4|title=China has started ranking citizens with a creepy 'social credit' system \u2013 here's what you can do wrong, and the embarrassing, demeaning ways they can punish you|first=Alexandra|last=Ma|website=Business Insider|date=30 October 2018|access-date=12 May 2019}}</ref> By 2020, the Social Credit System should be fully operational and mandatory for millions of people across the country.

Ord states that Orwell's writings show that Orwell's concern was genuine, rather than just a throwaway part of the fictional plot of ''1984''; for example, Orwell argues in 1949: \"A ruling class which could guard against (four previously enumerated sources of risk) would remain in power permanently\".<ref>{{cite book |title=[[The Precipice: Existential Risk and the Future of Humanity]]. |author=[[Toby Ord]]| date=2020 |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing Plc |isbn=9781526600196 |chapter=Chapter 5: Future Risks}}</ref> [[Bertrand Russell]] wrote in 1949, \"Modern techniques have made possible a new intensity of governmental control, and this possibility has been exploited very fully in totalitarian states\".<ref>Clarke, R.
