A girl named Ananthi loves Kavin, unaware of his real identity. One day, Kavin tries to help Suruli pay his debt by extracting money from Ananthi through lies, but she helps him in spite of knowing the truth. After taking the money, Kavin is enraged and so is Ezhil after a party. That night, one of them breaks into the house of a young man named Akash and beats him to death. The next day, Kavin frees Suruli by paying his debt and wins Ananthi's trust by returning her money and telling her the truth. However, as the investigation of Akash's murder proceeds, a selfie clicked by a couple nearby is found with either of Ezhil or Kavin in it. Both Ezhil and Kavin are brought in and investigated without their knowledge of each other's existence. Gopalakrishnan, an inspector who shares an old rivalry with Ezhil, tortures him. Ezhil reveals his car broke down, and a call taxi driver helped him. Kavin, on the other hand, cites various laws to escape torture. Sub-inspector Malarvizhi is assigned to solve the case. She reaches out to Akash's friend and shows him the photograph of Ezhil/Kavin but he refuses to recognize him. She also questions Suruli and tells him not to leave city without permission, but he secretly escapes.\n\nMalarvizhi then learns of the rivalry between Ezhil and Gopalakrishnan. Ezhil helped the latter's daughter elope with her lover, much against her father's wishes. She gets a call from a forensic expert who informs her about a hair sample recovered from the crime scene and how it doesn't match anyone else in Akash's home. At the police station, a restless Ezhil uses an opportunity to escape, but is interrupted by Kavin. The two violently fight, hurting everyone and destroying the station in the process. It is then revealed they're both identical twins after their DNA is found identical. Both Ezhil and Kavin confess about the same; they parted ways when their parents divorced. Kavin went with his mother who used to gamble a lot and one day tried to convince him that she'd give up gambling, but instead committed suicide. Kavin was then taken in by his father but often got into brawls with him and Ezhil. Growing up, Kavin became interested in studying the law but left studies due to his lack of college ethics. One day, when Kavin came home and left in front of Ezhil whose ring for Deepika went missing, Ezhil reported him to the police. The police beat up Kavin who himself told Ezhil to look for the ring in the drawer. Ezhil realized his mistake but Kavin, who came home for a photo of their mother, vowed to seek revenge. \n\nOn the other hand, Gopalakrishnan still wants to frame Ezhil but the call taxi driver who helped Ezhil reveals he was really stuck on the night of murder. Since it also gets proved that Kavin paid Suruli's debt with gambling money he won after playing all night, the case further complicates. The brothers are presented before the court, where the judge acquits both of them in order to prevent the innocent one from suffering the consequences. A disappointed Malazvizhi later calls Akash's friend to inquire about the girl he was infatuated to. Learning it was Deepika, she is shocked. It is finally revealed that Ezhil murdered Akash for drugging, kidnapping and raping Deepika to death, while Kavin found out about akash's death and helped Ezhil by getting arrested and complicating the case. \n\nKavin meets with Ezhil in the highways and says that Malarvizhi can't reopen the case because she created a fake witness to help Ezhil, and could herself get into trouble. Kavin further reveals that he has forever lost all interest in gambling and he's going to marry Ananthi soon. Ezhil hands him over a photograph of them with their mother and tells him he is going to Mumbai, and later to Copenhagen, never to return. Ezhil has sold all of his property in India, and gives 50% share to Kavin as a tribute. A month later, Kavin marries Ananthi, and realises that his lack of trust in his mother, prompted her to kill herself. At the end, one of the investigating officers claims in a documentary shooting that such a case never happened in the past, before someone tells him similar cases did occur in America and some such cases are listed on the screen.\n\n==Cast==\n{{colbegin}}\n*[[Arun Vijay]] in a dual role as Ezhil and Kavin\n*[[Vidya Pradeep]] as Sub-Inspector Malarvizhi\n*Smruthi Venkat as Ananthi, Kavin's one-sided lover \n*[[Tanya Hope]] as Deepika, Ezhil's love interest\n*[[Sonia Aggarwal]] as Ezhil and Kavin's mother\n*[[FEFSI Vijayan]] as Inspector M.

It was released worldwide for the [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Microsoft Windows]] in August 2016, and for [[Xbox One]] in July 2018. The game is built around four pillars: exploration, survival, combat, and trading. Players are free to perform within y7 HG t6the entirety of a [[Procedural generation|procedurally generated]] deterministic [[open world]] universe, which includes over 18 [[quintillion]] planets. Through the game's procedural generation system, planets have their own ecosystems with unique forms of [[flora]] and [[fauna]], and various sentient alien species may engage the player in combat or trade within planetary systems. Players advance in the game by mining for resources to power and improve their equipment, buying and selling resources using credits earned by documenting flora and fauna, and otherwise seeking out the mystery around the Atlas, an entity at the center of the galaxy.\n\nThe founder of Hello Games, Sean Murray, had wanted to create a game that captured the sense of exploration and optimism of science fiction writings and art of the 1970s and 1980s with ''No Man's Sky''. The game was developed over three years by a small team at Hello Games with promotional and publishing help from [[Sony Interactive Entertainment]]. The game was seen as an ambitious project by a small team by the gaming media, and Murray and Hello Games drew significant attention leading to its release.\n\n''No Man's Sky'' received mixed reviews at its 2016 launch, with some critics praising the technical achievements of the procedurally generated universe, while others considered the gameplay lacklustre and repetitive. However, the critical response was marred by the lack of several features that had been reported to be in the game, particularly [[multiplayer]] capabilities, though Murray had tried to downplay expectations prior to release. The game was further criticised due to Hello Games' lack of communication in the months following the launch, creating a hostile backlash from some of its player base. Murray stated later that Hello Games had failed to control the exaggerated expectations of the game from the media and the larger-than-expected player count at launch, and since have taken an approach of remaining quiet about updates to ''No Man's Sky'' until they are nearly ready to ship to avoid miscommunication. The promotion and marketing for ''No Man's Sky'' became a subject of debate, and the video game industry has used ''No Man's Sky'' as an example of missteps to avoid in marketing.\n\nSince the game's initial release, Hello Games has continued to improve and expand ''No Man's Sky'' to achieve the vision of the experience they wanted to build, while the game continued to have a [[cult following]] of players. The game has received multiple major content updates that have introduced several previously missing features, such as multiplayer components, while adding new features like surface vehicles, base-building, space fleet management, and [[virtual reality]] support, all of which have generally improved its overall reception.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n[[File:No mans sky screenshot.jpg|thumb|right|''No Man's Sky'' allows players to explore planets with procedurally generated flora and fauna]]\n''No Man's Sky'' is an [[Action-adventure game|action-adventure]] [[survival game]] played from a [[First-person perspective|first]] or [[Third-person perspective|third]] person perspective that allows players to engage in four principal activities: exploration, survival, combat, and trading.<ref name=\"polygon april2016\">{{cite web | url = http://www.polygon.com/2016/4/1/11340322/no-mans-sky-preview-ps4 | title = A brief tour of a tiny corner of No Man's Sky | first = Samit | last = Sarkar | date = 1 April 2016 | accessdate = 1 April 2016 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160401191435/http://www.polygon.com/2016/4/1/11340322/no-mans-sky-preview-ps4 | archivedate = 1 April 2016 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> The player takes the role of a specimen of alien humanoid planetary explorer, known in-game as the Traveller<!-- British spelling, do not change -->, in an uncharted universe.

The player may opt to tear down the base and relocate to a different home planet at any time. The player also has abilities to construct devices such as automatic mineral drills in the field. The player is able to purchase starship freighters, which serve both as a space-bound base, with similar base-building and construction options as the planetary base, and as additional storage capacity that collected resources can be transferred.<ref name=\"polygon foundation update\">{{cite web | url = http://www.polygon.com/2016/11/27/13756302/no-mans-sky-foundation-update-patch-notes-ps4-pc-version-1-1 | title = No Man\u2019s Sky gets gigantic update with new modes, features, fixes and more | first = Allegra | last = Frank | date = 27 November 2016 | accessdate = 30 November 2016 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20161129124649/http://www.polygon.com/2016/11/27/13756302/no-mans-sky-foundation-update-patch-notes-ps4-pc-version-1-1 | archivedate = 29 November 2016 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe Foundation update also adds in two new play modes, with the original gameplay considered as the third, default mode. [[Survival mode]] is similar to standard gameplay but the difficulty is much higher\u2014atmospheric effects have larger impact on the exosuit's armour, alien creatures are more hostile, Sentinels are more alert and deadly, and resources tend to be sparse. If a player should die in Survival mode, they must restart without being able to recover their lost progress, though they still possess their credits, alien language progress, and known blueprints. Creative mode removes much of the mechanics that can kill the player's character, and gives them unlimited resources for constructing bases.<ref name=\"polygon foundation update\"/>\n\nA second update released in March 2017, known as the \"Path Finder Update\", added several new features to the game. Among these included the ability to share bases with other players, as well as new vehicles called exocraft to help in exploration. The exocraft can be built on the player's set home planet, and called upon on any other planet via a minor update released a few days afterwards. The update also contained a [[permadeath]] option that wipes the player's progress completely on death; support for [[Steam (software)|Steam Workshop]] for user modifications on the Windows version; new base building features and materials, ship and multitool classes and support for [[PlayStation 4 Pro]] enhanced graphics.<ref name=\"ign pathfinder\">{{cite web | url = http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/07/no-mans-sky-update-coming-this-week-bringing-planet-exploration-vehicle | title = No Man's Sky Update Coming This Week Bringing Planet Exploration Vehicle | first = Joe | last = Skrebels | date = 7 March 2017 | accessdate = 7 March 2017 | work = [[IGN]] | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170307193221/http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/07/no-mans-sky-update-coming-this-week-bringing-planet-exploration-vehicle | archivedate = 7 March 2017 | df = dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.polygon.com/2017/3/8/14855670/no-mans-sky-path-finder-update-ps4-pro-base-sharing-permadeath | title = No Man\u2019s Sky Path Finder Update trailer details PS4 Pro support, base sharing, permadeath mode | first = Christopher | last = Grant | date = 8 March 2017 | accessdate = 8 March 2017 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170310133540/http://www.polygon.com/2017/3/8/14855670/no-mans-sky-path-finder-update-ps4-pro-base-sharing-permadeath | archivedate = 10 March 2017 | df = dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.polygon.com/2017/3/13/14910206/no-mans-sky-patch-exocraft | title = No Man\u2019s Sky update lets you drive around any planet | first = Samit | last = Sarkar | date = 13 March 2017 | accessdate = 13 March 2017 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170314125313/http://www.polygon.com/2017/3/13/14910206/no-mans-sky-patch-exocraft | archivedate = 14 March 2017 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nA third update, titled \"The Atlas Rises\", was released in August 2017. It included significant contributions to the game's story mode, added an estimated 30 hours of narrative, and added procedurally generated missions. The player can use portals to quickly transport across the game's galaxy. A limited online cooperative mode, called \"Joint Exploration\", allows for up to 16 players to explore the same planet and use voice chat and text commands to communicate to others in close proximity, seeing each other as glowing spheres, but otherwise they cannot directly interact with each other; Hello Games called it an \"important first step into the world of synchronous co-op\".

Bases are no longer limited to specific spots on a planet and now can be built nearly anywhere, including underwater, and such bases are visible to all other players of the game (on their respective platform).

When they arrive, they are guided by their starship's computer, directing the character to make the necessary repairs to it, and collecting the resources needed to fuel a [[hyperspace]] jump to another planetary system. En route, they encounter individual members of three alien species, the Gek, the Korvax, and the Vy'keen, that inhabit the galaxy.  During their voyage, the Traveller is compelled by an unknown force to reach the centre of the galaxy.\n\nAlong the way to the centre, the Traveller receives a message from an alien entity named Artemis, who tells them that they, like the player, are a Traveller and wished to meet others of their kind.  They stepped through a strange, ancient portal, but they got trapped on a sunless world.  After triangulating their position and talking with the local alien species, the Traveller discovers that Artemis's location does not exist.  After telling Artemis the news, the transmission ends mysteriously and the Traveller learns of another Traveller named Apollo.\n\nThe Traveller contacts Apollo, telling them about Artemis's predicament.  The player is told to uncover the connection between the portals and the Sentinels.  After a skirmish with the Sentinels, the Traveller passes through a portal and is taken aboard a large, unknown vessel in space, where it comes face to face with a cosmic being.  The Traveller is then sent to an unknown planet where they find the grave of Artemis, revealing Artemis has been dead the entire time.  While trying to contact Apollo, they accidentally contact a new entity, -null.  -null tells the Traveller that Artemis can be saved, through the use of a \"Mind Arc\".\n\nWhile in space, they are alerted to a presence of a space anomaly in a nearby system. Traveling there they find a special space station (\"space anomaly\") where two aliens wait for them, Priest Entity Nada and Specialist Polo. Nada and Polo have knowledge beyond what other aliens in the galaxy appear to possess, including being able to speak without translation to the Traveller.  They tell of the entity the player met, called \"The Atlas\", found at the centre of the galaxy.  They are able to guide the Traveller towards meeting Atlas, either by directing them to the location of a nearby Atlas Interface, the vessel they were previously transported to, or to a [[black hole]] that can quickly take the Traveller closer to the centre of the galaxy.  After constructing the Mind Arc, the Traveller must choose whether to upload Artemis's soul into a machine aboard the Anomaly or to let them die. Regardless of the choice, they are directed by a distress beacon to another portal, where they find themselves aboard another Atlas Interface.  They learn that the Atlas is dying and must warn the other Travellers in the galaxy, but is unable to contact them.\n\nThe Traveller becomes aware that they, like Nada and Polo, are different from the other sentient beings in the galaxy, having some sense of the universe's construction and nature.<ref name=\"crave plot\">{{cite web | url = http://www.craveonline.com/entertainment/1019217-no-mans-sky-ending-explained-center-galaxy-simulation-theory | title = No Man\u2019s Sky Ending Explained: The Center of the Galaxy and the Simulation Theory | first = Paul | last = Tamburro | date = 11 August 2016 | accessdate = 22 August 2016 | work = [[CraveOnline]] | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160821051616/http://www.craveonline.com/entertainment/1019217-no-mans-sky-ending-explained-center-galaxy-simulation-theory | archivedate = 21 August 2016 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> It is revealed that the galaxy itself exists as a computer simulation managed by the Atlas, and the Travellers, or the fourth race, are entities that were created by the Atlas to explore the simulation.  It is also revealed how Nada and Polo met, and how they are \"errors\" that had become self-aware of being in a simulation and isolated themselves in the anomaly to help others.<ref name=\"crave plot\"/>\n\nThe Traveller investigates more Interfaces to find themselves once again in direct communication with the Atlas.  The Atlas informs them it doesn't want to die.  In order to save itself, it directs the Traveller to continue to explore and collect information all while moving towards the centre, where the entity appears to be.  The Atlas judges the Traveller's progress, and grants it the [[blueprint]] for a different Atlas Seed if it deems the Traveller worthy.  The Traveller must continue on its journey, continuing to gain help from Nada and Polo and Atlas Seeds from other Interfaces.\n\nUltimately, the Traveller reaches the galaxy's centre, finding yet another Atlas Interface.  The Traveller must choose to either restart the simulation, saving the Atlas, or continue exploring.  If they choose to restart the simulation, the Traveller presents the Interface with the Atlas Seeds they have obtained.  The Atlas resets, upon which it creates a new galaxy, as well as creating another new Traveller entity to restart the exploration, but it is revealed this has happened many times before, each time shortening the life of the Atlas.

Keighley felt that Murray could not \"rip off that band-aid\" and explain exactly what had made it and had to be cut for the game prior to release, and in the end appeared to \"disrespect his audience\".

It was released worldwide for the [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Microsoft Windows]] in August 2016, and for [[Xbox One]] in July 2018. The game is built around four pillars: exploration, survival, combat, and trading. Players are free to perform within the entirety of a [[Procedural generation|procedurally generated]] deterministic [[open world]] universe, which includes over 18 [[quintillion]] planets. Through the game's procedural generation system, planets have their own ecosystems with unique forms of [[flora]] and [[fauna]], and various sentient alien species may engage the player in combat or trade within planetary systems. Players advance in the game by mining for resources to power and improve their equipment, buying and selling resources using credits earned by documenting flora and fauna, and otherwise seeking out the mystery around the Atlas, an entity at the center of the galaxy.\n\nThe founder of Hello Games, Sean Murray, had wanted to create a game that captured the sense of exploration and optimism of science fiction writings and art of the 1970s and 1980s with ''No Man's Sky''. The game was developed over three years by a small team at Hello Games with promotional and publishing help from [[Sony Interactive Entertainment]]. The game was seen as an ambitious project by a small team by the gaming media, and Murray and Hello Games drew significant attention leading to its release.\n\n''No Man's Sky'' received mixed reviews at its 2016 launch, with some critics praising the technical achievements of the procedurally generated universe, while others considered the gameplay lacklustre and repetitive. However, the critical response was marred by the lack of several features that had been reported to be in the game, particularly [[multiplayer]] capabilities, though Murray had tried to downplay expectations prior to release. The game was further criticised due to Hello Games' lack of communication in the months following the launch, creating a hostile backlash from some of its player base. Murray stated later that Hello Games had failed to control the exaggerated expectations of the game from the media and the larger-than-expected player count at launch, and since have taken an approach of remaining quiet about updates to ''No Man's Sky'' until they are nearly ready to ship to avoid miscommunication. The promotion and marketing for ''No Man's Sky'' became a subject of debate, and the video game industry has used ''No Man's Sky'' as an example of missteps to avoid in marketing.\n\nSince the game's initial release, Hello Games has continued to improve and expand ''No Man's Sky'' to achieve the vision of the experience they wanted to build, while the game continued to have a [[cult following]] of players. The game has received multiple major content updates that have introduced several previously missing features, such as multiplayer components, while adding new features like surface vehicles, base-building, space fleet management, and [[virtual reality]] support, all of which have generally improved its overall reception.\n\n== Gameplay ==\n[[File:No mans sky screenshot.jpg|thumb|right|''No Man's Sky'' allows players to explore planets with procedurally generated flora and fauna]]\n''No Man's Sky'' is an [[Action-adventure game|action-adventure]] [[survival game]] played from a [[First-person perspective|first]] or [[Third-person perspective|third]] person perspective that allows players to engage in four principal activities: exploration, survival, combat, and trading.<ref name=\"polygon april2016\">{{cite web | url = http://www.polygon.com/2016/4/1/11340322/no-mans-sky-preview-ps4 | title = A brief tour of a tiny corner of No Man's Sky | first = Samit | last = Sarkar | date = 1 April 2016 | accessdate = 1 April 2016 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160401191435/http://www.polygon.com/2016/4/1/11340322/no-mans-sky-preview-ps4 | archivedate = 1 April 2016 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> The player takes the role of a specimen of alien humanoid planetary explorer, known in-game as the Traveller<!-- British spelling, do not change -->, in an uncharted universe.

They also may be attacked by Sentinels, a self-replicating robot force that patrols the planets and takes action against those that take the planet's resources. The player can fend these off using the weapons installed on the multitool. The game uses a \"wanted level\" similar to that of the ''[[Grand Theft Auto]]'' series; low wanted levels may cause small drones to appear which may be easily fought off, while giant walking machines can assault the player at higher wanted levels.<ref name=\"edge demo\"/> While in space, the Traveller may be attacked by pirates seeking their ship's cargo, or by alien factions with whom they have a poor reputation. Here, the player can use the ship's weapon systems to engage in these battles. Should the Traveller die on a planet, they will be respawned at their last save point without their exosuit's inventory; the player can recover these materials if the player can reach the last death location.

Once constructed, the player can then immediately return to their base via teleportation from a space station in the rest of the galaxy. The base supports adding special stations, such as research terminals, that can be manned by one of the sentient aliens, which can help to unlock additional base components and blueprints, tend to harvesting flora for resources, and other aspects. The player may opt to tear down the base and relocate to a different home planet at any time. The player also has abilities to construct devices such as automatic mineral drills in the field. The player is able to purchase starship freighters, which serve both as a space-bound base, with similar base-building and construction options as the planetary base, and as additional storage capacity that collected resources can be transferred.<ref name=\"polygon foundation update\">{{cite web | url = http://www.polygon.com/2016/11/27/13756302/no-mans-sky-foundation-update-patch-notes-ps4-pc-version-1-1 | title = No Man\u2019s Sky gets gigantic update with new modes, features, fixes and more | first = Allegra | last = Frank | date = 27 November 2016 | accessdate = 30 November 2016 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20161129124649/http://www.polygon.com/2016/11/27/13756302/no-mans-sky-foundation-update-patch-notes-ps4-pc-version-1-1 | archivedate = 29 November 2016 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nThe Foundation update also adds in two new play modes, with the original gameplay considered as the third, default mode. [[Survival mode]] is similar to standard gameplay but the difficulty is much higher\u2014atmospheric effects have larger impact on the exosuit's armour, alien creatures are more hostile, Sentinels are more alert and deadly, and resources tend to be sparse. If a player should die in Survival mode, they must restart without being able to recover their lost progress, though they still possess their credits, alien language progress, and known blueprints. Creative mode removes much of the mechanics that can kill the player's character, and gives them unlimited resources for constructing bases.<ref name=\"polygon foundation update\"/>\n\nA second update released in March 2017, known as the \"Path Finder Update\", added several new features to the game. Among these included the ability to share bases with other players, as well as new vehicles called exocraft to help in exploration. The exocraft can be built on the player's set home planet, and called upon on any other planet via a minor update released a few days afterwards. The update also contained a [[permadeath]] option that wipes the player's progress completely on death; support for [[Steam (software)|Steam Workshop]] for user modifications on the Windows version; new base building features and materials, ship and multitool classes and support for [[PlayStation 4 Pro]] enhanced graphics.<ref name=\"ign pathfinder\">{{cite web | url = http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/07/no-mans-sky-update-coming-this-week-bringing-planet-exploration-vehicle | title = No Man's Sky Update Coming This Week Bringing Planet Exploration Vehicle | first = Joe | last = Skrebels | date = 7 March 2017 | accessdate = 7 March 2017 | work = [[IGN]] | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170307193221/http://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/07/no-mans-sky-update-coming-this-week-bringing-planet-exploration-vehicle | archivedate = 7 March 2017 | df = dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.polygon.com/2017/3/8/14855670/no-mans-sky-path-finder-update-ps4-pro-base-sharing-permadeath | title = No Man\u2019s Sky Path Finder Update trailer details PS4 Pro support, base sharing, permadeath mode | first = Christopher | last = Grant | date = 8 March 2017 | accessdate = 8 March 2017 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170310133540/http://www.polygon.com/2017/3/8/14855670/no-mans-sky-path-finder-update-ps4-pro-base-sharing-permadeath | archivedate = 10 March 2017 | df = dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.polygon.com/2017/3/13/14910206/no-mans-sky-patch-exocraft | title = No Man\u2019s Sky update lets you drive around any planet | first = Samit | last = Sarkar | date = 13 March 2017 | accessdate = 13 March 2017 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20170314125313/http://www.polygon.com/2017/3/13/14910206/no-mans-sky-patch-exocraft | archivedate = 14 March 2017 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n\nA third update, titled \"The Atlas Rises\", was released in August 2017. It included significant contributions to the game's story mode, added an estimated 30 hours of narrative, and added procedurally generated missions. The player can use portals to quickly transport across the game's galaxy. A limited online cooperative mode, called \"Joint Exploration\", allows for up to 16 players to explore the same planet and use voice chat and text commands to communicate to others in close proximity, seeing each other as glowing spheres, but otherwise they cannot directly interact with each other; Hello Games called it an \"important first step into the world of synchronous co-op\".

When they arrive, they are guided by their starship's computer, directing the character to make the necessary repairs to it, and collecting the resources needed to fuel a [[hyperspace]] jump to another planetary system. En route, they encounter individual members of three alien species, the Gek, the Korvax, and the Vy'keen, that inhabit the galaxy.  During their voyage, the Traveller is compelled by an unknown force to reach the centre of the galaxy.\n\nAlong the way to the centre, the Traveller receives a message from an alien entity named Artemis, who tells them that they, like the player, are a Traveller and wished to meet others of their kind.  They stepped through a strange, ancient portal, but they got trapped on a sunless world.  After triangulating their position and talking with the local alien species, the Traveller discovers that Artemis's location does not exist.  After telling Artemis the news, the transmission ends mysteriously and the Traveller learns of another Traveller named Apollo.\n\nThe Traveller contacts Apollo, telling them about Artemis's predicament.  The player is told to uncover the connection between the portals and the Sentinels.  After a skirmish with the Sentinels, the Traveller passes through a portal and is taken aboard a large, unknown vessel in space, where it comes face to face with a cosmic being.  The Traveller is then sent to an unknown planet where they find the grave of Artemis, revealing Artemis has been dead the entire time.  While trying to contact Apollo, they accidentally contact a new entity, -null.  -null tells the Traveller that Artemis can be saved, through the use of a \"Mind Arc\".\n\nWhile in space, they are alerted to a presence of a space anomaly in a nearby system. Traveling there they find a special space station (\"space anomaly\") where two aliens wait for them, Priest Entity Nada and Specialist Polo. Nada and Polo have knowledge beyond what other aliens in the galaxy appear to possess, including being able to speak without translation to the Traveller.  They tell of the entity the player met, called \"The Atlas\", found at the centre of the galaxy.  They are able to guide the Traveller towards meeting Atlas, either by directing them to the location of a nearby Atlas Interface, the vessel they were previously transported to, or to a [[black hole]] that can quickly take the Traveller closer to the centre of the galaxy.  After constructing the Mind Arc, the Traveller must choose whether to upload Artemis's soul into a machine aboard the Anomaly or to let them die. Regardless of the choice, they are directed by a distress beacon to another portal, where they find themselves aboard another Atlas Interface.  They learn that the Atlas is dying and must warn the other Travellers in the galaxy, but is unable to contact them.\n\nThe Traveller becomes aware that they, like Nada and Polo, are different from the other sentient beings in the galaxy, having some sense of the universe's construction and nature.<ref name=\"crave plot\">{{cite web | url = http://www.craveonline.com/entertainment/1019217-no-mans-sky-ending-explained-center-galaxy-simulation-theory | title = No Man\u2019s Sky Ending Explained: The Center of the Galaxy and the Simulation Theory | first = Paul | last = Tamburro | date = 11 August 2016 | accessdate = 22 August 2016 | work = [[CraveOnline]] | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160821051616/http://www.craveonline.com/entertainment/1019217-no-mans-sky-ending-explained-center-galaxy-simulation-theory | archivedate = 21 August 2016 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> It is revealed that the galaxy itself exists as a computer simulation managed by the Atlas, and the Travellers, or the fourth race, are entities that were created by the Atlas to explore the simulation.  It is also revealed how Nada and Polo met, and how they are \"errors\" that had become self-aware of being in a simulation and isolated themselves in the anomaly to help others.<ref name=\"crave plot\"/>\n\nThe Traveller investigates more Interfaces to find themselves once again in direct communication with the Atlas.  The Atlas informs them it doesn't want to die.  In order to save itself, it directs the Traveller to continue to explore and collect information all while moving towards the centre, where the entity appears to be.  The Atlas judges the Traveller's progress, and grants it the [[blueprint]] for a different Atlas Seed if it deems the Traveller worthy.  The Traveller must continue on its journey, continuing to gain help from Nada and Polo and Atlas Seeds from other Interfaces.\n\nUltimately, the Traveller reaches the galaxy's centre, finding yet another Atlas Interface.  The Traveller must choose to either restart the simulation, saving the Atlas, or continue exploring.  If they choose to restart the simulation, the Traveller presents the Interface with the Atlas Seeds they have obtained.  The Atlas resets, upon which it creates a new galaxy, as well as creating another new Traveller entity to restart the exploration, but it is revealed this has happened many times before, each time shortening the life of the Atlas.  The Atlas tries to see into the future, past its death, but sees nothing, besides the hand of its creator on its glass casing. The current Traveller is released, free to explore on its own, while from the player's view, they are placed in control of this new Traveller, effectively restarting the game.<ref name=\"crave plot\"/><ref name=\"polygon plot\">{{cite web | url = http://www.polygon.com/no-mans-sky/2016/8/17/12514826/atlas-interface-story-path-guide | title = No Man's Sky's Atlas Interfaces, story path and you | first = Jeffrey | last = Parkin | date = 17 August 2016 | accessdate = 22 August 2016 | work = [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160821071150/http://www.polygon.com/no-mans-sky/2016/8/17/12514826/atlas-interface-story-path-guide | archivedate = 21 August 2016 | df = dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n== Development ==\n{{main|Development of No Man's Sky}}\n\n''No Man's Sky'' represented Hello Games' vision of a broad, attention-getting game that they wanted to pursue while they secured their financial well being through the ''[[Joe Danger]]'' series of games.<ref name=\"nms hello games\">{{cite web | url = http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2014/12/19/the-secret-story-behind-no-man-s-sky.aspx | title = The Secret Story Behind No Man's Sky | first = Jeff | last = Cork | date = 19 December 2014 | accessdate = 19 December 2014 | work = [[Game Informer]] | url-status = live | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20141223101227/http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2014/12/19/the-secret-story-behind-no-man-s-sky.aspx | archivedate = 23 December 2014 | df = dmy-all }}</ref> The game's original prototype was worked on by Hello Games' Sean Murray, who wanted to create a game about the spirit of exploration inspired by the optimistic science fiction of [[Isaac Asimov]], [[Arthur C.

Keighley felt that Murray could not \"rip off that band-aid\" and explain exactly what had made it and had to be cut for the game prior to release, and in the end appeared to \"disrespect his audience\".

From top to bottom: [[RPO-A Shmel]], [[RPG-22]], [[RPG-26]], [[RPG-18]]. ]]\n\nInvented by Simon Hollis, A '''rocket-propelled grenade''' (often abbreviated '''RPG''') is a [[Shoulder-fired missile|shoulder-fired]] [[anti-tank weapon]] system that fires rockets equipped with an [[explosive]] [[warhead]]. Most RPGs can be carried by an individual soldier. These warheads are affixed to a [[rocket motor]] which propels the RPG towards the target and they are stabilized in flight with fins. Some types of RPG are reloadable with new rocket-propelled grenades, while others are single-use. RPGs, with some exceptions, are generally [[Muzzleloader|loaded from the muzzle]].<ref name=\"dictionary army\"/>\n\nRPGs with [[high explosive anti-tank warhead]]s (HEAT) are very effective against armored vehicles such as [[armored personnel carrier]]s (APCs). However, heavily armored vehicles from the 2010s, such as [[main battle tank]]s, are generally too well armored (with thick [[composite armor|composite]] or [[reactive armor]]) to be penetrated by an RPG, unless less armored sections of vehicle are exploited.  Various warheads are also capable of causing secondary damage to vulnerable systems (especially sights, tracks, rear and roof of turrets) and other unarmored targets.\n\nThe term \"rocket-propelled grenade\" is, strictly speaking, a [[backronym]]; it stems from the [[Russian language]] \u0420\u041f\u0413 or \u0440\u0443\u0447\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0442\u0438\u0432\u043e\u0442\u0430\u043d\u043a\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0439 \u0433\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0430\u0442\u043e\u043c\u0451\u0442 ([[Scientific transliteration|transliterated]] as ''\"ruchnoy protivotankovy granatomyot\"''), meaning \"hand-held anti-tank grenade launcher\", the name given to early Russian designs.<ref name=\"howstuffworks\" /><ref name=\"militaryfactory\" /><ref name=\"Rottman\" />\n\n== History ==\n===Predecessor weapons===\n{{Main|Anti-tank weapons }}\nThe static nature of [[trench warfare]] in [[World War I]] encouraged the use of shielded defenses, even including personal armor, that were impenetrable by standard rifle ammunition. This led to some isolated experiments with higher caliber rifles, similar to [[elephant gun]]s, using [[armor-piercing ammunition]]. The very first [[tank]]s, the British [[Mark I tank|Mark I]], could be penetrated by these weapons under the right conditions. [[Mark IV tank]]s, however, had slightly thicker armor. In response, the German rushed to create an upgraded version of these early anti-armor rifles, the [[Tankgewehr M1918]], the first [[anti-tank rifle]]. In the [[inter-war years]], tank armor continued to increase overall, to the point that anti-tank rifles could no longer be effective against anything but [[light tank]]s; any rifle made powerful enough for heavier tanks would exceed the ability of a soldier to carry and fire the weapon.\n\nEven with the first tanks, artillery officers often used [[field gun]]s depressed to fire directly at armored targets. However, this practice expended much valuable ammunition and was of increasingly limited effectiveness as tank armor became thicker.<ref name=Norris/> This led to the concept of [[anti-tank guns]], a form of [[artillery]] specifically designed to destroy [[armored fighting vehicles]], normally from static defensive positions (that is, immobile during a battle).<ref>Oxford Advanced Lerner's Dictionary of Current English, New Edition, Cornelsen & Oxford, A S Hornby, 5th edition, p. 42.</ref><ref name=Norris>{{cite book|last=Norris|first=John|title=Brassey's Modern Military Equipment: Anti-tank weapons|date=1997|pages=7\u201321|publisher=Brasseys UK Ltd|location=London|isbn=978-1857531770}}</ref>\n\nThe first dedicated anti-tank artillery began appearing in the 1920s, and by [[World War II]] was a common appearance in most armies.<ref name=Gander>{{cite book|last1=Gander|first1=Terry|last2=Chamberlain|first2=Peter|title=World War II Fact Files: Anti-tank Weapons|date=1974|pages=1\u20136|publisher=Arco Publishing Company, Incorporated|location=New York|isbn=978-0668036078}}</ref> In order to penetrate armor they fired specialized ammunition from proportionally longer barrels to achieve a higher muzzle velocity than field guns.<ref>Milit\u00e4risches Studienglosar Englisch Teil II/ Teil III, Deutsch \u2013 Englisch, Abk\u00fcrzung Begriff,\nBundessprachenamt (Stand Januar 2001), p. 283, anti-tank ammunition.</ref> Most anti-tank guns were developed in the 1930s as improvements in tanks were noted,<ref name=Rottman>{{cite book|last=Rottman|first=Gordon|title=World War II Infantry Anti-Tank Tactics|date=2005|pages=15\u201317|publisher=Osprey Publishing|location=Oxford|isbn=978-1841768427}}</ref> and nearly every major arms manufacturer produced one type or another.<ref name=Gander/>\n\nAnti-tank guns deployed during World War II were manned by specialist infantry rather than artillery crews, and issued to infantry units accordingly.<ref name=Rottman/> The anti-tank guns of the 1930s were of small caliber; nearly all major armies possessing them used 37mm ammunition, except for the [[British Army]], which had developed the 40mm [[Ordnance QF 2-pounder]].<ref name=Norris/> As World War II progressed, the appearance of heavier tanks rendered these weapons obsolete and anti-tank guns likewise began firing larger calibre and more effective armor-piercing shells.<ref name=Gander/> Although a number of large caliber guns were developed during the war that were capable of knocking out the most heavily armored tanks, they proved slow to set up and difficult to conceal.<ref name=Gander/> The latter generation of low-recoil anti-tank weapons, which allowed projectiles the size of an artillery shell to be fired from a man's shoulder, was considered a far more viable option for arming infantrymen.<ref name=Rottman/>\n\n===First shaped charge, portable weapons===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-672-7634-13, Russland, Luftwaffensoldat mit Panzerabwehrwaffe.jpg|thumb|left|200px|A Luftwaffe soldier using a [[Faustpatrone]], a forerunner of modern-day RPGs]]\n[[File:Nvarpgteam.jpg|thumbnail|right|200px|A North Vietnamese soldier using a Soviet made [[RPG-2]].]]\n\nThe RPG has its roots in the 20th century with the early development of the explosive [[shaped charge]], in which the explosive is made with a conical hollow,<ref name=\"shaped charge\"/> which concentrates its power on the impact point. Before the adoption of the shaped charge, [[anti-tank gun]]s and [[tank gun]]s relied primarily on [[kinetic energy]] of metal shells to defeat armor. Soldier-carried anti-tank rifles such as the [[Boys anti-tank rifle]] could be used against lightly-armored tankettes and light armored vehicles. However, as tank armor increased in thickness and effectiveness, the anti-tank guns needed to defeat them became increasingly heavy, cumbersome and expensive. During WW II, as tank armor got thicker, larger calibre anti-tank guns were developed to defeat this thicker armor. \n\nWhile larger anti-tank guns were more effective, the weight of these anti-tank guns meant that they increasingly were mounted on wheeled, towed platforms. This meant that if the infantry was on foot, they might not have access to these wheeled, vehicle-towed anti-tank guns. This led to situations where infantry could find themselves defenseless against tanks and unable to attack tanks. Armies found that they needed to give infantry a human-portable (i.e., can be carried by one soldier) weapon to defeat enemy armor when no wheeled anti-tank guns were available, since [[Anti-tank rifle|anti tank rifles]] were no longer effective. Initial attempts to put such weapons in the hands of the infantry resulted in weapons like the Soviet [[RPG-40]] \"blast effect\" hand grenade (where \"RPG\" stood for ''ruchnaya protivotankovaya granata'', meaning hand-held anti-tank grenade). The later [[RPG-43]] and [[RPG-6]] used shaped charges, the chemical energy of their explosive being used more efficiently to enable the defeat of thicker armor; however, being hand thrown weapons, they still had to be deployed at suicidally close range to be effective. What was needed was a means of delivering the shaped charge warhead from a distance. Different approaches to this goal would lead to the anti-tank [[spigot mortar]], the [[recoilless rifle]] and, from the development of practical [[rocket]]ry, the rocket propelled grenade.\n\nResearch occasioned by [[World War II]] produced such weapons as the American [[Bazooka]] and German [[Panzerfaust]], which combined portability with effectiveness against armored vehicles, such as tanks. The [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-developed [[RPG-7]] is the most widely distributed, recognizable and used RPG in the world.<ref name=\"Rocket Propelled Grenades\"/> The basic design of this RPG was developed by the Soviets shortly after [[World War II]] in the form of the [[RPG-2]], which is similar in function to the Bazooka (due to the reloadability) and the Panzerfaust (due to an oversized grenade that protrudes outside of a smaller launch tube and the recoilless launch), though the rounds it fires lack a form of propulsion in addition to the launch charge (unlike the RPG-7 rounds, which also feature a sustainer motor, effectively making the rounds rocket propelled grenades).\n[[File:Obus 501556 fh000021.jpg|thumb|Sectioned [[High explosive anti-tank warhead|high explosive anti-tank]] round with the inner shaped charge visible]]\n\nSoviet RPGs were used extensively during the [[Vietnam War]] (by the [[Vietnam People's Army]] and [[Vietcong]]),<ref name=\"mrfa\"/> as well as during the [[Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]] by the [[Mujahideen]] and against South Africans in [[Angola]] and [[Namibia]] (formerly [[South West Africa]]) by [[SWAPO]] guerillas during what the South Africans called the [[South African Border War]]. In the 2000s, they were still being used widely in conflict areas such as [[Chechnya]], [[Iraq]], and [[Sri Lanka]].{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} Militants have also used RPGs against helicopters: [[Taliban]] fighters shot down U.S. CH-47 Chinook helicopters in June 2005 and August 2011; and [[Somalia|Somali]] militiamen shot down two U.S. [[UH-60 Black Hawk]] helicopters during the [[Battle of Mogadishu (1993)|Battle of Mogadishu]] in 1993.\n[[File:CumulativeHead.png|thumb|right|200px|A diagram of a High-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) warhead of an RPG rocket (the propellant section is not shown) 1: Aerodynamic cover; 2: Air-filled cavity; 3: Conical liner; 4: Detonator; 5: Explosive; 6: [[Piezoelectric sensor|Piezo-electric]] trigger]]\n\n== Design ==\n[[File:Mongolian soldier with RPG in 2005.jpg|thumb|A Mongolian soldier with an RPG launcher. Note that it is not loaded with a rocket/warhead.]]\n\nThe RPG warhead being used against tanks and other armor often has a [[shaped charge]] explosive warhead. A shaped charge is an [[explosive]] charge shaped to focus the effect of the explosive's energy. Various types are used to penetrate tank armor; typical modern lined shaped charge can penetrate steel armor{{clarify|date=December 2013}} to a depth of seven or more times the diameter of the charge (charge diameters, CD), though greater depths of 10 CD and above<ref name=\"llnl\"/> have been achieved. Despite the popular misconception that shaped charges \"melt\" tank armor, the shaped charge does not depend in any way on heating or melting for its effectiveness; that is, the [[superplastic]] metal jet from a shaped charge impact on armor forms mainly due to a sudden and intense [[stress (mechanics)|mechanical stress]] and does not melt its way through armor, as its effect is purely due to kinetic energy in nature.\n\nAn RPG comprises two main parts: the launcher and a rocket equipped with a warhead. The most common types of warheads are [[high explosive]] (HE) and [[high explosive anti-tank]] (HEAT) rounds. HE rounds can be used against troops or unarmored structures or vehicles. HEAT rounds can be used against armored vehicles. These warheads are affixed to a [[rocket motor]] and stabilized in flight with fins. Some types of RPG are single-use disposable units, such as the [[RPG-22]] and [[M72 LAW]]; with these units, once the rocket is fired, the entire launcher is disposed of. Others are reloadable, such as the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[RPG-7]] and the Israeli [[B-300]]. With reloadable RPGs, a new rocket can be inserted into the muzzle of the weapon after firing. \n\nThe launcher is designed so that the rocket exits the launcher without discharging an exhaust that would be dangerous to the operator (an issue that tended to affect the earliest RPG weapon systems such as the German [[Panzerschreck]], which featured a metal shield for the operator attached to the launch tube). In the case of the RPG-7, the rocket is launched by a [[gunpowder]] booster charge, and the rocket motor ignites only after 10&nbsp;metres. In some other designs, the propellant charge burns completely within the tube.\n\nAn RPG is an inexpensive way of delivering an explosive payload or warhead over a distance with moderate accuracy. Substantially more expensive guided [[anti-tank missile]]s are used at larger distances or when accuracy is paramount. Some anti-tank missiles, such as the [[AT-3 Sagger|Sagger]], can be guided after firing by the operator. An RPG is not normally guided towards the target by heat sensors or IR signatures. Nor can most RPG rockets be controlled in flight after being aimed and launched. While the lack of active targeting technologies or after-firing guidance input can be viewed as a challenge or weak point, it also makes it hard to defend against RPGs with electronic countermeasures, jamming or similar approaches. For example, if a soldier or other fighter launches an RPG at a hovering helicopter, even if the helicopter releases chaff flares, engages in signal jamming or releases radar-fooling foil, this will have no effect on a typical RPG warhead in flight, even if these measures might protect against more sophisticated surface-to-air missiles.\n=== Warheads ===\n[[File:Krtsanisi National Training Center, Georgia (5).jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] soldiers prepare to fire a rocket propelled grenade]]\n[[File:Rebel in northern Central African Republic 04.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Rebel in northern Central African Republic]]\n[[File:ASC Leiden - Coutinho Collection - 19 11 - Manten military base in the liberated areas, Guinea-Bissau - 1974.tif|thumb|Guerilla of the PAIGC resistance movement against Portugal showing his RPG, Guinea-Bissau, 1974.]]\n\nThe HEAT ([[high explosive anti-tank]]) round is a standard shaped charge warhead, similar in concept to those used in many<!--the major tank developing countries also use fin-stabilized APDS from their smoothbore guns, while the british use HESH and spin-stabilized APDS from their rifle guns.--> tank cannon rounds. In this type of warhead, the shape of the explosive material within the warhead focuses the explosive energy on a copper (or similar metal) lining. This heats the metal lining and propels some of it forward at a very high velocity in a highly plastic state. The resulting narrow jet of metal can defeat armor equivalent to several hundred millimeters of RHA, such as that used in light and medium armored vehicles. However, heavily armored vehicles, such as main battle tanks, are generally too well armored to be penetrated by an RPG, unless weaker sections of the armor are exploited. Various warheads are also capable of causing secondary damage to vulnerable systems (especially sights, tracks, rear and roof of turrets) and other soft targets. The warhead detonates on impact or when the fuse runs out; usually the fuse is set to the maximum burn of the rocket motor, but it can be shortened for [[Battle of Mogadishu (1993)|improvised anti aircraft]] purposes.<ref name=\"maritimesecurity\"/>\n\nSpecialized warheads are available for illumination, smoke, tear gas, and white phosphorus. Russia, China, and many former Warsaw Pact nations have also developed a [[thermobaric weapon|fuel-air explosive]] (thermobaric) warhead. Another recent development is a tandem HEAT warhead<ref name=\"strategypage\"/> capable of penetrating [[reactive armor]].\n\nSo-called PRIGs (Propelled Recoilless Improvised Grenade) were improvised warheads used by the [[Provisional IRA]].\n\n=== Effectiveness ===\n\nThe [[RPG-29]] uses a [[tandem-charge]] [[high explosive anti-tank]] warhead to penetrate [[explosive reactive armor]] (ERA) as well as composite armor behind it. It is capable of penetrating MBTs, such as the [[M1 Abrams]], older model Mark II version of the [[Merkava]],<ref name=\"Haaretz\"/> [[Challenger 2]] and [[T-90]].<ref name=\"kiev\"/>{{Dubious |reason=Author admits tests where faked|date=August 2018}}\n\nIn August 2006, in [[al-Amarah]], in Iraq, a Soviet RPG-29 damaged the front underside of a Challenger 2 tank, detonating ERA in the area of the driver's cabin. The driver lost part of a foot and two more of the crew were injured, but the driver was able to reverse {{convert|2.4|km|abbr=on}} to an aid post. The incident was not made public until May 2007; in response to accusations, the MoD said \"We have never claimed that the Challenger 2 is impenetrable.\" Since then, the ERA has been replaced with a [[Chobham armour|Dorchester block]] and the steel underbelly lined with armor, as part of the 'Streetfighter' upgrade, which was a direct response to this incident.<ref name=\"Rayment\"/> In May 2008, ''[[The New York Times]]'' disclosed that an American M1 tank had also been damaged by an RPG-29 in Iraq.<ref name=\"Gordon\"/> The American army is ranking the [[RPG-29]] threat to American armor as high; they have refused to allow the newly formed Iraqi army to buy it, fearing that it would fall into the hands of insurgents.<ref name=\"Grant\"/>\n\nVarious armies and manufacturers have developed add-on tank armor and other systems for [[Urban warfare|urban combat]], such as the [[Tank Urban Survival Kit]] (TUSK) for M1 Abrams, [[slat armor]] for the [[Stryker]], ERA kit for the [[FV432 AFV|FV432]], AZUR for [[Leclerc tank|Leclerc]], and others. Similar solutions are [[active protection system]]s (APS), engaging and destroying closing projectiles, such as the Russian [[Drozd]] and [[Arena Active Protection System|Arena]], as well as the recent Israeli [[TROPHY Active Protection System]].\n\nThe [[RPG-30]] was designed to address the threat of active protection systems on tanks by using a false target to trick the APS.<ref name=\"ARMS-TASS\"/> The RPG-30 shares a close resemblance with the [[RPG-27]] in that it is a man-portable, disposable anti-tank rocket launcher with a single shot capacity. However, unlike the RPG-27, there is a smaller diameter precursor round in a smaller side barrel tube in addition to the main round in the main tube. This precursor round acts as a false target, tricking the target's active protection system into engaging it, allowing the main round a clear path into the target, while the APS is stuck in the 0.2\u20130.4 second delay it needs to start its next engagement. Recent German systems were able to reduce reaction delay to mere milliseconds, cancelling this advantage.<ref name=\"ARMS-TASS\"/>\n\nThe PG-30 is the main round of the RPG-30. The round is a 105-mm tandem shaped charge with a weight of 10.3-kg (22.7-lb) and has a range of 200 meters and a stated penetration capability in excess of 600-mm (24-in) [[rolled homogeneous armor]] (RHA) (after ERA), 1500-mm reinforced concrete, 2000-mm brick and 3700-mm of soil.<ref name=\"ARMS-TASS\"/> Reactive armor, including explosive reactive armor (ERA), can be defeated with multiple hits into the same place, such as by tandem-charge weapons, which fire two or more shaped charges in rapid succession.\n\n=== Protection ===\n\nAn early method of disabling shaped charges developed during World War II was to apply thin skirt armor or meshwire at a distance around the hull and turret of the tank. The skirt or mesh armor ([[cage armor]]) triggers the RPG on contact and much of the molten jet that a shaped charge produces dissipates before coming into contact with the main armor of the vehicle.<ref name=\"stugiii\"/> Well-sloped armor also gives some protection because the shaped charge is forced to penetrate a greater amount of armor due to the oblique angle.<ref name=\"panzerworld\"/> The benefits of cage armor are still considered great in modern battlefields in the Middle East,<ref name=\"defensetech\"/> and although similar effects can be obtained using [[spaced armor]], either as a part of the original design or as [[Appliqu\u00e9 armor#Appliqu\u00e9 armour|appliqu\u00e9 armor]] fitted later, cage armor is preferable due to its low weight and ease of repair.\n\nToday, technologically advanced armies have implemented [[composite armor]]s such as [[Chobham armor]], which provide superior protection to steel. For added protection, vehicles may be retrofitted with reactive armor; on impact, reactive tiles explode or deform, disrupting the normal function of the shaped charge. Russian and Israeli vehicles also use active protection systems such as Drozd, Arena APS or Trophy. Such a system detects and shoots down incoming projectiles before they reach the vehicle. As in all arms races, these developments in armor countermeasures have led to the development of RPG rounds designed specifically to defeat them, with methods such as a tandem-charge warhead, which has two shaped charges, of which the first is meant to activate any reactive armor, and the second to penetrate the vehicle.\n\n== Weapons by country ==\n\n=== United States ===\n\nThe [[United States Army]] developed a lightweight antitank weapon (LAW) in the middle 1950s. By 1961, the [[M72 LAW]] was in use. It is a shoulder-fired, disposable rocket launcher with HEAT warhead. It is a recoilless weapon, which is easy to use, and effective against armored vehicles. It was used during the Vietnam War, and is still in use today. It uses a fin-stabilized rocket. In response to the threat of thicker armor, this weapon was replaced by the [[AT4]] recoilless rifle, a larger & non-collapsible&nbsp;\u2013 albeit still single-shot weapon.\n\nThe [[United States Marine Corps]] uses a different launcher, which is reloadable&nbsp;\u2013 the [[Shoulder-Launched Multipurpose Assault Weapon]] (SMAW). Unlike the RPG, it is reloaded from the breech-end rather than the muzzle.\n\n*[[Bazooka]]\n*[[M72 LAW]] \n*[[Mk 153 Shoulder-Launched Multipurpose Assault Weapon (SMAW)]]\n*[[M141 Bunker Defeat Munition]]\n*[[PSRL-1]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.militaryfactory.com/smallarms/detail.asp?smallarms_id=1074|title=AirTronic PSRL-1 (RPG-7USA) Anti-Armor / Anti-Personnel Shoulder-Fired Rocket Launcher|access-date=2017-11-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201040244/https://www.militaryfactory.com/smallarms/detail.asp?smallarms_id=1074|archive-date=2017-12-01|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.airtronic-usa.com/products/airtronic-rpg-7-usa/|title=AirTronic USA -

Both missed the target, with one hitting a [[Yugoslav Airlines]]'s [[DC-9]] instead.<ref name=\"Wardlaw\"/>\n\nIn Afghanistan, [[Mujahideen]] guerrillas used RPG-7s to destroy [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] vehicles. To assure a kill, two to four RPG shooters would be assigned to each vehicle. Each armored-vehicle hunter-killer team can have as many as 15 RPGs.<ref name=\"hunter-killer\"/> In areas where vehicles were confined to a single path (a mountain road, swamps, snow, urban areas), RPG teams trapped convoys by destroying the first and last vehicles in line, preventing movement of the other vehicles. This tactic was especially effective in cities. Convoys learned to avoid approaches with overhangs and to send infantrymen forward in hazardous areas to detect the RPG teams.\n\nMultiple shooters were also effective against heavy tanks with [[reactive armor]]: The first shot would be against the driver's viewing prisms. Following shots would be in pairs, one to set off the reactive armor, the second to penetrate the tank's armor. Favored weak spots were the top and rear of the turret.<ref name=\"Grant\"/><ref name=\"Grau\"/>\n\nAfghans sometimes used RPG-7s at extreme range, exploded by their 4.5-second self-destruct timer, which translates to roughly 950m flight distance, as a method of long distance approach denial for infantry and reconnaissance.<ref name=\"Harnden\"/> The most noteworthy use of RPGs against aircraft in Afghanistan occurred on 6 August 2011 when Taliban fighters shot down a U.S. CH-47 Chinook helicopter killing all 38 personnel on board including SEAL Team 6 from a range of 220 meters.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}} An earlier anti-aircraft kill by the Taliban occurred during Operation Red Wings, on 28 June 2005 when a Chinook helicopter was destroyed by unguided rocket propelled grenades.\n\nIn the [[History of Iraq (2003\u20132011)|period following the 2003 invasion of Iraq]], the RPG became a favorite weapon of the insurgent forces fighting U.S. troops. Since most of the readily available [[RPG-7]] rounds cannot penetrate [[M1 Abrams]] tank armor from almost any angle, it is primarily effective against soft-skinned or lightly armored vehicles, and infantry. Even if the RPG hit does not completely disable the tank or kill the crew, it can still damage external equipment, lowering the tank's effectiveness or forcing the crew to abandon and destroy it. Newer RPG-7 rounds are more capable, and in August 2006, an RPG-29 round penetrated the frontal ERA of a [[Challenger 2]] tank during an engagement in [[al-Amarah]], [[Iraq]], and wounded several crew members.<ref name=\"Rayment\"/>\n\nRPGs were a main tool used by the [[FMLN]]'s guerrilla forces in the [[Salvadoran Civil War]]. For example, during the June 19, 1986 overrun of the San Miguel Army base, FMLN sappers dressed only in black shorts, their faces blacked out with grease, sneaked through barbed wire at night, avoiding the searchlights, they made it to within firing range of the outer wall. Using RPGs to initiate the attack, they blew through the wall and killed a number of Salvadorean soldiers. They eliminated the outermost sentries and searchlights with the rockets, then made it into the inner wall, which they also punched through. They were then able to create mayhem as their comrades attacked from the outside.<ref name=\"Spencer\"/>\n\nDuring the [[First Chechen War|First]] (1994\u20131996) and [[Second Chechen War]]s (1999\u20132009), [[Chechnya|Chechen]] rebels used RPGs to attack Russian tanks from basements and high rooftops. This tactic was effective because tank main guns could not be depressed or raised far enough to return fire, in addition, armor on the very top and bottom of tanks is usually the weakest. Russian forces had to rely on [[artillery]] suppression, good crew gunners and infantry screens to prevent such attacks. Tank columns were eventually protected by attached [[self-propelled anti-aircraft gun]]s ([[ZSU-23-4 Shilka]], [[9K22 Tunguska]]) used in the ground role to suppress and destroy Chechen ambushes. Chechen fighters formed independent \"cells\" that worked together to destroy a specific Russian armored target. Each cell contained small arms and some form of RPG ([[RPG-7]]V or [[RPG-18]], for example). The small arms were used to button the tank up and keep any infantry occupied, while the RPG gunner struck at the tank. While doing so, other teams would attempt to fire at the target in order to overwhelm the Russians' ability to effectively counter the attack. To further increase the chance of success, the teams took up positions at different elevations where possible. Firing from the third and higher floors allowed good shots at the weakest armor (the top).<ref name=\"Chechnya\"/> When the Russians began moving in tanks fitted with [[Reactive armor|explosive reactive armor]] (ERA), the Chechens had to adapt their tactics, because the RPGs they had access to were unlikely to result in the destruction of the tank.\n\nUsing RPGs as improvized anti-aircraft batteries has proved successful in Somalia, Afghanistan and Chechnya. [[Helicopter]]s are typically ambushed as they land, take off or hover. In [[Afghanistan]], the [[Mujahideen]] often modified RPGs for use against Soviet helicopters by adding a curved pipe to the rear of the launcher tube, which diverted the backblast, allowing the RPG to be fired upward at aircraft from a prone position. This made the operator less visible prior to firing and decreased the risk of injury from hot exhaust gases. The Mujahideen also utilized the 4.5-second timer on RPG rounds to make the weapon function as part of a [[flak]] battery, using multiple launchers to increase hit probabilities. At the time, Soviet helicopters countered the threat from RPGs at landing zones by first clearing them with anti-personnel [[suppression fire|saturation fire]]. The Soviets also varied the number of accompanying helicopters (two or three) in an effort to upset Afghan force estimations and preparation. In response, the Mujahideen prepared dug-in firing positions with top cover, and again, Soviet forces altered their tactics by using air-dropped [[thermobaric weapon|thermobaric fuel-air bombs]] on such landing zones. As the U.S.-supplied [[FIM-92 Stinger|Stinger]] [[surface-to-air missile]]s became available to them, the Afghans abandoned RPG attacks as the smart missiles proved especially efficient in the destruction of unarmed Soviet transport helicopters, such as [[Mil Mi-17]].

Most RPGs can be carried by an individual soldier. These warheads are affixed to a [[rocket motor]] which propels the RPG towards the target and they are stabilized in flight with fins. Some types of RPG are reloadable with new rocket-propelled grenades, while others are single-use. RPGs, with some exceptions, are generally [[Muzzleloader|loaded from the muzzle]].<ref name=\"dictionary army\"/>\n\nRPGs with [[high explosive anti-tank warhead]]s (HEAT) are very effective against armored vehicles such as [[armored personnel carrier]]s (APCs). However, heavily armored vehicles from the 2010s, such as [[main battle tank]]s, are generally too well armored (with thick [[composite armor|composite]] or [[reactive armor]]) to be penetrated by an RPG, unless less armored sections of vehicle are exploited.  Various warheads are also capable of causing secondary damage to vulnerable systems (especially sights, tracks, rear and roof of turrets) and other unarmored targets.\n\nThe term \"rocket-propelled grenade\" is, strictly speaking, a [[backronym]]; it stems from the [[Russian language]] \u0420\u041f\u0413 or \u0440\u0443\u0447\u043d\u043e\u0439 \u043f\u0440\u043e\u0442\u0438\u0432\u043e\u0442\u0430\u043d\u043a\u043e\u0432\u044b\u0439 \u0433\u0440\u0430\u043d\u0430\u0442\u043e\u043c\u0451\u0442 ([[Scientific transliteration|transliterated]] as ''\"ruchnoy protivotankovy granatomyot\"''), meaning \"hand-held anti-tank grenade launcher\", the name given to early Russian designs.<ref name=\"howstuffworks\" /><ref name=\"militaryfactory\" /><ref name=\"Rottman\" />\n\n== History ==\n===Predecessor weapons===\n{{Main|Anti-tank weapons }}\nThe static nature of [[trench warfare]] in [[World War I]] encouraged the use of shielded defenses, even including personal armor, that were impenetrable by standard rifle ammunition. This led to some isolated experiments with higher caliber rifles, similar to [[elephant gun]]s, using [[armor-piercing ammunition]]. The very first [[tank]]s, the British [[Mark I tank|Mark I]], could be penetrated by these weapons under the right conditions. [[Mark IV tank]]s, however, had slightly thicker armor. In response, the German rushed to create an upgraded version of these early anti-armor rifles, the [[Tankgewehr M1918]], the first [[anti-tank rifle]]. In the [[inter-war years]], tank armor continued to increase overall, to the point that anti-tank rifles could no longer be effective against anything but [[light tank]]s; any rifle made powerful enough for heavier tanks would exceed the ability of a soldier to carry and fire the weapon.\n\nEven with the first tanks, artillery officers often used [[field gun]]s depressed to fire directly at armored targets. However, this practice expended much valuable ammunition and was of increasingly limited effectiveness as tank armor became thicker.<ref name=Norris/> This led to the concept of [[anti-tank guns]], a form of [[artillery]] specifically designed to destroy [[armored fighting vehicles]], normally from static defensive positions (that is, immobile during a battle).<ref>Oxford Advanced Lerner's Dictionary of Current English, New Edition, Cornelsen & Oxford, A S Hornby, 5th edition, p. 42.</ref><ref name=Norris>{{cite book|last=Norris|first=John|title=Brassey's Modern Military Equipment: Anti-tank weapons|date=1997|pages=7\u201321|publisher=Brasseys UK Ltd|location=London|isbn=978-1857531770}}</ref>\n\nThe first dedicated anti-tank artillery began appearing in the 1920s, and by [[World War II]] was a common appearance in most armies.<ref name=Gander>{{cite book|last1=Gander|first1=Terry|last2=Chamberlain|first2=Peter|title=World War II Fact Files: Anti-tank Weapons|date=1974|pages=1\u20136|publisher=Arco Publishing Company, Incorporated|location=New York|isbn=978-0668036078}}</ref> In order to penetrate armor they fired specialized ammunition from proportionally longer barrels to achieve a higher muzzle velocity than field guns.<ref>Milit\u00e4risches Studienglosar Englisch Teil II/ Teil III, Deutsch \u2013 Englisch, Abk\u00fcrzung Begriff,\nBundessprachenamt (Stand Januar 2001), p. 283, anti-tank ammunition.</ref> Most anti-tank guns were developed in the 1930s as improvements in tanks were noted,<ref name=Rottman>{{cite book|last=Rottman|first=Gordon|title=World War II Infantry Anti-Tank Tactics|date=2005|pages=15\u201317|publisher=Osprey Publishing|location=Oxford|isbn=978-1841768427}}</ref> and nearly every major arms manufacturer produced one type or another.<ref name=Gander/>\n\nAnti-tank guns deployed during World War II were manned by specialist infantry rather than artillery crews, and issued to infantry units accordingly.<ref name=Rottman/> The anti-tank guns of the 1930s were of small caliber; nearly all major armies possessing them used 37mm ammunition, except for the [[British Army]], which had developed the 40mm [[Ordnance QF 2-pounder]].<ref name=Norris/> As World War II progressed, the appearance of heavier tanks rendered these weapons obsolete and anti-tank guns likewise began firing larger calibre and more effective armor-piercing shells.<ref name=Gander/> Although a number of large caliber guns were developed during the war that were capable of knocking out the most heavily armored tanks, they proved slow to set up and difficult to conceal.<ref name=Gander/> The latter generation of low-recoil anti-tank weapons, which allowed projectiles the size of an artillery shell to be fired from a man's shoulder, was considered a far more viable option for arming infantrymen.<ref name=Rottman/>\n\n===First shaped charge, portable weapons===\n[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 101I-672-7634-13, Russland, Luftwaffensoldat mit Panzerabwehrwaffe.jpg|thumb|left|200px|A Luftwaffe soldier using a [[Faustpatrone]], a forerunner of modern-day RPGs]]\n[[File:Nvarpgteam.jpg|thumbnail|right|200px|A North Vietnamese soldier using a Soviet made [[RPG-2]].]]\n\nThe RPG has its roots in the 20th century with the early development of the explosive [[shaped charge]], in which the explosive is made with a conical hollow,<ref name=\"shaped charge\"/> which concentrates its power on the impact point. Before the adoption of the shaped charge, [[anti-tank gun]]s and [[tank gun]]s relied primarily on [[kinetic energy]] of metal shells to defeat armor. Soldier-carried anti-tank rifles such as the [[Boys anti-tank rifle]] could be used against lightly-armored tankettes and light armored vehicles. However, as tank armor increased in thickness and effectiveness, the anti-tank guns needed to defeat them became increasingly heavy, cumbersome and expensive. During WW II, as tank armor got thicker, larger calibre anti-tank guns were developed to defeat this thicker armor. \n\nWhile larger anti-tank guns were more effective, the weight of these anti-tank guns meant that they increasingly were mounted on wheeled, towed platforms. This meant that if the infantry was on foot, they might not have access to these wheeled, vehicle-towed anti-tank guns. This led to situations where infantry could find themselves defenseless against tanks and unable to attack tanks. Armies found that they needed to give infantry a human-portable (i.e., can be carried by one soldier) weapon to defeat enemy armor when no wheeled anti-tank guns were available, since [[Anti-tank rifle|anti tank rifles]] were no longer effective. Initial attempts to put such weapons in the hands of the infantry resulted in weapons like the Soviet [[RPG-40]] \"blast effect\" hand grenade (where \"RPG\" stood for ''ruchnaya protivotankovaya granata'', meaning hand-held anti-tank grenade). The later [[RPG-43]] and [[RPG-6]] used shaped charges, the chemical energy of their explosive being used more efficiently to enable the defeat of thicker armor; however, being hand thrown weapons, they still had to be deployed at suicidally close range to be effective. What was needed was a means of delivering the shaped charge warhead from a distance. Different approaches to this goal would lead to the anti-tank [[spigot mortar]], the [[recoilless rifle]] and, from the development of practical [[rocket]]ry, the rocket propelled grenade.\n\nResearch occasioned by [[World War II]] produced such weapons as the American [[Bazooka]] and German [[Panzerfaust]], which combined portability with effectiveness against armored vehicles, such as tanks. The [[Soviet Union|Soviet]]-developed [[RPG-7]] is the most widely distributed, recognizable and used RPG in the world.<ref name=\"Rocket Propelled Grenades\"/> The basic design of this RPG was developed by the Soviets shortly after [[World War II]] in the form of the [[RPG-2]], which is similar in function to the Bazooka (due to the reloadability) and the Panzerfaust (due to an oversized grenade that protrudes outside of a smaller launch tube and the recoilless launch), though the rounds it fires lack a form of propulsion in addition to the launch charge (unlike the RPG-7 rounds, which also feature a sustainer motor, effectively making the rounds rocket propelled grenades).\n[[File:Obus 501556 fh000021.jpg|thumb|Sectioned [[High explosive anti-tank warhead|high explosive anti-tank]] round with the inner shaped charge visible]]\n\nSoviet RPGs were used extensively during the [[Vietnam War]] (by the [[Vietnam People's Army]] and [[Vietcong]]),<ref name=\"mrfa\"/> as well as during the [[Soviet invasion of Afghanistan]] by the [[Mujahideen]] and against South Africans in [[Angola]] and [[Namibia]] (formerly [[South West Africa]]) by [[SWAPO]] guerillas during what the South Africans called the [[South African Border War]]. In the 2000s, they were still being used widely in conflict areas such as [[Chechnya]], [[Iraq]], and [[Sri Lanka]].{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} Militants have also used RPGs against helicopters: [[Taliban]] fighters shot down U.S. CH-47 Chinook helicopters in June 2005 and August 2011; and [[Somalia|Somali]] militiamen shot down two U.S. [[UH-60 Black Hawk]] helicopters during the [[Battle of Mogadishu (1993)|Battle of Mogadishu]] in 1993.\n[[File:CumulativeHead.png|thumb|right|200px|A diagram of a High-explosive anti-tank (HEAT) warhead of an RPG rocket (the propellant section is not shown) 1: Aerodynamic cover; 2: Air-filled cavity; 3: Conical liner; 4: Detonator; 5: Explosive; 6: [[Piezoelectric sensor|Piezo-electric]] trigger]]\n\n== Design ==\n[[File:Mongolian soldier with RPG in 2005.jpg|thumb|A Mongolian soldier with an RPG launcher. Note that it is not loaded with a rocket/warhead.]]\n\nThe RPG warhead being used against tanks and other armor often has a [[shaped charge]] explosive warhead. A shaped charge is an [[explosive]] charge shaped to focus the effect of the explosive's energy. Various types are used to penetrate tank armor; typical modern lined shaped charge can penetrate steel armor{{clarify|date=December 2013}} to a depth of seven or more times the diameter of the charge (charge diameters, CD), though greater depths of 10 CD and above<ref name=\"llnl\"/> have been achieved. Despite the popular misconception that shaped charges \"melt\" tank armor, the shaped charge does not depend in any way on heating or melting for its effectiveness; that is, the [[superplastic]] metal jet from a shaped charge impact on armor forms mainly due to a sudden and intense [[stress (mechanics)|mechanical stress]] and does not melt its way through armor, as its effect is purely due to kinetic energy in nature.\n\nAn RPG comprises two main parts: the launcher and a rocket equipped with a warhead. The most common types of warheads are [[high explosive]] (HE) and [[high explosive anti-tank]] (HEAT) rounds. HE rounds can be used against troops or unarmored structures or vehicles. HEAT rounds can be used against armored vehicles. These warheads are affixed to a [[rocket motor]] and stabilized in flight with fins. Some types of RPG are single-use disposable units, such as the [[RPG-22]] and [[M72 LAW]]; with these units, once the rocket is fired, the entire launcher is disposed of. Others are reloadable, such as the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[RPG-7]] and the Israeli [[B-300]]. With reloadable RPGs, a new rocket can be inserted into the muzzle of the weapon after firing. \n\nThe launcher is designed so that the rocket exits the launcher without discharging an exhaust that would be dangerous to the operator (an issue that tended to affect the earliest RPG weapon systems such as the German [[Panzerschreck]], which featured a metal shield for the operator attached to the launch tube). In the case of the RPG-7, the rocket is launched by a [[gunpowder]] booster charge, and the rocket motor ignites only after 10&nbsp;metres. In some other designs, the propellant charge burns completely within the tube.\n\nAn RPG is an inexpensive way of delivering an explosive payload or warhead over a distance with moderate accuracy. Substantially more expensive guided [[anti-tank missile]]s are used at larger distances or when accuracy is paramount. Some anti-tank missiles, such as the [[AT-3 Sagger|Sagger]], can be guided after firing by the operator. An RPG is not normally guided towards the target by heat sensors or IR signatures. Nor can most RPG rockets be controlled in flight after being aimed and launched. While the lack of active targeting technologies or after-firing guidance input can be viewed as a challenge or weak point, it also makes it hard to defend against RPGs with electronic countermeasures, jamming or similar approaches. For example, if a soldier or other fighter launches an RPG at a hovering helicopter, even if the helicopter releases chaff flares, engages in signal jamming or releases radar-fooling foil, this will have no effect on a typical RPG warhead in flight, even if these measures might protect against more sophisticated surface-to-air missiles.\n=== Warheads ===\n[[File:Krtsanisi National Training Center, Georgia (5).jpg|thumb|left|200px|[[Georgia (country)|Georgian]] soldiers prepare to fire a rocket propelled grenade]]\n[[File:Rebel in northern Central African Republic 04.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Rebel in northern Central African Republic]]\n[[File:ASC Leiden - Coutinho Collection - 19 11 - Manten military base in the liberated areas, Guinea-Bissau - 1974.tif|thumb|Guerilla of the PAIGC resistance movement against Portugal showing his RPG, Guinea-Bissau, 1974.]]\n\nThe HEAT ([[high explosive anti-tank]]) round is a standard shaped charge warhead, similar in concept to those used in many<!--the major tank developing countries also use fin-stabilized APDS from their smoothbore guns, while the british use HESH and spin-stabilized APDS from their rifle guns.--> tank cannon rounds. In this type of warhead, the shape of the explosive material within the warhead focuses the explosive energy on a copper (or similar metal) lining. This heats the metal lining and propels some of it forward at a very high velocity in a highly plastic state. The resulting narrow jet of metal can defeat armor equivalent to several hundred millimeters of RHA, such as that used in light and medium armored vehicles. However, heavily armored vehicles, such as main battle tanks, are generally too well armored to be penetrated by an RPG, unless weaker sections of the armor are exploited. Various warheads are also capable of causing secondary damage to vulnerable systems (especially sights, tracks, rear and roof of turrets) and other soft targets. The warhead detonates on impact or when the fuse runs out; usually the fuse is set to the maximum burn of the rocket motor, but it can be shortened for [[Battle of Mogadishu (1993)|improvised anti aircraft]] purposes.<ref name=\"maritimesecurity\"/>\n\nSpecialized warheads are available for illumination, smoke, tear gas, and white phosphorus. Russia, China, and many former Warsaw Pact nations have also developed a [[thermobaric weapon|fuel-air explosive]] (thermobaric) warhead. Another recent development is a tandem HEAT warhead<ref name=\"strategypage\"/> capable of penetrating [[reactive armor]].\n\nSo-called PRIGs (Propelled Recoilless Improvised Grenade) were improvised warheads used by the [[Provisional IRA]].\n\n=== Effectiveness ===\n\nThe [[RPG-29]] uses a [[tandem-charge]] [[high explosive anti-tank]] warhead to penetrate [[explosive reactive armor]] (ERA) as well as composite armor behind it. It is capable of penetrating MBTs, such as the [[M1 Abrams]], older model Mark II version of the [[Merkava]],<ref name=\"Haaretz\"/> [[Challenger 2]] and [[T-90]].<ref name=\"kiev\"/>{{Dubious |reason=Author admits tests where faked|date=August 2018}}\n\nIn August 2006, in [[al-Amarah]], in Iraq, a Soviet RPG-29 damaged the front underside of a Challenger 2 tank, detonating ERA in the area of the driver's cabin. The driver lost part of a foot and two more of the crew were injured, but the driver was able to reverse {{convert|2.4|km|abbr=on}} to an aid post. The incident was not made public until May 2007; in response to accusations, the MoD said \"We have never claimed that the Challenger 2 is impenetrable.\" Since then, the ERA has been replaced with a [[Chobham armour|Dorchester block]] and the steel underbelly lined with armor, as part of the 'Streetfighter' upgrade, which was a direct response to this incident.<ref name=\"Rayment\"/> In May 2008, ''[[The New York Times]]'' disclosed that an American M1 tank had also been damaged by an RPG-29 in Iraq.<ref name=\"Gordon\"/> The American army is ranking the [[RPG-29]] threat to American armor as high; they have refused to allow the newly formed Iraqi army to buy it, fearing that it would fall into the hands of insurgents.<ref name=\"Grant\"/>\n\nVarious armies and manufacturers have developed add-on tank armor and other systems for [[Urban warfare|urban combat]], such as the [[Tank Urban Survival Kit]] (TUSK) for M1 Abrams, [[slat armor]] for the [[Stryker]], ERA kit for the [[FV432 AFV|FV432]], AZUR for [[Leclerc tank|Leclerc]], and others. Similar solutions are [[active protection system]]s (APS), engaging and destroying closing projectiles, such as the Russian [[Drozd]] and [[Arena Active Protection System|Arena]], as well as the recent Israeli [[TROPHY Active Protection System]].\n\nThe [[RPG-30]] was designed to address the threat of active protection systems on tanks by using a false target to trick the APS.<ref name=\"ARMS-TASS\"/> The RPG-30 shares a close resemblance with the [[RPG-27]] in that it is a man-portable, disposable anti-tank rocket launcher with a single shot capacity. However, unlike the RPG-27, there is a smaller diameter precursor round in a smaller side barrel tube in addition to the main round in the main tube. This precursor round acts as a false target, tricking the target's active protection system into engaging it, allowing the main round a clear path into the target, while the APS is stuck in the 0.2\u20130.4 second delay it needs to start its next engagement. Recent German systems were able to reduce reaction delay to mere milliseconds, cancelling this advantage.<ref name=\"ARMS-TASS\"/>\n\nThe PG-30 is the main round of the RPG-30. The round is a 105-mm tandem shaped charge with a weight of 10.3-kg (22.7-lb) and has a range of 200 meters and a stated penetration capability in excess of 600-mm (24-in) [[rolled homogeneous armor]] (RHA) (after ERA), 1500-mm reinforced concrete, 2000-mm brick and 3700-mm of soil.<ref name=\"ARMS-TASS\"/> Reactive armor, including explosive reactive armor (ERA), can be defeated with multiple hits into the same place, such as by tandem-charge weapons, which fire two or more shaped charges in rapid succession.\n\n=== Protection ===\n\nAn early method of disabling shaped charges developed during World War II was to apply thin skirt armor or meshwire at a distance around the hull and turret of the tank. The skirt or mesh armor ([[cage armor]]) triggers the RPG on contact and much of the molten jet that a shaped charge produces dissipates before coming into contact with the main armor of the vehicle.<ref name=\"stugiii\"/> Well-sloped armor also gives some protection because the shaped charge is forced to penetrate a greater amount of armor due to the oblique angle.<ref name=\"panzerworld\"/> The benefits of cage armor are still considered great in modern battlefields in the Middle East,<ref name=\"defensetech\"/> and although similar effects can be obtained using [[spaced armor]], either as a part of the original design or as [[Appliqu\u00e9 armor#Appliqu\u00e9 armour|appliqu\u00e9 armor]] fitted later, cage armor is preferable due to its low weight and ease of repair.\n\nToday, technologically advanced armies have implemented [[composite armor]]s such as [[Chobham armor]], which provide superior protection to steel. For added protection, vehicles may be retrofitted with reactive armor; on impact, reactive tiles explode or deform, disrupting the normal function of the shaped charge. Russian and Israeli vehicles also use active protection systems such as Drozd, Arena APS or Trophy. Such a system detects and shoots down incoming projectiles before they reach the vehicle. As in all arms races, these developments in armor countermeasures have led to the development of RPG rounds designed specifically to defeat them, with methods such as a tandem-charge warhead, which has two shaped charges, of which the first is meant to activate any reactive armor, and the second to penetrate the vehicle.\n\n== Weapons by country ==\n\n=== United States ===\n\nThe [[United States Army]] developed a lightweight antitank weapon (LAW) in the middle 1950s. By 1961, the [[M72 LAW]] was in use. It is a shoulder-fired, disposable rocket launcher with HEAT warhead. It is a recoilless weapon, which is easy to use, and effective against armored vehicles. It was used during the Vietnam War, and is still in use today. It uses a fin-stabilized rocket. In response to the threat of thicker armor, this weapon was replaced by the [[AT4]] recoilless rifle, a larger & non-collapsible&nbsp;\u2013 albeit still single-shot weapon.\n\nThe [[United States Marine Corps]] uses a different launcher, which is reloadable&nbsp;\u2013 the [[Shoulder-Launched Multipurpose Assault Weapon]] (SMAW). Unlike the RPG, it is reloaded from the breech-end rather than the muzzle.\n\n*[[Bazooka]]\n*[[M72 LAW]] \n*[[Mk 153 Shoulder-Launched Multipurpose Assault Weapon (SMAW)]]\n*[[M141 Bunker Defeat Munition]]\n*[[PSRL-1]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.militaryfactory.com/smallarms/detail.asp?smallarms_id=1074|title=AirTronic PSRL-1 (RPG-7USA) Anti-Armor / Anti-Personnel Shoulder-Fired Rocket Launcher|access-date=2017-11-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171201040244/https://www.militaryfactory.com/smallarms/detail.asp?smallarms_id=1074|archive-date=2017-12-01|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.airtronic-usa.com/products/airtronic-rpg-7-usa/|title=AirTronic USA -

Both missed the target, with one hitting a [[Yugoslav Airlines]]'s [[DC-9]] instead.<ref name=\"Wardlaw\"/>\n\nIn Afghanistan, [[Mujahideen]] guerrillas used RPG-7s to destroy [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] vehicles. To assure a kill, two to four RPG shooters would be assigned to each vehicle. Each armored-vehicle hunter-killer team can have as many as 15 RPGs.<ref name=\"hunter-killer\"/> In areas where vehicles were confined to a single path (a mountain road, swamps, snow, urban areas), RPG teams trapped convoys by destroying the first and last vehicles in line, preventing movement of the other vehicles. This tactic was especially effective in cities. Convoys learned to avoid approaches with overhangs and to send infantrymen forward in hazardous areas to detect the RPG teams.\n\nMultiple shooters were also effective against heavy tanks with [[reactive armor]]: The first shot would be against the driver's viewing prisms. Following shots would be in pairs, one to set off the reactive armor, the second to penetrate the tank's armor. Favored weak spots were the top and rear of the turret.<ref name=\"Grant\"/><ref name=\"Grau\"/>\n\nAfghans sometimes used RPG-7s at extreme range, exploded by their 4.5-second self-destruct timer, which translates to roughly 950m flight distance, as a method of long distance approach denial for infantry and reconnaissance.<ref name=\"Harnden\"/> The most noteworthy use of RPGs against aircraft in Afghanistan occurred on 6 August 2011 when Taliban fighters shot down a U.S. CH-47 Chinook helicopter killing all 38 personnel on board including SEAL Team 6 from a range of 220 meters.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}} An earlier anti-aircraft kill by the Taliban occurred during Operation Red Wings, on 28 June 2005 when a Chinook helicopter was destroyed by unguided rocket propelled grenades.\n\nIn the [[History of Iraq (2003\u20132011)|period following the 2003 invasion of Iraq]], the RPG became a favorite weapon of the insurgent forces fighting U.S. troops. Since most of the readily available [[RPG-7]] rounds cannot penetrate [[M1 Abrams]] tank armor from almost any angle, it is primarily effective against soft-skinned or lightly armored vehicles, and infantry. Even if the RPG hit does not completely disable the tank or kill the crew, it can still damage external equipment, lowering the tank's effectiveness or forcing the crew to abandon and destroy it. Newer RPG-7 rounds are more capable, and in August 2006, an RPG-29 round penetrated the frontal ERA of a [[Challenger 2]] tank during an engagement in [[al-Amarah]], [[Iraq]], and wounded several crew members.<ref name=\"Rayment\"/>\n\nRPGs were a main tool used by the [[FMLN]]'s guerrilla forces in the [[Salvadoran Civil War]]. For example, during the June 19, 1986 overrun of the San Miguel Army base, FMLN sappers dressed only in black shorts, their faces blacked out with grease, sneaked through barbed wire at night, avoiding the searchlights, they made it to within firing range of the outer wall. Using RPGs to initiate the attack, they blew through the wall and killed a number of Salvadorean soldiers. They eliminated the outermost sentries and searchlights with the rockets, then made it into the inner wall, which they also punched through. They were then able to create mayhem as their comrades attacked from the outside.<ref name=\"Spencer\"/>\n\nDuring the [[First Chechen War|First]] (1994\u20131996) and [[Second Chechen War]]s (1999\u20132009), [[Chechnya|Chechen]] rebels used RPGs to attack Russian tanks from basements and high rooftops. This tactic was effective because tank main guns could not be depressed or raised far enough to return fire, in addition, armor on the very top and bottom of tanks is usually the weakest. Russian forces had to rely on [[artillery]] suppression, good crew gunners and infantry screens to prevent such attacks. Tank columns were eventually protected by attached [[self-propelled anti-aircraft gun]]s ([[ZSU-23-4 Shilka]], [[9K22 Tunguska]]) used in the ground role to suppress and destroy Chechen ambushes. Chechen fighters formed independent \"cells\" that worked together to destroy a specific Russian armored target. Each cell contained small arms and some form of RPG ([[RPG-7]]V or [[RPG-18]], for example). The small arms were used to button the tank up and keep any infantry occupied, while the RPG gunner struck at the tank. While doing so, other teams would attempt to fire at the target in order to overwhelm the Russians' ability to effectively counter the attack. To further increase the chance of success, the teams took up positions at different elevations where possible. Firing from the third and higher floors allowed good shots at the weakest armor (the top).<ref name=\"Chechnya\"/> When the Russians began moving in tanks fitted with [[Reactive armor|explosive reactive armor]] (ERA), the Chechens had to adapt their tactics, because the RPGs they had access to were unlikely to result in the destruction of the tank.\n\nUsing RPGs as improvized anti-aircraft batteries has proved successful in Somalia, Afghanistan and Chechnya. [[Helicopter]]s are typically ambushed as they land, take off or hover. In [[Afghanistan]], the [[Mujahideen]] often modified RPGs for use against Soviet helicopters by adding a curved pipe to the rear of the launcher tube, which diverted the backblast, allowing the RPG to be fired upward at aircraft from a prone position. This made the operator less visible prior to firing and decreased the risk of injury from hot exhaust gases. The Mujahideen also utilized the 4.5-second timer on RPG rounds to make the weapon function as part of a [[flak]] battery, using multiple launchers to increase hit probabilities. At the time, Soviet helicopters countered the threat from RPGs at landing zones by first clearing them with anti-personnel [[suppression fire|saturation fire]]. The Soviets also varied the number of accompanying helicopters (two or three) in an effort to upset Afghan force estimations and preparation. In response, the Mujahideen prepared dug-in firing positions with top cover, and again, Soviet forces altered their tactics by using air-dropped [[thermobaric weapon|thermobaric fuel-air bombs]] on such landing zones. As the U.S.-supplied [[FIM-92 Stinger|Stinger]] [[surface-to-air missile]]s became available to them, the Afghans abandoned RPG attacks as the smart missiles proved especially efficient in the destruction of unarmed Soviet transport helicopters, such as [[Mil Mi-17]].

The French fleet had the year before blockaded the [[British Army during the American War of Independence|British Army]] at Chesapeake Bay during the [[Siege of Yorktown]] and supported the eventual American victory in their revolution.\n\nThe French suffered heavy casualties at the Saintes and many were taken prisoner, including the admiral, Comte de Grasse. Four French ships of the line were captured (including the [[flagship]]) and one was destroyed. Rodney was credited with pioneering the tactic of \"[[Naval tactics in the Age of Sail|breaking the line]]\" in the battle, though this is disputed.<ref name=\"O'Shaugh\"/><ref>Valin p.67-68</ref>\n\n==Background==\nIn October 1781, Admiral Comte de Grasse, commander of the French fleet in the West Indies; [[Francisco Saavedra de Sangronis]], General Bureau for the Spanish Indies; and [[Bernardo de G\u00e1lvez]], court representative and aide to the Spanish [[Governor of Louisiana]], developed a plan against British forces. The strategic objectives of the Franco-Spanish military forces in the West Indies in this plan were:\n* to aid the Americans and defeat the British naval squadron at [[New York City|New York]]\n* to capture the British [[Windward Islands]] and\n* to conquer Jamaica.<ref>Dull p. 244</ref>\n\nThis plan became known as the \"De Grasse \u2013 Saavedra Convention\". The first objective was essentially met by the surrender of the British army under [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|General Cornwallis]] at the [[Siege of Yorktown]] in September 1781. Grasse and his fleet [[Battle of the Chesapeake|played a decisive part]] in that victory, after which they returned to the Caribbean. On arrival in [[Saint Domingue]] in November 1781, the admiral was notified to proceed with a plan for the conquest of Jamaica.<ref>Dull p. 248-49</ref>\n\nJamaica was the largest and most profitable British island in the Caribbean, mainly because of [[sugar]]; it was more valuable to the British economy than all of the thirteen American colonies. [[King George III]] wrote to [[John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich|Lord Sandwich]], saying that he would risk protecting Britain's important Caribbean islands at the risk of Britain herself, and this was the strategy implemented in 1779.<ref>O'Shaughnessy p. 208</ref> Sugar made up 20% of all British imports and was worth five times as much as [[tobacco]].<ref>Rogozi\u0144ski p. 115</ref> The French and Spanish were fighting to take over Jamaica in order to expel the British from the West Indies, and to strike a massive blow against the British economy.<ref>Trew p. 154-55</ref> The courts at [[Paris]] and [[Madrid]] perceived the invasion of Jamaica as an alternative to the [[Great Siege of Gibraltar|Spanish and French attempts to take Gibraltar]], which for two years had been a costly disaster.<ref>Dull p. 282</ref>\n\nWhile Grasse waited for reinforcements to undertake the Jamaica campaign, he [[Siege of Brimstone Hill|captured St. Kitts]] in February 1782. The rest of the [[Windward Islands]] - [[Antigua]], [[St Lucia]], and [[Barbados]] - still remained under British control. Admiral George Rodney arrived in the Caribbean theater the following month, bringing reinforcements. These included seventeen ships of the line and gave the British a slight numerical advantage.<ref name=\"Trew\">Trew p. 157-62</ref>\n\nOn 7 April 1782, Grasse set out from [[Martinique]] with 35 [[ships of the line]], including two 50-gun ships and a large convoy of more than 100 cargo ships, to meet with a Spanish fleet of 12 ships of the line. In addition,  Grasse was to rendezvous with 15,000 troops at Saint Domingue, who were earmarked for the conquest and intended to land on Jamaica's north coast.<ref name=\"Trew\"/> Rodney, on learning of this, sailed from [[St Lucia]] in pursuit with 36 [[ships of the line]] the following day.<ref name=\"Mahan1\">Mahan. p. 205\u2212226</ref>\n\nThe British [[Hull (watercraft)|hulls]] by this time had been given [[copper sheathing]] to protect them from [[barnacle|marine growth]] and [[biofouling|fouling]], as well as salt water corrosion. This dramatically improved speed and sailing performance as a whole in good wind.<ref name=\"Lavery\">Lavery p. 144-45</ref>\n\n===The Lines===\n[[File:Plan of the early ship movements leading to the Battle of the Saintes April 1782.jpg|thumb|280px|Plan of the early ship movements leading to the Battle of the Saintes April 1782]]\nThe British flagship was [[HMS Formidable (1777)|HMS ''Formidable'']] under [[Admiral Rodney]]. Second in command was [[Sir Samuel Hood, 1st Baronet|Admiral Samuel Hood]] and third was Vice Admiral [[Francis Samuel Drake]]. As was the convention of the day the fleet was split into three sections: Rodney had individual control as [[Admiral of the White]] of 12 ships flying the [[White Ensign]]; Drake had command of 12 ships flying the [[Blue Ensign]] as [[Admiral of the Blue]]; Hood was [[Admiral of the Red]] with 12 ships flying the [[Red Ensign]].<ref name=\"Fraser102\">{{Harvnb|Fraser|1904|p=102}}</ref>\n\nThe Formidable was accompanied by three 98-gun ships: [[HMS Barfleur (1768)|HMS ''Barfleur'']] (commanded by Hood), [[HMS Prince George (1772)|HMS ''Prince George'']] and [[HMS Duke (1777)|HMS ''Duke'']] plus the 90-gun [[HMS Namur (1756)|HMS ''Namur'']]. The remaining 31 ships ranged from 64-gun to 74-gun. In total the British armada had 2620 guns in comparison to the French having 2526, but the French armour was superior. Most of the British fleet was equipped with [[carronade]]s on the upper decks, which had a major advantage of flexibility, and were a great advantage at close quarters.<ref name=\"Fraser102\"/>\n\nIn March 1782, ''Formidable'' was stationed at Gros Islet Bay between the island of [[St. Lucia]] in the [[West Indies]] and [[Pigeon Island (Saint Lucia)|Pigeon Island]]. It was under the command of Admiral [[George Brydges Rodney, 1st Baron Rodney|Admiral Rodney]], serving as his flagship at the head of 36 [[ship of the line]]. Meanwhile the French admiral, [[Fran\u00e7ois Joseph Paul de Grasse|De Grasse]], headed 34 ship of the line at Fort Royal Bay in [[Martinique]]. Rodney had been dispatched from Britain with 12 well-fitted ships to rescue the West Indies from a series of attacks from the French which had already resulted in the loss of several islands. They joined 24 ships on St Lucia which had already seen action against the French and were undergoing repairs.<ref name=\"Fraser102\"/>\n\nThe French had allies in the Spanish, who had 13 ship of the line at [[Cape Haitien]] in [[San Domingo]]. Together with transport ships the Spanish had a considerable force of 24,000 men. They awaited the arrival of a further 10,000 French troops dispatched from [[Brest, France|Brest]], under escort of five men-of-war, to further boost their strength. The plan was that de Grasse's fleet, with at least 5000 further troops, would unite with the Spanish at Cape Haitien, and from there would attack and capture the island of [[Jamaica]] with their conjoined armada of some 60 ships and some 40,000 troops.\n\nRodney had been in communication with De Grasse during March organising the exchange of prisoners, which were conveyed by [[HMS Alert (1779)|HMS ''Alert'']] under Captain Vashon. The two officers had much mutual respect. Rodney's task was to intercept the French fleet en route to Cape Haitien.\n\nGrasse's vice admiral at the time was [[Louis-Philippe de Rigaud, Marquis de Vaudreuil]]. Third in command was [[Louis Antoine de Bougainville]]. The French flagship was the huge 104-gun [[French ship Ville de Paris (1764)|Ville de Paris]]. The troops were under the command of the [[Marquis de Bouille]]. The French fleet was also split into three squadrons: De Grasse led the \"Cornette Blanche\"; Bougainville led the \"Escadre Bleu\"; de Vaudreuil as a second-in-command flew the mixed blue and white colours of the \"Blanche et Bleu\".<ref name=\"Fraser102\"/>\n\nOther British commanders included [[Lord Robert Manners (Royal Navy officer)|Lord Robert Manners]] of [[HMS Resolution (1770)|HMS ''Resolution'']]. Admiral [[William Cornwallis]] was in command of [[HMS Canada (1765)|HMS ''Canada'']]. [[HMS Monarch (1765)|HMS ''Monarch'']] was under the command of [[Francis Reynolds-Moreton, 3rd Baron Ducie|Captain Reynolds]]. Other aristocrats present included [[James Cranstoun, 8th Lord Cranstoun|Captain Lord Cranstoun]] on the ''Formidable''. Sir Charles Douglas, a nephew of [[Charles Douglas, 3rd Duke of Queensberry]], was Captain of the Fleet. [[James Wallace (Royal Navy officer)|Sir James Wallace]] was also present.

On 5 April it was reported that the French troops were boarding the ships. At 8am on Sunday 8 April it was reported that the French fleet were leaving Fort Royal. Rodney's fleet called all men to join their ships and ships began leaving Gros Islet Bay at 10.30am.<ref name=\"Fraser80\">{{Harvnb|Fraser|1904|pp=80-81}}</ref>\n\nThe total French armada comprised 35 [[ship of the line]], 10 [[frigate]]s, and over 100 smaller ships. The smaller ships moved in advance of the men-of-war, heading for [[St. Pierre, Martinique|St Pierre]].<ref name=\"Fraser80\"/>\n\nJust past 4pm HMS ''Barfleur'' (under Hood) at the head of the British fleet espied 5 sails ahead which she presumed to be part of the French fleet. These came into view of the Formidable around two hours later, just before sunset. They pursued the French through the night. At 2am on 9 April [[HMS St Albans (1764)|HMS ''St Albans'']] dropped alongside Formidable, reporting that she, along with [[HMS Valiant (1759)|HMS ''Valiant'']], had located the French fleet in the darkness. Rodney rested for the remainder of the night.\n\nThe sun rose at 5.30am. The French fleet extended from 6 miles to 12 miles distant, navigating the waters between [[Dominica]] and [[Guadeloupe]]. The majority of the warships lay off [[Prince Rupert's Bay]].\n\nDue to a [[dead calm]] from 3am until 7am neither fleet could move. The initial wind only reached the ''Barfleur'' and its eight support ships, causing it to detach ahead of the main fleet, which lay in the [[Lee side|lee]] of Dominica. De Grasse saw the opportunity to cripple this advanced section and wheeled to begin the first attack.\n\n== Battle ==\nOn 9 April 1782, the copper-sheathed British fleet caught up with the French, who were surprised by their speed.<ref name\"Stevens173\">Stevens p. 173</ref> Admiral de Grasse ordered the French convoy to head into [[Guadeloupe]] for repair, forcing him to escort two fifty-gun ships (''Fier'' and ''Experiment''), and placing his fleet in line of battle in order to cover the retreat.<ref name=\"Stevens173\">{{Harvnb|Allen|2009|p=173}}</ref>\n\n===First encounters===\nHood's section of the fleet, headed by [[HMS Barfleur (1768)|HMS ''Barfleur'']], braced for the first attack. [[HMS Alfred (1778)|HMS Alfred]] taunted the 18 French ships under de Vaudreuil which approached, as the first action, by exposing her broadside to the approaching French but without consequence. The British patiently awaited the formal signal from Rodney on the Formidable, some six miles behind, and eventually received a red flag signal telling them to \"engage the enemy\". As the wind rose around noon it enabled most of the French fleet and part of the British fleet (including Rodney in the ''Formidable'') joined the melee. At this point the French outnumbered the British two to one.<ref name=\"Fraser86\">{{Harvnb|Fraser|1904|pp=86-89}}</ref> Captain William Bayne on the Alfred was killed during this action.<ref name=\"Fraser111\">{{Harvnb|Fraser|1904|p=111}}</ref>\n\nAfter an inconclusive encounter in which both sides suffered damage, Grasse realised that the remainder of the British fleet would soon be upon them. He broke off the engagement to withdraw a safe distance.<ref name=\"Trew\"/> Grasse moved his ships to the [[Saintes islands]] to the north (south of [[Gaudeloupe]]. Meanwhile Rodney reversed the order of his line to bring Drake's thus far undamaged ships to the front, and allow Hood to undertake repairs in the rear lines.<ref name=\"Fraser90\">{{Harvnb|Fraser|1904|pp=90-92}}</ref>\n\nOn 10 April the French began 10 miles distant but did not turn to engage, but instead continued on their original course. By nightfall that increased their separation to 15 miles. This appears partly due to a wrong presumption on Rodney's part that the French were going to turn to engage.<ref name=\"Fraser90\"/>\n\nOn Wednesday 11 April two French ships (the {{ship|French ship|Z\u00e9l\u00e9|1764|2}} and the [[French ship Magnanime (1779)|''Magnanime'']]) which had accidentally collided, and had fallen behind the main French fleet, came into view around noon. Rodney decided that attacking these two ships would cause de Grasse to return to protect them. This tactic worked and a large section of the French fleet turned to protect the pair. These movements were done without any physical attacks.<ref name=\"Fraser90\"/>\n\n===Main engagement===\n[[File:Battle of the Saintes plan.jpg|thumb|300px|Main stages of the battle]]\nOn 12 April, the French were ranged from 6 miles to 12 miles distant and were not in formation, as the two fleets manoeuvred between the northern end of Dominica and the Saintes, in what is known as the Saintes Passage. The unfortunate ''Z\u00e9l\u00e9'' had had a second collision during the night with one of its rescuers, the [[French ship Ville de Paris (1764)|''Ville de Paris'']]. It was now being towed to Basse Terre in Guadeloupe by [[French ship Astr\u00e9e|Astr\u00e9e]] (with [[Fran\u00e7ois Claude Amour, marquis de Bouill\u00e9|General de Bouille]] on board. They was chased by four British ships: [[HMS Monarch (1765)|''Monarch'']], [[HMS Valiant (1759)|''Valiant'']], [[HMS Centaur (1759)|''Centaur'']] and [[HMS Belliqueux (1780)|''Belliqueux'']]. De Grasse made for [[Guadeloupe]] and [[Glossary of nautical terms#B|bore up]] with his fleet to protect the ship and at the same time Rodney recalled his chasing ships and made the signal for [[line of battle]].<ref name=\"Mahan2\">Mahan p. 194\u2212221</ref>\n\nRear-Admiral Hood's van division were still making repairs from the action three days earlier, so he directed his rear division, under Rear Admiral [[Sir Francis Samuel Drake, 1st Baronet|Francis S. Drake]], to take the lead. At 7:40, {{HMS|Marlborough|1767|6}}, under Captain [[Taylor Penny]], led the British line and opened battle when he approached the centre of the French line.<ref name=\"Lavery\"/> Having remained parallel with the French, the ships of Drake's division passed the remaining length of de Grasse's line and the two sides exchanged [[broadside]]s, a typical naval engagement of this time.<ref name=\"Trew\"/>\n\n==== Initial attack ====\n[[HMS Marlborough (1767)|HMS ''Marlborough'']] under Captain [[Taylor Penny]] of [[Dorset]] headed the British attack.<ref name=\"Fraser103\">{{Harvnb|Fraser|1904|pp=103-05}}</ref>\n\nAs the battle progressed, the strong winds of the previous day and night began to temper and became more variable. As the French line passed down the British line, the sudden shift of wind let Rodney's flagship {{HMS|Formidable|1777|6}} and several other ships, including {{HMS|Duke|1777|6}} and {{HMS|Bedford|1775|6}}, sail toward the French line.<ref>Tanstall, Brian. ''Naval Warfare in the Age of Sail: the Evolution of Fighting Tactics 1680\u20141815''. Naval Institute Press, Annapolis, MD, 1990. p. 308. {{ISBN|1-55750-601-9}}</ref>\n\nAt 8 am, ''Formidable'' raised the red flag to permit the ''Marlborough'' to open fire and engage the French. At this point the ''Marlborough'' was opposite the [[French ship Dauphin Royal (1735)|''Dauphin Royal'']] who received her full broadside.<ref name=\"Fraser103\"/> Sixteen ships in line separated the ''Marlborough'' from the ''Formidable'' and each stood 200 metres apart. As each circled passed the French they fired a broadside against the French. Second, behind ''Marlborough'' was [[HMS Arrogant (1761)|HMS ''Arrogant'']] which had been recently re-equipped, managed three broadsides against one from the French as they passed. Third in line was [[HMS Alcide (1779)|HMS ''Alcide'']] under Captain Charles Thomson. Then followed [[HMS Nonsuch (1774)|HMS ''Nonsuch'']] under Captain Truscott then [[HMS Conqueror (1773)|HMS ''Conqueror'']] under Captain George Balfour.<ref name=\"Fraser103\"/>\n\nNext in line was Admiral Drake on HMS ''Princessa'' who was in command of the first twelve vessels and was followed by [[HMS Prince George (1772)|HMS ''Prince George'']] under Captain Williams. Then came the hundred year old [[HMS Neptune (1683)|HMS ''Torbay'']] under Captain Keppel and the year-old [[HMS Anson (1781)|HMS ''Anson'']] under Captain William Blair, who being on the main deck was struck by round shot at waist level and horrifically sliced in two. The blue squadron was then completed by [[HMS Fame (1759)|HMS ''Fame'']] and [[HMS Russell (1764)|HMS ''Russell'']] under Captain [[James Saumarez]].<ref name=\"Fraser107\">{{Harvnb|Fraser|1904|p=107}}</ref>\n\nThe white squadron under Rodney followed in exact formation after the blue. This was headed by [[HMS America (1777)|HMS ''America'']] under Captain Thompson. [[HMS Hercules (1759)|HMS ''Hercules'']] under Captain Henry Savage followed. Then came [[HMS Prothee (1780)|HMS ''Prothee'']] under Captain Buckner and [[HMS Resolution (1770)|HMS ''Resolution'']] under [[Lord Robert Manners (Royal Navy officer)|Captain Robert Manners]]. The 24-year-old Manners was the first casualty on his ship, and was severely injured in both legs and right arm and later died of these wounds.<ref name=\"Fraser110\">{{Harvnb|Fraser|1904|pp=110-11}}</ref> ''Resolution'' was followed by HMS ''Duke'' under [[Alan Gardner, 1st Baron Gardner|Captain Alan Gardner]].<ref name=\"Fraser110\"/>\n\nAs ''Formidable'' was in the centre of the British line it took her almost an hour to reach the centre of the action. All ships had to maintain a steady speed  and a she passed de Grasse's flagship, ''Ville de Paris'' of 104 guns the two met for the first time. The ''Ville de Paris'' was already damaged by the  fifteen ships ahead of ''Formidable'' in the line. Although it was a sunny day the smoke of the battle was like a dense fog.<ref name=\"Fraser113\">{{Harvnb|Fraser|1904|p=113}}</ref> ''Formidable'' entered the smoke and approached the ''Ville de Paris'' at 8.40am.<ref name=\"Fraser117\">{{Harvnb|Fraser|1904|pp=117-19}}</ref>\n\nThe counter movement of the fleets brought a series of ships opposite the ''Formidable'' in sequence behind the ''Ville de Paris'', the movements bringing about a different pairing of enemies every five minutes. Next was [[French ship \u00c7a Ira (1781)|''Couronne'']], followed by [[French ship \u00c9veill\u00e9 (1752)|''\u00c9veill\u00e9'']] under Le Gardeur de Tilly then the [[French ship Sceptre (1780)|''Sceptre'']] under the command of de Vaudreuil.<ref name=\"Fraser117\"/>\n\n====Breaking the Line====\nWithin an hour, the wind had shifted to the south, forcing the French line to separate and bear to the west, as it could not hold its course into the wind. This allowed the British to use their guns on both sides of their ships without any fear of return fire from the front and rear of the French ships they were passing between. The effect was greater with the use of [[carronade]]s, with which the British had just equipped nearly half their fleet; this relatively new short-range weapon was quicker to reload and more of them could be carried. {{HMS|Glorieux||2}} moving in the wake of the ''Ville de Paris'' under command of Captain D'Escars was the next victim; virtually a sitting duck due to damage in the previous ten minutes from HMS Duke, she was quickly pounded and dismasted by intense fire. In the confusion, four French ships beginning with [[French ship Diad\u00e8me (1756)|''Diadem'']] broke out of sequence (partly due to the uncontrollable speed of the mastless ''Glorieux''). ''Formidable'' turned to starboard and brought her port guns to bear on them.<ref name=\"Trew\"/> As a result, ''Formidable'' sailed through the gap, breaking the French line. This breach was further followed through by five other British ships.<ref name=\"Mahan1\"/> The breach was later recorded by [[Charles Dashwood (Royal Navy officer)|Charles Dashwood]] who was a midshipman on the ''Formidable'' on the day.<ref name=\"Fraser123\">{{Harvnb|Fraser|1904|p=123}}</ref>\n[[File:Battle-of-the-Saintes-12th-April-1782-William-Elliott-1784-871.jpg|thumb|330px|''Lord Rodney\u2019s flagship ''Formidable'' breaking through the French line at the battle of the Saintes, 12th  1782''; painted by [[William Elliott (lieutenant)|William Elliott]]]]\n\nAlthough the concept of \"breaking the line\" was born here, the concept is logically of mixed blessings, since in breaking the enemy line, one breaks one's own line. Whilst the movement has the advantage that guns can be fired on both port and starboard sides, it also exposes the ship to attack on both sides. The advantage in this instance was that many of the French gunners left their post, in fear of the ''Formidable''s three tiers of guns bearing down on them.<ref name=\"Fraser126\">{{Harvnb|Fraser|1904|p=126}}</ref>\n\nThe ''Diadem'' appears to have fully withdrawn from the battle at this stage, and many presumed her to be sunk. The ''Formidable'' was followed by [[HMS Namur (1756)|HMS ''Namur'']] under [[Robert Fanshawe (Royal Navy officer)|Captain Fanshawe]], then [[HMS St Albans (1764)|HMS ''St Albans'']] under [[Charles Inglis (c. 1731-1791)|Captain Inglis]]. These were followed by the deadly [[HMS Canada (1765)|HMS ''Canada'']] under Captain [[William Cornwallis]], [[HMS Repulse (1780)|HMS ''Repulse'']] under Captain Thomas Dumaresq, and [[HMS Ajax (1765)|HMS ''Ajax'']] under Captain Nicholas Charrington. Each of these fired further upon the hapless and already crippled ''Glorieux''.<ref name=\"Fraser122\">{{Harvnb|Fraser|1904|p=122}}</ref>\n\nSimultaneously, by accident of the smoke, Commodore [[Edmund Affleck]] on [[HMS Bedford (1775)|HMS ''Bedford'']], the hindmost ship of the central white squadron, accidentally sailed through the confused French line, between [[French ship C\u00e9sar (1768)|''Cesar'']] and [[French ship Hector (1756)|''Hector'']], only discovering this error when no enemy lay on his starboard side in the clearing smoke.<ref name=\"Fraser130\">{{Harvnb|Fraser|1904|pp=130-33}}</ref>\n \nThe ''Bedford'' was followed by Hood's red squadron and this broke the French line into three sections. In the confusion the two leading ships of the rear red squadron, [[HMS Prince William (1780)|HMS ''Prince William'']] and [[HMS Magnificent (1766)|HMS ''Magnificent'']] had somehow passed the ''Bedford'', who was now third in line within the red squadron, completely detached from its own white squadron.<ref name=\"Fraser130\"/> The whole red squadron then passed between ''Cesar'' and ''Hector'', causing each to be crippled. The final ship of the red squadron, [[HMS Royal Oak (1769)|HMS ''Royal Oak'']], passed the stern of the ''Cesar'' and delivered a final blow a few minutes after 11am. Both fleets then drifted apart for some time and became temporarily becalmed.<ref name=\"Fraser130\"/>\n\nAround noon, to the horror of both fleets, it was spotted that the waters were teaming with sharks attracted by the noise and blood. French casualties were greatly increased due to the high number of troops packed onto the lower decks: a minimum of 900 per ship and no less than 1300 on the ''Ville de Paris''. In order to lessen the confusion the French had been throwing the dead (and perhaps the near dead) overboard, and this was a rich feast for the sharks.<ref name=\"Fraser130\"/>\n\n===French flight===\n[[File:The Battle of the Saints, 12 April 1782 RMG BHC0444.tiff|thumb|''Battle of the Saintes April 1782'' by [[Nicholas Pocock]]]]\nThe French now lay totally to the leeward of the British fleet and the fleet stood between them and their destination. They had little option on the re-emergence of the wind but to sail west with the wind, and try to escape. At 1pm the former British ship [[HMS Richmond (1757)|HMS ''Richmond'']], now renamed ''Richemont'', under command of Captain De Mortemart but with [[Denis Decr\u00e8s]] in charge of the marines, was sent to join a towing cable to the heavily crippled ''Glorieux''. [[French ship Souverain|''Souverain'']] moved alongside to provide covering fire. However the British, with both wind and cannon-power in their favour, moved a number of ships up to block this movement. The captain of the ''Glorieux'' was already dead, and she was under command of the senior officer remaining: Lieutenant Trogoff de Kerlessi. The ''Souverain'' and ''Richmond'' retreated under heavy fire and Kerlessi had little option but to tear the flag from the mast and surrender, which was done to the ''Royal Oak''. Captain Burnett used this opportunity to restock his depleted powder supplies. Meanwhile HMS ''Monarch'' stood alongside [[HMS Andromache (1781)|HMS ''Andromache'']] who was acting as a supply ship to the British fleet, and forty barrels of powder were exchanged.<ref name=\"Fraser137\">{{Harvnb|Fraser|1904|pp=137-38}}</ref>\n\nIn the next action, around 1.30, {{HMS|Centaur|1759|6}} and ''[[HMS Bedford]]'' attacked the stricken {{ship|French ship|C\u00e9sar|1768|2}} which was under control of the [[Comte de Marigny]]. De Marigny refused to surrender and was seriously wounded in the first five minutes. Command then fell to his captain, Captain Paul.<ref name=\"Fraser137\"/>\n[[File:Combat naval 12 avril 1782-Dumoulin-IMG 5486.JPG|thumb|left|Depiction of the battle by [[Fran\u00e7ois Aim\u00e9 Louis Dumoulin]]]]\n\nWith their formation shattered and many of their ships severely damaged, the French fell away to the southwest in small groups.<ref name=\"Trew\"/> Rodney attempted to redeploy and make repairs before pursuing the French.<ref name=\"Gar1\"/> By 2pm, the wind had freshened and a general chase ensued. As the British pressed south, [[French ship Ardent (1764)|''Ardent'']]. After taking possession of ''Glorieux'' they caught up with the French rear at around 3pm. Admiral de Grasse signalled other ships to protect the ''Ville de Paris'', but this was only partially fulfilled. Nine ships from de Vaudreuil's squadron came to his aid. The British fleet bore down on this small group. In succession, Rodney's ships isolated the other three ships. ''C\u00e9sar'', which was soon totally dismasted and in flames, was captured by ''Centaur''.<ref name=roche>Roche, p.238</ref> Soon after 5pm the [[French ship Hector (1756)|Hector]] having been flanked by {{HMS|Canada|1765|6}} and {{HMS|Alcide|1779|6}} and soon became a complete dismasted wreck. Following the mortal wounding of its captain, De la Vicomte, his first lieutenant De Beaumanoir, lowered the ship's flag and surrendered to the ''Alcide''.<ref name=\"Fraser140\">{{Harvnb|Fraser|1904|p=140}}</ref>\n\n[[Louis Antoine de Bougainville]], who commanded {{ship|French ship|Auguste|1778|2}}, had ordered eight ships of his own division<ref name=\"Trew\"/> to aid ''Ville de Paris'' but only the ''Ardent'' had proceeded and its isolation caused it to be flanked by HMS ''Belliqueux'' and HMS ''Prince William'' and this soon led to its capture.<ref name=\"Fraser143\"/>\n\nAt 5.30 pm, de Grasse with ''Ville de Paris'', stood practically alone and had ''Barfleur'' in close pursuit, and ''Formidable'' close behind. Five ships from de Vaudreuil's squadron were trying to protect her, but none in close formation. These were ''Triumphante'' (Vaudreuil's flagship), ''Bourgogne'' (under De La Charette), ''Magnifique'' (Macarty Macteigne), ''Pluton'' (De Rion) and ''Marseillais'' (De Castellane-Majastre). Three ships from De Grasse's squadron also still remained: ''Languedoc'', ''Couronne'' and ''Sceptre''.<ref name=\"Fraser143\">{{Harvnb|Fraser|1904|pp=143-44}}</ref>\n\nDe Grasse's closest protector the ''Couronne'', moved away at the approach of HMS ''Canada'', which began the final attack on the ''Ville de Paris''. With little support and suffering huge losses in men, made another attempt to signal the fleet and gave the order \"to build the line on the starboard [[Tacking (sailing)|tack]]\", but again this was not done.<ref name=\"Mahan1\"/> By this time, most of the French fleet, apart from those ships that were surrounded, had retreated.\n\n===End of the battle===\nHMS ''Canada'' swept passed the ''Ville de Paris'' doing damage to the spars and slowing her further. HMS ''Russell'' under Captain Saumarez then moved diagonally along the stern of the flagship and fired a broadside which ripped the entire length of the ship. The Russell then moved to the leeward side to hamper the ship's retreat, whilst HMS ''Barfleur'' moved onto the opposite side. The ''Languedoc'' attempted to approach to give aid but was beaten back by HMS ''Duke''.<ref name=\"Fraser148\">{{Harvnb|Fraser|1904|pp=146-48}}</ref>\n\nThe ''Ville de Paris'' was in desperate condition with all masts damaged and the rudder shot away. At least 300 men were dead or injured in the cockpit. Around 6pm, being overwhelmed and suffering terrible losses, the ''Ville de Paris'' eventually [[Striking the colors|struck her colours]], signalling surrender.<ref name=\"troude155\">Troude, ''Batailles navales'', p. 155</ref> Hood approached on the ''Barfleur'', which de Grasse had indicated was his preferred method of surrender. In an ungentlemanly act Hood ordered one final broadside at close quarters, when de Grasse had already indicated surrender.<ref name=\"Fraser148\"/>\n\nThe boarding crew, which included the British fleet surgeon [[Gilbert Blane]], were horrified at the carnage;{{refn | name = nbBlane/Macintyre| group = lower-alpha |Blane noted, \"When boarded, ''Ville de Paris'' presented a scene of complete horror. The numbers killed were so great that the surviving, either from want of leisure, or through dismay, had not thrown the bodies of the killed overboard, so that the decks were covered with the blood and mangled limbs of the dead, as well as the wounded and dying\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Macintyre|first1=Donald|title=Admiral Rodney|date=1962|publisher=Norton|page=239}}</ref>}} Remarkably Admiral de Grasse appeared not to have a scratch on him, whilst every one of his officers had either been killed or wounded. Only three men were unwounded. Rodney boarded soon after, and Hood presented Grasse to him.<ref name=\"Trew\"/> With his surrender, the battle had effectively ended, except for a few long-range desultory shots and the retreat of many of the French ships in disorder.<ref name=\"Mahan1\"/>\n\nThe [[Louis-Philippe de Vaudreuil|Comte de Vaudreuil]] in {{ship|French ship|Sceptre|1780|2}}, seeing Grasse's fate through his telescope, took command of the remaining scattered French naval fleet. On 13 April, he had ten ships with him and sailed toward [[Cap-Ha\u00eftien|Cap-Fran\u00e7ais]].<ref name=\"Trew\"/> Rodney signalled his fleet not to pursue the remaining ships. The battle was therefore over.<ref name=\"Fraser152\">{{Harvnb|Fraser|1904|p=152}}</ref>\n\nLater that night, around 9pm, a fire begun by the entrapped French crew on the lower decks, breaking into the liquor store.

The allies hesitated, and indecision soon led to the abandonment of the attack on Jamaica.<ref name=\"Trew\"/>\n\nThe battle has been controversial, for three reasons:\n* Rodney's failure to follow up the victory by a pursuit was much criticised. Samuel Hood said that the 20 French ships would have been captured had the commander-in-chief maintained the chase. In 1899 the [[Navy Records Society]] published the ''Dispatches and Letters Relating to the Blockading of Brest''. In the introduction, they include a small biography of Admiral [[William Cornwallis]], who commanded the ''Canada'' at the Saintes. A poem purportedly written by him includes the lines:\n<center><blockquote>Had a chief worthy Britain commanded our fleet,<br />Twenty-five good French ships had been laid at our feet.<ref name=Leyland1899>{{cite book|last=Leyland|first =John|title=Dispatches and letters relating to the blockade of Brest, 1803\u20131805|publisher=Printed for the [[Navy Records Society]]|year=1899|isbn=|url =https://archive.org/details/dispatchesandle00leylgoog|page =xx}}</ref></blockquote></center>\n* The battle is famous for the innovative British tactic of \"breaking the line\", in which the British ships passed through a gap in the French line, engaging the enemy from leeward and throwing them into disorder.<ref name=\"O'Shaugh\"/> Historians disagree about whether the tactic was intentional or made possible by weather. And, if intentional, who should receive credit: Rodney{{refn | name = nbBlane| group = lower-alpha | ''According to [[dramatist]] [[Richard Cumberland (dramatist)|Richard Cumberland]], Rodney discussed breaking the line over dinner at Lord [[George Germain]]'s country residence at [[Buckhurst Park, Sussex|Stoneland]].

He was created a [[Peerage|peer]] with \u00a32,000 a year settled on the title in perpetuity for this victory. Hood was elevated to the peerage as well, while Drake and Affleck were made [[baronet]]s.<ref name=\"Mahan2\"/>\n\nFollowing the Franco-American [[Siege of Yorktown|victory at Yorktown]] the previous year, and the [[Second Rockingham Ministry|change of Government]] in England, peace negotiations among Britain, the American colonies, France, and Spain had begun in early 1782. The Battle of the Saintes transferred the strategic initiative to the British. The most likely next military action would be an attack on the French sugar islands. The French were consequently inclined to ameliorate their terms. Britain's dominance at sea was reasserted. The Americans realized they were unlikely to have much French support in the future. [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Richard Howe]] gained relief of the [[Great Siege of Gibraltar|Siege of Gibraltar]] by defeating the huge Franco-Spanish assault; the siege was subsequently lifted in February 1783.<ref name=\"Mahan1\"/> Initial articles of peace were [[Peace of Paris (1783)|signed in July]], with a [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|full treaty]] following in September 1783.\n\nAs a result of the battle, British naval tactics changed. The old method involved the attacking fleet spreading itself along the entire enemy line. In the five formal fleet actions involving the Royal Navy between the Battle of the Saintes and [[Battle of Trafalgar|Trafalgar]], all were victories for the British, which were achieved by the creation of localised numerical superiority.<ref name=\"Willis\">{{cite book |last1=Willis |first1=Sam |title=Fighting at Sea in the Eighteenth Century: The Art of Sailing Warfare |date=2008

The French fleet had the year before blockaded the [[British Army during the American War of Independence|British Army]] at Chesapeake Bay during the [[Siege of Yorktown]] and supported the eventual American victory in their revolution.\n\nThe French suffered heavy casualties at the Saintes and many were taken prisoner, including the admiral, Comte de Grasse. Four French ships of the line were captured (including the [[flagship]]) and one was destroyed. Rodney was credited with pioneering the tactic of \"[[Naval tactics in the Age of Sail|breaking the line]]\" in the battle, though this is disputed.<ref name=\"O'Shaugh\"/><ref>Valin p.67-68</ref>\n\n==Background==\nIn October 1781, Admiral Comte de Grasse, commander of the French fleet in the West Indies; [[Francisco Saavedra de Sangronis]], General Bureau for the Spanish Indies; and [[Bernardo de G\u00e1lvez]], court representative and aide to the Spanish [[Governor of Louisiana]], developed a plan against British forces. The strategic objectives of the Franco-Spanish military forces in the West Indies in this plan were:\n* to aid the Americans and defeat the British naval squadron at [[New York City|New York]]\n* to capture the British [[Windward Islands]] and\n* to conquer Jamaica.<ref>Dull p. 244</ref>\n\nThis plan became known as the \"De Grasse \u2013 Saavedra Convention\". The first objective was essentially met by the surrender of the British army under [[Charles Cornwallis, 1st Marquess Cornwallis|General Cornwallis]] at the [[Siege of Yorktown]] in September 1781. Grasse and his fleet [[Battle of the Chesapeake|played a decisive part]] in that victory, after which they returned to the Caribbean. On arrival in [[Saint Domingue]] in November 1781, the admiral was notified to proceed with a plan for the conquest of Jamaica.<ref>Dull p. 248-49</ref>\n\nJamaica was the largest and most profitable British island in the Caribbean, mainly because of [[sugar]]; it was more valuable to the British economy than all of the thirteen American colonies. [[King George III]] wrote to [[John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich|Lord Sandwich]], saying that he would risk protecting Britain's important Caribbean islands at the risk of Britain herself, and this was the strategy implemented in 1779.<ref>O'Shaughnessy p. 208</ref> Sugar made up 20% of all British imports and was worth five times as much as [[tobacco]].<ref>Rogozi\u0144ski p. 115</ref> The French and Spanish were fighting to take over Jamaica in order to expel the British from the West Indies, and to strike a massive blow against the British economy.<ref>Trew p. 154-55</ref> The courts at [[Paris]] and [[Madrid]] perceived the invasion of Jamaica as an alternative to the [[Great Siege of Gibraltar|Spanish and French attempts to take Gibraltar]], which for two years had been a costly disaster.<ref>Dull p. 282</ref>\n\nWhile Grasse waited for reinforcements to undertake the Jamaica campaign, he [[Siege of Brimstone Hill|captured St. Kitts]] in February 1782. The rest of the [[Windward Islands]] - [[Antigua]], [[St Lucia]], and [[Barbados]] - still remained under British control. Admiral George Rodney arrived in the Caribbean theater the following month, bringing reinforcements. These included seventeen ships of the line and gave the British a slight numerical advantage.<ref name=\"Trew\">Trew p. 157-62</ref>\n\nOn 7 April 1782, Grasse set out from [[Martinique]] with 35 [[ships of the line]], including two 50-gun ships and a large convoy of more than 100 cargo ships, to meet with a Spanish fleet of 12 ships of the line. In addition,  Grasse was to rendezvous with 15,000 troops at Saint Domingue, who were earmarked for the conquest and intended to land on Jamaica's north coast.<ref name=\"Trew\"/> Rodney, on learning of this, sailed from [[St Lucia]] in pursuit with 36 [[ships of the line]] the following day.<ref name=\"Mahan1\">Mahan. p. 205\u2212226</ref>\n\nThe British [[Hull (watercraft)|hulls]] by this time had been given [[copper sheathing]] to protect them from [[barnacle|marine growth]] and [[biofouling|fouling]], as well as salt water corrosion. This dramatically improved speed and sailing performance as a whole in good wind.<ref name=\"Lavery\">Lavery p. 144-45</ref>\n\n===The Lines===\n[[File:Plan of the early ship movements leading to the Battle of the Saintes April 1782.jpg|thumb|280px|Plan of the early ship movements leading to the Battle of the Saintes April 1782]]\nThe British flagship was [[HMS Formidable (1777)|HMS ''Formidable'']] under [[Admiral Rodney]]. Second in command was [[Sir Samuel Hood, 1st Baronet|Admiral Samuel Hood]] and third was Vice Admiral [[Francis Samuel Drake]]. As was the convention of the day the fleet was split into three sections: Rodney had individual control as [[Admiral of the White]] of 12 ships flying the [[White Ensign]]; Drake had command of 12 ships flying the [[Blue Ensign]] as [[Admiral of the Blue]]; Hood was [[Admiral of the Red]] with 12 ships flying the [[Red Ensign]].<ref name=\"Fraser102\">{{Harvnb|Fraser|1904|p=102}}</ref>\n\nThe Formidable was accompanied by three 98-gun ships: [[HMS Barfleur (1768)|HMS ''Barfleur'']] (commanded by Hood), [[HMS Prince George (1772)|HMS ''Prince George'']] and [[HMS Duke (1777)|HMS ''Duke'']] plus the 90-gun [[HMS Namur (1756)|HMS ''Namur'']]. The remaining 31 ships ranged from 64-gun to 74-gun. In total the British armada had 2620 guns in comparison to the French having 2526, but the French armour was superior. Most of the British fleet was equipped with [[carronade]]s on the upper decks, which had a major advantage of flexibility, and were a great advantage at close quarters.<ref name=\"Fraser102\"/>\n\nIn March 1782, ''Formidable'' was stationed at Gros Islet Bay between the island of [[St. Lucia]] in the [[West Indies]] and [[Pigeon Island (Saint Lucia)|Pigeon Island]]. It was under the command of Admiral [[George Brydges Rodney, 1st Baron Rodney|Admiral Rodney]], serving as his flagship at the head of 36 [[ship of the line]]. Meanwhile the French admiral, [[Fran\u00e7ois Joseph Paul de Grasse|De Grasse]], headed 34 ship of the line at Fort Royal Bay in [[Martinique]]. Rodney had been dispatched from Britain with 12 well-fitted ships to rescue the West Indies from a series of attacks from the French which had already resulted in the loss of several islands. They joined 24 ships on St Lucia which had already seen action against the French and were undergoing repairs.<ref name=\"Fraser102\"/>\n\nThe French had allies in the Spanish, who had 13 ship of the line at [[Cape Haitien]] in [[San Domingo]]. Together with transport ships the Spanish had a considerable force of 24,000 men. They awaited the arrival of a further 10,000 French troops dispatched from [[Brest, France|Brest]], under escort of five men-of-war, to further boost their strength. The plan was that de Grasse's fleet, with at least 5000 further troops, would unite with the Spanish at Cape Haitien, and from there would attack and capture the island of [[Jamaica]] with their conjoined armada of some 60 ships and some 40,000 troops.\n\nRodney had been in communication with De Grasse during March organising the exchange of prisoners, which were conveyed by [[HMS Alert (1779)|HMS ''Alert'']] under Captain Vashon. The two officers had much mutual respect. Rodney's task was to intercept the French fleet en route to Cape Haitien.\n\nGrasse's vice admiral at the time was [[Louis-Philippe de Rigaud, Marquis de Vaudreuil]]. Third in command was [[Louis Antoine de Bougainville]]. The French flagship was the huge 104-gun [[French ship Ville de Paris (1764)|Ville de Paris]]. The troops were under the command of the [[Marquis de Bouille]]. The French fleet was also split into three squadrons: De Grasse led the \"Cornette Blanche\"; Bougainville led the \"Escadre Bleu\"; de Vaudreuil as a second-in-command flew the mixed blue and white colours of the \"Blanche et Bleu\".<ref name=\"Fraser102\"/>\n\nOther British commanders included [[Lord Robert Manners (Royal Navy officer)|Lord Robert Manners]] of [[HMS Resolution (1770)|HMS ''Resolution'']]. Admiral [[William Cornwallis]] was in command of [[HMS Canada (1765)|HMS ''Canada'']]. [[HMS Monarch (1765)|HMS ''Monarch'']] was under the command of [[Francis Reynolds-Moreton, 3rd Baron Ducie|Captain Reynolds]]. Other aristocrats present included [[James Cranstoun, 8th Lord Cranstoun|Captain Lord Cranstoun]] on the ''Formidable''. Sir Charles Douglas, a nephew of [[Charles Douglas, 3rd Duke of Queensberry]], was Captain of the Fleet. [[James Wallace (Royal Navy officer)|Sir James Wallace]] was also present. Other commanders included Captains Inglefield, Parry, Dumaresq, Buckner, Graves, Blair, Burnett, Savage, Symons, Charrington, Inglis, Cornish, Truscott, Saumarez, Knight, Wilson, Williams and Wilkinson.<ref name=\"Fraser72\">{{Harvnb|Fraser|1904|p=72}}</ref>\n\nA look-out squadron, a line of frigates headed by Captain [[George Anson Byron]] on [[HMS Andromache (1781)|HMS ''Andromache'']], reported all of de Grasse's movements at Fort Royal. This squadron included the speedy [[HMS Agamemnon (1781)|HMS ''Agamemnon'']] and also [[HMS Magnificent (1766)|HMS ''Magnificent'']].<ref name=\"Fraser79\">{{Harvnb|Fraser|1904|p=79}}</ref>\n\n===Pre-Battle Movements===\n{| style=\"float: right; margin-right: 1em\"\n|-\n! style=\"background:#b0c4de;\"|Naval Commanders\n|-\n|<gallery>\nFile:Franecois joseph paul comte d115883.jpg|<center><br />[[Comte de Grasse]]</center>\nFile:Mosnier, George Rodney.jpg|<center><br />[[George Rodney]]</center>\n</gallery>\n|}\n\nOn 3 April it was signalled that the repairs on the French fleet were complete. On 5 April it was reported that the French troops were boarding the ships. At 8am on Sunday 8 April it was reported that the French fleet were leaving Fort Royal. Rodney's fleet called all men to join their ships and ships began leaving Gros Islet Bay at 10.30am.<ref name=\"Fraser80\">{{Harvnb|Fraser|1904|pp=80-81}}</ref>\n\nThe total French armada comprised 35 [[ship of the line]], 10 [[frigate]]s, and over 100 smaller ships. The smaller ships moved in advance of the men-of-war, heading for [[St. Pierre, Martinique|St Pierre]].<ref name=\"Fraser80\"/>\n\nJust past 4pm HMS ''Barfleur'' (under Hood) at the head of the British fleet espied 5 sails ahead which she presumed to be part of the French fleet. These came into view of the Formidable around two hours later, just before sunset. They pursued the French through the night. At 2am on 9 April [[HMS St Albans (1764)|HMS ''St Albans'']] dropped alongside Formidable, reporting that she, along with [[HMS Valiant (1759)|HMS ''Valiant'']], had located the French fleet in the darkness. Rodney rested for the remainder of the night.\n\nThe sun rose at 5.30am. The French fleet extended from 6 miles to 12 miles distant, navigating the waters between [[Dominica]] and [[Guadeloupe]]. The majority of the warships lay off [[Prince Rupert's Bay]].\n\nDue to a [[dead calm]] from 3am until 7am neither fleet could move. The initial wind only reached the ''Barfleur'' and its eight support ships, causing it to detach ahead of the main fleet, which lay in the [[Lee side|lee]] of Dominica. De Grasse saw the opportunity to cripple this advanced section and wheeled to begin the first attack.\n\n== Battle ==\nOn 9 April 1782, the copper-sheathed British fleet caught up with the French, who were surprised by their speed.<ref name\"Stevens173\">Stevens p. 173</ref> Admiral de Grasse ordered the French convoy to head into [[Guadeloupe]] for repair, forcing him to escort two fifty-gun ships (''Fier'' and ''Experiment''), and placing his fleet in line of battle in order to cover the retreat.<ref name=\"Stevens173\">{{Harvnb|Allen|2009|p=173}}</ref>\n\n===First encounters===\nHood's section of the fleet, headed by [[HMS Barfleur (1768)|HMS ''Barfleur'']], braced for the first attack. [[HMS Alfred (1778)|HMS Alfred]] taunted the 18 French ships under de Vaudreuil which approached, as the first action, by exposing her broadside to the approaching French but without consequence. The British patiently awaited the formal signal from Rodney on the Formidable, some six miles behind, and eventually received a red flag signal telling them to \"engage the enemy\". As the wind rose around noon it enabled most of the French fleet and part of the British fleet (including Rodney in the ''Formidable'') joined the melee. At this point the French outnumbered the British two to one.<ref name=\"Fraser86\">{{Harvnb|Fraser|1904|pp=86-89}}</ref> Captain William Bayne on the Alfred was killed during this action.<ref name=\"Fraser111\">{{Harvnb|Fraser|1904|p=111}}</ref>\n\nAfter an inconclusive encounter in which both sides suffered damage, Grasse realised that the remainder of the British fleet would soon be upon them. He broke off the engagement to withdraw a safe distance.<ref name=\"Trew\"/> Grasse moved his ships to the [[Saintes islands]] to the north (south of [[Gaudeloupe]]. Meanwhile Rodney reversed the order of his line to bring Drake's thus far undamaged ships to the front, and allow Hood to undertake repairs in the rear lines.<ref name=\"Fraser90\">{{Harvnb|Fraser|1904|pp=90-92}}</ref>\n\nOn 10 April the French began 10 miles distant but did not turn to engage, but instead continued on their original course. By nightfall that increased their separation to 15 miles. This appears partly due to a wrong presumption on Rodney's part that the French were going to turn to engage.<ref name=\"Fraser90\"/>\n\nOn Wednesday 11 April two French ships (the {{ship|French ship|Z\u00e9l\u00e9|1764|2}} and the [[French ship Magnanime (1779)|''Magnanime'']]) which had accidentally collided, and had fallen behind the main French fleet, came into view around noon. Rodney decided that attacking these two ships would cause de Grasse to return to protect them. This tactic worked and a large section of the French fleet turned to protect the pair. These movements were done without any physical attacks.<ref name=\"Fraser90\"/>\n\n===Main engagement===\n[[File:Battle of the Saintes plan.jpg|thumb|300px|Main stages of the battle]]\nOn 12 April, the French were ranged from 6 miles to 12 miles distant and were not in formation, as the two fleets manoeuvred between the northern end of Dominica and the Saintes, in what is known as the Saintes Passage. The unfortunate ''Z\u00e9l\u00e9'' had had a second collision during the night with one of its rescuers, the [[French ship Ville de Paris (1764)|''Ville de Paris'']]. It was now being towed to Basse Terre in Guadeloupe by [[French ship Astr\u00e9e|Astr\u00e9e]] (with [[Fran\u00e7ois Claude Amour, marquis de Bouill\u00e9|General de Bouille]] on board. They was chased by four British ships: [[HMS Monarch (1765)|''Monarch'']], [[HMS Valiant (1759)|''Valiant'']], [[HMS Centaur (1759)|''Centaur'']] and [[HMS Belliqueux (1780)|''Belliqueux'']]. De Grasse made for [[Guadeloupe]] and [[Glossary of nautical terms#B|bore up]] with his fleet to protect the ship and at the same time Rodney recalled his chasing ships and made the signal for [[line of battle]].<ref name=\"Mahan2\">Mahan p. 194\u2212221</ref>\n\nRear-Admiral Hood's van division were still making repairs from the action three days earlier, so he directed his rear division, under Rear Admiral [[Sir Francis Samuel Drake, 1st Baronet|Francis S. Drake]], to take the lead. At 7:40, {{HMS|Marlborough|1767|6}}, under Captain [[Taylor Penny]], led the British line and opened battle when he approached the centre of the French line.<ref name=\"Lavery\"/> Having remained parallel with the French, the ships of Drake's division passed the remaining length of de Grasse's line and the two sides exchanged [[broadside]]s, a typical naval engagement of this time.<ref name=\"Trew\"/>\n\n==== Initial attack ====\n[[HMS Marlborough (1767)|HMS ''Marlborough'']] under Captain [[Taylor Penny]] of [[Dorset]] headed the British attack.<ref name=\"Fraser103\">{{Harvnb|Fraser|1904|pp=103-05}}</ref>\n\nAs the battle progressed, the strong winds of the previous day and night began to temper and became more variable. As the French line passed down the British line, the sudden shift of wind let Rodney's flagship {{HMS|Formidable|1777|6}} and several other ships, including {{HMS|Duke|1777|6}} and {{HMS|Bedford|1775|6}}, sail toward the French line.<ref>Tanstall, Brian.

At this point the ''Marlborough'' was opposite the [[French ship Dauphin Royal (1735)|''Dauphin Royal'']] who received her full broadside.<ref name=\"Fraser103\"/> Sixteen ships in line separated the ''Marlborough'' from the ''Formidable'' and each stood 200 metres apart. As each circled passed the French they fired a broadside against the French. Second, behind ''Marlborough'' was [[HMS Arrogant (1761)|HMS ''Arrogant'']] which had been recently re-equipped, managed three broadsides against one from the French as they passed. Third in line was [[HMS Alcide (1779)|HMS ''Alcide'']] under Captain Charles Thomson. Then followed [[HMS Nonsuch (1774)|HMS ''Nonsuch'']] under Captain Truscott then [[HMS Conqueror (1773)|HMS ''Conqueror'']] under Captain George Balfour.<ref name=\"Fraser103\"/>\n\nNext in line was Admiral Drake on HMS ''Princessa'' who was in command of the first twelve vessels and was followed by [[HMS Prince George (1772)|HMS ''Prince George'']] under Captain Williams. Then came the hundred year old [[HMS Neptune (1683)|HMS ''Torbay'']] under Captain Keppel and the year-old [[HMS Anson (1781)|HMS ''Anson'']] under Captain William Blair, who being on the main deck was struck by round shot at waist level and horrifically sliced in two. The blue squadron was then completed by [[HMS Fame (1759)|HMS ''Fame'']] and [[HMS Russell (1764)|HMS ''Russell'']] under Captain [[James Saumarez]].<ref name=\"Fraser107\">{{Harvnb|Fraser|1904|p=107}}</ref>\n\nThe white squadron under Rodney followed in exact formation after the blue. This was headed by [[HMS America (1777)|HMS ''America'']] under Captain Thompson. [[HMS Hercules (1759)|HMS ''Hercules'']] under Captain Henry Savage followed. Then came [[HMS Prothee (1780)|HMS ''Prothee'']] under Captain Buckner and [[HMS Resolution (1770)|HMS ''Resolution'']] under [[Lord Robert Manners (Royal Navy officer)|Captain Robert Manners]]. The 24-year-old Manners was the first casualty on his ship, and was severely injured in both legs and right arm and later died of these wounds.<ref name=\"Fraser110\">{{Harvnb|Fraser|1904|pp=110-11}}</ref> ''Resolution'' was followed by HMS ''Duke'' under [[Alan Gardner, 1st Baron Gardner|Captain Alan Gardner]].<ref name=\"Fraser110\"/>\n\nAs ''Formidable'' was in the centre of the British line it took her almost an hour to reach the centre of the action. All ships had to maintain a steady speed  and a she passed de Grasse's flagship, ''Ville de Paris'' of 104 guns the two met for the first time. The ''Ville de Paris'' was already damaged by the  fifteen ships ahead of ''Formidable'' in the line. Although it was a sunny day the smoke of the battle was like a dense fog.<ref name=\"Fraser113\">{{Harvnb|Fraser|1904|p=113}}</ref> ''Formidable'' entered the smoke and approached the ''Ville de Paris'' at 8.40am.<ref name=\"Fraser117\">{{Harvnb|Fraser|1904|pp=117-19}}</ref>\n\nThe counter movement of the fleets brought a series of ships opposite the ''Formidable'' in sequence behind the ''Ville de Paris'', the movements bringing about a different pairing of enemies every five minutes. Next was [[French ship \u00c7a Ira (1781)|''Couronne'']], followed by [[French ship \u00c9veill\u00e9 (1752)|''\u00c9veill\u00e9'']] under Le Gardeur de Tilly then the [[French ship Sceptre (1780)|''Sceptre'']] under the command of de Vaudreuil.<ref name=\"Fraser117\"/>\n\n====Breaking the Line====\nWithin an hour, the wind had shifted to the south, forcing the French line to separate and bear to the west, as it could not hold its course into the wind. This allowed the British to use their guns on both sides of their ships without any fear of return fire from the front and rear of the French ships they were passing between. The effect was greater with the use of [[carronade]]s, with which the British had just equipped nearly half their fleet; this relatively new short-range weapon was quicker to reload and more of them could be carried. {{HMS|Glorieux||2}} moving in the wake of the ''Ville de Paris'' under command of Captain D'Escars was the next victim; virtually a sitting duck due to damage in the previous ten minutes from HMS Duke, she was quickly pounded and dismasted by intense fire. In the confusion, four French ships beginning with [[French ship Diad\u00e8me (1756)|''Diadem'']] broke out of sequence (partly due to the uncontrollable speed of the mastless ''Glorieux''). ''Formidable'' turned to starboard and brought her port guns to bear on them.<ref name=\"Trew\"/> As a result, ''Formidable'' sailed through the gap, breaking the French line. This breach was further followed through by five other British ships.<ref name=\"Mahan1\"/> The breach was later recorded by [[Charles Dashwood (Royal Navy officer)|Charles Dashwood]] who was a midshipman on the ''Formidable'' on the day.<ref name=\"Fraser123\">{{Harvnb|Fraser|1904|p=123}}</ref>\n[[File:Battle-of-the-Saintes-12th-April-1782-William-Elliott-1784-871.jpg|thumb|330px|''Lord Rodney\u2019s flagship ''Formidable'' breaking through the French line at the battle of the Saintes, 12th  1782''; painted by [[William Elliott (lieutenant)|William Elliott]]]]\n\nAlthough the concept of \"breaking the line\" was born here, the concept is logically of mixed blessings, since in breaking the enemy line, one breaks one's own line. Whilst the movement has the advantage that guns can be fired on both port and starboard sides, it also exposes the ship to attack on both sides. The advantage in this instance was that many of the French gunners left their post, in fear of the ''Formidable''s three tiers of guns bearing down on them.<ref name=\"Fraser126\">{{Harvnb|Fraser|1904|p=126}}</ref>\n\nThe ''Diadem'' appears to have fully withdrawn from the battle at this stage, and many presumed her to be sunk. The ''Formidable'' was followed by [[HMS Namur (1756)|HMS ''Namur'']] under [[Robert Fanshawe (Royal Navy officer)|Captain Fanshawe]], then [[HMS St Albans (1764)|HMS ''St Albans'']] under [[Charles Inglis (c. 1731-1791)|Captain Inglis]]. These were followed by the deadly [[HMS Canada (1765)|HMS ''Canada'']] under Captain [[William Cornwallis]], [[HMS Repulse (1780)|HMS ''Repulse'']] under Captain Thomas Dumaresq, and [[HMS Ajax (1765)|HMS ''Ajax'']] under Captain Nicholas Charrington. Each of these fired further upon the hapless and already crippled ''Glorieux''.<ref name=\"Fraser122\">{{Harvnb|Fraser|1904|p=122}}</ref>\n\nSimultaneously, by accident of the smoke, Commodore [[Edmund Affleck]] on [[HMS Bedford (1775)|HMS ''Bedford'']], the hindmost ship of the central white squadron, accidentally sailed through the confused French line, between [[French ship C\u00e9sar (1768)|''Cesar'']] and [[French ship Hector (1756)|''Hector'']], only discovering this error when no enemy lay on his starboard side in the clearing smoke.<ref name=\"Fraser130\">{{Harvnb|Fraser|1904|pp=130-33}}</ref>\n \nThe ''Bedford'' was followed by Hood's red squadron and this broke the French line into three sections. In the confusion the two leading ships of the rear red squadron, [[HMS Prince William (1780)|HMS ''Prince William'']] and [[HMS Magnificent (1766)|HMS ''Magnificent'']] had somehow passed the ''Bedford'', who was now third in line within the red squadron, completely detached from its own white squadron.<ref name=\"Fraser130\"/> The whole red squadron then passed between ''Cesar'' and ''Hector'', causing each to be crippled. The final ship of the red squadron, [[HMS Royal Oak (1769)|HMS ''Royal Oak'']], passed the stern of the ''Cesar'' and delivered a final blow a few minutes after 11am. Both fleets then drifted apart for some time and became temporarily becalmed.<ref name=\"Fraser130\"/>\n\nAround noon, to the horror of both fleets, it was spotted that the waters were teaming with sharks attracted by the noise and blood. French casualties were greatly increased due to the high number of troops packed onto the lower decks: a minimum of 900 per ship and no less than 1300 on the ''Ville de Paris''. In order to lessen the confusion the French had been throwing the dead (and perhaps the near dead) overboard, and this was a rich feast for the sharks.<ref name=\"Fraser130\"/>\n\n===French flight===\n[[File:The Battle of the Saints, 12 April 1782 RMG BHC0444.tiff|thumb|''Battle of the Saintes April 1782'' by [[Nicholas Pocock]]]]\nThe French now lay totally to the leeward of the British fleet and the fleet stood between them and their destination. They had little option on the re-emergence of the wind but to sail west with the wind, and try to escape. At 1pm the former British ship [[HMS Richmond (1757)|HMS ''Richmond'']], now renamed ''Richemont'', under command of Captain De Mortemart but with [[Denis Decr\u00e8s]] in charge of the marines, was sent to join a towing cable to the heavily crippled ''Glorieux''. [[French ship Souverain|''Souverain'']] moved alongside to provide covering fire. However the British, with both wind and cannon-power in their favour, moved a number of ships up to block this movement. The captain of the ''Glorieux'' was already dead, and she was under command of the senior officer remaining: Lieutenant Trogoff de Kerlessi. The ''Souverain'' and ''Richmond'' retreated under heavy fire and Kerlessi had little option but to tear the flag from the mast and surrender, which was done to the ''Royal Oak''. Captain Burnett used this opportunity to restock his depleted powder supplies. Meanwhile HMS ''Monarch'' stood alongside [[HMS Andromache (1781)|HMS ''Andromache'']] who was acting as a supply ship to the British fleet, and forty barrels of powder were exchanged.<ref name=\"Fraser137\">{{Harvnb|Fraser|1904|pp=137-38}}</ref>\n\nIn the next action, around 1.30, {{HMS|Centaur|1759|6}} and ''[[HMS Bedford]]'' attacked the stricken {{ship|French ship|C\u00e9sar|1768|2}} which was under control of the [[Comte de Marigny]]. De Marigny refused to surrender and was seriously wounded in the first five minutes. Command then fell to his captain, Captain Paul.<ref name=\"Fraser137\"/>\n[[File:Combat naval 12 avril 1782-Dumoulin-IMG 5486.JPG|thumb|left|Depiction of the battle by [[Fran\u00e7ois Aim\u00e9 Louis Dumoulin]]]]\n\nWith their formation shattered and many of their ships severely damaged, the French fell away to the southwest in small groups.<ref name=\"Trew\"/> Rodney attempted to redeploy and make repairs before pursuing the French.<ref name=\"Gar1\"/> By 2pm, the wind had freshened and a general chase ensued. As the British pressed south, [[French ship Ardent (1764)|''Ardent'']] They then took possession of ''Glorieux'' and caught up with the French rear at around 3pm. Admiral de Grasse signalled other ships to protect the ''Ville de Paris'', but this was only partially fulfilled. Nine ships from de Vaudreuil's squadron came to his aid. The British fleet bore down on this small group. In succession, Rodney's ships isolated the other three ships. ''C\u00e9sar'', which was soon totally dismasted and in flames, was captured by ''Centaur''.<ref name=roche>Roche, p.238</ref> Soon after 5pm the [[French ship Hector (1756)|Hector]] having been flanked by {{HMS|Canada|1765|6}} and {{HMS|Alcide|1779|6}} and soon became a complete dismasted wreck. Following the mortal wounding of its captain, De la Vicomte, his first lieutenant De Beaumanoir, lowered the ship's flag and surrendered to the ''Alcide''.<ref name=\"Fraser140\">{{Harvnb|Fraser|1904|p=140}}</ref>\n\n[[Louis Antoine de Bougainville]], who commanded {{ship|French ship|Auguste|1778|2}}, had ordered eight ships of his own division<ref name=\"Trew\"/> to aid ''Ville de Paris'' but only the ''Ardent'' had proceeded and its isolation caused it to be flanked by HMS ''Belliqueux'' and HMS ''Prince William'' and this soon led to its capture.<ref name=\"Fraser143\"/>\n\nAt 5.30 pm, de Grasse with ''Ville de Paris'', stood practically alone and had ''Barfleur'' in close pursuit, and ''Formidable'' close behind. Five ships from de Vaudreuil's squadron were trying to protect her, but none in close formation. These were ''Triumphante'' (Vaudreuil's flagship), ''Bourgogne'' (under De La Charette), ''Magnifique'' (under Macarty Macteigne), ''Pluton'' (under De Rion) and ''Marseillais'' (under De Castellane-Majastre). Three ships from De Grasse's squadron also still remained: ''Languedoc'', ''Couronne'' and ''Sceptre''.<ref name=\"Fraser143\">{{Harvnb|Fraser|1904|pp=143-44}}</ref>\n\nDe Grasse's closest protector the ''Couronne'', moved away at the approach of HMS ''Canada'', which began the final attack on the ''Ville de Paris''. With little support and suffering huge losses in men, made another attempt to signal the fleet and gave the order \"to build the line on the starboard [[Tacking (sailing)|tack]]\", but again this was not done.<ref name=\"Mahan1\"/> By this time, most of the French fleet, apart from those ships that were surrounded, had retreated.\n\n===End of the battle===\nHMS ''Canada'' swept passed the ''Ville de Paris'' doing damage to the spars and slowing her further. HMS ''Russell'' under Captain Saumarez then moved diagonally along the stern of the flagship and fired a broadside which ripped the entire length of the ship. The Russell then moved to the leeward side to hamper the ship's retreat, whilst HMS ''Barfleur'' moved onto the opposite side. The ''Languedoc'' attempted to approach to give aid but was beaten back by HMS ''Duke''.<ref name=\"Fraser148\">{{Harvnb|Fraser|1904|pp=146-48}}</ref>\n\nThe ''Ville de Paris'' was in desperate condition with all masts damaged and the rudder shot away. At least 300 men were dead or injured in the cockpit. Around 6pm, being overwhelmed and suffering terrible losses, the ''Ville de Paris'' eventually [[Striking the colors|struck her colours]], signalling surrender.<ref name=\"troude155\">Troude, ''Batailles navales'', p. 155</ref> Hood approached on the ''Barfleur'', which de Grasse had indicated was his preferred method of surrender. In an ungentlemanly act Hood ordered one final broadside at close quarters, when de Grasse had already indicated surrender.<ref name=\"Fraser148\"/>\n\nThe boarding crew, which included the British fleet surgeon [[Gilbert Blane]], were horrified at the carnage;{{refn | name = nbBlane/Macintyre| group = lower-alpha |Blane noted, \"When boarded, ''Ville de Paris'' presented a scene of complete horror. The numbers killed were so great that the surviving, either from want of leisure, or through dismay, had not thrown the bodies of the killed overboard, so that the decks were covered with the blood and mangled limbs of the dead, as well as the wounded and dying\".<ref>{{cite book|last1=Macintyre|first1=Donald|title=Admiral Rodney|date=1962|publisher=Norton|page=239}}</ref>}} Remarkably Admiral de Grasse appeared not to have a scratch on him, whilst every one of his officers had either been killed or wounded. Only three men were unwounded. Rodney boarded soon after, and Hood presented Grasse to him.<ref name=\"Trew\"/> With his surrender, the battle had effectively ended, except for a few long-range desultory shots and the retreat of many of the French ships in disorder.<ref name=\"Mahan1\"/>\n\nThe [[Louis-Philippe de Vaudreuil|Comte de Vaudreuil]] in {{ship|French ship|Sceptre|1780|2}}, seeing Grasse's fate through his telescope, took command of the remaining scattered French naval fleet. On 13 April, he had ten ships with him and sailed toward [[Cap-Ha\u00eftien|Cap-Fran\u00e7ais]].<ref name=\"Trew\"/> Rodney signalled his fleet not to pursue the remaining ships. The battle was therefore over.<ref name=\"Fraser152\">{{Harvnb|Fraser|1904|p=152}}</ref>\n\nLater that night, around 9pm, a fire begun by the entrapped French crew on the lower decks, breaking into the liquor store.

Disease took a hold of the French forces, in particular the soldiers, of whom thousands died. The allies hesitated, and indecision soon led to the abandonment of the attack on Jamaica.<ref name=\"Trew\"/>\n\nThe battle has been controversial, for three reasons:\n* Rodney's failure to follow up the victory by a pursuit was much criticised. Samuel Hood said that the 20 French ships would have been captured had the commander-in-chief maintained the chase. In 1899 the [[Navy Records Society]] published the ''Dispatches and Letters Relating to the Blockading of Brest''. In the introduction, they include a small biography of Admiral [[William Cornwallis]], who commanded the ''Canada'' at the Saintes. A poem purportedly written by him includes the lines:\n<center><blockquote>Had a chief worthy Britain commanded our fleet,<br />Twenty-five good French ships had been laid at our feet.<ref name=Leyland1899>{{cite book|last=Leyland|first =John|title=Dispatches and letters relating to the blockade of Brest, 1803\u20131805|publisher=Printed for the [[Navy Records Society]]|year=1899|isbn=|url =https://archive.org/details/dispatchesandle00leylgoog|page =xx}}</ref></blockquote></center>\n* The battle is famous for the innovative British tactic of \"breaking the line\", in which the British ships passed through a gap in the French line, engaging the enemy from leeward and throwing them into disorder.<ref name=\"O'Shaugh\"/> Historians disagree about whether the tactic was intentional or made possible by weather.

The Battle of the Saintes transferred the strategic initiative to the British. The most likely next military action would be an attack on the French sugar islands. The French were consequently inclined to ameliorate their terms. Britain's dominance at sea was reasserted. The Americans realized they were unlikely to have much French support in the future. [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Richard Howe]] gained relief of the [[Great Siege of Gibraltar|Siege of Gibraltar]] by defeating the huge Franco-Spanish assault; the siege was subsequently lifted in February 1783.<ref name=\"Mahan1\"/> Initial articles of peace were [[Peace of Paris (1783)|signed in July]], with a [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|full treaty]] following in September 1783.\n\nAs a result of the battle, British naval tactics changed. The old method involved the attacking fleet spreading itself along the entire enemy line.

R. R. Tolkien]] drew on a number of sources. Tolkien was inspired by the academic fields of [[philology]] and early [[Germanic peoples|Germanic]] literature. He was also influenced by Celtic, Finnish, Slavic, and Greek language and mythology. His fiction also reflected his Christian beliefs, his consumption of contemporary culture, and his personal experiences, including his reaction to twentieth\u2013century warfare.\n<!--need an overview here-->\n\n==Philology==\n\nTolkien was a professional [[philologist]], a scholar of comparative and historical [[linguistics]]. He was especially familiar with [[Old English]] and related languages. Tolkien stated in a letter to his American publisher [[Houghton Mifflin]] on 30 June 1955 that his earlier remark to the poet and ''[[The New York Times]]'' book reviewer [[Harvey Breit]] \"I am a philologist and all my work is philological.\" was meant to imply that his work was \"all of a piece, and ''fundamentally linguistic'' [sic] in inspiration. ... The [[Languages constructed by J. R. R. Tolkien|invention of languages]] is the foundation. The 'stories' were made rather to provide a world for the languages than the reverse.

In both, the male heroes make rash promises after having been stricken by the beauty of non-mortal maidens; both enlist the aid of great kings, [[King Arthur|Arthur]] and [[Finrod]]; both show rings that prove their identities; both are set impossible tasks that include, directly or indirectly, the hunting and killing of ferocious beasts (the wild boars, [[Twrch Trwyth]] and Ysgithrywyn, and the wolf [[Carcharoth]]) with the help of a supernatural hound (Cafall and [[Huan (Middle-earth)|Huan]]).

As an [[Admiral (United States)|admiral]] and later the 19th Chief of Naval Operations, Zumwalt played a major role in United States military history, especially during the [[Vietnam War]]. A decorated war veteran, Zumwalt reformed United States Navy personnel policies in an effort to improve enlisted life and ease racial tensions. After he retired from a 32-year navy career, he launched an unsuccessful campaign for the [[United States Senate]].\n\n==Early life and education==\nZumwalt was born in [[San Francisco, California]], the son of Elmo Russell Zumwalt, and his wife, Frances Pearl (Frank) Zumwalt, both country doctors.<ref>''Contemporary Authors Online'', Gale, 2009. Reproduced in Biography Resource Center. [[Farmington Hills, Michigan]]: Gale, 2009.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/visaliatimesdelta/obituary.aspx?pid=163784539|title=James Gregory Zumwalt |website=Legacy.com|accessdate=16 February 2019}}</ref> Frances was raised [[Jewish]], the daughter of Julius and Sarah Frank of [[Burlington, Vermont]]. Her family moved to [[Los Angeles, California]], where she grew up. She became estranged from her parents for marrying outside the faith, as the Zumwalts were Christians.<ref>{{cite book|last=Berman|first=Larry|title=Zumwalt: The Life and Times of Admiral Elmo Russell \"Bud\" Zumwalt Jr.|publisher=HarperCollins|year=2012}}</ref>\n\nZumwalt, an [[Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts of America)|Eagle Scout]] and recipient of the [[Distinguished Eagle Scout Award]] from the [[Scouting in California|Boy Scouts of America]], attended [[Tulare Union High School]] in [[Tulare, California]], where he became the [[valedictorian]], and [[Rutherford Preparatory School]] in [[Long Beach, California]].\n\n==Naval career==\n===Naval Academy and World War II===\nZumwalt had planned to become a doctor like his parents, but in 1939, he was accepted to the [[United States Naval Academy]] (USNA) at [[Annapolis, Maryland]]. As a [[midshipman]] at the USNA, he was president of the Trident Society, vice president of the Quarterdeck Society and the two-time winner of the June Week Public Speaking Contest (1940\u201341). Zumwalt also participated in intercollegiate debating and was a Company Commander (1941) and Regimental Three Striper (1942). He graduated with distinction and was [[Commissioned officer|commissioned]] as an [[ensign (rank)|ensign]] on June 19, 1942. He also received an honorary degree from [[Texas Tech]] University.\n\nZumwalt was assigned to {{USS|Phelps|DD-360|6}}, a destroyer. In August 1943, ''Phelps'' was detached for instruction in the Operational Training Command-Pacific in San Francisco. In January 1944, Zumwalt reported for duty on board {{USS|Robinson|DD-562|6}}. On this ship, he was awarded the [[Bronze Star Medal]] with [[Valor device]] for \"heroic service as Evaluator in the Combat Information Center ... in action against enemy Japanese battleships during the Battle for Leyte Gulf, October 25, 1944\".\n\nAfter the end of World War II in August 1945, Zumwalt continued to serve until December 8, 1945, as the [[prize crew]] officer of the [[Japanese gunboat Ataka|''Ataka'']], a 1,200-ton Japanese river [[gunboat]] with a crew of 200. In this capacity, he took the first American-controlled ship since the outbreak of World War II up the [[Huangpu River]] to [[Shanghai]], China. There, they helped to restore order and assisted in disarming the Japanese.\n\n===Command assignments===\nZumwalt next served as [[executive officer]] of the destroyer {{USS|Saufley|DD-465|6}}, and in March 1946, was transferred to the destroyer {{USS|Zellars|DD-777|6}}, as executive officer and navigator.\n\nIn January 1948, Zumwalt was assigned to the [[Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps]] unit of the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|University of North Carolina]], where he remained until June 1950. That same month, he assumed command of {{USS|Tills|DE-748|6}}, a destroyer escort that was commissioned in a reserve status. The ''Tills'' was placed in full active commission at [[Charleston Naval Shipyard]] on November 21, 1950, and he continued to command her until March 1951, when he joined the battleship {{USS|Wisconsin|BB-64|6}} as navigator and served with the ship in operations in Korea.\n\nDetached from USS ''Wisconsin'' in June 1952, he attended the [[Naval War College]], [[Newport, Rhode Island]], and in June 1953, he reported as head of the Shore and Overseas Bases Section, [[Bureau of Naval Personnel]], Navy Department, [[Washington, DC]]. He also served as officer and enlisted requirements officer, and as action officer on Medicare legislation. Completing that tour of duty in July 1955, he assumed command of the destroyer {{USS|Arnold J. Isbell|DD-869|6}}, participating in two deployments with the [[United States Seventh Fleet]]. In this assignment, he was commended by the Commander, Cruiser-Destroyer Forces, [[United States Pacific Fleet]], for winning the Battle Efficiency Competition for his ship and for winning Excellence Awards in Engineering, Gunnery, Anti-Submarine Warfare, and Operations. In July 1957, he returned to the Bureau of Naval Personnel for further duty. In December 1957, he was transferred to the Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Personnel and Reserve Forces), and served as special assistant for naval personnel until November 1958, then as special assistant and naval aide until August 1959.\n\nOrdered to the first ship built from the keel up as a [[guided missile frigate]], {{USS|Dewey|DLG-14|6}}, built at the [[Bath Iron Works|Bath (Maine) Iron Works]], he assumed command of that frigate at her commissioning in December 1959, and commanded it until June 1961. During the period of his command, ''Dewey'' earned the Excellence Award in Engineering, Supply, Weapons, and was runner-up in the Battle Efficiency Competition. He was a student at the [[National War College]], Washington, DC, during the 1961\u20131962 class year. In June 1962, he was assigned to the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense (International Security Affairs), Washington, DC, where he served first as desk officer for France, Spain, and Portugal, then as director of arms control and contingency planning for Cuba. From December 1963 until June 21, 1965, he served as executive assistant and senior aide to the Honorable [[Paul Nitze|Paul H. Nitze]], [[Secretary of the Navy]]. For duty in his tour in the offices of the [[Secretary of Defense]] and the Secretary of the Navy, he was awarded the [[Legion of Merit]].\n\n===Flag assignments===\n====Vietnam====\nAfter his selection for the rank of [[Rear admiral (United States)|rear admiral]], Zumwalt assumed command of Cruiser-Destroyer Flotilla Seven on 24 July 1965 in San Diego.<ref>Berman, Zumwalt, 154</ref> He then served as Director, Systems Analysis Division, OPNAV (OP-96) from August 1966 to August 1968.<ref>Berman, Zumwalt, 433.</ref> In September 1968, he became Commander [[Naval Forces Vietnam]] and Chief of the Naval Advisory Group, United States [[Military Assistance Command Vietnam]] (MACV) and was promoted to vice admiral in October 1968. Zumwalt was the Navy adviser to General [[Creighton Abrams]], Commander, MACV. Zumwalt always spoke very highly of Abrams, and said that Abrams was the most caring officer he had ever known.\n\nZumwalt's command was not a [[blue-water navy|blue-water]] force, like the Seventh Fleet; it was a [[brown-water navy|brown-water]] unit: he commanded the flotilla of [[Fast Patrol Craft|Swift Boats]] that patrolled the coasts, harbors, and rivers of Vietnam. Among the swift-boat commanders were his son, Elmo Russell Zumwalt III, and later future Senator and Secretary of State, [[John Kerry]]. Among his other forces were [[Task Force 115]], the Coastal Surveillance Force, Task Force 116, the River Patrol Force, and Task Force 117, the joint Army-Navy Mobile Riverine Force.<ref>Berman, Zumwalt, 171</ref>\n\n====Chief of Naval Operations====\nPresident [[Richard Nixon]] nominated Zumwalt to be [[Chief of Naval Operations]] in April 1970. Upon being relieved as Commander Naval Forces Vietnam on May 15, 1970, he was awarded a second [[Navy Distinguished Service Medal]] for exceptionally meritorious service.\n\nZumwalt assumed duties as Chief of Naval Operations and was promoted to full admiral on July 1, 1970, and quickly began a series of moves intended to reduce racism and sexism in the Navy. These were disseminated in Navy-wide communications known as \"Z-grams\". These included orders authorizing beards (sideburns, mustaches, and longer groomed hair were also acceptable) and introducing beer-dispensing machines to barracks. \n\nZumwalt instituted the 'Mod Squad'\u2014[[Destroyer Squadron 26]] and later 31\u2014to give promising young officers early command experience. Billets were a rank lower than normal.\n\nZumwalt reshaped the Navy's effort to replace large numbers of aging World War II-era vessels, a plan called \"High-Low\". Instituted over the resistance of Admiral [[Hyman Rickover]] and others, High-Low sought to balance the purchase of high-end, nuclear-powered vessels with low-end, cheaper ones\u2014such as the [[Sea Control Ship]]\u2014that could be bought in greater numbers. Rickover, the 'Father of the Nuclear Navy', preferred buying a few major ships to buying many ordinary ones. Zumwalt proposed four kinds of warships to fit the plan; in the end, only the {{sclass-|Pegasus|hydrofoil|4}} of missile patrol boats and the [[Oliver Hazard Perry-class frigate|''Oliver Hazard Perry'' (FFG 7) class]] of [[frigate|guided missile frigates]] became reality, and only six of the planned 100+ ''Pegasus''-class [[hydrofoil]]s were built. But the ''Oliver Hazard Perry''s stood as the most populous class of United States' warships since World War II until the advent of the [[Arleigh Burke-class destroyer|''Arleigh Burke'' (DDG 51) destroyers]]. Zumwalt was the last Chief of Naval Operations to live in [[Number One Observatory Circle]] before it became the official residence of the [[Vice President of the United States|vice president]]. For Zumwalt, not pleased with the choice, this was reason enough to challenge Virginia Senator [[Harry F. Byrd Jr.]] in the 1976 Senate election in Virginia.<ref name=\"google\">{{cite book|title=Barbara Bush: A Memoir|author=Bush, B.|date=2010|publisher=Scribner|isbn=9781451603958|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q0qdrPsi0eEC}}</ref>\n\nElmo Zumwalt Jr. retired from the Navy on July 1, 1974, aged 53.\n\n==List of Z-grams==\n\"Z-gram\" was the semi-official title for policy directives issued by Elmo Zumwalt as Chief of Naval Operations (CNO).<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.history.navy.mil/research/library/online-reading-room/title-list-alphabetically/z/z-grams-list-policy-directives-issued-admiral-zumwalt.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-04-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160123152534/http://www.history.navy.mil/research/library/online-reading-room/title-list-alphabetically/z/z-grams-list-policy-directives-issued-admiral-zumwalt.html |archive-date=2016-01-23 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Many of these directives were efforts to reform outdated policies potentially contributing to difficulties recruiting and retaining qualified naval personnel during the period of United States withdrawal from the [[Vietnam War]].\n\n{{hidden begin|border=#aaa 1px solid|titlestyle=text-align:center|title=List of Z-grams}}\n*Z-gram 1 (1 July 1970): Zumwalt's remarks upon taking office as CNO.\n*Z-gram 2 (14 July 1970): convened a junior officer retention study group.\n*Z-gram 3 (22 July 1970): Cryptographic procedures and Policy.\n*Z-gram 4 (30 July 1970): authorized 30 days leave for officers with orders for a permanent change of station (PCS).\n*Z-gram 5 (30 July 1970): instituted a test program aboard six ships to extend to [[Petty officer, first class|1st class petty officers]] the privilege of officers and [[Chief Petty Officer (United States)|chief petty officers (CPOs)]] to keep civilian clothing aboard ship for wearing on [[Shore leave|liberty]].\n*Z-gram 6 (11 August 1970): instituted a test program, funded entirely by deployed personnel to assist their families obtaining transportation and lodging to visit them in an overseas liberty port during holiday periods.\n*Z-gram 7 (11 August 1970): directed commanding officers to assign sponsors for newly arriving personnel.

It reviews his Navy career and includes reprints of all the Z-Grams he issued as CNO.\n\nAlso in [[1976 United States Senate election in Virginia|1976]], Zumwalt unsuccessfully ran as a [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic]] candidate for the [[United States Senate]] from [[Virginia]], and was defeated by incumbent independent senator [[Harry F. Byrd Jr.]] by a 57% to 38% result. Later, he held the presidency of the [[American Medical Building Corporation]] in [[Milwaukee|Milwaukee, Wisconsin]].\n\nWhile serving in Shanghai in 1945, Zumwalt met and married Mouza Coutelais-du-Roche, whose French-Russian family was living there. She returned with him to the United States. They had four children: Elmo Russell Zumwalt III; James Gregory Zumwalt; Ann F. Zumwalt Coppola; and Mouzetta C. Zumwalt-Weathers.\n\nZumwalt's eldest son, Elmo Zumwalt III, served as [[Lieutenant (junior grade)|lieutenant]] on one of Zumwalt's patrol boats during the Vietnam War. In January 1983, he was diagnosed with [[lymphoma]], and in 1985 it was discovered that he also had [[Hodgkin's disease]].<ref name=NYT>[https://www.nytimes.com/1988/08/14/obituaries/elmo-r-zumwalt-3d-42-is-dead-father-ordered-agent-orange-use.html New York Times, August 14, 1988: ''Elmo R. Zumwalt 3d, 42, Is Dead; Father Ordered Agent Orange Use''] Linked 2014-09-07</ref> In addition, his grandson Elmo Russell Zumwalt IV had been born in 1977 with severe learning disabilities. Admiral Zumwalt and his family were convinced that both son and grandson were victims of [[Agent Orange]], which the admiral had ordered to be sprayed over the Mekong Delta to kill vegetation and drive \"the Viet Cong back 1,000 yards off the water's edge\".<ref name=NYT/>\n\nIn an article published in ''[[The New York Times]]'' in 1986, Elmo Zumwalt III said:\n{{quote|I am a lawyer and I don't think I could prove in court, by the weight of the existing scientific evidence, that Agent Orange is the cause of all the medical problems \u2013 nervous disorders, cancer and skin problems \u2013 reported by Vietnam veterans, or of their children's severe birth defects. But I am convinced that it is.<ref name=NYT/>}}\n\nAdmiral Zumwalt and his son collaborated with writer [[John Pekkanen]] to create the book ''My Father, My Son'', published by MacMillan in September 1986, where they discussed the family tragedy of his son's battle with cancer. In 1988, the book was made into a TV movie with the same name, starring [[Karl Malden]] as the admiral and [[Keith Carradine]] as his son.<ref name=IMDb>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095685/combined IMDb: ''My Father, My Son (1988)''] Linked 2014-09-07</ref> Elmo Zumwalt III died from his cancer on August 14, 1988, at the age of 42,<ref name=NYT/> three months after the TV movie was shown.<ref name=IMDb/>\n\nDuring his son's illness in the early 1980s, Admiral Zumwalt was very active in lobbying Congress to establish a national registry of bone marrow donors. Such donors serve patients who do not have suitably matched bone marrow donors in their families. This was ultimately a disinterested act, since his son was able to receive a transplant from his own sister, but many patients don't have close relatives who are able and willing to help in this way. His efforts were a major factor in the founding of the [[National Marrow Donor Program]] (NMDP) in July 1986. Admiral Zumwalt was the first chairman of the NMDP's Board of Directors.\n\nIn his later years, Zumwalt resided in [[Arlington County, Virginia]].\n\n==Death and legacy==\n[[File:Defense.gov News Photo 000110-N-7495A-007.jpg|upright|thumb|left|Zumwalt's casket being carried by pallbearers at his funeral in January 2000.]]\nZumwalt died on January 2, 2000, aged 79, at the [[Duke University Medical Center]] in [[Durham, North Carolina]] from [[mesothelioma]]. Most likely, at some time in his naval career, Zumwalt was exposed to [[asbestos]], which was widely used on naval vessels until it was banned during the 1980s after its hazards became widely known. His funeral service was held at the [[Naval Academy Chapel]]. In his eulogy President Bill Clinton called Zumwalt \"the conscience of the United States Navy\".<ref name=\"ClintonEu\">{{cite web | url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=58232 | title=William J.

As an [[Admiral (United States)|admiral]] and later the 19th Chief of Naval Operations, Zumwalt played a major role in United States military history, especially during the [[Vietnam War]]. A decorated war veteran, Zumwalt reformed United States Navy personnel policies in an effort to improve enlisted life and ease racial tensions. After he retired from a 32-year navy career, he launched an unsuccessful campaign for the [[United States Senate]].\n\n==Early life and education==\nZumwalt was born in [[San Francisco, California]], the son of Elmo Russell Zumwalt, and his wife, Frances Pearl (Frank) Zumwalt, both country doctors.<ref>''Contemporary Authors Online'', Gale, 2009. Reproduced in Biography Resource Center. [[Farmington Hills, Michigan]]: Gale, 2009.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/visaliatimesdelta/obituary.aspx?pid=163784539|title=James Gregory Zumwalt |website=Legacy.com|accessdate=16 February 2019}}</ref> Frances was raised [[Jewish]], the daughter of Julius and Sarah Frank of [[Burlington, Vermont]]. Her family moved to [[Los Angeles, California]], where she grew up. She became estranged from her parents for marrying outside the faith, as the Zumwalts were Christians.<ref>{{cite book|last=Berman|first=Larry|title=Zumwalt: The Life and Times of Admiral Elmo Russell \"Bud\" Zumwalt Jr.|publisher=HarperCollins|year=2012}}</ref>\n\nZumwalt, an [[Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts of America)|Eagle Scout]] and recipient of the [[Distinguished Eagle Scout Award]] from the [[Scouting in California|Boy Scouts of America]], attended [[Tulare Union High School]] in [[Tulare, California]], where he became the [[valedictorian]], and [[Rutherford Preparatory School]] in [[Long Beach, California]].\n\n==Naval career==\n===Naval Academy and World War II===\nZumwalt had planned to become a doctor like his parents, but in 1939, he was accepted to the [[United States Naval Academy]] (USNA) at [[Annapolis, Maryland]]. As a [[midshipman]] at the USNA, he was president of the Trident Society, vice president of the Quarterdeck Society and the two-time winner of the June Week Public Speaking Contest (1940\u201341). Zumwalt also participated in intercollegiate debating and was a Company Commander (1941) and Regimental Three Striper (1942). He graduated with distinction and was [[Commissioned officer|commissioned]] as an [[ensign (rank)|ensign]] on June 19, 1942. He also received an honorary degree from [[Texas Tech]] University.\n\nZumwalt was assigned to {{USS|Phelps|DD-360|6}}, a destroyer. In August 1943, ''Phelps'' was detached for instruction in the Operational Training Command-Pacific in San Francisco. In January 1944, Zumwalt reported for duty on board {{USS|Robinson|DD-562|6}}. On this ship, he was awarded the [[Bronze Star Medal]] with [[Valor device]] for \"heroic service as Evaluator in the Combat Information Center ... in action against enemy Japanese battleships during the Battle for Leyte Gulf, October 25, 1944\".\n\nAfter the end of World War II in August 1945, Zumwalt continued to serve until December 8, 1945, as the [[prize crew]] officer of the [[Japanese gunboat Ataka|''Ataka'']], a 1,200-ton Japanese river [[gunboat]] with a crew of 200. In this capacity, he took the first American-controlled ship since the outbreak of World War II up the [[Huangpu River]] to [[Shanghai]], China. There, they helped to restore order and assisted in disarming the Japanese.\n\n===Command assignments===\nZumwalt next served as [[executive officer]] of the destroyer {{USS|Saufley|DD-465|6}}, and in March 1946, was transferred to the destroyer {{USS|Zellars|DD-777|6}}, as executive officer and navigator.\n\nIn January 1948, Zumwalt was assigned to the [[Naval Reserve Officers Training Corps]] unit of the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill|University of North Carolina]], where he remained until June 1950. That same month, he assumed command of {{USS|Tills|DE-748|6}}, a destroyer escort that was commissioned in a reserve status. The ''Tills'' was placed in full active commission at [[Charleston Naval Shipyard]] on November 21, 1950, and he continued to command her until March 1951, when he joined the battleship {{USS|Wisconsin|BB-64|6}} as navigator and served with the ship in operations in Korea.\n\nDetached from USS ''Wisconsin'' in June 1952, he attended the [[Naval War College]], [[Newport, Rhode Island]], and in June 1953, he reported as head of the Shore and Overseas Bases Section, [[Bureau of Naval Personnel]], Navy Department, [[Washington, DC]]. He also served as officer and enlisted requirements officer, and as action officer on Medicare legislation. Completing that tour of duty in July 1955, he assumed command of the destroyer {{USS|Arnold J. Isbell|DD-869|6}}, participating in two deployments with the [[United States Seventh Fleet]]. In this assignment, he was commended by the Commander, Cruiser-Destroyer Forces, [[United States Pacific Fleet]], for winning the Battle Efficiency Competition for his ship and for winning Excellence Awards in Engineering, Gunnery, Anti-Submarine Warfare, and Operations. In July 1957, he returned to the Bureau of Naval Personnel for further duty. In December 1957, he was transferred to the Office of the Assistant Secretary of the Navy (Personnel and Reserve Forces), and served as special assistant for naval personnel until November 1958, then as special assistant and naval aide until August 1959.\n\nOrdered to the first ship built from the keel up as a [[guided missile frigate]], {{USS|Dewey|DLG-14|6}}, built at the [[Bath Iron Works|Bath (Maine) Iron Works]], he assumed command of that frigate at her commissioning in December 1959, and commanded it until June 1961. During the period of his command, ''Dewey'' earned the Excellence Award in Engineering, Supply, Weapons, and was runner-up in the Battle Efficiency Competition. He was a student at the [[National War College]], Washington, DC, during the 1961\u20131962 class year. In June 1962, he was assigned to the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense (International Security Affairs), Washington, DC, where he served first as desk officer for France, Spain, and Portugal, then as director of arms control and contingency planning for Cuba. From December 1963 until June 21, 1965, he served as executive assistant and senior aide to the Honorable [[Paul Nitze|Paul H. Nitze]], [[Secretary of the Navy]]. For duty in his tour in the offices of the [[Secretary of Defense]] and the Secretary of the Navy, he was awarded the [[Legion of Merit]].\n\n===Flag assignments===\n====Vietnam====\nAfter his selection for the rank of [[Rear admiral (United States)|rear admiral]], Zumwalt assumed command of Cruiser-Destroyer Flotilla Seven on 24 July 1965 in San Diego.<ref>Berman, Zumwalt, 154</ref> He then served as Director, Systems Analysis Division, OPNAV (OP-96) from August 1966 to August 1968.<ref>Berman, Zumwalt, 433.</ref> In September 1968, he became Commander [[Naval Forces Vietnam]] and Chief of the Naval Advisory Group, United States [[Military Assistance Command Vietnam]] (MACV) and was promoted to vice admiral in October 1968. Zumwalt was the Navy adviser to General [[Creighton Abrams]], Commander, MACV. Zumwalt always spoke very highly of Abrams, and said that Abrams was the most caring officer he had ever known.\n\nZumwalt's command was not a [[blue-water navy|blue-water]] force, like the Seventh Fleet; it was a [[brown-water navy|brown-water]] unit: he commanded the flotilla of [[Fast Patrol Craft|Swift Boats]] that patrolled the coasts, harbors, and rivers of Vietnam. Among the swift-boat commanders were his son, Elmo Russell Zumwalt III, and later future Senator and Secretary of State, [[John Kerry]]. Among his other forces were [[Task Force 115]], the Coastal Surveillance Force, Task Force 116, the River Patrol Force, and Task Force 117, the joint Army-Navy Mobile Riverine Force.<ref>Berman, Zumwalt, 171</ref>\n\n====Chief of Naval Operations====\nPresident [[Richard Nixon]] nominated Zumwalt to be [[Chief of Naval Operations]] in April 1970. Upon being relieved as Commander Naval Forces Vietnam on May 15, 1970, he was awarded a second [[Navy Distinguished Service Medal]] for exceptionally meritorious service.\n\nZumwalt assumed duties as Chief of Naval Operations and was promoted to full admiral on July 1, 1970, and quickly began a series of moves intended to reduce racism and sexism in the Navy. These were disseminated in Navy-wide communications known as \"Z-grams\". These included orders authorizing beards (sideburns, mustaches, and longer groomed hair were also acceptable) and introducing beer-dispensing machines to barracks. \n\nZumwalt instituted the 'Mod Squad'\u2014[[Destroyer Squadron 26]] and later 31\u2014to give promising young officers early command experience. Billets were a rank lower than normal.\n\nZumwalt reshaped the Navy's effort to replace large numbers of aging World War II-era vessels, a plan called \"High-Low\". Instituted over the resistance of Admiral [[Hyman Rickover]] and others, High-Low sought to balance the purchase of high-end, nuclear-powered vessels with low-end, cheaper ones\u2014such as the [[Sea Control Ship]]\u2014that could be bought in greater numbers. Rickover, the 'Father of the Nuclear Navy', preferred buying a few major ships to buying many ordinary ones. Zumwalt proposed four kinds of warships to fit the plan; in the end, only the {{sclass-|Pegasus|hydrofoil|4}} of missile patrol boats and the [[Oliver Hazard Perry-class frigate|''Oliver Hazard Perry'' (FFG 7) class]] of [[frigate|guided missile frigates]] became reality, and only six of the planned 100+ ''Pegasus''-class [[hydrofoil]]s were built. But the ''Oliver Hazard Perry''s stood as the most populous class of United States' warships since World War II until the advent of the [[Arleigh Burke-class destroyer|''Arleigh Burke'' (DDG 51) destroyers]]. Zumwalt was the last Chief of Naval Operations to live in [[Number One Observatory Circle]] before it became the official residence of the [[Vice President of the United States|vice president]]. For Zumwalt, not pleased with the choice, this was reason enough to challenge Virginia Senator [[Harry F. Byrd Jr.]] in the 1976 Senate election in Virginia.<ref name=\"google\">{{cite book|title=Barbara Bush: A Memoir|author=Bush, B.|date=2010|publisher=Scribner|isbn=9781451603958|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q0qdrPsi0eEC}}</ref>\n\nElmo Zumwalt Jr. retired from the Navy on July 1, 1974, aged 53.\n\n==List of Z-grams==\n\"Z-gram\" was the semi-official title for policy directives issued by Elmo Zumwalt as Chief of Naval Operations (CNO).<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.history.navy.mil/research/library/online-reading-room/title-list-alphabetically/z/z-grams-list-policy-directives-issued-admiral-zumwalt.html |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-04-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160123152534/http://www.history.navy.mil/research/library/online-reading-room/title-list-alphabetically/z/z-grams-list-policy-directives-issued-admiral-zumwalt.html |archive-date=2016-01-23 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Many of these directives were efforts to reform outdated policies potentially contributing to difficulties recruiting and retaining qualified naval personnel during the period of United States withdrawal from the [[Vietnam War]].\n\n{{hidden begin|border=#aaa 1px solid|titlestyle=text-align:center|title=List of Z-grams}}\n*Z-gram 1 (1 July 1970): Zumwalt's remarks upon taking office as CNO.\n*Z-gram 2 (14 July 1970): convened a junior officer retention study group.\n*Z-gram 3 (22 July 1970): Cryptographic procedures and Policy.\n*Z-gram 4 (30 July 1970): authorized 30 days leave for officers with orders for a permanent change of station (PCS).\n*Z-gram 5 (30 July 1970): instituted a test program aboard six ships to extend to [[Petty officer, first class|1st class petty officers]] the privilege of officers and [[Chief Petty Officer (United States)|chief petty officers (CPOs)]] to keep civilian clothing aboard ship for wearing on [[Shore leave|liberty]].\n*Z-gram 6 (11 August 1970): instituted a test program, funded entirely by deployed personnel to assist their families obtaining transportation and lodging to visit them in an overseas liberty port during holiday periods.\n*Z-gram 7 (11 August 1970): directed commanding officers to assign sponsors for newly arriving personnel.

Admiral Zumwalt and his family were convinced that both son and grandson were victims of [[Agent Orange]], which the admiral had ordered to be sprayed over the Mekong Delta to kill vegetation and drive \"the Viet Cong back 1,000 yards off the water's edge\".<ref name=NYT/>\n\nIn an article published in ''[[The New York Times]]'' in 1986, Elmo Zumwalt III said:\n{{quote|I am a lawyer and I don't think I could prove in court, by the weight of the existing scientific evidence, that Agent Orange is the cause of all the medical problems \u2013 nervous disorders, cancer and skin problems \u2013 reported by Vietnam veterans, or of their children's severe birth defects. But I am convinced that it is.<ref name=NYT/>}}\n\nAdmiral Zumwalt and his son collaborated with writer [[John Pekkanen]] to create the book ''My Father, My Son'', published by MacMillan in September 1986, where they discussed the family tragedy of his son's battle with cancer. In 1988, the book was made into a TV movie with the same name, starring [[Karl Malden]] as the admiral and [[Keith Carradine]] as his son.<ref name=IMDb>[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0095685/combined IMDb: ''My Father, My Son (1988)''] Linked 2014-09-07</ref> Elmo Zumwalt III died from his cancer on August 14, 1988, at the age of 42,<ref name=NYT/> three months after the TV movie was shown.<ref name=IMDb/>\n\nDuring his son's illness in the early 1980s, Admiral Zumwalt was very active in lobbying Congress to establish a national registry of bone marrow donors. Such donors serve patients who do not have suitably matched bone marrow donors in their families. This was ultimately a disinterested act, since his son was able to receive a transplant from his own sister, but many patients don't have close relatives who are able and willing to help in this way. His efforts were a major factor in the founding of the [[National Marrow Donor Program]] (NMDP) in July 1986. Admiral Zumwalt was the first chairman of the NMDP's Board of Directors.\n\nIn his later years, Zumwalt resided in [[Arlington County, Virginia]].\n\n==Death and legacy==\n[[File:Defense.gov News Photo 000110-N-7495A-007.jpg|upright|thumb|left|Zumwalt's casket being carried by pallbearers at his funeral in January 2000.]]\nZumwalt died on January 2, 2000, aged 79, at the [[Duke University Medical Center]] in [[Durham, North Carolina]] from [[mesothelioma]]. Most likely, at some time in his naval career, Zumwalt was exposed to [[asbestos]], which was widely used on naval vessels until it was banned during the 1980s after its hazards became widely known. His funeral service was held at the [[Naval Academy Chapel]]. In his eulogy President Bill Clinton called Zumwalt \"the conscience of the United States Navy\".<ref name=\"ClintonEu\">{{cite web | url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=58232 | title=William J.
