The contest was held when it was determined that using one of the five communities' names would be too controversial.<ref name=\"LCCVB\">{{cite web|last1=Hall|first1=Anne|last2=North Lincoln County Historical Museum|title=Lincoln City History|work=About Lincoln City|publisher=Lincoln City Visitor and Convention Bureau|url=http://www.oregoncoast.org/pages/about-lc.html|accessdate=October 6, 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061230175946/http://www.oregoncoast.org/pages/about-lc.html|archivedate=December 30, 2006}}</ref>\n\n===Former communities===\n\n====Cutler City====\nCutler City is located on the east shore of [[Siletz Bay]].

These were adjacent communities along [[U.S. Route 101]], which serves as Lincoln City's main street. The name \"Lincoln City\" was chosen from contest entries submitted by local school children. The contest was held when it was determined that using one of the five communities' names would be too controversial.<ref name=\"LCCVB\">{{cite web|last1=Hall|first1=Anne|last2=North Lincoln County Historical Museum|title=Lincoln City History|work=About Lincoln City|publisher=Lincoln City Visitor and Convention Bureau|url=http://www.oregoncoast.org/pages/about-lc.html|accessdate=October 6, 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061230175946/http://www.oregoncoast.org/pages/about-lc.html|archivedate=December 30, 2006}}</ref>\n\n===Former communities===\n\n====Cutler City====\nCutler City is located on the east shore of [[Siletz Bay]].

It is known from [[Fossil|fossils]] collected in the [[Gres superieurs Formation|Gr\u00e8s sup\u00e9rieurs Formation]] of the [[Savannakhet Basin]], the first of which were found in 2010, and comprised a partial skeleton without the skull or limbs. This specimen became the [[holotype]] of the new genus and [[species]] '''''Ichthyovenator laosensis''''', and was described by French [[palaeontologist]] Ronan Allain and colleagues in [[2012 in archosaur paleontology|2012]]. The generic name, meaning \"fish hunter\", refers to its assumed [[piscivorous]] lifestyle, while the specific name alludes to the country of Laos. In 2014, it was announced that further remains from the dig site had been recovered, these fossils included teeth as well as more [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#vertebrae|vertebrae]] (backbones) and a [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#pubis|pubic bone]] from the same individual.\n\nThe holotype specimen is estimated to have been {{convert|8.5 and 10.5|m|ft|sp=|abbr=}} long and weighed {{convert|2 to 2.4|t|short ton|abbr=}}. ''Ichthyovenator''<nowiki/>'s teeth were straight and conical, and its neck resembled that of the closely related ''[[Sigilmassasaurus]]''. Like others in its family, ''Ichthyovenator'' had tall [[neural spines]] forming a [[Neural spine sail|sail]] on its back. Unusually among all other known spinosaurids, ''Ichthyovenator''<nowiki/>'s sail had a [[sinusoidal]] (wave-like) shape, curving downwards over the hips into two separate sails. The [[pelvic girdle]] was reduced, with the length ratio between the main body of the [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#pelvis|pelvis]] and the pubes and ischia being higher than in any other known theropod dinosaurs. The animal was initially thought to belong to the [[Baryonychinae]] [[subfamily]], but more recent analyses place it as a primitive member in the [[Spinosaurinae]].\n\nAs a spinosaur, ''Ichthyovenator'' would have had a long, shallow snout and robust forelimbs. Its diet likely consisted mainly of aquatic prey (hence its etymology). Spinosaurids are also known to have eaten small dinosaurs and [[Pterosaur|pterosaurs]] in addition to fish. ''Ichthyovenator''<nowiki/>'s conspicuous sail might have been used for [[sexual display]] or [[species recognition]]. Fossil evidence suggests that spinosaurids, especially spinosaurines, were adapted for [[semiaquatic]] lifestyles. The vertebral spines of ''Ichthyovenator''<nowiki/>'s tail were unusually tall, suggesting that\u2014like in today's [[Crocodilia|crocodilians]]\u2014the tail may have aided in swimming. ''Ichthyovenator'' lived alongside [[Sauropoda|sauropod]] and [[Ornithopoda|ornithopod]] dinosaurs, as well as [[Bivalvia|bivalves]], fish and turtles.\n\n==Discovery and naming==\n[[File:Ichthyovenator_skeletal_%26_size_comparison_by_PaleoGeek.png|thumb|left|alt=Drawing of fossil rib, backbones and pelvis superimposed on silhouette of a dinosaur|Skeletal diagram with [[holotype]] elements in place, excluding the additional [[fossil]] material announced in 2014]]\n\nThe first [[fossil|fossils]] of ''Ichthyovenator'' were found in 2010 at [[Ban Kalum]], in the [[Gres superieurs Formation|Gr\u00e8s sup\u00e9rieurs Formation]] of the [[Savannakhet Basin]] in [[Savannakhet Province]], Laos. These bones were recovered from a [[red sandstone]] layer, within a surface area of less than {{convert|2|m|ft|sp=|abbr=}} squared. Designated under the specimen number MDS BK10-01 \u2014 15, it consists of a partly [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#articulation|articulated]], well preserved skeleton lacking the skull and limbs, and including the third to last [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#dorsals|dorsal]] (back) [[vertebra]], the [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#neural spine|neural spine]] of the last dorsal vertebra, five partial [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#sacrals|sacral]] (hip) vertebrae, the first two [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#caudals|caudal]] (tail) vertebrae, both [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#ilium|ilia]] (main hip bone), a right [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#pubis|pubis]] (pubic bone), both [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#ischium|ischia]] (lower and rearmost hip bones) and a posterior dorsal [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#ribs|rib]].

They also bore robust front [[Tubercle (bone)|tubercles]] (processes for [[skeletal muscle]] attachment) and lacked inter[[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#zygapophyseal laminae|zygapophyseal laminae]], which resulted in their spinopre- and spinopostzygapophyseal [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#fossae|fossae]] (depressions) having open undersides. The first dorsal vertebra had extensive [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#transverse processes|transverse processes]] (wing-like projections that articulate with the ribs), as well as deep air pockets at the front and back of its base. The [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#parapophyses|parapophysis]] (a process that articulated with the [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#capitulum|capitulum]] of the ribs) of the first dorsal increased in height from the top and bottom, with its underside remaining in contact with the front lower edge of the centrum, this is unlike the condition in most theropods, where the parapophyses shifted towards the top of the vertebra during the transition from cervical to dorsal vertebrae. All of these features were also present in the African spinosaurid ''[[Sigilmassasaurus]]''. ''Ichthyovenator''<nowiki/>'s mid-cervical vertebrae all had elongate, somewhat wider than tall centra that became progressively shorter towards the rear of the neck, as well as well-developed keels on their bottom surfaces, traits all shared with the spinosaurids ''[[Baryonyx]], [[Suchomimus]]'', ''Sigilmassasaurus'',<ref name=\":1\" /> and ''[[Vallibonavenatrix]]''.<ref name=\":3\">Elisabete Malafaia; Jos\u00e9 Miguel Gasulla; Fernando Escaso; Iv\u00e1n Narv\u00e1ez; Jos\u00e9 Luis Sanz; Francisco Ortega (2019). \"A new spinosaurid theropod (Dinosauria: Megalosauroidea) from the late Barremian of Vallibona, Spain: Implications for spinosaurid diversity in the Early Cretaceous of the Iberian Peninsula\".

The rib shaft was strongly curved, forming a half circle. The lower end of the rib was slightly expanded both sideways and to the front and back. This condition, which differs from the tapered, pointed tips seen in the ribs of other known theropods, suggests that the rearmost dorsal ribs articulated with the complex of the [[sternum]] (breast bone).<ref name=\"AXRK12\" />\n\n[[File:Ichthyovenator_laosensis_65849.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|alt=Cast fossil spinal column laid out inside a glass display case at a museum|Casts of the [[Vertebra|vertebrae]] at the [[Mus\u00e9um national d'histoire naturelle|Mus\u00e9um National d'Histoire Naturelle]], Paris|alt=|left]]\n\nLike many other spinosaurids, ''Ichthyovenator'' had a [[Neural spine sail|sail]] on its back and hip, formed by the elongated [[neural spines]] of its vertebrae. Uniquely among known members of the family however, ''Ichthyovenator''<nowiki/>'s sail was divided in two over the hip, and had a [[sinusoid]] (wave-like) curvature. This is in contrast to the related genera ''[[Spinosaurus]]'' and ''Suchomimus'' (both of which had continuous sails that rose to a peak before sloping down again), and B''aryonyx'' (which showed a less developed sail, having much lower dorsal spines). ''Ichthyovenator''<nowiki/>'s preserved dorsal and sacral [[spinal column]], over {{Convert|1|m||abbr=}} long, shows a very high spine on the twelfth dorsal vertebra, representing a crest that rose from the back, and a lower rounded sail that extended from the sacral vertebrae of the hip, with its highest point above the third and fourth sacrals. The {{Convert|54.6|cm||adj=on}} high spine of the twelfth dorsal vertebra widened towards the top, giving it a [[Trapezoid|trapezoidal]] shape, whereas the spines of other spinosaurids were roughly rectangular. It also lacked the forward or backward inclination of ''Spinosaurus''<nowiki/>'s neural spines. Its front corner formed a {{Convert|3|cm||adj=on}} narrow process, pointing upwards. The spine of the thirteenth dorsal vertebra has only been partly preserved, its upper and lower ends having broken off. From its general shape the describers inferred however, that it was about as long as the preceding spine. This would imply that the back edge of the front sail would form a rectangular corner, as the spine of the first sacral vertebra is with about {{Convert|21|cm|}} much lower, creating a sudden hiatus in the profile of the sail. The spine of the second sacral vertebra steeply curved upwards again, joining the {{Convert|39|cm||adj=on|abbr=}} and {{Convert|48|cm||adj=on}} high broad fan-shaped spines of the third and fourth sacrals. The {{Convert|40|cm||adj=on|abbr=}} tall spine of the fifth sacral gradually descended. Unlike in most other theropods, including the sail of ''Suchomimus'', the sacral spines were not fused, nor did they have any extensive contacts. The second and third sacral centra were [[co-ossified]] (fused), with the [[Suture (anatomy)|suture]] connecting them still visible. Since only the rearmost two dorsal vertebrae are preserved, it is unknown how far the dorsal sail continued towards the front of the animal's back.<ref name=\"AXRK12\" />\n\n[[File:Ichthyovenator_laosensis_by_PaleoGeek.jpg|thumb|alt=Colour life reconstruction of a left-facing spinosaur|Speculative life [[Paleoart|restoration]], with unknown regions such as the head and limbs based on relatives]]\n\nThe sacral sail was continued by the spines of the first two caudal vertebrae, which were {{Convert|28.4|cm||adj=|abbr=}} and {{Convert|25.7|cm||adj=|abbr=}} tall respectively. They leaned backwards at a 30 degree angle, and had smooth front and rear edges. The centra of the first two caudals were much broader than long and [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#amphicoelous|amphicoelous]] (deeply concave on both ends). The caudal transverse processes were prominent, sturdy, and angled upwards towards the rear of the vertebrae. The transverse processes of the first caudal vertebra, when seen from above, had a [[Sigmoid function|sigmoid]] (or S-shaped) profile. The prespinal and postspinal fossae (bony depressions in front and behind the neural spines) were confined only to above the base of the neural spines. The sides of the first caudal were also deeply hollowed out between the [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#Prezygapophyses|prezygapophyses]] (articular surfaces with the neural arch of the preceding vertebra) and the [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#diapophyses|diapophyses]] (processes on the sides for rib articulation), a condition not observed in other theropods.<ref name=\"AXRK12\" /> Some of the caudal vertebrae also had unusually tall, forwardly-extended prezygapophyses.<ref name=\":1\" /> \n\nThe {{Convert|92|cm||adj=on|abbr=}} ilium of the [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#pelvis|pelvis]] was blade-like, and longer compared to the pubic bone, which was {{Convert|65|cm||adj=|abbr=}} long, than in any other known large theropod. The [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#postacetabular process|postacetabular ala]] (front expansion) was much longer than the [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#preacetabular process|preacetabular ala]] (rear expansion), the latter had a shelf on its central surface, which formed the middle edge of the preacetabular fossa. Viewed distally (away from the centre of attachment), the lower end of the pubis had L-shape, resembling that of ''Baryonyx''. The [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#pubic apron|pubic apron]] (expanded lower end of the pubis) features a large [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#pubic foramen|pubic foramen]]. On the hind rim of the pubic bone, two openings, the [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#obturator%20foramen|obturator foramen]] and a lower fenestra, were not fully closed, making them into notches. The ischium was {{Convert|49.6|cm||adj=|abbr=}} long, making it shorter in relation to the pubis than in all other known [[Tetanurae|tetanuran]] theropods. Its main body was large and extensive, atypical of the Y-shaped upper ischia of other tetanurans, and bore an oval-shaped obturator foramen in its side. The shaft of the ischium was flattened sideways, and had an unexpanded [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#ischiadic apron|ischiadic apron]] (as in ''[[Monolophosaurus]]'' and ''[[Sinraptor]]'').<ref name=\"AXRK12\" /> The ischium attached to the illium via a peg-and-socket-like articulation, unlike the flat and concave condition seen in ''Baryonyx''.

The describers established the following [[autapomorphies]] (unique derived traits) in ''Ichthyovenator'': its dorsal and sacral sinusoidal sail; the thirteenth dorsal neural spine being 410% the length of the centrum, and having a distinct finger-shaped [[Process (anatomy)|process]] on its front upper corner; the broad, expanded tips of the third and fourth sacral spines; the first caudal vertebra's deep prezygapophyseal centrodiapophyseal fossae and S-shaped transverse processes in top view; and the lengthy illium, with its accompanying pubis being comparatively shorter to it than in any other known theropod. Allain and colleagues also identified some anatomical features unique among tetanuran theropods, including the rearmost dorsal ribs articulating with the sternal complex, the pubis's main body having obturator and pubic openings, and the ischium having a foramen on its upper end, as well as a shaft that was flatenned sideways. The shrinking of the pubis and ischium relative to the pelvis has been observed in basal [[Coelurosauria|coelurosaurs]] and [[Allosauroidea|allosauroids]], which the describers attributed to [[mosaic evolution]], the evolution of certain anatomical traits at different times in separate species.<ref name=\"AXRK12\" /> \n\n[[File:Spinosauridae_\"Sails\"_Comparison_by_PaleoGeek.png|thumb|upright=1.3|alt=Three pairs of illustrated fossil pelvic bones and spinal columns compared to the silhouette of a human to their left, Ichthyovenator's pelvis and vertebrae first from the bottom|Comparison of the [[pelvic region]] and [[Neural spine sail|neural spine sails]] of ''[[Suchomimus]]'', ''[[Spinosaurus]]'', and ''Ichthyovenator'']]\n\nIn 2014, Allain's abstract instead found that ''Ichthyovenator'' was part of the subfamily [[Spinosaurinae]], due to the lack of serrations on its teeth and possession of vertebrae with some similarities to those of ''Sigilmassasaurus''.<ref name=\":0\" /> In 2015, a [[Phylogenetics|phylogenetic]] analysis by Evers and colleagues suggested that given the apparent presence of both baryonychine and spinosaurine characteristics in ''Ichthyovenator'', the distinction between the two subfamilies may not be as clear as previously thought.<ref name=\":1\" /> Mortimer hypothesized in 2017 that ''Ichthyovenator'' may not have been a spinosaurid at all, instead possibly being a sail-backed [[Carcharodontosauridae|carcharodontosaurid]] dinosaur closely related to ''[[Concavenator]]''.

It is known from [[Fossil|fossils]] collected in the [[Gres superieurs Formation|Gr\u00e8s sup\u00e9rieurs Formation]] of the [[Savannakhet Basin]], the first of which were found in 2010, and comprised a partial skeleton without the skull or limbs. This specimen became the [[holotype]] of the new genus and [[species]] '''''Ichthyovenator laosensis''''', and was described by French [[palaeontologist]] Ronan Allain and colleagues in [[2012 in archosaur paleontology|2012]]. The generic name, meaning \"fish hunter\", refers to its assumed [[piscivorous]] lifestyle, while the specific name alludes to the country of Laos. In 2014, it was announced that further remains from the dig site had been recovered, these fossils included teeth as well as more [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#vertebrae|vertebrae]] (backbones) and a [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#pubis|pubic bone]] from the same individual.\n\nThe holotype specimen is estimated to have been {{convert|8.5 and 10.5|m|ft|sp=|abbr=}} long and weighed {{convert|2 to 2.4|t|short ton|abbr=}}. ''Ichthyovenator''<nowiki/>'s teeth were straight and conical, and its neck resembled that of the closely related ''[[Sigilmassasaurus]]''. Like others in its family, ''Ichthyovenator'' had tall [[neural spines]] forming a [[Neural spine sail|sail]] on its back. Unusually among all other known spinosaurids, ''Ichthyovenator''<nowiki/>'s sail had a [[sinusoidal]] (wave-like) shape, curving downwards over the hips into two separate sails. The [[pelvic girdle]] was reduced, with the length ratio between the main body of the [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#pelvis|pelvis]] and the pubes and ischia being higher than in any other known theropod dinosaurs. The animal was initially thought to belong to the [[Baryonychinae]] [[subfamily]], but more recent analyses place it as a primitive member in the [[Spinosaurinae]].\n\nAs a spinosaur, ''Ichthyovenator'' would have had a long, shallow snout and robust forelimbs. Its diet likely consisted mainly of aquatic prey (hence its etymology). Spinosaurids are also known to have eaten small dinosaurs and [[Pterosaur|pterosaurs]] in addition to fish. ''Ichthyovenator''<nowiki/>'s conspicuous sail might have been used for [[sexual display]] or [[species recognition]]. Fossil evidence suggests that spinosaurids, especially spinosaurines, were adapted for [[semiaquatic]] lifestyles. The vertebral spines of ''Ichthyovenator''<nowiki/>'s tail were unusually tall, suggesting that\u2014like in today's [[Crocodilia|crocodilians]]\u2014the tail may have aided in swimming. ''Ichthyovenator'' lived alongside [[Sauropoda|sauropod]] and [[Ornithopoda|ornithopod]] dinosaurs, as well as [[Bivalvia|bivalves]], fish and turtles.\n\n==Discovery and naming==\n[[File:Ichthyovenator_skeletal_%26_size_comparison_by_PaleoGeek.png|thumb|left|alt=Drawing of fossil rib, backbones and pelvis superimposed on silhouette of a dinosaur|Skeletal diagram with [[holotype]] elements in place, excluding the additional [[fossil]] material announced in 2014]]\n\nThe first [[fossil|fossils]] of ''Ichthyovenator'' were found in 2010 at [[Ban Kalum]], in the [[Gres superieurs Formation|Gr\u00e8s sup\u00e9rieurs Formation]] of the [[Savannakhet Basin]] in [[Savannakhet Province]], Laos.

The first dorsal vertebra had extensive [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#transverse processes|transverse processes]] (wing-like projections that articulate with the ribs), as well as deep air pockets at the front and back of its base. The [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#parapophyses|parapophysis]] (a process that articulated with the [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#capitulum|capitulum]] of the ribs) of the first dorsal increased in height from the top and bottom, with its underside remaining in contact with the front lower edge of the centrum, this is unlike the condition in most theropods, where the parapophyses shifted towards the top of the vertebra during the transition from cervical to dorsal vertebrae. All of these features were also present in the African spinosaurid ''[[Sigilmassasaurus]]''.

This condition, which differs from the tapered, pointed tips seen in the ribs of other known theropods, suggests that the rearmost dorsal ribs articulated with the complex of the [[sternum]] (breast bone).<ref name=\"AXRK12\" />\n\n[[File:Ichthyovenator_laosensis_65849.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|alt=Cast fossil spinal column laid out inside a glass display case at a museum|Casts of the [[Vertebra|vertebrae]] at the [[Mus\u00e9um national d'histoire naturelle|Mus\u00e9um National d'Histoire Naturelle]], Paris|alt=|left]]\n\nLike many other spinosaurids, ''Ichthyovenator'' had a [[Neural spine sail|sail]] on its back and hip, formed by the elongated [[neural spines]] of its vertebrae. Uniquely among known members of the family however, ''Ichthyovenator''<nowiki/>'s sail was divided in two over the hip, and had a [[sinusoid]] (wave-like) curvature. This is in contrast to the related genera ''[[Spinosaurus]]'' and ''Suchomimus'' (both of which had continuous sails that rose to a peak before sloping down again), and B''aryonyx'' (which showed a less developed sail, having much lower dorsal spines). ''Ichthyovenator''<nowiki/>'s preserved dorsal and sacral [[spinal column]], over {{Convert|1|m||abbr=}} long, shows a very high spine on the twelfth dorsal vertebra, representing a crest that rose from the back, and a lower rounded sail that extended from the sacral vertebrae of the hip, with its highest point above the third and fourth sacrals. The {{Convert|54.6|cm||adj=on}} high spine of the twelfth dorsal vertebra widened towards the top, giving it a [[Trapezoid|trapezoidal]] shape, whereas the spines of other spinosaurids were roughly rectangular. It also lacked the forward or backward inclination of ''Spinosaurus''<nowiki/>'s neural spines. Its front corner formed a {{Convert|3|cm||adj=on}} narrow process, pointing upwards. The spine of the thirteenth dorsal vertebra has only been partly preserved, its upper and lower ends having broken off. From its general shape the describers inferred however, that it was about as long as the preceding spine. This would imply that the back edge of the front sail would form a rectangular corner, as the spine of the first sacral vertebra is with about {{Convert|21|cm|}} much lower, creating a sudden hiatus in the profile of the sail. The spine of the second sacral vertebra steeply curved upwards again, joining the {{Convert|39|cm||adj=on|abbr=}} and {{Convert|48|cm||adj=on}} high broad fan-shaped spines of the third and fourth sacrals. The {{Convert|40|cm||adj=on|abbr=}} tall spine of the fifth sacral gradually descended. Unlike in most other theropods, including the sail of ''Suchomimus'', the sacral spines were not fused, nor did they have any extensive contacts. The second and third sacral centra were [[co-ossified]] (fused), with the [[Suture (anatomy)|suture]] connecting them still visible. Since only the rearmost two dorsal vertebrae are preserved, it is unknown how far the dorsal sail continued towards the front of the animal's back.<ref name=\"AXRK12\" />\n\n[[File:Ichthyovenator_laosensis_by_PaleoGeek.jpg|thumb|alt=Colour life reconstruction of a left-facing spinosaur|Speculative life [[Paleoart|restoration]], with unknown regions such as the head and limbs based on relatives]]\n\nThe sacral sail was continued by the spines of the first two caudal vertebrae, which were {{Convert|28.4|cm||adj=|abbr=}} and {{Convert|25.7|cm||adj=|abbr=}} tall respectively. They leaned backwards at a 30 degree angle, and had smooth front and rear edges. The centra of the first two caudals were much broader than long and [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#amphicoelous|amphicoelous]] (deeply concave on both ends). The caudal transverse processes were prominent, sturdy, and angled upwards towards the rear of the vertebrae. The transverse processes of the first caudal vertebra, when seen from above, had a [[Sigmoid function|sigmoid]] (or S-shaped) profile. The prespinal and postspinal fossae (bony depressions in front and behind the neural spines) were confined only to above the base of the neural spines. The sides of the first caudal were also deeply hollowed out between the [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#Prezygapophyses|prezygapophyses]] (articular surfaces with the neural arch of the preceding vertebra) and the [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#diapophyses|diapophyses]] (processes on the sides for rib articulation), a condition not observed in other theropods.<ref name=\"AXRK12\" /> Some of the caudal vertebrae also had unusually tall, forwardly-extended prezygapophyses.<ref name=\":1\" /> \n\nThe {{Convert|92|cm||adj=on|abbr=}} ilium of the [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#pelvis|pelvis]] was blade-like, and longer compared to the pubic bone, which was {{Convert|65|cm||adj=|abbr=}} long, than in any other known large theropod. The [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#postacetabular process|postacetabular ala]] (front expansion) was much longer than the [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#preacetabular process|preacetabular ala]] (rear expansion), the latter had a shelf on its central surface, which formed the middle edge of the preacetabular fossa. Viewed distally (away from the centre of attachment), the lower end of the pubis had L-shape, resembling that of ''Baryonyx''. The [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#pubic apron|pubic apron]] (expanded lower end of the pubis) features a large [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#pubic foramen|pubic foramen]]. On the hind rim of the pubic bone, two openings, the [[Glossary of dinosaur anatomy#obturator%20foramen|obturator foramen]] and a lower fenestra, were not fully closed, making them into notches.

The describers established the following [[autapomorphies]] (unique derived traits) in ''Ichthyovenator'': its dorsal and sacral sinusoidal sail; the thirteenth dorsal neural spine being 410% the length of the centrum, and having a distinct finger-shaped [[Process (anatomy)|process]] on its front upper corner; the broad, expanded tips of the third and fourth sacral spines; the first caudal vertebra's deep prezygapophyseal centrodiapophyseal fossae and S-shaped transverse processes in top view; and the lengthy illium, with its accompanying pubis being comparatively shorter to it than in any other known theropod. Allain and colleagues also identified some anatomical features unique among tetanuran theropods, including the rearmost dorsal ribs articulating with the sternal complex, the pubis's main body having obturator and pubic openings, and the ischium having a foramen on its upper end, as well as a shaft that was flatenned sideways. The shrinking of the pubis and ischium relative to the pelvis has been observed in basal [[Coelurosauria|coelurosaurs]] and [[Allosauroidea|allosauroids]], which the describers attributed to [[mosaic evolution]], the evolution of certain anatomical traits at different times in separate species.<ref name=\"AXRK12\" /> \n\n[[File:Spinosauridae_\"Sails\"_Comparison_by_PaleoGeek.png|thumb|upright=1.3|alt=Three pairs of illustrated fossil pelvic bones and spinal columns compared to the silhouette of a human to their left, Ichthyovenator's pelvis and vertebrae first from the bottom|Comparison of the [[pelvic region]] and [[Neural spine sail|neural spine sails]] of ''[[Suchomimus]]'', ''[[Spinosaurus]]'', and ''Ichthyovenator'']]\n\nIn 2014, Allain's abstract instead found that ''Ichthyovenator'' was part of the subfamily [[Spinosaurinae]], due to the lack of serrations on its teeth and possession of vertebrae with some similarities to those of ''Sigilmassasaurus''.<ref name=\":0\" /> In 2015, a [[Phylogenetics|phylogenetic]] analysis by Evers and colleagues suggested that given the apparent presence of both baryonychine and spinosaurine characteristics in ''Ichthyovenator'', the distinction between the two subfamilies may not be as clear as previously thought.<ref name=\":1\" /> Mortimer hypothesized in 2017 that ''Ichthyovenator'' may not have been a spinosaurid at all, instead possibly being a sail-backed [[Carcharodontosauridae|carcharodontosaurid]] dinosaur closely related to ''[[Concavenator]]''.

In this illustration, the Sun is schematically positioned at the start of Aquarius ([[Image:Aquarius.svg|11px]]).]]\n[[Western astrology]] is a direct continuation of [[Hellenistic astrology]] as recorded by [[Ptolemy]] in the 2nd century. Hellenistic astrology in turn was partly based on concepts from [[Babylonian astrology|Babylonian tradition]]. Specifically, the division of the ecliptic in twelve equal sectors is a Babylonian conceptual construction.<ref>Sachs (1948), p. 289.\nIsolated references to celestial \"signs\" in Sumerian sources are insufficient to speak of a Sumerian zodiac, see Rochberg (1998), p. ''ix''.</ref> \n\nBy the 4th century BC, Babylonian astronomy and its system of celestial omens had an influence on the culture of [[ancient Greece]], as did the astronomy of Egypt by late 2nd century BC. This resulted, unlike the Mesopotamian tradition, in a strong focus on the birth chart of the individual and in the creation of [[Horoscopic astrology]], employing the use of the [[Ascendant]] (the rising degree of the ecliptic, at the time of birth), and of the twelve [[House (astrology)|houses]]. Association of the astrological signs with [[Empedocles]]' four classical [[Classical element|elements]] was another important development in the characterization of the twelve signs.\n\nThe body of the Hellenistic astrological tradition as it stood by the 2nd century is described in Ptolemy's ''[[Tetrabiblos]]''. This is the seminal work for later astronomical tradition not only in the West but also in India and in the Islamic sphere, and has remained a reference for almost seventeen centuries as later traditions made few substantial changes to its core teachings.\n\nThe following table enumerates the twelve divisions of celestial longitude, with the Latin names (still widely used) and the English translation (gloss), which express the [[constellation]] they are named for. The longitude [[Interval (mathematics)#Notations for intervals|intervals]], are treated as closed for the first endpoint (''a'') and open for the second (''b'') \u2013 for instance, 30\u00b0 of longitude is the first point of Taurus, not part of Aries. The sign numbers, 0 through 11, are seen instead of the symbols in some astronomical works.\n\nAny association of calendar dates with these signs only makes sense when referring to [[Sun sign astrology]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n! scope=\"col\" | Sign\n! scope=\"col\" | Symbol\n! scope=\"col\" | Number\n! scope=\"col\" | Ecliptic longitude<br>(''a'' \u2264 {{math|''&lambda;''}} < ''b'')\n! scope=\"col\" | Gloss\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[Aries (astrology)|Aries]]\n|[[Image:Aries.svg|20px]]\n|0\n|0\u00b0 to 30\u00b0\n|The [[Sheep|Ram]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[Taurus (astrology)|Taurus]]\n|[[Image:Taurus.svg|20px]]\n|1\n|30\u00b0 to 60\u00b0\n|The [[Bull]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[Gemini (astrology)|Gemini]]\n|[[Image:Gemini.svg|20px]]\n|2\n|60\u00b0 to 90\u00b0\n|The [[Twin]]s\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[Cancer (astrology)|Cancer]]\n|[[Image:Cancer.svg|20px]]\n|3\n|90\u00b0 to 120\u00b0\n|The [[Crab]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[Leo (astrology)|Leo]]\n|[[Image:Leo.svg|20px]]\n|4\n|120\u00b0 to 150\u00b0\n|The [[Lion]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[Virgo (astrology)|Virgo]]\n|[[Image:Virgo.svg|20px]]\n|5\n|150\u00b0 to 180\u00b0\n|The [[Maiden]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[Libra (astrology)|Libra]]\n|[[Image:Libra.svg|24px]]\n|6\n|180\u00b0 to 210\u00b0\n|The [[Weighing scale|Scales]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[Scorpio (astrology)|Scorpio]]\n|[[Image:Scorpio.svg|20px]]\n|7\n|210\u00b0 to 240\u00b0\n|The [[Scorpion]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[Sagittarius (astrology)|Sagittarius]]\n|[[Image:Sagittarius.svg|20px]]\n|8\n|240\u00b0 to 270\u00b0\n|The [[Archery|Archer]] ([[Centaur]])\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[Capricorn (astrology)|Capricorn]]\n|[[Image:Capricorn.svg|26px]]\n|9\n|270\u00b0 to 300\u00b0\n|The [[Goat]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[Aquarius (astrology)|Aquarius]]\n|[[Image:Aquarius.svg|24px]]\n|10\n|300\u00b0 to 330\u00b0\n|The [[water carrier|Water-bearer]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[Pisces (astrology)|Pisces]]\n|[[Image:Pisces.svg|20px]]\n|11\n|330\u00b0 to 360\u00b0\n|The [[Fish]]\n|}\n\n=== Polarity and the four elements ===\n{{main|Triplicity}}\n{{Further|Classical element}}\n<!-- \n     HIDDEN EDITOR NOTE:\n     DO NOT ADD ANY INFORMATION WITHOUT CITING A RELIABLE SOURCE\n     UNSOURCED ADDITIONS WILL BE REMOVED\n-->\n\n[[Image:Sign position example.svg|220px|thumb|right|A simple diagram displaying the planets' sign positions on May 16th, 2012.

By contrast, they are held to find some signs to be weak or difficult to operate in because their natures are thought to be in conflict. These categories are Dignity, Detriment, Exaltation and Fall. \n\n* '''[[Essential dignity|Dignity]]''' and '''[[Detriment (astrology)|Detriment]]''': A [[Planets in astrology|planet]] is strengthened or '''dignified''' if it falls within the sign that it rules. In other words, it is said to exercise ''[[Domicile (astrology)|Rulership]]'' of the sign. For example, the Moon in Cancer is considered \"strong\" (well-dignified). If a planet is in the sign opposite which it rules (or is dignified in), it is said to be weakened or in '''Detriment''' (for example, the Moon in Capricorn).<ref name=\"glossary\">\"Glossary of Astrological Terms\". Logos, Asaa 1998\u20132004. 26 Nov 2007. {{cite web|url=http://logosastrology.dk/glossary.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-11-29 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080122142135/http://logosastrology.dk/glossary.htm |archivedate=2008-01-22 |df= }}</ref>\n\nIn traditional astrology, other levels of Dignity are recognised in addition to Rulership. These are known as Exaltation, [[Triplicity]], [[Terms or bounds]], and Face or [[Decans|Decan]], which together are known as describing a planet's ''[[Essential dignity]]'', the quality or ability of one's true nature.<ref name=\"glossary\" />\n\n* '''[[Exaltation (astrology)|Exaltation]]''' and '''[[Astrological fall|Fall]]''': In addition, a planet is also strengthened when it is in its sign of '''Exaltation'''. In traditional horary astrology, Exaltation denotes a level of dignity somewhat exaggerated compared to rulership. Exaltation was considered to give the planet (or what it signified in a horary chart) dignity, with the metaphor of an honoured guest \u2013 who is the centre of attention but the extent of their ability to act is limited. Examples of planets in their Exaltation are: Saturn (Libra), Sun (Aries), Venus (Pisces), Moon (Taurus), Mercury (Virgo, although some disagree to this classification), Mars (Capricorn), Jupiter (Cancer). A planet in the opposite sign of its Exaltation is said to be in its '''Fall''', and thus weakened, perhaps seemingly more so than Detriment.<ref name=\"glossary\" /> There is no agreement as to the signs in which the three extra-Saturnian planets may be considered to be exalted.<ref>Hone (1978), p. 144</ref>\n\nThe following table summarizes the positions described above:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!

This is placement by [[astrological house|house]] in the chart under examination. Accidental dignity is the planet's \"ability to act.\" So we might have, for example, Moon in Cancer, dignified by rulership, is placed in the 12th house it would have little scope to express its good nature.<ref>{{cite web|title=Accidental Dignity|publisher= Astrological Dictionary 1998\u20132007|website= www.gotohoroscope.com|date= 26 November 2007|url= http://www.gotohoroscope.com/dictionary/astrological/5.html}}</ref> The 12th is a cadent house as are the 3rd, 6th and 9th and planets in these houses are considered weak or afflicted. On the other hand, Moon in the 1st, 4th, 7th or 10th would be more able to act as these are Angular houses. Planets in Succedent houses of the chart (2nd, 5th, 8th, 11th) are generally considered to be of medium ability to act. Besides Accidental Dignity, there are a range of ''Accidental Debilities'', such as retrogradation, Under the Sun's Beams, Combust, and so forth.\n\n=== Additional classifications ===\n<!-- \n     HIDDEN EDITOR NOTE:\n     DO NOT ADD ANY INFORMATION WITHOUT CITING A RELIABLE SOURCE\n     UNSOURCED ADDITIONS WILL BE REMOVED\n-->\n{{Details|Decans}}\nEach sign can be divided into three 10\u00b0 sectors known as decans or decanates, though these have fallen into disuse. The first decanate is said to be most emphatically of its own nature and is ruled by the sign ruler.<ref>Hone (1978), p.&nbsp;87</ref> The next decanate is sub-ruled by the planet ruling the next sign in the same triplicity. The last decanate is sub-ruled by the next in order in the same triplicity.<ref>Hone (1978), p.&nbsp;88</ref>\n\nWhile the element and modality of a sign are together sufficient to define it, they can be grouped to indicate their symbolism. The first four signs, Aries, Taurus, Gemini and Cancer, form the group of personal signs. The next four signs, Leo, Virgo, Libra and Scorpio form the group of interpersonal signs.

The order of the astrological signs is [[Aries (astrology)|Aries]], [[Taurus (astrology)|Taurus]], [[Gemini (astrology)|Gemini]], [[Cancer (astrology)|Cancer]], [[Leo (astrology)|Leo]], [[Virgo (astrology)|Virgo]], [[Libra (astrology)|Libra]], [[Scorpio (astrology)|Scorpio]], [[Sagittarius (astrology)|Sagittarius]], [[Capricorn (astrology)|Capricorn]], [[Aquarius (astrology)|Aquarius]] and [[Pisces (astrology)|Pisces]]. Each sector was named for a constellation it was passing through in times of naming.\n\nThe concept of the [[zodiac]] originated in [[Babylonian astrology]], and was later influenced by [[Hellenistic astrology|Hellenistic]] culture.

Western astrology measures from [[Equinox]] and [[Solstice]] points (points relating to equal, longest and shortest days of the [[tropical year]]), while [[Jyoti\u1e63a]] or [[Vedic astrology]] measures along the equatorial plane ([[sidereal year]]). [[Precession]] results in Western astrology's zodiacal divisions not corresponding in the current era to the [[constellations]] that carry similar names,<ref>Bobrick (2005), pp. 10, 23.</ref> while [[Jyoti\u1e63a]] measurements still correspond with the background constellations.<ref>Johnsen (2004).</ref>\n\n== Western zodiac signs ==\n=== History and symbolism ===\n{{main|Zodiac|History of astrology}}\n{{further|Babylonian astrology|Hellenistic astrology|Ancient Egyptian astronomy}}\n[[Image:Sign cusps.png|250px|thumb|right|The twelve ecliptic signs.

In this illustration, the Sun is schematically positioned at the start of Aquarius ([[Image:Aquarius.svg|11px]]).]]\n[[Western astrology]] is a direct continuation of [[Hellenistic astrology]] as recorded by [[Ptolemy]] in the 2nd century. Hellenistic astrology in turn was partly based on concepts from [[Babylonian astrology|Babylonian tradition]]. Specifically, the division of the ecliptic in twelve equal sectors is a Babylonian conceptual construction.<ref>Sachs (1948), p. 289.\nIsolated references to celestial \"signs\" in Sumerian sources are insufficient to speak of a Sumerian zodiac, see Rochberg (1998), p. ''ix''.</ref> \n\nBy the 4th century BC, Babylonian astronomy and its system of celestial omens had an influence on the culture of [[ancient Greece]], as did the astronomy of Egypt by late 2nd century BC. This resulted, unlike the Mesopotamian tradition, in a strong focus on the birth chart of the individual and in the creation of [[Horoscopic astrology]], employing the use of the [[Ascendant]] (the rising degree of the ecliptic, at the time of birth), and of the twelve [[House (astrology)|houses]]. Association of the astrological signs with [[Empedocles]]' four classical [[Classical element|elements]] was another important development in the characterization of the twelve signs.\n\nThe body of the Hellenistic astrological tradition as it stood by the 2nd century is described in Ptolemy's ''[[Tetrabiblos]]''. This is the seminal work for later astronomical tradition not only in the West but also in India and in the Islamic sphere, and has remained a reference for almost seventeen centuries as later traditions made few substantial changes to its core teachings.\n\nThe following table enumerates the twelve divisions of celestial longitude, with the Latin names (still widely used) and the English translation (gloss), which express the [[constellation]] they are named for. The longitude [[Interval (mathematics)#Notations for intervals|intervals]], are treated as closed for the first endpoint (''a'') and open for the second (''b'') \u2013 for instance, 30\u00b0 of longitude is the first point of Taurus, not part of Aries. The sign numbers, 0 through 11, are seen instead of the symbols in some astronomical works.\n\nAny association of calendar dates with these signs only makes sense when referring to [[Sun sign astrology]].\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n! scope=\"col\" | Sign\n! scope=\"col\" | Symbol\n! scope=\"col\" | Number\n! scope=\"col\" | Ecliptic longitude<br>(''a'' \u2264 {{math|''&lambda;''}} < ''b'')\n! scope=\"col\" | Gloss\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[Aries (astrology)|Aries]]\n|[[Image:Aries.svg|20px]]\n|0\n|0\u00b0 to 30\u00b0\n|The [[Sheep|Ram]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[Taurus (astrology)|Taurus]]\n|[[Image:Taurus.svg|20px]]\n|1\n|30\u00b0 to 60\u00b0\n|The [[Bull]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[Gemini (astrology)|Gemini]]\n|[[Image:Gemini.svg|20px]]\n|2\n|60\u00b0 to 90\u00b0\n|The [[Twin]]s\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[Cancer (astrology)|Cancer]]\n|[[Image:Cancer.svg|20px]]\n|3\n|90\u00b0 to 120\u00b0\n|The [[Crab]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[Leo (astrology)|Leo]]\n|[[Image:Leo.svg|20px]]\n|4\n|120\u00b0 to 150\u00b0\n|The [[Lion]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[Virgo (astrology)|Virgo]]\n|[[Image:Virgo.svg|20px]]\n|5\n|150\u00b0 to 180\u00b0\n|The [[Maiden]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[Libra (astrology)|Libra]]\n|[[Image:Libra.svg|24px]]\n|6\n|180\u00b0 to 210\u00b0\n|The [[Weighing scale|Scales]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[Scorpio (astrology)|Scorpio]]\n|[[Image:Scorpio.svg|20px]]\n|7\n|210\u00b0 to 240\u00b0\n|The [[Scorpion]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[Sagittarius (astrology)|Sagittarius]]\n|[[Image:Sagittarius.svg|20px]]\n|8\n|240\u00b0 to 270\u00b0\n|The [[Archery|Archer]] ([[Centaur]])\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[Capricorn (astrology)|Capricorn]]\n|[[Image:Capricorn.svg|26px]]\n|9\n|270\u00b0 to 300\u00b0\n|The [[Goat]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[Aquarius (astrology)|Aquarius]]\n|[[Image:Aquarius.svg|24px]]\n|10\n|300\u00b0 to 330\u00b0\n|The [[water carrier|Water-bearer]]\n|-\n! scope=\"row\" | [[Pisces (astrology)|Pisces]]\n|[[Image:Pisces.svg|20px]]\n|11\n|330\u00b0 to 360\u00b0\n|The [[Fish]]\n|}\n\n=== Polarity and the four elements ===\n{{main|Triplicity}}\n{{Further|Classical element}}\n<!-- \n     HIDDEN EDITOR NOTE:\n     DO NOT ADD ANY INFORMATION WITHOUT CITING A RELIABLE SOURCE\n     UNSOURCED ADDITIONS WILL BE REMOVED\n-->\n\n[[Image:Sign position example.svg|220px|thumb|right|A simple diagram displaying the planets' sign positions on May 16th, 2012.

He explained the nature of the universe as an interaction of two opposing principles called love and strife manipulating the four elements, and stated that these four elements were all equal, of the same age, that each rules its own province, and each possesses its own individual character. Different mixtures of these elements produced the different natures of things. Empedocles said that those who were born with near equal proportions of the four elements are more intelligent and have the most exact perceptions.<ref name=\"Charlie Higgins\">{{cite web|url=http://accessnewage.com/Articles/astro/HIGELEMS.HTM |title=Astrology and The Four Elements |author=Charlie Higgins |year=1997 |accessdate=2009-12-27 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100103102752/http://accessnewage.com/articles/astro/HIGELEMS.HTM |archivedate=2010-01-03 |df= }}</ref>\n\nEach sign is associated with one of the [[classical element]]s (fire, air, earth, and water),<ref name=\"RobLeo\">Pelletier, Robert, and Leonard Cataldo (1984).

By contrast, they are held to find some signs to be weak or difficult to operate in because their natures are thought to be in conflict. These categories are Dignity, Detriment, Exaltation and Fall. \n\n* '''[[Essential dignity|Dignity]]''' and '''[[Detriment (astrology)|Detriment]]''': A [[Planets in astrology|planet]] is strengthened or '''dignified''' if it falls within the sign that it rules. In other words, it is said to exercise ''[[Domicile (astrology)|Rulership]]'' of the sign. For example, the Moon in Cancer is considered \"strong\" (well-dignified). If a planet is in the sign opposite which it rules (or is dignified in), it is said to be weakened or in '''Detriment''' (for example, the Moon in Capricorn).<ref name=\"glossary\">\"Glossary of Astrological Terms\". Logos, Asaa 1998\u20132004. 26 Nov 2007. {{cite web|url=http://logosastrology.dk/glossary.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-11-29 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080122142135/http://logosastrology.dk/glossary.htm |archivedate=2008-01-22 |df= }}</ref>\n\nIn traditional astrology, other levels of Dignity are recognised in addition to Rulership. These are known as Exaltation, [[Triplicity]], [[Terms or bounds]], and Face or [[Decans|Decan]], which together are known as describing a planet's ''[[Essential dignity]]'', the quality or ability of one's true nature.<ref name=\"glossary\" />\n\n* '''[[Exaltation (astrology)|Exaltation]]''' and '''[[Astrological fall|Fall]]''': In addition, a planet is also strengthened when it is in its sign of '''Exaltation'''. In traditional horary astrology, Exaltation denotes a level of dignity somewhat exaggerated compared to rulership. Exaltation was considered to give the planet (or what it signified in a horary chart) dignity, with the metaphor of an honoured guest \u2013 who is the centre of attention but the extent of their ability to act is limited. Examples of planets in their Exaltation are: Saturn (Libra), Sun (Aries), Venus (Pisces), Moon (Taurus), Mercury (Virgo, although some disagree to this classification), Mars (Capricorn), Jupiter (Cancer). A planet in the opposite sign of its Exaltation is said to be in its '''Fall''', and thus weakened, perhaps seemingly more so than Detriment.<ref name=\"glossary\" /> There is no agreement as to the signs in which the three extra-Saturnian planets may be considered to be exalted.<ref>Hone (1978), p. 144</ref>\n\nThe following table summarizes the positions described above:\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align:center\"\n|-\n!

This is placement by [[astrological house|house]] in the chart under examination. Accidental dignity is the planet's \"ability to act.\" So we might have, for example, Moon in Cancer, dignified by rulership, is placed in the 12th house it would have little scope to express its good nature.<ref>{{cite web|title=Accidental Dignity|publisher= Astrological Dictionary 1998\u20132007|website= www.gotohoroscope.com|date= 26 November 2007|url= http://www.gotohoroscope.com/dictionary/astrological/5.html}}</ref> The 12th is a cadent house as are the 3rd, 6th and 9th and planets in these houses are considered weak or afflicted. On the other hand, Moon in the 1st, 4th, 7th or 10th would be more able to act as these are Angular houses. Planets in Succedent houses of the chart (2nd, 5th, 8th, 11th) are generally considered to be of medium ability to act. Besides Accidental Dignity, there are a range of ''Accidental Debilities'', such as retrogradation, Under the Sun's Beams, Combust, and so forth.\n\n=== Additional classifications ===\n<!-- \n     HIDDEN EDITOR NOTE:\n     DO NOT ADD ANY INFORMATION WITHOUT CITING A RELIABLE SOURCE\n     UNSOURCED ADDITIONS WILL BE REMOVED\n-->\n{{Details|Decans}}\nEach sign can be divided into three 10\u00b0 sectors known as decans or decanates, though these have fallen into disuse. The first decanate is said to be most emphatically of its own nature and is ruled by the sign ruler.<ref>Hone (1978), p.&nbsp;87</ref> The next decanate is sub-ruled by the planet ruling the next sign in the same triplicity. The last decanate is sub-ruled by the next in order in the same triplicity.<ref>Hone (1978), p.&nbsp;88</ref>\n\nWhile the element and modality of a sign are together sufficient to define it, they can be grouped to indicate their symbolism. The first four signs, Aries, Taurus, Gemini and Cancer, form the group of personal signs. The next four signs, Leo, Virgo, Libra and Scorpio form the group of interpersonal signs.

The five elements appear in the calendar in both their yin and yang forms and are known as the ten [[Celestial stem]]s. When trying to calculate the relevant year of the cycle in relation to the [[Gregorian calendar]], an easy rule to follow is that years that end in an even number are Yang (representing masculine, active and light), those that end with an odd number are Yin (representing feminine, passive and darkness).<ref name=Wu>Chinese Astrology:  Exploring the Eastern Zodiac by Shelly Wu</ref>\n\n== Notes ==\n{{reflist|33em}}\n\n== References ==\n*Arroyo, Stephen (1975).
