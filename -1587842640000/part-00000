Each state affiliate has a governing committee, usually consisting of statewide officers elected by state party members and regional representation of one kind or another. Similarly, county, town, city and ward committees, where organized, generally consist of members elected at the local level. State and local committees often coordinate campaign activities within their jurisdiction, oversee local conventions and in some cases primaries or caucuses and may have a role in nominating candidates for elected office under state law.\n\n=== Membership ===\nSince the Libertarian Party's inception, individuals have been able to join the party as voting members by signing their agreement with the organization's [[Libertarian pledge|membership pledge]], which states that the signer does not advocate the initiation of force to achieve political or social goals. During the mid-1980s and into the early 1990s, this membership category was called an \"instant\" membership, but currently, these are referred to as \"signature members\". People joining the party are also asked to pay dues, which are on a sliding scale starting at $25 per year. Lifetime membership is granted with a $1,500 donation in one calendar year.

[...] Our goal is nothing more nor less than a world set free in our lifetime, and it is to this end that we take these stands\". Its Statement of Principles begins: \"We, the members of the Libertarian Party, challenge the cult of the omnipotent state and defend the rights of the individual\". The Statement of Principles is foundational to the ideology of the party and was created specifically to bind the party to certain core principles with a high parliamentary burden for any amendment.<ref>{{cite web |last = Ann |first = Caryn |url = http://www.independentpoliticalreport.com/2015/09/d-frank-robinson-the-libertarian-party-statement-of-principles/ |title = D.

The party opposes [[gun control]]. It calls for [[United States Constitution|Constitutional]] limitations on government as well as the elimination of most state functions. It includes a \"Self-determination\" section which quotes from the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]] and reads: \"Whenever any form of government becomes destructive of individual liberty, it is the right of the people to alter or to abolish it, and to agree to such new governance as to them shall seem most likely to protect their liberty\". It also includes an \"Omissions\" section which reads: \"Our silence about any other particular government law, regulation, ordinance, directive, edict, control, regulatory agency, activity, or machination should not be construed to imply approval\".<ref name=platform/>\n\nThe party favors minimally regulated markets, a less powerful [[federal government]], strong [[civil liberties]] (including [[LGBT rights]], with the party supporting [[same-sex marriage]]), the [[drug liberalization|liberalization of drug laws]], [[separation of church and state]], [[open immigration]], [[non-interventionism]] and [[neutrality (international relations)|neutrality]] in diplomatic relations, [[free trade]] and [[freedom of movement|free movement]] to all foreign countries and a more representative republic.<ref name=platform>{{cite web |url = http://www.lp.org/platform |title= Libertarian Party: Platform |publisher = Libertarian Party |access-date = June 6, 2012 }}</ref> The party's position on abortion is that government should stay out of the matter and leave it to the individual, but recognizes that some \"good-faith\" opinions on this issue are different.<ref name=\"abortion1.4\">{{cite web |work = Platform |url = http://www.lp.org/platform |title = 1.4 Abortion |publisher = Libertarian Party |access-date = March 8, 2013 }}</ref> [[Ron Paul]], one of the former presidential nominees of the Libertarian Party in 1988, is strictly [[anti-abortion]].

modern [[welfare state]]. It adopts pro-[[civil liberties]] and pro-[[cultural liberalism|cultural liberal]] approaches to cultural and social issues. Paul H. Rubin, professor of law and economics at [[Emory University]], believes that while [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] generally seek to control economic activities and [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] generally seek to control consumption activities such as sexual behavior, abortion and so on, the Libertarian Party is the largest political party in the United States that advocates few or no regulations in what he deems \"social\" and \"economic\" issues.<ref>{{cite book |title = Darwinian politics: The Evolutionary Origin of Freedom |first = Paul H. |last = Rubin |year = 2002 |publisher = [[Rutgers University Press]] |isbn = 978-0-8135-3096-3 |page = 130 |url = https://books.google.com/?id=qZ1mSn7BoLMC&pg=PA130 }}</ref>\n\n=== Economic issues ===\nThe \"poverty and welfare\" issues page of the Libertarian Party's website says that it opposes [[Regulatory economics|regulation]] of capitalist [[Institutional economics|economic institutions]] and advocates dismantling the entirety of the welfare state: <blockquote>We should eliminate the entire social welfare system. This includes eliminating food stamps, subsidized housing, and all the rest.

Seeing the education of children as a parental responsibility, the party would give authority to parents to determine the education of their children at their expense without interference from government. This includes ending [[School corporal punishment in the United States|corporal punishment]] within [[State school|public schools]]. Libertarians have expressed that parents should have control of and responsibility for all funds expended for their children's education.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web |url = http://www.lp.org/platform |title = Platform|publisher = Libertarian Party |access-date = January 29, 2016 }}</ref>\n\n==== Environment ====\n{{see also|Free-market environmentalism}}\nThe Libertarian Party supports a clean and healthy environment and sensible use of [[natural resources]], believing that private landowners and conservation groups have a vested interest in maintaining such natural resources.<ref name=platform /> The party has also expressed that \"governments, unlike private businesses, are unaccountable for such damage done to the environment and have a terrible track record when it comes to environmental protection\".<ref name=\"Platform\">{{cite web |url = http://www.lp.org/platform |title = Platform|publisher = Libertarian Party |access-date = May 5, 2015 }}</ref> The party contends that the environment is best protected when individual rights pertaining to natural resources are clearly defined and enforced. The party also contends that [[free market]]s and [[Property rights (economics)|property rights]] (implicitly without government intervention) will stimulate the technological innovations and behavioral changes required to protect the environment and ecosystem because environmental advocates and [[social pressure]] are the most effective means of changing public behavior.<ref name=\"Platform\"/>\n\n==== Fiscal policies ====\nThe Libertarian Party opposes all government intervention and regulation on wages, [[price]]s, [[Renting|rents]], [[Profit (accounting)|profits]], production and [[interest rate]]s and advocate the repeal of all laws banning or restricting the advertising of [[price]]s, products, or services. The party's recent platform calls for the repeal of the [[income tax]], the abolition of the [[Internal Revenue Service]] and all federal programs and services, such as the [[Federal Reserve System]]. The party supports the passage of a [[Balanced Budget Amendment]] to the Constitution which they believe will significantly lower the [[National debt of the United States|national debt]], provided that the budget is balanced preferably by cutting expenditures and not by raising taxes. Libertarians favor free-market banking, with unrestricted competition among banks and depository institutions of all types. The party also wants a halt to [[inflationary]] monetary policies and legal tender laws. While the party defends the right of individuals to form corporations, cooperatives and other types of companies, it opposes government [[subsidies]] to business, labor, or any other [[special interest]].<ref name=\"Platform\" />\n\n==== Healthcare ====\nThe Libertarian Party favors a [[Free-market healthcare|free market health care]] system without government oversight, approval, regulation, or licensing. The party states that it \"recognizes the freedom of individuals to determine the level of [[health insurance]] they can afford (if any), the amount of health care they can afford, the care providers they can afford, the medicines and treatments they can use and all other aspects of their [[medical care]], including the many end-of-life decisions that will follow\". They support the repeal of all social insurance policies such as [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] and [[Medicaid]] and favor \"consumer-driven health care\".<ref>{{cite press release |url = https://www.lp.org/news/press-releases/libertarian-party-opposes-health-care-plan |date = March 19, 2010 |title = Libertarian Party opposes health care plan |publisher = Libertarian Party |access-date = August 2, 2016 }}</ref> The Libertarian Party has been advocating for Americans' ability to purchase health insurance across state lines.\n\n==== Immigration and trade agreements ====\nThe Libertarian Party consistently lobbies for the removal of governmental impediments to free trade. This is because their platform states that \"political freedom and escape from tyranny demand that individuals not be unreasonably constrained by government in the crossing of political boundaries\".<ref name=\"lp.org\">{{cite web |url = https://www.lp.org/platform |title = Platform|publisher = Libertarian Party |access-date = May 5, 2015 }}</ref> To promote economic freedom, they demand the unrestricted movement of humans as well as financial capital across national borders.

The party supports the right of free persons to associate or not associate in [[Trade union|labor unions]] and believes that employers should have the right to recognize or refuse to recognize a union.<ref name=\"Platform\"/>\n\n==== Retirement and Social Security ====\nThe party believes that retirement planning is the responsibility of the individual, not the government. Libertarians would phase out the current government-sponsored [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] system and transition to a [[Privatization|private]] voluntary system. The Libertarians feel that the proper and most effective source of help for the poor is the voluntary efforts of [[Charitable organization|private groups]] and individuals, believing members of society will become more charitable and civil society will be strengthened as government reduces its activity in that realm.<ref name=\"Platform\" />\n\n=== Social issues ===\nThe Libertarian Party supports the legalization of all [[victimless crimes]],<ref name=\"http://www.lp.org/platform\">{{cite web|url=http://www.lp.org/platform|title=Platform &#124; Libertarian Party|publisher=Libertarian Party|date=|accessdate=January 29, 2016}}</ref> including [[Recreational drug use|drugs]],<ref name=\"Eagles Johnston\">{{cite book|title=Politics: An Introduction to Modern Democratic Government|last1=Eagles|first1=Munroe|last2=Johnston|first2=Larry|year=2008|publisher=[[University of Toronto Press]]|isbn=978-1-55111-858-1|page=110|url=https://books.google.com/?id=uw9BHYRdtsAC&pg=PA110}}</ref><ref name=\"Libertarian struggle\">{{cite news|first=Karin|last=Miller|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=uOwjAAAAIBAJ&sjid=xewDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6583,6407110&dq=prostitution+libertarian-party&hl=en|title=Libertarian struggle to be taken seriously in presidential race|work=[[Deseret News]]|agency=Associated Press|date=September 12\u201313, 1996}}</ref><ref name=\"Co-founder\">{{cite news|first=Emma|last=Brown|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/11/23/AR2010112306604.html|title=Co-founder of national Libertarian Party|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=November 24, 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"GALLOWAY Libertarian\">{{cite news|first=Angela|last=Galloway|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/default/article/For-Libertarians-winning-is-a-work-in-progress-1155744.php |title = For Libertarians, winning is a work in progress|work=[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]|date=October 3, 2004}}</ref> [[Libertarian Party (United States)#Pornography|pornography]],<ref name=\"Eagles Johnston\"/> [[Libertarian Party (United States)#Prostitution|prostitution]],<ref name=\"Eagles Johnston\"/><ref name=\"Libertarian struggle\"/><ref name=\"Co-founder\"/><ref name=\"GALLOWAY Libertarian\"/> [[polygamy]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.azlp.org/platform.php|publisher=Arizona Libertarian Party|title=Home|accessdate=May 5, 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150503140844/http://www.azlp.org/platform.php|archivedate=May 3, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref> and [[gambling]],<ref>{{cite book|title=Understanding American Government and Politics|first=Duncan|last=Watts|year=2006|publisher=[[Manchester University Press]]|isbn=978-0-7190-7327-4|page=246|url=https://books.google.com/?id=SIeIARfRc1AC&pg=RA2-PT124}}</ref> supports the removal of restrictions on [[Libertarian Party (United States)#LGBT issues|homosexuality]],<ref name=\"Co-founder\"/> opposes any kind of [[censorship]] and supports [[freedom of speech]],<ref name=\"Freedom of Speech\">{{cite web|url=http://www.lp.org/issues/freedom-of-speech|title=Freedom of Speech|publisher=Libertarian Party|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514110414/http://www.lp.org/issues/freedom-of-speech|archivedate=May 14, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref> and supports the [[right to keep and bear arms]]<ref name=\"Libertarian struggle\"/> while opposing Federal capital punishment.<ref name=\"ontheissues.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ontheissues.org/Celeb/Libertarian_Party_Crime.htm|title=Libertarian Party on Crime|work=OnTheIssues.org|date=|accessdate=January 29, 2016}}</ref> The Libertarian Party's platform states: \"Government does not have the authority to define, license or restrict [[personal relationship]]s.

Some, like the group [[Libertarians for Life]], consider abortion to be an act of aggression from the government or mother against a fetus. Others, like the group Pro-Choice Libertarians, consider denying a woman the right to choose abortion to be an act of aggression from the government against her.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pro-choicelibertarians.net/|title=Pro-Choice Libertarians|accessdate=July 12, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==== Crime and capital punishment ====\n{{see also|Libertarian perspectives on capital punishment}}\nShortly before the [[2000 United States presidential election|2000 elections]], the party released a \"Libertarian Party Program on Crime\" in which they criticize the failures of a recently proposed Omnibus Crime Bill, especially detailing how it expands the list of [[capital crime]]s.<ref name=\"ontheissues.org\"/> Denouncing Federal executions, they also describe how the party would increase and safeguard the [[rights of the accused]] in legal settings as well as limit the use of [[excessive force]] by police. Instead, criminal laws would be reduced to violations of the rights of others through either force or fraud with maximum [[restitution]] given to victims of the criminals or negligent persons.<ref name=\"lp.org\"/> In 2016, the party expanded their platform to officially support the repeal of capital punishment.<ref name=\"http://www.lp.org/platform#1.8\">[http://www.lp.org/platform#1.8 \"2016 platform\"].</ref>\n\n==== Freedom of speech and censorship ====\nThe Libertarian Party supports unrestricted freedom of speech and is opposed to any kind of [[censorship]]. The party describes the issue in its website: \"We defend the rights of individuals to unrestricted freedom of speech, [[freedom of the press]] and the right of individuals to [[dissent]] from government itself. [...] We oppose any abridgment of the freedom of speech through government censorship, regulation or control of communications media\". The party claims it is the only political party in the United States \"with an explicit stand against censorship of computer communications in its platform\".<ref name=\"Freedom of Speech\"/>\n\n==== Government reform ====\nThe Libertarian Party favors election systems that are more representative of the [[Electoral district|electorate]] at the [[United States federal government|federal]], state and [[local government|local]] levels. The party platform calls for an end to any tax-financed subsidies to candidates or parties and the repeal of all laws which restrict voluntary financing of election campaigns. As a [[minor party]], it opposes laws that effectively exclude alternative candidates and parties, deny [[ballot access]], [[gerrymander]] districts, or deny the voters their right to consider all legitimate alternatives. Libertarians also promote the use of [[direct democracy]] through the [[referendum]] and [[recall election|recall]] processes.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\n==== LGBT issues ====\nThe Libertarian Party advocates repealing all laws that control or prohibit homosexuality.<ref name=calp>{{Cite web|url=http://ca.lp.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Platform-of-the-Libertarian-Party-of-California-as-amended-in-Convention-March-3-2012.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403014848/http://ca.lp.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Platform-of-the-Libertarian-Party-of-California-as-amended-in-Convention-March-3-2012.pdf|url-status=dead|title=Platform of the Libertarian Party of California as amended in Convention March 3, 2012|archivedate=April 3, 2015}}</ref> According to the Libertarian Party's platform: \"Sexual orientation, preference, gender, or gender identity should have no impact on the government's treatment of individuals, such as in current marriage, child custody, adoption, immigration or military service laws\".<ref name=Platform/>\n\nGay activist Richard Sincere has pointed to the longstanding support of gay rights by the party, which has supported [[same-sex marriage]] since its first platform was drafted in 1972 (40 years before the Democratic Party adopted same-sex marriage into their platform in 2012).

The proposal was incorporated in a new party-wide strategic plan and a joint platform-program committee proposed a reformatted project platform that isolated talking points on issues, principles and solutions as well as an array of projects for adaptation. This platform, along with a short Summary for talking points, was approved in 2004. Confusion arose when prior to the 2006 convention there was a push to repeal or substantially rewrite the Platform, at the center of which were groups such as the Libertarian Reform Caucus.<ref>\"[http://www.reformthelp.org/  Victory in Portland!

Each state affiliate has a governing committee, usually consisting of statewide officers elected by state party members and regional representation of one kind or another. Similarly, county, town, city and ward committees, where organized, generally consist of members elected at the local level. State and local committees often coordinate campaign activities within their jurisdiction, oversee local conventions and in some cases primaries or caucuses and may have a role in nominating candidates for elected office under state law.\n\n=== Membership ===\nSince the Libertarian Party's inception, individuals have been able to join the party as voting members by signing their agreement with the organization's [[Libertarian pledge|membership pledge]], which states that the signer does not advocate the initiation of force to achieve political or social goals. During the mid-1980s and into the early 1990s, this membership category was called an \"instant\" membership, but currently, these are referred to as \"signature members\". People joining the party are also asked to pay dues, which are on a sliding scale starting at $25 per year. Lifetime membership is granted with a $1,500 donation in one calendar year. Dues-paying members receive a subscription to the party's national newspaper, ''LP News''.<ref>{{ISSN|8755-1373}}</ref> Since 2006, membership in the party's state affiliates has been separate from membership in the national party,<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://lpar.org/help/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120221021341/http://lpar.org/help/|url-status=dead|title=Help the LPAR \u00ab Libertarian Party of Arkansas|archivedate=February 21, 2012}}</ref> with each state chapter maintaining its own membership rolls.\n\nMost rights to participate in the governance of the party are limited to \"bylaws-sustaining members\" who have either purchased a lifetime membership or donated at least $25 within the past year. Most state parties maintain separate membership, which may be tied to either payment of dues to the state party, or voter registration as a Libertarian, depending on the state's election laws.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lp.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/2016_LP_Bylaws_and_Convention_Rules_w_2016_JC_Rules.pdf|title=Bylaws|date=2016|website=lp.org}}</ref>\n\n== Platform ==\n{{Duplication|section=yes|dupe=#Political positions|date=September 2019}}\nThe preamble outlines the party's goals: \"As Libertarians, we seek a world of liberty; a world in which all individuals are sovereign over their own lives and no one is forced to sacrifice his or her values for the benefit of others.

Since its founding, the party has apportioned delegate seats to its national convention based on the number of members in each state who have paid minimum dues (with additional delegates given to state affiliates for good performance in winning more votes than normal for the party's presidential candidate). This is the most-used number by party activists. As of December 2017, the Libertarian Party reported that there were 14,445 donating members.<ref name=\"hq.lp.org\"/>\n\nHistorically, dues were $15 throughout the 1980s and in 1991 they were increased to $25. Between February 1, 2006, and the close of the 2006 Libertarian party convention on May 31, 2006, dues were set to $0.<ref name=\"LNC Approves Zero Dues\">\"[http://www.lp.org/lpnews/article_769.shtml LNC Approves Zero Dues]\", ''LP News'', September 1, 2005.

modern [[welfare state]]. It adopts pro-[[civil liberties]] and pro-[[cultural liberalism|cultural liberal]] approaches to cultural and social issues. Paul H. Rubin, professor of law and economics at [[Emory University]], believes that while [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberal]] [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]] generally seek to control economic activities and [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] generally seek to control consumption activities such as sexual behavior, abortion and so on, the Libertarian Party is the largest political party in the United States that advocates few or no regulations in what he deems \"social\" and \"economic\" issues.<ref>{{cite book |title = Darwinian politics: The Evolutionary Origin of Freedom |first = Paul H. |last = Rubin |year = 2002 |publisher = [[Rutgers University Press]] |isbn = 978-0-8135-3096-3 |page = 130 |url = https://books.google.com/?id=qZ1mSn7BoLMC&pg=PA130 }}</ref>\n\n=== Economic issues ===\nThe \"poverty and welfare\" issues page of the Libertarian Party's website says that it opposes [[Regulatory economics|regulation]] of capitalist [[Institutional economics|economic institutions]] and advocates dismantling the entirety of the welfare state: <blockquote>We should eliminate the entire social welfare system. This includes eliminating food stamps, subsidized housing, and all the rest.

Seeing the education of children as a parental responsibility, the party would give authority to parents to determine the education of their children at their expense without interference from government. This includes ending [[School corporal punishment in the United States|corporal punishment]] within [[State school|public schools]]. Libertarians have expressed that parents should have control of and responsibility for all funds expended for their children's education.<ref name=\"auto\">{{cite web |url = http://www.lp.org/platform |title = Platform|publisher = Libertarian Party |access-date = January 29, 2016 }}</ref>\n\n==== Environment ====\n{{see also|Free-market environmentalism}}\nThe Libertarian Party supports a clean and healthy environment and sensible use of [[natural resources]], believing that private landowners and conservation groups have a vested interest in maintaining such natural resources.<ref name=platform /> The party has also expressed that \"governments, unlike private businesses, are unaccountable for such damage done to the environment and have a terrible track record when it comes to environmental protection\".<ref name=\"Platform\">{{cite web |url = http://www.lp.org/platform |title = Platform|publisher = Libertarian Party |access-date = May 5, 2015 }}</ref> The party contends that the environment is best protected when individual rights pertaining to natural resources are clearly defined and enforced. The party also contends that [[free market]]s and [[Property rights (economics)|property rights]] (implicitly without government intervention) will stimulate the technological innovations and behavioral changes required to protect the environment and ecosystem because environmental advocates and [[social pressure]] are the most effective means of changing public behavior.<ref name=\"Platform\"/>\n\n==== Fiscal policies ====\nThe Libertarian Party opposes all government intervention and regulation on wages, [[price]]s, [[Renting|rents]], [[Profit (accounting)|profits]], production and [[interest rate]]s and advocate the repeal of all laws banning or restricting the advertising of [[price]]s, products, or services. The party's recent platform calls for the repeal of the [[income tax]], the abolition of the [[Internal Revenue Service]] and all federal programs and services, such as the [[Federal Reserve System]]. The party supports the passage of a [[Balanced Budget Amendment]] to the Constitution which they believe will significantly lower the [[National debt of the United States|national debt]], provided that the budget is balanced preferably by cutting expenditures and not by raising taxes. Libertarians favor free-market banking, with unrestricted competition among banks and depository institutions of all types. The party also wants a halt to [[inflationary]] monetary policies and legal tender laws. While the party defends the right of individuals to form corporations, cooperatives and other types of companies, it opposes government [[subsidies]] to business, labor, or any other [[special interest]].<ref name=\"Platform\" />\n\n==== Healthcare ====\nThe Libertarian Party favors a [[Free-market healthcare|free market health care]] system without government oversight, approval, regulation, or licensing. The party states that it \"recognizes the freedom of individuals to determine the level of [[health insurance]] they can afford (if any), the amount of health care they can afford, the care providers they can afford, the medicines and treatments they can use and all other aspects of their [[medical care]], including the many end-of-life decisions that will follow\". They support the repeal of all social insurance policies such as [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] and [[Medicaid]] and favor \"consumer-driven health care\".<ref>{{cite press release |url = https://www.lp.org/news/press-releases/libertarian-party-opposes-health-care-plan |date = March 19, 2010 |title = Libertarian Party opposes health care plan |publisher = Libertarian Party |access-date = August 2, 2016 }}</ref> The Libertarian Party has been advocating for Americans' ability to purchase health insurance across state lines.\n\n==== Immigration and trade agreements ====\nThe Libertarian Party consistently lobbies for the removal of governmental impediments to free trade. This is because their platform states that \"political freedom and escape from tyranny demand that individuals not be unreasonably constrained by government in the crossing of political boundaries\".<ref name=\"lp.org\">{{cite web |url = https://www.lp.org/platform |title = Platform|publisher = Libertarian Party |access-date = May 5, 2015 }}</ref> To promote economic freedom, they demand the unrestricted movement of humans as well as financial capital across national borders.

The party supports the right of free persons to associate or not associate in [[Trade union|labor unions]] and believes that employers should have the right to recognize or refuse to recognize a union.<ref name=\"Platform\"/>\n\n==== Retirement and Social Security ====\nThe party believes that retirement planning is the responsibility of the individual, not the government. Libertarians would phase out the current government-sponsored [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] system and transition to a [[Privatization|private]] voluntary system. The Libertarians feel that the proper and most effective source of help for the poor is the voluntary efforts of [[Charitable organization|private groups]] and individuals, believing members of society will become more charitable and civil society will be strengthened as government reduces its activity in that realm.<ref name=\"Platform\" />\n\n=== Social issues ===\nThe Libertarian Party supports the legalization of all [[victimless crimes]],<ref name=\"http://www.lp.org/platform\">{{cite web|url=http://www.lp.org/platform|title=Platform &#124; Libertarian Party|publisher=Libertarian Party|date=|accessdate=January 29, 2016}}</ref> including [[Recreational drug use|drugs]],<ref name=\"Eagles Johnston\">{{cite book|title=Politics: An Introduction to Modern Democratic Government|last1=Eagles|first1=Munroe|last2=Johnston|first2=Larry|year=2008|publisher=[[University of Toronto Press]]|isbn=978-1-55111-858-1|page=110|url=https://books.google.com/?id=uw9BHYRdtsAC&pg=PA110}}</ref><ref name=\"Libertarian struggle\">{{cite news|first=Karin|last=Miller|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=uOwjAAAAIBAJ&sjid=xewDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6583,6407110&dq=prostitution+libertarian-party&hl=en|title=Libertarian struggle to be taken seriously in presidential race|work=[[Deseret News]]|agency=Associated Press|date=September 12\u201313, 1996}}</ref><ref name=\"Co-founder\">{{cite news|first=Emma|last=Brown|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/11/23/AR2010112306604.html|title=Co-founder of national Libertarian Party|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=November 24, 2010}}</ref><ref name=\"GALLOWAY Libertarian\">{{cite news|first=Angela|last=Galloway|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/default/article/For-Libertarians-winning-is-a-work-in-progress-1155744.php |title = For Libertarians, winning is a work in progress|work=[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]|date=October 3, 2004}}</ref> [[Libertarian Party (United States)#Pornography|pornography]],<ref name=\"Eagles Johnston\"/> [[Libertarian Party (United States)#Prostitution|prostitution]],<ref name=\"Eagles Johnston\"/><ref name=\"Libertarian struggle\"/><ref name=\"Co-founder\"/><ref name=\"GALLOWAY Libertarian\"/> [[polygamy]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.azlp.org/platform.php|publisher=Arizona Libertarian Party|title=Home|accessdate=May 5, 2015|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150503140844/http://www.azlp.org/platform.php|archivedate=May 3, 2015|df=mdy-all}}</ref> and [[gambling]],<ref>{{cite book|title=Understanding American Government and Politics|first=Duncan|last=Watts|year=2006|publisher=[[Manchester University Press]]|isbn=978-0-7190-7327-4|page=246|url=https://books.google.com/?id=SIeIARfRc1AC&pg=RA2-PT124}}</ref> supports the removal of restrictions on [[Libertarian Party (United States)#LGBT issues|homosexuality]],<ref name=\"Co-founder\"/> opposes any kind of [[censorship]] and supports [[freedom of speech]],<ref name=\"Freedom of Speech\">{{cite web|url=http://www.lp.org/issues/freedom-of-speech|title=Freedom of Speech|publisher=Libertarian Party|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514110414/http://www.lp.org/issues/freedom-of-speech|archivedate=May 14, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref> and supports the [[right to keep and bear arms]]<ref name=\"Libertarian struggle\"/> while opposing Federal capital punishment.<ref name=\"ontheissues.org\">{{cite web|url=http://www.ontheissues.org/Celeb/Libertarian_Party_Crime.htm|title=Libertarian Party on Crime|work=OnTheIssues.org|date=|accessdate=January 29, 2016}}</ref> The Libertarian Party's platform states: \"Government does not have the authority to define, license or restrict [[personal relationship]]s.

Some, like the group [[Libertarians for Life]], consider abortion to be an act of aggression from the government or mother against a fetus. Others, like the group Pro-Choice Libertarians, consider denying a woman the right to choose abortion to be an act of aggression from the government against her.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pro-choicelibertarians.net/|title=Pro-Choice Libertarians|accessdate=July 12, 2012}}</ref>\n\n==== Crime and capital punishment ====\n{{see also|Libertarian perspectives on capital punishment}}\nShortly before the [[2000 United States presidential election|2000 elections]], the party released a \"Libertarian Party Program on Crime\" in which they criticize the failures of a recently proposed Omnibus Crime Bill, especially detailing how it expands the list of [[capital crime]]s.<ref name=\"ontheissues.org\"/> Denouncing Federal executions, they also describe how the party would increase and safeguard the [[rights of the accused]] in legal settings as well as limit the use of [[excessive force]] by police. Instead, criminal laws would be reduced to violations of the rights of others through either force or fraud with maximum [[restitution]] given to victims of the criminals or negligent persons.<ref name=\"lp.org\"/> In 2016, the party expanded their platform to officially support the repeal of capital punishment.<ref name=\"http://www.lp.org/platform#1.8\">[http://www.lp.org/platform#1.8 \"2016 platform\"].</ref>\n\n==== Freedom of speech and censorship ====\nThe Libertarian Party supports unrestricted freedom of speech and is opposed to any kind of [[censorship]]. The party describes the issue in its website: \"We defend the rights of individuals to unrestricted freedom of speech, [[freedom of the press]] and the right of individuals to [[dissent]] from government itself. [...] We oppose any abridgment of the freedom of speech through government censorship, regulation or control of communications media\". The party claims it is the only political party in the United States \"with an explicit stand against censorship of computer communications in its platform\".<ref name=\"Freedom of Speech\"/>\n\n==== Government reform ====\nThe Libertarian Party favors election systems that are more representative of the [[Electoral district|electorate]] at the [[United States federal government|federal]], state and [[local government|local]] levels. The party platform calls for an end to any tax-financed subsidies to candidates or parties and the repeal of all laws which restrict voluntary financing of election campaigns. As a [[minor party]], it opposes laws that effectively exclude alternative candidates and parties, deny [[ballot access]], [[gerrymander]] districts, or deny the voters their right to consider all legitimate alternatives. Libertarians also promote the use of [[direct democracy]] through the [[referendum]] and [[recall election|recall]] processes.<ref name=\"auto\"/>\n\n==== LGBT issues ====\nThe Libertarian Party advocates repealing all laws that control or prohibit homosexuality.<ref name=calp>{{Cite web|url=http://ca.lp.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Platform-of-the-Libertarian-Party-of-California-as-amended-in-Convention-March-3-2012.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403014848/http://ca.lp.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/Platform-of-the-Libertarian-Party-of-California-as-amended-in-Convention-March-3-2012.pdf|url-status=dead|title=Platform of the Libertarian Party of California as amended in Convention March 3, 2012|archivedate=April 3, 2015}}</ref> According to the Libertarian Party's platform: \"Sexual orientation, preference, gender, or gender identity should have no impact on the government's treatment of individuals, such as in current marriage, child custody, adoption, immigration or military service laws\".<ref name=Platform/>\n\nGay activist Richard Sincere has pointed to the longstanding support of gay rights by the party, which has supported [[same-sex marriage]] since its first platform was drafted in 1972 (40 years before the Democratic Party adopted same-sex marriage into their platform in 2012).

The proposal was incorporated in a new party-wide strategic plan and a joint platform-program committee proposed a reformatted project platform that isolated talking points on issues, principles and solutions as well as an array of projects for adaptation. This platform, along with a short Summary for talking points, was approved in 2004. Confusion arose when prior to the 2006 convention there was a push to repeal or substantially rewrite the Platform, at the center of which were groups such as the Libertarian Reform Caucus.<ref>\"[http://www.reformthelp.org/  Victory in Portland!

It stars [[Robert De Niro]], [[Al Pacino]], and [[Joe Pesci]], with [[Ray Romano]], [[Bobby Cannavale]], [[Anna Paquin]], [[Stephen Graham]], [[Stephanie Kurtzuba]], [[Jesse Plemons]], and [[Harvey Keitel]] in supporting roles. The film follows [[Frank Sheeran]] (De Niro), a truck driver who becomes a hitman involved with mobster [[Russell Bufalino]] (Pesci) and [[Bufalino crime family|his crime family]], including his time working for the powerful [[International Brotherhood of Teamsters|Teamster]] [[Jimmy Hoffa]] (Pacino).\n\nIn September 2014, following years of [[development hell]], ''The Irishman'' was announced as Scorsese's next film after ''[[Silence (2016 film)|Silence]]'' (2016). De Niro, who also served as producer, and Pacino were confirmed that month, as was Pesci, who came out of his unofficial retirement to star after numerous requests. [[Principal photography]] began in September 2017 in New York City and in the [[Mineola, New York|Mineola]] and [[Williston Park]] sections of [[Long Island]], and wrapped in March 2018. Scenes were filmed with a custom three-camera rig to help facilitate the extensive [[De-aging in film|de-aging]] digital effects that made De Niro, Pacino, and Pesci appear younger. With a production budget of $159\u2013200 million and a runtime of 209 minutes, it is the most expensive and longest film of Scorsese's career.\n\n''The Irishman'' premiered at the [[57th New York Film Festival]], and had a [[limited theatrical release]] on November 1, 2019, followed by digital streaming on [[Netflix]] starting on November 27, 2019. It received critical acclaim, with praise for Scorsese's direction and the performances of De Niro, Pacino, and Pesci. The film received [[List of accolades received by The Irishman|numerous accolades]]; at the [[92nd Academy Awards]], it received 10 nominations, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]], [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] for Pacino and Pesci, and [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]]. Additionally, at the [[77th Golden Globe Awards]], it was nominated for five awards, including [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture \u2013 Drama|Best Motion Picture \u2013 Drama]], while it earned 10 nominations at the [[73rd British Academy Film Awards]], including [[BAFTA Award for Best Film|Best Film]].\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Plot ==\n<!--PER MANUAL OF STYLE, PLOT SUMMARIES FOR FEATURE FILMS SHOULD BE BETWEEN 400 AND 700 WORDS-->\nIn a nursing home in his wheelchair, [[Frank Sheeran]], an elderly [[World War II]] veteran, recounts his time as a [[hitman]] for a [[Organized crime|crime syndicate]].\n\nIn 1950s [[Philadelphia]], Sheeran works as a delivery truck driver and starts to sell some of the contents of his shipments to local gangster Skinny Razor, a member of the [[Philadelphia crime family]] headed by [[Angelo Bruno]]. After the company Sheeran works for accuses him of theft, [[Trade union|union]] lawyer [[Bill Bufalino]] gets the case thrown out after Sheeran refuses to name his customers to the judge. Bill introduces Sheeran to his cousin [[Russell Bufalino]], head of the [[Bufalino crime family|Northeastern Pennsylvania crime family]]. Sheeran begins to carry out jobs for Russell, as well as members of the [[South Philadelphia]] underworld, including \"painting houses,\" a euphemism for murder or [[contract killing]]. Soon, Russell introduces Sheeran to [[Jimmy Hoffa]], head of the [[International Brotherhood of Teamsters]], who has financial ties with the Northeastern Pennsylvania crime family and is struggling to deal with fellow rising Teamster [[Anthony Provenzano|Anthony \"Tony Pro\" Provenzano]], as well as mounting pressure from the federal government. Hoffa becomes close with Sheeran and his family, especially his daughter Peggy, and Sheeran becomes Hoffa's chief bodyguard.\n\nAfter the [[1960 United States presidential election|1960 election]] of [[John F. Kennedy]], Russell is thrilled while Hoffa is livid. Kennedy's brother, [[Robert F. Kennedy|Robert Kennedy]], who was named Attorney General, forms a [[United States Senate Select Committee on Improper Activities in Labor and Management#Impact on key participants|\"Get Hoffa\" squad]] in an effort to bring down Hoffa, who is eventually arrested and convicted in 1964 for [[jury tampering]].\n\nWhile Hoffa is in prison, his replacement atop the Teamsters, [[Frank Fitzsimmons|Frank \"Fitz\" Fitzsimmons]], begins overspending the labor union's pension fund and making interest-free loans to the Mafia. Hoffa's relationship with Tony Pro, himself arrested for extortion, also deteriorates beyond repair. Hoffa has his sentence [[Commutation (law)|commuted]] by President [[Richard Nixon]] in 1971, although he is forbidden from partaking in any Teamsters activities until 1980.\n\nDespite his parole terms, Hoffa undertakes a plan to reclaim his power atop the Teamsters. Hoffa's growing disrespect for other Teamster leaders and related crime family interests begins to worry Russell. During a dinner in Sheeran's honor in October 1973, Russell tells Sheeran to confront Hoffa and warn him that the heads of the crime families are displeased with his behavior. Hoffa then informs Sheeran that he \"knows things\" that Russell and the other dons are unaware that he knows, and further claims that he is untouchable, for if anything ever happened to him they would all end up in prison.\n\nIn 1975, while on their way to the wedding of Bill's daughter, Russell tells Sheeran that the dons have become fed up with Hoffa and have sanctioned his murder. Reluctantly, Russell informs Sheeran that he has been chosen as the triggerman, knowing he might otherwise try to warn or save Hoffa. The two drive to an airport where Sheeran boards a plane to [[Detroit]]. Hoffa, who had scheduled a meeting at a local diner with Tony Pro and [[Anthony Giacalone]], is surprised to see Sheeran arrive late with Hoffa's unsuspecting foster son Chuckie O'Brien and gangster Sally Bugs. They advise Hoffa that the meeting was moved to a house where Tony Pro and Russell are waiting for them, and joins them in the car. Entering the house, Hoffa finds it empty and realizes that he has been set up. He turns around to leave at which point Sheeran shoots him twice at [[point-blank range]] before leaving the gun atop his body near the entrance. After Sheeran departs, two younger gangsters have the body cremated to eliminate all traces of him.\n\nAfter [[taking the Fifth]] in a [[Grand juries in the United States|grand jury]] investigation into Hoffa's disappearance, Sheeran, Russell, Tony Pro and others are eventually convicted on various charges unrelated to Hoffa's murder. One by one, the now elderly gangsters begin to die in prison. Sheeran is eventually released and placed in a nursing home. He tries to reconcile with his alienated daughters, but Peggy, suspecting his involvement in Hoffa's disappearance, severs all contact with him. Sheeran begins seeing a Catholic priest assigned to the nursing home who gives Sheeran [[Absolution#Roman Catholic Church|absolution]] for crimes committed over his lifetime. As the priest leaves, Sheeran asks him to leave the door slightly ajar, emulating one of Hoffa's habits.\n\n== Cast ==\n<!--ACCORDING TO THE END CREDITS OF THE FILM per WP:FILMCAST-->\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Robert De Niro]] as [[Frank Sheeran]]\n* [[Al Pacino]] as [[Jimmy Hoffa]]\n* [[Joe Pesci]] as [[Russell Bufalino]]\n* [[Ray Romano]] as [[Bill Bufalino]]\n* [[Bobby Cannavale]] as Skinny Razor\n* [[Anna Paquin]] as Older Peggy Sheeran\n** Lucy Gallina as Young Peggy Sheeran\n* [[Stephen Graham]] as [[Anthony Provenzano|Anthony \"Tony Pro\" Provenzano]]\n* [[Harvey Keitel]] as [[Angelo Bruno]]\n* [[Stephanie Kurtzuba]] as Irene Sheeran\n* [[Kathrine Narducci]] as Carrie Bufalino\n* Welker White as Josephine \"Jo\" Hoffa\n* [[Jesse Plemons]] as Chuckie O'Brien\n* [[Jack Huston]] as [[Robert F.

This one actually started about 35 years ago with the idea of the remake of ''[[The Bad and the Beautiful]]'' and the sequel ''[[Two Weeks in Another Town]]''. Somehow we exhausted that.\"<ref name=\"1980s\" /> Afterwards, Scorsese approached De Niro with an idea to do an aging hitman story, which did not move forward.<ref name=\"BTS\" /> [[Robert De Niro|De Niro]] then revived that old discussion and \"got the project underway\" after reading a copy of the 2004 book ''[[I Heard You Paint Houses]]'' written by [[Charles Brandt]],<ref name=\"DeNiroBook\" /> with Scorsese saying that De Niro \"became rather emotional\" as he told him about the lead character.<ref name=\"SpikeLee\" /> Scorsese then became interested in directing a film adaptation of the book and in casting De Niro, [[Al Pacino]], and [[Joe Pesci]].<ref name=\"ScorseseInterested\" />\n\n''The Irishman'' started its development phase in 2007.<ref name=\"Variety\" /><ref name=\"Rosenthal\" /> New plot materials and rewrites caused the movie to lose its place in the film release calendar, and Scorsese went on to direct three more films, ''[[Hugo (film)|Hugo]]'' (2011), ''[[The Wolf of Wall Street (2013 film)|The Wolf of Wall Street]]'' (2013) and ''[[Silence (2016 film)|Silence]]'' (2016), before returning to ''The Irishman''.<ref name=\"Brandt\" /> In September 2014, after years of [[development hell]],<ref name=\"Variety\" /> Pacino confirmed that the film would be Scorsese's next project after ''Silence''.<ref name=\"PacinoStillHappening\" /> In October 2015, De Niro stated that the film was still happening and could have started filming in 2016 with Steven Zaillian confirmed as screenwriter.<ref name=\"DeNiroConfirmed\" /><ref name=\"ZaillianConfirmed\" /> In July 2017, it was reported that the film would be presented as a series of flashbacks of an older Frank Sheeran, depicted as recollecting his many criminal activities over several decades,<ref name=\"Writing\" /> with De Niro appearing \"as young as 24 years and as old as 80.\"<ref name=\"2015Test\" /> Producer [[Irwin Winkler]] defined the project as \"the coming together of people that have worked together since we're kids together\",<ref name=\"Winkler\" /> while Rosenthal said that \"what will surprise you is, as a Scorsese movie, it is a slower movie [...] it is guys looking at themselves through an older perspective.\"<ref name=\"Rosenthal\" />\n\n=== Financing and budget ===\nIn May 2016, Mexican production company [[F\u00e1brica de Cine]] had offered $100 million to finance the film, and through that deal [[Paramount Pictures]] would retain domestic rights.<ref name=\"Financing1\" /> [[IM Global]] was also circling to bid for the film's international sales rights.<ref name=\"Financing1\" /> [[STX Entertainment]] bought the international distribution rights to the film for $50 million beating out other studios like [[Universal Pictures]], [[20th Century Fox]], and [[Lionsgate]], while F\u00e1brica de Cine closed the deal and Paramount retained its domestic rights.<ref name=\"Financing2\" /><ref name=\"Financing3\" />\n\nBy February 2017, Paramount Pictures had dropped domestic distribution rights for ''The Irishman'' following the announcement that F\u00e1brica de Cine would not be financing the film due to its climbing budget. [[Netflix]] then bought the film rights for $105 million and agreed to finance the film's $125 million budget with a projected release date of October 2019.<ref name=\"105EstimatedBudget\" /><ref name=\"125EstimatedBudget\" /> In March 2018, it was also reported the film's budget had ballooned from $125 million to $140 million, due in large part to the visual effects needed to make De Niro, Pacino, and Pesci appear younger at various points throughout the film.<ref name=\"140EstimatedBudget\" /> By August of that year, speculation had arisen that the cost had reportedly risen to as much as $175 million by the time post-production was to have wrapped, and some publications asserted that it might go as high as $200 million.<ref name=\"Independent\" /><ref name=\"200EstimatedBudget\" /> In August 2019, it was reported that the film's official cost was $159 million, although it has been occasionally been noted as $173 million or even as high as the $200 million figure.<ref name=\"ReutersBudget\" /><ref name=\"LosAngelesTimesBudget\" /><ref name=\"DeadlineSoldOut\" /><ref name=\"WSJBudget\" />\n\n=== Writing ===\nIn July 2009, Brandt received a phone call from De Niro that led to a meeting a month later between the two of them, Scorsese and screenwriter Steven Zaillian.<ref name=\"Brandt\" /> The meeting was supposed to last an hour but ended up lasting four hours. Brandt said that \"the material was new to them\" and Zaillian already had a script ready, but the additions Brandt made required a do-over. To help, Brandt handed over a screenplay of his own. Brandt said, \"Zaillian is a great writer, don't get me wrong [...] I wanted to log the material.\"<ref name=\"Brandt\" /> In the opening credits and as a reflection of the writing adaptation process, the final film is titled ''I Heard You Paint Houses'', the name of the [[I Heard You Paint Houses|novel on which the picture is based]], while the title ''The Irishman'' only appears in the end credits.<ref name=\"OnScreenTitle\" />\n\nThe truthfulness of Sheeran's supposed confessions and the book on which the film was based has been challenged by \"The Lies of the Irishman\", an article on ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' by Bill Tonelli,<ref name=\"Tonelli\" /> as well as by \"Jimmy Hoffa and The Irishman: A True Crime Story?\" by [[Harvard Law School]] professor [[Jack Goldsmith]], which appeared in ''[[The New York Review of Books]]''.<ref name=\"Goldsmith\" /> Chip Fleischer, the publisher of ''I Heard You Paint Houses'', wrote a detailed reply to Tonelli's piece, calling it \"irresponsible in the extreme, not to mention damaging.\"<ref name=\"PublisherReply\" /> In an interview, De Niro defended the writing process of the film by stating, \"we're not saying we're telling the actual story [...] we're telling our story.\"<ref name=\"DeNiroResponse\" />\n\n=== Casting ===\n[[File:Harvey Keitel Cannes 2015.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Harvey Keitel]] portrayed the mob boss [[Angelo Bruno]].]]\nIn July 2017, Pacino and Pesci officially joined the cast, with [[Ray Romano]] also joining and [[Bobby Cannavale]] and [[Harvey Keitel]] in final negotiations.<ref name=\"PacinoStillHappening\" /> Pesci was offered his role a reported 50 times before agreeing to take part, at first saying he did not want to do \"the gangster thing again\", while Scorsese tried to persuade him ''The Irishman'' would be \"different.\"<ref name=\"SpikeLee\" /> De Niro played a big part in convincing Pesci to take the role, telling him \"We gotta do this. Who knows if there'll be anything after?\"<ref name=\"Empire\" /> In September 2017, [[Jack Huston]],<ref name=\"Cast1\" /> [[Stephen Graham]],<ref name=\"Cast2\" /> [[Domenick Lombardozzi]], [[Jeremy Luke]], Joseph Russo,<ref name=\"LombardozziConfirmed\" /> [[Kathrine Narducci]],<ref name=\"Cast3\" /> Danny Abeckaser,<ref name=\"Cast4\" /> [[J. C. MacKenzie]], and Craig Vincent<ref name=\"Cast5\" /> joined the cast. In October, [[Gary Basaraba]],<ref name=\"BarasabaConfirmed\" /> [[Anna Paquin]],<ref name=\"PaquinConfirmed\" /> Welker White,<ref name=\"WhiteConfirmed\" /> and [[Jesse Plemons]] joined the cast of the film. Later, Craig Di Francia and [[Action Bronson]] were revealed to have joined the cast.<ref name=\"DiFranciaConfirmed\" /><ref name=\"BronsonConfirmed\" /> [[Sebastian Maniscalco]] and [[Paul Ben-Victor]] were later revealed as being part of the cast.<ref name=\"ManiscalcoConfirmed\" /><ref name=\"Ben-VictorConfirmed\" />\n\n''The Irishman'' is the [[Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro|ninth feature collaboration between De Niro and Scorsese]] and their first since 1995's ''[[Casino (1995 film)|Casino]]''; the fourth film to star both De Niro and Pacino (following ''[[The Godfather Part II]]'', ''[[Heat (1995 film)|Heat]],'' and ''[[Righteous Kill]]''); the seventh to star both De Niro and Pesci (following ''[[Raging Bull]]'', ''[[Once Upon a Time in America]]'', ''[[Goodfellas]]'', ''[[A Bronx Tale]]'', ''Casino'', and ''[[The Good Shepherd (film)|The Good Shepherd]]''); the first to star both Pacino and Pesci; and the first time Pacino has been directed by Scorsese. Scorsese said of finally working with Pacino, \"I'd been wanting to work with Al for years. [[Francis Ford Coppola|Francis Coppola]] introduced me to him in 1970. Then he's in [[The Godfather|''The Godfather'' one]] and two, and he's in the stratosphere. For me, Al was always something unreachable. We even tried to make a film in the 1980s but couldn't get the financing for it. I said, 'What's he like to work with?' Bob [De Niro] said, 'Oh, he's great. You'll see.'\" Scorsese added that there is a meta aspect to seeing Pacino and De Niro interact in ''The Irishman'', saying, \"What you see in the film is their relationship as actors, as friends, over the past 40, 45 years. There's something magical that happens there.\"<ref name=\"ScorsesePacino\" />\n\n=== Filming ===\n[[Principal photography]] was originally set to start in August 2017, in and around [[New York City]],<ref name=\"Filming2\" /><ref name=\"NewYorkPost\" /> and would continue through December 2017.<ref name=\"FilmingDuration\" /><ref name=\"RomanoConfirmed\" /> Instead, filming began on September 18, 2017 in New York City and in the [[Mineola, New York|Mineola]] and [[Williston Park]] sections of [[Long Island]],<ref name=\"Filming1\" /><ref name=\"FilmingStart\" /><ref name=\"FilmingInNewYork\" /> and wrapped on March 5, 2018, for a total of 108 days.<ref name=\"Wrapped\" /><ref name=\"Empire\" /> Additional scenes were filmed in the [[Hudson Valley]] in [[Salisbury Mills, New York|Salisbury Mills]] and [[Suffern, New York|Suffern]], among other sites, including [[Paterson, New Jersey]].<ref name=\"Filming3\" /><ref name=\"Paterson\" /><ref name=\"Filming4\" /> A posture coach was hired to instruct De Niro, Pacino, and Pesci on how to comport themselves like much younger men.<ref name=\"Empire\" /> The picture was primarily shot on [[35 mm movie film]] with [[Arricam]] ST and LT, and with [[Red Digital Cinema|RED Helium]] for sections shot on digital, with two IR-capable Alexa Mini as witness-cameras for the de-aging.<ref name=\"Cameras1\" /><ref name=\"Cameras2\" /> All scenes that required de-aging effects were shot digitally with a custom [[Multiple-camera setup|three-camera rig]].<ref name=\"Cameras1\" />\n\nScorsese envisioned the film as having an \"old-fashioned\" look which cinematographer [[Rodrigo Prieto]] accomplished by using \"a series of [[3D lookup table|lookup tables]]\" for each scene. Sherlock summarized the filming approach used for each historical decade depicted throughout the film, stating: \"The '50s-set scenes have a Kodachrome look; the '60s-set scenes have an Ektachrome look; the '70s-set scenes have a silvery layer plastered over them; and any scene set in the '80s and onwards have a 'bleach bypass' look, and are also more de-saturated than the other scenes.\"<ref name=\"BTS\" /> The extensive [[Production designer|production design]] covered 117 filming locations, 319 scenes, 160 actors, in a story spanning 50 years. Producer, Emma Tillinger Koskoff, summarized her relation to Scorsese and his principal crew stating: \"I also work closely with the line producer, AD [Assistant Director] and DP [Director of Photography] on a budget and schedule, and we create a production plan that will realize Marty's vision... We scouted a lot. Our prep was almost six months; sometimes we were scouting after the day's wrap, trying to find new location... due to weather or whatever; it was pretty insane.\"<ref name=\"MegaProduction\" />\n\n[[Sandy Powell (costume designer)|Sandy Powell]] and Christopher Peterson were costume designer and co-designer, respectively. Speaking about Scorsese, Powell said, \"one of the things he said on a first meeting was that we weren't doing the same kind of gangsters as ''Goodfellas'' or ''Casino'' [...] these weren't flashy peacock looks. We were doing a low-key version. I mean, there are some obvious mafia types in there, but half of that is the way these people hold themselves.\" The film had a total of \"250 characters and 6,500 extras\", said Peterson, with Powell adding that \"you need a lot of research, a lot of hard work, and you need to just get down and do it, [...] you basically have to sort of divide your brain up into those five different decades, and approach it as if there are three or four films in one. You're filming more than one decade in one day, and that's when you'd have to really know what you were doing.\"<ref name=\"CostumeDesign\" />\n\nBill Desowitz, writing for ''[[IndieWire]]'', stated that the film had been considered as contending for an Oscar nomination for its editing. Editor, [[Thelma Schoonmaker]] commented on the editing of the film stating: \"Marty wanted to show the banality of the violence... It's not like the incredible camera moves or flashy editing of the earlier movies. Victims are killed in an instant \u2014 often in very simple wide shots. And his brilliant idea of slamming the titles in front of the audience (describing how various mob characters die) was a way of showing that being part of the Mafia is not a good idea\".<ref name=\"Editing\" />\n\n=== Visual effects ===\n{{Quote box\n|quote = There's a great deal of [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] because we're doing this youthification of De Niro, Pesci, and Al Pacino. They had to be CGI [...] Why I'm concerned, we're all concerned is that we're so used to watching them as the older faces. When we put them all together, it cuts back and forth [...] Now, it's real. Now, I'm seeing it. Now, certain shots need more work on the eyes, need more work on why these exactly the same eyes from the plate shot, but the wrinkles and things have changed. Does it change the eyes at all? If that's the case, what was in the eyes that I liked? Was it intensity? Was it gravitas?

Scorsese said that \"the risk was there, and that was it. We just tried to make the film.

He's going to want to be in the moment with Joe Pesci and Al Pacino on set, with no markers on him. So, if you're going to capture the performance, how are you going to do that?\"<ref name=\"HolyGrail\" /> Scenes that required the de-aging [[visual effects]] were shot digitally with a custom three-camera rig.<ref name=\"Cameras1\" /> Helman and his team had spent two years analyzing old films to determine how the actors should look at various ages.<ref name=\"HolyGrail\" />\n\nIn March 2018, speaking about the de-aging process, Pacino told ''IndieWire'', \"I was playing Jimmy Hoffa at the age of 39, they're doing that on a computer [...] we went through all these tests and things [...] someone would come up to me and say, 'You're 39.'

Nielsen also noted that the largest number of viewers to watch the film in its entirety (930,000) came on November 29, and its opening day demo was made up mostly of men aged 50\u201364 (20%), while they also made up an overall 15% of the viewership over the five-day period.<ref name=NetflixViewers /> Several days later, Netflix's [[chief content officer]] [[Ted Sarandos]] announced that a total of 26.4 million accounts worldwide had watched at least 70% of the film, meaning that about 16% of all Netflix account holders watched the film during its first week of release.<ref name=\"NetflixViewers2\" /> It was the fourth most watched Netflix film of 2019, and the fifth most popular Netflix release overall.<ref name=\"NetflixPopular\" />\n\n=== Limited theatrical release ===\n[[File:CMiks - The Irishman table - CCA 2020 01 12.jpg|thumb|Al Pacino and Robert De Niro during the [[25th Critics' Choice Awards]] in Santa Monica, California on January 12, 2020.]]\n==== United States ====\n''The Irishman'' received a limited theatrical release on November 1, 2019 in the United States.<ref name=\"ReleaseDate\" /> As part of the continuing tensions between the film markets for direct-to-digital streaming and theatrical releases and distribution of films, several theater chains protested the policy of Netflix for the release of Scorsese's ''The Irishman''. The film did not play at the theaters owned by [[AMC Theatres|AMC]], [[Cinemark Theatres|Cinemark]], [[Regal Cinemas|Regal]] or [[Cineplex Entertainment|Cineplex]], because the \"four week progression to [[Subscription video on demand|SVOD]] remains unacceptable to those chains.\"<ref name=\"ReleaseDate\" /> It was previously reported in February 2019 that Netflix would possibly give the film a wide theatrical release, at the request of Scorsese.<ref name=\"PossibleWideRelease1\" /> The heads of several theater chains, including AMC's [[Adam Aron]], who refused to play ''[[Roma (2018 film)|Roma]]'' the previous November, said they would only be open to playing ''The Irishman'' if Netflix \"respects the decades old theatrical window, that suggests that movies come to theaters first for a couple of months, and then go to the home.\"<ref name=\"PossibleWideRelease2\" /> Two major chains offered to exhibit the film if given an exclusivity window of 60 days, approximately two weeks shorter than the typical window, but could not reach an agreement with Netflix.<ref name=\"TheaterChains\" /> The film peaked at playing in 500 theaters, essentially the most possible without the involvement of a major chain.<ref name=\"FifthWeekend\" />\n\n==== Other countries ====\nIn the United Kingdom, [[Altitude Film Distribution]] launched the film through the [[Everyman Cinemas|Everyman]] and [[Curzon Cinemas|Curzon]] cinema chains, where the film was shown on about 80 screens, while other British cinema chains, including [[Picturehouse Cinemas|Picturehouse]], [[Vue Cinemas|Vue]], and [[Odeon Cinemas|Odeon]], turned down the film in order to uphold the 90-day window that was standard practice across much of Europe.<ref name=\"BiggestRelease\" /> In [[Italy]], ''The Irishman'' played on about 100 screens via [[Cineteca di Bologna]], the same distributor that released ''Roma'' in 2018 and caused an uproar among Italian exhibitors, but no similar protests have occurred over ''The Irishman''.<ref name=\"BiggestRelease\" /> The film also received limited releases in Germany, Spain, Ireland, Japan, Brazil, South Korea, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. The film did not play in France because of the country's 30-month window between a film's theatrical release and its availability on TV and other outlets.

The magazine also argued that had the film gone wide theatrically, it likely would have become a [[box office bomb]] given its 209-minute runtime and large budget, noting that another period crime film with a long runtime that opened the same weekend, ''[[Motherless Brooklyn (film)|Motherless Brooklyn]]'', failed to meet its projections.<ref name=\"DeadlineSoldOut\" /> Conversely, [[CNBC]] wrote that Netflix was \"leaving millions on the table\" by not giving the film a wide theatrical release, and claimed it could have legged out to at least $100 million at the domestic box office, citing the high demand for tickets during its opening weekend (with some reselling for $65\u201385) and that Scorsese's last gangster film, ''[[The Departed]]'', made $132 million in 2006.<ref name=\"CNBC-BO\" />\n\nExpanding to 22 theaters in its second weekend, the film made an estimated $440,000, for a ten-day running total of about $940,000.<ref name=\"SecondWeekend\" /> It then grossed an estimated $1.25 million from 175 theaters in its third week,<ref name=\"ThirdWeekend\" /> and $1.2 million from 200 in its fourth.<ref name=\"FourthWeekend\" /> Despite being released on Netflix on November 27, the film expanded to 500 theaters in its fifth weekend, \"close to the maximum number with most top theater chains refusing to let their customers have a chance to see it in theaters despite the acclaim and interest\", and made an estimated $1 million.<ref name=\"FifthWeekend\" /> It then made an estimated $450,000 from 320 theaters in its sixth weekend \u2014 likely becoming Netflix's most successful theatrical release to-date with a running total of $6.7 million \u2014 and then $100,000 from 70 theaters in its seventh.<ref name=\"SixthWeekend\" /><ref name=\"SeventhWeekend\" /> Through its eighth and ninth weekend,<ref name=\"EighthWeekend\" /> the film was reduced to minimal theater play.<ref name=\"NinthWeekend\" /> ''The Irishman'' grossed an estimated $7 million in North America and $968,683 in other territories, for a worldwide total of $8 million.<ref name=\"EighthWeekend\" /><ref name=\"BOM\" />\n\n=== Critical response ===\n{{multiple image|total_width=400\n|image1 = Robert De Niro 2 by David Shankbone.jpg\n|width1 = 600\n|height1 = 700\n|image2 = Al Pacino.jpg\n|width2 = 600\n|height2 = 700\n|image3 = JoePesci-2009.jpg\n|width3 = 600\n|height3 = 700\n|footer = The performances of (left to right) [[Robert De Niro]], [[Al Pacino]], and [[Joe Pesci]] garnered critical acclaim, with the latter two being nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]].\n}}\n\nOn [[review aggregator]] [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds an approval rating of 96% based on 421 reviews, with an average rating of 8.77/10.

think that's all it's going to be\" and that \"its last half-hour is deeply moving in a way that creeps up on you, and it's then that you see what Scorsese was working toward all along\"; she also added that \"the de-aging is distracting at first [...] but the special effects are hardly a deal breaker, and in the end they probably add to the movie's mythological vibe.\"<ref name=\"TIMEReview\" /> Similarly, [[Owen Gleiberman]] of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' called it \"a coldly enthralling, long-form knockout \u2014 a majestic Mob epic with ice in its veins\", particularly praising Pacino's performance as \"the film's most extraordinary.\"<ref name=\"VarietyReview\" /> ''[[RogerEbert.com]]''{{'}}s [[Matt Zoller Seitz]] gave the film three and a half stars out of four, defining Scorsese as \"one of the greatest living, though still largely unsung, comedy directors\" and also praised the editing of Thelma Schoonmaker.<ref name=\"RogerEbert.comReview\" />\n\nBenjamin Lee of ''[[The Guardian]]'' wrote that in the film \"there's an almost meta-maturity, as if Scorsese is also looking back on his own career, the film leaving us with a haunting reminder not to glamorise violent men and the wreckage they leave behind.\"<ref name=\"TheGuardianReview\" /> Mike Ryan of ''[[Uproxx]]'' called it a \"phenomenal film\", stating that the de-aging is \"pretty good\" and \"the best I've seen so far\", but noted that \"if you stare at it, yes, you can see the imperfections [...] but you do get used to it\",<ref name=\"UproxxReview\" /> while Johnny Oleksinski of the ''[[New

unexpectedly deep themes for mafiosos.\"<ref name=\"NewYorkPostReview\" /> ''IndieWire''{{'}}s Eric Kohn stated that \"''The Irishman'' is Martin Scorsese's best crime movie since ''[[Goodfellas]]'', and a pure, unbridled illustration of what has made his filmmaking voice so distinctive for nearly 50 years\", reserving particular praise for Steven Zaillian's screenplay, writing that \"Zaillian hasn't delivered a script this polished since ''[[Moneyball (film)|Moneyball]]''.\"<ref name=\"IndieWireReview\" /> [[David Edelstein]] wrote for ''[[New York (magazine)|Vulture]]'' that \"Pesci [...] plays Bufalino as almost supernaturally focused and watchful, always hypersensitive to other peoples' rhythms [...] I thank the gods of acting that he came out of retirement to do this.\" He also praised the performances of De Niro and Pacino, stating that ''The Irishman'' is one of Scorsese's \"most satisfying films in decades.\"<ref name=\"VultureReview\" /> Writing for ''[[TheWrap]]'', [[Alonso Duralde]] praised Rodrigo Prieto's cinematography and Scorsese's direction, writing that \"at the age of 76, Scorsese is embracing new technologies with the fervor of [[Ang Lee]] [...] and indulging in retro fantasy with the keen eye of [[Quentin Tarantino]].\"<ref name=\"TheWrapReview\" /> Nicholas Rapold of ''[[Film Comment]]'', gave the de-aging [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] approach used in the filming a mixed assessment, stating that: \"De Niro's rosy complexion as a truck driver 'kid' recalls a tinted postcard photo more than a twentysomething person, and I can't explain away the same de-aged De Niro curb-stomping a grocer, looking more like the septuagenarian star he is than a ferociously protective thirtysomething dad.\"<ref name=\"Rapold\" />\n\nWhile giving a positive review, David Rooney of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' criticized the running time, stating that \"the excessive length ultimately is a weakness\" and \"that the material would have been better served by losing an hour or more to run at standard feature length.\"<ref name=\"TheHollywoodReporterReview\" /> Writing for the ''[[National Review]]'', [[Kyle Smith]] gave a more critical review, saying that \"while it's a good film, it isn't a great one\" and also commented that \"[''The Irishman''] could easily be trimmed by 30 minutes or more by tightening up the midsection.\"<ref name=\"NationalReviewReview\" /> Conversely, [[Richard Brody]] of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' wrote \"it runs a minute shy of three and a half hours, and I wouldn't wish it any shorter\",<ref name=\"TheNewYorkerReview\" /> and Karen Han of ''[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]'' said that \"Scorsese is so adept at storytelling, and his cast is so unbelievable, that the film [...] barely feels its length.\"<ref name=\"PolygonReview\" />\n\n''The Irishman'' also garnered acclaim from a number of filmmakers, whom listed the film as one of their favorites of 2019, including [[Ana Lily Amirpour]], [[Olivier Assayas]], [[Bong Joon-ho]], [[Guillermo del Toro]], [[Luca Guadagnino]], [[Ciro Guerra]], [[Bill Hader]], [[Don Hertzfeldt]], [[Alejandro Landes]], [[Alex Ross Perry]], [[Paul Schrader]], [[Adam Wingard]], and Quentin Tarantino, who ranked it as his favorite of the year.<ref name=\"Filmmakers\" /><ref name=\"Tarantino\" /> Del Toro commented on the film in a [[Twitter|tweet]], by comparing it to [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s ''[[Barry Lyndon]]'' and praised the cast performances, especially, Pesci, calling him \"supremely minimalistic\" and \"masterful\" and he went on to define ''The Irishman'' as a \"masterpiece\" and \"the perfect corollary [to] ''[[Goodfellas]]'' and ''[[Casino (1995 film)|Casino]]''.\"<ref name=\"delToroDuVernay\" /> [[Edgar Wright]] wrote, \"''The Irishman'' [...] feels like a riposte to the imitators of ''Goodfellas'' who revel only in the parts about the 'glamour' of the business. This film coldly makes the point that this way of life leads only to death, inside and out.\"<ref name=\"Wright\" /> [[Ava DuVernay]] also praised the film, writing: \"running time is 3 hours and some change. For me, it flew by [...] A film made by a filmmaker who feels free. Who has all the tools. All the time. All the talent. And lives up to it. Wow.\"<ref name=\"delToroDuVernay\" /> [[Leonardo DiCaprio]], a [[Martin Scorsese and Leonardo DiCaprio|frequent Scorsese collaborator]], complimented the film at the 2019 [[Santa Barbara International Film Festival]], saying, \"It plays like an elegy. It's a movie about looking upon what you've left behind and squaring up with all of it, but for me, what's more astounding about this film, in my mind, Marty [Scorsese] transcends his own signature genre and creates a film that methodically transforms itself into an exploration of our very own universally shared mortality.

After comparing the film to [[David Cronenberg]]'s ''[[A History of Violence]]'', Rapold stated: \"Frank is not [[psychopathic]], but [[sociopathic]]. Whichever the case, one might ask how unusual Frank in ''The Irishman'' is meant to be. Oddly enough, people in recent years have been spending quite a bit of their spare time watching killers, and in situations outside the usual context of law enforcement. Watching or rewatching assorted acclaimed TV series, I couldn't help noticing how many zero in on people for whom killing is routine: ''[[The Sopranos]]'', ''[[The Americans]]'', ''[[Barry (TV series)|Barry]]'', ''[[Mindhunter (TV series)|Mindhunter]]'', ''[[Killing Eve]]'', ''[[Dexter (TV series)|Dexter]]''. (There's also the apocalyptic strand in which almost everyone has already died, like ''[[The Leftovers (TV series)|The Leftovers]]'', or everyone is dead, like ''[[The Good Place]]'', or in the niche case of ''[[Russian Doll (TV series)|Russian Doll]]'', one person keeps dying.) Very often these shows return to the hollowing-out that is felt through the destruction of human life and through the maintenance of the double life required to insulate that pursuit\".<ref name=\"Rapold\" />\n\n[[Richard Brody]], writing for ''The New Yorker'', found the film to be a dark allegory of American politics and American society, stating: \"The real-life Hoffa [was] a crucial player in both gangland politics and the actual practical politics of the day, and the movie's key through line is the inseparability of those two realms. ''The Irishman'' is a sociopolitical horror story that views much of modern American history as a continuous crime in motion, in which every level of society\u2014from domestic life through local business through big business through national and international politics\u2014is poisoned by graft and bribery, shady deals and dirty money, threats of violence and its gruesome enactment, and the hard-baked impunity that keeps the entire system running\".<ref name=\"Brody\" />\n\nIn his extended comments on ''The Irishman'', [[Guillermo del Toro]] found the thematic content of the film and its depiction of character development to be comparable to the films of \"Renoir, Bresson, Bergman, Oliveira or Kurosawa.\" Using cinematic techniques involving interconnected flashbacks and flashforwards, del Toro found Scorsese's juxtaposition of the \"ruthless gangster\" depicted in Frank Sheeran with his \"diminished, elderly self\" as compelling depictions of where \"oblivion reigns supreme\". Del Toro's thematic emphasis, as he attributes it to Scorsese, is the portrayal of the demise of Sheeran in the frailty of his old age as overshadowing the ruthless and relentless accumulation of his criminal activities which defined his more youthful years, with old age transforming Sheeran into a forgotten shadow of his former self.<ref name=\"delToro\" />\n\n== References

It stars [[Robert De Niro]], [[Al Pacino]], and [[Joe Pesci]], with [[Ray Romano]], [[Bobby Cannavale]], [[Anna Paquin]], [[Stephen Graham]], [[Stephanie Kurtzuba]], [[Jesse Plemons]], and [[Harvey Keitel]] in supporting roles. The film follows [[Frank Sheeran]] (De Niro), a truck driver who becomes a hitman involved with mobster [[Russell Bufalino]] (Pesci) and [[Bufalino crime family|his crime family]], including his time working for the powerful [[International Brotherhood of Teamsters|Teamster]] [[Jimmy Hoffa]] (Pacino).\n\nIn September 2014, following years of [[development hell]], ''The Irishman'' was announced as Scorsese's next film after ''[[Silence (2016 film)|Silence]]'' (2016). De Niro, who also served as producer, and Pacino were confirmed that month, as was Pesci, who came out of his unofficial retirement to star after numerous requests. [[Principal photography]] began in September 2017 in New York City and in the [[Mineola, New York|Mineola]] and [[Williston Park]] sections of [[Long Island]], and wrapped in March 2018. Scenes were filmed with a custom three-camera rig to help facilitate the extensive [[De-aging in film|de-aging]] digital effects that made De Niro, Pacino, and Pesci appear younger. With a production budget of $159\u2013200 million and a runtime of 209 minutes, it is the most expensive and longest film of Scorsese's career.\n\n''The Irishman'' premiered at the [[57th New York Film Festival]], and had a [[limited theatrical release]] on November 1, 2019, followed by digital streaming on [[Netflix]] starting on November 27, 2019. It received critical acclaim, with praise for Scorsese's direction and the performances of De Niro, Pacino, and Pesci. The film received [[List of accolades received by The Irishman|numerous accolades]]; at the [[92nd Academy Awards]], it received 10 nominations, including [[Academy Award for Best Picture|Best Picture]], [[Academy Award for Best Director|Best Director]], [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor|Best Supporting Actor]] for Pacino and Pesci, and [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]]. Additionally, at the [[77th Golden Globe Awards]], it was nominated for five awards, including [[Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture \u2013 Drama|Best Motion Picture \u2013 Drama]], while it earned 10 nominations at the [[73rd British Academy Film Awards]], including [[BAFTA Award for Best Film|Best Film]].\n{{TOC limit|3}}\n\n== Plot ==\n<!--PER MANUAL OF STYLE, PLOT SUMMARIES FOR FEATURE FILMS SHOULD BE BETWEEN 400 AND 700 WORDS-->\nIn a nursing home in his wheelchair, [[Frank Sheeran]], an elderly [[World War II]] veteran, recounts his time as a [[hitman]] for a [[Organized crime|crime syndicate]].\n\nIn 1950s [[Philadelphia]], Sheeran works as a delivery truck driver and starts to sell some of the contents of his shipments to local gangster Skinny Razor, a member of the [[Philadelphia crime family]] headed by [[Angelo Bruno]]. After the company Sheeran works for accuses him of theft, [[Trade union|union]] lawyer [[Bill Bufalino]] gets the case thrown out after Sheeran refuses to name his customers to the judge. Bill introduces Sheeran to his cousin [[Russell Bufalino]], head of the [[Bufalino crime family|Northeastern Pennsylvania crime family]]. Sheeran begins to carry out jobs for Russell, as well as members of the [[South Philadelphia]] underworld, including \"painting houses,\" a euphemism for murder or [[contract killing]]. Soon, Russell introduces Sheeran to [[Jimmy Hoffa]], head of the [[International Brotherhood of Teamsters]], who has financial ties with the Northeastern Pennsylvania crime family and is struggling to deal with fellow rising Teamster [[Anthony Provenzano|Anthony \"Tony Pro\" Provenzano]], as well as mounting pressure from the federal government. Hoffa becomes close with Sheeran and his family, especially his daughter Peggy, and Sheeran becomes Hoffa's chief bodyguard.\n\nAfter the [[1960 United States presidential election|1960 election]] of [[John F. Kennedy]], Russell is thrilled while Hoffa is livid. Kennedy's brother, [[Robert F. Kennedy|Robert Kennedy]], who was named Attorney General, forms a [[United States Senate Select Committee on Improper Activities in Labor and Management#Impact on key participants|\"Get Hoffa\" squad]] in an effort to bring down Hoffa, who is eventually arrested and convicted in 1964 for [[jury tampering]].\n\nWhile Hoffa is in prison, his replacement atop the Teamsters, [[Frank Fitzsimmons|Frank \"Fitz\" Fitzsimmons]], begins overspending the labor union's pension fund and making interest-free loans to the Mafia. Hoffa's relationship with Tony Pro, himself arrested for extortion, also deteriorates beyond repair. Hoffa has his sentence [[Commutation (law)|commuted]] by President [[Richard Nixon]] in 1971, although he is forbidden from partaking in any Teamsters activities until 1980.\n\nDespite his parole terms, Hoffa undertakes a plan to reclaim his power atop the Teamsters. Hoffa's growing disrespect for other Teamster leaders and related crime family interests begins to worry Russell. During a dinner in Sheeran's honor in October 1973, Russell tells Sheeran to confront Hoffa and warn him that the heads of the crime families are displeased with his behavior. Hoffa then informs Sheeran that he \"knows things\" that Russell and the other dons are unaware that he knows, and further claims that he is untouchable, for if anything ever happened to him they would all end up in prison.\n\nIn 1975, while on their way to the wedding of Bill's daughter, Russell tells Sheeran that the dons have become fed up with Hoffa and have sanctioned his murder. Reluctantly, Russell informs Sheeran that he has been chosen as the triggerman, knowing he might otherwise try to warn or save Hoffa. The two drive to an airport where Sheeran boards a plane to [[Detroit]]. Hoffa, who had scheduled a meeting at a local diner with Tony Pro and [[Anthony Giacalone]], is surprised to see Sheeran arrive late with Hoffa's unsuspecting foster son Chuckie O'Brien and gangster Sally Bugs. They advise Hoffa that the meeting was moved to a house where Tony Pro and Russell are waiting for them, and joins them in the car. Entering the house, Hoffa finds it empty and realizes that he has been set up. He turns around to leave at which point Sheeran shoots him twice at [[point-blank range]] before leaving the gun atop his body near the entrance. After Sheeran departs, two younger gangsters have the body cremated to eliminate all traces of him.\n\nAfter [[taking the Fifth]] in a [[Grand juries in the United States|grand jury]] investigation into Hoffa's disappearance, Sheeran, Russell, Tony Pro and others are eventually convicted on various charges unrelated to Hoffa's murder. One by one, the now elderly gangsters begin to die in prison. Sheeran is eventually released and placed in a nursing home. He tries to reconcile with his alienated daughters, but Peggy, suspecting his involvement in Hoffa's disappearance, severs all contact with him. Sheeran begins seeing a Catholic priest assigned to the nursing home who gives Sheeran [[Absolution#Roman Catholic Church|absolution]] for crimes committed over his lifetime. As the priest leaves, Sheeran asks him to leave the door slightly ajar, emulating one of Hoffa's habits.\n\n== Cast ==\n<!--ACCORDING TO THE END CREDITS OF THE FILM per WP:FILMCAST-->\n{{cast listing|\n* [[Robert De Niro]] as [[Frank Sheeran]]\n* [[Al Pacino]] as [[Jimmy Hoffa]]\n* [[Joe Pesci]] as [[Russell Bufalino]]\n* [[Ray Romano]] as [[Bill Bufalino]]\n* [[Bobby Cannavale]] as Skinny Razor\n* [[Anna Paquin]] as Older Peggy Sheeran\n** Lucy Gallina as Young Peggy Sheeran\n* [[Stephen Graham]] as [[Anthony Provenzano|Anthony \"Tony Pro\" Provenzano]]\n* [[Harvey Keitel]] as [[Angelo Bruno]]\n* [[Stephanie Kurtzuba]] as Irene Sheeran\n* [[Kathrine Narducci]] as Carrie Bufalino\n* Welker White as Josephine \"Jo\" Hoffa\n* [[Jesse Plemons]] as Chuckie O'Brien\n* [[Jack Huston]] as [[Robert F.

This one actually started about 35 years ago with the idea of the remake of ''[[The Bad and the Beautiful]]'' and the sequel ''[[Two Weeks in Another Town]]''. Somehow we exhausted that.\"<ref name=\"1980s\" /> Afterwards, Scorsese approached De Niro with an idea to do an aging hitman story, which did not move forward.<ref name=\"BTS\" /> [[Robert De Niro|De Niro]] then revived that old discussion and \"got the project underway\" after reading a copy of the 2004 book ''[[I Heard You Paint Houses]]'' written by [[Charles Brandt]],<ref name=\"DeNiroBook\" /> with Scorsese saying that De Niro \"became rather emotional\" as he told him about the lead character.<ref name=\"SpikeLee\" /> Scorsese then became interested in directing a film adaptation of the book and in casting De Niro, [[Al Pacino]], and [[Joe Pesci]].<ref name=\"ScorseseInterested\" />\n\n''The Irishman'' started its development phase in 2007.<ref name=\"Variety\" /><ref name=\"Rosenthal\" /> New plot materials and rewrites caused the movie to lose its place in the film release calendar, and Scorsese went on to direct three more films, ''[[Hugo (film)|Hugo]]'' (2011), ''[[The Wolf of Wall Street (2013 film)|The Wolf of Wall Street]]'' (2013) and ''[[Silence (2016 film)|Silence]]'' (2016), before returning to ''The Irishman''.<ref name=\"Brandt\" /> In September 2014, after years of [[development hell]],<ref name=\"Variety\" /> Pacino confirmed that the film would be Scorsese's next project after ''Silence''.<ref name=\"PacinoStillHappening\" /> In October 2015, De Niro stated that the film was still happening and could have started filming in 2016 with Steven Zaillian confirmed as screenwriter.<ref name=\"DeNiroConfirmed\" /><ref name=\"ZaillianConfirmed\" /> In July 2017, it was reported that the film would be presented as a series of flashbacks of an older Frank Sheeran, depicted as recollecting his many criminal activities over several decades,<ref name=\"Writing\" /> with De Niro appearing \"as young as 24 years and as old as 80.\"<ref name=\"2015Test\" /> Producer [[Irwin Winkler]] defined the project as \"the coming together of people that have worked together since we're kids together\",<ref name=\"Winkler\" /> while Rosenthal said that \"what will surprise you is, as a Scorsese movie, it is a slower movie [...] it is guys looking at themselves through an older perspective.\"<ref name=\"Rosenthal\" />\n\n=== Financing and budget ===\nIn May 2016, Mexican production company [[F\u00e1brica de Cine]] had offered $100 million to finance the film, and through that deal [[Paramount Pictures]] would retain domestic rights.<ref name=\"Financing1\" /> [[IM Global]] was also circling to bid for the film's international sales rights.<ref name=\"Financing1\" /> [[STX Entertainment]] bought the international distribution rights to the film for $50 million beating out other studios like [[Universal Pictures]], [[20th Century Fox]], and [[Lionsgate]], while F\u00e1brica de Cine closed the deal and Paramount retained its domestic rights.<ref name=\"Financing2\" /><ref name=\"Financing3\" />\n\nBy February 2017, Paramount Pictures had dropped domestic distribution rights for ''The Irishman'' following the announcement that F\u00e1brica de Cine would not be financing the film due to its climbing budget. [[Netflix]] then bought the film rights for $105 million and agreed to finance the film's $125 million budget with a projected release date of October 2019.<ref name=\"105EstimatedBudget\" /><ref name=\"125EstimatedBudget\" /> In March 2018, it was also reported the film's budget had ballooned from $125 million to $140 million, due in large part to the visual effects needed to make De Niro, Pacino, and Pesci appear younger at various points throughout the film.<ref name=\"140EstimatedBudget\" /> By August of that year, speculation had arisen that the cost had reportedly risen to as much as $175 million by the time post-production was to have wrapped, and some publications asserted that it might go as high as $200 million.<ref name=\"Independent\" /><ref name=\"200EstimatedBudget\" /> In August 2019, it was reported that the film's official cost was $159 million, although it has been occasionally been noted as $173 million or even as high as the $200 million figure.<ref name=\"ReutersBudget\" /><ref name=\"LosAngelesTimesBudget\" /><ref name=\"DeadlineSoldOut\" /><ref name=\"WSJBudget\" />\n\n=== Writing ===\nIn July 2009, Brandt received a phone call from De Niro that led to a meeting a month later between the two of them, Scorsese and screenwriter Steven Zaillian.<ref name=\"Brandt\" /> The meeting was supposed to last an hour but ended up lasting four hours. Brandt said that \"the material was new to them\" and Zaillian already had a script ready, but the additions Brandt made required a do-over. To help, Brandt handed over a screenplay of his own. Brandt said, \"Zaillian is a great writer, don't get me wrong [...] I wanted to log the material.\"<ref name=\"Brandt\" /> In the opening credits and as a reflection of the writing adaptation process, the final film is titled ''I Heard You Paint Houses'', the name of the [[I Heard You Paint Houses|novel on which the picture is based]], while the title ''The Irishman'' only appears in the end credits.<ref name=\"OnScreenTitle\" />\n\nThe truthfulness of Sheeran's supposed confessions and the book on which the film was based has been challenged by \"The Lies of the Irishman\", an article on ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' by Bill Tonelli,<ref name=\"Tonelli\" /> as well as by \"Jimmy Hoffa and The Irishman: A True Crime Story?\" by [[Harvard Law School]] professor [[Jack Goldsmith]], which appeared in ''[[The New York Review of Books]]''.<ref name=\"Goldsmith\" /> Chip Fleischer, the publisher of ''I Heard You Paint Houses'', wrote a detailed reply to Tonelli's piece, calling it \"irresponsible in the extreme, not to mention damaging.\"<ref name=\"PublisherReply\" /> In an interview, De Niro defended the writing process of the film by stating, \"we're not saying we're telling the actual story [...] we're telling our story.\"<ref name=\"DeNiroResponse\" />\n\n=== Casting ===\n[[File:Harvey Keitel Cannes 2015.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Harvey Keitel]] portrayed the mob boss [[Angelo Bruno]].]]\nIn July 2017, Pacino and Pesci officially joined the cast, with [[Ray Romano]] also joining and [[Bobby Cannavale]] and [[Harvey Keitel]] in final negotiations.<ref name=\"PacinoStillHappening\" /> Pesci was offered his role a reported 50 times before agreeing to take part, at first saying he did not want to do \"the gangster thing again\", while Scorsese tried to persuade him ''The Irishman'' would be \"different.\"<ref name=\"SpikeLee\" /> De Niro played a big part in convincing Pesci to take the role, telling him \"We gotta do this. Who knows if there'll be anything after?\"<ref name=\"Empire\" /> In September 2017, [[Jack Huston]],<ref name=\"Cast1\" /> [[Stephen Graham]],<ref name=\"Cast2\" /> [[Domenick Lombardozzi]], [[Jeremy Luke]], Joseph Russo,<ref name=\"LombardozziConfirmed\" /> [[Kathrine Narducci]],<ref name=\"Cast3\" /> Danny Abeckaser,<ref name=\"Cast4\" /> [[J. C. MacKenzie]], and Craig Vincent<ref name=\"Cast5\" /> joined the cast. In October, [[Gary Basaraba]],<ref name=\"BarasabaConfirmed\" /> [[Anna Paquin]],<ref name=\"PaquinConfirmed\" /> Welker White,<ref name=\"WhiteConfirmed\" /> and [[Jesse Plemons]] joined the cast of the film. Later, Craig Di Francia and [[Action Bronson]] were revealed to have joined the cast.<ref name=\"DiFranciaConfirmed\" /><ref name=\"BronsonConfirmed\" /> [[Sebastian Maniscalco]] and [[Paul Ben-Victor]] were later revealed as being part of the cast.<ref name=\"ManiscalcoConfirmed\" /><ref name=\"Ben-VictorConfirmed\" />\n\n''The Irishman'' is the [[Martin Scorsese and Robert De Niro|ninth feature collaboration between De Niro and Scorsese]] and their first since 1995's ''[[Casino (1995 film)|Casino]]''; the fourth film to star both De Niro and Pacino (following ''[[The Godfather Part II]]'', ''[[Heat (1995 film)|Heat]],'' and ''[[Righteous Kill]]''); the seventh to star both De Niro and Pesci (following ''[[Raging Bull]]'', ''[[Once Upon a Time in America]]'', ''[[Goodfellas]]'', ''[[A Bronx Tale]]'', ''Casino'', and ''[[The Good Shepherd (film)|The Good Shepherd]]''); the first to star both Pacino and Pesci; and the first time Pacino has been directed by Scorsese. Scorsese said of finally working with Pacino, \"I'd been wanting to work with Al for years. [[Francis Ford Coppola|Francis Coppola]] introduced me to him in 1970. Then he's in [[The Godfather|''The Godfather'' one]] and two, and he's in the stratosphere. For me, Al was always something unreachable. We even tried to make a film in the 1980s but couldn't get the financing for it. I said, 'What's he like to work with?' Bob [De Niro] said, 'Oh, he's great. You'll see.'\" Scorsese added that there is a meta aspect to seeing Pacino and De Niro interact in ''The Irishman'', saying, \"What you see in the film is their relationship as actors, as friends, over the past 40, 45 years. There's something magical that happens there.\"<ref name=\"ScorsesePacino\" />\n\n=== Filming ===\n[[Principal photography]] was originally set to start in August 2017, in and around [[New York City]],<ref name=\"Filming2\" /><ref name=\"NewYorkPost\" /> and would continue through December 2017.<ref name=\"FilmingDuration\" /><ref name=\"RomanoConfirmed\" /> Instead, filming began on September 18, 2017 in New York City and in the [[Mineola, New York|Mineola]] and [[Williston Park]] sections of [[Long Island]],<ref name=\"Filming1\" /><ref name=\"FilmingStart\" /><ref name=\"FilmingInNewYork\" /> and wrapped on March 5, 2018, for a total of 108 days.<ref name=\"Wrapped\" /><ref name=\"Empire\" /> Additional scenes were filmed in the [[Hudson Valley]] in [[Salisbury Mills, New York|Salisbury Mills]] and [[Suffern, New York|Suffern]], among other sites, including [[Paterson, New Jersey]].<ref name=\"Filming3\" /><ref name=\"Paterson\" /><ref name=\"Filming4\" /> A posture coach was hired to instruct De Niro, Pacino, and Pesci on how to comport themselves like much younger men.<ref name=\"Empire\" /> The picture was primarily shot on [[35 mm movie film]] with [[Arricam]] ST and LT, and with [[Red Digital Cinema|RED Helium]] for sections shot on digital, with two IR-capable Alexa Mini as witness-cameras for the de-aging.<ref name=\"Cameras1\" /><ref name=\"Cameras2\" /> All scenes that required de-aging effects were shot digitally with a custom [[Multiple-camera setup|three-camera rig]].<ref name=\"Cameras1\" />\n\nScorsese envisioned the film as having an \"old-fashioned\" look which cinematographer [[Rodrigo Prieto]] accomplished by using \"a series of [[3D lookup table|lookup tables]]\" for each scene. Sherlock summarized the filming approach used for each historical decade depicted throughout the film, stating: \"The '50s-set scenes have a Kodachrome look; the '60s-set scenes have an Ektachrome look; the '70s-set scenes have a silvery layer plastered over them; and any scene set in the '80s and onwards have a 'bleach bypass' look, and are also more de-saturated than the other scenes.\"<ref name=\"BTS\" /> The extensive [[Production designer|production design]] covered 117 filming locations, 319 scenes, 160 actors, in a story spanning 50 years. Producer, Emma Tillinger Koskoff, summarized her relation to Scorsese and his principal crew stating: \"I also work closely with the line producer, AD [Assistant Director] and DP [Director of Photography] on a budget and schedule, and we create a production plan that will realize Marty's vision... We scouted a lot. Our prep was almost six months; sometimes we were scouting after the day's wrap, trying to find new location... due to weather or whatever; it was pretty insane.\"<ref name=\"MegaProduction\" />\n\n[[Sandy Powell (costume designer)|Sandy Powell]] and Christopher Peterson were costume designer and co-designer, respectively. Speaking about Scorsese, Powell said, \"one of the things he said on a first meeting was that we weren't doing the same kind of gangsters as ''Goodfellas'' or ''Casino'' [...] these weren't flashy peacock looks. We were doing a low-key version. I mean, there are some obvious mafia types in there, but half of that is the way these people hold themselves.\" The film had a total of \"250 characters and 6,500 extras\", said Peterson, with Powell adding that \"you need a lot of research, a lot of hard work, and you need to just get down and do it, [...] you basically have to sort of divide your brain up into those five different decades, and approach it as if there are three or four films in one. You're filming more than one decade in one day, and that's when you'd have to really know what you were doing.\"<ref name=\"CostumeDesign\" />\n\nBill Desowitz, writing for ''[[IndieWire]]'', stated that the film had been considered as contending for an Oscar nomination for its editing. Editor, [[Thelma Schoonmaker]] commented on the editing of the film stating: \"Marty wanted to show the banality of the violence... It's not like the incredible camera moves or flashy editing of the earlier movies. Victims are killed in an instant \u2014 often in very simple wide shots. And his brilliant idea of slamming the titles in front of the audience (describing how various mob characters die) was a way of showing that being part of the Mafia is not a good idea\".<ref name=\"Editing\" />\n\n=== Visual effects ===\n{{Quote box\n|quote = There's a great deal of [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] because we're doing this youthification of De Niro, Pesci, and Al Pacino. They had to be CGI [...] Why I'm concerned, we're all concerned is that we're so used to watching them as the older faces. When we put them all together, it cuts back and forth [...] Now, it's real. Now, I'm seeing it. Now, certain shots need more work on the eyes, need more work on why these exactly the same eyes from the plate shot, but the wrinkles and things have changed. Does it change the eyes at all? If that's the case, what was in the eyes that I liked? Was it intensity? Was it gravitas?

Scorsese said that \"the risk was there, and that was it. We just tried to make the film.

He's going to want to be in the moment with Joe Pesci and Al Pacino on set, with no markers on him.

Nielsen also noted that the largest number of viewers to watch the film in its entirety (930,000) came on November 29, and its opening day demo was made up mostly of men aged 50\u201364 (20%), while they also made up an overall 15% of the viewership over the five-day period.<ref name=NetflixViewers /> Several days later, Netflix's [[chief content officer]] [[Ted Sarandos]] announced that a total of 26.4 million accounts worldwide had watched at least 70% of the film, meaning that about 16% of all Netflix account holders watched the film during its first week of release.<ref name=\"NetflixViewers2\" /> It was the fourth most watched Netflix film of 2019, and the fifth most popular Netflix release overall.<ref name=\"NetflixPopular\" />\n\n=== Limited theatrical release ===\n[[File:CMiks - The Irishman table - CCA 2020 01 12.jpg|thumb|Al Pacino and Robert De Niro during the [[25th Critics' Choice Awards]] in Santa Monica, California on January 12, 2020.]]\n==== United States ====\n''The Irishman'' received a limited theatrical release on November 1, 2019 in the United States.<ref name=\"ReleaseDate\" /> As part of the continuing tensions between the film markets for direct-to-digital streaming and theatrical releases and distribution of films, several theater chains protested the policy of Netflix for the release of Scorsese's ''The Irishman''. The film did not play at the theaters owned by [[AMC Theatres|AMC]], [[Cinemark Theatres|Cinemark]], [[Regal Cinemas|Regal]] or [[Cineplex Entertainment|Cineplex]], because the \"four week progression to [[Subscription video on demand|SVOD]] remains unacceptable to those chains.\"<ref name=\"ReleaseDate\" /> It was previously reported in February 2019 that Netflix would possibly give the film a wide theatrical release, at the request of Scorsese.<ref name=\"PossibleWideRelease1\" /> The heads of several theater chains, including AMC's [[Adam Aron]], who refused to play ''[[Roma (2018 film)|Roma]]'' the previous November, said they would only be open to playing ''The Irishman'' if Netflix \"respects the decades old theatrical window, that suggests that movies come to theaters first for a couple of months, and then go to the home.\"<ref name=\"PossibleWideRelease2\" /> Two major chains offered to exhibit the film if given an exclusivity window of 60 days, approximately two weeks shorter than the typical window, but could not reach an agreement with Netflix.<ref name=\"TheaterChains\" /> The film peaked at playing in 500 theaters, essentially the most possible without the involvement of a major chain.<ref name=\"FifthWeekend\" />\n\n==== Other countries ====\nIn the United Kingdom, [[Altitude Film Distribution]] launched the film through the [[Everyman Cinemas|Everyman]] and [[Curzon Cinemas|Curzon]] cinema chains, where the film was shown on about 80 screens, while other British cinema chains, including [[Picturehouse Cinemas|Picturehouse]], [[Vue Cinemas|Vue]], and [[Odeon Cinemas|Odeon]], turned down the film in order to uphold the 90-day window that was standard practice across much of Europe.<ref name=\"BiggestRelease\" /> In [[Italy]], ''The Irishman'' played on about 100 screens via [[Cineteca di Bologna]], the same distributor that released ''Roma'' in 2018 and caused an uproar among Italian exhibitors, but no similar protests have occurred over ''The Irishman''.<ref name=\"BiggestRelease\" /> The film also received limited releases in Germany, Spain, Ireland, Japan, Brazil, South Korea, Canada, Australia, and New Zealand. The film did not play in France because of the country's 30-month window between a film's theatrical release and its availability on TV and other outlets. Despite all of this, ''The Irishman'' became Netflix's biggest theatrical release both in the United States and internationally.<ref name=\"BiggestRelease\" />\n\n=== Marketing ===\nThe announcement trailer for the film premiered during the [[91st Academy Awards]] ceremony on February 24, 2019.<ref name=\"AnnouncementTrailer\" /> Netflix then released a teaser trailer on July 31, 2019,<ref name=\"TeaserTrailer\" /> while the official trailer debuted on ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon]]'' on September 25, 2019.<ref name=\"OfficialTrailer\" /> The final trailer was released on November 19, 2019.<ref name=\"FinalTrailer\" /> To promote the release of the film on its streaming service, Netflix took over five blocks of [[Little Italy, Manhattan]] on November 22 and 23, 2019 and back-dated them to August 1, 1975, the day after [[Jimmy Hoffa]] was reported missing.<ref name=\"LittleItaly\" />\n\n=== Home media ===\nIn January 2020, it was announced that ''The Irishman'' would receive [[DVD]] and [[Blu-ray]] releases by [[The Criterion Collection]].<ref name=\"DVD\" />\n\n== Reception ==\n=== Box office ===\n''The Irishman'' opened at three [[theaters in New York City]] and five in Los Angeles on November 1, 2019;<ref name=\"OpeningWeekendTheaters\" /> while Netflix does not publicly disclose box office figures for its films, ''IndieWire'' estimated that it grossed a \"strong\" $350,000 in its opening weekend, an average $43,750 per venue.<ref name=\"OpeningWeekend\" /> ''[[Deadline Hollywood|Deadline]]'' noted that numerous showtimes at several theaters, including [[Grauman's Egyptian Theatre]] in Los Angeles and the [[IFC Center]] in New York, had sold-out showings. The magazine also argued that had the film gone wide theatrically, it likely would have become a [[box office bomb]] given its 209-minute runtime and large budget, noting that another period crime film with a long runtime that opened the same weekend, ''[[Motherless Brooklyn (film)|Motherless Brooklyn]]'', failed to meet its projections.<ref name=\"DeadlineSoldOut\" /> Conversely, [[CNBC]] wrote that Netflix was \"leaving millions on the table\" by not giving the film a wide theatrical release, and claimed it could have legged out to at least $100 million at the domestic box office, citing the high demand for tickets during its opening weekend (with some reselling for $65\u201385) and that Scorsese's last gangster film, ''[[The Departed]]'', made $132 million in 2006.<ref name=\"CNBC-BO\" />\n\nExpanding to 22 theaters in its second weekend, the film made an estimated $440,000, for a ten-day running total of about $940,000.<ref name=\"SecondWeekend\" /> It then grossed an estimated $1.25 million from 175 theaters in its third week,<ref name=\"ThirdWeekend\" /> and $1.2 million from 200 in its fourth.<ref name=\"FourthWeekend\" /> Despite being released on Netflix on November 27, the film expanded to 500 theaters in its fifth weekend, \"close to the maximum number with most top theater chains refusing to let their customers have a chance to see it in theaters despite the acclaim and interest\", and made an estimated $1 million.<ref name=\"FifthWeekend\" /> It then made an estimated $450,000 from 320 theaters in its sixth weekend \u2014 likely becoming Netflix's most successful theatrical release to-date with a running total of $6.7 million \u2014 and then $100,000 from 70 theaters in its seventh.<ref name=\"SixthWeekend\" /><ref name=\"SeventhWeekend\" /> Through its eighth and ninth weekend,<ref name=\"EighthWeekend\" /> the film was reduced to minimal theater play.<ref name=\"NinthWeekend\" /> ''The Irishman'' grossed an estimated $7 million in North America and $968,683 in other territories, for a worldwide total of $8 million.<ref name=\"EighthWeekend\" /><ref name=\"BOM\" />\n\n=== Critical response ===\n{{multiple image|total_width=400\n|image1 = Robert De Niro 2 by David Shankbone.jpg\n|width1 = 600\n|height1 = 700\n|image2 = Al Pacino.jpg\n|width2 = 600\n|height2 = 700\n|image3 = JoePesci-2009.jpg\n|width3 = 600\n|height3 = 700\n|footer = The performances of (left to right) [[Robert De Niro]], [[Al Pacino]], and [[Joe Pesci]] garnered critical acclaim, with the latter two being nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]].\n}}\n\nOn [[review aggregator]] [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film holds an approval rating of 96% based on 421 reviews, with an average rating of 8.77/10.

think that's all it's going to be\" and that \"its last half-hour is deeply moving in a way that creeps up on you, and it's then that you see what Scorsese was working toward all along\"; she also added that \"the de-aging is distracting at first [...] but the special effects are hardly a deal breaker, and in the end they probably add to the movie's mythological vibe.\"<ref name=\"TIMEReview\" /> Similarly, [[Owen Gleiberman]] of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' called it \"a coldly enthralling, long-form knockout \u2014 a majestic Mob epic with ice in its veins\", particularly praising Pacino's performance as \"the film's most extraordinary.\"<ref name=\"VarietyReview\" /> ''[[RogerEbert.com]]''{{'}}s [[Matt Zoller Seitz]] gave the film three and a half stars out of four, defining Scorsese as \"one of the greatest living, though still largely unsung, comedy directors\" and also praised the editing of Thelma Schoonmaker.<ref name=\"RogerEbert.comReview\" />\n\nBenjamin Lee of ''[[The Guardian]]'' wrote that in the film \"there's an almost meta-maturity, as if Scorsese is also looking back on his own career, the film leaving us with a haunting reminder not to glamorise violent men and the wreckage they leave behind.\"<ref name=\"TheGuardianReview\" /> Mike Ryan of ''[[Uproxx]]'' called it a \"phenomenal film\", stating that the de-aging is \"pretty good\" and \"the best I've seen so far\", but noted that \"if you stare at it, yes, you can see the imperfections [...] but you do get used to it\",<ref name=\"UproxxReview\" /> while Johnny Oleksinski of the ''[[New

unexpectedly deep themes for mafiosos.\"<ref name=\"NewYorkPostReview\" /> ''IndieWire''{{'}}s Eric Kohn stated that \"''The Irishman'' is Martin Scorsese's best crime movie since ''[[Goodfellas]]'', and a pure, unbridled illustration of what has made his filmmaking voice so distinctive for nearly 50 years\", reserving particular praise for Steven Zaillian's screenplay, writing that \"Zaillian hasn't delivered a script this polished since ''[[Moneyball (film)|Moneyball]]''.\"<ref name=\"IndieWireReview\" /> [[David Edelstein]] wrote for ''[[New York (magazine)|Vulture]]'' that \"Pesci [...] plays Bufalino as almost supernaturally focused and watchful, always hypersensitive to other peoples' rhythms [...] I thank the gods of acting that he came out of retirement to do this.\" He also praised the performances of De Niro and Pacino, stating that ''The Irishman'' is one of Scorsese's \"most satisfying films in decades.\"<ref name=\"VultureReview\" /> Writing for ''[[TheWrap]]'', [[Alonso Duralde]] praised Rodrigo Prieto's cinematography and Scorsese's direction, writing that \"at the age of 76, Scorsese is embracing new technologies with the fervor of [[Ang Lee]] [...] and indulging in retro fantasy with the keen eye of [[Quentin Tarantino]].\"<ref name=\"TheWrapReview\" /> Nicholas Rapold of ''[[Film Comment]]'', gave the de-aging [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] approach used in the filming a mixed assessment, stating that: \"De Niro's rosy complexion as a truck driver 'kid' recalls a tinted postcard photo more than a twentysomething person, and I can't explain away the same de-aged De Niro curb-stomping a grocer, looking more like the septuagenarian star he is than a ferociously protective thirtysomething dad.\"<ref name=\"Rapold\" />\n\nWhile giving a positive review, David Rooney of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' criticized the running time, stating that \"the excessive length ultimately is a weakness\" and \"that the material would have been better served by losing an hour or more to run at standard feature length.\"<ref name=\"TheHollywoodReporterReview\" /> Writing for the ''[[National Review]]'', [[Kyle Smith]] gave a more critical review, saying that \"while it's a good film, it isn't a great one\" and also commented that \"[''The Irishman''] could easily be trimmed by 30 minutes or more by tightening up the midsection.\"<ref name=\"NationalReviewReview\" /> Conversely, [[Richard Brody]] of ''[[The New Yorker]]'' wrote \"it runs a minute shy of three and a half hours, and I wouldn't wish it any shorter\",<ref name=\"TheNewYorkerReview\" /> and Karen Han of ''[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]'' said that \"Scorsese is so adept at storytelling, and his cast is so unbelievable, that the film [...] barely feels its length.\"<ref name=\"PolygonReview\" />\n\n''The Irishman'' also garnered acclaim from a number of filmmakers, whom listed the film as one of their favorites of 2019, including [[Ana Lily Amirpour]], [[Olivier Assayas]], [[Bong Joon-ho]], [[Guillermo del Toro]], [[Luca Guadagnino]], [[Ciro Guerra]], [[Bill Hader]], [[Don Hertzfeldt]], [[Alejandro Landes]], [[Alex Ross Perry]], [[Paul Schrader]], [[Adam Wingard]], and Quentin Tarantino, who ranked it as his favorite of the year.<ref name=\"Filmmakers\" /><ref name=\"Tarantino\" /> Del Toro commented on the film in a [[Twitter|tweet]], by comparing it to [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s ''[[Barry Lyndon]]'' and praised the cast performances, especially, Pesci, calling him \"supremely minimalistic\" and \"masterful\" and he went on to define ''The Irishman'' as a \"masterpiece\" and \"the perfect corollary [to] ''[[Goodfellas]]'' and ''[[Casino (1995 film)|Casino]]''.\"<ref name=\"delToroDuVernay\" /> [[Edgar Wright]] wrote, \"''The Irishman'' [...] feels like a riposte to the imitators of ''Goodfellas'' who revel only in the parts about the 'glamour' of the business. This film coldly makes the point that this way of life leads only to death, inside and out.\"<ref name=\"Wright\" /> [[Ava DuVernay]] also praised the film, writing: \"running time is 3 hours and some change. For me, it flew by [...] A film made by a filmmaker who feels free. Who has all the tools. All the time. All the talent. And lives up to it. Wow.\"<ref name=\"delToroDuVernay\" /> [[Leonardo DiCaprio]], a [[Martin Scorsese and Leonardo DiCaprio|frequent Scorsese collaborator]], complimented the film at the 2019 [[Santa Barbara International Film Festival]], saying, \"It plays like an elegy. It's a movie about looking upon what you've left behind and squaring up with all of it, but for me, what's more astounding about this film, in my mind, Marty [Scorsese] transcends his own signature genre and creates a film that methodically transforms itself into an exploration of our very own universally shared mortality.

After comparing the film to [[David Cronenberg]]'s ''[[A History of Violence]]'', Rapold stated: \"Frank is not [[psychopathic]], but [[sociopathic]]. Whichever the case, one might ask how unusual Frank in ''The Irishman'' is meant to be. Oddly enough, people in recent years have been spending quite a bit of their spare time watching killers, and in situations outside the usual context of law enforcement. Watching or rewatching assorted acclaimed TV series, I couldn't help noticing how many zero in on people for whom killing is routine: ''[[The Sopranos]]'', ''[[The Americans]]'', ''[[Barry (TV series)|Barry]]'', ''[[Mindhunter (TV series)|Mindhunter]]'', ''[[Killing Eve]]'', ''[[Dexter (TV series)|Dexter]]''. (There's also the apocalyptic strand in which almost everyone has already died, like ''[[The Leftovers (TV series)|The Leftovers]]'', or everyone is dead, like ''[[The Good Place]]'', or in the niche case of ''[[Russian Doll (TV series)|Russian Doll]]'', one person keeps dying.) Very often these shows return to the hollowing-out that is felt through the destruction of human life and through the maintenance of the double life required to insulate that pursuit\".<ref name=\"Rapold\" />\n\n[[Richard Brody]], writing for ''The New Yorker'', found the film to be a dark allegory of American politics and American society, stating: \"The real-life Hoffa [was] a crucial player in both gangland politics and the actual practical politics of the day, and the movie's key through line is the inseparability of those two realms. ''The Irishman'' is a sociopolitical horror story that views much of modern American history as a continuous crime in motion, in which every level of society\u2014from domestic life through local business through big business through national and international politics\u2014is poisoned by graft and bribery, shady deals and dirty money, threats of violence and its gruesome enactment, and the hard-baked impunity that keeps the entire system running\".<ref name=\"Brody\" />\n\nIn his extended comments on ''The Irishman'', [[Guillermo del Toro]] found the thematic content of the film and its depiction of character development to be comparable to the films of \"Renoir, Bresson, Bergman, Oliveira or Kurosawa.\" Using cinematic techniques involving interconnected flashbacks and flashforwards, del Toro found Scorsese's juxtaposition of the \"ruthless gangster\" depicted in Frank Sheeran with his \"diminished, elderly self\" as compelling depictions of where \"oblivion reigns supreme\". Del Toro's thematic emphasis, as he attributes it to Scorsese, is the portrayal of the demise of Sheeran in the frailty of his old age as overshadowing the ruthless and relentless accumulation of his criminal activities which defined his more youthful years, with old age transforming Sheeran into a forgotten shadow of his former self.<ref name=\"delToro\" />\n\n== References

''Yadav'' is another word that may have the same origin. In the [[Saurashtra (region)|Saurashtra region]] of western Gujarat they exist as two [[endogamy|endogamous]] groups, known as the Mota Bhai (Motabhai) and the Nana Bhai (Nanabhai). According to the [[Anthropological Survey of India]]'s ''People of India'' series, Bharwads in the Saurashtra region often append ''[[Ahir]]'' to their names, while in south Gujarat it is common to see ''PATAL MUKHIYA'' appended.{{sfnp|Lal|Padmanabham|Krishnan|Mohideen|2003|pp=194-199|ps=}}\n\n== Origin ==\nThe Bharwads consider themselves to be descended from the mythological [[Nandvanshi]] line that began with [[Nanda (mythology)|Nanda]], the foster-father of [[Krishna]]. Legend has it that Nanda came from [[Gokul]], in [[Mathura district]], and passed through Saurashtra on his way to [[Dwarka]].{{sfnp|Mitra|2005|p=84|ps=}} According to their traditions, the Bharwads were at some time based around [[Mathura]] and migrated to [[Mewar]] before later spreading out in Gujarat.{{sfnp|Lal|Padmanabham|Krishnan|Mohideen|2003|pp=194-199|ps=}} Sudipta Mitra considers their move to Gujarat to have been predicated by a desire to keep away from the [[Muslim]] invasion of [[Sind]]. They arrived in the northern town of [[Banaskantha]] in 961 CE and later spread out to Saurashtra and other areas.{{sfnp|Mitra|2005|p=84|ps=}}\n\nThere are other theories of origin. These include that they are an offshoot of the [[Bharude]] cattle-herders of [[Madhya Pradesh]] and that they are descendants of Anavil Bharwad, who helped a [[Chavda]] prince regain his kingdom. It is also possible that they are related to the Ahirs of Gujarat, with whom they share a common traditional occupation.{{sfnp|Lal|Padmanabham|Krishnan|Mohideen|2003|pp=194-199|ps=}}\n\n== Divisions ==\nOf the various reasons given for the division between Motabhai and Nanabhai, the most popular is that two shepherd brothers were ordered by [[Krishna]] to take their flocks to different places. The older of the brothers went on to marry a Bharwad woman while the other married a [[Koli people|Koli]]. Since the latter was a marriage outside the community, the offspring were deemed to be [[untouchability|ritually polluted]]. Thus the Motabhai (literally, \"big brother\") descend from the first and the Nanabhai (\"little brother\") from the latter.{{sfnp|Tarlo|1996|p=147|ps=}}\n\nThe Bharwads have numerous subgroups known as ''ataks'' or ''guls'' (clans) whose main purpose is to determine eligibility for marriage. A constrained [[exogamy]] is practised between clans{{efn|For example, the Rathadia, Jadav and Yadav clans of the Mota Bhai consider that they are socially superior to the other clans and will only marry between themselves.{{sfnp|Lal|Padmanabham|Krishnan|Mohideen|2003|pp=194-199|ps=}}}} but endogamy exists between the two Saurashtrian divisions despite there being no other social constraints on mixing. The Saurashtra Bharwads also hold a higher status than those in the south and thus marriage between the two regional groups operates in one direction only: daughters of southern Bharwads can marry into the family of those from Saurashtra.{{sfnp|Lal|Padmanabham|Krishnan|Mohideen|2003|pp=194-199|ps=}}\n\n<!--PLEASE DO NOT ADD ANY FURTHER CLANS HERE UNLESS THEY ARE SOURCED-->\nClans of the Mota Bhai Bharwads include the Babha, Bathela, Colthar, Dabi, Dhangia, Dharangia, Garia, Gomara, Jadav, Kathodi, Ker, Lambari, Matia, Mundhva, Pancha, Rathadia, Sania, Sasda, Tota and Yadav.{{sfnp|Lal|Padmanabham|Krishnan|Mohideen|2003|pp=194-199|ps=}}\n\nAmong the Bharwad of south Gujarat, their main clans are the Chandulka, Dahika, Gundarya, Jodika, Kalwamia, Khohadya, Kuhadiya and Rokadka.{{sfnp|Lal|Padmanabham|Krishnan|Mohideen|2003|pp=194-199|ps=}}\n<!--PLEASE DO NOT ADD ANY FURTHER CLANS HERE UNLESS THEY ARE SOURCED-->\n\n== Varna and socio-economic status ==\nThe [[Varna (Hinduism)|varna]] system of Hinduism is a traditional ritual ranking system based on levels of purported religious purity. Within this four-fold scheme, the Bharwads consider themselves to be [[Vaishya]] but they also believe themselves to be equal to [[Rajput]] communities that are generally considered to be of the more pure [[Kshatriya]] varna. They also believe themselves to be of a higher ritual status than [[artisan]] groups such as the [[Lohar]]s and [[Suthar]]s.{{sfnp|Lal|Padmanabham|Krishnan|Mohideen|2003|pp=194-199|ps=}}\n\nDespite their own beliefs, the Bharwads are generally treated within regional society as being somewhat below the [[Brahmin]], [[Bania (caste)|Vania]], [[Lohana]], Patel, [[Charan]] and [[Dharjee]] communities.{{sfnp|Lal|Padmanabham|Krishnan|Mohideen|2003|pp=194-199|ps=}} Mitra notes that they are generally considered to be among the lowest of the pastoral castes, being engaged primarily in the herding of goats and sheep.{{efn|Some Bharwads are cattle-herders but their number is declining.{{sfnp|Mitra|2005|p=84|ps=}}}} However, although one of the [[Maldhari]] nomadic communities, they are also among the most urbanised of the region and, combined with their niche position in the supply of milk, which forms their main source of income, this has enabled them to improve their traditional social position.{{sfnp|Mitra|2005|pp=65, 84|ps=}}\n\n== Customs ==\n\n=== Religion ===\nThe Bharwad are Hindu, and like other Hindu pastoral communities pay special reverence to Krishna. Each clan also has its own deity, while their chief goddess is Masai Mata. Their most sacred place is at [[Morvi]] and they also make pilgrimages to place such as Dwarka. Some Bharwads in the south have become [[vegetarian]] as a consequence of outside influences.{{sfnp|Lal|Padmanabham|Krishnan|Mohideen|2003|pp=194-199|ps=}}\n\n=== Family arrangements ===\nMembers of the community practice [[monogamy]] and [[arranged marriage]]s are traditional, usually accompanied by a ritualised exchange of gifts between the partners.{{sfnp|Lal|Padmanabham|Krishnan|Mohideen|2003|pp=194-199|ps=}} There is anecdotal evidence that ''pet chandla'' (marriage of children while they are still in the womb) is practised by some members of the community.{{sfnp|Tarlo|1996|p=272|ps=}} In other cases, a ''sagai'' (engagement) ceremony takes place when children are aged 2\u20133, with the marriage age usually being between 18-20 for women and 20-22 for men.{{efn|Marriages of six-year-olds have been recorded but most do not marry so young.{{sfnp|Tarlo|1996|pp=155, 253|ps=}}}} Remarriage in situations where the couple are childless requires the consent of the wife, and divorce is not usually tolerated except in this situation and that of mental infirmity. Remarriage upon widowhood is also accepted but men are expected generally to prefer a younger unmarried sister of their late wife.{{sfnp|Lal|Padmanabham|Krishnan|Mohideen|2003|pp=194-199|ps=}}\n\nMarried couples live in a [[patrilocal]] arrangement. The Bharwads practice male [[equigeniture]], meaning that property is inherited equally by the male children, and it is the eldest son who becomes head of household on the death of the father. Women have no rights of inheritance over property. Although consulted, they also have no final say in the making of significant decisions.{{sfnp|Lal|Padmanabham|Krishnan|Mohideen|2003|pp=194-199|ps=}}\n\n=== Clothing ===\nThe Bharwads practice \"sartorial conservatism\", according to Emma Tarlo, and it is not enough to be born a Bharwad if a person wants to be accepted as one: conforming with standards of dress and other customs is a necessity if a person is not to be considered a deserter from the community.{{sfnp|Tarlo|1996|pp=258, 262-263|ps=}} The details of clothing&nbsp;\u2014 in terms of style, colour and material&nbsp;\u2014 have changed over time while retaining a distinct Bharwad character. Despite it being a relatively recent practice, the wearing of pink and red shawls by both women and men is one of the most obvious identifiers of the modern community and they are worn even by those who shun the other aspects of the Bharwadi dress code in favour of Western styles.{{sfnp|Tarlo|1996|p=271-272|ps=}} The desire to identify through clothing and also through [[tattoo]]s may be a reflection of the community's traditional itinerant lifestyle, whereby a means of recognising their fellows was a significant social factor.{{sfnp|Tarlo|1996|p=273|ps=}}\n\nThe clothing worn by Bharwad women was traditionally made from coarse wool woven by members of local [[Untouchability|untouchable]] communities. In addition, they embroidered their own open-backed [[bodice]]s. The garments at that time&nbsp;\u2014 as late as the early 20th century&nbsp;\u2014 comprised the bodice, an unstitched black or red waist-cloth, known as a ''jimi'', and a veil. Motabhai clothing was made from thicker wool than that of the Nanabhai, leading to the two groups referring to themselves as \"thick cloth\" and \"thin cloth\". The veil was dyed black and bore red dots if the woman was a Motabhai and yellow if she was Nanabhai. While the styles and colours remain similar, modern Bharwad women use [[man-made fibre]]s, such as [[polyester]], and cotton. This change may be in part because the modern materials are of finer texture but it is more likely than it came about because of their relative cheapness. Cost is an important factor among the generally penurious community and women could sell the woollen fabric that they had used for clothing for a greater price than they paid for the replacement man-made fabric clothes.{{sfnp|Tarlo|1996|pp=xiii, 147, 267|ps=}} Tarlo quotes a Bharwad woman saying that \"If you wear a sari then you can no longer be called a Bharwad. That is the way it is among our caste. Better to die than change your clothes.\"{{sfnp|Tarlo|1996|p=257|ps=}}\n\nThe men commonly wear a silver ear-ring, called a ''variya'', and a [[pagri (turban)]]. The length of the turban differs between the two divisions,{{sfnp|Lal|Padmanabham|Krishnan|Mohideen|2003|pp=194-199|ps=}} and there are numerous ways of tying them. A white turban, rather than the more usual pink or red, is a symbol of seniority.{{sfnp|Tarlo|1996|p=271|ps=}} Wearing Western-style clothing is still not generally accepted but the traditional three woollen blankets, worn around the head, waist and shoulders, have in many cases been replaced by a cotton ''[[kediyun]]'' together with a ''[[dhoti]]'' or ''[[chorni]]''.{{sfnp|Tarlo|1996|p=151|ps=}} As with the women, Carol Henderson notes that {{quote|[Bharwads] say that if a man doesn't wear their dress, he ceases to be Bharwad. Being Bharwad means dressing Bharwad. Bharwad men wear a distinctive short gathered smock with long, tight sleeves, massive wound turban, gathered pantaloons, and a shawl.{{sfnp|Henderson|2002|p=113|ps=}}}}\n\n== Occupations ==\n[[Image:Map Guj Gir NatPark Sanctuary.png|thumb|right|Many of the Bharwad community are found in the [[Gir Forest National Park]].]]\nBharwads are rarely educated beyond primary level and literacy rates are poor. Many of them live in and around the [[Gir Forest National Park]], where they tend to keep away from the forest itself when grazing their livestock due to the danger of attacks by [[Asiatic lion]]s. Aside from their involvement with livestock, the main source of income is agricultural labouring; few of them own land.{{sfnp|Mitra|2005|pp=65, 84|ps=}}\n\n== Community associations ==\nThere is a hierarchy of ''nyat [[panchayat]]s'' (community councils) for the resolution of disputes. These are headed by chiefs and comprise several other members. The lowest tier of this are those that operate at the level of a single village or of a group of villages if the Bharwad population is small. Matters that cannot be settled at that level are referred upwards to a regional ''panchayat'' and thereafter to a central body based at [[Rajkot]].

''[[Gadaria]]'' is another word that may have the same origin. In the [[Saurashtra (region)|Saurashtra region]] of western Gujarat they exist as two [[endogamy|endogamous]] groups, known as the Mota Bhai (Motabhai) and the Nana Bhai (Nanabhai). According to the [[Anthropological Survey of India]]'s ''People of India'' series, Bharwads in the Saurashtra region often append ''[[Ahir]]'' to their names, while in south Gujarat it is common to see ''[[Patel]]'' appended.{{sfnp|Lal|Padmanabham|Krishnan|Mohideen|2003|pp=194-199|ps=}}\n\n== Origin ==\nThe Bharwads consider themselves to be descended from the mythological [[Nandvanshi]] line that began with [[Nanda (mythology)|Nanda]], the foster-father of [[Krishna]]. Legend has it that Nanda came from [[Gokul]], in [[Mathura district]], and passed through Saurashtra on his way to [[Dwarka]].{{sfnp|Mitra|2005|p=84|ps=}} According to their traditions, the Bharwads were at some time based around [[Mathura]] and migrated to [[Mewar]] before later spreading out in Gujarat.{{sfnp|Lal|Padmanabham|Krishnan|Mohideen|2003|pp=194-199|ps=}} Sudipta Mitra considers their move to Gujarat to have been predicated by a desire to keep away from the [[Muslim]] invasion of [[Sind]]. They arrived in the northern town of [[Banaskantha]] in 961 CE and later spread out to Saurashtra and other areas.{{sfnp|Mitra|2005|p=84|ps=}}\n\nThere are other theories of origin. These include that they are an offshoot of the [[Bharude]] cattle-herders of [[Madhya Pradesh]] and that they are descendants of Anavil Bharwad, who helped a [[Chavda]] prince regain his kingdom. It is also possible that they are related to the Ahirs of Gujarat, with whom they share a common traditional occupation.{{sfnp|Lal|Padmanabham|Krishnan|Mohideen|2003|pp=194-199|ps=}}\n\n== Divisions ==\nOf the various reasons given for the division between Motabhai and Nanabhai, the most popular is that two shepherd brothers were ordered by [[Krishna]] to take their flocks to different places. The older of the brothers went on to marry a Bharwad woman while the other married a [[Koli people|Koli]]. Since the latter was a marriage outside the community, the offspring were deemed to be [[untouchability|ritually polluted]]. Thus the Motabhai (literally, \"big brother\") descend from the first and the Nanabhai (\"little brother\") from the latter.{{sfnp|Tarlo|1996|p=147|ps=}}\n\nThe Bharwads have numerous subgroups known as ''ataks'' or ''guls'' (clans) whose main purpose is to determine eligibility for marriage. A constrained [[exogamy]] is practised between clans{{efn|For example, the Rathadia, Jadav and Yadav clans of the Mota Bhai consider that they are socially superior to the other clans and will only marry between themselves.{{sfnp|Lal|Padmanabham|Krishnan|Mohideen|2003|pp=194-199|ps=}}}} but endogamy exists between the two Saurashtrian divisions despite there being no other social constraints on mixing. The Saurashtra Bharwads also hold a higher status than those in the south and thus marriage between the two regional groups operates in one direction only: daughters of southern Bharwads can marry into the family of those from Saurashtra.{{sfnp|Lal|Padmanabham|Krishnan|Mohideen|2003|pp=194-199|ps=}}\n\n<!--PLEASE DO NOT ADD ANY FURTHER CLANS HERE UNLESS THEY ARE SOURCED-->\nClans of the Mota Bhai Bharwads include the Babha, Bathela, Colthar, Dabi, Dhangia, Dharangia, Garia, Gomara, Jadav, Kathodi, Ker, Lambari, Matia, Mundhva, Pancha, Rathadia, Sania, Sasda, Tota and Yadav.{{sfnp|Lal|Padmanabham|Krishnan|Mohideen|2003|pp=194-199|ps=}}\n\nAmong the Bharwad of south Gujarat, their main clans are the Chandulka, Dahika, Gundarya, Jodika, Kalwamia, Khohadya, Kuhadiya and Rokadka.{{sfnp|Lal|Padmanabham|Krishnan|Mohideen|2003|pp=194-199|ps=}}\n<!--PLEASE DO NOT ADD ANY FURTHER CLANS HERE UNLESS THEY ARE SOURCED-->\n\n== Varna and socio-economic status ==\nThe [[Varna (Hinduism)|varna]] system of Hinduism is a traditional ritual ranking system based on levels of purported religious purity. Within this four-fold scheme, the Bharwads consider themselves to be [[Vaishya]] but they also believe themselves to be equal to [[Rajput]] communities that are generally considered to be of the more pure [[Kshatriya]] varna. They also believe themselves to be of a higher ritual status than [[artisan]] groups such as the [[Lohar]]s and [[Suthar]]s.{{sfnp|Lal|Padmanabham|Krishnan|Mohideen|2003|pp=194-199|ps=}}\n\nDespite their own beliefs, the Bharwads are generally treated within regional society as being somewhat below the [[Brahmin]], [[Bania (caste)|Vania]], [[Lohana]], Patel, [[Charan]] and [[Dharjee]] communities.{{sfnp|Lal|Padmanabham|Krishnan|Mohideen|2003|pp=194-199|ps=}} Mitra notes that they are generally considered to be among the lowest of the pastoral castes, being engaged primarily in the herding of goats and sheep.{{efn|Some Bharwads are cattle-herders but their number is declining.{{sfnp|Mitra|2005|p=84|ps=}}}} However, although one of the [[Maldhari]] nomadic communities, they are also among the most urbanised of the region and, combined with their niche position in the supply of milk, which forms their main source of income, this has enabled them to improve their traditional social position.{{sfnp|Mitra|2005|pp=65, 84|ps=}}\n\n== Customs ==\n\n=== Religion ===\nThe Bharwad are Hindu, and like other Hindu pastoral communities pay special reverence to Krishna. Each clan also has its own deity, while their chief goddess is Masai Mata. Their most sacred place is at [[Morvi]] and they also make pilgrimages to place such as Dwarka. Some Bharwads in the south have become [[vegetarian]] as a consequence of outside influences.{{sfnp|Lal|Padmanabham|Krishnan|Mohideen|2003|pp=194-199|ps=}}\n\n=== Family arrangements ===\nMembers of the community practice [[monogamy]] and [[arranged marriage]]s are traditional, usually accompanied by a ritualised exchange of gifts between the partners.{{sfnp|Lal|Padmanabham|Krishnan|Mohideen|2003|pp=194-199|ps=}} There is anecdotal evidence that ''pet chandla'' (marriage of children while they are still in the womb) is practised by some members of the community.{{sfnp|Tarlo|1996|p=272|ps=}} In other cases, a ''sagai'' (engagement) ceremony takes place when children are aged 2\u20133, with the marriage age usually being between 18-20 for women and 20-22 for men.{{efn|Marriages of six-year-olds have been recorded but most do not marry so young.{{sfnp|Tarlo|1996|pp=155, 253|ps=}}}} Remarriage in situations where the couple are childless requires the consent of the wife, and divorce is not usually tolerated except in this situation and that of mental infirmity. Remarriage upon widowhood is also accepted but men are expected generally to prefer a younger unmarried sister of their late wife.{{sfnp|Lal|Padmanabham|Krishnan|Mohideen|2003|pp=194-199|ps=}}\n\nMarried couples live in a [[patrilocal]] arrangement. The Bharwads practice male [[equigeniture]], meaning that property is inherited equally by the male children, and it is the eldest son who becomes head of household on the death of the father. Women have no rights of inheritance over property. Although consulted, they also have no final say in the making of significant decisions.{{sfnp|Lal|Padmanabham|Krishnan|Mohideen|2003|pp=194-199|ps=}}\n\n=== Clothing ===\nThe Bharwads practice \"sartorial conservatism\", according to Emma Tarlo, and it is not enough to be born a Bharwad if a person wants to be accepted as one: conforming with standards of dress and other customs is a necessity if a person is not to be considered a deserter from the community.{{sfnp|Tarlo|1996|pp=258, 262-263|ps=}} The details of clothing&nbsp;\u2014 in terms of style, colour and material&nbsp;\u2014 have changed over time while retaining a distinct Bharwad character. Despite it being a relatively recent practice, the wearing of pink and red shawls by both women and men is one of the most obvious identifiers of the modern community and they are worn even by those who shun the other aspects of the Bharwadi dress code in favour of Western styles.{{sfnp|Tarlo|1996|p=271-272|ps=}} The desire to identify through clothing and also through [[tattoo]]s may be a reflection of the community's traditional itinerant lifestyle, whereby a means of recognising their fellows was a significant social factor.{{sfnp|Tarlo|1996|p=273|ps=}}\n\nThe clothing worn by Bharwad women was traditionally made from coarse wool woven by members of local [[Untouchability|untouchable]] communities. In addition, they embroidered their own open-backed [[bodice]]s. The garments at that time&nbsp;\u2014 as late as the early 20th century&nbsp;\u2014 comprised the bodice, an unstitched black or red waist-cloth, known as a ''jimi'', and a veil. Motabhai clothing was made from thicker wool than that of the Nanabhai, leading to the two groups referring to themselves as \"thick cloth\" and \"thin cloth\". The veil was dyed black and bore red dots if the woman was a Motabhai and yellow if she was Nanabhai. While the styles and colours remain similar, modern Bharwad women use [[man-made fibre]]s, such as [[polyester]], and cotton. This change may be in part because the modern materials are of finer texture but it is more likely than it came about because of their relative cheapness. Cost is an important factor among the generally penurious community and women could sell the woollen fabric that they had used for clothing for a greater price than they paid for the replacement man-made fabric clothes.{{sfnp|Tarlo|1996|pp=xiii, 147, 267|ps=}} Tarlo quotes a Bharwad woman saying that \"If you wear a sari then you can no longer be called a Bharwad. That is the way it is among our caste. Better to die than change your clothes.\"{{sfnp|Tarlo|1996|p=257|ps=}}\n\nThe men commonly wear a silver ear-ring, called a ''variya'', and a [[pagri (turban)]]. The length of the turban differs between the two divisions,{{sfnp|Lal|Padmanabham|Krishnan|Mohideen|2003|pp=194-199|ps=}} and there are numerous ways of tying them. A white turban, rather than the more usual pink or red, is a symbol of seniority.{{sfnp|Tarlo|1996|p=271|ps=}} Wearing Western-style clothing is still not generally accepted but the traditional three woollen blankets, worn around the head, waist and shoulders, have in many cases been replaced by a cotton ''[[kediyun]]'' together with a ''[[dhoti]]'' or ''[[chorni]]''.{{sfnp|Tarlo|1996|p=151|ps=}} As with the women, Carol Henderson notes that {{quote|[Bharwads] say that if a man doesn't wear their dress, he ceases to be Bharwad. Being Bharwad means dressing Bharwad. Bharwad men wear a distinctive short gathered smock with long, tight sleeves, massive wound turban, gathered pantaloons, and a shawl.{{sfnp|Henderson|2002|p=113|ps=}}}}\n\n== Occupations ==\n[[Image:Map Guj Gir NatPark Sanctuary.png|thumb|right|Many of the Bharwad community are found in the [[Gir Forest National Park]].]]\nBharwads are rarely educated beyond primary level and literacy rates are poor. Many of them live in and around the [[Gir Forest National Park]], where they tend to keep away from the forest itself when grazing their livestock due to the danger of attacks by [[Asiatic lion]]s. Aside from their involvement with livestock, the main source of income is agricultural labouring; few of them own land.{{sfnp|Mitra|2005|pp=65, 84|ps=}}\n\n== Community associations ==\nThere is a hierarchy of ''nyat [[panchayat]]s'' (community councils) for the resolution of disputes. These are headed by chiefs and comprise several other members. The lowest tier of this are those that operate at the level of a single village or of a group of villages if the Bharwad population is small. Matters that cannot be settled at that level are referred upwards to a regional ''panchayat'' and thereafter to a central body based at [[Rajkot]]. If matters are still not resolved after referral to Rajkot then the parties will seek intervention form law enforcement agencies, although this is rare.{{sfnp|Lal|Padmanabham|Krishnan|Mohideen|2003|pp=194-199|ps=}}\n\nThere also exists a community welfare association called the Gujarat Rajya Gopalak Sakahari Sangh, which was formed in 1950 at [[Ahmedabad]]. This has worked to document the history and traditions of the Bhardwads and has also established several hundred co-operative societies. In addition, it has worked to bring an end to some traditional social practices that are now deemed to be inappropriate, such as [[bride price]].{{sfnp|Lal|Padmanabham|Krishnan|Mohideen|2003|pp=194-199|ps=}}\n\n== See also ==\n* [[Dhangar]]\n* [[Rabari]]\n\n== References ==\n'''Notes'''\n\n\n'''Bibliography'''\n[[Category:Tribal communities of Gujarat]]\n[[Category:Maldhari communities]]\n[[Category:Tribes of Kutch]]\n[[Category:Herding castes]]\n", "name_user": "\u0ab5\u0abf\u0aaa\u0ac1\u0ab2 \u0aad\u0ab0\u0ab5\u0abe\u0aa1", "label": "safe", "comment": "Ahir yadav cast of gujrat", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bharwad"}

Potter, D.C. Wiggart, Schuam's outlines, McGraw Hill (USA), 2008, {{ISBN|978-0-07-148781-8}}</ref> In this article, the (more intuitive) definition is used.\n\nMass flow rate is defined by the [[limit of a function|limit]]:<ref>http://www.engineersedge.com/fluid_flow/mass_flow_rate.htm</ref><ref>http://www.grc.nasa.gov/WWW/k-12/airplane/mflow.html</ref>\n\n:<math>\\dot{m} = \\lim\\limits_{\\Delta t \\rightarrow 0}\\frac{\\Delta m}{ \\Delta t}= \\frac{{\\rm d}m}{{\\rm d}t}</math>\n\ni.e. the flow of mass ''m'' through a surface per unit time ''t''.\n\nThe overdot on the ''m'' is [[Newton's notation]] for a [[time derivative]]. Since mass is a [[scalar (physics)|scalar]] quantity, the mass flow rate (the time derivative of mass) is also a scalar quantity. The change in mass is the amount that flows ''after'' crossing the boundary for some time duration, not the initial amount of mass at the boundary minus the final amount at the boundary, since the change in mass flowing through the area would be zero for [[steady flow]].\n\n==Alternative equations==\n\nMass flow rate can also be calculated by:\n\n:<math>\\dot m = \\rho \\cdot \\dot V = \\rho \\cdot \\mathbf{v} \\cdot \\mathbf{A} = \\mathbf{j}_{\\rm m} \\cdot \\mathbf{A} </math>\n\nwhere:\n*''<math>\\dot V</math>'' or '''Q''' = [[Volumetric flow rate|Volume flow rate]],\n*''&rho;'' = mass [[density]] of the fluid,\n*'''v''' = [[Flow velocity]] of the mass elements,\n*'''A''' = [[Cross section (geometry)|cross-sectional]] [[vector area]]/surface,\n* '''j'''<sub>m</sub> = [[mass flux]].\n\nThe above equation is only true for a flat, plane area. In general, including cases where the area is curved, the equation becomes a [[surface integral]]:\n\n:<math>\\dot m = \\iint_A \\rho \\mathbf{v} \\cdot {\\rm d}\\mathbf{A} = \\iint_A \\mathbf{j}_{\\rm m} \\cdot {\\rm d}\\mathbf{A} </math>\n\nThe [[area]] required to calculate the mass flow rate is real or imaginary, flat or curved, either as a cross-sectional area or a surface. E.g. for substances passing through a [[Filter paper|filter]] or a [[Artificial membrane|membrane]], the real surface is the (generally curved) surface area of the filter, [[Macroscopic scale|macroscopically]] - ignoring the area spanned by the holes in the filter/membrane. The spaces would be cross-sectional areas. For liquids passing through a pipe, the area is the cross-section of the pipe, at the section considered. The [[vector area]] is a combination of the magnitude of the area through which the mass passes through, ''A'', and a [[unit vector]] normal to the area, <math>\\mathbf{\\hat{n}}</math>. The relation is <math>\\mathbf{A} = A \\mathbf{\\hat{n}}</math>.\n\nThe reason for the [[dot product]] is as follows. The only mass flowing ''through'' the cross-section is the amount normal to the area, i.e. [[Parallel (geometry)|parallel]] to the unit normal. This amount is:  \n:<math>\\dot m = \\rho v A \\cos\\theta </math>\nwhere ''\u03b8'' is the angle between the unit normal <math>\\mathbf{\\hat{n}}</math> and the velocity of mass elements. The amount passing through the cross-section is reduced by the factor <math>\\cos\\theta </math>, as ''\u03b8'' increases less mass passes through. All mass which passes in tangential directions to the area, that is [[perpendicular]] to the unit normal, ''doesn't'' actually pass ''through'' the area, so the mass passing through the area is zero. This occurs when ''\u03b8'' = ''\u03c0''/2:\n:<math>\\dot m = \\rho v A \\cos(\\pi/2) = 0</math>\nThese results are equivalent to the equation containing the dot product. Sometimes these equations are used to define the mass flow rate.\n\nConsidering flow through porous media, a special quantity, superficial mass flow rate, can be introduced. It is related with [[superficial velocity]], v<sub>s</sub>, with the following relationship:\n:<math>\\dot m_s = v_s \\cdot \\rho = \\dot m/A </math><ref>Lindeburg M. R.

The amount passing through the cross-section is reduced by the factor <math>\\cos\\theta </math>, as ''\u03b8'' increases less mass passes through. All mass which passes in tangential directions to the area, that is [[perpendicular]] to the unit normal, ''doesn't'' actually pass ''through'' the area, so the mass passing through the area is zero. This occurs when ''\u03b8'' = ''\u03c0''/2:\n:<math>\\dot m = \\rho v A \\cos(\\pi/2) = 0</math>\nThese results are equivalent to the equation containing the dot product. Sometimes these equations are used to define the mass flow rate.\n\nConsidering flow through porous media, a special quantity, superficial mass flow rate, can be introduced. It is related with [[superficial velocity]], v<sub>s</sub>, with the following relationship:\n:<math>\\dot m_s = v_s \\cdot \\rho = \\dot m/A </math><ref>Lindeburg M. R.
