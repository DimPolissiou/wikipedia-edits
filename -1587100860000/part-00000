So, Ambrosiana remained over top in the last round with 39 points, followed by Juventus with 38 and Bologna. The squad clinched the title on final round, winning the match of [[Bari]]. \n\nWhen Ambrosiana beat Bari, Meazza scored five goals in a 9\u20132 victory<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.repubblica.it/static/speciale/2010/sudafrica/nazionale/record.html|title=Record e Curiosit\u00e0|trans-title=Records and Trivia|publisher=La Repubblica|language=Italian|accessdate=6 May 2016}}</ref>. The next week he scored a hat-trick against Lucchese.

Windom, a well-known ballad singer.<ref name=AbbottSeroff />  Another tear-jerker was \"In the Baggage Coach Ahead\", Davis's most commercially successful composition, selling over a million copies.<ref name=JasenJones/>{{efn|It is not clear how much Davis profited directly from this composition; some sources say he sold it for a bargain, others that he was fairly compensated.<ref name=Cohen/>}}  The success of \"In the Baggage Coach\" was fueled by the popular female vaudeville singer, Imogene Comer, who made it part of her regular repertoire.<ref name=Southern /><ref name=Cohen />\n\n==Death==\nAn April 1899 article in ''The Freeman'' reported that Davis had purchased a home in Twentieth Street, [[Whitestone, New York]] and that he was recovering from a serious illness.<ref name=BlackPerspect />  In August of that year, press releases indicated he would appear in ''A Hot Old Time in Dixie'', going on the road in the coming season; this musical farce was Davis's property with [[Tom McIntosh (comedian)|Tom McIntosh]].<ref name=BlackPerspect />  On October 18, 1899, Davis died at home in Whitestone of heart failure as a result of pulmonary trouble (most probably tuberculosis).<ref name=BlackPerspect />\n\nAt the time of his death, Gussie Davis had published more than three hundred songs<ref name=BlackPerspect /> and certainly left more in manuscript.\n\n==Selected songs==\n*\"We Sat Beneath The Maple on The Hill\" (1880)\n*\"Light House by The Sea\" (1886)\n*\"Little Footsteps in The Snow\" (1886){{efn|Not the Bluegrass classic, but a different song.<ref name=OldTimeHerald/>}}\n*\"Wait Till The Tide Comes In\" (1887), words by George Propheter\n*\"Why Does Papa Stay So Late?\" (1889)\n*\"Fatal Wedding\" (1893), words by William H.

Davis).jpg|thumb|Cover of sheet music for one of Davis' songs]]\n\nIn 1886, when Propheter branched out his business to New York and Tin Pan Alley, Davis went with him.<ref name=JasenJones/><ref name=Sanjek/>  He worked steadily, performing as well as writing songs, and making a name for himself.{{efn|His profile was low enough, however, that some who saw only his name mistook him for a woman.<ref name=Sampson/>}} By 1895, he was sufficiently well-known to be selected to compete in a contest sponsored by the ''[[New York World]]'' to find the ten best songwriters in the nation; he placed second with his song, \"Send Back the Picture and the Ring\", and won a prize of $500 in gold.<ref name=Sanjek/> He performed as a pianist in venues such as Bergen Star Concerts<ref name=BlackPerspect /> and toured with minstrel groups including his own Davis Operatic and Plantation Minstrels.<ref name=LibOfCong/>\n\nDavis wrote a variety of musical forms, including sentimental ballads, comic minstrel songs, [[art songs]], and [[choral music]].<ref name=LibOfCong/>  He was best known in his own time for his \"tear-jerkers\".<ref name=JasenJones/><ref name=Southern/>  One of these was \"Fatal Wedding\" (1893), his first national hit; Davis composed the music, a waltz, while the words are credited to William H. Windom, a well-known ballad singer.<ref name=AbbottSeroff />  Another tear-jerker was \"In the Baggage Coach Ahead\", Davis's most commercially successful composition, selling over a million copies.<ref name=JasenJones/>{{efn|It is not clear how much Davis profited directly from this composition; some sources say he sold it for a bargain, others that he was fairly compensated.<ref name=Cohen/>}}  The success of \"In the Baggage Coach\" was fueled by the popular female vaudeville singer, Imogene Comer, who made it part of her regular repertoire.<ref name=Southern /><ref name=Cohen />\n\n==Death==\nAn April 1899 article in ''The Freeman'' reported that Davis had purchased a home in [[Whitestone, New York]] and that he was recovering from a serious illness.<ref name=BlackPerspect />  In August of that year, press releases indicated he would appear in ''A Hot Old Time in Dixie'', going on the road in the coming season; this musical farce was Davis's property with [[Tom McIntosh (comedian)|Tom McIntosh]].<ref name=BlackPerspect />  On October 18, 1899, Davis died at home in Whitestone.<ref name=BlackPerspect />\n\nAt the time of his death, Gussie Davis had published more than three hundred songs<ref name=BlackPerspect /> and certainly left more in manuscript.\n\n==Selected songs==\n*\"We Sat Beneath The Maple on The Hill\" (1880)\n*\"Light House by The Sea\" (1886)\n*\"Little Footsteps in The Snow\" (1886){{efn|Not the Bluegrass classic, but a different song.<ref name=OldTimeHerald/>}}\n*\"Wait Till The Tide Comes In\" (1887), words by George Propheter\n*\"Why Does Papa Stay So Late?\" (1889)\n*\"Fatal Wedding\" (1893), words by William H.

The two species of [[lizard]] within the genus ''Iguana'' possess a [[dewlap]] and a row of elongated scales running from the midline of their [[neck]]s down to their [[tail]]s. Iguanas have varying types of scales covering different areas of their body, for example, there are some large round [[Reptile scale|tuberculate scales]] scattered around the lateral region of the neck among smaller, overlapping scales.<ref name=\":5\"/> The scales on the [[Anatomical terms of location#Dorsal and ventral|dorsal]] trunk of their body are also thicker and more tightly packed than those on the [[ventral]] side.<ref name=\":5\" /> These scales may be a variety of colors and are not always visible from close distances. They have a large round scale on their cheeks known as a sub-tympanic shield.<ref name=\"Lazell\"/>\n\nIguanas have keen vision and can see shapes, shadows, colors, and movement at long distances. Their visual acuity enables them to navigate through crowded forests and to locate food. They employ visual signals to communicate with other members of the same species.<ref name=\"Lazell\" />\n\nThe [[Tympanum (zoology)|tympanum]], the iguana's [[eardrum]], is located above the sub-tympanic shield (or \"ear shield\") behind each eye. Iguanas are often hard to spot, as they tend to blend into their surroundings and their coloration enables them to hide from larger predators.<ref name=\"Lazell\" />\n\nLike most [[reptile]]s, an iguana has a three-chambered [[heart]] with two atria, one ventricle, and two aortae with a [[systemic circulation]].<ref name=dabvp2561/>\nThe muscles of an iguana are very light in color, this is due to the high proportion of [[Fast twitch muscle|fast glycolytic muscle fibers]]. These fibers are not very vascularized and are low in [[myoglobin]], giving them their pale look. This high density of fast glycolytic muscle fibers allows iguanas to move very quickly for a short period of time, which facilitates short bursts of movement but is inefficient for long duration movement, since cellular respiration in fast glycolytic muscle fibers is [[Anaerobic respiration|anaerobic]]. \n\n=== Parietal eye ===\nSeveral species of lizard, including the iguana, have a pale scale towards the back of their head marking the [[parietal eye]]. This organ is sensitive to changes in illumination and sends signals to the [[pineal gland]] signaling the change between day and night. A photopigment commonly found in the [[lamprey]], known as parapinopsin, is also found in the iguana and is photosensitive to UV light and aids in the signaling between day and night.<ref name=wada4265/>\n\n=== Skull morphology and diet ===\n[[File:Iguana iguana eating Mangifera indica from Venezuela.jpg|thumb|278x278px|Iguanas have an exclusively herbivorous diet,<ref name=\":1\"/> as illustrated above by a [[green iguana]] eating a [[mango]] in [[Venezuela]]]]\nIguanas have developed an [[Herbivore|herbivorous]] lifestyle, foraging exclusively on vegetation and foliage.<ref name=\":1\" /> In order to acquire, process and digest plant matter, herbivorous lizards must have a higher bite force relative to their size in comparison to [[Carnivore|carnivorous]] or [[Omnivore|omnivorous]] reptiles. The skull of the iguana has undergone modifications resulting in a strong bite force and efficient processing of [[vegetation]], according to one study.<ref name=\":0\"/>\n\nIn order to accomplish this [[Biomechanics|biomechanically]], herbivorous lizards (such as the iguana) have taller and wider skulls, shorter snouts, and larger bodies relative to carnivorous and omnivorous reptiles.<ref name=\":0\" />  Increasing the robusticity of the skull allows for increased muscle presence and increases the ability of the skull to withstand stronger forces.<ref name=herrel2461/>\n[[File:Green Iguana skull (Iguana iguana) and teeth.png|alt=Green Iguana skull (Iguana iguana).jpg: Brian Gratwicke derivative work: B kimmel (talk)|thumb|276x276px|[[Green iguana]] skull and teeth. The teeth of the [[green iguana]] sit on the surface of the jawbone, known as [[acrodont]]al placement.<ref name=\":2\"/> ]]\nFurthermore, the teeth of the iguana are [[acrodont]]al, meaning that their teeth sit on top of the surface of the jaw bone<ref name=\":2\" /> and project upwards. The teeth themselves are small and serrated - designed to grasp and shear food.<ref name=banzato2631/>\n\n=== Reproduction ===\nMale iguanas, like other male examples of [[Squamata]], have two [[Hemipenis|hemipenes]]. During copulation one hemipene will be inserted into the female's [[Cloaca|cloacal vent]]. Females can store sperm from previous mates for several years to continue to fertilize her eggs in case she finds no male within her territory when she is ready to lay again.{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\n=== Mating/courtship ===\nIguanas tend to follow a promiscuous or [[Polygynandry|polygynadrous]] mating style during the dry season. Mating during the dry season ensures that their offspring will hatch during the wet or rainy season when food will be more plentiful. Females control large territories where they make several nests. Males compete amongst each other for the females in an area and mark their won territory with a [[pheromone]] secreted from the [[femoral pore]]s on the dorsal side of their hind limbs. Male behavior during sexual competition involves head bobbing, extending and retracting their [[dewlap]], nuzzling and biting the necks of females, and on occasion, changing color. Once a female chooses a male, he will straddle the female and hold her in place by biting onto her shoulder, which sometimes leaves scars on females. After copulation, eggs are laid within several nests and allowed to incubate. This low level of parental intervention with their offspring makes iguanas an example of [[R/K selection theory|r-strategy]] reproduction.{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\n==Phylogeny==\nA [[Phylogenetic tree|phylogeny]] based on nuclear [[Human genome|protein-coding genes]], reviewed by Vidal and Hedges (2009) suggested that the [[subclade]] [[Iguanomorpha|Iguania]] is in a group with [[snake]]s and [[Anguimorpha|anguimorphs]] (lizards). These groups share an oral gland capable of secreting toxins (a derived trait).<ref name=\":3\"/> On the other hand, the phylogeny based on whole [[Mitochondrial DNA|mitochondrial genomes]], proposed by Rest et al. (2003), places the [[green iguana]] as the closest relative of the [[Plestiodon egregius|mole skink]] (''Plestiodon egregius'').<ref name=molecular1326/> [[Lepidosauria|Lepidosaurs]] are reptiles with overlapping scales, and within this group both iguanians and [[tuatara]]s (''Sphenodon''s) project their tongue to seize prey items instead of using their jaw, which is called tongue [[Prehensility|prehension]]. However, iguanians are the only lineage within [[Squamata]] that displays this trait, meaning that it was gained independently in both iguanians and tuataras.<ref name=\":3\" /> Iguanians are also the only squamates that primarily use their sight to identify and track prey rather than chemoreception or scent, and employ an [[Ambush predator|ambush technique]] of catching prey instead of active searching.<ref name=\":3\" />\n[[File:Traditional Reptilia.tif|thumb|246x246px|Simple phylogeny with [[Reptile|Reptilia]] highlighted in green. Iguanians are within [[Lepidosauria]].]]\n\n=== Extant species ===\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! Image !! Scientific name  !! Common Name  !!

The two described subspecies of ''I. insularis'' (the [[Green iguana|Saint Lucia horned iguana]] (''I. i. sanctaluciae'') and the [[Green iguana|Grenadines horned iguana]] (''I. i. insularis'')) are now considered subspecies of ''I. iguana'', although they are genetically very similar and may not be separate subspecies from one another.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://reptile-database.reptarium.cz/species.php?genus=Iguana&species=iguana|title=Iguana iguana|website=The Reptile Database|access-date=2020-04-15}}</ref> However, recent studies have still recovered ''I. rhinolopha'' and ''I. insularis'' as distinct species.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Breuil|first=Michel|last2=Vuillaume|first2=Barbara|last3=Schikorski|first3=David|last4=Krauss|first4=Ulrike|last5=Morton|first5=Matthew N.|last6=Haynes|first6=Pius|last7=Daltry|first7=Jennifer C.|last8=Corry|first8=Elisabeth|last9=Gaymes|first9=Glenroy|last10=Gaymes|first10=Joanne|last11=Bech|first11=Nicolas|date=2018-11-08|title=A story of nasal horns: A new species of Iguana Laurenti, 1768 (Squamata, Iguanidae) in Saint Lucia, St Vincent &amp; the Grenadines, and Grenada (Southern Lesser Antilles) and its implications for the taxonomy of the genus Iguana|url=https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/466128v1|journal=bioRxiv|language=en|pages=466128|doi=10.1101/466128}}</ref>\n\n==As food==\n{{Main|Iguana meat}}\nIguanas have historically featured in the culinary traditions of Mexico and Central America.

The genus was first described in 1768 by Austrian [[naturalist]] [[Josephus Nicolaus Laurenti]] in his book ''Specimen Medicum, Exhibens Synopsin Reptilium Emendatam cum Experimentis circa Venena''. Three [[species]] are included in the genus ''Iguana'': the [[green iguana]], which is widespread throughout its range and a popular pet, the [[Lesser Antillean iguana]], which is native to the [[Lesser Antilles]], and the [[Saban black iguana]]<ref name=\"Breuil2020\">{{cite journal|last1= Breuil|first1= M.|last2= Schikorski|first2= D.|last3= Vuillaume|first3= B.|last4= Krauss|first4= U.|last5= Morton|first5= M.N.|last6= Corry|first6= E.|last7= Bech|first7= N.|last8= Jeli\u0107|first8= M.|last9= Grandjean|first9= F.|title= Painted black: ''Iguana melanoderma'' (Reptilia, Squamata, Iguanidae) a new melanistic endemic species from Saba and Montserrat islands (Lesser Antilles) |journal= ZooKeys|volume= 926|year= 2020|pages= 95\u2013131|doi= 10.3897/zookeys.926.48679}}</ref>, which is native to the Caribbean islands of [[Saba]] and [[Montserrat]]. The latter two species are endangered due to [[habitat destruction]], introduced [[feral]] predators, hunting, and hybridization with introduced green iguanas.\n\nThe word \"iguana\" is derived from the original [[Ta\u00edno people|Taino]] name for the species, ''iwana''.<ref name=\"Coles\"/>\nIn addition to the two species in the genus ''Iguana'', several other related genera in the same family have common names of the species including the word \"iguana\".\n\n\n[[File:Iguana marina (Amblyrhynchus cristatus), isla Santa Cruz, islas Gal\u00e1pagos, Ecuador, 2015-07-26, DD 46.JPG | thumb | 220x124px | right]]\n==Anatomy and physiology==\nIguanas can range from {{convert|5|to|6|ft|m|order=flip}} in length, including their tail. The two species of [[lizard]] within the genus ''Iguana'' possess a [[dewlap]] and a row of elongated scales running from the midline of their [[neck]]s down to their [[tail]]s. Iguanas have varying types of scales covering different areas of their body, for example, there are some large round [[Reptile scale|tuberculate scales]] scattered around the lateral region of the neck among smaller, overlapping scales.<ref name=\":5\"/> The scales on the [[Anatomical terms of location#Dorsal and ventral|dorsal]] trunk of their body are also thicker and more tightly packed than those on the [[ventral]] side.<ref name=\":5\" /> These scales may be a variety of colors and are not always visible from close distances. They have a large round scale on their cheeks known as a sub-tympanic shield.<ref name=\"Lazell\"/>\n\nIguanas have keen vision and can see shapes, shadows, colors, and movement at long distances. Their visual acuity enables them to navigate through crowded forests and to locate food. They employ visual signals to communicate with other members of the same species.<ref name=\"Lazell\" />\n\nThe [[Tympanum (zoology)|tympanum]], the iguana's [[eardrum]], is located above the sub-tympanic shield (or \"ear shield\") behind each eye. Iguanas are often hard to spot, as they tend to blend into their surroundings and their coloration enables them to hide from larger predators.<ref name=\"Lazell\" />\n\nLike most [[reptile]]s, an iguana has a three-chambered [[heart]] with two atria, one ventricle, and two aortae with a [[systemic circulation]].<ref name=dabvp2561/>\nThe muscles of an iguana are very light in color, this is due to the high proportion of [[Fast twitch muscle|fast glycolytic muscle fibers]]. These fibers are not very vascularized and are low in [[myoglobin]], giving them their pale look. This high density of fast glycolytic muscle fibers allows iguanas to move very quickly for a short period of time, which facilitates short bursts of movement but is inefficient for long duration movement, since cellular respiration in fast glycolytic muscle fibers is [[Anaerobic respiration|anaerobic]]. \n\n=== Parietal eye ===\nSeveral species of lizard, including the iguana, have a pale scale towards the back of their head marking the [[parietal eye]]. This organ is sensitive to changes in illumination and sends signals to the [[pineal gland]] signaling the change between day and night. A photopigment commonly found in the [[lamprey]], known as parapinopsin, is also found in the iguana and is photosensitive to UV light and aids in the signaling between day and night.<ref name=wada4265/>\n\n=== Skull morphology and diet ===\n[[File:Iguana iguana eating Mangifera indica from Venezuela.jpg|thumb|278x278px|Iguanas have an exclusively herbivorous diet,<ref name=\":1\"/> as illustrated above by a [[green iguana]] eating a [[mango]] in [[Venezuela]]]]\nIguanas have developed an [[Herbivore|herbivorous]] lifestyle, foraging exclusively on vegetation and foliage.<ref name=\":1\" /> In order to acquire, process and digest plant matter, herbivorous lizards must have a higher bite force relative to their size in comparison to [[Carnivore|carnivorous]] or [[Omnivore|omnivorous]] reptiles. The skull of the iguana has undergone modifications resulting in a strong bite force and efficient processing of [[vegetation]], according to one study.<ref name=\":0\"/>\n\nIn order to accomplish this [[Biomechanics|biomechanically]], herbivorous lizards (such as the iguana) have taller and wider skulls, shorter snouts, and larger bodies relative to carnivorous and omnivorous reptiles.<ref name=\":0\" />  Increasing the robusticity of the skull allows for increased muscle presence and increases the ability of the skull to withstand stronger forces.<ref name=herrel2461/>\n[[File:Green Iguana skull (Iguana iguana) and teeth.png|alt=Green Iguana skull (Iguana iguana).jpg: Brian Gratwicke derivative work: B kimmel (talk)|thumb|276x276px|[[Green iguana]] skull and teeth. The teeth of the [[green iguana]] sit on the surface of the jawbone, known as [[acrodont]]al placement.<ref name=\":2\"/> ]]\nFurthermore, the teeth of the iguana are [[acrodont]]al, meaning that their teeth sit on top of the surface of the jaw bone<ref name=\":2\" /> and project upwards. The teeth themselves are small and serrated - designed to grasp and shear food.<ref name=banzato2631/>\n\n=== Reproduction ===\nMale iguanas, like other male examples of [[Squamata]], have two [[Hemipenis|hemipenes]]. During copulation one hemipene will be inserted into the female's [[Cloaca|cloacal vent]]. Females can store sperm from previous mates for several years to continue to fertilize her eggs in case she finds no male within her territory when she is ready to lay again.{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\n=== Mating/courtship ===\nIguanas tend to follow a promiscuous or [[Polygynandry|polygynadrous]] mating style during the dry season. Mating during the dry season ensures that their offspring will hatch during the wet or rainy season when food will be more plentiful. Females control large territories where they make several nests. Males compete amongst each other for the females in an area and mark their won territory with a [[pheromone]] secreted from the [[femoral pore]]s on the dorsal side of their hind limbs. Male behavior during sexual competition involves head bobbing, extending and retracting their [[dewlap]], nuzzling and biting the necks of females, and on occasion, changing color. Once a female chooses a male, he will straddle the female and hold her in place by biting onto her shoulder, which sometimes leaves scars on females. After copulation, eggs are laid within several nests and allowed to incubate. This low level of parental intervention with their offspring makes iguanas an example of [[R/K selection theory|r-strategy]] reproduction.{{Citation needed|date=May 2019}}\n\n==Phylogeny==\nA [[Phylogenetic tree|phylogeny]] based on nuclear [[Human genome|protein-coding genes]], reviewed by Vidal and Hedges (2009) suggested that the [[subclade]] [[Iguanomorpha|Iguania]] is in a group with [[snake]]s and [[Anguimorpha|anguimorphs]] (lizards). These groups share an oral gland capable of secreting toxins (a derived trait).<ref name=\":3\"/> On the other hand, the phylogeny based on whole [[Mitochondrial DNA|mitochondrial genomes]], proposed by Rest et al. (2003), places the [[green iguana]] as the closest relative of the [[Plestiodon egregius|mole skink]] (''Plestiodon egregius'').<ref name=molecular1326/> [[Lepidosauria|Lepidosaurs]] are reptiles with overlapping scales, and within this group both iguanians and [[tuatara]]s (''Sphenodon''s) project their tongue to seize prey items instead of using their jaw, which is called tongue [[Prehensility|prehension]]. However, iguanians are the only lineage within [[Squamata]] that displays this trait, meaning that it was gained independently in both iguanians and tuataras.<ref name=\":3\" /> Iguanians are also the only squamates that primarily use their sight to identify and track prey rather than chemoreception or scent, and employ an [[Ambush predator|ambush technique]] of catching prey instead of active searching.<ref name=\":3\" />\n[[File:Traditional Reptilia.tif|thumb|246x246px|Simple phylogeny with [[Reptile|Reptilia]] highlighted in green.

She takes the appearance of Hoffmann's closest friend, Nicklausse. The [[prima donna]] Stella, performing [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart's]] ''[[Don Giovanni]],'' sends a letter to Hoffmann, requesting a meeting in her dressing room after the performance. The letter and the key to the room are intercepted by Councillor Lindorf (\"{{Lang|fr|Dans les r\u00f4les d'amoureux langoureux|italic=no}}\" \u2013 In the languid lovers' roles), the first of the opera's incarnations of evil, Hoffmann's [[wikt:nemesis|nemesis]]. Lindorf intends to replace Hoffmann at the rendezvous. In the tavern, students wait for Hoffmann. He finally arrives, and entertains them with the legend of Kleinzach the dwarf (\"{{Lang|fr|Il \u00e9tait une fois \u00e0 la cour d'[[Eisenach]]|italic=no}}\" \u2013 Once upon a time at the court of Eisenach). Lindorf coaxes Hoffmann into telling the audience about his three great loves.\n\n===Act 1 (Olympia)===\n[[File:Pierre-Auguste Lamy (?) - Les contes d'Hoffmann by Jacques Offenbach, Olympia act.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.1|The Olympia act, as staged at the 1881 premi\u00e8re]]\nThis act is based on a portion of \"[[The Sandman (short story)|Der Sandmann]]\".\n\nHoffmann's first love is Olympia, an [[automaton]] created by the scientist Spalanzani. Hoffmann falls in love with her, not knowing Olympia is a mechanical doll (\"{{Lang|fr|Allons! Courage et confiance...Ah! vivre deux!|italic=no}}\" \u2013 Come on! Courage and confidence ... Ah! to live!). To warn Hoffmann, Nicklausse, possessing the truth about Olympia, sings a story of a mechanical doll with the appearance of a human, but Hoffmann ignores him (\"{{Lang|fr|Une poup\u00e9e aux yeux d'\u00e9mail|italic=no}}\" \u2013 A doll with enamel eyes). Copp\u00e9lius, Olympia's co-creator and this act's incarnation of Nemesis, sells Hoffmann magic glasses to make Olympia appear as a real woman (\"{{Lang|fr|J'ai des yeux|italic=no}}\" \u2013 I have eyes).\n\nOlympia sings one of the opera's most famous [[aria]]s, \"{{Lang|fr|Les oiseaux dans la charmille|italic=no}}\" (The birds in the arbor, nicknamed \"The Doll Song\"), during which she runs-down and needs to be wound-up before she can continue. Hoffmann is tricked into believing his affections are returned, to the bemusement of Nicklausse, subtly attempting to warn his friend (\"{{Lang|fr|Voyez-la sous son \u00e9ventail|italic=no}}\" \u2013 See her under her fan). While dancing with Olympia, Hoffmann falls on the ground and his glasses break. At the same time, Copp\u00e9lius appears, tearing Olympia apart to retaliate against Spalanzani after cheating him of his fees. With the crowd ridiculing him, Hoffmann realizes he loved an automaton.\n\n===Act 2 (Antonia)===\n[[File:Les contes d'Hoffmann - Antonia act - Dr. Miracle and Antonia.png|thumb|Antonia and Dr. Miracle, 1881]]\nThis act is based on \"{{Lang|de|Rath Krespel|italic=no}}\".\n\nAfter a long search, Hoffmann finds the house where Crespel and his daughter Antonia are hiding. Hoffmann and Antonia loved each other, but were separated after Crespel decided to hide his daughter from Hoffmann. Antonia inherited her mother's talent for singing, but her father forbids her to sing because of her mysterious illness. Antonia wishes her lover would return to her (\"{{Lang|fr|Elle a fui, la tourterelle|italic=no}}\" \u2013 \"She fled, the dove\"). Her father also forbids her to see Hoffmann, who encourages Antonia in her musical career, and therefore, endangers her without knowing it. Crespel tells Frantz, his servant, to stay with his daughter, and after Crespel leaves, Frantz sings a comical song about his talents \"{{Lang|fr|Jour et nuit je me mets en quatre|italic=no}}\" \u2013 \"Day and night, I quarter my mind.\"\n\nAfter Crespel leaves his house, Hoffmann takes advantage of the occasion to sneak in, and the lovers are re-united (love duet: \"{{Lang|fr|C'est une chanson d'amour|italic=no}}\" \u2013 \"It's a love song\"). After Crespel returns, he receives a visit from Dr Miracle, the act's Nemesis, forcing Crespel to let him heal her. Eavesdropping, Hoffmann learns Antonia may die if she sings too much. He returns to her boudoir, and makes her promise to give up her artistic-dreams. Antonia reluctantly accepts her lover's will. After she is alone, Dr Miracle enters Antonia's boudoir to persuade her to sing and follow her mother's path to glory, stating Hoffmann is sacrificing her to his brutishness, and loves her only for her beauty. With mystic powers, he raises a vision of Antonia's dead mother and induces Antonia to sing, causing her death. Crespel arrives just in time to witness his daughter's last breath. Hoffmann enters, and Crespel wants to kill him, thinking he is responsible for his daughter's death. Nicklausse saves his friend from the old man's vengeance.\n\n===Act 3 (Giulietta)===\n[[File:Pierre-Auguste Lamy (?) - Les contes d'Hoffmann by Jacques Offenbach, Giulietta act.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.1|Giuletta act, 1881]]\n\nThis act is loosely-based on ''{{Lang|de|Die Abenteuer der Silvester-Nacht}}'' (''A New Year's Eve Adventure'').\n\n[[Venice]]. The act opens with the [[barcarolle]] \"{{Lang|fr|[[Belle nuit, \u00f4 nuit d'amour]]|italic=no}}\" \u2013 \"Beautiful night, oh night of love\". Hoffmann falls in love with the [[courtesan]] Giulietta, and thinks she returns his affections (\"{{Lang|fr|Amis, l'amour tendre et r\u00eaveur|italic=no}}\" \u2013 \"Friends, tender and dreamy love\"). Giulietta is not in love with Hoffmann, but seducing him under the orders of Captain Dapertutto, promising to give her a diamond if she steals Hoffmann's reflection from a mirror (\"{{Lang|fr|Scintille, diamant|italic=no}}\" \u2013 \"Sparkle, diamond\"). The jealous Schlemil (cf. [[Peter Schlemihl]] for a literary antecedent), a previous victim of Giulietta and Dapertutto (he gave Giulietta his shadow), challenges the poet to a duel, but is killed. Nicklausse wants to take Hoffmann away from Venice, and goes looking for horses. Meanwhile, Hoffmann meets Giulietta, and cannot resist her (\"{{Lang|fr|O Dieu! de quelle ivresse|italic=no}}\" \u2013 \"O God! of what intoxication\"): he gives her his reflection, only to be abandoned by the courtesan, to Dapertutto's great pleasure. Hoffmann tells Dapertutto his friend Nicklausse will come and save him. Dapertutto prepares a poison to get rid of Nicklausse, but Giulietta drinks it by mistake, dropping dead in the poet's arms.\n\n===Epilogue===\nThe tavern in Nuremberg: Hoffmann, drunk, swears he will never love again, and explains Olympia, Antonia, and Giulietta are three facets of the same person, Stella. They represent, respectively, the young girl's, the musician's, and the courtesan's side of the prima donna. After Hoffmann says he doesn't want to love any more, Nicklausse reveals she is the Muse and reclaims Hoffmann: \"Be reborn a poet! I love you, Hoffmann! Be mine!\" \u2013 \"{{Lang|fr|Rena\u00eetra un po\u00e8te! Je t'aime, Hoffmann! Sois \u00e0 moi!|italic=no}}\" The magic of poetry reaches Hoffmann as he sings \"{{Lang|fr|O Dieu! de quelle ivresse|italic=no}} \u2013 \"O God! of what intoxication\" once more, ending with \"Muse, whom I love, I am yours!\" \u2013 \"{{Lang|fr|Muse que j'aime, je suis \u00e0 toi!|italic=no}}\" At this moment, Stella, tired of waiting for Hoffmann to come to her rendezvous, enters the tavern and finds him drunk. The poet tells her to leave (\"Farewell, I will not follow you, phantom, spectre of the past\" \u2013 \"{{Lang|fr|Adieu, je ne vais pas vous suivre, fant\u00f4me, spectre du pass\u00e9|italic=no}}\"), and Lindorf, waiting in the shadows, comes forth. Nicklausse explains to Stella that Hoffmann does not love her anymore, but Councillor Lindorf is waiting for her. Some students enter the room for more drinking, while Stella and Lindorf leave together.\n\n== Musical numbers ==\nThe aria \"{{Lang|fr|Chanson de Kleinzach|italic=no}}\" (Song of little Zaches) in the prologue is based on the short story \"{{Lang|de|Klein Zaches, genannt Zinnober|italic=no}}\" (\"Little Zaches, called cinnabar\"), 1819. The barcarolle, \"[[Belle nuit, \u00f4 nuit d'amour]]\" in the Venetian act, is the opera's famous number, borrowed by Offenbach from his earlier opera ''[[Die Rheinnixen|Rheinnixen]]'' (French: ''Les f\u00e9es du Rhin'').<ref name=\"WeaverDecca1986\" />\n\n==Editions==\n{{refimprove section|date=January 2019}}\n[[File:ETA-Hoffmann.JPG|thumb|The original [[E. T. A. Hoffmann]] (1776\u20131822)]]\nOffenbach did not live to see his opera performed. He died on 5 October 1880, four months before its premiere, but after completing the piano score and orchestrating the prologue and first act. As a result, different editions of the opera emerged, some bearing little resemblance to the authentic work. The version performed at the opera's premiere was by [[Ernest Guiraud]], after completing Offenbach's scoring and recitatives. Over the decades, new editions continue to appear, although the emphasis, particularly since the 1970s, shifted to authenticity. In this regard, a milestone was the Michael Kaye edition of 1992, but, then, additional authentic music was found, and published in 1999. In 2011, two competing publishing houses \u2013 one French, one German \u2013 released a joint edition reflecting and reconciling the research of recent decades. Here are some of the edition \"variables\" circulating since Offenbach died:\n\n* Addition of extra music not intended by Offenbach for the opera\n:Commonly, directors choose among two numbers in the Giulietta act:\n:\"{{Lang|fr|Scintille, diamant|italic=no}}\", based on a tune from the overture to Offenbach's operetta ''[[Le voyage dans la lune (operetta)|A Journey to the Moon]]'' and included by [[Andr\u00e9 Bloch (composer)|Andr\u00e9 Bloch]] for a Monaco production in 1908.\n:The Sextet (sometimes called Septet, counting the chorus as a character) of unknown origin, but containing elements of the barcarolle.\n* Changes to the sequence of the acts\n:The three acts, telling different stories from the life of Hoffmann, are independent (with the exception of a mention of Olympia in the Antonia act), easily swapped without affecting the story. Offenbach's order was Prologue\u2013Olympia\u2013Antonia\u2013Giulietta\u2013Epilogue, but during the 20th century, the work was usually performed with Giulietta's act preceding Antonia's. Recently, the original order was restored, but the practice is not universal. The general reason for the switch is that the Antonia act is more-accomplished musically.\n* Naming of the acts\n:The designation of the acts is disputed. The German scholar {{Interlanguage link multi|Josef Heinzelmann|de}}, among others, favours numbering the Prologue as Act One, and the Epilogue as Act Five, with Olympia as Act Two, Antonia as Act Three, and Giulietta as Act Four.\n* Changes to the story \n:The opera was sometimes performed (for example, during the premiere at the Op\u00e9ra-Comique) without the entire Giulietta act, although the famous barcarolle from that act was inserted into the Antonia act, and Hoffmann's aria \"Amis! l'Amour tendre et r\u00eaveur\" was inserted into the epilogue. In 1881, before the opera was performed in Vienna, the Giulietta act was restored, but modified so the courtesan does not die at the end by accidental poisoning, but exits in a gondola accompanied by her servant Pitichinaccio.\n* Spoken dialogue or recitative\n:Due to its ''op\u00e9ra-comique'' genre, the original score contained much dialogue, sometimes replaced by recitative, and this lengthened the opera so much, some acts were removed (see above).\n* The number of singers performing\n:Offenbach intended the four soprano roles be played by the same singer, for Olympia, Giulietta, and Antonia are three facets of Stella, Hoffmann's unreachable love. Similarly, the four villains (Lindorf, Copp\u00e9lius, Miracle, and Dapertutto) would be performed by the same [[bass-baritone]], because they are all manifestations of evil. While the doubling of the four villains is quite common, most performances of the work use different singers for the loves of Hoffmann because different skills are needed for each role: Olympia requires a skilled-coloratura singer with stratospheric-high notes, Antonia is written for a lyrical voice, and Giulietta is usually performed by a dramatic soprano or a [[mezzo-soprano]]. Any performance with all three roles (four if the role of Stella is counted) performed by a single soprano in a performance is considered one of the largest challenges in the lyric coloratura repertoire. Notable sopranos performing all three roles include [[Karan Armstrong]], [[Vina Bovy]], [[Patrizia Ciofi]], [[Edita Gruberov\u00e1]], [[Fanny Heldy]], [[Catherine Malfitano]], [[Anja Silja]], [[Beverly Sills]], [[Ruth Ann Swenson]], [[Carol Vaness]], [[Faith Esham]], [[Ninon Vallin]] and [[Virginia Zeani]].

Lindorf coaxes Hoffmann into telling the audience about his three great loves.\n\n===Act 1 (Olympia)===\n[[File:Pierre-Auguste Lamy (?) - Les contes d'Hoffmann by Jacques Offenbach, Olympia act.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.1|The Olympia act, as staged at the 1881 premi\u00e8re]]\nThis act is based on a portion of \"[[The Sandman (short story)|Der Sandmann]]\".\n\nHoffmann's first love is Olympia, an [[automaton]] created by the scientist Spalanzani. Hoffmann falls in love with her, not knowing Olympia is a mechanical doll (\"{{Lang|fr|Allons! Courage et confiance...Ah! vivre deux!|italic=no}}\" \u2013 Come on! Courage and confidence ... Ah! to live!). To warn Hoffmann, Nicklausse, possessing the truth about Olympia, sings a story of a mechanical doll with the appearance of a human, but Hoffmann ignores him (\"{{Lang|fr|Une poup\u00e9e aux yeux d'\u00e9mail|italic=no}}\" \u2013 A doll with enamel eyes). Copp\u00e9lius, Olympia's co-creator and this act's incarnation of Nemesis, sells Hoffmann magic glasses to make Olympia appear as a real woman (\"{{Lang|fr|J'ai des yeux|italic=no}}\" \u2013 I have eyes).\n\nOlympia sings one of the opera's most famous [[aria]]s, \"{{Lang|fr|Les oiseaux dans la charmille|italic=no}}\" (The birds in the arbor, nicknamed \"The Doll Song\"), during which she runs-down and needs to be wound-up before she can continue. Hoffmann is tricked into believing his affections are returned, to the bemusement of Nicklausse, subtly attempting to warn his friend (\"{{Lang|fr|Voyez-la sous son \u00e9ventail|italic=no}}\" \u2013 See her under her fan). While dancing with Olympia, Hoffmann falls on the ground and his glasses break. At the same time, Copp\u00e9lius appears, tearing Olympia apart to retaliate against Spalanzani after cheating him of his fees. With the crowd ridiculing him, Hoffmann realizes he loved an automaton.\n\n===Act 2 (Antonia)===\n[[File:Les contes d'Hoffmann - Antonia act - Dr. Miracle and Antonia.png|thumb|Antonia and Dr. Miracle, 1881]]\nThis act is based on \"{{Lang|de|Rath Krespel|italic=no}}\".\n\nAfter a long search, Hoffmann finds the house where Crespel and his daughter Antonia are hiding. Hoffmann and Antonia loved each other, but were separated after Crespel decided to hide his daughter from Hoffmann. Antonia inherited her mother's talent for singing, but her father forbids her to sing because of her mysterious illness. Antonia wishes her lover would return to her (\"{{Lang|fr|Elle a fui, la tourterelle|italic=no}}\" \u2013 \"She fled, the dove\"). Her father also forbids her to see Hoffmann, who encourages Antonia in her musical career, and therefore, endangers her without knowing it. Crespel tells Frantz, his servant, to stay with his daughter, and after Crespel leaves, Frantz sings a comical song about his talents \"{{Lang|fr|Jour et nuit je me mets en quatre|italic=no}}\" \u2013 \"Day and night, I quarter my mind.\"\n\nAfter Crespel leaves his house, Hoffmann takes advantage of the occasion to sneak in, and the lovers are re-united (love duet: \"{{Lang|fr|C'est une chanson d'amour|italic=no}}\" \u2013 \"It's a love song\"). After Crespel returns, he receives a visit from Dr Miracle, the act's Nemesis, forcing Crespel to let him heal her. Eavesdropping, Hoffmann learns Antonia may die if she sings too much. He returns to her boudoir, and makes her promise to give up her artistic-dreams. Antonia reluctantly accepts her lover's will. After she is alone, Dr Miracle enters Antonia's boudoir to persuade her to sing and follow her mother's path to glory, stating Hoffmann is sacrificing her to his brutishness, and loves her only for her beauty. With mystic powers, he raises a vision of Antonia's dead mother and induces Antonia to sing, causing her death. Crespel arrives just in time to witness his daughter's last breath. Hoffmann enters, and Crespel wants to kill him, thinking he is responsible for his daughter's death. Nicklausse saves his friend from the old man's vengeance.\n\n===Act 3 (Giulietta)===\n[[File:Pierre-Auguste Lamy (?) - Les contes d'Hoffmann by Jacques Offenbach, Giulietta act.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.1|Giuletta act, 1881]]\n\nThis act is loosely-based on ''{{Lang|de|Die Abenteuer der Silvester-Nacht}}'' (''A New Year's Eve Adventure'').\n\n[[Venice]]. The act opens with the [[barcarolle]] \"{{Lang|fr|[[Belle nuit, \u00f4 nuit d'amour]]|italic=no}}\" \u2013 \"Beautiful night, oh night of love\". Hoffmann falls in love with the [[courtesan]] Giulietta, and thinks she returns his affections (\"{{Lang|fr|Amis, l'amour tendre et r\u00eaveur|italic=no}}\" \u2013 \"Friends, tender and dreamy love\"). Giulietta is not in love with Hoffmann, but seducing him under the orders of Captain Dapertutto, promising to give her a diamond if she steals Hoffmann's reflection from a mirror (\"{{Lang|fr|Scintille, diamant|italic=no}}\" \u2013 \"Sparkle, diamond\"). The jealous Schlemil (cf. [[Peter Schlemihl]] for a literary antecedent), a previous victim of Giulietta and Dapertutto (he gave Giulietta his shadow), challenges the poet to a duel, but is killed. Nicklausse wants to take Hoffmann away from Venice, and goes looking for horses. Meanwhile, Hoffmann meets Giulietta, and cannot resist her (\"{{Lang|fr|O Dieu! de quelle ivresse|italic=no}}\" \u2013 \"O God! of what intoxication\"): he gives her his reflection, only to be abandoned by the courtesan, to Dapertutto's great pleasure. Hoffmann tells Dapertutto his friend Nicklausse will come and save him. Dapertutto prepares a poison to get rid of Nicklausse, but Giulietta drinks it by mistake, dropping dead in the poet's arms.\n\n===Epilogue===\nThe tavern in Nuremberg: Hoffmann, drunk, swears he will never love again, and explains Olympia, Antonia, and Giulietta are three facets of the same person, Stella. They represent, respectively, the young girl's, the musician's, and the courtesan's side of the prima donna. After Hoffmann says he doesn't want to love any more, Nicklausse reveals she is the Muse and reclaims Hoffmann: \"Be reborn a poet! I love you, Hoffmann! Be mine!\" \u2013 \"{{Lang|fr|Rena\u00eetra un po\u00e8te! Je t'aime, Hoffmann! Sois \u00e0 moi!|italic=no}}\" The magic of poetry reaches Hoffmann as he sings \"{{Lang|fr|O Dieu! de quelle ivresse|italic=no}} \u2013 \"O God! of what intoxication\" once more, ending with \"Muse, whom I love, I am yours!\" \u2013 \"{{Lang|fr|Muse que j'aime, je suis \u00e0 toi!|italic=no}}\" At this moment, Stella, tired of waiting for Hoffmann to come to her rendezvous, enters the tavern and finds him drunk. The poet tells her to leave (\"Farewell, I will not follow you, phantom, spectre of the past\" \u2013 \"{{Lang|fr|Adieu, je ne vais pas vous suivre, fant\u00f4me, spectre du pass\u00e9|italic=no}}\"), and Lindorf, waiting in the shadows, comes forth. Nicklausse explains to Stella that Hoffmann does not love her anymore, but Councillor Lindorf is waiting for her. Some students enter the room for more drinking, while Stella and Lindorf leave together.\n\n== Musical numbers ==\nThe aria \"{{Lang|fr|Chanson de Kleinzach|italic=no}}\" (Song of little Zaches) in the prologue is based on the short story \"{{Lang|de|Klein Zaches, genannt Zinnober|italic=no}}\" (\"Little Zaches, called cinnabar\"), 1819. The barcarolle, \"[[Belle nuit, \u00f4 nuit d'amour]]\" in the Venetian act, is the opera's famous number, borrowed by Offenbach from his earlier opera ''[[Die Rheinnixen|Rheinnixen]]'' (French: ''Les f\u00e9es du Rhin'').<ref name=\"WeaverDecca1986\" />\n\n==Editions==\n{{refimprove section|date=January 2019}}\n[[File:ETA-Hoffmann.JPG|thumb|The original [[E. T. A. Hoffmann]] (1776\u20131822)]]\nOffenbach did not live to see his opera performed. He died on 5 October 1880, four months before its premiere, but after completing the piano score and orchestrating the prologue and first act. As a result, different editions of the opera emerged, some bearing little resemblance to the authentic work. The version performed at the opera's premiere was by [[Ernest Guiraud]], after completing Offenbach's scoring and recitatives. Over the decades, new editions continue to appear, although the emphasis, particularly since the 1970s, shifted to authenticity. In this regard, a milestone was the Michael Kaye edition of 1992, but, then, additional authentic music was found, and published in 1999. In 2011, two competing publishing houses \u2013 one French, one German \u2013 released a joint edition reflecting and reconciling the research of recent decades. Here are some of the edition \"variables\" circulating since Offenbach died:\n\n* Addition of extra music not intended by Offenbach for the opera\n:Commonly, directors choose among two numbers in the Giulietta act:\n:\"{{Lang|fr|Scintille, diamant|italic=no}}\", based on a tune from the overture to Offenbach's operetta ''[[Le voyage dans la lune (operetta)|A Journey to the Moon]]'' and included by [[Andr\u00e9 Bloch (composer)|Andr\u00e9 Bloch]] for a Monaco production in 1908.\n:The Sextet (sometimes called Septet, counting the chorus as a character) of unknown origin, but containing elements of the barcarolle.\n* Changes to the sequence of the acts\n:The three acts, telling different stories from the life of Hoffmann, are independent (with the exception of a mention of Olympia in the Antonia act), easily swapped without affecting the story. Offenbach's order was Prologue\u2013Olympia\u2013Antonia\u2013Giulietta\u2013Epilogue, but during the 20th century, the work was usually performed with Giulietta's act preceding Antonia's. Recently, the original order was restored, but the practice is not universal. The general reason for the switch is that the Antonia act is more-accomplished musically.\n* Naming of the acts\n:The designation of the acts is disputed. The German scholar {{Interlanguage link multi|Josef Heinzelmann|de}}, among others, favours numbering the Prologue as Act One, and the Epilogue as Act Five, with Olympia as Act Two, Antonia as Act Three, and Giulietta as Act Four.\n* Changes to the story \n:The opera was sometimes performed (for example, during the premiere at the Op\u00e9ra-Comique) without the entire Giulietta act, although the famous barcarolle from that act was inserted into the Antonia act, and Hoffmann's aria \"Amis! l'Amour tendre et r\u00eaveur\" was inserted into the epilogue. In 1881, before the opera was performed in Vienna, the Giulietta act was restored, but modified so the courtesan does not die at the end by accidental poisoning, but exits in a gondola accompanied by her servant Pitichinaccio.\n* Spoken dialogue vs. recitative\n:Due to its ''op\u00e9ra-comique'' genre, the original score contained much dialogue, sometimes replaced by recitative, and this lengthened the opera so much, some acts were removed (see above).\n* The number of singers performing\n:Offenbach intended the four soprano roles be played by the same singer, for Olympia, Giulietta, and Antonia are three facets of Stella, Hoffmann's unreachable love. Similarly, the four villains (Lindorf, Copp\u00e9lius, Miracle, and Dapertutto) would be performed by the same [[bass-baritone]], because they are all manifestations of evil. While the doubling of the four villains is quite common, most performances of the work use different singers for the loves of Hoffmann because different skills are needed for each role: Olympia requires a skilled-coloratura singer with stratospheric-high notes, Antonia is written for a lyrical voice, and Giulietta is usually performed by a dramatic soprano or a [[mezzo-soprano]]. Any performance with all three roles (four if the role of Stella is counted) performed by a single soprano in a performance is considered one of the largest challenges in the lyric coloratura repertoire. Notable sopranos performing all three roles include [[Karan Armstrong]], [[Vina Bovy]], [[Patrizia Ciofi]], [[Edita Gruberov\u00e1]], [[Fanny Heldy]], [[Catherine Malfitano]], [[Anja Silja]], [[Beverly Sills]], [[Ruth Ann Swenson]], [[Carol Vaness]], [[Faith Esham]], [[Ninon Vallin]] and [[Virginia Zeani]]. All four roles were performed by [[Josephine Barstow]], [[Diana Damrau]], [[Elizabeth Futral]], [[Marlis Petersen]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Biography|url=http://www.marlis-petersen.de/about|website=Marlis Petersen|accessdate=16 August 2016}}</ref> Georgia Jarman,<ref>{{cite web|last=Jarman|first=Georgia|title=English National Opera, Official Website|url=http://www.eno.org/see-whats-on/productions/production-page.php?itemid=1663&tab=video|publisher=ENO|accessdate=31 May 2012}} (Video comment on performing all four heroines)</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Levy|first=Paul|title=In ''Tales of Hoffman'', All's Fair in Love|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970203646004577215191581868650|newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|date=February 17, 2012}}</ref> [[Elena Mo\u0219uc]]<ref>Basilica Opera program 1969</ref> and [[Joan Sutherland]].\n\nA recent version including the authentic music by Offenbach was reconstructed by the French Offenbach scholar [[Jean-Christophe Keck]].

It became a beacon for the park during this time. The ride was dismantled and removed from the park in 2005.\n\n==History==\n[[Image:Great Gasp - Six Flags Over Georgia.jpg|thumb|200px|left|The Great Gasp in operation]]\nWhen it opened in 1976, the ride was a masterpiece of engineering. The Great Gasp was derived from the [[Parachute Jump]] ride at the [[Coney Island]] in New York. Ride engineers from Intamin (also referred to as Ride Trade) developed the ride at their headquarters in [[Switzerland]], and when the management from Six Flags Over Georgia visited, they knew the ride would be a great addition to their park. The ride was constructed for $1.5 million, a huge investment at the time. Similar Parachute Drop rides were also built at [[Texas Chute Out|Six Flags Over Texas]] and [[Six Flags St. Louis|Six Flags Over Mid-America]].\n\nThe Great Gasp opened with 12 chutes; later the ride was modified to include four stations in which the passengers rode in the standing position. Over the years, the stand-up chutes were removed, and as popularity dwindled, the number of chutes in use also fell.\n\nAs the popularity of the ride fell and spare parts became increasingly difficult to obtain, the era of the Great Gasp was doomed to end. On August 14, 2005, Six Flags Over Georgia announced that the Great Gasp would cease operation forever. On the final weekend, riders were given \"Last Gasp\" pins in commemoration of the legendary ride's last days. Within three weeks of \"Last Gasp\", the Great Gasp was dismantled and removed from the park.\n\n==Operational features==\n[[Image:Lastgasp.svg|thumb|120px|right|A \"Last Gasp\" pin]]\n[[Image:Great_Gasp_disassembly.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Pieces of the Great Gasp when the tower was in the midst of disassembly]]\n\nGasp opened with 12 chutes, although as the ride control system was upgraded and popularity decreased, that number was reduced to 8 chutes.\n\nEach seat held two riders, and was equipped with a seat belt and restraint bar. Stationary cables kept each chute stabilized and in the correct position. Another cable actually moved the seat vertically. Inside the tower was one counterweight for each chute.\n\nThe control system could detect empty seats as well as overloaded seats and would prevent cycling them. The control system hardware was located in the small ring housing at the base of the tower. An [[anemometer]] was mounted at the top of the ride, and was tied into the control system as to prevent operation when wind gusted above a preset limit.\n\nA small elevator inside the tower allowed access to the winch and motor housing at the top. The tower also held antennas for in-park radio communications. The Gasp served as a focal point of New Year's Eve celebrations in 1990.

It became a beacon for the park during this time. The ride was dismantled and removed from the park in 2005.\n\n==History==\n[[Image:Great Gasp - Six Flags Over Georgia.jpg|thumb|200px|left|The Great Gasp in operation]]\nWhen it opened in 1976, the ride was a masterpiece of engineering. The Great Gasp was derived from the [[Parachute Jump]] ride at the [[Coney Island]] in New York. Ride engineers from Intamin (also referred to as Ride Trade) developed the ride at their headquarters in [[Switzerland]], and when the management from Six Flags Over Georgia visited, they knew the ride would be a great addition to their park. The ride was constructed for $1.5 million, a huge investment at the time. Similar Parachute Drop rides were also built at [[Texas Chute Out|Six Flags Over Texas]] and [[Six Flags St. Louis|Six Flags Over Mid-America]].\n\nThe Great Gasp opened with 12 chutes; later the ride was modified to include four stations in which the passengers rode in the standing position. Over the years, the stand-up chutes were removed, and as popularity dwindled, the number of chutes in use also fell.\n\nAs the popularity of the ride fell and spare parts became increasingly difficult to obtain, the era of the Great Gasp was doomed to end. On August 14, 2005, Six Flags Over Georgia announced that the Great Gasp would cease operation forever. On the final weekend, riders were given \"Last Gasp\" pins in commemoration of the legendary ride's last days. Within three weeks of \"Last Gasp\", the Great Gasp was dismantled and removed from the park.\n\n==Operational features==\n[[Image:Lastgasp.svg|thumb|120px|right|A \"Last Gasp\" pin]]\n[[Image:Great_Gasp_disassembly.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Pieces of the Great Gasp when the tower was in the midst of disassembly]]\n\nGasp opened with 12 chutes, although as the ride control system was upgraded and popularity decreased, that number was reduced to 8 chutes.\n\nEach seat held two riders, and was equipped with a seat belt and restraint bar. Stationary cables kept each chute stabilized and in the correct position. Another cable actually moved the seat vertically. Inside the tower was one counterweight for each chute.\n\nThe control system could detect empty seats as well as overloaded seats and would prevent cycling them. The control system hardware was located in the small ring housing at the base of the tower. An [[anemometer]] was mounted at the top of the ride, and was tied into the control system as to prevent operation when wind gusted above a preset limit.\n\nA small elevator inside the tower allowed access to the winch and motor housing at the top. The tower also held antennas for in-park radio communications. The Gasp served as a focal point of New Year's Eve celebrations in 1990. A huge \"1991\" sign was mounted, and fireworks were actually launched from the top ring of the Gasp while a \"Peach\" was dropped, much like the one still dropped in [[Atlanta]], during the Holiday in the Park New Year's Eve celebration on December 31, 1990.\n\nIt has been said that pieces of the Great Gasp were sent to [[Six Flags Over Texas]] for spare parts on the [[Texas Chute Out]] ensuring it could stay in operation for the next few years. The Texas Chute Out closed on September 3, 2012, and was demolished by Dallas Demolition on October 10, 2012.<ref>{{cite web|title=Six Flags demolishes Texas Chute Out|url=http://amusementtoday.com/2012/10/six-flags-demolishes-texas-chute-out/|publisher=Amusement Today|location=Arlington, Texas|date=October 10, 2012|accessdate=October 7, 2018}}</ref> It was replaced with the [[Texas Sky Screamer]] which is nearly twice as tall as the Texas Chute Out.\n\n==References==\n<references />\n\n{{Coord missing|Georgia (U.S. state)}}\n\n{{Six Flags Over Georgia rides}}\n\n[[Category:Amusement rides by name]]\n[[Category:Landmarks in Georgia (U.S. state)]]\n[[Category:Six Flags Over Georgia]]\n[[Category:Amusement rides manufactured by Intamin]]\n[[Category:Six Flags attractions]]\n[[Category:Amusement rides introduced in 1976]]\n[[Category:Amusement rides that closed in 2005]]\n[[Category:Towers in Georgia (U.S. state)]]\n", "name_user": "Hmains", "label": "safe", "comment": "category refine, sort sequence", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Gasp"}

For example: John said: \"I saw Mary today\". Quotations in oral speech are also signaled by special [[prosody (linguistics)|prosody]] in addition to quotative markers. In written text, quotations are signaled by quotation marks.<ref name=\"sdq bonami\">{{cite web |last1=Bonami |first1=Olivier |last2=Godard |first2=Dani\u00e8le |title=On the Syntax of Direct Quotation in French | date=2008 | url=https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-00751080/document |website=HAL |accessdate=10 April 2020}}</ref> Quotations are also used to present well-known statement parts that are explicitly attributed by [[citation]] to their original source; such statements are marked with ([[punctuation|punctuated]] with) [[quotation mark]]s.\n\nQuotations are often used as a literary device to represent someone's point of view. They are also widely used in spoken language when an interlocutor wishes to present a proposition that they have come to know via hearsay.\n\n\n==Quotations as a literary device==\nA quotation can also refer to the repeated use of units of any other form of expression, especially parts of artistic works: elements of a [[painting]], scenes from a [[film|movie]] or sections from a [[musical composition]].\n\n===Reasons for using quotations as a literary device===\nQuotations are used for a variety of reasons: to illuminate the meaning or to support the arguments of the work in which it is being quoted, to provide direct information about the work being quoted (whether in order to discuss it, positively or negatively), to pay homage to the original work or [[author]], to make the user of the quotation seem well-read, and/or to comply with copyright law.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.elc.edu/english-grammar-lesson-using-quotes/|title=English Grammar Lesson - Using Quotes! - ELC|date=2016-11-16|work=ELC - English Language Center|access-date=2017-10-24|language=en-US}}</ref> Quotations are also commonly printed as a means of inspiration and to invoke philosophical thoughts from the reader. Pragmatically speaking, quotations can also be used as language games (in the Wittgensteinian sense of the term) to manipulate social order and the structure of society.<ref>Capone, A., & Salmani Nodoushan, M.

The secret life of slurs from the perspective of reported speech. Rivista Italiana di Filosofia del Linguaggio, 9(2), 92-112.</ref>\n\n===Common quotation sources===\nFamous quotations are frequently collected in books that are sometimes called quotation dictionaries or treasuries.  Of these, ''[[Bartlett's Familiar Quotations]]'', ''[[The Oxford Dictionary of Quotations]]'', ''The [[Columbia University Press|Columbia]] Dictionary of Quotations'', ''[[The Yale Book of Quotations]]'' and ''The [[Macmillan Publishers|Macmillan]] Book of Proverbs, Maxims, and Famous Phrases'' are considered among the most reliable and comprehensive sources.  Diaries and calendars often include quotations for entertainment or inspirational purposes, and small, dedicated sections in newspapers and weekly magazines\u2014with recent quotations by leading personalities on current topics\u2014have also become commonplace.\n\n===Misquotations===\n{{further|False attribution}}\n{{See also|List of movie misquotes}}\nMany quotations are routinely incorrect or attributed to the wrong authors, and quotations from obscure or unknown writers are often attributed to far more famous writers. Examples of this are [[Winston Churchill]], to whom many political quotations of uncertain origin are attributed, and [[Oscar Wilde]], to whom anonymous humorous quotations are sometimes attributed.<ref>See ''A Book of Misquotations'', edited by Elizabeth Knowles, Oxford University Press, 2006.</ref>\n\nThe ''Star Trek'' catchphrase \"[[Beam me up, Scotty]]\" did not appear in that form in the original series.

Instead, they convey the approximative meaning of such an utterance along with the way in which that utterance was produced. From a [[sociolinguistics|sociolinguistic]] perspective, a quotation in spoken discourse can therefore also be defined as \u201ca performance whereby speakers re-enact previous behaviour (speech/thought/sound/voice effect and gesture) while assuming the dramatic role of the original source of this reported behaviour\u201d.<ref name=\"buch\">{{cite book |last1=Buchstaller |first1=Isabelle |title=Quotatives: New Trends and Sociolinguistic Implications |date=2014 |publisher=Wiley Blackwell |isbn=9780470657188 |edition=1st}}</ref>\n\nTraditionally, quotations\u2014more specifically known as direct quotations<ref name=\"clark\" />\u2014have been distinguished from indirect quotations. Direct quotations differ from indirect quotations in that they are reported from the perspective of the experiencer, while indirect quotations are reported from the perspective of the reporting speaker (e.g. ''\"He said: 'I am leaving now'\u201d'' versus ''\"He said (that) he was leaving immediately\"''); are free in their syntactic form, while indirect quotations are subject to language-specific structural requirements (e.g. indirect quotations in many [[Indo-European languages]] are required to have the syntactic form of a [[Well-formedness|well-formed]] declarative [[dependent clause|subordinate clause]]); incorporate extralinguistic material and pragmatic markers, while indirect quotations do not. Crucially, direct quotations have a performative aspect (i.e. occur simultaneously with re-enactments of previous behaviours), which indirect quotations lack.<ref name=\"buch\" /><ref name=\"clark\">{{cite journal |last1=Clark |first1=Herbert |last2=Gerrig |first2=Richard |title=Quotations as Demonstrations |journal=Language |date=December 1990 |volume=66 |issue=4 |pages=764\u2013805 |doi=10.2307/414729 |jstor=414729 |url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Quotations-as-Demonstrations.-Clark-Gerrig/54571a1199be1954678338a879189359fab44182 |accessdate=14 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Reasons for using quotations in spoken discourse===\n\nQuotations are employed in spoken discourse for many reasons. They are often used by speakers to depict stories and events that have occurred in the past to other [[Interlocutor (linguistics)|interlocutors]]. The speaker does not necessarily have to have been an original participant in the story or event. Therefore, they can quote something that they did not hear firsthand. Quotations are also used to express thoughts that have never been uttered aloud prior to being quoted. For example, while telling a story, a speaker quotes inner thoughts that they had during a specific situation. Finally, speakers use quotations to propose future dialogue for participants in a situation that may take place in the future. For example, two friends talk about their 10-year high school reunion that will take place in the future and propose what they would say. While future dialogue can be proposed for a situation that will likely happen, it can also be based on a situation that will not actually take place. In the latter usage, the proposed dialogue only exists in the conversational context.<ref name=\"jessie\">{{cite journal |last1=Sams |first1=Jessie |title=Quoting the unspoken: An analysis of quotations in spoken discourse |journal=Journal of Pragmatics |date=November 2010 |volume=42 |issue=11 |pages=3147\u20133160 |doi=10.1016/j.pragma.2010.04.024 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378216610001220 |accessdate=11 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe quoted material is usually not a verbatim replication of an utterance that someone originally said. Instead, quotations in spoken discourse reproduce what a speaker wishes to communicate to their recipients; quotations demonstrate something that someone said, the manner in which that person said it, and the current speaker\u2019s feelings about what was said.<ref name=\"jessie\" /><ref name=\"clark\" /> In this way, quotations are an especially effective storytelling device; the speaker is able to give a voice to the protagonists in their stories themselves, which allows the speaker\u2019s audience to experience the situation in the way that the speaker themselves experienced it.<ref name=\"buch\" />\n\n===Form of quotation===\n\nIn most languages, quotations in spoken discourse are introduced by a verb of saying and a pronoun. For example, a quotation in English can be introduced by ''\u201cShe said\u201d''. In some languages, there is a discourse marker in addition to the verb of saying that functions as verbal quotation marks.<ref name=\"tracy\">{{cite book |authorlink1=Quotatives |editor1-last=Tracy |editor1-first=Karen |title=The international encyclopedia of language and social interaction |date=2015 |publisher=Wiley Blackwell |isbn=9781118611463 |pages=1272-1276}}</ref> For example, Japanese uses the quotative particle (a type of quotative marker) ''to'' along with the conjugated verb of saying ''itta'':\n\nGloss: TOP=Topic Marker DAT=Dative NOM=Nominative COM=complementizer\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| \u3086\u304d || \u306f || \u3042\u306a\u305f\u3000|| \u306b\u306f || \u5f7c\u5973 || \u304c || \u597d\u304d || \u3068 || \u8a00\u3063\u305f \u3002<ref name=\"tracy\"/>\n|-\n| Yuki || wa || anata|| ni wa || kanocho || ga || suki || '''to''' || '''itta''' .\n|-\n| Yuki|| TOP || you || DAT || her || NOM || like || COM || said\n|-\n| colspan=9|\"''Yuki said that you liked her.''\"\n|}\n\nVerbs of saying (also known as quotative verbs) and quotative particles, along with quotative evidentials, are different types of quotative markers, which signal quotations in utterances.<ref name=\"tracy\"/>\n\n====Quotative markers====\nQuotative markers are used to mark a section of an utterance as quoted speech (i.e. a quotation). In oral speech, quotative markers act as quotation marks and often include a verb of saying (e.g. ''say''). A quotative marker appears either before or after the reported speech or thought, depending on the syntax of the language.<ref name=\"tracy\"/> For example, compare English and Japanese:\n\n'''English:'''\n\nIn English, the quotative verb ''say'' occurs before the quotation:<ref name=\"tracy\"/><ref name=\"frederica\"> Frederica Barbieri. ''Quotative Use in American English'', Journal of English Linguistics, Vol. 33/No.3, September 2005.</ref>\n  She '''said''' \u201cWill you answer the phone, will you answer the phone\u201d\n\nIn English, verbs such as ''be like'', ''go'', and ''be all'' are non-standard quotatives that are commonly used in colloquial speech.<ref name=\"tracy\"/> They are observed in the speech of young people not only in American English, but in English spoken in places like Glasgow, Scotland as well.<ref name=\"adfoolen\">{{cite book |authorlink1=New quotative markers in spoken discourse |editor1-last=Ahrenholz |editor1-first=Bernt |editor2-last=Bredel |editor2-first=Ursula |editor3-last=Klein |editor3-first=Wolfgang |editor4-last=Rost-Roth |editor4-first=Martina |editor5-last=Skiba |editor5-first=Romuald |title=Empirische Forschung und Theoriebildung |date=2008 |publisher=Peter Lang |location=Frankfurt am Main |isbn=978-3-631-56930-6 |pages=117-128}}</ref><ref name=\"frederica\"/> Though not semantically considered a verb of saying, they are used as verbs of saying.

Like ''to'' and ''iu'' (say),  ''to'' and ''omou'' occur after the quotation.\n\n\nIn addition to quotative markers, speakers also use prosodic shifts, pauses, pronominal choices, and tense to detect the occurrence and boundaries of quotations in spoken utterances.<ref name=\"tracy\"/>\n\n==== Spanish ====\n===== Quotative Verb =====\n\n===Syntax of quotation===\nDifferent versions of quotative verbs, particles, and evidentials can be used to express the same idea with varying nuances, often to frame how the primary speaker, or the person who is quoting, feels about a quotation. The syntax of quotations varies cross-linguistically. A primary speaker may use the tense and linguistic idiosyncrasies of the speech at the time it was uttered in a quotation, independent from the tense in the main clause in some languages, or use the same tense in both the main clause and quotation in other languages. They will also use [[coreference|coreferenced]] pronouns to the direct quotation's first-person subject in the main clause: She<sub>x</sub> said, \"I<sub>x</sub>...\"; they<sub>y</sub> said \"we<sub>y</sub> ...\" In many languages, the primary speaker may also attempt to quote an utterance in the same language the original speaker used, even if an interlocutor does not understand it; however, it is mainly context-dependent such as when telling stories.  <ref name=\"Evans Canonical\">{{cite book |last1=Evans |first1=Nicholas |title=Canonical Morphology and Syntax |date=2012 |publisher=Oxford University Press |chapter=Some problems in the typology of quotation: a canonical approach}}</ref><ref name=\"Klamer report\">{{cite journal |last1=Klamer |first1=Marian |title=How report verbs become quote markers and complementisers |journal=Lingua |date=2000 |volume=110 |issue=2 |pages=69\u201398 |doi=10.1016/S0024-3841(99)00032-7|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0024384199000327 | accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"DarcyA Review>{{cite journal |last1=D'Arcy |first1=Alexandra |title=Quotation and advances in understanding syntactic systems |journal=Annual Review of Linguistics |volume=1 |issue=1 |page=43-61 |doi=10.1146/annurev-linguist-030514-125220}}</ref>\n\n=====Quotative verbs=====\nQuotative verbs are lexical verbs that indicate the speech, thoughts, or perceptions of the original speaker.<ref name=\"Evans Canonical\"/><ref name=\"Klamer report\"/>\n\nQuotations can be introduced as the complement to a quotative verb or as the head phrase to an adjunct phrase containing a quotative verb in some languages like English and French.<ref name=\"sdq bonami\"/><ref name=\"DarcyA Review/>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! ||Quotation as complement || Quotation as head phrase adjunct <ref name=\"sdq bonami\"/>\n|-\n| English || Marie said, \u201cMy brother has arrived.\u201d || \u201cMy brother has arrived,\" as Marie said.\n|-\n| French || Marie a dit, \u201cMon fr\u00e8re est arriv\u00e9.\u201d || \u201cMon fr\u00e8re est arriv\u00e9,\" comme a dit Marie.\n|}\nEnglish also displays [[verb-second]] (V2) order vestige only in quotation contexts (quotative inversion), requiring the finite verb to appear in the second position of a clause. For example: \"No no no\" ''says'' Harry. <ref name=\"DarcyA Review/>\n\nDirect and indirect quotations are sometimes not distinguishable. Traditionally, English uses an overt complementizer ''that'' after a quotative verb to indicate indirect quotation, but it is also seen to prompt direct quotation in some English varieties like Indian English, Hong Kong English, and Kenyan English.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Hong Kong English || After the movie I just ''said that'' \"Oh Frank I cannot walk.\" <ref name=\"DarcyA Review\"/>\n|-\n| Indian English || Never a husband ''says that'' \"I'll make a cup of tea okay, you sit. I'll make a cup of tea.\"\n|-\n| Kenyan English || So Kabuwe Abuwe ''told'' us ''that'' \"If it is for wedding I am not going to contribute.\"\n|}\n\n=====Quotative particles=====\nQuotative or hearsay particles are grammatical markers equivalent to full lexical verbs with meanings of ''\"say, mention, tell, etc.\"'' In many languages, they are [[grammaticalization|grammaticalized]] to different extremes from their previously lexical form. Common patterns of grammaticalization trajectories include verb to complementizer in many African and Asian languages and verb to [[tense-aspect-mood]] markers primarily in African languages, but also in Australian languages and multiple other [[language family|language families]]. <ref name=\"DarcyA Review/><ref name=\"Matsui and Yamamoto\">{{cite journal |last1=Matsui |first1=Tomoko |last2=Yamamoto |first2=Taeko |title=Developing sensitivity to the sources of information: Early use of the Japanese quotative particles tte and to in mother\u2013child conversation |journal=Journal of Pragmatics |date=2013 |volume=59 |issue= |pages=5\u201325 |doi=10.1016/j.pragma.2013.06.008 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378216613001598|accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nJapanese, for example, uses a sentence-final quotative particle ''tte'' verbally to mean \"I heard (quote)\" with some uncertainty. In sentence-medial position, ''tte'' is sometimes regarded along with ''to'' to be either a quotative particle or complementizer meaning \"I heard (quote)\" with less uncertainty and often more knowledge of the origin of the quote.\n\nGloss: QP=Quotative Particle FP=Final Particle\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| \u660e\u65e5 || \u6674\u308c\u308b || -\u3063\u3066\u3000<ref name=\"Matsui and Yamamoto\" />\n|-\n| Ashita || hareru || ''tte''.\n|-\n| tomorrow || will-be-fine || QP\n|-\n| colspan=7|\"''It will be fine tomorrow, I heard.''\"\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| \u660e\u65e5 || \u6674\u308c\u308b || -\u3063\u3066/\u3068 || \u8a00\u3063\u3066\u305f\u3000||\u3000\u3088\u3000<ref name=\"Matsui and Yamamoto\" />\n|-\n| Ashita || hareru || ''tte''/''to'' || itteta || yo.\n|-\n| tomorrow || will-be-fine || QP || said || FP\n|-\n| colspan=7|\"''(X) said that it would be fine tomorrow.''\"\n|}\n\nVerbs of saying are highly restricted in Australian languages and almost always immediately proceed the complement verb. \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Instead, they convey the approximative meaning of such an utterance along with the way in which that utterance was produced. From a [[sociolinguistics|sociolinguistic]] perspective, a quotation in spoken discourse can therefore also be defined as \u201ca performance whereby speakers re-enact previous behaviour (speech/thought/sound/voice effect and gesture) while assuming the dramatic role of the original source of this reported behaviour\u201d.<ref name=\"buch\">{{cite book |last1=Buchstaller |first1=Isabelle |title=Quotatives: New Trends and Sociolinguistic Implications |date=2014 |publisher=Wiley Blackwell |isbn=9780470657188 |edition=1st}}</ref>\n\nTraditionally, quotations\u2014more specifically known as direct quotations<ref name=\"clark\" />\u2014have been distinguished from indirect quotations. Direct quotations differ from indirect quotations in that they are reported from the perspective of the experiencer, while indirect quotations are reported from the perspective of the reporting speaker (e.g. ''\"He said: 'I am leaving now'\u201d'' versus ''\"He said (that) he was leaving immediately\"''); are free in their syntactic form, while indirect quotations are subject to language-specific structural requirements (e.g. indirect quotations in many [[Indo-European languages]] are required to have the syntactic form of a [[Well-formedness|well-formed]] declarative [[dependent clause|subordinate clause]]); incorporate extralinguistic material and pragmatic markers, while indirect quotations do not. Crucially, direct quotations have a performative aspect (i.e. occur simultaneously with re-enactments of previous behaviours), which indirect quotations lack.<ref name=\"buch\" /><ref name=\"clark\">{{cite journal |last1=Clark |first1=Herbert |last2=Gerrig |first2=Richard |title=Quotations as Demonstrations |journal=Language |date=December 1990 |volume=66 |issue=4 |pages=764\u2013805 |doi=10.2307/414729 |jstor=414729 |url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Quotations-as-Demonstrations.-Clark-Gerrig/54571a1199be1954678338a879189359fab44182 |accessdate=14 April 2020}}</ref>\n\n===Reasons for using quotations in spoken discourse===\n\nQuotations are employed in spoken discourse for many reasons. They are often used by speakers to depict stories and events that have occurred in the past to other [[Interlocutor (linguistics)|interlocutors]]. The speaker does not necessarily have to have been an original participant in the story or event. Therefore, they can quote something that they did not hear firsthand. Quotations are also used to express thoughts that have never been uttered aloud prior to being quoted. For example, while telling a story, a speaker quotes inner thoughts that they had during a specific situation. Finally, speakers use quotations to propose future dialogue for participants in a situation that may take place in the future. For example, two friends talk about their 10-year high school reunion that will take place in the future and propose what they would say. While future dialogue can be proposed for a situation that will likely happen, it can also be based on a situation that will not actually take place. In the latter usage, the proposed dialogue only exists in the conversational context.<ref name=\"jessie\">{{cite journal |last1=Sams |first1=Jessie |title=Quoting the unspoken: An analysis of quotations in spoken discourse |journal=Journal of Pragmatics |date=November 2010 |volume=42 |issue=11 |pages=3147\u20133160 |doi=10.1016/j.pragma.2010.04.024 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378216610001220 |accessdate=11 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nThe quoted material is usually not a verbatim replication of an utterance that someone originally said. Instead, quotations in spoken discourse reproduce what a speaker wishes to communicate to their recipients; quotations demonstrate something that someone said, the manner in which that person said it, and the current speaker\u2019s feelings about what was said.<ref name=\"jessie\" /><ref name=\"clark\" /> In this way, quotations are an especially effective storytelling device; the speaker is able to give a voice to the protagonists in their stories themselves, which allows the speaker\u2019s audience to experience the situation in the way that the speaker themselves experienced it.<ref name=\"buch\" />\n\n===Form of quotation===\n\nIn most languages, quotations in spoken discourse are introduced by a verb of saying and a pronoun. For example, a quotation in English can be introduced by ''\u201cShe said\u201d''. In some languages, there is a discourse marker in addition to the verb of saying that functions as verbal quotation marks.<ref name=\"tracy\">{{cite book |authorlink1=Quotatives |editor1-last=Tracy |editor1-first=Karen |title=The international encyclopedia of language and social interaction |date=2015 |publisher=Wiley Blackwell |isbn=9781118611463 |pages=1272-1276}}</ref> For example, Japanese uses the quotative particle (a type of quotative marker) ''to'' along with the conjugated verb of saying ''itta'':\n\nGloss: TOP=Topic Marker DAT=Dative NOM=Nominative COM=complementizer\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| \u3086\u304d || \u306f || \u3042\u306a\u305f\u3000|| \u306b\u306f || \u5f7c\u5973 || \u304c || \u597d\u304d || \u3068 || \u8a00\u3063\u305f \u3002<ref name=\"tracy\"/>\n|-\n| Yuki || wa || anata|| ni wa || kanocho || ga || suki || '''to''' || '''itta''' .\n|-\n| Yuki|| TOP || you || DAT || her || NOM || like || COM || said\n|-\n| colspan=9|\"''Yuki said that you liked her.''\"\n|}\n\nVerbs of saying (also known as quotative verbs) and quotative particles, along with quotative evidentials, are different types of quotative markers, which signal quotations in utterances.<ref name=\"tracy\"/>\n\n====Quotative markers====\nQuotative markers are used to mark a section of an utterance as quoted speech (i.e. a quotation). In oral speech, quotative markers act as quotation marks and often include a verb of saying (e.g. ''say''). A quotative marker appears either before or after the reported speech or thought, depending on the syntax of the language.<ref name=\"tracy\"/> For example, compare English and Japanese:\n\n'''English:'''\n\nIn English, the quotative verb ''say'' occurs before the quotation:<ref name=\"tracy\"/><ref name=\"frederica\"> Frederica Barbieri. ''Quotative Use in American English'', Journal of English Linguistics, Vol. 33/No.3, September 2005.</ref>\n  She '''said''' \u201cWill you answer the phone, will you answer the phone\u201d\n\nIn English, verbs such as ''be like'', ''go'', and ''be all'' are non-standard quotatives that are commonly used in colloquial speech.<ref name=\"tracy\"/> They are observed in the speech of young people not only in American English, but in English spoken in places like Glasgow, Scotland as well.<ref name=\"adfoolen\">{{cite book |authorlink1=New quotative markers in spoken discourse |editor1-last=Ahrenholz |editor1-first=Bernt |editor2-last=Bredel |editor2-first=Ursula |editor3-last=Klein |editor3-first=Wolfgang |editor4-last=Rost-Roth |editor4-first=Martina |editor5-last=Skiba |editor5-first=Romuald |title=Empirische Forschung und Theoriebildung |date=2008 |publisher=Peter Lang |location=Frankfurt am Main |isbn=978-3-631-56930-6 |pages=117-128}}</ref><ref name=\"frederica\"/> Though not semantically considered a verb of saying, they are used as verbs of saying.

Like ''to'' and ''iu'' (say),  ''to'' and ''omou'' occur after the quotation.\n\n\nIn addition to quotative markers, speakers also use prosodic shifts, pauses, pronominal choices, and tense to detect the occurrence and boundaries of quotations in spoken utterances.<ref name=\"tracy\"/>\n\n==== Spanish ====\n===== Quotative Verb =====\n\n===Syntax of quotation===\nDifferent versions of quotative verbs, particles, and evidentials can be used to express the same idea with varying nuances, often to frame how the primary speaker, or the person who is quoting, feels about a quotation. The syntax of quotations varies cross-linguistically. A primary speaker may use the tense and linguistic idiosyncrasies of the speech at the time it was uttered in a quotation, independent from the tense in the main clause in some languages, or use the same tense in both the main clause and quotation in other languages. They will also use [[coreference|coreferenced]] pronouns to the direct quotation's first-person subject in the main clause: She<sub>x</sub> said, \"I<sub>x</sub>...\"; they<sub>y</sub> said \"we<sub>y</sub> ...\" In many languages, the primary speaker may also attempt to quote an utterance in the same language the original speaker used, even if an interlocutor does not understand it; however, it is mainly context-dependent such as when telling stories.  <ref name=\"Evans Canonical\">{{cite book |last1=Evans |first1=Nicholas |title=Canonical Morphology and Syntax |date=2012 |publisher=Oxford University Press |chapter=Some problems in the typology of quotation: a canonical approach}}</ref><ref name=\"Klamer report\">{{cite journal |last1=Klamer |first1=Marian |title=How report verbs become quote markers and complementisers |journal=Lingua |date=2000 |volume=110 |issue=2 |pages=69\u201398 |doi=10.1016/S0024-3841(99)00032-7|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0024384199000327 | accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"DarcyA Review>{{cite journal |last1=D'Arcy |first1=Alexandra |title=Quotation and advances in understanding syntactic systems |journal=Annual Review of Linguistics |volume=1 |issue=1 |page=43-61 |doi=10.1146/annurev-linguist-030514-125220}}</ref>\n\n=====Quotative verbs=====\nQuotative verbs are lexical verbs that indicate the speech, thoughts, or perceptions of the original speaker.<ref name=\"Evans Canonical\"/><ref name=\"Klamer report\"/>\n\nQuotations can be introduced as the complement to a quotative verb or as the head phrase to an adjunct phrase containing a quotative verb in some languages like English and French.<ref name=\"sdq bonami\"/><ref name=\"DarcyA Review/>\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n! ||Quotation as complement || Quotation as head phrase adjunct <ref name=\"sdq bonami\"/>\n|-\n| English || Marie said, \u201cMy brother has arrived.\u201d || \u201cMy brother has arrived,\" as Marie said.\n|-\n| French || Marie a dit, \u201cMon fr\u00e8re est arriv\u00e9.\u201d || \u201cMon fr\u00e8re est arriv\u00e9,\" comme a dit Marie.\n|}\nEnglish also displays [[verb-second]] (V2) order vestige only in quotation contexts (quotative inversion), requiring the finite verb to appear in the second position of a clause. For example: \"No no no\" ''says'' Harry. <ref name=\"DarcyA Review/>\n\nDirect and indirect quotations are sometimes not distinguishable. Traditionally, English uses an overt complementizer ''that'' after a quotative verb to indicate indirect quotation, but it is also seen to prompt direct quotation in some English varieties like Indian English, Hong Kong English, and Kenyan English.\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| Hong Kong English || After the movie I just ''said that'' \"Oh Frank I cannot walk.\" <ref name=\"DarcyA Review\"/>\n|-\n| Indian English || Never a husband ''says that'' \"I'll make a cup of tea okay, you sit. I'll make a cup of tea.\"\n|-\n| Kenyan English || So Kabuwe Abuwe ''told'' us ''that'' \"If it is for wedding I am not going to contribute.\"\n|}\n\n=====Quotative particles=====\nQuotative or hearsay particles are grammatical markers equivalent to full lexical verbs with meanings of ''\"say, mention, tell, etc.\"'' In many languages, they are [[grammaticalization|grammaticalized]] to different extremes from their previously lexical form. Common patterns of grammaticalization trajectories include verb to complementizer in many African and Asian languages and verb to [[tense-aspect-mood]] markers primarily in African languages, but also in Australian languages and multiple other [[language family|language families]]. <ref name=\"DarcyA Review/><ref name=\"Matsui and Yamamoto\">{{cite journal |last1=Matsui |first1=Tomoko |last2=Yamamoto |first2=Taeko |title=Developing sensitivity to the sources of information: Early use of the Japanese quotative particles tte and to in mother\u2013child conversation |journal=Journal of Pragmatics |date=2013 |volume=59 |issue= |pages=5\u201325 |doi=10.1016/j.pragma.2013.06.008 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0378216613001598|accessdate=13 April 2020}}</ref>\n\nJapanese, for example, uses a sentence-final quotative particle ''tte'' verbally to mean \"I heard (quote)\" with some uncertainty. In sentence-medial position, ''tte'' is sometimes regarded along with ''to'' to be either a quotative particle or complementizer meaning \"I heard (quote)\" with less uncertainty and often more knowledge of the origin of the quote.\n\nGloss: QP=Quotative Particle FP=Final Particle\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| \u660e\u65e5 || \u6674\u308c\u308b || -\u3063\u3066\u3000<ref name=\"Matsui and Yamamoto\" />\n|-\n| Ashita || hareru || ''tte''.\n|-\n| tomorrow || will-be-fine || QP\n|-\n| colspan=7|\"''It will be fine tomorrow, I heard.''\"\n|}\n\n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n| \u660e\u65e5 || \u6674\u308c\u308b || -\u3063\u3066/\u3068 || \u8a00\u3063\u3066\u305f\u3000||\u3000\u3088\u3000<ref name=\"Matsui and Yamamoto\" />\n|-\n| Ashita || hareru || ''tte''/''to'' || itteta || yo.\n|-\n| tomorrow || will-be-fine || QP || said || FP\n|-\n| colspan=7|\"''(X) said that it would be fine tomorrow.''\"\n|}\n\nVerbs of saying are highly restricted in Australian languages and almost always immediately proceed the complement verb. \n{| class=\"wikitable\"\n|-\n!

Other treaties ended the relationships of the United States and the other Central Powers. Included in the 440 articles of the Treaty of Versailles were the demands that Germany officially accept [[Article 231 of the Treaty of Versailles|responsibility for starting the war]] and pay [[World War I reparations|economic reparations]]. The treaty drastically limited the German military machine: German troops were reduced to 100,000 and the country was prevented from possessing major military armaments such as tanks, warships, armored vehicles and submarines.\n\n==Influenza epidemic==\n[[File:Post WWI Conflict Map In New-York Tribune November 9 1919 Page 26.jpg|thumb|alt=Map of Europe with numbered locations|400px|\nThe ''[[New-York Tribune]]'' prints this map on November 9, 1919, of the ongoing armed conflict in Europe in 1919, one year after World War I had ended:{{sfn|New-York Tribune|1919|p=26}}\n{{Ordered list |[[Baltic states#Newly independent countries East of the Baltic Sea|Baltic States War of Independence]]\n| [[White movement|White Army]] of [[Nikolai Yudenich|General Yudenich]]  \n| [[North Russia intervention]]\n| White Army of [[Alexander Kolchak|Kolchak's in Siberia]]\n| [[Anton Denikin|General Denikin's White Army]]  \n| [[Symon Petlura|General Petlura's Ukrainian directorate]] \n| [[Polish\u2013Soviet War]]\n| [[Upper Silesia plebiscite|Silesia]] tension between the Poles and Germans.\n| [[Hungarian\u2013Romanian War|Romanian occupation of Hungary]]\n| [[Gabriele D'Annunzio|Gabriele D'Annunzio's]] seizes Fiume, creates the [[Italian Regency of Carnaro]]\n| In [[Albania during World War I|Albania promiscuous]] fighting is going on \n| [[Turkish War of Independence]]\n}}\n]]\nHistorians continue to argue about the impact the [[1918 flu pandemic]] had on the outcome of the war. It has been posited that the Central Powers may have been exposed to the viral wave before the Allies. The resulting casualties having greater effect, having been incurred during the war, as opposed to the allies who suffered the brunt of the pandemic after the Armistice. When the extent of the epidemic was realized, the respective censorship programs of the Allies and Central Powers limited the public's knowledge regarding the true extent of the disease. Because Spain was neutral, their media was free to report on the Flu, giving the impression that it began there. This misunderstanding led to contemporary reports naming it the \"[[Spanish flu]].\" Investigative work by a British team led by virologist John Oxford of St Bartholomew's Hospital and the Royal London Hospital, identified a major troop staging and hospital camp in \u00c9taples, France as almost certainly being the center of the 1918 flu pandemic. A significant precursor virus was harbored in birds, and mutated to pigs that were kept near the front.<ref>^ Connor, Steve, \"Flu epidemic traced to Great War transit camp\", The Guardian (UK), Saturday, 8 January 2000.

[https://www.jstor.org/stable/20027428 in JSTOR]</ref> Some of them, such as Czechoslovakia and Poland, had substantial ethnic minorities who were sometimes not fully satisfied with the new boundaries that cut them off from fellow ethnics.  For example, Czechoslovakia had [[Germans in Czechoslovakia (1918\u20131938)|Germans]], [[Poles in Czechoslovakia|Poles]], [[Ruthenians and Ukrainians in Czechoslovakia (1918\u20131938)|Ruthenians and Ukrainians]], [[Slovaks in Czechoslovakia (1918\u20131938)|Slovaks]] and [[Hungarians in Slovakia|Hungarians]]. The [[League of Nations]] sponsored various [[Minority Treaties]] in an attempt to deal with the problem, but with the decline of the League in the 1930s, these treaties became increasingly unenforceable. One consequence of the massive redrawing of borders and the political changes in the aftermath of the war was the large number of European refugees. These and the refugees of the [[Russian Civil War]] led to the creation of the [[Nansen passport]].\n\nEthnic minorities made the location of the frontiers generally unstable. Where the frontiers have remained unchanged since 1918, there has often been the expulsion of an ethnic group, such as the [[Sudeten Germans]]. Economic and military cooperation amongst these small states was minimal, ensuring that the defeated powers of Germany and the Soviet Union retained a latent capacity to dominate the region. In the immediate aftermath of the war, defeat drove [[Germany\u2013Soviet Union relations before 1941|cooperation between Germany and the Soviet Union]] but ultimately these two powers would compete to dominate eastern Europe.\n\nTwo million [[Armenians]], native inhabitants of [[Armenian Highlands|Armenian Highland]], were nearly eliminated in Turkey in consequence of [[Armenian Genocide|Genocide of Armenians]] committed by [[Young Turks|Young Turk Government]].\n\n==Political upheavals==\n{{main|International relations (1919\u20131939)}}\n\n===New nations break free===\nGerman and Austrian forces in 1918 defeated the Russian armies, and the new communist government in Moscow signed the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] in March 1918. In that treaty, Russia renounced all claims to [[Estonia]], [[Finland]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], [[Ukraine]], and the territory of [[Congress Poland]], and it was left to Germany and Austria-Hungary \"to determine the future status of these territories in agreement with their population.\" Later on, [[Vladimir Lenin]]'s government also renounced the [[Partitions of Poland|Partition of Poland treaty]], making it possible for Poland to claim its 1772 borders. However, the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk was rendered obsolete when Germany was defeated later in 1918, leaving the status of much of eastern Europe in an uncertain position.\n\n===Revolutions===\n{{Main|Revolutions of 1917\u20131923}}\n[[File:Europe map 1919.jpg|thumb|400px|right|Political divisions of Europe in 1919 after the treaties of [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk|Brest-Litovsk]] and [[Treaty of Versailles|Versailles]] and before the treaties of [[Treaty of Trianon|Trianon]], [[Treaty of Kars|Kars]], [[Treaty of Riga|Riga]] and the creation of the Soviet Union, [[Irish Free State]] and [[Turkish Republic]]]]\n\nA far-left and often explicitly [[Communist]] [[revolutionary wave]] occurred in several European countries in 1917\u20131920, notably in Germany and Hungary. The single most important event precipitated by the privations of World War I was the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution of 1917]].\n\n===Germany===\n{{Main|German Revolution of 1918\u201319|Hyperinflation in the Weimar Republic}}\nIn Germany, there was a socialist revolution which led to the brief establishment of a number of communist political systems in (mainly urban) parts of the country, the abdication of [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Kaiser Wilhelm II]], and the creation of the [[Weimar Republic]].\n\nOn 28 June 1919 the Weimar Republic was forced, under threat of continued Allied advance, to sign the Treaty of Versailles. Germany viewed the one-sided treaty as a humiliation and as [[Article 231 of the Treaty of Versailles|blaming it for the entire war]]. While the intent of the treaty was to assign guilt to Germany to justify financial reparations, the notion of blame took root as a political issue in German society and was never accepted by nationalists, although it was argued by some, such as German historian [[Fritz Fischer]]. The German government disseminated [[propaganda]] to further promote this idea, and funded the [[Centre for the Study of the Causes of the War]] to this end.\n\n132&nbsp;billion gold marks ($31.5&nbsp;billion, 6.6&nbsp;billion pounds) were demanded from Germany in reparations, of which only 50&nbsp;billion had to be paid. In order to finance the purchases of foreign currency required to pay off the reparations, the new German republic printed tremendous amounts of money \u2013 to disastrous effect. [[Hyperinflation]] plagued Germany between 1921 and 1923. In this period the worth of [[fiat money|fiat]] [[German Papiermark|Papiermark]]s with respect to the earlier [[commodity money|commodity]] [[German gold mark|Goldmark]]s was reduced to one trillionth (one million millionth) of its value.<ref>Table IV (page 441) of ''The Economics of Inflation'' by Costantino Bresciani-Turroni, published 1937.<!--File:GermanyHyperChart.jpg--></ref> In December 1922 the Reparations Commission declared Germany in default, and on 11 January 1923 French and Belgian troops [[Occupation of the Ruhr|occupied the Ruhr]] until 1925.\n\nThe treaty required Germany to permanently reduce the size of its army to 100,000 men, and destroy their tanks, air force, and U-boat fleet (her capital ships, moored at [[Scapa Flow]], were [[Scuttling of the German fleet at Scapa Flow|scuttled by their crews]] to prevent them from falling into Allied hands).\n\nGermany saw relatively small amounts of territory transferred to Denmark, Czechoslovakia, and Belgium, a larger amount to France (including the temporary French occupation of the Rhineland) and the greatest portion as part of a reestablished Poland. Germany's overseas colonies were divided between a number of Allied countries, most notably the United Kingdom in Africa, but it was the loss of the territory that composed the newly independent Polish state, including the German city of [[Free City of Danzig|Danzig]] and the separation of East Prussia from the rest of Germany, that caused the greatest outrage. Nazi propaganda would feed on a general German view that the treaty was unfair \u2013 many Germans never accepted the treaty as legitimate, and lent their political support to [[Adolf Hitler]].\n\n===Russian Empire===\n[[File:Russian civil war west.svg|thumb|European theatre of the [[Russian Civil War]] in 1918\u201319]]\n{{See also|Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War}}\nThe Soviet Union benefited from Germany's loss, as one of the first terms of the armistice was the abrogation of the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]]. At the time of the armistice Russia was in the grips of a [[Russian Civil War|civil war]] which left more than seven million people dead and large areas of the country devastated. The nation as a whole suffered socially and economically.\n\n[[Lithuania]], [[Latvia]] and [[Estonia]] gained independence. They were occupied again by the Soviet Union in 1940.\n\n[[Finland]] gained a lasting independence, though she repeatedly had to [[Winter War|fight]] the Soviet Union for her borders.\n\n[[Armenia]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], and [[Azerbaijan]] were established as independent states in the Caucasus region. However, after withdrawal of Russian army in 1917 and during [[Turkish Invasion of Armenia (1920)|1920 Turkish invasion of Armenia]], Turkey captured the Armenian territory around [[Artvin]], [[Kars]], and [[Igdir]], and these territorial losses became permanent.  As consequence of invasions of Turkey and Russian Red Army all three Transcaucasian countries were proclaimed as Soviet Republics in 1920 and over time were absorbed into the Soviet Union.\n\n[[Romania]] gained [[Bessarabia]] from Russia.\n\nThe Russian concession in [[Tianjin]] was occupied by the Chinese in 1920; in 1924 the Soviet Union renounced its claims to the district.\n\n===Austria-Hungary=== <!-- This section is linked from [[Austria-Hungary]] -->\n{{Essay-like|section|date=December 2009}}\n{{Main|Treaty of Trianon|Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)}}\n\nWith the war having turned decisively against the [[Central Powers]], the people of [[Austria-Hungary]] lost faith in their allied countries, and even before the armistice in November, radical [[nationalism]] had already led to several [[Declaration of independence|declarations of independence]] in south-central Europe after November 1918. As the central government had ceased to operate in vast areas, these regions found themselves without a government and many new groups attempted to fill the void. During this same period, the population was facing food shortages and was, for the most part, demoralized by the losses incurred during the war. Various political parties, ranging from ardent nationalists, to social democrats, to communists attempted to set up governments in the names of the different nationalities. In other areas, existing nation states such as [[Romania]] engaged regions that they considered to be theirs. These moves created de facto governments that complicated life for diplomats, idealists, and the Western allies.\n\nThe Western forces were officially supposed to occupy the old Empire, but rarely had enough troops to do so effectively. They had to deal with local authorities who had their own agenda to fulfill. At the peace conference in Paris the diplomats had to reconcile these authorities with the competing demands of the nationalists who had turned to them for help during the war, the strategic or political desires of the Western allies themselves, and other agendas such as a desire to implement the spirit of the Fourteen Points.\n\nFor example, in order to live up to the ideal of self-determination laid out in the Fourteen Points, Germans, whether Austrian or German, should be able to decide their own future and government. However, the French especially were concerned that an expanded Germany would be a huge security risk. Further complicating the situation, delegations such as the Czechs and Slovenians made strong claims on some German-speaking territories.\n\nThe result was treaties that compromised many ideals, offended many allies, and set up an entirely new order in the area. Many people hoped that the new nation states would allow for a new era of prosperity and peace in the region, free from the bitter quarrelling between nationalities that had marked the preceding fifty years. This hope proved far too optimistic. Changes in territorial configuration after World War I included:\n\n* Establishment of the [[German Austria|Republic of German Austria]] and the [[Hungarian Democratic Republic]], disavowing any continuity with the empire and exiling the [[Habsburg]] family in perpetuity.\n* Borders of newly independent Hungary did not include two-thirds of the lands of the former [[Kingdom of Hungary]], including areas where the ethnic Magyars were in a majority. The new republic of Austria maintained control over most of the predominantly German-controlled areas, but lost various other German majority lands in what was the [[Austrian Empire]].\n\n[[File:Dissolution of Austria-Hungary.png|right|thumb|300px|Division of [[Austria-Hungary]] after World War I]]\n\n* [[Bohemia]], [[Moravia]], [[Opava Silesia]] and the western part of the [[Duchy of Cieszyn]], [[Slovakia]] and [[Carpathian Ruthenia]] formed the new [[Czechoslovakia]].\n* [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria|Galicia]], the eastern part of the [[Duchy of Cieszyn]], northern [[Orava (county)|County of Orava]] and northern [[Spisz]] were transferred to [[Republic of Poland|Poland]].\n* the Southern half of the [[County of Tyrol]] and [[Trieste]] were granted to [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]].\n* [[Austro-Hungarian rule in Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia|Croatia-Slavonia]], [[Kingdom of Dalmatia|Dalmatia]], [[Slovenia]], [[Syrmia]] [[Banat, Ba\u010dka and Baranja]] were joined with [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]] to form the [[Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]], later [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]].\n* [[Transylvania]] and [[Bukovina]] became parts of [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]].\n* The Austro-Hungarian [[Concessions in Tianjin#Austro-Hungarian concession|concession]] in [[Tianjin]] was ceded to the Republic of China.\n\nThese changes were recognized in, but not caused by, the Treaty of Versailles. They were subsequently further elaborated in the [[Treaty of Saint-Germain]] and the [[Treaty of Trianon]].\n\nThe 1919 treaties generally included guarantees of minority rights, but there was no enforcement mechanism.  The new states of eastern Europe mostly all had large ethnic minorities. Millions of Germans found themselves in the newly created countries as minorities. More than two million ethnic Hungarians found themselves living outside of Hungary in Slovakia, Romania and Yugoslavia. Many of these national minorities found themselves in hostile situations because the modern governments were intent on defining the national character of the countries, often at the expense of the other nationalities.  The interwar years were hard for religious minorities in the new states built around ethnic nationalism. The [[Jew]]s were especially distrusted because of their minority religion and distinct subculture.  This was a dramatic come-down from the days of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Although [[antisemitism]] had been widespread during Habsburg rule, Jews faced no official discrimination because they were, for the most part, ardent supporters of the multi-national state and the monarchy.<ref>{{cite book|author=Marsha L. Rozenblit|title=Reconstructing a National Identity: The Jews of Habsburg Austria During World War I|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7CVl3obLidUC&pg=PA163 |year=2004|publisher=Oxford UP|page=163|isbn=9780195176308}}</ref>\n\nThe economic disruption of the war and the end of the Austro-Hungarian [[customs union]] created great hardship in many areas. Although many states were set up as democracies after the war, one by one, with the exception of Czechoslovakia, they reverted to some form of authoritarian rule. Many quarreled amongst themselves but were too weak to compete effectively. Later, when Germany rearmed, the nation states of south-central Europe were unable to resist its attacks, and fell under German domination to a much greater extent than had ever existed in Austria-Hungary.\n\n===Ottoman Empire===<!-- This section is linked from [[Ottoman Empire]] -->\n{{Main|Partitioning of the Ottoman Empire|Turkish War of Independence}}\n[[File:Treaty of S\u00e8vres 1920.svg|thumb|260px|Borders of Turkey according to the [[Treaty of S\u00e8vres]] (1920) which was annulled and replaced by the [[Treaty of Lausanne]] in 1923]]\nAt the end of the war, the Allies [[Occupation of Constantinople|occupied Constantinople]] ([[\u0130stanbul]]) and the Ottoman government collapsed. The [[Treaty of S\u00e8vres]], designed to repair damage caused by Ottomans during the war to the winning Allies, was signed by Ottoman Empire on 10 August 1920, but was never ratified by the Sultan.\n\nThe [[occupation of Smyrna]] by Greece on 18 May 1919 triggered a nationalist movement to rescind the terms of the treaty. [[Turkish National Movement|Turkish revolutionaries]] led by [[Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk]], a successful Ottoman commander, rejected the terms enforced at S\u00e8vres and under the guise of General Inspector of the Ottoman Army, left Istanbul for [[Samsun]] to organize the remaining Ottoman forces to resist the terms of the treaty. On the eastern front, after the [[Turkish\u2013Armenian War|invasion of Armenia in 1920]] and signing of the [[Treaty of Kars]] with the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russian S.F.S.R.]] Turkey took over territory lost to Armenia and post-Imperial Russia.<ref name=\"kars=text\">{{in lang|ru}} [http://www.amsi.ge/istoria/sab/yarsi.html Text of the Treaty of Kars] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070424044332/http://www.amsi.ge/istoria/sab/yarsi.html |date=2007-04-24 }}</ref>\n\nOn the western front, the growing strength of the Turkish nationalist forces led Greece, with the backing of Britain, to invade deep into [[Anatolia]] in an attempt to deal a blow to the revolutionaries. At the [[Battle of Dumlup\u0131nar]], the Greek army was defeated and forced into retreat, leading to the burning of Smyrna and the withdrawal of Greece from Asia Minor. With the nationalists empowered, the army marched on to reclaim Istanbul, resulting in the [[Chanak Crisis]] in which the British Prime Minister, [[David Lloyd George]], was forced to resign. After Turkish resistance gained control over Anatolia and Istanbul, the S\u00e8vres treaty was superseded by the [[Treaty of Lausanne (1923)]] which formally ended all hostilities and led to the creation of the modern [[Turkey|Turkish Republic]]. As a result, Turkey became the only power of World War I to overturn the terms of its defeat, and negotiate with the Allies as an equal.<ref>[http://countrystudies.us/turkey/13.htm Countrystudies \u2013 Turkey]</ref>\n\nLausanne Treaty formally acknowledged the new League of Nations mandates in the Middle East, the cession of their territories on the Arabian Peninsula, and British sovereignty over [[Cyprus]]. The League of Nations granted ''Class A'' mandates for the [[French Mandate of Syria and Lebanon]] and [[British Mandate of Mesopotamia]] and [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]], the latter comprising two autonomous regions: [[Mandate Palestine]] and the [[Emirate of Transjordan]]. Parts of the Ottoman Empire on the [[Arabian Peninsula]] became part of what is today [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[Yemen]]. The [[dissolution of the Ottoman Empire]] became a pivotal milestone in the creation of the modern Middle East, the result of which bore witness to the creation of new conflicts and hostilities in the region.<ref>{{cite book |last=Fromkin |first=David |authorlink=David Fromkin |year=1989 |title=A Peace to End All Peace: Creating the Modern Middle East 1914\u20131922 |location=New York |publisher=H.

Battles such as [[Gallipoli Campaign|Gallipoli]] for Australia and New Zealand, and [[Battle of Vimy Ridge|Vimy Ridge]] for Canada led to increased national pride and a greater reluctance to remain subordinate to Britain, leading to the growth of diplomatic autonomy in the 1920s. These battles were often decorated in propaganda in these nations as symbolic of their power during the war.  Colonies such as the [[British Raj]] (India) and [[Nigeria]] also became increasingly assertive because of their participation in the war. The populations in these countries became increasingly aware of their own power and Britain's fragility.\n[[File:The Girl He Left Behind Him.jpg|alt=|thumb|Cartoon predicting the aftermath of the war by Henry J. Glintenkamp, first published in ''[[The Masses]]'' in 1914]]\n\nIn [[Ireland]], the [[Government of Ireland Act 1914|delay]] in finding a resolution to the [[home rule#Ireland|Home Rule issue]], exacerbated by the Government's [[Easter Rising#Aftermath|severe response]] to the 1916 [[Easter Rising]] and its failed attempt to introduce [[Conscription Crisis of 1918|conscription in Ireland in 1918]], led to an increased support for separatist radicals. This led indirectly to the outbreak of the [[Irish War of Independence]] in 1919. The creation of the [[Irish Free State]] that followed this conflict in effect represented a territorial loss for the UK that was all but equal to the loss sustained by Germany, (and furthermore, compared to Germany, a much greater loss in terms of its ratio to the country's prewar territory). Despite this, the Irish Free State remained a [[dominion]] within the [[British Empire]].\n\nAfter World War I, [[Women's suffrage in the United Kingdom#First World War|women over 30 gained the right to vote]] since, during the war, they had had to occupy what were previously categorized as \"men's jobs\", thus showing the government that women were not as weak and incompetent as they thought.\n\n===United States===\n\nWhile disillusioned by the war, it having not achieved the high ideals promised by President [[Woodrow Wilson]], American [[International Chamber of Commerce|commercial interests]] did finance Europe's rebuilding and reparation efforts in Germany, at least until the onset of the [[Great Depression]]. American opinion on the propriety of providing aid to Germans and Austrians was split, as evidenced by an exchange of correspondence between [[Edgar Gott]], an executive with [[Boeing|The Boeing Company]] and Charles Osner, chairman of the Committee for the Relief of Destitute Women and Children in Germany and Austria. Gott argued that relief should first go to citizens of countries that had suffered at the hands of the [[Central Powers]], while Osner made an appeal for a more universal application of humanitarian ideals.<ref>Kuhlman, Erika A., [https://books.google.com/books?id=t7139hAmM6AC&pg=PA120&dq=edgar+gott&hl=en&sa=X&ei=pppwUYHlAsqNqgG2sIFI&sqi=2&ved=0CDkQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=edgar%20gott&f=false Of Little Comfort]. 2012. pp.&nbsp;120\u2013121.</ref> The American economic influence allowed the Great Depression to start a domino effect, pulling Europe in as well.\n\n===France===\n[[File:French enter Essen.jpg|thumb|French cavalry entering [[Essen]] during the occupation of the Ruhr.]]\n[[Alsace-Lorraine]] returned to France, the region which had been ceded to Prussia in 1871 after the [[Franco-Prussian War]]. At the 1919 Peace Conference, Prime Minister [[Georges Clemenceau]]'s aim was to ensure that Germany would not seek revenge in the following years. To this purpose, the chief commander of the Allied forces, Marshal [[Ferdinand Foch]], had demanded that for the future protection of France the [[Rhine]] river should now form the border between France and Germany. Based on history, he was convinced that Germany would again become a threat, and, on hearing the terms of the Treaty of Versailles that had left Germany substantially intact, he observed that \"This is not Peace. It is an Armistice for twenty years.\"\n\nThe destruction brought upon French territory was to be indemnified by the [[World War I reparations|reparations]] negotiated at Versailles. This financial imperative dominated France's foreign policy throughout the 1920s, leading to the 1923 [[Occupation of the Ruhr]] in order to force Germany to pay. However, Germany was unable to pay, and obtained support from the United States. Thus, the [[Dawes Plan]] was negotiated after Prime Minister [[Raymond Poincar\u00e9]]'s occupation of the Ruhr, and then the [[Young Plan]] in 1929.\n\nAlso extremely important in the War was the participation of [[French colonial troops]] (who amounted for around 10% of the total number of troops deployed by France across the war), including the Senegalese ''[[tirailleur]]s'', and troops from [[French Indochina|Indochina]], North Africa, and [[Madagascar]]. When these soldiers returned to their homelands and continued to be treated as second class citizens, many became the nuclei of pro-independence groups.\n\nFurthermore, under the state of war declared during the hostilities, the French economy had been somewhat centralized in order to be able to shift into a \"[[war economy]]\", leading to a first breach with [[classical liberalism]].\n\nFinally, the socialists' support of the National Union government (including [[Alexandre Millerand]]'s nomination as Minister of War) marked a shift towards the [[French Section of the Workers' International]]'s (SFIO) turn towards social democracy and participation in \"bourgeois governments\", although [[L\u00e9on Blum]] maintained a socialist rhetoric.\n\n===Italy===\n[[File:Fiume cheering D'Annunzio.jpg|thumb|right|Residents of [[Fiume]] cheering D'Annunzio and his ''Legionari'', September 1919. At the time, Fiume had 22,488 (62% of the population) Italians in a total population of 35,839 inhabitants.]]\n\t\nIn 1882 [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]] joined with the [[German Empire]] and the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]] to form the [[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance]]. However, even if relations with [[Berlin]] became very friendly, the alliance with [[Vienna]] remained purely formal, as the Italians were keen to acquire [[Trentino]] and [[Trieste]], parts of the Austro-Hungarian empire populated by Italians.\n\nDuring [[World War I]] Italy aligned with the Allies, instead of joining Germany and Austria. This could happen since the alliance formally had merely defensive prerogatives, while the Central Empires were the ones who started the offensive. With the [[Treaty of London (1915)|Treaty of London]], Britain secretly offered Italy [[Trentino]] and [[County of Tyrol|Tyrol]] as far as [[Brenner, South Tyrol|Brenner]], [[Trieste]] and [[Istria]], all the [[Dalmatia]]n coast except [[Fiume]], full ownership of Albanian [[Vlor\u00eb|Valona]] and a protectorate over [[Italian protectorate over Albania|Albania]], [[Antalya]] in [[Turkey]] and a share of the [[Partitioning of the Ottoman Empire|Turkish]] and [[German colonial empire#Confiscation|German colonial empire]], in exchange for Italy siding against the Central Empires{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}.\n \nAfter the victory, [[Vittorio Orlando]], Italy's [[President of the Council of Ministers of Italy|President of the Council of Ministers]], and [[Sidney Sonnino]], its [[Foreign Minister of Italy|Foreign Minister]], were sent as the Italian representatives to [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris]] with the aim of gaining the promised territories and as much other land as possible. In particular, there was an especially strong opinion about the status of [[Fiume]], which they believed was rightly Italian due to Italian population, in agreement with [[Woodrow Wilson|Wilson]]'s [[Fourteen Points]], the ninth of which read:\n\t\t \t\t\n''\"A readjustment of the frontiers of Italy should be effected along clearly recognizable lines of nationality''\".\n\nNevertheless, by the end of the war the Allies realized they had made contradictory agreements with other Nations, especially regarding [[Central Europe]] and the [[Middle-East]]. In the meetings of the \"Big Four\", in which Orlando's powers of diplomacy were inhibited by his lack of English, the Great powers were only willing to offer [[Trentino]] to the [[Brenner, South Tyrol|Brenner]], the Dalmatian port of [[Zadar|Zara]], the island of [[Lastovo|Lagosta]] and a couple of small German colonies. All other territories were promised to other nations and the great powers were worried about Italy's imperial ambitions; Wilson, in particular, was a staunch supporter of Yugoslav rights on Dalmatia against Italy and despite the Treaty of London which he did not recognize.<ref>But perhaps the major hindrance to Italy's aims were the different opinions of Orlando and Sonnino: the first was decided to obtain Fiume and forsake Dalmatia, Sonnino did not mean to abandon Dalmatia and would have willingly left Fiume. This indecision proved fatal for Italy, which did not gain either of the territories.</ref> As a result of this, Orlando left the conference in a rage. This simply favored Britain and France, which divided among themselves the former Ottoman and German territories in Africa.<ref>(Jackson, 1938)</ref>\n\nIn Italy, the discontent was relevant: [[irredentists|Irredentism]] (see: ''[[Italian irredentism|irredentismo]]'') claimed Fiume and Dalmatia as Italian lands; many felt the Country had taken part in a meaningless war without getting any serious benefits. This idea of a \"mutilated victory\" (''[[Mutilated victory|vittoria mutilata]]'') was the reason which led to the ''[[Italian Regency of Carnaro#Impresa di Fiume|Impresa di Fiume]]'' (\"''Fiume Exploit''\"). On September 12, 1919, the nationalist poet [[Gabriele d'Annunzio]] led around 2,600 troops from the [[Royal Italian Army]] (the [[Granatieri di Sardegna Mechanized Brigade|Granatieri di Sardegna]]), nationalists and irredentists, into a seizure of the city, forcing the withdrawal of the inter-Allied (American, British and French) occupying forces.\n \t\nThe \"mutilated victory\" (''[[Mutilated victory|vittoria mutilata]]'') became an important part of [[Italian Fascism]] propaganda.\n\n===China===\nThe [[Republic of China (1912-49)|Republic of China]] had been one of the Allies; during the war, it had sent [[Chinese Labour Corps|thousands of labourers]] to France. At the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference in 1919]], the Chinese delegation called for an end to Western imperialistic institutions in China, but was rebuffed. China requested at least the formal restoration of its territory of [[Jiaozhou Bay]], under German colonial control since 1898. But the western Allies rejected China's request, instead granting transfer to Japan of all of Germany's pre-war territory and rights in China. Subsequently, China did not sign the Treaty of Versailles, instead signing a separate peace treaty with Germany in 1921.\n\nThe Austro-Hungarian and German [[concessions in Tianjin]] were placed under the administration of the Chinese government; in 1920 they occupied the Russian area as well.\n\nThe western Allies' substantial accession to Japan's territorial ambitions at China's expense led to the [[May Fourth Movement]] in China, a social and political movement that had profound influence over subsequent Chinese history. The May Fourth Movement is often cited as the birth of [[Chinese nationalism]], and both the [[Kuomintang]] and [[Chinese Communist Party]] consider the Movement to be an important period in their own histories.\n\n===Japan===\nBecause of the treaty that Japan had signed with Great Britain in 1902, Japan was one of the Allies during the war. With British assistance, Japanese forces attacked Germany's territories in Shandong province in China, including the East Asian coaling base of the Imperial German navy. The German forces were defeated and surrendered to Japan in November 1914. The Japanese navy also succeeded in seizing several of Germany's island possessions in the Western Pacific: the [[Marianas]], [[Caroline Islands|Carolines]], and [[Marshall Islands]].\n\nAt the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference in 1919]], Japan was granted all of Germany's pre-war rights in [[Shandong]] province in China (despite China also being one of the Allies during the war): outright possession of the territory of [[Jiaozhou Bay]], and favorable commercial rights throughout the rest of the province, as well as a Mandate over the German Pacific island possessions that the Japanese navy had taken. Also, Japan was granted a permanent seat on the Council of the League of Nations. Nevertheless, the Western powers refused Japan's request for the inclusion of a [[Racial Equality Proposal, 1919|\"racial equality\" clause]] as part of the Treaty of Versailles. Shandong reverted to Chinese control in 1922 after mediation by the United States during the [[Washington Naval Conference]]. [[Weihai]] followed in 1930.<ref>Stephen G.

The optimism of [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|1900]] was entirely gone and those who fought became what is known as \"the [[Lost Generation]]\" because they never fully recovered from their suffering. For the next few years, much of Europe mourned privately and publicly; memorials were erected in thousands of villages and towns.\n\nSo many British men of marriageable age died or were injured that the students of one girls' school were warned that only 10% would marry.{{r|cable200709015}}{{r|nicholson2008}}{{rp|20,245}} The 1921 [[United Kingdom Census]] found 19,803,022 women and 18,082,220 men in England and Wales, a difference of 1.72&nbsp;million which newspapers called the \"Surplus Two Million\".<ref name=\"nicholson2008\">{{cite book | title=Singled Out: How Two Million British Women Survived Without Men After the First World War | publisher=Oxford University Press | author=Nicholson, Virginia | year=2008 | isbn=978-0-19-537822-1}}</ref>{{rp|22\u201323}} In the 1921 census there were 1,209 single women aged 25 to 29 for every 1,000 men.

Poison gas and the aerial bombing of civilians were new developments of the First World War. The British civilian population, for many centuries, had not had any serious reason to fear invasion. So the new threat of poison gas dropped from enemy bombers excited a grossly exaggerated view of the civilian deaths that would occur on the outbreak of any future war. Baldwin expressed this in his statement that \"[[The bomber will always get through]].\" The traditional British policy of a balance of power in Europe no longer safeguarded the British home population. Out of this fear came appeasement. It is notable that neither Baldwin nor [[Neville Chamberlain]] fought in the war, but the anti-appeasers [[Antony Eden]], [[Harold Macmillan]] and [[Winston Churchill]] did.\n\nOne gruesome reminder of the sacrifices of the generation was the fact that this was one of the first times in international conflict whereby more men died in battle than from disease, which was the main cause of deaths in most previous wars. The [[Russo-Japanese War]] was another conflict where battle deaths outnumbered disease deaths, but it was fought on a much smaller scale between just two nations.\n\nThis social trauma made itself manifest in many different ways. Some people were revolted by [[nationalism]] and what they believed it had caused, so they began to work toward a more [[internationalism (politics)|internationalist]] world through organizations such as the League of Nations. [[Pacifism]] became increasingly popular. Others had the opposite reaction, feeling that only military strength could be relied upon for protection in a chaotic and inhumane world that did not respect hypothetical notions of civilization. Certainly a sense of disillusionment and [[Cynicism (contemporary)|cynicism]] became pronounced. [[Nihilism]] grew in popularity. Many people believed that the war heralded the end of the world as they had known it, including the collapse of [[capitalism]] and [[imperialism]]. [[Communist]] and [[socialist]] movements around the world drew strength from this theory, enjoying a level of popularity they had never known before. These feelings were most pronounced in areas directly or particularly harshly affected by the war, such as central Europe, Russia and France.\n\nArtists such as [[Otto Dix]], [[George Grosz]], [[Ernst Barlach]], and [[K\u00e4the Kollwitz]] represented their experiences, or those of their society, in blunt paintings and sculpture. Similarly, authors such as [[Erich Maria Remarque]] wrote grim novels detailing their experiences. These works had a strong impact on society, causing a great deal of controversy and highlighting conflicting interpretations of the war. In Germany, nationalists including the [[Nazism|Nazis]] believed that much of this work was [[Degenerate art|degenerate]] and undermined the cohesion of society as well as dishonoring the dead.\n[[Image:World-war-one-belgium-iron-harvest-fieldside.redvers.jpg|left|thumb|[[Iron harvest]] World War I ordnance left beside a field for disposal by the army in 2004 near [[Ypres]] in Belgium]]\n\n==Remains of ammunition==\n{{Main|Iron harvest}}\n\nThroughout the areas where trenches and fighting lines were located, such as the [[Champagne, France|Champagne]] region of France, quantities of [[unexploded ordnance]] have remained, some of which remains dangerous, continuing to cause injuries and occasional fatalities in the 21st century. Some are found by farmers ploughing their fields and have been called the [[iron harvest]]. Some of this ammunition contains [[chemical warfare|toxic]] chemical products such as [[mustard gas]]. Cleanup of major battlefields is a continuing task with no end in sight for decades to come. Squads remove, defuse or destroy hundreds of tons of unexploded ammunition from both World Wars every year in Belgium, France, and Germany.\n\n==Memorials==\n[[Image:Menin-gate-ypres-belgium.redvers.jpg|right|thumb|The [[Menin Gate Memorial]], in [[Ypres]], Belgium]]\n\n===War memorials===\n[[File:Noms 14-18 Draguignan.jpg|thumb|250px|World War I memorial in [[Draguignan]] France]]\nMany towns in the participating countries have [[war memorial]]s dedicated to local residents who lost their lives.

Four empires collapsed due to the war, old countries were abolished, new ones were formed, boundaries were redrawn, international organizations were established, and many new and old ideologies took a firm hold in people's minds. [[World War I]] also had the effect of bringing political transformation to most of the principal parties involved in the conflict, transforming them into [[Electoral democracy|electoral democracies]] by bringing near-[[universal suffrage]] for the first time in history, as in Germany ([[1919 German federal election]]), Great Britain ([[1918 United Kingdom general election]]), and Turkey ([[1923 Turkish general election]]).\n\n==Blockade of Germany==\n\n{{Main|Blockade of Germany}}\nThrough the period from the armistice on 11 November 1918 until the signing of the peace treaty with Germany on 28 June 1919, the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]] maintained the naval blockade of Germany that had begun during the war. As Germany was dependent on imports, it is estimated that 523,000 civilians had lost their lives.<ref>[http://www.dhm.de/lemo/html/wk1/wirtschaft/versorgung/index.html 'german casualties']{{Dead link|date=January 2020}}</ref> N.

The German government was required to use its gold reserves, being unable to secure a loan from the United States.{{citation needed|date=May 2012}}\n\nHistorian Sally Marks claims that while \"Allied warships remained in place against a possible resumption of hostilities, the Allies offered food and medicine after the armistice, but Germany refused to allow its ships to carry supplies\". Further, Marks states that despite the problems facing the Allies, from the German government, \"Allied food shipments arrived in Allied ships before the charge made at Versailles\".<ref>{{cite book |last=Marks |first=Sally |chapter=1918 and After: The Postwar Era |title=The Origins of the Second World War Reconsidered |editor-last=Martel |editor-first=Gordon |location=Boston |publisher=Allen & Unwin |year=1986 |page=[https://archive.org/details/originsofsecondw00gord/page/19 19] |isbn=0-04-940084-3 |chapter-url-access=registration |chapter-url=https://archive.org/details/originsofsecondw00gord |url=https://archive.org/details/originsofsecondw00gord/page/19 }}</ref> This position is also supported by Elisabeth Gl\u00e4ser who notes that an Allied task force, to help feed the German population, was established in early 1919 and that by May 1919 \" Germany [had] became the chief recipient of American and Allied food shipments\". Gl\u00e4ser further claims that during the early months of 1919, while the main relief effort was being planned, France provided food shipments to Bavaria and the Rhineland. She further claims that the German government delayed the relief effort by refusing to surrender their merchant fleet to the Allies. Finally, she concludes that \"the very success of the relief effort had in effect deprived the [Allies] of a credible threat to induce Germany to sign the Treaty of Versailles.<ref>{{cite book |last=Gl\u00e4ser |title=The Treaty of Versailles: A Reassessment After 75 Years |location=New York |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1998 |pages=388\u2013391 |isbn=0-521-62132-1 }}</ref> However, it is also the case that for eight months following the end of hostilities, the blockade was continually in place, with some estimates that a further 100,000 casualties among German civilians due to starvation were caused, on top of the hundreds of thousands which already had occurred.

Other treaties ended the relationships of the United States and the other Central Powers. Included in the 440 articles of the Treaty of Versailles were the demands that Germany officially accept [[Article 231 of the Treaty of Versailles|responsibility for starting the war]] and pay [[World War I reparations|economic reparations]]. The treaty drastically limited the German military machine: German troops were reduced to 100,000 and the country was prevented from possessing major military armaments such as tanks, warships, armored vehicles and submarines.\n\n==Influenza epidemic==\n[[File:Post WWI Conflict Map In New-York Tribune November 9 1919 Page 26.jpg|thumb|alt=Map of Europe with numbered locations|400px|\nThe ''[[New-York Tribune]]'' prints this map on November 9, 1919, of the ongoing armed conflict in Europe in 1919, one year after World War I had ended:{{sfn|New-York Tribune|1919|p=26}}\n{{Ordered list |[[Baltic states#Newly independent countries East of the Baltic Sea|Baltic States War of Independence]]\n| [[White movement|White Army]] of [[Nikolai Yudenich|General Yudenich]]  \n| [[North Russia intervention]]\n| White Army of [[Alexander Kolchak|Kolchak's in Siberia]]\n| [[Anton Denikin|General Denikin's White Army]]  \n| [[Symon Petlura|General Petlura's Ukrainian directorate]] \n| [[Polish\u2013Soviet War]]\n| [[Upper Silesia plebiscite|Silesia]] tension between the Poles and Germans.\n| [[Hungarian\u2013Romanian War|Romanian occupation of Hungary]]\n| [[Gabriele D'Annunzio|Gabriele D'Annunzio's]] seizes Fiume, creates the [[Italian Regency of Carnaro]]\n| In [[Albania during World War I|Albania promiscuous]] fighting is going on \n| [[Turkish War of Independence]]\n}}\n]]\nHistorians continue to argue about the impact the [[1918 flu pandemic]] had on the outcome of the war. It has been posited that the Central Powers may have been exposed to the viral wave before the Allies. The resulting casualties having greater effect, having been incurred during the war, as opposed to the allies who suffered the brunt of the pandemic after the Armistice. When the extent of the epidemic was realized, the respective censorship programs of the Allies and Central Powers limited the public's knowledge regarding the true extent of the disease. Because Spain was neutral, their media was free to report on the Flu, giving the impression that it began there. This misunderstanding led to contemporary reports naming it the \"[[Spanish flu]].\" Investigative work by a British team led by virologist John Oxford of St Bartholomew's Hospital and the Royal London Hospital, identified a major troop staging and hospital camp in \u00c9taples, France as almost certainly being the center of the 1918 flu pandemic. A significant precursor virus was harbored in birds, and mutated to pigs that were kept near the front.<ref>^ Connor, Steve, \"Flu epidemic traced to Great War transit camp\", The Guardian (UK), Saturday, 8 January 2000.

LOC 2004628224.jpg|thumb|alt=Map| Subject nationalities of the German alliance]]\nThe dissolution of the German, Russian, Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman empires created a number of new countries in eastern Europe and the Middle East.<ref>Mark Mazower, \"Minorities and the League of Nations in interwar Europe.\" ''Daedalus'' 126.2 (1997): 47\u201363. [https://www.jstor.org/stable/20027428 in JSTOR]</ref> Some of them, such as Czechoslovakia and Poland, had substantial ethnic minorities who were sometimes not fully satisfied with the new boundaries that cut them off from fellow ethnics.  For example, Czechoslovakia had [[Germans in Czechoslovakia (1918\u20131938)|Germans]], [[Poles in Czechoslovakia|Poles]], [[Ruthenians and Ukrainians in Czechoslovakia (1918\u20131938)|Ruthenians and Ukrainians]], [[Slovaks in Czechoslovakia (1918\u20131938)|Slovaks]] and [[Hungarians in Slovakia|Hungarians]]. The [[League of Nations]] sponsored various [[Minority Treaties]] in an attempt to deal with the problem, but with the decline of the League in the 1930s, these treaties became increasingly unenforceable. One consequence of the massive redrawing of borders and the political changes in the aftermath of the war was the large number of European refugees. These and the refugees of the [[Russian Civil War]] led to the creation of the [[Nansen passport]].\n\nEthnic minorities made the location of the frontiers generally unstable. Where the frontiers have remained unchanged since 1918, there has often been the expulsion of an ethnic group, such as the [[Sudeten Germans]]. Economic and military cooperation amongst these small states was minimal, ensuring that the defeated powers of Germany and the Soviet Union retained a latent capacity to dominate the region. In the immediate aftermath of the war, defeat drove [[Germany\u2013Soviet Union relations before 1941|cooperation between Germany and the Soviet Union]] but ultimately these two powers would compete to dominate eastern Europe.\n\nTwo million [[Armenians]], native inhabitants of [[Armenian Highlands|Armenian Highland]], were nearly eliminated in Turkey in consequence of [[Armenian Genocide|Genocide of Armenians]] committed by [[Young Turks|Young Turk Government]].\n\n==Political upheavals==\n{{main|International relations (1919\u20131939)}}\n\n===New nations break free===\nGerman and Austrian forces in 1918 defeated the Russian armies, and the new communist government in Moscow signed the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] in March 1918. In that treaty, Russia renounced all claims to [[Estonia]], [[Finland]], [[Latvia]], [[Lithuania]], [[Ukraine]], and the territory of [[Congress Poland]], and it was left to Germany and Austria-Hungary \"to determine the future status of these territories in agreement with their population.\" Later on, [[Vladimir Lenin]]'s government also renounced the [[Partitions of Poland|Partition of Poland treaty]], making it possible for Poland to claim its 1772 borders. However, the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk was rendered obsolete when Germany was defeated later in 1918, leaving the status of much of eastern Europe in an uncertain position.\n\n===Revolutions===\n{{Main|Revolutions of 1917\u20131923}}\n[[File:Europe map 1919.jpg|thumb|400px|right|Political divisions of Europe in 1919 after the treaties of [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk|Brest-Litovsk]] and [[Treaty of Versailles|Versailles]] and before the treaties of [[Treaty of Trianon|Trianon]], [[Treaty of Kars|Kars]], [[Treaty of Riga|Riga]] and the creation of the Soviet Union, [[Irish Free State]] and [[Turkish Republic]]]]\n\nA far-left and often explicitly [[Communist]] [[revolutionary wave]] occurred in several European countries in 1917\u20131920, notably in Germany and Hungary. The single most important event precipitated by the privations of World War I was the [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution of 1917]].\n\n===Germany===\n{{Main|German Revolution of 1918\u201319|Hyperinflation in the Weimar Republic}}\nIn Germany, there was a socialist revolution which led to the brief establishment of a number of communist political systems in (mainly urban) parts of the country, the abdication of [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Kaiser Wilhelm II]], and the creation of the [[Weimar Republic]].\n\nOn 28 June 1919 the Weimar Republic was forced, under threat of continued Allied advance, to sign the Treaty of Versailles. Germany viewed the one-sided treaty as a humiliation and as [[Article 231 of the Treaty of Versailles|blaming it for the entire war]]. While the intent of the treaty was to assign guilt to Germany to justify financial reparations, the notion of blame took root as a political issue in German society and was never accepted by nationalists, although it was argued by some, such as German historian [[Fritz Fischer]]. The German government disseminated [[propaganda]] to further promote this idea, and funded the [[Centre for the Study of the Causes of the War]] to this end.\n\n132&nbsp;billion gold marks ($31.5&nbsp;billion, 6.6&nbsp;billion pounds) were demanded from Germany in reparations, of which only 50&nbsp;billion had to be paid. In order to finance the purchases of foreign currency required to pay off the reparations, the new German republic printed tremendous amounts of money \u2013 to disastrous effect. [[Hyperinflation]] plagued Germany between 1921 and 1923. In this period the worth of [[fiat money|fiat]] [[German Papiermark|Papiermark]]s with respect to the earlier [[commodity money|commodity]] [[German gold mark|Goldmark]]s was reduced to one trillionth (one million millionth) of its value.<ref>Table IV (page 441) of ''The Economics of Inflation'' by Costantino Bresciani-Turroni, published 1937.<!--File:GermanyHyperChart.jpg--></ref> In December 1922 the Reparations Commission declared Germany in default, and on 11 January 1923 French and Belgian troops [[Occupation of the Ruhr|occupied the Ruhr]] until 1925.\n\nThe treaty required Germany to permanently reduce the size of its army to 100,000 men, and destroy their tanks, air force, and U-boat fleet (her capital ships, moored at [[Scapa Flow]], were [[Scuttling of the German fleet at Scapa Flow|scuttled by their crews]] to prevent them from falling into Allied hands).\n\nGermany saw relatively small amounts of territory transferred to Denmark, Czechoslovakia, and Belgium, a larger amount to France (including the temporary French occupation of the Rhineland) and the greatest portion as part of a reestablished Poland. Germany's overseas colonies were divided between a number of Allied countries, most notably the United Kingdom in Africa, but it was the loss of the territory that composed the newly independent Polish state, including the German city of [[Free City of Danzig|Danzig]] and the separation of East Prussia from the rest of Germany, that caused the greatest outrage. Nazi propaganda would feed on a general German view that the treaty was unfair \u2013 many Germans never accepted the treaty as legitimate, and lent their political support to [[Adolf Hitler]].\n\n===Russian Empire===\n[[File:Russian civil war west.svg|thumb|European theatre of the [[Russian Civil War]] in 1918\u201319]]\n{{See also|Allied intervention in the Russian Civil War}}\nThe Soviet Union benefited from Germany's loss, as one of the first terms of the armistice was the abrogation of the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]]. At the time of the armistice Russia was in the grips of a [[Russian Civil War|civil war]] which left more than seven million people dead and large areas of the country devastated. The nation as a whole suffered socially and economically.\n\n[[Lithuania]], [[Latvia]] and [[Estonia]] gained independence. They were occupied again by the Soviet Union in 1940.\n\n[[Finland]] gained a lasting independence, though she repeatedly had to [[Winter War|fight]] the Soviet Union for her borders.\n\n[[Armenia]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], and [[Azerbaijan]] were established as independent states in the Caucasus region. However, after withdrawal of Russian army in 1917 and during [[Turkish Invasion of Armenia (1920)|1920 Turkish invasion of Armenia]], Turkey captured the Armenian territory around [[Artvin]], [[Kars]], and [[Igdir]], and these territorial losses became permanent.  As consequence of invasions of Turkey and Russian Red Army all three Transcaucasian countries were proclaimed as Soviet Republics in 1920 and over time were absorbed into the Soviet Union.\n\n[[Romania]] gained [[Bessarabia]] from Russia.\n\nThe Russian concession in [[Tianjin]] was occupied by the Chinese in 1920; in 1924 the Soviet Union renounced its claims to the district.\n\n===Austria-Hungary=== <!-- This section is linked from [[Austria-Hungary]] -->\n{{Essay-like|section|date=December 2009}}\n{{Main|Treaty of Trianon|Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye (1919)}}\n\nWith the war having turned decisively against the [[Central Powers]], the people of [[Austria-Hungary]] lost faith in their allied countries, and even before the armistice in November, radical [[nationalism]] had already led to several [[Declaration of independence|declarations of independence]] in south-central Europe after November 1918. As the central government had ceased to operate in vast areas, these regions found themselves without a government and many new groups attempted to fill the void. During this same period, the population was facing food shortages and was, for the most part, demoralized by the losses incurred during the war. Various political parties, ranging from ardent nationalists, to social democrats, to communists attempted to set up governments in the names of the different nationalities. In other areas, existing nation states such as [[Romania]] engaged regions that they considered to be theirs. These moves created de facto governments that complicated life for diplomats, idealists, and the Western allies.\n\nThe Western forces were officially supposed to occupy the old Empire, but rarely had enough troops to do so effectively. They had to deal with local authorities who had their own agenda to fulfill. At the peace conference in Paris the diplomats had to reconcile these authorities with the competing demands of the nationalists who had turned to them for help during the war, the strategic or political desires of the Western allies themselves, and other agendas such as a desire to implement the spirit of the Fourteen Points.\n\nFor example, in order to live up to the ideal of self-determination laid out in the Fourteen Points, Germans, whether Austrian or German, should be able to decide their own future and government. However, the French especially were concerned that an expanded Germany would be a huge security risk. Further complicating the situation, delegations such as the Czechs and Slovenians made strong claims on some German-speaking territories.\n\nThe result was treaties that compromised many ideals, offended many allies, and set up an entirely new order in the area. Many people hoped that the new nation states would allow for a new era of prosperity and peace in the region, free from the bitter quarrelling between nationalities that had marked the preceding fifty years. This hope proved far too optimistic. Changes in territorial configuration after World War I included:\n\n* Establishment of the [[German Austria|Republic of German Austria]] and the [[Hungarian Democratic Republic]], disavowing any continuity with the empire and exiling the [[Habsburg]] family in perpetuity.\n* Borders of newly independent Hungary did not include two-thirds of the lands of the former [[Kingdom of Hungary]], including areas where the ethnic Magyars were in a majority. The new republic of Austria maintained control over most of the predominantly German-controlled areas, but lost various other German majority lands in what was the [[Austrian Empire]].\n\n[[File:Dissolution of Austria-Hungary.png|right|thumb|300px|Division of [[Austria-Hungary]] after World War I]]\n\n* [[Bohemia]], [[Moravia]], [[Opava Silesia]] and the western part of the [[Duchy of Cieszyn]], [[Slovakia]] and [[Carpathian Ruthenia]] formed the new [[Czechoslovakia]].\n* [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria|Galicia]], the eastern part of the [[Duchy of Cieszyn]], northern [[Orava (county)|County of Orava]] and northern [[Spisz]] were transferred to [[Republic of Poland|Poland]].\n* the Southern half of the [[County of Tyrol]] and [[Trieste]] were granted to [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]].\n* [[Austro-Hungarian rule in Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia|Croatia-Slavonia]], [[Kingdom of Dalmatia|Dalmatia]], [[Slovenia]], [[Syrmia]] [[Banat, Ba\u010dka and Baranja]] were joined with [[Kingdom of Serbia|Serbia]] to form the [[Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes]], later [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]].\n* [[Transylvania]] and [[Bukovina]] became parts of [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]].\n* The Austro-Hungarian [[Concessions in Tianjin#Austro-Hungarian concession|concession]] in [[Tianjin]] was ceded to the Republic of China.\n\nThese changes were recognized in, but not caused by, the Treaty of Versailles. They were subsequently further elaborated in the [[Treaty of Saint-Germain]] and the [[Treaty of Trianon]].\n\nThe 1919 treaties generally included guarantees of minority rights, but there was no enforcement mechanism.  The new states of eastern Europe mostly all had large ethnic minorities. Millions of Germans found themselves in the newly created countries as minorities. More than two million ethnic Hungarians found themselves living outside of Hungary in Slovakia, Romania and Yugoslavia. Many of these national minorities found themselves in hostile situations because the modern governments were intent on defining the national character of the countries, often at the expense of the other nationalities.  The interwar years were hard for religious minorities in the new states built around ethnic nationalism. The [[Jew]]s were especially distrusted because of their minority religion and distinct subculture.  This was a dramatic come-down from the days of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Although [[antisemitism]] had been widespread during Habsburg rule, Jews faced no official discrimination because they were, for the most part, ardent supporters of the multi-national state and the monarchy.<ref>{{cite book|author=Marsha L. Rozenblit|title=Reconstructing a National Identity: The Jews of Habsburg Austria During World War I|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7CVl3obLidUC&pg=PA163 |year=2004|publisher=Oxford UP|page=163|isbn=9780195176308}}</ref>\n\nThe economic disruption of the war and the end of the Austro-Hungarian [[customs union]] created great hardship in many areas. Although many states were set up as democracies after the war, one by one, with the exception of Czechoslovakia, they reverted to some form of authoritarian rule. Many quarreled amongst themselves but were too weak to compete effectively. Later, when Germany rearmed, the nation states of south-central Europe were unable to resist its attacks, and fell under German domination to a much greater extent than had ever existed in Austria-Hungary.\n\n===Ottoman Empire===<!-- This section is linked from [[Ottoman Empire]] -->\n{{Main|Partitioning of the Ottoman Empire|Turkish War of Independence}}\n[[File:Treaty of S\u00e8vres 1920.svg|thumb|260px|Borders of Turkey according to the [[Treaty of S\u00e8vres]] (1920) which was annulled and replaced by the [[Treaty of Lausanne]] in 1923]]\nAt the end of the war, the Allies [[Occupation of Constantinople|occupied Constantinople]] ([[\u0130stanbul]]) and the Ottoman government collapsed. The [[Treaty of S\u00e8vres]], designed to repair damage caused by Ottomans during the war to the winning Allies, was signed by Ottoman Empire on 10 August 1920, but was never ratified by the Sultan.\n\nThe [[occupation of Smyrna]] by Greece on 18 May 1919 triggered a nationalist movement to rescind the terms of the treaty. [[Turkish National Movement|Turkish revolutionaries]] led by [[Mustafa Kemal Atat\u00fcrk]], a successful Ottoman commander, rejected the terms enforced at S\u00e8vres and under the guise of General Inspector of the Ottoman Army, left Istanbul for [[Samsun]] to organize the remaining Ottoman forces to resist the terms of the treaty. On the eastern front, after the [[Turkish\u2013Armenian War|invasion of Armenia in 1920]] and signing of the [[Treaty of Kars]] with the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russian S.F.S.R.]] Turkey took over territory lost to Armenia and post-Imperial Russia.<ref name=\"kars=text\">{{in lang|ru}} [http://www.amsi.ge/istoria/sab/yarsi.html Text of the Treaty of Kars] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070424044332/http://www.amsi.ge/istoria/sab/yarsi.html |date=2007-04-24 }}</ref>\n\nOn the western front, the growing strength of the Turkish nationalist forces led Greece, with the backing of Britain, to invade deep into [[Anatolia]] in an attempt to deal a blow to the revolutionaries. At the [[Battle of Dumlup\u0131nar]], the Greek army was defeated and forced into retreat, leading to the burning of Smyrna and the withdrawal of Greece from Asia Minor. With the nationalists empowered, the army marched on to reclaim Istanbul, resulting in the [[Chanak Crisis]] in which the British Prime Minister, [[David Lloyd George]], was forced to resign. After Turkish resistance gained control over Anatolia and Istanbul, the S\u00e8vres treaty was superseded by the [[Treaty of Lausanne (1923)]] which formally ended all hostilities and led to the creation of the modern [[Turkey|Turkish Republic]]. As a result, Turkey became the only power of World War I to overturn the terms of its defeat, and negotiate with the Allies as an equal.<ref>[http://countrystudies.us/turkey/13.htm Countrystudies \u2013 Turkey]</ref>\n\nLausanne Treaty formally acknowledged the new League of Nations mandates in the Middle East, the cession of their territories on the Arabian Peninsula, and British sovereignty over [[Cyprus]]. The League of Nations granted ''Class A'' mandates for the [[French Mandate of Syria and Lebanon]] and [[British Mandate of Mesopotamia]] and [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]], the latter comprising two autonomous regions: [[Mandate Palestine]] and the [[Emirate of Transjordan]]. Parts of the Ottoman Empire on the [[Arabian Peninsula]] became part of what is today [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[Yemen]]. The [[dissolution of the Ottoman Empire]] became a pivotal milestone in the creation of the modern Middle East, the result of which bore witness to the creation of new conflicts and hostilities in the region.<ref>{{cite book |last=Fromkin |first=David |authorlink=David Fromkin |year=1989 |title=A Peace to End All Peace: Creating the Modern Middle East 1914\u20131922 |location=New York |publisher=H.

Battles such as [[Gallipoli Campaign|Gallipoli]] for Australia and New Zealand, and [[Battle of Vimy Ridge|Vimy Ridge]] for Canada led to increased national pride and a greater reluctance to remain subordinate to Britain, leading to the growth of diplomatic autonomy in the 1920s. These battles were often decorated in propaganda in these nations as symbolic of their power during the war.  Colonies such as the [[British Raj]] (India) and [[Nigeria]] also became increasingly assertive because of their participation in the war. The populations in these countries became increasingly aware of their own power and Britain's fragility.\n[[File:The Girl He Left Behind Him.jpg|alt=|thumb|Cartoon predicting the aftermath of the war by Henry J. Glintenkamp, first published in ''[[The Masses]]'' in 1914]]\n\nIn [[Ireland]], the [[Government of Ireland Act 1914|delay]] in finding a resolution to the [[home rule#Ireland|Home Rule issue]], exacerbated by the Government's [[Easter Rising#Aftermath|severe response]] to the 1916 [[Easter Rising]] and its failed attempt to introduce [[Conscription Crisis of 1918|conscription in Ireland in 1918]], led to an increased support for separatist radicals. This led indirectly to the outbreak of the [[Irish War of Independence]] in 1919. The creation of the [[Irish Free State]] that followed this conflict in effect represented a territorial loss for the UK that was all but equal to the loss sustained by Germany, (and furthermore, compared to Germany, a much greater loss in terms of its ratio to the country's prewar territory). Despite this, the Irish Free State remained a [[dominion]] within the [[British Empire]].\n\nAfter World War I, [[Women's suffrage in the United Kingdom#First World War|women over 30 gained the right to vote]] since, during the war, they had had to occupy what were previously categorized as \"men's jobs\", thus showing the government that women were not as weak and incompetent as they thought.\n\n===United States===\n\nWhile disillusioned by the war, it having not achieved the high ideals promised by President [[Woodrow Wilson]], American [[International Chamber of Commerce|commercial interests]] did finance Europe's rebuilding and reparation efforts in Germany, at least until the onset of the [[Great Depression]]. American opinion on the propriety of providing aid to Germans and Austrians was split, as evidenced by an exchange of correspondence between [[Edgar Gott]], an executive with [[Boeing|The Boeing Company]] and Charles Osner, chairman of the Committee for the Relief of Destitute Women and Children in Germany and Austria. Gott argued that relief should first go to citizens of countries that had suffered at the hands of the [[Central Powers]], while Osner made an appeal for a more universal application of humanitarian ideals.<ref>Kuhlman, Erika A., [https://books.google.com/books?id=t7139hAmM6AC&pg=PA120&dq=edgar+gott&hl=en&sa=X&ei=pppwUYHlAsqNqgG2sIFI&sqi=2&ved=0CDkQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=edgar%20gott&f=false Of Little Comfort]. 2012. pp.&nbsp;120\u2013121.</ref> The American economic influence allowed the Great Depression to start a domino effect, pulling Europe in as well.\n\n===France===\n[[File:French enter Essen.jpg|thumb|French cavalry entering [[Essen]] during the occupation of the Ruhr.]]\n[[Alsace-Lorraine]] returned to France, the region which had been ceded to Prussia in 1871 after the [[Franco-Prussian War]]. At the 1919 Peace Conference, Prime Minister [[Georges Clemenceau]]'s aim was to ensure that Germany would not seek revenge in the following years. To this purpose, the chief commander of the Allied forces, Marshal [[Ferdinand Foch]], had demanded that for the future protection of France the [[Rhine]] river should now form the border between France and Germany. Based on history, he was convinced that Germany would again become a threat, and, on hearing the terms of the Treaty of Versailles that had left Germany substantially intact, he observed that \"This is not Peace. It is an Armistice for twenty years.\"\n\nThe destruction brought upon French territory was to be indemnified by the [[World War I reparations|reparations]] negotiated at Versailles. This financial imperative dominated France's foreign policy throughout the 1920s, leading to the 1923 [[Occupation of the Ruhr]] in order to force Germany to pay. However, Germany was unable to pay, and obtained support from the United States. Thus, the [[Dawes Plan]] was negotiated after Prime Minister [[Raymond Poincar\u00e9]]'s occupation of the Ruhr, and then the [[Young Plan]] in 1929.\n\nAlso extremely important in the War was the participation of [[French colonial troops]] (who amounted for around 10% of the total number of troops deployed by France across the war), including the Senegalese ''[[tirailleur]]s'', and troops from [[French Indochina|Indochina]], North Africa, and [[Madagascar]]. When these soldiers returned to their homelands and continued to be treated as second class citizens, many became the nuclei of pro-independence groups.\n\nFurthermore, under the state of war declared during the hostilities, the French economy had been somewhat centralized in order to be able to shift into a \"[[war economy]]\", leading to a first breach with [[classical liberalism]].\n\nFinally, the socialists' support of the National Union government (including [[Alexandre Millerand]]'s nomination as Minister of War) marked a shift towards the [[French Section of the Workers' International]]'s (SFIO) turn towards social democracy and participation in \"bourgeois governments\", although [[L\u00e9on Blum]] maintained a socialist rhetoric.\n\n===Italy===\n[[File:Fiume cheering D'Annunzio.jpg|thumb|right|Residents of [[Fiume]] cheering D'Annunzio and his ''Legionari'', September 1919. At the time, Fiume had 22,488 (62% of the population) Italians in a total population of 35,839 inhabitants.]]\n\t\nIn 1882 [[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]] joined with the [[German Empire]] and the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]] to form the [[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance]]. However, even if relations with [[Berlin]] became very friendly, the alliance with [[Vienna]] remained purely formal, as the Italians were keen to acquire [[Trentino]] and [[Trieste]], parts of the Austro-Hungarian empire populated by Italians.\n\nDuring [[World War I]] Italy aligned with the Allies, instead of joining Germany and Austria. This could happen since the alliance formally had merely defensive prerogatives, while the Central Empires were the ones who started the offensive. With the [[Treaty of London (1915)|Treaty of London]], Britain secretly offered Italy [[Trentino]] and [[County of Tyrol|Tyrol]] as far as [[Brenner, South Tyrol|Brenner]], [[Trieste]] and [[Istria]], all the [[Dalmatia]]n coast except [[Fiume]], full ownership of Albanian [[Vlor\u00eb|Valona]] and a protectorate over [[Italian protectorate over Albania|Albania]], [[Antalya]] in [[Turkey]] and a share of the [[Partitioning of the Ottoman Empire|Turkish]] and [[German colonial empire#Confiscation|German colonial empire]], in exchange for Italy siding against the Central Empires{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}.\n \nAfter the victory, [[Vittorio Orlando]], Italy's [[President of the Council of Ministers of Italy|President of the Council of Ministers]], and [[Sidney Sonnino]], its [[Foreign Minister of Italy|Foreign Minister]], were sent as the Italian representatives to [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris]] with the aim of gaining the promised territories and as much other land as possible. In particular, there was an especially strong opinion about the status of [[Fiume]], which they believed was rightly Italian due to Italian population, in agreement with [[Woodrow Wilson|Wilson]]'s [[Fourteen Points]], the ninth of which read:\n\t\t \t\t\n''\"A readjustment of the frontiers of Italy should be effected along clearly recognizable lines of nationality''\".\n\nNevertheless, by the end of the war the Allies realized they had made contradictory agreements with other Nations, especially regarding [[Central Europe]] and the [[Middle-East]]. In the meetings of the \"Big Four\", in which Orlando's powers of diplomacy were inhibited by his lack of English, the Great powers were only willing to offer [[Trentino]] to the [[Brenner, South Tyrol|Brenner]], the Dalmatian port of [[Zadar|Zara]], the island of [[Lastovo|Lagosta]] and a couple of small German colonies. All other territories were promised to other nations and the great powers were worried about Italy's imperial ambitions; Wilson, in particular, was a staunch supporter of Yugoslav rights on Dalmatia against Italy and despite the Treaty of London which he did not recognize.<ref>But perhaps the major hindrance to Italy's aims were the different opinions of Orlando and Sonnino: the first was decided to obtain Fiume and forsake Dalmatia, Sonnino did not mean to abandon Dalmatia and would have willingly left Fiume. This indecision proved fatal for Italy, which did not gain either of the territories.</ref> As a result of this, Orlando left the conference in a rage. This simply favored Britain and France, which divided among themselves the former Ottoman and German territories in Africa.<ref>(Jackson, 1938)</ref>\n\nIn Italy, the discontent was relevant: [[irredentists|Irredentism]] (see: ''[[Italian irredentism|irredentismo]]'') claimed Fiume and Dalmatia as Italian lands; many felt the Country had taken part in a meaningless war without getting any serious benefits. This idea of a \"mutilated victory\" (''[[Mutilated victory|vittoria mutilata]]'') was the reason which led to the ''[[Italian Regency of Carnaro#Impresa di Fiume|Impresa di Fiume]]'' (\"''Fiume Exploit''\"). On September 12, 1919, the nationalist poet [[Gabriele d'Annunzio]] led around 2,600 troops from the [[Royal Italian Army]] (the [[Granatieri di Sardegna Mechanized Brigade|Granatieri di Sardegna]]), nationalists and irredentists, into a seizure of the city, forcing the withdrawal of the inter-Allied (American, British and French) occupying forces.\n \t\nThe \"mutilated victory\" (''[[Mutilated victory|vittoria mutilata]]'') became an important part of [[Italian Fascism]] propaganda.\n\n===China===\nThe [[Republic of China (1912-49)|Republic of China]] had been one of the Allies; during the war, it had sent [[Chinese Labour Corps|thousands of labourers]] to France. At the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference in 1919]], the Chinese delegation called for an end to Western imperialistic institutions in China, but was rebuffed. China requested at least the formal restoration of its territory of [[Jiaozhou Bay]], under German colonial control since 1898. But the western Allies rejected China's request, instead granting transfer to Japan of all of Germany's pre-war territory and rights in China. Subsequently, China did not sign the Treaty of Versailles, instead signing a separate peace treaty with Germany in 1921.\n\nThe Austro-Hungarian and German [[concessions in Tianjin]] were placed under the administration of the Chinese government; in 1920 they occupied the Russian area as well.\n\nThe western Allies' substantial accession to Japan's territorial ambitions at China's expense led to the [[May Fourth Movement]] in China, a social and political movement that had profound influence over subsequent Chinese history. The May Fourth Movement is often cited as the birth of [[Chinese nationalism]], and both the [[Kuomintang]] and [[Chinese Communist Party]] consider the Movement to be an important period in their own histories.\n\n===Japan===\nBecause of the treaty that Japan had signed with Great Britain in 1902, Japan was one of the Allies during the war. With British assistance, Japanese forces attacked Germany's territories in Shandong province in China, including the East Asian coaling base of the Imperial German navy. The German forces were defeated and surrendered to Japan in November 1914. The Japanese navy also succeeded in seizing several of Germany's island possessions in the Western Pacific: the [[Marianas]], [[Caroline Islands|Carolines]], and [[Marshall Islands]].\n\nAt the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|Paris Peace Conference in 1919]], Japan was granted all of Germany's pre-war rights in [[Shandong]] province in China (despite China also being one of the Allies during the war): outright possession of the territory of [[Jiaozhou Bay]], and favorable commercial rights throughout the rest of the province, as well as a Mandate over the German Pacific island possessions that the Japanese navy had taken. Also, Japan was granted a permanent seat on the Council of the League of Nations. Nevertheless, the Western powers refused Japan's request for the inclusion of a [[Racial Equality Proposal, 1919|\"racial equality\" clause]] as part of the Treaty of Versailles. Shandong reverted to Chinese control in 1922 after mediation by the United States during the [[Washington Naval Conference]]. [[Weihai]] followed in 1930.<ref>Stephen G.

The optimism of [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|1900]] was entirely gone and those who fought became what is known as \"the [[Lost Generation]]\" because they never fully recovered from their suffering. For the next few years, much of Europe mourned privately and publicly; memorials were erected in thousands of villages and towns.\n\nSo many British men of marriageable age died or were injured that the students of one girls' school were warned that only 10% would marry.{{r|cable200709015}}{{r|nicholson2008}}{{rp|20,245}} The 1921 [[United Kingdom Census]] found 19,803,022 women and 18,082,220 men in England and Wales, a difference of 1.72&nbsp;million which newspapers called the \"Surplus Two Million\".<ref name=\"nicholson2008\">{{cite book | title=Singled Out: How Two Million British Women Survived Without Men After the First World War | publisher=Oxford University Press | author=Nicholson, Virginia | year=2008 | isbn=978-0-19-537822-1}}</ref>{{rp|22\u201323}} In the 1921 census there were 1,209 single women aged 25 to 29 for every 1,000 men.

Poison gas and the aerial bombing of civilians were new developments of the First World War. The British civilian population, for many centuries, had not had any serious reason to fear invasion. So the new threat of poison gas dropped from enemy bombers excited a grossly exaggerated view of the civilian deaths that would occur on the outbreak of any future war. Baldwin expressed this in his statement that \"[[The bomber will always get through]].\" The traditional British policy of a balance of power in Europe no longer safeguarded the British home population. Out of this fear came appeasement. It is notable that neither Baldwin nor [[Neville Chamberlain]] fought in the war, but the anti-appeasers [[Antony Eden]], [[Harold Macmillan]] and [[Winston Churchill]] did.\n\nOne gruesome reminder of the sacrifices of the generation was the fact that this was one of the first times in international conflict whereby more men died in battle than from disease, which was the main cause of deaths in most previous wars. The [[Russo-Japanese War]] was another conflict where battle deaths outnumbered disease deaths, but it was fought on a much smaller scale between just two nations.\n\nThis social trauma made itself manifest in many different ways. Some people were revolted by [[nationalism]] and what they believed it had caused, so they began to work toward a more [[internationalism (politics)|internationalist]] world through organizations such as the League of Nations. [[Pacifism]] became increasingly popular. Others had the opposite reaction, feeling that only military strength could be relied upon for protection in a chaotic and inhumane world that did not respect hypothetical notions of civilization. Certainly a sense of disillusionment and [[Cynicism (contemporary)|cynicism]] became pronounced. [[Nihilism]] grew in popularity. Many people believed that the war heralded the end of the world as they had known it, including the collapse of [[capitalism]] and [[imperialism]]. [[Communist]] and [[socialist]] movements around the world drew strength from this theory, enjoying a level of popularity they had never known before. These feelings were most pronounced in areas directly or particularly harshly affected by the war, such as central Europe, Russia and France.\n\nArtists such as [[Otto Dix]], [[George Grosz]], [[Ernst Barlach]], and [[K\u00e4the Kollwitz]] represented their experiences, or those of their society, in blunt paintings and sculpture. Similarly, authors such as [[Erich Maria Remarque]] wrote grim novels detailing their experiences. These works had a strong impact on society, causing a great deal of controversy and highlighting conflicting interpretations of the war. In Germany, nationalists including the [[Nazism|Nazis]] believed that much of this work was [[Degenerate art|degenerate]] and undermined the cohesion of society as well as dishonoring the dead.\n[[Image:World-war-one-belgium-iron-harvest-fieldside.redvers.jpg|left|thumb|[[Iron harvest]] World War I ordnance left beside a field for disposal by the army in 2004 near [[Ypres]] in Belgium]]\n\n==Remains of ammunition==\n{{Main|Iron harvest}}\n\nThroughout the areas where trenches and fighting lines were located, such as the [[Champagne, France|Champagne]] region of France, quantities of [[unexploded ordnance]] have remained, some of which remains dangerous, continuing to cause injuries and occasional fatalities in the 21st century. Some are found by farmers ploughing their fields and have been called the [[iron harvest]]. Some of this ammunition contains [[chemical warfare|toxic]] chemical products such as [[mustard gas]]. Cleanup of major battlefields is a continuing task with no end in sight for decades to come. Squads remove, defuse or destroy hundreds of tons of unexploded ammunition from both World Wars every year in Belgium, France, and Germany.\n\n==Memorials==\n[[Image:Menin-gate-ypres-belgium.redvers.jpg|right|thumb|The [[Menin Gate Memorial]], in [[Ypres]], Belgium]]\n\n===War memorials===\n[[File:Noms 14-18 Draguignan.jpg|thumb|250px|World War I memorial in [[Draguignan]] France]]\nMany towns in the participating countries have [[war memorial]]s dedicated to local residents who lost their lives.
