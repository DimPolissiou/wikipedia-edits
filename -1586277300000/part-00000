Thousands of opposition activists were [[Internment|imprisoned]] without charge and as many as 91 killed.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6175517.stm Poland marks communist crackdown], [[BBC News]], 13 December 2006</ref> Although martial law was lifted in 1983, many of the [[political prisoner]]s were not released until a general [[amnesty]] in 1986.\n\nSince the 1970s, communist Poland was struggling economically. The First Secretary and ''de facto'' leader, [[Edward Gierek]], made large incessant loans from western creditors to achieve a better economic output that instead resulted in a domestic crisis. Basic goods and food were being heavily [[Rationing|rationed]] which acted as a stimuli for the establishment of a first anti-communist [[trade union]] in the [[Eastern Bloc]], known as Solidarity, in 1980. Gierek, who permitted the trade union to appear per the [[Gda\u0144sk Agreement]], was dismissed from his post less than a month later under pressure from the USSR and confined to [[house arrest]]. Poland's already somewhat liberal policies concerning the opposition were worrisome for hardliners in the [[Soviet Union]], who feared that the Poles may overthrow communism and ally themselves with the [[Western Bloc]]. The Soviets were particularly uneasy as the departure of Eastern Bloc's most populous nation from [[Comecon]] would trigger further financial and economic problems that would bring an end to communist rule in Central-Eastern Europe. After a series of strikes and demonstrations by employees of chief industrial regions, Poland was directly heading towards bankruptcy. \n\nThe [[Military Council of National Salvation]] was formed by the new First Secretary of the Polish United Workers' Party, General [[Wojciech Jaruzelski]], who was determined to put an end to the demonstrations and crush the opposition by force if necessary. There is speculation whether Jaruzelski instigated martial law to prevent bloodshed if the Soviets and other [[Warsaw Pact]] countries were to enter Poland under the mutual assistance treaty, like in the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]] and the [[invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968]]. On 13 December 1981, Jaruzelski announced the introduction of martial law in a televised speech addressed to the entire nation. The Polish People's Army, [[Citizen's Militia]] (MO), [[ZOMO]] special units and tanks rolled onto the streets to scare off demonstrators, begin regular patrols and maintain [[curfew]]. Intercity travelling was forbidden unless a permit was granted by the authorities. Food rationing intensified and there were shortages of every basic product. The [[S\u0142u\u017cba Bezpiecze\u0144stwa|secret services (SB)]] [[wiretapped]] phones in public booths and state institutions. \n\nOn 16 December, pro-Solidarity miners organized a strike against the declaration of the martial law at the [[Wujek Coal Mine]] in the industrial city of [[Katowice]]. The ZOMO squads, nicknamed \"Communist [[Gestapo]]\" by the opposition, brutally [[Pacification of Wujek|pacified Wujek]], which resulted in the deaths of 9 miners. All other [[1982 demonstrations in Poland|demonstrations across Poland]] were met with armed force of the services, which utilized [[water cannons]], [[tear gas]], [[Baton (law enforcement)|batons]], truncheons and clubs to disperse crowds and beat protesters. Thousands were detained and some were tortured in state prisons. On 31 August 1982, in the copper-mining town of [[Lubin]], 3 people were mortally wounded by ZOMO. Until the end of the martial law on 22 July 1983, approximately 91 people were killed, though this figure varies and is still debated among historians.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6175517.stm Poland marks communist crackdown], [[BBC News]], 13 December 2006</ref>\n\n==Declaration==\nLed by [[General of the Army]] [[Wojciech Jaruzelski]], the [[Military Council of National Salvation]] (''Wojskowa Rada Ocalenia Narodowego'', WRON) usurped for itself powers reserved for wartime, hence the name. The plan was presented to the government of the [[Soviet Union]] before the declaration in March 1981.\n\nAppearing on Polish television at 6:00 a.m. on 13 December 1981, General Jaruzelski said:<ref>The original is available at [http://www.konflikty.pl/a,395,Czasy_najnowsze,Przemowienie_gen._Jaruzelskiego.html Konflikty.pl] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121112060937/http://www.konflikty.pl/a,395,Czasy_najnowsze,Przemowienie_gen._Jaruzelskiego.html |date=2012-11-12 }}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>Today I address myself to you as a soldier and as the head of the Polish government. I address you concerning extraordinarily important questions. Our homeland is at the edge of an abyss. The achievements of many generations and the Polish home that has been built up from the dust are about to turn into ruins. State structures are ceasing to function. Each day delivers new blows to the waning economy./.../<br>The atmosphere of conflicts, misunderstanding, hatred causes moral degradation, surpasses the limits of toleration. Strikes, the readiness to strike, actions of protest have become a norm of life. Even school youth are being drawn into this. Yesterday evening, many public buildings remained seized. The cries are voiced to physical reprisals with the 'reds', with people who have different opinions. <br>The cases of terror, threats and moral vendetta, of even direct violence are on the rise. A wave of impudent crimes, robberies and burglaries is running across the country. The underground business sharks' fortunes, already reaching millions, are growing. Chaos and demoralization have reached the magnitude of a catastrophe. People have reached the limit of psychological toleration. Many people are struck by despair. Not only days, but hours as well are bringing forth the all-national disaster./.../<br>Citizens!<br>The load of responsibility that falls on me on this dramatic moment in the Polish history is huge. It is my duty to take this responsibility - concerning the future of Poland, that my generation fought for on all the fronts of the war and for which they sacrificed the best years of their life. I declare, that today the Military Council of National Salvation has been formed. In accordance with the Constitution, the State Council has imposed martial law all over the country. I wish that everyone understood the motives of our actions. A military coup, military dictatorship is not our goal./.../<br> In longer perspective, none of Poland's problems can be solved with the use of violence. The Military Council of National Salvation does not replace constitutional organs of power. Its only purpose is to keep the legal balance of the country, to create guarantees that give a chance to restore order and discipline. This is the ultimate way to bring the country out of the crisis, to save the country from collapse./.../<br>I appeal to all the citizens. A time of heavy trials has arrived. And we have to stand those in order to prove that we are worthy of Poland.<br>Before all the Polish people and the whole world I would like to repeat the immortal words: <br>\n::'''''[[Poland Is Not Yet Lost|Poland has not yet perished, so long as we still live]]!'''''</blockquote>\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:AGAD_Gen._Wojciech_jaruzelski_13_grudnia_1981.png|Wojciech Jaruzelski in a TV studio to read a speech announcing the introduction of martial law\nFile:Stan wojenny obwieszczenie.jpg|The proclamation of martial law by the State Council\nFile:Stan wojenny w Polsce - 1981-1983 - 12a.JPG|Members of the [[Milicja_Obywatelska|Citizens' Militia]] race to disperse crowds of protesters\n</gallery>\n\n==Martial law==\n[[File:Telegr.jpg|thumb|A censored telegram, 1982]]\n\nGeneral Jaruzelski had ordered the Polish General Staff to update plans for nationwide martial law on 22 October 1980.<ref>''From Solidarity to Martial Law: The Polish Crisis of 1980\u20131981: A Documentary History'' by Andrzej Paczkowski, Malcolm Byrne. Central European University Press, Budapest 2007. p. xxxiii</ref> After the introduction of martial law, pro-[[democracy]] movements such as [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] and other smaller organisations were banned, and their leaders, including [[Lech Wa\u0142\u0119sa]], jailed overnight. In the morning, thousands of soldiers in military vehicles appeared on the streets of every major city. A [[curfew]] was imposed, the national borders sealed, airports closed, and road access to main cities restricted. Telephone lines were disconnected, mail subject to renewed [[postal censorship]], all independent official organizations were criminalized, and classes in schools and universities suspended.\n\nDuring the initial imposition of martial law, several dozen people were killed. Official reports during the crackdown claimed about a dozen fatalities, while a [[Sejm of the Republic of Poland|parliamentary]] commission in the years 1989\u20131991 arrived at a figure of over 90.<ref>[http://wyborcza.pl/1,77062,3787704.html Ofiary stanu wojennego i lat nast\u0119pnych do 1989] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140108144638/http://wyborcza.pl/1,77062,3787704.html |date=2014-01-08 }} by Piotr Lipi\u0144ski</ref> In the deadliest incident, nine coal miners were killed by: \"[[ZOMO]]\" paramilitary police during the [[strike-breaking]] at the [[Pacification of Wujek]] on 16 December 1981. Others were also killed and wounded during a massive second wave of demonstrations on [[August 31, 1982 demonstrations in Poland|31 August 1982]].\n\nThe government imposed a six-day work week while the mass media, public services, healthcare services, power stations, coal mines, sea ports, railway stations, and most key factories were placed under military management, with employees having to follow military orders or face a [[court martial]]. As part of the crackdown, media and educational institutions underwent \"verification\", a process that tested each employee's attitude towards the regime and to the Solidarity movement; as a result, thousands of journalists, teachers and professors were banned from their professions. [[Military court]]s were established to bypass the normal court system, to imprison those spreading \"false information\".<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/special_report/1999/09/99/iron_curtain/timelines/poland_81.stm 1981: Martial law], [[BBC]]</ref> In an attempt to crush resistance, civilian phone lines were routinely tapped and monitored by government agents.\n\nAt the invitation of Jaruzelski, a delegation of the ruling [[Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party]] visited Poland between 27 and 29 December. The Hungarians shared with their Polish colleagues their experiences on crushing the [[1956 Hungarian revolution|\"counterrevolution\" of 1956]]. Earlier in the autumn of 1981, Polish television had broadcast a special film on the 1956 events in Hungary, showing scenes of rebels hanging security officers etc.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=wI9TUaZZeAMC&pg=PA499&dq=jaruzelski+1981+martial+law#v=onepage&q=jaruzelski%201981%20martial%20law&f=false Google Books]</ref>\n\nThe introduction of martial law was enthusiastically supported by some figures on the right like [[J\u0119drzej Giertych]],<ref>Polish Western affairs, Volumes 31\u201332.

It also led to severe economic consequences. The ruling [[military dictatorship]] instituted major price rises (dubbed \"economic reforms\"), which resulted in a fall in real wages of 20% or more. The resulting [[economic crisis]] led to the [[rationing]] of most products and materials, including basic foodstuffs.\n\nAs a consequence of economic hardship and political repression, an exodus of Poles saw 700,000 emigrate to the West between 1981 and 1989.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=nypuJ8BARiMC&pg=PA7&lpg=PA7&dq=poland+economy+1980s&source=bl&ots=iR_fCDeyE6&sig=q2hNTHlJPvd7MOfHIhY-lEKmJsc&hl=en&ei=lLEbS6OKG8z_4Abzt4TnAg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10&ved=0CDIQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&q=poland%20economy%201980s&f=false Google Books]</ref> \nA number of international flights were even hijacked in attempts to flee the country and its economic problems.

However, the Sejm had been in session at the time when martial law was instituted. In 1992 the Sejm declared the 1981 imposition of martial law to be unlawful and unconstitutional.\n\n===Soviet intervention debate===\n{{further|Soviet reaction to the Polish Crisis of 1980-1981}}\n\nThe instigators of the martial law, such as [[Wojciech Jaruzelski]], argue that the army crackdown rescued Poland from a possibly disastrous [[military intervention]] of the [[Soviet Union]], [[East Germany]], and other [[Warsaw Pact]] countries (similar to the earlier interventions in [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956|Hungary in 1956]] and [[Prague Spring|Czechoslovakia in 1968]]).<ref>[http://www.euronews.net/2008/10/02/jaruzelski-says-martial-law-saved-poland/ Jaruzelski says martial law saved Poland], [[Euronews]], 02/10/08</ref> Public figures who supported the introduction of martial law (including some of the right-wing figures like [[J\u0119drzej Giertych]]) would also refer to that threat.\n\nIn 2009, archive documents hinted that in a conversation

period between 13 December 1981 and 22 July 1983, when the [[authoritarian]] [[communist government]] of the [[Polish People's Republic]] drastically restricted normal life by introducing [[martial law]] in an attempt to throttle political opposition, in particular the [[Solidarity Movement]]. Thousands of opposition activists were [[Internment|imprisoned]] without charge and as many as 91 killed.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6175517.stm Poland marks communist crackdown], [[BBC News]], 13 December 2006</ref> Although martial law was lifted in 1983, many of the [[political prisoner]]s were not released until a general [[amnesty]] in 1986.\n\nSince the 1970s, communist Poland was struggling economically. The First Secretary and ''de facto'' leader, [[Edward Gierek]], made large incessant loans from western creditors to achieve a better economic output that instead resulted in a domestic crisis. Basic goods and food were being heavily [[Rationing|rationed]] which acted as a stimuli for the establishment of a first anti-communist [[trade union]] in the [[Eastern Bloc]], known as Solidarity, in 1980. Gierek, who permitted the trade union to appear per the [[Gda\u0144sk Agreement]], was dismissed from his post less than a month later under pressure from the USSR and confined to [[house arrest]]. Poland's already somewhat liberal policies concerning the opposition were worrisome for hardliners in the [[Soviet Union]], who feared that the Poles may overthrow communism and ally themselves with the [[Western Bloc]]. The Soviets were particularly uneasy as the departure of Eastern Bloc's most populous nation from [[Comecon]] would trigger further financial and economic problems that would bring an end to communist rule in Central-Eastern Europe. After a series of strikes and demonstrations by employees of chief industrial regions, Poland was directly heading towards bankruptcy. \n\nThe [[Military Council of National Salvation]] was formed by the new First Secretary of the Polish United Workers' Party, General [[Wojciech Jaruzelski]], who was determined to put an end to the demonstrations and crush the opposition by force if necessary. There is speculation whether Jaruzelski instigated martial law to prevent bloodshed if the Soviets and other [[Warsaw Pact]] countries were to enter Poland under the mutual assistance treaty, like in the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]] and the [[invasion of Czechoslovakia in 1968]]. On 13 December 1981, Jaruzelski announced the introduction of martial law in a televised speech addressed to the entire nation. The Polish People's Army, [[Citizen's Militia]] (MO), [[ZOMO]] special units and tanks rolled onto the streets to scare off demonstrators, begin regular patrols and maintain [[curfew]]. Intercity travelling was forbidden unless a permit was granted by the authorities. Food rationing intensified and there were shortages of every basic product. The [[S\u0142u\u017cba Bezpiecze\u0144stwa|secret services (SB)]] [[wiretapped]] phones in public booths and state institutions. \n\nOn 16 December, pro-Solidarity miners organized a strike against the declaration of the martial law at the [[Wujek Coal Mine]] in the industrial city of [[Katowice]]. The ZOMO squads, nicknamed \"Communist [[Gestapo]]\" by the opposition, brutally [[Pacification of Wujek|pacified Wujek]], which resulted in the deaths of 9 miners. All other [[1982 demonstrations in Poland|demonstrations across Poland]] were met with armed force of the services, which utilized [[water cannons]], [[tear gas]], [[Baton (law enforcement)|batons]], truncheons and clubs to disperse crowds and beat protesters. Thousands were detained and some were tortured in state prisons. On 31 August 1982, the copper-mining town of [[Lubin]], 3 people were mortally wounded by ZOMO. Until the end of the martial law on 22 July 1983, approximately 91 people were killed, though this figure varies and is still debated among historians.<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6175517.stm Poland marks communist crackdown], [[BBC News]], 13 December 2006</ref>\n\n==Declaration==\nLed by [[General of the Army]] [[Wojciech Jaruzelski]], the [[Military Council of National Salvation]] (''Wojskowa Rada Ocalenia Narodowego'', WRON) usurped for itself powers reserved for wartime, hence the name. The plan was presented to the government of the [[Soviet Union]] before the declaration in March 1981.\n\nAppearing on Polish television at 6:00 a.m. on 13 December 1981, General Jaruzelski said:<ref>The original is available at [http://www.konflikty.pl/a,395,Czasy_najnowsze,Przemowienie_gen._Jaruzelskiego.html Konflikty.pl] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121112060937/http://www.konflikty.pl/a,395,Czasy_najnowsze,Przemowienie_gen._Jaruzelskiego.html |date=2012-11-12 }}</ref>\n\n<blockquote>Today I address myself to you as a soldier and as the head of the Polish government. I address you concerning extraordinarily important questions. Our homeland is at the edge of an abyss. The achievements of many generations and the Polish home that has been built up from the dust are about to turn into ruins. State structures are ceasing to function. Each day delivers new blows to the waning economy./.../<br>The atmosphere of conflicts, misunderstanding, hatred causes moral degradation, surpasses the limits of toleration. Strikes, the readiness to strike, actions of protest have become a norm of life. Even school youth are being drawn into this. Yesterday evening, many public buildings remained seized. The cries are voiced to physical reprisals with the 'reds', with people who have different opinions. <br>The cases of terror, threats and moral vendetta, of even direct violence are on the rise. A wave of impudent crimes, robberies and burglaries is running across the country. The underground business sharks' fortunes, already reaching millions, are growing. Chaos and demoralization have reached the magnitude of a catastrophe. People have reached the limit of psychological toleration. Many people are struck by despair. Not only days, but hours as well are bringing forth the all-national disaster./.../<br>Citizens!<br>The load of responsibility that falls on me on this dramatic moment in the Polish history is huge. It is my duty to take this responsibility - concerning the future of Poland, that my generation fought for on all the fronts of the war and for which they sacrificed the best years of their life. I declare, that today the Military Council of National Salvation has been formed. In accordance with the Constitution, the State Council has imposed martial law all over the country. I wish that everyone understood the motives of our actions. A military coup, military dictatorship is not our goal./.../<br> In longer perspective, none of Poland's problems can be solved with the use of violence. The Military Council of National Salvation does not replace constitutional organs of power. Its only purpose is to keep the legal balance of the country, to create guarantees that give a chance to restore order and discipline. This is the ultimate way to bring the country out of the crisis, to save the country from collapse./.../<br>I appeal to all the citizens. A time of heavy trials has arrived. And we have to stand those in order to prove that we are worthy of Poland.<br>Before all the Polish people and the whole world I would like to repeat the immortal words: <br>\n::'''''[[Poland Is Not Yet Lost|Poland has not yet perished, so long as we still live]]!'''''</blockquote>\n\n<gallery widths=\"200px\" heights=\"200px\">\nFile:AGAD_Gen._Wojciech_jaruzelski_13_grudnia_1981.png|Wojciech Jaruzelski in a TV studio to read a speech announcing the introduction of martial law\nFile:Stan wojenny obwieszczenie.jpg|The proclamation of martial law by the State Council\nFile:Stan wojenny w Polsce - 1981-1983 - 12a.JPG|Members of the [[Milicja_Obywatelska|Citizens' Militia]] race to disperse crowds of protesters\n</gallery>\n\n==Martial law==\n[[File:Telegr.jpg|thumb|A censored telegram, 1982]]\n\nGeneral Jaruzelski had ordered the Polish General Staff to update plans for nationwide martial law on 22 October 1980.<ref>''From Solidarity to Martial Law: The Polish Crisis of 1980\u20131981: A Documentary History'' by Andrzej Paczkowski, Malcolm Byrne.

A [[curfew]] was imposed, the national borders sealed, airports closed, and road access to main cities restricted. Telephone lines were disconnected, mail subject to renewed [[postal censorship]], all independent official organizations were criminalized, and classes in schools and universities suspended.\n\nDuring the initial imposition of martial law, several dozen people were killed. Official reports during the crackdown claimed about a dozen fatalities, while a [[Sejm of the Republic of Poland|parliamentary]] commission in the years 1989\u20131991 arrived at a figure of over 90.<ref>[http://wyborcza.pl/1,77062,3787704.html Ofiary stanu wojennego i lat nast\u0119pnych do 1989] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140108144638/http://wyborcza.pl/1,77062,3787704.html |date=2014-01-08 }} by Piotr Lipi\u0144ski</ref> In the deadliest incident, nine coal miners were killed by: \"[[ZOMO]]\" paramilitary police during the [[strike-breaking]] at the [[Pacification of Wujek]] on 16 December 1981.

As part of the crackdown, media and educational institutions underwent \"verification\", a process that tested each employee's attitude towards the regime and to the Solidarity movement; as a result, thousands of journalists, teachers and professors were banned from their professions. [[Military court]]s were established to bypass the normal court system, to imprison those spreading \"false information\".<ref>[http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/english/static/special_report/1999/09/99/iron_curtain/timelines/poland_81.stm 1981: Martial law], [[BBC]]</ref> In an attempt to crush resistance, civilian phone lines were routinely tapped and monitored by government agents.\n\nAt the invitation of Jaruzelski, a delegation of the ruling [[Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party]] visited Poland between 27 and 29 December.

It also led to severe economic consequences. The ruling [[military dictatorship]] instituted major price rises (dubbed \"economic reforms\"), which resulted in a fall in real wages of 20% or more. The resulting [[economic crisis]] led to the [[rationing]] of most products and materials, including basic foodstuffs.\n\nAs a consequence of economic hardship and political repression, an exodus of Poles saw 700,000 emigrate to the West between 1981 and 1989.<ref>[https://books.google.com/books?id=nypuJ8BARiMC&pg=PA7&lpg=PA7&dq=poland+economy+1980s&source=bl&ots=iR_fCDeyE6&sig=q2hNTHlJPvd7MOfHIhY-lEKmJsc&hl=en&ei=lLEbS6OKG8z_4Abzt4TnAg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=10&ved=0CDIQ6AEwCQ#v=onepage&q=poland%20economy%201980s&f=false Google Books]</ref> \nA number of international flights were even hijacked in attempts to flee the country and its economic problems.

[[Shin-ichiro Miki]], the actor who voices James in the original Japanese version of the ''Pok\u00e9mon'' anime, voices Charizard in both the Japanese and English-language versions of the anime. An orange, draconic Pok\u00e9mon, Charizard is the evolved form of [[Charmeleon]] and the final evolution of [[Charmander]].

Charizard appears in ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Origins]]'' with main character Red as its trainer. In this series, Charizard is iconic, because it was the first Pok\u00e9mon to Mega Evolve into [[Mega Charizard X]] and it helped beat [[Mewtwo]]. Charizard has received positive reception from the media, with [[GamesRadar]] describing it as \"hands-down one of the coolest Pok\u00e9mon out there\". Charizard is the version mascot of ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Red]]'' and ''[[Pok\u00e9mon FireRed and LeafGreen|FireRed]]'' versions, and makes an appearance on the boxarts of ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Stadium]]'', ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Ranger]]'', ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team]]'', ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Mystery Dungeon: Explorers of Sky]]'', and ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Super Mystery Dungeon]]''.

Its plantigrade feet have the bottom mostly covered by a single pad that is cream-colored like its belly, while its eyes are light blue in color. When Charizard is Mega Evolved, it can take on one of two forms. Both forms are characterized by white pupils, bigger and sharper teeth, claws and horns and the bright coloring of the belly reaching the whole bottom of the muzzle, that also features a more pronounced beak. In its \"X\" form, its color scheme changes from orange and cream to black and blue, with red eyes, two claws appearing on each shoulder and wings acquiring a multilobed, feather-like structure. The flame at the tip of its tail becomes blue and blue flames are constantly breathed out from the sides of its mouth. In its \"Y\" form, its appearance is influenced by that of [[Pteranodon]]s, with a central big pointed horn, loss of fingers passing through the patagia of the main wings that increase in size, smaller wings stemming from Pteranodon-like hands. It also gains a more slender appearance with a thinner torso, a longer tail and digitigrade feet that are longer and devoid of pads.\n\nThe video games describe Charizard as having wings that can carry them close to an altitude of 4,600&nbsp;feet,<ref name=\"dexfirered\">{{pok\u00e9dex|firered|Its wings can carry this Pok\u00e9mon close to an altitude of 4,600&nbsp;feet.

Despite that, the ''Charizard's Burning Ambition'' episode showed Ash's Charizard surviving when going into water and the ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Chronicles]]'' episode known as ''Those Darn Electabuzz!'' even showed a Charizard named Don being able to rescue people underwater and then going out of water at enough speed to keep flying. Eventually, the ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Origins]]'' episode known as ''Charizard'' confirmed that the flame at the tip of Charizard's tail keeps burning in water, and Charizard is able to swim.\n\nWidely popular augmented reality mobile game, ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Go]]'', describes Charizard as a flame Pok\u00e9mon. In ''[[Pok\u00e9mon Go]]'', Charizard exists in two forms, its original form with orange body and a cream-coloured patch on its belly, and its shiny form, which is a gray body with the same cream-coloured patch on its belly. Charizard's shiny form first made its appearance on 19 May 2018, during ''Pok\u00e9mon Go'''s Community Day event featuring Charmander. During the Community Day event, shiny Charmander may be encountered, which can be evolved into a shiny Charmeleon, and in turn evolved into a shiny Charizard.\n\n=== [[Pok\u00e9mon competitive play|Competitive battling]] ===\nFrom its release in the first generation to [[Pok\u00e9mon Black and White|the fifth generation]], Charizard failed to make a major impact on the competitive scene, to the point where it \"wasn't seen in serious competitive play\"<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.serebii.net/potw-xy/006.shtml|title=Pok\u00e9mon of the Week - Charizard|website=www.serebii.net|access-date=2018-09-10}}</ref> and was \"doomed...to be forgotten.\"<ref name=\":0\">{{Cite news|url=https://www.thegamer.com/pokemon-fans-use-bad-stats/|title=The 25 Worst Gen 1 Pok\u00e9mon Everyone Uses (Even Though They Have The Worst Stats)|date=2018-09-02|work=TheGamer|access-date=2018-09-10|language=en-US}}</ref> This relative lack of viability, combined with its relentless popularity, gave it an unfavorable \"reputation of a Pok\u00e9mon that represents the [[fanboy]]s.\"<ref name=\":1\"/> It periodically found niches, as with the boosting move Belly Drum,<ref name=\":0\" /> but was crippled by [[Pok\u00e9mon Diamond and Pearl|the fourth generation]]'s entry hazard Stealth Rock, which removed half of its health upon entering the battle while active.<ref name=\":0\" /><ref name=\":1\">{{cite web|url=https://www.smogon.com/smog/issue23/starters|title=About the Starters: The Fire-types|last=|first=|date=|website=Smogon|access-date=10 September 2018}}</ref> [[Pok\u00e9mon X and Y|The sixth generation]] rescued Charizard's competitive status by introducing its Mega Charizard X and Mega Charizard Y forms, transforming it into a \"top-level threat\" of [[Pok\u00e9mon#Cultural Influence|Smogon's]] standard tier<ref name=\":1\" /><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.smogon.com/dex/xy/pokemon/charizard/|title=Charizard XY Analysis|last=|first=|date=|website=Smogon|access-date=10 September 2018}}</ref> and making it \"very good\" in the [[Pok\u00e9mon World Championships]] as per 2016 runner-up Jonathan Evans.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kotaku.co.uk/2018/08/30/the-pokemon-world-championships-and-the-players-who-want-to-be-the-very-best|title=The Pokemon World Championships, and the Players Who Want to be The Very Best|website=Kotaku UK|language=en|access-date=2018-09-10}}</ref> It often remains a strong pick, despite sometimes being troubled by new Pok\u00e9mon.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.smogon.com/dex/sm/pokemon/charizard/|title=Charizard SM Analysis|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=10 September 2018}}</ref>{{clear}}\n\n==Appearances==\n\n===In video games===\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Charizard (Super Smash Bros.

Its plantigrade feet have the bottom mostly covered by a single pad that is cream-colored like its belly, while its eyes are light blue in color. When Charizard is Mega Evolved, it can take on one of two forms. Both forms are characterized by white pupils, bigger and sharper teeth, claws and horns and the bright coloring of the belly reaching the whole bottom of the muzzle, that also features a more pronounced beak. In its \"X\" form, its color scheme changes from orange and cream to black and blue, with red eyes, two claws appearing on each shoulder and wings acquiring a multilobed, feather-like structure. The flame at the tip of its tail becomes blue and blue flames are constantly breathed out from the sides of its mouth. In its \"Y\" form, its appearance is influenced by that of [[Pteranodon]]s, with a central big pointed horn, loss of fingers passing through the patagia of the main wings that increase in size, smaller wings stemming from Pteranodon-like hands. It also gains a more slender appearance with a thinner torso, a longer tail and digitigrade feet that are longer and devoid of pads.\n\nThe video games describe Charizard as having wings that can carry them close to an altitude of 4,600&nbsp;feet,<ref name=\"dexfirered\">{{pok\u00e9dex|firered|Its wings can carry this Pok\u00e9mon close to an altitude of 4,600&nbsp;feet.

There are no auxiliary or business routes connected to I-43; however, as of late 2015 there is a signed alternate route in Milwaukee County.\n\nI-43 came about as a result of toll road proposals that included a Milwaukee to [[Superior, Wisconsin|Superior]] corridor that included [[Hurley, Wisconsin|Hurley]], [[Wausau, Wisconsin|Wausau]] and Green Bay. Only the Milwaukee-to-Green Bay section was approved. The route was originally planned to follow an alignment about midway between US&nbsp;41 and US&nbsp;141 (the latter paralleled Lake Michigan at the time) along WIS&nbsp;57. Controversy about this location and use of [[right-of-way (transportation)|right-of-way]] led to the establishment of the current alignment, which follows much of what was the 1950s-era realignment of US&nbsp;141 from Milwaukee to [[Sheboygan, Wisconsin|Sheboygan]], and a new alignment from Sheboygan to Green Bay. This section was completed in 1981.\n\nThe Beloit-to-Milwaukee segment was developed after two separate proposals for Interstates, one of them between Milwaukee and Beloit and the other between Milwaukee and [[Janesville, Wisconsin|Janesville]]. The Milwaukee\u2013Beloit route was chosen, completed in 1976 as WIS&nbsp;15 and renumbered as I-43 in 1988. To connect the two segments, I-43 was signed concurrently with the east\u2013west segment of I-894 and the north\u2013south portion of I-94 in the greater Milwaukee metropolitan area from I-894 to the [[Marquette Interchange]], which was completely reconstructed with work being completed in 2008.\n\n==History==\n[[File:I43atU S 151Sign.jpg|thumb|left|I-43 in Manitowoc]]\nWisconsin had anticipated the Interstates with studies of possible toll roads. When the original Interstate system was approved the state was only given two routes: I-90 and I-94.<ref name=\"FHWA_I43\"/> The Wisconsin Transportation Commission submitted a request to add an Interstate in 1953 connecting Milwaukee to Green Bay, a request the federal government denied. The commission, after a study by Wisconsin Turnpike Commission\u2014which was established in 1953\u2014submitted a request in 1963 for a route that connected Milwaukee and Superior by way of Green Bay, Wausau, Hurley and [[Ashland, Wisconsin|Ashland]] which could be completed in increments.

Construction first began in 1963 on the freeway that was at the time designated US&nbsp;141. The first segment to begin construction was a {{convert|3.4|mi|km|adj=on}} segment beginning at the Port Washington Road exit in Milwaukee County. An additional {{convert|10|mi|km}} of the highway were completed in Ozaukee County by 1964.<ref name=\"FHWA_I43\"/> In 1965, a {{convert|9.3|mi|km|adj=on}} bypass of Sheboygan opened to traffic. The last major segment, consisting of {{convert|94.4|mi|km}} of roadway, was started in 1972 after the last of these governments, Manitowoc County, pledged its support.<ref name=\"I43_steal\"/> The portion in Milwaukee County extending from the Port Washington Road exit to the Marquette Interchange was completed in 1981 to open the route.<ref name=\"FHWA_I43\"/>\n\nThe southwestern portion has also had a history of requests for Interstate routings. Interstate routings for such a connection between Beloit and the Milwaukee metropolitan area were requested by the [[Wisconsin Department of Transportation]] (WisDOT) but denied by the [[Federal Highway Administration]] (FHWA) in 1973. Another request for a link to Janesville was also denied. Despite the denials, local and state officials continued to seek funding to construct a freeway between these two metropolitan areas.<ref name=\"WISDOT_BB2\"/> A government collaboration called the \"Highway&nbsp;15 Committee\" was formed to present and promote the route. Construction began on the route in the 1960s with the first segment, a {{convert|0.9|mi|km|adj=on}} connector linking US&nbsp;45 with I-894 as part of the project to build the Hale Interchange connecting the pending route with I-894. The new connector received the US&nbsp;45 designation as that highway was transferred onto the freeway heading north. The first long segment was completed in 1969. It extended from the US&nbsp;45 connector to CTH-F (now [[Wisconsin Highway 164|WIS&nbsp;164]]) in Big Bend. After this segment was opened, the WIS&nbsp;15 designation was applied. The next segment, to [[East Troy, Wisconsin|East Troy]], was opened in 1972, the year the Highway&nbsp;15 Committee had hoped the route would be completed in its entirety. It was extended to [[Elkhorn, Wisconsin|Elkhorn]] in 1973 in conjunction with the [[U.S. Route 12 in Wisconsin|US&nbsp;12]] freeway construction, then to I-90 in 1976. I-43 signs were placed on the freeway by 1988 after designation in 1987, replacing WIS&nbsp;15.

There are no auxiliary or business routes connected to I-43; however, as of late 2015 there is a signed alternate route in Milwaukee County.\n\nI-43 came about as a result of toll road proposals that included a Milwaukee to [[Superior, Wisconsin|Superior]] corridor that included [[Hurley, Wisconsin|Hurley]], [[Wausau, Wisconsin|Wausau]] and Green Bay. Only the Milwaukee-to-Green Bay section was approved. The route was originally planned to follow an alignment about midway between US&nbsp;41 and US&nbsp;141 (the latter paralleled Lake Michigan at the time) along WIS&nbsp;57. Controversy about this location and use of [[right-of-way (transportation)|right-of-way]] led to the establishment of the current alignment, which follows much of what was the 1950s-era realignment of US&nbsp;141 from Milwaukee to [[Sheboygan, Wisconsin|Sheboygan]], and a new alignment from Sheboygan to Green Bay. This section was completed in 1981.\n\nThe Beloit-to-Milwaukee segment was developed after two separate proposals for Interstates, one of them between Milwaukee and Beloit and the other between Milwaukee and [[Janesville, Wisconsin|Janesville]]. The Milwaukee\u2013Beloit route was chosen, completed in 1976 as WIS&nbsp;15 and renumbered as I-43 in 1988. To connect the two segments, I-43 was signed concurrently with the east\u2013west segment of I-894 and the north\u2013south portion of I-94 in the greater Milwaukee metropolitan area from I-894 to the [[Marquette Interchange]], which was completely reconstructed with work being completed in 2008.\n\n==History==\n[[File:I43atU S 151Sign.jpg|thumb|left|I-43 in Manitowoc]]\nWisconsin had anticipated the Interstates with studies of possible toll roads. When the original Interstate system was approved the state was only given two routes: I-90 and I-94.<ref name=\"FHWA_I43\"/> The Wisconsin Transportation Commission submitted a request to add an Interstate in 1953 connecting Milwaukee to Green Bay, a request the federal government denied. The commission, after a study by Wisconsin Turnpike Commission\u2014which was established in 1953\u2014submitted a request in 1963 for a route that connected Milwaukee and Superior by way of Green Bay, Wausau, Hurley and [[Ashland, Wisconsin|Ashland]] which could be completed in increments. However, only the Milwaukee-to-Green Bay segment was approved.<ref name=\"WISDOT_BB2\">{{cite book |last= Bechtel |first= George |title= Wisconsin Highways: A History of Wisconsin Highway Development 1945\u20131985 |location= Madison |publisher= [[Wisconsin Department of Transportation]] |year= 1999}}</ref> The original plan for the northern part of I-43 was to locate it midway between US&nbsp;141 and US&nbsp;41, using most of the current alignment of WIS&nbsp;57 north of [[Wisconsin Highway 33|WIS&nbsp;33]] in [[Saukville, Wisconsin|Saukville]];<ref name=\"I43_steal\"/> additionally, it was proposed to use the [[Interstate 57]] number,<ref>{{AASHTO minutes |year = 1969S |page = 10 |access-date = November 15, 2017 |v-link = yes }}</ref> though that was changed due to resistance from Illinois to extend its portion through Chicago.{{cn|date=November 2017}} But farmers and landowners within the corridor opposed the plan. According to the opponents of the I-43 construction, what the commission revealed as their plan to construct I-43 along the WIS&nbsp;57 corridor did not reveal that instead of using the existing right-of-way, the freeway was to be built {{convert|2.25|mi|km}} west of WIS&nbsp;57. This was the case despite the fact that WIS&nbsp;57 had a wide right-of-way of {{convert|300|ft|m}}.<ref name=\"I43_steal\">{{cite book |last= Klessig |first= Edward |title= Interstate&nbsp;43: The Last Highway Steal in Wisconsin |publisher= [[State Historical Society of Wisconsin]] |location= Green Bay |year= 1974}}</ref> Protests, including farmers bringing their cows to graze on the [[Wisconsin State Capitol]] grounds, prompted a compromise to utilize the freeway built for US&nbsp;141 between Milwaukee and Sheboygan instead, building the remaining freeway for the Interstate itself.<ref name=\"WISDOT_BB2\"/> This plan, particularly the new freeway, met resistance from the [[Brown County, Wisconsin|Brown]], [[Sheboygan County, Wisconsin|Sheboygan]], and [[Manitowoc County, Wisconsin|Manitowoc]] county governments. Construction first began in 1963 on the freeway that was at the time designated US&nbsp;141. The first segment to begin construction was a {{convert|3.4|mi|km|adj=on}} segment beginning at the Port Washington Road exit in Milwaukee County. An additional {{convert|10|mi|km}} of the highway were completed in Ozaukee County by 1964.<ref name=\"FHWA_I43\"/> In 1965, a {{convert|9.3|mi|km|adj=on}} bypass of Sheboygan opened to traffic. The last major segment, consisting of {{convert|94.4|mi|km}} of roadway, was started in 1972 after the last of these governments, Manitowoc County, pledged its support.<ref name=\"I43_steal\"/> The portion in Milwaukee County extending from the Port Washington Road exit to the Marquette Interchange was completed in 1981 to open the route.<ref name=\"FHWA_I43\"/>\n\nThe southwestern portion has also had a history of requests for Interstate routings. Interstate routings for such a connection between Beloit and the Milwaukee metropolitan area were requested by the [[Wisconsin Department of Transportation]] (WisDOT) but denied by the [[Federal Highway Administration]] (FHWA) in 1973. Another request for a link to Janesville was also denied. Despite the denials, local and state officials continued to seek funding to construct a freeway between these two metropolitan areas.<ref name=\"WISDOT_BB2\"/> A government collaboration called the \"Highway&nbsp;15 Committee\" was formed to present and promote the route. Construction began on the route in the 1960s with the first segment, a {{convert|0.9|mi|km|adj=on}} connector linking US&nbsp;45 with I-894 as part of the project to build the Hale Interchange connecting the pending route with I-894. The new connector received the US&nbsp;45 designation as that highway was transferred onto the freeway heading north. The first long segment was completed in 1969. It extended from the US&nbsp;45 connector to CTH-F (now [[Wisconsin Highway 164|WIS&nbsp;164]]) in Big Bend. After this segment was opened, the WIS&nbsp;15 designation was applied. The next segment, to [[East Troy, Wisconsin|East Troy]], was opened in 1972, the year the Highway&nbsp;15 Committee had hoped the route would be completed in its entirety. It was extended to [[Elkhorn, Wisconsin|Elkhorn]] in 1973 in conjunction with the [[U.S. Route 12 in Wisconsin|US&nbsp;12]] freeway construction, then to I-90 in 1976. I-43 signs were placed on the freeway by 1988 after designation in 1987, replacing WIS&nbsp;15. I-43 was also mapped concurrently with I-94 and I-894 to link the two segments together.<ref name=\"WH_I43\">{{cite web |last= Bessert |first= Chris |title= Highways 40-49 |work= Wisconsin Highways |publisher= Self-published |url= http://www.wisconsinhighways.org/listings/WiscHwys40-49.html#I-043 |accessdate= January 17, 2008}}{{self-published source|date=March 2013}}</ref>{{self-published inline|date=March 2013}} Even though exit number tabs were labeled according to the new mileposts, the mileposts themselves were not renumbered to coincide with the current length until 1991.<ref name=\"JS1\">{{cite news |first= Amy Rabideau |last= Silvers |title= Sorry Milwaukee, but Beloit is the Starting Point for Measuring I-43 Mile markers and Exit Numbers Will Show the Mileage from Beloit |work=[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]] |date=August 15, 1990 |page=B3}}</ref>\n\nThe Marquette Interchange, which connects I-43 with I-94,and [[Interstate 794|I-794]], was completely reconstructed over a four-year span, beginning in October 2004 and ending in September 2008.

It is located in [[Towson, Maryland|Towson]], [[Maryland]], within the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Baltimore|Archdiocese of Baltimore]]. Students from [[Baltimore]], [[Baltimore County, Maryland|Baltimore County]], [[Harford County, Maryland|Harford County]], [[Carroll County, Maryland|Carroll County]], [[Howard County, Maryland|Howard County]], [[Anne Arundel County, Maryland|Anne Arundel County]], and Southern [[Pennsylvania]] attend the school. It enrolls over nine hundred students in grades six through twelve.\n\n== History ==\nArchbishop [[Francis Kenrick]] asked the Jesuits to oversee the formation of a school for laymen that would incorporate the Jesuit standards of excellence and build new men conscious of a religious purpose. His request was prompted by the 1852 closure of nearby St. Mary's College.  Construction of Loyola High School began on Charles Street in [[Baltimore|Baltimore, Maryland]], in early 1852, and on September 15, 1852, the school enrolled its first students.\n\nIn the early 1930s the growing and cramped high school began to look toward moving north of the city. In 1933, with the support of the Blake family, Loyola purchased the land known today as Blakefield in [[Towson, Maryland]]. In 1941, the students moved to the new campus. Between 1981 and 1988, a Middle School was gradually introduced, and in recognition of the two levels of education, Loyola High School officially became known as Loyola Blakefield.\n\nPhysical improvements in recent years have included the construction of Knott Hall which houses the student commons and dining hall, athletic center, and alumni areas, Burk Hall academic wing, renovations to the 60-year-old science laboratories, and construction of an additional section to Wheeler Hall.\n\nLoyola Blakefield has a tradition of honoring alumni from 50 years earlier at its graduation ceremony. \"Bring back the men from 50 years before to see a new generation graduate,\" writes James Maliszewski, whose grandfather died a year before they could have attended together as 1937 and 1987 graduates.<ref name=\"50year\">{{cite web|url=http://maliszew.livejournal.com/11166.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20140709095730/http://maliszew.livejournal.com/11166.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 9, 2014 |date=May 11, 2002 |title=May. 11th, 2002 journal entry |accessdate=July 6, 2014 |author=James Maliszewski }}</ref>\n\n==Athletics==\nLoyola Blakefield competes in the [[Maryland Interscholastic Athletic Association]] (MIAA) for all interscholastic sports except for football where they are independent; in addition to the MIAA, the basketball team is also a member of the [[Baltimore Catholic League]].\n\nThe Loyola Blakefield football team also plays every [[Thanksgiving|Thanksgiving Day]] in one of the [[List of high school football rivalries (less than 100 years old)|oldest continual national Catholic high school football rivalries]], against cross-town rival [[Calvert Hall College]]. The game, known as the [[American football on Thanksgiving|Turkey Bowl]], is held at [[M&T Bank Stadium]] in Baltimore and broadcast on television and radio by [[WMAR-TV]].\n\nThe Loyola [[lacrosse]] program is among its most successful.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}} It won eight championships in the 1980s and also won championships in 2001, 2007, 2008, and 2013. In 2007, they defeated [[Boys' Latin School of Maryland|Boys' Latin]] 10-6 in the MIAA championship game. In 2008, they defeated previously undefeated [[Gilman School|Gilman]] 12-11 in the championship game at [[Towson University]]'s Johnny Unitas Stadium before over 8,000 spectators.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}} Loyola has produced numerous players who have continued on to play collegiate lacrosse,{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}} including National Lacrosse Hall of Famer John Stewart, and Peter Kimmel.\n\nLoyola's swimming and diving team has also achieved remarkable successes, having recorded a record run of 20 [[Maryland Interscholastic Athletic Association]] state titles in 21 years and six National Catholic Swimming Championships crowns, whilst consistently being ranked within the National Interscholastic Swim Coaches Association national Top-25 Poll for best high school swimming teams.<ref>https://support.loyolablakefield.org/swimming</ref>\n\nThe soccer program won the Maryland Championship in 2001, 2012, and 2014 and has produced Division I talent. Coach [[Lee Tschantret]], a former longtime player in the [[Major Indoor Soccer League II|Major Indoor Soccer League]], won several championships with the [[Baltimore Blast (current)|Baltimore Blast]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}\n\nThe Loyola basketball program reached regional prominence in the 1970s when it was led by head coach Jerry Savage, who won over 600 games from 1969 to 2003.  He produced several Division I players.  Savage also coached the 1997 MIAA Championship team, the last championship of any sort for the Dons basketball program. Loyola has been in the most Baltimore Catholic League finals with 13 total and 6 championships. More recently, the program had several disappointing seasons and experienced a four-year period with four different head coaches.  Since then Josh Davalli, an All-Metro player at Cardinal Gibbons in the mid-1990s, served as varsity head coach while also teaching in the Middle School.\n\nThe Loyola [[Cross country running|Cross country]] program has had much success, being the first and only team in the MIAA to complete the \"[[Three-peat]]\", then continuing to win six consecutive individual and team titles at the Maryland Interscholastic Athletic Association championship meet. Under the coaching of Jose Albornoz, the Dons have won 14 MIAA/MSA championships to bring the program's total championships to 15 since its inception.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.loyolablakefield.org/page/team-detail?fromId=208019&Team=212101&SeasonLabel=2016+-+2017|title=Loyola Blakefield {{!}} Team Detail|website=www.loyolablakefield.org|access-date=2017-01-05}}</ref> \n\nLoyola was MIAA champions in rugby for three consecutive years from 2008 to 2010, and also in 2013 and 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.miaasports.net/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=102&Itemid=55|title=Past MIAA Varsity Rugby Champions|publisher=Miaasports.net|accessdate=28 December 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Notable alumni==\n{{alumni|date=January 2019}}\n===Journalism and entertainment===\n* [[Tom Clancy]], author\n* [[Jerry Kammer]], Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist\n* Tom Callahan, former senior writer for ''[[Time magazine]]'' and columnist for ''[[The Washington Post]]''. \n* [[Nathaniel Fick]], former USMC captain and author of [[One Bullet Away: The Making of a Marine Officer]]\n* [[Brendan Hines]], actor in Fox's [[Lie to Me]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2009-03-08/entertainment/0903060077_1_mentalist-cop-drama-new-american/2|title=Here's the truth: The new American TV villain is the liar|work=Baltimore Sun|accessdate=28 December 2014}}</ref>\n* [[Aaron LaCrate]], music producer and fashion designer\n* [[Thomas F.

Between 1981 and 1988, a Middle School was gradually introduced, and in recognition of the two levels of education, Loyola High School officially became known as Loyola Blakefield.\n\nPhysical improvements in recent years have included the construction of Knott Hall which houses the student commons and dining hall, athletic center, and alumni areas, Burk Hall academic wing, renovations to the 60-year-old science laboratories, and construction of an additional section to Wheeler Hall.\n\nLoyola Blakefield has a tradition of honoring alumni from 50 years earlier at its graduation ceremony. \"Bring back the men from 50 years before to see a new generation graduate,\" writes James Maliszewski, whose grandfather died a year before they could have attended together as 1937 and 1987 graduates.<ref name=\"50year\">{{cite web|url=http://maliszew.livejournal.com/11166.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20140709095730/http://maliszew.livejournal.com/11166.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=July 9, 2014 |date=May 11, 2002 |title=May. 11th, 2002 journal entry |accessdate=July 6, 2014 |author=James Maliszewski }}</ref>\n\n==Athletics==\nLoyola Blakefield competes in the [[Maryland Interscholastic Athletic Association]] (MIAA) for all interscholastic sports except for football where they are independent; in addition to the MIAA, the basketball team is also a member of the [[Baltimore Catholic League]].\n\nThe Loyola Blakefield football team also plays every [[Thanksgiving|Thanksgiving Day]] in one of the [[List of high school football rivalries (less than 100 years old)|oldest continual national Catholic high school football rivalries]], against cross-town rival [[Calvert Hall College]]. The game, known as the [[American football on Thanksgiving|Turkey Bowl]], is held at [[M&T Bank Stadium]] in Baltimore and broadcast on television and radio by [[WMAR-TV]].\n\nThe Loyola [[lacrosse]] program is among its most successful.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}} It won eight championships in the 1980s and also won championships in 2001, 2007, 2008, and 2013. In 2007, they defeated [[Boys' Latin School of Maryland|Boys' Latin]] 10-6 in the MIAA championship game. In 2008, they defeated previously undefeated [[Gilman School|Gilman]] 12-11 in the championship game at [[Towson University]]'s Johnny Unitas Stadium before over 8,000 spectators.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}} Loyola has produced numerous players who have continued on to play collegiate lacrosse,{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}} including National Lacrosse Hall of Famer John Stewart, and Peter Kimmel.\n\nLoyola's swimming and diving team has also achieved remarkable successes, having recorded a record run of 20 [[Maryland Interscholastic Athletic Association]] state titles in 21 years and six National Catholic Swimming Championships crowns, whilst consistently being ranked within the National Interscholastic Swim Coaches Association national Top-25 Poll for best high school swimming teams.<ref>https://support.loyolablakefield.org/swimming</ref>\n\nThe soccer program won the Maryland Championship in 2001, 2012, and 2014 and has produced Division I talent. Coach [[Lee Tschantret]], a former longtime player in the [[Major Indoor Soccer League II|Major Indoor Soccer League]], won several championships with the [[Baltimore Blast (current)|Baltimore Blast]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}\n\nThe Loyola basketball program reached regional prominence in the 1970s when it was led by head coach Jerry Savage, who won over 600 games from 1969 to 2003.  He produced several Division I players.  Savage also coached the 1997 MIAA Championship team, the last championship of any sort for the Dons basketball program. Loyola has been in the most Baltimore Catholic League finals with 13 total and 6 championships. More recently, the program had several disappointing seasons and experienced a four-year period with four different head coaches.  Since then Josh Davalli, an All-Metro player at Cardinal Gibbons in the mid-90's, served as varsity head coach while also teaching in the Middle School.\n\nThe Loyola [[Cross country running|Cross country]] program has had much success, being the first and only team in the MIAA to complete the \"[[Three-peat]]\", then continuing to win six consecutive individual and team titles at the Maryland Interscholastic Athletic Association championship meet. Under the coaching of Jose Albornoz, the Dons have won 14 MIAA/MSA championships to bring the program's total championships to 15 since its inception.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.loyolablakefield.org/page/team-detail?fromId=208019&Team=212101&SeasonLabel=2016+-+2017|title=Loyola Blakefield {{!}} Team Detail|website=www.loyolablakefield.org|access-date=2017-01-05}}</ref> \n\nLoyola was MIAA champions in rugby for three consecutive years from 2008 to 2010, and also in 2013 and 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.miaasports.net/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=102&Itemid=55|title=Past MIAA Varsity Rugby Champions|publisher=Miaasports.net|accessdate=28 December 2014}}</ref>\n\n==Notable alumni==\n{{alumni|date=January 2019}}\n===Journalism and entertainment===\n* [[Tom Clancy]], author\n* [[Jerry Kammer]], Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist\n* Tom Callahan, former senior writer for ''[[Time magazine]]'' and columnist for ''[[The Washington Post]]''. \n* [[Nathaniel Fick]], former USMC captain and author of [[One Bullet Away: The Making of a Marine Officer]]\n* [[Brendan Hines]], actor in Fox's [[Lie to Me]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2009-03-08/entertainment/0903060077_1_mentalist-cop-drama-new-american/2|title=Here's the truth: The new American TV villain is the liar|work=Baltimore Sun|accessdate=28 December 2014}}</ref>\n* [[Aaron LaCrate]], music producer and fashion designer\n* [[Thomas F.

However, the Dark Knight does care for his lost progeny.<ref name=\"Batman #658\">''Batman'' #658</ref> After the events of ''[[Batman R.I.P.]]'' and ''[[Batman: Battle for the Cowl]]'', he takes the role of Robin at ten years of age,<ref>''Batman and Robin'' #2</ref> becoming the fifth person to use the Robin persona.

''Brotherhood of the Bat'' features a future in which Ra's al Ghul discovers the Batcave following [[Bruce Wayne]]'s death, and outfits the League of Assassins in variant Batman costumes based on [[Batman: Knight Gallery|Wayne's rejected designs]]. Talia and Bruce's son join the Brotherhood in his father's costume, to destroy it from within. <ref>''Batman: Brotherhood of the Bat''</ref>\n\nIn ''Kingdom Come'' (1996) by [[Mark Waid]] and [[Alex Ross]], which functioned as a possible future to the canon of the time, the child of Batman and Talia is named '''Ibn al Xu'ffasch''', literally \"Son of the Bat\", and a member of [[Lex Luthor]]'s inner circle. He falls in love with [[Nightstar (character)|Nightstar]], the daughter of [[Dick Grayson]] and [[Starfire (Teen Titans)|Starfire]]. He works as a double agent for Batman in Luthor's organization.<ref>{{cite web|author=Jess Nevins |url=http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Olympus/7160/kc3.html |title=''Kingdom Come'' #3 Annotations |accessdate=December 29, 2010 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20091026172243/http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Olympus/7160/kc3.html |archivedate = October 26, 2009}}</ref> In the [[Elliot S! Maggin]] novelization of ''Kingdom Come'', al Xu'ffasch tells Bruce that his mother Talia is still alive and working as a Mother Superior in [[India]], one of [[Mother Teresa]]'s successors. al Xu'ffasch reappears in Waid's 1999 sequel ''[[The Kingdom (comics)|The Kingdom]]''.\n\n[[File:SonoftheBat.png|thumb|upright|Ibn al Xu'ffasch holding [[Nightstar (character)|Nightstar]] on the cover art of ''The Kingdom: Son of the Bat'' #1 (February 1999); art by Brian Apthorp]]\n''The Kingdom: Son of the Bat'' shows flashbacks that shed new insights into Ibn al Xu'ffasch's history: that he was reared by Ra's al Ghul to be the heir to his empire, that he eventually murdered his grandfather (cutting off his head to prevent yet another regeneration), and that he sought therapy from psychiatrist Dr. Gibson. He was eventually recruited by [[Rip Hunter]] to try to stop a madman named [[Gog (DC Comics)|Gog]] from altering his history. He works with several other heroes of his generation \u2013 [[Kid Flash (Iris West)|Kid Flash]], the daughter of the [[Flash (comics)|Flash]] ([[Wally West]]); Nightstar and [[Offspring (comics)|Offspring]], the son of [[Plastic Man]].\n\nIn ''League of Batmen'' (2001), the sequel to ''Brotherhood of the Bat'', Tallant leads his own team of variant Batmen to combat the plague that was al Ghul's legacy. During the battle, Tallant discovers that his grandfather is the one who murdered his father and then cloned him. Ra's even sent the clone to murder his own daughter. Because the deaths of his parents at Ra's's hands, Tallant has completed following his father's tragic path as Batman. The new Dark Knight desires justice for his parents along with trying to stop his grandfather, while having to battle his father's murderous double.\n\nGrant Morrison's story titled ''Batman and Son'' (2006) expands upon the ''Son of the Demon'' storyline as part of a remodeling of Batman's personality after the events of ''[[Infinite Crisis]]''. In Morrison's version, the child Damian Wayne is the result of a tryst between Batman and Talia, during which the Dark Knight claims he was drugged when they were at the [[Tropic of Cancer]], though Morrison later admitted the claim of drugging was a canonical error on his part. Since then however in issues of the Morrison penned ''Batman Incorporated'', the drugging is reaffirmed and is once again part of Damian's origin.<ref>''Batman Incorporated'' Vol. 2 #2 (June 2012)</ref> \n\nThe final issue of ''[[52 (comics)|52]]'' (2008) designates the ''Kingdom Come'' alternate universe as Earth-22, thus making the Ibn al Xu'ffasch version part of the [[DC Multiverse]] and Damian Wayne's parallel universe counterpart. ''Justice Society of America'' vol. 3 #22 (2009) reveals that he would eventually marry [[Nightstar (comics)|Nightstar (Mar'i Grayson)]] with whom he would have a daughter and son.\n\n==Fictional Character Biography==\n\n===''Batman and Son''===\n{{Main|Batman and Son}}\n[[File:Proto-Robin (Damian Wayne).png|right|thumb|upright|Damian Wayne in ''Batman'' #658 (December 2006). Art by [[Andy Kubert]].]]\nDamian's origin is unknown to Batman. Genetically perfected and grown in an artificial womb, Damian was intended to be a formidable warrior. He is raised by his mother [[Talia al Ghul]] and the [[League of Assassins]]. He becomes a talented martial artist before his teenage years, at which time Talia reveals Damian's existence to Bruce Wayne and leaves him in Batman's custody in an effort to disrupt Batman's work.\n\nPrecocious, spoiled, and violent, Damian battles [[Tim Drake]], whom he wants to replace as [[Robin (comics)|Robin]], and sucker punches Tim off the stuffed [[Tyrannosaurus]] in the [[Batcave]] when Tim stops fighting to help him. Damian then escapes, dons a variant Robin costume made of [[Jason Todd]]'s old tunic and mask and assorted League of Assassin gear, and gets into a fight with and decapitates the villainous Spook. Although misguided, Damian seems to genuinely want to aid Bruce's war on crime as he is Bruce's son and wants his approval. Unfortunately, because of how he was raised, Damian lacks any sort of common sense in regards to social behavior, and believes that in order to be accepted by his father, he must kill any rivals, which included Tim Drake. This troubles his relationship with Batman, who vows never to kill. However, because of his possible paternity to Damian, Batman, on some levels, is optimistic by the chance of fatherhood. \n\nEventually, Batman confronts Talia to confirm Damian's true identity, but both Talia and Damian are soon caught in an explosion. They survive the explosion. However, Damian's badly injured body requires transplants of harvested organs, which his mother orders her physicians to carry out. Damian makes a full recovery.<ref>''Batman'' #665</ref>\n\n===''The Resurrection of Ra's al Ghul''===\n{{Main|Batman: The Resurrection of Ra's al Ghul}}\nBeginning in ''Batman Annual #26 (\"Head of the Demon\")'', Talia takes Damian to the Australian [[Outback]], where he is tutored in the secret history of his grandfather Ra's al Ghul. Talia is unaware that a former servant of Ra's, named White Ghost, plans to use Damian as a shell for the soul of Ra's to return to Earth. This process would, of course, kill Damian. Talia is able to save her son from his fate at the last minute.\n\nRa's is still able to return, but as a rotting, shambling undead corpse, still needing Damian to stabilize his form. Damian flees to alert Batman, but is pursued by his evil grandfather. Upon entering [[Wayne Manor]], Damian attempts to relay to ([[Tim Drake]]) the fact that Ra's has returned. Tim, suspicious of Damian's intentions, does not believe his story and begins a fist fight. Damian flees and encounters Alfred. Before he can effectively relay his news, he is attacked by Tim, who perceives Damian's attempt to help a tripping Alfred as an attack, and renews their battle. As they fight, members of the League of Assassins approach the manor with the intention of killing all others within and bringing Damian back to Ra's alive. Damian and Tim fight side by side against Ra's and his minions. Their collaboration is hindered by their very different philosophies of battle. Damian is willing to betray Tim at any moment for his own safety. Ra's captures the two and tells Batman that he will use one of them for his own body. Batman offers his own body instead.\n\nRa's refuses the offer, feeling that he needs someone of a younger age. The choices are Tim or Damian. Batman offers a third alternative: \"Fountain of Essence\" which contains the qualities of a [[Lazarus Pit]]. Batman and Ra's go in search of the fountain, leaving Tim, Damian, [[Nightwing]], [[Alfred Pennyworth]] and Talia to battle the [[Sensei (DC Comics)|Sensei]]. Damian leaves his mother and Tim to an unknown fate, while he goes off to be with his father. He ends up captured by Ra's and nearly loses his life. Batman and the others manage to save him, and Talia takes her son and escapes.\n\nA subsequent conversation between Tim and Alfred implies that Batman has carried out a DNA test on Damian. Alfred says Bruce intended to tell him the results when the time was right. At this, Tim realizes that Damian is indeed Bruce's son, and exclaims \"The son of Satan is my brother?\"<ref>\"Did he do a paternity test on Damian? You know, like a DNA test... He had to, right? Alfred? -Tim Drake \"He insisted he would tell you the results himself when the time was right.\" -Alfred \"So you know. You both know and nobody is going to tell me?\" -Tim Drake \"It's not my place to say, young sir. Forgive me.\" -Alfred \"The son of Satan is my brother?\" -Tim Drake. Dialogue post-midway through comic book (\"son of Satan\" likely in reference to ''The Omen'' franchise). \"Morrison, Grant. ''Batman #676''. DC Comics, Inc., 2008</ref>\n\n===''Batman R.I.P.''===\n{{Main|Batman R.I.P.}}\nPrior to the start of Grant Morrison's \"[[Batman R.I.P.]]\" story arc in ''Batman'' #675, Damian senses that someone is out to get Batman. In response to this, Talia begins formulating a plan involving Commissioner [[James Gordon (comics)|James Gordon]], whom Talia and Damian rescue from a booby-trapped Wayne Manor while in search of Batman, who is insane and has gone missing.\n\nDamian and Alfred race to aid Batman against the Black Glove in a commandeered [[Batmobile]]. Damian, who is driving, knocks an ambulance off a bridge without any sign of remorse or even concern. When Alfred reprimands him, Damian retorts with a backhanded threat. The only occupant of the ambulance was the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]].\n\n===''Battle for the Cowl''===\n{{Main|Batman: Battle for the Cowl}}\nIn ''Nightwing'' #153 (2009), Damian is shown being left in the care of [[Alfred Pennyworth]] and trained by [[Dick Grayson]] (alias Nightwing).\n\nUpon the start of ''Batman: Battle for the Cowl'', it appears that Damian is now residing in Gotham, and living under the command of Nightwing (to an extent). Where before Damian portrayed an arrogant and vicious personality, it appears the \"death\" of his father has regressed him to a more childlike mindset, as demonstrated when he takes the Batmobile joy-riding with an older girl. This is discovered by [[Barbara Gordon|Oracle]], who ejects the girl and takes control of the Batmobile, intent on taking Damian home. The car is blindsided by [[Killer Croc]] and [[Poison Ivy (comics)|Poison Ivy]], who prepare to kill Damian. The older girl (Damian's companion) is later eaten by Killer Croc.<ref>''Batman: Battle for the Cowl'' #1 (2009)</ref> Damian is saved by Nightwing who ends up being cornered by [[Black Mask (comics)|Black Mask]]'s men, until a murderous figure appears stating that he is Batman (later revealed to be Jason Todd). Although shot by Todd, Damian recovers and saves Tim Drake from falling to death inside Jason's Batcave.<ref>''Batman: Battle for the Cowl'' #2 (2009)</ref> When Grayson hangs up his Nightwing mantle to become the newest Batman, he chooses Damian to assume the mantle of Robin by his side.<ref>''Batman: Battle for the Cowl'' #3 (2009)</ref>\n\n===''Batman: Reborn''===\n{{Main|Batman: Reborn}}\nDespite becoming Robin to Grayson's Batman, Damian reveals that he cares little for his older brother and has no respect for him as Batman and that the latter would have to earn it. In an act of defiance, Damian decides to make the Robin mantle independent from that of Batman and decides to stop [[Doctor Phosphorus|Dr. Phosphorus]] from breaking into [[Project Cadmus]], but fails miserably and is saved by Dick. Dick then begins to train Damian as to how to properly become the new Robin and the two develop their own unique crime fighting style. Damian then begins to mock Tim Drake for not being chosen as Robin, causing Tim to severely beat Damian, only to be stopped by Dick.\n\nAfter Tim leaves, Damian starts engaging in chess games with [[Hush (comics)|Hush]], visiting him secretly against Dick's orders. When Elliot asked why Damian is visiting him behind the Bat-family's back, Damian shrugs it off as a desire to keep Elliot company. Elliot surmises that Damian is rather using the resemblance to Bruce to \"spend time with [his] old man\". Dick and Damian then encounter a villain called [[Professor Pyg]], who has created an army called Dollotrons. Dick and Damian take the entire army down and begin to form a brotherly relationship. Damian blames himself for being unable to save a single Dollotron, a girl named Sasha, but unbeknownst to him, the girl is taken in by Jason Todd, who had shot Damian,<ref>''Batman & Robin'' vol.3 #3 (2009)</ref> thereby becoming the new Robin's opposite number in Red Hood's no-holds-barred war against crime (Red Hood's maxim is \"let the punishment fit the crime\").<ref>''Batman & Robin'' vol. 3 #4 (2009)</ref>\n\nDamian and Dick then attack Firefly, who is attempting to kill Black Mask. Victor Zsasz defeats Robin and rescues Black Mask while Dick takes down Firefly. These events cause Hush to escape, causing Damian to grow a further hatred for the criminal. Damian is present when Dick is inducted into the JLA, upon hearing, Damian demands to be inducted along with Dick, but his demands are promptly ignored. Damian is once again saved by Dick, with the assistance of Azrael, after a man named Amon tries to sacrifice him. Sasha, now dubbed Scarlet by Todd, returns and attacks Robin, as Jason attacks Dick, the two duos battle it out until the arrival of the Flamingo, who temporarily paralyzes Damian. Talia fixes Damian's spine, but puts in a monitor connected to his brain allowing her to control his every movement.\n\nAs Dick and Damian go through various events together, such as against the Black Mask, the Blackest Night and a rogue Batman clone-corpse, the two bond even more, prompting Talia to give over control of the monitor to [[Deathstroke]] who tries to use it to kill Dick. Working together, Dick and Damian manage to stop Deathstroke. As Dick cares little for the financial problems of Wayne Enterprises, despite inheriting it from Bruce along with Tim, Damian decides to involve himself and manages to impress the board of directors. While he does not file a lawsuit against Dick, due to Grayson not being named the heir of [[Wayne Enterprises]], but rather a high-ranking member, he does against Tim, who was named the heir to Wayne Enterprises.<ref>''Batman & Robin'' vol. 3 #10 (March 2010)</ref>\n\n===''Red Robin''===\nDamian's second year as Robin begins with a bang, as he chooses this time to pick a fight against his predecessor [[Tim Drake|Red Robin]]. Tim, who has been keeping a list of criminals and tasks he calls the Hit List, attracts Damian's fury when he hacks the Hit List and discovers a hidden layer of allies to the Bat-Family considered potential threats by Tim. Damian finds himself on this list. During a stakeout mission, Damian slices off Tim's line, causing him to fall from a great height. He survives, and Tim pulls Damian into an all-out brawl that begins with their quarry escaping, and ending in front of the theater where Bruce Wayne's parents were killed. The two are stopped by [[Dick Grayson|Batman]], who chastises them both for fighting in front of the theater where Batman was born. The two then enter into a grudging truce for the remainder of Damian's appearances in the series. Dick suggests changing the Hit List password to [[Cousin Oliver#Notable Recurring characters|Cousin Oliver]], as Damian has little to no interest in pop culture references and would never guess it. Dick noted that his name is not on the list and Tim asserts it's because Dick is the only one who Tim trusts implicitly.\n\n===''Blackest Night''===\n{{Main|Blackest Night}}\nAfter Bruce's skull was taken from his grave, Damian and Dick decide to bring the rest of his skeleton, along with those of Damian's paternal grandparents, to their base beneath Wayne Tower. Damian is quite shaken by the sight of the bones of his family. On the way to the cave, Dick's body is possessed by [[Deadman (DC Comics)|Deadman]], at whom Damian lashes out in confusion. Deadman then possesses and leaves Damian's body, subsequently passing his knowledge of the attack of the [[Black Lantern Corps|Black Lanterns]] onto him. The two heroes then prepare for the Black Lanterns' assault on Gotham.<ref>''Blackest Night: Batman'' #1 (August 2009)</ref> After raiding the Army Reserve National Guard Armory, Dick, Damian, and the arriving Tim Drake, are able to save Commissioner Gordon, Oracle, and the surviving police officers at Gotham Central from the reanimated versions of the original Dark Knight's deceased rogues gallery members. However, they then find themselves in a horrific encounter with the parents of Dick Grayson and Tim Drake reanimated as Black Lanterns.<ref>''Blackest Night: Batman'' #2 (November 2009)</ref> Dick and Tim send Damian with the Gordons to their underground base while they battle the Black Lanterns. Dick eventually orders Damian through their comm-links to send one of his Wingers with [[Mr. Freeze]]'s gun. Grayson uses the weapon to cryogenically suspend himself and Tim, forcing the Black Lanterns to retreat as they are unable to read any sign of life of them. Deadman later revives the former Boy Wonders.<ref>''Blackest Night: Batman'' #3 (December 2009)</ref>\n\n===Return of Bruce Wayne===\nTalia begins to clone Damian as she realizes that her son has completely sided with Dick Grayson and the Bat-Family. Damian finally stands up for his Robin mantle, telling Talia that being Robin was the best thing that he had ever done, and Talia does not need to save him from something he chooses to be. Talia then shows Damian a cloned version of himself, whom she sees as Damian's younger brother. Talia admits to Damian, that even though she loves him, she is too much of a perfectionist to admire him for choosing a path that defies her this blatantly, and he is therefore no longer welcome, and will be considered an enemy of the House of al Ghul. Damian defiantly replies that he hopes to be a worthy one. Damian (as Robin) is then seen teaming up with Dick and Alfred to begin their own search for Bruce Wayne.<ref>''Batman & Robin'' vol. 3 #12 (May 2010)</ref>\n\nDuring a confrontation with a returned minor villain the Getaway Genius, Damian is initially angry that Grayson failed to capture the foe \u2013 as well as the implication that his father failed as well during the Genius' original run back when Grayson was Robin \u2013 but when Dick explains to him that Bruce let the Genius go because he discovered that the Genius' robberies were only him stealing medicines that he needed so that he could live long enough to see his daughter grow up, Damian realises that he never really knew his father as a person, and admits that there was more to him than Batman.<ref>''Batman'' #703</ref>\n\nAfter Grayson's confidant Oberon Sexton is revealed to be the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]] in disguise, Damian tortures the villain by savagely beating him with a crowbar in order to get information, considering it to be self-defense since the Joker planned to attack him.<ref>''Batman & Robin'' vol. 3 #13 (2010)</ref> However, the Clown Prince of Crime's apparent helplessness is revealed to be another ruse and he incapacitates Damian with his hidden Joker venom. The villain intends to use Damian and Dick in his fight against their common enemies: the Black Glove. Help arrives in the form of the original Batman. After Bruce Wayne helps Dick and Damian defeat the Black Glove and the Joker, Wayne accepts his son in addition to his role as Robin.<ref>''Batman & Robin'' vol. 3 #16 (November 2010)</ref> Despite Bruce's parental responsibilities to Damian, he decides that he prefers Damian to continue working with Dick (who maintains the Batman mantle and whom Bruce sees as a positive role model for his son) rather than being with himself primarily, due to his plans with ''[[Batman Incorporated|Batman Inc.]]''<ref>''Batman: The Return'' one-shot (Jan. 2011)</ref>\n\n===Teen Titans===\nDamian joins the Teen Titans when Dick Grayson concludes that the team needs a Robin, while also feeling that Damian would benefit from the friendship of other heroes, having progressed to the point where he can be trusted not to kill if left 'unsupervised'.<ref>''Teen Titans'' vol. 3 #88</ref> Although Wonder Girl objects to this decision, Grayson convinces her to let Damian stay on the team as he needs Damian to learn that he can trust others not to betray him, only for his temper to jeopardize his first mission with the team when he attacks an opponent just after [[Raven (DC Comics)|Raven]] had convinced him to calm down, provoking their new foe into starting his wave of destruction again.<ref>''Teen Titans'' vol. 3 #89</ref> Robin eventually begins to develop a friendship with [[Rose Wilson|Ravager]], who initially reaches out to Damian due to their similar upbringings (Ravager's father being the notorious assassin, [[Deathstroke]]).<ref>''Teen Titans'' vol. 3 #91</ref> Tim Drake eventually comes to the Titans for help after a robotic duplicate of [[Calculator (comics)|the Calculator]] attempts to murder his close friend, [[Tamara Fox|Tam Fox]], and decides to rejoin the team once the mission is completed. Damian chooses to leave the team upon Drake's return, reasoning that the Teen Titans do not need two Robins, and realizing that his teammates prefer to work with Tim. Upon returning to Gotham, Damian tells Dick that even though he had been brought to the Titans in order to find friends, he did not need to, as he already had one, Grayson himself.<ref>''Teen Titans'' vol. 3 #92</ref>\n\nWhen [[Cassandra Cain|Blackbat]], [[Stephanie Brown (comics)|Stephanie Brown]]'s predecessor, returns to Gotham, she and Damian are partnered together during a stake-out to catch the Architect, a new villain obsessed with destroying Gotham landmarks. Damian berates Blackbat and mocks her for being sent to Hong Kong by his father, but she ultimately saves his life by rescuing him from the exploding [[Iceberg Lounge]].<ref>''Batman: Gates of Gotham''</ref> Afterwards, the two work together to stop the bomber from destroying a massive bridge, saving dozens of lives in the process.<ref>''Batman: Gates of Gotham'' #2</ref>\n\nRobin and a group of other ex-Titans later head to [[Titans Tower]] to help the team during a battle against [[Superboy-Prime]] and the [[Legion of Doom]].<ref>''Teen Titans'' vol. 3 #99</ref> During the battle, Robin destroys one of Prime's evil [[Match (DC Comics)|Superboy doppelg\u00e4ngers]] by using a [[Kryptonite]] blade.<ref>''Teen Titans'' vol. 3 #100</ref>\n\n===The New 52===\n[[File:Damian-Wayne-BRv25.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Damian Wayne in ''Batman and Robin'' vol. 2, #5 (March 2012). Art by Patrick Gleason.]]\nFollowing the \"[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]\" story arc, Bruce Wayne was returned by writers as being the only [[Batman]] in 2011's [[the New 52]] relaunch of DC Comics. [[Dick Grayson]] was returned to his previous role as [[Nightwing]], and Damian still serves as his father's vigilante partner [[Robin (comics)|Robin]]. After reading the letter written by his father from an alternate timeline, the Dark Knight decides that it is time to take steps to put his past behind him. He tries to teach Damian the same values his parents have instilled within him as he finally assumes his role as a father.<ref>''Batman and Robin'' vol. 2 #1 (September 2011)</ref> However, despite Bruce's attempts to build a relationship with his son, Damian remains distant from his father, which Alfred worries about. Although this relationship is further strained when Damian seemingly leaves Wayne Manor to join the villain [[Morgan Ducard|Nobody]], it turns out this was a ruse by Damian to bring down Nobody. Although Damian eventually kills Nobody in front of Bruce, they are able to work through the incident by beginning to actively understand and respect one another as father and son. Bruce goes so far as to conceal the event from Dick and Tim, leading Alfred to comment to Bruce that he has become \"quite the overprotective parent\".\n\nIn Batman-related issues of the New 52 taking place after Batman issue #14 ([[Joker (comics)|the Joker]]'s return to comics), Damian was portrayed as being very interested in fighting his father's arch foe. He seemed to always be eager to take on the Joker, and repeatedly assumes that bad things happening in Gotham are related to the Joker in some way, in hopeful anticipation of an encounter with him. In ''Batman and Robin'' vol. 2, #15, Damian defies his father's orders to remain in the [[Batcave]] and investigates Alfred's kidnapping. The investigation leads to Gotham Zoo where Damian is captured by Joker. Joker accuses Damian and the other members of Batman's family of being a burden that prevents Batman from being the best foe for Joker. Joker tells Damian that his and Batman's greatest fear is being responsible for the other's death. Joker then presents Damian with Batman in Joker makeup, and states that Damian must kill Batman before Batman kills him.{{sfn|Tomasi|February 2013}} Unwilling to kill his father, Damian chooses death, but the Joker kills Batman before he can deal a fatal blow. Damian passes out from [[Joker venom]] and Batman is revealed to be a fake; as Damian recovers from the toxin, the Joker presents him with a cloche. The Joker is eventually defeated by Batman, but the trust between Batman and the [[List of Batman supporting characters#Batman Family|Batman Family]] is shattered.\n\nDuring the \"Leviathan\" story arc, when his mother Talia puts a price on his head and is targeted by the most dangerous and skilled assassins, Bruce faked Damian's death and secluded him in the Batcave in order to protect him while he goes undercover to confront Talia and her minions. But against his father's wishes he escapes, donning a new costume under the name of Redbird.<ref>''Batman: Incorporated'' #3 (September 2012)</ref>\n\nAlong with the mysterious Wingman and most of the Bat-family, Damian manages to rescue his father and defeat most of the League of Shadows. However, Batman explains that the temporary defeat of the League will not stop a larger force to attack later and destroy the city, so he came to the extreme decision that the only solution possible is for Damian to return to his mother, a decision that caused an emotional reaction on Damian like never before.\n\n====Death====\nDamian is killed battling a brutal enemy, the Heretic (an adult Damian clone) in issue number 8 of the second volume of the ''[[Batman, Inc.]]'' comic book, which went on sale February 27, 2013. According to the story's writer, [[Grant Morrison]]: \"He saves the world. He does his job as Robin. He dies an absolute hero\".<ref>{{cite web|title=DC killing off Batman's 'Boy Wonder' Damian Wayne in new comic book|url=http://www.nypost.com/p/news/national/holy_hit_job_robin_eats_it_kZ9EWvYlw10mf4wS324GhN|work=New York Post|accessdate=February 27, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Batman's side-kick Robin to be killed off in next DC Comics issue|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-207_162-57571321/batmans-side-kick-robin-to-be-killed-off-in-next-dc-comics-issue/|publisher=CBS News|accessdate=February 27, 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn the comic, Damian is fighting hordes of [[Leviathan (DC Comics)|Leviathan]] henchmen in the lobby of Wayne Tower when Nightwing comes to rescue him. Behind cover, the two briefly reminisce about their time together as Batman and Robin before resuming the defense. When the Heretic arrives and knocks Nightwing out, Damian bravely fights him. However, the Heretic eventually gains the upper hand and impales Damian through the chest, the sword piercing Damian's heart and resulting in Damian dying almost instantly. Minutes after Damian's death, Batman arrives and sees Damian's dead body. Angered, he and a revived Nightwing battle the Heretic, but are eventually forced to retreat with Red Robin, and Damian's body. After holding a private funeral for the fallen Boy Wonder, Bruce vows to avenge his son's death.\n\nThe later storyline, ''Requiem'', deals with the aftermath of Damian's death and Batman's thirst for revenge against Talia as well as his own increasingly unbalanced mental state resulting from this loss. He is buried next to Bruce Wayne's parents, Damian's paternal grandparents. Batman is also unwilling to accept his son's death, and begins seeking the means to resurrect Damian at the cost of his relationships with his friends and allies, and keeps his death a secret from public in anticipation that his resurrection would succeed.<ref>''Batman and Robin'' vol. 4 #19 (April 2013)</ref><ref>''Batman and Robin'' vol. 4 #20 (May 2013)</ref> Damian's absence has also been causing a conflict between his father and his acting instructor, [[Carrie Kelley]], who is determined to find out what has happened to him, leading her to realize that the Waynes are harboring a secret.<ref>''Batman and Robin'' vol. 2 #19 (April 2013)</ref>\n\nWhen Batman and Nightwing finally re-confront Heretic, they overpower him, and the clone suffers a brutal beating from both in retaliation for Damian's death. Batman, despite desiring to kill his son's murderer more than anything and Nightwing making no attempts of stopping his mentor, spares the villain's life after seeing his resemblance to Damian, realizing the clone is what is left of his son. However, Talia later kills the Heretic for his failure to kill Batman, and challenges Batman to a duel to the death in the Batcave.<ref>''Batman, Incorporated'' vol. 2 #12 (July 2013)</ref> But Talia is killed following the duel by [[Batwoman (Kathy Kane)|Kathy Webb]], and it is later revealed that Damian's body was stolen from the Manor cemetery by the League of Assassins along with Talia's for plans against Batman in addition to make their resurrections. It has also been shown that Ra's al Ghul has begun to engineer more clones of Damian.<ref>''Batman, Incorporated'' vol. 2 #13 (August 2013)</ref>\n\n====Road to Resurrection====\nAfter being preoccupied with a series of cases in Gotham, Batman begins his attempt to reclaim Damian's body despite Ra's claim that he wishes to resurrect his daughter and grandson. Batman continues his pursuit out of his distrust towards Ra's. After defeating Damian's half-aquatic clones with [[Aquaman]], Batman seeks [[Wonder Woman]]'s help in chasing Ra's to [[Themyscira (DC Comics)|Themyscira]].<ref>''Batman and Aquaman'' vol. 2 #29 (March 2014)</ref> Though Ra's attempts to resurrect Damian alongside Talia in what he thought was a Lazarus Pit in the island in addition to brainwash his grandson into joining him afterwards, instead Ra's discovers that it is a portal to a Netherworld in the Pit's former location, of which both Wonder Woman and Batman were already aware. Ra's flees with the bodies afterwards.<ref>''Batman and Wonder Woman'' vol. 2 #30 (April 2014)</ref>\n\nAfter Batman and [[Frankenstein (DC Comics)|Frankenstein]] locate Ra's and the bodies, they are too late as Ra's has successfully had them placed in a Lazarus Pit, leaving Batman in dread of Damian's fate.<ref>''Batman and Frankenstein'' vol. 2 #31 (May 2014)</ref> The resurrections fail, leaving Ra's to realize his arrogance for allowing the Heretic to kill his grandson, and regret allowing Talia to clone Damian. After defeating Ra's in combat, Batman reclaims Damian's body and threatens his son's maternal grandfather that if he steals his son's body again, he will kill him in retaliation. They later encounter [[Darkseid]]'s elite member [[Glorious Godfrey]], setting in motion the ''Robin Rises'' story arc.<ref>''Batman and Ra's al Ghul'' vol. 2 #32 (June 2014)</ref>\n\n====Return====\nLater, Godfrey's reason for coming to Earth is revealed; to retrieve the Chaos Shard, a powerful crystal that once belonged to Darkseid which Ra's revealed was hidden inside the sarcophagus he crafted for Damian. After detecting a trace signature of the shard coming from inside Damian's body, Godfrey escapes with Damian's corpse back to Apokolips, despite assistance from the Justice League. Angered, Batman once again vows to retrieve his son's corpse.<ref>''Robin Rises: Omega'' one-shot (July 2014)</ref>\n\nBatman enters and accesses the Justice League Watchtower to use his unstable exosuit known as the Hellbat armor designed by Batman himself and the Justice League members to engage large scale threats.<ref>''Batman and Robin'' vol. 2 #33 (July 2014)</ref> He then activates the Boom Tube to Darkseid's homeworld, Apokolips, to retrieve Damian's corpse.<ref>''Batman and Robin'' vol. 2 #34 (August 2014)</ref> Batman successfully retrieves his son's corpse as he and his family team return to Earth via the Boom Tube directly to the Batcave after successfully escaping the clutches of Darkseid and his Parademons.

With Batman facing two choices of whether to resurrect Damian or his parents, he chooses his son, granting Damian's true resurrection. As Damian and Batman embrace, Batman collapses from exhaustion.<ref>''Batman and Robin'' vol. 2 #37 (December 2014)</ref>\n\nHowever, before the team can celebrate, the Boom Tube used to return to Earth was not closed and Darkseid's son Kalibak arrives and attacks the team. During the fight, Kalibak beats the team nearly to death, when suddenly Damian knocks out Kalibak with a powerful uppercut; discovering that due to the Chaos Shard he has gained superhuman abilities. While Damian fights Kalibak, Batman remotely controls the Batwing and sends it crashing into Kalibak, sending him back through the Boom Tube and then closes the portal. Damian then reunites with his father and his family team. In the aftermath, Damian is tested by Batman on how to control his new power abilities before Damian returns to the role as Robin.<ref>''Robin Rises: Alpha'' one-shot (December 2014)</ref> With help from the Justice League, Batman discovers that Damian's new powers do not last, and he eventually relies on his natural abilities once more.<ref>''Batman and Robin'' vol. 2 #40 (March 2015)</ref>\n\n[[File:Damian Wayne Rebirth.png|thumb|right|upright|Damian Wayne in [[DC Rebirth]]; art by Jim Lee, Scott Williams, and Lex Sinclair]]\n\n====''Robin: Son of Batman''====\nAfter the events of ''[[Batman: Endgame]]'' that resulted in Bruce Wayne's disappearance, Damian, as Robin, sets out on a globe-spanning journey to forge his own destiny and make amends for all of his wrongdoings in his own series, titled ''Robin: Son of Batman''. Along his journey, he crosses paths with Ra's and Talia al Ghul, Deathstroke, and a new character named Maya Ducard, daughter of the late villain, NoBody. Damian plays a particular role in ''[[Batman and Robin Eternal]]'' when the Bat-Family is pitted against Mother, a ruthless woman who believes that she can make her 'children' stronger by putting them through intense trauma. Returning to assist his fellow Robins as the crisis reaches its conclusion, Damian helps Dick, Jason and Tim regain confidence in themselves after Mother decimates their initial efforts against her by recalling a conversation he had with Bruce where Bruce noted that he is proud of how all three of the other Robins have different strengths, Bruce wanting his partners to find their own paths rather than blindly follow his own example.<ref>''Batman & Robin Eternal'' #22</ref>\n\nDamian is also a major player in the ''[[Robin War]]'' event, where he, Agent 37 (Dick Grayson), Red Hood, and Red Robin organize a street gang called \"Robins\" to defeat the Court of Owls with reluctant aid from Jim Gordon, who is now Batman. In the climax, the Court manipulates Damian into joining them so they can use him to recruit Agent 37. Dick does join in order to save Damian and end the war. In the aftermath, Robin forms an unlikely partnership with his mother Talia.\n\n===DC Rebirth===\n{{Update|date=August 2017}}\nAs part of the [[DC Rebirth]], Damian is featured in three titles: ''Teen Titans'', where he becomes the team's leader in order to defeat Ra's al Ghul and succeed Red Robin (Tim Drake) as leader, ''Super Sons'', co-starring with [[Jonathan Samuel Kent|Jon Kent]], the son of Superman and the new Superboy and ''Nightwing'', where he will have a supporting role.\n===Teen Titans Rebirth===\nOn his 13th birthday Damian is sent a package by his grandfather Ra's al Ghul, which contains a dead robin. After a meeting with his mother Talia, he discovers that it is a warning from his cousin Mara al Ghul, who has chosen him as her prey as part of an initiation ritual that she must undertake in order to properly join the League of Assassins. Mara has been made leader of a group known as the Demon's Fist, which was originally supposed to be led by Damian, but became hers when he chose to leave the League. They, too, have chosen targets that they must hunt down in order to ascend to the League. Damian decides to collect the other Demon's Fist's targets in order to form the new Teen Titans; this includes [[Starfire (Koriand'r)|Starfire]], [[Beast Boy]], [[Raven (DC Comics)|Raven]] and [[Wally West II|Kid Flash]].\n\nAfter the events of ''Justice League: No Justice'', the Titans disband. In his subsequent struggle with organized crime in Gotham and a mysterious crime lord known as The Other, Damian assembles a new team of Titans, consisting of Kid Flash (the only old team member to join), Kid Flash's friend and kid genius Roundhouse, [[Emiko Queen|Red Arrow]], [[Lobo (DC Comics)|Lobo's]] daughter Crush, and the immortal [[Jinn|spirit creature]] Djinn.<ref>''Teen Titans Special'' #1 (2018), ''Teen Titans'' #20 (July 2018)</ref> This new team faces initial difficulties because of Red Arrow's criticism and the individualistic tendencies of several members. During a case in which [[Gizmo (DC Comics)|Gizmo]] nearly detonates a nuclear device, Robin uses the ring to which Djinn is bound to grant her the use of her full powers to avert the crisis, and returns it afterwards, refusing to assume mastery over her. This earns him Djinn's trust, which gradually begins to turn into a mutual romantic attraction.<ref>''Teen Titans'' #21 (August 2018)</ref> However, what Damian does not tell his teammates is that a deep cellar of the Titans' headquarters, a former juvenile detention facility, serves him as a secret dungeon to lock away the most dangerous criminals he captures for good, including [[Deathstroke]], Gizmo, [[Brother Blood]], [[Black Mask (comics)|Black Mask]], and [[Atomic Skull#Joseph Martin|Atomic Skull]].<ref>''Teen Titans'' #20 (July 2018)</ref> \n\nHis teammates are also unaware that he is working with [[Jason Todd]], who goes by the alias Outlaw<ref>Lobdell, Scott (w), Woods, Pete (a), Peteri, Troy (let), Marie Javins, Rob Levin (ed). \"Outlaw, Part One\" ''Red Hood and the Outlaws'' 26 (November, 2018), New York: DC Comics</ref>. Due to a miscommunication, Damian can no longer trust him, which ultimately leads them to cut ties.\n\nEventually, Kid Flash discovers the secret prison,<ref>''Teen Titans'' #28 (March 2019)</ref> and Crush, who [[LGBT themes in comics|has fallen for Djinn]], kisses her, showing her the kind of genuine affection which Damian in his grimness never really did.<ref>''Teen Titans'' #29 (April 2019)</ref> When the other Titans find out, and when Red Arrow kills Deathstroke,<ref>''Deathstroke'' #43</ref> conflict erupts within the team until [[Lobo (DC Comics)|Lobo]], looking for Crush, crashes in.<ref>''Teen Titans'' #30-32 (May-July 2019)</ref> Djinn defeats him by altering his memory, and proceeds to do so with the other criminals Damian captures, giving them new, harmless identities.<ref>''Teen Titans'' #33 (August 2019)</ref>\n\n===Super Sons===\nIn this book Robin is teamed up with Superman's son Jonathan Kent. Together they team and become the Super Sons. In the first volume Damian and Jon team up to defeat Kid Amazo. Kid Amazo was a person affected by the Amazo virus a virus that grants humans powers. They defeat him and Damian decides to train Jon. Batman gives them an underwater base which later gets destroyed. Currently the team is over due to changes made to Jon's character.<ref>Superman #8 (2018)</ref>\n\n==Skills and Abilities==\nHaving been trained by the [[League of Assassins]] since birth, Damian is already an expert in martial arts and in wielding a wide range of weaponry. Despite his age, Damian has taken on and bested trained fighters like Talia Al Ghul, Red Hood (Jason Todd), Red Robin (Tim Drake), and the Joker, amongst others. He was also trained in the disciplines of forensics, acrobatics, criminology, disguise and escapology. Damian is skilled in mimicking voices and speech patterns of others accurately, as he was able to imitate his father's and Tim Drake's voices in order to bypass the Batcave's voice-recognition security systems.<ref name=\"Batman #658\"/> Damian is shown to have highly advanced engineering skills, as he was able to complete his father's plans of building a flying Batmobile, the construction of which Alfred described as \"being an endless source of frustration to Damian's father\". Damian is also a capable businessman despite his young age, being involved with [[Wayne Enterprises]] and its board members. He also has been trained in numerous weapons as shown in the ''Blackest Night'' event.<ref>''Batman: Blackest Night'' vol 1 #2</ref> Damian possessed superpowers similar to that of Superman following his resurrection, though this was short-lived. However, he is shown to possess healing abilities and powers in the future.\n\n==Appearance==\n[[File:Robin (Damian Wayne).jpg|thumb|upright|Damian Wayne on the cover of ''Batman and Robin'' #1 (August 2009). Art by J.G. Jones.]]\nAfter stealing [[Jason Todd]]'s Robin tunic and mask from his memorial case, Damian's unofficial appearance as Robin was wearing them over his black and white League of Assassins bodysuit with a grayish hood and cape. He carried a pair of [[brass knuckles]], which he incorporated as part of this costume, and would also carry a sword.\n\nAfter Dick Grayson officially sanctioned Damian's role as Robin, while a standard Robin tunic was retained, the bodysuit was replaced with a black survival suit, the grayish cape with a yellow \"para-cape\" which grants him a [[gliding]] capability, the black mask with a green one, a bulkier utility belt to carry more arsenal and gadgetry, a black hood, and flexible green gloves and boots.\n\nAs of age 13, Damian was short for his age and had few other markers of impending puberty, in [[Super-Sons|Super Sons]] it was a running joke that he was frequently mistaken as younger than ten-year-old [[Jonathan Samuel Kent|Jonathan Kent]].\n\n==Other versions==\n{{Further|Alternate versions of Robin}}\nReferences in current continuity have been made to the future of Bruce and Talia's son.\n\n* In ''[[DC One Million]]'' (1999), written by Grant Morrison, a Batman from the 853rd Century references a Dark Knight's battle with Two-Face-Two, which ''Batman'' #700 (2010) depicts with Damian Wayne.<ref>''Batman'' #700</ref>\n* In ''[[Teen Titans]]'' vol. 3 #18 (2006), when the Teen Titans were transported 10 years into the future, a graveyard full of deceased Batman allies and villains is depicted.

This version is a stark departure from his original counterpart: his father remains [[Batman]] (Bruce Wayne) but his mother is [[Catwoman]] (Selina Kyle), bears no intent to kill at all and acts much more like his father and his costume is similar to [[Tim Drake]]'s second Robin costume. Initially portrayed as being reluctant to follow in his father's footsteps, he tells his parents that he does not want them to plot out his own life for him. But after his parents are killed by [[Joker (character)|Joker Jr.]], Damian takes up the Robin mantle and fights alongside [[Dick Grayson|Batman]] (Dick Grayson). Ultimately, the two bring Joker Jr. and the original Joker to justice and save Gotham from a poison gas attack. It shows that Damian goes on to fight the Club of Villains, Flamingo and [[Professor Pyg]]. The episode ends with Dick passing on the Batman mantle to Damian, who is then shown fighting crime with his own child (voiced by Sebastian Bader) as the new Robin. The pair are seen fighting the mutants from ''[[The Dark Knight Returns]]'', a reference which is further established by the new Robin's resemblance to the Robin ([[Carrie Kelley]]) from that comic. It ultimately turns out that the episode's events were part of [[Alfred Pennyworth]]'s book 'The Knights of Tomorrow'. This episode was based on a comic book story from the [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]] in which Batman was married to [[Batwoman|Kathy Kane]] with their son [[Alternate versions of Robin|Bruce Wayne Jr.]]<ref>''Batman'' #131</ref>\n* The character is referenced in the ''[[Teen Titans Go! (TV series)|Teen Titans Go!]]'' animated series. In the episode \"Yearbook Madness\", Damian's name appears in Starfire's yearbook, saying to call him if things with [[Robin (comics)|Robin]] don't work out.\n* Damian appears in season five of ''[[DC Super Hero Girls]]'', voiced by [[Grey Griffin]]. He is seen in the episode \"Kid Napped\". \n* Damian Wayne makes his debut appearance, as cameo, in ''[[Young Justice: Outsiders]]'' episode \"Rescue Op\" as a newborn, held by his mother [[Talia al Ghul]]. This implies that he was born in the two-year time gap between this season and the previous ''Invasion'' season, that Batman and Talia had had their affair during that time.\n* Damian makes his web television debut as the current Robin in the adult animated series ''[[Harley Quinn (TV series)|Harley Quinn]]'', voiced by [[Jacob Tremblay]].<ref>https://deadline.com/2019/07/harley-quinn-dc-universe-kaley-cuoco-tca-patrick-schumacker-1202651411/</ref> He is portrayed as a spoiled brat whom most characters don't take seriously. In \"Finding Mr. Right\", in an effort to improve his reputation, he appears on a talk show and lies that [[Harley Quinn]] agreed to be his arch-enemy. Offended, Harley kidnaps him and dangles him over a tank with [[King Shark]] in it. When he confesses he lied, Harley reveals the talk show audience behind a curtain, humiliating him. King Shark goes berserk when he smells blood and nearly kills him, but his father Batman rescues him. The Joker then kidnaps him and Batman saves him again. Batman comforts him and says he can wait until he is ready for his own nemesis. In the season two premiere, \"New Gotham\", Damian took up the mantle of Batman after he disappeared in the chaos caused by Joker's destruction of Gotham during the season one finale despite not being old enough to do so.\n\n===Film===\n* Damian Wayne has a major role in ''[[Son of Batman]]'', voiced by [[Stuart Allan]].\n* Damian Wayne also appears in ''[[Batman vs. Robin]]'' as a sequel to ''Son of Batman'', with Stuart Allan reprising his role.\n* Damian Wayne appears in ''[[Batman: Bad Blood]]'', a sequel to ''Son of Batman'' and ''Batman vs. Robin'', with Stuart Allan reprising his role.

''Brotherhood of the Bat'' features a future in which Ra's al Ghul discovers the Batcave following [[Bruce Wayne]]'s death, and outfits the League of Assassins in variant Batman costumes based on [[Batman: Knight Gallery|Wayne's rejected designs]].

He was eventually recruited by [[Rip Hunter]] to try to stop a madman named [[Gog (DC Comics)|Gog]] from altering his history. He works with several other heroes of his generation \u2013 [[Kid Flash (Iris West)|Kid Flash]], the daughter of the [[Flash (comics)|Flash]] ([[Wally West]]); Nightstar and [[Offspring (comics)|Offspring]], the son of [[Plastic Man]].\n\nIn ''League of Batmen'' (2001), the sequel to ''Brotherhood of the Bat'', Tallant leads his own team of variant Batmen to combat the plague that was al Ghul's legacy.

In Morrison's version, the child Damian Wayne is the result of a tryst between Batman and Talia, during which the Dark Knight claims he was drugged when they were at the [[Tropic of Cancer]], though Morrison later admitted the claim of drugging was a canonical error on his part.

Art by [[Andy Kubert]].]]\nDamian's origin is unknown to Batman. Genetically perfected and grown in an artificial womb, Damian was intended to be a formidable warrior. He is raised by his mother [[Talia al Ghul]] and the [[League of Assassins]]. He becomes a talented martial artist before his teenage years, at which time Talia reveals Damian's existence to Bruce Wayne and leaves him in Batman's custody in an effort to disrupt Batman's work.\n\nPrecocious, spoiled, and violent, Damian battles [[Tim Drake]], whom he wants to replace as [[Robin (comics)|Robin]], and sucker punches Tim off the stuffed [[Tyrannosaurus]] in the [[Batcave]] when Tim stops fighting to help him. Damian then escapes, dons a variant Robin costume made of [[Jason Todd]]'s old tunic and mask and assorted League of Assassin gear, and gets into a fight with and decapitates the villainous Spook. Although misguided, Damian seems to genuinely want to aid Bruce's war on crime as he is Bruce's son and wants his approval. Unfortunately, because of how he was raised, Damian lacks any sort of common sense in regards to social behavior, and believes that in order to be accepted by his father, he must kill any rivals, which included Tim Drake. This troubles his relationship with Batman, who vows never to kill. However, because of his possible paternity to Damian, Batman, on some levels, is optimistic by the chance of fatherhood. \n\nEventually, Batman confronts Talia to confirm Damian's true identity, but both Talia and Damian are soon caught in an explosion. They survive the explosion. However, Damian's badly injured body requires transplants of harvested organs, which his mother orders her physicians to carry out. Damian makes a full recovery.<ref>''Batman'' #665</ref>\n\n===''The Resurrection of Ra's al Ghul''===\n{{Main|Batman: The Resurrection of Ra's al Ghul}}\nBeginning in ''Batman Annual #26 (\"Head of the Demon\")'', Talia takes Damian to the Australian [[Outback]], where he is tutored in the secret history of his grandfather Ra's al Ghul. Talia is unaware that a former servant of Ra's, named White Ghost, plans to use Damian as a shell for the soul of Ra's to return to Earth. This process would, of course, kill Damian. Talia is able to save her son from his fate at the last minute.\n\nRa's is still able to return, but as a rotting, shambling undead corpse, still needing Damian to stabilize his form. Damian flees to alert Batman, but is pursued by his evil grandfather. Upon entering [[Wayne Manor]], Damian attempts to relay to ([[Tim Drake]]) the fact that Ra's has returned. Tim, suspicious of Damian's intentions, does not believe his story and begins a fist fight. Damian flees and encounters Alfred. Before he can effectively relay his news, he is attacked by Tim, who perceives Damian's attempt to help a tripping Alfred as an attack, and renews their battle. As they fight, members of the League of Assassins approach the manor with the intention of killing all others within and bringing Damian back to Ra's alive. Damian and Tim fight side-by-side against Ra's and his minions. Their collaboration is hindered by their very different philosophies of battle. Damian is willing to betray Tim at any moment for his own safety. Ra's captures the two and tells Batman that he will use one of them for his own body. Batman offers his own body instead.\n\nRa's refuses the offer, feeling that he needs someone of a younger age. The choices are Tim or Damian. Batman offers a third alternative: \"Fountain of Essence\" which contains the qualities of a [[Lazarus Pit]]. Batman and Ra's go in search of the fountain, leaving Tim, Damian, [[Nightwing]], [[Alfred Pennyworth]] and Talia to battle the [[Sensei (DC Comics)|Sensei]]. Damian leaves his mother and Tim to an unknown fate, while he goes off to be with his father. He ends up captured by Ra's and nearly loses his life. Batman and the others manage to save him, and Talia takes her son and escapes.\n\nA subsequent conversation between Tim and Alfred implies that Batman has carried out a DNA test on Damian. Alfred says Bruce intended to tell him the results when the time was right. At this, Tim realizes that Damian is indeed Bruce's son, and exclaims \"The son of Satan is my brother?\"<ref>\"Did he do a paternity test on Damian? You know, like a DNA test... He had to, right? Alfred? -Tim Drake \"He insisted he would tell you the results himself when the time was right.\" -Alfred \"So you know. You both know and nobody is going to tell me?\" -Tim Drake \"It's not my place to say, young sir. Forgive me.\" -Alfred \"The son of Satan is my brother?\" -Tim Drake. Dialogue post-midway through comic book (\"son of Satan\" likely in reference to ''The Omen'' franchise). \"Morrison, Grant. ''Batman #676''.

In response to this, Talia begins formulating a plan involving Commissioner [[James Gordon (comics)|James Gordon]], whom Talia and Damian rescue from a booby-trapped Wayne Manor while in search of Batman, who is insane and has gone missing.\n\nDamian and Alfred race to aid Batman against the Black Glove in a commandeered [[Batmobile]]. Damian, who is driving, knocks an ambulance off a bridge without any sign of remorse or even concern. When Alfred reprimands him, Damian retorts with a backhanded threat. The only occupant of the ambulance was the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]].\n\n===''Battle for the Cowl''===\n{{Main|Batman: Battle for the Cowl}}\nIn ''Nightwing'' #153 (2009), Damian is shown being left in the care of [[Alfred Pennyworth]] and trained by [[Dick Grayson]] (alias Nightwing).\n\nUpon the start of ''Batman: Battle for the Cowl'', it appears that Damian is now residing in Gotham, and living under the command of Nightwing (to an extent). Where before Damian portrayed an arrogant and vicious personality, it appears the \"death\" of his father has regressed him to a more childlike mindset, as demonstrated when he takes the Batmobile joy-riding with an older girl. This is discovered by [[Barbara Gordon|Oracle]], who ejects the girl and takes control of the Batmobile, intent on taking Damian home. The car is blindsided by [[Killer Croc]] and [[Poison Ivy (comics)|Poison Ivy]], who prepare to kill Damian. The older girl (Damian's companion) is later eaten by Killer Croc.<ref>''Batman: Battle for the Cowl'' #1 (2009)</ref> Damian is saved by Nightwing who ends up being cornered by [[Black Mask (comics)|Black Mask]]'s men, until a murderous figure appears stating that he is Batman (later revealed to be Jason Todd). Although shot by Todd, Damian recovers and saves Tim Drake from falling to death inside Jason's Batcave.<ref>''Batman: Battle for the Cowl'' #2 (2009)</ref> When Grayson hangs up his Nightwing mantle to become the newest Batman, he chooses Damian to assume the mantle of Robin by his side.<ref>''Batman: Battle for the Cowl'' #3 (2009)</ref>\n\n===''Batman: Reborn''===\n{{Main|Batman: Reborn}}\nDespite becoming Robin to Grayson's Batman, Damian reveals that he cares little for his older brother and has no respect for him as Batman and that the latter would have to earn it. In an act of defiance, Damian decides to make the Robin mantle independent from that of Batman and decides to stop [[Doctor Phosphorus|Dr. Phosphorus]] from breaking into [[Project Cadmus]], but fails miserably and is saved by Dick. Dick then begins to train Damian as to how to properly become the new Robin and the two develop their own unique crime fighting style. Damian then begins to mock Tim Drake for not being chosen as Robin, causing Tim to severely beat Damian, only to be stopped by Dick.\n\nAfter Tim leaves, Damian starts engaging in chess games with [[Hush (comics)|Hush]], visiting him secretly against Dick's orders. When Elliot asked why Damian is visiting him behind the Bat-family's back, Damian shrugs it off as a desire to keep Elliot company. Elliot surmises that Damian is rather using the resemblance to Bruce to \"spend time with [his] old man\". Dick and Damian then encounter a villain called [[Professor Pyg]], who has created an army called Dollotrons. Dick and Damian take the entire army down and begin to form a brotherly relationship. Damian blames himself for being unable to save a single Dollotron, a girl named Sasha, but unbeknownst to him, the girl is taken in by Jason Todd, who had shot Damian,<ref>''Batman & Robin'' vol.3 #3 (2009)</ref> thereby becoming the new Robin's opposite number in Red Hood's no-holds-barred war against crime (Red Hood's maxim is \"let the punishment fit the crime\").<ref>''Batman & Robin'' vol. 3 #4 (2009)</ref>\n\nDamian and Dick then attack Firefly, who is attempting to kill Black Mask. Victor Zsasz defeats Robin and rescues Black Mask while Dick takes down Firefly. These events cause Hush to escape, causing Damian to grow a further hatred for the criminal. Damian is present when Dick is inducted into the JLA, upon hearing, Damian demands to be inducted along with Dick, but his demands are promptly ignored. Damian is once again saved by Dick, with the assistance of Azrael, after a man named Amon tries to sacrifice him. Sasha, now dubbed Scarlet by Todd, returns and attacks Robin, as Jason attacks Dick, the two duos battle it out until the arrival of the Flamingo, who temporarily paralyzes Damian. Talia fixes Damian's spine, but puts in a monitor connected to his brain allowing her to control his every movement.\n\nAs Dick and Damian go through various events together, such as against the Black Mask, the Blackest Night and a rogue Batman clone-corpse, the two bond even more, prompting Talia to give over control of the monitor to [[Deathstroke]] who tries to use it to kill Dick. Working together, Dick and Damian manage to stop Deathstroke. As Dick cares little for the financial problems of Wayne Enterprises, despite inheriting it from Bruce along with Tim, Damian decides to involve himself and manages to impress the board of directors. While he does not file a lawsuit against Dick, due to Grayson not being named the heir of [[Wayne Enterprises]], but rather a high-ranking member, he does against Tim, who was named the heir to Wayne Enterprises.<ref>''Batman & Robin'' vol. 3 #10 (March 2010)</ref>\n\n===''Red Robin''===\nDamian's second year as Robin begins with a bang, as he chooses this time to pick a fight against his predecessor [[Tim Drake|Red Robin]]. Tim, who has been keeping a list of criminals and tasks he calls the Hit List, attracts Damian's fury when he hacks the Hit List and discovers a hidden layer of allies to the Bat-Family considered potential threats by Tim. Damian finds himself on this list. During a stakeout mission, Damian slices off Tim's line, causing him to fall from a great height. He survives, and Tim pulls Damian into an all-out brawl that begins with their quarry escaping, and ending in front of the theater where Bruce Wayne's parents were killed. The two are stopped by [[Dick Grayson|Batman]], who chastises them both for fighting in front of the theater where Batman was born. The two then enter into a grudging truce for the remainder of Damian's appearances in the series. Dick suggests changing the Hit List password to [[Cousin Oliver#Notable Recurring characters|Cousin Oliver]], as Damian has little to no interest in pop culture references and would never guess it. Dick noted that his name is not on the list and Tim asserts it's because Dick is the only one who Tim trusts implicitly.\n\n===''Blackest Night''===\n{{Main|Blackest Night}}\nAfter Bruce's skull was taken from his grave, Damian and Dick decide to bring the rest of his skeleton, along with those of Damian's paternal grandparents, to their base beneath Wayne Tower. Damian is quite shaken by the sight of the bones of his family. On the way to the cave, Dick's body is possessed by [[Deadman (DC Comics)|Deadman]], at whom Damian lashes out in confusion. Deadman then possesses and leaves Damian's body, subsequently passing his knowledge of the attack of the [[Black Lantern Corps|Black Lanterns]] onto him. The two heroes then prepare for the Black Lanterns' assault on Gotham.<ref>''Blackest Night: Batman'' #1 (August 2009)</ref> After raiding the Army Reserve National Guard Armory, Dick, Damian, and the arriving Tim Drake, are able to save Commissioner Gordon, Oracle, and the surviving police officers at Gotham Central from the reanimated versions of the original Dark Knight's deceased rogues gallery members. However, they then find themselves in a horrific encounter with the parents of Dick Grayson and Tim Drake reanimated as Black Lanterns.<ref>''Blackest Night: Batman'' #2 (November 2009)</ref> Dick and Tim send Damian with the Gordons to their underground base while they battle the Black Lanterns. Dick eventually orders Damian through their comm-links to send one of his Wingers with [[Mr. Freeze]]'s gun. Grayson uses the weapon to cryogenically suspend himself and Tim, forcing the Black Lanterns to retreat as they are unable to read any sign of life of them. Deadman later revives the former Boy Wonders.<ref>''Blackest Night: Batman'' #3 (December 2009)</ref>\n\n===Return of Bruce Wayne===\nTalia begins to clone Damian as she realizes that her son has completely sided with Dick Grayson and the Bat-Family. Damian finally stands up for his Robin mantle, telling Talia that being Robin was the best thing that he had ever done, and Talia does not need to save him from something he chooses to be. Talia then shows Damian a cloned version of himself, whom she sees as Damian's younger brother. Talia admits to Damian, that even though she loves him, she is too much of a perfectionist to admire him for choosing a path that defies her this blatantly, and he is therefore no longer welcome, and will be considered an enemy of the House of al Ghul. Damian defiantly replies that he hopes to be a worthy one. Damian (as Robin) is then seen teaming up with Dick and Alfred to begin their own search for Bruce Wayne.<ref>''Batman & Robin'' vol. 3 #12 (May 2010)</ref>\n\nDuring a confrontation with a returned minor villain the Getaway Genius, Damian is initially angry that Grayson failed to capture the foe \u2013 as well as the implication that his father failed as well during the Genius' original run back when Grayson was Robin \u2013 but when Dick explains to him that Bruce let the Genius go because he discovered that the Genius' robberies were only him stealing medicines that he needed so that he could live long enough to see his daughter grow up, Damian realises that he never really knew his father as a person, and admits that there was more to him than Batman.<ref>''Batman'' #703</ref>\n\nAfter Grayson's confidant Oberon Sexton is revealed to be the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]] in disguise, Damian tortures the villain by savagely beating him with a crowbar in order to get information, considering it to be self-defense since the Joker planned to attack him.<ref>''Batman & Robin'' vol. 3 #13 (2010)</ref> However, the Clown Prince of Crime's apparent helplessness is revealed to be another ruse and he incapacitates Damian with his hidden Joker venom. The villain intends to use Damian and Dick in his fight against their common enemies: the Black Glove. Help arrives in the form of the original Batman. After Bruce Wayne helps Dick and Damian defeat the Black Glove and the Joker, Wayne accepts his son in addition to his role as Robin.<ref>''Batman & Robin'' vol. 3 #16 (November 2010)</ref> Despite Bruce's parental responsibilities to Damian, he decides that he prefers Damian to continue working with Dick (who maintains the Batman mantle and whom Bruce sees as a positive role model for his son) rather than being with himself primarily, due to his plans with ''[[Batman Incorporated|Batman Inc.]]''<ref>''Batman: The Return'' one-shot (Jan. 2011)</ref>\n\n===Teen Titans===\nDamian joins the Teen Titans when Dick Grayson concludes that the team needs a Robin, while also feeling that Damian would benefit from the friendship of other heroes, having progressed to the point where he can be trusted not to kill if left 'unsupervised'.<ref>''Teen Titans'' vol. 3 #88</ref> Although Wonder Girl objects to this decision, Grayson convinces her to let Damian stay on the team as he needs Damian to learn that he can trust others not to betray him, only for his temper to jeopardize his first mission with the team when he attacks an opponent just after [[Raven (DC Comics)|Raven]] had convinced him to calm down, provoking their new foe into starting his wave of destruction again.<ref>''Teen Titans'' vol. 3 #89</ref> Robin eventually begins to develop a friendship with [[Rose Wilson|Ravager]], who initially reaches out to Damian due to their similar upbringings (Ravager's father being the notorious assassin, [[Deathstroke]]).<ref>''Teen Titans'' vol. 3 #91</ref> Tim Drake eventually comes to the Titans for help after a robotic duplicate of [[Calculator (comics)|the Calculator]] attempts to murder his close friend, [[Tamara Fox|Tam Fox]], and decides to rejoin the team once the mission is completed. Damian chooses to leave the team upon Drake's return, reasoning that the Teen Titans do not need two Robins, and realizing that his teammates prefer to work with Tim. Upon returning to Gotham, Damian tells Dick that even though he had been brought to the Titans in order to find friends, he did not need to, as he already had one, Grayson himself.<ref>''Teen Titans'' vol. 3 #92</ref>\n\nWhen [[Cassandra Cain|Blackbat]], [[Stephanie Brown (comics)|Stephanie Brown]]'s predecessor, returns to Gotham, she and Damian are partnered together during a stake-out to catch the Architect, a new villain obsessed with destroying Gotham landmarks.

Art by Patrick Gleason.]]\nFollowing the \"[[Flashpoint (comics)|Flashpoint]]\" story arc, Bruce Wayne was returned by writers as being the only [[Batman]] in 2011's [[the New 52]] relaunch of DC Comics. [[Dick Grayson]] was returned to his previous role as [[Nightwing]], and Damian still serves as his father's vigilante partner [[Robin (comics)|Robin]]. After reading the letter written by his father from an alternate timeline, the Dark Knight decides that it is time to take steps to put his past behind him. He tries to teach Damian the same values his parents have instilled within him as he finally assumes his role as a father.<ref>''Batman and Robin'' vol. 2 #1 (September 2011)</ref> However, despite Bruce's attempts to build a relationship with his son, Damian remains distant from his father, which Alfred worries about. Although this relationship is further strained when Damian seemingly leaves Wayne Manor to join the villain [[Morgan Ducard|Nobody]], it turns out this was a ruse by Damian to bring down Nobody. Although Damian eventually kills Nobody in front of Bruce, they are able to work through the incident by beginning to actively understand and respect one another as father and son. Bruce goes so far as to conceal the event from Dick and Tim, leading Alfred to comment to Bruce that he has become \"quite the overprotective parent\".\n\nIn Batman-related issues of the New 52 taking place after Batman issue #14 ([[Joker (comics)|the Joker]]'s return to comics), Damian was portrayed as being very interested in fighting his father's arch foe. He seemed to always be eager to take on the Joker, and repeatedly assumes that bad things happening in Gotham are related to the Joker in some way, in hopeful anticipation of an encounter with him. In ''Batman and Robin'' vol. 2, #15, Damian defies his father's orders to remain in the [[Batcave]] and investigates Alfred's kidnapping. The investigation leads to Gotham Zoo where Damian is captured by Joker. Joker accuses Damian and the other members of Batman's family of being a burden that prevents Batman from being the best foe for Joker. Joker tells Damian that his and Batman's greatest fear is being responsible for the other's death. Joker then presents Damian with Batman in Joker makeup, and states that Damian must kill Batman before Batman kills him.{{sfn|Tomasi|February 2013}} Unwilling to kill his father, Damian chooses death, but the Joker kills Batman before he can deal a fatal blow. Damian passes out from [[Joker venom]] and Batman is revealed to be a fake; as Damian recovers from the toxin, the Joker presents him with a cloche. The Joker is eventually defeated by Batman, but the trust between Batman and the [[List of Batman supporting characters#Batman Family|Batman Family]] is shattered.\n\nDuring the \"Leviathan\" story arc, when his mother Talia puts a price on his head and is targeted by the most dangerous and skilled assassins, Bruce faked Damian's death and secluded him in the Batcave in order to protect him while he goes undercover to confront Talia and her minions. But against his father's wishes he escapes, donning a new costume under the name of Redbird.<ref>''Batman: Incorporated'' #3 (September 2012)</ref>\n\nAlong with the mysterious Wingman and most of the Bat-family, Damian manages to rescue his father and defeat most of the League of Shadows. However, Batman explains that the temporary defeat of the League will not stop a larger force to attack later and destroy the city, so he came to the extreme decision that the only solution possible is for Damian to return to his mother, a decision that caused an emotional reaction on Damian like never before.\n\n====Death====\nDamian is killed battling a brutal enemy, the Heretic (an adult Damian clone) in issue number 8 of the second volume of the ''[[Batman, Inc.]]'' comic book, which went on sale February 27, 2013.

Behind cover, the two briefly reminisce about their time together as Batman and Robin before resuming the defense. When the Heretic arrives and knocks Nightwing out, Damian bravely fights him. However, the Heretic eventually gains the upper hand and impales Damian through the chest, the sword piercing Damian's heart and resulting in Damian dying almost instantly. Minutes after Damian's death, Batman arrives and sees Damian's dead body. Angered, he and a revived Nightwing battle the Heretic, but are eventually forced to retreat with Red Robin, and Damian's body. After holding a private funeral for the fallen Boy Wonder, Bruce vows to avenge his son's death.\n\nThe later storyline, ''Requiem'', deals with the aftermath of Damian's death and Batman's thirst for revenge against Talia as well as his own increasingly unbalanced mental state resulting from this loss. He is buried next to Bruce Wayne's parents, Damian's paternal grandparents. Batman is also unwilling to accept his son's death, and begins seeking the means to resurrect Damian at the cost of his relationships with his friends and allies, and keeps his death a secret from public in anticipation that his resurrection would succeed.<ref>''Batman and Robin'' vol. 4 #19 (April 2013)</ref><ref>''Batman and Robin'' vol. 4 #20 (May 2013)</ref> Damian's absence has also been causing a conflict between his father and his acting instructor, [[Carrie Kelley]], who is determined to find out what has happened to him, leading her to realize that the Waynes are harboring a secret.<ref>''Batman and Robin'' vol. 2 #19 (April 2013)</ref>\n\nWhen Batman and Nightwing finally re-confront Heretic, they overpower him, and the clone suffers a brutal beating from both in retaliation for Damian's death. Batman, despite desiring to kill his son's murderer more than anything and Nightwing making no attempts of stopping his mentor, spares the villain's life after seeing his resemblance to Damian, realizing the clone is what is left of his son. However, Talia later kills the Heretic for his failure to kill Batman, and challenges Batman to a duel to the death in the Batcave.<ref>''Batman, Incorporated'' vol. 2 #12 (July 2013)</ref> But Talia is killed following the duel by [[Batwoman (Kathy Kane)|Kathy Webb]], and it is later revealed that Damian's body was stolen from the Manor cemetery by the League of Assassins along with Talia's for plans against Batman in addition to make their resurrections. It has also been shown that Ra's al Ghul has begun to engineer more clones of Damian.<ref>''Batman, Incorporated'' vol. 2 #13 (August 2013)</ref>\n\n====Road to Resurrection====\nAfter being preoccupied with a series of cases in Gotham, Batman begins his attempt to reclaim Damian's body despite Ra's claim that he wishes to resurrect his daughter and grandson. Batman continues his pursuit out of his distrust towards Ra's. After defeating Damian's half-aquatic clones with [[Aquaman]], Batman seeks [[Wonder Woman]]'s help in chasing Ra's to [[Themyscira (DC Comics)|Themyscira]].<ref>''Batman and Aquaman'' vol. 2 #29 (March 2014)</ref> Though Ra's attempts to resurrect Damian alongside Talia in what he thought was a Lazarus Pit in the island in addition to brainwash his grandson into joining him afterwards, instead Ra's discovers that it is a portal to a Netherworld in the Pit's former location, of which both Wonder Woman and Batman were already aware. Ra's flees with the bodies afterwards.<ref>''Batman and Wonder Woman'' vol. 2 #30 (April 2014)</ref>\n\nAfter Batman and [[Frankenstein (DC Comics)|Frankenstein]] locate Ra's and the bodies, they are too late as Ra's has successfully had them placed in a Lazarus Pit, leaving Batman in dread of Damian's fate.<ref>''Batman and Frankenstein'' vol. 2 #31 (May 2014)</ref> The resurrections fail, leaving Ra's to realize his arrogance for allowing the Heretic to kill his grandson, and regret allowing Talia to clone Damian. After defeating Ra's in combat, Batman reclaims Damian's body and threatens his son's maternal grandfather that if he steals his son's body again, he will kill him in retaliation. They later encounter [[Darkseid]]'s elite member [[Glorious Godfrey]], setting in motion the ''Robin Rises'' story arc.<ref>''Batman and Ra's al Ghul'' vol. 2 #32 (June 2014)</ref>\n\n====Return====\nLater, Godfrey's reason for coming to Earth is revealed; to retrieve the Chaos Shard, a powerful crystal that once belonged to Darkseid which Ra's revealed was hidden inside the sarcophagus he crafted for Damian. After detecting a trace signature of the shard coming from inside Damian's body, Godfrey escapes with Damian's corpse back to Apokolips, despite assistance from the Justice League. Angered, Batman once again vows to retrieve his son's corpse.<ref>''Robin Rises: Omega'' one-shot (July 2014)</ref>\n\nBatman enters and accesses the Justice League Watchtower to use his unstable exosuit known as the Hellbat armor designed by Batman himself and the Justice League members to engage large scale threats.<ref>''Batman and Robin'' vol. 2 #33 (July 2014)</ref> He then activates the Boom Tube to Darkseid's homeworld, Apokolips, to retrieve Damian's corpse.<ref>''Batman and Robin'' vol. 2 #34 (August 2014)</ref> Batman successfully retrieves his son's corpse as he and his family team return to Earth via the Boom Tube directly to the Batcave after successfully escaping the clutches of Darkseid and his Parademons. After this, Batman uses the Chaos Shard on his son's corpse, which has been infused with Darkseid\u2019s Omega Sanction. With Batman facing two choices of whether to resurrect Damian or his parents, he chooses his son, granting Damian's true resurrection. As Damian and Batman embrace, Batman collapses from exhaustion.<ref>''Batman and Robin'' vol. 2 #37 (December 2014)</ref>\n\nHowever, before the team can celebrate, the Boom Tube used to return to Earth was not closed and Darkseid's son Kalibak arrives and attacks the team. During the fight, Kalibak beats the team nearly to death, when suddenly Damian knocks out Kalibak with a powerful uppercut; discovering that due to the Chaos Shard he has gained superhuman abilities. While Damian fights Kalibak, Batman remotely controls the Batwing and sends it crashing into Kalibak, sending him back through the Boom Tube and then closes the portal. Damian then reunites with his father and his family team. In the aftermath, Damian is tested by Batman on how to control his new power abilities before Damian returns to the role as Robin.<ref>''Robin Rises: Alpha'' one-shot (December 2014)</ref> With help from the Justice League, Batman discovers that Damian's new powers do not last, and he eventually relies on his natural abilities once more.<ref>''Batman and Robin'' vol. 2 #40 (March 2015)</ref>\n\n[[File:Damian Wayne Rebirth.png|thumb|right|upright|Damian Wayne in [[DC Rebirth]]; art by Jim Lee, Scott Williams, and Lex Sinclair]]\n\n====''Robin: Son of Batman''====\nAfter the events of ''[[Batman: Endgame]]'' that resulted in Bruce Wayne's disappearance, Damian, as Robin, sets out on a globe-spanning journey to forge his own destiny and make amends for all of his wrongdoings in his own series, titled ''Robin: Son of Batman''. Along his journey, he crosses paths with Ra's and Talia al Ghul, Deathstroke, and a new character named Maya Ducard, daughter of the late villain, NoBody. Damian plays a particular role in ''[[Batman and Robin Eternal]]'' when the Bat-Family is pitted against Mother, a ruthless woman who believes that she can make her 'children' stronger by putting them through intense trauma. Returning to assist his fellow Robins as the crisis reaches its conclusion, Damian helps Dick, Jason and Tim regain confidence in themselves after Mother decimates their initial efforts against her by recalling a conversation he had with Bruce where Bruce noted that he is proud of how all three of the other Robins have different strengths, Bruce wanting his partners to find their own paths rather than blindly follow his own example.<ref>''Batman & Robin Eternal'' #22</ref>\n\nDamian is also a major player in the ''[[Robin War]]'' event, where he, Agent 37 (Dick Grayson), Red Hood, and Red Robin organize a street gang called \"Robins\" to defeat the Court of Owls with reluctant aid from Jim Gordon, who is now Batman. In the climax, the Court manipulates Damian into joining them so they can use him to recruit Agent 37. Dick does join in order to save Damian and end the war. In the aftermath, Robin forms an unlikely partnership with his mother Talia.\n\n===DC Rebirth===\n{{Update|date=August 2017}}\nAs part of the [[DC Rebirth]], Damian is featured in three titles: ''Teen Titans'', where he becomes the team's leader in order to defeat Ra's al Ghul and succeed Red Robin (Tim Drake) as leader, ''Super Sons'', co-starring with [[Jonathan Samuel Kent|Jon Kent]], the son of Superman and the new Superboy and ''Nightwing'', where he will have a supporting role.\n===Teen Titans Rebirth===\nOn his 13th birthday Damian is sent a package by his grandfather Ra's al Ghul, which contains a dead robin. After a meeting with his mother Talia, he discovers that it is a warning from his cousin Mara al Ghul, who has chosen him as her prey as part of an initiation ritual that she must undertake in order to properly join the League of Assassins. Mara has been made leader of a group known as the Demon's Fist, which was originally supposed to be led by Damian, but became hers when he chose to leave the League. They, too, have chosen targets that they must hunt down in order to ascend to the League. Damian decides to collect the other Demon's Fist's targets in order to form the new Teen Titans; this includes [[Starfire (Koriand'r)|Starfire]], [[Beast Boy]], [[Raven (DC Comics)|Raven]] and [[Wally West II|Kid Flash]].\n\nAfter the events of ''Justice League: No Justice'', the Titans disband. In his subsequent struggle with organized crime in Gotham and a mysterious crime lord known as The Other, Damian assembles a new team of Titans, consisting of Kid Flash (the only old team member to join), Kid Flash's friend and kid genius Roundhouse, [[Emiko Queen|Red Arrow]], [[Lobo (DC Comics)|Lobo's]] daughter Crush, and the immortal [[Jinn|spirit creature]] Djinn.<ref>''Teen Titans Special'' #1 (2018), ''Teen Titans'' #20 (July 2018)</ref> This new team faces initial difficulties because of Red Arrow's criticism and the individualistic tendencies of several members. During a case in which [[Gizmo (DC Comics)|Gizmo]] nearly detonates a nuclear device, Robin uses the ring to which Djinn is bound to grant her the use of her full powers to avert the crisis, and returns it afterwards, refusing to assume mastery over her. This earns him Djinn's trust, which gradually begins to turn into a mutual romantic attraction.<ref>''Teen Titans'' #21 (August 2018)</ref> However, what Damian does not tell his teammates is that a deep cellar of the Titans' headquarters, a former juvenile detention facility, serves him as a secret dungeon to lock away the most dangerous criminals he captures for good, including [[Deathstroke]], Gizmo, [[Brother Blood]], [[Black Mask (comics)|Black Mask]], and [[Atomic Skull#Joseph Martin|Atomic Skull]].<ref>''Teen Titans'' #20 (July 2018)</ref> \n\nHis teammates are also unaware that he is working with [[Jason Todd]], who goes by the alias Outlaw<ref>Lobdell, Scott (w), Woods, Pete (a), Peteri, Troy (let), Marie Javins, Rob Levin (ed). \"Outlaw, Part One\" ''Red Hood and the Outlaws'' 26 (November, 2018), New York: DC Comics</ref>. Due to a miscommunication, Damian can no longer trust him, which ultimately leads them to cut ties.\n\nEventually, Kid Flash discovers the secret prison,<ref>''Teen Titans'' #28 (March 2019)</ref> and Crush, who [[LGBT themes in comics|has fallen for Djinn]], kisses her, showing her the kind of genuine affection which Damian in his grimness never really did.<ref>''Teen Titans'' #29 (April 2019)</ref> When the other Titans find out, and when Red Arrow kills Deathstroke,<ref>''Deathstroke'' #43</ref> conflict erupts within the team until [[Lobo (DC Comics)|Lobo]], looking for Crush, crashes in.<ref>''Teen Titans'' #30-32 (May-July 2019)</ref> Djinn defeats him by altering his memory, and proceeds to do so with the other criminals Damian captures, giving them new, harmless identities.<ref>''Teen Titans'' #33 (August 2019)</ref>\n\n===Super Sons===\nIn this book Robin is teamed up with Superman's son Jonathan Kent. Together they team and become the Super Sons. In the first volume Damian and Jon team up to defeat Kid Amazo. Kid Amazo was a person affected by the Amazo virus a virus that grants humans powers. They defeat him and Damian decides to train Jon. Batman gives them an underwater base which later gets destroyed. Currently the team is over due to changes made to Jon's character.<ref>Superman #8 (2018)</ref>\n\n==Skills and Abilities==\nHaving been trained by the [[League of Assassins]] since birth, Damian is already an expert in martial arts and in wielding a wide range of weaponry. Despite his age, Damian has taken on and bested trained fighters like Talia Al Ghul, Red Hood (Jason Todd), Red Robin (Tim Drake), and the Joker, amongst others. He was also trained in the disciplines of forensics, acrobatics, criminology, disguise and escapology. Damian is skilled in mimicking voices and speech patterns of others accurately, as he was able to imitate his father's and Tim Drake's voices in order to bypass the Batcave's voice-recognition security systems.<ref name=\"Batman #658\"/> Damian is shown to have highly advanced engineering skills, as he was able to complete his father's plans of building a flying Batmobile, the construction of which Alfred described as \"being an endless source of frustration to Damian's father\". Damian is also a capable businessman despite his young age, being involved with [[Wayne Enterprises]] and its board members. He also has been trained in numerous weapons as shown in the ''Blackest Night'' event.<ref>''Batman: Blackest Night'' vol 1 #2</ref> Damian possessed superpowers similar to that of Superman following his resurrection, though this was short-lived. However, he is shown to possess healing abilities and powers in the future.\n\n==Appearance==\n[[File:Robin (Damian Wayne).jpg|thumb|upright|Damian Wayne on the cover of ''Batman and Robin'' #1 (August 2009). Art by J.G. Jones.]]\nAfter stealing [[Jason Todd]]'s Robin tunic and mask from his memorial case, Damian's unofficial appearance as Robin was wearing them over his black and white League of Assassins bodysuit with a grayish hood and cape. He carried a pair of [[brass knuckles]], which he incorporated as part of this costume, and would also carry a sword.\n\nAfter Dick Grayson officially sanctioned Damian's role as Robin, while a standard Robin tunic was retained, the bodysuit was replaced with a black survival suit, the grayish cape with a yellow \"para-cape\" which grants him a [[gliding]] capability, the black mask with a green one, a bulkier utility belt to carry more arsenal and gadgetry, a black hood, and flexible green gloves and boots.\n\nAs of age 13, Damian was short for his age and had few other markers of impending puberty, in [[Super-Sons|Super Sons]] it was a running joke that he was frequently mistaken as younger than ten-year-old [[Jonathan Samuel Kent|Jonathan Kent]].\n\n==Other versions==\n{{Further|Alternate versions of Robin}}\nReferences in current continuity have been made to the future of Bruce and Talia's son.\n\n* In ''[[DC One Million]]'' (1999), written by Grant Morrison, a Batman from the 853rd Century references a Dark Knight's battle with Two-Face-Two, which ''Batman'' #700 (2010) depicts with Damian Wayne.<ref>''Batman'' #700</ref>\n* In ''[[Teen Titans]]'' vol. 3 #18 (2006), when the Teen Titans were transported 10 years into the future, a graveyard full of deceased Batman allies and villains is depicted.

This version is a stark departure from his original counterpart: his father remains [[Batman]] (Bruce Wayne) but his mother is [[Catwoman]] (Selina Kyle), bears no intent to kill at all and acts much more like his father and his costume is similar to [[Tim Drake]]'s second Robin costume. Initially portrayed as being reluctant to follow in his father's footsteps, he tells his parents that he does not want them to plot out his own life for him. But after his parents are killed by [[Joker (character)|Joker Jr.]], Damian takes up the Robin mantle and fights alongside [[Dick Grayson|Batman]] (Dick Grayson). Ultimately, the two bring Joker Jr. and the original Joker to justice and save Gotham from a poison gas attack. It shows that Damian goes on to fight the Club of Villains, Flamingo and [[Professor Pyg]]. The episode ends with Dick passing on the Batman mantle to Damian, who is then shown fighting crime with his own child (voiced by Sebastian Bader) as the new Robin. The pair are seen fighting the mutants from ''[[The Dark Knight Returns]]'', a reference which is further established by the new Robin's resemblance to the Robin ([[Carrie Kelley]]) from that comic. It ultimately turns out that the episode's events were part of [[Alfred Pennyworth]]'s book 'The Knights of Tomorrow'. This episode was based on a comic book story from the [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver Age]] in which Batman was married to [[Batwoman|Kathy Kane]] with their son [[Alternate versions of Robin|Bruce Wayne Jr.]]<ref>''Batman'' #131</ref>\n* The character is referenced in the ''[[Teen Titans Go!

He is seen in the episode \"Kid Napped\". \n* Damian Wayne makes his debut appearance, as cameo, in ''[[Young Justice: Outsiders]]'' episode \"Rescue Op\" as a newborn, held by his mother [[Talia al Ghul]]. This implies that he was born in the two-year time gap between this season and the previous ''Invasion'' season, that Batman and Talia had had their affair during that time.\n* Damian makes his web television debut as the current Robin in the adult animated series ''[[Harley Quinn (TV series)|Harley Quinn]]'', voiced by [[Jacob Tremblay]].<ref>https://deadline.com/2019/07/harley-quinn-dc-universe-kaley-cuoco-tca-patrick-schumacker-1202651411/</ref> He is portrayed as a spoiled brat whom most characters don't take seriously. In \"Finding Mr. Right\", in an effort to improve his reputation, he appears on a talk show and lies that [[Harley Quinn]] agreed to be his arch-enemy. Offended, Harley kidnaps him and dangles him over a tank with [[King Shark]] in it. When he confesses he lied, Harley reveals the talk show audience behind a curtain, humiliating him. King Shark goes berserk when he smells blood and nearly kills him, but his father Batman rescues him. The Joker then kidnaps him and Batman saves him again. Batman comforts him and says he can wait until he is ready for his own nemesis. In the season two premiere, \"New Gotham\", Damian took up the mantle of Batman after he disappeared in the chaos caused by Joker's destruction of Gotham during the season one finale despite not being old enough to do so.\n\n===Film===\n* Damian Wayne has a major role in ''[[Son of Batman]]'', voiced by [[Stuart Allan]].\n* Damian Wayne also appears in ''[[Batman vs. Robin]]'' as a sequel to ''Son of Batman'', with Stuart Allan reprising his role.\n* Damian Wayne appears in ''[[Batman: Bad Blood]]'', a sequel to ''Son of Batman'' and ''Batman vs. Robin'', with Stuart Allan reprising his role.

In 2006, following a line of more electronic orientated 12-inch  EPs, Trentem\u00f8ller released his debut album ''[[The Last Resort (album)|The Last Resort]]''. In 2007 he assembled his first full live band, with [[Henrik Vibskov]] on drums and [[Mikael Simpson]] on guitar. Complete with visuals from director Karim Ghahwagi, the ensuing \u2018Trentem\u00f8ller: Live In Concert\u2019 tour brought him to the United States for the first time as well as to festivals including [[Glastonbury Festival|Glastonbury]] (UK), [[Roskilde Festival|Roskilde]] (Denmark) and [[Melt! Festival|Melt!]] (Germany).\n\nIn 2009, ''[[The Trentem\u00f8ller Chronicles]]'', a double compilation of unreleased songs, non-album tracks and remixes for acts including [[R\u00f6yksopp]], [[Moby]] and [[The Knife]], was released. He also headlined the Orange Stage at Roskilde Festival, playing in front of 60,000 people, with a set design created by Vibskov.\n\nAfter starting up his own record label, In My Room, Trentem\u00f8ller\u2019s second album ''[[Into the Great Wide Yonder]]'' was released in 2010. It was a move into a more analogue sound influenced by indie and post punk, and incorporating more live instrumentation and vocals. Expanding his live band to seven people, he continued to tour around the world for two years. His appearance at 2011\u2019s [[Coachella Festival]] was described by ''[[NME]]'' as \u201cone of the biggest breakouts of Coachella,\u201d saying he \u201cstunned all onlookers and became the toast of the fest.\u201d<ref>{{cite web|title=Coachella 2011 - The 12 Most Memorable Moments|url=http://www.nme.com/blogs/nme-blogs/coachella-2011-the-12-most-memorable-moments|website=Nme.com|accessdate=19 April 2018}}</ref> Trentem\u00f8ller toured widely across the US and appeared on [[Carson Daly]]. The world tour ended with two shows in [[Freetown Christiania|Christiania]], Copenhagen, released as the live album ''Live In Copenhagen''.\n\nFollowing his second album, ''Reworked/Remixed'' was released, a compilation of Trentem\u00f8ller\u2019s remixes for other artists and other musicians' reworking of his music including [[Modeselektor]], [[UNKLE]], [[Franz Ferdinand (band)|Franz Ferdinand]], [[Andrew Weatherall]], [[Efterklang]] and [[Depeche Mode]]. Trentem\u00f8ller\u2019s music has also been used by film directors, including [[Oliver Stone]] (''[[Savages (2012 film)|Savages]]''), [[Pedro Almod\u00f3var]] (''[[The Skin I Live In]]''), and [[Jacques Audiard]] (''[[Rust and Bone]]'').\n\nIn September 2013, Trentem\u00f8ller released his third full-length album ''[[Lost (Trentem\u00f8ller album)|Lost]]'', including collaborations with [[Low (band)|Low]], Jonny Pierce from [[The Drums]], Marie Fisker, Kazu Makino of [[Blonde Redhead]], Jana Hunter of [[Lower Dens]], [[Ghost Society]] and Sune Wagner of [[The Raveonettes]]. That year, Trentem\u00f8ller also supported [[Depeche Mode]] on their [[Delta Machine]] world tour and appeared at Melt!, Dour, Pitch and Zurich Open Air.
