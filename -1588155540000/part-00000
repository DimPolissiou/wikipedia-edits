The Norse settlement was named Stroma which translates as 'Tide race river', referring to the speed of the tidal emptying and filling of the aforementioned basin, (est 9 knots). It is claimed that the name Montrose stems from 'Mouth Hrossay' due to the location at the outlets of the [[River North Esk|River Esk]] near Rossie Island (Norse: horse island). The etymology is alternatively attributed to the [[G\u00e0idhlig|gaelic]] words ''Monadh'' (meaning moor) and Rois or Ros (meaning peninsula or promontory). The first documentary evidence of the existence of Montrose is the burgh charter issued by [[David I of Scotland|David I]] who founded the town around 1140 as ''Sallorch'' or ''Sallork''.<ref name=\"angus.gov.uk\">[http://www.angus.gov.uk/history/features/rbmontr.htm \"The Royal Burgh of Montrose\", Angus Council] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060623025501/http://www.angus.gov.uk/history/features/rbmontr.htm |date=23 June 2006 }}</ref> By 1178 the name had taken the form ''Munross'' before becoming ''Montrose''.<ref>A.D Mills, ''A Dictionary of British Place-Names''.

During the 1140s it was an important trading town. The trading revenues received from Montrose as well as [[Forfar]] and [[Dundee]] were acquired by [[Malcolm IV]] and contributed to [[Restenneth Priory]].<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> In 1178 [[William the Lion]] built a castle nearby in which he would occasionally reside.

Some accounts state that it was there that he humiliated Scottish King [[John de Balliol]] by publicly stripping him of his royal insignia and status; other accounts claim that this occurred in [[Brechin]].<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> Twelve burgesses of the town swore allegiance to Edward I<ref name=\"Mitchell 1866, p8\"/> to protect themselves and the community of the town.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> The following year the castle, which was manned by an English garrison,  was destroyed by [[William Wallace]] who is said to have slain all soldiers in sight.<ref name=\"Mitchell 1866, p8\"/> The site of the castle, known as Castlestead, is at the southern end of the High Street. [[David II of Scotland|David II]] visited it towards the end of his reign in 1371.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> [[Duke of Montrose|The Dukedom of Montrose]] was created in 1488.\n\nDuring the 15th century the inhabitants of the town found themselves increasingly under heel of the Lairds of Dun who ransacked and took possession of property and cattle. The lairds are said to have arrived in the middle of one night on horseback heavily armed. The burghesses of the town immediately sent out an appeal to the Duke of Montrose for protection but the messenger was purportedly murdered before the appeal arrived. It was then that [[James IV of Scotland]] intervened and settled the matter.<ref name=\"Mitchell 1866, p8\"/>\n\n===Modern history===\n[[File:Montrose and The Steeple - geograph.org.uk - 487549.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Montrose and the steeple]]\nFrom its early inception as a port Montrose had traded in skins, hides and cured salmon but in the 17th century began to export wheat and barley in regular trading transactions with the [[Hanseatic League]]. The town imported flax and timber from the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]]; salt, fruit and wine from [[France]] and [[Portugal]].<ref name=\"angus.gov.uk\"/> The wealth this brought to the town is demonstrated in the surviving houses built by landowning and merchant families as well as local street names of \"America Street\", \"California Street\", \"Baltic Street\" and \"India Street\" evidencing its trading heritage.\n[[File:A Park at Montrose - geograph.org.uk - 1311715.jpg|left|thumb|Park in Montrose]]\nThe site of the castle, now known as Castlestead was the birthplace of the famous [[James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose]]. Graham signed the National Covenant against [[Charles I of England|Charles I]]'s reorganisation of the Kirk in Scotland, fighting in the ensuing Bishops' Wars, but later switched to the King's side only to be captured and executed in [[Edinburgh]] in the year 1650.\n\nThe final chapter of the ill-fated 1715 Jacobite rebellion was also played out in Montrose. Towards the end of the uprising (which had lasted nearly six months, from September 1715 to February 1716) [[James Francis Edward Stuart]] (the Old Pretender; formerly James, Prince of Wales) arrived in Montrose, where he spent his last night in Scotland, on 4 February 1716. He sailed from Montrose to exile in France. The town was held for his son, [[Charles Edward Stuart]] (Bonnie Prince Charlie; the Young Pretender), 30 years later and in February 1746 the largest naval battle of the war was fought in Montrose Harbour.\n\nDuring the 18th century the town was a major [[smuggling]] centre. It profited from the slave trade but only for a brief time. The wealth accrued by trade was substantial. Wealthy merchants in the 18th and 19th centuries dominated the town and built their houses gable to gable. Hence Montrosians have inherited the sobriquet, \"gable-enders\".<ref>Alan Murphy, Scotland, Footprint Travel Guides. 2004, p504</ref> A statistical account taken between 1791 and 1799 estimates the population in the 1750s as 4248; in 1776 as 4465; in 1784 as 4866 and in 1790 as 5194.

Its facilities were expanded several in the next few decades and it underwent various changes in name, finally becoming Sunnyside Royal Hospital in 1962.

As well as a training base Montrose was also an operational airfield for [[Hawker Hurricane]] and [[Supermarine Spitfire]] squadrons, which flew sorties over [[Norway]] and were a part of the air defences for [[Edinburgh]]. Of course, this also made the town a target for German aircraft and it was bombed on more than one occasion.

The Norse settlement was named Stroma which translates as 'Tide race river', referring to the speed of the tidal emptying and filling of the aforementioned basin, (est 9 knots). It is claimed that the name Montrose stems from 'Mouth Hrossay' due to the location at the outlets of the [[River North Esk|River Esk]] near Rossie Island (Norse: horse island). The etymology is alternatively attributed to the [[G\u00e0idhlig|gaelic]] words ''Monadh'' (meaning moor) and Rois or Ros (meaning peninsula or promontory). The first documentary evidence of the existence of Montrose is the burgh charter issued by [[David I of Scotland|David I]] who founded the town around 1140 as ''Sallorch'' or ''Sallork''.<ref name=\"angus.gov.uk\">[http://www.angus.gov.uk/history/features/rbmontr.htm \"The Royal Burgh of Montrose\", Angus Council] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060623025501/http://www.angus.gov.uk/history/features/rbmontr.htm |date=23 June 2006 }}</ref> By 1178 the name had taken the form ''Munross'' before becoming ''Montrose''.<ref>A.D Mills, ''A Dictionary of British Place-Names''.

During the 1140s it was an important trading town. The trading revenues received from Montrose as well as [[Forfar]] and [[Dundee]] were acquired by [[Malcolm IV]] and contributed to [[Restenneth Priory]].<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> In 1178 [[William the Lion]] built a castle nearby in which he would occasionally reside.

Some accounts state that it was there that he humiliated Scottish King [[John de Balliol]] by publicly stripping him of his royal insignia and status; other accounts claim that this occurred in [[Brechin]].<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> Twelve burgesses of the town swore allegiance to Edward I<ref name=\"Mitchell 1866, p8\"/> to protect themselves and the community of the town.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> The following year the castle, which was manned by an English garrison,  was destroyed by [[William Wallace]] who is said to have slain all soldiers in sight.<ref name=\"Mitchell 1866, p8\"/> The site of the castle, known as Castlestead, is at the southern end of the High Street. [[David II of Scotland|David II]] visited it towards the end of his reign in 1371.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> [[Duke of Montrose|The Dukedom of Montrose]] was created in 1488.\n\nDuring the 15th century the inhabitants of the town found themselves increasingly under heel of the Lairds of Dun who ransacked and took possession of property and cattle. The lairds are said to have arrived in the middle of one night on horseback heavily armed. The burghesses of the town immediately sent out an appeal to the Duke of Montrose for protection but the messenger was purportedly murdered before the appeal arrived. It was then that [[James IV of Scotland]] intervened and settled the matter.<ref name=\"Mitchell 1866, p8\"/>\n\n===Modern history===\n[[File:Montrose and The Steeple - geograph.org.uk - 487549.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Montrose and the steeple]]\nFrom its early inception as a port Montrose had traded in skins, hides and cured salmon but in the 17th century began to export wheat and barley in regular trading transactions with the [[Hanseatic League]]. The town imported flax and timber from the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]]; salt, fruit and wine from [[France]] and [[Portugal]].<ref name=\"angus.gov.uk\"/> The wealth this brought to the town is demonstrated in the surviving houses built by landowning and merchant families as well as local street names of \"America Street\", \"California Street\", \"Baltic Street\" and \"India Street\" evidencing its trading heritage.\n[[File:A Park at Montrose - geograph.org.uk - 1311715.jpg|left|thumb|Park in Montrose]]\nThe site of the castle, now known as Castlestead was the birthplace of the famous [[James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose]]. Graham signed the National Covenant against [[Charles I of England|Charles I]]'s reorganisation of the Kirk in Scotland, fighting in the ensuing Bishops' Wars, but later switched to the King's side only to be captured and executed in [[Edinburgh]] in the year 1650.\n\nThe final chapter of the ill-fated 1715 Jacobite rebellion was also played out in Montrose. Towards the end of the uprising (which had lasted nearly six months, from September 1715 to February 1716) [[James Francis Edward Stuart]] (the Old Pretender; formerly James, Prince of Wales) arrived in Montrose, where he spent his last night in Scotland, on 4 February 1716. He sailed from Montrose to exile in France. The town was held for his son, [[Charles Edward Stuart]] (Bonnie Prince Charlie; the Young Pretender), 30 years later and in February 1746 the largest naval battle of the war was fought in Montrose Harbour.\n\nDuring the 18th century the town was a major [[smuggling]] centre. It profited from the slave trade but only for a brief time. The wealth accrued by trade was substantial. Wealthy merchants in the 18th and 19th centuries dominated the town and built their houses gable to gable. Hence Montrosians have inherited the sobriquet, \"gable-enders\".<ref>Alan Murphy, Scotland, Footprint Travel Guides. 2004, p504</ref> A statistical account taken between 1791 and 1799 estimates the population in the 1750s as 4248; in 1776 as 4465; in 1784 as 4866 and in 1790 as 5194.

Its facilities were expanded several in the next few decades and it underwent various changes in name, finally becoming Sunnyside Royal Hospital in 1962.

Despite its coastal location presenting a danger however, large numbers of children and young mothers from [[Dundee]] were evacuated there during the period of the [[Phoney War]].

He saved the life of Lieutenant Commander Olav Nilsen at Dundee Docks and generally protected his fellow sailors.

Guatemala have never qualified for the finals tournament of the [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]], although they have reached the final round of qualification on four occasions.\n\nGuatemala won the [[1967 CONCACAF Championship]] and the [[2001 UNCAF Nations Cup]]. The team's best performance in a [[CONCACAF Gold Cup]] was in [[1996 CONCACAF Gold Cup|1996]], when they finished fourth.

The team was split into two sides, blue and white. With time, clubs were made and eventually the Guatemalan National Team was created in 1921. Guatemala had its first game on September 14, 1921 against [[Honduras national football team|Honduras]]. The game was played in Guatemala City and Guatemala beat Honduras 10 to 1.<ref>RSSSF.com: [http://www.rsssf.com/tablesg/guat-intres.html \u00abGuatemala \u2013 List of International Matches\u00bb] (en ingl\u00e9s)</ref>\n\nGuatemala had success in several editions of the [[CCCF Championship]] (Copa CCCF), precursor to the [[CONCACAF Gold Cup|Concacaf Gold Cup]] (Copa Concacaf), by being the runner up in three championships, [[1943 CCCF Championship|1943]], [[1946 CCCF Championship|1946]], and [[1948 CCCF Championship|1948]]. In [[1958 FIFA World Cup|1958]], Guatemala began participating in the qualifying rounds of the World Cup.

In [[1962 FIFA World Cup|1962]] it was able to tie against both Costa Rica (4\u20134), while playing in Guatemala, and Honduras (1\u20131), while playing in [[Tegucigalpa]].

Before the process of elimination began, the [[FIFA]] (International Federation of Association Football) refused Guatemala\u2019s participation for administrative reasons.\n\nThe Guatemalan National Team joined Concacaf in [[1961 CCCF Championship|1961]]. In [[1967 CONCACAF Championship|1967]] it again showed the progress it had made when it participated in the Concacaf Gold Cup. For the first time and only time in its history, it placed first in the tournament.<ref>{{cite web|title=CONCACAF NATIONS CUP 1967|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablesc/conca67.html|website=rsssf.com|accessdate=2017-03-05}}</ref> It was also the runner up in both [[1965 CONCACAF Championship|1965]] and [[1969 CONCACAF Championship|1969]].\n\n===1967 CONCACAF Championship===\n{{main|1967 CONCACAF Championship}}\nIn 1967, [[Honduras]] hosted the [[CONCACAF Championship]]. Guatemala began the tournament with a 2\u20131 win against [[Haiti national football team|Haiti]], followed by a 1\u20130 win over defending champions [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]], a 0\u20130 draw against [[Honduras national football team|Honduras]], a 2\u20130 win over [[Trinidad and Tobago national football team|Trinidad and Tobago]], and a 2\u20130 win over [[Nicaragua national football team|Nicaragua]], being crowned [[CONCACAF]] champions for the first time. Forward Manuel \"Escopeta\" Recinos was Guatemala's top scorer with four goals, including the game-winning goal against [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]].\n\n'''Results'''\n{| class=\"wikitable\" style=\"text-align: center;\"\n|-\n!width=30|Rank\n!width=165 style=\"text-align:left;\"|Team\n!width=20|Pts\n!width=20|Pld\n!width=20|W\n!width=20|D\n!width=20|L\n!width=20|GF\n!width=20|GA\n!width=20|GD\n|- style=\"background:#ccffcc;\"\n|'''1'''\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{fb|GUA}}\n|'''9'''||5||4||1||0||7||1||6\n|-\n|'''2'''\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{fb|MEX}}\n|'''8'''||5||4||0||1||10||1||9\n|-\n|'''3'''\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{fb|HON}}\n|'''6'''||5||2||2||1||4||2||2\n|-\n|'''4'''\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{fb|TRI}}\n|'''4'''||5||2||0||3||6||10||\u22124\n|-\n|'''5'''\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"| {{fb|HAI}}\n|'''2'''||5||1||0||4||5||9||\u22124\n|-\n|'''6'''\n|style=\"text-align:left;\"|{{fb|NCA}}\n|'''1'''||5||0||1||4||3||12||\u22129\n|}\n\n===1968 Olympic Games===\nIn 1967, Guatemala showed some major progress by qualifying for the [[Football at the 1968 Summer Olympics|1968 Olympic Tournament]] in [[Mexico City]]. In the first round, they won 1\u20130 against [[Czechoslovakia national football team|Czechoslovakia]], and 4\u20131 against [[Thailand national football team|Thailand]], and lost to [[Bulgaria national football team|Bulgaria]] 2\u20131. They went on the next round where they lost to eventual champions [[Hungary national football team|Hungary]] 1\u20130.\n\n===21st century===\n===2006 FIFA World Cup qualification===\nPrior to the qualification process, many fans saw Carlos Ruiz as the main focus in providing goals for the national team along with his compatriot but elder Juan Carlos Plata. Many other stars such as Fredy, Garcia, Gonzalo Romero, Guillermo Ramirez and Martin Machon were expected to play huge roles as well. In [[2006 FIFA World Cup qualification (CONCACAF)|2006 World Cup qualifying]], Guatemala started off well, advancing to the third round by beating [[Suriname national football team|Suriname]] 4\u20132 in the second round. In the third round they finished second behind [[Costa Rica national football team|Costa Rica]] in Group B tying at 10 points each, advancing to the final round. In the fourth round they started off well with a 0\u20130 draw against [[Panama national football team|Panama]] and a 5\u20131 win against [[Trinidad and Tobago national football team|Trinidad and Tobago]]. Then followed a 2\u20130 loss against [[United States men's national soccer team|United States]] and [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]] and a 3\u20132 loss against [[Costa Rica national football team|Costa Rica]], and after 3 losses in a row they finally won against [[Panama national football team|Panama]] 2\u20131, then lost against [[Trinidad and Tobago national football team|Trinidad and Tobago]] 3\u20132, tied against [[United States men's national soccer team|United States]] 0\u20130 and then lost to [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]] 5\u20132 once again. Guatemala had 8 points with one game left, and a win and a [[Trinidad and Tobago national football team|Trinidad and Tobago]] loss against [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]] would get them to [[2006 FIFA World Cup qualification (AFC&nbsp;\u2013 CONCACAF play-off)|the playoff]]. They won 3\u20131 against [[Costa Rica national football team|Costa Rica]] but [[Trinidad and Tobago national football team|Trinidad and Tobago]] beat [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]] 2\u20131, ending one of the best runs in Guatemala football history. They finished in 5th place, 2 points away from a possible World Cup spot. Juan Carlos Plata and Martin Mach\u00f3n had announced their retirement from International Football in 2006.\n\n===2010 FIFA World Cup qualification===\nAfter a third-place finish at the [[2007 UNCAF Nations Cup]], and reaching the knockout stage in the [[2007 CONCACAF Gold Cup|Gold Cup]] of the same year, along with a couple of satisfying friendly matches including a 3\u20132 win against Mexico; many saw [[Hern\u00e1n Dar\u00edo G\u00f3mez]] as the next coach to lead Guatemala into the Hexagonal in the World Cup qualifying stage. However, after losing 5\u20130 in early 2008 against a U-23 Argentine team, fans wanted Gomez out as coach and soon the Colombian would do so. During [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification (CONCACAF)|2010 World Cup qualifying]], expectations of being able to qualify for the finals were set among the national team as Ramon Maradiaga had returned as coach after almost leading Guatemala to the World Cup 2006. They began well by having advanced to the third round by defeating [[Saint Lucia national football team|Saint Lucia]] in a 9\u20131 aggregate in the second round. \n\nIn the third round, Guatemala began with a 1\u20130 home loss to the United States, with controversies surrounding Panamanian referee Roberto Moreno, who was arbitrating the match, including not awarding a penalty in the first half in the favor of Guatemala after a handball from Steve Cherundolo as well as [[Gustavo Adolfo Cabrera|Gustavo Cabrera]] being sent off after colliding with Eddie Lewis in the second half. In their second match of round 3, Los Chapines were able to take home a draw in the closing minutes of the game against Trinidad and Tobago in Port of Spain after [[Carlos Eduardo Gallardo|Carlos Gallardo]] deflected a free kick taken by Marco Pappa with his heels. On September 10, Guatemala welcomed Cuba at home for their third match. Cuba shocked the Guatemala fans by taking the lead after Roberto Linares scored in the 25th minute however by halftime, [[Carlos Ruiz (Guatemalan footballer)|Carlos Ruiz]] relieved the team with an equalizer. In the second half Carlos Ruiz scored once more, while [[Mario Rafael Rodr\u00edguez|Mario Rodr\u00edguez]] and youngster [[Jos\u00e9 Manuel Contreras]] also scored and finished the game 4\u20131. With the win, they were able to collect 4 points, putting them in second place due to having a better goal difference than Trinidad and Tobago. The next two matches would be crucial in advancing to the next round. \n\nOn October 11, many fans gathered around the Estadio Mateo Flores to support the national team in their home game against Trinidad and Tobago, heavily expecting a win. Despite being reduced to 10 men, the Soca Warriors were able to hold Guatemala to 0\u20130 stalemate, disgruntling the national team and fans. With hopes of getting a result in Havana four days later, Guatemala were unable to even get a point against Cuba, falling down 1\u20130 by halftime after Jaime Colome scored a penalty. Marco Pappa volleyed in an equalizer in the 80th minute, replenishing the confidence for the team but Urgelles was able to bring Cuba back on top in the 90th minute, complicating the hopes of Guatemala in qualifying for the World Cup with one game to spare. Meanwhile, the Trinidadians defeated the United States 2\u20131 at home, putting them in second place. Maradiaga was fired soon right after and Benjamin Monterroso, a less ambitious coach was appointed, focusing on the upcoming edition of the Copa Uncaf the following January. A 2\u20130 away loss against the US confirmed the elimination of the national team, having finished in third place with 5 points, thus missing out on the World Cup. \n\nAt the Uncaf nations cup, Monterroso wanted to introduce more younger players into the starting line up such as Minor Lopez, Ricardo Jerez and Wilson Lalin but everything backfired after losing both group stage matches against Costa Rica and Panama as well as losing astonishingly 2\u20130 to an inferior Nicaragua team in the play off match for the final berth to attend the next Gold Cup; Minor Lopez was the lone goal scorer for Los Bicolores. As a result, the national team were inactive for the next two years and Benjamin Monterroso shamefully stepped down after two months in charge.\n\n===2014 World Cup cycle===\nOn May 2010, Uruguayan born Paraguayan [[Ever Hugo Almeida]] was appointed as the next coach for Guatemala. At the [[2011 Copa Centroamericana]], formerly known as the \"UNCAF Nations Cup\", Guatemala finished in fifth place, losing to [[Costa Rica national football team|Costa Rica]] 2\u20130 and [[Honduras national football team|Honduras]] 3\u20131. In the fifth place match, they defeated [[Nicaragua national football team|Nicaragua]] 2\u20131 to qualify to the [[2011 CONCACAF Gold Cup|2011 Gold Cup]].\n\nAt the [[2011 CONCACAF Gold Cup|2011 Gold Cup]], Guatemala drew against [[Honduras national football team|Honduras]] 0\u20130 despite being reduced to nine men. In the next match, they suffer a loss against a physically superior [[Jamaica national football team|Jamaica]] 2\u20130 but managed to redeem themselves after having won against [[Grenada national football team|Grenada]] 4\u20130 goals from [[Jos\u00e9 Javier del \u00c1guila]], [[Marco Pappa]], Carlos Ruiz, and Carlos Gallardo. Placing among the best third place, they saw themselves advancing to the quarterfinals, where they lost against the reigning champions [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]] 2\u20131 although a long ball from Elias Vasquez to Carlos Ruiz gave them the lead in the first half.\n\nFor the [[2014 FIFA World Cup qualification (CONCACAF)|2014 World Cup qualifiers]], Guatemala opened the qualifying campaign in the second round by sweeping six wins in six games, advancing to the third round in the same group as [[United States men's national soccer team|USA]], [[Jamaica national football team|Jamaica]] and [[Antigua and Barbuda national football team|Antigua and Barbuda]]. Prior to the start of the third round, three of Guatemala's key players Guillermo Ramirez, Gustavo Cabrera and Yony Flores were sent home during a practice session after teammates Carlos Ruiz and Luis Rodriguez heard of their involvement in money laundering and bribery in fixing multiple fixtures; they were subsequently banned for life in participating in any football competition abroad or domestic.\n\nThe team had a rough start in an away loss to Jamaica with [[Dwight Pezzarossi]] only managing to pull back one goal in stoppage time. In the next match, Guatemala tied at home after Clint Dempsey managed to get a goal for the US, and Marco Pappa's free kick later in the game managed to bring Guatemala one point. For the third game in a row, also at home, the team fell behind against Antigua and Barbuda. In the second half with the Antiguan goalkeeper Molvin James sent off for wasting time, Carlos Ruiz was able to score a brace making the game 2\u20131; an additional goal from Dwight Pezzarossi eventually ended the game 3\u20131. Four days later, a lone goal from Carlos Ruiz sufficed for an away win against Antigua and Barbuda in North Sound.\n\nIn the next fixture, Guatemala beat Jamaica at home 2\u20131. In their last game, a minimum of a draw would be enough to get Guatemala to the final stage of the qualifiers. After taking the lead 1\u20130 in the first five minutes thanks to Carlos Ruiz, the USA team returned the favor by scoring 3 goals to crush their hopes. Guatemala finished ten points behind the [[United States men's national soccer team|USA]] and [[Jamaica national football team|Jamaica]], losing out on goal difference to the Jamaicans.\n\nIn January 2013, still led by [[Ever Almeida]], Guatemala participated in the [[2013 Copa Centroamericana]]. Consisted of mostly youngsters, Guatemala could only manage three draws in their group play (1\u20131 against [[Nicaragua national football team|Nicaragua]], 0\u20130 to border rivals [[Belize national football team|Belize]] and 1\u20131 against [[Costa Rica national football team|Costa Rica]]), losing out to Belize for direct qualification to the Gold Cup. They faced [[Panama national football team|Panama]] in the 5th place match for the final slot in the [[2013 CONCACAF Gold Cup|2013 Gold Cup]] in the United States but lost 3\u20131. Ever Almeida stepped down in favour of technical director [[Victor Hugo Monz\u00f3n]].\n\n===2016 suspension===\nOn Oct 28, 2016, the Guatemalan football federation was suspended indefinitely by FIFA, after the international football governing body had appointed an oversight committee to look into allegations of corruption.<ref>{{cite news | last=Menchu | first=Sofia | title=FIFA suspends Guatemalan soccer federation, citing resistance to oversight | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-soccer-fifa-guatemala-idUSKCN12S2ET | accessdate=2017-07-01 | publisher=Reuters | date=2016-10-28}}</ref> FIFA stated that the Guatemalan federation (FEDEFUT) had rejected the committee's mandate to run FEDEFUT's business, organize elections, and modernize its statutes, and would remain barred from international competition until FEDEFUT ratified an extension of the mandate.<ref>{{cite news | title=Guatemala suspended from international football | url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/soccer-fifa-guatemala-idUKL4N1CY56H | accessdate=2017-07-01 | publisher=Reuters | date=2016-10-28}}</ref>\nThe football team missed their chance on qualifying on the 2017 and 2019 CONCACAF Gold Cup tournaments ([[2017 Copa Centroamericana]] and [[2019\u201320 CONCACAF Nations League qualifying]], respectively) as they missed deadlines to have their suspension lifted.\n\nThe suspension was lifted on May 31, 2018 after FEDEFUT's normalization committee became fully operational.<ref>{{cite web|title=FIFA lifts suspension of Guatemalan Football Association|url=https://www.fifa.com/governance/news/y=2018/m=5/news=fifa-lifts-suspension-of-guatemalan-football-association.html|publisher=[[FIFA]]|date=31 May 2018|accessdate=5 July 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Home stadium==\n{{Main|Estadio Doroteo Guamuch Flores}}\nThe Estadio Nacional Mateo Flores, also known as Coloso de la Zona 5, is a multi-use national stadium in [[Guatemala City]], the largest in [[Guatemala]].

''[[National Football Federation of Guatemala|Federaci\u00f3n Nacional de F\u00fatbol de Guatemala]]''. Founded in 1919, it has been affiliated to [[FIFA]] since 1946, and it is a member of [[CONCACAF]].\n\nThe team has made three [[Football at the Summer Olympics|Olympic tournament]] appearances, competing at the [[Football at the 1968 Summer Olympics|1968]], [[Football at the 1976 Summer Olympics|1976]], and [[Football at the 1988 Summer Olympics|1988]] Olympic Games. Guatemala have never qualified for the finals tournament of the [[FIFA World Cup|World Cup]], although they have reached the final round of qualification on four occasions.\n\nGuatemala won the [[1967 CONCACAF Championship]] and the [[2001 UNCAF Nations Cup]]. The team's best performance in a [[CONCACAF Gold Cup]] was in [[1996 CONCACAF Gold Cup|1996]], when they finished fourth. Carlos Ruiz  their top goal scorer, retired his career after the failure of his team to now win the gold cup. Guatemala has also earned a [[bronze medal]] at the [[Football at the 1983 Pan American Games|1983 Pan American Games]] in [[Caracas]], [[Venezuela]]. The national team kits are supplied by [[Umbro]]. Past kit suppliers include [[Atletica]], [[Adidas]] and [[Puma SE|Puma]].\n\n==History==\nThe national team, nicknamed \"la Azul y Blanco\" (the blue and white), made its debut in the [[Independence Centenary Games]] held in [[Guatemala City]] in September 1921, winning their first game 10\u20131 against [[Honduras national football team|Honduras]]. In the final, Guatemala were defeated 6\u20130 by [[Costa Rica national football team|Costa Rica]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Courtney|first=Barrie |title=Guatemala International Soccer Matches Since 1920|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablesg/guat-intres.html|publisher=RSSSF|date=14 August 2008|accessdate=2 November 2010}}</ref> Guatemala entered a [[FIFA World Cup qualification|World Cup qualification]] process for the first time in 1958.\n\n===Beginnings and first attempt to reach World Cup===\nGuatemala created its first soccer team, made up of 22 players, on August 23, 1902. The team was split into two sides, blue and white. With time, clubs were made and eventually the Guatemalan National Team was created in 1921. Guatemala had its first game on September 14, 1921 against [[Honduras national football team|Honduras]]. The game was played in Guatemala City and Guatemala beat Honduras 10 to 1.<ref>RSSSF.com: [http://www.rsssf.com/tablesg/guat-intres.html \u00abGuatemala \u2013 List of International Matches\u00bb] (en ingl\u00e9s)</ref>\n\nGuatemala had success in several editions of the [[CCCF Championship]] (Copa CCCF), precursor to the [[CONCACAF Gold Cup|Concacaf Gold Cup]] (Copa Concacaf), by being the runner up in three championships, [[1943 CCCF Championship|1943]], [[1946 CCCF Championship|1946]], and [[1948 CCCF Championship|1948]]. In [[1958 FIFA World Cup|1958]], Guatemala began participating in the qualifying rounds of the World Cup. It was placed in the first group, along with the teams from [[Costa Rica national football team|Costa Rica]] and the [[Netherlands Antilles national football team|Netherlands Antilles]]. It placed last and was unable to score a single point.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Rinke|first1=Stefan|title=The FIFA World Cup 1930 \u2013 2010|date=2014|publisher=G\u00f6ttingen|location=Wallstein Verlag|isbn=9783835314573|pages=52\u201353}}</ref>\n\n===Success in the 60\u2019s===\nGuatemala\u2019s performance in the [[FIFA World Cup qualification|qualifying rounds]] began to improve in the beginning of the 1960s. In [[1962 FIFA World Cup|1962]] it was able to tie against both Costa Rica (4\u20134), while playing in Guatemala, and Honduras (1\u20131), while playing in [[Tegucigalpa]]. However, after being placed in the second group, it once again finished last.<ref>{{cite web|title=Preliminaries North, Central America and Caribbean|url=https://www.fifa.com/worldcup/archive/chile1962/groups/preliminaries/nccamerica/index.html|website=Fifa.com|accessdate=2017-03-05}}</ref>\n\nGuatemala did not participate in the qualifying round in [[1966 FIFA World Cup|1966]]. Before the process of elimination began, the [[FIFA]] (International Federation of Association Football) refused Guatemala\u2019s participation for administrative reasons.\n\nThe Guatemalan National Team joined Concacaf in [[1961 CCCF Championship|1961]]. In [[1967 CONCACAF Championship|1967]] it again showed the progress it had made when it participated in the Concacaf Gold Cup. For the first time and only time in its history, it placed first in the tournament.<ref>{{cite web|title=CONCACAF NATIONS CUP 1967|url=http://www.rsssf.com/tablesc/conca67.html|website=rsssf.com|accessdate=2017-03-05}}</ref> It was also the runner up in both [[1965 CONCACAF Championship|1965]] and [[1969 CONCACAF Championship|1969]].\n\n===1967 CONCACAF Championship===\n{{main|1967 CONCACAF Championship}}\nIn 1967, [[Honduras]] hosted the [[CONCACAF Championship]]. Guatemala began the tournament with a 2\u20131 win against [[Haiti national football team|Haiti]], followed by a 1\u20130 win over defending champions [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]], a 0\u20130 draw against [[Honduras national football team|Honduras]], a 2\u20130 win over [[Trinidad and Tobago national football team|Trinidad and Tobago]], and a 2\u20130 win over [[Nicaragua national football team|Nicaragua]], being crowned [[CONCACAF]] champions for the first time.

In the first round, they won 1\u20130 against [[Czechoslovakia national football team|Czechoslovakia]], and 4\u20131 against [[Thailand national football team|Thailand]], and lost to [[Bulgaria national football team|Bulgaria]] 2\u20131. They went on the next round where they lost to eventual champions [[Hungary national football team|Hungary]] 1\u20130.\n\n===21st century===\n===2006 FIFA World Cup qualification===\nPrior to the qualification process, many fans saw Carlos Ruiz as the main focus in providing goals for the national team along with his compatriot but elder Juan Carlos Plata. Many other stars such as Fredy, Garcia, Gonzalo Romero, Guillermo Ramirez and Martin Machon were expected to play huge roles as well. In [[2006 FIFA World Cup qualification (CONCACAF)|2006 World Cup qualifying]], Guatemala started off well, advancing to the third round by beating [[Suriname national football team|Suriname]] 4\u20132 in the second round. In the third round they finished second behind [[Costa Rica national football team|Costa Rica]] in Group B tying at 10 points each, advancing to the final round. In the fourth round they started off well with a 0\u20130 draw against [[Panama national football team|Panama]] and a 5\u20131 win against [[Trinidad and Tobago national football team|Trinidad and Tobago]]. Then followed a 2\u20130 loss against [[United States men's national soccer team|United States]] and [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]] and a 3\u20132 loss against [[Costa Rica national football team|Costa Rica]], and after 3 losses in a row they finally won against [[Panama national football team|Panama]] 2\u20131, then lost against [[Trinidad and Tobago national football team|Trinidad and Tobago]] 3\u20132, tied against [[United States men's national soccer team|United States]] 0\u20130 and then lost to [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]] 5\u20132 once again. Guatemala had 8 points with one game left, and a win and a [[Trinidad and Tobago national football team|Trinidad and Tobago]] loss against [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]] would get them to [[2006 FIFA World Cup qualification (AFC&nbsp;\u2013 CONCACAF play-off)|the playoff]]. They won 3\u20131 against [[Costa Rica national football team|Costa Rica]] but [[Trinidad and Tobago national football team|Trinidad and Tobago]] beat [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]] 2\u20131, ending one of the best runs in Guatemala football history. They finished in 5th place, 2 points away from a possible World Cup spot. Juan Carlos Plata and Martin Mach\u00f3n had announced their retirement from International Football in 2006.\n\n===2010 FIFA World Cup qualification===\nAfter a third-place finish at the [[2007 UNCAF Nations Cup]], and reaching the knockout stage in the [[2007 CONCACAF Gold Cup|Gold Cup]] of the same year, along with a couple of satisfying friendly matches including a 3\u20132 win against Mexico; many saw [[Hern\u00e1n Dar\u00edo G\u00f3mez]] as the next coach to lead Guatemala into the Hexagonal in the World Cup qualifying stage. However, after losing 5\u20130 in early 2008 against a U-23 Argentine team, fans wanted Gomez out as coach and soon the Colombian would do so. During [[2010 FIFA World Cup qualification (CONCACAF)|2010 World Cup qualifying]], expectations of being able to qualify for the finals were set among the national team as Ramon Maradiaga had returned as coach after almost leading Guatemala to the World Cup 2006. They began well by having advanced to the third round by defeating [[Saint Lucia national football team|Saint Lucia]] in a 9\u20131 aggregate in the second round. \n\nIn the third round, Guatemala began with a 1\u20130 home loss to the United States, with controversies surrounding Panamanian referee Roberto Moreno, who was arbitrating the match, including not awarding a penalty in the first half in the favor of Guatemala after a handball from Steve Cherundolo as well as [[Gustavo Adolfo Cabrera|Gustavo Cabrera]] being sent off after colliding with Eddie Lewis in the second half. In their second match of round 3, Los Chapines were able to take home a draw in the closing minutes of the game against Trinidad and Tobago in Port of Spain after [[Carlos Eduardo Gallardo|Carlos Gallardo]] deflected a free kick taken by Marco Pappa with his heels. On September 10, Guatemala welcomed Cuba at home for their third match. Cuba shocked the Guatemala fans by taking the lead after Roberto Linares scored in the 25th minute however by halftime, [[Carlos Ruiz (Guatemalan footballer)|Carlos Ruiz]] relieved the team with an equalizer. In the second half Carlos Ruiz scored once more, while [[Mario Rafael Rodr\u00edguez|Mario Rodr\u00edguez]] and youngster [[Jos\u00e9 Manuel Contreras]] also scored and finished the game 4\u20131. With the win, they were able to collect 4 points, putting them in second place due to having a better goal difference than Trinidad and Tobago. The next two matches would be crucial in advancing to the next round. \n\nOn October 11, many fans gathered around the Estadio Mateo Flores to support the national team in their home game against Trinidad and Tobago, heavily expecting a win. Despite being reduced to 10 men, the Soca Warriors were able to hold Guatemala to 0\u20130 stalemate, disgruntling the national team and fans. With hopes of getting a result in Havana four days later, Guatemala were unable to even get a point against Cuba, falling down 1\u20130 by halftime after Jaime Colome scored a penalty. Marco Pappa volleyed in an equalizer in the 80th minute, replenishing the confidence for the team but Urgelles was able to bring Cuba back on top in the 90th minute, complicating the hopes of Guatemala in qualifying for the World Cup with one game to spare. Meanwhile, the Trinidadians defeated the United States 2\u20131 at home, putting them in second place. Maradiaga was fired soon right after and Benjamin Monterroso, a less ambitious coach was appointed, focusing on the upcoming edition of the Copa Uncaf the following January. A 2\u20130 away loss against the US confirmed the elimination of the national team, having finished in third place with 5 points, thus missing out on the World Cup. \n\nAt the Uncaf nations cup, Monterroso wanted to introduce more younger players into the starting line up such as Minor Lopez, Ricardo Jerez and Wilson Lalin but everything backfired after losing both group stage matches against Costa Rica and Panama as well as losing astonishingly 2\u20130 to an inferior Nicaragua team in the play off match for the final berth to attend the next Gold Cup; Minor Lopez was the lone goal scorer for Los Bicolores. As a result, the national team were inactive for the next two years and Benjamin Monterroso shamefully stepped down after two months in charge.\n\n===2014 World Cup cycle===\nOn May 2010, Uruguayan born Paraguayan [[Ever Hugo Almeida]] was appointed as the next coach for Guatemala. At the [[2011 Copa Centroamericana]], formerly known as the \"UNCAF Nations Cup\", Guatemala finished in fifth place, losing to [[Costa Rica national football team|Costa Rica]] 2\u20130 and [[Honduras national football team|Honduras]] 3\u20131. In the fifth place match, they defeated [[Nicaragua national football team|Nicaragua]] 2\u20131 to qualify to the [[2011 CONCACAF Gold Cup|2011 Gold Cup]].\n\nAt the [[2011 CONCACAF Gold Cup|2011 Gold Cup]], Guatemala drew against [[Honduras national football team|Honduras]] 0\u20130 despite being reduced to nine men. In the next match, they suffer a loss against a physically superior [[Jamaica national football team|Jamaica]] 2\u20130 but managed to redeem themselves after having won against [[Grenada national football team|Grenada]] 4\u20130 goals from [[Jos\u00e9 Javier del \u00c1guila]], [[Marco Pappa]], Carlos Ruiz, and Carlos Gallardo. Placing among the best third place, they saw themselves advancing to the quarterfinals, where they lost against the reigning champions [[Mexico national football team|Mexico]] 2\u20131 although a long ball from Elias Vasquez to Carlos Ruiz gave them the lead in the first half.\n\nFor the [[2014 FIFA World Cup qualification (CONCACAF)|2014 World Cup qualifiers]], Guatemala opened the qualifying campaign in the second round by sweeping six wins in six games, advancing to the third round in the same group as [[United States men's national soccer team|USA]], [[Jamaica national football team|Jamaica]] and [[Antigua and Barbuda national football team|Antigua and Barbuda]]. Prior to the start of the third round, three of Guatemala's key players Guillermo Ramirez, Gustavo Cabrera and Yony Flores were sent home during a practice session after teammates Carlos Ruiz and Luis Rodriguez heard of their involvement in money laundering and bribery in fixing multiple fixtures; they were subsequently banned for life in participating in any football competition abroad or domestic.\n\nThe team had a rough start in an away loss to Jamaica with [[Dwight Pezzarossi]] only managing to pull back one goal in stoppage time. In the next match, Guatemala tied at home after Clint Dempsey managed to get a goal for the US, and Marco Pappa's free kick later in the game managed to bring Guatemala one point. For the third game in a row, also at home, the team fell behind against Antigua and Barbuda. In the second half with the Antiguan goalkeeper Molvin James sent off for wasting time, Carlos Ruiz was able to score a brace making the game 2\u20131; an additional goal from Dwight Pezzarossi eventually ended the game 3\u20131. Four days later, a lone goal from Carlos Ruiz sufficed for an away win against Antigua and Barbuda in North Sound.\n\nIn the next fixture, Guatemala beat Jamaica at home 2\u20131. In their last game, a minimum of a draw would be enough to get Guatemala to the final stage of the qualifiers. After taking the lead 1\u20130 in the first five minutes thanks to Carlos Ruiz, the USA team returned the favor by scoring 3 goals to crush their hopes. Guatemala finished ten points behind the [[United States men's national soccer team|USA]] and [[Jamaica national football team|Jamaica]], losing out on goal difference to the Jamaicans.\n\nIn January 2013, still led by [[Ever Almeida]], Guatemala participated in the [[2013 Copa Centroamericana]]. Consisted of mostly youngsters, Guatemala could only manage three draws in their group play (1\u20131 against [[Nicaragua national football team|Nicaragua]], 0\u20130 to border rivals [[Belize national football team|Belize]] and 1\u20131 against [[Costa Rica national football team|Costa Rica]]), losing out to Belize for direct qualification to the Gold Cup. They faced [[Panama national football team|Panama]] in the 5th place match for the final slot in the [[2013 CONCACAF Gold Cup|2013 Gold Cup]] in the United States but lost 3\u20131. Ever Almeida stepped down in favour of technical director [[Victor Hugo Monz\u00f3n]].\n\n===2016 suspension===\nOn Oct 28, 2016, the Guatemalan football federation was suspended indefinitely by FIFA, after the international football governing body had appointed an oversight committee to look into allegations of corruption.<ref>{{cite news | last=Menchu | first=Sofia | title=FIFA suspends Guatemalan soccer federation, citing resistance to oversight | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-soccer-fifa-guatemala-idUSKCN12S2ET | accessdate=2017-07-01 | publisher=Reuters | date=2016-10-28}}</ref> FIFA stated that the Guatemalan federation (FEDEFUT) had rejected the committee's mandate to run FEDEFUT's business, organize elections, and modernize its statutes, and would remain barred from international competition until FEDEFUT ratified an extension of the mandate.<ref>{{cite news | title=Guatemala suspended from international football | url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/soccer-fifa-guatemala-idUKL4N1CY56H | accessdate=2017-07-01 | publisher=Reuters | date=2016-10-28}}</ref>\nThe football team missed their chance on qualifying on the 2017 and 2019 CONCACAF Gold Cup tournaments ([[2017 Copa Centroamericana]] and [[2019\u201320 CONCACAF Nations League qualifying]], respectively) as they missed deadlines to have their suspension lifted.\n\nThe suspension was lifted on May 31, 2018 after FEDEFUT's normalization committee became fully operational.<ref>{{cite web|title=FIFA lifts suspension of Guatemalan Football Association|url=https://www.fifa.com/governance/news/y=2018/m=5/news=fifa-lifts-suspension-of-guatemalan-football-association.html|publisher=[[FIFA]]|date=31 May 2018|accessdate=5 July 2019}}</ref>\n\n==Home stadium==\n{{Main|Estadio Doroteo Guamuch Flores}}\nThe Estadio Nacional Mateo Flores, also known as Coloso de la Zona 5, is a multi-use national stadium in [[Guatemala City]], the largest in [[Guatemala]].

Clinton - NCI Visuals Online.jpg|thumb|220px|'''''L''''' [[phenotype]] of hand clasping<br>([[Bill Clinton]])]]\n'''Hand clasping''' is the superposition of each [[finger]] of one [[hand]] over the corresponding finger of the opposite hand. When clasping the hands, a person tends to interlace the fingers in one of two ways. People who hold the fingers of the right hand above the left fingers are classified as [[phenotype]] ''R'' (right), while those who hold the fingers of the left hand above those of the right are phenotype ''L'' (left).\n\nAlthough some people do not exhibit a preference for one type of hand clasping, most do. Once adopted, the method of hand clasping tends to be consistent throughout life. When an individual attempts to clasp the hands in the opposite configuration from the usual one, that person may feel a sense that something is out of the ordinary.\n\nIt was noted that the ''R'' type occurs more frequently in women than in men, which led to popular speculation that all persons with ''L'' phenotype are more emotional than persons with ''R'' type.{{Dubious|date=February 2016}}<ref>{{cite journal | pmid = 4461659 | doi=10.1159/000152670 | volume=24 | title=Preferences for handedness, arm folding, and hand clasping in families | year=1974 | journal=Hum Hered | pages=345\u201351  | last1 = Ferronato | first1 = S | last2 = Thomas | first2 = D | last3 = Sadava | first3 = D}}</ref>\n\nLai and Walsh (1965) suspect that [[genotype|genetic factors]] are important in determining these characteristics.

Clinton - NCI Visuals Online.jpg|thumb|220px|'''''L''''' [[phenotype]] of hand clasping<br>([[Bill Clinton]])]]\n'''Hand clasping''' is the superposition of each [[finger]] of one [[hand]] over the corresponding finger of the opposite hand. When clasping the hands, a person tends to interlace the fingers in one of two ways. People who hold the fingers of the right hand above the left fingers are classified as [[phenotype]] ''R'' (right), while those who hold the fingers of the left hand above those of the right are phenotype ''L'' (left).\n\nAlthough some people do not exhibit a preference for one type of hand clasping, most do. Once adopted, the method of hand clasping tends to be consistent throughout life. When an individual attempts to clasp the hands in the opposite configuration from the usual one, that person may feel a sense that something is out of the ordinary.\n\nIt was noted that the ''R'' type occurs more frequently in women than in men, which led to popular speculation that all persons with ''L'' phenotype are more emotional than persons with ''R'' type.{{Dubious|date=February 2016}}<ref>Ferronato S., Thomas D., Sadava D.
