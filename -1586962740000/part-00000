{"title_page": "Symphony No. 6 (Ch\u00e1vez)", "text_new": "{{Use Harvard referencing|date=May 2019}}\n[[File:Avery Fisher Hall.jpg|thumb|Philharmonic Hall (today Avery Fisher Hall), Lincoln Center, where Ch\u00e1vez's Sixth Symphony was premiered in 1964]]\n'''Symphony No. 6''' is an orchestral work by [[Carlos Ch\u00e1vez]], composed in 1961\u201362.\n\n==History==\nThe Sixth Symphony was commissioned by the [[New York Philharmonic]] in celebration of their 1962\u201363 opening season in [[Lincoln Center for the Performing Arts]]. Composition was completed in 1962 and a date was scheduled for the symphony's premiere in the spring of 1963, but Ch\u00e1vez continued revisions to the score and the date had to be postponed. It was finally premiered in New York on 7 May 1964 in Philharmonic Hall, Lincoln Center, by [[Leonard Bernstein]] and the New York Philharmonic, to whom the score is dedicated ({{harvnb|Klein|1964}}; {{harvnb|Orb\u00f3n|1987c|loc=80}}).\n\n==Instrumentation==\nThe symphony is scored for piccolo, two flutes, two oboes, cor anglais, two clarinets, two bassoons, contrabassoon, four horns, two trumpets, two trombones, bass trombone, tuba, timpani, percussion (two players), and strings.\n\n==Analysis==\nThe work is in three movements:\n#Allegro energico\n#Adagio molto cantabile\n#Con anima\n\nFar from the experimental approaches Ch\u00e1vez  adopted in his earlier symphonies, the Sixth accepts the classical forms. The first movement is a [[Sonata form|sonata-allegro]], beginning with a C-major theme recalling the symphonic style of the Romantic era. A bitonal transition leads to the second theme, in the dominant key of G. After extensive development, the recapitulation is followed by a developmental coda, including a strict mirror canon on the first theme. The movement fades to nothing in a constant march in [[Tuplet (music)|triplets]] {{harv|Orb\u00f3n|1987c|loc=75\u201377}}.\n\nThe second movement functions as a short but intense interlude between the outer movements. It falls into two sections, the first beginning in the brass and woodwinds, finally giving way to the violins. This is followed, after a descending transitional passage in the low brass, by the second section, where the double basses present the theme that will form the basis of the finale. There is a suggestion of the contrapuntal atmosphere, and even an anticipation of the two counterthemes of the first variation of the following movement {{harv|Orb\u00f3n|1987c|loc=77}}.\n\nThe symphony closes with a magisterial [[passacaglia]]. After the announcement of the bass ostinato in the tuba, there follow thirty-four variations, a [[fugue]] with two expositions, and then a further seven variations to conclude. The twenty-ninth variation evokes a [[Johannes Brahms|Brahmsian]] sound as a culmination, reflecting the illustrious antecedent Ch\u00e1vez has accepted as his model, and the main theme from the first movement returns in the thirtieth. The last statement of the bass theme brings the movement to an imposing close in C major {{harv|Orb\u00f3n|1987c|loc=77\u201378}}.\n\n==Discography==\n* ''The Six Symphonies of Carlos Ch\u00e1vez ''.

He died before the arrival of the Spaniards, and thus, was given mummification and death rites in the traditional way.<ref name=\"youtube.com\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EQDjoNX_Tkw</ref>\n\n===Spanish period===\nThe arrival of Spanish colonizers in Buguias were primarily due to the construction of Spanish trails leading to the mountain region.

He donated it to the [[National Museum of the Philippines]] afterwards for better care of the national treasure. The people of Buguias made diplomatic channels with the National Museum until it was agreed that the National Museum would return the mummy of Apo Anno to its resting place in barangay Nabalicong after Benguet officials agreed to install iron grills in the burial cave and provide funds for its upkeep. Later that year, Apo Anno was returned to its burial cave, through elaborate death rituals last performed in the 16th century and a hero's homecoming conducted by the people of Buguias.<ref name=\"youtube.com\"/>\n\nThere have been scholars campaigning for the declaration of Apo Anno's mummy and resting place as a collective ''National Treasure'' or ''Important Cultural Property'' of the Philippines.\n\n==Geography==\nBuguias is located at {{coord|format=dms}}, at the northeastern section of Benguet.

Hence, there are only THREE official styles! --> [[Swimming (sport)|swimming]] styles used in competitive events regulated by [[FINA]], and the only one of these styles swum on the back. This swimming style has the advantage of easy breathing, but the disadvantage of swimmers not being able to see where they are going. It also has a different start from the other three competition swimming styles. The swimming style is similar to an ''upside down'' [[front crawl]] or freestyle. Both backstroke and front crawl are long-axis strokes. In individual medley backstroke is the second style swum; in the medley relay it is the first style swum. To be completely honest nobody likes backstroke. Also you can't breathe because of the people your racing's kicks and because your splashing yourself when you take your hand out of the water. So in conclusion backstroke is the worst stroke and breaststroke is the best stroke (it even rhymes).\n\n==History==\nBackstroke is an ancient style of swimming, popularized by [[Harry Hebner]].<ref>Katz, Jane and Bruning, id=QlqQYX3Q3pQC&q=history+of+backstroke&dq=history+of+backstroke&hl=en&sa=X&ei=vQhRT5zaB8Wq8APllcDxBQ&ved=0CDcQ6AEwAQ]</ref> It was the second stroke to be swum in competitions after the [[front crawl]]. The first [[Swimming at the Summer Olympics|Olympic]] backstroke competition was the [[Swimming at the 1900 Summer Olympics \u2013 Men's 200 metre backstroke|1900 Paris Olympics men's 200 meter]].<ref name=Lohn>[https://books.google.com/books?id=RWLKhp7HEkMC&pg=PA6&dq=history+of+backstroke&hl=en&sa=X&ei=vQhRT5zaB8Wq8APllcDxBQ&ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=history%20of%20backstroke&f=false Lohn, John ''Historical Dictionary of Competitive Swimming'' p. 6]</ref>\n\n==Technique==\n<!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Backstroke up.jpg|thumb|300px|Upper view of professional backstroke movement]] -->\nIn the initial position, the swimmer performing backstroke lies flat on the back; arms stretched with extended fingertips, and legs extended backwards.\n\n===Arm movement===\n[[File:BackstrokeSwimming.jpg|thumb|300px|left|Backstroke swimming (amateur competition, non-optimal style)]]\nIn backstroke, the arms contribute most of the forward movement. The arm stroke consists of two main parts: the power phase (consisting of three separate parts) and the recovery.<ref name=Montgomery>Montgomery; Chambers, pp. 43-46</ref> The arms alternate so that always one arm is underwater while the other arm is recovering. One complete arm turn is considered one cycle. From the initial position, one arm sinks slightly under water and turns the palm outward to start the catch phase (first part of the power phase). The hand enters downward (pinkie finger first) then pulling out at a 45 degree angle, catching the water.\n\nDuring the power phase the hand follows a semi-circular path from the catch to the side of the hip. The palm is always facing away from the swimming direction, while remaining straight as an extension of the arm, and the elbow always points downward towards the bottom of the pool. This is done so that both the arms and the elbow can push the maximum amount of water back in order to push the body forward. At the height of the shoulders, the upper and lower arms should have their maximum angle of about 90 degrees. This is called the Mid-Pull of the power phase.\n\nThe Mid-Pull phase consists of pushing the palm of the hand as far down as possible with the fingers pointing upward. Again, the goal is to push the body forward against the water. At the very end of the Mid-Pull, the palm flaps down for a last push forward down to a depth of 45&nbsp;cm, creating the finish of the power phase. Besides pushing the body forward, this also helps with the rolling back to the other side as part of the body movement. During the power phase, the fingers of the hand can be slightly apart, as this will increase the resistance of the hand in the water due to [[turbulence]].\n\nTo prepare for the recovery phase, the hand is rotated so that the palms point towards the legs and the thumb side points upwards. At the beginning of the recovery phase of the one arm, the other arm begins its power phase. The recovering arm is moved in a semicircle straight over the shoulders to the front. During this recovery, the palm rotates so that the small finger enters the water first, allowing for the least amount of resistance, and the palms point outward. After a short gliding phase, the cycle repeats with the preparation for the next power phase.\n<gallery>\nFile:Backstroke.gif|\nFile:Backstroke2.gif|\nFile:Backstroke3.gif|\n</gallery>\n\n====Variants====\nA variant is to move both arms synchronized and not alternating, similar to an upside down [[breast stroke]]. This is easier to coordinate, and the peak speed during the combined power phase is faster, yet the speed is much slower during the combined recovery. The average speed will usually be less than the average speed of the alternating stroke. This stroke is commonly called the elementary backstroke. This elementary backstroke swim was used in the 1900 and 1908 Olympics. The backcrawl swim supplanted the elementary backstroke swim after 1908 as the competitive back swim and it is now the referred to as the backstroke.\n\nAnother variant is the old style of swimming backstroke, where the arm movement formed a complete circle in a windmill type pattern. However, this style is not commonly used for competitive swimming, as a lot of energy is spent on pushing the body up and down instead of forward. Furthermore, the added strain on the [[shoulder]] is considered less than ideal and can lead to injuries.\n\nIt is also possible to move only one arm at a time (paused stroke), where one arm moves through the power and recovery phases while the other arm rests. This is slow, but it is used frequently to teach students the movement, as they have to concentrate on only one arm. This drill technique can work well with the swimmer holding a float, however it is important not to overuse this drill as a \"paused stroke\" can easily become habitual and can be challenging to unlearn. \n\n===Leg movement===\nThe leg movement in backstroke is similar to the flutter kick in front crawl. The kick makes a large contribution to the forward speed, while significantly stabilizing the body.\n\nThe leg stroke alternates, with one leg sinking down straight to about 30 degrees. From this position, the leg makes a fast kick upward, slightly bending the knee at the beginning and then stretching it again in the horizontal. However, there are also frequent variants with four or only two kicks per cycle. Usually, sprinters tend to use 6 kicks per cycle, whereas long distance swimmer may use fewer.<ref name=Montgomery/>\n[[File:Amateur Swimming Backstroke.jpg|thumb|Amateur Swimming Backstroke]]\n\n====Variants====\nIt is also possible to use a butterfly kick, although this is rare except after the initial start and after turns. The dolphin kick is essential for many top athletes because it is the fastest part of the race. It may also constitute the majority of the race (i.e., in the 100 yard backstroke the swimmer may kick underwater dolphin for 15 yards per length which equates to as much as 60 yards kicking in a 100 yd race). A great example of this is Olympic gold medallist [[Natalie Coughlin]]. Breaststroke kicks are most comfortable if the arms are used synchronized, as the breaststroke kick makes it more difficult to compensate for the rolling movement with alternating arm cycles. The butterfly kick can be done slightly to one side depending on the rolling motion of the body.\n\n===Breathing===\nBreathing in backstroke is easier than in other strokes, as the mouth and nose are usually above water. Competitive swimmers breathe in through the mouth during the recovery of one arm, and breathe out through the mouth and nose during the pull and push phase of the same arm. This is done to clear the nose of water.\n\n===Body movement===\nDue to the asynchronous movement of the arms, the body tends to roll around its long axis. By taking advantage of this rolling motion, swimmers can increase their effectiveness while swimming backstroke. The overall position of the body is straight in the horizontal to reduce drag. Beginners frequently let their posterior and thighs sink too low, which increases drag. To avoid this, the upper legs have to be moved to the extreme down position at each kick even with a little help by the back and the foot tips have to be fixed in the extreme lower position and the head is held out of the water to act as a counter-weight.\n\n===Start===\n[[File:BackstrokeStart.JPG|thumb|Backstroke start, waiting for the signal]]\nThe backstroke start is the only start from the water.<ref name=Lohn/> The swimmer faces the wall and grabs part of the start block or the wall with their hands. Ideally, there are grips on the block for this purpose. The legs are placed shoulder width apart on the wall with both heels slightly off the wall. Just before the starting signal, the swimmer pulls their head closer to the start block, while keeping the knees bent at a 90-degree angle. Some swimmers prefer to keep one foot slightly lower than the other during the start.\n\nFor the takeoff, the swimmer pushes his or her hands away from the block and swings his or her arms around sideways to the front. At the same time, the swimmer throws his or her head to the back. The swimmer then pushes away from the wall with his or her feet. Ideally, the swimmer's back is arched during the airborne phase so that only the feet and the hands touch the water while the rest of the body is above the water line. This reduces drag and permits a faster start. On September 21, 2005, FINA modified the backstroke start rule regarding toes below the water line. The feet can now be above the water, but not above or curled over the lip of the pool gutter.\n\nAfter the start, the swimmer is completely underwater. Due to increased resistance at the surface, experienced swimmers usually swim faster underwater than at the surface. Therefore, most experienced swimmers in backstroke competitions stay under water up to the limit set by FINA (15 meters after the start and after every turn). Most swimmers use a butterfly kick underwater, as this provides more forward movement than the flutter kick. The underwater phase includes the risk of water entering the nose, so most swimmers breathe out through the nose to stop water from entering.\n\nThe swimmer's head must break the surface before 15 m under FINA rules. The swimmer starts swimming with one arm, followed by the other arm with half a cycle delay. The swimmer continues in regular swimming style, staying on the back for the entire time except the turns.\n\n===Turn and finish===\n[[File:Swimmer doing the backstroke.jpg|thumb|A swimmer focuses on the ceiling while doing the backstroke.]]\nApproaching the wall has the problem that the swimmer cannot see where he or she is going. Most competitive swimmers know how many strokes they need for a lane, or at least how many strokes after the signal flags or the change in color of the separating lines. Turning the head is also possible, but slows the swimmer down.\n\nPrior to September 1992 swimmers had to touch the wall on their back before initiating the turn or rolling off their back in order to turn. After September 1992 when approaching the wall, the swimmer is allowed to turn to his or her breast and make one push/pull phase with one arm or simultaneous double arm pull. Next, the swimmer makes half a tumble turn forward, resting the feet against the wall. The arms are in the forward position at this time, and the swimmer pushes their body off the wall. Similar to the start, the swimmer can remain up to 15 m under water, with most swimmers using a butterfly kick for speed.  This rule change allowed for faster turns.\n\nFor the finish, the swimmer must touch the wall while lying on their back, less than 90 degrees out of the horizontal, and must not be completely submerged.\n\n==Competitions==\n[[File:Backstroke start at 2008 EC.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Backstroke start at [[2008 European Aquatics Championships|2008 Euros]].]]\n\nThere are three common distances swum in competitive backstroke swimming, both over either a long course (50 m pool) or a short course (25 m pool).<ref>Stubbs, Ray ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=_KeudOtjOkQC&pg=PT240&dq=50m+backstroke+100m+backstroke+200m+backstroke&hl=en&sa=X&ei=mj1ST9SLCYfx8QOnhqHvBQ&ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=50m%20backstroke%20100m%20backstroke%20200m%20backstroke&f=false  The Sports book]'' p. 238</ref> The United States also employs short course yards (25 yard pool).\n* 50 m backstroke\n* 100 m backstroke\n* 200 m backstroke\nOther distances are also swum on occasions.\n\nBackstroke is also part of the [[Medley swimming|medley]] over the following distances:\n* 100 m individual medley (short course 25 m pool only)\n* 200 m individual medley\n* 400 m individual medley\n* 4 \u00d7 100 m medley relay\n\nBelow are the official FINA rules which apply to swimmers during official competitions.\n* Before the starting signal, the swimmers shall line up in the water facing the starting end, with both hands holding the starting grips. Standing in or on the gutter or bending the toes over the lip of the gutter is prohibited.\n* At the signal for starting and after turning, the swimmer shall push off and swim upon his back throughout the race except when executing a turn as set forth in SW 6.4. The normal position on the back can include a roll movement of the body up to, but not including 90 degrees from horizontal. The position of the head is not relevant.\n* Some part of the swimmer must break the surface of the water throughout the race. It shall be permissible for the swimmer to be completely submerged during the turn, and for a distance of not more than 15 meters after the start and each turn. By that point, the head must have broken the surface.\n* During the turn, the shoulders may be turned over the vertical to the breast after which a continuous single arm pull or a continuous simultaneous double arm pull may be used to initiate the turn. Once the body has left the position on the back, any kick or arm pull must be part of the continuous turning action. The swimmer must have returned to the position on the back upon leaving the wall. When executing the turn there must be a touch of the wall with some part of the swimmer's body.\n* Upon the finish of the race, the swimmer must touch the wall while on the back in his/her respective lane. Competitive swimmers frequently swing their arm back and down into the water, bringing the head and upper body with it. This creates a large amount of forward momentum into the wall. A single dolphin kick can be used to keep the some part of the swimmer above water, and therefore, legal.\n\n== Olympic and long course world champions in backstroke ==\n\n=== Men ===\n{{Footer Olympic Champions 100 m Backstroke Men}}\n{{Footer Olympic Champions 200 m Backstroke Men}}\n{{Footer World LC Champions 50m Backstroke Men}}\n{{Footer World LC Champions 100m Backstroke Men}}\n{{Footer World LC Champions 200m Backstroke Men}}\n\n=== Women ===\n{{Footer Olympic Champions 100 m Backstroke Women}}\n{{Footer Olympic Champions 200 m Backstroke Women}}\n{{Footer World LC Champions 50m Backstroke Women}}\n{{Footer World LC Champions 100m Backstroke Women}}\n{{Footer World LC Champions 200m Backstroke Women}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of world records in swimming]]\n* [[Victory backstroke]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n;Bibliography\n{{cite book |title=Mastering swimming |last=Montgomery |first=Jim |last2=Montgomery |first2=James P. |last3=Chambers |first3=Mo |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2009 |publisher= |location= |isbn=978-0-7360-7453-7 |page= |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VQk-kt-ckF4C&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false |accessdate=}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Backstroke}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20121226031151/http://www.swim.ee/models/models.html Swim.ee]: Detailed discussion of swimming techniques and speeds\n* [http://www.usaswimming.org/ViewMiscArticle.aspx?TabId=1596&Alias=Rainbow&Lang=en&mid=196&ItemId=3074 Backstroke Start]: USA Swimming backstroke start\n\n{{Swimming styles}}\n\n[[Category:Backstroke]]\n[[Category:Swimming styles]]\n\n[[he:\u05e9\u05d7\u05d9\u05d9\u05d4 \u05ea\u05d7\u05e8\u05d5\u05ea\u05d9\u05ea#\u05d2\u05d1]]\n", "text_old": "{{about|the swimming style|the typographical mark|Backslash}}\n{{More citations needed|date=March 2012}}\n[[File:Gordan Kozulj Croatia backstroke EC.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Gordan Ko\u017eulj]] swimming backstroke at [[2008 European Aquatics Championships|2008 Euros]]]] \n'''Backstroke''' or '''back crawl''' is one of the four<!--Freestyle is NOT an official style, but rather \"ANY\" style!

Ideally, there are grips on the block for this purpose. The legs are placed shoulder width apart on the wall with both heels slightly off the wall. Just before the starting signal, the swimmer pulls their head closer to the start block, while keeping the knees bent at a 90-degree angle. Some swimmers prefer to keep one foot slightly lower than the other during the start.\n\nFor the takeoff, the swimmer pushes his or her hands away from the block and swings his or her arms around sideways to the front. At the same time, the swimmer throws his or her head to the back. The swimmer then pushes away from the wall with his or her feet. Ideally, the swimmer's back is arched during the airborne phase so that only the feet and the hands touch the water while the rest of the body is above the water line. This reduces drag and permits a faster start. On September 21, 2005, FINA modified the backstroke start rule regarding toes below the water line. The feet can now be above the water, but not above or curled over the lip of the pool gutter.\n\nAfter the start, the swimmer is completely underwater. Due to increased resistance at the surface, experienced swimmers usually swim faster underwater than at the surface. Therefore, most experienced swimmers in backstroke competitions stay under water up to the limit set by FINA (15 meters after the start and after every turn). Most swimmers use a butterfly kick underwater, as this provides more forward movement than the flutter kick. The underwater phase includes the risk of water entering the nose, so most swimmers breathe out through the nose to stop water from entering.\n\nThe swimmer's head must break the surface before 15 m under FINA rules. The swimmer starts swimming with one arm, followed by the other arm with half a cycle delay. The swimmer continues in regular swimming style, staying on the back for the entire time except the turns.\n\n===Turn and finish===\n[[File:Swimmer doing the backstroke.jpg|thumb|A swimmer focuses on the ceiling while doing the backstroke.]]\nApproaching the wall has the problem that the swimmer cannot see where he or she is going. Most competitive swimmers know how many strokes they need for a lane, or at least how many strokes after the signal flags or the change in color of the separating lines. Turning the head is also possible, but slows the swimmer down.\n\nPrior to September 1992 swimmers had to touch the wall on their back before initiating the turn or rolling off their back in order to turn. After September 1992 when approaching the wall, the swimmer is allowed to turn to his or her breast and make one push/pull phase with one arm or simultaneous double arm pull. Next, the swimmer makes half a tumble turn forward, resting the feet against the wall. The arms are in the forward position at this time, and the swimmer pushes their body off the wall. Similar to the start, the swimmer can remain up to 15 m under water, with most swimmers using a butterfly kick for speed.  This rule change allowed for faster turns.\n\nFor the finish, the swimmer must touch the wall while lying on their back, less than 90 degrees out of the horizontal, and must not be completely submerged.\n\n==Competitions==\n[[File:Backstroke start at 2008 EC.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Backstroke start at [[2008 European Aquatics Championships|2008 Euros]].]]\n\nThere are three common distances swum in competitive backstroke swimming, both over either a long course (50 m pool) or a short course (25 m pool).<ref>Stubbs, Ray ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=_KeudOtjOkQC&pg=PT240&dq=50m+backstroke+100m+backstroke+200m+backstroke&hl=en&sa=X&ei=mj1ST9SLCYfx8QOnhqHvBQ&ved=0CDEQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&q=50m%20backstroke%20100m%20backstroke%20200m%20backstroke&f=false  The Sports book]'' p. 238</ref> The United States also employs short course yards (25 yard pool).\n* 50 m backstroke\n* 100 m backstroke\n* 200 m backstroke\nOther distances are also swum on occasions.\n\nBackstroke is also part of the [[Medley swimming|medley]] over the following distances:\n* 100 m individual medley (short course 25 m pool only)\n* 200 m individual medley\n* 400 m individual medley\n* 4 \u00d7 100 m medley relay\n\nBelow are the official FINA rules which apply to swimmers during official competitions.\n* Before the starting signal, the swimmers shall line up in the water facing the starting end, with both hands holding the starting grips. Standing in or on the gutter or bending the toes over the lip of the gutter is prohibited.\n* At the signal for starting and after turning, the swimmer shall push off and swim upon his back throughout the race except when executing a turn as set forth in SW 6.4. The normal position on the back can include a roll movement of the body up to, but not including 90 degrees from horizontal. The position of the head is not relevant.\n* Some part of the swimmer must break the surface of the water throughout the race. It shall be permissible for the swimmer to be completely submerged during the turn, and for a distance of not more than 15 meters after the start and each turn. By that point, the head must have broken the surface.\n* During the turn, the shoulders may be turned over the vertical to the breast after which a continuous single arm pull or a continuous simultaneous double arm pull may be used to initiate the turn. Once the body has left the position on the back, any kick or arm pull must be part of the continuous turning action. The swimmer must have returned to the position on the back upon leaving the wall. When executing the turn there must be a touch of the wall with some part of the swimmer's body.\n* Upon the finish of the race, the swimmer must touch the wall while on the back in his/her respective lane. Competitive swimmers frequently swing their arm back and down into the water, bringing the head and upper body with it. This creates a large amount of forward momentum into the wall. A single dolphin kick can be used to keep the some part of the swimmer above water, and therefore, legal.\n\n== Olympic and long course world champions in backstroke ==\n\n=== Men ===\n{{Footer Olympic Champions 100 m Backstroke Men}}\n{{Footer Olympic Champions 200 m Backstroke Men}}\n{{Footer World LC Champions 50m Backstroke Men}}\n{{Footer World LC Champions 100m Backstroke Men}}\n{{Footer World LC Champions 200m Backstroke Men}}\n\n=== Women ===\n{{Footer Olympic Champions 100 m Backstroke Women}}\n{{Footer Olympic Champions 200 m Backstroke Women}}\n{{Footer World LC Champions 50m Backstroke Women}}\n{{Footer World LC Champions 100m Backstroke Women}}\n{{Footer World LC Champions 200m Backstroke Women}}\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of world records in swimming]]\n* [[Victory backstroke]]\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n;Bibliography\n{{cite book |title=Mastering swimming |last=Montgomery |first=Jim |last2=Montgomery |first2=James P. |last3=Chambers |first3=Mo |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=2009 |publisher= |location= |isbn=978-0-7360-7453-7 |page= |pages= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VQk-kt-ckF4C&printsec=frontcover&source=gbs_ge_summary_r&cad=0#v=onepage&q&f=false |accessdate=}}\n\n==External links==\n{{commons category|Backstroke}}\n* [https://web.archive.org/web/20121226031151/http://www.swim.ee/models/models.html Swim.ee]: Detailed discussion of swimming techniques and speeds\n* [http://www.usaswimming.org/ViewMiscArticle.aspx?TabId=1596&Alias=Rainbow&Lang=en&mid=196&ItemId=3074 Backstroke Start]: USA Swimming backstroke start\n\n{{Swimming styles}}\n\n[[Category:Backstroke]]\n[[Category:Swimming styles]]\n\n[[he:\u05e9\u05d7\u05d9\u05d9\u05d4 \u05ea\u05d7\u05e8\u05d5\u05ea\u05d9\u05ea#\u05d2\u05d1]]\n", "name_user": "Mrjonesy1123", "label": "safe", "comment": "conclusion of backstroke", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Backstroke"}

It was directed by [[Sam Raimi]] from a screenplay by Raimi, his older brother [[Ivan Raimi|Ivan]] and [[Alvin Sargent]]. It is the third and final installment in Raimi's [[Spider-Man in film#Sam Raimi films|''Spider-Man'' trilogy]]. The film stars [[Tobey Maguire]] as Peter Parker / Spider-Man, alongside [[Kirsten Dunst]], [[James Franco]], [[Thomas Haden Church]], [[Topher Grace]], [[Bryce Dallas Howard]], [[James Cromwell]], [[Rosemary Harris]] and [[J. K. Simmons]]. Set shortly after the events of ''[[Spider-Man 2]]'', as [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]] prepares his future with [[Mary Jane Watson]], he bonds with an extraterrestrial [[Symbiote (comics)|symbiote]], bringing out his anger while facing three villains: [[Uncle Ben]]'s true killer, Flint Marko, who becomes the [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]] after a freak accident; [[Harry Osborn]], who seeks to avenge his [[Norman Osborn|father]]; and [[Eddie Brock]], a rival photographer who becomes [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]] after acquiring Peter's symbiote.\n\nDevelopment of ''Spider-Man 3'' began immediately after the release of ''Spider-Man 2'' for a 2007 release. During pre-production, Raimi originally wanted another villain to be included along with Sandman. At the request of producer [[Avi Arad]], he added [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]] and the producers also requested the addition of [[Gwen Stacy]]. [[Principal photography]] for the film began in January 2006, and took place in [[Los Angeles]] and [[Cleveland]] before moving to [[New York City]] from May until July 2006. Additional pick-up shots were made after August and the film wrapped in October 2006. During post-production, [[Sony Pictures Imageworks]] created over 900 [[visual effects]] shots. With an estimated production budget of $258 million, it was the [[List of most expensive films|most expensive film ever made]] at the time of its release.\n\n''Spider-Man 3'' premiered on April 16, 2007, in Tokyo, and was released in the United States in both conventional and [[IMAX]] theaters on May 4, 2007. The film grossed $890.9 million worldwide, making it the highest-grossing film of the trilogy, the [[2007 in film#Highest-grossing films|third-highest-grossing film of 2007]] and was the [[List of highest-grossing films#Highest grossing franchises and film series|highest-grossing ''Spider-Man'' film]] until it was surpassed by ''[[Spider-Man: Far From Home|Spider-Man: Far From Home]]'' in 2019. Unlike the previous installments, ''Spider-Man 3'' received a mixed reception from critics, who praised the performances, visual effects and action sequences, but criticized the overloaded storylines and [[subplot]]s and overabundance of villains. The majority of these issues were later attributed to studio interferences and creative differences between Sony, Raimi and Arad.\n\nA fourth installment, titled ''Spider-Man 4'', was set to be released on May 6, 2011, followed by a ''Venom'' spin-off film, but both were cancelled due to Raimi's withdrawal over creative differences with the writers and producers. The ''Spider-Man'' film series was rebooted twice; first with ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man (2012 film)|The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' (2012) by [[Marc Webb]] and starring [[Andrew Garfield]]; and later a new film series set within the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]], directed by [[Jon Watts]] and starring [[Tom Holland (actor)|Tom Holland]], beginning with ''[[Spider-Man: Homecoming]]'' (2017). The ''Venom'' spin-off was revived in 2016 by Sony and was finally released in 2018 with ''[[Venom (2018 film)|Venom]]'', set within [[Sony's Marvel Universe]] directed by [[Ruben Fleischer]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per [[WP:FILMPLOT]], plot summaries for featured films are set between 400-700 words. -->\nA year after the events of the previous film, [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]] plans to propose to [[Mary Jane Watson]], who has just made her [[Broadway musical]] debut. Later, a meteorite lands at [[Central Park]], and an extraterrestrial [[Symbiote (comics)|symbiote]] follows Peter to his apartment. [[Harry Osborn]], seeking vengeance after his father's death and having taken the performance-enhancing gas, attacks Peter with his [[Norman Osborn|father]]'s [[Green Goblin]] technology, but the battle ends with Harry unconscious and with [[amnesia]], erasing his memory of Peter as Spider-Man. Meanwhile, police pursue escaped convict Flint Marko, who visits his wife and dying daughter before fleeing again. Falling into an experimental particle accelerator that fuses his [[DNA]] with the surrounding sand, he transforms into the [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]], who can control sand and reform his body with it.\n\nDuring a festival honoring Spider-Man for saving [[Gwen Stacy]]'s life, he kisses Gwen, infuriating Mary Jane. Meanwhile, Marko robs an armored car, subduing Spider-Man while escaping. [[NYPD]] Captain [[George Stacy]], Gwen's father, informs Peter and his aunt [[Aunt May|May]] that Marko was the true killer of Peter's uncle [[Uncle Ben|Ben]]; the deceased [[Burglar (comics)|Dennis Carradine]] had been Marko's accomplice. In his apartment, while Peter sleeps in his Spider-Man suit to wait for Flint, the symbiote assimilates the suit; Peter later awakens atop a building, discovering his costume has changed and his powers are enhanced; however, the symbiote brings out Peter's darker side and emotions. Spider-Man locates Marko and battles him in a subway tunnel. Discovering that water is Marko's weakness, Spider-Man destroys the pipe, causing its water to reduce Marko to mud and wash him away.\n\nPeter's changed personality alienates Mary Jane, whose career is floundering after she has been fired from her show. She shares a tender moment with Harry, but leaves afterward in regret. Harry recovers from his amnesia and, urged by a hallucination of his father, blackmails Mary Jane into breaking up with Peter. After Mary Jane tells Peter she loves \"somebody else,\" Harry meets with Peter and claims to be that person. Peter confronts Harry over this and spitefully tells Harry his father never loved him. Another fight ensues, with Harry throwing a pumpkin bomb at Peter, who deflects it back, disfiguring Harry's face.\n\nAt the ''[[Daily Bugle]]'', Peter exposes rival freelance photographer [[Eddie Brock]], who had falsified photos to depict Spider-Man as a criminal. Publisher [[J. Jonah Jameson]] fires Brock and makes Peter a staff photographer. Later, to make Mary Jane jealous, Peter brings Gwen to a nightclub where Mary Jane now works. Realizing this, Gwen leaves the nightclub while Peter attacks bouncers and accidentally hits Mary Jane. Peter realizes the symbiote is corrupting him and retreats to a church's bell tower where, upon realizing high-pitched sounds weakens the creature, he removes the symbiote. The symbiote bonds with Brock, transforming him into [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]]. Brock/Venom locates Marko, who survived being washed away, and convinces him to join forces to defeat Spider-Man.\n\nBrock kidnaps Mary Jane and holds her as bait from a web high in a construction site, while Marko keeps police at bay. After Harry refuses to help Peter, he finally learns the truth about his father's death from his butler. While Peter battles Brock and Marko, Harry arrives to help him with his Green Goblin technology. Brock attempts to impale Peter with Harry's [[glider (aircraft)|glider]], but Harry jumps in and is impaled himself. Remembering the symbiote's weakness, Peter assembles a perimeter of metal pipes to create a sonic attack, weakening it and allowing Peter to separate Brock from the symbiote. He activates a pumpkin grenade from Harry's glider and throws it at the symbiote. However, Brock, who became addicted to the symbiote's influence, leaps into the symbiote in an attempt to save it, and gets killed along with the symbiote.\n\nAfterward, Marko explains that Ben's death was an accident that has haunted Marko ever since. Peter forgives him, and Marko turns into a cloud of sand and peacefully flies away. Harry subsequently dies from his injuries. Following Harry's funeral, Peter and Mary Jane reconcile and share a dance.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Tobey Maguire]] as [[Spider-Man (Sam Raimi film series)|Peter Parker / Spider-Man]]: A superhero, a brilliant [[physics]] student at [[Columbia University]], and photographer for the ''Daily Bugle''.

It was directed by [[Sam Raimi]] from a screenplay by Raimi, his older brother [[Ivan Raimi|Ivan]] and [[Alvin Sargent]]. It is the third and final installment in Raimi's [[Spider-Man in film#Sam Raimi films|''Spider-Man'' trilogy]]. The film stars [[Tobey Maguire]] as Peter Parker / Spider-Man, alongside [[Kirsten Dunst]], [[James Franco]], [[Thomas Haden Church]], [[Topher Grace]], [[Bryce Dallas Howard]], [[James Cromwell]], [[Rosemary Harris]] and [[J. K. Simmons]]. Set shortly after the events of ''[[Spider-Man 2]]'', as [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]] prepares his future with [[Mary Jane Watson]], he bonds with an extraterrestrial [[Symbiote (comics)|symbiote]], bringing out his anger while facing three villains: [[Uncle Ben]]'s true killer, Flint Marko, who becomes the [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]] after a freak accident; [[Harry Osborn]], who seeks to avenge his [[Norman Osborn|father]]; and [[Eddie Brock]], a rival photographer who becomes [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]] after acquiring Peter's symbiote.\n\nDevelopment of ''Spider-Man 3'' began immediately after the release of ''Spider-Man 2'' for a 2007 release. During pre-production, Raimi originally wanted another villain to be included along with Sandman. At the request of producer [[Avi Arad]], he added [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]] and the producers also requested the addition of [[Gwen Stacy]]. [[Principal photography]] for the film began in January 2006, and took place in [[Los Angeles]] and [[Cleveland]] before moving to [[New York City]] from May until July 2006. Additional pick-up shots were made after August and the film wrapped in October 2006. During post-production, [[Sony Pictures Imageworks]] created over 900 [[visual effects]] shots. With an estimated production budget of $258 million, it was the [[List of most expensive films|most expensive film ever made]] at the time of its release.\n\n''Spider-Man 3'' premiered on April 16, 2007, in Tokyo, and was released in the United States in both conventional and [[IMAX]] theaters on May 4, 2007. The film grossed $890.9 million worldwide, making it the highest-grossing film of the trilogy, the [[2007 in film#Highest-grossing films|third-highest-grossing film of 2007]] and was the [[List of highest-grossing films#Highest grossing franchises and film series|highest-grossing ''Spider-Man'' film]] until it was surpassed by ''[[Spider-Man: Far From Home|Spider-Man: Far From Home]]'' in 2019. Unlike the previous installments, ''Spider-Man 3'' received a mixed reception from critics, who praised the performances, visual effects and action sequences, but criticized the overloaded storylines and [[subplot]]s and overabundance of villains. The majority of these issues were later attributed to studio interferences and creative differences between Sony, Raimi and Arad.\n\nA fourth installment, titled ''Spider-Man 4'', was set to be released on May 6, 2011, followed by a ''Venom'' spin-off film, but both were cancelled due to Raimi's withdrawal over creative differences with the writers and producers. The ''Spider-Man'' film series was rebooted twice; first with ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man (2012 film)|The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' (2012) by [[Marc Webb]] and starring [[Andrew Garfield]]; and later a new film series set within the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]], directed by [[Jon Watts]] and starring [[Tom Holland (actor)|Tom Holland]], beginning with ''[[Spider-Man: Homecoming]]'' (2017). The ''Venom'' spin-off was revived in 2016 by Sony and was finally released in 2018 with ''[[Venom (2018 film)|Venom]]'', set within [[Sony's Marvel Universe]] directed by [[Ruben Fleischer]].\n\n==Plot==\n<!-- Per [[WP:FILMPLOT]], plot summaries for featured films are set between 400-700 words. -->\nA year after the events of the previous film, [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]] plans to propose to [[Mary Jane Watson]], who has just made her [[Broadway musical]] debut. Later, a meteorite lands at [[Central Park]], and an extraterrestrial [[Symbiote (comics)|symbiote]] follows Peter to his apartment. [[Harry Osborn]], seeking vengeance after his father's death and having taken the performance-enhancing gas, attacks Peter with his [[Norman Osborn|father]]'s [[Green Goblin]] technology, but the battle ends with Harry unconscious and with [[amnesia]], erasing his memory of Peter as Spider-Man. Meanwhile, police pursue escaped convict Flint Marko, who visits his wife and dying daughter before fleeing again. Falling into an experimental particle accelerator that fuses his [[DNA]] with the surrounding sand, he transforms into the [[Sandman (Marvel Comics)|Sandman]], who can control sand and reform his body with it.\n\nDuring a festival honoring Spider-Man for saving [[Gwen Stacy]]'s life, he kisses Gwen, infuriating Mary Jane. Meanwhile, Marko robs an armored car, subduing Spider-Man while escaping. [[NYPD]] Captain [[George Stacy]], Gwen's father, informs Peter and his aunt [[Aunt May|May]] that Marko was the true killer of Peter's uncle [[Uncle Ben|Ben]]; the deceased [[Burglar (comics)|Dennis Carradine]] had been Marko's accomplice. In his apartment, while Peter sleeps in his Spider-Man suit to wait for Flint, the symbiote assimilates the suit; Peter later awakens atop a building, discovering his costume has changed and his powers are enhanced; however, the symbiote brings out Peter's darker side and emotions. Spider-Man locates Marko and battles him in a subway tunnel. Discovering that water is Marko's weakness, Spider-Man destroys the pipe, causing its water to reduce Marko to mud and wash him away.\n\nPeter's changed personality alienates Mary Jane, whose career is floundering after she has been fired from her show. She shares a tender moment with Harry, but leaves afterward in regret. Harry recovers from his amnesia and, urged by a hallucination of his father, blackmails Mary Jane into breaking up with Peter. After Mary Jane tells Peter she loves \"somebody else,\" Harry meets with Peter and claims to be that person. Peter confronts Harry over this and spitefully tells Harry his father never loved him. Another fight ensues, with Harry throwing a pumpkin bomb at Peter, who deflects it back, disfiguring Harry's face.\n\nAt the ''[[Daily Bugle]]'', Peter exposes rival freelance photographer [[Eddie Brock]], who had falsified photos to depict Spider-Man as a criminal. Publisher [[J. Jonah Jameson]] fires Brock and makes Peter a staff photographer. Later, to make Mary Jane jealous, Peter brings Gwen to a nightclub where Mary Jane now works. Realizing this, Gwen leaves the nightclub while Peter attacks bouncers and accidentally hits Mary Jane. Peter realizes the symbiote is corrupting him and retreats to a church's bell tower where, upon realizing high-pitched sounds weakens the creature, he removes the symbiote. The symbiote bonds with Brock, transforming him into [[Venom (Marvel Comics character)|Venom]]. Brock/Venom locates Marko, who survived being washed away, and convinces him to join forces to defeat Spider-Man.\n\nBrock kidnaps Mary Jane and holds her as bait from a web high in a construction site, while Marko keeps police at bay. After Harry refuses to help Peter, he finally learns the truth about his father's death from his butler. While Peter battles Brock and Marko, Harry arrives to help him with his Green Goblin technology. Brock attempts to impale Peter with Harry's [[glider (aircraft)|glider]], but Harry jumps in and is impaled himself. Remembering the symbiote's weakness, Peter assembles a perimeter of metal pipes to create a sonic attack, weakening it and allowing Peter to separate Brock from the symbiote. He activates a pumpkin grenade from Harry's glider and throws it at the symbiote. However, Brock, who became addicted to the symbiote's influence, leaps into the symbiote in an attempt to save it, and gets killed along with the symbiote.\n\nAfterward, Marko explains that Ben's death was an accident that has haunted Marko ever since. Peter forgives him, and Marko turns into a cloud of sand and peacefully flies away. Harry subsequently dies from his injuries. Following Harry's funeral, Peter and Mary Jane reconcile and share a dance.\n\n==Cast==\n* [[Tobey Maguire]] as [[Spider-Man (Sam Raimi film series)|Peter Parker / Spider-Man]]: A superhero, a brilliant [[physics]] student at [[Columbia University]], and photographer for the ''Daily Bugle''.
