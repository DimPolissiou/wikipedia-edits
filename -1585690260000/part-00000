The island has one road connection to the mainland, via [[Washington State Route 532|State Route 532]] over the [[Camano Gateway Bridge]] at the northeast end of the island, connecting to the city of [[Stanwood, Washington|Stanwood]].\n\nThe island has a total area of {{convert|39.77|sqmi|sqkm}}, making it one of the largest in the state of Washington. It has a year-round population of 15,661 as of the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]. The population peaks at over 17,000 during the summer months due to the presence of \"[[snowbird (people)|snowbirds]]\" and other part-time residents with vacation homes on the island. It is an [[unincorporated area]] with several small communities and shares civic facilities with nearby Stanwood, including its [[school district]], [[post office]], and emergency services.\n\nCamano Island is home to two state parks, [[Cama Beach State Park|Cama Beach]] and [[Camano Island State Park]], and several county and local parks.\n\n==History==\n\n===Etymology===\n\nCamano Island was named in 1790 for the [[Spain|Spanish]] explorer [[Jacinto Caama\u00f1o]] by compatriot [[Francisco de Eliza]], who mapped [[Admiralty Inlet]].<ref name=\"Meany\">{{cite book |last=Meany |first=Edmond S. |authorlink=Edmond S.

The switch from production of workers to production of future foundresses ([[gyne]]s) is not utterly abrupt, as has been considered the case for other species of ''Polistes''.\n\nThe colony disperses in the late summer, with only males and future foundresses produced instead of workers, and individuals frequently cluster in groups (called a [[Hibernaculum (zoology)|hibernaculum]]) to overwinter. Hibernation does not usually take place on former nest sites.\n\n[[File:Wasp March 2008-1.jpg|thumb|Paper wasp with regurgitated [[nectar]]]]\n\nSocial hierarchies established within the colony can also influence individual ''P. dominula''{{'}}s longevity. Queens live longer than the males or the workers because the workers protect the queens from predators. The queen starts laying eggs in late March or early April, immediately after the \"founding phase\" of the newly built nest. Then, the colony disperses in the late summer, with only males and future foundresses produced instead of workers. Although individuals frequently cluster in groups (to overwinter), neither most nonreproductive males nor nonreproductive females survive the winter because their lifespans are shorter than a year (around 11 months) and they best survive during warm temperatures. Queens may survive the winter by hibernating.\n\n==Survival advantages==\nMany regions have been reported which were originally home for ''P. fuscatus'' have slowly altered to that of ''P. dominula''. A few possible factors contribute to the prevalence of ''P. dominula'' over ''P. fuscatus'', specifically in settling into a [[territory (animal)|territory.]] Some of the factors include productive colony cycle, short developmental time, aposematic coloration, a generalist diet, and the ability to colonize new environment.<ref name=\"Citation 1\" />\n\n===Colony cycle===\n''P. dominula'' colonies are established by females that have left their natal combs to mate and find new settlements. These \"foundresses\" use three major strategies to establish new colonies, including  building a nest by herself, finding \"associate foundresses\" to build the nest together, and sitting and waiting for the original foundress to leave the nest and then displace her. Once the foundresses have settled, the \"founding phase\" is over and is followed by the \"worker phase\", where the first generation of offspring are produced and grow as workers.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Jandt|first1=J.M.|last2=Tibbettes|first2=S.|last3=Toth|first3=A.L|title=Polistes Paper Wasps: A Model Genus for the Social Dominance Hierarchies|journal=Insectes Sociaux|date=2013|volume=61|pages=11\u201327|doi=10.1007/s00040-013-0328-0}}</ref>\n\n''P. dominula'' appears to have relatively high colony productivity as compared to other ''Polistes'' species.<ref name=\"Citation 1\" /><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Cervo|first1=R.|last2=Zacchi|first2=F.|last3=Turillazzi|first3=S|title=''Polistes dominulus'' (Hymenoptera: Vespidae) invading North America; some hypotheses for its rapid spread|journal=Insectes Sociaux|date=2000|volume=47|issue=2|pages=155\u2013157|doi=10.1007/pl00001694}}</ref> In matched comparisons of filed colonies in Michigan, single foundress colonies of ''P. dominula'' were four to five times as productive as the colony cycle of ''P. fuscatus''.

Compared to that of other ''Polistes'' species, ''P. dominula'' brood developmental period is much shorter. For instance, ''P. dominula'' produces its first workers much earlier than the native ''P. metricus'', a native North American species.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> Similarly, when compared to ''P. fuscatus'', ''P. dominula'' workers were produced about 6 days earlier even when their egg-hatching dates were the same. This indicated that the development times for the [[larvae]] and [[pupae]],  though not the eggs, were significantly shorter in ''P. dominula'' than in ''P. fuscatus''.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\nThe precise reasons for ''P. dominula'' to have such shorter brood development timing is unknown, but a number of conjectures are offered. At the mechanical level, both genetic factors (e.g., smaller adult body size) and environmental influences (e.g., higher provisioning levels) may play a role. In a different aspect, the selection pressure exerted by the European social parasites such as ''[[Polistes sulcifer]]'' and ''[[Polistes semenowi]]'' might have caused the developmental times in ''P. dominula'' to be shorter. Because these [[parasites]] normally attack the host nests just prior to worker emergence, it would be advantageous for ''P. dominula'' to have a shortened brood developmental time.<ref name=\"Citation 3\" />\n\n===Generalist diet===\n''P. dominula'' has a more generalist diet than many other ''Polistes'' species, giving it a more flexible selection of prey.<ref name=\"Cervo 155\u2013157\"/> One study in Europe found that the prey items brought back to nests by ''P. dominula'' colonies represented three insect orders<ref name=Nonacs /> while in contrast, North American ''Polistes'' primarily only use caterpillars to feed their offspring.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Rabb|first1=R.L|title=Biological Studies of ''Polistes'' in North Carolina (Hymenoptera: Vespidae)|journal=Ann.

Am.|date=1960|volume=53|issue=1|pages=111\u2013121|doi=10.1093/aesa/53.1.111}}</ref> Some other theories, however, suggested not that individuals have a more general dietary, but rather the response of colonies may be more opportunistic relative to resources. For example, ''P. dominula'' uses more workers to increase the amount of foraging, use eggs to feed the offspring, and reduce allocation of protein to nest construction to take advantage of poorer quality prey during periods of low prey availability.<ref name=\"Citation 3\" />\n\n===Strong defense against predation===\nAnother strength of ''P. dominula'' in terms of survival rate is their ability to suffer less nest predation than other ''Polistes''. ''P. dominula'' is a less attractive prey for birds mainly due to its [[aposematic]] coloration and the relatively strong attachment of the comb to the substrate \u2013 typically tree branches or man-made structures.<ref name=\"Cervo 155\u2013157\"/> Unlike ''P. fuscatus'', which is colored brown with a few faint, thin, yellow stripes, ''P. dominula'' is colored bright yellow with alternating black, similar to the warning coloration of ''[[Vespula germanica]]'', a common and aggressive [[yellowjacket]].<ref name=\"Cervo 155\u2013157\"/> In addition to their alerting coloration, ''P. dominula'' comb strength also contributes to their higher chance of survival. ''P. dominula'' might have an advantage over ''P. fuscatus'' against [[Bird|avian]] predators because their combs are less likely to be dislodged from the substrate by birds because the side force required to dislodge it is greater for ''P. dominula'' than for ''P. fuscatus'' combs.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Silagi|first1=S.A.|last2=Gamboa|first2=G.J.|last3=Klein|first3=C.R.|last4=Nobel|first4=M.A|title=Behavioral difference between two recently sympatric paper wasps, the native Polistes fuscatus and the invasive Polistes dominulus|journal=Gt.

For instance, if an alpha female is removed from a nest, then another female, usually the second-most dominant, beta female, assumes the role and behavioral profile of the removed dominant. Indeed, individuals alternate between different profiles of behavior within their own dominance rank position. When larvae were artificially removed, the frequency of worker reproduction increased. Therefore, workers lay eggs when they perceive a decline in queen power, as demonstrated by artificially empty cells.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Liebig|first=J.|author2=Monnin, T. |author3=Turillazzi, S. |title=Direct assessment of queen quality and lack of worker suppression in a paper wasp|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|year=2005|volume=272|issue=1570|pages=1339\u20131344|doi=10.1098/rspb.2005.3073|pmid=16006333|pmc=1560329}}</ref>\n\nThe interactions of females in the nest can influence which daughters become workers and which become [[gyne]]s.

They are [[haplodiploid]] insects, as are other ''Polistes'' species. The [[haploid]] males produce identical haploid sperm, and [[diploid]] females produce haploid eggs through [[meiosis]]. In most social insects, colonies are composed of related individuals, and social insects are assumed to help close relatives according to [[W. D. Hamilton]]'s theory of [[kin selection]]. However, in ''P. dominula'', 35% of the nest mates are unrelated.<ref name=\"Citation 1\" /><ref name=Davies /> In many other species, unrelated individuals only help the queen when no other options are present. In this case, subordinates work for unrelated queens even when other options may be present. No other social insect submits to unrelated queens in this way. This seemingly unfavorable behavior parallels some [[vertebrate]] systems. This unrelated assistance may be evidence of [[altruism]] in ''P. dominula''.<ref name=\"Citation 1\" />\n\nThe majority of nests had one or more females that were unrelated, especially in the winter before nests are formed and workers born. The nests tend to form from foundresses of different nests from previous years. The foundresses are also found overwintering with other [[wasp]] species, showing why unrelated wasps are found during winter. However, after winter when the nests are starting to be formed, an increase in relatedness in the nests is seen, which could result from foundresses searching for more related sisters, instead of unrelated wasps. After winter, as wasps leave their winter areas and return to their nests, an increase in relatedness occurs in the early nest phase. In later stages of the nest, more unrelated wasps are found, which could be because new wasps join established nests.<ref name=\"Citation 4\">{{cite journal|last=Zanette|first=Lorenzo|author2=Jeremy Field|title=Genetic relatedness in early associations of Polistes dominulus: from related to unrelated helpers|journal=Molecular Ecology|date=June 2008|volume=17|issue=11|pages=2590\u20132597|doi=10.1111/j.1365-294X.2008.03785.x|pmid=18482265}}</ref>\n\n==Recognition==\n[[File:Polistes dominulus 5.jpg|thumbnail|''P. dominula'']]\n\n===Use of cutical hydrocarbons===\n''P. dominula'' females are able to distinguish between nestmates and non-nestmates.

Chemical analysis of the Dufour's gland secretion revealed that it has a very similar composition as the cuticular hydrocarbons. However, a big difference was that cuticular hydrocarbons had more linear hydrocarbons than the glands and dimethylalkanes were more prevalent in gland secretions. Significantly different dimethylalkanes were found in foundresses belonging to different colonies, suggesting that these could be used to discriminate species of different origins.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Dani|first1=F.R.|last2=E.d.|first2=Morgan|last3=Turillazzi|first3=S.|title=Dufour gland secretion of ''Polistes'' wasp: Chemical composition and possible involvement in nestmage recognition (Hymenoptera: Vespidae)|journal=Journal of Insect Physiology|date=1996|volume=42|issue=6|pages=541\u2013548|doi=10.1016/0022-1910(95)00136-0}}</ref>\n\n===Roles of cuticular hydrocarbons in larvae===\nBecause the chemicals coated on the nests are equivalent to that present in adult ''P. dominula'' bodies, young wasps learn this chemical template in the very early state of the adult life to later on be able to distinguish their nest mates from non-nest mates.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> The CHC composition of the larvae and adults are very different, in that the larvae's relative abundance of low-molecular-weight cuticular hydrocarbons is higher and that the larval profiles are more uniform than those of adults.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Lorenzi|first1=M.C.|last2=Sledge|first2=M.F.|last3=Laiolo|first3=P|last4=Sturlini|first4=E.|last5=Turillazzi|first5=S.|title=Cuticular hydrocarbon dynamics in young adult ''Polistes dominulus'' (Hymenoptera: Vespidae) and the role of linear hydrocarbon in nestmate recognition systems|journal=Journal of Insect Physiology|date=2004|volume=50|issue=10|pages=935\u2013941|pmid=15518661|doi=10.1016/j.jinsphys.2004.07.005}}</ref> Adults are also able to distinguish odors of their own colonial larval cuticular hydrocarbons from those of foreign colonies.\n\n==Behavior==\n\n===Foundress behavior===\n[[File:Polistes dominulus-pjt1.jpg|thumbnail|left|Rasping wood fibers for nest-building]]\nIn the first 12 days of the nesting period, 75% of foundresses leave their original nests, and travel to around three nests before settling permanently, choosing the nest with the highest reproductive payoff.<ref name=Pratte /> Foundresses choose nest sites by weighing the benefit of an expanded colony with the cost of [[predation|predation risk]].<ref name=\"Starks 2003\">{{cite journal|last=Starks|first=Philip T.|title=Natal Nest Discrimination in the Paper Wasp, Polistes Dominula|journal=Annales Zoologici Fennici|year=2003|volume=40|pages=53\u201360}}</ref> Multiple-foundress nests have a higher chance of survival compared to single-foundress nests, and in general, foundresses found nests with those with which they [[hibernate]] in the same aggregation.<ref name=Zanette />\n\n===Comb arrangement===\n[[File:Wasp colony.jpg|thumb|right|300px|''P. dominula'' queen taking care of her nest]]\nThe nest, consisting of a single comb, is the heart of the colony, where  food is stored and the immature brood reared.

However, this area could occasionally cover up to 50% of the comb. Dominant females occupy a smaller area than do subordinate foundresses and workers. Superimposition rates are low, which suggests that wasps limit each other's spaces. Workers prefer to overlap areas with other workers, while foundresses prefer to overlap areas with other foundresses. Around 70% of workers are active and occupy a small area of the comb, while the rest do not have particular fidelity areas and spend most of their time away from the nest or remaining motionless behind the nest.

No difference of foraging behaviors occurs between colonies with and without queens.

Females engaging in the \"sit-and-wait\" reproductive strategy adopted the most mature nest rather than the nest with an increased probability of containing kin (from the same population). Females prioritize the quality of the nest over rescuing possible kin from another abandoned nest. Females demonstrate a preference for mature nests and nests with a large proportion of fourth- and fifth-instar [[larvae]]. When a female adopts an orphaned nest, she destroys the existing eggs and larvae, but allows older larvae and pupae to complete development. Adopting a nest maximizes the potential of possessing a mature preworker phase colony without expending excessive energy during the nest founding period or cooperating in the construction of the nest.<ref name=\"Starks 2001\"/>\n\nOnce a nest is established, it may be used by multiple generations and in multiple seasons. Nests abandoned during the hibernation cycle are almost always repopulated the following spring. With each succession, the nest continues to grow in size. A few have been recorded at 8 inches in diameter. Multiple nests may be located in the same area within inches of each other.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\n===Mating===\n''P. dominula'' wasps have a [[Lek mating|lek-based mating system]]. Males compete intensely for dominant positions on the lek, while females are scrupulous when choosing their mates. Males form aggregations on the uppermost portions of structures such as fences, walls, roof peaks, and trees. Males often fight with other males in mid-air or on the structure. Males that lose will fly away from the lek. Females fly through leks or perch near lekking areas to observe males before making choices on mates. Females use the highly conspicuous abdominal spots on males, which are highly variable in size and shape, to aid in mate choice. Males with smaller, more elliptically shaped spots are more dominant over other males and preferred by females compared to males that have larger, more irregularly shaped spots.<ref name=\"Spotting the top male\"/>\n\nSocial insect males are often seen as mating machines, with an undiscriminating eagerness to mate. However, males encounter costs of unsuccessful mating in terms of energy investment. Therefore, ''P. dominula'' males are able to recognize female [[castes]] and preferentially choose reproductive females to workers, regardless of health or age. Males are able to differentiate castes through perceiving differences in chemical signals and physiological status. While males are able to discriminate between castes, they are not capable of discriminating between health, as males showed a strong preference for gynes, both healthy and parasite-castrated, compared to workers, because males distinguish females by CHC profiles, which are very similar between healthy and unhealthy gynes. Therefore, males are not able to evaluate the true reproductive potential of the females they encounter.<ref name=\"Cappa 2013 801\u2013810\">{{cite journal|last=Cappa|first=F.|author2=Bruschini, C. |author3=Cervo, R. |author4=Turillazzi, S. |author5= Beani, L. |title=Males do not like the working class: male sexual preference and recognition of functional castes in a primitively eusocial wasp|journal=Animal Behaviour|year=2013|volume=86|issue=4|pages=801\u2013810|doi=10.1016/j.anbehav.2013.07.020}}</ref>\n\nIn response to the males being sexually aggressive,  females of ''P'''.''' dominula'' demonstrate ways to weed out the low-quality males.

Another way is to remain still while the male mounts, but move her abdomen to prevent the male's [[genitalia]] entering her body.<ref name=\"Cervo 155\u2013157\"/> Females are also known to mate with multiple males, especially with non-nest mates.<ref name=\"springerlink.com\"/> They fly over to different males' nests to assess the best-quality males and generally copulate with the resident males.

The switch from production of workers to production of future foundresses ([[gyne]]s) is not utterly abrupt, as has been considered the case for other species of ''Polistes''.\n\nThe colony disperses in the late summer, with only males and future foundresses produced instead of workers, and individuals frequently cluster in groups (called a [[Hibernaculum (zoology)|hibernaculum]]) to overwinter. Hibernation does not usually take place on former nest sites.\n\n[[File:Wasp March 2008-1.jpg|thumb|Paper wasp with regurgitated [[nectar]]]]\n\nSocial hierarchies established within the colony can also influence individual ''P. dominula''{{'}}s longevity. Queens live longer than the males or the workers because the workers protect the queens from predators. The queen starts laying eggs in late March or early April, immediately after the \"founding phase\" of the newly built nest. Then, the colony disperses in the late summer, with only males and future foundresses produced instead of workers. Although individuals frequently cluster in groups (to overwinter), neither most nonreproductive males nor nonreproductive females survive the winter because their lifespans are shorter than a year (around 11 months) and they best survive during warm temperatures. Queens may survive the winter by hibernating.\n\n==Survival advantages==\nMany regions have been reported which were originally home for ''P. fuscatus'' have slowly altered to that of ''P. dominula''. A few possible factors contribute to the prevalence of ''P. dominula'' over ''P. fuscatus'', specifically in settling into a [[territory (animal)|territory.]] Some of the factors include productive colony cycle, short developmental time, aposematic coloration, a generalist diet, and the ability to colonize new environment.<ref name=\"Citation 1\" />\n\n===Colony cycle===\n''P. dominula'' colonies are established by females that have left their natal combs to mate and find new settlements. These \"foundresses\" use three major strategies to establish new colonies, including  building a nest by herself, finding \"associate foundresses\" to build the nest together, and sitting and waiting for the original foundress to leave the nest and then displace her. Once the foundresses have settled, the \"founding phase\" is over and is followed by the \"worker phase\", where the first generation of offspring are produced and grow as workers.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Jandt|first1=J.M.|last2=Tibbettes|first2=S.|last3=Toth|first3=A.L|title=Polistes Paper Wasps: A Model Genus for the Social Dominance Hierarchies|journal=Insectes Sociaux|date=2013|volume=61|pages=11\u201327|doi=10.1007/s00040-013-0328-0}}</ref>\n\n''P. dominula'' appears to have relatively high colony productivity as compared to other ''Polistes'' species.<ref name=\"Citation 1\" /><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Cervo|first1=R.|last2=Zacchi|first2=F.|last3=Turillazzi|first3=S|title=''Polistes dominulus'' (Hymenoptera: Vespidae) invading North America; some hypotheses for its rapid spread|journal=Insectes Sociaux|date=2000|volume=47|issue=2|pages=155\u2013157|doi=10.1007/pl00001694}}</ref> In matched comparisons of filed colonies in Michigan, single foundress colonies of ''P. dominula'' were four to five times as productive as the colony cycle of ''P. fuscatus''.

Compared to that of other ''Polistes'' species, ''P. dominula'' brood developmental period is much shorter. For instance, ''P. dominula'' produces its first workers much earlier than the native ''P. metricus'', a native North American species.<ref name=\"ReferenceC\"/> Similarly, when compared to ''P. fuscatus'', ''P. dominula'' workers were produced about 6 days earlier even when their egg-hatching dates were the same. This indicated that the development times for the [[larvae]] and [[pupae]],  though not the eggs, were significantly shorter in ''P. dominula'' than in ''P. fuscatus''.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\" />\n\nThe precise reasons for ''P. dominula'' to have such shorter brood development timing is unknown, but a number of conjectures are offered. At the mechanical level, both genetic factors (e.g., smaller adult body size) and environmental influences (e.g., higher provisioning levels) may play a role. In a different aspect, the selection pressure exerted by the European social parasites such as ''[[Polistes sulcifer]]'' and ''[[Polistes semenowi]]'' might have caused the developmental times in ''P. dominula'' to be shorter. Because these [[parasites]] normally attack the host nests just prior to worker emergence, it would be advantageous for ''P. dominula'' to have a shortened brood developmental time.<ref name=\"Citation 3\" />\n\n===Generalist diet===\n''P. dominula'' has a more generalist diet than many other ''Polistes'' species, giving it a more flexible selection of prey.<ref name=\"Cervo 155\u2013157\"/> One study in Europe found that the prey items brought back to nests by ''P. dominula'' colonies represented three insect orders<ref name=Nonacs /> while in contrast, North American ''Polistes'' primarily only use caterpillars to feed their offspring.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Rabb|first1=R.L|title=Biological Studies of ''Polistes'' in North Carolina (Hymenoptera: Vespidae)|journal=Ann.

Am.|date=1960|volume=53|issue=1|pages=111\u2013121|doi=10.1093/aesa/53.1.111}}</ref> Some other theories, however, suggested not that individuals have a more general dietary, but rather the response of colonies may be more opportunistic relative to resources. For example, ''P. dominula'' uses more workers to increase the amount of foraging, use eggs to feed the offspring, and reduce allocation of protein to nest construction to take advantage of poorer quality prey during periods of low prey availability.<ref name=\"Citation 3\" />\n\n===Strong defense against predation===\nAnother strength of ''P. dominula'' in terms of survival rate is their ability to suffer less nest predation than other ''Polistes''. ''P. dominula'' is a less attractive prey for birds mainly due to its [[aposematic]] coloration and the relatively strong attachment of the comb to the substrate \u2013 typically tree branches or man-made structures.<ref name=\"Cervo 155\u2013157\"/> Unlike ''P. fuscatus'', which is colored brown with a few faint, thin, yellow stripes, ''P. dominula'' is colored bright yellow with alternating black, similar to the warning coloration of ''[[Vespula germanica]]'', a common and aggressive [[yellowjacket]].<ref name=\"Cervo 155\u2013157\"/> In addition to their alerting coloration, ''P. dominula'' comb strength also contributes to their higher chance of survival.

They are [[haplodiploid]] insects, as are other ''Polistes'' species. The [[haploid]] males produce identical haploid sperm, and [[diploid]] females produce haploid eggs through [[meiosis]]. In most social insects, colonies are composed of related individuals, and social insects are assumed to help close relatives according to [[W. D. Hamilton]]'s theory of [[kin selection]]. However, in ''P. dominula'', 35% of the nest mates are unrelated.<ref name=\"Citation 1\" /><ref name=Davies /> In many other species, unrelated individuals only help the queen when no other options are present. In this case, subordinates work for unrelated queens even when other options may be present. No other social insect submits to unrelated queens in this way. This seemingly unfavorable behavior parallels some [[vertebrate]] systems. This unrelated assistance may be evidence of [[altruism]] in ''P. dominula''.<ref name=\"Citation 1\" />\n\nThe majority of nests had one or more females that were unrelated, especially in the winter before nests are formed and workers born. The nests tend to form from foundresses of different nests from previous years. The foundresses are also found overwintering with other [[wasp]] species, showing why unrelated wasps are found during winter. However, after winter when the nests are starting to be formed, an increase in relatedness in the nests is seen, which could result from foundresses searching for more related sisters, instead of unrelated wasps. After winter, as wasps leave their winter areas and return to their nests, an increase in relatedness occurs in the early nest phase. In later stages of the nest, more unrelated wasps are found, which could be because new wasps join established nests.<ref name=\"Citation 4\">{{cite journal|last=Zanette|first=Lorenzo|author2=Jeremy Field|title=Genetic relatedness in early associations of Polistes dominulus: from related to unrelated helpers|journal=Molecular Ecology|date=June 2008|volume=17|issue=11|pages=2590\u20132597|doi=10.1111/j.1365-294X.2008.03785.x|pmid=18482265}}</ref>\n\n==Recognition==\n[[File:Polistes dominulus 5.jpg|thumbnail|''P. dominula'']]\n\n===Use of cutical hydrocarbons===\n''P. dominula'' females are able to distinguish between nestmates and non-nestmates.

However, [[Dufour's gland]] secretion has also been discovered to contribute in such assessments of invaders and nest mates. Chemical analysis of the Dufour's gland secretion revealed that it has a very similar composition as the cuticular hydrocarbons. However, a big difference was that cuticular hydrocarbons had more linear hydrocarbons than the glands and dimethylalkanes were more prevalent in gland secretions. Significantly different dimethylalkanes were found in foundresses belonging to different colonies, suggesting that these could be used to discriminate species of different origins.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Dani|first1=F.R.|last2=E.d.|first2=Morgan|last3=Turillazzi|first3=S.|title=Dufour gland secretion of ''Polistes'' wasp: Chemical composition and possible involvement in nestmage recognition (Hymenoptera: Vespidae)|journal=Journal of Insect Physiology|date=1996|volume=42|issue=6|pages=541\u2013548|doi=10.1016/0022-1910(95)00136-0}}</ref>\n\n===Roles of cuticular hydrocarbons in larvae===\nBecause the chemicals coated on the nests are equivalent to that present in adult ''P. dominula'' bodies, young wasps learn this chemical template in the very early state of the adult life to later on be able to distinguish their nest mates from non-nest mates.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> The CHC composition of the larvae and adults are very different, in that the larvae's relative abundance of low-molecular-weight cuticular hydrocarbons is higher and that the larval profiles are more uniform than those of adults.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Lorenzi|first1=M.C.|last2=Sledge|first2=M.F.|last3=Laiolo|first3=P|last4=Sturlini|first4=E.|last5=Turillazzi|first5=S.|title=Cuticular hydrocarbon dynamics in young adult ''Polistes dominulus'' (Hymenoptera: Vespidae) and the role of linear hydrocarbon in nestmate recognition systems|journal=Journal of Insect Physiology|date=2004|volume=50|issue=10|pages=935\u2013941|pmid=15518661|doi=10.1016/j.jinsphys.2004.07.005}}</ref> Adults are also able to distinguish odors of their own colonial larval cuticular hydrocarbons from those of foreign colonies.\n\n==Behavior==\n\n===Foundress behavior===\n[[File:Polistes dominulus-pjt1.jpg|thumbnail|left|Rasping wood fibers for nest-building]]\nIn the first 12 days of the nesting period, 75% of foundresses leave their original nests, and travel to around three nests before settling permanently, choosing the nest with the highest reproductive payoff.<ref name=Pratte /> Foundresses choose nest sites by weighing the benefit of an expanded colony with the cost of [[predation|predation risk]].<ref name=\"Starks 2003\">{{cite journal|last=Starks|first=Philip T.|title=Natal Nest Discrimination in the Paper Wasp, Polistes Dominula|journal=Annales Zoologici Fennici|year=2003|volume=40|pages=53\u201360}}</ref> Multiple-foundress nests have a higher chance of survival compared to single-foundress nests, and in general, foundresses found nests with those with which they [[hibernate]] in the same aggregation.<ref name=Zanette />\n\n===Comb arrangement===\n[[File:Wasp colony.jpg|thumb|right|300px|''P. dominula'' queen taking care of her nest]]\nThe nest, consisting of a single comb, is the heart of the colony, where  food is stored and the immature brood reared.

However, this area could occasionally cover up to 50% of the comb. Dominant females occupy a smaller area than do subordinate foundresses and workers. Superimposition rates are low, which suggests that wasps limit each other's spaces. Workers prefer to overlap areas with other workers, while foundresses prefer to overlap areas with other foundresses. Around 70% of workers are active and occupy a small area of the comb, while the rest do not have particular fidelity areas and spend most of their time away from the nest or remaining motionless behind the nest.

Females prioritize the quality of the nest over rescuing possible kin from another abandoned nest. Females demonstrate a preference for mature nests and nests with a large proportion of fourth- and fifth-instar [[larvae]]. When a female adopts an orphaned nest, she destroys the existing eggs and larvae, but allows older larvae and pupae to complete development. Adopting a nest maximizes the potential of possessing a mature preworker phase colony without expending excessive energy during the nest founding period or cooperating in the construction of the nest.<ref name=\"Starks 2001\"/>\n\nOnce a nest is established, it may be used by multiple generations and in multiple seasons. Nests abandoned during the hibernation cycle are almost always repopulated the following spring. With each succession, the nest continues to grow in size. A few have been recorded at 8 inches in diameter. Multiple nests may be located in the same area within inches of each other.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}}\n\n===Mating===\n''P. dominula'' wasps have a [[Lek mating|lek-based mating system]]. Males compete intensely for dominant positions on the lek, while females are scrupulous when choosing their mates. Males form aggregations on the uppermost portions of structures such as fences, walls, roof peaks, and trees. Males often fight with other males in mid-air or on the structure. Males that lose will fly away from the lek. Females fly through leks or perch near lekking areas to observe males before making choices on mates. Females use the highly conspicuous abdominal spots on males, which are highly variable in size and shape, to aid in mate choice. Males with smaller, more elliptically shaped spots are more dominant over other males and preferred by females compared to males that have larger, more irregularly shaped spots.<ref name=\"Spotting the top male\"/>\n\nSocial insect males are often seen as mating machines, with an undiscriminating eagerness to mate. However, males encounter costs of unsuccessful mating in terms of energy investment. Therefore, ''P. dominula'' males are able to recognize female [[castes]] and preferentially choose reproductive females to workers, regardless of health or age. Males are able to differentiate castes through perceiving differences in chemical signals and physiological status. While males are able to discriminate between castes, they are not capable of discriminating between health, as males showed a strong preference for gynes, both healthy and parasite-castrated, compared to workers, because males distinguish females by CHC profiles, which are very similar between healthy and unhealthy gynes.

Another way is to remain still while the male mounts, but move her abdomen to prevent the male's [[genitalia]] entering her body.<ref name=\"Cervo 155\u2013157\"/> Females are also known to mate with multiple males, especially with non-nest mates.<ref name=\"springerlink.com\"/> They fly over to different males' nests to assess the best-quality males and generally copulate with the resident males. That males are resident males often implies that they are large, sexually active and aggressive \u2013 providing better protection for her and the brood.<ref name=\"Cappa 2013 801\u2013810\"/>\n\n===Transitive reasoning===\n''P. dominula'' is the first invertebrate to show the ability to perform the mental operation of [[Mental operations#Developmental view|transitive inference]].<ref name=\"BioLetters\"/> This is the ability to deduce that if Tom is taller than Alice and Alice is taller than Pat, Tom must be taller than Pat. This mental ability is common in [[vertebrates]].\n\n''P. dominula'' were trained on five pairs in a series one of which (marked <sub>s</sub>) shocked the insect while the other did not. The series of shocks ran thus: A<sub>s</sub>\u2014B, B<sub>s</sub>\u2014C, C<sub>s</sub>\u2014D, D<sub>s</sub>\u2014E. When tested against a pair they were not trained on, B<sub>s</sub>\u2014D, the ''P. dominula'' wasps chose D more often than chance, indicating that they had used transitive inference to organize the four pairs into a series, and used that to choose when faced with a pair not seen before.<ref name=\"BioLetters\">{{cite journal |last1=Tibbetts |first1=Elizabeth A. |last2=Agudelo |first2=Jorge |last3=Pandit |first3=Sohini |last4=Riojas |first4=Jessica |title=Transitive inference in ''Polistes'' paper wasps |journal=Biology Letters |date=31 May 2019 |volume=15 |issue=5 |pages=20190015 |doi=10.1098/rsbl.2019.0015 |pmid=31064309 |publisher=The Royal Society |location=London |language=English}}</ref>\n\n==Parasitoidism==\n''P. dominula'' nests have resident brood [[parasites]] and [[parasitoids]], including predacious [[Lepidoptera]] [[larvae]], [[Hymenoptera]], [[Diptera]], and [[Strepsiptera]].<ref name=\"Madden\"/> ''P. dominula'' is also parasitized by ''Polistes sulcifer'', a permanent workerless social parasite. ''P. sulcifer'' females take over the host colony by eliminating dominant foundresses and matching their cuticular profiles. ''P. sulcifer'' females gain these cuticular profiles by intensively grooming and licking the host foundresses and workers, or from the nest material which is covered in cuticular hydrocarbons essential for nest mate recognition. This chemical mimicry allows foreign ''P. sulcifer'' females to gain acceptance from the host insects.<ref>{{cite book|last=Stewart|first=Emily M.|title=Social insects : structure, function, and behavior|year=2010|publisher=Nova Science|location=Hauppauge, N.Y.|isbn=978-1-61761-466-8}}</ref> The first well-documented case of parasitoidism of the North American invasive population was reported in 2010.<ref name=\"Madden\"/>\n\n==Industrial use of salivary proteins==\nSalivary proteins harvested from the nest of ''P. dominula'' have been cloned for use as a waterproof coating used in the manufacture of biodegradable [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|drones]]. The lightweight material used to construct the body of the UAV consists of fungal [[mycelium]] covered with bacterial [[cellulose]] sheets. The cellulose is then waterproofed with a coating of the cloned protein, which is a component of the saliva used by the wasps to waterproof their paper nests.<ref>{{cite journal|last=Rutkin|first=Aviva|date=15 September 2014|title=Bio-drone just melts away if it crashes|journal=New Scientist|volume=224|issue=2995|pages=21|url=http://newscientist.com|doi=10.1016/s0262-4079(14)62186-2}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://2014.igem.org/Team:StanfordBrownSpelman/Material_Waterproofing|title=Material waterproofing|last=Anon|publisher=IGEM 2014|accessdate=21 November 2014}}</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==Further reading==\n*{{Cite journal |title=Intra-specific variation in the comb structure of ''Polistes dominulus'': parameters, maturation, nest size and cell arrangement |last=Karsai |first=I. |lastauthoramp=yes |last2=Penzes |first2=Z. |journal=[[Insectes Sociaux]] |volume=43 |issue=3 |pages=277\u2013296 |year=1996 |doi=10.1007/BF01242929}}\n\n==External links==\n{{Commons|Polistes dominula|''Polistes dominula''}}\n{{Wikispecies|Polistes dominula|''Polistes dominula''}}\n*[http://www.cirrusimage.com/Bees_wasp_polistes.htm Paper wasp ''Polistes dominula'' reference photographs, biological notes]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20091027122434/http://geocities.com/quelea/waspinfo.html ''Polistes dominula'' facial markings indicating dominance]\n*[https://web.archive.org/web/20141017164410/https://bioweb.uwlax.edu/bio203/f2013/dewinter_chri/classification.htm \"Phylogenetic Tree of ''Polistes dominula'' \"]\n\n{{Taxonbar|from=Q221487}}\n\n[[Category:Hymenoptera of Europe]]\n[[Category:Hymenoptera of Asia]]\n[[Category:Polistes|dominula]]\n[[Category:Insects described in 1791]]\n[[Category:Taxa named by Johann Ludwig Christ]]\n", "name_user": "Rjwilmsi", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200eTransitive reasoning:Journal cites:, added 1 PMC", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_paper_wasp"}
