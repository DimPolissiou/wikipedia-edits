Aboriginal Australians used fire for a variety of purposes: to encourage the growth of edible plants and fodder for prey; to reduce the risk of catastrophic bushfires; to make travel easier; to eliminate pests; for ceremonial purposes; for warfare and just to \"clean up country.\" There is disagreement, however, about the extent to which this burning led to large-scale changes in vegetation patterns.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://theconversation.com/aboriginal-australians-co-existed-with-the-megafauna-for-at-least-17-000-years-70589|last1=Westaway|first1=Michael|last2=Olley|first2=Jon|last3=Grun|first3=Rainer|title=Aboriginal Australians co-existed with the megafauna for at least 17,000 years|work=The Conversation|date=12 January 2017|accessdate=12 January 2017}}</ref>\n\n===Food===\n[[File:Aboriginal grinding stones.jpg|thumb|220px|left|Aboriginal grinding stones - a pestle and mortar - vital in making flours for [[bush bread]]. Aboriginal women were expert at making bread from a variety of seasonal grains and nuts.]]\nAboriginal Australians were limited to the range of foods occurring naturally in their area, but they knew exactly when, where and how to find everything edible. Anthropologists and nutrition experts who have studied the tribal diet in Arnhem Land found it to be well-balanced, with most of the nutrients modern dietitians recommend. But food was not obtained without effort. In some areas both men and women had to spend from half to two-thirds of each day hunting or foraging for food. Each day, the women of the group went into successive parts of one countryside with wooden digging sticks and plaited dilly bags or wooden coolamons. Larger animals and birds, such as kangaroos and emus, were speared or disabled with a thrown club, [[boomerang]], or stone. Many Indigenous hunting devices were used to get within striking distance of prey. The men were excellent [[Aboriginal tracker|trackers]] and stalkers, approaching their prey running where there was cover, or 'freezing' and crawling when in the open. They were careful to stay downwind and sometimes covered themselves with mud to disguise their smell.\n\nFish were sometimes taken by hand by stirring up the muddy bottom of a pool until they rose to the surface, or by placing the crushed leaves of poisonous plants in the water to stupefy them. Fish spears, nets, wicker or stone traps were also used in different areas. Lines with hooks made from bone, shell, wood or spines were used along the north and east coasts. Dugong, turtle and large fish were harpooned, the harpooner launching himself bodily from the canoe to give added weight to the thrust. Both Torres Strait Island populations and mainland aborigines were agriculturalists who supplemented their diet through the acquisition of wild foods.<ref>Gammage, Bill (October 2011).

Allen & Unwin. pp. 281\u2013304. {{ISBN|978-1-74237-748-3}}.</ref> Aboriginal Australians along the coast and rivers were also expert fishermen. Some Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people relied on the dingo as a companion animal, using it to assist with hunting and for warmth on cold nights.\n[[File:Aboriginal craft made from weaving grass.jpg|thumb|220px|Aboriginal women's implements, including a [[coolamon (vessel)|coolamon]] lined with [[paperbark]] and a digging stick. This woven basket style is from Northern Australia. Baskets were used for collecting fruits, corms, seeds and even water \u2013 some baskets were woven so tightly as to be watertight.]]\nIn present-day [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], for example, there were two separate communities with an economy based on eel-farming in complex and extensive irrigated pond systems; one on the Murray River in the state's north, the other in the south-west near [[Hamilton, Victoria|Hamilton]] in the territory of the [[Djab Wurrung]], which traded with other groups from as far away as the Melbourne area (see [[Gunditjmara]]). A primary tool used in hunting is the [[spear]], launched by a [[Woomera (spear-thrower)|woomera]] or spear-thrower in some locales. Boomerangs were also used by some mainland Indigenous Australians. The non-returnable boomerang (known more correctly as a [[Throwing Stick]]), more powerful than the returning kind, could be used to injure or even kill a kangaroo.\n\nOn mainland Australia no animal other than the dingo and the [[Short-finned eel]] were [[domestication|domesticated]], however domestic pigs and [[cassowaries]] were utilised by Torres Strait Islanders.<ref>Davies, S. J. J. F. (2002). Ratites and Tinamous. Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-854996-2}}</ref> The typical Aboriginal diet included a wide variety of foods, such as pig, [[kangaroo]], [[emu]], [[wombat]]s, [[goanna]], snakes, birds, many insects such as [[honeypot ant|honey ants]], [[Bogong moth]]s and [[witchetty grub]]s. Many varieties of plant foods such as [[taro]], [[coconut]]s, nuts, fruits and berries were also eaten.\n\n===Culture===\n[[File:Lomandra textiles.jpg|thumb|220px|left|''Lomandra'', a plant used by Aboriginal Australians for weaving]]\nPermanent villages were the norm for most Torres Strait Island communities. In some areas mainland Aboriginal Australians also lived in semi-permanent villages, most usually in less arid areas where fishing could provide for a more settled existence. Most Indigenous communities were [[semi-nomadic]], moving in a regular cycle over a defined territory, following [[seasonal food]] sources and returning to the same places at the same time each year. From the examination of [[midden]]s, archaeologists have shown that some localities were visited annually by Indigenous communities for thousands of years. In the more arid areas Aboriginal Australians were nomadic, ranging over wide areas in search of scarce food resources. There is evidence of substantial change in indigenous culture over time. [[Rock painting]] at several locations in northern Australia has been shown to consist of a sequence of different styles linked to different historical periods. There is also prominent [[Sydney rock engravings|rock paintings found in the Sydney basin]] area which date to around 5,000 years.\n\n[[Harry Lourandos]] has been the leading proponent of the theory that a period of hunter-gatherer intensification occurred between 3000 and 1000 BCE. Intensification involved an increase in human manipulation of the environment (for example, the construction of eel traps in Victoria), population growth, an increase in trade between groups, a more elaborate social structure, and other cultural changes. A shift in [[stone tool]] technology, involving the development of smaller and more intricate points and scrapers, occurred around this time. This was probably also associated with the introduction to the mainland of the Australian dingo.\n\nMany Indigenous communities also have a very complex [[Australian Aboriginal kinship|kinship]] structure and in some places strict rules about marriage. In traditional societies, men are required to marry women of a specific [[Moiety (kinship)|moiety]]. The system is still alive in many Central Australian communities. To enable men and women to find suitable partners, many groups would come together for annual gatherings (commonly known as [[corroboree]]s) at which goods were traded, news exchanged, and marriages arranged amid appropriate ceremonies. This practice both reinforced clan relationships and prevented [[inbreeding]] in a society based on small semi-nomadic groups.\n\n==Impact of British colonisation==\n{{See also|European exploration of Australia|History of Australia (1788\u20131850)|Australian frontier wars}}\n\n===1788\u20131900, European settlement===\n[[File:Native Encampment by Skinner Prout, from Australia (1876, vol II).jpg|thumb|upright=1.75|right|A 19th-century engraving of an Aboriginal Australian encampment, showing the indigenous lifestyle in the cooler parts of Australia at the time of European settlement.]]\nIn 1770, Lieutenant [[James Cook]] wrote that he had claimed the east coast of Australia for the [[United Kingdom]] and named it New South Wales, while on [[Possession Island (Queensland)|Possession Island]] off the west coast of [[Cape York Peninsula]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Beaglehole |first1=J.C. |title=The Journals of Captain James Cook, Vol.1 |date=1955 |publisher=Hakluyt Society |location=Cambridge |isbn=978-0851157443 |page=387}}</ref> However, it seems that no such claim was made when Cook was in Australia.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cameron-Ash |first1=M. |title=Lying for the Admiralty |date=2018 |publisher=Rosenberg |isbn=9780648043966 |pages=180\u2013184}}</ref> Cook was not authorized to make such a claim and Joseph Banks, who was standing beside Cook, does not mention the event.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Banks |first1=Joseph |title=The Endeavour Journal of Joseph Banks, vol.2 |date=1962 |publisher=Angus & Robertson |location=Sydney |page=110}}</ref> Furthermore, Cook's purported declaration was made unilaterally and without any consultation with First Australians, in spite of his direct written orders from The Admiralty, which instructed him to conclude a treaty with the inhabitants (if any) and obtain their permission for the expropriation of land. British colonisation of Australia began in Sydney in 1788.\n\nThe first apparent consequence of British settlement appeared in April 1789 when a disease, which was probably [[smallpox]], struck the Aborigines about [[Port Jackson]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Frost |first1=Alan |title=Botany Bay Mirages |date=1994 |publisher=Melbourne University Press |isbn=9780522844979 |pages=190\u2013210}}</ref> Thereafter, other European epidemic diseases arrived such as [[chickenpox]], [[influenza]] and [[measles]], which spread in advance of the frontier of settlement. The worst-hit communities were the ones with the greatest population densities, where disease could spread more readily. In the arid centre of the continent, where small communities were spread over a vast area, the population decline was less marked. Disease was the principal cause of population decline.\n\nThe second consequence of British settlement was appropriation of land and water resources. The settlers took the view that Aboriginal Australians were nomads with no concept of land ownership, who could be driven off land wanted for farming or grazing and who would be just as happy somewhere else. In fact the loss of traditional lands, food sources and water resources was often fatal, particularly to communities already weakened by disease. Additionally, Aboriginal Australians groups had a deep spiritual and cultural connection to the land, so that in being forced to move away from traditional areas, cultural and spiritual practices necessary to the cohesion and well-being of the group could not be maintained. Proximity to settlers also brought [[venereal disease]], to which Aboriginal Australians had no tolerance and which greatly reduced Aboriginal fertility and birthrates. Settlers also brought alcohol, opium and tobacco, and [[substance abuse]] has remained a chronic problem for Aboriginal communities ever since.  Entire communities in the moderately fertile southern part of the continent simply vanished without trace, often before European settlers recorded their existence. \n\n====Diseases====\nDeadly [[Infectious disease#Historic pandemics|infectious diseases]] like smallpox, influenza and [[tuberculosis]] were always major causes of Aboriginal deaths.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.mup.unimelb.edu.au/catalogue/0-522-84939-3.html |title=Invisible Invaders |access-date=7 January 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070904065707/http://www.mup.unimelb.edu.au/catalogue/0-522-84939-3.html |archive-date=4 September 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> \nSmallpox alone killed more than 50% of the Aboriginal population.<ref name=\"Smallpox Through History\"/>\n\nIn April 1789, a major outbreak of smallpox killed large numbers of Indigenous Australians between [[Hawkesbury River]], [[Broken Bay]], and [[Port Hacking]]. Based on information recorded in the journals of some members of the [[First Fleet]], it has been surmised that the Aborigines of the Sydney region had never encountered the disease before and lacked immunity to it. Unable to understand or counter the sickness, they often fled, leaving the sick with some food and water to fend for themselves. As the clans fled, the epidemic spread further along the coast and into the hinterland. This had a disastrous effect on Aboriginal society; with many of the productive [[hunters and gatherers]] dead, those who survived the initial outbreak began to starve.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nLieutenant [[William Bradley (New South Wales colonial politician)|William Bradley]] recorded the first indications of the severity of the disaster that had struck the Aboriginal population of Sydney when he described his shock at the small number of them to be seen on the harbour and its shores compared with previous times. The British had not seen smallpox in anyone among themselves before the outbreak. Although there were fears about the health of some of the convicts on the First Fleet, these were subsequently dismissed by Surgeon-General John White, who believed they were suffering from \"slight inflammatory complaints\".<ref>John White, ''Journal of a Voyage to New South Wales with Sixty-five Plates of Non Descript Animals, Birds, Lizards, Serpents, Curious Cones of Trees and Other Natural Productions'', London, 1795, p. 4.</ref>\n\nSome commentators, such as Judy Campbell,<ref>{{cite book |title=Judy Campbell, Invisible Invaders|publisher=Melbourne University Press|date=1998|isbn=9780522849394}}</ref> have suggested that [[Makassan contact with Australia|Makasar]] fishermen accidentally brought smallpox to Australia's north and the virus travelled south. However, given that the spread of the disease depends on high population densities, and the fact that those who succumbed were soon incapable of walking, such an outbreak was unlikely to have spread across the desert trade routes. A more likely source of the disease was the \"variolas matter\" Surgeon John White brought with him on the [[First Fleet]], although it is unknown how this may have been spread.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nma.gov.au/defining-moments/resources/smallpox-epidemic|website=National Museum Australia|title=Smallpox epidemic|series=Defining moments|accessdate=1 March 2019}} (Includes further citations)</ref> It has been speculated that the vials were either accidentally or intentionally released it as a \"[[biological weapon]]\".<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-180278188.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110831054140/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-180278188.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2011-08-31 |title=The origin of the smallpox outbreak in Sydney in 1789 |journal=Journal of the Royal Australian Historical Society |author=Mear, Craig |accessdate=11 May 2013|date=June 2008 }}</ref> Some researchers, such as Seth Carus<ref>Distinguished Research Fellow, Center for the Study of WMD, National Defense University, Ft.

Many Aboriginal communities resisted the settlers, such as the [[Noongar]] of south-western Australia, led by [[Yagan]], who was killed in 1833. The [[Kalkadoon]] of Queensland also resisted the settlers, and there was a massacre of over 200 people on their land at Battle Mountain in 1884. There was a massacre at [[Coniston (Northern Territory)|Coniston]] in the [[Central Australia (territory)|Territory of Central Australia]] in 1928. Poisoning of food and water has been recorded on several different occasions. The number of violent deaths at the hands of white people is still the subject of debate, with a figure of around 10,000 - 20,000 deaths being advanced by historians such as [[Henry Reynolds (historian)|Henry Reynolds]]. However the methodology behind figures such as this one has been criticised due to the fact that only white deaths were documented in frontier conflicts, forcing historians to estimate a country-wide white-black death ratio in violent confrontations and infer from this the number of Aboriginal deaths.<ref>Windshuttle, The Fabrication of the Aboriginal Death Toll', in Quadrant, November 2000, p. 21.</ref> Reynolds, and other historians, estimate that up to 3,000 [[white people]] were killed by Aboriginal Australians in the frontier violence.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.kooriweb.org/foley/news/story28.html |title=The Statistics of Frontier Conflict |access-date=26 August 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171009084602/http://www.kooriweb.org/foley/news/story28.html |archive-date=9 October 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref> By the 1870s all the fertile areas of Australia had been appropriated, and Aboriginal communities reduced to impoverished remnants living either on the fringes of European communities or on lands considered unsuitable for settlement.\n\nThe [[Aboriginal Tasmanian|Palawa]], or Indigenous people of Tasmania, were particularly hard-hit. Nearly all of them, apparently numbering somewhere between 2,000 and 15,000 when white settlement began, were dead by the 1870s. It is widely claimed that this was the result of a [[genocide|genocidal policy]], in the form of the \"[[Black War]]\". Other historians dispute this. [[Geoffrey Blainey]] wrote that, in Tasmania, by 1830: \"Disease had killed most of them but warfare and private violence had also been devastating.\"<ref>Blainey, Geoffrey : A Land Half Won, Macmillan, South Melbourne, Vic., 1980, p 75</ref> [[Josephine Flood]] wrote: \"The catastrophic death rate was due to new diseases, particularly pulmonary and sexually transmitted ones.\"<ref>Flood, Josephine: The Original Australians: Story of the Aboriginal People, Allen & Unwin, 2006 {{ISBN|978-1741148725}}, p89</ref> Historian [[Keith Windschuttle]] also disagrees that violence was the principal cause. He argues that there are plausible recorded accounts of approximately 120 Aboriginal Tasmanians killed in 1803\u201347, that there were an unknown number of unrecorded killings and that many of these were killed in 'self-defence' by settlers. Windschuttle argues some accounts of killings are implausible for a variety of reasons such as incidents involving improbably large death tolls given the muzzle-loading, single-shot muskets in use and that the low number of plausible recorded killings is one indicator of a relatively low level of conflict.<ref>Windschuttle, Keith (2002).

This belief stems from a distinction between \"full bloods\" and \"[[half-caste|half castes]]\" that is now generally regarded as racist. Palawa people survived, in [[Mission (Christian)|mission]]s set up on the islands of Bass Strait.\n[[File:JM Crossland - Portrait of Nannultera, a young Poonindie cricketer.jpg|thumb|right|This portrait of a young Indigenous boy was commissioned by a member of a Christian mission station to show the achievements of the mission at \"civilising\" the Indigenous population.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://artsearch.nga.gov.au/Detail.cfm?IRN=62236 |title=Portrait of Nannultera, a young Poonindie cricketer |last=Radford |first=Ron |work=Collection highlights: National Gallery of Australia |publisher=National Gallery of Australia |year=2010 |accessdate=11 June 2015}}</ref>]]\n\nNevertheless, some initial contact between Aboriginal people and Europeans was peaceful, starting with the [[Guugu Yimithirr people|Guugu Yimithirr]] people who met James Cook near [[Cooktown, Queensland|Cooktown]] in 1770. [[Bennelong]] served as [[interlocutor (politics)|interlocutor]] between the Eora people of Sydney and the British colony, and was the first Aboriginal Australian to travel to England, staying there between 1792 and 1795. Aboriginal people were known to help European explorers, such as [[John King (explorer)|John King]], who lived with a tribe for two and a half months after the ill-fated [[Burke and Wills expedition]] of 1861. Also living with Indigenous people was [[William Buckley (convict)|William Buckley]], an escaped convict, who was with the [[Wautharong]] people near Melbourne for thirty-two years, before being found in 1835. Many Indigenous people adapted to European culture, working as stock hands or labourers. The first Australian [[cricket]] team, which toured England in 1868, was principally made up of Indigenous players.\n\n====Agriculture====\nAs the European [[transhumance|pastoral]] industries developed, several economic changes came about. The appropriation of prime land and the spread of European livestock over vast areas made a traditional Indigenous lifestyle less viable, but also provided a ready alternative supply of fresh meat for those prepared to incur the settlers' anger by hunting livestock. The impact of disease and the settlers' industries had a profound impact on the Indigenous Australians' way of life. With the exception of a few in the remote interior, all surviving Indigenous communities gradually became dependent on the settler population for their livelihood.\n\nIn south-eastern Australia, during the 1850s, large numbers of white pastoral workers deserted employment on stations for the [[Australian goldrushes]]. Indigenous women, men and children became a significant source of labour. Most Indigenous labour was unpaid, instead Indigenous workers received rations in the form of food, clothing and other basic necessities. In the later 19th century, settlers made their way north and into the interior, appropriating small but vital parts of the land for their own exclusive use (waterholes and soaks in particular), and introducing sheep, [[rabbits in Australia|rabbits]] and [[cattle]], all three of which ate out previously fertile areas and degraded the ability of the land to carry the native animals that were vital to Indigenous economies. Indigenous hunters would often spear sheep and cattle, incurring the wrath of graziers, after they replaced the native animals as a food source. As large sheep and cattle stations came to dominate northern Australia, Indigenous workers were quickly recruited. Several other outback industries, notably [[pearl]]ing, also employed Aboriginal workers.\n\nIn many areas Christian missions provided food and clothing for Indigenous communities and also opened schools and orphanages for Indigenous children. In some places colonial governments provided some resources.\n\n===1900\u20131940s===\n[[File:SLNSW 75764 Warriors in Ambush series 49 Aboriginal Mystic Bora Ceremony.jpg|thumb|upright=1.75|Aboriginal Bora ceremony (early 20th century)]]\nIn spite of the impact of disease, violence and the spread of foreign settlement and custom, some Indigenous communities in remote desert and tropical rainforest areas survived according to traditional means until well into the 20th century.

But by about 1930, those Indigenous Australians who had survived had acquired better resistance to imported diseases, and birthrates began to rise again as communities were able to adapt to changed circumstances. From the 1940s, the availability of [[penicillin]] to treat imported diseases also had a marked effect on reversing the population decline.\n\nIn the Northern Territory, significant frontier conflict continued. Both isolated Europeans and visiting Asian fishermen were killed by hunter gatherers until the start of [[World War II]] in 1939. It is known that some European settlers in the centre and north of the country shot Indigenous people during this period. One particular series of killings became known as the [[Caledon Bay crisis]], and became a watershed in the relationship between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians.\n\nIn the early 20th century, anthropologists' influence dominated society's view of aboriginals in Australia. They were viewed as a different race that was not as evolved as Europeans. Starting in the 1880 and continuing into the 20th century, debate continued on where between ape and man could the aboriginal be situated in evolutionary terms. In the mid-1920s, there was a shift in focus away from physical anthropological issues of race and towards a cultural anthropological concerns established by field-work. New studies described aboriginals' social organisation, religious belief and practice. [[Alfred Radcliffe-Brown]], the father of modern social anthropology, published his ''Social Organization of Australian Tribes'' in 1931.<ref>{{cite book|author=Gillian Cowlishaw|chapter=Australian Aboriginal studies: The anthropologists' accounts|title=The Cultural Construction of Race|editor=M. de Lepervanche|editor2=G.

However, Aboriginal workers remained [[unfree labour]]ers, paid only small amounts of cash in addition to rations, and had their movements severely restricted by regulations and/or police action. On 4 February 1939, [[Jack Patten]] led a strike at [[Cummeragunja Station]] in New South Wales. The people of Cummeragunja were protesting their harsh treatment under what was a draconian system. A once successful farming enterprise was taken from their control, and residents were forced to subsist on meagre rations. Approximately 200 people left their homes, taking part in the [[Cummeragunja walk-off]], and the majority crossed the border into Victoria, never to return home.<ref>http://www.koorihistory.com/jack-patten/ Koori History: Remembering Jack Patten</ref>\n\nOn 1 May 1946, Aboriginal peoples station workers in the beautiful region of Western Australia started the [[1946 Pilbara strike]] and never returned to work. Mass layoffs across northern Australia followed the Federal [[Pastoral Industry Award]] of 1968, which required the payment of a [[minimum wage]] to Aboriginal station workers, as they were not paid by the Pastoralist discretion, many however were not and those who were had their money held by the government. Many of the workers and their families became [[refugees]] or [[fringe dwellers]], living in camps on the outskirts of towns and cities.\n\n==1940s\u2013present==\n{{See also|Stolen Generations|Republicanism in Australia}}\n\nIn 1949, the right to vote in federal elections was extended to Indigenous Australians who had served in the armed forces, or were enrolled to vote in state elections. At that time, those Indigenous Australians who lived in Queensland, Western Australia and the Northern Territory were still ineligible to vote in state elections, consequently they did not have the right to vote in federal elections.\n\nAll Indigenous Australians were given the right to vote in Commonwealth elections in Australia by the [[Robert Menzies|Menzies]] government in 1962.<ref>[http://www.aec.gov.au/Voting/indigenous_vote/indigenous.htm Australian Electoral Commission - Electoral Milestone / Timetable for Indigenous Australians]</ref> The first federal election in which all Aboriginal Australians could vote was held in [[1963 Australian federal election|November 1963]]. The right to vote in state elections was granted in Western Australia in 1962 and Queensland was the last state to do so in 1965.\n\nThe [[Australian referendum, 1967 (Aboriginals)|1967 referendum]], passed with a 90% majority, allowed Indigenous Australians to be included in the Commonwealth parliament's power to make special laws for specific races, and to be included in counts to determine electoral representation. This has been the largest affirmative vote in the history of Australia's referendums.\n\nIn 1971, [[Yolngu]] people at [[Yirrkala, Northern Territory|Yirrkala]] sought an injunction against [[Nabalco]] to cease mining on their traditional land. In the resulting historic and controversial [[Gove land rights case]], Justice Blackburn ruled that Australia had been [[terra nullius]] before European settlement, and that no concept of Native title existed in Australian law. Although the [[Yolngu]] people were defeated in this action, the effect was to highlight the absurdity of the law, which led first to the [[Aboriginal Land Rights Commission|Woodward Commission]], and then to the [[Aboriginal Land Rights Act]].\n\nIn 1972, the [[Aboriginal Tent Embassy]] was established on the steps of [[Politics of Australia|Parliament House]] in [[Canberra]], in response to the sentiment among Indigenous Australians that they were \"strangers in their own country\". A Tent Embassy still exists on the same site.\n\nIn 1975, the [[Whitlam]] government drafted the Aboriginal Land Rights Act, which aimed to restore traditional lands to Indigenous people. After the [[Australian constitutional crisis of 1975|dismissal of the Whitlam government]] by the Governor-General, a reduced-scope version of the Act (known as the [[Aboriginal Land Rights Act 1976]]) was introduced by the coalition government led by [[Malcolm Fraser]]. While its application was limited to the Northern Territory, it did grant \"inalienable\" freehold title to some traditional lands.\n\nIn 1984, [[Pintupi Nine|a group of Pintupi]] people who were living a traditional hunter-gatherer desert-dwelling life were tracked down in the [[Gibson Desert]] in Western Australia and brought into a settlement. They are believed to have been the last [[uncontacted peoples|uncontacted tribe]] in Australia.<ref>[http://recollections.nma.gov.au/issues/vol_1_no_2/exhibition_reviews/colliding_worlds/ Colliding worlds: first contact in the western desert, 1932\u20131984]</ref>\n\nA 1987 federal government report described the history of the \"Aboriginal Homelands Movement\" or \"Return to Country movement\" as \"a concerted attempt by Aboriginal people in the 'remote' areas of Australia to leave government settlements, [[Aboriginal reserve|reserves]], missions and non-Aboriginal townships and to re-occupy their traditional country.\"<ref name=RepsCountry>{{cite web|title=Return to Country: The Aboriginal Homelands Movement in Australia|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/house/committee/reports/1987/1987_PP125A.pdf|publisher=Australian Government Publishing Service}}</ref>\n\nIn 1992, the Australian High Court handed down its decision in the [[Mabo v Queensland (No 2) (1992)|Mabo Case]], declaring the previous legal concept of ''[[terra nullius]]'' to be invalid. This decision legally recognised certain land claims of Indigenous Australians in Australia prior to British Settlement. Legislation was subsequently enacted and later amended to recognise [[Native Title]] claims over land in Australia.\n\nIn 1998, as the result of an inquiry into the forced removal of Indigenous children (see [[Stolen generation]]) from their families, a [[National Sorry Day]] was instituted, to acknowledge the wrong that had been done to Indigenous families. Many politicians, from both sides of the house, participated, with the notable exception of the Prime Minister, [[John Howard]].\n\nIn 1999 a [[Australian referendum, 1999 (Preamble)|referendum]] was held to change the [[Constitution of Australia|Australian Constitution]] to include a preamble that, amongst other topics, recognised the occupation of Australia by Indigenous Australians prior to British Settlement. This referendum was defeated, though the recognition of Indigenous Australians in the preamble was not a major issue in the referendum discussion, and the preamble question attracted minor attention compared to the question of becoming a republic.\n\nIn 2004, the Australian Government abolished The [[Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission]] (ATSIC), which had been Australia's top Indigenous organisation. The Commonwealth cited corruption and, in particular, made allegations concerning the misuse of public funds by ATSIC's chairman, [[Geoff Clark (politician)|Geoff Clark]], as the principal reason. Indigenous specific programmes have been [[mainstream]]ed, that is, reintegrated and transferred to departments and agencies serving the general population. The [[Office of Indigenous Policy Coordination]] was established within the then [[Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Australia)|Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs]], and now with the [[Department of Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs (Australia)|Department of Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs]] to coordinate a \"whole of government\" effort.\n\nIn June 2005, [[Richard Frankland]], founder of the '[[Your Voice]]' political party, in an open letter to Prime Minister John Howard, advocated that the eighteenth-century conflicts between Aboriginal and colonial Australians \"be recognised as wars and be given the same attention as the other wars receive within the [[Australian War Memorial]]\". In its editorial on 20 June 2005, Melbourne newspaper, [[The Age]], said that \"Frankland has raised an important question,\" and asked whether moving \"work commemorating Aborigines who lost their lives defending their land ... to the War Memorial [would] change the way we regard Aboriginal history.\"\n\nIn 2008, Prime Minister [[Kevin Rudd]] made a formal [[Stolen generations#Australian federal parliament apology|apology for the Stolen Generations]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[Aboriginal Australians]]\n* [[Aboriginal history of Western Australia]]\n* [[Aboriginal reserve]]\n* [[Australian archaeology]]\n* ''[[Aboriginal History]]'' (journal)\n*[[Aboriginal land rights in Australia]]\n* [[Aboriginal Tasmanians]]\n*[[Aboriginal title in Australia]]\n*''[[Bringing them home]]'' report (1997)\n* [[Dark Emu (book)|''Dark Emu'']], book by [[Bruce Pascoe]]\n*[[History of Indigenous Australian self-determination]]\n* [[History wars]]\n*[[Indigenous Australians]]\n* [[List of Aboriginal missions in New South Wales]]\n* [[List of Indigenous Australian firsts]]\n* [[List of massacres of Indigenous Australians]]\n* [[Stolen Generations]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Australian Institute of Aboriginal, and Torres Strait Islander Studies.

Some [[anthropologist]]s believe they could have arrived as a result of the [[Recent African origin of modern humans|earliest human migrations out of Africa]]. Although they likely migrated to the territory later named Australia through [[Southeast Asia]], [[Aboriginal Australians]] are not demonstrably related to any known Asian or [[Melanesian]] population, although [[Torres Strait Islander]] people do have a genetic link to some Melanesian populations. There is evidence of [[genetics|genetic]] and [[linguistic]] interchange between Australians in the far north and the [[Austronesian people]]s of modern-day [[New Guinea]] and the islands, but this may be the result of recent trade and [[Interracial marriage|intermarriage]].<ref>{{cite book|author-link=Jared Diamond|first=Jared |last =Diamond|date=1997|title=Guns, Germs, and Steel|publisher =Random House|place= London|pp=314\u2013316}}</ref>\n\nAt the time of first European contact, many estimates have suggested between 315,000 and 750,000 people lived in Australia, in [[List of Aboriginal Australian group names|diverse groups]], but upper estimates place the total population as high as 1.25 million.<ref>{{cite book |title= A History of Queensland |last= Evans |first= R. |year= 2007 |publisher= Cambridge U.

The population shrank from those present when colonisation began in [[New South Wales]] in 1788, to 50,000 in 1930. This drastic reduction in numbers has been attributed to outbreaks of [[smallpox]] and other diseases to which the Indigenous peoples had no immunity,<ref>D.

The greatest [[population density]] was to be found in the southern and eastern regions of the continent, the [[Murray River]] valley in particular. Although the [[Aboriginal Tasmanians]] were almost driven to extinction (and once thought to be so), other Aboriginal Australian peoples maintained successful communities throughout Australia.\n\n==Migration to Australia==\n{{also |Prehistory of Australia}} \nIt is believed that the first [[early human migration]] to Australia was achieved when this landmass formed part of the [[Sahul continent]], connected to the island of New Guinea via a [[land bridge]]. It is also possible that people came by island hopping via an island chain between [[Sulawesi]] and New Guinea and the other reaches North Western Australia via [[Timor]].<ref>Lourandos, Harry. ''Continent of Hunter-Gatherers: New Perspectives in Australian Prehistory'' (Cambridge University Press, 1997) p.81</ref> The exact timing of the arrival of the ancestors of the Aboriginal Australians has been a matter of dispute among archaeologists.

Stone tools also found at Lake Mungo have been estimated, based on [[stratigraphy|stratigraphic association]], to be about 50,000 years old. Since Lake Mungo is in south-eastern Australia, many [[archaeologist]]s have concluded that humans must have arrived in north-west Australia at least several thousand years earlier.\n\nIn 2012, the results of large-scale [[Human genome|genotyping]] has indicated that Aboriginal Australians, the [[Papuan people|indigenous peoples of New Guinea]] and the [[Lumad peoples#Mamanwa|Mamanwa]], an indigenous people of the southern [[Philippines]] are closely related, having diverged from a common origin approximately 36,000 years ago. The same studies show that Aboriginal genomes consist of up to 11% Indian DNA which is uniformly spread through Northern Australia, indicating a substantial gene flow between [[Indian people|Indian populations]] and Northern Australia occurred around 4,230 years ago. Changes in tool technology and food processing appear in the archaeological record around this time, suggesting there may have been migration from [[India]].<ref name=\"india\">{{Cite journal |author1=Irina Pugach |author2=Frederick Delfin |author3=Ellen Gunnarsd\u00f3ttir |author4=Manfred Kayser |author5=Mark Stoneking |title=Genome-wide data substantiate Holocene gene flow from India to Australia |date=14 January 2013 |journal=PNAS |volume=110 |issue=5 |pages=1803\u20131808 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1211927110 |pmid=23319617 |pmc=3562786|bibcode=2013PNAS..110.1803P }}</ref><ref>[http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/journal/aboriginal-genetic-study-suggests-indian-migration.htm Aboriginal genes suggest Indian migration] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130820123208/http://www.australiangeographic.com.au/journal/aboriginal-genetic-study-suggests-indian-migration.htm |date=20 August 2013 }} [[Australian Geographic]] 15 January 2013</ref>\n\n==Early history==\n===Geography===\n[[File:Bassian plain 14000 BP.jpg|thumb|300px|right|The shoreline of Tasmania and Victoria about 14,000 years ago, as sea levels were rising, showing some of the human archaeological sites]]\nWhen the north-west of Australia, which is closest to Asia, was first occupied, the region consisted of [[Tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests|open tropical forests]] and [[woodland]]s.

There is much ongoing debate about the degree to which they modified the environment. One controversy revolves around the role of indigenous people in the extinction of the [[marsupial]] [[megafauna]] (also see [[Australian megafauna]]). Some argue that natural climate change killed the megafauna. Others claim that, because the megafauna were large and slow, they were easy prey for human hunters. A third possibility is that human modification of the environment, particularly through the use of fire, indirectly led to their extinction.{{cn|date=January 2020}} \n\nOral history demonstrates \"the continuity of culture of Indigenous Australians\" for at least 10,000 years.

This contact was not just one-way, as the presence of kangaroo ticks on these dogs demonstrates. Dingoes began and evolved in Asia. The earliest known dingo-like fossils are from Ban Chiang in north-east Thailand (dated at 5500 years BP) and from north Vietnam (5000 years BP). According to skull morphology, these fossils occupy a place between Asian wolves (prime candidates were the pale footed (or Indian) wolf ''Canis lupus pallipes'' and the Arabian wolf ''Canis lupus arabs'') and modern dingoes in Australia and Thailand.<ref>Corbett, Laurie (1995), \"The Dingo: in Australia and Asia\"</ref>\n\nMost scientists presently believe that it was the arrival of the Australian Aboriginal people on the continent and their introduction of [[fire-stick farming]] that was responsible for these extinctions.<ref>Flannery, Tim \"The Future Eaters: An Ecological History of the Australian Lands and People\" (Grove Press)({{ISBN|0-8021-3943-4}})</ref> Fossil research published in 2017 indicates that Aboriginal people and megafauna coexisted for \"at least 17,000 years\".

Aboriginal women were expert at making bread from a variety of seasonal grains and nuts.]]\nAboriginal Australians were limited to the range of foods occurring naturally in their area, but they knew exactly when, where and how to find everything edible. Anthropologists and nutrition experts who have studied the tribal diet in Arnhem Land found it to be well-balanced, with most of the nutrients modern dietitians recommend. But food was not obtained without effort. In some areas both men and women had to spend from half to two-thirds of each day hunting or foraging for food. Each day, the women of the group went into successive parts of one countryside with wooden digging sticks and plaited dilly bags or wooden coolamons. Larger animals and birds, such as kangaroos and emus, were speared or disabled with a thrown club, [[boomerang]], or stone. Many Indigenous hunting devices were used to get within striking distance of prey. The men were excellent [[Aboriginal tracker|trackers]] and stalkers, approaching their prey running where there was cover, or 'freezing' and crawling when in the open. They were careful to stay downwind and sometimes covered themselves with mud to disguise their smell.\n\nFish were sometimes taken by hand by stirring up the muddy bottom of a pool until they rose to the surface, or by placing the crushed leaves of poisonous plants in the water to stupefy them. Fish spears, nets, wicker or stone traps were also used in different areas. Lines with hooks made from bone, shell, wood or spines were used along the north and east coasts. Dugong, turtle and large fish were harpooned, the harpooner launching himself bodily from the canoe to give added weight to the thrust. Both Torres Strait Island populations and mainland aborigines were agriculturalists who supplemented their diet through the acquisition of wild foods.<ref>Gammage, Bill (October 2011).

Allen & Unwin. pp. 281\u2013304. {{ISBN|978-1-74237-748-3}}.</ref> Aboriginal Australians along the coast and rivers were also expert fishermen. Some Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people relied on the dingo as a companion animal, using it to assist with hunting and for warmth on cold nights.\n[[File:Aboriginal craft made from weaving grass.jpg|thumb|220px|Aboriginal women's implements, including a [[coolamon (vessel)|coolamon]] lined with [[paperbark]] and a digging stick. This woven basket style is from Northern Australia. Baskets were used for collecting fruits, corms, seeds and even water \u2013 some baskets were woven so tightly as to be watertight.]]\nIn present-day [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], for example, there were two separate communities with an economy based on eel-farming in complex and extensive irrigated pond systems; one on the Murray River in the state's north, the other in the south-west near [[Hamilton, Victoria|Hamilton]] in the territory of the [[Djab Wurrung]], which traded with other groups from as far away as the Melbourne area (see [[Gunditjmara]]). A primary tool used in hunting is the [[spear]], launched by a [[Woomera (spear-thrower)|woomera]] or spear-thrower in some locales. Boomerangs were also used by some mainland Indigenous Australians. The non-returnable boomerang (known more correctly as a [[Throwing Stick]]), more powerful than the returning kind, could be used to injure or even kill a kangaroo.\n\nOn mainland Australia no animal other than the dingo and the [[Short-finned eel]] were [[domestication|domesticated]], however domestic pigs and [[cassowaries]] were utilised by Torres Strait Islanders.<ref>Davies, S. J. J. F. (2002). Ratites and Tinamous. Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0-19-854996-2}}</ref> The typical Aboriginal diet included a wide variety of foods, such as pig, [[kangaroo]], [[emu]], [[wombat]]s, [[goanna]], snakes, birds, many insects such as [[honeypot ant|honey ants]], [[Bogong moth]]s and [[witchetty grub]]s. Many varieties of plant foods such as [[taro]], [[coconut]]s, nuts, fruits and berries were also eaten.\n\n===Culture===\n[[File:Lomandra textiles.jpg|thumb|220px|left|''Lomandra'', a plant used by Aboriginal Australians for weaving]]\nPermanent villages were the norm for most Torres Strait Island communities. In some areas mainland Aboriginal Australians also lived in semi-permanent villages, most usually in less arid areas where fishing could provide for a more settled existence. Most Indigenous communities were [[semi-nomadic]], moving in a regular cycle over a defined territory, following [[seasonal food]] sources and returning to the same places at the same time each year. From the examination of [[midden]]s, archaeologists have shown that some localities were visited annually by Indigenous communities for thousands of years. In the more arid areas Aboriginal Australians were nomadic, ranging over wide areas in search of scarce food resources. There is evidence of substantial change in indigenous culture over time. [[Rock painting]] at several locations in northern Australia has been shown to consist of a sequence of different styles linked to different historical periods. There is also prominent [[Sydney rock engravings|rock paintings found in the Sydney basin]] area which date to around 5,000 years.\n\n[[Harry Lourandos]] has been the leading proponent of the theory that a period of hunter-gatherer intensification occurred between 3000 and 1000 BCE. Intensification involved an increase in human manipulation of the environment (for example, the construction of eel traps in Victoria), population growth, an increase in trade between groups, a more elaborate social structure, and other cultural changes. A shift in [[stone tool]] technology, involving the development of smaller and more intricate points and scrapers, occurred around this time. This was probably also associated with the introduction to the mainland of the Australian dingo.\n\nMany Indigenous communities also have a very complex [[Australian Aboriginal kinship|kinship]] structure and in some places strict rules about marriage. In traditional societies, men are required to marry women of a specific [[Moiety (kinship)|moiety]]. The system is still alive in many Central Australian communities. To enable men and women to find suitable partners, many groups would come together for annual gatherings (commonly known as [[corroboree]]s) at which goods were traded, news exchanged, and marriages arranged amid appropriate ceremonies. This practice both reinforced clan relationships and prevented [[inbreeding]] in a society based on small semi-nomadic groups.\n\n==Impact of British colonisation==\n{{See also|European exploration of Australia|History of Australia (1788\u20131850)|Australian frontier wars}}\n\n===1788\u20131900, European settlement===\n[[File:Native Encampment by Skinner Prout, from Australia (1876, vol II).jpg|thumb|upright=1.75|right|A 19th-century engraving of an Aboriginal Australian encampment, showing the indigenous lifestyle in the cooler parts of Australia at the time of European settlement.]]\nIn 1770, Lieutenant [[James Cook]] wrote that he had claimed the east coast of Australia for the [[United Kingdom]] and named it New South Wales, while on [[Possession Island (Queensland)|Possession Island]] off the west coast of [[Cape York Peninsula]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Beaglehole |first1=J.C. |title=The Journals of Captain James Cook, Vol.1 |date=1955 |publisher=Hakluyt Society |location=Cambridge |isbn=978-0851157443 |page=387}}</ref> However, it seems that no such claim was made when Cook was in Australia.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cameron-Ash |first1=M. |title=Lying for the Admiralty |date=2018 |publisher=Rosenberg |isbn=9780648043966 |pages=180\u2013184}}</ref> Cook was not authorized to make such a claim and Joseph Banks, who was standing beside Cook, does not mention the event.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Banks |first1=Joseph |title=The Endeavour Journal of Joseph Banks, vol.2 |date=1962 |publisher=Angus & Robertson |location=Sydney |page=110}}</ref> Furthermore, Cook's purported declaration was made unilaterally and without any consultation with First Australians, in spite of his direct written orders from The Admiralty, which instructed him to conclude a treaty with the inhabitants (if any) and obtain their permission for the expropriation of land. British colonisation of Australia began in Sydney in 1788.\n\nThe first apparent consequence of British settlement appeared in April 1789 when a disease, which was probably [[smallpox]], struck the Aborigines about [[Port Jackson]].<ref>{{cite book |last1=Frost |first1=Alan |title=Botany Bay Mirages |date=1994 |publisher=Melbourne University Press |isbn=9780522844979 |pages=190\u2013210}}</ref> Thereafter, other European epidemic diseases arrived such as [[chickenpox]], [[influenza]] and [[measles]], which spread in advance of the frontier of settlement. The worst-hit communities were the ones with the greatest population densities, where disease could spread more readily. In the arid centre of the continent, where small communities were spread over a vast area, the population decline was less marked. Disease was the principal cause of population decline.\n\nThe second consequence of British settlement was appropriation of land and water resources. The settlers took the view that Aboriginal Australians were nomads with no concept of land ownership, who could be driven off land wanted for farming or grazing and who would be just as happy somewhere else. In fact the loss of traditional lands, food sources and water resources was often fatal, particularly to communities already weakened by disease. Additionally, Aboriginal Australians groups had a deep spiritual and cultural connection to the land, so that in being forced to move away from traditional areas, cultural and spiritual practices necessary to the cohesion and well-being of the group could not be maintained. Proximity to settlers also brought [[venereal disease]], to which Aboriginal Australians had no tolerance and which greatly reduced Aboriginal fertility and birthrates. Settlers also brought alcohol, opium and tobacco, and [[substance abuse]] has remained a chronic problem for Aboriginal communities ever since.  Entire communities in the moderately fertile southern part of the continent simply vanished without trace, often before European settlers recorded their existence. \n\n====Diseases====\nDeadly [[Infectious disease#Historic pandemics|infectious diseases]] like smallpox, influenza and [[tuberculosis]] were always major causes of Aboriginal deaths.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.mup.unimelb.edu.au/catalogue/0-522-84939-3.html |title=Invisible Invaders |access-date=7 January 2008 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070904065707/http://www.mup.unimelb.edu.au/catalogue/0-522-84939-3.html |archive-date=4 September 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> \nSmallpox alone killed more than 50% of the Aboriginal population.<ref name=\"Smallpox Through History\"/>\n\nIn April 1789, a major outbreak of smallpox killed large numbers of Indigenous Australians between [[Hawkesbury River]], [[Broken Bay]], and [[Port Hacking]]. Based on information recorded in the journals of some members of the [[First Fleet]], it has been surmised that the Aborigines of the Sydney region had never encountered the disease before and lacked immunity to it. Unable to understand or counter the sickness, they often fled, leaving the sick with some food and water to fend for themselves. As the clans fled, the epidemic spread further along the coast and into the hinterland. This had a disastrous effect on Aboriginal society; with many of the productive [[hunters and gatherers]] dead, those who survived the initial outbreak began to starve.{{citation needed|date=March 2019}}\n\nLieutenant [[William Bradley (New South Wales colonial politician)|William Bradley]] recorded the first indications of the severity of the disaster that had struck the Aboriginal population of Sydney when he described his shock at the small number of them to be seen on the harbour and its shores compared with previous times. The British had not seen smallpox in anyone among themselves before the outbreak. Although there were fears about the health of some of the convicts on the First Fleet, these were subsequently dismissed by Surgeon-General John White, who believed they were suffering from \"slight inflammatory complaints\".<ref>John White, ''Journal of a Voyage to New South Wales with Sixty-five Plates of Non Descript Animals, Birds, Lizards, Serpents, Curious Cones of Trees and Other Natural Productions'', London, 1795, p. 4.</ref>\n\nSome commentators, such as Judy Campbell,<ref>{{cite book |title=Judy Campbell, Invisible Invaders|publisher=Melbourne University Press|date=1998|isbn=9780522849394}}</ref> have suggested that [[Makassan contact with Australia|Makasar]] fishermen accidentally brought smallpox to Australia's north and the virus travelled south. However, given that the spread of the disease depends on high population densities, and the fact that those who succumbed were soon incapable of walking, such an outbreak was unlikely to have spread across the desert trade routes. A more likely source of the disease was the \"variolas matter\" Surgeon John White brought with him on the [[First Fleet]], although it is unknown how this may have been spread.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nma.gov.au/defining-moments/resources/smallpox-epidemic|website=National Museum Australia|title=Smallpox epidemic|series=Defining moments|accessdate=1 March 2019}} (Includes further citations)</ref> It has been speculated that the vials were either accidentally or intentionally released it as a \"[[biological weapon]]\".<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-180278188.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110831054140/http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-180278188.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2011-08-31 |title=The origin of the smallpox outbreak in Sydney in 1789 |journal=Journal of the Royal Australian Historical Society |author=Mear, Craig |accessdate=11 May 2013|date=June 2008 }}</ref> Some researchers, such as Seth Carus<ref>Distinguished Research Fellow, Center for the Study of WMD, National Defense University, Ft.

However the methodology behind figures such as this one has been criticised due to the fact that only white deaths were documented in frontier conflicts, forcing historians to estimate a country-wide white-black death ratio in violent confrontations and infer from this the number of Aboriginal deaths.<ref>Windshuttle, The Fabrication of the Aboriginal Death Toll', in Quadrant, November 2000, p. 21.</ref> Reynolds, and other historians, estimate that up to 3,000 [[white people]] were killed by Aboriginal Australians in the frontier violence.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.kooriweb.org/foley/news/story28.html |title=The Statistics of Frontier Conflict |access-date=26 August 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171009084602/http://www.kooriweb.org/foley/news/story28.html |archive-date=9 October 2017 |url-status=dead }}</ref> By the 1870s all the fertile areas of Australia had been appropriated, and Aboriginal communities reduced to impoverished remnants living either on the fringes of European communities or on lands considered unsuitable for settlement.\n\nThe [[Aboriginal Tasmanian|Palawa]], or Indigenous people of Tasmania, were particularly hard-hit. Nearly all of them, apparently numbering somewhere between 2,000 and 15,000 when white settlement began, were dead by the 1870s. It is widely claimed that this was the result of a [[genocide|genocidal policy]], in the form of the \"[[Black War]]\". Other historians dispute this. [[Geoffrey Blainey]] wrote that, in Tasmania, by 1830: \"Disease had killed most of them but warfare and private violence had also been devastating.\"<ref>Blainey, Geoffrey : A Land Half Won, Macmillan, South Melbourne, Vic., 1980, p 75</ref> [[Josephine Flood]] wrote: \"The catastrophic death rate was due to new diseases, particularly pulmonary and sexually transmitted ones.\"<ref>Flood, Josephine: The Original Australians: Story of the Aboriginal People, Allen & Unwin, 2006 {{ISBN|978-1741148725}}, p89</ref> Historian [[Keith Windschuttle]] also disagrees that violence was the principal cause. He argues that there are plausible recorded accounts of approximately 120 Aboriginal Tasmanians killed in 1803\u201347, that there were an unknown number of unrecorded killings and that many of these were killed in 'self-defence' by settlers. Windschuttle argues some accounts of killings are implausible for a variety of reasons such as incidents involving improbably large death tolls given the muzzle-loading, single-shot muskets in use and that the low number of plausible recorded killings is one indicator of a relatively low level of conflict.<ref>Windschuttle, Keith (2002).

Willis, has subsequently disputed Windschuttle's figures and has documented 188 Palawa killed by settlers in 1803\u201334 alone, with possibly another 145 killed during the same period.<ref>Cited in [https://books.google.com/books?id=h0Ph5GLwWOQC&dq Josephine Flood, 2006, ''The Original Australians: Story of the Aboriginal People''], Allen & Unwin, ({{ISBN|1-74114-872-3}}) p.86.</ref> Such counts do not consider undocumented violence and must be regarded as minimum estimates.<ref>Flood, ''Ibid''</ref> It is also claimed, but untrue, that the last Aboriginal Tasmanian was [[Truganini]], who died in 1876. This belief stems from a distinction between \"full bloods\" and \"[[half-caste|half castes]]\" that is now generally regarded as racist. Palawa people survived, in [[Mission (Christian)|mission]]s set up on the islands of Bass Strait.\n[[File:JM Crossland - Portrait of Nannultera, a young Poonindie cricketer.jpg|thumb|right|This portrait of a young Indigenous boy was commissioned by a member of a Christian mission station to show the achievements of the mission at \"civilising\" the Indigenous population.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://artsearch.nga.gov.au/Detail.cfm?IRN=62236 |title=Portrait of Nannultera, a young Poonindie cricketer |last=Radford |first=Ron |work=Collection highlights: National Gallery of Australia |publisher=National Gallery of Australia |year=2010 |accessdate=11 June 2015}}</ref>]]\n\nNevertheless, some initial contact between Aboriginal people and Europeans was peaceful, starting with the [[Guugu Yimithirr people|Guugu Yimithirr]] people who met James Cook near [[Cooktown, Queensland|Cooktown]] in 1770. [[Bennelong]] served as [[interlocutor (politics)|interlocutor]] between the Eora people of Sydney and the British colony, and was the first Aboriginal Australian to travel to England, staying there between 1792 and 1795. Aboriginal people were known to help European explorers, such as [[John King (explorer)|John King]], who lived with a tribe for two and a half months after the ill-fated [[Burke and Wills expedition]] of 1861. Also living with Indigenous people was [[William Buckley (convict)|William Buckley]], an escaped convict, who was with the [[Wautharong]] people near Melbourne for thirty-two years, before being found in 1835. Many Indigenous people adapted to European culture, working as stock hands or labourers. The first Australian [[cricket]] team, which toured England in 1868, was principally made up of Indigenous players.\n\n====Agriculture====\nAs the European [[transhumance|pastoral]] industries developed, several economic changes came about. The appropriation of prime land and the spread of European livestock over vast areas made a traditional Indigenous lifestyle less viable, but also provided a ready alternative supply of fresh meat for those prepared to incur the settlers' anger by hunting livestock. The impact of disease and the settlers' industries had a profound impact on the Indigenous Australians' way of life. With the exception of a few in the remote interior, all surviving Indigenous communities gradually became dependent on the settler population for their livelihood.\n\nIn south-eastern Australia, during the 1850s, large numbers of white pastoral workers deserted employment on stations for the [[Australian goldrushes]]. Indigenous women, men and children became a significant source of labour. Most Indigenous labour was unpaid, instead Indigenous workers received rations in the form of food, clothing and other basic necessities. In the later 19th century, settlers made their way north and into the interior, appropriating small but vital parts of the land for their own exclusive use (waterholes and soaks in particular), and introducing sheep, [[rabbits in Australia|rabbits]] and [[cattle]], all three of which ate out previously fertile areas and degraded the ability of the land to carry the native animals that were vital to Indigenous economies. Indigenous hunters would often spear sheep and cattle, incurring the wrath of graziers, after they replaced the native animals as a food source. As large sheep and cattle stations came to dominate northern Australia, Indigenous workers were quickly recruited. Several other outback industries, notably [[pearl]]ing, also employed Aboriginal workers.\n\nIn many areas Christian missions provided food and clothing for Indigenous communities and also opened schools and orphanages for Indigenous children. In some places colonial governments provided some resources.\n\n===1900\u20131940s===\n[[File:SLNSW 75764 Warriors in Ambush series 49 Aboriginal Mystic Bora Ceremony.jpg|thumb|upright=1.75|Aboriginal Bora ceremony (early 20th century)]]\nIn spite of the impact of disease, violence and the spread of foreign settlement and custom, some Indigenous communities in remote desert and tropical rainforest areas survived according to traditional means until well into the 20th century. In 1914 around 800 Aboriginal people<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.awm.gov.au/blog/2008/04/24/aboriginal-anzacs/ |title=Aboriginal ANZACS |publisher=Australian War Memorial |first=Robyn |last=Van Dyk |date=24 April 2008}}</ref> answered the call to arms to fight in [[World War I]], despite restrictions on Indigenous Australians serving in the military. As the war continued, these restrictions were relaxed as more recruits were needed. Many enlisted by claiming they were [[M\u0101ori people|M\u0101ori]] or [[Historical definitions of races in India|Indian]].<ref>{{cite episode\n | title = Lest We Forget\n | url = http://www.abc.net.au/tv/messagestick/stories/s1904340.htm\n | series = Message Stick\n | serieslink = Message Stick\n | airdate = 23 April 2007\n | season = 9\n | number = 10 }}</ref>\n\nBy the 1920s, the Indigenous population had declined to between 50,000 and 90,000, and the belief that the Indigenous Australians would soon die out was widely held, even among Australians sympathetic to their situation. But by about 1930, those Indigenous Australians who had survived had acquired better resistance to imported diseases, and birthrates began to rise again as communities were able to adapt to changed circumstances. From the 1940s, the availability of [[penicillin]] to treat imported diseases also had a marked effect on reversing the population decline.\n\nIn the Northern Territory, significant frontier conflict continued. Both isolated Europeans and visiting Asian fishermen were killed by hunter gatherers until the start of [[World War II]] in 1939. It is known that some European settlers in the centre and north of the country shot Indigenous people during this period. One particular series of killings became known as the [[Caledon Bay crisis]], and became a watershed in the relationship between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians.\n\nIn the early 20th century, anthropologists' influence dominated society's view of aboriginals in Australia. They were viewed as a different race that was not as evolved as Europeans. Starting in the 1880 and continuing into the 20th century, debate continued on where between ape and man could the aboriginal be situated in evolutionary terms. In the mid-1920s, there was a shift in focus away from physical anthropological issues of race and towards a cultural anthropological concerns established by field-work. New studies described aboriginals' social organisation, religious belief and practice. [[Alfred Radcliffe-Brown]], the father of modern social anthropology, published his ''Social Organization of Australian Tribes'' in 1931.<ref>{{cite book|author=Gillian Cowlishaw|chapter=Australian Aboriginal studies: The anthropologists' accounts|title=The Cultural Construction of Race|editor=M. de Lepervanche|editor2=G.

However, Aboriginal workers remained [[unfree labour]]ers, paid only small amounts of cash in addition to rations, and had their movements severely restricted by regulations and/or police action. On 4 February 1939, [[Jack Patten]] led a strike at [[Cummeragunja Station]] in New South Wales. The people of Cummeragunja were protesting their harsh treatment under what was a draconian system. A once successful farming enterprise was taken from their control, and residents were forced to subsist on meagre rations. Approximately 200 people left their homes, taking part in the [[Cummeragunja walk-off]], and the majority crossed the border into Victoria, never to return home.<ref>http://www.koorihistory.com/jack-patten/ Koori History: Remembering Jack Patten</ref>\n\nOn 1 May 1946, Aboriginal peoples station workers in the beautiful region of Western Australia started the [[1946 Pilbara strike]] and never returned to work. Mass layoffs across northern Australia followed the Federal [[Pastoral Industry Award]] of 1968, which required the payment of a [[minimum wage]] to Aboriginal station workers, as they were not paid by the Pastoralist discretion, many however were not and those who were had their money held by the government. Many of the workers and their families became [[refugees]] or [[fringe dwellers]], living in camps on the outskirts of towns and cities.\n\n==1940s\u2013present==\n{{See also|Stolen Generations|Republicanism in Australia}}\n\nIn 1949, the right to vote in federal elections was extended to Indigenous Australians who had served in the armed forces, or were enrolled to vote in state elections. At that time, those Indigenous Australians who lived in Queensland, Western Australia and the Northern Territory were still ineligible to vote in state elections, consequently they did not have the right to vote in federal elections.\n\nAll Indigenous Australians were given the right to vote in Commonwealth elections in Australia by the [[Robert Menzies|Menzies]] government in 1962.<ref>[http://www.aec.gov.au/Voting/indigenous_vote/indigenous.htm Australian Electoral Commission - Electoral Milestone / Timetable for Indigenous Australians]</ref> The first federal election in which all Aboriginal Australians could vote was held in [[1963 Australian federal election|November 1963]]. The right to vote in state elections was granted in Western Australia in 1962 and Queensland was the last state to do so in 1965.\n\nThe [[Australian referendum, 1967 (Aboriginals)|1967 referendum]], passed with a 90% majority, allowed Indigenous Australians to be included in the Commonwealth parliament's power to make special laws for specific races, and to be included in counts to determine electoral representation. This has been the largest affirmative vote in the history of Australia's referendums.\n\nIn 1971, [[Yolngu]] people at [[Yirrkala, Northern Territory|Yirrkala]] sought an injunction against [[Nabalco]] to cease mining on their traditional land. In the resulting historic and controversial [[Gove land rights case]], Justice Blackburn ruled that Australia had been [[terra nullius]] before European settlement, and that no concept of Native title existed in Australian law. Although the [[Yolngu]] people were defeated in this action, the effect was to highlight the absurdity of the law, which led first to the [[Aboriginal Land Rights Commission|Woodward Commission]], and then to the [[Aboriginal Land Rights Act]].\n\nIn 1972, the [[Aboriginal Tent Embassy]] was established on the steps of [[Politics of Australia|Parliament House]] in [[Canberra]], in response to the sentiment among Indigenous Australians that they were \"strangers in their own country\". A Tent Embassy still exists on the same site.\n\nIn 1975, the [[Whitlam]] government drafted the Aboriginal Land Rights Act, which aimed to restore traditional lands to Indigenous people. After the [[Australian constitutional crisis of 1975|dismissal of the Whitlam government]] by the Governor-General, a reduced-scope version of the Act (known as the [[Aboriginal Land Rights Act 1976]]) was introduced by the coalition government led by [[Malcolm Fraser]]. While its application was limited to the Northern Territory, it did grant \"inalienable\" freehold title to some traditional lands.\n\nIn 1984, [[Pintupi Nine|a group of Pintupi]] people who were living a traditional hunter-gatherer desert-dwelling life were tracked down in the [[Gibson Desert]] in Western Australia and brought into a settlement. They are believed to have been the last [[uncontacted peoples|uncontacted tribe]] in Australia.<ref>[http://recollections.nma.gov.au/issues/vol_1_no_2/exhibition_reviews/colliding_worlds/ Colliding worlds: first contact in the western desert, 1932\u20131984]</ref>\n\nA 1987 federal government report described the history of the \"Aboriginal Homelands Movement\" or \"Return to Country movement\" as \"a concerted attempt by Aboriginal people in the 'remote' areas of Australia to leave government settlements, [[Aboriginal reserve|reserves]], missions and non-Aboriginal townships and to re-occupy their traditional country.\"<ref name=RepsCountry>{{cite web|title=Return to Country: The Aboriginal Homelands Movement in Australia|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/house/committee/reports/1987/1987_PP125A.pdf|publisher=Australian Government Publishing Service}}</ref>\n\nIn 1992, the Australian High Court handed down its decision in the [[Mabo v Queensland (No 2) (1992)|Mabo Case]], declaring the previous legal concept of ''[[terra nullius]]'' to be invalid. This decision legally recognised certain land claims of Indigenous Australians in Australia prior to British Settlement. Legislation was subsequently enacted and later amended to recognise [[Native Title]] claims over land in Australia.\n\nIn 1998, as the result of an inquiry into the forced removal of Indigenous children (see [[Stolen generation]]) from their families, a [[National Sorry Day]] was instituted, to acknowledge the wrong that had been done to Indigenous families. Many politicians, from both sides of the house, participated, with the notable exception of the Prime Minister, [[John Howard]].\n\nIn 1999 a [[Australian referendum, 1999 (Preamble)|referendum]] was held to change the [[Constitution of Australia|Australian Constitution]] to include a preamble that, amongst other topics, recognised the occupation of Australia by Indigenous Australians prior to British Settlement. This referendum was defeated, though the recognition of Indigenous Australians in the preamble was not a major issue in the referendum discussion, and the preamble question attracted minor attention compared to the question of becoming a republic.\n\nIn 2004, the Australian Government abolished The [[Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission]] (ATSIC), which had been Australia's top Indigenous organisation. The Commonwealth cited corruption and, in particular, made allegations concerning the misuse of public funds by ATSIC's chairman, [[Geoff Clark (politician)|Geoff Clark]], as the principal reason. Indigenous specific programmes have been [[mainstream]]ed, that is, reintegrated and transferred to departments and agencies serving the general population. The [[Office of Indigenous Policy Coordination]] was established within the then [[Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Australia)|Department of Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs]], and now with the [[Department of Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs (Australia)|Department of Families, Community Services and Indigenous Affairs]] to coordinate a \"whole of government\" effort.\n\nIn June 2005, [[Richard Frankland]], founder of the '[[Your Voice]]' political party, in an open letter to Prime Minister John Howard, advocated that the eighteenth-century conflicts between Aboriginal and colonial Australians \"be recognised as wars and be given the same attention as the other wars receive within the [[Australian War Memorial]]\". In its editorial on 20 June 2005, Melbourne newspaper, [[The Age]], said that \"Frankland has raised an important question,\" and asked whether moving \"work commemorating Aborigines who lost their lives defending their land ... to the War Memorial [would] change the way we regard Aboriginal history.\"\n\nIn 2008, Prime Minister [[Kevin Rudd]] made a formal [[Stolen generations#Australian federal parliament apology|apology for the Stolen Generations]].\n\n==See also==\n*[[Aboriginal Australians]]\n* [[Aboriginal history of Western Australia]]\n* [[Aboriginal reserve]]\n* [[Australian archaeology]]\n* ''[[Aboriginal History]]'' (journal)\n*[[Aboriginal land rights in Australia]]\n* [[Aboriginal Tasmanians]]\n*[[Aboriginal title in Australia]]\n*''[[Bringing them home]]'' report (1997)\n* [[Dark Emu (book)|''Dark Emu'']], book by [[Bruce Pascoe]]\n*[[History of Indigenous Australian self-determination]]\n* [[History wars]]\n*[[Indigenous Australians]]\n* [[List of Aboriginal missions in New South Wales]]\n* [[List of Indigenous Australian firsts]]\n* [[List of massacres of Indigenous Australians]]\n* [[Stolen Generations]]\n\n==References==\n{{Reflist|30em}}\n\n==Further reading==\n* Australian Institute of Aboriginal, and Torres Strait Islander Studies.

Both clans were very proud of the purity of their royal blood and had practised this tradition of inter-marriage since ancient times. For example, [[\u015buddhodana|Suddhodana's]] paternal aunt was married to the Koliyan ruler [[A\u00f1jana]]. Their daughters, [[Mayadevi|Mahamaya]] and [[Mahaprajapati|Mahapajapati Gotami]], were married to [[\u015auddhodana]], the chief of the [[Shakya|Sakyans]]. Similarly, [[Yashodhara]], daughter of [[Suppabuddha]], who was [[A\u00f1jana]]'s son, was married to the Sakyan prince, [[Gautama Buddha]]. Thus, the two royal families were related by marriage bonds between maternal and paternal cousins since ancient times. In spite of such close blood-ties, there would be occasional rifts between the two royal families, which sometimes turned into open hostility.\n\n=== Early ===\nRecords of Koli people exist from at least the 15th century, when rulers in the present-day Gujarat region noted their chieftains as being marauding robbers and [[dacoit]]s. Over a period of several centuries, some of them were able to establish petty chiefdoms throughout the region, mostly comprising just a single village. Although not [[Rajput]]s, this relatively small subset of the Kolis claimed the status of the higher-ranked Rajput community, adopting their customs and intermixing with less significant Rajput families through the practice of [[hypergamy|hypergamous]] marriage,{{sfn|Shah|2012|p=169|ps=}}{{sfn|Jaffrelot|2003|pp=180-182|ps=}} which was commonly used to enhance or secure social status.{{sfn|Fuller|1975|pp=293-295|ps=}} There were significant differences in status throughout the Koli community, however, and little cohesion either geographically or in terms of communal norms, such as the establishment of endogamous marriage groups.{{sfn|Shah|2012|p=170|ps=}}\n\nThrough the colonial [[British Raj]] period and into the 20th century, some Kolis remained significant landholders and tenants,{{sfn|Jaffrelot|2003|pp=180-182|ps=}} although most had never been more than minor landowners and labourers.{{sfn|Shah|2012|p=170|ps=}} The term ''[[Darbar (title)|Darbar]]'' is used to/by kolis. Darbar is equal to ''[[Kshatriya]].'' By this time, however, most Kolis had lost their once-equal standing with the [[Patidar]]{{efn|The Patidars were formerly known as [[Kanbi]], but by 1931 had gained official recognition as Patidar.{{sfn|Basu|2009|pp=51-55|ps=}}}} community due to the land reforms of the Raj period.{{sfn|Basu|2009|pp=51-55|ps=}}.\n\n=== Twentieth century ===\nDuring the later period of the Raj, the Gujarati Kolis became involved in the process of what has subsequently been termed [[sanskritisation]]. At that time, in the 1930s, they represented around 20 percent of the region's population and members of the local Rajput community were seeking to extend their own influence by co-opting other significant groups as claimants to the [[Varna (Hinduism)|ritual title]] of [[Kshatriya]]. The Rajputs were politically, economically and socially marginalised because their own numbers&nbsp;\u2014 around 4 - 5 per cent of the population&nbsp;\u2014 were inferior to the dominant Patidars, with whom the Kolis were also disenchanted. The Kolis were among those whom the Rajputs targeted because, although classified as a [[Criminal Tribes|criminal tribe]] by the British administration, they were among the many communities of that period who had made genealogical claims of descent from the Kshatriya. The Rajput leaders preferred to view the Kolis as being Kshatriya by dint of military ethos rather than origin but, in whatever terminology, it was a marriage of political expedience.{{sfn|Jaffrelot|2003|pp=180-182|ps=}}\n\nIn 1947, around the time that [[Independence of India|India gained independence]], the Kutch, Kathiawar, Gujarat Kshatriya Sabha (KKGKS) caste association emerged as an [[umbrella organisation]] to continue the work begun during the Raj. [[Christophe Jaffrelot]], a French political scientist, says that this body, which claimed to represent the Rajputs and Kolis, \"...&nbsp;is a good example of the way castes, with very different ritual status, join hands to defend their common interests.&nbsp;... The use of the word Kshatriya was largely tactical and the original caste identity was seriously diluted.\"{{sfn|Jaffrelot|2003|pp=180-182|ps=}}\n\nThe relevance of the Kshatriya label in terms of ritual was diminished by the practical actions of the KKGKS which, among other things, saw demands for the constituent communities to be classified as [[Other Backward Class|Backward Classes]] in the Indian [[Reservation in India|scheme for positive discrimination]]. Kshatriyas would not usually wish to be associated with such a category and indeed it runs counter to the theory of Sanskritisation, but in this instance, it suited the socio-economic and political desires. By the 1950s, the KKGKS had established schools, loan systems and other mechanisms of communal self-help and it was demanding reforms to laws relating to land. It was also seeking alliances with political parties at the state level; initially, with the [[Indian National Congress]] and then, by the early 1960s, with the [[Swatantra Party]].\n\nBy 1967, the KKGKS was once again working with Congress because, despite being a haven for Patidars, the party leadership needed the votes of the KKGKS membership. The Kolis gained more from the actions of the KKGKS in these two decades than did the Rajputs, and Jaffrelot believes that it was around this time that a Koli intelligentsia emerged.{{sfn|Jaffrelot|2003|pp=180-182|ps=}} Ghanshyam Shah, a professor at Jawaharlal Nehru University, describes the organisation today as covering a broad group of communities, from disadvantaged Rajputs of high prestige to the semi-tribal [[Bhil people|Bhil]]s, with the Kolis in the middle. He notes that its composition reflects \"a common economic interest and a growing secular identity born partly out of folklore but more out of common resentment against the well-to-do castes\".{{sfn|Shah|2004|p=178|ps=}}\n\nThe Kolis of Gujarat remained educationally and occupationally disadvantaged compared to communities such as the [[Brahmin]]s and Patidars.{{sfn|Shah|2004|p=302|ps=}} Their many [[J\u0101ti]]s include the [[Baria (caste)|Bareeya]], [[Khant caste|Khant]], [[Patanwadia]], [[Talpada]], Chunvalia and [[Thakor]], and they also use ''Koli'' as a suffix, giving rise to groups such as the Gulam Koli and Matia Koli.

Both clans were very proud of the purity of their royal blood and had practised this tradition of inter-marriage since ancient times. For example, [[\u015buddhodana|Suddhodana's]] paternal aunt was married to the Koliyan ruler [[A\u00f1jana]]. Their daughters, [[Mayadevi|Mahamaya]] and [[Mahaprajapati|Mahapajapati Gotami]], were married to [[\u015auddhodana]], the chief of the [[Shakya|Sakyans]]. Similarly, [[Yashodhara]], daughter of [[Suppabuddha]], who was [[A\u00f1jana]]'s son, was married to the Sakyan prince, [[Gautama Buddha]]. Thus, the two royal families were related by marriage bonds between maternal and paternal cousins since ancient times. In spite of such close blood-ties, there would be occasional rifts between the two royal families, which sometimes turned into open hostility.\n\n=== Early ===\nRecords of Koli people exist from at least the 15th century, when rulers in the present-day Gujarat region noted their chieftains as being marauding robbers and [[dacoit]]s. Over a period of several centuries, some of them were able to establish petty chiefdoms throughout the region, mostly comprising just a single village. Although not [[Rajput]]s, this relatively small subset of the Kolis claimed the status of the higher-ranked Rajput community, adopting their customs and intermixing with less significant Rajput families through the practice of [[hypergamy|hypergamous]] marriage,{{sfn|Shah|2012|p=169|ps=}}{{sfn|Jaffrelot|2003|pp=180-182|ps=}} which was commonly used to enhance or secure social status.{{sfn|Fuller|1975|pp=293-295|ps=}} There were significant differences in status throughout the Koli community, however, and little cohesion either geographically or in terms of communal norms, such as the establishment of endogamous marriage groups.{{sfn|Shah|2012|p=170|ps=}}\n\nThrough the colonial [[British Raj]] period and into the 20th century, some Kolis remained significant landholders and tenants,{{sfn|Jaffrelot|2003|pp=180-182|ps=}} although most had never been more than minor landowners and labourers.{{sfn|Shah|2012|p=170|ps=}} The term ''[[Darbar (title)|Darbar]]'' is used to/by kolis. Darbar is equal to ''[[Kshatriya]].'' By this time, however, most Kolis had lost their once-equal standing with the [[Patidar]]{{efn|The Patidars were formerly known as [[Kanbi]], but by 1931 had gained official recognition as Patidar.{{sfn|Basu|2009|pp=51-55|ps=}}}} community due to the land reforms of the Raj period.{{sfn|Basu|2009|pp=51-55|ps=}}.\n\n=== Twentieth century ===\nDuring the later period of the Raj, the Gujarati Kolis became involved in the process of what has subsequently been termed [[sanskritisation]]. At that time, in the 1930s, they represented around 20 percent of the region's population and members of the local Rajput community were seeking to extend their own influence by co-opting other significant groups as claimants to the [[Varna (Hinduism)|ritual title]] of [[Kshatriya]]. The Rajputs were politically, economically and socially marginalised because their own numbers&nbsp;\u2014 around 4 - 5 per cent of the population&nbsp;\u2014 were inferior to the dominant Patidars, with whom the Kolis were also disenchanted. The Kolis were among those whom the Rajputs targeted because, although classified as a [[Criminal Tribes|criminal tribe]] by the British administration, they were among the many communities of that period who had made genealogical claims of descent from the Kshatriya. The Rajput leaders preferred to view the Kolis as being Kshatriya by dint of military ethos rather than origin but, in whatever terminology, it was a marriage of political expedience.{{sfn|Jaffrelot|2003|pp=180-182|ps=}}\n\nIn 1947, around the time that [[Independence of India|India gained independence]], the Kutch, Kathiawar, Gujarat Kshatriya Sabha (KKGKS) caste association emerged as an [[umbrella organisation]] to continue the work begun during the Raj. [[Christophe Jaffrelot]], a French political scientist, says that this body, which claimed to represent the Rajputs and Kolis, \"...&nbsp;is a good example of the way castes, with very different ritual status, join hands to defend their common interests.&nbsp;... The use of the word Kshatriya was largely tactical and the original caste identity was seriously diluted.\"{{sfn|Jaffrelot|2003|pp=180-182|ps=}}\n\nThe relevance of the Kshatriya label in terms of ritual was diminished by the practical actions of the KKGKS which, among other things, saw demands for the constituent communities to be classified as [[Other Backward Class|Backward Classes]] in the Indian [[Reservation in India|scheme for positive discrimination]]. Kshatriyas would not usually wish to be associated with such a category and indeed it runs counter to the theory of Sanskritisation, but in this instance, it suited the socio-economic and political desires. By the 1950s, the KKGKS had established schools, loan systems and other mechanisms of communal self-help and it was demanding reforms to laws relating to land. It was also seeking alliances with political parties at the state level; initially, with the [[Indian National Congress]] and then, by the early 1960s, with the [[Swatantra Party]].\n\nBy 1967, the KKGKS was once again working with Congress because, despite being a haven for Patidars, the party leadership needed the votes of the KKGKS membership. The Kolis gained more from the actions of the KKGKS in these two decades than did the Rajputs, and Jaffrelot believes that it was around this time that a Koli intelligentsia emerged.{{sfn|Jaffrelot|2003|pp=180-182|ps=}} Ghanshyam Shah, a professor at Jawaharlal Nehru University, describes the organisation today as covering a broad group of communities, from disadvantaged Rajputs of high prestige to the semi-tribal [[Bhil people|Bhil]]s, with the Kolis in the middle. He notes that its composition reflects \"a common economic interest and a growing secular identity born partly out of folklore but more out of common resentment against the well-to-do castes\".{{sfn|Shah|2004|p=178|ps=}}\n\nThe Kolis of Gujarat remained educationally and occupationally disadvantaged compared to communities such as the [[Brahmin]]s and Patidars.{{sfn|Shah|2004|p=302|ps=}} Their many [[J\u0101ti]]s include the [[Baria (caste)|Bareeya]], [[Khant caste|Khant]], [[Patanwadia]], [[Talpada]], Chunvalia and [[Thakor]], and they also use ''Koli'' as a suffix, giving rise to groups such as the Gulam Koli and Matia Koli. Some do not refer to themselves as Koli at all.{{sfn|Shah|2004|p=221|ps=}}\n\n== Military Involvement ==\nThe kolis of maharashtra played an important role from pre-maratha time.
