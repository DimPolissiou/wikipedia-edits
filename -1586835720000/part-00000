The group was formed at Liberty University in [[Lynchburg, Virginia]] in 1987 by [[tobyMac|Toby McKeehan]], [[Michael Tait]], and [[Kevin Max|Kevin Max Smith]]. They released five major studio albums together: ''[[DC Talk (album)|DC Talk]]'' (1989), ''[[Nu Thang]]'' (1990), ''[[Free at Last (DC Talk album)|Free at Last]]'' (1992), ''[[Jesus Freak (album)|Jesus Freak]]'' (1995), and ''[[Supernatural (DC Talk album)|Supernatural]]'' (1998). In 2002, the ''Encyclopedia of Contemporary Christian Music'' called DC Talk \"the most popular overtly Christian act of all time.\"<ref name=\"EncyclopediaofCCM\">{{cite book |last = Powell |first = Mark Allan |title = Encyclopedia of Contemporary Christian Music |publisher = Hendrickson Publishers |year = 2002 |location = Peabody, Massachusetts |pages = [https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofco00mark/page/239 239\u201342] |isbn = 1-56563-679-1 |url-access = registration |url = https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofco00mark/page/239 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2001, the group released an EP titled ''[[Solo (dc Talk album)|Solo]],'' which contained two solo songs from each member. Since that time, DC Talk has been on an indefinite hiatus, and the three band members all have led solo careers. They performed and recorded individual songs together several times during the 2000s, although the group never officially reunited or disbanded.\n\nThe group's musical style evolved significantly throughout its career. Its first two releases, ''DC Talk'' and ''Nu Thang,'' were of the [[hip hop music|hip hop]] genre. DC Talk's third album, ''Free at Last,'' also mainly took influence from the hip hop style, although the group's music began taking on a [[rock music|rock]] sound. The trio's last two albums, ''Jesus Freak'' and ''Supernatural,'' were predominantly [[pop rock]]. They are currently on hiatus and no announcements of new albums have been made. In 2017, the band reunited for a cruise, and did so again in 2019. Additionally, Michael Tait has stated that the band is planning a reunion tour for 2020.<ref name=\"Tour\">{{Citation|title = Michael Tait: dc Talk touring in 2020 and beyond|url = https://myktis.com/2019/06/michael-tait-dc-talk-touring-in-2020-and-beyond/|access-date=June 19, 2018}}</ref>\n\n==History==\n\n===Formation===\nWhile attending [[Liberty University]], Toby McKeehan met Michael Tait, and the two began to perform together.

hop|Christian rap]] and [[Christian rock|rock]] trio. The group was formed at Liberty University in [[Lynchburg, Virginia]] in 1987 by [[tobyMac|Toby McKeehan]], [[Michael Tait]], and [[Kevin Max|Kevin Max Smith]]. They released five major studio albums together: ''[[DC Talk (album)|DC Talk]]'' (1989), ''[[Nu Thang]]'' (1990), ''[[Free at Last (DC Talk album)|Free at Last]]'' (1992), ''[[Jesus Freak (album)|Jesus Freak]]'' (1995), and ''[[Supernatural (DC Talk album)|Supernatural]]'' (1998). In 2002, the ''Encyclopedia of Contemporary Christian Music'' called DC Talk \"the most popular overtly Christian act of all time.\"<ref name=\"EncyclopediaofCCM\">{{cite book |last = Powell |first = Mark Allan |title = Encyclopedia of Contemporary Christian Music |publisher = Hendrickson Publishers |year = 2002 |location = Peabody, Massachusetts |pages = [https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofco00mark/page/239 239\u201342] |isbn = 1-56563-679-1 |url-access = registration |url = https://archive.org/details/encyclopediaofco00mark/page/239 }}</ref>\n\nIn 2001, the group released an EP titled ''[[Solo (dc Talk album)|Solo]],'' which contained two solo songs from each member. Since that time, DC Talk has been on an indefinite hiatus, and the three band members all have led solo careers. They performed and recorded individual songs together several times during the 2000s, although the group never officially reunited or disbanded.\n\nThe group's musical style evolved significantly throughout its career. Its first two releases, ''DC Talk'' and ''Nu Thang,'' were of the [[hip hop music|hip hop]] genre. DC Talk's third album, ''Free at Last,'' also mainly took influence from the hip hop style, although the group's music began taking on a [[rock music|rock]] sound. The trio's last two albums, ''Jesus Freak'' and ''Supernatural,'' were predominantly [[pop rock]]. They are currently on hiatus and no announcements of new albums have been made. In 2017, the band reunited for a cruise, and did so again in 2019.
