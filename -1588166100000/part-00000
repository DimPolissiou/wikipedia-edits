This ethnic and culturally linkage though is more of an overshadowing of Kurdish identity upon the Zaza.<ref name=\"Arakelova 1999 397\u2013408\"/> For centuries, the Zaza have been surrounded by the Kurds, a people with a homogeneous language and close culture. Therefore, outside of the region, the Zaza have always been considered to be a part of the Kurds, or a \"Kurdish tribe\".<ref name=\"Arakelova 1999 397\u2013408\"/>\n\nThis suppression of Zaza autonomy has only been increased in the past century as a result of Kurdish political strivings from multiple resistance movements against the government. These political Turko-Kurdish conflicts put significant twin pressure on the Zaza identity. Intense political agitation around them encourages the Zazas to be part of the \"imagined community\" of Kurds, the biggest 'ethnic grouping' to be without nationhood, while simultaneously admitting that its participants are the very mixed product \u2014 an homogenisation or cultural mosaic of \"tribes\" over millennia.<ref name=\"Trompf 2013 321\u2013344\">{{Cite journal|last=Trompf|first=Garry W.|date=2013|title=Ethno-Religious Minorities in the Near East: Some Macrohistorical Reflections with Special Reference to the Zazas|journal=Iran & the Caucasus|volume=17|issue=3|pages=321\u2013344|jstor=23597500|doi=10.1163/1573384X-20130306}}</ref> Also, Kurdish nationalists play on the point that a large component of so-called Zazas do not want to be called by that name at all, but prefer self-inscribing as [[Kirmanji]], a designation sounding one step away from being [[Kurmanji Kurds|Kurmanji]] speaking Kurds.<ref name=\"Trompf 2013 321\u2013344\"/>\n\nA part of Zazas consider themselves ethnic Kurds and Turks.<ref>[https://www.englishforums.com/English/WhatAboutZazaTurkey/vczn/post.htm Abaut Zaza people]</ref> <ref name=\"Arakelova\">{{cite journal|last1=Arakelova|first1=Victoria|title=The Zaza People as a New Ethno-Political Factor in the Region|journal=Iran & the Caucasus|volume=3/4|pages=397\u2013408|date=1999|jstor=4030804}}</ref> <ref>{{cite book |author1=J.N.

Some linguists connect the word Dimil\u00ee with the Daylamites (Gilaks)  in the [[Alborz Mountains]] near the shores of the Caspian Sea in Iran and believe that the Zaza have migrated from Daylam towards the west.

The lack of documentation, and the decline in the number of native Zaza speakers can largely be attributed to the Turkish laws put in place in the mid-1920s, after the creation of the [[Turkey|Republic of Turkey]]. These laws banned the Kurdish language, of which Zaza was often erroneously considered a dialect, from being spoken in public, being written down, and being published. One specific law, the [[Language Ban Act of 1985]], explicitly stated that only Turkish could be spoken in public, not only greatly discouraged the use of Zaza, but it also endangered the cultural identity of the Zaza.<ref name=\"elliance\"/> The consequences of this process of [[turkification]] were so detrimental that under the Alawi-Zaza population the youngest generations hardly speak the language or teaches it to its children.<ref name=\"Zazaki.de zazaki dimili zaza\">{{Cite web|url=http://zazaki.de/english/index.htm|title=Zazaki.de zazaki dimili zaza|website=zazaki.de|access-date=2018-11-29}}</ref> Only until very recently has Zaza been allowed back in the public sphere of Turkey. But the effects of these past policies are still very present as there has been a lack of literature and substantial development in the language.\n\nDuring the 1980s following the passage of these persecutory laws, the Zaza diaspora resulted in a small renaissance following meager efforts by Zazas in Europe.<ref name=\"Zazaki.de zazaki dimili zaza\"/> This was followed by the publication of magazines and books in Turkey, particularly in Istanbul. The efforts of Zaza intellectuals to advance the comprehensibility of their native language by alphabetizing were not fruitless: the number of publications in Zaza increased by the multiple. The rediscovery of the native culture by Zaza intellectuals not only caused a revival of Zaza language and culture, it also triggered feelings among younger generations of Zazas (who unfortunately, rarely spoke Zaza as a mothertongue at the time) in favor of modern western in the Zaza language, and thus their interest in the most important inheritance of their ancestors.<ref name=\"elliance\"/>\n\nThere is a division between Northern and Southern Zaza, most notably in phonological inventory, but Zaza as a whole forms a dialect continuum, with no recognized standard. Northern Zaza is strongly associated with historical Dersim, and is spoken in the northern and northeastern parts of Elazig province, easter and central Sivas, southern Erzincan, western Erzurum and Bing\u00f6l, and of course, most of Tunceli (the heart of historical Dersim) <ref>[https://elalliance.org/languages/iranic/zaza/ Zaza people and Zaza Language]</ref>\n\n== Connection to Kurds ==\n[[File:Kurdes Zaza de Diarbekir (Kurdistan).jpg|250px|thumb|right|\"Zaza Kurds in [[Diyarbakir]] (Kurdistan)\", E.Chantre & C.Barry, 1881]]\nKurds and Zazas have for centuries lived in the same areas in Anatolia. In the 1920s and 1930s, Zazas played a key role in the rise of Kurdish nationalism with their rebellions against the [[Ottoman Empire]] and later the [[Republic of Turkey]].

This ethnic and culturally linkage though is more of an overshadowing of Kurdish identity upon the Zaza.<ref name=\"Arakelova 1999 397\u2013408\"/> For centuries, the Zaza have been surrounded by the Kurds, a people with a homogeneous language and close culture. Therefore, outside of the region, the Zaza have always been considered to be a part of the Kurds, or a \"Kurdish tribe\".<ref name=\"Arakelova 1999 397\u2013408\"/>\n\nThis suppression of Zaza autonomy has only been increased in the past century as a result of Kurdish political strivings from multiple resistance movements against the government. These political Turko-Kurdish conflicts put significant twin pressure on the Zaza identity. Intense political agitation around them encourages the Zazas to be part of the \"imagined community\" of Kurds, the biggest 'ethnic grouping' to be without nationhood, while simultaneously admitting that its participants are the very mixed product \u2014 an homogenisation or cultural mosaic of \"tribes\" over millennia.<ref name=\"Trompf 2013 321\u2013344\">{{Cite journal|last=Trompf|first=Garry W.|date=2013|title=Ethno-Religious Minorities in the Near East: Some Macrohistorical Reflections with Special Reference to the Zazas|journal=Iran & the Caucasus|volume=17|issue=3|pages=321\u2013344|jstor=23597500|doi=10.1163/1573384X-20130306}}</ref> Also, Kurdish nationalists play on the point that a large component of so-called Zazas do not want to be called by that name at all, but prefer self-inscribing as [[Kirmanji]], a designation sounding one step away from being [[Kurmanji Kurds|Kurmanji]] speaking Kurds.<ref name=\"Trompf 2013 321\u2013344\"/>\n\nA part of Zazas consider themselves ethnic Kurds and Turks.<ref>[https://www.englishforums.com/English/WhatAboutZazaTurkey/vczn/post.htm Abaut Zaza people]</ref> <ref name=\"Arakelova\">{{cite journal|last1=Arakelova|first1=Victoria|title=The Zaza People as a New Ethno-Political Factor in the Region|journal=Iran & the Caucasus|volume=3/4|pages=397\u2013408|date=1999|jstor=4030804}}</ref <ref>{{cite book |author1=J.N.

The lack of documentation, and the decline in the number of native Zaza speakers can largely be attributed to the Turkish laws put in place in the mid-1920s, after the creation of the [[Turkey|Republic of Turkey]]. These laws banned the Kurdish language, of which Zaza was often erroneously considered a dialect, from being spoken in public, being written down, and being published. One specific law, the [[Language Ban Act of 1985]], explicitly stated that only Turkish could be spoken in public, not only greatly discouraged the use of Zaza, but it also endangered the cultural identity of the Zaza.<ref name=\"elliance\"/> The consequences of this process of [[turkification]] were so detrimental that under the Alawi-Zaza population the youngest generations hardly speak the language or teaches it to its children.<ref name=\"Zazaki.de zazaki dimili zaza\">{{Cite web|url=http://zazaki.de/english/index.htm|title=Zazaki.de zazaki dimili zaza|website=zazaki.de|access-date=2018-11-29}}</ref> Only until very recently has Zaza been allowed back in the public sphere of Turkey. But the effects of these past policies are still very present as there has been a lack of literature and substantial development in the language.\n\nDuring the 1980s following the passage of these persecutory laws, the Zaza diaspora resulted in a small renaissance following meager efforts by Zazas in Europe.<ref name=\"Zazaki.de zazaki dimili zaza\"/> This was followed by the publication of magazines and books in Turkey, particularly in Istanbul. The efforts of Zaza intellectuals to advance the comprehensibility of their native language by alphabetizing were not fruitless: the number of publications in Zaza increased by the multiple. The rediscovery of the native culture by Zaza intellectuals not only caused a revival of Zaza language and culture, it also triggered feelings among younger generations of Zazas (who unfortunately, rarely spoke Zaza as a mothertongue at the time) in favor of modern western in the Zaza language, and thus their interest in the most important inheritance of their ancestors.<ref name=\"elliance\"/>\n\nThere is a division between Northern and Southern Zaza, most notably in phonological inventory, but Zaza as a whole forms a dialect continuum, with no recognized standard. Northern Zaza is strongly associated with historical Dersim, and is spoken in the northern and northeastern parts of Elazig province, easter and central Sivas, southern Erzincan, western Erzurum and Bing\u00f6l, and of course, most of Tunceli (the heart of historical Dersim) <ref>[https://elalliance.org/languages/iranic/zaza/ Zaza people and Zaza Language]</ref>\n\n== Connection to Kurds ==\n[[File:Kurdes Zaza de Diarbekir (Kurdistan).jpg|250px|thumb|right|\"Zaza Kurds in [[Diyarbakir]] (Kurdistan)\", E.Chantre & C.Barry, 1881]]\nKurds and Zazas have for centuries lived in the same areas in Anatolia. In the 1920s and 1930s, Zazas played a key role in the rise of Kurdish nationalism with their rebellions against the [[Ottoman Empire]] and later the [[Republic of Turkey]].

[[Ebubekir Pamukchu]], the founder of the Zaza national movement expressed this idea in the following sentence: \"From that moment I became Zaza.\"<ref name=\"Arakelova 1999 397\u2013408\"/> E.

At the age of 20 he joined the leftists and was several times imprisoned for his political activities and seditious poems. In 1989 E.

These are not the only claims by Kurds, and others of attempts by the Turkish government to use Zaza nationalism to attack the strength of Kurdish resistance. The Zazas have the attractions of modern Turkey, and the socio-economic (especially educational) benefits it offers other neighboring minorities who eschew involvement in Kurdish separatism (such as the Lazi[c]s to the far north, or Arabic and Syriac-speaking enclaves in and around Mardin).<ref name=\"Trompf 2013 321\u2013344\"/>\n\nIn an interview with Kurdmedia, Kurdish-Zaza linguist [[Mehemed Malm\u00eesanij]] said the name of this \u201cZazaistan\u201d publisher was the \u201cZaza Culture and Publication House\u201d and was part of the Turkish intelligence services with the task of attacking the Kurdish nationalist movement. \u201cThe conclusion that I draw\u2026 is that these [Zaza nationalist groups] were groups based in the state, or with a more favorable expression, groups that thought in parallel with the state\u201d.{{r|wilgenburg}}\n\n== See also ==\n*[[Sedat Bucak]]\n*[[Kurdistan]]\n*[[Daylamites]]\n\n== References ==\n{{Reflist|25em|refs=\n<ref name=Lezgin>{{cite web |last=Lezg\u00een |first=Ro\u015fan |title=Among Social Kurdish Groups \u2013 General Glance at Zazas |website=Zazaki.net |url=http://www.zazaki.net/haber/among-social-kurdish-groups-general-glance-at-zazas-503.htm }}</ref>\n<ref name=\"Malm\u00eesanij\">{{Cite book |author=Malmisanij |year=1996 |title=Kird, Kirmanc, Dimili or Zaza Kurds |location=Istanbul |publisher=Deng Publishing |url=https://archive.org/details/Kird-Kirmanc-Dimili-Zaza-Kurtleri }}</ref>\n<ref name=Kehl-Bo99>{{cite journal |last=Kehl-Bodrogi |first=Krisztina |date=October 1999 |title=Kurds, Turks, or a People in their own Right?

For example, a [[Sanskrit]] inscription notes that Sultan [[Muhammad bin Tughluq]] repaired a Siva temple in [[Bidar]] after his [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]] conquest.

The exteriors of both were very often topped by large [[dome]]s, and made extensive use of [[arch]]es.  Both of these features were hardly used in [[Hindu temple architecture]] and other indigenous Indian styles.  Both types of building essentially consist of a single large space under a high dome, and completely avoid the figurative sculpture so important to [[Hindu temple architecture]].<ref>Harle, 421, 425; Yale, 165; Blair & Bloom, 149</ref>\n\nThe important [[Qutb Complex]] in Delhi was begun under [[Muhammad of Ghor]], by 1199, and continued under Qutb al-Din Aibak and later sultans.  The [[Qutb complex#Quwwat-ul-Islam Mosque|Quwwat-ul-Islam Mosque]], now a ruin, was the first structure.  Like other early Islamic buildings it re-used elements such as columns from destroyed Hindu and [[Jain]] temples, including one on the same site whose platform was reused.  The style was Iranian, but the arches were still [[Corbel arch|corbelled]] in the traditional Indian way.<ref>Yale, 164-165; Harle, 423-424; Blair & Bloom, 149</ref>\n\nBeside it is the extremely tall [[Qutb Minar]], a [[minaret]] or victory tower, whose original four stages reach 73 meters (with a final stage added later). Its closest comparator is the 62-metre all-brick [[Minaret of Jam]] in Afghanistan, of c.1190, a decade or so before the probable start of the Delhi tower.<ref>Also two huge minarets at [[Ghazni]].</ref>  The surfaces of both are elaborately decorated with inscriptions and geometric patterns; in Delhi the shaft is [[fluting (architecture)|fluted]] with \"superb [[stalactite]] bracketing under the balconies\" at the top of each stage.<ref>Yale, 164; Harle, 424 (quoted); Blair & Bloom, 149</ref>  In general [[minaret]]s were slow to be used in India, and are often detached from the main mosque where they exist.<ref>Harle, 429</ref>\n\nThe Tomb of [[Iltutmish]] was added by 1236; its dome, the [[squinch]]es again corbelled, is now missing, and the intricate carving has been described as having an \"angular harshness\", from carvers working in an unfamiliar tradition.<ref>Yale, 164 (quoted); Harle, 425</ref>  Other elements were added to the complex over the next two centuries.\n\nAnother very early mosque, begun in the 1190s, is the [[Adhai Din Ka Jhonpra]] in [[Ajmer]], [[Rajasthan]], built for the same Delhi rulers, again with corbelled arches and domes.  Here Hindu temple columns (and possibly some new ones) are piled up in threes to achieve extra height.  Both mosques had large detached screens with pointed corbelled arches added in front of them, probably under Iltutmish a couple of decades later.  In these the central arch is taller, in imitation of an [[iwan]]. At Ajmer the smaller screen arches are tentatively cusped, for the first time in India.<ref>Blair & Bloom, 149-150; Harle, 425</ref>\n[[File:Tomb of Ghiyasuddin Tughlaq and side tomb (3319047170).jpg|thumb|Tomb of [[Ghiyath al-Din Tughluq]] (d. 1325), Delhi]]\n\nBy around 1300 true domes and arches with [[voussoir]]s were being built; the ruined [[Tomb of Balban]] (d. 1287) in Delhi may be the earliest survival.<ref>Harle, 425</ref>  The [[Alai Darwaza]] gatehouse at the Qutb complex, from 1311, still shows a cautious approach to the new technology, with very thick walls and a shallow dome, only visible from a certain distance or height.  Bold contrasting colours of masonry, with red [[sandstone]] and white [[marble]], introduce what was to become a common feature of Indo-Islamic architecture, substituting for the polychrome tiles used in Persia and Central Asia. The pointed arches come together slightly at their base, giving a mild [[horseshoe arch]] effect, and their internal edges are not cusped but lined with conventionalized \"spearhead\" projections, possibly representing [[lotus flower|lotus]] buds. [[Jali]], stone [[openwork]] screens, are introduced here; they already had been long used in temples.<ref>Blair & Bloom, 151</ref>\n\n====Tughlaq architecture====\nThe [[tomb of Shah Rukn-e-Alam]] (built 1320 to 1324) in [[Multan]], Pakistan is a large octagonal brick-built [[mausoleum]] with polychrome glazed decoration that remains much closer to the styles of Iran and Afghanistan.  Timber is also used internally.  This was the earliest major monument of the [[Tughlaq dynasty]] (1320\u20131413), built during the unsustainable expansion of its massive territory. It was built for a [[Sufi saint]] rather than a sultan, and most of the many [[Tughlaq tombs]] are much less exuberant.  The tomb of the founder of the dynasty, [[Ghiyath al-Din Tughluq]] (d. 1325) is more austere, but impressive; like a Hindu temple, it is topped with a small [[amalaka]] and a round [[finial]] like a [[kalasha]]. Unlike the buildings mentioned previously, it completely lacks carved texts, and sits in a compound with high walls and battlements.

Soon, [[Turkic migration|Turks were migrating]] to [[Muslim lands]] and becoming [[Islamicization|Islamicized]].

For example, a [[Sanskrit]] inscription notes that Sultan [[Muhammad bin Tughluq]] repaired a Siva temple in [[Bidar]] after his [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]] conquest. There was often a pattern of Delhi sultans plundering or damaging temples during conquest, and then patronizing or repairing temples after conquest.

The exteriors of both were very often topped by large [[dome]]s, and made extensive use of [[arch]]es.  Both of these features were hardly used in [[Hindu temple architecture]] and other indigenous Indian styles.  Both types of building essentially consist of a single large space under a high dome, and completely avoid the figurative sculpture so important to [[Hindu temple architecture]].<ref>Harle, 421, 425; Yale, 165; Blair & Bloom, 149</ref>\n\nThe important [[Qutb Complex]] in Delhi was begun under [[Muhammad of Ghor]], by 1199, and continued under Qutb al-Din Aibak and later sultans.  The [[Qutb complex#Quwwat-ul-Islam Mosque|Quwwat-ul-Islam Mosque]], now a ruin, was the first structure.  Like other early Islamic buildings it re-used elements such as columns from destroyed Hindu and [[Jain]] temples, including one on the same site whose platform was reused.  The style was Iranian, but the arches were still [[Corbel arch|corbelled]] in the traditional Indian way.<ref>Yale, 164-165; Harle, 423-424; Blair & Bloom, 149</ref>\n\nBeside it is the extremely tall [[Qutb Minar]], a [[minaret]] or victory tower, whose original four stages reach 73 meters (with a final stage added later). Its closest comparator is the 62-metre all-brick [[Minaret of Jam]] in Afghanistan, of c.1190, a decade or so before the probable start of the Delhi tower.<ref>Also two huge minarets at [[Ghazni]].</ref>  The surfaces of both are elaborately decorated with inscriptions and geometric patterns; in Delhi the shaft is [[fluting (architecture)|fluted]] with \"superb [[stalactite]] bracketing under the balconies\" at the top of each stage.<ref>Yale, 164; Harle, 424 (quoted); Blair & Bloom, 149</ref>  In general [[minaret]]s were slow to be used in India, and are often detached from the main mosque where they exist.<ref>Harle, 429</ref>\n\nThe Tomb of [[Iltutmish]] was added by 1236; its dome, the [[squinch]]es again corbelled, is now missing, and the intricate carving has been described as having an \"angular harshness\", from carvers working in an unfamiliar tradition.<ref>Yale, 164 (quoted); Harle, 425</ref>  Other elements were added to the complex over the next two centuries.\n\nAnother very early mosque, begun in the 1190s, is the [[Adhai Din Ka Jhonpra]] in [[Ajmer]], [[Rajasthan]], built for the same Delhi rulers, again with corbelled arches and domes.  Here Hindu temple columns (and possibly some new ones) are piled up in threes to achieve extra height.  Both mosques had large detached screens with pointed corbelled arches added in front of them, probably under Iltutmish a couple of decades later.  In these the central arch is taller, in imitation of an [[iwan]]. At Ajmer the smaller screen arches are tentatively cusped, for the first time in India.<ref>Blair & Bloom, 149-150; Harle, 425</ref>\n[[File:Tomb of Ghiyasuddin Tughlaq and side tomb (3319047170).jpg|thumb|Tomb of [[Ghiyath al-Din Tughluq]] (d. 1325), Delhi]]\n\nBy around 1300 true domes and arches with [[voussoir]]s were being built; the ruined [[Tomb of Balban]] (d. 1287) in Delhi may be the earliest survival.<ref>Harle, 425</ref>  The [[Alai Darwaza]] gatehouse at the Qutb complex, from 1311, still shows a cautious approach to the new technology, with very thick walls and a shallow dome, only visible from a certain distance or height.  Bold contrasting colours of masonry, with red [[sandstone]] and white [[marble]], introduce what was to become a common feature of Indo-Islamic architecture, substituting for the polychrome tiles used in Persia and Central Asia. The pointed arches come together slightly at their base, giving a mild [[horseshoe arch]] effect, and their internal edges are not cusped but lined with conventionalized \"spearhead\" projections, possibly representing [[lotus flower|lotus]] buds. [[Jali]], stone [[openwork]] screens, are introduced here; they already had been long used in temples.<ref>Blair & Bloom, 151</ref>\n\n====Tughlaq architecture====\nThe [[tomb of Shah Rukn-e-Alam]] (built 1320 to 1324) in [[Multan]], Pakistan is a large octagonal brick-built [[mausoleum]] with polychrome glazed decoration that remains much closer to the styles of Iran and Afghanistan.  Timber is also used internally.  This was the earliest major monument of the [[Tughlaq dynasty]] (1320\u20131413), built during the unsustainable expansion of its massive territory. It was built for a [[Sufi saint]] rather than a sultan, and most of the many [[Tughlaq tombs]] are much less exuberant.  The tomb of the founder of the dynasty, [[Ghiyath al-Din Tughluq]] (d. 1325) is more austere, but impressive; like a Hindu temple, it is topped with a small [[amalaka]] and a round [[finial]] like a [[kalasha]]. Unlike the buildings mentioned previously, it completely lacks carved texts, and sits in a compound with high walls and battlements.  Both these tombs have external walls sloping slightly inwards, by 25\u00b0 in the Delhi tomb, like many fortifications including the ruined [[Tughlaqabad Fort]] opposite the tomb, intended as the new capital.<ref>Blair & Bloom, 151-156; Harle, 425-426</ref>\n\nThe Tughlaqs had a corps of government architects and builders, and in this and other roles employed many Hindus.  They left many buildings, and a standardized dynastic style.<ref>Blair & Bloom, 151</ref> The third sultan, [[Firuz Shah Tughluq|Firuz Shah]] (r. 1351-88) is said to have designed buildings himself, and was the longest ruler and greatest builder of the dynasty.
