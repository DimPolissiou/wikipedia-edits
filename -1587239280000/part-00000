Linguists include the [[Rotuman language]] in a subgroup with the languages of western Fiji, but Rotuman also has a large number of Polynesian loanwords, indicating later contact with [[Samoa]] and [[Tonga]].\n\n===Origins in oral history===\nRotuman [[oral history]] indicates that the islands' first inhabitants came from Samoa, whence they were led by a man named Raho. Shortly thereafter, further settlers arrived from Tonga. Later, additional settlers came from Tonga and [[Kiribati]]. In the 1850s and 1860s, Tongan Prince [[Enele Ma\u02bbafu|Ma'afu]] claimed Rotuma and sent subordinates to administer the main island and islets.<ref>[http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-TuvAcco-t1-body1-d53.html \"The Rotuman People\"], p.&nbsp;4, in Te'o Tuvale, ''An Account of Samoan History up to 1918''</ref>\n\nRatzel<ref>[http://www.inquirewithin.biz/history/american_pacific/oceania/legends.htm The History of Mankind] by Professor Friedrich Ratzel, Book II, Section A, The Races of Oceania page 173, MacMillan and Co., Ltd., published 1896</ref> wrote about a legend relating to the Samoans and Rotuma as follows:\n\n<blockquote>\"Thus the Samoans relate that one of their chiefs fished up Rotuma and planted coco-palm on it. But in a later migration the chief Tokaniua came that way with a canoe full of men and quarrelled with him about the prior right of possession.\"</blockquote>\n\n===European contact===\nThe first known [[Europe]]an sighting of Rotuma was in 1791, when [[Captain (naval)|Captain]] [[Edward Edwards (Royal Navy officer)|Edward Edwards]] and the crew of [[HMS Pandora (1779)|HMS ''Pandora'']] landed in search of sailors who had disappeared following the [[Mutiny on the Bounty]]. There has been some argument whether the island discovered by [[Pedro Fernandes de Queir\u00f3s|Quir\u00f3s]] known as ''Tuamaco'' fits the description and location of Rotuma, but no claim has been fully substantiated.\n\n===Mid-19th century===\nA favorite of whaling ships in need of reprovisioning, in the mid-nineteenth century Rotuma became a haven for runaway sailors, some of whom were escaped convicts. Some of these deserters married local women and contributed their genes to an already heterogeneous pool; others met violent ends, reportedly at one another's hands. The first recorded whaler to visit was the ''Loper'' in 1825. The last known whaling visit was by the ''[[Charles W. Morgan (ship)|Charles W. Morgan]]'' in 1894.<ref>Langdon, Robert (1984), ''Where the whalers went: an index to the Pacific ports and islands visited by American whalers (and some other ships) in the 19th century'', Canberra, Pacific Manuscripts Bureau, p.209. {{ISBN|086784471X}}</ref> Rotuma was visited as part of the [[United States Exploring Expedition]] in 1840.\n\n===Cession to Britain===\n[[Methodism|Wesleyan]] teachers from [[Tonga]] arrived on Rotuma in June 1841, followed by [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[Society of Mary (Marists)|Marists]] in 1847. The Roman Catholic missionaries withdrew in 1853 but returned in 1868. Conflicts between the two groups, fuelled by previous political rivalries among the chiefs of Rotuma's seven districts, resulted in hostilities that led the local chiefs in 1879 to ask [[United Kingdom|Britain]] to annex the island group. On 13 May 1881, Rotuma was officially ceded to the [[United Kingdom]], seven years after Fiji became a colony. The event is annually celebrated as [[Rotuma Day]].\n\n== Demographics ==\nAlthough the island has been politically part of Fiji since 1881, Rotuman culture more closely resembles that of the [[Polynesia]]n islands to the east, most noticeably [[Tonga]], [[Samoa]], [[Futuna (Wallis and Futuna)|Futuna]], and [[Wallis (island)|Uvea]]. Because of their Polynesian appearance and distinctive [[Rotuman language|language]], Rotumans now constitute a recognizable minority group within the Republic of Fiji. The great majority of Rotumans (9,984 according to the 2007 Fiji census) now live elsewhere in Fiji, with 1,953&nbsp;Rotumans remaining on Rotuma. [[Rotumans]] are culturally conservative and maintain their customs in the face of changes brought about by increased contact with the outside world.  As recently as 1985, some 85 percent of Rotumans voted against opening the island up to [[tourism]], wary of the influence of Western tourists.

The Paramount chief was granted the name of Albert by the Queen in honour of her husband Prince Albert who had died twenty years earlier.\n\nFollowing Fiji's independence in 1970 and the military coups of 1987, Rotuma remained with Fiji.\n\n===Social organization===\nRotuma is divided into seven autonomous districts, each with its own headman or chief ([[gagaja|Gagaj 'es Itu'u]]), with villages:\n#[[Noa'tau]] (extreme southeast): Fekeioko, Maragte'u, Faf'iasina, Matu'ea, 'Ut'utu, Kalvaka\n#[[Oinafa]] (east): Oinafa, Lopta, Paptea\n#[[Itu'ti'u]] (west, but east of western peninsula): Savlei, L\u1ea1u, Feav\u1ea1i, Tu\u1ea1'koi, Motusa, Hapmak, Losa, Fapufa, Ah\u1ea1u (Government Station)\n#[[Malha'a]] (north): Pepheua, 'Else'e, 'Elsio\n#[[Juju (district)|Juju]] (south): Tu\u1ea1i, Haga, Juju\n#[[Pepjei]] (southeast): 'Ujia, U\u1ea1nheta, Avave\n#[[Itu'muta]] (western peninsula): Maftoa, Lopo\n\nThe district chiefs and elected district representatives make up the [[Council of Rotuma|Rotuma Island Council]] . The districts are divided into subgroupings of households (ho'aga) that function as work groups under the leadership of a subchief (gagaj 'es ho'aga). All district headmen and the majority of ho'aga headmen are titled. In addition, some men hold titles without headship (as t\u00f6g), although they are expected to exercise leadership roles in support of the district headman. Titles, which are held for life, belong to specified house sites (fu\u1ea1g ri). All the descendants of previous occupants of a fu\u1ea1g ri have a right to participate in the selection of successors to titles.\n\nOn formal occasions titled men and dignitaries such as ministers and priests, government officials, and distinguished visitors occupy a place of honor. They are ceremonially served food from special baskets and kava. In the daily routine of Village life, however, they are not especially privileged. As yet no significant class distinctions based on wealth or control of resources have emerged, but investments in elaborate housing and motor vehicles by a few families have led to visible differences in standard of living.\n\n===Political organization===\nAt the time of arrival by Europeans there were three pan-Rotuman political positions: the [[fakpure]], the [[s\u1ea1u (Rotuman king)|s\u1ea1u]], and the mua. The fakpure acted as convener and presiding officer over the council of district headmen and was responsible for appointing the s\u1ea1u and ensuring that he was cared for properly. The fakpure was headman of the District that headed the alliance that had won the last war. The s\u1ea1u's role was to take part in the ritual cycle, oriented toward ensuring prosperity, as an object of veneration. Early European visitors referred to the s\u1ea1u as \"king,\" but he actually had no secular power. The position of s\u1ea1u was supposed to rotate between districts, and a breach of this custom was considered to be incitement to war. The role of mua is more obscure, but like the s\u1ea1u, he was an active participant in the ritual cycle. According to some accounts the mua acted as a kind of high priest.\n\nFollowing Christianization in the 1860s, the offices of s\u1ea1u and mua were terminated. Colonial administration involved the appointment by the governor of Fiji of a Resident Commissioner (after 1935, a [[District Officer]]) to Rotuma. He was advised by a council composed of the district chiefs. In 1940 the council was expanded to include an elected representative from each district and the Assistant Medical Practitioner. Following Fiji's independence in 1970, the council assumed responsibility for the internal governance of Rotuma, with the District Officer assigned to an advisory role. Up until the first coup, Rotuma was represented in the Fiji legislature by a single senator.\n\nAdministratively, Rotuma is fully incorporated into Fiji, but with [[Local government in Fiji|local government]] so tailored as to give the island a measure of autonomy greater than that enjoyed by other political subdivisions of Fiji.  Rotuma has the status of a '''Dependency,''' and its administrative [[Capital (political)|capital]] is [['A\u1e25au (Fiji)|'Ah\u1ea1u]] in the district of Itu'ti'u, where the \"tari\u1ea1gs\u1ea1u\" (traditionally the name of the s\u1ea1u's palace) meeting house for the Council of Rotuma is based.\n\nAt the national level, Fijian citizens of Rotuman descent elect one representative to the Fijian [[House of Representatives of Fiji|House of Representatives]], and the Council of Rotuma nominates one representative to the [[Senate of Fiji|Fijian Senate]].  Rotuma is also represented in the influential [[Great Council of Chiefs]] by three representatives chosen by the Council of Rotuma. For electoral purposes, Rotumans were formerly classified as [[Fijians]], but when the [[1997 Constitution of Fiji|Constitution]] was revised in 1997\u20131998, they were granted separate representation at their own request. (The majority of seats in Fiji's House of Representatives are allocated on a [[Communal constituencies|communal basis]] to Fiji's various [[Demographics of Fiji|ethnic groups]])  In addition, Rotuma forms part (along with [[Taveuni]] and the [[Lau Islands]]) of the [[Lau Taveuni Rotuma (Open Constituency, Fiji)|Lau Taveuni Rotuma]] [[Open constituencies|Open Constituency]], one of 25&nbsp;constituencies whose representatives are chosen by [[universal suffrage]].\n\n===Social control===\nThe ''ho'aga'', a kinship community, was the basic residential unit in pre-contact Rotuma.<ref name=\"HOW1\">{{cite journal|last1= Howard |first1= Alan |url= http://www.rotuma.net/os/howsel/5landchange.html |title= Land Tenure and Social Change in Rotuma |year= 1964 |volume=73 |issue=|journal= Journal of the Polynesian Society |pages=26\u201352 }}</ref> The basis for social control is a strong socialization emphasis on social responsibility and a sensitivity to shaming. Gossip serves as a mechanism for sanctioning deviation, but the most powerful deterrent to antisocial behavior is an abiding belief in imminent justice, that supernatural forces (the 'atua or ghosts of ancestors) will punish wrongdoing. Rotumans are a rather gentle people; violence is extremely rare and serious crimes nearly nonexistent.\n\n===Conflict===\nPrior to cession, warfare, though conducted on a modest scale, was endemic in Rotuma. During the colonial era political rivalries were muted, since power was concentrated in the offices of Resident Commissioner and District Officer. Following Fiji's independence, however, interdistrict rivalries were again given expression, now in the form of political contention. Following the second coup, when Fiji left the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], a segment of the Rotuman population, known as the \"M\u00f6lmahao Clan\" of [[Noa\u2019tau]] rejected the council's decision to remain with the newly declared republic. Arguing that Rotuma had been ceded to the United Kingdom and not to Fiji, these rebels declared in 1987 independence of [[Republic of Rotuma]] and were charged with sedition. It did not have any substantive support, majority opinion appears to favor remaining with Fiji, but rumblings of discontent remain.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of volcanoes in Fiji]]\n*[[Rotuma Airport]]\n\n==References==\n*[http://islands.unep.ch/ILQ.htm Islands of Fiji], Island Directory, United Nations Environment Programme\n{{reflist}}\n*A.M.

Linguists include the [[Rotuman language]] in a subgroup with the languages of western Fiji, but Rotuman also has a large number of Polynesian loanwords, indicating later contact with [[Samoa]] and [[Tonga]].\n\n===Origins in oral history===\nRotuman [[oral history]] indicates that the islands' first inhabitants came from Samoa, whence they were led by a man named Raho. Shortly thereafter, further settlers arrived from Tonga. Later, additional settlers came from Tonga and [[Kiribati]]. In the 1850s and 1860s, Tongan Prince [[Enele Ma\u02bbafu|Ma'afu]] claimed Rotuma and sent subordinates to administer the main island and islets.<ref>[http://www.nzetc.org/tm/scholarly/tei-TuvAcco-t1-body1-d53.html \"The Rotuman People\"], p.&nbsp;4, in Te'o Tuvale, ''An Account of Samoan History up to 1918''</ref>\n\nRatzel<ref>[http://www.inquirewithin.biz/history/american_pacific/oceania/legends.htm The History of Mankind] by Professor Friedrich Ratzel, Book II, Section A, The Races of Oceania page 173, MacMillan and Co., Ltd., published 1896</ref> wrote about a legend relating to the Samoans and Rotuma as follows:\n\n<blockquote>\"Thus the Samoans relate that one of their chiefs fished up Rotuma and planted coco-palm on it. But in a later migration the chief Tokaniua came that way with a canoe full of men and quarrelled with him about the prior right of possession.\"</blockquote>\n\n===European contact===\nThe first known [[Europe]]an sighting of Rotuma was in 1791, when [[Captain (naval)|Captain]] [[Edward Edwards (Royal Navy officer)|Edward Edwards]] and the crew of [[HMS Pandora (1779)|HMS ''Pandora'']] landed in search of sailors who had disappeared following the [[Mutiny on the Bounty]]. There has been some argument whether the island discovered by [[Pedro Fernandes de Queir\u00f3s|Quir\u00f3s]] known as ''Tuamaco'' fits the description and location of Rotuma, but no claim has been fully substantiated.\n\n===Mid-19th century===\nA favorite of whaling ships in need of reprovisioning, in the mid-nineteenth century Rotuma became a haven for runaway sailors, some of whom were escaped convicts. Some of these deserters married local women and contributed their genes to an already heterogeneous pool; others met violent ends, reportedly at one another's hands. The first recorded whaler to visit was the ''Loper'' in 1825. The last known whaling visit was by the ''[[Charles W. Morgan (ship)|Charles W. Morgan]]'' in 1894.<ref>Langdon, Robert (1984), ''Where the whalers went: an index to the Pacific ports and islands visited by American whalers (and some other ships) in the 19th century'', Canberra, Pacific Manuscripts Bureau, p.209. {{ISBN|086784471X}}</ref> Rotuma was visited as part of the [[United States Exploring Expedition]] in 1840.\n\n===Cession to Britain===\n[[Methodism|Wesleyan]] teachers from [[Tonga]] arrived on Rotuma in June 1841, followed by [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[Society of Mary (Marists)|Marists]] in 1847. The Roman Catholic missionaries withdrew in 1853 but returned in 1868. Conflicts between the two groups, fuelled by previous political rivalries among the chiefs of Rotuma's seven districts, resulted in hostilities that led the local chiefs in 1879 to ask [[United Kingdom|Britain]] to annex the island group. On 13 May 1881, Rotuma was officially ceded to the [[United Kingdom]], seven years after Fiji became a colony. The event is annually celebrated as [[Rotuma Day]].\n\n== Demographics ==\nAlthough the island has been politically part of Fiji since 1881, Rotuman culture more closely resembles that of the [[Polynesia]]n islands to the east, most noticeably [[Tonga]], [[Samoa]], [[Futuna (Wallis and Futuna)|Futuna]], and [[Wallis (island)|Uvea]]. Because of their Polynesian appearance and distinctive [[Rotuman language|language]], Rotumans now constitute a recognizable minority group within the Republic of Fiji. The great majority of Rotumans (9,984 according to the 2007 Fiji census) now live elsewhere in Fiji, with 1,953&nbsp;Rotumans remaining on Rotuma. [[Rotumans]] are culturally conservative and maintain their customs in the face of changes brought about by increased contact with the outside world.  As recently as 1985, some 85 percent of Rotumans voted against opening the island up to [[tourism]], wary of the influence of Western tourists. P&O Cruises landed on the island twice in the 1980s.\n\n==Notable Rotumans and people of Rotuman descent==\nRiamkau Sau, Last King of Rotuma\n\nTomoniko Vaurasi, Veterinary\n\n*[[Colonel]] [[Paul Manueli]] a former Commander of the Royal Fiji Military Forces, Fiji Cabinet minister, Senator and successful businessman\n*[[Jioji Konrote]], President of Fiji since 2015 and former [[High Commissioner]] to Australia\n*Former Information Minister [[Marieta Rigamoto]]\n*[[Chief Justice of Fiji|Chief Justice]] [[Daniel Fatiaki]]\n*Irish sportsmen brothers [[Se\u00e1n \u00d3g \u00d3 hAilp\u00edn|Se\u00e1n \u00d3g]] and [[Setanta \u00d3 hAilp\u00edn]]\n*[[National Rugby League|NRL]] player [[John Sutton (rugby league)|John Sutton]]\n*[[Vilsoni Hereniko]], playwright and film director\n*[[Sapeta Taito]], actress (''[[The Land Has Eyes]]'')\n*[[Jono Gibbes]] (maternal side), a New Zealand rugby union player\n*[[Rocky Khan]], (maternal side) New Zealand rugby union player<ref>{{cite news|last=Robson|first=Toby|title=Rocky Khan a sevens player with a difference|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/sport/rugby/sevens/8238004/Rocky-Khan-a-sevens-player-with-a-difference|accessdate=4 November 2013|newspaper=[[Fairfax Media]]|date=30 January 2011}}</ref>\n*[[Graham Dewes]], a Fiji rugby union player\n*[[Daniel Rae Costello]], a Fijian-born musician of Rotuman descent\n*[[Rebecca Tavo]], Australian Touch Rugby Player with Rotuman father<ref>http://www.rotuma.net/os/sports/sports2009/sports0901.htm</ref>\n*[[Selina Hornibrook]], Former Australian Netball Player with Rotuman mother\n*[[Ngaire Fuata]], New Zealand Television producer and singer with Rotuman father<ref>http://tvnz.co.nz/view/tvone_minisite_story_skin/415110</ref>\n* [[Pene Erenio]], top Fiji soccer player (Savusavu)\n* [[Ravai Fatiaki]] Fiji Rugby Union Player\n*[[Sofia Tekela-Smith]], New Zealand artist raised on Rotuma by her grandmother\n*[[David Eggleton]], Poet Laureate of New Zealand, of Rotuman descent on his maternal side\n* [[Fred Fatiaki]], coach\n\n== Politics and society ==\n{{main|Local government of Fiji}}\nRotuma was governed as an integral part of the Colony of Fiji after cession to the [[United Kingdom]] in 1881 when a group of Rotuman chiefs travelled to London to meet Queen Victoria. The Paramount chief was granted the name of Albert by the Queen in honour of her husband Prince Albert who had died twenty years earlier.\n\nFollowing Fiji's independence in 1970 and the military coups of 1987, Rotuma remained with Fiji.\n\n===Social organization===\nRotuma is divided into seven autonomous districts, each with its own headman or chief ([[gagaja|Gagaj 'es Itu'u]]), with villages:\n#[[Noa'tau]] (extreme southeast): Fekeioko, Maragte'u, Faf'iasina, Matu'ea, 'Ut'utu, Kalvaka\n#[[Oinafa]] (east): Oinafa, Lopta, Paptea\n#[[Itu'ti'u]] (west, but east of western peninsula): Savlei, L\u1ea1u, Feav\u1ea1i, Tu\u1ea1'koi, Motusa, Hapmak, Losa, Fapufa, Ah\u1ea1u (Government Station)\n#[[Malha'a]] (north): Pepheua, 'Else'e, 'Elsio\n#[[Juju (district)|Juju]] (south): Tu\u1ea1i, Haga, Juju\n#[[Pepjei]] (southeast): 'Ujia, U\u1ea1nheta, Avave\n#[[Itu'muta]] (western peninsula): Maftoa, Lopo\n\nThe district chiefs and elected district representatives make up the [[Council of Rotuma|Rotuma Island Council]] . The districts are divided into subgroupings of households (ho'aga) that function as work groups under the leadership of a subchief (gagaj 'es ho'aga). All district headmen and the majority of ho'aga headmen are titled. In addition, some men hold titles without headship (as t\u00f6g), although they are expected to exercise leadership roles in support of the district headman. Titles, which are held for life, belong to specified house sites (fu\u1ea1g ri). All the descendants of previous occupants of a fu\u1ea1g ri have a right to participate in the selection of successors to titles.\n\nOn formal occasions titled men and dignitaries such as ministers and priests, government officials, and distinguished visitors occupy a place of honor. They are ceremonially served food from special baskets and kava. In the daily routine of Village life, however, they are not especially privileged. As yet no significant class distinctions based on wealth or control of resources have emerged, but investments in elaborate housing and motor vehicles by a few families have led to visible differences in standard of living.\n\n===Political organization===\nAt the time of arrival by Europeans there were three pan-Rotuman political positions: the [[fakpure]], the [[s\u1ea1u (Rotuman king)|s\u1ea1u]], and the mua. The fakpure acted as convener and presiding officer over the council of district headmen and was responsible for appointing the s\u1ea1u and ensuring that he was cared for properly. The fakpure was headman of the District that headed the alliance that had won the last war. The s\u1ea1u's role was to take part in the ritual cycle, oriented toward ensuring prosperity, as an object of veneration. Early European visitors referred to the s\u1ea1u as \"king,\" but he actually had no secular power. The position of s\u1ea1u was supposed to rotate between districts, and a breach of this custom was considered to be incitement to war. The role of mua is more obscure, but like the s\u1ea1u, he was an active participant in the ritual cycle. According to some accounts the mua acted as a kind of high priest.\n\nFollowing Christianization in the 1860s, the offices of s\u1ea1u and mua were terminated. Colonial administration involved the appointment by the governor of Fiji of a Resident Commissioner (after 1935, a [[District Officer]]) to Rotuma. He was advised by a council composed of the district chiefs. In 1940 the council was expanded to include an elected representative from each district and the Assistant Medical Practitioner. Following Fiji's independence in 1970, the council assumed responsibility for the internal governance of Rotuma, with the District Officer assigned to an advisory role. Up until the first coup, Rotuma was represented in the Fiji legislature by a single senator.\n\nAdministratively, Rotuma is fully incorporated into Fiji, but with [[Local government in Fiji|local government]] so tailored as to give the island a measure of autonomy greater than that enjoyed by other political subdivisions of Fiji.  Rotuma has the status of a '''Dependency,''' and its administrative [[Capital (political)|capital]] is [['A\u1e25au (Fiji)|'Ah\u1ea1u]] in the district of Itu'ti'u, where the \"tari\u1ea1gs\u1ea1u\" (traditionally the name of the s\u1ea1u's palace) meeting house for the Council of Rotuma is based.\n\nAt the national level, Fijian citizens of Rotuman descent elect one representative to the Fijian [[House of Representatives of Fiji|House of Representatives]], and the Council of Rotuma nominates one representative to the [[Senate of Fiji|Fijian Senate]].  Rotuma is also represented in the influential [[Great Council of Chiefs]] by three representatives chosen by the Council of Rotuma. For electoral purposes, Rotumans were formerly classified as [[Fijians]], but when the [[1997 Constitution of Fiji|Constitution]] was revised in 1997\u20131998, they were granted separate representation at their own request. (The majority of seats in Fiji's House of Representatives are allocated on a [[Communal constituencies|communal basis]] to Fiji's various [[Demographics of Fiji|ethnic groups]])  In addition, Rotuma forms part (along with [[Taveuni]] and the [[Lau Islands]]) of the [[Lau Taveuni Rotuma (Open Constituency, Fiji)|Lau Taveuni Rotuma]] [[Open constituencies|Open Constituency]], one of 25&nbsp;constituencies whose representatives are chosen by [[universal suffrage]].\n\n===Social control===\nThe ''ho'aga'', a kinship community, was the basic residential unit in pre-contact Rotuma.<ref name=\"HOW1\">{{cite journal|last1= Howard |first1= Alan |url= http://www.rotuma.net/os/howsel/5landchange.html |title= Land Tenure and Social Change in Rotuma |year= 1964 |volume=73 |issue=|journal= Journal of the Polynesian Society |pages=26\u201352 }}</ref> The basis for social control is a strong socialization emphasis on social responsibility and a sensitivity to shaming. Gossip serves as a mechanism for sanctioning deviation, but the most powerful deterrent to antisocial behavior is an abiding belief in imminent justice, that supernatural forces (the 'atua or ghosts of ancestors) will punish wrongdoing. Rotumans are a rather gentle people; violence is extremely rare and serious crimes nearly nonexistent.\n\n===Conflict===\nPrior to cession, warfare, though conducted on a modest scale, was endemic in Rotuma. During the colonial era political rivalries were muted, since power was concentrated in the offices of Resident Commissioner and District Officer. Following Fiji's independence, however, interdistrict rivalries were again given expression, now in the form of political contention. Following the second coup, when Fiji left the [[Commonwealth of Nations]], a segment of the Rotuman population, known as the \"M\u00f6lmahao Clan\" of [[Noa\u2019tau]] rejected the council's decision to remain with the newly declared republic. Arguing that Rotuma had been ceded to the United Kingdom and not to Fiji, these rebels declared in 1987 independence of [[Republic of Rotuma]] and were charged with sedition. It did not have any substantive support, majority opinion appears to favor remaining with Fiji, but rumblings of discontent remain.\n\n==See also==\n*[[List of volcanoes in Fiji]]\n*[[Rotuma Airport]]\n\n==References==\n*[http://islands.unep.ch/ILQ.htm Islands of Fiji], Island Directory, United Nations Environment Programme\n{{reflist}}\n*A.M.

Today it is a major part of the [[Ronald Reagan Ballistic Missile Defense Test Site]], hosting several [[radar]] systems used for tracking and characterizing missile [[reentry vehicle]]s (RV) and their [[penetration aids]] (penaids).\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name of the new island after the formerly separate islands Roi and Namur were joined by landfill. ''Roi'' is originally from [[Marshallese language|Marshallese]] ''Ruot'', while ''Namur'' is originally from Marshallese ''Nim\u0327ur''.\n\n==History==\nGermany annexed the Marshalls in 1885 but did not put government officials on the islands until 1906, leaving island affairs to a group of powerful German trading companies. Under the [[Treaty of Versailles]], Japan took over after [[World War I]]. They colonised the Marshalls extensively, developing and fortifying large bases on many of the islands.\n\nRoi-Namur was the target of the [[U.S. 4th Marine Division]] in the [[Battle of Kwajalein]], in February 1944. During the Japanese occupation, the two islands (Roi to the west ([[Marshallese language|Marshallese]]: {{lang|mh|Ruot}}, {{IPAc-mh|rwiwet}}) and Namur to the east ({{lang|mh|Nim\u0327ur}}, {{IPAc-mh|nimhirw}})) were connected by a narrow neck of land and causeway. After the American occupation, US Navy [[SeaBee]]s filled the area between the islands by December 1944; the two now joined islands are presently called Roi-Namur with a total area of about one square mile.\n\nRoi-Namur was selected by [[DARPA]] as a host site for a series of radar experiments under the [[Project Defender]] umbrella, and Project PRESS in particular. These experiments intended to use radar means to distinguish an enemy RV from its penaids though the examination of the size, shape and velocity of the objects, as well as examining the wake they left in the upper atmosphere. By building on Roi-Namur, they were able to use the test shots being used by the [[US Army]]'s [[Nike-X]] program installed on [[Kwajalein Island]] and [[Meck Island]] further to the south.\n\nThe island was flooded in March 2014 by a \"massive wave\" which swamped coastal roads.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/news/2018/04/marshall-islands-climate-change-floods-waves-environment-science-spd/|title=Within Decades, Floods May Render Many Islands Uninhabitable|last=Greshko|first=Michael|date=2018-04-25|website=National Geographic News|access-date=2019-08-25}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.usgs.gov/media/images/wave-driven-flooding-and-overwash-roi-namur-atoll-0|title=Wave-driven flooding and overwash on Roi-Namur Atoll|date=March 2014|website=www.usgs.gov|access-date=2019-08-25}}</ref>\n\n==Today==\nRoi-Namur is home to an about 120 American and Marshallese employees of the [[Reagan Test Site]].\n\nThe Roi side is the main housing area, with the retail and recreation facilities there. Activities on Roi-Namur range from a nine-hole [[golf course]], saltwater swimming pool, scuba club, movie theater, volleyball, and basketball court. Roi hosts the [[Freeflight International Airport (Marshall Islands)]] with one runway for small planes that commute from Kwajalein bringing additional workers. Additional Marshallese daytime workers come via ferry from the island of [[Enniburr]].\n\nThe Namur side is home to the ALCOR, ALTAIR, MMW and TRADEX radar tracking stations.\n\nThere is a small launch facility on Roi-Namur.

Today it is a major part of the [[Ronald Reagan Ballistic Missile Defense Test Site]], hosting several [[radar]] systems used for tracking and characterizing missile [[reentry vehicle]]s (RV) and their [[penetration aids]] (penaids).\n\n==Etymology==\nThe name of the new island after the formerly separate islands Roi and Namur were joined by landfill. ''Roi'' is originally from [[Marshallese language|Marshallese]] ''Ruot'', while ''Namur'' is originally from Marshallese ''Nim\u0327ur''.\n\n==History==\nGermany annexed the Marshalls in 1885 but did not put government officials on the islands until 1906, leaving island affairs to a group of powerful German trading companies. Under the [[Treaty of Versailles]], Japan took over after [[World War I]]. They colonised the Marshalls extensively, developing and fortifying large bases on many of the islands.\n\nRoi-Namur was the target of the [[U.S. 4th Marine Division]] in the [[Battle of Kwajalein]], in February 1944. During the Japanese occupation, the two islands (Roi to the west ([[Marshallese language|Marshallese]]: {{lang|mh|Ruot}}, {{IPAc-mh|rwiwet}}) and Namur to the east ({{lang|mh|Nim\u0327ur}}, {{IPAc-mh|nimhirw}})) were connected by a narrow neck of land and causeway. After the American occupation, US Navy [[SeaBee]]s filled the area between the islands by December 1944; the two now joined islands are presently called Roi-Namur with a total area of about one square mile.\n\nRoi-Namur was selected by [[DARPA]] as a host site for a series of radar experiments under the [[Project Defender]] umbrella, and Project PRESS in particular. These experiments intended to use radar means to distinguish an enemy RV from its penaids though the examination of the size, shape and velocity of the objects, as well as examining the wake they left in the upper atmosphere. By building on Roi-Namur, they were able to use the test shots being used by the [[US Army]]'s [[Nike-X]] program installed on [[Kwajalein Island]] and [[Meck Island]] further to the south.\n\nThe island was flooded in March 2014 by a \"massive wave\" which swamped coastal roads.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nationalgeographic.com/news/2018/04/marshall-islands-climate-change-floods-waves-environment-science-spd/|title=Within Decades, Floods May Render Many Islands Uninhabitable|last=Greshko|first=Michael|date=2018-04-25|website=National Geographic News|access-date=2019-08-25}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.usgs.gov/media/images/wave-driven-flooding-and-overwash-roi-namur-atoll-0|title=Wave-driven flooding and overwash on Roi-Namur Atoll|date=March 2014|website=www.usgs.gov|access-date=2019-08-25}}</ref>\n\n==Today==\nRoi-Namur is home to an about 120 American and Marshallese employees of the [[Reagan Test Site]].\n\nThe Roi side is the main housing area, with the retail and recreation facilities there. Activities on Roi-Namur range from a nine-hole [[golf course]], saltwater swimming pool, scuba club, movie theater, volleyball, and basketball court. Roi hosts the [[Freeflight International Airport (Marshall Islands)]] with one runway for small planes that commute from Kwajalein bringing additional workers. Additional Marshallese daytime workers come via ferry from the island of [[Enniburr]].\n\nThe Namur side is home to the ALCOR, ALTAIR, MMW and TRADEX radar tracking stations.\n\nThere is a small launch facility on Roi-Namur. Rockets launched here are usually sounding rockets that ascend beyond the atmosphere but have short ranges. There are crumbling remnants of Japanese blockhouses and pillboxes around Roi-Namur.\n\n<gallery mode=\"packed\">\nFile:Wyspy Roi-Namur - mapa.PNG|Map of Roi-Namur during World War II.
