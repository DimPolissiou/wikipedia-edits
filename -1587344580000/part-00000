Words that refer to similar concepts and processes include [[deliberation]], [[cognition]], [[idea]]tion, [[discourse]] and [[imagination]].\n\nThinking is sometimes described as a \"higher\" [[cognitive]] function and the analysis of thinking processes is a part of [[cognitive psychology]]. It is also deeply connected with our capacity to make and use [[tools]]; to understand [[causality|cause and effect]]; to recognize patterns of significance; to comprehend and [[world disclosure|disclose]] unique contexts of experience or activity; and to respond to the world in a meaningful way.\n\n[[Memory]] is the ability to preserve, retain, and subsequently recall, knowledge, information or experience. Although memory has traditionally been a persistent theme in [[philosophy]], the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries also saw the study of memory emerge as a subject of inquiry within the paradigms of [[cognitive psychology]]. In recent decades, it has become one of the pillars of a new branch of science called [[cognitive neuroscience]], a marriage between [[cognitive psychology]] and [[neuroscience]].\n\n[[Imagination]] is the activity of generating or evoking novel situations, [[image]]s, ideas or other [[qualia]] in the mind. It is a characteristically [[Subjectivity|subjective]] ''activity'', rather than a direct or passive experience. The term is technically used in [[psychology]] for the process of reviving in the mind [[perception|percepts]] of objects formerly given in sense perception. Since this use of the term conflicts with that of ordinary [[language]], some psychologists have preferred to describe this process as \"[[wikt:Imaging|imaging]]\" or \"[[wikt:Imagery|imagery]]\" or to speak of it as \"reproductive\" as opposed to \"productive\" or \"constructive\" imagination. Things imagined are said to be seen in the \"[[mind's eye]]\". Among the many practical functions of imagination are the ability to project possible futures (or histories), to \"see\" things from another's perspective, and to change the way something is perceived, including to make decisions to respond to, or enact, what is imagined.\n\n[[Consciousness]] in [[Mammal|mammals]] (this includes humans) is an aspect of the mind generally thought to comprise qualities such as [[subjectivity]], [[sentience]], and the ability to [[perception|perceive]] the relationship between [[Personal identity|oneself]] and one's [[environment (biophysical)|environment]]. It is a subject of much research in [[philosophy of mind]], [[psychology]], [[neuroscience]], and [[cognitive science]]. Some philosophers divide [[consciousness]] into [[phenomena]]l consciousness, which is subjective experience itself, and access consciousness, which refers to the global availability of information to processing systems in the brain.<ref name=\"Bl\">Ned Block: \"On a Confusion about a Function of Consciousness\" in: ''The Behavioral and Brain Sciences'', 1995.</ref> Phenomenal consciousness has many different experienced qualities, often referred to as [[qualia]]. Phenomenal consciousness is usually consciousness ''of'' something or ''about'' something, a property known as [[intentionality]] in philosophy of mind.\n\n==Mental content==\nMental contents are those items that are thought of as being \"in\" the mind, and capable of being formed and manipulated by mental processes and faculties. Examples include [[thought]]s, [[concept]]s, [[memories]], [[emotion]]s, [[percept]]s and [[intention]]s. Philosophical theories of mental content include [[internalism]], [[externalism]], [[direct and indirect realism|representationalism]] and [[intentionality]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia | url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/content-narrow/ | title=Narrow Mental Content | encyclopedia=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy | accessdate=7 September 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Memetics===\n[[Memetics]] is a theory of mental content based on an analogy with [[Darwinian evolution]], which was originated by [[Richard Dawkins]] and [[Douglas Hofstadter]] in the 1980s. It is an [[evolutionary model]] of cultural [[information transfer]]. A [[meme]], analogous to a [[gene]], is an idea, belief, pattern of behaviour (etc.) \"hosted\" in one or more individual minds, and can reproduce itself from mind to mind. Thus what would otherwise be regarded as one individual influencing another to adopt a belief, is seen memetically as a meme reproducing itself.\n\n==Relation to the brain==\n{{See also|Cognitive neuroscience}}\n\nIn animals, the [[brain]], or ''encephalon'' ([[Greek (language)|Greek]] for \"in the head\"), is the control center of the [[central nervous system]], responsible for [[thought]]. In most animals, the brain is located in the head, protected by the [[skull]] and close to the primary sensory apparatus of [[Visual perception|vision]], [[Hearing (sense)|hearing]], [[equilibrioception]], [[taste]] and [[olfaction]]. While all [[vertebrate]]s have a brain, most [[invertebrate]]s have either a centralized brain or collections of individual [[ganglion|ganglia]]. Primitive animals such as [[sponge]]s do not have a brain at all. Brains can be extremely complex.

For example, a red spot on a wall is physical in its dependence on the wall and the pigment of which it is made, but it is mental in so far as its perceived redness depends on the workings of the visual system. Unlike dual-aspect theory, neutral monism does not posit a more fundamental substance of which mind and body are aspects.\n\nThe most common monisms in the 20th and 21st centuries have all been variations of physicalism; these positions include [[behaviorism]], the [[type physicalism|type identity theory]], [[anomalous monism]] and [[functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functionalism]].<ref name=\"Kim\">Kim, J., \"Mind-Body Problem\", ''Oxford Companion to Philosophy''.

The underlying physical basis of [[learning]] and [[memory]] is likely dynamic changes in [[gene expression]] that occur in [[brain]] [[neurons]].

Epigenetic regulation of gene expression ordinarily involves chemical modification of [[DNA]] or DNA-associated [[histone]] proteins.

Historically, psychology differed from [[biology]] and [[neuroscience]] in that it was primarily concerned with mind rather than brain. Modern psychological science incorporates [[Psychophysiology|physiological]] and [[neuropsychology|neurological]] processes into its conceptions of [[perception]], [[cognition]], behaviour, and [[mental disorders]].\n\n==Mental health==\n{{Main|Mental health}}\n\nBy analogy with the health of the body, one can speak metaphorically of a state of health of the mind, or [[mental health]]. [[Merriam-Webster]] defines mental health as \"A state of emotional and psychological well-being in which an individual is able to use his or her cognitive and emotional capabilities, function in society, and meet the ordinary demands of everyday life.\" According to the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO), there is no one \"official\" definition of mental health. Cultural differences, subjective assessments, and competing professional theories all affect how \"mental health\" is defined. In general, most experts agree that \"mental health\" and \"[[mental disorder]]\" are not opposites. In other words, the absence of a recognized mental disorder is not necessarily an indicator of mental health.\n\nOne way to think about mental health is by looking at how effectively and successfully a person functions. Feeling capable and competent; being able to handle normal levels of stress, maintaining satisfying relationships, and leading an independent life; and being able to \"bounce back,\" or recover from difficult situations, are all signs of mental health.\n\n[[Psychotherapy]] is an [[interpersonal]], [[Interpersonal relationship|relational]] intervention used by trained psychotherapists to aid [[wikt:Client|clients]] in problems of living. This usually includes increasing individual sense of [[well-being]] and reducing subjective discomforting experience. Psychotherapists employ a range of techniques based on experiential relationship building, [[dialogue]], [[communication]] and [[behavior]] change and that are designed to improve the [[mental health]] of a client or patient, or to improve group relationships (such as in a [[family]]). Most forms of psychotherapy use only spoken [[conversation]], though some also use various other forms of communication such as the written word, [[art]], [[drama]], [[narrative]] story, or therapeutic touch. Psychotherapy occurs within a structured encounter between a trained [[therapist]] and client(s). Purposeful, theoretically based psychotherapy began in the 19th century with [[psychoanalysis]]; since then, scores of other approaches have been developed and continue to be created.\n\n==Non-human minds==\n\n===Animal intelligence===\n[[Animal cognition]], or cognitive ethology, is the title given to a modern approach to the mental capacities of animals. It has developed out of [[comparative psychology]], but has also been strongly influenced by the approach of [[ethology]], [[behavioral ecology]], and [[evolutionary psychology]]. Much of what used to be considered under the title of \"animal intelligence\" is now thought of under this heading.

Examples include [[control system|control]], [[Automated planning and scheduling|planning and scheduling]], the ability to answer diagnostic and consumer questions, [[handwriting recognition|handwriting]], [[natural language]], [[speech recognition|speech]] and [[facial recognition system|facial recognition]]. As such, the study of AI has also become an engineering discipline, focused on providing solutions to real life problems, [[knowledge mining]], [[software]] applications, [[strategy games]] like [[computer chess]] and other [[video game]]s. One of the biggest limitations of AI is in the domain of actual machine comprehension. Consequentially [[natural language understanding]] and [[connectionism]] (where behavior of neural networks is investigated) are areas of active research and development.\n\nThe debate about the nature of the mind is relevant to the development of [[artificial intelligence]]. If the mind is indeed a thing separate from or higher than the functioning of the brain, then hypothetically it would be much more difficult to recreate within a machine, if it were possible at all. If, on the other hand, the mind is no more than the aggregated functions of the brain, then it will be possible to create a machine with a recognisable mind (though possibly only with computers much different from today's), by simple virtue of the fact that such a machine already exists in the form of the human brain.\n\n==In religion==\nMany religions associate spiritual qualities to the human mind. These are often tightly connected to their [[mythology]] and ideas of [[afterlife]].\n\nThe [[India]]n [[philosopher]]-sage [[Sri Aurobindo]] attempted to unite the Eastern and Western psychological traditions with his [[integral psychology (Sri Aurobindo)|integral psychology]], as have many philosophers and [[New religious movement]]s. [[Judaism]] teaches that \"moach shalit al halev\", the mind rules the heart. Humans can approach the Divine intellectually, through learning and behaving according to the Divine Will as enclothed in the Torah, and use that deep logical understanding to elicit and guide emotional arousal during prayer. [[Christianity]] has tended to see the mind as distinct from the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] (Greek ''[[nous]]'') and sometimes further distinguished from the [[spirit]]. [[Esotericism|Western esoteric traditions]] sometimes refer to a [[mental body]] that exists on a plane other than the physical. [[Hinduism]]'s various philosophical schools have debated whether the human [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] (Sanskrit ''[[Atman (Hinduism)|atman]]'') is distinct from, or identical to, ''[[Brahman]]'', the [[divinity|divine]] [[reality]]. [[Taoism]] sees the human being as contiguous with natural forces, and the mind as not separate from the [[Human body|body]]. [[Confucianism]] sees the mind, like the body, as inherently perfectible.\n\n===Buddhism===\n{{See also|Buddhism and psychology|Vij\u00f1\u0101na|\u015a\u016bnyat\u0101|Shentong|Rangtong|Yogacara}}\n\nBuddhist teachings explain the moment-to-moment manifestation of the mind-stream.<ref name=\"Karunamuni2017\"/><ref name=\"Aggregates\"/> The components that make up the mind are known as the five aggregates (i.e., material form, feelings, perception, volition, and sensory consciousness), which arise and pass away continuously. The arising and passing of these aggregates in the present moment is described as being influenced by five causal laws: biological laws, psychological laws, physical laws, volitional laws, and universal laws.<ref name=\"Aggregates\"/><ref name=\"Karunamuni2017\"/> The Buddhist practice of [[mindfulness]] involves attending to this constantly changing mind-stream.\n\nAccording to [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] philosopher [[Dharmakirti]], the mind has two fundamental qualities: \"clarity and cognizes\". If something is not those two qualities, it cannot validly be called mind. \"Clarity\" refers to the fact that mind has no color, shape, size, location, weight, or any other physical characteristic, and \"cognizes\" that it functions to know or perceive objects.<ref>Gyatso, [[Geshe Kelsang Gyatso]], ''Understanding the Mind'': The Nature and Power of the Mind, [[Tharpa Publications]] (2nd. ed., 1997) {{ISBN|978-0-948006-78-4}}</ref> \"Knowing\" refers to the fact that mind is aware of the contents of experience, and that, in order to exist, mind must be cognizing an object. You cannot have a mind \u2013 whose function is to cognize an object \u2013 existing without cognizing an object.\n\nMind, in Buddhism, is also described as being \"space-like\" and \"illusion-like\". Mind is space-like in the sense that it is not physically obstructive. It has no qualities which would prevent it from existing. In [[Mahayana]] Buddhism, mind is illusion-like in the sense that it is empty of inherent existence. This does not mean it does not exist, it means that it exists in a manner that is counter to our ordinary way of misperceiving how phenomena exist, according to Buddhism. When the mind is itself cognized properly, without misperceiving its mode of existence, it appears to exist like an illusion. There is a big difference however between being \"space and illusion\" and being \"space-like\" and \"illusion-like\". Mind is not composed of space, it just shares some descriptive similarities to space. Mind is not an illusion, it just shares some descriptive qualities with illusions.\n\nBuddhism posits that there is no inherent, unchanging identity (Inherent I, Inherent Me) or phenomena (Ultimate self, inherent self, Atman, Soul, Self-essence, Jiva, Ishvara, humanness essence, etc.) which is the experiencer of our experiences and the agent of our actions. In other words, human beings consist of merely a body and a mind, and nothing extra. Within the body there is no part or set of parts which is \u2013 by itself or themselves \u2013 the person. Similarly, within the mind there is no part or set of parts which are themselves \"the person\". A human being merely consists of five aggregates, or ''[[skandha]]s'' and nothing else.\n\nIn the same way, \"mind\" is what can be validly conceptually labelled onto our mere experience of clarity and knowing. There is something separate and apart from clarity and knowing which is \"Awareness\", in Buddhism. \"Mind\" is that part of experience the sixth sense door, which can be validly referred to as mind by the concept-term \"mind\". There is also not \"objects out there, mind in here, and experience somewhere in-between\". There is a third thing called \"awareness\" which exists being aware of the contents of mind and what mind cognizes. There are five senses (arising of mere experience: shapes, colors, the components of smell, components of taste, components of sound, components of touch) and mind as the sixth institution; this means, expressly, that there can be a third thing called \"awareness\" and a third thing called \"experiencer who is aware of the experience\". This awareness is deeply related to \"no-self\" because it does not judge the experience with craving or aversion.\n\nClearly, the experience arises and is known by mind, but there is a third thing calls [[Sati (Buddhism)|Sati]] what is the \"real experiencer of the experience\" that sits apart from the experience and which can be aware of the experience in 4 levels. (Maha Sathipatthana Sutta.)\n# Body\n# Sensations (Changes of the body mind.)\n# Mind,\n# Contents of the mind. (Changes of the body mind.)\n\nTo be aware of these four levels one needs to cultivate equanimity toward Craving and Aversion. This is Called Vipassana which is different from the way of reacting with  Craving and Aversion. This is the state of being aware and equanimous to the complete experience of here and now. This is the way of Buddhism, with regards to mind and the ultimate nature of minds (and persons).\n\n===Mortality of the mind===\n{{Main|Consciousness after death}}\nDue to the [[mind\u2013body problem]], a lot of interest and debate surrounds the question of what happens to one's conscious mind as one's body dies. During [[brain death]] all [[brain activity|brain function]] permanently ceases. According to some neuroscientific views which see these processes as the physical basis of mental phenomena, the mind fails to survive brain death and ceases to exist. This permanent loss of consciousness after death is sometimes called \"[[eternal oblivion]]\". The belief that some [[spirit]]ual or [[incorporeal]] component ([[soul]]) exists and that it is preserved after death is described by the term \"[[afterlife]]\".\n\n==In pseudoscience==\n===Parapsychology===\n[[Parapsychology]] is a study of certain types of [[paranormal phenomena]], or of phenomena which appear to be paranormal or not have any scientific basis <ref>[http://parapsych.org/glossary_l_r.html#p Parapsychological Association website, Glossary of Key Words Frequently Used in Parapsychology] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100824232035/http://parapsych.org/glossary_l_r.html |date=2010-08-24 }}, Retrieved February 10, 2007</ref>, for instance, [[precognition]], [[telekinesis]] and [[telepathy]].\n\nThe term is based on the Greek [[:wikt:para-|para]] (beside/beyond), [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] (soul/mind), and [[logos]] (account/explanation) and was coined by psychologist [[Max Dessoir]] in or before 1889.<ref name = \"EncyOccult\"/> [[J.B.

Words that refer to similar concepts and processes include [[deliberation]], [[cognition]], [[idea]]tion, [[discourse]] and [[imagination]].\n\nThinking is sometimes described as a \"higher\" [[cognitive]] function and the analysis of thinking processes is a part of [[cognitive psychology]]. It is also deeply connected with our capacity to make and use [[tools]]; to understand [[causality|cause and effect]]; to recognize patterns of significance; to comprehend and [[world disclosure|disclose]] unique contexts of experience or activity; and to respond to the world in a meaningful way.\n\n[[Memory]] is the ability to preserve, retain, and subsequently recall, knowledge, information or experience. Although memory has traditionally been a persistent theme in [[philosophy]], the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries also saw the study of memory emerge as a subject of inquiry within the paradigms of [[cognitive psychology]]. In recent decades, it has become one of the pillars of a new branch of science called [[cognitive neuroscience]], a marriage between [[cognitive psychology]] and [[neuroscience]].\n\n[[Imagination]] is the activity of generating or evoking novel situations, [[image]]s, ideas or other [[qualia]] in the mind. It is a characteristically [[Subjectivity|subjective]] ''activity'', rather than a direct or passive experience. The term is technically used in [[psychology]] for the process of reviving in the mind [[perception|percepts]] of objects formerly given in sense perception. Since this use of the term conflicts with that of ordinary [[language]], some psychologists have preferred to describe this process as \"[[wikt:Imaging|imaging]]\" or \"[[wikt:Imagery|imagery]]\" or to speak of it as \"reproductive\" as opposed to \"productive\" or \"constructive\" imagination. Things imagined are said to be seen in the \"[[mind's eye]]\". Among the many practical functions of imagination are the ability to project possible futures (or histories), to \"see\" things from another's perspective, and to change the way something is perceived, including to make decisions to respond to, or enact, what is imagined.\n\n[[Consciousness]] in [[Mammal|mammals]] (this includes humans) is an aspect of the mind generally thought to comprise qualities such as [[subjectivity]], [[sentience]], and the ability to [[perception|perceive]] the relationship between [[Personal identity|oneself]] and one's [[environment (biophysical)|environment]]. It is a subject of much research in [[philosophy of mind]], [[psychology]], [[neuroscience]], and [[cognitive science]]. Some philosophers divide [[consciousness]] into [[phenomena]]l consciousness, which is subjective experience itself, and access consciousness, which refers to the global availability of information to processing systems in the brain.<ref name=\"Bl\">Ned Block: \"On a Confusion about a Function of Consciousness\" in: ''The Behavioral and Brain Sciences'', 1995.</ref> Phenomenal consciousness has many different experienced qualities, often referred to as [[qualia]]. Phenomenal consciousness is usually consciousness ''of'' something or ''about'' something, a property known as [[intentionality]] in philosophy of mind.\n\n==Mental content==\nMental contents are those items that are thought of as being \"in\" the mind, and capable of being formed and manipulated by mental processes and faculties. Examples include [[thought]]s, [[concept]]s, [[memories]], [[emotion]]s, [[percept]]s and [[intention]]s. Philosophical theories of mental content include [[internalism]], [[externalism]], [[direct and indirect realism|representationalism]] and [[intentionality]].<ref>{{cite encyclopedia | url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/content-narrow/ | title=Narrow Mental Content | encyclopedia=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy | accessdate=7 September 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Memetics===\n[[Memetics]] is a theory of mental content based on an analogy with [[Darwinian evolution]], which was originated by [[Richard Dawkins]] and [[Douglas Hofstadter]] in the 1980s. It is an [[evolutionary model]] of cultural [[information transfer]]. A [[meme]], analogous to a [[gene]], is an idea, belief, pattern of behaviour (etc.) \"hosted\" in one or more individual minds, and can reproduce itself from mind to mind. Thus what would otherwise be regarded as one individual influencing another to adopt a belief, is seen memetically as a meme reproducing itself.\n\n==Relation to the brain==\n{{See also|Cognitive neuroscience}}\n\nIn animals, the [[brain]], or ''encephalon'' ([[Greek (language)|Greek]] for \"in the head\"), is the control center of the [[central nervous system]], responsible for [[thought]]. In most animals, the brain is located in the head, protected by the [[skull]] and close to the primary sensory apparatus of [[Visual perception|vision]], [[Hearing (sense)|hearing]], [[equilibrioception]], [[taste]] and [[olfaction]]. While all [[vertebrate]]s have a brain, most [[invertebrate]]s have either a centralized brain or collections of individual [[ganglion|ganglia]]. Primitive animals such as [[sponge]]s do not have a brain at all. Brains can be extremely complex. For example, the [[human brain]] contains around 86 billion [[neuron]]s, each linked to as many as 10,000 others.<ref>{{cite book|last=Whishaw|first=Bryan Kolb, Ian Q.|title=An Introduction to Brain and Behavior|year=2010|publisher=Worth Publishers|location=New York|isbn=978-0-7167-7691-8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zIBEEP2b1MIC|edition=3rd |accessdate=11 May 2012|page=72}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Sherwood|first=Lauralee|title=Fundamentals of Human Physiology|year=2011|publisher=Brooks/Cole Cengage Learning|location=Belmont, CA|isbn=978-0-8400-6225-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jl4rLDuewo4C|edition=4th |accessdate=11 May 2012|page=91}}</ref>\n\nUnderstanding the relationship between the brain and the mind&nbsp;\u2013 [[mind\u2013body problem]] is one of the central issues in the history of [[philosophy]]&nbsp;\u2013 is a challenging problem both philosophically and scientifically.<ref>Patricia Smith Churchland, [https://books.google.com/books?id=hAeFMFW3rDUC ''Neurophilosophy: toward a unified science of the mind-brain''], MIT Press, 1989</ref> There are three major philosophical schools of thought concerning the answer: dualism, materialism, and idealism.

This view was first advocated in [[Western Philosophy]] by [[Parmenides]] in the 5th Century BC and was later espoused by the 17th Century [[Rationalism|rationalist]] [[Baruch Spinoza]].<ref name=\"Spin\">Spinoza, Baruch (1670) ''Tractatus Theologico-Politicus'' (A Theologico-Political Treatise).</ref> According to Spinoza's [[dual-aspect theory]], mind and body are two aspects of an underlying reality which he variously described as \"Nature\" or \"God\".\n* ''[[Physicalism|Physicalists]]'' argue that only the entities postulated by physical theory exist, and that the mind will eventually be explained in terms of these entities as physical theory continues to evolve.\n* ''[[idealism (philosophy)|Idealists]]'' maintain that the mind is all that exists and that the external world is either mental itself, or an illusion created by the mind.\n* ''[[neutral monism|Neutral monists]]'' adhere to the position that perceived things in the world can be regarded as either physical or mental depending on whether one is interested in their relationship to other things in the world or their relationship to the perceiver. For example, a red spot on a wall is physical in its dependence on the wall and the pigment of which it is made, but it is mental in so far as its perceived redness depends on the workings of the visual system. Unlike dual-aspect theory, neutral monism does not posit a more fundamental substance of which mind and body are aspects.\n\nThe most common monisms in the 20th and 21st centuries have all been variations of physicalism; these positions include [[behaviorism]], the [[type physicalism|type identity theory]], [[anomalous monism]] and [[functionalism (philosophy of mind)|functionalism]].<ref name=\"Kim\">Kim, J., \"Mind-Body Problem\", ''Oxford Companion to Philosophy''.

Psychological patterns can be understood as low cost ways of information processing.<ref>{{Cite book|title = The Unity of Science and Economics: A New Foundation of Economic Theory|last = Chen|first = Jing|publisher = Springer|year = 2015|isbn = |location = https://www.springer.com/us/book/9781493934645}}</ref>  Psychology also refers to the application of such [[knowledge]] to various spheres of [[Human behavior|human activity]], including problems of individuals' [[everyday life|daily lives]] and the treatment of [[mental health]] problems.\n\nPsychology differs from the other [[social sciences]] (e.g. [[anthropology]], [[economics]], [[political science]], and [[sociology]]) due to its focus on [[experimentation]] at the scale of the individual, or individuals in small groups as opposed to [[group (sociology)|large groups]], [[institutions]] or [[societies]]. Historically, psychology differed from [[biology]] and [[neuroscience]] in that it was primarily concerned with mind rather than brain. Modern psychological science incorporates [[Psychophysiology|physiological]] and [[neuropsychology|neurological]] processes into its conceptions of [[perception]], [[cognition]], behaviour, and [[mental disorders]].\n\n==Mental health==\n{{Main|Mental health}}\n\nBy analogy with the health of the body, one can speak metaphorically of a state of health of the mind, or [[mental health]]. [[Merriam-Webster]] defines mental health as \"A state of emotional and psychological well-being in which an individual is able to use his or her cognitive and emotional capabilities, function in society, and meet the ordinary demands of everyday life.\" According to the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO), there is no one \"official\" definition of mental health. Cultural differences, subjective assessments, and competing professional theories all affect how \"mental health\" is defined. In general, most experts agree that \"mental health\" and \"[[mental disorder]]\" are not opposites. In other words, the absence of a recognized mental disorder is not necessarily an indicator of mental health.\n\nOne way to think about mental health is by looking at how effectively and successfully a person functions. Feeling capable and competent; being able to handle normal levels of stress, maintaining satisfying relationships, and leading an independent life; and being able to \"bounce back,\" or recover from difficult situations, are all signs of mental health.\n\n[[Psychotherapy]] is an [[interpersonal]], [[Interpersonal relationship|relational]] intervention used by trained psychotherapists to aid [[wikt:Client|clients]] in problems of living. This usually includes increasing individual sense of [[well-being]] and reducing subjective discomforting experience. Psychotherapists employ a range of techniques based on experiential relationship building, [[dialogue]], [[communication]] and [[behavior]] change and that are designed to improve the [[mental health]] of a client or patient, or to improve group relationships (such as in a [[family]]). Most forms of psychotherapy use only spoken [[conversation]], though some also use various other forms of communication such as the written word, [[art]], [[drama]], [[narrative]] story, or therapeutic touch. Psychotherapy occurs within a structured encounter between a trained [[therapist]] and client(s). Purposeful, theoretically based psychotherapy began in the 19th century with [[psychoanalysis]]; since then, scores of other approaches have been developed and continue to be created.\n\n==Non-human minds==\n\n===Animal intelligence===\n[[Animal cognition]], or cognitive ethology, is the title given to a modern approach to the mental capacities of animals. It has developed out of [[comparative psychology]], but has also been strongly influenced by the approach of [[ethology]], [[behavioral ecology]], and [[evolutionary psychology]]. Much of what used to be considered under the title of \"animal intelligence\" is now thought of under this heading. [[Animal language acquisition]], attempting to discern or understand the degree to which animal cognition can be revealed by [[linguistics]]-related study, has been controversial among [[cognitive linguistics|cognitive linguists]].\n\n===Artificial intelligence===\n{{more citations needed section|date=September 2007}}\n{{Main|Philosophy of artificial intelligence}}\n\n[[File:Forest of synthetic pyramidal dendrites grown using Cajal's laws of neuronal branching.png|thumb|[[Computer simulation]] of the branching architecture of the [[dendrite]]s of [[pyramidal neuron]]s.<ref>{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1371/image.pcbi.v06.i08 | title = PLoS Computational Biology Issue Image &#124; Vol. 6(8) August 2010 | journal = PLOS Computational Biology | volume = 6 | issue = 8 | pages = ev06.ei08 | year = 2010 | pmid =  | pmc = | doi-access = free }}</ref>]] In 1950 [[Alan M. Turing]] published \"Computing machinery and intelligence\" in ''[[Mind (journal)|Mind]]'', in which he proposed that machines could be tested for intelligence using questions and answers. This process is now named the [[Turing Test]]. The term [[Artificial Intelligence]] (AI) was first used by [[John McCarthy (computer scientist)|John McCarthy]] who considered it to mean \"the science and engineering of making intelligent machines\".<ref>What is Artificial Intelligence? by John McCarthy [http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/whatisai/whatisai.html Stanford University] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151118212402/http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/whatisai/whatisai.html |date=2015-11-18 }}</ref> It can also refer to [[intelligence (trait)|intelligence]] as exhibited by an artificial (''man-made'', ''non-natural'', ''manufactured'') entity. AI is studied in overlapping fields of [[computer science]], [[psychology]], [[neuroscience]] and [[engineering]], dealing with intelligent [[behavior]], [[learn]]ing and [[adaptation]] and usually developed using customized [[machine]]s or [[computer]]s.\n\nResearch in AI is concerned with producing machines to automate tasks requiring intelligent behavior. Examples include [[control system|control]], [[Automated planning and scheduling|planning and scheduling]], the ability to answer diagnostic and consumer questions, [[handwriting recognition|handwriting]], [[natural language]], [[speech recognition|speech]] and [[facial recognition system|facial recognition]]. As such, the study of AI has also become an engineering discipline, focused on providing solutions to real life problems, [[knowledge mining]], [[software]] applications, [[strategy games]] like [[computer chess]] and other [[video game]]s. One of the biggest limitations of AI is in the domain of actual machine comprehension. Consequentially [[natural language understanding]] and [[connectionism]] (where behavior of neural networks is investigated) are areas of active research and development.\n\nThe debate about the nature of the mind is relevant to the development of [[artificial intelligence]]. If the mind is indeed a thing separate from or higher than the functioning of the brain, then hypothetically it would be much more difficult to recreate within a machine, if it were possible at all. If, on the other hand, the mind is no more than the aggregated functions of the brain, then it will be possible to create a machine with a recognisable mind (though possibly only with computers much different from today's), by simple virtue of the fact that such a machine already exists in the form of the human brain.\n\n==In religion==\nMany religions associate spiritual qualities to the human mind. These are often tightly connected to their [[mythology]] and ideas of [[afterlife]].\n\nThe [[India]]n [[philosopher]]-sage [[Sri Aurobindo]] attempted to unite the Eastern and Western psychological traditions with his [[integral psychology (Sri Aurobindo)|integral psychology]], as have many philosophers and [[New religious movement]]s. [[Judaism]] teaches that \"moach shalit al halev\", the mind rules the heart. Humans can approach the Divine intellectually, through learning and behaving according to the Divine Will as enclothed in the Torah, and use that deep logical understanding to elicit and guide emotional arousal during prayer. [[Christianity]] has tended to see the mind as distinct from the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] (Greek ''[[nous]]'') and sometimes further distinguished from the [[spirit]]. [[Esotericism|Western esoteric traditions]] sometimes refer to a [[mental body]] that exists on a plane other than the physical. [[Hinduism]]'s various philosophical schools have debated whether the human [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] (Sanskrit ''[[Atman (Hinduism)|atman]]'') is distinct from, or identical to, ''[[Brahman]]'', the [[divinity|divine]] [[reality]]. [[Taoism]] sees the human being as contiguous with natural forces, and the mind as not separate from the [[Human body|body]]. [[Confucianism]] sees the mind, like the body, as inherently perfectible.\n\n===Buddhism===\n{{See also|Buddhism and psychology|Vij\u00f1\u0101na|\u015a\u016bnyat\u0101|Shentong|Rangtong|Yogacara}}\n\nBuddhist teachings explain the moment-to-moment manifestation of the mind-stream.<ref name=\"Karunamuni2017\"/><ref name=\"Aggregates\"/> The components that make up the mind are known as the five aggregates (i.e., material form, feelings, perception, volition, and sensory consciousness), which arise and pass away continuously. The arising and passing of these aggregates in the present moment is described as being influenced by five causal laws: biological laws, psychological laws, physical laws, volitional laws, and universal laws.<ref name=\"Aggregates\"/><ref name=\"Karunamuni2017\"/> The Buddhist practice of [[mindfulness]] involves attending to this constantly changing mind-stream.\n\nAccording to [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] philosopher [[Dharmakirti]], the mind has two fundamental qualities: \"clarity and cognizes\". If something is not those two qualities, it cannot validly be called mind. \"Clarity\" refers to the fact that mind has no color, shape, size, location, weight, or any other physical characteristic, and \"cognizes\" that it functions to know or perceive objects.<ref>Gyatso, [[Geshe Kelsang Gyatso]], ''Understanding the Mind'': The Nature and Power of the Mind, [[Tharpa Publications]] (2nd. ed., 1997) {{ISBN|978-0-948006-78-4}}</ref> \"Knowing\" refers to the fact that mind is aware of the contents of experience, and that, in order to exist, mind must be cognizing an object. You cannot have a mind \u2013 whose function is to cognize an object \u2013 existing without cognizing an object.\n\nMind, in Buddhism, is also described as being \"space-like\" and \"illusion-like\". Mind is space-like in the sense that it is not physically obstructive. It has no qualities which would prevent it from existing. In [[Mahayana]] Buddhism, mind is illusion-like in the sense that it is empty of inherent existence. This does not mean it does not exist, it means that it exists in a manner that is counter to our ordinary way of misperceiving how phenomena exist, according to Buddhism. When the mind is itself cognized properly, without misperceiving its mode of existence, it appears to exist like an illusion. There is a big difference however between being \"space and illusion\" and being \"space-like\" and \"illusion-like\". Mind is not composed of space, it just shares some descriptive similarities to space. Mind is not an illusion, it just shares some descriptive qualities with illusions.\n\nBuddhism posits that there is no inherent, unchanging identity (Inherent I, Inherent Me) or phenomena (Ultimate self, inherent self, Atman, Soul, Self-essence, Jiva, Ishvara, humanness essence, etc.) which is the experiencer of our experiences and the agent of our actions. In other words, human beings consist of merely a body and a mind, and nothing extra. Within the body there is no part or set of parts which is \u2013 by itself or themselves \u2013 the person. Similarly, within the mind there is no part or set of parts which are themselves \"the person\". A human being merely consists of five aggregates, or ''[[skandha]]s'' and nothing else.\n\nIn the same way, \"mind\" is what can be validly conceptually labelled onto our mere experience of clarity and knowing. There is something separate and apart from clarity and knowing which is \"Awareness\", in Buddhism. \"Mind\" is that part of experience the sixth sense door, which can be validly referred to as mind by the concept-term \"mind\". There is also not \"objects out there, mind in here, and experience somewhere in-between\". There is a third thing called \"awareness\" which exists being aware of the contents of mind and what mind cognizes. There are five senses (arising of mere experience: shapes, colors, the components of smell, components of taste, components of sound, components of touch) and mind as the sixth institution; this means, expressly, that there can be a third thing called \"awareness\" and a third thing called \"experiencer who is aware of the experience\". This awareness is deeply related to \"no-self\" because it does not judge the experience with craving or aversion.\n\nClearly, the experience arises and is known by mind, but there is a third thing calls [[Sati (Buddhism)|Sati]] what is the \"real experiencer of the experience\" that sits apart from the experience and which can be aware of the experience in 4 levels. (Maha Sathipatthana Sutta.)\n# Body\n# Sensations (Changes of the body mind.)\n# Mind,\n# Contents of the mind. (Changes of the body mind.)\n\nTo be aware of these four levels one needs to cultivate equanimity toward Craving and Aversion. This is Called Vipassana which is different from the way of reacting with  Craving and Aversion. This is the state of being aware and equanimous to the complete experience of here and now. This is the way of Buddhism, with regards to mind and the ultimate nature of minds (and persons).\n\n===Mortality of the mind===\n{{Main|Consciousness after death}}\nDue to the [[mind\u2013body problem]], a lot of interest and debate surrounds the question of what happens to one's conscious mind as one's body dies. During [[brain death]] all [[brain activity|brain function]] permanently ceases. According to some neuroscientific views which see these processes as the physical basis of mental phenomena, the mind fails to survive brain death and ceases to exist. This permanent loss of consciousness after death is sometimes called \"[[eternal oblivion]]\". The belief that some [[spirit]]ual or [[incorporeal]] component ([[soul]]) exists and that it is preserved after death is described by the term \"[[afterlife]]\".\n\n==In pseudoscience==\n===Parapsychology===\n[[Parapsychology]] is a study of certain types of [[paranormal phenomena]], or of phenomena which appear to be paranormal or not have any scientific basis <ref>[http://parapsych.org/glossary_l_r.html#p Parapsychological Association website, Glossary of Key Words Frequently Used in Parapsychology] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100824232035/http://parapsych.org/glossary_l_r.html |date=2010-08-24 }}, Retrieved February 10, 2007</ref>, for instance, [[precognition]], [[telekinesis]] and [[telepathy]].\n\nThe term is based on the Greek [[:wikt:para-|para]] (beside/beyond), [[Psyche (psychology)|psyche]] (soul/mind), and [[logos]] (account/explanation) and was coined by psychologist [[Max Dessoir]] in or before 1889.<ref name = \"EncyOccult\"/> [[J.B.

Around the time of the [[American Revolution]], Milltown became more commonly known as Downingtown after the prominent businessman Thomas Downing,<ref>{{cite book | url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_9V1IAAAAMAAJ | title=The Origin of Certain Place Names in the United States | publisher=Govt.

The town was officially named Downingtown in 1812.\n\nThe town is located along the [[Lincoln Highway]] (now part of [[U.S. Route 30]]) which runs from the East Coast to the West Coast. It was an early westward road in the wagon days as the [[Philadelphia and Lancaster Turnpike]]. The Lincoln Highway was the first paved road to cross the nation from the [[Atlantic]] to the [[Pacific]]. Construction of the [[Pennsylvania Turnpike]] started in the early 1940s and was completed in the early 1950s; it runs north of US 30, bypassing Downingtown.\n[[File:Downingtown Log House.JPG|thumb|upright=1.2|Downingtown Log House]]\nAbout 1705 Sami Warren built what has become known as the [[Downingtown Log House]].  In 1713 the next owner Hickman sold the 1\u00bd story, 21' 9\"\u00d725' structure to Thomas and Mary Moore. Thomas Moore moved from the Log House in 1729 and died in 1738.\n\nThomas Downing acquired the Log House in 1739. It remained in the Downing family until 1940, when Thomas W. Downing died and left it to the borough of Downingtown. The borough did some restoration work to the [[Downingtown Log House]] in 1947. It served as the home to the Downingtown Chamber of Commerce from 1950 until 1988. But the Log House was deteriorating as Route 30 had been built close to it. Located {{convert|18|in|cm}} below street level, the house suffered water damage due to runoff from Route 30 and vibration from traffic weakened the structure.\n\nFrom 1988 until 1990 the Downingtown Historical Society relocated the house and did an extensive restoration with money raised for the project. It now sits approximately {{convert|70|ft|0}} west of its original location, {{convert|22|ft}} from the Route 30 sidewalk, and slightly above street level.<ref>[http://www.downingtownhistoricalsociety.org/loghouse.htm \"Log House\"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726003020/http://www.downingtownhistoricalsociety.org/loghouse.htm |date=July 26, 2011 }}, Downington Historical Society</ref>\n\nIn 1904 [[John S.

Downingtown was settled by English and European colonists in the early 18th century and has a number of historic buildings and structures.\n\n==History==\n[[File:Downingtown, Pennsylvania (6479475337) (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|[[Keystone Marker]]]]\nThe town was originally named Milltown due to its number of mills along the [[East Branch Brandywine Creek]], the first of which was founded by Daniel Butter. The Butter family also had paper mills in the area, and [[Frederick Bicking]] from [[Winterburg]], Germany, was the patriarch of the Bicking paper families. Around the time of the [[American Revolution]], Milltown became more commonly known as Downingtown after the prominent businessman Thomas Downing,<ref>{{cite book | url=https://archive.org/details/bub_gb_9V1IAAAAMAAJ | title=The Origin of Certain Place Names in the United States | publisher=Govt.

The town was officially named Downingtown in 1812.\n\nThe town is located along the [[Lincoln Highway]] (now part of [[U.S. Route 30]]) which runs from the East Coast to the West Coast. It was an early westward road in the wagon days as the [[Philadelphia and Lancaster Turnpike]]. The Lincoln Highway was the first paved road to cross the nation from the [[Atlantic]] to the [[Pacific]]. Construction of the [[Pennsylvania Turnpike]] started in the early 1940s and was completed in the early 1950s; it runs north of US 30, bypassing Downingtown.\n[[File:Downingtown Log House.JPG|thumb|upright=1.2|Downingtown Log House]]\nAbout 1705 Sami Warren built what has become known as the [[Downingtown Log House]].  In 1713 the next owner Hickman sold the 1\u00bd story, 21' 9\"\u00d725' structure to Thomas and Mary Moore. Thomas Moore moved from the Log House in 1729 and died in 1738.\n\nThomas Downing acquired the Log House in 1739. It remained in the Downing family until 1940, when Thomas W. Downing died and left it to the borough of Downingtown. The borough did some restoration work to the [[Downingtown Log House]] in 1947.

He attended [[Yale University]] with president [[George H. W. Bush]], graduated in 1950, the year after George H. W. Bush, and is a member of the secret society [[Skull and Bones]]. After graduating from college, Draper served as a second lieutenant in the [[Korean War]]. Upon returning to the United States, he attended [[Harvard Business School]] and studied under professor [[Georges Doriot]], who is often credited with starting the venture capital industry. Draper graduated with a Masters of Business degree, with distinction, in 1954. He then worked from 1954 to 1959 as a steel salesman at Chicago's [[Inland Steel Company]].\n\n==Early venture capital==\nIn 1959, Draper left Chicago to work as an associate at his father's newly formed firm, Draper, Gaither & Anderson, the first [[venture capital]] company on the West Coast. In 1962, Draper left Draper, Gaither & Anderson to co-found the [[venture capital]] firm Draper & Johnson Investment Company with his good friend Pitch Johnson, whom he had met while working at Inland Steel. In 1965, Draper founded [[Sutter Hill Ventures]], which to this day remains one of the top venture capital firms in the country. During his twenty years as the senior partner of Sutter Hill, Draper helped to organize and finance several hundred high technology manufacturing companies. In 1986, he became the head of the world's largest source of multilateral development grant assistance, the United Nations Development Programme, and was instrumental in leadership of several global initiatives, such as the international Education for All movement (beginning formally with the 1990 Conference in Jomtien, Thailand), the 1995 Beijing Women's' Conference, and the 1995 Social Summit in Copenhagen, Denmark.\n\n==Sabbatical from Silicon Valley \u2013 public service==\nDraper has played an international leadership role in expanding the world economy and the global wealth gap.<ref>Credit Suisse Research Institute.

In 2002, he co-founded Draper Richards LP, a venture capital fund that invests in early-stage technology companies in the U.S., and he also founded Draper Investment Company, which concentrates on seed investments in Europe and Asia.\n\n==Draper Richards Kaplan Foundation==\nIn 2002, along with Robin Richards Donohoe, Draper co-founded the Draper Richards Foundation.  [[Robert Steven Kaplan]], formerly vice-chairman of Goldman Sachs and currently the thirteenth president and CEO of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, joined as co-chair in 2010.\n\nThe [[Draper Richards Kaplan Foundation]] is a global venture philanthropy firm that supports early-stage, high impact social enterprises. The Draper Richards Kaplan Foundation believes that with early funding and rigorous support, exceptional leaders, tackling some of society's most complex problems, can make the world a better place. The Draper Richard Kaplan Foundation finds, funds and supports these organizations with three years of unrestricted funding and actively partners with them to help them build their organizations to scale and achieve their mission.\n\nThe Draper Richards Kaplan Foundation invests in early-stage organizations and is oftentimes the first institutional investor and first \"outside\" board member for these organizations. Their current portfolio includes organizations working both domestically and internationally helping to provide critical access to healthcare, education, legal resources, economic empowerment, food security, social justice, water and sanitation, transparency and accountability, and shelter.\n\nSince starting in 2002, Draper Richards Kaplan Foundation has invested in 155 social entrepreneurs working in a variety of issue areas and their results speak for themselves, as one of the earliest funders of Kiva, Room to Read, Grassroots Soccer, One Acre Fund, FoodCorps, and many others. Currently, Draper Richards Kaplan Foundation is deploying their third fund of $65 million to support the next generation of 100 social enterprises that can change the world.\n\n==Community service==\nAs a civic leader, Draper has been involved in many community service programs.  He is currently on the boards of The Draper Richards Kaplan Foundation, Freeman Spogli Institute of International Studies at [[Stanford University]], World Affairs Council of Northern California, and the [[Harvard Business School]] California Research Center Advisory Board.

He is married to Phyllis Culbertson Draper, who passed away after a 34-year battle with [[Parkinson's disease]], and are the parents of Becky Draper, actress/filmmaker [[Polly Draper]], who is known for her starring role in the ABC television drama ''[[Thirtysomething (TV series)|Thirtysomething]]'', and [[Timothy C.

Dormont's economic stability can be attributed to this diversity along with its close proximity to jobs in Downtown Pittsburgh, access to The \"T\" ([[Pittsburgh Light Rail]]), diverse housing stock, and historically low crime rates.  Dormont is mixed use and urban and features a pedestrian friendly business district, with bars, coffee shops, restaurants, and retail stores.  It is famous for one of the largest municipal pools in Pennsylvania, the historic Dormont Pool. Loosely translated, Dormont means \"Mountain of Gold\" in [[French language|French]].\n\n==History==\n[[Image:dormontpool.jpg|thumb|The Dormont Pool will celebrate its 100th anniversary in 2020.]]\nThe territory in which Dormont Borough is situated was held by the Delaware and Shawnee tribes until 1768 when the territory was part of the transaction in which Fort Stanwix was purchased from the Six Nations. In following years, Dormont\u2019s area was part of Cumberland County, Pitt Township in Bedford County, Penn Township in Washington County, and finally, St. Clair Township in Allegheny County in 1788.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boro.dormont.pa.us/index.asp?Type=B_BASIC&SEC=AF2F7BCA-1489-4CF5-BBA1-6A0218FB280A|title=Archived copy|access-date=2015-08-11|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151007070332/http://www.boro.dormont.pa.us/index.asp?SEC=AF2F7BCA-1489-4CF5-BBA1-6A0218FB280A&Type=B_BASIC|archive-date=2015-10-07|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nDormont was originally fashioned from parts of Scott and Union Townships. An order of incorporation was signed on March 31, 1909, making Dormont the first independent municipality in the South Hills of Allegheny County.  Municipal officials initially wanted to name the new community \"Mt. Lebanon,\" however objections were raised by their as yet unincorporated neighbors to the south who eventually adopted the name.  Instead the name Dormont was chosen from the Americanized version of the French term \"mont d'or\", loosely translated as \"Mountain of Gold.\"<ref>{{cite news | url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=a4NIAAAAIBAJ&sjid=G24DAAAAIBAJ&pg=7226%2C2342598 | title=Town names carry bit of history | work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette | date=May 10, 1984 | accessdate=31 October 2015 | author=Ackerman, Jan | pages=6}}</ref>\n\nThe first election of Borough officials was held on April 27, 1909. Dormont later annexed part of Scott Township in 1909, two additional parts of Union Township in 1913 and 1916, and a portion of Mt.

Today, all but two of Dormont's \"side streets\" are designated as avenues, the exceptions being Memorial Drive and Park Blvd.   Two of Dormont's mainline streets, Scott Road and McFarland Road, are two-lane \"borough line\" streets in which one lane is located in Dormont and the other in Mt. Lebanon.  The northern stretch of another \"borough line\" street, McNeilly Avenue, runs through Dormont on one side and the Pittsburgh neighborhood of Brookline on the other.  Before the incorporation and street name changes, Dormont actually had four designated \"streets\": Beech St. (Dwight Ave.), Sycamore St. (Philadelphia Ave.), Sylvester St. (Texas Ave.) and \"C\" St. (Miles Ave.).\n\n===Leisure===\n[[Image:dormont playground.jpg|frame|right|Dormont Park Playground]]\n\nThrough the years, the convenience of the borough, plus the amenities offered its residents, has kept it densely populated. Its citizens enjoy one of the largest swimming pools in Pennsylvania (>60,000 square feet), two parks, basketball and tennis courts, two Little League fields, a fine library, an impressive volunteer-built children's playground, as well as seasonal activities for both children and adults.  \"Dormont Day,\" the annual Fourth of July park-wide event, is the highlight of the summer season and features all day family entertainment beginning with the 8:00&nbsp;a.m. Twenty-One Gun Salute and culminating with one of the most spectacular fireworks displays for a community of this size.  During the day, park goers are treated to live music, picnics, food booths, games, pony rides, and youth foot races.\nIn the fall, Dormont hosts the Dormont Street and Music Festival, featuring two stages of bands playing a variety of music from 2:00 - 10:00 PM.\n\n==Government and Politics==\n{| align=\"center\" border=\"2\" cellpadding=\"4\" cellspacing=\"0\" style=\"float:right; margin: 1em 1em 1em 0; border: 1px #aaa solid; border-collapse: collapse; font-size: 95%;\"\n|+ '''Presidential Elections Results'''<ref>{{cite web|last1=EL|title=2012 Allegheny County election|url=http://triblive.com/politics/2907065-74/pittsburgh-ward-hills-west-borough-braddock-east-elizabeth-north-park|website=Pittsburgh Tribune-Review|accessdate=15 October 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=EL|title=2016 Pennsylvani general election...|url=http://newsinteractive.post-gazette.com/electionresultsgen2016/|website=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|accessdate=15 October 2017}}</ref>\n|- bgcolor=lightgrey\n!

A brand new building for the grade school was then built, bringing together students from the two previous grade schools, Kelton and Hillsdale.  The Kelton School building, located on a hillside adjacent to Keystone Oaks (corner of Kelton & Delwood Aves.), was razed also in 1996; it is now occupied with a soccer field.

Dormont is mixed use and urban and features a pedestrian friendly business district, with bars, coffee shops, restaurants, and retail stores.  It is famous for one of the largest municipal pools in Pennsylvania, the historic Dormont Pool.

Municipal officials initially wanted to name the new community \"Mt. Lebanon,\" however objections were raised by their as yet unincorporated neighbors to the south who eventually adopted the name.
