Clarke read mathematics for a year at the [[London School of Economics]], but then left university for a year to focus on playing the flute, where his teachers also included Kate Lukas.

He has given master classes at the [[Royal Academy of Music]], the [[Royal Scottish Academy]], the [[Royal Northern College of Music]], the [[Royal Welsh College of Music and Drama]] and [[Trinity College of Music]] and has regularly been invited to perform & lead workshops at numerous flute events and summer schools internationally.

In 2013, he took up teaching and performance at the Scottish Summer School.\n\nClarke made his international debut in 2001 as guest soloist at the International Flute Convention of the [[National Flute Association]] (NFA) in Dallas.  He was the guest artist at the 2003 Hungarian National Flute Event and a headline artist in the 2005 NFA convention in San Diego.  He has since performed as a featured guest soloist at major conventions in Italy, Brazil, Slovenia, Hungary, Netherlands and numerous times for the British Flute Society (BFS) and for the NFA.\n\nIn 2005, Clarke released his debut CD, ''Within'', which featured twelve of his own compositions.

The atoll's inhabitants were relocated in 1946, after which the islands and lagoon were the site of 23 [[Nuclear testing at Bikini Atoll|nuclear tests]] by the United States until 1958. \n\nThe atoll is at the northern end of the [[Ralik Chain]], approximately {{convert|850|km|mi}} northwest of the capital [[Majuro]]. Three families were resettled on Bikini island in 1970, totaling about 100 residents. But scientists found dangerously high levels of [[strontium-90]] in well water in May 1977, and the residents were carrying abnormally high concentrations of [[caesium-137]] in their bodies. They were evacuated in 1980. The atoll is occasionally visited today by divers and a few scientists, and is occupied by a handful of caretakers.\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nThe island's English name is derived from the German colonial name ''Bikini'' given to the atoll when it was part of [[German New Guinea]]. The German name is transliterated from the [[Marshallese language|Marshallese]] name for the island, {{lang|mh|Pikinni}}, ({{IPAc-mh|pikinniy}}) \"''Pik''\" meaning \"surface\" and \"''Ni''\" meaning \"coconut\", or ''surface of coconuts''.<ref name=turssel2/>\n\n== Culture ==\n{{main article|Marshallese culture}}\n[[File:Liijabor wearing nieded 1918.jpg|thumb|A woman named Liijabor from Likiep Island, [[Likiep Atoll]] in the [[Marshall Islands]], wears a traditional ''nieded'' or [[Ta'ovala|clothing mat]], {{circa}} 1918]]\n\nBikini islanders' traditional lifestyle was based on cultivating plants and eating shellfish and fish.

The islanders worked the [[copra]] plantations under the watchful eye of the Japanese, who took a portion of the sales. Chiefs could retain as much as $20,000 per year, and the remainder was distributed to the workers.

It has caused some Bikini islanders to become economically dependent on the payments from the trust fund. This dependency has eroded individuals' interest in traditional economic pursuits like taro and copra production. The move also altered traditional patterns of social alliance and political organization. On Bikini, rights to land and land ownership were the major factor in social and political organization and leadership. After relocation and settlement on Kili, a dual system of land tenure evolved. Disbursements from the trust fund were based in part to land ownership on Bikini and based on current land tenure on Kili.<ref name=culture/>\n\nBefore the residents were relocated, they were led by a local chief and under the nominal control of the Paramount Chief of the Marshall Islands.

The testing began with the [[Operation Crossroads]] series in July 1946. The residents initially accepted resettlement voluntarily to [[Rongerik Atoll]], believing that they would be able to return home within a short time. However, Rongerik could not produce enough food, and the islanders starved. They could not return home, so they were relocated to [[Kwajalein Atoll]] for six months before choosing to live on [[Kili Island]], a small island one-sixth the size of their home island.

The explosions distributed vast amounts of irradiated, pulverized coral and mud across wide expanses of the lagoon and surrounding islands. {{As of|2008}}, the atoll had recovered nearly 65% of the biodiversity that existed prior to radioactive contamination, but 28 species of coral appear to be locally extinct.<ref name=richards>{{cite journal|title=Bikini Atoll coral biodiversity resilience five decades after nuclear testing|url=http://www.bikiniatoll.com/BIKINICORALS.pdf|journal=Marine Pollution Bulletin|volume=56|year=2008|pages=503\u2013515|accessdate=13 August 2013|authors=Zoe T.

It consists of traditional leaders (''[[Iroijlaplap]]''), known as the ''Council of Irooj'', who advise the lower house on traditional, cultural issues.<ref>{{cite web|title=History of the Nitijela|url=http://www.rminitijela.org/history/history.html|publisher=Republic of the Marshall Islands|accessdate=14 August 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727221448/http://www.rminitijela.org/history/history.html|archivedate=27 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}</ref> {{As of|2013}}, there are four members of the Council.\n\nThe lower house or ''Nitijela'' consists of 33 senators elected by 24 electoral districts.

It resulted in Spain's losing many of its remaining colonies; Cuba became nominally independent while the United States took possession of Puerto Rico and Spain's Pacific colonies of the Philippines and Guam. This left Spain with the remainder of the Spanish East Indies in the Pacific, about 6000 islands that were tiny and sparsely populated. After the loss of the administrative center of Manila, the minor islands became ungovernable and, after the entire loss of two Spanish fleets in 1898, indefensible.\n\nThe Spanish government sold the islands to Germany.<ref name=nitijela/> The treaty was signed on 12 February 1899, by Spanish Prime Minister Francisco Silvela, and transferred the Caroline Islands, the Mariana Islands, Palau and other possessions to Germany. The islands were then placed under control of German New Guinea.\n\n=== Japanese occupation ===\n\nBikini was captured along with the rest of the Marshall Islands by the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] in 1914 during [[World War I]] and mandated to the [[Empire of Japan]] by the [[League of Nations]] in 1920. The Japanese administered the island under the [[South Pacific Mandate]], but mostly left local affairs in the hands of traditional local leaders until the start of [[World War II]]. At the outset of the war, the Marshall Islands suddenly became a strategic outpost for the Japanese. They built and manned a watchtower on the island, an outpost for the Japanese headquarters on Kwajalein Atoll, to guard against an American invasion of the islands.<ref name=Niedenthal/>\n\n=== World War II ===\n{{main article|Battle of Kwajalein}}\n\nThe islands remained relatively unscathed by the war until February 1944, when in a bloody [[Battle of Kwajalein|battle]], the American forces captured Kwajalein Atoll. There were only five Japanese soldiers on Bikini and they committed suicide rather than allow themselves to be captured.<ref name=Niedenthal/>\n\nFor the U.S., the battle represented both the next step in its island-hopping march to Japan and a significant morale victory, as it was the first time the Americans had penetrated the \"outer ring\" of the Japanese Pacific sphere. For the Japanese, the battle represented the failure of the beach-line defense. Japanese defenses became prepared in depth, and the battles of Peleliu, Guam, and the Marianas proved far more costly to the U.S.\n\n=== Residents relocated ===\n{{main article|Nuclear testing at Bikini Atoll}}\n\n[[File:Leaving-bikini.jpg|thumb|7 March 1946, 161 residents of Bikini Island board LST 1108 as they depart from Bikini Atoll]]\n[[File:Operation Crossroads - Moving of Bikinians to Rongerik, March 7, 1946.jpg|thumb|Bikini islanders arrive on Rongerik Atoll and unload [[pandanus]] for thatching the roofs of their new buildings.<ref name=exhibtt>{{cite web|title=he Republic of the Marshall Islands and the United States: A Strategic Partnership|url=http://www.rmiembassyus.org/Exhib%20TT.htm|publisher=Embassy of the Marshall Islands of the United States|accessdate=18 August 2013|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130809062016/http://www.rmiembassyus.org/Exhib%20TT.htm|archivedate=9 August 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>]]\n\nAfter World War II, the United States was engaged in a [[Cold War]] [[Nuclear arms race]] with the [[Soviet Union]] to build bigger and more destructive bombs.<ref name=Niedenthal>{{cite web|last=Niedenthal|first=Jack|title=A Short History of the People of Bikini Atoll|url=http://www.bikiniatoll.com/history.html|accessdate=7 August 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070625154117/http://www.bikiniatoll.com/history.html|archivedate=25 June 2007|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nThe nuclear weapons testing at Bikini Atoll program was a series of 23 [[nuclear weapons|nuclear devices]] detonated by the United States between 1946 and 1958 at seven test sites. The test weapons were detonated on the reef itself, on the sea, in the air and underwater<ref name=richards/> with a combined fission yield of 42.2 [[TNT equivalent|Mt]]. The testing began with the [[Operation Crossroads]] series in July 1946. Shortly after World War II ended, President [[Harry S. Truman]] directed Army and Navy officials to secure a site for testing nuclear weapons on American warships. While the Army had seen the results of a land-based explosion, the Navy wanted to know the effect of a nuclear weapon on ships. They wanted to determine whether ships could be spaced at sea and in ports in a way that would make nuclear weapons ineffective against vessels.<ref name=newsweek>{{cite web|title=Bikini|url=http://www.bikiniatoll.com/Newsweek1946.html|date=1 July 1946|publisher=Newsweek|accessdate=13 August 2013|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131016003324/http://www.bikiniatoll.com/Newsweek1946.html|archivedate=16 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nBikini was distant from both regular sea and air traffic, making it an ideal location.

The [[Operation Crossroads#Test Baker|''Baker'' test's]] [[radioactive contamination]] of all the target ships was the first case of immediate, concentrated [[radioactive fallout]] from a nuclear explosion.

A team of U.S. investigators concluded in late 1947 that the islanders must be moved immediately. Press from around the world harshly criticized the U.S. Navy for ignoring the people. [[Harold L. Ickes|Harold Ickes]], a syndicated columnist, wrote \"The natives are actually and literally starving to death.\"<ref name=Niedenthal/>\n\n==== Move to Kili Island ====\n{{details|Kili Island}}\n[[File:Kili Island - NASA Astronaut Photography.png|thumb|Kili Island is one of the smallest islands in the Marshall Islands.]]\nIn January 1948, Dr. Leonard Mason, an anthropologist from the University of Hawaii, visited Rongerik Atoll and was horrified at what he found. One resident of Rongerik commented,<ref name=guyer/>\n\n{{quote|We'd get a few fish, then the entire community would have to share this meager amount... The fish were not fit to eat there. They were poisonous because of what they ate on the reef. We got sick from them, like when your arms and legs fall asleep and you can't feel anything. We'd get up in the morning to go to our canoes and fall over because we were so ill... Then we started asking these men from America [to] bring us food... We were dying, but they didn't listen to us.}}\n\nMason requested that food be brought to the islanders on Rongerik immediately along with a medical officer. The Navy then selected [[Ujelang Atoll]] for their temporary home and some young men from the Bikini Atoll population went ahead to begin constructing living accommodations. But U.S. Trust Authorities changed their mind. They decided to use [[Enewetak Atoll]] as a second nuclear weapons test site and relocated that atoll's residents to Ujelang Atoll instead and to the homes built for the Bikini Islanders.<ref name=Niedenthal/>\n\nIn March 1948, 184 malnourished Bikini islanders were relocated again to [[Kwajalein Atoll]]. They were given tents on a strip of grass alongside the airport runway to live in.<ref name=kattenburg/> In June 1948, the Bikini residents chose [[Kili Island]] as a long-term home.<ref name=Niedenthal/> The extremely small, {{convert|81|ha}} ({{convert|.93|sqkm}}) island was uninhabited and wasn't ruled by a paramount ''iroij'', or king due to its size. It also lacks a coral reef. In June, the Bikini community chose two dozen men to accompany eight [[Seabee]]s to Kili to begin construction of a village. In November 1948, the residents, now totaling 184 individuals, moved to Kili Island,<ref name=Niedenthal/> at {{convert|0.93|km2|sqmi}}, one of the smallest islands in the Marshall Island chain. They soon learned they could no longer fish the way they had on Bikini Atoll. Kili lacked the calm, protected, lagoon.<ref name=kattenburg/> Living on Kili Island effectively destroyed their culture that had been based on fishing and island-hopping canoe voyages to various islets around the Bikini Atoll. Kili did not provide enough food for the transplanted residents.<ref name=guyer/>\n\n==== Failed resettlement ====\n\nAfter their relocation to Kili, the Bikini residents continued to suffer from inadequate food supplies. Kili is a small island without a lagoon, and most of the year it is exposed to {{convert|10|to|20|foot|abbr=off}} waves that make fishing and putting canoes out difficult. Starvation ensued. In 1949, the Trust Territory administration donated a {{convert|40|ft|adj=on}} ship for transporting copra between Kili and [[Jaluit Atoll]], but the ship was wrecked in heavy surf while delivering [[copra]] and other fruit.<ref name=Niedenthal/>\nThe U.S. Trust Authorities airdropped food onto Kili. The residents were forced to rely on imported USDA rice and canned goods and had to buy food with their supplemental income.<ref name=Niedenthal/>\n\nDuring 1955 and 1956, ships dispatched by the U.S. Trust Territory continually experienced problems unloading food because of the rough seas around the island, leading to additional food shortages. The people once again suffered from starvation and the shortages increased in 1956. The U.S. suggested that some of the Bikini Islanders move to Jaluit where food was more readily available. A few people moved.<ref name=kattenburg/>\n\nThe United States opened a satellite community for the families on public land on [[Jaluit Atoll]], {{convert|30|mi}} north. Three families moved there to produce [[copra]] for sale and other families rotated living there later on.<ref name=Niedenthal/> Their homes on both Kili and Jaluit were struck by typhoons during 1957 and 1958, sinking their supply ship and damaging crops.\n\n==== Return to Bikini Island ====\n\nIn June 1968, based on scientific advice that the radiation levels were sufficiently reduced, President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] promised the 540 Bikini Atoll family members living on Kili and other islands that they would be able to return to their home. The Atomic Energy Commission cleared radioactive debris from the island, and the U.S. Trust Territory was in charge of rebuilding structures and replanting crops on the atoll. But shortly afterward the Trust Territory ended regular air flights between Kwajalein Atoll and Bikini Atoll which seriously impeded progress. Coconut trees were finally replanted in 1972, but the AEC learned that the [[coconut crab]]s retained high levels of radioactivity and could not be eaten. The Bikini Council voted to delay a return to the island as a result.<ref name=Niedenthal/>\n\nThree extended families, eventually totaling about 100 people, moved back to their home island in 1972 despite the risk. But 10 years later, a team of French scientists performed additional tests on the island and its inhabitants. They found some wells were too radioactive for use and determined that the pandanus and breadfruit were also dangerous for human consumption. Urine samples from the islanders on Bikini Atoll showed low levels of [[plutonium-239]] and [[plutonium-240]]. As a result, the Bikini community filed a federal lawsuit seeking a complete scientific survey of Bikini and the northern Marshall Islands. Inter-departmental squabbling over responsibility for the costs delayed the work for three years.<ref name=Niedenthal/> Then in May 1977 scientists found dangerously high levels of [[strontium-90]] in the well water exceeding the U.S. maximum allowed limits.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bikiniatoll.com/history.html |title=A Short History of the People of Bikini Atoll |accessdate=27 June 2007 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070625154117/http://www.bikiniatoll.com/history.html| archivedate= 25 June 2007 | url-status= live}}</ref> In June, the Department of Energy stated that \"All living patterns involving Bikini Island exceed Federal [radiation] guidelines for thirty year population doses.\" Later that year scientists discovered an 11-fold increase in the [[caesium-137]] body burdens in all of the people living on the atoll.<ref name=Niedenthal/> In May 1978 officials from the U.S. Department of the Interior described the 75% increase in radioactive caesium-137 found as \"incredible\".<ref name=divingworldhistory/>\n\nWomen were experiencing [[miscarriage]]s, [[stillbirth]]s, and genetic abnormalities in their children.<ref name=bik12>{{cite web |url=http://www.mauinews.com/page/content.detail/id/558769/Survivors-of-nuke-testing-seek-justice.html?nav=10 |title=Survivors of nuke testing seek justice: Marshall Islanders on Maui rally to share nation's story |first=Chris |last=Hamilton |date=4 March 2012 |work=Maui News |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120523212532/http://www.mauinews.com/page/content.detail/id/558769/Survivors-of-nuke-testing-seek-justice.html?nav=10 |archivedate=23 May 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web  | url = http://www.ratical.org/radiation/NAvictims.html | title = Victims of the Nuclear Age |accessdate=22 July 2007 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070809213904/http://www.ratical.org/radiation/NAvictims.html |archivedate=9 August 2007 |url-status= live}}</ref>{{better source|date=January 2014}} Researchers learned that the coral soil behaved differently from mainland soil because it contains very little potassium.

In 1987, a few Bikini elders traveled to Eneu island to reestablish old property lines. Construction crews began building a hotel, docks, and roads on Bikini, and installed generators, desalinators, and power lines. A packed coral and sand runway still exists on Eneu Island. The Bikini Atoll Divers was established to provide income. But in 1995, council learned that the US Environmental Protection Agency standard required reducing radiation levels to 15 millirems, substantially less than the US Department of Energy standard of 100 millirems. This discovery significantly increased the potential cost of cleanup and stalled the effort.<ref name=gwynne/>\n\n=== Relocation to Kili Island ===\n\nAs a result of the military use of the island and the failed resettlement, the islands are littered with abandoned concrete bunkers and tons of heavy equipment, vehicles, supplies, machines, and buildings.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.48north.com/jul_2006/bikini.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061105113544/http://www.48north.com/jul_2006/bikini.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=2006-11-05 |title=Cruising Bikini Atoll 60 Years after the bomb |accessdate=13 August 2013 |date=July 2006 }}</ref> In September 1978, Trust Territory officials finally arrived to relocate the residents.

Toward the end of the eighth grade, students must pass a standardized test to gain admission to attend public high school in [[Jaluit]] or [[Majuro]].\n\nBeginning in 2011 the resettled residents of Kili Island began to experience periods of ocean flooding during [[king tide]]. The highest point of Kili Island is only {{convert|3|m|ft}} above sea level.

The atoll's inhabitants were relocated in 1946, after which the islands and lagoon were the site of 23 [[Nuclear testing at Bikini Atoll|nuclear tests]] by the United States until 1958. \n\nThe atoll is at the northern end of the [[Ralik Chain]], approximately {{convert|850|km|mi}} northwest of the capital [[Majuro]]. Three families were resettled on Bikini island in 1970, totaling about 100 residents. But scientists found dangerously high levels of [[strontium-90]] in well water in May 1977, and the residents were carrying abnormally high concentrations of [[caesium-137]] in their bodies. They were evacuated in 1980. The atoll is occasionally visited today by divers and a few scientists, and is occupied by a handful of caretakers.\n\n== Etymology ==\n\nThe island's English name is derived from the German colonial name ''Bikini'' given to the atoll when it was part of [[German New Guinea]]. The German name is transliterated from the [[Marshallese language|Marshallese]] name for the island, {{lang|mh|Pikinni}}, ({{IPAc-mh|pikinniy}}) \"''Pik''\" meaning \"surface\" and \"''Ni''\" meaning \"coconut\", or ''surface of coconuts''.<ref name=turssel2/>\n\n== Culture ==\n{{main article|Marshallese culture}}\n[[File:Liijabor wearing nieded 1918.jpg|thumb|A woman named Liijabor from Likiep Island, [[Likiep Atoll]] in the [[Marshall Islands]], wears a traditional ''nieded'' or [[Ta'ovala|clothing mat]], {{circa}} 1918]]\n\nBikini islanders' traditional lifestyle was based on cultivating plants and eating shellfish and fish.

The islanders worked the [[copra]] plantations under the watchful eye of the Japanese, who took a portion of the sales. Chiefs could retain as much as $20,000 per year, and the remainder was distributed to the workers.

It has caused some Bikini islanders to become economically dependent on the payments from the trust fund. This dependency has eroded individuals' interest in traditional economic pursuits like taro and copra production. The move also altered traditional patterns of social alliance and political organization. On Bikini, rights to land and land ownership were the major factor in social and political organization and leadership. After relocation and settlement on Kili, a dual system of land tenure evolved. Disbursements from the trust fund were based in part to land ownership on Bikini and based on current land tenure on Kili.<ref name=culture/>\n\nBefore the residents were relocated, they were led by a local chief and under the nominal control of the Paramount Chief of the Marshall Islands.

The testing began with the [[Operation Crossroads]] series in July 1946. The residents initially accepted resettlement voluntarily to [[Rongerik Atoll]], believing that they would be able to return home within a short time. However, Rongerik could not produce enough food, and the islanders starved.

It resulted in Spain's losing many of its remaining colonies; Cuba became nominally independent while the United States took possession of Puerto Rico and Spain's Pacific colonies of the Philippines and Guam. This left Spain with the remainder of the Spanish East Indies in the Pacific, about 6000 islands that were tiny and sparsely populated. After the loss of the administrative center of Manila, the minor islands became ungovernable and, after the entire loss of two Spanish fleets in 1898, indefensible.\n\nThe Spanish government sold the islands to Germany.<ref name=nitijela/> The treaty was signed on 12 February 1899, by Spanish Prime Minister Francisco Silvela, and transferred the Caroline Islands, the Mariana Islands, Palau and other possessions to Germany.

The Japanese administered the island under the [[South Pacific Mandate]], but mostly left local affairs in the hands of traditional local leaders until the start of [[World War II]]. At the outset of the war, the Marshall Islands suddenly became a strategic outpost for the Japanese.

Kili lacked the calm, protected, lagoon.<ref name=kattenburg/> Living on Kili Island effectively destroyed their culture that had been based on fishing and island-hopping canoe voyages to various islets around the Bikini Atoll. Kili did not provide enough food for the transplanted residents.<ref name=guyer/>\n\n==== Failed resettlement ====\n\nAfter their relocation to Kili, the Bikini residents continued to suffer from inadequate food supplies. Kili is a small island without a lagoon, and most of the year it is exposed to {{convert|10|to|20|foot|abbr=off}} waves that make fishing and putting canoes out difficult. Starvation ensued. In 1949, the Trust Territory administration donated a {{convert|40|ft|adj=on}} ship for transporting copra between Kili and [[Jaluit Atoll]], but the ship was wrecked in heavy surf while delivering [[copra]] and other fruit.<ref name=Niedenthal/>\nThe U.S. Trust Authorities airdropped food onto Kili. The residents were forced to rely on imported USDA rice and canned goods and had to buy food with their supplemental income.<ref name=Niedenthal/>\n\nDuring 1955 and 1956, ships dispatched by the U.S. Trust Territory continually experienced problems unloading food because of the rough seas around the island, leading to additional food shortages. The people once again suffered from starvation and the shortages increased in 1956. The U.S. suggested that some of the Bikini Islanders move to Jaluit where food was more readily available. A few people moved.<ref name=kattenburg/>\n\nThe United States opened a satellite community for the families on public land on [[Jaluit Atoll]], {{convert|30|mi}} north. Three families moved there to produce [[copra]] for sale and other families rotated living there later on.<ref name=Niedenthal/> Their homes on both Kili and Jaluit were struck by typhoons during 1957 and 1958, sinking their supply ship and damaging crops.\n\n==== Return to Bikini Island ====\n\nIn June 1968, based on scientific advice that the radiation levels were sufficiently reduced, President [[Lyndon B. Johnson]] promised the 540 Bikini Atoll family members living on Kili and other islands that they would be able to return to their home. The Atomic Energy Commission cleared radioactive debris from the island, and the U.S. Trust Territory was in charge of rebuilding structures and replanting crops on the atoll. But shortly afterward the Trust Territory ended regular air flights between Kwajalein Atoll and Bikini Atoll which seriously impeded progress. Coconut trees were finally replanted in 1972, but the AEC learned that the [[coconut crab]]s retained high levels of radioactivity and could not be eaten. The Bikini Council voted to delay a return to the island as a result.<ref name=Niedenthal/>\n\nThree extended families, eventually totaling about 100 people, moved back to their home island in 1972 despite the risk. But 10 years later, a team of French scientists performed additional tests on the island and its inhabitants. They found some wells were too radioactive for use and determined that the pandanus and breadfruit were also dangerous for human consumption. Urine samples from the islanders on Bikini Atoll showed low levels of [[plutonium-239]] and [[plutonium-240]]. As a result, the Bikini community filed a federal lawsuit seeking a complete scientific survey of Bikini and the northern Marshall Islands. Inter-departmental squabbling over responsibility for the costs delayed the work for three years.<ref name=Niedenthal/> Then in May 1977 scientists found dangerously high levels of [[strontium-90]] in the well water exceeding the U.S. maximum allowed limits.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.bikiniatoll.com/history.html |title=A Short History of the People of Bikini Atoll |accessdate=27 June 2007 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070625154117/http://www.bikiniatoll.com/history.html| archivedate= 25 June 2007 | url-status= live}}</ref> In June, the Department of Energy stated that \"All living patterns involving Bikini Island exceed Federal [radiation] guidelines for thirty year population doses.\" Later that year scientists discovered an 11-fold increase in the [[caesium-137]] body burdens in all of the people living on the atoll.<ref name=Niedenthal/> In May 1978 officials from the U.S. Department of the Interior described the 75% increase in radioactive caesium-137 found as \"incredible\".<ref name=divingworldhistory/>\n\nWomen were experiencing [[miscarriage]]s, [[stillbirth]]s, and genetic abnormalities in their children.<ref name=bik12>{{cite web |url=http://www.mauinews.com/page/content.detail/id/558769/Survivors-of-nuke-testing-seek-justice.html?nav=10 |title=Survivors of nuke testing seek justice: Marshall Islanders on Maui rally to share nation's story |first=Chris |last=Hamilton |date=4 March 2012 |work=Maui News |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120523212532/http://www.mauinews.com/page/content.detail/id/558769/Survivors-of-nuke-testing-seek-justice.html?nav=10 |archivedate=23 May 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web  | url = http://www.ratical.org/radiation/NAvictims.html | title = Victims of the Nuclear Age |accessdate=22 July 2007 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070809213904/http://www.ratical.org/radiation/NAvictims.html |archivedate=9 August 2007 |url-status= live}}</ref>{{better source|date=January 2014}} Researchers learned that the coral soil behaved differently from mainland soil because it contains very little potassium.

The islanders who unknowingly consumed contaminated coconut milk were found to have abnormally high concentrations of caesium in their bodies.

In 1987, a few Bikini elders traveled to Eneu island to reestablish old property lines. Construction crews began building a hotel, docks, and roads on Bikini, and installed generators, desalinators, and power lines. A packed coral and sand runway still exists on Eneu Island. The Bikini Atoll Divers was established to provide income. But in 1995, council learned that the US Environmental Protection Agency standard required reducing radiation levels to 15 millirems, substantially less than the US Department of Energy standard of 100 millirems. This discovery significantly increased the potential cost of cleanup and stalled the effort.<ref name=gwynne/>\n\n=== Relocation to Kili Island ===\n\nAs a result of the military use of the island and the failed resettlement, the islands are littered with abandoned concrete bunkers and tons of heavy equipment, vehicles, supplies, machines, and buildings.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.48north.com/jul_2006/bikini.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061105113544/http://www.48north.com/jul_2006/bikini.htm |url-status=dead |archive-date=2006-11-05 |title=Cruising Bikini Atoll 60 Years after the bomb |accessdate=13 August 2013 |date=July 2006 }}</ref> In September 1978, Trust Territory officials finally arrived to relocate the residents.

They must rely on contributions from a settlement trust fund to supplement what they produce locally. Each family receives 1-2 boxes of frozen chicken, 2-4 {{convert|23|kg}} bags of flour, and 2-4 bags of rice 2-3 times per year. The islanders operate several small stores out of their homes to supply nonperishable food items like salt, Tabasco, candy, and canned items. A generator provides electricity.\n\nChildren attend elementary school on Kili through eighth grade. Toward the end of the eighth grade, students must pass a standardized test to gain admission to attend public high school in [[Jaluit]] or [[Majuro]].\n\nBeginning in 2011 the resettled residents of Kili Island began to experience periods of ocean flooding during [[king tide]]. The highest point of Kili Island is only {{convert|3|m|ft}} above sea level. Ocean waves have covered portions of the island at least five times from 2011 to 2015, contaminating the wells on the island. The runway servicing the island is unusable during and after rains and ocean flooding because it becomes extremely muddy. In August 2015, the Bikini Council passed a resolution requesting assistance from US government to modify terms of the Resettlement Trust Fund for the People of Bikini to be used to relocate the population once again, this time outside of the Marshall Islands.<ref name=gwynne/><ref name=gjohnson>{{cite web |title=Exiled by nuclear testing, rising seas force Bikinians to flee again |date=8 August 2015 |first=Giff |last=Johnson |url=http://www.radionz.co.nz/international/pacific-news/280811/rising-seas-force-bikinians-to-flee-again |publisher=RNZI |accessdate=28 April 2016 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160427193906/http://www.radionz.co.nz/international/pacific-news/280811/rising-seas-force-bikinians-to-flee-again |archivedate=27 April 2016 |df=dmy-all }}</ref>\n\n== Trust funds and failed claims ==\n\nIn 1975, when the islanders who had returned to Bikini Atoll learned that it wasn't safe, they sued the United States for the first time, demanding a radiological study of the northern islands.<ref>{{cite web|title=Despite High Court Denial, Battle Over Bikini Atoll Bombing Endures|url=http://bikiniatoll.wordpress.com/2010/04/26/despite-high-court-denial-battle-over-bikini-atoll-bombing-endures/|publisher=Bikini Island Local Government|accessdate=20 August 2013|date=26 April 2010|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131024061225/http://bikiniatoll.wordpress.com/2010/04/26/despite-high-court-denial-battle-over-bikini-atoll-bombing-endures/|archivedate=24 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}</ref>\n\nIn 1975, the United States set up ''The Hawaiian Trust Fund for the People of Bikini'', totaling $3 million.

The United States Supreme Court turned down the islanders' appeal of the United States Court of Appeals decision that refused to compel the government to fund their claim.

It is located in the [[Republika Srpska]] entity and is the provincial center of [[Semberija]], a geographic region in the country's northeast. As of 2013, it has a population of 107,715 inhabitants.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bhas.ba/obavjestenja/Preliminarni_rezultati_bos.pdf|format=PDF|title=PRELIMINARY RESULTS of the 2013 Census of Population, Households and Dwellings in Bosnia and Herzegovina|website=Bhas.ba|accessdate=3 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n[[Semberija]] is a flat region which is bound by the rivers [[Sava]], [[Drina River|Drina]] and the Majevica mountains. The entire Semberija area is typically an agricultural region which has fertile land and suitable weather conditions.\n\nSemberija has the most developed agricultural area in Republika Srpska. The focus of the production is on wheat and corns, vegetables, cabbage, paprika, tomato and water-melon. Also, cattle-breeding (fattening of cows and pigs) and growing fruits.\n\n==History==\n{{refimprove section|date=December 2015}}\n===Prehistory and Antiquity===\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2015}}\nThe earliest confirmed traces of human life in the area of today's Bijeljina date from the [[New Stone Age]] (5000\u20133000&nbsp;BC). Most of the traces from prehistoric periods were found in the villages Ostoji\u0107evo, Batkovi\u0107, Glavi\u010dice, Dvorovi, Koj\u010dinovac, Patkova\u010da and Trije\u0161nica. Characteristics of pottery, tools and weapons emphatically confirm cultural connections of indigenous inhabitants of Semberija with the eneolithic and Bronze Age cultures \u2013 Vu\u010dedol, Kostolac and [[Baden culture]].\n\n===Old Slavs and Middle Ages===\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2015}}\nThe oldest archeological site of this period is located on both sides of channel Bistrik, between the villages Batkovi\u0107 and Ostoji\u0107evo and it consists of four smaller sites which date from the period of the 7th to the 12th century. At Jazbina and Ora\u0161\u010di\u0107 remains were found of a settlement with half-buried huts, but the most significant discovery was a complex of metallurgical workshop at the site \u010celopek where iron was melted in the 8th century and where iron tools were manufactured. At this time the village Bistrik was called Bistrica and it was the center of the parish, which covered the entire territory of present-day city of Bijeljina. Although the name Bijeljina was first mentioned in 1446, this name was in use only after 1918. During Austro-Hungarian period, the town had the name Bjelina and, before that, Belina or Bilina.\n[[File:Trg Kralju Petru Karadjordjevicu I.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Peter I of Serbia|Petar Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107 I]] monument. He was the King of Serbia from 1903\u201318.]]\n\n===Modern history===\nIn 1838, the first confessional elementary school was opened. A modern school building was built in 1902. In this school [[Jovan Du\u010di\u0107]], famous Herzegovinian Serb poet, writer and diplomat, worked between 1893\u201395.<ref>[http://www.oaza.rs/bijeljina/skolstvo-s.htm Bijeljina na Internetu - skolstvo], Oaza.rs; accessed 9 July 2015.{{in lang|sr}}</ref>\n\nIn front of City Hall is a statue of King [[Peter I of Serbia]], who ruled the [[Kingdom of Serbia]] between 1903 and 1918. During the [[Second World War]], the [[Usta\u0161a]] removed it. After [[World War II]], the communist government refused to return the monument. The first non-communist local government returned the monument in the early 1990s.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\n====Bosnian War====\n{{main|Bijeljina massacre}}\n{{refimprove section|date=December 2015}}\nIn September 1991, [[Bosnian Serbs]] proclaimed a [[Serbian Autonomous Oblast]] with Bijeljina as its capital. In March 1992, the [[Bosnia and Herzegovina independence referendum, 1992|Bosnian referendum on independence]] was passed with overwhelming support from Bosniaks and [[Bosnian Croats]]. Local Bosniak [[Patriotic League (Bosnia and Herzegovina)|Patriotic League]] had been established in response to the Bosnian Serb proclamation and started the clashes. On 1\u20132 April, the SDG and the JNA overtook Bijeljina with little resistance; A [[Bijeljina massacre|massacre]] was carried out and involved the killing of between 48 and 78 civilians by [[Serbs|Serb]] [[paramilitary]] groups. The majority of those killed were [[Bosniaks]] (or Bosnian Muslims). The dead included members of other ethnicities, such as Serbs deemed unloyal by the local authorities. The killing was committed by a local paramilitary group known as Mirko's [[Chetniks]] and by the [[Serb Volunteer Guard]] (SDG, also known as Arkan's Tigers), a [[Republic of Serbia (1990-2006)|Serbia]]-based [[paramilitary]] group under the command of the [[Yugoslav People's Army]] (JNA).\n\nThe village of [[Batkovi\u0107]] in the municipality of Bijeljina was the site of the [[Batkovi\u0107 concentration camp]], believed to be the first concentration camp in operation during the [[Bosnian War]]. It was run by Serbs from 1 April 1992 until late January 1996.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oslobodjenje.ba/vijesti/bih/prezivjeli-logoras-iz-batkovica-i-danas-sanjam-da-mi-neko-ulazi-u-kucu-i-stavlja-pusku-na-celo|title=Pre\u017eivjeli logora\u0161 iz Batkovi\u0107a: I danas sanjam da mi neko ulazi u ku\u0107u i stavlja pu\u0161ku na \u010delo|publisher=Oslobo\u0111enje|date=1 April 2015|accessdate=18 April 2015}}</ref> The prisoners were predominantly ethnic [[Bosniaks]], who were tortured, sexually assaulted, and killed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sense-agency.com/icty/friendships-flourished-in-batkovic-prison-camp.29.html?news_id=14811|title=FRIENDSHIPS FLOURISHED IN BATKOVIC PRISON CAMP|publisher=Sense Agency|date=3 April 2013|accessdate=18 April 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1PP987m08R8C&pg=PA135&dq=Batkovi%C4%87+Detention+Camp&hl=en&sa=X&ei=0bMwVdqeNezfsAT7roGgCA&ved=0CDMQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=Batkovi%C4%87%20Detention%20Camp&f=false|title=''The Serbian Project and Its Adversaries: A Strategy of War Crimes''|publisher=Google Books|year=2003|accessdate=18 April 2015}}</ref> A \"State Commission for the Free transfer of the Civilian Population\" or \"Commission for the Exchange of Population\" was created and headed by Vojkan \u0110urkovi\u0107, a [[Major (military)|Major]] in the SDG, and included Mauzer's Panthers. Its purpose was to completely expel all non-Serbs from Bijeljina.\n\n====Post-war period====\nPost-war development of Bijeljina is experienced in the late 1990s and the first decade of the 21st century.

It is located in the [[Republika Srpska]] entity and is the provincial center of [[Semberija]], a geographic region in the country's northeast. As of 2013, it has a population of 107,715 inhabitants.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bhas.ba/obavjestenja/Preliminarni_rezultati_bos.pdf|format=PDF|title=PRELIMINARY RESULTS of the 2013 Census of Population, Households and Dwellings in Bosnia and Herzegovina|website=Bhas.ba|accessdate=3 January 2018}}</ref>\n\n==Geography==\n[[Semberija]] is a flat region which is bound by the rivers [[Sava]], [[Drina River|Drina]] and the Majevica mountains. The entire Semberija area is typically an agricultural region which has fertile land and suitable weather conditions.\n\nSemberija has the most developed agricultural area in Republika Srpska. The focus of the production is on wheat and corns, vegetables, cabbage, paprika, tomato and water-melon. Also, cattle-breeding (fattening of cows and pigs) and growing fruits.\n\n==History==\n{{refimprove section|date=December 2015}}\n===Prehistory and Antiquity===\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2015}}\nThe earliest confirmed traces of human life in the area of today's Bijeljina date from the [[New Stone Age]] (5000\u20133000&nbsp;BC). Most of the traces from prehistoric periods were found in the villages Ostoji\u0107evo, Batkovi\u0107, Glavi\u010dice, Dvorovi, Koj\u010dinovac, Patkova\u010da and Trije\u0161nica. Characteristics of pottery, tools and weapons emphatically confirm cultural connections of indigenous inhabitants of Semberija with the eneolithic and Bronze Age cultures \u2013 Vu\u010dedol, Kostolac and [[Baden culture]].\n\n===Old Slavs and Middle Ages===\n{{unreferenced section|date=July 2015}}\nThe oldest archeological site of this period is located on both sides of channel Bistrik, between the villages Batkovi\u0107 and Ostoji\u0107evo and it consists of four smaller sites which date from the period of the 7th to the 12th century. At Jazbina and Ora\u0161\u010di\u0107 remains were found of a settlement with half-buried huts, but the most significant discovery was a complex of metallurgical workshop at the site \u010celopek where iron was melted in the 8th century and where iron tools were manufactured. At this time the village Bistrik was called Bistrica and it was the center of the parish, which covered the entire territory of present-day city of Bijeljina. Although the name Bijeljina was first mentioned in 1446, this name was in use only after 1918. During Austro-Hungarian period, the town had the name Bjelina and, before that, Belina or Bilina.\n[[File:Trg Kralju Petru Karadjordjevicu I.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Peter I of Serbia|Petar Kara\u0111or\u0111evi\u0107 I]] monument.

The first non-communist local government returned the monument in the early 1990s.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}\n\n====Bosnian War====\n{{main|Bijeljina massacre}}\n{{refimprove section|date=December 2015}}\nIn September 1991, [[Bosnian Serbs]] proclaimed a [[Serbian Autonomous Oblast]] with Bijeljina as its capital. In March 1992, the [[Bosnia and Herzegovina independence referendum, 1992|Bosnian referendum on independence]] was passed with overwhelming support from Bosniaks and [[Bosnian Croats]]. Local Bosniak [[Patriotic League (Bosnia and Herzegovina)|Patriotic League]] had been established in response to the Bosnian Serb proclamation and started the clashes. On 1\u20132 April, the SDG and the JNA overtook Bijeljina with little resistance; A [[Bijeljina massacre|massacre]] was carried out and involved the killing of between 48 and 78 civilians by [[Serbs|Serb]] [[paramilitary]] groups. The majority of those killed were [[Bosniaks]] (or Bosnian Muslims). The dead included members of other ethnicities, such as Serbs deemed unloyal by the local authorities. The killing was committed by a local paramilitary group known as Mirko's [[Chetniks]] and by the [[Serb Volunteer Guard]] (SDG, also known as Arkan's Tigers), a [[Republic of Serbia (1990-2006)|Serbia]]-based [[paramilitary]] group under the command of the [[Yugoslav People's Army]] (JNA).\n\nThe village of [[Batkovi\u0107]] in the municipality of Bijeljina was the site of the [[Batkovi\u0107 concentration camp]], believed to be the first concentration camp in operation during the [[Bosnian War]]. It was run by Serbs from 1 April 1992 until late January 1996.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oslobodjenje.ba/vijesti/bih/prezivjeli-logoras-iz-batkovica-i-danas-sanjam-da-mi-neko-ulazi-u-kucu-i-stavlja-pusku-na-celo|title=Pre\u017eivjeli logora\u0161 iz Batkovi\u0107a: I danas sanjam da mi neko ulazi u ku\u0107u i stavlja pu\u0161ku na \u010delo|publisher=Oslobo\u0111enje|date=1 April 2015|accessdate=18 April 2015}}</ref> The prisoners were predominantly ethnic [[Bosniaks]], who were tortured, sexually assaulted, and killed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sense-agency.com/icty/friendships-flourished-in-batkovic-prison-camp.29.html?news_id=14811|title=FRIENDSHIPS FLOURISHED IN BATKOVIC PRISON CAMP|publisher=Sense Agency|date=3 April 2013|accessdate=18 April 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1PP987m08R8C&pg=PA135&dq=Batkovi%C4%87+Detention+Camp&hl=en&sa=X&ei=0bMwVdqeNezfsAT7roGgCA&ved=0CDMQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&q=Batkovi%C4%87%20Detention%20Camp&f=false|title=''The Serbian Project and Its Adversaries: A Strategy of War Crimes''|publisher=Google Books|year=2003|accessdate=18 April 2015}}</ref> A \"State Commission for the Free transfer of the Civilian Population\" or \"Commission for the Exchange of Population\" was created and headed by Vojkan \u0110urkovi\u0107, a [[Major (military)|Major]] in the SDG, and included Mauzer's Panthers.

[[Vajji]] covered the modern [[North Bihar]], [[Magadha]] covered South-western Bihar while [[Anga]] covered South-eastern Bihar. Many of the sixteen kingdoms had coalesced to four major ones by 500/400 BCE, that is by the time of [[Siddhartha Gautama]]. These four were Vatsa, Avanti, Kosala and Magadha.<ref>{{cite book | author= Krishna Reddy | title = Indian History | year = 2003 | publisher = Tata McGraw Hill | location = New Delhi | isbn = 0-07-048369-8 | pages = A107 }}</ref> In 537 BCE, Siddhartha Gautama attained the state of \"[[Enlightenment (spiritual)|enlightenment]]\" in [[Bodh Gaya]], Bihar.

They have profoundly influenced practices that Hinduism and Indian spiritual orders are associated with namely, [[vegetarianism]], prohibition of animal slaughter and [[ahimsa]] (non-violence).\n\nWhile the geographic impact of Jainism was limited to India, Buddhist nuns and monks eventually spread the teachings of [[Buddha]] to [[Central Asia]], [[East Asia]], [[Tibet]], [[Sri Lanka]] and South East Asia. [[Nalanda University]] and [[Vikramshila University]] one of the oldest residential universities were established in Bihar during this period.\n\nAccording to both Buddhist texts and Jain texts, one of Pradyota tradition was that king's son would kill his father to become the successor. During this time, it is reported that there was high crimes in Magadha. The people rose up and elected [[Shishunaga]] to become the new king, who destroyed the power of the Pradyotas and created the [[Shishunaga dynasty]].\n\n== The Magadha Empire ==\n{{Main|Magadha}}\n{{See also|Shishunaga dynasty|Nanda Dynasty|Mauryan dynasty|Shunga dynasty|Kanva dynasty}}\n{{Further|Bimbisara|Ajatashatru|Mahapadma Nanda|Chandragupta Maurya|Bindusara|Ashoka|Samprati|Pushyamitra Shunga}}\n{{Further|Kalinga War|Rajgriha|Pataliputra|Edicts of Ashoka|Ashokavadana|Arthashastra|Emblem of India}}\n{{Further|Ambapali|Chanakya|Brhadrata}}\n\n[[Shishunaga]] (also called King [[Sisunaka]]) was the founder of a dynasty collectively called the [[Shishunaga dynasty]]. He established the [[Shishunaga dynasty|Magadha empire]] (in 684 BCE). Due in part to this bloody dynastic feuding, it is thought that a civil revolt led to the emergence of the Shishunaga dynasty. This empire, with its original capital in [[Rajgir|Rajgriha]], later shifted to [[Pataliputra]] (both currently in the Indian state of Bihar). The Shishunaga dynasty was one of the largest empires of the [[Indian subcontinent]].\n\nThe Hariyanka dynasty king [[Bimbisara]] was responsible for expanding the boundaries of his kingdom through matrimonial alliances and conquest. The land of [[Kosala]] fell to Magadha in this way. Estimates place the territory ruled by this early dynasty at 300 leagues in diameter, and encompassing 80,000 small settlements. [[Bimbisara]] is contemporary with the Buddha, and is recorded as a lay disciple. Bimbisara (543\u2013493 BCE) was imprisoned and killed by his own son who became his successor, [[Ajatashatru]] (491\u2013461 BCE), under whose rule, the dynasty reached its largest extent.\n\n{|  class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float:right; margin:0 0 1em 1em;\"\n| style=\"background:#f8eaba; text-align:center;\"|\n<div class=\"center\">\n; Magadha\n</div>\n|-\n|\n<gallery>\nFile:Bimbisarajail.jpg|''[[Bimbisara]]'s jail'', where King Bimbisara was imprisoned by his son [[Ajatashatru]], in [[Rajgir]]\nFile:Ajatashatru stupa at Rajgir.jpg|[[Ajatashatru]]'s [[stupa]] in [[Rajgir]], where his ashes were interred.\n</gallery>\n|-\n|\n<gallery>\nFile:Ashoka pillar at Vaishali, Bihar, India.jpg|[[Vaishali (ancient city)|Vaishali]] was the [[Capital (political)|capital]] of [[Vajji|Vajjian Confederacy]], believed to be the world's earliest [[republic]].<ref name=\"eb-vaisali\" /><ref>{{cite book|title=India: Lonely planet Guide|last=Bindloss|first=Joe|authorlink=|author2=Sarina Singh|year=2007|publisher=[[Lonely Planet]]|isbn= 978-1-74104-308-2|page=556|url=https://books.google.com/?id=T7ZHUhSEleYC&pg=PA556&dq=Vaishali#v=onepage&q=Vaishali|ref= }}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Students' Britannica India, Volumes 1-5|last=Hoiberg|first=Dale|authorlink=|author2=Indu Ramchandani|year=2000|publisher=Popular Prakashan|isbn=0-85229-760-2|page=208|url=https://books.google.com/?id=DPP7O3nb3g0C&pg=PA208&dq=Vaishali#v=onepage&q=Vaishali|ref= }}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=A history of India|last=Kulke|first=Hermann|authorlink=|author2=Dietmar Rothermund|year=2004|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-415-32919-1|page= 57|url=https://books.google.com/?id=TPVq3ykHyH4C&pg=PA57&dq=Vaishali&q=Vaishali|ref= }}</ref>\nFile:Asokanpillar1.jpg|Ashokan Pillar at [[Vaishali (ancient city)|Vaishali]].\n</gallery>\n|}\nLicchavi was an ancient\u2014before the birth of [[Mahavira]]\u2014 [[republic]] in what is now the Bihar state of India.<ref name=\"eb-vaisali\" /> [[Vaishali (ancient city)|Vaishali]] was the capital of Licchavi and the [[Vajji|Vajjian Confederacy]].

Ajatashatru is thought to have ruled from 551 BCE to 519 BCE and moved the capital of the Magadha kingdom from [[Rajagriha]] to [[Pataliputra]]. The [[Mahavamsa]] tells that Udayabhadra eventually succeeded his father, Ajatashatru, and that under him Pataliputra became the largest city in the world. He is thought to have ruled for sixteen years. The kingdom had a particularly bloody succession. Anuruddha eventually succeeded Udaybhadra through assassination, and his son Munda succeeded him in the same fashion, as did his son [[Nagadasaka]].\n\n[[File:Nanda Empire, c.325 BCE.png|thumb|left|200px|The [[Nanda Empire]] at its greatest extent under [[Dhana Nanda]] c. 323 BCE.]]\nThis dynasty lasted until 424 BCE, when it was overthrown by the [[Nanda dynasty]]. This period saw the development in Magadha of two of India's major religions. [[Gautama Buddha]] in the 6th or 5th century BCE was the founder of Buddhism, which later spread to East Asia and [[Southeast Asia]], while [[Mahavira]] revived and propagated the ancient [[\u015arama\u1e47a|sramanic]] religion of Jainism.\n\nThe [[Nanda Dynasty|Nanda dynasty]] was established by an illegitimate son of King [[Mahanandin]] from the previous [[Shishunaga dynasty]]. The [[Nanda dynasty]] ruled Magadha during the 5th and 4th centuries BC. At its greatest extent, the Nanda Empire extended from [[Burma]] in the east, [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Balochistan]] in the west and probably as far south as [[Karnataka]].<ref>Radha Kumud Mookerji, ''Chandragupta Maurya and His Times'', 4th ed.

The Maurya Empire (322\u2013185 BC), ruled by the [[Mauryan dynasty]], was geographically extensive, powerful and a political-military empire in [[history of India|ancient India]]. During this time, most of the subcontinent was united under a single government for the first time. The exceptions were present day [[Tamil Nadu]] and [[Kerala]] (which was a [[Ancient Tamil country|Tamil kingdom]] at that time). The empire had its capital city at [[Pataliputra]] (near modern [[Patna]]). The Mauryan empire under Chandragupta Maurya would not only conquer most of the Indian subcontinent, defeating and conquering the [[satrap]]s left by [[Alexander the Great]], but also push its boundaries into [[Persia]] and Central Asia, conquering the [[Gandhara]] region. Chandragupta Maurya then defeated an invasion led by [[Seleucus I Nicator|Seleucus I]], a Greek general from Alexander's army. Chandragupta Maurya's minister, [[Kautilya Chanakya]], wrote the ''[[Arthashastra]]'', a treatise on economics, politics, foreign affairs, administration, military arts, war and religion.\n\nChandragupta Maurya was succeeded by his son, [[Bindusara]], who expanded the kingdom over most of present-day India, other than the extreme south and east. At its greatest extent, the Empire stretched to the north along the natural boundaries of the [[Himalayas]], and to the east stretching into what is now [[Assam]]. To the west, it reached beyond modern Pakistan, annexing [[Balochistan (region)|Balochistan]] and much of what is now [[Afghanistan]]. The Empire was extended into India's central and southern regions by the emperors Chandragupta and [[Bindusara]], but it excluded the republic of Kalinga.\n\nThe Maurya Empire was inherited by [[Bindusara]]'s son, [[Ashoka The Great|Ashoka]]. Ashoka initially sought to expand his kingdom but in the aftermath of the carnage caused during the invasion of Kalinga, he renounced bloodshed and pursued a policy of non-violence or [[ahimsa]] after converting to Buddhism. Following the conquest of Kalinga, Ashoka ended the military expansion of the empire, and led the empire through more than 40 years of relative peace, harmony and prosperity. Ashoka's response to the Kalinga War is recorded in the [[Edicts of Ashoka]],<ref>The [[Edicts of Ashoka]] are a collection of 33 inscriptions on the [[Pillars of Ashoka]]</ref> one of the oldest preserved historical documents of the Indian subcontinent.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://history-world.org/indian_empire.htm |title=The First Indian Empire |publisher=History-world.org |accessdate=2012-08-15 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120515101903/http://history-world.org/indian_empire.htm |archivedate=15 May 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.buddhistchannel.tv/index.php?id=4,2658,0,0,1,0 |title=Archaeology Gandhara's wonders |accessdate=2008-12-04 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090202223151/http://www.buddhistchannel.tv/index.php?id=4,2658,0,0,1,0 |archivedate=2 February 2009 |df=dmy-all }} [[Edicts of Ashoka]] at Shahbaz Garhi are among the oldest historical \"documents\" found on the subcontinent.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.colostate.edu/~malaiya/ashoka.html |title=KING ASHOKA: His Edicts and His Times |accessdate=2006-11-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131028175927/http://www.cs.colostate.edu/~malaiya/ashoka.html |archivedate=28 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }} [[Edicts of Ashoka]], which comprise the earliest decipherable corpus of written documents from India, have survived throughout the centuries because they are written on rocks and stone pillars.</ref>\n\n[[File:MauryaStatuettes.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Mauryan]] [[Sculpture]]s]]\nAccording to Rock Edicts of Ashoka: {{quote|text=\"Beloved-of-the-Gods [Ashoka], King Priyadarsi, conquered the Kalingas eight years after his coronation. 150000 were deported, 100000 were killed and much more died (from other causes).

Under Ashoka, India was a prosperous and stable empire of great economic and military power whose political influence and trade extended across Asia and into Europe. Chandragupta Maurya's embrace of Jainism increased social and religious renewal and reform across his society, while Ashoka embraced Buddhism. Ashoka sponsored the spreading of Buddhist ideals into Sri Lanka and South-East Asia. The ''[[Lion Capital of Ashoka]]'' at [[Sarnath]], is the [[emblem of India]]. Archaeologically, the period of Mauryan rule in South Asia falls into the era of [[Northern Black Polished Ware]] (NBPW). The ''Arthashastra'', the Edicts of Ashoka and [[Ashokavadana]] are primary sources of written records of the Mauryan times.\n\n[[File:SungaEmpireMap.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The [[Shunga Empire]] at its greatest extent -c. 185 BCE]]\nAshoka was followed for 50 years by a succession of weaker kings. [[Brihadrata]], the last ruler of the Mauryan dynasty, held territories that had shrunk considerably from the time of emperor Ashoka, although he still upheld the Buddhist faith. The [[Shunga dynasty]] was established in 185 BC, about fifty years after Ashoka's death, when the king Brihadratha, the last of the Mauryan rulers, was assassinated by the then commander-in-chief of the [[Mauryan]] [[armed forces]], [[Pushyamitra Shunga]].\n\nPushyamitra Shunga was a Brahmin who then took over the throne and established the Shunga dynasty. [[Decline of Buddhism in India#The Shungas|Buddhist records]] such as the Ashokavadana write that the assassination of Brihadrata and the rise of the Shunga empire led to a wave of [[Decline of Buddhism in India#The Shungas|persecution of Buddhists]],<ref>According to the Ashokavadana.</ref> and a resurgence of [[Hinduism]].

The origins of the Gupta Dynasty are shrouded in obscurity. The Chinese traveller [[Xuanzang]] provides the first evidence of the Gupta kingdom in Magadha. He came to India in 672 CE and heard of '[[Maharaja Sri-Gupta]]' who built a temple for Chinese pilgrims near ''Mrigasikhavana''. [[Ghatotkacha (Gupta Ruler)|Ghatotkacha]] (c. 280&ndash;319) CE, had a son named [[Chandra Gupta I]] (Not to be confused with [[Chandragupta Maurya]] (340\u2013293 BC), founder of the Mauryan Empire). In a breakthrough deal, Chandra Gupta I was married to a woman from Lichchhavi&mdash;the main power in Magadha.\n\n[[Samudragupta]] succeeded Chandra Gupta I in 335, and ruled for about 45 years, until his death in 380. He attacked the kingdoms of Shichchhatra, Padmavati, [[Malwa]]s, the [[Yaudheyas]], the [[Arjunayanas]], the [[Mathura, Uttar Pradesh|Maduras]] and the [[Abhiras]], and merged them in his kingdom. By his death in 380, he had incorporated over twenty kingdoms into his realm, his rule extended from the Himalayas to the river [[Narmada River|Narmada]] and from the [[Brahmaputra river|Brahmaputra]] to the [[Yamuna river|Yamuna]]. He gave himself the titles ''King of Kings'' and ''World Monarch''. He is considered the ''Napoleon of India''. Chandra Gupta I performed ''[[Ashwamedha Yajna]]'' to underline the importance of his conquest.\n\n[[Chandra Gupta II]], the Sun of Power (''[[Vikramaditya]]''), ruled from 380 until 413. Only marginally less successful than his father, Chandra Gupta II expanded his realm westwards, defeating the [[Saka]] [[Western Kshatrapas]] of [[Malwa]], [[Gujarat]] and [[Saurashtra (region)|Saurashtra]] in a campaign lasting until 409. Chandragupta II was succeeded by his son [[Kumara Gupta I|Kumaragupta I]]. Known as the ''Mahendraditya'', he ruled until 455. Towards the end of his reign a tribe in the Narmada valley, the [[Pushyamitras]], rose in power to threaten the empire.\n\n[[Skandagupta]] is generally considered the last of the great rulers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/547260/Skanda-Gupta |title=Skanda Gupta (Gupta ruler) - Britannica Online Encyclopaedia |publisher=Britannica.com |accessdate=2012-08-15 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140307082712/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/547260/Skanda-Gupta |archivedate=7 March 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> He defeated the Pushyamitra threat, but then was faced with invading [[Hephthalite]]s or [[Huna (people)|Huna]], from the northwest.

The [[Gupta period]] is referred to as the Classical age of India by most historians.

The difference between Gupta Empire's and Mauryan Empire's administration was that in the Mauryan administration power was centralised but in the Gupta administration power was more decentralised. The empire was divided into provinces and the provinces were further divided into districts. Villages were the smallest units. The kingdom covered [[Gujarat]], [[North-East India]], south-eastern Pakistan, [[Odisha]], northern [[Madhya Pradesh]] and eastern India with capital at [[Pataliputra]], modern [[Patna]]. All forms of worship were carried out in [[Sanskrit]].\n\nRapid strides were made in [[astronomy]] during this period. [[Aryabhata]] and [[Varahamihira]] were two great astronomers and [[mathematicians]]. Aryabhata stated that the earth moved round the sun and rotated on its own axis. Aryabhata, who is believed to be the first to come up with the concept of [[zero]], postulated the theory that [[heliocentrism|the Earth moves round the Sun]], and studied solar and lunar [[eclipse]]s. Aryabhata's most famous work was ''Aryabhatiya''. [[Varahamihira]]'s most important contributions are the encyclopaedic [[Brihat-Samhita]] and ''[[Pancha-Siddhantika]]'' (''{{IAST|Pa\u00f1casiddh&#257;ntik&#257;}}'').

The material sources of this age were [[Kalidasa]]'s works. [[Raghuvamsa]], [[Malavikagnimitram]], [[Meghad&#363;ta]], [[Abhij\u00f1&#257;na&#347;&#257;kuntala]] and [[Kum&#257;rasambhava]], [[Mrichchakatika]] by [[Shudraka]], [[Panchatantra]] by [[Vishnu Sharma]], [[Kama Sutra]] (the principles of pleasure) and 13 plays by [[Bhasa]] were also written in this period.\n\nIn medicine, the Guptas were notable for their establishment and patronage of free hospitals. Although progress in physiology and biology was hindered by religious injunctions against contact with dead bodies, which discouraged dissection and anatomy, Indian physicians excelled in pharmacopoeia, caesarean section, bone setting, and skin grafting. Indeed, Hindu medical advances were soon adopted in the [[Arab]] and Western worlds. [[Ayurveda]] was the main medical system.\n\nAccording to some historian's work, {{quote|The Gupta Empire is considered by many scholars to be the \"classical age\" of Hindu and Buddhist art and literature. The Rulers of the Gupta Empire were strong supporters of developments in the arts, architecture, science, and literature. The Gupta Empire circulated a large number of gold coins, called dinars, with their inscriptions. The Gupta Dynasty also left behind an effective administrative system. During times of peace, the Gupta Empire system was decentralised, with only taxation flowing to the capital at Pataliputra. During times of war however, the government realigned and fought its invaders. The system was soon extinguished in fighting off the Hunnic Invasions.<ref>Omalley L S S, History Of Magadh, Veena Publication, 2005, {{ISBN|81-89224-01-8}}</ref><ref>Cultural Pasts: Essays in Early Indian History, 2003; Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0-19-566487-6}}</ref>}}\n\n[[Image:Nalanda.jpg|left|thumb|200px|[[Nalanda]] is considered one of the first great universities in recorded history.

The name ''Pala'' ([[pa language|Modern]] {{lang-bn|\u09aa\u09be\u09b2}} ''pal'') means ''protector'' and was used as an ending to the names of all Pala monarchs. The Palas were followers of the [[Mahayana]] and [[Tantra|Tantric]] schools of Buddhism. [[Gopala (Pala king)|Gopala]] was the first ruler from the dynasty. He came to [[power (sociology)|power]] in 750 in [[Gaur, West Bengal|Gaur]] by a [[democracy|democratic]] [[election]]. This event is recognised as one of the first [[democratic election]]s in [[South Asia]] since the time of the [[Mahajanapadas|Mah&#257; Janapadas]]. He reigned from 750-770 and consolidated his position by extending his control over all of [[Bengal]] as well as parts of [[Bihar]]. The Buddhist [[dynasty]] lasted for four centuries (750-1120 CE).\n\nThe empire reached its peak under [[Dharmapala of Bengal|Dharmapala]] and [[Devapala (Pala dynasty)|Devapala]]. Dharmapala extended the empire into the northern parts of the [[Indian Subcontinent]]. This triggered once again the power struggle for the control of the subcontinent. Devapala, successor of Dharmapala, expanded the empire to cover much of [[South Asia]] and beyond. His empire stretched from [[Assam]] and [[Utkala Kingdom|Utkala]] in the east, [[Kamboja Kingdom|Kamboja]] (modern day [[Afghanistan]]) in the north-west and [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]] in the south.

From this point, Bihar remained a part the [[Bengal Presidency]] of the British Raj until 1912, when the province of [[Bihar and Orissa Province|Bihar and Orissa]] was carved out as a separate province. When the Bengal Presidency was partitioned in 1912 to carve out a separate province, Patna was made the capital of the new province. The city limits were stretched westwards to accommodate the administrative base, and the township of [[Bankipore]] took shape along the Bailey Road (originally spelt as Bayley Road, after the first Lt. Governor, [[Charles Stuart Bayley]]). This area was called the ''New Capital Area''. The houses of the English residents, were all at the west-end at Bankipore. The greater part of the English residences were on the banks of the river, many of them being on the northern side of an open square, which formed the parade ground, and racecourse (present [[Gandhi Maidan]]). There was also the [[Golghar]] a wondrous bell-shaped building, one hundred feet high, with a winding outer staircase leading to the top, and a small entrance door at the base, which was intended for a granary, to be filled when there was the expectation of famine. It was initially considered to be both politically and materially impracticable.\n[[File:Dr Rajendra Pd. DR.Anugrah Narayan Sinha.jpg|thumb|left|186px|(Sitting L to R) ''Deshratna'' Dr.[[Rajendra Prasad]] and ''Bihar Vibhuti'' [[Anugrah Narayan Sinha]] during [[Mahatma Gandhi]]'s 1917 Champaran Satyagraha]]\n\nTo this day, locals call the old area as the City whereas the new area is called the New Capital Area. The [[Patna Secretariat]] with its imposing clock tower and the [[Patna High Court]] are two imposing landmarks of this era of development. Credit for designing the massive and majestic buildings of colonial Patna goes to the architect, I. F. Munnings. By 1916\u20131917, most of the buildings were ready for occupation. These buildings reflect either [[Indo-Saracenic]] influence (like [[Patna Museum]] and the state Assembly), or overt [[Renaissance]] influence like the Raj Bhawan and the High Court. Some buildings, like the General Post Office (GPO) and the Old Secretariat bear pseudo-Renaissance influence. Some say, the experience gained in building the new capital area of Patna proved very useful in building the imperial capital of [[New Delhi]].\n\nThe British built several educational institutions in Patna like [[Patna College]], [[Patna Science College]], [[Bihar College of Engineering]], [[PMCH|Prince of Wales Medical College]] and the [[Bihar Veterinary College]]. With government patronage, the Biharis quickly seized the opportunity to make these centres flourish quickly and attain renown. In 1935, certain portions of Bihar were reorganised into the separate province of [[Odisha|Orissa]]. Patna continued as the capital of Bihar province under the British Raj.\n\n=== Independence movement ===\nBihar played a major role in the [[Indian independence movement|Indian independence struggle]]. Most notable were the [[Champaran]] movement against the Indigo plantation and the [[Quit India Movement]] of 1942.\n\nAfter his return from South Africa, it was from Bihar that [[Mahatma Gandhi]] launched his pioneering civil-disobedience movement, [[Champaran Satyagraha]].<ref>{{cite book\n| last = Brown\n| title = Gandhi's Rise to Power, Indian Politics 1915-1922: Indian Politics 1915-1922\n| publisher = Cambridge University Press Archive\n| location = New Delhi\n| year = 1972\n| isbn = 978-0-521-09873-1\n| page = 384\n}}</ref> [[Raj Kumar Shukla]] drew Mahatma Gandhi's attention to the exploitation of the peasants by the European [[indigo]] planters.

Raj Kumar Shukla drew the attention of [[Mahatma Gandhi]], who had just returned from South Africa, to the plight of the peasants suffering under an oppressive system established by European indigo planters. Besides other excesses they were forced to cultivate indigo on 3/20 part of their holding and sell it to the planters at prices fixed by the planters. This marked Gandhi's entry into the India's independence movement. On arrival at the district headquarters in [[Motihari]], Gandhi and his team of lawyers\u2014Dr. [[Rajendra Prasad]], Dr. Anugrah Narayan Sinha, Brajkishore Prasad and Ram Navami Prasad, who he had handpicked to participate in the [[satyagraha]]\u2014were ordered to leave by the next available train. They refused to do this, and Gandhi was arrested. He was released and the ban order was withdrawn in the face of a \"Satyagraha\" threat. Gandhi conducted an open inquiry into the peasant's grievances. The Government had to appoint an inquiry committee with Gandhi as a member. This led to the abolition of the system.\n\n[[Raj Kumar Shukla]] has been described by Gandhi in his ''Atmakatha'', as a man whose suffering gave him the strength to rise against the odds. In his letter to Gandhi he wrote \"Respected Mahatma, You hear the stories of others everyday. Today please listen to my story.... I want to draw your attention to the promise made by you in the [[Lucknow]] Congress that you would come to Champaran. The time has come for you to fulfill your promise. 1.9&nbsp;million suffering people of Champaran are waiting to see you.\"\n\nGandhi reached Patna on 10 April 1917 and on 16 April he reached [[Motihari]] accompanied by [[Raj Kumar Shukla]]. Under Gandhi's leadership the historic \"Champaran Satyagraha\" began. The contribution of Raj Kumar Shukla is reflected in the writings of Dr. Rajendra Prasad, first President of India, Anugrah Narayan Sinha, [[Acharya Kriplani]] and Mahatma Gandhi. Raj Kumar Shukla maintained a diary in which he gave an account of struggle against the atrocities of the indigo planters, atrocities so movingly depicted by [[Dinabandhu Mitra]] in [[Nil Darpan]], a play that was translated by [[Michael Madhusudan Dutt]]. This movement by Mahatma Gandhi received the spontaneous support of a cross section of people, including Dr. [[Rajendra Prasad]], Bihar Kesari [[Sri Krishna Sinha]], Dr. Anugrah Narayan Sinha and Brajkishore Prasad.\n\nShaheed [[Baikuntha Shukla]] was another nationalist from Bihar, who was hanged for murdering a government approver named Phanindrananth Ghosh. This led to the hanging of [[Bhagat Singh]], [[Sukhdev]] and [[Rajguru]]. Phanindranath Ghosh hitherto a key member of the [[Democratic Revolutionary Peoples Party|Revolutionary Party]] had betrayed the cause by turning an approver and giving evidence, which led to his murder. Baikunth was commissioned to plan the murder of Ghosh. He carried out the killing successfully on 9 November 1932. He was arrested, tried, convicted, and, on 14 May 1934, he was hanged in Gaya Central Jail.\n\nIn North and Central Bihar, a peasant movement was an important side effect of the independence movement. The Kisan Sabha movement started in Bihar under the leadership of [[Swami Sahajanand Saraswati]] who in 1929 had formed the [[Bihar Provincial Kisan Sabha]] (BPKS) to mobilise peasant grievances against the [[zamindar]]i attacks on their occupancy rights.<ref>{{cite book\n | first = &#346;ekhara\n | last = Bandyop&#257;dhy&#257;ya\n | title = From Plassey to Partition: A History of Modern India\n | publisher = [[Orient Longman]]\n | year = 2004\n | isbn = 978-81-250-2596-2\n | pages = 523 (at p 406)\n }}</ref> Gradually the peasant movement intensified and spread across the rest of India. All these radical developments on the peasant front culminated in the formation of the [[All India Kisan Sabha]] (AIKS) at the [[Lucknow]] session of the [[Indian National Congress]] in April 1936, with [[Swami Sahajanand Saraswati]] elected as its first President.<ref>{{cite book\n | first = &#346;ekhara\n | last = Bandyop&#257;dhy&#257;ya\n | title = From Plassey to Partition: A History of Modern India\n | publisher = [[Orient Longman]]\n | year = 2004\n | isbn = 978-81-250-2596-2\n | pages = 523 (at p 407)\n }}</ref> This movement aimed at overthrowing the fedual zamindari system instituted by the [[United Kingdom|British]]. It was led by [[Swami Sahajanand Saraswati]] and his followers [[Pandit Yamuna Karjee]], [[Rahul Sankrityayan]] and others. Pandit Yamuna Karjee along with Rahul Sankrityayan and other Hindi literaries started publishing a [[Hindi]] weekly [[Hunkar (epic poem)|Hunkar]] from Bihar in 1940. Hunkar later became the mouthpiece of the peasant movement and the agrarian movement in Bihar and was instrumental in spreading the movement. The peasant movement later spread to other parts of the country and helped in digging out the British roots in the Indian society by overthrowing the [[zamindari]] system.\n\nBihar's contribution in the independence movement has been immense with famous leaders like [[Swami Sahajanand Saraswati]],<ref>{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.kamat.com/kalranga/freedom/congress/c127.htm\n |title       = Great freedom Fighters\n |author      = Kamat\n |publisher   = Kamat's archive\n |accessdate  = 2006-02-25\n |url-status     = live\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20060220003547/http://www.kamat.com/kalranga/freedom/congress/c127.htm\n |archivedate = 20 February 2006\n |df          = dmy-all\n}}\n</ref> Shaheed [[Baikuntha Shukla]], [[Sri Krishna Singh (Sinha)]],''Bihar Bibhuti'' Anugrah Narayan Sinha, Mulana Mazharul Haque, ''Loknayak'' [[Jayaprakash Narayan]], [[Basawon Singh (Sinha)]], [[Yogendra Shukla]], [[Sheel Bhadra Yajee]], [[Pandit Yamuna Karjee]], [[Dr. Maghfoor Ahmad Ajazi]] and many others who worked for India's indepdence and worked to lift up the underprivileged masses.

They have profoundly influenced practices that Hinduism and Indian spiritual orders are associated with namely, [[vegetarianism]], prohibition of animal slaughter and [[ahimsa]] (non-violence).\n\nWhile the geographic impact of Jainism was limited to India, Buddhist nuns and monks eventually spread the teachings of [[Buddha]] to [[Central Asia]], [[East Asia]], [[Tibet]], [[Sri Lanka]] and South East Asia. [[Nalanda University]] and [[Vikramshila University]] one of the oldest residential universities were established in Bihar during this period.\n\nAccording to both Buddhist texts and Jain texts, one of Pradyota tradition was that king's son would kill his father to become the successor. During this time, it is reported that there was high crimes in Magadha. The people rose up and elected [[Shishunaga]] to become the new king, who destroyed the power of the Pradyotas and created the [[Shishunaga dynasty]].\n\n== The Magadha Empire ==\n{{Main|Magadha}}\n{{See also|Shishunaga dynasty|Nanda Dynasty|Mauryan dynasty|Shunga dynasty|Kanva dynasty}}\n{{Further|Bimbisara|Ajatashatru|Mahapadma Nanda|Chandragupta Maurya|Bindusara|Ashoka|Samprati|Pushyamitra Shunga}}\n{{Further|Kalinga War|Rajgriha|Pataliputra|Edicts of Ashoka|Ashokavadana|Arthashastra|Emblem of India}}\n{{Further|Ambapali|Chanakya|Brhadrata}}\n\n[[Shishunaga]] (also called King [[Sisunaka]]) was the founder of a dynasty collectively called the [[Shishunaga dynasty]]. He established the [[Shishunaga dynasty|Magadha empire]] (in 684 BCE). Due in part to this bloody dynastic feuding, it is thought that a civil revolt led to the emergence of the Shishunaga dynasty. This empire, with its original capital in [[Rajgir|Rajgriha]], later shifted to [[Pataliputra]] (both currently in the Indian state of Bihar). The Shishunaga dynasty was one of the largest empires of the [[Indian subcontinent]].\n\nThe Hariyanka dynasty king [[Bimbisara]] was responsible for expanding the boundaries of his kingdom through matrimonial alliances and conquest. The land of [[Kosala]] fell to Magadha in this way. Estimates place the territory ruled by this early dynasty at 300 leagues in diameter, and encompassing 80,000 small settlements. [[Bimbisara]] is contemporary with the Buddha, and is recorded as a lay disciple. Bimbisara (543\u2013493 BCE) was imprisoned and killed by his own son who became his successor, [[Ajatashatru]] (491\u2013461 BCE), under whose rule, the dynasty reached its largest extent.\n\n{|  class=\"toccolours\" style=\"float:right; margin:0 0 1em 1em;\"\n| style=\"background:#f8eaba; text-align:center;\"|\n<div class=\"center\">\n; Magadha\n</div>\n|-\n|\n<gallery>\nFile:Bimbisarajail.jpg|''[[Bimbisara]]'s jail'', where King Bimbisara was imprisoned by his son [[Ajatashatru]], in [[Rajgir]]\nFile:Ajatashatru stupa at Rajgir.jpg|[[Ajatashatru]]'s [[stupa]] in [[Rajgir]], where his ashes were interred.\n</gallery>\n|-\n|\n<gallery>\nFile:Ashoka pillar at Vaishali, Bihar, India.jpg|[[Vaishali (ancient city)|Vaishali]] was the [[Capital (political)|capital]] of [[Vajji|Vajjian Confederacy]], believed to be the world's earliest [[republic]].<ref name=\"eb-vaisali\" /><ref>{{cite book|title=India: Lonely planet Guide|last=Bindloss|first=Joe|authorlink=|author2=Sarina Singh|year=2007|publisher=[[Lonely Planet]]|isbn= 978-1-74104-308-2|page=556|url=https://books.google.com/?id=T7ZHUhSEleYC&pg=PA556&dq=Vaishali#v=onepage&q=Vaishali|ref= }}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Students' Britannica India, Volumes 1-5|last=Hoiberg|first=Dale|authorlink=|author2=Indu Ramchandani|year=2000|publisher=Popular Prakashan|isbn=0-85229-760-2|page=208|url=https://books.google.com/?id=DPP7O3nb3g0C&pg=PA208&dq=Vaishali#v=onepage&q=Vaishali|ref= }}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=A history of India|last=Kulke|first=Hermann|authorlink=|author2=Dietmar Rothermund|year=2004|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-415-32919-1|page= 57|url=https://books.google.com/?id=TPVq3ykHyH4C&pg=PA57&dq=Vaishali&q=Vaishali|ref= }}</ref>\nFile:Asokanpillar1.jpg|Ashokan Pillar at [[Vaishali (ancient city)|Vaishali]].\n</gallery>\n|}\nLicchavi was an ancient\u2014before the birth of [[Mahavira]]\u2014 [[republic]] in what is now the Bihar state of India.<ref name=\"eb-vaisali\" /> [[Vaishali (ancient city)|Vaishali]] was the capital of Licchavi and the [[Vajji|Vajjian Confederacy]].

Ajatashatru is thought to have ruled from 551 BCE to 519 BCE and moved the capital of the Magadha kingdom from [[Rajagriha]] to [[Pataliputra]]. The [[Mahavamsa]] tells that Udayabhadra eventually succeeded his father, Ajatashatru, and that under him Pataliputra became the largest city in the world. He is thought to have ruled for sixteen years. The kingdom had a particularly bloody succession. Anuruddha eventually succeeded Udaybhadra through assassination, and his son Munda succeeded him in the same fashion, as did his son [[Nagadasaka]].\n\n[[File:Nanda Empire, c.325 BCE.png|thumb|left|200px|The [[Nanda Empire]] at its greatest extent under [[Dhana Nanda]] c. 323 BCE.]]\nThis dynasty lasted until 424 BCE, when it was overthrown by the [[Nanda dynasty]]. This period saw the development in Magadha of two of India's major religions. [[Gautama Buddha]] in the 6th or 5th century BCE was the founder of Buddhism, which later spread to East Asia and [[Southeast Asia]], while [[Mahavira]] revived and propagated the ancient [[\u015arama\u1e47a|sramanic]] religion of Jainism.\n\nThe [[Nanda Dynasty|Nanda dynasty]] was established by an illegitimate son of King [[Mahanandin]] from the previous [[Shishunaga dynasty]]. The [[Nanda dynasty]] ruled Magadha during the 5th and 4th centuries BC. At its greatest extent, the Nanda Empire extended from [[Burma]] in the east, [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Balochistan]] in the west and probably as far south as [[Karnataka]].<ref>Radha Kumud Mookerji, ''Chandragupta Maurya and His Times'', 4th ed.

The Maurya Empire (322\u2013185 BC), ruled by the [[Mauryan dynasty]], was geographically extensive, powerful and a political-military empire in [[history of India|ancient India]]. During this time, most of the subcontinent was united under a single government for the first time. The exceptions were present day [[Tamil Nadu]] and [[Kerala]] (which was a [[Ancient Tamil country|Tamil kingdom]] at that time). The empire had its capital city at [[Pataliputra]] (near modern [[Patna]]). The Mauryan empire under Chandragupta Maurya would not only conquer most of the Indian subcontinent, defeating and conquering the [[satrap]]s left by [[Alexander the Great]], but also push its boundaries into [[Persia]] and Central Asia, conquering the [[Gandhara]] region. Chandragupta Maurya then defeated an invasion led by [[Seleucus I Nicator|Seleucus I]], a Greek general from Alexander's army. Chandragupta Maurya's minister, [[Kautilya Chanakya]], wrote the ''[[Arthashastra]]'', a treatise on economics, politics, foreign affairs, administration, military arts, war and religion.\n\nChandragupta Maurya was succeeded by his son, [[Bindusara]], who expanded the kingdom over most of present-day India, other than the extreme south and east. At its greatest extent, the Empire stretched to the north along the natural boundaries of the [[Himalayas]], and to the east stretching into what is now [[Assam]]. To the west, it reached beyond modern Pakistan, annexing [[Balochistan (region)|Balochistan]] and much of what is now [[Afghanistan]]. The Empire was extended into India's central and southern regions by the emperors Chandragupta and [[Bindusara]], but it excluded the republic of Kalinga.\n\nThe Maurya Empire was inherited by [[Bindusara]]'s son, [[Ashoka The Great|Ashoka]]. Ashoka initially sought to expand his kingdom but in the aftermath of the carnage caused during the invasion of Kalinga, he renounced bloodshed and pursued a policy of non-violence or [[ahimsa]] after converting to Buddhism. Following the conquest of Kalinga, Ashoka ended the military expansion of the empire, and led the empire through more than 40 years of relative peace, harmony and prosperity. Ashoka's response to the Kalinga War is recorded in the [[Edicts of Ashoka]],<ref>The [[Edicts of Ashoka]] are a collection of 33 inscriptions on the [[Pillars of Ashoka]]</ref> one of the oldest preserved historical documents of the Indian subcontinent.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://history-world.org/indian_empire.htm |title=The First Indian Empire |publisher=History-world.org |accessdate=2012-08-15 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120515101903/http://history-world.org/indian_empire.htm |archivedate=15 May 2012 |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.buddhistchannel.tv/index.php?id=4,2658,0,0,1,0 |title=Archaeology Gandhara's wonders |accessdate=2008-12-04 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090202223151/http://www.buddhistchannel.tv/index.php?id=4,2658,0,0,1,0 |archivedate=2 February 2009 |df=dmy-all }} [[Edicts of Ashoka]] at Shahbaz Garhi are among the oldest historical \"documents\" found on the subcontinent.</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cs.colostate.edu/~malaiya/ashoka.html |title=KING ASHOKA: His Edicts and His Times |accessdate=2006-11-15 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131028175927/http://www.cs.colostate.edu/~malaiya/ashoka.html |archivedate=28 October 2013 |df=dmy-all }} [[Edicts of Ashoka]], which comprise the earliest decipherable corpus of written documents from India, have survived throughout the centuries because they are written on rocks and stone pillars.</ref>\n\n[[File:MauryaStatuettes.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Mauryan]] [[Sculpture]]s]]\nAccording to Rock Edicts of Ashoka: {{quote|text=\"Beloved-of-the-Gods [Ashoka], King Priyadarsi, conquered the Kalingas eight years after his coronation. 150000 were deported, 100000 were killed and much more died (from other causes).

Under Ashoka, India was a prosperous and stable empire of great economic and military power whose political influence and trade extended across Asia and into Europe. Chandragupta Maurya's embrace of Jainism increased social and religious renewal and reform across his society, while Ashoka embraced Buddhism. Ashoka sponsored the spreading of Buddhist ideals into Sri Lanka and South-East Asia. The ''[[Lion Capital of Ashoka]]'' at [[Sarnath]], is the [[emblem of India]]. Archaeologically, the period of Mauryan rule in South Asia falls into the era of [[Northern Black Polished Ware]] (NBPW). The ''Arthashastra'', the Edicts of Ashoka and [[Ashokavadana]] are primary sources of written records of the Mauryan times.\n\n[[File:SungaEmpireMap.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The [[Shunga Empire]] at its greatest extent -c. 185 BCE]]\nAshoka was followed for 50 years by a succession of weaker kings. [[Brihadrata]], the last ruler of the Mauryan dynasty, held territories that had shrunk considerably from the time of emperor Ashoka, although he still upheld the Buddhist faith. The [[Shunga dynasty]] was established in 185 BC, about fifty years after Ashoka's death, when the king Brihadratha, the last of the Mauryan rulers, was assassinated by the then commander-in-chief of the [[Mauryan]] [[armed forces]], [[Pushyamitra Shunga]].\n\nPushyamitra Shunga was a Brahmin who then took over the throne and established the Shunga dynasty. [[Decline of Buddhism in India#The Shungas|Buddhist records]] such as the Ashokavadana write that the assassination of Brihadrata and the rise of the Shunga empire led to a wave of [[Decline of Buddhism in India#The Shungas|persecution of Buddhists]],<ref>According to the Ashokavadana.</ref> and a resurgence of [[Hinduism]].

The origins of the Gupta Dynasty are shrouded in obscurity. The Chinese traveller [[Xuanzang]] provides the first evidence of the Gupta kingdom in Magadha. He came to India in 672 CE and heard of '[[Maharaja Sri-Gupta]]' who built a temple for Chinese pilgrims near ''Mrigasikhavana''. [[Ghatotkacha (Gupta Ruler)|Ghatotkacha]] (c. 280&ndash;319) CE, had a son named [[Chandra Gupta I]] (Not to be confused with [[Chandragupta Maurya]] (340\u2013293 BC), founder of the Mauryan Empire). In a breakthrough deal, Chandra Gupta I was married to a woman from Lichchhavi&mdash;the main power in Magadha.\n\n[[Samudragupta]] succeeded Chandra Gupta I in 335, and ruled for about 45 years, until his death in 380. He attacked the kingdoms of Shichchhatra, Padmavati, [[Malwa]]s, the [[Yaudheyas]], the [[Arjunayanas]], the [[Mathura, Uttar Pradesh|Maduras]] and the [[Abhiras]], and merged them in his kingdom. By his death in 380, he had incorporated over twenty kingdoms into his realm, his rule extended from the Himalayas to the river [[Narmada River|Narmada]] and from the [[Brahmaputra river|Brahmaputra]] to the [[Yamuna river|Yamuna]]. He gave himself the titles ''King of Kings'' and ''World Monarch''. He is considered the ''Napoleon of India''. Chandra Gupta I performed ''[[Ashwamedha Yajna]]'' to underline the importance of his conquest.\n\n[[Chandra Gupta II]], the Sun of Power (''[[Vikramaditya]]''), ruled from 380 until 413. Only marginally less successful than his father, Chandra Gupta II expanded his realm westwards, defeating the [[Saka]] [[Western Kshatrapas]] of [[Malwa]], [[Gujarat]] and [[Saurashtra (region)|Saurashtra]] in a campaign lasting until 409. Chandragupta II was succeeded by his son [[Kumara Gupta I|Kumaragupta I]]. Known as the ''Mahendraditya'', he ruled until 455. Towards the end of his reign a tribe in the Narmada valley, the [[Pushyamitras]], rose in power to threaten the empire.\n\n[[Skandagupta]] is generally considered the last of the great rulers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/547260/Skanda-Gupta |title=Skanda Gupta (Gupta ruler) - Britannica Online Encyclopaedia |publisher=Britannica.com |accessdate=2012-08-15 |url-status=live |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140307082712/http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/547260/Skanda-Gupta |archivedate=7 March 2014 |df=dmy-all }}</ref> He defeated the Pushyamitra threat, but then was faced with invading [[Hephthalite]]s or [[Huna (people)|Huna]], from the northwest.

[[Skandagupta]] died in 487 and was succeeded by his son [[Narasimhagupta]] ''Baladitya''.\n\nThe Gupta Empire was one of the largest political and military empires in [[History of India|ancient India]]. The [[Gupta period]] is referred to as the Classical age of India by most historians.

The difference between Gupta Empire's and Mauryan Empire's administration was that in the Mauryan administration power was centralised but in the Gupta administration power was more decentralised. The empire was divided into provinces and the provinces were further divided into districts. Villages were the smallest units. The kingdom covered [[Gujarat]], [[North-East India]], south-eastern Pakistan, [[Odisha]], northern [[Madhya Pradesh]] and eastern India with capital at [[Pataliputra]], modern [[Patna]]. All forms of worship were carried out in [[Sanskrit]].\n\nRapid strides were made in [[astronomy]] during this period. [[Aryabhata]] and [[Varahamihira]] were two great astronomers and [[mathematicians]]. Aryabhata stated that the earth moved round the sun and rotated on its own axis. Aryabhata, who is believed to be the first to come up with the concept of [[zero]], postulated the theory that [[heliocentrism|the Earth moves round the Sun]], and studied solar and lunar [[eclipse]]s. Aryabhata's most famous work was ''Aryabhatiya''. [[Varahamihira]]'s most important contributions are the encyclopaedic [[Brihat-Samhita]] and ''[[Pancha-Siddhantika]]'' (''{{IAST|Pa\u00f1casiddh&#257;ntik&#257;}}''). Metallurgy also made rapid strides.

The material sources of this age were [[Kalidasa]]'s works. [[Raghuvamsa]], [[Malavikagnimitram]], [[Meghad&#363;ta]], [[Abhij\u00f1&#257;na&#347;&#257;kuntala]] and [[Kum&#257;rasambhava]], [[Mrichchakatika]] by [[Shudraka]], [[Panchatantra]] by [[Vishnu Sharma]], [[Kama Sutra]] (the principles of pleasure) and 13 plays by [[Bhasa]] were also written in this period.\n\nIn medicine, the Guptas were notable for their establishment and patronage of free hospitals. Although progress in physiology and biology was hindered by religious injunctions against contact with dead bodies, which discouraged dissection and anatomy, Indian physicians excelled in pharmacopoeia, caesarean section, bone setting, and skin grafting. Indeed, Hindu medical advances were soon adopted in the [[Arab]] and Western worlds. [[Ayurveda]] was the main medical system.\n\nAccording to some historian's work, {{quote|The Gupta Empire is considered by many scholars to be the \"classical age\" of Hindu and Buddhist art and literature. The Rulers of the Gupta Empire were strong supporters of developments in the arts, architecture, science, and literature. The Gupta Empire circulated a large number of gold coins, called dinars, with their inscriptions. The Gupta Dynasty also left behind an effective administrative system. During times of peace, the Gupta Empire system was decentralised, with only taxation flowing to the capital at Pataliputra. During times of war however, the government realigned and fought its invaders. The system was soon extinguished in fighting off the Hunnic Invasions.<ref>Omalley L S S, History Of Magadh, Veena Publication, 2005, {{ISBN|81-89224-01-8}}</ref><ref>Cultural Pasts: Essays in Early Indian History, 2003; Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0-19-566487-6}}</ref>}}\n\n[[Image:Nalanda.jpg|left|thumb|200px|[[Nalanda]] is considered one of the first great universities in recorded history.

The name ''Pala'' ([[pa language|Modern]] {{lang-bn|\u09aa\u09be\u09b2}} ''pal'') means ''protector'' and was used as an ending to the names of all Pala monarchs. The Palas were followers of the [[Mahayana]] and [[Tantra|Tantric]] schools of Buddhism. [[Gopala (Pala king)|Gopala]] was the first ruler from the dynasty. He came to [[power (sociology)|power]] in 750 in [[Gaur, West Bengal|Gaur]] by a [[democracy|democratic]] [[election]]. This event is recognised as one of the first [[democratic election]]s in [[South Asia]] since the time of the [[Mahajanapadas|Mah&#257; Janapadas]]. He reigned from 750-770 and consolidated his position by extending his control over all of [[Bengal]] as well as parts of [[Bihar]]. The Buddhist [[dynasty]] lasted for four centuries (750-1120 CE).\n\nThe empire reached its peak under [[Dharmapala of Bengal|Dharmapala]] and [[Devapala (Pala dynasty)|Devapala]]. Dharmapala extended the empire into the northern parts of the [[Indian Subcontinent]]. This triggered once again the power struggle for the control of the subcontinent. Devapala, successor of Dharmapala, expanded the empire to cover much of [[South Asia]] and beyond. His empire stretched from [[Assam]] and [[Utkala Kingdom|Utkala]] in the east, [[Kamboja Kingdom|Kamboja]] (modern day [[Afghanistan]]) in the north-west and [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]] in the south. According to Pala copperplate inscription, Devapala exterminated the Utkalas, conquered the Pragjyotisha (Assam), shattered the pride of the [[Huna (people)|Huna]], and humbled the lords of [[Pratihara]]s, [[Gurjara]] and the [[Dravidian people|Dravidas]].\n\nThe Palas created many temples and works of art as well as supported the Universities of [[Nalanda]] and [[Vikramashila]]. Both [[Nalanda University]] and [[Vikramshila University]] reached their peak under the Palas. The universities received an influx of students from many parts of the world.

From this point, Bihar remained a part the [[Bengal Presidency]] of the British Raj until 1912, when the province of [[Bihar and Orissa Province|Bihar and Orissa]] was carved out as a separate province. When the Bengal Presidency was partitioned in 1912 to carve out a separate province, Patna was made the capital of the new province. The city limits were stretched westwards to accommodate the administrative base, and the township of [[Bankipore]] took shape along the Bailey Road (originally spelt as Bayley Road, after the first Lt. Governor, [[Charles Stuart Bayley]]). This area was called the ''New Capital Area''. The houses of the English residents, were all at the west-end at Bankipore. The greater part of the English residences were on the banks of the river, many of them being on the northern side of an open square, which formed the parade ground, and racecourse (present [[Gandhi Maidan]]). There was also the [[Golghar]] a wondrous bell-shaped building, one hundred feet high, with a winding outer staircase leading to the top, and a small entrance door at the base, which was intended for a granary, to be filled when there was the expectation of famine. It was initially considered to be both politically and materially impracticable.\n[[File:Dr Rajendra Pd. DR.Anugrah Narayan Sinha.jpg|thumb|left|186px|(Sitting L to R) ''Deshratna'' Dr.[[Rajendra Prasad]] and ''Bihar Vibhuti'' [[Anugrah Narayan Sinha]] during [[Mahatma Gandhi]]'s 1917 Champaran Satyagraha]]\n\nTo this day, locals call the old area as the City whereas the new area is called the New Capital Area. The [[Patna Secretariat]] with its imposing clock tower and the [[Patna High Court]] are two imposing landmarks of this era of development. Credit for designing the massive and majestic buildings of colonial Patna goes to the architect, I. F. Munnings. By 1916-1917, most of the buildings were ready for occupation. These buildings reflect either [[Indo-Saracenic]] influence (like [[Patna Museum]] and the state Assembly), or overt [[Renaissance]] influence like the Raj Bhawan and the High Court. Some buildings, like the General Post Office (GPO) and the Old Secretariat bear pseudo-Renaissance influence. Some say, the experience gained in building the new capital area of Patna proved very useful in building the imperial capital of [[New Delhi]].\n\nThe British built several educational institutions in Patna like [[Patna College]], [[Patna Science College]], [[Bihar College of Engineering]], [[PMCH|Prince of Wales Medical College]] and the [[Bihar Veterinary College]]. With government patronage, the Biharis quickly seized the opportunity to make these centres flourish quickly and attain renown. In 1935, certain portions of Bihar were reorganised into the separate province of [[Odisha|Orissa]]. Patna continued as the capital of Bihar province under the British Raj.\n\n=== Independence movement ===\nBihar played a major role in the [[Indian independence movement|Indian independence struggle]]. Most notable were the [[Champaran]] movement against the Indigo plantation and the [[Quit India Movement]] of 1942.\n\nAfter his return from South Africa, it was from Bihar that [[Mahatma Gandhi]] launched his pioneering civil-disobedience movement, [[Champaran Satyagraha]].<ref>{{cite book\n| last = Brown\n| title = Gandhi's Rise to Power, Indian Politics 1915-1922: Indian Politics 1915-1922\n| publisher = Cambridge University Press Archive\n| location = New Delhi\n| year = 1972\n| isbn = 978-0-521-09873-1\n| page = 384\n}}</ref> [[Raj Kumar Shukla]] drew Mahatma Gandhi's attention to the exploitation of the peasants by the European [[indigo]] planters.

Raj Kumar Shukla drew the attention of [[Mahatma Gandhi]], who had just returned from South Africa, to the plight of the peasants suffering under an oppressive system established by European indigo planters. Besides other excesses they were forced to cultivate indigo on 3/20 part of their holding and sell it to the planters at prices fixed by the planters. This marked Gandhi's entry into the India's independence movement. On arrival at the district headquarters in [[Motihari]], Gandhi and his team of lawyers\u2014Dr. [[Rajendra Prasad]], Dr. Anugrah Narayan Sinha, Brajkishore Prasad and Ram Navami Prasad, who he had handpicked to participate in the [[satyagraha]]\u2014were ordered to leave by the next available train. They refused to do this, and Gandhi was arrested. He was released and the ban order was withdrawn in the face of a \"Satyagraha\" threat. Gandhi conducted an open inquiry into the peasant's grievances. The Government had to appoint an inquiry committee with Gandhi as a member. This led to the abolition of the system.\n\n[[Raj Kumar Shukla]] has been described by Gandhi in his ''Atmakatha'', as a man whose suffering gave him the strength to rise against the odds. In his letter to Gandhi he wrote \"Respected Mahatma, You hear the stories of others everyday. Today please listen to my story.... I want to draw your attention to the promise made by you in the [[Lucknow]] Congress that you would come to Champaran. The time has come for you to fulfill your promise. 1.9&nbsp;million suffering people of Champaran are waiting to see you.\"\n\nGandhi reached Patna on 10 April 1917 and on 16 April he reached [[Motihari]] accompanied by [[Raj Kumar Shukla]]. Under Gandhi's leadership the historic \"Champaran Satyagraha\" began. The contribution of Raj Kumar Shukla is reflected in the writings of Dr. Rajendra Prasad, first President of India, Anugrah Narayan Sinha, [[Acharya Kriplani]] and Mahatma Gandhi. Raj Kumar Shukla maintained a diary in which he gave an account of struggle against the atrocities of the indigo planters, atrocities so movingly depicted by [[Dinabandhu Mitra]] in [[Nil Darpan]], a play that was translated by [[Michael Madhusudan Dutt]]. This movement by Mahatma Gandhi received the spontaneous support of a cross section of people, including Dr. [[Rajendra Prasad]], Bihar Kesari [[Sri Krishna Sinha]], Dr. Anugrah Narayan Sinha and Brajkishore Prasad.\n\nShaheed [[Baikuntha Shukla]] was another nationalist from Bihar, who was hanged for murdering a government approver named Phanindrananth Ghosh. This led to the hanging of [[Bhagat Singh]], [[Sukhdev]] and [[Rajguru]]. Phanindranath Ghosh hitherto a key member of the [[Democratic Revolutionary Peoples Party|Revolutionary Party]] had betrayed the cause by turning an approver and giving evidence, which led to his murder. Baikunth was commissioned to plan the murder of Ghosh. He carried out the killing successfully on 9 November 1932. He was arrested, tried, convicted, and, on 14 May 1934, he was hanged in Gaya Central Jail.\n\nIn North and Central Bihar, a peasant movement was an important side effect of the independence movement. The Kisan Sabha movement started in Bihar under the leadership of [[Swami Sahajanand Saraswati]] who in 1929 had formed the [[Bihar Provincial Kisan Sabha]] (BPKS) to mobilise peasant grievances against the [[zamindar]]i attacks on their occupancy rights.<ref>{{cite book\n | first = &#346;ekhara\n | last = Bandyop&#257;dhy&#257;ya\n | title = From Plassey to Partition: A History of Modern India\n | publisher = [[Orient Longman]]\n | year = 2004\n | isbn = 978-81-250-2596-2\n | pages = 523 (at p 406)\n }}</ref> Gradually the peasant movement intensified and spread across the rest of India. All these radical developments on the peasant front culminated in the formation of the [[All India Kisan Sabha]] (AIKS) at the [[Lucknow]] session of the [[Indian National Congress]] in April 1936, with [[Swami Sahajanand Saraswati]] elected as its first President.<ref>{{cite book\n | first = &#346;ekhara\n | last = Bandyop&#257;dhy&#257;ya\n | title = From Plassey to Partition: A History of Modern India\n | publisher = [[Orient Longman]]\n | year = 2004\n | isbn = 978-81-250-2596-2\n | pages = 523 (at p 407)\n }}</ref> This movement aimed at overthrowing the fedual zamindari system instituted by the [[United Kingdom|British]]. It was led by [[Swami Sahajanand Saraswati]] and his followers [[Pandit Yamuna Karjee]], [[Rahul Sankrityayan]] and others. Pandit Yamuna Karjee along with Rahul Sankrityayan and other Hindi literaries started publishing a [[Hindi]] weekly [[Hunkar (epic poem)|Hunkar]] from Bihar in 1940. Hunkar later became the mouthpiece of the peasant movement and the agrarian movement in Bihar and was instrumental in spreading the movement. The peasant movement later spread to other parts of the country and helped in digging out the British roots in the Indian society by overthrowing the [[zamindari]] system.\n\nBihar's contribution in the independence movement has been immense with famous leaders like [[Swami Sahajanand Saraswati]],<ref>{{cite web\n |url         = http://www.kamat.com/kalranga/freedom/congress/c127.htm\n |title       = Great freedom Fighters\n |author      = Kamat\n |publisher   = Kamat's archive\n |accessdate  = 2006-02-25\n |url-status     = live\n |archiveurl  = https://web.archive.org/web/20060220003547/http://www.kamat.com/kalranga/freedom/congress/c127.htm\n |archivedate = 20 February 2006\n |df          = dmy-all\n}}\n</ref> Shaheed [[Baikuntha Shukla]], [[Sri Krishna Singh (Sinha)]],''Bihar Bibhuti'' Anugrah Narayan Sinha, Mulana Mazharul Haque, ''Loknayak'' [[Jayaprakash Narayan]], [[Basawon Singh (Sinha)]], [[Yogendra Shukla]], [[Sheel Bhadra Yajee]], [[Pandit Yamuna Karjee]], [[Dr. Maghfoor Ahmad Ajazi]] and many others who worked for India's indepdence and worked to lift up the underprivileged masses.

It occurred early in the morning of July 11, 1804,<ref>{{cite web |url= http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/today/jul11.html |title=Today in History: July 11 |publisher=Library of Congress |accessdate=April 23, 2007}}</ref> and was the culmination of a long and bitter rivalry between the two men. Vice President Burr shot Hamilton, while Hamilton's shot broke a tree branch directly above Burr's head. Hamilton was carried to the home of [[William Bayard Jr.]] where he died the next day.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Schuyler.jpg|thumb|[[Philip Schuyler]], Hamilton's father in law.]] \nThe Burr\u2013Hamilton duel is one of the most famous personal conflicts in American history. It was a pistol duel which arose from long-standing personal bitterness that developed between the two men over the course of several years. Tension rose with Hamilton's journalistic defamation of Burr's character during the 1804 New York gubernatorial race, in which Burr was a candidate.\n\nThe duel was fought at a time when the practice was being outlawed in the northern United States, and it had immense political ramifications. Burr survived the duel and was indicted for murder in both [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[New Jersey]], though these charges were later either dismissed or resulted in acquittal. The harsh criticism and animosity directed toward him following the duel brought an end to his political career. The [[Federalist Party]] was already weakened by the defeat of [[John Adams]] in the presidential election of 1800 and was further weakened by Hamilton's death.\n\nThe duel was the final skirmish of a long conflict between [[Democratic-Republican Party|Democratic-Republicans]] and Federalists. The conflict began in 1791 when Burr won a United States Senate seat from [[Philip Schuyler]], Hamilton's father-in-law, who would have supported Federalist policies. (Hamilton was the Secretary of the Treasury at the time.) The [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] then deadlocked in the election of 1800, during which Hamilton's maneuvering in the House of Representatives caused [[Thomas Jefferson]] to be named president and Burr vice-president.<ref>See, for example, ''[http://www.gilderlehrman.org/history-by-era/early-republic/resources/%E2%80%9Cjefferson-every-view-less-dangerous-burr%E2%80%9D-hamilton-election \"Jefferson is in every view less dangerous than Burr\": Hamilton on the election of 1800]'' (Letter from Alexander Hamilton to Harrison Gray Otis: December 23, 1800).</ref>\n\nHamilton's animosity toward Burr was severe and well-documented in personal letters to his friend and compatriot [[James McHenry]]. The following quotation from one of these letters on January 4, 1801, exemplifies his bitterness:\n\n<blockquote>Nothing has given me so much chagrin as the Intelligence that the Federal party were thinking seriously of supporting Mr. Burr for president.  I should consider the execution of the plan as [[wikt:devote#3|devoting]] the country and signing their own death warrant.  Mr. Burr will probably make stipulations, but he will laugh in his sleeve while he makes them and will break them the first moment it may serve his purpose.<ref name=\"Steiner\">Bernard C. Steiner and James McHenry, ''[https://archive.org/details/lifeandcorrespo02steigoog The life and correspondence of James McHenry]'' (Cleveland: Burrows Brothers Co., 1907).</ref></blockquote>\n\nHamilton details the many charges that he has against Burr in a more extensive letter written shortly afterward, calling him a \"profligate, a voluptuary in the extreme\", accusing him of corruptly serving the interests of the [[Holland Land Company]] while a member of the legislature, criticizing his military commission and accusing him of resigning it under false pretenses, and many more serious accusations.<ref name=\"Steiner\"/>\n\n[[File:Morgan Lewis (portrait by Henry Inman).png|thumb|right|[[Morgan Lewis (governor)|Morgan Lewis]], endorsed by Hamilton, defeated Burr in the 1804 New York gubernatorial election.]]\n\nIt became clear that Jefferson would drop Burr from his ticket in the 1804 election, so the Vice President ran for the governorship of New York instead.{{citation needed|date = January 2017}} Hamilton campaigned vigorously against Burr, who was running as an independent, causing him to lose to [[Morgan Lewis (governor)|Morgan Lewis]], a Democratic-Republican endorsed by Hamilton.{{Citation needed|date = January 2017}}\n\nBoth men had been involved in duels in the past. Hamilton had been the second in several duels, although never the duelist himself, but he was involved in more than a dozen affairs of honor<ref>{{cite book |last1=Freeman |first1=Joanne B. |title=Affairs of Honor: National Politics in the New Republic |date=2002 |publisher=Yale University Press |page=326-327}}</ref> prior to his fatal encounter with Burr, including disputes with [[William Gordon (New Hampshire politician)|William Gordon]] (1779), [[Aedanus Burke]] (1790), [[John Francis Mercer]] (1792\u20131793), [[James Nicholson (naval officer)|James Nicholson]] (1795), [[James Monroe]] (1797), and Ebenezer Purdy and [[George Clinton (vice president)|George Clinton]] (1804). He also served as a second to [[John Laurens]] in a 1779 duel with General [[Charles Lee (general)|Charles Lee]], and to legal client John Auldjo in a 1787 duel with [[William Pierce (politician)|William Pierce]].<ref>Freeman, 1996, pp. 294\u2013295.</ref> Hamilton also claimed that he had one previous honor dispute with Burr,<ref>Nathaniel Pendleton to Van Ness.

''Papers of Aaron Burr'', 2: 887.</ref><ref>Additionally, Hamilton's son [[Philip Hamilton|Philip]] was killed in a November 23, 1801, duel with George I. Eacker, initiated after Philip and his friend Richard Price engaged in \"hooliganish\" behavior in Eacker's box at the [[Park Theatre (Manhattan, New York)]]. This was in response to a speech which Eacker had made on July 3, 1801, that was critical of Hamilton. Philip and his friend both challenged Eacker to duels when he called them \"damned rascals\" (Fleming, 1999, pp. 7\u20139). Price's duel (also at Weehawken) resulted in nothing more than four missed shots, and Hamilton advised his son to ''delope'' (throw away his shot). However, both Philip and Eacker stood shotless for a minute after the command \"present\", then Philip leveled his pistol, causing Eacker to fire, mortally wounding Philip and sending his shot awry.</ref>\n\n===Election of 1800===\n{{main|United States presidential election, 1800}}\n\nBurr and Hamilton first came into public opposition during the United States presidential election of 1800. Burr ran for Vice President on the Democratic-Republican ticket, along with Thomas Jefferson, against President John Adams (the Federalist incumbent) and his vice presidential running mate [[Charles Cotesworth Pinckney|Charles C. Pinckney]]. Electoral College rules at the time gave each elector two votes for president. The candidate who received the second most votes became vice president.\n\nThe Democratic-Republican Party planned to have 72 of their 73 electors vote for both Jefferson and Burr, with the remaining elector voting only for Jefferson. The electors failed to execute this plan, so Burr and Jefferson were tied with 73 votes each. The Constitution stipulates that if no candidate wins a majority, the election is moved to the House of Representatives\u2014which was controlled by the Federalists, at this point, many of whom were loath to vote for Jefferson. Hamilton regarded Burr as far more dangerous than Jefferson and used all his influence to ensure Jefferson's election. On the 36th ballot, the House of Representatives gave Jefferson the presidency, with Burr becoming Vice President.\n\n===Charles Cooper's letter===\n{{Wikisourcehas|original texts related to|[[s:Hamilton-Burr duel correspondences|Hamilton\u2013Burr duel correspondences]]}}\nOn April 24, 1804, the ''Albany Register'' published a letter opposing Burr's candidacy<ref>Cooper, Charles D.

Van Ness which pointed particularly to the phrase \"more despicable\" and demanded \"a prompt and unqualified acknowledgment or denial of the use of any expression which would warrant the assertion of Dr. Cooper.\" Hamilton's verbose reply on June 20, 1804, indicated that he could not be held responsible for Cooper's interpretation of his words (yet he did not fault that interpretation), concluding that he would \"abide the consequences\" should Burr remain unsatisfied.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Hamilton/01-26-02-0001-0205 |title=From Alexander Hamilton to Aaron Burr, 20 June 1804 |website=Founders.archives.gov |date=June 29, 2016 |accessdate=July 9, 2016}}</ref> A recurring theme in their correspondence is that Burr seeks avowal or disavowal of ''anything'' that could justify Cooper's characterization, while Hamilton protests that there are no ''specifics''.\n\nBurr replied on June 21, 1804, also delivered by Van Ness, stating that \"political opposition can never absolve gentlemen from the necessity of a rigid adherence to the laws of honor and the rules of decorum\".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Hamilton/01-26-02-0001-0207 |title=To Alexander Hamilton from Aaron Burr, 21 June 1804 |website=Founders.archives.gov |date=June 29, 2016 |accessdate=July 9, 2016}}</ref> Hamilton replied that he had \"no other answer to give than that which has already been given\".

General Hamilton cannot recollect distinctly the particulars of that conversation, so as to undertake to repeat them, without running the risk of varying or omitting what might be deemed important circumstances. The expressions are entirely forgotten, and the specific ideas imperfectly remembered; but to the best of his recollection it consisted of comments on the political principles and views of Colonel Burr, and the results that might be expected from them in the event of his election as Governor, without reference to any particular instance of past conduct or private character.<ref>Winfield, 1875, pp. 216\u2013217.</ref>}}\n\nEventually, Burr issued a formal challenge and Hamilton accepted.<ref>Winfield, 1875, p. 217.</ref> Many historians have considered the causes of the duel to be flimsy and have thus characterized Hamilton as \"suicidal\", Burr as \"malicious and murderous\", or both.<ref>Freeman, 1996, p. 290.</ref> Thomas Fleming offers the theory that Burr may have been attempting to recover his honor by challenging Hamilton, whom he considered to be the only gentleman among his detractors, in response to the slanderous attacks against his character published during the 1804 gubernatorial campaign.<ref>Fleming, p. 281</ref>\n\nHamilton's reasons for not engaging in a duel included his roles as father and husband, putting his creditors at risk, and placing his family's welfare in jeopardy, but he felt that it would be impossible to avoid a duel because he had made attacks on Burr which he was unable to recant, and because of Burr's behavior prior to the duel. He attempted to reconcile his moral and religious reasons and the codes of honor and politics. Joanne Freeman speculates that Hamilton intended to accept the duel and throw away his shot in order to satisfy his moral and political codes.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Dueling as Politics: Reinterpreting the Burr\u2013Hamilton Duel|last=Freeman|first=Joanne|year=1996|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\n==The duel==\n[[File:Duel between Aaron Burr and Alexander Hamilton.jpg|thumb|left|Artistic impression of Burr's shot]]\nIn the early morning of July 11, 1804, Burr and Hamilton departed from Manhattan by separate boats and rowed across the [[Hudson River]] to a spot known as the Heights of [[Weehawken, New Jersey]], a popular dueling ground below the towering cliffs of the [[New Jersey Palisades]].<ref name=\"teachinghistory\">Buescher, John. \"[http://teachinghistory.org/history-content/ask-a-historian/24404 Burr\u2013Hamilton Duel].\" [http://www.teachinghistory.org Teachinghistory.org]. Accessed July 11, 2011.</ref> Dueling had been prohibited in both New York and New Jersey, but Hamilton and Burr agreed to go to Weehawken because New Jersey was not as aggressive as New York in prosecuting dueling participants. The same site was used for 18 known duels between 1700 and 1845, including the 1801 duel that killed Hamilton's eldest son [[Philip Hamilton]].<ref>Demontreux, 2004, p. 3.</ref> They also took steps to give all witnesses plausible deniability in an attempt to shield themselves from prosecution. For example, the pistols were transported to the island in a portmanteau, enabling the rowers to say under oath that they had not seen any pistols. They also stood with their backs to the duelists.<ref>Chernow, p. 700.</ref>\n\nBurr, [[William Peter Van Ness]] (his [[second (duel)|second]]), Matthew L. Davis, another man (often identified as John Swarthout), and the rowers all reached the site at 6:30&nbsp;a.m., whereupon Swarthout and Van Ness started to clear the underbrush from the dueling ground. Hamilton, Judge [[Nathaniel Pendleton]] (his second), and [[David Hosack]] arrived a few minutes before seven. Lots were cast for the choice of position and which second should start the duel. Both were won by Hamilton's second, who chose the upper edge of the ledge for Hamilton, facing the city.<ref name=\"Winfield 219\">Winfield, 1874, p. 219.</ref> However, [[Joseph Ellis]] claims that Hamilton had been challenged and therefore had choice of both weapon and position. Under this account, it was Hamilton himself who chose the upstream or north side position.<ref name=\"Ellis 24\">Ellis, Joseph. Founding Brothers. p. 24</ref>\n\nAll first-hand accounts of the duel agree that two shots were fired, although the seconds disagreed on the intervening time between them. It was common for both principals in a duel to fire a shot at the ground to exemplify courage, and then the duel could come to an end. Hamilton apparently fired a shot above Burr's head. Burr returned fire and hit Hamilton in the lower abdomen above the right hip.<ref name=\"Winfield, 1874, pp. 219\u2013220\">Winfield, 1874, pp. 219\u2013220.</ref> The large-caliber lead ball ricocheted off Hamilton's third or second [[False ribs|false rib]], fracturing it and causing considerable damage to his internal organs, particularly his liver and diaphragm, before lodging in his first or second [[lumbar vertebra]]. According to Pendleton's account, Hamilton collapsed almost immediately, dropping the pistol involuntarily, and Burr moved toward him in a speechless manner (which Pendleton deemed to be indicative of regret) before being hustled away behind an umbrella by Van Ness because Hosack and the rowers were already approaching.<ref name=\"Winfield, 1874, pp. 219\u2013220\"/>\n\nIt is entirely uncertain which principal fired first, as both seconds' backs were to the duel in accordance with the pre-arranged regulations so that they could testify that they \"saw no fire\". After much research to determine the actual events of the duel, historian Joseph Ellis gives his best guess:\n\n{{quote|Hamilton did fire his weapon intentionally, and he fired first. But he aimed to miss Burr, sending his ball into the tree above and behind Burr's location. In so doing, he did not withhold his shot, but he did waste it, thereby honoring his pre-duel pledge. Meanwhile, Burr, who did not know about the pledge, did know that a projectile from Hamilton's gun had whizzed past him and crashed into the tree to his rear. According to the principles of the [[code duello]], Burr was perfectly justified in taking deadly aim at Hamilton and firing to kill.}}\n\n===David Hosack's account===\nHosack wrote his account on August 17, about one month after the duel had taken place. He testified that he had only seen Hamilton and the two seconds disappear \"into the wood\", heard two shots, and rushed to find a wounded Hamilton. He also testified that he had not seen Burr, who had been hidden behind an umbrella by Van Ness.<ref>''William P. Van Ness vs. The People''. 1805.</ref> He gives a very clear picture of the events in a letter to [[William Coleman (editor)|William Coleman]]:\n\n{{quote|When called to him upon his receiving the fatal wound, I found him half sitting on the ground, supported in the arms of Mr. Pendleton. His countenance of death I shall never forget. He had at that instant just strength to say, \"This is a mortal wound, doctor;\" when he sunk away, and became to all appearance lifeless. I immediately stripped up his clothes, and soon, alas I ascertained that the direction of the ball must have been through some vital part. His pulses were not to be felt, his respiration was entirely suspended, and, upon laying my hand on his heart and perceiving no motion there, I considered him as irrecoverably gone. I, however, observed to Mr. Pendleton, that the only chance for his reviving was immediately to get him upon the water. We therefore lifted him up, and carried him out of the wood to the margin of the bank, where the bargemen aided us in conveying him into the boat, which immediately put off. During all this time I could not discover the least symptom of returning life. I now rubbed his face, lips, and temples with [[spirits of hartshorn]], applied it to his neck and breast, and to the wrists and palms of his hands, and endeavoured to pour some into his mouth.<ref name=\"Hosack Coleman\">Dr. David Hosack to William Coleman, August 17, 1804</ref>}}\n\nHosack goes on to say that Hamilton had revived after a few minutes, either from the hartshorn or fresh air. He finishes his letter:\n\n{{quote|Soon after recovering his sight, he happened to cast his eye upon the case of pistols, and observing the one that he had had in his hand lying on the outside, he said, \"Take care of that pistol; it is undischarged, and still cocked; it may go off and do harm. Pendleton knows\" (attempting to turn his head towards him) \"that I did not intend to fire at him.\" \"Yes,\" said Mr. Pendleton, understanding his wish, \"I have already made Dr. Hosack acquainted with your determination as to that.\" He then closed his eyes and remained calm, without any disposition to speak; nor did he say much afterward, except in reply to my questions. He asked me once or twice how I found his pulse; and he informed me that his lower extremities had lost all feeling, manifesting to me that he entertained no hopes that he should long survive.<ref name=\"Hosack Coleman\" />}}\n\n===Statement to the press===\nPendleton and Van Ness issued a press statement about the events of the duel which pointed out the agreed-upon dueling rules and events that transpired. It stated that both participants were free to open fire once they had been given the order to present. After first fire had been given, the opponent's second would count to three, whereupon the opponent would fire or sacrifice his shot.<ref name=\"URL\">{{cite web |url=http://odur.let.rug.nl/~usa/B/hamilton/hamil43.htm |title=Document: Joint statement on the Duel < A Biography of Alexander Hamilton (1755\u20131804) < Biographies < American History From Revolution To Reconstruction and beyond |website=Odur.let.rug.nl |accessdate=July 9, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402062544/http://odur.let.rug.nl/%7Eusa/B/hamilton/hamil43.htm |archive-date=April 2, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Pendleton and Van Ness disagree as to who fired the first shot, but they concur that both men had fired \"within a few seconds of each other\" (as they must have; neither Pendleton nor Van Ness mentions counting down).<ref name=\"URL\" />\n\nIn Pendleton's amended version of the statement, he and a friend went to the site of the duel the day after Hamilton's death to discover where Hamilton's shot went. The statement reads: \n\n<blockquote>They ascertained that the ball passed through the limb of a cedar tree, at an elevation of about twelve feet and a half, perpendicularly from the ground, between thirteen and fourteen feet from the mark on which General Hamilton stood, and about four feet wide of the direct line between him and Col.

See Freeman, 1996, note 1.</ref> in which he stated that he was \"strongly opposed to the practice of dueling\" for both religious and practical reasons. \"I have resolved,\" it continued, \"if our interview is conducted in the usual manner, and it pleases God to give me the opportunity, to reserve and throw away my first fire, and I have thoughts even of reserving my second fire.\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Hamilton|first1=Alexander|title=Statement on Impending Duel with Aaron Burr, (28 June \u2013 10 July 1804)|url=https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Hamilton/01-26-02-0001-0241|website=Founders Online}}</ref><ref>Hamilton, 1804, 26:278.</ref>\n\nHamilton regained consciousness after being shot and told Dr. Hosack that his gun was still loaded and that \"Pendleton knows I did not mean to fire at him.\" This is evidence for the theory that Hamilton intended not to fire, honoring his pre-duel pledge, and only fired accidentally upon being hit.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Such an intention would have violated the protocol of the ''code duello'' and, when Burr learned of it, he responded: \"Contemptible, if true.\"<ref>Joseph Wheelan, ''Jefferson's Vendetta: The Pursuit of Aaron Burr and the Judiciary'', New York, Carroll & Graf Publishers, 2005, {{ISBN|0-7867-1437-9}}, p. 90</ref> Hamilton could have thrown away his shot by firing into the ground, thus possibly signaling Burr of his purpose.\n\nModern historians have debated to what extent Hamilton's statements and letter represent his true beliefs, and how much of this was a deliberate attempt to permanently ruin Burr if Hamilton were killed. An example of this may be seen in what one historian has considered to be deliberate attempts to provoke Burr on the dueling ground:\n\n{{quote|Hamilton performed a series of deliberately provocative actions to ensure a lethal outcome.

In the attachment to that letter, Hamilton argued against Burr's character on numerous scores: he suspected Burr \"on strong grounds of having corruptly served the views of the Holland Company\"; \"his very friends do not insist on his integrity\"; \"he will court and employ able and daring scoundrels\"; he seeks \"Supreme power in his own person\" and \"will in all likelihood attempt a usurpation\", and so forth.<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YbnPAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA251 |title=The Century Illustrated Monthly Magazine |accessdate=April 20, 2015|year=1900 }}</ref>\n\n===Pistols===\n[[File:Hamilton-Burr pistols.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Wogdon & Barton]] pistols used in the duel]]\n[[File:Philip Hamilton.jpg|thumb|right|[[Philip Hamilton]] was killed in a duel three years before, near the spot of the Burr\u2013Hamilton duel.]]\nThe pistols used in the duel belonged to Hamilton's brother-in-law [[John Barker Church]], who was a business partner of both Hamilton and Burr.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.aaronburrassociation.org/duel%20description.htm|title=The two boats rowed back to New York City|website=www.aaronburrassociation.org|access-date=March 27, 2018}}</ref> Later legend claimed that these pistols were the same ones used in a 1799 duel between Church and Burr in which neither man was injured.<ref name=Lindsay>{{cite journal |last1=Lindsay |first1=Merrill |title=Pistols Shed Light on Famed Duel |journal=Smithsonian |date=November 1976 |pages=94\u201398 |url=http://www.aaronburrassociation.org/Smithsonian.htm}}</ref><ref name=\"auto1\">Alexander Hamilton, by Ron Chernow, p. 590</ref> Burr, however, wrote in his memoirs that he supplied the pistols for his duel with Church, and that they belonged to him.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Burr|first1=Aaron|last2=Davis|first2=Matthew Livingston|title=Memoirs of Aaron Burr: With Miscellaneous Selections from His Correspondence, Volume 1|date=1837|publisher=Harper & Brothers|page=417|url=https://books.google.com/?id=il4SAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA417|accessdate=February 11, 2016}}</ref><ref name=\"auto1\"/>\n\nThe [[Wogdon & Barton]] dueling pistols incorporated a [[wiktionary:hair-trigger|hair-trigger]] feature that could be set by the user.<ref name=Lindsay/><ref>For the [[United States Bicentennial]] in 1976, Chase Manhattan allowed the pistols to be removed and lent to the U.S. Bicentennial Society of Richmond.

In 1806, [[Lyman Beecher]] delivered an anti-dueling sermon, later reprinted in 1809 by the Anti-Dueling Association of New York.

The musical compresses the timeline for Burr and Hamilton's grievance, depicting Burr's challenge as a result of Hamilton's endorsement of Jefferson rather than the gubernatorial election. In ''Hamilton'', the duel is the penultimate scene, before the show's finale is sung. The result is the same, but Hamilton's actions are different: he aims his pistol at the sky, but it is too late and Burr has fired his shot.\n\nDescendants of Burr and Hamilton held a re-enactment of the duel near the Hudson River for the duel's bicentennial in 2004.

It occurred early in the morning of July 11, 1804,<ref>{{cite web |url= http://memory.loc.gov/ammem/today/jul11.html |title=Today in History: July 11 |publisher=Library of Congress |accessdate=April 23, 2007}}</ref> and was the culmination of a long and bitter rivalry between the two men. Vice President Burr shot Hamilton, while Hamilton's shot broke a tree branch directly above Burr's head. Hamilton was carried to the home of [[William Bayard Jr.]] where he died the next day.\n\n==Background==\n[[File:Schuyler.jpg|thumb|[[Philip Schuyler]], Hamilton's father in law.]] \nThe Burr\u2013Hamilton duel is one of the most famous personal conflicts in American history. It was a pistol duel which arose from long-standing personal bitterness that developed between the two men over the course of several years. Tension rose with Hamilton's journalistic defamation of Burr's character during the 1804 New York gubernatorial race, in which Burr was a candidate.\n\nThe duel was fought at a time when the practice was being outlawed in the northern United States, and it had immense political ramifications. Burr survived the duel and was indicted for murder in both [[New York (state)|New York]] and [[New Jersey]], though these charges were later either dismissed or resulted in acquittal. The harsh criticism and animosity directed toward him following the duel brought an end to his political career. The [[Federalist Party]] was already weakened by the defeat of [[John Adams]] in the presidential election of 1800 and was further weakened by Hamilton's death.\n\nThe duel was the final skirmish of a long conflict between [[Democratic-Republican Party|Democratic-Republicans]] and Federalists. The conflict began in 1791 when Burr won a United States Senate seat from [[Philip Schuyler]], Hamilton's father-in-law, who would have supported Federalist policies. (Hamilton was the Secretary of the Treasury at the time.) The [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] then deadlocked in the election of 1800, during which Hamilton's maneuvering in the House of Representatives caused [[Thomas Jefferson]] to be named president and Burr vice-president.<ref>See, for example, ''[http://www.gilderlehrman.org/history-by-era/early-republic/resources/%E2%80%9Cjefferson-every-view-less-dangerous-burr%E2%80%9D-hamilton-election \"Jefferson is in every view less dangerous than Burr\": Hamilton on the election of 1800]'' (Letter from Alexander Hamilton to Harrison Gray Otis: December 23, 1800).</ref>\n\nHamilton's animosity toward Burr was severe and well-documented in personal letters to his friend and compatriot [[James McHenry]]. The following quotation from one of these letters on January 4, 1801, exemplifies his bitterness:\n\n<blockquote>Nothing has given me so much chagrin as the Intelligence that the Federal party were thinking seriously of supporting Mr. Burr for president.  I should consider the execution of the plan as [[wikt:devote#3|devoting]] the country and signing their own death warrant.  Mr. Burr will probably make stipulations, but he will laugh in his sleeve while he makes them and will break them the first moment it may serve his purpose.<ref name=\"Steiner\">Bernard C. Steiner and James McHenry, ''[https://archive.org/details/lifeandcorrespo02steigoog The life and correspondence of James McHenry]'' (Cleveland: Burrows Brothers Co., 1907).</ref></blockquote>\n\nHamilton details the many charges that he has against Burr in a more extensive letter written shortly afterward, calling him a \"profligate, a voluptuary in the extreme\", accusing him of corruptly serving the interests of the [[Holland Land Company]] while a member of the legislature, criticizing his military commission and accusing him of resigning it under false pretenses, and many more serious accusations.<ref name=\"Steiner\"/>\n\n[[File:Morgan Lewis (portrait by Henry Inman).png|thumb|right|[[Morgan Lewis (governor)|Morgan Lewis]], endorsed by Hamilton, defeated Burr in the 1804 New York gubernatorial election.]]\n\nIt became clear that Jefferson would drop Burr from his ticket in the 1804 election, so the Vice President ran for the governorship of New York instead.{{citation needed|date = January 2017}} Hamilton campaigned vigorously against Burr, who was running as an independent, causing him to lose to [[Morgan Lewis (governor)|Morgan Lewis]], a Democratic-Republican endorsed by Hamilton.{{Citation needed|date = January 2017}}\n\nBoth men had been involved in duels in the past.

Eacker, initiated after Philip and his friend Richard Price engaged in \"hooliganish\" behavior in Eacker's box at the [[Park Theatre (Manhattan, New York)]]. This was in response to a speech which Eacker had made on July 3, 1801, that was critical of Hamilton. Philip and his friend both challenged Eacker to duels when he called them \"damned rascals\" (Fleming, 1999, pp. 7\u20139). Price's duel (also at Weehawken) resulted in nothing more than four missed shots, and Hamilton advised his son to ''delope'' (throw away his shot). However, both Philip and Eacker stood shotless for a minute after the command \"present\", then Philip leveled his pistol, causing Eacker to fire, mortally wounding Philip and sending his shot awry.</ref>\n\n===Election of 1800===\n{{main|United States presidential election, 1800}}\n\nBurr and Hamilton first came into public opposition during the United States presidential election of 1800. Burr ran for Vice President on the Democratic-Republican ticket, along with Thomas Jefferson, against President John Adams (the Federalist incumbent) and his vice presidential running mate [[Charles Cotesworth Pinckney|Charles C. Pinckney]]. Electoral College rules at the time gave each elector two votes for president. The candidate who received the second most votes became vice president.\n\nThe Democratic-Republican Party planned to have 72 of their 73 electors vote for both Jefferson and Burr, with the remaining elector voting only for Jefferson. The electors failed to execute this plan, so Burr and Jefferson were tied with 73 votes each. The Constitution stipulates that if no candidate wins a majority, the election is moved to the House of Representatives\u2014which was controlled by the Federalists, at this point, many of whom were loath to vote for Jefferson. Hamilton regarded Burr as far more dangerous than Jefferson and used all his influence to ensure Jefferson's election. On the 36th ballot, the House of Representatives gave Jefferson the presidency, with Burr becoming Vice President.\n\n===Charles Cooper's letter===\n{{Wikisourcehas|original texts related to|[[s:Hamilton-Burr duel correspondences|Hamilton\u2013Burr duel correspondences]]}}\nOn April 24, 1804, the ''Albany Register'' published a letter opposing Burr's candidacy<ref>Cooper, Charles D.

General Hamilton cannot recollect distinctly the particulars of that conversation, so as to undertake to repeat them, without running the risk of varying or omitting what might be deemed important circumstances. The expressions are entirely forgotten, and the specific ideas imperfectly remembered; but to the best of his recollection it consisted of comments on the political principles and views of Colonel Burr, and the results that might be expected from them in the event of his election as Governor, without reference to any particular instance of past conduct or private character.<ref>Winfield, 1875, pp. 216\u2013217.</ref>}}\n\nEventually, Burr issued a formal challenge and Hamilton accepted.<ref>Winfield, 1875, p. 217.</ref> Many historians have considered the causes of the duel to be flimsy and have thus characterized Hamilton as \"suicidal\", Burr as \"malicious and murderous\", or both.<ref>Freeman, 1996, p. 290.</ref> Thomas Fleming offers the theory that Burr may have been attempting to recover his honor by challenging Hamilton, whom he considered to be the only gentleman among his detractors, in response to the slanderous attacks against his character published during the 1804 gubernatorial campaign.<ref>Fleming, p. 281</ref>\n\nHamilton's reasons for not engaging in a duel included his roles as father and husband, putting his creditors at risk, and placing his family's welfare in jeopardy, but he felt that it would be impossible to avoid a duel because he had made attacks on Burr which he was unable to recant, and because of Burr's behavior prior to the duel. He attempted to reconcile his moral and religious reasons and the codes of honor and politics. Joanne Freeman speculates that Hamilton intended to accept the duel and throw away his shot in order to satisfy his moral and political codes.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Dueling as Politics: Reinterpreting the Burr\u2013Hamilton Duel|last=Freeman|first=Joanne|year=1996|isbn=|location=|pages=}}</ref>\n\n==The duel==\n[[File:Duel between Aaron Burr and Alexander Hamilton.jpg|thumb|left|Artistic impression of Burr's shot]]\nIn the early morning of July 11, 1804, Burr and Hamilton departed from Manhattan by separate boats and rowed across the [[Hudson River]] to a spot known as the Heights of [[Weehawken, New Jersey]], a popular dueling ground below the towering cliffs of the [[New Jersey Palisades]].<ref name=\"teachinghistory\">Buescher, John. \"[http://teachinghistory.org/history-content/ask-a-historian/24404 Burr\u2013Hamilton Duel].\" [http://www.teachinghistory.org Teachinghistory.org]. Accessed July 11, 2011.</ref> Dueling had been prohibited in both New York and New Jersey, but Hamilton and Burr agreed to go to Weehawken because New Jersey was not as aggressive as New York in prosecuting dueling participants. The same site was used for 18 known duels between 1700 and 1845, including the 1801 duel that killed Hamilton's eldest son [[Philip Hamilton]].<ref>Demontreux, 2004, p. 3.</ref> They also took steps to give all witnesses plausible deniability in an attempt to shield themselves from prosecution. For example, the pistols were transported to the island in a portmanteau, enabling the rowers to say under oath that they had not seen any pistols. They also stood with their backs to the duelists.<ref>Chernow, p. 700.</ref>\n\nBurr, [[William Peter Van Ness]] (his [[second (duel)|second]]), Matthew L. Davis, another man (often identified as John Swarthout), and the rowers all reached the site at 6:30&nbsp;a.m., whereupon Swarthout and Van Ness started to clear the underbrush from the dueling ground. Hamilton, Judge [[Nathaniel Pendleton]] (his second), and [[David Hosack]] arrived a few minutes before seven. Lots were cast for the choice of position and which second should start the duel. Both were won by Hamilton's second, who chose the upper edge of the ledge for Hamilton, facing the city.<ref name=\"Winfield 219\">Winfield, 1874, p. 219.</ref> However, [[Joseph Ellis]] claims that Hamilton had been challenged and therefore had choice of both weapon and position. Under this account, it was Hamilton himself who chose the upstream or north side position.<ref name=\"Ellis 24\">Ellis, Joseph. Founding Brothers. p. 24</ref>\n\nAll first-hand accounts of the duel agree that two shots were fired, although the seconds disagreed on the intervening time between them. It was common for both principals in a duel to fire a shot at the ground to exemplify courage, and then the duel could come to an end. Hamilton apparently fired a shot above Burr's head. Burr returned fire and hit Hamilton in the lower abdomen above the right hip.<ref name=\"Winfield, 1874, pp. 219\u2013220\">Winfield, 1874, pp. 219\u2013220.</ref> The large-caliber lead ball ricocheted off Hamilton's third or second [[False ribs|false rib]], fracturing it and causing considerable damage to his internal organs, particularly his liver and diaphragm, before lodging in his first or second [[lumbar vertebra]]. According to Pendleton's account, Hamilton collapsed almost immediately, dropping the pistol involuntarily, and Burr moved toward him in a speechless manner (which Pendleton deemed to be indicative of regret) before being hustled away behind an umbrella by Van Ness because Hosack and the rowers were already approaching.<ref name=\"Winfield, 1874, pp. 219\u2013220\"/>\n\nIt is entirely uncertain which principal fired first, as both seconds' backs were to the duel in accordance with the pre-arranged regulations so that they could testify that they \"saw no fire\". After much research to determine the actual events of the duel, historian Joseph Ellis gives his best guess:\n\n{{quote|Hamilton did fire his weapon intentionally, and he fired first. But he aimed to miss Burr, sending his ball into the tree above and behind Burr's location. In so doing, he did not withhold his shot, but he did waste it, thereby honoring his pre-duel pledge. Meanwhile, Burr, who did not know about the pledge, did know that a projectile from Hamilton's gun had whizzed past him and crashed into the tree to his rear. According to the principles of the [[code duello]], Burr was perfectly justified in taking deadly aim at Hamilton and firing to kill.}}\n\n===David Hosack's account===\nHosack wrote his account on August 17, about one month after the duel had taken place. He testified that he had only seen Hamilton and the two seconds disappear \"into the wood\", heard two shots, and rushed to find a wounded Hamilton. He also testified that he had not seen Burr, who had been hidden behind an umbrella by Van Ness.<ref>''William P. Van Ness vs. The People''. 1805.</ref> He gives a very clear picture of the events in a letter to [[William Coleman (editor)|William Coleman]]:\n\n{{quote|When called to him upon his receiving the fatal wound, I found him half sitting on the ground, supported in the arms of Mr. Pendleton. His countenance of death I shall never forget. He had at that instant just strength to say, \"This is a mortal wound, doctor;\" when he sunk away, and became to all appearance lifeless. I immediately stripped up his clothes, and soon, alas I ascertained that the direction of the ball must have been through some vital part. His pulses were not to be felt, his respiration was entirely suspended, and, upon laying my hand on his heart and perceiving no motion there, I considered him as irrecoverably gone. I, however, observed to Mr. Pendleton, that the only chance for his reviving was immediately to get him upon the water. We therefore lifted him up, and carried him out of the wood to the margin of the bank, where the bargemen aided us in conveying him into the boat, which immediately put off. During all this time I could not discover the least symptom of returning life. I now rubbed his face, lips, and temples with [[spirits of hartshorn]], applied it to his neck and breast, and to the wrists and palms of his hands, and endeavoured to pour some into his mouth.<ref name=\"Hosack Coleman\">Dr. David Hosack to William Coleman, August 17, 1804</ref>}}\n\nHosack goes on to say that Hamilton had revived after a few minutes, either from the hartshorn or fresh air. He finishes his letter:\n\n{{quote|Soon after recovering his sight, he happened to cast his eye upon the case of pistols, and observing the one that he had had in his hand lying on the outside, he said, \"Take care of that pistol; it is undischarged, and still cocked; it may go off and do harm. Pendleton knows\" (attempting to turn his head towards him) \"that I did not intend to fire at him.\" \"Yes,\" said Mr. Pendleton, understanding his wish, \"I have already made Dr. Hosack acquainted with your determination as to that.\" He then closed his eyes and remained calm, without any disposition to speak; nor did he say much afterward, except in reply to my questions. He asked me once or twice how I found his pulse; and he informed me that his lower extremities had lost all feeling, manifesting to me that he entertained no hopes that he should long survive.<ref name=\"Hosack Coleman\" />}}\n\n===Statement to the press===\nPendleton and Van Ness issued a press statement about the events of the duel which pointed out the agreed-upon dueling rules and events that transpired. It stated that both participants were free to open fire once they had been given the order to present. After first fire had been given, the opponent's second would count to three, whereupon the opponent would fire or sacrifice his shot.<ref name=\"URL\">{{cite web |url=http://odur.let.rug.nl/~usa/B/hamilton/hamil43.htm |title=Document: Joint statement on the Duel < A Biography of Alexander Hamilton (1755\u20131804) < Biographies < American History From Revolution To Reconstruction and beyond |website=Odur.let.rug.nl |accessdate=July 9, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402062544/http://odur.let.rug.nl/%7Eusa/B/hamilton/hamil43.htm |archive-date=April 2, 2012 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Pendleton and Van Ness disagree as to who fired the first shot, but they concur that both men had fired \"within a few seconds of each other\" (as they must have; neither Pendleton nor Van Ness mentions counting down).<ref name=\"URL\" />\n\nIn Pendleton's amended version of the statement, he and a friend went to the site of the duel the day after Hamilton's death to discover where Hamilton's shot went. The statement reads: \n\n<blockquote>They ascertained that the ball passed through the limb of a cedar tree, at an elevation of about twelve feet and a half, perpendicularly from the ground, between thirteen and fourteen feet from the mark on which General Hamilton stood, and about four feet wide of the direct line between him and Col.

See Freeman, 1996, note 1.</ref> in which he stated that he was \"strongly opposed to the practice of dueling\" for both religious and practical reasons. \"I have resolved,\" it continued, \"if our interview is conducted in the usual manner, and it pleases God to give me the opportunity, to reserve and throw away my first fire, and I have thoughts even of reserving my second fire.\"<ref>{{cite web|last1=Hamilton|first1=Alexander|title=Statement on Impending Duel with Aaron Burr, (28 June \u2013 10 July 1804)|url=https://founders.archives.gov/documents/Hamilton/01-26-02-0001-0241|website=Founders Online}}</ref><ref>Hamilton, 1804, 26:278.</ref>\n\nHamilton regained consciousness after being shot and told Dr. Hosack that his gun was still loaded and that \"Pendleton knows I did not mean to fire at him.\" This is evidence for the theory that Hamilton intended not to fire, honoring his pre-duel pledge, and only fired accidentally upon being hit.<ref name=\"ReferenceA\"/> Such an intention would have violated the protocol of the ''code duello'' and, when Burr learned of it, he responded: \"Contemptible, if true.\"<ref>Joseph Wheelan, ''Jefferson's Vendetta: The Pursuit of Aaron Burr and the Judiciary'', New York, Carroll & Graf Publishers, 2005, {{ISBN|0-7867-1437-9}}, p. 90</ref> Hamilton could have thrown away his shot by firing into the ground, thus possibly signaling Burr of his purpose.\n\nModern historians have debated to what extent Hamilton's statements and letter represent his true beliefs, and how much of this was a deliberate attempt to permanently ruin Burr if Hamilton were killed. An example of this may be seen in what one historian has considered to be deliberate attempts to provoke Burr on the dueling ground:\n\n{{quote|Hamilton performed a series of deliberately provocative actions to ensure a lethal outcome.

He finally returned to New York City in 1812, where he resumed his law practice and spent the remainder of his life in relative obscurity.\n\n===Monuments===\n[[File:HamiltonRestingRock.jpg|right|thumb|150px|The boulder where Hamilton may have rested]]\n[[File:HamiltonBust.jpg|right|thumb|150px|A bust of Hamilton from 1935]]\nThe first memorial to the duel was constructed in 1806 by the [[Saint Andrew's Society of the State of New York]] of which Hamilton was a member.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.standrewsny.org/NotedMembers|website=St. Andrew's Society of New York|title=Noted Members|access-date=September 28, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150911102946/http://www.standrewsny.org/NotedMembers|archive-date=September 11, 2015|url-status=dead|df=mdy-all}}</ref> A 14-foot marble [[cenotaph]] was constructed where Hamilton was believed to have fallen, consisting of an [[obelisk]] topped by a flaming urn and a plaque with a quotation from [[Horace]], the whole structure surrounded by an iron fence.<ref>Demontreux, 2004, pp. 3\u20134.</ref> Duels continued to be fought at the site and the marble was slowly vandalized and removed for souvenirs, with nothing remaining by 1820. The memorial's plaque survived, however, turning up in a junk store and finding its way to the [[New-York Historical Society]] in Manhattan where it still resides.<ref>Demontreux, 2004, p. 4.</ref>\n\nFrom 1820 to 1857, the site was marked by two stones with the names Hamilton and Burr placed where they were thought to have stood during the duel, but a road was built through the site in 1858 from [[Hoboken, New Jersey]], to [[Fort Lee, New Jersey]]; all that remained of those memorials was an inscription on a boulder where Hamilton was thought to have rested after the duel, but there are no primary accounts which confirm the boulder anecdote. Railroad tracks were laid directly through the site in 1870, and the boulder was hauled to the top of the Palisades where it remains today.<ref>Demontreux, 2004, p. 5.</ref> An iron fence was built around it in 1874, supplemented by a bust of Hamilton and a plaque. The bust was thrown over the cliff on October 14, 1934, by vandals and the head was never recovered; a new bust was installed on July 12, 1935.<ref>Demontreux, 2004, p. 6.</ref> The plaque was stolen by vandals in the 1980s and an abbreviated version of the text was inscribed on the indentation left in the boulder, which remained until the 1990s when a granite pedestal was added in front of the boulder and the bust was moved to the top of the pedestal. New markers were added on July 11, 2004, the 200th anniversary of the duel.<ref>Demontreux, 2004, pp. 7\u20139.</ref>\n\n===Anti-dueling movement in New York state===\nIn the months and years following the duel, a movement started to end the practice. [[Eliphalet Nott]], the pastor at an Albany church attended by Hamilton's father-in-law, [[Philip Schuyler]], gave a sermon that was soon reprinted, \"A Discourse, Delivered in the North Dutch Church, in the City of Albany, Occasioned by the Ever to be Lamented Death of General Alexander Hamilton, July 29, 1804\". In 1806, [[Lyman Beecher]] delivered an anti-dueling sermon, later reprinted in 1809 by the Anti-Dueling Association of New York. The covers and some pages of both pamphlets:\n<gallery perrow=\"5\" widths=\"115px\">\nImage:AntiDuelingPamphletEliphaletNott1804.jpg|1804 Anti-dueling sermon by an acquaintance of [[Alexander Hamilton]]\nImage:EliphaletNottSermonDeathOfAlexanderHamiltonPartialText1809.jpg|Opening text of 1804 sermon\nImage:TheRemedyForDuelingSermonLymanBeecherPamphlet1809.jpg|Anti-Dueling Association of New York pamphlet, ''Remedy'', 1809\nImage:AntiDuelingAssocOfNYResolutions1809.jpg|Resolutions, Anti-Dueling Association of N.Y., from ''Remedy'' pamphlet, 1809\nImage:AntiDuellingAssocOfNYAddressToNY1809.jpg|Address to the electorate, from ''Remedy'' pamphlet\n</gallery>\n\n==In popular culture==\n<!--- NOTE: Please do not list trivial or ephemeral things such as an episode of some TV show or an allusion in some novel, and do not list anything without a reliable source to support it. --->\nThe rules of dueling researched by historian [[Joanne B.

The musical compresses the timeline for Burr and Hamilton's grievance, depicting Burr's challenge as a result of Hamilton's endorsement of Jefferson rather than the gubernatorial election. In ''Hamilton'', the duel is the penultimate scene, before the show's finale is sung. The result is the same, but Hamilton's actions are different: he aims his pistol at the sky, but it is too late and Burr has fired his shot.\n\nDescendants of Burr and Hamilton held a re-enactment of the duel near the Hudson River for the duel's bicentennial in 2004. Douglas Hamilton, fifth great-grandson of Alexander Hamilton, faced Antonio Burr, a descendant of Aaron Burr's cousin. More than 1,000 people attended it, including an estimated 60 descendants of Hamilton and 40 members of the Aaron Burr Association.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/5416375/ns/us_news/t/hamilton-burr-kin-re-enact-famous-fatal-duel/ |title=Hamilton, Burr kin re-enact famous, fatal duel |work=MSNBC |accessdate=April 20, 2015}}</ref> The Alexander Hamilton Awareness Society has been hosting the Celebrate Hamilton program since 2012 to commemorate the Burr\u2013Hamilton Duel and Alexander Hamilton's life and legacy.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Brenzel|first1=Kathryn|title=Burr killed Hamilton 211 years ago during famous duel in Weehawken|url=http://www.nj.com/hudson/index.ssf/2015/07/211_years_ago_burr_killed_hamilton_in_famous_duel.html|website=Nj.com|publisher=NJ Advance Media}}</ref>\n\n==See also==\n* [[List of feuds in the United States]]\n\n==Notes==\n{{Reflist}}\n\n==References==\n* Berg, Al and Sherman, Lauren (2004). \"[https://web.archive.org/web/20070703220534/http://duel2004.weehawkenhistory.org/pistols.pdf Pistols at Weehawken].\" Weehawken Historical Commission.\n* Chernow, Ron (2004).
