The original machine was well ahead of its time and generated a lot of single sales, for labs and research.<ref name=\"Deutschman\" /> However, the system did not sell in quantity.\n\nIn 1987, Pixar redesigned the machine to create the P-II second generation machine, which sold for $30,000.<ref>{{cite book|last=Isaacson|first=Walter | authorlink =Walter Isaacson|title=Steve Jobs|year=2011|isbn= |page=|publisher=[[Simon & Schuster]]|title-link=Steve Jobs (book) }}</ref> In an attempt to gain a foothold in the medical market, Pixar donated ten machines to leading hospitals and sent marketing people to doctors' conventions. However, this had little effect on sales, despite the machine's ability to render [[Computed axial tomography|CAT]] scan data in 3D to show perfect images of the human body. Pixar did get a contract with the manufacturer of CAT Scanners, which sold 30 machines. By 1988 Pixar had only sold 120 Pixar Image Computers.<ref name=\"Deutschman\" />\n\nIn 1988, Pixar began the development of the PII-9, a nine slot version of the low cost P-II. This machine was coupled with a very early [[RAID]] model,<ref>http://www.specktech.com/PixarImageComputer.html</ref> a high performance bus, a hardware image decompression card, 4 processors (called Chaps or channel processors), very large memory cards (VME sized card full of memory), high resolutions video cards with 10-bit [[Digital-to-analog converter|DACs]] which were programmable for a variety of frame rates and resolutions, and finally an overlay board which ran [[NeWS]], and the 9 slot chassis. A full-up system was quite expensive, as the 3 [[Gibibyte|GiB]] RAID was $300,000 alone. At this time in history most file systems could only address 2 GiB of disk. This system was aimed at high-end government imaging applications which were done by dedicated systems produced by the aerospace industry which cost a million dollars a seat. The PII-9 and the associated software became the prototype of the next generation of commercial \"low cost\" workstations.\n\n=== Demise and legacy ===\nIn 1990, the Pixar Image Computer was defining the state-of-the-art in commercial image processing. Despite this, the government decided that the per-seat cost was still too high for mass deployment and to wait for the next generation systems to achieve cost reductions. This decision was the catalyst for Pixar to lay off its hardware engineers and sell the imaging business. There were no high volume buyers in any industry. Fewer than 300 Pixar Image Computers were ever sold.<ref>http://www.ricomputermuseum.org/Home/equipment/pixar-image-computer</ref>\n\n{{quote| text=\"It was built to be part of a pipeline, but as we developed it we realized we were competing with Moore's Law with CPU and we probably couldn't get far enough ahead of it to justify it so we actually stopped the hardware effort.\"| sign=[[Edwin_Catmull|Ed Catmull]] | source=<ref>{{Cite web |url= https://www.fxguide.com/featured/pixars-renderman-turns-25/ |title= Pixar's RenderMan turns 25 |access-date= 2019-04-21}}</ref>}}\n\nThe Pixar computer business was sold to Vicom Systems in 1990 for $2,000,000.

Woodstock is also home to the [[Woodstock River Bandits|River Bandits]] of the [[Valley Baseball League]], the Shenandoah County Public School's Central campus, and the Shenandoah County Fairgrounds.\n\n==History==\nThe town was established by charter in March 1761 as a part of what was then Frederick County. It was originally formed from a land grant from [[Lord Fairfax]], and founded as Muellerstadt (Miller Town) in 1752 by founder Jacob Muller (or \"Mueller\"). The town's charter was sponsored by George Washington in Virginia's House of Burgesses. Woodstock has been the County Seat of Shenandoah County, since Shenandoah County's formation in 1772.\n\n=== Colonial Era ===\n\nThe Shenandoah Valley region around Woodstock was settled by Pennsylvania Germans who migrated south down the natural route of the Shenandoah Valley in the mid 1700s. The majority of these German settlers tended small farms that grew crops other than tobacco, were not slaveholders and had Protestant faiths different from the established Anglican church in Virginia. They thus had different culture and beliefs than the English society that was prevalent on the eastern side of the mountains.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.virginiaplaces.org/settleland/landshen.html|title=Encouraging Settlement and Land Grants West of the Blue Ridge|website=www.virginiaplaces.org|accessdate=Jan 8, 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"auto15\">{{cite web|url=https://worldhistory.us/american-history/colonial-america-shenandoah-settlers.php|title=Colonial America \u2013 Shenandoah Settlers|first=Gail|last=Bellenger|date=October 10, 2018}}</ref>\n\n[[Senedo people|The Senedo Indians]] had also once lived in the Shenandoah Valley around Woodstock, but they disappeared as a tribe prior to European settlement, possibly from attack by the Catawba to the south.<ref name=\"auto11\">{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fA8ikAowjxAC&pg=PA60#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=A History of Shenandoah County, Virginia|first=John Walter|last=Wayland|date=October 30, 1980|publisher=Genealogical Publishing Com|via=Google Books}}</ref> By the time the German settlers arrived, few Native Americans lived in the Shenandoah Valley.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://accessgenealogy.com/virginia/exploration-and-settlement-of-the-shenandoah-valley.htm|title=Exploration and Settlement of the Shenandoah Valley|accessdate=Jan 8, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nps.gov/cebe/learn/historyculture/natives-americans-in-the-shenandoah-valley.htm|title=Natives Americans in the Shenandoah Valley - Cedar Creek & Belle Grove National Historical Park (U.S. National Park Service)|first1=Mailing Address: P.

In the 1760s, there was constant danger of Indian raids, with some atrocities and brutality.<ref name=\"auto5\"/> The last Indian raid in the area occurred in 1766, three years after the formal end of the French and Indian War, about two miles south of Woodstock.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nps.gov/cebe/learn/historyculture/cedar-creek-and-the-french-and-indian-war.htm|title=Cedar Creek and the French and Indian War - Cedar Creek & Belle Grove National Historical Park (U.S. National Park Service)|first1=Mailing Address: P.

With many improvements, Route 11 has largely followed this route, which was later called the Great Wagon Road and then the Valley Pike. Jacob Muller apparently used this old trail in laying out the plans for the main street of what would become Woodstock.<ref name=\"auto5\"/> Muellerstadt was the early name for Woodstock.<ref name=\"auto4\">{{cite web|url=http://www.shenandoahcountyhistoricalsociety.org/view.php?history|title=Shenandoah County Historical Society|website=www.shenandoahcountyhistoricalsociety.org}}</ref>\n\n=== Establishment of the town ===\n\nThe new village was established by an act in 1761, sponsored by George Washington. The town was renamed Woodstock at that time. George Washington was a member of the Virginia House of Burgesses, representing Frederick County (the Woodstock area was then part of Frederick County and would remain so until 1772.) The act of the General Assembly gave full credit to Jacob Muller for initiating the idea.<ref name=\"auto5\"/> Muller came from Germany in 1749 and had temporarily settled in Pennsylvania. By 1752 he obtained 400 acres from Lord Fairfax for the area that would eventually be included in the town limits of Woodstock. Muller settled in Narrow Passage near Woodstock, and in the next few years his holdings grew to something between 1200 and 2000 acres,<ref name=\"auto13\">{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=micSAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA244&lpg=PA244&dq=woodstock,+virginia+germans&source=bl&ots=mn8tBZc4yw&sig=ACfU3U00AtqFcQt0-lgCZJ3c9H_9xPPZOQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwit6YrD-cHlAhVK1lkKHUsZAfwQ6AEwDnoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&q=woodstock,+virginia+germans&f=false|title=The German Element of the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia|first=John Walter|last=Wayland|date=October 30, 1907|publisher=The author|via=Google Books}}</ref> and he proceeded to lay out a plan for the town, Mullerstadt.<ref name=\"auto5\"/> A few white settlers had preceded Muller, as the 1761 act establishing the town noted \"several persons are now living there\". It is realistic to assume this meant a scattering of log buildings.<ref name=\"auto5\"/>  However, Muller's town plan was that referred to in the 1761 General Assembly act that established Woodstock.<ref name=\"auto5\"/>\n\nThere is no clear reason why the town's name was changed to Woodstock, though theories include it being renamed by Washington<ref name=\"auto5\"/> or perhaps for a wood stockade used by the community as shelter from Indian raids. Notwithstanding, Jacob Muller's town continued for many years to be known as Millerstown, or to German-language residents, Muellerstadt.<ref name=\"auto5\"/> During the years following the establishment of the town, Muller held a big land sale in which 40 parcels he plotted were purchased.  Muller died in 1766, just four years after his land sales. Andrew Brewbaker, his son-in-law, became proprietor of his grant, supported by a board of trustees appointed by the General Assembly to govern the new town.<ref name=\"auto5\"/>  This form of government continued until 1795, when the town was authorized to hold elections. Unfortunately, the Town Trustees appointed in 1761 left no records, so early history of Woodstock as a town cannot be determined with accuracy. There was also no local newspaper until 1817.<ref name=\"auto5\"/>\n\n===  Revolutionary Era ===\n\nIn 1772, Woodstock became the county seat of Dunmore County (renamed Shenandoah County in 1777 during the Revolutionary War, shedding the name of the controversial last Royal governor of Virginia). Being named the county seat had significant impact for the development of the town. As a county seat, Woodstock necessitated the building of a courthouse and jail. By 1774, the county had erected a permanent courthouse.<ref name=\"auto5\"/>  That original court house was replaced in 1795 with a limestone building designed by Thomas Jefferson, using native limestone. It was enlarged in 1871 and 1886. The Shenandoah County Courthouse, located on Main Street, is the oldest courthouse still in use west of the Blue Ridge Mountains.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hmdb.org/marker.asp?marker=73774|title=Shenandoah County Courthouse Historical Marker|website=www.hmdb.org}}</ref>\n\n[[Peter Muhlenberg|John Peter Gabriel Muhlenberg]], a native of Pennsylvania who was formerly a soldier in the British Army and German dragoons, accepted a call to become pastor to a Woodstock congregation in 1771. After theological training, he served both Lutherans and Episcopalians for four years in a wide-ranging pastorate in the Shenandoah Valley. During this time he was drawn to in politics, serving in the House of Burgesses in 1774 and as a delegate to the [[First Virginia Convention]]. Muhlenberg became famous for his impassioned speeches for the revolutionary cause, helping to raise a regiment in the Shenandoah Valley among its German and Scots-Irish frontier population. He would lead this regiment, the 8th Virginia, as its Colonel in the Continental Army.<ref name=\"Architect of the Capitol\">{{cite web |title=John Peter Gabriel Muhlenberg |url=https://www.aoc.gov/art/national-statuary-hall-collection/john-peter-gabriel-muhlenberg |website=Architect of the Capitol |accessdate=31 October 2019 |language=en}} {{PD-notice}}</ref> At the conclusion of his fiery farewell sermon in Woodstock on January 21, 1776, Muhlenberg famously threw off his clerical robes to reveal an officer's uniform beneath and proclaimed, (according to later reports), \u201cin the language of Holy Writ there is a time for all things, a time to preach and a time to pray, but those times have passed away. There is a time to fight, and that time has now come.\u201d<ref name=\"auto4\"/> Muhlenberg went on to be promoted to a general in the Continental Army and led units in many battles, from Brandywine to Yorktown. Upon the end of the war in 1783, he did not return to live in Woodstock, but instead returned to his native Pennsylvania as a war hero, served in elected capacities and then was elected to the First Congress (1788-1789) and several successive Congresses. Elected to the Senate in 1801, he resigned to return to a revenue post in Philadelphia, where he died on October 1, 1807. While his statue in Congress' National Statuary Hall Collection was submitted by Pennsylvania in 1889, Muhlenberg has been revered in Woodstock for his fiery sermon and the unit he raised and inspired to fight for the nation's independence.<ref name=\"Architect of the Capitol\"/>\n\nThe frontier-recruited [[8th Virginia Regiment]] was drawn from Augusta, Berkeley, Culpeper, Dunmore (Shenandoah), Fincastle, Frederick Counties in the Shenandoah Valley, the district of West Augusta and Hampshire County which are in present-day West Virginia, and elsewhere along the Virginia frontier, which stretched from Kentucky to Fort Pitt (now Pittsburgh, PA.) Two of the ten companies were raised from the Dunmore County area of Woodstock.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.8thvirginia.com/1/category/frontier|title=Category: Frontier|website=The 8th Virginia Regiment|accessdate=Jan 8, 2020}}</ref> It was led by Muhlenberg, Colonel of the regiment and Abraham Bowman, Lt.

Frequently separated and detached to other units, the men of this tough, frontier-bred regiment served with distinction in many theatres of the war: White Plains, Trenton, Princeton, Short Hills, Cooch's Bridge, Brandywine, Saratoga, Germantown and Charleston. They suffered the hardships at Valley Forge, and were afterwards mustered out of service, with those who reenlisted merging into other Virginia units.<ref name=\"8thvirginia.com\"/>\n\n=== Railroads ===\n\nThe commercial importance of Woodstock was enhanced by the coming of the railroad, and the railroad has significant impact upon the Woodstock's development. The first railroad south of Strasburg was the Manassas Gap Railroad.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.virginiaplaces.org/rail/valleyrail.html|title=Railroads of the Shenandoah Valley - and Why Isn't Harrisonburg on the Main Line?|website=www.virginiaplaces.org}}</ref> On 2 March 1859 the line was extended to Mount Jackson. The Civil War interrupted the work however, and the line remained a long spur from Strasburg, with Mt Jackson as the terminus. In 1865 the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad (B&O) acquired and reconstructed the line after extensive damage during the Civil War, merging it with the Orange & Alexandria to form the Orange, Alexandria and Manassas Railroad.<ref name=\"auto16\">{{cite web|url=http://www.trainweb.org/PiedmontRR/railhst1.html|title=Norfolk Southern Railway History|website=www.trainweb.org}}</ref> They then extended the line to Harrisonburg in 1868.<ref name=\"auto5\"/> In 1872, the B&O formed a separate subsidiary railroad on the line known as the Strasburg & Harrisonburg RR (S&H RR). In 1873 the B&O RR leased and operated the S&H RR between Strasburg and Harrisonburg.  But the B&O encountered financial difficulties and sold the S&H railroad subsidiary to the Southern Railway in 1896.<!-- Deleted image removed:   [[File:Former Woodstock, VA Rail Depot.jpeg|thumb|left|Former B&O passenger depot at Woodstock VA, demolished in 1954]] -->\n\nIn 1888 the B&O built a passenger station in Woodstock, made with native limestone, noted as one of the more elaborate passenger depots in the region.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://shenandoahstories.org/items/show/46|title=Woodstock Depot|website=Shenandoah Stories|accessdate=Jan 8, 2020}}</ref> Woodstock became a freight rail entrepot with outward bound shipments of grain, cattle and fruit and inward bound freight of manufactured goods, rail service that continued into the 1960s. Passenger service ended in 1948 and freight rail service began to decline in the 1950s, reflecting a nationwide shift to cars and trucks with the advent of the national highway system. While individual industries were still served, sometime before 1969 regular freight depot service ended and the Woodstock freight depot was demolished in the 1970s.<ref name=\"auto14\">{{cite web|url=http://shenandoahstories.org/items/show/47|title=Woodstock Freight Depot|website=Shenandoah Stories}}</ref> The Southern Railway merged with the Norfolk & Western in 1982 to become the Norfolk Southern Railroad, which owns the line through Woodstock to this day. However, industrial need for the line ended, and the rail between Strasburg between Edinburg (through Woodstock) is out of service, though the track remains.<ref name=\"auto16\"/>\n\nIn 1954 the B&O sold the passenger station and it was torn down in 1954 by a local businessman despite protests of many locals, and its loss damaged Woodstock's historical character and heritage as a once-active railroad town.<ref name=\"auto7\">{{cite web|url=http://shenandoahstories.org/items/show/46|title=Woodstock Depot|website=Shenandoah Stories}}</ref>\n\n=== Civil War Era ===\nConfederate military units raised in Woodstock included Company F (the Muhlenberg Rifles) of the [[10th Virginia Infantry]] (of whom 71% had German surnames)<ref name=\"auto13\"/> as well as Company C of the [[33rd Virginia Infantry]], part of the Stonewall Brigade led by [[Stonewall Jackson|Thomas \"Stonewall\" Jackson]]. While the area had an active Confederate population, it also was home to many reluctant secessionists, Unionists and families religiously opposed to slavery and war ([[Mennonites]], [[Schwarzenau Brethren|German Dunkards]].) In addition, traditional enmity between the slavery-based plantation society in eastern Virginia and the small farm populations over the rugged Blue Ridge and Allegheny mountains, where slavery was not as predominant an economic institution, meant that allegiances in the Shenandoah Valley and western Virginia were often divided. Many of German descent in the Shenandoah Valley were generally or religiously opposed to slavery, even as others with German ethnicity served in the Confederate Army.<ref name=\"auto13\"/>\n\nThe Civil War left no serious visible scars on the town,<ref name=\"auto5\"/> although there was [[Partisan (military)|partisan activity]] and retaliation.<ref name=\"auto17\">{{cite web|url=https://www.hmdb.org/marker.asp?marker=5277|title=Woodstock Historical Marker|website=www.hmdb.org}}</ref> A few buildings were destroyed, notably the railroad depot and some warehouses along with a locomotive and some rolling stock.<ref name=\"auto17\"/> No major battles were fought in the immediate vicinity of the town, although skirmishes and large troop movements were not uncommon.

In conjunction with spring 1864 offensives, Union Lt. Gen. [[Ulysses S. Grant]] ordered Maj. Gen. [[Franz Sigel]] to move down the Valley Pike from West Virginia to [[Lynchburg, Virginia|Lynchburg]], to destroy its railroads and canal while denying the rich Shenandoah Valley to the Confederacy. Receiving intelligence on these movements, Confederate Maj. Gen. [[John C. Breckinridge]] scraped together all available troops, including cadets from Virginia Military Institute (VMI) in Lexington. Sigel's advance was slowed by Confederate cavalry and undermined by his own command jealousies and inept decisions, but on May 11 his cavalry captured a lightly defended Woodstock. The Confederates were forced out of Woodstock so fast that several telegrams between Breckinridge and his cavalry commander [[John D. Imboden]] fell into Union hands. These Woodstock dispatches revealed strength and location of Confederate forces as well as a rough time table for a cavalry rendezvous with the main Confederate force - potentially a game-changing intelligence coup. But rather than acting decisively, Sigel continued his cautious advance, allowing Confederates time to concentrate.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.essentialcivilwarcurriculum.com/the-battle-of-new-market.html|title=StackPath|website=www.essentialcivilwarcurriculum.com|accessdate=Jan 8, 2020}}</ref> Breckenridge decided to attack Sigel's army, which had advanced from Woodstock. The Battle of New Market occurred on morning of May 15. Threatened by cavalry on his flank and rear, Sigel withdrew and retreated through Woodstock all the way to Strasburg.

Woodstock is also home to the [[Woodstock River Bandits|River Bandits]] of the [[Valley Baseball League]], the Shenandoah County Public School's Central campus, and the Shenandoah County Fairgrounds.\n\n==History==\nThe town was established by charter in March 1761 as a part of what was then Frederick County. It was originally formed from a land grant from [[Lord Fairfax]], and founded as Muellerstadt (Miller Town) in 1752 by founder Jacob Muller (or \"Mueller\"). The town's charter was sponsored by George Washington in Virginia's House of Burgesses. Woodstock has been the County Seat of Shenandoah County, since Shenandoah County's formation in 1772.\n\n=== Colonial Era ===\n\nThe Shenandoah Valley region around Woodstock was settled by Pennsylvania Germans who migrated south down the natural route of the Shenandoah Valley in the mid 1700s. The majority of these German settlers tended small farms that grew crops other than tobacco, were not slaveholders and had Protestant faiths different from the established Anglican church in Virgina. They thus had different culture and beliefs than the English society that was prevalent on the eastern side of the mountains.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.virginiaplaces.org/settleland/landshen.html|title=Encouraging Settlement and Land Grants West of the Blue Ridge|website=www.virginiaplaces.org|accessdate=Jan 8, 2020}}</ref><ref name=\"auto15\">{{cite web|url=https://worldhistory.us/american-history/colonial-america-shenandoah-settlers.php|title=Colonial America \u2013 Shenandoah Settlers|first=Gail|last=Bellenger|date=October 10, 2018}}</ref>\n\n[[Senedo people|The Senedo Indians]] had also once lived in the Shenandoah Valley around Woodstock, but they disappeared as a tribe prior to European settlement, possibly from attack by the Catawba to the south.<ref name=\"auto11\">{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fA8ikAowjxAC&pg=PA60#v=onepage&q&f=false|title=A History of Shenandoah County, Virginia|first=John Walter|last=Wayland|date=October 30, 1980|publisher=Genealogical Publishing Com|via=Google Books}}</ref> By the time the German settlers arrived, few Native Americans lived in the Shenandoah Valley.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://accessgenealogy.com/virginia/exploration-and-settlement-of-the-shenandoah-valley.htm|title=Exploration and Settlement of the Shenandoah Valley|accessdate=Jan 8, 2020}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nps.gov/cebe/learn/historyculture/natives-americans-in-the-shenandoah-valley.htm|title=Natives Americans in the Shenandoah Valley - Cedar Creek & Belle Grove National Historical Park (U.S. National Park Service)|first1=Mailing Address: P.

With many improvements, Route 11 has largely followed this route, which was later called the Great Wagon Road and then the Valley Pike. Jacob Muller apparently used this old trail in laying out the plans for the main street of what would become Woodstock.<ref name=\"auto5\"/> Muellerstadt was the early name for Woodstock.<ref name=\"auto4\">{{cite web|url=http://www.shenandoahcountyhistoricalsociety.org/view.php?history|title=Shenandoah County Historical Society|website=www.shenandoahcountyhistoricalsociety.org}}</ref>\n\n=== Establishment of the town ===\n\nThe new village was established by an act in 1761, sponsored by George Washington. The town was renamed Woodstock at that time. George Washington was a member of the Virginia House of Burgesses, representing Frederick County (the Woodstock area was then part of Frederick County and would remain so until 1772.) The act of the General Assembly gave full credit to Jacob Muller for initiating the idea.<ref name=\"auto5\"/> Muller came from Germany in 1749 and had temporarily settled in Pennsylvania. By 1752 he obtained 400 acres from Lord Fairfax for the area that would eventually be included in the town limits of Woodstock. Muller settled in Narrow Passage near Woodstock, and in the next few years his holdings grew to something between 1200 and 2000 acres,<ref name=\"auto13\">{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=micSAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA244&lpg=PA244&dq=woodstock,+virginia+germans&source=bl&ots=mn8tBZc4yw&sig=ACfU3U00AtqFcQt0-lgCZJ3c9H_9xPPZOQ&hl=en&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwit6YrD-cHlAhVK1lkKHUsZAfwQ6AEwDnoECAkQAQ#v=onepage&q=woodstock,+virginia+germans&f=false|title=The German Element of the Shenandoah Valley of Virginia|first=John Walter|last=Wayland|date=October 30, 1907|publisher=The author|via=Google Books}}</ref> and he proceeded to lay out a plan for the town, Mullerstadt.<ref name=\"auto5\"/> A few white settlers had preceded Muller, as the 1761 act establishing the town noted \"several persons are now living there\". It is realistic to assume this meant a scattering of log buildings.<ref name=\"auto5\"/>  However, Muller's town plan was that referred to in the 1761 General Assembly act that established Woodstock.<ref name=\"auto5\"/>\n\nThere is no clear reason why the town's name was changed to Woodstock, though theories include it being renamed by Washington<ref name=\"auto5\"/> or perhaps for a wood stockade used by the community as shelter from Indian raids. Notwithstanding, Jacob Muller's town continued for many years to be known as Millerstown, or to German-language residents, Muellerstadt.<ref name=\"auto5\"/> During the years following the establishment of the town, Muller held a big land sale in which 40 parcels he plotted were purchased.  Muller died in 1766, just four years after his land sales. Andrew Brewbaker, his son-in-law, became proprietor of his grant, supported by a board of trustees appointed by the General Assembly to govern the new town.<ref name=\"auto5\"/>  This form of government continued until 1795, when the town was authorized to hold elections. Unfortunately, the Town Trustees appointed in 1761 left no records, so early history of Woodstock as a town cannot be determined with accuracy. There was also no local newspaper until 1817.<ref name=\"auto5\"/>\n\n===  Revolutionary Era ===\n\nIn 1772, Woodstock became the county seat of Dunmore County (renamed Shenandoah County in 1777 during the Revolutionary War, shedding the name of the controversial last Royal governor of Virginia). Being named the county seat had significant impact for the development of the town. As a county seat, Woodstock necessitated the building of a courthouse and jail. By 1774, the county had erected a permanent courthouse.<ref name=\"auto5\"/>  That original court house was replaced in 1795 with a limestone building designed by Thomas Jefferson, using native limestone. It was enlarged in 1871 and 1886. The Shenandoah County Courthouse, located on Main Street, is the oldest courthouse still in use west of the Blue Ridge Mountains.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hmdb.org/marker.asp?marker=73774|title=Shenandoah County Courthouse Historical Marker|website=www.hmdb.org}}</ref>\n\n[[Peter Muhlenberg|John Peter Gabriel Muhlenberg]], a native of Pennyslvania who was formerly a soldier in the British Army and German dragoons, accepted a call to become pastor to a Woodstock congregation in 1771. After theological training, he served both Lutherans and Episcopalians for four years in a wide-ranging pastorate in the Shenandoah Valley. During this time he was drawn to in politics, serving in the House of Burgesses in 1774 and as a delegate to the [[First Virginia Convention]]. Muhlenberg became famous for his impassioned speeches for the revolutionary cause, helping to raise a regiment in the Shenandoah Valley among its German and Scots-Irish frontier population. He would lead this regiment, the 8th Virginia, as its Colonel in the Continental Army.<ref name=\"Architect of the Capitol\">{{cite web |title=John Peter Gabriel Muhlenberg |url=https://www.aoc.gov/art/national-statuary-hall-collection/john-peter-gabriel-muhlenberg |website=Architect of the Capitol |accessdate=31 October 2019 |language=en}} {{PD-notice}}</ref> At the conclusion of his fiery farewell sermon in Woodstock on January 21, 1776, Muhlenberg famously threw off his clerical robes to reveal an officer's uniform beneath and proclaimed, (according to later reports), \u201cin the language of Holy Writ there is a time for all things, a time to preach and a time to pray, but those times have passed away. There is a time to fight, and that time has now come.\u201d<ref name=\"auto4\"/> Muhlenberg went on to be promoted to a general in the Continental Army and led units in many battles, from Brandywine to Yorktown. Upon the end of the war in 1783, he did not return to live in Woodstock, but instead returned to his native Pennsylvania as a war hero, served in elected capacities and then was elected to the First Congress (1788-1789) and several successive Congresses. Elected to the Senate in 1801, he resigned to return to a revenue post in Philadelphia, where he died on October 1, 1807. While his statue in Congress' National Statuary Hall Collection was submitted by Pennsylvania in 1889, Muhlenberg has been revered in Woodstock for his fiery sermon and the unit he raised and inspired to fight for the nation's independence.<ref name=\"Architect of the Capitol\"/>\n\nThe frontier-recruited [[8th Virginia Regiment]] was drawn from Augusta, Berkeley, Culpeper, Dunmore (Shenandoah), Fincastle, Frederick Counties in the Shenandoah Valley, the district of West Augusta and Hampshire County which are in present-day West Virginia, and elsewhere along the Virginia frontier, which stretched from Kentucky to Fort Pitt (now Pittsburgh, PA.) Two of the ten companies were raised from the Dunmore County area of Woodstock.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.8thvirginia.com/1/category/frontier|title=Category: Frontier|website=The 8th Virginia Regiment|accessdate=Jan 8, 2020}}</ref> It was led by Muhlenberg, Colonel of the regiment and Abraham Bowman, Lt.

Frequently separated and detached to other units, the men of this tough, frontier-bred regiment served with distinction in many theatres of the war: White Plains, Trenton, Princeton, Short Hills, Cooch's Bridge, Brandywine, Saratoga, Germantown and Charleston. They suffered the hardships at Valley Forge, and were afterwards mustered out of service, with those who reenlisted merging into other Virginia units.<ref name=\"8thvirginia.com\"/>\n\n=== Railroads ===\n\nThe commercial importance of Woodstock was enhanced by the coming of the railroad, and the railroad has significant impact upon the Woodstock's development. The first railroad south of Strasburg was the Manassas Gap Railroad.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.virginiaplaces.org/rail/valleyrail.html|title=Railroads of the Shenandoah Valley - and Why Isn't Harrisonburg on the Main Line?|website=www.virginiaplaces.org}}</ref> On 2 March 1859 the line was extended to Mount Jackson. The Civil War interrupted the work however, and the line remained a long spur from Strasburg, with Mt Jackson as the terminus. In 1865 the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad (B&O) acquired and reconstructed the line after extensive damage during the Civil War, merging it with the Orange & Alexandria to form the Orange, Alexandria and Manassas Railroad.<ref name=\"auto16\">{{cite web|url=http://www.trainweb.org/PiedmontRR/railhst1.html|title=Norfolk Southern Railway History|website=www.trainweb.org}}</ref> They then extended the line to Harrisonburg in 1868.<ref name=\"auto5\"/> In 1872, the B&O formed a separate subsidiary railroad on the line known as the Strasburg & Harrisonburg RR (S&H RR). In 1873 the B&O RR leased and operated the S&H RR between Strasburg and Harrisonburg.  But the B&O encountered financial difficulties and sold the S&H railroad subsidiary to the Southern Railway in 1896.<!-- Deleted image removed:   [[File:Former Woodstock, VA Rail Depot.jpeg|thumb|left|Former B&O passenger depot at Woodstock VA, demolished in 1954]] -->\n\nIn 1888 the B&O built a passenger station in Woodstock, made with native limestone, noted as one of the more elaborate passenger depots in the region.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://shenandoahstories.org/items/show/46|title=Woodstock Depot|website=Shenandoah Stories|accessdate=Jan 8, 2020}}</ref> Woodstock became a freight rail entrepot with outward bound shipments of grain, cattle and fruit and inward bound freight of manufactured goods, rail service that continued into the 1960s. Passenger service ended in 1948 and freight rail service began to decline in the 1950s, reflecting a nationwide shift to cars and trucks with the advent of the national highway system. While individual industries were still served, sometime before 1969 regular freight depot service ended and the Woodstock freight depot was demolished in the 1970s.<ref name=\"auto14\">{{cite web|url=http://shenandoahstories.org/items/show/47|title=Woodstock Freight Depot|website=Shenandoah Stories}}</ref> The Southern Railway merged with the Norfolk & Western in 1982 to become the Norfolk Southern Railroad, which owns the line through Woodstock to this day.

While the area had an active Confederate population, it also was home to many reluctant secessionists, Unionists and families religiously opposed to slavery and war ([[Mennonites]], [[Schwarzenau Brethren|German Dunkards]].) In addition, traditional enmity between the slavery-based plantation society in eastern Virginia and the small farm populations over the rugged Blue Ridge and Allegheny mountains, where slavery was not as predominant an economic institution, meant that allegiances in the Shenandoah Valley and western Virginia were often divided.

In conjunction with spring 1864 offensives, Union Lt. Gen. [[Ulysses S. Grant]] ordered Maj. Gen. [[Franz Sigel]] to move down the Valley Pike from West Virginia to [[Lynchburg, Virginia|Lynchburg]], to destroy its railroads and canal while denying the rich Shenandoah Valley to the Confederacy. Receiving intelligence on these movements, Confederate Maj. Gen. [[John C. Breckinridge]] scraped together all available troops, including cadets from Virginia Military Institute (VMI) in Lexington. Sigel's advance was slowed by Confederate cavalry and undermined by his own command jealousies and inept decisions, but on May 11 his cavalry captured a lightly defended Woodstock. The Confederates were forced out of Woodstock so fast that several telegrams between Breckinridge and his cavalry commander [[John D. Imboden]] fell into Union hands. These Woodstock dispatches revealed strength and location of Confederate forces as well as a rough time table for a cavalry rendezvous with the main Confederate force - potentially a game-changing intelligence coup. But rather than acting decisively, Sigel continued his cautious advance, allowing Confederates time to concentrate.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.essentialcivilwarcurriculum.com/the-battle-of-new-market.html|title=StackPath|website=www.essentialcivilwarcurriculum.com|accessdate=Jan 8, 2020}}</ref> Breckenridge decided to attack Sigel's army, which had advanced from Woodstock.
