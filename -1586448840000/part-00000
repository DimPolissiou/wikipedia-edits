He defaces an important Chinese memorial as a result of being drugged by a Chinese general and is later kicked out of the Army.

The 37th [[List of Walt Disney Animation Studios films|Disney animated feature film]], the tenth and last released during the [[Disney Renaissance]] era, it is based on the story ''[[Tarzan of the Apes]]'' by [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]], being the first animated major motion picture version of the story. Directed by [[Chris Buck]] and [[Kevin Lima]] from a screenplay by Tab Murphy, [[Bob Tzudiker]], and [[Noni White]], the film stars the voices of [[Tony Goldwyn]], [[Minnie Driver]], [[Glenn Close]], [[Rosie O'Donnell]], [[Brian Blessed]], [[Lance Henriksen]], [[Wayne Knight]], and [[Nigel Hawthorne]].\n\nPre-production of ''Tarzan'' began in 1995, with Lima selected as director<ref>{{cite web|last=Fulton|first=Rick|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/BACK+TO+BASICS%3A+DISNEY+FINALLY+MAKE+THE+APE+MAN+THE+KIND.-a060358245|title=Back to Basics: Disney Finally Makes the Ape Man the Kind|work=[[Daily Record (Scotland)|The Daily Record]]|publisher=TheFreeLibrary.com|date=September 17, 1999|accessdate=November 8, 2015}}</ref> and Buck joining him the same year. Following Murphy's first draft, Tzudiker, White, and Dave Reynolds were brought in to reconstruct the third act and add additional material to the screenplay. English recording artist [[Phil Collins]] was recruited to compose and record songs integrated with a score by [[Mark Mancina]]. Meanwhile, the production team embarked on a research trip to [[Uganda]] and [[Kenya]] to study the gorillas. The animation of the film combines [[traditional animation|2D traditional hand-drawn animation]] with the extensive use of [[computer-generated imagery]], and it was done in California, [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]], and Paris, with the pioneering [[computer animation]] software system Deep Canvas being predominantly used to create three-dimensional backgrounds.\n\n''Tarzan'' premiered at the [[El Capitan Theatre]] on June 12, 1999, and was released in the United States on June 16, 1999. It received a positive reaction from critics, who praised its animation and music. Against a production budget of $130 million (then the most expensive animated film ever made until  ''[[Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within]]'' in 2001), the film grossed $448.2 million worldwide, becoming the fifth-highest film release in 1999, the second-highest animation release of 1999 behind ''[[Toy Story 2]]'', and the first Disney animated feature to open at first place at the North American box office since ''[[Pocahontas (1995 film)|Pocahontas]]'' (1995). It won the [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]] (\"You'll Be in My Heart\" by Phil Collins). The film has led to many derived works, such as a [[Tarzan (musical)|Broadway adaptation]], a [[The Legend of Tarzan (TV series)|television series]], and two [[direct-to-video]] sequels: ''[[Tarzan & Jane]]'' (2002) and ''[[Tarzan II]]'' (2005).\n\n==Plot==\nIn the late 19th century, an English couple and their infant son survive a shipwreck. They end up near an uncharted rainforest on the Congolese coast, where they build themselves a treehouse from the ship's wreckage. Meanwhile, [[Kerchak]], the leader of a troop of gorillas, and his mate [[Kala (Tarzan)|Kala]] mourn the death of their baby at the hands of a savage leopard named [[Sabor (Tarzan)|Sabor]]. Soon afterward, Kala hears the infant son's cries and finds the treehouse, where she discovers that Sabor has killed the couple as well. Kala encounters Sabor and escapes with the infant in her possession. Kala takes the infant back to her troop to raise as her own, an action which Kerchak objects to. Kala adopts the human child, naming him Tarzan. When aged seven, Tarzan begins to befriend other animals, including Kala and Kerchak's niece [[Terk (Tarzan)|Terk]] and a paranoid elephant named Tantor; but he is treated hostilely by Kerchak due to physical differences, so he makes great efforts to improve himself. As an adult, Tarzan manages to slay Sabor with a spear he crafted, gaining Kerchak's respect.\n\nOne day, the gorillas' peaceful life is interrupted by the arrival of a team of English explorers, consisting of Professor Archimedes Q. Porter, his daughter [[Jane Porter (Tarzan)|Jane]], and their tour guide, a hunter named Clayton, who have come looking for gorillas to study. Jane drifts out of the group, and is attacked by a baboon troop, who chase her through the trees' branches, but a curious Tarzan manages to save her. Tarzan realizes that Jane is similar to him, and she leads him to their camp, where Porter and Clayton garner interest in him. Porter views Tarzan as an opportunity for scientific advancement, while Clayton desires to persuade Tarzan to lead him to the gorillas. Kerchak firmly warns Tarzan to stay away from them, but Tarzan disobeys his warnings and continues to return to the camp, where the Porters and Clayton teach him what the human civilization is like with the use of a slide projector and various other gadgets. A few months pass, and Jane and Tarzan begin to develop feelings for each other, but Tarzan still refuses to lead them to the gorillas out of respect for Kerchak.\n\nThe explorers' ship soon returns to retrieve them. Jane asks Tarzan to return with them to England, but Tarzan asks Jane to stay with him when Jane says that it is unlikely that they will ever return. Clayton convinces Tarzan that Jane will stay with him if he leads them to the gorillas. Tarzan agrees and leads the trio to the nesting grounds, while Terk and Tantor lure Kerchak away to prevent him from attacking the humans. Jane and her father are excited to mingle with the gorillas, when suddenly, Kerchak returns and attacks the Porters and Clayton, but Tarzan stops him with a chokehold, allowing them to escape. Kerchak accuses Tarzan of betraying the troop, who turns against him. Kala takes Tarzan to the treehouse where she found him and reveals his past to him. He dons a suit that once belonged to his father, signifying his decision to go to England, before he and Kala share a bittersweet goodbye.\n\nWhen Tarzan boards the ship with Jane and Porter, they are all captured by Clayton and his band of stowaway poachers. Clayton reveals his plan to capture the gorillas and sell them for a fortune, and he was just using the Porters for a way to go to the jungle. He subsequently used Tarzan to find the nesting grounds and locks him, Jane, and Porter away in the storage area of the ship. Tarzan manages to escape with the help of Terk and Tantor and returns to the jungle to save the gorillas. During the ensuing battle, Kerchak gives his life to protect Tarzan by charging between him and Clayton's shotgun. Tarzan fights Clayton across the treetops and eventually corners him. Instead of killing Clayton, Tarzan spares his life, and destroys his gun, but Clayton attempts to kill him with a machete. Tarzan hits a nearby tree, causing vines to fall on Clayton, entangling him. In an attempt to free himself, Clayton violently slashes the vines around him with the machete except for one around his throat, causing him to fall out of the trees, hanging him to death. Kerchak apologizes to Tarzan, finally accepts him as his son, and names him his successor before peacefully dying.\n\nThe next day, Jane and her father prepare to leave on the ship, but Tarzan remains behind with the gorilla troop, intending to withhold Kerchak's last wish to lead and protect the family in his place. As the ship departs, Porter encourages his daughter to stay with Tarzan, and Jane jumps overboard to meet Tarzan with her father shortly following her. The Porters reunite with Tarzan and embark on their new life together.\n\n==Voice cast==\n* [[Tony Goldwyn]] as [[Tarzan]], a twenty-year-old man raised by gorillas who finds his human roots. [[Glen Keane]] served as the supervising animator for Tarzan as an adult, while John Ripa animated Tarzan as an infant and child.

Linz]] as young Tarzan\n* [[Minnie Driver]] as [[Jane Porter (Tarzan)|Jane Porter]], the eccentric, feisty, kind-hearted, and intelligent daughter of Professor Porter. She is the first of the group to encounter Tarzan and becomes his love interest. Ken Duncan served as the supervising animator for Jane. Many of Driver's mannerisms and characteristics were incorporated into Jane's animation. The scene where Jane describes meeting Tarzan for the first time to her father and Clayton was improvised by Driver, resulting in Ken Duncan animating one of the longest animated scenes on record. The scene took 7 weeks to animate and 73 feet of film.<ref name=\"Green\" />\n* [[Glenn Close]] as [[Kala (Tarzan)|Kala]], Tarzan's adoptive mother, who found and raised him after losing her biological son to Sabor.

Porter, an eccentric, short-statured scientist and Jane's father. Dave Burgess served as the supervising animator for Porter. This was Hawthorne's final voice acting role before his death in 2001.\n* [[Rosie O'Donnell]] as Terk (short for Terkina, a feminization of Terkoz merged with Teeka), Tarzan's best friend, a wisecracking gorilla. She is also Kala and Kerchak's niece, making her and Tarzan adoptive cousins.

For the third act, Murphy suggested that Tarzan should leave for England, as he did in the book, but the directors felt that it was incompatible with their central theme of what defines a family. In order to keep Tarzan in the jungle, the third act needed to be restructured by redefining the role of the villain and inventing a way to endanger the gorillas.<ref name=\"Green\" /> In this departure from Burrough's novel, a villain named Clayton was created to serve as a guide for Professor Archimedes Q.

The 6000-mile distance and difference in time zones posed challenges for collaboration, especially for scenes with Tarzan and Jane. [[Glen Keane]] was the supervising animator for Tarzan at the Paris studio, while Ken Duncan was the supervising animator for Jane at the studio in Burbank. To make coordinating scenes with multiple characters easier, the animators used a system called a \"scene machine\" that could send rough drawings between the two animation studios.<ref name=\"Green\" /> Meanwhile, following production on ''[[Mulan (1998 film)|Mulan]]'', two hundred animators at the [[Animation studios owned by The Walt Disney Company#Walt Disney Feature Animation Florida|Feature Animation Florida satellite studio]] provided character animation and special effects animation where the filmmakers had to discuss their work through daily video conferences among the three studios.<ref>{{cite news|last=Abbott|first=Jim|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1999-06-08/lifestyle/9906070397_1_animated-tarzan-keane-character|title=A Fresh Tarzan|newspaper=Orlando Sentinel|date=June 8, 1999|accessdate=September 11, 2015}}</ref>\n\nKeane was inspired to make Tarzan \"surf\" through the trees because of his son's interest in extreme sports, and he began working on a test scene. The directors expressed concern that Tarzan would be made into a \"surfer dude\", but when Keane revealed the test animation to them they liked it enough to use it in the film during the \"Son of Man\" sequence, with movements inspired by skateboarder [[Tony Hawk]]. Although Keane initially thought that Tarzan would be easy to animate because he only wears a loincloth, he realized that he would need a fully working human musculature while still being able to move like an animal. To figure out Tarzan's movements, the Paris animation team studied different animals in order to transpose their movements onto him. They also consulted with a professor of anatomy. This resulted in Tarzan being the first Disney character to accurately display working muscles.<ref name=\"Green\" />\n\nTo prepare for animating the gorillas, the animation team attended lectures on primates, made trips to zoos, and studied nature documentaries, with a group of animators also witnessing a gorilla dissection to learn about their musculature. In 1996, the animation team went on a two-week safari in Kenya to take reference photographs and observe the animals. On the trip, they visited [[Bwindi Impenetrable National Park]] in Uganda to view mountain gorillas in the wild, and get inspiration for the setting.<ref name=\"Green\" /> In 2000, Chris Buck repeated the journey accompanied by journalists to promote the film's home video release.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Falk|first1=Quentin|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/HOLIDAYS%3A+Close+encounter+of+the+hairy+kind.-a064964720|title=Holidays: Close encounter of the hairy kind|accessdate=August 30, 2014|work=Sunday Mirror|publisher=MGN Ltd.|date=September 3, 2000|page=53}} Available through [[ProQuest]] Historical Newsstand.</ref>\n\nTo create the sweeping 3D backgrounds, ''Tarzan''{{'}}s production team developed a 3D painting and rendering technique known as ''Deep Canvas'' (a term coined by artist/engineer Eric Daniels).<ref name=\"Essman\" /> This technique allows artists to produce [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] background that looks like a traditional painting, according to art director [[Daniel St. Pierre]].<ref name=\"Essman\" /> (The software keeps track of brushstrokes applied in 3D space.)<ref name=\"Essman\">{{cite web |url=http://www.moviemaker.com/directing/article/state_of_the_art_of_fx_3271/ |title=State of the Art of F/X |accessdate=April 6, 2009 |last=Essman |first=Scott |date=July 5, 1999 |publisher=MovieMaker Magazine |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090606210336/http://www.moviemaker.com/directing/article/state_of_the_art_of_fx_3271/ |archivedate=June 6, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> For this advancement, the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] awarded the creators of ''Deep Canvas'' a Technical Achievement Award in 2003.

The 37th [[List of Walt Disney Animation Studios films|Disney animated feature film]], the tenth and last released during the [[Disney Renaissance]] era, it is based on the story ''[[Tarzan of the Apes]]'' by [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]], being the first animated major motion picture version of the story. Directed by [[Chris Buck]] and [[Kevin Lima]] from a screenplay by Tab Murphy, [[Bob Tzudiker]], and [[Noni White]], the film stars the voices of [[Tony Goldwyn]], [[Minnie Driver]], [[Glenn Close]], [[Rosie O'Donnell]], [[Brian Blessed]], [[Lance Henriksen]], [[Wayne Knight]], and [[Nigel Hawthorne]].\n\nPre-production of ''Tarzan'' began in 1995, with Lima selected as director<ref>{{cite web|last=Fulton|first=Rick|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/BACK+TO+BASICS%3A+DISNEY+FINALLY+MAKE+THE+APE+MAN+THE+KIND.-a060358245|title=Back to Basics: Disney Finally Makes the Ape Man the Kind|work=[[Daily Record (Scotland)|The Daily Record]]|publisher=TheFreeLibrary.com|date=September 17, 1999|accessdate=November 8, 2015}}</ref> and Buck joining him the same year. Following Murphy's first draft, Tzudiker, White, and Dave Reynolds were brought in to reconstruct the third act and add additional material to the screenplay. English recording artist [[Phil Collins]] was recruited to compose and record songs integrated with a score by [[Mark Mancina]]. Meanwhile, the production team embarked on a research trip to [[Uganda]] and [[Kenya]] to study the gorillas. The animation of the film combines [[traditional animation|2D traditional hand-drawn animation]] with the extensive use of [[computer-generated imagery]], and it was done in California, [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]], and Paris, with the pioneering [[computer animation]] software system Deep Canvas being predominantly used to create three-dimensional backgrounds.\n\n''Tarzan'' premiered at the [[El Capitan Theatre]] on June 12, 1999, and was released in the United States on June 16, 1999. It received a positive reaction from critics, who praised its animation and music. Against a production budget of $130 million (then the most expensive animated film ever made until  ''[[Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within]]'' in 2001), the film grossed $448.2 million worldwide, becoming the fifth-highest film release in 1999, the second-highest animation release of 1999 behind ''[[Toy Story 2]]'', and the first Disney animated feature to open at first place at the North American box office since ''[[Pocahontas (1995 film)|Pocahontas]]'' (1995). It won the [[Academy Award for Best Original Song]] (\"You'll Be in My Heart\" by Phil Collins). The film has led to many derived works, such as a [[Tarzan (musical)|Broadway adaptation]], a [[The Legend of Tarzan (TV series)|television series]], and two [[direct-to-video]] sequels: ''[[Tarzan & Jane]]'' (2002) and ''[[Tarzan II]]'' (2005).\n\n==Plot==\nIn the late 19th century, an English couple and their infant son survive a shipwreck. They end up near an uncharted rainforest on the Congolese coast, where they build themselves a treehouse from the ship's wreckage. Meanwhile, [[Kerchak]], the leader of a troop of gorillas, and his mate [[Kala (Tarzan)|Kala]] mourn the death of their baby at the hands of a savage leopard named [[Sabor (Tarzan)|Sabor]]. Soon afterward, Kala hears the infant son's cries and finds the treehouse, where she discovers that Sabor has killed the couple as well. Kala encounters Sabor and escapes with the infant in her possession. Kala takes the infant back to her troop to raise as her own, an action which Kerchak objects to. Kala adopts the human child, naming him Tarzan. When aged seven, Tarzan begins to befriend other animals, including Kala and Kerchak's niece [[Terk (Tarzan)|Terk]] and a paranoid elephant named Tantor; but he is treated hostilely by Kerchak due to physical differences, so he makes great efforts to improve himself. As an adult, Tarzan manages to slay Sabor with a spear he crafted, gaining Kerchak's respect.\n\nOne day, the gorillas' peaceful life is interrupted by the arrival of a team of English explorers, consisting of Professor Archimedes Q. Porter, his daughter [[Jane Porter (Tarzan)|Jane]], and their tour guide, a hunter named Clayton, who have come looking for gorillas to study. Jane drifts out of the group, and is attacked by a baboon troop, who chase her through the trees' branches, but a curious Tarzan manages to save her. Tarzan realizes that Jane is similar to him, and she leads him to their camp, where Porter and Clayton garner interest in him. Porter views Tarzan as an opportunity for scientific advancement, while Clayton desires to persuade Tarzan to lead him to the gorillas. Kerchak firmly warns Tarzan to stay away from them, but Tarzan disobeys his warnings and continues to return to the camp, where the Porters and Clayton teach him what the human civilization is like with the use of a slide projector and various other gadgets. A few months pass, and Jane and Tarzan begin to develop feelings for each other, but Tarzan still refuses to lead them to the gorillas out of respect for Kerchak.\n\nThe explorers' ship soon returns to retrieve them. Jane asks Tarzan to return with them to England, but Tarzan asks Jane to stay with him when Jane says that it is unlikely that they will ever return. Clayton convinces Tarzan that Jane will stay with him if he leads them to the gorillas. Tarzan agrees and leads the trio to the nesting grounds, while Terk and Tantor lure Kerchak away to prevent him from attacking the humans. Jane and her father are excited to mingle with the gorillas, when suddenly, Kerchak returns and attacks the Porters and Clayton, but Tarzan stops him with a chokehold, allowing them to escape. Kerchak accuses Tarzan of betraying the troop, who turns against him. Kala takes Tarzan to the treehouse where she found him and reveals his past to him. He dons a suit that once belonged to his father, signifying his decision to go to England, before he and Kala share a bittersweet goodbye.\n\nWhen Tarzan boards the ship with Jane and Porter, they are all captured by Clayton and his band of stowaway poachers. Clayton reveals his plan to capture the gorillas and sell them for a fortune, and he was just using the Porters for a way to go to the jungle. He subsequently used Tarzan to find the nesting grounds and locks him, Jane, and Porter away in the storage area of the ship. Tarzan manages to escape with the help of Terk and Tantor and returns to the jungle to save the gorillas. During the ensuing battle, Kerchak gives his life to protect Tarzan by charging between him and Clayton's shotgun. Tarzan fights Clayton across the treetops and eventually corners him. Instead of killing Clayton, Tarzan spares his life, and destroys his gun, but Clayton attempts to kill him with a machete. Tarzan hits a nearby tree, causing vines to fall on Clayton, entangling him. In an attempt to free himself, Clayton violently slashes the vines around him with the machete except for one around his throat, causing him to fall out of the trees, hanging him to death. Kerchak apologizes to Tarzan, finally accepts him as his son, and names him his successor before peacefully dying.\n\nThe next day, Jane and her father prepare to leave on the ship, but Tarzan remains behind with the gorilla troop, intending to withhold Kerchak's last wish to lead and protect the family in his place. As the ship departs, Porter encourages his daughter to stay with Tarzan, and Jane jumps overboard to meet Tarzan with her father shortly following her. The Porters reunite with Tarzan and embark on their new life together.\n\n==Voice cast==\n* [[Tony Goldwyn]] as [[Tarzan]], a twenty-year-old man raised by gorillas who finds his human roots. [[Glen Keane]] served as the supervising animator for Tarzan as an adult, while John Ripa animated Tarzan as an infant and child. John Ripa studied the movements of young chimpanzees to use for young Tarzan's animation.<ref name=\"Green\" /> [[Brian Blessed]] provided the [[Tarzan yell]], while Goldwyn provided Tarzan's speaking voice.\n:*[[Alex D.

Smith]] served as the supervising animator for Kerchak.\n* [[Brian Blessed]] as [[William Cecil Clayton|William Clayton]], an intelligent and suave - yet arrogant and treacherous - hunter, who guides the Porters on their quest. Randy Haycock served as the supervising animator for Clayton, basing his design on [[Clark Gable]] and other film stars of the 1930s and 40s.<ref name=\"Green\" />\n* [[Nigel Hawthorne]] as Professor Archimedes Q. Porter, an eccentric, short-statured scientist and Jane's father. Dave Burgess served as the supervising animator for Porter.

For the third act, Murphy suggested that Tarzan should leave for England, as he did in the book, but the directors felt that it was incompatible with their central theme of what defines a family. In order to keep Tarzan in the jungle, the third act needed to be restructured by redefining the role of the villain and inventing a way to endanger the gorillas.<ref name=\"Green\" /> In this departure from Burrough's novel, a villain named Clayton was created to serve as a guide for Professor Archimedes Q. Porter and his daughter, Jane. In addition to this, Kerchak was re-characterized from a savage silverback into the protector of the gorilla tribe.<ref name=\"Global_Perspectives\" />\n\nIn January 1997, husband-and-wife screenwriting duo [[Bob Tzudiker]] and [[Noni White]] were hired to help refocus and add humor to the script as a way to balance the emotional weight of the film.<ref name=\"Global_Perspectives\" /> Comedy writer [[David Reynolds (screenwriter)|Dave Reynolds]] was also brought on to write humorous dialogue for the film.<ref name=\"Animation Artist\">{{cite news| url=http://www.animationartist.com/movies/tarzan/Production/production.html | title=Disney's Tarzan Adventure: Two Worlds Merge | last=Tracy | first=Joe | publisher=Animation Artist | accessdate=October 16, 2014}}</ref> \"I was initially hired on for six weeks of rewriting and punch-up\", Reynolds said, \"A year and a half later, I finished.

The 6000-mile distance and difference in time zones posed challenges for collaboration, especially for scenes with Tarzan and Jane. [[Glen Keane]] was the supervising animator for Tarzan at the Paris studio, while Ken Duncan was the supervising animator for Jane at the studio in Burbank. To make coordinating scenes with multiple characters easier, the animators used a system called a \"scene machine\" that could send rough drawings between the two animation studios.<ref name=\"Green\" /> Meanwhile, following production on ''[[Mulan (1998 film)|Mulan]]'', two hundred animators at the [[Animation studios owned by The Walt Disney Company#Walt Disney Feature Animation Florida|Feature Animation Florida satellite studio]] provided character animation and special effects animation where the filmmakers had to discuss their work through daily video conferences among the three studios.<ref>{{cite news|last=Abbott|first=Jim|url=http://articles.orlandosentinel.com/1999-06-08/lifestyle/9906070397_1_animated-tarzan-keane-character|title=A Fresh Tarzan|newspaper=Orlando Sentinel|date=June 8, 1999|accessdate=September 11, 2015}}</ref>\n\nKeane was inspired to make Tarzan \"surf\" through the trees because of his son's interest in extreme sports, and he began working on a test scene. The directors expressed concern that Tarzan would be made into a \"surfer dude\", but when Keane revealed the test animation to them they liked it enough to use it in the film during the \"Son of Man\" sequence, with movements inspired by skateboarder [[Tony Hawk]]. Although Keane initially thought that Tarzan would be easy to animate because he only wears a loincloth, he realized that he would need a fully working human musculature while still being able to move like an animal. To figure out Tarzan's movements, the Paris animation team studied different animals in order to transpose their movements onto him. They also consulted with a professor of anatomy. This resulted in Tarzan being the first Disney character to accurately display working muscles.<ref name=\"Green\" />\n\nTo prepare for animating the gorillas, the animation team attended lectures on primates, made trips to zoos, and studied nature documentaries, with a group of animators also witnessing a gorilla dissection to learn about their musculature. In 1996, the animation team went on a two-week safari in Kenya to take reference photographs and observe the animals. On the trip, they visited [[Bwindi Impenetrable National Park]] in Uganda to view mountain gorillas in the wild, and get inspiration for the setting.<ref name=\"Green\" /> In 2000, Chris Buck repeated the journey accompanied by journalists to promote the film's home video release.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Falk|first1=Quentin|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/HOLIDAYS%3A+Close+encounter+of+the+hairy+kind.-a064964720|title=Holidays: Close encounter of the hairy kind|accessdate=August 30, 2014|work=Sunday Mirror|publisher=MGN Ltd.|date=September 3, 2000|page=53}} Available through [[ProQuest]] Historical Newsstand.</ref>\n\nTo create the sweeping 3D backgrounds, ''Tarzan''{{'}}s production team developed a 3D painting and rendering technique known as ''Deep Canvas'' (a term coined by artist/engineer Eric Daniels).<ref name=\"Essman\" /> This technique allows artists to produce [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] background that looks like a traditional painting, according to art director [[Daniel St. Pierre]].<ref name=\"Essman\" /> (The software keeps track of brushstrokes applied in 3D space.)<ref name=\"Essman\">{{cite web |url=http://www.moviemaker.com/directing/article/state_of_the_art_of_fx_3271/ |title=State of the Art of F/X |accessdate=April 6, 2009 |last=Essman |first=Scott |date=July 5, 1999 |publisher=MovieMaker Magazine |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090606210336/http://www.moviemaker.com/directing/article/state_of_the_art_of_fx_3271/ |archivedate=June 6, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> For this advancement, the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] awarded the creators of ''Deep Canvas'' a Technical Achievement Award in 2003.

It gets its title from a location [[Puri]] on the shores of the [[Bay of Bengal]] which is a popular tourist attraction in East India. It was first serialized in the [[Sandesh magazine]] in 1979 and released in book form in the same year by Ananda Publishers.\n\n==Plot==\nDisturbed by the heat and humidity of Calcutta in June, (combined with frequent electricity failures) the \"Three Musketeers\", Pradosh C. Mitter (Feluda), Topshe, and Lalmohon Babu (alias Jatayu) go to [[Puri]] for vacation. There they stay in Neelachal Hotel, which was owned by Lalmohan Babu's landlord's classmate, Shyamlal Barik. In the evening, while strolling on the beach, the trio spot footprints on the sand, with a smaller mark on the sides of the footprints. Then Lalmohan Babu goes to meete an astrologer, Laxman Bhattacharya, who can tell everything about the person by touching the forehead of the particular person. Bhattacharya lives in a building called \"Sagarika\". In the hotel, Shyamlal Barik comes to their room and tells them that the house is owned by one D.G. Sen. Nobody knows his full name. Shyamlal further tells that Sen's main interest is in collecting manuscripts. \n\nNext morning, while strolling on the beach, Topshe and Lalmohan Babu spot a dead body lying on the beach. They tell the news to Feluda, who in turn calls the police. He tells the two of them that he has fixed an appointment with D.G. Sen. While going to Sagarika, they spot a small crowd on the beach. There they find Inspector Mahapatra, whom Feluda was acquainted previously on a case. Mahapatra tells them that the victim's name is Rupchand Singh, who had been identified by his driving license. He had come to [[Puri]] from [[Nepal]]. He had been shot dead, but the weapon was not found. The \"Three Musketeers\" then go to Sagarika and meet Nisith Bose, D.G. Sen's secretary.\n\nNisith tells them that the full name of his employer is Durga Gati Sen. He is now suffering from [[gout]]. They meet Mr. Sen in the terrace of his house. Mr. Sen shows them many manuscripts, of which the most famous and the oldest ones were the ''Ashtadashasahasrika Pragya Paramita'' and ''Kalpasutra''. He also tells them that he does not sell these manuscripts. The trio then come out of the house. While walking on the beach, they meet a man named Bilas Majumdar. He introduces himself as a famous photographer. They come back to the hotel, where Majumdar tells them his story.\n\nBilas tells that 8 months back, Mr. Sen and he had gone to Nepal, for a photography session. So one morning they went to a forest, where Majumdar was clicking photos of [[orchids]]. Then he had a serious accident but he cannot remember what it was. But fortunately, his life was saved. But he could remember nothing. He had broken a few bones. After telling his story, Lalmohan Babu tells him to consult Laxman Bhattacharya, the astrologer. So they agree to consult Laxman Bhattacharya next evening.\n\nNext day evening, Feluda, Topshe and Lalmohan Babu take a trip around Puri. On the way, they meet Inspector Mahapatra. He tells him that Rupchand Singh arrived yesterday in Puri. Then the trio and Bilash Majumdar go to The astrologer's house. There the astrologer tells him that the rock was pushed by a person. This means there was a murder attempt on Majumdar. Then, the four of them go to the Railway Hotel to have dinner, where Lalmohan Babu tells him to meet D.G. Sen tomorrow. While returning to the hotel, they meet Mahesh Hingorani, who had travelled with them to Puri in the same train. He tells them that he had offered 25,000 rupees for the ''Pragya Paramita'' but he refused. Hingorani then walks of in disgust.\n\nNext morning Feluda and Topshe go to the [[Puri railway station]] to buy newspaper. There they meet Nisith Bose. He tells them that a man had come today at Mr. Sen's house. On seeing the man, Mr. Sen told him to get out at once. Feluda believes that the man was Bilash Majumdar. Nisith Bose then hurries out of the station. Feluda and Topshe come to the hotel to find Majumdar waiting for them. He tells them that he had gone to Mr. Sen's home. Mr. Sen seemed to recognize him and then told him to go back. He tells them that next day, he is leaving Puri. Majumdar leaves them, while Topshe and Lalmohan Babu go to [[Bhubaneshwar]]. They return to Puri in the evening, to find Feluda had gone out. They wait for him but they become restless. They go out in search for him. Suddenly, Lalmohan Babu stumbles on something. Topshe sees that Feluda was lying unconscious on the beach. They help him to his feet and go back to the hotel. Feluda's head was bleeding. In the hotel, Shyamlal brings in a man, who introduces himself as Mahim Sen, Mr. Sen's son. Mahim Sen tells them that he had come to Puri to meet his father. Feluda tells him that one of the most valuable manuscripts from Mr. Sen's collection is missing and the secretary, i.e., Nisith Bose is missing. When Mahim goes out of the hotel, Feluda tells Topshe that Nisith took all his bedding with him but left his wallet in his room.\n\nNext morning, they go to a house named \"Bhujanga Niwas\", which is near Sagarika. Inside the house, Lalmohan Babu find the dead body of Nisith Bose. He was stuck on the head with a blunt instrument. Feluda tells Topshe and Lalmohan Babu that tonight, they have keep a vigil in front of Sagarika. In the night, in a thrilling climax, Feluda catches the culprits, Bilas Majumdar and Laxman Bhattacharya.\n\nFeluda gathers everyone in Bhujanga Niwas and tells everyone that Bilas Majumdar is actually Mr. A. Sarkar, who is a smuggler by profession. Feluda told him that the actual Bilas Majumdar had died three weeks ago in a hospital in Nepal. Feluda tells that he had actually pushed Mr. Sen from the cliff. But the driver of the car he was in, Rupchand Singh, started blackmailing him. So Sarkar killed him. He  came to Puri and when he saw D.G. Sen here, he joined hands with Laxman Bhattacharya to help him steal the manuscripts. But Nisith Bose had actually seen him doing this. So Bhattacharya killed him with the hard manuscript, and later he threw the manuscript into the sea. Before throwing it into the sea, Bhattacharya saw Feluda and attacked him with the blood-soaked manuscript. Tonight they were planning to make another robbery, but they got caught. Feluda returns the ''Pragya Paramita'' to Mr. Sen and tells him that the Nulias had retrieved the manuscript from the sea. Inspector Mahapatra arrests the culprits.\n\nNext morning, Feluda and Co. goes to Sagarika, where he tells Mr. Sen that he was the one who was roaming in the beach with his walking stick. He actually did not suffer from gout. Mr. Sen then shows them his wooden leg.\n\n==Characters==\n* Pradosh Chandra Mitter aka.[[Feluda]], the private investigator.\n* Tapesh Ranjan Mitra aka.

The director with whom he is collaborating fails to appear and hears reports from home in the U.S. about infidelity and suicide. Rather than abandon the project, Howard stays and starts work on a novel. He gets to know Francis J. Adams, an aging American propagandist, and Anders Jensen, a Danish\nhomosexual painter. While waiting for a letter from his New York girlfriend, he settled on a plot for his projected novel, the story of a banker who forges documents to steal money he then gives to the poor. One night, Ingham finds someone breaking into his apartment. He throws his typewriter at the intruder, possibly killing him. The body is dragged away by the intruder's accomplices.

During 1981, work commenced at MBB on developing a design for a viable stealth aircraft; the effort was supported by a contract that had been issued by the [[German Air Force]]. Also known as the ''Medium Range Missile Fighter'' (MRMF), it had been conceived that a fighter could be both lighter and cheaper if it was so superior at mid-range combat as to allow it to discard the requirement to perform close-range combat. Having been developed independently of other [[stealth aircraft]], such as the American [[Lockheed Corporation]]'s [[Have Blue]] technical demonstrator and its follow-up [[Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk|F-117 Nighthawk]] [[stealth aircraft|stealth attack aircraft]], the Lampyridae nonetheless used a similar approach to achieving its low-observable characteristics.\n\nAfter determining the Lampyridae's design to be viable, development activity proceeded to the construction of a single three-quarter scale piloted aircraft. During 1985, [[wind tunnel]] testing of the design, including at [[transonic]] speeds commenced; two years later, a number of manned 'flights' inside the wind tunnel were performed, during which the favourable high-quality aerodynamic properties of the design. During 1987, the existence of the Lampyridae project and its design was revealed to the [[United States]] in the form of a group of [[United States Air Force]] (USAF) officers, who were shown the piloted model, which was kept in a closed-off section of MBB's manufacturing facility at [[Ottobrunn]], [[Bavaria]], Germany. That same year, the Lampyridae project was terminated for unspecified reasons; diplomatic pressure on the part of the US has been attributed.\n\n==Development==\n===Background===\nDuring the 1970s and 1980s, several nations, having recognised the potential strategic value of [[stealth aircraft|low-observably]], commenced research into the application of such technologies with the aim of developing viable [[stealth aircraft]] for military purposes. During this time, American aircraft manufacturer [[Lockheed Corporation]] was developing such aircraft in the form of the [[Have Blue]] technical demonstrator along with a subsequent production type in the form of the [[Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk|F-117 Nighthawk]], a stealthy [[Attack aircraft|strike aircraft]]. Amongst the other nations working on such matters was [[West Germany]]; as early as 1975, the country had commenced its own independent research efforts into the field.<ref>Hasik 2008, p. 47.</ref>\n\nDuring 1981, German aerospace manufacturer [[Messerschmitt-B\u00f6lkow-Blohm]] (MBB) commenced work on its own stealth aircraft research programme.<ref name = \"jane lamp\"/><ref name = \"FI 95\">[https://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/germany-reveals-secret-stealth-fighter-research-22117/ \"Germany reveals secret Stealth fighter research.\"] ''Flight International'', 8 March 1995.</ref> This programme, which has been mainly known by the name ''Lampyridae'' (Latin for ''Fireflies''), or alternatively as the ''Medium Range Missile Fighter'' (MRMF), was conducted by MBB under the terms of a contract issued by the [[German Air Force]].<ref name = \"FI 95\"/><ref>Hasik 2008, pp. 47-48.</ref> According to aerospace publication [[Flight International]], the MRMF programme had been motivated by the concept that a future fighter could be both lighter and cheaper if it could be so superior at mid-range combat that it could completely eliminate the need to perform any close-range [[dogfight]]ing-style combat. As such, MBB was required to develop an airframe which possessed a suitable configuration to achieve a forward-facing [[radar cross-section]] that would be between 20-30dB (in the [[X band]] [[frequency|frequencies]]) below that of what a conventional fighter would typically achieve.<ref name = \"FI 95\"/>\n\nSimilar to Lockheed's own approach adopted during its development of the Have Blue demonstrated and production F-117 Nighthawk, MBB's design team harnesses the dimensional principles of an airframe externally covered by [[Polyhedron|polyhedral]] shapes for the Lampyridae.<ref name = \"FI 95\"/> These shapes deliberately avoid both conventional right angles and curved surfaces, alternatively, [[lift (force)|lift]] was generated via a system of vortices produced by its sharp leading edges. This multi-faceted exterior formed the basis of the envisaged stealth fighter; according to claims by Dr Gerhard Lobert, a former project leader at MBB, the Lampyridae was highly likely to have possessed superior low-observability (in terms of radar visibility) characteristics than the competing F-117 Nighthawk, despite the latter's exterior featuring more than double the number of radar-scattering facets in comparison to MBB's design.<ref name = \"FI 95\"/>\n\n===Testing===\nHaving developed a suitable design for such an aircraft, development activity on the Lampyridae programme proceeded to the construction of a single three-quarter scale piloted model of the aircraft.<ref name = \"FI 95\"/> This model was initially used for a series of [[wind tunnel]] tests.

Further evaluation of the aircraft's radar cross-section was performed using a full-scale model, totalling 16 meters in length.<ref name = \"FI 95\"/>\n\nFollowing the completion of preparatory work using a [[flight simulator]], it is known that the manned 3/4-scale model performed at least 15 individual 'flights' inside the German-Dutch wind tunnel at [[Emmeloord]], [[Flevoland]], the [[Netherlands]], during 1987. In the course of these test, complete flight cycles were simulated within the tunnel's 9.5&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup> test section; the Lampyridae was recorded as having flown at speeds of up to 120&nbsp;kt (220&nbsp;km/h) and having performing various small-amplitude movements across all axes.<ref name = \"FI 95\"/>\n\n===Termination and aftermath===\nThe Lampyridae programme was conducted between 1981 and 1987.
