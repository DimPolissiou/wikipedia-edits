This university is known in historiography in different ways: Complutense University, Cisneriana University, University of Alcal\u00e1 ... and reached, together with the [[University of Salamanca]], a pre-eminent place among the Castilian universities during the [[Spanish Golden Age|Golden Age]]. However, it later entered a period of decline until in 1836 the government decreed its transfer to Madrid, renamed [[Central University of Madrid]]. This, in 1970, adopted the name of [[Complutense University of Madrid]]. The Complutense University of Madrid, in accordance with such historical trajectory, shows continuity with the university founded by Cisneros in 1499.<ref>[http://www.ucm.es/?d=0000624 Universidad Complutense de Madrid.

The University would be known under this name until its original name of \"Complutense\" was restored in the 1970s.\n\n=== Restoration ===\n\nIn 1975, after years of the buildings passing between various businesses, Complutense University opened its Alcal\u00e1 branch as a means to decongest its growing student population.  In 1977, the university was re-founded as \"the University of Alcal\u00e1 de Henares,\" which later was shortened to \"the University of Alcal\u00e1\" in 1996.

The University has added to its time-honoured education in the humanities and social sciences new degree subjects in scientific fields such as health sciences or engineering, spread out across its different sites (the Alcal\u00e1 Campus, the Science and Technology Campus and [[Guadalajara, Spain|Guadalajara]]), all of which, together with the Science and Technology Park, are a key factor in its projection abroad, while also acting as a dynamo for activities in its local region.\n\n==Spanish language programs==\nBecause of its rich tradition in the humanities, the University of Alcal\u00e1 offers several programs in Spanish language and literature. Alcalingua, a Department of the University of Alcal\u00e1, offers Spanish language and culture courses to foreigners and develops materials for teaching Spanish as a foreign language. The University of Alcal\u00e1, together with EDUESPA\u00d1A, grants the CEELE, ''Certificado de Calidad en la Ense\u00f1anza del Espa\u00f1ol como Lengua Extranjera'' (Quality Certificate for Teaching Spanish as a Foreign Language).\n\n==International agreements==\nThe University of Alcal\u00e1 is a party to various bilateral agreements with institutions in non-European countries, above all with universities in Latin America and the USA. Some of these agreements stipulate exchanges for first and second stage students. Like Erasmus Programme students, foreign students who take advantage of these exchange schemes are exempt of payment of tuition fees to the University of Alcal\u00e1, though they must meet their own costs of travel, accommodation and upkeep.\nApplication to take part in these exchanges should be carried out in the university of origin. Once selected, the university of origin will inform the University of Alcal\u00e1.\n\n==Undergraduate studies==\nThe University of Alcal\u00e1 offers degrees in five branches of knowledge: Arts and Humanities, Law and Social Sciences, Sciences, Health Sciences, and Engineering and Architecture.

Here, as well as the long-standing Escuela de Magisterio (primary education teacher-training college) and the Castilla-La Mancha Health Service Nursing College, both attached to the University, may be found the Multi-departmental Building, which is home for Technical Architecture, Business Science, and Tourism.\n\nThe University of Alcal\u00e1 has a network of 14 libraries spread across its three campuses. They offer extended hours year-round and during exam periods they never close.\n\nThe university also offers a wide range of sporting activities, including aikido, archery, badminton, fencing, rugby and yoga. There are also courses in snorkelling, horseriding and mountaineering, as well as other popular sports such as football.\n\nThe university has a hall for music, dance, theatre or flamenco, as well as the university choir, \"La Tuna\" (a traditional student music group), and the Film Club.\n\n==Architecture==\n{{See also|Colegio Mayor de San Ildefonso}}\nMany buildings on the [[Campus of Texas Tech University|campus]] of [[Texas Tech University]] in [[Lubbock, Texas]] borrow [[Architecture of the Spanish Renaissance|architectural elements]] from those found at the University of Alcal\u00e1.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Barrick|first=Nolan|title=Texas Tech...

This university is known in historiography in different ways: Complutense University, Cisneriana University, University of Alcal\u00e1 ... and reached, together with the [[University of Salamanca]], a pre-eminent place among the Castilian universities during the [[Spanish Golden Age|Golden Age]]. However, it later entered a period of decline until in 1836 the government decreed its transfer to Madrid, renamed [[Central University of Madrid]]. This, in 1970, adopted the name of [[Complutense University of Madrid]]. The Complutense University of Madrid, in accordance with such historical trajectory, shows continuity with the university founded by Cisneros in 1499.<ref>[http://www.ucm.es/?d=0000624 Universidad Complutense de Madrid.

The University would be known under this name until its original name of \"Complutense\" was restored in the 1970s.\n\n=== Restoration ===\n\nIn 1975, after years of the buildings passing between various businesses, Complutense University opened its Alcal\u00e1 branch as a means to decongest its growing student population.  In 1977, the university was re-founded as \"the University of Alcal\u00e1 de Henares,\" which later was shortened to \"the University of Alcal\u00e1\" in 1996.

The University has added to its time-honoured education in the humanities and social sciences new degree subjects in scientific fields such as health sciences or engineering, spread out across its different sites (the Alcal\u00e1 Campus, the Science and Technology Campus and [[Guadalajara, Spain|Guadalajara]]), all of which, together with the Science and Technology Park, are a key factor in its projection abroad, while also acting as a dynamo for activities in its local region.\n\n==Spanish language programs==\nBecause of its rich tradition in the humanities, the University of Alcal\u00e1 offers several programs in Spanish language and literature. Alcalingua, a Department of the University of Alcal\u00e1, offers Spanish language and culture courses to foreigners and develops materials for teaching Spanish as a foreign language. The University of Alcal\u00e1, together with EDUESPA\u00d1A, grants the CEELE, ''Certificado de Calidad en la Ense\u00f1anza del Espa\u00f1ol como Lengua Extranjera'' (Quality Certificate for Teaching Spanish as a Foreign Language).\n\n==International agreements==\nThe University of Alcal\u00e1 is a party to various bilateral agreements with institutions in non-European countries, above all with universities in Latin America and the USA. Some of these agreements stipulate exchanges for first and second stage students. Like Erasmus Programme students, foreign students who take advantage of these exchange schemes are exempt of payment of tuition fees to the University of Alcal\u00e1, though they must meet their own costs of travel, accommodation and upkeep.\nApplication to take part in these exchanges should be carried out in the university of origin. Once selected, the university of origin will inform the University of Alcal\u00e1.\n\n==Undergraduate studies==\nThe University of Alcal\u00e1 offers degrees in five branches of knowledge: Arts and Humanities, Law and Social Sciences, Sciences, Health Sciences, and Engineering and Architecture.

Both the prison-probation review and the Comprehensive Spending Review should result in steps which should improve public confidence in community penalties.\"<ref>Annual report 1998/1999, paragraph 13.15</ref>\n\nThe Home Office Prison-Probation review consultation paper<ref>Prison- Probation Review: Home Office (August 1998)</ref> did not mention family court welfare given that family court welfare was to move to a new unified family court welfare service.<ref>Support Services in Family Proceedings \u2013 Future Organisation of Court Welfare Services (Department of Health, Home Office, Lord Chancellor\u2019s Department, Welsh Office) (July 1998): Consultation closed on 13 November 1998.</ref>\n\nThe government then announced a unified family court welfare service.<ref>House of Lords July 27, 1999</ref> Among many key to be addressed were ensuring:\n* Cafcass statutory basis;\n* Funding to cover start-up, transitional and ongoing costs; \n* Change management of the merger of 114 autonomous bodies into a single organisation\n* Maintenance of current casework.\n\nThese were addressed by a Project Team.<ref>The Project Team was drawn from the three relevant government departments supplemented by consultants dealing with, for example, IT, payroll, estates and finance.</ref>\n\nThe Criminal Justice and Court Services Bill<ref>Presented to the House of Commons on March 15, 2000.</ref> was led by the Home Office as most of the Bill\u2019s provisions concerned the establishment of a National Probation Service for England and Wales.

These standards set out what service users, partner agencies and practitioners in the family justice system could expect. The Standards updated the 2003 Cafcass Service Standards and Principles, and after piloting in the North-East Region, were phased in from 1 April 2007.\n \nThe standards noted the importance of service-user feedback and the active engagement and participation of children in their case planning process. Cafcass asserted the importance of including children's views in the decision making processes involved in court proceedings. Young people could offer a \"Needs, Wishes and Feelings\" statement directly to the judge. However, Cafcass admitted{{according to whom|date=September 2015}} that they do not conform to any National Standards.\n\nThe Children's Rights Team spearheaded the formation of a Young People's Board for Cafcass. This Board consists of 12 young people with experience of Cafcass's services. Since the Board's formation in August 2006 they helped to shape Cafcass policies and procedures.\n\nIn 2011 the Family Justice Review, in its final report, stated the following about the Young People\u2019s Board:\n\n\u2018''We have been impressed by the valuable work undertaken by the Cafcass Young People\u2019s Board. They provide an important perspective on the work of the family justice system and offer an intelligent and energetic challenge to the board of Cafcass. We believe that this work should be maintained through a Young People\u2019s Board for the Family Justice Service, with a remit to consider issues in both public and private law and to report directly to the service.\u2019''<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/217343/family-justice-review-final-report.pdf |title=Family Justice Review Final Report |date=November 2011 |website=www.gov.uk |accessdate=October 20, 2016 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102025004/https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/217343/family-justice-review-final-report.pdf |archivedate=November 2, 2013 |df=mdy }}</ref>\n\nThe Young People\u2019s Board was expanded to cover the family justice system on a national scale and is now called The Family Justice Young People's Board.

Demosceners rarely use their real names in demoscene contexts. This is a tradition originating from the demoscene's roots, where small demos were distributed along with cracked software, usually computer games.\n\nMany demogroups have been founded by friends who already knew each other in real life. However, there have also been groups that have taken their form online via [[Bulletin Board System]]s or the Internet. Perhaps the most important way for demogroups to communicate is [[Internet Relay Chat|IRC]]. Demosceners from different groups also meet each other in real life at [[demoparty|demoparties]] and smaller meetings.\n\nDemogroups often bear resemblances to corporate companies: demogroups incorporate [[wordmark]]s, [[logo]]s, [[catchphrase]]s, and [[slogan]]s for their promotion. It is very important for a demogroup to have good PR, and major groups have dedicated group organisers who are responsible for \"managing the group's human resources\", i.e. nag the members who slack off. Some groups also treat the recruitment of new members with great care, often applying \"trial periods\" in which the new member has to prove himself to be worthy. However these practices are often just intentional exaggeration (often [[tongue-in-cheek]]), to maintain an \"elite\" image for the group.\n\nA group is perhaps the most important [[social unit]] in the demoscene, and belonging to a group is often considered more or less synonymous to being a demoscener. Even individual productions, with no group activity involved, are typically associated with the group of the creative individual. There have even been several \"one-man groups\" when an individual demomaker with no group has wanted to release a demo or intro.\n\n==Demography==\nThe countries with the most active demogroups and [[demoparty|demoparties]] are currently the [[Nordic countries]] ([[Norway]], [[Sweden]], [[Finland]] and [[Denmark]]), [[Germany]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Hungary]] and [[France]].\n\nDue to the community-like nature of the demoscene, multi-national demogroups are not uncommon.\n\n==Demoscener functions==\nDemosceners specialize themselves into various categories to be able to take part in the demomaking process. A few people are able to cross over between multiple archetypes (e.g. coder-musician, musician-designer), but this is by no means a trend.\n\n===Coder===\nThe coder is the demogroup's programmer who creates the demo's software framework and is responsible for the actual realtime state of the demo. While some coders specialize in developing system-level functionality (such as providing wrappers and [[application programming interface|API]]s for other coders to base their code on), others code effects which are usually visual representations of mathematical formulas, such as [[fractal]]s or [[metaballs]].\n\nIn the 1990s, coders were most often entirely responsible for the demo's flow and arrangement, including the effect's synchronization to the music and sometimes even the design. Nowadays, software tools known as ''demotools'' are widely used, allowing this work to be done by a designer who does not have to be a coder. Many groups, however, still prefer that the coder takes most of the responsibility in the demomaking process, including the design.\n\nIn many cases, an attempt for excelling in several areas has resulted in one area outshadowing the others: for instance, coders who try to make music often come up with \"coder music\" which may be technically passable but lacks artistic ambitions. \"Coder graphics\" and \"coder palettes\" are similar terms for graphics and color schemes.\n\n===Graphic artist===\nGraphic artists (or ''graphicians'' in scene [[Jargon|lingo]]) create the visual coherency behind a demo, which include still pictures, design elements, fonts, colors, 3D objects, textures and animation.\n\nOriginally, there was a single type of graphician creating typical 2D graphics (referred to as pixeled graphics because they were typically created pixel by pixel). Ever since demos started using complex (as in, much more elaborate than cubes and donuts) 3D graphics, graphicians that exclusively model 3D graphics are also around, sometimes referred to as (3D) modelers.\n\n===Musicians===\nMusicians are responsible for the composing, arranging, mixing and mastering (and in some cases, performing) the soundtracks and sound effects in the demo.\n\nIn the older days, musicians worked with [[Tracker (music software)|tracker]]s, and the world of tracked music was heavily dominated by demoscene musicians. In later times, it became possible for the PC demos to use streaming, high-quality music formats, and the musicians started to gradually change their tools to professional [[music sequencer]]s. However, tracked music and other specialized formats still continue to be used in size-restricted intros as well as demos written for more restrictive platforms such as mobile devices and vintage computers.\n\n==Fake groups==\nDemosceners often form fake groups, which are essentially [[secret identity|secret identities]] for making humorous or vulgar productions without scathing their original reputation - people in a fake group hide behind a [[pseudonym]] (which, considering their demoscene handles, usually becomes a pseudo-pseudonym). This type of masquerading is often just performed to confuse na\u00efve newcomers to the scene; while some fake identities are never revealed for their time of activity, in most cases a large portion of unrelated people are aware of the real persons behind the spoof.\n\n==\"One-man\" groups==\nThough they are not strictly \"demogroups\" by definition, the scene always had various individuals who excelled in all areas of demomaking; rather than gathering various other persons to aid them in a creative process, they do all of the programming, music making and visual art themselves. While the obvious disadvantage of this type of working is the multiple of amount of work one must do with a given quality standard, one-man groups usually point out that having no others to work with gets rid of discussions and creative differences alike, and is actually a very free way of working.\n\nOne-man groups are usually treated with a mix of respect and curiosity within the scene, because they're not an extremely common phenomenon, and some of the scene marks them as an unnecessary effort for virtuosity, largely because it is virtually impossible to perform above average in all areas - one-man demos and intros usually bear obvious lacks in given areas, depending on whether the creator was more a coder, graphician or musician, who adapted other skillsets later.\n\nPerhaps the most successful one-man army of the demoscene is [http://and.intercon.ru/index.php?id=about Dmitry \"AND\" Andreev], two-time winner of the [[Assembly (demo party)|Assembly demo party]] in the [[64k Intro|64k intro]] category.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Amiga}}\n* [[Social group]]\n* [[Warez group]]\n\n== References ==\n* {{cite web|last=Williams|first=Jeremy|title=Demographics: Behind the Scene|url=http://vimeo.com/1289141|work=Mindcandy Volume 1: PC Demos|accessdate=2012-05-19}}\n* {{cite book|title=DEMOSCENE: the Art of Real-Time|last=Tasaj\u00e4rvi|first=Lassi|year=2004|publisher=Evenlake Studios|isbn=952-91-7022-X}}\n* {{cite web|url=http://areena.yle.fi/tv/1295277|title=Demoscene-dokumentti|author=[[Yleisradio]]|date=2010|accessdate=30 August 2014|language=fi}}\n<!-- sources listed in Demoscene article may also be of use if you're working on inline citations for this article -->\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.pouet.net/groups.php Demogroups] at Pou\u00ebt\n*  http://www.demoscene.info/demogroups/\n\n[[Category:Demogroups|*]]\n[[Category:Demoscene]]\n[[Category:Social groups]]\n", "text_old": "{{multiple issues|\n{{notability|date=August 2014}}\n{{refimprove|date=July 2007}}\n}}\n{{Demoscene}}\n'''Demogroups''' are teams of '''demosceners''', who make computer based audio-visual works of art known as [[Demo (computer programming)|demos]].

While some coders specialize in developing system-level functionality (such as providing wrappers and [[application programming interface|API]]s for other coders to base their code on), others code effects which are usually visual representations of mathematical formulas, such as [[fractal]]s or [[metaballs]].\n\nIn the 1990s, coders were most often entirely responsible for the demo's flow and arrangement, including the effect's synchronization to the music and sometimes even the design. Nowadays, software tools known as ''demotools'' are widely used, allowing this work to be done by a designer who does not have to be a coder. Many groups, however, still prefer that the coder takes most of the responsibility in the demomaking process, including the design.\n\nIn many cases, an attempt for excelling in several areas has resulted in one area outshadowing the others: for instance, coders who try to make music often come up with \"coder music\" which may be technically passable but lacks artistic ambitions. \"Coder graphics\" and \"coder palettes\" are similar terms for graphics and color schemes.\n\n===Graphic artist===\nGraphic artists (or ''graphicians'' in scene [[Jargon|lingo]]) create the visual coherency behind a demo, which include still pictures, design elements, fonts, colors, 3D objects, textures and animation.\n\nOriginally, there was a single type of graphician creating typical 2D graphics (referred to as pixeled graphics because they were typically created pixel by pixel). Ever since demos started using complex (as in, much more elaborate than cubes and donuts) 3D graphics, graphicians that exclusively model 3D graphics are also around, sometimes referred to as (3D) modelers.\n\n===Musicians===\nMusicians are responsible for the composing, arranging, mixing and mastering (and in some cases, performing) the soundtracks and sound effects in the demo.\n\nIn the older days, musicians worked with [[Tracker (music software)|tracker]]s, and the world of tracked music was heavily dominated by demoscene musicians. In later times, it became possible for the PC demos to use streaming, high-quality music formats, and the musicians started to gradually change their tools to professional [[music sequencer]]s. However, tracked music and other specialized formats still continue to be used in size-restricted intros as well as demos written for more restrictive platforms such as mobile devices and vintage computers.\n\n==Fake groups==\nDemosceners often form fake groups, which are essentially [[secret identity|secret identities]] for making humorous or vulgar productions without scathing their original reputation - people in a fake group hide behind a [[pseudonym]] (which, considering their demoscene handles, usually becomes a pseudo-pseudonym). This type of masquerading is often just performed to confuse na\u00efve newcomers to the scene; while some fake identities are never revealed for their time of activity, in most cases a large portion of unrelated people are aware of the real persons behind the spoof.\n\n==\"One-man\" groups==\nThough they are not strictly \"demogroups\" by definition, the scene always had various individuals who excelled in all areas of demomaking; rather than gathering various other persons to aid them in a creative process, they do all of the programming, music making and visual art themselves. While the obvious disadvantage of this type of working is the multiple of amount of work one must do with a given quality standard, one-man groups usually point out that having no others to work with gets rid of discussions and creative differences alike, and is actually a very free way of working.\n\nOne-man groups are usually treated with a mix of respect and curiosity within the scene, because they're not an extremely common phenomenon, and some of the scene marks them as an unnecessary effort for virtuosity, largely because it is virtually impossible to perform above average in all areas - one-man demos and intros usually bear obvious lacks in given areas, depending on whether the creator was more a coder, graphician or musician, who adapted other skillsets later.\n\nPerhaps the most successful one-man army of the demoscene is [http://and.intercon.ru/index.php?id=about Dmitry \"AND\" Andreev], two-time winner of the [[Assembly (demo party)|Assembly demo party]] in the [[64k Intro|64k intro]] category.\n\n== See also ==\n{{Portal|Amiga}}\n* [[Social group]]\n* [[Warez group]]\n\n== References ==\n* {{cite web|last=Williams|first=Jeremy|title=Demographics: Behind the Scene|url=http://vimeo.com/1289141|work=Mindcandy Volume 1: PC Demos|accessdate=2012-05-19}}\n* {{cite book|title=DEMOSCENE: the Art of Real-Time|last=Tasaj\u00e4rvi|first=Lassi|year=2004|publisher=Evenlake Studios|isbn=952-91-7022-X}}\n* {{cite web|url=http://areena.yle.fi/tv/1295277|title=Demoscene-dokumentti|author=[[Yleisradio]]|date=2010|accessdate=30 August 2014|language=fi}}\n<!-- sources listed in Demoscene article may also be of use if you're working on inline citations for this article -->\n\n==External links==\n*[http://www.pouet.net/groups.php Demogroups] at Pou\u00ebt\n*  http://www.demoscene.info/demogroups/\n\n[[Category:Demogroups|*]]\n[[Category:Demoscene]]\n[[Category:Social groups]]\n", "name_user": "Useight", "label": "safe", "comment": "\u2192\u200etop:added comma", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demogroup"}

The institution was established as a [[university college (Scandinavia)|university college]] (''h\u00f8gskole'') in 1994 through the merger of Agder College and five other colleges, including a [[technical college]] and a [[nursing school]], and became one of Norway's [[new universities]] in 2007. It is among the youngest of Norway's ten universities.\n\n== History ==\nThe idea of a university in the [[Agder]] region is not completely new. In his short period as ruler of the union of [[Denmark\u2013Norway]], [[Johann Friedrich Struensee]] planned on reforming the [[University of Copenhagen]]. He gave Bishop [[Johann Ernst Gunnerus]] of [[Trondheim]] the task of developing more detailed plans. Gunnerus presented a proposal in 1771 in which he suggested establishing a new university in Norway, and placing it in Kristiansand.\n\nThe motives for suggesting Kristiansand as a university town have been debated. Regardless, the idea was soon discarded as planning began for the first Norwegian university. In 1811, a resolution was passed to establish Norway's first university in Christiania ([[Oslo]]).\n\nEven without a university in the region, and as the need for better educated employees rose, several smaller colleges were established throughout the Agder region. The first, ''Christiansands Stiftsseminarium p\u00e5 Holt'', later known as [[Kristiansand Teacher Training College]], was founded at [[Holt, Aust-Agder]] in 1839, making it one of the oldest institutions of higher education in Norway. It was followed by Arendal College of Nursing (1920), Agder Music Conservatory (1965), Agder Regional College of Technology (1967), Agder Regional College (1969) and Kristiansand College of Nursing (1976).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.uia.no/en/about-uia/facts-and-figures/vaar-historie/our-history|title=Our history -                 Universitetet i Agder|website=www.uia.no|access-date=2017-10-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171027180404/https://www.uia.no/en/about-uia/facts-and-figures/vaar-historie/our-history|archive-date=2017-10-27|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nAgder University College was established by a merger in 1994, when the six public regional colleges in the Agder counties became one institution. The University College received full university accreditation and became the University of Agder on 1 September 2007. In 2015, the University of Agder has approximately 12,000 students and 1,100 employees.\n\n== Organisation and administration ==\n\nUiA has a shared leadership. The rector is elected by the students and members of staff and faculty, who becomes the head of the university board, and is responsible for the academic programmes and activities.

The institution was established as a [[university college (Scandinavia)|university college]] (''h\u00f8gskole'') in 1994 through the merger of Agder College and five other colleges, including a [[technical college]] and a [[nursing school]], and became one of Norway's [[new universities]] in 2007. It is among the youngest of Norway's ten universities.\n\n== History ==\nThe idea of a university in the [[Agder]] region is not completely new. In his short period as ruler of the union of [[Denmark\u2013Norway]], [[Johann Friedrich Struensee]] planned on reforming the [[University of Copenhagen]]. He gave Bishop [[Johann Ernst Gunnerus]] of [[Trondheim]] the task of developing more detailed plans. Gunnerus presented a proposal in 1771 in which he suggested establishing a new university in Norway, and placing it in Kristiansand.\n\nThe motives for suggesting Kristiansand as a university town have been debated. Regardless, the idea was soon discarded as planning began for the first Norwegian university. In 1811, a resolution was passed to establish Norway's first university in Christiania ([[Oslo]]).\n\nEven without a university in the region, and as the need for better educated employees rose, several smaller colleges were established throughout the Agder region. The first, ''Christiansands Stiftsseminarium p\u00e5 Holt'', later known as [[Kristiansand Teacher Training College]], was founded at [[Holt, Aust-Agder]] in 1839, making it one of the oldest institutions of higher education in Norway. It was followed by Arendal College of Nursing (1920), Agder Music Conservatory (1965), Agder Regional College of Technology (1967), Agder Regional College (1969) and Kristiansand College of Nursing (1976).<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.uia.no/en/about-uia/facts-and-figures/vaar-historie/our-history|title=Our history -                 Universitetet i Agder|website=www.uia.no|access-date=2017-10-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171027180404/https://www.uia.no/en/about-uia/facts-and-figures/vaar-historie/our-history|archive-date=2017-10-27|url-status=dead}}</ref>\n\nAgder University College was established by a merger in 1994, when the six public regional colleges in the Agder counties became one institution. The University College received full university accreditation and became the University of Agder on 1 September 2007. In 2015, the University of Agder has approximately 12,000 students and 1,100 employees.\n\n== Organisation and administration ==\n\nUiA has a shared leadership. The rector is elected by the students and members of staff and faculty, who becomes the head of the university board, and is responsible for the academic programmes and activities. The university director is the head of administration, and is responsible for all economic and administrative affairs.\n\n== Faculties and Academia ==\n\nThe University of Agder has six faculties as
