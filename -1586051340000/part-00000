[[Jimmy Miller (producer)|Jimmy Miller]], the Stones' producer at the time, plays drums on this song instead of [[Charlie Watts]].

Each verse captures the essence of the initial optimism and eventual disillusion, followed by the resigned pragmatism of the chorus.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}\n\nUnterberger elaborated: \n{{quote|Much has been made of the lyrics reflecting the end of the overlong party that was the 1960s, as a snapshot of [[Swinging London]] burning out. That's a valid interpretation, but it should also be pointed out that there's also an uplifting and reassuring quality to the melody and performance.

The younger McMahon bought Capitol from his father in 1982, effectively seizing control of the company. Seeking to make the WWF the premier wrestling promotion in the country, and eventually, the world, he began an expansion process that fundamentally changed the wrestling business.<ref name=si>{{cite news|first=William|last=Johnson|title=Wrestling With Success|work=[[Sports Illustrated]]|date=March 25, 1991|accessdate=April 20, 2014|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1119010/2/index.htm|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130918090310/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1119010/2/index.htm|archivedate=September 18, 2013}}</ref>\n\nAt the annual meeting of the NWA in 1983, the McMahons and former Capitol employee [[Jim Barnett (wrestling)|Jim Barnett]] all withdrew from the organization.<ref name=won2011/> McMahon also worked to get WWF programming on syndicated television all across the United States. This angered other promoters and disrupted the well-established boundaries of the different wrestling promotions, eventually ending the territory system, which was in use since the founding of the NWA in the 1940s. In addition, the company used income generated by advertising, television deals, and tape sales to secure talent from rival promoters.\n\nIn an interview with ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', McMahon noted: {{bquote|In the old days, there were wrestling fiefdoms all over the country, each with its own little lord in charge. Each little lord respected the rights of his neighboring little lord. No takeovers or raids were allowed. There were maybe 30 of these tiny kingdoms in the U.S. and if I hadn't bought out my dad, there would still be 30 of them, fragmented and struggling. I, of course, had no allegiance to those little lords.<ref name=si/>}}\n\nMcMahon gained significant traction when he hired [[American Wrestling Association]] (AWA) talent [[Hulk Hogan]], who had achieved popularity outside of wrestling, notably for his appearance in the film ''[[Rocky III]]''.<ref>{{IMDb title|0084602}}</ref> McMahon signed [[Roddy Piper]] as Hogan's rival, and then shortly afterward [[Jesse Ventura]] as an announcer. Other wrestlers joined the roster, such as [[Jimmy Snuka]], [[Don Muraco]], [[The Iron Sheik]], [[Nikolai Volkoff]], [[Junkyard Dog]], [[Paul Orndorff]], [[Greg Valentine]], and [[Ricky Steamboat]]. Many of the wrestlers who would later join the WWF were former AWA or NWA talent.\n\nThe WWF would tour nationally in a venture that would require a huge capital investment, one that placed the WWF on the verge of financial collapse. The future of McMahon's experiment came down to the success or failure of McMahon's groundbreaking concept, [[WrestleMania]]. WrestleMania was a major success and was (and still is) marketed as the [[Super Bowl]] of professional wrestling. The concept of a wrestling [[Card (sports)|supercard]] was nothing new in North America; the NWA had begun running [[Starrcade]] a few years prior. In McMahon's eyes, however, what separated WrestleMania from other supercards was that it was intended to be accessible to those who did not watch wrestling. He invited celebrities such as [[Mr. T]], [[Muhammad Ali]], and [[Cyndi Lauper]] to participate in the event, as well as securing a deal with [[MTV]] to provide coverage. The event and hype surrounding it led to the term ''[[Rock 'n' Wrestling Connection]]'', due to the cross-promotion of [[popular culture]] and professional wrestling.\n\nThe WWF business expanded significantly on the shoulders of McMahon and his [[face (professional wrestling)|babyface]] hero Hulk Hogan for the next several years. The introduction of ''[[Saturday Night's Main Event]]'' on [[NBC]] in 1985 marked the first time that professional wrestling had been broadcast on network television since the 1950s, when the now-defunct [[DuMont Television Network]] broadcast matches of Vince McMahon Sr.'s Capitol Wrestling Corporation. The 1980s \"Wrestling Boom\" peaked with the [[WrestleMania III]] pay-per-view at the Pontiac Silverdome in 1987, which set an attendance record of 93,173, a record that stood for 29 years until [[WrestleMania 32]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://uk.sports.yahoo.com/news/wrestlemania-32--record-and-reputations-tumble-075620564.html|title=Wrestlemania 32: Record and reputations tumble|publisher=|accessdate=March 15, 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161007061259/https://uk.sports.yahoo.com/news/wrestlemania-32--record-and-reputations-tumble-075620564.html|archivedate=October 7, 2016}}</ref> A rematch of the WrestleMania III main event between WWF champion Hulk Hogan and [[Andr\u00e9 the Giant]] took place on ''[[The Main Event I]]'' in 1988 and was seen by 33 million people, the most-watched wrestling match in North American television history.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/Wrestlemania20/WrestleMania3.html|title=Steamboat&nbsp;\u2014 Savage rule WrestleMania 3|last=Powell|first=John|publisher=SLAM!

The steroid trial cost the company an estimated $5 million at a time of record low revenues. This helped drive many WWF wrestlers over to rival promotion [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW), including 1980s babyface hero Hulk Hogan. During this period, the WWF promoted wrestlers of a younger age comprising \"The New Generation\", featuring [[Shawn Michaels]], [[Kevin Nash|Diesel]], [[Scott Hall|Razor Ramon]], [[Bret Hart]], and [[The Undertaker]], in an effort to promote new talent into the spotlight.\n\nIn January 1993, the WWF debuted its flagship cable program ''[[WWE Raw|Monday Night Raw]]''. WCW countered in September 1995 with its own Monday night program, ''[[WCW Monday Nitro|Monday Nitro]]'', which aired in the same time slot as ''Raw''.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Shields|first1=Brian|last2=Sullivan|first2=Kevin|title=WWE: History of WrestleMania|year=2009|page=53}}</ref> The two programs would trade wins in the ensuing [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]] competition (known as the \"[[Monday Night Wars]]\") until mid-1996.

The younger McMahon bought Capitol from his father in 1982, effectively seizing control of the company. Seeking to make the WWF the premier wrestling promotion in the country, and eventually, the world, he began an expansion process that fundamentally changed the wrestling business.<ref name=si>{{cite news|first=William|last=Johnson|title=Wrestling With Success|work=[[Sports Illustrated]]|date=March 25, 1991|accessdate=April 20, 2014|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1119010/2/index.htm|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130918090310/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/vault/article/magazine/MAG1119010/2/index.htm|archivedate=September 18, 2013}}</ref>\n\nAt the annual meeting of the NWA in 1983, the McMahons and former Capitol employee [[Jim Barnett (wrestling)|Jim Barnett]] all withdrew from the organization.<ref name=won2011/> McMahon also worked to get WWF programming on syndicated television all across the United States. This angered other promoters and disrupted the well-established boundaries of the different wrestling promotions, eventually ending the territory system, which was in use since the founding of the NWA in the 1940s. In addition, the company used income generated by advertising, television deals, and tape sales to secure talent from rival promoters.\n\nIn an interview with ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'', McMahon noted: {{bquote|In the old days, there were wrestling fiefdoms all over the country, each with its own little lord in charge. Each little lord respected the rights of his neighboring little lord. No takeovers or raids were allowed. There were maybe 30 of these tiny kingdoms in the U.S. and if I hadn't bought out my dad, there would still be 30 of them, fragmented and struggling. I, of course, had no allegiance to those little lords.<ref name=si/>}}\n\nMcMahon gained significant traction when he hired [[American Wrestling Association]] (AWA) talent [[Hulk Hogan]], who had achieved popularity outside of wrestling, notably for his appearance in the film ''[[Rocky III]]''.<ref>{{IMDb title|0084602}}</ref> McMahon signed [[Roddy Piper]] as Hogan's rival, and then shortly afterward [[Jesse Ventura]] as an announcer. Other wrestlers joined the roster, such as [[Jimmy Snuka]], [[Don Muraco]], [[The Iron Sheik]], [[Nikolai Volkoff]], [[Junkyard Dog]], [[Paul Orndorff]], [[Greg Valentine]], and [[Ricky Steamboat]]. Many of the wrestlers who would later join the WWF were former AWA or NWA talent.\n\nThe WWF would tour nationally in a venture that would require a huge capital investment, one that placed the WWF on the verge of financial collapse. The future of McMahon's experiment came down to the success or failure of McMahon's groundbreaking concept, [[WrestleMania]]. WrestleMania was a major success and was (and still is) marketed as the [[Super Bowl]] of professional wrestling. The concept of a wrestling [[Card (sports)|supercard]] was nothing new in North America; the NWA had begun running [[Starrcade]] a few years prior. In McMahon's eyes, however, what separated WrestleMania from other supercards was that it was intended to be accessible to those who did not watch wrestling. He invited celebrities such as [[Mr. T]], [[Muhammad Ali]], and [[Cyndi Lauper]] to participate in the event, as well as securing a deal with [[MTV]] to provide coverage. The event and hype surrounding it led to the term ''[[Rock 'n' Wrestling Connection]]'', due to the cross-promotion of [[popular culture]] and professional wrestling.\n\nThe WWF business expanded significantly on the shoulders of McMahon and his [[face (professional wrestling)|babyface]] hero Hulk Hogan for the next several years. The introduction of ''[[Saturday Night's Main Event]]'' on [[NBC]] in 1985 marked the first time that professional wrestling had been broadcast on network television since the 1950s, when the now-defunct [[DuMont Television Network]] broadcast matches of Vince McMahon Sr.'s Capitol Wrestling Corporation. The 1980s \"Wrestling Boom\" peaked with the [[WrestleMania III]] pay-per-view at the Pontiac Silverdome in 1987, which set an attendance record of 93,173, a record that stood for 29 years until [[WrestleMania 32]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://uk.sports.yahoo.com/news/wrestlemania-32--record-and-reputations-tumble-075620564.html|title=Wrestlemania 32: Record and reputations tumble|publisher=|accessdate=March 15, 2017|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161007061259/https://uk.sports.yahoo.com/news/wrestlemania-32--record-and-reputations-tumble-075620564.html|archivedate=October 7, 2016}}</ref> A rematch of the WrestleMania III main event between WWF champion Hulk Hogan and [[Andr\u00e9 the Giant]] took place on ''[[The Main Event I]]'' in 1988 and was seen by 33 million people, the most-watched wrestling match in North American television history.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.ca/Slam/Wrestling/Wrestlemania20/WrestleMania3.html|title=Steamboat&nbsp;\u2014 Savage rule WrestleMania 3|last=Powell|first=John|publisher=SLAM!

The steroid trial cost the company an estimated $5 million at a time of record low revenues. This helped drive many WWF wrestlers over to rival promotion [[World Championship Wrestling]] (WCW), including 1980s babyface hero Hulk Hogan. During this period, the WWF promoted wrestlers of a younger age comprising \"The New Generation\", featuring [[Shawn Michaels]], [[Kevin Nash|Diesel]], [[Scott Hall|Razor Ramon]], [[Bret Hart]], and [[The Undertaker]], in an effort to promote new talent into the spotlight.\n\nIn January 1993, the WWF debuted its flagship cable program ''[[WWE Raw|Monday Night Raw]]''. WCW countered in September 1995 with its own Monday night program, ''[[WCW Monday Nitro|Monday Nitro]]'', which aired in the same time slot as ''Raw''.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Shields|first1=Brian|last2=Sullivan|first2=Kevin|title=WWE: History of WrestleMania|year=2009|page=53}}</ref> The two programs would trade wins in the ensuing [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]] competition (known as the \"[[Monday Night Wars]]\") until mid-1996.

WWE noted that their new company model was put into effect with the relaunch of ''[[WWE Tough Enough|Tough Enough]]'', being a non\u2013scripted program (contrary to the scripted nature of professional wrestling) and with the launch of the [[WWE Network]] (at the time scheduled to launch in 2012; later pushed back to 2014).

study published in 2019 previously revealed that [[Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus|SARS-CoV]], the strain of the virus that causes [[SARS]], was the most widely distributed coronavirus among a sample of [[Sunda pangolin]]s.<ref name=\"VirusesPangolins\" /> On 7 February 2020, it was announced that researchers from [[Guangzhou]] had discovered a [[pangolin]] sample with a viral

found evidence of [[reassortment]] in coronaviruses suggesting involvement of pangolins in the origin of SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"WongRecombination\" /> However, pangolin coronaviruses found to date only share at most 92% of their whole genomes with SARS-CoV-2, making them less similar than RaTG13 to SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"CurrentOrigin\" /> This is insufficient to prove pangolins to be the

It is a [[Positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus|positive-sense single-stranded RNA]] (+ssRNA) virus. Other coronaviruses are capable of causing illnesses ranging from the [[common cold]] to more severe diseases such as [[Middle East respiratory syndrome]] (MERS). It is the seventh known coronavirus to infect people, after [[Human coronavirus 229E|229E]], [[Human coronavirus NL63|NL63]], [[Human coronavirus OC43|OC43]], [[Human coronavirus HKU1|HKU1]], [[Middle East respiratory syndrome-related coronavirus|MERS-CoV]], and the original SARS-CoV.<ref name=\"NEJM-Novel\" />\n\nLike the SARS-related coronavirus strain implicated in the 2003 SARS outbreak, SARS-CoV-2 is a member of the subgenus ''[[Sarbecovirus]]'' ([[beta-CoV]] lineage B).<ref name=\"NextstrainPhylogeny\" /><ref name=\"Wong2019\" /> Its [[RNA]] sequence is approximately 30,000 [[nucleobase|base]]s in length.<ref name=\"gisaid\"/> SARS-CoV-2 is unique among known betacoronaviruses in its incorporation of a polybasic cleavage site, a characteristic known to increase [[pathogenicity]] and [[Basic reproduction number|transmissibility]] in other viruses.<ref name=\"Proximal\" /><ref name=\"CellWalls\" /><ref name=\"AntiviralCleavage\" />\n\nWith a sufficient number of sequenced [[genome]]s, it is possible to reconstruct a [[phylogenetic tree]] of the mutation history of a family of viruses.

facilitated rapid expansion of the infections.<ref name=\"early\" /><ref name=\"XivDecoding\" />\n\nResearch into the [[natural reservoir]] of the virus strain that caused the [[2002\u20132004 SARS

[[nucleic acid sequence]]s found in samples taken from ''[[Chinese rufous horseshoe bat|Rhinolophus sinicus]]'' show a resemblance of 80% to SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"MedVirEvolution\" /><ref name=\"NCBI-Bat\" /><ref name=\"NCBI-Bat2\" /> A third viral nucleic acid sequence from ''[[Intermediate horseshoe bat|Rhinolophus affinis]]'', collected in [[Yunnan|Yunnan province]] and designated

study published in 2019 previously revealed that [[Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus|SARS-CoV]], the strain of the virus that causes [[SARS]], was the most widely distributed coronavirus among a sample of [[Sunda pangolin]]s.<ref name=\"VirusesPangolins\" /> On 7 February 2020, it was announced that researchers from [[Guangzhou]] had discovered a [[pangolin]] sample with a viral nucleic acid sequence \"99% identical\" to SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"NaturePang\" /> When released, the results clarified that \"the receptor-binding domain of the S protein of the newly discovered Pangolin-CoV is virtually identical to that of 2019-nCoV, with one [[amino acid]] difference.\"<ref name=\"Isolation\" /> Pangolins are protected under Chinese law, but their [[pangolin trade|poaching

found evidence of [[reassortment]] in coronaviruses suggesting involvement of pangolins in the origin of SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"WongRecombination\" /> However, pangolin coronaviruses found to date only share at most 92% of their whole genomes with SARS-CoV-2, making them less similar than RaTG13 to SARS-CoV-2.<ref name=\"CurrentOrigin\" /> This is insufficient to prove pangolins to be the

An important difference is the lack of [[tomato]]es, which did not arrive in Europe until after [[Columbus's first voyage|Columbus reached America]] in 1492.
