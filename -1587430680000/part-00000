In historiography he is known mostly for his role in the 1899 conflict between the [[Archbishop|archbishops]] of [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] and [[Seville]]. Catapulted to nationwide notoriety, in the early 1900s he was a point of reference for heated debates on religion and politics; today he is considered a representative of intransigent religious fundamentalism. Roca served as lecturing [[Canon (priest)|canon]] by the cathedrals of [[Las Palmas]] (1876-1892) and Seville (1892-1917), animated some [[Diocese|diocesan]] periodicals, and published numerous booklets. He was one of very few nationally recognizable personalities of the Spanish Church who openly and systematically supported the [[Carlism|Carlist]] cause, though he remained sympathetic also towards the [[Integrism (Spain)|Integrist]] breed of [[Traditionalism (Spain)|Traditionalism]].\n\n==Family and youth==\n[[File:Pla\u00e7a de Vic en un dia de mercat (cropped).jpeg|left|thumb|[[Vic]]h, 19th c.]]\nThe ancient [[Catalan People|Catalan]] family of Roca became very branched throughout the centuries, with its representatives scattered across all of the region. It is not clear what particular line the ancestors of Roca y Ponsa followed; none of the sources consulted provides any information on his distant forefathers. It is established that his father, Cayetano Roca Subirachs (1828-1918),<ref> in some sources his segundo apellido is spelled as \"Subirat\", see e.g. ''La Gaceta de Tenerife'' 09.04.18, available [https://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.do?path=5046667&posicion=1&presentacion=pagina here].

The couple settled at Calle de la Riera.

In 1892 he was nominated [[:es:Penitenciario (presb\u00edtero)|canonigo penitenciario]],<ref> Roma 1933, p. 223</ref> and in 1893 he took over Canong\u00eda Magistral.<ref> Roma 1933, pp. 223-224</ref> His first years in [[Andalusia]] were uneventful, as in the mid-1890s he was noted merely for regular sermons.<ref>apart from the cathedral Roca preached also to various local institutions and organisations, e.g. in 1897 he was noted as speaking to Hermandad de Monserrate in Seville, ''ABC'' 26.03.94, available [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/sevilla/abc.sevilla/1994/03/26/111.html here]</ref> Things changed in 1899 when Roca gained nationwide recognition following publication of his pamphlet directed against teachings of the [[Primate of Spain|primate]], [[Ciriaco Mar\u00eda Sancha y Herv\u00e1s|cardinal Sancha]].<ref> in 1899 the archbishop of Toledo and the primate, cardenal Sancha, published an article which called the clergy and the Catholics to remain faithful and trust in the government of Sagasta. Roca responded with an anonymous booklet ''Observaciones que al capitulo XIII del op\u00fasculo del cardenal Sancha ha inspirado a un ciudadano espa\u00f1ol'', which claimed that the primate went off limits and that Catholics were free to follow their own political preferences, for details see e.g. Crist\u00f3bal Robles Mu\u00f1oz, ''Maura, un pol\u00edtico liberal'', Madrid 1995, {{ISBN|9788400074852}}, pp. 92-100</ref> Because it was wrongly assumed that the criticism was authorised by the [[Archbishop of Sevilla|Seville archbishop]] [[Marcelo Sp\u00ednola y Maestre|Sp\u00ednola]]<ref> since Roca\u2019s ''Observaciones'' was published with the official \u201clicencia ecclesi\u00e1stica\u201d, issued by the Seville archbishopry, Sancha assumed that Roca voiced on behalf of the Seville archbishop Marcelo Sp\u00ednola, who was probably either unaware or vaguely aware of the content of the booklet. Later Sancha and Sp\u00ednola got to know each other better, and in 1904, during coronation of V\u00edrgen de los Reyes, a great Seville feast engineered by Sp\u00ednola, it was Sancha who performed the act. This conciliatory gesture might be interpreted as some sort of apology on part of Sp\u00ednola, ''ABC'' 04.12.2004, available [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/sevilla/abc.sevilla/2004/12/04/018.html here]</ref> it caused a scandal and widespread debate.<ref>during the conflict, lasting for few months between 1899 and 1900, Roca\u2019s \u201cname reverberated across all Spain\u201d, ''ABC'' 04.05.43, available [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/sevilla/abc.sevilla/1943/05/04/006.html here]</ref> As a well-known personality he was then active in Catholic congresses staged in the early 1900s.

They were underpinned by confidence that a community without an officially accepted and enforced orthodoxy, a community where various concepts of public life constantly compete for domination, can not form an orderly, peaceful, operational society. In his view the only appropriate orthodoxy was Catholicism, which for centuries shaped the Spanish self and contributed to greatness of the nation; Catholic principles should serve as guidelines organizing both state and society. Their antithesis was [[liberalism]], not only useless as a political doctrine, but also unacceptable as a moral concept; it remained responsible for decline of Spain and would lead to further calamities in the future.<ref> Compare excerpts from ''Observaciones'': \u201cLos males que pesan sobre la Iglesia espa\u00f1ola proceden de nuestras Constituciones liberales.

In historiography he is known mostly for his role in the 1899 conflict between the [[Archbishop|archbishops]] of [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]] and [[Seville]]. Catapulted to nationwide notoriety, in the early 1900s he was a point of reference for heated debates on religion and politics; today he is considered a representative of intransigent religious fundamentalism. Roca served as lecturing [[Canon (priest)|canon]] by the cathedrals of [[Las Palmas]] (1876-1892) and Seville (1892-1917), animated some [[Diocese|diocesan]] periodicals, and published numerous booklets. He was one of very few nationally recognizable personalities of the Spanish Church who openly and systematically supported the [[Carlism|Carlist]] cause, though he remained sympathetic also towards the [[Integrism (Spain)|Integrist]] breed of [[Traditionalism (Spain)|Traditionalism]].\n\n==Family and youth==\n[[File:Pla\u00e7a de Vic en un dia de mercat (cropped).jpeg|left|thumb|[[Vic]]h, 19th c.]]\nThe ancient [[Catalan People|Catalan]] family of Roca became very branched throughout the centuries, with its representatives scattered across all of the region.

Later Sancha and Sp\u00ednola got to know each other better, and in 1904, during coronation of V\u00edrgen de los Reyes, a great Seville feast engineered by Sp\u00ednola, it was Sancha who performed the act. This conciliatory gesture might be interpreted as some sort of apology on part of Sp\u00ednola, ''ABC'' 04.12.2004, available [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/sevilla/abc.sevilla/2004/12/04/018.html here]</ref> it caused a scandal and widespread debate.<ref>during the conflict, lasting for few months between 1899 and 1900, Roca\u2019s \u201cname reverberated across all Spain\u201d, ''ABC'' 04.05.43, available [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/sevilla/abc.sevilla/1943/05/04/006.html here]</ref> As a well-known personality he was then active in Catholic congresses staged in the early 1900s.

They were underpinned by confidence that a community without an officially accepted and enforced orthodoxy, a community where various concepts of public life constantly compete for domination, can not form an orderly, peaceful, operational society. In his view the only appropriate orthodoxy was Catholicism, which for centuries shaped the Spanish self and contributed to greatness of the nation; Catholic principles should serve as guidelines organizing both state and society. Their antithesis was [[liberalism]], not only useless as a political doctrine, but also unacceptable as a moral concept; it remained responsible for decline of Spain and would lead to further calamities in the future.<ref> Compare excerpts from ''Observaciones'': \u201cLos males que pesan sobre la Iglesia espa\u00f1ola proceden de nuestras Constituciones liberales.

They prefer warm temperatures and can be more easily found from May to October in lower altitudes, and June to September in higher altitudes where the temperature is typically cooler.<ref name= ref1 /> In higher altitudes, female flies have shorter lifespans, are smaller, and lay fewer clutches of eggs.<ref name= ref1 /> They require fresh dung, primarily from cows and sheep, for reproduction.<ref name=ref15 /> They also eat [[nectarivory|nectar]] which is a source of sugar.<ref name=ref15 />\n\n===Altitude effects===\n''Sepsis cynipsea'' dung flies are often found in regions with varying altitudes, such as the [[Swiss Alps]].<ref name=ref10 /> Out of the many different [[Sepsidae]] species that are found in these regions, ''Sepsis cynipsea'' flies prefer intermediate altitudes but are found at all altitudes where other species of dung flies are found.<ref name=ref10 /> In the areas where these fly species are prevalent, there is more species diversity at higher altitudes.<ref name=ref10 /> Higher altitude environments tend to be more variable, so species found at higher altitudes have to be better at adapting to environmental changes.<ref name=ref10 /> However, ''S. cynpisea'' flies at different altitudes enter [[Diapause]] at the same time and stop producing eggs at the same time in the season.<ref name=ref14>Blanckenhorn, W.

Their growth rate also increases with warmer temperatures.<ref name=ref13 /> At {{cvt|30|C|F}}, it takes approximately 7 days for ''S. cynipsea'' flies to mature from eggs to adults.<ref name=ref15 /> Resource availability, which can vary based on environmental conditions and competition with other species, also has an impact on the size of an adult body.<ref name=ref15 /> ''S. cynipsea'' primarily uses temperature to determine when to enter [[Diapause]].<ref name=ref14 />\n\n===Competition===\nBecause [[Sepsidae]] flies are often found in the same regions, there can be competition between species, like from ''S. neocynipsea'' which also prefers fresh cow dung for reproduction. However, some fly species, like ''S. duplicata'' prefer dry and old cow dung; this is known as [[niche differentiation]].<ref name=ref10 />\n\n==Mating==\n===Reproduction===\n''Sepsis cynipsea'' flies are most known for their mating practices that involve [[sexual conflict]].

The eggs she is laying are fertilized from a previous mate.<ref name= ref8 /> After she lays her eggs on the fresh dung, she and the male move to the grass that surrounds the dung pile, where they have the opportunity to mate, although most pairs do not, as the female successfully shakes the male off.<ref name = ref8 /> If they do make genital contact and mate, the next eggs she lays will probably be his. When the eggs hatch and the larvae emerge, the larvae eat the dung and then leave.<ref name=ref13 /> ''S. cynipsea'' flies have evolved to develop quickly so they avoid competition with other coprophagous organisms and before the dung dries up.<ref name=ref13>Blanckenhorn, W.

The male reproductive organ is spiney, and females are left with scars and have a higher mortality after mating.<ref name=ref4 /> This genital organ is most likely so armored to make it hard for the females to shake the males off; the male has to spin 180 degrees to get his genital organ out of the female.<ref name= ref4 /> If a female does not shake the male off, they copulate. The flies then find another dung site 2\u20134 days later to repeat the process.<ref name= ref8 /> This results in approximately six generations to progress during each breeding season.<ref name=ref15 />\n\n==Evolution==\n===Sexual dimorphisms===\nIn the family [[Sepsidae]], there is clear [[sexual dimorphism]]. The male foreleg, for example, differs greatly from a female foreleg, and differs in between [[Sepsidae]] species, as well.<ref name=ref12>Puniamoorthy, N., Su, K., & Meier, R. (2008). Bending for love: losses and gains of sexual dimorphisms are strictly correlated with changes in the mounting position of sepsid flies (Sepsidae: Diptera). BMC Evolutionary Biology, 8(1), 155. https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2148-8-155</ref> The [[Morphology (biology)]] of the male foreleg evolved to aid the male in mounting the female and staying on her during her characteristic body shaking.<ref name=ref12 /> The male foreleg has evolved to have bristles, indentations, or bumps, which attach to the wing veins and cells on the female's wings.<ref name=ref12 /> In response to this, the female can bend her abdomen to prevent genital contact with the male.<ref name=ref12 /> In some [[Sepsidae]] species without adapted forelegs, the males have adapted an abdomen that bends to make contact with the female genitalia.<ref name=ref12 /> These sexually dimorphic characteristics can be very different between closely related species, so sexually dimorphic characteristics evolve quickly and are involved in speciation in the family [[Sepsidae]].\n\n===Taxonomy===\nThe family [[Sepsidae]] contains more than 320 species and 37 genera, which are globally widespread.<ref name=ref11>Zhao, L., Annie, A.

They look like ants, and often are difficult to identify without a microscope due to their appearance.<ref name=ref15 />\n\n==Distribution==\n[[File:Alps of Switzerland Cow above Sertig D\u00f6rfli (23024185119).jpg|thumb|Typical habitat of ''S. cynipsea'']]\n''Sepsis cynipsea'' dung flies are most commonly found in Europe. They prefer warm temperatures and can be more easily found from May to October in lower altitudes, and June to September in higher altitudes where the temperature is typically cooler.<ref name= ref1 /> In higher altitudes, female flies have shorter lifespans, are smaller, and lay fewer clutches of eggs.<ref name= ref1 /> They require fresh dung, primarily from cows and sheep, for reproduction.<ref name=ref15 /> They also eat [[nectarivory|nectar]] which is a source of sugar.<ref name=ref15 />\n\n===Altitude effects===\n''Sepsis cynipsea'' dung flies are often found in regions with varying altitudes, such as the [[Swiss Alps]].<ref name=ref10 /> Out of the many different [[Sepsidae]] species that are found in these regions, ''Sepsis cynipsea'' flies prefer intermediate altitudes but are found at all altitudes where other species of dung flies are found.<ref name=ref10 /> In the areas where these fly species are prevalent, there is more species diversity at higher altitudes.<ref name=ref10 /> Higher altitude environments tend to be more variable, so species found at higher altitudes have to be better at adapting to environmental changes.<ref name=ref10 /> However, ''S. cynpisea'' flies at different altitudes enter [[Diapause]] at the same time and stop producing eggs at the same time in the season.<ref name=ref14>Blanckenhorn, W. U.  (1998). Altitudinal differentiation in the [[diapause]] response of two species of dung flies. Ecological Entomology 23, 1-8.</ref>\n\n===Temperature effects===\nTemperature during the larval phase of development impacts growth rates and final body size of ''Sepsis cynipsea''.<ref name=ref13 /> ''S. cynipsea'' grow the best at intermediate temperatures compared to similar species.<ref name=ref13 /> However, in colder temperatures, ''S. cynipsea'' growth rates may increase so that they can reach adulthood before a cold season. Their growth rate also increases with warmer temperatures.<ref name=ref13 /> At {{cvt|30|C|F}}, it takes approximately 7 days for ''S. cynipsea'' flies to mature from eggs to adults.<ref name=ref15 /> Resource availability, which can vary based on environmental conditions and competition with other species, also has an impact on the size of an adult body.<ref name=ref15 /> ''S. cynipsea'' primarily uses temperature to determine when to enter [[Diapause]].<ref name=ref14 />\n\n===Competition===\nBecause [[Sepsidae]] flies are often found in the same regions, there can be competition between species, like from ''S. neocynipsea'' which also prefers fresh cow dung for reproduction. However, some fly species, like ''S. duplicata'' prefer dry and old cow dung; this is known as [[niche differentiation]].<ref name=ref10 />\n\n==Mating==\n===Reproduction===\n''Sepsis cynipsea'' flies are most known for their mating practices that involve [[sexual conflict]]. Their mating habits have been extensively studied to better understand sexual selection, female choice, and reluctance in mating.<ref name = ref1 /> ''Sepsis cynipsea'' flies require fresh dung to mate,<ref name= ref8>Teuschl, Y; Blanckenhorn, Wolf U (2007).

The females lay their eggs on the dung, and while they are laying their eggs, a male gets on top of the female and guards her.<ref name = ref2 /> Males are not selective for females; they tend to mount the first female they encounter on the dung.<ref name=ref12 /> However, this is not copulation. The eggs she is laying are fertilized from a previous mate.<ref name= ref8 /> After she lays her eggs on the fresh dung, she and the male move to the grass that surrounds the dung pile, where they have the opportunity to mate, although most pairs do not, as the female successfully shakes the male off.<ref name = ref8 /> If they do make genital contact and mate, the next eggs she lays will probably be his. When the eggs hatch and the larvae emerge, the larvae eat the dung and then leave.<ref name=ref13 /> ''S. cynipsea'' flies have evolved to develop quickly so they avoid competition with other coprophagous organisms and before the dung dries up.<ref name=ref13>Blanckenhorn, W. U. (1999). Different growth responses to temperature and resource limitation in three fly species with similar life histories. Evolutionary Ecology 13: 395-409</ref>\n\n===Sexual conflict===\nFemale ''Sepsis cynipsea'' flies are larger than the males, and because of this, a male cannot force a female to copulate with him.<ref name=ref2/> However, there is a lot of male competition.<ref name= ref3 /> There are usually far more males than females on a dung pile,<ref name= ref2 /> which leads to the ability for females to be selective.<ref name= ref8 /> If a female does not want to mate with a male, she begins to shake her body, which either indicates to males that she does not want to mate<ref name = ref2 /> or functions shake the male off of her body.<ref name = ref4>Wolf U. Blanckenhorn, David J. Hosken, Oliver Y. Martin, Constanze Reim, Yvonne Teuschl, Paul I. Ward, The costs of copulating in the dung fly Sepsis cynipsea, Behavioral Ecology, Volume 13, Issue 3, May 2002, Pages 353\u2013358, https://doi.org/10.1093/beheco/13.3.353</ref>\n\n=== Mate choice ===\nLarger males are more successful at mounting and mating with females, and larger females lay larger clutches of eggs.<ref name=ref15 /> In populations with greater mean body sizes, sexual selection is stronger compared to populations with smaller body sizes.<ref name=ref15 /> Once the male and female move into the grass after she lays her eggs, only about 40% of the pairs actually copulate.<ref name= ref8 /> And when they do, there is evidence to suggest that females get physically injured in the process. The male reproductive organ is spiney, and females are left with scars and have a higher mortality after mating.<ref name=ref4 /> This genital organ is most likely so armored to make it hard for the females to shake the males off; the male has to spin 180 degrees to get his genital organ out of the female.<ref name= ref4 /> If a female does not shake the male off, they copulate. The flies then find another dung site 2\u20134 days later to repeat the process.<ref name= ref8 /> This results in approximately six generations to progress during each breeding season.<ref name=ref15 />\n\n==Evolution==\n===Sexual dimorphisms===\nIn the family [[Sepsidae]], there is clear [[sexual dimorphism]]. The male foreleg, for example, differs greatly from a female foreleg, and differs in between [[Sepsidae]] species, as well.<ref name=ref12>Puniamoorthy, N., Su, K., & Meier, R. (2008). Bending for love: losses and gains of sexual dimorphisms are strictly correlated with changes in the mounting position of sepsid flies (Sepsidae: Diptera). BMC Evolutionary Biology, 8(1), 155. https://doi.org/10.1186/1471-2148-8-155</ref> The [[Morphology (biology)]] of the male foreleg evolved to aid the male in mounting the female and staying on her during her characteristic body shaking.<ref name=ref12 /> The male foreleg has evolved to have bristles, indentations, or bumps, which attach to the wing veins and cells on the female's wings.<ref name=ref12 /> In response to this, the female can bend her abdomen to prevent genital contact with the male.<ref name=ref12 /> In some [[Sepsidae]] species without adapted forelegs, the males have adapted an abdomen that bends to make contact with the female genitalia.<ref name=ref12 /> These sexually dimorphic characteristics can be very different between closely related species, so sexually dimorphic characteristics evolve quickly and are involved in speciation in the family [[Sepsidae]].\n\n===Taxonomy===\nThe family [[Sepsidae]] contains more than 320 species and 37 genera, which are globally widespread.<ref name=ref11>Zhao, L., Annie, A.
