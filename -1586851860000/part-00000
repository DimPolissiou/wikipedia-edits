It runs from the Oste near [[Spreckens]] four kilometres above [[Bremerv\u00f6rde]] through the former [[Teufelsmoor]] (\"Devil's Moor\") and [[Gnarrenburg]], until it reaches the Hamme near [[Viehspecken]].

Its long construction time was due to the difficulties caused by the soft peat soil which repeatedly collapsed and meant that the channel had to be re-excavated. From the 1860s numerous flap gates (''Klappstaue'') and double sluice gates were installed, that made it easier for the [[Torfschiffswerft Schlussdorf#Turf boats|peat barges, such as those built in the yard in Schlussdorf]].\n\n== Significance as a transport route ==\nThe canal initially formed the only inland water link between the [[Elbe]] and [[Weser]].

Acting on advice from Ohio's Department of Health director [[Amy Acton]], Governor [[Mike DeWine]] declared a state of emergency on March 9 when the state had only three confirmed cases and no deaths. Acton issued a [[stay-at-home order]] effective March 23.\n\nOhio's first cases were reported March 9, and the first death was reported on March 19. Later tests showed cases starting February 15 and the first death March 17. By April 12 Ohio had 6,518 confirmed cases of the virus, including 1,948 hospitalizations, 595 ICU admissions, and 253 deaths.\n\nOn March 27, Acton projected Ohio cases to peak in mid-May at 10,000 per day. By the first week in April, crediting Ohioan's compliance with social distancing requests, she had revised the projection to mid-to-late April or early May. On April 8, Acton said that the effectiveness of physical distancing being incorporated into modeling led to a revised projection of a new peak of 1,600 new cases per day in late April.\n\n==Spread of virus==\n[[File:Ohio coronavirus gif.gif|thumb|Coronavirus cases in Ohio from March 9, 2020 &ndash; April 4, 2020<br>\n{{legend|#e31a1a|>100 confirmed cases}}\n{{legend|#ee7070|10-99 confirmed cases}}\n{{legend|#ffC0C0|1\u20139 confirmed cases}}]]\n{{2019\u201320 coronavirus pandemic data/United States/Ohio medical cases chart}}\nOn March 9, Governor Mike DeWine reported Ohio's first 3 cases in [[Cuyahoga County, Ohio|Cuyahoga County]], a couple who had returned from a Nile River cruise, and a man who had returned from an annual conference in Washington, DC where other cases of coronavirus had been reported.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/politics/coronavirus-in-ohio-gov-dewine-announces-3-positive-cases/ar-BB10XdTF/|title=3 cases of coronavirus confirmed in Cuyahoga County; DeWine declares state of emergency|date=9 March 2020|access-date=9 March 2020}}</ref> Two days later, a fourth case, and the first instance of community spread, was confirmed by DeWine in [[Stark County, Ohio|Stark County]].<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=12 March 2020|title=First case of community spread coronavirus reported in Ohio|url=https://www.wlwt.com/article/first-case-of-community-spread-coronavirus-reported-in-ohio/31404482|date=12 March 2020|publisher=WLWT|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200312131050/https://www.wlwt.com/article/first-case-of-community-spread-coronavirus-reported-in-ohio/31404482|archive-date=12 March 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> Later tests showed the first case was February 15.<ref name=\"coronavirus.ohio.gov\">{{Cite web|url=https://coronavirus.ohio.gov/wps/portal/gov/covid-19/|title=Coronavirus|date=31 March 2020|website=coronavirus.ohio.gov|access-date=31 March 2020}}</ref>\n\nBy March 13, there were a total of 13 cases, with 159 others under observation.<ref>{{cite web|accessdate=19 March 2020|title=Coronavirus concerns in Northeast Ohio: Here are the latest updates for March 12, 2020|url=https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/coronavirus-concerns-in-northeast-ohio-here-are-the-latest-updates-for-march-12-2020/ar-BB116mDQ|publisher=msn|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200320141021/https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/us/coronavirus-concerns-in-northeast-ohio-here-are-the-latest-updates-for-march-12-2020/ar-BB116mDQ|archive-date=20 March 2020|url-status=live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=13 coronavirus cases now confirmed in Ohio, 159 under investigation|url=https://www.news5cleveland.com/news/continuing-coverage/coronavirus/13-coronavirus-cases-now-confirmed-in-ohio-159-under-investigation|website=News5Cleveland|first=Ian|last=Cross|date=13 March 2020|accessdate=13 March 2020|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200314151619/https://www.news5cleveland.com/news/continuing-coverage/coronavirus/13-coronavirus-cases-now-confirmed-in-ohio-159-under-investigation|archive-date=14 March 2020|url-status=live}}</ref> Within a week the first death was announced.

Noted for its resistance to being pulled apart ([[tensile strength]]), the dovetail joint is commonly used to join the sides of a drawer to the front.\nA series of 'pins' cut to extend from the end of one board interlock with a series of 'tails' cut into the end of another board. The pins and tails have a trapezoidal shape. Once glued, a wooden dovetail joint requires no mechanical fasteners.\n\nThe dovetail joint technique probably pre-dates written history. Some of the earliest known examples of the dovetail joint are in ancient Egyptian furniture entombed with mummies dating from First Dynasty, the tombs of Chinese emperors, and a stone pillar at the [[Vazhappally Maha Siva Temple]] in India. The dovetail design is an important method of distinguishing various periods of furniture.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\nIn Europe, the dovetail joint is sometimes called a '''swallowtail''' joint, a '''culvertail''' joint (''{{linktext|culver}}'' also means \u2018dove\u2019), or a '''fantail''' joint.<ref>{{cite book |date=1994 |title=Routledge French technical dictionary |url=http://www.routledge.com/books/details/9780203014257/ |volume=1 |location=London |publisher=[[Routledge]] |isbn=9780415112253 }}</ref>\n\n== Methods ==\nThe dovetail joint is very strong because of the way the 'tails' and 'pins' are shaped.  This makes it difficult to pull the joint apart and virtually impossible when glue is added.  This type of joint is used in box constructions such as drawers, jewellery boxes, cabinets and other pieces of furniture where strength is required.  It is a difficult joint to make manually, requiring skilled workmanship.  There are different types of dovetail joints.  \n\nThe angle of slope varies according to the wood used, purpose of joint and type of work. Typically the slope is 1:6 for [[softwood]]s, and a shallower 1:8 slope for [[hardwood]]s. Often a slope of 1:7 is used as a compromise. However, a different slope does not affect the strength of the joint in different types of wood.<ref>{{cite book |date=1958 |title=The relationship between dovetail angle and joint strength |url=http://www.akeda.com/documents/DovetailAngle.pdf}}</ref>\n\n==Types of dovetails==\n===Through dovetail===\n[[Image:joinery-throughdovetail.svg|thumb|200px|right|A through dovetail joint]]\nThe image at the top of this page shows a 'through dovetail' (also known as 'plain dovetail') joint, where the end grain of both boards is visible when the joint is assembled.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.woodworkdetails.com/knowledge/joints/case/dovetail |title=Dovetail Case Joints |website=Woodwork Details |access-date=February 6, 2015 }}</ref> Through dovetails are common in carcass and box construction. Traditionally, the dovetails would have often been covered by a veneer. However, dovetails have become a signature of craftsmanship and are generally considered a feature, so they are rarely concealed in contemporary work. When used in drawer construction, a through (or blind, [[Miter joint|mitred]], or lapped) dovetail joint is sometimes referred to as an \"English dovetail.\"<ref name=\"Furniche\">{{cite web|title=What's in Your Drawers|url=https://www.furniche.com/articles/whats-your-drawers|website=Furniche|accessdate=9 November 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Half-blind dovetail===\n[[Image:joinery-halfblinddovetail.gif|thumb|200px|right|A half-blind dovetail joint]]\nCraftsmen use a 'half-blind dovetail' when they do not want the end grain visible from the front of the joint. The tails fit into mortises in the ends of the board that is the front of the item, hiding their ends.\n\nHalf-blind dovetails are commonly used to fasten drawer fronts to drawer sides. This is an alternative to the practice of attaching false fronts to drawers constructed using through dovetails.\n\n===Secret mitred dovetail===\n[[Image:Secret Mitred Dovetail.png|thumb|200px|right|A secret [[Miter joint|mitred]] dovetail joint]]\nThe 'secret [[Miter joint|mitred]] dovetail' joint (also called a 'mitred blind dovetail', 'full-blind dovetail', or 'full-blind mitred dovetail') is used in the highest class of cabinet and box work. It offers the strength found in the dovetail joint but is totally hidden from both outside faces by forming the outer edge to meet at a 45-degree angle while hiding the dovetails internally within the joint.\n\nThe mitred corner dovetail joint is very similar in design, but it has just a single dovetail and is used for picture frames and other similar joins.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.toolstoday.com/g-46-dovetail-joints-different-types-and-their-uses.aspx |title=Dovetail Joints: Different Types and Their Uses |website=ToolsToday |access-date=February 6, 2015 }}</ref>\n\n===Secret double-lapped dovetail===\nThe '''secret double-lapped dovetail''' is similar to the secret mitred dovetail, but presents a very thin section of end grain on one edge of the joint. Used for carcass and box construction to hide the dovetails completely from view.\n\n===Sliding dovetail===\n[[Image:joinery-slidingdovetail.gif|thumb|200px|right|A sliding dovetail joint]]\nThe sliding dovetail is a method of joining two boards at right angles, where the intersection occurs within the field of one of the boards, that is not at the end. This joint provides the interlocking strength of a dovetail. Sliding dovetails are assembled by sliding the tail into the socket.  It is common to slightly taper the socket, making it slightly tighter towards the rear of the joint, so that the two components can be slid together easily but the joint becomes tighter as the finished position is reached.

Noted for its resistance to being pulled apart ([[tensile strength]]), the dovetail joint is commonly used to join the sides of a drawer to the front.\nA series of 'pins' cut to extend from the end of one board interlock with a series of 'tails' cut into the end of another board. The pins and tails have a trapezoidal shape. Once glued, a wooden dovetail joint requires no mechanical fasteners.\n\nThe dovetail joint technique probably pre-dates written history. Some of the earliest known examples of the dovetail joint are in ancient Egyptian furniture entombed with mummies dating from First Dynasty, the tombs of Chinese emperors, and a stone pillar at the [[Vazhappally Maha Siva Temple]] in India. The dovetail design is an important method of distinguishing various periods of furniture.{{citation needed|date=September 2019}}\n\nIn Europe, the dovetail joint is sometimes called a '''swallowtail''' joint, a '''culvertail''' joint (''{{linktext|culver}}'' also means \u2018dove\u2019), or a '''fantail''' joint.<ref>{{cite book |date=1994 |title=Routledge French technical dictionary |url=http://www.routledge.com/books/details/9780203014257/ |volume=1 |location=London |publisher=[[Routledge]] |isbn=9780415112253 }}</ref>\n\n== Methods ==\nThe dovetail joint is very strong because of the way the 'tails' and 'pins' are shaped.  This makes it difficult to pull the joint apart and virtually impossible when glue is added.  This type of joint is used in box constructions such as drawers, jewellery boxes, cabinets and other pieces of furniture where strength is required.  It is a difficult joint to make manually, requiring skilled workmanship.  There are different types of dovetail joints.  \n\nThe angle of slope varies according to the wood used, purpose of joint and type of work. Typically the slope is 1:6 for [[softwood]]s, and a shallower 1:8 slope for [[hardwood]]s. Often a slope of 1:7 is used as a compromise. However, a different slope does not affect the strength of the joint in different types of wood.<ref>{{cite book |date=1958 |title=The relationship between dovetail angle and joint strength |url=http://www.akeda.com/documents/DovetailAngle.pdf}}</ref>\n\n==Types of dovetails==\n===Through dovetail===\n[[Image:joinery-throughdovetail.svg|thumb|200px|right|A through dovetail joint]]\nThe image at the top of this page shows a 'through dovetail' (also known as 'plain dovetail') joint, where the end grain of both boards is visible when the joint is assembled.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.woodworkdetails.com/knowledge/joints/case/dovetail |title=Dovetail Case Joints |website=Woodwork Details |access-date=February 6, 2015 }}</ref> Through dovetails are common in carcass and box construction. Traditionally, the dovetails would have often been covered by a veneer. However, dovetails have become a signature of craftsmanship and are generally considered a feature, so they are rarely concealed in contemporary work. When used in drawer construction, a through (or blind, [[Miter joint|mitred]], or lapped) dovetail joint is sometimes referred to as an \"English dovetail.\"<ref name=\"Furniche\">{{cite web|title=What's in Your Drawers|url=https://www.furniche.com/articles/whats-your-drawers|website=Furniche|accessdate=9 November 2015}}</ref>\n\n===Half-blind dovetail===\n[[Image:joinery-halfblinddovetail.gif|thumb|200px|right|A half-blind dovetail joint]]\nCraftsmen use a 'half-blind dovetail' when they do not want the end grain visible from the front of the joint. The tails fit into mortises in the ends of the board that is the front of the item, hiding their ends.\n\nHalf-blind dovetails are commonly used to fasten drawer fronts to drawer sides. This is an alternative to the practice of attaching false fronts to drawers constructed using through dovetails.\n\n===Secret mitred dovetail===\n[[Image:Secret Mitred Dovetail.png|thumb|200px|right|A secret [[Miter joint|mitred]] dovetail joint]]\nThe 'secret [[Miter joint|mitred]] dovetail' joint (also called a 'mitred blind dovetail', 'full-blind dovetail', or 'full-blind mitred dovetail') is used in the highest class of cabinet and box work. It offers the strength found in the dovetail joint but is totally hidden from both outside faces by forming the outer edge to meet at a 45-degree angle while hiding the dovetails internally within the joint.\n\nThe mitred corner dovetail joint is very similar in design, but it has just a single dovetail and is used for picture frames and other similar joins.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.toolstoday.com/g-46-dovetail-joints-different-types-and-their-uses.aspx |title=Dovetail Joints: Different Types and Their Uses |website=ToolsToday |access-date=February 6, 2015 }}</ref>\n\n===Secret double-lapped dovetail===\nThe '''secret double-lapped dovetail''' is similar to the secret mitred dovetail, but presents a very thin section of end grain on one edge of the joint. Used for carcass and box construction to hide the dovetails completely from view.\n\n===Sliding dovetail===\n[[Image:joinery-slidingdovetail.gif|thumb|200px|right|A sliding dovetail joint]]\nThe sliding dovetail is a method of joining two boards at right angles, where the intersection occurs within the field of one of the boards, that is not at the end. This joint provides the interlocking strength of a dovetail. Sliding dovetails are assembled by sliding the tail into the socket.  It is common to slightly taper the socket, making it slightly tighter towards the rear of the joint, so that the two components can be slid together easily but the joint becomes tighter as the finished position is reached.  Another method to implement a tapered sliding dovetail is to taper the tail instead of the socket.  When used in drawer construction, a \"stopped sliding dovetail\" that does not extend across the full width of the board is sometimes referred to as a \"French dovetail\".<ref name=\"Furniche\" />\n\nUsed for:\n* Joining shelves to cabinet sides\n* Joining cabinet bottoms to sides\n* Joining horizontal partitions to shelves\n* Joining adjacent sections of expandable table frames\n* Joining drawer fronts to sides\n* Joining front rails of [[web frame]]s to cabinet sides\n* Joining neck and body in violins and some guitars.\n\n== Non-woodworking dovetails ==\n[[Image:Ironbridge2.jpg|thumb|[[Cast iron]] dovetail joints in the [[Iron Bridge]], Shropshire]]\nDovetails are most commonly, but not exclusively, used in woodworking.
