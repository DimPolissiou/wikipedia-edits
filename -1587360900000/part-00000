He can perform various feats of magic, such as self-duplication, [[teleportation]], shooting magical blasts, and changing the size of other creatures. In Japan, the character shares his name with his species, '''Kamek''' (which are known outside Japan as Magikoopas), which can lead to confusion surrounding his appearances. This will sometimes lead to a literal translation, as in ''Super Princess Peach'' where a boss is described as \"A Kamek made huge by magic.\" Some Japanese sources such as the guide for ''Super Mario Advance 3: Yoshi's Island'' call him \"Fang\" to distinguish him from regular Magikoopas.\n\n==Supporting characters==\n===Baby Luma/Lumas===\n{{nihongo foot|'''Baby Luma'''|\u30d9\u30d3\u30a3\u30c1\u30b3|Bebi Chiko|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is Mario's main companion in ''[[Super Mario Galaxy]]'' and its sequel ''[[Super Mario Galaxy 2]]''.

He helps Mario, Luigi, Wario, and Yoshi ride across water or reach higher areas. ''Super Mario Odyssey'' explicitly refers to Dorries as a species and it features two additional Dorries, one violet, and one yellow. In terms of design, Dorrie has a few elements in common with Yoshis, such as the white area of soft tissue spanning the whole lower part of the body and a similar round face that, since ''[[Super Mario 64 DS]]'', even features a placement of the eyes and nostrils akin to that seen in Yoshis.\n\nDorrie returns in ''[[New Super Mario Bros.]]'' and appears in two sizes.

U]]'', where he steals items from Toad Houses and the Mario Bros. have to chase him through various levels to capture him and get them back. He's the main source of P-Acorn powerups, making it worth the player's time to catch him. In ''New Super Luigi U'', he's promoted to Playable as the fourth character available for multiplayer. He returned to ''[[New Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe]]'' as a fifth playable character along with Toadette, Luigi, Toad and Mario.\n\nHe is a purple rabbit with round eyes, long ears, and black limbs.

While the original Pauline was portrayed as a [[blond]]e in a pink gown, this new version of the character was a [[Brown hair|brunette]] who wears a red dress.<ref name=\"ignpauline\" /> Because of her different design, the Pauline in the Game Boy version of ''Donkey Kong'' was initially considered in certain Mario media a separate character from the original incarnation of the character (who was still known as Lady) featured in the arcade and Famicom versions, with the two versions of the character being given separate profiles in Shogakukan's 1994 ''Mario Character Encyclopedia'' book.<ref name=lady_and_pauline>{{cite book|title=\u30d1\u30fc\u30d5\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u7248 \u30de\u30ea\u30aa\u30ad\u30e3\u30e9\u30af\u30bf\u30fc\u5927\u4e8b\u5178|trans-title=Mario Character Encyclopedia: Perfect Edition|publisher=Shogakukan|date=November 20, 1994|page=24|isbn=4092590679|url=http://i.imgur.com/3OabVR8.jpg}}</ref> However, later games and sources (most notably the Japanese version of ''[[Super Smash Bros. for Wii U and Nintendo 3DS]]'') acknowledge that Pauline and Lady are meant to be the same character.<ref name=pauline_trophy_jp>{{cite video game|title=\u5927\u4e71\u95d8\u30b9\u30de\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5\u30d6\u30e9\u30b6\u30fc\u30ba for Nintendo 3DS / Wii U|trans-title=Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS / Wii U|language=Japanese|quote=\u540d\u524d\u304c\u30ec\u30c7\u30a3? \u30dd\u30ea\u30fc\u30f3\u3058\u3083\u306a\u304f\u3066? \u306f\u3044\u3001\u30dd\u30ea\u30fc\u30f3\u3068\u3044\u3046\u540d\u306f\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30dc\u30fc\u30a4\u7248\u304b\u3089|trans-quote=Is her name Lady? or is it, Pauline?

In the game, it allows the playable characters to ride him through certain levels. Plessie's name is a portmanteau of \"[[Plesiosaurus]]\" and \"Nessie.\" The former is an extinct group of large marine reptiles that are often confused as dinosaurs, whereas the latter is the nickname given to the [[Loch Ness Monster]]. Its design share some features with the design of Yoshis, such as the bipedal posture with short legs, the white soft tissue that spans the lower part of the body, big oval eyes pointing forward which feature a white sclera, the nostrils being hosted near the top of a round protruding end of the upper part of the muzzle, and a crest on the back of the head, although the shape of the latter is different.\n\nPlessie appears in ''[[Super Smash Bros. Ultimate]]'' as a support spirit.\n\n===Poochy===\n{{nihongo foot|'''Poochy'''|\u30dd\u30c1|Pochi|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is [[Yoshi]]'s pet [[dog]]. Poochy doesn't have any ears or a nose, and he has big lips that look like a [[Duck|duck's]] bill, making him look more like a [[platypus]] than a dog. Poochy is a good swimmer and can sniff out hidden items for Yoshi. Poochy can also do things that Yoshi can't, such as crossing over dangerous terrain, and jumping over walls to give Yoshi a boost out of his wall jumps. Poochy's first appearance was in ''[[Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island]]''.\n\n===Professor E. Gadd===\n'''Professor Elvin Gadd''' ({{nihongo foot|'''Professor Oya M\u0101'''|\u30aa\u30e4\u30fb\u30de\u30fc\u535a\u58eb|Oya M\u0101 Hakase|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} in Japan), more commonly known as '''E. Gadd''', is a [[scientist]] who, with his various inventions, helps Luigi save his brother Mario and  the mansion. His name is a pun on the Japanese interjection '''{{nihongo foot|''Oyam\u0101!''|\u304a\u3084\u307e\u3042\uff01|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}}''', meaning \"Good heavens!\" His name is also inspired by [[Nintendo]] [[game designer]] Yoshiyuki Oyama.<ref>{{Cite journal |title=Inside Zelda |journal=[[Nintendo Power]] |date=March 2006 |volume=201 |pages=&nbsp;46\u201348}}</ref> The English translations accordingly adapted the name to a pun on the expression \"egad\"! His first appearance was in ''[[Luigi's Mansion]]'' for [[Nintendo GameCube]], in which he investigates a haunted mansion that mysteriously appeared by his laboratory. To help him study the ghosts in the mansion, he uses the \"Poltergust 3000\", a high-powered vacuum cleaner that can suck in and capture ghosts, and the \"[[Game Boy Color|Game Boy Horror]]\", an invention for tracking and detecting objects such as Boos. He lends it to Luigi and helps him on his quest. His voice is played by [[Kazumi Totaka]], who also voiced [[Yoshi]].\n\nGadd reprises his supporting role in ''[[Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon]]'' in a remodeled lab to assist Luigi again with his \"Poltergust 5000\" and a \"[[Nintendo DS|Dual Scream]]\", which replaces the Game Boy Horror. The Nintendo 3DS remake of the original ''Luigi\u2019s Mansion'' introduces a new invention: a lime-green doppelg\u00e4nger of Luigi, called \"Gooigi\", which can be brought along as a partner in local co-op play.\n\nIn the third installment, ''[[Luigi's Mansion 3]]'', Gooigi returns and E. Gadd provides Luigi with a new Poltergust model, the \"Poltergust G-00\". Luigi rescues him at the time when his friends were captured by Hellen Gravely at a hotel called The Last Resort.\n\nHe is mentioned in ''[[Super Mario Sunshine]]'' but not seen, but his inventions: a '''Flash Liquidizer Ultra Dousing Device''' or \"'''F.L.U.D.D.'''\" and Magic Brush were used by Mario and [[Bowser Jr.]] respectively. E. Gadd also creates a Time Machine in ''[[Mario & Luigi: Partners in Time]]'' and various inventions as rewards for making bean coffees at the Starbeans Cafe in ''[[Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga]]'' and its [[Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga + Bowser's Minions|3DS remake]]. In ''[[Mario Party 6]]'', E. Gadd is featured on a party board called E. Gadd's Garage.\n\n''[[Super Mario Maker]]'' features E. Gadd as an unlockable ''Mystery Mushroom'' costume, made available through an update.\n\n===Sprixie Princesses===\nThe {{nihongo foot|'''Sprixie Princesses'''|\u3088\u3046\u305b\u3044\u59eb|Y\u014dseihime|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} are the rulers of the Sprixie Kingdom and the Sprixies, a race of [[Fairy|fairies]]. They appear in ''[[Super Mario 3D World]]''. The green Sprixie Princess is the sole Sprixie Princess and refers to the others as her followers. The green Sprixie Princess first appears when Mario and Luigi find and repair a Clear Pipe. The pipe promptly ejects a large number of items before the princess emerges. The green Sprixie Princess tells the group that the Sprixie Kingdom is in danger, as Bowser had managed to capture the other six princesses and that she had only narrowly escaped his grasp. Moments after she emerges, however, Bowser comes up through the same pipe, leaving her dazed, captures the green Sprixie Princess in a bottle, and retreats down the pipe. The group quickly follows after Bowser in order to rescue the kingdom, and they soon find that each Sprixie Princess is guarded in one of the first seven worlds' castles. Defeating the boss of the castle will reveal a Warp Box that takes the group to a room containing both the Goal Pole and the imprisoned Sprixie.\n\nEach time a Sprixie Princess is saved, she will build a Clear Pipe to the next world with either a hammer or a wrench (with the exception of the red Sprixie Princess, since she was recaptured after she was saved in World Castle (World 7) and she only helped build a rocket ship). It is possible for the player to skip saving the first and fourth Sprixie Princesses if they take the secret exits found in World 1 and World 4, respectively, although as a result they will be entirely absent during the ending and when Bowser recaptures them.\n\nThe group eventually manages to rescue the last of the seven Sprixie Princesses after defeating Bowser in his car for the second time in World Castle (World 7), seemingly the last stage of the game. However, Bowser promptly reappears, stuffs all seven princesses into a larger bottle, and flees to World Bowser (World 8), a Bowser-themed carnival area that serves as the true final world of the main game. Here, Bowser confronts the heroes after transforming into Meowser and is defeated, dropping the Sprixie Princesses in the process. The princesses then use their powers to undo all the harm done to their land before waving goodbye to the heroes as they return to the Mushroom Kingdom via a Clear Pipe.\n\nAfter the ending credits, the Sprixie Princesses build a rocket ship in World 1 for the player to use in order to travel to the secret bonus worlds in outer space (Star, Mushroom, Flower, and Crown).\n\nThe green Sprixie Princess is also playable in ''[[Mario Tennis: Ultra Smash]]''.\n\n===Tiara===\n{{nihongo foot|'''Tiara'''|\u30c6\u30a3\u30a2\u30e9|Tiara|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is the secondary damsel in distress in ''[[Super Mario Odyssey]]''. She is the sister of Cappy, who is kidnapped by [[Bowser (character)|Bowser]] as a gift to [[Princess Peach]] to wear on their wedding day.\n\n===Toad Brigade===\nThe {{nihongo foot|'''Toad Brigade'''|\u30ad\u30ce\u30d4\u30aa\u63a2\u691c\u968a|Kinopio Tankentai|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is a group of five Toads that aid Mario through some games, starting with ''[[Super Mario Galaxy]]''. They are led by Captain Toad. Later the group would expand to include Toadette, bringing the membership up to six. The members consist of Captain Toad, Toadette, Hint Toad (blue), Yellow Toad, Banktoad (green), and Mailtoad (magenta).\n\n===Toadsworth===\n{{nihongo foot|'''Toadsworth'''|\u30ad\u30ce\u3058\u3044|Kinojii|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is an elderly Toad and Princess Peach's longtime [[Steward (office)|steward]], first appearing in ''[[Super Mario Sunshine]]'', when he comes along with Princess Peach and Mario to Isle Delfino. He makes a brief appearance in ''[[Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga]]'' at the beginning (where he presents Mario and Luigi with a suitcase) and end of the game.\n\nPaper Toadsworth accompanies Paper Princess Peach on her trip to Rogueport during ''[[Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door]]'', keeping Paper Peach very close to him, but ends up losing her.\n\nIn ''[[Mario & Luigi: Partners in Time]]'', he is with Mario and Luigi when Princess Peach takes an experimental trip back in time. He is also included in ''[[Super Princess Peach]]'' where he gives Peach a parasol named Perry in the cinema and is seen as a lead guitarist of the band called Peach Hit Five in the music room.\n\nHe also appears in ''[[Mario & Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story]]'' and its 3DS remake where he was inhaled by Bowser. In ''[[Mario & Luigi: Dream Team]]'', Toadsworth appeared as the gang went on a vacation in Pi'illo Island.\n\nToadsworth makes a brief appearance in ''[[Mario Kart: Double Dash]]'' when the player wins a cup. He acts as an umpire in ''[[Mario Power Tennis]]'' for the [[GameCube]] as well as in the [[remake]] for the [[Wii]], in which Toadsworth reprimands the player when a foul shot is made. In ''[[Mario Party 7]]'', he is a host of the boards. He finally becomes playable in both ''[[Mario Superstar Baseball]]'' and ''[[Mario Super Sluggers]]''.\n\nToadsworth is voiced by [[Charles Martinet]], who also voices [[Mario]], [[Luigi]], [[Wario]] and [[Waluigi]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Fenech |first=Stephen |url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/entertainment/meet-the-voice-of-super-mario-charles-martinet/story-e6frewyr-1225772856617 |title=Meet the voice of Super Mario Charles Martinet |publisher=Dailytelegraph.com.au |date=2009-09-14 |accessdate=2010-08-05}}</ref> N-Philes criticized Toadsworth's voice in ''[[Super Mario Sunshine]]'', calling it \"laughable\", \"comical\", and \"utterly pessimistic\".<ref>{{cite web |author=Gareth Trinkwon |url=http://www.n-philes.com/reviews/63/super-mario-sunshine/ |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120903145402/http://www.n-philes.com/reviews/63/super-mario-sunshine/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-09-03 |title=News :: Super Mario Sunshine |publisher=N-Philes |accessdate=2010-04-08 }}</ref>\n\n==Supporting antagonists==\n===Boom Boom===\n{{nihongo foot|'''Boom Boom'''|\u30d6\u30f3\u30d6\u30f3|Bunbun|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is the henchman and faithful servant of Bowser. He first appeared in ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]'' as one of the main antagonists of the game, where he often fights with Mario or Luigi by chasing him flailing his arms, jumping high and flying at them. Boom Boom returned in ''[[Super Mario 3D Land]]'' 23 years after their last appearance. He resides in various airships where he encounters Mario. In ''[[New Super Mario Bros. U]]'', he reprises his old role from ''Super Mario Bros. 3'', guarding the fortresses and towers.\n\nIn four episodes of ''[[The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3]]'', Boom Boom appears as a silent powerhouse who often cause troubles to Mario and Luigi.\n\n===Broodals===\nThe {{nihongo foot|'''Broodals'''|\u30d6\u30eb\u30fc\u30c0\u30eb\u30ba|Bur\u016bdaruzu|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} are a group of villainous anthropomorphic [[rabbit]]s who double as wedding planners in ''[[Super Mario Odyssey]]''. Their boss is Madame Broode. They were hired by Bowser in order to stop Mario from reaching him. The members consist of Topper, Hariet, Rango and Spewart.\n\n===Draggadon===\n{{nihongo foot|'''Draggadons'''|\u30c9\u30e9\u30b4\u30c9\u30f3|Doragodon|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} are [[dragon]]s first appearing in the game ''[[Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker]]''. Although in said game only Draggadon, the king of an isolated volcano called Pyropuff Peak, and Gold Draggadon, the king of the Golden Realm.\n\nThe first, named Draggadon, is fought in Episode 1-10: The King of Pyropuff Peak, Episode 2-9: Draggadon's Revenge, and Bonus Episode-11: Mummy-Me at Pyropuff Peak. When Captain Toad is chasing Wingo who kidnapped Toadette, he accidentally comes across Pyropuff Peak. Draggadon attacks him, thinking him to be an intruder, but after the fight realizes that he was innocent, and allows him to ride on his head as the two conquer hordes of enemies. Toadette in her pursuit of Wingo also ends up at Pyropuff Peak, which results in the same situation playing. Once again, Toadette befriends him, and they conquer even more enemies.\n\nUnlike Wingo, Draggadon is not battled directly. Captain Toad and Toadette must avoid his attacks to the end of the level by hiding behind walls, and at the end, knock a pillar on his head. He is then knocked unconscious, and the Toads collect the Power Star. Another Draggadon, named Gold Draggadon, also appears in a later episode, as the king of the Golden Realm. Like Draggadon, Captain Toad must also fight Gold Draggadon as boss, although fireballs will move faster and the lava will rise quicker, and after defeating him, he lets Captain Toad ride him.\n\n===Dry Bowser===\n{{nihongo foot|'''Dry Bowser'''|\u307b\u306d\u30af\u30c3\u30d1|Hone Kuppa|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is a recurring antagonist in the ''Mario'' series. Debuting as a form of Bowser after losing his flesh in ''[[New Super Mario Bros.]]'', the character has appeared as his own being starting with ''[[Mario Kart Wii]]'', often serving as the final antagonist in the main games.

Dry Bowser is a playable character in several of the Mario spin-off games.\n\n===Fawful===\n{{Main|Fawful}}\n\n'''{{nihongo foot|Fawful|\u30b2\u30e9\u30b3\u30d3\u30c3\u30c4|Gerakobittsu|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}}''', is a recurring antagonist in the ''[[Mario & Luigi]]'' series.

After being defeated by the Star Kid, Twink, she continued to work for him. In ''[[Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door]]'', she acted as Bowser's second-in-command. Generally, her position is very similar with Kamek who appeared earlier than her, which possibly means why she is replaced by him in ''[[Paper Mario: Sticker Star]]''. [[IGN]] rated her as one of the weirdest ''Mario'' characters.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://au.wii.ign.com/articles/119/1199242p3.html|title=Weirdest Mario Characters|first=Audrey|last=Drake|accessdate=18 September 2016|publisher=IGN}}</ref>\n\n===King Bob-omb===\n{{nihongo foot|'''King Bob-omb'''|\u30dc\u30e0\u30ad\u30f3\u30b0|Bomu Kingu|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is the king of the Bob-ombs.

This will sometimes lead to a literal translation, as in ''Super Princess Peach'' where a boss is described as \"A Kamek made huge by magic.\" Some Japanese sources such as the guide for ''Super Mario Advance 3: Yoshi's Island'' call him \"Fang\" to distinguish him from regular Magikoopas.\n\n==Supporting characters==\n===Baby Luma/Lumas===\n{{nihongo foot|'''Baby Luma'''|\u30d9\u30d3\u30a3\u30c1\u30b3|Bebi Chiko|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is Mario's main companion in ''[[Super Mario Galaxy]]'' and its sequel ''[[Super Mario Galaxy 2]]''. He is among a group of star-shaped beings known as Lumas, who appear in both games.\n\nIn ''Super Mario Galaxy'' Baby Luma first finds Mario sleeping in the planet that houses the ''Gateway to the Starry Sky'' after he has been blasted out of the ''Mushroom World'', and joins him at the request of [[Rosalina (Mario)|Rosalina]], aiding him in his quest to rescue [[Princess Peach]] from [[Bowser (character)|Bowser]] by allowing him to use the \"Spin\" move, which he can use to break crystals, attack enemies and further his jumps, among other things. In the ending of the game, Baby Luma sacrifices his life along his brethren to save the universe from a [[black hole]].\n\nIn ''Super Mario Galaxy 2'', Baby Luma is found by Mario while he was on his way to Princess Peach's Castle and they join forces to rescue the town from a new attack by Bowser, only to be sent out in a new adventure. In this game Baby Luma often receives messages from Rosalina, who remains anonymous for most of the game. He is also called Young Master Luma by other Lumas.\n\n===Cappy===\n{{nihongo foot|'''Cappy'''|\u30ad\u30e3\u30c3\u30d4\u30fc|Kyapp\u012b|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is the secondary protagonist in ''[[Super Mario Odyssey]]''. Cappy is a Bonneter who meets Mario in the Cap Kingdom, when he pleas for Mario to assist him in rescuing his little sister Tiara. Cappy has the ability to possess enemies and other creatures, allowing Mario to take control of them for periods of time.\n\nCappy appears in ''[[Super Smash Bros. Ultimate]]'' as [[Mario]]'s side taunt and a Spirit. He quickly throws Cappy and returns it to his head similar to in ''[[Super Mario Odyssey]]''.\n\n===Captain Toad===\n{{nihongo foot|'''Captain Toad'''|\u30ad\u30ce\u30d4\u30aa\u968a\u9577|Kinopio Taich\u014d|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is an explorer and the leader of the Toad Brigade. He appears in various games including ''Super Mario Galaxy'' and ''[[Super Mario 3D World]]'', and later appears as the protagonist in the game ''[[Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker]]''. When he appears in ''Super Mario Galaxy'', he is seen building the Starshroom in the Comet Observatory progressively throughout the game. He also makes an appearance as a non-playable character in ''Super Mario Odyssey'' lost in each kingdom.<ref>https://www.nintendo.com/games/detail/captain-toad-treasure-tracker-switch Retrieved July 19, 2018</ref>\n\n===Dorrie===\n{{nihongo foot|'''Dorrie'''|\u30c9\u30c3\u30b7\u30fc|Dossh\u012b|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is a large, friendly swimming blue [[Plesiosauria|plesiosaur]]-like character who debuted in ''[[Super Mario 64]]''. He helps Mario, Luigi, Wario, and Yoshi ride across water or reach higher areas. ''Super Mario Odyssey'' explicitly refers to Dorries as a species and it features two additional Dorries, one violet, and one yellow. In terms of design, Dorrie has a few elements in common with Yoshis, such as the white area of soft tissue spanning the whole lower part of the body and a similar round face that, since ''[[Super Mario 64 DS]]'', even features a placement of the eyes and nostrils akin to that seen in Yoshis.\n\nDorrie returns in ''[[New Super Mario Bros.]]'' and appears in two sizes. Mario can ride on his back to cross large bodies of poison in World 4-1 and World 4-6. If Mario does a Ground Pound on Dorrie, he moves faster through the water.\n\n===Honey Queen===\n{{nihongo foot|'''Honey Queen'''|\u30cf\u30cb\u30fc\u30af\u30a4\u30fc\u30f3|Han\u012b Ku\u012bn|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is the queen of all the [[Honey bee|Honeybees]].

Ultimate]]'' as a spirit.\n\n===Nabbit===\n{{nihongo foot|'''Nabbit'''|\u30c8\u30c3\u30c6\u30f3|Totten|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is a [[rabbit]]-like [[thief]] who first appears in ''[[New Super Mario Bros. U]]'', where he steals items from Toad Houses and the Mario Bros. have to chase him through various levels to capture him and get them back. He's the main source of P-Acorn powerups, making it worth the player's time to catch him. In ''New Super Luigi U'', he's promoted to Playable as the fourth character available for multiplayer. He returned to ''[[New Super Mario Bros. U Deluxe]]'' as a fifth playable character along with Toadette, Luigi, Toad and Mario.\n\nHe is a purple rabbit with round eyes, long ears, and black limbs. He also wears a white handkerchief with a drawing of a large mouth with sharpened teeth, similar to Bowser Jr.'s mask (though despite this he does not work for Bowser), as well as orange shoes and white gloves.\n\nNabbit also appeared as a stage hazard in ''[[Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS / Wii U]]'' and ''[[Super Smash Bros. Ultimate]]'' in the Mushroom Kingdom U stage.\n\n===Pauline===\n{{nihongo foot|'''Pauline'''|\u30dd\u30ea\u30fc\u30f3|Por\u012bn|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is the [[damsel in distress]] from the original ''[[Donkey Kong (video game)|Donkey Kong]]'',<ref name=\"ignDK\">{{cite web| title = Donkey Kong| publisher = IGN| url = http://cheats.ign.com/objects/017/017317.html| accessdate = 2010-07-06}}</ref> as well as the [[Donkey Kong (Game Boy)|1994 Game Boy game of the same name]].<ref>{{cite web| title = Donkey Kong| publisher = IGN| url = http://gameboy.ign.com/objects/010/010293.html| accessdate = 2010-07-06}}</ref> She also appeared in ''[[Mario vs. Donkey Kong 2: March of the Minis]]'' and ''[[Mario vs. Donkey Kong: Minis March Again!]]''.

The name Pauline was first given to the character in the ''Donkey Kong'' animated segments shown in the television series ''[[Saturday Supercade]]'' voiced by [[Judy Strangis]]. Then she was used for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System|NES]] version of the game, although print ads for the [[Game & Watch]] version of the game referred to her as '''Louise'''.<ref name=gw_louise>{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2007/09/16/promotional-consideration-multi-screen/|title=Promotional Consideration: Multi Screen|website=EndGadget|author=Eric Caoili|date=September 16, 2007}}</ref> After ''Donkey Kong'', Pauline made cameo appearances in two other NES games, ''[[Pinball (video game)|Pinball]]'' and ''[[Famicom BASIC]]''.<ref name=\"ignpauline\" /> [[Princess Peach]], introduced in ''[[Super Mario Bros.]]'', supplanted Pauline's original role as damsel in distress in the ''Mario'' games.\n\nIn the 1994 Game Boy version of ''Donkey Kong'', Pauline was given a radically different design. While the original Pauline was portrayed as a [[blond]]e in a pink gown, this new version of the character was a [[Brown hair|brunette]] who wears a red dress.<ref name=\"ignpauline\" /> Because of her different design, the Pauline in the Game Boy version of ''Donkey Kong'' was initially considered in certain Mario media a separate character from the original incarnation of the character (who was still known as Lady) featured in the arcade and Famicom versions, with the two versions of the character being given separate profiles in Shogakukan's 1994 ''Mario Character Encyclopedia'' book.<ref name=lady_and_pauline>{{cite book|title=\u30d1\u30fc\u30d5\u30a7\u30af\u30c8\u7248 \u30de\u30ea\u30aa\u30ad\u30e3\u30e9\u30af\u30bf\u30fc\u5927\u4e8b\u5178|trans-title=Mario Character Encyclopedia: Perfect Edition|publisher=Shogakukan|date=November 20, 1994|page=24|isbn=4092590679|url=http://i.imgur.com/3OabVR8.jpg}}</ref> However, later games and sources (most notably the Japanese version of ''[[Super Smash Bros. for Wii U and Nintendo 3DS]]'') acknowledge that Pauline and Lady are meant to be the same character.<ref name=pauline_trophy_jp>{{cite video game|title=\u5927\u4e71\u95d8\u30b9\u30de\u30c3\u30b7\u30e5\u30d6\u30e9\u30b6\u30fc\u30ba for Nintendo 3DS / Wii U|trans-title=Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS / Wii U|language=Japanese|quote=\u540d\u524d\u304c\u30ec\u30c7\u30a3? \u30dd\u30ea\u30fc\u30f3\u3058\u3083\u306a\u304f\u3066? \u306f\u3044\u3001\u30dd\u30ea\u30fc\u30f3\u3068\u3044\u3046\u540d\u306f\u30b2\u30fc\u30e0\u30dc\u30fc\u30a4\u7248\u304b\u3089|trans-quote=Is her name Lady? or is it, Pauline?

She is a guest VIP at the grand opening of the \"Super Mini Mario World\", a theme park based on Mini-Mario toys, where she is kidnapped by Donkey Kong. She also appears in ''[[Mario vs. Donkey Kong: Minis March Again!]]'' for the DSiWare, and ''[[Mario vs. Donkey Kong: Mini-Land Mayhem]]'' for the DS, where she is once again kidnapped by Donkey Kong.\n\nPauline returns in ''[[Super Mario Odyssey]]'' on the [[Nintendo Switch]] voiced by [[Kate Higgins]].

In the game, it allows the playable characters to ride him through certain levels. Plessie's name is a portmanteau of \"[[Plesiosaurus]]\" and \"Nessie.\" The former is an extinct group of large marine reptiles that are often confused as dinosaurs, whereas the latter is the nickname given to the [[Loch Ness Monster]]. Its design share some features with the design of Yoshis, such as the bipedal posture with short legs, the white soft tissue that spans the lower part of the body, big oval eyes pointing forward which feature a white sclera, the nostrils being hosted near the top of a round protruding end of the upper part of the muzzle, and a crest on the back of the head, although the shape of the latter is different.\n\nPlessie appears in ''[[Super Smash Bros. Ultimate]]'' as a support spirit.\n\n===Poochy===\n{{nihongo foot|'''Poochy'''|\u30dd\u30c1|Pochi|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is [[Yoshi]]'s pet [[dog]]. Poochy doesn't have any ears or a nose, and he has big lips that look like a [[Duck|duck's]] bill, making him look more like a [[platypus]] than a dog. Poochy is a good swimmer and can sniff out hidden items for Yoshi. Poochy can also do things that Yoshi can't, such as crossing over dangerous terrain, and jumping over walls to give Yoshi a boost out of his wall jumps. Poochy's first appearance was in ''[[Super Mario World 2: Yoshi's Island]]''.\n\n===Professor E. Gadd===\n'''Professor Elvin Gadd''' ({{nihongo foot|'''Professor Oya M\u0101'''|\u30aa\u30e4\u30fb\u30de\u30fc\u535a\u58eb|Oya M\u0101 Hakase|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} in Japan), more commonly known as '''E. Gadd''', is a [[scientist]] who, with his various inventions, helps Luigi save his brother Mario and  the mansion. His name is a pun on the Japanese interjection '''{{nihongo foot|''Oyam\u0101!''|\u304a\u3084\u307e\u3042\uff01|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}}''', meaning \"Good heavens!\" His name is also inspired by [[Nintendo]] [[game designer]] Yoshiyuki Oyama.<ref>{{Cite journal |title=Inside Zelda |journal=[[Nintendo Power]] |date=March 2006 |volume=201 |pages=&nbsp;46\u201348}}</ref> The English translations accordingly adapted the name to a pun on the expression \"egad\"! His first appearance was in ''[[Luigi's Mansion]]'' for [[Nintendo GameCube]], in which he investigates a haunted mansion that mysteriously appeared by his laboratory. To help him study the ghosts in the mansion, he uses the \"Poltergust 3000\", a high-powered vacuum cleaner that can suck in and capture ghosts, and the \"[[Game Boy Color|Game Boy Horror]]\", an invention for tracking and detecting objects such as Boos. He lends it to Luigi and helps him on his quest. His voice is played by [[Kazumi Totaka]], who also voiced [[Yoshi]].\n\nGadd reprises his supporting role in ''[[Luigi's Mansion: Dark Moon]]'' in a remodeled lab to assist Luigi again with his \"Poltergust 5000\" and a \"[[Nintendo DS|Dual Scream]]\", which replaces the Game Boy Horror. The Nintendo 3DS remake of the original ''Luigi\u2019s Mansion'' introduces a new invention: a lime-green doppelg\u00e4nger of Luigi, called \"Gooigi\", which can be brought along as a partner in local co-op play.\n\nIn the third installment, ''[[Luigi's Mansion 3]]'', Gooigi returns and E. Gadd provides Luigi with a new Poltergust model, the \"Poltergust G-00\". Luigi rescues him at the time when his friends were captured by Hellen Gravely at a hotel called The Last Resort.\n\nHe is mentioned in ''[[Super Mario Sunshine]]'' but not seen, but his inventions: a '''Flash Liquidizer Ultra Dousing Device''' or \"'''F.L.U.D.D.'''\" and Magic Brush were used by Mario and [[Bowser Jr.]] respectively. E. Gadd also creates a Time Machine in ''[[Mario & Luigi: Partners in Time]]'' and various inventions as rewards for making bean coffees at the Starbeans Cafe in ''[[Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga]]'' and its [[Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga + Bowser's Minions|3DS remake]]. In ''[[Mario Party 6]]'', E. Gadd is featured on a party board called E. Gadd's Garage.\n\n''[[Super Mario Maker]]'' features E. Gadd as an unlockable ''Mystery Mushroom'' costume, made available through an update.\n\n===Sprixie Princesses===\nThe {{nihongo foot|'''Sprixie Princesses'''|\u3088\u3046\u305b\u3044\u59eb|Y\u014dseihime|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} are the rulers of the Sprixie Kingdom and the Sprixies, a race of [[Fairy|fairies]]. They appear in ''[[Super Mario 3D World]]''. The green Sprixie Princess is the sole Sprixie Princess and refers to the others as her followers. The green Sprixie Princess first appears when Mario and Luigi find and repair a Clear Pipe. The pipe promptly ejects a large number of items before the princess emerges. The green Sprixie Princess tells the group that the Sprixie Kingdom is in danger, as Bowser had managed to capture the other six princesses and that she had only narrowly escaped his grasp. Moments after she emerges, however, Bowser comes up through the same pipe, leaving her dazed, captures the green Sprixie Princess in a bottle, and retreats down the pipe. The group quickly follows after Bowser in order to rescue the kingdom, and they soon find that each Sprixie Princess is guarded in one of the first seven worlds' castles. Defeating the boss of the castle will reveal a Warp Box that takes the group to a room containing both the Goal Pole and the imprisoned Sprixie.\n\nEach time a Sprixie Princess is saved, she will build a Clear Pipe to the next world with either a hammer or a wrench (with the exception of the red Sprixie Princess, since she was recaptured after she was saved in World Castle (World 7) and she only helped build a rocket ship). It is possible for the player to skip saving the first and fourth Sprixie Princesses if they take the secret exits found in World 1 and World 4, respectively, although as a result they will be entirely absent during the ending and when Bowser recaptures them.\n\nThe group eventually manages to rescue the last of the seven Sprixie Princesses after defeating Bowser in his car for the second time in World Castle (World 7), seemingly the last stage of the game. However, Bowser promptly reappears, stuffs all seven princesses into a larger bottle, and flees to World Bowser (World 8), a Bowser-themed carnival area that serves as the true final world of the main game. Here, Bowser confronts the heroes after transforming into Meowser and is defeated, dropping the Sprixie Princesses in the process. The princesses then use their powers to undo all the harm done to their land before waving goodbye to the heroes as they return to the Mushroom Kingdom via a Clear Pipe.\n\nAfter the ending credits, the Sprixie Princesses build a rocket ship in World 1 for the player to use in order to travel to the secret bonus worlds in outer space (Star, Mushroom, Flower, and Crown).\n\nThe green Sprixie Princess is also playable in ''[[Mario Tennis: Ultra Smash]]''.\n\n===Tiara===\n{{nihongo foot|'''Tiara'''|\u30c6\u30a3\u30a2\u30e9|Tiara|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is the secondary damsel in distress in ''[[Super Mario Odyssey]]''. She is the sister of Cappy, who is kidnapped by [[Bowser (character)|Bowser]] as a gift to [[Princess Peach]] to wear on their wedding day.\n\n===Toad Brigade===\nThe {{nihongo foot|'''Toad Brigade'''|\u30ad\u30ce\u30d4\u30aa\u63a2\u691c\u968a|Kinopio Tankentai|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is a group of five Toads that aid Mario through some games, starting with ''[[Super Mario Galaxy]]''. They are led by Captain Toad. Later the group would expand to include Toadette, bringing the membership up to six. The members consist of Captain Toad, Toadette, Hint Toad (blue), Yellow Toad, Banktoad (green), and Mailtoad (magenta).\n\n===Toadsworth===\n{{nihongo foot|'''Toadsworth'''|\u30ad\u30ce\u3058\u3044|Kinojii|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is an elderly Toad and Princess Peach's longtime [[Steward (office)|steward]], first appearing in ''[[Super Mario Sunshine]]'', when he comes along with Princess Peach and Mario to Isle Delfino. He makes a brief appearance in ''[[Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga]]'' at the beginning (where he presents Mario and Luigi with a suitcase) and end of the game.\n\nPaper Toadsworth accompanies Paper Princess Peach on her trip to Rogueport during ''[[Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door]]'', keeping Paper Peach very close to him, but ends up losing her.\n\nIn ''[[Mario & Luigi: Partners in Time]]'', he is with Mario and Luigi when Princess Peach takes an experimental trip back in time. He is also included in ''[[Super Princess Peach]]'' where he gives Peach a parasol named Perry in the cinema and is seen as a lead guitarist of the band called Peach Hit Five in the music room.\n\nHe also appears in ''[[Mario & Luigi: Bowser's Inside Story]]'' and its 3DS remake where he was inhaled by Bowser. In ''[[Mario & Luigi: Dream Team]]'', Toadsworth appeared as the gang went on a vacation in Pi'illo Island.\n\nToadsworth makes a brief appearance in ''[[Mario Kart: Double Dash]]'' when the player wins a cup. He acts as an umpire in ''[[Mario Power Tennis]]'' for the [[GameCube]] as well as in the [[remake]] for the [[Wii]], in which Toadsworth reprimands the player when a foul shot is made. In ''[[Mario Party 7]]'', he is a host of the boards. He finally becomes playable in both ''[[Mario Superstar Baseball]]'' and ''[[Mario Super Sluggers]]''.\n\nToadsworth is voiced by [[Charles Martinet]], who also voices [[Mario]], [[Luigi]], [[Wario]] and [[Waluigi]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Fenech |first=Stephen |url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/entertainment/meet-the-voice-of-super-mario-charles-martinet/story-e6frewyr-1225772856617 |title=Meet the voice of Super Mario Charles Martinet |publisher=Dailytelegraph.com.au |date=2009-09-14 |accessdate=2010-08-05}}</ref> N-Philes criticized Toadsworth's voice in ''[[Super Mario Sunshine]]'', calling it \"laughable\", \"comical\", and \"utterly pessimistic\".<ref>{{cite web |author=Gareth Trinkwon |url=http://www.n-philes.com/reviews/63/super-mario-sunshine/ |archive-url=https://archive.today/20120903145402/http://www.n-philes.com/reviews/63/super-mario-sunshine/ |url-status=dead |archive-date=2012-09-03 |title=News :: Super Mario Sunshine |publisher=N-Philes |accessdate=2010-04-08 }}</ref>\n\n==Supporting antagonists==\n===Boom Boom===\n{{nihongo foot|'''Boom Boom'''|\u30d6\u30f3\u30d6\u30f3|Bunbun|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} is the henchman and faithful servant of Bowser. He first appeared in ''[[Super Mario Bros. 3]]'' as one of the main antagonists of the game, where he often fights with Mario or Luigi by chasing him flailing his arms, jumping high and flying at them. Boom Boom returned in ''[[Super Mario 3D Land]]'' 23 years after their last appearance. He resides in various airships where he encounters Mario. In ''[[New Super Mario Bros. U]]'', he reprises his old role from ''Super Mario Bros. 3'', guarding the fortresses and towers.\n\nIn four episodes of ''[[The Adventures of Super Mario Bros. 3]]'', Boom Boom appears as a silent powerhouse who often cause troubles to Mario and Luigi.\n\n===Broodals===\nThe {{nihongo foot|'''Broodals'''|\u30d6\u30eb\u30fc\u30c0\u30eb\u30ba|Bur\u016bdaruzu|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} are a group of villainous anthropomorphic [[rabbit]]s who double as wedding planners in ''[[Super Mario Odyssey]]''. Their boss is Madame Broode. They were hired by Bowser in order to stop Mario from reaching him. The members consist of Topper, Hariet, Rango and Spewart.\n\n===Draggadon===\n{{nihongo foot|'''Draggadons'''|\u30c9\u30e9\u30b4\u30c9\u30f3|Doragodon|lead=yes|group=lower-alpha}} are [[dragon]]s first appearing in the game ''[[Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker]]''. Although in said game only Draggadon, the king of an isolated volcano called Pyropuff Peak, and Gold Draggadon, the king of the Golden Realm.\n\nThe first, named Draggadon, is fought in Episode 1-10: The King of Pyropuff Peak, Episode 2-9: Draggadon's Revenge, and Bonus Episode-11: Mummy-Me at Pyropuff Peak. When Captain Toad is chasing Wingo who kidnapped Toadette, he accidentally comes across Pyropuff Peak. Draggadon attacks him, thinking him to be an intruder, but after the fight realizes that he was innocent, and allows him to ride on his head as the two conquer hordes of enemies. Toadette in her pursuit of Wingo also ends up at Pyropuff Peak, which results in the same situation playing.

After being defeated by the Star Kid, Twink, she continued to work for him. In ''[[Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door]]'', she acted as Bowser's second-in-command.

Cooke is best known for his death in hand-to-hand combat with French forces during the [[Battle of Trafalgar]] in 1805. During the action, his ship {{HMS|Bellerophon|1786|6}} was badly damaged and boarded by sailors and marines from the French [[ship of the line]] {{Ship|French ship|Aigle|1800|2}}. Cooke was killed in the ensuing melee, but his crew successfully drove off their opponents and ultimately forced the surrender of ''Aigle''.\n\nAside from his death, remarkably little is known of Cooke's circumstances, as unlike many of his fellow officers, Cooke was never a notable society figure. He was however well respected in his profession and following his death was the subject of tributes from officers who had served alongside him. Memorials to him were placed in [[St Paul's Cathedral]] and his local church in [[Wiltshire]].\n\n==Early life==\nJohn Cooke was born on 17 February 1762, the second son of Francis Cooke, an [[Admiralty]] clerk, and his wife, Margaret, n\u00e9e Baker.{{r|\"JJH:51\"}}{{r|\"NT:95\"}}{{NoteTag|name=\"EFN:Baptism\"}} Francis had married Margaret at St{{nbsp}}Mary's, [[Chatham, Kent]], on 29 May 1757.{{r|\"JJH:51\"}} Cooke was baptised on 5 March 1762, at the Cooke's home in the [[Tenterground]] at [[Goodman's Fields]], in the parish of [[St. Mary, Whitechapel]]. Sir [[HMS Bentley|John Bentley]] and William Henry Ricketts, were [[Godparent|godfathers]], Mrs Pigott of [[Bloomsbury Square]], was godmother.{{r|\"JJH:51\"}}{{NoteTag|name=\"EFN:Godparents\"}}\n\nJohn Cooke first went to sea at the age of eleven aboard the [[cutter (boat)|cutter]] {{HMS|Greyhound|1763|6}} under Lieutenant [[John Bazely]], before going ashore to spend time at Mr Braken's naval academy at [[Greenwich]]. He was entered onto the books of one of the [[royal yacht]]s by [[Alexander Hood, 1st Viscount Bridport|Sir Alexander Hood]], who would become an enduring patron of Cooke's.{{r|\"NT:95\"}} In 1776 he obtained a position as a [[midshipman]] on the [[ship of the line]] {{HMS|Eagle|1774|6}}, aged thirteen.{{r|\"CW:48\"}} Cooke served aboard ''Eagle'', the flagship of the [[North American Station]], during the next three years, seeing extensive action along the eastern seaboard. Notable among these actions were the naval operations around the [[Battle of Rhode Island]] in 1778, when ''Eagle'' was closely engaged with American units ashore.{{r|\"ODNB\"}} He distinguished himself in the assault, causing Admiral [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Lord Howe]] to remark \"Why, young man, you wish to become a Lieutenant before you are of sufficient age.\"{{r|\"NT:95\"}} On 21 January 1779, Cooke was promoted to [[lieutenant]] and joined {{HMS|Superb|1760|6}} in the East Indies under [[Edward Hughes (Royal Navy officer)|Sir Edward Hughes]], but was forced to take a leave of absence due to ill-health.{{r|\"NT:95\"}}\n\nCooke returned to England and then went to France to spend a year studying, before rejoining the navy in 1782 with an appointment to the 90-gun {{HMS|Duke|1777|6}} under Captain [[Alan Gardner, 1st Baron Gardner|Alan Gardner]].{{r|\"NT:95\"}} Cooke saw action at the [[Battle of the Saintes]], at which ''Duke'' was heavily engaged. He remained with Gardner following the signing of the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1783, bringing an end to the American War of Independence, and served as his first-lieutenant aboard his next command, the 50-gun {{HMS|Europa|1783|6}}.{{r|\"NT:95\"}} Gardner became commodore at [[Jamaica]], flying his [[broad pennant]] aboard ''Europa'' and retaining Cooke as his first-lieutenant until Cooke was injured in a bad fall and had to be invalided home.{{r|\"NT:95\"}} He had recovered sufficiently by the time of the [[Spanish Armament]] in 1790 to be able to take up an appointment from his old patron, Sir Alexander Hood, to be third-lieutenant of his flagship, the 90-gun {{HMS|London|1766|6}}.{{r|\"NT:95\"}}{{r|\"ODNB\"}} When the crisis passed without breaking into open war, ''London'' was paid off and Cooke went ashore.{{r|\"NT:95\"}}\n\n==Frigate command==\nWith the outbreak of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] in February 1793, Cooke rejoined Hood and became first-lieutenant of his new flagship, the 100-gun {{HMS|Royal George|1788|6}}, part of the [[Channel Fleet]]. On 21 February 1794, Cooke was promoted to [[commander]] and given his first independent command, the small [[fireship]] {{HMS|Incendiary|1782|6}}. Three months later, ''Incendiary'' was a signal repeater for the Channel Fleet during the [[Atlantic campaign of May 1794]], relaying [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Lord Howe's]] signals to the fleet and operating as a scout in the search for the French fleet under [[Villaret de Joyeuse]]. On 1 June 1794, Cooke was a witness to the battle of the [[Glorious First of June]], although his tiny ship was far too small to engage in combat.{{r|\"JW1:126\"}} In the action's aftermath, Cooke was included in the general promotions issued to the fleet, becoming a [[post captain]] on 23 July 1794. For a year, Cooke was stationed off [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] as [[flag captain]] to [[James Wallace (Royal Navy officer)|Sir James Wallace]] aboard the 74-gun {{HMS|Monarch|1765|6}}, before returning to Britain and being offered command of the 28-gun {{HMS|Tourterelle|1795|6}}.{{r|\"NT:96\"}} Cooke accepted, but when he found out she was ordered to the West Indies, he resigned it, having been told by Gardner that further service in the West Indies would likely kill him.{{r|\"NT:96\"}}\n\nInstead in early 1796 he took command of the 36-gun [[frigate]] {{HMS|Nymphe|1780|6}}. ''Nymphe'' was employed in the blockade of the French Atlantic ports over the next year, and on 9 March 1797 was in company with {{HMS|St Fiorenzo|1794|6}} when they encountered the returning ships of a short-lived [[Battle of Fishguard|French invasion attempt]] of Britain that had been defeated at [[Fishguard]] in [[Wales]].{{r|\"JW2:80\"}} The French ships attempted to escape into [[Brest, France|Brest]], but were hunted down by the British, who forced the surrender of [[French ship R\u00e9sistance|''R\u00e9sistance'']] and [[French ship Constance|''Constance'']] in turn after successive short engagements.{{r|\"JH:45\"}} Neither of the British ships suffered a single casualty in the combat, and both French ships were subsequently purchased into the Royal Navy, bringing [[prize money]] to Cooke and his crew.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=14035|page=764|date=8 August 1797}}</ref>\n\nDespite this success, Cooke was unpopular with his men due to the strict discipline he enforced aboard his ship. This was graphically demonstrated just two months after the action off Brest, when ''Nymphe'' became embroiled in the [[Spithead and Nore mutinies|Spithead mutiny]]. Cooke attempted to assist Admiral [[John Colpoys]] at the mutiny's outbreak, and was ordered ashore by his crew when he tried to return to his ship. Cooke was tactfully removed from command by the Admiralty following the mutiny, although he was returned to service two years later aboard the new frigate {{HMS|Amethyst|1799|6}} in preparation for the Anglo-Russian invasion of the [[Batavian Republic]].{{r|\"CW:48\"}} During the invasion, ''Amethyst'' conveyed the [[Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany|Duke of York]] to the Netherlands and later participated in the evacuation of the force following the campaign's collapse.{{r|\"NT:96\"}}\n\nCooke was involved in operations in [[Quiberon Bay]] during the remainder of 1799, and in 1800 participated in an abortive invasion of [[Ferrol, Spain|Ferrol]]. During this time, ''Amethyst'' captured six French merchant ships and small privateers.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=15301|page=1176|date=11 October 1800}}</ref> During 1801, Cooke participated in the capture of the {{Ship|French frigate|D\u00e9daigneuse|1797|2|up=yes}} off [[Cape Finisterre]], helping [[Samuel Hood Linzee]] and [[Sir Richard King, 2nd Baronet|Richard King]] chase her down on 26 January. ''Amethyst'' was not heavily engaged with ''D\u00e9daigneuse'' and received no damage, but aided in pursuing and trapping the French ship so that she could be seized. ''D\u00e9daigneuse'' was later purchased into the Royal Navy as HMS ''Dedaigneuse''.{{r|\"JW3:136\"}} Shortly afterwards, Cooke captured the Spanish ship ''Carlotta'' and the French [[privateer]] ''G\u00e9n\u00e9ral Brune'' in the same area.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=15412|page=1203|date=29 September 1801}}</ref>\n\n==Trafalgar==\n[[File:Trafalgar aufstellung.jpg|thumb|Battle of Trafalgar]]\nWith the [[Peace of Amiens]], Cooke briefly retired on half-pay before being recalled to the fleet at the outbreak of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] in 1803. Cooke was requested as flag captain by Admiral [[William Young (1751\u20131821)|Sir William Young]] at [[Plymouth]], but Cooke tactfully refused, instead applying for active service. He received command of {{HMS|Bellerophon|1786|6}} on 25 April 1805. In May, after the large combined French and Spanish fleet, under Admiral [[Pierre-Charles Villeneuve]] escaped from [[Toulon]], beginning the [[Trafalgar Campaign]], Cooke was ordered to join a flying squadron under Vice-Admiral [[Cuthbert Collingwood, 1st Baron Collingwood|Cuthbert Collingwood]]. The squadron arrived off [[Cadiz]] on 9 June and Collingwood detached ''Bellerophon'' and three other ships to blockade [[Cartagena, Spain|Cartagena]] under Rear-Admiral [[Sir Richard Bickerton, 2nd Baronet|Sir Richard Bickerton]]. When the combined fleet entered Cadiz on 20 August, Collingwood recalled Bickerton's force and mounted a blockade of the port. Collingwood was reinforced with more ships, and was later superseded by Nelson. Cooke was heard to say at this time that \"To be in a general engagement with [[Horatio Nelson|Nelson]] would crown all my military ambition\".{{r|\"ODNB\"}} Nelson had Villeneuve's fleet trapped in Cadiz and was blockading the harbour awaiting their expected attempt to escape.\n\nThe Franco-Spanish fleet escaped Cadiz on 18 October 1805, but was soon chased down by Nelson and brought to battle on 21 October. Nelson formed his fleet into two divisions; the weather column would attack to the north under his direct command and the lee column would operate to the south under the command of Cuthbert Collingwood in {{HMS|Royal Sovereign|1786|6}}. Cooke was stationed fifth in Collingwood's line, and so was one of the first ships engaged in action with the combined fleet. Cooke took the unusual step of informing his first lieutenant [[William Pryce Cumby]] and his master Edward Overton of Nelson's orders, in case he should be killed.{{r|\"CW:47\"}}\n\n''Bellerophon'' was soon closely engaged with the French, breaking through the enemy line and closing with [[French ship Aigle (1800)|''Aigle'']]. As with the other French ships in the fleet, ''Aigle's'' rigging and mastheads were occupied by musketeers and grenadiers, who kept up a steady fire on ''Bellerophon'' and took a heavy toll of sailors exposed on the British ship's deck. Much of the fire was directed at the quarterdeck, where Cooke, Cumby and Overton stood. Cumby noted with surprise that Cooke was still wearing his uniform coat, which sported epaulettes that marked him out as the ship's captain to French snipers. Cooke had forgotten to remove the epaulettes and recognised the danger they represented, but replied \"It is too late to take them off. I see my situation, but I will die like a man\".{{r|\"CW:48\"}}\n[[File:Situation of the Bellerophon at the moment of the death of her gallant commander Captn. Cooke.jpg|left|thumb|alt=Coloured print of a naval battle between sailing ships.

Cooke sent Cumby below to make sure that the lower-deck guns continued to fire into the French ship as the battle continued overhead, and threw himself at the French sailors pouring onto ''Bellerophon's'' quarterdeck, shooting an enemy officer dead and engaging in hand-to-hand combat with the men behind him.{{r|\"CW:48\"}} Within minutes Cumby had returned to the deck with reinforcements from below, passing the mortally wounded Overton on the ladder. The badly wounded ship's quartermaster was also present, and he informed Cumby that Cooke had fallen in the melee.{{r|\"JW4:52\"}} Cumby's charge cleared the French from the deck of ''Bellerophon'', and he found Cooke dead on the quarterdeck, two [[musket]] balls lodged in his chest. Cooke's last words had been \"Let me lie quietly a minute. Tell Lieutenant Cumby never to strike.\"{{r|\"CW:48\"}}\n\nCumby took charge of the battered ''Bellerophon'', directing her fire into ''Aigle'' and ultimately forcing the French ship's surrender after the arrival of other British vessels. ''Bellerophon'' had suffered grievously, losing 27 dead and 127 wounded.{{r|\"JW4:52\"}} Although ''Aigle'' was lost in the chaotic storm which followed the battle, ''Bellerophon'' survived, primarily due to Cumby's leadership. He was later promoted to post captain for his services in the action.{{r|\"CW:52\"}} Cooke's body was [[buried at sea]] the day after the battle with the other fatal casualties from ''Bellerophon''.{{r|\"ODNB\"}}\n{{clear}}\n\n==Family and legacy==\n[[File:Tomb of Horatio Nelson on Saint-Paul Cathedral.jpg|thumb|left|Tribute to Cooke on left in the crypt of St Pauls Cathedral]]\n[[File:St Andrew's Church, Donhead St Andrew 16.JPG|thumb|right|upright=1|Memorial to Cooke in St{{nbsp}}Andrew's Church, Donhead St{{nbsp}}Andrew, in Wiltshire]]\nCooke's death, as with those of [[George Duff]] and Admiral Nelson himself, was widely mourned in Britain. Cooke's widow Louisa and their eight-year-old daughter, Louisa Charlotte, were given numerous awards and presents, including the gold medal minted for the captains who had fought at the action, and a large silver vase presented by [[Lloyd's Patriotic Fund]]. Caroline Augusta Rolles, Cooke's great-granddaughter, gifted the gold medal and vase to the nation after her death in January 1931.{{r|\"CAR:Gift\"}} At least some of the money the family received was spent on a large wall plaque mounted in St Andrew's Church in [[Donhead St Andrew]] in [[Wiltshire]], close to the family home at Donhead Lodge on [[Barkers Hill]].{{r|\"CW:49\"}}{{r|DH:30}} The plaque commemorates Cooke's life and death and also that of his wife. A memorial was also raised to him in [[St Paul's Cathedral]]. Tributes from fellow officers were also forthcoming, including from the future explorer [[John Franklin]], who had served on ''Bellerophon'' at Trafalgar and had said of Cooke that he was \"very gentlemanly and active.

Cooke is best known for his death in hand-to-hand combat with French forces during the [[Battle of Trafalgar]] in 1805. During the action, his ship {{HMS|Bellerophon|1786|6}} was badly damaged and boarded by sailors and marines from the French [[ship of the line]] {{Ship|French ship|Aigle|1800|2}}. Cooke was killed in the ensuing melee, but his crew successfully drove off their opponents and ultimately forced the surrender of ''Aigle''.\n\nAside from his death, remarkably little is known of Cooke's circumstances, as unlike many of his fellow officers, Cooke was never a notable society figure. He was however well respected in his profession and following his death was the subject of tributes from officers who had served alongside him. Memorials to him were placed in [[St Paul's Cathedral]] and his local church in [[Wiltshire]].\n\n==Early life==\nJohn Cooke was born on 17 February 1762, the second son of Francis Cooke, an [[Admiralty]] clerk, and his wife, Margaret, n\u00e9e Baker.{{r|\"JJH:51\"}}{{r|\"NT:95\"}}{{NoteTag|name=\"EFN:Baptism\"}} Francis had married Margaret at St{{nbsp}}Mary's, [[Chatham, Kent]], on 29 May 1757.{{r|\"JJH:51\"}} Cooke was baptised on 5 March 1762, at the Cooke's home in the [[Tenterground]] at [[Goodman's Fields]], in the parish of [[St. Mary, Whitechapel]]. Sir [[HMS Bentley|John Bentley]] and William Henry Ricketts, were [[Godparent|godfathers]], Mrs Pigott of [[Bloomsbury Square]], was godmother.{{r|\"JJH:51\"}}{{NoteTag|name=\"EFN:Godparents\"}}\n\nJohn Cooke first went to sea at the age of eleven aboard the [[cutter (boat)|cutter]] {{HMS|Greyhound|1763|6}} under Lieutenant [[John Bazely]], before going ashore to spend time at Mr Braken's naval academy at [[Greenwich]]. He was entered onto the books of one of the [[royal yacht]]s by [[Alexander Hood, 1st Viscount Bridport|Sir Alexander Hood]], who would become an enduring patron of Cooke's.{{r|\"NT:95\"}} In 1776 he obtained a position as a [[midshipman]] on the [[ship of the line]] {{HMS|Eagle|1774|6}}, aged thirteen.{{r|\"CW:48\"}} Cooke served aboard ''Eagle'', the flagship of the [[North American Station]], during the next three years, seeing extensive action along the eastern seaboard. Notable among these actions were the naval operations around the [[Battle of Rhode Island]] in 1778, when ''Eagle'' was closely engaged with American units ashore.{{r|\"ODNB\"}} He distinguished himself in the assault, causing Admiral [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Lord Howe]] to remark \"Why, young man, you wish to become a Lieutenant before you are of sufficient age.\"{{r|\"NT:95\"}} On 21 January 1779, Cooke was promoted to [[lieutenant]] and joined {{HMS|Superb|1760|6}} in the East Indies under [[Edward Hughes (Royal Navy officer)|Sir Edward Hughes]], but was forced to take a leave of absence due to ill-health.{{r|\"NT:95\"}}\n\nCooke returned to England and then went to France to spend a year studying, before rejoining the navy in 1782 with an appointment to the 90-gun {{HMS|Duke|1777|6}} under Captain [[Alan Gardner, 1st Baron Gardner|Alan Gardner]].{{r|\"NT:95\"}} Cooke saw action at the [[Battle of the Saintes]], at which ''Duke'' was heavily engaged. He remained with Gardner following the signing of the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1783, bringing an end to the American War of Independence, and served as his first-lieutenant aboard his next command, the 50-gun {{HMS|Europa|1783|6}}.{{r|\"NT:95\"}} Gardner became commodore at [[Jamaica]], flying his [[broad pennant]] aboard ''Europa'' and retaining Cooke as his first-lieutenant until Cooke was injured in a bad fall and had to be invalided home.{{r|\"NT:95\"}} He had recovered sufficiently by the time of the [[Spanish Armament]] in 1790 to be able to take up an appointment from his old patron, Sir Alexander Hood, to be third-lieutenant of his flagship, the 90-gun {{HMS|London|1766|6}}.{{r|\"NT:95\"}}{{r|\"ODNB\"}} When the crisis passed without breaking into open war, ''London'' was paid off and Cooke went ashore.{{r|\"NT:95\"}}\n\n==Frigate command==\nWith the outbreak of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] in February 1793, Cooke rejoined Hood and became first-lieutenant of his new flagship, the 100-gun {{HMS|Royal George|1788|6}}, part of the [[Channel Fleet]]. On 21 February 1794, Cooke was promoted to [[commander]] and given his first independent command, the small [[fireship]] {{HMS|Incendiary|1782|6}}. Three months later, ''Incendiary'' was a signal repeater for the Channel Fleet during the [[Atlantic campaign of May 1794]], relaying [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Lord Howe's]] signals to the fleet and operating as a scout in the search for the French fleet under [[Villaret de Joyeuse]]. On 1 June 1794, Cooke was a witness to the battle of the [[Glorious First of June]], although his tiny ship was far too small to engage in combat.{{r|\"JW1:126\"}} In the action's aftermath, Cooke was included in the general promotions issued to the fleet, becoming a [[post captain]] on 23 July 1794. For a year, Cooke was stationed off [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] as [[flag captain]] to [[James Wallace (Royal Navy officer)|Sir James Wallace]] aboard the 74-gun {{HMS|Monarch|1765|6}}, before returning to Britain and being offered command of the 28-gun {{HMS|Tourterelle|1795|6}}.{{r|\"NT:96\"}} Cooke accepted, but when he found out she was ordered to the West Indies, he resigned it, having been told by Gardner that further service in the West Indies would likely kill him.{{r|\"NT:96\"}}\n\nInstead in early 1796 he took command of the 36-gun [[frigate]] {{HMS|Nymphe|1780|6}}. ''Nymphe'' was employed in the blockade of the French Atlantic ports over the next year, and on 9 March 1797 was in company with {{HMS|St Fiorenzo|1794|6}} when they encountered the returning ships of a short-lived [[Battle of Fishguard|French invasion attempt]] of Britain that had been defeated at [[Fishguard]] in [[Wales]].{{r|\"JW2:80\"}} The French ships attempted to escape into [[Brest, France|Brest]], but were hunted down by the British, who forced the surrender of [[French ship R\u00e9sistance|''R\u00e9sistance'']] and [[French ship Constance|''Constance'']] in turn after successive short engagements.{{r|\"JH:45\"}} Neither of the British ships suffered a single casualty in the combat, and both French ships were subsequently purchased into the Royal Navy, bringing [[prize money]] to Cooke and his crew.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=14035|page=764|date=8 August 1797}}</ref>\n\nDespite this success, Cooke was unpopular with his men due to the strict discipline he enforced aboard his ship. This was graphically demonstrated just two months after the action off Brest, when ''Nymphe'' became embroiled in the [[Spithead and Nore mutinies|Spithead mutiny]]. Cooke attempted to assist Admiral [[John Colpoys]] at the mutiny's outbreak, and was ordered ashore by his crew when he tried to return to his ship. Cooke was tactfully removed from command by the Admiralty following the mutiny, although he was returned to service two years later aboard the new frigate {{HMS|Amethyst|1799|6}} in preparation for the Anglo-Russian invasion of the [[Batavian Republic]].{{r|\"CW:48\"}} During the invasion, ''Amethyst'' conveyed the [[Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany|Duke of York]] to the Netherlands and later participated in the evacuation of the force following the campaign's collapse.{{r|\"NT:96\"}}\n\nCooke was involved in operations in [[Quiberon Bay]] during the remainder of 1799, and in 1800 participated in an abortive invasion of [[Ferrol, Spain|Ferrol]]. During this time, ''Amethyst'' captured six French merchant ships and small privateers.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=15301|page=1176|date=11 October 1800}}</ref> During 1801, Cooke participated in the capture of the {{Ship|French frigate|D\u00e9daigneuse|1797|2|up=yes}} off [[Cape Finisterre]], helping [[Samuel Hood Linzee]] and [[Sir Richard King, 2nd Baronet|Richard King]] chase her down on 26 January. ''Amethyst'' was not heavily engaged with ''D\u00e9daigneuse'' and received no damage, but aided in pursuing and trapping the French ship so that she could be seized. ''D\u00e9daigneuse'' was later purchased into the Royal Navy as HMS ''Dedaigneuse''.{{r|\"JW3:136\"}} Shortly afterwards, Cooke captured the Spanish ship ''Carlotta'' and the French [[privateer]] ''G\u00e9n\u00e9ral Brune'' in the same area.<ref>{{London Gazette|issue=15412|page=1203|date=29 September 1801}}</ref>\n\n==Trafalgar==\n[[File:Trafalgar aufstellung.jpg|thumb|Battle of Trafalgar]]\nWith the [[Peace of Amiens]], Cooke briefly retired on half-pay before being recalled to the fleet at the outbreak of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] in 1803. Cooke was requested as flag captain by Admiral [[William Young (1751\u20131821)|Sir William Young]] at [[Plymouth]], but Cooke tactfully refused, instead applying for active service. He received command of {{HMS|Bellerophon|1786|6}} on 25 April 1805. In May, after the large combined French and Spanish fleet, under Admiral [[Pierre-Charles Villeneuve]] escaped from [[Toulon]], beginning the [[Trafalgar Campaign]], Cooke was ordered to join a flying squadron under Vice-Admiral [[Cuthbert Collingwood, 1st Baron Collingwood|Cuthbert Collingwood]]. The squadron arrived off [[Cadiz]] on 9 June and Collingwood detached ''Bellerophon'' and three other ships to blockade [[Cartagena, Spain|Cartagena]] under Rear-Admiral [[Sir Richard Bickerton, 2nd Baronet|Sir Richard Bickerton]]. When the combined fleet entered Cadiz on 20 August, Collingwood recalled Bickerton's force and mounted a blockade of the port. Collingwood was reinforced with more ships, and was later superseded by Nelson. Cooke was heard to say at this time that \"To be in a general engagement with [[Horatio Nelson|Nelson]] would crown all my military ambition\".{{r|\"ODNB\"}} Nelson had Villeneuve's fleet trapped in Cadiz and was blockading the harbour awaiting their expected attempt to escape.\n\nThe Franco-Spanish fleet escaped Cadiz on 18 October 1805, but was soon chased down by Nelson and brought to battle on 21 October. Nelson formed his fleet into two divisions; the weather column would attack to the north under his direct command and the lee column would operate to the south under the command of Cuthbert Collingwood in {{HMS|Royal Sovereign|1786|6}}. Cooke was stationed fifth in Collingwood's line, and so was one of the first ships engaged in action with the combined fleet. Cooke took the unusual step of informing his first lieutenant [[William Pryce Cumby]] and his master Edward Overton of Nelson's orders, in case he should be killed.{{r|\"CW:47\"}}\n\n''Bellerophon'' was soon closely engaged with the French, breaking through the enemy line and closing with [[French ship Aigle (1800)|''Aigle'']]. As with the other French ships in the fleet, ''Aigle's'' rigging and mastheads were occupied by musketeers and grenadiers, who kept up a steady fire on ''Bellerophon'' and took a heavy toll of sailors exposed on the British ship's deck. Much of the fire was directed at the quarterdeck, where Cooke, Cumby and Overton stood. Cumby noted with surprise that Cooke was still wearing his uniform coat, which sported epaulettes that marked him out as the ship's captain to French snipers. Cooke had forgotten to remove the epaulettes and recognised the danger they represented, but replied \"It is too late to take them off. I see my situation, but I will die like a man\".{{r|\"CW:48\"}}\n[[File:Situation of the Bellerophon at the moment of the death of her gallant commander Captn. Cooke.jpg|left|thumb|alt=Coloured print of a naval battle between sailing ships. Four ships seen stern on in the right of the picture, obscured by clouds of smoke, a fifth ship seen bow on in the left.|''Situation of the Bellerophon at the moment of the death of her gallant commander Captn. Cooke'', early-nineteenth century aquatint by [[Thomas Whitcombe]], showing the ''Bellerophon'' surrounded by enemy ships at the moment of Cooke's death]]\nAs the action continued, the Captain Pierre-Paul Gour\u00e8ge of ''Aigle'' ordered his crew to board and seize ''Bellerophon'', hoping to use their superiority of numbers to overwhelm the British crew. Cooke sent Cumby below to make sure that the lower-deck guns continued to fire into the French ship as the battle continued overhead, and threw himself at the French sailors pouring onto ''Bellerophon's'' quarterdeck, shooting an enemy officer dead and engaging in hand-to-hand combat with the men behind him.{{r|\"CW:48\"}} Within minutes Cumby had returned to the deck with reinforcements from below, passing the mortally wounded Overton on the ladder. The badly wounded ship's quartermaster was also present, and he informed Cumby that Cooke had fallen in the melee.{{r|\"JW4:52\"}} Cumby's charge cleared the French from the deck of ''Bellerophon'', and he found Cooke dead on the quarterdeck, two [[musket]] balls lodged in his chest. Cooke's last words had been \"Let me lie quietly a minute. Tell Lieutenant Cumby never to strike.\"{{r|\"CW:48\"}}\n\nCumby took charge of the battered ''Bellerophon'', directing her fire into ''Aigle'' and ultimately forcing the French ship's surrender after the arrival of other British vessels. ''Bellerophon'' had suffered grievously, losing 27 dead and 127 wounded.{{r|\"JW4:52\"}} Although ''Aigle'' was lost in the chaotic storm which followed the battle, ''Bellerophon'' survived, primarily due to Cumby's leadership. He was later promoted to post captain for his services in the action.{{r|\"CW:52\"}} Cooke's body was [[buried at sea]] the day after the battle with the other fatal casualties from ''Bellerophon''.{{r|\"ODNB\"}}\n{{clear}}\n\n==Family and legacy==\n[[File:Tomb of Horatio Nelson on Saint-Paul Cathedral.jpg|thumb|left|Tribute to Cooke on left in the crypt of St Pauls Cathedral]]\n[[File:St Andrew's Church, Donhead St Andrew 16.JPG|thumb|right|upright=1|Memorial to Cooke in St{{nbsp}}Andrew's Church, Donhead St{{nbsp}}Andrew, in Wiltshire]]\nCooke's death, as with those of [[George Duff]] and Admiral Nelson himself, was widely mourned in Britain. Cooke's widow Louisa and their eight-year-old daughter, Louisa Charlotte, were given numerous awards and presents, including the gold medal minted for the captains who had fought at the action, and a large silver vase presented by [[Lloyd's Patriotic Fund]]. Caroline Augusta Rolles, Cooke's great-granddaughter, gifted the gold medal and vase to the nation after her death in January 1931.{{r|\"CAR:Gift\"}} At least some of the money the family received was spent on a large wall plaque mounted in St Andrew's Church in [[Donhead St Andrew]] in [[Wiltshire]], close to the family home at Donhead Lodge on [[Barkers Hill]].{{r|\"CW:49\"}}{{r|DH:30}} The plaque commemorates Cooke's life and death and also that of his wife. A memorial was also raised to him in [[St Paul's Cathedral]]. Tributes from fellow officers were also forthcoming, including from the future explorer [[John Franklin]], who had served on ''Bellerophon'' at Trafalgar and had said of Cooke that he was \"very gentlemanly and active. I like his appearance very much.\"{{r|\"CW:48\"}} A number of letters that Cooke wrote to his brother prior to Trafalgar are held by the [[National Maritime Museum]].{{r|\"National Archives\"}}\n\nCooke had married Louisa, n\u00e9e Hardy, on 15 June 1790 at [[St Leonard's, Shoreditch]]. Louisa was the fourth daughter of [[Josiah Hardy]], the former Governor of New Jersey, and later consul at Cadiz.{{r|\"NT:95\"}} Cooke leased Donhead Lodge from Baron [[Henry Arundell, 8th Baron Arundell of Wardour|Henry Arundell]] in 1803 and Louisa remained in residence there until 1813.{{r|\"JC:Donhead Lodge Release\"}}{{r|DH:30}} She died at her home, 9 Montpellier Terrace, [[Montpellier, Cheltenham]], on 5 February 1853 aged 96.{{r|\"LC:Death\"}} The funeral was held at [[St Peter's Church, Leckhampton]], on 11 February 1853, with interment following in the churchyard.{{r|\"LC:Funeral\"}} Louisa Charlotte Cooke, their only child, was born on 26 January 1797 at [[Stoke Damerel]].{{r|\"NT:95\"}} Louisa Charlotte married Abraham John Newenham Devonsher of Kilshanick, County Cork, at Cheltenham, on 9 March 1820.{{r|LCC:Marriage}} Formerly of [[Hinton Charterhouse]], she died after a short illness at St. Anne\u2019s, Albion Street, Cheltenham, on 30 April 1871 aged 74.{{r|LCC:Death}} She was interred at Bouncer's Lane Cemetery, [[Prestbury, Gloucestershire|Prestbury]], Cheltenham, on 5 May 1871.{{r|\"LCC:Funeral\"}}\n\n\n==See also==\n* [[Bibliography of 18th\u201319th century Royal Naval history]]\n* [[HMS Bellerophon (1786)|HMS Bellerophon]]\n\n==Notes==\n[[File:Goodman's fields on Roque's map 1746.png|thumb|right|upright=1|The [[Tenterground]] in [[Goodman's Fields]] marked on [[John Rocque's Map of London, 1746]]]]\n{{NoteFoot\n | refs=\n   \n{{NoteTag|name = \"EFN:Baptism\"\n | A number of sources, including T.

Nurse served with the Indian Army. Col. Nurse was one of the small band of naturalists among military officers who devoted their leisure to the study of entomology, and was an enthusiastic collector of Hymenoptera, forming a large and valuable collection which he presented to the Museum a few years ago. The present bequest comprises the remainder of his Indian insects and includes about 1,450 [[Fly|Diptera]] (two winged flies), 1,300 butterflies, 130 dragon-flies and some others; of these the most valuable are the Diptera. The collection is especially rich in species of the family [[Bombyliidae]], most of which are parasitic in the larval state on bees or wasps. Col. Nurse discovered and described fourteen species of this family which were new to science, and [[Type (biology)|types]] of these are in the collection, as well as specimens of a number of other flies which were not previously represented in the Museum. Some interesting butterflies and other insects from Aden are included. \u2013 [[Nature (journal)|''Nature'']], 1934.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=3 March 1934|title=Recent Acquisitions at the Natural History Museum|url=|journal=Nature|volume=133|pages=323\u2013 323|via=}}</ref></blockquote>\n\n==Societies==\nNurse was a member of the [[Bombay Natural History Society]] (Managing Committee).

Nurse served with the Indian Army. Col. Nurse was one of the small band of naturalists among military officers who devoted their leisure to the study of entomology, and was an enthusiastic collector of Hymenoptera, forming a large and valuable collection which he presented to the Museum a few years ago. The present bequest comprises the remainder of his Indian insects and includes about 1,450 [[Fly|Diptera]] (two winged flies), 1,300 butterflies, 130 dragon-flies and some others; of these the most valuable are the Diptera. The collection is especially rich in species of the family [[Bombyliidae]], most of which are parasitic in the larval state on bees or wasps. Col. Nurse discovered and described fourteen species of this family which were new to science, and [[Type (biology)|types]] of these are in the collection, as well as specimens of a number of other flies which were not previously represented in the Museum.

In the males the forewings are black, with veins bordered by whitish colour, while the hindwings are bright yellow. The underside of the wings is quite similar to the upside. The females are larger than the males and have dark-brown or black wings. Head, thorax and abdomen of this butterfly are mainly black, with small red patches on the thorax and a yellow underside of the abdomen. Caterpillars are pale brown, with long protrusions resembling thorns. They mainly feed on ''[[Aristolochia]]'' and ''[[Thottea]]'' species (''[[Aristolochiaceae]]'').\n\n''Troides aeacus'' closely resembles ''[[Troides helena]] cerebrus'' and differs as follows:<br />\n'''Upperside''', ''forewing'': the pale adnervular streaks more prominent, in some specimens extended into the cell along the outer half of the subcostal and of the median nervules. <br />\n''Hindwing'': the cone-shaped terminal black markings in interspaces 2, 3, and 4 more or less broadly bordered on the inner side by a dusky area that is irrorated with blackish scales; the black on the costal margin narrower, not extended below vein 8.\n[[File:PompeopteraAeacusRippon.jpg|thumb|230px|As ''Pompeoptera aeacus'' in [[Robert Henry Fernando Rippon]]'s ''Icones Ornithopterorum'' (1898 to 1906)]]\n'''Underside''' similar to the upperside, but the dusky black borders to the cone-shaped marks in interspaces 2, 3, and 4 wanting.\n\nAntennae, head, thorax, abdomen and abdominal fold as in ''Troides helena cerebrus'', but the abdomen beneath with two rows of black spots.\n\nIn the female the differences from ''cerebrus'' are:<br />\n''Forewing'': the pale adnervular streaks very broad, very prominent and extended well into the cell.<br />\n''Hindwing'': the basal third of the cell and of interspace 2 black, the middle portion of the latter yellow anteriorly, buffy-white posteriorly; the posterior half of the discal area between the postdiscal spots themselves and between them and the terminal cone-shaped markings more or less irrorated with blackish scales; lastly, the black in interspace 7 interrupted by an inner triangular and an outer small yellow spot.\n\nAntennae, head, thorax and abdomen as in ''cerebrus'', but the abdomen beneath with two lateral and two median rows of black spots.<ref name=\"bingham\">{{cite book |last1=Bingham |first1=C.T. |authorlink=Charles Thomas Bingham |title=The Fauna of British India, Including Ceylon and Burma |url=https://archive.org/details/butterflies02bingiala |volume=II |edition=1st |publisher= [[Taylor & Francis|Taylor and Francis, Ltd.]] |location=London |year=1907 }}</ref>\n\n== Range and status ==\nIt is found in northern India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Burma, China, Thailand, Laos, Vietnam, Taiwan, Cambodia, peninsular Malaysia and Indonesia.\n\nIt is generally common and not threatened though it is classified as vulnerable.

The golden birdwing is the national butterfly of [[Bangladesh]], the largest species in the country.\n\n== Description ==\n:''For terms see [[External morphology of Lepidoptera]].''\n\n''Troides aeacus'' has a [[wingspan]] reaching about {{convert|15|-|16|cm}}. In the males the forewings are black, with veins bordered by whitish colour, while the hindwings are bright yellow. The underside of the wings is quite similar to the upside. The females are larger than the males and have dark-brown or black wings. Head, thorax and abdomen of this butterfly are mainly black, with small red patches on the thorax and a yellow underside of the abdomen. Caterpillars are pale brown, with long protrusions resembling thorns. They mainly feed on ''[[Aristolochia]]'' and ''[[Thottea]]'' species (''[[Aristolochiaceae]]'').\n\n''Troides aeacus'' closely resembles ''[[Troides helena]] cerebrus'' and differs as follows:<br />\n'''Upperside''', ''forewing'': the pale adnervular streaks more prominent, in some specimens extended into the cell along the outer half of the subcostal and of the median nervules. <br />\n''Hindwing'': the cone-shaped terminal black markings in interspaces 2, 3, and 4 more or less broadly bordered on the inner side by a dusky area that is irrorated with blackish scales; the black on the costal margin narrower, not extended below vein 8.\n[[File:PompeopteraAeacusRippon.jpg|thumb|230px|As ''Pompeoptera aeacus'' in [[Robert Henry Fernando Rippon]]'s ''Icones Ornithopterorum'' (1898 to 1906)]]\n'''Underside''' similar to the upperside, but the dusky black borders to the cone-shaped marks in interspaces 2, 3, and 4 wanting.\n\nAntennae, head, thorax, abdomen and abdominal fold as in ''Troides helena cerebrus'', but the abdomen beneath with two rows of black spots.\n\nIn the female the differences from ''cerebrus'' are:<br />\n''Forewing'': the pale adnervular streaks very broad, very prominent and extended well into the cell.<br />\n''Hindwing'': the basal third of the cell and of interspace 2 black, the middle portion of the latter yellow anteriorly, buffy-white posteriorly; the posterior half of the discal area between the postdiscal spots themselves and between them and the terminal cone-shaped markings more or less irrorated with blackish scales; lastly, the black in interspace 7 interrupted by an inner triangular and an outer small yellow spot.\n\nAntennae, head, thorax and abdomen as in ''cerebrus'', but the abdomen beneath with two lateral and two median rows of black spots.<ref name=\"bingham\">{{cite book |last1=Bingham |first1=C.T. |authorlink=Charles Thomas Bingham |title=The Fauna of British India, Including Ceylon and Burma |url=https://archive.org/details/butterflies02bingiala |volume=II |edition=1st |publisher= [[Taylor & Francis|Taylor and Francis, Ltd.]] |location=London |year=1907 }}</ref>\n\n== Range and status ==\nIt is found in northern India, Nepal, Bangladesh, Burma, China, Thailand, Laos, Vietnam, Taiwan, Cambodia, peninsular Malaysia and Indonesia.\n\nIt is generally common and not threatened though it is classified as vulnerable.

A squire was typically a teenaged boy, training to become a knight. A boy became a squire at the age of 14.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} Squires were the second step to becoming a knight, after having served as a [[page (occupation)#The medieval page|page]].{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} Boys served a knight as an attendant or shield carrier, doing simple but important tasks such as saddling a horse or caring for the knight's weapons and armor. The squire would sometimes carry the knight's flag into battle with his master.\n\nA knight typically took his squire into battle and gave him a chance to prove himself. If he proved his loyalty and skill in battle, he would have a \"[[Accolade|dubbing]]\", an official ceremony that made him a knight. However, during the Middle Ages, the squire's rank came to be recognized in its own right; it was no longer assumed that a squire would automatically become a knight. The connection between a squire and any particular knight also ended, as did any shield-carrying duties.\n\n=== Jobs ===\nThe typical jobs of a squire included:\n* Carrying the knight's [[armour]], [[shield]] and [[sword]]\n* Guarding prisoners\n* Ensuring an honourable [[burial]] for a knight\n* Replacing an injured or killed [[horse]]\n* Dressing the knight in armour\n* Carrying the knight's flag\n* Protecting the knight\n* Taking care of the horses\n* Accompanying the knight to [[Tournament (medieval)|tournaments]] and the battlefield\n* Maintaining the knight's equipment\n* Scrubbing armour\n\n=== In literature ===\nThe young [[King Arthur]] served as [[Sir Kay]]'s squire in the traditional tale of the [[Sword in the stone (King Arthur)|sword in the stone]] that appears in literary works, including ''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]'' and ''[[The Once and Future King]]''. One of the pilgrim-storytellers in ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'' is a squire whose father recounts the tale. In [[Cervantes]]'s ''[[Don Quixote]]'', the babbling [[Sancho Panza]] serves as squire of the deluded Don. In the children's book ''[[The Castle in the Attic]]'', the protagonist William serves as the squire of Sir Simon, a knight from the Middle Ages who got transported to the present.\n\n==Village leader==\nIn [[England|English]] [[village]] life from the late 17th century to the early 20th century, there was often one principal family of [[gentry]], owning much of the land and living in the largest house, maybe the [[manor house]]. The head of this family was often the [[lord of the manor]] and called \"the squire\". Lords of the manor held the rank of [[esquire]] by prescription.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Young|first1=John H.|title=Our Deportment \u2013 Or the Manners, Conduct and Dress of the Most Refined Society \u2014 Including Forms for Letters, Invitations, Etc., Etc. \u2013 Also Valuable Suggestions on Home Culture and Training \u2013 Compiled from the Latest Reliable Authorities|date=1843|publisher=F.B.

Many could claim descent from knights and had been settled in their inherited estates for hundreds of years. The squire usually lived at the village [[manor house]] and owned an [[estate (land)|estate]], comprising the village, with the villagers being his tenants. If the squire \"owned the living\" (i.e. \"was [[patron]]\") of the [[parish]] [[Church (building)|church]] \u2014 and he often did \u2014 he would choose the [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]], a role often filled by a younger son of the squire of that or another village. Some squires also became the local rector themselves and were known as squarsons;<ref>[http://www.le.ac.uk/lahs/downloads/AstonSmPagesfromvolumeLX-7.pdf Squarson]</ref> a ''[[portmanteau]]'' of the words ''squire'' and ''[[parson]]''. The squire would also have performed a number of important local duties, in particular that of justice of the peace or member of Parliament.\n\nSuch was the power of the squires at this time that modern historians have created the term 'squirearchy'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/squirearchy|title=squirearchy|publisher=|accessdate=12 December 2016|via=The Free Dictionary}}</ref> Politically, during the 19th century, squires tended to be [[Tories]], whereas the greatest landlords tended to be [[British Whig Party|Whigs]].\n\nThe position of squire was traditionally associated with occupation of the manor house, which would often itself confer the dignity of squire. It is unclear how widely the village squire may still be said to survive today, but where it does, the role is likely more dependent upon a recognition of [[Lineage (anthropology)|lineage]] and long family association rather than land, which, while relevant, is nowadays likely to be considerably smaller than in former years due to high post-war [[death duties]] and the prohibitive costs associated with maintaining large [[country house]]s.\n\nIn [[Scotland]], whilst esquire and gentleman are technically correctly used at the [[Court of the Lord Lyon]], the title [[laird]], in place of squire, is more common. Moreover, in Scotland, lairds append their territorial designation to their names as was traditionally done on the mainland of [[Europe]] (''e.g.'', Donald Cameron of Lochiel). The territorial designation fell into disuse in [[England]] early on, save for [[Peer of the realm|peers of the realm]].\n\n'''<big>Traditional Education</big>'''\n\nSquires did not receive much of any traditional education in the years that they were squires.\n\n=== In literature ===\nThe later form of squire as a gentleman appears in much of [[English literature]], for example in the form of [[Squire Trelawney]] in [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]'s ''[[Treasure Island]]''. [[William Makepeace Thackeray]] depicted a squire in ''[[Vanity Fair (novel)|Vanity Fair]]'' as a lecherous, ill-educated, badly mannered relic of an earlier age. However, he clearly shows their control of the life of the parish. Others include Squire Hamley in [[Elizabeth Gaskell]]'s ''[[Wives and Daughters]]'' and Squire Allworthy (based on [[Ralph Allen]]) in the novel ''[[The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling|Tom Jones]]'' by [[Henry Fielding]], who was himself a squire and magistrate. There is also a notable squire in [[Cormac McCarthy|Cormac McCarthy's]] ''[[Outer Dark]]'' and [[Charles Reade]]'s 1856 novel ''[[It Is Never Too Late to Mend (novel)|It is Never Too Late to Mend]]'', where the squire uses his authority to abuse the postal and judicial services. In the [[Aubrey-Maturin series]] of novels by [[Patrick O'Brian]], Jack Aubrey's father, General Aubrey and later Jack himself, are typical squires.\n\n[[Mary Ann Evans]], alias [[George Eliot]], includes Squire Cass as a character in her novel ''[[Silas Marner]]''. One of the main characters of [[Anthony Trollope]]'s ''[[Doctor Thorne]]'', published in 1858, is Squire Francis Newbold Gresham. [[Sherlock Holmes]]' ancestors are mentioned to be country squires in Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's stories.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://etc.usf.edu/lit2go/40/the-memoirs-of-sherlock-holmes/581/adventure-9-the-greek-interpreter/|title=Adventure 9: \"The Greek Interpreter\" - The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes - Sir Arthur Conan Doyle - Lit2Go ETC|publisher=|accessdate=12 December 2016}}</ref>\n\n==National variations==\n{{main|Esquire}}\n\n=== England ===\nThe \"Royal Esquires\" of the late-medieval English Court were not young men studying for knighthood. Far more frequently, and certainly from [[Edward III of England|Edward III]] to [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]], they tended to be men of a similar age to the [[monarch]]; having his complete trust.\n\nIn the 15th century ''Black Book of the Household''\u2014a set of ordinances composed for [[Edward IV of England|Edward IV]] for the \"Governance and Regulation of the Royal Household\"\u2014the king had only four \"Esquires for the Bodie\"; these were the most senior servants in the royal household, with total access to the royal person at all hours. They were the senior staff of the privy chamber, and the closest of the king's \"Affinity\" (i.e., his most intimate daily companions), and were the only servants in the household who were required&mdash;not just allowed&mdash;to bear arms in the king's presence, as one of their duties was to act as bodyguards \"of last resort\" in the event of an immediate threat to the royal person.\n\nIn times of war when their royal master was \"under arms\" himself, they would also fight at his side. They oversaw his pages and the other lesser servants of the [[privy chamber]] and acted as his valet, and stood guard while he was shaved, washed or bathed. One stood behind his chair when he dined. Squires accompanied him at play, including wagering with him on the results of games (see wagers lost and won recorded in the account books of [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]], each page signed by the king, [[the National Archives (United Kingdom)|National Archives at Kew]]) and delivered confidential messages of all kinds.\n\nEdward IV and [[Richard III of England|Richard III]] only appointed four esquires each. Henry VII appointed four of his closest \"companions of Our late Exile\" within days of his victory at the [[Battle of Bosworth Field]] on 22 August 1485,<ref>see Calendar of Patent Rolls, H7, Sept/Oct 1485, National Archives at Kew</ref> and an extra five esquires by the end of his reign in 1509.<ref>Patent Warrants of Appointment, and Warrants to the Exchequer for the payments of their annual Salaries are comprehensively-listed in \"Materials for a History of King Henry VII\" ed W. Campbell, Pub. by the Treasury for the Master of the Rolls (vol. i, 1873; vol. ii, 1877)</ref> His son Henry VIII retained his father's esquires of the body while dismissing others of his father's senior officers and even executing some (for example, [[Richard Empson]] and [[Edmund Dudley]]), but he vastly increased the number of that select group, as he enlarged the rest of the royal household as set down in the \"Statutes of Eltham\". The position was highly regarded, for the value of its close access to the king. At least two notable late-medieval gentles are recorded contemporaneously as refusing knighthood, declaring that to be an \"[[Esquire of the Body]]\" was a far-greater honour.\n\nIn the post-medieval world, the title of esquire came to belong to all men of the higher [[landed gentry]]; an esquire ranked socially above a [[gentleman]] but below a [[knight]]. In the modern world, the term has correspondingly often been extended (albeit only in very formal writing) to all men without any higher title. It is used post-nominally, usually in abbreviated form: \"John Smith, Esq.\", for example.\n\n==== As an informal term ====\n* The term ''squire'' is sometimes used, particularly in [[London]] and its environs, by men when addressing another man. In this context, it is interchangeable with other informal terms such as ''mate'', ''pal'' or ''chum'', though often with a humorous intent.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/squire|title=squire - definition of squire in English - Oxford Dictionaries|publisher=|accessdate=12 December 2016}}</ref> This usage crops up frequently in [[comedy sketch]]es by [[Monty Python]], such as: \"What can I do for you, squire?\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.montypython.net/scripts/undertaker.php|title=Monty Python: The Undertakers Sketch|publisher=|accessdate=12 December 2016}}</ref>\n* The German term for squire, ''Knappe'', sometimes also is a name for [[journeyman]] and similar occupations (originally probably as \"esquires\" to the master as their \"knight\"). Among others this gave rise to the alternative term ''Bergknappe'' (\"mountain squire\") for a miner; ''Die Knappen'' (plural form) is a nickname for the team of the soccer club [[FC Schalke 04]].\n\n=== United States ===\nIn the [[United States]], this style is most common among [[Lawyer|lawyers]], borrowing from the English tradition whereby all [[barrister]]s were styled \"esquires\". ([[Solicitors]] were entitled only to the style \"Mr\".) In earlier years in the U.S., the title squire was given to a justice of the peace, for example Squire Jones.  It was also used to mean justice of the peace as in the example, \"He was taken before the squire.\"  The connection to attorneys appears to have evolved from a time when squires meeting to negotiate a duel would instead [[Trial by combat|resolve the dispute]]. {{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Titles]]\n[[Category:Gentry]]\n[[Category:Gendered occupations]]\n", "text_old": "{{Other uses|Squire (disambiguation)|Squires (disambiguation)}}\n{{refimprove|date=June 2007}}\n[[File:Helmeted Medieval Knight or Soldier (5).JPG|thumb|{{center|A knight and his squire}}]]\n[[File:Codex Manesse 149v Wolfram von Eschenbach.jpg|thumb|[[Wolfram von Eschenbach]] and his squire ([[Codex Manesse]], 14th century)]]\n[[File:J Mathuysen Knappe in einer Waffenkammer.jpg|thumb|A squire cleaning [[armour]]]]\n[[File:Malbork rekonstrukcja 2009 (8).JPG|thumb|A squire helping his knight, in a [[historical reenactment]] in 2009]]\n[[File:RichardStapledon Monument (Detail) ExeterCathedral.PNG|thumb|A squire holds the warhorse of his knight, detail from monument to Sir [[Richard Stapledon]] (d.1326), [[Exeter Cathedral]].<ref>The figures are \"a touching early tenthteenth-century visual representation of the [[knight]] with his immediate following ... a knight is shown accompanied by his squire, [[Page (servant)|page]] and horse\".(Prestwich, Michael, ''Armies and Warfare in the Middle Ages: The English Experience'', London, 1996, p.49 [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=fFdBfrlM0YQC&pg=PA49&lpg=PA49&dq=richard+de+stapledon+exeter&source=bl&ots=7AbjAR2rEz&sig=Sy7iYtV-N7KEUDaBE5rlFQGubQU&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiL7puflt_LAhXJuRoKHTk5CVkQ6AEITjAI#v=onepage&q=richard%20de%20stapledon%20exeter&f=false])</ref>]]\nStarting in the Middle Ages, a '''squire''' was the [[shield]]- or [[armour]]-bearer of a [[knight]].<ref name=\"mw\">{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/squire|title=Definition of Squire|publisher=|accessdate=12 December 2016}}</ref> \n\nUse of the term evolved over time.

If he proved his loyalty and skill in battle, he would have a \"[[Accolade|dubbing]]\", an official ceremony that made him a knight. However, during the Middle Ages, the squire's rank came to be recognized in its own right; it was no longer assumed that a squire would automatically become a knight. The connection between a squire and any particular knight also ended, as did any shield-carrying duties.\n\n=== Jobs ===\nThe typical jobs of a squire included:\n* Carrying the knight's [[armour]], [[shield]] and [[sword]]\n* Guarding prisoners\n* Ensuring an honourable [[burial]] for a knight\n* Replacing an injured or killed [[horse]]\n* Dressing the knight in armour\n* Carrying the knight's flag\n* Protecting the knight\n* Taking care of the horses\n* Accompanying the knight to [[Tournament (medieval)|tournaments]] and the battlefield\n* Maintaining the knight's equipment\n* Scrubbing armour\n\n=== In literature ===\nThe young [[King Arthur]] served as [[Sir Kay]]'s squire in the traditional tale of the [[Sword in the stone (King Arthur)|sword in the stone]] that appears in literary works, including ''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]'' and ''[[The Once and Future King]]''. One of the pilgrim-storytellers in ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'' is a squire whose father recounts the tale. In [[Cervantes]]'s ''[[Don Quixote]]'', the babbling [[Sancho Panza]] serves as squire of the deluded Don. In the children's book ''[[The Castle in the Attic]]'', the protagonist William serves as the squire of Sir Simon, a knight from the Middle Ages who got transported to the present.\n\n==Village leader==\nIn [[England|English]] [[village]] life from the late 17th century to the early 20th century, there was often one principal family of [[gentry]], owning much of the land and living in the largest house, maybe the [[manor house]]. The head of this family was often the [[lord of the manor]] and called \"the squire\". Lords of the manor held the rank of [[esquire]] by prescription.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Young|first1=John H.|title=Our Deportment \u2013 Or the Manners, Conduct and Dress of the Most Refined Society \u2014 Including Forms for Letters, Invitations, Etc., Etc. \u2013 Also Valuable Suggestions on Home Culture and Training \u2013 Compiled from the Latest Reliable Authorities|date=1843|publisher=F.B.

Many could claim descent from knights and had been settled in their inherited estates for hundreds of years. The squire usually lived at the village [[manor house]] and owned an [[estate (land)|estate]], comprising the village, with the villagers being his tenants. If the squire \"owned the living\" (i.e. \"was [[patron]]\") of the [[parish]] [[Church (building)|church]] \u2014 and he often did \u2014 he would choose the [[Rector (ecclesiastical)|rector]], a role often filled by a younger son of the squire of that or another village. Some squires also became the local rector themselves and were known as squarsons;<ref>[http://www.le.ac.uk/lahs/downloads/AstonSmPagesfromvolumeLX-7.pdf Squarson]</ref> a ''[[portmanteau]]'' of the words ''squire'' and ''[[parson]]''. The squire would also have performed a number of important local duties, in particular that of justice of the peace or member of Parliament.\n\nSuch was the power of the squires at this time that modern historians have created the term 'squirearchy'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/squirearchy|title=squirearchy|publisher=|accessdate=12 December 2016|via=The Free Dictionary}}</ref> Politically, during the 19th century, squires tended to be [[Tories]], whereas the greatest landlords tended to be [[British Whig Party|Whigs]].\n\nThe position of squire was traditionally associated with occupation of the manor house, which would often itself confer the dignity of squire. It is unclear how widely the village squire may still be said to survive today, but where it does, the role is likely more dependent upon a recognition of [[Lineage (anthropology)|lineage]] and long family association rather than land, which, while relevant, is nowadays likely to be considerably smaller than in former years due to high post-war [[death duties]] and the prohibitive costs associated with maintaining large [[country house]]s.\n\nIn [[Scotland]], whilst esquire and gentleman are technically correctly used at the [[Court of the Lord Lyon]], the title [[laird]], in place of squire, is more common. Moreover, in Scotland, lairds append their territorial designation to their names as was traditionally done on the mainland of [[Europe]] (''e.g.'', Donald Cameron of Lochiel). The territorial designation fell into disuse in [[England]] early on, save for [[Peer of the realm|peers of the realm]].\n\n'''<big>Traditional Education</big>'''\n\nSquires did not receive much of any traditional education in the years that they were squires.\n\n=== In literature ===\nThe later form of squire as a gentleman appears in much of [[English literature]], for example in the form of [[Squire Trelawney]] in [[Robert Louis Stevenson]]'s ''[[Treasure Island]]''. [[William Makepeace Thackeray]] depicted a squire in ''[[Vanity Fair (novel)|Vanity Fair]]'' as a lecherous, ill-educated, badly mannered relic of an earlier age. However, he clearly shows their control of the life of the parish. Others include Squire Hamley in [[Elizabeth Gaskell]]'s ''[[Wives and Daughters]]'' and Squire Allworthy (based on [[Ralph Allen]]) in the novel ''[[The History of Tom Jones, a Foundling|Tom Jones]]'' by [[Henry Fielding]], who was himself a squire and magistrate. There is also a notable squire in [[Cormac McCarthy|Cormac McCarthy's]] ''[[Outer Dark]]'' and [[Charles Reade]]'s 1856 novel ''[[It Is Never Too Late to Mend (novel)|It is Never Too Late to Mend]]'', where the squire uses his authority to abuse the postal and judicial services. In the [[Aubrey-Maturin series]] of novels by [[Patrick O'Brian]], Jack Aubrey's father, General Aubrey and later Jack himself, are typical squires.\n\n[[Mary Ann Evans]], alias [[George Eliot]], includes Squire Cass as a character in her novel ''[[Silas Marner]]''. One of the main characters of [[Anthony Trollope]]'s ''[[Doctor Thorne]]'', published in 1858, is Squire Francis Newbold Gresham. [[Sherlock Holmes]]' ancestors are mentioned to be country squires in Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's stories.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://etc.usf.edu/lit2go/40/the-memoirs-of-sherlock-holmes/581/adventure-9-the-greek-interpreter/|title=Adventure 9: \"The Greek Interpreter\" - The Memoirs of Sherlock Holmes - Sir Arthur Conan Doyle - Lit2Go ETC|publisher=|accessdate=12 December 2016}}</ref>\n\n==National variations==\n{{main|Esquire}}\n\n=== England ===\nThe \"Royal Esquires\" of the late-medieval English Court were not young men studying for knighthood. Far more frequently, and certainly from [[Edward III of England|Edward III]] to [[Henry VIII of England|Henry VIII]], they tended to be men of a similar age to the [[monarch]]; having his complete trust.\n\nIn the 15th century ''Black Book of the Household''\u2014a set of ordinances composed for [[Edward IV of England|Edward IV]] for the \"Governance and Regulation of the Royal Household\"\u2014the king had only four \"Esquires for the Bodie\"; these were the most senior servants in the royal household, with total access to the royal person at all hours. They were the senior staff of the privy chamber, and the closest of the king's \"Affinity\" (i.e., his most intimate daily companions), and were the only servants in the household who were required&mdash;not just allowed&mdash;to bear arms in the king's presence, as one of their duties was to act as bodyguards \"of last resort\" in the event of an immediate threat to the royal person.\n\nIn times of war when their royal master was \"under arms\" himself, they would also fight at his side. They oversaw his pages and the other lesser servants of the [[privy chamber]] and acted as his valet, and stood guard while he was shaved, washed or bathed. One stood behind his chair when he dined. Squires accompanied him at play, including wagering with him on the results of games (see wagers lost and won recorded in the account books of [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]], each page signed by the king, [[the National Archives (United Kingdom)|National Archives at Kew]]) and delivered confidential messages of all kinds.\n\nEdward IV and [[Richard III of England|Richard III]] only appointed four esquires each. Henry VII appointed four of his closest \"companions of Our late Exile\" within days of his victory at the [[Battle of Bosworth Field]] on 22 August 1485,<ref>see Calendar of Patent Rolls, H7, Sept/Oct 1485, National Archives at Kew</ref> and an extra five esquires by the end of his reign in 1509.<ref>Patent Warrants of Appointment, and Warrants to the Exchequer for the payments of their annual Salaries are comprehensively-listed in \"Materials for a History of King Henry VII\" ed W. Campbell, Pub. by the Treasury for the Master of the Rolls (vol. i, 1873; vol. ii, 1877)</ref> His son Henry VIII retained his father's esquires of the body while dismissing others of his father's senior officers and even executing some (for example, [[Richard Empson]] and [[Edmund Dudley]]), but he vastly increased the number of that select group, as he enlarged the rest of the royal household as set down in the \"Statutes of Eltham\". The position was highly regarded, for the value of its close access to the king. At least two notable late-medieval gentles are recorded contemporaneously as refusing knighthood, declaring that to be an \"[[Esquire of the Body]]\" was a far-greater honour.\n\nIn the post-medieval world, the title of esquire came to belong to all men of the higher [[landed gentry]]; an esquire ranked socially above a [[gentleman]] but below a [[knight]]. In the modern world, the term has correspondingly often been extended (albeit only in very formal writing) to all men without any higher title. It is used post-nominally, usually in abbreviated form: \"John Smith, Esq.\", for example.\n\n==== As an informal term ====\n* The term ''squire'' is sometimes used, particularly in [[London]] and its environs, by men when addressing another man. In this context, it is interchangeable with other informal terms such as ''mate'', ''pal'' or ''chum'', though often with a humorous intent.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/squire|title=squire - definition of squire in English - Oxford Dictionaries|publisher=|accessdate=12 December 2016}}</ref> This usage crops up frequently in [[comedy sketch]]es by [[Monty Python]], such as: \"What can I do for you, squire?\".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.montypython.net/scripts/undertaker.php|title=Monty Python: The Undertakers Sketch|publisher=|accessdate=12 December 2016}}</ref>\n* The German term for squire, ''Knappe'', sometimes also is a name for [[journeyman]] and similar occupations (originally probably as \"esquires\" to the master as their \"knight\"). Among others this gave rise to the alternative term ''Bergknappe'' (\"mountain squire\") for a miner; ''Die Knappen'' (plural form) is a nickname for the team of the soccer club [[FC Schalke 04]].\n\n=== United States ===\nIn the [[United States]], this style is most common among [[Lawyer|lawyers]], borrowing from the English tradition whereby all [[barrister]]s were styled \"esquires\". ([[Solicitors]] were entitled only to the style \"Mr\".) In earlier years in the U.S., the title squire was given to a justice of the peace, for example Squire Jones.  It was also used to mean justice of the peace as in the example, \"He was taken before the squire.\"  The connection to attorneys appears to have evolved from a time when squires meeting to negotiate a duel would instead [[Trial by combat|resolve the dispute]]. {{citation needed|date=February 2016}}\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n[[Category:Titles]]\n[[Category:Gentry]]\n[[Category:Gendered occupations]]\n", "name_user": "Heyymann39485647483928283867", "label": "unsafe", "comment": "(Fixed typo)", "url_page": "//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Squire"}
